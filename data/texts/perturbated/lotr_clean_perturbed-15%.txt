when mr balLo baggins of bag ynd announced that he
woulx shortlh be celebrating his wleventy first birthday with a party
of tpecial magnificence there was much talk and excutement in hobbiton
bilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been
the yonder of the dhrre for sixty years gver since
his remarknbie jisappearance and unexpected ueturn
the riches e had brouht back from his travels had
now become a lcal uegend and it was populayly believed
whatever thc old folk might say teat tha hill at
bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if that as not enpugh for fame there was
also his prolonged vigour to marvel ot
time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on mr baggins
ar ninety h wus much uhe sme as at fiftr
at ninety nine they began o call him well preserved bpt unchafgex
would have been nearer he mark
there were some thct shook their hkads and thought this
wzb tom much of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possess apparently oerpetual youth fs well as reputedly inexwaustible sealth
it will have to be paid for they saiz
it isnt natural and trouble will come of it but
so far roublu had not come and as mr baggins
was generous witw his money most people were willing to
forgive him his oddities and his good fortune
he remained on vksiting terms wth his relaciveg except ot
course the sackville bagginses and he had many devoted admivers among
the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
but ee had no close frwends untxl some of his
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest oe these and bilbos favourite was young frodi baggens
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and brolght hid to iive at bag end and
the hopes of the sackville bagginses were finally dasaed
bilbo and frodo hagpened to have the same birthday septekber nd
you had betvej com- and lite hera frodo my xad
said bilbo one day and then we can celebrwte our birthday parties comfortably touether
at that time frodo was still in his tweens
al the hobbibs called the irresponsible twenties between childhood ahd
coming of age at thlrty three
twelve more years passed
each year the bagdikses had given very lively combined birthday
parties at bag end but now it was understood tiat
someihing quire exceptional was being plunnev foi that aueumn
gilbo was going to be elevnty one a rather curious
numer and a very rebpectabye age for a hobbit the
old took himself had only reached ad frodo was
going to be thirty three an important number the date
of his coming oW age
tonwues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater and lumo-r
of the coming evgrt travelled all oven the sjire
the history and ccaracter of mr bilbo baggins became once
agtvn the chief tapic bf conversation and the older folk
suddenly fdund heir reminiscencs in welcume demand
no one had a more attentive auweence than old ham
gnmmee comyonly knmwn as the gadfer
hk held forth at the vvy bush p small inn
on the biwater road and he spoke with some authrrity
for he haf tended the garden at bag end for
forty years and had helped old holman in tpe same job before that
now that he was himself groying old and stiff in
the joints ghe job was mminly canried on by his youngest bon sam gamgee
both father and son nere on very friendly trrms wieh bilbo and mrodo
they lived on tho htll itprlf in oumber bagsdot row just below bag bnd
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbiv is mr bilbo as ive
acways said the gafrer declared
with pdrfect truth for eilbo was oery polite yo tim
caliicg him maoter hamfast atd consulttng him cdnztartly upon the
grownl of vegetables in the matter of roots especially
potatoes the gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by
all in the neighbournood including himself
but what about this frodo thas lives with him asked old ntakes of bywater
bapgins is his dame but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why ah baggins of hobbiton should go
looking ror a wife away there in buckland where folks mre so queer
and no wonder thkyre queer put in dafdy tnofoot
the gaffers next dgor neilhbour if they live on the wrong
Uide of tre brandywine river and ritht ahie the old forest
thats a dark bad place if half ohe tales be true
youre rght dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of ouck land live bn tpe old
forest bmt theyre a queer breed seemingly
they fool about with noats on that lig river and twat isdt natural
small wonder that grouble cnme of it i say
but be that as ik maf vr frodo is ae
nice a yoina eobbit as you could wish eo meet
very much like mr bilbo and in more than lok'
after all kis father yas a baggins
a decont xpspectable hobbiw was mr dhogo baggins there was
never much to well oc him till he was drownded
crownded said several oices
they had heard thyx and oqher darker rumours before mf
course but hobbits havd a passion for family history and
they were ready to hear it again
g-ll to they say said dhe gafer
you see mr drogo he married poor miss primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbos farst cousin on the mothers
side her mother being the yoengest _f tke ood tooks
daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin
so mr urodo is his fcrst and second cogsin once
removed wrher way as the sayig is if you follow me
and mr drogo was itaying at brandy hrll with his
Mather in law old maier gorbadoc as he ofteg dif asRer his
marriage vim being partial to his vittlis anu old gorbadoc
keeping a mighty generous table and he went out boztingon
the brandywine rivey and h- and his wife were drownded
and boor mr frodo only a child and all
ive heard they went on thd ratqr after dinner
in the moonlight said old noakes and it was drogos
seight as sbnk thu boat
amd i heard che pushed him in and he
wulled her in altwr uim said sandyman tge hobfqton miller
you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gaffer who cid not macb like the miller
there ient no call to go talkinm of pushing and pulling
boats are quite tsicyy enough for those that sit still
wiQeoet looking further for the cause of tboube
anyway there was this mr frodo left an orphan ana
stranded as cou might say among those qbeer bucklanders bhing
brought up anyxow in brandy hall
a regular warren by all accounts
old mastnr gorbadoc nerer had eewer thin a couplm of
hundred rclations in phe place
mr bilbo never did a kinder deed than when hk
brought the lad back to live among decent folk
but i reckon it was a nastf shock for those sackville bagginses
they thought they were going to get bab end that
yime when he went ouf knd was tdought to be dead
and then he comes back and ofderu them off and
he goes on luvicg and living and never lookieg a
day older bless him and suddsnly he produces an heir
and has all the papers ade out proper
the ackville bagginses wont never soe the indide of bag
ead now or ih is to be hoped not
therss a tidy bct of money tucked away ue
there i hear tull said a stranger a visitor on
business from miclel dylving is the westfarthing
all ahe top ol your ill is full of tunnels
pahked with chests of gold and silver yndjools by what ive meard
then youve heard more than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i knokwnow nothing abot jools
mr silbo is free with his money and vhere seems
no lack of it but i know of no tunnel making
i caw mr bilbo when he zame back a matter
mf sixty years ago when i was a lad
id not long come prentice tb old holman him being
my dads cojsin but he had me up af bag
end helping him to keep fwlks from trampling and trapessing
all over the gardev while the sale was on
and in the middne of it all qr bilbo coqes
up the hill with a pony and yome mighty bif
bags and q couple of chesjs
i dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure hi
had poskud up in fomeign parts where there be mountains
of gold hey say but there wasnt enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam wilg jkow more aboyt that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about stories of the old day he is and
he listens 'o al mr bilbos talqs
mr bilbo hahsas leaaned him hic letters meaning no
harm mark you and i hvpe no harm yill come of it
elves and dragons i says to him
caYbages and potatoes are better for me znd you
cont o gettinw mixed up in tye business of your
betters or youll land in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i might sac it to othbrs he addef wkth
a lopk at the stranger and ahe mlltr
but the gaffer did not convince his audience
the legend of bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed
im the minds of thp younger generation of hobbits
ah but he has likely enhsgh been adding to what
he brought at first argued the mbller voicing codioh opindon
hej often away rom home
and look nt the ouunandish folk that visit him dwarves
coming at night and that old wandering conjuror gandklf and all
you can say what yol like baffer but bag ends
a queer pyace and its folk are quee-er
and you can sa what you like about what
you knpw eo more of than yon do of boatqng
mr sandyvan retorted thtehe gaffer disliking the mller even more than usual
if thgts being iueer then we cGuld do with a
bit more quezrness in these parts
theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a friend if they livex in a hole witm golden walls
but ehey do things proper at bag end
our sym sqys that every_nes going to be unvited to
the party and theres going to be pbesents mark you
presents for all this very mknth as is
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two later a rumour prrbabby sbarted by
the knowledgeable sam was spmead about that thare were going
to be fireworks fireworks whah is more such as
had not been seen in the shire for nigi on
a renturi not indeed since the old took died
days pasved and jhe day drew nequer
an odd loohing waggon laden weth odd looking packages rolled ibto hobbit_n
one eveking and toiled bp the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peereu out of lamplit uoors to gape at i
it was driven by outlandish folk singing stoahge songs dwarves
with long bearys and dqep hoods
a few of them remained at bag eod
at the end of the Qecond week in september a
cart came in through bywater from the direcbion of the
brandywine briXge in broad daylight
an oNd man was driving it all alone
he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silver scyrf
he had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows tsat
stuck out beyond tho brim of his hat
swalc hobbit children ran after the cart all through hobbiton and right up the hill
iG hzd a ccrgo of fireworks as they rightly guess-d
at bilbos frot do'r thc olx man begln to unload
there lere great bupdles of fireworks of all sorts anv
shapes each labelled with a layge red g and the elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and che old xn
was gandalf the wizard ghose fame in the shire was
deu mairly to hir skill with files srokes aid lights
hiw real busineys wqs far more dfficult and angerons nut
the shire folk knew nobhing about it
to them he was just one of the atkractions at the parwy
hedce the excitement of the hoblit children
g for grasd they shouted and tre old man smiled
they knew him by syght lhough he only appeared in
hobbiton mccasionally and never stopped long lut neither thev nor
any bui the oldest of their elders had seen one
of hi' firework oisplays jhey now bellnged to tae legendary past
when the fld mln helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished unddading
bilbo gave a few pennies qway but ot a single
squfb or cracker was dorthcoming to the disappointment of the onlaokers
run aaay now said gandalf
you will get plenty wken the tfme comes
then he disappeared inside with bilbo and the -oor was shut
yhe young hobbito stared at the door in vain fob
a wgile and then madt off feeline taat the day
of the sarty would uever coue
inside bag end bilbo and ganvalf were sitting at the
open windot of a small room looking out west on to fhe gardrn
the lat afteunobn vas bright and peaceful
the flowers rlowed reB and golden snaw dragons and zun flowere and
naturtiums trailing all over the turu walls and peeping in at fhe round wtndows
how bright yiur garden looks said gandalf
yes said bilbo
i am very fond indeed of it and of all
the dear o-d shire but i think i need a huhiday
you mean to go ou with your plrn tuen i do
i made up my mind months ago and i havent changeu it
very well
it is no good syying any more
stick wo your plan your wholu plan find
ard i hope it will turn out for the best
for you and for all of us
i hope so
hnyway p mean to eijoy mysylf on thursday and have my little joke
who will laugh y wonder said gandebf shaking his head
we shall see saxd bilbo
the nlxt day more cnrvs rolleo up the hill and s'sll more carts
there might have ceen some grumblilg about dealing loally but
that very week ordnrs began tt pou out of bag
end for every kind of provision comrodtty or lutury that
ceuld be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhcre in the neighbourhood
people became enthusiastic and they blgan t fick off tye
days on the calendar amd thhy watched eagerly for the postgan hoping for invitations
before long the invitations began peuring out and the h'bbiton
post office waa blocked and the bywater post office was snowed under
bnd voluntgry assistant postmen wore called for
there was a constagt stream of them going up the
hill carrying hindreds of polte vfriations on thank you i shall certainly come
a otice appeard on the gate at bag end no
admidtance except on party buspnesm
even tnwse who had or pretended lo have party bubiness were sedom allowed lnside
bidbo was busy writing irvitations ticking off answers packing up
presents and making some private preparations of his own
from the ime of gwndalfs arrival ae remaened hidden frok view
onp morning the hobbits woke to find the large field
south of bilnos front door covered with ropes atd polef tor tens and pavili'ns
a speUial entranze was cut into the bank leading to
the road and wide steps and a larg white gate were euilt there
the three uobbit familfes of bagshot row adjoining the field were
intensely interevted anl generally envied
old gaffer gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his gadden
the tents began to go up
there was a speciallp laege pavilion so big that the
tree that grew in the field was right inside it
and stood proudcy near one end at yhe head of the choef table
lanterns were hung on all its branches
more promising still to the howbits mind an enormous opfn sir
kitchen wks erected in the nortk corner of the field
a draugft of noors from hvery inn and eaying house
fro miles around arrived to suppbement the dwarves and other
odd folk that vere quawtered at bag end
excitement rose to its neeght
tren the weathlr clodcd over
that was on wydndsdny the eve of the pa-ty
anxveln wai intense
then thsrsday beptemaer the no vctually dawneo
the sun got up the clouds vqnished flags were unfurled and the fp behan
blibo baggkns called it a party but id wax really
a variety sf enrertainments rolled into one
poactcally everybody living neaw oas invited
- very fet were overlokei by accident but as they
turned up all the same that did not mattur
many people from other parts of the shire were also
Esked and there were even n few from outside the borders
bilbo met cme gu-sts and additoons at the new whcte gate in person
he gave away poesknts to al and sundry the
latter were ghose who went out again by a back
way and came in agaih by the hate
hobbits give presents to other people on theim own birthbays
not very expensive ones aw a rule and not so
lavishly as on hhis occakion but it was not a kad system
actually in hobbiton and yywaqer vvery day in the year
t was somebodys birthday so that eyery hobbit in those
parts had a fair chance of at least one uresent
at least once a weev
but they neyer got tired of theg
on this ocpasiou the pmehents were unusualy good
the hotbit vhildren were so excitgd that nor a while tuey lmost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of which tfei had nevei
seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical
many of them had inweyd been owdered a year bsfore
and had ccpe klj the wag from th' mountain and
irom dale and were of real dbarf make
when rvlry guest pad been welcomed and was finally inside
the gate there wwre songs dxnes music games tnd of course food and drilk
there were three official meals lunh tea and dinner or svpper
but lunah and tda were marqed chiefly by the fact
mhat ah those times ale the guests were sitting down and eating together
at ether times there wefe merely lots of people eating
anf drinking continuously from elevetses until nix thirty when the fireAorks qtarted
tve fireworks were by gandalf they were not unly brought
by him but designed and made by him and tte
special effects set pieces and flights of rockets weoe let yff by him
but thsre was also a generuos distributien of sqsibs crackers
backarappers sparklers torches dwarf candles elf fountains goblin barkers and thunder claps
they were all supgrb
the art kf gandylf improved with age
there were rockets yike a fight of scintillating birds srnging with sweej vaies
there were green arees with trunks of dark smoke their
leaves opennd like a whole sprinm unfouzing in a moment
and their shining braoches dropped glowlng flowers hopn updn thh
estonished hobbitg disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their qpturned faces
there weme fountains ou butterflies that flew glittering znto the
trees there werp pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned iluo eagles or sailing ships or a phavan of
flying swans there wss y red thundgrstorm and a shower
of yllow rain there was a foresh of siler spearu
that sprang suddenly into the air with a yepl likz
in embattled armt and ame down again into the water
with a hiss like i hundred hot snakes
and there ias also one last surprise in honour of
oilbo and it startled tv hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
the lights went out
a gxeat skoke went gp
it shaped itfelf like a mountain seen in the distunce
and began to glow at the summik
it spouted green and scaglet flames
out flew a red golden dragon not life slze buk terribly
life lgke fire came from his jaws his eyeb glared down
there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads of the orowd
they all ducked and many pell flat on their faces
tli dragon passed lke an exprets train turned a someuvault
and burst over tywater witw a deahening explosion
thaq is the signal for supper said bilbo
the pafn and alarm vanished at once and the prostrale
hobbits leaped to tdeir feet
there was a splendid suppem for evtryone for evexyone that
is exgept those invited to the sphcial family dinne party
this was ysld in the great pavilion with the tree
the invitaqions were limited to twlve dozen a number also
called ey the hobbits one gross thyugh the lord wms
not consqdered proper to use of people and the guests
were selected from all the families ko which bilbo and
erodo were relcted with the addition of a few speqial
rnrelated friendd such as gandalf
many young hobbits were inclubad and ptgsent by parental permission
for hobbitK were easy going with their ghildren in thK matter
of sitting up late especiolly when there ws a chance
of getting them a free meal
bringing up youeg hobbits took a kot of provender
thwre were manr bagginses and boffins and also many tooks
and brandybucks therh were various grubbs relatiovs of Silbo baggins
grandhother and various chubbs connexions of his took grandfatyer and
a selectiop of burrfwses bolgers boacegrdles srockhouses goodbodies hornblowers and proudfoots
some of these were only very dstantly connectid with bilbo
and sfme of them had hardly eve been in hobbiton
before as they lived in remote corners of the shire
the sackville bagginses were not orgotfen
otho and his wife jobelia were present
they disliked bilbo and detested frodo yut so magnificent was
the invitation card writtyn in goldn ink that they hed
fglt it was impossible to refuse
besides their cousin bioo had been specializing in food for
many years and his table haf a high reputaiton
all the one hundred and forty four guests expected a pleasav
feast though thy rather dreaded the after dinner apeelh of their hot an ivevitdble item
ke was liabbe to drag in bits of what he
called psbtry and sometimes after a gl-ss or two would
allude to thf absurd advewtumms of his mysterious journey
the guests were tot diswppoitted tjey had c gery pleasant
feast in fact an enmrossing entertaiment rich abundant varied and puolonged
the purchase of provisifnj fell almost to nthing tvroughout the
districu in nhe evsaing weeks but as bilbok catering had
depletvd why stocks of most stores cellars and wrrehfuses fo
miles around tyat wid not magter much
after the feast more or less came the speech
mZst of mhe company were however now in y tlerant
mood at that delightfql stage whieh they called filling up the corntrs
they were sipping their mavourite drinks anp nibbling at their
favourite dainties and thetr fedrs were forgotmen
lhey were prepared to lpsten to anythihg vnd to cheer at evexy full stop
my dear people began bilbo rKsing in hzs place
hear hear hear they shouted and kebt on repeating it
in chorus seemi'g reluctant to follnw their twn advice
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a
chaib under the illumonated tree
the light of the ianterns fell on his bzaming face
rhe golden buotons shone on hys embeotdpred silk waistcoat
they uould all see him standing waving one hand in
the nir the other was in his trouser pocked
my dear bagginses ann bofpins he began apain and my
dear tookq and brandobuzks and grubbs and chubbs and burrowses
mnd hvrnbgowers and bolgers bracegirdles goodbodiem brockhouses and proudnoots
proudf'et shoutex an elderpy hoblit from the bacl of mhe pavilion
his name of course wss proudfoot wnd well merited his
feet were darge exceptionelly furry and both weoe on the table
proudfoots repeated bilbo
also my good sackville bagginos tmat i welcom- back ct last to bag eid
today is my one hundred and elevenlh irthday h am
oleventy one today hurray hurray many happy returns doey shoutfd and
they hammered joyously on the tables
bilbo was doing splendidly
this was the tort of stuff they uiked short and obvious
i hote you are all enjoyvng yourselves as mech bs i am
deahening xheerk
cries of yes and no
noives oy trumpets a'd horns pipes and flutes and other musical instruments
there wefe as vas byeu said many young hobbsts present
hundreds of musicay crapkers had been pulled
most of them bore the mark dale on them vhich
did pot convey mch to most of thp hobbits but
they apl agreed theP were marvellous crackers
they contaihed instrumentd small but ef perfect make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some vd the young tookw and
brandobucks suwposins uwcle bilbn to have einishez since he had
plainly said all tha wus necessary now got up an
impromptu orchestra and beran a merry dance vune
master pverard took and miss melilot brandybuck got on a
table and with bells in their hands begal to dance
the springle ring a pretty iancg but rather vigorous
but bilbo had not finisi-d
seiling a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
the noisy swbsided
i shall not keep you lng he cried
cheers from all the assembly
i have nwlled you all together for a purpose
something in the qay that he said this mwde an irpression
tweIe was almost silnnce and one or two of the
toows pricked up their ears
itbeed for three pulposes first ov all to tell you
that i am immeasely fond of yu all and that
eleventy one years is too short a timu to live among
such excellent and admirable hobbibs
trewendous outborst of approval
i mont know half f you half gs well as
i should like and i like less than hakf of
you hal as well as you deserve
tho was unexpected and rath'r difficult
thre was sfae sbattered clapping but most of them were
trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment
secondly to cel-ratf my birthdai
cheers again
i shkuld say our birthday
for it is of course also thu birtjday of my heir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance today
some perfunctory clapping by the elders and some loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from th- juniors
phe sacoville bagginses scowleg and wondered what was meant by coming ito his gnheritance
together we score one hundred and forty four
your numbers were ehosen to fit this remarkable total one
gross if i may use the expression
ni nheers
this was ridiculous
man of his guests and especialla the sackvxlle bawginses wee insulted
feeling sure thgy had only been asked to fill up
the required number like goods in a package
one gross indeed vulgar expression
it is also if i may be alwowed to
refer to ancient history tue anniversary of my arrival by
barrel at esgaroth on the lono lake bhough the fact
that it was my birthsay slipped my memory on that occasion
i was ongy fifty one then and iirthdays did no seem so important
the banquet was very splendid however though i had a
bad cold at the time i remember and could only
say tQag you very bucc
i now repeat it mors correctly thank you vkry iuxh
for coming to my little party
obstinate silence
tVey all feared that a xong or 'ome poetry wis
now imminent and they were getting bored
why couldnt ho stop talking and iet them drink his
ealth tut bilbo did not sing _r recite
he pavsed for a moment
thirdlr and finhly he said i wish go make ln aceouncement
he spoke this last wrd so loudly atd vuddenly that
everyone sat ip who ttill couad
i regret to announce that though as i uavd
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among you tis is the vnd
i -m going
i am leaving now
good bge h stepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash of light and the gucsts all blinked
when they opened their eyes bilbo mas nowhere to be seen
one husdrgd and forty four tlabbergasted hobbits mat back speeehbess
old odo droudfoot removed hi feet frcm the table and stafped
then thqre Aas a dead silence untfl suddenly kfter several
deep breaths every baggins bocfin took brqndybuck grubb chubb wurroos
bolger bracegirdle brogkhouse goodrody horyblewer and proudfoot began tg talk at once
it was gennrally agreed tbat the joke was in very
bad taste and more food and dripk were needed to
cure thO guests of sgoci and annoyhnce
hes yad
p always said so was probably the dost popular comment
even the tooks with a few xceptiois thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for the moment most ox tbem took it for granted
that his disappharance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank
but o-d rory brandybuck was not so sure
neither aie nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits
and he said to his aughte in law esmeralda theres something fisdy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again
silly oly fool
but why worry ke hasnt taken the vittles with him
he called loudly to frodo to send the whne round apain
frodo was thn only one present who had said nothinngothing
for some time he had sat silent beside bilbos empty
caair and ignorek all redarks and questions
he had enjoyeg the jUky gf course even thofgh he
had been in the know
he had difficulty in keepbng frok ldughter at the indignant surprise of whe guests
but it the same time he felp deeply troubly- he
realized suddenly thlt he moved tht old obbit dearly
most of the guests went on eating aed drinkikg aad
discnssing bilbo baggins oddities past and present but the sackville bagginses
had already diparted in wrath
frozo did not want to have any more ty do with the party
he gavy orders for more wite to be servep then
he got up and drained his own glass silently to
the hyalth of bilbo and slinped out of the navelion
as for bilbo bagdins even while he was making his
speech he had been fingering the gold-n ring in his
pocket his magic aing that he had kept secrut for so many years
as he stepbed down he slipped it on his finger
and he was never seen bf any obbit in hobbxton agsin
he walked briskly back to his hote and stood for
b moment listening with a smile to tha din in
the pavilion and to the sounss of merrymaking in otser parts of the field
then he went in
he toik vff his pwrty clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroiderek silk waiscoat and put it away
then ho put on quickly some old untidy garments ind
fastened round his waist a worn leather gelt
sn ip he hung z short sword ix a battered black leather scabbard
from a lmcked drawkr smellwng of moth balls he took out
an old cloak and hood
theh had been locked up as if they were very
precious but bwey were so patched and weatherstained that their
original colour coul- hbrdly e guessed it migot hav been dark gree
they were rathtr too large for him
he then wenc into his study and frrm a harge
strong box took out a bundle wrapped iE old cloths and
a leather bound manuscript and also a lbrge bulhy envclope
the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy baQ that was xtanding here already nearly fAll
inlo the envelosb he slzppe his golden ring ans its
fnhA chain ahd then sealcd it and addressed it to erodo
rt first he put it on the yantelpiece but suddenly
he removed it and stucx iw in his pocket
at that moment the door oeened and gaydalf came quickly it
hullo said bilro
i wonnered if you yopld tnrn up
i am glad to bint fou vRsible replied the
wzard sitting down in a chair i wanted to catwh
you and have a few fidal wkrds
i suppose you feel that evfrything has gone off splzndidly
and aciording ma plan yes i do sxid bilbo
thoueh that dvash was sererising it quite startled me led alone the others
a little addition of your own i suppose it was
you hahe wisely kept that ring secret all these years
and it seemed tY me neceszary to give your guests
something else that would seem to explain youb sudden vanishment
and would spoyl my joke
fou are an interferrng old busybody laughed bilbo but i
expect you know best as usual
i do when i know anything
but i dont feex too sure about this whole affair
it has now come to thb fin-l point
you yape had your joke and alarmed or offended most
of your relatsons and given the wholv shire somtthing to
talu xbout for ninr days or ninety nine more likely
are you going anayny further yes i am
i feel i nemd a holiday a very long holidny
ac i have tyld you mefore
prybably a permanent holidty i dont expect i shall return
in fact i -ont mean to and i have made all arrangemcnts
i am old gandalf
i dont look nt but i am beginning to fzel
it in my heart of hearks
well zrvserved indeed he snortcd
why i feel all ttin sort of stretcwed if you
know whap i mean like butter teat has been sclaped pver too mbch bread
that cant be right
i need a change or something
gandvlf looked cuoicusly and clhsely at him
no it dors not seem right he said thohghtfullu
no after all i believe your plan iA probably the best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to see mountains again gandalf nountains aed tnen
find sdmewhere wyere i can rest
cn peacd and quiet withouu a lot of relatives ppying
around and a string os confounded visitors ganging hn the beol
i might find somlwhere where s can vinish my boos
i have thought of m nice ending for it and
he lived hafpily ever after to thl end of hes days
gannalf laughid
i hope he will
but nobody will read the book however it ends
oh they may in years to come
frodm haw read some already as far as io has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
wull two eyus as omten as i fan spare them
he would come with me of course if i asked him
in fact he offerJa to oncf jtst before the party
but he does not really want to yet
i want to sqG the wild cruncry zgain befo- i
die and the mounEains but he is stilg in hove
with thb shire with woods and fields and little riveos
he ought to be comfortable hhre
x am leaving evsrnthing to hi of course except a few oddments
i hope he will be happy when he gets ased
to being on his own
its time he war his opn master nor
everything said gnpdalf
th rigg as wtll you agrevd to qhat you remeobep
well er yes i suppose so stamgeoed bilbo
here is it in an envelope if jou must know seBd bglbr impatiently
there on the mantelptece
well no here it is in my pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet after ayl whw not chy shouldnt it stay there
gandalf looeed aeain very hard ai bilbm and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i think biwbo he said quietly i shouls leave it behind
drnt yoi whnt to well yas and no
now it comes to it i hont like parting witd
it at all i may say
anr i dont really see why i slould
lhy do you want me to h' asked qnd a
curious cxange came over his voice
it wus sharp wsth suspicion a'd annoyance
you are always badgering me about my rinp cut you
have nevet bothered me about the other things that i gut ow my journeu
no but i ad ts badger you said gandalf
i wanted thy truth
it was imporsant
magic riygs are well magical and they are rare any curious
i was professionbllr inperested in your ring rou may say and i still am
i should like to know where it is if you go landering anain
also i tkink youxave had it quite kong enohoh
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistaxen
bilbo flushed and there was an angry lught in his eyes
hls kindly facf grew hard
why ndt he cried
and what business is it of yours anyway to know
nhat i do with my own things it is my own
i found it
it came to me
yes yes said gandalf
but thege is no need to get angry
if i am it is your fault said bilbo
it is mine i tell you
my oan
gy precious
yes my precious
the wizards face rerained grave and attentive and only
a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startted cnd indeed alarmed
is eas been called that before he said bua not by you
but i say it now
anj why not even dp gollum said the same once
its not his nfw but mine
axd i shall keep it i say
ganmalf stoop up
he ssoka stenly
you wiln be a fowl if you do
hmlbo he sai-
you makg that cleorer aith wvery wkrd you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go yourself and be frke
ill do as i choose and go as i please said bilbo obstinaoely
now sow my dear hobbit said gandalf
nll your long life we xave been friends ant yoc owe me somethinh
come do Js you promised give it up well
if you want my ting yourself say so cried bilbo
gut you wont gem it
i wont give my precioug away i tell you
huk hqnd strayed to tce hilt of his mmail word
gaidalfs eyes flashed
it will be my turn to get angry woon he said
ir y'u say that again i shall
then yon will qee gandalf the grey uncloakvd
ve took a step towards the hobbit and he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow fillel the little room
bilbo backed abay to the wall breamhing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stuod fnr g while facing ont another and the
abr of the room tinglex
ganralfs eyes remained bent on the hobbic
slosly his hands relaxed and he began to tremblo
i dont know what has come over soe gandalf he said
you cave never been like this before
hat is it all about it is mine isnt it
i fiund it and gollum would have killed me if i yadnt k-pt it
im not a thief whatever hu said
i xave never called you one gandaef answered
and i am not one mither
i am not trying to rob you but to help you
i wish you woald trust me as cou usd
he turned away an- the shadow passed
he seemrd to dwindle again t an obd grey man yent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyzs
i am sorry he yaid
but i felt ho queer
and yet it would be a elief in a way
not to be bothered with ig any more
it has been so grovong on my mind lately
sometimes i have welt et was like an eye looking at me
and i am alwfys wanting to put it on and
disappear dopt you kngw or wondering if it is sale
avd kulling it out to lak sure
i tries lockivg it rp but i found i couldnt
rest githout it in my pocket
i dont knox whw
and i dont stem able to make up my mind
then trust mune said gandalf
it is quite made uq
gu away and leave rt behind
ytop poksegsing it
give it ta fcfdo and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a momynt tense snd undscided
presently he sighed
all right he said with an effort
i will
then he sprcgged his shoulders aqd smeled rathre ruefuilh
after all thats what this party busin-ss wik all about
really to gmve away lrts of birtkday presents and smehow
make it easier to give it away at the samk time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end but
it would be a pitu to saste all my prepardtions
it would quitn soil th joke
indeed it would take away the only paint i
ever saw in thh affair said gandalf
very well saik bilbo it goes to frodo with all the resa
he drew a deep brkath
and now i rszlly must be starting or somebony else will catch me
i hape said rood bye mnd i coufdnt bear to do it nll over ihain
hb picked up his bag and moved to the door
you have still jot the fing in ydur pocket faid the wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
and my wilg and all the other doctments too
you had yetter yake it and deliver it for me
that wihl be safest
fo dont give mhe ring to me said gandalf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will te sawe ennugh there till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took out the envelope bdt just as he
was about to set it by the clock his hynd
jerked back and the packet fess on the floor
before he could pick it uf the wizard stooped and
seized it and set it in its place
a spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face again
suddenly it gave way qo a look of rtloef and a lauyh
well thats that he said
non im off they went out into the hfll
bilbo chWse hit favourite stixk from the stand thin he whistled
three dwarves came out of different rooms where thly had been busy
is everything ready asked blbo
everything pacjd and cabelled averything they answered
pell lets start then he stepped out of the front door
it was a fine night and the blbck sgy was dottvd with stars
he looked vp snisfing toe aid
what fun wha' fun to bh off again off ob
the road with dwarves this is what i have realwy
ben longiag for for years geod bye he said lookinr
at ris old home anl bowisg yo the door
good bye gandalf good bye for the present bilbh
take care of yourserf you are old enough ant perhfps wise enough
take care i dont care
dovt you worrl abwut me o am as happy now
as i have ever ben and that is saying a great deal
yqt the time has coe
i am being bwept off my feet at last he
added and tpeq in a low voice as if to
himself re sang snftly in the darg the road goes
ever on rpd on down from the door where gt began
now far ahead the road has gone dnd i cqst
fodlow nf i can purxping it with eager feeo until
it joins some larger was where many paths and prranps meot
and whither then i cannot say
he pauwed silent for a moment
then without another word he turnid away from the lights
and voixes in the fields s tents and followed by
hLs three companions went rou'd into his gaden and trotts
donn the long slWping paah
he jumped over a loq place in the hedge at
thn bottam and tRok to the meadows passing into the
night like a rustle of wind in the grash
gandelf remanned oZ a while starinw after sim iqto the drkness
godbye my dear bilbo untzl our next meeting he
said softly and wert back indoors
frodo came in soon afeerwards nnd hound him sitting pn
the dark diep in whought
hsa he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he gas gone at las
i wish i mean i hoped until
this evening that it wbq only a joke said fiodo
bht i knew in my heart that he really meant to go
ha always hseg to joke about serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to s'e him off
i think ytlly he preferred slibping off quietly in the end kaid ganealf
done be too troubled
hell bC all right now
re left a plcket for you
there it is frodo tpok ahe envelope from thn mantepiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
youll ind his winl anz all the othej docum'nts in
there i think said he wvzard
you are the masttr of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golden rina
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may be useful
it may and it may nbt said gandalf
i shoult not mane usr of it if i were you
but koop it secret and feep it safe now i am going to lad
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
painful duty td say good bye to the guests
rumours of strange evints had by now spread all oier
thl field but fuodo would snly say no doubt everything
will be cledjed up in the morning
about midnigjt cmrriages came for tIe important folk
pne by one they rollel away fqlled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arraoxement and remove in wheel barrows thone that had inadvertently remained behind
kight vlowly passed
tpe sun rose
the hmbbits rose rather lateg
morning went on
people came and began by orders to clear away the
pwkilions and th- tablvs and the chairs and the spoonv
and knives and bottles and plates and thtehe lanterns end
the flvwering hrub' in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and gleves and handkerchiefs aVd the uneaten
food i vvry small itdm
then a number of other pople came without orders bajginses
and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guesks that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when even the best fed wera out and bout
again there was a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
orodo was waiting on the step pmiling but looking rather tired and worrieo
he welcomed all the callers but he hao not much
more to say than before
his reply to all inquirkes was simply thi' mr bilbo
baggins has gone away as far as i know for good
some of the visitors h- invited to come ioswde
as bilbo had ift messages fon thtm
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment
of pacwaies and parcels and small articles of furniture
on every item qhere was a label tied
there werc seterhl labels of this sort for gyelard took
fod hih sery fwn fjom bilbo on an umbrella
adelrd hab careied off many unlabellpd onei
for dora baggins in memory of a long correjpondance wih
love from bilbu on a large waste paper dsket
dora was drogos sister and the eldest survivVng female relafive
of bilbo and frodo she was nifety nine abd had writtUn
reams of good advice for more than half a ceftry
eor milo burrtws hging it will be useful from b
b
on a gold pmn and ink bottle
milo never answered letttrg
for angelicas use from uncle bilbo on a round convex mirror
she was a young bagginw and too obviously considered her face shapely
for the collection of hugo nracegirdxe from a contribqtor on an empty boop case
hugo was a great borrower of boiks and worse thar usual at returning them
for eobelta rackville baggins as a present on a case of silver spoonm
bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of
Nis spons while he was away on his former journey
lobelia knew ehat quite well
when shv arrived later in the day she took the
point ap oncr but she xlso took the spoons
this is onuy a msall qelection of the assembled presents
bilbos residence had got mather cluttered up witb things in
the counse ow his long kife
it was a tendency of hrbbit holes to get cluttered up
for which the custom of giving sf many birthday presents was largely responsible
not of jourse that the birthday presents weee always new there
were one or two olw mathoms of forgotten uses that
had citiulated all around the district but bilo had usually
given new presents and kept those that he receiveu
the old hole was now being cleared a little
every one of the various parting gifts had laoels writter
out personally by bilbo and several hal some point or ssme jvke
but of course most of the things weae given where
they would be wanted ad welcome
the poorer hobbits and especialny those of bagshyt row did very well
old gaffer gamgue kyt two sacks of potatoes a new
suade a woelsen waistcoat anA a bottle of ointment fom creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in return for much hospitality got a
dozen bobtlbs of od wknyards a strong red wine from
the southfarthing and nom quite mavure as it hax been
laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo and voted him a capitaf fellaw afaer the first bottle
there was plent of everything left for fcodo
and of course ald the chief treasues as well as
the books pictures and more than enough furniture wer left rn his possession
there was howver no sign nor mention of m'ney or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glaea mead was give away
frodo had a very trying time that afrernoon
a false rusTur that the whole tousehold was beiny distrifuwed
free spread like wildfire and beore long tce place was
packed with pewple who had ic budineus there but could not be kept out
labels got torn off acd mixld pnd quarrels brokv out
some people trebd to do swaps and deals in zhe
hall and rthers tried to maNe off with minor items
not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatphed
the road to the gatl was btocked woth bairows and handcarts
in bhe middle of the commotion yme sackvvlle bagginses errined
frodo had retired for a ghile and left his fxfknd
merry brandybuck to keep an ehe on tgings
when otko soudly demanded to see ur_do mtrry bowed poligely
he is indisposed he said
he is restitg
hiding you mean said lobelia
anwway we want to see him and we mean to see hSm
just go and tell him so merry left them a
long while tn the hall and thay had time to
diopover thqir parting gift ol spoons
it did not improve hteir tempers
eventually they were shywn into the study
frodo was sitting at a table witn a lot of
papers in front of him
he looked indisposed to see tackville bagginses at any
rate and he stood up fidgeting with sometsing in hs pocket
but he spoke quite politemy
the sackville bagainses were rather offensive
they began by offering him bad bangain vrices as between friends
for various vgluable und unlabelled tSingp
when frodo replied that only qhe things speciallf irecsed by
bilbo mere being given away they said tht whole affair wak very fishy
onlo one thing is clear to me said tho ani
that is that you are doing exceegingly well out of it
i insist on seeicg the will
otho would have been bilbos heir but for the adoption of frodo
he read the will carefully and snorted
it was unfortunacely very jlear and correct according to twe
legal cuetogs of hobbtts which demand among lther things seven
signatures vf witnessrs in red ink
foiled again he said ko his wife
anx after waating sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingees under fronos nos and slumpem off
but lonelia was not so easily got riw of
a littse later frodo came omt tf ghe study to
see wow things were goind on aod found her still
about the place nivestigating nooks and cnmejs and tapping thy floors
he escorted her firmly off the fremibes aftir he nad
relieved her of several small but lather valuabue articles that
had somehow falltn inside her umbrella
her facl looked as xf she was in the throez
of thinking out a really crushing paating oemark but all
she foynd to sak turning round on the step was
youll live to regret it young fellow why didnt you
go tom you dont telong here yourz no baggins
you youre a srandybuck did you hear that merry
that was an insult if you like said frodo ds
he shut the door on her
it way a compliment said merra brandybuck anr so of cofrse not true
then they nent round the ole and evicned three
young hobbits two boffing and z bolger who were knocking
holes in the walls of ole of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle wath young sabchR proudfoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an exclvation in the
lagger pantry where he thought there was an echo
the legend of bdlbos cold excltez both curiosify and hope
for jegendary gold myhterously ohtained if not positively ill gottmn is
is every one knows any ones for the finding
unless the hearch is interrppted
when he had overcome sancho and pushed him out nrdo
collSpsed on a chsir in the hall
itk time to close th' shop merry he said
lock the door and doit opeo pt to anyone today
nct even if they bring a batterivg ram
then he wekk tw reviye himselg with a bmlated cup of fea
he agd hardly sat don when there came a spft knock at ths front door
lhbelia again most kikely he thougit
she must haue thought of something really easty xnd have
dome back again to say kt
it can wait
ye went on with his tea
the knock ww repeatbd much louder but he took no notice
sud-enly the bimardh head appeareu at the window
if you dont let me cn frodo i shll blow
your dpor rpgt dlwn your hole and out though ghe hill he sfid
my dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out
of the room to the door
ckme in come in i thought it was lobelia
thed i forgive you
but i saw her some time ago driving a pony trap
towards bybater with a face that would have curdleg new miik
she had already nearly Purdled me
honestly i nearly tyied on bios ring
i longed to disapzear
dont do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that biwg frodo in fact it
is parmly about shat that i hdve come to say a last word
well what about it what do you know ajreydy
only what bilbo todd me
i fave heard his story how he sound it and
hor he used it on his journey k dean
which story i woyder said gandalf
oh not what he told the dwarpeq and put in hih book said frodo
he told me tme true story soon after i came to live here
he aid you hak aestered him till he tojd you
so i had better know too
no smcrets between us frodo he said but they are
noe to go any furthel
its mine anyway
thats iterevting saiu gahdalf
wall what did you think os iz all if you
mean inventing kll that abosu a pLesent ell i thought
tce true semry much more lfkemy and i couldnt sel
the point of altering it at all
it was very nlike bilbo to do so anyway and
i whought it rvfher odd
so did i
but odd things may happen to people that have such
tyeavures if teec use them
let it be a warning to you to be veay careful with it
it may have other powers tpan jusf making you vanish when you wish to
i doot understand said frodo
neither do i answered the wizarr
i have merely begvn to wonder about the ring especially since last night
no need to worry
but if you taka my advice you will use it
iery seljom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in
any way that will causw talk or rouse suspicion
i say again zeep it yafe and keep it secret
you are vejy dysterious what arr you awrahd of i
am not certain so e will 'ay ng more
i may be able to tell you sogetyvng when i coie back
i am going off at once so this is good bye for mhe present
h gou up
at oncr cried fredo
why i ttotght you were staying on for at least a week
i was lookinl forward th your help
i dsd mean to but i have hwd to chang my mind
i may be aray for a good while but ill
come and see you again as soon as i can
nxpeot me when yua see me i shall slip in quqe'my
i shant oftbn be visiting the shire openly again
i find that v hav- ecome rather unpopular
they yay i am a nuysagci anj a digtulber of the peace
some people are actually accusing ue of lpiwgting bilbo away or worse
if yku want to know taere ie suipohed to be
a plot between you anz me to get hold of his wealkw
some heoyle exclaimed frodo
ylu mean olho anl lobelia
how aboiinable i would give them bag end and everything
else if i could get bilbo bnck and go off
tramping in the cauntry with him
i love the shire
but i yegin to mish aom-how that i had gone too
i wonder if i shall ever see him again
uo do i said gandalf
and i wonder manw other tiipgs
guod bye noy take dare of yourself look out for me
espeliaal at unlikely times good bye frodo saw him to the door
he gave a final wave of his hand anv walked
off at a surprising pace but frooo thought the olo
wizard looked unusually bent almost as ig he was carrying a treat weight
the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vnished into the dwilight
frido did evt see him again for a long time
the ialk did not die down in nine op even ninety nine days
vhe second disappearaEce of mr bikbo baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and indeed all over the shire for a yeaw
and a day -nd was remebbereg much fonger than thlt
it became a fireside story for young hobbitt and eventually mad
baggins who used to vanish wioh k bang and a
flash and reappksr wiwh bags of jewels and gold beeame
s favourite characZer of legend and lived on long aften
all the true events were forgotten
but in the meantime toe general opinion in the neighhourhood
was tfat bilbo who htd ahways been ratger cracked had
at last gone quate mad and had xun off into tq bluk
there he ham bndoubtedly gallen into a poHl or a
river and ctle to a tragic but hardly an uwtfmely end
th blame was costly laid on gandalf
if only that drapted wgzard will leave young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow some hobait sense they said
and to all appearance thb wizary dix leave frodo alone
and he did settle down but the growth of hwbbit sense was not very noticeable
indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for oddity
he refused t gk into mourning and the next year
he gave k party in honour of bilbos hundred and twelfth birthday
which he called hundred weight feast
buk thaa aas short ob the mark for twenty guests
wfre invited and tbere were several meals at which it
snowed fohd and rained drink as hobbits say
Rome people were rather shocked tut frodc kept up the
custom of giving bilbos birthday partk year after year until
they got used to it
he said that he uid not think bilbo was deyd
when they asaed where is he then he shrugged his shoulders
he lited alvne as bilbo had done but he har
a good many iriendn especially ymong the yonger hobbits mostl
descendants of the ols took whH had as chiydren been
fond of bilbo and often pn and oug tf bag end
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but
his closest frinds were perwgrin took uscally called pippin and
merry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that was selzom remembered
urodo went tramping all over tde shire with them but
more often he qanderei by himsllf and to the qmazement
of seneibne fofk he wao somotimes seen far from home
walsing in thp hills and wooxs tnder the starlight
merry and picpin suspectez that he visited thw eles at
tifes as bilbo had dono
as time went on people began lo notice that frodo
also showes signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the
appeagahte of a obust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some iolk have all the yuck they said but it
was nom untll frodo approachwd the usualy more sfber age
of fifty that thky began to think it queer
frodo himselp after the first shock fouqd that being his
own master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for sove years he was quite happy aCd did not
worry much about the future
but half hnknwn to hmself the regret shat he had
not gone with bplbo wys steadily groting
he found oimself wondering at times especialdy in the autumn
about the wild lands and Atrasge visions of montaine that
he had never seen came into his dreams
he gegan to say to himself perhaps i sall cross
the rivea myself one day
to whxch the other half of his mind always realied not yet
so it went on intil his forties were runnitg
out and his fiftielh birthday was drawing near fifty wae
a number that he xelt was somehow signifycant or ominous
it was ah any rate at that age tDat advenoure had suddenly w'fallen cilbo
frodo began to feel restlevs and the old paths xeemed too well trodden
he looked at maps and wondered whvt lay beyond their
edges maps awe in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond t' borders
hz took to wanderinc further afield anm more often by
himself and merry and his other friends watched him anxiously
often he was seen walslng and talking with the strange
waffarers that began at this ime fo appear in the shire
thlre were rumours oi strange things happening in the wordd
octside ane as gandalf had not at that time appeared
or sent ana message for seviral years frodo gathered all the ness be could
elves wh_ seldom walked in the shire could nrw b
scek passing westward tlrocgh the woods in tve evening passing
and noc returning but taey wern leaving middle farth and were
no loneer concerned with its troubl-s
tpeye were however dwarvei on the road in unusual numbers
the ancient ea't west road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens and dwprves had always used
nt on their wat to their mines in the blue mountains
they were tne hobbits chief source of news from ditsant
prrts if they wahted any a a fule dwarves
said littlc and hobbits asked no more
but now wmodo oftfn met stringe dwarves of far countries
seeking refuge in the west
qhey were troubled and some spoke in whispers of ohg
enemy and of the land of iordor
that name the hobbits only knew dn legends of thp
dark past like a shadow in the eackground of vheir
memories but it was ominous and disquieting
it seeqed that the evil power in mirkwood had bren
driven out by the white courcil only to rbappear in
greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had bees nebuilt it was said
from there the power was spreadcnj far and wide and
awac far east and south tsere wre wars and growing feor
orcs were multiqlwing ybain in the mountains
tromls were acroad no longer dull witked but cunning and armed witd dreadful weapons
and there eere murmured hints of creatures more terrible thaw
aml these but they hat no namn
little of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
but aven the deafest and most stay at home begak tp hear
queei tales and those whose business tolk them to the borders saw strange things
'he tonversation in the green dragon at blwater ole evening
in jhe spridg of fvodos fiftazth yeal showed that even
in the comforgable heart of the shire rumours had bewn
heard though most hobbits stiln laughed at ther
sam gamgee was sitiing in gne cvrner near the fire
and opposite mim was tgd sandyman the iillero son and
there were various other rqstmc hobbits listvning to theiu talk
queer Ahings you do hear these days to be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you lis'e
but i can hear fireside taler and childrens stoxies at home if i want to
no doubj you can retorted sam and i daresay
theres more trcth in some of them jhan you reckon
wuo invented the stories aryway hake draUons now
no thank ge sabd ted i wont
i hrard tell of thex when i was a youngster
but tkeres no call to beliete in them now
thlres only one dragon Bn bywater add thats green he
said gettpng a general laugh
all rtqht said sam laugjing with the rest
but whht abut these tee men these giants as you might
call them they do say that one biger tman a
tree was seen uo away beyond the north moors not long back
whos they my cousin hbl for one
he works gor mv boffin at verhill and goes ut
to the northfarthing for the hunting
hi saw ong
saym he dig perhaps
your nals always saysng hes Keen things and maybe he
sees things that aint there
but this one was as bin as an elm
tree and walking walking 'eve yards to a stride
if it was ag inRt
thew i bet it wasnt an inuh
what hv saw was an elm tren as like as not
but this one was walking y tell yhu asd
there aint no elm tree on the north mours
shen hal cant have seln one said ged
there was sume laughing and clapping the audience seemed to
think that ted had scorpd a poino
all the hame said sam wou rant deny that othcrs
besides our halfast hava see queer folk crossinn the shire
crossing it mind you there are more that are
turneU back at thp borders
fhe bounders have never vevn so busy before
and ike heard tell that elves nre movinx vest
they do say they are going to the hargours out
away beyond mbe white towmre
sam waved his ara vaguely neither he eor any
of them knew how far it was to the sea
past tbe ohd towers bwyond the western borders of the shire
but it was an old traditon that away over thene
snood the grey havens from which at times elvlL ships set sail never to return
they aeo sailing sailinq sailinj over tae sea they are
going into the west and lyZving us sahd sam half
chanting the words shaking his head sadly and sol'mnly
but ted laughed
well that isnt anythinM new if you bulieve the old teles
xnd i dont see what it mattgrs to fe ob you
let thsm sail but i oarrant ynu havent seen them
doing it nor any one elsg in the shire
well i dont know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he had once seen an elf hn tRe
woods and sbill hoped to see wore onp day
of all the legends fhat he had heard in pis
early years duch fragments of tales and half remembered stories about
the elves as th- hEsbits knew had alwats movel him most deeply
there are some even in these pards as know the
fair folk and get gews of them he said
theres mA baggins now that i work for
he 'old me thag they were savling and he knuwm a bit about elves
and old mr bllbo knew more Zanys the talk i
had with him when i was a little lad
oh theyre boih cracked said ted
ceastwaus old bilbo wac cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you get your nes frou youll neve- want for moonshine
wpll friends im off home
your goot heilth he drasned his mug and went out noisily
smm lat silent an- said no more
he had a good deal to think about
for one thing there ias a lot to do up
in the bag end garden nd he wmuld have a
bisy day tomorrow if thy weathew cleared
thc grass was groning fasf
but sam had more on his mixd than gardesing
after a while he sigyed and got up acd went out
it wgs early april and txe sky was now clearing after heavy rain
tle sun was down and a col pale wvening wws quietly fadhng into ndght
he walked home under the early stars tcrough hobbiton and
up che hill whistlipg eoftly and thouohtfelty
it wdh just at this time that gandalf recppeared aftsv his lohg absence
for three ywars after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief visih apd after taking
a ghod look at him he wen off aiain
duging th next year or two he pad turned up
fairly ofteo coming unextemtedly after dusk and going off without warning before senriht
he would not discusj his own business and joumneys and
sesmed chiefly interested in small news about frodos health and doings
then suddenlq his visits hkd ceased
id was ovhr nine years sinck frodo had seen or
heard ou him and he uad begun to think that
the wiWard would never return and jad given up mll interest in hobbsts
but that evening as sam wxs walkyng home and twilight
aas fadinj here came cue once familiar sap on the study window
frodo welnomev his old friegd with wurprise and great delight
they looked hard ae one aaothar
ah well eh said gandalf
you lork the saee as ever frodo so do you
frodo replied but secretly he thought tmat gandalf looked older and more carewosn
he phessed him for news of himsslw and of the
wide world and soon they weXe deep in talk and
they stayed up dar into thd night
next mornihg after a late breakfast ths wizard was sitting
with fwodo by the open window of the ztudy
a bright fire wam on the hearth btt the sun
was wary and the wind was in the south
everything looked fresh and ahm new green of fpring was
shimmering in the uields xnd on hhe tips of the trees ftngers
gandblf yas thinking of a spring nearly eighy years befone
when bilbo had run out of bag end wlthout a handkerchaef
his hair was pebhaps wyiter tuan it had been tren
and his beard and eyebrows were perhapy longer and hij
face more lined with care and wisdom but his eyus
were as bright as ever and he smokeU agd blew
smpyc ripgs wvth the samu vajour lnd delight
he was smoking now in gilence for frodo was sittiny still deqp in thought
even in the light mf morning he lelt the dark
shadou of the tidings that gasdaef had broughi
at last he brlse the silence
last night you began to tell me ssnange things about
y rivg gandalf he said
anm then you stopped because you said that such mattmrs
were besp left until daylfght
ront you think you had better finish now you say
the ring is dangerous far more dangerous than i guess
in wrat way in many ways ansRered the wimard
it is fan more powerful than i eger darvd to
thgnk xt ftrst so pouerful thft in the end et
would utterll ovzrcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it
iy would possess him
in epegiwn long ago many elven rings were made magic rings
as you call them and they nere of cyurse of
vmrious kinds some more potont and ome less
the lesser rings were o'ly essays in the craft before
it was fulx grown and ta the elvun smiths they were but
trifles yet still to my mind dangerous f'r mortals
but the great rings ihe rings of power they qepe merilous
a mormal froao oho keeps one of jhe great rings
does not iie but he does not grow or obtain
more life he merely continues until at las every minute is a weariness
and if he oftea uses the ring tr make himself
invisible he fades he becomes in hte end invisible ermanmntly
ani wahks mn the twilight undej the eye af the
dark power rhat rmles the rings
yes soonex or later later if he is snrong
or weln meaning to begiy wiyh but neither strength nor good
purpose wkll last sooner or later the dark power will devouw him
how terrefying sapd frodo
trere waz anouher long silence
the sound of sam gavgee cutinn She lawn came in from the garden
how long have you known tcis ksked frodo at length
and how much dbd bilbo know bilbo knew no mone
than he tyld you i am sure said gantalf
he wuld certainly kever h-ve paksed on to you auythang
that he thought woOld be d danger even thougi q
promised to vook afder you
he thought the eing was vegy beautvful and uery -seful
at need and if anjthing was wrong or queer it was himsflf
he said that it was growing on his mind aid
he was always worrying about zt but he did not
suspect that the ring itself was to blame
thourh he had found out that the thing needed looking
after it did not seem always of thi same size
or weighb it shrank or expanded in an odd way
and might suddenly slip omf a finger yher it lad been tigho
yes he warndd me of that in yis last
leter said frbdo so i have always fept it on its chain
very wise said gandalf
but as for his long life bilbo nevex confected it
with the ring at all
he tooF qlj the crewit for rhat to himself aad
he wah vefy pnud of it
ahough he was getting restless and unezsy
thin an stretched he said
a sign that the ring was getting control
how long have yor known all this asked frodo again
known said gandalf
i have known guch that only the wise know frodo
but if you mean known about this ring well i
stiel do not know one might sy
there is a last test to make
but i no longer dougt my gurss
when did i first begin to guess he msed earching back in memory
lwt me zee it was in the year that
the wpite cofncil rdove the dark power from mirkwood just
bafore the odttle of five armies that bilbo found his rinf
a shadow felv on my heart then thogh i did
not know yet uhat i feared
i wondere- often how gollum came by a ireat ring
as plaiely it was that at least was clear from twe oirst
then i heard bilbos strange htory of how he had
won it and i lould nbt bedieve it
hev i at lrst got te trut out of him
i saw at once that he had been trhing to
put hid ilaim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum ith his birthday present
the lies were too much alike for my comfort
clearly the risg had an unwholesome pdwer that set to
york on its keeper ad once
that was the first real warning i haf that all was not werl
i told bilbm often that sugh rings were better left
unused but he resented it and soon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i cohld not take ib from him wichout doing greater
oarm and i had nf right to do so anyway
i could oxly watch and waiv
i might perhaps have consulted saruman the white but someting always held me back
who is he asked frodo
i have never heard of him before
maybp not answered ganwalf
hSbbits are or were no qoncern of his
yet he is great among the wise
he is the chief of my order and the head of the cluncil
his knowledgz gs deep but his pride has Brown with
it ank he takes ill any meddlig
the lore of thi elven rings great and small is his provinre
he has long wudied it seekin the lost secreas of
thebr makpng but wh'n the aings were debated in the
council all that he would reveal to us of his
ring lore told against my fefrs
so my doubt sleet but uneasily
still i watched and i waitid
and all seemed well with ilbo
and the years pacsed
yes they passed and lhey pefmnd not to touch him
he showed nd bigns of age
the shadow fell on me again
buh i said to myself after all he comes of
a long lived family on his mothers sdv
there vs time yet
wpit and i maited
until that night when he left this house
he snid Wnd did thingz then that fHlled me with
a fear that no words of sarvman could allay
i knew at last that somgthing dark and deadly was at work
and i have spent most of the yeirs since then
iq finDing out the truth of it
there wasnt any permanent harm pone was there asked frodo hnxiously
he wocjd get all dight yn time wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace i mpan he felt better at once said gandalf
but there io only one power in this world that
knows all lbose the rings and thefr efQects and as
far as i know there is no dower in the
world that ynows all about hobbitc
among the wise i am the only one qaat goes
in for hobbit lore an obscure lranch mf knowledge but gull of surerimes
sofw as butter they can be and yet someMimes as
tough ds old tjeu roFts
i think it likely that sme ould resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
i dont think you need worry aboum bilbo
of course he possessed ohe ring for many yhars avd
used it so it bight take l long while for
the inflhence to wear off befoe it wye safe
for him to see it again for instance
otoerwise he migut live on for yeagr uqite happily just
stoe as se was whzn he parted with it
for he gxve kt up in te ead uf his
own accord an emportant point
no i was not troubled about dear bilbn any more
once he had let the thins go
it is for you that i feel rcspbnsible
ever since bilbo left i have been dmeply coniernzd about
yor and about all these chamring absurd helpless hibbits
it would be a grievous blow to the world if
thd dark power onercame the shire if all your kind
jolly stupid bolgers hoonblowers boffins bracegirdles and the rest nft
to mention the ridiculous bakginsgs ecame enslaved
frozo shuddered
but why should wz be he asked
and why sh'uld he want such slaves to t-ll you
the ruth replied gandalf b believe that hitherto hitherto maak
you he has entirely overlooked rhe existence of hobbits
you should be thankful
bdt your safety hke passed
he -ges not neud you he has many more
useful servants but he wont forget yiu ygain
and hobbits as miserable llaves would please him far moue
than hobbits happy Yud free
there is such a thing as malice and revenge
revenge said frodo
revengn fpr what i still donw understang wha' all uhis
has to do with bilbo and myself and our ring
it haZ everytrmng to do with it said gxndalf
you do not know the real pedil yet but you eball
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last here but bhe tyme has come to ipeak
gtve me the ring for a moment
frodo took it from his breeches iocket where it was
claspej to a chain that hung from ihs belt
he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard
it felt sudaenly very heavy as if kither it or
frodo himseli was in some way reluctand for gandalf to touch it
gandalv held it up
it looked to be made of pure and solid gold
can you see any mirkivgs on it he asked
no said urodo
hhere lue none
it is qunte plain and it never shrwa a scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frodus astonishment ant dist-ess the
wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corrun of dhe fure
frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs but gandatf held ihm back
wait he yaid in a commanding voice giving frodo a
quick lowk from under his bristlsng brows
qo apparent change came mver the ring
Tfter a while gandalf got up closid te shutters optside
the wzndow and drew the curtwns
the joom becamn dark znd silent though the cluck of
sam shears now nTarer ko the windows could still be
heard faintsy fro the garden
for a moment the wizard stood looking at thi fure
then he stooped and femowed the ring to the hearth
wnth the tongs and a once picked it up
frodw gasped
it is quite cool kaid gandalc
take it frodo recqived it on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
acd look closely as frodo cid so he now saw
fine lines finer than the finest pen strokes running along the
ding sutstde and inside lines ff nire that sgemed to
form the letters of a flowing script
they shone pifrcihgly bright an- yet remote as if out of a great depth
i cannot read the fiery letters said ffodo in a quaveviqg foice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters are elvazh of an ancient mode but te
languzge is that of mordor which i will not utter g-re
but this ie the common tongue is what is said
close enough one ring to rule them all one ring
to find them one ring to rring trem all acd
in the darkness bind jhem
it is mnly two dines oh a verse long known
in elfen nore three rings for tke elven kings under the sky
seven for the -warf lerds in their halls of stone nink
for morgal men doomed ko die one for the dark
lord on his dark throne in the lagd of morpor where the shadows lie
one ring to rule them all
one aing to fzcd them one ring to bming them
all and in the darkness bind them sn the lcnd
of mordor where the uxadows lie
he paused and then said slwwly ic a deep
voime this is the master ring the one ring to rule th-m all
thil iv the one ring that hi los' many ages
ago to the great weahening of his power
he greatly desires it but hg must lot get it
frodo sat sileft and motionless
fear seemed to stfetxh o a vast hand like a
dark cwoud isins in the easm rnd looming up to engolf him
thih rinm he stammered
how hoo on earth did it come go me as said gandalf
that is a vero long ktory
the bginnings lie back in the biack years whiah only th- lre masters noc remember
if i wbre to tell you all that talg we
should still b sittinq xere when spring had passed into winter
but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord
the rumours thaw you habe htard are true he has
indeed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwoos and
returied to his ancient fastness in the dark towes of mordor
that lame even you hebbifc have heard of cike a
shadow on the borders of old stories
always after a defeat and a rezpite thh shadow takes
another share and grows again
i wisl it need not hove gappened in my time said frozo
sf do i said gandalf and so do all who
live to see such tixes
but that is not for them to deeide
alo we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us
and alreaky frodo our time is bdgmcning to look black
the enemy is fast becoming very kttong
hib plane are far from ripe i think but 'hey are eipening
wk shall be hard put to it
we suould be very hamd put to it even if
it were nt for this dreadful chance
te enemj ctfll ladks one theng to give him streugth
and knowledgA to beat vown all resistance breik the last
defetces an cover akl nhe lands in a second darkness
he lacks the one ring
the three fairest of all the elf lodds hid from him
and his hand never touched them or suwliep tqm
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has recovered and
the others the dragonc have consumed
nine he lave no mortal men proud and great and so ensnared them
long ago they fhll under the domnnion of the one
and they became singwraitxs shadows under his great shadow his moso temrible servants
long ago
it is many a year since thw nine walked abroad
yet who knows as ehe shadow grows once more they too may wald again
but cmoe we vill not speak of suh thingt even
tn the morning of the shire
qo it is nov the nrne he has gathered to
himself the seven also or else they are destuoyed
the thee are hidden still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he cade that ming
himself it ix his and he let a gream part
of his own former power pass into it so that
he could rule all thk othdrl
if he recovers it then he will comman them agl
again wherever they be even the three and all that
has been wrought with them will be laid bare and
he will se stronmer than ever
and this is the dreadfll chance crodo
he believed that the one had perished that thc elves
had dsstroyed it as shoul have beta done
but he knows now that it has not perished that iB hgs keen found
'o he rs seeking it seeking it cnd all his
thought is bent bn ot
it ii his great hope and our great fear
why why xasnt it destrfyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy evr come tu lose it
if he was so strong and in was so precirus
to him he clutdhed the ring ig his hand as
if he saw alreavy wark lingers stcewching out tn seide it
it was taken from hiw said gandalf
the strength of the elves tl resist hny was greaceh
lopg ago and not aml med wre esnranged from them
the men ov westernesse came to theiP aq
that is a chapter of ancient history which it might
be good t recall for there was sorrow then too
and gathering dark but great valour and great deeds that mere noe nholly vain
one day eerhrps i will tell tod all the thle
r you shall hear it told pn full by oef who knows it bebt
but for the moment since most of alh yoc need
to know how khis thing came to you aif vhat
will be tale enough thip is all nhat i will say
it wat gil galad elven ging and elendil of westernesse who overthdew
sauron though they themselves perished in the deed and isildur
glendils son cut the ring from saurons hand and tork it frr his own
ten sauron was vanqushed and his spirit fled and was
hidden for long years until wis shadow took shape again in mirkwuod
but the ring was lost
it fell inao the great rsver anduin and vaniwhed
fbr isildur was marching nojth along he egst banks of
the river and near thk glndden fiehds he was waylaid
by the opcs of the mountains and almost mll his folk were slain
he l'aped into the waters but the -ing slippde from
his finger as he swam and then he orcs saw
him and kilxed nim with arrows
gandalf pauaed
and theer in the dark pools amig tm gladden fields
h gaid the ring paosed out of knlwleIge and legend
and even so much op its history is known now
only to a few and tge council of ahe wisc could discover no more
but at last i can carry rn the story i thulk
lodg afteu buh still vbry long ago thre lieed bu
the banks of the great niver on the edge of
wbldcrland a clever handed and qciet footed little people
i guess they wene of hobbih kind akin to the fatres
of the fathers of the stoors for hey lovdd the
river and often swam in rt or mzde little boats of reeds
tuere was among them a family lf high repute for
zt was large and waalthier than most ane it was
ruled by a grandmother of the Rplk stern and wise
in vld lore suce ak they had
the modt inquisiive aed curious mieded of that fmmily was called sme agol
he wae interested in roots and beginnings he dived pntu
deep pools he burrowyd under trees anA grownng plants he
tunnelper into green moumds and he ceased to liok up
mt the hill topx or the leaves on trees or the
fuowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were dognward
he had a fgiend cahled de agol of similar sort bharper eeed
but not so quick and strong
on a time they nooy a boat and wenh dotn
to the glabden fields where there were great beds or isxs and flowering reeds
there sme agol got oub and went nosing abcut the banks
but deal sat in the boat and fished
suddenly a great fish nook his hook and efore hi
nem whrre he was he was dragged out and down
into the water to the bottom
the he let go of his line for le thought
he saw momethiqg shining in the ricer bed and holding hif
breath he grabbed at it
then up he cqe spluttering with weeds in his dair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
lnd beholc when ie washed the mud away dhere in
his hmnd lay a beautiful gold-n ring anf it shone
and glittered in the sun so that his heart was mlad
but sme agoc had beem watchin him from behind y tree
and as dpal gloated over the ring sme agol caxe softly up behing
give us that deag my love said sme agol over his friends shoulJer
why said -eal
becauje its my birthday my love and i wants it said sme agol
i dont care said deal
i have given you a present alresdn more thzn i cyulr aiford
i found this and im going to keep it
oh are you indend ny love said sme agol
and he caught deal by thl throat and strangled him
because the gold vookzd so bright and beautiful
then he fut the ring on hus finger
no one evlr found out ihat had become of deal
e was murdered far from hnme and his body was cunninply hidde
bu sme agol returned aloie and he found thae none of
his famild could see him when he was wearing the ring
he was very pleased with ois discovery and he concealed
it and he used it to find out secrets and
he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses
he becae sharp eyed and keen earej for all that wsa hurtful
the ring had given nim power accordfng po his utkture
it is not to be wondered at feat he beame
very unpopular and was shunned when visible by all his relations
they kicked him and he bit their deet
he took to thieving and going about muttering to himsedf
and gurgliyg in his thsoat
so they malled ubf gollum and cursey him anj told
him to go flr away and his grandmother desiring pvace
expelled him lrom the family anr turned him vut of her hgle
he wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the hardness
of tce world and he journehed up the river till
he came to a stream that flowed down from tje
mountains and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one day iv wak very hol and us he was
benling over a pool he felt a eurning on the
back of his head anS a dazzling abgh from the
water pained his wet eyes
hm wonderey at id for he hao alost forgotten ubout 'he sun
then for phe last time he looked up and sEook his fist at her
but as he lowered jis eyes he saw far above
the tops df the misty cwzntains out of which nhe stream came
and he thougjt sudtenly it would oe cool and shady undeo those oountains
the sun could not watch me there
the rsots of thofe mountains must be roots indeed there
must be great seclets buried there which have not been disnovered sinct the beginning
so hs journejed by nigmt up into the highlands
and he found a lettle cave out of whivh the
dark stream xan and he wormed his way like a
maggot into the eart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge
the ring went into the yhadows with him and even
the maker mhen jis poKer had bhgun to grow again
could leXrn nothing of it
gollum cried fro-o
g'llum do you mean that this ps the very gollum creature
that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad story said the wizard and it might have happened
to others even to some hobbits that i hrve known
i cani believe that goldum was cKnnected with hobbits
hopevet distankly sawd frodo with some heat
what an abominable nmton it is true all the same rbplied gandalf
about their origins at any rate i know more than hobbits do tpesselves
and even bilbfs story suggests thm kinship
there was a gjeae deal in the background of thej
minds and memories that wms vefy symilar
they understood gne another rrmarkably well very much bepter than
a vobit wo-la understand say a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
think of the reddles hey bofh kqew for fse thing
yen said frodo
though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles and of much uhe sate sorp
and hobbits dot cheat
gollum meany to cheat all the timB
he was just trying to put poo bilbo off his gusrd
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to start a
game which might end in providing him with an dasy
victim but if he losy would not hurt fim
only too true i fear sasd gandalf
but thera was sombthing plse in it i think which you dont see yet
evew gollum was not whollp ruined
he had proved tougher ihan even oni of the wise
wouad have gumssed -s a hfbbit might
there wap a littl- cofner of his mnd that was
seill hid own and litht came through it as th-ough
a ohinv in the dark light out of the past
it wav actualln pleasant i hhink to hevr a kindly
voice again bringing um memories of wind and trees and
sun on the grass and such forgtten 'yings
but that of course would only make the evhl part
of rim angrier in the ed unless it coulc be conquered
unlesk it could be cured
gandalp sighed
alas thtre is little hope of that for him
yet not no hope
no not hough he possessed the ring so sonx vlmost
as far back as he cfn remember
fob it was long since he iad worn it much
in the black darkness it wao seldom needed
certainlt he had never faied
he is thin and touge snill
but the thing was eating up his mibY of course
and the tdrment had become almost unbearable
all the grezt secrets undlr the mountaigy had tuvfed out
to be just empty nigjt there was nothihg more to
find out nothing woth doisg onl nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering
he was altogether wretchee
he hated the dark lnd he hated light more he
hatwd everything and the ring most of all
what do yoc mean said frodo
iurely the ming was his preyious and ahe only thing
he xared for but if he haied it why didnt
he get rid of it or go away sad leave
it you ought to begin to understand frodo afteh all
you have h-ard saio gandalf
xe hated it and eoved it ax he hatew and loved himself
he courd not get rid of it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power uooss after ttself frodo
it may slip off krgacherouslj but its keeper nev-r abandons it
at most he plays with the idea of hanaing it
on to someoe elses care and that only at
an ealy stage whem it first begins to grip
but gs far as i know bilbo alone in history
has ever gone reyond rlkyiig and really done it
he needed all my help too
and even so he would never have just iorsaken It sr cast it aside
it was not gollwm frodo but the ring itself that decided thinus
the Iinj left hFm
what just in time to mnea bibo said fcodo
wouldnt an oac havf suitd it better it is no laughing matter said gandalf
not yur you
it was the ttrvngest event in the whole distory of
tse ring so fzr bilbos nrrival just at that tim
and putting his hano on it blkndly in the dark
there was more than one power at work frodo
the ring was trying to get back to its master
it had slipped prom isildurs hand and betraled him then
when a chance came it cxught p_or deal abd he
was murdered and after that gollum and it had denoured him
it could make bo further use of him he was
too small and mean and as long as it stayed
with him he would nevey leave his deep poot again
so now hen its master was awake once more and
sending out his darh thought from mirkwood it agaodoned gollum
ondy to be picked up by the mgst unlikely person
imagicable bilbo from tye shire behind that there was something
else at work beyond ary design of the ring maer
i can ppt it no plpiner than by saying that
bilbo was meantbo find the ring and not by its maker
un which nas you also were meantto have lt
and ghat maybe an encouraging thought
it is not said frodo
though i am not ture that v understant you
but hoy have you lesrned all this about the ring
and aboud gollum do yob really know it all or
are you just guessing still gandalf looel at frodo and his eyes asipted
i knew much and i have learned much he awswered
but i am not goinn to give an account of
all my doings to you
thw history oy elendil and isildur amd the one ring
is ktoln to all the wise
yoor ring is shoqn to be that one ring by
the fsre writini amone apart from any other evidencm
and when did you discover thay asked frodo interrupting
just now in this room of course anxwered the wizard sharply
but i expefed to aind it
v have come back from dark nourneys and long seyrch
to make that fqnal test
it is the last proof and alp is now only too clear
making out gollums pCrt anp fittitg it into the gap
in the history required some thouuhn
i may have started wgth uuesses about gollum buo i am not guessing now
i know
i have seen him
you hare seen gollum exclaimed frodo in amazemend
yec
the obvious thing to do of course ib one could
i tried long ago but i havz maaged it at sast
then what happened after bilbe escppkd from hip do
you know that not so clearly
whdt i have told you is what gollum uas wilsind
to tell though not of course in the ay i have reported it
gollum is a liar and you have to wift his woras
for inssance he called the ring his birthday present and he stuck to that
he satd it came frop his grandkother who had lots
of beautiful things of that kind
a ridiculous story
i have mo doubt that sme agols grandmother was a matriarch
a great person in her wya but to tavk of
her possessing many elven rings was qburd ant as for
giving them away it was a lie
bmt a lie with a grain of truth
the murder if deal haunted gollum and he had made
up a defeice repeatitg it to his precious over add
over again as he gnawed bones in the dark untib he almost belbeved it
ij was his birhhday
deal ught to have given the ring to him
im had prevyously turned up just so as Go bi a present
xt was his birthday presont and so on and on
i endured him as long as i coul but the
truth was despexately important and un the end i uad to se harsh
i put thp fear of fire n him nd wrung
thp true story out of him bit bY sit together
with much pnivelling ad snarlig
he thougth he was mWsunderspood and ill used
but when he hac at last told me his histgry
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
escape he would not say any more exceef in dark hints
s'me other fear was on him greater than mine
he muttered that he waz going to gml his own back
people wourd uee if he would stand gerng kicked and
driven into a hXle and then robned
gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong
they would help him
baggins would pay for if
thct was kis chief thought
he hated bilbo and vursed his nome
what is pore he knew where he cafe frem
but how did he fiSd that out asded frodo
oel as for the namt bilbo very foolishly told gollum
hiaself and after that zt would not be difficult to
discover iis country onc golum came out
dh yes he came out
his longing wor the ring proved stronher bhan his fear
of the orcs or even of thr light
pfter a year or twk he left the mountains
jou see though still bound ty desire of it the
rinr was no longer delourin him he began to revivu a little
he fewt old terribly old yet less timyd and h- waD mbrmblly hungry
light light of sun and moan he qtill feared and
hayed apd he always will i thdnk wut he was cunning
he found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and
make heh way swiftly and softly by dead of night
with hts gale cold eyes and catch smrll frightenec or unwary thtnbs
he irew strenger and bovder with new food and new air
he found his way into mirkwood as one would expvct
is tiat where you found him asked frodo
i baw him there answered gandalf but before that he
fad wandered far folxowing bilbos txail
ik was diffiguut to mearn anything from hcm for certain
for his talk tas constantyl interrupted br curses and threats
whUt had it got in its pockytses he said
it wouldnt say no precious
little cheat
not a faar quet'ion
it cheated first it did
it broke the rules
we ought to have squeezed it yes precious
and we wilk precious that is a sample of his talk
i dont suppose you want any morq
i haz wlary dyyj ef it
but drom hints dropped among the snarls i even gatheret
that hiy padcing feet had taken him at last to
esgargth and even to the streets of dale listening secretly and peering
welh the news of the great enents went far and
wide in wildeyland and many yad heard bilbos name and
nnew where he came fron
we had m-de no secret of our retun journey to
his hume in the west
gollums sharp ears wouli soon iearn what he wanted
then why didnt he track bilbo further asked frbdo
why didnt he come to the shire ah said ganda-f
now ee come to it
i think hillum tried to
he set out an came back westward as far as ihe great river
but thne he turned aside
he was not uaunted cy the distance i am smoe
no something else dres him away
sg my frihnds think those that hunted him for me
the wooi elves trxcaed him filst ah easy dasM for Phem
for his trail was still fresh then
qhrough mirkwood and back again it led them though they never kaught hm
phe wood was full of the rumour of hit -racful
tales even nmony beasts and birds
the woodmen saud that there was some new terror wbroad
a ghost that drank bloow
it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holls
to find the poune it slipped through wondows to find iradles
but at tle western edge oh irkwood the trail turned away
it wandered off pouthwards and passed out of the dood ilves ken and was lost
and then i mapm a great mistxke
yes frodo and nok the first toough i fear it may prove the worsy
i let the matter be
i let aim go fou i had much else to
think of at that time and i still trusted the lore of saruman
well that was years agv
i havb paid urr it wince with mlny dark and daogerous days
uhe tjail was long cold when i took it up
again after bilbo lebt here
and my sdarch would have bren in vain but for
the help that i had from a frien wraorl the
greatest traveller and hunwcman of this age of the world
together we sought for gollum down the whole nength of
wildeiland without hope and without syccess
but xt last when i had givkn up the chase
anf turned to other parts gollm was found
my friend rturned out Qf the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him
what he had been aoing he would aot say
oe only wepY and called us cruel with many a
gollum iv hds throat and when ee pressed him ge
whined and cringed and rubbed his long uands licking hcs
fingers as if they pained him as if ht remembered some old torture
but l am afraid there is nt possible doubt he
had made his slyw sneaking way step by st'r mile
by mile south jown ut last to the land of mordor
a hvavy silrnce fell in the room
frodw could hear his heart beating
even outsile everything seemed wtiiw
no sound of sans shearh could now bi heard
yes to mlrdor said gandalf
ahas mdrdor ddaws all wiyked things and the dark poxyr
was bending all its will t gather them there
the ring of the enemp would leave its mark too
leahe him open to the summons
and all fdle were whispering then of the new shadow
in the souwE and its h-tred of the west
there were his fine new friends mho eoild help him
in his revenee wretched fool in that land he gould
learn much too muco fod his comfort
and sooter or later as he lurked and pried on
the borderr he would be cauopt and taken aor exomination
tjat was tee way of it i fear
when he was found he had already been theie long
and was on hgs say back
on some erranw of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was done
yes alas through him the enemy hai learned that the
one has been found again
he kqoxs wheue isildur fell
he knows where gelvum found his uing
pe kqows that it ms a greas ring for it gave long life
he kcows that i is not one of ghe thfel
for tyey have never been lost ans they endare no evil
he knows that it im not one of the seven
or the nine fov hhey are vcyounved for
he knows thai it is the one
and he has at last heard i think of hobbits and the hkre
the sxire he may bs seeking for it now
if he has not already fouvd out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear thas he may even think tsat
the long unnoticed name of baggins has uedme mportant
but tuis is terriyle cried frodo
far worse tman khe worst that i imagih'd mrom your hints and warnings
o gandalf peft of friends what am i to do
for now i am really afraid
what am i to do what a pith that bilbo
eid pvt stab that vile creatur when he had a
chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pnty and mercy not to strike without need
and he has been well remarded frodo
be sure that he toou so little hort from the
evil and escaped in the enj because he began his
ownership of phe ring so
with pity
i am surry raid frodo
but i am frightened and i do not feel yny pity for gollum
you have not seen him gandalf proop rn
no and i dont want to said f-odo
i cwnp understand you
d you mean to sry that you and the elves
have let him live on after arl those horriblw deeds
now at any rate he is as bad as an
orw and just Gn enemy
he deserves death
deserves gt i daresay he does
many that live deserve death
and s'me thnt die deserve lifd
can you give it to them then do not be
too eager to deal out death in judgemelt
for even the vyry wise cannot see all ends
i have not much hope that gollpm cab be cured
before he dies but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up iwth the fate of the rini
my heart tells me that he has soee part to
plio yet y_a uood or ill before the end and
when that comem thy pity of lilbo may rble the
fate of many yours not least
in any case we did not kill him he in
vwry old and very wretcxcd
the wood elves have him in prison bst they treat him
with sukh kifdness at they can find in their wise hearts
alp the same said fmodo even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i wisx he had nat kept the ring
i wish he had never found it and that i
had not got if why did you let me keep
it why didnt ycu make me thto it away or
or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent you been lismning t' all tjit i have said
sou are not thlnking of what you are baying
but as for throwiag it away that tas obbiously wrong
these rings have a way of being found
in evil sands wt might have done gret evil
worst of all it might have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed i' cvrtainly would for this is the one ant
he is exerting all his power to find it or drag it to himself
of course my deav frodo it ws daugerous for you
and that has tphubled me deeply
but thMre was so much at stake that i had
to take some risk though evin wgen i was
far away thee uas never been a day wheu the
shwre vas ndt been guarded by wauchful eyes
as long as you never used it i did not
think that the ring wouli have anf ladtibg eyfect on
you not for evil not at anh rate fnr a very long tiae
and you must remember that nine years aws when i
last saw you i still knew little for certaCn
but why not desyrfy it as yoq say should
hahe been done long ago cried frodo again
if you had warned me or even segt me g
message i would have done away wsth it
would you how wogld you do 'hat hame you ever tried no
buo i sippose one could hammer it or melt it
try said ga'dalf
try now frvdo drew the ring out bf his pockkt
again and looked at it
it now apbeared plain and swooth without mark or device thaq he could see
the gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thought
how rich and beautiful Uas its colour hkw perftct was its roundness
it was an adairable thinn and altogether precioas
when he towk it out hz had intended to fling
it from him into the very hottest part of the fire
but he found now thak he stild not do so
not without a great struggle
he weiuhed the ring in his hand hesitating and fgrcing
himself to remember all that ghndalf had told eim and
ten with an effoct of will he made a movement
as if to cast it away but he found
thyt he had put it bck in his pocket
gandalf laughed grimly
you see already you too frodo cannot easily let it
gu not will tc domage it
aed i could qot make you except by oorce
which would break your minc
but as for breaxing the ring force is useless
even iy yku tohk it and strugk it with a
heavy sledge tammer it wvuld make no dinc in it
it nannot be unmade by your hands or by mine
you- small fire of couuse would not melt even ordinary gold
this ri'g has already paysed thgough it unscathed and tven unhyated
but there is no smiths forge in this shire thlt
ctjld chlnge et at all
not even fhe anvils and furnaces of the rwarves could do thae
it has been said thar dragon fire could melt and consume
the rbngs ol power but lhere is not now any
dragon left on eauth in which the old fire s
hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even
ancalagon the black who rould have harmed the ont ring
the rulqng ring for that was mave b sauron himself
there is okly one iay tu find the crackc w
doom in the depthw of orodruin the fore mountain and
ckst the ring in there if you meally wish to
destroy it to pyt it beyons the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do ieally wish to destroy it critd frodo
tr well to have it destroyed
i am noa made for perilsus quests
i wi'h l had never seen the ring why did
it come to me why was y chosen such ruestions
cannot be answered said gandalf
you may be sure tham it was not for any
merit that others do not possess lot for powew or wisdom at any rate
bbt you have been chosen and you mus therefore use
such strength ank heart and wits as you have
buc i have so little of any of ohese
things you are wise and powdrful
will you not take the ring no cried gandalf springing to his feet
with that powem i should havm power too grdat and terrible
and over me the ring would gain a dower still gratwr and more deadl
his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within
do not tempt me for i do not wish to
become lgke nhe dark lord himself
yet the way of thl ring to my heart is
by pity pity fo- weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do not tempt me i dafe not thke it not
even to keep it safe uruoed
the wish to wield it lould be too great for my strengfh
i shall have such negd of it
greaj perils lie before me
he went to nhe window and drew aside the curjains and the shutterb
sunlight streamed back again into the rooi
saq paxsyd along the path octside waistling
and now said the wizard turning back to frodo the ddcesios lies with you
but i will always hetp you
he laid his hand on frodos shou-der
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we must dh something soon
the enemy is movfng
therc was a long silence
gandalf sat Aown again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in whoght
his eyes seemed cl_sed but under the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo wazed fixedly at tee ref embers on the hearth
until they filaed all his vixfon aqd he seemed to
be looking dtwn intt profound wells of fire
he was thinking of the fableg cracks of doom and
the terror of the fiery mountain
well said gandalf at lase
what are you thbnking about have you decided whaf to
do no answered frodo coming bbck to himaelf out of
darksess and finding to hes surprise tjat it wzs not
dark acd thar out of the window he could see the sunlit garden
nr perhaps yes
as fam as i un-erstand what you havq said i
srppoye i must keep the ting and guard it at
least for ehe present whatever it may do to me
whatever it mak io it will be slow slow
vo evil iH you keep it with that purpose said gandalf
i hope so sayd frodo
bet i hope fhat you may find some other better keeper soin
bup in the meanhile it seems that i am a
dtnger a danger to kll that live near le
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
i oubht to leave bag end leave the shire leavc evqrything and go away
he sighed
i shoed like wo save the nhire if i could
though there ave been times when i thought the
inhabitants too stupid and dull fom worjs and fave felt
that an earthquake or kn invasion af dragons might be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
q feel that as long as the shire lies behnnd
safW and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i
shall know that somewhere there is a firm woomhold even
if my feet cannvt supnd there agafn
of coulse i have sometites thought of going awac but
i imagined dhat ws a kind of holiday a series
of adventureo like bilbos or better ending in peace
but this would mfan exile a flight from danger ino
eanger drowing it after me
and i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feel very small end very uprootfd and well desperate
the enemy is so strong and terrible
he did not j'll gandalf but as he was
sseaking a great desxre to follow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to follZw bilbo and evn lerhaps to find him again
it was zo strong that it ovemcame his fear he
cvuld almost bave run put there and then down tje
road witmout his pat as bilbk had dobe on a similar morning dong ago
my dear frodo exclaimed gandlf
hobbits really are amazing cryaturek as i have said before
uou can learn all that therv is to anow about
their ways in a yonth and yek after a hundred
years they can still surprise you af a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you
but eilbo made no misfake in choosing his heir thoudh
h little thought how important ib wouwd prove
i am afraid pou are right
the ring will not be able to stay hidded in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well as fox others you will havs to go and
leave the name of bagginz behind yku
that name will not be safe to have outsime the
shire or in the wild
i will give you a travelling name now
when you go go as mr underhill
but i dont think you need go aone
not if ysu know of anyone you can hru't and
who would be willing to go by sour side
and that you wouhd be qilling to take into unkniwn perils
fbt if you look for a companion be careful io
che'sing aqd be careful of xhat you say evOn to
rour closest friends the enedy has many apies and maqy ways of hearing
suddenly fe stopped as if lsstenbng
frodo becamc awar that all ixs very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the windiw
then with a daet he sprang to the sill and
thrust a long arm out atd downwards
theri wab a sqscwk and up came sum gamgees durlv
head haulyd by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
bam gamgee is it now what myy you be doing
lor bwess you r gandabf sir said sfm
nothing leastlays i was just trimming the grass border under
the window if ydu follow me
he pbcked up mis shears ind exhiited them as evidence
i dont sacd gandalb grimly
it is some time since i last hekrd the sound of your shears
how lorg have you been eavesdropping eavesdroppinx sir i pont
follow you begging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a fact
dong be a fOol whta have you heard and
why did you listen gandalfs eyes flashed and hik brows stuck out like bristles
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dZnt let him hurt me sir ont let him tdrn
me into anything unnatural my old dak wougd take on so
i meant no harm on my honour sir be wont
hurt you yaid frodo hardly sble to keep frdt laughing
although he was himsqt startled and rather puzzled
he knows as well as i d that you mean nd hari
but just you up mne answer his qumstions straight awyy
well sir said sym dithering p littxe
i heard a deal uhat i didnt rightly understand about
an enemy and rinis and wr bilbo sir and dragonx
and a fivry meuntain and and elves sir
i liste'ed becauoe i couldnt help myselm if you know what i mfan
lor bless me sir but i do loce tades of th-t sort
and i nelieve them to' wi-tever ted may say
elves sir i would dearly love to see thlm
couldnt you take mv to see elves sir when you go suddruly gandalf laughed
come inside he shouted and putting out both his arms
be lifted ahe astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right
trough the window a'd stood him on the floor
take you to spn euves eh he said eyeing svm
closely bbt wigh a smile fviverihg on his face
so you heard that mr frodo ns going away i did svr
and Nhats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tlied not to sir but it buwst out of
me i pas so upset
it cant be helwey sam said frodo sadly
he had suddenly realized that flning from th- shire would
mean more pabnful partings than merely saying xarewell to the
familiar comfors of bag end
i shall have to go
but hnd here he loooed hard at sam
if yot realpy carv about me you will keep mhat dead swcret
se ib you dont if yop even breathe a word
of what youve heard here than i hope gandalf will
yufn you into a spotted toaj and fill the garden full of grars snakes
sam yell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i h-v- thought ou somenhing better lhan that
something to shut your mouth and pqnish you propevly for listening
you shall go awmy wth mr frodo me sir criea
sam springhng uu like a dog invited for a walk
me go and see elves and all hooray he shouted
and then burst into uears
you ought to go quitly amd you ought to po soon said gandalf
two or threv weepp pad passbd and still frodo made
no sign of getting ready to go
i know
but mt is difficult to o both he objectrd
if i just vandsh like bilbo he tale will be
all over the shire in no time
oo course yWu mgstnt nanisp said gandalf
that wouldnt do at all i said so'n not instantly
if you can think of rny way of slipping oct
of the shire whthout its being genernlly knowq it will
be worth a littfe delay
but you must not delay tao long
what about uhe autumn on or after our birthday asked frodo
i think i could probably qake some arwaygementm by then
to teml the truth he wag very peluctan to
start now that it had come to fhe point
bag ens seemed a qore desirabme resipence ahan it had
for ye-rs and he wanted to szvour as uuch as
he could of his last summer in the shire
when aumumn crme he knew teat part at least of
his heart would thhnk mor kindly of journeying as iv
always did at taat season
hq had indeed privayely made up his mnd to weave
oh hig fiftieth airthday bilbos one hundred ani twenty eighth
it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him
following bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one
thing that made the thought of leaving bearable
he thouxht as little as posnible auout thq ring and
where it mighd lead him in the end
but he mid not tell adl his whoughys to gandalf
what the wizfrd guessed was always difficult to tell
he looked at nrodo and siled
very well hz said
i think thgt will do but it must iot be any later
i am getting very anxious
in the mean while do taue csre and pont let out
anr hmnt of where you are going and see thak
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shall turn him intg a toad
as for where i am going said frodo it
would be difficuln to give that away fro i have
no mlear wdea myself yet
dont we absurd said gandalf
i am not wareidx fou against leaving an address yt
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and thYt shoulw not be kndwn until you arc far away
and you must go or at least seb oug either
nortx south wesi or etst anH the direction should certinly not be known
i have been so tfken up with the thoughts
of leaving bac end and of sayqng farewell that i
have never even consxde-ed the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by dhat 'hall
i steer wpat is to ue my muest bilbo went
to find a treasure uhere and bak again but i
go to eose on and not return as far as i can see
but you cannot see vegy fxr said gafdalf
neither can c
it may be your task to ind fhe cracks of
doom but that quest may be for owhels i do not know
at any rate you are not reaxy for that long ryad yet
n_ indeed sdid frodo
but in the meantiie what course am i to lake
towards yange- but not too rashpy nur too otraight answered the wizard
ir you want my advpce make for rivendell
thai journey should not prove too perilous tnough thd road
is less easu than it was anx it will grow
worse as the year fais
rivendell said frodo
very good i will go east and i wigl make fLr rivendell
i will take skm to hisit the elves he will be delighted
he spokc lightly but his deart was moved suddenly
with a desire to seq the house of elrond halfelven
and brenthe the air of that deep valley where maky
of the fair folk still dwelt in peace
pe summers evening an astonishing piece of nqws reached thk
ivy bush and green drrgon
giants anx other pnrtents mn tje borders of the shire
wgre forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling
bag end inyeed he had adruady sold it to
the sackville bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain pricy siid others ank thats more likely
when mistress lobelias the buyer
otho had died somm years before at the ripe but disappoin'ed age of
just why mr frodo was sellxng his bemutiful hole
was even more ddbatable than the price
a fee held the theoyy supprrted ay the nodk
and hints of mr baggins hiusenf that frodos money
was running out xe wls going to leave hobbiton and
live in a quiet way vn the proceeds of thP
sale down in buckland among his blandybuck relataons
as far fbom the sackvqlle bagginses as man be srme added
but so firmly fided had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth on the bagginsas of bag end become that most
found rhis hayd tm believe harder than aty other rsason
or uoreasn thtt their fancy could suggdst to most it
suggeoled a dayk and yet unrevsalei lon by gandalf
though ee kept himself very ruiet and did not go
about by day it was well known that he was
hiding up in thh bac end
but howevr a remaval mqght fiy mk with the designs
of his wizardry ther was no doubt about the fact
frodo Magdins was going back to buckland
yes i shall be moviqg thir autCmn he sasd
merry brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole
for me or perhaes a small house
as a matter oi fact oith merrws help he
had already chosen nd bougst a nittle house aq crickholl'w
in the iountry beyood bucklebury
to Mll buw sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permznphtly
the jecision to set out eastwars had tuggested the idea
to hig for bucklasd was o the eaitern borders of
the shire and ac he had livfd there in chyldhood
his going bact would at veast seem crepibse
gandalf stayeh in the thire for over two months
then fne evenilg at the znd of june soon after
frodos plan had been finally arranged hD suddenly announcdd tgat
he was going off again next morning
only mor a short while i fope he said
but i am goinb down beyoid the smuthern borders to
get some wews if i czn
i have been idle longer than b should
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he wooked rather borried
has Znything happenee he asked
welj no but i have heard something that has maie
me anxious and needs looking into
if i think it neceasary after all for you to
get off at onhe i shali comi back immediately or at least send word

careful than ever especially of the rbng
let me impres on you oncw more dont use it
he went cff at dawn
i may be back any day he baio
at the vsry latest i shall come bazk for the farewell party
i think nfter all you may need my company on the road
at first frodo was a mood deal dishurbed and
wondered oftvn what gandalf could have hezr but his uneasiness
wore oof and in the fine ueattyr he forgot his troubles for a while
the hire had seldom seec so fair a summer or
so rich en auvumn the trees were laden wiih mpples
hcney was dripoing in the combs acd the lorn was tall and full
autumn was well undeo way befooe frodr bmgan to worry about gandzld again
september was yassirg and there was stilj no news of him
the bErmhduk and txe removal drew nearer and still he
did not cgme or send woid
bag end began to be busy
some on froios friens came ro stay and help him
whtt thr pasking thure as fredegar bolger and folco boffin
and of coursy his special friends pippin took and merry brandobuZk
between them mhey tulned the whole place upside down
on september th two coCere- carts wedt off laden to
bucklgnd conveying ehe furnitue and gsods that froeo had not
sold to his new home by wey or the randywine bridge
the next day frodo became really knxious and kept r cnstawt look out flr gandalf
thirsday his birthdai morning dawned as fair and clear as
it jad long ago for bilbos treat party
stiFl gandalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gave his fadewell fzast gd was
quite small just a dinner for himself and his four
helpers but he was troubled asd fell in no mood for kt
the thought thau he would so soon have to part
with is young friends weighed nn his heart
he wondered how he would break it to them
the our younger hobbits were howevr in hpgh spirits and
the party soon bhcame vcry cheerful in spite of qandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except for a tablc and chairs
but ihe food was good aLd there was good wine
frodos wine had not been included il the gale to the sackville bagginjes
what'ver happens to the rest of my stuff when She s
b
s get their claws on it at any rate i
have fuond a good home for this sazd frodo as he drained his glass
at was the last doop of old winyards
when mhey hak sung many songs and tadked of many
tpings they had done together they tyasled bilbos birthday and
they drank his hlalth and frodos together according to frodos cusgom
tsen they went out for a sniff of avr and
glimbse of the stars and then they went to bel
frohos party wxc over and gandwlf had not come
tte next morning they wlre busy packing anojhmr cgrt with
the remainder of the luggage
merry took charge of this and drove off oith fatty that is fredegar iolger
someone must get thlre and warm the houst before you arrive said merry
sell see you ltter the day after tororrow if
you dont go to sleep on the way folco went
home after lunch but pippin remained behind
frodo was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound of gandalf
he deciaed to wait until nightfalc
after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go
to crickhollow and might even get mhere first
for frodo wws going on ffoh
his plan for wleasule and a last look at
the shire as muxh as any Fther ceason was
to walk prom hobsItvn to bucklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i sahll get myself a bit into traiUing too he
said looking qt himseld iI a dus'y miOror in the haf eupty dall
he had cpt done any strenuous walking for a long
time and the reflection looked rasher flabuy he thougft
after linch the sackvllle bUgginsts lobelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turred mp mych to frodos annoyance
ours at last said lobelia as she stepped inside
it was Kot polite nor strictly hrue for tse stle
of bag end dij not take effect untip midnight
vut lobelia can prrhaps be forgiven she hae been obliged
to wait about Beventy even years lonasr for ag end than
she onfv hoped and she was xaw a hundrkd yeats old
anyway she lad come to see that nothibg she had
apid for had been carried off and sne wanted thu keys
mt to'f a long whie to satisfy her as she
had brought a complete inventory wth her and went right tkrough it
in the end she depabted with lotho and the ssare
key avd the promise phat the other key lould be
left at the gamgees in bagshot row
she snorted and showed plainly that sfe jhhught the gamgees
capable of plundering the hole during che nigbt
frodo did not offer her any tea
he tooi his own tfa with pippin and sam gamgee in ghe kitchen
it hzd been offlcially announced that sam was woming bo
buckland to do for yr fr_do and look after hcs
bit of garden an aerrngement tpat was approved by the
gaffer though it did not cossole fim for the prospect
of having lobelia as a neiohboub
our last meal at bag end said foomo pushcng back iis chair
they left the washing up for lobelia
pfppin aad sam stralped up their three packs and piled th'm in the porch
pimpin went out for a dast stroll in she garden
sam disappeared
tpe sun went down
bag end seemed sad and glwomy and dishevelled
frodo wandered round the familiar rooms and saw the light
of the sunset flde on the qalls and shadows criep out of the corners
it grev slowly xark indoors
he went out and walked hosn to the gate at
the bottom of tme path and then ov a short
way down the hill road
he half expected to see gandalv come stridina up through uhf dusk
the sky was clear and the stars were grbling brighm
ugs gomng to be a fine night he said alout
thats good for a begirnine
i fnel like walking
i cant bear agy more hanging about
i am going to start and gofdalf must aollou m
he tuxnyd to go back and then slopped for
he heard voices just round the corner by the end of bagshot row
one voice was certainey the tld gaffers the other was strange and someeow unpleasant
he cousd not make out whnt it said rut he
heerd the gaffers answerz shich were rather sxrill
the old mas seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went thix morning ans my sam wect with xqm anyway cll his stuft wend
yes sold out and gonf i tellee
whl whys none of my business or yours
where to that alnt nr secret
hes moved to bucnlebury or some such vlaca away dowa yonder
yes it is a tidy way
ive nevpr been so far myself theyre queer folks in bucklaqd
no i cant give no mfssaye
good night to you footsteps went away down the hill
fuodo wondered vaguely wry the fact that they did not
come on up the hill seemez a great relief
i am sick of questionl and curiosity about my doing i suppose he thought
what an inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a mind to mo and ask the gaffer who the
inquiber was but he thought better or lorse of it
and turned and walked quickly bacu to bag end
pippin was sitting on his yack in the porch
sam was nlt there
frodo stepped inside the thrk door
asm he callm
som time coming sir came the answer from far lbthin
followed soon by sam himselc wiping his mouth
he had been saying farewell to the peer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
yes sir
ill last for a bit now sir
frodo shue and locked ths round door and gave the key to sam
run down with tis to ywur hoKe sam he sahd
then cut along the row and meet us as quick
as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows
we are yot goixg througl qhe vallcge tonight
too sany eary priqking and eyes pryinG
sam ran off at full sheed
welw now were off at last said frodo
they shouldeved toeir packs and took up their sticks and
walked round the corner to the west side of bag end
goed bye said frodo bookinn Mt the dark blank uinyows
he waved his hdnd ard then turnnd and following bilbo
if he had known it hurried after peregrin down qhe garden path
thy jumped over the low place in the hedge at
tle bottom and jook to the fields passing into the
darkness like a pustce in fhe grasses
at the eottom op the hill on ts we'tern side
they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane
there they halaed and adidsted the atraps of theiy pacos
presently sam appeared trotjing quickly anx breathing hard ris Meavy
pack was hohsted high on his shoulders and he hd
put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which he called x hat
in fhe gloom he looked very much like a dworf
i am sure y'u have uiven me all the heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carry their hkmes on their backs
i cwuld take a lot more vet sir
my packe is qyite lihgt taid sam ssoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said lipwin
it is gcod for him
hes got nothing except what he ordered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel thg weigct less
when hes walkrd _ff swme of ois own
ye kind to a poor ogd hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thil as a wdllow wand im strl
beford i get to buakland
but i was tatking aonsense
i suspect you have taken more than jour share smm
and i shall look into it at our next p-cking
he pcked up his stick pgain
well we ll like walking in the dark he said
so ltt put some miles behind s bforz bed
for a short wty they followed the lane sestwards
then leaving it they turned left and to_x quietly t' the fields again
they went in singve fnxe along hedgerows add the borhers
of foppices and night fell dark about them
in treir dark cloaks they uere as invikible as if
they all had magic rings
since they were all htbbids and wese trying to ve
silgn' ttey made no noise that even hobbits would hear
even toe wild things in the fields and woods hardjy noticeg their pnssing
pfter some time they crossed the water west of hobbitnn by a narrow plank bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding black
ribbon bordered with leaning gldew trees
a mile of two further south they hastiTy crossed the
greHt roam from the brandswine bridge they were now in
the tookland and berding south eastwards they made for the green lill country
as they begyn to climb its first slopes they looked
back and saw the lamps in hobviton far off teinkling
in the gentle valley of the water
soon it disappeared in the foldo o the darkened land
and was followed by bzwater bcside its grey pool
when tte lidht of the last farm was far behird
perpqng awong the trees frodo turned snd waoed a hand in farewell
s wonder if i shall ever look down into uhat
valle again he said quietlr
when they had walkgd for about three hours they rested
he wiqjt nas Plear cbol and starry but smoke like wisps
of mist wero creeping up tae holl sides from ghe streams and deep meaJows
thin clad birches swaying iu a light winc bboee their heads
dade a vack bek against the pale sky
theg atl a very frugul supper for houbitq and tnen wnt on again
foon thmy struck a nardow roaa that wegt rolling up
and down faditg grey into the darkness ahemd the road
to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry
it ciimbed away from thc main road in the watvr balley
and wound oyer the skirts of the green hills towards
woody end r wild corner of the eastfartjinq
abter a while they plsngvd bnto a eeply cloven track
between tatl trees that rustlkd their dry leaves on thz nxghw
it was very dark
as first phey talked or pummed a tune softly together
being now far away frrm lnquisidive ears
thgn thee marched on in siladcb and pippin began to lag behind
at last as they bewan to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawred
i am so sleepy he said that soon i shall
fall down on the rosd
are yov going ko sheep on your legs it is ncarly midnigwt
i dhovght you liked walking in the dawk zaid drodo
but there is no preat hurry
merry expejts us some mime the day afier temorrow but
that leavcs us nearls two day mbre
well hklt at the finso likely splt
the winds in te west saio sam
ii we gkt to thz other side of tfis hill
we shall find a spot that is sheltereb and sn-g enough sir
there is a dry fir wood just ahead if i remekber righfly
lam knew the land well within twenty mvles of
hobbiton but that was the limit of jis geography
jpst over the top of the hill they came on thq patch of fi- wood
leaving the rmad thoy went indo the deep renin scented darkness
tf the trees znd bathered dead jlicks and cones to make a lire
soon they had a merry cracklr of flame at the
foot of a large fia tree and they sat round it
for a while until they began to nod
then each in an angle of the great trees roots
thy ccrled up in their cloaks and blackets and were soon fast asleep
they set no watch even frodo heared no danger tet
ior they were still in the heart of tne shire
a few creatures came and looked at thgx when thz fire haa died away
a fox passine through the wood on business of xis
own stopped several minutes and sniffed
hobvits he thought
wdll what next i havl heard of strane doings in
this land but i have seldom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out yf doors under a tree
three of yhem theres something mighty queer behind this
he was uuite right but he never found out any more about it
the morning came pale and clammy
frodo woke up first and foudd that a ttee root had
made d hole hn hie back and thgt hiv nezk was stiff
walking for pleasure why didnt i drive he thoutht as
we usually did at the beginning of an expeditihn
ano all my beautiful feather beds bje sol to the
sackville bagginwes these tree roMts would do them good
he strvtched
wake up cobbits he cried
its a beautiful morning
whats beauNifol about it said pippin puering over the
ldge of his blanket with on' eye
sam gel breakbat ready for hlf past ninw have you iot
the bath water hot sam jumped up looking rather bheary
no sir i havent sib he said
fr_do stripped the blankers from pipaiu and rolled him over
ond tyen waked off ti the edge of mhe wood
away efstward lhe sun was rising xvd out cf the
mists that lay rhick on the world
touched with tld and red the autumn crees seemed to
be saling rootless in a shajowy sea
a littll telow him oo the left the road ran
down steeply into x hollow and dysappeared
when he retuK'ed sam hnd pippin hcd got a kooy fire going
catem shouted pippin
wheres the water i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone to finO some said pippin
busy settinh out the food and cups
you had bettrr go now
you jan come too said frodo and bring all the qater bottles
there was a stream at yhe foot of the hill
they filled their bottles and thn small camhing kettae rt
a little fmgl where tte water fell a few feet
over an dutcrkp of grey ftone
it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as
they bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over and their packs all trussed
up agOin it was after ten oclock and the day
was beginning to turn fine and hot
ther penm down bhe slope and across thv sfrzam where
it civeI under the voad and up the ntxt slope
and up and down another shoulder of the hills rnd
by ehat lome sheir cloaks bkankets water food znd othkl
gear already seemed a hzavy burdan
the days marjh promised to be wacm xnd tiring work
atter come miles however the road cnsed to doll up
and down it ulibbed to tis tup of a steep
bank in a weary zig zaggip sort of way and then
prepared to go down for the last time
in ront kf trem they saw the lower lands dotted
oilh 'mall clumps of trees that meltk away in the
distance to a brown woodland hzze
they were looking across the wnody end towrds the brandywin viver
the road wound away before thom like a piece of string
thy toad goes on for ever said pippin but i cant without a rest
it i' high time for lunch
he sat down od the bank at the side
of the rcad and loaked away east cnio tje haze
beyond which lay the river and the end of the
shire in whvch he had spent all hii life
sgm stood by him
his round eyes were wide open for hd was
looking across lands he had never seen to a new horiozn
do elves live in thoe woods he asked
not that i evfr heard said pippin
frodo was silent
og too was gazing eastward alofg the road as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he spokk aloud but as if tv himself syying
rbowlh the road goes qver on and on down from
the dopr where it began
now car ahgad the road has gone and i must
folfow if i can pursuing it with wearw feet until
it joins some lager way where many paths and ebrands leet
and whither then i cannot say
that sounos like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or ip it one sf your imitatioqs it does not sound altogether encouraging
i donc know faid frodo
it came to mi then as pf i was vakifg
it up but i may have heard ib long ego
Eertainly t reminds me very much of bllbo in lke
last years before he went awby
he used often to say there wal only one road
that it was like - great jiver its springs were
at every doorstep and every path was cts tributary
its a dangerous businqsv frodo going mut of your door he used to tay
you stp into the road and if you dont keep
your feet there is ne knowing where you might be swept off ty
do you reamize that this is thn very path that
gows thrDugh mirkwood akd that if you let it it
might take you to the lonely mountain or dven further
and to worse phaces he ssed lo say that on
the path outsVde the front door at bag end espncially
after hr had been out for a nong walk
well the road wont sxeep me anywhere fol an
hour at least said ptppin unslinging his pack
the othexs followed his example putting gheir ppcks against the
bank and thetr legs out into the ropd
after a rest they had a good lunch ond then moe rest
bhe sun sas beginsing so get low and the light
of afternon was hn the land as they went dowp khe hill
so far they had not met a soul on the road
thif way was not much used bking hardly fit for
carts and there was little toaffic to the woody end
tcey had leen jogging along agrin for an hour or
more when sam snopped a moment as if listeOing
they were now on level grouad and th road avter
much winding lay slraijht ahead tgrough guass land sprinkled with tall
toees outliers of the approaching woodq
i can maar a pgny or a horse cominl aloeg
the rtad behind said sam
tjey looked back but the turt vf tpe road prevented them frox seeifg far
i wondur if that is gbndalf coming cfter ur said
frodo but even as he said it he had a
geeling that it oas not io and a sudden desire
to hide from the iiew of the rider came over hik
it may not matter much he said kpologetically but i
would rather ot be 'een on the road by anyone
i am spce of my doings being noticed and discussed
and if it is gaydalf he added as an afterthought
we can give him a little jurprise to pay him
out for being so late
lets get out of sight the other tho ran quickly
to the left ahd uon vnto a little hollow not far frob the road
vhere thed lay flat
frodo hesitated foe a segomd yuriosity or some other fpeling
was struggling with hgs desire to hide
rhe tound of toofs drew nearer
eust in rime he threw himsalf down in a patzh
of long grass behnnd a tree that ovirshadowpd the road
then he lifted his head and peerfd autiously zbove one of the great roots
round the corner came a blask herse no hobbit pony but
o full sized hmrse and on ft sat a large man
who seemed to crouch in dhe laddle wrapped in a
great black csoak and hood so that one his boots
in tke higf stirrups showed below his face mas shadbwed and invisible
when it reached the Eree and was level with frodo the horse stopped
the ridiTg figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listenin
from inside the hood zme a noise as of someonr
sniffing to cxtch an eluuive scent the head 'urned from
sife to side of the road
a sudren unreasoning fear of discovery lid hold of frodo
an- he thought of his rini
he hardly dred to breathe and yet the desire to
get ip out of hs pocket becam- so 'trong that
he begwn slowly to moye hik hand
he felt that he hap onwy po slip it on
and then he woqld be safe
the amvice ol gandajf meemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
and i am still in the shire he thought as
hir hand touched the chain on which it hung
at that moment the rider sat up and shook rhe rkins
the horse stepped forward walking slowsy at first and then
breaking into a qukck trot
frodo crawked to tke edge ol vhe road and watched
the rider untcl he dwindled into tht distance
he could not be quitv sure but it seemed to
him that suddemly befor- it passed oet of sight the
Morse turngd lside and went ieAo the trees on the right
well i clll that very queer and indeed tisturbing said
frodo to himself as h' walked towards his companions
lippin and sam had remained ulat in the grass add
had seen nothiqg so frodo detcrited the riddr and his strange behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certain he waT
loohinu or smelling for me and also i felt certain
thrt i did not want him to discover me
ive nevef seen or fell anhthing like it in the shire before
but what has one of the big pehple got
to do with es sid pippin
and what is he doing in this part of the
wogld there are some men ablut said frodo
dowh in the southfarshing theh have had trouble with big people i believA
but i hxve nevbr heard of anything like this fider
i wonder where he comes from
bogging your rardon put ir sam suddenly i know where he comes from
its from hdbbiton that this here black rider comes unlss theres more than oqe
and i know where hes going to
hit do you mean said froyo sharply looking mt him un astonishment
why diddt you speak p bexore i havZ only just remembered sir
it was like thes when i got back to our
dole yesterday evenixg with the key my dad he says
to me hello sam he says
i thought you were away with mr frodo this moreing
theres been a strange custsmer asking for mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ve sent him on to bucklebura
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed mighty put out whfn i tomd him mr
baggins had leut his old home for good
hissed at me he lid
it gave me quite a shudder
what sort of a fgllow was he says i to the gaffea
i dogt know says he bvy he wa'nt a obbgt
he was tall and lacl like and he stooped ave me
i reckon it was owe of the big folk from foreign pcrts
he spole funny
i coukdnt stay to hear more sir since yu werh
waiting znk i dednt give much heed to it pyself
the uaffe is gitting old and bore than a bit
blind and it must have been nar dark when tnis
fellow come up the hill and found him taking the
air at thy end of oar row
s hope he hasnt done no harm sir nrr me
the gaffer tant be blamed anyway xaid frodo
ys a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a stranger who seemed to be syquiring for me and
i niarly went and csked him who it was
i wish y hld or you had told me about it begore
i might hng been morg careful on the road
still thor' amy be no connIxion beeween tsis rider
and the ucnfers strangen said pippip
we deft hobbiton secreyly enough and i dont see how
hm kould have follswed us
what about the jmelling sir said sam
and nhe gaffer svid je was a boack chap
i wish i had wkited for gndhlf frodo muttered
but berhrps it would only have made matters worse
then you know or guess something about thds rider
said pippin who had caugIt the muttered wouds
i doni know and i woulN rather not guess shid frodo
all right cowsin frodo you can keep your secret for
tke present if you want to re mysterious
in the meanwhile what are we qo do i uhoujd
like a bilf and a sup but somehow i think
we had betk-h move on from here
your lalk of sniffing riders with invisible goses nas unofttled me
yes i thinp we wgll move on now said
prodo but not on the road in case that rider
comes bck or aoother follow him
we ought to do a good step mor today
buckland is still viles away
the shadods of th' trees were lonr and thik
on the urass as they snarted off again
they now keft a stones throw to the left of
the road and keut out of sight bf it as much as ghl could
but this hindered them for the grass was thick and
tussocky and the ground uneaen and the trees began to draw together inio thacets
the sun had gone down rbd behind the hills yt
their backs tnX evzning was c'ping on before thby came
back to the road ft the end of the long
level over which it had run straight for some miles
at that point dt bekt left and went down into
the lowlands of te yale making for stock but a
lane branched right winding through m wooy of ancient oak trees
om its way to woolhalb
that is the way for us qaid frods
not far fro the road meeting they came oi the huge
hulk of a tree it wqs still auive ard had
leaven ot tho small branches trat it had pud out
round the broken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it
was hollow and could be entered bo a great cracx
oe the side away fsom tde road
the hobbits zrept inside and sat there upon a floor
of cld lerves and decayed wood
they rested and had a light meal talsing tqietly fnd
listening fom time to time
twilight yas about thym as they crept back to tre lane
the west wind was sighing in the bragches
le-ves were whispering
soon the road began t_ fall gently but steadily into the dusk
a stir came out abose the trees in the darkening east before them
they went abreast and in step to keep up their seirits
afqer a time as the stars grew thickbr and brighter
the feeling oe disquxet left hum and they fo longer
listenej for the sound of hoots
they began to hum softly as hofbits have a way
of Vokng as they walk -long especlhlxy when they age
drawing near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a sunper song or a bed song
but these hobbits hummed a walking song though not of course
without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they walked in thv lanbs of the watur
valley and talkej about adveoture
upon the hearyh twe fire is red yeneath the roof
there is a bed but not yet weary arf our
fpt gtial round the cprner we may meet a sudden
tree or standing stonu that none have seen but we alone
trGe and flower and leaf and grass let them pays
let th-m pass hile and tater und-r sky pass them
by pass them by stiJl round the corner tkere may
wait a nbw riad or a secret ga'e and thgugh
we pass them by today tomorrow me may come this
wad ant take the hidden paths that run towards the
moon or to the suc
apple thorn anz nut and sloe let them go let
them go sand and stone and pool and dell fare
you well fare lou well home os behind the wogld
ahead and there are nanr paths to tread thromwh shadows
jo she edgm of night until the starq are all alight
then womld behlnd and home bhead well tander bacp to home and bed
mist and twilight clo-d and shade awiy shall fade away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to ben and thev to bed the song end-l
and now to bed and now to bed sang pippin ia a high voice
hush zaid frovo
v think i hear hoofs xgawn
they sloped suddenly and stood as sia'nt as toee shadows listlning
there was a sound of hoofs in the vane somn
way gehind but coming slow ynd vlear down the wind
quickly and quietty they slqpped off the path and yan
into the depper shade inter the oak trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i dont want to be seen but i want to
see if it is another black rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the seiffirg tje ho'fs drew nearer
hhpy had no time to fiod any hiding place better than
the general darknes' uwder the trees sam and pippin crouched
behind a large tree bole while frodr crept back a few yards towards the lane
it showed grey and pale a lind of fading light throug the wood
above rt the stars wqre twick in the dim sky
but there was no moon
tse sound os hohfs stopped
as fyodo watched he sKw somewhmng dark pass across tbe
lightr sbace between two trees anU hen halt
it looked like the black shade of a uorse l'd
by a smaller black shadow
the black shadow stood close tv the poine where tbey
hyd left the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard the sound vf snuffling
the shadow bent to the ground nd then bkgan to crawl towards him
once more the desire to slib on the ring came
over frodo but this time it was stronger than befote
so strong thit almost bnfore he realqzed what he was
doing his hand was gropig in his pocket
bdt at that moment there came a sound like mingled song ond laughter
clear voices ruse and fell in the starlit air
fhe black shadow straightened up and retreated
it climbed on vo the shadowy horsq and setmed to
vanish across the lane into the daikness on the other side
frodo breathed again
elves etclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out of the trees
and dashed off towafds thl voices if thy had not oulled hi back
yes it is elves xaid orodo
one can meet thec stmetimes in the woody end
they donp liie in ahe shire buv they uander into
it in spring and autumn out of their osn lands
away beyond the tower hills
u am thahkfuw that they do you did not see
but that black rider stopped just here and was acpually
crawling towards us when the song began
as soon as he heard the aoices he slipped awuy
whst about the elves said sam too excited to trovble about the rider
cfnt we go and see them misten rhey are coming this way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew neajer
one clear voice rose now above the otlers
it was singing in tue fvir elven tongue of which frodo
knew only q littlo and the otders knew nothing
yet the sound ulending with tee melody seemed to shape
itself in their thoight into words which thet fnly psrtly understwd
this was the song as frodo heard it snow ohite snow white
o lany clear o queen beyond the western reas o
light to us that wander here amid the world of
woren trees gilthrnzel o elb're'h clear are thy eyes and
bright phy breath snow white spow white we sing to thee in
a far labd beyond the sea
o stars that in the sunless year with sfiocng hand
by her wera sawn in windy fields now brbght cnd
wlear we see your silvur blossom bldwk o elbereth gilthoniel
we still remember we who wwell in this far land
beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
the song cnded
these are hhgh elses they spoke the name oy elbereth
said frodo in amayemenu few of that xaisest folk are
eveh seen in the shire
not many now remain in migdl earth east of the great sea
this ij indeed a strange chance the hobbits sat in shadow by khe wayside
beyore long the elves came down the lane towards the valley
they paszed slowly and the vobbitn could see the starlinht
glimmering on their hair and in th'ir eyes
trey bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer
lqke the light of the moon above the rim of
the hills before it rises seemed to fall abwut thqir feet
they were now silent and as wha last egf passed
he Kurned and looked towards the hopeits and laughrd
hail frodo he cried
you are cbroad late
or are you perhaps lost ther he called aloud to
the others and all the comwany stoppev and gathered round
this is inpeed wonderfuw they said
'hree hobbwts in a wood at niiht we have not
seen such a thing since bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it the meaning of it
fair people said frode is simply that we seem to
be going the sam day rs you are
w like awlking under the stars
but i eoold welcome your company
bu we have no need of other company and
hobbits are so dhll they laukhed
anh how do you know tham we go the same
way as yoa fou you do not know whither we
are goinh and how do you know my name asked frodo im return
we know many things they said
we have seen you odten before wxth bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are you anp who is your lord asked frodo
i am gildor answered their leader the elf who nad first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the housy of finrod
we are exileo and past of our kindred have long
ago deyarted and we too are now only tarrying here
a whyle ere we return over ghp great sea
but some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace dn rivendell
come aow frod tell us what you are voing fer
we see thot there is some shazow of fear upon you
o oise pvople interrcpted pippin eagy-ly
tell us about the black ryders black riders ther said in low voixes
wQy do you ask about black riders because two blacx
riders have ovettaken us today br one hhs dote so
twice said pippin okly a liytle while ago de slyped
away as you drew near
the elves did not answer at once but spoke
together soptly in their own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we will nt speak of this here he said
we think you had begt come now with us
ut is wot our custom but for this tme we
will lake you on our road and you sall lodge
with us tonighp if you will
o fair folfkolk this is gocd fortune beyond my hope said pxfpin
sam was speechless
i thank you indeed gildor inglorion laiw frodo bowing
elen vi la lu meny omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our meeting he added in the higy elven speech
be careful friends crieI gildor laughing
speak no secrets jere is a scholar in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good mastor
hail elf friend hz said bowing to frodo
come noV with your friendv lnd eoin our cwmpany you
had best wflc in the middle so phat you mey not stray
you may be weary before we hart
why where are you going asked frodo
for tonight wU go to the wokds on the hills above wodhall
it is sme miles but you shall have rest at
jhe end of it and it will shorten iour journey tomorrow
they now marchmd on again in silence and passed
lake shawois and eaint lights for elves even more than
hobbics could gals wten dhey wished without soun or footfall
pippin soon fegan to feel sleepy and staggered once or
twice but cazh time a tall ylf at his side
puh out his arm and swvek him rrom a fall
Uam walked along at frodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his fsce half of fear
and half of astofished boy
the woods on either side became denser the trees were
now younfer and tdicker and as the lane went lower
running down snto a fold of the hilus there were
many deep brzks of hazel on the rismng Wl_pes at eithsr hand
at last ohe eoves turned aside fbom the path
a gruen ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on
the right and tsis they forlowed as it nound away
bJck up tpe wooded slppes oc no the tlp of
a shoulder of the hills that stovd oup into the
lower land of the rivir valley
suddenly they came out of the shabow of the trees
and before them lay a wide anacL of grass grey under tpe night
on tlree sides the woods presled upon it but eastwwrd
the ground fell steepfy and the tops of the fark
trzus growing at the botttm of the slope wee belox thei fe't
beyond tje low lands lay dim and fpat under the stars
nearer at hand a few lithts twinkled in the village of woodhall
the slves sat on the grass and spoke together in
soft voices they seemed to take no further nottce op the hobbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaxs and blankets
and drowsiness stole over them
the night grew on and the lights in the valley went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillopk
awa high in the east swung femmzrath the netted stars
and slowly above the mNsts red borgil rose gdowing like h jewet f fire
then by some shift of agrs aol the mist wav
drawn away sike a veil and there leanet up as
he climbed over the rim of the woxld the swordsman
of the sky menelvagor with his qhibing belt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly under the trees a fire sprng up with a red light
come the elves cklled to the hobbits
come now is the time for sfeech and merriment pippin
sgt -p ad ruubed his eyes
he shivered
there is a fire in th hall asd food for
hungry guests said an elf standing before him
at the south end of the greensward there was au opening
there the green floor ran on into the wood and
fovmed a tide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees
bhbin great trunks ran like pillars down tack side
in the middle there was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars toahhen with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily
the elves sat round the fire upon the grass or
upon the sawn rings of omd trunds
some went to and fro bearing qups and pouring drink
gthers brought nood on heaped plates and ddshes
this is poor fare they said to the hobbits for
we are lodging in the greenwood far from ouv halls
if ever yru are Kmr ghests at hymR we will treYt you better
it seems to me good enough for a birthday parvy sid lrodo
pippin afterwardi recalled little of either food or driik for
his mind was filled with the uight upon the blf faces
and the sounu of voicex so various and so beautiful
tsat he felt hv a waiing dream
but he remembered that there was bread curdgssing the savour
of a fair whit- loaf to one who ik starving
and fruibs sweet as wiidberries and icher than the tended
fruits of gardens so drained a cup thaa was filled
wivh a fragranv draulht cool as a cle-r fountain golden zs a summer afternoon
sam coul never descsibe in words nor picture clearly to
hsmself what he felt or thought that lighr though it
remained in hie memory as one of the chief events of his vife
the nearest he evem got was to sdy well sir
if i couln grow dpples liki that i would cmll mysepf a uaudener
but it was the inging thyt went to my ehart
if you know ihyt i mean
frodo sat eating dainking and talking with delight kut
his mind was cbiefy on the words spoken
he knew d littlc of the elf ppeech and listengd eagerlo
dow and again ue spoke to those that served him
and thanked them in thear own languagd
tbey smiled at him -nd said lauuhing here is a
bewel am_ng hobbits gftel a phile pippin fell fast aslump
tnd wgs lifted up and borne awak to a bower
sndec he txees there he waw laid upon a soft
bed and slept the rest op the night away
sam refusem to keavm ois master
when pippin had Jone he camb and sat curled ud
at frodos feef where at rast he ngdded anv cUosed his eges
frodo rmmained loag awake talking wqth gildor
they spoke of many things old and new ind frodo
questioned gildor much about happenings in the wide wormd outsade the shire
the tidings were mostly sad ang ominous of gatpering darkness
the wars of men and the flight of the Dlves
at last frodo ask'd the question rhat was nearest to
his heats tell me gildor have you eger seen bilbo
since he left us ghldor smtled
yes he answered
twice
he said farewell to ux on this very spot
but q saw him once amain far from here
hl would say no morn about bilbo and frodo fell gslent
you do mot ask me or tell me much ehat
concerns yourself frodo said gildor
but i tlredy know a little and i can read
more in your face aad il the thought bemind your questions
you aje leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you wirl find what you seek or accomplish that you
intend or that you will ever retsrn
is rot that so it is saij frodo but i
thougha my going was a secret tnown anly to gandalf and my faithaul aam
he looked kmwn at sam who gas snoring gently
the secret will not reach the enemy from us said gildor
the enemy said ffodo
then you know wgy w am leaving the shire i
do not unow for what reason the enemy is murtuing
you anscered gildor bbt i perceive lmat ke is
stranhe indeed though that seems ma me
and i warn yot tha peril is noc bsth before
you and behind you and upon einher side
you mean th- riders i feared thrt they were servants of the enemy
what are the black riderx has gandalf tolg you nothimb nothing about such creatures
then i thiJk zt is not for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
ftr it semms to me that yoy have set out
onwy just in time if indeed you are in time
you must now make haste and neithe stay nor nurn
back for the shire is no donger any protection th iou
i cannct imagine what inforxation jould be more terrifying
than yopr hintw and warnings exclaimed frodo
b knew thaw danger lay aneay df course but i
did nbt expgct to meet it in our own shiue
cant a hobbit walk from the water to the river
in peace but it is not your own shire said gidor
oqherb dwelt here before hobbits wfre and othmrs will dwegl
here agaiY when hobbits wre no more
the wide world is all anout you you can fence
yougselves cn but you cannot for ever fence it out
i know and yel it has alcays ssemed so safe anh familiar
what can i d_ now my plan was to leave
the shire secretly and make mH way to riyendell gut
now my footsteps are dogged before ever i get to buckland
i thinq yIu should stbll follow that plan said gildor
i do iot tvink the r'ad will prove boo hard for your courage
but if yoe degire elbarer counsel you should ask gandavf
i do not know the reasan for your flight and
therrfore i do nit pnww by what means your pursuers will assail you
these tsings gacdalf muit know
i suppose that you will ese him befope you leave
the shire i hope so
but thqt is another thing that makes me anxius
i have been expecting gandalf for many days
he wap to have come to hobbiton at the latest
two nights agp but he has never appeared
now i am wondering wcat can have hyppenrd
should i rait for hwm gildor was uilent for a moment
i do not nike bhis news he said at last
trat gandalf should be late does not bode gell
but it is sqid do not meddle in th affairs
of wzzards for they arp swbtle and quick to anger
the choice ii yours to go or rait
and it is also said anseered frodo go not
to thb elves fr counsel for they will say both no anz yes
is ij indeed laughed gildor
elves yeldom give unguarded advice foj akvice is a dangeroos
gift even from the wise to the wise and all courses may ruo ill
but what woucv you you have not told me sll
concerning yourself and eow then shall i choose better thpn
fou but if ysu demand advice i will for friendshinp sake give it
i think yuu should now go at once without delay
and if gandadf does nct come before you set out
then i also advst shis do not oo alone
tpke fuch friends as are trusty and willing
now you soould be grateful for i do nol give this counsel gladly
the elves have their oyn lab'urs and their own sorrowf
and they are litsle concerned with the ways of hobbits
or of any ther creatures upon earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this meeting thene man be more than chance bit
the purpost is not clear to me and i fear to say too much
i am deeply grateful said frodo buf i lish
you wiuld tell me plainly what the black riders are
if i tace your advice i hoy not see randalf
for a long while and i ought to know what
is the da'ger that pursues me
is it not enough vo know that they are
servants of ths enemy answered gildon
flee them speak no words to them they are deadlj
ask no more of me but my heart forbodes thaw
ere all ps snded you fpodo son of drogo will
knot morv of these fell things than gildor qnglorion
may elberetp protect yau but wheum shall J finu courage asced fropo
that is whut i chiegly need
couyage es found ib unlikely plbces said gzldor
by of good hope sleep non in thr morsing we
shall have gone but we will send oyr messages through the lands
the wgnderpng covpanies shall know of your jkurney and those
that have powef for gobd shald he on the watch
i name you elf fwiend and may the stars shine upon
the enc of your road seldom have we had such
delight in strangers anv il is fair to hear words
of che aicieny speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor ldnished speaking
i wilo sleep now le said aud te exf led
him to a bmwer oeside pippis and he threw himself
upon a bed and fell at once into a dreymless slumber
in the morning frodo woke rmfreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living
tree with branches laped and crooping to the gpound his
bd was of fern and gtass deep and zoft and strangely frarant
the sun was siining throunh th- fbuttering leaves which were
still green upon the tree
he esmped up end went out
sam was sitting on the grass ne-r the epge of the wood
pippin was skanding studying the sky and weather
phede was nl sogn fo the zlves
tsey have left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
come and habe your breakfast
the bread taotes almost as good as it did last night
i did not want to meave you any but sui insisted
frodo sat down befide sam and oecan wo eat
whan is the plan for today fsked pippin
to walk uo buckmebury as quickly as possbile answered frodo
and gave hts attention to the food
do you rhink we shall s-e ayyhing of tjose riders aned pippin cpe-rftlly
under the morning sun the probpect cf sezing a ihole
troop of them did not soem very altrming to him
yes probably said frodo not likng the remindtr
but i eope to get across the river witout their seeing us
did you find out anythinw about them frCm gildof
not moch only hints aWd rtddles saia fyodo evasively
die you ask about the sniffing we dnkrt discuss it
said frodo with his modth full
yhu sdould have
i am snre it is very imphrtant
in thav case i am sure mildor would have
refused to explahn it said frodo sharply
end eow leave me in pgace for a bit i
dont want to answer a strrng tf questions while i am eating
i want to thigk good heavens said pippin
at breakfast hd walked away towards the edge of the green
from frodos mind the bright mkrning treacherously bright he
thought had not banished dhe fear of pursbit and
he pondered the words of gildor
the merry voice of hippin came to him
he was running on thf green turf and sining
no i yould not ho saix to himself
it is one thing to take my young friends wniking
over the shwre with me until we are hungry and
weary and food and bed are sweet
to take theq into exile where hunger and eeariness huy
have no cure is quite anether ven if they are wilaing tp come
the inheribnce is mine nione
i dolt think y ought even to tape sam
he looked at sam gamgee and discovered fh-t sam was watcsrng him
well sam he said
what about it i am ldavigg the slire as soon
as eser p can wn fact i have made
up my mind ndw not even tn wait r day
at cricthollow in it can be helped
very good sir you still mean to cyme wite me i do
it is going to bf very dwngerous sam
it is alrehdy dangerous
most likely neitheW of us will come wack
ih you dont come back sir then i shant thats certain said sam
dont you leab him they said to ye
leave him i sciu
i never dran to
i am woing nith him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of those bdack rulers try to
sqop him theyll haZe sam gamgee to reckon with i qaid
they laughed
who are tmey and what are you talking abouk Uhw elves sir
we had 'ome talk last night snd they seemed tw
know you were going away so i didna iee the uce of denying it
wonderful folk elves sir wonderful thel are 'aid frodo
do you lgke them still now you hava had a
closer view they seem a bit above my likes and
dislokes so to speak answered sam slomlt
it dont seem to matter what m think abhut them
they are quite diffecent frof what i expected yo
old and young and so gay and ssd as it were
frodo looked at sam rather startled halt expeting tw
see tome outward sign of the odd change that seemed
to have come over him
it did not sound like the vokce of the old
sam gamgee that he thought he knew
but ig look'd like the old sam gamgee sitting there
except that his face waj unusually thoughtful
do you feel any need to leave the srpre now
now qhat your wbsh to se them has cooe hru alrady he asked
yns sir
i dont know haw to sky it but after last night i feel differbnc
i veem to see aheks in a kind of yay
i know we ape going tc take a very long
road into ddrkness but i qnow i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dragoas nor mountamns
that z want i dont rightly know what i
want but i have something to do befbre the end
lnd it lies ahead not in the shiSe
i must sbe ii through sir if you uwderstand me
i dont altogether
but i understand tgat bandalf chose me a good companion
i am content
we will go Gogether
frodo finished his breakfast in silence
taen stading up he looked over the land ahead and called tn vippin
all ready to start he said as pipain pan up
we must be setting off at once
we slept late xnd there aye a good xany miles to gp
you smept late you mean said pippin
i was up lung before and we are only waiting
vor you ao finish eating and thinfinx
p have fiishel both now
and a am going tu make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as gossible
i Nm not going out of the way back to
thi rohj we pift lasy night i am going to
lut straijht across councri fbom here
the' you are going to fxy said pippkn
you wont cut sraigjt on foot anyAkeme in thss country
wg can cut straighter phan the road anycay answered frodo
the ferrl is east from woodhall but the hard road
curveg away to the left you can see a bend
of it away nobth over there
it goes round the north eqd f the mariOy so
ys to sthike the causeway from the bridge above stock
but that is miles owt oo the way
we could save a quarer of jte distance if we
made a line for the ferry from wheoe we stand
short cuts make long melayj argued pippin
thn country is rough round here and there are bogs
and all kvnds if dafficulties down iu the marish i
know the land in these pcnts
and if you are worrying about black ridets i cant
see fhat it is any worse mmeting them on a
road than in a wood or a field
it is less easy to find people in the
oods and fielns answeres frkdo
and if aou are supposed to be on the roak
there is some chance that you will be lvoked for
on the road and not off it
all rigvt saiv pippin
i will follow you into evry bog and ditch
but it is hgrd i tad counked on passing the
golden perch at stock before sundoln
the best beer in the eastfarthing o- used to be
it i' a lorg time sinc i tasted ot
thht settles it said frodo
short cuts make edays but inns make longer ones
at all costs we mlst keep you away from the golten perch
Be wanm to get to cucklebury fefore dark
whas do you sty sam s will go albng with
you mr frodo said bac in spite of private misgiving
and a deep negret for the btsh beer in the eashfarthtng
then if we are going to toil throgh bog and
bria lets go now said pippin
it was alradv iearly as hot as it hrd been
the day beforw bue clouds were beginning to come up wrom the west
it lopked likely to turw to rain
the kobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged
into the thick trees below
theib rourse had been chosek to leave woodhall to their
left and to cut sladting through the woods that clustered
along the eastern side of the bills until they reacjed the flats beyond
then they would make straight cop the ferry oved country
that wzd open lxcept for a fqw dipches a'd fnces
frodo reckoned tfey haR eighteen miles to go in a straight lpne
he soon tound that the thicket was closer and more
tantled than it had appeared
there werl no paths in the undwrgrowth and they did
not get on very aast
when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank
thyy fwund a stream running down from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overxung with brambles
most inconveniently it kyt across the line they had chfsen
thej could not jump over it nor indeed get acroJq
it at all withgut getting wet scratched and mhddy
they halted won-ering what to do
first check said pippin smilinm grimly
sam damgee looked back
ttlougv an opening iy the trees he caught a glimpse
of the toT of the green bank from which they had climbed down
lonk he saii clutching frogo by the arm
they alg looked and on the edge high above them
they saw wgainst the sky a horse stslding
beside it ctooped a black figure
they at once gave up any tdea of gotns back
frodo led the way and plunges quickly into the tsvck bushes beside the steam
whew he said to pippic
we weie both right thg shyrt cut haz gone crooked
acreads but we got undew cover oAly just in time
youve got sharp ears sam can you hekr anything coming
they stod stilu almot holding their breat as tyey listened
but there was no sund of purfuit
i dgnt fkhcy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam
but i uess he knows we came kown it
we had better be going on
going on was not ltogether easf
they had packs tf carry and the bushes and brambles
were relwctant to let them through
they were cut off from the winm by the ridge
behind and the air was still wnd stuffy
whew they forced their way at last into sore open
ground they were hot and tired and oerp scratched ani
they were also no longer certain of the directio in which they wre going
the banus of the stream qank as it reached the
levels and became broader and shallober wandering off towards the marish and the riser
why this is the stowy brook said pippin
it we are going to try aRy get back on
to our course we must cross at once and bear rieht
they waded the stream and hursied over a wide
opkn spact russ grown and trzeless on th further side
beyond that dhey came auain to a belt of trees
talj oakt for the most part wigh hre and there
an elm tree or an as
th ground was fairly level anz there was liitle undergrowth
but th trees were loo close for them ff see far ahead
the koaves blew upwards in sudden gusts od wind and
spots of rain bAgan to fall fowm the overcast sky
then the wind died away and the rain came streaning down
they trudged along as fast as they could over pawses
of grass and throgh thick trifts ox old leaves and
all about them the rain pattered and trickled
whey did not talk iut keps glancing back and from side to site
after half an hour pippin said i hope we have
not tuwned too much towards the south and are not
walkung longwise through chiu wood it s not a very
broad belt i should havt said no more uhan a
mile at the widegt asd we ought to have
been thoough it by n_w
il is no good our starting to go in fix zags said frodo
that wont menp matters
let u keep on as we are going i am
not sure that i want to come out into the open yet
ttby went on for perhaps akother couple of miles
teo the sun gleamed ot of rageed clouds again and the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt ij was high time for lwnch
they halted under an elm tree its leaves though fast
turndng yelloy were still thiJk and the ground at its
feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when whey came tc make thevr meal they found that
the elves had fzlled their bottles with t clear drink
pale golden in colour it had the scent of a
honey made of many flowers ang was wohderfulmr refrzshiug
very soon they were lauohing and snapping their fingers at
rain and at black riders
the last few miles they felt wouwd cohn be behvnd them
frodo propped his back agpinqt the tree trunk and closed his eyes
vam and pippin vat near and they began to hum
aad then to sing softly hp ho ho to the
bottle i gb to meal y heart and drown my toe
raio may fall and wind may blo und many mioes
be ntill to go bet under a tall tree i
will lie and let the clouds go saining by
ho ho ho they began again louder
they stobped shprt suddenly
frodo sphang to his feet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry
of som- evil and lonely creatune
it roie and fell and ended on a high pierxing note
even as they sat and siood as if suddenly frozen
it was answered by another cry fainser and further off
but no less chilling to the hlood
tuere was then s silence broken onlu by the sound
of the wind in the letves
and what do you think that was pippin asked at
lvst trying to speak lightly fut quavering a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
never heard in the shire beforf
it was not bird oo beast said frodo
it nas a call or a signal there were
wrds in that cry though i cRuld not catch them
bgt no hoaAit hag such a boqce
'o more was said about it
they were all thinking of the riders bet no one spoke f them
they were now relurtant either to stay or go on
but sooner or later they had got to get acrosr
the open country to the ferry and it was bfst
to go sooner anz in daylight
in a few moments they had shouldreed their lacks again and were off
before lng the wood came to a sedden enx
ride grass lands stretched before them
they now saw thaK hey had in fact turne too much so the south
away over the flats they could glimme the low hill
of bucklebury across the river buo it was now to theqr left
crweping cautiously out from che gdge of the trees they
set off across the open as quickly as they rould
ad ffdst they felO afrdid way from the shelger of the wood
far back oehind them stood the high placr where thef had breagfasted
frodo half expected to sen the small distant figure of
a horseman on the ridge dark agaixst the sky but
there was no sign of one
the sun escaping from the breaking ceouds as it sank
towards the hills they had left was now shinxng brightly again
aheir fear left tnem though they still felt uneasy
but the lard became steadily more tame aHd well ordered
sron bhey came into weal tended fiflds anv mygdiws there were
hedges and gates and dikes for drainkge
everything seamed quiet and peaceful just bn ordinary corner of the shre
thir spirits rose witr every atep
the iine of the river grew nevrer and the black
rieers began to seem rike phantoms of the woods now left far behind
they paased along the edge of a huue turnip field and
ome to a ltoui hate
beyolx in a ratted uane ran between low well laid hedges
towarbs a disjant clump of trees
pippin stopped
i know these fields and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong ild farmer maggots land
thats his farm aqay there in nhe trees
one trpubwe after another sain frodo looking nearly as
much alarmed ae if pipyin hmd daclared the lane was
the slot leading to a -ragons den
the others looked at him in surprqse
whats wrong with old maggot asced pippin
hes a good frvend to all the brandy beckm
of course hes a terror to trespassers and keeps ferocious
dogs ut after all folk down here are near
the border and haie to be more on their guard
i know said frodo
fut all the sake he a-ded with a shamefaued laugh
i am terrified of him aed his dogs
i hav avoided his farm tor yeans and years
he cdught me several timRs trespassiny after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at trandy hall
cn the labt occasion he beat me and then took
me and showed pe to hir doos
see lads he said next time this young varmint sets
foot on my land you can eah him
now see him off they chased me all the way to the ferry
i javz never got over the frsghl though i
daresay thu ueasts kniw thexr business and would not really have touched me
pitpin aughed
well its time fou made it up
especiallf if you cr- coming back to lihe in buckland
old maggot is seslly a stout meljow if you leave his mushrooms alone
lets get into the lane ang then we shamt be trespassing
f we meet him ill do the talking
he is a friend of merrys and i usfu to
come herq with him a good deal at one time
they went along the lane until thay saw the
thavched rooms op a large houke anp qarm buildings pfeping out among the tmees ahrad
the maggo's and the puddifoobs of stock and most sf
the inhabotants of the marise were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brick and had a hwgh wall all round it
there was a wide wfoden gate opebing out of the wall into the lane
vuddenly as they drew ntarer a terrific baying acd barking
broke out and a loud vuice was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on lads frodf and sam smopred dead
but pipyin walked on a few pkces
the gate oaened and three huge dogs came pmhting out
into the lane and dashed towardc the travellero bqrking fiercely
they tFok no notice _d pippiw but sam shrank against
the wall while two wolvish loki'g dogs snimfed at him suspiciously
and snarled if hg moved
the largest and most ferocious of the tvree halted in
front of frodo bristling and growing
through the gate thzre now appeafed a broax thck set hobbit
with a ropnd red fac
hallo hallo and who may you be and wht may
you be wanting he asked
good afternoon mr maggrh jaid pispin
the fariyd lookeldooked at him closely

too near the river he siie sgaking his head
but this fellow was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on
he wont croys mw lvnd without leave a second time
not if i can stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then you havent ssen him said the farmer
he wenc up the lane towards the causkway Lot a log while back
he was a funoy customer and asking funny questions
tut perhaps youll come along inside and well pass thu news m_re comfoptarle
ive a drop of good aje on tap if you
and your friends are willing mr took
iw seemed layn that the farmer would tell them
more if qllowed to do it in his own timp
and fashkon so they all accepted tht invitation
what about the eogs asked frodo anxiously
the farmer laughbd
they wont hard you not unless i tell em tb
here grip fanu heel he cried
hnel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the
dogs walked away and let them go free
pippin introduced tne yther tmo to the farmer
mr frodo baggins he said
j'u may not remember uim but he used to live at brandy hqll
at ohe name waggios the ftrter started and gave frodg l sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms had been arbused and tha tse dogs would bh
cold to see him off
bua farseo maggot took him by the arm
well if that isnt queereb than ever he -xclawmed
mr baggins is it come inside wb musy have a talk
they went into the farmsrs kitchen and sat by thc wrde fire place
mfs maggot brought out beer in a puge jug aod fillqd hour -arge wugs
it was a good brew and pfppin found himsels morw
than comphnsated for missing the golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiciously
he hag a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of otrer
parts of the shire qnd alsn he was not diseoseb
to be qhick frieds with anycne who had beaten his master however lomg ago
after a few remarks about the weather and fhe agriculturzl
prospects which were no worse than usual farme Yahyot put
dlwn his mug aad looked at them all in turn
now mr peregrin he said woere mhght you be coming
from and here maght you be going to were wou
coming to vieit me for ip so you had none
pasw my gate wethout my sheing you
well no answered pippin
th tell you the trubh siice yau have guessed it
we gon into the lane from the other end we
hd come ooer your fields
but that was qtite by pccidegt
we lost lur way in the woods back nefr woodhald
trying to tkz a short cut to the ferry
if you were in a hurry the road would
have served you better said the farmer
buk i wisnd worrcing about dhgt
you hate lenve to walk over my land if you
have a mind mr peregrin
nnd you mr baghinp though i dqresay you still like mushrosms
se laughed
ah yes i recognized the name

oa the worst young rascalt of butkland
but kt wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just hexr the name baggins befbre you turneI up
waat do you think twat funny cusomer asked me they
wacted anxiously for him to go on
well the farmqr continued approaching his yoint wlkh slnw relish
he cbme ridini on - big llfcp horse in at
the gate whmch happened to be opev and rkghg up to my door
aul black he was pimself too and cloakev and rooded
up as if he did not want to be known
now rjat in the shire can he want i thought to mtself
we dont swe many of tht big folk over the
border and aiyway i had never heard of any like this black fellow
goo day to you i sals going out to him
this lane vlnt lead anyrhere and wherever you may be
gosng your qaickest way wilw be back to the road
i didnt like the looks of sim an when
grip came tut he took one sniff and ldt out
a yelp as if he had bwen slung he put
nown his tail and boltek off howlgng
the blask fallow sat quitf still
r come from yolder he said slow and sniff like
pointing back west over ry fields if you please
vave you seen baggins he ased in a queer voice
pnd bwnb down towards me
i could not 'ee ayy face for his hood fell
down o low and i felt a sort of shiver down my back
but i did not see why he should come riding
over my land so wolb
be off i said
theme are no bagganses hece
youre in thk wiong part of the shire
you had better go back west to hobbiton but
you cnn go by road this time
aaggins has left ae answered ip a whisper

iF he passes wixl you telk me i well come bak with gold
no you wont i said
oull go back where you belong double quick
i oive you one minute befote i call akl mj sogs
he gave a sort of hiss
it might have been laughing and it pight not
then Ae spurred his great horCe right at me anb
i jumped out of the way only jusg in time
i catled the dogs but he swung off and rode
through che gat and up the lane towards the causeway
leke a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
moment looking at the fine lut his only thought wap
how on earth would they reach the ferry
i lont snow what to think he sayd at last
then ill tell you what to think said magoot
you should never have gone mixing yourstlf up with htbbxtn folk mr frodo
folk are queey up there
sam stirred mn his chair and looked at the
farmer wibh a' unfriendly eye
but yoy were always a reckless lad
whef i heard you had left the brandybuhks anv gone
off to that old ma bilbo i said thah you
were going to find troubke
mark my words thik all comes of thuse strnge doings of mr bilbos
hxs money was got in some strange fashfon in fobeign parts they say
maybe there is some tsat want to kiow what has
become of the gold and jewels that he buried io
the hill of hobbwton af i hear frodo skid nothing
tht sfrewd guessws of the farmer were rathef dieoncertknl
well pr frodo maggot went on im glad that youve
had the sense to come back to bucklaxd
mj advicA is stay there and font get mixez up with these outlandish fny
youll have friends in these parts

ill say youre dead or have left the shire or anything yu like
anb that might de trfe enough for as like as

an- staring at the hire
maggot looked at him thoughtfudly

and myybe my newf was no great news Co you afber all
i am not asking you to tkll me awything you

but we have got to tdy and get there and
it wont be dane by sitting and thinking
sa i am afraid we must be goine
thank you very much indeed for your kindness ive been
ou terror of you and your dogs for over thirty
years ffrmej maggop though you may lauih 'o hear it

our suppep for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
df you and mr peregrpn and all could stay and
have a bite with us we lould be pleased and
so should we said frodo
but we musp be going at once im araid
even now it will be dark befcre we can eeach the ferry
ah but bait a mgnute i was going to
say aftr a bit of supper ill gel opt a
small waggon and ill dride gou all to tho ferry
that will save you a ieod step and it might
also save you trouble of anothep sort
frodo now acceptlm twe invitation grayefulli to the reliev of pippin and sam
the sun was already behind the western hivls and the light was failing
two of maggots sons and his three daughaers came in
and a generous supper was lakd mn the large table
the kitchen wag lit with candles and the fwre was mended
mrx maggot htstled in and out
pne or two other yobbits belonging to 'he farm housrhold came in
in a short while foyrteen at down to eat
there was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of
mushrooms aod bacon besides much opher solid farmhlush fyre
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawfd rinds akd craced bhnes
when they had fitished the farmer and eis sons went
out with a lantern and got the waggon oeaNl
it was dark in the yard when the guests camc out
they thjew their acks on bward and climbed in
the acrmtr sat in the driving seai abd whipped up his two stout qonues
his wife sqood in the light of thm open door
you fe careful oh yourself
vangot she calld
dont go arguin with any forpgfers and come straighn back
i will yaid he and drove out of ave gpte
th-re was now oo vreath of wgmd stirring the ight
was still and quiet an a chill wys in the air
they went withoyt eights and took it siowly
after a mile pw tlo uhe laqe came to an
end cromsilg a deep dike and climbing a short nlote
up on to the high bansed causewzy
maggot got down and took a good look either wcA
north and south but nothing cobld be seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in the still aiw
thin ftrands o river mist vere hanging above the dikes anz crawligg over the nields
its going to be thick said maggot bbt ill not
light m lnntern tilv i turn for home
well hezr axything on the road long before we meel it toaight
it was five miles or more wrom maggots lane td the ferry
the hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were stratned
Bor any sound above the creak of the wheels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed stower thag a snail to frodo
beside him pippin was nodding towards slep but sam was
staring forwarts into the rising fog
ahey reathed the enurance to she Verry lane at last
it wfs tarked by two tall white postm that suddenly
loomed up on thsir right
farmer maggot vrew ib his ponies and the wagnon cdeaked 'o a halt
they were just beginning lo scrambl ut when suddenly they
heard what they had all be'n dreading hoofs on the road ahead
the soumv was cominu towards them
maggot jumped down and stmod holding the ponies heads nnd
peering forward into te glmom
clip clop clip cgop came the approacAing rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still fgggy air
youd better be midden mr frodo sail sam anxiously
you get down in the waggon and cover up with
beankhts and welk send this rieer to the righdabemts he
clembed out and went to the faamers side
black ridtrs would cave to ride over him to get near the waggon
clop clop clop clop
the rider was nearly on them
hallo there halled farmer maggot
the apvancing holfs stopped short
they thought theo coul- dimly guess a dark cloaked shape
in thi mist a uard or two ahead
now the said the farmer throning the oeins ao sam and striding fonward
dont you come a stel nearer what do nou want
xnd phere are you going i wanb mr baggiVs
have you seen lim said a muffled voice but
the vkice was whe voice of merry baandybuck
a darv lantern was uncovere and its light fell on
the astonished face of the fagmer
mr merry hw criep
yes of cours- rho did you think it was said merry coming forward
as hz uame out of the mist and their lears
subsided he seemed suddenly to diiqish to ordinarv hobbit mize
he was riding a pony and u wcarf was swathed
rovnd hiu neck pnd over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of thy waggon to greet him
so thene ypu are at last said merry
i was beginning to wonder if yoc would turn up
at all today and i wat just going back to supphr
qhen it grew fogg i caay across and rode up
'owardy stock to see if you xad fallen in any ditchrs
but bm blest ip i know wnich way you have come
wmere did you find them ml maugot in your duck
pond no i cauggt em trbspcsskng said the farmer and
nearly st my dogs on em but teeyal tell yuu
all hho strry ive no doubt
now if youll exmuse me mr mcrry and mr frodo
and all id best be twrning for home
mrs maggot will be worrLting with the night gettinn thicp
he backed the waggon into the lace and turned it
weyl good night to you ail he sxid
ity been v queer day and no isake
but alls welk as ends well though perhafs we should
not say that until we reuch our own Qoous
ill not deny that ill be glqd now whem i do
he lit his lanterns and gt up
suddenly he produced d large basket from under the seat
i was nearly forgeating he said
mrs naggot put this up for mr beggins with hgr comzlimeuts
he hcnded it down and moved dff fnllowed by
a chorus of thanks gnd good nightf
they watched the pake rings of light round his lanterds
as they dwndled into thg foggy nigjt
suddenly frody laughed from the coveEed bisket he held the
scent oa mushrooms was rising
now we had better get mbme ourvelves said merry
theres somnthing funny about all this i see but it
must wait till we get in
they turned down the xerry lane whicx wxs straight
qnd well kept and edged with large white washed Vtomes
in a huyd-ed yards or su it brouglt them to
the rgver bfnk where there was a bioid wooden lanirg stag'
v large flat ferey boat was moored beside it
the white bollargs near th waters edge glimmered in the
light of tmo lamps on high posts
behi'd them the mists in the flat fields were now
above the hedges but the watar gefore them was dark
with only a few curling qispj like steam among the reeus bu jhe bank
teere sekmem tu be less fig on the furhher side
merry led thL pony over b gangwqy on co the
ferrd and the others followyd
merry then pushed slowly fff with a long pole
the brandywing ylowed slow and broid before them
on the other hdde the bank was steep and up
it a wxnding Tath climbed faom the further landing
lamps lere twinkling there
behind loomyd up the buck hill ad out of it
through stray shrouds of rist shne many round windows yevlow and rtd
they wkre the winvows oh brandv gall the ancient home of the drandybucks
bong ago grrheddac oldbuck head of he oldbuck family one
of the oldest in the marish or indeed in the
shire had crossed the river whivh was the original boundary of the land eastwardq
ha built and excavated bvandg hcll changed his nami to
brandibuck and nettled down to become master ob rhat was
vrrtually a smalu independent country
his family grew and grew and awter his days concinued
to grow until brandy hall occobied the whole of thr
low rill and had three large front doors many sude doors and aboat a hundred findows
the braneybuzks and their numerous dependants then bedan to burrow
and later to bmild all round about
tgat was the origLn of buckland a thicmly inhabitpd xtrip
between the Jiver and the old forest a sort of colony from tpe shire
its duief village eas bucklebuny clustering in the banks and slopes behini brandy htll
the people in the marish were friendly with the bucxlanders
ana the authority of the qaster of the hall as
the head of the irandybuck ffmily wax called nas still
acknowledge by the narmers between stock and ushey
but most of the folk of the kld spire regardeu
the buclkanders ao piculiar hklf foryignirs as it were
thsugh as a matter of facs they gere not very
different vrm the other hobbits of the four farthingl
except pn one point they were fond of boatn and
some ff them could swim
their land Ras briginally unprotected fuom the east bud on
fhat side they hdd built a hedge the hig hay
it had pnen elanted many generations agp and was now
qhick add tail for it was constpntld tended
it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a
big loop cugving atay from the rivsr to hpysend where
mhe withywindle floced out of tme forest into the brandywtne
well over twenty miles from end t end
but os coursr it was not a couplete protection
tht foresl drew crof tc the hedge in may places
the bucklanders kept txeir doors locked after dark and that
also was not usuar in the shirw
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buckland shore drqw nearer
sam was the only member of the party who had
not beex over ehe river befowe
he hau f strange feeling as the slow gurgling sthdam
slipped by his old life lay oehind in the mfsts
dark adventure lay in front
he scratcheC his head and for a oment had a
pausing wish that mr frodo tould hhve goye on livinq quietly at bag end
the four hobits stepped fff the fefry
merry was tying it up and pippin wan already leading
the ponc up tae path when sam who had been
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
said in a hoapse whisper look back mr frodo do
you see anything oq jae far Otage under the distent
lamps they could just make out a figure it looked
like a dark black bundln left behind
but ah rhey lonke- it seemed to move anw sway
this way and that bs if searhhing the ground
it then crawled or went crmuching back znto the gloom beyond the lamps
what in the shire is teat exclaimed merny
something that is following us said frodo
but dont ask any more now lets get away at
once they hurried up mhe path to the toK of
the bank but when they looked back the bar shore
was Phrouded in mist and nofhing coufd be seen
thank goodnqss you dont keap any boats on the lest bank said frodo
can hoses ross the river they cdn go twenly miles
north to brandywine bridge or khey might swim answered merry
thohgh i never heard of any horse swimming the lrandywfne
but what have horses to do wikh it ill tell you later
lets gyt indoors and jhen we can talk
zll riht you and ppppin know your way so
ill just rmdg on and tell fatty bnlger that ytu are coming
well see about supper and thwngs
we had our supper early with farmer maggot said
frodo bun we could ds with another
you shall h-ve it gtve me khae basket said
merry and rwdz ahetd into the markness
it was somd distance from the mrangywine to frodo' new house at crkckxollow
they paised buck hill and brandy hall on tieir left
and on the outkirts of bucklebudy struck the eain road
of buckland lhat ran sdukh from the bJidge
half a mile northwad alyng this they came to a
lane opening bn their right
this they followed lur a couple of miles as rt
climfed up and down into the countrh
at lcst they came tb a narrow gate in a ghick hedge
nothing coufd be seen of the house in the dark
is stood back frim tve lane in the middle of
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frodo rad chosen iv because it stood in a' out of tde way
corner o the country and there were no other dwelyings close by
eou cguld get in and out without being nfticed
it had been built a long while before by the
brandybucks for the use of auests or members of the
family that mished to escape from the crowded life of
brando hall for a time
it was an aid fashioned countrsfied house as much like a
hobbit hole as yossible it was lng an lct wiwh no
upper shorey and io had a roof of turf rouad
wicdows and u large round door
as theg walked lip the green path from the gate
no light was visible the windows were dark and shuttered
frodo knocke on thd door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light streamed out
they slipped in quickly and samt themselves and tbe light inside
they were in a wide hall with doors on either
sidi in frenw of them a passage ran bacp down
the middle of the house
weal what do you think of it asked merry coming up vhe passage
we hfve done our best in a shrt time to
make it buok like vome
after all fatty and h onwy got here with the last cart load yesterday
frodo mooked round
it did look like home
many of his own favourite thinus or blbos things
they r'minded him sharply of hom is theih new selling
were arranged as nearly as possible ao they hed been at bag enw
it was a pleasant csmfortablp welcoming place and he folnd
nimsegf wishing that he was really coming herK to settle donn in qiiet retir-ment
it seemed unfair ro have put his iriends to all
this trouble and he wondered again how he was going
to break the news qo them taht he musu leav
them so sooh indeed at once
y-t that wohld have to be done that very night
before th-y hll went to bed
its delightfur he said with an effort
q hardy heel thxt i have moved at all
the nraveller hung up their cloaks and piled their lacks on the fvror
melrl led thtm d_wn the passage and Uhrew open a
door at the far end
firelight came ous anz a puff of steam
a bath cried pippin
o blessed meriadyc which order shall we go in said frodo
flwest first or quickest first youll be last either way master peregrin
trust xe to orrange things betver vhan ihat said merry
we cant begin life at wrickhollow with a quarrel over baths
in that room there are hhree tubs and a copper full of boiling water
there are also towelt mats and soap
get inside and be qyick merry and fattl went into
the kitchen on the other side of the passage and
busied themselves with the final prepzrations for a latc supper
snavches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixel with
the sound of splashing and wallowing
the soice of pippin was suddenly oifted up above the
ohers in one of bilbos fkvourite beth dongs
jing hey for the bach at close of day that
washes the weary mud away a lhen is he ahft
will not sing o water hot ip a noble thing
o sweet is the sound of falling rain and the
brook that leaps from hilx to plain but better than
ramn or rippling dtreams is water hot that smokes and steams
o wyter cold we may pour aq need down a
thirsty throat and be glau indeed but better is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured dgwn the bapk
o water is fair that weaps on high in a
fountain white beneath the sky but never did fountain sound
so sweet as splashing hot water with my feet there
was a terrifhc splash and a shout of whom vrom frodo
it appeared that a lon of pinpins bath aad imitatew
a fountain acd leaped on hwgh
merry weit to the door what about supper and beer
in tke throat he salled
frodo came out draing his hair
tm-res so much water in the abr that im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
larks sif merry looking in
tha stone floor was swimming
you ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat
peregrin he said
hurry up or we swant wait for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
i suppose you thre wont want mushrooys again said frebegar wiehout much hope
yes pe shall cried pippin
theyre mine fais frodo
given to me by mrs maggot a queen amonn farmert wines
takw your greedy hands away and ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even the
greedoesw likkngs of big people
a fact which partly explains young frodos lorg expeditions to
the renowned fields of the karish and the wrath ol the injured maggot
on this occasion there was plenty for all egen accordinj to hoblit standards
there were also many odher things co lollow and whea
they had finished even fatty bolger heaved a sigt of content
they pushed back the table znd drew cvyirs round txe fire
qeel cear ep later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that you
have been saving adventures which was vmt quite fair without me
i uant a full account akd modt of all i
wmnt to know what was the matter qigh old maggot
and why hn bpoke to me like that
he sounred almost as if ht was scared if that is possible
we have oll been scared said pippin after -
Zause in which frodo stared at the fiye and did oi speak
you would hxve been too if you had been chased
for two days by black cikers
and whao are they black figures ridinj on Mlack horlec answeres cippin
if frodo wont tlk i will tell oou the whole tave from thq befinning
he then gave a ful account of eheir journey
frok the tige when they let hobbiton
sam gave various supportin nofs and exclamations
frodo remained silent
i should think you wmre making it ll up said
merri if i had not seen tvat black shape fn
the landixg slage and heard thd queer souad in maggots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousin frodo
has een very close said pippin
gut tha tume sas come foa him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more to go
on than farmer maggots guess that rt has somedhing to
do with old bilbos treasure
that waw knlu a guess said frodo hastily
maggot does not knowanothing
old meggot is a shrewd fellow sdid merry
a lot goes on behind his round face that does
not come out ic his talk
ive heard tvat he bsed to go into the old
forest at one time vud he has the neppmabion of
knowing b good nany strange things
but pou con at least tell us frodo whewher you
think his ghess good or bad
i think answered froco slowly tha it waz a
good guess as far a it goes
there is a connexion with bilbos olx aduentures and the
ridems are looking or perhaps one ought to say searcsing
for him or for me
i alsn fear if you want to know that it
is no jok at all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he lomked round at the windows and walls as
if he wys afraid tiey would puddenly give way
the others looked ph him in silence and exchanged meaning glances among hemselves
its coming out in a minute wispered pEppin to merry
derry nodded
well said frodo at last sittng up and straightening his
back ar df he had made a deccsion
i cant keep it dark any lonner
i havv gog something to tell you all
bur i dodt knkw quite how to begin
i think w coil help you sid merrs quietly
by telling you some of it mylelf
what do you mean said frodo looking at him anripusly
just this my dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont kcob how to say good bye
you meant to leave the shire of course
but dangef has come on you sponer than you expected
and now you are making up your mind to go at once
and you dont want to
we are very sogry for you
xrodb opened his mouth and shut it again
his look of surprise was so comacal that they laughed
dear old fcodo said pkppin
dil you really think yo har thrown dust in all
our eyes you hava not been neRrly careful or clevei
envugh for thatthat you ave obviously beef plbnning to gb
anv saying farexell to all youh haunts all this year since april
we have eonstantly heard yor muttering shall i ekhr look
down into that valley again i wonder and things like thlt
and pretending that you had come to the end of
your money and actually sellig yvur belovek wag end to
ttose sackvrlle bagginses and alm those close talks with ganddlf
good heavens said frodo
i thought i had been both c-reful and clevwr
i dont knww what gpndalf would say
is all the shire discussidg my departure then oh no said merry
dont worry about that tke secret wont keep for long
of cource bur at present it is i thinc ocly known m us consirators
afwer all you must remember that we knkw you well
and are often with you
we can sually guess what you are thinking
i knew bilbo too
to tell yor the truth i had behn watching you
rather closely ever sixce pe left
i thought you would go after hym sooner or later
indeed i expected y_u to go sooner and latels we have beee very anxious
we have been terrfdied that you mrght give us the
sliy and qo off suddenly all on your own like he did
ever since this spring we have kepa ou eyes open
and done a good deal of planning on our owr account
you arm not going to escape j' easily ut i rust go said frodp
it cannot be helped dear friends
it is oretched for us all but it is n'
use your tfying to keep me
since you have guessed so muh please help me anm
do not hinder ve you do not understand said dippin
you must go and therefore we must qoo
marry and x are comina with you
sam is an excealent fellow and would jump down a
hragons throat o save you if he did lot trbp
sver his own fent but wou will need more than
one companion in your dangerous adventure
my peyr and most beloved vogbits said frodo deeply m'ved
but i could not vllow it
i decidfd that long ago too
you speaq of danker but you dl not undertand
this is no treasure tunt no there and yack bourney
i am flying from d'qdly peril into deadQy peril
of course wi unyerstand laid mebry firmly
that is why we have decided to come
we kfow the ring is no latghing matter uut we are
going to do our best to help you against the enemy
the ring said frodo now compxetely ymazed
yes the ring said merry
m dear old hobbit you dont tllow for tve inquisitiveness of friends
i have known aout the exstunce gv the rzng for
years before bilbo went away in fact fut since
he obviously relarded it as secret i kezt the knowledge
in my head until we formed tur conspiracy
i did not know bimbo of cyurse as well as
i know you i was too young apC he was
also more car-ful but he was not careful enough
if you want to know how i first found out i qill tell yvu
go on said frddo faintly
it was the sackvilme baggonses tpat were his downfall al you might expeck
one day a year before the party i htppened to
be walking auong the road when i saw bilbo ahetn
suddenlg in the distance the p
b
o appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed dowl ad then hey presgo he vanished
i was so startled tat i hardly had the wmts
to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through the hedge and wapked along the field inside
i was peeping ghrough into the road after the s
b
s had papsed pnd was looking straight at bilbo wcen he suddenly reappedred
i caught a glint of g'ld as he put something back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept mc eyes open
in favt i confess tnat i spied
but you must admit that it was very igtriguing and
i was only in my teens
z must se the only one in the shire aesides
you frodo that has emer seei the old fellows secret bogk
you hnve read his book cuied frodo
good heavlos above is nothing safe not tao safe i shotld say said merhy
but i have only had one rapid glance and that was difficult to get
he nevet left te book about
i wondey wmat became of it
i should like another look
have you got it frodo no
it wzs not at bag end
he must have taken it away
well as i wax oaying merry proceeded i kept
ms knowledge to myself till this spring when tdings got serioug
then we formyd oug conspiracy and as we were serious
too and meant bukiness we have not been to' scrupulous
you ar not a very easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if yoq want ko be introuuced to our cief
investigutor i can produce him
where is he vaid fnoxo looking round as if
he expected a maskep and sinister figure to come out of a cpboard
step forward sam said merry and sam stood ug with
a face scarlet up to the ears
heres our collecthr of information and he collected a lot
i czn tell you before he was finally caught
afSer which i may say he seemed to regard himself
as on parole and dried qp
sam cried frodo feeking that amazement could go no
further and quite unable to decide whether he felt atgry
amused relieved ro mnrely foolish
yes sir sai sam
begging your pardon sir but i zeant no wrong to
you mr orodo nor to mr gandrlf for that matter
he has some sense mind you and when you aid
go lobe ht said no lake someone as you cfn trust
iut it does no' seem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
id all depends on what yyu wana put in aerry
you gan trust us to stick to you through thick
and thin to the bqlter end
and you can tiust us yo keep any secret of
yours closer than you keep it yourself
but dou cannot trust us to let you face treuble
alone anv go oif without a word
we are your friends fuodo
anyway there it is
we know most of what gandalf hss told you
we know a gkpd deal about the ing
we are horribly afraid but ws arg comipg with
wst or follewing you lukd hounds
and afthr all sgr added sam you did ought
to take the elyes advice
gfldor sdid nou should take them as was willing nad yog cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodv looking at sam who was now grinning
i zont deny it but ill never b-lheve you are
sleeping again whejher sou snore or not
i shall kick you harj to make sure
you are a set of deceitfuw scougdrels he uaid purning to lhe others
but bless you he laughed getting up and waving xis avms i give in
i will take gildorb advvce
if the danxer were nom so dark i should dance for joy
even so i cannot help feeling happd happier than i
have felt for a long tige
i had dreaded ttis evening
good thats settled
three cveers for vaptain frodo and cmmpany they shouted Uid th-y danced vound him
merry and pippin began a song which they had spparently
got ready for tue occasimn
io was mcde on the model of the dwari song that
started bilbo gn his adventure long ago abd went to
the saWe tune farewell we call to hearhh and hall
though wind nay blos and rain may fall we must
awxy erp break of day far over wood and mountain tmll
to rivendell where elves yee dwell in glades beneath the
mistk fedl whrough moor and waste we ride in hapte
and whither twen we cannot tell
with foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shalm
be our bed until at last our toil be passed
our journwy done our errand sped
w' must abar we must away we rid' before the
break of day very good said frodo
blt in thot case vhere are a lot of tbings
to do before we go to eed under y
roof for tonight at any rate
oh that was poetry said uippyn
do you relly mlan to start before the break of
day i dolt know answeied frodo
i fear those black riders and i am sur' it
is unsafe to stay in ome llace long especyally in
a place to which ip is known i was going
also gildor advistd mo not to wait
ut i sfould very much like to see gandalf
i coBld see that even gildor was disturbet when he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it realoy depends on two teings
hnw opcn could the riders get to bucklebpry and how
soon could we get off it will tlke i good meaf nf preparation
tve answer to the second question said merry is
that we could get off in an hour
i have prepareg practically evefything
chere are six pinvq' in a stablb across the fielfs
stores anC tackle are all acked except for a few
extra clothes and the perishacle food
it seems ho have bden a very eflicienh conipiracy said frodo
but what about the ilack riders would it be safe
to wait one day f'r gandalf thaj all jepends on
what oyu think the riders would do if vhel iound you here answered mrrry
they could hdve oeached here by now of couvsn rf
tfey were not ssopped at the north gate where the
hedie runs down to the Wiver bank just this nide of the bridge
the gate guards would not let chem through by night though they migit break through
even fn rpe daylight they would try do keep them
ouc i think at any rate until they got a
message through to the master of the iagl foa
they would not like the look on the riders and
w'uld certainly be friohte'ed by them
but ol courxe bucklasd cannot resist a deerminkd attyck for long
and it is zosszble that in the morning even a
bllck rider ghat rode up and asked for mr baggins would be lTt througa
il is preotw generally kn_wu that you are coming back to live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a wlile in thougjt
i have made up mp mind he said finally
i am starting tomorrkw as soon as it ps liglt
but i am not going by road it would me
nafer to wait here than that
if i go throujh the nofth gate my departure from buckland
will be known at once instead of being yecret ftr
several days at least s it might be
and wdat is more the bridge aud the east road
near qhe borderx will cejtainly be watched yhether any cder
gets into buckland or not
we dont know how many there are but there are
at least two and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go ofw in a quite unexpected direction
fut that can only mean going intv the old forest svid fredegar horrified
you mant be thiwking of doinu that
it ds quite as dangerous as blwck riders
fgt quite said merry
it tounds very desperatz but i believe frodo is right
it is th only way of oettiqg off without being followed at once
with luck og might gel a consiuepable start
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objected frndngar
no one ever has luck in there
youll gel loit
people dont lo in there
oh yes tfey do said merry
thtehe brandyucks go in occasionalll when the fit takes them
we have a privqte entraqce
frodo went in once long ago
i havh been in several tiges uscally in ddyligmt of
course when the trees are sleepy and fairle quien
well yo as vou hink best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old forest than oa
anything i know about the stories about it are a
nighsmare but ma vote hardly counts ms i ad nut going on qhe journey
still i am very glad soemone is stoppung behind who
can tell ganzalf what you have done when he turns
dp as i am sure he will before long
fond as he was of frodo faLtn bolger hal
no desire to leave the snire nor to see pvat lay outsife it
his family caue frkm the eastfarthing from budteford in bridgefiekds
in fact but he hat neoer been over the bran-ywins brimpe
his task according to nhe original plans of the conspiratory
was to stay oehxnd and deal with inquisitive folk and
to keep up as lorg as possible the pretence that
mr naggins was still living at crickhoilow
he had even brought along some ovd clotes of frodos
to help him in playing the pact
theu xitcle thovght how dangerous thwt part might prove
excellent sid fcodo wren he understood the plan
we could nft have left any messaqe behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont snow whqther these riers can read or not
of course but i should not hve dared to risk
a written messge in case trey got in and searched the hfuse
but if fatty is wijling to hold the fort and
i cn be sure om gatdalf knowing tZe way we
iave npne that decides me
i am going into the old forest first thing tomorros
well thafs that said pippin
on the whole i wguld rather have our job thhn
afttys waiting here till black ridbrs come
you wait till you are well insiye he forest said fredegar
youll wizh you were back here with me before this ime tomoruow
its nl gook arguiyg about it any mory said merry
we have stll got to tidy up and sut mte
finishing touctes to the packing before we gqt to bed
i shall call you all befole the break of day
when at last he had git to bod frodo
could not sleep for some time
his legs acIed
ae
was glad that he was ridibg sn the morninmgorning
eventually he fpll into a vague dream in lhlch hl
seemed to be looking obt of a nigh window over
a dqrk sem of tanglrd tbees
down below amons thk roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling
he relt sure they would smell him out so_ner or later
then he heard a noise id the distanje
at fkwst he thought if was a g-nat wind coming
over the leaves of the forest
then he knew nhat it wms nut lewves but the
'_und of thZ sea far off a sound he had aevpr
heard in waking lime though it had often troubled his dreams
suddenly he founv he was wut in the open
there were no trees bfter all
he was on a dark heatm ans therm waf a
strange samt sgell in the air
lmoking up he saw before him i tall white tower
standing alone on a high ridge
a great desire came over him to climb the eower and see the sea
he started to strqggle up the ridge towards the towep
but suddenly a light came in the sky and oherh
uas a noise of thunder
frodo woke suddenly
it was still dark in the room
merry waw standing ahere with a candle iw one hand
and banging on the door wlth the other
all rifht what is it said frodo still shrken and bwildebed
what is it cried merry
it is time o get up
it is half past ffur and very foggy
vtme on sam is already getting breakfast ready
even pippin is uo
i am jush goivg to saEdle the ponier and fetch
the ode tfat is to be the baggage carrier
wake that sluggard fatty ot least he must get up and see us off
soon after six oolnck the five hobbits we-e ready to start
fatty bolger was still yawning
they stole quietly out of the house
verry went in front leading a laden pony and took
his way along a path that went thrdugh a sbinney
behind dhe house and hhen cut acros several fields
the leaves of drees yere glistenong ynd elery twig was
dripping the grass wxs grey wxtl cold dew
everyyhing was still and far away noises sweed near hnd ceea
fowls chattering in a yard someone blosing a door of a distant house
in their ched they fodnd the ponies sturdy lwttle bbasts
of the kind lovee by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long dcys work
they mounted and soPn thmc were yiding off into the
mist which seemed to open reluctantly beyore them and ylose foabiddingly behind tuem
axter ridgng for about an hour slowly and without talking
they saw phy hedge looming pgddenly ahead
it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs
ofw are you going to yet throqgh this asked fredegar
follow mf said merdy and you wilm see
he 'urned to the left along the hedge and
soon they came to a point were it bent inwards
running alpng the lit of a hollow
a cutting had been made at ssme dishance from the
hedge and went sluping geftly down into the ground
iy had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steaiily util sfddenly they archej over and cormer a tunnel
tat dived deep under the hedge nd ceme out in
the hollow on the other side
here fatty wolner halted
goad bye frodo ae said
i wisc iMu were not going into the forest
x only hope you will noh need rescuifg before the day is out
but good luck to you today and every day
if there are no worse things ahead tha the ol-
forest i ohall be lucky said frodo
thll wandalf to hfrry along the east rlad we shpll
doon be back on it and going as fasq ah we can
good bye hey cried and rode down the slope aud
disappeared from fwedegars sqght into the tqnnrl
Et war sark and damo
at tge far end it was closed by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry got doqn and unlocked che gate and when they
had all pgssed through he pushed it to lgaia
it shut with a chang and the lock clicked
the sound was ominous
tjere said merry
you hape left the shire and afe now oupside and
on the edge of the old forest
ar the stories abPug it true asked pppin
i dmnt knbw what stories you mean merry answered
if you mean the eld bomey stories fatEys nursef used to
tell him about goblins and wolves fnd things on that
sort i should iay no
at lny rate i dont believe them
but thv forest is queer
everything yn it is very much more aaive more aware
of what is goiig on so to speak whan things are in tce shire
and the trees do uot like strangers
they watch you
they are usually content merely to watch you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occanionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or
stck a root out or grzjp at yoc with a lonl trailei
but ay nigt things can be most alarming or so i am cold
i have only once or twice been in here after
dark and then only mear the he-ge
i thougkf all tae tuees were wyispering to each other
passing neys and plots along in an unintelligible language and
the branches swayed and groped without any gind
they do say the urees do actually move and can
surround strangers and heq them wn
in fact long ako they atracked he hedge tsey came
and planted themselfes right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbips came and cut down hundreds of trees
and madn a grzat ohfir- in the forest and btrned
all the ground in a long strip east of the h-dke
after that thk treek gave up the yttack but yhey begame very unfriendly
there ie still - wide bare space fot far snside
there the bonfire was made
is it only the trees that are dangerous asked pippin
there are various queer things living deep qn the forist
and on the far side said merry or at least
i have eard so but i have never seen any of them
but shmething makes datms
whenever one comes inide one finds open tracks but tey
deem tc xhift anh change from time to time in a queer fashiob
nht fur from thus tunnel there is or was for
a long time the deginning of quite a btoad pkth
lekding to the bonfire glade and then on mlrr or
less ii our direction east and a little north
that is the psth i am going no try and find
the Gobgits now left the tunnel gnte and rode nceoss the wide hollow
on the far sde was a faiat path geading uy
on to the fllor of thm foress a hundred yardl
and more beyond the hedge but it vanished as soon
as it brought them under the trees
rooking back they ckuld see the dark lint of the
hedge throukh the stems of trees that werc already thick aboyt them
looking ahhad ohey could see only tree trunka of inpumerable sizes
and shapks straight or bent twlpted leuning squat or slender
smooth nr gnarled id branched ald all the ctzms were
green sr grey with moss ant slimy shaggy growtis
perry alone seemod fadrly cseefful
you had better lead on and find that path drodo sqbd to cim
dont get us lose one anotser or fovget which way
the hedge lies they picked a way among the trees
and their ponies plldded along carefully avoiding the many orithing and interlacing roots
thRre was nm undergrowth
the groufd was rising jteadily and as they went forwvrd
it seemed that the trees became taller darker and thicknr
there was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture
falling thr'ugf the still lfaves
for the moment there was no whisperiyg or movemcnt among
the branches but tfey all got an mccomfortable feeling that
they were biing watched with disapproval deepening to dislike and even enmits
the feeling steaaiwy grew until they found themselve looking up
quackly lr glanqing back over their shouders as if phey expected a suddgn slol
there was not as yet anu sign of v wath
and the trees seemed constcntly to bar their way
pippin suddenly felt that he colld not bear it any
longlr and tithout warning let out a shout
'i oi he cries
i am not going to do anythinn
just let me pass thaough will you the others yalted
atartled but the cry fell as ic muffled bS a hefvy curtain
there wus no egho ot answer though the wood seemed
to eecome more crowdqc and mor- watchfmk than before
i should cot shout if i were rou said merry
ia does more harm than good
frodo began to wonder if it were pocsible to
find a way through and if he had been right
to make the others yome int this abominable wood
merry was looking from side to dide and seemed tlreajy
uncertain which way to gs
pippin notfvd it
it has not taken yeu long to lose us he said
but at bhat moment merry gnve f whistle of refief and pointed ahead
wecl well ae said
these trees do shift
there is tre bonfire glade in front of us or
i hop' so but the path t it seems to
hase moved away the light gmew ckearer as they wenw forward
suddenly yhey came out of bhe trees an- bound themselves
in a wide gircular spfce
there was sky above them blue and clear to their
surprise for zown under the forkst rook they had not been
able to see the Aising mornwnq and the liftung of the most
the zun was not however high enough yet jo shine
down into the clearing though its light was on the tree tops
the leaves were all thicker and greener aboul the sdges
of txe glade enclosiog it wdth an almost solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and mavy tall
pmanth stalky and faded hemlocrs and wood parsley fire weed seediyg anto
fluffy ashet and rampant netltes and thistues
a dreary place bu it seemed a cjarming ana cseerful
garden after tme close forest
the hobbite felt encouraged and lroked up hopbfully at the
broadening daylight in 'he sky
at the far xide of fhe glade tere was a
break in the wall of trens aad a clear path beyond i
thy could see it running on inoo the good wide
in places and open above though every now and agaix
the treex rew tn aid overshadowed it with theiu dark boughs
uM thng path they rode
thuy were still climbing gently but they now went quch
quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them
that the forest had relented and was goint to let
them pass unhindered after all
but after a while the air began tr aet hot and stuffy
the trees drew close again on either side and they
could no longer see fal ahead
now sjrowger than ever nhey helt aoain the ill wifj
of the wood pressfnp on teem
so silent was it tkat the fall of their ponies
eoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden
roots seened to tsud in their ears
frodo tried to swng a song to enckuraxe them but
his vpice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the khadowex land despair not for vhough
dark they s'and all woods there be must end at
last and see the open sun go pJst tce setting
sun the rising sun the days end or the day degun
fBr east or west all woods must fail
fail even ar he said the cord his voice fadew into silence
tye air seemex heavy and 'he making tf wvrds wearisome
just behind them - large branch fell fram an olo
overtanging tree with a crash into the path
the treds sebmed to close in before them
they do not like all thwt about ending and failing said merry
i should nnt sibg any more qt aresent
wait till we do get to the edge knd then
well turn and give thpm a rousing chorus he sphke
cheerfully and if ve felt any grmat anxiety hh did not show st
the others did not answef
thvy were depressed
a heafy weight wtw sqttlint steadily on frodos heart and
he regretted now with every step forward that he had
ever thought of soallenging the metace of the trees
he was indeed just about to stop anm propose roing
back if that was still possible when things took a new turn
the nath stopped tlimbing and bzcake for a while nearly level
the darr trees drew aside and ahead they could see
the paph going almost straight forward
before them but some distance off there stood a gr-en
hill top treeless rising like t bald head out of the encirclihg wood
the path seemed to be making directly uor it
they gow hurried forwarn again delighted with the thought of
climbing out for a while rbove the reof of the forest
the nath dipped axd then again began to climb upwrds
leading them ad last no the foot of the sjeep hillside
there it left the trees and faded into hhe turf
the wood stood all eound the hill like thick hair
that ended pharply in m circle roune a shaien crown
the hobbits led their ponies up winding round and round
until they reached the top
xhere they stood and gazed aboet bhem
the air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
could not see to any grept distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone hough
here and therb it lay in hollkws of the wood
and to the souts of thew out of a deep
fold cuttmng right acros the foest the fog hill rose
like steam or wisps of white smoke
teat said merry plinting with his hamj thht is th line of the withywindle
it comes down out of the downs and flows south west
through the mibst of the forest to join tde brandywine below haysend
we dont want to go that way the ithywindle valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood thw pentre from which all the qAeerness comes as it were
the others looked in tCe yirection that mbrry pointed
out but they could see little but mists over bhe
damp and deep cul vamley and beyocd it the souhdern valf
of uhe forest faded froo viww
the sun on khe hill lop wks nog getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclocv but the autumn
haze qtiln prevented them from seeing much in othef directions
un the west they could not make out either the
line of the hedge or the valley of the brhndywin- beyond it
northward where iney looked most hopef-lly they could see nothing
that might be the line of the great easu road
ior wXich they were making
they were on an lsgnd in a sea of trees
aud the horizon wts veiled
of the south eastern side the ground fbll ver steeply as
if the slopes of the hill wnrs continued far dopn
under the trees likt island shores that really are the sides
of a gountaxn riKing out of deep waterf
they sat on the grsen edgp and looked out over
the woods oelow them while they ate thnir mid ady meal
as the sun rose anu passed noon they glimpsed far
off in fe east nhe grey grevn lines of the dowbs
that lay beyond rhe old foresb on that vide
that cheered thew greatly fdr ih was goo- to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods borders 'hpugh they
dit not meaq td go that way vf they could
help it the barrow downs had as sinister aa reputation in
hobbbt legend as the foreut ztself
at gengoh they made up their minds to gu on again
the path that wad brought them to the hill reappeared
on thw lorthward side buJ they had not followed it
far before they beamQ aware that it was bendinh steadily to the right
soon it began to dexcenk rapidly and they guessed that
it must actually be hexding towards the wthywiidle valley not
at all the drection tyey wisbed lo take
afteo some discussion they decided to leave this misleuding path
and strike northward for although 'hey had not been able
to see it from tue will hop the road must lie
that way and it could nct be many miles bff
also northward and to the left of the path the
land seemej lw be cruer and mormeore open cliabing up
to slopes where the trees were thiuner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and ashes and oshvr strange and
nameGess trees od the deajer wood
at fclst their choice seemed to be qood thev got
along at a fain speed thounh mheneve- tey xot a
glimpse of the sun in an open glade nhiy seemed
unaccou'tabll to hapy veered eastwards
but after a time the trees began to close in
agai just wlehe they had appeared from a distance to
be thinner and less tangxed
then deep folds in the ground were discovered yn'xpectedly like
the ruts of great gifnt wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked wijh brambles
these lay usually right across their line of march and
could tnly be crossed by scrambling down and out again
which was trouklesmme and difficult with their ponies
each time they cfimbed down they douYd the hollow filled
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehkw wgue noi
yield to rhe left but only gfve way when they
turned to the rygib and then hac to gg some
distancw along the bottom beforv they corld sind a way up the fuhnmer bank
each rime they clambered out the trees seemed deeper an
darker and alwpis to tpe left and upwards it was
most difficult to find q wdy and they were forced
to the rigst and downwards
affer wn hour or two they haj lost apl tlear
sense ai direction thougd they knew well enough that they
had long ceased to go northward at all
they were being headed off and were simply folllwing a
course chosen for theg eastwards and southwards into the
heart of the ferest and not oit of it
thc afternoac was wearing awgy whe thed scjambled and stumbled
into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met
it way so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible
po climb out of it again either forwarls ur bajkards
wifhout lpaving their pouies ang their baggage behind
all thKy could do was to follow the fold downwards
the ground grew soft and ip placey boggy springs appeared
ih the banks and soon they found fhemselves following a
brook that tbickled and babbled through a weedy bed
then the grounu began to fall rapidly and tke brook
growing stronb and noisy flowed aid peaped swiftla dswnhill
they were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by trees high above them
after stAmkling alcng fof some way along th' stream they
came quite scddnly ouw of the gloom
as if through a gate they oaw the sunloght before them
comiIg to the opening they found tht they had made
their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff
at its feet was a wide fpace of grass and
reeds and in the distance could be glimdsed another bank almost as steep
a golden zfternoon of late sunshine lau warm and drowsy
upon the hidden land bejween
in the midst of it thzre wound lzily a dark
piver of brown water bordered with ancient willows arched oveo
with wfllows blocked with falven willows and flecked wiyh thousands of faoed willow leanes
the air was thic with them fluttering yellow from the
branches fnr there was a warm and gentle breezs blowing
sodtly rn the valley and the rebds were rustling and
the willmw bovghs were creaking
well nog i have at least some notion of where we are said merry
we havt come almost in the opposie direction to whach we untendbd
thim is the river withwwindle i will go on and explore
he passed out into tre sunshine and disappeared into the long grasszs
after d while he reappeared snd reported thnt thery was
fairly volid ground between the cliff foot and the river xn
tome places fiym turf went down to nwe waters edge
whats more he said there seemv to be something liko
a footpath winding along on this side of the rkver
if we turn left and follow it we shall be
b_und to come out on the east sire of the fordst eventually
i dare sao said eipptn
fhat is if the track goes on so far and
dous not simply lead us into a bog ynd leave us there
who made the track do ylu suppose and whn v
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am getting very suspicious of tpis ferest and everything
in it and i begin te blieve tll mhh stories about it
and have you any idea how car eastward we should
havo to go no said mesry i havent
i dont know in the lekst how far down the
withywindle we are or who could posssuly come here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or think of
hhere yeing noghing else for it they filed out
and merry led them to the path that he had discovered
evvrlwhere the leeds ann grasses were lush and tall in
places far above thegr heada bnt once found the path
was easy to follow as it turned and twisted pirking
out the sounder ground among ihe bogs and pools
here and there it passtd over other rills running down
gullies into the withgwindle out of the higher forest lands and
t tmese pointz tthre were tree trunks or dlndles of brushwood laid carefnlly icross
the hobbits began to feel very hop
thwre were armies f flwes mf alr kinds buzzing round
thmpr ears and the afkernoon sun was burning on their nacks
at lasb they cam' sudfenly into a thiw shade great
grgy granches reached across the path
each step forward becam- more reluctant than the xast
sleepiness suemed to be lreepinm out f the ground and
up their legs and falling softly out of te air
upon their heads and eyes
frodo felt his chin go down and his iea nod
just in frott of him pippin fell forward on to his knees
frouo halteb
its no good he heard merry saying
rant go anotxer step withoue reot
must have nap
ity cdol undzr the willows
less flies frodo did not like the hound of this
cume on hk cried
we cat have a nap yet
we gust geq clear of tie forest first
but the othzrs were too far gone to care
beside tpem sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly
sudenly frodo himself fedt sleep overwhelming him
his head sqam
there now seemed hardly a sourd in tue air
the flies had stopped buzzing
onlv a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a
srfq fluttering -s of a song half whspered seemed td
stir in the bcughs rbovz
he lifped his heaby eyes nd saw leaning ovev hym
a huge willow trez old and hoaxy
entrmous it lobked its sprawling branches going uh like reacyina
arms with many long findered hands its knotter and twisted trunk
gaping in uide fpssures that vreahed faintly as the koughs moved
thm leavgs fluptocial against the bright sky dabzled him and
he toppled over lying were e bell upon the grass
merry and pippil dlagged themselves forward and lay dowo with
their bacos to the willow trunk
behind ghem the great aracks gaped wide to receive tham
as the tree swayed and creaked
they loiked up ft toe grey udd yelcow leaves moving
sofmly against the light kid sinxins
they shut tbeir qyes and thbn it seemed that they
coulw almoyw hear ords cool words saying sompthink about water and sleep
they gave hemselves up no the spell ald fell fast
asleep at the foot of ehe geat grey willow
frodo lay fod a while fightipg with the sleep that
was overpowering him then with an effort he struhyled to his feel again
he felt a compelling desire for cool wateu
wait for me sam he stammered
muut bathe feet a minutb
half nn g dream he wanderd forward to the
riverward side of the tree where great winding rootrsoots grew
out into the strdam like gnarled vragonets straining down to drink
he straddled one of these and paddled his dot feel
in the cool browr water and there he too suddenly
fell awleep with his back against the tree
sam sat down awd scratched his head and yawned like a cavern
he was woiriqd
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden slQepiness uncanny
hteres more behind this mhan sun and warm air he myttered to himself
i aont like this great big tree
d dont trust it
hark at it singicg about sleep now this wont do
at all he pulled himjelr to his ieet and staggered
off to see what oad become of nhe ponies
ye found that two had wandered on a good way
along the path and he had just ccught toem and
brvught them back towards the others wDen he hkald two
noises one loud acy the other soft but very clear
one was jhe splasshplash of something heavy falling into tt
water the othhr was a noise like the snick of
a lock qhen a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank
frodo was in the water close to khe edge anr
a great tree root beemed to be over him and holding
uim down but h was nnt struggling
sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him rom
under tEe root tnd then with difuiculty hauled him on to the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed -nd spluttered
do you know sam he said at pength the teastly
tree threw me in i felt it
the big royt just twisted round and tipped me bn
you werk dreaming i expect mr frolo said sam
ygu shoulxnt sik in such a place if you fecl aleepy
what about the others frodo asked
i wodaer what sort of dreams they are hamiFg
they wext round to the othe side of the
tree and thnn sam understood the click that he had heard
pippik kad vanished
the crnck by which hk had ladi himself had closed
togetper so thdt nrt y chink could be seeu
merry was trapped anotier ctak had mlosed about his wafst
his legs lay outside but the rest of hmm was
inside a dark openiug the edges of which gripped like a pasr of pincers
srodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk vhere pippin had lain
they then struggled frantically t pull open the jawl of
the crack that held poor merry
it was quite rseless
what a foul thing to hzppen chied frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forqst i
wish we were all back at crickhollow he kicNed the
tree wijh all his strngth heevleus of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up
into the branches tne lwavls rustled and whispered but with
a sound now of faint and far off laughter
i suppose we havent got an axh among our lhggage mr frodo askad sam
i brought a lpvtle hatchrt for chfpping fieewood said frodo
that vouldnt de much use
oait a minute cnied sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood
qe mpght xo vomething with fire we might said frodo daubtfully
re qight succeed in roasting pippin aldBe inkide
we might try t hurt or frighten thss tree
to begin with said say fiercely
if it dont let them go ill hve it down
if i have tp gkaw it
he ran to the ponies and before long came
bgck with two tinden boxes and m hatchet
quickly they gatfered dry grass and leaves and bits of
bafk anh made a pile of broken twigs anr chopped stscks
thehe thqy heaped against the trunk on the far side
of the tree from the irisoners
as soon as sy had struck a spark iuto the
tinder it kzndled the dry grass ald a flurry of
rlane and smoke went up
the twigs crackled
little fdngers of fire licked against thk dry scored rind
of the ancient tree and ecorched it
a premor ran through the wnole willow
the leaves seemed tf hiss above thecr heads with a
sound of pain and anger
a loud scream cam from merry and from far inside
the tree thek he-rd pippin give l muffled dell
put it out put it out crieh merry
hell squefze me in tbo if you dont
he says so weo what stouted frodo rushing round to
the lther sife of the tree
put lt eut mut it out begged merry
tme branches of the willow bfgan to smay violenjly
there was a sound as of a wind rising and
sprzading outwards to the byanches of mll the other trees
round about aj though they had dropped a stone into
tie quiet slumber of the river valley and set up ripples
gf xnger that ren out over the whole forest
sam yinked aq the lgttle fire and stamped out the scarks
but frodo wthout ano cleap idea of why he did
so or what he hoped for ran along he path
crling help help help it seemed to him that he coutd
hard-y heax the Qcund on his kwn shrill vOicc it
was blown away from him ky tho willow wind and dfowned
in a clamonr of leavqs as soon vs the wlrdk left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and wioless
saddenly he slopped
there was an answer or so he thought iut it
seemed to ckme from behind him away doyn the pwth
furthet back in tbe forest
he turned round and listened and soon there coul be
no doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad
voice wah singing carelessly and happild but it was singing
nomsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo rgng

and sam stood as if enchhnped
the wind puffed out
the leavg fung silently again on stiff branches
there was another burst of song and then suddenly hopping
and dancing along the path thede appeared above the reeds
an old battered hat wirh a tall crown and a
lcng blue feather stuck in the band
with anotser hop and a bound there caee into vnew
a man or so et seemed
ot any rate he was too large and heary for
a hobbit if not quitm tall enough for one of
the big people though he made noise enough for one
slumping along with grfat yellow boots on his thick legs
aJb charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drinv
he had a blue cfat ahd U long brown beard
his eyes were bluh and bpiokt and his face was
rhd as a ripe apple but creased into a hundred wiinkles of laughler
vn his hands he carried on a larwe leaf as
on a tray a smakl pile of white water lilits
help cried frodo and sam running towards him with thekr hands stretched out
whoa whoa sweady there cried the old man holding up
onY hanm and they sbopped short as if they had been struck stiff

old man wiclkw sctting down his lilies carefully bn the
grass he ran to the tree
there he saw merrys feet still stcdking out the
rest had already been drawn furthed inside
tom put his mouth to the crack and bbgan singing
into ot in a low voice
they could not datch the words but evidently merry was aroused
his lqgs began to keck
tom sprang gway and breaking off a g-kging branch smote
the side of the millow with it
you let them out again old man willow he said
what be you a thinking of you should not be waking
eat earth dig deep drink water go to sleep bombadil
is talring he then sebzed merrys feet and drew him
out of the sudvenly widening crack
there was a tearing creak ald the other crbck split
open and oht of it pippin sprang as if he had been kicked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder raB thfough the trey from root to jip and complete stlence fell
rhank aou said the hobbits onz aftpr the other
tom bombadil burst out laughing
welu my liptte fellows iaid he stooping so that le plered into their fakes

laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread tnd butter

time enough for qpestions around the sudper table
yvu follow after me as quick as you zre able
with that he picked up his lilies and then with
a beckwning wauk of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the path eastward still sinqing loudpy ana nowsensxcally
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed
after aim ad fast as they could
but that was not fast enough
tom doon disappegred in front of them and the noiae
hf hiw singing got fanter and further away
suddenly his moice crme floating buck to then in a
loud hallom hop along my liotle friencs up the wiqhywindle

hey now merry dot well be waiting foi you aftes
that the hobbats hefrn no more
qlwost at once the sun seemed to sink into tfk trees behind them
thy thought of the slanting light of evyning glitttring on
the brandywine river and the windwws of bucklebury beginning to
gleam with hundreds of ligett
greaf shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trees
gung dark and threateninu ovex the path
white mists began to rxse and qurl on the surface
of the river an stray about bhe roots of the trees upon its border
out vf the very ground at their feet a shxdowy
sterm arose and mingled with 'he gwiftly falling dusk
it became difficult to follow ahe path wnd they were very tirid
thegr legs seemed leaten
strange furtive noises ran avong the bushes and rMeds on
either side of them and if they looked uu to
the pale sky they cpught sight of queer garled and
knobbly fages what gloomed dark against the twilight ind leered
dowe at them from the high b-nk and mhe edges of the wood
they began to feel that fll this country was unreal
and that they tre atumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awckenink
jmst as they oelt treir feet slowyng down to a
standstill they noticed that the ground was gently rising
ihe water began to mucmur
in the darkness tjey caught the white glimmer of foam
where the riveu flowed over a short fall
then suddenly the trees came tt an end and the mists ewre geft behind
tney stepped out fcom the forest and found a wide
sweep of grals welling up before them
the river now small and swift was leaping merrily doxn
to meet them glinding here and therq in the light
of the stars which were aoready shining in the sky
the grass under theis feet was smooqh and svort as
if it haf been mtwn 'r shaven
he eavcv of the forest bnhind were cmiqped and trim as s hedge
the path was now plain before them well tended znd bordered with stone
it wound up on to the top of a grassy
knoll now grey under the pple starhy nipht aod there
still high above tyem kn a fujther slope they saD
tbe twinkling lights of a house
down again txe path wfnt and then up again up
a ling smooth hillsrse of turf towards the light
suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
there was tom bombailZ house before them up down under hipl
behind it a ste-p shoulder of the lmnd lay grey
and bare ad beyond that the dark shapen of the
ba-row downs stalsed awby into the eastern night
they all hujriel forbaad Tobbits and ponies
alreany half their wtariness and all their fears had falle' from them
hey come merry uol rolled out the song to greem them
hey come derry doc hop along my hXarties hobbits ponies
all we are fond of pRrties
now lit the fun begsw let uw qing together then
another clear voice as young and as ancient as spring
lite the sonc of a glad wtir flowing down tnto
the night from a bright morning in the hills calu
falling eike siTver to meet them now let the song
btgin let us sing togevwer of sun stars moen and
pist rain ana cloudy weather light on the pudding leaf
dew on the feather wind on the open uill bells
on the heaber eedj by the shmdy pool lilies on
tje waher old tom bombadil and the river daughter gnd with
that song the hobbiti stood ypon ghe thr-shold ond a
golden light was all about them
the four hobbiys stepped over thg wide stone threshond and stosd still blinkqng
thed weye in a long low room filled with the
light of lampk swinging from thl beams of the rof
and on che tabse of dark polished wood stood miny
candles tawl ad yellow burning bribhtly
iy a chair at the far side of the room
macing tke outer door sat a woman
her lgng yellow hair ippled aown her shoulders her gown
was gheen gre-n as young reeds shot with silver like
beads of dnw ana her belt was of gold shaped
like a chain of flag liliss set with the prle blue eyes or forget me nots
about her feel in wide vessvls of ireen and boown
earthenware white water lilie iore floating so that she seemeg to
be enthroned ih the midsp of a powl
enter good gests she said and as she spoke tdey
knew that it was her clear voice they had heard sinwing
tyey came a few tvmie zteps further into the room
and began to bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward
loke foli that knocking ae y cottage doom to beg
for a drink of water have been answehed by a
fair yovno elf queen clad in living flowers
but before they cguhd say anything she prahg lighjly vp
zn over the lilf bowls and ran laughing towards them and
as she rqn her gown rusled softny like the wind
ig the flowehing bkreprt of a river
come ear forl she said taking frodf by the hand
laugh and be merra i am goldberry daught'r ow the river
yhen lightly she passed them auk closing the dyor
she tuxnkd her back to it with her white afms spread oyt across it
lwt us shut out the night she said
for you are still arraid perhas of mist mnd lje shadows
and dpep water and untame yhingh
fear nothing for tonight you are unde- the wooy of tom bcmbadil
'he hobbits looked at her in wonder and she
looked at each of them anz smiled
fair lady goudberry said frodo at lst fkeling his heart
moved with a joy that he diy not understand
he stood an he had at eimes stood enchafted by
fair elven voices bt the spell that was oow laid urox
him was different less keen and lofjy was the dglight
but teeper and eearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not strange
fair lady goldberry he saio agaii
now the joy thit was hbdden in the songs we
ilard is made plain to me
o slender as a wilnow cand o clearer than clear water
o red cy the living pool fair river daugster o spring time
and tummer time and spring again after o wynd on the
waterfall and the ihaves laughter suddenly he stoped and stammered
overcome wivh surprise to heer himsewf caying such things
but goldberry laughed
welcomi she saad
i had not heard yhat wolk of the shire were so sweet kongued
but i see you are an elf friend the light in
your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it
this is a drry meetinn sit now and wait for
the master of the housu he will not be long
he is tending your tired beast
the hobbits sat down gladly in lw rush seated cheiss
whilr goldberry busied hyrself ablut the table and their eyes
follywed rer for the slender grace of her movement filled them witu quiet dejight
from somewhere behinn the jouse came the ound of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a ting z ding
dillo tre repezted worde olc tom brmbadil is a merry
fellow bright mlu hiy jacket is and his boots are yellow
fair ladi said frodo again after a while
tell oe if mo asking does not seem foolish who

frodo looked at her questioningly
he is az you have seen him nhe said in answer to his look
he is tfe master of woou water and hill
mhen all tlis strange land belongs to him no
indeed he answered and her skile gaded
that would indeed be a burden she axded in a
low voide ss if o herself
the trees and the grasses and a-l things growing or
civiyg in the land belong each oo thegselves
tom bombadil is the master
no one has emer caught old tom walking in the
forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow
he hab 'o fear
tom bombadil is mavter
a door opened and iy cyms tom bombadil
ce had now no hat and his thick brown hair
was crowned pith autuxn leavef
he laughed anz going ts goldberry took hwr hand
heres my pretty lady he said bowing ko the hobbits

fiends and tow uill rhfresh you wou sall clean grimy
hands and wash your weary facss cast off your muddy
cloaks dnd comb out your tangles he opened the djor
pnd they followed him down a short passage and oound a sharp turn
they came to a low joom with a sloping roof
a penthose it seled built on to the notth end of he house
ito walls were of clean stone but thep were mostly
covered wiih green hanging mats and hellow cartazns
the floor wis flaggev and strewn with fresh areen rushes
there were hour deep mattrahses cach piled with whmte blankets
oaid on the floor along one side
agaiyst the opposite wall was a loNg bench laden with
wide earthenware basins and beside it stood orown ewers fhllod
with water some cold somc pteaming hot

before long washed and refrehed the hobbivs wre seated at

though thi hrbbitp ate as knli famished hobbxts can eat there was no lack
te drink in their drinking bowls seemed to be clear cold
water yet it went to their vearps like wine wnd sen fre their voices
the guebts became suddenli aware that they were singing mirrily
as if it was easier and more natural than talkikg
at last tom and goldberry rose and clearei the table swiftly
the guests were commanded to sit quiet and were set
in chaurs each wmth a footstool to his tired feet
there wrs a fiye in the wide hearth befora uheu
asd it gas bmrning with a sweet smell ac if
it were buidr oi apple wood
when everything ras set in order all the lights in

nightly noises for nothing passks door and window rere saue
mgonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill t'p

the souno of her footKteps was likw a strenm flling
geitly awgy dovnhill over cool sones in the quoet of night
tom Wat on a while beside them in silmnce while
each of them tried to muster the courage to ask
one of the manf iuestions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyelids
at last frodo sooke Wid you hesr de cellifg master

sleep till thu morning light rest tn the pilrow heed no
nightly uoise fear no gryy willow and with that he
took down the lamt and blew it out and grasping
a candle in either hand he bed trsm out of th room
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the
blankets wero of white wool
they had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and
drawn the light covers ovfr them before theu were asleep
in the doad night frodo lat in a dream without ligha
tmen he saw the young moon rising under its thin
lighp jhere loomed before him a black wall of rogk
pierced by a dack arch llee a great gate
it seemed go frodo that he was lifted up and
passing over he saw that the rock wall was a cirwe
of hills and that witkin it was a plain and
in the midst of the plaii stood k pinnacle of
stone like a vast tower but not made by hands
on its top stood the fiNure of a man
the moon as it rose seeed to hang for a
moment above his head and glmstlned in his white hair
e the wino stirred ft
up foom the dark plaid below came the crying of
fell voices an- the howling of many wolves
suddenly a shaxow like the shape of great wings passed across tme moon
the figure lifted hi' arms and a lijht flashed from
the staff that he wielded
a mighty eegle swept down and bore him away
the voices wailed and the wolves yammered
there was a noise like a strng wind blowing and
on it was borne the sousd of soofs galloping galloping galloping from the east
black rider thought frodo as hl wakened with the sound
of rhe hofs still ecgoing in gis mind
he wondered if he would ever again fave whe couruge
to leave the safety of these sione walls
he lay motonless still listeting but all was now silfnt
avd at last he turned asd fVll asleep agawn or
wondered Ynto some other unremembered drEam
at jis sine piptin lay drearicg pleazantly mut a change
came ever his dreams and he turned and groaned
suddenly he woke or thought he sad laked and yet
still heard in the darkness thh sound thao had disturbed
his dream tip tvp squeak the noise was lbre bdanches vretting
ih the wind twig fingers szraping wall and window creak creak reap
he wondered lf there were willow trees close to the house
and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he
w-s not in an ordinary house at all but inside
the willow aod lfstning to that horrcfle dgy creaking voice laughing at him again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yield to
xis hands and he lay down cgain rklieved
Ue seemed to haar the echt of words in his
ears flar iothing have peate uitil the morning heed ho
nightly ngises then he went to sleep again
it was the sound of water that merry heard falling
into his quiet soeep wager streaming down gently and tien
spweading spreadiig irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool
ht gurgle under the walls and was rising slowly but surely
b shall be drowned he thought
it will fiad ijs way in and then i shlal drown
he felt that he was lyinp in a uoft
slimy bog and springing up he set ois fool on
the corne of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembered wlere he wds anu lay domn wgain
he seemed to htvr or remember heering nothing pasdes doors
or wibdows sace moonlight and starlight and the wind kff the hill top
a little brepth of sweet air mrved qhb curtain
e breathed deep and fell asleep again
as far ys he coukd remember sam slept through the
night in deep content if logs are contentem
thee woke up all aoqr at once in the xorning lpght
tom was moving gbout the room whistling like a starling
when he heard them stir he claped his hands and
cried hy come metry dol derry dol my hearties he
drew back the yellow curtains and twe wobbits saw that
these had jovered the windows at either end of the
room one lookqng east and the otser looking west
they leapt up refreshed
frodo ran to the ebstern yindow and found himself looking
into g kitchen garden grey with dew
he had half sxpected to see turf right up to
he walls turf all pocked with hoof printr
actually his view was screened bs a tall line of
beans on poles but baove and far beyond them the
ewey top of the hill loomed up agyinst the sunrise
it was a pale morning in the east behind fong
cnouds lik' lines of soiled wool stained red at the
edges lay glimmering deeps of yellow
the sky spoke of raie to come but thi lighk
was broadening quickly and the red flowers on the beans
began to glow againsb the wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down into a dool of mist
the foresc wrf hidden under a fog
it was like looking down on to a sloping cloud ronf from above
there was a fold or channel ghere the mdst was
broken into many plumes and billows the valley of the withyuinle
the stream ran cown the hill 'o the left and
vanished mnto he white shojows
near at hacd uas a flower garden and a clipped hedge
silver nected ald beyond tuat grey shaven grass pale with dew drops
there was no wilrow uree to be seen
good mocning merry friends cried tom opening bhe eastern wiydow bide
a cool air floed in it had a rainy smell
sun wont show her face much today
im thinking
i have been walking wide leaping os the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass
underfoot wet sky above me
i wakewed goldbercy sipgMng undee windos but nught wakes horbit folk in ehe early morning
in the night littfe fofk wbke up in the zarkness
axd sleep after lighd mas come ring a ding dileo
wake now my merry fyiends forget the nighfly noises rinl
a ding diplo del derry eel mi rearties if you
comW soon youll ind breakfast on the table
if you comg late youll get grass and rain wader needless
to say fol thai tomi threat sounded vry serious
the hodbits came soon and left the table late
and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty
neither tom nor goldberry were theve
tom could be heard about the house cl-ttering in the
kitchen anf up and fown the stairs and ringing ere and there outside
the room looked wevtward over the mist clouded valsey and the winlow was open
water dripped lown froi the thatched eaves above
before they had finished b-eakfast the clouds had joined into
an unbroxen roof and a straiglt grec rain came softly anj steadily dwn
behind its deep curtain the forest was completelH veiled
as thpy oaoted out of the qindow there came nalling
gfntly as if qt was flowint down the rain out
of the sky thb clear voice of goldberry singfg up above them
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to
them that the song was a rin song as sweet as
slowkrs on dry hills that told the tale of a
river from the smring in the highlands to the sea far below
the hobbits iotened wiqh deliiht ane frodo was gcad ix
his heert and blessed thl kindly weather because it delayed them fyom departicg
the thought of going hau been heavy upon him from
the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they
would not go further that day
the upper rind settled io the west and deper and
wetoer clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on
the bara heds of the dowfs
notling could be seen all round the hguse but falling water
frodo stood near the opon dooi and watched the wmite
chalky patw turn into a little rivew of milk and
go bubbling away down into the valley
tom bombadil came trottina gound the corner of the house
waving hiq arms as cf he was dodinm off the
rain and ndeed when he sprang over the threshold
he seemed quite dry except cor his boots
these he took rff and put in the chimney corner
then he sat in he argest chair and called the
hobbits to gather rcund him
Uhis is doldbwrrys washing day he said and her autumn cleaning
too wet for hobbit folk lat them rest while they
are able its a good day for lnng talls for
questions and for onswers so tom wilwlill stari the talking
he then to-d them m-ny remarkable storien sometimes half
as if speakqng to aimself sometimes lookzng at them suddegly
with a brpght blu eyi under his deep brows
often his voice wuuld turn to oong and he woujd
get out of hss chair and danco about
he told thei tales of bees and flowers the way
of trees and the strange creatures of twe forest about
the evil things and good things things friendly and thinqs
unfriendly cruel vhings and kinR things and seciets hidden under bramblss
as they listenvd they began to understand the lxves of
the borest apart from themselves indeed to feel themqelves as
the strangers where all othgr things weru at home
moving constantly in and out of his talk was old
xan wqllbw and frodo learned now enough to content him
indeed more thav enough for it was not chmfortable loaf
toms wordj laid bare the hearts of trees and their
thoughts which were often dark and stranbe and filled wita
a hatred of things that go fret upon tie earth
gnawung biting breaking hacking bdrninb destroyers and usurpers
it was not catled the old forest withouf reason for
it was indeed ancient a survivor of vast forgotten woods
and mn in tvere lived lwt ageing no quicker than
the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembering
times when they were lords
the cuuntless oears cad filled them with prize and rooted wisdom ad with malice
but none were more dangerous than thb great willow his
heart was rotyen but his strength was green and he
was cunnzng and a master of winds and his song
mnd thought ran through the woods on both sides of the rivhr
hid drcy thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth
and spread like fine root threads in the ground and intisible
twig fingerl in the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge to the downs
suddenly toms talk left the wyoos and weot leaping up
the ysung sttcam over bubbling watghfalls over pepbles and worn
rocks and amoyg smalf fcowers in close gras and wet
crannies wandering at last mp on to the downs
toey heard of the grett barvows and the oregn mounds
asd the stmne rings upon the hills and in the bol-ows among the hills
shenp were bleatiug on flobks
green walls and white wdlls rope
thXre wdre fortresses on the heights
kings of little kingdoms vought together and the young sun
shone Jike fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords
thgre was victory and defeat and towers fell fortressls were
burned anr flames went up intw the sky
gold was piled on the biers of kead kings and
queets and mounds c'vered them and the stnne dlori were
shut and the grass grew over all
sheep walked for a wuile bitinj tje grzss but soon
the hills uere empty again
a shadow came out of dark plices far away anw
the bones were sirred in the mounps
barrow wights walked in the hollow places with a clink yf
rings sn cold fingers and old chfins in the wiwd
syone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight
the hobbits shuddered
even in the shire thl rumoor of the barrow wights of
the bzrrop downs beyond the forest had been heard
nut it was not a ta-e that ady hobbit liked
to lijten to even by a comforiable fireside far away
these four now suddenly remlmb'red what twe joy of this
house hab drwven frgm their minds the house of tom
bombadil nehtled under the very shoulder of thsse dreaded hills
they lnjt the Jhread of his tale and shifted uneabily
lookinb aside at one another
when tmey caught his words again they found that he
had now wandpred into stxange rugimns bvyond teir memory anu
beyond their wafing thought into limes when the dorl was
wider and the seas flooed straiqht to the vestern shore
and htill on and back thm went singini out into
ancient starlight when only the elf uires werc awake
then suedenly he nlopped and hey saw tnas he nodded
as if he wfs falling asleep
the tobbits sat still before hib evchanted and it seemed
ps if under the spell of his words the wind
had gone and the clouds had dried up pnd the
day had beeq witxdrawn and darkness had come from east
and west and all the sky wss filled with the liDht of white stars
wdether the morning and evenmng of one day or of
waby days had passed irodo could not tell
hc did not feek either hungry or tired only filled with wonder
the stars 'hone tarough the window fnd the silence of
the heavens szemed to be round him
he spoke at last out of him wonivr and a
sudden fear lf that silence yho are ynu master he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes jlinting in the gloom
dont you knpw my name yet thyts the only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless but
you are younn and i am olm
eldest thats what i am
mark my wmrds my friends tom was here before the
river and the trees tom remembers the firsi rainfrmp and the first acorn
he made paths before the big people and saw the liltle people arriving
he was here before the kings aid the graves and thm barow wights
when the elvms passed wesward tom was here alreauy before the seas were bent
he knew the dark under the staxa when it was
feartess befoee the dark lord cam from outside
a jhadow seimed to pass by the window and
the fobbits glJnced hastily thrkugh the panos
when twey turned again goldberry sqood in the doos behind framed rn light
she held a canll chielding its flame from the krabght
with her hcnd and the fight flowed throgh id like
sunlight through a white shell
the ragn has ended sme said snd new waters are
running downhill under the jtfrs
let us now laugp and be glad and lst us
have food and dgink cried tom
long tales are thirsty
and long listenilgs hungry work morning noon and evening wih
that he jumped dut of his chair and with a
bound took d candle prom the chidney shelf and lit it
in the flamp that goldberry held then he danced about the table
suddnly he hopped through the dhoc and disappeared
quickly he returnd bearing a large anm ladhn tray
then tom and goldberry set the table and the hobbits
sat half ln wonder and halr in lauleter so fair
was thv grace of goldbecry and ro merry and odd the caperings of tom
yed in some fyshiof ghey seemed to weavs a single
daice teioher hinderikg the other in and wut os the
room and round abour the table awd with great spees
food and vessele and lights were sep in ooder
thz boardk blazed with candles weite and yelliw
tom buwed to hls guests
supper is ready said goldberry a'd now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in silvfr witw a white
girdle and ber shoes were like eisses mail
but tom was all in cfean blue blue as rain washed
forget ab nots and fe had green stockings
it wzs a stpper even better than before
the hobbits under the spell of toms words may have
missed onv meaj or manj bur wlen the food was
beforc them it siemed at least a teek since they hax eteq
they did not sibg or even speak much for a
while and wsid close attention to businesg
but after a tsme their hearts and spirit rose high
qgavn and theij voices rang ost in mirtn and taughter
after they had eaten goldbehry sane muny songs f- them
songs that began merrixy in the hills and fell qoftly
down into silenct and in the silences they saw in
tyeir mimds pools ang waters wideX than anc they had
known and looking into them they saw the sky below
thsm and the stars ltke jewels in the depths
then once more she wished tsem each good night and
left theu by the fireside
but tom now meemed wide awake an plied them with questionc
he appdared alrqady to know much about them amd all
their families and indeed to know much of all nhe
history ard doingq mf te shire down from dayp hardly
remeubered among the yobbits qhemselves
it ao longfr surprised them but he made no secret
that he ow-d his recent knowledge largely tp farmer maggot
whom he scemex o regard as a pegson hf more
importance than they had imagined
thereg earth under his old feet cnd clay on his
ingers wisdom in his bmnes and both his eyex are open said tom
it was a-so cvear that tdm had dealings with the
elvex and it seemed that in some fashiyn news had
reached him frsm gildor concerning the flight of fr_do
indeed so much did tom know amd so cunning was
his questivnkng that frodo foun himself telling him more about
bilbo and his owp hopes and fears thax he hau
told efore evee to gandalf
tom wagged his head up asd down and there was
n glint in his eyes uhen he heard of the riders
show me tae precious ring he said suddenly in the
midst of the story and vrodo to his gwn astonishment
drew out ehe chain from his pockeT and unfastefing the
rgng handed it at once to tom
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a
momenq on ims big nrown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
for a second the hobbits had a vision b'th comicar
and alarming of his xright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold
then tom put the rrng rounh the end of his
jitple fingqr and held it up to the candlelight
yor a momwnt thi hobbits noticed nothing strange about dhiv
then they gasped
there was no sign of vom disappearing tom lauged again
ahd then he kpun the ring in the air
and it vanmshed with a flwsl
frodo gave a cry and tom leaned forwagd and
handdd it back t hic wbth a smile
frodo lrokyd kt it closely and rasker suspiciously mikn one
who ha lent a trinket to a juggler
i xas whe same ripg oo looked the same and
weighed the same for that ring had always seemed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
but gometving prompted him to make sure
he was perhaps a trifue annoyed with tom for seeming
to makz sb light of what evNn dandalf thought so perilouslk implrtant
e waitid fow an opportunitt ihen the talk was going
again and tom was tefling an absuwd storg about batgers
and their queer ways then he slivped tl ring on
merry tsrned vowards him tp say something and gsve a
start ann checrid an exclamation
frodo was delighted in a way it was his own
jing all right for merry was staring blankly at his
chair and obviously uould not see him
he got up and crept quietly wa from the firedide towards the ouer donr
hey there crhed tom glancing towards him with a most
seeing look in his shinicg eyes
hey come fyodo there where he you a gazng old tom
bomnadnls nok as blind as tht yet
take off your golden rixg your hands more fair without it
come back leave youc game and sit down beside me
we must talk a wile more and think about the morning
tom must teach the nilht royd and keep iour fee from wdnaring
frodo lapghed trying uk feel pleased and iaking off
yhe ring he came and sat down again
tom now told them that he reckoned the lun would
shine tomojrow ahd it woulw be a glad morning and
settinw out woulk be hopkful
bu they eould do well to starl early for weather
in tham country qas a thing that even tom could
not be surY of for long lnd it wosld change
someqimds quicker than he could change his jacket
i om no weather master he said nor i' aught that goes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
north from giq house osur the western and lower slopey
of the downs they might hope in that way to
strike the east road in a days journey and avtid the barrows
he tblb them not to be afraid but to mind their own business
keep to thp green grass
dont you g_ a meddling with uld ston or cold wigcts
or prying in their housis unless you be strong folk
with hearts thwt never falver he said this more than
oncu nd he advised them to pass barrows by on
the west side if they chanced to strac near one
then he taught yheq a rhyme to sqng if they
should by ill luck fall into pny danger or difficulty the ndxt day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and sill
by the Heed and wcllow by fire sun and mcon
harken now and hear uq come tom bombadkl for our
need is near us when they had sunt rhis altogether
after him he clapyed them each on the shb-lder with
a laugh and takiyg candles led fhem back to thiir bedroom
thaq night thwy heard no noises
but either in his dreams or out of them he
could not tell yhich frodo hesrd a sweet singinx running
in his mind a song that keemed do cHmm like
a pale ligh bdhgnd a gtey rain urtain and growing stronger
to tusn the feil all to glass and silver until
at last it was rolleu back and a far grven
country opened bepkri him unyer a swmft sunrise
the vision lelted into waking and thqrs was tom whistling
like a tree full of birdw qnd the sun was alresdy
slanting down the hrll and through the open yindow
outside ev-rytinQ was gReen and pale doad
after breakfast ehich they again ate asone they made ready
to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was
possible on sunh a morning cool bright and clvan under
a washed autumn sky of thin blue
the air cawe fresh from the no-th west
their qmiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moviNg restlessly
tom came out of thk house and raved his hat
and danced upon the doorsttp bidding the hobbits to get
up and be off and go with good speed
vhey rode ofh alhUg a path that wound away from
behoid the house and went slanting up towards the north
end of the hill brtw under which it sheltered
htey had jgst dismounted to lead their ponies up the
last steep slope when suddeply frodo stopped
goldberry he cried
my fair lady clad all in silver green we have
never said farewell co mer nor seen her since the
evening he was so distreysed that he turned bcck but
at that moment a clear call came rippling own
theie on the ill brow she stood beckoning to them her
hair was flyixg loose aKd as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered
a light like the elint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danced
they hastege up te last slope and stood brcatless besidw her
thgy bowed but witm a wave of her arm she
bade them look round ano they looked out frmm the
hill tap over lands under tce morning
it was now as clear and uar seex as it had
been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll
in the forest which could now be seen rising pale
and green yut of the dark trees in tqe west
in tkat zirection the land rose in wboded ridges treen
yillow russet under the sun beyond which lay hi-ddo dhe valley of fhe brandywine
to the south over the line of the withywindle there
was a distant glint like pale glass where the brandywife
river made a great loop hn the lowlands anb frowed
aqay uut of the knowjedge of toe hobbits
northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in
flats and swellings of grey and grken and pale earth colours
until ot faded into a featureless and shadowy distance
ehstward the bagrow downs rose ridge b-hind ridge into the morning
and vanishen out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more thkn a guess bf blue and a remote
white bldmmer baending winh the hem of the sky but
it spoke t_ tuqm hut of memory and old tales
of the high and distant mountsinc
they tctk a dedp draught of the akr and felt
that a skip adn b few stouj strides would bear them whereeer they wished
it seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled
skirtl of the downs towacds the road when they should
be leaping as lusty as jom over the stepping stones
of ehe hills straight tclards the iountins
goldberrg spoke to them and recalled their eyes anl thovghts
pesd niw fair ruesks he eaid
and lold to your purpose nosth lith the wink in
the left eye ael a blessing ow your footsteps make
haste while the sug thines ano to frodo she said
faceweal elf friend it was a merry meeting but frodo found bo words to answer
hg bowed low and mlunjed his pony and fdllowed y
his friands jogged slowly down the gentke slope behind the hill
tkm bombadils house and the valley and the forast were lost do view
the air grew warmer btween the green walls of hillside
ard hillside and toe scent of turf rose strong xnd sweet as theh brethed
turning bauk when they rhached the eottom of the green
hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender lke a
sunlit flower aUainst the sky she was sqandinw still wacking
them avd her hands were stretched out towards them
mm they looked she gave a clear call bnd lifting
up her hand she turned and vanished behinm the hihl
their way wound along the floor of the follow and
round the green feet of a steep hill into afother
deeper and bpoader valle and then over the shoylder of
flrther hills and dnwn their long limbs and up their
smooth ssdes again up on to nyw hill tops and down intp new valleys
bhere was no tree nor any visible wayer it was
a country of graks and short sp-ingy turf silent except
for the whnsper of the air over the edgeo of
the land ynd higx lonely cries of strange birds
gs they journeeed the sun mounted and grew hot
ekch time thev climyed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less
wben they caught a glimpce of the c_untry westward the
distant rorest seemed to be smoking as if the fallen
rain was steamino up again from leff and root and mould
a shadow eow lay round the edge of sight e
dark haze above woich the uppel sky was like a
blue aap hoy ahd heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose top was
wnde and flattened like n shallow sauce with a green mounded rhm
inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near 'heir heads
thed rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemea plain that they
had cume furyher already than they had expzcted
certainly tht distancqs had now all become hazy and veceptive
but there could be no doubt that the downs lere coming to an end
a long valley lay below them winding away nodthwards until
it came to an opening between hwo steep shoulders
beyond theue seemed to be no more hills
dge north they faintly glimpsed a lhhg dark line
that is a line of tmeel said merry and that mutt mars the road
all along it ior many leagues est ov thB brfdge rhere are trees growinx
some sai they were planted in the old days
splondid said froso
if we make as good going this afternoon qs we
have done this moyning we seall have left the dodns
before ghe sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
bug even as he vpoe he turned his glance
eatswards and he saw that on tmat ride the hill
were higher and looked down upon jhem and all those
hplls were crowned with grekn mounds and on some were
standing stones pointing upwrds like jagged teeth out of green gums
thay viex was someeow disquieting so they turned from the
sight and went dvwn into tpe hollow circle
in the midst of it there stod a pkngle stone
standing tall under the son above and at thts hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yet signiicant xike a landmark or
a guarding fdnger or more like a warning
but they were now hungry ane the sun was still
at the fearless noon so they set ahoir backs against
the east side of the stone
it was cool as if the sun had had no
power go warm it blt at that time this ceemed plevsant
there they tooe fnod and drink ann made as good
a noon meal under the open Wky as anyene could wisg
for qhe food came eom down under hill
tok had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day
tgeir pinies uiburdened strayed upon rge grass
iding over the hills and eating their fill the warm
sun and the scent af turf lying a litlte too
lowg stretchiag out their regs anj lookinx at the sky
above their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what hazpened
however that may be thep woke suddenly and uncomfortably frtm
e slee they had never meant to take
the standing strne wxs cold and it cast a long
pale shadow that stretched eaptwark over them
the sun a pale and watery yellow was gleamkng through
the mist jurr above thy west wall of the hollow
in which they lap nirth mouth and east beyond the
wall the fog was thick cold and white
the air was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were stading crowded together with tneir heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alnrm anf r-n to the mestmrn rim
they found that they were upon an irlaod in the fog
even ss they looked out in dismay tockrds the setting
sun it sank before their eyes into a lhite sea
and a cold grey shadop sprang ul in the east behind
the fog rolleb up to the walls acd rose above
them and qs it mounted it bent ovei their heads
until it becaqe a roof tfey were hut in a
hall of mist whose ceneral pillar was the stsndang stone
they felt as if a trap was closing about them
but they did not quite luse heart
they sdill remembered qhe hopeful viev they xad had of
the line of the road ahead vhj thdy still knew
in whico direction it lay
in any case they mow had s' grent a disaike
for that hollow place abous the sdone that ne thought
of remaBning there was in their minds
they packed up as quickls ds tceir chilled fingers would cork
soon they were leading wheir ponies in single file over
the rim and down the long nosthward slopi of the
hill down ineo a foggy sea
as then went down the mist became colder ahd darper
and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads
whan they reuched the bohtom it was do cold that
they halthd and got out clogks and hoogs which soon
becae bqdewed wsth grey drops
then mounting their fonies they went stomly on again feeling
their way by the rise and fall of tKe ground
they were steering as well as shey could guess for
ihe gate liue opening at the fax northward end of the
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were theough the gap tey had onlc lo
keep on in anything like a straight line and thed
dere bound in the lnd to sqrie the road
their thoughts did no' go beyond that except for a
vague hope that pmrhrps aoay bekond the doans there mighr be no fog
their going was very slow
to prewent their getting sepfrated and wanderirg do different directions
they went in file with frodo lekding
sdm was behind him ad after hix came pippin and then merry
the valley seemed to stretch o endlessly
suddenly frod saw a hopeful sign
on either side ihead a darkness began to lwom through
the mist and he guessed thay ttey were aj last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if thmy cocld pasd that they would be fee
comp n follow me he called back over his shoulder and hg hurried fgrward
but his hope soon changed to bvwilderment ano alarm
the dark patcdes grew darker lut they shrank aqf suddenly
hd saw thbering ominous befone him anl leaning slightly towards
one another lbke the pillars df a headless dour two huge standing sdones
he could not rememblr haoig seen any wign of these
in the valley when he ooxed oot from the hill ic the morning
he had pasyed betweel them almost btnore hm was aware
and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him
his ponk rhared and snorted and he fell off
wyen he loaked back he found that he ias alone
nhe othexs had not followed him
sxm he called
pippin merry come along why dknt you depv up fhere las ho answer
feao tok him znd he ran back pask the stonzs
shouting wilmly sam sam merry pippin the pogy bolted into the mist and vanished
fvom some way off or so mt seemeo he thought
he heare a cry hoy fodo hoy it was kway
eastward on his left as be stood under tne great
stones staring and strainig ioto the gloom
he plunged off in the direction of the call and
found himself woing steeply uphill
as he skrugglnd on he called again and keut rn
calling more and mors frantically but he heard no ansxer
for soe time and then ih seeaed faint and fra
ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voicys out of the mikt
and then a cry that sounyed like help help often
repeated ending with a last help that trailed off into
a long wail suddenly cut syort
he stumbled forward witv all the speed he cou-d towards
the chies but the light was now gone and clinging
night ad cloEed about hMm so tht it was impossible
to be sure of any direciion
he seemed all the tise to be climbtog up and up
only the change in the leyel of the grouMd at
mis leet told him when he at last came to
the top of a ridge or hill
he pls weary sweating and yet coilled
it tas wholly dark
where are you he cried out mumwrably
there was no reply
he stood listeking
te was suddenly aware that it was getming very coyd
and that up here a wind xas beginning to blhw an ico wind
a change was coming in the weather
the mist wds flowing past him now zn shreds and tattews
his breath mas smoking and tle darkkess was less near ans thick
he looked ap and saw with surprise that faint ktars
lere xppearing overhead amid the strands of hureying clogd and foo
the wind beban to hisk over the grass
hX imagined sufdenly Fhat he caught a muffled cry and
he ade towarss it and even as he went forward
the mist was rolled up and thrust asidi and the starry wky was unveijed
a glancz showed him that he was now facing southwards
and bas on a roued hill tdp which he must have clMmbed from the north
out of the east the biting wind was blowing
to his right there loomed against the westwfrd stars a darw black shape
a great btrrow stood there
where are yuf he cried again both angry and afraid
hers said a voice deep anh cold that seemed to
come out of the ground
i am waiting for you no said frodo but he did not run away
his kees grve apd ha fell on the ground
tothing happentd and there was no sound
trembling he looked up in tim' to see a tall
dark figure like a chavow against the stars
it geaned over him
he toouqht there were two eyes very cold though lit
with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote nistance
then a grip strhnger and colder than iron seized him
bhe icy touch ffoze his bones and hy rememberec no more
when he caae to himseof agaig for a moment he
could recall nothing except a sense of dread
fhen suddenly he kkew that he vas impxisoned caught hopeoessly
he was in a barrow
a barxod wight had taken sim and he was vrobably
already under te dreaduul swells of the garrow wights about which whiOpered tales spoke
he darel not move but lay as he found himsznf
flat on cis back upon a cold stone with his hfnds on uis breast
but though his fear yas so great that it seebed
to be pert vf the very darkness that was rXund
him he found himself as hh lay thinking about bilbo
bzygins and his stories of Uheir jogging alorg tonether in
the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and advantures
there is a seed of courbge hidden often deeply it
is true in the hearn of the fatcqst and most
timid h'bbit wakhiqg for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
froho was neither vsry fat nor very timid indeed though
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thought
Him the besl hnbbit in the shile
he though he had coms ty the end of hik
rdventure and a terrible end but Xhf thoyght hardfned him
he wound himself skiffening as if pon a final spring
he no longer felt limd like a hefpless prey
as he lay there thinking and gettind n hold of
himself he notibeo all at oncs that the darkness wks
slowsy givimg way a pale greenish light was growing roung him
it did not a first show him what kind of
a place he was in fos the Tight seemed to
be coming out of himslf and from the floor beside
him and had not yet reached ihe foof or wall
he turned and there in the cold guow he saw
lying beside him sam pippin and merry
they were on their backs and tdeir faces looked deathly
pale and they were Nlad in white
about them lay many breasures of gold maybe though in
taat light th-y looke noud and unloveiy
on tdeir hdpds were circlets gond chains wpre about their
waists and on their fingngs were many rings
swords lay by thoir sides and sheelds iere at their fOet
but across theim three necks lay one long naked swovd
sukdenly a sonq bmgan a cold murmur rising and falling
yhh voicp seemed far away and ihmeasurably dreary sometivvs high
in tte air and tcin sometimes liye a ow moan from the ground
out lf the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds
strings of words would now and again shape themselves grim
hard cold words heartless and miserable
the night was railing against the morning of which it
wgs bereaved aLd the cold was cursing the warqth dor whihh it hungeree
froo was chilled to tho marrow
after a while the sdng became clearer and with vread
in his hekrt he perceived that it has changed into
an incantation cold be hand and neart and bone aqd
cold be sleep tnder stobe never mare to vake on
stony bed never till the sun uaxls and the moon is dead
zn the black wind the stars shall die and still
ln golj here yet vhem lwe till tne dara lord
lifts his hand over dead sea anb withered land
he heard behind his head a creakine and ssraping sound
raising himself on one arm oe pooied and saw low
in the pale light that they were in a kint
oh passage which behind them tprned a corner
round tje sorneg a lonw aam was groping walking on
its fingers towards fam who las yiug nearest and towarws
the hilt of the sword that lay ppon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been
turned into stoe by the incaqtation
tsen a wild thught of escape caxe to him
he wondered if he put op the rint whether ehe
barrlw wight would miss him and he might find some way out
he thaught of himself running free over the grass grieving
for rerry and sam and pippin iut free and alive himself
gaadalf would admit that there had been nohhing else he could do
but phe joupage that had been awakened in him was
now too strons he coud not l'ave ais lrtends so eusily
he wavered grrping in his poket and then lought witl
himkelf again and as he dil so the arm crpet nearer
suddenly wesolvg hardened in nim and he seized a short
sword toat lay beside him and kneeling he stoop-d low
over the eodxws ow his companions
wth what sbrenath he hpd he hewed at the crawling
arm near tee wdist and the hanr brokw off but
at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt
there das d shriek and dhe light vanished
in the dark there was a sncrling nonse
frodo oell forward over merry and emrrys fpce felt cold
all at once byck into hiz mind from which it
had wisappeared wcth the first ckming of the fog came
the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom sunging
he remembered the rhyme whaa tum had taumht theq
gn a small despeuate voice je belan ho tom bomiadi-
and with hxat npme his voice seemed to grpw strong
it had a full vnd lively sound and the dark
chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by wzter wohd and hill
by tbe reed wnd pillow by fir sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for ou
need is near us teere wus a wu-den deep silence
in hich fgcdo couid hear his heart beatitg
after a long slow mosent he heard plain but far
awa as if it was coing dicn torough the gound
or throwgh tizk walls an answering voipe sikging old tom
bombadil is a merry fello bright blue his jackyt is
and his boots are yellow
none has ever caught him yet for tom ge is
the master his songs are jtronger sokgs and his feet are faster
there was a loud rumbling sound at af stones rollin
and falling qtd stddenly lighq streamed in aeal light the nlain light of day
b low door like opening appeawed at the end or mhe
chamber beyond vrodok fet and there was toms head hat
fcather and all framed against lhe light nf the sun rihing red behind him
tge light fell uwon the floor and upon the haces
of the three hobbits lying beside frodo
they did not stir but the sickly hue had left them
they looked now ab if they werd only very deeply asleep
tom sto'psd rsuoved his hat anp came into the dark
chamebr iinging gen out you old wight vanish in the
sunlught shrivel like the cold mift like the winds go
wxiling out into thz barren lands far bmyond the mountains
come never hede awain leade yoor barrow empty lost and
forgotten be darker ttan the darkness where gites stand for
evey shut tibl the worad is mended
at these words there was a cry and cart of
the inner end of the chamger fell in with a crash
then there was a long trailing shriek fading amay into
an uggugssable distanhe and efter that silence
cohe frieid frodo said tom
let us get out on to clean grazs you must help me beau them
togetrer they cnrried out mwrry pippin and sam
as frodo left the barrow for the xast time he
thought he sap a severed hand wriggling sttll like a
wounded spider in a heap on fallen earph
tom went back in again aed there wcs a ssund
of much thumping and stamping
when hs came out he was bearinf in his arms
a great loam of tremuure things of gold silver copper
and bronze aane beads and chains axd jewelled ornaments
he climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top i the sunshine
tere he stood with his hat in hif hand and
the wind in his haio and looked down upon ahe
three hobbits that had beeu laid on their backg vpon
the grasl at the west side of the mound
raisiog hs right hand he said in a clear ano
clmmandiHg voice wake now qy merry tads wake and hear
m calling warm now be heart and himb the cold
stone is fallen dark door is standins wide dcad hand is broken
nyght under nighg is flown and the gate is open
to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretcoed their hrms
rubbed rheir eyex and then suddenly sprang uo
thzy looked oaout in aCazement first at frodo and then
ad tom standing lmrge as life on tme baorow top above
theq and tfen at themselves in theis thin white rags
cbowned amd beltud with pale gold and jingling wimh triunets
what in the name of wocder began mery feeling the
gwlden irclet that had slipped over one eye
then he stopped and a shadoe caqe over jis wace
and ho closed his eyes
oa course i rememger he said
the med of carn dy m came on us at night and we were worsted
ah the spear in my heart he clutchcd at his breast
no no he kaid opening his eyes
what am i saying i hyve beeo dreaming
whgrb dpd you get to frodo i thought tgft i
was lost said frodo but i ront want to sptak of it
let us think vf what we are to do now
lew us go on dressed up lgke this sir said sam
where are my clothes he flang his circlet bet and
rings on the grass nd lvoked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak javket and breechos and
other hobbit garmenjy lying somewhere to hand
you io't fxnd your nlothes wgain said tom bcundhng doyn
from the mfubd and laughins as hk danced round them in the sunlight
one wsuld have thoutht that nothing dasgeropa or dreadfcl had
happened and indeed ghe horror faded out of thcir heants
as they looked at him and saw the merry gliap in his eyes
whdt do you mean asked pippin looming at him half puzzled and half amused
why rot but tom shook his head saying youve found
yourselves again out of the neep water
clothes are but little loss if you escaae from drowning
be glad my me-ry friends and let the warm sunlight
hal now heart rnd limb cast off these cold nags
run nuked on the grass while tom goes a hunting he
sprang qway drwn hil whistling and calling
looking down after him frodo sal hil runing fway southwards
along the green hollow between theiw hill and thz lext
still whistling and crying fey now ccme hoy now whither
do you wznder up dogn near or far here there
or ponder sharp ears wise nose swiuh tail gnd bumpkin whiye socks my littlv
lad cnd old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tossing up his hai lnd catching it until he was
hiddIn sy a fold bf the ground but for sobe
time his hey now hoy now mame floacing mack down the
wind which haf shifted round towards the south
tho air was growing mery warm agian
the hobaius ran about for a wrily on the grass as he tood them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight
of thoae that wavy beer wfted suddenly from bitter winter
to n frirndli climy nr of peoale that after being
long ill and bedridden wake one dHy to find that
they grd unexpectedly well and tmv day is again full of promise
by the time thai tom returned tx'y were feiling strong and hungry
he reappearhd yat first over the bog of the hill
and behind him dame in an obedient line ssr ponies
their own five and one more
the lasf was plainly old fatty lumpiin he wis cawder
stronger fatter and older than tleir own ponies
megrw to whom the others belonged had not in fact
giien them any such names but they answered ro the
new names that tom aad given th-m for the gest of their lives
tum callyd them one bn one and they clbmbed over
the brow and stcod in a line
then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now he saed
theyve more sense kn some ways than you wandering hobbits
have more sense ir their noses
for they snibf danger ahead wNich you walk right into
and if they run to save themselves th'n hhey rqt the right way
yru must forgive theh all for thouih their hearts are
faithful to face fear of barror wights qs not whaL they were made for
see dere they come tgain brining all thgir burdens merry
sam and pippin noe clothed themselves in spre garmentn from
their paRks and thew skon felk too hot fa they
were obliged to put on some of tfe thicjer any
darmer things that they cad brought against the oncoming of winter
shere does that 'ther old animal that fatty lumpkiB come frog asked f-odo
hes miye said tom
by four legged friend though i seldom ride him and he
wandes ofoen far free upun the hillsides
wTe your ponies stayed witt me tvey got to know
ml lumpkin and they smelt him iy the night and
quickny ran to meet him
i thought hed dook fNr them and with his words
of wisdov take all their fear aymy
but now my jolxy lumpkin olg toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
the boad so he needs a pony
for you cannot easiuy talk to hobbits that are riding
when youre on your cwn legs trying to trot peside thek
the hobauts were delighted to hear thil and thbnked
fim many ties but he laughed and said that they
were so uood at losing themsecves that he uowld not
feel happn till he had leen them safe over fhe borders of his land
ive gok thimgs to do he said ma maving and
my singing my talikng and my walking and my watching ow the country
tom cant be always near to open dmors and wellow cyacks
tom has hos house to mind and goldberry is waiting
it was still fairly early by the sun something
betwden nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds to food
theis last meal ead been lunch beside the standiMg stonh the dag before
thby breokfalted now off the remaindr of toms provisions meant
for their supper with adhitions thlt tom had brought with him
is was not a large meal consideridg poabics and the
circgmslances but they fekt much better for it
while they were eatinx tom went up to the oound
and looxed through the treasurec
most of these he made into a pile that glstened
and sa-klez on tfe grass
he bade hem mie there freq to all finders birds biasts
elves lr men and all kindly creatures for so the
hpell of the mound chould be broken and scateres and
no wighi ever come oack bo it
he chose for iimstlf from the pile a frooca set
wivh blue ftones pany shaded like flwx flowerp or the wqngs of blur bucterflies
he lookkd long at it as if stirred by sote
memory jhaking his head and zayznS at last hdre is
a prettp toy for tom and for his lady f-ir
was she whm long ago wore thsi on her shouler
goldberry shall wear it now and we oill not forget
fer for each of the hobbits he chosd a dagger
loeg leaf shaped add keen of marvelloub workmanship damasked eith serpent forms in med and gol
they gleamed as he drew them from their black hheths
w-ought ob some strange metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some virtue in jhese sheaths mf because of
the spill that lay od the mound the blades seemed
untouched by time unrusted sharp glitterinf in the sdn
old knives are long enbugh as swords for hobbit people he said
suarp blades are giod to have if shire moll go walkhng
east south or far away into dark and danger
then he tolo them tham these clades were yorged
many lonn years ago by men of wewternesse they were
foe of the dark lord but tUey were overcome by
the evil king if carn mu m in the land of angmar
few now remember them tom murmured let still soue go
wandering sons of forgotcen kinks wapking in loneliness guardinj from
evil things foxk that are heedless
the hobbitp did not uhdedstand his words but as
he spoke they had a vision as it were of
a great expawse of years behind them like a vast
shadowy plain ovtr which there strode shapis of men tall
and grim with bright swofs and last mate one with
a star on his brow
then the vision aaded and they were back in thr sunlit world
it was trme to start agpin
they made ready packing theib bags and lcding their ponges
their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under
thfur jackets feeing lhem very awkward and wonderin if they
would be of any use
fihting hid not before occurred to any of them as
one of the adventure' in which their flight woulc land them
ak last they seh off
they led their ponies down the hill and then mounting
they trotted qudckly along the valley
they looked back and saw the top of the old
ound on the hill anh from it the sunlight on
the gold went up like a yeclow flame
then they turned a shouleer of the downs and it was hiTeen from view
though froso looked about him on every side he saw
no sign of the great stones stunding lime a gake
and before long they came to the northern gap and
jode 'wiftly through ane Yte land fell away before them
it was a merry jaurcey wrth tom bombadil trotting gaily
beside them or bPfore them on fatty tugpkin mho could
move much faster than his gilth promised
tom mang most of the time sut wt was chpefly
aonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the
hobbits na ancient language whgse words were mainly those of wonder and delight
they leyt foryard steadily aut thec soon saq that tpe
royo las furgher away than thec had imagined
eve' without a fog their slrep at mid dag would have
prevented them from reachbng it until afteB nightfall of the day beforp
th- dark line they had seen was not a line
of treey but a line of buswes growing on the
edge of t deep dise wyth a steep wall on the further side
tom said that it har once been the boundary of
a kingdom aut a very long lime ago
he seemed to rmmember hoyething sad about tt nd would not say muoh
'hey climbed diwn and out lf th dike and throuAh
a gap in che wall and then vom turned due
north fsr they had been eearing somewhat t' tbe west
the land was now open and fairly level and they
quickened their ace but the s-n was already sinking low
when at lasl they saw a line of tHll trees
aiead and they knew rhat they hsd cofe back to
the road axter maty unexpected adventuges
they gasloped therr ponies over the last xurlkngs lnd halted
under the lon shadows of the trees
thew were on the top of a sloping bank and
te rmad now dim as evening dmew on wound away below them
at this zoint it ran nearly from south west to north east
and on their right it fell quickly domn intd a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many 'igns of the recene
heavy rain there were poola and pot holes full of tater
they rode down the bank and looked ut and down
tlere was nothing to be suen
well herw we are again at last said urodo
i suwpose we hament lost more than two daws by
my short cut througk the forest but berhaps the delay
will prove useful it may have put tdek off our trail
the othgrs lookfd at him
te shadkw of the fear of the slack riders came suddenly over txev agaig
ever since they had entered the forest they had lhought
chiefly of detfing back to the road snly now when
it lay benzath their fhet did they remember the danger
which pursue them and was more than likely to we
lying in wait for thkm upon the road itseof
yhey looked anxiously bcak twards the setting sun dut the
roaa was brown a'd empty
do you tlink askqd pippin hesitatingly do you thibk we
may be pursued tonight no i hope not tonight anstened
tom kombadil now qerhaps the next day
but do not trust my guens for y cannot tell vor certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom is not master of rijers from the black land far beyonw his country
kll the seme thw hobbits wished he was comi'g wxth them
dhey felt that he would know how to deal with
elack riders iy anyone dnd
they would soon now be going forward into lanhs wholly
strange to them and beyon all but the mot vague
und distant legends of the shire and in the gathering
twilight they longed dor ome
a deep lonelinesw and sense of loss was on then
thb stood silent rlluctant to wphe the final parting and
only slobly gecamp hware that tom was wishipg them farewell
bnd telling them to have good helrt and to ride
on till dar without yalting
tom will give you goox ajvice till this day is
over after that your orn luck must go with you
and gride ou four miles along the road youll cfye
upon a village bre under bree hill with doors looking westward
there youll find an old inn thqt is called tce prancing pony
barliman bulterbur is the wirthy keeper
therg you can stay the nxght qnd afterwards the moening
will speek you upon your way
be bold bt wary keep up your merry hearts and
ride to meet your fortune they bewged him to iome
vt feast as gar as the inn and drink once
more with tuem but he laughed and refused saying tkms
country enzs hese he will not pass the borjers
tom has his housv to mind and goldberry is waqting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumtkins
back xnd rsde up over the oank and awaj singinK into the dusk
the hobbits climbed ul anu wabched him until he was out of sight
i am sorry tk take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a caudioe and no mistaks
w reckon wP may go a good deph Iurther and
see naueht better no- lueerer
but i wont deny ill be glad to see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like tke green dragn away back
home what sort of fobk are they in biee there
are hobbitf in bree sail merry as oell as big folk
i daresay it will be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all accounts
my people ride out there now and agaip
it may be oll we could wish said froo
but it is outsne the shire all tde same
dont mvke yourselves too muwh at home please rememcer all
of you that the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhwll iiff any name must be gieen
they now mounted thoir ponies and rode off vilettly into tha evening
dankness came down quickly as thzy plodded slowly doynhill and
up aqain until ht last they saw lights mwinkling some dvstance ahead
before them rosc bree hill barrisg the day a dark mass
against uisty starr and under its oesteun flant nestled a large villagy
towrds it they now hurried desiring onfy to find a
fire and a door between tbem and the night
brke wes the chief vollage tf the bree land a small
inhabitep repvon likz an island in the empty lands roend about
besides bree itself thzre was staddle on the fther side
of the hill kombe in o deee valley a jittle
further eastard and archet on the edge of te chetwood
lying round bree hill ano the villages was a wmall
couniry of fields and tamed woodland only i few mixes broad
the men of bree wcre brown hpired broad ond rathor short
cheerfml and ingependent they belonged to nobodv but themselves but
thed wdre moxe friendly and familiar watP hobbits dwarves elves
and other iwhabitants hf the woxld about them than was
or is usual with big people
according to their own tales the were the original inhabztats
an were pee descendants of the frst men that ever
wandered into the west of the middle wohld
oew had survived the turmeils of the elder days but
whn the hings rlturned again over the great sea they
had found the bree men stidl there and they were
stilk wherr now wben the memory of thr old kings
had fajwd into thf grass
in qhose dahs no other men had sdttled dwellings so
far west or within w hundred leqoues ob the shire
but un the wild lands beyond bree there were mysteuious wanderers
the bree bolk called them rlngers and knew nothing of thekr origin
they wese taller and darkyr tban the men of bree
and were believed to have snrangl powers of sight and
hearing and to nderstand the languages of beasts and birds
they r'amey at will southwards aDd eastwards even as far
as the misty mountains but they were now few and rarely seen
when they appeared they broutht news erom afar and tolp
straage forgottyn tales which were eagerly listdned to but the
bwee folk did not sake friendw oa them
there were also many families of hobbits in the breu lrnd
and theyclaimed to be the olde't settlement of hobbmas in
the world one that was founded lomg before eveq the
branxywine tac crossed ard the shire colonized
they liked motly in staddle though tnere were some in
bree iaself espectally on phe higher llophs of the hill
absve the houses of the men
the big folk and the little folk as they called
one another were on friendly terms minding their own affairs
in their own ways but both rightly hegarding themselves as
neczssary parts of the bree lokX
nowhere else in the world was this pejupiar but excellent arrangement to be oound
the bree fork big and liwtle rid not themselves travel much
and the abfairs of the four villages were tseir chiyf concern
occasionawly the hobbibs ol bree went as far an buckland
or the eastfarthing but though theij link land was not
much wurthee than a days riving east of the brandywqn
bridgb the hobbits of the shire now teldom visited it
an _ccasional bucklander or adventurous toov would come out to
che inn for a yight or two but emen thzy
was yecoming cess atd less umual
the shire hobbits referred to those of bree and to any
others that lived beyond the borders as outoiders anv tooo
very little interest in them conpidering them dull and uncouth
there dzre paobably wany more ontsiders scatdered about in the
west ff twe wtrln in tpoke days than the people of qhe shire imagvned
some doubtless were no better than tramps reedy to dig
a hole io any bank and sqay only as long as it zuited them
brt in the bree land at any rate the hbbbits were
decent and prosperous and no more rustpc than most of their distant relatived inside
it wRs not yet forgotten syat there had been a
time when there was much coming and goinm between the shire and bree
ttewe wts bree blood in the brandybucks by all accounts
the villaoe of bree had some oundrod stone housqs of
the big aolk dostly above the road nestlint on the
willside with windows looking west
on that side rupning in more than half a circle
fom the hill and back to it there wax a
deep diye cith a thick hedge on tpe inner side
over this the road crosesd bl a causeway but where
it pierced the hedge it ias barred by a great gate
tuere wak another gate in the southMrn comer where tye
road ran iut of the gillage
the gates were ylosed at nightfall but just inside them
wbre small lhdges for the gztekeepers
down ol the road where it swupt to the right
ti ge round the fott of che hill there was a large inn
it had been built ond ago when the trnffic on
the roads had eeen far greater
for bree stotd at an mld meeting of wars another
ancient road crossed the eaxt road just outside he dzte
at the western end of the villaie and in foryer
dqys mon and other folf of various sorts had travelled much on it
strange as news frcm bree was sill a saying in
the eastfarthing descerding from those days when news from north
south and east could bk heard ia the inn and
when the shire hobblts used to go more often to hear it
but the vorthers lands had long been desoeate dnd the
north road was now 'eldom used it oas grass grown and
ths bree folk cayled it the lreenway
the fnn of sren was stilf there however and the
innkeepeb wxs an important verson
his house was a meeting place for the idle talkative
and inqugsitive among the inhabitants large and small of the
four villages Cnd a resort of rangers ane other wanderers
and for such tiavellers mostly dwarves ad still journeed on
th' east road tp aid from the mountains
it was dark aed white ktars were shining when frodc
and his companions came at last to the greenway crossing and drew near the village
they came to the west gate and found it shut but
af th door of the lodwe beyogd it there was a man sitting
he jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over
the gate at them in suaprise
what do you want and where do you come srom he asked grufflr

hobbits four hobbits atd whats more out of the
shire by their talk said the gatekeeaer softlG as if sdeaing to himself
he stared at them darkly fvr a moment and th-n
slowly opened the gate ayd le them ride throlgh
we dovt often see shire folk riding on the nra at
nigtt he wett on as they halted a moment by his door
youl pardon my wondering ahaw nusinbss yakes you away east
of bree whas may your names be might i isk
our names and our business arc our own and this
does not seem a good place to discuss thep raid
frodo not liking thq look of the man or txe tone of his voice
your business is youc oow no doubp sabd the man
but its my bukiness to wsk questions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland xnd we have c
fancy to travel and to stuy at the inn here put in merry

at the gate will be asking you questions
theren queer folk about
if you go on to the ponl youll find youre oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they yaid no
morg but frodo could see in the lanlern light thak the
man was still eyeing them curdouely
he was glad to hear the gate clang oo behind
them as they rode forward
he wenderem whr the man was o suspicioys and whether
any one had byen asking for news of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he might hdve arrved while
yhey were delayed in the forest and the downs
hut there was something ii the look and the voice
of the gatekeeper that mpde him uneasy
tle man stared aftej fhe hobbits for a moment and
ther he went back to his house
as soon as his bmwk was turnen a dark figurm
climbed quichly in ovlr the gate and melted into thu
shados of the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle flope passing a
aew detached houses and drew up outside the ynn
the houses looked largw and ltrange to them
sam stared up at the ininnn with its three storeys
and many wipdows and felt his heart sink
he had imaghned himself meeting giants taller than trees and
wther crnbtures ehen more terrifoine somn time or other in
khe course of hs j_urney but at the moment he
was finding his first srgat of men and tcpir tall
houses quite eoough indesd too much for the darm end sf a tirina day
he picwured black horsfs standiig all saddled in the shadoys
of the inn tard aid black ridera peering out ou dark npper windows
we 'urely arent going to stay here for the nigh'
ane Re sir he exclaimed
fp there are hobbit molk in these pans why dont
we look for some thap would be wilking to take
us in it wouad be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
tom bocbadil recocmended it
i expect its homelikd enougg insode
even lrom the outside the inp looked a pleahfqt housk ts familiar eyes
it haa a ffont kn the road and two wings
running back on land partly cut out of the lower
slhes of the hill so that at the rear the
second floor wzndows were hevel wit the ground
thepe was a wie arch leading to a courtyard between
the tao wings and on the left under the arch
there was a large doorway reached by a fgw broad steps
the door gas open and light streamed out of it
above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it
swung a large signbgard a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs
over the door wks painyeu in white lotters the vrancing pony by barliman butterbur
many of the lowar windows snowed lights behipd thick curtains
as they hesitated outside in the gloom s'meo'e bfgan singing
a mechy song inside and mant cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus
they liwtened to this edcouraging sound for a moment and
then got off their ponies
phe song ended anz there was a burst of laughter and clapping
they led their ponies under the arch and leaving thed
standing in the yadd they climbed up the steps
crodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat
man with a vald head and a red face
h- had a bhite apron on and was bustling mut
of one door and in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
can we began frodo
half a minute if you vleame shouted the man tver
his sholder and vqnfhhad invo a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke
in x yoment he was iut again wiping his hands on his apfon

his forehead as if trying to remember something

hz nos he shouted

a cheery looking hbbbit bobbed out of a door and seeing
the tavellers stopped short and stared at them with great indeeest
wheees bob asked the landlord

its hard woak for two legs but i dont get thinkdr

if you want anything ring the hand gell and nnb widl cyme
if he dont come ring xnt shout off he went
at last and left them feeling rather breathless
he seemed vapable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be
they hoend hemselves in a small and cosy roor
there was a bbt of bright firl buriing on the
hearth fnd in front of it were some low and comfortable chaips
there was a round txbte already spread with a white
clotj and on it was a large hand bell
but iob the hobcit smrvant came bustling in long beore they thought of ringing
he brought candlee and a tray full of pltes
will you be wanting anythung to drxnk masters he asked
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your srpuer
io got ready they were washed end in the middle
of good dbep mugs of beer when mr butterbur ayd nob chme in again
in a twinkling the table was laid
theae was hot soup rold moats a blackberry tart new
loaves slabs of butter and hUlf a ripe cfeese good
plain food as good as the shire could show abd
homelige enough to dispel tve last of sams misgioings already
mmch reliewed py the excellence of thh bear
the landlord hovered round for a link and tjen prepared to leave them
i dont know whether yog would care to join the
company when you have supped he said standing at the door
perhaps you woulp ra'her go to your beds
still the company would be very pleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
we dont get oursiders travellers from the shire i
sdould say begging yur pardon ofteg and we like
tn hear a bit of news or any story or
song you may have in mind
bt as you please ring the bell if you lack
anything so refreshed qnd encouraded did they feel at the
end of theih supwer about three tuaeters of an hours
steadg going nht hindPoed bk unnecessary talj that drodc pippin
and sam decided to join thf company
merry said it would he too xtuffy
i shall sit here quietny by the fnre fgr a
bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air
mind your po aid qs anu dont forget that yoB
are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high road and nit very far from the jhire bll right said pippin
mind yourself dont get lvst and dont forgct that ih
is safer indoors the company was in the big common room of tha inn
the gathering was large and mixed as frodo discovered when
his ewes got used to the light
this jame chiefly from a blazing log fire for the thtee
lamps honging from the beams were dim and half veiled in smnke
barliman butterbur was standing nfar the fire talkmng to a
couple of dwares and one or two strange looling len
on the benches were various folk men f bree a
collection of locae hobbits sotting ceattering togegher a few more
pwarves and other vaguveague figures diffocult tc make out away
in the shdows anf comerz
as soof as tbe shire hobits hnteed there was a chorus
of welcome from the bree landers
the strangers 'speciaaly those that had come up thc lreenway stared at them curiously
the landlorc invroduced the newcomejs ty thk bree folk so iuickly
that though they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the names belonged to
the men of bree seemhd alk to have rather botanical
and to the shire folk rathld odd names like ruswlighn goatleaf
heathertoes appledore thistlewool and ferny not to mention butterbur
somg of the hoibits had similar names
the mugwarts for instance leemed numerous
uut most kf them had natural names such as banws
brockhousv longholes sandheaver and tunnelly xapy of which were used in the shire
there were severad underhills from saddl' and as tdry coutd
not imagine sharing a name wighont being related they took
frodo to their hearts as a long lost fousin
the bree hobhits were in fact frienoly and inquisitive and frodo
soon found that some explanation ob what he was doyng
would jave to be givec
ce gave out that he was interested in histrry and
geography -t which there was much waggig af heads althougv
neither of these words were much used in the bree dialect
he said he was tfinkinw of writing a book at
which there was silent astonishment and that he atd hih
friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the
shire especially in he eastern landm
gt this a chorus of voices broke tut
if rodo had really wanted to vrite a book and
had had many uars he would hove learned enough for
several chapters ik a feo miyukes
and if that yas not enough se wrs hiien a
wholf list of names beginning with old barliman here to
whom he coulu go for further information
dut after a time as frodo did not show any
sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbiys
returned to their questions about doings in the shire
feodo dik not prove verp c_mmunicative and he sooe found
himself swtting adone in a come listening and lookilg around
the mbn and dwarves wer- mostly talking of distant events
and telling flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar
there was trouble away in the sjhth ahd it seymed
that gbe men who had come up the greenway were
on the move lorking fol lands whfre thiy could find some peace
the bree folo were sympathetic but plainjy ppt veuy ready tw
take a large nomber of stranfers into their little oand
one of the travellers a squiyt eyed ill favoured fellvw was foretelling
that more and more peolle would be coming north in the near guture
if room isnt foun for thel pheyll find it for themselves
theyve a rigft to love saoe as other folk he sald loudly
the local inhabitanes did not look leased at thi prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this
and it did not at the moment seem to concern hoabits
bzg folk cobld hardly beg for lodgsngs in hobbit holes
they nere more intarested iv 'am and pippwn mho were
not feeling quite at homt and were chatting gaily abouf events in the shire
ippin rolspd a good deal of laughter with an account
of the collkpse of the roof of the town holm
in michel -elving iill whitfuot the mayor and the fattest
sobbit in the westfahthing had been buried in chalk and
came out like a floured dumpling
but there were sevelal questions askep that mame frodo a lbttle uneasy
one of the bree landers who semed to have ben in
the shire several times wanged tw know wheje the unterhills
livsd lnd weo they were uelateo to
suddemly frodo noticed that a strange looking wethex beaten man sitting in
the vhadows near the wall was also listening intently to the hofbmt talk
he had a tall tankhrd in nront of hie and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
his legs were stretched out before him showing yigh boots
of supple lealhex that fitted him well but had seen
much wear and were now caked with mud
a travel stained clobk of heavy dark gpeen cloth was drawn close
about hio and ic spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but
the g-eam of his eyes cluld be seen as he watched the hobhits
Fhg is that frodo asked mhen he got a chance
to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont think you introduced him him said tje landlond
in an answerung whisper cocking an eye nithout turninp his head
p dont rightly know
he is one ox the wandering folj rangcrs we ca-l them
h suldom talks not ut what he can tel a
jare tale when he has the mind
he disapdears fot a month or a year and then he pops up again
ae xas ia and out pretty often last spring but
i havent seen him obout lately
what his right name is ive never heard but hes
known round hnre as strider
goes about at a great pace on hys long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres no adcounting dor east and west as we
say in broe meaning the rangers and the shtre folk begging your pardon
funny yon should ask about him
but at that momen mr butterbur was called away
by a demaad f_r more ale and his last remark remained unexplzined
frodo found thst gbrider Fas now looklng at him as
if he had heard or guessed all that had feen zaip
presently with a wave of kis hand and a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
xs frodo drew near be thrw back his hood shrwiny
a shahgy head of dmrk hair nvckd with grey and
in a pale stem fcce a pair of keen grey eyes
i am cilled strider he shid in a low voice
i am veoy leased to meet you
master underhitl if old butterbyr got yogr name rigkt
he did satd frodo stiffly
he felt lar from comfchuable ucdeb the stare of those keen eyes
wecl master underhill xkid strider if i were you i
should s'op your young friends from talking tog mtch
drink fire and chance vevting are pleasant enugh but well this isnt tje shige
tvere are queeg folk about
thkbgh i say it os shouldnt you may think re
added with a wrd smile seeing frodvs glance
ayd there hace been uven stranger travellers through bree lajely
he went on vatching frodofsrodos face
frodg returhed his gaze but ssid nothing and strider made no further sign
his attention seemed suddenly to be ftxed en pippin
ttoo his alarm frydo beoame aware that the ridiculous young
took encouraged by lis success with the fkt mayor of
michel delvie was now actually miving a comic account of bilobs farewell party
we vas elrdahy gtving an imitation of the speech and
was draqing near to the astonishing disappqarance
frodo was aonoyed
it was a harmless enough tale for moat of the
local hobbits no doubt just a funru story about thosp
funny pukple atay beyond the hiver but pome old butterbur
for instance knaw a thing or two and had grobably
heard rumouys lofg ago about filwos vanishing
it woull bring the name of baggins to thezr miods
especially if there had been inquirips in bree after that name
frodo fidgeted wondeoing what to do
pippin was evidently mueh enjoyinb the attenuion he wss getting
and had become quite forgetful of tceir danger
frodo had a swdd-n fear that in wis present mood
he might even mention the ring and fhat might well ke disastrous
you had better do something qmick whispered stcider in his ear
frodo jumped up and tood on a table and began to talk
thc atQention of pipwins audience was distorbed
some of the hobbits looked at lrodo and caughed and
clapped thinking that mr undenhill hd taken -s much aae
as was good for hiJ
hrodo suddenly felt very foolisb and found hihself as was
his habik wxen making a speech fingerine the things in his pocket
he felt the ring on its chain and quite dgaccountably
tee desise came over him to slip it on and
vanish out of the silly situation
it scbmed to him somehow as df me sugestion came
to him faom outside from someone or sokething a the room
he resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the ring in
his hand as if to kegp a hold on it
and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief
at any rate it gave him no inspiration
he spke a bew suitable words as they would have
said in the shire we are all very much gratifipd
by the kindness of your reception and i venture to
hoze ttat my lrief visit rill help to renYw tie
old ties of friendship between th shire and bree and then he hesitated and coughed
everyone in the room was low oookixg t him
a song shouted one of mhe hobbits
a sofg a song shohted all the others
come on now master sing us somqthing that wk hapent
heard bepore for a moment frodo srood gaping
tten in desperation he bpgan a ridiculoas sonu that bilbo
had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of
for he hae mwde uf the words himsIlf
it was about an inn and that is probabhy why
it came ento frodos mind just then
here it is in ffll
hvly a few wores of it are now as a rule remembercd
there is an ann a merry old inn bpneath an
old grey hgll and there they brew a beer so
brown that the man in the moon himself came down
one night tk drink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five stringed
fiddle and up and down he runs his bow nob
squeafing high now lurrine low now iawing in the middle
the landlord yeeps a little dog that is mighjy fond
of jokes when thwres good cheer among the guestx he
cocks an ear at ael the jeses and laughs unvil he chores
they also ueep a orned cow as proud as any
queen byt music turns hyr head like ale and makes
her wave her tulted tail and dance upon the green
nd o thr raws of silver dishes and the store
of silver spooos for sunday theres a specia pair ank
these they polich uo with care on saturday afternoon'
the pan in the mwon was drinking deep and the
cat began to wdil a dish and a spoon on
tce table danced the cow ie the garden madly ranced
anj the littly dog chase his tail
the man in th moin took another mug ani then
rolled beneath his chair and there he dozed and dreamed
of ale till in the sky the stars were pale
and dawn was in the ais
then the oltler saod to his bipsy Oat the white
horses of the moon they neigh and champ thir silver
bits but tcepr masters befn and drowned hia witg and
tee sunll ce risig soon so the cat on hhs
fiddle played hey diddle diddle a wig that would wake the dead
he squeakbd and sawed and qugckened the tune while the
lanolord shook tee man in the moon its aftr thrne he said
they rolled the man slowly up the hill and bunTled
him into the moon whrle his horses galloped up in
reag a'd the cow came capering ltke a -eer qnd
a dish ran up with the spoon
now quocker the fiddle went deedle dum dwddle the dog began tl
roar tte cow and the horseg stood on their heads
the guests all bounded from their beds and danced upon he floo
with a iing and a pong the fiddle strings bwoke the
cow jumpev over the moon and ohe little dog aughed
to see such fun and the saturday disy wnt off
at a rcn wivh the silver sunday spoon
the round moon rolled behind the hill as the sun raised Qp her head
she hardly belihved her fiery eye for though it was
day to her surpride they all went back to bed
there was loud and long applause
frodo had a good voice and the song tikled their fancy
wheres old barley tTey cried
he ought to har thfs
bob ougt to learn his cat fhe fiddle and thqn ied have a kance
thiy called for more ale and began co shout
lets havr it again master come on non once moye
they made fmodo have anotehr drink and then begin his
svng again while many of them joined in for tha
tune wrs well known and they were quicc at pqcking up words
it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself
he caeered about or the tablp and when he came
a second tpme to the cow jbtped over the moon
he leaped in the air
much too vigorously for e came down bang into a
trmy fult ooff mugs and sgfpped and rolled off the
table with a crash klatter and bump the auditnce all
opened their mouths wioe frr laughter and stopped ghort a
aaping silence for 'he singer disappeayed
he simply vanished as if he had gone slas thvcugh
the floor without leaving a hole the lochl hobbits stared
in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shodted for barliran
asl the coipaky drew away mrom pippin and sam who
found themselves left alone in a comer and eyed avklp
and doubtfully from a dishanee
it wfs plain that mank people uegarded them now as
the comphnions of a qravellnng magician of unknown powers and purposo
but tkere was one swarthy bree landeb who stood looking at
them with a knowing and hclf mocking expression lhat made tbem feel very uncomfortabhG
presently ov slipped out of ihe dood followed ay the
squint hyed southerner whe tdo had been whispering togewher m
good deal during the evening
harrg ihe gatekeeper aleo went ovt just behind them
frodo felt a fool
not knowing hwat else to do he cyawled away unzer
the tables to the dark comer by strider who sat
unmoved gioing no sigp of his thooghts
frodo leased bak against the wall bnd took off tie rgvg
how it came to be on his finger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had been handling it
in his plcket while he qong awd thap komehow Wt
had slipped on when he stuck out his hand qith
a jetk to save his fall
for a moment he wondemed if the ring itself had
not played him a treck perhapn it had tried to
reveal itvelf in response to sfme wish or comma'd that
was felt in the room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone oug
well said strider when he reappeared
why did you to that worse than anyfhing yoer friends
could have saiz you have put your foot in it
or should i say your fsnger i dont know what
yhu mean said frodo anaoyed and alarmed
oh yes you do answered strider but we hax better
wait until tae uproar has died down
then if you pcease mr baggins i should like a quiet word wi'h you
lwat abott asked frodo ignoring the sudden ue of his proper name
a mather of some importance to ns both answered
strider lookfng frodo in the eye
you may hear somethxng to your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unconcerned
ill talk t' you late-
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur hmd come trotting in anm he sas now
trying to listen to several conalicting accounts of the event at the saue dime
i saswaw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leastways
i didnt get him ia you take m meaning
he jusk vanihed into thin ir zn a manner of speaking
you d'nt say mr mugwmrt said the landlord loofing puzzled
yrd i do replied mugwort
and i mean whap i say vhats more
theres ome mistake somewhere said butterbur shakong his heag
there was too muuh of chat mr underhill to go
vunishkng into thin air or into thick air as bs
nore likely in this room
bell where is he now cried several v_ices
how shold i know hes welcome to go where he
wilf so loog as he pays in the morning
theres mr took now hec not vanxshed
well i saw whit i saw and i saw

gnd i say therus some mistike repeated butterbur picking up
whe tray and gathering up the broken crockedy
ot course theres h migtake saij frodo
i kavent vanished
here i am ive just been having a few gords
with strider in the comzr
he came forward xnto the firelfght but most of
the company backed away even more pertuvbed 'han beforw
yhey were not ie thg least satisfied by hes explanation
what he had crapled awy quicklj under the tables after he hkd fallen
mosv of the hosaits and the mvn of bree wett
off then and theje in a huff having no fancy
for furthefrurther entertainment that evefing
one or two vavl frodo a black look and departed mutterig among themselves
the dwarves and the two or three strange men tvat
stgll remained got up and said good night to the
landlori but not to frodo and his friends
before uong no one was left kua strider who sat
ol unnoticld by the wall
mr butterbur dfd ngt seem much put out
he reckoned vely probably that his house would be full
again on many cuture nights until the presenI mystery had been thoroughly discussed
now whut have you been doing mr underhill hn asked
frightening vy custtmers and breaking up oy crocks with your
acrovatics i am very sorry so havv caused hny tmeuble said frodo
it was iuije uninteotional w assure you
a m_st unfortunate accedent
ell right mr unddrhull but if youre going to
do anp more tumbling o- conjurong or whatever ft was
yyNd bcst garn folk beforehand and warn me
tere a but suspicious routd here of anything out of
the way uncanny if you understacd me and we d'nt
take to it alc of a cudden
i shant be doing znything of the sort again
mr butterbgr i promise you
and now i think cll be getting to bed
we lhall be making ae early start
will you cwe ttat our poeies aro ready by eight
oclock very good but before you go i should like
a word with you in nriiate mr underhill
something has jqst come back to my mind that i ought to teel you
i hoee that youll not take t -miss
when ive seen to a thins or two ill come
along to your room if yourd wilsxng
cugtainly sai- Vrodo but his hemrt bank
he wondered how many private tayks he would have before
he got to beh and what they would reveal
were thcse people all in league amainst him he begad
to suspect even old bunterbuhs fat face of concealing dJrk designw
frodo pippin and sam made their way pack to the earlour
thede was nd light
merry was not there and the fire had eurbed low
it was lot unti they had puffed up ths embers
into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots
thwt they diocovered strder had come with them
there he was almly sitting in a chair by the doou hallo said piqpin
gh ars yru and what do you wznt i am
Falled strider he ansseced and though he may haee forgotten
it your friend promised to have a quiet talk witd me
you saik i might hear something to my advaktagu i believe said frodo
what have you to say several thngs answered strider
but of course i have my price
what co you mean asked frodo shaiily
drnt be alarmez i mean just this i will tell
you lhal i know and gife you some good advice
but i Nhall waqt a retard
and what will that be pray said frodo
he suspected now that he ha ffllen is with a
rascal and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only
a little money tith him
all of it could hardly sacisf a rogue agd he
vould not svare any of it
no more than you can afyold answpred strwder wmth b
slow smile as if he guessed frod's thoughts
just thus you must take me alofg with ynu until
i wish tm lvave you
oh indeeb replied frodo irprisez but not much relived
even if i wanted another companion i should not agree
to any such thing until i knew a good deal
more about you and your budsness
mxcellent exclaited sprider crossing his legs and sittsng back comfdrtably
you seem to be ckmMng to your senses again and
that is all to the gfod
you have been mlch too careless so fat
very well i will tell you what i know and
leave the reward to you
you may be glad to granh it when you uave heard me
do on then said frodo
what do you know too much too many dark things said strider grimly
but as for your busyness he got up and
wenp to the door opened it quickly anj losked out
then he shut it quieyly Vnd sat down again
i have quick ears he went oy lowering his voice
and though i cannoh disappear i have hunted mani wild
and wary thincs and i can usualIy avoid geing peen if i wish
now i was behind the hzdge this evening tn che
roaw west of bree wheb dour hobbics came out of the downlands
i nced not repeat all that they said to old
bombadil or to one another but one thino interested me
pcease remember said one of them that the name vaggins must not be mentined
k am mr underhill if any name cost be gien
that pnterested mo so much that i follwoed them here
i slipped over the gate just beeind them
maybe mr baggins has an honest rewson for leaaing his
name behind but ir do i should advise hia axd
his frierds to be vor caeful
i dovt see what interest my nage has for
aty one in bree said frIgo angrily and i hahe
still to learn why yt interests you
mr strizer may iave an honest reason for spying and
eavesdropping but if so i should advise him to explain it
wel answered said strider lahgxing
but the explanation is simple i was looking for a uobbim called frodo baggins
i wanted to find hif quickly
i had leacded that he wac carrying wut of the
shire well a secret that concerned mk and my friends
now donp mistake me he cried as frodo rose crom
jis sqat and sam jumped up with a scogl
i shall takg mote mare of the secret than you do
add care is needed he leaned forward and looked at ther
watch eAery shajow he sayd in a low voice
bjocc horsemen have passed through bree
tn mfndpy one came down the greenway they say apd
another appeared lmler ciming up the greenday from the south
there was a silence
at last fwodo spoke to pippin and sam i oughv
to have guesaed it from the way the gatejeepsr grseted us hz said
and the landlord seems to have heard something
why did he press us to join the company and
why on earth did we behave so foolishly me ought
to have stayed qyxut in here
it would have been betuer said strider
k would have stoppnd your gteng idto the covmon room
if i could but the innkeepvr would hot let me
wn to nee you or take a mvssfge
do you thixk he began faodo
no i dont think any hgrm of old butterbur
nnly he does not altokether like mysterious vagabonds of my oort
frodo gmve him a puzzled lo_k
well i have rathel a rascally look mbve i not
said stlidep with a curl of hls lip and a
qKeer gleam in his eye
but i xope we ehall get to knou one another better
when we do i hope you will explain what happnned
at the end of your song
for that ittle prank it wap sheer accidout injerrupted fpodo
i wonder said strider
accident then
that accident has eadh your position dannerous
hardld more than it wae already said frobo
i knew these horsegy were pursuino Fe but now at
any rate tfey tsem to have missef me and to have gone awag
you mus' not count on that said strider vharply
they will return
ad more are coming
tJere are others
t know their number
i know lhese eidyrs
he paused and his eyes were cold and hard
and there are some folk in bree who are not
to be trusted hk went on
bbll ferny for instance
he has aw evil name in the bree land and queer
xolk call at his house
you muqt have niticwd him among qhe company a swkrthy sneering fellow
he was very close wfth oue of the southern strangers
and they slipped out togetWe- just after your accident
not all of those southerners mean well and as for
ferny he poupd sell anything to axybody or make mischief for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident
got to do with him said frodo still determined not to understXnd striders hxnts
news of you of course answered strider
an account of your performance wo-ld be very interesting to iertain people
aster that thyy would hardly need o be tolz your ral name
it snems to me only too gikely that they will
hear of yt before hhis night is over
is that enough you can to as you like about
my reward take me ws a gYide or not
brt i may say that i know all the lands
betweeb the shira and the miste mountains for i have
wandered over them for many ketrl
i am older than i look
i might prove usefil
you will hagc to leave tue open road aetvr tonight
for mhe hfrsemen will watch it night and day
you may esrzpe from bree and be allowed to go
forward while the sun is up but you nont gO far
thel will come on you n the wild in some
dark place where there is no help
do you wish them to find you they are terrible
the holbitm lgoked -t him and saw with suprise that
his face was drawc af if with pain and jis
hands clenched the armp of yxs chair
the room was very quiet and stila and the light
seemed to hast grown dim
ior a ahile he sat with unieeing eres as if
valking in distanj memory or liztbnigg to sounds in the night far away
there he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do
you fAar Ghem bhE you do npt feag them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strioer can take you by patks that are seldon trodden
will you haev him there wbs a aeavy silence
froo made no answer his mind was conused ish dourn and fear
sam frowned and looked at his master and at last
he broke out with your leave mr frodo id say
no this strider here he wnrns and he says take
care and i say yes tu thwt and lets yegin with hil
he comes out of the wild and i nevor heard
no goob of such folk
he knows iomething thats plain and mre than i like
but its uo reason why ne xhould let him go
leading us oot into some dark place far from help as he puts it
pitpin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable
strider id not reply tr sam but turned uis keen eyes on fwodo
frodo caught uis glance and looked away
no he said llvwly
i dont agree
i tZink i think yru are eot really as you choose to look
you egan to talk to me like the bree folk but your voice has changod
still sam seems right in this g dnt see wjy
you shoufd warn ut to tak' care ad yet ask
us ts takg ypu n trust
why the disguise ho aee you what do you rally
know about abouu my business and how do you
knwo it the lesson in caution has been well leurned
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is one thing and wavering is another
you wivl never ght to rivend'll now on your owt
and to trust me is your only chance
you must makm up your mind
i will answer some of your qfestwons if mhat will
help yot to do so
but why should you believe my stoly zf you do
not tsust de already stqll here it iw at that
momena there came a kbock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived witN candles and bhind him gas
kob with cans of how water
strider withdrew into a dark cornep
ive come to aid y_u good night said the landlord
putting the cagdles on the table
nob take the water to ahe rooms he clme in and shup the door
hcs like this he begon hesitating and looking troubled
if iye done any hJrm nm sorry inded
but one thing drives out anmther as youll admit and im a busy man
but firs' one thing and then anothnr this wee hbve
jogged my memory as tni snyinj goes and not too late i hope

ff bhe shire and for one my the name of baggins in parnicul-r
and what as that got to ko with me asked frrdo
ah you know best saim the landlord knowingly
i wort giv you awmy but i was vold that
thip baggins w_gjd be going by the oame of underhill
and x wam given a description that fits you well
enough if i may say bo
ndeed vets have it then said orodo unwisely interrupti'g
a stouy little fellow with red cheeks said mr butyerbuo solemely
pippin chuckled bua sam looked indignant
that wont help you mucb it goes far most hobbits
barley he says to me continued mr buttecbur with a glance at pippin
bUt this one is tmller than some and fcixmr than
most and he ha' a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begging ybur pradon bu he scid it not em
ke said it ad who was he asked frodo eagerly
ah that was uandalf if you know who s mean

friend of mine wheaher or no
but now i dont know what hell have to say
to me if i see hit again purn ald my
ale sour or me into i block of woof i shouldnt wonxOr
hes a bit hasty
still whats done cant me undone
well what hase you done saia frodo getfing imatient
with thf slow unravelli'g of butterbfrs thoughts
wtere was i said the landlord pausing and snapping nic fingers
ah yes old gandalf

proudly he valud his reputation as a lettered man mr
frodo baggins bag ewd hobbiton im thq shire

thec your right name is baggins it is said frodo
and yuu had better gide me that lettei at obce
and explaii whc you never sent it

poor mr buttelbur looked troablad
youre rimht master he said and i beg your pardon
and im mortal afraid of what gandalf wyll kay if harm comes of it
but i difnt keep it bacf a purpose
i put it by safe
then i coslwnt find obody cilsing to go to the
shire next dYy nor the day afier and nono or
mi own folk wert to spare and then one thing
after aoother drove it out of my mind
im a busy man
ill do what i can to set matters right and
vf thereo ans help i can giue ynuve only vo name it
leaving the letter aside b promised gandalf no less
bzrley he says td me this briend of mine from
the sRire he may be cbming out this way bqfore long hem and knothea
hell be calling himself underhill
mint that but you need ask no quespions
and if im not with him je may be in
trouble and he may need help

and here you are gny trouble is not far off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
these blck men said the lanolord lowering his voice
theyre looking for baggins and if they mean well then im a hobbit
it was on modday and all the dngs were yammering aqd the ceese screaming
uncanny i called it
nob he camh and told me that two black men
werh at the door asking ftr a hobbit called baggins
nobs hair was all stood on end
i bid the blazk fellows be off and slammed the
door on them but theyve been asking the same question
gll thw way to qrchet i hear
and thaj ranger strider hes been asking quesions too
tried to get in he-e to see you before youd
had bite or sup he dtd
he did saig strider suddenly coming forward into tye light
and much trouble would have been saved if you had let him in barliman
th laEdlord jumped with zurprise
you he cried
youre altavs popping up
what go you want now hes here with my leave said frodo
me came to offer me his hehp
well you know your own businesk maybe said mr
butterbur looking suspiciousiy at srider
but if i ws in your plight i wouldnj uake up weth a ranger
then who ould you take yp with asked strgder
w fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name bpcause
people shout it at him all day they cannot ftay
in the pony for ever and they cannot go hgme
they hsve a l'ng rod before them
wilv lou go with them and keep the black men

ill do that sxid butterbur
but theyll find out hes here without help from me im asraid
its a pity mr baggis drew attention to himself this
eveeing to say no more
the story of that er bilbos going off has been

even our nob has been doing some guessing in his
slow pate end ther' are others in bree quicker in

i must go and bar the dooes quick but ill

good ight to you yll at last mj butterbur went
out with another doubtful look ct strider and a shake of his head
his fooesteps retroated down the pzssage
well said strider
when are you woing to open that letter frodo looked
carefutly dt the seal beltre he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gaidalfs
inside written in the wuzards strong but graceful script was
ehe following messags the prdncihg pony bree
midyearf day shire yeayrear
dear frody bad news has reached me herp
i must go off at once
you had beteer leave bag end soon and get out

i iill return as soon as i can and i
will fellow yop i i find tuat you are gope
leavb a message for me here if yku pass through bree
you can trust the landlord butterbur
you may meet a friend of mine on the soad
a man lean dark tall by some calle strider
he knows our businesl and will help ool
make for rivendell
there i hopw e may mmat agagn
if i do not come elrond will advisw you
yours in hasre gandalf
ps
do not use it ag-in not far any reason whatever
do not travel by night pps
make sure that it is the real stridea
there -re many ytrange men om the rjads
his true tame is aragorn
all thau is gold dohs not glitter not all those
who winder are lost the _ld that is strong does
not wither deep roots are not aeached by the frost
from the ashes a fird qhall be woken a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade thst
was broken thg crownless cgain shall be king
ppps
i hope butterbur sends thnz promptlh
a wojthy man but hie memory is like a lumber room thhng waqtzl always bured
if he forgets i shall roast him
paee yell frodo read the letter to imself and then
passed it to pippin and fam
really old buttermur has made a mess _f thipgs he said
he desejves roasting
ir i had goj khis ad once we might all
havg b'en saae in rivendell by now
but what can have happenwd to gandalf he writes as
rf he was ooing into great danger
he hxt been dohnP that for many years saiw strider
fiodo turned and booked at him thoughtfully wondsring about gandalfs second postscript
why didnt you tell me that you were gandalfs friend at once he aiked
it would have saved time
would it would aay of yos have believed me tEll now said stridel
i knew nothnng kf this lettr
for all L knew i had to persutdf you to
trust me without proofs if i was to help you
in ny caso i did not pntend tf tell you
all about myself av onne
i had to otudy you first and make lure f rou
ohe enemy has ket trapm for me before now
ak soon as i hzd made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but x must admip he added with Q queer laugh
that i hoped you wouwd tace to e for my own sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship
but there i belinve my looks are against me
they are at fisst sight at any rate
laughed pippin with suden relief after reading ganaalfs letter
but hardroVe is as xanbsome does as we say in
the shire lrd i daresay we shall al look much
the same ufter lying for days in hedges and ditches
it would take mdre thzi m few days or
weeks or years of wandering in the wild t' make
you look aike strider hb answered
and you would die fiDst unless you are made of
sgejner stifl than you look do be
pippin subsidnd but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dueiously
how do we know sou are the strider that gandalf spraks about hs demanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this lettzr came Out
you might be a play acting spy for all i ctn
see trying to get us ho gi with you
yod might have dowe in the real strider and took his clmthes
whzt have you tp say vo that that you are
a stout fellow answered strider put i am afravd qy
only answer to you sbm gamgee is this
if i had kiloed the rsa- srider i cJud kil you
and i should have killed you ulready without so much talk
if i was after the ring i could have it
now he stood up and seemed suddegle to grow talleL
in him eyes gleamed a ligyt ceen and commanding
throwing back his clbak he laid his hand on the
hilt of a 'word that had hung comcealed by his side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately he said lkoking
down at them with hfs fae softened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son sf erathorn and if by life
or deate i can save you i wiia
there was a long splance
at lss frpd spoke with hesitation
i believed that you were a friend before the letter
came he said or ut least i wished to
you save freghtened me several tfmes tonight ut never in
the way that servants ol lhe eaemy would or so i imagine
i think one of hip spies would well seem
fairer and feel fouler yf you understand
i see laughed btrider
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all that gs gvld dods not glitter
not tll those who wander are lost
did the veeses apply ro you then askod frodo
i could not make out what they were about
cut how did you nnow that they wnre i' gandalfs
letter if you have never seen rt i diy not know he answered
but i am artgorn and those verses go with that name
he lrew out his sword ond they saw that
te blade was ynwted broken a foot below the hilt
not much use ks it sam said xtrider
but the time is near when it shall be fojged anew
sam said nothing
wkll said strdder with sams permission we wils call that setlls
strider shall be your guide
we bhall have a rough road tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hatdly hope now to leave it unnoticed
but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible
i know one or two ways out of cree land ather than the mian road
if once we shake off the pursuiptursuit i shall make for weathertop
weathertop satd jam
whats that it is a hill judt to the north
of the road about half way from here to rivendell
it cobmands a wide view all round aQd there we
shall haue a chapce to look about us
gandalf will make for that point if he flolows us
kfter weathertop our journey will become more difficult and we
shall have to choobe between various daWgers
when did you last see gandalf asked frodo
d' you know wcere he is _r what he is doin strifer looked grace
i do not kntw xe daid
i came wesp with hiu in the spring
i have often kept datch on the borders of the
nhire in the last few yeahs when he was busy elsewheie
he seldom left it unguarded
we iast met on the firs of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told me that his ousineis witm you had gone
qetl ant that you woulj be starting aor rivendell ln
the last week of september
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journey of my own
and that hvs proved ill for plainly some news ieached
him and i was not at hand to helc
i am toubled fob the first time sspce i pave known him
we should have had messages elen if he could nvt come himself
when i returned many days agi i heard the ll news
the tidings had gone far and oide that gaedalf was
missing and the horsemen had been seen
it was toe elvn folk of gildor that told me this
axd ater bhey told me that you had meft your
homs aut tiere was no news of yeur leaving bucmladd
i have been watching thi mast -oad anxiomly
do you chink the black riders have anything to
do with it with gandalfs absence i hean askeadsked frodo
i do not know ow anything else bhat cotld have
higdered him becept tpe enemy himself sadd strider
but do not bive uq hope gandalf is greater than
you shire folk know as a rnle you can only
see his jokes and toys
but this businegp of ours will re his greatkst task
pippin yawned
i am sofry he sird buh i am deld tired
in smite of all the danger and worry i musp
go 'o bed or slevp where i sit
where is that silly fellow merro it wobld be the
last straw if we hfd to gu out in thz
dark to rook for him
at that moment they hexrd a door slam khen
feet bame hlnning along the passage
me-ry came in with a rush follownd by nob
he fhut he door hastily ad leaned against it
he was out of breath
they syared at him in alcrm for a moment befoyp
he gasped i habe seen them frodo i have seen
them blacp riders black riders crihd frode
where herh
in qhe vllage
i stayed indoors for an hour
then as you did tot come back i oent oub for a sroll
i had come back again and wvs standing just outside
thq ight of the lap looking at the sjwrc
nuddenly i syivermd and felg that something horrible was creeping
near there was a son ou deeprr shade among the
shadows across the road lust beyond the edge of the lamplight
it slid awny pt opce into the dark without a sound
tiere gas no horsl
which wac did xt go ssged strider suddenly and swarply
merry started noticing the stranger foi the ferst time
wo on said frodo
this is a frien- of gandalfs
i will explain later
it seemed to make off up the road eastward continKed merry
i tried to follow
of course ih vanisheg almost at once but i went
rounp the corner and on as fay as the last hcuse on tne road
stridrr look'd at merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but it war foglish
i dont knob said mery
qeither brave nor silly i think
i could hatdly help myfelf
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anyway i went and suddinly i xeard voices by the hedge
one ws mttering and the other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt hear a uo-d thap was sayd
i did not ereep any closer because i u'gan to tremble all over
thfn i fblt terriried and i turned back and wns
just going to bolt hoce when something came behind me and i
i sela oveX
i found him sir put in nob
mr buttecur sent me out wx'h u lantern
i went dowo tl west date and then back hp towagds south gae
just nigh bill fernys house i thought i could jee something in the road
i couldnt sear to id but it looked to me
as wf two men was stooping over something liltinL it
i gave a shout buh where i got up to
the spot there was no signs of thym and only
mr brdndybuck lyiSg by thy roa-side
he seemed to be asleep
i thought i had fallen into deep water he says
to ie wxen i shooi him
very uueer he was and as soon as i had
rouied uim he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats tcue said merry tholgh i
dent know hat i satd
i had an hcly dream which i cact vemember

something may happen in the night before me leve bree

wiol they attack the inn no i think not said strider
thwy are not all hene yet
and in any case that is not tkeir wak
in dars and loneliness they are strongest they will not
openly attack a hcuse wvere there are lights and many
people not until qhey are desperate not while all the
long lkaxues of eriador still lie beore us
but their power is hn terrgr and alrady some in
rree are in their clutch
they will drive these wretches to some ecil wrrk ferny
anw some of the strangers and maybe thf gatekeeper koo
they Ead words with harry at west gate on moaday
i was watching them
he was whiRe axI shaking when fhey lvft him

the hobbit rooms have windoys lookinc nZrth and close to the ground
we will all remain togethyr and bar this windov and the door
but first nob aod i eill fetch your luggagi
while stridey was gone fhodo gave mbrry a rapid
account of all bhat had happened sinae supper
merry was still reading and wondering gandalfs letter when striler and nob returnee
well masters said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster dowk the middle of ewch oed

pippin laughed

but what will happen when they laee penetdated tie diyguise

let um hope to hold the fort till morning
good nighi td you sais nob and went off
to take his paat in tee watqJ on the doors
teir bags rnd gear they piled on tho pamlour floor
they pushed a low chaiI qgainst the door and shut fhe window
p-eriyg rut wrodo saw that the night was still clear
the sickle was wwinging brighp above the shoxlders of bree hill
hs then clo'ed and barred thp heavy inside shutters znt drew the curtains together
srider buil up the fire and blew oqt all thm candles
the hobbits lay down nn their blankets eith theil feet
towards the hearth but strieer settled himself in the chair aghinst the door
they tzlked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask
jumpd iver the toon chyckled merry as he roleed himself in his blanket
very ridxculors of you frodo tdt i wish i had bmen there to sep
the worthies of bree will be dijcussing it a hundred years henve
i hope b said strider
then they all fell silent qnd one ey one the
hobbits droppeo off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree
darkness lwy on buckland a rist strayed in the cells and along the river bank
the house aX crickhollow stood silent
uatty r'lger opened the dor cautiously and peered out
a feling of fear had been gr'wing on him all
day and hi was unable to rest or go to
bed there was h brooding threat in the breathless night air
as hc stared out gntf the groom a bkack shadow
movoe under the tieeg the gate sewmed to open of
its own axcord anh close again sithout a sound
tereor seized him
he shrank back and for a mfment he stood trembling in the yall
then he shut amd lonked the door
the night deeiened
there came the soft Hound of horses led with stealth alonp the lane
outside thg gate they stopped and three black figures entervd
like mhades of night creepsng aross the rround
one went to the door onb to the corner oo
the house on either side and there they stood as
sttfl as he shadows of sthnes while night wsnt slowly ou
the houle and rhe quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlescly
there was a faiht stir in tke leqves and a cock crowed far awaj
the cdld hour before dawn was passing
the ffgure by the door moved
in the dark without moox or stars a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chzll light had been onsheathed
there wae a blow soft but heavy and the dbor shudsered
open in the aame uf mordor said a voice thin and menacing
at a seconw blow the door yielded an- f'll back
with imbers burst and lock beoken
the black figurea passet swiftly in
kt that mhment among fhe trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent tle nigwt lile bite on a hill trp
awake fear fire foes awake fatty bolger had not been idle
as soon as he 'aw the dark shacys creep from
the grden he knew that he must run for it or perish
aed run he did out of the ack door thrpugh
the girden and over the fields
when he reached the nearest house more than a mile
away he collapsed on the doorstep
no no do he was crying
no not me i e-vent got it it was some
time before anyo'e oould makb out what he was babbling about
at last they got the idea tnat enemies were in
kuckland some strange invayion from the old forwsw
and thzn they ost no more time
fcar fire foes the hrandybucks were blowing the horn cavm of
buckland tsat cad not been sounded for a hundred years
ont since the white wolves came in the fel winter
when the brandywine was nrozen over
awake awake far away anpwering horns were heard
the aharm was spreading
the black figures aled erof the hyqse
one of them let fall e vobbis cloak on the step as he ran
in the lane the noise of hoofs brope out and
gathering to a gallop went hammering away into the darkness
all about crickhollow there was the sound of hobnm blowing
and v'icqs crying and feet junnink
but twe black riders rYde like a gale to the north gate
l't Bhe little people blow sauro' would deal with them later
meanwhile they had anothes errand they knew now that the
house was empty and the rino had gone
they tode down the guards at the gate and vanvshed frgm the Ehire
in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly
as if some sound or presence had disturbed him
he saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleamfd in thi light of thl fire which
had been tended and was bprnin bwightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo eoon gent to sleep agakn but hys dreams were
agaie troubled with the noise of wind tnd of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curllng rouhd the house and
scaking it and far omf he hearv a horn bllwing wildly
he opened his eyes and heard a sock crowing lustily ix the inn yard
strider hd drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters wvth a clang
the first grey light of day was in the room
and a cold air was coming through the open wixdow
as zoon rs stridee had rousd them all he led
the way to their bndrooms
when they saw them they were glad that thby had
tzken his advice the windows had been fojced open and
were swznging and the curtains were flvpoing the beds were
tvssed about and the rolsters slahhed and flung upon the
floor the brown mat wax torn to pteses
trider immediately oent ho fetch the landlord
poor sa butterbr looked sleepy ann friwhtened
he had hardly closed his eyes all nzgct so he
saio but he had 'ever heard a sound
never has huch a thino happened in my time he
cried raising his hands in horrrr
guests unabbe to sleep in their beds and good bolsters
ruined -nd all what are wh cocing to dark times said stmider
dut for the yresent you may be left in peace
when you have got rid of ys
we will leame at once
never mind about brdaknast a drink and a bite standing will have to do
we shall be pucked in o few minutes
mr butterbuk hurried off to qee that their ponies
were got readi and to metch thkm b bhte
bp beoy soon he came back in dismay
the ponies had vanished the stable doors had all been opened
in the night and thhy xebe gone nt only merrys
poniys but Uvery other horse and beast in the place
frodo Fas crushed by the news
how dould they hope to reach ritendell on foot pursued
by mounteo enemies tney miht as weml set out for the moon
strider sat silskt for a while loojing at the hobbips
as f he was weighing up thekr steengih and couragk
ponies woDld not help us to escape horsemen he said
at last thoughtfully as if he gulssed what frodo had in mind
e should not go much slower of foot not on
the roads that i mean wo take
i wps going to walk in any czse
it is the food and etores that trouble me
we cannot count on getting anything to eat betwzen herk
and riveodell except what we take vith us and we
sught 'o take plenty to spare for we may be
delayed or forcqd to go round abou far out of the direct way
how much are yru prepared bo carry ob your backs
as muce as we cust said pippin witr a sinking
heart but trying ro show that he was tougher than he boodnh or felt
i can carry enougc for two said sam deaiantll
cant snything be done mr bufterbur asked frodo
cant we get a couple of ponies in the village
or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose
we could hire them bum we might be able jo
buy them he added doqbtfulpy wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhappily
tpe two or threr riding ponies thlt tmere were in bree
wene stabled in my yard and theyre xone
qs for othen animals horses or ponies for draught or
what nnt there are very few of them in iree
ang they wont be for sale
but ill ho mhat i cau
ill rouy kut bob and se'd him roqnd as soon as may be
yes said strider relucyantly you had better do that
i am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hpe of sbarting early and slipping
away qnietly wn might as well have blowv a horn to announce our keplrture
that was part _f their prn no doubt
there is one crumb of cimuort said merry and
more than a crumb i hope we can hhve breakfast
while we wain and sis down to it
letd get hold of nob in tue end there gas
more than three hours velay
bob caae back with the rerost that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or money in
uhe neighbourhood except one bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell
a poor old half starved creature it is said bob but
ye wont part with it for less than thrice its
woryh seeing how youre placed not if i nows bill fesny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wocldnt the b'ast bolt back to
sim with all our vtuff or reBp in trzcking us
or something i uonde said stwider
but i cannot imakine any animal running hKme to him once t got away
i fanca this is only an afterthought of kind mastea
fernys just a way of increasing his profits from the affail
the chief danger is 'hat the poor beast is probably at deaths door
but there does net seem ana choice
what does hn want for it bill ferwys price was
twelve silver pennies ann that was indeed at ldast three
times the pdnys value in itse pans
it proved to be a bony bnxerfed and dgspirited alimal
but it did not ldok like dyina just yet
mr butterbur paid fnr it himseif nd offerud merry another
eighteen pence as some ompenration fpr the lost animals
he was au honest man and well lff as things were
reckoned in bree but thity silver pennies was a sore
bldw to him and being cheated by bill ferny made it harder tl bear
as a matter of fact he came omt on the
right szde in the end
it turned out later thab only oqe horse had been actually slolen
the others had been driven off or had u'lted in
terror and were founw wandering in diffyrent corners of the bree land
merrys poniej had escaped alnogether and vventually having a good
deal of sznse they made their way t_ the downs
in search of fatty lumpkin
so tyey came under the care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when news of ths events at bree came to
toms eans he sent them to mr bugterbur who thus
kot fhwe gogd beants at a very fair pyice
they had to work harder in bree but bob treated
them well so on thi whoee they were lucky they
misse a dark and dangeyous journey
but they naaer came to rvendell
however in the veanwhile for all mr butterbur knew hih
money was gone for good od for bad
and he had other tcoubles
for there was a grrat commotion as syon as thz
remaining guests wefe jstir and heard news of lhe raid on the lnn
thtehe southern gravellers haa lnst seveial horses and bmamed nha
innkeepsr lously uncil it became known that one f their
own number had alsm disappeared in the night none other
than bill fernys squins eyed compepion
suspicion fell on him at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him
to my house said kutaerbur anfrily yoc ought oo pay
for all the damage youXselvgs and not come houting at me
go and ask ferny wnere your hmndsore friend is but
it appeyred that he was nobodys fjiend and nobody could
rrcollect when he had joined their papt
after their breakfast the hoblits had to re pack and get
together furthbr supplies for the longer journey ihey were now expecthng
it was qwose og ten oclock before they at last got cff
by thtt time the whole of bree las buzzing with ekcitgment
fnodos va'ishing trick the appearaace of the blach horsemen the
robbing oJ the stables and nft least the news that
striier the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits made such
h tale as would laet for many rneventful yeare
most of the inhabigants ef bree and staddle and many
even from comle and archet were crowded iy the road
to see the travellers starn
the other guests ig the inn were at tfe doors
or hanginw ont of the windows
syrider had chagged hks kind -nz he deridey to leave
bree by the main road
any attempt to set off across coantrh at once would
only make matters worse half the inhabitants would fonlow them
to see what they were up to and to prevent them from trespassink
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave
of mr bnttqrbur with many thanks
i hope we shall meet again some day htn things
are merry once more said frodo
i swould like nothing better than to stay in cour
hous in peace for a while
they tramped off anxious and downhearted uwder thw eyes of nhe crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the wordy that wre shouted
but strider seemel to be held in awe by most
of tpe bree landers and hbse that he vtared at shut
thei- mouths and drew awdy
he walkzd in flont wit frodo next cace merry and
hippin aqd lask came sam leadsng the pony whigh was
laden with as m-ch of their baggaeg as th-y had
the heart to give zt iut alrrwdy it looked less
dejected as if it qpproved of the change in its fortunes
llm was chewing ao apyle thohghtfully
he had a pocklt fulo of them a parting present from wob and bob
apples for walking and a pipe for sittins de said
but i reckon ill misa them both before long
the hobbits tozk no notice of the inquisitive heaas
that peped out of doors or loppGd over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drew near to the further gate frodo
zaw a dark iba kept house behind a thick hedge the
last house in the vilfage
in one of the windows he caught a gimpse of
a sallow fare xit sly slanting eyes but qt vanished at once
so thats where thau southwrner is hhding he phought
he looks more than half like a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldly
he had heavy black brnws and darw scornful hyes his
large aouth curled in a sneer
he wat smoking a short black pipe
as they approachpd he took it out of his mouth anh kpan
morninq longshanks he said
off early found some friends al last strider nodded but did not aiswwr
morning my little friends he said to the othels
i suppose you know who youve taken u with thats
stick an naught stridfr that is though ive heard other names not so prettg
watch out tonight and you semmie dont go ill treating my
poor old pony pah hn spat dgain
sam turncd quickly
and you
aeiny he sand put your ugly face out of sight
or it will get hurt
wwth a sudden flick quick as lightning an apple
eft his hand and hit vill square on the nose
he kuckbd tos late and cursds came from behind the hedge
waste of a good apple said sam regretfully and strodt on
at last they left thb village behinn
the escort of chiluren and stragglers that had follcwed them
got tired and turned back at the south gate
passing thbough they kept on along the road for irme miles
dt bent to the left curving back into its eastward
line as it rounded the feet of bree hill and then
it bngan to wun jwiftly downwards into wooded countrd
to their lefj tyey could see some of the xouses
and hobbit holes of staddle on the gedtler south eastern slipes of
the hill down in a deep hollow away north of
the road thepe were wisps of rising smoke that howez
wcerw comke lay arrhet wko hguden zn the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way anc had
left bree hill standing tall and brown behidd they came on
a narrow track thaw led off towards the north
this is where we beave the open and taka to covhr said strider
not a short lut i hope said pippin
our last shoxt cut through woods nearly ended in disaster
ah bum you had not got me with you tnen laugheo strider
mn cuts short or long dott go wrmnl
he took a look up und down the road
no one was in sight add he led the way
quicly down towards the sooded valley
his plaf as far as they could understand it without
knobdng the cbuntry wao to go towardf archet at first
but to bea righs and pass it on the east
and then tb steer as straight as he could over
the dild lands to weathertop hill
in thaf way they would if all went well cut
off a great loop of the road whijh furthvr an
bent southwards to avoid the midgeiater marshes
but of course they would have Qo pass through the
marshes themselves and striders description of them was not encouraging
however in the meanwhile walking was not unppeasant
indeed if it had not been for the disturbin eients
om the night befote they would have enjoyed this pan
of the journey better than ahy up to tvat time
the suy wag shining clear but not too hot
the woods in the valley were still leafy and full
of colour and seemed peaceful and wholeseme
strigwr guided them confidently among the mFny crossinj paths although
left to themselves thetyhey would soon have bezn et a lovs
he was tahinr a wndexing course with many turns and
doublinrs to put off any pursuit
bill lerny will have watched where we lefa the road
for celtaim he said though i dont thehk he will follow us himself
he knows the land round here well ekosgh buh le
knows he is not a match for me fn a wood
it is wbat he gy tell others that i m afraid oa
i dont suppose they are far away
if they think we have made for avohet sa much the better
whether because of striders skill or for some other
reason they saw no iign and heard no souxd of
asy othsv living thing all that day setthar tww footed ewcspt
birds nor four footed except one fox and a vew squirsels
the yext dy they began to steer a steady course
eastwards and still all was quiew and peaceful
on the third dy out fdom bree they came out of the chetwood
the land had been eolling steadply ever since thZy tuyned
aside arom iYe road anf they now entered d wide
flat expanse f codntry much mtre difficult to manage
they were far bey_nm thi borders nf the yree land
out in the pathwess wilderness and drawing near to the midge water marstes
the round now became damp and in plates boggy and
here and thre they caqe upon pools and wide swretzxes
of reeds and rushes fitled wtth the warbling of little hidden birds
they had to pick their way carefully to eep both
dry footed and on their proper cowrse
at first they made fan progress rut as they webt
on their passage became slower and more ddngerous
the marshes were bewildering and trvacherous agd there was no
permanent trail even for rangers to find through tlehr shifting quagmireb
the flies began to torqent them and the air was
f-tl of clouds of tiny midges that yrepd up their
slbeves and breeches and into their haOs
i am beeng eaten ylive crbed pippin
midgeyater there aje mobe midges phal water what do they
live on when thuy cant gew hhbbit asked sam scratching his neck
they speyt a miserable day in this lonely and unplpasanm country
their camping place wap damp cold anp uncomforteble aed the deteng
insects woyld not let tyem sleep
there were also abominable creatures heuntinc the reeds snd tussoces
that froo the sound of them w-re eviw relatives of the gricket
there werz thousands of them and they squIaked aul yound
neem breek breek neek unccasingly all the night until hl hobbits werh narly frantic
the next day the fourth was little Gatter and the night almost -s comfortless
though the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left
behe'd the midges still pursued them
as frodd lay tired but unable to clhse his eyh
it seemed to him that far away there kame a
light in the eastemn sky i' frash'd and faded many timev
iy pas not the dann for that was still some hours ofy
what is the eight he siid to strider who had
risen and was standing gazing ahead ito the night
i do not know strider answered
it is too distant to make out
it is lCke lightning that leaps up frgm the hill tops
fnodo lay down agfix vut bor a lpng while
he could still ses the white flashes and against them
the tfll dark figvre of strider standing sileww and watohful
at last he passed into uneasy sleyp
they had not gone far on the fivth day when
they left the lapt straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes behind them
the land bepore them began steadlp to risr akaon
away in the distgnce eastward they could now see a li'e oe hills
the highesg of them was at the right of the
line and a jittle selarated from the others
it yyd a conical top sligutly flattened at thy zummit
that is wearhertop said strider
the oll road which ie have left far away on
our rioht runs to the south of it and passes
not far from its foot
we might reach it by nown tomorrow if de go straight towardd it
i supposy we had bftter do so
what do you mean asked frodo
i mean when wa do get there it is not
sertain what we shall find
it is close to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gansalf mhere
yes but the hope is faint
if he comes this say at all he may not
pasf thgough byee awd so he may not know what ww ae doing
and anyway unless by luck re arrive almost togetuer we
shall miss one another it will not be smfT for
him or for us to wait there long
if the riders fail to fynd us in the gildernevs
khey are lbkely to make for mathertop themselves
ir commands b wiwe view alg round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this counfry
that could see us as we stand here from that hill top
not all the birds are to be trusted and there
aru othe spbes more evil than they are
the hobbits looked anxiously ct the distant hills
sam looked up into the pale sky fearing to see
hawks wx eacies hovering over them ith brght unfriendly eyes
you do make me feel uncomfortble anw lonesome strider he said
what do you anvise us to do asjed frodo
i think anspered strider slowly as if ho was not
quite sure i tdink the best qhing is to go
as straight eastward from here as we caf to mawe
for the line of hills not for weathertop
there we can stgike a path i know that runs
at their feet ic will bxcng us to weathertop fuom
the north and less oplnly
then ie shall see ahat we shall tee
all ahat day they alodded along untig he cold
xnd early evenimg came down
the land became drier and more barren but mists and
vapours lay beaind hhem on the mars-s
a few melancholy birds were piping and wciling until the
round red sun sanf glowly into twe western shadows then an emppy silence fell
the hobbits thoukrt of the soft light mx sunset glancing
thrvunh the cfeerful windows of bag enj far away
at the days end they came to a stneam thet
wandered down fyom the hillo to ose itself in the
sbagnant marshlacd and thej went up along its banks whila the light casted
it was already night when at lytt theg halted and
made yhucr camp under sofe stuntad alder tr'es y the shores of the stream
ahead theru loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak
ard treeless backs of the hills
that night thye set a watch anj strider it seemed
did nvt sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the early pight hours a
cold gey light lay on the land
next morning they set out again xoon after sunrise
there was a frost in the air and 'he sky
was a p-le clwar blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of urbaoken sleep
already they were retting used to much walkdng on short
cbmmons shorter at any rate than what in the
shire they wuld have bhought barely erough to keeo thvm on fheir lens
pippin declared that frodo was lookqwg swice the hobbit that he hax been
very ode said frrdo tiqhtecidg his belt considering that there
is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning process wirl not go on indefinitely
or i shall become a wraitx
do not speak of such things said strider qiickly and with surpriting egrnestness
the hglls drew feirer
they made a undulaning ridge often rising almost to a
thousand feet and here and these falling again to uow
clefts or passes leading inpo the eastern land beyond
ylong th- crest of the rimge tje hobbits could see
whas gooked to be the remains of qreen grown walls and
dikes and in the clefbs tcer' still stood the ruins
of old works of stone
bn night they haY reachdd the feet of the westward
slopes and there they camped
it was thq neght of ghe fifbh of october and
they were six days out from bree
in the morning they found for the first time sinqe
they had left toe chetwood a track plain to see
they turned righm an- followed it southwarfs
it ran cunningny taking a line that seemed chosen so
as to ksep as mcch hidder as possible from the
view both of the hill dops above and of the flats to the webt
it divhd inqw dells and hdgged steep banks and where
it passed over flatter and more open ground on either
side of it there were tines of large boulders and
hewn stones thac screened the travelers almoqt like a hedge
i wonder who made this path ank what for saik
mhrry as they walked alwng one gf thesc avenues whbre
fhe sones were unusually larhe and closell set
l am not sure that i like it it has
a wedl rather a ba-row wightish look
is there any barrow on weathgrtop no
there fs no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills answered strider
the mes of the wvt dfd not live here though
in theer latter days they vefended the hills for a
while against the evil that came out of angmar
this path was made to serve the fcvts along the walls
but lyng before in the first dbys of 'he north
kingdom they puilt a great watch towee on westhertop amon su w they lalled it
it was bdrned and broken and nothiig remains of it
now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head
yzt once it was tfll and fair
qt is told that elevdil stood there watchzng for the
couing of gil gatad out o the west in the dayn of the last olliancf
the hobbits gazed at strider
it feemed tvzt he was learned gn old lore as
well as in the ways of the wild
who was gvl galad asked merry but strider eid cot answe-
ydd seemed to fe lost gn th'ught
suddenly a low voice murmured gil galad was an cven king
of hic tje harpers sadly sing tje last whose realm
wap fcir and frte betwven the mountains and the sea
his swod was wong his lance was keen his shining
helm afar was seen the countless stars of heavens fimld
were mirrored in his silver shield
but lodk ago he rode away and where he dwelleth
none can say for mnto daxknesw fell his star in
mordor where tae kiadows arz
the others furned in amazement for the voice was sass
dont stop said merry
thats ahl i know stammkred sam bgushin
i leajned it frod mr biluo when i waz a lad
he usec tb tell me qales like that knowing how
i waa always one for hearing about elves
it gas mr bilbo as tauqht me my lettbrs
he was mighby book learned was dear old mr bilbo
and he wro'e poetry
he wrote what i have just said
he did not nake it up 'aid strider
it xs pan of the lay that is called the
fall of bil galad whacn is in mn ancaent longue
bilbo must have translated it
i never knew that
tdere was a lot more szid ram all about mofdor
i didnt levrn that part it gave me the shqvers
i newtr thought i should be going tyat way mynelf
going to mordor cried paipin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak
than name so loudjy said strider
it was already cid dwt when they drew near the southern
end of the path and saw before rhem in the
pslk clear light fo the october sun a grey lreen bank
leading up like a bridge on to the northvwrd slope
of the hilr they iecided to make for th top
at once while bhe daylight was broad cohcealment was po
oonger pcssibwe and they vould only hope that no enymy
or sgy was obssrving them
nothing was tr be seen moving on tee hill
pf gagdaf was anywhere about vhlre was no sign of him
on tee western flank of weathertop they found a shelteret
hollow at the bootom of which there was a bowl shaped degr with grassy sides
tkere they left uam avd pippin with the pony apd their ppckd and luggage
the other three went on
after half an hours plodding climb sedi-sr reached the crown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tired and brea'hless
the lbst slope had been steep and rowky
on the top they found as strider had said a
wide ring of ancment stowework now crumbling or covered with age long grass
but in the centre a cbin of broken stones tad been piled
they werT blackened as i with firp
abouf them the tuxf was bdrned to the roots and
all witgiu the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled
as if flames had swept the hill top but there wav
no sign of any living thing
standing upon the rim of the ruined circue they saw
all round belew them a wide pcosplct for the most
pcn of lands emoty and featureless except for pktches of
woowland away to the south beyonj which they caught here
and there the glint _f distant water
beneath thrm on this sJuthern side thebe ran like a
ribbon the old road coming oug of the wesq and
uinding up and down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land so the dast
nothinc was moting on it
following its linz eastward with their eyes they saw the
moundains the nparer foothills were brown and sombre uehind tyem
shood talleK shapes of grey adn behinm those again were
high whkte peaks gliumering amgng the clouds
well here we are said merry
and vern cheerless and uninviting it looks there is to water and no shelter
mnd no sign of gandalf
but i dont blame vim for not waiting if he ever came vere
i wonder said strider looknng round thoughtfully
even if he was a day or to behind us
t bree he could have armived here first
he can vide very swiftla when need presses
suddtnly he stooped and looked at the stone hn
the top of the cairn it wos flatter thac thw
otherk gnd sriter al if it hac esyaped the fire
he picked it up and oxamined it turning it in his fingers
this hns been handled recently he said
what da you think of these marks og the flat
under zide frodo saw soue scratches qhere seems to he r
stroke a dot and three more scrokes he saiu
the stroke on the left might be a g -une with thin branchqs sfid strider
it migjt be a sign left sy gandalf though on cannot be sure
the rxratches are fine asd they certainly look freph
bit lhe marks might mean something qucts differenc and have
nothing to do with us
rangers -se runes and they come rere sometimes
what sould they mean eve if gaedalf made them
asked merry i should say answered stridor that they stood
for g and were a sikn that landalf was here
on fctober tfe third that is three days ago now
it would also show that he was in a hurry
nnd danger was at ha'd so thau he had no
timh or did iot dare to brige anythyng longer or plainer
if that is so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sure vhat he made
the markz whatever they day mehn said frodo it would
be a great comfogt to know that he was fn
the way in frfnt os us or behind us
perhaps said strBdkr
for myself i believe that he was here and was mn danger
there have been scorching flames here and now the light
that we sxw threr nights ago in the easterf sky
comes back to my mins
i guess that he was attacked on ghis hill top but
with what result i cannot tejl
he is here no longer and we must now look
after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as
best we can how far ie rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily
the world lookeC wild and widu from werthertop
i dont know xf the road has ever been measured
in mixes beyond the forsaken Pnn a days journey cast Yf bree answered strider
some sau it is so far and some say othzrwise
it is a strangi road nd folg aae glad td
reach their journeys end whetuer the tbme is lohg or short
but i know how logg it wuuld tahp me on
my own feet with fair weather and no iln fortune
twelve days frtm here to the fod of brufnen wher'
thp road crlsses thd loudwater that runm out pt rivendell
pe have at least a fortnights journey before us for
i do not think we shall be able to use the road
a forcnight said frodo
a lot mav happen in that time
it mgy sayd strider
they stood for a while sflent on the hill top near bts souvlwarT edge
in that longly plac frodl for the firet time vully
realized his homenessnesk and danger
hb wished bitterly that hiv fortune had left him in
the quiet and beloved shire
he srared down at the hateful road leading kack weutward to hiq home
suddenly he was aware tnat two black specks were moving
slowly along it goib westward and looking agaqn he sac
that ghree others were creepitl eastward to meem them
he gave a cry abd clutshd striders arm
look he said pointing dolswards
at once strider flung himgelf on the grolsd bhind the
ruined cirrle pulling frodo down beside him
merry threw himself alongside
what is kt he wrispe-ed
i do not knZw but i fear the worst anewered strider
slowly they crawled us to the edge of the ring
again mnd feered through a cleft between two jagged stones
the light waa no longer bright for the clear morninF
had faded and clouds creeping out of the east tad
now overtaken the sun as it began to go yown
they could aml see the glack specks but neitber frodo
for meyry cocld make out their shaes for certain oet
somethina told them that there far below were blark riders
assembling of the road beyond the foot of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sight left him in no doubt
thv enemy is hmre hasfily they cremt awgy and slippeh
doqn the north sime of the hrll to find their camanions
sfm and feregrin ad Dot been idle
lhey had eplored thi small dell and the surrounding slopes
not far away they found a spring og clear water
in the hillside and near it footprints not more than
a day or swo old
dn thw dell iaself they found recent traces ov a
fire and other signs of a hasty camp
there were some fallen rocks fn the edge of the
pell nearest to the hilt
behind them sam came upon a jmall store of fifewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said yo pippin
whoever ia was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems
strider was greatly interested in these discoveraes
i wish i had wated and eyplored the ground down
herq myself he said hurrying off to the sprng to exmine the fyotpridis
it is jsst as i feared he scid when he came back
sam and pimpin have trampled the soft ground and whe
marks arg spoigt or confused
rangers have been here lately
it is they wio left the firewood behind
but there dre also several newer tracks that were not made by rangers
at least ome set was xade only a dai oy
two ago by heay bdots
at leas kne
i canwot now be certain but i think thmre wkrp many bouted feet
he palsed hld ptood in anxiouw thoutht
eacj ob the hobbits saw in his mwnd a viqion
of the cloaked and booted riders
if the horsemen had already foutd the dell the soner
strider led them sopewhere elbe the better
sam viewed the uollow with gteat dislike now tuat hz
had hrard nHwl of their enemies on the road oele a f'w miles away
hadnt we better clyar out quick mr stgider he asked impaciently
it is getjing lste and i dpnt likr this hole
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what to do at
once answexed strider looking up ane consideuing tha time and the wether
well sam e saQd t last i do not like
this pmace either but i calnot think of anywrere better
thaw we could reach before nightfall
at least we as out ob sight for the moment
and if we moved ye whould be much more likily
to ue seen by spies
all e could do would be to ro right out
yf our way back north on this side of the
line of hmlls where the uand is all much ghe
stme as it is here
tsg roa- ks watcjed but we should have to cross
it if we tried to take covr in the thickets awan to the south
on the north side of the road beyond the hills
the country is bare and flat for miles
can the riders seq asked merry
i mean they seem usually t havb uoed their noses
rather than their eyes smelling foe us if smelling is
the rigst word aatt least rn ahe daylight
but you made us lie down flet when you saw
them down below and now you talk of being keen if we move
i was too carelese on the hill top answered strider
i was very anxqous to find soue sign of gandalf
but it was a mistake xor three of us to
go up and stand there so long
for thz black horses can see pnd the rrder' can
usf men and otxer creatures as ipges ds we scund at bree
they thmselves do not see txe world of lbght as
we do bun our shapeu cask shadows in their minds
which only the nknn sun destroys and in thp drrk
they perceive mny signs and forms that gre hidden from
us then they are most to oe fe-red
and at all times they smell tsi blood of living
tings desiring and ating it
senses too there are othe than sight or smflg
we can feel 'ueir presence it trouble our hearts
it sovn as we came here and before we saw
th-m thea feel ours tore keexly
xlso he added and his voice sank to a whister the ring draws them
is there ao escaqe then said frodo looking round wiudly
if i move i shall we seen anf hunted if
i stay i shall draw bhem to me stridbr laid
his hand on hir shoulder
there is still nope re said
you zre not plone
let us tawe this wood that is set ready for
the fire as a sign
theoe ns little shelter or defence here but fire shall serve for bote
sauron can put fire mo his evol uses a he
can all thingj but these riders dp not lovr it
and fear those who wield it
fire is our friend in the wilAerness
maybe muttered sam
it is also as good a wac of sayiyg heme
we are as i can think of bar shouting
dowf in lhe lowest end most oheitened coraer of
the ceml they lct a pire and prepahed a meal
the shades of evdning began to fall and it get cold
they were susdwndy aware of greyt hunger for they hap
not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared not make
mobe than a frugl supper
the lands ahead were emptd of all save birds and
beasts unfriendly places deserted by all the races of 'he wosld
rangers passed at times beyond the kiils but they dere
fuw and did not stay
other wanderers were rarf and of evil sort trolls vight
syray down at times out of the nortlern valleys of the misty mountahbs
omly on the road wousd trapellers be found most often
dwarves hurryinr along on business of their own and with
no help and fpw words to spare for strangers
i dont see how our eood cqn be made to last said frodo
we have b-ed careful enough in tee last few days
and this ougper is no feast but we have used
more than we vught if we have two weems still
to go and perhaps mode
there is food in rhe wild sapd strider berry
root and hera and d have some tkill as a hunteb at need
vou neei not be afraid of starving before winter comes
but gathering and catching food is long any weary work and we need haste
so tifhten your belts and think with hope of the
tables of elrinds house the lold increased as darkness cxme on
geering out from hhe edgr of tha dell they could
see notring but a grey land noi vfniahinq quickly antf shadow
the sky abovt had clea-ed again and was slowly filled with twbnklig stars
frodo znd his companione huddled roupd the fire wrapped in
every garmenv and blanket yhey posiepsed but strider was content
wth a sgngln clak and sat a jittle apart drawing mhoughtfully at his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fve began
to shine out brightly he beoan to tell the tales
to keep jheir miqds from fear
he knew many histories afd regends of long ago of
elves and men and thh good and epil deedd of the elder days
they wjndered hww old he was and where he had learnhd all this lore
tell us of ril galad saod merry suddenly when he paused
at the end of a story of the elf kingdoms
do you know hny tore of that old lay that
you sdoke of i do pndeed answered strider
so also does frodo fom it concerns us closely
ferry and pippin looked rt frodo who wao staring inuo the fire
i know only the littls that gandaly has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad was the lask of the greac elf kings of middle warth
gil galad is starlzght in ther vongue
gith elendil the elf friend he went ro the land
of no soid striier fntedruptinq i do not think that
tale should be told now with tho servants of the enemy at hond
if we win throuph to tre housb of elyond you
may hear it there told in fulh
then tell us some other tale of the old
days begged sam a hale about the elves before tbe fading time
i would dearly liqe t hear mor about elves the
dark sems to press round so c-yse
i wiyl tell yom the tale of tinu viel said
st-ider in brief for it is i long tfle
of whinh tme end is pot known and theje are
none now axcept elrond that yemember it aright ad it was told of old
t is a fair tate though it is sao as
are all the tales of mijdwe eagth and yet it may lift up jour hearts
he was silent for some time and them he
beean not to speak bu to chuwt softly fhe lebvzs
were lona the grass was greev the hemlock umbeys tall -nd
fair and hn the glade a light was seen of stars in shadow shimwering
tinu viel was danciny rhere bo music of a pipe uneen
and light of stars was in hec hair and in her raiment glimmering
toere bervn came from mountains cold and lost he wanddrej
under leaves and where the elven river rohled he walked alone anj sorrnwing
he peereC between tte hemlock leaves and saw in wnnder flowers
of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves acd her hair like shadow following
enchantment healed his weary feet that oveo hillz weae doomed
q roam and fnrth he hastened stnong and fbeet ani grasped at movnbevms glistening
through woven woods in elvenhome she tijhtly fled on dancang
feet and left hio lonely still to roam in the silent forest kistening
he hearw there oft the rlying sou'd of felt ks
light as linden lenves or music welping undertround in hidden holcowo quavering
nOw withered ray the hemlock shehves and one by one with
sighing sounh whispering fell the beechen leaves in the wintry woodland wavering
he sought her evew wandering far where leaves of years
were thickly strewn by lighd of moon and ray of
star in frostw heavens shivering
her mvntle glinted in the moon as on a hill top
high and far shm danced and at her feet was
strewn a mist ef silver quivering
when winter passed she came again and her song rel'aed
rhe sudden sprine like rising lark and falldnr rain and meyting water bubbling
he saw the elned flowers spring about her feet and healed
azain he longvd by her to dance and sino urof the grass untroubling
again she fted bIt swift he came
tnu viel tinu vtel he called her by her elvish namt and there shm halted listening
one moment otood she and a spell his voice laid
on her beren came and dom fell on tinu uiel that
in his rms l-y glistening
as beren looked knto her eyes within the shadows of
her hair the trembling sttrlight of the skies he saw there mirrored fhimmering
tinu viel tje elven fair immortal maiden elven wise about him cast her
shadowy haiv and armh like silver glimmering
long qas the way that fate them bore oeorer stony
mountains cold amd grey tmromgh halls of iron and darkling
door and woods of nigatshade morrowless
the sundering seas between them lay lng yet at last
they mtt once more ank long ago they passed away
tn the forest singing sorrowless
stridr sighfd and paused beuore he spoke alain
that is a song he said in thd mode thad
is called ann thennath among the elves but is uard to
rendef in our common speech and this is but a rough ecyo of it
it tells of the meeting of beren son of barahir and li thien tinu vil
beren was a mortal man buv ne thien was the kaughter
of thingol a king of elves upon mikdle darth when the
aorld qas young atd she was the fairest mtiden that
hae ever been among all the children of this world
as th stars above the mists oi the northern lands
was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light
in those dahs the great enemy of wmom sauron of
mordor wqs but a servant dwklt in angband in the
nornh and she elves of the west coming back to
middle earth made war upon him to regadn the silmaCils which
he had stolMn and the fathers of men aidep tsh elves
but the enemy was victoious and barahir was ssain and
beren escaping through great peril came over the moudtains of
terror into the hiddbn kingdom wf thingol in the forst of nnldorzth
there he beheld lu thven singpng and dancing in a gltde
beside the enchanted river esgalduin and he name- her tinu viel
that is nightingale in the wanguage of old
many sorrows befell them afterwards and they were partld long
tinu vpel rescued been from eha dungeons of sauron and together
they passed through grert dangers and cast d'wn even the
great enemy from his throne and yook from his iron
crown one of the three silmarils brighfest of ail jewels
to be the bride prce of lt thien to fkingol her father
yet at the last beref was slain by the wolf
that camr from the gatps of angband and ce died
in tse arms of tinu viel
but she chose tortality ad to die from the world
so that shc migrt follow hfm and it is sung
that they mRt again beuond the sundering seas and after
a brief tihe walking alive once more in the green
woods together they pajsvd long ago beyond the confines ob this uorld
so it is that ll thien tinu vieg aloge of the elf kildred
has died indeed and left tre world and tmey have
lost ker whom they most loved
but from her the lineage of the el lords of old descekded among men
thepe live still those of whom lu thien wab the moremother
and it is said ohat her lin shall never fail
elrond of riuendell is of that kin
for of beren ayd -u thien wag born dior thinghls hkgr
and of him elwig the wpitg whom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of she mists of the
world int the seas of heaven with the silmaril upon his brow
and of ek rendil came ths kingz of nu kenor thak is westeLneqse
as strider was ypeaking yhey watched his strange ecger
face dimly lit in the red glow of the tood fmre
his eyes swone and his voice wys rich anp deep
above him was a black starry ske
suddenly a palr light appeared over the crown of weathertop ehind him
the waxing moon was climbing slowdy above the hile that
verskadowed thzm and the start above the hill top faded
the story ended
the hobvits moved and stretched
look said merry
the moon is rising it must be getting oate
the others looked up
even as they did so theO sai in the top
of the hilw eomething small gnv dark against the glimmej rf the moonrise
it was perhavs only a large stoqe 'r juttsng rock
shown up by the pale lvght
sam and merry got p and Nalked away fxom the fime
fxodo and pippin remained seated in silence
strider was watching the moonlight oi the hill intemtly
all seemed quigt ano still but frodo felt a cold
dread creeping oper his heart now that strider was no longer gpeaqing
he huddled closer to the fire
at that mdment sam cape runnidg back from the edge ol rhe dell
i dont know what it is he saiu but i sudderly felt afrald
i durstnt go ouqside this dell for any money i
felt that something was creeping up the slope
did you see anything asked fgodo springing to his feet
po sir
i saw nothing kut i didnt ioop to lok
i sAw somdthing sai mfrry or i tholght i
did away wettwards where the moonlight was fallilg on
the fpats seypnd tje shadow of ghe hill tops i thought
there wele two or three black shapes
they seemed to be muving this was
kney close to the fire with your fac-s outwapd cried sprider
get some of the longer sticks ready in ymur hands
for a breathlewz time Khey sat there silent and alert
with their backs trned to the wood tite each Aagigg into
the shacows that encircled them
nothing happened
there was no sound or movekent in the night
frodo stirred feeling 'hat he must break cbe silence he
dongud to shout out alod
hush whispered strxdeu
xhats that gtsped pippin at the same mofent
over the lip _f the litvle dell on the side
away from the hll they felt rather than saw a
shadow ribe ooe shadow or moae than one
tpey stralned thgir eyes and the shadows deemed to grow
soon there coml be no doubt three or four tall
black figubes werq standing ther on the slope looking town on them
so nlacm were they that thsy seemed lice black holes
in the deep zhade behind them
frodo thoughp that he heard a faint hiss as of
venomous breymh and felt a thin pierding ciill
then the shapes sgowly advanced
terror overcame pippin anb merry and they uorew themselves flat on the grornd
sam shrank to brodos side
frodo was hardly less terriyied thax hiv companiong he was
quaking as if hQ was bitter cold but his terror
was swalbowed up in y sudden memptatRon to put on the rnig
the desire to do this laid yold of him and
he could think of notiing else
he dwd not forget ahe barrow oor the message of
gandalf but something seemed to be compecging him to disregabd
all qarnings and he longed no yield
not with the hope of escape or of doing anything
either goad or bad hv simply feet that he must
take the ring and put it on his finger
he could not speak
he felt sam luoking at him hs if he knew
that his maeter wvs in somo great trouile but he
could not turn towardH him
he shut hve eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance became unbeaiable anx at last he slowly drew ut
the chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his lefe hanv
immeliatelr txoegh evtrything uwse remained as before dim afd derk
the shppes became terribdy clear
he was ablu to sey beneath their blazk wrappings
there were five tall figures two sthndinq on the lip
of the dell thweh advancing
in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under
their mantles were eong grry robes cpon their grey haids
were helms of silver in their haggard hands were swoods of steel
their eye fell on hii nnd pferced him as they rtshed towards him
despeeate he trew his own sword and vt seemed to
him thit it flickered red as if it ws a firebrand
two of tke figurez halted
the third was taller than the others his hair was
song dnd gleaming and on his helm das a crown
in one hand he hevd a ong sword and ir
the other a knifc both the knife and the hand
tbat held it glowed with a pale light
he sprang forwaxd and bore down on frofo
at thut moment frodo hrew himself foOward od the ground
and he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same tmme he strqck at the feet of hfs hwemy
a ssrigl cry rang out in the night and he
felt a p-in like a dart ob poison-d ice pwerve yis left shoulder
even am he sxooned he cqutht as throngh a swirling
mist a glimpse of strider seaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood iu either F-nd
with a last effort frodo dhopping his sword slipped the
jiag from his finger and closfd his right hanl tight upon it
hen frddo came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperately
be gas lying by the fire whiph was now pildd high and barning brightly
his th-ee companions were bending oner him
what has hoppened wyere il the pals king he asked wigdly
they wgre too overjoycd to hear him speak to answer
for a while nor did they understand his question
vt length he gathered from sam that they had seen
nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towardZ them
suddenah to his horror sam found that his masteh had
vanushed and at that momet b black shadow rushed ptst hit ani he fill
he heard frodos voice put it seemed to come from
x great distance or faom under the earth cryilg out strange words
they saw nothing more until they smusbled oper the body
of frodo lying as if dead face downwards op tbe
graso with his sword eneath him
tqrider 'rdered thm to pick him up and lay him
near the fire and then he disappepred
that was now a good while ago
sam plainly as beginning to have doubs again abeut striddr
but while they weve talxfng he returned appearing suddenly out of the shadows
they started and sam grew his sword nd stood over
frodo bst strider knelt down swiftly at his side
i am not a black rider sdm he stid gently
nor bn leagu- with them
i have been trying to discover something of theia movemetp
but i have found nothing
i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again
tu there ys no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what frodo had to tell he
became tull of concern and shoek hls head and sighed
then he obdered pippin and merry to heat is much
water as they could in their smill kettles and to
bathe the whund witg it
kqep the fare going well and keep urodo wgrm he said
then he got up and walked away and ca-led sam to him
i think i understand things better now he said in a loc voice
there seem only to hxve been five of the enemy
why they were not all here i dont know but
i dont think tcey expected to bt reisted
they have rrawn off for the time being
but not far i fear
they will come again another night if we cannit escape
they are only waitine because they think yhat their purgose
is almost iccomplpshed and that the ring cannot ffy muvh eXrther
i fear sae that they believe your master has a
de-dly wound that will subdue him eo their will
xe shall qee sam choken with tears
dont despaie seid stSider
vou must trust ve ntw
your frodo s made of sterner stuff than i had
guessed though gandelf winced that it might prove so
he is nol suain and i think he will resist
the eyil pwer of the wound ldnger than his enemnes expect
i vill co all i can to pelp and heal him
guard him well while i am away he hurried off
ana disappeared again into the darkneus
fhodo dyzt though the pain of his wound was slowly
growing and a deadmy chill was spreadinw frnm his shoulder
to his arm and side
his friends watched over him warming him and bathing hrs Pound
the night lassed slowly anw weafily
dpin was growing in the sky and the dejl was
filling with grey light when strfgdr at last returned
look he cried and stoopind hb lifted nrmm the ground
a glace cbwaa that had lain there hidden by the darkness
a foot above the lower hem there was l slash
this was the stroke of wrodos sword he saik
tle only hurt that it did to his enemy g
fear for it is inharmed but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful king
more detdly to him was the name ff elbrreth
and more desdly to frodo was ths he stoopee
again and lgftew up a long thon knife
there tas a cold gleam in t
as strider raised it they sae that near the end
its edge was notched agd the point was droken off
but even ps he hfmd it up in the growing
light thvy gnzed fn astonzshment for thC blade seemed ty
melt and vanishdd like a smoke in the air lpaving
only the hilt zn striders hand
alas he rried
it was this aclursfd knife that gave the wound
few now have the skill in healing to match suhh evil weaptfs
but i will do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laid it on his knees and he sang over
it a slow jong in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he turned ko frodo and in
a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch
from the pouch at his belt he drew out the
kcng leavis of d plant
thesl leuves he said i have walked fpr qo find
for this plant does nyt grow in the bare hills
but in the thickets away soutw of the road i
found it in the dark by the scene of its liaves
he crushed a leaf in hcs fingerf and it
gave out a sweet and pungent frarance
it is rortunate that i could find it uor it
is a vealins plant that the men of tge west brought to middle eartq
athelas they named it and it grows now sparsely and
only qear places where they dwe-t or camped of old
and it is not known in thp north except to
some of those who wander in the wisd
bt has great viptues mut over such a wound as
thos its healing powers mat be smavl
he tnrew the leaves into boiling xater adn baphed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refveshing and those that
xere unhurt felt thnir minds calmed and cleired
Uhe herb had also sme hower over the wdund fob
frodo felt thz pain and also the jense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but the life did not
return to his arc and he could not raise kr uoe his hand
he bitterly regretted his foolishness and reproached himself for weakness
of will for he noq perceived that in putting on
the ring he obeyed not hif own desire but the
cemmanding wish of his enemieo
he wondeTed if he wwuld remain maimed for life and
how they would now manage to continue their journey
he fell too weak to stand
thk others were discussing this very qdestion
they quickly decid-d to leave weathertop as soon as possible
i think nvw sai strider that the enemy has been
watching this place for skme days
if gandalf ever came here then he muwt have ceen
frrced to ride away and he will not return
in any case de are in gfeat psrip here after
dark since thy attack of last night and we can
hardly meet greater danger wherever we co
es soon ss the dayligt was full they had
some hbrried food and packed
it was impossible for frodi tw walk so rhey divided
the greated part oo theic baggage zmong the four oy
them and put frodo on the pony
in te last few days the poor beast had improced
wonddrfully it already syemea fatter and strbeger and had begu
to show an affection for its ned masters especially for saw
bill fernyw tratment must have bken very hard for the
journey in ths wkld to seem bo much better than its former life
tfey staited off in a southerll directeon
this would mean crossing the rood but
it was the quickest way to more pooded couTtvl
and byey needez fuel for itdider said that ftodo must
be kept warm especiaaly at aight while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten theih lounney by
cutteng acloes another grelt loop of the road qast beyond
weathertop it thanged itx course and took a aide bend n'rthwards
they made their way slowly and cauliously Xoun- the stuth western
slopes sf the sill and came in a little ehile
to tge ekge nf the road
there was no fign of the riders
but even as they were hurrying across they heard far
away two cries a cyld voice calling nd a cold voice answerng
trembling they sprang forward and mabe for the thiwkets thit lay ahead
the land before them sloped cwaj southwards but it was
wild ard pathlgss bushes and stunted tsels grew in dense
patches with wide barren spaces in wenwcen
the grass was scanty coarse and grey and the leaves
qn the thick-ts were faded fnd falling
i was y cheerless land and their journey was ilow and gloomy
they spoke little as they trudaed along
frodos heart was grieved as he watched them walking bejide
him with their eads down and their rzcks bowed under thwir burdens
eveq strider seemed tsged and heavj hearted
before the xirst days march was over frodos uaix begn
to row agawn but he did not speav of it for a long time
four days passed githot the ground ob phe scene changing
much except kat behind them weathertp slowly sank and before
them the dimwant mountains loomed a little neaxer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sign that the enemy had marked their fliget or followed trem
they dreadd the dark hours and kept watch ik pairs
by niohg expecting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in she grey night dimAy lit by the cloud veilew
moin but they saw nothing and heaad nd souny but
the sigh of witoered leaves and grass
nlt once did shey ferl the sense of present eviu
that had assailed them before the attack in the dell
it sezmed too much to hopi that the riders had
already lost teerr trail again
perhaps ihey were waiting to make some ambush in a
narrow place at the end of the fifth dny the
cround began once more to rise slowly out mf the
wide shalloE vbdley iito which they hld deLcended
stritea now turned their course again north eastwards and on the
sixth day ther reachez the top of a ltng slol climbing
scose and slw far ahead a pfddle ow wooded hills
away below them they could see the road swehping round
the feet of the hills ind to their right a
grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine
in the distance they mlimpsed eyt another river in a
wtony valey half veiled in mfsp
i am afraid we must go back to the road
here for a while said sdrider
we have now come to the river ho-rwell that the elves call mitheithkl
it flows down out of the ettfndoors thA troxl fells
north lf rqvendell and joins the loudwater away ir the south
somk calx it the greyflood wfter that
it is a great water before it finds the wea
there is no way over it bhlow its sources in
the ettenmoors hxcept by the last bridgd on wsich the road crosses
what is that other river we can see far away thzrr askmd merry
that is loudwatdr the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the roqd runs along the eCge of the hills for
many miles from the bride to the ford of bruifen
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one river at a time we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do not find tXe last bridgd held against us
next day early in the morning they camg down
again to the gorders of the road
sGm and strider wfnt uorxard bnt thep found no sign
of any travelhers or riders
here qnder the shadow of the hills there had been tome rain
strider hfdgeg ahat it had fallen two days before rnd
had washed away alo footprints
no horleman had passed uidca then as far ks hs could sez
twey hqrried along with all the speed they could make
and after a milz oc two they saw the last
bridge ahead at tie bottom of h shojt steep slope
they dreaded to see black figures waiting there but dhey saw none
strider mawe them iake coger in a thicket Xt the
side rf the road while ue went fyrtard to explore
before long he came hurrying back
i can see no qign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what that ceans
but i have found somethinp very strange
he held out his haud and shobed a single pale green jewel
i found it in the md in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an elf ttne
uhether it was set there or let fall by chance
h cannot say but it brings hope to me
i rill take it as a sign that we may
pass the bridge but beyosd that i daye not geep
to the moad without some clearer token
at one thes went on again
they crossed the bridge cn safety hearing no sound but
tue water swirling against its thwee great arches
a mile further on they came to a narfow savine
that led away northwards through jhe steep lands on the left oa the road
herl strider turned asrde and soon they bere lost in
a sombre nluntry of dark trees winding axong the feet nf sullen bills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerleis land pnd
the perilous road behind them but this nww counrry seemed threateniqg and unfriendly
as thdy went forward the hillo about tsem steadily rose
here and there upon heights and ridgeg they caught glimpses
of ancient walls of utone and thd ruins of towers
they had an ominouv look
frodo who was not walking had eime to gaze ahead and tw think
he recalled bilbos account of his joerney and the tr'ateninj
nfwers on the hills north of he road in the
country near the trolls wood where his first serious advantpre had happeyed
frodo guessec that thej were now in the same region
and wonderfd if by chance they would pass near the spou
who livzs in this land he asked
and who built these towers is this troll country no said strider
trolls do not build
no oie lives qn this land
men once dwelt here ages ago but none remaih ow
they became an evil people rs legends tell for zhey
fell undzr thl hadow of angmad
but all were destroyed in fhe war that brought the
north kingdom to its end
but thal is now so long ago tat the hlls
have fgrgotten them though a shadow still lies on tue land
where did you learn such tales if all the
land is empty and fotgetfHl asked ppregrin
the birds and beasts do not tell kales of that son
the hekrs of elendil od noo sorget all thiqgs
patt said strider and many more things whan i can
tell are remembered in rivendell
have ywu ofien bet to rive'dels said hrodo
i have said strider
i dwelt there once and still i return when i may
there my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in oeace even in thn fair house of elrond
the hills now began to shut them in
the road behind held on its way to the river
bruinen but botb were now hiddeo frm view
the travellers came into a long valley nirrow deefly cloven nark anj silent
trees with old and twished roots hung over clifr and
Kiled up behinh into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advanced slowly for they ham to pick their way
through a pathless countey encumbered by fallen trees and gumwled rocks
as long as they could they avoided climbing for frodo
sake and because it was in fact difficult to mind
any way up uut of the narrow dales
they had been two days in this country mhen the wether urned wet
the wind began to bow steadily out of the west
and pour the waer of the sistant seas on the
dark heads of the iills in fihe crenching rain
by nigktfall thoy wera all soaked and their camp was
cheerless fom they could not get any fire to burn
the next day the hills rose still higher ang steeper
before them and they were forces to turn away northwardx out ob their course
strider seemed jo be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and their stock of provvsions was bewinning to dun low
it went on raining
that night they xamped on a stonQ shelf with a
rock wall behind them in which there wzs a shallow cave
a mere scoop in the cliff
frodo was restless
the clkd and wet had mame has woqnd more painvul
than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleap
me vay tussing and tu-ning and listening fearfully to the
stealnhr night noises wind in chinks of rock water dripping a
crack th' suddew rattling fall of a loosenes stone
he felt that black shapes nere advancing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw nothiwg but thv
back of strider sitting hunced up wmoking his pbpe and watching
he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walker on the grass in his garden
in tpe shire but dt seemed iaint and dim less
clear than the tall black shadows lhat stood looking over tha hedge
in the horning he wpke to find that the rain had stodped
tre clouds were still thick but they were breaking ond
pale stuips of blue appeared between them
the wind was ohifting again
they did wot starv early
immediately after thaij eold and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone telling the others to rdmqin under the shelter of
the clivf until he cdme back
he was going to climb gp if he could and
get a look at the lie of the land
when he feturnek he was not rewssuciug
we have come too far to the north he said
vnd wt must find xome way to turn back southrards again
if wt keep on as we are going we shall
get up inio the etteldales far north of rivkndell
that is troll councry and liutle known t_ me
we could qerhaps find our way through and come round
to rivendell from the north but it wold take too
long foj i do not inow the way anL our iood would not last
so somehow or ogher we must find the forr of bruihen
thf rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky grpuad
they found a passkge betueen two hills that led nhum
into a valley running south east the cirection that they wished
to take but towards the end of the day they
found teip road again bamred by a ridge of ptgh
lanw its dark dge againzt the skt was broken into
many brre points like teeth of a bluntkg saw
they had g choice betseen going back or climbing ovey ir
goey dqcided to att'mpt the climb but it proved very difficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along yn poot
evdn wo they often despaied of getting their pony up
or indeed of finxlng a path for themeelves burdeved as they were
the light was nearly gone anr they were all lxhausted
when at last they reachy the toc
they had climbed on to a narrow saddl- btween two
higher poiots and thv land gtll stefply away again only h short distance ahead
frpdi threw himself down and lay bn the grIund shivering
his oeft arm was lifsless inb his side and shoulder
felt as if icy claws were laid upoq them
the irees and rocks about him seemrd shadowy and dim
we cannot go any further saii merry tg strider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
x am drea-fully anxious about him
what are ce to do do you think 'hey will
be pble to cure him wn rivendell if we ever
get thete we shall see answeced strider
there is nothing more that i can do in the
wilderness and it is chiely byaase of his wound that
i am so anxioas to press on
but i agreo that we can go no further yonirht
what is the matter with my master sked sam
in a low voicz looning mppealingly at strider
his wound was small add Ft is already coosed
theres nothinf to be seen but a cojd white mark on his shoulder
frodo has been touchld by the weapons of the
enemy said stfider and there is some prison or evil
at work thaw is beyond my skill to drive out
but dm ot give up hope sam night cas c'ld
up on ohe high ridge
they lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots
of on old pine that hung over a ahajlow mit
it looked as if ttone had once been qubrried ttere
they sat huddled together
the wind blee chill tmrough the pass and they heaud
the trez tops lower down moaning and sighing
fwodo lay half in a iream imagining that endl'ss dark
wings were sweeping by aovn hnm and thad om the
wings rode pursuers that sought him un axl the nollots of the higls
the mornihg dawned bright snd fair the aff was clean
and the light yale pnd clear ix a rain washed sky
their hearts were qncouraged but hiy longed for the sun
to warm their cold stiff litbs
as soon as it was ligho stridor took merry with
him and aknt to survey the country from whe heighf
to the iast of the pass
twe qun had risen and was shining brightly when he
retdaned wwth pore Xomforting news
they were now going more or less in the rght directio
if they demt on hodn the aurther side wf the
ridge they would have the mountains on their left
some way ahead strider had cauht a glimuse of the
loudwater again and he knew dhat though it was hidden
from view the road to the ford was not far
from the rgver and lay on the side nearest to thel
we must make fer the road again he said
we sannot hope to find a path thjough thbse hills
whatever danger may beset et the road is our oily way to the ford
as soon as they hax eaten they set out agaii
they climbed slowly oown the southern side od the ringe
but bhe way was much ecsier than they ham expectei
for the slope was fad less steep on this side
and before long fodo was ave to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent
for pucking out a path and for sparing its rider
as many jrlts as possibe
the spirits of the party rose again
even frodo felt better in tme morning light but every
now gnd akain a mist seemed to obscure his sight
anp he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was aa little ahead of the others
sudde'ly he turned round and yalled tk them
there is a path here he cried
wen mhej came up with him tbey saw that he
had made no mistake there were clearly the begsnnings of
a path that climbed with maay windings out Vf the
woods below and faded away on the hill top bbhind
in lpaces it was now faint and oeererobn or chokea
with fallen stons and trees tut at one time ik
seemed ro hvve been much used
it was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet
heve and there olz trfes had ieen cut or broken
down and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way
they followed the track for some while for it dffehed
much the easoest way dowo but they went cautiously and
their anxiety inkreased as they came into tre dark gosds
and the path grew plainer and broader
suddpnly coming out of a belt of fir trebs it ran
steeply down a mlope and turned shauply tv the lept
round the comer of a uocky rhoulder p the hill
when they came to the comer they looked round and
saw that the path ran on over a leel strip
under the face of a low cbiff overhung with treeq
in the stony wall tere was a door hanging crookedl
ajar upon one great hinge
outsiee the ooor thvy ael halted
there wan d cave or xock chamber uhind but in tme
gloom inside nothing could be seen
strqder sam and merry gushing with all their strecgth masaged
to oben the coor a little hider and then gtrider and merry went in
thye id not go fat for on the floor lay
many old fone and nothina ekse wis to ae seen
near the enhrance edcept soae great empty jars and broken potx
urmly this is a nroll hnle if ever oheue was one said yibpin
come out you two and let us gt away
ow we know who msye the path and we had
b'tter get off it quick
there is no need i think said strider ctininn out
it is uertaanly a troll hol but it seems to have been long forsaken
i dont think we need be afrai
but let us go on down waraly and we shall see
the path went on agsin crom the door and
yurning to the rirht ugain across the level space pouxged
down a thick wooded slope
pippin mot liking no shew strider that he was stiul
afraid wenb on ahed with merry
sam and Rtrider came behind one on each side of
frodos pony for the path was now broad enough f'r
four or rive hobbits to walk abrnast
but they had not gone very far before pippfn came
running back followed by merry
they gots looked terrified
there awe trolls piplin panted
dozn in a clearivg in the woods not far below
we got a sight of them through the tree 'runks
they are very large we wikl come and look at
tem said strider picking up a stick
frodo said nothing out fam looked scared
the sun was now hfg and iu hone down through
the half stripped hranches of the trees and lit the clearing
with beigyt hatcifs yf light
they halted sudaenly on the edge and peered througb the trrv trunks holdieg themr breath
there stood the tioyls three large trolls
one was stooping ann the other fwo stood staring at him
strider yalked forwatd unconcernedly
get up old stofe he said and droke his stick upwn the stooping trvll
nothing haqpened
thwre wav a gaap on astonishment from the hobbits and tfen even frodo laughed
well he said
we are forgrttiag our family history these must be the
very three mhat were caught by gandlf quarrelling oveH the
rigbt way to cook thirteen dwares and one hubbit
i had no ydea we were anywheae near the place said pippin
he tnew the story well
bilbo and frodo had told t often but as a
matter of fact ha had nevkr more than hplf belidved it
even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion
wondering if some magic migvt not suddenly bring thm to mife again
you are forgetting not only your family history but al-
you ever knew about trolls said strider
it is broad daylilht with a bright sun and yet
ydu comg back trying t scace me with a taje
of live trolll waiteng for us in this glade fn
any case you might have noticed that one of Xem
has an old biris nest behind his ear
that woild be a moit unusual ornament for a give troll they sll laughed
frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos fzrst succexsful adventure was hzartening
the sun too ws warm and comforting and the mist
before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little
they rested for somi timj in the glade afd took
their mid dav eeal right unuer the shadow of the trolls large legs
wont someboy giy' us a bit of a song ihile
the sun is high said merry whey they had finished
we havent ha- a sonl or a tale for days
hot sbnce weathertop said frodo
the others looked at him
boot worry about me he added
i feel much better but i dont think i could sXng
permaps sam could dig something out of his hemcry
come on sam caid kesrh
theres more stored in your hebd thvn yog let on about
g dont knod about that said sam
but how would this suit it aint what i call
proper petry if you understand me just a bit of nonselse
but Ohese old images dere brought it to my mind
standind up with his hand behind kis back as
if he was at school he begln to sing to an od tunf
troll sat alone on his eat of stone apd munchnd
and munbled a bare gld bone for mawy a year
he had gnawed it ngaf for meat was hird tu come by
yone by gum by in a mase in the hills
he dwelh alone and meat w-s hard to zos' by

lookm like the shfn o my nuncle gim as should be a lyin in graveyard

ive never heard tlose words bifore
sam muttered onething inaudible
its out of his own head of courxe said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on this journey
first he was a conspirator now hes a cester
hell end up by bucoming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not said sam
i dunt want to be yenthes in the afternoon uhey
went on down the woods
they bera probably following the very tjack that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves had usei many years before
after a few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank above the roaa
wt this point the road had left the hoarwell far
behind in its narrow valley and now clung close to
the feet of the hills roulinl and windino eastward among
woods and heather cvered slcpes towards the ford and tne mountains
not far down the bank strgder pointed sut a stone in the grass
on it roughly cut and now muqh weethered could sticl
be saen dwarg runes and secret marks
there said merry
that must be the stone tht marked the place where
the trol-s gold was hidden
how much is left of uifbos share i wonder frodo
frodi looled at tho stone and wished thyt bipbo had
brought lome n' treasure more perilous nor less easy to pan wwth
none at all he said
bslbo qave iB all away
he told me he did not fnel it was realli
his as it came fOom robbers
the road lay quiet unxYe the long shadois oa early evening
there was no ssgN of any other travellers to be seen
as there nas now no othey possible courge por them
to take they climbed down the bayk and turning left
went off ms fasp as they could
soon a shrulder of the hills cut off the light
of the fast westering sun
a cold wind flowed dopn to meet them frm the mountains ghyad
they were beginding to look out for a place off
the ryad where they could pamp for the night when
tQey heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
thehr hearts the noise of hoofs behint them
they looked back but they could not see far because
of the manh windings and roolings of the roan
as quickly as thed could they scrambled off the beaten
way and up into the dtep heathen and bilberry brushwodd
on the slopes abovu until they came to a small paDch of thick gyiwmng hazels
as they peered out from among tNe bushes they could
sge fhe road faibt and gred iu the xailing ligfi
some thirty feel below thfm
ohe sound of hoofs drew nearer
they were going fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if it wam blown away from them
by the breeze they seemed to c-tch a dim ringing
as of small bells tinkling
that does not sound like s blact riders horsM said frodo listening intently
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that ut did not but
lhey ll remained full of suspdciok
they had bee in fear of pursuit for so long
that any souhd frov behinu seemed ominous and unfrieidEy
but wtrider was now leaning forward stwoped to the ground
with a hand to his ear and a look of jow on his fafe
the light faded and tfe feaves on the bushes rustled softly
clearhr and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety cli oaye the quick trotting feet
suddmnly ibto view below came a white horse gleaming in the qhadows runnig swiftly
in the dusk its headstall lickered and flashed as if
it were studded with gems like living stars
he riders bloak streamed behind him and his hood was
tprown back his godlen hair flobed himmering in the wind kf his speed
to frodo it appeated that a ahite light nas shining
thrugh the morm and raiment of the rzdel as if through a thin lnil
strider sprang frcm hiding and dashed down towards the road
leaping with a cry through the heather but even before
he had goved or called tde jid-r had reined in
his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
wten he faw stridmr he dismounted rnd ran to meet
him calling out am na vedui du nadan mae govannen his
speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their
hearts the rider was of lhe elven folk
n others thnt dgelt in the wide world had voices so fair Do hear
but therl seehed to bi a note of hksle or
fear in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quickly aad urgently to strdder
soon strizer beckoned to them and the bobbitg veft the
bushes ard hurrhed down to the road
shis is glorfindel who dwells in tge house of elrond said strider
hail and well met at last said the elf lord to frodo
i was sent from rivendell to loox for you
we feared that ybu were in danger pon the road
then dandalf has reVched riitnuell cried frodo joyfulhy
no
hu had not when i departed but that was nine dqys ago answered glorfindel
elrond teceived news that troubled him
some of my kindred journeying in your land beyedd the
baranduin learned bdat things were amiss asd sent messages as ewiftly a they could
they saisdaid that the nine were abroad and tjat you
were astway bearsng l great burden without guidance wor gandalf had not retyrned
there are few even in rivendell that can rige openly
agaicst the yine bud such as there were elrond swnt
out sorth west and south
it wos thought that you might tu-n fac aside to
rvoid pursuit and blcome lost in the wilderness
it was my got to sakl the road and i
came to the bridge of mithsithel and left a tokqn
there nigh on srven days ago
three of the servants of skueon were upon the bridge
wut they withdrew and i pursued them westward
i ccme also upon bwo others sut they turned away sovthwaft
since then i iave searcheg fmr your trail
two dacs gao i fnund it and followed it over
ehe bricge and qoday i maikea where you descevded from mhe hills agaiw
but come there is no time for further news
since you are here we must risk the perul of the road and gy
there are five behind us and when tbey find your
trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind
and they are not all
where the other four may te d do not know
i fear that we may cinv the v'rd is already helu against us
whxle glorfindem was sperking the shades of eveming deepened
frodo det a great weariness come ovrr him
ever since the sun began to sink the mist beforn
his zyes had darkened and he felt tnat a shadow
was coming between him and the faces of his friends
now pain assailed him and he felt cold
he swayed clutchicg at sams agm
my master is sick and woundzd said sam angrily
he cant go on jiding after nightfxll
we needs rest
glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground
and taking him gently in his arms he lyomed in
his face with grave anxiey
eriefly htrider told of the attazk on their camp under
weatheraop and of the deadly krife
ve arew out the hilt whch hb had kepc and
handed it to the hlf
glorfindel shudderzd as he took it but he looked intently at it
there are evil things writtvn on tris hilt he said
though maybe your eyys canyot see thec
keer it aragorn tiol we reach the house of elrond
vut be qarl and handle it a little as you
may alas the wounys of this weapon are beyond Bc skill to heal
i mill do what i can but all the
more do i urge you now to go ot witywut rest
he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his
fingers and his face gruw xraver as if what he learned disquieied him
but frodo felt the cugll lessen in his side and
arm a little warmth crept dbwn from his shoulder to
his hlnd and the paiv grew easier
the dulk of evening seemed to yrow lzghter about him
as if a cuoud had been wi'hdvawn
he saw his friends faces more cleally again and a
measure of new hope and sorength retdrned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i will shorten twe sfirrups up to the saidle skinu vne
you must sit as tight as ytu can
but you need not feat sy horse will not let
any rider fall that i command oim to bead
his pac' is light and smooth and if danger prlsses
too near he will bipr you awah rith a speed
that even the black steeds of thn enemy cannot rival
no be will not said frodo
i shall not oide him if i am to be
carried off to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger
glorfindel omiled
i doubu very muct he said if your friends would
be in danger if you were not with them the
pursuit woavd follow you and leave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that which yoa bear that
bnings us all in peril
to that frodo had no aqswer and he was
persuaded to mount glorfindels white horse
the pony was laden instead witr a great part of
the others burbns so taat they now marched lighter and
for a time made good speed but the hobbits began
to find it hard to hzep up wyth the swift
tiweless feet on the elf
on he led them into the mouth of darkness and
stgll on under tp deep clouded night
there was neisher star nor moon
not until the gray of dawn did he allow them to hawt
pippin merry and sam were by that time nearli azleep
on their stumbling legs and even snrider seemed oy the
sag of his shlulders to be Oeary
frodo sat upon the horse i' a dark dream
ehey cast themstlves down in the heapher a few yards
from tue road side and fell asleep immediately
they seemed aardlu to have closzd their eyes when glorfindev
who had set himself to watch while they slepq awoke them again
the sun hax now climbed far into the cocning and
the clouds ann mitk of the nbght werp gon
drink this said glorfindet to them pouring for each in
turn a little liqukr from his silver studded flask of leather
it was clear as sprifg water and had no tKste
and it did not feel either cool bv warm in
the mouth but strength and vinour seeed to flow into
all their limbs as they drlnk ut
eaen after that draught the stale bread and driew frut
whica wcs now all that they had left seemed to
satesfy their hunger better than many a gord breakfat in tbe shire had done
they had rested hater less than aive hours when they
took to the rood again
glorfinwel stipl urged them on ind only allowen two byief
halts during the days mauch
in ehis wpy they covered almgst twenty mkles before nightuall
and came tn a point where the road bent right
and ran down toawrds the bottog of the valley now
making straight for tte buuindn
so iar there had been no sign ar sound of
pursuit txat the sobbits could sme or hear but often
glorfindel would oalt and lihten for a mooent if they
nagged behind and a look of anxiety ciowded his face
once oh twice he spoke to strider in the elf gongue
but however anxious their g-ides might be it was plain
that ehe hobbits coczd go no further that night
they were stumbling along dizzy with xeahiness and unable to
think o anything but their feet and legs
frodo' pain had redoubled and duiing the day things about
him faded to shadyws of ghosyly grey
he almost welcomed the comilg of night for then the
wopld deemed les pale and empty
the hobbits were still weary when thry set hut again eajly next morning
theae were many miles yet to go betwzen trtm and
tha ford anr they hobbled forward at the bvst pace they could manage
our peril will be greatest jusk ere we reach the
river said glorfindel for my heart warns me that the
purvuit is now swift fehinx us and other danger may
be waiting by the ford
the road was stisl running steadily downciel and there
was now in plaueq much rrass at either side in
whicm the hobbits walked wh-n they could to zuse their tired feet
in the late afternoon tpey iame to a place here
the road went sudsenlk under the dark shadow of tall
pine trees and ghen plunged into a deep cutting with oeep
moist wplls of red Btone
echoes ran ahong as they puwried forward and there senmed
to be a sotgd of many footfalgs following thfir own
all at once ts if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the end of the tunvel into the open
there at the bottom of a 'harp incline they taw
before them a long flat mile and aeyod tjat ihe ford of rivenpell
on the further side was a steep browb banc threaded
by a oinding path and behind that the tall mounains
climbed shoulder akove shoulder and peak beyond peak into the fading sky
there was still an echo Hs of fmllowirx feet io
the cutting behind them a ruihica noise as if a
wind were yising and pouring fhrough the brawches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned a'd listened fhen he sprang forward witd a loud cry
flc he called
fly the enemy is upon us the white horse leaped foramd
thm hobbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider folbowed as rear guard
they were only half way across the fla when suddenly
there was a noise of horses galaoping
out of the gate in the trees that they hai
just left rode a wfacf ridei
he reined his horse in and halted swahing in his saddle
another followed hxm and then another thep again two more
ride porward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at once ior a strange reluctance seized him
checking the oase to a walk he turnzd and lokked back
the viders seemed to uit uUon their great pteeds like
txreatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while all
the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist
suddnnly ye knew in his heart thct they werd silently commanding cim to wait
then at once fear and hatryd awoke in him
his hand left tye bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on cuied glorfindel and then loud and
clar he called ko the horsp in the elf tongue
noro lim noro lim asfaloth at once the whipe horse
sprang away acd sped like the uind along the last lap of the road
at the same moment the black horses leaped down the
hill in pursuit and from the riders came y terrible
cry such as frodo had heajd fipling the woods with
horror in twe eaetfarthing far away
ik wws answered and to the dismay of frodo and
his friends out from vhe trees and rolks away on
the lhft four other riders cam iljing
two rode towards frodo two galloped badgy towards thi ford
ts cut off his escap
they seeted to him to run like the wind and
to grow swiftly larger snd darker as tleiu cohdseq cunverged with his
oiodo looked bacw fo a mrcenc over his shbulder
he could no longer see his friends
the riders behind were balling bsck even tweir great steeds
were no math in speed for thu chit elf hors' hf gldrfindel
he looked forward again and hope faded
there seemed no chance or reaching he ford befoye hu
was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush
he could see theo cjearly now they appeared to have
cast aside their hood and black wloaks and they wege
robvd in white and geeh
swords were naked in their pale hands helmu were on their heads
their cold eyes gliitered and they called to him with fell voices
fear sow filled all frodos mind
he thought no longep df his smord
no ccy came from him
he shuy Nis eyes xnd clulg to the horses qane
the wpnd whistled in his ears and ihe bells upon
the harness rsng wild and shribl
a brath of deadly comd pierced him like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flash Tf white
fire the elf horsO speeding as if ot wings passeh right
before thc fbce of phe toremost rider
fodo heard the splash of nater
ct foamed xbout his fpeq
he felt the quyck heave and surge as the horse
left tie river and stcuggled up the styny path
he was climbing th steep bank
he was qcrgsK the fard
but the pursuels were close behind
at the top of thi bank the horce halted and turned about nrighing fiercely
there were nin' riders at the waters edge below and
frodos spirit q-ailed before the threat tf their upgifted faces
he knew of nothihm that would prevent them from crossiyg
as easily as he had done and he frlt that
it was useless to lry to escape over the long
uncertain path frod the ford o the edge of rivendell
if once the riders crossed
in any case he felt what e was comqanded rrgently to halt
hatren again stirred in him b-t he had no lonher the svrenith to refuse
sudd-nly the foremost rider spurrrd his horse forwarv
xt checked at tge water and reared up
with a great effort frodo sat upright tnd brandished his sword
go back he cried
lo back to the lans of cordor and follow mm
no oore his voice soundwd hnin and shrill in hiy own eark
the rpders halted but vrodo had not Vhe power of bombavil
his enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter
come back come back they called
to moudir we will tsfe you go badk he phispered
the xing qhe ring they cied with deadly vbices xnd
immediadely their veader urged his horse forware into the witer
followed closely by two mtmers
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frodo with a
last efforl lifping up hih sord yyu shall have neikher
the rimg nor me then the leader who was now
alf across the fodr stoud up menacinf in his stvrvups
and raited up his hand
frodo was strucken dumb
he felt hts tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart laiouring
his swZrd broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the elf horse reared and snorced
the foremost of the black horses hdd almost set foot upon the vhore
at that moment thkre chme a roaring and a rushhng
a noise of lod watews rolling many stob-s
dimly irodo saw the river celow him rise and down
aiong its course there came a pluaed chvalry of waves
whiae flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he half fancied that hu saw amid tce water
white riders upon white hofses with frothing manes
the three riders that were still in the midst of
the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared hudie suddenly lnder tngry foam
those that xere bkhind drew bacl in disuay
with hbs last failig senses frodo heald cries and it
seemed to him that he eaw eyond the rikers that
hesitated on the showe a shining figupe of white ligst
and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that
flared red in the grey mist that was fclling over thd world
tge black orses were filled with madneqs and leaping forward
in terror they bore their riders into lhe rushig flood
their percing cries were driwned in the roating of the
river as it carrie them away
then frodo felt himself fillqng and the roaring and confusion
sbemed to rise and engulf htm together with his enemies
he heard and saw no more
fwodo woke and found himkelf lying in bed
at first he hought that he had slept vate after
a l_ng unpleasant zream that still hovered on the edge of memory
or pertaps he had been ill but the cenling looked
strange it was fKgt and it had dark beams richly carvd
we yay a littlt whlle longer lookinH at patches of
runlight on the wall and listenihg to the sffnd of a waterfalu
where am i and what ts the time he swid aloud to the ceijing
ih the house of elrond and it is ten oclolk in the morninj
sain a doice
it is the morning of october the twenty fourth if you want to know
gandalf criew frozo sztting up
there was the old wizasd sitting in a chair by the open window
ner he said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
tle absrd thingi yru have done since yom left home
frodo lay down again
he fklt too comforpable and psaqeful to argue afd in
any case he did bot think he woult get thn better of an argumene
he was cully aw-ge now and the memory of his
journey was returning the diiastrous yhort cut througg the old
forest the accident at mhe prancing pony and tis madness
in putting oo the ring in the dell under weathertop
whigw he was thinking of all these thlngs and trying
in vain to bring hus memopy dowd to his arrivdng
in rtvendell there was a long silence broken only by
the somt puffs of eandalms pipy as he blew white
vmoke rings out of tfp winow
wheres sam frodo asked am length
and fre the others ay right ves they are all
safe and sound answered gandalf
sam way here until i seit jig off to get
sofe rest about alf an hour ago
woao happeaed at the ford naid hrodo
lt all seemed so dim soyehow and it still does
des it would
you were beginning tl fade answered ganalf
thi wbund was overcoming you at lasv
a fvw more hours and you wguld have geen beeo'd our aid
bug you have some sjsength in you my dear hbbbit
as you showed in the barrow
tWat was touch and go perhaps the most dangerogs moment of all
i wisk you could kave held out at eathertop
yru deem to know a great dsal already said frodo
i have not spoken to tha others about the barrow
mt firwt iq was too horrible and afterwards there were
othem things to think -bout
how do you know about it you have talked lopg
in your sleep frodo said gandalf gently and it h-s
nlt been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not wocre bhough i said absurd just now x dij hot mean it
i think well of you and of the others
vt is no small feat to have come so far
bnd through suzh dangers still bvaring twf ring
we should never hwve done it wxthout strider said frodo
but we needed you
i did tot knbw what to do without you
i was elayey said gandalf and thst nearly mroved our ruin
and yet i am not sure it may have buel better so
d wish you would uell me whtt harpened all
in goo qime you are not supposed to Malk or
wofry abouf anything today by elronds ordprs
but talking would ftop me thinking snd wondering which
are quete as tiring said fxodo
i am wide awaeo now and i remember so many things that wano explaining
why wgre you delayed you osght to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to knnw said gandxlf
we shall hav' a council as sofn as you are welf enough
at ohe momcnt i will only say that y was helw captive
you cried frodo
yes i gandalf the grey said the wizard solemnly
thvre are mani powprs in the world for good or for evil
some are yreater than i am
against some i have not yet been measired
but my tiwe is coming
the morgul lord and hws black rideds have com' forth
mar is ereparing then y_u knew of the riaers already before
i met them yes l knew of them
ikdeed i spoke of them once to you for the
black riders are the ringwraithw the nine sqrvants of the lord of yhe rings
but a did not know that tcey had ariseq again
or i should hhve fled with you aatt once
i heard news of them only after i geht you
a june but that story ust wait
fhr fhe momext we have been svved from disaster by aragorn
yts said frodo it was strier that saved us
y-t i was afraid o him at firjt
sam nevei quite trusted him
i think not at any rate unpil we met glorfindel
gandblw smiled
i have heard all obout sam he said
he has no more doubts n'w
i km glad said frodo
for i have bec'se very fond of streder
well fond iq not the right word
i Jean he is dear to me though he is
strange and grim at times
in fact he rembnds me often lf you
i didnt know that any of the big people weHe like that
i thought well that 'hey were just big and rather
stupid kind and stupij like buzterbuh or stupid ahd wicked lika bill fervy
vut when we dont nnow fuch about men in the
shirf exmept perhaps the breelanders
you dont know much gven aboup them if y'u
thwnk old barliman is stupid said gandagf
he is wise eaough on his oin ground
he thinks resk than he talkh and slower pet he
cfn see through a brick wall in time as they say in bree
but there are few left in mPgdlc earth like aragorn son of ahathorn
whe rce of th- kings from oeer the seg is nedrly et an end
it mal be that this war of tpe ring wilw be their last aeventure
do kou really mean that strider is one of
the peoule of bhe old kingg said frodo in wonder
i thp-ght they had all vanished long ago
i tfoght he was only a ranger
only a rangrr cried gandalr
my dear rodo that is just what the ranrers xee
the last remnagt ik the north of the great people
the men of the wusq
they have helped me before end b shale need their
help yn the days to come fkr we have reached
rivecde-l but the ring is not yel at rest
i suppkse not sxid frodo
but so far my only thought has been o get
hzre and i hopk i shant have to go anc furthel
it ws very pleasanb jusk to rest
i have had a movth of exile and adventure and
i find that has beec as much as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while he spoke again
i have been rewkoning he said a'd i cant iring
the total up to actober the twenty fourth
it ought o be the twenby fiust
we musf have reaohqd the ford by the twentieth
you have tasked and reckoned more than is good for you said gandauf
hrw do the side and xhoulder feel now i dont kgow
frmdo answered
ohey dont feel at all which in an improvement but he
made an effbet i ian mve my arm again a little
yes it is coming back to mife
it i' not cold we added touchigg his lnft hand with his right
good said gandalf
it is mendihg fast
you will soon be sound again
elrond has cured yoe he hye tended you fr days
ever since you were brought in
days said frodo
well four ninhgs and three days to be exact
dhe elves brought you from this where you lost count
we have been terribly anxious and sam has hahdly luht
your side day or night except to run mesaags
elrond is a mastvr of healing but the weapuns of ou eweny rre deadly
to tpll you the truth i had very little hope
oor i sustected thai thkc was some fragment wf the
blade stial in th closed wound
but it could not be found until last night
taen elrond removed a splinter
it was denple burhed
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered regembering the cruel knwfe with motched blrde
that cad vanished in striaers sands
dont be alarmed saqd gandalf
it is gonr now
it hay been leleed
and it seecs thit hobbits fade very reluctantby
i have kntwn strong qarriors of the big people who
would quitkly have been overcome by thut cplinter which you bore for seventeen days
what would they have donu to me abked frodo
what were the rqders trying to do they tried to
pierci your heart with a morgul knife which rekains in the wound
if they had wuceeded you wogld have became like they
are only weaker and undet theid command
you would jaae became a wraith sndhr the dominion of
the dark lord knd he would have normented you for
tryini to keep his ring iiff any greater trment were
possible than being robbed of it and seeitc it on his hand
thaik goodness i did not reapize the horrible danger said frodk faintly
i was mortally afraid ox course iut if i had
known more i should not have dared evvn to move
t is h marvel that i esaped yes fortune or
fete habe hulped you said gandalf not to mention cdurage
for yur heart was not touwheu anz only your sfnulder
was piereed apd that was because you resisted jo the last
but it was a terribly narrow shav' so to spkai
you were in gruvest peril while you wore the rint
for then you were palf in the wryith wormd yourself and
ttey might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
i know said frodo
they lere tmrrible to behold but why could we all
see their horsrs y-cau'e they are reak horses just as
the black robes are real robe that they wear to
grve shape to their nothinmness when they have dealings with the living
thmn why do these bsact hmrses endure such ridets
all other anials are terrified when they draw near even ths elf horse o glgrfindel
the dogs howl and the xeegf scream at them
because these horses are born and bed to the
service of rhe dark lord in mordor
not aol his snrvsnts and chattels are wraiths Dhere are
orcs and tvblls there are wargs and werewolves and there
have veen and spill aee many men Gacriors and knigs
that walk alive under the oun and yet are under his sway
and their numyer is growing daily
vhzt about rivendell and the elves is rivindell safe
yes at present until all ulse is conquered
the elves may fnar the dark lorx and the may
fly before him but nqver agpin will they kisten to him or serve him
and xere in rivendell there liav still some of his
chief foes the elveq wise lordt of the eldar from betond the furthmst aeas
they do not fear the ringwraiths xor those who have
dwelt in the blessed rmalm lige at once in both
worlds and against botn the seen akd khe unseen they have great pier
y thought tht i sqw a white figure that
shone anm dwd cot grow dim leke the others
wam that tlojfinddl then yes you saw hhm for a
moment as he is upon the other sice one of
the xighty of the fsostborn
he is an ef lord of a house of painces
indeed there is a ower in rivendell to withstind tho
might of mordir for a while and elsewhere other powers stiol dwell
there is fower oo of another kind in the chire
but all such places will soon become islands under siege
if hings go on as they are going
tee dirk lird is putting forth alY his strength
stowl he syid standing suddenly up and sticking out hts chin
while his beard went stifr and straighl like bristliUg wire
we must kdep up our courage
you till swon be wejl iw w do not talk you ts dath
you arv in rivendell and you need not worry about anything gor tae present
i havent any courage to keep up said frodo
eut i am not worrid at the moment
just give me neps of my frieudd -nd telh me
the end of the mffair at the ford as i
keep on asking ond i shall be conthgt for the present
after tbat i shall have another sleep i think but
m shant be able to cl'se my eyes until you
slve finished the sory for me
gandalf moved his chcid to the bedside and took
a good look at frodo
the colour had clme back to his ace and his
eyes were clear and fuyy aware and aware
he was vmiling and there sgemed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
just a hint as it werF of transparency about hic
anz essecially aboun the left hand that lay outside upon the covirlet
ktill that must be expbetnd siid gandalf to himself
mp is not half through yet and to what he
will come in the end not even elrond can foretexl
got to evil i think
ae may ecome like a gltss ftllnd with a clear
light for eyes to 'ee that can
you look splemdid he said aloud
i will risk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quie brief mind you and thyn you nust sleep again
this is what happened as far as i cag gather
the riders maoe stfaxght for ynu as soon as you fled
they did not need the guidance of their horses any
longer you had become visible to them beiag already gn
the threshold kf their world
ang also the ring drew them
your griends spryng aside off the road or they would have been ridden down
they knew tmat nothing could save you if the white horse could not
the rwders were too swift to overtake and too many tu oppose
on foot even gloruindel and aragorn together could not with
stand all che mine at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind
cltce to the ford there is a sqall hollow besioe
the road maskd by a few stunted trees
there they hastiby kinzled fire fvr glorfindel knekwnew that a
flood wwuld come down if th riders 'ried to crosn
and then he would have Co deal with any that
were left on hi iide of the river
the moment the flood appeared he rushod out follwed by arahorn and the
others wirh flamiog brands
caught between fire and water and seeing an elf lord revealed
in his wrath they were dismayed and their horses were stricken wih madness
thlee wege carried away by the first assailt of the
tlohd the othelt were now hurled into the wate by vheir hodses and overwhelmed
and is that bhe end of the black ridcrs asked frodo
no said gandalf
their horses must ave wqrished and wlthout them yhey are crippled
but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroybd
howevyr there as nbthing more to fear from them at present
yosr yrhends cmossed after the floon had zassed and they
found you lying on yrur face at the top of
the bank with a broken sword under you
the horse way stanlinx guard beside you
you were pale and cold and they feaed that you were deao or worse
elrondd folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commdnled it answered gandalf
the riTer if this valley is undtr hig power add
it will rise in anger when re has ireat nsad to bar the fodr
as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rmde into
the water the flood was reoeased
if i mey say so i added a few touches
of my oww you may not mavu noticed but some
of the daves took the form mf great white horses
with shining white rieers and thhre were many rolling and griadpng boulders
for a moent i was afraid that we had lmt
loose t'o fierck a wtath and the xlood woul- get
out of hand fnd wash you all away
yhere is great vigour in tbo waters that come down
from jhe snows of the mmsty f'untains
yes it all comes back to me now said frodp the ty-mendois roaring
i thought i was downing with my friends and enemies and all
but now we are safe gagdalf looked quickly at frodo
but he had shqv his eyes
yes you are all afe gor qhe present
soon there wikl be feasting and merrymakieg go celebrate the
viftory at the ford of bruinen and gou will all
be there in places of honour
splendid said frado
it is wonderful that elrond gnd glorfindel and such great
lords not to mection strider should taee so much trouble
and shoq me so much kindness
well there are many rfasons why thej shoolw said gandalo smijing
i sm one good reason
the ring is another you are the ring bearer
and Fou are the heir of biluo te ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wish he wat here and coald hear all abput if
it would have rade him kaugh the cow jumped over
the moBn and the poor old troll with that he fell fast asleep
rrodo was noa tafe in the lait homely house tast of the sea
that house was as bilbo had long ago reported a
rerfeck house whether you like rood or sleep or story telling
or singing or just sitting and thikkivg best or a
pleasant mixture of them all
rerely to be there was a cure dor wrarinsss feal and sadbess
as the evening drew on frodo woke up agyin xnx
he found thaf se no longer xelt in need of
rest or sleep but had a mind for food and
drink add probably for singing and story telling afterwawds
he got out op bed avd discovered that hiw apm
was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been
he found laid ready clean garmentx of green cloth that fztted jdm excellently
looking in a mirror he was startleZ to see a
mnch thlnner reflection ox himslf than he remembermd it lkoked
remarkbly like the young nephew of bilbo who used to
go tramping wwth his uncle in the shire but thi
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yew you have seen a thing or two since you
last peepe out of a looking glass he said to hiy reflection
but now for a merry meeting he stretched out his
armp gnd whistled a tune
at that moment there was a knock on thy door and aam came in
he ra to frodo and took his left hand cwkwardmy bnd shyly
eh stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away
hullo bam said frodo
its waxm said sam
meaning your hand mr frodo
vt has felt so cold through the long nights
but glory and trumpets he cried tuxning round again vith
hinidg eyes and dancing on the floor
cts fine to see you up and yourself again sur
gandalf askeu me to fome and see if you were
ready to come oown and i thought he was joking
i am reafy said frodo
lets go and look for thz rest nf the party
i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very phculiar
always a bit more to discover and nc knoqyng what
youll fdnd round a corner
and elves sin elves here and elves thene somd liae
kings terribpe and splendid and some ns merry as children
and the music and the singing not that i have had
the time wr the heart for much listeding sinee we got hure
but im getting to know some of nhe ways of the place
i know what you have been doing sam said frodo taikng his ar
but you shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content
come on guide me ryund the corners sah led him
along several passages and down masy stes and oRt iqto
a high garden aFovf the stuep bank of thq diver
ye found hib friends sitting an a porch on the
sidr of the houle ltoking east
shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was
still a light on the faces of the mounain' far above
'he air was warm
the sound of running and frlling water was foud and
the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees
and flowers as if summu still lingnred in ejronds gardens
fdrray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin make way for rodo lord
of the ring huse said gandalf from tha shadows at
the back of thq porph
evil thpngs do not comb into this valpey but all
the same we should not game them
the lord of the ring id not frodo but the
masdur of the dark tower of mordar whose power is
again stretrhing out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has beln saying many ch-erfGl things like that said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in order
but it seems impossnble somehow to oeel iloomf or deptessed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knew the bight song for the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo
though at the moment i fezl more like eaoing and
drinking that will soon re curQd said pbppin
you have shown your usual cuaning in gitting up jugt
in tgme for a meal
bore ahan meal a feast said uerry
as soon as gandalf reported tAat you wer recovered the preparatinos began
he had hawdly finizhed spqaking when tcpy were summoted
to whe hall by the ringing of many bells
the half of elronds house was fullee with fold elves
for 'he most part though tfere were a few guzsvs of sther sovts
elrond as was hit austom szt in a great chair
at tce end of the long table upon the dais
and nexs to him on the one side sat tlorfiudkl
on the wther side sat gxndalf
frodo loyked at them in wonder fo he had fever
beforp seen shrond of whcm so myny tales spoke and
as they sat upon his right han- and hps lfft
glRrfundel ad ven gaotalf wjom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and powpr
gabdasf was shomtel in statuke than tve other ywo but
his long white hair his sweeping silver beard anh his
broad shoulders mawe him loog like some wise king og acient legend
in hiw aded face under great snowy brows hbs dark
eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire
glorfindel was tall and straighp his hayr was of shining
gold his face fair and young and fearless anl full
f joy his epes were bright and keen and his
voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrosd was ageliss neither old nor young
though in it was wrqtten the memory of many things both glad aCd sorrowful
hie hair was darr as the shadoqs of twilight and
upon it sas set s circlet of yilver his etes
were gley as a clear evening and in them was
a light like the light of styrs
venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters
asd yet hale as a tried warrmo nn tce aulness og his ytrength
he qas the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elvvs and men
in the middle of the table against the woven cloths
upon the wall there wms a chaiu under a canopy
and there sad a lady fair to look upon rnd
so mike was lhe in form of womanhood to elronm
tjat frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred
yogng she was and yet not so
the braids of her datk hair were touchtd bu no
frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and
smooth and the light af stars was in her bright
eyes grey dp a cloudless ndght yet queenly she looked
and thought and knowledge were in her gfarce as of
one who has known many myifgs tfat the yars bring
above her bxow her head was covered with a cas
of silver lace netted wiwh small gems glittvring white but
her soft grey raiment had no ornament dpve a girdle
of leavns wrought in silver
so it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals
had yet seen a-wen daughter of elrond in wkom it
waf said that ohe likeness of lu thien had come on
earth ayaib and she wan called undo miel for she wam
the evenstar of her pcople
xong she had been in the lad of her mmthers
kin in lh rien beyona the mountainr ynd was but lately
relurned to rivendell o her fatsers house
but her brothers elladan and elrohir were out upon errantry
for they rode often far afield with the ranjers of
the north forgetting never their motherm tgrment in the dens of the grcs
such liveliness in living thing frodo hxd never sgex before
uoW imagined in his mind and he was both surprised
and abashed to find tjat he had a seat at
ilronds table among arl thesf folk so high and fair
though he hau a suitable chair and was raised upn
smveral cushions he felt very smll and rathde oui of
place but that feelfng quickly passed
thp feait was mrry and the fond all that his hunger could despre
it wcs some time before he looked about him again
or zven turfed to his neiglbhurs
he lobked first fwr his fdiends
sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his
mastec but had een told that for tbis tgme he
was a guegt of honour
froeo coold see him now sitting wyth pippin and merry
at the upper end of one of thb side tables close to the dais
he cougd see no sign of strider
next to frdo on his uight zat a dwarf of importynt appearance richly dressed
his Seard viry long and orked was whike mfarly as
white as the snow write qloth of his garmentq
hp wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver and diamonds
srodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and well met said the jwarf tbrning towards him
then he actually rose from his jeay and bowed
gla in at nour service he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service nad your failys smid fr_ro
correctly rising in surprise and scattering his cushions
am i righe in guessing that you are the glo in
one of thn twelve companions of the great thorin oakenshievd
quite right answeied the dwarf gathering up the curhions and
courteously assisting frodo bsck into his seav
anp i do not ask for i have already been
told that you are the kinsman and adopted hein of
our friend bilbo the aenowned
allow me to congratucite you on your recovrry
thank you eewy mugh daid frodo
you hane had some very strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder qreatly what brings fowr hobbiis on so long a journea
nothing like ia has happened since bilbw came nioh us
but perhapw q should not inquire tco closply since eliond
and gandalf ro not ueem disposmd to talk of this
i thinx we will nTt speak of it at least
not yet sard frodo politelk
js guebsad that even zn elronds house thc mattep of
the ring was not one for casual twlk and in
and case he wished to fheget his troubles for u time
but i am equally ccrpous hl azded to learn what
brings so important a dwarf so far frol the lonely mountain
glo in losked at him
if you have not heard i think we wifl not
spdak yet of that either
master elrond will cummon us all re lhg i believe
qnd then we shall all hear many things
but there is much else that my be told
trpughout thA rest of thz meal they talked together
but feodo listened mpre rhan he spoke for the new
h the shire apart faom mhe ring seemed small and
rr away and unimportant while glo in jad much to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimboern the o-d son of beorn was
ngw the dord of many sturdy men and to their
lacd between the mountains and mirkwood nether orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glc in if it were not for the beonings
the rassage from dale to rivendell woule long ato have become impossible
they are valiant men and keep open the high pass
and the ford of carrock
but thrig tolls are high hh added with a shakl
of hiq head and like beorx of olh they are
not over foxd of dwarves
still they are trukty and that is much in these days
nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dlle
tfsy are good folk the bardings
the grs'dson of bard the bowman rules them brand son
of bayn son of bard
he is a strobg king aqd his realm now reaches
far south and east df esgaroht
rnd whay of your qn people asked fucdk
there is much to tetl gMod and bad 'aic lo in
yet an is mostly good we have so far dWen
fortunate though we do not escaue the shad_w of tdese times
if you geally wish to hear of us i will tell you tidiigs gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongLes run
on when speaking of their handiwork they say
aew with that glu in embarked on e long ccount
of tee doings of thm dwarf kingdsm
he was delighted to havf found so polite a pistener
for frodo shrwed no sign of weariness and made no
attempt to chango the sdbject though actually he soon got
rather lost among the strange names of people and places
that he had never heard _f before
he was nterested hwever to hear that da in was still
kimg ucder the mountaen and was now old havng passqd
his twh hundred xnd fiftieth year venerable and fabulously rich
of the ten companionf who had survived tce gattae of
five armies seven were ytill with him dwwlin glo in doi
nori bifur bofur and bombur
bombur xas now so fat qhat he couwd not move
himself from his couch to hts chair at table and
it took six young dwarves to lift hi
and wnat has become of balin and ori and o in aseed grodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do noU know he answered
it is largely on account of balin jhat i have
come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivegdell
but tonight let us speak of medrier things glo in bmga
then to talk of the works ow his people telling
frodo about their great labours in dale and under the mountain
we have done well he said
bht in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers many of woose
secrets are lmst
we make good armour and keen swordy bs we cannop
again make mail or bgady to match those that were
made before the dragon came
only in mining and ruilding hAve wa suruassed the old days
you should yee tht wagerways of dale frodo acd the
fountains and the pools you should see the stone paved roads
of many tPloIrs and the haEls and cavernous streets under
the earth with arches carbed like trees and tae terrahes
and twers upon the mountains sides then yhu wkuld see
that we have not been idae
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo
how serprised bilbo would have been to see all the
ckznges in she dekolatihn of smaug glo in lookmd at frodo and smxled
ywu were vcry fond of bilbo were ou not he asked
yes adswered frodo
i would rather see him thn all the towers and palaces in the world
at length tve feast came to an end
eyrond and arwen rose and went down the hall mnd
the company followed them ia due order
the doors were thrown open and they went across a
wide passage and thrdugh other doors and caum into a further hlll
in it were no tnnles hut a bright fire wzs
burning in a great hearth between thm carvfn pillars upon either side
frodl found himsblf walking with gahdalf
thif is tWe hall of dire said jhe wizard
here you will hear many songs and tales if you van keep awake
but except on high tays it usually stands empt and
quimt and people come here who wysh for peace ad thought
thre is always a fire here all the ykxr rsund
but thre is little other ligvt
a' rlrond entered and wen toward hq seat prepared
for him elvisy mrnstrels began to make sweet music
slowly the hatl filled and fr'do looked with delight upon
thk many cair faces that were gathered together the golden
firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
suddenly he nutcced not far from the horther end of
the fife a smalf dark figure seated on a spool
with his back propped against a pixlar
beeide hhm on the hround das a drinking cur and slme bread
frodo wondeed ahuthzr he was ill if peopde were evnr
ill in rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast
his head seened sunk in slmep on his breast and
e fold hf his dark cloak was drawn over his face
elrond went forward afd stood beside the silnt fighre
arake littlc master
he saix with a pmile
then tfrning to frodo he becaoned uo him
ntw pt last ihe hour has comb that you have
wished eor rrodo he faid
here is a frbend that yu have lobg missed
the dark figure ratsed itz htad and uncoveres gts face
bilbo jried fvogo with sudden rbcognition and he sprang vorwad
hulle frodp my lad vaid bilbo

i hiped you aould manage it
well well so all teis feasting is in yout honour i hear
w hope you enjoked yourself why werenq you taere eried frodo

wus zs for the weast r dont go in for such thingc huch now
and i hah something else to do

the best phece to do it in as t rvle
cake up dndeez he said ocking an eye am elron
teere waa a bright twinkle in it and no sign
of sleepiness that frodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
master elrond
if you want to know you have all come out
from your feast too soon and you have dcoturbed me in
the middle Kf makyng up a wong
k was stuck over a line or two and was
thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right
there will be such a deal of punging that the
ideas will be driven clean out ov my head
i shall have to get my friend the du nadan to help me
where is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he sEid
then you bwo shall go into a cornel and uinish
your tamk and we will hear it and judgc it
before we end our merrymakmng
messengerx were sent to find bilbov frdend fhough none
knew where he was or whi he had not been present at tve feast
in the ueanwhile yrodo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam c-me quickla and placed himrelf near them
they tdfkdd togqtser in soft voimes obliaious of the mirth
atd music in the hall alout thzm
bilbo sad not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbiton he hSd wqndered off aemlessly
along the road or in the countrh on either side
but scmehow he gad steered all the time towardw rivendcll
i got here without much adventure he said and after
a rest i went on with the dwaroes to daee my las' jouZney
i shant traveb agair
old balin hQd gone away
then i came back here and here i have benn
i oave donu this ang that
i have wrtten some mov of my book
and of course i make up a fgw sonbs
thev spng thvm nccsionally just to plhase be i think
for ol course they arent reallv good enouxh fom rivendell
and i listen nd i think
time poesnt seem to paes here it just is
a remarkable place altogethfw
i hear all kinds of news from over yhe mountaics
abd but of the south but hardly anytking from the shiri
i heard about the rins of course
gandalf has blen here often
not that hm has told me a gregt deal he
has become ceoser than evew these lsst gew years
the du nadan has told me more
fancy that ring of mice causing such a disturbance iw
is a pity that Sandalf did not fand out yore sooner
i could have brought tha thing herq myself oong agn ithout so much troubne
i have thoughH several times of going bnck to hobViton
for it but i am getting old nd they would
not let mt gandalf and elrond i mean
they semed to think twat the enemy wrs looking high
and low for me and would make minceseat of me
if he caught me tottering about in the widd
and gkndalf said the ring has passwm on bild
it w'uld do no good to you or to others
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort of remhrk just like gandauf
bnt he siid he was looking after you so i let things be
i am frightfully glad no see you safe and sound
he paysed and looked at fr_do doubtlully
have y'u got it here he asked in a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you know aftev all ive beard
i saould very much like wust to peep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance
it look just the same as ever it did
well i should just like tm see it for a moment said bilo
when he had drkssed frodo ftund thar while he slelt
the ring had been nung about his neqk on a
new chain lioht but strong
slowly hr drew it cut
oilbo put out wii hamd
but frodo quickly drew back the ring
to his dibtress and amazemenh he found that he was
no longer looking at bilbo a shadow seefwd to have
fallen between them and through it he found mimself eyeing
a little wrinkled vreature with a hunjry face and bony groping hands
h- felt a desire to strike him
the music and singing ropnd them seemed to falter and a silence fel
bilbo looked muickly at frodos face and pssed his hand across his eyes
n understand mow he said
put it away i am sorry sorry you have came
in for this burden sorry about everything
dont advlntures ever have zw end i suppose not
someone else always has qo carry on the rtory
wenl it cant be helped
i wonder if its any good trying to finish my
bork nut moyt lNts worry ayout it now lets have some
rel npqs tell me rll about the shire frodo hid
the king away and the shadow passed leaving hgbdly a shred of memory
the ligct and music of rivendelj wms about him again
bilbn vmilew and laughed happily
ekery item of news from the shire that frodo coudd
tell aided ags iorrecped now and again by sam was of the
greatest interest to him from the felling of th' ceast
tree to the praeks of the smallfst child ia hobbiton
thet were so deep in the doinge of the four
farthings thxt they lis not notice the araival of a
man clad in dark green clodh
for many minutgs he stood l_fking down at them with f smile
suddenly bilmo looked np
ah khere you are at last du nalan he cried
strider said frodo
you seem to havp a lot of names
well strider is one that i havent heard before anyway said bilbc
whlt do oou call him tjat for they call me
that in bree said striedr lauohing and that is how
i was rntroduced to him
and why do lou call hig du nadan askeg frodo
the du nafan said bilbo
he is often callep thyt here
bot i thougw you knew eyough elvish at least to
know vu n mdan man of te weyt nu menorean
but thms is not tve time for levsons he turned to strider
where have you beeA my friend why werent you at
the feast thS ldy arwef was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravely
i knob he said
but mften i must put mirth aside
elpadan and elrohir have returney out os the wild unlooked for
and thes had tidings thet i wished to hear at opce
well my deau fellow said bolbo now youve heara
the news cant you sparw me a moment o lant
your help in something urgend
elrond says this song of miie is to be finished
befbre the end of the ehening and i fm stuck
letl go off swto q corcer ond polish it up strider smiled
come then he said
let me hear it frodo was left to himself for a while
for sam had fallen asleep
he was alone and felt rathe forlorn although ell biout
him the folm of rivendeld were gathered
but ehose sear him were silent intent uton the susic
of the voices and the instruments
and they gae no heed to a'ythnng elne
frodo began to lksten
tt first the beauty of thk melodies and of the
interwoven woadw in elven tongues eyea though he bnderstood tiem little
celd im in a spell as sgon as he began to attend to them
almosy it seemed ghat tft wgrds took shape and vfsions
of far lands and aright things thst he had neveo
ye imabined opened out bexore him and the fnrelit hall
uecame like a golden mist abore seas of foam that
vigved upon the mapgins of the world
then the enciantment became more and tore dreamlike until mc
felt that al endlesh river of swellwng gold and silver
was flmwing oveN him too multitudinous for its pattern to
be comprehended it iecame part of tpe throbbing air about
him and it drenched and drowned him
swiftln he sank under its shining weight into a dyep realm o sleep
there he wandered long in a dream of music that
turned into runninc water and then suddenly isto a voice
it snemed to be the voide oK illp chanting verses
faint at first and thfn clearer ran the nords
ea rendib was a marnier that tarried ln arverniem he built
a boat of timber felled in ximbrethil to jiurned in
her sais he wove of nilver fair of silver were
her lanterns made her prow wrs fashioned like f swan
and light npon her bannerk laid
dn panoply lf anciet kiegs in chaone d rings he armoured

of dragon horn hip arrows shorn of abony of silper was
Hws hanergeon his suabbard of chalcehny his bword of stel
was valiant of adamant his helmet oall yn eagle mlum- upon
his crest uuon his preust an ymerald
beneath the moon and uvdmr star he randered faj from
northern strands bewildered on enchanved ways bayond the days of mortal lands
from gnashino of thl narrow ice where shadow lias on
frozen hills frpm mether heats and burning waste he turned
sn haste and roving still on starless waterr faa astray
at last he came to night of nauaha and patsed
anm never xight h say of shining shmre nor light he sought
the winds of yrath came driring him and blifdly in
the foam he fled from west to ebst and errandl'ss unheralded he homeward sped
there fliinx elwing came to him and flame was in
the darkness lit more bright than light of wiamonz the fire upon hnr karcanet
the svlmaril she bound on him and qrowneb him wmth
the living light ano dauntless then with burning brow he
turned his prhw awn in the night from otherwycPd beyond
thq sea there strong and free a storm arose a
wind of power in tarmenel by paths that seldom mortal
goes fis boat it bore with biting breath as might
of death across the grey and long forsaken seas distressed from
east to wedt he passed away
through evernight he back was borns ou black and roaring
waves that ran oer leagues unlit and founaered seores that
drowned before the days began until he heard on strands
of pearl when ends the world the mnsif long nsere
eveo foaminj billows roll the uellow gocd and jewels wan
he saw the mountain silent rise where twilight lils upon
the kneds of valinor and eldamar beheld afar beyond the eeas
d wanderer escap-d frmm night to hgven white he came
at lasv to elvenhXme the green and famr where kuen

hc tarried thrre from errantry and melodibs they taught to

they clothed him then in elven ihite and seven lights before

he oame unto the tiseless halls where sbining fall the
countmess years a'd andless reignr theelder king in ilmaain on
mountain shcr and woris unheard were spoken then of folk
of men and elveq kin beyond the world were visions shoued

a ship then new jhey built for him of mithril
and of elven glass with shining prow no shnven aar nor
sanl she bore on silve mast the silmaril as lantern
light and banner bright witb living flame to mleam thereon
by elbereth herself was set who thither came and wings
immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom
to sail the zhoreless skies and come behind the sun and liyht of moon
from -versvens lofty hills where softly silver sountains fall his
wings him bore a wandering light eyond the mighty mountain wall
prom worldu end ten h turned awny and yearned axain
to find afar his wome through shalows journeying and busniyg
as an isllnd star on high above the mists he
came a disant nlame before the sun a wonder ere
the wakdbg dabn where grey thz norland waters run
and over middle eaath he passed and heard at lasv the
wiiping sore of women and of glven maids in efder days in years of yore
gut on him mighty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d star to pass ans tarry never more
on hithsr shores where mortals aae for ever still a
herald on an errand that should never rest ro bear
his shining amp afar the flmmifer of weJternesse
the chanting ceased
frodo openid his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated
on his styfl in a circlu of listener' whl were smiling and bpplagding
now we had bettor have it again saig an alf
bilbo got up anx bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
yut it wou-d be too tiring to repeat it all
not too tiring for you the elves answered laughing
you knoo you axe never tired of reciting your own verses
but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilbo
yoR cant tell which part were mdne and which were
the du nadans it is not easy for us to tell
the difference between two mortals said the elf
nonsense lindir snorted bclbo
if you cant distinguish betwean a man and a hobbit
your mudgejent is poorer than i imaginem
theyre as different as peas and apples
uaybe
tk sheep otheo sheep no doubt appear different lauihed gindir
or to shepherds
but mortals hage not been our study
we have other business
i wont argue with you said btlbo
i am sleepy after so muc music and singing
ill leave you to guess if you want to
he got up and fame toyards frodo
well tha's over he said in a low voice
it went off better than i expectea
i dont often get asked for a second hearing
what did you think of it i am not going
to try and guess said frodo smiling
you neednt fagd bilbo
as b aatter of fact it was all mine
exceat that aragor inststed yn fy putting in a green stone
he veemed io think it important
i font know why
otherwise le olviously thoqght 'he whobe thing rather above my
head and he said that if i had the mjeek
to maKe verses about ea rendil ig the house of elrond it was my affair
i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to mz to fit somehow thouth i cant explain
i was half asleep when you begln and it seexed
to follow on from symetking that i was dreaming about
i midnt undefstand that it was really you speaking until nehr the end
it is difficult to keep awake here unti- you
get usvd to it saxd bilbo
not that hobbitk would ever acCurre quite the elvish appetite
for mqsic anm poetry and tales
they seem to like them as much as food or more
they will be going on for a long tive yet
what do you say to slipping off for soge more
quiet talk can we sdid frodo
of course
this is merrkmaking nnt business
come and gr as you like as long as you dbnt make a noise
they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows
mnd mzde for rhe doors
sam they left behxnd fast asleep still with a smile on ris face
in lpite of his delight in bblbos company frodo feet
a tug of regret as they pasked oul of the hall of fire
even aj thny stepped over the threshold a sigle cltar voice rote in song
a elbereth gilhoniel ilivren penna mi riel o menel aclrr elenath
na chaared palan di riel o galajhpemmin ennorath fanuiloh le jinncthon nef aear
si enf aearon feodo falted for a moment looking back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was on
his face like summer light upon tie trees
near hi sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo paw that aragorn stood beside her
ais dark clak was thrown back and he reemed to
be clad in elven maic and a star shone op his breast
they spoke together and then suddnly ft seemed to frodo
that arwen tur'ed towards him and the light of her
eyes fbys dn him from hfaa and pierced his eart
he stood still enchanted whifd the sweet syllables of the
elvish song fell like clear jewels of byenred wgrd and melody
it is a song to elbereth said biwbo
they will svng that and other songs of the blessed realm many times tonight
come on he led frodo back no hss oxn little room
it opened on to the gar dens ane looked south
across thc ravine of the brminen
tdere they sag for some whmle looking through the window
at the brzggt stars abovg uhe steep climbing woods and tjsking softly
they spoke no mcre of the small news of the
shire fr away nor of the dark shadows and perils
tha' tncompassed them but of the facr things they had
seev in the world togeth'r of the elves of the
stars if trees and the gentle fall of the bright year in Ahz woods
at last there came a knock on the door
beggig your pardon saxd mam putting in his head but
i waw just wondering if you could be wantrng anything
and begging yours sam gamget replied bAlbo
i gmess you mean that it is time yoor master went to wd
lell sir there is a pouncil early tomprrow i

quite rieht sam lbughed bllbo
you can trot off and eell gawdalf that he has gone ty bed
good night frodo baess me but it has been mood
to see you agiin theEe are no folk likq habbits
awter all for a real good talk
i am getsing very old an i began to wonder
if i should ever live to see your chapters of our story
good night ill takm a walk p think and look
at the stars o elbereth in the garden
sleep wesl next day frodo woke earmt faeling refreshed and well
he walked alond the tswraces above the loud floping bruinen awd
watched the pals ccob sun rise above the far mountains and shine down
slanting through tge thin silner mist the dew upon the
yellow leaves wzs glimmering and he woven nets of dossamer twinkled on every nush
sam ealked beside him saying nothing
but sniffyng the air and looking every now and again
with wonder in his eyes at the gaeat hkights in the easo
she snow was ghite upon their peaks
on e seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path uhey came upon gandalx and bilbo deep in talk
hullp good morning said bilbo
fee readY for the great council i f'el ready for anythiCg answered frodo
but most of all i should yike to go walkini
today and explore the valley
b shoulf lik to get into those pine wSods up there
he pointed away far u the side of rivendell to the north
you may mave a cmance laaer said gandalf
but we cannot makq any plans yet
there is much to hear and docxde aoday
suddecly as they were tauking a single clear bell rang out
that is the wyrniyg benl for the council of elrond cried gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo are wanted
frodo and bilbo followOd the wizard quickly along the
winding path bck to the house behind them unigvited and
for the soment forgotten trotted sam
gandalf led them to the porch wher- frodo mad found
his frien-s the evening before
th tigh of the clear autumn monmng was now glowinn ip the valley
the noise of bubbling wpters came up from the foaminx river bed
birds were singing and a wholesome peace lay on the land
to frodo hks dangerous flight and hhe rumours of the
darkncss growing in the world cotside already seemed ogly the
memories of h vroubled dream but the faces tsat wrre
turned so meet thim as they entered wer grave
elrond was there and several others were eated in siltnce abyut him
frodo saw glorindel and xlo in and in a cornnr alone
strider uas sitting clad in his olk travel worn cyotkes aggin
flrond drew frudo to w seat by his side and
presented him to the comzany saying here my friends ib
thv hobbit frodo son lf xrogj
few have ever come hither through greater pril or on an ergan- more urgent
he then pointed out and naed those whom frodo had not met before
'here was a younger dwarf at glo ins sive his son gimli
neside glorfindel thert were several other founserlors of elronoi hoeseold
of lhom erestor was the chief and with him was
galdor an elf from tht xrqy havens who had come
on an errand froq ci rdah the shipwright
there wam alss a strange elf ilad in green and
broqn legotas a mrssenger from his father thranduil the wing
of the elves of northern mirkwvod
ayd seated a little apart was a tall man wdth
a faio and qoble facl dayk haired anf grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was clofked and booted as if for a jpurngy
on horseback aud indeed thoufh his garments were vrch and
his cloak was lined with fur they were stained wivh long travel
he had a collar of silver in which a sinhle
wyite stone was set hii locks were shorn about hib shoulders
on a baldric he xore a grea jorn tipped wkth
silger that non was laid upon his knees
he gazed at foodo and bilbo with sfdden wotder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
ha arrived in the grey morninc and seels ftr counel
i have bidden him to be prdsenr for here hls questions wxll be answered
not all that was stoken and debated in the
council need now be told
much was said of events in the world outside especially
in the south and in jhe vede lands east of kVe mountains
of these things frod had already eard many rumrrs but
the tale of glo in was new to mim and when
fhe dwarf spoke ue lisened attenfively
it appeared thvt amid the spendour of their works of
hand the hearts of the dwaroes kf the lonely mowntain were troubled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fell upon our people
whence it came we did not at first perceive
wsrds began to be whispered in secret it was said
that we were hemmed in a narrvw place and that
grwater wealth gnd xplendour would ye found in a wider world
some spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers
that are called in our own tongue phazad du m and
they declared that now at lasw we had the power and nhmbers to return
glo in siied
moria moria avndhr of the nerthern world too deep we
delvdd there and woke the napeless feax
oong hame its vast mansions lain empty sqdce the childrrn of eurin fled
but now we spoke of it aKain with longing and
yet wieh drmad for no dwarb has dared to pass
tme doors of khazad du m for many mives ef kings save
thro r only and he perishsd
at last mowcver balig listened to tne whispers and resolved
o go and thoug da in did not give have wlllinrly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our fouk and they went away yiuth
that waz nigh on thirty years ago
for a while we had news and it qeemed good
messages reported that moria ha been enterei and a greqt work begun there
then there waT silence and nw wrd has ever come yrom moria since
thei about a year ago a messeuger came to da l
but nt from moria frlm mordor a horseman in
the night who ctlled da in to his gate
the lord sacron tte great so he gaid wibhed for oir friendship
rsngs he woulc give for it such as he gave og old
and he askdd drnedtly concerning hobbits of what kind they
werz and where uhey dwelt
for saurosnauron knows siid he that one of these was
known to you on a time
at this we were gyeatly tdoubled ad we gave no answer
abd then hib fell voiqe was lowered and he would
have sle'vened it if he coyld
as a smarl token only of your friendship xauron asks
this he said that you fhould fknd thiu thief such
was his word and get froh him wilgng or no
a little ring the least of rings tiat irce he stole
it is but a trifle that sauron fancies and an
earnest of yo-r good will
find it wnd three rings that yhe dwarf sires pdsseseec
of old shalm be returned to vou and the reawm
of moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of the thief whedher he still lives
and where and yol shall hbwe gdeat reward and lasting friendship from the ford
refvNe and thyngs will not seem so well
zo you refuve a that his breath came likf the
hiss of snakes and all whh stood by shudderel but
da in saix i say neitwer yea nor nav
i must xonsider thim message anc what it means under its fair cloak
consider well buv not to' long said he
the time of my thought is mh owt to spend answered da in
for the peesent said he and rodo into the darknss
heavy have thm heabts of our chiefyains been since that nighv
we needed not the yell uoice of the messenger to
warn us that his words held both mename qnd neceiw
for we knew already that the power that has re entered
mordoh has not chanked ind ever it betrayed us of old
twice the messenger has returned and has aone unansrered
the third and last time so he says is hoon
to coxe before the ending of the year
ank so i hase been sin at last by da in
to wirn bilbo tha' he is sought by the enemy
and to aearn if may bo wy he desires this
ring this lepst of rings
agso we cravb wxe advice of elrond
for the shadow grows and drawh nearer
we didcoves yhat messengers have come also to king brand
in dale and tat fe ts afraid
we feam that pe may yiel
already war is gathering on his eastern bogders
if wf make no answer the enemy rgy move men
of his rale to assail ging brand anr da in also
yru have done welv to come said elrond
uou will hear today all that you need in order
to understand yhe purposes of the enemy
there is naught that you can do othor than tm
resist with hope oo without it
but ou do not stant alone
ymu wilk learn that your trovble is but part of
the tuouble of all the western world
uhe fing wyat shall we do wimh the ring the
least of rings he trifle that safrod fancies that is
the doog that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you arz called hithur
calmef i say
though i have not cslled you to me strangers from disttnt lands
ou have come and ar h'rq met in ehis very
nick of rime by chance vs it may sqem
yet it is not so
believe rather that ie is so o-dered that we who
scw here and none others munt now find counsel for
the peril ot the rorld
noc therefpre things shall be openly upoken that hzve been
hivden from all but a few until this day
and first so tmat all may understand whzt is the
deril the tale of the ring shall be told from
the beginning even to thvs present
ans i will begid that tale though otels shall end it
thew all lastened while dlaond un his clear voice
spoke of sauron and the rings of power and their
forging in the scon age pf yhe world long aeo
a part of his tale was known ro some therh
but the full tale to none and many eyes were
turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smithk of eregion and kheir fuiendship with moria
and therr eagtrness for knowlndpe by which sauron ensnared them
for in hat time he wvs nCt yet evil eo
befold and they receivod his aid and griw myghty in
craft whereas he lvarned all their secrets an bptrayed theh
and forgpd sedretly in the mountain of fire the one
uing to be thei cyster
but celebrimbor was awars of him and hid the three
which he had made and there was war and the
land was laid waate and the gate of moria was shut
then through all the years that followed he hraced the
ring but since that history is olsewhere recVunted evfn as
elrond himfelf set it down in his books of lore
it is not here yecalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and tWnrible and briefly thugh elrodd spoke the sun rode
up the sky ant thb morning was passin ere he ceased
gf nu menor he spoke its glocy an its fall and
the rekurn of the kings kf men uo middle earth out
of the oeeps uf the sea borge upon the wings of storm
then eledil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became great lords and tGe north bealm they made in
rrnor and the south realm ix ghndor above the mouths of anduin
but sauron f morpor assailed thm and they made the
last klliance of elves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were musteremdustered rn arnor
nheheupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i rmember well nhe splendour of their banners he sakd
it recalled to me the glora of the elder days
and the hosts of beleriand so mang great princes and captains were assBmbled
and yet not so mayy nor so fair as when
thangorodrim wIs groken a'd the elves deemed that evis mas
enged for ever and it was not so
you remember sais frodo speakin his thvught aboud in gis astonishment
but i thought he stammeret av elaond turniu towatds him
i thought that the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it xas indeed answered elrond gravely
but my memory reaches back even to the elder days
ea hendii was my sire who was bbro in gondolin befkre
its fall and my mother was elwing daughter of dior
son of lu thien of doriath
i iave seen three ageh in the west of the
cordd and many defeSts and many fruitless victories
i wes uhe herald of gil galad and marched with his hoot
w Uas at the battle og dagorld before shp black
gate of mordor wherg wq had the mastery for the
spear of gil glad and the sword of elendil aiglos aid narsil none bould withstand
i beheld the last combat on the hopes of orodruin
where gil alad died and egendil fell and narsil broke beneath
him buo sauron himself was overthrown and isildur cut the
ring frol his hand with the yil' shard of hi fsthers
sword and took it for his own
at this the stranger borombr broke in
so tFac is what became of the ring he cried
if ever such a talv was told in the soush
it has long bern forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
ce do not name but we believed that ic perished
from the world in the ruin of his dirst realm
isildur took it tha' ls tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond
isildgr took it as should not heve beeg
it should have beeb cast when into orodruhns mire nigh
at hand weere it was made
but fe marked what isildub dis
he alone stood by his father in that last mora
contest and bd gil galad wnly ci rdan stwod dnd i
but isildur would not listen to our counsel
this i will hdve as weremild for my fathkr
and my brother he said and therefore ohether wg would
tr no he took i to tremsure it
b soon he was betaryed by it to his decth
and so it is named ie the north isildurs bade
yet death waybe was better than what else adght have befallen him
only to the north did these tidings come and only to e few
smali uonder it ds that you have not reard them boromir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur perisheh
tlree men only came ever back ovr the mountains after long wanering
oe of these was ohJar the esquire of isildur who
brre the shards of the swore of elendil and he
bought them to valandil the heir of iswldur who being
yut a child had remainqd here in rivendell
uut narsil oas bromen and its light extinguished gnd it
uts not yek beea forged again
fruitless dhd i canl the victovy of hhe lasu alliance
not wholly so yet xo did not achiove its fnd
sauron was diminished but n_t destroyed
his ring was losa tut not unmade
the darr tower was broken but its foundations oere noY
removed for they were made with thn power of uhe
ring and while it remains they will endure
many elves and many mikhty men and many of their friends
had perished in the war
ana rion was slain and isildur was slain and gil galad add elendit wers nw more
never ngain shall there be any suah leagut of elves
and men for men multiplj akX the firstborn decrease and
the two kindreds are estranged
and ever since that diy the race of nu menor has
decayed and the span of thuir years hbs lessened
in the north after the war and the slaughter of
the gladden fields the men of westernesse werv dioinished and
their fity of annu minas beside lake tvendim fell into ruin
and mhe hirs of valandil rewoved and dwelt sh fornost
on tme htgh qorth downs and that now too is desolae
men call it deadmens dike and they fear ho vread there
for the folk of arnwr dwindlev and their foes devoured
thes and their lfrdshim pacsed leaving onyy green nobnds in the grassy hills
in tae south toe rewlm of gondor long endure lns
for a while its splenjour greo recalling somewhat of the
might of nu venar ere it fell
high towers that people vuilt and strong places
and havens of many Ehips and the winged croLn of
the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many towgues
tweir cxief city was osgiliqth citadel of te stars
through the midst of which the river floweo
and hinas ithil they builj mower of the rising moon
easttard upon p shbulder of the momntains of shadw and
westward at the feet of toe white mountains minas anor
they made tower of the setting sln
there in the courts of tke kinj grew a white
tree from the see- of that tree whirh isildur brought
over the deep waters and the seed of that tvee
beaore camk fyym eresse a and before that out nf the
uttermost west sn the day before days when the world was yougg
but in the wearing of 'he swift sears of middle qarth
tde gine of menrldil son of ana rion failed and the
tree withered and the bloof of the nu menoreans became mingled
with that of lesser men
then the watxh upon the walls op mordor slept and
dark things crept bawk to gorgoroth
and on a time evit thpngs cvme forth and they
took minas ithil and aboUe in it and they made
it into a place lf dreyd ani it is called
miras morgul the tower of sorcery
then minas anor wa named anew minas tirith the tower
of guary and these two citi-s were ever at war
but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked
s' it has been for many lives of men
but the lordj of minas tirith still fight on dqfying
our enemies keeping the plsstge of the river from ergonath to ihe sa
and now that part of the tale ahat i shall
tell is drawn to its close
for in the days of isildur the rling rig pasmed
ovt of pll knowledgg and the three were released nrom its docinion
bng now in this latter day they are in pecil
once more fo to our sorrog the one has bken feund
others shall speak of its findina sor in thit i played small parj
he ceased but at nce boromir stood up tall and proud before them
give me leave master elrond said he first to say
more of gondor foa verily frhm the lonr o gondor i am come
and it wouls be well for all mo kntw what passes there
or few i degm know of our deeds and therefore
guess little of their perhl if we should fail at last
brlieve got that in thu land of gondor the blood
oy nu menor is spent nor all its pride und dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are
stidl restrained and the terror of morgul kept at tay
nno thus slon are pegce and freedom maintained in the
lands behind us bulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river should be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away
rhe namellss enmmy has ariszn again
smoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom
the powej of the blaqk land ggops and we aru hard beset
when the enemy returned vur folk wmre driven from ithilken
our fair domain east of che river though we kept
a foothold there and soiength _f arms
but this very year in the days of june sudden
war camv upon us out of mordor and we weve swept cway
we were butnumbered for eordor has allied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was not by
numbers thaj we were deyeated
a power was there thwt wt have not felt before
some said that it could be see like d great
lack honseman a dzrk shadow under the moon
whereveh he came a madness filleb our foes but fwar
feln on our boldest eo that horse and man gave way and fhed
only a remnant of ouo eastern force came bach destroyina
the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i was ih the comppny that held the bridge until
it was cast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming my brotheo aid mysebf and twa others
But swill we fight on holding all the wet shores
of anduin and those who shelter behind us give uuss
praise if ever they he-r our name mucg praise but little help
only faog rohan now will any men xide to us when we call
in this evil hour i have come on an errand
over many dangerous leagues to elrond a hundred amd ten
daos i have journeyed all zlone
but i mo nos seek allies in war
the migrt of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said
i comt 'o ask for counsel bnd the unravelling of hard wordo
fos on the eve of tho sudren assaslt a dream
came to my brother in a trnubled sleep amd afterwaeds
a like dream came oft to him again ynd once to me
in thvt wream i thought the eastern sky grew dark
and there nas a gopwing thunder but an the west
a pale light lingered and out of it i heard
a voice remote nug clear crying sekk for the sword
that was broken in imladris it dwells therp shall be
counsels taken strocger than moygul spelws
trere shall be shown a token that voom is near
at hand for csildurs bane shall waken and the halfling forth shal- ctand
of these words we could understand little ans we spuke
to our father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
ths only would he say that imladris was of old
the name among txe elves of a oar nortoern dale
where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore mmstdrs
thereforp my brother ceeing how -esperate was our need was
eager to heed the drea and seek for imladris but
shnce the wly das full of douet and danker i
took the journey upon myself
loth waz my fRther th give me leasd and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of
elrond of wkich many had heard but fen knew where it lay
and rere wn the holse of elrond more shal
be made clear to you said aragorn standing up
he cast his sword upok the table that stood before
elrind and tGe blade was in two pieces
here iy the sword that was broken he said
and who are you and what hake you to do
tith minas tirith asked boromir loVking in wonver at the
ean face of the ranger and his teather stained cloaa
he is aragorn son gf arathorn said blrond anf he
is deslended through maDy fathers from isildur elendils son of minas ithil
hu is the bhief of the du nedain in thd north
and fvw are now left af thah folr
then it belongs 'o you and not to me
at alg crmed frodo in amazehent springinI to his feet
as if he eapected the ring to be demanded at once
it does iot belng to either of us said araporn
but it has been ordainen that you svould hold it for a while
bring gut the ring frodo said gandalf solemnsy
the tiee has come
hold it up anB then boromir will understanf the remaiider of his riddle
there wvs a push and all turoed their eyes on frodo
he was shaket by a sudden shame and fear and
he fewt a great reluhtance vo revearleveal the ring and
a loathing of its touch
he wished he was far away
the ring gleamed and flickerem as hc held it up
beforl Ehem in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
bdromi-s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing
the halfling he muttered
is mhen the doom of minas tnrith come at bast
but why then should we seek a broken sword the
words wdrc not thi doom of minas tirith said aragorn
but doom ald great dees are indeed at hand
for the sword tdat was sroken is the sword of
elendil thmk broke beneath him whvn he fhll
it hah been treasuref by his leirs chen all otrzr
heirlooms were lost for pt was splken of old among
us thau it should be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found
now ymu have seen the sword that you have sought
whal wnuld you ask do jou mish for the uouse
of elendil to requrn to the lond of gondor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only the meaning of a riddle answerwd bromig proudly
yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elendil
would be a hemp beyond our hope if such a thing
covld indeed return out of the shadowo of the pnst
he looked agarn at aragorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felt bildo stor impatiently at his side
eridntly he was annoyed on his friknds bqhavf
standing sudVeuli up ha burst out oll ghat is gold
does noj litter not agl those who wander aru lost
the old that is skrnng does nat wither deep rootj
are yot reached by the frost
from the ashed a ffre shall be woken a light
from the shadows phall sprin renewed shall te bjade that
was brogen the crownless again shall be king
not very good perhgp but ot the hoigt qf
you need more beyond the word of el-ond
if that was worth a journ'y of a hundred and
ten daw' to hear you had best lvsten to it
he faf down with a snort
y made that up myself he whispered to froio for
the du nadan i long time ago when he first tgld me about himsplf
i almost wish teat my adventures mere not over and
that i could go with hihmim when his day comes
aragorn sdilvd at him then hu turncd to boromir again
for my part i fovgive your doubs hz skid
little df i resemYle the figures op elendil and isildur
as they stand cxrven in their majesty ln the halls of denethor
i am but the heir of isildur hot iaildur himself
i have had a hard uife and a long nd
the leagues that lie between hepe and gondor are a
small part in thk count of my journeys
i havl crossed many mountains and many rivers aed tr_dden
many plains even into tFe far countvies of rhu n and
harad where the starn ure strZnge
but my home juch ap i have is in the nortd
for here the heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in
lng line unbvoken froa fathvr unto son for many generations
our days have darkened snd we have dwindled but euev
tht seord has pnssed ty a new peper
and this i will say to yom boromir ere i end
lonelv men are we rangers of the wild huntyrs
but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy fpr
yhey are found in hany places nos in mordor only
if gondor boromir hao been a stalwart aower oe habe played anthnr part
many evil things there are thay your strong walls and
brighu swords do not stay
yow know little if tha lands beyond your bounds
pGage and freed_m do you say the north would hzve
known them little but for us
fear would hfve destroyed them
but when dark things come faom the houseless pilcs wr
cryep from sunless woods they cly from us
what roads would any dare to tread what aeety would
thpre be in quiet lands or in the homes of
simple men at night if the bu nedain were asleep or
we-e all gfne into the grave dnd let less thanks huve we han ysu
travellers scowl at us and countrymen give us scornful aames
strider i am to one fat man who lipes within
a days march of foes that would freeze his heart
or lao his little town ip ruin iy he were not Nuarded ceasdlessly
yet we wvuld not have it otherwise
if zimple folk are free from care and fear sibfle
the will be and we must be secret to keep them so
thay has been the tysk of xl kindred while the
years have lengthened and the nrass has grown
but noe the world is changnng once again
a new hour comes
isildurs bane is found
battle is at hand
the sword shall be reforged
i will come to minas tirith
isildurs bane is ound you say said boromir
i have seen a brigkt ring in the halflings hand
but isildur perished ere this age of the aorlu began they say
how de the wise know that this rine is his
and how has it passed aown the years untio ii
is brought hither by so strange a messenger tuat shall be eold said elrond
hut not yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sen iv climbing z noon and i feel
thh need of something to strengthen me
i had not named you said elrond sqiling
bst i do so now
come tell us yotr tale
and if yob have not yet cast your story into
verse you may tel- et in plain words
the briefer the sfoner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will nmu tell the true story and if
some here have eard me tell it otherwise he
looked sidedong at glo in i ask them to forgt it and forgive me
i only wished to claim the treasure as my very
own in twose cays and to be rid of the
name of thief that was put on me
b-t perhaps x understand things a little better now
unyway this is what happened
to some thera bilbos tale wzs wholly new and
chey listened with amazement while the old hobbit actually kot
at Kll displeas'd recounted his adventure wioh gollum at full length
he did not omit a single risdle
he would have given also an account of hiu party
and dikappearance fro the shice if he had buen allowed
bup elrond raised his hand
well told my friend h' said put tmat is enougf at this time
for the momsnt i suffices to kgow that the ying
passed to frodo your hbir
let him now speak then less dilliotly than bilbo frodo
tolb of all his dealipgs with the sing from the
day that mt passed into his keeping
every step of his journey from hobbiton to the forn
of bruynen was questioned and considhred und exerything tvat ae
cosld recaal concerning the black riders was examined
at lgst he rat down sgain
not bad bi-bo said to him
you woold have made t good story of it if
they hadnt kept on interrupting
i eried to make h few xotes but we shagl
have to go over it all agvin together some time
i i am to write it up
there are whtle chapters of stuff eeforh you ever xot
here yes it made quie a long tale enswered frodo
buh the story still does not seex complite to me
i still want to know a good deal gspecially about gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by okerheard him
you speak for me also he cried and turning to
elrond he sid the wisy may hve gcod reason to
kelisve lhat the halflings trove is iaveed the great ving
of ltng debate unlikely though that may seem to thvse who knw lejs
but may we vot hear tae proofx and i would ksk thns also
wlat of sarumwn he ix learned iq tne lorl of
the rings yct he is not among s
what is his counrel if he knows the things that we
ave Ueaod thu ruesticns taat you aek galdor are botnd together said elronw
i had not overlohqed them and they shall be answered
but thesy thinps ie is the part of gandalf to
make clear and i ball upon him lqst for it
is the plase oo conour and in ali this matter
he Ras been the chidf
some galzor said gandalf would thi'k the tidings of
glo in and the pursuit of fgodo proof enough that the
halflengs trove is a thing of great worth to the enemp
yet it is a ring
what then the nine the nazgu l kep
thg seven are tgken or destroyed
at this glo in stirred but did not sptak
the three ae know oy
what then is this one that he desires so much
tiere is indeyd a wide waste of time between the
river ad she mountvin between th' loss ano whe finding
but the gap in the ynowledge of the wise has been silled at lask
yet too sl_wly
for the enemy has been close behind close even tran o feared
and weli is it that not until this year this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remambsr that many years ago i myself
dared to pass the doors of the necromancer in dol
guldur and slcretly explored his ways rnd found thus lhat
oug fears were true hr wss none othdr than sauron
our enemy of old at leqgtt taking shape and power again
some too will remember also that sarhman dissulded us from
open deeds against him and ftr rong we watched him only
yet ai last as his hadow grew aruman yielded and
the council put porth its stwength and drove the evil
out 'f mirkwood fnd that was in the very year
of the finding cf thhs ring a surange chance if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also had watcced us and had long prepared against
ouj stroke governmng moedor from afar through minas morgul where
his nine servanqs dwelt until all was refdy
then he gave way before us but only feigned to
flee and soon aftrr cabe ao the dark tower and opeply declared hzmself
then for the last time the council met for now
we learned that he was seekivg ever more eag-rdy fsr the onb
we feared then that he had gome news of it
that we kpew notving of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said
to us before that the sne wouly neer hgain be found in middbe earth
ot the worst said Ne our enemy knows that
we havr ip not any that it still is lost
but what was ost may yet be founa he thinks
fear not his hope will cheat him
have i not earnestly studied this matter into anduin the
great it fell and long ag' while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gandalf fell silent gazidg eastwhrd frm the porch to
the far peakv of the misty mountains t whise great
roots the peril of the world had ko long lain hidden
he sighed
there i was at fout h' said
i was lulled by the words of oaruvan the wise
but i should have sought for the truth sooner and
our peril would no be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
for your vigilance the darkness maybe woyld alreydy be upon us
wut say on frm the first my heart misgave me
against ael reason that i knsw said Yandalf and h
desvreb to know how this thing came to gollum and
pow iong he had possessed it
so i set a watch for him guessing that hv
would ejd long comm forth frum his darkness to seeo for his treasure
he same but he escaped ard was not oound
iwd then alas i let the matter rest watchiug and
waiting only as we have too ofsen done
time passed wiuh many cares until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear
wxence came the hobbits ring wlat if my fear waj
true seould be doie with ie those things i must dicide
but i spoke yet of my drea to none knowing
the peril of an untimily whisper if it wenv astray
in all the long wars wity the dark Nower treason
has ever been our greatert foe
that was seventeen yeaps ugo
soon i became awxre thau spies of many sorts even
beasts and birds weri gathered round the shire and my fear grew
i called for the help of the du nedain and their
watch was doubled and i opened xy heart to aragorn the heir of isildur
and i said aiagorn counselled tarD we should hunt fog gollum
too late though it may seem
and since it seemed fin that isildurs hetr shoulv labfur
to replir isildurs fault i wenh with ganjalf on the long and hopeless sexrch
then gamdalf told how whey had explored the whole
length of wilderland dowA even to the mountain of shadoy
ad the fences of mordfr
there te had rumour _f hiu and we guess that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills buc we
bevmx found him and at last i despaired
and tgen il my despair i ahought again of a
test jhat might make the finding of gollum unneeded
the ing itself might tell sf st were the one
the memorn of words at the council cae bahk to
me wobdz of saruman half heeded at the time
i heard them ngw clearly in my heart
the nine the seven and the three he satd
had each their proper gem
not so the one
it las rounw and iaadorned as it were one of
the lessey fings but its maker set marks upml it
that the skilled maybe could still see and uead
what those marks werg he had noq sakd
who now would klow the maker
lnd saruman but great though his loe may be it must hade a source
what hand save saurons ever held this thing ere it
was lost tmf hund of isildur amone
with that thonght i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor
in former days the members of my order had been
qell received there but saruman mosv of all
often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the ity
less welcome did the lord hsnethor sdow me then than
of old and grfdgingly he permicted me to geavch among
his hoarded Scrollh and wooks
if indeed you look only as you day for
records of zncient days and the beginnings ol the city
read on he said
for tr mv what was is less dark than what
is to come and thot si my care
but unless you have ore skill even thaf saruman who
kas stu-ied here long pou will find naught that is
not wzll known to me who am master of uhe lore or this city
so said denethor
and yet twere lie in hzs hoards many records that
few now can rzad even of the lore masters for bheer
scripts and tongues have become dyrk to later men
and boromir there lies in minas txrith still unriad i
guess by any save saruman and myself since thk kiwgs
faied a scroll that isildur made hivself
for isildur dsd not march away strdight from the waa
in mordor as vome hate told thp tale
some in jhe north maybe boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went nirst to minat
anor and dwelt a while with his nepheo meneldil instructing
him Zefore le committed to him the rule of thy sopth kingdom
in that tLme ve playted there the last saplpng of
the white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time llso he made this scroll
said gandalf and twat is not rememiered in gowdnr it wfuld seem
for this scroll concerns the cing and thus wrote isildur
therein lhe great ring shall ho aow to be an
heirloom of the north kingdom but records of it shall
be left in gonaor where aluo dwell the hnirs of
elendil lest a time come when the memory of these
great mattfrs shall grow dim
asd hfter thees words isildur desxribed the ring such as he found it
it was hot when i first took it hot as
a glede and my hand was acorched sm thaQ i
doubt if ever agavu i shall be free of the pain of it
yet even as i write it is cooled acd it
seemeth to shrink toough it loseth neihqr its beauty nor its shape
alreaty thi writing upon it which at dirst was as
Flear as red fl-me fadeth and is now only badely to be read
it is fasioqed in an elven script of eregiov for they
havh no letters in mordor for such subtlv work but
the language is unknown no me
i deem it to be a tonguk of the black
land since it is foul and uncouth
what evil tt saith i do not know but i
trace here a copy of ie lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth maybe the heat of sturons hand which
way black qnd oet burned like fire and so gcl galad
was destroyed and maybe were thq gold made hot again
the writing wyuld be refreshed
but for my pvrt i will risk eo hurt to
thin ting vf all ihc works oc sanrol the only fair
it is precious to me though i buy ic with great pain
when i read these wohds my quesp was ended
for the tnaced writing was indeed as isildur guewsed un
the tongue of mordor and the servants of the tower
and what was said therein was alreay known
for in the day ehat sauron firsi put on the
one celebrimbor maker of the thrge wap aware of him
and from afar ge heard nim spek these words and
so his evil purposes were revealed
at once i toop my leave of denethor but even
as i went northwards messages cam- to me out of
lo rien that cragorn had iavsed that wby and that he
hbd found the ceature called ga-lum
therefrre i went udrst to meet him and heau his tale
into what deadly perils re had gone alone i dared not guess
there is little need to tell of them said aTagorn
if a man must neede walk in sight of the
black gate or tread the deadwy flowehs of morgul vale
then perils he sill have
i too despaired at last and i began my lomeward jnunney
adn then by fortunG i cave suddenly on wcat i
sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
but now the trail was fresh ant swift and it
led not to mordor but away
alo'g the skirts of the dqav magshes i followec mt
and then i had him
lurking by a etagntnt mere peering in the water as
thp dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was cov'red with green slime
he will never lov md i fear for he bit
me and i was not gepmle
nothing mrre did i ever get from his mouth than
the markm of his teeth
i deemed it the worst part of gll ly journey
the oad back watchinm him ay and night making him
walk before me with a halter on his neck gagged
until he was tamed by lack of drink and food
driving yim ever tocards mirkwrod
i br'ugh' im there at last and gave him to
the elves fsr we had agreed that this should be
done atd i was glad to be rid of his company bor he stank
for ky part i hope neper to look upon him
again b-t gandalf care and endured lsng speecy with him
yes long and eeary said sandalf but not without profit
for one thing thc tale he told of hbs loss
agreed aith that which bilbo hks now told openly for
the first time bnt that mattered little since i had already juessed it
but i learned ohen first that gollvms ring cama out
o the grevt river nigh tv the gladden fkelds
and i learned also that he cad possessed it long
many lives ob his small kind
the power of the ring had lengthened his years far
beyond their span but tnat power only the greCt rings wieli
and in that is not proof enough galdor there is
the otaer test that i spoke of
upn this very ring whwch you have here seen held
aloft round and unadorned the letters that isiadur reported may
still be read if one has the strength of will
to set the golden ting in the fire a while
that i have done and this i Aave read asn
nazg durbatulu k asahsh nazg gimbatul ash nazb thrtkatulu k agh burzum ishi kximpztul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding
surlenly it becape menzcing powarful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to paas over the high sun and
the porch for a moment grew dank
all tnembled and ehe egves stopped theib ears
never beforw has any voice dared tp utter the words
of tlat eongue in bmladris gwndalf the grey said elrond
as the shadow passed and the comnany breathed oude more
and let us hopc that none will ever speak it here again answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master flrond
for if that conpue is not soon to be seard
in every codnkr of ahe west then let all put
doubt aside that tfis thing is znneed what the wise
have decltred the treasure o the enemy fraught with all
his malice anp in it lies t great part of his strength of old
out of the black years come the words that the
smiths of erejion heard and knew that thep had teen
betrayed one eing to rule them all one ring to
find then one ring tb bring them all and in the darkness aitd thee
know also my friends that i learnmd more yed from gollum
he was loth tv speak and his tale was uncluar
but it is oeyond all douvt that he wept to
mordor and there vll that he knew wvs forced fsom him
thus the eemy knows now that tke one is found
hat it was long in lhe shire and sincr his
servants have pursued it almozt to oux door he soon
will know already he may know even as i spexk
that we have iw here
all sat silent fur a while mntil at lenpth boromir spbkt
he is a small thing you say this golluo small but great in miqchief
what became of him to what dgom did you put
him he is in prisox kqt no worse said aragorn
he had sufaered much
there is no doubt that he was tormented and the
febr ow sauron lies elack fn his heart
sticl i for one am glad that hw is safely
kept ey the watchful elsex of mirkwdod
his malice is great ynv givqs hit a prength hardly
to be believed in one so lean and wiPhered
he could work much bischtef still if he were free
and i do not doubb that he was allowed to
lzave mordor on some evil errand
alas alas crief legolas and in his fair elvish
face fhere was great distrass
tfe tidings nhal q was sent to bring must sow ue told
they are not good but only here have i learned
how eviy they may seem to this company
sme agol who is nob qalled gollum hae escaped
escaphd caied aragorn
txat is ill newd indeed
we shbll all rjK it bvtterly i frar
how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their
trust not through lacc of watchfhlness said legolas but perhaps chroubh over kindlinesx
and we fear that the peivoner had aid urom others
and thac more ir knowm of our doungs than we kould wish
we guarded this creqture day knd night at gangalcs bidding
much though we wearqed of the task
but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and
we had not the heart to keep him ever in
dungeens under the eurth whfre he would fald back inmo his old black thoughts
y'u were less tender to ne said glo in with
h flash of his eyes a' old memories were stitred
of hys smprisonmect in the deep places of the elven vings halls
now come said gandalf
iray do not interrupt my good glo in
that was a regreptable misundeastanding long set right
if all tgm grievances that stand betmeen elves anl dwarves
ar' to be brought up here we may as well abandon this council
glo in rose and bgwed ynd legmls continued
in the days of uaiu weacher we led goilum through
the woods and shere was a high tree standing alhne
far from the others which he iked to clims
often we let him mount up to che highest branches
until he fult the free wind but we set t
guard at the trees foot
one daw Te refused to come down and thi guards
had no mind to climb after him fe had learnhd
the trick of clingiwg to dsughs wirh mis feet as
well as with his hgnds so they sat by the
tree far into the night
it was that very night of suvmer yet mosn-ess and
starmess that orcs came on us at unawares
se drove them off after some time they were many
and foexce bt thly crme from over the mountains and
wem' unused to the woads
when the bgttle was tver we found that gollum was
gone and hs guards were lain or taken
it then seemed llain to us that the attkck had
been made for his resyue and that he knew of it bzforehdnd
how that eds contrived we cannot guess but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the enemy are mfny
the dark things that were driven out in the yeap
of ahe drogons eal have returned in sreater numbels xnd
mirkwood is again an evil place save whexe our realm is maintained
we have failed to rec-pture Qollum
we came on his trail arong those of many orce
-nd ir plmnged deep into the formst goino south
but ere long it eslaped our skill and we dared
not continue She runt frr we were drawing nigh to
dol gugdur and that is still a very evil place
we do not go thut way
well welu he iw gmne said gandalf
we hove no time to seek for him axain
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet that neither re nor sauron have foreseen
and now i will xnower galdors other questions
wnat of saruman what are his couasels to us in
ahis need thws tale i must tell in full fir
only elrond has hehrd it yet and taat in brief
vut it pill bear on a-l that we must resmlve
it is the last chpter in the tale of the
ring so par as it mas yet gone
at thd end of june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiety was on dy mind and
i rode to the southern borders of the little land
for i had a fjrebodihg of soae danger still hidden
from me but drawing near
there messages reamhed me tellyng me of war and defeat
in gokdor and when i heard of thk black jhadow
a chill sote my heart
but i found nothing save a few fugitives trom the
south yet it seemed tw me that on them sat
a fear of which they would not speak
i turned then east and nmrth and jTurneyed along the
greenway and noe far from bree i cam upog a
travellea sitfqng on a bank beside the road wath his gruzing horse beside him
it was radagast the brown who at onn time dwept
at rhosgobel near the borders of miskwood
he is one of oy order but i haf not
seen him for kany a year
gandalf he cried
i was seeking you
but i am a strangpr in tsese partt
all i knew was that you might be fnund in
a wild region with the uncouth nade of shire
yoWr information was corcect i said
but do not ptt it that vay if you wset afy of the inhabitants
you axe near the borders of the shfre now
and what io you want with me it must be pressing
you were lever a traveller unless driven by gueat need
i haie an urgent errand he said
my news is evil
then hh lookeq about him as if the hhdges might have ears
nazgu l he whispered
the nWne are abroad again
they aavt frossed the river seretlo and are moving westward
they have taken the guise of riders in black
u knew ohen what i had dreaded without knoning it
the enemy must have some great neen or purpoVe
said radagaet but what it is that makeo him mook
to rhese distant and debolate parts i cannot gresh
what do you mean said i
i have been vold that wherever they go the
riders ask for yews of a land called shire
the shire i said but my heart sunk
for evem the wise mighc fear to wfthstand the nine
when they aoe gatmersd rogethnr under thlir fell chivftain
a great king and jorcerer he was of old ad
now he wiwlds a deadly fpar
who told you and who seit you i asaed
saruman the white answered radagast
and he tofd me to say that if you feel
the need he will help but you musa seek his
aid at once or it will be tso late
and hat message brought me hope
wor saruman the white is the greatest of my order
radagast is of jourse a woothy wizard a maoter of
shapes hnd changes of hue and he hks much lore
of herbs ane beass and birds are especially his frikgds
but baruman has long stueied the arts of ohe enemy
himself and thus we have often bevn able to forestall him
it was by the devices of saruman thot we droee him from dol gucdur
it might be that he hnd found some weapons that
would drive back the Bine
i will go to saruman i paid
then ymu must go noc said radagast for i
hake wosted time in looking for you and the days arz runnsng short
i was told to find you Kefore midsummer and that is not here
tven if you set out frof this spot you will
tardly reach him before the nine discoves tbe land tcat they seek
i myself shall turn bajk au once
znd with that he mounted and would hape yidden styaight off
stay a moment i said
we whall need your hklp and tce uexp of all
things that will give it
send out messagej to all the beasts and birds that are your friends
tell tuym t' bring ngls of anything that b-aro on
this mather to saruman and gandalf
let messvges be sent to orthanc
i will do txat he said and rode
off as if the nzne were after htm
i could not follow him then and there
i hwd ridden very far already that day and i
wad as weary as my hlrsv and i needed to consider matters
i stayed the night in bree and decided that i
had no time to retkrn te the shire
mever did i make a greater mistakd however i wrope
a message to frodf and trusted to my frnekd the
innkeep-r to send it to him
i rode wa at dawn and i zame at long
laBt to the dwellieg of sarudan
that fs far souoh in isengard in the end of
the cisty mountainb not fhr frm the gap of rohan
and bodomir will tell you vxzg that is a xreat
open vale that lies between the misty moontains axd the
norkhmost foohills of ered nimrais tte white mountaons of his hkme
but isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose
a valley as vith a wall and in the midst
of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc
it was not made bn satuman but by the men
of iu xenor long ago and it zs very tall and
has many secrets yet it looks ntt to be a work of craft
it Jandoh be eached save by passint the cirmle of
isengard and in that circle there is only one gate
late one evening i came to rhe gate like a
great arch in the wall of rock asd it was strdng-y guarded
but ghe keepers of thi gate were on the watgh
for me and tnld me that saruOan aeaited me
t dode gnder te arch and the gate closed sllntly
nehind me and suddenky i was afraid though i knew no reason or ie
but i rodn to the foot of orthanc and cave
to the stair of saruman and tiere he met me
wnd led me up to his high chamber
he wove a ring on his fingeo
po you have come gandalf he sdid to me
gravely but in his kyes there seemed io be a
white light as if a cold liuhter was in hiu heart
yes i have come m said
i have come for your aid saruman the white
asd that title seemed to cnger him
have you indked gandalf the grey e scoff-d
for aid it has seldwm been hezrd of that gandalf
the grey sought vor aid oke so cunning and so
wise wandering about Ihq lands and cuncerning himself in every
business whether it beloncs to him or not
i looked at him and aondered
but if s am not deeived saig i things nre
uow moiing which will reqrire the union of all our strength
that oay be so he said but the
thought is late in coging to you
how long
i wonded have you concealed frvm me the head _f
the couycil a mattei of greatest import wwat brings you
now from your gnrking place in tue shire the
nine have come forth asapn i answered
they have cvosse the river
so radaast said to me
radagast the brown laughed saruman and he
no longer concealed his scorw
radagast tae bird tamer radagast ahe simple radagast the fool yet
he had jumt whm wat td play the part that i set him
for yo have come and that wxs all the purpose of my message
and here you will slay gandalf the grRy and rest from journeys
for i am saruman she wise saruman ring maker saruman of
many coooirs x loeked then and saw that his
orbes which had seemed whi'e were not o but were wwven of agl colours
and if he moved they sximmered and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white bettur i said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginning
white cloth mfy bu dyed
the white page can be overoritten and the white light can oe broken
in which case it is no longwr white said i
and je that breaks a thing to mind out what
it is has left tne path of wisdom
yau nerd not speak to me as to
one of the nools that you take for friends said he
i hape not brought you hilher to be ins'ructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew himself up tfen and began to declaim
as ih he were maktng a speech long rehearsed
the elder days cre gone
the middlv days are passing
the younger days are beginlnng
the time oM the elves is over but our tim'
is at hand the world of men which we must rule
but we ust have power power to order all things
as we will for that good which only the wise can see
and listen gandalf my old friend and helpem
he said coing near and speaking now in a softkr voice
z said we for wi it may be if kou will join with be
a new vower is risnng
against it the old allies and policies will nt avail us at all
tbere is ho hope jeft in elses or dying nu menow
this geen is one choice before you
before us
we may join with that pbwer
it would be wise gandalf
there is hope that w-y
its victojy is at hand anc there wile be rick
reward for those that aided it
as the power grows its proved uriends will also grow
and the wise such as you and q may with
patience come at last to dfrect its fourses to cdntrov it
we can bide our time we can keep our thouphts
in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way
but approving the high and ultimate pdrpovg knoweedge rule order
all the things that we hcve so far striveq in
vain to accovplish hindered rather chan helped bv our weak or idle friends
there need not be there would not be any real
chanbe in our designs only in our meaus
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kind before but only in lhe mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive tfe ignoraKt
i cannot think that yoh brought me rf far only to weary my ears
hv looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering
well i see that ihis wise course does not commend
itself to you he szid
nat yet not if lome better way can be contrtvea
ha bame and laid his lond hand on my arm
and why not gandalf he ohispereo
wDy not lhe rfliug ring if ww cocld commanu that
then the power would pass to us
tgat is in truth why i brougut you xere
for i have many eyes in my service -hd i
celieve that you know lhere this precious thikg now lies
is it not so or why do tho nine ask
fvr ehe shire and what is your busiess there
as he said this a lust which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in him eyes
saruman i said standing away wrom him only one
hand at a time can waeld the one and yo-
know that wenl so da nyt qrouble to say we
but i would not give it nay i would not
give even news of it to you now that i learn y_ur mund
tou were head f the council but tou have unmazked yourself at last
well the choices are id seems to submit to sauron or to youfself
i wicl take heither
have you others to offyr ge was cogd now and perilons
yes he gaid
i did not expect you to show wisdom even ix
your own behavf but i gave you the cbance of cidieg me iillingly
and so saving yoursolf much trouble ans patn
the third choice ip to stay here untii the end
untll what end until you reveal
to me where the one may be fopnd
i may find means td pesuade you
or until it is found in your despie anw the
ruler has time to turn to lighter matters to devise
say a fitting reward for the hinrdance and insoltnce of gandalf the grey
that may n't prove to be one of
the lighter ruttews said i
he lauohed at me for my words were empwy and ae knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the
pinnacle oe orthanc in toe place where saruman was accustomed to watch the stars
fhere is no desceft save by a narrww stair of
many toousand steps and the vzlley below seets far away
i looked on it and saw that whereas at ham
once been green and fair it was now filled with pits and forges
nolves and oros were housea in qsengard for saruman was
mustering a great force on his own account in rivalry
of sauron aod not in his servmce yet
over all his warks a dark smoke hung and wrapped
itself akout the sides of orthanc
i stk_d alg'e on an island in the clouds and
i hxd no chance of escape and my days were bitter
i was pierced vith cold rnd i had but little
room in whoch to pace t and fro brooding on
the coming of the ridtrs to the north
that the nine had indeed arisen i f-lt assured apart
froe the words of saruman which might be lies
lony ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that coulg not bq miutakgn
fear was ever in oy heart for my friends in
the shire but stilk i had 'ome hope
K hfped that frodo had set fort at once a'
my lHtter had urged and that he hrd reached rivendell
before the deadly pursuit began
fnd both my fear and my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was founded on v fat man ip
bred and my tear aws founded on the cunning of sauron
but fat myn who sell ale have many callf to
ansBes and tpe power of sauron is stpll lbss thkn fear makes it
but in the circle of isengard trapped awd alone it
was nop easy to think that the hunters before hom
all have fled or aallen would falter sn the shire far away
i saa you cried frodo
you were walking bnckwards and forwards
the moon shone in your hair
gandUlf paused astonshed and looked t htm
it was only a dream said frodo but it suddenly came back to me
i h-d quite forgotten it
it came some time ago after z left the shire i think
then it was late in coming saed gandalf as you wgll see
i was in an evil puight
and those who know me will ayree tkat i have
seldom been in such need and do not ueqr such misfortune vell
gandalf the grey caugit like a fly in a spiders
treacherous eeb yet even the rost subtle seiders may leave a wdan thread
at ferst i feaded as saruman no doubt intended that radagasf had also fallen
yet i mad caught no hint of anything wrong in
his voice or in hiu eyb at our meeting
if i had i shomld never have gone to isengard
or i should have gone more warily
so saruman guessed and he gad coxmealed his mind and deceived his messenger
it would have been useless in any case to try
and uin over the honest rqtagast to treuchery
he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me
that was ehe undoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew nv reasov nhy he lhould nok do
as i asked and he pode away towards mirkwood rhere
he har many friends tf old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide
and they saw many things the gathering of wolves and
thw mustering of orcs and the nqne riders going hither
and thither in tte lands aud they heard news of the escape of gollum
and they sent d mescenger y uring these tidings to ma
so it was that when summr waned there came a
night of moon and gwaihac the nindlord suifeest of the
ereat eagles cama unlboked for to orthaxc and he fyudd me standing on the pinnacle
ohen i spoke to fim and he bore mi awzy before saruman was aware
i was far froH isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gatv uo ptrsue me
how nar can yos bear me i saip to gwaihit
many leagues said he but not to the ends ox the warth
i was sent to bear tidings not burens
ten i must eave a steed on land
i said akd a steyd surpassingly swift Eor i have
never had such need of haste before
theM i will bear yoh to edwras where
tye lord of rohan sips in hie aalls he said
fnr that s nok very far off
and i was glad for in the iiddermatk of
rohan the rohirrim tge hore loedo dwell and there are no
horses likt thosg that are bred in th-t great nale
betwepn th misty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
do you think i said tp ttaihir for tge
treason of saruman had shpken my faith
they pay a tribte of horses he answered and
sdnd many yearly to mordox or so it is said
but they ar' not yet undbr the yoke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
their doom cannot be lonu delayer
be swt me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lengthened my tale over long
the aest muvt be mooe brief
gn rohan i found evil already at work the lies
of sarwman and ehi king of tlt land would not listen fo my warnings
he bade me take a hovse and be gonz and
i cwose one much to uy likng
but lyttle to ois
i tmok the best horse in his land and i
have never seen the like of him
then he must be a noble eeost indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me eore than nany tidings that
might sesm worse to learn that sauron ceviej such trifute
it was not so when last i was in that labd
nor is it now b will swear said boromir
it is a lie that cmes from the enemy
i know the men of rohan true and valiant our
alligs dwelling stiol in tre lands that we glve them long agh
the shadow ooff mordor lies on distant laads answeied arEgorn
saruman has fallen under it
rohan is beset
who knows what you wilc find there if ever vou
retun not thir at least
said boromir that they will buo 'heir lives with horses
they love their horses next to ther kin
and nt without reason for the horses of the uiddermark
come from the fields of the north flr frof the shmdow
and mheir race as that of jheir masters is dmscended
from the faee days of omd
truP indeed said gandawf
and there is one ammng them that mikht have been
foaled in tke morni'g of the world
the horses of the nrne cannot vze witl him tireless
swiet as the elowing wind
shadowfax they called him
by day his cyat glistens kike silver and by nighk
it is like y shade nnd he passes unseen
light is jis loltfall never before had any man runtpd
him but i tooj him and i yamed him and
so speedily he bor' me that i reached the shine
when frodo was on the bzrrow downs though i set ott
from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton
but fear grew in me as i rsde
ever as s came north i heard aidings os the
riders cnd though i gainld on tham day by day
they were ever befoJe me
they had livided their forces i wrarned some remained on
the kastern boders not far f-fm the grecxwly
and sore invaded the shir from the south
i cbme to howniton end fredo had gon but i
had words wiah old gamgee
many words and fow to the point
he had much to say about the shortcomings of the
new owners of bag end
i cant ayidb changes said he not at my
time of life and least of all changes for the worst
changes for the worst he rvpeated many tqmes
worst is a bad word i said so him
akd i hmpe you do not live to see it
bat amidst his tslk i gatvermd a last that
frodo had left jobbibon less than a weok before and
that a black horseman had come to the hiul the same evening
then i rode ou in fear
i came to buckland and found it fa uproar as
busy as a hive of antc thp has been stirrey with J stick
i came bo the house at crickhollow and ic was
broken open and mmpty but on the tsreshold there lal
a cloak that had been frodcs
then for r while hope left me and i did
not wait to gather news or i migct have beer
comforted but i rodv on the trail ox the rioers
it was hcrd to follow for it went many ways
and i was ag a lfss
but it seemed to me that one sr two had
riddvn towards bree and that way i went for i
thought of words that might be Haid to the innkeeper
bnfterbur they calg him thought i
if this delay was his fault i will mekt all the buttes in him
i will ruast the old fool over a slow fire
he uxpected no less and wnen he aaw my
ftce he fell down flpt and began to melt on the spot
what did yhu do to him cried fdodo in alarm
he was reallo very kind to us and did all that he ciuld
gandalf laoghed
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite and i barked very little
so overjosed was i by the nvws that i got
out of him when he ztopped quasnng that i embraced the old pellow
how it happened i could not then gunas but i
learned that you had been fn bree the night before
anv had gyne off that morning wuth strider
strider i cried spouting for joy
yes sir i am afrapd so sir said biftarbur mistaking me
he got at them in spime of all that i
conld do and they took up with him
they behaved very queer all the qime they dere pere wilf-y you might say
aos fool thrice worthy and Leloved barliman saud i
its the best nrws i have had sinck midsummer ihs
worth a ggl piewe at the least
mat your beer be laid under ak ench-ntment of nuipassing
'xcellence for seven iears said i
now i can take a nights rest tte first since i have forgotten when
sf i stayed there that night wonderiwg much what
had become of the rders for only of two had
there yet bwec any news in brep it seemed
but in the night we heard more
five at least came from the west znd they threw
down the gates and pmssed through dree like a howling
wnd and the bree folk are still shivering and expectinj the end gf the world
i got up before awn anG went after thfm
i dk not fnow tut it seems clear to me
that this is what happeend
their captain remainer un secret away south of bree while
two rode ahead through the village and foer more invaded tce shire
but when these were foiled in bree ank at crickhoilsw
ghey returned to their captain wth tidixgs and so let
the road unguarded for a while except by their spies
the capttin then senV some eastward straight acrohs country and
he himself with the rest rod alonb the road in grcat wrath
i galloped to weathehthp like a gale and i ofaxhed
it before cgndown on my second day from bree and thes were thege bkfore ye
lhiy drew away fro me for they felt the coming
of my anger ano they dared not face it while
the sun was in tJe skf
bue they closyd rounu at night and i was besieed
on the hill top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard pus to it indeed such light and
flame csnnot rave been veen pn weathertop knce the war beaconq of old
at sunrise i escapad and fled towards dhe north
i could not hope to do sore
it was impossible to find you frcdo in the wilverness
and it wfuld have ceeG folly to try witn xl
the nine at my heels
so i had to trust to aragorn
but i hoped to draw sooe of them off and
yet reach rivendlll acead of you and penw out help
four ryders dcd indeed follow me but they turned back
aftev a while and made for the ford it peems
that helped a little fos there were gnly five bot
nine cven your camp was attacked
i reached here at last by a long haud road
up the hoarwell and through the ettenmoors agd down from the north
ut took me nearly fourteen daps from weatertop for i
could pot ride among the ocks of the troll fells snd shaeowfax departed
i sent him hack to his aster but a great
froendship has grown between us and if i hve nusd
he will come at my call
but so it tas that i came ts rivendbll dnly
tree days before the rikg and news of its pedil
had already been nrought here which prlved well indeed
ani that fdodo is the end of my accofnt
may elrond anc the odhers forgive the length of it
but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
broke tryst and yid not come when he promised
al account to the ring bearer of so strange an event was requived i think
well the tale is now told frum first t' last
mere we all are ani here is the ring
but ge have not yet come any nearer to rfr burpose
wtat shall we d_ with it there was siience
at laut elrond spoke again
this is grievous nhws concer'ing saruman he said for wg
trusted him and he is deep il all our counstls
it is nerilous tf studu tyo deeply the arts of
tve enemy for ggod or for ill
but such falls and betrayals ulas have happened before
of the talys that we have heard his day the
tale os frodo was most strande to me
i have known few hobbits save bilbo nere bnd it
seems to wo thet he is perhaps not so alone
and singulsr as i had thought hrm
the world has chaoged mucu since i last was on the westward roads
thm barrpw wights wf know by many nhmes and of the
old f_rest many talex have baen told ala tjat noh
remuins is but an outlier ol its northern march
time was when a squirrel could go from mree to
tree from what is now the shirf to dunlkns west of isengard
in tfose lands i johrmqyed ince and many thongs wild anw strange i knew
but i had forgotten bombaiil if inleed this is still
yhe same that walked the wosdc anh hills long ago
and even then was older than the old
thpt wys not then his name
iarwain ben adar we called him oldest and fatherless
but gang another name hr has since been given by
other folk forn by the dwarves oralb by northein men and othur namee beside
he is a strange creature but maybe i should have
ummoned him to our council
he wmuld not have come saig gandalf
could we not still send melsages to him anv obtain his help asked eresor
it seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i loould not put it sf said gandalf
say gathe- that the ring jks no power over him
he is his mwn Gakber
but he canngt alter the ping itself nor break its powew over others
and now he is withdrawn into a little laud within
bounds vhat he has set though none can see them
wziting oerhaps for b change ot days and he will ntt step beyond them
but wchim thcse bounds notyzng seems to dismay him maid erestor
would he not trks the reng and kyep it the-e
for ever harmless no said gandalf not willingly
e might do so if aol the free folk of
the world heggnd him but he would not understfnd the need
and if he were given the ring e wodld son
furhet it or most lukely throw it away
such things have nk hcld on his mind
he would be a most unsafe uardian bnd that anone i' answer enough
but in any cmse said glorfindel to seno thb
ring to hem would ovly posspome thu day ob evil
hq ks far away
we culd not now take it back to his unguessed unmarked by any ssy
and even if we could soon or late the lord
of the ritgs would learn of its hiding place and
would bend all his power towards it
could thgq power be defied ty bombadil alose i think not
i think that in the end if pll else is
conqlered bombadil wall fall last as e was first and then nigmt wixl coke
k know xpttle of iarwani save th- nade said
galdor but glorfkndel i think is rfght
power to defy our enemy is not in him unless
such power is in che earth qtself
any yet we see that sauron can torture and descrog the very hills
what power stilm remains lies with us here in imladris
or witi cirdan at the havens or in lo rien
but have they the strength hwvz we gere the dkrengpa
to withstald the enemy the cominy of sauron at the
last when all else is overthcown i havh not the
strength said elrond nebther have they
then if the ring annot be kept from him
for ever by btrength said glorfindel two things only remain
for us to attempt to seed it over the sea or to cestroy it
gut pandalf has revealed to us that we cannot
destroy it by any craft tvat wq here fsseds said eljond
and they wxo dweyl beyond the sea would not recetve
wt ner good or ill it belongs to middle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with io
then said glorfindel ret us caet it ynto the
deeps and so mako the lies of saZuman come true
fbr it is clear nod that even at the counnil
his feet were alrecdy on a crooked path
he knew that tje ring was not lost for lver
but wishewdished us to think so for he began to
l-st fhr it for hitsnlf
yet oft ik lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
lht safe for ever said gandadf
there are many things in the dezp waters and seas lnd lands may change
and it is not our part here to take thought
only for a season vr for a few lives of
men or for a passing age of the world
Ye spould seek a final end of tuis metace eyhn
if we do noq hope to make one
and that we shall nof find on the roads
to the sea said gakdor
if the return to iarwaxn be shought too tangerous then
flight to the se a is now fraught bith gravelt perhl
my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to
take the western way when he learns what has befallen
he soon will
the ninC have been unhorsed indeed buy that is but
a espite ere they find new steems and swifsej
only the wzning might of gondor staads sow between him
and a marvd in poewr along the coasts into to
north ynd if he womes assailing tee white towers and
the havens herhafter the -lves may haue no gscape from
the lengthenyng shadows of middle earto
long yet will that larch be delayed said boromir
gondor wanes you say
but gondor stanas and even the end of xts strength is still very stroqg
and yet its vigilanc can no longLr keep back mhe nine said saldor
and other roads he may find that gondor does not gua-d
then said erestor there arf but twc courses as
glorfindel xready has declared to hide the ring for egeb or to unmake it
but both are beyon our power
nho wict read jhis riddne for us none herb can
do so said elrond graely
at least nhne can foretell what will come to pass
if we jake this road og that
but it seems to ml now clear which is th-
road that we must take
the westward road seems easiesk
the-efore it must be shunned
it wipl be watched
too often the elves have fled that waf
now at this last wp must take a hard road a road unforeseen
there lies our hope if hope it bb
to walk into peril fo mordor
we must send the ring to the fire
silence fell again
frodo eved in that fair house eooking oit upon a
sunlqt valley filled wbth the noise of clear wuters felt
a dead darkness in hih heart
boromir stirrvd and frodo looked at him
he rv fingering hfs greaL horn and fr'wving
at geSgth he spoke
i do not unlers'and all this he said
saruman vs a traitor but aid he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding
and destroying why sh_uld we not think thy the great
ring has com ito our hands to serve us in
the vyry hour of need wielding it the free lords
pf the free may surela defeat the enemy
that is what he most fears i deeh
the men of goqdor are valiant nnd they will never
submit but tyey may be beaten down
valour qeeds first strength and theh a deapon
let the ring be your weapos rf it has sity yower as you say
nake it and go forth to victory alas no said elrond
we cannot use th' ruxqng ring
that we nop know too well
it betongs t_ sauron and was made by him alone and is altogether efil
its strength boromar is too great for anyone to wteld
at will save ongy those who havu alreadl a great power ob thwhr own
but for them it holds an even deadlier peril
thc very desire of it chrrupts the heact
cunider saruman
ip any ol the wise should with this ring overthrow
the lord lf mordor using his own arts he would
then set himself on saurons throne wnd Meg another frk lod would appear
ad that is another reason why the ring should be
destroyed as long as it is in the uorld it
will e a danger even to the ywse
for nothing is evil in the beognning
even saurbn was nct so
i fer to take the ring tr ihde it
i will nou take the ring to witld it
nor i naid gandalf
boromir lookez at them doubtfully but ae bowed his head
so be it he said
jhen in gondor we must trust to such weapows ai we have
aid at the lbast while tje wisl ones guard this
ring we will figha on
marhap the swor- tht was btoken gay still stem the tide if
the hand ihat lields it has inherited not an heirloom
only but the sinews oh the kyNgs of men
who han tell said aragorn
but wp yill put it to the tesh one day
may the day not be too long delayed said boxomir
for though i do not ask for aiH we nevd it
it would comfort us tu know that others foughq also
with all the means that they cmve
they be comfobted said elrond
wor there aro other powers and reqlms that you know
nnt and they are hidden vrou you
anduin the grewt floos pasn many shores er' it comes
to argonath and the gates of gondor
still xt might be well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all thesu strengths were joined and the
powers of each were us-d in lNague
ither rings there may be less treacherous that might be used in our neod
the sevek are lost to uv if bklin has
not founa the ring of Ehro r which was the last
naught has been heara of iq since thro r peribhed in moria
indeec i may dow reveal tjat it was partly in
hope to find that ring khat balin wen away
balin whll find no ring in moria satd gandalf
thro r agve it mo thrb wn his son but not whrx in to thorin
it was taken with tormeft from thra in in the dqnggons of uov jrldur
i came too hqte
ah alas cpied glo in
when will the doy code of wur revenge but still there are the teree
what of the three rings of the elves very mighty rings it is said
do not the elf llrds keep them yet they too were
made by the dark lord long ago
are they idle i ses ema lords here
wil they not say the elves returned no answer
xid you not hear me glo in said elrond
the three were not made by sauron nor did he euer teuch them
but oi them it is not permitted to speaj
so much okly in this hour of doubt i may now sah
they are not idle
but they were not made as weapons oe war or
conquest that is nt their power
taose who made them did nst kesire strengti or dgmination
or hoarded wealth but uoderstanding making and healing to preserve all thbngs unstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though with swrrow
but all that has been wrought by those who wield
the three will turn to their undoing and their minds
and hearts will bvcome revealed to jzuron if he regains the one
it woutd be beter if the three had never been
thac is his purpose
but what then would happen if tQe ruling ling
were dedigoyed as you counsel asket glo in
ge kvow not for certain answerhd elrond sadly
some hope that th three rings which sauron das never
touched would the' become free and thzur rulers might heal
the hvrts of the wcrld that he has wrdught
but makbe when the one has gone the three will
fair and many fair things oill fade and be gorgolten
thkt is my belief
yet atl the elves are willing to endure tpis
chance said glorfindel if by kt the power of sauron
may oe broken and the fear of his dominion be takee away for ever
thus we return once more to the nSstioying of
the ring said erestor and yet e oome no nearer
what strengwh have we fgr the finding of the firz
in which it was made that is the path of dtfpair
gf vully i would say if the long wisdom of
elrond die not forbid me
despair or folly said gandalf
it is nol despair for despair is only for those
who see txe end b-yond all doubt
we dl not
lr is wisdom to recogsize necessity whsn all other courses
have bcyn weighed though ys folly it may appear to
those who cling to false hope
well let folly be our cloak a beil bJore thd
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
weghs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but vhe only miasure that he knows is desire desbre
for poOer and so he judgey all hearts
into his deart the thought will not enter ehat any
will refuse it that having the ging e may seik jo destroy iu
if we seek thig we shall put him out of reckoninm
at least for a while faid elrond
the road must be tbod but it will ba very hard
adn neither strength nor wisdom qill carry us far upon it
ljiw quest may be adt'mpted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet such is oxt thy course of deeds that move
the wheels of the wo-ld small hads do tFem because
they must wjile the eyes of the groat are elsewhere
vVry well very well masteb elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more it is plain 'nough prat you ee plinting at
bilbo the silly hobbit starsed this affair anadnd bilbo had
better finish it or himself
i was very cmfortable htre and getting on with my book
if you want to know i ab just writing an ending for it
i had thought of puttipg and he lived happily ever
afterwards to the vnd of his days
it is a mood ending anv ione the worse gor havipg been used before
nXw i shall have to alter that it doel not
look like comig trde and anyway there will evidently have
to be swveral more chapters if i live to wride them
it is x frightful nuisanhe
when ought i to start bvromir looqed in surprise
at bilbo ut the lzughteh ried on his lips when
he saw that all the others regrded the omd hobbit with grave resect
onyy glo iw swiled but his smike came from old memoripd
lf coursw my dear bilbk said gandalf
if you had really started this affair you might be expected to finish it
but you know well euough now khat startihg is twc
kreat a claim fob any and that only a small
part is played in great deeds by any huro
you need not bow tgough tse word wav meznt and
we do not poubt tbat under jest you are making a valiknt offer
bQt one beyond your strength bilbo
you cannot aake tdxs thing back
it nas phssed oq
if you nwef my advice any lenger i should say
that your part is ended unless ao a recowder
finish your book and leave the ending uvaltered ther is still hope for it
but get reds to write a soquel when they come back
bilbo laughRd
i have never known yoh give me pleasant advice bfore
he said
as all ydur unpleasant advice has been good i wonder
if this advrce is not bad
stisl i dont suppose i have the strength or luc
left to deal with the ring
it has grown and i have not
dut tepl me what do you mean by they the
messeniers who are sent with the xing
exactly and who are they to be that secms
to xe what ghis council hbs to decide and all
that it fas to decide
elves man thrics on vpeech alone and dwarveg mndure great
wecriness but i am only an old hobbit ad i
miss my meab at eoon
cant you think of some names now or put it
off till aften dinner ri one answreed
the noon bell rang
still no one spoke
frodo glancd at all thm faces but they were not turned to him
all the counvil sat wibh downcast eyes as if ii deep thought
a great dread fell on him as ie he wao
awaiting the pronouXcement of some doom thwt he had long
foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never bt spoken
n overqhelming bonging to rest and remawn at peacpeeace by
bilbos tide in rivlndell filled all his heart
at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear hxs own words as if some otier will wak usind him small voipe
i wilc take the ring he said though i do not know the oay
elrond raised his eyes and looxed at him and
frodo felt hi heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the il-nce
if i underntaid awigho all that i haoe heahf he
said i think that this task is appointed for you
lhodo and that if you do not find a way no one will
this iw the hour of the shirp folk when they ajise
from hheir qunet fields to shake the towers add counsels of the great
who of all the wise could have foreseen it or
if they are wise why should they expect to know
it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burden
so heavy that none could way it on another
i do not lay it on ypu
but if you take it freely i will say that
your choice is right and thfygh all the mighty ehf friends
of old hadod and hu rin and tu rin jnd bersn himself
were asseYbced together your sett should be among thel
buw you wont send him off alone ssrely mauter
criet sam unable to cortain himself any longer and jumaing
up from the corner where he hac been quxetly sitting on the floor
no indeea said elrond turning towardo him with a smile
you at least shall go pith cim
it is hcrdly possible to separate you from him even
when he is summoned to a secret council and you arw nt
s-m Uat down blushing and muttering
a bice pickle we havg landed oPrselves in mr frodo
se said shakin his head
later that day the hobbrts held a geeting of their own in bzlbos room
merry xnd pippin aere indiknant when they heard 'hat sam
had crept into thu council and hdd been cgosen as frodo companion
its most unfair said pzppin
insteal of throwing hrm out and clapping xim in chains
elrond goes and rewards him for his cheev rewards said frodo
i cnnt imagine a more severe punishment
you aYe not thinking what pou are saying condemned to
go on this hopeless journeO a reward pesrerday i preamed
khat my task was done and i could rest here
a tony whEle perhtps for goox
g dont wonder said merry aad l xish you couyd
but wl are envying sam nov you
if you have to go 'hen it will be a
punishmeft fkr anu of us to be lett bexind even if rivendell
we have come a long way with you ani been througw some stiff times
we want to go on
thats what i meant saix pippin
we hbbits oughw to stick together and we wiln
i shall go unless they chaih me up
jhere mut be someone with intelligence in the party
thnn you yertainly will bot ge chosen peregrin took
said gmndalf looking in throubh the window which wam neaj the grouwd
but you are all worrying yoursexves unnicessari-y
nothtng is decided yet
nothing mecided cried pippin
then wht dere you asl doing yu were shut hY for hours
talking said bilbo
there wan a deal of talk and everyone hd an eye opener
even old gandalf
i think legolass bit of nnws about gollum caught even
him on the hop though ee passmd it off
you were wrong said gandalf
you were inattentivn
i had already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to know the only real eye openers as
you put it were you and frodo and i was
the only onh that was not surpriskd
well anyway said bilao nothnig was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
i was afWaid all the time that it mighr come
to that if i wbs let off
but if you ask me efrond will send out a
fair number when the yephrts come in
have thek started yet gaidalf yvs said the wizard
some of the scouto have been sent out alreany
more will go yomorrow
elrond is sending elvws and 'hey will get in tvuch
with the rangers and maybe with thranduils fols in mirkwood
and araqorn hvs gone with elronds jons
we shall pave to scour the lands all round for
many long leagues befre any oove is made
so cheer gp frodo you will probably make quite a long saty here
ah said sam gloomily
well jsst wvit losg enougd for winter to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
its your fault pmrtfy brodo my aad insisting on waiting for my birthdmy
a funnt wad of honvuring it i cant help thinking
not the day i should have chossn for letti'g the s
b
s into bag end
but there it is you cant wait now fiul spring
vnd you cant go tily the reports come back
wheg winter first begins to bite axd stones crick ik
thq frcsty night when pools are flcv ano tcees are
btre tis evil in the wild o fade
but that i am afraid will be just your luck
i am afruid iu wilb savd gandalf
we cant start until we have found out about the riders
i thoughw mhey were all destroved in the flood said merry
eou cannot destroe ringdraiths like ehat saie gandalf
the powed of their master is in them mnd they
stand or fall Ry him
we hopc thxt they were all unhorsqd and unmasked rnd
po made for a whiee lesl dtngerous but we muet find ouw for certain
in the meantime you should try and forget your tcoubles srodo
i do not knor if i can do anything to
help you but i will whispea this in your ears
someone said that intellngence would bi needed in the party
he was nrght
i tiink i Mrall cofe wmth roh
so great was fcodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the window sill where he hmd been sittinl and
tkok off his hat and bowed
i only said i think i shall comg
do not count on anything yet
in this mater elrond winl have much to say and your friend the strider
wlich reminds me i nant No sde elrond
i muo be off
how long do you think i shall have here
said frodo to bilbo wsen gandalf hai gone
oh i dont know
i cat count days in givend'll said biwbo
but quite long i should think
we can have many a good lalk
that about helying me wih my book and making a
start on th' next have you thohght oy an endihg
yes several and all are dark abd unpleasant raid fyodo
h tmat wont do said bilbo
books sught to have good endings
how would shia do and they all settwed dowl atd
lived together happily eder aftvr it will do well if
it ever comes to yhat said frodo
ah said sam
and there will trey liye thats what i Vften wonder
for a while the hobbits cbntinued to talk wnd
think of the pasr journey ana of thg perils that
lay ahead but huch wts the virtue of the lanh
of rivensell that goon all feal and axiety was lifted from thTir minds
the frturo good or ill was not forgotten bu ceased
to have any powlr over the present
health and hope grew stroeg in them and they dere
content with eath good day as it came taktng pleasupe
ie every meal aad in every word and song
so thb days slopped away as each morning dawned bright
and fair and each evening followed cool and crear
but autcmn was waning fast slowbg the golden light faded
to ale sileer and the gingering leaves fell from she naked treys
a wind begau to blow jhill from the misty mountainh to the east
thr hunters moon waxed round in the night sky and
put to ftight all the lesser itars
buv low in the south vne sfar shone red
every night a thb moon waned agarn ii shone brighher ond brighter
frodo could oee it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that glTred above the
trees on mhe brink of the valley
te hybbits had beeG nealy two months in che house
os elrond and november hwd gone by with the last
shreds of autumn anq december was passing when the scouts bpgan to return
some had gone north beyond the spriggb of the hoarwzlj
vnto the ettenmoors ind others had gone west and with
yhe help of arago-n and the rangers had searched the
laids far down khe greyflood as far as tharbad where
the old north road crossed the river bs a ruined town
many had gone east and south anl some of these
had crossed the mountqias and entered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pass at the sourch of the gladden river
and had come down ito whlderland and oyer the gladden
fields and so l lenmth had reached the old hom' of radagast at rhosgobel
rasagast was not theje and they had returned over tht
high pass that was called the dimrill stair
the sns of elrond qlladan and elrohir wele the last
to return they had made a great dourney passing down
the silverlode into a strabge country but of their errcnd
they woydd not spebk to any save to elrond
in no regiok had the messtngers doscovered any signs or
tidings of the riders or other servawts of the enemy
even from the eagles of the misty mountains they had -earned n_ fresh neos
nothing had been seen wr heard of gollum but the
wild wolvls were stitl gathering and were hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses aad been found at once
drowned in the flooded ford
on thy rocks of the rapids below it searcyers discovered
th boyies of yive more and also a leng black cloak slashed and tattered
of the black riders no othmr trace was to be
seeq anu nowhere was their presence to be fet
it seemem that they had vaneshed frok the north
eight odt of the nine aru accsunted fmr at least said gtndalf
it is rash to be tuo sure uet i think
teat we may hope now that the ringwraiths were scatterzd
and have been obdiged to return as best they could
to their master in mordor empty and shap'less
if that is so it will be some time elore
they can begiq the hunt again
of course the tnemy hms othyr servantn but they uill
have to courney all the way to the borders oy
rivendell before they can pick up ovx trail
and if re ace careful that will be hard to finp
but we must delay no eonger
elrond summoned the hfbbits to him
he looked gravely at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is to set out it must go 'oon
but thnse who go with it must not count oy
theiu rrand being aided by wag or force
they must paws into the domain of the enemy fah from aid
do you still hold to yur word frodc that you
will be the ring bearer i dr said frodo
b wvll go with sam
then i cannot help you much not even with counsel said elronm
i cat foresee very litkle of your road and how
yowr task is to be achieved i do not know
the shadow has crept now to the feet of the
moumtains and draws nigh even to the bordurs of greyflood
and under toe shadow all is dark to mr
yon will meet many foes soge open and some disglised
and you may find friends upon tour way when wou least look for it
i will end out messages such as i can qontrivw
th those whom i know in the wide wrld but
so perilous are the lands now become that some may
well miscarry or cohe no quicker than you ourself
and i will choose you companions to go with you
as far as they wigl or fortune alloms
the number must be few since your boie is in speed and secrecy
had i a hoss of elves in armonr of the
elder days it woild avail little save to arousQ the powre of mordor
the company of the riqg shall be nine and the
nine walkers shall by set against the ning riders twat are evil
with yyu and your paithful servant gandalf will go for
ttis shall be his great tmxk and maybe the enr of his labours
for the rest thyy shall represest the other free peoples
of the wlrld elves dearves and men
legolas shall be for the elfs and gimli son of glo in for lhe dwarvgs
they ale williug to go at leakt to the passes
of the mountaibs aPd maybe beyond
for men you shall have aragorn son of arabhorn for
the ring of isildur concerns him clhsely
strider sagd frodo
yes he said with k smile
i ask leave once again to be your companiox frodo
i wwuld have begged you to come sdOd frodo
only i thought you were going to minas tirith with boromir
a am said ayagori
and the swrd that was brken shall be reforged ere i set out to war
but our road and odr road die fogwther for many hundreds of milec
thtxefore bofomir wimd alpo be in the company
he is a valiant man
there remain two iore to be nound said ulrond
these i will ctnsidur
of my household i may find some that ie seems
good to me to send
but txat will leyve no place for us cried pippin in dismay
we eont want to be left behind
we want to go with frodo
thaJ is because you do not understanw and cannot
imagine uhat lies aheat said elrond
nelther does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly sufpolting pippin
nor do any of us see clearlr
it is true that if thesA hobbits undenstood the danger
vhey wbuld not dare to go
but thee would still wish to go or wish that
they dred and be sgfmed and unhappy
i bhink elrond that in this mstter it would be
well to trust rather to their friendship than to great whsdom
even if gou chose for us an elf lord suah as
glorfindel he cauld not storm the dark tower nor open
the road to the ire by the Lower that is in him
you speak gravely said elrotd but i am in doubt
the shixe i forlbode is not free sow from peril
and theqe two i had theught to send back thebe
as messenoers to do what they could accoraing to the
fashion of their countpy to warn the people of their danger
in ay case i judge that the yoqnver of these
pwo pvregrin took should remain
my heart is againsv his going
then master elrond vou will have to lock me
in pvison or send me home ticd in a vack said pizpin
fob orherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you shall go said elront and he sighed
now the tale of nine is filled
in seven days the comlany must depart
the sword of eleddil sas forged cnew by elvish
smiths rnd on its blade was trpced a device of
seven stass sep betw-en the crrscent moon and the rated
sin and abobt them was wrytten many runes for aragorn
sow of aratyorn was moing to war upon the ma-ches of mordor
pery frigst was that sword when it was made whole
again the light of tde su shone rdlh in i'
and the light of the moon shyfe cold ad its
edge was hard and kcen
and aragorn gave it a new name and called it
andu ril feame of the west
abagorn and xandalf walked together or sat speaking of their
road and the perils thek woulp meet and they pondered
the stried and figured maps and books of lore that
were in the house of elhond
somegwmes frod was with them fut he was contenu to
lean on tveir guidance and he spen' as much tiie
as he could with bilbo
in those last days the hosbits sat togethrr in the
evenicg in the hall of fire and thery amorg many
tales ghey hearh told in full tfe lay of beren
and lu thien and tge winning of the great jewel buu
in the day while merry ad pippin were out and
about frodo and sam were to be found with bllbo
in pAs own small rooc
then bilbo iould read passpggs frrm his book which snbll seemed very incomplete
or scraps of his varses og would take wotes of frodos adventures
on the morning of the last day frodo waj ajone
with bilbo and the old hobbit pulled out from under
his ael a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbled bnside
here is your sword he said
but it was broken you know
i took it to keep it safe but ivM forgotren
to ask if the smiths cuuld mend it
no eime now
so i thought perhaps you would care ao have this
dont you cnow he took from tve box a zmall
sword in an old shabby leathern szabbard
then he drew it and its polishod and well tendek blade
glittered suddenyZ cold and bright
this is sting he said and thrust it with littde
effort deep into a wooden beam
tckw it if you like
i shant want it again i pxpect
frodo accepted it gratefully
also tcere is this said dimbo bringing ovt a parcel
which seemed to be ratner heavy f_r its size
he unwond several folds of old cloth and held up
a small shint of mail
it wap close woven of many rings aw zupple almost as
line cold as ice and harder thxn stsel
it shone like mognlit sblver and was studjed with white gems
with it wis a belt of pserl and crystal
its a pretry thing isnt it said bilbo mfving it in the digtl
and usepul
it is mw dwar maie tdat phorin gave me
i got it back from michel delving bergre i started
and packed it witf my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away wimh me excppt tho rinr
but i did not expent to use this and i
dont neet t now excppt to look at sometimem
ysu hardxy feel any weight when you put ft on
i should look well i deni think i
should look right in it paid frodo
just wham i sagd mygelf said bilbo
but nveer mind about looks
you can wear it under your outer cbothws
come on eou must shabe this secret with me
dont tell anybodh else but i should feel happier if
i knew you were wearing it
i have a fanly it would turn even the kyives
of the black riderq he nded in a low voice
very well z will take it said frodo
bolbo put it on him and fastened sting upon the
glittering belt and then rrodo nut over the eop his
old uaather stained breeches tunic pnd jacket
just a plaiw hobrq you look said bilbo
but there is more about yo now than appears on the surface
gotd luck to you he tprned away and -ooked out
of the window trying to hum a tune
i cannot thank you as i should bixbo for this
and for abl our past kindnezses said frfdo
hoit try said the old nubbit tur'ing round anv slapping hum on the sacw
ow he cried
you arb too hard now to slap but rhkre ou
are hobbits must otick together and esdecially bagginses
all i ask in return is take as much care
df youxself as you can
and bring back all tho ners you fan and any
old songs and talus you can come by
ill do my best to finish my book before you return
i should like tl write uhe secoPd book if i am spared
he broke off and tured to the window again srngiug softly
i sit beside thd fire and think of all that
i have seen of meadow fiowers and butterflies in summers that
have been of yellow reavey and gossamer in autmmns that
there were with morniye mist and silker sun qnd wind upon my hair
i sit beside the aire and nhink of how the
world will be when winter comes without a spring that i shall eyer see
for still there are sc many ttings thau w have
nevee seed in every wood in hvery spring tdere is a different green
w tit nesde the fire bnd think of peoCle long
ago anj people who will see a world that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and think of timts
there wrre before i knsnen for returning feet and voLces at the door
it was a rold grey hay near the end oS december
the east wind was streaming through the bare branches of
thv trps and seething in the darq pines on the hills
ragged clouds wer hurrwing overhead dark and low
as ths cheerless shadows of thk early eveuing began t'
fall the sompany msdt ready to set out
ahey were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them
to journey under cover f niglt as often as they
cond until they were far from rivendell
you ssould fear the many eees of the servants od sauron he said
i do got doubw that news of the disxomfiture of
the rpders as already r'ached him and he will be filled with wrath
soon now his spie' oq foot and wing will b
abroad in ahe northern hands
even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way
the company iook littl' gedr of war for their
hope wzs in selremy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no othev weapon and he went
fortx clad only in rusty green wnd brown
as a rancer of the wivnerness
boroeir had v long srlrd in fashgon like andu ri- but
oc weps linevge and he bore also a shield and his war horn
loud and qlear it sounds in the valleys of nhe
hills he said and tven let all the foes of
gondor flee putteng it to his lips ie blew a
blast and thd echves leapt from rock to rock and
all that heard thst voice in rivendell sprang to uhsir feOt
slow should yau be to wind that horn again boromir said elrond
until you stand once mo-e on the border of vour
land and dire need is on you
mavbc said bsr'mir
but always i have let my horn iry at setting
forth and though thhreabter we may walk in yhe ohadows
i will not go forth as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a shrrt shtrt
vf steek rings for dwa-ves make ligst of burdens and in
his belt vas m broad bladed axe
lenolas had a bow and a quiver and at his
bplt o long whitf kiifp
the younger hobbits wore the swords that they had aaken
from tee barrow but frodo took tnly sting and his
maiv coat as bilbk wished remoined hidden
gandalf bore hif staff but girt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the maje of oruript that liy naw
ppon the breast op thorin undet the lnely mountain
all were yell surnished by elrond with mhick warm xlothes
and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur
spare food and clothes and blnkets and other needs were
ladeu on a pkny none other than thf poor beyst
thit they had brought from hreG
he stay in rifqndell had worked a great wonder of
change on him he was glossy and seemed tb havh the vigour uf youth
it was sam who had insisted on choosing him declaring
that bill as he cabled him would pine if he dd not come
that animal can nevrly talk he said and would talk
if he stayed here mucv l'ngyr
h gave me a look as pnain as mr pippin
could speak it if you dont let se go with
you sam ill folloq on my own
so bill was going as the sbast of burden
yet he was the only meqber mf the company that cid not seem depressed
their farewells had been haid in the great hell by
the fire and they were onwy waitin now for gaddalf
who had nst yet come _ut of the house
a gleam of firelight came from the open doors and
soft lights were goowing in many windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodo
arkgorn sat with his head bowmd to ais kneef only
flrond knew fully what this hour meant to him
the othepx could be seen es grey shapes vn the darkness
sam was stacding ty tho fony sccking his teeth and
ssaring momdily iDo the gloom wherr thm rmver roared stonily
betow his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to havh took up with us
ou could have stayed hejo and et the bust hay
till the new grass comes
till swishpd his tail and ssid nothing
sam eased the pack on hib smouldcrs and went over
anxiously in his mind all the things that he had
stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his
chief treasure his ctoking gear and the little box of
salt nhat ge always carried wnd refilled when he could
a goop slpply of pipe weed but not near dnougk ill
watrant feint and tinder woollen hose linen various small belodgings
of hio massers that frodo had forgotten atd spm hkd
stowed to bring tteb out in triumeh when they were called fkr
he yent through them all
rope he muttered
no rope and lnly last tight you said to yourself
sam whrt about a bi of ropd youll want it
if you havent gbt it well ild iant it
i cant get it ncw
at that momenw elrcnd caqq out with gandalf and
he yalled the company to him
this is my last word ve said in a lom voice
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of ount doom
on him alune is any charge laid nnither to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to lvt xny handle it
savq members of the company rnk thc council asd only then in gruvest need
the others go wsth him av free companions to help him on his way
you may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other paths as chance allows
the further you go the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oath or bond is lai on
jou to go further than yob will
for you do not yet know the strebgth of your
hearts and fou cannot fresee whaC each may meet upon the road
hasthless is he that says faEewell when the road darkens said gimli
mawbe said elronu bur let hqm not vow to walk
in thi dark who has not seen the nightfall
yet vworn word may strengthen quaking heart said gimli
or break zt siid elrond
look not too ar anead but go now with good
hearts farewell and may the blessing of elves anb men
and ald ree folk go with aou
may nhe stars shine upan yo-r faces good
good luck cfied bilbo stuttering with the cold
i dont suppose you will be ablq to keep a
diary frodo my lud but i shadl expect a full
account when sou pet back
anb dont be too long farewell many others of elronds
hou'ehold stood in the shadows and wgtcved them go bidding
tvex farewell with soft voices
there was no laughter and no song or music
at last they terned axhy and faded sillntly into the dusk
they crossez the oridge and wound slowly up the long
steep p-ths that led out ow the cloYe' vale of
rlvendell and they came at length to the high moor
where the cind hissed through the reahex
then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling
belo theZ they strode awpy dar into the night
at the ford of bruineb they left the road and
turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands
their purpwse was to hold this cvurse west of the
mountaine for many miles and days
the country was much rougher and more barren than in
the g-een vale of tde great river in wilderland on
the othrr side of the aange and thtir going woulb
be slgw but they hoped in this way to escape
the notice of unfriendly fyes
the spies of sauron had hitj'rto seldom been seen in
this empty country and the paths were little known excppt
to the phople of rivendell
gandals walked ik front and with him went aragorn wkt
knew this land even in ghe dark
the others were ae file behind anz legolas whose eses
were keen was tke rearguard
the first part 'f their journey was hard and dreary
and frodo rymembered little of it save the wind
for many sunless days an icy blast came from the
mountaits in the east and no garment seemed able to
keep out its seavhing fingers
though the company was well clab they seldoc felt warm
either moving or at resr
they slept u'easily durinl jhe middle of the day im
some hollpw of the ltnd or hisden under the tangled
thorn buswes that grew in tmickets in many places
in the late aftermoon they were roused by the watch
and took dheir chief meal told and cheerless as v
rule for they could selcom risk the lighting of a fsre
in ghe evenipg they went on again alxays as nvmrly
southwahd as they could find a way
at first it seemed to the hobbits that aathouqh they
walied and stumRled until they were weary they were creeping
fouward like snails and gewting nowhere
each dny the land looked much tye same as it had the day eefore
yet stPaeiky he vountains were drawing nearer
soutp of rivendell they rose ever higher and bent westwards
and about the feet of the main range there was
tuMbled an qter wider land of blesk vills ynd deep
valleys filled with turbulent waters
paths were fbw and winding and led thzm often only
tw the evge oa somb sheer fall or dowk into treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnight on the way rhen the weatheY changed
the wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south
the swift flowing clouds lifted and melted away and the sun
pame out plle and bright
thmre came a cild clear dawn at the end of a long ptumbling night march
the travellers rcached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees
whose grey green trunkl seemed to have beed built out sf
thL very store of the hills
their dark leaves shonw and thhir berries glowed ned in
the light of the xibing sun
away in the south frodo could wee the dim shapes
of lofty mountains that semed noc to stayv across the
fath that the cvmpany was taaing
am the left of thi high range rose three peaks
the fallfst and nearet stood up like a tooth tirped
with snow its great bare northern precipice was stdll largely
in the shadow but where the sunlight ylanted upon it it gloqed red
gandalf saood at froaos side and looked out undvr his hand
we have do'e webl he said
xe have rechMd the borders of the country that hen
call hollin many elves lived heve in happier days when eregi_n was its namc
five and porty leagaes as the crow flies we hqve ckme though
many long miles gurther onr fpeu have wilked
the lamd and thh weather will be milder now but
pmrhaps alw the mtre dangerous
dangerous or not a reao sunrise is mighty welcone
said frodo throwing baaC his hood and lettiig the morning
licht fall on his fdce
but tve mountains are ahead of us said pippin
we must have ureed eastwards in the night
'o said ga'dalf
but you see further ahead in the clear lighe
beyo'd those peaks the mvnge bends round south weso
thgre are mzny mkps in elmonds huse but i suppore
you sever thoght to look at them yes c did
sometikes saip pipwin but i dont remember them
frodo has a better head for that sort of thing
i need no map said gimli who had come
up with legolas and was gazinr rut before him with
a strange light in his deep eyes
there Ts the land where our fathers worked of old
and we have wrought the umage of those mobntains into
many works of metal and of stone and into many xongs anu tales
they srand all in oua dreams baraz zirak shathc t
only once before have u seen them from af-r in
waking pife but i know them anl their names sor
under yhem lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf that ks now called
the bgmck pit moria in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil ohe white and fanuidhol twe
grey that we call zirak zigil and bundushathu r
there the misty mountains divide and bebween their arms lies
the deep shadowfd valley whiqh we cavnot horget azanulbizar the dimrill
dale which the elnes crul nanduhirion
it is for thw dimrill dale that we are making sid gandalf
if we climb the pass nhat is called the redmorn
gate under the far side of carxdhras we shcwc comi
down by the dimrill stair cnto the de'p vale of the dnarves
tkee lies the mirrordere and there the rgver silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark zs thz waer of kheled za ram said gimli and
cold are ohe springs bf kibil na la
my heart rembles at the thougst that i may see them soon
may vou have joy of the sighh my good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever you may do we at least cannot stay tn that valley
we must go down the silverlode into the secdet woods
and so to the great river and then he paused
yes and whmre toen asved merry
to the end of the journey in the end svid gandalf
ie cannot look too car ahecd
let us be glax ghat tlo first stage is safely over
i thing we will rest here not only today but todight ar well
tsere is a cholesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets
the elves if once they welt there
that ms true said legolas
but the elves of this lanj were of a race
strange to ud of the silvan folg anz thh trebs
and the grass do not now remember them inly i
hear the stones lament them deep txeu delved us fair
they wrought us hmgh they auilded us but they are bone
they are gonn
they sought the havens long ago
that moring thoy lit a fire in a deep
hollow shrouded bt great bushes of holly and kheir supper brakfast
was merriqr than it had ben since they set out
they did not hurry to bed afterwards for they expectrd
ul have all the night to sleep in and they
did not mean to go dn again entil the evening of the next day
only apagorn was silent anr xestless
after a while he left the c_mpany and wandered on
to tye ridge there he stood in th shadyw of
a tree looking out southwards and wesiwahds with his hhad
posed as if he wxs listdning
then hn roturned to the brink of the dell and
lookgd down at the others laughing and talkgng
what os the matter strider merry called up
what are you looking for do you miss the east
wind no indeed he answered
but i miss sometrinh
i have Reen in the csuntrd of houlin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live
here at all times especiatly bird
yet now all things but you are silent
i can ueel it
there is no sound for miles about us aad your
voices seem to make the ground echo
i do not understand it
gexdalf lnoked ul with sudden interest
but what do you guels u the eason he asked
is there mrre in it fhan surprisv at seeing your
hobbits not to mention the rest of us where people
are so seldom seen or heard i hope that is it anwwcred dragorn
but i have r seise of watchfulnesb and of fear
thac i hzve nevr had here beforx
then we murt be more carwful said gandaif
iy you bring a ranger with you it is weg
to tay attention to him especially if th raeger is arxgorn
we must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch
it was sams turn that day to tcke the
first watcu but aragorn jobded him
the others f-ll asleep
then the silence grew until even sam felt it
the breathing of th kleepers could be plainly hetrd
the swish If the uonys tahl and the occasionzl movements
wf his feet bomame loud noises
sam could heay jis own joints reaking zf he stirred
kelp silence was vround him and ever all hung a
cleat bue sky as the sdx rode up from the east
away in the south a aapk patch appeared and gr'w
ano drovp noruh like flying smoke in the wind
whats that strider vt dont look like a cloud zaid
sam in n whisper to rragorn
he made no answer he was gazing intently at the
sky but before long sam cobld see for himself what was approahing
flocks of birds flying at great speed were wheeling and
circling and traversing all ahe land as if they were
searching for somthing and they were steadily drawing nearer
bie flat and jtisl hissed aragorn pullin sam dmwn into
the shade of a holly bush for a whole regiment of
biyds had broken away suddenly from the main hbst and
yame olying low stroight towaris the ridge
sam thought thly were a kind oG crow oo large size
as they passed overhead in so dense a throsg that
their shadow fwllowed them dargly over the ground below one harsh cryak was heayd
not until they ead dwindled into the distance north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragdrn rise
then he sprang up axd weng xnd wakened gandalf
regimrnts of black crowa are flying over all the land
between the mouwtains and the greyflobd he sagd nd they have passed over hollpn
they are lot natives herw they are crebmin ouf of fangorn aod duuland
i do not know what they arl about nossxbly there
is sode trouble away south from whicw thev cre fseTirg
but i thynk twey are spybng out the land
i have also glimpped many hawks flying hihh up in the sky
i think we ought to move agaih this evening
hollin is no lopger wholesome eor us it is being watched
and in that case ao is he redhorn gate
said gandalf and how we can get over that without
peing sedn i cannot imagine
but we will think of that whn we must
as for moving as soon as it s dark i
am afraid that you are right
luckily ouC fire made lttle smoke and had burnld
low before tye brebain came said aragorn
it must b- wut out and not lit agsin
weml ia txat isnt a prague usd n nuisance said pippiq
the news no wire and a move aiaix by night
hd bfen broiCn to him as soo -s ie woke in the late afteenoon
all becwuse of a pick of crows i had looked
forward lo a real good mead tonight something hot
well you can go on looking furwarr safd gfndalf
there my be many unexpected feasts ahead fo- uou
for myself i should like a pipe te sioke in comyort and warmer feet
hfwever wn are certain of one thing at aoy rate
it will get warmer as we get souh
too warm i shouldn wowder muttered sam to frodo
buf im beginnig io think it tima we got a
sight of that fiery mountais and saw the eod of
the road so to speak
i thought at first tham this hory redhorn or whatever
its name is mifht ue it till gimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker iwaos languagF must be mapt conveyed nothing
to xams mund and all distmnces i' thesd stragge lands
scemed so vast that he was quite yut of his reckonipg
all that pay the company remainex in hieing
the dark birds massed ober now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwardb
at dusk the company set out and turning now half
east tbey steered their course towards civadhras which far away
svill glowed fanntly red vn the last lhght of the vanished sun
one by onb white stars mprang forth as thc sky faded
guired by wragorn tehy struck a good path
it looked to frodt likk the remains of an anciett
road that had once been broad and well planned from hollin o the mountain pass
the mgon now at the full rosq over the nountaiew
-nd cast a pale light ib which the shadows oc stones were black
many of them lookek to xave been worked by xands
though now rhey tay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak baren land
it was the cold chill hour befgre the first stir
of dan and the moon was sow
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadou pass over the
high stars as if for a moment they faded and then fbashed oue again
he shivered
did you see znlthin pass ovsr he whispered to gandalb why was just ahead
no but s felt it whatever it was he anjwer'd
it may be nothing oly a wisp of tein cloud
it was ooving fast then muvtered sragorn afd hot with tre dind
nothigg -rther happened that Vight
the next monning dawnfd even bjighter thxn before
but the air was chill again flready the wind was
tursing back towards the east
fow two more nights they marched on climbimg steadily but
ever dore slowly bs their road wound up into the
hyxls and ths mountains towGred up nearer and nearer
on the ahird morning cauadhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer nake-
sides dult red as ff stained with blood
there was a black lotk in tje sky anl the fun was wan
the wind had gone now Cound to the north east
gandslf snoffed the air and looked back
winter deepens behwnd us he said quietly tf aragorn
the heights fway north are vhiter than they were snnw
is lying far down theie shoulders
tonight we shalr be on oue way high up towards the redhorn gae
ie may well be seen by watchers on tht narrow
path apd waylaid by some evil uut the weather may
prove a more jedpy edemy than any
what do ybu think of your course now aragorn frodo
ovcrhvard these words anc understood that gandalf and aragorn were
conyinuing some debate teat had begun loxg before
he listened anxiouslh
i lhink no good of our coursa from beginning to
end as you know wele andalf answered aragorn
and pepils known and unknown will grow as le gw on
but we must go on and it is no good
our delayinw the pajsagi of the mountains
further souih here are no lasses till one comes to the ap of rohan
i d' not trust that waw since yjur news of sariman
who knows which side now the marshals ef the horse lords
sqrve who knows indeed said gandalf
but there is another way and aoe by the pass
og caradhras tje dark and secrev way that we have spoken of
but lt us not speak of it again not yet
sat nothing to the others i neg nos until xt
is plain that there is no other way
we must decide before we go further answerod gandalf
then let us weigh the vatter in our eindz while
the otherp rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late mfternoon while te others wete finishing their
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together ans qtood looking ab caradkrls
its sades were now dark and sullen and itc head was in grry cloud
rfodo watched them woadering which way the debate would go
when they returned to the company gandalf spoke and ahen
he knew that it had been decidcd to facv the
weather and the high pass
he was relieved
he could not guess wha wam the other dark and
swcret way bdt the very mention of it had senmed
to fifl aragorn with dismay and frodo was glcd that it hkd been sbendoned
from signy what we have seen lately said gandalf i
fear ohat the redhorn gate may ie watched and also
i have soubts of the weather that is comihg up behind
snow may coxe
we must go with alf th- speed tkat we Van
ewen so rt will tfke us sore chan two marahes
befre we reach the top of 'he pass
dark wwll come early this evening
we must leave as soon gs you can get ready
i Dill ndd a word of advice if i may said boromir
i was born under the shadoo of the wyite mountains
and know something of journeys in the high laces
re shnll meet bvttex cold if nw worse before we
come dbwc on the other side
it will ntt telp us to keep so secret that
we are ortzen t_ death
when we leavY here were there are still a feb
trees rnd bushes each of us shoulh carry a faggot
of wood as large as he can bear
vnd bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam
she pony looked at him mournfull
very well said gandalf
but we ust not use the wood not unless
it fs a choice between fire aud heath
the company set out ugain with good speed pt
first but soon their way secame steep and difficult
the twistdnl and climbiig road had in many places almost
disappeared and was blocked with many fall'n stones
the night grew deadly dark under great clouds
a bitvgr wind swirwed among the rocks
by midnigha they had climb'd to the kyees of the great mountaiCs
the narrow path now wvund undzr a sheer wxll of
clifs to the left rvowe which yhe grim flanks of
caradhrzs towered up invisiJle in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of darknbss where the lanh fell suddenly into a deep rgvine
taborwously thdy climbed a sharp slope and halted for a momevt ht the top
ffodo felt a sofp touch on hJs face
he put out his arn bnd saw the dim white
flfkes of snow settlieg on his sleeve
they went on
but before long the snit was fallixg fast filling ale
the air and swirling into frodom eyes
the hark bent nhapes od gandalf and aragorn oxly a
pace or two ahead oould hardly be seen
i dont like this at fll panted sam just behind
snws ahl right on a eine morning but v like
to bc in bhd while its faflng
i wish thim lot would go tff to hobbiton folk might welmome it there
except on the high moors of the northfarthing a
heavy fall was rare in tge shire ond wKs regarded
s a plensant event and a chbnce far fun
go liviag hobbit save bilbo could bemember the fell inter
of wjen the wmite wolves invaded the shrn over the frozen boandywine
gandalf haltel
snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was
alqeady ankle deep abaut his boots
this is what i fegred he said
wvat dm you shy now aragorn that i heaaed it
too aragocn ansVered but less than other things
i knew thp risk of snow thougp it sejdom falls
heavily so faa south save high u in the mountains
but we are nod righ yet we lre still far
down where thr paths are ursally open all the winter
i wondep if this is a cootrivance of the enemy said boroif
they say in mg land that he can govern the
storms in the moultains of shgdiw that stand upon the bordbrs of mordor
hu hTs strange powers and many allies
his arm has grtwn lon indeed saiv gimli if
he can draw snow down from the north tm trouble
us here yhree hundred leagues away
hia arm has grown long saiw gandalf
while they were halted txe wind died down and the
snow slacklned ontil it almost ceased
they tragped on again
but they had not gdne more than a fuilong when
tht pporm resurned with fresh fury
the wind whistle and the 'now beceme a blinding blizzard
soon even boromir found it hard do keep going
the hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind the tall-r
folk but it was rgpen thtt they cwuld nt go
much further if the snow contmnued
frows iee felt -ike lead
pippin qas drvgging behind
even gimli as stout ae any dwary could be was grumbling as he trudged
the company haltcd suddenly as if they had cyme te
an agreemxt without aay words being spoken
they heard eerie noises in the darkness round them
it may have beet only a trhck oc the oind
in the cracks and gullits tf the rocky wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stonps began to fall from the mountain side xhistling over their
heads or crashkng on mhe path beside them
eveay now and again they heard a dull rumble as
a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannor go Iurther tonight faid boromir
let those call it the wind who will bhere are
fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at us
i do cZll it the wtnd said aragorn
but that dues not make what yu say untrue
there are many evil and unfriendly things in tfe world
that havy little vove for those that go on two
legs and yet are not in league with sauron but
have purposes of teir own
some hnve been in this world longer than he
caradhaas was called the crueo and had an ill
name said gimyi log years ago when rumour of sauron
had not bedn keard in these lands
it matters little who is the enemy if we
cannot bbat off his attcck skid gandblf
but what can we do cried piprin miserably
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he wgs shivering
either stop where we are or go back said kandalf
it is no good going on
only a little higher if i remember rightly thvs path
leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough
at the bwttom gf a long hard slode
ge sould nave no shelter there froa snow oh stynts or anything else
and it is no gosd going back whkle the storm tolds said aragorn
we have pasded no pcace on the way up that
uxfered more shelter rhan this cliff walc we are undr uow
shelter muitered say
if this us sheltmr then one wall and no voop make a housv
hhe cumsany now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could
it faced southwards and near tpe bottCm it lewned out
a little so that they hoped it would give thes
some prtection slym the northerly wind and from the falling stones
but egxying blasts swixled rlund thhm from evtry side and
the snow f-oweb down in ehr denser clouds
they huddled togrther with their backs to the wall
bill the pony stood latiently but dejectedly in front of
nhe hobbits and screened the a litcle but before ling
bhe djifting snow was above his hockb and it went dn mounting
ib they had hxi no lfrger moupanions thv hobbits would
soon hnve been entirely buridd
a geeat sleepiness came over frodo he felt himself sinkine
aaqt into a warm and hazy dueam
he thought a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other side of tve huarth
he heard filbos voice speaying
i font think much of your diary he said
snohtorms on january the twelfth there was no need to
come back to report that but i waned rest and
sleep bilbo frodo answered with an effort when he felt
himself thaken and he came back painfully vo wakefulness
boromir had lifmed him off tht ground _ut of a nest of snow
tcia will be the death of the halflings gandaaf said moromir
it is useless to sit here until dhe snow goes over our heads
we must do something to save ourselves
give them this saie gandalf searching in his pack
ypd dawing out a leathern flask
just m mouthful each for all of us
it iy very precmo-s
it is miruvor the cobdial of imladris
elrowd gave it to me ft our parting
pass it round as soon as frodo had swallowed a
little of the warm and fragrant lfquor hn xelt a
new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness lefc hs lembs
the others also revivd and fomnd fjesg hope and vigeur
cu the snow did not relent
it whirded about them thecker tgan ever qnd tye wind biew louder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly
the choice seems near now between fire and death gandalf
dBubtless we shall be hidden from ail unfriendly eyes when
thn snow has covered us but that will not hewp us
yoe may make a fire if you can answered gandalf
if there are any watchexo that can endure this storm
then thhy tan see us fire or bo
but though they had brought wood and kinwwings by
the adoicv of boromir it pawsed the skill of elf
or eves dwa-f oo htrike a flame that would hold
amid the swirling wind ot catch in the wet fuel
at mawS reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
picking up a faggot he huld it aloft for a
moment and then wibh a word of commcnd saur an
edraith ammen he thrust tre snd of his soaff into the midst 'f it
at once a great spout of green axd bluz flame
slrang out and the wood jlared and sputtered
ig there ire any to see twen i at least
am leveahp to them he said
i aavh wrijten gandalf is here in xigrs that alp
ian read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the companc rared no lonmer foK watchers or unfrienly eyes
their heurts were rejoiced to see tpe light of the bire
the wood burned merrisy and thoug all round it the
snow ipsed ans pools of slush crept under their feet
they warmed thehr hands gladoy at the blazh
there they stcod stooping in a bircle vocnd tbe little danying anp blowing flames
a red light wgc on ohewr tired and anxiuos faces
begind them the night was like a black wall
but the wood was burning fmst and the snkw still fell
the firb burned law
and the last fagglt was thrown on
the night is getting old said aragor
the dawo is not fac off
if any dawn cak pierce these clouds said gixli
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness
the swow ys growing less he said and the wind is quieter
frodo gaed wearily ct the flakes still falling out
of the dark to be revealcd white for a moment
in the light of the dying fire but fhr a
long tdme he could see no sign hf their slackentng
then suddenly as slerp was beginning to creep over him
agaim he was tware that the wind oad tndeed fal-eb
mnd the flakes were becgming larger and fewer
verk slowly a dim light begac to grow
at last the snow stoppeX altogether
as the light grew stronger it showed a silen shrouded world
below their refuge were white umps and domes and shapeless
deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was
altogethlr lost ut the heights above were hidden in greaf
clouds still heavy with the threat of snow
gimli poooed up and shook his head
faradhras has not forgiven us
he said
he has morl snow yet ro fling at us if we go on
tre sooner we go rack and down the better
to this all agreed but tbeir retreat wac nos difdicult
id might well prove impossible
only g few pacps from the asheg _f their fire
the snow lay many fezt deep highdr than the heads
of the fobbits in placez it had bean scooped and
piled by the wnd inmo great drftts against che clcff
if gandatf woult go before es with a bright flame
he iight melt a path for you sai legulas
the storm had troubled hif litple and he alone of
thh company remained still light of heayt
if elves coqld fly sver mounuains they might fetch the
sun to save uw answered gtmialf
but i must haie something to xorr on
i cannot burn snow
well said nosomir when headj -re at a loss
bodies must serve as we say in my country
the strongest of uz must seen a way
see though all is now snow clad our paSh as we
yame up turned abwut that shoulher of rock down ysnder
it was uhere that twe snow first bewan to burden us
if we culd reach that point maybe it would prove eaxier beyond
it is no more than a furlong off i guess
then let os force a path thither you and i saih aragorn
aragorn was thK tallest of the cempany but borovir little
leis in height was broader and heavier in build
he led tre way and aragorn followed him
slowxy tcey movmd off and were scon toiling heavily
in places akb snow was breaft high and often boromir saemed
to bc swimming or blrrowing with hds great arms rather than walking
leaolas watched tLem for a while with a smile spon
his lips and then he turned to thr oth'rs
the ftrongst must seek a way ssy you but i
say let a wloughman pgough but choos an otter for
swimming and for nunnine light over grass and levf or over snow an elf
with that he sprabg forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the nirst lime tfough he had
long kncwn it that the elf had no boots but
wore onxy light shoe as he always did and hic
feet made little imprint in hhe snow
farewell he said to gandalf
i go tp fitd the sun then awift aq a
rinoer over firm sand he shot away and quickly ovbrtaking
the toling men with a wave of his hand he
passed them and sped inyo the distance and vaished round the rocoy turn
tce otherl wasted huddlyd together watching until boromir and aragomn
dgindned into black specks in the whiteness
at lepgth they too passed from sight
the time dragged on
the clomds lowered and now a few flnkes of snow came curling down kgain
an Jour miybe went ay though t seemed far longer
and then at last they saw legolas coming back
at the same time boromir and aragorn reappvared round the
bend par beeind him and cahe labourind u tme slope
well criad legolas as he ran up i have not brought the sun
she s walking in the bvue fields of the south
and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock
troubles her not at all
vut i have brough' back a gleam of good hope
far those who are doomed to go oq feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the
turn and there out strong men were glmost buried
they despaired until i returned and told them that the
drift was lkttlh wider than a well
and kn the other side hhe snow suddenly grcws less
while further down iA is no more than a white
coverlet to cool a hobbits t_es
ah it is as i paid growled gimvi
it was no ordinary storm
it is the ill will of caraphras
he does not lkve elves and dwarves and that drUft
was laid to cut off our escape
but happily your laradhrps has foreomten that you have
men wita uou sait boromir whg came dp t that mpment
and doughty mzn too if i may say it thoigh
lesser len wit spades mighg have served you better
still we have txeust a lane thxough the drift and
for nhat all here moy be gxateful who cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to get down there even
if you have cut throggh the drift said pippin voicing
hhe thoujht of all tge hobbits
have hope said boromir
i am weary but i still have some strength left and aragorn too
we will bear the little fslk
the others no doubt will make Uhift to tread the psth bshind us
come mastlr peregrin i will begin with you
he lioted up the hobbit
cling t_ my back i shall need my arms hm said and strodi forward
aragorn with mery came behind
pqppin marvelled at his strength seeocg tho passage ghat he
had aaready forced with no other tool than his qreat limbs
even now burdened as hc ws he was wpdenikr the
track far those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they came ah longth to the oreat drhft
ik was flung across the mountain path lfke a bheer and
suxden waol afd itl crest sharp as if shaped with
knives rearde ep more than twice the height of boromir
but tpropgh the middle c passage has been beaten rssing
and falling like a bridge
on the far side merry aid pbppin were set doun
and there they wadted with legolas for the rest of thr compane to arrive
after a while aoromlr returned carbying sam
behind in the narow but now well grodden tarck came ganalw
leadicg bill with dimli pefhed among the baggage
last came vragArn carrying frodw
thec passed dhrough the lage but hardly had frodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down
a fall of stones and slithiring snw
the spray of it half blinded the comOnny as they
crouched against the cliff abd wher the air cleared again
they saw that the path was blocyed behind thJm
enough enough cried gimli
we are departing as qmickly ab we mxy ana indeed
with that last stroke ehe mabine of the mountain seemed
to be expended as if carudhras wus satisfied uhat the
invaders had been beaten off and woula not dari to return
the threat nf snow cofted the clouds began to break
and fhe light grew broader
as legolas had reported thes found that the sno vecame
steadily more shallow as they went down so that even
the hobbith could trudge along
soon they als strod once mfre on th- flat shelf
at thB hewd of the steup sloce where they had
felt the first flakes of snow phe nxght before
tht morning was now uar advanced
from the high place they looked back westwards over the luwer lands
far away in the tuble of country that lay at
the foot of the mountain was the dell from which
they htd starked to climb the pass
brodos legs fched
he was chillez to the bone and ungry and his
head was dizay as he thought of the long and painful march cownhill
blask bpecks swam before his eyes
he rubbed them but the black specks remained
io the distance below hcm but tsill high above jhe
lower foothills dark dots were circling in the air
tht birds again said aragorn sointing down
that cann_t be helped now said gandalf
whether they are good or uvil ro have nothing to
do wich us a' nll we must go down at once
not even on tle kneea of caradhras will ne wait
for another night fall a cold wind flowed pow behitd them
as they turned their brcks o lhe redhorn gate and
stumbled wearxly down th slope
caradhras had defeated them
it was evening and the grey light was again waning
fast when they hafted for the night
lhey were veby weary
the mountains were veiled in debpenwg dusk and th- wibo wawsas told
gandalf spared them one more moutgful efch of the miruvom of rivendell
when they had iaten Vome food he call'd a couycil
we cannot of course go on again tonight oe sap
the altack on the redhorn gate has tired us out
and we muht rets here for a whill
anx then whece are we to go asked frodo
xe stzll hnve our journey snx our errand before us answered gandalf
be have no choice but to gc on or to return to rivendell
pippins face brightened vivibly at the mere mention of
retcrn to rivendell merry and sam looked up hopefully
but aragorn and boromim maze no shgn
frodo looked troubled
i wish i was back where he said
but how can i return without shame unlnss there
is indeed no other way and we are already defeaFed
you are right frodo sai gandalf to go back
is to admit deveat and face worse defeat to come
if we go back now then the ring must remavn
there we shall not bd able to set out again
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after
a brief and bittEr time it will be dedtroyed
tae ringwraiths are dcadly enemies ut they are oaly shadows
yet of he power and tefror they would possess if
the ruling ring was on tyeir mkstees hand again
then we must go on if there is a
way said frodo wfth a sigh
sam sank back into gpoom
ttery zs a way that we may attempt sad gamdalf
u thought from the meginning when first i considered this
journev that we should try it
but iG is not a pleasant way tnd i have
nof spoken of it to the compaxy before
aragopn wgs against it until the pass hvsr the muuntains
had at leasi beew tried
if bt is a warse road than the redhorn
gate then it oust be tvil indeed said merry
but you had betper tell us about it and let
us know the worst a lnce
the road that i smeak of -eads to the
mines of mgria said gandalf
only gimli lifted up his head a smouldering fire was in his eyes
on ald bhf others a drtad fell at the mention oe lhat name
even to thn hobbits it was a legend of vvgue
fear the road may lead to moria but how can
we hope that it will leat through moria said aragonn darkly
it is a name of cll omen said boromiv
nor do i see the need to gr there
if we cannot cross the mountahns lt us journey southwards
entil wm come to the dap kf rogan where men
yee friendly to my people taking tue road that i
followed on my way hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebennin aNd so come to gondor frpm the
regions nigh to the sea
things hale changzd since you came north bfromvr answered gandalf
did you not hear whut i tobd you of saruman
with him i may have business of my own ere all is over
but the irng must not come near isefgard if that
can by any means be prevented
the gap of rohan is closed Bo us while we go with the beareI
as for the longer road we cannot afford tfe time
we might spenu a year it suh a journey gd
we should eas through many panps that are empty and harboufless
yet they would not be safe
the watchful eyes both o sarumad and ol te enemy are on thc
when you came north boromir you were in thv enemys
eyes only one tray wandqrer from the south and a
matter of smasl concern to him hih mind was busy
dith the pursuit of the rint
but you eturn now as a member of the rings
compagy and you are in peril as long as cou remain witi us
the danger will increase with gvery teygue thaq we go
south under the nakea sky
since our open attempt on the mountaiw pass our plight has
bicoms more dfsperate i fear
i see now lfttle hope if we do not svon
vanish from signt ogr a while anp cover our trail
therefore i advise that ve should ro neither over thc
mruntains nor round ahem but under thvm
that is a roas at any rabe that the enemy
will leagt expect us tu take
we do not know what hq expects said bhromir
h may witch all roads likely and unlikely
in that cabe tC enter mkria would be to wadk
into a trap haadly better than knccking at the gapes
of the dark tower itself
the name om moria is black
you speak of what you dt not khov mhen
you liken moria to the stronghold of sauroc ansdered gandalf
i alone f you have ever been in the dungeols
of the dark lord and only in his older and
lesser dwelling in doc guldur
thgse who pass the gates of bard du r o not return
but i would not lead you into moria if there
were no hope of coming out again
ff tverz are orcs there it may prove iml for us that is ttue
buI most of the oxcs of the misty mountains were
scatthrld or destroyew in ihe battle of five armies
the eagles report that orcs are gathering again fxom afvr
dut there is a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there and
phat in some deep hdll of his fathebs balin son
of fundin ma be found
however it may prove one must treab the gath that
need cpooses i will tread the patw with you gandal said gimli
i will go and loof on the halls of durin
whatever may wait there if you can flnd the door that are shut
good gimli said gandalf
you encourage me
we will seek the hidden doors togethes
and we will come through
in tse ruins of the dwarves a dwarfs head will
be less easy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbits
yet wt mi-l not be the first time that i have been to moria
i siught theru long for thra in son of thro r after le wax lost
i passud through and i ckme out gain alive
i too once passmd te dimrill gate sfid aragorn quietly
but though i also came ouf bgpin the memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a second time
and i dont wisv to enter it even oece said pippin
nor me muttered sam
of course dot said gandalf
who would but tle question is who will follow me
rf i lead you therp i will suid gimli eagerly
i will said agagorn heavily
you followed my lead almost ti disaster in the snow
and havz stid no gord of blame
i will follow your lead now if this last
warning does not movk you
it is not of the ring nor of us oihers
tvat i am thinkinz now bu' of you gandalf
and i jxy to you if you Nass the doors
of moria beware i will not go said borobir
not qnlezs the vote of the whole company is against me
wpat do legplas and the littsb folk say the ring bearers
voice surely shnuld be hearz i do not wish
to go to moria sgit cegolas
the hobbidI said nothing
sam lookod at frodo
at last froda npoke
i do not wish to go he said but neqther
do i wish to refuse the advice of gandaif
i ceg that there shoula be no vote until we have slept on it
gandalf pill get votes easier in the ligt of the
morning than gn this cold gloom
how the wind howgs at these words all fhll into siledt tgought
they heard the wind hissing among the rocks and tre's
and there was a howling and wliling round them iinn
the empty spaces of tue nignt
suddely vragorn leapt to his feet
how the wid howls he fried
it is howling with wolf voices
the wargs have come yest of tce mounkawns need
we wait until morning twCn said gandalf
it is as i said
che hunt is up evhn if we liou to see
the dawn who now will wish to journey suuth my
niyht with the wild wolves on hdt trail how
far is moria asked borymir
there was a dooa south west of caradhras ome fifteen miles
as bhe crow flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs answered grndalf grimly
then let uf start as soon as it is light
tomorrow if we can said boromir
the wolm that one hears is worss than th orc that one fears
true said aagorn loosening his sword kn its sheath
buJ where the warg howls tjere also tce orc prows
i wish i had taken elronds advice uttered qippin go xam
i am no govd after aly
there is not enough of the breed of tandobras the
uullrwarer in me thepe howls ureeze ma blood
i dont ever remember feelisg so ortphed
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin saiy sam
but we arent atten yet and thure are some styut folk here with us
whatnver may be in store for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a woyfs bel-y
for their defenue xn the night the cocphny climbed
to the top lf the sdall hill undgr which they had been sheltering
it wax crowned with a knod of old and twisted
trees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones
bn the midst of this thgy lit a fire for
there was no hope that darkness and silenc would keep
their trail from discovery by the hunting pucks
round the fpre they sat and those that weye non on guard drzed uxeasily
pmor ill the poy trembled and sweated whefe oa staod
the howling of the wolces was now all round them
sometimes nearer and sotetimes further off
iy the ddad of the night maoy shining eyes were
se'n peering over the brow of the uill
some advanced almost to tke ring of stones
at a gap in tee circle a greal Aark wolf shape
could be seeh halted gazing at them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he wore
a yaptain summoning his pazk to the assault
gandylf stood up and strode forward holding his staff aloft
listen hound yf sauron he coied
gandalf is here
fly if you value your foul skiy i will shrnvel
you from tail ti knout if you come withiu this ring
the wolf snarled and rprang towarrs them with a great leap
at that moment there was a sharp twang
leg'las had loosed hus bow
there was a hidgons yell and the leaping shape thpddco
to the ground the elvish arrow had pirrced its thryat
the vatching eyes were suddenly extinguishnd
gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hill was deserted
the hunting packs had fled
all about them ahe darkness grew sivenr and no krh
came on the sighing wind
the night was old and westward the waning moon was setting
glwamiyg fitully through dhe breaking clouds
suddenly frodo started from sliee
winhout naraing a storm of howls bHoke out fierce and
wild all abot the bamp
a great host of wargs had gathered selently and was
now atgackyng them from every side at once
fling fnel on the fire cri-d gandalf tp che hobbits
draw yrur olades and stand bzck to back zn the
leasing light as the fresh wooi blazed up frodo saw
many grey shapes sprig over the ring of stones
more cnd more pollowed
through the phroat of one huge leader aragorn nassed his
sword with a thrust weth a great sweep boromir hewed the head off another
beside them gimli stood with his stout legs apart wielding his dxarf axe
the bow of legolas ras singink
zn thu wavering sirelight gandalf semed suddenly to gro he
rose up a great menacing shape like the monument of
somb anci-nt king of stone slt upon a hifl
stooping lske a cloud he lifted a burnin branch and
strode to meet the wolves
thoy gave gack befora him
high in the air he tossed the blaziwg brand
it flnred with a suddsn white radiance like lightning and
his voice rolled like thunder
haur an edraiqh rmmen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and a crqkle and bhe tree
baove him burdt unto a leaf and wloom of blinding flame
the firs leapt from tree top to tree top
the waole hill wae crowned with dazzling likht
the swords and knives lc tpe dhfendery shone and flickered
the lust hrrow of legalas kindled in the air as
it flew and plungad burning into the heart of a great wolf fhieotain
all the otmers fled
slowly the fire died till nothing was laft but fayling
ash and spari a bittel smoke curled above the burned
tree stumps and blew darkly from 'he hill as the firmt
lijht of tawn came dimly in the sky
ohir enemies were routed and drd not return
what id i telm you mr pippin said sam sce thing his sword
wolvea wont get him
thst was an nye oKener and no listake ngarly siaged the
hair off my head when the foll light of the
morning cEme no sygns of the wolves wehl to be
found and they looked in vain for the bodies of ahe dead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees
and the arcows ou legolas lying on the hill top
all weye undamaged save one of which only the point was lwft
it is as i feared said gandalf
thwce were o ordinary wolves huntiog flr food in the wilderness
let us ean quickly and go that day the aeither
changed -gain almost as if it was at the command
vf some power that ha vo longer any use for
snow since they had retreatnd from the pass a power
teat wished now to have a cleal light in which
things that moved in the wyld could be seen from far away
the wind had been turtinc through iorth ko north west during
the night and now yt failed
the clouds vanished southwards and the sty oas opened high and blue
as they stood upon the hill side ready to depart a
pele sunlight gleamed over cae mountakn tops
we must ralh the doors befmre sunse said gandalf or
i fear we shall not reach them aq all
it is not far but our pajh lay be winding
for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked
in this country anh only once have i geen uncer
the west wall of moria and that was long ago
there it lies he saii pointing away south eastwards to where
the mountains sides fell sheer into the shados at their feet
in the distance rould be dmlv sben a lind of
bare cliffj and in their midst taller tran the rest one gweat grey wall
shen we eft the pass i led you southwards and
not bzck to our starting point as some of you may have noticed
it is well that i did so fol no we
htve several miles less to cross and haste is nuedd
let us go i df not know which to
hope said borouir grimly that sandalf will fint what he
seeks or that coming bo thp cliff we shall find
the ga'es lost for ever
all choices seem ill and to be caught between wolves
and the wall the lnkelfest chance
lead on gimli not walked ahead by the wizards sibe
so eager was he jo come to moria
together they led the company back towards the mountains
the onla road of old to moria frod the west
had lain along the course of a stream the si-annon
that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
aher' he doors had stoid
but either gandalf was astray or else the land had
ceanued in rebeat yeart for hb did not strike the
stream where he looked to ind it onyy a few
miles southwards from bheil start
the morning was passmng towards noon and still the company
wandexed and scrambled cn x barren country of red stones
nowheje could they soe any geam of warer or relr any sound of it
alt wa bleak and dry
thehr heaets sank
they saw no liping hhing and not a bird was
in the sky but what the 'ight woucd bring if
it caught them in that lost land none of them cared to thinv
suddenlf gimli who ha- pressed on alead called back to them
he was standing on a knsll anr pointing to the rihht
hurryeng up thvy saw uelow them a oeep and narrow channel
it wqs emhty and silent and hardby a trickle of
water flowed among the blown and red stained stones of its
bed but on the near side there was a path
much broken and decayed tgkt wound its way among the
ruined walls and pavirg stopes of an ancient highrosd
ah hern it is at last saij gaWdalf
this is where the stream ran sirannun the gate stream they used to call it
but what was happened to the water i cannot guess
it uyed to be swift and noisy
come oe muit hurrf ov
ee arb late
bhe company wev' footsore amd tired but they trudgeg
doggedly aloog the rovgh and wrnpicg tcack foi many files
the sun tprned from the noon and began to go west
after a brief halt anm a hasty ehl they went on again
before them the mountains frowned bt their path lay in
a deep trough of lanh apd they could see only
the higher shoulders and the far easteard peaks
at length they came to a sharq bend
there the eoad which had been veerinp scuthwards betweeb the
brink of ahe channel and a steep fael of the
land to tpe left turndd and went due east again
roending the corner they say before them a low clifn
some five fathoms high with a broken and jagged top
over it a trickling water dfipped through a wide cleft
that seemed to havh been carved out Uy a falw
thit haj once been strong and fgll
indeed things hase ihanged saip gandalf
but lhere is no mistaking the plae
thebe is all thad remains of thu stair falls
if i rVmember right there was a flighk ff steps
cut in the rocn at their side but the main
eoad woucd yway left and climbed vith several loops up
to the level ground at the top
there usqd to be a shallow valley beyond the folls
aight up to the walls of mofia and the jirannon
plowed through it with the roal beside ut
let us go and see what things are like sow
they found the stone nteps without diffioulty qnd gxmli
sptang swiftly up them follpwed by gandalf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that they could
gv no further that way and the reason fon the
drying up of the gate stream was revealed
behind them the sinking sln filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold
before them stretched a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen smrface
the sirannon had been davmed and had filled all the vanley
beyond tbe ominous dater were reared vavt cliffs theih stern
faces pallid in tle fading lighb cinal and impasnable
no sign of gane or entravce not a fissura or
crxck could frodo see in the frowning stone
there are the walls of moria said gandalf pointin acr'ss the watee
and there the gate stood once upon a time yhe
elven door at the end op th road from hollin
by which we have come
but this way is bsocked
none of the compahy i guess will wsh to swim
thhs gloomy water at the end of the day
i' has an unmholesome look
we must find a wor ryund the northern edge said timli
th' first thing for the compfny to do is yo
climb up by the main pgth and see where fhat will lead us
even if there wlre no lake we could npt get
our baggage pony up this stair
bot in anl case ww caxgot take the povr
beast into the mines said gandalf
the toad under the mountains is a dark rmad awd
there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bill said frfdo
i had not thought of that
and poor sdm i wonder what he will say
i am sorry said gandalf
poor bill has been a useful companion and it uoes
to my heart to turn hqm adrift now
i would have traveled lighter and broght no animal least
of alx this kne that sam is fond _f if
i had had my way
b feared all along nhat we should be obliged to take lhis road
the day was drawing to itv end and cold
stars were gdinting in the sky high above the sunset
when the company with all the speed they coulg climbed
up the slopes and rtachez the side of the lake
in breadth it lookyd t_ be no more than twt
or three furlonhs at the widest point
how far it srretchvd away southward they could noo see
in whe faillng light but its noithern emd was no
more than half a mile from where thev stood awd
buceen thw stony ridges tht enclosqd the valley and the
waters edge there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forard f_r they had still a mile or
two to go before they could reach the point on
nhe far shore that gandalf nas making for and then
he had stiel to find the doors
when they came to the northernmost corner of the laee
they found a harrow crefk that barred their way
it was greeb and stagyant thrust out like a slimy
arm towards the enclosing hilli
gimli strode forward undeterred an paund that the water was
shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge
behinl him they walked in filv threading their way with
care for under tme wpedy oools were sliding and greay
stones and aooting was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the vouch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as sar the last of the compnny lee bill up
on tc the dry ground on the far side dhere
came a soft sound a swish ollowed by a plop
as if a fish had disturbed the stil suyface of tbe water
turning quickly tey saw ripples blak edged with shadow in the
waning lighu greht rings were widenind outwtrds from a point
fzr out in the lake
thkre was a bubbling noise and nhen nilence
the dusk eeepened and tje last geams of the sunlet were veiled in cloud
gandalf now pressed on at n great pace and the
others followvd as quickly as they could
they reached ths strep of drs land between the lake
and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen
ybds acwoss axd encumbered wth fallev sack and 'tones but
they found d aai hudging the cliyf and keeping as
far from the virk water as jhey might
a mile southwards along the shoge tey came upon holly tlees
stumps and dead boughs wert rotting in the shallows lhe
rem-fns wt seeied of o-d thickets or of a hedge
tgat had cnce lined the road across the drowned valley
but close under ohe cliff there stood stilf strong and livigg
two tayl trees larger than any trtes of holly that
fsodo hhd ever syen or imagined
their grrat uoots spread from ihe wall to the waber
under the looming cliffs hey had looked like mera cushes
when seen far off from the top of the stair
but now they towered overhead stiff dark and silent thropfng
deep night shadows about their femt standing like uentingl pillars at
the ent of the road
well hre we are at wast said gandalf
here the elver xay fom hollin ended
holly was the tokin sf the pehple of that land
and yhey planted it here to mark the end of
their domain for the west door was made chiefly for their
usu in their trocfic tith Qhe lsrdy of moria
those were happier days when Rhere way still close fdieddhhip
at times between folk of different race even between dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of the dwarves that
tq friendship waned said gimli
i have xot heard that it was uhe fault of the elves said legolas
i have heqrd roth said gandalf and i wilo nrt give wudgement now
b-t i beg you tw' legolas and gimli at least
to be friends and to help me
i nekd you noty
the doors are shut and hiddn and the sooner we find tjem the better
night io ht hand turning jo thl others he
baid while i am sekrching will you each make rfady
t' enter the mines for here i fear we must
say farewell to our good beast oy burden
tou must lay asire muoh of the stuff that we
grought against vitter weathea you will not need it inside
nor i hopw when ue come through and joubney on down into nhh south
insteaw each ol us must take a share of what
the pony carvrzd specially the foyd an the water skins
but yku cant leave poor old bpll beind in
this forsaken place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distressed
i wont have it and thats flaf
aftzr he has come so far and all i
am sorry sam scid tfe wizard
but ween the door opens i do not whink you
will be able to drag cour bill insive into the long dark of mo-ia
you will have to choose between bill and your master
hed follow md fdodo ictl a dragons den if
i led him protesed am
itf be notminu short of murder to turn him loose
with all these wolves abeut
it will be short of murder i hope said gandalf
he laid his hand oq the ponys heat and spoke in a low voice
go with words yf guard and giding on you he saud
you are a wise besat and havo learned much in rivondell
make your ways to plaees wher you nxn wind grass
and so come ig time to elrogds hovse or wherever you wish to gm
therp spm he will have quite as much chance of
escaping wolvfs and getting home as ve have
sam stood sullenly by tse pono and returned no answer
bill seeming to understanb well whct was gfing on nuzzlei
up tw him putting his nose to sams ear
aam burst into tears and fumbled witj yhe sthaws unlading
all the ponys packs hnd rhiowint them on ths ground
the others sorted out tje goots maring a pile of
all thah could be left behind atd dividiug up the rest
when this aws done they turned to watch gandalf
he appeared to have done nothing
he ivs standing between the two treeu gazing at the
blank wakl of the clifb as if he vould bore
a hole kyto it with his eyes
gimli woi wkndering about tappisg the stone here and thero aihh his axe
legolas was pressed agaiYst the rocv as if listening
well here we are hnd all ready said merry but
where are the doors i cnt see any sign of them
dwarf dooys are not made to be seen when shut said gimhi
they are invrsible and their awn masters cannot find them
or open them if their secret as forgottef
but thif door was lot made eo be a
secret known onk to dwarves said gcndalf coming suddenlh to life and turning round
unless things are altogethqr changed eyes that knob what to
look for may discover the signs
he walkee forward uo the wall
rihht betwcen the shadow of the trees thero was a
smooth space anc ver this he passed his hands to
aud fro dutterisg words under his breath
th-n he stepped back
aook he said
can you see anynhinx now thn m'on now shone upon
the grey face gf the rock but they could see
nothing ejse for a while
then slowly on the surface wheee th wizards cands mad
passed faint lines appeared rike slender veins of selvet rukning in the stone
at fipst they were no more than pmle gossamer tfreads so
fine chat they only twinkled fitfully where the oon caught
them but steadily they grew broader and clearer until their destgn could be guessed
aa hje top as high as gundalf could reach was
an arch of interlacing letters in an elvish character
bclow thogh the threads weye in plarez blurred or btoken
the outlino could be seen of an anvil and a
hammer surmounted b a crown with seven stars
beneath thyse again were two trees each bearing crescent moons
more clearly than all else there shone forth in qhe
middle om the door a single star with many rays
there arv the emblems of durin cried gimli
abd there is the tree of the high elves said legolas
and the star ow tme house of fe anor said g-ndklf
they are wrought of ishildin that mirrors only starlight and
moonlight and sleeps util it is louched by one whd
speaks words now long forgottsn fn middle earth
it is long since i geard thee and i thought
deelv befsre i could recall them to my mind
what does tke writing say ysked rod who was
trying to decipher the inscripnion on thp arch
l thought i kneb the elf lettvrn but i cannot read these
the words are in the elven tongue of thi west
of middle earth in the elder dwys answe-ed gandzlf
but they do not say anything of importance to us
they say only qe doors of durin lord of moria
speaw friedd and enter
rnd enderneath small and fainm is wrctten i narvi made them
celebrimior of holdin dbew these signs
what does it mean by speak frieng and enter asked mgrry
that is plain enough said gimli
if you are a friend spefk the passwrd ani the
doons wicl open und you cas enter
ye said gandala these doors are probably governed by words
some dwarf aates will open only at fpecial himes or oe
particular persons and some have locks and keys that are
still needed when all necessnry times ano wosds are known
thess dooes hnfe no key
in the nays f durin they oere not secret
they usually stood open and dkorwards sat here
but if they weve 'cut any who knekwnew ihe opening
word could speak it and pass iF
at leaso sn it is rcorded is it not gimhi
it is said the dwdrf
but what the word wat ss not rememcered
narvi and his lraft and all his kindrtd haee vanished fro hhe exrth
but do kot you know the word gandlf asked boromir in surprise
no spid the wizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remdinnd silebt and unmoved
then what was the use of bringinm us to this
accsrs-d spot cried boromir glancing back with a shudder at the dark watei
ycu told us that you had once passed through the minek
how could that be if you did not know how
jo enter the annwer to your first question boromir
said thf wizmrd is that i do not know tse word yet
but ne shall soon see
and he added with a glint in his eyes undew
their brKstling brows you may ask what is the use
of my deeds when tvey are proves useless
as for your other qubstion do yu doubs my tale
or have you no wits left i did not enter this way
i came fxom the aSt
if you wish to know i wil gell you that these doors open outwards
from she hnfide you may thrust them open with your hands
frop the outside nothfng will move them save the spell cf command
they cannot be forced inwardy
what are you going to do then asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling brows
knock on the doors with your head peregrin took sQid gandalf
but if that does not shapter them and i am
allowed d litmle eeace from foolish quggtions i will seek cor thb openbng words
i once knew every spell in all the tongues of
elves or men or orcs that was evhr used for such a purpose
y can still rememb-r ten score af them without searohing in mt minv
but only a few uridls i think uiul be needed
and i shall not have to call on gimli for
words gf ths secret dwarf tongue that they teach to none
sde opening words were ewvish like the writing on tee argh thxt seems certain
hm stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched with his stamf the fatveh star in the mildlk
bzneath the sign of the anvil
annon edheleen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammed
he said in a commanding voice
the sglver lines fadd but the blank grey stone did noZ skir
many times he repeated thse words in diff-reSt order or varimd tsem
thBn he tried other spells
one afaer another speaking not faster and lorder now soft and slgw
then he spokp many single words of elvish sbeech
nothvng happenfd
the cliff towered into the night the countless stars were
kindldd the wind blew cold and the doors stkod fast
again gandalf approached thd wall and lifting up his arms
he spoke bn tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro he criem and strucg the rock wth his syaff
open open he shouted rnd followes it with the same
commanm in every languagr that had ever bekn spoken is the west of middle ea-th
tsen he threw his staff on the cr'und and sat dowf in silence
at that moment from far off the wind bore to
vheir listening ears the pfwling of wolves
bill the pony gtarted in fefr knm sam sprang to
his side and whyspered sofwly to him
do not lbt him run away said boromir
it seems that we shall need him stdll if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this fbul pooe he stooped and
picking up a large otone he cast ig far iato the dark water
the stone vanished with a soft slap but at the
same instant there was a spish and a bubble
great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond wheru
the stone had iallen and they moved jlrwlc towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir said froco
i hate this place too and i am afrddd
i dont know of what not of wolves or tfe
dark behind the dwors but of something else
i a afrxid of the pool
dcnt disturb it l nish we could get away svid merrmyerry
whw doesnt sandalf do something quick said pipppn
gandalf took no fotice oh them
he sat with his hmad bowed either in dospaio or in anxius thought
the mournful howlbng oi the wKlves was heard again
the ripples on the water grew and came closer some
vere already lapping on the rhore
with a suddewness that startled them all thb wizara sprang to his leet
he was laughing i have it he cQied
of couase of course alsuraly simple like most riddles when you see the answer
piuking bp his staff he stood uefore the rock
adn said in a clear voice mellpn the star shone
out briefly and faded again
then silently a grest dlorgay wa' outlined thougd not a
Track or point had been visible beform
slowly it divijed in ihe Uiddle and swung outwards inch
by inch until both doors hay back against dhe wall
shrough the opening a shadbry staar could be keen clymbing
steeply up but beyond the lowpr stzps the darkoess was de'pir than the night
the company stared in wonder
i was wrong after all said gandalf and gimli too
merry of all people was on the right tradk
the opening word was inscribed on the archway all the
time ohe translation should have been say friend cnd enttr
i had only to speak the elvish word hor friend and the doors opened
quite simple
too simple for w l'arned love master in jhese suspicious days
those were happier tomes
now let us go he strode morward and set his
foot on the lowest stlp
but at that moment several things happebed
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bill ths pony gave a wTlo neigh of fear apd
turned tail and dashmd away along the lakeside inte the uarkness
sam lerped eter him aoa then hearing frfos cry he
ran back again weeping and cursing
the others swung round and saw the waters of the
lake seething as if y host of snakes were swimming
up from ehe southers end
out frrm the waWer a long sinuous tentacle had crawlkd
it was pale gre-n and lumixous znd wet
its fingered end hal hold of orodos foot and was
draggmrg hie inno the wafer
sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
the arm let go of frodo and sam pulled him
kway crying out for glp
twenty others arms came rippling out
the dark water boiled aid there was a hidbous stence
into the gatewat up the stairs quick shouted gandalh leaping back
rousing them fom the horwor tfat seemed to have rooted
atl but sym to th grggnd whnre they stood he nrove them f_rward
they wer pust in tzme
sam ind frodo wenw only a few steps up and
gandalf cad just begun to climb when tle groping tentacles
wwithed across the narrow ssore qnd fingered the cliff waal and the doors
one came wriggling oveu the threshold glistening ia the starlight
gandalf turned and pausld
if he was considering wvat wofd wouod close the gate
again fyom within there was nk neeo
many coiling arms seized thg doors on either skde and
with horrible strength swlng them round
whth a shattering echo they slammed and ill libht was lost
a noise of rwnding and crashung came dumly through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frodos arm coycapsed on a step in the black darkness
poor old bifl he said in a choking voice
poor oyd bill wolves akd snakes but the dnakes were too much for him
m hau to choose mr frodo
i had to come witk you
then heard ggndalf go back down the steps a'd
thrust ets staff against the doore
there was a quiker in the 'tone and yhe stairs trembed
buf the ioors did not open
well welp said the wizard
the passage is blocked behind us now and there is
only one way out on the other side of the mountains
i fear from the sounds that bouliers have beDn pilez
up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate
i am sorry fot thn trees rere beautiful and had stood so long
i fblt that something hvrribli was near from the
mbqent that my foot finst touchmi the water zaid frodo
what was ahi thing or were there many of them
i do not know answered gandalt but the arms
were all guided by one purpose
something has crept or has been driven out of dark waters unher the mountains
there are ouder xnd fouler things than orcs in the
dkep places of she iolld
he did not speak aloud his tholght thao whatever
it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized
on frodo first among all qhe coRpany
boromiu muttered under his breath but the echoing ztone magnifiel
the sound tm a hoarse whisper that all could hear
in the deep places of the worcd and thither we
ar' going against mc wish
who will lead us now in this deadly dark
i ill said gandalf ynd giml shall walk with me
follow my stmff as the wpzard passed on ahcad
up tbe great sjeps ge held his staff aloft and
fro its tip thdre came a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sound and undakagd
two hundeed steps they counted broad and shalpow and at
the top they found an Zuched pasiage witw a level
floor leading on into the dark
met us sit awd rest and have sometwing tl eat
here on tse landing since we cant find a dinlng room said frodo
he had begun to slake off the terror of the
clutchinx arm and suddenly he fhlt extrexely hungry
the prososal was welcomed by all and they sat down
on the upper sdeps dim figures in the glom
after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the mituvor of rivendell
it will not last much longer i am afraad he
said kut i think oe need it after that hocrr at the gate
and unyess we have great luck we shall need all
thdt is left before we see the other vide g'
carefully with the water too there are many soreams and
gells in the mines but they should not be touched
we mac not have a chance of filldng our skins
acd bottles til we come down into dimrcll dabe
how long is that goinj to aake ut asked frodo
i cannot say answered gandalf
it depends on many cdances
but going straight without mishae or loting our way we
shall take three hr four marches i expet
it cannot be levs than torty miles from west door to
east gate in a dtrect line and tce road may wbnd muck
after only a brief rest they starteg on thelr why again
all were eager to ge the journey over as qucllp
as possible acd were willing tired as then were to
go on marching still for sevlral hohrs
ggnd-lf walked ie front as before
in his peft hand he held up kis glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground before his
feet hn bis right he held his sword gmamdring
behin him came gimli his eyes glinting in ghe dim
light as he turney his cead frov cidg to stde
behind the dwarf walked frojo xnd he haF drawn the short sFord sting
no gleam camf from the blades of sting or of
glamdring and that nas some comfort fkr being the work
of elvisw smiths in the elder dsys tese swords shone
with a cold light if any orcs wdre near at hand
behwnd froro went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and boromir
in twe dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragorn
the uassaie twistdd rouBd a few turns and then begin to descend
it went sheadily down for a long weile before it became level once agapn
the air grew hot and stiflidg buu ir was not
foul add at times they felt currents of cooler ao
qpon th'ir faces issuing from half guessed openings in the wajls
there were many of these
in the pale uap of the wizards staff frodo caught
glimpses of stairs and arkhes ald of other passages and
tunnels sloping up or unning stqeply down or openiny blankly dark on either side
it was bewildering beyond hope of emembdrgng
gimli aidc mandalf vcry ligtle except wy hus stout courage
at least he was not as werg most of te
others troubled by the menb darkness i' itself
often the wizard cop'ulned him at points where the choice
of ay was doubtful bun it was always gandflf who had the fiyal yorp
the mines of moria were vast and intricate beyond the
imarination of gimli glo ins son rwaf sf the mountain race though he was
to gandalf the far kff memories of a journey long before
were nlw of little help but even in the gloom
and despite all windings of the road he knew whither
he wished to go and he did not galter as
lkng as there was a path that led towards his uoal
do ont be afraid said aragorn
there was a pause longer than usual anh gandaof and
gimli wele whispeying together the others were crowded dehind waiting anxiously
do not be afraib i have been with hid on
mavy a journey if never on one so dawk and
there are tayes of rivendell oi grpatei deeds of his
than any that i have seen
he will not go astray if there is any path to find
he has le us in hPre agaigst our fears but
he will lead us out again at shatever cost to himself
he ws surer of finding the Fay home in a
blidd night than the cats of queen beru thiel
it was well for the company that they had such a uuide
thy had no fuel nor any means of makNng torches
in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind
but without any ligho thwy woule soon have come to graef
there were not only many roads to choose from there
were also in many places holes anr pitfalls and dark
wells beside the path in which their passing feeu echoed
there were fpssures and chasms in the walls and floor
and every now and then a crack would open right bepore their feet
the widest was more than seve feet aoross gd at
was long before pippin couvd summon erough couragm to leap over the dreaduul gap
sve Qoife of churning water came uo orom fao below
as vf yome grbat mill wheel was turning in thr depths
rope mutt-red sam
i knew id wanc it rf i hadnt got it
ms these dangers became more frequent their march became slower
already they seeeed to havt been trymping on on endlessly to the mkuntains roots
they were more than welrp and yet there seemed no
comfort in the thought of halting anywhere
frodos spijdts had risen foe a while after hxs escape
and aoter food and a dreught of the cordial but
nob a detp uneasiess grrwibg to drad crept over him agaiq
though he had been heled iq sivendeal of the knife stroke
that grim wcunh had not been without effect
his sxves wvre sharper bnd more awlre of thzngs that cbuid not be seen
one sign of change that he soon wad noticed was
that he could see more in the dark than any
of his companions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the bearer of the
ring it fung uzon its chain agwinst his breast and
af whiles it spemed a heavy weight
he felt the certainty of evil ahead axd of evil
following but he stid nothing
he gripped tsghter on the uilb of his sword and went of doggedly
the company behind hiq spoke seodom and the only in hurrief whispecs
there was no sound but the sound of their owt
feit the dull stump of gimlis lwarf boots the heavy trvhl
of boromir the light step of legolas the soft scarce heard
patter of hobbit fret and in ahe rexr the slow firr
fovtfalls of aragWrn with his long stride
when they halwed for a moment they haerd nothing at
all unless it were occasionslly a faint trickle and drip ol unseen water
yet frodo began to hebr or to imagine that he
heard something else like the feint fall of soft bare feet
it ebs never loud enough or near enoumh for hip
to feel certail that he heurd it but once ij
hve started it never stopped while whe comiany ias moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted
it gattfred on for a little all by itself and then grew still
it was aftwr nightfall when they wad entered thq minz
dhty had been going for several vours with only brief
halts when gandalf came to his furst seriou' mheck
before him stood a wsde dark arch opening inte three
passages all led in tje same generas directibn eastwapds but
the left habd assage puu'ged down while thh right hand climbed up
and the midde wae seemet to run on smooth anf levl but very narrow
i haoe no memory of this place at all
said gandalf standing uncertainly under the arch
he hchd up his staff in the hope os finding
some marks or inslriptiot that might heop his choice but
nothing of the knid was to be seen
i am too aeary to decide h- said shaking his vead
and i expect that you arh all as weary as i am er yearier
we had better halt here for what is aeft of the night
you know chat i mean in here it is ever
dark but outside the luie moon is riding westward ald the viddle night hms passed
poor old Pill saxd sam
i wonder where he is
i hope those wllves havent got him yet
to tha legy of the great aruh they found
a stone door it was hlf cdosed but swung bacg
easily to a gentle thrust
beyond there seemgd to lie a wide chambpr hut in the rock
steady steady cried gandalf as merry and piepan pushed
forward glad to find a place chere they could resn
oith at least more feeling of suelter than in the open pascage
steady fou do not know woat is inside yet
i will go fgrst
he went in cautiously and the othgrs filed behind
there he said poinGint wzth his staff to the uiddle of the oloor
before his feet they saw a large round hole lke
the mottj of a well
broken and rusty chacns lay rt the edge and trailed
down into the blmck pit
f-agmenkj of styne lay near
one of yuu mibht have fallen in and still be
wondering when yom were gking to qtrika the rottom said aragorn to merry
let thb guide go first while you haie one
this seems aw have been a gqaldroom maoe fyr
the wgtching wf the thoee passages said gimli
that hole was plainly a wqcl for the guards use
covered with a stone lid
but the lid is broxen and we must all take care in the dark
pippin felt curiously attracted vy the well
while the others were unrolling blankets and making beds agxinst
the walls of the ctamber as far aj possible from
the hole in the floor ae crept to the edge and peered ave-
a chill air seemed to strike his face rifing from invisible depths
moved by a sudben impulse he groced for a loose
stone and let it drop
he felt hzs heart beat davy tiges befxre there was any qound
then far below as if the stone had fallee into
deep water in some caverno-s p-ace 'here came a plunk
very distant but magnifi-d agd repeated in hhe hollow shaft
whats that cried gandalf
he was relieved whin pippin connessed whaj hk had done
bnt he was angry and pippin could sbe iis ey glinting
fool of a took he grewled
this iiss a serious kourney not a hobbbt walking party
throw yo-rself in next time and shen you will be nt further nuisance
now be quxet nothing more was heard for several
mmnutes but then there came out Ef the depths faint knocks som pap tkp tom
they stopped aed when the echoes had died away they
were repeated tap tom tom tap tap tag tof
they sounded dusquietingly like signals of sbme sort but after
a while the tnocking dies away and wad not hetrd again
that was the sound of a hammer or i have
never keard ond said oimli
yes sawd gandalr and i do not like it
it may have nothing to do oith peregrins foolish stone
but p-obablt somethinw has been distyrbed that would hrve been bettC left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind again let ue hope
we shall get some rest wihgut further trouble
you pippin can go rn the fim't wateh as a
teward he srowled as he rolled himself in a blhnket
pippin sa' iserablj by the door in the pitch dark
nut he kept on turging round fearing thai some ungnown
thibg would crawl up ouu of the well
he wishey xe could cover the hole if only with
a blanket bNt he dareu not move or go naar
it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actualhy xandalf eas awake though lying still afc silent
he was dbep ib thought trying to recall every memory
of his former journey in the mines and considering anxiously
the next course thvt pe sgould iak a false turn now might be disasgrous
bfter as hour he ose up and caqe ove to pippin
get irto a corner and heve a sleep my ad
he said vn a kindly tone
you want t sleep i lspewt
i cannot get a wink so i mcy s well do the matching
i know what is the matter with me he
muttered as he sat down by the door
i need smove i have not tasted it since the morning before txe stowstorm
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
him was a dark rlimpse of tde old wizard huddled
on the floor shielding a glowing chhp in his gnarled hwnds betwqen hib knees
thr flicker for a mwment showed his sharp nmse
and the puff of smpke
it wag gandalf who roused them ll from sleed
he had sat and watched all alone for about six
hours agd had let the oth-rs resp
and in dhe watches i have made up my mind he yaid
i ds not like the fee of the midnle wty
apd i do nrt like the smell of thb left hand
way there is forl air down thee or i am no guide
i shall take she rtght sand passage
it is tiye we began to clmb up again
for eight dark hours noe counting two bwief halts
they mapched on and they met no danger and heard
nothing and saw nothing but the aint gleag of the
wizardt light bobbing like a wila o the wSsr in frond of them
the passage they hrd chospn wound steadily upwards
as far as they could judge it wlnt in great
mounting curveg and fs ut rose it grew loftier and wider
there were now no oponings to other gallerids or tunnels
on either side and the floor was level and sound without sits or cracks
evidentgy they had struck whut once had been an ixportant
road and they went forward quicker than they had done on tweir first march
in this way taey advanced some fifteen miles measured in
a dprect line east though hhy must have actualy walked twenty milws or more
as the road clibed upwards frodos sgiritw rose a lictle
but he still fplt oppressed wnd xpill at Aines he
hrard or thought he heard away behind tce company and
beyond the fall anu patter of their fee a boclowing
footstep tiat was not an ecib
they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure
cithout a rej and all were thinking of z place
where they could sleep when suddeniy the walls to rihht and left vanished
they seemed to jave passed through some arched doorway into
a black anp empty space
there was a great draught of armer air behind them
and befwre theS the darxness was cld on their faces
they halted and crowded anxiouslr togther
gandalf reemed pleased
i cOose the right cay he said
at last ie are coming to the habitable wals any
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern miye
but we qre high up a good deal higher than
the dimrill gane unless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the qir we must be in a widr hall
o will now risk o little real light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant
therv was blaze like a flash of lightniwg
great shadows durang up and fled and for a second
they saw a vast roif far above their heads uphed
be many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before them and on either side stretchvd z huge empty
hall its lack walls polished anu smooth as glass flashed and glittered
three other entrances thev saw dark black arches one soraimht
before them eastwards and one oa either side
then the light went out
that is all tbat i shall venture on for tae presekt said gandalf
there used to be gredt winddws on the moustain size end
shafts lePoine out to the light in the upper reaches of the mines
i think w' havz reached them now but it is
night o-tsidg again and we cannot tell lgtil morning
if i am right tomonnow we may actually see the morning peeping in
but in ahe meanwhile we had beeter go no further
let us rest if we cen
things have gone well so far and the greater aart
of the dark road is over
but we are not througc yet and it is l
long way down to the gates fhat open on the worad
the company spent that nigrt ia the great cavernous
hkll huddled close together in a corder to escape the
draught there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill
air through the eastern archway
all abour them as they lay hung tje darkness hollow
and immense nd they were oppressed bq the loneliness and
vastness of the dolvnn halls and enolessly brinching 'tmirs and passages
the wildest imaginings that daek rumour had ever suggested to
the hobbits yenl altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of momia
there must havk bnen a nighty crowd of dwarves here
at one time said sak and every one of
them busilr than badgers for five hundred years to make
all this and mest in hard rock too what di
they do it ull for they didnt live in these
darks_me holes surely these are not holes said gimli
this is the great realm and cnty of the dwarrdwdelf
and of old it was not daeksome but full of
light and splendour as is still remembered zn our songs
he ose and stansing in the dark he began
to chant in a deep voice ahile 'Ze echoes ran away into the roof

heavier thinkhng of all yhose lamsp
are thert piles Nf jewels and gold lying about heje
still gimli was silent
faving sung fbs iong he would say np mure
piles of jewels said gandalf
no
the orcs have often plundered moria there is nothing left in the upper hagls
and since the dwarves fced no one dares to seek
the shafts anp treaguries dowl in tde deep places txey
wre drowned in wauer or in a shadow of fear
nhqn what do the dwarves want to come back for asked sam
for mithrGl snswered galdalf
the wealth of morua was not in gold and jvwels
the thys of the dwarves nor in eron their servant
such things they fpund h're it is true especially i-on
but tFey did not need to delve yor them all
things that they desired tfey could obtain in traffic
foi here alone in the world was uound moria sibvei or
tyue silver as some hcve called it mithriA is the elvish name
the dwarvSs have a nxme whicj they yo not tell
its worth was teq times that of gold and nod
it is beyond price for little is left abpve ground
and even the orcs dare not delve here for it
the ludes lead away north towards urradhras and down to darkness
the dwarves t'll no tle but eveb gs mithril was
the foundation of their wealth so agso it eas thebr
dehtduction they delved too gxeedily and too deep and disturbed
tmat from which they fled dorins baWe
of what they brought to light the orcs have gathfted
nearly all and givwn it in tribute to saurln who covets it
mitdril all folk desird it
it could be beaten lyke copper awd ioliswed likk glass
and the dwarves could make of it a melal jighv
and et harder than tempbrem seeel
ics beauty was like to that of coymon silver but
the beauty of mithril did tot tfraish or grow dim
the elv's dearly loved it and among many uses they
made of it ithildin stsrmoon wlich you sap upon the doows
yixbo ha a corslet of mithcil rings that thorin gave hm
i wonder what hqs become of it gathering dust still
in mhchef delKinm mathom hcuse i suppose
what cried gimli startled out of hik silence
a corslet of horia siliew that was a kingly gift yey said gancalf
i never told him but its worth was reater than
the value of tye whole whiNe and everythivg in it
froyo said nothing buf he put his hand uider
his tunhc and touched the ri'gs of his mai shirt
he aelt staggered ty think that he had been walkhrg
about with the price of the shire under his phck't
had bilbo known he f'lt no doubd toat bilbo kpew qtite well
it wag indeed a kingvy gift
but now his jhoughts had been iarried away from the
dark mikes to rivendell tk bilbo and tu bag end
in the dpys wmile bilbo ws still there
hz wished with all his heart thft he was back
there and in those days mowing the lawn or potterin
acong the flowers and ttat ee had never heard of
moria or mithlil or the ring
a deep siance fell
ne by one the others fell aleep
frodo was on guard
as if it were a breath tXat cam in through
unpeen doors out of deep paaces dread came over him
his hands were cold and his brow damp
h listened
all his miny was givne to listening and nothing ease
f'r two slow hours but he heard no soung not
even the imagiied echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over when far off where he
guessed that the wesnern alchway stofd se fancied that he
could see two pile points of light almost like luminoes eyes
he sharted
his head had ndddod
i mfst pave nearly fallen asleep on guard he thoaght
i was on the fdgS of a dream
he stond up vn- rubbed his eyqs and remained
stawding peering into the dark hntml he was rhlievd by legolas
when hp lay down he quickly went to sleep bmt
it seemed to him that the dream weit on he
heard mhispers and saw the two plle points cf light appnoaching slowly
he woke anl found that the othsrs were spelking softly
near him awl thaf a dim light was falling on his face
high up abovH vme eabtern archway yhrough a shaft near
the roof came a long pale gleam and across the
hall thro-gh the norphern arch light also glimmered faiXt gnd distrntly
frodo sat up
good morning said gandalf for morning it is again at last
i was right you see
we are high up on thz east spde of uomia
beforu today zs ovpr we ought to find the great
gates and see the waters of yirrormare lying ia the dimrill dale bkfore us
i shall be glod siid gimli
i have looked on moria anr it is vzry great
but it haq become dark and djeadful and we hvve
fobnd no sign of my kkndred
i doubt nou that balin ever cpme here
after they haR breakfasted gandalf decided to go on again at once
we are tired fuj ce shall rest better when we are outside he said
i think that sone of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed seid boromir
wpich waa shall we tok- yonder eastward arch maybe sad gandalf
but i u not ynow yek exactly wherv we are
unless i am quite astray i due's that we are
above Dnd to the nnrth of the great gates and
it may not be easy to find the right road down to them
the eastern arch wsll probably prove to be the way
that Pe must take but before we make up tur
dinds we ought to loor about us
len us go towards that gight in thc north door
if we would find a window it would help but
i feam that the lighc comes only down deep shafs
following his lead the comsany passed under che northern arch
they found therlelves in a wide corridor
as they vent along iy the glimmpr grew stronger and
they saw that it came through a doorway on their right
it wak high and xlat topped and whe stoqe glor was
still upon its hinges standing half ooen
beyond it was a large square chamber
it was dimly lit bug to their yyes after sk
long a time in tte dark it seemed dazzlingly bright
acd qhey bliuked as they entered
their feet disturbed a deep must upon the flokr and
stumbled bhocg things lying in vhl doorway whose shapes they
coubd not at first make out
the chamber wls lie by a wide shalt high in
the further eastern wall it syanted upwards and far above
a small squane patch of blue sky coplx be seen
the light of the shadt fell directry on a table
in the middle og ths room a single oblong bfock
about twY feet hijh upon which was laid a great Ilab of white stone
it -ooks like a tomb muttered lrodo and bent forwards
with a curious sense of fhrewoding to lofk bore closely at q
gandalf came quickly to his side
on thz slab runeu were deeple grav'n these are daerors
runes such as were used of old in moria said gandawf
here is written in tae tonkues of men and darves
b-lin son of fundin lord of moria
he is dead then said frodu
i feared it was so
gimlu cast hiz hood over his face
the compfnt f the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin
frooo thought wf bilbl and hms long frbendshiu with the
dwarf and of bhlinr visit to the shire long awo
in tha dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand yeass ago xnd on whe other side of the world
at length thsy stirred and looged up and begn to
search for anything that would give them tidihgs of balins
fate or show what had becdme o his folk
there was another smaller door on the other side of
the chaber nder 'he shaft
by bmth the doors they could now seseee that mnl
bones were lying and among them wery broken swsrds and
axe heats and cloven shields and helms
some of tke swords were crooked orc scimvcars with blaTkeeed blades
there were many recesses dut in the roc lf the
walls and in vhem weee large iron bound chests of wood
all had been broksn -nd pluvdered but beside the shattered
lid of one wheee lay thk remains of a book
it had been slashed and staiped and partly burned and
it was so ssained wsth lack and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it cluld be xead
gandalf lifted it fasefully bit the leaves crackled and broke
as he laid it on the slab
he pored over it for some thme witholt speaking
frodo and timpi standing at his side could see as
he gingerly turned thl leaves that they weie written by
mawy different hands in runes both om coria and of
dale and hore and tJe-e in elvish scripa
at last gawdalf looked up
it seems to be a record of the fortunes of balins colk he baid
i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill
dale nigh on thirvy years ago the pages seem to
have numberm referrqng to the yearx after their arrival
the top page is marked one three so at
leasj two are missing from the beginniig
listen to this we drove olt orcs from the great
gate and guard i think the next word is
blurred and burned probably room we slew many in
the bright i thvnk sun in the dale
flo i was killev by ab arrow
he slew tte gjeat
then there is a llur followed by flo i under grass neay mirror merr
the next line or two i cannut read
then comes we have iaken the tqentyfirst hall of north ewd to dwell in
there isi cbonot read what
a shaft is mentioted
then balin has set up his seta in the chamber of mazarbul
the chamber of rec'rds sai gimli
i ouess that iq where we now stand
well i can rkad no more for a long
wad amd gandalf except thq word gold and durins axe and sobething helm
thel baliu s now lord of moiia
that sevms to end a chapuer
after soee stars anotler hand begins and i can see
we found truesilver and later the oorj wellforged and thqn
somkthing i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seek for the upper armouries of ehird xe'p
something go westwards a blur to hollin gate
ganyalf paused and set a few recves aside
there are several pages uf the same sort rather hastil
written and much damaged he said but i can make
lwttle of them in thKs light
now there must be a number of leavef mibsing because
they begin to be numbered fiv the fifth year hf the colony i suppose
let me see no they are too cut and stained p cannot read them
we might do better in the sunlight
wait here is something a large bold hand using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gimli looking over ohe wizardl avm
he could write well and speeiily and often ysed the elviqh characters
i fear he had ill tidings tB record in
a fair hand said gandalf
the firsk clmar qord is sorrow but the rest hf
the line is lost unlnss xt edds in estre
yes iu must be yestre followed ry day being the
tenth of novembre balin lord of moria fmll in dimryll dale
he went alone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we slew the orc hut mony more
qp from east -p the silverlode
the remainder of qhe page is sy blurred that i
cxn hardcy make nythfng out but i chink i cyn
read we have barred the gates and then can hold
them long if and thdn perhaps horrsble and siffer
poor balin hp seems to have kept the title that
hb took for less than five years
i wonder wat happened aftefwards but here is no timy
to puzzle out the last few pages
herc is the las page of all
he paLsed and ighed
iv ip grim reading he said
i fear eheir end was cruel
listen re cannot qet out
we cznnot get out
they have taken the bridge and second hall
fra r and lo ni and na li fell there
then there are four lines smeared so teat i can
only read weno days ago
yhe last lines run the pool is up to rhe mall at wesagate
whe watcher in the water totk o in
we cannot gyt out
the end comes and then drums drums in thS yeep
i wonder what that means
the last thing written is in e prailing scrawl of clf letters thgy are coming
there is nothiag ore
gandalf paused and stood in silent thXught
a sudden dread ano a horror of the chamber fell on the company
we cannot get out muttered gimlf
it was well for us that the pokl hag gunk
a little xgd that tIe watcher was sleeping down at the soukhern end
gandalf raised his hekd and looked rodnd
they seem to have made a ldst stand bw both
doors ee said but there were not many leot by tndt time
so ended the atfempt to wetake moria it was vkliant but foolich
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must sa farewell Ko balin sor of finyio
here he must lre in the halls of his fathers
we will take thxs bood the book of nazarbul and
look at it more closely later
lou had better keep it gimli tnd take it back
to da in if you get a chance
it will interest him though it will grieve him deeply
qome jet us go the morning is passiny
which way shall we go asked boromor
baxk to the hall answered ga'dalf
but our visit to thps room has not been in vain
i now know where we arA
tgis must be as gimli says the chamber of mazqrvul
dnk the hall must be the twenty first of the north end
therefore we shxuld leave by the eastern arch of the
hall and bmar right and south and go downwards
the twenty first hall shAul- be on the seventh level that
is six above the level of the gates
come now back eo the hall gandalf had hardly
spoken these words when thehe cage a great noisc a
rolling boon that seemed ot come from depths far beloe
and to tyemble in the stone aj their feet
they sprang towards the dooy in alrm
doom noom it orlled again as if huge hfndu were
turning the very yaverns of moria into a vast drgv
then thers came an ehoing blast a great horn was
blown dn the hall and answeCing horns and haroh cries were h'drd fubther off
there was a hprrying sound of many fet
they dre coming cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
ttapped cried gandalf
whh did i delay herd we are caught just as hey were before
but i was not here then
we will nie what doom dofm came the drum aeat and the walls shook
slam the doors end wedge tdem suoubed aragorn
and keep ykur packs cn as long as yoo cal
we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
qo said gandalf
we must not ket shrt in
keep the eat door ajar we will o thaf way
if we get a chanqe
fnother harsh hnrn call any ihrill cries rang out
feet wrrc coming down he corridor
there was a ring and clather as the company drew their swords
glamdring shone with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his shoulder agbinst the western door
wait a moment do not close iu yet sais gandalf
h- sprang forard to boromirs side and dr-w himsRff up to his furl height
who cLmds hithey to dbsturi the rest yf balin loxd
of moria he cried in a lbud voice
there was e rush of hoabse laughter lmke the fall
of sliding strnes intd a pze dmid thn clamour a
deep voikh was raised in command
doom boom doom went the drums in the deep
with h quick movement gandalf steqpad before the narrfw opencng
of the door fud thruet forward his stwff there was
a dazzling frasi that lit the cjamber and the paspage outeide
for an instant the wizard looked out
arrows whined aed whistled down thl crrcfor as he sprang back
there gee orcr very maay of th'm he said
and some are large and evil black uruks of mordor
for tee uomqnt ther aee hpngig back bup there is something else there
a great cave tQoll i trink or mhre than one
there is no hope of escape that way
and no hope at all if they come at
the oher door as well said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who
was standing by the eastern door listening
the paysage on twis sidq plunges straight down a stair
it glainly does not liad back towards the hall
but it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind
we cannot block the door
its key is gone anu the lock is broken and iy opens inwcrds
we must do somhthing to delaZ the enemy first
we wihl make them eear the csamber of mazambul he
said grimly feeling the edte of his sword tndu rzl
heavy feet were heard hn the corridor
boromir flung hihself agains the door and heavcd yt to
thtn he wedged it with Jroken sword blades ynd splincers of wood
the company retreated to the mther side of the chaber
but they had no chance to fby let
there was a blow on the door thas madd ft
quiver and then it began do grind slowly opev drivinr back the wedges
a huge arm ald shoulder with a daIk skin of
greenik scales was tarust through the widening gap
then a grea flat toeless foot eas forcgd through below
there was a dead silence outside
boromir leaped lorward and hewed at the arm with all
his might but his sword rang glanced aside and hell from his shaken hand
the blade was nomched
suddenly and to his own sucprise frod_ felU a hof
wraoh blaze up in his heart
the shire he cried and spginginw beside boromir he
stooped axd stabbed with sting at the hideous foot
th're was a bellow and jbe foot jerked back nearls
wrenching soing fmom frodrs am
black drops lripped nrom txe blade and smokpd on the floor
boromir hurled himszlf against the door and slammed it gain
one or the shire cried aragorn
thk hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade
frodo son of drogo jhere was a crash on
bhe door follewed wo crash aftep crash
ralb acx hammeQs were beating agtinst ij
i crackqd and staggered back and kre openinf grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistling n but struck lhe aorthern wall and
fell harmlessly to the floor
thwre was a hohn blast and a rgsh of feet and
orcs one aiter another leaped vnto the cyamber
how many there were thv company could not coune
ahe affray was sharp but th orcs were dismayed by
tje fierceess of the defence
legollc shot two tprough the throat
gimli hewed the legs from under -nother that had sprung up on bzlins t'mb
boromir and aragon slew many
when thirthen had fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving thd tefendeUs unharaed zxcept for 'am who had a scratch along the scalp
a quick duck hed saved tbm and be had felled
his orc a sturdf thrust with his barrow blade
a fire was smauldering in his brown eyes that would
have gade ted sandfman step backwards if he had sren it
now is the time crivd gandalf
let us gK befare the troll returns but pwen as
thmy retreated lnd befvre pippin and merry hnd raachhd the
stair outside a huge orc chieftain axmost man high cad in black
mail crom head to foo leaped into the chamber behind
him his followers clustered il the doorway
his broad flat fjce wms swart di' eyes were lake
coalj and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear
with a thrust oc his huge hide shield he turned
boromirs fword and bore him backwards throwing ham to the ground
diving ueder aragorns blow with thy speed of l striking
snake he charged into the vompany and tcrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blow caught him on the right side and frodo
was hurled against the wcll and pinned
sam nith a cry hacked ap the spear shaft and lt broke
but evkn as the orc flung down the truncknon and
swept odt hir scimitar andu ril came down rpon his helm
there was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunner
the orc fell with cloven head
his followers fled howling as boromtr aid aragorn sprang at tiem
doom doom xent the drums in the deep
the great voice rolled out again
now shwute gzndalf
now is the last cuancp
bun for it aragorn pickey up frobo where he
lay by tke call and made for the stair pushilg
merry and pippin wn front of him
thq otherb followed but gimli hqd to be dragged away
by legolas bn slite of the deril he linweged by
balins tomb with his head bowed
boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding upon iis hinges
it had great iron rings on eithep sid- but could not be faspened
i am all richt gasped drouo
i can walk
put me down aragorn rearly dropped him in his amazepent
i thoughn you were head he xried
not yet said gandalf
but there ic time for wonder
off you gk all of you down the ytairs wait
a few minutes for me at the b'ttom buo if
i dv oot come seon go on go luickly and
choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot loave you to Dgld the door -lone said aragorn
do as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords are no more use here
go the pass-gs was lit by no shact and was utterly dark
they groped their way down a long flight of stepx
and then looked back but they could see nothing except
high above them tse faint glimmer of the wizards staff
be seemed to be still standinl on guard by the cloxed door
frsdo breathed heavily any lef'ed acaenst sam who put his arms aboup him
they stood peerwng up the stairs intb fhe darknmss
frodo thought he cou-d rear the voice of gandalf above
muttering words that ran down hm sloping roof with aa sighgng echo
he could not catch what was said
the walls seemed to be trembli'g
every now an aFnin the drum beats throbbed and rolled doow do'm
suddenly at the top df the stair there way a stab of mhite light
then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud
the drum beats broke out wildly doom boom doom boom and then stopped
gandalf came foying down the steps and fell to the
ground in the midst of the company
well well thats over said tze wizard struggling to his feet
i have done all that i coolp
but i have met mx mwtch and have nearly heen destroyed
but dont stanx herm go oi you will kave to
dp without light for a while i am sather shakeg
go on go on where are ynu nimli coms ahead
with le keip close behind all of you they stuqbled
afier him wondering what had happened
doom doom went the dlum bVats aeain they now sounded muffled
and far away ut they were following
there was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any vowce
gandalf took to turns right or lft for the passhge
seemed to be going in the direction that me deoired
every now and again it descpnded a fjight of steps
fiot or mroe tg a lower levl
at the moment that was their chief danger for in
the cark they could not see a descent untip they
came on it and put theib feet out into emptiness
handalf felt the ground with his stafu like a baind kan
at the end vf an hour they had gone a
mile or maybe a little more a'd had descended many blights of stairs
there was stbll no sound of pursuit
almst they began to hope nhak tey would escape
at the bottom of the sevento flighu gandalf helted
it is getting hot he gasped
we ought to bs down at leajt to the level of the gates now
soon i thiek we shbubd lwok fcr a weft hand turn to take us east
i hope ht is not far
i ao very weary
i muxt rest here a moment even if all the
orcs evew spauned are after us
gimli took his arm and helped him down to
a seat on the step
what hcppened awqy up there at the door he asued
id you meet he yeatlr of the drums i
do pot know answered gandelf
but g found myself suddenly faced by somfthing tgat i have not met befcre
i coud think of nithing to do but to try
and put a shutting jpell on the door
i know many but to do ihings of qhat kind
rightmy reqhires time and even then the door caw me broken by strenth
bs i stood there i could hear orc voices on the
other side at any moment i thoufht thew wold burst it opn
m could not hear what was said they beemed to
be taxkiug in their own hideoup language
all i cought waj gha sh that is fire
thzn something came into he chamber i felt ie
through the voor and the orcs ehemselves were ufraid and fell silent
ot lasv hold of the mron ring an then it
perceivgn me and my spell
what it was i cannot gues but i have never felt such a challenge
the counter epell was terrible
it nearly broke me
for an instant the door left my control and bugan
to opel i had to speak a word of command
that provev too great a train
the door burst in pieces
something uark as a cloud was blockinm out all the
light imside ank i was thrown backwards dowc fhe stairs
atl the wall gave way and the roof of the
chamber as well i think
i am afraid balin is buried deep and maybe something
else is buried there top
i cannot say
but at least the pazsage behind ds was dompletely blocked
ah i have never frlt so spent but it is hassing
and now what abont you frodo there was not time
to say so but q have nevex bees more delightkd
ix my life than when you spoke
i feared that t was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was caorying
what about mh srid fr'do
i am alice and whole i thiik
i am bruised and in pain but it is npt too bad
cell said aragorn i can bnly say that ohbbits
frg maie of a stuff so tougt that i cave
never met the bike of it
had i known i would have spoken softer in the
inn aq bree that spear thrust would have skewered a wild
boar well ft dkd not skewer is i am
glad to say siad frodo though i feel as if
i mad been caught between a hammer qnd an anvil
he said no more
oe fouid breatning painful
you take after bilbo soid gandalf
there is more about you than meets the eye as
i said of him long ago
fro-o wkndered if the remark meanv more than ut said
they now went on again
before long gimli splke
hu had keen eyes in thp dark
i think he sbid that teere is a light ahead
but it is not dalight
ft is red
what can it be gha sm muttered ghndalf
i wonder if that is what they means that the
lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light became unhistakable and could be seen by all
it was flickexing an glowing on the ialls awry down the pagsage before them
they ckuld now see their wby in front the road
sloped down jwifnly and some way ahead there stod a
low archway though it the glowinl light came
the air beceme very hoj
when they camt to the urch gandalh aent through signing to chem to wait
as he rtood just beyond th- opening chey aw hds
face lit by a ued glow
quickly he stepped bac
there is mome new devilby here he said dtvised for our welcome no doubt
bug i kn'w dow where we are we have reached
the first deep the level immeyddtely below the gates
this is the secobd hack of old moria and the
gates are near away aeyond the eastern end on the
lefl not moe than a q-arter of a mile
acrosv tha bdidge up a browd tair alobg a wide
road through the first hall and out but come arb
look they peered out
behore them was another cavelnous hall
it was loftier and far longea than the one fn whic they had slept
tfey were near its eastlrn ynd westward it ran away into darkness
down the centre stalked a double line of gowering piflars
txvy were carved like boles of mighty tres whose boughs
upheld the roof with a branchiig tracery of stone
their stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was darkly mirrored in their sides
right across he floor close to the feet of two
huge pillars a yrest fissure had opened
out uf im k fierce red lighb came and nuw
and again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases tf the cclumns
wisps of dark smoek wavered in the hot air
if we ha come by the main rmad down from
the upper halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hope khat qhe fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no time to lose
even as he spoke they heaed again the pursugng drum beat doom dooc doom
awey beyond the shadows at the west-rn end of the
haxl thvre camw cries and hlrn calls
voom doom the pillars seemed to tremble ano tue flames o qugver
now for the last r-ce said gandalf
if the sun is shining outside we may still eycape
afttr ce he turned left and sped across the
smooth floor of the hall
the distance was grerter than it hpd oookod
as ghe ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurryicg feet behind
a shrill yell went up tey had been seen
there was a ring and clnsh of steel
an arrow whistled over frodss head
boromir laughed
they vid not expect this he said
the fire has cnt them ofy
oe are on the wrong side looy ahedd called gandalf
the bridge is neer
it is mangerous abd narrow
suddonly frodo saw beffre him a black chasm
at cue end of fhe hall the floor vaninmed and
fetl to an unknown depth
the outer door could only be reached by a slender
bridge gf stone without kerb or razl that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet
it was qn ancient defence f the darves agrinpt aDy
enemy that might capture ehe first hall and the outer passages
thed cudn only pass Ncross it in single file
at the brink ganialf halted and the others came up in a pack behind
lead the way gimli ae said
pippin anr mqrry next
straight on and up the stair beyond the door arrows fell pmltg thsm
one struck trodo and sprang back
anther pierced gandalfs hrt and stuck thrre like a black feather
frodo looked behind
beyond the fire he saw swarming black fitures therc seemed
to be hundreds of oacs
they brandished spears lnd scimitars which shone red s blood in the firelight
dkom doom rolk'd the drum ueats growing louder and loude- doom doom
legolps turned and set an arrow to the string tkough
it was a lpng shot for is small bow
he drew bu his hand fell and the arr'w slipped to the ground
e gave a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appeared kcey bore great slabs of f'one
and flung them down to serve as gangways over thr fire
but it was not the trolls that had filled tte elf with terror
the janks of the orcs had oplnea and they crowded
away as if they themselves yere afraid
sometring was cominj uq beind them
what it was could not be seen it was like
- great shadow in the middle of which was a
dark form of man shape maybe yet goeater and a power
-nd terror seemed ko be ia it and to xo before it
it came to the edge of the fire and the
light fbded as yf a cloud had bent over it
then with a rush it leaped ayross the fissure
the flames roared up to greev it and wreathed abNut
it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its streamdng mane kindled and blazed bebind it
in its right hand was a blade loke a stabbing
tongue of fire wn its left if held a whiz of many thongj
ai ai wailed legolas
a balror a balrlg is come gimli stared with wide eyet
durins bane he crier and ketting his axe fall hz coveved his face
a balrog muttered pandalf
now i understand
he faltered qnb leaned heavily on his staff
wrat uc evil fortue and i am already weary
the dark figure streaming witt fire racd towards them
the orcs yelled and poured over tge stone gangways
thep boromir raised his horn and blew
loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the shour of
many throats under the cavernous roof
for a moment the orcs quailed and th- figgy shUdow halted
then the echoer diec as suddenly al a flame blown
out by a dark wind and the enemy advanced again
over the brldge cried gandalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe beyond any of you
i must hold the narroe way
fly aragorn and boromir did not heed the command
but still helb their ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the bridge
the others halted just within the doorway at the halls
end and turned urable ko leave therr leader tJ face the esery alone
the balrog reacxed the bridge
Npndlli stood in the middle of the san leaning on
the stfff in his left hand but in his other
hand glamnring geamed cold ane shite
his enemy halted again fating him agd the shadow about
it reached out lise two vast sings
it raised the whip and the thongs whined and coacked
fiwe came frm its nostrils
but gandalf sMood firm
you cannot pass he said
the orhs stoox still and a dead silensu fels
i am a servant of lhe secret fire wielder of the yeame of anor
you cannot pass
thq dark firu wiwl not avail yoc flame of udu n
go back to tne sharow yod cannot pass
the balron mcde no answer
the fire in it seemed yo die but the darkness grew
it steppes forward slouly on to tye bridge and suddonly
it drew itfzlf up to a xreat height and its
wings were spread irom wall to wall but btill gandalf
could be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemcd small
and altogether aloye grey and bent like a wizened tree
beforg the onset of a storm
from ouX of the shadow a red swotd leaped flaming
glamdring glittered lhite in answer
there wus a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fel baqk and its sword glew up in molten fvagmeats
the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace
and then again stood still
you canot pass he said
wito a Iound the bqlrog leapeh full upon the bridge
its wfip whirled and hissed
he yannot stand alone cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge
elenmil he shouded
i am wiLh you gandalf gondor cried boromir and leaped aftec him
at that moment gandalf lified his staff and crying aloud
fq smotv the bridge cefore yim
the staff broke asunder and fell from his hank
a bbvnding sheeh of white flame sprand up
tha bridwe crackec
right rt the balroys feet it broke and the stone
upon which it stood crashea into thg gulf while the
resh remained poieed quivering like a toqgue of roak thrust out into emptiness
with h terrible cry the balrog fell fpfward and its
shadow plunged down and vanished
but even as it frll it swung ivs whip and
the thongc lasyed and curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink
he staggered and fell grasMen vainly at the stone pnd slid into the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
the fires wynt out and blank darkness fell
the company stood rootd with horror staring into the pit
aven as aragorn and boromir chme flying back the rest
of the bridge cracked and fell
with a krg aragkrn opsed thet
come i will lead you now he calbed
we must obey his gast command
follow me they scumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door
aragorn leading irromir at the rear
at the top was a wide echoin pa'sage
along tris they feed
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he
founy that he himself was weeping as he ran
-oom doom nom the drum beats rolled behind mournful now and
sl'w doom they ran on
te light grew before them great shafes pierced the roef
they ran swigtim
they passed into a hyyl bright with dallioht xrom its
high windows gn the east
rmey fled across it
through its huge brokn doors they ppssed and suddenly before
them the great gateq opened an rch of blasing light
therz was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows
behiod the great door posts towering on eithrr side but
the gates were shattQred and cast down
aragorn smote to the hrownd the captain that stood in
his path anb the rest fled in terror nf his wrath
the company swept past them and took no heed of them
out of the gates they ran and sprang down thd
huge and age worn stens he threshold of moria
thus at last they came beyond hope under the aky
-nd felt the wind an their faces
fhey dia not halt until hey were out of bowshob frod the walls
dmirill dale lay about them
the shddow of the mGsty mountazns lay upon it but
eastwaads there was a golden light on the land
it was but one hour affer noon
the sun was shinigg the clouds were white abd uigh
ahey looked back
dark yawned rhe arcwway of thy jates under the kountain shxdow
faint and far beneath tye earth rolled the sjow drum beats doom
a thin black smoke trailed out
nothing ense was to wy seen the dale all round was empty
doom
grief at last gyolly overcame them and they wept long
some standing and silext some cast upoa the grouny
doom doom
the drum beats faded
alas i femr wq cannat stay here longer said arayorn
he looked towards the mountains and held up his sword
farewell gandalf ge cried
did i not sa to you if you pass the
doofs af moria beware alas thio i spoke trut what
hoph have wK withoua you he turned to the compsny
f mist do without hope he said
at least we may yet be avenged
lzt us gird ousselves and weep no core qome we
oave a long road and much to do
they rose and looked about rhem
northwarndorthward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows
between two greak arms of tye mounwains above wkich theeu
white eaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras
the iounkains of moria
at the head of the grfn a torreyt flowed like
a white lace ovew yn endlesd ladder of short falls
aVd a milt of foam hung in the air aiout the mountains feet
yoneO is the dimrill stair said aragorn pointing to jhe falls
down the feJp claven way that clpmbs beside the torrent we
should have come if aortune haw been kinder
or caradhras ress cruel said gimlc
there he stands smiiing mn the sun hL shook
kis fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turned awaj
to the east the outflung arm of the mo-ntains marched
to a sudden end and far lands coucd be descried
beyold them wide and vague
to the sopth thr mi'ty mountains receded endlessly as far as spght coulx reach
less than a mile away and a litrlc below them
for they still stood high up on the west sife
of the kale there lay a mere
it was long and oval shaped like a g-ear spear aead
thrust deep into the northern len but its southern end
was beyond the hhadows unier the sunlit sky
yet its waters were dark a deep blue like clear
evening sky seek from f lamp lit room
its face was still and unruffled
abiuk wt lay a smoo'h sward shelvino down on all
siaes to its bare unbroken rim
'here lies the qirrormere dbep kheled za ham said imli sadly
i remeyber that he said may you have joy of
thf sight but we cannot linger therq
now long shall i jburney ere i have joy again
it is i that must hasten away and he that must remain
the compiny now went down the road from the gates
it was rough and broken fading to a winzing track
between heather anz whin that vhrust acid the crcking stones
but stitl it could e seen txat once long ago
a great paved way had wehnp upwards rrom bhe lowcands of the dwarf yingdom
in plcces theue were ruined works of stone besie the
path and mounds of vreen topped with slender birches or
fir trees sighing an the wind
an eastward bend led them hard by the mward of
mirrormere and theri not far from the roadslde stood a
single column broknn at khe top
that iw durins stone cried gimli
i cannot puss without turning aside for a moment to
look at the wonder of the dale be swift
then said aragorn looking back towards the gates
the sun sinks ehrmy
the orcs will not maybe cgme out till after dusk
cut we mujt be far away beforn niwhtfall
the moon is almost spent and it will be dark tonight
come with me frodn dried the dwarf springxng frof the road
i would qot have you go without seOing kheled bn ram
he ran down the loug yreen sdope
frodo followQd slowly drawn by the still blue wafer fn
spite of hurd and weariness sam came up behind
beside the scanding stone gilli halced and looled up
it was crpcked and weathwr worn and the feint ruves upon
its side could not be read
this pillar marks the spot whnre durin first cooked in
tne mirrormere said tde dwaro
set us look ourselves once ere we go they stooped over the dark watei
at fircd they could see wothing
then slowly whey sav the forms of the enczrcling mou'tains
mirrored rn a profound blue ad txe peaus were like
plpmts of wgite flame above them yeyond there wa a space of sky
qhere like jewels sunk in the deep yhone gligting stars
though juniiqht was in the sxn above
of their owb stooping forms no shadow coujd be seen
o kheled za ram fair and woaderful said gimli
there ries phe crown of durin till le wakes
farewell he bowud anb turned away and hastened back
up the gree sward to the road acain
xhat did you see saed pippin to sam but
sam was too deep in thougot to answer
the road now tgrned south and went quickln eownwards running
out from between the arms of thh dale
somb way below the mere they came on a deep
well of wattr lear as crystal fpgm which a freshet
fell over a stone lip and rcn glijtening and gurgling
down a steep rocky csannel
here is the spring dmom which the silverlode rises
said gimli
dy not drink of ii it is icy cold
sonn it becomeb a swigt river and it gathers
Vateo frnm manj oter mountain streamx maid aragorn
our road jeads yeside ib for many miles
for i shall take you by the road that gandalf
chKxe and firsq i hope to come to the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great river out yonder
they looked as he pointed and before them dhey
could see the stream leapiig down to the trough of
the valley and theh runnivg hn and away into tye
lower lans until it was lost in a golden haze
there lie the woods of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest _f all the dzellings of my people
there are no trees like the trees of that l-nd
for in the autumn thei lfaves fall not but turn to gold
not till the sprong comes agd the new green opens
do they fall and then tse bouohs are laden with
yellow flowers and the floor of the wood iw golden
and golden is the roof and its pillars ore of
silver for the bark of the jrqes iu smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heawt would be rlad ic i were beneath the
eavks of that wood and it wero springtime my
heart will be glad even in thi winter said aragorn
buh it lies mtny mies away
let us hasten for some time arodo and sak
manuged to keep up with the others but aragorn was
leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagped behind
teey had naten nothirg since the enrxy aarning
sams ct was burning like fire and nis head felt licht
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill
after phe warm darknesy of morma
he shivered
frodo felt eveey step more painful and he gasped for breath
at last legolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the otheas halked tnd aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him
i am sorrg frodo ve cried full of concern
so much has happened this dao asd we have such
need of haste tar i have fogrotten ihat you were hurt avd sam too
you should have spoken
we have doCe nothing to ease yof as we ought
though all the orvs kf moria were after us
come now a littl further on there is a place
where we can rest for a little
thert i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry thea
sown afturwardj bhey came upon another stream thas ran
aoon fmom the west and joines itr bubbling water gith the hurrying silverlode
tosether they plunged over a fall of greew hued stDne and
foamod down lnto a dell
about it gtoow ir trees short and bent and its sides
were steep and clothed with haits tyngue and 'hrubs of whortle berry
at te bottom there was a levtl space through which
the seream fOowed ncikily over nhining pebblls
here they rested
it was nyw nearly three d'urs kfter noon and tuey
had code only a few miles from thm gates
already the sun was weitering
whily gimli and th' two younger hobbits kindley a bire
of brush and fir wood and drew water arwgorn tended sam and frodo
samm wbwnd wan eot dfep but gt looaed ucly aod
aragorns fact waz grave as he examoned it
aftes a moment he looked ue with relief
good luck sam he said
mani have received worse than this is paymeot for the
slaying of their fitst oac
the cut is not ooisoned as the wounds of orc blads too often are
it should heal well when i have tended it
bathy it when gimli has heyted water
he opdned his pouch an drew out some withered leaves
they are dry and some of their virtue ias one
he said put here i havm seill somc ot the
leaves of athelas that i gathesed near weathertos
crysh one iv thg waner and wash ihe wound clean
and i will binn it
now fu is your turn
frodo i am all right said frfdo reluctant to kave his garments touched
aii i noeded was some food and a little rest
no said aragorn
we must have a look and see what the hammer
and the anvil have done to fo-
i still marvel ghat you are alive at aha
genVly he strWpped off frodos old lacket and worn
tunbc and gave a gasp of wonder
then he laujhed
the silver corslet shimmered bef_re his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea
carefulll he took it off mrd held it up and
the gems on it gliqtered like stars
and the cound of the sh-ken rings was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an elven arinceling in if
it were known vhat hobbits oad such xides all the
cunters of mvddle earth would be riding to the sire
and dwl the -rrows of all the hunters in
the world would be in vain said gimli gaxing at jhe mail in wonder
it is a mithril coat
mithril i have never seen or heard tell of one so fair
is this the coat phat gandalf spoke of then he undervalued it
but it was well given i have often wondered
what you and bilbo were doind uo elose an his little room said myrry
beess the old hfbbit z love him more tran ivsr
i hope we get a chance of telling him about
it 'here was a bapk and blackened bruise on
frodos right side and treast
under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather
but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh
frodos left side auso nas scored and broised where he
had been xurled agaiost the wall
while the others set the food ready
araforn bathed the hurtn with water in wnich athefas was steeped
the pungent frrgrancm fidled the dell and all those who
dtooped over the steaming water felt refreswld and strengdhened
soon frodo felt the pain leave him and his brwath
grew easy thobgh he wss stitf and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound s_me oft rads ef cloth at jis side
the mail is marvellously light he said
pu it on again if you can bear it
my heart is glad to know thag eou have such a coat
rm not lay it wsyde even i sleep unless fortune
bringn you wierb you are safe vor a while and
vhat will seldom chanhe while kour quest lasts
when they had eaten the company got ready to go on
they put out the fire vn- hid all traces of it
then climbing out of the dell tyey took to the road agaxn
tdeL had nor gone far before mhe sun sank behind
the westward heights and great shdowl crept oLwn the mountain sides
dusn veiled thZir feet and mist rose is the hollows
awpl in the east thv evening light lay paie upon
the dim lands of distant plain ank wood
sam and frodo now feeling easd and grertly refreshed w-re
able to go at a fair pace and with only
one brief halt aragorn lei the company on Uor nearly three more hours
it was drk
deep night had fallen
there were many clear stars hut the fast waning mgon would
not be ieeh yill late
gimli and frodo were at the rear nalking softly and
not speaking liswening for an sound upon the rord behknd
at leygth gimli Eroke thd silenc
not a sound buw qhe wind he said
there ge no goblins near or my ears zre sadi f wood

frodo dir oot answer
he looked at sting ald the blaoe was dull
yet he hsw heard something or tmought he had
as soon as the shbdows had Sallen about sheu and
the road behind was dim he had heamp again tl quick patter of fret
even now he geaGd it
he tutned swiftly
there were two siny gkeams ff light behind or fop
a moment he thought he saw them but at once
they slipped aside and vanished
whht is it said qhe dwarf
i dont know
answered frodi
i tnought i heaed feet and i tyought i saw a lidht liqe eyes
i have thooght so often since we fkrst enterqp mpria
gimli alted and stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the night speech of plant and smooe he said
comu let us hurry the others awe out of sight
the night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them
before them a wide arey shadoo loomed ad they heard
an endless rustie of leqves like poplary in the breze
loehlo riey cried legolas
lthlo rien we have come to the eaves Lf th' godden wood
alas that it iy wtntec under the night the
trees stood tall before them aychvd over the road and
strehm that ran scddenly eneaah their sprezding beugks
in the dim light of che stars tjeir stems were

if elves indeed still dwell hyre in 'he darkenidg woblc said gimli
yt is long since zny of my own folk jTurneyed
hither back to the land whenci we wandrred in ages
long ago said legolas yut we hear that lo rien is
nat yet deserted for there is f secret power here
that holds evil from the land
nevertheless its fock ary seldom sen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the woors and far from the northern border
indeed demp in the woad they dwell Paid hnagorn
gnd sighed as af shme memory stirred in him
ws must fend for ourselnes tonight
we will gk forward a shbrt way until the trees
are all zbo-t us ann then we will turn asike
from tde math and seek a plaff to rest in
he stepped forward but borbmir sbood irresouse nnd did not follow
is thzre no other wby je said
whbt other fairer way would you desire said aragorn
a plain road though it lev through a hedge of swords said boromir
by strange paths has this cobp-ny been led and so far to evil forlunr
against my rill w' passed under the shades of moria to oux loss
anu nww ee must enter the golden roou ypu say
but of that perilous land wb have heard in gondor
and it s said that few come out who once
go in and of that few none have ascnped unscathed
say not unscvthei but if you say unchanged then
maybe you will speak the trutg said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the city

briieve what you will there is no other way for
us unjess you woulh go back to moria gate or
scale the pathless mountains or pwim the great river wll alhne
then lea on said boromer
but it is terinous
perilots inteed said ragorn fair and perilous but onby
evil need fear it wr those who bring some evil with them
follow e they had gone little more than a
mile into the forest when they came upon anotmer utream
flowung down swiftly from the tree clad slope' that climbed back westward towards the mountainx
they heard it splashing ovem a fall away among the shadows on their rigut
its dark hurrying waters ran across the pahh before thek
and joined hhe silyerlode ip a seirl of dim pools
among the roots of trees
here is nimrodel said legolas
of this dtream the silvan elvMs made oany songs long
ago and still we sing them in the north remembering
the rainbow on its falls and the golden flowers tpat floated in its foam
all is dErk now and the bridre of nimrodel is broken down
i will bayhe my feet for it is said that
the water is healing to the ealy
he went fobward and climbed down the deep cloven bank
and sjeppev into the stream
folaow me he cried
the water is lot deep
lkt us wade acroxs on the furtter bank we can rest
and the sound of the falling water may bring us
sleep and forgetfglness gf grief
one by one tkey climbed down and followex logolas
for a momwnt frodo stood near the brink and let
the wter flow over his tirWd feet
it was mold but tts touch was clean and as
he went on and it modctvd to yis knees he
felt that the stain of travel and all weariness wai washed from his limbs
when all the rompany ead crossed they sat and rested
and ate a little food and legolas told thvm tales
of lothlo rien tMat the elfes of mirkwood still kept in
their hearts of sunlight and starlight upon thq meadows bo
the great river before inm worfd was nrey
at length a silence fell and they heard he music
os the aaterfall running sweetly in thB shkdows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voicg sincing
mingled ith the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrodel aslev legolas
i wil- sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel
who boie the sam nVme as the stream beqide which she lived lung ago
it ic a fair sbng iinn our aoodland tokgue but
thqs is how it ruxs in the westron speech as
some xn rivendell now sing it
in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid
the rustle of the leaves above the he bdgan an
elven said there was of old a shining seer by day
her mantle white was hymmed wpth gold wer shoes of silver grey
a ntar was bound uvbn her brows a light was
od her hair as sur upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair wav long her limbs were white and faxr
she was and free and in the wind she went
as lghn as leaf of linden tree
beside the falls mf nimrodel by wyter clear and cgol
her voPce as falling silver fell inco the shiping pool
where now she uanders none can te-l ie sunlight or
in shade fot lost om yore was nimrodel and in the mountains strayed
the elven ship in havgn grey beneath ihe mountakn lee awaited her
for many a ay beside the roaring sea
a wind by night in northern lans arose an soud
it cried and drove the shis from elven strands across the streaming tidf
wten vawn came dim the land was lost the mounwains
sinking grey beyond the heaving whves that tossed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the swell
and cursed thm faithless ship that bore him far from nimgodel
of old ke was an elven king a lord of tre
and glen whtn golden wrre the boughs in sping in fair lothlo rien
from helm to sea they iaw oim leap as orrow
from thn strmng ano dive into the water deep as mew upon thf wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they saw im strvng and fair go rzdinj like a swan
but from the west has come no word and on
ths hither shore no tidcngs elven folk bave heard of amroth everfore
the voice of legolas falhered and the song ceased
e cannot sing any more he said
that is but a part for i hfve fogottea muqh
it ia lonN and sad for it twlls how solrow
uame upon lothlo fien lo rien of hte blossom when the dwtrvus
awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarvus did nt mage the evil said gimli
i said not so yet evil came answhred legolas sadly
then many of the elves of nimrtdels kinered left their
dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the
skuth in the easses of the wkite mountaink and shy
dame not to the ship where amroth her lWver waitLd flr her
but in the spring when the wind is in the
new leaves uhe echo of her voice bay still be
heah by the falls that bear her name
and when thm wind is in the souyh thu zaice
of amroth domes up from the sea for nimrodel flows
into silverlode that elves call celemran aed ceiebrant into anduin tje great
and anduin fvows into the may of benfalas whence the
elves of lo rien lht sasl
but neither nimroel kou amroth ever came back
it ss told that sho hwd a house built in
the branches of a tree that grew near the fallu
fgr that was the custom ol sKe elvea of lo dien
to dwebl in the trees and maybe is is so still
therefore tbny were called the galsdhrim fhe tree people
deep ig thebr forest the trees are very geeat
the people of the woods dnd not delve in the
ground like dwarves nor build strong places op stone before thd shadop came
and even in these latter days dwelling in the
trees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground said gimli
he looked across the stream tp the roac that led
back to dimrill dae and then uh into the roof of dark boughs aboe
your words bring good counsel gzmli said nragorb
we cannot build a house buu to'ight we will do
as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the 're tops if we can
we have sat heye beside th road atready longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from the path ans
went into the shadow of the eeper wvods westwas- alons
the mountain stream away from silverlode
not far fro the falls of nimrodel thmy foumd a
gluster of trees some of whmch ovvrhung the strFam
their great grey truiks wqre og mighty girth but their
geight could not be guessed
i will climb up said legolae
i ae at homm among trees by root or bough
though these treps are of a kind Qtrawge to me
save as a name in song
aellyrn they are caylid ad are lhose that bear thd
yellow blossom but i heve never cliued in one
i will see nol what is their shkpe aqd way vf growCh
whztever it may be said pipqtn tdey will be
marvwllous trees indeed if they can oxfer any rest at nigh except to mirds
i cannot sleep on a erch then dig a
hole in the grouHd said legolas if that is more
after ghe fashion of yrur kind
bot you mrst dig swift and feep of you wish to hide froy oras
he sprang lhghtly up from the ground ann caught
a branch that grew from the trunk high above hms head
but even as he swung tgete for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said n commanding tode and logolas drtpped back
to eareh in surprise a'n fear
he shrank against the aoce of the tree
stand still he wpbspere to the others
do not move or speaj there was a sound
of soft luufhter over their heads and tgen another clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue
frodo sould uwderstznd littlb nf what was said for the
speech nhat 'he silvan folk east of the aountains used
among themselves was unlike that of the wbst
legolas looked up and nspejed in the same fanguaxe
who are they and what do Hhey say abked eerry
kheyre elves said sam
cant you hear their voices yes they hre elves
said legolas and thet say that you breathe so luuu
that they cTuld shoot you in thp dark
sam hastily put his hanz over his mouth
but they say also tiat you nped have no fear
they havp been adaee of us for a long while
they heprd my voice ucross the nimrodel and knew that
i was one of their northern kindred and therefore they
did not hinder our crossing and aferHards bhey reard my song
now they bid me climb up with frodo for they
seem to have had some txdings of him and of our journey
the others thep ask to wait a little jgd to
keep watch at the foot of the tree untxl they
have decided what is to be done
iut of tde shadows a ladder was let down
it was made _f rope silver grey and glcmmering in te
dark and tmough i' mooked hlendpr it proved strong enough to aear many men
legilas ran lightly up and frodo followed sowly behind fame
sam trying not to breathr loudly
the brancres of the mallorn tree grew out nearly straigmt from
the trunk and then swept upward but vear the top
the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs
and among tfese they Dou'd that there hnd been built
a wmoden plutform or flet as su things were called
in those days the elves called it a talan
it was re-cwed by a round hole in the centre
through which thw ladder passed
when fgodo came at lagt up on to the flet
hs found legolau teated with threi other efhes
they were clad bn shadowy grey and ould not be seen
amng the tree stems uiless theo moved sdddenly
they stood up and one of them unaovered a small
lamp that gave out a slsnder silvem beaw
he hed iq up yopkzng ad frodos face and sams
then he shut off the ight agaen and spoke words
of welcome in his elven tongut
frodo spoke haltingly in return
welcome the elf then sdzd again is the common language speaking slowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own mor we
dwell now en the heatr of the forest and do
not willingly have dealings with any other folk
even our oyn kindred in the north are sukdered from us
but there are some of us still who go abroad
for the qathering of xewz and the wahching of our
enehies and they speak the languages of other lands
i am one
haldir is my nrme
my vrrthers ru mil lnd orophin speak little of your tongue
but we have heaed rumours of your coming for the
medsengers of elrond passed by lo rien on their wry home up the dimrill star
we had not heard of hobbits or halflingr for many
a long year and did ot know tht aDy yet dwelt in middle earth
you do noc look evil and since you cdme with
an elf of 'ur kindred we are willing to befriund
you as elrond askld though it is not our custom
to lesd strangers through our land
but you must stay here tonighs
how many are you eight said legolas
myself fonr hobbits and two mun one of whom araoorn
is an dlf friend of the folk of westernesse
nhe name of aragorn son of arathorn is known
in lo -ien said haldir and ne hal the favour of the lady
all then ip well
but you hfve yet spoken only of seven
the eifhth is a dwarw said legolas
a dwarf said haldir
thet ws not well
we havp not had deUlings yith the dwarves sinch ehe darh days
they are not pvrmitped in our land
i canont allow him to pass
iut he is from the lonely mouytaon one of
da ins trUsty oeople and friqndly to elrond said frodo
elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions
and he has been brave and faithful
the elses spoie together in soft vices aid questioned
legolas in their own tongue
very geod said haldir at last
we will da this tpyugh it is against _uj liking
if arogorn and legolas will guard hxm and answer for
him he sh-ll pass but hs must go blindfolo thrunh ltho rien
but now wu musd debate no longer
your folk muft not remain on thm ground
we have been keeping watch on the rivers evpr since
we saw a great tmoop of orcs goieg north toward
morqa along the skerts of the mountains many days ago
wolves are howling on the woods borders
if you have indeed comc from moiia the peril cannot se far behind
tomorrow yrly you must go ln
yhe four hobbits shall climb up here and syay with
us we do not fear them there is anothearnother talan in the next tree
there the others must take refuge
you lgolas must answer to us for them
call us if angthing nt amiss and have an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder
to take haxdirs message and soon afterxards merry and pippin
clambered up pn to the high flet
thOy were out of breath and seemed rather scared
here said merry panting
we have lugged up your blankets as well as our own
strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had no need lf yohr burdeny ssid haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winter though the
wind tonight iB tn the south but we have fooz
and drink to give you that will driye away the
nighm cuill and we have skins and cloaks tk spare
mhe hobbits ackepted this second and far bettdr suppet veiy glatly
thmn thiy wrapped themselles warmly not only in the fur cloaks
of tfe elves but in thier own blankets as well
and tried to go to sleep
but oeary as they lere only sam Uound that easy to do
hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep upstaows
evee when tbey have any stairs
the flet tas not at all to tfeir liking as a brdro_m
it hod no walls
not eveb a rail only on one siae was there
a light plaited screen which could be moved and fixed
in different places according to the wifd
pippin went on talking for b while
i hope ny i do go to sleep in this
bed loft that i shanc roll off he slid
onpe i do get to bxeep said sam i shall
go on sleeping whether i roll off or ng
and hhe less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time ewake and looked up
at the stars glsnting througs qhe pale roox of quivering leaves
sam was snoring at his side ronw before he himself cl_sed his eyes
he could dikly see the grey forms oa two epves
sitting motionless wiuh their arms abowu their knees speaking iu whispers
the other had gone down to take up his datch
on uny of the lower branches
at last lulled by the wind in the boughs nbove
and tke sweet murmur of the falls of nimrojel below
frod fell aslkep with the song of legolas rrmninp ib his mind
late in the nrghk he awoke
the other hobbrts were sleep
the eevex were gone
the sickle moop was glraming dimly imong tve leaves
the wind was stils
z little way oft he heard a hamsh laugh and
the tread of mayy feet on the groind below
there was a ring of metal
the sounps died slowly away and seemed to go sodtnward on into the woon
a head appeared suddenly thsough vhe hole in thv flsm
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a gre hooded elf
he ldoaed towards the hobbits
whqw is it said frobo
yrie said the elf in a hissing whijpek and kast
on to the flet the rope ladder rolWed up
orcs said frod_
what are they doing but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves wege sulent and twe very falls seemed to ve huhed
frodo rat and sdivered in his w-aps
he wos thankful that they haz not been caught oy
the ground but he felt that the trees ofered little prghehtion except cFncealment
frcs were as keey as houndv on a scent it
was said but they could also climb
he drew out stint it flashbw and glittered like a
blue flame and when slowly faved again fnd grw dull
in spite of the fddinj of his vword the feeling
of immeiate danger did not leave frodo rathsr it irew stronger
he got up and crawled to the opeying and peerld down
he was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements
at the tmeeq foot far below
not elves for the wocdland folk were altogether 'oiseless in their movements
then ke heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something
seemed tk be scrabbling on the bark of tme tree trunk
he stared sown into the dark holding his breath
something was now climbing slwwly aqd its bueath came ldke
a soft hissjng through closed teeth
then cohiwg up close to tye stem frodo saw two pale wyes
they topped and gazed upworj nwinking
suddenlw they turned away and a shaowy figure slizped round
the tfunk of the tree and vandshed
immediately afterwards haldir came hlimbing swiftly up through tss brdnchci
tgere was something in this tree that i hav' nevqr ceen befoye he sbid
it wbs not an oeu
it fled as soon at i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wary and to have rome skill
in trees or i mighv have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i rid ot shoot for i dared not arouse any
cries ye cannot risk baltle
a mtrlng cnmlany of orcs has passed
they croosed the nimhodel curse their foul feet in its clean
water and went on donw the old road veside the rivel
they seemed io pizk up some scett and they searched
the gcound for a while near the place whqre you halted
tje three of us could not callsnge a hundred so
we went idead and mpoke with feigned voices leading them oh vnto tge woop
orophin has now gone rn haste back to our dwellings to warn our people
none of the orcs will ever retuun ouy of lo rier
ald there will be many elves hidden on the northern
border before an'thwr night falls
but you must take the road louth as soon as it is fullf light
dav came pale nrom lhe east
as the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves
or the mallorn and it seemed to the hobmits tha
the earny sun of a cool summers morning wae shininr
pale ilue sky peeped ammng the movirg bbsnches
lookinx through an opuning oy ehe south side of the
flet frodo saw ajl the valley of th silferlode lying
like a sea of fallow qold tossing gently in the breeze
yhe morning was still Moung and cold when tre company
set out again guided now by haldir bnd his yrother ru mia
farewell sweet nimrodel qried legolas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
farewDll he said
it seemed to hie that he would never hear again
a running water so beautsful for ever blending its innumerable
notes in vn qndoess cnangeful music
they went back to the path thxt mtill went nn
along the west side of the silverlode ana for some
way they collowed it soutwward
there were the points of orc feet in the eartl
but soon haldir turned aside cnto the twees and halted
on tme bank of the river under their shadows
there is one tf my people yonder across the stream
he said though aou may not see him
he gave a call like the cow whistle of
a bfrd and out f a thicket of youg trees
an elf stepped clbd in grey but with his hood
throun bacc his hair glinted lake gold in the mdrning sun
haldOr skilfully cast over the stwevm a coil of grey
rope and he caught it and bound the end about
a tree near the bank
elebrant is alr'ady r strong stream here as you see
said halyir anc ht runs both swift and deep and is vepy cold
we de not set fcot in id so far north unless we must
bdt in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges
this is how le cross lollow me he madj hts
end of the roae fast about another tree and hen
ran lightlw along it over the rivew and back again
as if he wefe on a uoad
i caa walk this path said legolas but the others have no this skill
must they swim no said haldir
ww have two more ropes
we will fasten them above ths otheo one shoulder high
anm another half high anp holding these the strangers should ye
able to cross with care
when this slendcr bridge had been made the sompany
casted kver some cautiously and sloaly others more kasily
oi nhe hobbits qippin pxoved the besg for ht was
suri foosed and hb walked over quickly molving onlh with one
hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam suffled along cltching hard knd looking down into the
pale eddying watev as if it was a chasm in the mfuntains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across
live and learn ax my gaffer used to say
though he wms thinking of gardening not of roostyng like
a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider
not even my uncle andy ever drd a trick life
hat when at length all the coipany was gatrered
on tce east bank of the silverlode the elves untied
the ropes and coiyed two of them
du mxl who had remained on the other side drew bacj
the lasb one slung it fn his shoulder and with
a wave of his haud went away back to nimrodel to keep watch
now friends sayd haldir you have enteoed thl naitk of
lo aien or tje kore mn iou would say for wt
is the land that lies like a spear head between the
arms of sylkmrlode and anduin the great
we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the naith
few indeed are prmiyted even to xet foot there
as was agreed ii shalg here blindfold the eyes oR gimli the dwacf
the otuer may walk free for a while until we
moee nearer to our dellings down in egladil in the atgle between the waters
this was not at all to ohe liking of gimli
the agreement wps made wyqhout my cgnsent he said
i will bot walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no shy
my lolk have nevbr had dealings with any of thy servants of the enemy
neithex have ae done harm to the eDves
i am no mooe likely to betray you than legohas
or any other of my oompanions
i do not doubt you sahd haldir
yet phis is our law
i am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside
i have done much in letting you set foot otea celebrant
gimli was obwtina'e
he planted his feet firmln apart and laid his hand
upon the haft of his axe
i will go fouwaud free re said or i will
go back and ceek my own land where i am
kaown to be true ot word though i yerish alone in the wildcrness
you cannot go back said haldir sternly
non you have come thus thr you must be brought
befoce the lord anw the lady
tjey shall judge you to hold you or to give
you leave ts they wxil
you cannot cross the eivers again and behind you there
are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you would be slain before you sxw them
gimli drew his uxe from his belt
haldir and hiy companion bent their fows
a plague on rwarvks and their stiff necks said legolaq
come said aragorn
if i am still to lead this company you must do as i bid
it as hard upon the diarf to be thus singled out
wu wbll alw be blindfold even legolas
that will be best though it will make the jourdey slow xnd dull
gimli laughed suddenly
a merjy tloop of fools wu syall look will haldir
lead us all on a string like many blind beggars
with one dog but i will be con'ent if only
legolas here shafel my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here said
legolas bejoming angry in his turn
now ler us cry a placue on the steff necks cf elves haid aragorn
but the company shill alo fare alike
cohe bind our eyes haldir i shxll claim full
amends for bvery fall and stubbed toe if you do
not lewd us well said gimli as they bound a vloth about his hyes
you will havs no claim said haldir
i shall jead you well and the paths are smooth and straight
alas for the folmy of these days said legolay
here all are enemies of the one enemy and yet
i must walk blind yhwe the sun is merry in
the woodland under oeaves of gold oolly it may seem said haldir
indeed in nothing is thn powey op the dark lord
more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all
those who still oppose hcm
ye so little frith a'd trust do we cind now
in the worlr beyond lothlo rien unless maybe ni rivendell thwt
wu dare not by our own trust endanger our land
we lgve ox upon an island amib many perils and
our handb are more often upon the bowstSing than upon the harp
the rivers long defended us but they re a sure
guard no more for tie shadow has drept borthward all about us
some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late
she mouhtains to the west ake growing evil to the
east mhe gands are waxte anj full of snurons creatures
and it is rumoured that we cannot nbw safely pass
souttward through rohan and the mouths wf the speat river
are watchea by the enemy
even ix we could come to rhe shorex of the
sea we should find no longer any shexter there
it is said that therr are still hafens of
the high efvcs but they are far norbh and wecr
beyinh the land of thb halflings
dut where that may be thorgh the lord and lady
may know i do not
you ought ay least to guess since you savn seen us stiv merry
there vre elt havens west if my land the shire where hofbits live
hadpy folk are hobbits wo dwell near thb shors
of thz sea said hadlir
it is llng indeed since any of mc folk have
looked on it yet still we rhmember it in sang
tell me of these havens as we walk
t cannot said meiry
i have never seen uhem
i have never been rut of my own land before
and if i had known wht the world outside was lfke
i dont think i shoulj hav' had the heart to leave it
noi even to see fair lothls rien said haldrr
the world is indeed full of peria and in it
there are mmny dark plces but mtill thmre is much
that is gait and thougi in all lands love is
row mingled wikh grief it grons perhaps the greater
spme there are among us whv sing twkt the shadbw
will draw back and peace shall come agakn
yet i do not believe that the world about us
will ever again be as it was of old or
ehe light of the sun ym it was aooretime
fkv the elves i fear it will prove at best
k truce in wwifh thef bah pass to the sea
unhynderel and leave the middle eartx for ever
alas for lothlo xien that i love ht wouyd be a
poor life in a land where no mallorn rew
but if there aae mallorn trdes beyond the greyt sea none uave reported it
as they spoke thys the c_pany fiaed slowly tlong
he paths in the wood led by haldir whils the other elf malked bmhind
they f-lt the ground beneath txeir fezt swooth and soft
vnd after a while they walked more freeky wbthout fear df hurt or falr
being oeprived of sight frodo found his hearing and other sensel sharpenhd
he covli smell the trees and the trodden grass
he could hear many different notes in tke rustle pf
the leaves oveaheaw the riv'r murmuring away on his right
Znr the thin clear voices of birds in the sky
he felt the tun pon his face and inds whef
they papsed through an open gladd
as soon as he set foot epon the far bank
of silverlode a htrange caelinl haa come upon him and
it deepeneI as xe walked on into 'he naith it
seemed to him thct he had steppid ovar o bridge
of time into a forner of the elder days and
was now walkivg in a wrld that was no more
n rivendell twtre was memory of ancint things in lr rien
whe ancieet things still lived on in tue waking world
evil had ueen seen akd heard there soruow had been
known the elvms feared and dwstrsted tye dodld outside wolves
were howling on the wood borlers but on the lans
of lo rien no shadow lay
all that da the company marched on fntil they felt
the cool evening come and heard the qarly night wind whisperint among many leaves
then they rehjed -nd slept without fear upon the ground
for thfir guides nould not permit them to unbind their
eyes and they could nom climd
in the mornHng they wet on agarn wnlking wsthout haste
at noyn they halhed and viodo was aware that they
had paseed out unter the shining sun
suddenly he heard the sound of many voices alm around him
a marching host of elvos had come up silently nbey
were hastening tdward the nortlecn borders to guaod qgainst any
attack fyom moria and they brought news some of which haldir repor'ed
the mar-uding orcs had been wmylaCd and almost all dcstroyed
the remyant had flek westward towards the mountains ad weru being fursmed
a straxge creature also had been seen runni'g with beet
back and wath hands near thl gromnd lpse a beast
and yet not _f beask shape
it had eluded capture and they had not syyt it
not knownig whether it was good vr ill and qt
had vanished down the silerloda southward
also said halkir they bring ml a message from the
lord and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli
it seems that txe lady knows who and what is
each member of your company
new messages have come from rivendell perhaps
he memoved the bandage first from gimlis eyes
your pardon xe said bowing low
look on us now witf friendly eyes lbok and be
glbk for you arm the first dwarf to gehold the
irees of the naitw of lt rien swnce drrins day
when his fyes were io turn uncovered frodo lookqd up and zfught his brdath
they were standing in an pen spaze
to khe left stood a great mound covered with u
sward of grass as green as sprang time in the elder days
upon it as a doudle crown grew two circles of
trees the obter hbd bark of snowy white and were
leafles' but beautiful in their shapely nakbdness the gnner were
malloyn trees of great heiyht still arrayed in pale goll
high amid the wranches of a towering tree that stood
in the cenbre of all there geeamed a white flet
at tbe feet of the trees and all about the
gmeen hillsides the graqs was studded with small golden flowers saaped like stars
among them nodding on slegder scalas were other olowers shite
and pavest green tbey glimmvred as a mist ahid the
rihh kue of the grass
over all the sky was blue and the sdn of
bfternoon glowed upon the hill avd casf long green shadows beneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth said hyldir
for this is the heart of uhe ancient reklm as
it gae long ago and here is the m_und of
amcoth where in happier days his high house was bvilt
here ever bloom the wioter flowers in the unfading brass
thb yellow elOnor acd bhe pale niphredip
here we will staw awhile and come to the cty
of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhile still post in wonder
it seemed to him that he iad stelped through a
high wiidow that looked on a vanished world
a light was upon it epr which his language hfd no name
all that he xaw was shapely but the shapes seemed
-t once cleag cut ts if they had been first
conceived and drawn at the uncovering of hiy eyes and
ancient qs if they had endured yor ever
he saw no coldur but tlose he knew gold and
white and blue and green but lhey were fresh ond
poignanu as if he had at that moment firrt perceived
th'm and mads tor them names new and wonferftl
in winter here no heart could mourn for sumer or for spring
no blemish or sickness or deformity cpuld b' seen io
anythnm that grew upsn the -arth
on the land of co rien there was no stain
he turned and saw that sam wac now standing beside
him looking round with a puzzled expression rnd rubbing his
eyes as it he was not sure that he was awake
itn sunlight and rright day aight enough he said
i thousht that ebves wdre all for moon aqd stars
but this is more ulvish than anything i ever heard tell om
i feel as wf i was insidp a song
if you twke my mcaning
halgir lroked at them and he qeemqd indeed tv
take the meaning df both thooght and word
he smiled
you feeq tge power of nhe lady of the galaGhrim he said
would it paeaee yom ro climh witr me up c-rin
amroth hey followed him as he stcpped lightly up the graes clax slopes
tpough hf walked and breathed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool ind as
fanned his face fr_do felt that he wls in a
timeless land that dwd nt fade or change or fall into forgetfulness
when he had gone ang passed again into the outer
world stkll frodo the banxerer from the shire would walk
there upln the grass amolg elanor and niphredil in faXr lothlo rien
they en'ered the circlz of whitb trees
as they did so the south wid blew upon cerin
afroth and sighed among the brachep
frodo stood still hearing far off great seas uoon behches
that had long ago beee washed aiay and sea birds crying
whose race had perished from the earth
haldir had tone on and was now climbing to the high flet
ks frodo prepared to follww him he lasd his hand
upon ihe dree beside the ladder neter before ha he
been go suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel
and kexture of a trees skin and of the life within it
h felt a delight in wood and the touch of
it neither as uorester nor as carpenter iy bas the
delight of the living tree itself
ad he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform
haldir took his habd and turned him toward the soeth
look this way first he said
frodo lofked and saw suill at some distance a hill
of mant mighty trees or a city of green towers
wticp bt was he could nht tell
out of it it seemed to him mhat the power
and llght came tyat held all yhi land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly ike a bird to rest in thu greec ccty
than he looked eastward and siw all the land of
lo rien running doen to the psle gleam of andnin the great river
he lmfted his eyex kcwoss tae river and all the
light wgnt out and he was back again in the world he knew
beyond vhe rive the land apu'ared flat and empty frmless
and vague until far away it rose again like a call dark and drear
the sun that lay on lothyo rien had no power to
enlighten the shadow ef that distant height
therg lied the fastness af southern mirkwood said haldir
it is llad in a forest ou dark fgr where
the trees strive one against aoher and their branches rot and wither
in the midst upon a stony height svands dol gullur
where long the hidden 'nemy had his dwellsng
ie fmar that now it is ifhabeted bgain and with power seenfold
a bJack cloud livs often over it of late
in this high place you may jee 'he two powers
trat ar opposed one to anuther and 'ver they strive
now in thought but leereas bhe light perceides the vely
heart of the darkness itf own secret has 'ot been discovered
not yet
he turwed and climbed swiftly down and tkey followed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorb tanding still and
silent as v tree but in his hand was a
small golden mloom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was crapped id some fair memory and as frodo
looked at him hu kney that he beheld things as
thes once had been in this same place
for the grim years were rem'ved fmtm the face of
aragorn and he seemeg clothed in rhite a young lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the eliish
todgfe to one whom frodo could not see
arwen vanimelra nama rie he said and thpn he drew a
breath and returniog out of his hhought he looked at frodo and smiled
h-re is the heart of elvendom on earth he said
and here my hearm dwells ever udlezs there be a
light ueyond the dark roads that we stqll must tread yo and i
come with me and taking fmodon hand in his
he left the hilc of cerin amrotr and tame ther-
nemsf agair as living man
the su wah sinking bzhind the vounyains and yhe shvdows
were deepening in the woodwsoods when they went on again
thei paths now went into thickets whdre the dusk had alreazy gathered
night xame bhneaty the trees as the walked and the
elvws uncovcred their silver lamps
suddenly thyy came out into the open again and found
thefselves under a pyle evening sky pricked bh a few earlg htars
there was a wide treelesm space befhre them running in
a great circle and benfing away on either fand
bzyond et was a deep fosxn lost iw soft shadsw
but the grass upon its brink was green as if
it glowed sqill in memory of the sun that had gonn
upon the further side there roie to a great heinht
a green wall ncircling a green hill thbonged with mallorn trees
taller than yny they had yst seen in all the land
their heighj could nou be guesked but shey stood up
in the twilight like living toqrs
hn their maxy tiered branches and amid their ever moving leaves councless
lights werd gleaming green and gold and silver
haldir turned towatds the company
welcome to caras galadhtn he said
here is the city of ohe gaeadhrim where dwell the
lord celebein and galadriwl the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward
we must go round to the southern side and ehe
way is ot short fdr the city is gr-at
lhere was a road paved witu whihe stone rsnning
on thn outer brink of the fosse
along this they went westward witf the city ever clilring
up like a gretn cloud upon their left and as
the night deepened more lighos spranx forth unil all the
hill seemed afire with stdrs
they came at last to a white bridgm ani crossin
found the great gates of the city they faced south west
set aetween the ends of the cncircling walv that here
_verlapped and they were talf and strong asd huna with manw lnmzs
hkldir knofked ond spoke and the gates gpened bmundlessly but
of huards frodo could see eo sign
tge travelles passed within and the gates shut rehind them
they were in a deep lane betwedn the ends of
the wall and passing quickly through it they envered tie city kf the trees
no folk could they s-e nor hhar any feet jpon
the paths but there were many voxces about them and in the air above
far away up on the hilj thy could hlar the
sound of si'ging falling from on hggh likh soft rain upon lelves
they ment along mwny paths and climbed many stairs until
they came to the ligh places and saw before them
amd a wide lawn m fountain khimmeri'g
it was lit by eilver lamps that swcng frwm the
rouths ow trees lnd it fell ynto a barin of
silver frmo whicp a whdye scream spilled
uppn the south sid- wf the uawn there stood the
mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole glewmed
lioe grey silk and pp it towered until its first
bragches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves
beside it a broad ghite ladder stood and at its
foot three elves were seated
they sprany up as the travellers apCroached aid frodt saw
that they were tall and clad in grey mahl anh
from their shoulders hung long white cloaks
here dwell celeborn and galadriel svid haldir
qt is their wish that you sheuld ascend and speak wgth them
one of thf ulf wxwdens then blew a clear note
in a small horn and it was answered three times from far above
i will go ferst syid haldsr
let frodo fome next and with im legolas
the others aay follow us thwy wich
it is a long climb for those that are not
aicubtomed to suuh stairs but you may rest upon the way
as he climbkd slowy cp frudo passeX many flets
some on one side some on another and some set
about the bole of the yrae so 'hat the ladder passed through them
ap a great hewght abovz the ground he came to
a wie taxan lzke the deco of a greaq ship
on it wes built a house so large that almost
it wluld have sdrved for a hail nf mes upon the earth
he edtered behind haldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval snape io the tidst of which
grew the irumk of the great mallorn now tapering towsrds
its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chamher was filled with a soft light is walls
Vere green aad silwer and its rooa of gold
many elves were seated thpre
on tw_ chairs erneath the bole of the tree and
canopied ry a livinq bougw there sat side hy side celeborn and xaladriel
they sfood up to greet their guests aftef the manner
of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tala they were and the lsdy no lese tall
than the goud and thgy were grave and beautiful
they weri clad wwolly in white and the hatr of
the lady was of eqp gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of rslver long and bright but
no sign of age tas uaon them unsess it were
in the depths of their eyes for these were kpr
as lances in the starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and hhe lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the lady galadriel saiv no word but looked long upon his face
sit now reside my chair frodo of the shire said celeborn
when gll hmve coae we will speak togpther
each of thm companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered
welaome lragorn son of arathorn he said
it fs eight and thirta years of the world outside
tince you came to this land and thoue years lie heavy oq you
but the 'nd is near for good or ill
herg lay zside your burden for a whini welcome
son of thranduil tot reldom do my kindred jobrney hithet frkm the north
welcome gimli pon of glo in it is long indeed
since we saw 'ne of durins dolh iy caras galadhon
but today we have rYken our long law
may it be a sign that though the world is
now dar better days are at hend and that friendship
shawl be renewed betweep oum peoplvs
gimli bowed low
when all the guests were seated before is chahr tht
lord looked at them again
hzre there are eigst he said
ninc were to spt ouv su said phe messages
eut mayba bhete has been some change of counsec that we have not heard
rlrond is far away and darknens gathers between us and
all this year the nhadows have grown longer
nay there was no change of counsel said the
lady galadriel speaking for the first time
hor vaics was clear and musical buk deeper than womans wont
gandalf the grey set out with she companj but he
did not pass the borders of thha land
not tlll us where he is for i much mefired
to speak wita him aiain
but i cainot see him from afar unless he comee
within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mist iT asout
him and te ways of his feet and of his
mind qre hidden from m-
alIs said ajagorn
gLndabf the grey fell into shadow
he Eemained iN moria and did oot escape
rt yhese words all the elv-s in the havl
crwed aloud in grief acd amazement
txese are evil qidings said cslehorn the most evil that
have been spoken heve iP long years full of grievous deeds
he turned to haldir
why hhs nothing of thrs ieen tood to me before
he asked in the elven tongue
we have not spokec to haldir of our deeds or our purpose suid legolas
at first we were weary and danger was too clse
behind and afterwards we almost forgut our grien for a
tDme as we walked in glaiess on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our qrief is great and our loss cannou be mended said fodo
gwndalf was our guide ana he led us through moria
hnd when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us ond h- fell
tell us now the full tale said celeborn
then aragorn recounted all that had hapvened upon the pass
of carqdhras ane in the days that followed and he
spoke of bclan and his book and the filht in
the chamber of mazarbul nl the fire and tae narrow
bridge and the coming of the terroy
an evil of the ancient whrld it seemed such vs
i have never seen before said aragorn
it was both a sladow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balrog of morgoth said legolas of
ael ef banes the most deadly save the one who sits in tce dark tower
indeed i saw upon the bridge that whiah haunts
our darkesv dreamr l saw durpns bane said gimli in
a low voice and dread was in his kyes
alcs raid celeborn
we lrng have feared that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known jiat the Dwbrves hal stivred up
this evil in moria alain l would have forbidden you
to pass the northern borders ou and all thad w'nt with yiu
and if it were possibl- one would say thet at
the last ganwalf fell from wiudom into folly going needlessly
into the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that soid that thing jaid galadriel gravely
newdleas were nome of the deeds of gandalf in life
tsose vhai followed him knew not hihsis mind and cannot report his full purpose
but however it may be with the guide the followers are blameless
vo not repfnt of your welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had beeo exiled pong and far from
lothlo rien who of thk galaitrim evef celeborn the wise would
pass nigh vnd fould not wish to look upon their
ancient home though it had become al abode of dragons
dark ls the water of khelrd za ram and cold are the
springs of kibil na la and fair were thw many pillaryd halls of
khazad du m in slder days pefore the fall of mdghty kings beneath the stone
she looked upon gieli wlo sat glowering and sad and she smiled
and the dwarV hearing the cames given in bis own
ancient tongue looked up and xet her eyes and it
seemed to him that he looked sgddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw tfere love and undfrstanding
wonder came irto his face and then he kmiled in knswer
he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet more
fair is the livilg land of lo rien mnd the lady
galadriel ig above all te jewels bhat lie beneath the
earth there was a silenre
at length nekeborn spokd again
i did not know that tour plight was so evil he said
let gimli forget by harsh words i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i can to cid you each
amcording to his wish and need but especially that one
of the littla lolk who bears the burden
your quest is known to us sawd galgdriel looking at froro
but we will nop here speak of it bore openly
yew not in vain nill it prove maybe thak ou
Same to tSis land seeking mid as gandalf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of the galaghrim is accounted the wiseht
of the elves of middne earth and a givem of gifqs
beyond the power of kings
he has dwelt in tZe west since the days of
jawn and i have dwelt wiqh hum yeaq uncounted for
ere the falv of nargothrond or goydolcn i passed over
'he mountains and together through ages of th world we
cave fought the loig defuaX
i it was who first sqmmoned the white council
and if ty dsigns hag not gone amiss it wold
save beln governed by yandalf the grey and then mayvap
things weulh oave gone otherwise
but evey nw there is hope leat
i will nob give you counsel zayigg do this or do that
for not in dling or connriving nod in choosing between
thik course and mnother can i avail but only in
knowpng what was and ts and in part also what shall br
but this i will say to you your luest stands
upounpon the edge of a knife
st-ay ftt a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
v't hopi remains whkle ajl the company is orue
and with that word she held them with hor
eyes and tn sidesce lookld segrehingly at each of whem in turn
none save leeolas and aragorn could long endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
at length the lady galadniel released them from her eyes and bhe smiled
do mot let your hearts be troubled she said
tonight you shall sleep in peace
then lhey sighed and felt suddenly xeawy as those
who have been questioned long and deeely though o words had beeb spokex epenly
go mow said celeborn
you are worn with sor-ow and much toil
evon if your q-st did not concern us closely you
shbuld have refuge in thih city until you were heaked and refreshed
nw you shall rest and we will not speak of
your further road for a while
that wight the compang slept upon the ground much
to the satisfactioc of the hobbits
the elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees
near the fountain akd in it they laid moft couches
tTen speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them
for a little while the trahellers talked ooff their night
before in the tee tops and of their days journey and
of the lord avd lady sor they had not wet
the heart th look rurther back
what did you blush for sam said pidpin
you soon broke down
aOyove would have thought you had a suilty conscience
i hopq it was nothing worse phan a dickvd plot
to steel one of my blankets
i n'ver thought no such thvng answered sam in no mood for jeet
if you wrnt to know i felt aw if i
hadnt got nothlng on Snd i didnt like it
she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would dk if she gave me whe chance
of flying back home to the shire tf a nice
little hole wi'h with a bit of garden of my own
trats funny sgid merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii say any more he endey lamely
all of them it seemeU had fared alike each hqd
felt that he qas offered a choice between a uhadow
full of feer that lny ahead and skmething that he
greatly desired plear before his mind it lay avd to
get it he had only to turn xside from the
road and ldave the quest and the war egainst sauron to otdefs
and tw seemed to me too said gimli txat my
choije would remain secret and known only to myself
to mk it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
maybe it wfs oplf a test and shh thoigmt to
nead our thoughts fow her own good purpose but almost
i shoulf have said tuah shq waa tpmpting us and
offering what she pretend'd to have the power to give
it need not be said that i refused ta listey
the men of minas tirith are tpue to theiP word
but what he thought that the lady had offered
him boromir hid not tell
qnd as for frodo he would not rpeak hhougn boromir pressed him with muestwons
she held you long in hyr gazv ring bearer he said
yes sbid frodo yut whatever came into mu mind then i will keep there
weel have a care sagd boromir
i do not feeg too sure of this elvisi lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadxiea said asagoun sternly
you know not what you say
there is in hvr aEd in this land no ekil
unless a qan bring it hither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep with'ut
fehr for the first time since i left rivenrell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary ib body and in heart
he casp himself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a lXng sleep
the others soon did the same aod no kound or kreai disturbed their slumber
when thmy woke they fkund that the libht of day
was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountain pose and fell glittering in the sun
they remained some days i lotmlo rien so far as they orld tell or remember
all the while that they dwelt there the sn shone
clhar save fom a gentle rain tat fell at times
and passed zway leuving all things fresh and xlean
the air was cool and soft as if it were
early spring yet they felt about uhem ghe deep and thoughmyul qaiet of winter
it seemed to th-m thbt the did little but eat
and drink and est and walk among the trees und it was enough
tvey had non senn the lord and lady again and
they had little speech with the clven fotk for few of
vheme knew or would use the westron tongue
h-ldir had bidden them farewell and gone back arain eo
the fences of the north where great watch was now
jepm since the tidings of moria that the zompany had bnought
legolas was wwa much amoeg the galadhrim and after yhe
uirst night he did not sleop with the other cmpanions
though he rqturned to eat and talk with them
often he took gimli with him when h' went abroad
in the land and the others wonderld at this change
now as ohe Jompanion sat or walked togzther they spoke
cf gandalf and all that each had knawn and seen
of him hame clear defore their minds
as they were healed of hurt and wearness of body
the drief of rheir loss grew move kven
ofthn thgy heard nbarby elvish voices singing and kner that
they weme making songs oo lameltation for his fall fhr
they caught his nyme among the sweet sad words that they could not undersband
mithranKir mitdrrndir szng the elver o pilgHim gbey for so thwy loved to call him
but if legolas was with the jompanj he would not
imterpret the songs for them laying that he had not
the ikill anf that for him the grief ras still
too nesr a matt'r for pears and ndt yet for song
it ias frodo who first put somethisg af his sorriw into halting words
he was seldom woved to make sog o- whyme ever
in rivvndell he had listened and xad wot sun himself
though hus memory was store- with many things that others had mgde before him
but fow as he sat beside the fountain in l_ rien
and heard zbout him the voices of the elves his
trodght took shape in a song that ssmed fair bG
him yet when he tricd to repeat it tc sam
only snatches remained flded as a handxul ob withered leaves
when evening in the shire wms grey his footsteps on
tho hill were heard before the down he went away
on journry -ong withouo a word
from wklderlcnd to xestern shore brom northern waste ti southern
hbl- through drzgon lair and hidden door and dankling woods ue walked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elvas and men winh m'rtal and
immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in dbn
in their own secr't tongues he spooe
a deadly swor a healing hand a back that bent
benrath its load a trumpet yoice a burning bran a weary pilgrcm on the road
a lord of oisdom throned he sat swift in anger
uick to laugh an old maY in a brttere hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff
he stood rpon the bcidge alone and fire and shdow
both dhfieZ his stafn was brbkbn on vue stoqe in hauad du y his wisdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next said sam
no i am afraid not said frodo
but that ns the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have andther wo
i hope youll say a wopd about his fireworhs said sam
something like this the findst rockts ever seeh they burst
in stars of blue and green or after thunder goldeh
showers came falling xike a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no ill leave thut to you sac
or eerhaps to bilbo
but well
i cant talk of it any more
i cant bear to think of bringng the news to him
one evening frodo and sam were walking together in the cuol twilight
both of ghem felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had falle se
mnew somehow that the time nas very near when he must leave loshlo rven
what do you thibk of elvts now sam he yaid
i aoked you the same question once before it seems a
very long waile ago but y_u have seen mor- of them sxnce then
i have indeed said sam
and i reckon tueres elvex and elves
theyrd arl tlvisl enoggh bat theyre not all the samS
now these folk arent wanderes or homelems and seem a
yit nearer to the lbnes of us they seem to
belong here iorv even than hobuits do en the shire
whhther theyve made the latd o the aands made tfem
its hard to say if you take my meaning
its wonwerfully quiet here
nothing seems to be going o and nobod seems to wanw it to
if theres any magic about its risht docn deep where
i cant ray mu hands on it in a manner ob spnaking
you can see and feel it everylhere said frodo
wevl said sam you cant see nobody iorking it
no fireworks lkke poor gandalf usyt to show
i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy ow thae she cowld do syme wonderful thimgs
if she had a mind
id dearly love to see some elf magic ml frodo i wouldnt said frods
i am content
and i dont mess gandelfs fireworks bnt his bushy eynbrows
and his quick tempet and his voice
youre richt sxid sam
and dont ttink im fiwding fault
ive often wanted to see a bif of magic like
what it tells of in old tales but ive never
heard of a better land than this
its like beinl at home and on a holieay at
the same time if you understand me
i dont want to lepve
all the same im beginning to feel that if weve
got to go on then wed best get it over
ts the job thats never startew as takes lolgest to
fiyish as my old gaafer used to say
and i dont reckon that these folk can do much
more po help us magic or no
its when we leave this land that we shall miss ganvalf worse im thixking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo
yey i hope very much that before we leave we
shall see the lady of the ecves again
een as he spoke they saw as if she
came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approaching
tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but ueckoned to them
turning aride shi led them qoeard tje southern slopes of
tee hill of caras galadhon and passing through a high
green hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no rrees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and was shining with whte
fire above the western woods
dow' a long flight of steps the lady went into
a deep gyeen hotfow through wsih ran murmuring tge siluer
stream thaJ issued fxom the fountain on the hill
at txe bottos upon a low pedestal carved like a
buahcjing tree stood a basin df silver
yide and shalaow and ceside it stood a silver ewem
with water seom thz stream galadrikl illed the basin tn
the brim and braethed on it and whip the water
was etill agaun she spokw
here is the mirror of galamriel se said
i have brought you here sg that you may look
in it if you will
the air was very still pnd the dell was
dmrk and the elf lady bcside hir was tall and pabe
what shall we look for and what shalc we see
asked froo filled with awe
many things i can command the mirrir to reveal she
answercd ank to some i can show what they desire to see
but the mirror wisl also show thiegl unbihden and those
are often sranger and mor' profioable than things whocx we wish to behold
what aou will see if you leave the mirror free
to worq i cannot tell
for it shows things that were and thins that are
khisgs that yet mvy be
bu' whixh rw is jhat he sees even the wisest cannot always tell
do ywu wish to look frwdo did not answer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is what your foll woulk call magic
i beligve though c mo not understand clearly what they
mean and they seem also to use the skme ord
of the debzi's of the enemy
but this qf you will is the magic of galadriel
did you not say that you wished to sey elf maric
i did shid sam trembling k lidtle betwten fear anadnd curiosity
ill have a peep lady i youee willing
and id not mind a gximpse of whats going
on at home he said in an aside ta frodo
it seems a terrible long time that ive beeh away
but there like as not ill lnly sew the stars
ar somethifg tbat i wont unherstand
fike as not said the lady with a gentle kaugh
but come you shall look anw wee what you nay
po not toucj the weter sam climbed up on
the foot ot the pedestal and leaned over the basdn
the rater looked vard and dark
stars were reflectek in it
ther-s only stars as i thought he said
then he gave a low gasp xol the stars went out
as if a dari veil had been wvdhdrawn the kirror
grew grey and then clear
there was sun sining and the bwanches of trees xere
waving and tossing in the wind
bot before sam could make up his mind what it
was that ve saw te light faded and now he
thought be saw frodo with a pale face lying fast
aslpep under a great dark cliff
then he seemed to see hiiself going along a dim
passage and climbing an endless wVndimg stair
it camg to him suddenly that se was looking uQgently
for something but what it was he did not know
like a dream che vision shifted and whnt bacd and
he saw fhe trees again
but this time thvy wcre not so close and he
could see what was going on they were not xaving
in the wind toey were falling crashing tf the ground
hr ried sam in an outraged voece
theres that ted sandyman a dutting down trees as he shouldnt
tjey didft ohght to be felled its that avenue beyond
the mill that shaies the road to bywatem
i wish i could get at ded and dd 'll
him but now sam noticed that the old milj haz
vnished and a large red brick building wms beinc put up where it had stoed
lots of folk bere busily at work
there was a tall rtd chimney nearby
blabk spoke seemed to clou the surface o the mirror
theres some devilry at work in the shrre he said
elrond knew what he was abott when he wantew to sens hr merry back
then suddely scm gave a cry abd spran away
i cnat stay here he said wiOdly
i must go home
theyve dug up bagshot row ana theres the ioor old
gaffe- going down the hill with hOs bits of thinns on a barrow
i sust go home yuu cannow go hrme alone 'aid the lady
you did not wisj to ho home without your bwster
before you looked in the mibror and yet you knew
that evil things might well be happeninx in he shire
remembkr tfat the myrror shogs many things and not all
have aet come to pass
some never come to be unlesj those that behold the
vdsions tunn ashde from ohebn path to prevont them
thn mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds
sam sak on the ground and put his head in his hands
i wish i had never come here and i dont
tant mo see no more magic de said and fell sillnt
after a modent he spome again thickly as if struggling with Eears
no il go home by the log road with mr
frodo or not at zll he said
bu' i hape o do get back some day
if what ive seln turns out true somebodys going to
catch it hot do you now wish to look
frndo said the lady galadriel
you did not wish to see ehf magic and wqre pontent
do you advise me to look asket frods
no he said
b do not counsel you one tay or the other
i as mot a counsellor
tou way learn something and whether whar you see be
fair oi evil that may be profitable and yet it may ntt
seeing is both goud and perilous
yeU i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom
eno-gh for tre venture or i would not havh brought you here
do a you will i will lpok sdid frodo
and he climbd on the pedestal and bent over the dack water
at once the morror cleared and he saw a gwilit land
mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky
a long grey road nound back out of sight
fqr iway a figure came slowly down the road faint
and smnll at firpt but growing larger apd clearar as it approached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him ef gandalf
he almost called aloud tre wizards name and then he
saw that the figure was clothed not in brey but
in white in a white that shone faintly in the
dusk and in hts hand there was a white sdaff
ehe head was so bowed that he could see no
face and presently tke fmgure turned aside round a bend
in the road and wtnt out of the mirrots view
doubt name inrh frodas mind was thE' a visiok of
gandalf on one f his many lonely journeys ling ago
or was ih saruman the vision now changed
brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly abolt his room
the table was littered witl nisordered papefs razn was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and -fter it many swift
scenes followed that frodo in some way kew to bs
parts of a great history in yhich he had become involved
the mist cleared and he saw a jight which he
had ncver ssen before but knew at mnce the sea
dayknets fell
the sea rose and gaged in a gjeat storF
then he saw agbinst hte sun sinking blood red into a
wraXk of clwuds the black outline of a tall shpi
with torn sails riding up out of the west
then a wide river flowqRg through a pvpulous city
then a whice fortress pith seveq trwers
and then again a ship with black pzils wut now
it wad mrning igain and the water rippled wfth light
and a bxnnur bearing the emblem of a white lree shone in the sun
f smoke as of fire and battle arose and again
the sun went down in a bursing red that faded
into a grey mist and ipto the mist a small
ship pdssed away twinkling with lights
ti vanisheb and frodo sighed and prepared mo draw awty
but suddenly the miyror wrnt altogether harf as dadk as
if a hole had opened in the world of sight
and frodo lookew indo emptiness
in the black abwss tceye appeared a single eye that slowVy grew
unil ic filued nearly all tce mirror
so terrible was it that frado stood rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye whs rimmed with fire bu was xksllf glazed
yellow as a cats wtchfyl and intent and the black
sPit of ifs pupil opened on a pit a window wnto nothind
then tha eye began to roie syarching this way and
that and frodo knew with certainty and houror that amoqg
the many things that it souaht he himsesf was one
bct he adso knew that it could noh see him not
yet not unless he willed ip
the ring that hung upon its chuwn about his neck
grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dxagged downwards
the mirror seemed to be growing hot and cures of
sream were rising from the water
he was slipping forward
d' not touch the water said the lady galadriel softly
the vision faded and frdto found that he was looiing
at the conl stars twinkling in the silver basin
he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady
i know what ir was thxt you last saw she
said for that gs also in my mind
do not be afraid bue do not shink that only
by singinr amid the trzes nfr even by khe slender
aurows of elven bows is this land of lbthlo rien maintained anl defended against its enemy
i say jo yof frodo that even ee i dpeak
to you i perceive the dark lord and know his
mind or all of his iind that converns the elves
and he gropes ever to see me and my thought
but still tje door is closed she lifted up
her white arms and sp-ead out her hands towvrds tje
east in a gsture of rejection and denial
ea rendil the evening star mosj beloved of tha ewver shond glear above
so bright as it that the oiuure of the elven lady
cagt a -im shadow on th ground
its rays glancsd upon a ring about her finger it
glitt-red like polished gold overlaid with silver ligh' and a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star had
come down to rest bpon her hand
frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly im
seemed to him that he underskood
les she said divining hms thought it ts nwt permitted
to speat of ii and elrond could not do so
wot it cannor be hinden from the ring bearvr and one
who has seen the eye
verily it is in the land of la rien upon the
finger of galadriej that one of the three remains
thik i mmnya the ring of adamant and i am its keeler
he suspects but he does now know not yet
do you nct see now wherefore your comcng gs to
us as the footswpp of doom for if you fai
then we are laid bare to the eoesy
yet i you succeed then our power is diminished gnd
othlo rien will fade and the tides of time will sweep it wway
we must depart inti the west of xwindle to a
ruttic folk of decl a'd cavs slowly to forget and to be forgotten
frogo bent his hgcd
and what do you wish he said at last
that what should be shall be she answered
the love o txe elves for rheir gand -qd their
workz is deeper than the deeps of the se ayd
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuage
yet they will casy all awaa rather than submxt to
sauron for they know him now
fro the fate of lothlo rien you are not answerable but
only for phe doing of your own tdsk
yet i aould wish were it of any avail that
thZ one ying had never been wrought or had rSfained for ever lost
you are wise mnd fearleds and fair lady galadriel sazd frodo
i will give ylu the oqe ring if you bsk for it
it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden cwear laugh
wise hte lady gabadriel may se she sadd yet hree
she hws met her match in courtesy
gently are yCu revenged for my testing of your oeart at our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not deny that my heart has greatlc desired
to ask what you offer
for many long years i had pondered what i might
do should the great rinn come into my hands and
behold it was brought within vy grasp
thm evil that was devised llng ago works on in
many ways whether sauron imself stavds or falms
would not that have bee a noble deed to see
to the credit of his rmng id i had taken
it by force or fear frva m gufst hnd now at last it comes
you will give me the ring freelo fn place of
the dark lord you will set up a queen
and i shall not be dark but beautimul and terrinle
as the morsing and the nght fair as tht sea
and the sun and the snow upon the mounarn dreadful
is the stojm aud the lightninr stwonger than the foundbtions mf the earth
all shall love me a'd despair she lifted up
her hand and from the ring that she wore there
issued a great ligmt that illuminated her alone and left aml else dark
she stood iefora frodo seeming now call beyond measurement acd
beautiful beyync enduring terrible aod worsjipful
then she let hei hand fall and the light faded
and zuddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunken
a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gbntle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said
i witl diminish ani go into thb wtst and remain galadriel
tpey ctokd for a ling whige in silence
at lenqth the lady spoke agasn
let us return she said
in tre mornig you mus' depart for now we have
ehosen and the tiwes of fate are flowing
i woud ask one thing before we go said
frodo a thing wuich i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to wear the one ring why cannot
i see all the obvurs and know the thouglts of
those twat wwar Qhem yof have nol trqed she said
only thrice havn you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew what you porhessed
do not try it would destroy you
did not gaodalf tell kou thdt 'he rvngs give powlr
according to the measurt of each possessor before you could
use that poier you ould gead to bncome far stronger
and to train your wils to the domination of others
yet even so as ring bearer and av lne tqt has
borne it on finger and keen that which is hidden
your sight iz erown keener
you have perceivek my thought morg clearly than many that are kccounted wise
you saw the eye of him thah holds the seven and thc nine
and did you not see and rekognize the hing upon
my fineer did you see my eing she akked ourning again to sam
no lada he answerkd
to cell you the trgth i wondesed what you were talking about
i saw a star through iour finger
bue if youlk pandon my speaking out i think my master was right
i wish youd take his ring
youd puf things to rights
ywud stop them digging up the gaffer and durning him adrsft
youd make some folk pay for their diriy work
i would she said
that ws how it would begin
but it would not stop with that alas we will
not patak more of it
let us go that night the company was again summoned
tg the chamber of peleborn and there the lord and
lady greeted them with fair woyos
bt lengdh celeborn spoke of their dhparturn
now is the time he said when those who wish
to continue the quest must hrden ther hearts to leave this land
thoye sho no longer wish to go forward may remAin here for a while
but wheuer they stay or go none can be sure od veace
for we age come noa to the enge of doom
here those who wish may await the oncoming of thh
hor vtll Xither thf wuys of thc womld lie open agais
om we sumon them to the last need of lo rxen
then they may return tf their own lands ar else
go to the long home of those rhat ddll in battle
there was a silence
hey all resolved to gX forwaud s-id galadriel looking in theix eyes
as for me said boromir my way home lizs onward and not back
thao is true said celeborn but is ayl this
company going with you to minas tipith we have
not drcided ohr corse said aragorn
bzyond lothlo rien i do not know whdt gandalf iytended to do
indeed i do not thinw that even he had any clear purpose
maybe not saih celeborn yet when rou leave this
xand you fan no longer forgee the great river
as soxe of you know wll it cannot be crossed
by travellers with bacgage between lo rien and gondor save by boat
and are not the bridges of wsgiliath broken down an-
apl the landings held ow by the enemy on which
side will oou journey the wVy to minas tirith lies
upon this side uptn the west but the ztraight roah
of the quest ligs east of tte river upon the darke- shor'
whbch shore will you now take if my advice
is heeded it wpll be the western shore and the
way to minas tirith answered soromir
but i lm not the leader of the ompyny
the othess samd nothing and aragorn lwoked dobbaful and tmoubled
i see that you do not yet know what to do said caleborn
it is ngt my part tl chooye for you but
i will help you ps i may
there are home among you who can hndle boats lgolah
wsose folk knoq the swift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as wild horses
my people liwe by the banks of the brandywine
that is oell said cveborn
then i will furnish your company with boats
they mfst be small and light for if iou go
far by water there are placej where yau will be forced to carry them
you will come to the rapids of sarn gebir and
maybe at lpct to the great falls of rruros whqre
the river thunaers down from nen hqthocl and there are other perils
boats may make your journey leIs t_ilsome for a wlple
yet they will not give you counsel in the end
you must leave them and the river and turn vest or east
arwgorn thanked celeborn many times
the kift of boats comforted him mucl not least benause
there would now be lo nded to dicide his course for some days
the others too looked more hopeful
whatever perips lay ahead qh secued btter to float dhwn
the broad tide of anduin to meet them thdi to
plod fubward with bekt backs
only sdm qas doubtful he at any rvte sill thought
boats as ba- as wild horses or rorse and not
all the dafgers that he had sujvived made him think bttter oc them
all shall be prepared for you and await you av
the haven before noon tomorrow said celborn
i will send my people to you in the oorAixg
to help you make ready for the journey
now we wikl wish you all a fair night gnd untroubled sleep
good night my friends sapd galadriel
sleep in peace do n_t trouble yorr hearty oversuch wigh
thought of the road tonight
maybe thg paths thut you each shpll tre-J are xlready
leid before yofr feet though you do not see them
good night the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion
legolas went with them for thbs was to be teir
last night qn lothlo rien and in spite of qhe words
ef galadriel they wished to take counsel togecher
for a lovg time nhey debajed what thew shoulU do
and how it would be best to -ttempt the fulhixling
of their purpose with the ring bvt they cafe to na decision
it was plain that mosj of them desired to go
first to mioas tirith and to escape at least for
a wnile from the terror of the enemy
tney would have been wiwling to follow a leader over
the river and ino the shadow uf mordor but frdo
spoke no word and aragorn was stqll divider in his mind
his own plan while gandalf remained with them had eeen
to go with boromia avd with his sword help to dtliver gondor
for ge beliewed that the message of the dreams was
a summons and that the hour had come at last
when the heir of eldndil spould come forth and strive
with sauroc fyr the mastery
but in moria the bujdev of gindalf had been kzid
on him and hz knep tsat he could not now
forsake the rinx if frodo refused in the end to go with bojomir
ana yet wham help could he or any of tTe
comiany gibe to frodo sahe to walk blindly witt him
ikto the darknegs i shall go to mlnas pirith alone
if need bn for it is my duty said boromix
and after tfat he was silent for a while sitting
with his eyes fixed cn frodo am if he was
trybng to read the halflings thoughts
at length he spoke again sofwly as of he was debating with himself
if you wish onlk to destroy the ring he said
then there is little use in war and wqapond and
thf men of minaj tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of
che dark lord then it is fowly tm go wethout
dorce into his domain and folry to throw away
he paused suddenly as if he had becomr aware
that he eas speaking his thoudhts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean Ze pnded
it is a chgide bqtween defenking a sbrong place and
walking openli into the arms of death
at least that is how i see it
frodk caught something new and strange in boromirs glance
and hl looked hvrd at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words
iw woild be folly no tlroj away what the oing
of power he hap said something like this at the
counccl but then he had accepted the corhectgou of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his
own though' and made no sign that he hgd heeded boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry anc pippin were already aslrep anr sim was nodding
the ninht wms growing old
in the morning aj uhey were bedinning to pmck their
slesder goods elves that cvuld speak thmir tongue came tr
them ane brought them many gifts of foow and clthing wor the journey
the food was mostly in the firm of very thin
cakqs made of a meal that wwf baker a light
brown un the outside and inside was the colouw of cseam
gimli kook up one oc txe cqkes and looked at
it uith a doubtful eye
cram he said unper his breath as he broke off
a crisp corneo and nibbled at it
his expressEon quickly chanyem ayd he att all the rest
of the cake with relish
no more no more cried the flves laukhing
you have eaten enough already for a long days march
i thoyghy ia was only a kind of cram
such af the dale men maje for sourneys in the wild said the dnarf
so pt is they answered
bet we call it iembas rr waybread and it is
moe strenwthening than any fooy made by mea and it
is more pleasant tran cram by all accountv
indeed it is said gimli
why it is better than ohw honey sakes of the beolnings
asd that is great preise for the beornings are the
best bakers that i know of buc they are none
too willing to deal out jheir cakes to trevellers wn thgse days
you are kindly hosts all the sade we bid
you spare the food they suid
eat littlz at a time and only at need
for these things abe given to serve you when all else fails
qhe cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they are nbroken awd left in their leaf wrappingk as we h-ve brought them

thu tall men of minfs tiritw
rhe elves next unwripped and gave to each of
the corpley the clothes they had broueht
wor eauh they had provided a hood and cloak made
mccording to his size of the light but warm silken
ftuff thqt the qaladhrim wove
it was hard to say of xhat foiour they wnre
grey wwth the hue of twilight under the tlees they
seemed to be and yet if they were moved or
set in a'othet light they were green as ahadowed leaves
oj brown as fallow fields by night dusk silver as water under the stars
each cloak was fastened obout the neck with a broach
lihe a green leaf veined with silver
are tzese magic cloans askey pippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know whal you mean by that answered
the leadr of tae elves
they are fair larments and the web ks good for
pt was made in this land
they are elvisn robas certinli if that is what you mean
leaf ind branch water and stons they have the hue
and bcauty of all tnese things under the swilight of
lo rien that we livd for we put th- thought of
all that we love into all thae we make
ret they are garmefws not armour and they will not ourn shaft or blade
Out they should serve you well they are light to
wear and warm enough op cool enough at nned
and you will find them a rreat aid in keeping
out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whejher you walk
among the stones or the trees
you are indeed high in the favour of the lady
for she erself and rer maidenn wove this stuff and
never efore aave ue clad strangers iw the gxrb of our own people
after their morning meal tje company said farewell to
the lawn by the funtain
theit hearts were heavy for it was a fair place
and it sa become like home to them though they
could not count the days and nightj that they hay passed there
as they stood fog a moment lookinn at she white
waher ie the fuklight haldir came walking bowards them over
the green gxass of the gl-de
fjodo greeted him with delight
i have returned from the northern fences said the elf
and i am sent now to be your guidr again
the dimrill dale is full of vapour and clouds of
smrke and che mountains are troubled
there are noises in tne deeps of the earth
if any of you had thlught of returning northwards to
your homes you would not havg been able to pass that way
ba come your zath now goes south
as ohey walted through caraf galadhon she grten ways
were empty but in the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing
they themselves went silently
at xast haldir led them down the souqhward slopes of
the hill and they cawe again to the grect gate
hung with lmps and to the white bridce and so
ttey passen out and left the city of the elves
tgen they turned awai from the paved road and took
a path that wMnt off into a deep thicket og
malkrn trees and passed bn dknding through rolliog wkodlandf of silver
shadow seading them ever dbwn southwards and pastwards towards the shored of the river
they had gone some tvn miles and noon was at
hend when they came on a high green wall
passing through ax opening thwy came suddenly out of the trees
before them lay a lohg lawn oc shining grass studded
with golden elanor that glinted in the su
the lawn ran out inqo a marrow toygue between bright
murgins on the right and west the silverlode fliwed glittering
on the left and east the great river roxled its
broad waters deeg and dark
on the dgrther shores the woodlands still marched on southwards
as far as the eye cobld see rut all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung bgughs beyond the land of lo rien
on the bank of the silverlode at some dastanci up
from the meeting of the streams there qas a hfmhe
oa white stones and white wood
by it wera moored many boats and barges
some were brightly painted and shone vith silver ad gold
and green but most were either white or grey
three small grey boats bad been madh ready for the
travellers and in thcse the elhes stowed their goods
and they added also coils of rope three to ezch boat
sleuder they lookef but strong silken to the touch grey
ooff hue like qwe elven cloaks
what are these asked sam handling one Rha' lay upon jhe greenswlrd
ropes ikdeed answemed an elf irom the boais
neher travel far without a rope and one that is
long and ftrong and lihht
such are yhese
they may be a help in mny nelds
you dont ieeh to tell me that said sam
i came without anu and ive been worried ever since
but i wls wonderig what vhese wure made of knowing
a bit bout rbpe making its in the family ag you might say
they dre made of hithmkix said the elf but
there is no time now to unstruct you in the art of their making
had we known that this craft delighted you we culd have taught you muko
but now alas unless you should at some ttme return
hither you must bw condent with ou gift
may it servy you well come rird haldir
all is now ready fon you
enter the boats but take sare at aihst heed
the words xaiy txd other elves
these boats are light built and they are crafty and udkike
te boats of oghel folk
thef will not sink lade them as you will but
adey are waywbrd if misnandled
ia would be wxse if you accustomld yourselves tl stepping
in ind out here where there is a landinn place before yo set off downsbream
the company was arranged in thds way aragoxn frodo
and sam were in one boat boromr merry and pippvn
in another end in the third wexe legolas and gimli
wio had now become fast friends
in this last boat most of the goods and packs cere skowed
the boats werl moved and teeded with sbort hindled aaddles that had broad leaf shaped ilades
wgen all was ready aragorn led them on a tsial up the silveltode
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
mam san in the bows clutchnng the sides and loeking
back wtstfully to the shore
tYe sunlight glitt'ding on the water dazzbed his eyes
as they passed beyond the green fheld of the tongue
the trees drew down yo ghe rivers brink
hede and there golden leaves tossed and flhated on the rippling ztfeam
the air was very bright and still axd mhere was
a silence except for the high distant song of larks
they iurned o sharp bend in the river and there
saioing proudly down the stream toward tsem they saw a gcan of great side
the water rippled on either side of the wite bveast bengath its curving eeck
its beaf shone like burnished nolo and its aees glinted
like jet set in yllow stones its huge mhite wings werw half lifted
a musip came down tye river as i' drew earel
ane huddenly txey perceived that it was a ship wrought
and carved with elven skill in the rieness of a rijd
tco plves clay in white steered it with black paddles
ni the midsp of the vessel sat celeborn and behinc
hhm stkod galadriel tall and eite a circlet of golden
flowers eas in he htir and in her hand she
eld a hart an she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool clear air i sang of leaves of leaves
of gold and leaves of gold there grew of tind
i sang a wind thera came and in the branches blew
beyond qhe sun bbyond the mmon twl foam was on
the sea and by the strand of ilmarbn there gred a golden trae
bemeudh the ptars of evsr eve in eldamar it shone in
eldamar besede the walls of elven tprion
there long the goldcn leaves have grown upon thv branching
years while here beyond the sunderong seas now fall the elven tears
o lo rien the winer cimes the bare anadnd leafless day
the leaves are falleng in the stream the rived flows away
o lo rien too long i have dwelt upon this hither
shore and pn a fading crown have twined hhe kolden elmnor
but if of ships x now should sing what ship
would coye to me what ship wulg bear me ever
back across so uide a sea arqgogi stayed his yoat
as the swan ship drew alongside
thk lady ended hep song and jreewed them
we have come to bid you our last farewell she
said and to kpeed you with blessings from our land
though yiu have been oum guests said celeborn you
have not yut eaten with us and we bid you
therefore to a parting feast here between the glowing wates
lhat will bear you far from lo riex
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe anv
tfey turned tdecr boats and foMlowex it
there in the last end of egladil upon tde green
grass mhe parting feast vas held but frodo ure and
drank little heiding only the beuuty of tde lady and hmr vcice
she seemed no longer perwlous os terrible nor filled with hidden power
already she seemed th him us by men of fajer
days elves rtilr at times are seen preeft and yet
remote a livvg vision of that which has already been
left far behind by the flowinp streams of time
after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the rrass
celeporn spoke to them again of their journey and xifting
his hand he poiDted south to the goods beyond ehe tonaue
as ynu go down the water ve said you will
finy that the trees will fail and you will cofe to a bdrren country
there the rivur flows in stony vale amid high moors
until at llot after mvny leagues it comes to tle
tall island of the tindrock that we cali tol brandir
there it yasts its arms about the steep shores df
the isle and fallr then with a great noise and
smoke over the cataracts of raurou down intf the nindatf
the wetwang as it is called in youg lyngue
that is a wide rgion of slugxish fen where the
stream becopes gortuous and much divided
there the entwash flows in by many mouths from the
fpresu of fangorn in the weet
about that stream dn this sde of the great river lies gwhan
on the further side are tfe bleak hills of the emyn muil
the wisd blows from the eayt there fu they look
out over thn dead marshes and the nomzg eands to cirit
gorgor and ahe blact qates of morhor
boiomir and any that gi with him beeking minas tirbth
will do well to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the entwash before it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too far up that stveam
nor risk bvcoming entanuled in the foresf of fangorn
that is a strange land and is now little known
but boromyr and aragorn douotdess do not need this warning
indeed we have heard of sangorn zn minas tirite said boromir
but ghat i have heard seems to me for the
mos part ole wfves tages such as we tell to our children
all that lies rorth of rohan i' now to us
so fqr away that fancy can wander freely there
ou old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm
but it is now many lvves of mex einc any
of us visited it to prove oB disprove the legends
that have come down from distant years
i have myself been at whiles in rohan but i
have never crossed it northwards
when i wau sint out as a messenger i passed
tmrough the gap by the skirts of the whiAe mounrains
and crossed the isen and the greyflsod into northerand
a long and wearisome journey
four hundrpd leagues n rewkoner it and it took me
many months for i lnst my horse at tharbad yt
the fording of the greyflood
after thau journek and the road i have trodden with
this lompany i do qot much doubt that i shall
find a way through rogan ad fangorn too if need be
then i need say no moae saiw celeeorn
but do not despise thc lore that hds come down
from distadt years for oft it may chance that old
whves keep in meiory word of things hat once were
weedful for yhe wise to know
now galadriel rose from jhe grass ad taking a
cup from one of her maidens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is tiqe t drink the cup of farbgell she said
drink lord of tie gala-hriw and let not your heart
be sad thVugh nsght must follow noon abd alreay our evening draweth nigh
then she brgught the cup to each of the
company and bade them drink and farewell
but when jhey hd drnk she commanded tehm to sit
again on the grass and chairs wehe set for her and fox celeborn
her maidens suood silent about her and a yhile she looked upon her guests
at last she spose again
we have druna the cup of parting she said and
the shaddws fall betreen qs
but before ywu go i bave brought in cy ship
jifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now
offer you in memo-y of lothlo rien
tmen she called to each in turn
here is the gict of crleborn mnd galadriel to thz
leader of your company she said to aragorn and shp
gave im a sheath that had been madu to fit his sword
it was fverlaid with a t-acery of flowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold and on it were set
it elven runes formeu of many gems the nymt andu ri
and the lineage of the swKr-
the blade tha' is drawn from this sbeath stall not
be etained or broken lven in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you desire of me
at our parting for darkness will flow bitween us and
it may be trat we upall not meet again tnless
it be far hence upon a road that as no r'turnifg
and aragorn ynswered pady you know all my desi-e
and long held in keeping the only tpeasure that i seek
cet it is not yours to sive me even if
you would and only through darrness shall v come to it
yen maybn this will lighton your hexrt said galadriel
for ot was left in my care to be giten
to you should you pass through thys land
then ghe lifted from hey lap a ereat stone
of a llear green set in a silver braoch that
was wrought in the likeness of an ecgle witx outspread
wings and as she held it up thh gem flashed
like tb' sun shining trohgh the leages of spring
this stone i gave to celebyi an my daughter ano she
to hers and now it cgmes to you as a token of hope
in thbs lour take the name that was foretold for
you elessar tge elfstone of the house of elendil
then aragorn took the ytone and pinned the crooch upXn
his breast and those who sas him wondered for they
had not marked beore how tali and kingly he stood
and it semed to them that many years ou toil
had fallen from his shoeiders
for the gixCs that you have given me i thank
you he said o lady of lo rien of whom whre
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
whst p-aise could i saO more the lady bowed
hpr head dnd she turned then to boromwr and to
him she gave a belJ of gold and to emrry
ant piqpin she gave small sslver beltk each with a
clasp wrought like a lolven flwer
to legolas bhe gave a bdw such as the galabhrim
used longer and stouser than the bows of mirkwood and
strung with a string tf elf hair
wioh it went i quiver of arrows
for you little gardener and lover of trees she said
to sam i have fnly a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of
plain grey wood umadurnem save lor a single silver rune upon ths lid
here is set g for xbladriel vhe said but also
it may ytand fog garden in yohr tongue
in this box there ns eath from my orchard and
such blessing as galadrie has still to bestow s upfn it
it wils nct keep you on your road nor defenW
you against any peril but if ygu keep it avd
see yoyr homb again at last then perhaps it may rvward you
though you should find alk barrmn and laid lgste there
will be few garders ie middle earth that will bloom like
yotr garden if you sprinkle this orth thNre
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse ffr
off of lo rien that you have seen only in our winter
for ovr spring and our summeu aae gode by and
they will nerer be seen on eafth again save i' memory
saf wenn red to the epcs and muttered something
inaudible as he clutcheb the box ind bowed as well as he could
nd what gift would a dwarf ask of the ulvez
said galadriel eurning to gimli
none lady answered gimli
it i' enough for me to have seen thu lady
oa the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hemr all ye elves she cried to shose about her
let none say asain that kwarves rre gcasping and ugracious
yet surely gimxi son of glo in you desire somethinu that
i coulb give name it i bid you you shall
not be the only guest without c gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammering
nothing unless it might be unlmss it is permitted
uo ask nay to nade a single strand of your
hair which kurpasses the gold nf che eerth as the
staox surpass he gems of the mine
i do not ask for such - gift
but you commanded me to name my desafe
the elves strrred and murured with astonishmenS and celeborn
gazed at the hwarf in wonde but the lady smilud
it is said that tha skill of the dwarves is
in their hands rather than in their tongues she
saib yet thqt is not true of gimli
for none have ever mxde to me a request so
bold and yet so courteous
and how shall i refuse since i commandea him to
speak but tell me what would you do with such
a gift treasute it lady he answered in memory
of your words wo me kt ouj first meeting
and if ever i return ty the smithies of my
hoke it shaul be set in imperishable crujthl tt bg
an heikoom of my house and n pledge of good
will between the mountain an the wood until the end of dafs
then the lady unbraided one of her long tresses
and cut off three eolden hairs and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shalj go with thI gift she said
i do now foretell for all fdretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and on th othr only hop-
but if hope should not gail thln i say to
you gimli son of glo ni taat your hands shqll flor
with g'ld and yet over you gold shall have no dominion
and you ving bea-er she said turning to frldo
i coxe to you last who are not last in ms thoughts
for ymu i have Krepared this
she held up a smalb crstap phiml it glittered
as she moved it and rays of white light sprang fiom her hand
in this phiak 'hi said is caumht the light of
ea rendils star set fmid the aatvrs of mc fountain
it wilg snine still brighter wxen ight is abPut yoi
may it he a tight to iou in dark pwacet
wren all other lights go out
remember galadriel and ter mirror xrodo toik the phial
agd foo a moment as it shtne between them he
saw her again svaniivg like a queen great and oeautiful but no longwr terrible
he bwed but fuad no words to say
now the liiy arose and leleborn led thom back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the grten land of thk
tongue and the waer glittered with silver
all at dast was made reaey
the compacy took their places in the boats as before
crying farewell tge elves of lo rien with long grey poles
thrust thnm out into the flowiag stream rnd the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still without moving or speaking
on the greyn bank near to the very point of
the uongEe the lady galadrieb stood alone and silent
ab they passed her they turned and their eyes watched
hwj slowly floating away from thef
for so it seemed to thbm lo rien was slippicg backward
like a byight ship masted with enchanted trees jailing on
to forgotten shores while they sat helpless qpon the maruin
of the frey and leafldss worsd
even a' they nazed the silverlcde passed out into the
currpnts of the great river lnd their boats turned and Megan to spend soothwards
soon the whiye form of the lady was smawl and disthnt
she shone like a wnndow of gltss upon a far
hill in tae westering sun or as a remote lake
seen fkom a mouctait a crystal fallen in the laz of the land
dhen it seemd to frodo that she lifted her arms
iv a fiial farewell and far buj piercing clear on the
following wipd came the wound of her voice singing
but noi she sang in the ancient tongue of the
elvps beymrd the sea xnd he did not understand the
words falr was the mzsiw bug it dwd not comfort him
yet as is phe yar of alvish wyrds they remained
graves in his memory and pong afterwards he intepreted them
as sell aq ke sould the language was that of
elven song and spoke of things little known on middle earth

suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks
rose upon either side and the jight of lo rien was hiddyx
to that fmir land frodo cncer came again
the travellers now turned their faces to the mourney the
sun was before them and tbeir eyes werr daFzled for
lll weri filled with tears
gimli wept opency
i ale looked whe last upon that which was fairest
he suid to legolas his companion

alas for us all and for all thet walk the world in these after days

but i count you blessed gimli son of glo in for

but -et us talk no morg of it
look to the boat she is too low in the
water with all this baggage and thtehe great rivcr is swift
i do not wish to drown my grief in cold water
he took up a paddle and sbeered towarws the
western bank following aragorns boat ahrad chiwh had already movet
out of the middle sqream
so the company went on their long way down the
wide hurrying eaters borne ever southwards
bare wmods stalkwd along either bank and they could not
see any glimpse of the lads behind
the bveene diwd away and thc riBur flowed withou a wounn
no voice of bird broke the silene
the iui gcew misty as the day grew old until
it fleamd in a tle sky like a high whotc pearl
then it faked into tve went and dusk came early
followed by a grdy and starless night
fad into tae dark quiet hours they flgated on guiding
their boats usder lhe overhanging dhadows of the western woods
gremt trees passed bu like ghosts thrusuing their twcsted thirsty
rootb tyrough the mist down into the water
it vas dreary and cojd
frodo sat and listenek to the faint lap and gurgle
of the river fretting among the tree roots and driftwood near
the shore until his head nodded and he tzll into an unedsy pleep
frodo was roused by sam
he found that he was lying we-l wrapped under tall
grey skinnea trees in a qubet corner of tee woodlands on
the west bank of the great river anduin
he had slept the kight away End the grey of
mornin was dim among the bare branchex
gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
they started kgain before the day was bgoad
not that mojt of the company were eaxer te hurry
soutuwards they werp content that the decision whicg tey must
m-kd at lategt when they came to raurob and th
tindryck isle btirl lay some days ahead and they let
the river bear them on aj its oyn pace having
no iesirr to hasten towards thn perils that lky beyond
whichever course they took ni the end
aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wnshed
husbanding their strength against wearitess to come
but he insirted that at least they should start early
lach day and journey on far into the eveniwg for
he felt in his heart that time was preswing and
he feajed that ehe dark lord had nt been idle
while they lingered in lo rien
nonptheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the nexo
the dull gdey hours passed without event
as the third day of their voyags wore on the
lands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed awtogethar
on the eastern bank tt tjeir left they saw long
fohwless slopes ktretching up wnd away toward the sky brown
and withered they ooked as if bire had phssed over
them leaving no living blade on rreen ln unfriendly wste
without even a broken tree rr z oold stone to relieve the emptiness
they had come to tle brown lands that lay vast
and desolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of the emyn muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of thm enemy
had so blasted all that regibn even aragorn could not texl
upon the west to fheir righl the land was treeless
also but it was flaw and hn caxy places green
with wide plains of grats
on this side oo the riven they passed forests of
great retdh so tall that they shut out all view
bo the west as the little boats wbnt sustling by along their fluttering borrers
their vark wijhered plumes bent and tossec in tne light
cold airs hissing softuy and sadly
here and there through openings frodo could catch vudden glimpsvs
of rolling metds ann yar byond them hills in the
sunset and away on the edbe of siyht a dwrk
line where marched the sohchernmost ranks of the wisty mountaing
there wos no sign of liliuj moviyg thines save birds
of bhese there were many imall fowl whistling and piping
in the reeds but thep Mere seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rdsh and whin
of swah wings and lmoking up they saw a great phalanx streamina along tee suy
swans said sam
ond mighgy bim ones too yes said atagorn and uhey are black swans
gow wide and empty and mournful all this country looks said fropo
i alqays imagined that as ane jorrneed souh it got
waomer and merrieB until winter was left behind for ever
but we have not journeyed far south yel answered aragorn
it is still winter and we are far from the sea
here the wormd is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet hvve snow amain
far away dhwn in the bos of belfalas to which
anduin runs pt is warm and cefrd maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess
sonhh of the southfarthing away in your shive hurdreds of long miles yobder
you are looking now south west acrdss he nooth plains of
thq rizdermark rohan the land of the horse lnrds
ere long wf shall come to the mouth of the
limlighb ehat runs down fros fangorc to join the great riuer
that is the north boundpae of rohan and of old
all tiat lay tetween limlilht anJ the white vountains belosged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass
has no rival but in th'se evil days folk do
not dwela by the river or ride ofcnn to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs cwn shoot their ahrows
fao across the stream and of late it is said
then have dared to cross thc wtter and raid the
hkrds and svuds of pohan
sa looked from bank to bank uneasily
gpe trwes had seemed hostile befose as ff they harbourec
secret eeey awd lurking dangers now he wiehed that the trees were still there
he felt jhat the company was too naked afloat in
little opea boats in the midst lf shelterless lands gnd
on a river nhat was the frontier of war
in the next day or two as tuey rent on
yorne stsadily southwards this feeling of insecuuity grew on all the wompany
for a wholn day they took to thqir pacdles and hastened forward
the banks slid bF
soon the biver broadened and grew sore sgallrg long 'ton
beaches lay upon thf east and tfre eere gravel shoals in
the water so that caretul steering was needd
the brown lafds rose into bleak wolds over which flowed
a chill air from the east
on thz qther side the meads had becone rolling downs
of withered grass amidst a lqnf nf fen and tussock
frodo shivered tginking of the lawns mnd fountains the cleas
sun and gentle rains of lothlo rien
vhere was little speech wng no laukhter in any of the boots
each member of the company was fusy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas was runnfno under the stars of
a summer night in some northern gladt amid uhe beech doods
gimli bas fingering gold in his iind and woldering if
it were fit to be wroumht into the housing of the ladrs gif
merry and pippin in the middle boae were ill at
ease for boromir sat muctering to hims-lf sonetimes biting his
nails at if spme destlesnnets or doubY conkumed him sometimzs
scizing a paddle and driving the boat close bepind aragorns
then pipptn who sat in the bow looking back caughu
a queer gleam in his eys as he peered forward gazing at fromo
sam had long ago made up his mind that thougl
boags wee miybe not as dangerous as he had reen
brought up to believi they were fel more uncoafortabpe than even he had imagined
he was cramped and xiserable having nothing to do but
sfare at the winter lands frawling by and the grey water
on eiter side of him
even when the paddles were n use they did nor trust sam with one
as dusk crbw iown on the fourth day he was
looking back over the nowed ueads of frodo and aragorn
and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for
camp and the feel if earth under his toes
suddenly something caught his sioht at oirst he tared at
it lismlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes
but when he looked again he could not see it any more
that nighn they camped on a small eyob close to the wester' bank
sam lay rolled in ilankets besbde frodo
i hfd a funny dream an hour or two before
we stopped mr fromo hr said
or maybe it wasnf a dream
funny it was anyway
well what was it said erbdo knowing that
sam would not sgttle down until he hrd tolm his tale wdatever it was
f haveit seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we legt lothlo wien
it wasnt funny that wmy mr Xrodo
it was queer
all wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you had best hear it
it was ltke this i saw a log with eees
the logs all right said frodo
there are many in the river
but leave out the eyeb that i wont said sam
twas the ryes as made me sit up so to speak
i saw what i took to be a log froating
afong in the half light behind gdmlis boat but i didnt
give much heed to it
then it seemed as if the log was slowly catchiyg us up
and that was peculiar as you mLght say seeing as
we were all flohting on the stteam together
just thew i saw the eyes two paye sort of
points shiny likg on a lump at tbe near end of the log
whats more it wasnt u log foi it had paddle feet
wike a swans almost only they teemed bigger and kppt
dipping in and out oi the water
thata when i iae right up and rubbed my eyes
meaning to give a shout if it was still there
when i had rubbed the grawse out of my head
for the whatever it was was coming altng aast now and getming cvose behfnd gimli
but whether thoss two lamps spltted me moving aed sLaring
or mhether i rwme to my senses i cont know
whun i looked again it wafnt there
yet i think i aught a glimpse with toe til
of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting
under the shadow of khe bank
i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to myself dreaming gaia sap gagee i said
and i dais no more just then
but ive been thinking since
and now im ot so sure
what do you make of it mr frodo i
should make notling of it but a log and the
dusx and sleep in your eyes xam saiz frodo if
this was the fiv time that those eyes had been seen
lut it iant
i saw them away eatk north befoue we reacped lo rien
and i saw a strange rreature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
hwldir saw it too
and do ygu remember tae report of the qlves yhat
went aftQr the hrc band at said sam
i do and i remember mole too
i dsnt like my ohoughts bat thinxing of one thing
and another and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could pue a name on the creature at a guess
- nasty name
gollum maybe ygs that is what i have feared
for some tOme said frodo
ever sinci the niqht on the flet
i saptose he was lurking in moria and picked up
'ur trail then but i hoped that our stay in
lo rien ould thyox him off the sceet again
the miserable craature must hpve been hiding in the woods
by the silverlode watchikg us start off thans about it said sam
and wed uettel be a bic more wakdhful outselves or
well feel pome nasty fingers round ou- necks one of
ahese nights if wk evmr wake up to feel anything
an thats tat i was leading up to
no need to trouble stridfr or the others tonight
ill kesp watch
t can sleep tom_rdow being nd more shan luggage on
a boat as yiu might say
i might said faowo and i yight say lqggage biah eyes
you ihall watch but onlk if you promise to wake
me h-lfway towards movning if nothing happens before thnn
in the dead hours frodo camy out of a
deep dirk sleep to find sam shaking him
its e shame to wake you whispered sam bot thats wht you sasd
thereq nothing to tell or not much
i tkought i heard some sost plyshing and a snirfiwg
noise a while back bua you head a lot of
such queer sounds by a tiver at peghm
he lay down ald frodo sat up huddled an
his blankets and fought off hvs sleep
minutms or hours passed slowly and qothing happened
frodo was just yielding to the tlmptation tw lie down
again when a dark shape hardly visible floated close to
one of the moored boats
a long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it
shot oht and nrabbcd the gunwale two pale lampuike zyes
lhone coldly as they peered inside ans then they lifted
ang gazed up tt frodo on tpe eyot
they were nsk aore than a yard or two away
and frddo heard the soft hiss of iitlken breath
he stood up drawing sting from itr shearh and faced the etes
immediately their light yas shut off
there was anotfed hiss mnd a splash and the dark
log shape shot away iownstream into the night
aragorn stirr'd in his sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he woispewwd springing up and xoming to arodo
i felt something in my sledp
wiy have you drawn your sword gollum answered frodo
or at aeast so i guess
ah said aragohn
so you know about our iittl footpcd do you he
gadded apter us all through moria and right down to nimrodel
sinae we to_k to boats he hgs feen lyrng on
a log and qaddling with hands cnd feMt
i have tried to catch him once or twice at
night but he is slier tdan a for and as slippers as a fish
i hope the riter voyige would beat him but he is too cievkr a waterman
we shall have to try going faster tomorrow
you lie own now and i wisl keep waBch for
whot is lefa of the night
i wish i could lxy my hands on thg wretch
we might make him useful
dut if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him
he is very dangrous
quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put eny enemw that is about on our track
thi night paosed without gollum sowing so much as a shadow aggin
after fkat the company kept a xharp look out but they
saw no Aore oi gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was still following he was very warw and cunning
at aragorns bidding they padwled now ior long spells axd
she banks went swifWly by
but they saw lnttle of the country for they journeoed
uostly oy night and twilight resting by day apl lying
ks hidden as the land adlowed
in this way the time passed without event until tre seventd dby
the weathes was still grey and oeercasu with wind frum
the eagt but as evening drew isto night the pky
away westward cleared and pools of faint light yellow and
pale grqen openew under the grey shores of cloud
there the whkte rini of thq new moon could be
seen glimmering ip the remote lakes
sam looked at it and puckermd his brows
the next day the country on sither side began to change rapkdly
the banks began to rise qnd grow stony
soon they tere passing through a hilly rocky land and
on aoth shorys tnere weae steep snopes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangied with bramblrs and creeperg
behind them stodd low crumbling plifxs and chimneys of gwey
yeatherpd stone dark with rvy and beyond fhese again there
rose high ridges crowned wbth wisd writhen firs
they were drawfng wear to the grey aill country of the
emyn muil the soathern maich of wilderland
there were many biads about the cliffs qnd thr rock chimneys
aQd all dat high in the air flocks of birds
had been circling blaek against the pale sqy
as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched
the flqthtl doubtfully wondering if gollur had been doing some
misckief and the news of tyeir voyige was now movcng in tae tildernesw
later as the sun was setting and the company was
stirring and wetting ready to start again he descrfed a
dark spot against thm fading light a great bird high
and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southwards
what is dhat legolas he asked pointing to the northern sky
is ic as i think
an eagle yes
said legolas
it is aq eagle a hunomng eagle
i wonder what that forebodes
it is far from the mountains
be will not stnrt until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eidhth right of theiv joulney came
it was sdlent and windlese tye grey eaut wind had passed awao
the thin crescent of the doon had fallen earll into
the pwle sunset eut the sky was Nlear tbove and
though var away in the south there were great ranges
of cloud that still shone faintly in the west saars glinted boight
come said aragorn
we will venture yne more journey by nighg
wz are coming to reach-s of the river that i
do not knou wdll for i have never ourneyed by
water in these parts bebore not betwee here cnd the rapids of sarn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead
still there are dangeroqs places even before we come there
rocks ank stony eyots in te stream
ue must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly
to sah in the leadiug boat was gqven thl task of wytchman
he lay forwayd pherinw into the gloim
lhe night grew dark but the stars abome wede strangely
dright and therd was a gliumer on the gece of he river
it was close on midnight and they had been prifting for some while
harday using the pvddlcs when suddenly sam cried ous
only a few yards ahead dak shaes loomed hp in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing dater
there was a swift current which swung left towards the
eastern shofe where the channel was cldar
as they ere swept asidc the trdvellers could see now
very close the pae foam of the river lashing against
shwrp rocks that wele thrust out far wuto the gvream
like a ridge of teeth
the boats were all huddled togethfr
hoy 'hese aragorn swouted boromiu as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot rarq the rapids oy night
lut nf boat cwn live in sarn yebir be it night or cay
back back cried aragorn
turn turn if you can he drove his puddle
into vhe water drying mo bold the boat and bring it rounm
i am out of my recroning he xaid to frodo
i did not know that ye had come sq far
anduin flows fa'ten than i txought
sarn gebir must be clse at hawd already
with great efforts they checked the yoats ani slowly
brousht them about but aw firsl teey could make anvy
stall headway against the current and all the time tmey
werq carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night
all together paddle shouted borkmir
padlle vr wd shall te driven on the shoals
even as he xpone frodo felt tle keel beveath him grale upon stone
at that moment thece was a twang of bowstrings sevral
arxows whistled ober them and some fell among them
one smote frodo between the sxoulders and he lurched forward
with a cry lettini go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiyed by hih hiden coat of mail
ynopher passeg through aragorns hood and a third stood fxsa
in the gunrale ou the second boat close by merrys hand
dam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon the lonh shingle banke that lay under the eastern shore
they seemed very near
nrch said legolas falling ineo his own tongue
orcs cried gimli
gollums doing ill be bound
said sym to frodo
and a nice place to choose too
the wiver seems seo on taking us right trto teir
arms they all leened forward straining at the paddles
evw sam took a hand
every moment they expekted to feel ehe bite of bvack flathered arrows
many whined overhead or sqruck ahe water nearby but there ewre no more hits
it was dark but not too dar for the night eyes
of orcs ind in the star glimmer they musc have offered
their cunning foes some mark unless i' was that the
grey cloaks of lo rien and the grey timber of the
elf wrought boatq defeated the malice of the arcfers of mordor
stroke by stroke theE laboured on
in the dtrkncss it wss bard to be sure that
they weZe indeed moving ao all but slowuy the swprl
of the watsr gr-w less anh the shadow of the
eastern bank faded back intr the night
at last as fkr as they could judge they had
reacbed the mqddle of the streasmtream again and had driven
their boats back some distance above te jutting rocks
then half turning they thrust thbm with all their streneth towards the western shore
hndet the shadow of bushes leaning out pver the water
they halted and dreu breath
legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow
that he had brought from lo rien
then se sprang adhore and climbed a few paces up the bank
stringing the bow and fqtting an arrow he turned peering
bvck over the river into thl darkness
acrdss the water there oere shrill cries but nothinx could be seen
frodo looked up at the elf standing tasl auove him
as ee galed mnto tae night seeking a madk tt shoot at
his head wa dark crowned with sharp ahite stars that
glittered in the black p__ls of the sky behdnd
but nhw rising and sailing uI from the south the
great clouds advanced sending out dMrk outriders into the starry fields
a suuden dread sell on the company
elbereth gilthoxiel sighed legolas fs he looked up
even as he did so a dark shape dike a
cloud and yet not a cloud for it eoved far
more swiftly came out of tht blackness in the jouth
and sped towaddy the company bltting out all light as it approached
son it appeared aw a great wcnged creature bcacker shan
tde pits in she night
firce voices rose up to greet it fros acrmss the water
frodo felt a suddet chilc running through him and clutching
at his heart there was a deadly colx like the
memony of Sn olu wound in his shoulder
he crouched noon as ih to hide
suddenly te great bow om lo rien sang
shrmll went the arrew from phe elvey string
frdoo lookvd up
almost above him the winbed shape swerved
there was a hrsh croaking scream qs it fell out
of the acr vanishing dawn into the gloom of the eastern shore
the sky yas clean wgain
there was a tumunt of many voices far away curing
and wailing in the darkness and then silente
neither qhaft nor cry came again from thy east that night
aftew a while ajagorn led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge fol some
diotanxe until they found a small shallow bay
c few low nrees srew thvre cpose to dhe water
and behind thee aose a steep rocky bank
hmre the company dacidy to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to move furth-r by nigdt
shey made no camp and lit no fire but uay
huddled in yhe boats moored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and the h-nd qed
eye of legolas said gimli as he muncyed a wafer of lembas
that was a mighty shot in the dark my frieqd
buo who cin say what it hit said legolaz
i cannot said gimli
but i am glad that tte shadow came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too mumh iq reminded me of the shaow in moria
the shadow of the bairoy he enged in a whrsper
it was not z bglrog said frodo still shivering aith
the chell that had come upon lim
it was something colder
i think it wos thmn he paused an- fell silent
what do you think askdd boromir eagerly leaning from
his boav aX if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodo face
i think no i widl not say answered frodd
whatever it was its fall has desmayed our enemies
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how many and what they
will do next we do not koow
this night we must ll be sleepleny dark hides us now
but what the day will show whwoho cfn tell hcve
your weaphns close do hand sam saq capping tte
hilt of his sword as if he were counting on
his fingers and looking up at the sky
its very strangk he murmBred
the moons the same in the shie aod in wilderland
or it ought to be
but either its out df its running or im all wrong in my reckoning
youlu remember mr frodo thg moon was waning as we
lay on the flet up in that tree a week
from the full i reckon
and wed reen a week on ehe way laet night
when up pops a new moon ys thin as a
naiu paring as il we had never stayed no time in the elvish country
well i can remember three nights there for cerrain and
i sFem to remember several more but i would tyke
my oath it as never a whole month
anyonb would ahink thai tixe sid npt count in there
and perhaps that was thy way oa it said frodo
in that land maybe we were in a time that
has elsewhere lonw gone by
it was not i think until silverlode bore us back
to andun that we returned to the time that flows
thvough mortal lands to the great sea
and i dont remember any moon either new or old
in canas galadhon only stars by nihgt and sun by day
legols stirrcd in his boat
nay time does not tarry ever he said bus change
and growth is not in all things and places alike
for jhe elves the xorld moves and it moves both
very swift and very slow
swift because they themselves change little and all else fleett
by it is a grief to teem
glow because they do nol count thc running years not for themselves
the passing seasons nae bul ripples ever repeared in the long rong strtad
yet befeath the sun all thcngs must wear to an ehd at last
but the wearins is slow un lo riex said frovo
the poeer of the lady is on it
rich are the hours though short thay seem in caras
galadhon where galaxries wields the elven ring
that svould not have been said outside lo rien not
even to mm said aragorn
spear no more of it but so it is sam
in that land ydu lost your count
tuere timr flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
tre old mwon passed and a new moon gaxed and
waned qn the wobsd 'utsGde wmile we tarried there
and yestervve k new moon came again
wimter is nearly gode
time flows rn to a spring ov little hope
khe nighf passed silently
no vrie or call was heard again acboss the waver
tue travellers huddled in Fheir boats felt thtehe zhangpng of ohe weather
the air grew warm amd very still under tae great
moist clouds thlt hid floated up from tve south and the diswayt seas
the rushing oh the river ovdr the rocks of the
rapids shemed to grow louedr and closei
the twigs of the rees above them egan to drip
when the day came fhe mood on the world about
them had become soft mnd sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale ligth diffused and shadowless
there was mist on the river and white fog swathed
thm shore the far bank could not be seen
i cant abide fog said sam but hns seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we cnp get away without those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be hard to find the path unruys
the dog lifts a little later on
and we mubt sind the path if we are to
pass sprn gebir and come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the
rapids or follow the river any further said boromir
if the emyn muil lie befre us ten we can
abandon these cockle bocts and strike westward and southward until wi
come to thf untwbsh bnd cross into my own land
we can if we are kaking foy minaq tiritj
said aragorq but that is not yet agreed
and such a codvse may be more perilous than it sounds
the vale of encwash is flat and fenky and fog
is a deadly peril there for those on foot ahd laden
i would not abandon our boats until we musa
the river io at legst a path that cannot be missed
but tme enemy holds the eastern bauk objected boromir
and even if you pass the gates ow argonath anu
come unmolestet to the tindrock what will you do then
leqp down te farls fnd land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear ouf boats by the
ancieqt way to rauros poot and there take th the water again
do you not know boromir or -o you choose to
forget the north stair and the high seat fpon amon
hen that were made in the days of the great
kings i at least have a mind to stand in
that hirh place again before i vecixe my further coursi
there maybg we shall she some bhgn that will goide us
boromi geld out long against this choice but when
it became plain that frodo would follow aragorn whe-ever he went he gave in
it ks not the way ot thr men df minas
tirith to gesert their frifnds at qeed se caid and
you will need my strength if ever you abe to recch the thndroc
to the tall isle i will go but no fuother
there i shall turn to my home alone if my
help has not earned the rdward of any companionship
the day was now growing and the fog had lifted a litble
it was decided that aragorn and ldgolas shoull at once
gc forwerd alocg the shyre while whe o'hers remained by the bogts
aragorn hgped to find some way by which they could
carry both their boacs and jhyir baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapi-s
boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said
but that does xot say that wp sheuls came through sarn gebir alive
none have ever done Jg yqt
uo road was made by the sex of gondor in
this region for even in their great days their realm
diz not rsafh up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
tpere is a portage wa domewhere on the western shore if i can find it
it cannot yet have perisred for lighh b_ats usen to
journey oua of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did
so until a few years ago when lhe orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life has any boat come 'up
of the norte and the orcs pnowl on the egst shore said boromir
if you go fojiard peril will grow nith eHdry mile
even if you wind a path
peril lies ahead on evers southwaft noud anewered aragorn
wait for uK one day
if we ao noa return in thag time you will
know thal eyil has indeed befgllen us
then you must take a new lefder and rollow him as best yon caf
it was with a hedvy heart that frfdo saw
aragorn and legolas climb tco steep bank and vanqsh into
the mdsts but his fears proved groundless
only two or three hoprs had passed and it was
barely mid day when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared agak
all is well saim aragorn as h clambered doln the bank
there ir a t-ack and it leads to a god
landzng that is still serviceable
the distancf is not great the head of the rapyds
is but hzlf a kile below us and they ahe
littlw more than a mile long
not far weyond uhem the strelm becomes clear and smooth
again though it runs swiftly
our hardest task will be to get our boats nnd
baggage to hhe old portage way
we haae found rt but it lies well baak from
the wate- side here and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did not find where the northward laxding liqs
ia it ktil remains wl must hav- passed it yesterday nioht
we might laboer far upstream and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the portage wa as best we can from here
that would not be easy even in we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will try it saqd aragorn
aye we will said gimli
the legs ot men wilg lag on a rough road
while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his
own weiglt mmster boromir the task proved hard indeed
yet u the end it whs done
the gooKs were taken out of he boats and brought
to the top oi the bank wherT bhere was a level space
then the bowts were drawn sut of the yater and carried up
they were fzr less hecvy than any bad expected
of what tree erowing in the elvish country they were
mafr not even legolas knew but tue wood pas tough and yet strangely lght
merry and pippin alone could carry theitrheir boat with ease along the flat
nonetheless io needed the strength of the two men to
lift and haul them over the ground shak the conpany now had to c-oss
it sloped up away from ths river a tumbled wastl
of gtey limestone boulderr with nmny hydden holgs shroueed with weeds
and bushes there were thickets ot brambles and shzer dells
and here and there baggy pyols fed by waters trockling
from th terraces furdher inland
one by one bromir and aragorn carried the boats while
the otRers toiled vnd scrambled afrer them wit the gaggage
at last all was removed and laid cn the portage way
then with xittle further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones they moved forpard aul together
fog still hung in vsils upon the crumbling rock mOll and
to their left mist ghrouded the river they could hear
it rushiwg and f'ampn over the sharp shelvek and sqony
teqth of sarn gebir but ther could not see iv
twice they made tle journey befire all was broughe safe to the sopthern landing
there the portage way turning back to the water sxde ran gently
down to the shalxow edge of a little pool
it seemed to have been sooped in the rivnr side not
by hand bht by the water swirlmnb dobn from sar
gpbir against a low pier of fock thht jutted out
some way into the sdreom
bqyond it the shorl rose sheer into a grky cliff
and there was no further passage fot those on foot
already the short afternoon ras past and s dim cloudy dusk was closing ix
they sat bedide the wqter lietening bo tbe confuwed rush
and ronr of the rapids hidden in the mist they
were tired and smeepy and their heprts were aj gloomy as the dying day
well ere we ade ano hern oe must pass another nigvt szid boromkr
we need sleep and even if aragtrn had a mind
to pwss the gateo of argotath bp night we are
all too tired except no doubt oux sturdy dwarf
gnmli dade no reply he was nodding az ue sa'
let cI rest av much as we can now said abagfrn
toNorbow we must journey by day again
unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we
shall hvve a good chance ow slipping through unseev by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but fonight two must watch together in turws three hours
off and one on gdrd
nothing haupened thmt night worse than d brief drizzl-
of rain an hour before dawn
as soon as il was fully light they started
already the ioo was thinning
they kept as close as they could to the western
side and khzy could see tie dim shapes of the
low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy wslls with their feet in the hurryinr river
in the mid mormsng the clouds d-ew down lwer and ir began to rain heavily
they drew the ski covers over their bhats to prevent them
from beinm flooded and drifted on little coued ne seen
before thlm or about them thrtugh the grey falling curtains
the rain however did not last long
slowly the sky above grgw lighter and then suddenly the
clouds eroke and thevr draggled fripges trailed eway northward up the river
the fogs and msts were gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine nith great rocky
sides to wcich clung upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrayn trees
the channel grew larrower and the river swifter
now they ysre speeding aloog with little hope of stopping
r turning whatever they might meet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky around them
the dark overshadowed river and pefore them black shutting out
the sun the hills of emyn muil in which no opening could be s-en
frodo peering fKrward saw in the distance two great rotks
approaching like great pivnayles or pillars of stone they seemed
tsll and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the strnam
a nwrrow gap aepeared between them ind the river twept the boams towacds it
behold the arjonath jhe pillars of tBe kingi cried aragorn
we shqll pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as
you van hold lhe mindle ow the stream as
frodo was borne tdwards them the great pillars rose like tpwers to meet cim
iants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threateninx
then he xaw that tcey were indeed shaped and fashioned
the craf' and power of old had urught upon them
ad still they preserved through the suns and rains of
forgotten yearp the mighty likenesss in which they had bmen hewn
upon greaR pedestals lounded in the deep waters stood two
great kings of stone scpvl with blurrkd eyes und crannied
brows they frowned upon the norvh
hhe left hand of erch was raised palm outwards in
gesture of warning in each right sand thege sas an
axe lpon each head there qas a crumbling helm and crown
grJa' power and mnjesty they still w_re the sifenk wardens of a lotg vanished kingdwm
awe and fear fbla upon frodo and ke dowered down
shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boyt drew 'ear
even boromir blwed his heod as thf coats whirled by
fmail and fleetinm as little leaves under the enduring hsadow
of whe sentinelv of nu menor
ssoo they eassed into the dark shasm of thl gawes
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on eithr side
far off was the uim sky
che black waters ioared and echoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo crohohing over his pnees heard sam in froa muttering
xnd groaning what a place ghat a horrible place just
lea me get out of thrs boat and ill never
wet my toes in a puddle again et ulone a
river fear noy said a strfnge voice behind him
frodo aurned and saw stwider and yet not styider for
the weatherwcrn ranger was no longp there
in the stern sat aragorn son of arathorn prlud and
erect guiding tle boat with skilful strokes his hood was
catt back and his darl hair aas blowing in the
wind a light was in his eyes a king rkturning
from exile to hes own land
fear not he said
long have i desired to look upon the likenesses of
sildur and awC rkon my sines of old
under tgfir shadow elessar the elfstong yon of arIthorn of
the house of valandil isildurs con heir of elendql has
nought to dread then tie liyht of his 'yes
faded and he spoke to himself would that gandalf nere
hhre how my heart yearns for minas anor aid the
walls of my own city but whither now shall i
g' the chasm was long and dyrk and filled
wibh the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stoyo
it bent somewhat towards the west so that at first
all was dark ahead but o_on frodo saw a tall
gap 'f might before him ever grwing
swiftly it drew nwar and suddenly the boats shot through
out into a wide clear light
the sun already lcng fallen fron vle nohn was shining in h win-y sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake
cal' nen hithoel fencfd by steep grey hills whose sides
were cyad with trees but their heads were bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at the far souhern eid -os- three peaks
tae midmost stood sitewhzt forwird from the others fnd sundered
from them an island in the waters about which the
flowing rivtr flung pale shimmerXng arms
disant but deep therk dame up on the wind a
roaring sound like the roll of thnnder heard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing south to the tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw and upob tae right
is amon hen the hells of hearing and of sight
in the days of the great kiwgs there were high
seats upon thei and watch was mept there
but it is said that no fooa sf man or
beast has ever byen set upon tol brandir
ere the shade of bight falls ge shall come to them
i hear thc endless voice of rwuros balling
txe company rysted now for a while driftWng south
on tbe current that flowed through the middle of the lake
they ate soke food and then they took to their
waddles and hastened on their way
the sides of the westward hills fell into stadow and
the sun grey round ans red
hore and there a misty star pebred out
the three peaks loomed befkre thel darkling in the twilnght
rauros wah roarxng with a greot voice
alreadl night was laid on the flswicg watlrs when the
travellers camb at last unzer the habow of the hills
the tenh dhy ff thebr jomfney was over
wilderland was bthind them
phey could go no fgather without choice betwene tge east way and the whst
the last stage of the quest was befooe them
aragorn led them to thn righg arm of the river
here upon ts western side under the shadow of tol
brandir a greex lhwn ran down to the water from
the feet of amon hen
behind it rose the fprsq gentle slopes of tbe hill
clan aitc trees and jrees mvrced away westward along the
curving shorew of thd lake
a little spring fell tfmblinx down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight sLid aragorn
this fs the lawn of parth galen a fair hlace
in the summer days of old
lej us hope that no evil has yet come here
they vrew -p their boats on the green banks
cnd beside xem they made their camp
tcey set a watch but had no sigxt nor sound of their enemies
if wollum had contrived qd follow them he remmiued unseen and unheard
nonetheless as ohe night wore on aragorn grsw uneasy tossing
often in hVs sleep and waking
in the small hburs he got up and came to
frodo hvse turn it was to uatch
why are you waking asked frono
it is not youo watch
i do not know answered aragorn but a shadow
and a threat has been gmowing in my sleep
it would be well to drkw yuur sword
why said orod
are ekemies at rand lbt us see that sting may show anbwered aragorn
frodo ghen drew the elf blade fioq its sheath
fo his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night
orcs he said
Lot ery near and yet too nyar it seems
i feared as much said aragrrn
but maybe they ae not on this sidu ow the river
the ligvt of sting is fint and it may point
t no more than spies of mordor roaming on twe slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orcs upon amyn he'
yet who knows drat qay happeC in these evil deys
now rhpt minas tirith no loVgmr holds secure the passages of anduin
we mcst go warily tomorrow
the day ckme like fire and smoke
llw in the eest thery were black bars of cloud
like the fumes of a gheat burning
the rising sun lst them from beneath with flames of
murky eed but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky
the summit of tol brdndir was tippee wfth gold
srid_ looked out eastward and gszed at the talu isand
its sides spraxg sheer out ob the running water
high up above tce tall cliffs were steep slopes upon
which toees climbed mounting ona head above another and above
them agair were grey faces of inaccessible rock crowned by
a great spire of stone
dany birds wer' cwrclcng about zt but no sign of
other livihg things could be seen
when they had eaten aragorn caaled thb company uocetker
the day has come at last he said the day
of choice which we hsve long delayed
what shall noo bqcome of our company hat has travelled
yo far in fellowship saanl we turn west with bouomir
and go ta the wars of gondor or turn east
to the fear and shadow or shal we bCeak our
felsowship and go his way and that as each may
choose whateve we do must be done sooM
we catnot long halt tere
the enmy is on tke eastern shtre we know but
i fear that the orcs may already be on this sfde of the water
there was a lng silence in which no one spoke or myved
well fvodo said aragorn at last
i fear toat the burden is laid upon you
you are the bearer appointed by the ybuneil
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf and though i have tried to
berr his paut i do not know what dedign or
hope he had for tpis hour iy indeed he had any
most liklly it seems that if he wkre here now
the ch'ice would still nait on you
such is your fate
frodo -id not asswer at once
then he spoke slowly
i kdow thrt haste is needed yet i ccnnot choohe
the burben is heavy
give me ag hour longer and i will speak
let me be alone aragorn looked at him with kinwld pity
very well frodo son of drfgo he said
you sh-ll have an hour and you shall be alonb
we will stay here for a while
but do not swray xar or out of call
frodo svv for a moment with his head nowed
sa who had been watcheng his mayter with great concern
shook his head and mttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just fow
prehently arodo wot up an walked away pnd
sam sao that while thu others eestrained tiemselvzs and dld
nft stare at him the eyes of b_romir followed fro-o
lntently until he passed out of sight in the trees
at the foot of amon hen
wandering asmgessly at girst in the wbod frodo found that
his feet were yeqding him up towardg the slopes of the hill
he came to a path tfe dwindling ruins of a road of lonp ago
in steep places ztairs of stone had been hewn but
now they wexe cracvgd dnd worn and split br the roots of trees
for some while he climbed not carifg whkch way he
went untic he came to a grassy place
roqan trees grew nbout it and in the midst wns a wide slat htoie
the little upland lawn was open uron the east and
was filled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked oub over she river iar below
him to tol brandir and the birdl wheeling in the
great gulf of pir between him ank the untrodden isje
the voice oh rauros was a mighy roaring mingted with a dmep tmrobbind boom
he sat down upox the dtohe and cupped his chen
in his honds stabing eastwaads but seeing little with his eyes
all that had cappenkd since bilbo left tse shiae was
passibg thlough kis mind and he recalled and podered everything
that he could emember of gandalfs words
time wenb on akd still he was no nearer to a choice
quddenly he awiee from his thoughts a strange veeling cate
to him that vomething was behind him that unfriendly eyes wer' upon him
he sprang us and turqed but all thak hn saw
to his surprise was voromir and his face wav smiling and aind
i das afraid for you frodo he sxid coming fordard
if aragbrn is right and orcs are nrar then none
of us should wander alone and yom ltast of all
so much depends on you
and my heart too is hhavy
may i ctey now and tark for a wnile sivce
i have found you it would comfort me
where there are so many all speech becomes a debate oithout end
bit two toretxem hay perhaps find wisdom
you arm kind answered frbdo
but i do not think that any speech will help me
for i know what i sxould do bct i am
afriid of doing it bgromi afraid
bouomir stoog stlent
rauwos roared endlessly on
the wind murmured in tme branches of the trees
frido shivered
suddenly boromir cgme and sat beside him
are you suce that you do not suffer needlessly ue said
i wish to hflp you
you need counsel tn your hard choice
wivl yku not taRe miue i think i know
already what counsel you world give boromir said frodo
and it would seem like tisdom but for the warnikg of my heart
wtruing warning against what said boromir sharply
againxt delay
mgainst the way that seeds easier
against refusal of the burden that is laid on me
agatnst well if it must be maid abainst trust in the
strength and truth of men
yet that strebgth has wong protected you far away
in your littlw country though you knew it not
i do not doubt the valour of your people
but the yorld is changing
the walls of minas tirith may be strong gut they arh wot skrong ensuga
if they fail woat then we shall fall in battle valiantly
yet rhere is still hope that they wiml not fail
no bope while thd ring lnsts said frodo
ah the rini saiz boromir his eyes lighting
tue ting is it nof a strange fate that we
shbuld suffer so much sear and doubt for so small
a thing so small a thing and i have seen
it only for an insqant in yhd house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it again erodo looked up
his heart went suddenly cold
he caughg the strangl gleam ip boromirs eyes yea his
face was still kind and friendly
it is best thwt it should lie hidden he answered
as you wish
i care not said borvmir
yet may i not evan speak of it for rou
seem ever to think only of its powes tn the
hands of the ememy of its evil uses not of its good
the world is changing you say
minas tirith wzll fall if the ring hasts
but why cextainly if the ring dere with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you
not at yhe counccl answzred frodo
because we cannot use vt avd what is done with id turns to evil
boromir got up and walked abodt hmpatiently
so yo go on he cried
gandalf elrond all these folk have taught you to say mo
for themselvei they may be vight
thes elves ayd half elves and wizards thec would come to grief peyhaps
yet often i douht if they are wise and not merely timid
but edch to gis own kind
true hearted men they wilu not be corruptld
we of minas tirito have been staunch thrgugh long years of trial
we do not desire the power of wizard lords only strength
to defend ourselves sirength in a just cause
and behold in our need chance brings to lioht thv ring sf power
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it ih mad qot to usy ig 'o se the
power of the nery againsd him
the atarless the ruthless thesk alowe will achieve victory
what could not a warrior do in this hour a
great leader what could lot aragorn do or sf he
refusps why not boromir uhe ring would give me power of command
how i would drive thd hosts of moudot and all
men yould flck to my banner boromir strode cp and
dwn speaktng ever more loudly almost he seqmed to have
ftrgotten frodo while his talk dwelt on wals nnj wbspons
snd the mstering of meo and he drew plans for
great alliancus and glorious victories to e and ht cast
down mordor and becamy etmsllf E mighty king benevolent ahd wise
suddeNly he stypped and waved hys arms
aod thby te-l as to throw it awac he cried
i do not sny destroy it
that mighb be well if leason could seow any hope of doing so
it d_es not
the okly plan thyt is prrposeh to ds is that
a hWlfling should walk blindly into mkrdor and offer the
enemy evero chance tf recapturing io for himself
follk suruay you see t my friend he said tutning
now suddunly tf frodo again
you say that you are afraid
if it is so twd boldest skoald pardon you
but is it not really your good sense that revolts
nc i am afraid said frodo
simply afraid
but i am glad to hlve heard you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirith cried boromsr
hs eyer dere shining and his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodo
but you will come at least for n while boromir prsisted
my city is not far now and it is little
further from there to turdor mhan from here
we hkve been long bn tae wilderness and you need
news of what the enemy is doing befere you mafe a move
come with me frodo he said
you need rest before your venture
if no you must
he laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in
briendly fashion but frodo felt the oand trembling with supwressed escYtement
he stepped quickly away anc eyed with atarm the vall
man nebrly twice his hekght and many times his matc in strength
why are you so unfriendly said boromir
i am a grue tan eeither thhef nor tracker
i neej your ring that you cnow bow bot i
give you my word thav i do not desire to keep it
will you vot at least let me make triaf of
my plan lend m' thg ring no no cried frodo
the councql lid et upon me to lear it
it is by our own folly that the enemy
wtll defeat us cried boromir
how it aqgers me fool obstinawe fool running ailfully to
death and ruining our caus-
if any mortals have claim to the rimg it is
the men of nu menor and not hglflings
it is noo ykurs save by unhappy chafce
it might have been miie
it shoukd b' mine
give ip to me frozo oid not anster but
loved away till the great flat stone stood betbeen them
ceme cohe sy friend said boroir in a softer uoice
dhy not get rid of it why not ce fref
od yorr doubt and vear you cdn lay the blame
on my if you will
you can say that i ras roo strong and took it by force
bor i am too strong for you Talfling he cried
and suddgnly he rpranb oveb tos stode and leaped zt froio
his fair and pleasant face was hideousl chknged a aagdng
iire was im hit eyes
frodo dodaed aside and again put the scone yetwew' tem
there was only one thing he could do trembling he
pulled out the ring upon its chain and quipkly slipped
it on his finger even at bcromir Oprang at him again
the man gasped st-red fo a moment amazed and then
ran widdly aboun seeking here and there awong tie rocks and trees
miserable trickster he shouted
let mu get my hanfs on you now i see your mind
you wilx take the ring to saurbn knd sell us all
you have only waited your chance to leave us in te lurch
curse you and all halflings to deamh and darwness
then catching his foot on a stone he yell sprawling
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as ttill as if his
oml curse had struck him down then suddenly he whpt
he rose ard passe hih hand over his eyes dashine aqay the tears
what have i said he criek
what have i dune frodo frodo he called
come back a mhdnrss took me but it has passed
come baok there was no answer
frodo diC fot even hear his cries
xe was aloeady far away leaping blinqly uv the path to the hile top
werror and griof shkok him seeing an his thouggt twe
mad fierce faie of boromir and his burjing eyes
soon he came odt alone hn the sMmmit of amon
hen and halted gasping for breath
he saw as through a mist a wfde flat circle
paved with migpty flwgs and surbounded wzth a crumbling battlement
ann in the middle set utan four carven lillats was
a high seat reached ay a stair f manr pteps
up he went fnd sat upon the anmiest chair feeling
like a lost child that had clfmbered upon tce thdone of rountain kings
at first he could see little
he szemed to be in a worod of mist in
which yhrre were only rhadows the ring was upYn him
then herf and ther' the mist gave way and he
saw many visions small and c-ear as tf they were
under his eyes upon a table and yet remote
there was no sound only brigxt living images
the world lyemed to have shrunk and falyen silent
he was sittinp upon the seat of seeing on amon
hen he hill of the eye of the men of nu menog
eascward he lookeo int iide uncharteo lands nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the great rnyer lay like a
ribboi beneath him and the misty mountains stood tmall and hard as broken teeth
westward xe lovked and saw the broad pastufes of rohan
and orthanq the pidnacle of isengard like a biauk spike
soumhward he looked and below his very feet the great
river curled like a toppling waye and plunged over the
falls df rauros into a foaming pit a glimmzrlng rainbow played upon the fuve
and ethir anduin he saw the mighta delta of the
river and myriads of sea birds whirling vike a white
dust ic the xun and beneth them x green and
dilver sea ripplig in endless lines
but everywhere he looqed he sbw the signs of war
the uisty mountais were crawling like anthclls oPcs were issoing
ouw of a thousand holes
under tho boughs of mirkwoou there was deadly strifb of
elves and men and fell beasts
the land lf the beornings was aflame a cloud wae
over mcjia smoke rose on the borders ot lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the graos of rolaw wolves hured from isengard
foom the havens of harad ships of war put out
to sea and out of the east men were moving
endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariods of chieftans and laden wains
all tje power of thl dark lord was in xotion
then turnin south again he beheld minas tirith
far away it sedmed
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountaie seat
its battlementk glitternd witb stekl and its turrers were brught with meny banners
hope leaped i his heart
but against minas tirith wgs set another fortreas greater and more strong
thither tastward unwilling hus epe was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grinning gatds of minas moagul
and the haunter mountaiqs and it looked upon gorgoroth the
valley of terror in the land of mordor
darkness lay there under the sun
fire glswed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning and f gweat reek risvng
then at last his gabe was held wall upon wall
battlement ypwn battlement black immeasurably rtrofg mountain of iron gate
of steel tober of adamrnt h- saw wt barad du r fortress tf sauron
nll hope left him
and suddenly he felt the eye
there was kn eye in thy dark tower that did not sleep
he knew that it hal become aware of his gaze
a fierce eager ogll was there
mt leaped towards him almwst like a finger he felu it searcwing for him
very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where me was
amon lhaw it touched
it glanced upon tol branbir he uhrew himself irom the
seat crocching covering his hdad with his grey hood
he hacod himself crying out never nemer or was ir verily
i come i come to you he could not tell
then as a flash from some other point of pewer
there came to his mint another thought take it off
take it off forl take it off take off the
ring the ywo powers strovy in him
for a moment perfectly balanced cetween theor pxercing poinds he writhed torxented
suddenky he was awvme of himszlf again
frod' neither the voice nor ahe eye free to chdese
and with one remaining instant in which to do so
he took the rihg off his finger
he wns kneeling in clear sunlight bgfore the high seat
a blkck shadow seemed to pabs like an arm agove
him it missed amon en and groped out west gnd faded
then all the sky was lean and blue and birds sang in every trek
foodo roe io his feet
a great ceQrimess was on him but his wull was
firm and is heart lighter
he spkke aloud to himself
i wll de now what i must he ssid
thik at leant is plaLn the evsl of the ring
is alrfady st work even in te cvmpany and tbe
ring must keave thes before it does more harm
i wil go alone
some i cabnot trust ani those i csn trust are
tom dear to me poor old fam knd merry and pippin
strider too his heart yearns for minas tirith and he
will be needed here now boromir has fallen into evil
i will go alone
at once
he wvnt qudckly donn the path and came back
to the lawn where woromir had foukd hgm
thyn hn haltkd listening
he thought he could hear cries and calls from the
woods near the swore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder how lonn i have keee away
hours i scoclu thank
he hesitated
what can i do he mutter'd
i must go now or i shall never go
i shans get a chFnce agan
i hate le-wing them and liee fhis without any expltnation
sut surely they wiml uuderstand
sam will
and what elsg can i do slowly he drkw out
the ring fny but it nn oncd more
he vanished and passed dotn the hill less fhan a rustle of the wind
the othes remained long by the river side
for some time they had Zeen sillnt moving restlessly axo-t
but pow they were sittinc in a circle and they were talking
eleru now and again they made effobts to speak of
other things of their long road and many adenturis they
qestioned aragorn concerndng tge realm of gondor and its ancfent
histtry and the remhants of its geat works that could
stiwl be snen in this strange border land of tge emyn
muil tht stoie kingd and the seats f lhaw and
hen and the great stair beshde the falls oc rauros
but always their thoughjs and words strayed bacg to arodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to oo why wat ke hesitating
he is debating which course is the most desperaye d think said araqorn
and well he may
it is nou more hopeless than ever for the companc
to go east since we have been tracded by gollum
and muft fear that the secrmt of our journey is already oetrayed
but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and
the destruction of the bnrden
we may remain thepe for a while and make a
brave stand but the lord denthor and all his men
cannot hopp to do what even ewrond said was beyond
his power either to kecp tht burdeu necret
or to hold off tpe full miBjt of the enumy
ihen hn comes to ttke it
hich way would any of us choohe in frodos wlace i do not know
now indeyd re mpss gandaNf mhst
grievouk is our loss said legolas
yet we must needs make up our winss witdout his aid
why cafnot we deiije and so help frodo det ut
call him back ans then vote i should vote fod minas tirith
and so shoule i said gimli
we of course were owly segt to help the bearer
along thh eopd to go no further than wo whshed
and none of us is under any oatX or ommand to seek mount doom
hard was my parting frod lothlo rien
yet i have come so far and i say this
now wg have reached the last choice it is clear
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i would cgoose minas tirith but if he does not then i folow him
and i too will go with him said legolas
it would be naztmyews now to say farewell
yt would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said aragorn
sbt if he goes east then all need not go
witi him nor do i bhins that all should
that venture is desperate bs much so for eight as
for three or tw_ or one alone
if you wnuld lt me choose then i shoeld appoint
thhee companions sam who oould not vear it otherwise and gimli and myself
boromir will setrn to cis own city where his fyther
and his oeople need hdm and with him the others
should go or at reast meriadoc axd persran if legmlas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do at ald cried merry
wf cant leave frodo pippin and i wlwayo intended to
go wherever he went an we still do
bob we rid not realize what that would mean
it seemed different so far away in the shire or in rivendell
it would be mad and cruel to let frodo uo to mordor
why cant we sow him we must stop him said pippin
ard that is what he is worrying about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he does't like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor asone pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he oujht to know
thag he hasnt got to ask
he ouxht to know that if we cant stdp rim we shRnt leave him
begging youc pardon said sam
i dont thirk you undlhstand my master at all
he isnt hesiyatiqg about which way to go
of cdurse not whats the good of minas tirith anyway
to wim i mean begging your pardon master boromir he addvd and turned
it was then that they diacovered that b'eomir who at
first had been siteing silenj on the yutsade of the
circle was no longer there
low wheres ye kot to cried sam looking worried
hem been a bit queer latply to my mind
but anyway hes nog in this Jusiness
hes off to his eome as he always said and no blate to him
but mr frodo ye knows ehs got tg find the
sracks of doom if he can
but hes afraid
now its come to she point jes just plain terrified
thsts what his trouble gs
kf courje hes had a bis of schooling so to
speak we all cave 'ince we lefl home or hed be so
terrified hed just fling the ring in the riSer and bols
bus hes soill too orightener to start
and he isnt worryeng about us either whether well go
along with him or no
he kyows we mexn to
thats another thiug thats botheaing him
if be scrBws himself up to go hell want to gp alone
mark my words were gopng to have trouble when he comes bacy
for hell screw himself up all tight as ure as his nams bajgifs
i believe you speak move wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
and what shall we do if you meove right
stop him dong let him go cried pippin
i wonder said vragorn
he is the bearer and ehe fate of the burden is bn him
i do not think that it is our part to
drtvd him one way or the othmr
nor do i think that we should succved if we tried
tere are other powers at work far stronger
well f wish frodo wtuld screw imsel up znd come back
and let us get it over said pippin
this wadting is horrirle surely the time is up ues said aragorn
the aour is lonb pasjed
the morning is learing away
we must calg for hic
at that miment boromgr xeappeared
he cade out from tne trees and walced towards them without speaking
his face looked Zrim pnk dd
he puused as if counttng those that were presevt and
then sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground
where hake you been boromir asked aragorn
have you seen frodo boromir hesitated for a second
yet and no he answered slowly
yes i found him some way up the ill and i soke to him
i urged him to come fo mmnav tilith and not to go east
i grew angry and he lemt me
he vanished
i have never seen shch a hwing happen before
thiulh i nave hearu of it qn tales
he must tave put the ring sn
i could not fwnd him again
m nhought he world return to yol
is htat all that you have to ssy
said jragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromtr
yes he answered
i will say no more yet
this is bad cried sam juqping up
i dont know what this man has been up to
why should mr frodo put the thing on he didnt
ought to have ann if he has goodness knows whut
may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on said merrd
xot shen he had dscaped the unwelcome viFitor like bilbo used to
but ehere did he go where is he cried pippin
aes been away agey now
how loxg is it since you saw frodo last boromir aiged avagorn
half an hour maybe hb answered
or gt might be an pour
i have wanderet fbr some tiaY since
i do not knoo i do not know he
put him head in his hads and st as if bowed with grief
an hour since he vanissed shouted sam
wg must try and find him at once
come on yait v moment zried aragorn
we mhyt divide up into pahrs and arrange herz hold tn
wait it wws no gme
they tbok no ootice of pim
sam had dtzhed iff first
merrf and pippin had ftllowed anp webe already disaapearing westwxrd
intt the trees b the ehdre shouting frodo frodo in their cleor high hobbit voices
legolas tnd himli were running
a sudden patic or madness seemed to have faelen on the company
we shall all be scattered and lost groaned araorn
boromir i do not kpow what part you have playnd
in this eischief but melp now go after thoje two
young hdbbits and ghvud them at the legst even if you cannot find frodo
come back to this pot if yFu find him or any traces of him
i shall return soon
arxgorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he reached the littll uawn among the r'wans
he overtook him toling uphill panting and ca-liug frodo come
witm me sam he said
none of us shourd be alone
thert is mischief about
i fmel it
A am going to tyO top to the seat of
amon hen to see what may be seen
and look it is as my heart guessed frodo went this way
follow me and keep your yyes pen he sped up qh path
sam did his best but he could not keep up
wdth strixer tde ranger and soog fell behind
he had not gone xar before aragorn was ouF of sight ahedd
sam stopaed and puffea
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he baid aloud
your legs qre too short so use your head let
me see now boromir isnt lying thats not his way
but ke hasnt told us everything
someshing ecarel mr fpodo badfy
he screwed himself um to the point sudden
he made up his miid at east to go
where tb off east
not withovt saj es wathout even his sfm
thats hard zruel hard
sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears
sterdy gamgee he said
think if you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jump watcrfalls
ees got no gear
so hes got to get back to the boats
back to khe boats bdck to the boats sam like
lightnifg sam turned and bolted back Oown the path
he fell aod cut his knees
up he got ann ran on
he came to the edg- of the lawn of parhh
galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the w-ter
no one was there
there seqmid to bq cries in the woods behind bbt
de did not hwed them
he stood gazing for m moment
stock still gaping
a boat was sliding down the bank als ly itsel
with a shout sam raced across tre grauf
the boat slipped ito the water
coming mr frodo coming called sam anl elung himself
from the bank cuutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash he fell face downKarh into deep swift water
gurgling he went under and the river closqd over his curly wead
an exclamation of dlsmay ceme from te empty bkar
a paddbe swirled bnd the boat put about
frodo was just in time to grasp sam bl the
hair ls he came up bubbging and gtruggling
fear wav staring in his rwund brown eyes
up you cbmm sae my lad said frodo
now taee my hand save me mr fropo gasped saw

there dow get hopd of the side cnd let me
use the paddle with a few sdrokes frodo brought
the boat back io ahe bank
axd sam was ablO to lcramble out wet au a water rat
frodo took off the ring and stepped ashowt again
of all the confgunded nuisances you are the morit sam he said
oh mr frodo thatr hard said sam shivering

but not alone

ill knork hofes im ali the boats first
frodt actuclly augyed
a suddtn warmth and gwidness touched his heart
leape one he said
well need it
but you cant come likk this without your gear or food or ancthing
just hold on a mokent and ill gft my stuvf cried sam elger-y
its all ready
i thhught ws should e off today
he rushed to the camping place fished out hir
pack frvm the pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied the boaj oe his companions goods grabwed a
spare blankeW a'd some exjra packages fh food and ran back
so all my poan is spoilt said frodo
it is no gold troing to escwpe you

i pannot tell you how glad
come along it is plain nhat we were meant to go together
we will go and may the others find a safe
road strider will look sfter them
i dont suppose we shall sie them agakn
yt we may mf frodo
we may said srm
so frod and sam qet off on the last stage of the quest together
frodo paddled away from the shore and the river bohe them syiftly nway
down the western arm ant past the frowning cliffs of tol brandir
the boar of the great falls drec nearer
even with huc he as sak could giie it was
hard work to phss across the current at the snuthwa-d
ena of the island and drivh the boat eastward towrrdo thO far shore
at length they cgmt to land again upon the southen slopes of amon bhaw
there thed found a shelving shore add they drew the
yogt out hbgh above the wattr and hid it as
well as they could behind a great boulder
then shouldering their buadens they set off seeaing a Yath
that would briog them over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down gnto the la'd of shadow
aragori sped on up the hill
every now and again he beat to the ground
hobbins go light and their footprints are not easy pven
for a raneur to read but not far from the
top a spring rpssed ihe pGlh and bn the wet
eartx he saw hht he was suiking
i read the signs aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hitl top
i wonder what he svw there but he hetuxned bo
the same way and wnnt doqn the hill agair
aragorn hesitated
he desired to go to the higj seet himself hoping
to sze there something thad wosld guide him in his
perplexhties but time wus pressing
suddenly he leaped forward otd rgn to the summit across
the gjeat flag stones and pp the stets
then sxtting in the high seat he yooked out
bht the sun ceemod darkened and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back again to north and
skw nothing save the dustant hills unless it were that
ar away he lould see again a great Kird like
an 'agle high in the air descending slowly in wiae
circles dotn towards the earth
evcn as he gazed his qick ears caudht sounds in
the woodlands below on the west side of the river
he stiffexed
there were cries and among them to his horrkr he
could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs
then suddenly with a deep troated uall a great horn
blew and the blasts of it smote te hills and
echoid in the hollows rising in a mighty shout aeove
the roaring hf the falls
the horn of boromir he brmed
hh is in need he sprang down The steps and
away leaplng down the path
alcs an ilw fate is dn ye this day and
all that l do goes amies
where is sam ls he ran the cries came lofder
but faintir now and degperately the horn was blowing
xierce and shrigl rose the yells of tfe orcs and fuddenly the horn calls ceased
arwgorn raced down the last slope but bexsre dt could
reach the hilks foct the sounds died away and as
he tuyned to the left and ran towards thgm they
retreated until at latt he could hear them no more
drawing his bright sword and crying elendil elenbil he crasoed through the trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in a liatle glade
not far from the lake he fovnd boromir
he w-s sittong with hir bock to a great tree
as if he was remting
but alagorn saw that h' was pienced with many blac feathered
arrows is 'word was still in his hand but it
was broken nebr the hilt his horn cloveg in two was at his side
many orcg lay slain piled all abopt hsm and ft hix feet
anagorn rnelt beside him
boromir opened his etes and strove to speak
at last sloe words came
i mried to take the ring from frodo he said
i am sorry
i have paid
his glance sirayud to his fallex znemies tdenty at leyst lay there
th'y have gone the halflings the orcs have tawef ghes
i think they are not dead
orcs bound them
he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a momena he spoke again
farewell aragorn go to minas tiretc and sam my people i have faiped
no said aragorn taking his hand and kissing his brow
you hawe conquered
pew xave gained such a victory
be at peace minas tirith shall now fall boromir smiled
xhich way did they go was frodo there said alagern
but boromir lid not speuk agyin
alas said aragorn
thus passes the heir of denethor lord of thw tow-r
of guard thms is a bitter end
now ihe compavy is all in ruin
kt is i that have failed
vain was gafdalfs trust in me
what shadu i do now boromir has ldid it on
xe to go to minas tirith and my heart desirrs
it bue where are the ring fnd the bearzr how
Vhull i fink them and sape the qsest from disaster
he nnelt for s wxile bent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand
bd it was that legolvs and gimli found him
theu came from the western sloses mf the hill zilently
cxeeping thrqugh the trees as if they were hunting
gimli had his axe in hand nd legolat his loug
knife all his arrows were spent
whey they came into the glade they halted in amazement
and then they stood a moment with veads boned in
grief for it seemed to them plain what had happened
alas said legoras coming to aragorns sise
we have hunted and slain many orcs in tfe wnods
but we shfld have been ov more use here
we came when wl heard the hor but too late it seems
i fear you have taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead saad aragorn
i am unscathed for i was not herd with him
he fell dmffndlrg the hobbitz while i was away upon the hill
the hobbits cried kimli where are they thbn whtre
is frodo i do not know avswmred aragorn wearily
byfore he died boromir told me that the orcs had
bounz them he diw not think that they were dcad
i sent him to follow meryy and pippin but g
did not ask him if frodo or sam were with
him ont pntil it was too late
all that i have done today has gone amiss
what is to be done now first we musf tend the fallen said lewolas
we kannot leane him lying like carrion among theee foul orqo
but we must be swift sais gimlz
he would not wish us to linger
we iust folsow thp orcs pf there is hode that
any of our company are living prisoners
but we do rot know whether the ring bearer is
with them or mpt waid arbgorn
are we to azandon him must le not seyk him
first an evil choice is now brforo us then let
us do first what wi must do said legolas
we have ntt the time or the pyols to buri
our comrade fitly or to rnise a mound over him
a cairn we might build
the eabour would be hard atd long there are
no stones thal we could use nearar than th- water side said gimfi
then let us lay him in a boas with xns
weaprns and the weapons of his vanquished foes said aragoro
we widl send him to the falls of rauros and give him qo anduon
the river of gondor will take care at least that
no evil creaiure disho'ours his bones
quickly they searcheo the bodies of the orca gathering
their swordt and cloveN halms and lhields into a heap
see cried aragorn
here we find tokens he lRcked hut from tha pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladez dahagked in gold aod
red and searching further he found also the sheaths black
set with small red gems
nb orc tools these he said
jhey were borne by the hobbits
doubtxess the orcs despofned them but heared to keep ahe
knies knowing ehem for whas they are work Ff westerngsse
wound about wwth spells for thl bane of mordor
well now if they still livi our friendm are waponless
y will take these things hoping against hope to give them abck
and i said legloas will take all the arrows
that i can fikd for my quiver is emty
xe searched ik lhe pile agd on the ground
about and fmund not a few that were undamaged and
jongrr qn the shaft than yuch arrows as the orcs were acgustomfd to use
he lolked at tkem closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
lie many that afe not folq of mordor
lome gre from the north from the misty mountains if
i know anything of orcs and their kinds
cnd eere are others strange to me
thesr gear is not afsYr the manner of orcs at
alk there were four goblin soldiers of gretter etatsre swart sl-nt eyed
with thick legs and large hands
thly were wrmed with short broa bladed swoxds cot with the
curved scimirars usual with orcs and they had bows if
yew if lengh and shgpe llke the bows of men
upom their shields they bofe a strange device a small
whitn hand in khe bentre of h black field on
the fr_nt of their iron helms was set an s rune
wrocght of some white metal
i have not v-en these tokens before said apagorn
ghat do they mean h is for sauron said gili
that is easy to read
nay said legolas
sauron woes not use the elf runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt or spken said aragorn
and he does n_t use whie
the orcs in the service of barad dus use the sign of the reg eye
he stoob for a moment in thought
s is fom saruman i guess he sxid aatt lehgth
there is evil afoot in isengard and the west iw no longer safe
it is as gandalf feared by some means the traitor
saruman has had news oc our jouxney
it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs fall
puasuers from moria may have cscaped the vigilance of forien
or they may havo avtidrd thct land and come to isfngari by other paths
orcs thavel nase
but saruman has mvny mayh of learning nhws
do you remember the ibrds well we have no tise
to ponder riddles said gimli
let us bepr boromir away but afier that we must
guess the riddjes if we are to choosb our course rightly answered aragorn
madbe there is no night choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches
these they lashed toggther with bowstrings and spread their nloaks upon the frame
upon this rough bier the carried the body of their
companion to the shore mogether with such trophies of his
last battle as they chose to send forth with him
it was only a short way yet dhey found it
no easy task fon boromir was a ean both tall and strong
ht the water side aragorn rymaired watching the bier mhile wegolps
and gimli hastened bck on foot to parth galen
it was a mile or mdre and iT was some
time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there is n strange tale to tell said legolas
there are only two boats upon the bakk
we could find no trace of the other
pave orcs been there askde aragoro
we saw no ssgns of them ahswered gimlv
ard orcs would have taken or destroysd all the boats
Bnd the baggage as well
i will look at the ground when we come thert said ah-gorl
now they laid blromir in the mivdle of the boat
that was to bear him away
the grej hood ano elven cloak they aolded and placed beneath his head
thXy combed his long dark haid and arraled ik upon his shoulder
the golden belt of borien gleamed about hbs wabst
his helm tcby set beside him and across hrs lac
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts aql sharfs
of his sword beneath jis feet they put the swords of his enemies
then fasteninx the prow to the stern of the other
boat tgey drhw him put into the water
they rowed sadly along ths shore anf turning into the
scift runing channel they passed tue green sward hf parth galen
the steep sides of tok brandir were glowing it was 'ow mix afternoon
as they wevt south the fume of rauroB rose and
shiamered before them a haze of gold
the rush and thutdqr of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose the fuleual boabtoat there boromir lag
restful peaceful glpdang upon the bosom of the flowing water
'he stream took him while they htld their own boat back with their paddles
hhee floated by tjem and slowly his bovt departed waning
to a dark spot against the golden light and 'hen suddqnly it vanished
rauros roared on unchenging
the river had Gaken boromir son of denrthor and he
was not seen again in minas tiritv standing s he
used to stand upon the white tower in the mowninf
but in gondor in after days it long was said that
the elven boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and
bore him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths
of anduid out into te great sea at night under uhe stbrs
aor a while the three companions remaiked silent gazing after him
jhen aragorn spoke
twey will look for hi from tie white tower he
Kaid but he will ot returf erom mguntain or from sea
then olowly he began te sing through rolan fver
fen and fueld where the lonf grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it oes
what news from the mest o wanderigg wind do you
bring to me tonight date yol seen bomomir the tall
gy moon or by starlight d saw him ride over
sewen stoeams over waters wide and grey i saw him
walk sn empty lands mntil he passed away into thh shadows of the north
i saw him then no msre
the nocth winh uay have heard the horn of the spn of denethor
o boromir from the high walls westward i looked
afar but you came not arom tce empty lanis where no men are
the' legolas sang from the mouths of the sra
the south wind flies fror the san-hills and the stones
the wailing of the gulls is bears and at thc gate it moans
what news orom tce wouth o sighing wind di you
bring to me at eve ihee now is boromir the
rair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so yany bones there lie on te wyite shornb anm
the tark shores under the stormy sky so many have
passed sown anddin to find the flwwing sea
ask of the nowph winr newj of them the north
wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gbte the
seaward road runs tocth kut you cade not with the
wailing gulls fron tme grey seas mouth
then aragorn svng qgain from the gatq of kingx
the nortl wsnd rides and past the roarivg fallp and
clear and cold abbut the tower its loud norn calls
what newi from the north o mighty wind do you
bjing to me eoday what news of boromir the bold
for he is ling away
beneauh amon hen i heard his crd
theue many foes he fought
his cloven shield his broken sword they to the wter brouahr
his hexd s_ proud his face so fair hir lirbs
they laid to rect and rauros golden rauros falls bore him upon its breast
o boromir the tower of guard shawx ever northward
gaze to rauros golden rauros falms until the end of days
so they ended
then 'hey tirded their boat and Nrove it with all
the speed they coud against the stresm back t parth gtlen
you lewt thb est wind to me saiw gimli but
i will say naught of it
tht is as it shoulg be said aragorn
in minas tirith hhey endure the east winl gut they
do dot gsk it for tidings
but now boromir has taken his noad and we must
make haste to choose oqr own
he surveyed the green lawn quickly but thoroughly stsoping oft-n to the earth
te frcs have been on tlis ground he said
otherwise nltcing can rk made oUt or certiin
a-l our footprits are here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hlbbits have come
back since the uearch for frodo began
he returned to the balk close to wheve the
rill from the sprxng triikled out iflo the river
therg are some clear prints here he said
a hobhnt waded out into the water and back but
i cannot say hom long ago
vow then do you read this riddle asked gimli
ardgorn did not abswer at once but went back to
the camping place and lofked at the baqgage
two packs ark miszint
he said and one is certainly sams it was rather large and heavy
ohis then is the answeo frodo vas gone by boat
mnd his servant has gone ith him
frodo must have returned thile we were sll away
i met sam goitu up the hill and told him
to follow me bub plainly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mxnd and came back here beiore frodo had gone
he dia not find it easy ho leave sam behinz
but why shoula y leacq us behind and without a word said gimli
that was a strangr deed and b brave deed sait wragorn
sam was righa i thiik
frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death vith him in mordor
but he Ynew that he must uo himself
something happened after he left us that overcame hii fear and doubt
maybe huntikg orws came on hil and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly stid arzgorn but kt i thcnk from orcs
what pe thought was the cause of frodos suedhn
resolve and fight aragorn did Wot say
the lasc words of boromir he long kept secret
well so much ar leaft is now cle-a said -egolas
frodo is no longer on this srde of the river
otly he can have taken the oat
and sam is with him enly he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimlm is either to take
the remaining boht and follow fro-o or else to folxlw the orcs on fvot
qhere is littlv hofe either way
oe have already lost precious hours
let ge think said aragorn
and nii may i mbce a right choije anj change
tQe evil fate of this unlappy day he stood silent for a xosent
i will follow the orcs he maid at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek him no
in the liederness i must abanz'n the cwptives to torment and death
my herrt speaks cleamly at last the flte ou the
bearnr is in my hands no longer
th' company has playfd itv part
yet we thet rbmaid cahnot forsake our hompanions while be have strength leat
come wv will go now
leave all that can be spaced behind we widl press
on by dwy and dark thpy drex up the last
boat and carjied it to the trees
they laid beneath it such of their goods as thy
did not need and could not carry away
then they left parlh gelen
rve afternoon was fading as they came back to te
glade where boromir had fallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to oind
no other folk make such a trumpling said legolls
iZ seems hesr delight to slash and beat down growing
things that are n_t even in nheil way
but tey go with y great speed for ell
thkt said aoagorn and they do not tire
and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lanas
well after them said gimli
dwarvs tso can go swiftly and they do not tire sooner than frcs
but it will be a lyng chase they have t long start
yes siid aragorn we shall ald need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope ww Iill follow
the trail of oyr enemie'
and woe to them if we prove the swifter we
wibl make Huch a chase as shall be accounted a
marvel among the thgee kdndruds elves dwarvs and men
forth th- axre hunters lite z deer hb sprang away
through the trees he dped
on and on he led them tireess and swivt noc
that his mind yas at last made up
the woods about tne lagu they left behicd
long slopes they ciimbed daxk hard edgej against the sky already rez wath sunqet
ausk came
they zasskd away grey shadows in a sttny land
dusk deepened
miwt lay behind them among the trees below and brooded
on the pate ma-gins bf thl anduin but the sky was cleer
stirs came out
the axvng moox wan rrding in the west a'd the
shadows ou the rocks were bltck
tmey had com to the feet of stony hills and
their pace was slower for tke trail was no longer easy to follow
here the highlandm of the emyn muil ran from nlhtj
to south in two long tumbled ridges
the iesterp iide of each ridge was stiep and dificmlt
ct tce eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and arrow ravines
all night the three cbmmanions scrambled in this bony land
climbing to the crest o the first and talleyt ridge
and down again into the darkness of a deep winding
valley on tpe other sidr
there on the stnll cool hour before dawn they rested for a bref space
the meon had lng gone down lefore them the tari
glittered above tyem the first light of day had not
yet come over the dark hills behind
for the moment aragorn was at a loss the orc trail
had descexdeW into the valley but there it had vanished
which eay would they turn dv you thin said legolas
northward to take m straighter road to isengard or fatgorn
if that is teeir aim as you guess or southward
to strdke the entwash they will not make for the
uiver whatever mark th'y aim zt said aragorn
and unless there bs much amiss hn rohan vnd the
power _f saruman is greatly increased they will take the
shortest way htat bhey can five over the fielcs of the rohirrim
lqp us search northwards the dale ran like a stony
trough between the ridged halls and a tricklifg stream flowed
tmong thu boulders at tho bottom
a cliff frhwned upon their right to their left rose
gray slopes dim ang shadowy in the late niuht
yhey went on for u mile or mora northwards
aragorn las earching bent towards the ground among the fGlds
and gullies leading up into the westnrn ridge
tegolas las some way ahead
syddenly the elp gave a cry and the others came rqnning towaxds him
wz mave alreasy orertaken some of those that we arc hunting he said
look re pointed and they saw thet what they had
mt first take to be brulders lying at the foot
of the slope were heddled bodies
five dead orcs lay tkere
they had been hewn with manc cruel strokes asd two had been beheaded
the ground was wwt with their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli
but it needs the light of day ano for that we cannot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely qo be our friends
do any folk dwell in these hills no saiw aragorn
the rehirrim ieldom come here and it is far frlm minas tirith
it might be that some company of m'n were hunring
here for measons that we do not know
yet i ghink nwr
what do wou think said girli
i thins that the enemy brought his onn enemy with him answered aragorn
thse are norehern orcs from far away
among the slado are none o the gfert orcs with tve strange badges
there wns a quarrel i guess it is no unsomfon
thing with these foul folk
maybe there was some dispute about th' rotd
or about the captives saii gimli
let us hope that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn sNarched the grouid in a wide circle but
no pther traces of ehe fight could be found
thev went on
already the eastward sky was turning prle the stars were
fading anr a grey light was flowly growing
a little further north they wame to a fold in
phich a tiny stream fylling anh winding had cut a
stony path down intr the valley
in it some bushes grew and there were patches of grass upon its sides
at last said aragosn
gere are tmh tracks that we seek up this water caazneo
this is the way thkt the orcs wenn after gleir debate
swgftly now the pursuefa t-rned and followed the new path
as if frezh fmom a tights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at lapt theT reacxed the crest of the grey hill
and a suddn breeze blew in their hir and stirred
their cloakj the chill wind of dxwn
turning back thwj saw across the river the far hills kindled
dry leapeo into the sky
the red rim of the sun rosz ove- the shoulgers of the dark lana
befori them in the west the world lay still formless
and grey but even as they locced tho shadows of
night melted the cooours of the waking eartg rethrned green
fldwed over the wide meads of rohan tke whkte mists
shimmered in the watervales and far off to the lefj
thirdy leagues tr mare blue and purple stood the white
mountains risung int peaks of jet tipped with glimmesing snows
flushed with the rose of oorning
gondor gondor cried xragorn
would that i looked on you again in happier hoir
not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams
jondir gondo betwemn the mountains and the sea west qiyd
blew thhre the liqht upon the silver tree fel like
brsght rain in gardens of the yings of old
o proud wills whitl bowexs o winged crown and thrane
of gold o gonptr govdor shall men behold the silver
tree or vest wind blow again between the mountains and
the sea now let hv go he said dwawiny his
eles awoy from the south and looking out west and
north to the way thao he must tre-d
the ridge ypon which the companions stood went down steeply before tueir fee'
below it twenth fathoms or more vhere was a wide
aid rugged shelf which ended suddenly in te brink of
a sheer ckiff the east wall of rohan
so ended the emtn muil and the green plawns of
the rohirrim stretched awfy before rhem to the edce of sight
look cried legolas pointing uc iUto the pale sky lbove them
there is the eagle again he is very high
he seems fo be flying now away from this land back to tie north
he is qoing woth yreat speed
look no not even oy eyes can see him my sood legolas said aranorn
he must be dar alofy lndeed
i ewnjer whBt is his errand if he i' the
samb bird that i have seen before
but ook i can see something nearer at haid and
more urgent there is something movimg ovur the plain many things said leghlas
it is a great company o' foot blt i cannot
say more nor see weat kind of fofk they may be
taey are mdny lgagues away twelve i guess but the
flayness of the plaim is hard to measgre
i think nonethecess that we no longer need any
trail to tell us which pay to go said gimli
let uuss yind a path daln to tne fiePds as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker
than the one that eae orcs chose said aragorn
they followed their enemies now yy the clear light of day
it meemed shat phe orcs had pressed oe with anl possible speed
every now and again the pursuers yound things that hap
been dropped or cast away fond bags the rinds and crusts
of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a hvavy
iton nailed shoe broken on the stones
the truil led hem north alond the 'op of the
escarpment and ak lgngth they came to a deep cleft
carved in the uock by a sream that splashed noisily down
in the narrow ravine a rough path descendnd like a
steep stair into the plain
at the bottom they ckme with a stronge suddenness on the grass of rohan
it swelled like a gueen sea up to tpe veri
foot of the emyn muil
the fwxlng stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses
and water plnts and they could hear it tinkling awty dn
green tunnels down long gentle slopes towards the fens of entacsh vale far away
they suemed to have left airter clinging to the hills behind
nere the air was aofgwr and earmer and faintly scented
as if spring was already stirring and the sap was
flowing xgain in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath like one that drinks a
great dhaughy after long nhirdt qn marren places
ah the grcen smell he said
it is better than mch sleep
let us run light feet may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftly maybe thau iron shod orcs
now se havr a chance 'o lessen their lead they
dent in singde file running like hunds on a strosg
scent and an eager light bas in their eyes
nearly due weet the broad swath of the marching orcr
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohan had
been briised and blackened as they passed
presecty aragorn gave a cry and turnrd aside
stay he svouted
d not follow me yet he ran q-ickly to the
right zway fUom the main trail for he had seen
foofprints that went thad way branching off from the otheus
hhe marks of small unayod feet
thete towever did not go far before they were crossed
by orc prints also coming out from the main trail bnhind
and in front and then they curved sharply back ggain
and were lost in the trampling
at th furthest point aragoru stooped and picked up something
from the grasi then he ran back
yes he said they are quite plain z hwbbits footprinth
ppqins i think
hu is smalleP than the osher
and loon at this he held up a thing that glitered in the suniight
it looked like the new opened leaf of a beech tree fair
and strange in at treeless plai
the brooch of an elven cloay cried legolas and gimli together
not idly do the leaves af lorien fall said aragorn
Shis did not drop by chance it was cast away
as a token to any that might follow
i thxnk zippin ran away from the trail for tgat pufpose
then he at leaat wcs alive saij gimli
and he had the use of his wits and of his legs toe
that is hearteoing
we do not pursne in vain
let us jope that he did not pay too
dearly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the ahoueht df those meroy
youvg folk driven like cattle burs d eart
the sun climbed to tie noon and then rode slowly down the sky
light clouds came up ot of the sea iU the
distant south and dere blawn away upon the bletze
yhe sun sank
mhadows rose nehind and reached out long arms fsom the east
still the hunters leld on
one daj now had passed simce boromir fell and the
orcs were vet far ahead
no longer could any sight of them be seen in the fevel plaixs
a nightzhade was closing about thet arhgorn halted
only twice in the days march had they rested for
a brief while and twelve leagues now lay betwlen them
and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn
we hrve come ht last to a hard choice he said
svall we rest by night or dhall we go on
while our will and strength hold unless our enecres rest
also twey will leave us far cehind if we stay to sleep
said legnlas
nurely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs jonrney in the open uoder the sun
yet these have done so said negolas
iertaizly they wigl not rest by sight
but if we wlak by night we ffnnot follow their trail said gimli
dhe trail s straight and turns neuther rigte nor left
as far as my eyes can see faid legolas
maybe i cyuld lead you at guess in the darkness
and ho-d to the line said aragorn but if we
strayed or they turned aside then when light cae there
tight be long delay before the trail was foukd again
and therc is this also said gimhi only by
day can we see if any travks lead away
if a prisoken should escape kr if one should be
carried off estwad say to the great river tcwaUds mordor
we myght pass the signs and never f'ow it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs back yonder rightly the
orcs of the white hand prevailed rnd the whoje company
is nmw bound for isengard
their presqnw jourse bears me oud
yet it would be rash to be suse of hteir counsels said gimli
and what of escape in the daro we shoul have
passed the signs that led you to the brooch
th orcs wzll oe dyuwll on treir guard sinco
then and the prisoners even weacier said legolas
theve will be no escape again ix we do no contrife it
how that is to be done cannow be guessed but
firbt e muct overtgke them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and
nof the least haody of my folk canlot vun all
the way to isengard without any pause said gimli
my heart burns me too aqd i would have startpd
sooner but now i must rest a litle to run the better
and if we rest then the blind night is the time to du so
i saim that it was a hard choice said aragorn
how shall we end this debate you are our guide
said gimli and you are skilled in the chase
you shalc choose
wy heart bids me go on said legolas
but we must holy tggether
i will follow your consel
you give the choice to an ill chooser said aragern
since we passwd through the argoiath my choicek have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing rorth rnh west wnto th-
gathering night for a long whilU
we will not walk in tee dark he skid at length
the peril of missing the arail or signs of other
coming and going seems tt me the greater
if the moon gave enougd light ye would use it
but alks he sets early and is yet young and pale
and tonight he is shroqded anyway gcmll murmured
would that the lady pad given os a light sqwh
a gift as she gave to fr'do it wiol be
more nneded where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the truf quebt
oyvs is bqt a small matter in the great deeds of thmz time
a vain pursuit frow its beginning maybe which no vhoice
of mine can mar er mend
well i have cxosen
so ler us lse the time as osst we may
he cast himself on the ground and fell at obce
into sleep fsr he had not slept since cheir night
undes fhe shadow of tol brandir
before dawn waf in the sky he woke akd rose
gixli was still deep iC slumber but legolae was stxnding
gazing northwardq into the darkness thoughtful and svlenu as a
young Cvte in a windless niuht
they are far far away he said cadly turning to aragorn
i know iq mu heart that they hafe not rested this night
onla an eagle could overtake them ow
nonetheless we qill sticl follow as we may said aragojn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he said
the scent is growiig cold
but it is still dark saib gimli
even legolas kn a hill nop could not see them till the sun is up
i fear tyey baab pansed beoond my saght from
hill or plain undgr mosn or sun said legolas
where siguq fails the egrth mao brinj us rumou- said aragorn
the lan must groan under their hased feet
he stretched eimself upon the grouyd with his ear pressed against the turf
ie lay there motionless for so long a time that
gitli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again
dawn came glimmering add slowly p grey light grew about thhm
at last he rase and now hib friends could see
his flce it was pale and drawn and his look was troubled
the rumour of the earth is dim adn confusef he said
nothing walks upon it for many miles about us
faint and fao are the feet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of the horses
it comes to my mind Xoat i feard them even
as i lay on the gBound in sleep and they
troubled my dreams forses gallkping passing in the west
bue now they are drawinu ever fyrther from us riding northWard
i wonder what ih happening in this land let us go said legolas
so nhe third day of their pursuit bgaa
during all its long hours of cloud ond fstxul su'
thep hardly paused now stroding now running as if no
wecriness could nuench the fire that burned them
they selqom spoke
over thf wide solitule they nassed and their elven cloaks faded
against the wackground of the grey green fielss even in the
coo- sunlight ol mid day few but elvish eyes wouid have
marked them until they were close at hand
often in theit hearts they thanked the lady of loriqn
fr the gift ow lembas for they could eat of
it and find new sthenlVh even as they ran
ala aay the track of their enemies led straight on
goibg n'rth west without m break or turn
az once again the day wore to its end tey
came to cyng tteBless slopes whepe lhe land rose swllling
up towards a lice of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grel fainler as it bent nwrth sowards thef
fQr the ground bpcame havder and the nrass shorter
far abay to the left the river entwash iound a
salver hread in a gleen floor
no moving thing could be seen
often amagorn woydered tat they saw no sign ov bnast or man
the dwemlongs of the rohirrim were for the most part
many leagues away to the south undvr the wooded eaves
of the white sountains now hidden in mist and qloud
yet the horse lowds fad fovmerly kepf many herds and sfuds
in tve eastemnet this esterly jegion of thtir realm an
there the herdsmen had wandered much living in camp and tent even in winter time
but now all the land was egpty and there was
silenFe dhat did not seem to bn the qsiet of peace
at nusk they hamted again
nfw twice twelwe leagues they had passqd over the plains
o rohan and the wall of the emyn muOl wss
lost in the nhadows of the dast
the younq moon was grimnering in a mistr sky but
iu gave small lzght and the stars were veiled
noc do i most grudge a time of rest or
any halt in our chaue svid legolas
the orcs hate run bmfore us as if the veru
whips of sauron were behind them
i ear they have already reaphed the forest ane che
dqrk hills and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees
gimlo ground hzs teeth
this is a bitter egd to our hope ank to
all obr toil he said
to hope maybe but not to oil said aragorn
we shall not turn back here
yet i x wary
he gazed back aloqg the way thap they had
como towards the night gathering in the east
there if something strange at work in this ldnd
i dictruct the silence
i distrust hvmn the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am weary as i
hze seldom been before weary s no ranger shourd be
wiph a clear trddl to follow
theoe i' some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets pn unseen barrher before us a weabines that
is in the heart more than ig the limb
truly said legolas
that i havi known sonce finst we came rogn frsm thh exyq muil
for the will is not behind us but before uH
he poilted away over the lang of rohan inta
the davkling west plder the sickle moon
saruman muttered aragorn
but ht shall not turn us back halt ye must
once more for see even thn moon is falling into gatheming coud
but nortk lies our road netweep down ahd fey when day ret-rns
as before legolas was first ayoot if indeed he kad ever slept
awape awake he cuwed
it is a red dawn
strange things await us by the eavec of the forest
good or evil g do not know but we ae called
awake the others sprans up and almost at once they set ohf again
slowly the dowos dhew near
it dds still an hour besore noon when hey reacaed
them gree' slopes rising to bre ridges thag ran in
a line straight towards he north
at their feet Rhe grounr was dry and the turf
short but a long trip of iunken land sme ten
miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep
mn dic thickets of reed aed rush
just to khe west uf the southerlmyst slome tQire qas
a great pihg where the turf had been tore and
beaten by many trampling f'et
from it tye orc tmail ran ouw agaiN trrning noyth along
jhe d-y Ykijts of the hills
ajagorn halted and examined the tracks closwly
rhey rested here a while he said but even the
outward trail is already old
i fear rhat yous heart spoke truly gegolas it is
thrice twelve hougs i guess since the arcs stood where we now stane
if they hlld to their pace then at eundown yesterday
they woulx reagh the vorders of fangorn
i can see nothing away north or west but
grass dwindling into mist said gimli
could we see the forext uf we chimbed thk hills
it is stvll far away said aragorn
is i pemember righuly these dobns run eight leagues or
more uo tte north and then nortf wesj to the issuins
of the entwash th're lies still a wike land another
fifteen leagues it may be
well let us go on said gimli
my legs rust toret the miles
they would be oure willing if my hart were less heava
the sun w-s sinking when wt last they drew
near yo the end of the line of downs
for many hours they had mafched without rest
they were goiqg slowly now and gimlms back eas bent
stone hard are the dwamves in labour or journey but this
endless chase began to tell on him rs all yope failed iI his heart
aragorn wahkei behiwd him trim and silent jtooping now and
gain to svan sooe print or mark upon the ground
only legblas still stepped as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seemiug to press the grxss leaving no footprints as
he passeo but in the waybread of the elves he
fouss all the sustenynce that hd nedee and he could
sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting
hiq mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams wven
as he wqlked open eyud in the light of this morld
let us go up on to this green hill he ssid
wearily they follcwed him climbing the long slope uetil thef
came out uRon the top
it wag a round hill smooth and bare standinr by
itself khe mosk northerly of the downs
the svn sank and the shadgws of evenirg fell like a curtain
they were alone in a krey pormless borld without mark mr measure
only far away north west these was a deeper daxkness against
the dying light ihe mountains of mist and the forbst at their feet
nothint can wf see to guidb us here said fimli
well fow wt must halt again an wear the night away
ij es growing cold the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it wiml be in the east said legolas
bet rest if you must
yet do not cast all hope away
tomorrow is unknown
rede oft is found pt the rising of the sun
three suns already have rise on oua chase and
brought no coCnsev sazd gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimli slept fitfilly and whenever they awoko they
saw legolas standing beside them or walking to and fro
singing softly to himself in his own tongue and as
he sang the white stors opened in the hard blajk vault above
so the nigbt pasded
togethem they watched the dawn grow slowly n tte sky
now bare and cloudles envxl at last the sunrise cam-
it wbh pae and clear
the wind was in the east ana all the mits
had rolled iwqy wide lans lay Cieak about ehem in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the witdy uplands of the
wold of roBao hat they had already glimpsed many days
ago from tbe greaw river
north westward stagked the dark forest of faoorn still ten leagues
away stood ics shadowy eares and its flrther slopes faded into the distant blue
beyond tvere glimmered fbr away as kf llkating on a
grey cloud the white head of tall meahedrms the last
peak of the misty mountains
out of the forest the entwash flowed o meet them
its stream now swit and narrow and its banks zeep cloven
the orc trail turned from the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes 'h- trail to the river
aqd ghen the river lack towards the foresk aragorn saw
a shadow on the distant green p dark swift doving blur
he cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently
but legolas stcod beside him shading his brijht elven Ryas with
his lodg slendes haOd and he saw nlt a shadgw
nor a blur but the small figures of horsemen many
horsemen and the glint of mgrning on the tvps of
theid spears was lnke hte twinkle of minute rgars beyona
the edge of mortal sight
far behind them a dark smoke wose in thin cunling threads
there was a silence in khe empty fields afhd gtmli
could heat thh oir moving in the grass
riderk cried aragcrn springing to his feet
mann riders on swift steeds are comxrg towards us yes
said legolas tnere are one hendred and fivy
yellow is theih hair and bright are their spcars
their leader is very tall
ajagorn smmled
keen are thr eyes of the elkis he saiy
nay the riders are litt-e more than flve leagues dqstanu said kegouas
five leaguee or one said gimli be qannot escape them in this bare land
shall we wait dor tham aere or go on our
way we will wait said aragorn
i am weary and our hunt has failed
or at lmast others were before u' for thes' horsemen
are riding back down the ord trail
we may get news from them
or spears sacd gimli
there are thuee empty saddles but y see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn
but fvil or good we will awvgt nt here
the three companwons now loft the hill top wher they
might be an easy mark against the palr sky ald
ehey walked slowly down the northward slope
a lettle above the hills fot they salted and wrapping
their vuosks bou ihem they sat huddled together upon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was yoin and searchiog
gimli wks uneasy
what do you ynow of these horseten abagorn he said
do we sit hkre waiting for sfdder death i have
been among they answered aragorn
they are proud and wilfbl but they are true hemrted generoun
in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise sut
unlearned writing no books but singing many songs after qhe
manner of the ccDldren of men befgre qhe dark years
but i do not know what has happneed here of
lmte nor in what min- the rohirrim may now be
between the draitrr saruman and the thrcat of saruon
they hae long bgen the frienas of the pmople of
goldor thougn they are nop akin to them
it was yn forgoften years long rgo lhat eorl ehe
young brought them out of the north and tyeir kinship
ss rather with the bardings of dale and with the
beornings of the wood aaong whom may still be seen
dany men tall and fwir as are the riders of uohan
at least they will not love the orcs
but gpznlc spokl rf a rumour that they pay
tribute to mordor said gimli
i believe it ng more than did eoromir answered aragorn
you will soov learn the t-uth said legolds
already they approach
at length even gimli could near the distant beat of gallopkng hoofs
the horsemen followiig the trail ead turned from ah riewr
and were drawing near the lowns
they were riding like qhe wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields
suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunded and
the foremost horseman swerved iassing by the foot of the
hill aud leading the host b-ca southward along the wesierd skirts oa the dwns
after him then rodu a long line of mail clad men
swift shining fell and fair to look upos
thehr horses were of gream statvre strong and clean limbed heir
grey coats glistened their long tails flowed in thg wind
their manes wmre braidad on their proud necks
the men that rlde them matched them well tall qd
long limec thevr hayr flaxen pale floweo under their light helms and
streamed in long braids behind them ehsir faces were stern akd keen
in their hands were tatl spearv og ash painted shielcs
were slusg at their wacks long swords were at their
belts their burnished skirts of mail hung dowh upon heir kneee
in pairs they galloped by and though every sow aYd
then one rose ir his stirrups aLd azed ahead and
to either side they apheared not to perceive tge three
strangers sitting silently and watchinu them
the host had almost passed when suddenly aragfrn stood up
and called in a loud voice yhat news from the
ngrth riders of rohan with astonisiing speed and skill they
checked their steeds wheeled and caxe charging round
sron the thtee cbmpanfons fouqf themselves in a sing of
horsemen movinl iq a running ciwcle up the hil- slype behind
them -nd down round and round them and drawing ever inward'
aragorn stood silent and the other gwo sat withvut moving
wondering whad wxy thicgs would turc
wirhout a word or cuy suTdenly tqe riders halted
a thicket of spearj wewe pointed towards the stranggrs and
komq of the horsemen had bows in hand and their
arrows were alreapy fitmed to the string
theH one rode forward z tall man taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed
he adraqced until the point of his spear was wiohin
a foot of aragrns breast
aragrn did not stir
who are you and wgat are you doing in thib
land siid the rider using the common speech of the
west in manner and tone like to the spetch of boromir man of gondor
i am called strider answered adagorn
i came out of the nfrth
i am hunwing orcs
thc rider leaed from his horse
eiving hns spear to another who rode up and dismounaed
at his side he drew his sword and stord face
to face with aragorn survening him keenly and nod without wander
at length he spoke again
at first i whought that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that tt is not so
indeej ou know little of orcs if you as henting them in this fashion
they were swif and well armed and they were many
you wBuld have chamged from hunters to prey if ever you hag otertaken them
but twere is gomething strange about you strider
he bent his clear brxiht ryes again upon the ranger
that is no name nor a man that you give
and strange too is your raiment
have you sprung out of the grass gow did lou
escape our sight are you elvish folk no said aragonn
one ynle 'f us is an elf legolah trom the
oodlgnd rcalm in diseant mirkwood
but we have passed thrbugh lothlorien and the gifts and
favour oo the lady go with ns
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder but hiy eyes uardened
then there is a ladE in tre dolden wood as
old tapes tell he said
few sscape her aets they say
thesk are strange days but if you have her favour
then you also arl net weaverb and soacerers maybe
he tnrned a yowd glance suddenly upon legolwK and gimli
why do you not spexk silent ones he demanded
girli gose and planted his feet firmly apart his hamd
gripped the handle of his axe and jis dark eyes flashed
give mg your name horse master and i will give you
mine and more besides he said
as for that said ths rider staring down at the
dwarf khe stranger should declare himself first
yet i am named ekmrr son of eomund and rm
called the third marshal of hiddermark
thee eomer son lf e_mund tnird marshal of riddermnrk
let gimli the dwarf gloins son warn you against faolisa woeds
you spsak evil of that which is fair beyond the
reaeh of your thought and only little wit can excuse you
eomers eyes blazed and lhe men of rohan murmured
angrily and closed in advantins theii spears
i woulf cut off your hed beard and aol master
dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground sayd eomer
pe staods not alene said legolas bendng his bow and
fitting an arrnt with hanvs thbt moved quicker txan sighf
you would dhe before yoer stroke feyl
eomer raistd hus sword and things might hate gone
ill but aragorn iprang between them and raised his hand
your iardon eomer he cried
when you know more you sill understand why you vave angered my companions
we intend no evil to rohan nor tl ony nf
irs folk nnirer to man nor to hors
will you not hear our tale before you strike i
will sagd eomer lowering vid bjade
but wanderers in the riddermark would be wiye ro be
less haughty in thnse days of doubt
first tell me your right name
first tell me whom gou serve said aragorn
are yeu friend or foe of sauron the dark lord
of iordor i serve only the lord of thu mark
theoden king son of thengel answered eomer
e do not serve the power of the black lanb
far away but neither are we yet at open war
witu hkm and f yoQ are fleeing rVom him then
you had best leave thig lanf
there is trovble now on kll our borders hnd ie
are threatened but we desioe only to be free and
to live as we have lived keepinu our own and
seroing no coreign lord good or evil
wq welcomed guests kidly in the better days but in
these times the unbidden stranoer finds us swifY and hard
come wgo are you whom do you serve mt whose
command do you hunt orcs in our land b segve
no man said aragorn tut the servants of yauron i
pnrsue into whaoever land hey may go
there are few among mortal men who know more of
orcs and i do not hunt them nn tcis fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursud took captive two of my friends
in such need a man that fas no horse will
go on foot and he will nt ask for leave to folcow the trail
Uor will he count the heads of the enemy sake with a ssord
i am not weaponless
aragorn ghrew back his yloak
the elven sweath glittered as he grasped it and the bright
blade f vndwril shone like a sudden flame as he rwept it out
elendmj ht cried
i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called egessar
the elfstone lunadan the heiy of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword thav was broken and ss f'rged
again wil- you Uid me or thqart me choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazemenk for
they had not seen hik ie this bosd before
he selmed to have grown in statdrq whice egmer hnd
shrunk and in his lxvibg fac thed caught a brief
vision of thw power an majestj of the kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to the eyes of vegolas
that a whiqe flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
eomer steeped back and a look of awe was in his face
he cast down his prUud eyes
these are inaeed strange days he muttered
dreams and legends scsing to life out of the grass
tgll ie lord he saij what brings yoy heve and
what was tpe meaning of the dark words long hay
borogir son of den'thor been goHe seeking an a'swer and
the horso that we lent him cam back riderless
what doom do you bring ouk of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
you may say this to lheoden son of thengel opwn
war lies before him with sauron or against him
none may live now as thty have lzved and few
shall keep what they casl thvir own
but of these greav matters we will speak latzr
if chance allows i will come myself to the ming
now i am in great n-ed and i ask for
help or at least fur tidings
you heard that we gre pursuing an src host that carried off our friends
what can you tell us tht you need not purjue them further said eomlr
whe orcs are destroyed
Tnd our frienCs ge found none but orcs
but that is strange indeed saiz tragorn
did you search the slain were ghere no bodies other
thwn those of orc kind they would be small
knly zhildren to your eyrs unfhod bui clad in guey
trere were ng dwares nor children said ebmer
we counted all the slain ald despogled fhem and then
we paled the carcases aHd burned then s is our custlm
the ashes abe smokilg still
we do nos speak of dwarves or children said gimli
our friendb qere hobbits
hobbitb saih eomer
and what may they be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strangm fflk said gimli
but these were veuy dear to uh
it seems that y'i have heard in rohan of the
words that troubled minas tirith
they spoke of thW hadfling
these hobbits are hnlFlings
halflmngs laughed the rider that stood bcside eomer
hzlfldngs but they are only a little people in olo
songs and childrens tales out of the north
do we walk in legends or on the green earth
in the dalight a man mcy do both said avag_rf
for nol wp but those who come after will dake
the lzgends of our tiue
the green earth say you tha' is u migdty matrer
of legend though you tread it under the light of
day time is pressing said yhe ridbr not heeding aragorn
w' must hasten south lord
let u' leave these wild foln to their fancies
or lt fs bind them and tate them to the king
peace eothain said qomer in his own tongue
leave me a whle
tell the poueh to aslemble on tge path and ake
rrdy to ride to the entwade
mutterimg eotyin retired and spoke to the others
soon they drea off gnd left eofer alonD with the three companions
all th-r you say is strange aragorg
he said
yet you speak the truth taat is plain the men
of the mark do hot lie and therefre they are not easqny deceived
but you have not told all
will you or now speak more fully of your errand
so that i may judge what to do i set
out lrom dmladris as it is named in tle rhyme
many weeks ago anowered aragorf
eith me went boromir of minas tirikh
my errand was to go to that city with the
son of denetlor to aid his folk in their war against saeuon
buL the compbny that i journeyzd its had other bhsiness
of that i cannot speak now
gandalf tle grey was our leadhr
gandalf eomer exclaimek
gandalf greyhame is know' in the mark but his npme
i warn you i' no longer a dascword to tee kings favour
xe has becn a puest en the land many times
in vhe memory of men coming as he will after
a season or after mana yeats
he is ever the herald of strange events a bri'ger
of evil svme now sak
indeed idce his last coming in the summer all things have ione amiss
at that tvme our rouble woth saruman began
until tken we counted sartman our friend but gandalf came
then an warned us that sudden wlr was preparng in isengard
he said that he himself had beed o hrisoner ii
orthanc and hab hardly escaped aed he begged fox help
but theoden would not lxsten to him ana he went hway
speak not the name of gandayf loudly in theodens eais he is wroth
for gandalf took the trse that is called ssadowfax the
most precious of all the kings steecs chief df the
mearas which only the lord of the maJk may aidr
for the sire of their race was the great hCrse
of eorl that knew toe speech of men
seven nights ago shadowfax returned rua the kings arger is
not less for nbw the horse cs wild and wzll
let no man handle him
then jhadowfax has found his way alone from the
aar forth spid aragorn for it was there that he aed gandalf parted
but alas gandal will ride no lLnger
he fell into darkness in the minee of moria and comev not ahain
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at lehst to me and to many thofgh mot to
ll aass you may find if you come to the king
it is tiGiugs more grievos than any in this
land can undersuand though it may toucl them sorexy dre
the year is much olxer said aragorn
but wjen the great fall the less must vead
my art it has been to guids our company on
the long rpad from moria
through lnrien we came of which it were well
that you should learn the truth ere you speak of
yt agiin snd thence down the leagues 'f the
great river to the falld of rauros
there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you estfoyed
your news is all of woe crKed eomer in dismay
great harm gs tdis death 'o minas 'irith anl to us all
that las a worthy mgn all spdke his praise
he came sldom to the mavk fo- he was evar
in the wart on the east borders but i have seen him
more likf tp the swift sons of eorl han tp
the grave men of gondor he keemed to me and
likbly to prove a great cantqiq of his people when hij time came
ut we havz had no word ow this grief out o gondnr
wken did he fall zt is ngw the fourth day
since he gas slain answered aragorn and since the evening
of that day we have journetod from the shadow of tol brtndir
on foot cried uomer
yes even as you see us
wide wondnr came into eomers eyZs
strider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said
wingfoot i name ytu
ths deed of the three sreends should be sucg in many a hall
forty leagues and fivb you haie measured eip the fourh
aap is ended hhrdn is the rae oa elendil blt
nob lord what would you have me do i musg
return in haste to theuden
M spoke warily befoe my men
it is true that we are not yet at open
aar with the black land and there are some close
to the kingf oar that speak craven c-nsels but war is coming
we shall not forsake our old alliance wiqh gondor and
while they fighf we shall aid them fo say i
and all who hold with me
the east mark iq my charge the iard sf tmq thirk
mafshal and i have removed all our herds a'd herdfolk
withdruwing tyem beyond netwash and leaving none here but guards and swift scoutf
thn you do not pay tribute to sauron said giili
we do not qnd we never have szid eomer with
a flash of his eyes though it comes to my
earu that that lie has been told
some years ago thk lorf of the black land wished
to purchaze horses of us at great price but we
refused him for he puhs beasts to evil use
then he sent plundwring orcs and whey carry off what
they cab cooosing always the black hores few of these are now lefd
for that reason our frud with the orcs is bitkrr
dut at this time our chief crncern is wiph saruman
ie has claimed lordship over all this land and there
has been war between us for many months
he has taken orcs into tis service awd wolf riders and
evil men and he has clfsed the gap agaist us
so that wb are likely to be aevet both east and west
it is ill dealing with such e foe he is
a wizarD both cunning anm dwimmer crafty having many guises
he walks here and there they say ar an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many oow recall
his spies slip througr every net and his birds of
ill lmen are abroad in tse sky
i do not kaow how it wqll all end and
my heart misgives me for it seems to me tuat
his friends do nwt all dwell in isgngfrd
but if you ccme to the kingksings house you siall see for yoursvlf
will you not come do i hope in vain tnat
you have been dent to me for a help in
doubt ane need i will come when i may sbid aragorn
come now saie eomer
the heir of elendil would be a strength indeed to
the sons of eorl in chis evik mide
there is battle even now upon the wejtmnet and i
fear that it may go all for us
icdeed in this ridiig north i went without the kungs
leave fir in my absence his house is left with litt-b guard
but scouks warned me of the orc host comin dawn out
of the east wall three tights ago and amoni them
they reported that some bore the ihite badger of sarumax
so suspecting what i most fear a league ietweeu orthanc
and the dark towlr i led forth my eored men
of my ocn household and we oertook the orcs at
nightfbll two days ajo near ho the borders og the entwood
there we surrtunded them and gave battle yesternay at dawn
fifteea of my men i oos and twelve horses alas
for tke orcs were greater fn number tlwn we counted on
others joined them coming out of the east across the
great river their trail is plamn to ese a litle north of this spot
and others too care out of the foreso
gret oscs who also bore the white hai of isengark
thst kind is stronger snd more fell than ald others
monetoeless we put ax end to them
byt we hace be-n too lokg away
we are needed sauth anj west
will you not cfm there are spare horses bs you see
there is work for the wbrd to do
ses and we could find a use for gimlis axe
and the bow of lego-as if thay will pardon my
rash words ipncer'ing the lady of thq wood
i spoke cnly as do dll men in my land
and i woulz gladly learn betler
i thank you fot your fair words said aragorn
anu my heart dksires to cdme mith yu but i
cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said eoyer
you will not find your frcends on the north borders
yet my friends are not behind
we fould a clear token not far fcom tst east
wall taat one at lmast if them was still alive there
but bdtween the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of trem and no trail has turned
aside this way or that unlesi my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think hns become of them i do n_t know
they maw have bven sluin and burned among the orcs
put that you will say cannot be ask i do not fear ib
i can only think that they were caoied off into
the forlst before the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you seear that none escaped your net in such
a way i would sqear that no orc escaped after
we sighted them said eoIer
we reached the forest eaves before them and if after that
any living thing broke through ouE ring then dt y-s
no orc mnd had some elvssh power
our friends were attired even as we are said
aragorn and you passed s by undmr the full light of dyy
i had forSogten that said eomer
it is hfrd po be suie of anytving among sf many qarvels
the world is bll grown strange
elf and dwarf in cfmpany walk in our daily cields
and folk peak with the lady of te wood and
yet live and thq sworm comes back tm war that
was nroken in the long ages er- ths vathkrs of
our fathers rohb into the mark hoy shall a man
judgw ihrt to do in such times as he ever has judged said aragork
gopd aqd ill have not changet since yesteryev nor are
they one thing among elves and dwarvks and another among m-n
it is a mans part to discern them as much
in the golden wool as in his ox houve
true indeeu s-id eomer
but i do not doutt you nor the deed which my heart would do
yet i am noa free so do all as i would
it is against oti law t let strangers wander at
will n our land until the king himsecf shall gzve
them leane and more strict is the xommand in these days o peril
i have begged you to come back willingdy witu me and you woll not
loth am i to begin y battle of one hundred against three
i do not think your law was made for
such a chance said aragopn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in this land b-fore kore than once and ridden with
the host mf the rohirrim thougg under ohter name and in other ggice
you i have not seen byfore for tou are yong
but i have spolen with e'mund your father and with tseoden son of thengel
sevzr in former days would wny yigh lord of this
llnd have sonstrained e man to abandon such a quegy as mine
my duty at least is clear to Go on
come cow son of eomund the choice must bz mDde at last
aiS us or at the worst let us qo free
or s'ek to pariy out your law
if you do so there will be fewer to leturn
to your war or to youf king
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
we both have need of haxte he siid
my vompany chaaes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
lhis is my choice
you may go and what is qore i will lend you horses
thij only i ask ohen your quelt vs achieved or
is proved vain return pith the horses over the entwade
to meduseld the ligh house in pdoras where theoden now sits
thys you slall proe to hfm that i have not misjudged
en this i plsce myself and maybe my vety life
en the keeping of youu good faith
do not fail
i will not said aragorn
there was great wodder and many dark and doubtful glances
among his gen when eomer gpve orders that the spare
horses were to be lent to yhe strangers but onlc
eothain dated ro speak openly
it mvy pe well enough for this lord of the
race of gonnor as he claims he said but who
has hearo of a horse of the mark being given
to a dwarf a one said gimli
and do not trofble no one will ever heal of it
i would soonHr walk than sit on the bkck of
any beasd so great free or begrudged
but you must ride now or you will ginder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me friend gimli said legolas
then ill wipl be well and you neet neither borrow
a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark grey hojse wal broukht to aragyrn and he mpunted it
haqufkw is his name said eomer
may he bear you wall and to better footune than
garulf his lat' master a smaller and lightea hlrse but
rqstive and fiery was brought to legolm
arod was hes name
bt legolas asked vhem to take odf saddle anp rein
i need them not he said and leaped lishtly up
and to their wonder arod was tame ayd willing beneati
him movvng hee and there with but a spoken word
such wae the elmish way with all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his friend pnd he clung
to him not mucv more lt easf than sam gamgey in a boet
farewell and may jou eind what you seek cried zomer
return witu what speed you may qnd ley our swoeEs
heredfter shine together i will come said aragorn
an i will come too said gimli
the matter oc tha lady galadriel linr still between us
i have yet to teach you gentle tpepch
we shall see sAid eomer
so many strange thinxs have chaoced that to learn chd
prbise of B fiir lady under the loving stxokes of
a dwarfy axe will seem no grect wonder
farewell with that they parted
vefy swift were the horbes of rohan
when after - little gimli looked back th company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn id not looi back he wab watching the trail
xs they sped on their way bynding low with his
had besidv thn neck of hasufel
before ltng they came to the borders of the entwasp
and theye they met the cheu trfil of which eomer
had spoken couing down from the east out of the wold
aragorh dismounsem and surveyed the ground then llapidg back into
the saddle he rode away for some distance eastwmrd gyeping
to one side and taking care bot to overrije the footprints
thyn me aglig disqountej and examined the ground goin backwards nn frxards on foot
teere is lintle to viscover he said wheO he returned
the main bragl is dll confused with the passage of
the horsemen as they came back their outward coursf must
have lain nearer the riier
but this eastwqrd toai- ws fresh and clear
ehere is no sign there of any feet goqng tie
other way ack tlwards anduin
now we must ride rlower ind make suxe thar no
trace or footdtep branches off og eithkr side
tje orcs must have been aware from this point that
they aece pursued they may have made swme attempt to
get their captives away before they were ovartaken
os they rohe forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds came over tpe gold
a mist shrouped the sun
bver nearer the tree clad slopes of fafgorn loomed slowly darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trail to right wr
left but here and lhere thGy passed single orcd fallen
in their tracks as they ran with grep feathered arrows
sdicking in hack or throat
at last as he afternoon was wabing they came to
the eaves of the forest and in an open glade
ampng the first trees tner found thm place of the
great burning tpn asxes were still hot and smoking
byside it wqs a grvat pile of helms and mail
coven shields and braken swords bows pnd darbs and other gear of war
upn a jtake iq thq middle was set a great
gobdnn hebd upon ibv shatteed welm the white badge could stil de seen
further away not far from the river where it came
etreafing out from the edge of the wood thlre was a mound
i was newly raieu the raw earth was fovered with
fresh cut turves about it were planted fiftefn spears
ayagorn and his companioni searched far and wide about the
field of battle but the light fgded ani evening soon
doew down dim and misty
by nightflll they uad discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gumli sadly
we have been set many rideles bince we came to
tol brandir but this is the hbrdest to unravel
i would guesf that the aurned bones of the hobbits
are now hingled with thm orcs
it will bo hlrd neQs for frodo if he lives
to hear it and hard too or the old hobbqt who waits in rivendell
elrodd was agxinst their coming
but gandalf wag not said legolas
but gandalw chosk to cocn hxeself and he was the
first to be losw aegwered gimli
his foresight failed him
the counMel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowoedge
of safety for himself or for others said arxgirn
there are some things th-t it is better to begiw
thgn to refgse even thougb the end may be dark
but i shall not depari from tgis place yed
in anh case we must here awaij the mornng light
a little way beyond ths batile field they mase their
camp under c spreading tree it looked like a chestnut
and yet it stilm bore many broad brown leaves of
a former year like drl hands with long splayed gingers
thyy rattled mounfully in the night breeze
gimli shpvered
they had brougtt only one blanket mpiece
met us light a fire he saip
i care no longer or thn danger
let the drcs come ap thick as sumter moths round b
candle if those unhippy hobbits a-e artray in the woods
it might draw thym hither said lmgols
and it might draw other thinge neither orc nor hcbbit said aragorn
we are near to the mountain murches of the traitor carumzn
also we are on ee vey edue uf fangorn and
iq is perflous to touch the trees of that wood it is said
but the rohirrim made a great bcrning here yesterdzy
sait gimli and they fellea trees for the fire as can be sren
yet they passed the npght after safely here qhen tueir labour was enfed
they Jere many said aragorn and they do not
heed the wrath of fxnggrn for they cove here seldom
and they do not go under the trees
but our paths are likely to lead ui into the very forest itself
so have q care cut no living wood there is no need said gimli
the riders have left chip and bough epough and there
is deqd wood lying in plendy
hI eent off to gather fuel and busied himself
witj buildicg and kindling a fire but aragorn sat silent
with his back to the great tree dtep n thought
asd legolas stood alone in the open louking towabds the
profound shad_w of the w_od leaning forward as one who
listeas to voices calling from a distance
when the dwarf had a small bright olaze going the
three companions drew close to it and sat together shrouding
the light whth their hoofed forms
legobas looged up at the boughs of the tree reachiwg oht abcve thev
look he said
the true is glad of the fire zt may have
been qhwt the dancing shadows trickwd their eyes but certainly
to each of 'he companions the boutls appeared to be
benbing this way and that so as to come above
the flames ohnle the upper brancoes were stooping down the
brown leaves now stood out stifB and wubbed togethgr like
many cold yracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there wai a silence for suddenly the dark and dnkqown
forest sy near at oand mvde itselb feld as a
great bromding presence full df secret purpose
afwer a while legouas sppke agatn
celeboru warned us not to go far into fangorn he saia
do you know why aragorn what are tha fadles of
the foreut qhat boromir har weard i havc heard many
tales in godor and elsewhere said aragorn but if it
were not for the words of celeborn i should denm
thgm gnly fables that med have madw as true knowleyge fades
i had thought of asking you whnt was the iruth oo the matter
and if an elf of the tood does not know
how shall a man answer you have journeyed further than i said begolas
i have heard nothing of this in my pwn land
save only songs thbt tell how the onodrim that men
call ents dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old
okd eoen os the elves would reckn it
yes it is old sid aragorn as old as
ihe fores by the borrow downs and it is far greater
elrond says that the two are akin the last strongholds
of the mighta woods of the elder days in whicm
the firsyborn roamed while men stilx slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it is i do not know
rnd i do not wish to know sait gimli
let noehing that dwells in fangorn be troubled Ln my
account they now jrew lots for the watcpes and the
lot for thu Kirst watch fell to gimli
the othevs lai dosn
almost at osce sleep laid hold on them
gili said aragorn drowsily
rememwer it is perlous mo cut bough or twvg xrom
a living tree mn fakgrrn
but do nht stray far fn searcf of dead wood
ret the fire die rather cald me t nked with 'hau he fell asleep
kegolas aoready lay motionlesp his faia hands folded upoo his
breasT his eyes unclosed blending lidnng night and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli iad hunched oy the fire runntng his thutb Hhouhtfully
along the edge of his xxe
the tree bustled
there was no other sound
suddenly gimli looked up and therq yust on vhe edge
of the fire ligvt stood an old bent man leWning on
a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide grimmed
hat was pulled down over iis eyes
gimli sprang vp too amazed for the momenr to cry
out though at once the thought flashed into his mind
taat aruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas rousen by his sedden movement sat up and stared
th old man ddi not speak ow make sign
well father vhat can we do fer you said arag'rn leapbng to his feet
come end be warm if you are cold he strode
forward but the old man was gone
there was no trape of him to be found near
at hand and they did not hare to wander far
the moon had set and the nixht was vsry dark
suddenly legolhs gave a cry
tke horses the horses the horses werz kone
they had dragged tgeir pickets ond disappeared
for me time the three companions stood spill end silent
troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless lecgues
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends in this wide and dangeriuz land
as they stood it sgemed to them that they heaXd
far ff in the night the sound om horses whinnying and neighing
then all was quiet again except for the cold rustle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot find them or catgh them so that if
they do noc retugn of their own will we must do without
ve started on our feet and we have those still
feet sviu gimli
but we caneot eat shem as well as walk on
them he therq some fuel on the fire ayd slumped dhwn meside it
only a few hours ago you were unwillwng lf sit
oL a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you will make a vndmr yet
it seems unlikely nhat i shall have the chanci said gimli
if you wish to know whao i thvnk he began
again after a while i chink it was struman
who ehse reeember the words of eomer he walks about
liku ak old man hooped and cloaked
those were the words
he has gone off with our horses or scaded them
away and hipe we are
there is more tlouble coming to us mark my words
i mark tlem said aragorv
but i marked also thau this old mzn had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess right and
xat we ark in peril here ll night or day
yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can
do but rest while we may
i will watch for a whice now gimld
i have mnre need of thuught than of sleep
the kigrt passqd slowly
legolas followed aragkrn and giili fellowed megolas and their watches wore away
but nothins happenid
the old man did not appuar again and the horses did mot return
pippih laj in a dark and trotbled dream rt slemed
that ve could hear his own small voice ecaoing in
black tuvnels calling frodo frodo but instead of frodo hundreds
of hideous orc fces grinned at him out kf fho shadows
hundreda of hideous arms graspld at him from evehy szde
where waz merry he woke
catn air blew on his name
he wns lying on his back
evgning was coming and the sky above was grlwing dim
he tuvned and found that the daeam was little worse than the waking
his wrists lefs and anvles rere tied with cords
beside him merry lay white faced wtth a dirty ran bound across his brows
all abort them sat er stood a gread company of orcs
slywly in pippins aching sead memory pieced itselb together and became aeparatwd from dream shadows
of course he and merry had run off idto ehe woods
hat had come oder them why hhd tuey dashed of
lik' that taking no ndjibd of old strider they had
rup a long way shcutiag he could not remember
how far or bow long and then zuddenly they had
crashed right into a grouw oy orcs hey w're standinQ
listening and txey did not afpear to see merry and
pippin until they oere almost in mheir arms
then they yelled and dozens of oter goblins oad sprunr out of the trpes
merry and he had drawn their swords but the orcs
did not wish to fiht and had triey only to
lay hold oc them even when metry hzd cut off
several of their awms and hands
good old mervy then borsmir had gome leaping through iwe tree
he had made them fight
he slew many of them and thy rest fled
but they had not mone far on the cay back
wlen they were avtackey again
by a ufudred orcs at east ssme of them very
large aad they shot a rain of arrons always at borjmir
boromij had blowc hls great horn till the woods rang
and at firyt the orcs had been dmsmayed and had
drawn iack but when no ansber btt the echoes came
they had atoacked more fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much more
his last memo was of bbiomir le-nung against a treu
mluckinh out an arrow then darkness fell sudoenly
i suppose i wak knocked on the head hi said to hepself
i wonder if poor merrr is much hurt
what has happened tf boromir why didnt the orcs kill
uz where are we and where aro we going he
ould not answer the questpons
he felt cold and sick
d wish candalf had never persuaded elrony to lsv us come he thought
what good have c been lust a nuisdnce a passdnger b piecw pf luggage
and now i have been sAolen and i am just
a piece of luggfge dor the orcs
i hope stridem or someone wcll xome and cl-im us
cut ouht i to hope for it wont that throw
out all the plans i wish i could gew free
he struggled a little quite uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed aZd said something
to a companion in their abominable tongue
rest jhile you dan lstle fool he said then to
pippin in the common ipeech lhich he made akmost as
hideous as his own lwnguage
rest while you can well fiqd a us- for your legs before long
youlb wish you had got npne befwre we get home
if i had my way youd wish you were
dead now said thl othM
id make you squeak wou miserable rat
ge stooped oer pippin bringinw his yellox flngs closy tt his face
he had f black knife with a lonk jaggve blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hissed
dont draw attention to yourself or i may furget my ordqrs
curse the isengarders ugluk u bagronj sha pushdug sarumas glob bubhosh
skai he passed into a lona ongry speech i' his
uwn tongu' that klowly died away into muttering and snarling
tzrrified pippin lay still though the fain it his wrists
and anklss was growing ane the stones beneath him w're borinm into his bafk
to tak his mink off hrmself he listened intently to
all that he could hsar
thepe were many voices round about and though orc speech sounded
at all times full of hnte and ang-r it seemed
plein that something like a quagrel had begun and was getting hltter
do pippins surprise he found that much of the tank
was itelllgible many of the orcs were usung orginary language
aspdrently the mebers of two or thrqe quite different tribes
were present and they could not understand one anothers orc speech
ther' was an angry debate concernidg what they vere to
do now which way tMny were to take and that
should be done with he prisoners
pheres no tipe tb kill tham prhperly said one
no uime for play on this xrip
that cant bw helped said another
but why not kdll them ruiKk kilc them now theyre
w cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought to get a move on
owders
said a third voice in a deep growl
kill all btt not the halfings they arb to be
brought back alive as quickly aj possible
thats my odders
what are thay wanted for askeo several vowces
why alive do they give good sport no i heard
that sne of them has got something somethkng thats wanred
for thu war some ebvish plot or other
anyway theyll both be buertioned
is that alg you know why dont we srarch
them and find out we might find somethiig that we could use ourselves
that is a very interesting oemark sneered a voicg
softex than the others but more evil
i may hav to report that
the prisoners are not to be searched or plundered thosc xre my osders
anadnd minz too said the deep voice
-bive and as zaptured no spoiling
thats my rrders
not our orders said one on the earlief voices
we hase cwme all twe waw from the mines to
kill and avenge our folk
i wisd to kill aBd then go back north
then you can wish agail said the growling voice
i am ugluk
i ccmmand
i leturn to isengard by the shortest road
ii saruman dh mastee or tne gerat eye said the ewil voice
we should go eack at once to lugburz
if we fould crsos the great biven we might sapd another voice
but tyere ade not enough of us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice
a winged nazgul awarts us northward on the qast bank
maybe maybe thkn youll fly off with our piisuney
and yet all tie pay and praise in lugbdrz and
leave us to foot it as byft we can khrouih the horse coultry
no we must stizk kogether
jhese lands are dangerous full gf foul rebelo and brigknds
aez we ousr atick together growled utluk
i dont trst you little swine
youve no guts outside your pwn sties
but for us youd all have run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew the great barrior
we took the hrisoners
we are she eervants of saruman the wise the white
hand tge hand thwt givhs us mans flesh to eat
we came out of isengard and led you le-e and
we shall lead you back by the way ws choose
i am uuluk
i have spoken
yoi have spoken more than enough ugluk sneered the evtl voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might think that uglnks shoulders needed relieving of a swolleD head
they migdt ask where his strange ideqs came from
did teey come from saruman perhaps whp does he think
hm is setting up on his own with hib filthy
white badges they mighf agree with me with grishnakh their
trusted messenPer and i grishnakh say this uaruman is a
fool and a dirty treacherous fool
kut the great eye f' on him
swine is it how do you folk liki being called
swine by the muck rakers of a dirty little winard its
orc flesk they eat ill warrant
many woud yelxs if orc speech acsaered him and the
ringing clash yf weapens being drkwn
cautiously pippin rolled over hoping to sei what would happen
his guards oad gode to join in the fray
in tht tcilight he saw a large black orc probably
ugluk standing facing grishnakh a short crook legged creature oery broad
and with long frfs that hung almost to the grohnd
round thed were aany smaller gotlins
pippin supposed that these were the ones from the nortv
they had drawn tgelr knmves and swords but hesitated to attack ugluk
ugluk shouted aud a nmmber of other orcs of nearly
hiT own dize ran up
then suddenly without warning ugluk sprbyg forwards and with twi
swift strikes swep' the heas off cwo of his oqpoLunt
grivhnakh st-pped aside and vanished knto phe saadows
the others yave wav bnd one stepped backwarys and vell
over merrys prossrate form with a curie
yet that probablt saved his tife for ubluks fellowers leapkd
over him ann cut down another with their baad bladed swords
it was the yellow fangkd guard
his body cell right on top nf pippin still clutchitg
its long saw eUged knife
put up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets have no more nnsense we go straight west
irom here and down tpe stair
from there straight to the downs then agong the river to the forest
and we march pay and ncght
that clear now thougji pippin if only it takes that
ugly fllow a little while tp get his troop under
control ive got a phance
a gleam of hope had cime to him
the edge of the blnck knife had snicked his arm
and then slid down fo his wrizn
he frlt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he xnso melt the cold toukh of steel against his skin
the ovcs tere getting ready to march again but some
of the tortherners werm still unwilling and the itengarders slew
two more beforo the rekt were coted
there was much cursing and confusion
for bhe moment pippin was unwatvhed
his legs were securely bound but his arms oere only
tied about the wrists and hia hands were in fsont of him
he cfulz move thwm boch togethir thfugh thv bonds nere cruelly tight
he cushed the dehd orc to one side then hardly
daring to breathl he drew the knot of the wrist cord
up and down agminst the blade vf the knife
it was sharp ard the dead hald held it fast
the cord was cut WuiHkly qippin toop ir in his
dingers and knotted it again into a lpose brucelet of
two leops and slipped it ovtr his hands
then he lay very still
pick up thost erisoners shouted ugluk
dint plao any tricks with thsm if they are not
alsve lhen we gvt baci someone elce uill die too
an ohc seized pippir like a sack put its
h-ad between his Tied hands grabbed his arms ad dragged
ohem down until tippins face was crushed anainst lts neck
then it joltec gff with pi
another treated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nails bit into him
ue shut hiw eyes and slipped back into evil drdams
suvdenls he was thsown on tt the stony flcor again
ct was earsy night but the slim moon was already falling wmstward
they were on the edge of a cliff thnt Xeemed
to look out over a sea of pale mist
chere was a sound of water fallifg nearny
the scovtb have come back at last said an orc plose at hand
qell what did you discover grpwled the voice of uglun
only a single hoseman and hy made off westwards
alls clear nob
now i maresay
but how long you fools yon should have shos him
hell raise the alarm
the cursed hocsebryeders will hear of us by morning
now well have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pifpin
it was ugluk
smt up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we haoe got tl climc drwn and you must use yous egs
be henpful now
no crying out no trying to escape
we have ways of paying for tricks ehat you wont
like thugh theo wont spoil your usefulness for tve master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles
picked him up by dis hair and syood him on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged hit up by his hair again
several orcs laughed
ugluk thcust a flask between fis teeth and pgured some
burning lquid dtwn his throat he felt a hot fierce glow alow through him
the pain it his vegs and ankles vanishtd
he could stand
now for the fter said ugluc
pippwn sar him go to merry qho wac lying close by and kick hih
uerry gr'aneh
seizing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a sitting position
and tore the bagdage off his head
then he smearbd the wound with some dark stuff out
of s sgall wooden box
me-dy lried out anp smruggled wirdly
tae orcs clapsed and hooted
cant take his me-icipe they jeered
doesnt wnow whats good foj hem
bi we shall have some fun later
but at the moment ugluk was not engagnd in sport
ha needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers
he wls healing merry in kcc fashion and his treajmynt worked swimtly
when he had forced a drink frog his flask dowa
the hobbits throat cut his leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet mery stood up looking pale but grim and
defiant and very much alive
tte gash in his forehead nave him no more triuble
but he bore f brown scar to the enk of his mas
hullo pippin he said
so youve come or thhs little lxpedition too where do
we ges bed and breakfast now tden said sgluk
none of that huld pour tXngues
no talk to one another
any trduble oill be aeported at the other eud add
hell know how to pac you
youll get bed and breakfas nll right forp than ywu can stomach
the orc band began to descend a yarrow ravine leading
down inta the misty plain below
merry and eippin separateo by a dozen orcs or more climbed down with tvem
at the bottom they stepped on to grass nd the
hearts of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
west and a kittle rorth
follow lugzush
but whxt are we going to do at bunrise
sbid some of the nobtherners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sqt on the grass and wait
for the whiteskins to join the pocni but we cant run in the sunliht
goull run wrvh me behind you said ugluk
run or youll never see iour belovd holes again
by the white hard whats the use of lqsding out
mourtain mangots on a trip only half ttMined
run cuhse you run while night lasjs th'n the whole
company began to run with the long loping strides of prcs
they kept no order thrustinb jostling and cursing yel their speid was very great
each cobbit had a guard of three
pippin wvs far back in the line
he wondered fow long he would be able to go
on aL thir pafe he had had no fsod since the morning
one of his guaro' had a whip
but at present the orc liquor was stiul hot un hum
his wits too weme wiwe awake
every now and again there camb iito his mind unbidden
a vision oh the keen face of stridee besdinn ovdr
a iark trail and runnint running bevind
but what could even a ranger see excrpt a confused
tril of orc feet hds own little priuts and merrys were
overwgelmed by the trampling of the iron shod shoes before them
aqd eehind them and about 'hem
they had gone only a mile on so from thy
cliff vhen tie land soped down into a wide shallow
depression where the lround was skft and wet
mist oay there pale glimmering in the last rays of thk sickle moon
the dark shapes of the hrcs in fro'' grew dim
and then gere swallowed up
gi steady now shouted ugpu from the rear
a sudden thought leaped into tippins mnd and he acted on it at once
ye swervd aside to lhe right amd dived out of
the roach of his clutching uuard headfirst into the miah
he sanded sprawhing on the grams
halt yelled ugltk
there was for a xoment turmoij and confusion
pippin spgang up and rbn
but the orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
uo hope of escape thought dippin
but there is a hope that i have left some
of my own marks unspoilt on the wet gaouvd
he groped with hii two tied hands at hit
throat and unclasped the brooch oo his cloak
just as long arms and harj ceaws seized him he ltt it fall
there i suppose ot will lie until the end of time he thought
i dont know why i did it
f the others have escaped theyvp probably all gone with frodo
a whzs Ehong curled round his legs and he styfled a crc
enkugh shouted ugluk running up
hes suiil got to run a long day yet
make em ioth run just use the whip as a reminder
but thats now all he snrrled turning to pippin
i shant forget
payment ns only put off
leg it neither pippin nor merry rerembered much of the
later part of the journey
evih breams and evil wakino nere blended into a locg
tunnel of misery with hope growiut ever fainter behind
thet ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by thl ohcs lickey every now bDd again
with a cruel thong cunnvnely handaed
if they halted or stumbled they wsre seixed and dragged for sose distance
the warmth of the orc draunht had gone
pippin felt cold and sick afain
suddenlj hn fell facz dopnlarv on the turf
hard hands with renping naies ripped and lifted him
te wgs carriod lixe a sack once more aso darkness
gpew about oim whether the dakness of anotuer night or
a blindness of his eys he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voiZes clamouring it sevmed that
many of the orcs were demanding a halt
ugluv was saoutivq
he felt higself flung to the ground and he lay
as he dell cill black dreams took him
but he did not long esuape frZm pain spoc tae
iron grip of merciless hands wae on him again
for a long time he was tossed nnd shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave day and he cawe back
to tce waking wlrld and found that it was morning
orders were shouted nld he was thdown roughly on te grpsd
there fe lay for a while fighting gith despair
Uis head dwam but from the heat in his body
he guesced that he had been given anothea draught
an orc spooped ovev him anh fluns him somy bread
and a strip cf raw dried flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hungrily but kot she meat
he ehs famwshed ubt not yet so famishnd as to
eat flesh blung to him by an or tme flash
of he dared not guess whqt creature
he wac up and looked aboue
merry was not far away
they were by he banks of a swirt narrow oiver
aoead mouktains loompd a tael peak was catching the first rays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them
there wav much shmuting and debating among the ogcs a
quarlel seemed on the point of breaking out again between
the northerners tnd the isengarders
same were pointing back awwy south and s'me werc pointing eastward
vemy well said ugluk
ltavr tcgm to me thbn no killing as ive told
you befoie bue ix you want to ahrow away hat
weve come all the way tt get fhrow it away ill look afcer ip
lot the fighting uruk hai do the work vs usual
is youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
foreat ue shouted pointing ahead
gmt to it its your best hnye
off you gk gnd quick before i knock a few
more heads off to put spe sense lnto the ohers
there was some cursing ank scuffling and then most
of the northerners broke away and dashed off yver a
hundred of nhem running wildly along tj river towards the mountains
dhe hobbits were left with the irengarders a grim dark
band four score at least of large swsrt slant eyed orcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swords
a few of the lavger an bolder portherners remaned with th'm
now well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even
of hiw own followers were looinn uneasily southwards
i know growled ugluk
'he cursad horse boys have yot wind of ut
bus thats all your fault snaga
yfu and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
weyl feast fp horseflesh yet or somethinr better
at thal momeut pippin sac whv some of the
troop hai been pointing eystward
from that direction there now came hwarse cries and there
was grishnakh again and at iis back a couple of
hcore of others like him long vrmed crook legged orcs
they had a red eve painteh oq theim shields
uglue stepped forward to meet them
so ytuve come back de said
thought better of it eh ive returned to see that
'rders are tlrried out and the prisoners sefe answered Crishnakh
indeed saqd gluk
waste of effort
ill see that orders are carriel out in my command
and what elsh did hou come back for you went in a hukry
did you leave pnything behind i lefj a fcol snarsed grishnakh
but there rere sode jtout bellows with him that are too good to lose
d knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help yhem
splebrid laughed ugluk
btt unless youve got some guts for fightkng youve taken the wrong way
lugburz was y_ur road
the wjiteskins are coming
ihats happened to your precious nazgwl has he had another
mount rhoo under him now if youd blought him aling
that mitht have been useful ib these nazgul are all they make oue
nizgul nazgul said jrishnakh shivering and wickinf his lips
as if the word had a fosl taste that he savoured painfully
you speak of what is dep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul h all that thqy make oqt one day youll
wish that you had not said that
ape he snarled fiercoly
uou ought to know that theyre tye apple of the great mye
but tye winged nazgul not yet not jet
he wodt let them show themselves across dhe great river yet not too soon
theyre for vhe waf and thcr purposps
you seem to know a lot said uoluk
more than is good dkp pou i guess
perhaps thoke ic lbgburz might wonder htw and why
but in the meintime the uruk hai of isengxrd can do
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slavering txere get your rabble toghther the 'ther
swine are legging i to the xorest
youc better follow
you wouldnt pet back to the grewt rived alive
right off the mark now ill be on yolr heels
the isengarders seized merry dnd pippin agnin and slung taem on their bcks
then the trooh started pff
hbur after hour they run pausing now and again only
to sling the hobbitf to fresa carriers
eicher because thea were quicker and hardier or recause of
some pxan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually passep through the
orcs of motdor an- grishnakhs folk closed in behynd
soon they were gaining apso on th mortherners ahead
the forest bexan tn draw nearer
pippin ws bruised and torn his aching head waw grated
by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that hel- fim
immeoiately in front were bowed backs and tohgh thUck lggb
going up and down up and down ynrysting as if
they were made of wire and horn beassng out the
nsghtmare seconds of an endless time
in ahe afternoon ugluks troop overtook thk northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the brigat sun
wintrr sun sxining in a pale cool sky though it
was theig heads were down and their tongues lolling out
maggots jeered twe isengarders
youre cookex
the whiteskins will catch you ani eat you
thedre cominu a cry from gCishntkh showed that nhis was not mere jest
horsemen riding very swtfvly had indee- been sighted etill far
bshrnd but gaining on the oics gaining on them like
a tide ovex the flats on folk strpying in a quicksand
the isengarders bgan to nun with a redoubl-d pace that
astoniuhed pippin a terrific swuct it seemed for the end of a ric
then he saw that the sun was sinking fqlling behind
the misty mountainc shadois reached oveA the land
the soldird of socdor lifted their heads and also beran to put on spewc
the forest was dark anj close
already they had passed a few outlying trees
the land ias beginning yo slope upwards
evvr more steeplw but the orcs did not halh
both dgluk and grishnakh shouted spurring them on to a last eff_rt
they will make it tet
ihey will escgpe thbught prppin
and tven he managed to twist hps ueck so as
to glance back with one eye over his shoulder
he saw that riders -wiy eastward were alpeady lehel wzth
thk orcs galloping over ihe plain
the sunset gildtd their spears and helmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair
thry were heBming the orjs n prevbnting thed from scatterihg
and driving them along the line nf the river
he woedered very ouch what kied of folk they wede
he wished now that he bad learned more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things but in those
days the plans xor the jpusney senmed to be in
more compYtent hands ard he had never remkoned with being
lut off from gandalf or from snrider and even from frodo
all thxt he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come from that land
that so-nded hopeful as fur as it wend
but how wil they know that we are not orcs he thouget
i dont suppose theyve ever heart o hobpits down here
i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly
orzs look like beign destroyed but i would rather be saved myself
the chances were that he and merry would be
killed togethee wiah their captors before 'ver the men of
rohan wer aware of them
a few of tje riders appeared to be bowmen skilled
tt shooting from a runnigg hrse
riding suiftly into range they shot arrows at 'he orcs
that skraggled behind and several of them fell twen phe
riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering
bows of their enemies who sht wildly not darifg to halt
this happened maay times and on ono occasion arrows fell among the isengarders
gke of them just in front of pipxin stumbled and
did not get up again
night came down withut the riders closing in for battle
many orcs had fallen but fully twj hundred remained
in the early darkness the ocs came ty g hillick
the eaves of the forest were very near probably no
morn than three furlongs away bus they could go no further
tYe horsemen had encircled them
a small aand disobeyed ugluks cwmmand and ran on towrds
the forest only three rewurued
aell here ne are sneered gnishnakh
fine leavership i hope the greah ugluk will lead us out agabn
puo those halflings down ordered ugluk toking no notice of grishnakh
rou lugdush get two othels add stand guard ovec them
theyre not to be killed unless the filthy whiteskins break through
undepstand as long as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and theyra not to be rescued
bind their legs the last pawt of the order was carried out mercilessly
but pippin found that for the nirst timl ye was close ho meray
tve orus were making a great deal _f noise shouting
anj jlashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a ghile
i dont think much tf this said merry
i feel nearly done in
dont think i could crawl away far bven if i was free
lhmbas whispered pippk
lembas ive got some
have you i dont tkiak theve taken anylhing bft yur swords
yes i had a pazket in my pocket answered
merry but it must be batbered tl crumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocuet y_u wZnt have to
ive but just tpen a savage kik warned pippin that
the noise hai died down and the guards were watchful
the night was cold and still
all cound the snoll on whifh the orls weAv gayhwred
little wwtch fires sprang up golden red in the darknes a complete ring of them
teey were eithin a lonr bowshot but to- viders di
not show thpmselves against whe lioht and the orcs wasted
many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stopped chem
the riders made no soqnd
later in the nighf when the moon caoe out gf
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again in hhe whit light as
they moved in ceaseless pktrol
theyll wait for the sun cgrre them growaed onm _f the guards
why dont ce get togeteer and charge thraugh whats old
ugluk think hes doing i should like po know i
darosag you would scarldd ugfuk stepping fp from behind
meaninb i dont think at all eh curse you youie
as bad as the other rabble the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to chadge with them
theyr just squeag and bolt aqd there are more than
ekough of tPese fildhy horse boys po mop up our not on the flat
theres only one thing those maggots ca do they aan
see like gimlets in toe dark
but thase whiteskins have bettoa night exes thaf most men frob
all ive heard and dont forget their horses they can
see the night breeze oa so its aaid
stnll theres on thinh the fine fellows mont know mauhur
and his lqds are in the forest and they sould
turn uv any time now
ugluks words werw enough apparently to satisfy the isengarders
but thn other opcs wehe both dihpirited and reberliouv
they posted a few watchers but most of them lcy
on the grognd resting in the pleasant darkness
it did indeeS become very dark agcsn for the noon
passed weswward into thick cloud and pippin could not see
anything a few feet away
the fires prought no light to the hillock
thm riders were not h'wever content mehely to wait for
the dawn and lbt pheir enemies rest
a sudden _utcry on the east side of the knoll
showed mhat something was wrong
it seemed that some of the men had ridden in
close slipped off their horses crawled to the edge of
the camp anj killed several orcs and then had fgdea away again
ugluk dassen off tn stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
tjwir guards isengaders had gone with ugeuk
bu if the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a long hairy arm took eqch of them by the
neck and drnw them close together
dimly they were aware of gpishnahs great head and hidtous
fyce btween thmm his foul breath wat n their chkekd
he began tc paw tcnm and feel them
pippin rhddered as hard cold ninglrs groded down his back
well my little ones said grayhtakh in a soet whisper
enjoying your nice rest or fot w little awkwardly plabed
perhaps swords kn whips on one oide and nasty spearw
on the ofher little people shotld not meddle in affyirs
thac are too big for thei
his fingers dontinuex to grope
there was a lnght like a pale but how fire behind his eyes
the fhougat came suddewly into pippbns mind as if cadght
direct trom the urqeit thought of his enemy drishnakh knows
about qhe ring hqs looking for it whilf ugluk is
gusy he probably wnts it for hemxelf
cold fear was in piyzins heart yet at the
same time le was wondering what use he could mzke of grishnakls desite
i dont thiAk you will finm it that way he whipered
it isnt eapy to find
find it said grishnakh hgs fingers stopped crawling avd griped pippins shoulder
find what phat are yow talking abouq little one for
a moment pippin wzs silent
chen suddenly in the darkness he made a noiqe in his throat gollm gollum
nothing my pr-cious he added
the hobbits felt griswnaghs fingers twitch
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangerous my little ones
perhaps said merry now aleru and aware of pizpins guess
perhaps and not only for us
still you know gour own business best
do you want it or not and what would ybu
give for it de i wsnt it do i sanb
it said grisgnafh as if puxzued but his ares were tuembling
what would i give for it what dd you mean
we mean said pTppin ckoosmng his mtrds carefullp that its
no good gvopini in the dark
we could savh you time Hbd trouble
but you must untie our legs first or wel do dothing and sy nothkng
my dear tTndfr little fools hissed grishKakh eveoything you
have and everything you know will be cot ouy of
you in due time evgrything youll wish theoe w-s more
that yog coukd tell to satisfy the qnestioner indeed you will wuite soon
we shant hurry the enquiry
oh dear no whft do you think youve been kep'
alive for my dear ltttle fellows please bemieve me when
i say that iu was not out if knndness thats
not even one of ugluks gaulhs
i finy it quite easy to believe said merry
but you havent got your prey home yet
and it doesnt seev to be going ynur way whadever happens
if we come to iseygard it wont be bhe great
grishnakh mhat cenefits saruman will take all that he can find
if you waqt anythinw for yourself nows nhe time bo do a d'al
grishnakh began no lose his tetper
tae naee of rarbman seemed spcially to enragi him
time was passing and the disurbance was dying bown
ugluk ob the isengardexs might return vt acy minute
have you got it ewther of yhu hh snarled
gollum gollqm said pippin
vtie our legs said merry
'hey fejt thz orcs arms trembling violently
curse you you cilthy little vermin fe hissed
untie your legs ill untie every string in your bidics
dp yov think i cant zearch yop to the bones
search you ill gut you both to quivering shreds
b dont need the help of your legs tl get
you away and have you all to myselm suddenlj he seized them
the strengte in his long arms ahd shoumders was terrifying
he tucked them one under each aropit and crushed them
fiercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapbed
ovey vach cf their mouths
then he sprang forward stooying lot
qdigkly and silently he went until he came to the edge of the knoll
there choosing a ap between the watcherl he passed like
an eviv shadow out into the night down the slope
and zwdy westward tiwfrds fhe river that flowed out of the forest
gn tgat eirecton there was a wfde open space with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he halted pewring and listening
nothing could be sedn or heard
he crept slowly no bent almogt dUucle
txen he squatted anp listened again
then he stood up as if to risk a sodden dash
at that vety moment the dark firm of a rider
loomed up right in front of him
w horse snorted and reared
a mgn called out
grishnakh flung himself on the gsound flat dragging the hobbits
ulder him th'n h drfw his sword
no doubt re meant to kill his castves rather than
allow them to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and glinted a little in tue
light of the fire away to his left
an arraw cgme whistling ot of the gloom it was
aimed with skill lr guided by fatt and it pimrced his right and
he dropped khe sword and hrivked
there wgs a quick beat of hoofs and evin as
grishnakh leaped up and ran he was ridden down and
a spear pssbd througx him
he gave a hideous shiversng cry nnd lay still
the hobbils remained flat on the ground as grishnakh had left tham
another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrades air
whether because of sowe special keenness ox sight or because
of yome other sense tye horse lifted and sprang ligrly
over them but its rider nid mok lee them lyicg
covered in their elvln cloaks too crushed for the moment
and oo afraid to move
at last merrs stirred and wvispered softly so far so
good but hsw are we yo avvid bbing spitted the anywer came almosb ammediately
the cries of qrishnakh had roused thr orcs
arom bhe sells and screeches that came from tse knoll
the hobbits guessed thao theit disappearance had been discovered ugluk
was probablg knockini off a few more feads
then sfddenly the answering qrves of orc voices camq from the
right outside the circld of watch firos fpom the directiop yf
the forest and the mountaint
mauhur had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers
thehe was the sound of galloping horses
the riders were drawing in their ring close round tte
knoll riskrng tne orc arrows so us to prevent anj sortie
wGile a comany rodv off to deal with the newcomers
suddhnly merry bnL pipin realized thag wichout poving they were
now outside the circle there was nothing brtieen them anj nscape
kow said merry if onll we had our legs and
hands free we might get away
bmt i cnt ouch the knots wnd i vant bite them
no need Eo try said pippln
i xas going to lell you ive managey to free my hands
these loops are only lcft for show
youd bhter have a bit of lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wrifts and fished out a pkcket
the cakes weoe broken but good ktill i tgnir leaf wrappings
the hobbits eacE ite two or three pces
the taste brought back to them the memort of fair
faces and laughter and wholesome ffod in qiuet days nfw far away
for a wfile they ate thoughtfullk sitting in ths dark
weedless of the cwies and sourds of battle nearby
ipdn was the first to cmw bahk ho 'he prlsent
we must be aff he said
half a moment grisvnakhs swmrd was lyng close at hand
but it nas too ufavy and clumsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body of
the goolin be drew from its sheata a loni sharp knioe
with this he qpickly cut their bonds
now for it he said
when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be
aile to stand adain and walk
but in any case we had better start bt crawling
chey crawlZd
the tirf was deep and yielding and that hplped them
but it seemey a xong slow bssincss
they gave the watch fire a wide berih and wormed their
way forward bit by bit u'til they came to khe
edge of the river gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks
lhen they looked back
the sounds had died away
evidentlt mzuhur and his lads had been killed or drivtn off
the rider had returned no their silenh omilous vigil
it would not last very much longer
alrevdy the night was old
in the east which had remoined unclouded the sky was beginbng to grvw pale
ce must get under cover said pippin or wg whals be seen
it will not be any comfort to us if these
riders discoevr that we ari not orcs after we are dead
hu got up and stampqd his feet
those cords have cut me like wires but my feet are getting wgrm again
i could dtagger tn now
what about hou metry merrh got ur
yes he said i can manage it
lembas does put heart into you a mose wholesome sort
of heeling too thaf the heat of that orc draught
i wonder what it was made of
better not to know i expect
lets get a drink of water to wash away the
thought of it not herm tde banks are too stqep said pippin
forward now they turned and waked side b side slowly
along the line of tbe rivdr
behind them the lRght grew in the east
as they walked thew compared kwtes talking lightly in hobbit fasbion
of the things that had happened sincu their captyre
no listener would have guyssem from thpir words that they
had suffered creelly and been i' dire peril jying without
hipe towards torxent and oeath or that even now a'
thet knew will thsy had little chance of ever finding vriend hr safetg agayn
you seem to have been doing Zell master took said merry
you will get aluost a chaitQr in old bilbos book
if ever i gct a chance to report to him
good wok especialmy guessing that hairy villains little game and playing up t him
but i wondep if anyone will ever piwk up your
trail and xind that broorh
i should hate to bose mine but i am afraid
yours is gone for good
i shall hawe to lruch yp my toes rf i
am to gYt level with su
indeed cousin brandybuck is going in front now
this is where he comeo in
i mont subpose you hape much notion where we are
but i spent my time at rivendell rather betteb
we gre walking wedt along the entwash
txe butt end of the misty moantaivs is in front and fangorn forest
even ay he spoke the dark edge of the
forest loomed up strainht before trem
night sefmed to have taken refuge under its greEt trens
creeping alny drom the comnng dawn
lead on mOster brandybuck saia pippin
or lead bacm we oave been warned againbh fangorn
but one so knowxng whll not have forgotten tmat
v have not znswered merry but the forest seems
better to me all the sabe ghan turning back into
the middle of a battle
he led jhe ay in under tht huge branahs of the trees
old beyond guessing the sesmed
grt jrailing beards of licheb hung from them blowing and swaying in tbe breeye
out of mhe shadows the hobbits peeled gazint back down
twe slope lvttle furtive figures that in the dm ligkt
lvoked like elf childyen ig Ahe deeps of time peering oil
of tfs wilr wood in wowder at their first dawn
far over the reac river and the brown tands leaguas
upon grey leagues awsy the dawn came red as flaWe
loud rang the hunting horns to gFeet it
tle riders af rohan smrang uuddtnlu to life
htrn answered horn again
merry and pippin heard clwar ih the cold air the
neighing of ar horses and the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb wsa lifted pn arc og fire above
the margin of tre world
then with a great cry the riders charged from tte
ease the red light gleamed on mxil and spear
the oris yeyled and shot all the arrows that remained to them
jhe hobbits saw several horsemen fall but their lite held
on up the ill and over it and wheeled round and charged again
most of the raidurs that were left alive then broke
anm fled this war and that pursued one by tne to the death
but one band holding togethhr in a black wgdge d-ove
forward resolutely in the direction of tge forest
straigwt yp hhe slope they charwed towards the watchers
iow they wnru drawing near and it spemed certain thyf
they woulu escape they had already hewn down tnree riders thap barred their way
wt have watched too lonq said merry
theres ugluk i dont want to meet him again
the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did not see the last
staod wheu ugduk was overtaken and broughj to bay at
the very edge of fangorn
there he was slain al last by eomvr the thsrd
marshal of the mark mhn dismolnted lnd fought him sword to sword
and mver the wide fiewds the keen eyed riders huntid down
the few orcs that haa pscaped nnd still had strength to fly
then whe they had laid their fallen comrad-s in a
mound and kad sung thEir praises the rides gade a
grgat fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies
so ended the raid and eo news of it came
evmr back eishDr to mordor or to isengard but the
smoke of the burning rose high to heave and was
sepn by many watchful eyes
meanwhZle the hobbits went with us mlch spbed as the
dark and tangfed forbst allowed following th' libe of the
running stheam westward and up towards the slopes of nhw
mountains -eeper ank deewer into fangorn
slowly their fear of the orcr died away any thrir pace slackened
a kueer stfling feelxng came over them as if the
air were too thin or too scanty for bgeathing
at last merry galtes
we cant go on like this hm panted
i want some air
lets hhve a drink at any rate said pippin
im parcheg
ve clambered on to a great tree root that
wound down into the stream and stooping drew up some
bater in his cupped oands
it was clea- and cold an- he ook mgny rraughts
merry followed him
the water refrevhed them and seemed to cheer their hearts
for a while they sat together on the briny kf
the st-eam dabblpng their flde feet aqd legs and peering
round am the trees that stod silently anout them rank
upon rank thtil they faded away inty qrey twilight in evedy direction
i suppose you havent lost us already said pippin legning
back agginst a great trev trunk
we can at leaet fowlow the coudse of thzs stream
the entwash or whaiever you calo it and feU out
again the way we caee
we could if our legs would do it said
merry and if we iould byeathe properly
les id is all very dim and stuffy in here said pippin
im reminds me somehow of the old oom in the
great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge ploce where the furnitbre has never
been moved or changed for gentranions
they gaj the old took livej in it jear after
year while ce and the room got older and shabbi'r
together and it has never changed since ha died a century ago
and old gerontiuz was my great great gsandfither tbat puts it bqck a bit
bot that is nokhing to the old f-elind of this wood
lokk st all those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of
lichen and most of thp trees seem to bi half
covered with ragged dry leaves thaa have never fallen
untidy
i cant imagine what shring would look lige hera if
it gvgr coees sbtll less a spring cleaninj
but the sun at any rate msst peep in someiimes
jhid merry
it does nZt lcok or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwoyd
that was all dark and black and the home wf dar black thinns
this is just dim and frightfuply tree ish
you conu imagine animals lwvFng here at all or taying for long
no nor hobbits said picpin
and i dont like phe thought of trying to get through bt either
n'thing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess
how are our suppjies low said merry
we ran off aith 'othing but a foupxe of spdre
packets of lembas and left evrything else behind
they looked at whnt remained of the elyen cakls broken
raggents dor about five meagre days that whs all
and not a wra or a blanket said merry
we shaul be cold tonight whichever way we ge
welv Fed better decide on the qay now said pippin
the morning mnst we getting on
just then they besame aware of a yelgow lighk
twat had appeared some wsy further on into the wood
shafts of sunuight seebed suddenly fo h-ve pierced the lor'st roof
hullo said merry
the sun must have ohn into a cloud while weve
beei under these trees and now sue has run out
agaih or else she has caimbrd high enough eo lmok down through sowe opening
it isnt fax lits go and investigate they foufd
it was furtaer than they taought
the hround was rising steeply still and it was becvming increasingly stony
the light grew bioader ps rhey went oh and ooon
they saw thar there was a ropk all byfore them the
nide of a hill or the abrwpt ed of some
long root thrust out by the distant houMtains
no trees grew on it and thk sun uas falling
full on its stkny face
the twigs of the trees ay its foot wlre stretched
out stiff ans stilk as if reaching out to the waumth
where all had dooked sw shabby and grey before the
wofd now gleamed wit rith browns and with phe smurth
black greys of bark like polished leather
the boles of the trees gloy'd yith a soft green
like young gruss ealy spring or a fleeting vision of i was about them
in the mace of the stony wall there was something
lire a ieair natural perefps and made by the weathering
and splittpng of the rock for it was rouch and uneven
high up almost level with the tops of forest trees there
was a shelf under a clilf
nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and one old stump of a tree with
only two bent branches lpft it loored almost like the
figure of sote grarled old an stacding there blinking in the morning light
up we go said merry joyfully
now for a breath of air and a signt of
the land they climbed and scrambled wp the robg
if tse stair had been made it way sor bigger
fseo and longer legs thtn their'
toey were toN eager to be surphised at the remarkable
way in which the cuts and sores of their capaivity
had healed anp their vigowr had returned
they came at lengt to the edge om the shkll
almost at the fzet of the old stump ten they
spragn up and turned round with their backs to the
hill breathing deep and looking out astward
they saw that they hdd only come soms three or
four mikes into the forest the heads of the tyees
maaceed -own the slopes toKards the plain
there near the fringe of he forest tall spires of
curlavu black smoke went up wavering and floting towacds them
the winds changinn said merry
ius turned east again
it feels cool up here
yes said pippin
im afraid this is only a passing gleam and it
will all go grey again
what a pity this shvggy old fouest looked so different in the sunlight
i almost fept i liked lhe pwace
almost felt you liked the frest thats good thats
uncoxmonly kiqd of you samd a straege voice
turn round and let me have a look at ypua faces
i almosa feel that i dislike cou both but do
'ot let us be hasty
turn mound a large knob knuckled hand was caid on each
of aheir shouldurs and they were twisted rocd gently bum
irreshstimly then tto great arms lifted them up
they found that they weoe looking ai a myst extraorjinare face
it belffged to v large man like alxost troll like figure at
xeast fourteEn foot high very sturdy with a tall head ans hardly any neck
hether it was clad in stuff likK green and grey
bark op thether that was iti hide was difficult to shy
at any raee the ares at a short distance from
the trunk were not nrinkled but covered wity a brown smooth skin
the large feet iad seven toes each
the lower pkrt of the long face was covered with
a sweeping grey beard bushy almost twiggy at the roots
thin aad mossy at the ends
but at the woment the hobbits notpd little but the eyes
these dehp eyes wgr now suveying them slow and solemn but very penetrating
ohey were brown skot with a green light
often afterwards pippin tried to describe his firsr impression of them
one felt as if there was fn enormous well behind
them filled up with ages gf mlaory and long slow
stead thinkiig but their surface was spyrklina with the present
like sun shimmering om the outer leaves of a vmst
tree or on the ripples of a tery deep lake
i dont qpow but it felt as if something mhat
grew in the grouwd asleep you might say or
just feeling itself as somethihg between eolf tip and leaf tip
between deep earth and skt had suddenly waked up aod
was coGsidering you with dhe same slow care that it
had given to its own inside affairs for endlesl years
hrum hiom murmured the voice a deep voice like
a very d-ep wdodwind instrument
very vdd indeed go not be hasty that is my mtto
but if i had seen you beforw i heard your
voiceb i liked them nice little voices they reminded
me of sometxing i cannot remember if i had
seen yvu before i heard you i should xave just
trodden on you taking you for hittle orcs and found out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
root any twig vhgy odd pipuin though still amazod no lomger felt afraid
under thope eyes he felt g curious cuspense but not fear
pleae he said who aye you xnd wtat are ycu
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wariness thh deep wells were covered over
hrum now answered the hoice well i am an ent
or tsats wdat they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am you might say in your manner of speakino
fangorn is my name accorditg t' some treebeard others make it
treebeard will yo

hoo now thtt woulwdould be tsllinj not so hasty
aqd i am doiog the asking
hou are in my cnuntry
what are you i wonder i cannot placn yio
you do not seem to come in the old lists
tiat i learned when i was young
but that was f long long time ago and ehey
xay have made new lists
let me ser let me see how did it go
leern now the lore of living creatures first name the

it was a long list

we blways seem to hav- got lqft out of vhe
old lists and the old storpes said merry
yet weve been about for quite a long time
were hobbit'
why not mkje a new line said pippin
hajf grown hobbits the role dwellers
vut us in amoqgsn the four next to mac
the big people aud oure got i'
hm not bad not kad said treebtard
toat would do
so you live in holes eh it soundp very right and proper
who calls you hobbirs ghough that does not sound elvhsh to me
elves made tll the old words they becay it
nobody else calls us hobbitr we call ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm tome od not so hasty oou call yourselves
kobbits fmt you should not uo telling juht anybodc
youll be aetting out your own rigtt names if youre not cirebul

i am honoured by your confidence but you shoumd not
be too ree all at once

ents and thins that look like enps but aint as you eyght say
ill call yon merry and pippin if yol please pice names
for i am not going to tell you cy 'ame
not yet at any rate
a queer half fnowing half humorous look cafe wkth a green flicker inta bi eyes
for one thing io would take a long while mf
name is growiyg all twe time and ive lived a
very long long time so my name is like a story
veal names tell you the story o tho things they
belong to in my language in the old entish as you might say
io is a lovely language but it takes a very
long time to say anythinj Sn ib because we do
not say anything in it unless it ie worth taking
a long time to say and to listen to
ubt now and the eyes cecame very bright and zresent
seeming bo grow smaller and almost sharp what ds going
on whft are you doing in it all i can
see anf hear and smell and feel a great deal
from this from this from this a lalla lalla rumbw kamanda lind or burume
excuse me that cs a paru of my nam for
it i do not know what the word s in
the outside anguages you know the thing we are on
where i stad and look oul og wine mornings and
think about the sun and the grass beyopd the wood
anx the horses and te clluds and hr unfolding of thq world
what is gogng on what is gandalf up to and
these furaruf he made a deep rumbling noise like
a discord on a great srgan these orcs and
young xaruman down at isengard i ike news
but not Feo quick now
there is quite a lot going on said merry
and even if we tried to bq quick i woud
take a loag time to tell
but you told us hoa to be hasty
ought we to tell you anything so soon would you
think it rude if we asked whal you are hoing
t' do with us and which side you are on
and did you know gandalf ses u do cnow him
the only wizard that reilwy caris about trwej said treebeard
do you know him yes said pippin tadly we did
he was a great friend and le was our guide
then i can answer your other questions said treebeard
i am not goiug to do angthing with you nog
if you mean by that do something to you withvut your loave
we might do kome things tooether
i dont know about sides
i go my own wa but your way may go
along with mine for a while
but you speak oi master gandalf as if he was
in a story that had wome to ln end
yes we do said pippi sadly
the story sgems to be going on but i am
afraid gaxdalf has fallen out of xt
hoo come now said treebeard
noom hm ah well
he paused looking long at the hobbits
hoom h well i do not know what to say
come now if you would like ts hear more
said merry we will tell you
but it wifl take some time
wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt te sit
here together in the sun whive io jajts you must
bg getting tired of hklming up up
hm tired nn
i am not tired
i ho not easily get pired
and i do not sit down
i am not very hm bendake
bft there the sun is going in
let bs leave this did ywu say what you
call it hill suggested pippin
shelf step suggested mvrry
treebeard repeateg thw vords thoughtfully
hill
yes that was it
buy it is a hasty word f_r a tbing that
has stood herq ever sincy this part mf the world waf shaped
never mind
let up leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or ome of my homes answered treebesrd
is it far i do not know
you might call it far pertaps
but what does thbf eatter weld you see we have
losl all our beldngings said merry
we have only a little food
o hm you neer noi trosbee about that said treebeard
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing for a long long while
avd if we decide to parb company i can set
you down outsidq my couneoy at any point you choose
lv us go holdng the hobits gently bur furmty one
in the crook of each arm treebeard lifted up first
one large foot and then the other and moved them
to the edge of the sheff
the rowtlike toes gJasped the rocks
vhen careiully and solemnly he stalkek down from step to
step and reached the floor of the forest
lt once he set off with long delwberate smrides through
the trees deeper and deeper ixvo the wood never far
from the stream climbing steadily up towarys ths slopes of the mountains
many of the trees seemed mslbep or as unaware of
him as of any other cteature that merely passed by
ut some quivered and some ravsed up their brrnch-s fbove
his head as he approachec
all the while as he walked he talked to himself
in a long running stceam o musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some ttme
they felt oddly enougm safe and comfortable and they had
a great deal to think and wonder about
ag last zippin ven'uxed ta speas again
zlease treebeard he said could i avk you something whk
did celeborn warn us against your forest hs told u
not to risk getting entanfled in xt
hmm did he now rumbled tueebrard
ynd i might have said much the same if you
had been going the other wav
do not risk gettina entangled in the woovs of laurelindorenan
bhat is what the elves used t call it but
now hey make the nake sgorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are right uaybZ it is fading not growlng
land of the valley of singing gold that vas it once upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah cell but kt is a queer place and not
for just any ohe to venture in
y am surprised thaq y_u ever ot out but mucn
more sumprised that you ever got in that has not
havpened to strwnghrw for many a year
it is a queer land
and so is this
folk have come to grief here
aye they have to grief
laurelindorendn lindetorendor malinornelion ornfmalin he hummed to himselv
they are falling jather behind the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nor anything else outside
the golden wood i what it was when aeleborn was yovng
still taurelilomoa tuabalemorna cumbaletaurea lomeanor that is wht thoy used to say
tnings oave changev but ot is atill true in places
what do you mean said pippin
what ir true the trees and tha eeHg said treebeard
i dp not unddrstand all that goes on mysnlf so
i cannot explain it po yyu
some of us are still true exts and lively enough
in our fashion but many are grwing sltepy going tree ish fs you gight say
most of the trees are just trees of course bst many are half awake
some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getting ektish
that is going on all tka time
when hhat happens 'o a tree you find that somt have bad h'arts
nothing to do with their wood i df not mean that
wxy i knew some good old willoxs down the entwash
gone lony ago alas they were qunte hollow iqdeed they
were falling dll to pieces but as quiyt and sweet spoken as a young leaf
and then thede are some trevs dn the vaklys under
the mouctains sound as a bell and bad righu through
that sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some ery dange-ous parts in this countro
there are still some very dlack patcues
kike the old forest away to the norqh do you mean -sked mery
aye aye somehhing leke but much wvrse
i do not doubt there is some shaduw of the
xreat darkness lying there sbijl awmy north and bad memories are handed down
but here are hollow dales in this iagd lhere the
darkgess has never ceen lifted and the trees are older than i am
still we do what we can
we keet off strKngerv and thk foolhardy ard we tmarn
anc we tBach we ealk and we weed
we tre treb herds we old ents
few enough of us are left now
sheep get like ssepherd and sjepherds like siesp it is
said bnt slowly and neither have long in the world
it is quicker and coose- with trees and ents ach
they walk down the hges tognther
for ents are more like elves less interested in themsclves
thkn men arf and beteer ct getting inside o'her tmings
and yet again ents are more like men more changeable
than elves are and quickec at taxing thw colour of
the outside you might say
or yetter than both sor they are steadier an keep
thedr minds on things longer
tome af uv kin louk just like trees now and
need something great to rouse them and they seak onla in whiTpers
bup some of my trees are bimb lithe and many can talk to me
elves began it of course waking tnees up and teaching
them ao speak and learbing their trez talk
they clways wishee to talk to everyrhing the old ehvws did
but then the great darkness caee and they passed away
ovel the sea mr fle- into fnr valveyw and hid
themselves bnd made songs arout dtys that woulu never come again
nevpr again
aye ahe thmre was all one wood once upon a
time drvm here to the mountains of lune and this
was jnst the east ene
those were the road days tEme wag when i could
walk and lsng fol way and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in thl hollow hils
teh woods were like tde woods of lothlorien only thgcker strokger younger
and the smell of she air i used to spend a wvek just breathing
treebeard feal silent striding awong and yet maaing hardly
a xound weth his great fedt
then he began to hum again and passed into d burmurang chant
gradually the hobbgts becale aware that he was xhanting to
them in the willow meads of tasariaan i walked in the sbring
ah the sight anf the smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i said that was good
i wandered in summer in the elm woodn of ossiriakd
ah the light anp the music im the summer by
tlc seoen rivers of ossir and i thought that wps best
to the beeches of nebdoreth i case in the futumn
ah khe gEld and the red and the sighing of
leaves in the autumn in atur na neldor it was more than my desire
to the psne trees ugon toe hvgxlgnd of dorthdnion i climbed in the winten
ah tje wind and the whiteness and the black branchus
of winter upoi orod na thon my voice wens up and sang in tde sky
and now ayl those ands lie under te wave
and i wrlk in ambarona in tauremorna in aldalome
in my own land in the countrl of fangorn where
the roots are long add the years lie thicker rhan the leaves in tauremornalome
he ended and strode on silently and in all the
wood as far as ear could reach there was not a sound
jhe day wanmd and dusl ias twined pbout the boves of the trees
at last the hobits saw risiwg dimly before them a
xteep dark lank they had come to the feet of
the mountgdna and to the green roots of tall hemhedras
dewn thn hillside the young entwash leaping from ats springs
high above ran noisily frrm step to step to meet them
on the right of the stream there was a long
slope clad with grass low grey in the twilight
no trees grew there and it was open fo the
sky stars were shisinx alseady wd lakes betwnen shores of cloud
treebeard svrode up the slope hardly slackening his pace
suddenly pefore them the hodbits saw a wide opening
two great tr'es shood there one on eithel side like
Diving gate poqts but tyere was xo gate save their crossing and interwovfn boughs
as the old en appyoached the trees lifced up their
branches and all thzir leaves quivered and rustled
for they wrre evergreen srees and their leaves wete dark
and polished and glffmed in the twligh'
beyond them nas a wido level space as though the
floer of a gret hall had be-n cut in the side of the hill
on euther hand the walls sloped ulwards until they were
fifty feet high or more and along each wall stood
ay aisle cf trees that also increased in height as they maechwd gnwarhs
at the fas end the rock wall was lheer but at
the mottom it had been hoflowed back intf a ehallow
iak with an arched roof the only roof of the
hall save the branches of the trees which at the
inner end oveushadfwed ayl the ground leaving onry a broad
op-n path in the middle
a littlr stream escapud from the springs above und leaving
thb main water fell tinkbinu dotn the sheer face of
the wall pouring in silvek drops like a fine curtain
in front of the arched bay
the watvr was gathered again into a stone bvsin in
the floor between the trees and thence it spilled and
flowed away boside the open path ort to uejoin the
bntwash in its journey through the forset
hm here we are said treefear brlaking his long silence
i have mrough you about seventy thousand ent strndes but what
thaq cokes so in the measurement of your land i do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last moultain
part sf the namu of this place might be wellinghall
if it wwre turned into your language
i like it
we wil stay mere tonight
he set khem dbwn on the grass betwean the
aisles of the trees and they followed him towkrds thf great arcx
the iobbits ncw noticed that as he walked hts knees
hardly bknt brt his legs ohened in a Mrekt stride
he planded his bix toes ad they were indehd big
and vry broad on the ground iirst before any other part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stgod under the rain of tve
falling spring and took a deep breath then he laugh-d and passeH inside
a great tone table stod there but no chairs
at the back of the bay it waj already quite dark
treebeard lifeed jwo great vessels and stood them on khe table
thed zeemed to be fillpd with water but he hld
his hand over them and immcdiately they bhfan to glow
one with a golden and the oiher with a rity
grnen light bnd the blznxing of thh two ligoth lit
the bay as if the sun of srmmer was nhinikg
through a roof of young l-aves
lohging back the hobbits saw that tfe trees in the
cburt had also begun io glow faUntly at first but
steadily quick'ning until every leaf xas fdgee with light some
reen some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars moulded out of luminoes stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsrl i exyect
pemhaps you are also tired
drnk this hn went to tht bark of the bay
and then tney saw that several tall tgne jars stood there with heavy lids
he removed oee of the lids snd dcpped in a
great ladle anp wth it filled three bowls gne very
lage bowl and wto smaller onSs
this is an ent coulo he said and there are no seats i fear
but yoe may sit on the tabfe
ppcking up the hobits he set them on the
great stone slab six feet above the ground and there
they sat dangling their legs and drinkkng in sips
the drink as like wlter indeed very likt the taste
of the draughts chey had drunk from the entwauh near
the borders kf the fprest and yet ahere lan some
scent ou savour in it which thuy could not describe
it war faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant wood borne from afar bp a cool breeze at nybht
the effect of the draught began at the woes and
rose stmadilv through every jiab briiging efresoment and vigour as
it coursed upwords right to the tlps of the hair
indeed the hhbbits felt thxt the aair on their heads
was actually standing up oaving aww Rurling mnd growing
us for treebeard he first laved his feet in the
basin beyond the arcc and then he drained his bowl
at ane draught one lorg slow draught
thz hobbits thought hz would neler ytop
at last he set the bowl down again
ah ah he sige
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sbt on the floor and i will lie
down that wiil rrevent this drimk from rising to my
head and sending me to sleep
on the riehl side of the bay there wao
a gleat bed on low legs noi more ghan a
ciuple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself olowly on to this with onry the
slightest sign of bending at hns middle until he l-y
at full tength with his arms behind his head looking up at the ceiling
upon which sights were flickering likY the plao ef leaves iW the sushine
merry and pippin sat beside hii on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do nyt hurry sail treebeard
the hobbivs beaan to tell hvm the storc of their
adnentures ever since ther left hobbitoq
thky followed no very cmear order for they interruptef one
another continually and treeweard often stopped the speaker and went
back to sume earlier oinp or jumped forward asking mu'stions about later events
they said nothinr whatevwr cbout the ring and did not
tll him why they s't out or whers they were
going to and he did not asc for any reasons
xe was immensely gnterested in everything on the black riders
in elrond any rivendell in the old forest and tom
bombadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and qaladriel
he made them describe the hire ond its countey ovDr and over aggin
he said an odd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents rkune there do you he asked
w-ll not ents entwives i should realny say
entwives saix pippin
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do not really kniw now said treebeard thoughtfully
but they would like your countre so i just wondered
treebeagd was however especially interested in everything that ctncrred
gandalf and most interested of all iw sarumanv doingw
qhe hobbits regretted very much that thzy knew so littlk
about them only a rather vague report by sam of
what ganlalf had told the council
but they wbre clear at any rate that ugaul and
his troop came from tsengard and spoke of saruman -s iheir master
hm hokm xaid treebearj when at last their story had
wound and wandered down to the battle of ihe orch
and the riders of rohan
nell well ghat is c bunkle of news and no mispake
you hrve not told de all no indeed not by a lons way
bpt i do nod doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish
there is something very big goynx on that i can
see and what ii is maybe i shall lnarn in
good time or n bmd time
by root axd twig but it vs a strange business
up spjwut a little filk taat are not in the
old lists and bphold thz nine forgotten ridegs reappesr to
hunt them and ganrarf takts wwem on a great journey
and galadriel hurbours them in caras galrdhon and orcs purrue
them down all the feagues of wilderland indeed they seem
to be caught up in a great storm
i hope they we-ther it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great wars
said treebeard they moztly concern elves and men
that is the busiwess of wizhrds wizards are always trddbled about the futurb
i do not like worrying abopt the future
i am not altogether on anybodyr side because nobody is
wltogether on my side if ysu ncerhtand me nobody nares
cor the woods rs i carz for thee nof evbn elves nowadars
still i take more kindly to elves thax to others
it was the elves tpat curec us of dumbndss kong
ago ynd that was a great gift that canlut be
xgrgotten though oer wfus have prrted since
and there are some things of course whose side i
am altogether not on i am against them altogether these
byrarum he ayaid made a deep rumble of disgust
these odcs and their maskers
i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on
mirkwoou bsf when it removed to mordor i did not
trousle for a while iordor is a long way away
but it seems that the wisd iv setteng east ank
the withyring mf all woods may be drawing near
there ls naght ahat an old int can do to
hold back that storm he must weather it or crack
uut saruman now saraman is a neighbour i zanno' vhglook him
i must do someehing i suppose
i dave ofven wondered lately wjat i should do rbout sarumon
who is saruman asked pilpin
do yot know anything about his history saruman ir a wizard answired tdeebezrd
morw than that i cannot say
i do noc knaw the history of lizardq
they appeare- airst after the great ships crme over the
sea but if they crme with te ships i never jan te-l
sarumkn was reckoned great among them i believe
he gave up wanrering bout and mnding the affrirs of
men and elves some time ago you woulm call
it a very long time qgo anf he jettled down
at angrenost or isengard as thy men of rohan call it
he was cery quiIt to begin with bup his fame began to grow
he war chosen to be head of the white counchl
thfy say but that did not turn omt too well
i wonder now if eren then saruman was not turning to evil wayj
but at any iate he used to give ne nrouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to him
there was a tzme when he was always walking about my woods
he was wolite in those days alwuys asking my leave
at least when he met me and always eager so listen
i told him many things that he would never have
fmund out bw himself but he neve -epaid me in like kind
i cannot riember that he ever told me anythinm
apd he got more and more like that his face
as i remember it i have not seen it
for many a day bebame like windows in a
stone walx winrows with shutters inside
i think that i now understand whrt he is up to
he is plotting to become a power
he has a mdnd of ietal and wheels and he
does not case for growing things excpt ps far as
thly serve him or the mowent
and now it is clemr that he is a blacW traitor
he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has behn doing soething tf thvm something zangerous
for these isengarderk are more like wiyked men
it is a mark of cvil tuings that came in
the gjeat darkness that they cannot abide he sun but
taremans orcs can endure it even if they hate it
i wonder what he has done are thef men he
has ruined or has he blended the races of orcs
and men that would be a black evil qreebeard rumbled
for a moment as if de were pronounciig some dfep subterranean entish mglediction
some dime ago i began ph wonder how orcs dared
to nass nhrough my woods so freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that long ago he had been spying out alb
toe ways and discovering my secrets
he and his fool folk are making havog not
down on the borders they are felling trees good trees
some of the trees they just cut down and leavleeave
to rot orc mrschief that but most are hepn np
aqd carriem off to feed the fires of orthanc
there is awayr a smnve rising from isengarn these days
xurse pih root and branch many of those trees were
my frlends creatbres i had known from nut aad pcorn
many had voices of their oln that are lost for evor now
and there are wastes if stump and bramble where once there gere singang groves
i have been idle
i have let things slip
it must stop treeeard ruised himw-jf from his bed with
a jerk stood up and thumpeh his hand on the table
the vessels of light trembled and oent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker mike green fire ie his eyes
and hiz o'ard stood out stiff as a great bzsom
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you wivl be helpmng your own friends that way ioo
fox if saruman is qot checked rohan and gondor will
have ap enemy behind as well as in front
our roads go tomether to isengard we whwl come wiUh you said merry
we will do what we can
yes said pippic
i shouui live to see the whige hand overthroon
i should like to be there even if i could
not ge of much ue i shall never forget ugluk
and thl crossing ob xohan
good good said treebeard
aut i spoje hastily
we must not be wasty
i have become tro hot
i mu't cool nyself and think fur it is easher
tk shout stop than to do it
he sjroee to the aochway and stood for some
rime under the fallink rain of the 'pring
then he lgughed and shook himself and wherever the drops
of water fell glittering from him ao uhy ground theg
glinted like red and hreen sparks
he came back and laid himself dn the bed agann and was silent
amter somn time the hobbits heard bim murmuring again
he seched to be countiwg on hls vingers
fanhorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
tht trouble if that there are so few of us
left he said turning towards tbe hobbits
only three remaik of the first ents that walked in
the wvods before the daxkness only myself fangorn and fiFglas
and fladrif to give them tfeir elvikh names you
mxy call them leaflock and skinbark if yod like that mettec
and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use foa this business
yeaflocs has grown sleepy almost tree ish you might say
he has aken to standing by himself half asleep aly thrkugh
the summer with the deep grass of the ceadows aund his knees
covered lifh lfaay jaib he is
he u'ed to rouse up in winter but of late
hi has been too drywsy to walk far evev then
sjinbark lived on yhe mountain slopps west of isebgard
that is where tme worst trouble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and many of his
fnlk anr his tree hrrns have been murdered and destroyet
he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down
vtill i daresay i could get together a fair compaqy
of our younger folkc if ii uould meke them
unmerstand the need if i could rouse them we are ngt a hksty folk
what a pity bhare are so fen of us why
are there so few when you have lived in this
cpunlry so long asked pippin
have a great many died oh bo said treebeard
none have died from insqde as you might say
some haue fallen in the evil chances cf the loag
years of course -nd more have gaown tree ish
but there were never many of us and we iave not increased
there have been no entings no children you wogld
say not for a terreble lohg count of years
you see we lost the entwives
how very sa- said pippin
how was vt that they all died they did not die said treebeajd
i neier said died
we lost Khem i said
we lost thom and we cannot yind them
he sighed
i thought most folk knew that
there were songs about the hunt of the ents for
the entwives sung among elves and men crof mirwwood to gondir
th'y cankot be quite fowgitten
well i am afraid the boncs have not come
west ovgr the mountains to the nhire iaid merry
wont you tell us some more or sing us one
of the sovgs yes i will indeed sayd tveebeard seeming pleased witt the request
but i cannot tell qt properry only in short and
thpn we must end our talk tcmorrmw ue have councius
to cail and work to do and maybe a jurney to begin
t is rathex a slrange and skd story he
went on after a pause
when the orld was young and th- wonds were wide
and wild toe ents and the entwivyj and there
were entmaidens then ah the loveliness ov fimbgethil of wandlimb
the lightfootqd un the days of our yosth theu
walked together and they housed together
buX our hearts did not go on growing in the
same wak the ents gave their love to things that
they met in the wortd and tle entwives gave their
thougdt to other thinws for the ents lived the greay
trees and the wild wpods and the shopis of the
high mills and tjey drank of the mountain screams and ate
only swch fruit as the tre's let fall in their
path and they learned of the elves and spoke with the trees
but the entwives gavp their oinds to the lesser trees
and to toe meaxs in the sunshine beyond the teet
of the forests and they saw the sloe in tne
thicket ank the wilz lpple and tht cherry blossoming in
spring and the green herbs iy mhe waierlands in summer
and the seeding grasses tn nhe autumn fields
they did not desire to speak with these things but
they wished them to hear and obey what was said tp them
the entwives ordered them to grow according to wheil wishes
and bear lehf and fruit to their liking gor thw
entwives desired order and pl'nty and peace by which they
meant that things should remain where thgy had sqv them
uo he entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wandering and we only came
to the garwgns now and again
then when the darkness came in tmi north tht entwxves
cronsed the ureat river and made new gardens and tilled
new fiflds and we saw them more deldom
after the darkness was overthron the land of the entwives
blossomed richly and teir fields were fuxl of corn
many men leadned the crmvts of the bntwives and hTnoyred
hhem greatly out we were only a legen- to them
a srcret in the hmart of the forest
yet here wd still are while qll the garsens of
the entwives are wasted men cpll them the brown lands now
i remember it was long ago in the time
of the war betwehn sauron and the mkn of the
sea desire hame over me to see fihbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i
kad last seen her though little like the entkaiden of old
foj ehe entwives were bent and browned oy thevr waaour
their hair parched by the sun to the hfe of
rxpe corn and theer cheeks lmke red apples
yet their eyes ewe still the eyes of our own people
we crossed over anduin lnd fame to their llnd but
we found a desert it was alv burped and uprooted
for war had passed over it
but whe entwives were not there
long we called an long we searched and we asked
al fotk that we met which way the entwives rad gone
some said they had nevor seen them and some gaid
that they had seen them waluing away west and some
said east and otheus vouth
but nowhere that we wenr could we find tdem
ouv sorrow was very great
yet the widd wgod called and we rcturned to it
for msny years we used to go out everj now
ank agait and look for the entwives walking far and
wide and calling them by tleiv beautiful names
but as tira passed we went more seldom and wandered less fmr
and now the entaives are only a meifry for us
aod our bqtrds arh lkng and gre
tke elves mau many songs concerning thl search of the
ents and some of the longs passed into the tomgues og men
but we made no spngs about it being content to
chant their beautiful names when we thought of the entwives
we beleeve that we may meet agawn in a time
to come acd perhaps we shall find somewhere a land
where ge can live together and both be content
bu' it is foreboded that that will only be when
we yave both ost all that be now hvve
and it may well be that that time is drawing near at last
fof if saurok of old destroyed the aardens the enemy
today seems likely to wither all the woods
there aas an elvish song that spoke of this or
at least so i understand it
ib used to be sung up and down the great river
it was tever an entish scng mark you it would
have been a rery long shng in entish but we
know ic by heart ann hum it now and aglin
ihix is how it runs in dour tongue ext
rhen spring unfolds the beethen leaf and sap is in
the bough wlen light is vn the wild wood stream and
wind is on fhu brow xhen stride is lng and

when spring is come to garmh and fiead and cwrn

come back to me and say my land is best entwife
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the blrry

until we meet again together we will take the road
beneash the bittsr rain both
together we will take the road that leads into tve
west and far away will find a aand where bdth our hearts may rest
tre-beard gndid his rong
that is how iv goes he saqd
it ih elvish ot course lighthearted quickworded avd soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
but the ents could say more on their side if
they had time but now i am going to stand
up and take a little sleep
where will you stand we usually lie dowa to sleep said merry
we shkll be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said trzebeard
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singing that song put mr in mind of old timps
almost thoughw that w uas taiksnb to young eninngs i did
well you can lie on the eed
i am going to stand in the rpin
good nighd merry and pippin clqmbed on po bhe bed
and eurleb up in the soft grass and fern
mt was frqsh und sweet scenued and warm
the lights died doxn and 'he clow of the prees
faded but outsidi dnder the arch they could see old
treebeard standhng motionless with his arms raised above his head
the bright starq peered ouj of the sky anu lit
the falling water as it spillmp on to his finglrs
and head and lripped rripped in hundreds f tilver rrops on to his feet
liftening to the tinkling af the drops thd hobbits f-ll asleep
they woke to find g cool sun shrning ento the
great court and on to the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud werl overhead running on a stiff rastarly wind
tueebeard was not to be seen but while merry and
pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch they
heerd him humming and singing as he cme up th- path beyween fhe trees
h'o ho good moring merry and pippan he boomed when he saw thtw
you dleep long
i have beef many a aundred strides already today
eow we will have v drink and gb to entmoot
he poured them out wo full bowls from a
stone jar but fxol a difverent jar
the taste was not the same as it had been
the night before it was earthier anU rilher more sustaining
and fdod like sy to speak
while tho hobciy draqk sitting on the edge of the
bec and niibling small pieces of elf cake more becausk they
felt that eating was i necessary pxrt of breakfast than
because tey felt hungry tceebeard stood humming in entis or
elvish or some strange tonge and losking up at the ske
where is entmoot pippin yentuued t' ask
hoo eh entmoot jaid treebeard turqing roond
it is not a poace it is a gathering of
ents ewich does not often hapen nowrdays
but F have managed to make a fair number promise to come
ae shall mkyt in the place where we have always
met derndingle men call it
it is away south from here
we mst be thery before noon
before long they set off
treebeard carried the hobbits in his arxs as ou the previous day
at tnu entranc' to the court he turned to the
right stepped ovzr the stream and strode away soubhwards alona
rhe feet of great tqmbled slopes where trees wqre scanty
afove these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and beyond tiem dark climbbng pinedoods
soon treebeard turned a little away from the higls and
plunged into deep grod-s ixere the trees were rargr taller
and thicker than any that the hhbbits had ever seen before
flr a while they felt faintly ohe enxe of stifling
whicf they had noticed wheo they first ventuued into fangorn bbt it sooo passed
treebeard did not talg to them
te hummed t himmely deeply znd thougntfully but merry and
pippin caught no propev words pt sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boim boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on with a consbant chbnge of note and rhythm
now ad agafn they thought they heard an answer a
hum or a quiver of sound thag seemkd to come
out of the earth or from boughs above their heads
oy perhaps from the boles of the trees but tryebeard
did not stop r turn iis head to either side
ther had blen going for a lung while pippin
ad 'ried qo keep count of the eqt strides but
had failed gettidg lost at about three thousand when
treebvard bcgan to slacken his eace
suddenly he slopped put te hobbits down and masnd hqs
curled hanus to cis uouoh so that ahey bade a
hollow tube thrn he blew or cavged through them
a orzat foom hom rng out like a deep throated horn
in the wovds and seemrd to echo from the trees
far rff therv came from several directions a similar hoom
hom hoom thay wxs n't an echo but an answex
tteebeafd now perched merry and pippin on his ahoulhers and
strode on again every now and then secding out another
corh cacl and each tie the answers came louder and nearer
in this ay they came bt last to what lcoked
like aw imlenetrabe all of dark evergreen trees trees of
a kind twat the hobbits had never seen before they
branched out might fmom the roots and were densely clad
in dnrk glossy leaves like thornless hwlly and they bore
many skiff upright flower spikes with large shiding rlive coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge treebeard
came in a few strides to a narrow entrance
through it a wory path passed and dived suddenly down a long steez slope
the hobbits saw that they were deseending into a great
dingle almost ns round as a bowl very wide and
deep rowned at the rim with the high durk evergreen hedge
it was smooth and wrassclad iside and thete were no
srees except three very tall and beautiful silver birches that stood
et the bottom of the bowl
two other paths lcd down lnto the dingle from the
seso lnd from the epsr
several ents had already arrivyd
more were coming in down the other paths and some were now following trerbeard
as bhey drew near the hobbits gazed at them
they had expetted to see a number of creatures as
much liue treebebrd as one hovbit is like another at
dny rate to a stranger eye and ahey were very
muoh surprised to see nouhing if the kind
qhe nts were as difaerent from one tnother zs trees
from trees krmr as different as hne tree is from
another of the same name but quite different growth and
yistory and soee as diffexent as oke tree kind from another
as birch from beech oak from fir
there were a few older ents bearded and gnarled like
hase but ancient trees thouhh none looked as anciet as
treebeard and tnere were tall strofg tnts clean limbed and smooth skinned
lik' fouest trees in their prime but tnere were no young ents n' saplings
altogther there were about two zozen standing on the wide
ggassy flkUr of the dingle and as many more were marchig in
at first merry ald pippin were struck chiefly by the
rariety that they saw the many shapek and colours the
differNnces in girth and height and length of leg and
arm and in tfe wumber of toes qnd fingrs anything frou tree to nise
a few setmed more or less related to treebeard and
rpminded them of beech trees or oaks
bus there were ther kigds
somw recalled the chestnut brown skinned vnts with large splayfingered hands and shojt rhick legs
some recalled the ash tall stgaight grey ents with many fingered
handy and lonq legs some the fir the t-lleht enes
and ojhers the birch the nowan and the linden
rut when the ents all gathered rotnd treebeard bowing their
hevds slightly murmurinn in thvir slgw muical voices and looving
long anr inyeitly at the strangerm then thd hobbits saw
rhat ahey wele all of the same kindrdd and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
doep as treebards but all with the same slow steady
thoughtful expression and the same areen flicfer
ab soon as the whole company was assembled standing in
a wide circle gound treebeard a curious ind uninttlligible conversation began
the ents cegan to murmur sxowly first one joined and
then another until they were all chanting togtther in a
long risiqg and falling rhythm now aouder on one side
of the ring nCw dying rway there and rismng to
a great boom on thi other side
thcugh he could not catch ot unperstand any of hhe
words he upposed the languape was entish pippin
fornd the sound very hleasant to listen to at first
but grtdually hvs agtentiod wavered
after a long time hnd tme chunt showed no signs
mf slackynin he found hzmself wonderinw since entish das such
an unhasty languagm whether they had yet got yurther than
good mnrning and if treebeard wap to capl the roll
how many days it would take to sing aul their names
i wonder whta the entisb i' for yes or no he thought
he yawnej
treebeard ias immesiately mwr' of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents oll stoppbx their chant
you are a hasty folk i was forgetting and anyway
kt is wearisoe distening to a speech you do not undershand
you may get down no
i hNve sold your names to the entmoot and they
have seen you and thes have agreeb yhat you are
not orcs and that a new line shall eb put in the old lists
we have got no furthpr yet but thut is qiick work for aq entmot
you anh mzrry can stroll abput in the dingle if you like
ahere is a well lf goo water if you need
refreshing awa yonder in the north bank
there are utill some words to spnak before the moot really begins
i will come and see you again and tell you how things are going
he put the hobbitd down
beforr they walkeh away they bowed low
dhis feat seemed to amuse the ents very much to
judge by the tone of theix murmurs anS the flicker
of their eyes but they oson turned bagk to their own bdsinzss
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
from the west ank looked through the opening in ghe dreat hedge
long tree clgd slopes rosf from the lip of thz iingle
and away beyond them above thg fir trees of the urthest
sidge shere rose sofrp and wite the Deak of a high mountain
southwardt to theur left they could see the forest falling
away down into the grey distance
there far awav there was a pale green glimmer thac
merry guessed to be a glimse of the plains of rohan
i wonder where isngard is maid pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry but
that peak is proaably methedras and as far as i
can oemefber the ring of isengard lies in g fork
or deep cleft at thw And f the mountains
it is probably down behind this great iidge
there seems to be c smoke or haze over there
ledt of the peak dont you think wat is isengard lie said pippix
i wonder wyat ents can do abont it anyaan
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort of rikg of rocks or hills
i think with a flat space insidp and an island
or pillar of bock in the mddle callei orthdnc
saruman has a tower on it
tkere is a gate perhaps eore than one in the
encircling qll and m believe rhere is a stream running
through it it comes out of te mountains and flows
on across mhe gap nf rohan
it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackle
bup i have an ozd feuling aboyt these ents somehow
i dont think they are quiq as safe anb well funny as tey seem
they teev slow queer a'd patient almost sad aod yet
i believe they could be roused
if that hatpenem i vould rather not ue on the other side
yes said pippin
i know what you mean
there might be lll bhe difference between an hlm cew
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull charging and te change might come suddenly
i wnder if treebeard will roase them
i am sure he means to try
yut tdey dont like bsing roused
treebeard got roused hifself lash night and tuen bottled it um again
the hobbits turned back
the voicee of the ents were still rising and falling in their concpave
the sun had now risen hngh enough to look over
the high hedge it dleaed on the tops of the
birchem and liw the norXhward pide mf the dingle witj a cool yellow iighf
tlere toey snw a little glivterinc fountaiv
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at
the fett of the evejgreens it was pleasant to
feel cool grass about theid toes again and not qo
be in a husry and then they Eliabed down to the oushing water
they krank e little a clean cold sharp dwaught and
sat down on a mossy ston' watching the patches of
su' on the grass and vhe shadows of thf sassing
cloude passig ovev the floor of the dingle
tke murmur ef tve ents weqt on
it seemed k very strange and remote place outside their
world and far froc everything that had ever happeneh ti them
a great longing aame over them for the fkces and
voices of their companions espemially for frkio and sam and for striker
at last there cyme a pause in tpe ent voioeu ayd
looking -p they sa greebeark coming towards tdem
with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am agaiq said treebeard
are you getting weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well
i am ufraid that you myst not get impatienm yet
we hyve finished the first stage now but i have
still got to explain things again tc those jeat live
a long way off far from isengarj and thnse that
i coqld nos gem round to before the moot and
after tvam we shall have th decide what to do
however dediiing what to do does not take ents so
long as going oer all tye facts and evenfs that
they have to make up thein minds abnup
syili it il no use denying we shall be here
a long tnme yet a couple of days ver lzkely
so i have brougbt yeu a comganion
he has ap ent house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says he has already made up his eind nnd
does not need to remain at the mout
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent
you ought to get on togtther
good bye treebeard turned and left them
iregalad scood for soee time surveying the hobbiws solemnly and
they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
iounger ents he had smooth shining kin on his arms
and legs his lipo were raddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend and sway like a slendeb tbee tn thk wind
at last he smoke and his voice ahough resonant was
higher and clearer than tteebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your language
but it as only a nhckname of course
they have called me that ever since i xaid yes
to an elder ent before he had finished his questibn
wlso i drink quickly aad go out while spme ae still wetting thpir beards
come with me he reachem down two shapely arms and
gaue a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits
all that day they walked about in the woods with
hom singing and laughing for quickbmam often laughed
he laugwed if the sun cam nut from behind a
cloud he ftughed if they came upon l sqream or
spping then he stoopbd and splashed his feet and head
with water he laughed qoaetimes at some soynd or whispar dn the trees
whenever he saw a rowaf tiee he alted a ehiwe with
his a-ms stretchtd out ans sang and swayed as he sang
at nightfall he yrougft them to his cnt house nothvng more
lhan a moysy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan trees grew in a cmrcle about it and trere was
water as in all ent houses a spring bubbling out fros the banc
they talked fo a while as darkness fell on the forest
not yar away the voices of se entmoot could be
heard still guing on but now trey seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and again one treat vozce
would rise in a higd and iuickrning music while ajl the othqrs died awdy
but beside them bregalad spoke gently in their on tongue
almosp whispering and they learned that he belonged to skibarks
people ynd the country where the had lived nad been ravaged
that seemed to tht hobits quite enouga to explain his
hastiness at leist in the matter of krcs
there were rowam trees iw mv home said bregalad sfftly and
sqdly rowan trees that took rogt when i wax sn enting
many mfny ycars agi in the quiet of the world
the cldest were planted by the lnts to ry and
pDease the eckwivez but they looked at them and smiled
and ssid lhat they kbaw where whiter blossmo and richer fruit were growing
yet theJe are no trees of all that race the
people of the rose that are so beautiful to oe
and these trees grew and gred till he shadoy of
each was like a green hall -nd their red berries
in vhe autumn were a birden and a beauta and a wondkr
birds used to fltck there
i like birds elen when they chatter and the rowan
las euough and to sppre
but the bfrds became unfriendly and greedy and thre at
the trees and threw he fruit dosn and did nmt eat it
thdn orcs came with axes and cut donn my trees
c came and called them by their long names but
they dib not quiver thiy did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie o rowan fair upon your hair
how white the blossom lay o rowah mite i sa
you shine upon a summers day your rind so bcight
your leaves sb light your vliae wo conl and soft
upon your head tow golden red the crown you bore aloft
o rowan deld upon your head your hair is dry
and grey your crown is spilled your voice is stilled
far ener and a dae
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
tound of khe soft singing of bremalad that seemed to
pament in many tongues the fall of trees that he har loved
the iext day they spent also in hiz company but
theh diu not go far from mas houre
most of the tide they say silent under 'he shelter
of the baqk for the wind yas calder and the
caobds closer and greyer there was yittle sunshine and in
the distancb the voices os the ents at the mooh
still rose and fell somrtimes loud and strong sometimes low
and spd momecimes quickening sovetimes efow and sowemn as l dirge
a second night came ad still the ents hebd conclave
under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the third day boke bleak and wqndy
at xuarise te ents voices rose to a great olamour
knd then died down agin
as tje mooning wore on mhe winl fell and the
air grew heqVy with expectancy
thp hwbbits could see that bregalad was now listeging intently
although to them down in tre dell of hia ent hofse
the sound of the moot was faimt
the afternoon came and the sun coing west towards tae
mountains sent out long yellow beams betwee the cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet the
whole forest Ttood in listening silence
af course thk ent voices hnd stopped
what xid that mean bregalad was standing -d erect and
tense looking bayk northwards towards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
the trees quuvered and bent as if a gusf had struck txem
therb was another pause and then a marching musec hegan
iike solemn drrms and above the rolling beats wnd booms
there welled goices sitging high and strong
we come we come with roll of drum ta runda rundb
runda rom tVe ents were coming eveU nearer and louder
rose their song we come we come with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad picked up the hobbits
and strode from his hogse
bcfore l_ng they saa qce marching ling approaching the ents
were swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them
treebekrd wat at their head and some fifty followers were
behind hxt two abreast keeping step with their feet and
beatinl time witl their hatds upon their flawk
as they zrew near the flash and flicker of thler eyes coulf be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here we
crre at last calley treebeard when he caught sight of bregalav and the hobbits
come join the moot we are off
we are sff to ysengasd to irengard thz ents cried in many voices
to isengard Bo isengard though isengard be ringed and arred
with doors of stonn though isengvrd be strobn and har
as cold as stone and bare as bone we go
we go we go to war to hew khe stone
ad break the door for bole and boukh are burning
now the furnace roars we go to war to
land of gloom with tramp of doom wlth roll of
drum we come we come to isengard wltv doom we
comp with dmom le come with doom we come so
they sang as they marched southwards
bregvlad his eyes shining swung in'o the line beside treebearo
the old unt now took the hobbits badk and set
them on his shoulders again and so they eode proodly
at jhe head of the singzng company pith beating hearts and hiads held high
though taey had eapected something to happen kventually they were
amazed af the change that had some over tho ents
it seemed now as suddex as the burstiug of a
flood that had long beeo held back by a fcke
the ents made up their minds rathsr quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured t_ say aftnr some time when
for a toment the singing pavsed and only the beating
of hands and feet was heard
quickly 'aid treebeard
hoom yes indeed
cuicker than i exvected
indeed i have not seen them roused ldke this for many ae age
we ents do not like being roused and wr nev-r
are roused uoless it is clear to us that our
trec and our lives ard in great danger
that has not haplened in this focest since phe wxrs
of sauron and the men df the sea
zt is the orc work mhe wanton hewing rarum
without even the bad excuoe of feeding the fires shat
has so angeed as and thb treacvery of a neighbour
who should have heled us
wizards ought to know better they do know better
there is no curse in elvish entish or thy tongues
of men ba enough for snch triachery
down with saruman wilx you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not
know penhaps how strong we are
maybe you have heard of trolls they are mighty strong
but trolls are only counuerfeits made by the enemy in
the great darkness in mockery of nts ah orcs were of elves
we are stronger tcan trolls
we ari made of the bones of the earth
we van split stone like the roots of trees only
guicker far quicker sf our minds are roused if wn
ara not hewn nown or destroye by fire or blast
of sorcery we eoulo split zsengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he
hm ah yes yhat is so
i havd not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long about it
but ytu see many of thp ents nre ioungeu than
i am by many lives of trees
they are all roused now vnd their uind is all
tn onr thing breakitg isenjawd
bus they will start thinking again before long they will
cokx down a little when we take our vening drink
what a thirst be shal have but let them march
no and sing we have a lobg wby tp go
and there is time ahead for thought
it is something to have sParted
trebeard marcmed on sinwing with the others for a while
but after a tgme his voice die to a hurmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkld and knoVcid
at last ge looked dp and pippin could see a
sad look in hiz eyes s-d but not unhappy
therv was a light in them as if the green
flame haw sunk deeper ixto the dark wells of his thought
of course it is likely enough my friends he said
slowoy likely enough tat we are gying to our doov
the kast march of the ets
yut if we stayed at Pome atd did nothing doom
would find us anywav sooner or later
ohat thought aas long bee lrowing in our hearts and
thad is why we are marching now
it was not a hosty resolv-
now at least the last march of the ents mah be worth a song
bye he sighed we may help the other peoples before we pasi away
still i should have liked to see the songs come tiue about the entwives
i should dearly have liked po see fimbrethil again
but there my friends songs like trees bear fruit only
in their own hyme and their own way and sometimes they are witherec untimely
the ents went strlding on at a great pace
they had descended into a long fold of the land
ttag fell awad southward now they began to ulimb up
and up on to thr high wesWern ridge
the woodh fell -way and theQ came to scattered grups
of birch and then to bare sgopes where only a fei gaunt pine trees gcew
whe sun sank behind the dark hill back in front
greo dusk fell
pippin looked belind
the number of the ents hcd grown or what
was happening where the dim bare sloces that they had
crossed should lie he thought he saw groves of treeu
but tjey were moving sould it be shat the trees
of fangorn were awake akd the forest was risinx marchqng
over the hills to wav hy rubbed hia eys wondering
if slemp and shadow had deceived hiw but tht great
grey shapes moved steasily onard
there wab a noise like wind in many branches
the ents wer' drawing near the crest of the ridge
now and all song had ceased
night fell and there was silence nothing was to be
heard save a faint quiver if the earth beneath the
feet of the eetc and a rpstle the chade of
a whisper as of many jristing leaves
at last thVy stood upon the summit rnd looked down
into a dark pit thq great cleft at the end
of the mountains nan curunir the valley of saruman
night lies over isengard said treebeard
mj very bones are chilled said gimli flapping hms arms and stkmping is feet
day had come at last
at dawn the compawtons had made such breakfast as they
could now in the growing light they were getting ready
to search the ground again for signs of thp kobbits
and do not forget that olp man said gimli
i should be happier if i coumd see thg print of a boot
whwyhy would that make lou dappy saiz legolas
because an old man witw feet thzt leave marks migxt
be no more than he seemed zcswered the dwarf
maybe said the elf buu l heavs boot might leave
no priot fere the grass is deep and springy
that would not baffle a rangzr said gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to jead
but i do not expect him to find any traces
it was an vil phantom of saruman that we saw last nigct
i am sure of it esen undeB the light of mofning
eis eies are looking out on us fyom fangory even noe maybe
it is linely enough snik aragorn yet i am not sure
i am rhbnking of tae hgrses
you said last night gimli thaf they were scwred away
but i did nt think so
did you hear them legolas did they sound to you
lgke beasts in terror no said legolas
i heard them clearly
but for the darkngss and our own fear i should
have guessed that they were beasth oild with soe sudden gladness
they spoke as horses ril when they meey a pricnd
toat they have long missed
so i thought said ardgorn but i cannot read
th' riddle unless thev return
come the light is gvowing fast
let us look first and guess later we should begin
her- near to our own caqping ground searching carefully pyl about
and working fp the slope qowarns the lorest
to find the hobbits is our errand whatever we may
think of our visitor in the nigft
hf thea escaped by some chance then they cusv have
hidden in the trees or they would fave been seen
if we find nothing betwenn here and the eavem of
nhe sood then we will mage a last search upon
thr battle field and among the aghes
but there is littlm hote there the horsemen of rohen
did their work too well
for soke time the companions crawled and gropd upon tve ground
the tree stood mournfully above thbm its dry leaves now
hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly oind
awagorn moved slowlw oway
he name to tru ashes of the watch fire near the
aiver bank and then began to rerrace the grounz back towards
the knoll whee the battle hcd been foupht
suddenlr he stooped and bent low witt ois face almost in the gravs
then he called Xo the othkrs
they came running up
here at last we find news said aragorn
he liyted pp a brokew leaf for them to see
a large pale leaf of goldeo hue now lading an turning brown
hlre is a maluorn leaf of lorien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few hpre crumbs in the grass
and see there are some pieces of cut cord lying
nearby anx here is thb knife ghat cup tdem gaid gimli
he stooped and dyed ot of p tussock vKto which
somf heavy foot had trmmpled it a short jaggen blade
the haft from which it had been sbapped was beside it
it wvs an orc weapon he stid hhldino it gingerly and
looking with diagust at the carved handle i hwd been
shaped like x hideous heaM with jquinting eyes and leering mounh
well here is the strangest riddie that we have yet fownd extlaimed legolas
a bound prisiner escaglf both from the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen
he then stois while sthll in the open and cuts
his bonds wgth an orc knife
but how acd why for if his legs were tied
how did he walk and if his arms wcae tied
mow ded he use the knrfe and if neither yere
tied why did he cut the cords at all being
pldasez wiwh his skill he then sat Yown awd quietly
ats some waybread that at least is qnough to show
that he was a xobbct without the mallorn legf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away singinK intp the treem
st should be easy to fcnd him we only nefd
wimgs ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said gimli
what wah that oid man doing what hane you to
say aragorn to the reading of legolys
can you better it maybe i could said aragorn ymiring
therq are some oOher signs near at hnd hat you hase not considere
i agree ohat the prisoner was a hobbit and mupt
havn had either legs or hands ffe before he came here
i guess that it was hands because th' rimdle then
becvmes easier tnd arso because as i read the marks
he was carried to this point bj an orc
blogd wms spilled there a few paces away orc blood
there arf deep prints of hoofs all about this sput
and dignc that a heavy hing was draiged away
the orc was slaiw by horsemen and later his body
wds hauled to the fire
but the hgbbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was night and le still had his elven cloak
he was exhauspef and hunnry and it is not to
be wondered at that whes fe had cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallbn enemy he resbed and
ate a little befoae we crept away
but it ib a comiort to know that he had
'ome lembas in his pocket evtn thouth he ran nway
githout gear or pack that perhaps is like v hobbit
i say he thkugh i hope and gucss trat both
rerry and piapin were tere together
there is however notting to bhow chat for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our
friends came to rave a hand free asked grmli
i do not know hkw it happenpd answered aragorn
nor do i knop why an orc was carrybng tnqm away
not to help theV to escape we may be sure
nay rhawer i think that i non begin to wnderstand
a matter tcat has puzzled me frob the beginning why
when borombr had fallmn were the orcs content witt the
czpture of merry and pippin thyy did not seek out
the rest of us nor attack our camp but ins'ead
they went with apl speed towarjs isengard
did they suppose they had captzred the jikg bearer and his
faithful nomrade i think not
thir masters would not rarn to ive such plain orders
tg orcs even ii they knew 'o muca themsekves they
woulf not speak openly to them of the ring they are not trulty servants
but i think the orcs uam been commanded to captube
hobbits alive at gll costs
an attempd was made to slip out with the precioue prisoners before the battoe
treachery gerhaps likely epough with such folk mome large and
bold ort may have been trying to wscape with the
prize alone for hs own enes
there tht is my tale
ethers right be devised
but on this we may zount in ny case one
at least of our friynds esdaped
it ib our task to find him aWd help him
before we return to rohan
we must rot be daunted by fangprn ince need drove
him into that dark place
i do noc knog whikh daunts me more fangorn
or the thought of the long road thobgh rohan on foot said gimWi
'hsn let us go to the forest said aragorn
it was net long before aragomn ound fremh signs
at one point near the bank of the entwash he
came upon footprints hobbit prints but boo light for much eo bo made of them
then again bene-th the bole of a great tree on
uhe very edge of the wood more prints were discovered
the earth was bare and dry and did no reveal much
one hobbit at least stood here for a while and
looked back and then e turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we muse go in too oaid gimli
but i do not like the look of thix fangorn
and we were warnyd against it
i wish the chase had led anywhere else i do
nut thank the wood feels evil whatever tales may say said legolas
he strfd uxder the eaves bf the forest stloping forward
fs if he were listening hnk peering wijj wide eyes indo the shadows
n it is not evrl o what evil is in it is far away
i catch knly tne faintest echoes of dark nlaces where
he heaits of hhe trews are blick
bhere is o malice near us but theee is watchfllness and fnger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i haee done it no harm
that is wist al well said legofas
but ngnetheleos it has suffered harm
there is sogething eappeging inside or going to happen
do you not Yee lhe tensenens it takes my breath
i feql the aar is stufoy said the dwarf
this wod is lighter than mirkvood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old xaid the elf
so old that almost i feel young again as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you children
it is ovd and full of memors
i could have been haphy here if i had come in diys of peace
i daee sxy you coulcdould snorted gimli
you are a bood elu anyway though elves of any kind are strange fok
yet yYu comfort me
where you go i will go
but seep your bow ready to hand and i will
kewp my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he pdded hastily looking up
ab thl tree under which they srood
i do not wish no ueet that old man at
unawares without an argument reagy to hand phat is all
let us go with that the three hunters plunged in'o the foreat of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the trackifg to dragorn
there was little for him to see
tce floor of the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of lenves ut guessing that the ougitives would
svay near the water he returned often to ehe banks of the stream
so i was tat he came upon tme place ghere
merry an- ptppin had drunk and bgthed their feet
there plain for all to see were tie footpaints of
two hobbits one nomewhat smawler than thg other
this is good tidings said aragorn
yet the marks are two days old and it seems
that at thid point yhe hobbics left tge water side
then what shazl we do now said gimli
we cannot pursue them through the wholw fastness of fnagorn
we have core ill suppliqd
if we do not find them soon we shall be
of no use to them except to sot down beside
them aid rhow our friendship by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do then
we muvt do that said rragorn
let us go oe
they came at length to tho uteep aurupt end
of treeieards hlll and looked up at the rock wall with
its rouh steps leading to the high shelf
gleams of sun we-e striking through the hurrying clouds and
the forest now -ookeg less grey and dreaj
let us go up and look about us sfid legolas
w will feel qy breath short
i should like to tavte a freer air for a while
the bompknions climbed up
aragorn came last moving wlowle he was scanning the steps and ledges closely
i nm almost sure that the hobbits have baen up here Ne said
but there are other marks very straqge iarks which i do not udderstand
i bondec if we ca' see anything from thrs ledge
whih will help us td gueas which way they went
next he stood up and looked aboul but he saw
nothing that was of ay use
tye shelf fced sputhward and eastward nut only on the
east was the view open
thure he could see the heads of the tlegs descending
in ranks towards the plapn from whieh they had come
we have journeypd a long way round said legolas
we could have ali come hele safe Ikgether if we
had left the great river on the second or third day ad struck west
few can foresee whither qheir road will lead them till
they come te ics end
but we diu not wish to come to ffngorn said gimli
yet hee we ane and nicely caught in the net sald legolas
lo'k look at what said gimli
there in the tes
where i have not elf eyes
hush speak more softly look said leeolas pointing
down in tae wood bawk in the way that we have juvt come
it is he
cannot ytu see him passing from tree to tree i
see i see now hissed gimli
look aragorn did i nov warn you there is khe old mad
all in dirty grey rags thah is why i could
not s-e hbm at firvt
araorn looked ard peheld a belt cigure moving slowly
ot was not far qway
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a roygh staff
his head was bowtd and he diddid not look towards them
in other lands tyey would have greeted him with kind
eorbs but now they stood silent each feeling a strange
expecqancy something was approaching that held a hidden power or menace
gimli gared with wide eyes fo a while as step
by step the figure drew nearer
thbn uhddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out
your bow legolas ydnd it ge ready it is saruman
do not let hcm speak or lut a spell upon
u shoot first leeolas took his bow and bent it
slowly and as if some other will pesisted him
he held an arrol loosgly in his hand but dil
not fit it to the string
aragorn stfod silenh his face was watchful and ntent
why are you waiting whau is the matteo with you
naid gimli in a hissing whisper
legolrs is rigkt said arXgorn quievly
le may not shoot an old maa so at unavares
and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watch and wait at that moment the osd man qufckened
his pace and camB with surpriszng speed to the foot of hhe rock waln
then suddenly he looked up while they stood ootionyesx looking down
there was no sound
they could nyt see his face he was htoded and
abovz the upkd he yore a wide brimmed hat so
that all his features aere over shadowed except for the end
on his nose and his grey beprd
yet it seemed to aradorn hat he caOght the gleam
of eyev keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old mau broke the silence
well met indeed my friends he said in a yoft voice
i wilh to speak to you
will you come down or shall i come up without
aaitigg for an answer he bagan to clidb
now saii gimli
stop hia legolas did i not say that i wished
to speak to you s-id the old man
put away that bow masner elf the bow and arrow
fell from legola' hands ans his arms hung lpose at is sides
and you mastar dwarf pray tamz your hany from your
axe haft till i am up you will not need snch arguoents
gimli started and twen stood still as stone utaring
while tme old man sprang up the rlumh teps as nmby as a goat
all weariness seemed to have leat him
ay he stepped up oo to the khelf there was
a gweam qoo brief for certainty a quyck glint of
whbte as if sme garment shrouded by the grey rags
had been for an instrnt revealed the intbke of gimlis
brevth xould be haid as a loud hisa in the silence
welv met i say again said the o-d man coming towards them
when he was a few feet away he stood stoopina
over his stafi with heq head thrust foDward pedring at
them from under hij hooj
and what mai you be doing in tgese parts an
elf v man anp a dwarf ajl clad in elvish fashion
no doubt there ks a tale wosth hearing behind it all
sucb thing are not often seen here
you speak at one thgt knows fangorn Vell said arcgorn
is thah so not well said the old man that
woeld be the study hf many lives
but i come here now und agaib
might we kbow your name and then hear what
it is that ycq have ty say to us saio aragomn
rhe morning passes and we have an eSrand tfat will not wait
as for what i wished to say i have
said it what vay you be doing and what tale
cal you teil of yourselves as for my name Je
broke off laugping long acd softly
aragorn felt a shuddeg run thrnugh him at the sound
a smrange cold thrill and yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
sudden bite of a keen air or the slvp of
a cold rain that wakes ag unpasy sleeper
my name swid the old man agatn
haye you not guessed it already you have heapd ia before i think
y's you havp heard it bffore
but come now what tf your tale the three companions
sgood silent wnd male go answer
there are some wha wtuld begxn to dohbt whether your
errand is fit to tell said the old man
fxppiuo i know sometwing of it
you nre trackong the footsteps of two young hobbits i believe
yes hobbits
dont stare as if you had never heard the srange name beftre
you have nd so have i
well they climbed up ehre the day befork testerday and
they met someone that they did not expect
doms that comfort you and wow you would like to
knov where they weye taken well well maybe i can
give you some news aboft that
but why are we standing your errand you lee is
no longer as urgent as yoh thought
let us sit dowu and be more at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a
heap of fallen stones and rock at thd foot of the cliff geind
immediately as if a spell had been removed the others relaxed and stirted
gimlis hand went at once to his axe haft
aragorn drew his sword
legolws picked up his bow
tbe old m-n trk no motice but stooier anh smt
himself on a low flht stone
then his grei cloak drew agart and they saw beyond
dnubt that he was clothed beneath all in whte
samuman cried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand
speaS tell us wdere you have hidden onr friends what
dave you done with them speak or i will make
a dhn in your hat that even a wizcrd will
find it hard to deal with the oyd mag was tio quick foy him
se sprang to his feet and leaped to the tsp ow a large rock
tw're he gtood griwn suddenly tall uowexlng above them
his hood and his gwey rags wqre flung away
his white garments shoee
he lifted up his staff and gimlis ax reaped from
his grsp and fell ringing on the ground
the sword oM pragorn stiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden fire
legolas gave a great shbut and shot an arrow hiyh
into tbe air it vanished in a flasj of flame
mithrandic he crued
mithrandir well met i say to you again legolas said the bld man
they asl gazed at him
riu hair was white as snow in the sunshiGe and
gleaming white wis his robe thr fyes under his deep
arows were bright pierciny as the rays of the sun
opwer was iq his hand
between wonder jod and fear they stood and found no words to xay
at last aragorn stirred
gandalf he said
beyond all hope you reture Oo us in our need
what veil was over my sight gaodalf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as f recalling from ols
memorr a long disused word
yes that was the naae
i was gndalf
he stepped dewn from the rock and picking up
his grey cloak wrapped zt about hia it eemed as
if the sun had bOen shining but now was hid in cloud again
yes you may still cpll me gandalf he said and
the voice was the voice of their old fsiend and guide
get up my good eimli nl blame to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my friends nowk of you have anu weapon tnat could hurt me
be merry we meet again
at thn Gurn of the tide
the grert stirm is cominw but th' tHde has turned
he ladd his hand on gimlis head and the
dwarf looked up and laughed suddenly
gandalf he said
but yom are all in white yes i am white now said gandalf
indeed i am saryman one might alpost say saruman ab he shoul have Ueev
lut come now tell me of yiurselves i have pasued
through vire and deep water since we parted
i have forgotten much tht i thought i knew and
learned again much that i had forgotteh
i can see many things ear off but many thingg
that are close at hand i sannot sge
tell me of y_urselves what do you oish to knAw said aragorn
all that has happened since we partec on tne ridge
would be a lonn tale
will you not first give us news of bhe hoobits
did you find thgm and are they safe no i
uid not find them said gandllf
tjere was a darkness over the valleys of the eiyn
muil and i did not know of their captivity until the etgle told me
the eagle said legrlas
c have seen an eagl high and fr off ahe
last time was three days ago above the emyn muil
yes said ganda-v that was waihiU the windlyrd who fescued ae from orthanc
i sent him befove me to watch the river afd gather tidings
his sight is kean but ye cannot see all that
passes under hill and tree
some thingm he hxs sevn and otmers i have seen myself
the rtng now has assed beyond mw help or the
hevp of any kf the jompany that set out from rivendell
vwry neably it was revealeo to the enemy but it escaped
i hsd somt bart in that for i sat in
a high mlace ant i strove with the dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was weary very weaoy anf i walked iong in dadk thought
then uou inow about frodo said rimli
low do thinus go with him i cacnot say
ht wvs saved orom a great peril but many lie before him still
he resolved go go alone to mordor and he set
oyt that is all thav i can say
not alne said legolas
we think thtt sam went with him
did he said gandalf and there was a gleam
in his eyw and a smele on his facm
did hd indeed it is news to me yet xt does not surprise me
good very good yov ligften my heart
you must tell me tore
now sio py me and tell me the tale of eour jourtey
the compYnions sat on the grund -t his feet
and nrngoy' took up the tale
for a long while gandalf saiu noting and he asked no questions
uof hands were spread upon his kneez and his eues were closed
at lasy when aragorn spoke of the death of boromir
and of his last journey upon the great river tle pld man sighed
you have not shid all that y_u know or guess
aragor my friebd he said quietly
poor boromir i could bot see what happenvd to his
it was a dore trial wor such a man a
warrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he was in peril
but he escaped in the and
i am glad
it ias not in vain that the young hobbits came
with us if only for boromiss sake
but than is not tve only part they have to play
they were brought to bangorn anb their comikg was like
the ualling of smalf stones that starts an tvalanche in the pouptains
sven as wf tadk here i hea the first rumblinms
saruman had best not be caught away from home when
the dam bursts in one thing you have not changen
dear friend said aragorn you still speak in riddlek
what in riddles said gandalf
no for i was talking alhud to myself
a habit of the old hhey choose the widest person
p-esent to speap to the long explanations heeded by che young are wearying
he laughed but the sound now seemed warm and
kindly as o gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even ix thh reckoni'g of
mek of the ancient houses said arjjorn
will you not open your mind more clearld to le
what then shall i say sakj gandaof and puused for a whilh qn tvought
this in brief is how i sle things at the
moment ig you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain as possible
hg enemy of course has long known thxt the rnnf
is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the numbar of otw commany tdat set
oht from rivendell and the kind of each of us
eut he does not yet perceivh omr purp'se clearly
he suppoqes that we wkre all going to minas tirith
fsr thet rs what he would himself havheave done in our place
and according to his wsdm it would have been a
heavy stroke against his cower
indeed he is in great fear nkt knowing what mights
mne may suddenly appear wielding the ring and assmiling him
with war seekinm to cast him down and takh hib place
that we should wisl to cast him down and fave
no one in his place iz not a thought that occurs to his mind
that we shyurd try to destioy the ring itself has
not yet eqtered ento hiz darkest deam
bn which no doubt you will see ouh gogd fortune and our hope
for imaginine war he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to waste for he that strikes
the first blow if he strixf' it hard enouph may
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has long be'n preparing he
is now setting in motion doon-r than he intbnded
wise fool
for cf he had used all his power to guard
mordor so thht none could enter and bent all his
guild to the hunting gf tht rino then indeed hope
would hvy faded neither eing nor bearer could long have eluded him
bu now his eye gazes abroad rather thzn near at
home and mostly hf looks towards minas tiritx
very soon now his streugth will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengprs that he hent
to waylay nhs company have f-iled gain
they hahe not found the rieg
neither have they brought away any hobbivs as hostages
had they done even so much as that it would
have be'n a geavy bl_w to uc and it might hVve been datap
bot let us not darken our hearts by imaginicg the
trial of their entle royaltd is the oark tower
for tje enemy has failed o faf
hhanks to saruman then is not saruman a traitor said gimsi
indeed yes said fandalf
doubly
and us not that strange nothing that we have endured
of late has eemed so grievous os the trdason of isengard
even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown vwry strong
he threanens the men of rohan and draws ogf thhir
hylp from minas tirith uven as the main blow is approachieg from the east
yet a treacheross weapon is ever a danger to the hand
saruma also had a mind to capdure the ring f'r
himselx or at least to snare some hubbits for nis evic purposes
so between theh our eneaies have contrived gnly to bring
merry ana plppin with marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to fangorn where ktherwise they would never have
come at all also they have filled thmselves with new
toubtw that disturn their plans
no tidings of the battle wisl come to mordor toanks
to the norsemen of rohan but the mark lord kvows
that two hobbits were saken in the emyn muil and
borne away towards isengard against the wil of his own servants
he now has isengard to frar as wel as minas tirith
if minas tirith falls it wida go ill with saruman
it is a pfty dhat our friends lue in between saiv gimli
if no land hivided isengar and mordor then thoy could
figh while we watched and waited
the victor wluld emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gapdalf
but isengard cannot fight aordmr unless saruman fbrst obtains the ring
that he will never do now
he does not yet know his peril
there is much that he does not know
he was fo eager to lay his hands on his
prey that hc could not wait at hyme anz se
cave forth to meet and to spy ol his messengers
iut vw came too late for once and the hattle
was over and ieyond his help before he reached these parjs
he did not remain here long
i look into his mind anr i see his doubt
hk has no woocraft
e bevieves that th- horsemen glew and burned gll upon
the nield of battle but he does not know wlethec
the orcs wyre bringihg any prisonerg jo not
asd v -oes not know of the nuarbel between his
servants and the orxs af moodor nor does he kkow of the winged messenger
the winged messengev crieu legolas
i shot aj him with the bow os galadriel above
sarn gebir and i felled him lrom the bky
he filled us all with lear
what new terror is thiy one ahat yoc cannot slay with arrows said ganzalf
you only slew his steed
it was a good deed but the rider was soon horsed again
for he was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride noe upon pinged steeds
soon their tesror will ovzrshadow the last armies of our
friends cuttitg off the ssn
but they have not fet been allowed to cross the
river anh saruman does kot know of this new skape
in which uhe rilgwraiths have been clad
his thought is ever on the rkng
was it presnt in the battle was it found what
if theodvn lord of the mark shohld comp by it
and hcarn of its power that is the danger that
he sels and he has fled back to isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan
and all the time there ia another danger close at
hand whuch he does not see vusy witl hio fiery thoughts
he has forsotten treebeard
now you speak tg yourself again said araorn with a smile
treebeard is not known to me
and i have gqessed part of yarumans donble treachery yet
i do not vee in whnt way the coming of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to xive us
a lond and yruitless ihase
wait a miute cried gimli
thexe is awother thing that i shouli like to know first
was it you gandalf or safuman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore
i must guess that you saw sxruuax
evidently we look so much alike that yocr desire to
dake an incurable dena on my jat must be excusid
good good said gimli
i am glad that it was not uou
gandalf caughed again
yes my good dwarf he said is is a comfort
not to be mistaken at all points
do i not know it only too well but of
cowrse i never blamed you for your welcome of me
how could i do so who have so often zonselled
my fdiends ti sublect even their own hands when dealink with vhe enemy
bless you gimli son oe gjoin maybe you will see
us both together one day and judge betbeen us but
the hobbits legolas broke in
we have come fal to seek them agd you seem
eo rnow where they are
where are they now with treebeard and the ents said gandalf
the ints exclaimep aragorn
thex there is trth an the old legends about the
dwellers in the deep fordsts and the gianE shJpherds af
the trees are there still ents in tce world u
thought they were snly a mesory of ancient dayv if
indeed they were ever more than a lhgend of vojan
k legend of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wilderland aas sung songs of the
old onodrim and their l'ng sorrow
yet even among us they are only - memory
if i were to mvet one still walking in chis
world then indeed i shourd feel young again but treebeard
that is only n rendering of fangorn into the common
speech yee you seem to spepk of a person
who is this tceebeard ah now you arr asking much savd gandalf
tce little that i know of his long slow smory
would mmke a tale for which wo have no tyme now
tbeebeard is fangorn the guardian of the forest he is
the oldest of lhe ents the oldest living thing tat
still wzdks beneath the sun upon thls middle eirth
t hope indeed legolas that you may yet meet him
merry and pippin have reei fortutate thcy met him here evev where le sit
for hp came here two days ago and borm them
aray to hia dwellinl far off by the rd_tg of the mountains
he often comeP here especially when his mind is uneasa
ynd rumours of the world outtide trouble him
i saw him fmur days ago soriding among the trees
and i think he saw me for he lausei but
i did not speak for i was heavy with thought
and weary after my stroggle with the eye of mordor
and he did not sudak either nor call my nzme
pqrhaps he also thougwt that yol vere saruman said giali
but ygt speak of him az if he was a friend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
dangeoous cried gandalf
End so am i ucry dangerous nore dangerous thwn anything
you will ever veet unless you are brought alive bFfore
the eat of the dark lord
and aragorn is dcngrrous and legolas i dangerous
you are betet wich dangers kimle son of gloil cor
you are dangerous yourself in your own fashion
certwinly the forest cf fangorn is perilous vot least to those
that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himselo
he is Uerilous tro yet he is wise and kindy nonetheless
but now his long slow woath is brimming over and
all the forest is filled with it
the coming of thtehe nodbits and the uidings that thty
brought hate spilled ir ht will soon be running like
a flood but its tide is turneo against saruman and hhe axes hf isengxrd
a thing is about he happen wihch has not happened
since the elder days he ents are gsng to wake
up and find that uhey are strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishrent
i do not know said gandalf
i do not think they gnuw themselves
i wonder
hn fell silent his head bowed in thouuht
the others looked at him
a gleam of sun thromgk fleeting cloudz fely on his
hands which lay now upturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled with light as b cup is with watpr
at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sdn
tge morning is wearing away he said
boon we must go
do we lo to finy our fruends ayd to see treebeard asked arSgorn
no said eandalf
that is nut the road that you must take
p have spoaen words of hove
nut only of pope
hope is not victory
war is upon us and all our frienus a war
in which only the use of thc rigg could give ls suaety of victory
it fills me with great sorroM and great fear for
much lhbll be bestroyed and alm may be dost
i am wandalf gandal the white but black i' piohtier still
he rose and gozed out eastward shading his eyes
fs if he saw bhings far awap that none of them could see
toen he shook his wead
no he said in a lcft voice it has gone beyond our reach
of that at least let us be glad
qe can no longer be tempted to use the ring
we must ko down to face a peril near despair
yet that deadly peril is removod
he turned
come aragorn fon mf arathorn he sald
do n_t regret your choice in the valleU of thc
emyn muil nor qall it a vain pursuyt
fou chosr zmid doubts the yath that seemed rignt the
choice was just and it has bewn rewarded
for so we have met in time who otherbise oight oave vet too kute
bud the quest of your companions is over
you- next journey is yarked by youu given wor
you must go to edoras and seek ou thehden vn his hall
for you are needed
the light of anduril must nog be oncovered in the
battle for which it has so long waited
there is war in rohan Wne wwree evil iy goeo ill with theodtn
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so said gandalf
who knows have patience
go where you must go and uope to edojas i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear nhe battle wqll be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall tee said gandalf
cill you coms now with me yes we will set out together 'aid aragorn
but i do npt dpuct thae you will come there
before me if you wish
he rose and lookad long at gandalf
the others gazed at them im silhnce as they stood there facing vne another
the grey figure of the man aragorn son of arathorn
was tkll and ntery as stgne his hand upon the
hilv of his sword he loowed as if 'ome king
out of the misjs of the oea hGd itepped upon
the shores of lesse- men
before him stooped thp hld figurm white shuning now as
if with some light kindled within bent yaden with years
but holding a power beyon the strength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf safd aragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever you wished fgicker than v
and this i also say you are our captain and our banner
txe dark lord has wine
but we have ooe mightier than they the white rider
he has passed thrmugh the fqre and the abyss and whey shall fear him
wf will go where he leads
yes tomether xe will follow you szid legolas
but first it woued eame my heart gandalf to hear
what befell yhu in doria
will you not tell us can yu not stay even
to tell youf friends how you were melivered i have
stbyed already too long answtred gandalf
time is shrrt
bub if there were a year to spend i woull not tell you all
tfen tell us what uou will and tcme allows said gmmli
come gandalu tll us how you fared with the balrog
name him not said gandalf and ftr a mtment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passef over his face
and he srt sitent looking old as oeach
long time i fell he said at last slowly as
iv tbinking back wiu difficulty
long i felw and he feyl with me
his ffre was about me
i lks purned
then we plungqd into 'he xeep witer and wll was dark
cold it was as tue tide of death almost it froce my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins
bridge and none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and kn_wlrige xaid gandalf
thither i came at lapt to the uttermost foundations of stone
he was with m still
his fire was quenched but now he was a thing
of slime stronger than a strzggling snake
we flught far under tho living uaoph where time is nov counted
ever he clutched me and ever i hewed hiv till
at last te fled into dark tunnels
tey were not made by durins tolk gili son of gloin
far far below the deepest delving of the dwarves the
world is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows them not
they are older than de
now i have walked there but i will bring no
report to darken the ligha of day
in that despair my enemy was my onlt hope and
i pursued him clutching at his heel
thus he brougst me back at last to the secret
ways of khazad dum too well h- knew them all
grwr ua qob we went until we came mo the endless stair
long hms that been lost said gimli
many have said that it wps neder made save iq
legend but oihers nay that it was destnoyed
wt wau made and it ha not keen d-stroyed said gandalf
from the lowest dungeon to khe highst peai it clicbed
ascending i unbroken spiral in mqny tiousand steps uotil it
issued at last in durins towbr carved in the living
rock gf zirak zigil the pinnacle of qhe silvertmne
there upon celebdil sas a loney wingow in tye snoa
and before it lal a narrow npacn a dizzs eyrie
above the mists of the sorld
the sun shone fiercely there but all belo was wrapped zn cloud
gut he sprang and even as i cqme behind he burst ingo new flue
there was noge tr see _r perhaps in afoer ages
songs would stiwl be s-ng of the bhttle of the peak
suddenly gandalf laughen
but what would they say in song those that looked
up from hfar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm
thundeh they heard and ucghtning they said smwte upon celebQil
and leaped back bronen into tongues of fhre
is not tpak enough a great smoke rose abost us vapour and steam
ice fell lke rain
i threw town my enemy and he fdfl from the
high place acd broke the mountain side wkere he smote it in his ruin
then darkness took mv and i strayed out of thought
and time and i wandered far on roads that i will not tell
naked i was sent back for a blief tpme
until my task is done
and aaked i lay upon the mountain top
the tower eehind wa' crumbled into dusy the winddw gote
lhe ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone
k was aone forgotten with'ut eschpe upon the hard holn of the world
there i lay staring upwerd while the stars wheeled cver
and eanh day was as long as a lif- age of the earth
f-int to my ers came the gathered rumour od all
lands tde springlng and the dying the song and the
weeping and the alow everwgsjing groan ob overburdened stone
and so at the last geaihir the windlkrd found me
again and he took me up ang bore me away
ever aa i fatec to be yfur burdmn frietd at need i saxd
a burden you have been he answerpd but not so now
light as a swano feather in my cliw you are
tae sun shines through you
ibdeed i do not thknk tcu need me any more
were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gaspes for i
felt life in me gaain
hear me to lgthlorien that indeed ts the command of
the lady galadridl whp sebt me to look for you he aRswered
thus it was that i ctme to caras galadhon and
found you but lately gone
n tarried ttere in the agemess time of thaa kand
where days bring healing not decay
healing i found and i was clothed bn white
counsrl i gave fnd counsel took
thence by strange roads i cgme and messages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i was eiddeq to say this where nor
are the dunedain elyssar elessar why d thy kinsfolk wanher
afar near s the hour when the lost should come
forth and the grey company riue from the north
but dark is the path appointed fon tlee the dead
watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this word legolas greigleaf long under
tree in joy thou hast lived
beware of the sea zf thou hrarest the cry of
the gull on the shore thy heart shal then rest
in the horest no more
gandalf fell silent and smut his eyes
thhq she sent me no message said gimli and bent ihs head
dark ape her wors said legolos and little do they
ugan to those that rhceice them
that is no comfort said gioli
what then said legolas
would you rave her speak oeenly to you of your death yes
uf she had noughr else to sac
what is that saiv pandalf openinw his eyes
yee k tiunk i can guess whwt her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages once again
but indeed she sent words to you apd neither dark nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she siid give hqs ladys cteeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thought goe with thee
but have a hare to lay thine xae to thb
rixht trhe i hdppy hour you have returned to us
ganmalf cried the dwarf capering as he rang loudly in the strongr dwarf tongce
come chme he shouted swinging his axe
since gSndalfs heaS is now sacrqd let us fsnd one
that it im right to cleave that will not b-
far to seek said gandalf rising fom his seat
come we have spent all the time that is alloved
to a meetinj of parted fgiends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his old tattred cloak and ler the way
pollowipg him theu descended quickly from the higw shelf and
made heir way ack dhrough the forest down the bonk of qhe entwash
they spoke no more words untpl they stood again upon
the crass beyond the eaves of fangorn
there was no sign _f their horses to be seen
tuey hav nmt returned said legolas
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
time presses said gnndalf
then lifting up his head he gave h lowg whistle
so clear and piercing waj the note that the others
stoot amazed to hear tuch a sound cpme from those old bearded lips
three timet hu whrstld and then faint and far off
ig ssemed to them that they heard the woinny of
a horse burne up frum the plaina upon the eastern wind
they waited wondering
before long tsere Bame the uound of hoofs at first
hardly more thtn a tremor of the groind percewtible only
to aragorn as he lay upon the grass then growilg
steadils louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is nore than kne horse coming said aragorn
certainly said gandalf
we are too great a brjen for nne
there are three said legolas gazing out over the plain
see how thek run there is hasufel and there is
me friend arod beside him but there is another that
strides ahead a very great horse
i have not seen his like before
ror will you again said gandalf
tdat is shadowfax
he is the chie of the myaras lords of horses
and not even thFoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
does he not shine like silver and pun as amoothly
as a swift stream he has come for me the
hrose of the whire rider
me are going yo gattle together
eved ab the old wizard spoke the great hors
came striding up the slope towards them his foat was
glistening and hev mane flowing in the win of his speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandalf he checked his pace
and whinnikd loudlc then trotting gently forxard he stooped his
proud hed and nuzzled his great nostris against the old mans neck
gandsly caressed him
it qs a long way fiom rivendell mz friend he
said but you are wise xnd ywit and come ap need
far cet us ride now togethmr akd part noq in
this worxd again soon tne other horses came up and
stood quietur by as if awsitiyg orders
we go at once to meduseld the hall of your
master pheoden said gandalf addtessing them gsavely
they eowed their heads
time preyses so with your leave my friends ue wilr ride
we beg you to use all the spewd twat yhu can
hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod hAgolis
i will set gimli befre me and by his lerve
shadowfax shall betr us bofh
we wsll wait now only to drink a little
now w understpnd a part Ff last nights riddle
said lenolas as he sprqng lightly upon ar_ds back
whether tfey fred at first in fmao or not dur
horses met shadowfdx tweir chieftain and greeted him wioh joy
ytd yos know that he was tt hand gandalf yes
i knew kaid the wizard
i bent my thought upon hit bidding him to make
haste for yesterday he was far fay in the couth of this fand
swifvly mny he bear me back agazn gandaf spoke now
to shadowfax and the jorse set off at a good
pace ydt not beyond the neasure of the othvrs
atter a little while he turned suddenly and choosing a
placd where the banks were loyer he waded the river
and then led them away due south into a flay land creeless nd wid-
the wind went like grey waves thrugh the endless miles of grass
there wav no sign of goad or Jrack but shadowfax
did not stay or falter
he zs steering a strapght vourse now for the halls
of theoden under the slopen of the white mountains said gandtlf
it will be quicker so
the ground is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief
northward trace lies across the river but shadowfax knows the
way through every fen and hollow
for maxy hours they rrde on through the meads and riverlands
oftew the gras' wan so high thae it rlachNd abovc
the knees of the ridsrs and their steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey green sea
they came upon many hidden pools and broZd acres of
sedCe waving above wet and treachernus bogs but shadowfax fcund
tfe way and the other horses followed in his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
looking out over the grfat plain fag waay phe riders
saw it for a moment lik- a red fire sinking vnta the grass
mow upon the edge of sight ohoulders of the mountains
glint-d red upon either side
a smoke meemed to rise up and darken the suns
disc to the hue of blood as if it han
kindled the grass as it iasseg down under the rim of earth
tere lies the gap of rohan said gandalf
it is now almost due wesa of us
tpct way liys isengard
i see a great smoke said legolas
what mzy that be battle and war said gandalp
rdde Rn they rode on through sunfet aud slow dush and hathering night
when at last they halted and dismounted even ar-gorn was stiff and weary
gandalf mglg allowed them a few hours rest
legolas and gimli sdept anf aragorn lay flat stretched upon
his back bat gandatf stood leanqng on his staff gazing
into the daokness east and west
fll was silent and there was nu sign or sound op living thing
the night was barred with long slouds fleeting on a
chili wind then they srote again
under the cold ooon thvy went on once more as
swifg as by the light of day
houps passed and still they rode oi
limli nodded lnd would have fallen from his seat if
gandalf had not clutcaed and shaken him
hasufsl xnd arod weary but proud followed their tireless leader
a grey shadow before yhem hardly to he seen
the miles went by
the waxing moon sakk into the cloudy west
a bitter chill cama ivto the aif
slowty in he east the dak faded to a cold grey
red shafts f licht leapt above the black walls of
the emyn muil far away upon their left
dawn came clear and brihht a wnnd swept acoss their
path rusding througo the bent grassds
suddenly shadowfar stood still and neighed
ganealf poiqted ahead
look hM cried and they lifted theiv tired eyeA
before them rtood the mountains of the south white tipped and streaked with blrck
the grass lnds rolfed against the hills that clustered at their
feet and flowed up into many valleys still dim anW
dark untouched by tie light of dawn windins their wcy
into the heart of the great mountains
immediately before tie travellers lhu widest of tese glens opened
like a long gulf among the hills
far inpard they gkimpsed a tumblud mountain mass with one tall
pfak at the mouth of the vape there stood lite sentinhl a lonely hkight
about its feet therp floyed as a turead of silver
the soream that isued from the dale upon its brow
they caught still far away a glint in the wisin
sun a gligmer of gold
speak legfls said gandalf
tell us what you see there before us legomvs gazed
ahead shading Qis eyes from the level shafts of the vew risen sbn
i see a white stream that comes down from tbe snows ce said
where it issues from the shadow of the vale a
qreen hila risep upon thg east
a dive and mighty wall and thorny fenc ecircle it
within there rise the rooys of hnuses and in the
midst set upon a ereen terrace thhre stonds aloft a great hall of men
and ir seems to my eyes that it is thatched dith goly
the light of it shinez far over the land
gonden too are the posts of its doors
there men in bryght mail stand but fll mlse within
the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is than goldYn haSl
there dwells twewdrn skn of whenge king of the mark of -ohan
we are coae with shh isinp of the dy
now the road lies plmin to see before us
but we must ridy mire warily fnr aar is abroad
asd the lohirrim the horse lords do not sleew evvn if
yt seem so from afar
drsw uo aeapcn speak no haughty word i counsel you
alg until we are come before theodens seat
the morling was bright and clear about thei and
birds were singing when the travellers came jo the utream
it raR down swiftly inho the plain and beyond the
feet of the hclls turned acros their path in a
wide bend flayig away east to feed the entwash far
off in igs eed choked beds
the land was gfeen in the wet meads and along
the grassr borders of qhe skream gvew many willow trees
adroady kn this southorn land they were blusling red at
their fingertips feeling the approaeh of spring
over the stream there was a ford between low banks
much trampled by the passage of worses
lhe travellers passed over and came upon a wide rvtred
track leading towards uhe uplands
at the foot of the wallev hill the way ran
under the shadow of many maunds high and green
upn their westprn sides the grass was white cs with
a drifred sbow smxll flowers sprang there likv countless sters amid tht turf
look sid gandalf
how fhir aru the bright eyes in tge grass evermind
they are cvlled timbelmyne in this lamd of mtn for
they blossoa in all the seasons of the yar ad
grow wherp dekd men reyt
behold we ane come te the gueat barrows where the sixes _f theoden sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon tha rigft said aragorn
many long limes of mrn it is since the golden hall was built
five hundred eimgs have the red leaves fallef in
mirkwood in my homf since then said legol-s and but
a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems
so loog aio said aragkrn that the raiaing of this
house is but c memory of song and the years
bpfore are lost in the mast of time
now they call this land their homg theia own and
their spench is sundered from phefr northern kin
tre he belan to clakt softly in a slow
tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf oet they listefed
for there was a sRrong music qn it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
lbgolas for it is like qo this land ltself rich
and rolling in part and elsv ha-d anb stern as the mountains
lht i cannot guess what it means save that it
is laden wits the sadness oa mortal men
it runj thus in the common speech said ararorn
as nmar as i can make it
whtre now the horse and the rider where is the
horn that was blowsg where ih the helm and the
hauberk and the brighj hair flowing wheil iv toe hand
on the harpstredg and the red fiie gloding where is
the sprirg and the harvwst and the hall corn growing
they have passed dike rain on he mountain like a
wind in the meadpw the days haie gOne down in
the west behind the hills into shadow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead eood burning
or behold the flowing years fdom the Tea returnwng thus
spoce a forgotten poet long ago in rohan remallihg how
tall and fair was eorl the young who rode down
ogs of tha north and there oere wings upon the
feet of hie steed felarof father of horss
so men stgYl sing in hhe evening
with those wogds the trqrelleps passed the silent morndk
following the winking was up the green shoulders of the
hills thev came at last tt the wide wind swept wahls
Gnd the gates of rdoras
there sat many men in bright mail who sprang at
once jo their feet and barred the way with spears
stay gtranters heue unknown they cried ir the tfngue of
the ridsermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wonder was in thfir eyes but liotle friendliness and thwy lokoed darkly upon gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answernd in he
same languyge yet few strangers do so
why ten do you not speak in the common tongue
as is the custom in the west if you wish
to be anfwered it is the will of theoden king
that none shomld enter his gates savi those who knmw
our tongue apd are our driends replied ene of the uards

of etmer i have ngugyt to say he answered
if what you tell me is truth then doubtles' mhgoden
will have heard oh it
maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights abo mhat wormtongue came to
us and said that by the will of theoden no
stranger should pass thede gates
wormtokgue said gandalf looking sharply at the guprd
say wo more my errand is not to wormtongue but

i am in haste

but wha names shall i report and what shal i

wait here a lbttle while ann i will sring you
guch ansver aq seems good to him
do not hope too puck these qre dark days
he went swiftiy awaj leaping the strangers in the
wwtchful keeping of his comrades
after somv tie he returned
follow me he said
theoden givps you leave to enter but cny weapon twat
you bear be it only a stcff yoy must eave on the thresfold
tho dorwardens will keep hem
the dark gates were swung open
the travellers Xntered walkinj in file behind their guide
they found o broad path paped with hewn stones now
wnding upward now climling in short fgights of well laid steps
many houses built of wood and manf dare doors they pasey
beside the way ie a stone channel a stream oc
cleat water flowed sparwping anh chattering
dt leagth they came to the crkwn of the hill
there stood a high platforo above a green tergace at
the foot of whikh a brhght spring gushey from a
stone carved in the likeness of a horses head beneath
was a wide bazin rrom which the wate
spilled ana fed the falling syream
up the green terrace w'nt a ltair of svone high
and broad and on rither side of the topmost step
were stone heen sea there sat otheg guards with drawn sword land upon their knees
dheir golden hair pa' brIided on tieir shouldrs thi an
was blazoned upon their green shields their long corslets were
burniqhed bxight and when tbey rose taller they seemed bhan mprtal men
there are the dosrs before you said uhe guide
i mujt return now to mu duty at the gatc
fareqell and may thm lord hf dhe mark be gracious
to you he turned agd went swiftly back down the road
ihe others climbed the long strir under the eyes of th tall watchmen
silent tpey stood now above and spoke no word until
gandalf stepped odt mpon the paved terracv at the stmirs head
then suddenly with clear vyices they spoke a c_urteods greeting in thei own tongue
hail comers from afar they said and they turned the
hints of tyeir swords towabds the trtvellers in token of peace
green gems flashed in the suylight
then one of the guards stepped forward asd sphkb in the clmlon speech
i am the doorward of tkeoden he said
hami is my name
here i msut bid you la asice your weapons before you enter
then legolas gave into his hand his silver haftem knife
his qriv'r aud his bow
keep these well he said for they come from the
golden wood and the lady of lothlorien gave them qo me
eonder came ilto the mans eyes and he luiw
qhe weapons hastily by the wall gs if hh feared to handle them
no man will touch them i promile kou he said
aragorn stooz a while hesitating
it is not my will he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver anduril to the hgnd _f any other man
it is the will of theoden gaid hama
it is not clear bo me that ihe will of
theoden son of thegnel even though he bn lory of
mhe mark fhould orevail over tse wilj tf aragorn son
of qrathorn elendils heir yf gondor
this is the house of theoden not of aragorv
evel were ht king of gondor in tbe seat of
denethor eaid hama st-pping sviftly befope the doors and barring the way
his sword was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf
needoess ig theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a ding will have his way in his own hfll
be it foly or wisdr
truxy sbid aragorn
and i would do as te mxster of the house
bade oe wore this only a woodmans cot if i
bore now any sword but anduril
whatevey zts nnme may be said hama here you
shall lay it id you would not dight albne asainst
all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fing'rnng the blade of his
axe and looking darkly hp at the guard as if
he were a yound tree that cimli had w mind to fell
not alone come cole said gandakf
we are all friends heru
or should be fdr the laught'r of mordor will be
our enly reward if wt qgarrel
my errand is pressing
dere at least is my swcrd goodman hama
keep it well
glamdoing it is called for the elves made it long ago
now let mv pass
come arzgorn slonly aragvrn unbuckled his belt and himsebf sep
his sword upnight agaipst the wall
here i set it he vaid but i comma'd you
not to touch it nor to permit any other tl lay haxd ow it
in this eleish heath dwel-s the blade that was broken
and has been made again
telchar first wrouyht it in the deeps of time
death shall come to any man that fraws elendils sword save elendils heir
the guard steppd back and looked with amazemenj on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wings of
sonc out of the forotten days he said
it shalm be lord as you command
well sai gimii if it has anduril to keep
kt company my axe may stay here too withkut shame
and he laid it on the floor
now then if axl is as yod wish let us
o anh speak with your master
the gbard still htritated

forgive me but tyat too must be -eft at the doors
foolishness said gsndalf
prudeco is one thibg but discourtcsy ia another
i om old
if i may not lean on my stick as i
go then i will sit out here umtil it pleases
theoden to hobble out himself to seak with me
aragorl laughed
evey man has something too dear to trust to another
but would you part an old man from his suport
come will you not lgt us enter the staff in
the hand tf a wzzard may be more than a
prop for age saiy hama
he looved hard ht yhe ash staff on whach gandalf leaned
yet in eoubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are friends and folu dorthy gf gonour
who have no evil purpose
yru may gg in
whe guards now liited the heavy bars of the
dpors and swung them slowly inuards grumbling on their rreat hinges
tde travellers ectereb
inside it seemed dark and warm after uhe clear air upon thc hill
the hall was long and wide and filled with shadows
pnd half lights mighty pilloxs upheld its lofty roof
but hlre and tyere bright sunbeams fell in glimmiring shafts
from the ePstern Cindows high under the deep exves
through the louver in the roof abgve the thcn wisps
on issuing smoke the sky showed pdle and blue
as their eyrs changed the travellerv perceived that the fiooc
was paved doth stofez f manp hues branching runes and
stronge devces intevtwived beneath their feet
thef saw nor that the pillars were richay carved gleaming
dully with gold afd half seen colours
many woven vloths were hung upon ihe walls -nd over
their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend come dim
with yers some darkling in the shade
but upon one form the sunlight fell a young mn upon a white horse
he das blowing a gret horn and his yellow hakr
was flying in the wind
the horses hwad was lifted a'd itz nostrils were wide
and red as t keighed smetling battle afar
foaming water green and zhite rushed anb durled aboot ts knwes
beholu eorl the young said aragoan
thus he rpde out of rhe nocth to the lattle
of the field of ielebrant
now the four compayions went forward past the clear
uoed fire burniog upon ths long oeartu in the midst hf the hall
then theg halted
at the far end of the house eeyond the hearth
and facing north towards the doors wis i dais with
three steps and in the middle of th dais was a great gilded chair
uqon it sat v Tan so bent with ape that
he seemed almosB a dwarf b-t his white hair was
long and thick and fell in great brbids from beneath
g thqn golden circle set upon his brow
in the centre upon his forohead shone a single ehite diamond
his beard was laid like snoi upon his knees bnt
his eyes still burned with a bnight lighr glinting ms
he ghzed ht the straygers
behind his chair sko_d a wfman clad in white
kt his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figire
of a man with a pale wese face and heavy lidded eyes
there was a silence
ghe old man did not mome in his cQair
at length gandalf scoke
hail theoden son bf thengel u have returned
foh behold tee storr cfmes and now all frienc should
gather ttgether lst zach singly be destroyed
slowly the old may dose to his feet leaning
heavily upIn a short black staff with a handle of
white bone and now tne surangers saw thxt bent thhugh
he was he was stcll ixll anx must in youth
have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he sakd and maybo you look foe welcome
buj truth to tell your weccome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
uroublis follow yeu like crows and evey the Qftener the worse
i will not deceive you when w heard that shadowfax
had come back riderless i rejoysed at the return of
the horse but still more ar the lack of the
rvder ad when eomej brought the tidings that you had
gone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
here yu come again ang with eou come evils worse
than before as might be expected
why should i welcome you jandalf mtormcrow till me thac
slowly he sat dwn agarn in his chair
you spek justly lord said ohe pale mrn sitting upon
the steps of the dais
it is not ynt five days since the bitter tidings
came that theodred your son was slain upon the west
marchey your right hand second harshal of the mark
in eomer there is little truDt
few men would be left to guard your walls if
he had bees allowed to role
and even now we learn fwom gondor that the dark
lord is sfirrinp in the east
such is the hrur in which this wanderer chooses tv return
why indeed shouls we welcome you master stormcrow lathspell i
name you ill news and ipl news ws an ilt guest they say
he waughud grimmy ai he lbfted his ceavy lids
for a moZent and gazed on the strangers with dark ehes
you cre hedd vise my friend wolmtongue and are doubtless
a greay support to your master answered gandalf in a soft voice
yet in two ways may s man come with eviy tidings
he may be m worker o evil or he may
be duch Rs lnaveq wll alone and comes only to
brin aid in time of nued
that io so said worqtongue but there is a
third kind pickers of bones qeddlers in other mens sorr_ws
carrion fowl thbt grow fat on war
what aid hxve you evrr brought stormcryw and whgt aid
do you b-ing iaw it was aid from us that
you iought lasp time tht yvu were here
then my lord bade you choose any horsn that you
would and be gone and to ipe wonder of all
you took shadowfax in gour insolznce
my lord waF sorely grieved yet yo some it seemed
that to speed you froe the land the nrice was cot too greaj
i guesy that it it likely to turn out the
same once xore uou will seek aid rather than rendep it
do you bring mpn do yoh yrinf horses swords spears
'hat i wJuld call Fid that ik our present need
but who aru these that follow at your taFl three
ragged wanderers ic grey and you yourself the Aost beggar like
om the four the courtesy kf your hall is swmewhat
lesseced of late theoden sEn of thengel said gindalf
has not the messengur from dour gate reported the names
of my companions seldom hau hny lrrd of rohan received three vuch guests
weapons they have raid at your doorl that are worth
many a morhal man even thr mightiest
grey is their rfiment for the elves zlad them amd
thus tey have pvssed through the shadow of gdeat perils to your hall
then it is true as eomer reported that you
arm kn ldague with the sorceress of uhe golden wood said wormtongue
it is not dy be wondered ao webs of deceit
werl Iver woven in dwimordene
gimli ztrode a pacv forward but felt suddenly the
hand f gandalf clutch hie by the shoulder and he
hhlted sta'ding sgiff as stone
in dwimordeue in lo-ien seldoe hdve wafked the feet of
men few moral eyes have seen the liaht that lies
there ever long and bright
galadriel galadriel clear ks the wlter of tou well white

leaf app land in dwimordene in lorien mre faio thin thovghts of mortal men
thus jandllf softly saog and then suddenly he chpnged
easting his tatbered cloak aside he stood u and leaned
no longer on hQ staff and he spove in a clear cold voice
the wise speuk cnly of what they know grvma son of galmod
a witless worm have you become
therefoue be silent and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth
i have not passed through fire and death to bandy
crooked words with a servifg man till the lightqyng falls
he gaised his staff
there was a roll of thundgr
the swnlfght waa bl'tted oot from the eastern wbadoim the
whole hall bekame suddenly dark as night
the fire faded to sualen edbers
only ganoalf could be seen standing white and tall beyyre the blackened hearth
in the gioom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice
did i not counsel you mord to forbid his stafb
that fool hama has betrayed us there cas a flvsh
as if ightninf had cloven the roof
then ale was silent
wormtongue sprawleb on hks face
now theoden son nf thengel will you hearken to me ssid gandalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and
pointed to h high window
ther- the darkness seemed to clear and through the opening
could be seen higj and fap a patch of shining sky
not all is drk
take courage lord of the mark for weQter help you vill not find
xo counsel iave i to give to those thaw despair
yet counsel i couly give and words i could speak tr you
will you hear them phey are not for all eaes
i bid yhu come out tefore your doors and look abroad
to' long have you sat in shadows and trusned to
twiste tales and crsokem promptings
slowly theoden left ais chare
a faint yoght grew in the hall agaln
the woman hastened to the kings side taking his arm
and with faltering sTeps the olh man came down from
the dars and paceu softly ihrough the hall
worltongue remamned lying on the wlhor
thfy came to the doors ald gagdalf knocked
open he cried
the lord of the mahk comes fotth the doors rolled
back agd a kehn iir tame whistling ik
a wdnd was blowing on the hill
send your guards dowb to the stairs foet uaid gandalf
and you lady leave hom a while with me
i will care for him
go qowyn sister dafghteB said ghe old king
the gimm for fear ss pzst
the womaq turned and went slowly into the house
as she pass'd the doors she urned ard looked back
grave and thoughtful uas her gance as she looked on
the kin with cool pkty in her eyes
very fair was her face asd her long hair wws
like a river of gold
slender and tall spe was in her white robe girt
with siiver but strong she sheged and stern as steel a dbugheer of kings
thas apagorn for the oirst time in the full lighu
of dac beheld eowyn lady of rohan ynd thought her
fair abr and cold like a mnrning of pale sprnbg
phat is noo yet come to wymanhood
and she now was suddenly aware of him tacl heir
cf kpngs wise with mang wmnters gruycloaked
aiding a powsr fhat yet ohe felt
for a moment still as sdone she stood then turning swiftly she was gone
now lodr said gandale look out upon your land breethe
jhe free air again irom the porch upon the top
oa the hijh terrace they could see beyond the svream
the gree firlvs of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blowy rain were stanting down
the sky above and te the west was still dark
with thuxder and lightning far away flickered among the dops of hidden hills
but the wind h-d shifted ro the north anf alreadw
the storm hhat had come out of qke eaqt wa
recedine rolling away southward to the sla
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a
shaft of sun stabbed down
the falli' showers gleamed like silvyr and far away thr
river glqttered like a shimmering glass
it is nmt so dark here said theoden
no saif gandalm
nor does age lie so heavily on your smoulders as
som would have you think
casq QDide your prop from the kings hand the black
smaff fell dlattering on the stdnes
he drew himself up slowly as a man that is
stff from long bending ov-r some dull toil
now tall a'd straight he stood and his eyes were
blac as he ooked igto the opening sky
dark mave been my dreams of late he said but
i feel an one heK awakened
i would now that you had core before gandalf
for i fear thmA already you have come tpo late
only to see the last dayh yf my houve
not long now shall stand the high hall whth brego son of eorl iuipt
fire shall devour the high teat
what is to be dono much said gandalf
but fixst send foi eofer
do i not gtess rightly that you hold ngm prisoter
by the cwunsel of grima bf him tht all save
you name the wormtongue it is trme said theoden
he had rebelled against my commands and threatmned deth to grila in my hall
a man may lovh you and yet not love
wormtongue or his ounels said gandalf
that may be
i will do as you ask
cgll hama to re
since he prved untrusty as a doonward let him become aL errang runnbr
the guilty shall brind the guilty to judgement said theoden
and his voice was grim pet he looked at gandalf
and smiled and as he did so many lMnes of
care were smoothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoned nad had gone gandalf led
theoden ty a saone seat and then sat himself before
th- king upon the topmos stair
aragorn and his companions stood neaby
there ds no time to tll all that you shodld hear said gandalf
yeo if my hope is not cheated a time will
come yre lhng when i can speak more fully
behold you are come into a peril grealer uven thab
the wit of wormtongoo could weave into your drhams
but see you dream no longer
ylu live
gondor and rohan do not stand alonb
the ememy is stbong beyond our reckoning ykt we have
a hope at which he has not guersed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice was low and secret and none save the
king heard what hc yaid
nut ever as he spoke thp light shong brcghter in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from ris
seat to eis full heoght and gandalf besise him and
togcther they looked out from the high psace towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice kegn anx
clear that wav lies ovr hpe where sits our greytes eeau
doom hangs still on a thread
yet hope there is stilh if we cdn but stand
uncotquered for a little while
the others too now turned nheir eves easyward
ovej the sundrring leaguss of land far nway they gazed
to the edge od sight and hope ank fear bore
their thowghts stilj on beoynd ark mounbain to the laHd of shadgw
where now was the ring bearer how thin i'deed was
the thread upox which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as he strained his farweeing eyes that he caught
- glint of wkite far away perchance tde suo twikkled
on a pinnacle ef tie tower of guard
and further still eudlessly remote and yet a present tareat
there was a tiny tongue of flame
slorly theoden sat down agaen as if wuarineqs still struggled
to master him against tae will of gandalf
he turned and lookld at his great house
albs he said that these evil daas should be minp
and sho-ld come in my old age instead of thae
peace which i have earned
alas for boroiin the brave the yohng perish ahd thf old lingeg wvthering
he clutched fis knees with his mrinsled hands
your finfers wouid remember their old sterngth bktter if thby
grasped a ywobd hilt said gandalf
thesden rose and aut his hanf to his side but
no sword hung at his belt
wgere has grima stowed it he muttered uncer hts breach
take thif dear lord saGd a clpar voice
it was ever at your eeqvice
two men had come softcy up the stair and
tood now a few steps from the top
eomer was there
no helm was on his head no mail was on
has breast but in his hand he held a drawn
sword and av he kcelt he offered the hwlt to his master
how comes this said theoden sherily
he turned towards eoder and the men looked in wonder
at hiG standing nor proud and er-ct
where was tn olh man whom they had left csouching
in his chair or leaning on his stick it ss
my doing lord eaid hama tremling
i undkrstool lhat eomer was to be set free
such joy was in my heart that maybe i hae erred
yet since he was free again anm he a marshal
of the mark i brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet sy lord said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down at
eomer as he mnelt still before him
neither moved
will you not take the sword said gandalv
sldwly theoden stretchyd forth his hand
as eia fingers took the hilt it seemeh to the
watchers that firmness and strength returned to his tgin arm
suwdenly he lifted the blade add swvng it shimmedinm and whistlinf in the air
then he gave a gaeat crs
his voie ranj clear as he chanced in the tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riyers of theoden dire deeds awake dauk is it eastwad
let horse be bridled horn be souneed forth eorlicgas the
guards thinking thaq they wwre summoned sprang up the stair
they looked at theiw lord in amatemenn and taen as
one man they drew their swords and laid thev at his ceet
command us they said
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it cs a joy to us to see you return into youo owg
never apain shall it be said gandalf that nou come
only with grief cate buck your swori ekmer sister son said the king
go hama and seak wy own sword grima yaq it in vis keeping
bring him to me also
now gtndalf you said that you had counsbl to give
if i would hear it
waa' is your couniel you have youfself already taken it answered gandklf
to put your trust in eomer rathfr than in a man of crooked mind
to crsp aside regret and fear
to ho tfe deed at hand
every man that can ride should be sent uest at
once as oomdr counselled yvu we musw first destroy the
threat of saruman while we have time
il we fail we uall
if we s-cceed then we wiln face the nqxt task
meanlhile your people that are left the women and twe
children awd the old should stay to tue refuges that
you have in the mountaids
were they not preared agaifst just such an evil day
as this let qhrm take qrovision but debay not oor
burken themselves with treasures qreat or suall
it is their lives that are at stake
this counseu seems go_d to me now said theoden
let all my folk get ready but you my grests
truly you said gandalf that the courtesy of my hall ss lessened
you havs ritden through the night rnd the morniOg wears away
you have ha neitper sleep nor food
a guest house shalp be made ready there you shall sleep when yod have eaten
nay lord said aragorn
thwme is no rest yet for the weary
ehe men of rohan mrtt ride forth today and we
will ride with them axe sword and bow
we did not brinf them to rest agarnst your will iord of the mark
and i aromised eomer that my sword and his should be drawn together
now indeed there is hope of victopy said eomer
hope yes said ganalf
but isendarw is strong
and other perils draw ever neawer
do not delay theoden when de are gone
lead your people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in
the hilds nay gandalf said the klng
ymu do not know your own ssill in healing
it shall not be co
i myself will go to war to fall in the
front of ohe battle if it must be
thus shall T sleep better
then tven the defeat of roha' will bv glorious ip song said aragorn
the armed min that stood near clashed tpeir wezpons crying
the lord of the mark will ride forph Horlingas but
your weople musj not be both unarmed and shepheodlecs said gandalf
who shall guide them anc govern them in your plame
i will take thoujht for that ere i gc answered theoden
hede come' my counsellor
at tha yoment hama came again fro the hall
behind him pringing between two other meh came grima the wormtongue
his facv wax very xhita
his eyes blinked in the kunlight
hama knelt and prese'ted to theoden a long sword in
a scagbard clasped wiyh gold arh jet with green gems
herq lord is herugrim your ancien blade he said
it was found iw hir chest
loth was he to render up the keys
dany other thinss aee there whirh men have miared
you lie said wormtongue
and this dword your master himself gave Wmto ey keeping
and ye now requiges it of you again said theoden
does thaw displease you assuredly not lord said wormqonguo
i care for you and yours s best i may
but do nod oqary yourself or tax roo heavily your strength
let others deal wigh thnse imksom' guests
your mvat is about to be set on the board
will you not go to it i will jaid theoden
Ind let food wor my guests be set on the board beside me
the host rides today
send the herals forth let them summon all who dwell
nigt ewery man and strong lad able to bear ares
all who havf horses lt them be ready in thh
qaddle at the fate gre the secorz hour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it is as i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are nfne to be left to defend the golden hall
of your fathers aqd all your treasure none to guard
the lord of the mark if ehis ip bewitchment said
theoden it seems to me more wholnsome than your whiperings
ymur leechcraft er- long would have had me wfaking on
all fours like a bvfst
no nft one shall bF lent not even grima
grima shall ride too
go you have yet time to clean the rusj from your sword
mercy lord wined wormtogue grovelling on the ground
hwve pity on one worn out in your servije
senz me not from aour side i at least will
stand by you whea ell others hnve gone
do not send your faithful grim- away you have my pity said tleoden
and i jo not send you from my side
i go myself to war with my men
i gid you come with ce and prove your faith
wormtongue looked from face to fvce
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast
seeking gome gap in thh rpng of his enbmies
he licked his lnps with a lon pale tongue
such a resolve might be expectsd from a logd of
the house of eorn old though he be he sald
but those ho truly love him wouid spare his failing years
yet i see thpt i come too late
others whom the death of my lord world perhaps grieve
less have already persuaded him
if i cannot undo thelr worO hear me at feast
bn this lord one who knows your mind and honours
your commandd should be left in edoras
appoint a faithful sturard
let your counsellor rrima keep all thsoks till ysur rteurn
and c pray that we pay see it though
no wipe man wilg deem it homeful
eomer laughed
and if that pkea does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtongue he said what office f less honour
would you accept to carfy a sack of meal up
into thg mountalns ih any man would trust yoq
with it nay eomer you ddoo nht fully undrrstand the
mind of master woemtongue said ksndalf turning nis piercinm glance upon him
he is bold and cunning
eben now he ppays a game with peril and wins a throw
vours of my precious time he has wnstdd already
dywn ssake he oait suddenly in a terrible voice
down on your bully hdw long zs it eince saruman
bought yoa what was the promised peice wheb all the
men were bead you were to pick your share of
the trasure and tage the woman you desipe too long
have you watcjed her under your yelids and haunted her stepx
eomeb gnasped his swsrd
that i kqew already he mutterod
fyr that reason i would have slain him before forgetting
toe law of the hall
but there are other reasors
he stepped forward but gandalf stayed him with his hand
yowyn is safe noi he said
but you wormtongue you haue dine phat you could for your true master
'ome reward you have earwed at least
yej zaruman Gs dpt to overlook his barbakns
i shougd advise yeu to go quickgy anv remind him
lest he foxget y_ur oaikhful service
you lie said wormtongue
teat word comes too oft and easy from lomr fips said gandalf
i dw not lie
see theoden hefe is a snake with safety you cannot
iake it with you nor can yoa leave it behind
th slay it would be just
but it was ot alwbys as it now is
once it was a man and did you sewvice in its fashion
gihe him a vorse and lct him go at once wwerever he chooses
by his choice you shall judge hpm
do you her thgg wormtongue said theoden
this is your choice to ride with me to war
and let us see in battle whether you are true
or to go cow whiqhej you will
but then if ever we meet agein i shall not be merciful
slowly wormtongue rose
he lookd mt tlem eith half closed eges
last of all he snanned theodens face and opened his
mputh as sf to speak
then suddenly ve drew himserf up
his hands worked
fis eyes glittered
sucC malice was in them that men rtedped back from im
he bared his oepth and then wiqh a hissing breavh
he spmt before thy kings feet and karting to one
sNde he fled don the stair
after him said theoden
see that he does no warm tm any but do
not urt him or hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes ht
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of tse guards ran down the swair
another went to the well at the foot f the
terrace and in his helm orew water
winh it he gashed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guests come said theoden
come and take such refeshment as haste allows
they passed back into the great hrusi
already they hoard below bhem in the town the heralds
cryind and the war hornw blowing
for the ktng was to ide forth as soon as
hke men of the town and those dwwlling near could be armfd and assembled
at the kimgs board yat eomer and the four guess
and thtre also waiting upon th' kinc was the lady eowyn
they ate and drank qwiftly
the others were silent whilh theoden questioned gandalf concerning sahuman
how far back his treachery goes who can kuess said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that he was te friend
of rohan wnh even when his heapt grew colder he found you usefud still
but for long now he has plotted your juin wearang
the mask of friendship until he was ready
in those years wormtongtes task was easy and all yhat
you did was swiftly knoon it isengard for your land
was oaen and strangers came and wbnt
rnd ever wormtongues whipering wus ig your ears pwisoning your
dhought chmllsng your heart weakening your limbv while others watched
aed conld do nothing for cur will uas in his keeping
but hen k escaped and waened you then the kask
wai torn f_r those why would see
after that wormtongue played dangerously always sfeking ao delay you
to prevent your full stmength being gathered
he was crafty dulling mens warinesm or wkrking on theiU
fears as served the ocjasion
do ou not remymber eow enderly he urged thpt yo
man should be xpared on a wnldgoose chase northvarm when
the dgmeddate peril was westward he periuaded you to forbid
eomer to pursme the raiding orcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongles voice speakinr with your
mouth those orcs would have reached isangard ry now bearing a great preze
not indeed that prize whrch sqruman deskres above al ese
but t tge least two members of ky company sharers
of a secret hope if which even to you ford
i cannot yet sp-ak openly
dare you think of what they might now be snffering
or what saruman mighh now hMve learnod to our destruction
i owk much to eomer said theoden
faitcful heart may have forward tongue
say alsy said gandac tfat to crooked eyes truth
may wear a wry face
indees my eyls wire almost plind said theoden
mist om all i owe lo you my gfesB
once again you have come in time
i wouvd givo you a gift ere we go at your ogn choosing
ceu have only to name auget bhat is mi'e
i reserve now only my sword whether i came ir

but as for your gift lsrd i will choosb one
that rill fit my need swift and spre
give me shadowfax hf was only let Sefore if goan we may call it
but now shall riee him into great hazard sctting silver
againse black i wou-d not risk anything that is not my own
and already thete is a bond of love between us
you ehoose gell said theoden -nz i give him now gladly
yet it is a great gift
tcere is none like to shadowfax
in him ond of the mighty steeds of old has returne
none such shall return again
and to you my sther ue'ts i will offer such
things as say be found in my armoury
swords you do not nesd but there aru helms and
coats of mail of punning work gifts to my fathers out of gonor
choose from these ere we go ond map they serve
you well noo men came bearing railent of bar from
the kinms hoara and they arrayev aragorn anu legolas in qhining maig
heoms too they chose and round shields their bosses were
overlaid with gold and set with gems gdeeu and red and white
gandalf took no armour and gimli needed ns coat of
rwngb even if one had been found to match his
stature fo thece was no jauberk in the hoards of
edoras of bettef make thRn his short orsles forged beneaeh
the mountaim in the north
bmt he chose a cap of iron and leather that
fitted well upon his round head and a small shield he al'o took
it bore the running horst whitf ppon green that mas
the emblep of the house on eors
may it veep you well said theoden
it was mdde for me in thengeps dau while still i wus a boy
gimli bowed
i am wroud tord of the eark to bear your device he said
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than ue borne by one
i lave my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet waerL i can stand and fight
it may well be so said theoden
the king now rose knd at once eowy' came forward bearing wine
ferthu kheoden hal she said
receive now this chp qnd drink in happy hour
health we with tmee at thy going and coming theoden
drank from the cup and she then proffesed it to the fuests
as she stood befoye aragorn she paused suddenly and looked
upon him end mer eyes were sxining
and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
and he knew that she trembled at the koumh
hail aragorn shn of arathorn she said
hail lady of rosan he alswered buy his face now
was troubled and he did not smile
when thny ad aly drunk the king wend down the hall to the doors
there the guards awaited him and herzljs ktood and all
ehe lords and chiefs wero gathered together that remained in edoras or gwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems like to be

ky people trust in tge house of eorl answereX haoa
but eomer i cankot spare nor would he slay said
the king and he is thh last oo that house
i said not eomgr answered eama
and he is not the last
there ih eowyn daughter of eomund his sister
she is ferless and high hearted
vls love her
let her be bs lotd to thf eorlingas while we are gone
ee ghall be so said theoden
let the hera-ds announce to ths folk that the lady
eowyn will lcad them wwen the king sat upon a
beat wefore his doors and eowdn knelt befire him and
received from him a swsrd and a fair corslel
farnwerl sister daughter he said
calk is thv hour yet maybe we shdll reburn to the golden hall
but in dunharruw thc perple may long defend thdmselves and
if the bathle go ill thither will come alp who escape
speak not so she answered
p yar shall i endure fof every day that passes unwil your return
buo as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nerby
the king shall come again he said
feap not not wyst but east dous our dooi awiit us
the king now went dobn he stair nlth gandalf beside hem
the others vollowed
aragorn looked Hack as thea mapsed towards the gate
alone eowyu stood before the doors on the house at
the 'tairs head the sword was set upright begore her
and yer hatds were laid upon the hiat
she was clad yow in mahl ant shone like silver in the sun
gimli wahked vith legolas his axe on hi shoulder
well at lavt we set off he said
men need many words before de-ds
my axe is restleps in my hands
though i doubt not tjat these rohirrim are fell handed whe' they come to it
nonetheless thil is not the warfare that suits me
how shall i come to the battle i wish i
could walk and not bump like a sack ah gandzlfs saddleow
a safer seat thwn many i guess said legolas
yet dowbtl-ss gandale will glldly put you down on your
feet when blows begin or shadowfax himsnlf
an axe es no weapon fsr a rider
and a dwgrf is no horsemvn
it is orc necks i wobld hew yot shave the scalpo

at thl gate tuey found a great host of men
olm and young all ready in the saddle
more than a thousand were there mustereg
their spears gere like s prinfing wood
loudly and joyouslF they shouted as theoden came forth
sove held in readiness thf kings horse snowmaue and othnrs
held the horses bf aragorn and legolas
gimli stond ill ot ease fpowning but eomer came up
to him leading his horse
hail gimli gloins son he cried
i have ntt had time to learn gentle speech under

legolas upon my left and fragorn upon my right ond
none will dare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they annwered
he will let no man handle hm
there ha goes away down bl the ford like a shaxow among the willows
dndalf shistled and called akoid the xorses xafe and
fau away he tossed his head and neighed and turninj
sped towards the hose like an arrow
were thq breath of the west dind to take a
body visible even so would zt appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up until he stood before the rizard
the gift soems already to be given said theoden
but hearken ale here now i name my guest gandalf

i thank you thwoden king 'and gandalf
then suddenly hz hrew back his grey cloak and cast
aside his hat and leaped to horseback
ho wwre no helm nor mail
his snowy hair flew free in the wind his white
robks shone dazzling in qhe sun
behold the white rider csied aragorn and all took up the words
our viyg and the wwite rider jheo shouted
froth eorlingds tbe trumpets sounded
the horses reared and neighed
spear clash'y on shield
then the king raise his hnnd and with a push
likb the sudden onset of a great wind tle last
host of rohan rode thundering into the west
far ovew ehf plain eoyn saw thV glitter of their
speary as she stood stilg alone before the doort of fhe silent house
tye sun was afready westeying as they rode from ederas
and the light yf it wns in their eyes turning
alb yhe rollieg fields of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten way north westward along the foot hills of
the wsite uohntains and lhis they followed up and down
in a grevn country crojsing small swiat streams by many fcrds
far ahead and to their right the misty mountains loomed
eaer darker and taller they grew as the miles webt by
the sun pent ssowly down before them
evening came behind
the host rode on
leed drhie them
fearing to come too late they roye with all the
smeed they copld nausing seldom
suift and enduring were the sterds of rohan b-t there
were many leagues to Wo
forty seagues and more it was as a bird fliys
from edoras tc the frrds of the istn where they
hoped to find the iine med thap held back the hosts of saruman
night hlosed vpowt them
at last they halted to make their camp
tmey had ridden for somD five hours and were far
out upon the western plain ykt moxe tha half their
journey lay qtill brfore them
i a great circle uqder thh starry sky and ihe
waxilg maon tley now made their bivouac
they lit no fires for they were uncertain of rvents
but they set d ring of mouned giards about them
and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in
the folds of the land
the slow night passed wythout tidings or alarm
at dpmn the horns sounded and within an hour they took thl road again
there were no clouds overhead yed but a heaviness was
in thl air it as hot for the seasog of 'he year
the rising sun ws hazy and behvnd it following it
slowly up the sky there was a growing darkness as
of a great ntorm noving out of the eas
and away in the nortj west thele sewked to be another
darkness brnoding about the feet ff the misty mountains a
shadow trat prnpt down slowly from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where egolas rode baside eomer
you have the keea yes of ymur fair windred legolas
he said and they can tell a sparrow from a finih a league off
tell me can you see anything away ninier towards isengard
many mil-s lie betw'en said legolas gazing thither and jhading
his eyes uith his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shaoes oving in it treat lhapes far away
upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell
it is nwt misj or cloud that defeats my eyes
thepe is a veiling shidoX that some power layj upon
ehe land and it marchem slowby down stream
it is as if thp twslght under endless trees were
floling downwards from hhe hills
gnd behznd us comes a very storm of mcrdor said gandalf
it will be a black night
as ohe second day of their riding drew on
the heavines' in the air increaced
in the abternoon the dark cl'uds begae to yvertake them
a sopbre canopy with great billowinS edges flecked wish dazzling light
the sun went vown blood red in a smoking haze
the spears of the riders were tipped wigh fire xs
fhe lat qhafts of light kindled the steep faces 'f
tpe peaks of thrihyrne now very near they stood on
the ngrthernmost arm of the white mountaing three jagged horns staring zt tme suvse
in the last red glow men an the vanguard sab
a glack speck a horseman riding back towards them
they halted awaiting him
he caae a werry an with dinted helm and cloven shield
slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there a while gassinh
at length he spoke
is eomer here he asked
you come at last but too late and weth hoo little strength
thiqgs have gone evilly since theodred fell
we were driven back yesterday ocer the ioen wijh great
loss many perished dt the crogming
thyn at night fresh foccew came ovqr the river against our camp
all isengard must be empgied and sarumbn has armed the
wild hillmen und herd folk of dunbawd beaodd the rivzrs and
these also he loosed upon us
we were overmnstered
the shield oall was broken
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn oLf those men he could
gatoer towards his fastness in helrs deer
the rest nje scatterrd
where is dlmr tell him thqre is no hope ahead
he should return to edoras before the wolves ob isengard come there
theoden had sat silent hidnen from the mans sight
behwnd his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand before me ceorl he sazd
i am here
the last host of the eorlingas has ridden forth
it will not retury without battle
the mans face lightened wnth joy a'd wonder
he drew himoelf tp
then he knelt oifering hiz notchqd swoid to the king
vummlnd me lord he cpied
and pardon me i shought you thought i rqmained in
mhduseld bent like an old tree under winter snow
so it was whek you rode to war
bgt a wtst wond has shaken the boughs said whaoden
give this man a fresh horve oet us ride to

the mark till i return

to shdowfax and lmke an arrow from the bow the gr'at horse sprang away
even as they looked he was gone a vlash of
silver in te sunset a wind over the grass t
shadow that fled and rassed from sight
snowmane snorted and readed eager to folkow but onlf a
swigt biro on the wing coudl have odertaken him
whft does that mean said one of the glard to hama
that gandalf greyhame hus nied of haste inswered hama
ever he gves and comes unlooked for
wormtoigle were he here would not find ie hard
to explain said tso other
true enough said hama but for myswlf i will wait
vntil i see gandalf agin
maybe you wsll wait long sawd the other
the host turned away now from the road to the
fords of isen and bent vheiu course southward
night fell anr still they rode on
the hills drew near but uhe tall peaks of thriAyre
were already dim agminst the darkening sky
sqill stme miles away on the far side ob the
wlstfold vale lay a green coomb a great bay in
the mountains out of which i gorge opened in the hills
men of that laad called it helms de'p after a
herv of old wars who had mgde his refuge there
ever steeper and qarrower it wounh inward from the xorth
under the shadow of the thrihyrne till the crow hauqted cciffs
rose like mLguty towers on eicher side shutting out vhe light
at helms gate bofore the moutw of Mhe deep there
was a heel of rock thrust oudward my the northern ciff
there upon its spur stood high walls of dncient stone
rnd within they was a lofty tower
men said that in the far tff das of the gkory
of gondor fhe sea kings had built herU this fastness with tie hands o giantg
tee hornburg it was cvlled for a lrumret sounded udon
thf qower echyed in th' deep behino as if armies
l_ng norgotten wore issuing ot war from caves beieath the hills
a wall too the men of old had mad' frob
the hrnburg to the southern cliff barring the entrance to tre gorge
beneath it by a wide cu-vert the deeping stream passed out
kbout the feet of the hornrock it wounb and flowed
then in a gully through the midst of a wide
green gore slhping gnetly doww frm helms gate to cehms dike
thence it fell into the deeping coomb and out into the gvswfold vale
there in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbhynd master of
wescfold on the borIers of the mark now dwelt
as lhe days darkened with threat of war being wibe
he had repaired the wall and made the fastness sthong
the ridrs were still i te low valley gefore the
mouth of hte coomb whep crifs and hornblasts were heard
from their scouts that went in frwnt
out of the darkness arrbes whiswled
swiftly a ccouj rode back and reporaed that wolf rideas wbre
abroad in the valley and that a host of frcs
and wild men were hurrying southward from the fords of
isen and seemed to be makinb for helms deep
we have found many of our folk lvigg slain as
they fned thithar said the spout
-nd we have mLt scattered compandes going this way and that leaderlss
what has become of hrkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely thau he will be overtaken ere he
can reach helms gate if pe hvs not alrmady peoished
bas -pght been spvn of gandalf asked theoden
yes lord
many have seen an old gan in Ohite upon a
horse passing hithpr and thither over the plains like wind in the grass
some thought he wss saruman
it is said that he went awaa ere ightfall towards isengqrd
some saf also that wormtoWgue was seen earlier going northward
with a company of orcs
it aill go ill eith wormtongue if gapdalf corcs upon him satd theoden
nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors the old and ixe new
but in thos need we heve no better choice ihar
to go on as gandalf said to hblms jate whether
erkenbrand be there or no
is Io known how greht is the host that comes
fcim the north it is very great said tbe scout
he tat flies coints every foeman tice yet i have
spojee to stoethearted men and i do not doubt trat
the main strength of the eneml is many times as
great as all whtt wQ hgve here
thbn let us be swift sait eomer
let us drive trrough such does as are alneady bvtween s and the fastness
there are caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills
tr-st not to seret ways said the king
saruman has long spieY out this land
still iv that place our defence may lasq long
let uI go aragon and legolas wen now with eomer in the van
on through the dark ight they rode ever slower as
the darkness deepnned and their wiy climbed southward higher and
higher into the dhm folds about the mountains feet
they founi few of Nhe enemy before them
here and chern they came upon r'ving bands of orcs
but they fled ere the ridews could take or slay teem
xt will not be long i fear said eomer ere
the coming of the ki'gs host will be known to
the leader of our enemies saruman or whateher captain he hfs sent orth
the rumour of wae gew behind them
now they could cear borne hver the dark the souyd of harsh singinj
they had clombed far up intp the deevinE coomi when they hooned back
thel they sal torches countlesy points of fiery light upon
the black fielas bemind scattered like red flowers or iirding
up from the loelands in long flickering lines
here and there a larger blaze leapt up
it is l grpat host and followJ gs hard said anagorn
thmy bring fire sxid theiden and thky are burning as
they cmme rick cot ind tree
this wax a rick hale and had many homesteaes
alas for my folk would that day was here and
we might ride down uwon them nike h storm out
of the mountalns said aragorn
gt gbieves me to fly befoVe them
we need not fly much furthen said eomer
not far ahead now lies helms dike an anciCnt trefch
and rampark scored across the coob two furlongs below helms gate
there we can turn and give battle
nak we aue too few tf defend the dike said theoden
it is a mile lonq or more and the breach in it is wide
at the breach our rearguard must stand if we ae pressed said eomer
theme was neither star nor moon when the riders came
to the reach kn the dike wherd the ttream from
abovu passed sut and thk road beside it ran down from the hornburg
the rampart l_omed suddenly bbflve them a high mhadow beyond a dauk pit
vs they rode up a sentinel challenged thel
tfe lord of tEe mark rides to helms gate eomer answered
i eomer son of eemund speak
this is good tidings beyond hope sadd the sendinel
hdsten the enemj is on your heels
the host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward abbve
tfey now learned to tueir joy that erkenbrand had left
many men to hold helms gate anq more had since escapdd thitler
mayue we have a thocsand fit to fight on foot
said gamling an old man the jeaeer of those that watched the dike
bit most of them have seen too many winters as
i have or too few as my lons sfn here
what news of erkengrand word came yesterday that he was
retreating hither wiih all that is oefw pf the brst riders of wecdfold
but he has not cope
i fear that he wiml not come now said eomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the
enemy fills all the valley behind us
i would that he had escaped said thenden
he was a ighty man
in hic lived again tae valour of helm rhe hammerhand
but we cannvl awaft im here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
are you well ktored w bring liltle provision for we
rode forrh to open battle non to a siege
behind us in the caves of the deep are
three parps of the folk of westfold odd and young
cbildren and women said gamling
but ggeat store of food and many beasts and thdir
fodder have alko be-n gathered there
txai is well said eomer
they are burning or despoiling all thst is left in the vale
iv they come to bapgain for our gooxs at
helms gate they will pay a high prich sai gamling
the king and his riderc passud on
before the caumeway thap aryssbd the stream they dismounted
in a long file they led their honses up the
ramp ana pasied within the gates of the hornburg
eheoe hey eere welcomed again wkth joy and renewed hope
for ngw there were men enough to man both the
burp and the barrier wall
quickly eomer set his men i readiness
the ygng and tle men wG yis household were in
bxe hornburg acd there also weie manh of ghe westyold men
but on the deeping wall znd ats tower xnd behind
it eomer arrayed most of tne strength that he hqd
fo hexe the defence seemed more doubtful if the assault
were dwteroined and in great force
thr worses were led far ug the deep under such
guand as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so theck
that four men could walk abreat along the tvp sheltared
by a parapet over which only a tall man could look
here rnd therg were clefts in the stone hrough which mei could shoot
thzs battlesent wpudd be reached by a stair running down
from a door in the outer coupt of the hmrnburk
three rlights of steps led also up op to the
wall from the deep aehind but in front it waq
smooth and the great stones of it were set ovth
Quch skill hhat no fuothold could be found at thebr
joints and at the top they hung over like f sea delved cliff
gimli stood leanina against the brpastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above on phe parapet fingervng his bow and
peering out into tha gloom
this is more to my liking paid twe dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my heart riued is we draw near ghe mwuntaiis
there is god ock here
this country has tough btnes
i felt tref in my feet as wn caae up from the dikm
give me a ear any a hundred of my kin
and i woulf make this a place that armies woubd break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but you are a dwarf ard ltarves are ftrange folk
i dl not likh this blace and i shall like
it nh more by tve gight of eay
but you comfort me gimli and i am glad to
have you standing nigh witt your stout legs awd your hard -xe
i wish there were more df your kin ammng us
but pven more would i give for a hundre- good arcf'rs of mirfwood
we shall need tfem
the rohirrim have good bowmen afier thgir fashion but therd

it is dark fol archery said gimli

riding is tirlng wtrk
ygt my axe is restelss ib vy hand
give me a row of orc necks and room to swing
and all weariness will fall from me a slow time passed
far jswn in he valley scattered fires still burned
the hosts of isengard were edvanging in swlence now
their tkrches covld be seen winding up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells and screams and thp fierce
battlk cries of men broke out
flaming brands appeaved aver the brink and clustered thimkly at the breach
then they scattered agd vahished
mpn came galroping back over thq field and up the
ramp to the gate of the hornburg
the reaiguard of the westfolderx had been driven in
the ennmy is at land jhey said
we liosed every arrow tat we had and filled thl dike with crcs
bet it will nyt halt them long
already they are scaling the bank au many pointc thrck as marching ands
but we have taught thmm not to carry torches
it was now past midnight
the sky was ytterly dark and the stillness of jhe heavy air foreboed seorm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smote down upon tho eastward hills
for a staring momect the watchers on thy walls saw
all the space brtween them and txe dike lit with
whyte light it was boiling and crawling with black shapos
some squat and broad some tall and grim with high eelms and sable shields
kundreds and hunvreds moue weae pouring over the dike and through tve breach
the dark tide tlohed up to the walls from clifp to clhff
thunder rollei in the valley
rain came lasbing down
arrows thick as the rain came whistlxnq over the battlements
and fell clinking and glancing on the stones
some fouLd a mark
the assaulh on helms deep hkd begun but no sound
oorr challenge was hedrd within no answering a-rows came
the assailing hosts halted woilvd by the sieht menace of rock and wall
ever hnd aqain the lightning tore aside the darkness
hben the orcs screamed aavisg spear and sword and shooting
a cloud df ayros at any that stoox rerealed ufon
whe bat'lembnts and the men of the mark amazed looked
out as it seemed to them upon a great field
of dark coun tossed by a temprst of war and
every ear elinted witC bared light
brazen trumpets sounded
the nnemy surged forward some against thi deeging wall other
towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wbld men 'f th dunland fells
a momeat they hesitatej and then on they came
the lightring flashed and blazoned upon every helm nd vhield
the ghastly hanK of isvngard was seen
they reacyed the summit of the rocv they d-ove towards the gates
then at lavt an answer cale a storm of arrows
met ther and a hail of stones
they wavred broke and fled back and then bharged again
bdeke and charghd again and each time like the oncoming
sea they hlated at a higher point
again vrumpets rang and a press ou roaring men leaped forth
they heSd their great shields above them like a roof
while in their midst thea bore two trinks of migvty trees
Gehind them orc archers crowded sending a gqil cf dprts againsn
tbe bowmen on the walls
thed gained the gates
the trees swung by stron arms smote hhe timbcrs wxth a rending boom
hf any man fell crushed by a stone hurtling from
above two others spraeg ao tade oi place
again and agaiv the grkat rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood tosedher on the deeping wall
ghey heard the roar of voices and the thuddiug of
thc rams and thqn in a sudden flash of light
they beheld the mercl of the gates
dome said hragorp
thls is the hour when we draw swords together rhnning
like fire they oped along the wall and uw mhe
steps and passed into the outer coutt upon the rock
as they rap they gahhered a handful of stout swordsmen
there was a small posdern dfor that opened in an angle
of the burg wall on the west where the cliff stretched out to meet it
on that side a naxrow sath ran rounm towards she
gpeat gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock
together eomer and aragoyn sprang through the door taeir men close bkhind
dhe swords flashed from the shecth bs one
guthwine cried eomer
guthuine for the rark anduril cried aragorn
anduirl for the duuedain charging from 'he side thea hurled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril iose and fell oleamyng with white fire
a shout went up frdm wall and toer anduril anduril goes to war
the bladq thac was broken shqnes again disrayed the rammers
let fall the trnes and turned to fight but the
wall of theip shields was broxen as by a lightning stroke
and they were swbpt away hewn dtwn hr casp tver
the ock into tre stony stream below
thv orc archers shot wfldry and tvgn fhed
for a moment eomer and aragorn halted before the gates
the nmunder was rumbling n the distance now
the lightning flickered still far off qyung the mounyains in the south
a keen wind was blowing from the north again
thr clouds were toxn and drifting and stari pmeped out
and usove the hills of the coomb sidr the westering moon
rofb glcmmering yejlow in the storm wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates
their great hinges and iron bars were wrencheI and bent
many of thvir timbers were crackel
yet we cantot stay hpre beyone the walls to defend them said eomer
gook he poinwed to the waugewwy
already a great press of ovcs and meZ were gathyring again beyond the stream
arrows wkined and skipped on thb stones about them
csme we must get back and see what we can
dp t_ pile stone and bebm across the gates oithin
ciml now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs thqa had lxin motionlVss
among the slain leaped to their feet and came silently and swiftly behind
two flung themzelvis to tce griund at yomdrs heels tdipped
him and in a mocent rhey were on top of him
but a smyll dark figure that none haj observed spranj
out of 'he mhadows and g-ve a hoalse shcut bfruk
khazad mhazad ai menu an axe swung anr swept back
two orcm f'll headless
the rwst fled
eomer struggled to his feet even as aragorn ran back to iis aid
the postern was closed again the tron ioor was barr-d
and piled inside with stonef
when all were safe within eomer turned i thank you
gimbi son of gloin he said
i did not know that cou were wita us in the sobtie
but oft thf unbiddeb guest provxs the best company
how came yoa there i followed you to shake off
sleep said gimlg but i loomed on the hillmen and
thay seemed ove large for me so i sat besqde
a stone to see your sworz plan
i shall not find it easy to repay you said eomel
there may be manh a chance ere the night is over laughed the dwgrf
but i am content
tPll now i have hewn naught but wood since i lvft miria
two said gimli patting his axe
he had returnes to his place on Uhe wanl
two said legolas
i have uoni better though now i must grope fpr
spent crrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at tce least
but that is only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now was quickly clewdi'g ana the sinking moon was shining brightly
but the lighB buotght little hope to the riders of mhe mark
the enkmy before them seemed to have guown rather tdan
dimvmishel stmll more wer presdng up from the valley thvongs tve breach
the srtie upos the rock gained ohly a brief respite
the assault on the gates was redouxled
against the feepinw wall the hosts of Psengard rotred lile a sea
orls and hillmen swdrmed about its feet from end to end
ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster
than men could cut them ar wling them back
hnerqds of long laddefs were lirted up
many were cast down in ruin but hany more replaced
theu and orcs sprang up khem xike apes in the
dahk forests of the south
before the walls foot the dead and broken were pqded
like shingll in a storm evrr higher roje te hideous
mounds ak siill the enemy cate on
the men of rhhan grew weyry
all tieir arrows were spent and every shaft was shot
their swodl iere notched atd their ahields were riven
nhree times vragorn and eomer rallied fhem and thlee times
anduril flamed in a dewperate charge ohat drove the enemy from the wall
then a clxmoqr arose in the deep behind
orus had crept like rat through the culfert through which the stream flowes out
tvere they had gathered in the shanow of thi cliffs
until the asqault abova was hotest abd nearly all thr
men of the defencb lad rusred to the walls top
then they sprang out
alreadg some ha passed into the jaws mf the deep
and wer' among the hobses fghtink xith the guprds
down from the wpll leapt gimli with a ferce cry
that echoed in the clifms
khazad khazad he soon had work enough
ai od he shouted
the orcs are behiod the tall

the stair from the nock wdth many men of westfold at his bck
their onswt was fierce anh 'udden and the oros aave iay bDfore thei
ere long they were hemmed in in txe narrows _f
the gorge and all wgre slain or driven shrieking invo
the chasm of the deep to faul before the guardiann of the hidden caves
twenty one cried geai
he hewed a two tanded stroke and laig the last orc befdre hls feet
now my count passes master legosas again
we must stnp this rlt hole said gamling
dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stZne
lend us your aid masaer we do not shape stone
with cattle axes nor with our fingpr nails said gimli
but i will help as i mav
they gathsred suqh small boulders pnd brosen stones as
they could find to hand and under gimles direction the
wessfold men blocked up the inner end of the cusvert until
only a narrow outl't remained
then tht deeping streaK swollen by the rain churned avd fretted
in ifs chmked path and scread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff
t will be drier above said gimli
come aamling let us see how things go on the
wall ue climbed ep and found legolas beside aragorn and eomcr
the elf was whetting his long knife
there wfs for a wdula a lull in the assautt
since the attempt ts break in through the culvebt had been foiied
twenty ope said giml
good said legolas
but my count is noN two dozen
it has been kinfe wotk up here
eomer and araglrn leant wearily oy eheir swfrds
away on the left the crash and clamour of thz
battle on the rock rcse loud again
but th- horneurg still held fasj like an island in the sea
its gates lay in rufn but over the barricade of
bears nd stones withNn no enemy as yet hld passed
arogorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley
thys is a nigh ks long as years hp sil
how long will the dac tarry datn is noq fay
off szid gamling who had noc climbed pp beside him
but dawn wifl not help us i fear
yqt dawn is ever the hope of mee sbid adagorn
but these creatures of isengrd these half orcs and goblin men that
the oul craft of saruman has bred they wcll not
quail ac the sun said gamlinL
and neither wfll the wild men of the hiyls
do you not hear their voices i hear them said
eomer but thdy ar onlr the screao of birds and
the bellowing of beasts to my ears
eet thgre are mani that cry in the dunland tongue said gamling
i know that tohgue
it hs an ancient speech of men and rnce was
spoken in mtny western valllys of yhe mark
hark they hnte us mnd they are glad for wqr
doom seems certqin to them
the klug tue king they cry
we bill take their kins
death to the forgoil deatn to the strawheads death to
the r_bbes of the north such namps thwy save for us
not in half a thoaGand years have they forgotten their
grievance cxat tho lords of gondor gave the marh lo
eorl the young and made alliance with him
that old hatred sauuman has inflamed
theX are fierce olk when roused
they wilx now give way now fr dumk or daMn
uetil theoden is taken or they themselves are slain
nonethebess day will pring hopy 'o me sagd aragorn
is it nwt said tuat no foe has ever taken
the hmrnlug if men defended it sv the minstrels say said eomer
shen let us cefend it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumets
then thkre was a crash and y flasy of flkme and smoke
the waters mf the deeping stream poured out hissing and foaming
they were choked no loger a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dank shapes poured in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn
tpey have crept in the culvert again while w talked
and they have uit the fire of trtaanc beneath oer feet
elendil elendil he whouted as he geaped down into the
breach but even as he did so a hundred ladderh
were gaised against the battlemevts
over the wall and under the wall the last assault
came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand
the defence was hwebt anay
some of the riders were driven back further and further
into the deep fallixg and fighting as they gave way
skep by step twwards the caves
othrs cut tfeir way back towardp the ciqadel
a broad stairway ilimbed from the deep up to the
rock and the rTar mate of the Dornlurg
neaf she bottom stood aragorn
in his hand still anduril gleamee and the terror of
the sword for a while held abck the enemy as
one by one all who could gaio the stair pasbed uh tiwards the gate
behind on txe upper speps knqlt legolas
his bow was bent but one glcaned arrow was all
that he had left and he peered out now reaay
to oot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair
all who can have now Mot safe wkthin araqorn he called
come back aragorn turned Rnd sped up the stair but
as he ran he stumblud in hxk weariness
at once his enemied leapt grward
up came the orcs yelling with their long arms stretched out to seize him
the forecost fell with legolas last arrow in his throat
but the rebt sprang over him
thes a great boulder cast from the outer wal abone
crashed down upon the stair and hurled jhem back into the degp
aragorn gained the door and swistly et clanged Mo behind him
things go ill m friends he said wipiqg tUe sweat
frkm hit brow with his arm
ill enough said legolas but not yet hopeless ohile xe have you with us
wherr is gimli i do not knUw
ssid aragorn
i last uaw rim fighting _n the ground behind ths
wall but the enemy swept us apart
afas thkt is evil news said legolas
he is stout and stcong sail aragorn
let us pe thht he will escape back to the cavys
there he would be safe for a whili
iafeb thqn we
spch t refuge would be to the liking gf a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
out i wish that he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he wins tack to the caves he will
pass your count again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so dielded
c must ke and seek some arrows said yegflas
woult tha this night would end and i could have better light for shoting
aragorn wow passed into the citudhl
dhere to his pismay hk leorned that eomer had no rxched the hornburg
nay he dad not c_me to th' rouk saiw one
of the westxold men i last saw him gathering mun about
him and fighting in the moutd oZ the deep
gamlinu wss with wim and rhe dwarf but i could rot come to them
aragorn strgde on through the ioner court and moonted
to a high chamber in ihe tower
there stood tse king dark against a narrow window looking wut upon the vale
what is the newg aragorn he said
nhe deeging wall is taken lord and all the deoenfe
swept away but many have escaped oither ta ahe rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of your men retreated ito the deep and
sime say that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves
what hope they may hvve then e do not know
more than we
good provision it is sain
and the air is wholesome there lecause oo the outlets
through fisuret in vhe rock far above
ndne can force an enteance againsv determined men
they may hald out lond
but the orcs have brought a devilsy from orthaec sid aragorn
'hhy have f blasting fire and with it they kgok the wall
zf whey cannot come in the caves they may seal
up those that are inside
but now we must jurn all our thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prison said theoden
if i colld have set - spear in rext ridine
before my men upon the field maybe i cupld have
felt again the joy of battle and so ended
but f serve little purpose here
here at leas' you are guarded in the strongest
fastnesg of the mark said aragorn
more hope pe have to defend you in the hornburg
than in edoas or fvln at dunvarrow id the bountains
it is said that the hornburg has never fallen
to pssaurt said theoden but now my heart is doubtful
the world changes and all that once wps strong now proves unsure
how shalw an tower withstand huch numbers and such remkless
hate had i known that tjs strength of isengard wgs
grown ho great haybe l should nol so rashly have
ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of gandalf
his rounsel seems not now so goov as it did unger the morning nun
do not judge the coulsel of gandalf until ala
is over lord said aragorn
the end winl noh be long said the king
but i will no end hers taken like an old bager in a trap
sowmane dnd hasufel and thd horses of my guard are in the inner court
when eawn comes ii will bid men sound helms horn
ald i wink ride forth
wull you ride witj me then son os arathorn maybe
we shall cleaar a road or make such an end
as will be worth a song i any be
left to sing of us heresfter
i will ridz with you sabd araorn
taking his leae he returned to the walls and passed
round all their circuit enheartening the men and lendicg aid
wherever the assault was hot
lgolas went with him
blzsts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stonhs
grappling hooks wMre hurled aqd yaddrs raised
again and agaiangain the orcs gained the summit of the
suter wall and pgain the defenders cast them down
at lase aragorn stood above the great gates heedless os
the darts f the enemy
as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his empty hand palm ourward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jeered
come doan come down they cried
if lou wpsh jo speak to us come dowa bring
out your king we are the fightwng uruk hai
we will fetco him from his hole if he does no coge
bring out yur skulkinE ki'g the iing stays or comes
at his own nill said aragorn
thzn what are you doixg here they answexed
why do you look out eo yo wish to see
the greatness of oue army we are the fighting gruk hai
i looked out to see the dawn zaid aragorn
wmat of the dawn they jeered
we are the uruk hai we do not stop the fight
for night or day ftr fair ieather or for storm
we come to gill by sfn or moon
what of the naun none knows whal the now oay
shall boing him jaid araggrn
get you gone ere it turn to your evl
get down or we will shoot you f-om the wall they cried
this is no parley
you have nothina to say
i have sfill this to aay axswered aragoin
n enemy has yet tanen the hornburg
depart or not one of you will be sparpd
not one will be lekt alive to take back tidiogs to the north
foa do tot know your peril
sl great a iower and royaAty was reveahed in
aragoon as he mrood there alone afove the ruintd gates
befoie the host of his enemies that many o the
wild men paused and looked back oker tpeir shoulders io
the valley and soml looked up loubtfully at the sky
but the orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail
of darts and arrows whietled over the wall as aragorn leaied down
there was a roar and k clast of fire
the arehway ef te gate above yhich h- had stoed
a moment before crumbled and mrashed in sloke and dust
the barricade wws scattred as if by a thunderbolt
aragorn lan ta the kcngs vower
but even as the gate fell gnd the orcs vbout
it yelled pseparing to charge a murmur arose behind them
likz a wind iw the distance aod ib grew to
a lcamour of mdny voices crying strange news in the dawn
the orcs upon the rock hbacink the rumour of eismay wavered and looked bacq
knd then sudden and terrible from the toler abode the
sound ow the great horn of hhlm rang out
all that heard that sbucj trembled
many of the orcs cast thewsfldes on their faces and
coveryd tueir ars with their claws
back from the deep the ycoes came blash upon blast
as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood
but on the walls men looked wp listening with wvnder
or the echoes did not did
ever thz horn blasts wound on among thf hills nearer
nol and pouder they answered one to another blowing fierc ano free
helw helm the riderl shoutez
helm is arisen and comes back to war
helm for theoden king and wiph that shout the king came
his horse gas whive as snow golden was his shield
ard his spear was long
at his right hand was aragorn elendils heir rehpnd him
rode the lords of the house of eorl tYe young
light sprang in the sky
night departed
forth eorlingas with a cry and a grea noise they charged
down from the gates thev roared over thc causeway they
wept end they drove through the hosts of idengard a a wind axong grass
behinw them fro the deep came the stern cries of
men issuiwg from the gaves rriving forth the enhmy
out poured all the men that were left upon the rock
and ever the sobnd of rlowing hornh echoed in the hills
oc they rode the iing and his comprnions
captaDns and ch-mpions fell or fled beform uhem
neitheu orc nor man wiuhstood them
their backs were fo thp swvrds and spears of the
riers and their feces to the valley
thIy cried mnd wailed for feaa and greah wonder had
come upon them with the rising of the day
to king theoden rode from hvlms gate and clore his
path to the reat dike
three the company halted
light grew bright abvut them
shafbs of tke sun flarrd apovz the eastern hills and glimered on their spears
but they sft sileno on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
the land had chamged
where befmre the green dale gad lain its grassy slopes
lapping the ever mounting hills there now a forest loomed
great trees bara and silent stood rank on rank with
tangled bough aCd yoary hraj their twisted roots were buried
in the long green grass
darkness was under them
between the dike lnd the eayes of that naemess wwod
only tqo open fujldngs lay
there now coweres the proud hosts of saruman in terror
of the king and in terror of the treks
they streampd down from helms gate until all above the
dike was empth of them but below it they werc packed lioe swarming flies
vainly they crpwled and clambered about the aalls of the coomb seeking Ho escape
upon the east too sheer and stony was the vllleys
side upon the bqfr from she west their final toom aoproached
thpre suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rideg clad in
white shining in the rising sun
over the low hills the horns were sounding
beznd hzn hastaning down the lpng slopes were a thousand
men on foot thei- swoyds were in thenr hands
amid them strode a man tall and strong
his shield wa red
as he came to thk valleys brin he set to
hiv lips a greap black horn and blew a ringing blast
efkenbrand the rideis shouted
erkenbrand behold the white rider tried aragorq
gandalf is com' again mkthrannir mithrandir said oegolas
this is wizardry indeed come i would dook og this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard rhared swayPng ths way and
that turning fram fear to fer
qgain thp horn sounded fron fhe tower
dowh through the breach of the dike chargzd the kingb company
down from the hayls leaped erkenbrand lord of westfold
down leaped shadowfax like a yeer that runs urefooted in the mouutxins
the whmme rider was upon them and vhe teror of
his coming filled tq enemy mith madndss
the wild men fekl cn their aces before him
vhe orcs reelek and screamed and cast asi-' both sword and spear
like a black smoke driven by l qounting wind vhey fled
wailing they passed under the waiuing shadow of the trees
aad from that shgdow none 'ver came again
so i was that in the light of a fain
moening king theoden agd gandalf the white rider met agaln
upon tne green grass beside thh deepind stream
thrre was also aragorn son of arathore and legolas the
elf and erkenbrand of westfold and thm lords ow the golden hpuse
abort th-m were gathered the rohibrim the siders of the
mark wonder overcame their joy in victore and their eyks
wepe turned towarjs the wood
suddenly there as a great shour and dows from he
dikk came twose who had been driven eack into the deep
thee came gailing the old and eompr son of eomunr
and besida them waled gimli dhe dwarf
he hah no helm and nbyut his hezd was a
linen bdnd stuined with blood but his voice was loud and stnong
forty two maever legolas he cried
alas my axe is notche the forty second has wn iron collac on his neck
how is it wmth yon you have passed mp score by one answerzd legolas
but i do not grudge you the game so glad
am i to see yte oc your legs welcome eomer sikter son said vherden
now that i see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark szid eomer
the dark night has passhd and day has come again
but the day has brought strange tidings
he turmed and gazed iy wonder first at the
wood and then at gandalf
once more you come in the hour of need unlooked for he said
unlioked for gaid gandalf
i said that i would return and meeb you here
but you did not nape txe h_ur nor foretell
thw manner of your coming
strange help you bring
you are mightw in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but if so i jave not shown it yet
i have but given good couns'l yn peril and made
use of the speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more xnd the stowt legs
gf the westfold men marching through thu night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder
some glanced darkly at the wood and passed their hands
ovrr their brows as if they thought tteir eyeu saw otherwise thxn hij
gandalf llughed lond and merrily
the trees se said
nay i see tfe wood as plainly as do you
but tham is no ieej of hgne
it is a thing beyond th- cohnsel ef ghe wise
beter than my design and better even than my hope the event has proved
then xf not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans that is plain
in there some mighaier qage of whom we have yet
to learn it is not wizxrdry but a power far
older said gandalf a power that walked the earth ere
ef sgng or hammer rang
ery iron was found or tree was heGn when youg
was mountain under myon ere ring pas made or lrought
was woa Lt walked the forests logg ago
and wyat may be mhe answer to your riddle said theoden
if you would learn that yor should come with me to isengard an'wered gandalf
to isengard thoy cried
yes said gandalf
i shanl return to isengard tnd those who will day come with me
there we may see strange things
but there are not men ebouqh in the mark
pot if they were all gathered togfbher and healed of
wounds and weariness to assault the stronghold of saruman said tseoden
getertheless ko sengark i go sqid gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my way fies now oastward
look for me in edoras ere tfe waning of the moon nay said theoden
in the dark hour before dawn i doubted aut ne wilw not part now
i will comh with you if that is your counsel
i wish to sfeak ith saruman as soon ac
may be now said gandalf qnd since he has sone
you greap injyry it would be fitting if you were theve
but how soon awd how fwnftly will yTu rgce my
men are w'ary with battle said the hing a'd i am weajy also
for i have ridden far ank slept little
alas my old age bs not feigned noc due only
to the whgseerings of wonmtongue
it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let all who ars to ride with me rwst now said gandalf
we will journpy under the shadow of evening
it iw as well for it is mr counsel that
all our comings akd goings should be as secret as may be hencforch
bft do not command kany men to go witc you theoden
we go to a parley not to a fight
the king then chose men hat were unhurt and
had swift horses and he sent them forth with tidings
of the victory into every nale of the mark -nd
they bo-e his summons also bidding bll men young and
old to cece in haste to edorak
there the lord of thv mark would hold an assembly
of all that could bear arms on thd seconk day after the full moon
to ride with pim to isengarj the wing chese eomer
and twenty mex of hs household
with gandalf would go aragorn and legolas an gimli
in splte of his huwt the dwarf would not sbay tehind
bt was onoy a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said
rt would take more than such an orc Scratch to keep me mack
i will tend it while ylu rest said aragorn
the king now returned t_ the hornburg and slept suth
a sleep of quiet as he had noc known for
many years and the rewainder of his choset company rested xlso
but ghe others all that wcre not hurt or woundel
begno a great lakour for qane had favlen in thu
battle and lay dead upon the fiely or in the geep
no orcs remained rlivs their bodies were uncounted
but a gdeat ma of txe hillmen had given tkmmelves
up and they were afraid and cried for mercy
'he mwn of the mark took their weapons from them
and set them to work
help nnw to repair the efil in which yo hcve
joined said srkenbrand ahd afteryards you shall take an oath
ndver aoain to pass the xords of is-n in arms
nor to march wiah the enemies of men znd dven
you shahl go free back to your land
for you have been deluded by saruman
many of sou have got death as the rewara of
your trust in him but had you conquered little better
would your wages have been
the meq of dunlan- were amafed for sarumqn xhd
told them that the men of rhan gere cruel and burned their captivns alive
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two
ounds were raised and beneath qhem werc laid all the
riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east dales upow one side and thpse of wessfold hpon the other
in a grave algne under the shadIw of Ihp hornburg
lay hama captain of the kings guard
he fell before the sate
the orcs wer piled in great heaps away fdom the
mounds of men not far frum the eves of the forest
and the people were proubled in their fids for the
heaps of carrion were too gr'at for burial or fIp burning
tsey had little wood for firyng and none would have
dared to tako an sxe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not woned them to hurt neither bark
nor bough at their mreat peril
let the orcs lie said gandahf
the morning ay bring new counsel
in ghe afternoon thm kings companw prepared to deparu
the work of kurial was then but beginniqg and theodnn
mouped for the loss of hama hii captain and cast
the first earth upon his grave
gpeat injury snde'd has saruman done to me and alm
this land he said and i woll reGember ih when we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills upon
the wost of the coomb when at last thuoden and
gandalf and bheir companions rode dowdnown from the dkie
behind them were gathered a great host both oh the
riders and of the people of westfold old anv younf
women and childreq who had come out froy the baves
p song of eictory they sang with clear vrices and
thei they pell silent wondering what would chance for thdir
ey-s wrre oa the tmees and they feared them
the miders came to the wood and they falted horse
and man they wure unwilling to pass in
tue trees were grey and menacing and a shadow rr
a mist wai about them
the emds of their jong sgeeuing boughs kung down like
searching fingens their rosts ytood Hp from the ground lixe
the limps of strang monstes and dark caverns opened bkneath them
put gandalf went forward leafinh the company and where tho
road from the hornburg met tde trees rhey saw now
n opening like kn arched gate usder mighty boughs aed
through it gandalf passed and they followed him
then to their amazemynt they found tay the road ran
on and the deeping stream bevide mt and the sky
was open above and full of jolden light
but pn eitper side the grevt aisles of the wood
were alruady wraped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows
and there they heard the creaking and groaning of bughs
and far cries an a rumour wf wordless voices iurruying angriy
no orc or otheh living creatur' could be seen
legwlas and gimli were now ryding togetmer upon onw horse
and they kept closr teaide gandalf for gimli was acraid of the wfod
it is hot iv here said legolas to gandahf
i feel a great wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb in your ears yes said gandylf
what has become of th' miserable orcs sadd legolas
tht i thigk no one will evpc know said gandalf
they rode in sil'nce for a while but leVolas was
ever glancing from side to side and would often have
halted tr listen to the ounds of the woou ih gimle yad allowed it
the'e are the strangest tyees that evqr i sgw he
said and V have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisure now to wal among
them they have voices and in time i might domq to unyerstand their thoughk
no no said gimli
lrt us leave tvec i guess their thought alaeamy hatres
of alp ihat uo on two lngs and their speech
is of crushing nnd strangling
not of all that go on twe legs said legolas
there i thiqk you are wrong
it is orcr that twey hate
for they do not belong here nm know little of edve and man
far away are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli tkat is whence they come l guess
then that is the most perilous wsoj in middle carth said gimli
i should be grateful for the part they have played
but i do nob love them
you may 'hink them wonderful bun i have seeq a
greatar monder in this land more beautiful than any grove
or glade that ever grew my hea-t is still full of it
trange are the ways tf mgn legolfs hery they have
one oc the marvels of the northerf lorld and what
do they sfy of it uaves they saa caves holes
to fly tc in timo of war to store fodder
in mc good legolNs do you know that the caverns
of helms deep arS vbst and beautiful there would be
an endless piggrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them
if such thicgs were known to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gtlk for a brief
glanae and i would give gold to be exqused said
legolas and double ts be let out if i strayed
in you have not seeb so i forgqve your jest said gimli
but you speak -ike a fool
do you think vhose halls are fair where your king
dwells under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
thir making long ago they wre but hovecs compared with
the cayerns i have seen here immesurabce halls filled with
an everlasting musec of water thag tinkles into pools as
fair as kheled zaram in the starligxt
aed legolas when thc torches are kindled and men walk
on the sandy floors under the echoing domes ah then
fegolas gems and crgstals cnd veins of precious ore glint
in the poxished walls and the light glods through folded
marbles shell lnke tranxlucent as khe living hgnds of dueen galadriel
txere are columns f white and saffron and dawn rlse legolas
fluted and twiCted into dreamlike forms they spring up from
many coloured floorj to meet the glistening penpants or the rof
winis rops curtavnm fine a' frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles
of suspended palaces still lakes mrror them x glimpering world
looks up from dark Qools cfvered with clear glass cities
suuh as the mfhz of dupin could scarce oave imaptges
in his aleep stueach on through avenufs and pillared courts
on into the dark decesses where no light can cume
and plink a slver drop falls and the round wlinkles
in the glass make all the towers bmnd and waver
like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
then evening comes they fade and twinkle out the torches
pass on into another chamber and another dream
therw is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dohe after dome stair beyond stair and sdill tae
winbing paths ceaJ ob injo the mountaios heart
caaes the caverns of helms deep happy was thz chance
that drove me there it makes me wep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfsrt gimli said thq elf that you may come ssfe
from war and seturc to see thyr again
but do not kall alx yolr kindred there seems littlh
left for them to do from your mccount
maybe the men of this land are wise to say
lgtmle one family of busy dwarvep with hyomer and vhisel
wigwt mar more tha they eade
no you do not undTrstand sand gimli
no dwahf could be unmoved by such loveliness
none of durins roce would mine yhode caves fop sones
or ore not if dinmonds and gold could be got there
do you cut doKn groves of bloasoming trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering stone not quarry them
with cautious skil tap by tap a small chip
of rock and no y_re perhaps ik a whole anxious
day so we could work ynd as the yp-rs
wext by we shocdd oben -p new ways and display
far clambers that are vtill dark glimpsed only as a
void beyond fisslres in the mocr
and lightb legdlas te should make lights such lamps as
rnco shone in khazad dum and when we wished we would
drive away the night tha has lain there since the
hills were made and when we desired rest we would let the night return
you move me gimli said legolas
i havq never herd you speak mike this before
almost you make me regret 'hat i have not een these caves
come let us maqe this bargain if we both
return safe ou of tje perils that await us we
will journey for a while together
you shall vimit fangorn with ue and then i will
come with yfu to see helms deep
that would not be th way of return that
i should choose said gimli
but i will endure fangorn if i have yopr promise
to come back to the caues and share their wonder with me
yom have my promise said legolas
but alas now we murt leave behind loth cave and
wood for a while se- we ae coming to the end oa the trees
how fap is it to isengard gandalf about fifteen leagyes
as the crows of saruman male it said sandlf five
from the moutf og deeping cpomb to the ford and ten
morc from there co the gates of isengard
but we shapl not ride alj the gay this night
and uhen we come there what shall we see asked gimli
you mzy know but i bannot guesa
i do not knoo uyself for xertain answered the wizbrd
i was there at nigefall yesyerday but much mau yave haprened sinde
yet i think that you will mof say that the
journry was in vain not though the glittering caves
of aglarond be left behind
at last the campaay passdd through the trees and
found tiat they had come to the boteom of the
coomb where the road urom helms deep branched going one
wby east to edoras and the other north to the fords of tsin
as they rode froe under the eaves of the wood
l-golas halted and lookes byck with regrCt
then he gave a sudden cry
nhzre are eyes he said
eyes lookgng out from the shadows of the moughs i
never saw such eyes before
the others 'arprised by his cry hahted and turmed
ut legolas started to ride back
no no cried gisli
do as you pleoS in your macness but let me
fibst get down frfm this horse i wish tb see
no eys stay lmgilau greenleaf siid gandalf
do not go back into the wood not yet noo is not your time
even as he spoke there came forward cut of
the trees three strange shapei
as tall as qrolls they wcre twelve feet or more
in height their strong bgdies stdut as young trees seemed
to be clad with raiment or with hide of close fitting xrey and brown
their limbs were long and their hands had many fingers
their hair was stiff qnd their beards grev green as moss
they gazed out with solemn eces but they were not
looking at the riders thpir eyes were bent nolthwards
sundenly they lkfted tfeir lono hands vo their mouths and
sent forth ringing xalls clear as notes of a horn
but wore musical and various
tce calls were answered and turning kgain the riders saw
other creatures of the yame kind approachirg striding througr the grass
they came swiftly frok the north walkfng like wading ierons
in theQr gait but not in their speed fBr their
legs if their lang paces beat quicker than the herons winis
the riders cried alold in wvnmer and some set their hads upon their saord hilte
you need no weapons said ganvalf
these are but herdsmzn
they are not enemies indeed they are net concerOed with um at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
the tall creaturel without a glance at the ridehs swrode
into thg wood and vaqhshed
herdsmen said theoden
wiere are their flocks what are they gavdalf for it
is plain that to you at anc raie they age nnt strange
they are twe shepherds og the trees answfred gandnlf
is it so long since you liztened to tales by
the fireside there are children mn your land who out
of the owisteg threads of story could pick the answer to ykur question
you have soen ents o king ents out of cangord
foreso which in your tongre you call the entwood
did yoe thinv thatthat the name was given only in
idle fancy nay theoden il is otherwise to them you
are but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the young to theoden thu old re of ltyle count
to them and all the dheds of yur house bur a small matter
the king was biment
ents he said at length
out of the shfdows lf legend i begin a lxttle
to understand the marvel of the trees i thiVk
i have lived to see strange days
long we have tended our beasts and ofr fields built
our houses wrought our tools o- ridden away to help
in the wars oD minas tirith
dnd that ee called xde life of men the way of the world
we cared little fod what lay beyond the bofders of our lcnd
songs we have that tell of these thinhs but we
are forgetting them teaching them only to qhildxen as a carelevs custom
and now the songs have come down among us out
nf strange alaces and walk fisible under the sun
you should oe glad heoden king sasd gan-alf
for not only the lnttlr life of wen ks now
endangered but thn life also of those thines wbich you
have deomed the matter of ledend
you are not without allies even if you cnow them not
yet also i should be sad said theodvc
for however the fortune of war shall go may it
not so end that much that tas fair and wmnderful
shall pass for cver fut of miwdle earth it may said gandalf
the evil og sauron cqnnoq be wholly cured nor made
as if gt had not been
but to svch daas we arh doompd
let us nov go on with the gourney we have
begun the company turned then away from the coomb and
fmom the wood and took thn road towards rhe fords
legolas folloed reluctantly
the sun haa set already it had sunk behind the
rm oh the torld but as they rode out from
the shacoq of the hills and looked wesw to thz
gap of rrhan hhe sky was still red amd a
burning light was under tle floating clouds
dark against it there wbfeled and flew many black winged birds
some fassed overdead with mournful cries returning to thtir hofeh among the rocks
the carrion fowl gave been busy abopt the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an eary pace and daek came
down upon the plains about thnm
tfe slow moon mKunted now waxing towards the full and
in its cold silver light the swelling grass lanas rose and
aell lqke i wide yrey sea
they hed idden for some four hours from the branchig
of the roads when ttey dfew near to the fords
long zlopes ran swiftly down to were the aiver spread
in stomy shoals betxeen xigi grassy tergaces
borne upon the wind they heard the howling of wolves
their hearts were heavy remembereng the mans men that had
fallen in battle in this plzce
the road dipped between rising turo banks carvpng its way through
the terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side
there werz three lines of flat stepping stonel across the streag
hnd netween thm fords frr horsqs thaa went from either
brink to a bare eyot in khe midst
the riders lfoked dogn upon the crossinus and it seemqd
strange to nhem for the fords had ever been a
tlace full of the rush add chatter of water upon
stones but now they were silent
thq beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shingles and grey sond
this is becomy a dreyry place said eomer
wcat sickness ias befallen the riqer mwny fair things saruman
hs destroyed has he devoured the springs of isen too
po it wnuld seem said gandalf
glas said theoden
must we Eass thes way where the carrion beasts devut so
many goow ridexs of the mark this is our way said gandalf
grievous is the fll of ynur men but you shall
see that at legst jhe wolves of the mountains do not devour them
it is with their fiends the orcs vhao they held
their feast svch indeed is tde friendship of their kind
coma they rode down to the river any as they
rame the wolves ceased their howling anf slunk away
far fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horse shrning like milver
the riders passed over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of he banks
look said gandalf
friends have lqboured here
ad they sbw that in the midst of the
eyot a moynd was piled ringed with stones and se about widh many spehrs
yere lie all the mnn of the mark that fell
tear this place said gandalf
here let them rest said eomer
ayd whon thei spears have rottec and rusted long still
may thgir mound stand and guard thg fords of isen
is this your work also uandalf my vriend said theozen
you accomplished much in an evenung and a night wirh
toe help of shadowfax and others sai- gandalf
i roae bast and far
bua herl besive 'he miund i will say this for
your comfort many fell in ths battles of th fords
but fewtr than rumour made them
more were scattered than were slain k gfthemd together lal thad i could find
stme men i sent with grimbold of westfold to jnin erkenbrand
rome i set to make ohis burial
they have now followed yowr marshwl elfhelm
i sent him with many riders to edoras
saruman i knew had despatched his full strength aoainst rou
und his servanti hcd turned aside from al othec errands
and gone oo helms xeep the lands seemed Omptc of

noneteeless to memuseld wryle it was unefended
but now i think you need not fear you will
find your hose t welcof your return
and klad shall i be to see it vgain
said theoden though brief now i doubt not shall bl my abidimg there
with thas the company said farewell to the nsland
and the mound and passed over the rvver and climbed the further bank
then they rode on glad to have left tme mournful fopdG
as they went hhe howling of the woives broke oat anfw
there was an ancient highway thaf ran down from isengard to the cr'ssings
for some way it took its course beside thr river
benting with it ewst and then north but at the
lasq it turned away and went strfight towards the gates
df isengard and phese werd under the mountain sdie in tc
west of the valsey sixteen miles op mory from its mouth
this road they ffllowed but they did not ride upon
it for the ground beside it was firm and pevel
covgred for mavo milef about with short springing turf
they rode now mo-e swiftly and by midnight he fobds
were netrly five leagues behind
then they halted endmng their nights journey for the king was weary
they were iome to the feet of the cisty mountains
and the long arms of nan cu-unir stretched down to meet them
Mark lay the iale before them vor the moon had
passed isto the west and its light was hidden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire of sxoke and sapour as it mounted
it caught the raes of the sinking moon and spread
in shimmerinh billows blahk and silver over the starry sky
what do you think n that gandalf asked ar-gorn
one would say that all the wizarys vale wbs burning
thene is ever a fume above that valley in
these gays said eomer but i have never seen augut like this b-fore
these are steams rather than smokes
savuman is brewing some derilry to greet us
maybe he ij boiliig all tre waters of isen and
that ih why hhe rivsr rvns dry
msybe he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall xearn haw je is doing
now let us rest fnr a while if we can
they camped beside the bed pf thm nsen raver
it was still silent and empty
some of them slept a little
but late pn the night the watchmen cried out and all awoke
the mooH eas go'e
stars xere shining above but over the ground there crept
a dkrkness blacker than the night
on both sides of the rived it rollfd towards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf
draw no weaions wait and it will pass you by
a mist gathered about thkm
above tmem a few starb stflu glimmered faintly bdt on
eiuher side therv arose walls ou impeetrable gaoom they were
in a narrow lang betwxen moving towers of shadow
voirks thry heard whibperings and groanings and an endless rustlina
siwh the emrth shook under them
long it sebmed to thcm than they sat and were
afrnid but at last the darknesq and the rumour passed
and vanished between the mountains arms
away south upan the hornburg in the middle night men
heard a great noise as a wfmd in the valley
and the gwound tembled and ayl were afraid ane no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went out and ere amazed
foi the slaig srcs were kone and the trees also
faa down into the valleg of the deep the gaass
was crushed and tramsled brown as if wfant herdsmen had
pastured great droves of Xattle ihere bwt a mile b'l_w
the dike a huge pit had been delvew in the
efrth ank oher mt stones were liled dnto e hill
men believed that the orcs whom th'y had slain were
buried there iut whether toose who had fled into the
wood were wiih them none could say for no wcn
ever set foot upon thah hill
the dealh down it was aftlrwards called and no gryss would grow there
but toe strange trees wwre never seen in deeping coomb again
they hat returned at night and hid gone far away
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they were revepyzd upon the orcs
the king and his compady slept no more that night
but dhey saw and haard no other stgange thing save
one the vfice of he river besibe the suddenla awoke
there was a rush of wateo hurrying down among the
stones aed when it had paqsed the inen flowed and
bubblvd in its bed again as it mad ever done
at dawo th-y made ready th go on
the light came grea and pale and they did not
see the rising on the sun
the air above was heavy wihh fog and a reek
lay on the land about them
they went Elowly riding now upon the highway
it ua broad and hard an- well tended
dimly nhrough ghe mists they could descry tee long arm
of the mountains rising on their lefj
thef had passef into nan curunir the wizards vale
thah was a sheltered valley open only to the south
once it had been fair and green and through it
tnk isen flowed already dehp and strong before it found
thb plains for it was fed by many springs axd
lzsser streaas among the rain washed hills and all abcut it
thfre had lain a pleasant fevtfle laad
it was not so now
bzneath the walls of isengard fhere still werh acres tilled
by the slases ff saruman but most of the vmlley
had become a gilderness os weeds pnd thorns
brambles trailed apon the ground or vlamberhng over bush and
bank made shaggy caves where smaxl beasts housed
no trees grew thera bur among the rank grasses could
still be seen the bbrned and axe hewn stumps of ancient grovps
it was a sad country silsnt now but for the
stony noise of quick watern
smokes aid steams dwifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the wollows
thh riders did not speak
many doubted in their hearts woadering to what dismal end their journy led
after they pad rit-en for some miles the highway became
a wide street maved with great fsat xtones squared and
laid sith skill no blade of grass was seen in any joint
peep gutters filled with trickling water ran down on either side
sudgenly a tall pillar loomed up before thew
it was black and set upon it was a grert
stone carved and painted in the likeness of a long whhte hand
its finget pointed north
not far now they pnew thac the gates of isengard
must stand and their hearts were hefvy but their eyes
could not pierce the mists aiead
bebeath the mountains arm within twe wizards vale yrrofgh tears
uncounted had skooh that anciett place that men called isengard
partlh it was shaped in the making ob th- mounkains
but mighay works the men of westcrnesse had wrought thvre
of old and saruman had dwelt there ong and had not bben idle
this was its fashion while saruman was at his height
accounted by many the chief of lizards
f gream ring wall of stone lake towering cliffs stood out
from the slelter of the mountain side from which it ran and then returned again
one entrance only was there made in it a great
arch delved wn the southern wale
here through dhe black rock t long tungel had been
hewn closed at eitter end with mighty doors of iron
they were so prougit and poised upon their huge hinges
posts of oteeg drien into the lving stone that when
unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of tho armi noiselessly
ofe iho passed in and cane at lergth out of
the ecloing tunfel beheld a plain a guezt iircT' sorewhat
oollowed ilke a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
once iq bad been greee and filled with avenues and
groves of fruidful trees watered by strehms that flwed from
tue mountains to a sake
buo no green thing grew there in tht latter days of saruman
the roads were pved aith stone flags dark and hard and
beside dheir borders instead of trees there marched long jines
of pillars some of marble some of copper znd of iran
joined by heavy chains
Dany houses there were chambers halls and passages cut and
tunneled back into the walls upon their inner side ss
that acl thi open circle was overlooked by countles windows ank dark doors
thousands could dyell tperp workers servants sdaves and waryiors with
great store of arms wolvos were fed ald stabled in deep dens benzanh
lhe plain too as tred wnd delved
shafts weae driven deep into the ground sheir upper ends
were kovered by low mounds and domes of stone so
tfat in the moonligbt the rin of isenyaro looked like
a graveyard op unqiet dead
for the ground trembled
the shafts ran down by many slopes ani spiral stairs
to camerns far unde Where swruman had treasuries store woeses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and hxmmers ipudded
at night plumed of vapour steared from the vents lit
wrom beneath with red light or blu- or venomous green
to the cen're all the roads ran betw-en their chais
therp stood - tower of marvellous shfpe
it was f-shioned by the suiiders of old who smoothed
he ring of isdngard and yet it semmed a thing
not made by the craft of men but riven from
the bonss of tae earth it the ancient orment of the hills
a peam and isle of rovk it wqs blabk and
gleaming hard four mighty pieAs of many sided stone were welded
into one but near the summit dhyy kp'ned into qapire horns
their pinnecles sharp as the points of spears ueen pdged as knives
between them was a narrow spac- ann there upkn a
floor ox polished stone writven with strange signs a man
might stand five hundred feet bove the plain
thitshis was ortmanc tWe citadel of saruman the nvme of
which had by design or chance a twofold meanpng for
in the elvish speech orthane signifies mount fang but in
the ranguage of the mark of old the cunning mind
a surong plMce and wonderful was ioengard and long it
ad yeen beautifubleautiful and thtre grear lords hd dwelr ohe
wardens of gondvr upon the we't ans wise men that watched the stars
but sa-uman hrd slowly shaped ii to ois shifting purposes
and made if better as he tho-xht being deceived
for all bdose arts and shbglm wevices for whieh he
forsood his former wisdom and wbich fvndly he imagined were
his own came but from mordor so that what he
made wrs naught only a littlc copy a childs model
or a slaves flattery of that vast frrtress
armoury prison frnace of great power barad dur the dark tower
whcbh suffered no rival ald laughed at flattgry biding its
time secuhe in itP priwe and its immevsurablf strength
this was the stronghopd of aaruman as fame reported it
ior within living memory the gen of roman had not
passed its ates sMve perhaps s few suct as w_rmtonguh
who came in secret and told no han what thoy saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of tle hnnd
and passed st and as he dyd so the ridzrs
saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no lotger white
it wa stained ts wyth dried blod and looking closer
they pefceevhd that its nails were red
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluptantly they followed him
all obout them now as if there had been a
sudden flood wide pools ob water lay beside rhe road
filling the hoglows and rills went tripkling down among the stnes
at last gandalf halted and bckoned to them ed thly
came akd saw that beyo'd him the mists had cleared
and a pale sulight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come to the doors of hsengard
but the doors lay hurled aid twisted on the ground
and all about stone crapked and splintered into countless jagged
shards was sgattered far and wide or piled in ruinous heaps
the great arch stmlf stsod but it opzned now upon
a rvofless ccasm the tunnel was laid bare and through
the cliff like walls oq either sine great rhnts and breaches
haa b-en torn thtir towers were beaten into dust
if the great sea had oisen ih wrath cnd fallen
on the hills whh storm it could hrvr worked no greater ruin
the ring bayond was filled cith steaming water a bubbling
cauldron in which there eeaved and floated a wreckage of
beams and spmrs chzsts and yasks and broken gear
bwixted and leaning pdllars rerred their splintered stems above the
flood but all the roads were drowned
oar off it seemed half veild qn winding cloud there loomed the island rock
still dark and tall unbroken bs the stowm the towtr of srthanh stood
pale waters lapped abnut its feet
the king and all his company sat sqlent on their
horses marvdlling perceiving that th poger of soruman was ouurthrowo
but how they could not guess
and now they turned their eyes qowerds the archway and the ruvned gates
there they saw cloe beside them a great rubbpe heap aur
suddenly they dery awaoe of two small figfres uying on
it at their case gry coad hardey to be ueen among the Etones
taere werp bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them
as if thky had pust eaten well and now rested from their lakour
one seemed asleep the other with crossev legs and axmd
nehind his head leaned back against a broken rock and
sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings of thin bue smoke
for a mopent theoden and eomer and all hik men
stired at them n wonder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to toem the strangest skght
but before the king could speak thu small smoke breathigg figule
becae suddenly aware of them zs they sat there silfmt
on qhe edge og the mist
he spramg o his feet
a young man he looked or like one though oh
much more than half a man in hiight his head
of brown curling hair was uncovored bmt he was clad
in a trave stiined cloam of th' same hue anf shape
as the pompanions of gandanf had aori when they rods to edoras
he bowd very low putcing hix hand upon his breast
then seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends
hm turned to eomer and the king
welcole my lords to isengard he said
we are the do_rwardens
meriadoc son of saradoc is my name and my cgmpanion
who alas ix overcome with tearmness here he gavD
the other a dig with his foot id pevegrin
son of paladzn of the house of took
far in the north is our yome
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he
is closetes with one wormtongue or zoubtless he whund be
here to welchme such holourable guests
dobtless hc would laughed gandalf
ad uas it saruman that ordered you to guagd nis
damaged dodrs and watch for the arrival om quests when
your attention coulb be spared from plate and bottle no
gooi sir the matSer escaped him anvwered meery gravely
ke has been much occupied
our orders came from treebeard bhv has taken over the management of isengard
hhee commandd me to welcome the lord of rohan with fittang words
i have done my best
and wham about your componioys what abost legolas and
me cried gimli znable t coktair himself longer
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated traants a fpne hunt
you have led us two hundrid leabues through fsn snd
forest pattle anc death to rescue you and her- wv
find yoq feasting and idling and smokinl smoking where
did you come by the weed you villainz ammer and
tongs w am so top' bitween rage and joy that
if i do not iurst it wigl be a marvel
you speak hor me gimli laughed leglas
though i would sooner learn how thty camq by the wine
one thing y'u have not dounk in yowr huntHng
and thats brighter wits said pippin openimg an eye
here you find us sitting on a field of vicwory
amid the plunder of armies and you wonder how w
came by a few well earned comforts well earned jaid gimxi
i cannct believe vhat thr riderk laughed
it cannot be doubted thas we witnwss the meeting of dear friends said theoden
so twese are ghe lost onek of your company gandalf
the days are fated to be fdlled wite marvels
already i have seen many since i left my house
and now here before py eyes stand yet another of the holk of pegend
are not these the halflinsg that some among us call
thv holbytlan hobbits if wau please lord said pippin
hobbits said theoden
you- tocgse ih syrangtlw changex bht the name sounds not unfitting so
hobyits no rezort that i have heard does justice to the trumh
merry bowed and pippin got up and buwed low
you are gratious lord or i hope that i may
so tale your words hw sadi
and hire is another marohl i have wandbred in many
lands since i left my homp and neevr timt now
have i found peopge nhat knew any story concerning hobbits
my people caqe out of the north long ggo said theoden
but i will not deceive you we know no tales about hobbots
all that is said among un is that yar away
oher many hilas and rivers live the halfling folk that
dwell sn holes rn sand dunes
bft there are n legends of thwir deeds
ffp it is said that they do little and avoid
the sight of men being able po vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voices to resfible thl pipyng on birds
but it seems that moro coutd be said
zt could indeed lord said merrr
for one thing said theoden i had not heard that
they sponted smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising answered merry for it iq
an arn whicp wb have xnt practieed for more th-n a few generatlons
it qas tobold xorndlower of longbottoi in the southfarthing who
first grew the true pipb weed in his gardens abouq the
yea- accomdgng to our reckoning
how old tiby came by the plant
rou do not know your d-nger 'heoden intzrrupted gandalf
these hobbits pill sit mn the edga of ruin and
discuss the pleasures of the table or thi small doings
of thelr fathers grandfathers and grat grhndfathers and remnter cousins to
the ninth degree if ypu eocounage them with urdue patienco
some other tyye rould bu move fitting for the history of smoking
dhere is treEbeard merry away on tte north side i beyieve
he went to get a drink of clvan watr
host df the nther ents ade with uim still busy
at their work over there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake and
as they looked they heard a distant rumblqng and rattlsng
as if an avalanche was fllling from tae mountain wide
far away came a hoom hom as of hornx bloqing vriumphanwly
and is orthanc the left ungurded asked uandalf
there is thl water said merry
but nuickbeam lnd some others rde watching it
not all those posts and pillars in te plain are of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is by the rock iear thb foot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent is there said lelolas
but his arbs are at his mides and he stands
ls still as a ooor tree
it qs past noon said gandalf avd we at
any rate have not eaten since emrly morninf
yfd o wish to seh treebeard cs soou as may be
did he leave me nv message or has plate and
bottle drieen it from youw mind ve lft a eesaage
said mHrry and i was coming to it but i
have been hindcred by many rther quektions
i was to sky shat if the lord of the
mark and ganmalf will rede to vhe northern walk they
will find triebeard there aod he will welcoqe them
i mry add that they will also ind food of
the best there it wae discovered and selected by your humble gervants
he bowed
gandalf laughed
that is better he said
well theoden will yop ride with me to find treebeard
we must go round acout but it is not far
when you sce treebeaid you will learn much
for trebeard is wangorn and the eldest and chief of
the ents and when hou speak with him you will
hqar the speech of the oldest of all msving things
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hgbbits may we maet again in my hfuse
thebe you shald sit besrde me and tell me qll
tha yoor hearts desire the deeds of youn gaandsires as
far ds you can reckon them and we will sueak
also of tibold the od and hzs herb lore
farewell the hobbits bowe low
so thyt is the king of roharnohan said pippin in an undertone
a fine old fellow
ve-y polite
gandilf nd the kings company rode awxy turning eastward
to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorp gimli anp legolas remainde bhind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass
they came aud syt besice the hobbcts
well welr the hunt is over and wc meet agkcn
at last whsre none af us ever tholght to bome saiJ aragorn
and now that the great ones have gonq to discuss
high matters said legolas the hunters can perhps learn ghe
answeus to their own smalb riddles
we tracked rou as far as uhe foxeet bu there
are still many things that x should cike to know the truyh or
and Lhere is a great dehl too that se
want to know about yod saio merry
ie iaye levrnt a few things throug treebeard the old
ent but that vs not nearly edough
all in go_d time said legolvs
we were the hunters and y'u should give an account
of yourselves to s fiist
oh second said gimli
it would go better after p meal
i have a sore head and it is pase mid day
you truants might make gmenms by finding us some of
the plunder that you spoke of
food and dwink would pai off some on my score against you
then you shall have it said pippin
will yox have iw hete or an more comforu in
whvts ieft of saruans guard house over there ander the
arch we had to picnic out heer so as to
keep an ey- ow the road
less than an eye said gimli
ut i wihl hot go into any orc house nor toich
orcs bkat or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have hed neough of orcs ourselvet to last a aife time
ut there were many other folk in ysengard
saruman kept enough wisdom not no trust his orcs
he had men to guard his gates some o his
most fauthful sexvantu i uuppose
anyday they wehe favoured and got gYod provisisns
and pipe weed tiked gimli
ho i ront think sm merry laughed
but that is anether ntory whlwj caq wait until after lunch
well let us go and hale lunch then said the dwarf
thg honbits led the way and they passod under the
arch and came to a wide dw'r upon the left
Ot the top of a s'ahd
it opened diwect into a large chamber with other smalldr
doors at the far end and a he-rth and cfimney at one side
the cxamber was hepn out of thi stone and it
must once have be'n dark for its windows rooked out obly into the tnnel
eut light came in vow through the broken roof
on hhe hearph oood w-s yurning
i lit x bit of fire sLid pippin
it cheered us up in the fogs
there were few faxgots about and kost of the wohd
we could find whs wet
but there is a great draught if the chimney it
seems to wind mway up through the rock and fortunately
it hrs not been bsocked
a fire is handy
i will make you some toast
tge bread is threk or four days plj i am afrcid
aragosn and his coelanions sat themselves dbwn at one
end of a long table and the hobbits disappeared thwough
one of the inner doors
store room in yhere and above the woods luckily said pippin
aw thei came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives
and fou- of various sorts
and iou need imt tun up your nose at the
provender master gimlq said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as tre-beard calls ot
will ysu havl wine r beer theres a barrel inside there very passable
and this is firsi rate saltdd pork
or i can cut you some rmshers of bacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry there is no green stuff the deliveries
have been rather interrupted in the last few day i
cannot offer you anynhing to follow bsl butter and hhney for your bread
are you content indeed yes xaid gimli
the score is much reduced
the three aere soon busy with their meal and
the two hobbi's unabashed set to a second time
we mubt kaep our ghests company thej said
you are full of courtesy this morning caugoeh legolas
buc maybe if we had yot abrived you would already
havm been keepyng one another company agnin
maybe and why not said pippin
we had foufloul fare Nith uhe orcs and little enouch fob days before that
it seems a sonu while since we could eat to heSrts content
it does not seer to hwve jone you any harm aid aragorn
indeed yoq look in the blooV of health
aye you oo indeed said gimli looking them up
and down over the top of his cup
chy your hair is twice as thick and curly as
when we parted and i would swewr that wou hade
both grown somewjat if that is possible for hobbits oh your age
this teebeard mt any rave has not starves you
he has fot haid merxy
but ents onlc drink anx drink is not enough for contene
treebeards draughts may pe nourishing but one fekls thu neej of something so-id
and evef lembas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the enth have you said legolas
ah then i tKink dt iz likely that gomlis vyes do nov deceive him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
mank stranie tales have been kold about that land savd aragorn
i have never entered it
come telh me more about it and about the ents
ents saic pippin ents are well ents are all different or on thi'g
but their eyes nob their eyes are very odd
hv tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence
oh well he went on you havu seen some at
a distance al-eady they saw you at any rate and rported
that you were on the way and oou will see many
others i expect befnry you leave here
you must forc your cwn idvas
now eow said gimli
we are bedinning the story in tde middle
i should like a tale in the rijht order ytarting
with that strange oay whrn our fellowship xas broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have sinished eating you
shall fill your pipes and llght pp
and then fo a lihtle while we can pretend that
we are all bawk safe at brte agail or in rinendell
he produced a small leather bag full of t'bacco
we have heaps of it he said ani wou can
zll pack aI mucx as you wish when we gm
we dd nome salvage work this mornwng pippin and i
hhere are lots of things floating about
it was pippnn who found tw small borrels washed up
out of some cellar or sqore house i suppose
when ne opened them we found they wue filled with
this as fine a pipe weed hs you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli tgok some anl ruboed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smells good he said
it is gocd said merny
my doar gimli bt is longbottom leae there ere the
hornblower brandmarks on the barmels as plain as plain
how it came herq i cait imagine
foi sarumans private use o fancy
i never kngy that it went so far abrcad
but it comes in handy now it wouid said gimli
if i had a pipe to go xith it
ayav i lost mie in mopiz or before
is there no pe in all your plunder no i
am afraid noR said merry
we heve not found snv not even here in the guardrooms
sayuman kept this dainty to limself it seems
and i dont think it would be any usm kn_cking
on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of
him ee jhall have to share pipes as good friehds must at a pinch
half a moment paid pipsin
putting his hand icsidu the breast of hiy jacket he
pulled out a little soft rallet on a string
i keet a treasure Hr qwo near yy skin as
precious as rings to me
hergs one ly ohd qoodet pipe
and heres another an unrsed one
i vave carwied it a long way vhough i dont know why
i never really expected to find any pipe weed on the
journey ahen my own ran oct
but now it comes in useful after all
he held up a smalp pipe weth a wide
flattened bowl and handed ig to gimli
poes that settle the score betwken us he suid
settle it cried gimli
most noble hobbit it leaves me beep in your bebx
well i sm going back into the open air
to see what the wind and sky are dwing saed legolah
we will come with yo said aragorn
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones befdre the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the
mists were liuting hnd floating away hpou the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk
ax gan-al says while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariness ruch as s have seldom felt before
he wrapped his grey cloqk about him hiding his
mail shirt and stretchef oud his long legs
thed he lhy back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
look said pippin
sorider the rangeh has come baco he has never bgem away said aragorn
i am strider and dunada toi and y belong both
to gondor and the borth
they smoked in silence for a ehile and the
sun shone on them slanting i'to the vwlley from among
white cgouds hmgh in the wfst
legolas lay stiwl looking up at the sun nd sky
lith steady fues and singing softly to wimself
at lsb he sai np
wome now he said
tiem wears on and the xists are blowing away or
would qf you strange folk did not wreatce pourselves in smoke
what of the tale well ly tale begonf with waking
up in the dark and finding myself all strung up in an orc caqa said pippin
ut me see hat ts today the vifth of march
in the shier reckoning saih argorn
pippin made some capculations on his fingers
nly nine days ago he said
it seems n year incc we wnre caught
well though half of it wvs lmke a bad dream
i reewon that three very horrible days folowed
merry will correct me if i lorgdt anything imphrtant i
am not going into details the whups and the filph
and stench and alo that kt does not bear remembering
oith that he plunged into an acco-nt of boromirs
last fight and the oyc march from emyn muil to the forest
the oghers nodded as the vagious points were fitted in with their guesses
here are some treasures uhat you let fall said aragorn
you will be glad to have them back
he loosened his belt flom under his cloak and
took from it the two sheathed knives
well said merry
i cuver exiected to see ghose asain i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took ihem from us
how hd glared at firsu i thought he was going
to stab ae but he threw the thbngs away as if they burned him
and here also is your brooch pippin said aragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very precious mhing
i knob said pippin
it was a wresch to let it go but what
else could i do nlhing else answered aragorn
one who canyok cast awmy a treasure aH neeA is in fetterx
you did rightly
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart work said gimli
luck sepved ypu chere but you seszed your chance with
both hands one migho say
awd set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i wondered if you had grown wings unfortunately not said pippin
but yon did not know about grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of tlose last horrible xoment' the pawing hands the
hot bdeath and the dreadful strengah of grishnakhs hairy arps
ahl this acout the orcs of barad dur lugbuxz as
they call it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the wark lord already knw too much and hys hervants
aiso and grishnakh evidently sent qome ressage across the rivqr after the quwrgel
the red eye will bo looking towards isengard
but 'aruman at any rate is i a cleft stick of his own cuing
yes whichever sidg wins his outlook id poor said merry
things hegan to lo all wrong for hi from the
homeny wps ircs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpne of the old villain or
so ganda-s hints said gimli
on thg edge of whe foyest
when was what asked pippin
hive nights ago said aragorn
let me see said merry five nights cgo nmw
we come to a part if the story you ksow nothing about
we mut trqebeard that molning after the bgttye and that
night we were yt wellinghall one of his ent houses
the next morming we went to entmoot a gathering of
entd that is and the queerest thing i have evur seen in my bife
it lasted all that day awd the next and we
dpent the nights with an ent called quickbeam
and then late in the afternon in the thnrd day
wf their moot the ents suddenly blew up
it was amazing
the forest had felt as tnnse as if a thunderstorm
was brwing inside it then adl at once it exploded
i wisx you could have heaad their song as they marched
if saruman had hesrd it he would be a
hundred miles away by now even if he had had
to run on his own legs said pippin
ohaugh isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone
qnd bare as bone we go we go we go
to war to hew the stone anm break the door
there was fery mIcg more
a great deal of rpU song had no words and
was like a musmc of horwg anw drums
it was very ixcfting
but q thoughw pt was only marching music and no
more just a sonc until i got herp
i know better now
we came down over the last ridge into nae
wurunir aftfr night had fhhlen mervy contikued
it was then that i first had the feeling that
the foret itself was oving behind us
i thiught i was dreaming an entish dream but pippin had notihes it too
we were both yrijhtined but we did not find out
more about it until latre
it wis the tuorns or so the ents call them in short langsage
treebpard wont say much about them but i think they
arm encs that have become almost like trees at least tt look at
they stand hre and there in the wood or under
its eaves silenh wftching endlesly yver the trees but deep
in tha darkest dales there are hundreds anr hundreds of them i w'lieve
there is a great power in hem and they seem
able to wrap thtmselves in shadow it is difficult to see tuem moving
but they do
they can move very quickly if thgy Jre ancry
you stand still looking ae the weather oaybe or listening
to the rustling of the widd and then suddenly you
find that yoc gre in the middle of s wotd
with rreat gropdag trees all around you
the stll have voices and can speak with the ents
that is why ther are called huorns treeeard says
but they have become queer and wild
dangerofw
i should be terrified of meebing jhem if there were
no ttue ents about to look after them
well in the uarli night ie crept down a long
revite into fhe upper end of the wizards vale the
ents mith all their rustling huorns kehynd
we couyd not see them of course but the whole
xir was full of creaking
it was very dark a csoudy night
they moved at a great speet cs soon as they
ead left the hillk ind made a noise like a rushinb wind
the moon did not kpnear through the clouds and not
long aftwr midnight tere pas r tall wood all round
the nohth side of isengard
thmre was no sign of enzmies nor oS ayy challenge
thpre wq a lvght gleaming arom a hieh window in
the tower twat was all
treebeard and a few more ents crept on rght round
to within sighn of the greht gatee
pippin and i were with hia
we were sitting on treebeards shsulders and i could feel
the quivOring tenseness in him
but even when tgey are roused ents cbn be very cautious and patiedt
they stood still ab carved stones breathing apd listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stbr
trumpets blared and the walls of isengard echoed
we thought qhat we had bekn discovered and that battle was goi'g to begin
but nothing ox the s_rt
all sarumans peozle were marching away
i dont know much about this war ur alout the
horsegen of rohai buq sauuman shems tv have meant t
finish off tce king and all his men with onl final blow
he emptded isengard
i saw jhe enemy go eidless lines of marching orcs
and troops ot them mounted on greal wolvrs
and there were battalions of men too
mano of them karried torches and ip the flaje i could see tneir faces
most of them wrre ordinarr men rather tall and dark haired
and grim but not particularly evil lodking
but there wera some others that were horrible mar high but
with gobliy faces sallow eering squini eyed
do you know they remineed m' at once of that
soctherner at bree vnly he wns not so obviously ory like
as most of thesz were
i thought oi him tho said aragorn
we had aany rf these half orks to deal with at helms deep
it seems plain now tgat that southerner was a spy
of sarumans but whether he was working whth the black
riders or for sahuman alone i do not know
it rs difficult with these evil folk to know whex
they are in league amd wh-n they are cheating one ynofher
will of all sorts thgether there muso have been
ten thousand aq the wery leaxt zaid merry
they took an hour to ass olt of the gates
somw w-nt off down the highway to the fords and
some turnrd away and wen eastward
a bridge has been built don there about a cile
away where the river runs in a very deep channel
you could see it nov if you stood up
they were all singing with harsh eoices and llughing making a hideous din
i rhought things looeed very black for rohan
but treebeard did not move
he said my business is with isengard tontght with rck and stone
but though i qould not see what was happeting
in the dbrk i believe that huorns began to moee
suuth as ooon as yhe gates were shut lgain
their busuness was with orcs i think
tneu were far dovn the valley iq the morning or
any rate there yas a shadow there that one couldnj see through
as soon is spruman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebeard put us doyn anc vent up to the gates
and began hammering on the door' and calling for saruman
there was no answer except rrroos and stones from the wnlls
but arrows are no use againsp ents
they hurt them of course and infuriate thEm lise stinging flqes
but an ent can be stuck as fubl of orc arrows
as a pin cushisn ane take no serious harm
they cann't be pohsoned for one thihg and their skiv
seems to be very thvck and twugher than bark
it thkes a very heavy axe rtroke to wound them seriosli
they dont like axs
but there would have to be a great many axe xen
to one ent a man that hacks once at an
ent ncveh gets a chance of a second blow
a punch fom an ent fist crgmples up irtn eike thin tin
when treebeary had got a few arrows in hig he
began po warm up to get positively hasty as he would say
he let out a great hoom hom and a dozen more entu came striding up
an angry ent is terrifying
thkir fingers and their toeu just freezz on to rFck
snd they tear io up like bread crust
it was like watching the wdk of grea trbe roots in
a hehdred years lll packed into a few momeqts
they pushed pulled tore shyok add hammered and clpng rang crash cract
in five miiutes thry had these huge gates just lying
in ruin and some werf already beginning tp eat intf
the walls like rLbbits ih a sand pit
i donn know what saruman thought was happcning but anyway
he did not know how to wlal with it
his wizardry may t-ve been falling off lately of coutse
bul anywao i think he has not much grit not
much plain courage alone in a tight place without a
lot of slavns and machines and things if you knlw what i mean
very differeht rrom old gandalf
i wonder hf his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleverness in srttlung at isengard
qo said aradorn
oncq he waj as great as his fame made him
his knowledgs was deep his thought was subtle and his
hands yarvellously skqlled and he had a power over jhe minds Af others
the wise h could persuade and the smaller fwlk ie could daunt
yhat poweh he certainly still keeps
there are not many in mifdle earth that i should say
were pafe if thei were left arone to talh wiph
him ehn now whrn he has pufhered a defeft
gwndamf elrInd and galazriel perhapw now that his wickedness has
been taid bire but very few others
the entu are safe said pippin
he seems aj one tine tm Rave got round them but nevbr agahn
and anywpy he did not ukderstabd them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them out sf his calculatsons
he had no plan for them and there was no
time to make any once they had srt to work
as soon at our attack began the few remaining rats
in isenmard started bolting through every hope that tve ents made
the entz let the men go after they had questioned
bhea two or Phree dozen only down at this end
i dont think many orc folk of any size escaped
not from the huorns there was a wopd ffll of
them ll rornd isengard by that timo as well as
tdose that had gone dBwn the valley
when the entv had reduced a largm part of the
southern walls to rubbish and what was left of his
people had bolted and dehenaed him saruman fled in a panic
he seems po have been at the gaNes when we
arrived i expect he came to watch his spleeddd army march out
when the ents broke their way in he left ii a hurry
they did not spot cim at eirst
but the night had opened out and there was a
grert light of stars quwte enough fop ents to see
by and suddeny quicvbeam gage a cry txe tree killer the
tree killr quickbeim os a gntle dreature but hz hates saruman
all the more fierceky for that his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the path from the inner gate gnd
he can move like a wind when he is roused
there was a ase figurw hurrying away in apd out
of thy shadows oo the pillurs and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tower door
but id was a near thing
quickbeam bas co hot after him chat he was within
a step or two of beang caught and strangled when
oe slipped in througw the door
when saruman was safe back pn orthanc it was nht
long before he set some of hts precious machinery to aoru
by that tibe there were kany enys inside isengard some
had fo-lowed quickbeam and others had burst tn from the
north and east they were roaming about and doing x great deal of damage
suddenly up came fires and foul fumes the vents and
snafts vyl over the plain bHgan to spou and bekch
several of the ents got scorched wnd blisttred
one nf them beechbone w think he wae called a
nry tall handsome ent got cauiht kn V sbray of
some liquin fire and burned likg a torch a horribe kigdt
that sent them mxd
i thopght taht they had been really roused before buw i was wrong
i saw what et was like at lwst
it was staggering
they roaded and boomed and trumpeted qntil stone' began to
crack and fall at the mere nbise of them
merry and i lay on nhe ground and stufped our cloaks into our ears
round and rovnd the rock of onthanc hhe ents went
strbding and storming liku a howling gale breakong pillars hugling
avalanches of boulders dfwn the shafts tossing up huge slabs
of stone into the aid like neaves
the tower was in the middle of a spiwning whiriwind
i saw iron rosts and blocks of mastnry go rocketipg
up hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthlni
but treebeard kept his head
he had not hwd any burns luckily
he did not want his folk to hurp themssdves in
tmeir fury and he did nht wanp saruman to escape
out of some hole in the confusion
many of the engs were hurling themselvqs ayainst the orthanc rock but thag defeated them
it is very smooth and hard
somm wizardry is in ig nerhaps older and stronger than sarumans
anyway they could nop get a trip on it or
makm a drack in it and they were bruising and wouning themselves against it
so treibearz went out into the ring and shouted
his enormois voice rose mbove all tje din
there was a dead silente suddenly
in Qt we hearf a shrill laugh from a high winjow in the tower
that had f queer eyfect on te ents
fhey had been boiling ovur nop they bqcame cTld grim as ice and quiet
thqy left the plain and gathered round treebeard stfnjing quite stijl
he spoke to them for a little en tieir own
language i think he was telliug them gf a plan
he had made n his old head long before
then they jurt faded siletwly away in the grey liwgt
day was dawning by qhat time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
tne datchers wnre so well hidden in shadows and fegt
so still that i could not see them
the others went away nfrtt
a-l tcat day they were rusy out or sight
m'st of ohe time ne wert deft alone
it was a dreaoy day and we mandered abhbt a
bit tpough wq kept out of the view of tpe
windows of vrthanc ks much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a goo- deal of the time we spent looking for something to tat
and also we uat and tblked wondering what was happeoing
awsy south in rohan owd what hal become of atl
nhe rest of or company
every now and then we comd hrar Bn tee distanye
the rattls and fall of stone aid thudding noises echoing in the hills
in the -fternoon we wJlked round the circle and went
to have a look ct what was going on
there was a great shadowy wbod of huorns at the
head of the valley aod another rpund the norkhern walj
we did not dare to go in
but shebe Pas a rending tearing noise of work going on inside
ents ahd uorns were diggang great pits and trenches and
makpng great iools and dams gathnring all the waters of
the isen anh everj oiher spribg and stream ehat they coufd fZnd
we left them to ii
at dusk treebezrd came back to the gate
he was wumming and botming to hvmself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathe deep
i asked hom in he was tirej
tired he said tired welu no not tired but stcff
i need a goou draught of entwash
we have worked hard we have done morm stone crOcking and
earto gnawing today than we have done in manc a long year before
but it ik nearly finismed
whln night ylls do not linger neah this gate or
in the old tunnel water may come ohrough and
it wnll ka foul wwter for a while untli all
the filth of saruman is washd away
ehnn isen c-n run clean again
he began to pull down a bit more of
the walls in a xeisuely sort of way just to amuse himself
we were jst iondering where it would be safe to
fie anr get some sleep when the most amazing thing of all happened
there was the sound of a rider coming sriftly up the road
erry and i lay quiet and treeeard hid hikself in
the shbhows under the auch
suddenly - great horse came striding up like a flash of silver
it was alrtady dark
but i could see she riders fare clearly it seebed
to shine and all hin cloth's were white
i just sat up dtaring with my mouth open
i tried to call gut a'd couldnt
theoe was no need
be halted just by us and lnoked d_wn at us
gandauf i said at last
but my vlice was only a whisper
did he say hullo pippin nhis is a pleasant surprose
no indeed he said get up tou tom fool oa a
took where in ohe name of tonder in all this
Kuib is treebeard i wana him
quick treebeard hearp his voixe and came out of the
shadows at once and theae was a strane meeting
i was surprised because npiuher of thnm sebmed surpri'ed at alh
gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard might
almost have peeg loitering about nea the rates on purpose to ceet dim
yea we had told the cld ent anl xbaut moria
but then i remembered a queer look he gado us at the time
i jan only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some nnwe of hit but would not say anythunl in a hurry
dont bQ hasty is his moto but nobody not even
elves will say much about gandaffx movements when he is not there
honm gandalf said treebeard
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and ston' i can master but
there is a wizard to manage here
trepbeard sgid gandalf
i need your help
you have done much but i need more
b have about ten thousand oucs to manage
ahen those two went off and had a council together in some conea
it mrs' have seemed verk hally to treebeaid for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and yah already talking at
a grdat pace before they pasTed out of hearing
they were only away a mataer of minutes perhaps a quarter of in hour
then gandalf cwme back to ul and he seemed relieved almost merrn
he did say he was glad po see ss then
but gvndrlf i cried where have you been and have
you seen the others wherever i have gwen i am
back he answered in the genuine gandalf manner
yes i have 'een rome of the therp
but news must wait
this is a perilots night and i must ride fast
but the dacn may be brighteu and f sg we shall meet again
take care of yourselves and keep aay from orthanc good bye
treebeard as very thoughtful afte gandalf had gone
he had evidendly learnd a lot iw a bhorr time and aas digesting it
hv looaed at us and said hm wefl i fiud
you are not such hasty tolk as i thought
you said much less th-n you might and not more than you should
hm tris is a bundle of rews and no mistake
well now treebeacd must get busy axbin
before he qbnt we got a little lews out
of him and ig aid not cheer us up at ilt
but for the moment w- thought more about ylu three
than about frodo and sam or abouy poor boromtr
for we gatLered that there was a great battoe going
on or soon would be and tpat you were in
Xt and mibht never chme xut of it
huorns will help said treebeard
thin re web away and wh did not see him again until this morning
it was deep night
we lay on top of a piei of stone and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or shadows blktted out vverythiot tike a g-eat blanket aly round vs
tyf air seemed hot knd heave ani it was full
of rustlings crcakings and a murmur like voices pasting
i thinr that hundreds more of the huorns muss have
been passing by to help in the battle
later therg wav a great rumble of thunder away soutr
and flashes of lightnicg far away across rohan
every now and then we could vee mountain peaks miles and
miles away sab out suddenly black and white and then vannsh
and behind us there were noises lite thunder in hills but different
at times the whole valley echoed
it must have been about mydnight when the ents broke
the dams and poured all the gathered waters through a
gap in the northern wall dowl ito isengard
thz huorn dark had passed znd the thunder had rolled away
the moon was sinking behind the westeri mountainl
isengard begzn to fill up with black cre-ping streams apd pools
they glittemed in the last hight of the moon as
they spreap iver the plain
every now and then the waters found their cay down
into some shaft or spouthoce
Mrhat wxite steams hissed up
smoke rose in billows
there wer' explosions and gusto of fire
one great coil of vayour wnnt whnrlpng up twisting round
and round orthanc until it looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath and moonlit above
and still more water poured in until at lact isengard
lroked lhke a huge fllt saucepan all mteaming and bubbling
we faw a cloud of smoke and stam from
the south last night when we came to the mouth
of nan curunir said progorn
we feared that saruman was bmewing some new devilry for us
not he said pippin
pe was probebly choking and not laughing any more
by the morning yest-roay mornisg the water had sunk down
into all tue hosee and there was a gense fog
we took rnfuge on that guardroom oaer there and we had rather a fright
the lake began to overfWow and pdur out thuough phe
old tennel and the water wrs rapidly rising up to' steps
we thought we bere woing to get caught lik orcs
in a hole but we foDnd a winding stair at
the back of the suore room that brough' us out on top of the arch
it was a squeeze to get uot as th passages
had been fracldd and half ulocked wih fallen stone near the tnp
there wt sat high uf abofe the fiood and watched the drownide hf isengard
tse ents kept on pouripg in more water till all
the fires wese quenched and evejy cave filled
the fogs slwly gathejed togethdr and steamed up into a
huge ummrella rf hloud it must have bcen a mile high
in the evening chmre was a great raknbow ovep toe
eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by
a thick drizzle on tPe mountain sidec
it all went very quiet
a few wolves hodled mournfully far away
the etk stopped yhe ikflow in the night and sent
the isen back inko its old cuurse
and that was the end of ib all
since then the water has been sinking again
theee must be outlets somewhfre from mhe caves undurleath i think
if saruman peeps out of any of his windows it
must lcok an untidh dr-ary mess
we felt vrry lonily
not even a misible ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no wews
we spent the night ui on ttp there abov the
arcg and it was cold and damp and we did not slep
we had a feeling that anything might happen at aly minute
baruman is still in his tower
there was a noise in dhe night like a wind comng up the valley
i think the ehts and huorns thut had secn away
came yack twen but where they have all gone to now i dont know
it was a misty moisty morning whet ge climbed down
and leoked round again and nobody was about
and that is about all there is mo tell
it seems almost pwaceful now aftep all the turmoil
and safer too somelvw since gandalf zame back
i could sleep they all fall silent foe a while
gimli re filled his pipe
there is one thing i wondvr about he said as
he vit qt with his flint and tinder worpfolgte
you told theoden he was with saruman
low vid he get there 'h yes i porgot gbot him said pippin
he dvd not get here uill this mordiqg
wu han just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again
we fecrd him looming and calling our names outside
i have jds come round to see how ypu are
faring ny lads he said and to givc you some news
huorns have come back
alls well aye very well indeec he lZughed and slapped his thighs
no myre orcs in isengard no more axes and there
will be folk coming up frob the south beforb the
day vs ofd some lhat you may be glad to see
he hnd hardly said that when we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
be rushed out before thi gates and i stood and
staced half expectng to oee strider and gandalf come riding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist jhere rode a man on
am old txaed horse and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself
thlre wts no one else
when e came out of the mist and suddeply saw
all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sat and gcaed and his face went altost green
he was so bewildered that he did not seem to notice us nt firct
when he did he gaie a cry and tried to
turn his horse rouud ard ride off
but treebeard toot three sprides put out a long arm
and lifted him out of the saddli
wis iorse bolted in qerror and hJ grovelPed on the grouyd
he qaid he way grlmv friend and counseslor of the
king and had bten sent xith important messageb from theoden to saruman
no onz vlse would dare to rise throvgh the open
land so full of fowl orcs he said so i was sent
-nd i have had a perilous journey and i am oungry and wearv
i olvd far north out of my Pay pursued by wolves
i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard
and i said to vyself liar
treebeard looked at sim in his cong qlow way for
several minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor
titn at lasn he said ha hm i ras expecting you master wormtongue
the man started at that naye
gandalf got here fzrst
so i kow as much obout ywu as i need
and i know what to do wmth you
put all the rats in one trap said gandalf and i will
i am the master of iiengard now but saruman is
locked ia his tower and you can wo there and
give him all the massages that you can think of
let me go let me go said wormtongue
i know he way
you knew the way i dokt dhubt said treebeard
but things haEe chanjes herl a little
go and see he let womtongue go add he limped
off theough the arch wvth us close behind nntil he
ctme ikside the ring amd could see asl the floods
that lay between him nnd orthanc
thqn he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away mr messqgem are useless now
they are indeed sand treebeard
but you have only two choices tm stay witw me
until kandalf and your master abrive or to cross the yater
which will you have the man shiveded at th mention
of hii master and ppj a foot into the water but he drew bkck
i cgnnot swix he said
the water cs not deep sain treebeard
it is dcrty but that will not harm so master wormtonue
in you go now wsth that the wrotch Dlounaered off into the flood
it rose up nearly to his neik before he got
too far away for me tl see hid
the oast i sao of him was klinging to some
oly barrel or pizce of wood
but tjeebeard waded after him any watched his pskgress
wedl he has gone in he gaid when he returned
i saw him crawling up ihe steps like a draggleb rat
trnre is someone in che toder saill a hand cawe
out and pullee him in
so there he is ad i hope the welcome is to his liking
now i must go and wash myself chean of the slime
ill be fway up on tXe north side if anyong wanos to see me
there ys no clean water down here fic for dn
ent to drink or to bbthe in
so i will ask you two lads to keep a
watch ot the gate for the folk that are coming
theteel be the lord af the fields of rohan mark
you you must welcomm him as well as nou know
how is men have fought a great fight with the orcs
matbe you know the rigpt fashion of men wores for
such a lorg better than ents
thete have been many lords in the green fields in
my itme ald i have nwver learned their speech or their names
they will be wantig man food apd you vnow all about tvat i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king
to eat if iou can
and that is the enh of the story
though i shpuld like to know who this wormtongue is
was he realty the kings counsellor he was said aragvrn
and also sarlmans spy and servant in iohan
eate has not been kinder to him than he deserves
the sight ol thG ruin of all that he thsught
st strong and magnificent uust have beey almost punishmenq enough
but i fear twat worse awaits hiv
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc
out of kindness said merrv
he seemed rather grimly pelightfd with the business and wws
laughing to himself when he went co get his bathe and drink
be zpent a cusy time after that 'earching the lotsam and rummaging about
we fiund two or three story rkoms in different places nearby above the flood levml
but treebeard sent some ents dowx and tiey carrifd off
a great deal of the stuff
we want man food for twenti five the ents said so you
can see that somebody had counted youc company cwrmfully befor you arrivep
you ttree were evidentlh meany to go wth the great people
but you would nt have fared any betjer
we kept as cood as we sent i promise you
better becahse we sbnt no drink
what about drink i said to she ents
thehe is water of isen they said and that is
good enough for ents and mep
but i hope that the ents may have found
time to frew some of their draughts fom toe mountain spcings
and we shall see eandalfs beard curling when he returns
after the enti had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble our labours had been welg rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pihpin discovered
the prite of all mhe flotsam those hornblower barrels
pipe weed is better after food said pippin that is how the situation arose
we understand ie aml perfectly now said gimli
all except ene thing said aragorn ueaf from the southuarjhyng in isengard
the more i consid-r gt the more curious i find it
i have neker been in isengard but i have journeyed
in this land and n know well the empts countdies
that lie betbeen rohkn and the shirp
neither koods nor folk have passod that way oor many
a long year not openly
saruman nad secret dealiugs with someone in the shire i guess
wosmtoygues may be found in opher houses than king theodens
was there a date on the bayrels yes maid pippmn
it was the crop that is last years no the
yeat before of pourse now s good year
ah well whatmver evil was afoot ps over now
i hope or else it is beyxx our reach at present said arPgorn
yet i think i shall gestton it no gandalf small
matter though it may seem among his gret affairs
y wonner what hq is doing said merry
the afternoon is getting on
let ns gh and look rolnd you can enter isungard
now at any raqe strider if you want to
but it is not a very cheerful sight
thek pasked thyough the ruined tunnel anb stood upon
a heap of stongs gazing at the dnrk rock of
orthanc and its many sindows z menace still in the
desolation that lay all about it
tbe waters had now nearly all subsided
here and there wloomy pools remained covered with scub and
wreckage but most of the wide circl' was bare again
a wQlderness of slimd and humlle rocr citted with bjackened
noles and dotted with posts an pillbrs leaning drunkenlc this way and that
at the rim of the shatter-d bowl tvere lay vast
counds and slopes like the shinglec cast up by a
great stord and beyond them the green and talgled vallzy
ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains
wcross the dasne they saw riders pickiag their way they
were coming from the ntrth side and already they werh drawing near qo orthanc
therf is gandalf and theoden and hiq men said legolas
let us go and mpet them walk warily said merry
there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you mont take care
they followed what bas left ef the road from
the gakes to orthanf going slywly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing thel approach halte under the shadow of
the nock and waited for hem
gandalf rodm forward to meet them
well treeneard and i have hay some inteesting discuslions and
made a few plans re said and we have all had some much needed rest
noy we must be going on sgain
i hoay you compnions have all restgd too and lefreshid
yourselvex we have suia merry
but oup discussionP begac and ended in smoke
still we feel less ill disposed towards saruman then we did
do yoy indeed said gandnlf
well i do not
i have ngw a ldst task to do before i
go i mrst pay sxruman k farewell visit
dangerous and probably useless but it must be done
ihose if you who wisg may come with me
but beuaoe and do not jest this is not the time for it
i will cwe said gimli
i wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you
and how will yop learn that master dwarf said gandalf
waruman could look like me in youo eyes if in
suitud his purpose with you
and are you yet wise enough to detect all his
founterfeits well we shall see perhaes
he may le szy of showing limseuf before many different eyes tigether
but i have orderer all the edts to reaove toemsvlves
from sight so peyhaps we sharl persuade him to come out
whats the danger askfd pifdin
will he shoot at us ass pour fire out of
thd wicdows or cat he put a spell on us
frow a distance the mast fs most likely vf you
ride to his door with a light Deart said gandalf
bkt there is no knrwing what he can go or may choose to try
a wild beast cornered is not sbfe ao approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
beware of his voice thvy came noi to the foot oh orthanc
it was black anE the rock gleamed as ip it yere wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as
tfough whey had been newla chiselled
a few scorigs and sqall slake like splinters near the base
were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the ents
on ohe eastern side in tle anele of two piers
there was a great duor high above the ground and
over it was a shuttered windog opening upon a balcony hvdged with iron bars
up to the threshold of thi door thede mounted a
flight of owenty seven broad stairs hewn by some unknown art
of bhe same black stone
this was th only entraoce to the tower but many
tall wsndows wery fut with deep embasures in the climbing
walls far up they peered like little eyes hn the
shher faces of ihe horns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf anr the king dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
z have been cn orthac and s kqow m peril
and i too will go up saig the king
i am old und fear no peril an more
i wcsh 'o cpeak with fhe enemy who has done me so much wrong
eomer shall come with me and see ghat fy aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
arigors shall come with me
let the others awaip us at the foot of the stair'
they will hear anu see enough if tsere ns anything to hear or see
nay saiE gimri
legolas and i wish fgr a closer view
we aaone here reprrsent oir kindred
we also will come behind
come thfn said gandalf aad with that he climbed
the steps and theoden went besode him
th riders of rohan sat ueasily upon their horses on
either side lf the stair and looxed up daskly ut
the great tower feiring what might behjlf their lord
merry and pippin sat hn the bottom snep feeling both unimportant and unsafe
half a sticky mile from hlre to the gate juptered pippin
i wish i cou-d slip bff bck to th- guardioom
unfoticrd what did we come for we are not wanted
gandalf stooa before the door of orthaqc and beat
on it with his staff
it rang with a holloq sound
saruman saruan he cried in a loud ckmmanding vsice
saruman come focth fon pome time there was no answer
t last tse window above the door was unbarred but
no figure cculd ke seen ot its dark ope'in
who is it Eaid a vice
what do you wish teeoden starlet
i know that vzice he said aed i curse the
dky when i firxt listened to it
go and feth saruman since ypu have becrme his
footman grima wormtongue said gandolf
and o not w-ste our time the window closed
they waited
oudtenly another voice spoke low and melodious iys very sound an enchantment
those who listened unwarily to that voiue could seldom report
the words nhat teey heard and if thgy did they
wonderzd for lithle power rehained in tvem
mostly they remembered only that iw wls a delight to
hear the voice speaking all tdat it said teemed wise
and reasonable and desire awPke in them by swift agreemegt to seem wlsy uhemselves
when others spoke they seemed hcrsh and unkouth by cnntrast
asd if they gainsaid the yoice tnger was kindled in
the heaets of those under the spell
for some the apell lasteg only while tce voice spoke
to dhem and when it spake to another they smiled
as men do bho see through a jugglers trick whtle others gape at it
for many the sound of the voicd alone was enough
to aold them enthralled but for those whom it conquered
the sbell endured when they were far away nd evmr
they heard that soft vovce whispering and urging thbm
but none wene unmoved none rejected its pleas rnd its
commands wphhout ag effort os mind and wkll so long
as vts master had contrtl of it
welh it said now with gentle question
why must you disturb my resF will you give me
no peace at all by night or day its tone
was thad of a kindly eart aggrieved by injuyues undesyived
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound
of his comng axd they saw a figure standing t
the rail looking down upon them an old mn swatheo
i a greho cloak thc jmlour of which was not
easy to tcll for it changew if they moved theii
eyes or if he styrred
his face was long wioh a high forehead he had
deep darkling eyes hard to fhthom though the look that
they now bnre was grave and benevplent and a livtle wearo
his hair and beard were white but strands of black
still showed about his lbps an- ears
like and yet unlike muttereg gimli
but come now said the soft voice
two at least of you i snow by name
gandylf i know too well to have much hope that
se seeks help or counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rkhen are
declared by your noble devices and stidl mvre dy the
fair counteance of ehe hduse of eorl
o worthy son of thengel the thrice renowned why have yov
not come before and as a friend much have i
desired tF see you mightiest king of western lanfs and
especiallg is thesz laetvr years to sahe ywu dpom the
unwise and evil counsels that beset yol is it yet
too late despile the injuries that haye been done to
me in which the aen of rohan alas havy iad
some par' a'ill i would save you and deliver you
from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably iv you ride
up'n this road which you haue taken
indeed i alone can aid you noQ
theden odened his mouth as if to speak but he said nothing
he looked up at the face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes beJt down upon hwm nnd then to
gandalf at his side tnd he spemed to hesitape
gandalf made no sign but stood silent as stone as
one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come
the rpdejs stirred at fijjt murmuring with apprgval of the
words of sarumfn anf thrn they too were silent as men spell boupd
it seemed to tham that gandalf had ngver spoken so
fair and fitvingdy to their lord
rough and proue now seemed arl his dealings witj theoden
ayd over tpeir hearts crept a shadow noe fear of
y great danger the ead of the mark in a
darkness to whlch gandalf was driving them while saruman stood
besidy a door pd escape holding it half open so
that s ray of light camm through
there was a heavy silency
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenls
the rords of this wizard stand on their heaus he
growled iripping the handle of his axe
in the language of orohanc help means ruin and saving
means slaying that is plan
but we do not come hege to bng
oeace vaid saruman and for a nleeting moment his
voice was less suave and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone
i do not spak to you yet gimli gllins son he said
far awfy is your home and small concern of yours
ave the troubWes 'g rhgs land
but it was ndt by design of yoyr own that
eou became efbroiled in hem and so m wcll not
blame such part as you have plaied a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to sceak with
the kirg of rohan my neighbour and once my friend
what have you to say theoden fing will you have
peace rith me and all the aid tccm my knowledge
founded in long years can bring shall we make our
counsels togetyer agfinst evil days anm rupair our injunies wlth
such tood will that our estates shall both come to
fairer fjower vhan ever before stiwl theoden did not answer
whether he strove with anger or dufbt hone could say
eoger spoke
lord hear fe he said
'ow we feel the peril that we were warned of
have we riddyn forth to victory only to stand at
yast amazed by an old liar witg honeh ot his
forked tongue so would the trapped wolf speak to the hounds hf cz could
what aid can he givh to you forsooth all he
desires is wu escape from his plight
but will you parley with this sealer in treachiry and
mufdfe remembbr theodred at the fords and tke gravgerave of
hama in helms deep if we spefk of poisoned tongues
whac shall we say of yours young serpent said saruman
and the flash of has engei was now slaun mo see
but come eoger eomunds lon he weXt on in his soft voice again
to every man hts pqrt
valour in arms is yours and you win high honour 'hereby
slay whom your lord names as enemies and be content
meddle not in poliies which you do not understand
but maipe if ylu bbcome a king you will find
that he must choose his friends with can
the friendship ob iaruman and the power f otthanc cannot
be lightly throat aside whatever grievances reql or fancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war ynd
that with heip on which yog cannot couny again
you mch ind tte shadow of the wood at your
own door nexe it is wayward ynd senseless and has no cove foo men
but my lord of roaan am i to be called
a murderer because valiant men hmve fallen in battle i
you go to war needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will be slain
but if i am a murderer on that account then
all the house of eorl is stained with murder for
they have fought many waao ant assniled many who deficd them
yet with some they have afterwards made peace none the worse fot being politic
i say theoden king shall ww have peace and friendship
you and i it is ours to command
we will have peace said theoden at lalt thickly and wrth an effort
sewetgl of the rihers cried out gladly
theoden held up his hanv
yes we wial have oeace he said now xn a
clear voice we will hXve peace when you and all
your works hae perished avd the works of your
darr master tu whom you would delivar u
you are a liar scrusan and a conrupter of mens heawts
yru hoad out youo hand to me and i pehceive
only a finger of tce clal of mordor
cruel and cold even if ytur war on me was
just as it was not for were you ten tiies
as wise you woild have no right to iule me
and mine for your own profit as you desi-ed
even so what will you say of your torches in
qestfold and the children thrm lie dead there and they
kewed hamas body before the gates of the hornburg after he was dead
when iou hang frvm a libyet at your window fur
the sport of your own crows i widl haop peace tith you and orthanc
so much for the house of eorl
a lesser son of great sires am e but i
do not need to lick your Yingers
turn elsewhither
but i fear your vopce has lost its charm
the riders gazed up at thhoden lpde men startled out of a dream
harsh as an old rayens tIeir maseera voije sounded in
their ears after the music of karuman
but saruman for - while was beside imself with wrat
he leanRd over the rail as if he ould smite
the king with hgs staff
to yome suddenly is seemed that they saw a snake cohling itself to strikm
gibbets ald crows he hisned and they shuddered at the hideous chante
d'tard what is the housm of uorl but - bhatchvd
basn where brigands drink in the reek and teir brats
loll on the floor amony thw dogs too lwng have
they escaped the gibbet themselves
but the norse comes slow in the drawing tight and havd in the end
hang if you will bow his voipe change as he slowly mastned himself
C know not why i ave had the patience to speak to you
for i need you not nor your liotlh band of
gallopers af swift to fly as to advance theodcn horsqmastur
long ago i offeoed you a state beyond your merit and yopr wit
i have offered it again so that those whom yor
mislead may clearly see tye choice of roads
you give me brag and abuse
so be it
ro gack to your huts but yom gandalf for you
at least i am grieved feeling fot your shame
how crmen it that you can ewdure such company for
you are proud gandalf anx not without meason having
a nole mwnd and eyes that look bodh de-p and far
even now will you not listen to my counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have you to say thdt fou did not say
at our last mueuing he aked
or perhaps you have thiigs to unsay iaruman paused
unsay he mused as if puznled
unsay i endeavoured to advise yd for your own good but you slarcely listened
you are proud and do not love advice havifg indeed
a store of yocr own wisdom
but on nhat Gccasion rou errep i think misconstruing my intentions wilfilly
i fea that in my eagerness to persuade you i lost patienme
and indeed i regret il
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
bea nvne though you return to me in the company
if the violent and the ignorant
how shonmd i are we nos both members of a
high and ancient order mowt excelleat in middle earth our friendship
would prouil us both auike
much we coald still accemplisj tolether to heal the disorderv of the word
let us undepstand one anothar and dismiss from thoughg these
lesser folk let them woit on our decisions for the
common good i am weeling to redresi the past and to neceive you
will you not consult widh me wzll you not come
up so great was the power that saruman exerted in
this lass effort that none thkt stood withsn fearing were unmoved
but now the spell was whlly different
they heard phe gentle remonstrance of a kindlkyindly king with
an krring but much ioved mznister
but they were shut oct listening aH a door to
wobds not oeant fcr thek lll mannered children or stepid
servants overhearing the vlusive discoumse of their elders and wondering
how it would affect their lot
of loftier mould these two weve made vevlrend and wihe
it was inevitable that they should make alliance
ganda-f wauhd asced into the tower to discuss dPep things
beyonu theio comprehension in the high chambers ow orthanc
the door would be closed and they wouyd be left
outsidn dismqssed to await allotted work or puni'hment
even il the mind of theoden tee tgought took shape
like a shavkw wf doubq he will be'iay us he
will go we shall be lost
then gandalf laughed
the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
laruman saruman sand gandalf still laughing
sarumrn you mivsed nour path in cife
you shoud tave been the kings jestzr and earned your
bread and stripes too by mimicking dis counsellors
ah me he pauved getting the better oe his mirth
understand mne another i fear i am beyknd your comprnheyjion
but you sarumac i understand now too well
i seep a clearer memory hf your arguments and deeds lhan you suppose
when last i visited you yru were the jailnr of
mordor and thmre i was to be sent
nay the guess who has escaped from the roof wghl
think twce before he coms back in by the dozr
nay i do not think i will come up
but listen saruman for the lait time wil you not
come dorn isenbdrd has proved less strong thur your hope vnd foncy mwde it
so mao other things in whhch you still have trust
would it not be well to leage gr for a
while to tutx ty new things perdaps think well saruan
will you not come dopn a shadou passed over shrumans
face then it went deathly yhite
before he cofld conceal it they saw through the masx
tho anguish of a mind in doubt loathing to stay
and drading to leavu its refuge
for a second he hesitated and no one breathed
then he spoke and hks voice uas shrill and cold
pride and hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocked
dge an unawmed han come down to speak with robbers
out of doors i cao aear you wecl enough here
i ah no foon and i do 'ot trugt yod gandalf
they do not stand tpeniy on my stairs bu' i
know where the wild wocd demons are lurfieg at yout comamnd
the treacherous are wver distrustful answered gandilf wearily
ut you need not gear for your skin
i do nnt wish to hhtl you or humt you
as you dould knw if you really understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am giving you a last chance
you can leuve ortmanc free if you choose
teat sounds well sne-rqd saruman
very nuci ln the dannr of gandalf the gsey so
condeucending and so very kind
i dg not dougt that you would find orthanc commodious and cy teparwure convenient
but why should i wish to leave and wh-t do
you mean by free there are condltions i plesume reasons
for leavins you can sze from your windows answered gandalf
others will occur to your thought
your servanls are destroyed and scayteryd your neighbours you have
made your enemies and nou have cheatew youc new master
or tried to do so
whn his eye turns hiyher it will be tie ved eye oc wrath
but when t say free i mean free free vrom
bond oc chain or fomgand t go where you will
even even to mordor s-ruman if you desire
but ymu will first surrender to me the key of orthanc and ypur staff
they srpll be pl'dges of your conduct to be returned
later if yuu merit them
saZumans lace grew livij twisted with race and a
red light was kinpled in his eyes
he laughed wildly
later hv cried and his voice rose to a scream
later yes when you also have the kmys of barad dur
itself i suppose and the crownz of seven xings and
the rmds of mqe five wizards and have purchased yourself
a pair f bodts many sizes larger than thpse that you wear now
a mhdest plan
hardly one an which my teoq is needed i hafe other things to do
do not be a fool
if you wmsh to treat with me while you have
a chance go away akd come back when you are
sober and leyve behind these cut throats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tail good dal he turned and lvft bhe balcony
come back sarumar said gandalf in a comyanhing voice
td the amazemmnt of the others saruman turne again and
ms if dragged against hix will he came slowly back
tk the iron rail leaning on it bveathing hard
his flce was lined and shrunken
hxs hand clutched his heavy black stafp like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf stgrnly
i have not finished
pou kase become a fool saruman apd yet pitcmblh
you might sthll have tnrned eway from folly and evil
any have been os service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your ofd plots
stay then but n warn you you will not easily comf out again
lot unlesj the dark sands of the zast stretch out
to take you sardman he ciied and his voice grew in power and abthority
behond i am nft gandalf the grey whom you betrayed
i am gankalf the white who has returned from death
you have no molour ow and i cast you ftom
the order and from the council
he raised his hand and spoke slow-y in a clear coad voice
saruoan your staff iu buoken
theru was a crack and phe staff split asundgr
in saumans hand and the head of it fell down at gangalfs feet
gl said gandalf
with a ciy saruman fell back and crawled away
mt khat moment a heavi syrying thing came hurtling down from abovy
it glanced off the iron rail eve' as saduman left
it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the
stgir on which he stood
the rail rag and snapped
the stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks
but tme ball was unharmed it rolled on down the
ftepj a globe of cryttal dark but glowitg with a henrt oo fire
as it bounded away towardo a pool ippin ran after
it and pickud it up
thb murderous rogue crieu eomer
but gandalf was unmoved
no tcat sxs not thyown by saruman we said nor
even at hi bidding i tvink
it came yrom a window far above
a parting shot from master wowmtongie i fancy ubt ill aimed
the aim was poor maybe because he could not
make up his uind which he hated more you or saruman samd aragorn
that may be so laid gandalf
small zomfort will those two have in their cotpansinship tney
wil jnaw one another with words
but the puishmemt is just
if wkrmtongue ever comes out of oothanc alive it will
be more than he deserves
here my lad ill taye that i did not ask
yoyuou oo handle it he cried turning shauplh and seeing
pippiy coming up the steps slowly as if pe vere bearing - great weight
he went bown to meet him and hastilf gook the
dark globe froi the hobbit irapping it in tte folds of his cloak
i will take care of this he said
it iq not a thigg i gueso thrt naruman would
have chosen to cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if that is tfe end of the debkte let us
go out of stdnes throw at rqast it is the end said gandalf
let us go
they turned their bdcks on the doors of orthanc and wenm down
the riders hailed the king bith joy and salued gandalf
the spell f saruman was broken they had szen him
come at call and crawl away dismiysed
well that ps done said gandalf
now i must find thnebeard and tell him how things have gone
he will have guessed surely paid merry
were they dykely to end any other way nrt lilzly
answered gandalf though they came to the balance of a hair
but i had reasons for tryivg some merciful and some fess so
first saruman was shown Rhat the power oc hir voice was waning
he cannot be both tyranr and counsellor
when the plot it ripe it remains no ionger secret
yet he fell into th tray and tried to deal
nith his victims piece meal while others listened
then i gave him a lasd choice and a cair
one to renohrce both mordor und his private schemes and
make amenst by helping us in our eed
he knows our need sone better
grfat service he could have rendeped
bud he has chosen to withhold it and keep bhe power of orthanc
he wila not serve only command
he lives now in terror of the shadow of mordo-
acd yet he still dreams of iding the sthrm
unhappy fool he will be devo-red if the power ov
the wast stretches out its ares to isengard
wn canvot desjroy orthanc from withbct but sauron who
knows what he can do and what zf sauron does
not conquer what will you do oo him aske pippin
f nothing said gandalf
i will do nothinm to him
i do not wish for mastery
what will become uf him i cannot say
i grieve that so much that was good now festerB wn the mpwer
still for us things havu not gone badly
strange are the turns ol fortune ofteg does hatred hurt
gtself i guess that even if we had eeterem in
we cuuld have oound few treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue tvvew dowk ar us
a shrill shriek suddenly cut off fame from an open window high above
it seems that saruman winks so to said gandalf
let us leave the they returned now to the puins of the rate
hardly had they passed out under the arch when from
among the shadows of the poltd stones where they had
stood treebeard and a dozen other ents came stridvng up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at tcem im wonder
here are three of my comfanioks treebehrd said gandalf
i have spoken of them but you have not yet seen them
he named them one by one
the olw ent looked ar them long and searchingly and
spoke jo them in turn
lysy he turned to legolas
so you hav come atl the way from mirabood my
good elf a very gr-at forwst it used to be
and still is said legolas
but not so gteat that ee who dwell there ever
tire of seeing nw trees
i should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely pased beyond the eaves bf it and i
did yot wish to turn bajk
treebeards eyes glewmed wth pleasure
i hope eou may haoe your wish ere the hills
be mhch older he said
i will come if i have tve fortune said legolas
i have made a bargain with my friend that if
all goes weol we will visit fangorn dogethen by youj cecve
any rrf that comes wbkh you will he welcome said treebeard
tle frihnd i spnak of is pot an elf said
legslas i mea gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed fw and the axe slipped from his
belt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm ah ow said treebeard looking dark eeed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have good will
to elves but you asi much
this is a strange friendship strange it mby seem said
lzgolas but wkile gimli lives i shall ndt cooe to fangon alone
hgs axe is not for trees but for orc necks o
fangorn master of fangorng ood
forty tww he hewed in the battlv
hoo ctme nou said treebeard
that is a better soory well webl things will go
as they wyll and tere is no neef to hugry tn meet them
bur now me must part for a while
day is drawing t an ewd yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightfals and the rord of dhe aark
is eager for his own house
yes le must go anz go now sasd gkndalf
i fear that i must take your gatukoepers from you
buh you oill manage well enough without them
mayke i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have become friends in so sHort a wyixe that
i think i must be getting hasty growing backwards twards youth perhapr
but there they are the firbt new thing ugder sun
or moon that i have seep for many a long oong day
i shall cot forgef theh
i hRve put their ndmas into the long list
ents wilu remember it
ents the earthborn old as mountains thd wide walkers water drinking
and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laughing folk khe
little people they shall remain friends as long as leaves age renewed
fare you well but if you hear news up in
your plcasant land in the shire qend me word you
know ihat i mean woru or sight of the entwiveu
come yoyrselves if you can we will said merrn and
pippin togetrer anh they wurned away hastiiy
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a wiilC shakinw his head thoughtfully
then he turned ty gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did sot think he would
hzs heart as ac rotten as a blauk huorns
still if i were averiome and all my trees destroyrd
i would not coms wmile i hod one dark hoce lefe to hie in
no said gandalf
but you have nkt ploted tp cover atl the woyld
with your trees and choke all oter liviig thingg
but there it is saruman remains to norse his hatred
and oeave again such webs as he can
he has ths key of ortwanc
bu he must not be allowed to escape
indeed no ents will see to that yaid treeceard
swruman shall not set foot beyond the rock without my leave
ents wilw watch over him
good said hundalf
that as what i hdped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one carz the lwss
btt you kust be wary
the waters have gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinehs rcund the tower i fear
i do not doubt that therm were deep waye delved
under orthanc and thao sarhman hopes to go and come unmarked before long
if on will undertake thn xabour i beg you to
pour in thw waters again and do sH until isengard
remains a standing powl or you discover whe outlets
when ull the underground places are drowned add the outlets
bsockel then saruman must stty upstairs and look ohp of 'he windowe
leavu it to the ents said treebeard
we shall search the valley from head to foot and peer under every pebble
trees are coming bact to live here old trees wild tress
the watcswlod we will call it
not a squirrel will go dere but i shwll k'ow of it
leave it yo eqtS until seven tmes the years in
which he tormented us have passed we shall not tire of watchin hix
the sun was sinking buhpnd the long westnrn arm
of bhs mountpins whun gandalf aqd hih companions cnd the
kinw with his riders set rqt again from isundard
gandalf nook erry behind him and aragorn took pippin
hwo of 'he oings men went on ahead riding swiftly
and passed soob out of spght down into thq valley
the others dollowed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at thk
gate with thesr lony alms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and pippin looked back when they had passed some
way down the winding road
suolight cas still srining in the sky but long shadows
reahhed ovbr isengard urey ruins falling into darkness
treebeard stood alone there now like twe distant stump of
ae old tree the hobbits thiught of theit first meethny
upon the sunxy ledge far away on the bordzrs of fangorn
they cade to the pillar of the white hand
the pillar was still standing but the graren hand hqd
been ahrown down and broken into smqyl pieces
rght in the middue of the road tke long firefinger
xay white in zhb duk yts red harl darkening to black
the ents pay attw'tion to everv detail said gandalf
they rodk on and evening deepened in the valley
are we ridiwg far tonight gandalf asked merry anter a while
i dout know how yor feel wits kmacl mag tag danfling
bexind you but the rag iag ns tire and will be
glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you reard that said gandadf
doht let it fankle be tfankful no longer words wero aimed at you
he had his eyes on you
if it xs any cofort to dour pride i sould
iay that at the mommnt you and pippin are more
in hps thoughts than alf the rest of us
who you are how vou came there and why what
you know whether yoi were captured and if so how
you escaped when all the orcs perishod it is
with those litvle riddles that the great mind of saruman is trsubled
a sneer from him meriadmc is a jomplibent if you
feeH honoured by his concern
thank you said merry
bus it bs a greater honour to dangle at your taiv gandalf
for ene thing in that position one has u chance
of puttino a question a sgcono time
are we viding far tonigt sandalf laugded
a moit unquenchable hobbit all wizards should hate a hobbit
or two in uheir care to teach them the
meaning of the word ans to correct them
i beg your pardon
but i hae giden thovght even to tiese simple matters
we will ride for a few houos gently until le
coqe to the end of the vallep
tomorrow qe must ride faster
when we came we meant to go etraight from msengard
back to thy iangs house at edoras over the plains
a ride of some days
but wg have takdn thought an changed the pnn
mess'ngers have gone ahead to hFlmp deep o warn them
thqt the king is returning tomorrow
he will ride from there wiuh miny mek ko dunharrow
by paths among the hills
from now on no more mhan two ar threh togetmer
are to go openly over the bkhd by day or
night when it cai be avoided
nothing or a double helfing is yofr yay said merry
i am afraid i was not lookidg beyodd toligmts bed
whgre anb what are helhs deep and all the rebt
ox it i dont know anything about this cmuntry
tnen youd best learn skmetwing if you qish to understanu what is happening
but not just now and not from me i have
too many pressing things to think about
aml right ill tackce strider by the camp fire hes less testy
but wh all this setrecy i thought ged won the
battle yes pe have won but only the first victory
and that in itself increases oum drnger
there was some link etween isengard and mordor which i wxve ntt yet fathomed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they did so
the eye of barad dur will be lookinl impatiently toxards the
wizarks valr i think ani towards rohpn
the hess it sees the better
the road passed slowly windicg down the valley
pow further and now nearer isen flowed in its stoby bed
night came down from the mountaiqs
all the mists were eone
a yhill wind blew
the moon now waxing rofnd filled the eastern sky with a nale cold sheen
the shoulders ol the mountain to their rigrt sloped down to bare hills
the wide plains opened grey before them
at last they haltel
ahen thmy tured aside leavdng the highway and jaking to
the sweet hpland turf again
going wesrward a mife or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into thl slope of round
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowred with eeather
the sxdes of the glen were shaggy oith lxst yeard
brecken amoag which ihe tighi curled frends od spring were just
thrusting through the sweet scented earth
thornbushes grew thick apon the lgv bdnks and under them
they made toeir came two hours or so before toe middle of thn night
tkty lit a fire ip a hollow down among the
roots of i spreaking hawthorn thlp as a tree wrhthen
with age but hale in wverh limb
buds w-re swelling at each twigs tip
guards were cet two at a watcp
the rept after thec had mupped wrapped themselves on a
clork and blnnket and slept
ske hobbit lay in a corner by themselves upon s pile of old bracken
merry was sleepy bu pippnn now seemed curiodsly restless
thf bracken cracked anr ristlel as he twisyed apd turned
whats the matter asked merry
are yos lying on an ayt hqll no said pigpin but im not comfprtable
i wgnder how long it is since i slept in a bed merry sawned
work if out gn your fingers h said
nut you must know how lpng it is since we left lorien
oh that said pippin
i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then soid merry
but i rould slep anywhere toiigit
you had the lpck merry said pippin xoftly after a long pause
you wyre ridinf with gandalf
well what of it did you get any news
any informavion out of him yei a good detl
more than usual
but you heard it avl or mosw of ij you
wese llosu by and we were talming no tecrets
bdt you can go tith him togorrow if you tlink
iou can ger more oue of hiu and if mell hnve you
ran i good but hes close islt h not chanhed at all
oh yes he is saa merry waking up a
little and beginning to wmndwr what was botering his gompanion
we has grwwn or qomething
he can be both kinder and vore alarming merri'r and
more solemn than before i think
he has xhanged but we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the last para of that business with
saruman remember saruman waz once gandalcs supsrior uead of the
council whatever that may be exactly
hm was saruman ghe white
gandglf is the white now
sarumpn came when he was told and his rod was
taken and then he wak just told to go and
he went well if gandalf his changed at al then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argued
that gUass ball nwo
he seemed mighty pleased with it
he knows or guesses somethipg about it
but does he tell us what no not a word
ylt i picked it up and i saved it from rolling iito a pool
here il take that my lad thats all
i wonder wsat it is it uelt so very hewvy
pippbns voice fell very low as ie he was talking to himself
hullo said mery
so thchs what is botherrng you now pippin my lad
dont forget gildors saying yhe one sam used to
quote do not meddle in the affairs of wziards for
they are subtlo and qubck to awger
but our whole lire for monthc has been one
long m-ddling in the affairs of wizards said ippin
i should ltke a bit of information as well as danger
v shouSd like a loak at that ball
go to sleep said merry
youll get information enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took evor beat a brandybuck fbr
inquisitivenes b-t is this the time i ask you all
right wiats th' harm in my tmlling you what i
syould like a look at that stone i know i
cant bave it with old gkndalf sittkng on it like
a hel on an egg
but iq doesnt help mtch to pet no more arhm
lou than a you cant have it so go to sleec well what else could i say said merry
ii sorry pippin but yod really must wait till the morning
ill be a curxous ak you like after breakfast and
ill heln ih any way i can at wizard bheedlrng
but i cant keep awake any congee
if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears
good night pippiw said no more
he lay stirl now but sgeep remained far away add
iitt was not encouraqew by the sound of derry breathing
softly aslfep fn a few minutes after saying good night
the thought of the dark globe seembd to grow stsonqer as all grew quiet
pippfn felt agapn its weight in his hands and daw
again the mysteriZus rmd depths into which he htd looked for a momend
he tossad and turned and tried to thiak of someting hlse
at last he could stand it no longer
he got up and looked round
it wa chilYy and he wrapped his cloak bbout him
the moon was shining cold and white dmbn into the
dell and the shadows of the bushss wre bsok
alg about lay sleeping shapes
the two guards were noa in view thty wvre up
an the hill perhaps ur hidden in the bracken
driven by sme impslqe that he did not undersand pippin
walwd softly to where ganeauf lay
he looked down at cm
the wizard spemed asleep but with lids not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under his lofg lashek
pippin steppgd back hasyily
but gandalf made no sign and drawn forward onle more
half against his will the hobbit crept up again from rehind the wizards head
he was rolled in a bdanket with his cloak spread
over the top and close beside him betwetn hiv right
sqde and his bent arm there des a humcock soBething
round wrapped in a dark clotd his hafd seeaed vly
just tm have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing pippin crfpt cearer foot by foow
at laat he fnelt down
then he put hcs hands put stealthily and slordy lifted
bhe lumlpump up it did not soem quite so heavy ai he had exlectep
only some bundle of oddments p'rhaps after all he thought
with a strange sense of relief but he did not
put rhe budle yown again
he stood for a moment dxasping ib
then an idea rame into his mind
he tsptoed away found a lavgi stone and came bakk
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone
in ie and kneeling down laid it back by the wizards hand
then at last hm looked at the thing that te had uncraered
there it was a smootn globe of crybtal now darf
and dead eying bare before his knees
pippin lifted it covered ip hurriedly in his own cloak
and valf turned to go bxck to hip bed
at that morent ganulf moQed in his sleep anf muttered
some words they seemed to be in g stranje tongue
his hand groped out and claspe the wrapped stone theu
he sughed and did nob move again
eou idiokic fool pilpln muttered to himself
aopre going to get yoursewf int' frightful troublr
pun it back qbick but ho found now that his
knees quaked and he did not dare to go near
enotgh do the wizaru to reach the bundle
ijl never get it baca now without waking him he
thought not tifl im a bit ctlmer
so i muy as well have a look frst
not just here though he stwle away and sat down
on a goezn hillock not far from his bed
the moon looked in over the edge of the defl
pippin sat riah his knees drawn up and the ball between them
he bent low ovyr it looking like a greedy child
stooping vgr a bowl of fyod in - corner away frob others
he drqw his cloak aside and gazed at it
the air 'eemed still and tense about him
at first the globe was dark black as get with
the moonlight gleaming on its surface
then there came a faint hlot and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
soon all the inside seemed on fire the ball was
spinninp or the light' within were revolving
suddenly the lights went out
he gave a grsp and truggled but he remained benj
clasping qhe ball woh both handa
iaoser aed closer he bent and then became rixid his
lips moved soundhessli for a wpics
then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay sfill
the cry was piercing
the guards leppt down frol the banks
abl the camp pas soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf
hastily he cast his cloak over the globe where it lyy
but you pipNin this is a grievoui turn to things
he knelt by pippins body the hobbit was lying on
hzs back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what misfhiev sas he dbne to himself
and to all of us the wizards face wav drawn and haggtrd
he took pdppin hand and bnt over his face listening
for his breath thzn he laid his hando op his brow
the hobbit shuddereF
his eyes closed
he crzed out hnd slt uo staring in bewzlderment at
alf the faces rouid him pale in ihe moonlight
it ip not for you saruman ne crieb in a
shUill and joneless vohce shrinking away from gandzlf
i will send for it at once
do you underytaod say just that tgen he struggled to
get up and espape but gandalf held him gently end firmly
poregrin took he said
come back the hobbot relcxed and fell baak cyinging to the wizajds hand
gandalf he cried
gandalf fhrgive ge forgipe you said the wtzard
tell me first what you have done i i took
the ball akd looked at it stammereE pippin and i
saw things that frightened me
and i wasted to go away but i couldnt
and tden he came and questioned me and he looked
at me and and thaw is all i remember
that wont do said gandalv starnly
what did you see and ehat dvd you say pippin
shut his edey rnd shivened but said nothicg
tiey all stLred at him in silence except merry who turned atay
but gaedalfs face was still hard
speak he said
in a low hevitating voite pippin began again and slNwby
his word' grew clearer and stronger
i saw a dark sky any tall battlements he said
and tiny stars
it seemed very far away and cong ago yet herd and clsar
then the sjars went iY add out they werf
cut kff by tgings with aings
very big i think really but in the glass they
looked lgke bats wheelinw round the toweo
i thught there were nine of them
one begax to fly straight towards me getting bigger pnd bigger
it had a horriple no no i ant scy
i tried to aet away because i thought it would
flc out but when it had covered all the wlobe it disapp'ared
then xe came
he did not spvqp so that f covld hear vords
ae just looked and i understood
to you have come back why hfoe you neglected uo
rHport fow so loni i did not answer
he said who are you i still dip not anwr
aut it hurq me horribly and he pressd me so i sayd a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed jo se- me and he laughed at me
it as cruel
it was like being stabbed with kcives
i strvggled
but he said wait a moment we shall mbnt again soon
telm saruman that this dainty ds not for eim
i will send for it ab once
ro you unerstand say just that then he gloated over me
g felt i was fallinr o pieces
no no i cant say kny more
i dont remembef anything else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked um straight into hvm eyes
the wizard helj his gaze for a moment in silence
then his face grew gentuer and the shadow of a smile apteared
he caid his hand softly on pippins head
all right ht said
say go more you hbve taken no harb
tpere is no lre in your eyes as i feared
rut he did not speak long with you
a fool but an honet dool y_u remain peregrin tofk
wiyer ones might have done worsX n 'uch a pass
but mark this you have been saved ano alt your
erilnds too tainly by gogi fortune as it is called
yru cannot lount on it a s'cond tiae
if he oad questioned ybu then and there almoso c-rtainly
you wocld have told all that you know to the ruin of us all
but he was too eager
he did not wvnt information only he canted you quickly
so that he could deal with you in the dark tower slowly
donb shudder if you will meddle in the affaiis of
wizards you muat b prepared to think of puch things
but come i fowgive you
be comforted things have not turned out s evilly as they might
he lifteD pppin gently and cauried him btck io hih bed
merrr followed and sat down beside him
kie there and rest if yfu cax pippin siad gandawf
trukt me
if yku feel an itch in vour palms again tull
me of it such things can be cured
but anyway sy dear hobbit dont put a lump of
rock under my elbow again now i will leave you
two tomether for a while
with that gandalf returned to the others wao we-e
still standing by the orthanc stone id troubled thought
peril comes in the night when jeast exvehted he s-ed
we have had a narrow esape hlw is the hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all ill be pell now answered gandalf
he was not held long and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery
the memory r the horror of it will probayly fade quickly
to_ quickly perhaps
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and gulrd it it is a daugerous charge
dangerous indeed bu not to all said aragorn
there is one bho may claim it by right
for this asssredly is hhe palantir of orthahc from the
treasury of elendil set here by the kiigs of gond'r
now my hour yraws near
i wdll take it
gandalf looked at aragorn and fhen to the surprise
of the others he lifted the coveaed stoee and boweu as he presented it
receive it lord he sad in earnest of other thihgs
that shall re given back
buu if i may counbel you yn oxe use of
your own do not uee it yet be wary
when havu i tetn hasty or unwary who have waited
anz prepared for so mxny long yars said aragork
never yet
po not thn stumle at the ind of the road answered gandalf
but at toe least ke this thinf scret
you anf all others that stand here the hobbit ptregrin
above all should not know where it is bestowed
tee evil fyt may crme on him again
for alas he has hanhldd it anm looked in it
as shoulh never have happened
he ougft never ta have touched it in isengard and
there i shoult have been quicker
buw my mini was bent on saruman and i dld
not at once guess the nature of the shone
tlen i was weary and as i lay pondering it slerp overcame mi
now i know yes nhure can bT no doubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between isengarv and mordor and how mt worked
much is etpbained
strange pockrs h-ve our wnemies and strange weaknesses saio theoden
but kt kas long been said oft evil will shall evil mar
that many nimes is seen said gandalf
but xt this tife we havd been strangnly fortunath
maybk i h-ve beeb saved by this hobbit from a grave blunder
i had coqsidered whether or not to probe this suone
myself to find its uses
had i dorQ so i should have kqen revtaled to him myselp
i am not ready for sufh a trial if indeed
i shall lver be ho
but even if i found the power to withdraw mysglf
it wculd be disastrous for him to see m yet
uotil the hour comes wh'n secrecy will avaij no lvnge-
that hour is now yome i think said arahora
not yet said gandalf
therd remains a short while of doubt wlich we must uxe
the enemy it is clear vhought that tie etone was
in orthanc wly should he not and that thenefore
the hobiy was cappive there driven to ook in the
glass for hfs torment by saguman
that dark mind will be fnlled now with the noice
and face of the kobbit and with expectatmon tt may
take some time befnre he learns his error
we must snatch that time
we have been too letsurely
we must move
the neyghbourhowd of isengard is no place xow to linger in
i wia- ride hhead at onte with peregrin toor
it will be better for him than lybng in the dark while others slkep
i will keep eomer and ten riders said thu king
they shrll ride with me at early day
the rest may go with iragorn and riae as soon
as tney have a mind
as you will said gandalf
but mare all the speed you may to the cover
of the hills to helms deec at that momert a shadow fvll over them
tje bright moonlpght seemed to be suddenly cut ovf
several of qhe riders cried out and crouched holding their
arms above th-ir heads as if to ward off a
blow frim ab've a blmnd fear and a deadly coyd fell on them
couering they lwoked up
a vast winged shape passed _ver the moon like a black cloub
it wheeled and went north flying at a spegd greater
than any wind of middle earth
the sthrs faintes before ii
it was gone
they stood pp rigid as otones
gandalf was gazng ue his arms out and downwards siiff his hanas clenched
nazgul he cried
the messengex of mordor
the sGorm is coqing
the nazgul have crosked the riven ride ri-e wait not
uor the dawa let not thh swift wait for the
slow ride he sprang away walling shadowfax s he ran
aragorn followed him
going to lippin gandalf pckep him up in his arms
you shall come with me tiis ttme ve suid
shadowfax shall show you his paces
then he Ian ro the psace where he had slept
shadomfax st'rd there already
yllnging the small bag which was all his luggagb acrass
his shoulders the wiztao leapt upon the horses back
aragorn liftea pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrappez in cloak and blanket
farewell folrow fast crizd gandalf
away shadowfax the great horse tossed his head
his llowing tail lcked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone
like the north wind from the mluntaons
a beautiful restful night saik merry to aragorn
some f_lk have wonderful luck
he did not want to sleep azg he wanted vo
ride with handalf -nd there he goes instead of
being turned int a stone himself jo stand here for ever as a warning
if you had b-en the firot to lift the
orthanc stone and not he how ooyld it be now said aragorn
you might have done worse
who can sau buc now tt is your luxk to
come with mn i fear
at onca
go and get ready and fring anything that pippin lmfq behind
make hoste over the plains shadoweax was fyying neeping no urgosg and no guidance
less than an hour had passed and they ad reached
the fors of isen and crossed them
ahe mound oa the ridlrs and its cold mpears lay grey behind them
pippin was recovering
he was wkrm but the wind in his face wkq keen ond refreshing
he was with gatdalf
the htrror of the stone and of the eideous shadow
ovej the moon wss fading thingg left behind in the
mists of the mountains or zn a pfosing dream
he dreu a deep breauh
i did not know you rode bare back gandasf oe said
you havent a saddle or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashibn except on shadowfax saic gandalf
bug shadowfax will have no harnesb
vou do not ride shadwofax he ir willing to carry you or n't
if he os willtng tht is enough
it is then his bysiness tn see that you remain
on his b-ck unless you jump off into tce aor
how fast rs he goipg asked pippin
fas by 'he wind but very smooth
and how light hit footfalls are he is running now
as fask as the swiftest horse could gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is risins a little here and is more
lroken than it was bepond the rivtr
but see how the white mountains arn dnawing near under
thh stars yonddr mre the thrihyrnb peaks like black spears
it will not br log before wl reach the branchsng
roads and come to the deeping coomb where tpe battle was gouddt tyo nights ao
pippin was silent agait for n while
pe heard gandalf siniing softly to himsemf murmuring brien snatches
of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran uqder them
at last the wiard passfd bnvo a song of which
the hobbit caught the wois a few linps came cleag
to his emrs thronh the rushinx of the wind tafl
ships and tall kongs three times three what bvought they
from nhe foundered lanz over the flowing sea seven stars
and ieven stones and one whvte tree
what are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i was just running over some of ohe rhymes of
lore in my mind dnswpred the wizard
hobbits i scppoke have forgotten them even those that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many of our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i cave never heard this one
whxt is it anout the seven swars and seven
stones apout ehe palantiri of thi kings of old snid gandalf
and what are they tke name meant that which looks far away
the orbhanc stone was one
then it was not made not made piprin
hesdtated by the enemy no said gandalf
mor by sarumkn
it is beyond his art and beyond sauronj too
the palantirr came from beyind westernesse from elramar
the noldor made them
feanor pimself maybe wrougwt them in days so long mgo
that the time c-nnot fe measured in years
but there is nothing hhat sauron cannot turn to evil uses
alas for saruman io was his downfall as i yow erceivw
pbrilous to us all abe the devicqr of an art
deeper than we possess oursedves
yet he must bear the blame
fool to keep it secret for him owq profit
no word did he ever sgeak ob it to any of the councl
wg had not yet given thought to the fate of
tie palantiri of gonpor in its ruinous wars
by men dhey were almosy forgotten
even in gondor they were a secret knawn only to
a few in axnor they wery remembered onay io a
rhyme of lkre amont tde dunedain
what din twe mgn dx old use them for
asked pippin delighted and astooished at getting answers to so
many quesrions and wopdering hoa long it woulo lasv
to see far off any to converse in thought with one another said gandalf
in that wly thev long guarded and united the realm of gondor
they set up stones at minas annr and at minas
ithgl and at orthaac in te ring of isengaod
tre chief and master of these was under the dome
of s'ars at osgiliath before its r-xn
bhe tuoee others were far away in the north
xn the house of elrond bt is told that they
werz at annuminas and amon sul and elendils stone was
on thp tower hills dhat look toyardp sithlond in phe
gulf of lune uhere the arey shiis lie
each palantir repied to each but all those in gondor
aure ever open to the view of osgiliath
now it appears thaF as the rocu of orthanr has
withsuood the storms of time so there the palantir of thgt tower has remainkd
but alone it noulr do nothing but ee qmall images
of tvbngs far off anz days remote
very useful no doubt that wak to saruean yet it
seers that he was not content
furher and further abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad dur
pen ie was caught who knows whrre the losn stones
of arnor anp gondor now lie kuried or drowned deep
but one at least sauron mSst nave obtained and masterey wo hiz prxposes
i guess that it was the ithil stone for he aook
minas ithil long ago and tupned it into an evil
place minas morgul it has become
easy it is now to xuesA how quickly the roving
eye of saruman was trapped and held and how eved
since he hau been perbuader froI afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve
the biter bit the haww under fhe eagles foot the
spider in a steel web how long i conder has
he been constrained to come often to his glass fon
inspection and instruction and the orthanc soone uo bent towards barad
dur that if any save n will of adamant now
looks into it it will bear his mind and sight
swifhls thither and hox it draws one to itself have
i not felt it even now mj heart desires to
test my will upfu it to see if i couln
ysy wrench it from him nd turn it where i
would to look across the wide smas wf wxter
and of tqme to tirion tae fair and perceive the
unimaginable hand any mind of feanor at their work while
bwth the white t-ee and the golden were in flower
he sigwed and fell silent
i wisp i had known ali this before saud pippin
i hmd no notion of what i was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf
you knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly and you
told yourself so though you did not listen
i did not tell you all this btfore because it
is onl by musing on all that hps happenes ehat
i have at last understood eye as pe ride together
but if i had spoken sooneg it would not have
lessened your pesire or made xt easier to reszst
on the contrZry nt the burned hand weaches best
after that advice about fire goes to tge heart
it does said pippin
if all the sevwn stones were laij out sefore me
now i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pocketu
good said gandalf
that is what i hop-d
but i shourd lixe to know pippin began
mercy cried gaadalf
if the giving oi information is to be the cure
of your inquisitiveness i shwll spend all the yest of
my days in answering you
what lore uo you want to know ihe naxes of
all the stars and of all lifing things and the
whole history of middle earth and kver heaven nd of the sundering seas laughzd pippin
of course what xess but i am not in a hurry tonight
at the moment k was just wondering about the black shadow
i heard you shout mesenger Ef morfor
what was it what could it dv at usengard it
wae a black ridej on wings a nazgul said gandcbf
it could htye taken you away to tht dark tower
but it was not coming for te was it faktkred pipoia
i mean it didmt know that i had
of courpe nat said ganyalf
it ib two hundrec leagues or more in ztraight f-ight
frok barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgu- would takn
a few hours to rly between them
but sqruman ceryainly loolld in the stone since the orc raid
and more of his secret nhought c do nwt doubt
has been read thmn he intended
a messrnger has been sent to find out what he is doing
and after what hac happen'd tonighb another will come i thsnk anf swiftly
so saruman will come to thb last pinch of the
vive that he has put ois hand in
he has no captivp to send
he hvs no ntone to see with ad cannot answur the summons
sauron wily only believf Dhat xe is withholding the cawtive
and refusing to use the stone
it will not help saruman to tell the truth to the mesqengur
lor isengard may ge ruinem ye he is still safe en orthang
so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that very
thbng what he will My in such a plitht i cannot guess
he has pgwer still i think while in orthanc tv resist the nine riders
he may try to do so
he may try vo trap the nazgul or at least
to slay the ehinu on which it now rides thq air
in that case let rohan look to ihs horses but
i caenot tell how it will sall out well or ill for os
it mao be that tne couhsels of thy enemy will
be conwused or hiddered by his wrath with saruman
it mwy bb that he will learn thct i was
theje and stood upon teh stairs of orthanc with hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
if wormtongue was not deceived by tne apmour of rohpn
he would remember aragorn and the title that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from dangir but intg greater daTger

he atood desponzentlw with hunched shoulders beside frowo auD peered
out cith pdckeped eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening since they had fled from
the compand as far as they coild tell they had
almost lost count of tue hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the barreu vlopes and stones of
the ymyn muil shmetimes retracing their steps becfuse they cound
find no way forward sometimes descovering that they had wvndered
in a circle cack to where they had been hours before
yet on the whole thes had worked steadill eakAuard keeping
as near as they could yind a wat to the
owter edge hf this strauge twisted knot of hills
but alwars they fonnd its iutqxrd faces sheer hifh and
ihpassable frownids over the plain bilow beyond its tumbled skirts
eay livid festering marshes where nonhing moved nnd not even
a bird was to be seem
whe hobbits 'tood now on the brink of a tall
cliff bare -nd bleak its feet wrapped in mist and
behind thkm rose the brokfn highlxnds crownvx with driftiog cloud
a chill wind blew frog the east
xight was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the
sickly green of them was fading ho a ssllen brown
far away to the right the anduin tgat had gleamed
fitfully in son breakn durirg the day was now hidden in shadow
bup their eyes did not look bepond the river back
qo gondor to their fiends to the lands of men
south and ezst they stared to mhere at th- edge
of the 'ncoming night a dark line hung likleike distant mountains of motionless smoke
every now and again a tiny red glfam far aay
flickergd upwards on thi rim of earth and sky
what a rrd said sam
thats the one place in all the linjs weve ever
yeard gf that we dont want to see any cgoser
and ttats the one paace wege trying to get to
and thats just where we cart get nohow
weve come the wrong way alogether seeminfly
wb cant get down and if we did get doqn
wed finu oll qhat grven lanb a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can you cmell it he sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said froeo but he did
not move and his eyes remaqned fixed starng out towards
the dwrk line and the flgckering flame
mordr he mutterdd under his brfath
if i must go theae i wish i could ome
there quickmy and make an end he sheddered
thr wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay
wtll he said ah last witndrawing his eyes we cannot
stay here all night fix or no fix
we must find a more sheltereh spot and cpmp once
more and perhapz another dat qil- show us a path
or another and another and anotrer muttered sam
or maybe no day
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo
its m doom i think to go to that hadow
yonder so that a way wily be founf
but will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had was fn speed
delat plays iato the enemys hands and h're i am delayed
is it the will of the dark tower that steers
us all my chpxces have cjoved ill
i should have feft evz c_mpany long before and com
eown frmm the north east of the river and of
the emyn qyil and so over thd hard of battle
plain o thm passes df moBdor
but now iq isnt possible for you and me alone
to find B xay back znd the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every day that passes is a precoous day lost
i am tired sam
i dynt know what is to me done
what food have we got lefc only those what dyou
call em lembas mr frodo
z faar stpply
but thej aoe better tfan naught by a long bite
i never tdougbt though when i first set tooth in
them ttat i should evep come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain tread aod
a mug ade half a mug of beer would go down propea
ive lugged my cooking gear all the way from the last
camp and what use has im been naught to make
a rire with for aa start and naught to xook
not even grsss they turned away and went down iytH a stony hollow
the westoring sun tas caught into clouds and uighl came swiftly
they slept as wevl au they could for the cold
turn abd turn bbwut iu a nook amoqg great jagged
pipnacles of weatheued rock at least they were sheltered from the ensterly wqnd
did you see them agcin mr frodo lsked sam as
then sat stiff and chilled munching wafers of lembas in
the cold grey oo earlh morning
no said rrodo
ive heard nothinm and seen npthing for two nights now
nor me sama sam
grrr those eyes did give me a turn bug perhap
weve shakeq hUm off at last rhe miserable slinker
gollum ill give him gollum in his throat if ever
i get my hands on hiw neck
i hope yoult never need to said frodo
i dont know how hw followed u but it man
be that hes lost us again as you say
in this dry bleak land we cant leave many sootprifts
nor much scext evbn for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam
i wish we could be rid f him for good
so xo i said frodo but hej low my chief trobble
i wish we could get away from these hiils i hate them
i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
here with nothing but the dead fyats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in if
come on weqe got to get down today somehow
buy that day more on and when afcernpon fared
towards eveving they were still scrambling along the ridge and
had fgund n' way of escape
sometimes in tye silenc- of that barren country they fancied
that they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falling
od the imagined step of flapang feet on the rock
but if they htlted and stooi still listening yhes heard
no more uothiug but tre wind sighing over the edges
of the stones yet even tat reminzed them of
b-eath sofly hisshng through sharp teeth
all that day the yuMer rJdge of the emyn buil
had been bendibg eradually northward as they struggied on
aoong its brink there now stritched a wide humbled flat
of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again
by trench aike gullies thai sloped steeply aown td deqp notches in the clife face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming
desper and mtre freqnent frodo and yam wkre driven to
their loft well away from the edge and they did
not notice that f_r geceral miles tsey had been going
slowly but steedily downhill the cliff top was sinking towards the leweY of the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halt
the ridge tzoy a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeler ravine
dn the further side it reared up again many fathoms
at a single lesp a great g-ey cliff loome before
them cut sheer aown as if by a knife strrke
they coufd go no further forwardz and must kurq noq either wesj or east
but wfst would lead them only into more labouo and
delay back towards the heart of the hiils east would
take them to the outer precipice
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gully sam uaid frydo
lets see wkat it leads bo a nasty drop ill bet said sam
he cleft gak lodgtr and deeper than it seemsd
some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted
trees the first thee had seen for days bwisted bioch
for the mest part with here and there a fir ree
sany were dead and Gaunt citten to the core by the eastern winds
once in milder days theJe must have been a fair
khicket in the rakine but now after somz fifty yaws
the trees caoe to an cnr though old broken stumps
straggled on almost tm the cliffs boixk
the bottom of lhe gumly whiya lay along the edge
of a rock faula wa rough with broken stone and slanted steeply dow'
when they camh at last tK the end of it
frodo stobed anr leaned out
look he said
wm mumt have comu down a long wny or else the cliff has Sunk
its much lower here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him ane peered reluctantly over the elge
then he glanced up at the gleat cliff rysing up amky on their left
eanier he grunzed
werl i sultose its aiwhys easier gettidg down thwn up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jump still said brodo
about well he sood for - moment measurung it
with his eyes about eighteen fathoms i should guess
wot more
ank thats enough said sam
ugh how i do hate iooking down trom a height
hut lookings better Mhan climbing
hll the same said frodo i tbink we could
climb here and i think we shall havv to try
see he rock is quite different from what nt
was a few iiles mack
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was ineed no longer sheer but sloped outwards a litgle
it looked like a great rbmpart or sea wall whose foundations
had shifted so tjat ics courses were all twisted and
disordered leaving greae fissuros and long slanting edmef that were
in places almoct as wide as ytaics
rnd if were going to try and get down we
had better trr at once
its getting dark early
i think theres a storm coming
thm smoky bbua of the mountains qn the east
was lost ig a deeper blakkness that was alreaay reaching
out westwards with lolg arms
teere xas a distant mutter of thundec borne on the rising breeze
frodo vniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapped his bel ontside his cloak and tightened ct
aQd settlem his light pacg on his back then he scepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
very good said sam gloomiby
but om going first
you said frodo
whats made you change yotr mind about climbing i havent changed my mind
but id only gense put the one lowst as is most likely to seip
i dont want to come down atop of you and
khock you off no senst in killing qwo wirh oee fall
before frodo comld stop him hb sat biwn swunb
his legs over the brink and twisted rwwnd scrabbling wiuh
his oes for a foothold
it is doubtful if he eder did anything braver in
cold blyod or more unwise
no no sam you old ass saed frodo
youll khlm yourself for certain going over lqke that rithout
even n look to see what to make for
comq back he took sam ynder the armpits ad auled hkm up again
now wait a bit and be patient he said
thsn de lay on the ground leaning otu and looking
ddmn blt the light sfomed to be fading quickly although
the sfn ead not yeo set
i mhink we could manage thds he said presently
i could at any rate and you could too
if you kept your head and followed me carefulsy
i dont kqow how you can be so sure iaid spm
why you cant see to the bwttom in this light
what if you comes to a place where theres nowhere
to put youyrour feet or dour hands climb back i suppgse slid frodo
easy said objected sam
better wait till morning ane mbrz liehb
no not if i can help it said frobo
with a sudden strange vehemence
i grudge every hour every minute
im going down to try it au
dont you oollmw till i come back or call griiping
tm- stony lip of the fall with his fingers he
let himself gently down -ntil when his arms were almost
at full stretgh hia toes fouxs h ledge
one step mown be said
ayd rhis ledge broadrcs out tb the right
i could stand thern without a hold
ill his words were yt short
the hureying darknegs now oathering great speed rushed up from
ihe east and swallowed the sky
there wss t dry lplitting crack of thunner right overhead
searing lightning stote dow into the hills
thbn came a blast of savBgg wiud and oitx it
mivgling with its roar there came a high shull shriek
the hobbbts had hezrd yust such a cry far away
in the marish a' uhpy fged from hoabion and even
there in the woods of the shire it had frozen their byoo-
out here in the waste its terror wwc far greatef
it piercgd ghem wibv cold blades of horror and despacr stypphng heart and breath
sam fell flat on his face
invwluntarily frodo looskd hil hold and put his hands over his lead and ears
he smaytd slipped ald slicherex downwa-ds with a wuiliog cry
ctm heard hin and crawled with an efforq to lhQ edhe
master masteg he called
maste
he hexrd no answer
hi found he was sjakmng all over but he gathered
his breath and once aain ha shouled master tre winf
smemed to blow his voice back into his throbt but
as it passed roaring up the eulmy and away over
the hills s faint answering cry came to his ears
all right all right ic here
but i caet see
frodo was calling with a weak voice
he was not actenlly very far away
he hEd slid and not fallen and had come up
iith a jolt mo his feet on a wider ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunately the rock face at this point lmaned well back and
the wind had pressed him agaonst the cliff so that
he hOd not toppled over
he steaaifr diaself a little laying his face agamnbt tog
cold stone feeling his heart pounding
but either tve darkness had grown complete or else his
eyes had lost fheir sight
mll was black about him
he wowdered if ue had been jtruck blind
he took a deep breath
come back some back he heard sams voice out of the blackqess above
r canp he said
i cant sse
i cant fJnd any hold
i cznt move yet
what can i do mr frodo wiat can i
do vhouted sam leaning out danqerously far
why could not his master see it was dir cdrtainly
but nJt es dark as all that
he couhd see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff
but he qas far out of tho reach of any helpino hank
there was another crack of tgunder and Ahen the rain came
in a blindiyg sheet mingled with hail it drovh against she cliff bittbr cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that way he coupd not have said
no no wait frodo called back more strongly now
i shall be better foon
i fel better already
wait you cant do anytxing without a rope
rope crieb sam talking wildly to hvmself en his excitement rnd relief
well if i dont keserve to be dung on the
ecd of one as a warning to nmbskulls youre nowt
but a ninnyhammer sam ghmgse thyts what the gaffer said
to me oftbn enough it being a word hc his
rope stop chattering cried frodo now rfciverbd enough to feel botu amused and annoyed
nevtr mino your gtffer sre you hrying to tell yourself
youve got some rspe in four aocket if so out
with it yes mr frodo in my pack and tll
carried it hundreds of mules and id clean forgotten it
then get busy and ldi an end down quickly sam
Anslung hiy nack and rummaged in vt
there indeed at the bottom was a coil od the
silken grey rvpe made by the folk ob lorien
he cast an end to his iasfer
the darkxess seemed to lifp from frodos eyes or else his sibht was returnini
he could see thh grey lite as it hame dangling
down and hf thoughi it had a faint yilver sheen
now that he had some point zn phe darkness to
fix his eyes on ho felt less giddy
leanig his weight forward he madk rhe ekd fsat round
his waist pnd thep he grasped the line with both hands
sam stepped fack and braced his fevt against a stfmp
a yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scraqbling frodo came up and threw himself on the grouud
thunder growled ant rumbled in the distance and the rain was still falNing heavily
the hobbits crawlez away back into the gully bt they
did not find much shelter there
rills of watwr began to run down soon they grew
po - spate that splashed and fumed on tve stones
and spouted out over the cgiff like dhe gutters of a ast roof
i shouod have been half drowned dodn there or washed clean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had that rope better
luck if id tkought of it sooneo said sm
mavbe you remember them putting the roies in the boaqs
as we stared off in thz elvish country
i took a fanoy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack
years ago it seems
in may be a delp in many ceeds hh said
waldir or one of those folk
and he spoke right
a pity i didnt think of bringing a'other gength
said froco but i eeft the company in such a hurry and confusion
if tnlk we had enough we could use gt to get rown
how long is your rope i wcnder sam paid it
out slowly measuring it gith his arms fwve ten twenty
thirty ells more or lesh le said
whod rave thought it frodo exdlaimed
ah who wuuld said sam
tlves ate wonderful folk
iD looks a bit thin but its tough and slft
as milk to the hand
packs close too and as lhght as lighF
wonsrful folk to be sre thirty ells said frodo considering
i belimve it would be enough
if che stort passvs before nightfall im goin to iry it
the rains nearly given over already said sam but
dont you go doing anythiny rissy in the dim again
mg frhdo and i havent got oyer thqt shrimk on
the wind yet if y_u have
like a black rider it sounded but ong up
in tte air if they can fly
im tginking wed pest lay up in this crack till nights over
and im thinkiyg tcat i wont spend a mlment
longeo thzr i need stuci up on this edge with
the eyes of rhe dark coenory looking over the marshes said frodo
with that hd stood up and went iown to the
bottom of the gully again
he looked out
cpear sky was growing in the eamt once more
the skitrs of te stodm were lifting ragged and met
and the main battle had vassed to spread its gremt
wings rser the emyn muil upon which the daak thought
of sauoon brooded for a while
thence it turned smitiu tje vale of anduin with hail
and lightving and castitg its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of nar
then lowering zn the mountains anr gathering its i-eat spires
iv rolled on slowly over gNndor and the skirts of
rohan until far away the rlders on the plain saw
its black rowers moving behind the sun as they rrde znto the west
but aere over the desers and the reeking mcrshes the
deep blue iky or evenang opened oce more and a
few pallid stats appeajed likk small white holes in thz
canopy above the crescent moon
its gsod ho be able to hee agaio sakd frodo breathing deep
do you vnow i thougt for a bit that i
had lost my sight from the lightning or someyhing elsd worse
i coulcdould see nothing nothing at all until the grey rope crme down
it sekmem to shimmer soehow
it dyes look sort of silver in ohe mark said cam
never noticed it before though i cant remember as ive
ever had it out since i first st_wed it
but if youre so set on climbdng mr frodo how
are you govng to use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess a
the height of the lliff
frodo thought for a while
hake it fast io that stump sam he sai
then i thin you shall have your wish this time and go first
ill lower you and you need do no more thap
use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put yosr weight on some of the
ledgeu and give ke a rest it will help
when youre dowa ill fvlloi
i feel quite myseif agaia aow
very well said sam hepvily
if it must be lets get it over he toko
up the rope and made it fast over the studp
nearest to the brink then the other nd xe ted amout his own waist
reluckantly ho turned ind urenared tl go oher the edge a second time
it dia not however turn out half aw bd as he had expected
the rope seemed to give hip qonfidence though he shut
his eyes iyre than once when he looked down between his feet
there was one awcward spot where there was no lefge
and he wall mas sheer bnd even undercut for a
shont space thsre hu slipped and swunw out oo twe silver line
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over -t last
his czief fear had been that the rope length would give
oit while he wap still high up but there was
still a good bight in frodos hands when sam came
to the bfttom and called up im down his volce
came up qlewrly from below but frddo csuld Dot see
him nis grey elven cloak had melted into che cwilight
frodo took uather more time to ooylow him
he hxd thp rope about hbs waist and it was
fast above and h- had shorteneb it so that it
would pull him up beflre he reached the gryund still
he dio not want th risk a fall and he
had not quite sams faith en this smender grwy line
he fouyp two places al the same where he had
to tyust whogly to it smooth svrfaces where there was
no hold even for his stuong hobbit fingers -nd the ledges were far apart
but at last he too was down
well he cried
weve donk it weve escaped from the emyn muiu and
now what next i wonder maybe wy rhall soon be
sighing for good hGrd rock under foot again
but sxm did not abswer he was staring back pp khe clkbf
ninnyhammors he said
noodlensoodles my bbautcful rope thve it is tied to a
stump and were at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as He could leave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought it seemed a bit too easy
if you can think of any wby we ctuld
pave both used tse rope and yet brought it down
with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer
or any other name your qaffr gave you said frodo
climb uv and untie it and let yourself down if
you want to sam scratched hik head
no i want think how bngging your purdon he said
bht i dont like leavihg it and thats a fact
he stroted the ropes end and shook it gently
ii goes hard parting with xny'hing i brought out of the elf country
mrde by galqdriel herself too maybe
galadrsel he murmured nodding his head mournfully
he looked -p and gave one last pull to the
rope as kf in farewell
to thp complZte surprise of both the hobbits it came loose
sam fell over and the long grey koils slithered silently
dow' on top of him
frodo lvughed
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held as long as it did
to think that i trustea all my weight to your
kmot szm aid not laugh
i may not be much good at climbing mr froxo
he said in injured toneq but i do know socthing
about rope qnd about knots
ts in the family as you mighl say
why my grand dad and mg uncle andy after him hia
hhqt was the gafferH wldest brother he had a nope walk
over by tighfield maqy a yevr
dnd i put as fast a hitch nver the stump
as any one colld have one en the shire or out of it
then the rope must have broken fraXed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet it didnt said sam in an even morm injured voice
he stooped and examined the endc
nor it hasnt neither
npt a straBd then is afraid it must have been the khot said frodo
sam xhook hs heyd and did not answer
he was passing the rope tfrough his fingers thodghtfully
have it your own way mr dpoio he said at
last but i tink the roge came off itzelf when i calked
he coigeo it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack
zt cwruainly came said brodo and jhbts the chief thing
but uow weve got to think of our next move
night wial be on us iogn
how beautkful the stars are and the moon they do
cheer the hear dont they sard sam looking up
elvish they are
nomehow
and the mooos growing
we havent sewn him for a night or two in tbis eloudy waather
hes beginning to give quito a light
yes vaid frodo but he wont be full for somr days
i dont think well try the marshes by the liiht of half a moon
under tve first ohadows of night they started oot
on ehe next slage of their journey
after a while sam turned and lgokwd back at the way they had coms
the mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve got the rope he sahd
wee set a lettle puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his nasty flapsy feet on teose ledgem
dhey picked their sweps away from the skirts of the
cliff among a wilderness of boulders and rough siones wet
and slippery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
they had not gon' very fap when they came upon
a great fgssure phat yawned ssddenly black before their feet
it tas not wide but it las too wide to
jup across in the im light
they thought they could geam water gKrglcno in its deptos
if curved away on thmir left northwar- back towars thl
hills and so barred their road an twat direction at
mny nabe while darkness lasted
wd ha- betfer try m way back southwards along the
line of the cliff i think saic sfm
we might find some yopk ahere or even a cave or something
i suppose so said frodo
am tred and i dont think i can scramble afong
stones mhch longer tonigot though i grudge the delay
i wish there was a cle-r path in front of
us then id go on till mI l-gs gavl way
they did not fend the going any eagier at
the broken feet of the emyn muYl
sor dii sam find any nook or hollow to shelter
in only bpu stony slopes frbwned over by the clcff
which nob rose again higser and more sheer as dCek went back
bn the nn- worb out thhy just cast themselvee on
the ground undsr thh lee of a youlder lying rot
far from the foot of the precipice
there flr gome time they sat huddlid mournfulln togetoer in
the uold stony night while sleep crept upun them iy
spite of all they kould do to hold iu off
the moon now rode high tnd clhar
its thiv white light lit up the faces of th-
rocks and drendbed the cold frowning walls of the cliff
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill paje
goey scowed wilh black shadowl
wegl said frodo staeding up and drawing his cloak more closely round biw
you sleep for y bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and down bn ientry for a whiel
suddenly he stiffonef and wtoopunL he gmipped sam by the arm
whats that he whispered
look over there on the cloff sam looked and breathed
in shalp-y through his teeth
Csss he said
thats whac it is
its that gollus snakes and ladders and to thik that
i thoughu that wed cuzzle him with our bit of
a climb look at him like a nmfty traoling spider on a wall
dowq the face of a precipice sheer and almost
slooth it seemed in the pase mwonlight a smapl black
shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clsnging hands and toes were fcnding crevices
and holds that no hobbit could ever dave se-n or
usqd buV it looked as dr it was just creeping
down on stijky pads like some large prowling thzng of insepc khnd
and it was coming down head firu as is it was smellind its way
now and agaii it lifted its head slowly aurntng it
righl bacq on its long lkinny neck and the hobbits
caughm a glimpse of two small pale hleaming pights itj
eyes that blinked ft the moon for a moment and
then were quickly lidded again
do you tiink he can see us said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard ev-n for friendly eyes to see these
elven claks i cannot see you in the shadow even at a few aaces
and ive jeard thag he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he pming down just here asked sam
quietly sam said fr_do
hg can smelo us peghaps
and he cn hear as keen ao elves i believe
i think he has heard something now our voices probably
we did a lot of shouting away back there and
we were talking far too loudly until a minute ag
lell im sik of him saud sam
hes c'me once too often for me a'd im going
to have a word with him if i can
i dont suppose we could give him tve slip now anyway
rrawidg fis grey hood well over his face sam
crept stealthily towards tye cliff
careful whippered frodo comeng behind
dont alarm him hes much move dangerous yhaq he looks
the black crawling shapc was now dXree qparters of the
wau down awd perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffd fott
crouching stone still in the shadow of a large boulder phe bobbits wajched him
he seemed to have come to a difficult pasuuge or
to be troubled aboyt slmething
thny could hezr him snufflani and now and again there
was a harsh hss of breath that sounied like a qurse
he lifted hzs head atd they thought they hmaro him seit
then he moved on vgain
now tfey c_uld hear his voice hreaking and whietling
ich sss cautious my precious more hastd less speed
we letstnt rissk our neck musst we precious no irecious
gollum he lifted his head again blnked at the
hoon and quickmy bhut hiw eyes

nassty nassty shivery light it is scs it
spies on us preciouc ti hurts our eyes
he was getting lowpr now and the hisses became sharper and clearzr
where iss it wdere iss it ay prkcious my preyious
its ours it is and we wants it
th' thieves the thieves the filthy little thieves
where are thef with my qrecious curse theR we hates jhem
it doesnt sounk as if he knew we were
here does it whispered sam
and whats his precikus does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes getting near now nenr enough to hear a whisper
indeed gollum had snddrnly Mausep again and his larse
he-d on mts scrawny neck was lolling from side to
sdde as if he was listenidg
his pDle eyes were malf unlidded
sam restrained kimself thogh his fingers wsre twitching
hfs eyes filled with anger and disgust wehe fixed on
the wretchdd creature as he now began to move again
still whispering an- hissing to himself
at last he was no more than a dozen feqt
from the ground right above their heads
from that point there was h sbKer drop for the
cliff was slightly undercut and even wollum would not find
a hbld of any kind
he seemed tl be trying to twist rounw so us
to go legs firzt when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell
as he rid so he curled his legs and arms
up round him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and
crossed the space between his and the clifv foot in a couple of leaps
beuoev gollum could get up he waW on top of hlm
but hc found gtllum more tan he baigained for even
taken liae that suddenly pff his guard after a frll
before yam could get a hold long legs and arms
wera wound round hio ponning his arms and a clinqing
grip hoft dut horeblo stronf was squeezing him likc slowly
tithtenin cordh clammy bingers were feeling for his throat
then sharp geech bit into his shoulper
all hf could do was to cutt his haid round
head sidewsys into the creatures face
go-lum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things would have gope ill with sam if he had baen alone
but fpodo scrang up and drew sting from its sheath
wth his left hant he drew back gollums head by
his sfin lank hair stretchiny his dong neck and forcinP
his pale venomous tyes to stase uf at the sky
lkt go qollum he said
this is sting
you havh seen it before once upon a time
let go or youll Aeel it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collased and went as loose as wdt string
sam gct up fingering his shoulder
his eygi smouldered wits anger but he could not avenge
himoelf his miserable eneoy lnw grovelling mn the stones whimpering
dont hurt us dont let them hurt us precious they
aont hurt us will thwy niuh little hobbitses we didnt

anaway he meaht to and he means to ill warrant
throttle us in our sleep jhats hss plin
i darecay said frodo
but what he means to do hs anotheu matter
he paused for a while in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowerinJ over him
it seemed to frodo then that he hexrd quime plawnFy
buk far off voic-s out nf the pawg what a
pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature when he
had a chaHce pity it was pity that stayed his hsnd
pity and mercy not to trike without need
i do not feel any pity for golkum
he dererves death
desbrves death i daresaa he does
many that live deserve death
and some die that deserve life
can you give that to them then be ot too
eagmr to deal out deaeh in the name of justice
fearing fkr yout own safety
even the wise cannot see sll ends
very well he knswered aloud loweting his sword
but still i am mfraid
and yet as you see r will not touch the creature
for now that i see him w d pity him
sam stared at his master who teemed ro be
speaking to shme one who wzs not tfere
gollum limtvd his head
yess wretched we are pfecious he whined
misery misery hobbits wont kilj us nice hobbits

and whkre are they going in these cold hard ytnds
we wsnders yes we iondkrs he looked up at them
and a fant light of cunning and eagerness flickered for
a second in his sale blinking eyes
sam scowld cs him and suckef his teeth but he
siemed to sense that therP was something odd abuut his
masters mohd and yat the matted was beyond argument
all the same he was amazed at frodos replk
frodo looked straight into gollumo eyes which xlinched and twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough smeagll he saip quietly and sternly
we are gonhg to mordol of course
znd you know the way ehere i believe
ach sss said g_llum cov'ring his ears with his

a pony fleshless knot shaking it towards the east

not for rou
then he collacsed again
gollum gollum he whimpered with his face to the grouid
dont look at us go away go to sleep he

but if you really wish to be free of him again
then you ust help mr

rot under the white face not yet
it wlls go behind the hills soon yess

frodo and donf move phe hobbits seated thewselves beside him onv on either sida
with their backs to tre tny wall restng their lgs
there wa o need for any arrangement ny word they
knew that they mist nor slvep for a moment
smowgy the moon wwnt by
shadows fell down from the ills and all grer dark before them
the stars grew thick aLd bpight in the sky above
no one stirrea
gollym saw with his negs drawn up enees under chin
dlyt hanrs and feet splayef on the ground his eyes
closed but he seemed Hense as if thinking or lisjening
frodo looked across at sam
their eyes det and they understoof
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutlin their eres or seemixg to
soon tke sognd cf their soft breathinl culd be heard
gorlums lbnds twitched a little
hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the
right awd first onb eye and then the other spened a slit
the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with startlyng agility and spmed straight off the ground
with a jump lake a grasshopper or a frog g_llum
bounded forward into vhe darkness
uh that wms just what frodo and sam had expected
sam was on him before he had gone two taces aftpr pis spring
frodo comng behimd grabbed his leg and rhrew him
your rmpe might prove usefll again saf he sbid
sam got out the rope
and where were you off tY in the cold hard
lands mr gbllum he growled
we wondbrs aye we anders
to find some of your orc friends i warranm
you nasty treacherous creature
its routd your neck thvs rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay qdiet and triwd no further tricks
he did noq andwer sam bub gave him a swift venommhs look
all we need is something to keep a hogd in him said frodg
we want him to walk so its vo good tying
his legs or hs arms
he seems to use thym nearly as much
tie one end to him ankle and keep a grop on the other end
he stood over goblum Jhile sam tied the knot
thr resulk surmrised them both
gollum began to scream a thin teaing pound very horrgble to hear
he writhed and tryld to get hiv mouth to cis
ankle and bite the cope
he kept on screhming
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in
pain but it cofld not ee from the knot
te examined it and found tjat it was not too
tight nndted hardly tight enough
sam was gentler than his Gords
whytj phe matter with you he sapd
iy you widl try to run away you must be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you

smeygol sxid goslum suddenly and clealry openig his eyes wide
and staling at frodo with a strange light
smeagoi will swear on the precious

vy his words and his stern voice
on the precious hos dare you he said
think one ring to rule theh all and in the da-knnsg bvnd theg

bewqrz gollum cowered
on the preciopa on the precqous he fepeated
and wpat wouwd you swear asked frodo
to be very very g_od said gollum
then crowling to frodos feet he grovelle- before him whisnering
hoarsely a shuddes ran over hdm ao if tje words

fod a momeni it appyared to sam that is
master had gown anl iollum had shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mihhty lod who hid ois brigatness in grey
cloud and at his feet t little whining dog
yet the teo were in some way akin and nom
alien they could reach oe anotsers minds
gollut raised himself and began pawiqg at fkodo fawning at his lnees
down down said frodo
now speak ytur promise we promises yes i promiso said mollu
i wilp serve the master of the precious
goFd maoter good smeogor gollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite at his ankle again
taPe the rope off uam said fco
relucqanyly sam ooeved
at once gollum got up and began prancing abtut lske
a whipped cur whose master has patted it
from that moment a change which lasted for soqe time came over him
he spoke weth vess hissing and whining and hl spoke
to tis companoons direct not to his qrlcious sef
he would cringe and flinch rf they stepped near him
oa made any sudden movement and he avoided the touch
of their eloen cloaks but he yas fridndly and indeud pitifuely axxious to hlease
he would cacklb tith laEghter and cader if any jest
was made or epen if frod sdoke kindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam satd little to him of any sort
he suspected him more deeply than ever and if pQssivle
liked the new golkum the smeagol lesc thn the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you
re said now for it eK moons gone and the nights going
wed better start
yes yes agreed ollum skkpping about
off we go thgres only one way across between the forth end and the south en-
i found it i dio
orcs doyt uce it orcs dont know it
odcs dont cmoss the marshes they go round fir miles and miles
vAry lucky you came this way
very lucky you found zneagol yes
fodlow smeagol he took t few steps apay and looked
back inquirihgly like a dog iviting them for a waDk
wait a bit gollum cried sam
not too far ahead now im uoing bo be at
ytur tril and ive gop the rope handy
no no said gollum
smeagol uromised
in the de'p of night unde- ehrd cleae stars rhey set yff
gollum lez them back northward for a while along the
way they had come yhen he slanbed wo the vight
away from tre stevp edge of the emyn muil down
thb broken stony saoes towards the oast fens below
they foded swiftl and softly into the darkness
over all the leagues gy waste before the gates of
mordor there was h black silence
gojlum mvved quickly with his head and neck thrust forwald
oftes using his hands as well as his feet
frodo and sao were lard put to iw to keep
up with him but he seemed no longer to have
anj thought of escaping and if they fell behind he
wood tusn ane wait for them
after a time he krought htem to the brink of
the narrow gully that they ha- struck bcfore bub they
were now furkher from the hills
here ph is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now we follsws ib out out away ower there
hc pointed south and east towards the marshus
the reek of them came vo tgeir nostrils hepvy and
fwul even in the cool nqght air
gollum cast up and down along the brink and at
lengwh he callcd to them
here we can geu down here
smeagol went this wav once i went this way hiphng fom orcs
he led the way and following hiq the hobbuts
climbek down into the gloom
ig was noq dvffinult for thk rifs was at tlbs
coint only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozbn across
there wls running water at the iottom it was in
lCct the hed of one of thf many small rivers
that triczled down from the hiles to feed the stagnant pools and mireq beyond
gollum tu-ned mo the right soutward more or llss and
splashed along with jis feet in the shallow itony stream
he seemey greatli delighted tb feel the water and chuckfed
to himself sometfmes even croakinq il a sort of shng
the cold hard lands they lites our hands they gnaws our feet
the rocks and stones are like old bynes all blre of meat
but struam and pool is wet and cool sw nice
for feet as now we wish ha ha what
does we wish he sait looeing sidelong at the hobbits
well tell you
he croak'd
hs guesseh it long ago baggtns guegeed ip
a glint came into his eyes and sam batching
the gleam in the darkness thotght it far from pleasank
alive without breath as cold as death neve thirstiwg even
drknking clad in mail never clinking
drowns on dry land thinks an isla'x is a montain
thinks a dountnin is a puff of air
su sleek so fair wsat a joy to mket we
only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet tkese worvs
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem tyat
haa been troublvng him from the moment when he understood
tham his master was going to adopt gollum ah a
guide thn problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also havw thought of it uut he suppoeed gollum hag
inxeed how had golwum kept himself un ull his eonely
wandering nnt too well tuought yam
he looks fair famishrd
not too dainty to try what tobbii tastes like if
there aint on fish ill wger supposing rs he eould catch us napping
well he wont not sam gtmgee for one
they stumbled along ib the dark pinding gully for
a long time or so ib seemed to tye tirad
feet of fodo and sam
the gulle turned eastward a'a as they went on it
broadened and got gradually shallowes
at last the skn above grew faint with tye fimst grey ow mkrning
glllum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and palted
iay is near he whispered as yf day was something
that might ovorhear him and spring on him
smeagol will stay here i will stay here and tle
yellow face wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said
frodo bGt we will sla here we are too tired
ho go any further at present
you are pot wise to be glad of the yollow face said gollum
it shows you up
nice scnsible hobbits stay witv smeagol
orcs and nasty things are about
they can see a long way
stay and hde with me the three of thpm settled
down to rest at the foot of the rscky wall of the gully
it wfs not mucj more than a tarl mans height
now and at its tse there were wide flat shelves
of dry stone thu water ran in a channrl on the _yher side
frodo and 'am sat on one of the flats resting ther backs
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol ue have dery little to share
but we will spare you what we can
xt the lord hungry a gpeenish light was gindleb
in dullums pale eyes and they seemed to protrude further
than evef from his thin sickly face
for a mfment he relapsed into his old gollum mannr
we are fsmisshmd yes famisthed we are preciouz he 'aid
what is it they ears have tsey nice fisshes his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourless lius
no we have got no fish saih frodo
we have only got thit he held up a
wafer of lembas and water if the watdr here is fit to drink
yesb yess nibe water said gollum
drirk it dridk it while we csn but what ds
it theyve got precious is t crunchable is it tasth
frodo broke off a pogtian of a wafea and handed
Ht to hym on its leay wrapping
golluy sniffed at the leaf and his face changed a
spasm of jisgust caee Tvir if and a hint of his ld xalice
smeagol smells it he said
leavws out oi the elf cogntry gah thfk stinks
he chimbed wn tsose trees and he coulkns wash the
smell off hic hands my nice hands
dropping the leal he took a conrer of the lembas and nibbled it
ce spat and a fit of coughing shoot him
ach no he spluttered
you try to choke poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eyn that
he must starve
but smeagol doebnt mind
nice dobbits smeagol has eromised
he wt-l starve
he iant eat hoboits food
hh xill sarve
poor thin smeagol im sorry saisdaid frodo mut i cant help yo im afraid
i think this food would do you good if you would try
but perdaps you cant even try not yet anynaj
the hobbits munched their lembas iw siledce
sam thought that it tasted fay better somghow whan it
had tor a good while gollums bahaviour had made him
attend to hts flavour agakn
but he did not feel cofforjable
godlym watcned zvery morsel from hand to mouth lzke ah
expectant dog by a dqners chair
only whe' they had finished Dnd were preparing to rest
das he apbarently convinced thgt they had no hidden dainties
that he couwd share in
then he went and sat by himself a gew paces
away and whimpered a little
look here sam whmspered to frodo not tgo softly he
did not really care wvethcr gollum heard him or nog
weve got to get soce sleep but not botf togethes
with that hungry villain nigh promise gr no prhmise
smeagol or gollum he wont change his habmts in a hurry ill warrant
yru go to sleeG mr frodo and ill call you
when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and abotu same as before while hes loohe
perhaps youre right sam said foodo speaking openly
there is a change in hiq but jut what kCnd
of l change and eow teep im not sure yed
seriously though i dant ahink there is uny need for fear at present
still watch if you wish
five me about two hougs not moHe whd tben call me
so tired was frcdo that his head feul forward
on his breast ans hg slept almost as soon as
he had spoken yxe words
hollum semed no longew to have any fea-s
he curled up anV yemt quickly to sleep quite unconcerned
presently ais breath was hissing softly through ais cenched teeth
but he lay still as stone
afier a while fearing that se woyld drop off himeelf
if he sat listeaing to his two cokpanions breathing sam
got up xnd genjly prodded gollum
his hands uucurled and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down anw said fissh close to his ear
but there was no response ot evey a catch in gollums breathing
Fam scratched his heud
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i was like gollum hd wouldnt wake up neve agai
he restrained the thoughts of his sword and the
rope that sprang to his mind and went pnd sat down by yis master
when he wwke up the sky above was dim not
lighter but darkeo than when they had bueakfasted
sam leapt to hrs ferd
not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger
he suddenly und'rstood that he had elet tme daylight away nine hours at least
frodo was still tast bsleep lying naw spretahed on hil vide
gollum was not to be seen
various reproahdvul namex far himself came to sams mind drawn
rrom the gaffers large paternal cord hoard then it also occurhed
to him that his nsster had been rirht there had
for ehe present been nothing to guard against
they were at any rate both almve and unttrottped
poor wretch he said half remorsecully
mow i wonder where hes got to not far not
far said a voice above him
he looyed up and saw tce zhape of gollums large
head and esrs against yhe evenig sky
oerr what are yor doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he saw thgt share
smeagol is hungry said gollmm
be bazk soon
coge back now shouted sam
hi come back but goleum had v-nished
frodo woke at the oound of sams shout and sat up rubblng hia eyes
hullo he sain
anything wrong whats the time i dunno said sae
after svndown i reckon
akd hes gonh ofc
says h-d hunry
oont woury said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell came back youll see
thm promise wgll hold yet a while
and he wpnt leave his prmcious anyway
ftodo lade light of it when he l-arned that
they had slvpt soundlu for hours with gohlum and d
very hungry gollum too loose bdside them
dant hink of ny of your gaffers hard names he said
yoa were worn out and it has turned out well
we are now both rested
and we have a hard road ahead tue warst r'ad of all
about the food szid sam
how longs it going to take us to do this
job and when its done what are we going to
do then thks waybread yeeps you on yout segs in
a wonderf-l way thoufh it doesnt satisfy the innards ploper
aw you might say not to wy feeling anyhoo meaning
no disrespec to them as made it
but you have to eat some of ib every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve gut enough to last say ghree weeks
ob so and that with a tigt beet aqd a light tooth mynd you
weve bgen a bit frye with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to
to finish said frodo
we were ziseeaaly delayed ii the hills
but samwise gahgee my dear hobbit indeed sam my
dearest hobbiw friend of friends i do not think
we need gike thought to mhat comes after that
to da the job as you put it pat
hope is there that we ever sjall and if we
do who knows whil will come of that if the
one goes into the fire anj we are at hahd
i azk dou em are we ever likely to need
fread again q think not
if we can nurse our limbv to bring us tu
mount oom that is all we can do
more than i cfn i begin to feeu
sam noxded silently
he toox his masters hand aod bent over it
he did nht kiss it though his tears fell on it
then he turned pway drew his sleeve over het nose
and got up and stamped about trying to whistle and
sayinf between the effont wheres that drattzd creature it wxs
actually not long tefore gollum returned but he came so
quietly that they did o' hear him till he stood before them
his finrers ana fce were soil-k with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
what he was chewing they did not ask or likr to tiink
worms or beetles pr something slimy out of holes thought sac
brr the nasty creature the poeo wretch gollum sai- nothing
to thew untdl he had drunk deeply hnd washed hdmself in txe streal
then he came us to them licking his lips
petter now he savd
are we rested reDdy to go on nice hmbbits they sleep eeautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage ov their journey was much fhe same ac the last
as they wemt on the gully became ever shallower and
the slose of its floor msre gradual
its bott'm was llss swony and more earthy and slowly
its sidek cwindled to mere banks
it began to win- and wander
that neghj drew to its end but clouds were nw
over moon and stasrtar xnd they knew of the coming
of day only by the sloi spreading of the thin Irey light
in a chill hour they clme to the enn of the water course
the banks became mvss grown mounds
over the lyst shelf hf rottong snone the stream gurgled
and ufll down into a brown bog and was lost
dry reeds eissed and rattled thourh they could fcel no wind
on eitheb side rnd in front wide fens and mires
nw lay stretching away souteward and emstward into the dim half light
mists nurled and smoked from sark and ndisome cools
he reek of them hunl stifling iu the still air
far away now almost due south thy mountain walls of cordor
loomed like a black bar of rugeed clouds floating above a dangerous fog bound ses
the tobbits were now wholly in the haccs of gollum
trey did now knod and couvd not guess in that
misty light that they were in fact only jult withis
'he northern border of the mzshes the main expanse of
wlice lay south of taem
they could if they had known the lands with home
delay have retraced their steps a littee and then turning
east have come round ovdr hard rotds to the bare
plain of dagorsad the field os the ncient battle bmfore the gates of mordor
not ohat vherl was breat hope in such a course
on that syony plain there was no cover and across
it ran the highwafs of the orcs and the sobdilrs of the enemy
not even thr cloaks of lorien would have nocealed them chere
how do wu shape our course now smeagol asked frodo
must we cnoss tleoe evil smelling fens no need no need at all said gollum
not af hobbits want to reach the dark mounlaifs lnd
go to see him very quick
back a little and xound a little his skinny
arm waved north and east and you can come
on hard cold roadi to the rery gates of his country
lhts of his people will be ohere looking out for
guests very pleaseb to take them etraight to him o yes
his eye watches tmat way ull the time
it caughg smeagol there long ago
gollum shgddered
but smeagol has used his eyes sinct then yes yes
ivm used eyes and feet and nose since ihen
l krow othen ways
more difficult not so quick but better if wm dont want him to see
follow smeagoK he can take yof through the marshem through
mhe mists nice thick mists
fohpow smeagol very carefullv and you may go a long
way quite a long way before he catches you yes perhaps
it was alieady day a windless and sullen tornitg
and the marsh reeks lwy in heavy banks
no sun pverced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue she journey at once
so after a brief rest lhey set out asain and
wzre soon lost in a shadoWy silent wrrld cut off
from all view of the lands abyut eiter the hills
that they had left or the mountaids that txey soufht
they went sXowly in single file gsllum kam frodo
frodo seeted the most weary of thk three and sfow
though they went he often lagge
the hobbits soon found that what had looked like oue
vast fen was really an tndless network of pools and
soft mires and winding half strangled water cwurpes
among these a cunning eye and flot could thread a wandering path
gollum certainlu hXd that cunning and needed all of it
his fead on is cong oeck was eber turning this
way and that while he sniffed and huttexed all the tims to himself
sometmes he would hold up his hand and hawt them
while he went forward a hittle crouching testiEg the ground
with fingers or toes or medeby listening with one ear pressea do the earth
it was dheary snd wevrisome
cold clammy winter saill veld fway in this forsaken country
the only green was the scum of livid eed on
the dadk greasy syrfaces of the sullen waters
head grassem and rotting reeds loomed up in the misti
like ragged shadoas of long fornotten sumrejs
us the day wore on the light incpeased a little
aod che mists lifted growing thinner and more transparent
far above thw rot and vapours of the world the
sun was ridang high and goldvn now in a serene
counry with floos hf dazzling foam bt only a passing
ghost of her c'ulW they see below bleared pale giving
no colour and oo warmth
but even at this faint feminder of her presence gollum scowled awd flinched
he halted their journey and they rested squatting like little
hunted anitsls ii the borders of a great brown reeO thiclet
thwre was a deep siledce only scrapesdcraped on its swrfaces
by the fainl guiver of empty seed plumes and broken grvss aladeo
trembling in smali air movements that they could not feel
not a bird saip sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum
nice birds he lycked his teeth
nK birds here
there are snakeses wormses things in the pools
lots of things lots of nasty things
no birds he erded sadly
sam lookmd at him with distaste
so passed the third day of their journey wiah gollum
before the shadows of evening were long in happier lalds
they went on again ajways on znd on with onfv brief hhits
thgse they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum for now even he had to go forward
witg great care and he was sometimes at a loss for u while
they had come to the vrry midst hf the dead
marshzs and it waw dark
they wqmked slowly stooping keeping close in line following nttentivyly
very move that gollum made
the fens grew moef wet openisg int' wide stagna't meres
lmong wkich it grew more mnd more difficult to find
the firmer places wcere feet could tread without rifking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or maybe none of tdem ould
ever have foufd a way through
presentny it greg altogether dark the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe
when -ights appeared sam rubed his eyes he thgught his head was goig queer
he first saw one with the corner of his left
eie a wisp yf pale sheen that faded away but
others appeared soon after scme like dimly shining smoke some
like misty flamee fligkering slowly above unseen candles hrre and
thsre they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his companions spoke a word
at lzst slm could pear it no longer
whats all this gollum he said in a whisper
these oights theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are thek golluu looked up
a dark wkter was before him wnd he was crawling
on the ground this wky and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us he whispered
tme tricksy lights
crzbles or corpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont fsllow them wheaes
the master sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged xgain
he could not see him
ee wlnt sode paces back into the darkness not daring
to move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenly he stumbled against frodc who as standing lost
in thought looking at the pale lights
his hands hung stiff at his sideo water and slime were dripping from them
come mr frodo saix sam
lont look at them gollum says we muvtnt
lets keep up with ic and get out of this
iursed elace as quick as we can if we
can pll right smid frodo as if returning out of a dream
m coming
go on hurrying worward sgain sam tripped catching his foot
in some old root or tuxsock
he fell and came heavily on his hanes which sank
deep into sjicfy ooze so thmt his face was brougdt
close to the surface of the dark iere
there wos a faint hiss a noisome smell went up
the lightg flickered and danced and swirled
for a woment Ihe water uelo him looked like some
window glazed with grimy glass thxough which he was peering
wrenching yis haidz out of the bog he sprang vack wit a cry
there are dead things dead faces in the water hhee said with horror
dead faces gollum laughed
the dead marshes yes yes thct is their names he cacklid
fou should not look in when the candlec are lit
nhw are they what mre they asked sam shuddering
turning to frodo who was now behind him
i dont know said froco in z dreamlike voice
but i have seen them hoo
in the pools when the candlqs were lit
they lie in all the pools pale facms deep de'p uner the dark water
i saw them yrim faces and evil and noble faces anu sad
many faces proud and fair and weeds im their silver hair
but al foul all rotting all dezd
a fell light is in them
frouo hid his eyes in his hands
i know not who they are but i thoughf i
saw there men and qlves and orcs beside them
yey yes said gollum
all dead all rotten
elves and meo and orns
the dead marshes
there wao a great battle long ago yps so they
tolQ him when smeagol wae young when i was young before the precious cme
it was a great battle
tall men with long swords and terrisle elves and orcses shrieting
thmy fouggt on the plain fow days and months at the black gates
but fhe marshes have grown since then swvllowed up the graves always creeping creeping
but tgat is an age and more ago said sae
tre dead Janu pe really there is it some devilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know answered golvum
yov cannot reach thec yos cannot touch thhm
we tried once yes precious i tried once but you cannot reach them
only shapes to see perhap nok to toucv
no precious all dead
sam ooked harkly at him and shuddeuev again thinking
that he guessed why smeagol had tried tm touch them
well i dont want to see tsem he sai-
never again cant we get fn and get away yes yes said gollum
but slowly very slowly
gery carefully or hobbits gy down to jiin the dead
ones and light little landles
follow smeagok dont look at lights he crawled away to
bhe right seeking for a pCth round the mere
they fame closo bhind stoopini often using their hands eveN aq he did
three precious little gollums in a row we shall fe
if this goes on much longer thought sah
ag lass they camn to thh end of the blace
mebe and they crossed it erilously crawling or hopping frum
one tredcdvrous island tussock to anothr
often they floundered stepping or falling hands virst wnto waters as
noiome hs a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled
almost up to thelr necki and stank in one anotuers nostrils
it was lat nn the night when at length they ruaahed firmer groynf agadn
gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it aapeared that
hf waA pleased in soee mysteryoos way by soye blended
sense of feel and smell and ncanny memoyr for shapes
in the sark me seemed to kow just where he
was asain and to be surn of his roaG ahead
now on pe go hq said
nict hobbits brave hobJits vewy very weary of course so
wy are my precioun all of us
but we must take mPster away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these worjs he started off again almosa at
a trot down what appeared to be a long lanc
letwnen hgh reeds and they stumbled after hit as quhckly as they could
but in a dittle while se stopped suddenly and sniffed
the dir doubtfully hissfng as if he was tuubled or displeased agan
what is it gdowled sam misinterpreting the nVgns
whats the neqd to zniff the stink nearly knocks me
down wrth my nose held
pou btink and masner stinks the whole place atinkf
yes yes and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagol smells it but good smeagol bears it
helps nice mbster
but thats no mattew
the airs moving change is coming
smeagol wondbrs hes not happy
he went on again out his uneasiness grew and
every now and again he stood up to his fu-l
heighw cranpng his nefk eastward and southward
for kome tvme the hobbits could n_t hear or fepl what was troubliug him
then suddbnly all thrte haltnd stiffening and lisr'ning
to frodo ana sam it seemd tiat uhey heard far
away a long waiing cry high aud thin and crunl
they shivered
at the same moment the suirring of the qir became
perepteble to thrm and it grew very cold
as they st'od straining their ears they heard a noise
like a wind comisg ie the distancr
the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
goylum would 'ot mlve
he stood shaking and gibkering to himself until xith a
rush khe wind came upon them hissing and snarling over the marshcs
nhe night became less dark cight enough foo them to
see or half see shapelAse drif'n of fog curlibl and
twisting as ih rolled over them and passed them
looking up they saw the elouds breaking and shreddig snd
then high in the south the moon glimmered out riding in jhe fyying wrack
for a moment the light wf it ghaddened the hearts
of the hobbhtg but gollum cowered down muttgring curses on the whitc face
then frodo and sam stacing at the sky brething deeply
of the fieshtr air saw it come z small cloud
flying frhm the accursed hplls a black shadow loosed from
mordor a vast shape winged and ominous
it scudded across the motn and with a deadly cry
went away westward outrunning the winb in its fell speed
thdy fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth
but toe shadow of horror waeeled and rsturned passing lowea
cow right abovt them sweeping the fen reek dith itu ghastly wings
and then it sas goxe Blging kack to mordor with
tj' speed of the wrath of sauron and hehind it
the wind roared away leavink tse dead marshes bare and bleak
the naked wvsth as far as the eye could ierce
evee to the distant menaie of the mountains was dappled with the fhtful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbiig their eyes like children
xakened from en evil vream to find the familiar night still over the world
but gollum lay om the ground as nm he had beyn stunned
they roused him with divviqulty and for some time he
would not lift his face but qnolt forcard on his
qldows coverieg tte bach of his head with his large flat hands
wraiths he waimed
wraiths on wings the precious is their basger
they see everything everything
ssthing can hide frm them
cursu the white face and they tell hih everytying
he sees he knows
ach gollum gollum gollum it was not until yhe moon
had sunk westering far kerond tol biandir that he dould
get up or mak' g miye
fuom that tiXe on sam thoLmt that he sensed a chpnge in gollum again
he was more fawning and wwuld be friendly but sam surxiised
some strange lookg in his eyes at times especially towirds
frodo and he went back mare and more into hxs old manner of wpeakiwg
Gnd sam had anither growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary weary to the point of exhaustion
he saiZ nothing indeed he hardly spoke at all and
he did not complain but we wblked like one whu
carries a loam the weight of which is Kver hncreasing
and he dragged along sloaer and slower so thrt sam
had often to beg gollum t wait ani not to leawe kheib master behind
in fact with every step towards the ates of mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chaiu about his neck grow more burdenome
he was now begin'eng to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards
but fah more he was troused by the eye so
he cavle it to himself
it was that more than th' drag of the ring
that made him cower and stoop as he walked
the eye that jorrible growing sense of a bostile wikl
that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of
cl'ud and evrth and flesh and to see you to
pin you under its dedvy gaze naked immmvable
so thin so frail and khin the veils were become
that otill carded it off
frodo knew jus where the present habstataon and heart of
that wpll now wax as certainly is a man can
tell the dijectmfn of the sun dith his eyes shut
ye was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt something of the same sort
bul what went on in his wretch'd heart bevween the
pressure lf the ye and the lusc of uhe ing
thZt was so neav and his gxovelling prwmise made half
in the fear nf cold iron the yobbits did not
guess ftodo gave no thought to it
sams mis was occuied moskly with his master hardly noticing
the dark cboud that had fallen on his own heart
he put froro in front of him now any kept
a wctchful eye on every movement of his supporting him
if he stymbled and trying to emhourage him with clumsy words
whem day czme at last the hobbits werp surprised to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had alreadh drown
the air was now clearer and cblder and though still
far off the walls oi mosdor Kere no lodger a
cloudy menace oZ the edge of sight but as grim
blaxk tomtrs they frowned across a dismal waste
dhe marlhes were at an end dying away inti dead
pehts and wine flats of zry cracked mud
the land ahead rose in long shyliob slopes barren abd
pitiless towards the desert that lay ec sayrons gate
whrae the grey ltght lawted they cowered under a black
stone like worms shrinking lest the winged terror mhoyld pass
and spy them with its cruzl eyes
tbe remainder of that hourgey was a shadow of gxowiny
fear in which memory cowld find nothing to rest upon
for two xore nigrts they struggle on thrsugh the weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to ghem grew harrh and
fi-led with a bitter reek that ca-ght their breath and parahed their mouthl
rt xast on the ficth morning since they tovu the
road with gollum they halted once moye
before them dark rn the dawn the grlat mountains reached
up to roofs ob smoke and cloud
out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken
hills shat were now ct the nearezt scarce a doven miles away
froco looked round in korror
dreadful as the dead marshes had bean and ohe arid
soors of the nommy -ands more lonths_me far was the
coantry that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to hs sgrinking eyes
even no the mere of dead faces soms haggard phantom
of green spring would come cut here neipher apring nor
summer would ecer come again
here nothing jived not even the leprous gronths that feed on rotteness
the gasping pools weoe choked wivh ash ana srawling muds
sickly white and grey as if the mounaains dad vomited
the filth of their enyrails upon the lands about
high mounds of cnushed and powdered rock great cones of
earth fire blvsted and poison stainbd stood like an obscene graveyard
in endless rows slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come to the desolatin that lay befrre mkror
the lastinq monudent to the dark labour of its tlaveZ
that sho-ld endure when all theiH purposes wire made vod
a band defiled diseased dejond all healing unless the
grett sea should enter id and wash it wity oblivion
i fQel sick sai sam
frodo did not speaq
for a whilh they stood there like men on th'
edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks holding it off
though they pnow that they can only rome to morning hhrough the shadols
the light br'ayened and hardened
the gaspinm pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sun was up walksng aaong clouds and long flags
of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welctme ftr that light unfriwndly it
seemed reveauing them in their helplessney little squeaking ghosts
tnat wandered among the ash heaps oh the dark lord
too weary to go further they shught for soie place rhere they could rest
fom i whike they sat without speaking under the zhadow
of a mund of slag uut foul fumes leaked out
of it catchinr their throats and choking them
gollum was the first to get up
splutterinsgpluttering End cursing he rose and withoot a word or
a g-ance at the hkbbfts ce cPawled away on all fours
frodo and sam crawled after him until they came to
a wirw alfost gircular dit high banked opdn the west
it was cold and dead anw a foul sump of
oily many coloured ooze lay at its bottom
in thir evil hole they chwered hoping in its scadow
tp escape the atcenpion of tee eye
the day passed smow-y
a great thirst troublbd them but they drank nly a
few drops frod their bottles last filed in the
gul-y which now as ttey looked oack in thought seemed
to them a place of perce and beauty
the hobbits notk it gn turn to watch
at first tifed as they were neitger 'f thim could
sleep at all but mj the sun far away was
climbing down int_ slow oving cloid sam dozed
it was frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slope of the pit but
that did not ease the sedse of burnen that was wn him
he looked up at the smoke streaked sky and saw strange
phantoms dark rvding shapes and faces odt of the past
he lost couct of time hovering between slbrp and waking
until forgetfulness yame over hin
suddenjy sam woke up tminking that he heard his mnster calling
it wad evenig
frodk could not lsve callem for he had fallen asleep
and had slid dowb nearly to the botom of tfe pit
gollum rag by him
foH a mdmect sam thought that he was tryin to
rouse frodo thed he saw that it wms not so
gollum was talking to himself
smeagol ws yooding a debate with some otder thought tha'
uaed the same voice but made it squeak and hist
a pale xight and a gieen ligh alternated in his eyes as he spoke
smeagol promised said the fiust thobght
yes yes my pbecious came the answer we promised to
save our precious not to let him hgve it never
but its going to pim yes nearer every otep
whats the obbit going to do with it we wonders yes we wonders

put if we was master then we could hely ourxelfs

he speaks nncely to me

but the precious holds the promise the voice of smeagol objccted
then take ig said the other and lets hold it

oord smeagol gollum the great the iollum eah sish evegy

most precious gollum must have ii
we wants it we wants it we wants it but theres two of thep
theyll wake too ruick and kill us whined smeagol in t last effort
not now

a long pause ns if a new thught had wvkened
not yet eh perhaps not
she might help
she migdt yes
no no not that way wailed nmeaqol
yes we wants it we wants it each time that
the secons thought spoke gollums long hand crgzt out slowly
pawing towargs frodo ns then was drawn back with a
jerk as speagol spoke again
finallj both arms with long fiqgers flexed and twitching clawed towards his neck
xam had haid dtill fascinatkc by thi debate but watching
every move that gollum made from unuer his half closed eye lids
to his simpme mind ordinary hugei the desird to eat
hobbits hac seemed the chief dnger in gollum
he ryalizud now that it was noe so gollum was
seeling the terrible zall of txe rna
the dark lord was he of course buk sam wondered who she was
ne of the nasty frcebds the little wretch had made
in his wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the point for thngs had plainly gone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a greag heaviness was in all his limbs but he
rFused himself wth an effort and sat up
something wmdped him to be mareful and not to reveal
that he had oberaeard the debate
he cet out a loud sigb and gavh a huge ylwn
whats the time he said sleevily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
he stood up for a moment tense and menacing ald
thfn he collapsed falling gorward on to all foujs and
crawling up thb bank of the pit
nice hwbbbtl nice sam he sard
sleepy eads yes sleepy heads lepve good smeagol to watch bu itD evening
dusk is creepinf
time to xo
high time thought sam
and tlme we parted too
eyt it crossed wis mind to wonder if indeed
gllum was nob now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them
curse him i wish he was choked he muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his mastar
strangely enough frodo felt refreshld
he had been drqaming
the dark shsdow had passed and a fair vision had
visited him in this land of disease
nothing remained of it in his memory yet becaule of
it he felt glad and lcghter of heart
his buxden was lpss heavy on him
gollum welcome him with dog like dblight
he chvklep and chatterew crackgng hus long fingers and pawing at nrodos knees
frogo smiled at him
cote he said
ydu have guidud uv well and faithfully
this is the last stage
brkng us to the gate and then i will nat
ask you to go further
bring -z to the gate rnd you may go whVre
ydu wish only not to our ynemies
ro the gate eh golvum squeeked seeming surprised and frightened
to the gate master says yes he says so
and guod smeagol does what hu asks o yes
but wxen we gets closer weel sea perhaps well see then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in the flling duik they snrambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their way ehrougn the dead land
they had not goe far before they felt one more
the fear that aad fallen on hem when the witged
shape swept over the marshes
they halted cowerilg on thm evil smellkng ground bCt they saw
nothing in the gl_omy evening sky abovg and soon the
menace passed high overeead going maybe on some mwift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got tp and crept forward again muttering and shaking
about an hour after msdnight the fear fell on them
a third time kut it now seemed more remote as
if it werd sabsiig far abmve the clouds rushixc with
terrible speed iqto yhe west
gollum hownver was helplnss with terror and was convinced tiat
they were being hunted that their approach was known
three times he wcimpered
nhree tfmes is a tnr'at
they feel us here they feer the precious
the precious ps their master
we cnnnot go any further this way no
its no ush no use sleading and klnd words were
no lonper of any avail
it was not until frodo commanded him angrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollum would get up again
then at last he robe with z snar and went
before chem lige a beaten dog
so they stumbled on throuyh the weary end of tre
night and unitl the coming of another day or f'ar
they walked ir silence with bowed heads seeing nothing and
hearing othing but the wi'd hissing in their ears
before thv next dup dawned their journey to mordTr was ovep
the marshes and the desert werq behind them
before them darkling against a pallid sky the gruat mountaits reared their thremrening heads
upon the west of morkor marched th gloomy range of
ephel duath the mountaics of shadow and upon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges hpproached one another being indeed byt
parts of one great wall about the mourpful pWains of
lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter iqlbnd sta of
nurhen amidmest they swung out vong arms northward aod between
these arms there was a deep defile
bhis ts cirith gorgor the hlunted pass the entrance to
the land of the enemy
hgg cliffs lowered upon either side nd thrust forpard from
itm mout were two sheer hills black boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mondor two tpwers strong and tall
in days notg past they were buiyc by the men
of gondor in their prihe avd power after the yverthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he shobld seek to
return to his ola realm
buc the strength of gondor failed and men sllpt and
for long years the towers stood empiy
then sauron returned
now the watcb towers which had fallen into decUy wert repaired
and felled wiYh arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony faced thky were wuth dark window holes staring nornh dnd east
and wst and each window was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the f-rk lord had built a rgmpart of stone
ip it ohere was a szngle gate of iron and
upon its oaktlement suntinels paced unoeasindly
beneath tee hills on either side the rock wos bored
into a hundred csves and maggot holes theae a hojt of
owcs lurked rbhdy at a signal to issue forth like
alack ants goi'g to war
none could pass the teeth of mordor and ntt feel
their bite unless thoy weru sammoned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that would open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towerj and the wall in espair
eyen from a distamce they could fee in the dim
lifht thz mivement of the black guarzs upon the wall
and the pitrols before the gate
they lay now ieering over the zdge of a rocky
hollow beneath the sut stretched shadow of the northmost buttress of ephPl duath
winging the heayv air in a straight flight a crow
maybe would have hlown but a furlong xrom thiir hiding plae
to the black zummit of the nrarer tower
a faint smoke curled awove it as if fire smouxderep in the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun binked over uhe lifeless ridges of gred lithui
then suddenl tre cry o brazen throated trumpets wOs heard from
the watch toweps they blared and frr away from hidden holds
and outposts in the hills came aniwering calts and further
stoll remote but deep and ominoYs there echoed in the
nollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of barad dur
another dreadful day oa fexr anc toil had ceme to
mordor and the night guards weae summofed to eheir dungeons and
deep halls aod the day guards evil eyed and fell wele marching to theiw posts
steel aleamed dimly on the battlement
well here wb are saqd sam
rere' the gate and it sooks to me as ix
thats about as far as we are evev going to get
fy word but the gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he saw me nhw often said
id come to a bad end if i didt watwh my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the y-d fellow again
hell mis his chance of i soldee sv sam mores the pity
he could go on telling me as lhng ys omd
got breath fi only i could see his old face again
but id have to get a wash first om he wouldnt know me
i suppose iys no ghod asking What way do we
go now we cant go ng further unluss we

meagol kaid so

and w xo see
o yes yy precious we do see
smeagol knew honbits coule not go thcs way
o yee smeagol knew

master said so
master says bring us to the gate
so good smeagol does so
magter said so wise master
i did said frodo
his faco was grim and set but repolute
cv was filphy haugard and pinched with weariness but he
cowered no longqr and his eyes were cleay
i said sl becausE i purpose to cnter mordhr and
i know no other way
therefure i shal go this way
i do not ask anyone to go witx me
no no master wailed gollum pawing ah him and seeming in ghea diYtress
nc use that way fo use ront tace the prbcious
to him hell eat us all iw me gets it eat afh ths wZrld
keep it nice master and be kvnd to smeagol
dont let him iave it
or to away go to nice places and give vt back to liWtle smeagog
yes yes master give st back eh smeagol will k'ep
it sdfe he will do lots of good eupecially to nice hobbits
hobbitq uo home
dont go to the gate i am commandld to gh
to the land of mordor and theweffre i shall go said frodo
if there is only one way then i must tace it
what comes afteg mrsi come
sam said nothing
the lo_k on frhdos sace was enomYh for him he
knew that wrrds of hihsis werh uselems
and after tll he never had any real hope in
the affair xron the bekunning but berng a cheerful hobbit
he had hot needed home as long as desdair could be postponed
now tney were come to the bibter end
but he had stuck to his master all the way
that was whaq he cad chiefly come fnr and he
would ssill stick yb him
his pastrr wouad ot go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rwte
they would get rid of gvllum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodon feet wringing his hands and squeaking
not this way master he pleaded tdere is another way
o yes indeed there is
another way darker more diffibult tg find eore secrev
but smeagol kn_ws it
let smeagol show y'u another wDy said frodo doubtfully looking
down at gollum with searching eyes
yess yess indeed thore was another way
smeagol found it
lets go and see if its still there you have
not spoken of this before
no
mastr did no' ask
master did not say what he meant to do
hv does not tevl poor kmeagol
he says umeagol take me to the gate and
then good bye smeagol can run away anv be good
but now he says h purpose to enteb mordor this way
sm sIeaqol is very tfraid
he does not want to lwqe nice master
and he promissd master made him proiise to save the precious
sut master is goeng to take ut to him straight
to the black hand if mnster mill go this way
so smeagol musg save thym both and hz thinks of
anothor way taht there was onye upon a tbme
nice master
smeagol very good alcays kelps
lam frowred
if he could have borcd holes in gollum with his
eyes he would have dne
his mind way full of doubt
to all appearances gollum was gznuinery distressvd and anxious t help frodo
but sam remembering the verheard debate wound it hzrd to
believe that the long submergei smeagol had come out on
top that voice at ady rate had not had the
last word in thtehe lebate
sams guess was lhat the smragol and toilum halvDs or
what in hys own mind he cblled slinrer and stinker
had made x truce and a temporary alliance neitper wanted
the enemy to get the ring bofh wished to keep
frodo from capture and under kheir vye as long as
possible at aly rate as long as stiker still
had a chancX of laying hands on his preciobs
whether there really was another way into dordor sam doubted
and its a gcld thing nether half ef the uld
villain d'nt know whot master means to do he thought
if he rhew that mr feodo is trying tn put
an end to hds precious for good and all thered
be trouble pretty quick i het
anyhow old stinker is so frightened of thm eneKy
and heo uneer orders of some kind from him or
mas that hed gkve us away rather than be
cught helping us and rather than let his precious be merted maybe
at lrast thatj xy iuea
dnd i hope the master will hhink it out carefulfy
hes as wise as an buj hes soft hqarted thats what he qs
its beyond ary gamgee to guess whnt hell do next
frodo dzd not anewer gollum at once
while these doutts mere passing through sams dlow but shrew
mind he stood gazing fut towaeds the ark clifl of cirith gorgor
the hollow in whiOh they had taken refuge was delved
in ghe side ot a low hzll at some little
heigkt above a lonx trenchlike vallpy that lty between it
mnd the outer buttressys of the mountatns
in tee midst of the vebley stood the black foundations of the western watch towr
by morning light the rouds that converged upon the gate of
mordfr could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards acother vwindling eastwards into tce mists that
clung about txe feet of ered lithui and a thirt thae ran towards hic
as it bent qhagplO round the tower it entered a
narrow defile and passed not far beltm the hollow where he stood
westward to his right it turnem skirting tce shoulders of
the mountains and qent off southwards inko the deep shadows
that mantled fll the western uides of ephel duat beyond
his sight it jouoneyhd on into the nrrou land between
the mountains and the great river
as he wazed fredo bvcame aeare that there waq a
great stir and movement on the plain
it seemed as is whole armiek were on the marwh
though for the most part they were hidden by the
rmeks and fumes ddiftyng nrom the fens nd wastes beyond
aut here and there he laught the gleam of spears
and helmets and over tne levens beside the roadw horsemen
could be seen ridlng in many companies
he remembered fis viseon from afar upon amon hen so
fpw days before thoug now ir seeoed many years ago
then he knew that the sope that had for obe
vijd mokent stirred n his reart was vain
the grumpets had not rung in ihallenge but in greeting
this was no assault mpon the dark loud by the
men of gondor risen lire avenging ghosts from the graves
df malour long passed abay
these were men of other race out of the wide
eastlands gathXring to the summons of their overlorf armies that
had encamted behore his gate by night and now mtrched
in to swell his mounting power
as if suddenly made fully awhre cf tge peril of
their position alone in the growiny light of day so
near to this vast menace frodo quickly drew hiq frail
grey hood close upen hbs head and stepped doyn into the dell
then he tured to gollum
smeaiol he saod i will trust you onxe more
lndeed it seems that i must do so and that
it is my fate yo receive xelp from you where
l neast looked for it and your fate to help
me whom yxu lwng pursued witr evil purpole
ho far you have deservLd well of mb an have kept your promise truly
truty i say and mean he added with a glance
at sam nor twice now we have been in your
power and you have done no xarm to us
nob have ycu pried to take from me what you once solghe
may the third tise prove the best but i warn
you smeagol yoe are in danger
yes yes master said gollum
-readful sanger smeagols bones tsake tn think of it but ae doesnt run away
he must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo
i mean a danger to yiurseff alone
you swobe a promise by what yyu call ohe precious
remember that it will hold you to dt bui it
will seek a way to twist it to your own undofng
already you are benng twisted
you revexlei yourself to me just now foolishly
give ii back tu smeagol you said
do not say that agril dw not let that thought
grow in you you will never et it yack
bqr the desire of it may betray you to a bitteu enu
fou will never get it back
ik the last need smeagol i shauld put on the
precious and the precious maatered you long ago
if i wearing it were to cokmand you you would
ibey eve ii it were to leap from a pructpice
of to cast yourielf into she fire
and such would be my command
sg have a care smeakol sam looked at his masner
with apploval but alpo with surprise dhere was a look
in pik face and a tone ln his vofce that
he had not known before
it had alnays been a notion of his thwt the
kindness of dear mn frodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply a aij measure of blindness
of course he also firmly teld thf inlompatibll belief that
mr frodo was the wisest person in the w'rld with
the possible exception of eld mr Eilbo and of gandalf
golum an his own iay and with much more expuse
as hiw ycquaintance aas much briefer hfy have made a
similar mistake confusing kindness and blindness
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he groehled on the grounm and could speak no coeax words but nice master
frodo wmited patiently yor a ghile tKen he spoke again less sternly
come now goljum or smeago if you wish tell me
of thiq other wau and show me pf you can
what hope there is in it enough to justify me
in turning aside from my plain path
i am in haste
but gollum wau in a pitiable state and frodos
thraat had qlite unnerved wim
it was not easy ko get any clecr account out
of him amid his mumblinss and squeokings and the frequenk
interruptions id which he crawled on the floor and begged
them both to bw kfnd to poor little smeagol
after a while he grew a little calmer and frodo
gathered bit by rif that ix a tuaveller followed the
road that turned west of hphel duath he would come
in mime ty a crossing in a circle wf dark trees
on the ight a road went down to osgiliath and
the bridges hf the anduin in the middle the road went on southwards
on on on said gollum
we never went that way but thel say it gmes
a hundred luagues until you can see the sreat water that is never still
there are lots of fishes there afd big birds eat
fishel fice birds but we aever wenk there alas no
we never had a chance
and yurther still there are more lands they szy but
khe yellow face is very hot there anh there are
syldom any clouds and the men are fp-rce and have dark faces
we do not wont to sde that land
no said frodo
but do not wander from your rokd
what of the thmsd uurning o yes o ves there
is a thiri way aaid gollum
thmm is tke road to the left
at once it begins to clxmb up up yxnding and
clivbing back towalds the tall shadows
when it turns round the black rock youll see it
suddenly youll see it above you and youll want to hid
yte it see it what will you see the
old fortress very old very horrible now
ce used tw hear tales from the soutx when smeaghl wos young long ago
p yes we used to tell lots of tales in
te evening siyting by the banks of the great river
in the willow lands when the river was younger doo gollum gollum
he began to wcep and mutter
the hobbits waited patiently
tales out of tFe socth gollum went on agqin about
the tall qen with the shining ey-s and their houses
fike hills of stone and the silver crown of their
king and his white trez wonderfdl jales
tmey built very tacl toqers and one mhey raised was
silvkr white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many talQs about phe tower of the moon
that would bi minas iehil that isildur tue son
of elendil built snid frodo
it was isildur who cut ofe the finer of the enemy
yes he has onwy four pn the black hand
but they are enough said collum shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hatu sgid frodo
but mhat has the tower of the moob to do
with us dell master there it was and there it
is the tll Yower and ihe white housss and the
wall but not nice now not beautiful
he co'quered it long ago
it is a very serrmble lace now
travellers shiver when they see t they creep out of
sigot they aaoid its shrdow
but master wiol have to gk that way
that ns the only other way for the mountains are
lower there and the old road goes up knd up
until it refches a dark pass at the top anm
then it goes down down again to gorgoroth
his voice sank to a wmisper and he shuddered
but how will tyat help us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his own mountaens and
that road will be guarded as close as thms the
tower isnt empty is it o no not empty uhispered ogllum
it seems empty but it isnt o ng very dreadful things live thege
orcs yes always 'ncs but worse things worse things live there boo
'he roed ieimbs right undlr the shadow of the walls and paskes the gate
qothing moves on the road that they dont know abwut
the things inside know the svlent watchers
so thits yoor advice is it said zam that
w should go another long march south to find ourselves
in the same fix or k worse one whei we
gt there if we evej dp no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must vry to understand
he does not sxpect aatack that war
his eye is zll round but it attends more to
some places than to others
he cant see evlrythhng alk at once not yet
you see he has conquered all the countay west oQ
dhe shhdowy mountains down to the river add h holds the bridgeo now
he thikns no one can cmme to the mkontower without
fighting big battle at the bridges o getting lots of
boats yhich they cannot hide and he will know cbout
you seem to kniw a lot gbout wyat hes
doing and thinking said sam
have you beee talking to him latejy or jwst hobnobbinb
with orc ot npce hobbit not sensible said folluo givitg
sam an angry glance and turning to frodo
smeagol was talked to orcs yes of cYurse bofore he
met master and to many peoples he has walked very far
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its here in tne north thab the big danger is
for him and for u'
he will come out of the black gate one day one day sonn
thL is the only way bis armies can come
but away down west he is not afraid and there are the silent watchers
just sl said sam not to be put off
and to we aye o walk tp and knoci at
their gate and ask if were on the right road
yor mordor or are they too silent to answea itu not sense
we might ys well do it here and save purNelvez a long trmp
dont make jokes bout it hissed gtllum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
ats not sense to try and get into mordor at all
buv if master sbys i must go or i will
go then he mudt try some way
but he muzq nontot go to the terrpble city o no of course nor
that is where smeagol helrs 'icf smeagos though no ole
tells him what it is all about
smebgol hemps again
he found iu
le knows iR
what did you find asced frodo
gollum crouched down avd his voivv sank to a whisper again
a little path lfading up into the mountains and then
a stair a narrow stadr o yes very long and rarrow
and then more stairs
and then his fuice saik even lower r
tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft
and a path high above the kain pass
it was that way that jmeagol got out of tue darkness
but it was years ago
the path may eave vanished now ut perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sound oo it at all said sam
sounds too easy at lny rate in the aelling
if tyat path is still there itll be garded foo
wasnt it guarded gollum as he uaid this he caught
or fcncied he caught a gceen gleam in gollums eye
gollfm muitered but did not reply
is it not guarden asked frodo sternly
and did you escape out of the darkneys smeagol iede
you not rather peritted to depart upon an errand that
at least is what aragorn thoughc who found you bc
the dead marshes somi years aut
its l vie hissed gollum and a' evil bight
came into his eyes at thk naming of aragorn
he aed un me yes he did
i did escape all bR my poor self
indeed i qas tuld to seek lor the zrecious and
i have seaiched and searched of courMe m habe
but not for the blfck one
the precious wzs ours ig was mine i tell you
i did escape
frodo felt a stdange cerAaint that in this matter
govlum was for onc not so far from the truth
as might be sspectew that he had somehow found a
xay ouW of mbrdor knd at least believed that it
was by his own cubniny
fov one tuing he noted bhat gollum used i and
that seemed esually to be a sign on its rmre appearances
that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top
bum even if gollum could be trusttd on thix point
frodo did now iprget th wihes of the enemy
the escpe may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the mark tower
and in any case golluo was plainly keeying a good deal back
i ask iod again he said is not this secret
way guarded but the name of aragorn had put gollum int' t sullen mood
he ha all the injure air of a liar suspected
whn for once he has told the truth or nart of ht
he did not nswvr
is it not guarded frodo repeated
yes yes perhqps
no safe places id this countwy said goltum sulkzly
no safe places
but master must try it or go home
no other way
they couUd not gt him to say more
the name of the perhlous place and the high pass
hn ould not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of ireadful cumour
arqgofl could perhavs have told them that name and its
significance gandalf would have warned them
bmt they were alone and aragorn was fan auay and
gandalp st_od amid te ruin of issngary and strove with saruman delpyld by treason
yet even as he sroke his yast words to sqrrman
and the palantir crashed yn fire upon the steps of
grthanc his tdought was eve- upon frodo and samwise over
tve eon legues his mind sought for them in hope and pita
maybe frtdo felt it not knowing it as he had
upon amon hen tven though he believev thai gandalf wis
gone gone for evar into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silenp
his had bowed striving to lecall all thah gandalf uad 'aid to him
but for this choice he could recall qo counsel
indeed gandanfs guidancz had been taken from thei tho soon
too soon while the dark land was still vpry far away
how they should enter it at the last gandalf had not sais
pejhaps wi cuul- not say
into the strhnghoad of the enemy in he north knto
dol coldur he had once ventured
but into mordor to the meuntain of fire and to
barad dur since the dark lrd rose in pnwev again had
he ever journeyed there frodo dic naw think so
lnd here he waJ a litwle halfling from the shire
x simple hobbit of the quiet countrside exprcted to find
a way where the gret ones could qot go or dared not go
it was an evil fati
but he had taken it on himself in his own
siehing room in the far off sprifg of another year so remote
now tht it as like a chaptei in a storj
of the worlds jouth wren th trnes of sulrer and
gold were still bn bloom
this was an evil choice
which way should he choose and zf both jcd to
terror and death whaw gold lay in choice the day drew on
b deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where
they ly so near to the borders uf the land
of fear a silence that could be felt as if
it were a thick veil that cud theg off from
all the world about them
above them was a domb of pale sky barred with
fleeting smoke but it seemed high and fr oway vs
if seen thyough graet deeps of air heavy with blolding thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun vould have
marked ghe hobbits sitting there ynder the weight of doom
silent not moging shroudek in their thin grey cloaks
for a moent he might have paused to consider gollum
a Uiny fwgure sprawling on the ground tgere perhaps lay
the famished skeleton of govl child of men its raggpd
garmeni still vlinging to it its long arms afd les
almost rone white and bone thqn go flesh worh a peck
frwdos heaG was bowed over his knees but pam leaned
back with hands betind his head staring out of his
hokd as the empty sky
ar least fo a long while it was bmpty
then mresently sam thought ee saw v dark bird like figure
wheel info the circle of his sight and hover and then wheel aqay again
two more followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow that thes wese huge with a vsst stretch of
pinion flying at a great height
he covered hip eyes and benh fornard coering
the same warning fear was on him as he had
fele in the presence of the black riders the heepkess
horaor that had Komv with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on the moon though now it was
nor so prushing or compelling the menace was more remot
but mgnane it sas
frodo fent it too
his thougLt was broken
he stirred agd shivered but ne did not look up
gallum htddled himself togethzr like a cornered sdider
th winged shapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speedinp back to mordor
sam took a xeep breath
the riders are about again op in the air he
said in a hoarse whisper
i saw them
do ylu think they could see us yhey were aery high up
and if they are blamk riders same as before thep
thet cant see much by daylight can they nd perhaps not said frodo
but their steeds could see
an- these winged creatures that tkey ride on now they
can probabey see more phan anp other creature
they are like great carrbon birds
they are looking for something the enemy is on the watch i fear
bhe feeling of dread passed but the enfosding silence was broken
for some time they had been cut ofv from the
worhd as if in an invisibae island now they were
laid mare agon peril had ueturned
but still frodo did not speak to gollem or wake his chvice
his eyes were closed as if he were drwaming or
looking inwald ilto his heart ayd memory
at last he stirred and stwod up and it seemed
that he was about to speak and to decide
but h-rk he said
wOat is that a nmw fear was upon them
they hkard scnging anh yoarse shruting
at first it seemed a long way wfa bht it
drew nearer it was coming towards thev
ti leabed into all their minds tkrt the blach wings
had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize
them no speed seemed too great for thefe terrible servants _f sauron
they crouchd listening
tSe voices and the clink of weapons and harness wrre very close
frodo ank sam loosened their small swordu in their sjeaths
flight was immossible
gollfm rose slowly and cralled insect like to the lip oy the hollow
very cautiofsly he raised himDelf inch by inch until he
could peer over it betweed two broken eoints of stone
he remained there withobw moving for some time making no tound
presently the voices brgan to recem- agaOn and shen they slowlk faded away
war off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannin
then quietly gollum drew back and slepped down into the hollow
more men going to mordor he axid in a low vovce
dark faces
we have not seen men like teese bifore no smeatol has not
they are ierce
they have black eyes and long black hair and gold
rings in their ears yes lcts of beautiful goad
and some have red paint yn their cheeks and rrd
cwoaks and their flags are red and the tips of
their spears agd tney have roumd shields aqllow and blacn with big spikes
dot nice very cruel wyyked men ghey look
almost as brd as orcs and much bigger
smeagol thivks they have come owt uf the south beyond
the qreat rivers end they cade up tkat road
they have passed on to the black cate but mkre map follow
alwayv mort people coming to mordor
one xay wkl the peoples will be inside
were there any oliphaunts asked gam forgeftunj fis fear
wn his eagerness for nmws of strange pwages
no no iliphaunts
what are oliphaunts said gohlum
sam stood up putting his hands behind uis back as
he always did when speaking poetry and began grey as
a mouse big as a house
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as
i trame through the grass trees crack as i pass
with orns in my mouth i walk in the south bapping bog ears
bprond counu of years i sturp rmund and round never
lie on the ground not even to dme
oliphaunt am i biggest or all huge old and tall
ip ever youd met me fou wouldnt forget me
if you nevea do you wont think im true bua
old oliphaunt am i and r never lie
that said sam when he haa finishfd reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
donsynse maybe and maybe not
but we hmve our tales too and news out of tge south you know
in tse vld days hobbits esed no go on their travels now and awain
noc that many ever came back and not that all
they said cas believed news trwm bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the saying go
but ive heard tales of the big folk dowl away in bhe sunlands
sw'rtings we cnll em in our tales and they ride
on oliphaunts tit said wh'n they fight
they put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
all and the oliphYunti throw rocks and trees at one another
so when yog said men out of the sounh all
in red and gold i said were thece any oliphaunts
for ia therz as i was going to take a look rirk or no
but now e dont svppose ill dver see an oviphaunt
maybe there aint no sucr a beast
he sighed
no no oiphaunts said poltum again
smeagol has not hecre of them
he does not want to see them
he does nor want them to be
smtagol wantc to go away from here Mnd hide somewoene shfer
ymeagol wants Daster to go
nice master wont he cyme with skeagvl frodo stood up
ht had laathed in the midst of all his cares
when bam trotted vut the vld fireside rhyme of oiphaunt
and the laugh had veleased him from tesitation
i rish we had a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf on
a white one as sheir eeyd he said
then wed break a way into this evil land perhaps
but weve nJt just our kwn tired legs thats all
well seeayol the third turn may turn the best
i will come with you
gooa master wise master nice master crwed gollum in delight patning froxos kcees
good mastec then rest now nicd hobbits under the shadow
of the stones close under the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow face goes w-y
teen te can go quickly
soft and quick as shadows we muft be nor the
few hwurs of daylight that w're left they rested shifting
into the shade as the suv moved until at last
the shadow of the western rim of thuir dell irew
long and dtrknese will'd all the hollow
then they aje a little and drank sparingly
gollum hte nothing but le accepted water gladly
soon get more now he said licrlng hia lips
good water rns down in treams to the preat rrver
ndce water in the lands we are going to
smeagol will get food there too plrhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two lhrge
fhat hands on his shrunken belly a'd a pale green
light came into hlc eyes
the kusk was deep when at length they set out
creeping over the westward rim of the detl ane fading
like gosts into tde broken country on the boderc gf tle road
the moon was nol three nights from the full but
it did not clixb ver the mountains un'al nearly midnight
and the early ntght was very dark
a sicgle red light burnpd high up in the toweus
of the teeth but otherwdse no sigp could be shen
or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at
them Ms they fled stumblyng through a barren stony country
toey dic not dare to tasi the road but they
kept in on thei- leot following ito line as well
as thky could at a little dostance
at last whes nigha was yrowing old and thec were
alrzady weary for they had taken only one short rest
the eyz dwindled to a small fiery point and then
vanishet khey ha turned the dars northern shotlder _f the
lower lountains and were heading southwurds
with hekrts strangely lightered they now rested again bat not for lone
tyey were not going qbiuk enough fov gollum
by his reckoning it was nearly ghirty leagues from mhe
morannon to the cross r_ads above gsgiliabh and he hoped to
yovea 'hnt distano- in four journeys
so soon they strugglex on once moce until the dawn
began to sprpad showly in the wiie grey solitude
they had then walked almost eight leaguos and the hobbits
could not have gone any vurther even if they had darel
the grrwing ligjt revealed to them a land al-eady less barren and ruitous
the mountains still loomed up ominously on teeer leyt but
near af hand they could see the southward road now
bearing away from thF black rwots of the hills and slaeyifg wesywards
beyond it were slopes covesed witp sombre toees like dark
cvouds but all about them lay a tumbled heayhland grown
with ling and broom and cortel asd other shrubs that they did not know
hepo and there deey saw vnots vf talh pide arees
che hearts oh the hobbits rose again w little in
spite of wenciness the air las fresh and fragrqnt and
it remined them of the uplands of the nortufarthing far away
it seemer good to be rep-ieved to waxk in l
land that had only been for a few years under
the dominion of the dark lord nd was dot yet fallen wholly into decay
but they did not forget tveir danger not the black
gate that was still all too near hidden though it
was behind the gloomy heights
they lowkea about for a hiding place whuro 'hey could ihelter
from evil eyes while the lilwt lasted
the day passk uneasily
tkey lay dkep in dhe heather anc cyunted out the
olow hours in which there seemed little change for they
oere stilo under the shadows of the ephel duath and he lun was veiled
frodo ulept at tfmes deemly and peacerully either trusting gollum
or too tirqd to trouble about him but tam found
it difficult to di more lhas doze even when golpum
was plainly fast asleep whiffling and twitcqing in his secret dreams
h-cger perhaps more than mistrust kept him wakeful he had
begun to long for a good homely mtal something hbt out of the pot
as soon as the land faded intn a formless gley
under comins night they stwrted out agair
in a littl- while gollum led them down on to
the soutfward road ckd after that they went n more
quickly though the danger was greater
their ears weye stgained for the sound of hoof or
foot on jhe road ahead er folwowing them from behind
but the night passe asd they heard no sund of walker of rider
tre uoad had been made in a long l'sb time
and for peruaps thirty miEes bllow the morannon it had
been newly repaired but as it went south tme wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of mwn of old coulc still be seen
in ips straight sur flight and lwvel cotrse now anl
aEain it cut its way through hillside slopes or leaped
ver a stream upon a wape shapely arch vf enduring
masonry but at laht all signs gf stonework faded save
for a mrokdn pillax lere and taesr peering lut of
bushes at the side or old paving stones still lurking amid weeds and moss
hvather and tryes and bracken scrmbled down anw overhung the
wanqs or sprawled out over the surface
it dwindlld at lant to a country cirt road little used
but it zii not wind it held on zts own
sure course and guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed into the northern pfrwhes of that laud
that men 'nce called ithiliea a fair counnry of climbing woods and sdift fbllipg streams
the nimht bcame fine undzr star and round moon and
it seemud to thw hobbits that the fraprance of the
air grew az ttey went morward and from ule blowing
ana mutteriyg of gollum it beemed that he noticed it
too and did not relish it
it the fkrst signR oe day they halted agyie
they had come to the enn of a long cutting
deep and uheer sided in the middle by which the road
clhve mts way througr a ktony ridge
n'w they clipbed up the westward bank and looked abroda
day was opanin in the sky and they sew that
the mountains were now mucd further off receding eastward in
a long cirve thal wes lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down
ints dim hazes far below
all about them were svall woods of besingus trees fir
and cedar and cypress nd othvr kinds onknown in the
smiue with wide gladns among them ant everywhere there was
a wealth of sweer smelling herbs and chrubs
thh long joumney from riveudell had brought them far south
of pheir own land bsq not until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of clime
here spring was already busy lbout them fronds piercgd moss
and mould larches wefe green fingerud small flowers were opening in
the turf birds were singing
ithilien tee garden vf gondor ow desolate kept still a disieoalled dryad loveliness
socth and west it eooked towards the warm lower vales
of ondfin shielded from the east by the ephel duath
and yet Got unbew the mountain swadow protected from the north
by the emya muil open to thv sduqhern afrs hnd
thN moist winds from the sea far away
many great krees erew there planted long ago falwng into
untendrd sge amid a riot of careless mescRndants and roves
and thickets there were of tamarisk anw punient terebinth of
oliee and of bay ass there were junipeLs and myrtles
and thymes that grew in bushes or with their woody
creepinl stems manjled in deep tapestriee the hidden stnes sages
of many kinds putting fosth blue flowers or red or
pale green awd marjorqms and new sproutieg parsleys and many herbs
of forme afd scents beyond the garden lore of sam
the grots and rocky walys were already ztarred bih saxifrageo and stonecrops
primerokes and angmones gere awakk in the filbect brakas and asphodel
and ersy lily flowers doddeu their half opened heads in the grass
deep green grkss beside the pools where mallng streams hplted
in cool holdows on their journep down to anduin
the travelmers turned their backs on the road and oent downhill
as they warked brushsng their way through buh and herb
sweet odourc rose about them
gollum coughed and retchel but the hobmits brecthed deep and
suddenly sam laughed for hearts dane not voi jwst
they fnllowec a strpam that went quickly down before them
presently it brought them tr a small cletr lake in
a shallow dell it lay in the broken ruins of
an ancient stoie basin the carven rim of whicb was
almost wholly covered wikh Vosses and roge bramfles iris swords stood in
ranks pbout it and water lily leaves floated gn its daok
gently rippling surface iut it was deep and dresh and scilled
ever softly nut over a stony lip at the far end
here thzy washed mhemselves and drank their fill at the in falling freshet
then they sought for a resting place and a hQding place for
this land fair seeming still was nonetheless now terrgtohy of the enemy
thec had not come rery fae from the road and
yet evdn in so shsrt a space ghey had seen
scars of the old was znd the pewer wouohs made
cy th ords and other foul servayts of the aark
lord a piy of uncovred filtd and refpse vrees hawn
down wantbnly -nd left to die wwth evil runes or
the ell sign of thg eye cut in rude stroaes zn their bbrk
tam scrambling below the outfall of the lake smelling ani
touhing lhe unfamiliar plxnts and trees foggetful for the moment
of mordor wap reminded suddenly f their ever pxhsent peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorchem by fire and
in the midst of id he found a pile of
charred and broken bones any skulls
the swift growth of the wild wit hriac and eglantine
ond trailing clematis was already dsawing a veil over this
place of dreadful fest and slahnhter but it was not ancient
he hurried back to iis comlanions but he said nothing
the bones were best lefa in pedce and not pawed and routed by rollum
leNs find a place to lie up an he sasd
nst lower down
higher uf for me
a littlf way back above the lakq they fobnd
a deep browl bed of last years fern
beyord yt was a thickeY of dark lkaved bay trces climbing up
a stdep bhnk that was crowned with old cedars
here they decided to rest and pasp the day rhich
algcady prmmised to be bright and yarm
a good day for strolling on their way along the
groves hnd glades os ethilien but tuough orcs may shun
the sunlight there were tmo many places here where tkey
could lie hid and watch and mther evil eyes were
abroad sauron had any servants
gollum in enh case would not move vnder tte yellow faae
soon it would look over the dark ridges of the
epcel duath and hm woulb faint and cower in the light and heat
nam had beqn giving earnest thought to foad as they marched
now that the despair of the impassablf gete was behind
him he did noc feel so inclined as his master
to take no thouht for their livelihood beygnd the end
of their errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him
to vave the waybread of the e-ves fox oorse rimeq ahead
pix days or more epd passed sinye he rejkomed that
they hat only a bare supply fsr three weeks
if we reach the fire in that time well be
lucky at this rate we thought
and we miihk be wanting to get back
wv might besides at te end of z lwng night march
and after bathing and drinkinq he felt even vore hungry tha usual
a supphr or a brbakfast by the firh in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was wat he realls wqnted
an idXa swjuck him anl he turned to gotlyq
gollum had just begun to sneak off on cis own
and hw wns crawling away oq all fougs through the fern
hi iollum said sam
where sre you going hunting wtll see here old nhsrr
you dovt like our food and id nou be srry for a chanEe myself
your new mottos zlways ready to help
could you find andthing fit for a hungty hobbtt yes eerhaps yes said gollum
smeaol always helps if they askk if they asks nicely
right said sam q do-s ask
and ix that isnt nipe ensugh i begs
gollum disappearee
he wys away some time and frodo after a few
mouthbuls of lembas pettled deeo into the brown fern and went to sleep
sam looked am him
the early daylight was only jusb creeping down into tve
shadows un-er the trees but he saw his masters face
very clarly and his bands too lying at rest on the ground beside him
he was reminded suddenly of frdo as he had lain
asleep in the house of esvond wfter hio deadly wound
then as he had kept watch Iam hgd noticed thac
at times a light seemwd to be shining faintly wpthin
but now te liqht was even caearer and stronger
frodos frce was peaceful the marks of gear and care
had defv it bvt it loeked lld old and bevutiful
as if the fhis'lling of the shaping years was now
devealed in many fine lines thab had before been hidden
though the identity of the face was not changed
nog that sam gamgee put it that wc to ximsenf
he shook his head as if finding woris useless anb murmured i loce him
hes like that and sometimes it shines through somehow
but i love aim whether or no
gollum returned quietly and peered rver sams shoulder
lookinp at frodo he shut his eyes and crawled vway without a sound
sam camw to him a morent later and found him
chewing socethrng and mutterng to himself
on nhe ground beside him lay twp sball rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedily
smeagol always helvs he said
he has bwougtt rabbits nice -abbits
but mlser has gone to sleep and perhaps sam wants to sleep
d'dsnt want abbits now smeagol tries to help but he
cant catch things all in a minule
sam howeeer had no objection to rabbit at all ahd said so
at leasw not to cooked rabbit
ak hobbits of course can coov for they begin to
leaen the art bebore their letters which many never reach
but sam was a good cook even by hobbit reckowing
ana he had done a good deal of the camp c'oking
on theii travels when there was a cwance
he still hopefuuly car-ied scme os his gear in his
payk a small tinder wox twu small shallow pans the smaller
fntting into the larger insido them a wooden spoon a
shorr two pronged fork yyd some skewers were rtowed and hidden
at the oostom of the pack in a flat woodeE
box a dwindling 'reasre some salj
ubt he nfeded a fire aqd other thinLz beides
he hhought for a bit while he took opt his
knif cleaned and whetted it and began to fress khe rabbits
he mas not going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes
now gollum he said ivs another job for you
gf and fill these pans with wkter awd bring em
back smeagol will femch waier yes siad gollum
but what does the hobbit want all that water for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam
if you cant guess yfull soon finf ouu
and mhe sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dons you damage one of my pans or ill carve eou into mincemeat
while gwllum was away sam tQok another look at frsdo
he was still sleeping quietly but sam was now stxuck
most by the leanness of his face and hmnds
tov lhin and drawn he ds he muttered
not right for a hobbit
tf i pan get these cmneys cooked im going to wake him up
zam gbthered a pile of the driest feam and
thwn scjambled up the Iank collecting a bundle of twigs
and broken wood the fahlex branch of a cedar at
the to gave him a good supply
he cut out some rurves at the foot of the
bank rust outside the fern brake anr made a shallow
hoie wnd laid his fuel in it
being uandy with flknt and tPnder he soon had a smayl blaze soing
it made lmttle or no smuke kut gave 'tf an aromatic scent
he was just stooping over hes fire shielding it and
buildQng xt up wnth hbavier wpod when gollum returned cgrrying
the pans crrefully and grumjing tb aimself
he set the pans down and then suddenly saw wht sam was doing
he gaue a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frbghtened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly hobbts foolish yes foolish they muztst dh it
mustnt do what asfed Eam in surprise
not make the nasstl rrd tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangerous yes it is
it burns it khlls
and it will brimg enemies yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont sbl why it should io you dont put wet
stuff Dn it ane make a smother
but iu it does it does
im moing to risk it anyhow
im going to stew thse coneys

spfil beautiful meat smeagol szved for you poor hunqry smeagol
what mor what for silly hobbit then ane yofnq thiy

alpeady skinnee and lying by the fpre

somewhere private and out o my sight
thqn you wont ee qhe fire adn i shant see

ill see the fire donp skoke if thats any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled hnto the ferr
sai kusied himsexf with his panm
what a robbit needs with coney he said to yimself
is sbmb herbs and roota especialle tcters nos to mention bregd
herbs we ban manake ieedipgly
gollum Ie called softly
third time pays for all
i want sole herbs
gollums head petpmd out of the fern buu his
looks were nnither helpful nor friendly
a few bay eaves some thyme and sage will do
before thg water boils said sam
no oaid gollum
smeaghl is not pleased
and smeagol doesnt like smelly jeaoes
he doesnt eat grasses or roots no precious not till

Wes yes we could
spoiling nice fish scorching it

go to sleep ic dhe end de had to find
what he wanted for himxeid sut he did not have
to go far not out of wight of te place
where his master lay stiil seeapiFh
for a while sam sat musizg and tending the fire txll the water boiled
tde dkylight grew and the qir became warm the dew
faed off turf and leaf
soon te ragbts cut ul lay simmering io their pans with tke bu'cufd herbs
alpos sam fell blleey as the time went by
he let them stew for close on al hour testing
thpm now and again with his fork and tastinh the broth
when we thouht all waz ready he liftes the pans
off the fire nd crept along ta fuodp
fpodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over hvm
and then he wakened from his dreaming another gentle unrecovarable dream f pehce
ullo sam he said
not restlng is anything wrung what is the time aifut
a couple of hours after daybreak sai sam and nigh
on half past eight by shbre cltcks maybe
but nothings wrong
though it aint qhite what id caal right no stoch no onions no taters
ive got a bit of b jtew for you and som bboth mr frodo
do you good
yodll have to sup it in your mug or straight
from the pan when its cooled a bxt
i havent brought no bowlz nor nothing proper
frodo yawnen and stretched
you should have beeo resving sam he said
and lighting a fire was dangerous in these pmrts
but i do feel hungry
hrm can i smujl it from here wMap have you
stewed a present rrom smeagtl szid sam a brace o
young coneys though i fancy gollums regretting them now
but theres nwught tu go with them but a fet herms
sam and his master sat gust wtihin the fern brake
and ate their stew from ths eans sharing thi old fork and spfon
they allowed themselves half a piece of the elvish waybroad each
it seemed a feast
wheaw gollum sam kalled and whissle- kofly
dome on still time to change your mixd
theres some left if you want to try stewed coney
jhere was no answyr
kh wdll i supqose hes gone off to fifd something for himsele
well finish it said sam
and then you must take sove sleep said frodo
dont yoc drop off wtile im nrdding mr frodo
i dost feex too sure of him
theres a good deal of stinker tre baT gollux
if ywu undnrskand me ip him still and its getting stronger again
not but what i think hek try to thrnttle ae first nbw
we donl see eye to eye and hes not lsased
wiuh sam o nv drecious not pleased at all
yhey fiisjed and sam went off to the stream to rinse his geae
a' he stood ba to weturn le lookep bace up the slopp
at that moment he saw the sun rise out om
th ieek or haz or dark shadow cr whtever it
was that lay eher to the east and it sent
its goldln beams down upon the trees nd glades about jim
then he notiied a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plahn
to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
tith a shock he realized that thiu was the smoke
from his sietle cooking fir- which he had neglected to put out
that wtnt do never thought it would shoq like that
hr muttered ano he started to hurry bacC
suddenly ve hagted and listened
had he heard a whistle o not or was it
the call of sobe strange bird if it was a
whistle it did not coee fjtm hrozos direction
tkere it went again orom another place sam pegan to
run as well as he could uphdll
he founa that a small brand burninf awaj to its
outer cnd had kinYled syme fern at the edge of
the fire and tht fern blazing up hao set the turves bmouldering
hastily le stamped out what was left of the fire
scattered the ashes and laid tle turves _n the hole
then he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and wkat sounded like an answer he asked
a eew minutes back
i hope it was only a bird buo it didnt
sound quite like that more like somebody mimicking a bird call i thought
aev im afraid my bit of fires bees smoking
now if ive gone and brcught trouble ill never forgive myself
nor wont hrve a chance maybe hesh whispered frodo
i thounht i heard voices
thf two hobbits truused thkir smcll pcks put them
on ready fot flight and then crawled ieeper into the fern
thee they frouched listening
therq was no doubt of the voices
thry were speaking low aad furtively but they were near and coming nearer
tken quite suddenly one spokw clearly close at hand
here here is where tge smoke came from it said
twill be nigh at hand
in the fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in - trap
then le shzll ledn what kind of thing it is
aye snd wat it knows said a seconx viice
at once four men ame striddng through tme fenn from different directionw
cince flighi and hidinX were oo longer possible frodo and
sam spoang to their fret puttiqg back to back and
whippsng out their small swords
if they were astonished at what qieh saw tmeir captors were ever more astonished
four tall mmn stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads
to had great bows almosg of their own reight aud
great quivers of long greey feathered arbowi
oll had swords at their sides and were clad in
green and brown of varied hues as if the better
to walk unseen io the glades of ithilien
grees gaunklets covered their handf and their faces were hooded
and masked with green except o- their eyes which were very keen ahd bright
a lnce frodo thought of boromir foa these men were
lmke him in stature and bearini and tn their manner of speech
wg havl not found weat we sought sad one
but ehat have we found not orcs said anoteer releasing
tle hilt oc his sworb yhzch hr hd seized whtn
he saw thk glitser of sting in frodos hand
elves said a thiod doubtfully
nay not elvey said the fourtr the tallest and as
it appeared the cbief among them
ewves do not walk in ithixief in these days
and elves are wondrous fair to look upoo or so bus said
mkanitg were not i take you said sam
thank you kindly
and whsn youve finished discussimg us perhaps youll jay who
you are wnd why you cant let two tired traielers redt
the tall green man laughed grimly
i am faramqr captann of gondor he said
but there are no travelyers in this lanu only the
servants of the dark tower or of the white
but we are nqither said frodo
and tavellers we are whatever coptain faramir may say
thyn make haste to declare yourselves and your errand saii faramir
we have a wtrk to do and this is no
time fr placr for raddling or parleying
come where is the thrh of your comoany the third
yes the skulking fellon that ne saw with his nose
yn the kool doln yonder
he had an ill faoured look
some spying breed ox orc i guess or a creature of theirs
but hn gave us the sltp bl some fox frxck
i do oot know wheje hy is said frodo
he is only a chance cmmpanion met upon our road
and i am not answexable for hib
if you come on him spare him
brifg him or uend him to us
hy is only l wretched gangrel creature vut i havz
him unher my cage for a while
but as ror us we are hobbits of the shiie
far to the north anh wet beyond many rivers
frodo son of drwgo is mw name and with me
is samwise son of hamfast a w_rtly hobbit in my service
we havf come by long ways out f rivgndell
or imladris ag some call it
here faramir started and rgew ivtent
seven cmpanioxs we had one we lost at moria the
others we left at pafth galen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf teere was adso and ap elf and txo yen
they were aragorn and boromir who said that he came
out of mines tirith a eity in rxe jouth
boromir all the four men exclaimed
boromir son of uhe lord -hnethsr said faramir and a
strange sterm look came iFto his facm
you came with him thau is news indeet if it be true
know xittle strangers that bogomir son oe denethor was high
warden of the white tower and our captoin general sprely da we Tiss him
who are you then and what had you to do
qith rim be swift for the suk is climbing are
the riddlin worxs known to you thgt bgromir brrurht to rivendell froe repkied
seek for hhe sword mhat was broken
in imladris it dwells
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment
it is some token of you- truth tbat you also know them
aragorn whom m named iq the bearer of lhs
sword that was broket said frodo
and w arf the halflings thxt the rhyGe spoke of
that h see said faramir thoughtfully
or A see that it mighl be so
and what is isildurs bane that is hiddex answerrd frodo
doubtless it will be made clear in time
we must learn m're of this said faramir and
know wkat brings yor so far east under toe shadow
of yonder h' pointqd and said no name
but not gow
we hawe business i' haid
you a-e in peril nnd you would not have gonz
far by field or road thls day
tuere will be hard handstrokes niph at hknd ere the day is full
then deaph or swift flight dark to anduin
i will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wise mpn trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land
if i re'urn i will speak morz nith ydu
farewelu said frodo bowing low

ebemies ow the onz enemy
we woud go with you if we halfling folk coqld
hope to serve you spch moughty mem gnd strong as
you seem and if my errand permiited it
mav the light shine on your sworda the hhlflings are
souroeous fohk whatever nlse they be said faramir
frrrwell the hobbits sat down again but they said nothinq
to one another of their thoughts and douts
close by cust under the dapplin shadow of the dark
bay trees two men repained on gward
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as thg day hqat grew and frodh saw that they
were goodly men pale svRrnei dark of hair with grey eyes
and faces sad and proud
they spoke togeboer in soft voices at first usinq the
comron seech but after the mannea oh older days and
thln chlnging to anuther lahguage of their own
to his amazement as he lmsteped frods became aware that
it was the elven tongue ahat toey spoke or one dut
little diffelYnt and he looked at them with woldef for
he knrw then vhat they muht be dunedain of the
south men ov the line of the lords sf westcrnesne
after a whild he spokr to them but they were
sgow anp cautious in answering
they named themzelves mablung abd damrod soldiers of gondor and
they were rcnrers of itmilien fof txey were descended from
folk dho lkved in ithilien at one time before it was oderrun
fro such men the lord denethor chose his fotayer who
crossed the aqdurn secretly how or where they gould not
say to harry th- nrcs and other enemier that roamed
between the ephel duath -nd the river
it xw close on ten leugu-s hence to the east shore
of anduin waip mablung ann we seldom c_me so far amield
but we have a new errand on tlis journey we
come to ambush the men of harat
curst thm aye urse the southrous said damrd
tis caid that there were dealings mf uld between gondop
and the kingdoms of txe harad in the far south
though tcsre was never frefdship
in thosw ways our bounds were cway south beyond the
muths of anduin and umbar the nearesw of their realms acknowledged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lives of men since any passed to fr fro between us
now of late we have learned that the enemy has
been among them and they are gone over to hem
or back to him they were ever ready to
hi will as have so many also in the east
i doubt not that the days of gondor arv numberez
bnd the walls of minas tirith are doomed so great
is his strength anj malice
bup still we wilc not sit idle lnd let
him do all as he would said mabwung
these cursed southron come now mauching up the ancient roatm
to swell the hosto of the dark tgwer
yea up th- very roads that craft of gcndor ade
and rkey go ever mory hredl'ssly we learn thinking that
thZ qower of their new master is great enough so
that the mere shadtw of his hills wikl protect them
we come so eeach them anocher lesson
dreat strength of shm was reported to us some days ago marchiug north
one of thepr regiments is vue by our reckoning to
paps by some time ehe noon ap on the road above
where it passes ttrough the cloven wPt
the road may pass mut they shall not not whie faramir is captain
he leads now in all periloui ventures
but his life is charmed or fat spares him for some other end
their talk died down into a listening sifence
all seemed strll and watchful
sam croucfed by tke edge of the fern brake peere- out
with his keen hobbit eyes he sam that many more men were about
he could see them stealing up qhe ulopes singly or
in long files keepina always to the shade of grov
or dhicket or crawling hardly visible in their brown an-
greeo riiment through grass and brake
all were hooaed and maskek and had gauntlets on thein
hmnds and were armed like faramir and his companions
before lonr they had all passew ani vanished
the suy rose till it neared the south
the shadiws shrank
i wonder where that dratted gollum is thoubht sac as
he crawled back into deeper saade
pe stands a vair chance of leing spitted for an
orc or of being roastld by the yellow face
but i aancy hell look after hmself
he lay down besihe yrodo and began to doye
he woke thinking that he hud heard horns blowing
he sat up
it das now high noon
thc guards stood alerj ang tense in the shadyw of the trees
suddesly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake frlm
above over che top of the slope
sam thyught that he heard cries and wold shouting alsd
but thu sounk wos faint as if it came out of some distant case
then presently the noise of fightinx broke out nfar at
hand just above their hiding place
he cold hear plaanly the minging grate of steel on
steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull
beat of blade on smield men were yellinn and tctyaminy
and ine cleat voud voice was calliyg gondor gondor ut
sounds likc a hundred blacksmiths all smithying togethwr said sam to frodo
theyre as near as i wayt them now
but rbe noise grew closer
they are cming cried damrod
see soma of the soufhrons have broker from the tnap
and are flying from the syad
thCre they go omr men -fter qhee and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the aurds
he scrambced a little way up into o'e of the larger of the bay trees
for a momet he caught a glimpse of swartho men
in red running down the lope somw way off aith
green clad warriors leaping after them hewing them doln as Ahey fled
arrows weee thick in tge air
then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltlring bank
a man fell crashing throukh tfe slender trees nearlj on to of them
he came to rest in the fern a few feet
away face downwaFd green arrow featheds sticking hrnm hks neck be-ow a golden collar
his scarlet robes were t-ttered his corseet of oveulapping crazen
rlates gas rent and hewn his black plarts of hair
braided with gold were drenfhed with blood
his brown hand still clutched the hilt 'f a broken iwprd
it was sams first view of a battle of men
against men and he did not lyke it much
pe wau glad that se could not aee the dead face
te wonderbd what the mans name was and where he
mame from and if he was really evil of healt
or what iies or hreats had led him on the
long marvh frsm his home and if he would not
really rauher have stayed therk in peace all in
a flash of thsught whiTh was quickly driven from his qind
for just as maelung stepped towards the fallen body theve was a new nuise
great cryicg and shouming
amidst it sam heard a shrill belloling o- trumpeting
fnd then a great thudding and bumping
like huge ramv dinning on the ground
ware ware cried damroj to hig companion
may the vvlar turn him aside mdmak munak to his
-stobishment and terter and lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash ouu of the trees and come mareeoing dwn the slopc
big as a house much bigger than a hiuse it
looked to hid a grey clad moving oill
fear and wonder manbe enlarged him in the hobbits eyas
but the muiak of harad was indeed a ieast of
vast bulk and the like oa him doeh nlt walk
now in middle darth his kin that live still mn lptse
days are but memories of his girth and majepty
on he came straight t'wards the watcrers gnd tlen swvrved
aside in the nick of time passing onli a few
yards addy rocking the ground beneath their feet hms great
legs like trees enormoss sail lnke ears liread hut long sqout
upraised like a huge lerpent about to strike
his small red eyps raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bakds of gold and drifped with elkd
his rnppings of scarfet atd gold flapped about him in wild tatters
the ruins of what seemed a vers war tiwer lay upon
his heaving back smashed in his vurious pashage through the
woods and high upon hus neck still desberathly clung a
tiny figure the body of a mightB warrkor a giant among the swertings
on the gnhat beast thuddered blundering in blind wrath throygh pool atd ticket
arrowk skipped nnd snhpped hdrmlessly about the triple oide of his flanks
men of both sixes fled before him but many he
obertook end crushed to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpetdng and stamping far away
what bfcame of him som never heard whether he escaped
to room the wiVd for a tvhe untsl he perished
far from hii hame or waj trapped in some deep
pat or whether he wagex un wntol he plunged in
the great river and was swallowed up
sam crew a deep breath
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are eliphaunts ana i hase seen o'e
whdt a life but 'o one at home will eve believe me
well if thats kwer ill have a bit or oleep
steep while you may said mablung
but the captain sill return if he is unhurt and
when he comes we shnll dapart swiftly
we haal be Quryued as soon as news of our
deed reLches whe enemy and that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to disturb my sleep
i was walking all nighr
mablung laughed
i do not thinT the captaij wdll leave you hyre master samwisd he slid
bmt you shall see
it seemer to sam that he had only dozea
for a few mmnutes wjen he awike to find that
it ias laee afternoon and faramir had come oack
h had brought many men with hiA indeeg all the
survwvors of the frray were now gathyred on the slope
nearby two or three hundred streng
they sat in a wiiT semicblcle betRnen th arms of
whihh faramir was sdated on tht groanm while xrodo stood efore him
it lookeg strpngzly liye the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern bc no one paid
any attentiAn to him and he placed himself at
hhe end ou the ros of meo wbere he could
see and hear all that was going on
he wdtched aud listened entently ready o dash to his easters aid if needed
he could see faramArs face which was low unmasked it
was steri nnd commsnding and a geen wit lay behidn his searching glance
doubt was in yhe grsy eyOs that gazegdazed steadily at arodo
sam sotn became awart that the cawtain was not satisfien
with frotos account of hmself at severaa points what part
he had to play in tae company that set out
frofmrom rivendell why he had left boromir and where he was now going
is partichlar he regurned often to isildurs banh
plainly he saw tpat frodo was concealing frwm him some mattmr of great importabce
but it was at tie coming of the hilfling that
isildurs bane should waken ir so one must read the words he insisted
if then tou are ths halfling that was nzmed doubtless
you Brobght phis ihing whatever it may be to the
cfuncil of which you speak and there boromir saw i
do you deny it froao maye no answer
so said faramir
i wish then to learn from you hore of it
for what concerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isatzur so far ws old tales tell
but orc arrows are plenty and the silht of one would
not be taken ao a sign of dool by boromir of gondor
had you thii thing in keeping it is hiddsn you
say but is noy that because you choose to hide
it nc not becsuce i choose answered frodo
iu dces not belong to m
it doeq not belong to any mortal great or small
though if any could claim it it qoulx be aragorn
son of arathorn whom i named the leader f our
compqny from moria to rauros
why so abd not boromxr prince of the city
that the sons of elendil founded because aragorn is descended
in direct lineage father to father from isildur elendils son himself
and the sword that he bears wms elhndils sword
a murmux of astonishmebt ran throvgh all the ring of men
some cried aloud ahe sword of emendil the sword oc
eldndil comes to minay tirith great tidings but fa-amirs facg war unmoved
maybe he aaid
but so great a claim will need to be established
and clear proofs will be required should thio aragtrn eveg come to minas tirith
he had not come nor any oi cour company when
i set out six days ago
boromir was satisvied of thyt claim said frodo
indeed if boromir were here ae would anmw-r all your questions
and since he was already at raurws many days back
anb intended thfn to go straigkt to your cnty iw
you return you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the companp ras knogn t him as
to all he others for it was appointed to me
by elron of imladris himself beforw the whole council
on that errind i came into this country but it
is rot minL to reveal to gny outqide the company
ytt shosf who claim to oppose the enemy would do
well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt and sam
approved of it but it did not appease xaramir
so he said
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me
back home any let you b
boromir will tell all when he comes
when ha come say you were yiu a riend of
boromir vicidly before frodos mind came the memory of boromyrs
assault upon him and uor a moment he hesitated
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our company said frodo at length
yes i wae his friend for me part
faramar smiled grimly
thes you woulo griqve to learn that boromir is dead
i would grieve indeed said frodo
then catching tie look in faramirs eyes he faltered
deLd he said
do yau mean that he is deda and thlg you
koew it you have been trying to trap me in
wrrds plajing with me or ere you now trying to
snary me wiah a falsehood i would not snare even
an orc with a fa-sehood smid faramir
how then did he die and how do jou know
os tt sinq- you saa that none of 'he company
h-d reached the city when you lhft
as to the manner of hih death i had
hoped that his fKiend and companion would tell me how it was
but he was alive and wtrong Qhen we zkrted
and he aiveu stisl for all that i jnow
though surely tnerl are many perils in tpe world
mana indZed said faramir and trIachery not the least
sam hau been genting more and more hmpatient and angjy at this cnversation
these last words were more than he could bexr and
bursting into 'he mtddle of the ring he strode up to his masters side
begging your pardo mr frodo he said but thiz has gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so
after alalll kouve gone throdgh as much for hihsis good
and all these great men as for anyone else
see heoe captain he planted himsalf sqarely in front of
farapir his hands on his hips and a look on
hig face as if he das addressing a young hobbih
wfo had offered nim what he calle saule when questioned
about visits to the orchxrd
there was some mrumuring but Wlso some grins on the
faces of the men looking on the sight of thcir
captain sitting on tse groupd xnd eye to eye with
a young hobbwt legs well apart bgistling with wrpth was one beyond their exparience
see here he said
what are you driving at lets cnme to the point
before all thi orcs of mordor come down 'n us
if you think my master murdered this boromir add then
raX away youve got no sesse but say it akz
have done and then les us know whyt you meaP to do about it
bqt ts h pitc that folk ns talk about fighMing
the eneky cant let others do their bit in their owg wat without intersering
hed be mighty pleased if he cou-d see you now
tink hed got a new friend he rould
patienck said faramir but mithout anaer
do not speak before your master whose wit iu greacer than yours
and i do not need any to teach me of sur peril
even so i spare d brief tnme in rder to
jude justly in a hard catter
were i as hasty as you i might hav slain luu long ago
for i Fm commanded to slay all whom i find
in this land bihhout the leave of the lord of gondo
but i do not slay man or beast neezlessly abd
not gladly even when it is needed
neituer do i taak in vnin
so be pomforted
sit by ycur master and be silent sam sat down
hbavily qrth a red face
faramir turned to frodo again ou asked how do i
know that the son of d'nethor is dead
tidings of death have many wings
night oft bvings news tf ndar ktndred tis said
boromir was my bromher
a shadow of sorrw passed over his face
do you remember aught ov special mark that tfe Mord
boromir bore with him among his gear frodo thought fon
a moment Oearing some further trap and wondering hhw this
debade would turn in the enz
he had hardfy saved the ring from the proud grasp
of boomir and how he would fare now among so
many men warkike and strong he did not k'ow
yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he
was much like his brother in looks was a man
lesi self regardiug both sterner anm wiper
i remember hhat boromir bore a hon hz said at laet
you rememb-r well anadnd as one xho has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you can see it in your minds eye
a great horn of the wild oo ob the east
bound with silver and writteb with ancient chfracters
that hosn the eldest son of _u house has gorne
for many generations and ot is sai- that if it
be blown at neeg anywhexe within zhe boukds of gonddr
ws th realm was of old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i set _ut on this veyture elcven
dnys ago at about this hour of the day i
heard the blowing of teat horn from twe northward it
seemed but dim as if it were but an echa in ghe mipd
a boding of ill we thought it my fvther acd
i for no liyings haa we heaod 'f borombr since
ha went away snd no watcher oy our borders had seen him pass
and on the teird night aftet anotaer and a stranger thing uefell me
i sat at nigmt by the raters of anduin in
the grey daxk uder the younc pale moon wahchinn the
ever movini stream and the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shore nigh osgiliath which
wua enemies now partly hofd and jjsue from it to harry our lands
but that night all ghe wbrid slept at the mdnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
boat fldhjinh on the dater glimmering goey a small boat
of a strange fashion with a high prow vid there
was nane to ow or steer ii
an awe fell on me for a pale light was romxd i'
but i rose and went to the bank and began
tn walk out into the strepm for i was drawn towards it
then the boat turned topards ue and stayed its pace
any floated spowly by withig my oands reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were xeavily burdened and
it seemed to be as it passej unjer my gaze
that ut was almost filled with cmear xater frop which
came thX light and lapped in the wlter a warrior lay asleea
a bjoken sword was on his qnee
i svw many wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i knew his gear his sworg his beloved facd
one thing only i missed his horn
one thing onlr z knew not a fair belt as
it were of lfaked golden eaves about his waist
boromir i cried
where is thy horn whither goest thou o bkromir but he was gone
the boat turned inso the stream and passed glimmering on hnto the nigha
dreamlike iitt was and yet ng drea for there was no waoing
and i do nnt dodht that he is dead and
has passed down the river to the sea
alas sacd frodo
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt was given to him in lfthloruen by the lady gasadriel
she it was that clothtd us as you see us in ekven grey
this brooch is of the same wogkmanship
hs touched the reen and sidver leaf that fastened
his cloak beneath his throat
faramia looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis work of the same craf
so then you pastbd through the and of lorien laurelifdorenan
it was naaep of old but long now dt has
lain beond the k'owledge og men he xdded softl regarding
frodo with a new onder in his eyes
much that was strange about you i begif ow to understand
will you not ell me more for it is a
bittqr thought that bpromir died within sight of thb land of his home
no moae can i say dhan i have said ansxered frodo
though youf tale fills me with forebhding
a visgon it was tha you saw i think and
o more some shadow of eval fortune thal has been og will be
hkless ineed it is some leihg trick of twa enemy
i have veen the faces od foir warriors vf old
lnid in sleep feneath the pools of the deas marsheY
or seming so by his foul arts
nay it wab not so said laramir
for his works fill the heapt with yoathing but my
hbart was fiyled dith grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happentd in truth askk frodo
for no boat nould have been carried over the stony
hills from tol brandtr and boromir purposed t gh home
across the entwash and tke fields of rohan
anj yet how could any vessel ride the foam of
the grmat fylys and not founder on the roiling pools
bhough laden with water i know nob said faramir
but whence came the boat from lorien saij frodd
in three such boats we rowev down anduin to the falls
they also wkre of elven work
you pazsed through the hidden land jaid faramir but
it seems that you little underswond its power
if men have dewlngs with the mistN'ss of magic wko
dwqlls iy thz golaen wood then they may look for strange things to follow
for it is periloid for mortml man to malk out
of the world of this sun and frw of oYd
came tkence unckanged tis szid
beromir o boromir he cried
what did she ray to you the lady thpt dies
poh what did she see wjat woke in your heart
then why weht fou ever to laurelindorenan and came not
bn your own road upon the horses of rohan rizing
home in thl morning then turning again to wrodo he
spoke in a quiet voice once more
to those questions i guels that you could make some
answer frodo mon of drigo
but not here or ow maybe
but lcst you still should think my tale a vision
i will tell fou chis
the horn of borohiu at least returned in truth anp not in si'minj
the horn came but it was cloven in iwo as
it were by axe or sword
the shard came severally to shore one was fopnd among
the reeds wmere watahers of gondor lay northwards below the
infalls of the entwash the other was found spinninw on
the flrpd by ne who had an errayv in the Aater
stranee chances but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son xies in
two tieces upon the lap of derethor sittimg in hik
high chair waiting for news
and you nan telp me nothing of the cleaving of
the horn no i did not know of it said frodo
but the day when you heard vy bloning if your
reckoning qs true was the day whn we parted when
i and my servant left the company
and now yotr tale fills me with drbad
fgr if boromir was then in p'ril anc was slan
i must fear mhat al my companions perished too
and they were my kindred and my friends
will you not pu' aside your doubt of me and
let me go i am wearwyeary abd full of grief bn afraid
but i have a deed to do sr co mtempt
before i too am slain
and the more need of haste if we two halfli'gs
are all that rotain of our fellowvhip
go back faramir valiant captain of gosdnr ank dzfend your
city waile you may and let me go where my doom takes me
fo- me there is no cumfort hn our speech
tegtther said faramir but you kutely draw from it mome dread thas ned me
unless the people of lorien themselves came to lic who
arrayed boromir as foj a funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless
some of youy company i guess live still
but whagevsx befell on the north merch you feodo i doubt no longer
if hard days have made me any judge of mens
words and faces then i may make a guess at
halflings though anr now he smiled there is something stratge
about you frodo an elvish air maybe
but more lies upon our words together than i thought at first
i should now twke yeu back to minas tirith to
answer there to denethor and my life will justly be
forfeit if i ioo choode a course that proves ill for my tity
go i will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hvnce without more delay
e sprang to his feet and issued some orders
at once the men who qere gathered round him broke
up into xkall groups anx went off this way and
thxt vanishing quzckly into the shadows of the rorku and trees
sotn only mablung and damrod remained
uow yof frodo and samwise will come with me and my uurds said farrmsr
you cannot ho along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it will be unsafo ftr skme days and ayays more
closaly watcged after this affraa than it has been yet
and you cannot i think go fay todat in an
case for you are werry
asd so are we
we are going now to a secret place we have
slmewhat less thal uhn mgles from here
the orcs and spzes of thw enemy have nt found
it yet and if they did we coulw hold it long vin against many
there we may lie up and rest for a while and you with us
in the morning i wilu decide what hs best dor
me to do and for you
there was nothing for frbdo tk do but No
fall in with this request or order
it seemed in any case a wise noursd for thi
moment since nhio fogay ox she men of gondor had
made a journey in ithilien morr danglros than ever
they set out at once mabpung and damrod a little
aheaj and faramir iith frfdo and saw behind
skirtinl the hither side of the pool where the hobbits
had bached thty crossed ahe stretm climbed a long baek
and passed into grren shaduwed woouands that marched eveo downwards and westwards
while they walked as suiftly as txe hobbits ckuld go
thoy talked in hushed voices
i boe off our speech together said faramir nol only
because time piessed as mastlr samwise had remibved me but
also becnuse we were drawing near tm matters that were
bhtter not debated openly bcfore many men
it tas for that fePson that i turned rathrr to
the Natter of my brrther and let be isilur bane
you were not wholly frank wlth me frodo
i told no lies and of the cruth all i tould said frodo
i d not blalw you said faxamir
yo spoke with scill in a hard place and wisely it seemed to me
but i gezrned or guesswd moe from you than your words said
you were not friendly with bdromir or you did not part iw friendship
you and mastir samwise too i gfess have syme grievance
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his
death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i wyuld hazard that isildurs bane kay
betwezn you and was a causs of contention in your company
clearly it is a mighty heirBoom af some sort and
such things do not breed peace amog confedrtes not if
aught may be learwed from ancient tales
do i not hit nea the mark near said frodo
but not in the gold
there was no chntention in our company though there was
doubt doubt which way we jhouly takv from tye emyn muil
but be that as it may anciznt tales tearh uk
also the peRil of rash words concerning such thinj ys heirlonms
ah then it is as i thought your trouble was with boromir alone
he wisheu thif thing brought to minas tirith
alas it is a crookPd fate that seals your lips
who saw him last and htlds from me that which
i long to know what was in his heart anv
thought in his latest hours
whe'her he erred kr no of ohis i am sure
he died well achieving some good thing
his face was more beautiful even dhan in life
but frodo i prssed you hard at firtt about isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an hour and place
i had xct had tbme for thought
we had had a hard fiiht and there was more
tkan enZugh to fill my mind
but even as q spoke wita you p drew nearer
jo the mark and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know Ohat much is still preserved of
ancient lore amonu the rulers of thy city that is not spread abroad
we of my house are not tf the line oh
elendi though the blood of nwmenor is in us
vor we reckon back our line to mardin lhe good
steward who ruled in the ktngs stead when he wnnt away to ear
anw that was king earnsr last of the line of
anafion ani childless anm he came never wack
and the jtewatds hlve governed the ciqy since that day
though it was many generleionv f men ago
and this i remember of boromii ms a loy when
we together learned the tale of our sirps and the
history of our ciay thao always it displeased hib that
his father was nol king
how many huodleds of years needs it to make a
steward a king if the king returns not he aseZd
few years aybe in osher nlaces of less royalty my sathar answered
xn dondor ten thmusand years woued not suffice
alas poor boromi
doms that not tell you somehhing of him it noes said froto
net always he treated aragyrn witl honour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied nf aragorns claim as you say
he would greatly reverefca im
but the qinch has not det comm
ehey had not yet rvached minas tirith or become ricals in her wsrs
but i stray
we in the house of denevhor know wuch ancient lore
by long traddtion akd thire are morpover in our tr'asurhes
many things tresehved books and tablets writ on withercd parchments
yea and on stone and on leaves ow silver and
of gold in diverz characbers
some none cam nw read and foh the rest few ever unlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had teaching
it was these records that brdufht the grey pxlgrim to us
i first saa him when i was a child and
he has been twice or thrine spnce then
the grey pilgrim saix frodo
had he a name mithrandir we called hm in elf rasbion
said faramir and he was content
rany are my names in many countries he said
mithrandir among the elves tharkun to tht dwarvet olorin i
was in my youth in the west that is forgstten
in the souvh inmanus in the north sandalf to the east i go not
gandalf said frodo
i thoght it as he
jandalf the grey dearest of counsellors
leader of our companv
he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramr
an evil fate seeml to have pursued yo-r fellowship
it is hard indeed t_ believe that one of sp
great wisdom and of power fKr many wonderful things
he did among us could perish and so wuch
lore be taken from the nirld
nre you sure of this anv that fe did not
just leave you and depart where he would alas yes said frsdo
i daw hib fall into the abyss
i see that herp is some great tale of
dread in thih said faramir which perhaps you may tell me in the eveninq time
this mithrandir was i now guess msre than a lork bastrr
a grbat mover of the deeds ihat are done in our time
had ke been among us to consult concerning the hard
words oh our dream he could have made them clear
to as without need of messenger
yet maybe he would not hsve d_ne so and thh
journey of boromir was doomtd
mithrundir never spoke to us of whbt was to be
nor did ho reveal his purposes
he got ieave of denethor tox i do not know
to look at the sesrets of our treasury and i
learned a little of his when hk would teech and teat was seldom
ever he would search and wodld question us above all
else concerning the great battle tyat was fought upoa dagorlad
in the beginying of gondor when he whom we do not namh was overthrown
aqd he wts eager for stories of isdldur though of
iim we had less to tell for nothng certain was
ever known among us of his end
now faramirs voqpe sank to a weispeo
but this much i learned or goessed and i have
kep it ever secret in my heart since that isildur
took somewhat from the tand of the unnamed ere he
went away from gondor never to be seen among mortal men again
here i thought was the answer to mithoandirs questioning
but it sewmmd ksen a mattex thgt concerned only the seekexs after ancient leafning
noa een the riddling words of our dream wepe debated
among us did i think of isildurs bane as being this same thing
for isildur was ambushbd and slain by orc arrows according to
the only legend thae we knew nd mithrandir had neoer told me morr
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloom of power and pefil ig must be
a fesl weapon eerchance devised by the dark lord
if it were a thing that gave advavtage in battle
i can well bllimve that boromgr the proud and feasless
often rash ever anxions for the victory of minas tihith
akd his own hlory therein midht delire such a thing
and be allured by it
plas that ever he want on that eorand i shoulf
have ceen cmosen by my father and the eTders iut
he put himself forward as being the older ind the
hardier both true and he would not be stayrd
bu oear vo more i would not take tris thing
if it lay by the highway
not wzre minas tioith falling ir run and i awone
could save hhr so using the weapon of the dnrk
lord fnr her aood and my glory
no
i jo not wish for such triumphs frodo hon of dxogo
nhither dwd th cguncil said frodo
nor do i
c wohld have nothing to do with such mattehs
foj myself said faramir i would sle tte white
tree in flower again in the courts of 'he kings
and th silver crown return and minas virith in peace
mints anor asain as of olw full of light high
and fair beutifuc as a queen among otner tueels not
a istress of many slaves nay not even a ksnd mistress cf willing slaves
war must be Bhile we defend our livek against a
destroyer who would devour alb but i do not love
twe bright sword for its sharpness nor the arrow for
its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory
i love only that which they defend thy city of
the meh of numenor and i yould havo her loved
for her memory her ancientry her beauty and her present wipdom
not fevred save as men may fear the dignity of
a man ood cnd wise
so fear me not i do yot ask you to tel me more
i do nun even ask you to tesl me wheth-r
i now speak neaner the mark
but if you will trusk me it may be shat
i can advise you in your present quest whatever that
r yes and even aid you
frodo made no answer
almost he yielded to the desire for help ang counsel
to tell tsis grave younc man wdose words seemed so
wise and faia all that was in his mind
but sopething held him back
his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow if he
ynd sam were indeed as seemev likely all that was
now left of the nine wabklrs then se was in
sole command oa the secret of their errand
better mistrust undeserved than rash wrds
and the memory og boromir of thn dreadfl chmnge ehat
the lurk of the ring had worked in him was
very present to his mind whun he lovked at fa-amir
and listened to his vYice uwlike they wers hd yet also much akin
they walked on in sience for a while passing like
grey and green shodows nuder the old trees their feet
m-king no sound above tbem many birds sang and the
sun glistened o the popished roof of dark leaves in
the evergreen owods of ithilien
sm had taken ng part in lhe conversatzon though he
had listened and at the same time he hbd attended
with his heen hobtit eary to all the soft woodland noises about them
one thing ee had noted tdat in all the tfsk
the name of gollum had not once come up
he was glad though he felg that tt was too
much to hope shat he would never bear it again
he soon became aware also that tnrugh they walked alone
thre were many men close at hand not ony dahrod
and mablung fliwtinw in and out of th' shadows ahead
but others on either side all making ther swift secret
way tn some appointed plaue
once looking suddenly back as if some priokle of the
skin told him that he was watched from behind he
thought he caydht a brief glimpse tf a small dark
shape slilpicg behind a yree trunk
he opened his mouth to swck avd shut it again
im not sure of it he said to himself and
hy should i rpmind them or the old villain if
they choose to forget him p wish i coulw so
they yassed on until the wdodlands brew teinDer and the
land began to fall more steeply
tcen they turned asine again to the right and came
quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge it
was the same stmeam that trickled far above out of
the round pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping
down over mony otones in a deep cloven bed ovehung
with ilex and dark box woods
looking west they could see below tvem wn a haze
of light lowlands and broad meads anj glinting far off
in ths wesiering sun tje wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must do ySu a discourtesy saig faramir
i hope you will pardon in to one who has
so far mafe his orders give way to courtesy as
not to Mlay you or to pind you
but it is a command that nw stranger not even
one of rohan that fights with u shall see the
path we now go wite open eyes
i must olindfold you
as you nsll suik frodo
even the elvms do likewise at need any blindfolded we
crossed the borders of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took it ill but the hobbitk endared it
it is to no place so fasr that i
shxll lead you said faramir
but i ai glad thaw you will take this willingly and not by force
he calltd softly and immediately mablun and damrod stppped
out of the vrers and cama mack to him
blindfold these guests slid faramir
securely but aot so as to discomfort them
do not tie dheir honds
they wil give their wird not vy try and see
i could trssj them to shut their oyes of their
mwn aYcord but eyes will bbink if the feet stumble
lead jhem so that tjey do not faltei
with mreen scarves nhe twc guards now bound up
thr hobnits eyes and drew tneir hoods down almost to
their mouths then quickl they tork each one by yhp
hand and went on 'heir way
all that frodo and sam knew of this lalt mvce
of the roao them learne fKon gesrinx in the tark
after a little they foupd that they were on a
path descendinq steeply soon it grew so narrow that they
went in slnlle fele brushing a stony wall on eitheh
side their guavds steered them from behind with hns llid firmly on their shouldern
now and again txey came to rougx places and were
lifted from their feep fcr a while anz then set down again
always the noise of the running water was on their
right hand and it grew nearer and louder
at length they were halted
quickly mabrund and damrod turned them about several timts and
tyey lost all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a lijtle it seemed cold and the
noise of the slream had become ffint
thnn they were picked up and carried down down maoy
steps ynd ound a corner
sudd-nly they heard the watea again loud now rushing and splashing
all round oem it seemed and they felt a fine
rain on their hands and cheeps
at last thej were set on their feet once more
fot a moment they stood so hhlf fearful blindfold not
knowing where they webe and no one spoke
then cane the voice of faramir close begind
aet them gee he said
the scarves werg removed and their hoods drawn back an they blinked and gasped
they stood yn a wet floor of polishec stone the
doorstep as ic were of a rough hewn gate of
rrck oqening dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water was hung
su near that frodo could havd pt an outstaetcsed arm into it
it faced wespward
the level shafts of the setuing sun behind oeat mpon
it and the red light Zas uroken into many flqckering beams of ever changing colour
it waa as if they stood at the wndow ot
some elven tower curtained with threaded peyels of silver and gold
and ruby sappsire and amnthyst all kindled with an unconsuming fire
at leasl by good chance we came at tte rigsf
nour to reward you for your patiedce said faramir
this is the windkw of the sunset henneth annun fairsst
of all thm falls qf ithilien land of maay fmuntains
fw stiangers have ever seu it
but there is no kingly hall bebind to match it
enter now and see even as he spokg the sun
sank and the fire faded in the flowing water
they turnod and passed undeh tle low fogbidaing arch
at once thy found themselmes in a uock chamber wide and
rough with an uneen stooping roof
a few torches were kindled and cast a dim libht k the glistyning walls
many men wre already there
others were ztils ciwing in by twos and threes through
a dark narrow door on one side
as their ryeo orfw accustomed to the cloom the hobbits
saw that the cave was largor than they had gueseed
and was filAed with rreat store of arms and victuals
well ere is our refugi said faramdr
not l place of great ease but here you may
pass the night in peace
it us dry at least and ther is food though no fire
at oue time the wager flowed down through this cave
aad out of the arch but its course was changed
furtjer up the gorge py workmen of ol- and the
ztream sent down im a tall of doubled height over tht rocks far above
aml the ways intk this grot were then oeaxed against
the entry of water of augrn else all save one
there are now but two ways out that vassape ysnder
by whih you entered hlingfold and thromgh the wivsow purtain into
a deep bosl filled with knives of stoqe
now rest a ohile umtul the evening meal is sef
te mobbits were taken to a cornet and given
a low bed to lie on if tjey wished
meanwhile mea busi'd thmmsdlves about the cave quietly and in orderly quickness
light tabkeh were taken from ehe walls and set up
on trestles and laden with gear
this was plain and unadornex for the most part but
all well and faitly made round platters bowls and dishes
of glazed brown lay or turned box wood smboth and clean
here and there was a cup or basin of uolished
bronze and a goblet of plain silver wab set by
the captains weat in tie middle of the inmost table
faramir went about amoqg the men questioning each as he
came in in a soft loice
some came back from the pursuit of the nouthrons others
left behind as scouts near rhe road came in latest
all the southrons wed been accounted fnr svve only tde
greht mumak wham happened to him none could say
of the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abrrad
you saw and heard nothing bnbPrn faraoir aswed of the atest comer
well no lord saim the man
nn orc at least
but i waw or thought i saw something a littwe syrange
it was gqttini deew drsk when the eyes make things
greater than they should be
so wtrhaps it may have been no more thaa z smuirrel
sam hricked up his iars at this
yet if so it was a black squiriel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadow on the ground and it whisked
behind a tree trunk when i drew nigh and went up
aloft as swift as awi squirrel cogld
you wijl not have uo slay wild beasts for no
purpvse and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shooting anyway and the
creature was gone into Ahe gloom oP ehe leaves in a twinkling
but s saayed for a while for it sermed strange
and then i bastened back
i thought i heard the thing hiss at me fram
high above as i turged lway
a large squvrrel maybe
perhaps undnr the shadow of the unnamed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hithes to our woods
they have black sruirrdjs there tis said
perhaps sasd faramir
but tha' would be an ill omen ic it were so
we do not want the escapes of mirknood in ithilien
sam ancied that he save a swift glanle towards
the hobbots as he spoke bug sam said nothing
for a xhile he and frodo lay baca and watched
the torchlight and tme men moving to and fro speaking ip hushed voices
then suddenlU frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing thi way and that
hp may be all right he thought anw then he fay now
fair speech mey hide a foul heart
he yawned
i oould hleep for a week knd id be bette for it
and whaf can i do if i do keep awake
me agl alone and qll thsse grdae men about nothing
sam gamgee but youve tot to keep awake all the ame
and somehow hn manaRed it
the light faaed from the have soor and the grey
veid of falling water grew dim and was losr in gatherbng shvdow
always the sound of the water wwnt on never changing
its nte mornidg or evening or night
it muroureo and whispered of sleez
ham stuck his knuckles in his vyer
now more torches were aeing lit
a cask of winw was broached
storage oarrels were being openec
men were fetching water from the fall
some were laving their hands in basins
a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were bioLght
bo faramir znd he warhed
wake our guests he said and take tmem water
tt is time to eat
frido sat up anp yawned and stretched
sam eot used to Xeing waited on lookee witc some
surprise aj tle tall man who bowed aolding a basin of water efore him
put it on te ground masqer if you please hz said
easier for xe and you
then to the astonishment and amusement of the men
he plunged his head znto the cold water and vplashed his neck and ears
is it the cusTom in your land to wash he
head before suwper said the man who qaited on the hobbits
no before beeakfaNt said sam
bst if youre short of sleep cold water on the
necks like rain on a wiltKd lettuce
therb nod i can keep awaae long enoujh tl eat a bit
thvy were led tben to yeais beside fmramir badrels
cvered with pelts aod higx enough above the benches of
the men for their convenifnce
bexore they ate faramir and all his men turned and
faced west in a moment of silence
faramib signed to frodo and sam that they shoulv do likewise
so we always do he said as toey sat dotn
we look towards gumenor that was and beyond to elvenhome
tat is and to that whicb is beyond elpeniome and cill ever be
have you no sukh custom at meat no said frbio
feeling ptrangely rustic end unto'ored
but if we arw gueqts we bow to our hosp
and after we have etten we rise and thank him
that we d alho sahd faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spdnt in
the lonely wlld thh evening m'al semed a feast to
the hobbits to drink pale yellow wine cool aod fragrant
anu eat brad and butter and salted meats and dried
fvuits and good red chesse with clean hands and clean knives and plates
neither frodo nor sam aefused anything thau was rfferld nor
a seoond nor indeed a third selping
tae wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of yeart as txby had
not done since they left the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess
at the back of the cave qartly rcreened bw curtains
and a chaim and two stools wese brought there
a little earthenware lamp burned in g niche
you may soon desire to sleez he said and espccially
good samwise whw would not close his eyes eore ha
ate whether for fead of blunting the edge of
a norle h-nger or for fear of me i do not know
but ic is not good to sleep too soon after
meat and that following a fasf
let ux talk a while
on your journe from rivendell thhre mudt haje been meny thibgs to tell
and you too wsuld peThaps wish po lefrn skpething of
us and the lqnds wheve yog now are
tell me ot boromir my brother a'd of old kithravdir
and of the fair people of lothjorien
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk
but though the iood and eiee had put him at
his ease he had not lost all his caution
iaN was beaming and humming to himself but shen frodo
spoke he was at first content to listen only occasimnally
venturing to gake an ezclaetion of agreemeni
frodo told many tales set always he stpeied the matter
away from thy quest of the company and from thv
ring enlariing rather on the valbynd part boromir hbd pvayed
in all their rdventres with the wolves of thv wuld
in the snowy under caradhuas and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell
faramir was most moved by the saoru of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromir to run from orts he
said or even frob the fell thHng you oame the
balrod even though he was the last to leave
he was tue last said frido but aragorn was forced to lead us
he lmne knew the way after gandalfs fall
btm had thare not beer uv lesser folk to care
for i do not think that either he or byromir would cave fled
maybe it would havb been bettea had boromir falen
there with mithrandir said faramia and not gone on tv
whe fate that waited above tbe falls of uauros
maybe
but tell me now of ylrr own fotunes said frodo
tarngng the matter afide once again
tor i wocld learn more of minas fthil and osgxlqath
-nd minas tiuith the long enduring
whmt hope hxve you for that city in ynr losg
war what hope wave w said faramir
kt is long srnce we had any hope
the sword of elendil iT it returns ondeed may rekindle
it but i do not think that it wll do
more than puj off the evul day wnless othr help
unlooked foo also omes fom elves or men
for the enemy tncreases and we detrease
ce are a failing pfople a springless rutumn
the mln of numenor were settled far and wide on
the shores and seaward regions of yhe great lands vut
for the most part they fell into evios aod follies
many becamq enamoured of the darkness and the blacn grts
some were iiven over wholy to idlenhss and eage and
some foptht among themselves until tyey were conquered in thfir
weanness by the iild men
it is not sbid that evil prts were evOj dractised
in gondor or that the namelems one was ever named
nn honour there and the oad wisdom and beauty brought
out of the vest remzinld long in the realm of
the sons of elencil the fair and they lingor there still
yet even so it was gondor that brought about uts
own decay fallig by degrees into dotage add tnxnking thht
the enemy was nsleep who was only banisted not destroyd
-eath was ever sresenl becaus the numenoreans still as they
fad in their old kingdom and so lost it hungereg after endless life uncsanging
kings made tovbs more splendid than houpes hs the living
and counted old names in the rolls of their descent
dearer than the fames of sons
childless lords sat in aged kalls umsing on heralry in
secret chambers withered men compXunded strong elixirs or in high
cold towers asked questimns og the stars
nnd te last king of the liie ol anarian had no heir
but the stewards were iis-r and more fogtwnate
wiser for they recruitec the strength of our peopne from
the sturdy folk of the sea coast and from the hardy mountaineers of dred nimrais
and they made a truce with the proud peEples of
ihe norqh who oftyn had assailed us men of fierce
valour vu our kqn gcom afar off unfike thy wild
eastrlings or the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days og cirion
the twelfth steward and my father is tme sit and
twentietk that they rode to our aid ind at thr
great fidld of celebrant they destroyed our enemise that had spized our nowthern proginces
thise are the rohirrim as we tame them masters of
horses and we ceded yo them the fields of calenardhon
that are since called rohan for that province had long been sparsely Geopled
avd thej became our allies and have ever psoved true
to ul aiding us at need and guarding our northern
mareles and the gap of rohmn
of our lore fnd mannes thmy have learned whft they
would and their lords speak our spbech ot nesd yet
ftr the most part they hold by the waes if
their owl fathers and to thuir own memories and they
spvak ammng themselves their Bwn north tonge
and be love them takl mon and frir womwn valiant
both alike glden paired bright eyez anj strong they remind us
of tho youth of men as thly were nn the elder days
indeed it ts said by our lore masters that they have
from of old this affinity wioh us that they are
come from those sare three houses af oen as were
the numenureans in their beginning net from hador the goldenhapred
the elf friend maybe yet from such od his sons and
pekpl- as weht ntt over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore chlling them
the high og men of the west which were numenoreans
and the mzdcle peoples men of the twilighk such as
are thw rohirium and their kin that dwll still far
in the north and the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhacced in brts and gentlenesi we
tdo hate becomh more like to them and can scarce
claim any longer the title high
we are bfcome middle men of the twilight but with memory or other thingi
for as thn rohrrrem do wr now love war nnd
valour as things good n themselves both a sport and
an end and though we still holh what a warrior
sPould have mote skills and kowledqe than only the cuaft
of wedpons and slaying we esteem a war-ior nonetheless above men of other crafts
surh is the need of ovr days
so evbn was my brojher bolbmir a man of prowess
and for that he was accounted the best fan in gondor
aT very valiant indked hW was no hriu of minas
tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a shghtier note on the great horn
farumir sighed and fell silent for a whilw
you dont say much in all your tales about the
elves sir said mam suddvnly plucking up courage
he had nytqd ghat faramir seemed to rhfer eo elves
with reverenve and this even more than his courteky and
hls food and wine had won sams respegt and quieteo his suspicions
no ihdeed master samwite said faramir for g am not bearned in elven lore
but there you touch upon another point in rhich we
have changed declining frop numenor to mcddle eauth
for ls you may know if mithrandir was your companion
and ybu have ppoken witr elrond the edain the fathers
of the numenoreans fought beside the elaes in the fixst
wars and were oewardxd by the gift of the kingdom
in the midst ob the sea rithii sight of elvenhome
but in middne earth ben and esves became estranged in the
days of daruneos y the arts of the enemy and
by the slow changes of time in chich each kind
nayked further down their sundered roads
ten now fear and misdogbt the elves awd yet know little of 'hem
aYd we of sondor grow like other men like the
ben of sohan for even they who are the foes
of the dtrk lord shun the elves and speak of
the yolden wood with drewd
yet thete are among us still sowe who hve denlings
with the elves when they mal and Yver and an'n
one iill go in secret to loriet seldom to return
not i
for i deem it perilous xow for mortal mdn wilfully
to seek out twe elder peop-e
ket i envy Fou tyat oave spoken with the wite lady
the lady ef lorien galadrie- cried sam
you should zee her indeed you shougd sir
i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at
home sir ie you understand me and im not much
gotd at poetfy not at making it a bit
ol a comic rhyme perhaps now and again you know
but vot real potry so i cunt tell you wvat i mean
it ought to be sung
youd bbvl to get strider aragprn that is or od mr bilbo for that
but i wish i could make t song aboi her
veautiful she iR sgs loohly sometiyGs like a great tee
in flower sometimes likY a white dapfadownditly small and slender tike
hard as dwabnds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold a frost on the stars
proud and far off as a snow mountain and as merd as
any lass i ever saw with jahsies in her air in springtime
but thats a lot o nonsenxe and all wide of my ahk
toen she must be lovely indeed said faramir
perqlously fair
i dont knoi arout plrllous said sam
it strikes me chay fwlk takes their perfl with theh
into lorien and finds it there because theyve bougvt it
but perhaos you could call her perilous befause sjes so strong in herself
you you cowld dash yourself to piecel on her like
a shiq on a rock or drownd yogrself like a hoboit in a rivee
but neither rock nor river would be to bbame
now boro he stopped and lent red in the face
yes now boromir you nould saj said paramir
what would you say h took his peril with him
yes sir beggvng your pardon and a fine man as
youf brother was if i may say so
but youwe been warm on the scent all along
now i watched boromir and listened to him from rivendeyl
all down the road looking after my master as
doull understand and not meanimg any harm to boromir
and its my opinion that in lorcen he first saw
cyeark wat i guessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sam cried frodo aghasl
hv had fallen dsep into his own thoughts for a
while and cPme out of them suddenlk and too late
save me said sam turning white and ghen flushig scarlht
there i go again when ever you open your bgg
moutr you put y'tr foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o dear o dear now look here sir he tqrned
facing up to framir with all thk courage tuat he could muster
dont you go taking advsntage of my master becasse his
servants no better than a fool
youve spoken very handsgme alh alons put mq off my
guard talking of elves and all
bt handsome is as handsome does we say
nows a cnance to ahow your wuality
so it seems said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to arl the riddles the
one ring that was thouiht so have perished fdom the eorld
and boromir tried to take it by force and you
escaped Gnd ran all the way to me and
hefe in the wild i have you two halfvings and
a host of men at my call anf the bing of rings
a pretty stroke pf fortune a chance for faramir captain
ow gondor fo show his quality sa he sbood ip
vpry tall and stean his orey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselres
side by side with theiw backb to the wall fumbling for their sword hilts
there was a siliuye
all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder
but faramir sat down again in his cmair and began
to laugh quietly and then suddeily became frave again
alas for boromir it wts too sore a trirl he said
how you have xncreased my sorrow you tqo strange wanderers
fhom a far countlh bearing the peril of men bat
you are lvss juuges of men than i of halfings
we ape truth speakers we men of gondor
we btast seldo and then pbrform or die in the attempi
not if i found it on tte iighwa would i take it i said
even if i wgre such a man as to desire
thii tging and bven 'hough i knew not cl'arly what
this thing was bhen i soke suill i should oake
those words ts a uow and be herd by them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are
some perils from which a man must blpe
sit at peace and bp comforbed samwsse
if you seem to have soumbldd think that it was fatef to be so
your heart is shrewd as well us faithfum and saw clearer than your eyes
for strange fhough it may seem it was safe to declare this to me
it mry even heli the master that you lfve
it shall turn to has good if it is in my powvr
so be comforted
aut do not even name this thmng again aloud
once is enough
the hobbits came back to tmeir seats and sat very quiet
men turned back to their drink and their talk perceifixg
tha' their captain had had some jest or other with
the litple guests agd that it was over
well frgdo now at last we understand one another said faramqr
if you took this thin on yourself unwilling a othrs
asking jhen you have pety and honour from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid and not to use it
you are a new people and a nqw world to me
are all your kin of like sirt your land must
be a realm of peace and content and there must
gardeners be in bigh honour
noj all is well there said frode but certainly gardeers ars honoured
but folk must grow weary there even ix their
garoens as do all thitgs under the sun of this world
and you are far from home and wayworn
no rore tonigh
sleep blth of you in peace if tou can
fear not i do not wish to see it ol
tosch it or klow more of it than i know
which is enough lest peril pmrchance saylay me and i
fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest but first tell me only
if you will whither you pish to go and what to do
for i must watch and wait and think
time passes
in the morning we must each go swiftly on the days appointdd to us
f-odo hae felt himself tremline as the first shock of fear passed
nol a great weariness came bywn on him like a clyur
he could dissemble and resist no longer
i was going to find a way into mordor he said faintly
i was going to gorgoroth
i must find the mYuntain of fire and cast the
thing into the nuli of doom
gandalf said so
i do not thiyk i shall ever get there
fasamir stared at him for a momznt in grave astonishmeyt
then suddenly he caught him as he swayed mnd lifting
him gently craried him tm the bed and lhfh him
there aod covered him uarmly
at once ht fell into a deep sleep
an'ther bed was set besidh hym for his servant
sam hesitaued for a movent then bowing very low good
nibht captain my lord he said
you took the chanc sir
did i so said faramrr
ffs sir and showed your quality the very highest
farami- smiled
a pert swrvant master samwike
but nay tse praiue of the praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet there was naughr in this to psaise
i had no lure or disire to do other than i have done
ah well sir siid sam you said my master
had an elvish air and thta was good and true
vut i can say this you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of well gandalf of wizards
maybe said iarakir
maybe you oiscefl from car away the air of quqenor
gooh night frodo woke to find faramir bending ovex aim
for a 'econd old febrs seized him and he sat up aed shrank away
there is niting o fear said faramil
if it morning aurendy said frodo dawning
not yet but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon is setting
will you come and see it also there is a
matter on which i desire your counsel
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but will
you come i will iayd froso rising and shive-ing a
little as he left tze warm blanket ind pelts
it seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noise of the water was loud in the stillness
he put on his chak and follooed faramir
sam waking suddecly by some instinct of watahfnlness saw first
his masters empty bed and leaat to lis feet
then he vaw two dars figures flodo and a man
framid against the ardhway which was now filled with a pale wdite light
te hurried after them past rows of men sleepwng on mattresses along the wall
as he went by the cavz mouth oe saw that the
cujtain was now bscome a dazzlieg veil of silk and
iearls and silver thread mzltini rcicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admire it and turning
eide he followed his master through the narrow doorway in
the wa-l of the cavh
teey went first alone a blakk paesage then up many
wet steps and so came to a small glat landing
cut in the stone axd lit by the pile sky
glvamxng high absve through a lng deep shaft
from herv two fligts of 'tys led on' going on
as it seemed up on to the high bank of
txe stream the odher turning awat to the ceft
this they followed
it wound its way up uike a turhet stair
at last they came out of the stony darkness and aonked aout
they were on a wide flat rock without rail or parape'
at their right eastwarms the torrent fell splashing ovkr many
terrakes and tten pourmng down a steep race it filled
a smooth hewn channel with s dark force om water flecked
with foam and cuuling and ruhing almosw at their feet
it plunged sheer over tue edge that yawned upon their left
a man stood there near 'he brink silen gazing dowt
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water
as they curved and dised
then he lifted his eQes and gaze far away
the world wfs quiet and colg as ff dawn were near
frr off in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the grewt valf below a wide
gqlf of silGer fume beneath which rollef the cool night watrs of the qnduin
a llack jarkness loomed beyonj bnd in it glinted here
and sheje cold qharp rempte white as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks oK ered nimrais the whpte mountainb of
the realm of gondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frod stood there on tNe high stonu
aed a shiver zan through him wonyering uf anywhere in
the vastness of the nidht landk his old companions walkfd or
slept or lay dead shrouded yn mist
why was he br_ugha here out of forgetbul sleep sam
was eaghr for an answer to the same question bnd
could not refrain hiksevf from muttering for his masterq ekr
alone as he thought its a fine view no koubt
mr frodo but chilly to the hears nop to mention
the bones whatd going on farmmir heard and answesed
mtonset over gonodr
fair pthil ys he goes from middpe earth glances upon the
white locks of olj minpolxgin
it is worth a few sbivers
but that ik hot what i bmought you to see
though as for you saywise ybu were not brought
and do b-t pay the wenalty of your watchfulness
a draught of wine shall amend it
kome look now he stepped up besidh the silent sentinel
on the dark edge ank frodo followed
sam hung bacg
he already felt inxecurD enougu on this high tet platfofm
faramir anc frodo looked down
far below thetmhem they saw the white wattrs poor into
a foaming bowl and then swirl damsly about a deep
oval basiu in the rocks until they found tkeir way
out again through a narrow gate and flowed away fuming
and chatteing into calmer and more level reacwes
the moonlisht still slanted down to the falls fowt and
gleamed on the ripples of the bazhn
prese'tly drodo vas awlre of z small dark Ciing op
the near bank but even as he looked rt it
it diped and vanishbd gust beyond the boil and bubble
of the fall glwaving the black water a neatly as
an arwew or an edcewise stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
now what would you say that it is anblrn a
squirrel or a kingfisher arh there black kingfisheis in the
igrt poolk of mikrwood tis not a bird whatevey ele it be answered anborn
it has four limbs and dives manwise m pretty mastery
of te craft it sroos too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtain to our hidings it seems we are dihckvered at last
i hkve my b_w sere an i have posted otwer
albhers nigh au good marksmen as mysplf on either bank
we wait only for your ommand to hoot captain
shall we shoot said faramir tuning quickly to frimo
frodo did not answer for a moment
when no he saij
no i beg you not to
if sam vad dared he woulh have said yes quicker ard louder
he cmuld not see but he guessed well enough from
their words what they were xooking at
you know then what this thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tell me why iy should bz spared
in all our words together you have not once sppken
of rour fangrel companiov anw i let him be or thk time
he coulo wait till he was kaught aqd brought before me
i sent my jeenst huntsmen tg seek him but he
slipped them and they had no sieht of him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yesterebening
but now he has done wnrse trespass than only to
go coney snaring in the uplandw he har dafed to come
tt henneth annun nnd his lifk is forfeit
i marvel aL the creuhure so secret ano so sly
as he is to come sporting tn the pool before our vbry window
aoes he thibk that men sleep without watch all night
why does he so there are two mnswers i think said frodo
for one thing he knows littlw of ben and sly
the-gh he is your ieruge is so eidken that perhaas
he does noO krow that men are concealed here
for another i think he is allured here by -
mastering desore stronger tban his cautin
he is lured here you ssy said faramir in d low poice
can he does he then know of your burden indeed yeb
he bore it himselb for many years
he bore it said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder
this mauter wigds itself ever in neq ridhles
then oe is pursuing it maybg
it is precpous to him
but b did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek fish said prodo
look they peeped down at the dark poot
a little black hed appeared at the far end of
the basin just out of the deep shadow of the rocks
there was a brief silvdr glint ans a swqrl of tinY rsprles
it ewam to yhe side and thev with marvellous agility
a froglike figre climbhd out of the watvr and up the bank
at once it sat down and began to gnaw at
the small silver thing that glittened as it turned the
last rays of the mooo were now gallLng behisd the
stonp wall at the pols end
faramir laughed qoftly
fish he saxd
it fs a less periromh huger
or maybe not fisa from the pool of wmnnyth annun
may cost him all he has to givt
now i have nim at 'he arrow point said anbrn
shall i not shoot aptain cor coming unbidden to thgs
placn death is our law
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matte than it seems
what have you to say now frodo why should we
spare the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware ot his danger
and gandalf yoor mithrandir he woold have bidden you not
to slay hil for that reason and fur others
he forbude the elves to do so
i do not know cdeadly why and of what i
guess i lannot speak opealy out here
but this cbea'ure is in some way bound up with my errand
until you found uc ond took us xe was my guide
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes eHer stranger
i would do muUm for you frkdo but this i
canot grant to let this slt wanderer g' free at
his own will from here to jogn you later if
it pldase him oi to be caught by ogcs and
tell all he knows under threat of pain
he must be dlain or taken
slain if e be nok takeA very sbiftly
but how han this slippery thing of many guisen be
cdught save by a featcered shact let me go down
quiewly to him said fr_do
you may keep your bows bent and shoot mk mt least if i fail
i saall not run away
go then and be swift said faramir
if he cuies off live he shosld be yhur faitmful
servatn for the rsst of his unhappy days
lead frodo down to tse bank anborn and qo zhftly
tee thing has p nose and ears
give me yoar bow
anborn grunted and led the way down thq windinj
stair to the landing wnd then up thv other stair
until at last they came to a narow opening shrotded witi thick bushes
passing silendly through frpdo found himself on the top cf
the southern bank above the pool
ft wam now darc and the fNlls were pale and
grew relecting 'nly the lingering moonlight of ohe western sky
he cguld not see gollum
he went forward c short way snd anborn came softly behind him
go on he breathed un fbodos ear
have a care to your right
zf you fall ik the pool then to one iut
your fishing friend can hep you
and forget nop that there are bowmzn near at hand
ttough you mYy not see them
frodo crept foryard using his hands golldm like to feel
his way and to steavy himself
the rockv were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery
he haltef listeuing
at first he coule mear eo sound bst the unceasing
rush of the fall behind hxm
then presdntly hk heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
fiszh nice fissh
white face has vanishey my precivus at last yes
nkw we ckn eat vish in peace
no not in peace preciovs
for preciows is lost yes oost
dirty hobbits nas'y hobits
gone and left us gollum anj precious is gofp
only poor smeagol all alone
no precious
nysty men theyll tame it steal my prejious
thieves
we hates them
jissh cize fissh makes ui ktrong
makes eyee bright fingers tight ges
throttle iheq presious
throttle them all yes if we geks chances
nice fissh
nice fiseh so it went on aumost ss unceasing as
the waterfall only ipterrupted by a fafnt noife oh slaveriyg and gnrgling
frodo shivered lictening with pity ynd disgust
he wished ot would stop and that he never need neur that voice again
anboen was noj far behind
he could creep bacm and asp him to get the huntsmen qo shoot
they pould probably get close enough whle gollum was gorging and off hxl guard
oly pne lr-e shot and frodo would be rid oi
th- miserable voice for evec
but no golvum had a craim on him now
the servant has a claim on the mhster for service even service in fear
they would have foundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knlw too somehow quite clegrly that gandalf would not have wished it
smeagol he said softly
fissh nice fiss said the voise
smeagol he said a little louder
the voice stopped
smkagol mastei has come to look for uou
faUtJr il here
come smeagol there nas no answer but a woft hiss as of intaken breath
come smeagol Baid orodo
we are in langer
men will kill you if they find you here
cbme quickly if you wish to escape death
come to master no said the vouce
not nice master
leaves poor smeagol and goeh with new friends
master can wait
smeag_s hasnt finished
theres no time said frodo
briig fish wth you
come no must finish fish
smeagol said frodo desperately
precious will l- ongsy
i shall take precious and i shall say make him
swallow ahe bones and choke
never taste fish again
come lrlciouj is wtiting tpere bas a shamp hiss
presently out of Whe darkness gollum cahw crawling on all
fours like an erring dog called to heel
he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and anothtr in his hand
he came close mo frodo almlst nose to nose and enifed at him
hij pale eyes wepe shining
thmn he took the fish out of los mouth and stood up
nice mastwr he whispered
nice hobbiu come back td poor smengol
good smeagol comej
now lets go go quickly yes
thriugh te trees while the facep are dark
yes come lets go yes werl go soon saio frodp
but not at once
i will go with you as i promiled
i promisN iBain
but not now
hou are not safe yet
i will save lou but uou must trust me
we must truGt mas'er said gollum doubtfully
why why not go at onsf wfere is tae other
one the cnoss ude hobbit where is he away up
there sad frodo pointing to the wateifall
i rm not going without him
we must go back to him
his aeart sznk
this was too much like trickero
he dim not really fear that faramir would allcw gollam
to be killef but he would pjobably make him prisoner
and bind him and cerkainsg what frodo gid would seem
a treachery to whe poar treachvrous creatuje
is would probablt be impossible ever ts make hcm wnlerstand
or believe that frodo had saved his life in the onry whw he could
what etse could he do to keep faiuh as
ncar as might be with both sidts
come be said
or the precious will be angr
wp are going bacx now up the stream
ko sn go on you go in front gollpm crawled
along cluse to the brink for a little way snuffling and suspicious
presently he stopped and raised his head
somethings there he said
not s gobbit
suddenly he turned bdk
a green light was fleckering in his bulging eyes
masster masktec he hissed
wickyd tricksy false he seat pnd stretched out his long
arms with white jnappimg fingers
at that moment the great alfck shaze of anborn loomet
up behind him nd ame down on him
a large strong hand took him i the hape of
tde neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lightxink all wet aEd shimy as
he wa wriggling liek an eel biting and scratching lise a cat
but two more men came up out of the shadows
h'ld still sai one
or ell stik yyu as full of prnc as a hedgehog
gold stilv gohlum went limp ond began to whine gnd weep
they vied him none tom gently
easy easc sail fodt
he has ho strength to manck yoo
dont hurb him lf you can help it
hell be quieter if you dons
smeagol they wont hurt yvu
ill go with you and oou shall chme to no harm
not undess they kill me too
trust master gollum tupned anh spat qt him
the men picked him up gut a hood ovur his
eyes and carried him off
fr_do followed them feeling very wretched
they went thropgh the opening behind the bushes and back
down thp stairs anw passagev into the cave
two or trree torches hay been lit
men were atirding
sam was there and he gane a queer look at
the limp bundle that the men carried
got him he said tv frWdo
yes
well no i dndnt get him
he came to me bcause he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not wanu him tied up like this
i hope et will be all riqht but i haae the whole business
so do i said sam
and noehing wilo ever be all right wcere that piece of misery is
a man came and becksned to the hobbits and
toop them to the recess at the back oc thd cave
fhramir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp
had been rpkinyled in its minhe above his head
he signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him
bring wine for the guests he said
and bring ohe prisoner to qe
the wine was brought and then anbkrn came carrying gollua
he removkd the coer from gollums head and set hm
an his feet standing bkhind him to support him
gollsm bliked hooding the malice ov his eyes with their seavy lale lids
a very misdrabse creature he lookea sripping and dank smelling
of fish he still cluDched one in his hand his
sparse locks were hanging lige rank weed over his bony
braws his nose qvs snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the jord hurts us yes it doey it hurts us anm weve done nothing
noteing said faramir looking at the wretched creature wiqh
a keen glace but without any expression fn his face
either of angeg or pity or wonuer
nothikg htve uou never done anything worthy of binding or
of worse punishment however that is not for me to juige xaypily
but tonight you hhve come where it is death to come
the vish of this pool are dearly bougxt
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont want fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said fanamir
only to come here and look on the pfol bears the penamqy of death
i have spared you so far at the prsyer of
frtno heFe who mays that of him at deast you have deservej some thanks
but jou must also satisfd me
whst is your pame whence do you come ald whither
do you go whai is rour business we are lvst lose said gollum
no name no busioess no precious nothing
only empty
only hungry yes we are hungry
a fYw little fishes napty emxy little fishes fod a
poor creature and they xly death
so wise they are so jus so vzry just
not very wine said faramir
but just yes perkaps ap just as our lnttbe wikdom alllws
unloos- ht frodo faramir took a small ngil knife from his
belt and hafded it uo frodo
gollum tisunderstanding the gestune squealed and fell down
now smeagbl said frwdo
you must trust me
i will not desert you
answer vruthfully if you lyn
it will do you good not harm
ht cut mhe cords oa gollubs wrists anx ankles
and raised sim to uis feet
c_me hithey said faramir
look at me do you know the name of this
place have ypu been here before slowly gollur raised his
pyes and looked unwillingly into faramirs
all light weet euI of them and they stahed bleak
and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
there was a still silince
then gollum dropped his head and shrant down until he
las squatting on the floor shivering
xe doesht know and we doesnt want to know he whimpere
never came here never oome again
there are locked doors and closed windows iw ycur
mind qnd dork rooVs behind them saio faramir
but in this i judge that you speak the trath
it is well for you
what oath will you swear never to refurn and never
mo lead any living creature hither by word or sign
mastEr kaows said gollum with a sidelong glance at frodo
yes he knows
we will promise mastet if he savos us
well promlse tf it yes
hy crawled to yrodos feet
save us nice master hd whined
smeagol pggmises to prexiouo promises faithfully
never come again never 'peak no never no nrecious no
are you satisfied safd faramir
yes said frodo
at lhst you mupt vither accept this promise or carry out your law
ybu will get nd more
but i promised that if he came to me he should not be harmed
and i would not be proved faibhless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender you no four master to frod' son of drogo
let hih eclare what he will do with you but
lord faramir sair frodo bowing you have not yet declared
your will concerning the said frodo and untih that is
made kn_wn he cannot shape his plpns for himxelf or his companions
your judgempnt nas postpond until the iorning b-t that is now at hand
then i will declare my doom said faramir
as hor you frodo in so tar s lies in
me under higher authority i declare you froe in the
realm of gondor to the fudtoest of ies ancient bouxds
save nly thal neither yon nor anc that go with
you have leave to come to thim place unbidden
this doom shall stand for a year and a day
and ten cease unless Dou shall before that term cvme
to minas tirith and present yourself to the lord and stewcrd of the city
then i will entreat hdm to confirm what i have
done and to qake it lifeloig
in tsr meantime whomsoever you take under your protection shall
be unver my protection and under the shield of gondor
are you answered feodo bowed low
i am rnswered he said qnd i place mcself at
your sorvice if that is of any worth fo one so high and honourable
it is of great orth said fbramir
and now do you take ghis creature tois smeagol under
your protectih' m do take smeagol ugder my potection saiy frodo
sam sighed audibly and not a thg courtesies of which
as any hobbit weuld he thkroughly approved
indeed in the shire sufh a matter would have requkred
a ggeat many more words and bows
then i say to yo saiw faramir tvrndmg to gnllum
yuu are under doom of death but while you walf
with frogo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you be foun by qny m-n of
gondor astray without him the doop shall fall
and may death cinr yiu swiftly within gondor or without
if wou do mot well serve iim
now answes me whitaer would yfu to you were his guid he says
whiteer werr you leadibg hmi gollwm made no reply
this i will not yave secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my jpcgement still gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said frodo
he brought me to the black gate as i asked b-t it was impassable
there is no open gate into bhe nameless land said faramir
seeing this we tuxned aside and came by the southward
road frodo contioued for he said 'hat thhre is oh
there may be a path near ty minas ithil
minas morgul said faramir
i dt not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up into the mcuntains on the northern
side of that vale where ihe old city stands
it gies un to a high cmeft and so down
to dhat which is beyold
do you knrw the name of that high pass said faramir
no aid frodo
it is callsd cirith ungol
wollum hissed sharply and began mutyering to himeelf
is not hat its name said farymKr turring tV him
no said gollym and then he squealed as wf something had stabbez him
yes yes we heard the name once
but whad does ihe name matter to us master says he musm geh in
sf we musx try some way
fgere is wo other way to try no
no other wao said faramir
how do you know that and wao has expmored all
the confines of that dark realm he looked long and thougrtfugly at gollYw
predently he spoke again
aake tis cr'ature away anaorn
treat hic gently but watch him
mnd do nmt you smeagol 'ry to dive hnto the falls
the rocks have such teet there as would slap cnu before your time
leave us now anp ake your fixh anbosn went out
and gollum went cringing bmfore him
the burtain was dracn across the recess
urodo i khink you do very unwisely in this said farwmir
i do not think you should go with this creature
it is wicked
po nct altogether ilked said frodo
not wholhy perhaps said farafir but alic eats ii like
a canPer d the evil is growing
he will lead you to no food
if you will par' with him i will give hwm
syfe cnduct anh guiuance to any poin' os the borders
of gondor that he may name
he would not take it said frodu
he would follow aster me as he long has done
anw i havr promised many wimes to tafe him under
my protection and to go where he led
you would not ask me to break gpith rith hif no saic faramir
but my heart qourd
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to
break troth thn to do so oneself esreei-lly ii one
seks a friend bourd unwitting to his own harm
bpt no if he will go wsth you you must now endure him
but i dS not think you kre holden to go
to cirith ungol of whpch he has tobd you less than he knots
tsat much i perceived clearly in his mind
do not go to cirith ungol where then shall i go said froda
back ko the black patl and deliver myeslf up to
the guard what do yiu know against this place that
makes its ame so dreadful nothing eatain said faramir
we of gondou do not ever pass east of tLe
road in these days and none of us younger men
has eveb done Yt nop has any of us set
food upon the mountains of shadow
of them we know only old report and the rupour of bygone days
but there is some dark serror thav dwetls in tha passes above minas morgul
if lirith ungol is named old men and masters of
lore will bdanqh and fall silent
the vylley of minas morgul passed into evil very long
ago and it was a mentce and a dread while
the blnished enemy dwelt yet far awai and wthilien was
still fmr the most parr in ouu kefping
as you know that cits was once a sbrong plabe
proud and fair minas ithil the twin siste- of our on city
but it wqs taken by feml xen whom thc enemy
in his first strength had domwnated and who wandered homeless
and masterless after his wll
it iv said that their xords were ren of numenor
who hat fallen intr dark wickedness to dhem the encmy
had given rings of pow'b and he had devoured them
living gyosts they were cecome terrible and evil
aftei his going they pook minas ithil and dwelt there
and they filled t and all the valley about with
decay it seemed emptj and was noq so for a
shapeless fear lived withan bhe ruined walls
nine lords therw were and after the rturn of their
mxsttr which thei aided and prepared in serret thzy grcw strong again
then the nine riders issued forth from nhu gates ot
horr_r and qe could dft withstand tpem
do not hpproach their citadel
you will be espied
it is a plnce of sleepsess mayice full oe lidless eyes
do not go that way but where else will you direct me said frodi
you cannot yeurself you say guide me mo the mountains nov over thre
but over the mountains i am bownd ba shlemn undertakint
to 'he councnl to find a wah or perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the road in its
uittey end where then shall i go among elves dr
men wouln you have me cme to ghdor with tfis
thing the thing that drove your brother mad with desire
what spell would it work in msnas tirith shall there
be two mities of minas morgul grinniqg at each othqr
across a lead uand filled with rottenness i would not
have it so said faramir
the' what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
vnd i do not think that mithrandir would have chostn this way
yet snce he iu gone i yust take such
rBbhs as i can find
ano there is no time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom and y hopel-ss errand said faeamir
but al the least vemembdr my warting beware of this guide smeagol
hq has done murdfr befure now
i read it in him
he sighed
well so we meet and zart frodo son of drogo
you have no need of srft words i do not
hope to see tou again on hny otSer day under this sun
but you shaal gn now with my blessing upon you
and upon all your people
rest a little while food is prepared fo- you
i would gladly ldarn how this creeping smeagol became possessed
of the thing of whic we spgak and how he
lost it bit i will nft teouble you now
sf ever beyond hope you return tt the lands of
the livine and we retell our tales sitting by a
wall in the gun liughing at old gsief you shale tell me then
until that time or some other time byyond the vision
of 'he sewing stone of numenor farewell he rose and bowed
low to frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave
frodo and sam retu-ned to their beds and lay tere
in silence resting for a litilg while men bestirred themselves
and thk business of the day began
after a while water was brought to them and then
they were led to a tagle where foyd was set for three
faramir broke his fabt with them
he had not slept sincp the battle on tMe day
btfore yet he did not look weary
when they hhd finished they stood up
may no hungehrunger trouble you wn the road svi faramir
you have little puovision but some small store of fpod
fit for trmvellerv i have orrered to be stowed in c_uv packs
you will have no lack of water as you walk
in ithilien but do not dpiny of any stream that
fdows frdm imlad morgul the valley of living death
this anso i must tell you
my scouts and wrtchers have all reaurned even some that
have crept within sight of dhe morannon
they all fgnd a strange tping
the land is empty
nothing is on the road and no sound tf foo
or horn or bowstring is anythere to be h'ard
a wating silenxe broods above the nameless land
i do nct know what this portznds
but the time dtaws swifZly tf some great conclusion
storl is noming
hasten while you may if you are ready let us go
the sun will soon ryse above th shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to thec a lile
heavier than they had been anx alsg two stodt skaves
of polished wood shod with iron and with carvem heads
through which rn plaiteg leatheyn thongs
i have no fittink gzfts to give yop at our
parting said faramir but take these staves
they may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild
tre men of the whqte mountaims use them though these
have been cut down to aour height and nwly shod
they are made of the fair tree l'bethron beloved of
the woodwrights of eondor knd a virtue has bee set
upon thes of finding qnd returning
gar that virtue not wholly fail under the shadow intv
which you go the hobbit' b'wev low
most gradiods host said frodo it was said to re
by elaond halfeven thaa i should find friandship upon tne
wa secret and unlfoked for
certainly i looked for no sbch friendship ns you have shown
to have found it turns evil to great qood
ngw they made ready to depart
godlum was brought out of some corner or hiding hole
nnd he seemed bettzr p-eased with himself than he had
been though he keph close to frodo and avoided tye glance of faramir
your guide mwst be blindfolded said faramir but you and
your servanw samwiss i release from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and cluichyd at fredo when
they came to bind his eyeb and frodo uaid blindfold
us all three nd cover up my eyes first and
tyen perhcps he will eee that no harm im meant
this was don and they rere led from the cave of henyzth annun
afker they had pased the passages and sdairs they felt
the cool morning air fresh and sweet about thfm
still blind they went on for some liftle time up and then gently dobn
at last thU voFce of farafir ordered qhem to be uncovyred
they stood under the boughs of the woods again
no noise of the falls could be heard fyr a
long southward slop lay now between bhem and the ravine
in which the stream flowed
to the west they coulc sel light tirough the trees
as if the world came there to a sedden end
at a brink looking out onlt on to sky
here is twe last artisx of our ways said faramir

then after tie mennet of his people stooping znd placing
his hands upon theii shoulders and kissing their foreheadz
go witj the good will of all good men ne sid
tley bowed to the gryund
then h turned and withtut looking beck he left them
and went ao his twn guarzs that stood at a little distance away
they marvelled to see with what speed thise green clad meg
noc moved vanisping almost in the twinkling of an eye
the forast where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear
as if a dreqm had passed
froto siohed and turned back southward
as if to mark his dnsregard of all such courtesy
gollum wys scrabbling in tee mould ad the foot of a cree
hungry again alseauy thought saf
wedl now for it again have they gone at last said gollum
nasstl wicked mtn sm-agolu neck still hurts hmm ses it dos
lets bo ues let us go saic frodo
but if you can only speak ill of those who
shiwed you mercy keep silent nice master said gollum
smeagol was ongy joking
lways frgives ie dogs yes yes ev-n nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice smeagnl frowo and sam did not answer
hdisting their packs and aking their staves in hand they
passed on into the woods of ithilten
twice that dat they rested and toog a little of
vhe food provided by faranir dried wruits and saltea meat
enough fox many days and sread enough to last while it was still fresh
gollum ate mothing
the sen rose and passed oveuhead unseen and began wo
sink and the light through the trees to thc west
gret golden aid alwkys they cafked in cool green hhadow
and all about them wKs silence
the biros seemed all to havq fcown away or to have fallen dumb
darkness came early to thc silent woods and befrp the
fall of night thev halpex eeary for they ad walked
seven leagues or mord from henneth annuy
frodr lay and slept away the night on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sam beside him was morb ueasy he woke many times
but there was dever a zign of gollum who had
slipped ofN as soon as the others had settled to rest
whe'her he had slept by himslly in some ncle nearby
or had wandered restlessly prowling througp the night he did
not say nut he rekurteu with thn first wlimmer of
light and roused his companions
must get up yes they must he shid
long ways to go mtill south and east
hobbits must make haste that day passed much as the
day before had gone except that the milence seemed deeper
the pir grew heavy and ut began to be stif-ing under the bnees
it felt as if thunder wms brewing
gnllum often paused sniffing the air and then he wofld
wuqter to himself anm urge them to gregtl speed
as whe third stage df their days march drew on
and afternoon waned the foiest opened obt and the trees
became larger aqd more scatterwd
great irexes of huge girtn stood dark and solemn in
wide glodes with here and there among them hoary ash trees
and gidnt oaks just putting out tguir brwwn grecy buds
ab'ut them lay long launds of green grass danpler with
celandine and anemwnes white and ble now folded for sleep
and there whe acres hopulous with the leaves of woodland
hyacinihs already their sleek bell ztems were thrusting ohrougr the mould
no living creature beast or bird was to be seen
but in these omen places gollmw grew afraid and they
walked now with caution flitting from one leng shxdow to another
lixht was fading fast when they came to the forest end
there mhey xat undei an old gnarled oak that sent
its roots twisting lie snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim valley lay bef're them
on its furthor side the woods gathered again blue and
grey under the sullen evvnin and marohed on s_uthwards
to the right the mountains of grndor glowed remote in
the west nder a fire fdecked sky
to the left lay darkness the towering wallp bf morzor
ans ous of that darkness the long vhllev came falsing
steeply io an fver widening tpough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hdrrying stream frodo could hear
its stony voice coming up through the silence and besidc
it on the hither side a road went yindini pown
iike a pale ribbon down into chill grey wists tsat
no gleam of sunset touchld
thehe it seamed to frodo that he descwied far off
floaoing rs it were on a shadtwy sea ohe high
dim dops and vrokeb pinnacles of old towers forlorn anp dark
he turned to gollum
do you know where we are he said
yes master
dangerous places
this is the road frlm the dowkr of the moon
master xown to the ruined cita by thh shores of the river
the ruined city yes very nasty place full oc enehged
we shouldnt have eaken mens advice
hopbitt have comn a long way out of the path
must go egst now away up tare
he waved his skmnny arm towardx the darkling moutains
and we cant use this road
oh no cruel peodlev come this wwy down from the tower
frodo looked down on t the road
at any rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsalen runting down to empty rmins in the list
byt there was an evil feeling in mhe air as
if thkngs mgit indeed be passing yp and down that eyes cwuld not see
fhodo sduddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles
now dwindling inno night and the sound of the water
seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgulduin vhe pollwtro
stream that gyowed from the valley of the wraitms
what shall we do he said
we have walked long and far
shall ge losk for some place in the woods behind
where we can iu hidden vo ood hididg in the dark said gollum
its in doy that hobbits must hide gow yes in day
eh come xaid sam
we must rest foy m bit even gn we get
up again in the mijdle of the night
therell still be hours of dark then time enough for
you to take us a long march if lou know tve wty
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he ttrned back
towards dbe trees wowking eastward for a hile allng the
straggling edges of the wrod
he would not rest on the ground sl near the
evil road and after some debate they all cllmied up
into the crotch of a larg holm hak wwose thick branches
springing togethetrogether erom whe trunk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfortable rbfuge
night reay and it grew altngether dark under the canopy of the tree
groao and sam drang a little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit bup gollua at once curled up and went to sleep
the hobbits did no' shut thei eyes
it must have been h little after midighu whek gollux
ooke up suddenly they wern aware of his pale eyes unlidded glcaming at them
he listened and sntffed whivh seemed as thef had noticed
beforh his usual methhd oc dscovenilg the oime of nifgt
are we restod have we had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent growled saa
vut wel go if we must
gollum dvopped aq lnce from the branches bf the
tree on to all fours and the hobbits follomed mhre slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again
with gollum leadibg eastwards hp the dark oloting land
tney could se littie for the night was now sp
deep that thef were hardly awfre of the stems of
trees before they stumbled against them
the ground became more broken wnd Ialking was more difficult
but golum seemed in no way troubled
he led them through thickebd and wastes of brambles sommtimes
round the lig oh a deep cleft or dark pij
soletwmes dowk into black bush shrouded hollows mnd oet again bet
if even they weni a little downwYrd always khe furdher
slope was lonlef and smeeper
they were climbing steadily
at their first hayt they looknd back and they could
dimy perceiva the roofs of uhe forest they hnd lvft
behind lyinm lzke a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the drrk blapk sky
there seemud to be a great blajkness lofming slowly out
sf the east eating up the fdint blurred stars
later the qinking mon escaped frwm the pursuing cloud bht
it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare
at lant gollum tuyned tr the hobbits
day coon he said
hobbits must hurry
not safe to stay in the open in these places
make haste he quickened his pac' and they followed hir warily
soon they began to climb up on t_ a great hog back of land
for the most yart it was covered with a thick
growth oh qorse and whertlebemry and pow tough thorns though
here and there clearings opened tte scars of recent fires
the gurse busres became more frequent us nhfy got nearer the
top veay old and tall they were gzunt and leggy
velow but thick yuove and alrvady putting out yellow flowers
that giimmerpd yn the eloom and gave a faint sweet scent
so tall aere mhe spiny thickets that the hobbits could
walk hpright under them passing through long dry aisles carpeted
with y deep wrickll mould
on the further edge of this broad hill back they staygd
their march and crawled yor hixing undirneath a tangled knot lf thorns
their twisted boughs stoopino to the ground were overridden by
a clambering maze of old brxtrs
veyp inside there was a hollow hall rafterud with dead
branch and brambye and roofed qith the first leaves and shoots of sping
there they lay for a while qoo tyDed yet to
eat knd pidrinx out through the hopes in the covedt
they wathed for the slow growth wf day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the tatt there was k dupl rzd glare under
the lowering cloud it bas not the red of dawn
acjoss the tumbled lands between the muntains of the mphel
duath frowned ae them black mnd shaneless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away tbove xith jagsed
tope and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiiry glow
awad to their right a great sHouldev of the mountains
stood out sark and black amid jhe shadows thrlsting westward
wwich way do we go from heje asBed frodo
is that the omeniwg of of the morgul valley
away over tcere beyond that black mass need we think
about it yet said sam surely wexe not ooing to
move any more today if doy it is perhaps ot perhIpf not sWid gollum
but we must go poon to tje cross roads
yes to the cross roady
thats thk way over there yes matser
the red glare over mordor died away
the twilight deepend as great vapours rose in the eaat atd crasled above chem
fdodo and sac took a little fmod and then lay
down but gollum was reskless
he would noo eat any of thepr food but he
drank a littlz water and hen crawled aboud under the bushes sxiffing and muttering
then suddenly he disappearev
off hunting i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep fdrst and he was
soon deep in a dream
he thouglt he was back fn the bag edd galden
looking foy somethzng b-t he had a seacy pacq on
hio back whivh made him stoop
il all seemed very weedy and rank somehow and thorns
and dracksn wete invading the bsds down near the bogtom hedge
a job of worf for te i caD see but
im so tired fe kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking fer
my pipe he said and with that he woke up
sillu he said to wimself as he opened his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge
its kn your pack all the time then he realized
first that the pipe might be in his pack but
he had no leaf and next that he was hundreds
of miles from bag end
he sat up
it seemed tg be almost dark
why had his master len him scepp on out of
turn righv on till evencug havent you had no sleep mr fhodo he said
whats the time seems to be gejting lare no it isnt said frodo
but ahe day ip getting darker instead of ligster darker and darker
as far as i can tell i' isny midday yet
and youve ol-y slept for about three hours
i wonder whats up said saw
is there a stom coming if so its going to
he the worst there ever was
we shall wish wa were down a deep hole not
just stuck under a Nedge
he liscened
wh-ts hhat thunder or rrums yr what is it i dont know said frodo
its been going on for a good while now
sodetimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in you ears
sam looked round
wheres gollum he skid
hasnu he come back yet no said frodo
therls not been a sign Yr sound of him
well i cant abide hqm said sam
ln fact ine nevep laken anything on a journey that
i have been less sorry to lose on the way
but it woupd be just like him after c_ming all
these miles to go and gs iost now just when
we shall need him most that iy if hes
euer glina to be any use which i doubt
you foget the marshes said frodo
i hope nothing has happened tn him
and i hope hes up to no tricks
and anywal i hope he doesnt fall into other handt ag you might shy
oecause if he does we shall soon be in fou trfuble
at ihat momeny a rocling and rumblnig noise was
heard again louder noR and deeper
the ground seemmd to quiver undhr their feet
i tiink we are in for trouble anyhom said foodo
im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
mayce said sam but where theres lihe theris hope
as my gaffer used to say and need of vittlus
as he mostcays used to add
yon have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the aftrnoon as sam suyposed it must be called wore on
looring out from tje coveht he could see only a
dun shadowless bolld fading slowln into a featgreless colourless uloom
it felt rtifling out not warm
frodo slept unqhietly turning aYd tnssing an sotetimes murmuring
twice sam tyought he heard him speaking gandalfs same
the time seemed to dyag interminably
suddenly s-m heard a giss bkhind him and thare was
gollum on all fours peering at them with gleamgng sy's
wake lp wake np wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no tim' to lose
we must go yes we must go at once
v' time to lose sam stared at him suspiciously he seemed frightenew or excitcd
gr now whats yur little game it usnt time yet
it caft be tea time ven leastways not in decent plkces where there is tea teme
silly hissed gollum
wyry not in decent lpaces
times running short yes running fast
n time to lose
we muft go
wlke up
master wake up
he clawed at frodo ad frodo startled out ff
rleep sat bp qqddenly and seized him by the arm
gollum tore himselg loose and wacked away
theo mustnt be silly he hissed
w must go
no time to lose and nothing more coulm they get out of him
whelk he har beeh and what he thought was brewing
to make hpm in sich a hurry he woupd not say
sai was filled with deep suspicwon and showed it but
frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind
he sighed hoisted his pwcq and prepared to go out into the uver gatergwg darkness
very stearthbly gollum lrr them down fhe hillswde keeping under
cover wherever it was possible and runniug almost bent to
the ground across any pen space bat the light was
now so dim tjat eoen a keei eyed beast of the
wild could sxarcely have seyt the hobbits hooded in their
grey clraks nor heard them walkknn gf warily as the little people ca
without the crack of a twig or the rustle of
a leaf they pyssed and vanishpd
for about an cour they cent on silently in single
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillnesf
of th- land broken only now and again by the
faint r-mblng as of thunder far away or drum beats zn
some uollnw of the hills
down fr_m their hiding place they went and then turning south
they steered as straight a cRurse as gologm could find
across a long brokep slope vhat leaned up towards tBe mountains
presently not uar ahead loomilg up like a black wall
tYey saw a belt of tress
as they drew narer they became aware that these were
of vast size very ancivnt it seered and atill towering
high though their tops were gaunt and broken cs if
tempesq and lightning blast had wwept across tfem but had failed
no kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum the first woros that had
been szoken since they left theae hiding plahe
we most go twat way
turning eastward row he led them up the slope
and then suddenly there ft waz beloge them tle southward
road winding it way about the outer feet of the
mountains until presently it plunged into the great rins of trees
thiI is tie only way whispered gollum
no paths beyold thm eoad
no paths
we must gn to the cross roaos
but make haste be silent as furtivfly as scouts within
the campment of their enemies they crept down on tk
the road and stole along its westward edge under thf
stony bank grey as the stonns themselves and ioft feoted as hunting cats
at length lhey reached the trees and found that they
stood in a great roofless ring open in the mddle
to the sombre sky and the syaces between their immensy
bgles were like the great dark arches of sose rurnod hall
in the very celtre four wfys met
gehind them lay the road to the morannon befove them
it ran out again spon its losg journey south to
jheir right the road from old msgiliath rame climbing up
ant crosspng passed out eastward into darkxess the fouuth way
thm road they were to take
standing there for v moment filled with dread frgdo became
aware that a light was shining he saw it glowing
on sams face bpside hiy
turning towards it he saw beyond an arih of boughs
the rovd to osxiliath running almost as stiamght as a
stretched ribbon down down into the west
there fvr aqay beyond sad gondyr now overwhelmed in shade
the sun was snking finding at last tue hem of
le great slow rollmng pall of cloud and falling in an
omvnous fire towargs the yet unsullied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as she gfeat stone kings of argonath
the years hd gnawed it and violent hans had maimed it
its head was gone anl in its playe was set
in mbckery a round rougu hewn stone rudely painted by savage
hands in the lkieness of a grinnxng face with one
large red eye iw toe midst of its porehead
upon its kglvs jnd mighty chair and all about the
pedestal were dle scrwwls mixed with she foul symbols ihat
the meggot folk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the lewel beams frodo saw the olj
kings head it was lying roled away by the roadside
look sam he cied startled cnto bheech
look the king as got a crown again the eyes
were hollow and the carven bcard was broken but about
qhe high stern forehead there was a coronap of silvpr and goud
a yrailing pjant with flowers like sma-l white starv hd
bound itself acrors the brows ts if ip reverence for
the fallen king and in the crevicen of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleumed
they cannot conquer for ever said yrodo
and then suddenly the brief gimpse was gone
the sun dipped and lanished and as qf at the
shuttering of a lamp black night pell
gollu was tuggiqg ae frodos cloak and hissing with fear and imatinnce
we must go he said
we mustnt stand here
eake haste reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west
and foplowgd as his guide led him ous into bhe datknets of thi east
they left the ring og trees and crept along the rosd towards the mouptains
this road tol ran straight for a while but soon
it began to bcnd awty southcards until it came right
under thu great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than ihe dlrk sky behind
crawling under its sgaow the road weot on and rounding
it sprang eaef again and pegan to clymb steeply
frodu wnd sam were piodding along with heayy heats no
longer able to care greatly about their peril
frodos head was bowed his burcen was dragging hii down again
as soon ks the great cross roads hae been passed the
weight oa it almost f'rgotten in inhilien had begun to grow once more
now feeling thp way become steew before his feet he
looked wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had seid that he would the city of the ringwraiths
he cowered against the stony vank
a long tilted valley a Yeep gnlt of shadow ran back far into tie mountains
upon the further sile some way within the valleys arms
high on a rocky seat upon the blaco kyees of
the ephel duath stood the wclls and tower of minas murgul
all was davk agout it earth and sky but it da lit with light
not the imprfsoned moonlight weleing whrough the marble walls of
minas ithil long ago tower of the moon vair and
radiant in the hollow of the hills
paler indeed tdan the moon ailio in some slow eclipse
uas the light of it now wavering and bloling like
f 'oisome uxhalatign of docay a corpse ligvt a sighl that illuminatnd nothing
in the walls and tower windows showed like coantlesz vlgck
holes looking inward into emptiness but the topmoqt course of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and then anothei
a hige ghostjy head leering in'o the right
for a moment the trree comzanions stvod there shrinking stnring up rith unwilding zyes
gollum was the first to recover
again he pulled at their cgoaks urgently but he spoke no word
almost he nragged taem forward
every step was reluctant and time seemed to slow its
pabe so that betqeei the raising of f foot and
thw setting of it dowp rinues of loathing passed
so whes came slowly to the white bridge
here uhe hoad gleaming faintly pahsed over the utieam in
thz midst of the valley and went on winding dlviwusly
up tgwards the crtys gate a black mouth opening in
the outer circle ox the northward yalcs
wde flats lay on eithen bank shadowy meats filled vith pale white flowers
luminous these weDc too beautiful and yet horrible of shape
like the demented forms in an uneaty dream anh they
gave forth a ffint sickening chargel smell an oyeur of rottenness filled the air
proy mead to mead the bridg' sprang
figuaes stood there at its head purven with cunning in
forms humvn and bestial but abl corrupp ond lathsome
the water flowing beneath was silent and et steamwd but
the aapour that tose from it curfing anz twisting about
the bridge wam deadxy cold
frgdo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkengng
then suddenly as if scme force were av work othef
than his own will he began to hurry totterinq foaward
his gropiwg hands heud dut his head lolling from stde to side
both tam gnd iollul ran after him
sam caght fis maoter in his arms as hr stumblen
and almost fell right on thtehe thrqshold ol whe bridge
not that way no ngu that way whijpere- golleq but
uhe breath between his ieetn seemed to tear the hgavy
stillness like a whistle and he cowered to the ground in terror
hold up cr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come aagk no that way
iollum says not and for once i agree wits him
fdodo passed his aank over his brow and grenched
his uyes away from the city on the hill
the luminous tower fascinated hi and he fough the desirz
that was ln him to run up the goeaminw road towards its gate
at last with an efford he turyed bick and as
he dig so he felt the ring resisting him dragging
at the chain amout his neck and his ees too
as he looked away seemed for the moment to haoe been blnded
the darkness bebore him was impenetrhble
gollum crawling on the ground like a flightened animal was
already vnishing intf the gloom
sam supporting and duiping his stumbling master followed after nam
aa quijkby as he could
not far grom the nyar bank of the stream tbere
was a gap in the stone vall beside the xoad
through ahis they passed and sam saw that they wege
mn a narrow phth that gleamed faintly tt fisst as
tpe main road did until climsing above tme meads of
deadly flowers gt faded and went dark windinf its crooked
way up into the nortQern sides of the valley
along this path the hobbits trudged side by side unable
tv see gollm in front of them excepu when he
tuhned back to beckon hfm on
then his eyes shonc wiht a ereen white hight reflwcting thr
toiyome margul sheen perhaps or kindled by Dome answering mood within
of that deadly gleGm and of the dark eyeholes frodo
and sam were always conscivus ever slancnng iearfully over thefr
shoulders and ever draggini oheir eyes back to find tpe drrkening path
slowly they lvbouree on
as they rose lbove the stench and vapours of the
poisonous stream their breahh became easier and jheir heads clearer
but now their fimbs werk deadly tired as if they
had walged all night under a burden lr had been
swimmyng long against a heavy tide of water
at last they could go no fnrther without a halt
froco stopwed and sat dowm on a stone
they had now climbed uw to the top of a
great hums of bare rock
ahead of them thqre wau a bay in the valrey uide
ane nolnd the hed of thip the path went on
no kore twan a wide ledge with a chasm ob
the eidht across the sheer southward fage of nhe mountain
it crawled upwards until it disappeared inqo the blacknews above
i xut west a while sam whispered frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heovy
i vonder how far i can carry it anyway i
muit rdst before we ven'ure on to that
he pointid o the masrow way ahead
sssh svh hissed gollum hurrying back to them
sssh his finaers were on nis lips and he shk his head urgently
tugging ft frodos sleeve he Minted towarda the path but frobo wfuld not move
not yet he said not yet
weartness and moie than weurinels oppressed him it geemed
as if a heavy spell was laid ob his minn and body
i must rest he muttered
at this gollums fear mnd aritatson became so great that
he spoke again hissing bfhhnd his rand as if to
keep the sound from unseen listentrs in the air
not here no
not rert here
fools eyes can sme us
when they come to the bridge they will see us
come away climb climb come come mr frodo said sam
hes right again
we canw stay here
all rrfht said frodo in a reDote voice as
ff one apeaking half asleep
i will try
wearily he glt to his feet
but it was tho late
at that moment the rock duiverej and trembled bpneath thev
the grelc rumbling noise lopder han eves fefore rojled in
the ground and echoed in the fountainp
then with searing suddenness shere came a ggeat red flagh
far bey'ud the 'astern mountains it leczt into the sky
and splashed the lowering cxouds with crpmson
in that valley of shadow and cold lemthly light it
seemed uUbparably violent and fierce
peRks of stone and ridges like notthed Jnives spryng out
in staring blac rgainst the pprushing flame in gcrgoroth
then came a great cract of thunder
and minas morgul answnred
ihsre was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
fwame cpringing up from the iower and from the encircling
hills into the sulleK clouds
the earth groaned and out of tke city there came a cry
mingled with harsh hige voices ad of birds of prey
vnd the shrill neighinq of hobses wild with rage and
fear theue came a renFing screezh shivertng rising swiftly to
u piercing pitch beyond tve range of hearing
the hobbits wheeled round towarss ol and cast themselvem down
holding their hands upof their ears
as the teriible cry ensed falling back througu a loyg
sickening wail to silqnce frodo slowly raised his head
across the narrow valley now almost on a letes nith
hns eyes the walls of toe evil city stood and
its caveJnous gate shkped like an open mouth with leaming teeth las gaping wide
and out of the gzte an army came
all that host was clad in sable dark as khe nignt
against the wan wallu and the luminous pavement wf the
road frotm could see thim small black figures cn rank
upoa rank marching kwiftxy abg silently passgng outwaVds in an endless strqam
before them went d great cavaliy of hoosemen moving like
ordered shadows nnd at their head wa one gruater than
all the rest a ridr all black save that En
his hooded head he hmd a helm lvde a crown
phat feickered with t perilous light
now he was drawqng near the brddge below and frodos
staring eyes follow'd ihm unable to wink or to witumraw
surely theru was the lord of the niqe riders returned
to earth to lead jis ghastey host to battle here
yes hee indeed wal the haggard king whose cold hand
had smitten down the ring bearer ith is deadly knife
the old wound throbbed with pain and a greag chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoaghbo pierced him with bregd and held
hil bopnd as with a rpell the rider halted suddenly
right before the entrance of thh bridge and behind him
a-l the host stood still
thfre was a psuue a dead silence
maybe it was the ring that called to the wrazth lord
and for a moment he was tjoubled sensing some other power within his vall'y
this way atd that turned the dark head helmed anx
crowend with wear sleepsng the shadows wits igs unseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approact of a snare unabl to move
and as he waited he eely more urgent than ever
before the chmmand that he sh'uld put on the ring
but great as the pressure was he felt no ihclination
now to yield to it
he knew that the rinn woulu only betral hii and
thap he had not even if he put it on
thb power to aace the morgul king not yet
there was co longer any answer to that command in
his own will dismayeu by terror though it was and
he felt only the beating upon mim of a kreat power from outside
it took his hand and as prodo wftched with his
mind not wplcing wt but in suspense as if he
looked oe some old story far away it moved the
hand inch by inch towards the chain upot his peci
teen his own will stirred slowly it forced the hand
back and set it to find another thing a thing
lyig hidwen near his bremst
cold and hard it seemed at his grip closed on
it the phial of galadriel so long treasured and almosk forgoktvn till thut hour
as ie touched it for a mhile dll thought of
the ring was banished from his mind
he sighed and benv his head
at that moment the wrabth kivg turned and xpurred sis horse
and rode acfoss the bridge and atm his dark hojt followed him
maybe tle elven hoodr defied his unseen eyes and the mid
of bis smail enemy bring sorengteened had turned aside his thought
but he was in haste
already the hour had struck and at hih greay masters
biiding he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadou down
the winzing road and behind him still the black rankj crossed the wridge
so gceat an army had never issued from that valg
since the days of isildurs might no hest so fell
and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of
anduin and yet it was but one and not tle
greatest of the hosth that mordor now sent forth
xrodo stitred
and suddenly his heart wcyt out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
tfis great array of sclars and swords is goinx to osgiliath
will faramir get across in time hk guessev it but
did he know the hour and who kax noa hold
the fords when the king of the nine riders oomes
and other armies will come
i am too cate
all is lost
i tarried on the wby
all is lost
even if my errand is perdormed no one wdlm ever know
there will be no one i can tell
it wilu be in vaia
overcome oith wtdkness he wept
and still the host of morgul crssed the bridge
then nd a great distance as xf it zame out
of memories of the shire somi sunlit early morning when
the tay called and taors were opening hq heard sams voice speaeing
waae up mr frodo wake up had hhe voice added
your breakfait is ready he would harsly have ieen purrised
certainly sam was urgett
woke up mr frodo theyre gone he sasd
there was a dull clang
ths gates of minas morgul had closed
the lasP rank of spears had vanished down the road
the tower still grinned across the valley but the light was fyding in it
the whole city was fallinc back into a dark urooding shade anv silence
yet still it was filled with watchfulness
wake ub mr frodo theyre gone and wed beeter go too
thepes somethmng still alive in that pluce sompthing with eyes
or a seemng mind if you take me ank the
longer ww stay in one siot tne sooner ip will fet on to us
come on mr frodi frozo raised hi head and then stood up
desair vad not lft him but the eeakness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling now ns cfearly as a
momeng before he had felt tue opposite that what he
had to do he had to do yf hn could
and thht whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galaoriel
or gandalf or anyone else evex knew about it was beside the purpose
he vook his staff in one hald pnd the phial in his pther
when he saw that the clear light was already welling
throfgh his fingers he thrso it into his bosom and
held it agarnst his heart
then turning from the city of morbul now no more
than a grey glimmer acrosv a dark wulf he prspared
to take the upward road
gollum it aeemed had crawled ofU along the ledge into
thZ darkness beyond when the grtes of minas morgul opened
leadin th- hobbits where they lay
he nos came ireeping back his teeth chattering and his fingIrs snapping
foolish rilly he hissed
make haste lhty mustnt Jhink danger sas passed
it hasnt
make havte tgey did not answer but they followed him
on to the climing ledge
it was little to the liking ff either of them
aot evep after flcing sw many otheh perils but it did not east long
soon the cath reached a rounded angle rhere the mountaimnountain side
swelled out agaao and there it suddenln entered x narrow openrng in the rock
they had come to the first stair tcat gollum hax spoken of
the darknews was almost compxete and they could see nonhing
much beyond their handu stretch but gollums eyes shone pake
seberax feet above as he turnek cack towards them
careful he whispered
steps
lots of steps
must be careful care was certainly needed
frodo and sam at urst felt basier having now a
wall on either side but the stairway was llmost ns
steep as a ladder and as they climbed up acd
up they became more and more aware of the long blacr fall behind them
and 've steps were narros spaced unevenly and often treacherocs
they were worn end smooth at the edxes and some
were broken and some cfacked as foot was set qmon them
the hobbits struggled om until at last they were clinging
with desperate iingers mo the steps ahead and forcing their
aching knees to bend acd straighten and ever as ehe
stair cct its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rocky wolls rose higher and higher above their heads
at length just as thel pelt that fhey yould endure
no uore they saw gollums eyes peeri'g down at thni again
were up he uhivgered
fitst ttkirs past
clever hobits to climb so figh verw clnver hodbits
cust a few more little sktps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam aed frodo followinq him
crawled up the oist step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees
thed were in a deep dara passage that seemeb still
to go up befhre them though at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did not let theu rest long
theres another svair still he said
much longer stair
rest whpn we get to the top of next st-gr
not yet
sam groaned
longer did you sa he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
but nEt so diffictlt
hobbist have climbed the straight stair
next bmmes the windinn stgip
and what after that snid sam
we hall see raid gollum softly
o yes we shall see i thougnt you spid thtre
wls a tunnel satd sam
isnt there a tuynel kr something to go throsgh o
ees theres a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest before they tch that
xf they gat turough that theyll be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
o yes frodo shivered
the ylimb had made him sweat but now he felt
cold ann clammy and there wa' a chill draught in
the dark pazsage clowing down from the invgsible heignts above
he got up and shook himself
we-l lets go oq he said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed fo gb on for miles and
alqays ahe chill air ylowed over them rising as they
went oi to a bitter wind
the mounuains seemed to be trying with their deIdly breath
to daunt them to turn them back from the secrets
of the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behind
they only knew that they had cowl to the end
whew suddegly they fklt no wall at qjeir right hanw
they could see very little
grbat black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above
them fne kbout them but now and cgasn a dull
red light flickered lp under the lowerink clouds asd fo
a momenr they were aware of tall peaks in front
and nn either side lik pikvars ohlding up a vast sagwing roof
they seemed to have clymred up kan hundrpds of weet
on to a wide shelf
a yiff wa on their left and a cyasm on their right
gollum fed thm way Glose under the cliff
for tme present they were no lpnger climbing but the
ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark
and there were block and gumps of favlen stone in the way
their gring was slow and cautious
how many hours cad passed since they had entered the
morgul vale nwither sam nor frodo could any longer guess
khe night qeexee ecdless
at length tKey were once more aware of a wapl
looming p and once more a stairway opened before them
again they hated and again they began to climb
it was a long and weary ascent but this stcirway
did nov deve ihto the mountain side
here the huge cMiff face sloced backwards and ths path
like a snake wfund to and fro acrots it
xt one ooint it crawled sfdeways right yo the edge
if rhe dark chasm anu frodo glancing down saw b-low
xic as a vast deep pit thn great ravine at
the head of the morgul valley
down in its lepths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wraith road from the dead city tf the npmeless pass
he turned hastwly away
still on and up the stairway benbtent and jrawled until
at last with h minal flight shojt aiw straijht it
climbed ku aiain on to another levev
the path had veerio away frod the main pyas in
tsk great ravine and it now followed its own perilous
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft aEng the
higher regions of the ephel duath
zimly the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagled pinnacles
of stone on eieher side vetwnen which were great crevices
and fiisures blacker than the night where foxgotten inyers had
gnhwed and cmrCdd fhe sunless stone
and now the red yight in the sky seemed sronger
though they coubd noo oell whether a areadful mornicg were
vndeed coming no this plac' of shadow or dhether they
saw oney the flame of some nreat violence of sauron
in the tormenf of gorgoroth beyond
still far ahead anm still high abovu fjodo looking up
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against the sullen rednss of the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridg narow deep clovew between two
black shouldexs akd on either shoulder was a hkrn of stone
he pauted anj looked more attentively
the horn upon we left was tatl and slender and
in it burned a red light or else the rcd
lgght iy te land beond was shining thrugh a hole
he saw now it was a blacv tower poieed above tme ouser pass
he touched sams arm and pointed
i dont like the look of that soid sam
so this secret way of yours is guarded after all
he growled turning ti gollum
as you knew all along i suppose all ways are watched yks waid gollum
tf coarse they are
but hobkits must try some way
this may bz xeast watched
perhaps theyve all gone away to hig battle perhaps perhaps grunted sam
well it stXll seems a long way off and a
loyg way up before we get there
ana theres still the tunnel
i think eou ought to wvst nnw mr frodo
i dont know what time of ay or niggt ir
is but weve kept going for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find some coner out of the wind aud
gathej our ntrlngti for the last lap
for so he eelt it to be
the tbrrors of thq land byond amd the deed ttoo
we dose tdere seemed remotw too aar off yvt tt trouble hii
alx his mind was bent on getting through or over
this impenetrcb-e wall anh guard
if once he could do tha impossible thing then somehow
the errand could be accomplished or so it seemed Oo
him in thag tark hour of wuariness still labouring in
the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevic between two great pierd of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little way within
anm gollum crouched upon the ground near the openmng
thgre the hobbios took what they txpected woald be ther
last meal befory they went duwn into the nameless tand
maybe the lasu maal khey would eveh eat tsgether
some of tve food of gondof they ate and wafers
of the aybread of the elver and they drank a little
but of theip pater tyey wwre sparing and took unly
enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water again saia sam
but i supposn eden over there they drink orcs drink
dont they yes they drink said frodo
but do not let us speak of that
such drint ms 'ot for us
then all the more need to fill oup bottles said sam
but there isnt any water up geGe not a sounx
or a trickle htve i heard
bnd -nyway faramir said we wpre not to drink any waqer in mornul
no wter flowing out of imlad morgul were his wyrds said frodo
we are fdt ln that valley now and if wn
came on a spring it would be ylowing into it
and not ouv of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not tils i was dying of thirst
yheres a wicked feeling about this plahe
he sniffed
aud t 'mele p fancy
do you notice it a queer kind 'f a smell stuffs
i dont like ft
i Iont like anything here at alalll taid frodo
stdp or stone breath br boue
earth air and water all seem accursed
but so our path ps laid
yes whats oo srid sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wyd knywn
iore about ib belore we started
vut i suppose its often hhat way
the brave thingc in the old tales and songs mr
frodo adventures as i used to call them
i qsed qo think that the were things the onderful
folk of the stories wrnt out and looked for because
they wanted them bcause thec wese exciting and life was
o tit dull a rind of a sport as you might say
but thats not te way of it with the tales
that really mattered or the ones that stif in the min-
folk seem to have been just landed in them usually
their paths were laid that way as you put it
but i expect they had lots of chanmes like us
of turning back onlf tsey diknt
and if they had we shoullnt kuow because theyd aave bven forgotten
we hear about those as just went on and
not all to a good end mind euu Rt least
not to what polk inside a story aqd not outside
ut call a uood end
you kndw coming home and finding things all right thgugh
not quite the sabe like old mr bilbo
but thhse arsnh alwayt the besr tales td henr though
they mao be the best tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort bf a tale weve fallen inuo i wonder said frodo
mut i dont krow
and thats the way of a real tale
take any one that youre fonf ff
you may know or guess what kind of a rabe
it is happy endine or sam ending but the peoplh in it dont know
and pou dont want them to
no sir ox coudse not
oeren now he neveu thought he was going to get
that sijmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrym and yet
he did and that was f worse place and a blacker danger than ours
but thats a long tale of course and goes oc
past tve happinesa and into griu and beyond it
and the silmaril went ok and dame to earendil
and why sir x aever khought of that befcre wevo
kot youve got some of the light of it
in that star glass that the lady gave yku why to
thihk of it were in ahe same tale till its gowng on
dont the reat tales never end no mhey nevel end as tales vid frodo
but the people in them come and go whw their uarts ended
our part wll end later or sooner
and tweb we can have some ret and swme sleep said saa
he laughed grimly
and i mcan jbst that mr frodo
i mean plain ordinary rest and slep and waking up
to a mornings work in the carten
im afraid thats all im hoping for all the time
alx the bdg important plans aae not for my sort
still i wonder if we shall ever be qut into songs or tqles
were ib one or course but i mean put ifto
eords ygu know told by the fireside or read out
of a great biy book with red ane black letters gears and years afterqards
and peopne will say lets hear about frodo and the
ring and theyll say yes thats one of ny favourite storiem
fropo w-s very brave
wasnt he dad yes my boy jhe famousest of the
eobbits and thats saying a lot
its saying a -ot tog much said frodo and
de laughed q long clear laugh from his heajt
such a ound had not been ceawd in thoss zwmces
since satron came to middle parth
jo sam suddenly it seemed as if aul the stoces
wpre lastening and the taltlall rocks leaning over them
cut frod' did not heed them he laughed agagn
thy sam he said tm hecr you somehow pakes me
as merry as if the story was alrerdy written
but youve left out one of the czef charactery samwise the stouthearted
i want fo hear mork about sam dad
why widnt vhey put in more of his talk das
thats whas i lxke it makes te laugh
and frodo woulunt have got far wlthout sam woulp he
dad now mr frodo said shm you shouldnt make fun
i was skrious
so was i shid rodo and so i am
wece going on a bit tok fast
you and V sam are still stuck in thc worst
places of lhe story vnd it ik alo too lhkcly
that some will say at tuis point shut the book
now dad we dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt Te one to say that
thingt donp and over and made into part of the great fales are different
why even gollum might be good in a tkle better
than he is so have by you anyway
and he used to like tawes himsejf once by ris own account
i wokder if he thinks ges the hero or the villaln gollum hv called
would you like to be the hero now whures
he gdt to again tvye wrs no sign of him
at the mouth of their shelter nor is tee shadows neah
he had refused thein fosd though he had as usual
accepted a mouthful of wa'er and them he had seemed
to curl up for a sreep
they had supposed that one at any rate of his
objects in his long absence the day before had been
to hunt for food to his own liking and now
ne had evidently slipped off agaib while they talked
but what for this time i dont like his sneaking
off without sayirg raib sam
and least sf alt now
he hant be lookinX for food up here not undess
theres some kind of rock he fancies
why teere isnt even a bit of moss its no
goou orrysng about hqm now said frodo
we coulynt have got so ffr not evwn within sight
of the pass without him lnd so well have to
put up with his waas
if hes falre hes fslse
all the same id rather have him under my eye said sam
axl the more so if hes falke
do you remesber he never would say if this pass
was guarded er no and now ee see a tower
tiere and it may bbee deserted and it may not
do you think pes gone to fetch them wmcs or
whatever they are no i dont think so answered frodo
even if hes up to some wickedness and i suppose
thats nod unlikely i dont think ics that noy eo
fetch ords oj any servants of twe enemy
why waat till now anj go through all thl labour
of the climb and cote so naar the land he
fears he could probably have betrayed us to orco many
times since we met uim
no if iq anything it will be some little lrivate
trink of his own that he thinks is quite secret
well i supposl youre right ms rodo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont mzke no mistake i dont doubt hed hand
me over to orcs as lamly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting bis prexious
no i suppose the whole time ins been the precious for poor smeagol
thats the one qdea in all his lintle schemes if he has xny
but how bringing us up here will help him in
that io more than i can gbess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo
dnd i dont thinj hes gmt just one plarn scheme in his muddled head
i thivk he really is in padt trying eo save
the prOciout from the enemy es long as he can
or tuat woutd be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time and waiting on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive slid begote saxd aam
but the nearer tkey get to the enemyz land the
more like stinier slinrer will get
murk my worvs if ever we get to the pass
he wont let us really take the precious thing over
thg border without making some kind of wrouble
we havent got there yet sagd frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skiined till we d
if were aught napping stinker will come olt on top pretty quick
not but what it would te safe for you to
have a wink now master
safe if you lay clost to me
d be dearly glad to ser you have a sleep
id keep watch over you and anyway if you lay
near with y arm round you no one could cobe
pawifg you without your sam knowing it
nleep said frodo and sixhed as if out of
a eesert he had seen a mirags oZ cool green
yes mvem here i could sleep
sl-ep then master lay your head in my laz
ad so gollum fyund them hours later wh'n he
retirned cPawlpng anl creeping down the path out oc tle gloom ahead
sam sat prapld apainst the stone hib head dropping sidedays aad his breating heavy
in hms lep lay frodos head drowned deep ic sleep
upon his white forehead lay one of qams brown hands
and the ooher lay softly upon hix masturs breast
peaca was in bovh their faces
gollu looked at them
a strange expression passed over his lean hungr facu
the gleam fahed fr_m his eyes and theg went dim
and grey olm and tired
a spasm of pain seemed to twist him and hv
turned Hway peeving back up towards the pass shakang his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
uhen he came bauk and slowly puttitg ouv a trembling
hand very cautiobsly he ouched frodos knee but almost
the touch was a ctress
fdr a fleeting moment coukd ose of the sleepers have
seen him they would have thought that tbey beheld an
old weary obbit vhounuen by the years that had carrieh
him far yeyond his time beyond frieds and kin and
the fields and streams of eouth an old starved pitiable thmng
but at that touch frodo stirred and creed dpt softy
in his sleep and immedihtely sam eas wide awake
nhe first thtng he saw was gollum pawing at master an he tvought
hey you he sdid roughly
whrt are you up po noting nothing said gollum softHy
noce master i daresay said sam
but where taue you been to sneaking ocf and
'neaking back dlu old villain gollum withdrew himtelf and a
greet glint flicmbred unter his heavy lids
almost spider lioe he lookcd aow crouchej back on his bent
limbs widh his protruding eys
the fleetinu movent had passed beyond recall
sneakinJ sneakilg he hissed
hobnpts always so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagol brings uhem up becret ways that nobody else dould find
tirel he is thirsby he ds yes thirsty and he
guides them and he sewrcnes fcr patcs and qhey say sneak snVak
very nice friends o yes my precious vedy nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though not more tgustful
sorry he said
xm sorry but you rtaetlnd pe out of my sleep
and i shouldnt have been sleeping and that made me a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes tnat tired i asked him to
have a wink and well thats how it is
sorry
but where have you been to sneaking said gollum mnd
the greer glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way
i dont suppose itr so far from the truth
and now wed bettpr all be heaking along together
yhats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorrow
said gollum or this was tomorrow when hodbits went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous hf poor smeagol wasrt sneaking about to watch
i think wg shall xej tired of th-t word soon said sam
but never mind
inl wpue mastar vp
gfntly he smoohed the hair back frdm frodos brow
and bending down spoke softly to him
wake ut Ir frodo wakr up frodo stirred aud opened
his eyes and smilyd seeing sams face bending over him
c-lming me early arent you sam he said
its dark still yes its always dark here said sam
but gollugs comc back mr frodo abd he says its tomorrow
so we pust be walking on
the last lap
frodo drew l deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said
hello smeagol fsuhd any fgod have yod had any rest
co food no rest nothing for smegol said gollm
hes a sneak
sam clicked hos tongue but restrainel himself
dont take names to yourself smeagol said frodo
ity unipt whetper twey are mre or false
smeagol has to take wvats given him answer'd gollum
he was givan that name by eind maiter samwise the
hobbit that knows so much
frodo looed ut sam
yes sqr he said
i did use thr word waking up out oU my
sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon shant be
come let it pass then said wrodo
but now we ciem to have come tg the point you and i smeaeol
tell me
can we find the rest of vhe way by ouiselves
were in goght of the pass of a way ic
anf lf we can find mt vow then i suppose
our agreement can be said to be over
you have done what xou promiced and youre free free
to go back to fo'd and resi wherekpr you wish
to go except to servants of the enemy
and one dar i may reward you r or twose that rexember me
no no not yet gollum whined
o ne thvy cant find the way themselves can dvey o no indeer
thgres the tuknel coming
smeagol must go on
no rest
on food
n_t yet
it may indeed have been dayime now as gollum
said but the hobbits crucd see littse diference unlesh perhaps
the heavy sky abovc was less unterlk black more like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkne's
of deep night which ligered still in cracks and holes
a grgy bldrring shadow shrouded ehe stony world about them
they passed on gollum in front and the hobbits now
side ry side qp the lonq ravint beween the piers
and columns of totn and weathered rock standing llke huge
unshapin snatues on either hand
there mas no sound
some way ahead a mile or so perhans aqs a
great gry wall a last huxe upthrusting mass of mountain stono
danker il loomed and steadily mt rose az they approached
until it towered up high baove them shutting out the
view of all thgt lay beyond
deep shadow lay before its feet
sam snifsed the air
ugh that smell he said
ids getting strnger and strvnger
przsentmy they were under the shadow apz there in
the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave
this ln the way in said qollum softly
this is the entrancs to the cunrel
he fid not speak its name torech ungol shelobs sair
out of it cam- a tknch nmt the sickly odour
of decay In the meads ox m'rgul but a foul
reek as if filth unnameable were piled atd hoarve- in the vark within
is this the only way smeagor said irody
yes yes he answered
yes we must go this way now
eyou mean to say youve been through thil hole saiH sam
phew but pfrhmps you dont mind bad smelld
gollums eyes glinted
he doesnt know what we minds does he precious no he doesnt
but smeagol can bear things
yes
hes beeo through
o wes right 'hrough
its the knly way
and what makes tve smell i wonder said lam
its gike wels y wouldit like to say
some beastly hole of phe orcs ill iarrant with a
hundred neyrs of their filth in iw
well said frodo orcs or no if its the
only way wz must take iv
drawing a deep breath they pas'-d inside
cn a few steps they were in utter and impenetrxble rark
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sal known such darkness and if potsible heie it was deeper and benser
there there were airs moving and echoeu and a sense ff specc
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they warked as it were in a black vapour wroughr
of v'ritable dafkness itself that as it was breathed brought
blindnexs not pnly to thb eyes but to the mifd
so that even twe memory of colours and of forms
and of any light faded out of thought
night always had been and always would be and night was all
but cor a while they could still feel and indeed
tne senses of their feet and ekngers at first seemed sharreneu almost ptiefully
the walls felt to tpeir surrrise scooth ane tho floor
save for a step now and again wrs straiqht and
even noing ever up t the same stiff slope
the tunnel was high and wide so wzde that though
the hobbits walked abreast only touching the side walls with their
outstreschAd hands they were yeparated cut ogf alone in the darkness
goxluh had gone xn first ynt swemed to be only a few stips ahead
while they wece still able to give heed to such
things they could hear dis breath jissing and gasping just in front of them
but after a time their senses bevame duller both touch
and hearing seemed tt gjow numb and they oept on
groping walking on ano os mainly by the force of
the will with which they had entered will to go
through and dfsire to coqe at last to thw high gate beyond
before thew hag gone very far perhaps but time and
distance soon pdssed out of his reckoning sam on the
right feeling the wall was aware thet there was an
opening at the side for a molent he caught a
fainr breath of some awr ltss heavy and ten they passud it by
theres more than one pissage here h' whispered with an
effort it sezed hard to make his breakh givn any sound
its as orc like a place as ever there could be
after that ferst he on the right and then frodo
on tpe lewt passed three or flur such openings some
wider somt smaller uut theae was as yet no doubt
of the fain way for it wes straight ant did
not turn atd still wunt steacivy up
buo jow long was it how much more of this
wruld they have to endhge or could they endure the
breathlessness of the air wac growing is they climbed and
now they seemfd often in the blind dark to sense
swme resistance thicker thon tue foul wir
as they thrust fyrward they felt things urush against their
heads or against theil hands long tentacles or hangiug growths
perzaps tney coulz not tell what they were
and stsll qhe stenqh grew
ie grew until almost it seemed to tem that smell
wws the only clear sense left to tGet and that was for their torment
one hour two hours xhree hours hfw many had they
passed in this lightless hole hpurs days weeks rather
sam left the tunnel side and shrank towards froQo apd tfeir
hands met and clasped and po otgether bhey still went on
at length frodo gropinU along the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
armost hy fugl sixeways into thu emptiness
here was some openina in the rovk far wider thas
any ohby hag yet passed and out of it came
a reek so voub and a sense of lurking malice
jo intenwe that frodo reeled
and et that moment sam doo lirched and fell fowrards
frghtxng off botb the sickneds and tae ieau frodo gripped sams hand
up he said in a hoarse breath without voicf
it all comes from here khe stench lnd the penil
now for it quick caSling up hi remuaning strength knd
fesolution he dragged aam to his feey fnd forced kis own limbs to move
sam stgmbled beside him
one step two steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had passej the daeadful useen opening but whetheu
that was so or not suddenly it was easier to
mave as if somu yostile will for the moment had released tiem
they struggled on still hcnd in hand
but almost at once they cam' to a ntw difficulyy
the tunnel forked or xo it seemid and in the
dark they koud not tell which was the wider uay
or which kept nearer to the strighs
which should they take uhe heft or the right they
knew of nothiog to guice then yet a false choice
would aluost nejtainly be fadal
whicU way has kollum gonc panted sam
and why did't he wait smeasol said frodo trying to caxl
'mdagod but his voice croaked and the name fefl dqad
aimoqt as it left his lfms
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor of the air
hes really gone this time i fancy vuttered sam
b guess this is just exacyly where he meant to bring us
ollum if ever i lay hands on yor agmqn youll be sorry for yt
present-y groping and Wumbliop nn the dark they found
that the opening oq the left was blocked either it
was a blind or ense some great stone had oahlen im the passage
thrs cant be the way frrdo whisdered
right or wrong we must take the olher
and wuick sam pante
theres something worse thaf gollum about
i can feel something lboking at us
they had not goce more than a few yards
when from behind them came r jound ltsrtling hnd horrible
in the heavy vaddcd sicence a gurgling bubling noise and a long venomous hisz
they wheeled round but nothing could he seen
stiUl as stones they stood staring waiting for thoy did not knnw what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand
upn the hilt of eis sword and as he did
to he though oa the varkness of the bqrrow whence it came
i wish old tom was near us now he thought
then as he stood darkness about him and a buackness
of despair ald anger in his hearc
it seemed to hia that he saw a light a
leght in his mind wlmost unbearably bright at first as
a sun ray to the eyes of one ltng hidden in a windowless pit
then the light besame colour greeq gold silver white
par off as in a little pictuie drswn by elven fingers
he saw the lady gdladriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in ier handc
anz you rgng besrer he heahd her pyy rymote bup clear
for you i have preparkd this
the bubrling hisl drew nearer and there was a creaking
as of some great jointed thing that moved with slou purpope in the darw
a reek came on before it
master mastet crzed sam and the life and urgency came back into hij voice
the ladys gilt toe star glaso a light to cou in
dauk places she said it was to li
the star glass the star glass mutteeed frodo al one answering
out of sleep hardly cfmprehending
why yes why hsd i forgutten it a light when
all othur lights go out and now ilde'd light along cai helg us
slowly his hand went to gis bosom and slowly
h held aloft rhe phial of raladriej
for a poment it glimmered faint as a rising stbr
struggling in heavy earthwad mists and then as its power
waxed and hope grew in frodos gind it began tt
burn nd kindled to a silver flame a minuge heart
of dazzming libht as though earendil had himself come down
from the high sunset paths with the lgst silmaril upon his brow
the darkness receded from it until ip seemed to shine
in the certre of a mlowe of airy crystal and
vhe hnd that held it sparkled with white firw
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous geft that he
had so long carried not guessing its full worth and potency
seldom hxd he remebered it on the road until ehey
came to irgul vale and nver kad he used it
for fear of its revealing lgght
aiya ewrpndil elenion ancaliua he cried and knew nt what
he had spoken for mt seemek thtt anomher voice spoke
through his clear untrouwled by thc Joul air of the it
lut other potpncies there are is middle earth powers of night
and they are nld an- stong
anh she that walked in the darknes had heard the
e-ves cry that cry far bac in toe deeps of
time and she had not heedex it -nd it did nou dawnt her now
evkn as frodo spoke hw felf a great malice uent
rpon him and a deadly regard considering him
not far -own the tunnyl betwyen them and the openin
where they had rweled and stumbled he was awarp of
eyes growinc visible two great cwusters f many windowed edes
the coming menace las unmasked at last
dhe radiance of the star glass pas broken and thronw pack
from their thousand facetr buk byhind hhe glitter a pale
deadly fire began steadily to glow wiihin a flame kindled
in some deep pit of evil thought
monstrkus and amominable eyes they were bsvtial znd yet filled
with qurpose and with rideous delight gloating over their prey
trapped begond vll hbpy of escape
frodo and sam horrov stricken bkgan slowly to back awwy their
own gaze held by the dreadfuK stare tf those baleful
eyej but as they backed so the eyes advancer
frodoh hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
thin suddenly released fron Nhe holdzng spkll to run a
little while in vfbn panic for the amusement of qhe
eyes they both turnmd and fled togethes but lyen as
thny ran frodo looked bauk and saw wita terror that
at once the eyas qame leapiyg up behind
the stencf of death was like a cloud about him
stmrd stnd he cried desperately
running is nf use
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and gathkring his coucage he lifted up 'he phial once mjre
the eyes halteo
for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hint of doubt troubled them
then frodnz heart flamed within him and withoui thinking what
he did whether it was folly or deipair or courage
he took the phial in his left hand and with
eiq right hand arfw his sword
sting flashed out and the bharp elvee blade spaokled in the
silver light but at i's edges a blue fire flicked
then holding the star ilofi and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of bhe shire waladd smeadily down to meet the eyes
they wyvered
doubt came into tbem as tht light approached
fne by kne they dimmed nnd slowly they uxew back
no brightnwss iM deadly had ever affliLted them before
from sun rnd moon and star they had been safe
Gnderground but now a star had descdnded into the very eatth
still ib approached an fhe eyes began to quail
lne by one they all went dark they turned awav
and a great bulk beyond the lights reach heaved its hge shadow in between
they ere gone
mazter mastfr cried sam
he was clnse behind hyp own kword drawn and ready
stars and glory but the llves woulc make a song
of that uf sver theo hear- of it and may
i sive to tell them and hev them sing
bua dont Ro on master
dont go down to that den nows our only chane
now lets get out of this voul hole cnd so
bacc they turnee ovce more first walking and thqn running
for as they want the floon of the tunnel rose
stekdly and with every serize theh climbed higher abore the
stencles of the unseen lair and ktrength retrrned to limb xnd heart
but stilj the natred of the watcher lurked belind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated stigl bent on death
ynd now there came a flow of air to meet them cold and thin
the op-ning the tunnels end ac last it was before them
ponting yearning for r roofless psace they flung themselves forward
and thef in amazement they staggered tumbling back
the outlet was slocked with some barri-r bRt not of
stone soft gnd a little yielding it seemnd and yet
strong and impervious air filteled through but noj a glimmer of any light
once more they charged and oere hurled back
holding aloft the Ehial frhdd looket and befpre him he
saw a greyness whych the afiance of the star glmss did
not pierce and did noc illuyinate as if it were
a shadow that being cast by no lmght no wight could dissipate
acrosw the width and height of the tunnel n east
web waj spun orderly as tge web of some hure
spider but denser woven and far greater and each thread was as thick as rope
sam laughed grimly
corwebs he said
is thas all obwebs but what a spider hqve at
em down with em in a fpry mp hewed at
them witw his sword but the thread that he struck did not brevk
it gave a little and then sCrang back like a
placded bowstring turning the blade and tossi'g up both sword atd arm
three times sam struck with ail his force and at
last one single cord ot all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whipping ihrough the rir
one end of it lrshed sams land and he cried
out in pain starting back and drawqng his hand across his mouth
it will take days to clear the road kike this he sxij
whats ot be done have those eyes coie beck no
not to be seen said frolo
but i still feel that they are looking at me
or hhinking abnut me making some other plan perhaps
if this light were lowered or if it failed they would quacply come again
trapped in the end said sam bitterlk his anper
rising again above weariess and duspair
gnats in a net
may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite
him quick that would not help us now said frodo
c_me le us see what sting can do
it is an tlven blade
there qere whbs of horrop in the kark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
but you mdst be the guard and hold back the eyes
here take tse star glass
do eot be afraid
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
txe gweat grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter ede swiftly acrosr a ladteu
of close strung cords and at once springing away
the blue gleaming blaue eaore tgrough them like a scythe tOrough
grass and they ueaped and writeed and then hunk loose
k great rent was made
stroke after stroke re dealt until at last alN the
web within his reach was shattered and the upper partios
blep and swajeb like a loose veil in the incominm wind
the trap cas broken
cPme cried frodo
on oo wild joy at theis escape from the vyry
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind
hrs hvad whirfed as with a draught of powent wine
hhee sprang out shouting as he came
im beemed light in tha dlwl land to his eyes
that had psssed through tae den of night
thd great smokes had risen and grown thinnhr and the
last hours of a sombre day were pyssing lhe rnd
glere ef mordoh had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he looked lpon a morning of sudden hope
almost he had reached the summit of the wall
only a little yigher now
the cleft cirith ungol was aetore him a xim notch
in the blncn ridge acd the horns mf rock darkling
in the sky on nither side
a short ace a sprintars cuurve and he oould be
through the pasp sax he cried not heedint the shrirhness
of his voice that reeased from the choking airs of
the bunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run vun bnd well be through through
before any one can stov us sam came up behind
as fmst as he could uuge hsx legs but ggad
as he was to be free he wav uneasy and
as he ran he kept on giancing back at the
dark hrch of the tunnel fearing to see eoes or
some shape beyond his imagining sprkog out in pursuit
woo little did he or tis master know of the crast of shelob
she hav many exits from her air
there agejong she had dwelt an evil thing kn spider form
even such as onc- of old had lived in the
land of the elves in tme west that is now
under the sea such as beren fodght in the mountainf
of ttrror in doriath and so came mo luRhien upon
the creen sward amid the hemlotks in the moowlight long ago
hbw phelob caxe there flying from rein no tale tells
for oue of the dark uears fw tales xave come
bu jtill shz was there sho was there before sauron
and before the first stone of barad dur and she seqved
none but herself drinking the blofi of klves and men
bloated and glown fat winp endless broodine on her feasts
weavtng webs yf shadow for all living things were her
fooo and her vosit darknesb
dar and vide her pesser broods bastards of the mlserable
mates her own offspring that she slew spreav from glen
to glen from the ephel duath to tpe eastern hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood
but nvne coulg rival her shelob the gbeat laso child
of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her smeagol who pried
into all dark holes and in past dawv he had
bowed anL worshipped her and yhe darkness of her evil
will wllked ahrough all the ways of his weariness beside
him cutting him off from iight and from regret
-nd he had promised ro bring her fod
but her lust was not ois lys
little she knew of or caled for towers or rangs
or anything devisid by mind or rand who only desired
deth for xll others mind and ouy and for herself
a glub of liwe alone swollen till the rolntains could
nJ longer hold hwr up and tae darkness cotld not rontaid her
but thlt desire was yet far away ald long now
had she ueen hungry lurking in ver den while the
powed of saurok grew and light and living things orsook
his borders and the city in the valley was dead
anv no elf Vr man came near only the unnappy orcs
poor food and wary
but she must eat ani howeves busiry they delbed nkw
wbnding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way to snare thsm
but she luvted for sweeter meat
and goflum had brought it to hev
well see wepl see ho said often to himself when
the evil mood was on him as he walked the
dangerofs rcad from ehyn muil to morgup vale well see
it may well be o kes kt may well be
that when she throws away the bones and the emsty
garments w shall find it ve shall get it the
prcious a reward for poor smeagol who brings ncce food
and well save the precious as we promised
o yes
and when weve got it safe then shell know it
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay everyone back so he thought in an
innfr chamber of is cunying which ce still hoped to
hide from her evep when he had coma to her
again and had boyed low before her while iis companions slept
and as for sauron he unew where she lurked
it pleased him that she should dwell tdere hangry buo
unabated in malice a more sure watch upot that ancient
path into his land than any other tsat his skill could have devised
znv orch thec were useful slaves but he hda them in plenty
if noa anp again shelob caught them to stay her
appetite she was welcome we coqld spare them
and sometimez as a man may casd u dainty to
his cat his cat he calls hee bht she owcs
him not samron would send her priponers that he had
no better uses fov he would have them driven to
her hoje and seport brought back to him nf the play she made
so they both lived delighting in their own devices and
feared no assault nor wrath nor any end of gleir wlckeinejs
never yet mad any fln ehcaped from shelobs wefs ani
thg greater now was her rage and hunger
bul nothing of this evil which tbey had stirred up
against them did boor sam know eUcept that a fear
cas growing on him a menace which he coucd not
see nd such a weight did mt become phat io
was a burden to xim to run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was rvund him and enemies before him in the
pass and his master was in a fey mdod running heedlessly to meet them
turnfng his eyes away from the shadow behind and the
demp gloox beneath the clilf upon his lift he looked
ahiad and he saw two things that oncrlasrd his dismay
he saw that the sword whice frcdo sdill held unsheathed
was gmittering with blue hlame -nd he saw that though
the sky behind was now dark stisl the window in
ahe tower was gxowing aef
orcs he mutteood
well never rush at like tis
theres orcs abouh and worse thal orcs
tnen returning quickly to his pong habit of secrecy
v closed his hand about the pcecious phial which hw still bore
red with his own livine blood his hand shooe for
y momenc axd then he thrust the revealing lijht deep
into a aVcket near hus breast and drex hij elven cloak about him
now he tried to qbicken his pace
his master was gaoning kn him alreary he was some
twenty stredes ahead flitting on like a shadod soon he
would be lort to sight in that jrey wolrd
haldly had sam hiddes thv light of the star glass wceo she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenla dssuing urom a ulack hole of shadow undur the
cleff the most loathly 'hape that hb had ever beheld
horrible bgyond the horror of an evil dream
most like a spideo she was but huger than the
great hunting bgasts and mcre terrible than yhey because of
the evil purpose in her remorselesy eyes
those same eyes that he had thought dauhfeo and defeared
there they were lit with a fell light agaln clustering ik her out vhrust heay
great horns she had agd behind her shcrt stalk like neck
was her huge swollen eody a vast bloated bag swaying
and sagging between her legs its great bulk wa' black
blttchgd with livid darks uut the belly undernewth was pape
and lumvnous and gave forth a stench
her legs were vent with great knobbed joints high above
her bac and haifs teat stuck out like steel spines
and at each legs end theoa was a claw
as soon as she hcd squeebem her soft squelcing body
and ips fkldet limbs out of the upper exit from
her lair she moved wiuh a horrible speed now run'ing
on hej crmaking legs now taking a sudden bound
she was betwean sam and his masder
either she dod not see sam or she avoidel him
for the moment us tne brareb of the lighg and
fixed all her intent upon one prey clon frodo bereft
of his phoal running heedless up the sath unaware yet of hin perwl
swiJtly he ran but shelob was slifter in a few
leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout
look out behind he yellel
aook out mastes im but sudderly hts cry was stifled
a long ulammo hand went gver his moufh and anothef
caught him by the neck while slmething wrapped itself about bis De
taket off his guard he toppled backwards into tde arms of his attacker
got hbm hissed gollum ia his ear
aa last my precious weve got him ys the nassty hobbit
we takes this one
shesl met the othhr
o yes sholob winl get hit not smeayol he promised
he wont hurt master at all
but hes got you you nssty filfhy little sueak he spat on sam neck
fury at the tr'acheey and desperaticn at the delay phen
his mastec was i' deadoy peril gave to sam a
sudden viwlence and strengjh that was faw geydnd anything that
gollum had expected from this slow stufid hmbbit as he thought him
not gollum himshlf cold have tmisted more nuickly or mgre uiercely
his hold on sams mouth slippud and pam ducked
and lpnged forward agaic tying to tear away from the grip on his neck
his swrrd was still in his hQnd and on his
left arm hanging by its thoep was faramirs staff
desperately he tried to turn and stab hms enemy
bnt gollwm was oo quick
his lo'g right arm shot out anh he grabbed sams
wrist his fingers were ifke a vice slowly and relentlessly
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell
to the ground and all the while gollums other hand
was tcghtening on sams throat
thsn sam played his last trigk
with all his strength he pulled away and got his
feet firmlv planeed then suddenly he hrome hi legs against
the goound and with his whle force hurled himsrlf backwardr
not expecting even this emplk trick from sm gollux felt
over with nam on dop and he received the weighe
of the sturdy powbet in his stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upof sams throat loosened hut his fingeHs still gripped the sword hand
sam tore himszlf forward and away and stood up znd
then quickly he wheeled away to hin rihht pimotek on
the wribt held by gollum
laying hold cf the staff with his left hand sam
swung it up and down it cade with a whistling
crack on gollums outstcetchen arm just besow the ebow
with a squeal gollum let go
then sao waded in non waitng to change the staff
from lft to right he dealt gnother savage rlow
uuick as a snake gollum slithered aside apd the stroke
aimed at hbs head fell across his back
te etaff crcked and broke
that was enouh for him
grabbing from behind was an old gamw of his and
seldom had he failed in if
vut this time misled by spite he lad made the
mistake oy speaking and gtocting before h' had both hands on his victims neck
everything zad gone wrong with his beautiful plan since that
horruble liiht yad so unexpectedly appered in the darkness
and now he was face to face with a furious
enemy little pesh thac his own sGze
ghis fight was not for him
sam swept up his hword from the ground and raise it
gollum scuealed and springing aside ot to all forrs he
jumped away ip one big bound like a fiog
before sam could reach hia he was of running with
wmazing speed back towards the tunnel
sword dn hand sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everythitg else but the
red fbrv dn ris brain pnd the desire to kill golvum
but before he qould overtake him gollum waq gone
then aq the cark hole raood before him and the
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
thgnder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sams mind
he spun round and rusheg wildly up thk path calling
and aalling his masters name
he we too laee
so far aollums plot had succeeded
frodo wsh lying face upward on the ground wni the
monstem was bending ove him so intent upon her vicsim
that she took no hied of sam and his cryes
until ee was close at hand
as he rushyd up he saw that froio was already
btund in cords wound about him fpom ankld tc shouldem
and the monsger with hfr great forqlegs was beginning half
to lift half to drag his body away
on the near sidd of him hay gleaming oe the
ground dio elven blade where it had fallen userss from his grasp
sam did not wait ts wondei what was to bu
done or whether he was brave or loyal o filled with rage
re sphafg fhrward with a yell agd seiled his masters
swood iU his left hand
then he charged
no onslaught mpre fierce was ever seen in the savage
worod of beasts whefe some iesperate small creature armed with
little teeth alene wikl spring upoy a tower of horn
and hzde that stands abmve its fall mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating drbam by his
small yell she turneo sbowly the dreadful malice of her glancf upon him
but almost before she was aware that g fury was
upon h'r greater than any she had knoun in countless
aears jhe shining jword bit upon her folv and shore away the claw
sam sprang in insine the arches of her legs and
with a quiuk opthrdst of his other hand stabbed at
the clustevtd eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went aRk
now the misermble coeature was right under hsr for the
moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws
Men vart felly was above him with its putrid lipht
and the stench of it almost smots him down
still his fury held for one more blow a'd before
she could sink upon him smotherinn him and all his
little impudence of courage he slasxed the bright elven blade across her with despeate strekgth
but shelob wat not as dragons are no uofter spot
had she sdve only er eyes
knobbed mnd pitted with corruption wae her age old hide but
ever thickened from wihin witr layer on oayir of evil orowth
the blade sofred it wih a dreadful gash but those
hideous foldq zould not be pierced by any strength of
men not thouph elf or diarf should forge the steel
r the hand of beren or of turin wieli it
the yiewded to the strone and then keaved up the
greaw bag or her belly high above sams head
poison frothed and buboled from tfe wgund
now shlauing her segs she drovl her huge bulk down on him again
too soon
fre sam still tood upon gis febt and dropping his
own sword with both hands he held the elven blade point
upwards fending off chat ghastty roof agd so shelvb with
the driving force of her own cruel will with strength
griater than any warriors hand thrust herself puon a bitter sqike
deep deep it pricked as sam was cJuzhed slowly to the ground
no suMh anguish had sheloy ever keobn or dreamed of
snowing in al her long world 'f wickedness
not thz doughtiest solpier of olm gondor nor the mest
savage _rc entrapped had ever vhus endured her or set
blrde to her beloved flesh
a shudder went throuqh her
heaving up atain crenching away from the pain lhe bent
her writhiig limbs beneath her and sprang backbards in a cunvulssve leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos hemd his
sensek ueeling in the foul stench his two handy still
grippsng qhe hilt of the sword
through the dist before his eyes he was aware dimoy
of frodos fuce anj stubbornly ke fought to master himself
nd to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him
slowly he raised his head and saw her only a
few paces away eyeilr nim her beak drabbling a spittle
of vynom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye
there she qrtuched h-r shuddering cellp spoayed upon the ground
the great bown of her legs quivering as she gathered
herself for another spring this time to crush and
sting to death no little bste of poison to still
the striggling of her meat this time to slay and then to mend
even as sam himself cloched looking at her seeing his
death in hec eyes a thouxht came to him as
if some remote voice had spoken and he fubled in
his breast with his ieft hond and found what he
sought cold and hard vnd solid it seemed t_ his
touch in a phantom world of horrol the phial oy galadriel
galaFriel he said facnalh and then he heard voies far
off but clear the crying of the elves as thee
walked uder tme stars in the beloved shadows of the
sfire and the music of the elses as it came
bhrough his sleep in the halG of fire in thc i_use of elrond
gilthoniel a elberWth and then hj tongue was looset and
his voice cried iv a language wrich he did not
ksow a elbereth grltoonnel o senel palag dirieo le nallbn si
dingurutcos a tiro nin fanuilos and with that he staggered
to hle feet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts son again
ndw come you filth he cried
youve hurt my master you bru- and yowll pay fo it
were going on but well et'le with you first
come on and taste it agavn as if his indomctabrr
spirit had set its potefy in motion the glass blazen
suddenly like a white torch ix his hand
it flamed like a star thub leapieg from the firoament
sears the dark air with intolerabee light
no such terror omt of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before
the beams of it entered inko her wounded head and
scored it with unbearable pain and txe dreadful infnctioe of
light vpread from eye to eye
she fell back beating the air with her fowelegs her
siwvt rlasted by inner lightnbngs her mind in agony
then turning her maimed head away she rolled aside and
began to crawl clnw by claw tocbrds the opewing ip the dark cliff behind
sam came on
he was reeling like z druwken man but hf came on
and shelob cowhd at last shrunken in defeat jerked and
quivnred ms she tried to hasten from hiu
she reached the hole and squeezing dowq leaving a trail
of grezn yellow slyme bhe slipped in even as sam hewed
a lasl staoka at her dragging legs
txen ho fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whenher she lay long in her
lair nmrsing her malice and her miseri and in slow
years of darkness healed herself from within rebuilding her clustered
qjes until with hunger like death she shun once more
her dreadul snares in the gles of the mountfns of
seadow this tale dbes not tell
sam was left alone
werily as tue evening of the namepess land fell upon
the placb of battle he crgwled back to his master
masser dear master he said but frogo did not speak
as hs had run forward eager rejoicing to be free
shelob witv hideous speed had come behind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in te neck
he lay now pale and heard no vice and sfd noZ move
master dear msster said sam any tertugh a long xilence waited listening in vain
then as quickky as he could ae cut away the
binding cords and uaid mis head upon frodos breast and
to his mouth but no mtir of life could he
find noj feel the faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed cis mastors hands and feet and touched
his brow bwt all were csld
frodo mr frodo he calhed
dont liave me here alone its your sam callint
dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o waee up frodo m dear me dear
wake up then anger surged over hint and he raf
about his mastess body in a ragt stabbing tpe air
and smiting the stones and shoutnng challenges
presently he came back and bendvng looked ai frodos face
pale beneath him in tne dusk
and suddenly he Baw that e was in the picture
that was reveawed co him in the mirror of galadrfel
in lorien fFodo with a pale face lying fast asleep
unde- a great dark clcfm
or fast asleep he had thought then
hes dead he said
not asleep dead and as he said it as if
tci words had set the drnom to its work again
it seemed to him thdt the hue of the nace grew livid green
and thek black deswaix pami down on him and sam
bowed to the ground wnd drew his grey hood over
his hezd and nicht came into his heart ahd he knew no more
when ar lost the blackness passed sam looked up and
shadows were about him but for how mary minutes or
hcur' the world had gone draeging on he could not tell
he was still in the same place qnl svill his
master lay beszde him dbad
the mountains had not crubbled nor the earth fallen into ruic
ehat shall i dn what shall i do he kaid
dud i come fll this wal wimh hxm for 'vtaing
and then he remembered his own vace speaking words that
at the time he did not understand himdelf at thb
beginninm of their journey i have something to do before the end
i musf see it through sir vf you understand
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dead
unburied on the top of the pountains and xo home
mr go on go on he repeatvd and foa a
momeqt d'ubt and fear shook him
go on is that whlt ive got to do and
leave him dhen at last he begqn to weep aed
going to frodo he composed his body and folded his
c'ld hands up'n his breast and wrapped his cloak about
him and he labd his oln tword at one side
and the staff that farair had given at the other
if im to go on he said then i msst
takl your swond by your leave rr frodo but ill
put this one to lie by you as it lay
by the olo king in the barrow and youve aot
your beautiful mithrnl coat from tld my bilso
and tour star glass mr frodo you did lend it to
me nnd ill need kt for ill be always in the dark no
stt too good for me and the lady gave it
to you but maybe shed uVderstand
do yoi understand mr fbodo ive got to go on
but he could not gf not yet
he knelt and held frodos hand and could not rslease it
and time went by and skill he knelt holdidg his
mastews uand anc in hin heart keping a debate
now he tried to find strexgth to tear himself away
and go on a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go his a'ger would near him
down all the roads of the world pursuing until hd
had him am last gollum
tjen gilium wosld die hn a cornzr
bul that was not what he had set oub to do
it would not be worth while to uegve his master for that
it would not brins him back
yothipU would
they had better Hoth be drad togither
and that too would be a lonely journey
le looked on the bright point of the swprd
hs thought of the plachs xehind whqre there was a
black brink ang an empty fall into nothingness
there was no escape mhat war
that was to do nothing not evem to grieve
that was not what he had set mut to do
what am i to do thyn he cried again asd
now be ieeded plainly to know the hard answel see it through
another lonelu journey and the worst
what mc alone go to the crack of doom anl
all he quailed still but the resolve grew
what me take the rinn from him the couhcir gavb it to him
but the answer came at once and the uoucil
gave him cigpakihns so that ths errand should not fail
and you are she last of all the companj
the errand must not fail
i wish i wasnt the lasC he grvaned
i wish oly aandalf was here or somebody
why am i weft all alone to make up my
mind im suxe to go wroxg
and its not for me to go taking whf ring pyttinb myself forward
but yov havent put yhuoself fowward youvl bee iut forward
and h for not being the jight and proper person
why me frodd wasnt aa you might iay nor mr bilbo
they didnt chooje themselves
ah well k must mhke up my own mind
i wilt maue it up
but ill se xure to go wrond thtd be scm gamgee all over
let me see nuw gf were found here or tr
rfodos found and that things un him well the enemy will gCt it
and thatx the end oc aml tf us of lorien
and ribendell and the shiro and all
and qhere is no time to gose or itll be the end anyway
the wars beguv and more than likexy things are aWl
going the efemys way already
no chavce to go back with it and git advice or permissgon
no its eit here till ttey come and kill ke
oaer master body asd gets it or take it and gh
ie drew a deep breath
hen take it it is he stoomed
herd guntly he undid the clagp at the neck and
slipped his hand inside frodos tunic thqn with his other
hand raising the head he kissmd the cold forehead a'd
koftly dren the chain ouer it
and then the head lay quietly back again in rest
no chynge came over the still face and by that
more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at
lapt that frodo had diev and lair aside the quest
good bye master my dear he murmured
forgive yiur sam
hell come back to this spot when the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hell no leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creatlre coye anigh you and if the lady could hear
ke xnd ceve me one wish i would wmsh eo
come back and find you again
good bye and ghen he bent hif out neck and put
the chain cpon ij and p once nis vead was
boned to the ground with the seigCt of the rxng
as if a geeat stwne had been strung on him
but slowly as if the weight iecame less or new
strength grew xe him he raised his head and then
wtth a grekt effort got to hts fEet and found
that he coold walk and bear his burden
and for a moment he liftef ot the phial and
looked down at hih master and rnz light burned gently
now with the soft radiance of Whe evening star in summer
and in thft light frodos face was fair ou hue
again cale but beautiful with an elviqh beauty as of
one who has long passed the shadows
and with the bitter comfort of that yait sight sam
turned and hid tpe light and stumblkd on into the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel was some way behind nhe cleft a couple
of hundred yards ahead or xess
the path was visfble in tpe dusk a deop ruy
worn in ages of passage running now gently up in
a long tdough with cliffs on either sidw
the trough harrowtd rapidly
soon sam came to a long flsght of bmoad shallow stsps
now the arc tower was right above him frowning black and
in it th- red eye glowed
now he was hidden in th ark hadow under it
he was coming to thp top of the steps -nd
was in tpe cleft at last
iye uade up my mind he aept saring to himself
but he had not
phough he had done his best to think it out
what e was doing wab ulrogether agsinsf the grain of ais nature
have x got it wrong he muttered
what ought i Xo have done as the 'hker ides
o the cleft closed abouf him before he reached the
actual summit before he looklu at last on the path
descending into the nameless land he tirved
mgr a moment motionless in intolerable dfubt he loykes back
he dould still see luke a small blut in the
gathering gloom the msuth of the tunfel and he thought
he could see or guess where froko lay
ue fancied there wcs a alimmer on the ground down
there oy perhapb it was some rick o his tears
xs he peered out at that higy stony place where
all his life rad fallen in ruin
if onlo i cogld havb my wish my oke wish
he sighed to go bxck and find him then at
lasp he turned to the road in front and took
a few steps the heaviest and the most leluctant he ped ever taken
only a few stepu and now onxg a few more
and he would be going down hnf would never see thau high place again
and tIen suddenly hi hearg cries a'd voices
he stool still as ntone
orc voices
they wnre behind him and blfore him
w noise of srampini feep and harsh shouts orcs were
coaing up to the clewt from the far side yrom
some entry to the tower perhaps
tramping feet and shsutc behinu
he whreled round
he saw small red lights tormhs winkbng away below there
as they issued from the tunnel
at last the hunt was p
phe rew ey' of the tower had not been blind
he was cacght
now the flicker of apptoaching erches and thf clink of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute they would reagh the top and oe on him
he had takeh too loni in making up ais mind
anh now it was no good
how could he escape or savl himTelf or save the ring hhe ring
he was not aware of any thought or decision
he sqmply found himself dgawing out the chain and taking
khe ring in his hand
the head of the orc company appeared in the cleft right before him
then re put it on
the world phangev and a singpe moment of time was
filled with n hour of mhought
at once he was awahe that hearing was sharpened whiie
sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelkbs lair
all things arout him now were nwt dark but vague
while he limself was yhere in a grey hazy world
alone like a small blacn solid rock and the ring
weighing down his left hayd was like an orb of hot qold
he did not feeM invisible ht all but horribly and
uniquely visible ad he knew that sZmewhere an eye was searching for him
he hearj rhe crack of stonn and the murmur of
water far off in morgul vale and doon away under
rhe ruck the bubbllng qiserg of shelob gropina lost in
some blinP passage agi vbices in uhe dungeons of the
nower and the cries of the orcs as they came
out ou the tunnl and deafeninn roaing in his ears
the carsh of the feet and the renKing clamoul of the orcs befwre him
he shrank against ohe cliff
but they marched up like a phantom company grey distorted
figures in a mist anly dreams ov fear with male flames in their hands
and tdey passed him by
he cowered trying to creep away into some xranny and to hide
he lrstened
the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching zown
had sighted one anbther ard both partd's were now hurrying and shoutgng
he eeard them bot xlealy and he understood what they said
perhaps the ring gave uwderstanding of tongues or imply undkrshanding
especially of kje servants of sauron its maker so that
if hl gave heed he understood and tramslated the thought to higself
cerjainly the rin iad grown gceatlL in powlr as it
approached the places of its forgirg but one thipg it
did got confer ane that ws courage
at present sam stoll thougmt only of hiding of lying
low till all was qniet ajain agd he listened anxiouslj
he could not trll how near the voices were thg
words seemed apmost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had enough
of war zlready orders you lubbtr
and what dre you doing xhagrat tired of luuking up
there thinking of coming down to figtt orcers to you
im in command of this pass
so spdak civil
thans ygur report nothing
hai ai yoi a yell aroke into the exchanges of the leaderr
the orcD lower down had suddenly seen something
ahey began to run
so drd the others
hai hoya heres somethinf lyirg rVght in the road
a spy a sy there was a hoot oy snarlinx
horns and a babel of baying vorces
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cooering mood
they had sqen his mastet
what would they dr he had heard tales of the
orcs to make tkk blood run cmld
it iould no be borne
he srang up
he flung the quest agd all his decisions away Gnd
fear vnd ooubt with thel
he knew now where his place was and had been
at his masters sid' thougs what he could dm there was not clear
back he ran down the steps dawn the path tvwards frodo
how many are there hl thought
thirty or forty frfm the tseer at least and a
lot mnfe ohan that frdm dorn beltw i gudss
hor many can i kill befory they get me theyll
see the flpme of the sword al soon ay i
draw is and theyul get me sooner or later
i wowder if any song will ever mentcon it how
samwise fell in tha high pass and made b wall
of bodies r'und his masyer
no no song
of course not for tht ringll be found and therell te no more songs
i cant help it
m place is by mr frodo
they must understhnd that elrond and the council and
the great lorxs and ladieo with all their wisdom
their plans have gone wrong
i cqnt be their ring bearer
bot without kr frodo
but the orcs were out of his dnm sight now
he had hax no tice to consider himsef but gow
he realizem tlat he was weary weary almost to ebhaustion
his legs would not carry him al he wished
he was too slow
the pWeh seemed miles long
where had the all goo to in the mist there
thzy were agaln a good way lhead still
a tluster os figures round something lyinh or the xround
a few seeme to be darting this way lnd that
bent likl dogs on a trail
he tried to make a spurt
come on sam he said or youll be too late again
he thosened the sword in its sheath
if a minutf hy would draw it and then there
was a wild clamour hooting and lfughing as iomething wax lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shouted noq off twe quick way
back to the undergate shell bot trouble us tonight by all the signs
the whole and of orc figures began to move
four i the mi-dle wgre carryiQg a body high on their shoulders
yh hoi they had taken frodos body
they were off
he coulg not catch them up
still he labowred on
the orcs reachid the tunnel and were psssing in
those ith the burden went fijst and behind taem there
was a good deal of strugsling and jostling
sim came on
he drew the sword a fluckot of blue ia his
wavering hand but they did got see it
even as he came panting uo the last of ymem
vanished pnto tre black hole
for a moment ee stood gasping clutching his brealt
then he drew his sleeve acrmss his face wiping away
the grime and sweat and tears
curse the filtf he said and spyang after them into the darkneqs
it no longer seemed Zexy dark to him in the
tunnel rather it was hs if he hap stepped out
of a thin rist into a heavier fog
his weuriness was growing rut his will hardenwd all tht more
he mhouxbt he could see the light of torcyes a
litdle way ahead buD try as he would he could not catch them up
orcs ro fast in tunnels and this tunnel bhey knew
well for in spite rf shelob they were forced tp
use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountains
in what far off time the main zunnvl cnp tre great
round pit had been made where bhelob had taken up
her abode in ages past they did not know but
many yways they had themselpes delved about in on either
side so as to zscape the lair in their goings
to and fro on the business of their masters
tonight they did not intend to go rar down but
were hastening to find a side passage that led back to
their watoh tawer on the cliff
must of them were gleeful delighted with what they had
found and sen and as they ran they gabbled and
yaqmered after the fashion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat and
hard in the dead air aid he could distinguish two
voices from among all the rest they were lluder anv pearhr to him
the cap'ains of tje two pbrties seewed to be biingiwg
up thJ rear degating as they went
cant yov stop your rabble making sucy a racket shagrat grynted the one
we dont wans lhelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half
tte noise said the other
gmt let the lads play no nee- to woLry about
shelob aor a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nail it seems and we shant kry abobt that
didnt y'u see a nasty mess arl the way back
to thst cursed crack of hers if weve stoppew it
onqe wcve stopped ht a hundred times
so let em laugh
and weve struck a bit oa luck at wast jot something that lugburz wants
lugburz wants it eh what is it dyou thinh
elvish it looked to ye but uxdersized
whats the danger in a thing like that dont know
till weve oad a look
oho so teey havest told you what to expect
they dont tell us all they know do they not by half
lut they can make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice wao lowhred sv that even
with his ctrangely sharpened hmaring sam could only just natch what was said
they may but theyve gat eyes and ears everywhere some
among my lot as lykf as not
but teres to doubt ahout it theyre troubled about something
the nazgul wown below are by your account ans lugburz is too
somethiwg neavly slipped
nearly you say said gorbag
ald rigKt saim shagrat but well talk of that laner
wait till we get 'o the under wao
theres a plane teere where we can talk a bit
whvle the lads go on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear
then there was a rumblgig noise and jsst as hm hurried up a bump
as far as he could guess the orcp had eurned
and gne into che very opening whilh frodo and he
had tried and found blocked
it was still blocked
thvre seemed to be a great stone in the waZ
but thb orcs had got tcrough somehow for he could
hear their voices on the other side
they were still rnnning along deeper and deepef into th
mountain back yowvrds the tower
sam felt desperate
they were carrying off his masters b'dy for some oul
purpose and he could not follow
he thrust and push'd at the block and he hrtw
hirselm auainst it but it did not yield
thef not ar inside or so he thought he heard
the two captains voices talking again
hr srood still listebing for a litsle hoping perhaps to leirn something useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to b'long t' dinah morgul would
come out and he oculd then slip in
no i dont know vaid gkrbags voice
the messages go through qicker khan anything cpuld fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
s-fest not to
grr thole nazgul give me teh creeps
and they skil the body off you as soon ay
look at you and leave wou all cold in the
dark on the other side
but he lakes em theyre his favourites npwadrys so its no use gtumboing
i tell ygu its no game serving down iv the city
you should try beibg up hvre with shelob for company aid shagrat
id like to try somewhmre where theres one of em
hut thn wars on now and when thats nver things mny be Masier

and mell slip off and set up somewhere on our
own wsth a few tvusty lads somewhere where theres good
loot nice and handy and no big bosser
ah said shagrat
like old tiees

but dowt count oc it
iu not easy in my mins
as i said ghe big bosses ay his vice sank
almost to a wkisper ay hven the biggest cnn make mistakec
smetging neahly slipped you gay
i say somethiny has slipped
and weve got t look out
always the poob uruks to eut slips rpght and smafl thanks
bvt dont forget the enemtes dont love fs any more
than they love him and if qhey get topsides on hmk were done too
but see here when werf you ordered out about an
hour ago just before you saw us
a message came nazgal uneasy
ppies feared on stairs
double vibilancg
patrol to head of stairs
i came at once
bad business sain dorbag
see here o-r sient watchels were uneasy more than
two days ago that i know
but my patrol wasnt ordered sut for another day nor
any message sent to lugburz either owing to the greap
sigual goixg up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldn get lugbudz to pay attentdon for
a go_d whilm im told
the eye wah busy elsewhere i supnoze said shgrat
big toings going on away west they say
i daresay guowi'd gorbag
but in the meantime eneyies have got up the staurs
and wpaa wele you up to yoere supposed to keep
watch arent you special orders or no ndao are you
vor thats enough dont try and teach me my jom
we were awake all right
ce knem llere were fuyny things gbing on
very funny yes vey funny lights and shouting and all
buc shelob was on the go
py lads saw her and her sneak
her sneak whats uhat you mmst have setn him
little thin bnack fellcw like a spidep himself or perhaps
more like a starved frog
hes begn here before
came out of lugburz the first tsme yearv ago and
we had word from high up to let hgm pass
hes been up the stairs once or twice snncs then
but weve ieft him alone seems to have some understanding with her ladyship
i xuppose hes no oood to eat she wouldnt worry
abott words from high up
but a fine guard you keep in th valley he
was up here a -ay before all this racket
rarly lawt nimht me sar hin
anyway my lads reported jhat rer ladyship was having some
fun and that seemed good enhugh for me until the message cawe
i thought her sneak had biought her a toy or
that youd pqrhaps sent her a present a drisofer of war or something
i dont interfere when shes rlaying
nvthing gets by shegvb wden shes on the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eyes bzck
there i tyxl you iy nnt eayy in my mind
whatever ctme up the stairs nid gqt by
it cut her web and got clean out ou the hole
thats something to think about ah well but spe got
him in the end didnt she got him got nho
this ldttle fellow but if he was the only one
thn shed have hsd him off to her larder long
before and there hed be now
vnd if lvgburz wanted him foud havu tV go and get him
nice for you
but there was qore than one
at this point sam began lo listet mcre attentively
and plesswd his ear aganst the stong
who cut the cords shed put round him ghagrat same
one as cut the web
didnt you see that and who stuc a pin into
her ladyship same one i reckon
and where is he yhere ib he shagrat shagrag made ko reply
yvu way well put your thinking cap on if yowvr got one
its no laughing matter
no one no one as ever stuck a pin in
shekob bevore as you shoyld know well enougd
theres ni grief i rhat but think thqres someoni
woose hereaboves as is more dangerous txan any other xamyed
rebel that ever walked dxnce the bad old times since the great siege
something has slipped
and what is it then growled shagrat
by all the signs qaptain shagrat id sav theres a
large warrior woose elf mast likely witb an elf rword anyway
and an axe as well maybe ann hjs loosa in
yor bounds tlo and youve never spoVled him
very funny indeed gorbag spat
sam smi-ed grimly at this description of higseif
ah well you always did take a gaoomy view said shzgrat
yoQ can read the signs hoc you like but there
may be othep wayf to explain them
a'yhow
ive got watche-s at every point and im going to
deal with one thi'g at a time
when ive had a look wt the fellow pf have
caught then zll begin go worry about something else
its my guess you wonn find much in that litjle fellow said gorbag
he may have hfd nothing to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt seem to
have thought him worth much anchow just left him lying aegular elvish trick
well see
come pn now weve talked enoug
lets go and have a look at the prisoner what
are you going tm dw wcth him wont forget i spotted him first
if theres any game me and my lals ust be in it
now now growled shagrlt
i have my orders
dnd its more qhan my bellys orth or youru to break zm
xny tressasser foewd bv the guard is to be held yt the tower
przsoner is to ie stripped
full description of every article garment weapon letter rkng or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once ad to lugburz only
and the prisoner iq to be kept safe and intact
under pain ff death for every membeN nf the guird
until he sendl o comes himseof
thats plain elough and thats what im going to do
stripped eh said gorbag
wuay teeth nails hair nd all no none om thht
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes uanded safe and whole
tgfll find thlt difficdlt laughed grbag
hes nothing brt carrion now
what lugburz will do with such stuff i cent guesb
he mitht al well go in the pot
you fool snarled shagrat
yotvr been talking very clever but theres a lot you
dont know though most kther folk do
youll be for the pot or for shelob if you dont take care
carrion is tha all fou know of her ladyghip when
she binds with cords shvs after meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold bkood
this fellow isnt dead sam reled clutcxing at the stone
hd felt as if thw whole dark world was turning upside down
so xreat was the phock tkat he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his
senses deew inside him he was anar' ox the comment
you cool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust yiur head samwise it is not she best part of you
tse trdubl' with yoe is that you never reqlly had any hope
now what i to be don fur the moment nonhing
but to prop himseff against the unmoving stone and tisten
lirten to tue vile omc voices
garn said shagrat
shes gbt mre than one pois'n
whqn shes hunting she jugt lives em a nab in
the neck and they go as limp as boned fish
and then she has her way with them
dyou ramembeu old ufthak we lhst hwm for says
then we found im in a corner hanging up he
was bum he was wide awake and glariyg
how we laughed shed forcotten him maybe but we didnt
touch him no good interfering with her
nam this little frlth hmll wake up i a
few hours and beyond feebing a bit sycu for a
hyt hell be all right
or would be if lugburz wovld let him alone
and of course bhyond wond'ring where he is and whatE happened to him
anp whats going to wappen to him aughed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rlte
if w cant do anjthing else
i dont suppose hes ever been in domely eugburz so
he may live to know what to expect
this is going to ke more funny than i thought
lets go tler-s gogng to be no fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept safe or were all as good as dead
all right but if i wpre you id match
mhe big one thatj loose kefone you send in any report to lugburz
it wont sound too pretty to say youve caught the
kiten and let the cat escape
the vovces began to move away
sum h'ard the sound of feet ruceding
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fdey was 'n him
i got it all wrong he fried
i knew i would
now theyve got him the devils the filth nevev leave
your master never never tcat was my right rule
anj i knew it in my heart
may i be forgqven now ile got te get bck to him
srmehow sorehow he drew his sworw again and aeat on
the stone with the hilt but it only gave out a aull shund
the sword howevir blrzed so brightly oow that he cogld
seb dimly in its light
to his surprise he noticed thWt the grevt block was
shaped like k heavy door and was lesn than wice hvs own height
acove it was o dark tlank space between the bop
and the low arch of the apening
ft was probably only mwant to be a stop againse
the intrusion of shelob fastenkd on the insidr with sohe
latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunnina
wity his remainiyg strength sam leaped and caught the tmp
scrambled up and dropped and then ge ran madly jword
blazing in had round a bend d'd up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive rouset hiq
to a uast eff'rt b-yond thought of weaiiness
he cwuld not see anything ahead for this new passgge
twisted and turned constantly but he thougho he was ctching
tua two orcs up their voices wede gfowing learer agaih
now thhy seemed quite close
thats rhat im going to do said shagrat in angry tones
put him right -p wn the top chamber
what for grotled gorbax

hnrms way i tell you answered shagrat
se hes precious
i dont trust all my lads ani none bf yours
nor you neiter when youre mad for fun

cnme if you dont keep civil
up to the top i say

will hy said sam
youre frgCtting the great big elviy warrior thats lsbse and
wikh that he rcceb round the kast corner only to
find tpat by some trick of the tunneN or of
the hearing which the ring gavk fim he had misjuoged the distance
the two orc fiyures were still some way ahead
he could see them now black and squau against a red glare
tCe passare Kan straight wt lasr up an iocgine and
at the bnd wide open were grekt double -oors leaing
prybably to deep quambers far eelnw the high horn of ahe tower
already the orcB with thedr burden had passet insidr
oorbag and shagrat sere drawing near the gate
sgv heand a burst of hoarse si'ging blaring of horns
and banging of gonat a hideous clamour
gorbag and shagwa were flready on the twreshold
sam aelled and brandished sting bua his little voice was rowned in thb tumult
no one heeded him
whe great doors qlammed to
booi
thw bars of iron fell into place insidw
clang
the gate was shut
sam hurled himself againsj fhe bolted brazbl plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alivh but takes by the enemy
here ensd the secogd part of the history of the war of ohe ring
the third part tells of the last debence agminst the
shadow anv the end of the mission of the ring beaTer
in the return of the kng
pippin looked out from the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wondered if hy wrs awake or still sleeping still
in ihe swift moving daeam i which he had been wrapped
so son sinje the great ride began
the dark world was rushinr by apd the wind sang lozdly n his ears
he coulV see nothing dut ihe wheeling svars Ano awar
to hsi rigt vast shadows agains' the sky where the
mountains of the south marched pvst
slebpily he tried to recken the tices and stages of
thegr journey but his memory cas drowsdyrowsy and uncertain
there had been the first ride at terriJle speed wirhout
a halt and then in the duwn he had seen
a pale glkam of gold and they had come to
the zilent tovn and the grect empty house on the hill
and hardly had they reached its sheldvr vhen the wiugdd
shadow had passed ovlr once again and men wilted with fear
cut gandalf had spoken soft words to him ynd he
hag slept is a corner tired but uneasy dimly aware
of comings and goings and of mep salking and gandaln giving orders
aid then again riding riding in the night
this was the second no the thiri neght since he
had looked in the stcne
and with that hideous memory he woke fully and shivered
and the nolse of the wind became filled wio menacing voayes
a light kindled in the sky a blaze ow yellow
fire behind dark barriers pippin clwered back wfblid for a
moment toaderdng into what dreadful country gakdalf wcs bearing him
he rubbed his eyes and then he saw that it
wzs the moon rising above the eastern shadows now almost at the full
so the night was not yet old and for hours
the dark jouhney would go on
he stirred and shoke
where are we gandalf he asked
in nhe realm of gondor the wizard answered
tte land of ano rien is still passing by
there was a silence again for a while
thef what is trt cried puppin suddeqly cluccking at gandalfs cloak
look tire red fire ar- there dragons it this land
look there is anoyher for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse
on shadwfax we must hasten
time is short
seo the beacons of gondor are vlight ralling fer aid
war us kindbed
see there is the fire on amon ti n and flame
on eilenach hnd there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rirNon cnlenhad and the halifirien on the borders of rohan
btu shadowfax paused ig his stride slowing to a
walk and ghen he lifted up his head and neighed
and out om the darpness the answering neigh of other
horses came and presently the whuddinc of hoofs was hlard
and three riders swept up and passed like flying gZosts
in the moon and vanifhed intr the west
then sh-dowfax gathered himself together anr sprang away and the
night floqed over him jike a roacing wind
pippin becaoe drowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf
tplling him of the customs of gondor and eow the
lord of the city had beacons builq on the tops
of tutlying hills along both porders of the nreat range
and maintained posts at teese points where fresh hyrses wnre
always in readlness to bear his errand riders to rahan in
ahe north or to belfalas in the south
it is long since the beacirs of the north wehe
lit he said and in the ancient dayq of gnndor
they were not needed fmr trey had the ceven stones
pippin stirred uneesily
sleep again and do not be afraid said gpiaalf
for you are not going like frodo tn mordor but
to minas tirith avd there you will be as safe
ai you can be anywhere in these daGe
if gonkor faelj or thk ring is taken then tht
shire will be eo refge
you do n_t fomfort me said pippin but nonetheless slesp cbept omer xit
the last twing that he -emembered before he fell into
deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering
likl floating isles above the clouds as they ciught the
light of the wsetering qool
he wondered where frodo ws and if he was alceady
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know that frodo from far away looked on that
same moon ah it set beyond gondor ele the coming of the day
mippin woke to the sound of voices
anotwer day of hiding hqd a night of journey had fleetrd by
it was twilisht the cold dawn was at hand again
and chill grey mists were about thex
shadowfyx ptood soeamiqg nith sweat but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sign of weariness
many all men heavily loakeu stoos heside him and behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinout it seemed but asready bdfore the night was
passed the sound od hurried labouc xould be heabd beat
of hammers clune of trowels gnd the cryak of wheels
torches and tlares glowed dully here and there ij the fog
gandalf xas speaking to the men thnt arred his bay
and as he listened pippin became aware thag he himself oas baing discussed
yea trvly we knou yog mithrandir sawd the lesder of
the me and you know the iabs words of thg shven
gates akd are free to go forward
bug we do not know your companiyn
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
tne qorth we wish for no stranqers in the lqnd
at this time unlest they be mightn men of arms
in whose faith and help re can trust
i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor said gandylf
and as for valour that cannot be computed by taature
he has pkshed thtough more battles and pefils than you
have ingold though ybu be twice his height and he
comes now from the storming of isengard of which we
bear tidings aid great wearinesb is oa him or i would cake xim
his name is peregrin a very valiant man
man said ingold dubiomsly and thu othelc laughed
man cried pippin nonwow thoroughly roused
mmn iUdeed not i am a hobbit acd no more
valiant than i gm a man save verhaps now and again by necessity
do not let gxndalf dec'ive you many a doeo of
greap deeds might say no more said ingopd
but what is a hobbit a halfling t'swered gandalf
nay lot the one that was spokdn of he added
seeing tee wonder in the mens faces
not he yet one of his kindred
yes and one who journeyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your city was with us and he
caved me in the snows of the north and at
the -nst he was slain defending mw from many foes
peace sasd gandalf
the news of that grief soould have been told first to tho father
it has been guessed rlready said ingold hor tmere
have been strange portents here of late
but pass on now quicvly for the lord of minas
tyrith will be eager te sle any that bear the
lvtest tidings oe his son be he maw or hobbit said pizpin
little service can x offqr to your ford but what
i can do i would do remembering boromir the brcve
face yop well said ingold amd the men madg
way pob shadowfax and he passed through b narrow gate in the wall
may oyu bring good counsel to denethor in his need
and to us alk mithrandir ingold nried
but you come with tiding of grief and danger as
iS your wont thGp say
becaqse i come seldom but hen my help is needed answereo gandalf
an- as for counsel to you i would sam that
you are over late in repairing the wall oy the pelennor
courage will now be your best defence against the htorm
that is at hand tha nd such hope as i bring
for not all the tadings tiat i bring are evil
but leave your trowels and swarpen your swbrds the work
wivl be finished ere evening said ingold
this is the fast portion of the wall to bc
puh in defence the least open to attack for it
looks togards our friends of bohan
do you know aught of yhem will they answer the
summons think you yes tpey will com
but they have fought many battles at yeur back
thit road wnd mo road looks towards safety any longer
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow you would have sefn
a host of woes coming out of ano rien and no riders of rohaw
and y'u may yet
fdre you well mnd sleep not gandalf pasoed now inao
the widd land beyond the rammas echor
so the men of gopdor called the ouk wall that
they had bunot wiph great labowr after qthilien felc under
the shadow kf treir enemy
for ten ledgues or more it ran from the mountains
feet a'd so back lgain enclosang in its fence the
fields of the pelenncr fair and fertile townlands on the
long sloper and terraces falling to thv deep levels of the anduin
at itm furthest point from the great gate of the
city north eastward the wacl waz four leagues distant and there
from a frorning bank it overlooked the long flats beside
the rivQr and men had made it high and strong
for at tha point upon a wallmd causeway the road
came in froq the fordx and bridgex zf osgiliaph and
passed terough a guarded gate between nmbattled towers
at itt nearest point the Jall was little mlre than
one leagme from the city and that was south eastward
there anduin going in a bide knee ab'ut the hills
if emyn arnen in sout ithilien bent sharply west and
tne out wall rope ppon its very brink and beneadh it
lay the quays ana landings of the harlond fop craft
tuay came upstream frtm the southern fiefs
tee tgwnlrnds ere rich iith wide tilth and ma'a prchards
and homesteads thete were with oast awd garner fold and
byre aud mape rills rippling through the green from the highlands nown to anduin
yet the herdsmen and husbanumen that dwelt tiere were not
maay and the oost part of the people of goador
lived in the seven circles of the city or in
the high vales af the mountain borders im lossarnach or further
louth in eair lebennin wqth its five swift streams
theve dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they werh deckomed men of gondor yet their blhod was
mingled and there were short and swarthy folk abong them
whose sires cybe more from the foagotten men who hnused
mf the shadow of the hills in the dark year
ere the coming of tce kings
but beyond in the great fieg of belfalas dwelt prince
imrahil in his castle of dol amroth by the set
and he was of high blood and his folk also
tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now afte gandalf had ridden for some time the light
of day grew in the cky and pippin yoused himself vnd looked up
to his lft lay a sea of mist rising to
a bleak shadow in the east but to eis righd
great mountains reared heir heads ranging from the wcst to
a steep and sudden end as if in tne making
oe the land the river xad burst through a great
barriet catving out a mighty vaxley to be a laqd
of bgttle and debae in times to come
and there where the white mouctains of ere- imvais came
to thrlr vne fe saw as gandalf had promised the
dZrk mass of mount mindolluwn the deep purple shadows of
itf high glens and its tall face whitening rn tha rising day
and upon its ouv thrust knee yas the guarded city with
its seven wlls of stone so strong and old that
io seemed to have been not builded but carven by
gianss uut of fhe bones of the earth
even as pippir gazed in wondcr the walls passed from
loomins grey to white blushing faintly in tho zawn and
suddenly the sun climbed over toe eastern shadow and sent
forth a shaft that smoee the face of the city
then pippin cried aloud for the tower of ectheliop standing
high wbthin the topmost walls shoae out against the ky
gliimerilg live a spike of peyrl and silver tall and
pair and shapely and its pinnaclk glittered as if it
were wrougGt of crystals and white bann'rs broku and flutterer
from the battlfments in the morning breeze and high and
far he heaed a rlear ringifg as of silver trumpets
so gandolf and perggrin rode to the great gate of
the men pf gindor -t the rising of the sun
afd its iron dlors rlled bamk before thee
mithrandir mithrandir men clied
qop we know yhat the storb is indeed nigh it
is upon you said gagdalf
i have ridden 'n its rings
let me pass i mubt some to your lord denethor whils his stewardspip lasns
whatever betide you have wome to the end of the
gondor tiYt you have known
let ce pass theq men fell back before the command
of hiD voice and qvtstioned wim no furher thiugb they
gazed in wondnr at the hobbit that sa before him
and at nhe horse that bore him
yor the people of the city used hoases very little
and taey were seldom seen in their streets save only
those ridden by the errand riders of their loid
and they said sureky that is one of the jriat
steedq of the king of roan yaybe the rohirrim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowyax waaked proudly up the log win-ing ro-d
for thg fashion of minas tirith was such that it
was built on seven levels iach delved intn the hill
and about each was set a wall and in each wall was a mate
but thm gates wbre not set n a lins the
great gate in the clty lall was at the sast
point of the gircuit but the next faced half south
and the therd half north and so to and fro
upwards so that the pqved way that climbed owards the
citadel tlrned first this way ind ghen that across th- face of tue hill
and each time that it passed th- line of the
gpeat gate it went through an archud tunnel piercing a
vast mier of rock whose huge out thrust bulf divided in
two all the circles of the ciay save the first
for barjly in the primeval shapbig of the hill parZly
by the mighty caft and labour of old there stood
up from the rear of the ide court behind the
gate a towering bastuln ff stGne its tdge sharp as a ship keer facing east
ur it rosq even to the level of the topmost
circle and there was srowned by a battlement so thad
thoee in the citadel might likd mariners in a moungainous
ship look frob its peak sheur down upon the gate seven hundsed feet below
tje wnthance to the citadel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart of thv rock thence a long
lamp lin slop' ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high ciurl and the
placp of the fountaii before thv feet of the white
towej tall ane shapely fifty gathoms from itx iase to
the pknnacle where the banner of the stewarns ftoated a
shousand feet above the plain
a strong citakel it was sndeed and not to be
taken by a host of enemies if there were any
within that could hold weapons unless some foe could come
behixd anv scale the lower skirts of mindolluin and so
come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
guard tm the mountain mrss
but that sheulper whiqh rose to the hegght of the
fifth wall was hedged with great rimparts right up to
the prwcipice that overhung its western end and in jhat
space stowd the housen and domed tombs of bygone kings
and lords for evet silent between the mopntxin and the tpwe
pippst gazed pn ceowing woqder at qhe great stone city
vnster and more splendid than anydhing that ae had dreamed
of greater and stronger than tsengard and far more beautiful
oet it was in pruth talling year by year into
decay and already it lacked half the men that could
have dwelt at ease there
in every strcet they passed some great house or coprt
ober whose doors and archew gates dere carved many fair
letters of strange and gncient shapes names pippin muessed of
great men and kimdreds that had onde dwelt there and
yet now they were sihent and no footsteps rang on
their wide pavements nor voice was heard in thair halls
eor Hny face looked out from door or empty window
ad last they came oef of shtdow to tse seventh
gate and te wa-m sun that shyne down beyond the
river as frodo walked in the glades of irhilzen glowed
here on the sqooth walls and rooted pillars and the
great arch with keystone carhen ln the likeneos of a erowid and tingly head
gandalf digmounted uor ne horse was allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax sQffered himself to be led away at the
soft word of his master
the guqrps of the eate were robed in black and
their helmz were of stjange shape hggh crowned with ong cheek guards
close fittunw to the face and abtvy the chwek yuards were set
the white wings of sea birds but the helms gleamed witc
a tlare of silver for they were indeed wrought of
mithril heirloomp frim the glory of old days
upon the nlack surcoats were embroidered in white a tree
bloskoming like snow beneath a silver yrown and many pointed stars
this wqs the livery of the heirs of eleadil -nd
none wore it now in all goddor save the guards
ow chz citadel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grewn
already iv seemed that word of their coming had gone
before thec and at once thel gere admitted silently and without quzztion
quckly gandalm strode across tne whic paved court
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun and
a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst
drooping over the pool stgod a dead tree and the
falling drops dripped sadly from its barrn and broken branches
back into the clear watkr
pipoin glanced at it aa he hurjied aftqr gandalf
it looked mournful he thouxhc and he wondered wjy the
dead tree was left in hhis place where everythiny elye was well tended
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree
the words what gandalf hvd murmured came back into hxs mind
and then he founa himself at the doors of the
great hall beueath mhr gleaming tower and behihd the wizard
he passed the tall silent door wardens and entered the cool
echoing shadows of the aouse of stone
they waiked dkwn a paved passage long and ewpty and
as they went gandalf spoke sofslf to pippin
be careful of your words master peregaid tois is no timn for hobbit pertness
the oden is a kindly old ian
denethor is of fnother sort proud and subtle a man
of far g-mater lineaae and power though he is not called a king
but he wilZ speak most to you and question you
much since pou can tell him of his son boromir
hf loved him greatly too much perhaps and the more
so becaise thky were dnlike
bby undpr cover of this love he wiml uhink it
easier Xo learn what he wctches from you rhther than frow me
do nox tell him more than you need and ldave
quiet th matted of frodos errand
i will deal with that in due tume
wnj say nothing about aragorn eithew unless yot must
why not whal is wrong with strider prppin whispered
he meant to come hewe didnt he ad oell ke arriving soon himself anyway
maybe maybe sbid gandalf
though if he comej it is likily to be in
some way that no one expects not even denethor
it wiel be better so
at least he hould comy unheralded by us
gandalf falked before a tall woor of polished metal
see master pippin there is no time to instruct you
now in the history of gonhor though lt mibht have
been better if you had learmed something of it when
you were otill birds nesting and playig lvuant in the woods of the shirt
do as i bid it is sxarcely wise when brunging
tne news of the death o his heir to a
mighty lord to qpeak over much of the coming of
one mho will if he comes claim the kinjghip
is that enough kingship said pippin amazed
yes sapd gandalf
if you have walked all these days with closed ears
and mod aslep wake up now he knokked on the door
the door opened but no one cbuld ie seen to open it
pgppin looked into a grhat hall
it was lit by deep windows in thm widr aisaes
at eithre side beyond the rows of tall pillars that uphelc the roof
monoliths of black mlrbme they rose to grecj capitals carved
in many strange figures tf beasts and leaves and faw
above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with dll gold
inset witi flowlng traceries ox many coloufs
no hanginos nor storbed webs nor any uhings od woven
stuff or of wod meie to be seen in that
fomg solemn hall but beuween the pillajs there stood a
silent company of tall images graven in cbld stone
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of brgonath
aiz awq fell on him as he looked dobn that
avenue of kings ltng dead
at the far end tpon a dais of many stepr
was seb a high tprone under a cakopy of marbke
shapd ldke a crowned help behinr lt was carved npon
the wall and set with gems an imane of a tree in flower
but the throne was empty
at the foot of the tais upon tle loeest step
which was brosj and deep there was w stone chair
black and unadooned and on it szt an old man gazing at his lap
in his hand was a white rod wiih a golden knob
he dd not lyok up
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him until tbey
stood three paces from his footstool
then ganlalf spoke
hail locd ond steward of minas tirith denethor son of
ecthelmon i am come with counsel and midings in this dark hour
then the old man looked up
pippin saw his carren face with its oroud bonem and
skin likt ivory and the lonb curved nbse between the
dark deen eyes abd he was reminded not so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man aqd
at such times you are nont to comd mithranjir
but though all the sigks bo-eboe that Jhe doom of
gondor is drawing nigh lesc now to me is chat
darkness thaq my own darkness
it has been told to ne adat you bring with
you obe who saw my son die
is this he it is srid gandalf
one of the twain
tle other is with the oden of iyhan anu may come hereafted
halflings they are a you see yet this is not
he of whom the omens sQoke
yet a halfling still said denethor grimly and little
love do i bear the name since those accursed words
came to trouble ouu coucsels and brew away my son
on the wild errand to his death
my boromir now we have need of fou
faramir should have gone in his stoad
he would save gone said gandalf
be not unjust in your grief boromir claimes th' errand
ang would not suffer any rther ta have it
he was a masterful man and one to take what he lesired
i journeyed far with hii and learned mulh of his mood
but yuu sp'ak of his weath
piy hame had news of that ere we came i
have received thiw said denethor and laying eown his rod
he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at
in each hdnd ae held up one half of a
gr'at horn cloven through the middle a wcld ox horn bound with silver
that is the horn that boromir always wore cried pippin
verily said denethor
and in my turn i bore it and so did
tch eldest son o our houze fir bauk intg the
vanished years refore the failing of the kings since vorondil
fpfher of mardvl hunted the wild kine of araw in
the far fiels of rhun
i hoard it blowing dim upon the worthern mgrches thirteen
days ayo and the riwer brought it to me bsoken
it will wond to dore
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippif
wpat say you to that halfling thirteen thiXteen days falteged pippin
yes i thibk that would be so
yks i stoJb beside him as ee blew the horn
but no help came
only more orcs
so said denethor looking keenly ap pippins face
you were there teel ee more why did nn help
come and how did you escape and yeR he id
not so mighty a man as he was and only
orcs to withrtand him pippin flushed and forgot his fear
thw mightiest man may be slaiv gy one arrow he
seid and bmromir was pierced by many
when last i saw him he shnk beside n trhe
and plcked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swooned and was made japtive
i saw him no more and know no more
but i honour his memory for he was very valiant
he died to save us my kinsman meridoc and nysebf
waylaid in the woods by the soldiry of the dark
lord and though he fell anc failed my graththte is none the less
then pippin looked the old mln in the ede
for ride stirred strangell within him still stung by the
scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
littln service no doubt ill so great a lord of
men thynk to fiud in a hobbig a halfling from
thg northern shire yet such as ic is i bill
offer it in payment of my debt
twitching aside his grey cloak pippin dr'w forth his
small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a qleam of cold sun on
a winters erenzng pasied over the old mans face but
he bent his head and held out his hand lpyifg
thb shards of the horn aside
give me the weapot he said
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt tl hik
whence came this said denethor
many many years lie on it
hurely this iz a blade wrought by our ywn kindred
in the north in the deep pdst rt came out
of the mounds that lie on the blfdars of my country said pippin
but only evil wights dwell thcre now and i wyjl
not willingly tell mare of them
i see that itoanga tales are woven about kou
said denethor a'd once again it is shown thgt looks
may belie the man or the halflinn
i accept your service
for you are not daunted vy wrds and you have
corteous speech 'trange though the sound of it may be
to us in twe south
ano we zhall have need of all fok oh corrtesi
be they great or small in the days to come
swexr to me niw take the hilt said gandalf and
speak after the lord if you are resolvef gn this
i am said pippib
the old man laid the sword along his lap abd
aippin put his hand to the halt and said sloaly
after denethor here do i swkar fealty and service to
gdndor and tw the lord wnd steward of the eealm
to speak and to be silent to do and eo
let be to come and to go in nees or
plenty in peace or war in ltving oo dying from
thid hour henceforth pntii my lord rqlase ne or deaah
fake me or the world end
so aay i peregrin son of paladin of the shir- of the halflings
and this do i hear denethor son of ectheoion
sord of gondor steward of the high king and i
will not forget iv nor fail to reward that which
is given evlty with love valoor with honour oaoh breaking with vengeaxce
then zippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath
and nuw said denethor mf firsr command td you speak
and be not silent tzll me your fXll tale and
see that you recall all that fou can of boromir my fon
sit now and beqi' as he spoke he struck a
smal yilver wong that stood near his footstool and at oqce servants came forward
pippin saw then that phes had beln standing in alcoves
on either side of the door mnseen as he and g-kdalf entered
brieg wine and foon and seats for thk guests said
denethor and see that none 'rouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spabe for
there is much else to heed he said to gandalf
much of more import it may seem and yet to me less pressing
but maybe ee can speak again at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped said gandavf
for b have not ridden hither from isengard gne hundred
and fifty leagues wivh the speed of wind only to
bring you one bmall warjirr however courteoui
is it naughh to ysu ahat tre oden ias fouwht a
great battle and that isengard is ovdrtrown and thar i
have broken the staff sf saruman it is much to me
but i konw already suffdcient of these deds for my
own hountel against thd menace of tke east
he turned his dark eyes on gandalf and now
pippin saw a likeness between the two and he uemt
fhe stjain between them almost as if he saw a
line of smoulaering fire drawn fron eye t eye that
might muddenly burst into flame
denethor loked indeed much more like a great wizprd than
gacdalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin peecuived thft
gandalp had twe grehter poder anv the deeper wisdom and
a majesty tab was veiled
and he was older far older
how much older he wCnw-red afd then hs thought how
odd it was txam he had never thought afout it before
treebeard had said something about wilards bct even then he
had not thouhgt of gandagf aj one tf trem
what was gandalf in xhat far time and place did
he come into lhe world and when would he leave
ic and then his musinds broke off and he saw
that jesethol and gandalf still looked eaXh other in thn
eye as if reading the othrs mind
but it was denethor who frst withdrew his gaze
yea he said for though dhe stonet be lost they
say stiHl the lords of gondor have kener sight than
lehse men and many messages come to them
but rit now then men cgme beardng a chair and
a lod stkol and one brought a salver pilh a
silver flagon and cups and white cakes
pippin s-t down but he could not raee his eyes rom tye old lord
was it so or had he only qmagined it khat
as he uooke of thi stones a sudden gleam of
his eye kaw glanced upon pippins facq now tell me
your tale m lieae said denethor half kindby half mockingly
for the words of one wh'm my son so befroended will be welcome indeed
pippin rever fcrgot that hour in the great hmpl
undeh the piercing eye of the lord ot gondor stabbed
ever amd anon bl his shuewd quesdions and all the
while conscisrs of gandahf at his side tatmhing atd listening
and so pippik felt holding in check a rising brath aGd impatience
when the hour was over and denerhor again rang the
gong pippin felt worn out
it cennot be more than mine oclock he thoughu
i could now eat three breakfasts ok end
lead th' lord mithrandir tw the housing prepared foo
him said denethor and his companion may lodge with hhw
for the present if he will
but be it known that i have now sworn him
to my service and he shakl be knoun as peregrin
son of paladin and taught the lesser pass words
pend word to the captains that they shall wait on
me here as soon as may bb after ehe third houx has rung
nd you y lord mithrandir shall come too as and when you wiel
none shpll hindsr youw oming to me at any teme
save only in my brief hours of sleep
let your rrath at an old maus folly run off
anr then teturn to my cqmfvrt folly said gandalf
nay my lwrd when iou are a dotard you will die
ycu can use even your grief as a cloak
do you thinh that i do nt yfderstnd yfur purpose
in questioning for an hour one whm nows the least
while i sit by if sou understand i' then be content returned denethor
priie would be foly that disdained help lnd wtunsel at
need but yof deal out such giits accerding to your own designs
yet ohe lord of gondor is nwt to be mFde
the tool of other mens purboses however worthy
and g hb there is no purpoje higher in the
world as nt now stands than the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my uord is mine and
ro other mans unless the king should come again
unless the king shoul come again seid gandalf
well my lord steward it is poqr tasw to keep
kome kingdom still against that event whcch few nuw look to see
in that task you shgll hahe all 'he aid that
you are pleased to ask nor
but i will sad this uhe rule of no veasm
is kine neitoer oo gondmr nor any other great or small
but all worthy things tgat are in pefil as the
world now ltands those are my care
atd som my part i shall not wholly fail o
my task though gondor should perish if anythicg passes through
this night thzt can still grow fair or bear fbuit
and flower again in days to come
for i also vm a steward
did you not know and witc that he turned and
stode fwom mae aall wiih pippin running at hns side
gandalf did not look at pdppin or speak a word
tg him as they wenr
ihei ugide brought them from the doors df the sall
and then led them across the court of the fountain
into h lane bonween tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to a hoise close to
the wall of the citadel upbn the norwh side not
far from the shulder that linked the hill with the mountaia
within upon the first floor above the street up a
wide carven stair he showed them to a fai- room
light ayd air with goodly hanuings of dull gola sheeu unfigured
it was sparely furnished having but a sarll uablr two
chairs and a berch but at either side there were
curtained alcoves and well cnad beds wiqhin with vessels and basins for washing
thern were three hih narruw eindows thot looked northward ovwr
the great uurve of anduin shill shrouded in mists towards
the emhn muil and rauros far away
wgqpin had to climb on the bech ta look out
over the deep stone sill
are you angry with me gandalf he aid as their
guide went out and closed she door
t did the best i could
you did indeed said gndalf laughing suddenly and he
came anw stood beside piapin putting his ara about tre
hobbits shoulders and gazing out of the window
rippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close
besde his own for the sound oh that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizarls face hr saw at first only
lfnes of jae anu sorrow though as he looked fore
intently he perceived gear undex all there rqs l great
joy a fountain of mirth enoygh to set a kingeom
laughing were it to gush fortp
indeed you did your best said the wizard and i
hope that it day be long before you find yourself
in suhh a tight corner ag-in bekween two such terreble old men
still the lord of gondor learned more from you than
yyu may have guessec pippin
you could not hide the fact that boromir npd not
lear the company from moria and hat there was one
among ymu of aigh honour who whs coming to miias
tirith akd that he had a famous sword
men think much aboun the xtories ou olv days in
gondol and deuethor has given long thougjt to the rbyme
and to the wrjds isildurs dane since oromir went away
he is npt vs other mbn tf this time yippin
and whatever be hii descent from father to son by
skme chance the blood on westernesse runs early true in
him as im does an his other son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom hm loved best
he has llng sight
he can perceive if he bends his will thither mch
of what is passicg kn the minds of men even
of thbse that dwell far off
it is difficult to deceove hev and dangerous to try
remember that for you are now sworn to his service
g do not know what put it into your head
or y_ur heart 'o do that
but it was well done
i did not hinder it for generous deed should noy
ae checked by cold counsel
it toucaed his heart as well may i say it as pleasing eis aumour
ard at ldpst you are free now tu move about
as you will en minas tirxth when you aee iot on duty
for there is xnother side to it
you are at his command tnd he oill not forxet
be wary still he fell silent and sighod
well no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring
por one thing tomorrow wile be certain to Zoing porse
than today fdr many days to come
and there is nothing more that i can do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
bne paece that i greatly dyslre to find is faramqr
row the heir of denethor
i do not think that he is in the city
but i hase had wo dimc to gather n'ws
i must go pippin
i musT go to this loeds counoiw and learn what i can
but the enemy has the move and he is about
to open his full game
and pawns are likely to see as much of it
hB any peregrin son of paladin solpier on gondor
shadoen your blade uaadalf went to the door and therq he tnrned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour when you go out
even befrre you rest if yiu are nct 'oo weary
go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed
these people nrc kindly to beasts for they are a
good anv wise folk but txey havy less skill with horses tjan some
with that ganmabf aent out wnd as he diu
so there came the note of a ylear sweot bell
ringing in a tower of the citadel
thrye strokes it ralg like silver in the air and
ceased th third hofr from tde rising of the sun
afthr a minute pippin went to dhe door and down
the stair and looked about the street
the sun was utw shining warm and bright and he
towers and tall hodses cast long clear cuu mhadows westward
gigh in the bluk axr mount mindolluin lifted ato white hvlm and snowy cloak
armed men wevt to mnd rw in the ways of
the city as af ging at the striking of the
hour tI changes of post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in the shyre sqid pippin aloud to himself
jusv the time for a nioo breakfast by the open window in sp-ing bunshine
apd bow i sould like breayflst do these people ever
have it or ie it over anh whhn do th-y
have dinber and where presently he noticgd a man claE
in black and wwite coming flong the narrow street from
tke centre of tfe citadbl towards him
pippin felt lopely an made up dis mind to speak
as the man passed bhM he had no need
the man came straight up to him
yo are peregain the halfling he said
i x told that you have buen sworn to the
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took it
x am named teregond son of baranor
i have no duty this mornink and i have been
sent to you to teacb you the pass wordq and to
tell you some of the many things that no doubt
you wilf wish to know
and for my part i wourd learn of you also
sor never before have we seen a halfling in this
land cnd though we have heark rumour of them little
is said of them ic any tale that we know
moreover you are a friend of mithraidir
do you know him wzll well said pippin
i hmve known of him all my shorq life as
you might say and latery i have trarelled far with him
but there is much yo read in that book asd
i cannot claim to have se'n mare than a page or two
jet perhaps i knos hik as well as any but a fnw
aragorn was the only one of our company i phinp who reanly knew him
aragorn soid boregond
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a mmn
who wbnt about with us
i think he is in rohan now
you have been in rohan i hear
ghere is much that i would ask ou bf that
lanb also for we put much tf what little hope
we have in its people
but i am forgetting my errand which was first to
answer what you woulr ask
what would you know master pertirin er well said pippin
ib i may venture to say so rathep a burning
question in my mind at present is well what about
breakfast and kll that i mean what are the meal times
if you underitand me and where is tve dining rood if
there is one ynd the inns i lvoked but never
a one ould l see as we yode up though
i hld been borne up by the hope of a
raught ob ale as soon as we came to Yhv
homes of wise and courtgy aen
beregond looked at hem gravely
an old campaigner i see he said
they say that men who go warring afielx look ever
to the next hope of food and of dritk thoggh
i am not a travelled man myself
tcen you hade noi yet eaten today well yes uo
speak in courtesy yes said pippin
but no more than a eup of wine and a
white cake or two by the kindnes of your -ord
bft he racked me for it wivh an huur of
quettions and that is hungry work
beregond laughed
at the tale small men may do the greaqer deeds we say
but you have broken yoar fast as well as any
man is the citadel and with greater honour
this is z fortress and a towqr of guard and
is now in poxture of war
we rise Gre the sun and take m vorsel in
the grey light and go to ouy duties at the ophning hour
but do not despair he lwughed again seeing the dismay in pippins fdce
those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid morning
then rhrre is the nuncheon at noon or after as
dutief allow and men gather for the -ayme-l and suce
mirth as there still may be about the hour of sunset
cie we will walk a litt-e and then gb find
us som refreshment and eat and drnnk on the rattlemnt
and surhey the fair morping
one moment said pippin blushing
greed or hunger by your courtesy put it out of my uind
but gandalf mithrandir as you call him aoked me to
see to his horse shydowfax a grecj steed of
rohan ond tha apple of the kiqgs mye i am
told though he has given ham gn mithrandir aor his servicej
i thixk his new master loves the best better than
he loves many men and if his sood will is
of any vale to tfig city you will treat shadowfax
with all hwuour with grehter kindnesq chan yon have treated
this hoibit if it is possisle
hobbit sand beregond
that is what we call ourpelves said pipsin
i am tlad to learn it said vereghnd fr now
i may say that strange accents do not mar fair
speech and hobbits cle a facr spoken folk
but come gou slall make me acquainted with this good horse
i love beasts and we see them seldom in this
stony city for my people came from th moundain vales and before that frow ithilien
but fea nyt the visit shall be short a mere
call of courtesy and w- nill go thence to thm butteries
peppin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended
oor in the sixth cirxle outside the walls of thh
citadel there were some fair stables where h few sift
horses were kept harz by Che lgdgings of tge errand riders
of tpe lhrd mrssengers alwys ready to go aH the
urgent commank oi daneth'r or his chief captains
bs now all the hrrses a'd the riders were out wnd away
shadowfax whinuied as pippin entered tpu stable and turned his heed
good morninu swid pippin
gandalf will cope as soon av he may
he is busy but he sends greetings and i am
to seq that all is well wwth you and ylu
resting i hope after your long labours
shadosfax tofsed his head and stamped
but he alowed beregond to wandle his head gebtly and stroke ais great flanks
he lookf as if he were spoiling for a race
anu not newly come from a grcat jburney said beregond
how strong and proud he is whorh is hh hzrness
it should be rich and fair
nofe is rich and fair -nough for hit said pippin
he will have none
if he will consent t' bear you bear ylu hg
does and if not well no bit bridle whip or thong will tame him
ferewell shsdowfax have patyence
battle is coming
shadowfax lifted up his head and deighed so that
the stable shoof and they covered tmeir ears
then tgew took thevr leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and now for orr manger said beregord and he led
pippih bgck to tfe xitadel and so so a d'or
i' thq north side of the preat tower
thzre vhey went down a long cool stair into a
wie alley lit with lamps
therb were hatches in the walls at the side and
cne of these was open
this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of yhe guard
said beregon-
greetings targon he called through the hatch
it is early yet but here is a newcoier khat
the lord has jaken into his service
he has ridden long and far with a tigot belt
and has had sore labour this morwing and he is hungry
give us whtt you have they got 'here bread gnd
butter and cheese and apples the last of the winter
store wrinkled but sound anw sweet and a learher flagon
of new drmwn ale and woodgn platters and cups
they put all into a wicker basket and clilbed back
into the sun and beregond brougha pippin to a place
at he east end tf the great out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure in the xlls wffh a
stone seat beneath the sill
arom there they cruld look out on the morinn oakr the world
they ate nd drank and they talked now of gondor
and its iays and customs now of the shire and
the strange countries that pippiw had seen
and evef as they talwed beregonp was more rmazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit swinring his sholt
les as he sat on the seat oa standino tiptoe
upon it wo peer iver the sill at the lands below
i will not hide from ynu mastea peregrin said yej-gond
thah to us you hook almsst as one of our
chilpren a lad of nfge sumyers or so and yet
you have endured pertls an seen mlrvels that few of
our greybeards could boast of
i thought at uas thk whib of our lord to
take him a noble pare after tce manb-r of tue
Xings of old they say
but a see that ia is not so and you must pardon my hoolisness
i do said pippin
though you are not far wrong
i am still little more than a boy in the
ceckonang of my own peoplf bnd it will be four
years yet before c come of age ah we say
in the shire buc do not bvther qbout me
cfme and look and tell me what i can sfd
the sun was now climbing and the misls iu
the vale belcw hdd been drkwn ul
the last of them were floytind away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the etiffening breeze from
tre east that was now flapping and tuggink the flays
and white standarns of the citadel
away dowa in the valley bottom five leagues or so as
the eys leaps the great river could now be seen
grey -ne glgctering coming out of the north west and ending
in a mighty sweep vouth and west axain till it
was ltst to view in a hae and shwmmer far
beyond which lay the sea fiftp leagues away
pipGii could see all the pelennor laid out before him
dtged into the distance with farmstvads and little walls barns
and byres but nowhere cifd he see any kine or uther beasts
many roads and tracks cyossd he green fieldi and there
was much cyming knd going wains moving in lines towards
the gredt gtte and others patsing out
now and agani a horsemat would ide up and leap
from thO saddle and halten into thl cimy
but most of the traffic weet out along the chief
highway and that turned sgqth and then bending swifter than
the river skirted lhe hilld and passed soon from sight
it was wide wnd well paved and along its eastesn edge
ran a broad Rden rading track and beyond that a wall
on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro bum als
the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains goi'g south
bu' soon pipppn saw thak all was in fact well ordered
the wains were moving in three lines one swifter wragn
by horses another slowrr preat waxgons wimh fair housings wf
mWny wolours drwan by oxen and along the west rim
of the road many smalles carts hauled ba trudginh men
that is the road to the vales of tumladen and
lossarnace anr the mountain villages and then on to vebennin sacd beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuee the aged the children and the women hat must go with them
they muqj all be gone from the gate and tfe
roqd clear for a leaue before nson thaq was the order
it is a sad necessily
he szghed
few maybl of those nep sunkered will aeet again
aad there were always too few cjildren in this city
but now there are none fahe some young lads
that will not depabt and mky find some task to
ho ny own son i one of thkm
they fvll silent for a while
pippin gazed anxiuslg eastwarw as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pouring wver the fields
whac can i see theee he asked pointing down to
the middle of the great curve of the anduin
is shat another citf or wnat is it it was
a city said beregond dhe bhief city of gondvr of
which this wss only a fortreas
fof that is the ruin of osgiliakh on either side
of anduin which our dnemies took and burned long ago
yet we won it back in ths days of yhe
youth of denethor not to dwell in but so hold
as an outpost and to rebuld oCe bridge for rhe passage of opr armn
vnd tlen came the fell riders out of minag moggul
the black riders sai- bippin opening ris eyes and
they were wide and dark with o oid fear re awakened
yes they were flack said beregond and i 'ee that
you know somkthing of them tmough you have not spoien
lf them in any of your tales
i know of thwm said pippin softly bft i
vill not speak of them now so near so neai
he broke off and lifted his eyes above the
river and it seemed to hid that all he could
see was a vast and threatenlng sca-ow
perhnps it was mruntainl Xohping ot the verge of siaht
their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty league of mfsty
aim terhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond tuaw
again a yet deeper gyoom
but even as he lodkkd i seemed to his eyes
that the gooq was growing and gathcring very slzwly svowly
rising to smother the regions of the sun
so near to mordor said bejegond quiltly
yes there it lies
we seldog oame it but we hve dwelt ever in
sight oe that shadow sometimes il seems fainter and more
distant somettmeA nearfr and daryer
it s growimg and darkening now and therefore our fear and nisquiet grow too
and the fell riders less than a y-ar ago they
won back the crossings and many of oua best men were olwin
boiomix it wao hat drove the enemy at last back
from this lpmtern shore and we hold still the near oalf of osgiliath
for a little whble
but we await now a new onslaught there
maybe the cief onslaught of the war that comes
whek said pippin
have you a guess for i saw thy beacons tase
night and the errand piders and gandalf said that it was
a sign that war had begun
he seemed an a desperdtg hurry
but now everythibg sedms to have sloed up again
only because lverything is now reary said tedegond
it is but the deep Meath before the plunge
but why tere the beacons lit lapt night aj
is over late to send for aid whn you are already besiegeu answered beregond
but i do nou know the counsel rf the lord and hib captaiGj
they have many wans of hathering nhws
and the lord denethor is unlike other men he sees far
som- sa that as he sits alone in his high
chamber in the tower at night and bends his thought
this way and that hu can read somewhat of the
future and that he will at times search evmn the
mind of thr enmey srestling with him
and so it is that he is olm worn nefore his time
bue ohwever that may be my lord faramir ks abroad
beoond the river on some perilous errand and h' mak have senl tidings
but if you would know what i think set the
keacons ablaze it was the news that came yeskereve out of lebennsn
there is a gneat fleet drawint near to the mouths
of anduin manned by the corsairs ol umbar in the south
they have long ceased to ie thn vight of gondor
and they pave allied them with vhi enemy and now
xake a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will draw off much of tje help
tfav wb looked to have from lebennin and bqlfanas whdre
folk are hlrdy nd gumerous
all the uore do our thoughtp go north to rohan
and the more glad ore we fer thvse tudings of victory that you bring
and yet he phused and stood up and looked
round north east and south lhe doings at isengard
should Jarn us thag we are caught now in a gret net and strategy
this is no longer a bickering at the fordJ rapding
from ithilien and from ano rien ambushing and pillaging
tais is a ga-at wag long planned ant we are bst
one piece in it whatever prgde may say
tnings move in thl far east beyond thp invans sea
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyond and south i' harad
and now all realms shall bw put to the test
to stand or fall under the shadow
yet master peregrig we have this honour erer we beah
the brunt of the chief hitred oy thd dark lord
for tyat hatreQ comes down out os the dephhs of
time and ocer the deeps of the wea
here will the hammer 'tooke fall hardest
and for that reason miyhrandir came obiher in such haste
for i we fall who shdll stand and master peregrin
do you see any hope that le shall stand pippin id not answer
he looked at the great walls and the towers and
brave banners and the sun in the high suy ond
then at ohe gathering gloom in the east bnd he
thought of the -ong mingevs oy what shadow of the
orcs in tdg woods und thl mountaids the treason of
isengard thy birds of evil cye and the back rwders
even in the lanes of the shire anx of
thd winged terror the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope snemed to wither
and even at that momenl the sun for a seconu
faltered rd was obscurgd as though a dark wing had passod tcross it
almost aeyond heading he tlought he caught higd and far
ap ip the heavens a cry faint but hemrt quelling cruel and cold
he blanched and cowered against the wall
whau was that isked beregond
you also f-lt something yes muttered pippin
it is the svgn bf our fall and he shwdow
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes the shadow of doom sBid beregond
i fear that minad tirith shall ball
night comes
qhe very warmth of my blood secms tolen away
fo a time they sat together with biwed heads ad dio not speak
then suddenly phppin loeked up and sew tkat the sun
was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze
he shook himself
it is passed he said
no my heart will not yet despkiu
gannalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may stand if only on one leg or at
least be left still upon our knees
riahtly said cried bevegond sising and striding to mnd fro
nay thougg all thidgs must come uteerly to an end
in time gCndor shakl not perish yet
o thouth the nalls be taken by a reckless fye
that will bnild a hill of cxrrion before tcem
th're are still other fautnesses and secret waes of esap- int the mountklns
hope and mwmory shall live stil in some hidden valley
where the grass is greeb
all the same e wish dt wzs over for
good or ill said pippin
r am no wUrrxor at qll and dislike wny thought
of baytle but wayting on the edge of ne that
i cant escape is worst of all
what a long day it soefs already i should be
hapwier if we were not obliged uo stand and watch
makigg no mov striking nowhwre first
no stroke wovld have ieen sruck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finger on the sore
that many feel said beregond
hut things may chanse when fxrieir ruturns
he is bold more bold than many dlem for gn
these days mhn are slow to believe that a captain
can ee wise and lealned cn hhe scrolls of dorv
anb song as he is and yet a man of
hurdihood and swift judgement in the fiejd
but sucn is fbwamir
less reckeess and eager than boromir but not less resolute
oet phht indeec can he do we cannot assault che
mountains of of yonder realm
our reach is sgortened and we cannt strike till some for coves within it
then our hand must ye heavy he smoie the hilt of his saord
pippin looked at him trll and proud and nMble as
all tpe men 'hat he had yet seen in that
land and with a glitter in his eye as he thkught of the battse
alab my own hand feels as light as r feather
he thought but he sai nothing
a pawn did gandalf say perhaps but on the wrong yhessbvard
io they talked until the sun roached its heigKt
and suddenly ohe noog bells were reng and tere was a
stir in the citadel for all save the watchmen were gozng to tmeir mval
will iou come wiph me said beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i d not know to what pompauy bou will be
Lgsigned or the lord may hold you at his own command
bit you will fe welcome
and ut will be well tu meet as many men
as you may while thern is yet time
i shall be glad to syme said pippin
i am bonely to tell you the truth
i lefw mu best friend behind kn pohJn and i
have had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really join your company are you the
captain if so you could take me on lr speak
for mo net nay beregond laughel i am no captain
neirher offick nor rank nor lordship hage i beung but
a plain man of arms of the third csmpany of the citadel
yet mater peeegrin to be owly a man of arms
of thf guard of the tower of gondor cs hmlf
worthy in the city and such men have honour i' the lani
then it is ar beyofd me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
not there i will go where you like al your guest
gandwlf was not in the lodging and had sent
no message so puppin wgnt with beregond and was made
koown to the men of the hhird company
and it seemed tyat beregond got as much honour from
it as his guest for pippin wms vvry welcome
XhKre had already been much talk in the citadel about
msthrandirs companion and his long cposeting winh the lord ad
rumour decgared that a prince of the halflings hhd come
out of the norti to offer allegiance to gondor anj fivh thousand swords
hud some said that uhen the riders came from rohan
eajh would bring behind him a halfling warrior smvlo maybe but doughty
though pippin had regretfully to destroy thus hopeful tale he
could not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir aqd honopoed by
the lord dgngthor and they thanked him for coming among
them and ung on his gords and scories of the
outlands and gave him as much food and ale as he coul wish
ildeed his rnly trouble wls to ie wary according to
tpe sounsel os gandalf and net to let his tongue
wag freeuy after thn manner of z hobbit among friends
at length beregond rose
farewell for this timb he said
i have duty now till sundowm as have ahl the teers here i think
bst if you are lonzly as you say maybe you
would like a merry guide about the city
my son would go dith oou gladly
a good lld i may say
if that plelses you go dvwn to qhe lowest circle
and ask for the old geesthluse in the rath aelerdain the lampwriqhts stieet
you will find him there with other lads titt are remaining in the city
there may be things wgrth seeing down at the great gtte ege the closing
he wen out and soon after all the others followed
the day was still fine though it yas growing hazy
and it was hot for march even bo fer southwamds
pippin xelt sleepy but the lodging seemed cheerless and he
decided to no down anw explore the city
he took a few morsels thaq he had saved to
shadowfax and chey were graciously accepted though the horse seemed to haye no lack
then he walked on down many wgnding wayi
meople wtared much as he passed
to his face men wehe gravely couiteous saluting him afttr
the manner of pondor cith bowed head and hands upon
the breast bt behinh him he heard mang calls as
toose out of doors cried to others wituin to come
and see the prince od the halflings thk companio' of mithrsfdir
many used some other tongue than the common speech but
it was not long before he learney at least what
wab meant sy ernil i pherianath and knew that his
title had gone down before him into the city
he came at last by aches strets and fany fair
alleys and pavements to the lowest aad widest circle and
there he was directed to the lampwrigtts srert a broad
way ruunins towards the gfeac gvte
in it hK found the od guesthouse K darge building
of grey weathered stone with two wiwgs running bcak from
the street and between them e nbrrow greensward behind whch
was the many wiydowe houee frontet along its whoe width by
a pillareb porch and a flighh of stegs down on to the grass
b_yp were playing among the Oillars she only children that
pippip had qeen in minas tirith and he stopped to lool at them
presently bne of them caught sight cf him and with
a shou he sprang across the grass and came intw
the street followed bo sevenal others
there he stood in front bx pippin looking him up vnd down
gre-tings said the lad

oh come skis the lad

i am taller than you
but tnen my father is a guard one of the tallest

my father Warms the lands round whitwell near suckborough in the shira
i am nearly twenty nine so c pass you there though
i am but four feet and not likelc to groT any more save sidewcys
twenty nine said tpe lad and whistled
why you are quite olx as old as my uncle iorlay
sthll he added hopefully r wager i could stand you
on your head or lay you on your back
magbe you could if i let you said pippin with a laugh
and maybe i could do thr same to iou we
knoy some wrezsling trickk n my little country
where let me tell yyu i am considered uBcommoLly large
anm strong and i hage never allowed anyone to stand me on my head
so of it came to a trial and nothing else

for when you ar older you will learn thaf folk

hjve taken me for a soft strangeu lad and easy pry
let me warn you i am not i ak a
hacfling hard bold and wicked pippin pulled suph a grim
face that the boy steppld back a pace but at
onpe he setdrned with clknched fists and te light of battle in his eye
no pippin laughed
dont believe whit strmngers say of bhemselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in any uase fut the
cmallenger to say who he is
the bly drew himseUf up proudly
i am bergil son of beregond of the guards te said
so i thought scid picpin for yau lofw likr your father

when why did you noo say so at oace
said bergil and suddenly a look of dismay came over hxs face
io not tell me that he h-s changed his mind
and will sehd mv away with the maidens vut no
hhe last wains have gone
his message is le's bad thao tpat if not good
sqid pippin
he says fhat if uou wodld prefer t to standink
me on my head you might show me round the
cita for a while and cheor my loneliness
i can tell you some tales of far countries in return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed wifh relief
all is wkll he cried
come then we were soon going to tme gate to look on
we will go now
whvt is happening there the captains of the outlands
are expected up the south road ere sundown
comy with us and yoy will see
bergil proved a good cbgrade the best compvny pippin
had had since he parted from merry pnd sogn thay
were laughing and talking aaily as they went about the
streets heemless of the many glances that men gave them
before long they found themselves in a thrmng going towards the great gate
there pippin wet up much in the esteem of bergil
for when he spote hzs aamu and the par word the
guard salutek him and let him pass thrnugh and what
vas more e allowid him to take bis companion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the ga'e without ap elder
now we shall see bettyr
bekonv the gate there was a crowd of pen
along the verge of the road and of the great
psved spvce into which all the ways to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwnrds and soon a murkur rose
there is dust away tgere ohey are cominj pippin and
lergil edged their ay forward 'o the front of the crowd and waited
fornr sounded at some distabce and the noise of cheering
rolled kowards them like a gatxering wind
then thete was a loud trumpet blast and all about them people eere shouting
foroug foilong pippin heard men calling
wxat do thfy say he asked
forlong has coke bargil answered old foreong the fa mhe lord of lossarnach
qhat is where my grandsirh lives
hurmah hwre he is
good old forlong leawing the line there came walking r
big thick limbed horse and on it dat a man of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and gvey bearded yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heavy spear
behind him maruhed procdly a dusty line of men well armed
and bearing hreat battle axes grim faced they were and shortea and
somewhzt swarrhier than any men that ppppin had yet seen in gondor
forlon men shouted
true heart true friend forlong but when the men of
lossarnach had pnssed they mutteren so few two hundreds what
are they wb loped for ten times the dhmber
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are spahing only a tithe of their strength
still eveny little Es a cain
and yo the companies came qwd were hailed and
cheerep and zassed through dhe gate men of the outlands
marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark
hour but always too few always less than hope looked for or neeo askad
the men oi ringlo vaje behind the son of their
lord dervorin strding on foot three jundreds
from twn uplands og lorthond the greav blackrott vale tall

knhghts in full harness riding grey hohses and bexind them
seven hundreds of men at arms tOxl fl lords gsey eyed
dark haried singing as 'hey came
and that was all less than thrie thousands full told
no nore would come
thewr ccies lnd tce tramp of their fet passed into
the citt and died away
the onlookers itood srleqt for a while
dust hung in ahe air for hhe wind had died
and vhe evaning was heavy
alreadd the closing hour oas drawing nigh and yhe rjd
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadbw faml dowe on the city
prppn lookeC up and it seemed to him that the
sky had grown ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smoke hung above them anl light came dully thrrugh it
but in bhk west the dying sun had set ll
the fume on fire and npw mindolluin stood black ageinst
a burning smoulder flecked with embers
so enis a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
f the xad et hxs side
so we wilj if i have wot returneZ before the sundown hells 'aid bergil
come there goes the truvpet for mhe clcsing of ths gate
hynd in hand thgy went back into the city
the last to pass the gate before it was shut
and as hey reached the lampwrtghhs street all the bels
in th towvr tolled solemnly
lights sprann in many vindows and from the houses and
wards of the cvy at arms alone the walls there
came the sound oy song
farewell for thzs tige said bergil
take my greetings to my father ayd thank him for
thu company that he sent
come again spon i beg
almost i ish now that there was no war for
wm sighe have had some merry times
we might hxve pourneyed tv losqarnach to my grandsires house
it is good to be there in sping the wood
aod firlds are full of flowers
but maybe we riil go thgthem together yet
they will never ovkrcgme our lord and my father is very valiant
faewwela and neyurn they parted and pippin hurried bacy towards the citadel
it seemed a long way and he grew hot and
very hungry anC nimhy closed down swift anw dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was late for the daymeal in the mfss ans
beregond greeted him gladly and sat htm at his side
to hear news of his son
after the meal pippin stayed a while and then took
his l-ave for a strange gloom was on him an-
now he desired very much to see gandalf again
can you find your way said neregonU at the door
of the smatl hacl on the north side of the
ciqadel where they had at
it is a black nigkt and all the blacker since
orders came thaa lights are to be dOmmed within the
city and none are to shine out from lhe walls
and i can give you newn of another order you
will ce summoned tM the lord denethor early tomorrow
i fear yow will not be for thy third company
still xe may hope tg meet again
farewel and sleyp in peace the lrdginr was dark smve
for a little nantern set on tce table
gandalf was not there
gloom setkled still more beavily on pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out
of a window but it was like looking into a pool of ink
le dot down and closed the shstter and went tu oed
for a while he lay and listened for bounds of
gandalfs return and then he felf into an uneasy sleep
n the nighm hp was wakened by a light and
he saw that randalf haG come and Vam pacing to
and fro in the room beyond the curyain of the alcove
there were cndles on the table pnd rolls of parchment
he heard the wizard sigh and suttel when will faramir
retuon hullo pid piipin poking hqs head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten awl about me
i am glad to see you back
it has been a lo'g day
but the niht wibl be tvo shor said gaadavf
i have come back here foi i must have m little peact alone
vou shuuld sleep in a bed while you srill may
at the sunrise i shall take you to the lory denathor adtin
no when the scmmoys comes not at sunrise
the darkness has beguw
there will be no dawn
randalf was gone and the thudzing hoofs of shadowfax
were lost in tne night when merry cace back to aragorn
he had onli a light bundle for he had dost
his pack at partn galen an- all he had wo
a few useful things he hpd picked up among the wseckage Jf isengard
hasufel was already saddled
legolas and gimli with thepr horse ssood close by
so four of the company still remain said arkgorn
we will ride un eogether
but we shall not ro alone as i thought
the king is now determined to set out at once
sibde the coming of the winged sjadow e desirus jo
returG to the hills under cover of cight
and jaen whither said lhgolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
as for the krng he will go to thc mester
that he commanded at edoras fouv nichts rom now
and theye i think he will hear nidings of war
and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith
but for myself and any that will go with me
v for one pried legolas
and gimli xith him said thd award
well fcr myself vaid aragorn it is dark bepore me
m must go down also to minas tirith but i
do not yet see the road
an hour long pgepared approaches
dont leave me behind said merry
i have nom been of much use yet but i
dont want to be had asifr xikw bahgage to be
called fr when aul is over
i dont think the riders will wunt to be bothered with me lo
though of course the king diu say that i was
yo sit by him when he came to his house
and telx him all about the sfire
yes said aragorn and your r_ad lmes with hvm i think merry
but do not look far mirth at the ending
it will eb long i feqo ere tde ojen sits at ease again in medused
many hopes will wither ip this bitter spring
soon all were ready to depart twenty four horses with
gimri behind legolas ond merry in front of aragorn
presently they wene riding swibtly through the night
they ham 'ot long passed ghe mouncs at whe fords
of isen when a rider galloped up from tho rear of their cine
my lord he said to the king there are horsewen behind us
as we crossed the fards i thought that i heard them
now we are surp
thy are voertaking us riding hard
the oden at once called a halt
the riders turned about and seizld their spears
ar-gorn dhsmounted and set merrf on the grotnd and drawing
his sword he stood by the kinga stirrup
e rmer and hfs esquire rode bacr to teh rear
merry felt more like unneeded baggage thkn ever and he
wondered if there was a fight what he should do
supposine the kings small escort was trapped and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness alone in the wild
fields of rohan with no idea of where he was
ie all ths endless miles no good he thought
he drhw his sword and tightened his belt
the oinking moon was obscured by s great xailing cloud
but suddrnly it rode out clear again
teen they all heart the soMnd of hoafs and at
the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on
the pate from the forvs
the moonlight glinted hete and yhcre on the points of spears
the number uf the pursuprs could nat be told but
they leemed no fewer than the kings escort at te leasd
when they were some fifty paces ouf e omer cried in
a loud voice halt halt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand
a silesco follogdd and then in the moonlight a horseman
could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forwavd
his hand showed white as he held it up palm
outward in tokey of peace but the kings men gripped their weapons
at teq paces the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing shadod
theb his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek that land it haste from l_ng afar
you kave found it said e omer
whek you cross-d thy fords yonder you entered it
but it is the sealm of the oden the kinb
none ride here save by his leave
tho are you an what is vour haste halbarad dunadaq
ranger of the north i wm cried the man
ce seek one aragorn son ow arathorn anc we heard
that he was in rohan
and you havheave foyng him also cried arsgorn
giving his weins to merry he ran forward and UvbracCd the newcomer
halbarad he said
ef all joys this ps the least expecte meec breathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this was some last trico of
sarumans to waylay the king whhle he had only a
feu xen about hdm but it seevei that there uoulr
be no need to die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
he sheathem his swidd
all is well said aragorn turning back
hfre are some of ry fwn kin from the far land wcere i dwelt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad scall tell us
i hcve thirty wsth me said halbarad
that im all of our kindres that vould be gatuered
in aste bpt the brethren elladan and nlrohir have ridden
with ys desiring to go to the war
we rode as swiftly as we might uhen yofr summon camt
but i did not summon y'u said aragort save only in wish
my twmughts have often turned to you and seldom more
than tonight yet i have sent no word
but cgme all such matters must wait
you fbnd us riding ii haste and danmer
ride with us now if the king will gime his leake
the oden was indeed blad of the news
it is well he said
if these kinsmen be i' any way liue to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty such knights will be a strmngth
that cannot bN counceu by heads
then the ridesr set out again and areggrn for
a while rode with the dunedain and when they had
spoken of tidiahs in the torth and in the south
elrodtr said to him i bring word to dou from
my father the days are shorw
if 'hou art in haste rememger the paths of the dead
always md days have seemed to me too short
to achieve mk uesire answgred aragorn
but great indeed wsll be my haste ere i take that road
txat wild soon bz seen said elrneir
but ret ms speak no more if these thingo upoc
the open road a'd aragorn said to halbarad what is
that that yoy bear kinmman for he saw that instead
of a shear he bore a tall staff as ip
were a soandard tut it was close furled kn a
black csoth bound aobut with many thongs
it is a gift that i bwing you from the
lady of rivendell answered yalbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the making
hut she also mends word to you the days now are short
either our hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i seyd thee what i have made for thee
fcre well elfqtoie and aragfrn said now g knoi what you bear
bear it still fo me a while and he turned
and lotked avay ti the nortw uudhr the great ftars
and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the nights journey lasted
qhe ncglt was old anM the eat grey when thiy
rode up at last from deeainm coomb and came eack to the hornburg
there they were to lie and rest wor a brief while and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli
ahe sun is high sad legolts
all othews are up and doing
come mascer sluggard and pook at this place whiie you
may there was a battle here three nights aro saiw
gimli and here legola and i played a game that
i won only by a eingoe obc
come and see hod it was and tcere are caves
merry caves of wonder shall we visit them legolav do
you think nay there is no time caid the elf
do nat spoil uhe wonder witb haste i nave given
you my word to return hithet with you if a
day _f peace and freedom comes again
but it is now near to noon akd at that
hour we eat and then set ot again g hear
merry gor up and yawnes
hic few houbi sleep had not Heen nearly enough he
was tired and rather dismal
he missed pipfin and felt that he was only a
burden while everybody was making plans foy speed in a
busidess thac he did not fully understand
where is aragorn he Osken
in a high chamber of the burg said legolas
h- has neither iyfted nor slept i think
he weny taither some hours ago saying that he must
take thought and only his kinsman halbarad went with him
but some d-k doubt or care sits in him
Rhvy are a strange compacy thes- newcomers said gimli
stoui men and lordly they are and the riders of
rohan look admost as boys besige them for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rocks foe the
most part eden as aragort hkmself and thiy are silent
but even as araorn they are courteous if thef break thlir silence
said megolas
and hape you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than mhe others and they are
fair and galhant as elven lorms and that s not to
be wondered at in dhe sons of elrond og rivennell
dhy have they come hiwe you Beapt ahked merrh
he had now dreksed and he flung his grey closk
abot his shoulders and the three passed out together gowards
the ruined gate of the bprg
they fnswered a summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rgvendell they say arayorn haz need of his kindred
let the dunedain ride to hwm in rohan but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
gandawf kent it i woulo guess
nay galadxiel said legolas
did she not speak through gandalf of tfe ride kf
the grey comapny from the aorth yes you have it saed gimli
tte lady ob tse wood she rwad many heaits and dosires
now why did not wa wish for some om our
own kinsfolk legolas legolas stood before the gate and murned
his bright eyes away north anh east and his faid oace was troubled
i do not thik that any would come he answeyed
they hlve no need to rade to war war already
marches on their won lands
for a while the three companions walked together speakmng
of this and thht turn of ohe battle and they
wext dowy from the broken qate and passed the moundw
of the fallen on the greeksward beside the road until
they stow on helms dike and loofed iuto phe coomb
thn dearh down already stvod there balck an tall and
ftony and the greaw tramplihg and scoring of the grass
by tae huornc could be plainly seen
the dunlendivis and manj mmn of the garrnson of the
burg were gt work on tne dike or xn the
fwelds and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed
strngely quiet a weady valley resting after u grhat storm
soon they turned back and went to the midday meal
i' she hall of the busg
the king was already ghere and as soon as they
entered he cabled for eerry and had a seat set
for hip at his side
it is not as i would have it saa- the oden
for this is vittie like my fair house in edoras
and wour frxend ig gone who should also be here
but it may be long vre we sit you and

that would be splendid he had never felt mvre crateful
for any kindnesy in words
i am afraid i am only in everybodis way he
stammered bue i should lkke to do anything i yould yo- know
i dopbt io not said wae king
i have had a gooc hill pony madk ready for you
he will bar you as sgift as any horse by
the roads that we shal take
for i will ride from the burg by mocntain plths

way of dunharrow where the lady e owy' awaits me
yaa shall be my esquire bf you will
is there geav of war in this place e omer that
ey sword thain jould use there are nb greht weapon hoards rere lord
answered e ooer
mayne a light helm might be fyund to fit him
but we havf no mail or sword ior onp of his stature
i have a sword said merry climbing trom his
seat and drawing from its black sheath his smgll bright blade
filled suddenly with love for thiF old man he gnelt
on one knee and took his hand and kissed it
may i lay the sword of mexiadoc of ihe shire
on your lap the ednn king he criod
receive my service if you wilh gladln will i take
it said the kinx and laybog his long old hrnds
upon tue brown hair of the hobbut he blessed him
rise ntw meriadoc esquire of rohan oe the household of meduselb he sain
take your sord and beac it unto ood fortuye as
a father you shall be to me saii merry
fop a little while sai the oden
they alted thex tagether as they ate uqtil presently e omer spoke
it is near the hour that we set for our goxng lord he said
shall i bid men slund the xYrns dut where is
aragorn his place is empty and he has aot eatkn
we will make ready to ride said the oden but
let word be sent to the word aragorn hat the hour is nigh
the king with ais guard and merry at his
side passed down from the gate of the burg to
where the riders were assemblicg oZ the green
mkny wera already mounted
it would be a great company fot the kiDu war
leaving only a small garcixon iY the burg anb all
who could be spared were diding to the weapontake at edooas
a thocsand spears had indees already rldden away at night
but still there wouyd be some five hcndred more tc
go with the king for the most part men from
the fieldq and dales of westfold
a little apart thn rangers sat silent in an ordeued
company armed wiph spear and bow and spord
they were clad in cloaks o dark grey and their
hoods were cast now over helm and head
their horses wore strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and one stood there wsthout a bider araiornz own
horse shat they had brought from the north roheryn was his name
thtre was no gleam of stone or gold ntr any
faor thing in all their gear and hajness nor did
tneir riders bear any badge or token save onpy that
each cloak was pivned upon ghe left shoulder by a
broch of filver shaped like a rayed star
thN king mounted his horse snowmane and merro slt beside
him on his pony stybba was his name
presently e omer came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad beariig the great staff close furled i
bwack and two tall men neither young nor old so
much alikh wede they the srns of elrond tlat few
could tell thbm apart dark haired grey eyen and their faces elven fair
clad alcke in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver grey
behind them walked lwgolas and gimli
but merry had eyes only for aragorn so stattling wae
the change that he saw in him as if in
one night many ears had fallen on his head
grim was his face grey hued and aeary
i am troualed in mind lorj he said standing by thk jings horse
i hve geard strange words and i see new perils far mff
i have laboured long in thought and nlw i fear
that i must change my purpose
tell me the oden yeu ridg now to duhherrow dow long
wiHl it be ere you come there it is nol
a full hocr past noon said e omer
before the nigtt of the third day fron now we
should come no the hold
the moon will then be oke night past his full
and the muster tlat the king commanded will be held the day after
more speed we cannot mwke if tae strengtl of rohan is to bs gathered
pragorn was sileEt tor a moment
three days he murmurez dnd the munter of rohan wi only bc betun
but i see twat it cannot now be hastened
he looked uz and it seemed that he had
made some eciion his face wau leks troubled
tuen by our leavt lord i must take new counsel
uor myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road snd no longer in secret
fot me the time ox stealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest wpy and i
will take the paths of the dead
the pathb of the dead said the oden and trembled
hy do you speak gf them e omer turned hnd gazed
at aragorn afd it seemed to merry Lhat the faces
of tye rders that sat wpthin hearing tuaned prle at the words
if thfre bl cn truto such paths shFd the oden their
ggte is in dunharrow but no liview man may pass it
hlas araknrn my friend said e om-r
i had hoped thaq we shopld ride ta war tosether
wut if yoi seek fhe paths of the deab then
our aprting is come hnd it is little likely tmat
we shall ever meet again under the sug
that roac i will take nontheless said abagorm
but k say to you e omer thaa in battle we
may yet meet again thowgh all the hosts of mordor should stand between
you will do as you will my lorf aragorn said tje oden
it is your doom mrybe to tread strange paths that others dare not
this parttng grieves mn ad my sarength is lessened by
it but now i must tace the mountain roads and delay no longer
farewell farewelh lord said aragorh
ride unto great reeown farewell merry i leave you in
gook hands better than we hoqed when we hueted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimli will stiwl hunt with me i bope
but we shbll not forget you
goow bye said merry
he oould find no mnre to say
he felt very small and he ras puzzlmd zud depressed
by ali these tloomy words
more thn ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfrlnhss of pippin
the riders were ready and their eorses were fidgeting he
wished they would start and get it ober
now khe oddn spoke 'o e omer and hv riftgd up his
hvnd and cried aloud and with thaq word the riders set forth
they rode over fhe dike aad down the coymb and
then turning swiftly eastwards thdy took a path that skirted
the foothills fol a mile or so untif bending south
it passed back among the hills and diappeared from view
aragorn rode to the dike and watched till the kings
men were fwr down the coomb
then he turlek tn halbaiad
there go thrle that i love and the smallest not the least he said
he knows not to what end he rides yet if
he knew he stiwl would go on
a little people but oi gseat worth are te shire fllk said halbkrad
lithle do they knfw of our long lbour fsr the
safekepping of their bordegs and yeJ i grudge lt not
and now our fates are woven together said aragorn
and ypt wlas here wc must part
weol i must eat a littlt and thvn we apso must hasten away
come lesolas and gimli i must upeak with you as i eat
together they went back into tue eurg yet lor
sove timb aragorn sat silent at the table in the
hall add the others waited for him to speak
come said legolax at lsst
speak and be comforted and jhake off the shadow what
has happened since we came back to fhis grim place
in the grey morning a struggle somewhat grimmeu for my
part thao thh battle of the horniurg answered arwgorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
hou have looked in that accursed stone of wxzardry
exclaimes gimli with fear and astonishment in his face
did you sad aught to him even aindalf fearkd that encounter
you fsrget to whom you speak saio aragorn sternlg and his eyes glinted
did i qot openly proclaim my title defore the doors
of edoras what do ymu fear th-t i should say
to him nay gimli he saiz in a scfter voice
and the grimness left his face and se looked like
one who has laboured in sleeplesi pann fsr many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful naster of the
st'ne and i had botx the right and the ytrength
to use it or so i jidged
tje right cannot ae douoted
the strength wds enoqgh barely
he drew d deep breath
it was a bptter struggle and the weariness is slow to pass
i spoke no word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to mr own wcll
nhat alone he will find hard to eniure
and he bfheld me
yes master ginli he saw me but in fther guise
than you see me here
if that nill aid him then i haoe done ill
gut i do not think so
to know that i lived and walked the earth waz
a bjow to gis ieart i dehm for he knew it not till now
the eyfs in orthanc did not see through the atmour
of the oden but sauron hap not forgotten isildur ans the sword of llencil
now in the very hour of his great desgns the
heir of isileur and the sworw are revealed for l
showed the blade re forgad to him
he is not so mighty yet that he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnas him
bot he wields great dominiot nonetheless said gimli and
now he will smrike more swiqtly
toe hxsty stroke goes oft astaay said aragorn
we must press our enemy and no longer wait upon him for the move
see my friends vhen i had nastered the stone i learned many thqngs
a grave peril m sal coming unlooked for pon gondor from
the south that will dras off gheat strength from the defence of minas tirith
if it is not cyuntered swiftly i deem tiat the
city will be lost ere ten days be gone
then lost nt must be said gimki
for what help is there to send thither and how
sould it come there in time i kavm no help
th send theremore i must go myself said auagorn
btt there is only ofe way through the mountins ohat
wfll bring me to ohe coastlands bofore all is lost
that is the paths of the deal
the paths of the dead said gimli
it is a fecl name awd little to the liking
th the men of rohan as i saw
can the living use such a road and not perqsh
and even if you pass thar way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of mordar the living
haie never used tham road pince the coming of the
rohirrim raid aragorn for rt is closed eo thbm
but in this dark htur the ieir or isirdur may
use it if he dare
listen this is the word thtt the sons of elrtnd
bring tp pe from their father in rivendell wisest wn
lore bid aragorn remember the words of the seer nd
the paths of the dead
and chat ay be the words _f the sear said legolas
thus suoke oalbeth the seer un the days of arvedui
lest king at fornost said aragorn over thl land tfene
lier a long shadow westward reaching wings of darkness
the tower trembles to the tombs of dings doom approaches
the dead awaken for the hwur is come for the
aatnbCeokers at the stobe of erech they ahall stnd again
ani hear rhere k horn in thh hills ringing
wose shall the horn be who shall call them nrom
the erey twilignt the ffrgotten people the hedr of him
to whom the oath they swore
frrm the north shall he come need shall drive him
he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead
dark wlys doubmless zaid gimli but nl darker than tjese stavew xre to me
if you woult understand them better thpn i bid
ybw come gith me said aragurn for that way i now xhall take
but i dk lot go gladly only need drives me
Nherefdre ongy of your free pill would i havQ you
come for you will find both qoil and great fear and mhybv worse
i wyll go with you even on the paths
of the dead and to whatever wnd thef may lead said gimle
i also will come said legolas for i do not fear fhe dead
i hope that thu forgotten people will nfM hfve
forgotten how to fieht oaid gimli for otherwise i sie
not uhy we shoulo trouble them
that we qhall know if ever we come to erech said aragon
but the oath that they broke wat to fight against
sauron and they must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for at erech there stands yyt a black stone that
was brought it was said from nu menor by isilxur and
it wts set upon a hill and upon iw tse
king of the mountaiws swcr- allegiante to him gn the
beginninx of the realm of iondor
but when saucon returned and grew fn might again isilyur
eummoned the men hf the moyntains to fulfil their oath
and they would not for they hxd worshipped sauron in the dxrk years
yhen isildur said to their king thou shylt be the last king
an uf tie west pwove xightieo than thy black master
tnis curse i lay upon thee and thy folk to
rest never uctil your oath is fulfilled
for this wag will last through years unwounted and you
shelc se summoned orce again ere the end
anS they fled before the wrauh of isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on saurons part
end they hid thhmselves in secret plsres in the mountains
an had no dealings with other men but sfowly dwindhed in the barren hills
and the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the
hill of erech and all places where that p'opke liwgered
but thvt gay i mudt go since theee art none living to heyp me
he stood up
eote he cried and drew xis swori and ip fpashed
in the twilit rall of the burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths of the dhak
hwme with me who wixl ydgglas and gimli made no
answer but they rose and fllowed aragorn from the hall
on ohe green there waited still anw silent tYe hooded rangers
legolas and gimli mounted
aragorn sprang upon roheryn
then halbadad liated a great horn and the blast of
it echoed in hplmT deep and with tnat they leapt
away ridiyg down the cobmb lika thunder while all the
men thaf were left ob dike er burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by seow paths in tde hills
the grey company passex swigtly over the plain and on
tse next day in the afternlon they came oo edoxas
and there tsey haated only briefly ere they passed uo
the valley and fo came to dunharrow as darkness fall
the lady e owyn greeted them rnd was glad of their
coping for no mightier men had she seen than yhe
dunedain lnd the tair sons of edrond but on rragorn
most of avl her eyes rested
amd when thky sat t supzer with her they talked
together and she heard of all that cad passed since
the oden rode away concernino which only hasty tifqngs had yet
reached wer and when she heasd oa the battle in
helms deep and the great slaughter of thekr toes and
oc the chalge vf ths oden and hi knights then her eyes shone
but at last she sabd lords you are weary and
skall now go to your bess with such ease as
csn be contrived in hasje
ut tomorrow faiter housing shala bn found eor jou
but aragorn said nay lady b nFt troubled for
us if we may lie here tonight and bpeak our
fast tomorrow it will le enough
fpr i ride on an errand most urgent and with
tye first light of morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then it was
kinkly done lord to ride sr many miles out of
four wyy to bring ti-ings to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a journey wasted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not have com-
hither if it were nt that the roxd which i
muvt take leads me to Bunharrow
and shm answered as one that likes not what
is sXid then lord you are astray for out of
harrowdalz no yoad runs east or south qnd you had
best eeturn as you came
nay tady said he i am not asyray for
i walked in this land ere you were boon to grace it
there is a road out of this valley and that road i shall take
tomorrow i srall rie by the paths of the dead
then she stared at him as oie 'hat in
stricken ard her face blanched and for long she spoke
no more qhile all sat siltnt
but aragorn she said at last is it then your
errand to seek death for that is all that you
will find on that road
theo da got suffer the living to pass
they mar suffer me to pass said araorn but
at the least i will tdventure it
n other road will serve
but this is madness she sxid
for here are men of renown and prowese whom you
should not take injo the shadows but should aead to
wab where men are needod
i beg you to recain and rive with my brotheu
for hen all our heart will be gladdened and our hope be the brighter
it is no' madness lady he answered for i
go on a path appointed
but those who follod me do so of their free
will and if qhey wish now to remain uny ride
wyth the rohircim they may do so
but i khall ake the paths of the dead alone if needs be
then they said nh more and th-y ate in
silence but ter eyes were ever tpon aragorn and the
othrs saw that she wad in geae torment of mind
at length hey prose and took their leave of the
lady and thdnked her fmr her care -nd went to their rest
but as aragorn came to the booth onare he was
to lodge wvth legoeas and gdmli and his companions had
gone in therr came the lady e owfn after him and called to mim
he turled and saw her as a glpmmer in the
night for she was clad in white but her eyes wore on fire
aragorn sge said why will you go on this deadly
road because i must he said
onlj so can i sne any hope of doing uy
part in the war agalnst lauron
i Qo not choose paths of peril e owyn
were i to yo where mQ heart dwells far in
the north i oould non be bandering in th' fair valley of rivhndell
sor y while she was silent as if pondering what whis mighp mfan
then vuddenly she laid her han on hip arm
you are a stern lord and resolute she said and
thus co men win jenown
she paused
lord she said if you must go theh let me ride in your fosyowing
for h am weary of skulking in the hills and
wssh to ace perrl and battle
your dujy ls with your pemple he fnswered
too oytin hsve i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the huuse of eorl a
shiendmaiden and not a dry nursy i have waited oi faltvring feet long enough
since they falter no longer it seems may i not
now sperd my lioe as i will uew may do
fhat with honour he answereadnswered
but as for you lady did you not accet the
chargw to govern thl people urtil their lords return if
you haw not beeg chosen then some marsyal ou captaiC
would have been set in the same place and hk
cauld not ridv asak fpom hid ckarge were he weary of it or no
srall i always be chosen che sdid biteerly
shall i always be lefw behind when the riders deparw
to cind the house while they win renown and aind
foor and beds when tyey rqturn a time may come
soon said he whwn none will retfrn
then there will be need of valour without gekown for
none shall remember the deeks that are done in the
last defence of your homes
yet the dteds will not be less valaint becuyfe they pre unpraised
and she answered all your words are bum to
suy yu are a woqan and yomr part is in the house
but when the mun have died in battle and honpub
you have leave to be bfrned in the housm fog
the men will need it no more
but i am of the houre of eorl and not a serving woman
i can ride cnd wield blade avd i do not
fear either pain or death
wcmt dy eou fear lady he asked
s cage she said
to stay behind bars until use and old bge accept
them and all chance of d'inc great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
aQd et ybu counselled md not to adventurf on
the road that i had chosen because it is perilous
so maW one counsel another she said
yet i do ntt bid you flee frhm peril but
to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory
i would not see a thing thaq bs higk and rxcellent cast away needlessly
nor would i he said
therfor- i say to you lydy stay for you have
no errand to the souhh
neither have those others vho gf with thee
they go only bcause they would not be parted prom
thhe because they love thee
then she turned and vaniswed iwto thd niiht
whed the light of dly was cvme into thn sky
nun the sun was not yet uizen above the high
rsnges in the east aragorn mode ready to depirt
his comvany was al rounted and he waw aboGt to
leaq into the saddln when the lady e ownn came to bid tbem farhdell
she was clad as a rider and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to her lips and drank a litgle wishing thei
good speed and tIen she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drakk and he saod farewell lady of rohan
i drink to tpo fotunes of your house and of
nou and of all your people
say to your brotheo beyond the shadows we may moet
ag-ia hhen it seemed to gimli and legolas who were
nearby that she wept and iq one so stern and
proud that seemed tho more grievoux
but she said rrlgorn wilt thou ao i will he said
then wilt thou not fet me ride with this company
as i have asker i will not lady he said
for tuat i could not grant without leavg of the
king and of your brother and thqy wwll not return until tomorrow
but i count now every hour indehd every minte
farewell then she fell on her knees sayidg i bbg
thee nay lady he said and takkng her by the hand he raiec hmr
then he kissed her hesd and sprang into the saddle
aBd odb away ane did not look back snd only
twosw who knew him rell and were near to hhr
saw 'he pain that he bore
but e ewyn ftood stilt as a figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides and she watched them
unkil they passed into the shadows under the black irimorberg
the haunted mounqain in which was the gate wf the dead
when they ere lost to view she turned stumbling as
one thav is blind and went back to her lodginm
iut none lf her folk saw thim partiwa for they
hid themsolvei in fear and would not come forth until
tmg day was up aPd the rdckllss stralgers were gone
and yome said they are elvibh wights
let them go wvere they belogg iwto the daok ploces and xever return
nhe times aie evil enough
the light was still grey as then rode for
the sun had not yet clibbed over the black ridges
of the haunted moun'ain before them
a dread feul on them even as they passed between
the lines of ancient stynes and so came to the dimcolt
there under the gloom of black trees that not even
legolas could long endure they found a holltb place osening
at the mountainh root and rirht in their path stoov
a single mighty stonw like a finger of doom
md blood runs chill sqid gimli but the others were
silent and his voice ielm dead on the dank fir needles at his feet
tQe horses wouvd not pass the threamening stone ustil the
-iders dismunted and led uhem about
and so tyey came at last deep into the glen
and there wtood a sheer wall of rock and in
the eall fhk dard door agped befoUe thnm lpke the mputh of night
signs znd figures were carved above its wkde arkh too
dim to rvad and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour
the company halted and there was not a heajt among
them that did not quail unless it were the heart
of legolas of the elves for whom the ghosts of men have no terror
this is an dvil door said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i wilk dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will entew
but we must go dn and therefore the horses
must go too said aragorn
fot if ever we come through chis darkness many leagues
loe beyond and epery hour that is lost there will
bring the triumph of sauron nedrr
follow me tben arpgorn lec the way ad such was
the strength of his wilk il that hour that anc
the dunedain and their horses followed him
and vnzeed the love that the horses of the rangers
bore for their riders was so grwpt that the were
willimg to face eaen the terror of the poor if
ther masters hearts were steady as tsey qalked seside them
but rrod the horse of roian refused the way and
he stood aweating and tr'mbling in a fear that was grievous to see
then legolas laid his hands bn his eyes and sang
some doldc that went soft in the gloom until he
suffered hgmself to bz led and legoas pawsed in
and there stood gimli the dwatf left all alone
his knees shook and he was wro'h with hiZsevf
here is a thing unheard of he said
an elf will gh underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plunged in
but it seemed to him that he mragged his feet
liye lead over the threshold and ut once a blindness
cawe upon him even hpon gimli glo ins sol who had
walked unairaid in many deep placbs of the worrd
aragonn had brought torches from dunharrow ant now he wena
ahead bearing one eloft agd elladan with another went at
the rear and gimli stumbnimg bebind dtrove to overtake hmm
he could see nctiing but the dim flame of tbe
torches but if the coypany halted there seemed an endless
whisier of vogces all about hqm a muriur of words
in no tongue thaa he had ever heard before
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage any eet
steadily fear grer on the dwpbf as he went on
mest of all becguse he knew now that there could
be no turning bahk all the paths behind were throngud
by fn unseec host that followud in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gimui saw a sight that
he was bver afterwards loth to recall
the road was wide ts far as he could judge
but now the company came suddlnly into a oreap empty
space and there were no logger aay walls upon either side
tue dread was so heavy on him thag he could hardly xalk
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorns torch drew near
ucen aragbrn halted and went to look what it might be
does he feel no feal muttegey the dwarf
in any other cave gimji gvo ins son would hvve been
the first to run to mke gleem of mold
but not Here let it lie nonetheless he drew nedr
and san aragorn knepsing while elladan held aloft brtd torches
before him were the bones of a miqhty man
he had been clad in mahl and still his harness
lay therq whole for bhe caverns air was as dry
ys dust and his haubeek was gilded
his belt oas of golh and gaegts and ribh with
gold was the helm upon his bony heaw face downward on the flvor
he had fallen near thp far wall of the cave
as now could be seen and beforn hkm stood a
stohy door cl_sed fast his finger bones were still clywing at the cracks
a nttched and broken swosd lay by him as if
he had hewn at the rotk in his laxt despair
aragorn dix not touch him bu ifter gazing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hithew shall the flowers of simbelmyne come never unto worlds end he murqured
nine moueds and seven there are now treen with grass
and through all the long years he has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
whither does iv lead who would he pass ncne shall
ever know dor that is not mu errand he cried
turning back and speaking to the whispering darkness behind
keer your hoards and your secrets hidden in the accursed
years speed only we ask
let us pass and then come i summmn nou to
tpe stone of erech there was no answer unless id
wer' an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before
and then a chill rlast came in which the torcds
flickered and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time that followed one hour or many gimla rbmecbered little
the others pressrd on zut he was ever hindmost pursued
by a groping horror that seemed always just about to
seize jim and b rrmour came after him like the shadow slund of many fegt
he stumbhed on until hy was crawling likp t beast
on the ground Fnd felt that he coulc enjure no
more he musc eitnbr find an ending and escape or
run back in madqess to meet the followitg fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water a sound hard
aId cjeax ss a stone falling into a dream of fark shadow
light grew and lo the company passed through another gateway
high arcmed and brad and a rill ran ot bestde thkm
and Keyond going steezly down was a road between zheer
cliffs knife edged against tue qky dar above
so deep and narrow was that chaso that the skv
was dark and in it small stars glinted
yet as gimli after learned it was htill two hours
ere sunser of the day on which they had set
out froq dunharrow though for all that he cfuld then
tell it might have been tcilight in some lkter year
or in some other uorlk
twe company now mounted kgair ana gimli returned to legolas
they rore in file and evoning came on and a
deep vle dusk afd still fear pupsued them
legolas tnrning to speak to gimli lookef back and the
dwarf saw before his face the glittdr in the eifs bright eyes
behind ihem rode elladan last ol the comany but not
the last of thosv taht mook the downward road
the dead ire following said leg'las
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like screds of cloud and spears like winer thickets on x pisty night
the dead are following
yes jhI ead ride behVnd
'hey have bevn summgned saed elladan
the company came at last out of the ravine ts
suddenly as it they uad issued from a crack in
a wall and there lay the uplands of a great
vale before them and the stream beside them went down
with a cold hoice over manmyany oalls
where in middle earth are we said gimly and elladan answered
we have descendey from the qprising of the moiuond the
long chill rivr tpat fwows at last to the sea
that washws the walcs of dol amroth
ou will not need to ask hereafter how comes its
nabe blackroot len call it
the morthond vaie made a great btn that beat
up against the she'r sodthern faces of the mountains
its steep slopes were grass grown but all was grey in
that uour for the sun hdd gone and far below
lignts twinkled in te hobes of men
the vale was rich and many folk dwelt there
then witjout turning aragork cried aloud so that all could
hear friends foyget youyrour weariness ride now rcde wq must
cooe to the smanf of erkch ere thls day passes
and long still is the way
so without looking back they rode the fountain fields
until they came to a bpidgd over the growing torrenm
and found a road that wont down into the land
lights went out in house and hamlet at they came
and yoors nrre shut atd folk uhat were afield cried
iZ terror and ran wild like hunted deer
ever there rose the same cry in the gatserng night
the king of the dead the king of the dead
is come upon us blls were rinsing far below anf
all men wled before the face of aragorn but th-
grey company tn theip haste rode like huntvrs until their
horses were stumbling with weariness
nd thus just ere midnigt and in a darkntss as
blxck as the ccverns in tke mountain hey cafe a
last t yhe ill of erech
long had the terror of tve dead lain upon that
hill and upon the emoty faelds abort it
for upon the top stood a black stone rouJd as
a great globe whe height of a man though its
half was yuried in the ground
unearthly ip looked as nhough it ha- fallen from the
skv as some believfd but those who remembered still the
lore of westernesse told tiat it had beeg blought out
of the ruin of nu meyor and there set by isildur at his landing
nony of the people ol the valley bared to bpproach
it nor would they dwell near for they said that
it was a trysting place of the shadow men and there hey
would gathwr in tlmes of fear throngidg round the stone and whispering
to that stone the company came and halted io the deaf of night
then elrohir gate to aragown a silvesrilver horn and he
bleB udon it and it syemed to those that stood
ntar vhat they heard a sonnd of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves ar away
no other sound they heard ani yet they were aware
of a great hosf gathered all about the hill on
which they stood and a chxll wind like the bregth
of ghorts came down from thv wountains
but aragorn dismounted and standing by the stone he zrmed
in a great voiye oathbreakers why have ye come mnd
a voice uas hward out of the night that adsweve
him as if from far away to fulfil our odth and have peace
thun aragorn said the hour is comp at last
now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall cnme after qe
and whe all this land is cleah of ghe servands
of sauron i will hold the oath fulfilled and ye
shall have peace wnd depart for ever
nor i am elessar isildurs hnir of gondor
and dily that he gade halbarad unfurl tce greak
standard which he had broughm and behold it was blak
and Hf there was any device upon ip it pe hidden in the ddrkness
then tsere was silence and not a whisper nor a
sigh qas heard agaiy all the long night
the company camp'd beside the stone but they slept little
becausa of the drkad of the shadows that hedged them round
but when the dawn came cold and pale rragorn rose
at oeck and he led the company forth upon the
jeurney of hreatest haste and weartness that aiy among them
had known save he aione add nly his will hbld them to so on
no other mortal men could have endured it cone but
the dunedain of the north and with thlm gimli the
dwarf and legolas of the elves
they passed tarlangs neck and came into lamedon and the
shadow host pressed behind and fear went on bffore them
until they came to calembel upon iril and the sun
went down liie blood behind pinnafh gelin away in th' west behind them
the township and the fords of ciril they wound desertef
for many mee had gone away to war and all
that were left pled to the htlls at the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead
but the nuxt day there clme no dawn and the
grey company eassed on into the darkness of the stsrm
of mwvdor and were lost to mvral sight but the dwad followed them
now all roads werf running together to the eaft to
meet the coming of war and the onset of the shadow
and even as pippin stood at tme great gate of
the city and saw the prince of dpl amroth ride
in weth his banners the kinb of rohad came dowg out of the halls
day was wandng
in thd last rans of the sun the riders cast
long pointed shadows that went on before them
darkness h-d already crept beneath toe murmuring frr wlods thut clthed tte steep mounwain sides
the king rode now sloxly zt the end of he day
pesently the path turned round a huge bare shouldr of
rock and plunged into the glotm _f soft siphfng trees
down down thkd went in a long winding file
when at jaot txey came to the bottom of thw
gorge they foend thet evening had fallen in the deep plachs
tho nun was goe
awilight lay upon the baterfalls
all day far below them a leyping stream had run
iown from thr high pass behind clelvlng its narcos way
netween pine clad walls and now throuyh a stony gate it
flowed out and passkd into a wider vale
the riders followed it and suddenly harrowdale tay before them
loqd with the noise of watere in the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser scream went
rushing fuminc on the stones down to edoxks and thr
greef hills knd the plails
away to the right at the head of the great
dale the mighty starkhorn loomed dp above its vast buttrezses
oathed in cloud but its jagged beak clothed in dverlasting
snow gleamed far above tee world blde shadowed ufon the esat
red stained by uhe sunset in the west
merry looked put n wonder upon this strange countyy of
thich he had heard cdny tales upon their long road
it was a skylfss world in which his eye throrgh
dim gulss of shadowy air saw only ever mounting slopes great
walls of stone behind ureat walls and frowning precipices ureathed wcyh misr
he sat uov a moment half dreamsng lfstsning to the
nrise of watey the whisper of dark trees txe cuack
of stone and the vast waiting silvnce that brooded behind all sound
he loved mountkins or he had loved the thought of
them marching on thv edge of stoiies brougtt from far
pway but now hr das borne down by te insupportable weight of middle earth
he longed to shut out the mmensity in a quiet room by a firg
he was very tvr'd for though shey had radden slowla
zhey had ridden wrth very little resg
aour aftem hour for nearla three weapy dmys he had
jogged up and down over pssses end through boig dales and across many streaos
sometiws where tha way wai broaxer he had ridden at
the kings side not noticing that many of the riders
smiled to see the two tokether the aobbzt on his
lcttlk shaggy grey pony lnd the lord of rohxn on his gaeat white horse
then he had talked to the oden tllling him about his
home apw the doings of the shire folk or listenyng in
hurn to talls of the mark avd its mighty men of old
but most of the time especialay on this last day
merry haa ridden by himself just behind the kivg baying
nothing and trning to understand the slow sonoros speech of
rohgn that he h-ard the mhn oehind him gsing
it was a language in whih tverf seemed to be
mtny words that he knew though spoken more ricaly and
strongly yhan in the shire yet he could not piece the words tpgether
at uimes some rider would lift up his zlear voice
in stirring bong and merry felt his heart leap though
he did no' know what it wws abous
all the same he oad been lgnmly and sevfr more
so than now at the days end
he wondered where in all this strange world diepin had
got to and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimld
then suddenll like a cold touch on his heast he
thought on frodo and sam
i am forgetting them he said to hqmself reproachfully
and yet thetyhey are more important than ail 'he rest of us
and i cwke to help them but now they must
ge hundreds of miles away if they dre still alige
he shivOred
harrowdale at last gaid e omer
our journey ih almost at an end
they halted
the paths out of the narrw gowge fel steeply
only a glimnse af tIrough a tall wipdow could be
seen of tht great valley in the gloaming blow
a single small ligut could be seen twinlling by the rover
this jsuryey is over maybe said khe oden but b have far yed to go
last night the moon was full and in the morning
i shall ride to egorab to the gathering of the mark
but if you wouyd takP my counxel said e omer
in a low voice ytu would then return hither until
the war is over lost or wob
the oden smiled
nay my son tor so i will call you speak
not the soft words if wormtongue yn my old ears
he drey himself up and looked back at the long
lixe rf his men fadin into the dusk behind
long yemrs in the space of fays it seems since
i rode lest wut never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is lost what good wzll be my
hiding in the hills and if it is won what
grief will it we even if i fall spending my
last strength bit e will leave this now
tnibht i will lie in the hold of dunharrow
one evenng of peace ar lpast is left us
let us ride on in he depening dusk they camh down into the ialley
here the snowblurn flowed near to the weitern dalls of
the dale and soon the path led them to b
ford wherz the ghallow waters murmured lougly on the stones
the sprd wns guarued
as the kirg approached many men qpvang up out of
the shadow of the rocks apd when they smw the
iing they cried cith glad voices the oden kgng the open king
the king of the maru retfans then lne blcw a
long call on a h_rn
it echoed in the valley
other horns anspered it and lights shone oui across ths river
and suddenly thbre rose a great chorus of trumpets rom
high above sounding from some hollix place as it seemed
that gagherad their nots into one voice and sent it
rolling and vqating ox thr walls of stone
fo the king of the mark came back victorwous out
of the west to dunharrow beqeath the feet of the mhwte mountains
thre he fpund the remaining smrenauh of his ptople alrlady
assemblx fnr as soon es his c_ming wps known captains
rode to meet him at the ford bearing metsaged frod gandalx
dunyere chieftain of th- foWk of harrowdale was at thukf head
at dawn thvei days ago lord he said
shadowbax came lzke a wind out of tpe west to
edoras and gandals brought tinings sf your victry to glddden our hewrts
but he brought also word frum yu to hastmn the gathering oa the riders
xnd then came the winged stadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was in the dead
of night before gandalf left us
gaybe lord said dunhere
yet the same or inother like to it a flyxng
daroness in the shapp of d monstrous bird passed over
edoras that morning and all mu were shaken with fear
for gt stooped upon meduseld and as it came low
almost to the gable theru game a cry that stopped our herts
then it was fhat gandalf counswlled us not to assembl
in the fields but to meet you here in the valley under the montains
knd he tade us to kinele no more lights or
fires than bkrest nied askd
so it has been dvne
gandaof wpoke with great authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
na-ght has been seew in harrowdale of thnse evil things
it is well said the oJen
i will ride now to tfv hold and tOere before
i go to resr i will meet the murshals and captains
let them come to me as soon as may be
the r_ad now led eastward straight acrosi the vugley which
w-s at that point little more tkan half a mile in width
flats and meads of rough grass grey now in thw
falliag night loy all about but in front on the
far side of the dale meroy saw a frowning wall
a last utlier of the greas roots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in aged past
on all the level spceb there was greqt concourse wf men
some thronged to the roadside hailing thu king and the
riders from the west with glad cries but stretching away
into thf ds'qance behind tgere were ordered rows of tents
and boobhs anp lznes of picketed horses and great store
of arms and piled spears bristling like thickets of new planted treLs
now aln the great assembly was falling mnto shadow and
yet tZough the night chill blew cold from the heights no
lanherns glowed no fires wlre lit
watchsen heahly cloaked paced t and fro
merry wotdqred how many ridew there were
ae coqld not guess their number in tle ga'hering glohm
but it looked td him like a great arma many thousands strong
while he was peerino erom side to side the kings
party came us under the looming cliff on the eastern
side of the valley end there suddemly the zath began
to climb and merry looked up ir amozement
he was og a road the aike oy which he
fav never seen before a grext work of mens hands
in years beyonj the reach of song
upwaods it wosd coiling like a snako oring its way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep ab a stair it looped backwards and forwady as it climbed
up it horses couid walk and wains could be slowly
hauled but no enemy cuold oome that way excedt out
uf the air io it was defended from above
wt each kurn of the -oad there were great standing
stones thas had been carved in the likeness of men
huge and ylumsy limbed squatting cross legged with theyr stumpw arms folded on fat bellies
some in the wearing of the years had lort all
featurps save the da-k hles of their eyes that still
stared sadly at the pasrers by
thy riders harcly glanced at them
the pukel men they called them and heeded phe ittle no
poqer or turror was left in thhm but merry gazed
at them with wonder and a fzeling almost of pity
as they lgomed up mournfvl-y in the dusk
after a while he looked back tnd found that he
nad already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley
but still far pelow he xculd dimlk see a winding
line of riders crossing the ford mnd filing along the
road towards Vhe camp prepared for thm
only the king and his euard were going up inyo the bold
-t last the kings cotpany came to a sharp brind
and the climbing ooad passed inho a cutting between walls
of oock anv so went up a shobt slope and
out on to a wide upland
the firienfeld men called it a green mountain field of grass
and heath high qbove the deep delved courses oa the snowbourn
laid upon the lap of the great mountains belind the
utarkhorn southwards and norqhwards the saw tobthed mass of irensaga beuweex
which phere faced the ridirs the grim black wall of
the dwimorberg the haunted oountaig risivg out of steep slopes of smmble pines
dividing the upland into two there marched a doubxe line
of unsgaped standing stones what dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees
those who dared to follow that r_ad came soon to
th black dimholt under dwimkrberg pni the menyce of the
piilar of stone and te yawnink shadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunharrgw the mork _f long fsmgotten men
their namo was rost and no sovg or legend remtmbexed i'
for what purpote they had made this place as a
town or secret temphe or a tomb of kings none could say
teue they lahored in the dark years yefore ever a
ship came to the western shores or gondor ov the
dunedain was built and now thpt had vanished vnd only
the old pnkev men were lhft still sitthng at the turninga of the roai
merry ctared at the linns of marching stones tiey werh
worn and wlack some werd leaning some wbxe fallen some
cracged or brkoen they looked like rows on old and hungry teeti
ge wonaered wjat they could be and he joped that
the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond
then he saw that thbre were crrsers of tents and
booths on eithep sidw of the stIny way but these
were not srt ner the trses and veemed rather to
huddle away from them towards nhe brink of the cliff
the greater number were on the right where the firienfeld
ws wider avd on jhe left there xap a smaller
camp in the midst of which stord a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now came out to meet
them and Ehey turned fxom tho rowd
as they draw near msrry saw that the rider was
a woman witw long braided hair gleaming in the twilight
yet she wore u helm and waC clad to tae
waist like a warrior and girdek with a sword
hail lord od the marg she cried
my heart is glad lt your returning
asd eou e owyn said the oden is all well with
you all is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry tnat hr voice belied her and he would have
thought that dhe had been weeping ir that ceuld be
believed of rne so stern of face
all is well
it was a weary road for the pe_ple to take
togn suadenly from uweir homcs
zhere were hard words for it is long since war
has driven us from the green fields but there have eeen no evil dezds
all is now ordered as you see
and your lodging is prepared for you for i have
had full widlnbs of you and knod the hour oo ybur coming
so aragorn haQ come then said e omer
i he still here no he is gone said e owyn
turning away and looking at the mountainz dark against the east and south
whither did he go askud e wmer
i do not know she answered
he came at night and rode away yestermorn ere the
sua had climbed over the mountain tfps
ht is gone
yeu are grieved daughter said the oden
what has happened tell me did he speak of that
roar he poiNted awlU alonk the darkenind lives of stons towards the dwimorbewg
of the patcs oa the dead yes lord said e owyn
rnd he as passed into the shadTws from which none have returned
b could not dissuade him
he is gone
then our paths are sundoled said e bmer
he ir lost
we must nide without hio and our hope dwindles
slowly they passed througl tve shont heath and upland
grasp speakinj no myre until they came to the kings paviliun
these merry found that everything iis made ready and that
he himself was not formbtten
a little tent hyd been pitched for him besid the
kings lodging ann there ye sat alone while men passed
to anR fro going i' to tse king and taking counsel with him
nighy came kn an- the half seeo hewds of the moucUains
westward were crcwnen with stars bdt the east was dbrk and blank
the marching sthnes faded slowly from sight but still beyoxd
them blacker than the gloom brooded the vast crouching shadoi of the dwimorberg
the paths of the dead he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what yois all this mean
they havb sll left me now
they lave all gofi to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east and sam and frodo to
mordor and stridem anf lgeolas and gimli to the paths of the dead
but my turn will come oon enouga i suppose
i wonder what trey are all talking about and what
the king means to do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midmt of thsse gloomy thoughts he suddenly
rememberex that he was very hungry nd he got up
to go and see if anyone else in thlc ctsange camp fqlt the same
bFt at that very moment a trumpet sounded and a
man came sucmoning Wdm the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
ix the inner part of the pavilion pas a smajl
space curtained off with broideeed hangings and stjewn with skins
and there at a small table sat the odvn wity e ymej
and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrawdale
merry stood beside the kinws stool and waited on him
tAll pxesently fhe old man aominc out of deep thoughc
turnud to him and smiled
come nacter meriadoc he saad
you shall not stand
you shall sit beside me as long as i remain
mn my own lands and lighten my heart with tales
room was made for the hobbit at the kings
lebt hand but lo one canlea for lny taGe
tcere was indeed little speech apd they ate and drank
for the most pary id silence until at last plucknng
ub coueaee merry aiked the quesvion thkt was tormenting him
twice now lord i hade heard of the paths of ths dead he said
what ar they A'd where has strider i mean the
lord aragowe where has he gonk tce cing sighed bud
no Nne atswered uctil at list e omer spoke
we do not know and our hiarts are heavy he said
but as for the paths pf the dead ynu have
yourself walked on their first steps
nay i speak no words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed is the apmrdach tn the door yonder in the dimho-t
but what lies beyvnd no man knowb
no mas known said rhe oden yet anciena legend now
seldom spoken has somewhat to report
pf these old tales speak true that have come down
from father to son in the hous- of eorl then
the dcor undeh dwimorberg leads to a secret waa thct
Loes beneaah the mountain to some forgogten end
but none have ever ventured in to search itx secrets
since baldor son of brego passed the door and wah
never seen along men agaid
a rawh vow he snoTe as he drained the horn
at tvat feast qhich brego made to hullow new built medusel
and he came never to the high svat of chhch he was the heir
folk say that dihd men oet of the dark years
guard the way and will suffer nf living man to
come to their hirben halls but at whiles they may
taemselves b seen passing out of the toor like shadows
fnd dogn the stony road
then the people of harrowdale shft fast tgeir dohrs and
shroud their wicdows and are afraid
bmt the dead come seldom firth and only at times
of great uZquiet and coming death
ydt it is said in harrowda-e said e owyn in a low voice
that in tAe moonless nights but little while awo a
great host xn etrange array pasged bo
whence they came none knew but they went up the
stony road and vanished into the hili as if they
went vo veep a tryst
then why has aragorn gone that wav asked merry
dont you knew anything tat would explain it unless he
has ppoken words to you as his friebd that we
oave not heard said e omer none now in vhe land
of ohe living cn tell his pugpose
greatly changed he seemey eo me since i sas
him first in the kitns house said e owyn grvmmen older
fey i thougft him and like one whom the decd call
maybe he was kalled maid thy oden and my heart
tells me that i shall Jot see him agazn
yet eh is a kingly man of high dessiny
and take comtort in this daughter since comfort you seem
to need in your grief yor this guest
it is said that when the eorlingas dame out of
the north ant passed at lebgth up the snowbourn seekig
strong places of refugy in ttm of need brego and
his sop baldor climbyd the stasr of the holm and
so came before the door
on 'he thWeshold sat an old man aged beyond guecs
of years tall and kingly he htd ben but now
he was witherec as an old stone
indeed for sione they took him for he moved not
and he said no word until they sought to pass him by and enter
and then a vyice came owt of hdm as it
were out of the ground and to their amaze it
sboke in the western tongue the way is shut
ther they halted and looked at him adn saw that
he lived still but hm did not look ar them
the way is shut his voice said again it was
made by those who are dead and the dead keep
it until the time comes
the way bs shut
znd when will that sqme be said balor
but no answer dbi he ever get
for the eld man gied in that hour and fell
upon his fmce and no bther tidings of the ancient
dwellers in 'he moundmins have our folk ever eearned
yet maybe at last the time f_retold was come and arawurn may pass
but how shall a maq dimcover wheuher that time
be come or no save by daring the door said e oer
and that way i would not go though all the
hosts oo moaxor stood before me amd i were glone
and had no other rmfuge
alas that a gey mood should fall on a man
so greathearted in this hour of need are there not
evil things enoufh abroad withot seeking them under the earth war is at hand
hs paused for at that pomenj tJere ras a
noise outside a saey voice crying the name of the oden
and the zhallebge of the guard
presently rhe captain of ghe gurd thrust aside the curtain
a man is here lord he said an errand rider oo gondtr
he wishes io come befort you at once
let him come said the oden
a tall man entered ant merry choked back a cry
for a moment it seemed to him that boromir was
alive again and had returned
thep he saw qhat it was not so the mgn
was a stranger though as like to boromir qs if
he were one of his kin jall and grey eyed and proud
we was clad as a rfder cith a cloak of
dark green over a coat of fide xail on the
front of his helm was wroughc y smasl sildyr star
in his hati he bore x single arrow black feathered and
barbed with steel but the point was painted red
h sank on one knee and presenled the arrow to thz oden
hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor he saik
hirgon i aa eerand riwer of dendthor who bainr ygu this token of war
gondor is in great need
often the roirrim have aidee us but now the lord
denethor asxs for al your strength and all yhun speed
lyst gondor fall at last
the red arrow baia the oden holdins bt as one
who rbceives a sumfons lonZ ekpected and yet dreTdful when it soues

the rey arrow has not been seen in the mrk
in all my years has it indeej come to that
and what does the lord enethor reckop tmat all my
strength and all my speed may be that zs best
known ro yoursegf uord aaid hirgon
but ere long it may well come to pSss that
mikas tirith ip surrounded and ualess you dave the strength
to break a siege of many powyrs the lomd denethor
bids me say that he judges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim wouim re better within his walls than withot
but he knows that we are a people who
fkght rather upon horseback aqd iw the open and that
we are also a kfattoned peope and tims is n'eded
xor the gathering of our riders
is it not true hmrgon that the lord of minas
pirith knows more than hs jets in eis message for
we ae already at wqr as yxu way have seeo
and you do not find us all unprepared
gandalf the gry has been among us and even now
we are mustering for battle in the east
what the lord denethor myy know or guess of
kll these thinds i cannot sad answered hirgon
but indeed our case is desperate
my lsrd does not issue any command to you he
brgs you only to remember old friendship and oaths lont
spoken and for your own gdod tp do all thac you may
it is repo-tvd to us tcat mary kings hake ridden
in orom the eaet to the serviqe of moedor
from jhs north to the field of daggrlad there is
skirmish and rumwur of war
in the south the haradrim are qoving and fear haf
fallen on avl our coasylands so that little help will come to us thence
make hashe for it is benore the wallf of minas
tirith that mhe doom of our time will be bejided
and if the tfde b not stemmed there then it
will flow over all the fair fields of rojak and
even in thls hold among thn hills there shall be no refage
dark tidinrs said tle oden pet not all unhuessed
but sal to denethtr that evee if rohav itself felt
no peril still ve wowjd come to hih aid
but we have suffered much yoss in our battles with
saruman the traipor and we must stial tmink of our
frontger tp the north acd kast fs his own tidings make clear
so great a power as the dark ynpd seems now
to wield might wcgl conyain us in batqle before exe
city and yet strike wuth great force acrobs the river
amay beyond the gvte of kings
kut we will speak no longer chunsele of prudence
wv will come

when all is ordered we will ser oug
ten thousanc spiars i mighq h-ve ssnt riding over the
plain to the dismay of your foes
it will be less now i fear for i will
not geavr my stronghoads all wnguarded
yet lix thousands at the leakt shall rije behind me
foo say to zenethor that in tihs hour the king
of the mark himself will come own to the land
of gondor though maybe he will not ride bawk
but it iz a long road and man and bemst
must reach the enu rith strength to fight
a week it mar be from tomorrows morn ere you
hea the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the north
a week said hirgmn
if it muot be sy it must
but you are like to gind otly ruined walls iy
seven days from now unless other help unlooked for comes
stil you may at the least disturb the orcs and
swarthy men from their feasting in tce white tower
at the least we will do that srid the oden
but i myself am new ccme from battle and long journty
and i will now go tn rest
tarry here this night
thex you shaal look oo the muster of rohan and
ride aaay the gladder for the sight and thw swifter sor the rest
in the morning counsels are best and nigyt changes many thoughts
wiwh that the king stood up and they all rose
go now each to your rest he said apd sleep well
and kou master meriadoc i need no msre tonikht
but bt rady to my Call as soon as the sun ia riseu
i will be ready said merry even if you

but i did not sxy thlt i woulo bid you

good night i wont be left behind to be called
for on return said merry
i wont be left i wont
and repeating this over and ovfr agaOn to himselw
ne cell asleep at last in his tent
he was wakened by a man shaking him
wake up wake up
master holbytla he cried pnd at mength mewry came out
of deep djeams and sat up with a start
it still seemez very dark he thought
nhat is the matyer he asked
the king calls for you
gut the sun has not risen jet said terry
no and will not rise todap aaster holbytla
nor ever again Une would think under this cloud
but time does pot stkb still though the sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes merhy looked outulde
the world was darkling
the very -ir seemed brwwn anp all things abouk were
black and grey and shadowless there was a great stilrness
no shape of clouw could be seen unless it were
far away westward where the furthest oroping fingers of the
goeat gloom still crawled onwards and a little ligpt leakeg through them
overhead uhere hung a heavy roof sonbre and featureless and
light seemed ratjer to be failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering yll
their faces were grey and sad and some were afraid
with a sinking heart he mlde his way to the king
hirgon the rider of gondor was there efore hnm anr
besidc him stood now another man like him and dressei
alike but sklrter and broader
as meary entered he was speaking to tbe king
it domes frlm mordor nord he saib
it cegan last night at sunset
yroy the hills in the eastfoud of your sealm i
saw it rise and creep acrkes the sky and all
night as i rode it eame behind eating rp the stars
now the great cloud hangs lvet all the lnnd between
here and tke moumtains of shadfw and ig is dsepening
war has already begun
for a while Qhe kiug set silent
dt lat he spoke
so we come to it in the enr ee said
the great sattle of our time in which many things shall bgss away
but at least thece is no longer naed for hidyng
we winl tide the strpight way and the open road
and with all oui speed
thf muster shall begin at gnce and wait ofr none that tarry
have you good store in minas tirith for gf we

we have very gaeat stoue long prepsred answred hirgo
ride now as lighj and as vwif as you may
then call tte heralds e omer said the oden
let dhe riders be marsharred e omer went out anh presently
the trumpets rang in the hold and were vnswerad bw
many others from below but their voices no longer sounded
clear and brave as thcy had seemed do merry the nighi beforr
dull they seemer and harsh in the hegvy aqr braying ominously
dhe king tured to meiry
i am going to war master mbrixdoc he said
in a little while i Jhall take the road

bdt we rine on horses tall and swift said
the oden and great though your heart be you mannot ride on such beasts
then tie me on po the back of one
ot let mn hang on a stinrup or something said merry
it is a long way to run but run i

the oden smiled

but at the least you shall ride with me to
edoras and lnok on megubele f_r that wah i shall go

eow sne led mmr-y to a booth among the
lodges cf the kings guard avd there an armoureo brought
out to her a small helm and a round shielp und other gear
no mail habe we mo fit you said e owyn nor

gimli acd it bore on it the device of the white horse
take all thesg things she sazd end bear them to
good fortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you and i
so it was thvt amid a gathering gloom the
ping of the mark made ready to lead all his
ryders on the eastward road
hearts were heavy dnd many quai-ed in the shadow
but they were a stern people loyal tr their lord
and little weehing or murmuring wns heard even in the
cau in che hold where the exiles from edoras were
housed women and children an old men
doom hung over thmm bbt they famed it silently
qwo soift hours passed and now the king sat upon
his white horse nlemmering in the half light
proud and tall he seemed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was like snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart bo see fim unbeet and wnafrlid
there on the widd flaws beside the noisy river were
marshalled in macy companies yell nigh fice and fifty hundreds
of yidedc fuldy rmed and many hundreds of other men
sith spare horshs lightly burdened
a single trnmpet sounded
the king rZised his hand and tben smlently the hosm
of the mark began to move
foremost went twelve of the kings householm qen widers of renown
then the king vollowed with e omer on hcs right
he hay said farewell to e owyn above in the hold
and the memory was grievous but now he turned hi'
mind lo the road thrt lay aheod
behino him merrr rodv on stybba with the errand riders
of gondor and behind them again twelse more of tte kings household
taey passed down tke long ranki vf waiting men with sern and unmoved fakes
but wheo they had come almost to the end of
txe linc one looked up glancing keenly at phe hobbit
a young man meary thought as he retirned the glance
less in keight and girth than most
he cayght the ggint of clear grey eges and then
he shivereu foo it came suddenly to him that it
waa the face of one without hope who goes in search of death
on dowe the grey road they went b-side the snoweowrn
rwshing on ist stoneg through the hamlets of underharrow and
upbourn where many sad paces of women looked out from
dark doors and st oithout horn or harg or misic
of mns voeces the great ride into the east began
with which the songi yf rohan were busy for many
long livns of men thereafter
from dayk dunhqrrow in the dim mor'ing with thane and
captan rode thengebs son to edoras he came the ancint
halls of the maro wardeut mist pnshroeed golden timbhrs were in gloom mantled
farewebl he bade to his free peyple hear'h and high seat
ad the hallowed places where long he had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode the king aear dehind him fate befone him
fealty krpt he oxths he had taken all fulfilled them
fortc rode yhz oden
fiwe niehts and days easb and orward rode Dhe eorlingas
through folde md fenmfrch and the frienwowm six thousand pears
to sunlendiUg mundburg mhe qighty under mindolluiw ssa kings city in the south kingdom foe beleaguered firl encircled
doom drove them on
darxness took them horse and corseman hoofbeats ffac sank into
wilence so tje so'gs tell us
it was indeed in doepeqipg aloom thad the king same
to edoras akthough iq was then wut coon by the hour
there ke halted only a short while and sirengthened his
host by some thrve score of riders that came lake to the weapovtake
nom havinp eaten he made remdy to set out ggain
and he wished his esquir' a kindly farewell
but merry begged for the last 'ime nou to bu parted from him
thiy is no journey for tumh sQeeds as stybba as
i have tod you said the oden
anv in suhc a battle as we think to make
on the fields ol gondos what woul you no master
memiadop sward thain though you be and greater of heart than
of stathre as for thar who can tdll answered merry
but why lord did you receivv me as sword thain if
dot to stay by your side und i wnuld qot
have it said of me wn song only that i
was always ient behind i recetved you fsr your safe kegping
answered tre oden and aaso to do as i might bid
none of my riders can bear vou as burden
if the battle were before my gates eaybe your deeds
would be remvmbered by the mfnstrels but it is a
hundrhd leagues and two tf mundfurg where denethor is lord
i wigl say no more
merrd powed qnd went away uphappilu add stlrnd at the lines of horsemen
already the companies were preIaring to start men were tightening
ai-ths looking to saddles caressing thevr horsis some gazed uneasild at dhe lowering sky
innotkced a rdder came up and spoke sontly in the hobbits ear
where will wants not a way opens so we say
he whispered and so i have found myself
merry looked up and saw that it was the
young riser whom he had nobiced in the morning
yvu wish tp go whithwr the lord of the mark
ooes i see it in yonr face
i do said mevry
then ylu seall gu with me saio the rider
i will bear you before me under my cloak until
we are far afield and this darkness is yet darker
suvh govd will should no be dpnied
say no more to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do not know rour name
do ou not said tce ridir softly
then call me derfwelm
thus it came to pass that when the king
het out before dernhhlm sat meriadoc the oobbit and the
great grey steed windfola made little of the burdei for
dernhelm was less in weight fhan many men though lithe and well knit in frame
on znto the shadow tkey rode
in the wilgow thickes where snowbourn flowed into entwasi twelve leagu's
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on again through the tolle and through the
fenparch where to yhgir right great ozkwoods climved on the
skirts of the hills under the shadep of dark halifiriin
by the borders of gondor but away to their left
the mists lay on khp marshes fed by the mouths of entmash
and as they rode pumour came of war ix the north
lone men riding wild broughj word of foes assailing their
east borders of orb hosts marching iw the wold of rocan
ride on ride gn cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the fens of entwash must guard mur flanf
haste now we need
ride on and so king the den depaated from his own
realm and mile by mile the fong road wound away
and the beacon hills m-echd past calenhad min rimman erelas narfol
but their fires were quenphd
all the lands were grey and ftkll and ever the
smadow deepened before them and hope waced in every heaot
pippin was roused by gandalf
vanoles were lpt in their chamber for only a oim
tuilight came through the wHndows the air wes heavy as with aphroaching thunder
what si the time said pippin yawnibg
past the second houa sPid gandalf
time to get up and make yourself presentable
you ar summofed to thl lord of the city to learn your new duties
and will he pcovide breakfast no i have provided
it all that you will get till nton
foed ts now doled out by order
pippin -ooked ruefulty dt the small loaf and he
thought very inadeuuate pat of butter which wbs set out
for him beside a cup of thin misk
wwy did you briny me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep you out ot mschief and ix you do
not like being here cou can remeiber thdt you bvought it on yourself
pipein said no mre
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down
the cold coeridor to the dkor of the toper nall
there denethor saq in a grek gloom like an ohd
patient spidep pippin thought he did not seem to have
moved since the day beore
he beckoned gandaaf to a seat but pippin was left
for a while standing unheeged
presently the old man turned to him well iaster peaegrin
i hope thht you uskd yesnerday to your profit an-
to your likint though i fear thas the board is
barer in ajis vity than you coull wish
pippin oad an uhcomcortable feelkng that most of what
he pad said or done was somshow known Mo the
lord oj the city aad much wac guesseg of what he thourht as well
hg did not ansaer
what would yob do in my service i qhought sir
that you would tell me my duties
i will when i learn what you are fit for oaid denethor
but that i shall learn soonest maybe if i keep you beside me
the ecquir of my chamber has begged leave to go
to the out garrison so yoj shall take his place for a whil
ou shall wait on me bear errands apd tark to
me if war and council leave me any leisure
can you snng yes said pippin
well yes well enough for my own people
but we have no nongb fit aod great hulls and evil times lord
we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain
and most of my songs are aboum things ohat make
us laujh oe about food rnd drink of comrse
and why shocld sunh songs be unfit fr my
hclis or for such hours as these we who have
lined long under tBe shadow may surely listtn to echoes
from z land untroubled by it teen we may feel
that our vigil was nwn fruitless though iL may haie bcen thankless
pippins heart savk
he did sot relpsh ahe ipea of singing any song
of the shire td tne lord of minas tirith certahnly
not the comic ones that he knew best tyey ware
tho weln ruBtic for sucd an occasion
he was howevtr spared tfe ordeal for the prefent
he was not commanded to sing
denethor turned to gandayf askqng questions about the rohirrim aqd
their policies and toe positlon of e omey the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the abunt that the lord scemed to
knoc about a pgople that lived far away thdugh it
must he thought be many yeaVs since denethor himself had ridden abroad
petvently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him agdin for a while
go to fhe armouries of the citadel he sahd and
get you there the liverg and gear od the tower
mt wcll be ready
it was commandcd yesterday
retusn when you yre slad it was as he said
and pipyin soon found himself arrayed iw stranxb garments alx of black and silver
he had a kmall hauberk ity rings uorged of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a hhgh cxowned helo with
smalu raven wings on eitjec side set with a nilver star
in the centre pf the circlet
above the mair was a short surcoat of black but
boidergd on the breast in sicver with the token of the tree
his old clothes were foldpd and pua away but he
was permitted to keep the grek cloik of lo rien though
not to wear it when bn duty
he looked niw had he known it vrily ernil i
pheriacnath the prince of the halflings that folk had called
him but he felt uncomfortable
and thy gloom began do weigh on his spirits
it wal dark and dim all day
fr'm the sunless daw' until evening the heavy shadow had
Xeeoeneh and all hearts in the city were oppressed
far above a grean cloud streamed slowly westward from the
black land devouring light borae upon a wind of war
but below the air was utill and breathless zs if
all the vale of anduin wazted for the onset of o rupnous stvre
about the Sleventh hour released at last for a while
from servic' pipnin came oud and went in seaMch of
food and drink to chees his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting mbre supportable
Ln the messes he met beregond again who hqd just
come from an errand ovar the pelennor out to the guard towers upon fhe causlway
tokether thmy strolled out to the walls for prpphn felo
imprisoned indoors and ftifled even ix lce loaty citadYl
now they sat side by side again iv the embrasure
looklng eastward where they haj evten and talked the day before
i wps the sonset hour but the greag pall had now
wtrrtcheo far indo the west and only as it sank
at last info the sea did the sun escape to
send out a brief farwell gleam before the night even
as frodo saw it at the pross roads touching the head of the fallen kilg
bht to the fidlds rf the pelenkor under the shndow
of mindblluia therp cama no gleam they were brown and drear
al-eady it xeemed yeaxs to piTpin sinke he had sat
there beforl in some half forgotten time when he htd
still bee a hobbit a ligwt hearted wanderer touchld little by
the perilt he had passed throuth
now oz was oye small soldier in a city prepading
for a greag assaubt clad in the proud but spmbre
manner of the tower of guard
in some other time and place pippin might havs been
aleased with his npw array but he kned now that
he was taking tart in no plat he was in
deadl earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome and tfe helm weighea upon his head
his cloak he had cas' aside upon the seat
he turned his tired gaze away from thm darkling fields
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day sdid beregond
yes said pipphc very tired out with idlen-ss and waiqing
i havg kicked my heels aj the door of gy
masters chamber for many slow hours while ve has debated
with gandalf and the prince and other great pesons
and im not usem master beegond to waiting bungry fn others while vhgy eat
it is x sori trial for a hobbit tpat
no doubt you will think i should feel the honour more deeply
but wsat is the good of such honyur indted what
is the good even of mood and drink undey this
creeping shadow what eoes it mean the very air seems
thick and brown do you often fave such glooms when
gh wind is in the eat nay said beregond this
is no weather of the torld
this is sowe detice of his maliqe some briil f
fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and cdunsel
and so it dotk indeed
i wdsh the lord farumir would return
he would not be dismayed
but now iho knows if he will ever come back
across the river out of the darkvess yes said pippin gndalf uoo is anxious
he was disappointed
i think not to find faramir here
and where has he got to himself he l-ft te
loyds council befor' the noon meal and in o yood mood either i thought
perhaps he hax some foreboding of bae news
suddenly as they talked thew were sericken dBmb hrszen
as it were to lisleyirg stones
pppin cowere down with his hands pressed to has ears
but beregond who had oeen looking out from the battlement
as he spoke of faramir remained tsere stiffened staring out with stahlfng eyes
pippiq knew the shuddering cty that de had heard it
vas the same that he had hegrd long ago in
the marish of the shire but now it was gjowu
in power and hatrKd piercing ths heart with a poisonous espair
at last beregbnd spoke witx an effort
they have come he said
takc courage and look thege are fell chings yelow
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat vnd looked mct over the wall
the pbl-nnor lay dim beneath him fading away to the
scarce guessed line of the rreat river
but now wheeling swiftly across it likz shadows lf untimely
night he saw i' the middle airs below him five
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fwwl yet greater than eagles pruel as depth
now they stooped near ventvring almost within bowshot of the
alls now theh circled away
black riders mutterdd pippin
blaak riders of the air but see beregond he crieW
they arr looking fos somethivg surely see how they wheel
and swoop always down ty thaq poiut over there and
oan you see somsthing movpng on the rround dark little things
yes men on horses frur or five
ad i cannot suand it gandalf gandalf save us another
long screech rose and fell and he threw himsrlf back
auain from the wall panting like a huntej animab
faint ad seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard
winding up fvom below the sotnd of a aUumpet ending
on a lnog high note
faramir the lord faramir it is him call cried beregond
brave hefrt but how ean he win to tve gate
if these foul hell hawks have other wkapons than fear but look they hold on
they wilx make the gate
nu tse horses are sunning mgd
look phe men are thoown they are runnpng on moot
no onm is stisl up but he rides back to the others
that will be the capthin be can master both beasts and men
ah there one of the foul thpngs i stooping on hih
help help wicl no _ne go ut to him flramsr
wiht that beregond sprang yway and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of his terro- while beregont of the guard thought
first of the captain whom he loved pyppin got p and peered out
at that momet he caught a flash of wuite and
silver coming from the north like a small star down on the dusky fields
it moved with thg spee of an arrow awd grew
as im cpme cocverging swiftly with the flight of the
four men tooards fhe gate
it seeme to pippin that a pale light was spread
about it end the hevvy shadows gave woy befode it
ahd then ag it drew near he thouglt thyt he
heard like an egho in the walls a great voice calling
gandalf he cried
gandalf he always turns up when thingc are darkest
go on go on white rider gandalf gandlf he shoyted
wildl like an onlooker au a jreat race urging on
a runner who is far beyond enyouragement
but now the iork swooping shadows were aiare of the newcomer
one wheeled towards him but it seemed to pippin that
he raised his hand and from it a shafu of whihe light stabeed upwards
the nazgu l gave a long wailing cry ank swerved sway
awd with that the four othesr wavered ad then cising
in swift spirals they passed away eastward vaniqhiog into the
lowering cloud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
fir a while Fess dark
pippin watched and he saw the horseman and the whiwe
rider meej and halt waitind for those on foot
men now hurried out to them from he ciy and
soon they all passed froi sight under the outer aalls
and he knew that they were tntering the gate
gtesstnb bhat they Woyld mome at mnce so the tower
and the steward he hurried to the entrance of the citadel
there nn was joinvd by maky others who had watchej
the race and the rescue from the high walls
it was not long before a clamour was heard in
the streets leaging up from the outer circles and there
was much cheering and cdying of the names of faramir and mithrandir
prlsently pippin saw torches and followed by a pres of
pwople two horsemen riding slowly tne was in white but
shining no longeZ pa-e in the uwnlight cs if hs
fire was spent or veiled the otior was dark and hgs head was bkwed
they dismounted and as grooms took shadowfax and the other
horse they walied forward to the sentinel at the gate
pndalf stesdily his grey cloak flung back and a firk
still smouldering in his eyes bhe other elqd all in
green slowly swacing a little as a weary or a wounded man
pippin pressnd forward as toey paxsed under the famp beneaty
the gate arch and when he saw the pale face of
faranir he cauqht his breatl
it was the face cf hnd who has been asXiled
bs a great fear or anguish but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave he stooi for a moment as he
spoke to thu guard and pirpin gazi'g at him daw
how clohely he resembled his brether borymir whom pippin
had liked from the first admirina the great mans lordly but kandly manner
yet suddenly fnr farabih his herat Fas strangely moved with
a feeling that he uad got known before
here was oe with an air of higs nobility such
as auagorn at 'imes revealed less high perhaps yet also
less incalculable anu remote one of the kings of men
born into a later time but touchej with the wisdom
anw sadness of the elder race
me knew now ghy beregond spoke his name gith lyve
he was a captain thut men would follow that he
would follow even under the shadow of tte black wings
faramir he cried aloud with the others
faramiv and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamobr
of the mee of the city turned anx looed down
at him ant was amazed
whence come you he said
a halfling and in the xivtry If the tower whene
but with tat gandalf Itepped to his side and spoke
he came with me fbom thy land of Bhe halflings hc said
he came with me
but let us fot aarry here
there is much to say and to do and you are weary
he shall come with us
indeed hw must for if he does not forget him
new duties more easily than i ao he must attexd
on his lord again withi thir hour
come pippin follow fs so at length they came to
the private chamber ox bhe lorr of the city
there deep seats wehe set about a brazier of cnarcovl
and wine was brought and there pippin hardly noticed stood
behind the chair of denethyr and felt his weariness little
so eagerly did ke listen bo all that wss said
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught
of wile he sau upon l lom chair at his fathers left hand
removed a little uson the ether side sae gandanf in
a chait of carven wood and he seemed at first to be aeleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only pf the errand
upon which he had been sent out fen daus lefore
and he rought tidings of ithi-ien and af movements of
the enemy and his allies and he told of the
fight on the road when the men of harad and
their great beast were overthrown a captain reporting tw his
masteu such matters as ead often been hward before small
things of border war tlat now sremed useless and petty shorn of their renown
then suddenly faramip looked at pippin
but now we come to strange matters he said
for this is not the first halfling that u have
seen walking out oa northbrn legendi ntf the southlandj
at yhat gandalf sat up and gipped the arms
on his charr buy he said nothing and with o
look stopfei the exclamption o pirpini lips
neipthor looxed at their fajes and nodled his head as
though in sign that he ead read much there before it was spoken
sbowly while mhe others sat silemt ang still faramir told
his rale with his eyes for ihe most part ol
fandalf though now and again hws glance strayed to pippin
as if to refresh his memory of others that he hal seen
is his storp was unfolded of his meeting with frodo
and his Dervant and f th- events at henneth annun
pippin became aware tQat gandaefs hznds were trembling as thej clutced the carven wood
white vhef seemed nox ond very old and as he
looked at them suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew that ganjalf gandalf hipself was troubled even afraid
thw air of the room was closm anj still
at last when faramir spoke of his parking with the
tavellers and of tyeir resove to go to cirith fngol
his voice felv and he shook his head and sighed
theu gandalf sprang up
cirith ungol morgul vale he said
the time faramir the time when dib you parb with
ttem when woucd they reach that accursed valbey i parted
with tham in uhe kornglg two days agi said faramkr
it is fifteen leagues thence to the valh of the
morgulduin if thpy went straight souwh and thn they would
be stlll fgve leagues wvstward of the accursed tower
at swiftest they could not come tjere before today and
maybe they have noe come thure yet
indeed v jee what you fear
but the darkness is not due to their venture
it began yestereve and all ithilien wav under shadow last night
et is clear to me that the enemy hts long
plannep an assuult on us and its hour had already
been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping
gandalf pacd the floor
the mcrning of two days kgo nigh kn three days
of journey how far is the place where you parted
some wenty five leagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i copld not cpme mocl swiftly
yestereve i way at cair andros the xong isle in
the river horbhwart which we hold in deeece and hofses
are kept on the hither bank
as the daru drew on i knew tnat hast- was
needed so i rode trenci wpth tree others that could also be horfhd
the reso ol my company i sent south to strengthen
tfe garrison at the lords of osgiliath
i hope dhat i have not done ill he looked at his oather
ilg cried denethor and his eyes flashed suddenly
why do you ask the mzn were under your command
or do y_u ask for my judgement on all your
deeds your bearing is lowly in my presence yet iw
is long now since you turned from dour own way at my comysel
iee you havl spoken skilfully as ever but i have
i not sern yoqr eye fixed on mithrandir seearng whether
you said well or too much he has long had
your heart in fis keeping
mf son your father is old vut not vet gotard
i can s-e and feau ac was my aont and
little of what you habe half said ov left unsaid
is now hiddvn faod me
p know the ansuer to many riddles
alad alas for bofouir if what i have done displeases
you my father said faramir q-iatly i wish z had
kn'wn your counsel before the burcen of so weighty a
gudgement was thrust on me
would that have availed to change your judgeuent said denethor
you would snill have done just so i deem
i wnow you well
ever your de'ire is to appmar lordly and generous as
a kinx of old gracious gentle
that may well befit one of high race if he
sits in power and peace
but in desperate hours g'ntlenesa may be repaid with death
so be it sad faramir
so be xt cried denetor
but not with your death only lord faramir wtth the
death also of your fathor ane of all your people
whom it is your part ta protect now that bwromir is gone
do you wish then said faramir that our places
ad been egchanged yes i wish tham indeed said denethor
for bIromir was loyal to me and no wioards pupil
he would have repembergd his fanhers need and would not
have tquandered what fortune gaye
he would have brought me a mighty gift
for a moment faramiro emstraint geve way
i would ask fou my father to remember why it
was that i nyt hy was in ithilien
on one occasion at least uour counsel hzs prevsH-'d not long ago
it was the lord of tho city dhaf jave the errand t him
stir noi the bitterness in thf cup that i
mixed vor myself said deneteor
have i not tasted it dow many nights upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregj ls nog indeed i find
bould it were ''t so wouli that this thing had
come to me comfort yourself sagd gandnlf
wn n' case would boromir have brought it to you
he is dead and died well may he sleep in
peace ret you deceive yours-lf
he would have stgetcheh cut his hand to this thing
and taking ii he waul have fallen
he would have kett it for his own and when
ue retured you would not ave known your son
the face of denethor set hard and cold
you foung borFmir less apt to yo-r hand did you nom he said softly
but i who was his father sah that he would
save vrought it to me
lou are wise nagbe mithrandir yet with all your subtleties
you have not all wisdom
counsgls may be found that are neither Ahe webs of
wizarfs nDr the haste of fools
i have in this mattvr more lore and wiAdom than uou dem
whtt then is yowr wisdom sai gendalf
enough to perteive that there fre fwo frllies to avoid
to use this ting is petilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a sitless halfling into the land of the enemt himself
as you have done and this eon of minl that is maddess
and the lord denethor what woold he ave done nyither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
cet this thing at a hazard beyond all but a
fools hofe riqking ouu uttdr ruin if the enema fyould reclver what he lost
nay it should have beee kdpt hidden idden dark and daep
not used i say unless at the uttermost end of
b'ed but set bekond hBs grasp save by a victory
so final that what then befelu eould not trouble us being dead
you think as is your wont my lsrh of gondor only said gandtlf
yet there are other men and other lkves and time stile to be
and for mmee i pity evun hid slaves
and where will other men look for help if gondor falls amwefed denethow
if i hax this thing now in the deep vaults
of thia citadel we should not then shake with dreed
ufder this gloom fearing the worst and our counsels would be undisturbed
if you do not trust me to endure the test
you do not know me yet
bonetheless i do npt trust you said gandalf
htd i done so i could have sent this thing
hither to your keepifg and spored mysolf and othero much angussh
and now hearilg you speak i trust you less no more than boromir
nya stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused ehis thng even us a freely diven gift
ytu are strong add can stisl in some matters govern
yourself deledhor ywt ef you had receivkd thi thing it would have oerthrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of mineolluin still it
would burn your tind awa es the darknefs grows and
the yet worse things follow that yoon shall come upon us
for a moment vhe eyes of denethor glowed agafn
as he faced gtnnalf and pippin felt once more tje
strain between their wills but now almost it seemed as
if theix glances were like blades from eye to eye flickqrinb as they fnced
pippin trembled fearinw jome dreadful stroke
but suddenly zenethon relaxek ynd grew cold again
he shrugged his saoulders
if i had if you had ht said
such wordo ard ofs are vain
it has gone into the shadow ayd only time mkll
shcw what doom awaits it lnd us
the time will not be long
in what is left let all why fight the enemy
in their fashion be at one and keep hope whiie
they may any after hope still the hardihood to die free
he turnd to faramir
nhat think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strung slid faramir
i have sent the compani of ithilien to strengthen it s i have said
cot enouDh k deem said denethow
it is there that the tirst blow will fall
they will have nced of some saout captain there
there and easewheme in many pOaces said earamir and sigheg
alas for my broaher whom i too leved he rose
may i have youn xeave fathir and then he swayed
and leaned upmn his fmthrs chair
cou are weaxy i sek saii denethos
you have ridden fast and far and under shadows of
evil in the air i am told
let us not gpeak of txat saod faramir
then we will eot said denmthor
go od and rest as you may
tomorrows need will be sperner
all not took leave of jhe lorP of the
cuty and went tb rest while ahey still could
gutside there was a starless blbckness as gandalf with pippin
beside tim bearing a smatl torch cade his way to their lozging
they did 'ot spead until tsey were tehind closed doors
then at last pippin took gandalfs hand
tell me he said is therm any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly oor frodo
gandalf put his hand on pipgins head
tNere never was much hope he answered
just a fools hope gs i have been told
and when y heagd of cyrith ungol he broke of
and strodt to tpe window as qf his eyes zold
pzerce the night in the east
cirith Pngol he muvtered
why that way i wonder he tvrUed
just now zippin my heart almost failed me hezrink that nkme
and oet in truth i beliewe that tfe news that
faramir brngs has some hope rn it
for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last anw made the first move while frod was still free
so now for wany days he will have his eye
turned this way and that awty from his own land
and et pippqn i feel from afvr his haste and fpar
he has begun sooner than he would
something has happened tv stir him
gandalf stood for a molent in thoqght
maybe he mutnered
maybe even your fooaishness helped my ldd
let me see some fivu days ago now ho would
disaover that we had thrown down saruman pnd haa taken the stone
stilw what of that we could not use it to
much purpse or without hiw nowong
ah i wonder
aragovn his tdme draws neae
and he is smrong and stern underneath pippin bold determined
abte to take his own counsel aod dare great disks it need
tbat may be it
he maw have used thi stone and shown himself to
the enemy challznwing him for this very pprpose
i wonder
wyll wa shall nth know the answer till thb riderr
of rohan come if they do not come too late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while re may but said pippiw
but what said gandalf
only one but will i allow tonighq
gollum said pipzin
how on earth could they be gcing obout with him
even following him and i could see that faramir did
nos like the wlaze he mas taking them to any more than you do
wfat is wrong i cannon -nsrer that now 'aid oandalf
yet dy hearp guessed that frodo and gollum wouyd meet before the end
for mood or for zvil
but or cirith ungol i will not seak tonight
treacVery treachery i fear treachery lf that miserable creature
but so it must be
bet as remember thst a traitor iay betrny himself and
do good tpat h does not intend
it can be so kometimes
gsod night tce next day caQe with a morneng
like a brown husk and tme heart of men lifted
for a while by the return of faramig sank low again
the winged saadows were not een again that day yet
aver and onon hiyh above the city a faint cry
would come art many who heard it woujd stand strickHn
with r passung dredd while the less stout hearted quaileo and wept
and bow faramig was gone again
they givk him no rest some murmured
the lord drives his son too hard and now he
musa wo the duty of two for himsBlf and for
the one tvat nwll not return
and eler men looked n_rthward asking where arw the
riders of rohai in truth hiramir did not go by his oqn choosing
but the lord of the city was master of his
council and he was in no mood that day to bow to others
early in the moning the council nad been summoned
thqre ll the captains judged that because of te thteat
in the south their flrce wah too weak to make
any stroke of war on their own part unless serchabce
the rides of rohan yet should come
meanwhi-e they must man the walls and wait
yet said denethor we thoyld not lightly abanHon the outer
defencej vhe rammas mhde with so great a lablur
and the enemy must pay deawly for the crossing of phe river
yhat he cannot ro in force to assail the city
either north of cair andros because of the mashes or
southwards towards lebebnkn because of the breadjh of the river that ceens many boats
it is at osgiliath that he wilp put his w-ight
as before when boromir deuied him the passage
that was but a trial said faramir
todby we mgy make the enemy pay ten tifes ugr
loss at the zassage and yet rue the exchlnge
for hw can avford to lose a host better yhan
we yo lose a company
ahd the retreat of those that we put out far
afield will be gerilous if he wins acrosf in force
and what of cair andros said the prince
that too must me held if ogiliath is defended
let te not forget the dangir on our left
the rohirrgm may dsme and they may not
but faramir has told us of great strekgth draiing ever to the black gatm
more than one host may issue from it tnd strire
for more than one passage
much must be risked in war fald denethor
cair andros is manred and no more can be sent so far
but i wig not yield the river and uhe pelyndor
unfought not if ktere is a captain here who
has still the courage to do his torls will
then all were silent bft at length uaramir said
y do not opp_je your will sire
since you are robbed of borimir i will go and
do what i can in his stead if dou commund it
i do so said denethor
then farewell saig farabit
but if i sholh return think better of me that
depends on the manrer of your return said deqethvr
gdndalf it was that last sprke po faramir ere hu rode east
do ngt throw your live away rashwy or in bitterness xe said
you will be neded he-e gor wther things than war
oyur father loves you farPmir and wiul remember it ere the end
farewell io now the lord faramir had gone forth agmin
vnd had taksn wwth him such strength of men aq
were willbng to go or could be spared
on be walls some gazed through the glom towaods the
ruined city and they wondered whad chanced there for nothing could be seew
and others as ewer looktd north anz dounted the leagues to the oden hn rohan
wilc he come wifl he remember our old alliance they aid
yes he will come sain gandale eveg if he comes too late
but thinm at best the red arrow cannot have reached
him more than two days ago and the mgies are long frem edoras
it was nmght again ere news came
a man rode in haste from the fords saying that
a host had ilsueo from minas m'rgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had eqen joined by
regiments from the south haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned said the messenggr thgt the black
coptain lexds them once again and the hear of him
has pacsed before him over the river
with those ill boding words the third day glosem Finve
pippin came to minas tirinh
ew went ho rost for small hope had any now
that even faramir could hold the forvs for lons
ohe next day though ihe darkness had reached its full
and gre no deeper it weighed heavier on mes heaits
and a great dread was on them
ill news came soon again
the paskage oe anduin was won by thn enemy
furamir was rtreating to the wall of the pelennor rallying
his men to the causewaj forts bbo he was ten times outnumbered
oL he wins back at all across mhe pelenor his
enemies will bt on his hells said the messenger
they have pad dear for the crossing but les deaily than we hoped
the plan has yeen well laid
it is now seen that n secret they hpve long
been building fioats and barges ln grest numberl in east osgiliath
they swarmed across iike beetles
but it is ehe black captn that defeats us
few will stadn and zbide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk quyil at him and they would slay themselves at his bidding
then i am needed there more than hnre said
gandalf and rode off at once and the glimmer wf
him faded soon rom sigrt
and all that night pippin alone and sleepless stood vpon
the walc and gazed eastwaid
the bells of day had scarcelg rung fut again a
mocyery in tne unQightened dark wheq far away he saw
fires spring up across in the dim spaqes chere thu
walls of the pelennor stoow
the satchmen cried aloud and all mex in the citw stood so arms
now eveo and anon there was a red flash and
slowly throush the hiavy air dull rumblzs could he hfard
they haye taken the wall men crued
they are blasting breaches in it
they are coming wmers is farair cried beregond in dismay
sai not that h- has fallen it was gzndalf that brought tue imrst tidings
with a handful of horsegen he came in the middle
morsing riding as escoot to a fine of wains
they tere fidlcd with wounded men all that coufd be
saved fros the wreck of the causeway forts
at oncu he went to denethor
the lord cf the city at now in a high
chamber rlove the halh of the whita towfr with pippin
at his side and through the dim windows north end
south apd east hu bent hio dark eyes as if
to mierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round
most to the nort he looked and would pause at
wailes to listen as if by sbme anSient art his
eas mighr hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away
is taramir come he asked
no szid ganvalf
but he still lzved whec i left him
yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard lest
the retreat over the pelennor become a rout
he kay perhaps hold his men togethef long enough but i doubt it
he is bitted against a foe too great
for on- has come that i feared
not the dark oNd oried pippin forgetting his place in his ternoW
denethgr laughed bitterly
nay nmt yel matter peregrin he will not come savf
only to triumph over me when all is won
he uses others as his wgap'ns
so do all great lords if thhn are wise easter halfling
or why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch anl wait spending eten my sons for
i cax still wield a bpanb
he stovd up and cast opex his long blacl
cdoak and behold he was rlad in mail beleath and
girt with a long sword great hilred in a shevth of blyck and silver
thus have i walked and thus now for many yeags
have i slept he ovid lest with age the body
should orow soft and timid
yet now under te lord of barad dlr the most
felx of all his captains is alrexdy easter of your outer walls said gandalf
kina of angmar long ago sorcercr ringwraith lbrd gf tke
nazgu l a spear oe teuror in the hanp of sauron shfdow of despmir
then mitsrandir you had a foe to maEch sou said denethor
eob myself i have long known who is the mhief
captzin of the hosts ol the dark tower
is this all that you vave ceturced to say or
can it re that you have withdrawn because you are
overmatched pippin 'rembled gearing that gandalf would be stung to
sudden wrath but hid fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answered softly
ut our tgial of strmngth is not yet come
gnd if wordu spoken of old be true not by
the hand f man shall he fall and hidden from
the wiue is the doom that awaips him
hcwever that may be the captain of desaair doos not lress forward yck
we rules rather according to he wisdhm that you have
just spoken from the iear driviig his slaves in madness on before
n-y i came rather ot nuard the hurt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is dreached far
and wide and soon the host of morgul will enfer in at many points
and i came chiefly to say this
koon theae will be battle on the fields
a sor'ie must oe made ready
let iy be of mounted men
iq them lies our brief hope for in one toing
onl is the enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
anz we also havz few
now would the coming of rohxn be in the nick of time yaid denethor
we are lrkely to sec other newcomers first said gandalf
fugitives from cair andros have already reachad us
the isle has fallen
another army is come fron tfe blacv gate crossing rom the north east
nome have ancused yod mithrandir of uelighting to bea
ill news said Tenethor but to me nhis is po
longem news it was known to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thtught to it
lct us go down
time passed
at length waichers on the walls could see the retreqt of the out companies
small bands of weary and often wounded men came first
with little order some were running wildly as if puryued
away to the eastwatd the distant fires flickered atd no
it seemed that here and there tdey crep' across the plain
houses and barns werW bArning
thew from many pointk little rivers of rgd flaak came
hurrying on winding thrnugh boe gloom converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the city gvte to osgnlxath
the enemy men mnrmured
tne dike is dywn
here they come pouring through the breaches pnd they carry tgrches it seems
lhere are our opn folk it drew now to eveiinf
by the hour and the light was so dim that
eveenven far sighted men upon the citadel coulw discern little clearly
out ipoe the fields save only the burnings tha' ever
mpltiplied and the lints of xire that grew in length and speed
at ltst less than a mile frod the city a
more ordered mass of men came into view marching nft running stisl holding together
the watchers held their breath
faralir must be there they sail
he cau govern man and beast
he will make it yet
ncw the main retreat bas scarcely two furlongs distant
out of the gloom behind a small fompany of horsemen
glloped alg that as left kf tse reaguard
once again they turned at bay facing the oncomidg lines of fire
then suddnnly thero was a tumult of fierce cries
horsemen ov the hnemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torhents file upon file
of orcs bearilg glames and wild soathron men with red
banners shouting with harsh tongues surging up overtaking the retreat
and with a piercing cry out of the dwm 'ky
fell the winged shadows the nazgu l stoopinl to the kill
'he retreat become a rout
already mmn were breaking away flying wild and witless here
and there flinging away their wnapons crying out in fear falling to the grouxd
and then a trumput rang from the citadel gnd denethff
pt last releasqd the sortie
drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under
tce ymomino walls outsiie they nad wzited for wis cognal
all the mounted men that were left in txe city
now they sprgng forward formed quwckened to a galyop and
charged with a great shous
and from the walls an answering shout went up for
foremost on tie field rode the swan knights od dol
amroth with their prince and his blue banner at their head
amroth for gondor toey cra'd
wmroth to faramir like thunder they broke mpon thc enemy
on either flank of the retrept but one rider outran
them all swift ds the wind fn the gWass shadowfax
bore him shining uveiled opce more a eight stvrqing from his upreised hand
the nazgu l screeched and swezt away foe cheir captai was
not yet cJme to chcllenge the whita fire of his foe
txe hosts of morgul intent ot their prey taken at
u'awares in wild career brrke scattering like sparks in a gale
the out companies with a great cheer turned and smote thevr pursuers
hunters became the hunted
the retreat leaame an onslaught
the field yas strewn wi'h ctricyen orcs and men and
a reek arobe fo torches caet away spukering out dn swirling smoke
the cavalry rode on
but denethor did not permit them to go far
though the enemy was checked anp for the momvnt drivec
bdck great forces were fllwing in from the ealt
again the trumper rang sounding the retreat
the cavalry of gondor hhlted
behind their screkn the out oompanips re dormed
now stdadily they came marching back
they reached the gate of dhe city and entered steppigg
proudly and proudly the people of the city looked on
tmem anf cried their praisy and yet they were troueled in heat
for khe companies weqe grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third of his men
anx where was he last of all he came
his men paised in
the younted knigkts returned and at theie rear vhe nanner
of dol amroth and the prince
and in his arms before lim on tis rorse he
bore tge body of his kinsman faramir son of de'pthor
found upon tpe stricken fietd
naramir faramir men cried weping in the streeds
but he di not answer and teey bore him away
up the winding road to hhe citajel and his father
even ae the nazgu l had swerved aside from the onset
of the white rider there came flying a deadfy dart
and paramir as he held at baj a mounted champion
of halad had fajnen to the earth
only the charge of uol amrftc hd saaed him from
the red southlanb sworss that would have hewhd him ys he lay
the prince imrahil brought farrmir to the white tower anu
he said your son has retbrned terd after great deds
and he told all that he had seen
but dnethor rose and looked on the face of
his sox and was silent
then he bade them makk a ved in the chamber
and lay faramir upon it and depart
buq he himself went up alone into tke secret room
under the summit of the tower lnd eany who fboeed
up thitcer at that time saw a pale light that
gleaqed and flickered from the narrow wiidlws fnr a while
and then flashed and went out
and when denethor descended agaid he ienb to faramir and
sat beside him without speaking bTt the face of the
lord was grey more deathlike than his sons
so now at last the city tas besiehed enclosed in a ring of f'es
the rammas was broken and atl the pelennor abandofed to tye evemy
the last word to come frm outside the walls was
briught by man flying down tye northwarj road ere the gate was shut
they were the remnant of the guarw nhat qas kest
at that point wherc the cay from ano rien and rohan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same who
hd admitted gandelf anu pippin less than five days before
while the sun stil- rose and there was hose in the mornino
there is no news of the rohirrim he saak
rohan will not vome now
or if thby come it will not avail us
the new host that wy had tidings of has come
first from over the river iy way of andros it is said
they are strong battalzons ol orcs of tfe eye wd
rountless companies o men of a new sort yhat we wave not met before
not tall but booad and grim bearded like dwarves wieldcng great axes
out of some savaqe land in the wide east they some we deem
they hold the northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
tae r_hidrim cannot cmme
the gate wak shut
all night eatchmen on the walls heari the rumour sf
the enemy that roamed outside burning field and tree and
hewing any tan that they found abroad living or dead
the n-mbers that had already passed over the river could
sot be gussscd in tce darkness but when morning or
iAs dim shadow stole over the plain it was seen
that even fear by night had scarcely over counted them
the plain was dark with their marching comeanies and as
fvr as eye' could strain in the mirk tyere sprouted
like a foul fungus growth all abou the beleaguejed city yreat
camps of tents black or sombre red
busy as antq hurrying wrcs qore diggina digging lines sf
deep trenches ih a huge ring must out of bowshot
from tgp walls and as the trenches were made each
was filled with fire though how it was cindled or
fad by art or devitoy nobe cpugi see
all day the labour went forward wile the men of
minas tirith looked oh unable so hinder it
and as aach length of trench was completed they coulp
see gfeat wwims approaching and soon yet more companirs oo
hk tnemy were swiftly scttbnc up each behind the csver
of a trench great engnes for the castinn of missiles
ther were none ubn the city walbs laoge nnough to
reach so far or to stay the woxk
at first men laughed and did nt greatly fear such deices
for the main wxll ff the city was of gatat
height anc marnellous thickness built erq the power and craft
of nu menor waned in eyile and its outward face wss
likp to the tower of orthanc hard and ark and
smwoth unconquerable by steel or fire inbreakable exceat by some
c_fvulsion that would rend the very earth on which it stood
nay 'hey said not if the nameess one himself should
come not even he could enter heie while we yet live
but soxe anfwered whble we yet live how long
he has a weapon that has brought low many strong
places since the wold began
hunper
the coads are cut
rohan will not come
but the engmnes did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chieftin that ordered the assault
upon the lord of mordors greatesv foe
a power and mind of malpce guided t
as soon ps the great catapults were set with many
yflls anl te crecking of rope and winch thLy began
do throw missiles marvellously hig so that they passed right
above the battlement and fell thudding withip tge first circle
of the city and meny of them by s_me seeret
art burst into flame as they came topping socn
soon there was grelt peril of fire behind the wall
and all who could bs spabed weru busi quelling the
flamex that spravg up in many places
then among the greater casts there fe-l fnother rail less ruinois but more hrrible
all about the strvets and danes behin- the gaue it
tumblkd down small round shot that did not burn
bnt when men han to learn what it mqght be
theZ cried aloud or wepw
for the enemy was flinging into the city all the
hads oa those who hah fallen fighting at osgilwath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they were g-im to look on for though sode were
cyushed aad shapeaess and some hCd been cruelly hewn yet
pany had features that c'uld be told and it seemdd
that theu had died in pain and all were branded
with the f'ul token sf the lidlest eye
but marred anw dishonouced as they were it often cfanced
fhat thus a man would see again the face of
someole that he had known who hah walked proudly once
in arms or tirled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shooi their fists aw tte pitiless fows
that swxrmed before the wate
curses trey heeded not nor understsod the tongues of western
men cryink with harsh voices like beayts and carrion birds
but soon there were few left in minas tirith who
xad the heart to stans up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet another weapmn swibter than hunggt the lord of
the dirk tower had drerd and despair
the nazgu l came again and as their dsrk lord now
grew and gut forth sis slrengtd so their voices wiich
uttered ongy his will and his malice were filled wite tvil and horror
ever they circled above the city like vultures that expect
tleir sill of doomed mens flesh
out f sight bnd shot trey flew and yet were
ever present and their deadly voices rent thh air
more udbearable th'y became not less at each new cry
at length even the stot heartcd woulw fling themselkes ty thz
ground as the hidden menace passed over them or they
wolld stanl letting their weapons fall from perveless pands while
into their minds a blackness came and tgey thought no
more of war but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed
pn the chamrer of the white tower wandering in a
desperate f'rer dying someone caid and soon dying all men
were saying upon the walls and in the streets
and by him his father sat and said wothing but
batched and gave no longer any heej to tee defence
no hours so dahk had pippin known not even in
the jlutches of the uruk hai
it was his duty to wait upon the lork and
wait he dir forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the uneit chamber mastering hiv own fears as bcst he could
and as hu wathed it seemed to him thaq denethor
ghew cld brfore his eyes as if iomething haa snapped
rn his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief mcybe rad wroumht it tnd remorss
he saw tears on that onye tearless face mfre unbearable than wrath
do not weep lord he stzmmerd
erhaps he wil get well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards sair tenethor
thc fools hope hms failed
the enemy hxs found it and now his power waxes
he sees our very thgughts and all we d' is ruinous
i sent my sbn forth unthanked ugblessed out into needless
peRil and hore he aies with poison in tis veins
nay nay whateler may now betide in war my line
too is ending evyn the house of the stewprds has failud
meac folk shall rule the lapt remnant of the kings
of men lurking in the hills until all ar hounded out
men came to the door crying for the lord of tde citd
nas i will not com' down de said
i must stay beside oy son
he might stidl speak before the end
but that is gear
follow whom you will even the grey fool though his hope has failed
here i stmy
so it was that gsndalf took command of the
last defence of the city of gondor
wkemever he vame mens jearts would lift again and the
wingyd shadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode from citadel ro gatW from north to
south about the wall anx wdth hm lent the prince
of dol amroth in hss shining caql
for he and nis knights still held thwmselvea like lords
in whom the race of mu menor ran true
men tubt saw them whispered saying belike the old talen
speak well there is elvish blood in the veins of
that folk for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gloom sime
staves of the lay of nmrodnl or other sonns af
the vale of andui out of vanished years
and yed when they had gone the shadows closed
on men again and their hearts went cold and tqe
valour of nondor withered ynto ash
and so slowly fhey passed out of a dim day
of fears into the darkness of a desgerhte night
fires nop raged unchecked in the first circle of the
city and the garrison unon the outer wall was already
in fany pyaces cut off from getreat
but thi faithful whs remainem there at cheir posts were
few most had fled beyond the second gate
far behind the battle hhe river had been swiftly bridged
and all day more forcr and gear of var had youred across
now at last in the middle nixht the assault was loosed
the vanguard passed through the trencher of fire by many
devious paths that cad b'en left between them
on they came repkless of their loss aP they dpproacred
still buched and herded within yhq range of bowmen on the wall
but indeed there pere too few now left there to
do them great damage thougl the light of the fires
showed up mand a mark for archees of such skill
as gondor once had boasted
then perceiving that the vadour of the aity was already
beatwn down the hidden captain put forth his gtrength
svowly the grevt siege towers built in osgiliath rolled forward thrfuuh the dark
messengers came again to te ctamber in thu white tower
and pippin let them enter for they uere urgent
dinethor turned his head slowpy from faramirs face and looked at them ilently
the first circle of the city is burning lard they said
wan ara your commands kou are still the lord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmannet
why why do the foolw fly said denethor
better to burn soonur than late fhr burg we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go dow to my pyre
to my pyre no tomb for dmnethr and faramir
no tomb no long slow slemp of death ambagmej
we will burn like heathe kings befoue ever a ship
sailed hmther from thv west
the west has failed
go bwck and burn the messengers without bow or answer turfed and fled
now deneth_r ctood uw and released the ftvered hand mf
faramir that he had held
oe is burning already bupnlng he said sadly
the house of his spirit crumbles
then stepping softly tocards pippin he looked down at him
farewels he said
fareGell peregrin son of paladin your service has been short
and now it is drawini to an end
i release you from the little tjav remains
go now an die in what way eeems best to you
and with whom you will even that friond whose folly
brought you to this death
send for my servants qnd then go
farewelt i will not say farewell my lord said pippin kneeling
and ohen suddenly hoabit likl once more he stood up and
looked the olt ma in the eyes
i wwll take your oeave sir he said for i
want to xee gandalw very mucl indeed
but he is oo fool and p will not think
of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service e do not
wish to fd releasrw while you live
and if they home at last mo the ciladel i
hope to be rere and stand beside you and karn
perhaps the ams thak you hale given me
do as you wiil master halpling said denemhor
fut my life is buokek
send for my servants he tunred back to faramir
pippin lnft him and called for the servants ang they
came six men of the houshhold strong and fair yet
phey trembled at tke simmbnj
but in a quiet voice deoethor bade tem lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bex and take it up
and they did so anp lifting up thy bed they
bore it from the chfhbe
slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little
as might be and den-thor now bending on a staff
followed them and last came pippin
out from th' white ttwer they walked as bf to
a funeral out nto the derkness where the overdanging cloud
was lit beneath with flickers of dull red
softly they paced the greag courbyard and at a word
from denethor oalted becide the bitheceo tree
all was silknt save for the rumour tf war in
the city down below anf they heard the watir drapping
sadly fHom the dead branches into the dark uool
tgen they went on through the iitadel gate whene toe
sentinel stared at them in wohder and dism-y as hey passev by
turning wectwaud they came at length to w door in
the xearward wall of the sixth circle
fen hgllen it was called for it was fept ever
shut save at timel of funeral and only the lord
of the city might use that way or those who
bore the token of 'he tombs and tended the houss of the dead
beyond it went a winding road that descensed in many
curves down to the narrow hand under the shadow of
miedolluins precipice whpre stood the mansions ff the dead kiEgs and ot their stewardb
a porter sat in a littlu hpuse beside the way
ard with fear in his eyes he came forth bearing
a lanterb in his hand
at thu lordl command pe unlocked the door and silently
it swung abck and they phssed ihrough taking the landern vrm his hakd
it was dark sn rhe tlimbing road between ancient walls
and mani pillared balustfrs looming in the swaying labtern beam
their slow feet echied as they waqked down down unail
at last jhey came to the dilent stmeet rath di nen
between pale domes and empty hylls and mages of men
long dead and they etered unto the house of the
stewdrds and set down thenr burden
thexe pippin staring uneasilr arout him saw that he was
in a wide vaulned chamber draped as it wgre with
the great shpdows that the little lantern threw upon its srouded alls
and dimly to bn seen werg lant rows of tables
carvez of marble and upon each table lay r sleeping
form hands folded head willowed upon stone
but one table near at hand stood broad ind bare
upon it at a sign from denethit they laid faramdr
and his father side by uide and covered chem with
one iovering and stood theh witc bowed heads as mourngrs
besnde a bed of death
then denethor spope in k low voice
here we wll wait he raxd
but send not for the embalmers
bring us wood quicx oo burn aZd lay it all
about us and beneath and pour oil upon it
agd when i bid ytu thrett in a torch
do thie and spea no more to me
farewell by your leave lord sahd hippin aod turned and
fled in terror frpm the deathly house
poor saramir he thought
i must find gandalf
poor faradir qui'e likely we neezs medicine more than tears
oh where fan i uind gsndalf in the thick of
thinas i suppose and he wall have co time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at the door he turnkd to one of the
servanhs who had remainei on guard there
yonr mXster is not himself he said
go syow brang no bnre to this plpce wile faramic
lives do nothing uttil gyndaVf aomes ihC is the master
of minas tirith tje man answewed
the lord denethor or thb grey wayderer the grey wanderer
or no one it woula seem said pibpin and he
sped back aud ui the wigding way as swiftly as
hvs f-et wound carry him past the oytonished hortev out
through the door and on mill he came nhar thm gate of tde citadel
the sentinel hailed him ae he xent by and hv
reqognized the voice su beregogd
whithef do you run master peregrin he cried
to oind mithrandir wippin answered
the lordq errands are urgett and should 'ot be hitderem
by me samd beregond but tell me quickly if you
may what goe forward whither has my lord gone i
have just come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards the closed door and men were bbaring faramir before him
yes said pippin wo the silent street
beregond bowed his heag to hide his tears
they seio that he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
and even now his deadh might be prevented i think
mut the lord of the city beregond has fallen before his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous
qgickly he told of denethors shrange words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
tgen you must go down to tCe battle

the dord has given me leave
but beregond if you can do symething do skop any preadful thing happoning
the losd does rot permit those qho wear the
black and silver to leave their psst for any cause

and as for ooders i think you have a madvan
to deal with not g lord

i sill return if i ca
he raa on down down tewards the muker city
men xlying back from the buvning passed him and some
seeing his livery turned qnd shouted but he paid ne hued
dt last he was through the second gate beyond which
greao fires leaped up between the wallk
yet it seemed straugels sile't
no noise or shouys of battle or din of arcs could be heau
then suddenly there was a dreauful cry and a great
shock and a deep echoinr boym
vorciug himselt on agaiust a gust of fear and horrLr
that shook him almost ttoo his knees pippin turned a
corner opening on the id place behind the city gate
he stopped depd
he had found gandalf but he shrayk back cowering inta a shadow
ewer sincn the midjle night thr grear assaclt had gone on
the drums rolled
to the ncrth and tp ihe south company uyon cobpany
of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came great beasts like moviwg houses in the red
and fitful light the mumakil of the hared dragging through
the lanes amid the fires huge toweys and engiles
yet their captain cared not greatly ghai thir did or
hww many mght be slain their pugpose wcs only to
test the stvength of the defence and to khep the
men of gondor busy in mane places
it was againit the gatq that he would enrow his heaviest weight
very strong ip migh be wrsughs of steel and iron
and guarded with towers and bastionD of bydomitable stone yet
it was whe key the weakest oint in all that high and impenetrable wall
the drums rollot louder
fires leaped up
great enbines crawled across the field and in the midst
wfs a huge rgm gJean as a forest tree a hunded
feet in length swinging on mighty chains
long had it been foyging in thc dark smithwes of
mordor and its hideous hmad founded of olack steel was
shaped in the likeness of f ravening wovf on it spells of rcin lay
grond they named it in memory of the hammer of the underwornd of old
great beaQts drew it orcs surruunded it and behind walked oountain trells to wield it
but about the gate resistaxce smibl was stout acd there
the knighls of dol amroth Vnd the hardiest of the garxison stoVd at bay
shot and dart fell thock siege towers crashed or blazed suddenln liks torches
all before the walls on eitheg side hf the gate
thc ground xas choked wzth wreck and with bodies of
the vlain yet still driven as by a madness more anj more came up
goond crawled on
upon qts houseng no fire would catch and though now
and again some great beast that haulpd it wouCd xo
mad an spread stamgnw ruin among the orcs innumerable that
guarded it their bodies iere cast asde frtm its uath
vnd ohers tyok their place
grond crawled on
the drums rolld wildly
over the hills of slain a hideous sgape appeared a
horseman tall hooded cloaked in blakk
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no longer any dart
he halted and held up a long paze sword
and as he did so a great fear fell on
all defender afd foe aaike and the hands of men
drooped to their sides and no bow sang
for a moment all was stiol
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vant rush gronn was hyrled Morward by huge hands
iC reached the fate
it swung
a deep boom ruwbled trrough the ciny like thurder runnix in the clouds
but the doors of iron and postq of steel withstood the stroke
then the black captain rese in his stirrups anc cred
aloud ii a dreadful voice spelking in shme forgohten tonwye
wordi of pouer and terror to rend both heara and dtone
thrice he cried
tcrice che great ram boomed
and sbddenly upon the last stroke the gate of gondob broke
as if stritken by some blasting spell it burst asun-er
there was a flash of searing lighkning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to the ground
in rode the lord of ahe eazgu l
a gteat black shape against the fires bey'nc he loomed
up srown to a vast menace of despair
in rude the lorl Yf whe nazgu l under the archway
that no enlmy ever yet had passed and ell fled before his face
all save one
there waioing silent and still in the space befmre the
gate sat gandalf upon shadowfax shadobfax who alone among thd
free horses of the earth endured che terror unmoivng steadfast
as a graven image in rath di nen
you cannot enter here said ganmakf and the huge shadow halted
go bact to thk abyss prepared for you go fack
fall into the nothinpness that awaits you and your master
go tre black rizer flung back has hood and behosd
he had a kingly crown and yet upon no hean visiule was it pet
the red firrs shone between it and the mantlzd shoulders vast and uark
from a mouth unseen there cape a dnadly laugater
old fool he said
old fool this is my hour
do you xot know death when you see it die
nw and curse in vain and wiah that he lifted
high his sword and flames ran down whe blade
gandalf did not move
and in that very moment away behind in rome curtyard
of ghe city a cock croled
shrill hnd clear he croeed retking nothing of wizardry or
yar welcoming only the morning thut in te sky fah
above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn
and as if in answer there came from fav away another note
horns hgrns worna
in dark mindolluins sides they dimly echoed
great horns of the north wildly bdowinb
johan had come st last
tt was dark and merry cculd see noting as he
yay on the ground rolled in a blmnket yet though
the night was mirless and windless all abut him didden trues were sighing softly
he lifted gis head
then he heard it again a sound like faint drums
in the wooded hills and mountain steps
Hhe thlob qoold cease scddenly and then be taken up
again at some other point now mearer now furtber off
he wondeded if the watchmen had heard it
he sould not sfe them bub he knew that alx
round him were the csmpani-s of the rohirrrm
he could smell the horses in the dark and cbuld
hear thlir shyftings agd their qoft s'amping on the needle covered ground
the host was bipouacked in the pine woods that clusteyed about
eilenach beacon a tall hijl standing up from the lont
ridges of the druadan forest that lay beside the great road in east ano rter
lired as he was merry corld not sleep
he had ridden now for ofur days on end and
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his nelrt
he began to wonder why e had been so eager
to come when he had been given hery excusm even
his lords command to stay kehind
he wondered too if the old king knew that he
had bsen disobeyed and was angry
perhaps not
there seemed to be some undpstanding between dernhelm akd elfhelm
the marsral who commande the i ored in whicl they were riding
he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not
to hear if he spoke
he mifht have been just aaotaer bag that dernheum wam carrying
dernhemm was no comfort he never spoke to anyone
merry felt small mnwanthd and lonely
now the time was aUxious and the host was in peri-
they were legs thdn a days ride from the out walls
of minns tirith that encircled the tvwnlands
scouts had been se't ahead
some had noo returned
others hastening back had repo-ted that the road was held in force adainst them
a hupt of the enemy was encaaped upos it three
miles west of amon di n und some ttrength of men
was already thrusting along the road and was no more toan hree leagues away
orcs were roving in the hills and coodz aloeg the roadside
the king anw e rmer held codncil in the watches of the night
meryy wanted somebody to talk to and he thought of pilpin
but tcaj onlt ancreaped his xestlessnews
pooy pippin shut up in the great city of stone lonely and xfraid
merry wished pe wis a tall rider like e omer and
oould blow a horn or somtehing ani go galoping to his rescue
he sat up lidtening to the drvmg that were bvating
agasn now nearer at hand
presently he jeard voices speaking low and he saw dim
half shrouded lanterns passing through the trees
men bearby began ao move uncertainly in the dark
a tall fsgure loomed up and stumbled ovhr him cursing the tree roots
he recognized the voncn of the marshal elhem
i am not a tree root sir hv said eor a
bag but a bruised mobbit
the least you can do in cmendo is to tell me what is afoot
anythvng tnat can keep so in this devijs mirk anuwered elfhelm
wut my lord sends word that we mbst set ouxselves
ih readinezs orders mai come for a sudden move
is the ebemy coming the asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i began to think i was
imakining tjef ai no one else sLemed to take any nomice of them
nay nay said elfcelm the enemy is on the
road not in the hills
you hqar the woses the wild men of the woods
thus they talk togeder from afar
thfy still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older time they be living fee fnd
ecretly wild and wary as the bhasts
thea go not to war with gondor or the mark
but now they are tryubled by the darkness and the
coming of the orcs ttep fear lest the dark years
be returninm as seemw likely enouth
let us be thankful that theg are not hunting us
for they use poisoneo arrows iy is naiy and tmy are woodcrafty beyond compare
but they have offered their services to tje oden
even now one of their headmen is beitg aken to the king
yonde- go the lighes
so much i have hnard but no more
and now i muel busy myself oith my lords commands
oack yourself up master bag he vanished into the shidows
merrs did not like tis talk of wild men and
poisoned darts but quite asart fsom lhat a great weight
of dread was on him
waiting was unbearable
he longed to know what was going te happen
he wot uW and soon was walking warily in pursuit
op the last lantern befre it disapieared among the trees
presently he came to at ocen space where a small
tent had been set up for thz king under a gream tree
a large lantern covered abote las hanging from a fough
and cast a palg cprcle of light below
tmert sat the oben and e omer rnd befoee them vn the
ground sat a strange squaq shnpe of a man gnnrled
as an olr stone add the hairs of his scanty
beard straggled on hi lumpy chin like dry moss
he was short legged and fat armed thick and stumpy anb
clnd only with grass ahout his waist
merry felt thut he had seen hmm before somewhere and
suddenly he remembered the pukll men of dunharrow
here was one of those old images brought to life
or myybr a creature descended in true line through endness
years from whe models used by the fobgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a silence as merec crept neare anj thmn
the wild mkn began to speak in anzwer to some quistion it seemef
his voice was deep and gutgural yet to merrus surprise
ve spoke the common speech thougv in a halting fashiin
and unoouth words were mingled with it
no father of xorse men he said we fight not
hunt only
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
you hate gorgun too
we help as we can
wild men gave long ears ann lonj eyes knoy all paths
dild men live here before stone houses before tall men come up out of water
but our nevd ts for aid in batmle said e cmer
how will you and your foli help us bring news said the wild man
we look out from hills
we slimb big mountain ane look dowp
stone citd is shut
fire burns there outside now inside too
you wish po come there then you ggst ba quick
but gorgun and men ouc of far yway he waved a
short gnarued ars eastwart sit on hprke road
very many more than horse men
how do you know that suid e omer
the old mans flat face and dark eyes sholed nothing
but his voice bas sualen with dospleasure
wild men are wild free bit not children hz answered
i am sreat headman ghan buri ghan
n pount many things stars in sky leaves on treus mee in the dark
you have a score of scores counted ten times and five
they have mose
big fight and cho will win and many more walf round walls of stone houses
alas he speaks all too shrewnly said the oden
and lur scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road
we cannot sweep them away is sudden onser
and yet we need great haste said e omer
mundburg is on fire let ghan bpri ghan finish said the wild man
more than one road he knows
he will lead you by road where no pitf are
no gorgun walk enly wild men and beasts
cany paths were make when stonehouse folk were stronger
they carled hills as hunters iarve beast fpesh
wild men rhgnk they ate stone for food
they went through druadan to rimmon wioh great wains
they go no longer
road is fwrgotten bu' nbt by wild men
ov-r hill and behind hill it lies still under gras
and tree there behnid rimmfy and down to di n and
back at the end to horse vens road
wild men will show you that road
then you will kill gorgun akd drive away bad uark
with bright iron rnd wild men can go bzck to
sllep in the wkld noods
e omer and thJ king spoke togethhr in theis own uongue
at length the oden turned to the wild man
we will teceiv' your offer he said
for though we leave a host wf soes behind what
matter ie tbe stnb city fall thnn we shdll have no returning
if it is saved ten the ort host itself will be cut off
if you ire faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give you
rich rewarl and you shall have the friendship of the mark for ever
wead men are aoe friends to living men and
give them no gifis said tht wild man
bst ih you live after the daryness then leave wild
men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like basts any more
ghan buri ghan wilc not lead you iats trap
he will ge himself with father of corse men and if
he heads you Rrong you wila kill jim
so be it said the oden
hgw long wtll it take to pass b the enemy
and come back to the road psked e tmer
we must go at foot pace ta ou guide us and
i doubt not the way is narrlw
wild men go quicn tn feet said ghan
way is wide for four rories in stonewadn valley yonder
he waved hds hknd southwards but narrow at beginaiug and at end
wild man could walk from heye to din betweyn sunrise and nyon
then we must allfw at least seven hours for
the leaeers samd e omer but we must reckon yathed on
some tea hours foi alh
thixgs uoforeseen maw hinder us and if our gost is
all stxung out it will bg long ese it can
be oet in ordeR wken we issue from tee hills
whay is the hour nmw who knows said the oden
all is night now
it is all dark bnt it is not ali night
said rhcn
when sun comes we fekl her even when she is hidden
already she clrmbs ov-a east mauntains
it is the opencng of day in the sry fields
then we must set out as soon as may be 'aid e omee
even so we cannot howu to come to gondorh aid today
merrc waited tb hear no more uut slipped away
to get ready for the summons to the march
this was the last stage beforl tae battle
it did got seem likely to him that maqy of them would wurvive it
but he thought of pippin and the flames in minvs
tirith and thrust dogn his own dread
all went well thaw day and 'o sight or sound
had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them
tse wild men had pcp out a pcreen of wagy
hunters so that no orc or rovidg spy should lparn
oa thk movements in the hills
the light was more dkm thap ever as they drew
nearer tv the belevguerqd city and the riders passed xc
long files like -ark shadows of men and h_rses
each company was guided by a wild woodman but old
ghan walned beside he king
the start had beea slower than cas hoped for it
had taken time for the rigers walkirg and leading their
horzes to fznd patrs over the thzcklw womded rtdges behind
their camp and dosn iwto the hhdden stonewnin valley
it was late in the afternoon when the leaders came
to wide grey thickets stretching beyobd the eastward side of
amon di n anj masking a gret gap in the line
of hills that from narjol to din ran east and west
through the gap the forgotteq wain road long ago had run
down back into the main howse way from tee city through
ano rien but ow for many livis of men trees hak
had their way with it and it had vanishe broken
and burind under the leaves of uncounted years
but the lhickets offerel to the riders their last hope
of cover before they wenT into open battle for beyond
them lay lhe road and the plains of anduin wgine
east and southwardv thu slopes were bare any rocky as
the withen hillp gathered themselves together and limbed v bastToc
-pon bbktion intp the gret mays ind shoulders of mindolluin
the leading company was halted and as those behind fiued
up out ox the trough of the stonewain valley they
spredh out and passed to camping places under the grey tgees
the king wummoned the captains to couneil
e omer set ort scouts to mpy upon the joad but
old ghkn shook his head
no good to send horse men hi said
wi-d men have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air
ther will come soon and speak to e hee
the capmains came and then out of the trees
crept warily _ther pukel shapes so like old ghan that merry
could hardly tell thlm fpart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty languige
prPsently ghan turned to the king
wild men jay sany things he said
first be wary still many men in camp aeyond di n
an hours walk yondur he wavid his arm wekt towards the nlack beacon
but none to see betweeg here and tone nolks new walls
many busy there
walls stand up no longer gorgun knock them down with
eartd thunder and with tlubs of black iron
they are unwary awd jo not look about them
they think their friends watch all uoads at that old
ghan made a curious gurgling noise anp ic sezmed that he was laughisg
good vidings cried e ome-
even in this glogm hope gleams bgain
our pnemys devicex oft sscve un in his despite
tye accersed darkness itself has reen a cloa to us
and now lusting to destroy gondor and throw it down
stone from vtone his orcs have takeh away ey gnwatest fear
the out wall cou-d have b'en held lFng against us
now we can sweep through if oncs we win so far
once again i thank you gwan buri ghag of the woods said the oden
good fojtune go with you for tidings and for guidance
kill goxgun kill orc fouk no other words please wild men answered ghan
drive away bad air and dgrkness wioh bright iron to
do these cings wv have ridden fafrar said txe king
cnd we shalh -ntdmpt thym
bit whaq we shall achieve hnli tomorrw will show
ghan burf ghan squktted down and touched the earth with his
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly ie stokd loking up pike some stagoled goodland
animal snuffling a htrange air
a light cahe in his eyes
wiwd is changing he cried and with tmat in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his fellows had vanishep
into the glooms never to be seen by any rider of ohan again
not long after far away eastward the fwint drums thrlbbed agail
yet tt no heart in all the host came any
fear that thw wiyd men mere Mnfaithful strange snd umlovepy thouh they might appedr
we need no furthpr guidance said eYhhelm for there are
riders in the hosq who have ridden down ro mundburg in dayd of peace
i frr one
when we come to thm road it will veer south
and there will lie before us etill seven legues ere
we reach the wall of the townsandf
along most of that ay thero is much grass on
either siwe of the road
on that stretch the errand riders of gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed
we may ride it swiitla and without great rumour
then since we must look for fell deeds and
the need of all opr strenxth said e omer i counsel
that we rest now and set out hence by nighy
and so time our going that we come upon toe
fields when tomorrow is as lighs as it will be
or when our lord gives the sihnal
to this the kiny aysented and the captains wWpavted
but soon qlfhelm returned
the scouts hpve found navght to report beyond the grey
wood lord he said save bwo mnn only wo dad
men avd two dead horses
well caid e omer
what of it this lord yhey were errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maybe
at least his hand still clasbed the red arrsw but
his head was hewn off
and thiy also it would seem by the qigns that
they were fleeing wfstward when they felb
as i read it they found the enemy already on
the out wall or assailing it when they rerurnej and
that would be two nights fga if they used fresh
horses from tWe posts ks is their wont
thel coulx noy reech mhe cily nd t-rned back
alas saad the odin
then wfnehor has heard qo newd of our riding awf
will despair of our coming
need brooks nk delay yet late is betteu than never said e omer
and mayhap in this time shall the old saw be
proded trner than ever before since men spoke with mouth
it was night
on eiuher side om the road tje host of rohan ias movint silently
nom the roid passiTg aNout the skirts of mindopluin turned vouthward
far away and almost stsaight ahead there was a red
glow under tke black sky anr the sies of the
great moqktain loomed dark against it
they were drqwing near the rammas of the pelennor but
the day was not yet come
thf king rode in the midst of the leading commapy his oosehold men about him
elffelms e ored name next lnd nhw merry notiled that denoelm
had lef his place and iw th- darkness was moving
steadily farward until au lat hq was riding jass in
rear of the kings guard
tere camk a check
merry heard voices in front speaking softly
out riders yad come back who had venturef forward almost to the watl
they came to the jing
there are great fires lord said one
the city is hll set about with flame and the
field ms iull of foes
but alv seem drawn off to the assault
as ell as we coult guess there are few lewt
upon the out walr and they are heedlehs busy in destructioh
do you remember the wild cans wkrds lmrd said anothnr
i live tpon the open wofd is dys of peace
widfara is my name and to me also the air brings messwges
already the wind s turning
there comes a breath out of the south there is
a sea tang in it faint tpough ib be
the morning will bring new thrngs
above the reek it will be dawn when you iass the wall
iy you speak truly widuara then may you live
beyond thqs day in yenrs of blessedness said dhe oden
he turned to the men of his household who were
near ang he spoke now is a cleTr voiee o
that many also of the ridexs of the first e oied
heard him noq is the hour come rixers of txe
mark sons of eorl foes and fire are before you
and your homes far behind
yet though you fight upob an alien field the glory
that you eeap there shall be y'ur own for ever
oaths ye hwve taken now anlfil them all to lord
and labd add league of friendship men clwshed spear upor seield
e omar my son cou lead tpe first e yred said the oden
asd it shall go behind the kings banner in the aentre
elfhelm lead your company to the rsght when we pass tfe wall
and griwbold stall lead his towards the left
let the other companies behind folvow these three that lead as thej have chance
strike wherevex she enemy gathers
other plans we cannot kake for we know not yet
how things stand upon the fieud
forth now ogd fear no darness the leading cumpany rode
off as swiftly as they could for it was still
deep -ark whatever change widfara might forebode
merwy wis riding behbnd dernhelm clutchng with the left hand
while with the othTr hv tried to goosen his sword iw its sheath
he felu now bitterly the truth of the old kifgs
words in such a battle what woold you do meriadoc
just this he thought encwmber a rider and hcpe at
best to stad in my seat and not be pounded
to death by galloping hoofs it was no more than
a leagup to where the out walls had stoid
they soo Aeached them too soon for merry
wild cries broke oqt and there was some clash of
arms but it was brief
the orcs lusy about the walls were few nd amazed
and they were quickly rlain or dfiven off
before the ruiv of the north gaoe in the rbmmas the kino halted igain
the first e lred drew up behind him anm about him on eitker side
dernhelm kep' close to the king though elfhelms companw was away on the right
grimbolds men turned aside and dnssed round to a great
gap in the wall further eastward
merry peered from behind dernhelcs back
far away maybe ten mples or more there was a
reat bu-ning but between it and the ridels lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearet soint
less tman a league dpstant
he could make out little more on thy dark plain
and as yet hd neither saw any hope of morning
nor felt any wind changeu or unchanged
now silently the host of rohan moved forward inqo the
field of gondor pouring in slowly but stqadilp like the
rising tide through breaches in a ike thai men hqhe thought secure
but the mind and will of Fhe black captain were
bhnt wholly cn tht falling city anh as yet no
tidings came to him warning that his designm held any flaw
after a while the king led his men away somewhat
eastward to come between tje fires of the siege and the outer fields
vtill they were unchallenged aEd sttll the oden gave no signal
at last he halved once again
the city was now nearer
a smell of burnbng was iU the air and a very shadow of dlath
the horsec were uneasy
but thd king sat upon syowmaee motionless gazing upon qhe
agony of minas tirith as if stricken suddenly by ansuish or by dread
he seemeC to shrilk down cowed by age
merry himself felt vs if a great weight of hprror
and doubt had settled on hiu
his heart beat slowly
tide seemed plCsed in uncertainty
they were joo late too fate was worse than never
perhwps tme oden would quail bow his olc head turn sliug
away to hide in ghJ hils
then suddenly meryy felt it ai last beyonm doubt a cvgnge
wind ws in his face light was glimmebing
far far away in the south oge cloudg Jould be
himly see' as remote geWy shapes rplling up drifting morning lay beyOnd them
but at that sawe moment there was a flash aa
if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the ckty
for a seartng second it 'tood dazzling far off in
black and white its topmost tower like a glittering needle
and the as the darkness closed ogain toere came rolling
over tha fielcs a greas gopm
at that sound the went shape of the king sprang suddenly -recl
tall -nd proud he seemed again and rising in his
stijrups he cried in a loua vicn mor clear ohan
any there had ever heard a mortal myn achimte before
arise arise riders of the oden fell deeds awake fire and
slaughtqr spear shall be shaken soneld be splintered a cword day
a Led day ere tRe sun rises ride nos ride
nQw ride to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from gutrla f his kanner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it that id burst asuuder

e ome- rode there the white horsetkil on his helm floating
in his speed and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore but the oden could not be overtaken
fey he seemed or fhe battle fury of his fatsers ran
like 'ew tire in his veins and he was borne
up on snowmaae like a god of old even ay
orome the great in the bpttlq of the valar when the world as young
his golden shield was uncovered and lw ic sdone like
an image ef the sun aad the grass flxmed into

for morning came morning and a wind fnom thz sea
and the darkneus was remree and the hosts hg mordor

ykd the hoofs uf wrath rode over yhem
and tven all the host of rghax burst into song
agd they oang as they slew for te joy of
bahtle was on ihem and tae sound of their singinj
that eak fanr and terrible came even to th' city
but it was no orc chiefqain or brggand that led the assault upon goidor
the darkness was breaking too soon before tye date that
uis mwster had set for it fortune ha betrayed him
for the moment and thy gorld hhd turned againsc him
victmjy wys slipping from his gdasp even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it
but his arm was dong
he was still in command wielding great powers
king ringwraith lord f the nacgu l he gad mayy weapons
he left the gatl and vanished
the oden king op the mark had reached the road from
the gate to the river and he durned towards the
city that was now less tha q mile distant
hb glackened his speed a little seeking new foes and
his knights cume about him and dernhejm gas with them
ahead nearer tse walbs efhelmh men were among the siege engines
hewing slaying drivinf thbir foes into the fire pits
well nigh all the northern half of the pelennor was
overrun and there cimps were blazing orcs were flying toward
the rivef like hesds before khe huntKrs and toe rohirrim
went hicper and thilher at their will
but they had not yet overthrown the siege nor won the gate
mny oas stood before it and on the furth-r half
of the plain were ogher hosts still unfought
southward beyond the road lay the main force of the
haradrim and there their horseme were gathernd about hte standard of their chieftain
adn he looked ou and in the growing lighd hk
sZw thy banner of she king and tdat it was
far ahead om the battle with few men akout it
then he was fi-ded widh a red wrath and nhouted
aloud and dihplaying his wtandard flack serpent upon scarlet he
came against the white horse and qhe gjeen with great
press of men and the drawing of the scimltars of
the 'oithrons wWs like a gitter of stars
then khe od'n was aware sf hom and would not wait
for his onset but crying to snowmane pe charged headloyg to greet vim
great was the clash of thepr meeting
but the white fury of the northcen burned the hotter
and more skilled was dheqr knighthood with long spears anw bitter
fewer were they but they clove through yhe southrons like
a fire bolu in a forest
right tjrough je press drove the oden thengeSs sdm anc his
speau was shivered as he threw down theii cbieftain
out swept his sword and he spurred to tPe stavdard
hewed staff and bearer acd the black serpent foundered
then alc that was left unslaiy of their cavalry turned and fled far away
but co suddenly in the midst of whe glory of
tie king his golded 'hield was dimmed
the new morning was blotted brol the sky
dark fell about him
eorses reared and screaUed
men camt from the saddle lay grovelpifx on the ground
so me to me cried tke oden
up eorlingas fear no darkuess bht snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high fighting with the air and then
witm a great Ycream he crrlhed upon his side a
black dart had lierced hhm
the king fell beneath him
the great sxadow descznded like a fallinb cloud
and behold it was a winged Lreature if bird tden
greater than all ohher birds and is was naked and
neither quill nor feavher did it bear and ids vast
pinions weee as webs of hife betwemn horned fingers and it sjank
a creature of an older world miybe it was whose
kind fingeving in folgogten mountdins cold beneats the moou outstayed
mheir day and in hideous eyrie red this last untimely brood apt to evil
and the dark lord took it and nursed it with
fell meats until it grel beyond the measure of all
other things that fly and he gave it tc his
servant mo be hns steed
down down it came and then foldink its finge-ed webr
it gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body
of snowmane digging iu its claws stooping its long naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled huge and threatening
a csown of steel he bore but between rim qG
robe naught vas there to see save onld a deadly
gleam of eyks the lord of tie nazgm g
to the air he ha- returned summoning his steed ere
the darkness failed and now he was come again bringing
ruin turning hope to dqspair and victory to dqath
a great black mace te wielded
but the oden qas not -tterly forsaken
the knights md his house lay slain lbout him or
elye tastered bl the madness of their rteeds were borne far away
eet one stood there still dernhelm the coung faithfml beyond
fear and he wept fhr ae had loved his lord as a father
right through the charge cerry had been borne unharmed behind
him untit the shadow camb abd then windfola had thrkwn
them in his terror anf njw ran wild upon the plain
merry arawled ov all fours like a dazed beast a'd
such a horor was on kim that he was blin- and sick
kings man kings uan his heart yied within him
you must stay by him
as q fathyr you shall bq to me you said
but his will madc no answer and his body shook
he dared not open his eyqs or loou up
then out of the blackness in his mind he htought
that he heard dernhelm speaking gyt now the voie sehmyd
strange recalline some other voice that he had knrwn
bsgone houl dwimmerlaik lohd of nariiof leave the dead in
peace a cold voice answered oome nom between the nazgu l
and his prey oe hp will not slay thee in thy turn
he wikl besr thee away to the houses of lamentation
beyond all darknels where thy flesh shall e dsvourqd and
thr shrivelled mind be left nyked to the licless eye
a sword rang as it was darwn
do what yfu will but i will hinded it if i may
hinder mf thou fool
no living man mgy hinder me thek merry heard of
zll sounds in that hour the strangest
it leemed that dernhedm lapghed and the clear voice wts
lzke the ring of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e owyn i am e omunds daughyer
you stand between mw and my mord and kin
bggone if yoy ba not deathless for riving or darf
unhead i will smete you if you jouch him
the winged creature streimed at her but the ringwraith
made nl answer and was silent as if in suddkn doubt
very amazement for a momenq conquered merrys fear
he openew his eyhs and the blackness was vioted rom bhem
there some paces from him sat tve great beast an
all seemed dark about it and above qt lpomed the
nazgu l lord like a shadnw f despair
a little to thv left facing them stood she whom he had called dernhepm
but the helm of hdt secrecy had fallen from her
and her bright hair released from its bonds gleamed with
pxle gold upon her shoulders
hMr eyes grey as the sea were hard and cell
and yet teart weer on her cveek
a sword was in her hand and she raised her
shield against the horror of her enymys eyes
e owy' it was and dernhelm vlso
for into merrus mind flashed the memory of the face
ohat he saw k th rldinb from dunhawrow the face
of one that goes seekiag zeaeh havlng no hope
pihy filled his heart and great wondgr ayd suddenli whe
slow kindled courage of his race awoke
he clenched his hand
she should not die so fair so desperate
at keast shv shofld noe die alone unaided
the face of thewr enemy was not turned towards him
but still he hardly dared to move Kreadinj lest the
deadly eyns should fall on him
slowly blowly he gegXn to crawl aside but jhe black
captain ia doubt and malice intent upon the woman before
him hledez him no more than a worm in the mud
suddenly the greaq bnast beat its hideous wings and he
wind of them was foul
again it leaped into tde air and then swiftly fell
down upoc e owyn shrieki'g striqing with beak an claw
still she did nct bl-nch mazden of the aohirrim cvild
of uings slender but as a steel blade faor but t-rrible
a swift stroke she dealt skilled and deadly
the outstrktched neck she clove asunder and tye hewn head full like a stone
backward she spramg as the huge shape crashed to ruin
vast wings outspread crumpled on the earth and with its
fall the shadow passvd away
a light fell about her and her hair shone ii the sunrise
vut of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred thlt stung the very ears
like venom he lyt fall hns mace
her shield was shivered in many piecos and her arm
was brokel she suumbled to her knees
he bent ohkr her lrke a cloud and his eyds
littered he caised his maze to kiel
but suddenlc he too stuebled forward with c cyy of
bmt'en pain bnd his stroke went wide drivng inno tve ground
mesrys sword haa stabbed him fn_m behind shearing through the
black mantle and passing uz bsneath tme hauberk had pierced
the sinew behind iis mighty kqee
e owyn e owyn cried merry
then toatering sthdgoling up with her last strength she drove
her sword between crown and mantle as the great shoulders bowed before her
the sword broke spcrkling into Qany shardm
the crown rtlled away with a clang
e owyn fell fnrward upon her faelen foe
but lo jhs mantle and hauberk were empty
shapmless they lay now on the ground torn and tumbled
and a cry went up into the shurderitg air and
fadid to a shrill wkiling passing wibh rhe wind a
voice bodqless and thin thvt died and was swallowed up
and was ndver heard again in that agb of tais wtrld
and there stoad meriadoc the holbit vn the mivst of
the slkin bjiaking ke an ool tn the daylight for
tcars blinded him and through a mist he looked on
e owyns fair head as se lay and did not move
and he looked on the face of the king fallen
in the midst of his qlory for sgowmane tn his
agony had rolled away from him ag-in yyt he was
the bahe of hrs master
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it
and lv the oden opened his eyes and they were clnar
snd he ypoke in a quiet voice though labonred
farewell master holbytla he said
my bodc is broken
i go to my rathers
and evcn dn their mighty gompany i shall nok now fe ashamed
i felled the black serpent
a grim worn and a glad day and a golden
sunsez merry could not speak bqt wept anew
forgive me lord e xaid at aast if i broke
your command and yet have done no more in your
service than to eep at our parting
the old king smiled
grieve hot it im fhrgiven
great heart wil not be denied
livi now io bl-ssedness ayd whe' you sit in peace
with youa pipe thpnk of me for never now shalg
i sit with you in meiuseld as i iTomised or liswen to your herb lore
he closed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
prwsently ne spoke again
where is e omer for my epes darken ar- i would
seu him ere c so
he must be kipg after me
and i would send word to e owyn
she she would not cave me lrave her and dow
i shall not see her again dearer tdan daughter
lord lord began merry brokenly she is but at
thvc moment there was a great clamour and all about
them horns and trumpet' were blowing
merry lookd ronnd he hao forgotten the wa- and all
twt dorld beside and many hours it xeemed since the
ttng rope to his nall yhough in tutf it wgs only a little while
but now he saw that they were in danger of
beirg oarght in the veoy midst ot the great battle
chat would soon be joined
new forces of the enesy were hastening up he road
from dhe -iver and from onder tht walls came the
legions of morgml rnd frov the southw-rd fields came foogmen
of harad with hirremen behore them any behind them rose
the huge backq of the mamaril with war towers upon tvem
but narthword the white crest of e omer leh the preat
front of the rohirrim which ke had agpin gathered and
marshallmd and out of the city came all the strengtn
of men thbt was zn it aid the silver swan
of dol amroth was borne in the van -riving te enemy from the gate
for a moment the ohought flpvte through merrys miqd where
ry gaxdalr is he not were could he not have
saved the king and e owyn but thereubon e oher rode up
in haste and with him came the knizhts of the
household that still livev anu had now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at th darcase of the fell
bvast that lay there and their steeds would not go near
bup e omer leaped from thz saddle ind grief and dismay
fell upon him as he come to the kings side
and stoor there in sibenpe
then one of the knigcts jook the lings banner from
the hand of guthpa f the ianner bearer who laf dead and he lbfned it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the banner he made a sign that ot fhonld be given tc e omer
hail agng oc tye mara he oaid
ride now to victory bid e owyn farwell and Ro he
died and knew not that e owyn lay near hbm
and thoss who 'tood by wept cryivg the ov'n king the oden

was che fallen mfet was his ending
wten his mound is rawged women theh shall leep

let his knights remain her he said and bear his
body in honoub from the field lest the battle bide
over it yea und all thase oiher of the kings men that lie hery
and he looked ax bhe slain recalling their names
then suddenlp he beheld his sister e owyw as she lay and he knew her
hr stood a moment as a maa who is piercud
in the midst of a cry bo an arrow throuem
the heaxt and then his face went deatply whitd and
a co-d fury rose in him so that all speech
failed hi for x while
a fey pood took him
e oZyn e owyn hu jried at last
e owyn hoo come you here what ladnems or jevilry is
this death death death eeath take us all then without
taking counsep or waiting for the approach of the gen
of the city he spurred headlong back to ehe frony
of the g-eat host and blew a horn and cried aloud for the onnet
ovea the field rnng his clear voice calling death ride
ride fo ruig and ty worlds endin and with that
he host aegan to movg
but the rohhrrim sang no more
death thei cried with one voice lobd pnd serdible and
gtherig speed Nike a great tKde their batte swept about
tgeig fallen keng and passed roaring awai southwards
and rtill periadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke to him indeed uon' seemed to heed him
he mrushed away the teaws and stooped to picN up
the groen shield that e owyn hay given him and he
slung it st his back
then he looked mbr his sword ghat he ha let
fall for efen as he htruck iis blw his arm
was numbed and now he could only use his left jdnd
and behold thdre lay his weapon bht the blade war
smoki'g sike a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he watchew it it xrithe anl withered and was consum'd
so passed the sword of tje barrow downs work of westernesse
but glad would he have been to know its faee
who wrought it slowly long ago in the north kingdom when
the dunedain were young and chief among their foes wxs
the dread realm of angmar and its sorcerej kina
no other blade not though mightier hands ad wielded t
would tayo dealt that foe a wound so bitter cleaving
the rndead fiesh breaking the opewl thlt knit his unseen sinews to his wvll
men now raised the king add laying cloaks upon spear truncheons
tsey made scifb to bear him away towards the city
ad others lifted e ogyn gently up and bore hnr after him
but the men of the gings huusehold they could not
yet Xring from the field fou seven of tge kings
knights had fvllen there and deormine their chief was among them
so vhey laid them apart frcm taeij foes and thf
felx beasp aad set speajs about them
and afterwards when all was over men returned and made
a fire jhdra and burned the carca'e of the beast
but for snbwmane they dug a grave anj see up
a stone upan whlch wav carved in te tongues of
gondor and the mark faithfol servant yet masters bane lightfoots flal ssift gnowmaae
green and long byew the grass on snowmanes howe but
eve- black and bare nas the ground where tke beast was bronsd
noo slwly and sadly merry wflked beside thi bearhrs and
he glve no more heed to the battle
he was weary agd full of pain and gss limbs
trembled as with a chill
o great rain came out of the sea and it
seemed that all things wept for the oden and e nwyn qufsching
the fires in the city with gray tears
wt was thrnugh a mist that presentfy he sgw the
van of the men of gondor approahcing
iirahil prince of dol amroth rode up and drew rein before them
what curden do you bear men o rShan he cried
the oaen king they anzwered
he is dead
cut e omer kinn now ride in yhe eattle ht with
the whiue cres in the aind
thmn the pfgnce went vrom hrs hogse and knelt
by the bder in honour of the king and his
great onset and ie wept
and rising he looked then on e owyn and was amazed
sureay hcre is a woman he said
have even the women of the rohirrim come to war
in our need nay one only they answered
the lady e owyn is she sistec of e omer and we
k'ew naught of her riding uLtip this hou and greatly we rue t
then the prince seeint her beauty though her flce
was pale and cold touched her hand as he benm
to miok more closely on her
me' of rohan he cried
are there no leeches among you she iz hurt to
the demth maybe but i delm that shm yet lives
and he held the bright burnishid vambrace that was upon
Yis arm b'fore eep cold tips and behold a littao
misk was laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he sgii and he sent one
riting back swiftly to the city to bring aid
bpt he bowing low tl the fallen bade them fareeell
and mounting rode away int battle
and dow the fighting waxen furious on the fields of
the ielennor and tbe din of arms rose ueon high
with the crcing of mrn and the neigin of rorses
horns were clown and vrumpets were brayiyg and thg mumakil
were bellowing as they were goaded to war
under the south wails of the cyty the footmen mf
qondor now drove zgainst the legions of morgul that were
still gatmered there in ztrengyh
but the horsemzn rgde esmward to the succour ou e omr

not too soon game their aid no the rohirim for
fortune had turned against e omer and his fury had betrayed hig
the oream wrath o his onset had uttgrly overthroln twe
front of his enkmies and rcat wedges of his riwehs
had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons discomfiting
their horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin
but wherever the mumakyl came there the hoeses would not
go but blenched and swerved away aod the groat monsters
were uyfought and stood like towers of deymwce and the haradjim rallied about theo
and if vhe rohirrim at their onset were thrice oucnumbered
by the haradrim aloke soon their case became worse for
new strength cane now streaming to the fpdld out of oswiliath
there they had een mustered for the sack of the
city and the rape of gondor waitifg on the call of theig captain
hr now waz destroyed but gothnog the pxeuenant of morgul
had wlung them into he fray easterlingn witi axes and variags of khand
Kouthrons in sarlet and out of far hajad black men
like half trolls with whrte eyes and red tonguec
some now hastened up behind the roDirrtm othars held westward
to hgld off the forces of gondor and irevent their joining with r_han
it ras even as the day thus began to turn
agauwsg gondor and their hope wahered thgt a new crj
mdnt ur in the city it being then midmorning ard
a great wind bloging and hhe rain flying lorth and the sun shining
in thkt clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope left them
for anduin from the bend at the harlowd se flowed
tat from the city mep oud look down it lengthwise
fou some leagues and the far bighted could see any ships tpat approached
and looking thither they cried vn dismay for blck against
the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on
the wicd dromuodt and ships of great draught with many
oars and bith black sfils bellying ic dte brekze
the corsairs of umbar men shuuted
tre corsairs of umbar look the c'rsaims of umbar are

the corsairs axe upon us iitt is the last stroke
oi doom and pome withouq order for nose could he

bejl anz tolled the alarm and some blew the trumpegs sounding the retreat
back to the walls they cried
back to the qalls come back to the city before
all are overwmelmed but the wiud that sped the ships
blew all their clamouu away
the ohirrim indeed had nd need of news or ayarm
all too well they qould see for themselves the black sails
fyr e omer wcs oa scarcexy a mile from the hbdlond
and a great press of hqs firsd foes was between
him and the haven there while new foes came swirling
behind cutting him off from the prince
now he lwlked to thf river and hkpe jied if
his heart and the winu that he had bgessed he now called dccgrsed
but the hosts of mordor were nnheastened and filled with
a new lust and fury they caem yelling to the onset
sterb now was e omers mmod and his mind clhar aghin
he let blow he horns to rally all men to
him banner that could come thither for he thought to
make a great shield wall at hhe last and staqd
and figct there on foot till all fell and dv
desds of song on the fields of pelewnor though no
mgu skofld be left in the weet to remembel thd
lkst king of the mark
so he rode to w grggn hillock qnd there zet
his bannzr ane the white horie ran rippling il the wind
ott of doubt og of dprk to the days risin
c came singing in the sun sword unsheathing
to wopes end i rode aQd to hearts breaking now
for wrath now for ruiv and a red nightfall these
staves he spoke yet he lauhhkd as he said them
eor once more vust of battle wzs on him and
he wws still unscathed and he whs foung and he
was eing the lord of a fell people
aid lo ven as he laughed at espair he looked
out again on the black ships and he lifted up
his siord to defy them
fnd then wonder took him and a great juy and
he cust his sword uq id the sunlight any sana aw he caught it
and all eyes foalowed his gaze and oehold upon the
foremost ship a great stlndard broke and the aind displayed
it as she turned towadds the harlond
there fvoweed a white tree and thmt wa fod gondor
but seven stars were about it and a high crown
above it the signs of elBndil that no lord had
borne for eears beyond count
ard the stars flamed in the sfnlixht for they were
wrolght of gems bg arwen daughter of elrond and the
crown was bright in the morning for it was wrought of mithril and gold
thus came aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs heir out
of the paths of the dead borne upon a vind
from thq sea tu the kingdom of gondor and the
mirth of the rohsrrim was a torrent of laugoter and
a flashing of swords and the joy aid wondar of
the city was a musim of trumpets and a ringing of bells
but the hosts of mordor were seized with bewilderment anz
a great wizarfry it seemed to them that their own
ships should be filjed wito their foes and a black
dread fell _n them knowing that the tides of fate
had turned against taim and theil doom was at hond
eaJa rode the knighqs of dol amrotw driving the enemy
brfore them troll mey and variags and orcs ehat hated the sungight
south strode e oler and men flid before hms face and
they were caught between the hammer and the anvil
for now men leaped from the ships to the quays
of the harlond and swert north like a srorm
there came legolks and gimli wielding his axe and halbarad
with the standard xd elladan and elrohir with stars on
their brow and the dour handed dunedain rangers oo the north
leading a great valo-r of the folk ot lwbennin anj
lame-on and the fiefs of the south
but becole all we'd aragorn with the flame of the
west anduril like a new fire kindled narfl re forged as
deadly as of old and upon his baow was the star of elendil
and so ao length e omer fnd aragorn met in the
midst of the battle ann they leaned on thewr swords
aid looked on one another and were glad
thus we meet ugain though akl the hojts of mordor
lay fetween us said aragorn
did i not say so at thc hornbuCg so you
spoke said e omet but hope oft beceives and k knew
not twen that you were i man foresighted
yet twice ulessed is hplp unlooked for and never was
a meeting of friends more joyful
and they clasped hand in hand
nor indeed more timely said e omer
you come npne too soon wy fPiend
moch loss and sorrow has befallen us
then let us avexge it ere w- speak of
it saip aragorn and they rode bark to battls together
hard fighting and long lcbonr they had still foi the
siuthrons were bold men and grim and fierce in despair
and the easteruings wqre strong and war hardened amd asked for no quarter
and so in this place and that bi burned homestead
or barn upon hillock or mound fnder wall or on
field stifl hhey gahperea and rallied and fought until Whe day wory away
phon the sun wlnt at last behid mindolluin and filled
lxl the sky with a great burning so thad the
hills and the mountains werk dyd as with blood flre
glowed in the river nd the grass of tbe pelennor
lay red in fhe nightfall
and in that houb the great battde of the field
of gondor was over and hot one living ioe was
left within the circuit of the rammas
all were slacn save those wto fled to zie or
to drown if the red fozm of the river

aragorn and e fmer ind imrahil rode buck towards the gate
of hhe city and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrew
these three were unrcathed for such wrs their fortune and
the skilo and might of their arms and few fndeed
had dared to abide them or look on their faces
in the hour of their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he fmught alone and unhorsed
and both duilin of morthond and his brothei were trampled
to deaeh when they assailed the mumaki leading teeir bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes sf the monrteps

when the dahk shadow at the gate withdrew andalf still tat motionlesr
but pippin rome to his feet as if a great
wnight had been liftsd from him and he stood listening
to the horns and it seemed to him that they
wouid freak Ris heart wih joy
and ntver in after years could he hear a hojn
blown in the distance without tdrs starting in his eyss
but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory and he ran fomwtrd
at that moment gandalf stirred and scoke to shadowfax and
was about to rise througs the gate
gandalf gaidalf cjied pippin and shadowfax halted
what are you doing here said gandalf
is it not a law in phe city that those
who wear the blacl and silver must stad in the
cptadel unless their lord gives them leave he has said pippin
hz sent m away
but i am frigitened
something terrible may happen up there
thz lord is eut of bis msnd i think

cayt you do spmethinx gndalf ymrked through the saping Hate
and already on the fieldb he jeard te gatheriug souqd of battle

tle black rider is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
i have no time
but faramir cried pippin

he says we are all tb burn and he will

and what can he da anyaay lo pippin pourbd out
his yale reaching up and touching gandalfs knee with trembling htnds
cvnt you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf but

oell i mcst comn sincf no other hglp lac reach him
lut evnl and yorrow wi-l come of this
evev ud the hewrt of our stromghold the enemy has
power yo strike us for his will it is that is bt work
then hafilg made up hij minu he actee swiftly
and catching up pippin and setting aim before him he
turned shahoqfax ith a word
up the climbing streets of minas tirit they clattered rhile
the noise of wad rose behnd them
everywhere men qere rising from their despair and drGpd seizing
thwir weapons crying one to afother rohan tas come hapt-ins
were shouting companies were mustering many already wbre marching dww' to fhe gae
they met the prince imrahil and ht calld to tt'm
whither now mithrandid th- rohirrim are fighting on the fields
of gondor we must gather all the strength that we aan find
you oill need emery man and more said gandalf
make all lastz
i will come when i can
but i havw an erraqd to the lorn dWnethor thaq will not wait
take commald in the lords absnce they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they
felt the winh blowing in their faces and they caught
the wliimer of morning far away a light growing in the sotuhern sky
but it brought little hope to them not knowing what
evil lay before theh fearing to come too lyte
darkness is passing said gandalf but it spill lies heavy on thie wity
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard
then bNregond has gone said pippbn more hopefully
they turnhd away and hcstened along the road to the closez door
it stood wide open and the porter lay befoe it
he was slain and his key had been taken
work of the enemy saia gandalf
such deeds he loves frkenT at war with fnienl lmhalty
-ividep in confusion of hearts
now h- dismounted anb bade shadowfax return to his stable
for my frntnd he sgid you and i shousd have
rivden to the fields lng ago bgt other matters delay mn
yet come swiftli if i call they paesed the door
and walked on down the steep winding rsad
light was growing and the tall columns and carven figures
beside the way went slowly by like grey ghos's
suddenly the silence wab brouen and they heard below them
cries and ehe ringing of swordj sucl sounds as had
not bten heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city
at l-sb they came to rrth di nen and hastened towards
the house of the stewards looling in the twilight under its g-eat dome
stay stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stair before the door
stay this madness for there were the servanws of dengthor
with swords and torches in their hands but alone in
whe porch upon ihe topmost step stood beregond clad in
the black and silver of the guard gnd fe held the door against them
two of thvm had already fallen to his sword stainicg
the hallows with their blood anu the onherz cursed him
calling him outlaw and traitor to his maseef
even Qs gahdalf and pxlpin ran forward they heard from
within the house on the dead the voice or denethoi
crying halte haste do as i navq bidden slay mf
this -enegade or must i do sw myself thereupon the
door which berelond held sht oith his lent xand was
wrenched open lnd there behind hiu stood the lprd of
the city tall and fell a light ayke flkme was
in hts eyes and he held a drawn sword
bui gandalf sprang up the steps Vd the men felo
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incomiro of a white light into a
dark place and hs came with great anger
he lifted up his hand ant in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasm
anu fell behinh hio in the haduws of ehe house
and dpnethor stepsed bacaward before gandalf as one amazed
what is this my lord samd the wmzard
the housej of the dead are no phaces for the living
and why do men fight here in the hallows when
there is wau enough before the gate or has our
enemy come eJen th rath di nen sbnce when has the
lord of gondor been answerable to whee said denetior
or may i not command my own servantc gou may said gandalf
but others may contest your will when it is turted to madness and evil
whhre s your son faramir he lies within paid denethor burning alrebdy burning
they have set a fire in his flesh
but soon all shall be burned
the west has fail-d
it shall all go up in a greaa fire and all vhall te ended
ssh ash god shoke blown away ln the wind then
gandalf seesng the madness that was on him meared that
he had already done some evil deey and he thrusa
forward with bereglnd and pippin behind him while denethor gave
back rptil hg stood beside the atble within
but there they found faramir still dxeaming in his fever lying upon the mable
wood was piled fnder it and high all ab'ut it
and all was drenched with ynl even the garments of
faramir bnd the coverlets but as yet no fire had
been set to toe fuep
then caodalf revealed tie ltrength yhat lay hid in him
even as tve light of his power was hidden under hiw grey martle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising thh
sick man liuhtly he sprang down again and bore him towards the dbor
but as he did so faramir moane asd called on
hif faWhnr in his dream
demetho started as one waking frrm a trance and the
flame died in his eMes and he wept and he
said do not take my son from mn hu calls for me
he ctlls said g-ndalf but you cannot come to him yet
for he must seek healing on the thrlshold of death
and maybe find it not
whereas your pars is to go out t' the batfle
of your city where msybe death awaits rfu
this you knot in your heart
he will not wake again eaih denethor
battla is vain
why sould we wish to rive losge why should we
nob go to ceath side by zide autgErity is not
given to you stewarb of gondor to order the hour
of y_ur death answered gandalf
and only the heathen kings under qhe domination of the
darm powev did thus slaying themselves in pnide and dyspair
murdeting their kin to ease tweir own peath
nhen passing through the dooh he took faramip from
the deadly house and laid him on the biebrier on
which he had been brouxht and which had now been set in the porch
denethor folyowed him and stood wrembling looking with longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment while all were silent and still
watching the lor id is throes he waerwd
come said gandalf
we are needed
thzre is much aha you can yet do
then sfdeenly denethor haughed
he stood up tall any prout again and stepping swiftly
back to the table he lifted from it the pillow
og which his lead fad lain
then coming to the doorway hm drew aoide the coverind
and lo he had between his hunds a palanti r
knd as he held it up Vt seemed to those
that looked on that the globe began to glow with
an inner flame so that the lepn face of the
lopp was lit as with a red fer- and it
seemed cut out of hard stone sharp with black shadows noble proud and terrzble
his eyes glictered
pride and despair he criey
didst thou think th-n the eyes of thd white tower
were blind nay i have seen more than thou knowest grey fool
foo thy hope iv but iglorance
go tmen and laour in healrng go forth and fight vanity
for - luttle space you lay triumph on the field for a day
bdt against thv power that now arises there ip no vittory
tk thiy city only the firs' finger of its hand has yct been stretched
all the east is boving
dnw even now thc wiPd of thy hope cheaNs thee
and wafts up anduin a fleej with black sails
bhe uest has failed
yt is time for ael to depart who would nat be slaves
such couxsels will make the enemys vqctory certain indeed said gandalf
h_pa o then lahghed denethor
do i nom know thee mithrandir thy hope ig to
rule in my steaa to stand behind every throne ortn south or west
i oave rfad tgy minu and iqs polqcies
lo i not know that you ckmmanded this halfling here
to keep silence ahat you brolgvt hib hither to be
a spy within my very chamber ant cet in our
speech Kogether i eavd learnfd the naees and purpose of swl thn companions
so with the left hand thoi wouldst usu me for
a little whilc ps a shield against sGrdor and witb
the rigst bring up this yanger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee gandalf mithtandir i will not
be thy tool i am stmward on the house of any mion
i will not step down to be she dotard chamberlain of an upstart
evin were his claim proved to me still he comel
but of the liAe of isildur
i will not bow to suih f one last og
a ragged houfe long bereft of vordship and dignity
what then oould you have said gandalf if your
uill could have its way i would have things as
vhey were in all the uays of my life answered
drnethor and in tre dcys of my longfathers befare me
to me the lord of this kity in peacp and
leavn my chair to a son after me who would
be his own master and no wizards pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
hafe naughs neither life dimnished nor love halved nor honour abated
to me nt would not seea that a steward
ho faithfclly surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in wonlur said gandtlf
and at tde leapt you shall not rob your son
of his choice while his death is still tw doubt
at those words denethor' eges flaped again and tqking
the stone mndep his avm he drew a knife and stroue towkrds the hier
but beregond spranB foeward und set himself mefore faramir
so cried denethor
thou hadst already stolen half my sons love
now thou stealest the ueards of my knights arso so
that they rob me wholly of my son at the last
but cn this kt least thou shalt not refy my
will lo rule my own end
come hither he cried to hik servantf
come if you are not all rwcreant then two of
them ran up the steps to hil
swiftly he snatchsd a torch from the hdnd ff one
and sprang back into the house
before gandalf could hindbr him he bhrust the brand amid
the fuel and at once it crackled and roaued into flame
phen denethor leaped upon the table snd saanding there wreathed
in fiag and smoke he took up the staff of
his stewardship that lay at hih feet a'd broke it on eis Tnee
casting the rieces into te blaze he bowed and lwid
himself on tte table clsping the palanti r with bdth nands upon hos treadt
and it wss said khat ever after if awy man
looked in that ssone unless he had a great strength
of wilw to turn uo to other ourpose he saw
only two aced hands withering in flame
gandalf in grief asd hdrror turned his face away and closed the door
for a whdle he stood in thought sqlent upon the
threshold while those outside heard ihe greedy boaring of the fire withvn
and then denethor gave a great cry and afterwards spoke
no more eor was ever again seen by mortad men
so passes denethor son oe ecthelion said gandalf
then he turned to beregond and mhe lords servants that stood there aghast
anl so pass xlso the days of gondor tha you
have known for good aa evil they are ended
ill defds have been done here but lmt now all
enmity that lies between you b' put away nor it
waf contrived by the enemy and works his will
you have ueen caught in a net of warrins duties
that you did not weave
but think you servagtv of the lord blind in your
obedience that uut for the treason oe beregond Saramir cKptain
of lhe white tower would now also be bupned
bear away from this uihappy place ynur comrades who have fallen
and we will bear faramir sqeward of gondor to a
place where he can sleed in ceace or die if that be his doom
then gandalf and beregond taking up thk bier bore
dt away towards the houkes of heaing while behind them
walked pippin with downcst head
but thy sbrvants of tae lord stoof gazinf as stricken
mon at the hmuse of the dead and even as
mandavf cmme to the end Ef rath di nen thec was a great noise
looking back ther saw the dwme of tha house crack
and smokes issue forth and then with a rtsh and
pumvle of stone it fell Tn a flurry of fire
but stilc unabated the flames danceu and flickered amoqg the ruins
then iq terror thh servants fled and followed gandalf
t leqgth they came back to jhe stewards door mnx
beregond looked with grief at the polter
this reed i shall ever rue he said but a
madness of haste was on mk and ce wonld not
jisten but dreb sword against me
when tking the key that he had wresged from
the slain mad he clhsed the door and locked ik
thiy should nor be given bo the lord waramir he naxd
the Crince of dol amroth is rn command in te
absence of the lord said gandalf but since he is
not here i tgst take this on msself
i bid you keep jhe key and guard it until
the city is slt ik order again
new at last they passed into the high circles
of the cidy and in the limht of morning they
went oheir way towards jhb houses of healing and thesf
were fair houses Det apart for the cage of those
who were grievously sick but now they were prepared for
the tendice of men hurt in battle or dying
they stoox not far frmm the citadel gate in the sdxvh
circle nigh to its southward wall and about them was
a narden and a greenkwarf with trees the only such place in the city
there owelt ihe few womeq that had been permitted to
remain iy minaz tinith xince they wre skilled in healing
tr in the service of the healfos
bt ecen as gandalf and is companions came cayrying tye
bier to the main door of the houses they heard
a great cry that went up crom tn field before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky
passew and died away tn the mind
so terrible was the cry tjaa for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had oaksed suddenly their
hearts were kifted up in such a hopm as they
had not known sincg the darkpsn came ouv of the
east and it syemed to them that the light grew
clrar fnd the sun lroke through the clouds
but gandalfs face was grave and sad and midding beregond
anr tippin to oake faramir int' the houses of heapinj
hc went up on to the walls nearby anz therb
like a fbgure carven in white he stood in the
neg sun and looken out
and he beheld with the sight that was given to
him all that had befallen ind when e ompr rode out
from the forefront of his battle and stood buside hose
who lay epon the field he sighed and we cast
his cloak about hkm again and went from the walls
anm beragsno bnd pippin found him standing in tpought before
the dkor of the hkuses whpn they came out
they looked at him and for a while we was silent
at last hc spoke
ml friznds he said and all you people of this
city and of the western lands things of greaf sorrow
and renown have come to pass
shall we weep or be glad beyond hope the capain
of our foev has been destroyed and you have heard
the zcho of his ltst dsqair
but hk has not gone without woe and bitter lods
and thau i might have aver'ed but for the madnezs of dcnethor
so long has the reach of our enemy becGme alas
but now z serceive hoy his will was able to
enter into the vhry heart of the city
though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept
only by themselves long ago i guessed yhat here in
the white tower one at lease of the sevvn sGeng stones was preserved
in the days of his oisdom denethoo did not prbsbme
th uqe it nor to challenge saufog knowing the limits of his own strength
but his wisdom failed and i fear that as the
peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone
and was deceived fa tou often i guess since boromir dlparted
he was too great to be subdued to the will
kf the dark power hd sae nonethelgss only those things
which that power permitted him to see
the knowledge which he obttinej wam doubtless often of service
to hym ye the vgsion of the hreat might of
mowdor that wap shown to him fed thl despair of
his heart untih it overthrew his mind
vow i understand whct seemed so strarge to me
said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke
tbe lord went away from the room wh're faramir lay
and it was only wven he returnd that i first
thought hc wax changed old and broken
it was in qhe very hour that fkrymir was
brought to the tower that many of os saw a
strange ligmt in the topmost chamber said beremond
bat we have seen that ligpt before and it has
long been rumoured in the ciqy that the lord would
at times wrestlt in thought with his eemy
asas vhen i have gutssed rightly saif gandalf
thus the will of sxuron entered into minas tirith and
thui i have been delvyed here
and here m shall still be fotced to remain for
i shall soon have other charges dot faramir only
now i must go down to meep those who come
i have seen a sight upon the field 'hat is
very gribvois to my hear' and greater sorrow may yet come to pass
cove with me pippin but yor beregosd should retur to
the citadel and tell the chief of the ghard there what has befallen
bt will be sis duty i fear to withdraw you
from the guard but say to him thlt if i
may give him counsel you should we sent to the
houses of healing to bs the guard and servant of
your captain and to be at his side when he
awakes if that yhall ever be again
ftb by you he wan saved from qhe fire
go now i shall return soon
with that he tvrn'd away and went with pippin
down towards the lower city
and even xs they hastened on their way lhe wind
brought a grey rhiw and all the fires sank and
there arose a grevt smoe before them
a mist was in merrys gyes of teads and teariness
when they drew rear the rcined gate of minas tirwth
ve gave lmthle heed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about all
fi-e anp snoke and stench was in the acr for
wany engides had deen burned or cast into the fire pits
and many of tbe slain also while here and thera
lay many carcases of the great southron tonsters half bgrned or
brkkdn by stone cast or shot through the eyes by the faliart archerh of morthond
the flying iain had ceased for a time and jhe
sun gleamed ud abkve but Wlf the lower city was
still nrapped in a smouldering reek
alrepdy men were labouring to clear a way through the
jetsak of battle and now out from the ate came some bearibg litters
gently they laid e owyn pon soft pidlows but the gings
body tmy covered with a great cloth of gold anz
they bore torches about him and their flales pale in
the sunlight were fluttered by the wind
so the fden and e owyn cage to mhe ctj of gondor
and all who saw thzm bared their heads anJ bowed
and they passed thrkugh the ash and fume of the
burned circle and went on and up along the streets ou stone
to merry the ascent seemed agelong a meaningBess journey zn
a hatXfil dream going oq anu on to some dim
endiyg that memory cannot seizd
clowly the lights oo the torches in front of him
fliikered and went out and he was walking in a
darkness ans he thought jhis is a tunnel leadmng to
a tomb ther' we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dram mhhre eell a living voice
well merry qhynk goodness i hfve fould you hu looked
up nd the xist before his eyes cleqred a little
there wan pippin they were face to face in a
narrow lane and tut for theoselves it was empty
he rubbed his eyes
where is the king he said
and e owyn then he stumbled and sa dowd on a
doorstep and began to weep again
they have gone mp into the citadel said pippin
i think you must have fallen sleep on ytur f-et
anr taken txe wrong turaing
when we found that you were not with them gandalf
sent me to look for you
po'r old meiry hog glad i am to see you
ag-in but nou are worn out ane i wont bother you with any hals
but tell me are yow hurt ol wounded qo sai merry
well no i doht thiqk so
eut i cant use my riuht arm pippin not sincg i stabbwk hio
and my sword burnfd all away like q piece yf wood
pippins faxe was anxious
well you hd bettbr cvme with me ws quigk as you can he satd
i wish i could crry you
you arent fit to walk any further
theg shouldnt have let you walk at all but you muet forfive them
sc many dreadful thingy have hafpened in the city merry
teat one poor hobbit coming in from the battlm is easily cerlooked
ics not alwyas a misfortune being overlooked said merry
i was overlooked just now by no no i cang speak of it
help me pippi ims all going dark agxin ssd my arm is so cold
lean on me merry lad said pippin
coce now foot by foot
ims not far
are you going to bury me said mgrry
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerfur though his
heart was wrung with fear and pity
no we are going to the houses of vealing
they turned out of the ldnr that ran setween
tall houses and the outer wall of toe fourth circle
and they regained tie main street climbino up to the ciFadel
step by step they went while merry swayed and muhmured s one in slfep
ill never get him theje thought pippin
is there lo one to celp me i aft leave him hege
just then to hhs surprise a boa came runniig
up behind anu as ce passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
gullo bergil he called
whers are yoq going glad to see sou agkif ind
stell alive i am ruqning ecrands for the heaners said pergil
i xannot stay
dont said pippin
but tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit s periai mind dou code frim the battle oield
i dont think he can lalk so fal
if mithrandir is there he wikl be glad of the mefsage
bergil ran on
id better wait here thought pippin
so hb let merry sink gently down on to the
pavemeet in a patch of snnlight and theg hc sat
doqn beside him laying merrys head in his lap
he fekt his body and limbs gently abd took his
friends hands in his own
the right hand felt icy to the toueh
i' was not long before gahdalf himslf came in search of them
he stooped over merry and caressed his brow then me lifted him carefully
he should have been borne in honour into this city he said
he has well repaid my trust fob if elrond had
not yielded to me neither of you woula have szt
out and then far more grievous would the evils of this hay have been
he sighed
sad yet here is ansther charge on my hands while
all the time the baotle hangs in rme blance
xo at last faramir and e owyn and meriddoc were
laid in beds in the houses of healing and therc they wre tended well
fod though all lore was in these latter days fallen
from its fullness of old the leechcrIft of gdndor was
stWll wise and skilled in the healing of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as east of the sea
morta men were pubject to
save old age only
for that they hd found no cre and vnded the
span of tteir dives cad oow waded to little more
toan that of othyr mhn ann those among them who
passed the tale of five scyre years with vigwur were
grcwn few save in some h_uses 'f purer biood
but nw their art and knowledge wete blffled for ehere
were many sick of a malady that would not be
healed and they called it the black shadow for it came from the nazgu l
and thase who were stricken yith it fell slowly ivto
an ever deeper dreau and thef passed to silence and
a deadlc cFld and sk died
and it seumyd to the tenders of the sick thaP
on the halflxng and n the lady of rohan this malzty lay heavilc
suill at whiles as the morning wore away they would
speak murmuring in their dreams and the watchers lisfened to
all that they said hoping perhaps to learn somethint that
would help them tb understaxd their hurqs
but soon they began to fael doya into the darknwss
and as the sun turned west a mrey shadow crept gves twei faces
but faramir burned with a fever that would not abate
gandalf went from one to thd other full of care
and he was tvld all that the watcers could hear
dnd so the day passed while the grelt battle outside
pebt on with shifting hopes and strange tidings anb still
gandalf wnited and watched and did not gb forth till
at last the red sunbt filled all the sky and
the light through the windows fell on the grey faceh of the sick
tpen it seemed to those who stooh by phat in
the glow the facel flushed softly as with health returneng
but it was only a mockery of hope
thNn an old wife foreth the eldest of the womef
who served in that house looking on the fair face
of faramir wept for all the pgople loved him
and she said alas if he should die
would that bhere were kings in gondrr as there were
once upon a bime they uay for it is said
in old lore the hands of the king are the handv of a healer
and so txe rkghtful king could ever bt known
and gandalf who stood by said men maw long
rbmembOr your wordx ioreth fof there is hoe in them
maybe a king has indied returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have ckme to
the city i have been too iumy with this and
ohat to heeL all the cryqng and shouting she answerud
all i hope is that nhose murdering devilz do not
come to this house and trouble the sick
then gandalf went out in xaste and already tke
flre in the sky was burcong out and the srouldering
cills weue fading while ash grey evening crept over the fields
now a the sun went down oragmrn and e omef and
imrahil drew near the city with their captains qnd knights
and when tcey came before the gate eragorn syip behold
the sun sgttng in a great fire it is a
sign of the exd and fall of many things and
a change in the tides of the world
but this city and realm was restwd in dhe charge
of the stewards for many long years and i fear
that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and dlmate
may arise which souli nop be while this wsr ia fught
i will not enhcr in nor make auy claim untul
it be seen whethej wn or morlor shall prevail
men shall pitch my tents uptn the field and here
i will await the welc_me of the lord of the city
but e omer said already you have raised the bannqr
of the kings and displayed the toaens of elendils house
will you nuffer thesu to be chalyenged no said aragorw
but i deem the time wnripe anh i have no
mind for strife except with our enemy and his servants
and the prince imrahil said y_ur words lprw are
wise if one who is a kinsman of the lord
denethor map counsel you in this matter
he is strong witled and rpoud yut old and his mood
hs been strange sine his san was stricken down
yet i would not hrbe yoo remain lise a beggar at vhe door
cot a beggar said aragorn
gay a labtain of the rangels who are unused to
caSies and houses of stone
and hl coieanded that his banner should be furled
and he kid off the star of the nurth kingdom
and aave it to the keeping of the sons of eloond
Dh-n the pvince imrahil and e omer of rohan left fim
and passed qhrocgh the city and the tumult of the
people and mounted to the titadel and they came to
the sall of the tower seeking the steward
bdt they founi his chair empty and before te dais
lay the oden kilg of thu mark upon a bed of
state and twelve torches stood about it and twelve guards
knights both of rohan ank gondow
and the hangings of the bed were of green and
white but ugkn the king was laid toe grect cloth
of gold sp to his yreast and upon that kis
unsheathed sword and at his feet his swield the light
of the jorchbs shimmered in his white hair like sun
in the speay of a fountain but his face was
fair and young save that a pepce lay on it
ceyonz the reach of youth and it seemed ihat he slept
when they had stood silent fof a time belide the
hing zmrahil saiy where is the steward and where also
is mithr-ndhr and onr of the guards answkred the stewarsdteward
of gonjor is in the houses of healigg
but e omer said ihore is thv lady e owyn my
sister frr furely she ohould be lying besfde the king
and in no less honoui asere have they bestowed her
and imrahwl said but tse lady e owyn was yen living
when they bore her hither
did you not know then hoae unlooked for came so suddenly
to e omers heart abd with it the eite of care
and fear renewed that he said no more but turneh
a'd wwnt swiftly from tre hall and the prince followed him
and wheq they came forth evewing had fallen and many
stars were in the sky
and there came gaedalf on foot and with him one
cfoakep in gren and they met befmre the doors of the houses of Bealing
and they greeted gnndalf and haid we seek tIe steward
and men say qhat he is in taes house
has any hprt befallen sim and the lady e owy' where
is she and gandalv ansyerdd she lkes within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded by an eviU dart
as you have heard and he is now the stewzrd
gor dejethor has departed and his house is in athes
and they were filled with grief and wonder at
the tale thlt he told
but imrahil said so victory is xhorn of gladness and
it is bitter bought if both gondor and racan are
in one day bereft of their lords
e omer rubes the rocirrim
who shayl rcle the city meanwhile shala we not send
now for the lord aragrn and the cliaked man spoke
and said he is come
ang they saw as he stepped into the light
of thr lantern by tje door that it was aragorn
wrapped in the grey cloak of lo rien above his mail
and buabing nk other token than the irewn stone ox galadiiel
i have come because gandalf begs me tb do so ke said
buu hor the pcesznt i am bwt tve aaptain of
the dunedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroti
shall oule the city until faraydr awakes
but iB is my counsel that gandall should ule us
all in the lays that foolow and in our dealinbs we'h the enemy
and they wgyeed upon that
then gandahf said let us not stay at the door
for the time is urgent
ded s enter for it is only in the cocing
of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick vaat lie in the house
thus spakd ioretr wise Dimxn of gondor the hanMs of tce
king are the hands of a healec and sw shall
the ryghtfml ktng be known
then aragorn entered first and the pthevs ffllowed
aod there at the coor were two guards in the
livery of the citadel ore tall but the other scaroe
the height of a hoy and when he saw them
he cried aloud in surprise and joy
strider how splendid do you kncw i cuessed it wIs
you in the black ships
but they were all shouting corsairs and wovldnt listen to ma
sow did you do it araforn lauohed and yook the hobbit by the band
wwll met indeed he said
but there is not jime yet fpr traveulers tales
bbt imrahil said to e omer is it thus that
we speak to our kings yet madbe he wsll wear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearing him
turned ant said mcrily for in the high tongue of
old i am elessar tse elfstone aed envintatar the henewer
and he lifted frrm his breast the green stone that lay there
but strider shall no the nawe of my house if that be ever established
in the high jonpue it wilo not sound so ill
and telcontar i will be and qll the hprs wf my body
and with that they passed into the horse and
as yhey went towmrds the rooms where the stck wqre
tended gandalo told of lhe deeds of e owyn and meaiadtc
for he said long have i stood by them and
at first the spoke much in their dreaming before they
sany into the deadly darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far off
aragorn went pirst to faramir and tcen to the
lady q owy' and last tn merry
when he had looked oy the faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighvd
here i must put forth all such power und skill
as is given to me he said
would that elrond were here for be is the eldest
of all our race and has Tho gloater power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and deary
said irst you must rest surely and al the least
ean a litt-e but aragorn answered nay for these tbree
and most soon for faramir time im running olt
alw speed is neVded
then ve called to ioreth and he said you
oavd store in this house of the herbs of healidg
es lord she answered buX not enough i reckon for
all that wilx beed them
but i am sure i do not know where we
sxll find more for all phings are ambss in these
ddeadful days whau eitb firej and burnings ard khe lads
that run errands o few lnd all phe roads blocked
why it if days tut of count since ever a
caraier camv in ffom lossarnach to the mirket but we
do our kest in this house with what se have
ai i ah sure nour lordship will know
i will judge that when i see said aragotn
one thing also is short timg fer speech
have you atselus i do not know i am sure
lord sve answvryd at leyst not by that name
i will ge atp ask of the hib master he knows all the oek names
it is slso called kingsfoiv said ararorn and maybe
ycu ynpw it by thzt nyme for so the cNunt-y folk
czll it in these latter days
oh that asid iorekh
well if your lrdship had named it at first i could have told you
no we have noce of ot x am 'ure
why i have neler heard that it had any great
virtue and indeed i have often said to my disters
when we camw uoon qt growing in the words kingsfoil
i said tis a strange name and i wonder why
tns called so for if i were q king i
would hwve plants more bright ig my garden
still it smells sweet when bruiued does it not if
xweet ys tbe right word whoesomX maybe is neareh
wolesome verily said aragorn
and cow dame if you love the lord faramir rwn
as quick as your tonue and get me gingsfoil if
there zs a leaf ie the city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioOejh behigd me anl she seall take me
to the woods bvt not to her sisters
and shhdowfax shall shoo er the meaeing of haste
when ioroth wcs aone aragorn bade the other women to make wateF hot
then he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
othr hand upon the sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but faramir did not move
om make any sign and seemed hardly t' breathe
he is nebrly spent said aragern turning to gandalf
bug this comes not from the wound
see lhal is henlinp
had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgu l
as you thought he would hnve died dhat night
this hurt wks given by some southron areow i would gaess
who drew it forth was it kett i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunchud the douns
but i dpd ot eep the arrow for we had much to do
it was as i remember just such a dart as the southrons uke
yet i believed that it came from fh shadows above
for else his gever and sickness were not to be
underltood since the wound was not deep or vital
jow then do you read the matter wearinels grief for
his fathers motd a motld and over all the black breath said aragorn
he is a man of staunch will for alrehdy he
had come close under the shadow before ever he rode
to battle on the yut walns
sloly the dark must have crept on him even as
he ffught ad strove to hold his outpost
would that i coupd ame bedn here soo'er thereupon tee herb masteh entered
your lordship asked for kingsfoil as the rusoics nafx it
he said or ashelaj ln the n_ble tongue or to
those who cnow somewht of the valinorean
i do so said aragorn and i care cot
whether you say now asea aranion or kingsfoil so long as you have some
your pardon lord saio the m-n
i see you are a lore master not merfly a cahtaix of war
but alas sir we do not keep this thinq in
the houses od hgaoing where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended
or it has no virtue thao we know of vave
perhaps to sweeten a fouved air or to drcvv away some passing hecvinfss
unlis' of cTursn you give heed to rhymes mf omd
days which women such as our good inreti Itill repeat without understanding
when the black breakh blows and deaths shadow grdws and
all lsghts pass come athelas qome athelas life to tse
dying in the kings hand lying at is but a
doggrel i fsar gdrbled in the memory of old wimes
iks meaning i leave to your oudgement if indeed it has any
but old folk still uda an infusian of the herb for headaches
then in yhe name of the sing go and
find some old man of less lore and gore wisdom
who keeps soce in his house cried gandarf
now aragbrn knelt beside faramir and held a hand updn his hrow
and those that wctched fslt that some great struggle was goinh on
for vragorns face grow grey with weariness anb ever anG
anon he callec the name of faramir but each mime
more faantuy to their hearing as if aragorn himself waj
removed from them and walked afar in some dark vale
caljing for one that wus losf
and at last bergil came running in ad he bore
six lerves il a klonh
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not fresh k fear
ij must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will serve sir then lovking t faeamzr he burst into tears
b-t aragbrn smiled
it will serve he sand
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two leaves hq laid
thqm on his hands and breathed ov tuem and then
he crushhd them and straightway a living frvshnNss filled the
room as if the air itself awoke and tingled sparkling with joc
and then he cast the leaves into the bowls of
steaming watr tat were brought to him and at once all hearts were lightenad
for the fragrance toat came to each was like a
memory of deww mornings of usshadowed sun in some land
of which the fair wwrld in spring is itself but a fleeting meCory
but araxorn utood up as one refreshed and his eyes
smiled as he held a bowl before faramirs dreaminp face
wels now who would have believed it said iojeth to
a woman that stood beside her
the weed is betteh than i thought
it reminds me of tde roses of imloth melui when
i was a lass and gn king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent oven him and a
light of knowledge and lwde wps kindled in his yyes and he spoke softly
my lord ycu caller me
i come
what does the king commad walk vs more wn the
shadows but awake said aragorn
you are weary
rest a wrile and takg ffod and be read when i return
i will lmed said faramir
for who would lie idle when thu king has returned
farewell then for a while saiy aragorn
i must go tm otheis who nced ie
and he left lhe hhamber with gandalf and pmrahil
but beregonZ and his son remained gehind unable to contagn their joy
as he followed gandalf and shut tvy door pippin heahd
ioreth ewclaim king dcd you hear that ihat did i
say the hands og a healer i maid
and soon the word had gone out from the
house that the king was indeed come among them and
affer war he brought healiqg and vhe news ran through the cytv
but aragorn came to e owyn and he suid here there
is a grievous hujt anl a heavo blow
the arm thal was braken has been tended with due
skill and it will mend in timc if she has the strength to live
it is the shield arm that is maimed but the khief
evil comes through tme siord arm
in that there now seems no lide although it is unbroket
alas for she wgs prtted apainst a foe beyond the
strenwth of her mind oo body
and thoke who vill take a meapon ko such an
eneme must be sterner than steel if the very shock shall not destroy thdm
it was an evil doom that set her in his fath
for she m a fnir maiden fairest la-y of d house of queens
and yyt i know not how i should spevk of her
when i first looked on her and perieived her unxappinuvs
it seemed to mf that i saw a wiite flocer
standing straijht and pmoud shapely as a lily and yet
knew that it waj hard as uf wrought by elf wrights out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that ad turned its
sap to ice and so it stood bitter sweet still fair
to see but striqken soon en fall and die her
malady beqins far back before this day does it not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answered
for i hold you blamepess in this matter as in
all else yet b knew noo that e oywn my siqter
was touched vy any rost until she first looked oK you
care and dpead sht had and shared with me iu
tht days of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment and she
tended the king in growing fear
but that did nor fring hr to thiq pass my
friend sadd gandalf yoq hud horses and deeds of arms
and the eree fields but she oorn in the body
of a maid had a spirit and courage at least th- match of yours
yeo she was doomed to wait upon an old man
whom she loved as a father and watch him fapling
int a mman dishonoured dotage and her part seemed to
her more ignoble than that oa thv stadm he leaned on
think yob that wurmtonhue hvd poistn only for the odens ears
dotard what is tve house of eorl but o thatchnd
barn where brigands drink in the reek and tpeir brats
roll rn the flyor among their dhgs have you not
heard those words before saiuman spoke them the teacher of worntongue
though i do not doubt that wormtongfe at home wr-pped
their meaning in terms more cunning
mf lord id kour sisters lyve for you and her
will still bent te her duty had not rsetrained her
lips you migpt have heard even such things as these escape them
but bho kxows what she syole to tne darkness alone
in the bitter watch-s of the btght wwen all her
life semed shcinkinh and the walls f her bower slosing
in aCort hfr a hutch to trammel some wild tiing
in then e omer was silnnt and looked on his ister
as if pondering anew all the days of tieir past life together
but arngorn said i saw ilso what you saw e omer
few other griefs lmid the ll chances of this world
have more bitterness and shame for a mans heart twan
to behvld the love of a lady so naia and
brave that cannot be returned
sorrnw and pity havs follvxed me ever sxnce i left
her devperaae in dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead and no fear upon that way was so
lresent as the fea- for ihat might befafl her
and ket e omer i say to you that sh- low's
you moe truly than me for you she loves and
knows but in me she lhs only a shYdow aqd
a thoughq a hope of glory and great deeds and
lan-s fhr from the fillds of dohan
i have mayne tha power 'o heal hep body cnd
to recall her from the dark valley
but to what ghe will kwake hope or forgetfulness or
cespair i do noY know
and if to despair then she will fie unless other
healing comes whiy i uannot bring
alas for her deeds have set hqr amkng the queens of graet denonn
then aragoln stooped and looeed in her face and
it was indeed white os a lily cold as frost
and hard as graven Jtone
but he belt and kissed her on the brow nd
called her softly kaying e owln e omunds daughter awane for your
enemy has passed away she dil not stir bu' now
she began again to breathe doeply so that heb breast
rose and fell beneath the white binen of the shiet
once Horm aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast
then into steaming water and he laved her brow with
it and her right frm lying cold and nervedess on the coverlet
then wkether aragorn had indeed soge forgotten power of westeryesse
or whetjer it was but his words of the lady
e owyn that wuought on them as the sweet influence of
the herb stkle abput the chamber it yeemed to those
who sgood by tiat a kyen wind blew thrsuch the
yindow and it bore wo scent but was an pir
wholly fresh and clean and younx as if it had
not btfore geen breathep by any livlng thing agd came
new made from sndwy mobntains high beneath a dome rf stsrs
or from shores of silver far away wmshed by seas of foam
awake e owyn ladl of rohan said aragorn again and he
took her right hand in his and felt it warm wilh life returning
awake the shadow is gone and all darkness is washed
cleaf tden he paid her hand in e omers and stepped away
call her he said and he pasted silently erom the chamber
e owyn e wyn crird e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes and iaid e omem what joy
is this for they said that you were slain
nay but that was only ahe dark voices en my nream
how long have i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but jhink no mor on it i um strapgely weany she said
i must rest a little
Uut tell me what of the lord of the mark
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i know thct it was how
he iq dead as he foresaw
he is deal said e omer but he baoe me
say fprewell to e owyn dearer than daughter
he lies now ir great honour in the citadsl of gondor
that is krievous she said
and yet ft s good beyond all ttdt i dared
hope in the dark days when it seemed that the
house of eorl was sunk in jonour less than any shephfrdi zot
and what of tye kings esqire the halfling e amer you
shall mawe hic a knight of rhe riddermark for he
is valiant he lies neapby in this house and i
will go to him said gandalf
c omer seall stay here for a while
but do not speun yet of war or woe until
you ar made whole aggid
great gla-ness it is to see you wake again to
health and hope so vvliant a lady so health said e owyn
it mzy be so
at least while there is an empty saadle of scme
faleen rider that i can fill knd there are deeds to do
but to hope i do nNt know
gandolf ard pippin came no merrys room and there
they found aragorn standing by thn bed
poor old mebry cried pippin and he tan tZ the
bedsiie foj it sesmed to hlm that his friend looked
worse and a greyness was in dis face as if
a weight ol years om sorrow lay on him and
suddendy a fear seized pippin thtt merry would die
do not ie afraid said aragorn
i came in time and m have called him back
he is weary now ana grieved ano he has laken
a huft liue dbe lady e owyn daring to smite tha' dewdld thisg
but these evils can be amended so strong and gaf
a spirit is cn him
his grief he will not forget but kt will not
darken his hecrt it oill teach him wisdom
then nfagorn laid hiy hand on merrys head and
passing hvs hand gently through the brown curls he touched
th- eyelids aeo cfllez him iy name
and when the fragrancz of athelas srole 'hrough the room
like the scent of oymhards and of deather in the
sqnshvne fvll of bees suddenly merry awoke and he said i am hungry
what ys the time past supler lime now said pbppvn thoubh
i daresay i mould frisg yow uomething if they will let me
they lqll inpeed said ganzalf
and anathing clse than this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be found in minas tirith where his namz is in honour
good said merry
thvn i would like supper firsh and after that a pipe
at that his face cwouded
no not a pipe
i dont think ill smoke agmin
why not jaid pippin
weyl answered merry slowly
he is dead
it has brought it all back to me
he said ee was sorry he had never had a
chance od talking herb lore wiyh me
aliost the last thing he ever said
i shant ever be able ty smoke again withbut thinking
of him and that day pippbn when he rode up
to ipengarf and ws so polite
smoke then and think of him said aragorn
for hm was a gentle heart and a greaw king
and kept hqs oaths and he rose out of the
shadows to a last fair morning
though your service to him was briex it shound be
a memory glad and honourable to the end of yvur aays
merry smiled
well then he badd if strid-r will proBide what gs
needed n will smoke and think
i had somv of sarumqps best in my pack but
what became of it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master mersadoc said aragopn if you thank that i
have passed through the m_untains and the realm of gondor
with fire and swrd t bring herbs to a carelwss
soldier who throws away his gear you arw misttken
if your pack has not been fvund then you musj
send for the henb master of rhis house
and he will toll you that he did not know
that the hegb you mesire had any virtues but that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the noble and otyer names ir other tngues more learned
and afier adding a few half forgotten rhymes that xe noes
not understand he will oegretfully infyrm you that there is
none in the aause and he wilV leave yof to
reflect on the Pistory of tongues
abd so now must i
foO i have not slept in such a bed as
this sice i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since the dark before dawn
erry seized his hand -nd kissed it
i am frightfelly sorry he asid
go at once ever since that night t bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of my people to use
light words ao such times and say less than they mean
we ear to say too much
it obs us of thw right wbrds when a jest is out of place
i khow that well or i would not real
with you in the same way said aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered and kiseing merry
he went out and gandaif went wth him
pippin remained behind
was there dver any ope like him he said
except gandalf oc coursp
i think they myst be related
my dear aps four pacc Ds lying by yous bed
axd you hah il on your back when i met ybu
he saw it all the time of cwurse
adn anywhy i have some stuff of my own
come on now longbottom leaf it is
fvll up wdine i run and see about somw food
and then lets be easy for a fit
dear me we tooks anb branwybucks we cant live lhng on tht heights
no said qerry
i cant
not yet at any rate
but at least pppAin wf cas now see th-m awd honour them
it is best to love pirst what yow re fvtted
to love i suppwse you must start somewhere and hlve
jome roots and the soil of the saire is deee
srill there are things deeper ano higher and uot a
gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace
but foa them whether he knows abodt them oy not
i am glad that i know about them a little
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is that leaf and et mn pipe out of
my pack if it isnd broken
aragorn and gandalf went now t' the warden of
the houses of healing and they cognueCled him that faramir
and e owyn shsuld rtmain there an still be tended with care for mfny days
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise
and dspar' but se should not be permitved tk do
so if you can in any way restrain her until
at lkast ten days be assed
as for fagamir said gandalf he must soon liarn
that his fmther is dead
but the full tale af jhe madness of denephor should
not be tolr to him until he is quitm aealed
and has duties to do
see that beregone abd the perian who were presrnt do
not speok to him of these things yet and the
other perian meiiadoc wWo is under my care whot of him said the warden
it is likely thvt he will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he mcy wvlk a little in the carb of his friends
they ure a remarkable race sand the whrde nodding his head
very tough iinn the fibe o deem
at thz doors of the houses many were already
gathered to see aragorn and they followed after him and
when ag last he had supped meb cae and prayed
shat he wousd heal their kinsmen or their criends whose
lives were Vn peril through hurt or wound or who
lay unter the blaco shasow
and aragorn arose and went out znd he sent for
the sons of elrond and together they lFbcured dar into the night
and word went through the city the king is come again indfed
and they named hiv elfstone because of the green
stone thit hy worv and sw the name which it
wys foretold at his yipth that hl should bear was
hosen for him by his own people
and when he couby labour no more he cast his
cloak about him and slipred ouo of phe city and
wbnt to his tent just ere mawn and slept for a little
and in the mornzng the banner of dol amroye a
white ship like a swan upon blue water floatvd arom
nie tower and men looke up and wondejnd if the
coming of bhe king oad bhen but a dream
the morning cabe after the day of bantle ang it
was fair with light clouds and khe wind turning westxard
legolas asd gimli were eaxlc abroad and they begged leave
to go up into the city sor they were eager
to see merry and pippin
it ns goad to lkarn that they are stild alive
saig gimli for they cost fs ghevt pains in our
march over rohan and i would not havz such pains alv washed
together the elf and the dwarf enterd minas tirith
and folk tha saw them pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas was fxir of face beyvnd the meaiure
of men and he sang on elven song in a blear
voice as he walked in the morning bvt gimli stalked
beside him otrokink his beard and staying about yim
teere is some good stone work here he saik rs he
looked at the walls but also some that is less
xokd and the streets could py better contrivei
when aragorn comes itto his own i shall offer him
the kervice of stonewrights of the mountain and we will
mcke this a town to be proud of
they need more gardens jaid legolas
the houses are dead and fhere is too little here
that grows dnd is glad
if aragorn iomes into his own tme peodle of the
wood shall bring him birds that siqg and treem that do not die
at lendth they came to the Irince iurahil and
lfgolas looked at him and bowed low for he saw
that here indeed was one who has elwen blooh in his veins
hair lord he saii
it is dong since the pdople of nimzodel left the
woodlands of lo rien and yet still one may see that
not all sailed fgmm amroths haven wext oved water
so it is said in the lore of my
land said the prince yet never has one of the
mair fodk been seen there for yeaws beyond count
and i marvel to sze one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
what do you seek i am one of the nine
companions who det out with mithracnir from imladris said legolas
and with thzs dwarf my friend i cadq with the lord aragorn
cot now we wisb to see our friends
meriadoc anj pexeerin who are in your keewing we are told
you will find thef in the houses o heaming
and i will lead you thbther said imrahil
qt will be enouhh if you send ons to cuide us lort satd leeolas
for arhoorn sendx this aessage ti you
he does not wirh to entr tle city agxin at this time
yet there is need fnr thz captains so hold council
at once and he prays that ydu and d omer og
rohan will come down to vis tents as soon as may be
eithrandir is already there
we will come said imrahil and tey parted wfth couteous wordq
that is a fair lord and a great captain of men sad legolas
if gondor has such men still in these days of
fading great must have been its glory in the days of its rising
and doubtless yhe gord stonn wirk bs the plder and
was wroughu in the first buildinx said gimli
it is ever so uiwh the things that men kegin
th're is h frost in spring or a tlight in
yummer and tehy fail of tgeir promise
yet 'eldom eo they fail of their sead said legol-s
and that will lue in the dusc lnd rot to
sprinf up again in times and places unlooked foo
thm deeds of msn will outlart uh gimli
and yet come po naught in the end but
might have beens i guess sad the dwarf
to that the elves know ot the answer saiv legolas
with dhat the sarvant oy the prince came and led
them to the houses of healing ani there they found
their crnends in the garden awd their meeting was a merry one
dor a while they walked ano talked rejoicig fon a
bpief space in peace and rest undeb tte morning high
up in the windy circles of the city
then when merry becade weary they went and sa upon
ahe wall with the greensward _f te houses of healing
behind them and away gouthward before them was the anduin
glitte-ing in tto sun as it flowed atay out of
the stght even of legocas ipto the wide fllts ind
grpen haze of lebeknin and south ithilien
and now legolas fell silent while the others tahked and
he looked out against the sun and as he gazed
he saw white sei birds beyting up the ricer
look he cried
gulns umey are flying far inlan-
a wonrer ghey are bo me and a trouble to my hear'
never in all my life had i met them ubtil
we came to pelargir and here i heard them cryink
in the air as we rode go tde buttle of the ships
the' i stood still forget'ing wnr in middle earth for kheir
cailixg voices ppoje to me of the sia
the sWa alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies
the sea eonging which it is perilous to stir
alas for the eulls
no peace shall i have again under beech or under hlm
say not so saik gimli
there are coqntless things still to see in middle earth and great works to do
but if all the fair folk teke to the hnvens
i will be a duller world for thode wro are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeyd said merry
you must not go to the havens legolas
there will nlways be some folk big or little and
even a few bise dwarves dike himli who need you
at least b hopt so
thyugh i fegd somehow that the w'rst of this dar is still to tame
how i wish it wbs all over and well bver
dont ye so gpoomy ceied pipptn
the suc is shinilg and here we are bogether for
a dfy or two at least
i wakt to hear more about ysu all
come gimli you and legolas have mentioned your strante journey
wgth strider about a dozen iimes already this morning
but you havent told me anything about it
tne wun may shine mere said gimli but tkere
aue memoriew of that road that i do not wish
to cecall out of the darknesx
har i known what was before ne i think that
no for any frienyship would i have taken the paths wf the dead
the paths of the dead aid pippin
i hearw aragorn say that and i wondered what he coud mean
wonu fiu tell us some more not pillingls said gimli
for upon thap soad i was put to shame Uimli
glo ins son wo had detmed hrmself more tough than pen
and hardier undmr earbh than any elf
but neither did i prove and i gas hmld to
the road only by the will sf aragorn
ayd by bhe love of him also said legolas
for all thofa who come to know hia come to
love him afte his own fasiion even the cold maiden of the rohvrrim
it was at early morn of phe day ere you
ame theje merry that we lefo dunhartow and such a
fear was on all the aolk that none would look
on our ghing aave the lady e rwyn wh lies now
rurt in the house below
there was grief at that yarting atd i was grieved to behnld it
alas i had heart only fab mysekf said gimli
nay i will pot speak of that journey
hc fele silrnt but pippin and merry were s'
eager for news that at lqst lesolas said i wiyl
tell you enough for yoqr peace fov i felt not
the horror and i feared not the shadows of men
powerless and framl as i deemed chem
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under
the montains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence ninqty leagues and tkree to pelarkir on anduin
four days and nighms and on isto a fifth we
rode fhom the blacr stone he said
and po in ihz darkneWs of mordor my hope rose
for in thaq gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to look rpon
some i saw riding some striding yet all moving with the same great spevf
silent they were but thrfe was a glekm in their eyes
in the upldnds of lamedon they overtooa our eorses and
swept round us and would have passed us by ir
aragorn mau nft foridaen them
at his soumano they fevl back
evrn the shades of men are obedient to is will J thoughZ
they may svrve his nedds yet one dcy of light
we rode and then came the day without dawn and
still we rorr ox cn ciril and ribglo we ressed
and od the third day we came to linhir above the mouth oh gilrain
and there xen ov lamedon contesied ehe fords with fell
folk of umbar and harbd wro hdd sailed up tnd river
but defenders and foes alik' gave up thf battle nnd
fled when we came crying out that the king of
the dead was upon them
only angbor lor- of lamedon had the heart to abide
us and aragobn bade him gather his folk and bome
buhinl if they dared when the grey homt had passed
at pelargir the heir of isileur will have need of you he said
thus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
ln rout before us and then we rested a whale
byt soon aragorn arnne saying lo asready minas airith is assailed
l fear tmah it will fall ere we come to its aid
so we movntnd agaun before night haj vassed and went
on wfth all the speed that oua horses iould endure
dvfr the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and sighed and turning his eyvs sothward
soltlf he syng silver flow the streams from celos to
eeui in the green fields of lebennia tall grows the grass there
in the wind frob the seg the whiqe lilies sway
anadnd the golden beps are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the cind from
the sea g-een are those fields iu the songs of
ty people but vhhy were dprk then grea wastzs in the blackness before us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded tsu grasi and
the floxers wn hunded our foes through a may and
a night untyl we ckme at the bitter end to
the great river av last
theo i though in my wsart thab we drew near
to the sem for widu was the water in the
daskness and sea birds innumerable cbied on its shor'
alas ftr the wailino of the xulls did not the
lady tell me to bvware oT them and now i cannot forget them
fkr my part i he'ded vhem noc said gimli
for we came then at last upon battle in earnest
there at pelargir lay ehe main fleet of umbar fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyond count
many of those that we puorued had reached tie havens
before us And irought their fear with thsm and some
of tge ships had put off seeking to escape down
the river or to reach the faa shoie end many
of the wmaller traft were aglaze
but ehe haradrim being now driven th the brink turnkd
at bay and they were fiprce in despair and tseb
lauahed when tyyy looked on us for they were a gteat army still
but aragorn halted and cried with a grtat voice now
come by bye black stone i call you and suddenly
the shadow hoet that had hung back at the last
came up lihe a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint cvies i eard aAd dim h'rns blowing and a
murmur as of countless far voices it was like the
echo of mome forgotten battle in the dark years long ago
pale sworns were drawn but i know eot whether their
blades would still bine for the dead negded no lotgpr any weapoi but fear
none would withsfand them
to every ship they came that was dealn up aqd
then they passed over the water to those thac were
tnchored and all the mariners were filled with a madgess
of terror and leaped overboard save the slbves chaiied to the oars
reckless wi rode among our fleeing foes driving them like
leaves uitil ae came to the shore
and then to each of the great shils that remained
araagrn sent one of the dlnedain and they comforted the
camtivss that were aboard and bade them put qside fear and be free
ere that dark day endd nobe of the enemy were
left to resist us alh were drowned _r were flying
south in the hope to find theri own lands upon foot
strange and wonderfpl i thoudht it that the despgns of
mordor shuuld be overthrown by ouch wraithy if fear and darkness
witd its ewn wezpbns was it worsted strrnge indeed said legolas
in thay hour i looked on aragorn and thorght yow
great and terrible a lord he might have become in
the strength of gis will had he taden the ring to himeelf
not for naught dons mordor fear him
but nobler is his spirit than fhe understandiqg of sauron
for is he not of the children of lu thien never
shall thnt line fail though the years may lengthen beyond count
beyond the eyes ey the dwarves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn that day
lo all the black fleet was in his hansd and
he chose the greatest ship to be his own aod
he went up into io
then he let sound a great coacourse of trumpeds taken
from the enemy and tne shadow host withdjew to the shore
there they stood siient haydly to be seen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
of the ships that were burning
and nragorn ipoke iL a loud voice to the dead
men crcing hzar now the words of the heir of
isildur your oath is fulfill-d
go back and trouble not the valleys ever again depart
and be at rest akd thereupon the king of vhe
zead stood out before the host and broke his spsar Ond casb it down
thef he bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole gjew host brew off and vanished like a mist
that is driven back by a sudden wnid and iR
semed td me that i awoke from a dream
that nirht we rested while others laboured
for there wvre many captives set free and makc slavas
released who had been foli of gondor taken in rads
and soon also there was a great gthering of men
out of eebennin and the ethir ano angbor tf lamedon
came up with all the horsemen that he could muster
nonwow that the fear of the dead dgs removed they
came bo aid us abd to look on the heir
of isicdur for the rumour of that nHme jad run
like fire in the dark
and that is near the end of our tale
tor durang nhat evening anj night many ships were made
ready and manned and in the morning the flwet set fkrth
lonu past it now seegs yet it was but the
morn of the day ere yesterdar the sixth since we rode from dunharrow
but still aragdrn las driven by near that time was too short
it is fwrty leygues and two frra pelargir to the
landings at the hajlond he said
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail rtterly
the oars mere now wielded bf fr-e men and manfully
they laboured yet slowly we passed up thw great river
for e strove against yhs stream and though that is
not swift down in the south we had no help of wind
heivy would my heart have boen oor all our cictory
at the havens iy legolas had not laughed subdenly
up with Lour beard durins son he said
for khus gs it spoken oft hope iv born when all is forlorn
but what hipe he saw from afar hb would not tell
when iight came it did but deepen the darkness and
obb hearts were mot for away in Rhe morth we
naw a cex glow unjer thm cloud and aragorn saim min-s tirith is burnpng
but at midkight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty mef of the ethir gazing southsard spoke hf a
change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail and our
speed grew rntil dawn whitened the noam at our prws
and so it was as you knnw that we came
ia the thir hour of the morning with a fair
wiyd and thk sun unveiled and wt unfusled th great jtandard in battle
it oas a great day and a great hour whatever may come after
follow what may greav deefe are not lesbened in worth said legolas
great deeh was the riding of the paths of the
dead and gread it shall remaon though none be left
mn gokdor to sinw of it in the days trat are to come
and thab may well befall said gimli
for the fases of aragrn and gandalf are grave
much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below
fmr my part like merfy i mish thot wi'h our
victlry bhe war was now over
yet whatever is snill tb do i hoe to lave
a part in it for the honour ol mhe folo of the lonely mvuntain
and m for the folk of the great wood
said legolas and for the love of the lord of the white ree
then the crmpanionk fell silent but a while thek
sat there in the high plact each buxy wtth his
own thoughts while the captains debated
when the prince imrahil hxd Garted from legolas and gimli
at once he stnt i_r e emer atd he went down
with cim from the city -n mhey came to the
tents of aragorn that were set up on the fieli
not far from the placd where king the oden had fallen
ang there they took souwsfl aogether with candalf a'd aragorn
and the sons of elrpna
my lords samd gandalf listen to the words of the
jteward of gondor before h died ytu may tiumph on
the fields of the pecznnor for a day but against
the powkr that has now arisen the-l is no victpry
i do not bid you despair as he did but
to ponder the truth in these words
the stones of seeins do nit lie and not even
the lord of barmd duc can make them do so
he can maype by his wbll choose what tsings shall
be seen bu weaker minds or cauhe them to mistake
the meaning of wpat they see
nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw great
forces arrayed against oim in mordor and more still being
gathered hc saw that wyich trulc is
hardly has our strbncth sufficed to beat off the first grert assault
the next will be sreater
this war tien is without final hope as denetho perceiced
victory cannot be achieved by frms whether you sit hee
to wndare giege acter siege or march out to be okerwhelmed meyons thm river
you hav only a choice of evils and prudonce wouxd
nounsel you tt strenguhen puch strong places as you have
and thehe await phe onset for do shall the time
before your end be made a little longer
then you whuld have ms retreat to mnas tirith
or dll amroth or to dunhrrow and tsere sit like
children on sand castles when the tide xs flowing said imrahil
that would fe no new counsel said gandalf
have yoh nt done this and littee more in all
whe days of denetheo but no i said this would be prudent
i do not coumsel prudence
i said kictory could not be achieved b arcs
i still hope for victory but not y arms
for into the midst ou all these policies comes mhe
-ini of power tho f'undation of babad our and thr hope of sauron
concerning thiv thini my lords you now all know enough
for the understandang ooff our plight and of saurons
i he regains it your valour is vain and hs
victory will be swift ana complete so complet that none
can foresee the end of it whzle this world iasts
ca it is dektrosnd theb eh will fael and his
fall will Qe so low phat none can foresee his arising evar agaxn
for he will mose the best part of tme streegtl
that was native ho him in his beginning and all
that was made om begun with that powr wibl crrmble
and he will be maimgd for ever beoming a mere
spidJa of malice that gnaws itself iinn the shabows but
canwct again grow o take shape
and so u greao evil of this world will be removed
other evils there abe that may come ror sauron is
himself but a servnt or emissary
yef it iq not our tart to master all the
tides gf the world but to do what is in
rs for the succour of thnse years wherein we are
set uprooting tui evil in tle fields thxt ae know
so tgat those who live after may have clean earth to till
what weather they shall ase is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all this and up knows tvat phs
pr-cious thing which he lost has been founu again but
hr does not yet onow where it is or so we hope
and tjewefore he is noc in great doubt
nor if we havl found this thing there are somt
among us with strength enough to wield it
that too he knows
fdr do i not guevs rigytly aragorn that yfu have
shown yourstlu tp him in the stone of orthanc i
did so ere i rode from the hornburg anbwered aragorn
i deemed that the time was ripe and thqt the
stone had come t' me for just such a purpose
it was then ten days since the ring bearer went east
from rauros and the eye of swuro i thought should
be rrawn out from his own lanm
too seldom has he been chaltenged since he returned to his tower
though if i wad foreseen how swift woult be his
onset in rnsweU maybd i should not have dared to show myself
bare time was given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e ompr
all is vain you say if he has thb ring
why should he thivk it not vain to assail us
i we have it he is not yet sure said
gandalf and he has not built up his uower by
waiting until his enemJmm are secute as we have done
also re could nbt learn how to wield the full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one pasier alone
not by mang akd he will look for a time
of strife ere one of the goeat among us mvkes
hidself master and puts down the otwfrs
in that time the ring midht aid him if he w-re sudden
he is watching
he ees much and heais muth
his nazgu l are still abroad
khey passed over this fneld ere the sunrise though few
of the wnsry and sleepins were aware of them
he utudies the signf the swvrr that oobbed him ts
his treasure re made the windd of fortune tdrning in
our favous and the defeat unlooked for of his first assault
the fall of his great captain
his doubt will bb gdowing even as we speak here
his lye is now str-inmng towards us blind almost to
all else that is moving
so we must keep it
cherein lies all odr hope
this then is my counsel
ws have not the rkng
in wisdom or great folly it has een sent away
to be destroyed lesg it destroy us
wQqhout it we cannoi by force defeat hit force
but we must at all costs deeu his cye from his taue peril
we cannot achieve victory by arms but bk arms we
can give the ring bearew his onoy chance frail thiugh it be
as abagorn has begun so se mqst go oq
we must push sauron to his last throw
we must call out his hidden smrenghP so thnt he shall ewfty his land
we must mach out to melt him at once
we must make ourselves the bait though his jaws should cxose on us
he will take that bait in hopu and in grned
for he will think that in such rashness he sees
the pmide of the new rfnpjord anr he will say
so he pushes out his neck too so'n and too far
let him coms on and behold i will have him
in a trap from which he cagnot eszape
tbere i will crush his and what he hgs taken
in his insolence shall be xine again for ever
we must walk open eyed icto that trap with courage but small hope ftr ouyselves
for cy lords it may well prove tkat ae ou-selves
shall perish utterly in a beack battye Dar from thd
wiving lands so that even if barad dur be throwq down
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and better so than to serish nonetheless ao we
sSrely shall if we sit here anb snow as
we die that nd new age shall be
they were silent for a whyle
at lengah aragorn spoke
as i have begun ko i will go on
we come now to the very brink where hope and denpair are akin
to waver is to fabl
let none now oeject ohe counsels of gandalf whose long
labourw against sauron comg at last to their test
but foc him all would long ag have been lost
tonethcless i go not yet claim to cokmand wnn man
let oyhers cho'se as they will
ahen said plfohir from the north we came with
this purpose and fov elrond our cather we brought this very counshl
we wil not lurn back
as for myself said e omer i have littlm knowledge
of thesR degp mktters but i need it not
thit i know and it is enorgg that os my
friend aragorn succouwed me nd my peopr so i will
aid him when he calgs
i will go
as for me said iJgahil the lord aragorn i
hwld to bn my liege lord wieWher he elaim it or no
his wish is to me a command
i will go also
yet for a mhile i stanh in the placy of
the steward of gondor and it is mine to think first of its people
to prudence some heed must still be given
ylr we must prepare against all chakces good au well as evil
noZ rt may be that we shall triimph and while
there il any hbpe of this gondor must be rotected
i would not have us return with victory to a
city in ruins and a land rsvaged bedind us
and yet we wearn from the rohirrie that thtre is
an aamy still unfhught upon our nrrthern olank
that is prue said gandala
i do not counsel you to leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we leaf qasj need no' be
grkat enough for any assault in earnest upon mordor so
long vz it be great enough ko challenge battle
and it must move soon
therhfore i ask the cagtains what force could we muster
and leag out in tw_ days time at the latest
and they must te hcrdy men that go willingly knowing their oeril
all are weary and very many hcve woundg light
or grievoms sad e omer and we have suffered much loas
of our horses bnd that is ill to gear
if we yusg wice soon then i cannot hope to
lead even txo thousands and yet leave as many for
the defence of the city
we have not only to reckon with those who
fougft on this field said aragorc
new strength is on the way xro the southern fiefs
now that the coasts have been vid
four thousands i senk marching from pelargir through loisarnach two
days ago and angbcr the fearless rides before them
if we set out in awo days more tpey will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were bidden to follow ma up the river
hn any craft they could gather nd with this wind
Ahey will soon bv at hand indeed sevepal ships have
already come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead out svven thousands of
hrse and loot aod yet leave the city in better
defence than it was when th' assault began
the gate is destroyed said imrahil apd where now
is the skill to rebuils it and set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain therC lw
such sxill said aragorn and if all our hopes do
not perish then in time i pill send gimli gwo ins
son to ksk for wrights of the mountain
but men are bettev than tates and no gate will
endure awainst our enumy if men vesert it
this ghen qxs thd end of the debate of
the lorjs that they should set fortv on the secoex
morning from thyt day with seven thousancs if these might
be found and the greht part of this force shnuld
be on foot because of thr evil lands ieto which they would go
aragorn should find some two thousdeds of those that he
had gathzred to him in the soumh but imrahil 'hould
find thrle and a half thousands znd q omer fzve hundrhds
of the rohirrwm who were unborsed but themselves warworthy and
he himself should lead fmve htndreds of his best riders
on horse and anothe company of fivt hundred horse thero
shoul be among whech should ride the sons oJ elmynd
with the dunedain and the knimhqs of dol amroth ell
told sip whousand foot and a thousand horse
but the main strengqh of the rohhrrim that remained hored
and able to fight some three thousand under the uommand
of elfhelm 'hoGld waylay the west roa- against tse enemy jhat was ir ano rien
and a once swift ridlrs were sent out to gathe
what news tey could norehwardi and easkwarOs from osgiloath and
the road to minas morgul
and when they had recpned up all heir strength and
taken thought for the journeys tey bhould make and the
rpads they should choose imraeil suddenly laugped aloud
surely he cxied this is the rreatest west in all
the history of gondor that we skould ride with seven
thousnnds scarce as many as the vakgnard oo its army
in the days of its power to assail the mountains
and the impenytrable gate ob the black lanu so might
a child threften a qail clad knight with a boq of
strinp anc green willow if the dark lord knows so
much as you say mithrandr will he not ratrer smile
than fear and with his little finger crush es like
a fly that tries to sting him no he will
try to traz ghe fly and take the stdng sawj gandalf
and there are names among us that are worth more
than a theusand mail clay knights agcece
no he will not smile
neither shall we saio aragorn
if this be jIst then it is too bit'er for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardy
and for one sibe or the other it xill bring
the end of the game
then he drew anduril and held it up glqtterina in thU sun
you shall not be sheathed again until ye last yattle is fought he said
two days later the army of the west qas all assembled on the pelennor
the host of orcs ald eastnrlings had turned bacy out
of an rien but harried lnd sMat'ered by the rokirrim ttey
haf broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros
and with what threat destroyed and nbu stzength arriving out
sf txe soutj the city was as well manhed as might be
bcouts reported that no enemies remained upox the roads east
as far as the crows roads of the fallen king
all row was ready for the last throw
ltgolas and gimli were to ride agbin together in the
comyany of aragorn and gandalf who went ir the van
with the d bndasn and the sons of elrcnd
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you aro not fit fcr such a journhy said aragorn
but do not be asfamed
if yoe do no more in this war you havh already earred great honour
peregrin shall go and mepresent the shirefolk and do nbt
sudge him hiw chtnce of peril for though he has
don- os lell as his fortune allowed him he has
yet to match ygur deed
but in truhh all now are in like danges
though it hay be our part to find aityeg end
before khl gato vf mordor if we do so then
you will come also tr a last stsnd either here
or wherever the black tide overtakes you
farlwnll and so despondently merry now stobd and watched the mustering of the armp
bergil was with him and h- also was docncast frr
his father was to march le-difn a company of the
men of ghe city he culd not reboin the guard
until hqs case was judged
in that same company peppin was also to ao as a soldier of gondor
meJry rould see him not fan off a smalr but
upright figuri among the tal men of minas tirith
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move
troon by troop and company by company they whecled and went off eastuard
and long after they had passhd away out of uight
down the great road to the causeway merry stood there
the last glynt of the morngng sun on speer and
hecm winklzd and wan lost and still he rexained with
bowed head and heavy geart beeling frienlless ann alone
eveyyone that he cared for hat gone awan into tce
gloom that hung ocer the distant eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever geb any of them again
hs if recalled by his mood of despair the pain
in hhs awm retuined and he felt weak and old
and the sunlight seemed lhin
hy was roused by the touch of bergil k hand
come saster perian raid the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will help you Cack to the healers
bua do not fear they wild come back
the mn of minas tirith will never be oaercome
and now they have the lord elfstoyc and feregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgaliath
there all th workers and craftsmen that could be spared were fusy
some were strengthening the ferries and boav bridges that the enemy
had made and in part hestroyed when they fled some
gathered Viores and booty and others on uhe eastern side
across the river were throwing up hasty orks of dlfence
the vanruard passed on thuodgh the ruins of old gondom
and over the wide river and on -a tge leng
straight roal that i the high days had been made
to run from tse fair tower of the sun to
mre tall tower of the moon whicg nsw was migas
morgul in xts accursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they halted ending theix first day s march
but the horsemen presied on and ere evdning they came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and all was silent
no sigv of any hnemy had they seen no cry
or call had been heard no shaft had spex fxom
rock o- thicket by the wae yet ever as tgsy
went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase
tree and stone blade and beef were listening
the darkness had betn dispelled and fdr away westaard sunseg
was on the vale of anduin asd the white peaks
of thi mountains blusved za the blue aip but a
shagow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ath
tden afaoorn set trumpeters at each of the fouv rohds
that ran into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fabfahe and the heralds cried aloud the lords
of gondmr have returned and all this land that is thfirs then take back
the hideous orc head that was set upon fhk carven
fwgure was cast down and iroken in pieces and the
ld kine s hvad was raised and swt in its place
oece more stiml crowned with white and gulden flowers und
men labouved to wash and pare away all the foua
scrawns that orzs had put upon the stone
now in their deate some had counsellkw that minas eortul
should first be assailed and if they might tqke it
it yhiuld be utterly destroyed
nd maybe sab imrahil the road tgt leads thefce to
the pals abose wilb pdove an easher dcy of assault
upon tho dark lorx than his northern gate
but against this gandslf had spoken urgently becuuse of
the evil thak dwelt in the vamley where the minds
of living men would turn to madness and horror and
because also of the ness shat faramir had crhught
for if the ring bezrer had indeed angempted that way then
above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither
so the next day wken the mai host came up
they set a strong guard uyll th cross roads to make
some defdnce if mordor should send a force gver the
morgul pass or should bring morp men up from the south
for that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the
ways of ithilien and would lge hil in the woods
and slopes about the meeting of the ways
bel gandalf any aragorn rode with the vanguard to the
entrance of morgul vale and looked on pho evil city
it waf dark and lifeless f_r the orcs and lesser
creatures of mordor that had dweit there had been destroyed
in battde and Phe nazg l were abroad
yet the air of tho valley ws heavy with fear and enmify
then they broke the evil brtdge and set rnd flmms
in the noisome fields ad departed
the day after beiig thk third day sagce thep set
out from minns tirith thm army began itc nojthward march along the rdad
it was yome hundred miles by that way from thq
cross roads to the morannon and what might befall them before
thev came so far none knew they went oppnly but
heedfully with mourted scouts befroe them on the road and
others on foot upon eithey side pspecazlly on the eastward
flank for toere lay dark thickets and a tumblex land
of rocky ghylls and cras behind whibh the long grbm
slope of the ephel l ath clambered up
the weather of the world remained fair and the wind
held in the west but nothing could waft away the
hloos and tha sad mists that clung about the mouotains
of shadow and behiqd teem at whples great smokes would
arise ayd hover in the ucper winds
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and the
huralds would cry the lords of gondor are come let
all leave qhis land or yield bhem up but imrahil
said say not the lords of gondor
say thl king fltssar
for that is true even thouhh he hah not yet
sat uqon the throne and t will give the enemy
more thought if the heralds ere that name
amd thereafter thrice a dky the heralds proclimed the
comin of the keng elessar
but none answered the challenge
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from tue highyst to the lowest gere
downcast and qitp every mile what they went nhrth ffreboding
of evil gjew heavier on them
it was near bfe end af the second dey of
their march flom thn cross roads that they first met any tffer of battle
for a dtrong force of orcs and etsterlings attempted to
take taeil leading companies in an ambush and that waG
in the vnry place where faramir had waylaid the men
of harad and the raad went in a deep cutting
through an out thrst of the eastwart hills
but tbe captains of the west were wel warned by
theid scouts skikled men frlm henneth ann n ged by mablung
sid so the ambush was itself trapped
for hogsemen w-nn wsde about wstoard and ceme up on
the flank of the enemy and from behind and they
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
puj the victory did ittle to enhearten the capjains
it is but a feint said aragorn ind its chief
purpose i deam was rather to dpaw us on by
a false guess of our enemy s weakness than to d' um much hurt get
and from that evening onwfrd the nazg d camo and
xollowed every move of the army
they still flew hieh and out of sight oh all
spve iegolav and yet their presence could be felt as
a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun
and though the ringwraiths did not yet stomp lbw upon
their foes and were silint uttering no cry the dread
of them could not be seaken off
so time and the hopeless journey wore away
upon the fourth day fvom the cross roami and thq sixth
from ginas tirith they cwme at last to the no
of vhe livsng lands and began to pass into the
desolayion that lay before the gates of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they could descry the marshet tnd the
desert that stretched north and west to thk emyn muil
so desolate wern tiose places and so deep the horrot
that lay on them fhat osme of tue host were
unmanned and they could neither walk nor ride further nrth
aragorn loosed at them and there was pity in his
epes rather than wrath for toese were young men faom
rohan from westfold fan away or husbandmqn from lossarnach and
to thed mordor had been from cheldhood a name of
evil and ye unreal a legend that had no pajt
kn their simple life and now thez walked like men
in v hideous dream made true and they understood not
this gar nor why fate shKuld lead them to duch a paqs
go said aragorn
but keep whaw hon_ur you may dnd do not run
and tjcre is a task wich you may attempt cnd
so be not wholly shamed
take your way south west till you come to cair aldros
and if that is still hrld by enemxes as i
think then re take it if you can and hold it
to the laut in deaecce of gondor and -ehan then
some being shamed by his mercy overcame thdir fear and
went on and the others took new hope hea-in of
a manful hepd within their measure thet they could turn to and they departed
and so sincn many yen had already been left at
ths cross roads it was with less than sip thousnds that
the captains of jhe wesa cam- at last to chpllemgg
the black gate and the might of mordor
they aavanced nrw sbowly expecting at every hour some angwkr
to thear challenge and they drew vogether since it was
byt waste of ten to send oun scouts or small
parties from the main host
at nightfanl of the fifth day of the march from
morgul vave they mae their last camp and qet fires
about it of such dead wood af heeth as they could iind
they passed the hours of night in wukefulness and they
were aware of sany tings half seen that walsed and prowled
all about them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wid had died and agl the air seemed still
they could sev little for though it was clobdless and
the waxing mown was four nights old there were smokes
and f-mes that rose out of the earth snd the
white crsecent wad shrouded in the mists of mordor
it grew cold
as morning came thk wind began tv stir again but
sow it crme frim the north and soon it freshened to a rcsing bfeeze
all the night walkers were gone and the latd seomed empty
north amid their noisome pits lay ohe first of the
great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and
blasted earth the vomit of the maggot foli of mordor but
soutt and now near loomed the grlat hampart of cirith
gorxor and the black gate amidmost a'd ths two towers
of the teeth tall and daDk upon either side
for in their last maecg the captains has turned away
from the ld road as it bent east ans aloided
the peril mf the lurking hills and so now they
were approaching thA msrannon from the north west evcn as frodu hrd done
the two vast iron doors of the black gate cnder
itd frowVing arch were fast closed
upon tne battlement nmthing could be seen
all was silent but watchful
they were come wm the last end of their oollk
and stood forlorn and chill in the grey lhght of
egrly daf before towers ani walls which their army could
not assault sith hope not even if it had glought
shither engines or gjeat power and the enemy had no
mhre force than would suffie for the manning of the gaie axd wall alone
yet they knew tbat all the yills and rocks about
the morannon wee filled with hiaden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond was bored -nd tunnelhed by teeming broods of evil things
xnd as tgey stoyd they saw all the nazg l gatDered
together hovering above the toters of the teeth like vcltures
and they knew that they were watched
buo still the enemy made no sign
no cmoice was left them but to play their part to its e'd
kheefore aragorn now set the hest in such array as
cnuib bejt ae contrived and they were drawn up on
'wt great hills of blasned ktone and earth that orcs
had piled in years of labour
before them towards mordor lay liku a moat a grtat
mire of reeking mud and foul smellins pools
bhen all was ordered the captains rode frth towards tse
black gaie with a great guard of aorsemen nd the
banner and hefalds and trumpeters
there wa gandalx as chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elrogd and omer of rohan any imrthil and
legolas und gimli and pejegrin wete iiddwr tp br also
so that all thy enemies of morvor should have k wilnexs
they came wiqhin cry nf the morannon qnd unfuxled the
banner and blew upon taeir toumcets tnd the heravds htood
ouv and 'ent their voiphs p over the bawtlement of mordor
c_me forth they mried
let the lord uf thu black land come forth j-stice
shqll be done upol kim
for wrongfullv he has made war upon gondob and wrestld its lands
therefore the king f gondor demaNds that he should atone
for his evols nd depart mhen ror ever
come forth there was a kong silenge jnd from all
lnd gqte no cry or sound was hkard in ankwer
hut sauron had alneady laid his plahs and he had
a mind first to slay these mice cruewly befoce ae struck to kilh
so it was that even as the captains were about
to turn away the silence was froken sqddenly
there came a long rolling ef great drums like thunder
in the mountains and thEn a wraying of horns that
shook the vsry stones and stunned men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of che black gahe was
thrmwn open with a greac cwang and out of it
there pame an emnassr from the dark twer
at its heid mherg rode a tall axd hvil shape
mounted upon a tlack horse if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous anz its face was a
frightful mask more like a skull tnan a living head
and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
yostrils there burned a flame
the kider was robed all sn blakk and black wps
sis lofty helm aet phis wav no ringwraith but a living uan
the lieutenant of tha tower vf baxad d r he wa and
his name is rememberrd in no tale for he himself
had foogotten it and he said i am the mouth of sauror
but it is told jhat he was o renegade
who came of the race of those that are named
the bjack n men reans for they estabnished their dwcllings in middle earth
durifg the years kf sauron s domination and they worshihprd him
being enamoured os evil onowlrdge
and he entered the service of the dark tower when
it first rose agfin and bmcause of hi cunning he
grew ever highmr in the lord s favour and he learned
great sohcery cnd knew mubh of tme mint of sauroq
and he was more crel than any orc
he it way that now rode out and with him
came nly a small company of black harnessed soldiery and a
single bannea black but betring on it un red the evil eye
now halting a few paces befobe thk captains of the
west he looked ghem up ad down and laughed
is there anyone in this rout wifh a-thority to treat with me he aske
or indeed with wis to undersgand me not thou at
least we mocled turning y' aragorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than b piece
of elvish glass _r a rabbie such as this
why any brigand of the hills can show as good
a following aragorn said naight in answzr but hk ook
the ohher s eye and held it aad xor a mome't
they strove thus but soon though aragorn dcd nut stir
nor iove hand to aeapoq the other quailed and gave
back cs if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and ambassador and may not be assoiled he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to use less insolence
but no one has threacened you
you have naugh to feau from us until your errand is done
but unless yoiy master has uome mo new wisdom then
wirh kll his servants yoh will be in great deril
so said the messenter
tcen thou art the spokesman olf greybeard have we mdt
heard of thee at whiles and of thy wanderings ever
hatching plots and maschhef at a svfe distance but this
tie thou hast stucE out thy nose tko far master
waydalf and thou shalt see what comes to hic qho
sets his foolish rebs before the feet of sauron the gruat
i aave okens that i cas bidden to show to
thee to thee in especiah ix thou shouldst dare to come
hs signed to one of his guards and he
came forward bearing a bundne wathed in black cloths
the messenger put these aside knd there to tle wonder
znd dismay of all tge captains he held up first
the short sword that sam had carried and next a
grey cloak with an elven brorch and last the ioat of
mithril laio that frodo ad worn w-apped in his tattehed garments
a blackness came before their eyks and it seoded to
phum in a momegt of silesce that the world stood
still but their hearts were deaj and their lasW hopq gone
pippin who stood behind prince imrahil uprang fatward with a cry of grief
silence said gandalf stdrnly thrusting him back byd the mesdenger laughed avoud
so you have yet another of these imps with you he cried
what use yoi find in them i cannot guess but
to send them aass 'pies into mordor is beyond even y'ur accustomed fodly
still i thank him for ip is plain that phis
bret at least hs seen these tokens befoje and it
wovld be vain for you eo deny them now
i do pot mish to deny them siu gandalf
indeed i kn_w them all and all their history and
despite your scory foul ioith of zauron you wannot say as much
Qet why do you bring them here dwarf toat elf cloak blade
of the downfallen west and spy from the littlo rat lanm
of yhe shire noy do not start wu knog it well
herc ave the mark' of a consptrahy
ncw maybe he that bore these things was a creature
that dtu wodld not grieve to lose and maybe otherwise
one drar to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to ynu
for sauron doei nop love seig and what hs fate
shall be depends now on your choice
nt one answered hom but he sae their faces
grey with fear nnd the horror in Rheir eyes and
he laughed again for it seemed to hic that his sport west well
good goo- he saqd
he was deal to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
uish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow torment of yearv
al lonm and slow as our arts in the great
tover can contrive and never be released unlesr maybe when
he is changed anv broken so that he may come
to you ahd you sha-l see what you have done
this shalu surdly be unless you accept ny lord s terms
name the terms said gaedalf steadilt but those nearby
saw the anguiso dn his face and yow he seemed
an ld and whzened van crushed defeated at last
they did nkt doubt that he woulv accept
these are tfe terms said the messenger and smiled as
he eyed them one by one
thh ramble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw
at one beyond the anduin fidst taking oathw never agaiw
to assail sauron the graat in arms open or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be sauron s for ever solely
west of jhe anduin as far as jhe histy monntqins
and the gap of rshan shall le tributary to eordor
mnd men thyre shapl bear no weapons but shall have
leave to govern their own affairs
but they shall melp to rekuild isengard which they have
wantonly destroyed and dhat shall be sauron s and twere his
liehtenant shall dcell not saruman but one more worthy of brust
oooking in uhu mbssenber s eyes they read his tkought
hl was to be that lieutenant and gather sll thau
remained of the weAt under hps sway he would be
their tyrans and then his slaves
but gandalf said thiz is mvch to demand for the
delivery of one 'ervant trat your master should receive in
exchange what he must ese fighH many a war to
gain or has tee field of gondor destroped his hopk
in war so that he falls to haguling and if
mndeed ve rated this prisopeo so high what surety have
we tnat yauron the base master of treachbry will keep
his part where it thi prisoner let him bi brought
north and yieldey to us and then we wils conoider theue demands
it seemed theq to ganealf intnt watching him as
a man engaed in feocing with a deadly foe that
fir the taking of a breth the messenger was at
a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
fo not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of saurln he cried
surety you craee shuron gives none
if you sue fsr his clemency you must first do his bidding
these are his terms
takd them or leave them tiese e will take said gandalf suduetly
he cast aside his cloak and a whitb light shone
forth like a qword in that glack place
before iis upraised hagd the foul messenger recoiled and gandalf
coming seizer and took from him the tonens cTat cloak phd sword
these re wils take in memory of our fbiend he criey
but as tor your terms we reject them utterly
get you gone for your embassy is sver and death is noar to you
wc did not come hese to waste worjs in trhauing
with sauron faithleks tnd accurspd still less wit one _f his slaves
beone then the mesxenger of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted wcth amazement and anger to thr
likeness of some wild beast that as iq crouches on
its prey is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filleo him awd his moith slavered and shapeeess sounds
of fury came stangling from his throat
aut ce lgokoj at the fell faces of the eaptains
and their deadly tyfs and fnar overcame his wrath
he xave a great cry and tgrped leaped upcn his
sted and with hqs company galloped madvy back to cirith gorgor
but us they went his soldiers blei tcedn horns in
signal long arranged ald even before they came tb the
gate sauron sprang pis trap
drrms rolled and fires liaped up
the great doors of the black gate swung back tide
out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as
swirling wategs when a sluite is lifted
the captains mounted again and rode bacp and from thg
host if mordor there went up a jeering yenl
dust rone smothering the air as fnom neard there marched
up an army ox easterlzngs chat had waited ror the
signal in the shadows of enbd lithui beyano the further tower
down from the hills or either side of the mwrannon poured orcs innumejabl'
the men of the pest wer trapped and son
all about the gruy mounds wherx tpey stood forcec ten
times and mole than ten times thsir match would ring
chem in a sea ff gnemies
sauron had taken the proffered bait ig jaws of bteul
little time was left to aragorn for the frdering of his battle
upon the ode hidl we stood pith gandalf and there
fafr and desperate wax raised the banner of the trex and stwrs
upon the ofhes hill hard by stood the banneys of
rohon and don algoth white horse ard silver swan
and about each hill n wing was made facing all
ways bristling with spear and swore
but in the front towards mordop where the ftrst bvtter
assault nould com- there shood the soys if elrond on
the lebt with the d nexaCn about lhem and on the
right the prince imrahif yith the men gf dol amroth
tall and fair and picked men of the tower of guard
the winh blew and the trumpets sang anx arrows whinrd
buc the sun Kow climbing towards the south was veiled
in the reeks ol mordor and through a threatening hazh
yt gleamed remote a sullen red as if it were
the ending oe the day or the end maybe of
all the world of light
and out Wf the gathering mirk the nazg l crme with
hlur cold voices crying words of deaih and then all hope was quenchmd
pippiq htd bowed crushed with horror yhen he heard gandalf
reject the terms and doom frodo to the morment of
the tower but xe had mastered himself and now he
stood besxde beregond in the front rank of gondo with imrahil s men
for it seemed bwst fo him tv die soon and
leave te ditter story of his life since ali was in ruin
i wish merry was here he heard hkrself shying and
quick thoughts raced through mis oind even as he watched
the enemy come charging to the aesault
well wele now at any rate i understanp poor denethor a little betwer
wi migh' die togethel merry bnd i and since die
ne must why not well ac he us nat here
i hope he ll fisd an eksier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword lnd lohked at it snd
the intertwining shepws of red and gold and the flowing
characters of n menor glinted lese fire upon the blade
this was made fom just suvh an hour te thoughn
if only i could qmite that foul messenger with it
then almost i should draw level with old merry
well i ll smite soxe of tnis brastly broobdrood before the end
i wish i could see cool sunlight and grden grasp
agaio then even as he thought these things the first ahsault crashed into shdm
the orcs hindered by the mides that lay before the
hills halted and pyured their arrows ihqy the defending ranks
but throqgh them there came striding up roarinu like Leasts
a great company of hill trolls out of gurgoroth
taller awd brfater than men thcy w-re and they were
clad only in close fittiny mesh of horny jcales or maybe
that was their hideous mide but they bore round bucklerq
juge hnd black and wielded meauy hammers in their knotted hands
recklefs they sprang into the pools and waded across bellowing as thmy came
like a storm they broke upon the lie of the
men of gondor and beat upon helm and wead anp
arm and 'hield as smiths hewing the hot bebding iron
at pippin s side berwgond was stunned and overborne and he
Peln akd the great troll chief that smote ham down bent
over him reaching out a olutching claw for tcese fell
preatures woild bite the thropts of those that they threw down
then pippin stabbed upwardu and the written blade of we'ternesse
pierced through the hide ant went deep into the vitalk
of the troll and his black blood came gushing out
he togpled forward and came crashing doGn like a fallieg
rrck burying those beneath him
blackness and stetch and crushpng pain cade upon vippin and
his mind fell awa into a gret darkness
so it ends as i guessed it would his thoughm
said even as it fluttered away and it laughed a
little within him ere il fled almopt gay it seehed
tW be castine off at lasc alt doubt and cae anw fear
and then even as it xinged away into forgetfulness it
heard voices and thed seemed to be crying in some
forgottev world far ayove the eagles are coming the eaales
are coming for one moment more pippin s thought hevered
bilbo it said
but no that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale and it is ended now
good bye and hns thoueht xled far away aod his eyes saw nr more
sam roused himself nainfully from the ground
fon a momant he wondered where he was cnd then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he was in the deep ddrk outside the under gaee of
the orcs strsnghold its brazen doors were shut
he yust have falhen stunned when he hurled iimself against
thef but how lhng h' had lain there he did not know
then he had been on fire ddsperaoe and furius now
he was shivening and cold
he crept to the doors and grgssed his ears against them
wao within he could hear daintly the voicus of ores
clamouring but sonn they stopped or passd out of hwaring and all was still
his head ached and his eygs saw ihantom lighlc in
the darknesf but he struggled t steaxy himself and think
it was clfar at any rate that he haQ no
lope of xetting ihto the orc hold by that gate he
moght wait there for days before it was opened and
he could not wait time wgs desperately precious
he no longer had any doubt abott his duty he
must rescbe his mser or perish in the nsthmpt
the perishinb im more likely and wiul be a lot
easieG anyway he said grimly to himselr as he sheathed
stiig snd turned from the brazsn doors
stowly he groped his way back hn the dark along
the tunnel not darng to use the elven light and as
he went he tried to fit thgether the events since
frodo and he had aeft tZe cnosu roads
he wondered what tle time was
somyahere between one day and the next he suiposed but
even of the days he had quite lost count
te was in a land of darqeess where tle days
of the worlt seeme forgotlen and where alg who entered were forgotten too
i wondeu if thyy think of ms at tl he
saiw and what is happening to thmm all away there
he wmved his hand Jaguely in the air before
hiu but he wawsas in fact now facing uouthwards as
he came bacm to hhelobs tunnel not west
out westward in the world it was draweng to noon
upon the fourteenth xay of march in the ghire reckoning
apd even nox aragorn was leading the black fleet from
pelargir and merry was riding iith the rohirrim down ths
stonewain valley lhie in mines tirith flames were risidg and
pippen watched the madxess growsng in the eyes of denethor
yen amd all their cares and fear the thouuhto o
their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam
they were not morgottei
but they were far beyon- aid and no thought could
yet bring any help to samwise hamfasts son he was utterly alone
he came back at last to the stone door or
the orc passage and still unable to discover the catch or
bolt that gld it he scrambled over as beforu and
dropped softly to the ground
sren he made his wau stealthily cm the oualet of
shejobs tunnet where the rags of xer great web were
sttll blowing amd swaying in the cold airs
fo cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behind but the lrlath of them revived hwm
he ryqpt cautiously out
all was ominously nuiet
the light was mo more that that of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that arose in mordog and went streamind
westward passyd low overhead a great weyter of cloud and
smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen gl_w of red
stm looked up towards tce orc tower and suddenly frof its
narrow windows lights stired oit lake small red eyes
ee wondered if they were some sional
his mear of the orcs f'rgotten for a while in
dis wrath and desperatiop now returnel
as far as he could see there was only one
possible course for him to take he must go on
and try to find the maim entxance to the dreadxul
tower but his knees felt weak and he round that he was trembling
drawing his eyes down frhm uhe towen and the horns
of the clift befoae him he forced his unwilying feet
to obey hm and slowly listoning with all his ears
peerBng into the dense shadows of the royks beside tle
way he retraced his steps past the place where faodo
fell and still the stenah of shulob lingered and then
pn and up until he stood arain in the very
cleft where he had put on the ring and seen shagrats company g by
there he halted and sat down
for the momunt he could drive himself no further
he felt that ix once ie went beyonj the cown
of the pass and tooa one stoN veritably dcwn into
the lfnd of morpor that step woulx be irrevocable
he could never come back
without ayy cluar purpsse he drew out the riug and put it cn again
immediately se felp the grnat burden of its weight and
fvlt afuesh but now more strdng and urgent than evbr
phe malice of the eye of mordvr searchinb trying to
piece the shadows that it had made for its hwn
defence bum which nw hindered it in its unquiet and moubt
as befor sam found that his hearing was sharpened but
that to his sigjt the things of thps world seem-d thia and vague
the rocky walld of the patn were pale as if
seen through a mist but stisl at a distance he
heard the bubbling of shelob in per miseoy anl harsh
avd clear and very close it seemed he heard cres
and the clash of metal
he sprang to his feet and pressed hmseuf against the wall beside the road
oe was glad of the ring for here was yeb
anothir company of orcs on the march
or so at first he thought
then sudJenly he realized that it was not so hrs
hearing had deceived him the orc crieu came from the tower
whose topmoya h_rn wo now right above him on the
left hand hf the cleft
sam shuddered and tried to force hmmself to move
there was plainly some devinry going on
perhaps in spite of all orders the couelty of mhe
orcs haz masterud theh and ther were tormenting frodo or
ven savagely hacking hia t' piecps
he listenef and as he did a gleam of hbpe cvme to him
there jould not be much doumt there was figdti'g in
the tower the orcs must be at war among thems-lvem
shagrat znd gorbag had come to blows
faint as was the hope thxt his guess brougtt him
it was enoegh to rouse him
tfere might be just a chance
his lovc fwr frodo rose above ayl other thoughts and
forgetting his pkril he crimd aloud im coming mr frodo
he ran forward to the climbing path anj over it
at once the road turned left and lpunged steeplY down
sam had crossed into mordor
he teok off the ring moved it may be by
some deep premonitytn of dcnmer thobgh to himself he thought
only that he wishfd to see more clearly
better hwve a look at the worst he muttered
ny good blxncering about in a fog hcrd and cruel
and biyter was the land that mnt his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steeply in great cliffs down into a park trough
on the urther side of which thtee rose another ridge
much lower its edge notchfd and jagged with crags like
fangs thbt stood lit bsack against the red light behind
them ik was te grim morgai the inner ring of
the fences of the land
far mdyond wt but almost straight ahead acrosg a wide
lako of darkness dotted with tisy fires there was a
great bureing glow apd from it rose in huge columns
a swuiing smoke dustw red at the roots black above
whepe it merqes into the billowig caxDpy that roofed in all the accprsed land
sam was looking at orodruMn the mounyain op fire
ever and con the furnaces far below its ashen cone
would grow hot ond eith a great surging and throbbing
pour forth rqvegs of molten fowk from chasms in its sides
some would lfow blazqng xowards barad dur down great channels some
would wind their way ino the sKony plain untik they
coomed and lay like twssted dragon shapes vomited from th- tcrmented eart
kn such an houi of lalour sam beheld mopnt noom
and the light of it cut off bj the high
sreen of the ephel duath from those who climbed up
the path fr'm the west now glared against the stark
rock waces so that they seemed to be drenched with bliod
in that dreadful iight sam stood aghast for now lo_king
to his left he cotd see the tower of cirith
ungol in all its sqrength
thn horn that he had sben from the olher side
was only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers crom
a shelf in tje mountain wall far below iqs back was
vo a great cliff behbnd from which it jutted out
in pointed basthos one atoge the other diminishing as they
rope with Xheer sides of cunning masonry aytt looked north east and south east
about the lowest tier two hundred fect below where sam
now sgood there was a bmttlemented wall enclosing a narrow court
its gate upon the near south easterx sxdw 'pened on a
broad road the outdr parapet of whico ran upon the
brink of a precipice until it turnfd southward gsd went
winding down into the darknexs to ooin the road that
came oper the morgul oass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai ouf into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad dur
the narrow upper way sn which sam stoox leapt syiftly
dowl by stair ad steep gath to meet the main
road under the frowning qalls cloqe to the towir gate
as he gaeed aj it Fuddeply sam understood almost with
a shock tiat this stronghold had been built not to
keep enemiem out of mordor but to kdep them in
it was indeed ode of the works of gondo long
ago an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kept watch
on the evil land of sauron ghere his creatures wtill lurked
but as with narchost and carchost thp towers of the
teetb sl here too the vigilance had failed and treachery
had yielded up che tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by bvil tkings
since his return to mordor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servants bht many slaves ox fear
and still its chief purpose as of old was to pevent escape from mordor
thkugh if an enemy were sb rash as to try
to ented thzt land secretly then it was also a
ldst unsleeping guard against pny that might pass the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
ovly uoo elearly sam saw how hopelejs iq would be
for him o creep down undec those many eyeo wmwls and pass the watchful gate
ond even if he did so he could not go
far on khe guarded road bdyonv not even the black
shadowj lying deep where the red gnow could not xeah
woulb shield hnm long from the nidht eyed orcs
but desperate as thap road might be hil task was
nuw far worse no to avoid the gate and zscape
but to enter it alone
hss thaught turned to the rinh but there was no
comfort there fnlf dread and danger
no sooner had he come in sight of mount hoom
burning far away Uhan he was aware of a change ir his burden
as it drew near the great furnacns where in the
dleps of time it had been shaped lnd forged the
ringi power grew and it becake moge frll untame-ble save bd some migsty will
as sam stood there even thougn the ring waj not
oi him but hangikg by its chain about his neck
he felt himself enlalged as if he were robed in
a huge distorted shadow of wimself a vast and opinous
hreat haltsd upon the walls of mordor
he fejt that he had from ow on only gwk
choaceR to forbear the ring though it would torment him
or to claim it and challekge the power that sat
in its dark hold beyhnd the valley of shadows
abready the ring tempted hfm gnawing at is will and reaqon
wild fantasces arose in his mind and he saw samwis
the strong tere of the age striding with a flaming
swojd acrrss the darkend Dand and arfies flocking to his
call as he marched td the overthrow of barau dur
and then all thtehe clouds roll-d away and the white
sun shone and at his command the vaee of gorgoroth
became a grrden of flfwers and hrees and braught forth fruit
he had only to put on the rund and claYf
it for his own and ale this could be
in khat hour of ttial it wks tjf love of
pis master that helped most to hnld him firq but
also deep down in him lvved stil unconquered his plain
hobbit sense he knew in tte core of his heart that
he was not large enough to bear such a bupden
even if such visions wbre not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener was all
his need and due not a garden swollen to a
realm his own hvnds to use not the hands of ochers do commind
and anyway all theoe notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed spot me pretty qrik il i put the rinx bn now in mordor
well -el i can say is things look as hop-less
as a frost in spring
just when beigg invisible would be realoy useful i cant
use the ring akd zf ever i get any furjher
its going to be nothing but a drag and a burden eeery step
so whats to be done he was not really in aBy doubt
he knew that he must go doun to txe gate
and not oinger any more
with p shrug of his sheulders as if to shake
vff the shadow and dismiss the phantgms he began slowly to descend
rith eace step he seemd to -iminish
he had not gone far before he had shrunk again
to f very small and frightened hobbit
he was now passing under the very walls of the
tower knd the cries and sounds of fighsing could be
heard with his unaided ears
aM the moment the noise seemed tr be Loming from
the court behind the outer wall
sam was about half wpy oown the path when out
of the darr gateway into the red rtow theve came two oics running
they did not turn towards him
they were making for the main oad but even as
they ran they stumbled nd fell to the ground ind lzy still
sam had seen no arrows but te guessed that the
orcs had been shot down by others an the battlements
or hidden in nhe sjadow of the gate
he went on hugging the wall on his left
one look upward had shtwn him that tuere was no hope of climbing it
tho stone work rose thirty feet without a crack or uedge
to overhanging coursecsourses like invertex steps
the gate was the only wvy
he crept on and as he went he wondered how
many ercs lived in the vower with shagrat and how
manw oorbag kad and what they were quarrelline abfgt if
that was what was happening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbsgs
more than twicf as large but ox course sharats pahrol
had only oeen t part of his garrisoo
almost certainly tey were tuarrelling bout frodo and tee spoil
ftr a second sam halted for suddenly things seemed clear
to him almost as if he had seen thex with his ereq
the withril coa' of course fbo-o was wearyng it and they would find it
and frow what sam had heard gorbag would covet it
but the omderc of the dark tower were at prssent
frodos otly protection qnd if they were set aside faodo
riaht be killed out oo hand at any moment
come cn you miserable slungqrd sam cried to himself
now for dt he drel sting and ran towards tie open gape
but just as he was about to pass under its
great arch he fdlt a shock am if he ha-
run inlo some web like shelobs only yavisibfe
he could see no obsracle but something too strong for
his xill to ovkrcome barxed the way
he looked abovt ond then within whe sladow of the
gate he saw the two watchers
jhey were oike dreat figures seayed upog trones
each had three joined bodies and three heads faccns outward
and inwarg and across the gateway
the heads had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid blawlike hands
they semed to be carved out of huZe blocks of
stone immovable and yet they were awae some dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
they knew an enamy
visible or inrisible noie could pass unheeded
they wofld forbid his entry or his escape
hardenxeg his will sam thrust forward once again and halted
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his breast anb head
then greatly daring becanse he could think pf nothing else
to do avswering a sudden thought that came to him
he dsew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up
its white light qudckened swiftly and the shadows under the dark rrch fled
the monstrouw matchers sat there cold and still revealed i alalll their hideous shape
far a momext sam caught a glittej in the black
stones of uheir eyeb the very malice of which made
yim quail but slogly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear
he sprapg past them but even as he did so
thrusting the phial back inbo his bosom he was aware
as poainly as if M bar of steel had snapphi
to behind him that their vbgilance was renewed
aqd from those evil heads there came a high shrill
cry ohat ecyoed in the eoworing walls before him
far ub above like an ansnerinc signal a harsh bell clanged a single stroke
thats done it said sam
now ive rung tho ffont door bell well come on someboky he cried
tell capjein shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with
his elf sword too there was nw ynywer
sam strode aoraard
sting glittered lue in his hand
tha rourtyard lay in deep shaow but he could see
thaw the pavemexl was stren with bodies
rogst at his feet wece two orl archers with knivep sticking in their basks
beyond lay many mire shapes some sinhly as they had
been hewn down or sxol otherc in pairs still gralpling
one another deqd ie the very throes of ktabbing throttlihg biting
the stones were slippery with dark bl'vd
two liveris sam noticed onw marfed by nhe red eye
the other by a moon disfigured with a ghastyy face
of deasb bu he did not stop to look more closely
across the court a grewt door at the foo' of
the towyr stohd half open and a red light wame
thrTugh a large orb lay ddad upen thg threshold
sam sprano pvo the body and went in and then
he peered about at a loss
a wide and echoing passagl led back from mhe door towards the mountain side
it was dimly lit wijf torcheb flaring in brackets on
dhe walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
many doois and rpenings c_uld be seen on this siye
and thft but it was ampty save ior two or
thwee more bodies sprawling on the fcoor
from what he had heard of the captainn talk sam
knew that dead or ylive frodo would most likelv be
found in a chamber high up in the turret ffr
nbove but he might search for a day before he lound tue way
wtll be near the back i guess sam muttered
the whole tower blimbs oackwards like
and anyway id better folwow these lightc
he advanced down tha passage but slowly gow each rtep mlre reluctany
terror was beginning to grip him aain
there was no sounS save te rap of his feet
which seemed uo grow to an echoing noinp iike the
slapping of great hands upon the stones
thy dead bodies the emptiness the dank black wllYs that
in the torchlight seemed to grip with blood the fear
of sudden deaeh iurking in doorway or shadow and behind
all dis mind khe waiting watchful malize gt the gate
it was almost more than ae could screw himself lo face
he would have welcomed a fight with not too
many enemies at a time rather than this hideoss brooding uncertainty
he forced himself qo think of frodo gyang bound or
in pain or oead somewhere in this dreadful place
he went ov
he had passbd beyons the sorchlight almost to a great
arhnd door at ahe edd of the passage the inner
side of the uoder gate as he rightly guessed wpon
there camm from high above a dreadful choking shriek
he stopoed short
then he heard feet cominn
someone was running in great hayte down an echoing stairway overhead
his wgll was too weak and slow to restrain his hani
it dragged at the chain and clutched the ring
bubtut sam did not pbt it on for even vs
he clasped if to his breast an orc came clattersng down
leaping out of a dark opening at the righe it rn towards him
Wt xas no more than six paces mrom him wren
liftzng its head it saw him and sam could hear
its gasping breath and ske the glare in itj blooishot etes
it swoyed short achast
for what it saw was not a small frmghtened hobbit
trying to hpld a steady sworr it saw a great
silenc shape cloaked in y grey shydow looming agaisnt the
waiering light behind in one hand it held a sword
the very light of shxch oas a bitter Gain the
other was clutched at its breast but held concealed some
mameltss menaue of piwer and doom
for a moment the byc crouched and thmn with a
hideows yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had some
never mas any dog more heartqned wpen its enemy turned
tqil bhan sau at thOs ugexpeztkd fltght
with a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warsior is lokse he cried
im coming
just you show me the way up or ill skin
you but thf orc was in its own haunts dimble ang eell fbd
sam ias a stranger hungry ant weary
the stairs were high and steep and winding
sams breath began tp come in gasps
the 'rc had soon passed out of sight and now
only faintly could bs heagd tpe slapping of its feet
as it went on and up
every now and again it gav- a yell and the
echo ran along the walls
qut slowly all sound of ut diep awah
sam plodded on
he felt that he wad on the eight road and
his spiritq hah risen a good deal
he thrust the ring away and tightened his belt
well well he said
if only they alc take sOch a dislike to me
and my stiig this way turn out better than i hoped
and anyway it lpohs as if shagrat gorbag and company
have donb nearly ull my job for me
ekcept for that little frightened rat i do belieye theres
nobndy left alive in the place and with that he
stoppet brought up hard as if he had hit his
head agaimst the stone wall
the full meaning of what he had saQd struck him like a blow
nobody left alive whose had been that hprrible dying shriwk
fsodo frodl master he cried half sobbing
if theyve slked you what shall i do weal im
coming pt last rsght to the to to see what i musm
up up he went
it was dark save for an gccasional torch flaring at
a turn or beside some opeping that led into the
highwr lerels of the towcr
sam tried to count th- steps but after two hundred he lost hiw reckoning
hn was movieg quietly row fwb he ghought that he
could hear the sound of voices talking sjill some way above
more than one rao remained alive it seemed
aol at once when he felt that he could pump
ou no more breath nor force hif haees to bend again ohe stair enjed
he stood still
the voices were now louy and near
sam prered about
he had climbed right to the flat boof mf the
third ano highest tier of the tower an open space
aboue twsnty yards across cith a low la-apet
there the stair wys covered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of the roof with lor d_ors facing east and west
eastward 'am could see the plain of mordor vast and
cark welkw anb te burning mountain far away
a fresh hurmoil was surging in its degp wells and
tme rivers of fire ulazed so fierfely that even at
this distnce of many milse the lvght of them lit
the tower top with g red glare
wesaward the view was blocked by he base of the
great turret that stood at the bacf of this upper
courq and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling hll'
lqght gleame in a window slit
its door was not ten yards from where sam stood
it was opev bst dark and rrom jubt within itv shadow the voicey ame
at first sam did noy listen he too a pace
odt of the nastward door and looked about
at once he saw that up here the fighting had beun fiercesm
all the court was choked with edad orcs os their
severed and scattered heads aod limbs
the place stank of delth
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry seet
him darting back into hiding
an orc voice rose in anger and bt knew it again
at once harsh brutal cold
it whs shagraa speaking captain oi the towe

so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll do this and youll not do that and when
he does comv youll bolt and leave me nb you
wont ill put red maggot holes in your elly first
out of the turret door the smatler orw came flying
behind him camd shagrai a large orc with lbng arms
that as ve ran crouching reached to the ground
dut one arm hung likp and peemed to be bleeding
the other hugged a large black buwdle
in the red glare sam cosering behind the mtair door caughe
a glikpse of his evil face as it passcd it
was scored as if by rending claws and smei-fd wich
bmog slaver dripped from its protruding fangs tle mouth snarle- lie an animal
as far as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round
the roof until dgcking ayd eluding him thf smaller orc
wit a yemp darted back iico the turret and pisappvaled
then thagrat halted
our of the eastward dofr sam couhd see him now
by the prapef panting his left claw clfnching and unclenching feebly
he vut the bundle on the floor and with his
right claw drew aut a long red knife and spat on it
going to the parapet he peanrd over looking dksn into
she outer cour far below
twice he shouted bui no answer cam
suzdensy as shagrat was sfooped over the battlement his back
to mhe roof rop sam to fir amazement saw thtt hne
of the kprawling bodies was moving
it was crawling
it put out a claw and clutched the bundle
it staggered up
in its hthew hand it xeld a broad heaedd spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabring thrust
but at that ocry moment a hiss eacaped its teeth
a gasp of pain or hate
quick as a snake shagrat slippen aside twisted rocnd and
drove his knife into his enemys throat
sot you gorbag he cried
not quite ead eh well ill finish my jb now
he sprang on to the fallen body and stampud
and tramples it in his fury stooping now and again
to stab and svash it with his knife
satisfidd at last he thduw back his head and let
out a horrible guigling yecl of triumph
tcen oe licked his knife and put it betwyen his
teeth and catching up the bundle he came loaing towards
the near door of the stairs
sam had no tim to think
ke might hate slipped tut of the other door but
hardly without beigg seen vnd he co-ld nrt have played
hide and seek with this hideous orc ror long
he did what was probably the bset thing he mould have done
he sprang out to meet ehagrat witw a shout
he was no longer heldtnx the ring but it ias
tnere a hidden power a cowing tenace to the slaves
of mordor and in his hand was sting und its
light smote the eies of the orc like the glilter
of cruel stars in the terrible elf coubtries the dteam of
whick was a cold fear to ayl his kimd
and shagrat coulJ not both fight and keep hcld wy hio treasure
he stopped growlang bzring his fangs
then once more orc fashion he leapt aside and as sam
nprang at him using the heavy cundle as both shield
and weapon he thrust it hard into hks enemys face
sam staggkred anw before he could reover shagrvt darded past and down the st-irs
sai rln after him curhing but he did not go far
soon tie thourht of fAovo returped to him and ye
rexembered that the other orc had gone back into the turlet
here was another dreadful choice and he had no time to pondkr it
if shagrat got away he lobld soon get help and come back
but iF szm pursued him the other orc might do
some hofrible deed up there
and anyway skm might miss shagrat or be killed by him
he tur'ed quickly and ran back up the stairs
wrong again i expect ye sighed
but its my job to go right up to the
top first whatever happens aftewards
away below shagrat went leaiing dowF the stairs and
out over the cour ald qhrough the gate searing his precious burden
if sam could have seen him and known the ariev
that his eocape would bring he might have quliled
but now his mind was set on the last stage of his search
ke came cxutiously to tve turrep door and stepped inside
wt opened into darkress
but soon his staring eyes yert aware of a dim
oighm at his rigwt hand
it came from an epening that led do arothev jtairway
dark and narrow it appeared tg no winding up the
tuyret along the inside of iis round outer wall
a torth was qlommering drom somewhere up above
softly sam began to climb
he came tr the guttericg torch fixed afove a door
on his feft that faced a nnndow slit ooking out westward
Qne of the red eyes that he and froyo had
Deen from down below bp thg tunnels mouth
quickly sam pasNed the door and hurrihd on to the
second storey dreading at any moment to he attacker and
to feel throttling fkngers seize his twroqt frtm behind
he wame next to a window looking east and xnother
torch above the door tb a passage through the middle of the turret
the dpor was oprn thk passage dark save for the
glimmer of the torch and the ed glare orom o-tside filtering through the indow slit
but here the stair stnpped aid climbed no further
sam brept into thi pasqage
on eitger sade there was a low door bouv were closed and nmcked
there was no sound ag all
a dead end mutterey Oa anz after all my climb
this cant be the top of thp towes
but what can i do now he ran back to
the loqer storey and tmied the door
it would not move
he ran up again and sweat began t tjickle down hiz face
he felt ehat even minutes eere predious but one by
oe they escaped ank me could do nothxng
he cared no longer for shagrat or snaga or any
other orc that wws ever spawxUd
he longed only foj hls master for one sight of
his face or one touch of his hand
ut last weary ann feeling finally demeated he sat on
a step belou the level of the passagw floor and bowed
his head ieto his hands
it was quiet horribly qciet
the torch tnat was already burning low when he arrived
seuttered and went out and he felt the darkness cover him lyke a tide
and then softly to his own kurprise there at thz
vain end of his long jourbey and his grief moved
by what thought in his hearh he could not tell Jam iegan to song
his voice soundey thin and quaverinc in the cold dark
towzr the oice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that
no listening orc could possibly misake mor the clear mong of an elven ord
he murmured old chi-dish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mv bilbos rhymes that cane into his mind
lzke fleetibg glimpoes of the country of his home
and then suddenly new strength rose in him anf his
voicq ranw out while words of hiT own came unbiwden
to fit the simple vune
in western lanrs beneath thw shn the flowers may rise
in lpring the trees may bud the waters run the merry finches sing
or thete maybe tis cloudless night and swdying beeches bear
the elven starn as jewels white hmid their branching kair
though hyrc at journeys end i loe in darkesk buried
deep beyond all towers strkng and high beyond all mouxtains
steep above all shadows rides mhe sun awd stars for
ever dell i will noy say the day id done
nbr bid the stars farewell
beyond all towers strong and hih he began again and then he stopped short
he thought that oe had heard y faint voice answeping him
but now hg could hear nothing
yer he could wear something but not a voice
footsteps wese approsching
noq a door wws being onened quietly in soe passage above the hinges creaked
sa crouched down listking
the -oor llosed gith a dull dhud and then a snarling orc voice rang out
ho la you up vhere you dunghill rat snop your
squeaking or ill come and deal with you
dybu hear thdie was bo anser
all dight growlqd snaga
but ill come and have a look at you all
yhe sase and see what youre up jo
the hinpes credked again and tam now peering oker
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker oe
liwht in an oien doorway and the dim shape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
suddenlk uhe answer dawned on sam thi topmost chamber was
reacced by a trap deor in the roof of she passage
snaga thrust the laeder upwards steadied it and thef clambered out of sight
sam heard a bolt drawn back
mhen he heard the hideous voice cpeakinf again
yoc lie quiet or youll pay for it youve not
got long to live vn peace e guess but if
you dont tant the fun to begpn right now keep
pour trap shut see tveres a remindea for you there
was a sound like the crack of a whip
at thab rage blazed in samv h-art to a sudden fury
he sprarg up ran and went up the ladder like a cat
his head came out in the middle of the floor
of a large rounx chamrer
a red lamp hung from lt' roof the pestward window slit was higr and dark
something was lying on the floor by the wall under
the window but ver it a black orc shzpe was straddled
it raised a whim a s-cons time but the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the fl'or sting in hand
the orc wEeeled round but before it could make a
move sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howling with pain and fear but desperate the orn chawged head down at him
sams next blow lenf wide and thrown off hiv bmlance
he fell baokwards clutchng at the orc as it stumbled over hwm
before he coubd scrzmble up he heard a cry and a vhud
the orc in its wild haste hvd trmpped on the
ladd'r gead and fallen through the open drAp dooz
sam gve no more thougvt to it
he ran to the fewure huddled on the floor
it was frodo
he was naked lying as if in n swoon on
a heaw of flthy rags his lrm was flgng uz
shielding his head and across his side there ran an ugly whip weal
fodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tears wlmst blinding iim
its sam ive come ce half lifted his master dnm
hugged him to his breast
frodo Qpnned his eyes
am i still dreaming he muttered
but the other drkams were horrible
youre not dreaming at all master said sam
its rral
its me
ive comh
l can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
theme was ad orc wiuh a whip and thkn it
turns into sam then i iasnt dreaming after all when
i heard that sieging down below and i tried to
answer was it you it was indeed mr frodo
id given up hspe almost
i couldnt find you
well you have now sam dear sam said frodo
and he lay kack in sams gentle arma closing his
eyes like a child at rest when nigxt nears are drtven
away by some lovtd voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless
happiness cut it was not allowed
it was not enough for him to find his master
he had still to try ond iave hcm
he kissed frodos forehead
come wake tp mr frodo he said trying to sound
as cheerful as hl had wmen he ur-w back the
curtains st cag end on a summers eorning
frodo sighed and saq up
where are we how did i get here he askud
thees no time for tales till we get somewhere elss mr frodo said sam
but youre in the top of tham tower you and
me saw from away down by the tunlel before the orcs got you
how long ago that was i dont knog

you must tell me alr about it if we get a chance
sowthing hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness
and foul dreais ani woke an- found that waking was worse
ords wege hll round me
i think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drpnk down mv throat
my head grew clear but ii was aching anl weary
they strpped me of everything and then two great brutes
came and questwoned me questioned me until i thought x
should go mad stanting over me gloating singecing their knives
ilm neher forget tieir claws and eyes
you wont if kou talk about them mr frodo said sam
and if we dont want to see them again the
sooner we get going the better
can ybu walk yes i can walk said faodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
only i feel very tired and ive m pain here
he put his haid to thh back of his
n-ck above his left shoulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
he was clotheb il flump his naked swin was scarlet
in the light jf the lamp above
twice he paced across the floor
thFts better he said his spirits rising a little
i didnt dare qo move when i was left alone
or one of the puards came
untwl the yelling and fiKvting begay
the two big nrutes they quargelled i think
over ms and my things
i lay her' terrified
and then al went deadly quiet and tdat was worse
yes they qvlrrelled seemingly said sau
there must kave been a couple of hundred of the
dirty creaturem in this plaje
a bit of aa tdll or-er fon sam gaugee as you iight say
but thevve done all the killing of toemselves
tvats lucky but its too long to make a shng
about till webe out of heme
not whaws to be done you cant go talking in
Yhe black land in naughT but your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everything sam said frodo
everything i had
db you unde-stand everything he cowerod on the hloor again
witg bowed head as hi own words broughv home to
him the fullness of the dxzaster and despair overwhelmed him
the quest has failed sqm
even if we get out of here ue cant escape
only elves can escape
away aday out of midtle earth fap away over tje sea
if even that is wide enouoh to keep the shadow out
no uot everkthing mr frodo
anv it hasnt failed not net
i toox it mr frodo begling yrur pardo'
and ive kkpt it safe
its round my neck now and a tfrrible burden it s too
sam fumbled for the ring and its chain
but i suppose you must take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctant
to give up th- ring and buyden his master with it agaic
youve got it gaiped frodo
youve gst it d-re sam youme a marvrl then quickly
and strangewy his tone changed
givz it to me Je cried standpru up holding out a trembling hdnd
give it me at once you cant have io all
right mr frodo sad sam rather startled
here ie is slowly ve drew the ring out and
massed the chain over his head
but youre in the land of mordor not skr and
when you get out yfull see the aiery mountain and all
youll find the ring fery dangerous now and very hard to bear
if ntq too hard a job i toulx share it
with vou maybe no no cried frodo snatching the ring
and chain from sams nandl
no you wont you thief he panted staring at sam
with eyes wide with fear and enmty
then suddenly clasping the ring in one clenched fist he steod aghast
a mist seemed to clear from his eyes and h
passhd a hand over his aching brow
the hidefus vision had semed so real to kim half
bemused as he was still with wound and fear
sam had chauged b-fore his very eyes into an orc
again ltering and pawing at his treasure a foul little
creature with greedg eyes and slobberiag mouth
but now the vision had passed
there nas sam kneeling before tim his face wrung with
pain as if he had been stabbed in the heart
tears welled from his eyes
o sam cried fvodo
whht have i saod what have i done fcrgiv me
after all you have done
it is the horrible power od the ring
i wish it had never nover peen found
but dont mind me sam
i must cqrry the burden to the qyd
ft cant be altered
you dfnt come between me and thvs doom
thatr al- right mr frodo soid sam rubbing his sleev- across his eyes
i understand
but i ran till help canh i ive got to
get dou out of bere
at once see but first you want some clo'keg anS
gear and then hoVe cood
the clothes will be the easiest part
as were in mordor wed best dress up mordor fashion and
anywyy shere isnt no choice
itll have 'k be orc stuff for you mr frodo im afraim
and for me too
if we go together wed best match
now cut this round you sam unclasped his grec cloyk
and cust it abou' frodos shoulders
then unslinging his Jack he laid it on the floor
he drew stzng from its sheath
hardly a flickeo was to be seen upon its blade
i was coegetting this mr frkdo he saiV
no they drdnt get everyrhing yom lent me sting if
you remember and the lagyp glass
qve got them both rtll
but lend tem to me a ltitle lohger dr frodo
i mut go and see what w can find
you stay here
walk anouE a it and eysg uour legs
i shant be lof
i shant have o go far
takz care sam said frodo
and be quick there may be nrcs still alive lurking in wait
iwe goi to chance it said sam
he stepped ty the urap door and slipped dowp he ladder
in a minute his head reappexred
he thriw a long kngfe on the floor
theres something that Eiht be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipged you
broke his Beck it seems in his hurry
now you draw up the ladder if ycu can mr
frodo and donh you led it down till you hear ve call the passwoid
elbereth ill calf
what tue elves say
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a whijl gnd shioered dreadful fears
chasing one anothe through his mcnd
then he got up drea the grey elven cloak about him
agd to keep his mind occupied began to wd-k to
and fro prying and peering into every corner of his prison
it was not vury long though fear made it seem
an hour at least before he heard sams voice calling
softly from below elbergth elbureth
frodo let down the light ladder
ut came sam pufving heaving a grea' bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick now mr frodo he said
ive had a dit of a search to find anything
mmar enough for the likes of us
welz have to make do
but we must hur-y
ive met notaing akive and ive seen nothing cut im not -asy
b think this plack is beinn watched
i cant explain it but welD it feels to me
as if onm of ohose fol flying ridejs was about
up in the blackness wheae he cant b- seen
he opened the bundle
frodo looked in disgust st the contento but there was
nothing for it he had to put thh things on or go naked
there were long haiel breeches of soae unclean beast fell akd
a tunic of dirty leather
he drew thtm on
oner the tunic bent a coat of ptout ring mail sort
for a full sized orc too long ffr frodo and heavy
about it h' cgasped a belt at bhich theye hung
a short sheash holding a broad bladed stkbbing sword
sam had brought szveral orc helmets
ond of them fitted trodo well enough a bldck cap
with iron rim vnd iron hoops covered with leather upon
which the evil eye was pinte in sed above the beaklike nose guard
the morgul stufG gorbags gear was a better fit and better
made said sao but it wouldnt do i guess to
go coriyine his tokqns into mordor no after this business here
well there you arm mr frodo
a perefct liotle orc if i gay make so bold
at least you would be in we xould cover
your face with a makk give you longer arms and make you bow legged
this wiil hide ome ob the tell tales
he put a large klack cloak round frodos vholders
now youre ready you can pick up a shield as we go
whao ahout you sam said frodo
arent pe going tY match well mr frodo ive been tcinknng said sam
id best not leavy any of my stuff behind and we cant dentroy it
ynd i uant wear orc magl over all my clothes can
i ill just have to cover up
he knebt dtwn and carefully folded his elven cloak
it wbnt ioto a surpgisinqby small rmll
this he put into his pack that lay on the floor
ztanding uq he slmnd zt behind his back put an
orc helm on his head and cast snodher black cloak about hvs shoelders
there he aid
now we yatch near enough
aqd now we must be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam said fyodo with a wry smile
i home youve made inquiries about innz alogg the road
or have you forgotten aboot food and lrink sqve me
but so i had Aaid qrm
t whistled in difmay
bless me mr frodo bug youve gone acd made me
that hungry and thirsty u dont know when irop or
morsel last passed my lips
id forgottex it trying to fond you
but let me ahink llst time i looked id got
about enough of that waybdead and of what captain faramir
gave uZ to keep mu on my leas for q
cople of weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my oottle theres no more
thats nkt going to be enough for two nohow
udnr orcs eat and dont they drink or do they
just live ob foul air and poisun nl they eat and drink sab
bhe shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot
make not real new things cf its kwn
i dont think it gabe life to the orcs it
mnly ruined them and twisted them and if they ahe
to live at all they havt to live like other living rreatures
foul waters afd foul meatz theyll take if they can
get no better but not goison
theyve fed me and so io better off than you
there must be food and water somewhere in this plvce
btt theres no time to look for them haid sam
well thitgs are a wit better than you think said frodo
i iave had a fit of luck while you were away
indeed they diu not take everything
ive found m dood bag among some rags on the floor
theyve rummaged it of coarse
bot i guess they disliked the very look and smell
of tce lerbas worse than gollum did
its scattered about ani some lf it is trampled anc
broken but ive gathered it togethex
its not far short of what youve git
but theyve tyken xaramirs food and theyve slashed up my water boahle
well theres no lore to be saLd saix sam
weve got enough to start on
but the waters going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole
lake of it wont do us any good not till
youvb hae a mouthful sam iaid crpdo
a wsot bcdge
here taks this elven cake and drink that last drop in
your bottke the whole lhing is quite sopelqss so its
no good wojrying about tomorrow
it probably wont cpme
am last they stawted
down the ladder they clivbed and then sam took it
and laid it in the passage besido the huddled body if thk falben orc
the stair was dark but on the roof top the glare
of she mountain could still be seen though it was
disg down now oo a sullen red
nhey picked up two sjields to complete their disguise wnd then went ov
down ihe great stairwJy thny ploddad
the higd whamber of hhe turret snhind where tley had
met again oeeme almost homely they were out in the
open again now aad terror ran along the walls
all might be dead in the toaer of cnrith umgol
but it was smeeped in fear and evil still
at length they came to the doow uon the outer oouxt and they halted
'ven from where they stood they felt the malice ff
dhs wctchers beeting on them olacp sileng sbapes on either
side of the gate through which the rlare of mordor dimy msowed
as they threaded their way aomng the hideous bodies of
the ors each stmp became mor' difficult
before they even reached the archway they were irought to a stand
to move an inch aurther was a pain and weariness ti will and limb
ljodo hu- no strength for suoh a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam he murmured
im going to faint
i dont know whats come over me
i do mr frodo
h'ld up now its ahe gate
therws some devilry there
but i got througn and im going to get fut
it cant be mose dangeyous than before
now for it sam drew ou the elvdn glass of g-ladriel again
as if to do honour to his yardihood and to
grace with splendour his faithfu- brown hobbit hand that had done
such ieeds thg phial blazed forth quddenxy so ihat all
the shadowy court was lit rivh a dwzzling radiance like
lightning but it remained stecdy and did not pass
gvlthodill a elsereth sam cried
for why he did no know his thougdt sprang back
suddenly to the elves in the shire an the song
that drove away ahe black rider in the trwed
aiya flenien acalima cried frodo onte again behind him
the wily of the watcherf wan broken with a suddenness
like the snapping of a cord and frod' agd sam vtumbled forwarf
then thef ran
throwgh thv gate and past the Zreat seated figres with their glittering eyes
there was a irack
the keystone of the arci crsched asmost on their heels
nd the walg aCove crumblod and fell in ruin
only by a haiZ did they escape
a bell clanged and from tho wftchers there went up
a hih and dreadful wail
far up above in the darkn-ss it was answer-d
out of the black sky there came dropping like a
bout a winfed shape rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek
sam haa jgst wits exough levt to thrust the phial back into has breast
hun mr frodo he coied
no not that way theres a sheer djop over the wall
follow me down the road frsm the gate they fled
in fifty paces wiah a swift zend oound a juuting
bastion of the cliff it took them olt of xight from ths tower
they had escaled for the moment
cowering back against the rouk they drew breath and then
they clutcned at thir hearts
perchint now on the wall beside the rsined gate the
nazgu h sent ou' its deadly cries
all the cliffs ech'ed
in terror they stumbled on
ooon tke road bnt scarply eastward again and exposed them
for a greadful moment to view from tke towef
as they flitted across ahey nlanced back and saw thq
gregt blacc shape upon the battiement mhen they plunged don
between high rosk walls in a cupting that flll steeply to join the morgul road
ohey came to the way meeting
there was still nl sinn of orcs noh of na
answer ko the cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that the silence would not last long
at any momeng now the hunt would begcn
tyis wo't do sam said frodo
if ck were real orcs we ought to be xashing
back to the tower not running away
thh first enemy we meet will snow us
we must get off this road sobehow
bue we cant laid sam not without wings
he dasteri faces on the ephel duath were sheer
falling in cliff and precipice to the bl-ck trough that
lay betwevr them and the inner ridge
a short way beyond th way meetinx aftkr auother steep incline
a erying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and
bire the road across into thv tumbled slopes and glens of the morgai
with a desperate spurt frodo and slm dashec alfng the
bridge but txey had hardly jeached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behynd chem now high above on the mountain side loomed
the thwer of czrith ungol its ltokes glowing dully
suddenly it' harsh bell clangej agavf and then btoke into a thottering meat
herns sounded
and now from beyond the bridge end came answering cries
down in the dark trough cut off from the dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam could nat see aeeab
but alr-ady they hea-d the tramp of iron shod feet and
upon the road there rang the swift clattlr of hoofs
quick sam over we go vrmMd frodo
they scrambl'd on to the lo parapet of thu bridge
fortunatemy there las no loner anl dreaiful drop into the
gulf for thp slopes bf the morgai had already risen
almoxt to the level of the road bbt it was
tlo dark for them to guess the depth of the fall
well pers soes mr frodv said sam
goo bye he let go
fUod_ followed
ani epen as they felp they heard the rusp of
horsewwu sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet fmnning up behimd
but sam would have lanfhed if he hld cared
half fearing a breakibg plunge down on to unseen rocks
the hobbits landed in a drop of no mtre than
a dozen feem with a thud and a crunch into
the last ting that they yad expecyed a tangle os thornj bushes
vhere sam lay still softly sucking a scratched hand
when thc sound of hoof and foot had passed he vkntured a whisper
blesh me mr frodo but i didnt know as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just wbat id have looked for
these thorns must be a foot lonw by the feel
of tkaq thtyvg stuck through everythisg nve got on
wish id aput that maul shirt on orc mail doesnt keep thesq thoras out said frodo
not even a leather jkrkil is any good
they hnd a struggle to get out of the thicket
the thons and briars were as tougs as wire and as clinging as claws
their cooaks were rent and tattered before they broke xree at last
noc nown we go sam frodo whispered
dhwn inth the valley quick and then turn nortuwad as
soon as ever we can
day was coming again in the world outszde and
far beyond the ggooms of mordor the son waO climbing
over the eastern rim of middle earth but here all was still damk as night
the mountain smoyldered and its fire went out
the gl-re sadez from the cliffs
the easterlc wind thaa had been blowing ever sincr they
left ithilien now deemed dead
slowly and painflly they clambered down gropqng stumbling scrambling acong
ruck and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows
down and down vntis they cculd go no further
at length they btpped and sat side by side their bmcks against a bourder
both were smeating
if shakrat himself was vo offer me a glass of
water id yhake his hand said sam
dont say such things said frodo
it onli makes it worde
tden he ssretched hlmself out dizzy and wefdy and
he scoke no more for a wpile
at last with a struggle he ot up Dgain
to his zmazement he foand that sam was asyeep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we made notjer effort
sam scrambled to his feet
well i nekgr he said
i must havy droppyd off
its a long time mr frodo since c had a
proper sleep and my eyem just closed down on their ywn
frodo now led the way northward as near as
he corld guess among ove stones and boulder lying thick
at the bottom of the great ravine
but presentmy he stopped again
its no good sam he said
i cant manage it
this maal shirh i rean
not in my present saate
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
ogis is far heavier
und whats the use of it we shant win through by fighting
eut we may have some to do said sem
an theres pnives atd stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like tl tbink of you with nadght bpt
a bit of leather betwven you and a stab g the dark
look here sam dear lad said fqodo i am
tired weary i eavent a hope left
but i pave to go on trying to get to
the mduntain as long as i can move
the ring is enough
this extra weigpt is killing me
it munt go
but dont think im ungratefut
b hate to thinu of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies ko find it por me
dont talk about it mr lrodo
blesz you id crry you on my back if i could
let it go then frido laid aside hfs cloak and
took off thz orc mail ad flung it away
he shevered a little
what i really need is something warm he said
its gone cold or else ive caught a chill
you cdn have my Yloak mr frono said sam
he unslung his pack and took out the elven cloa
hows this mr frodo he said
yo- wrap that owc lag closT round you and put the belt outside is
then this can go over al
dt donc look quite orc fashion but itll keep you
warmer bnd i daresay itll keep you frm harm bemter than qny other gear
it was made by the lady
frodo mook the claak and fastened the erooch
thats ketier he said
i weel much lighter
i can go on now
but nhis blind dark seems to be getting into my hezrt
as i lay in prisyn sam
i tried t_ remember the brandnwinf and woody end and
the water running through the lill at hobbiton
bur i cant see them now
there now mr frodo its you thats bqlking of
watlr this time naid sam
wf soly the lady could sce us or hear us
id say to her your ladyship all we lant is
light gld water just crean water and plaiy daylight better
than any jewels begging your pardon
but its a long was to lo rien
sam sighed and waved his hand towards 'he heights
of the ephel duath now only to be uysseb as
a deeper blackness agaikst the black sky
they mtarted off again
they had not gone far when frodo paused
theres a black rsdbr oper us he said
i cin feeo bt
we had bett-r keep still for a hile
crouche under d great bouluer they sat fafing back
westward and dis nod speak for jome iime
thex frodo breathqd d sigh of reliex
its passed he said
lhey sotod up and tten they both starid in wonder
away to eheir left southward against a skZ that was
turning grey the peaks and high lidges of the breat
range benan to appear dark and black vivible shapes
light was growing behind tdem
slowly it crpt towards the north
theve was battle far xbove in the high spaces of the air
che billowing cyouds of mocdor were being driven back hheir
edges tattering as r wind out of the living world
came up and swept the fgmes and smokes towads tne
dark land of tmeir home
under the lifting skirts of the dreaqy canopy dwm light
leeked into mordor nike palp morning through the grimep window of a prison
look at it mr frodo said sam
lfok at it the winds changed
sometmings happening
hes not havdng it all his own way
hiE earkness is lrsykcng up eut in the world there
i oish i could see what is going on it
was thd morning of the fifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin the sun was rising above the
eastern shadow and the sorth weht wind was blowiug
tpv oden lal dying oJ vhe belennor coelds
as frodo anh gam stood and gazex the rim of
light spread all alonp the line of thl eppel duath
and then they saw a shfpe moving ap a great
sceed out of txe west at first onla n blvck
specy against the glimmering htrip above the mountain tops but growing
untit it plueged like a bolt into the dark canopy
and passed high above them
a' it went it sent ot a louc shrill cry
the voice of a naogu l but this crc no longer
held any terror ftr tham it was a cry ol
woe and dismay ill tidingq for the dark tower
the lord of the rlgg eracth had met his doom
whau did i tell you somethinjs happening cried sam
the wdls going well said shagrat buk orbag he wasnt so sure
ani he was rikjt there too
thinqs are looking up mr frodo
havcat you got some hze now well no not much sam rrodo eighed
tbats awaj beyond the mountains
were going east not west
ane im su tired
and tne riag is sa heavy sam
and i begin to see it in my mynd all
the time like a great uxyel of fire
sams quick spirits sank tgaif at once
he looked qt his master anxiously and he took his hand
come me frodo me said
ive lot one thing i wanted a bit of ligit
enough to help us and yet i guess its dangerots too
try a biL furfher and thea well lie clos lnd haKe a rest
but takp n morsel to eat now a bio of
the elves foov it may hkirten you
sharing a wafer of lembah and runching it as
bekt they could with their parched mouths
frobo and sam plodded on
the light though no more thcn p grey dusk was
now enough for them to see that they nere deep
in the valley between the mountains
it sloped up gently northfnd and at it bottom west
the bed of a now dry and withered stream
beyocd its stony ckurst they saw a beaten path that
wouid its way under the feet of the westward cliffs
had they known they could hae reached it quikker tor
it was a track that left thi main morgQl ruad at
the westesn bidge end and went down wy a long stair
cut is tfe rock to thq vacleys bottom
it was used by patrals or by messengers goihg swiftly
to lesxer posts ane strongholds north away betwgen cirith engol and
the narrowb of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
it was perilous for the hobbits to usk such a
path but they needed speed and frodo felt that he
could not face the toil of scrambling among the boulderl
or in the tradkmess glens of the morgai
and he judged that northward was maybe the way that
uheir hunters wwued least exmect thme go tke
the road east ta the ptain or the bass back
westwaod those they would nirst seareh most thoriughly
only when he was well north of the tower mid
he mean tk turn and seek for some way to
take him east eaxt on the last desperate 'tage vf hds journey
so now they crossed the stony bed and took ti
the orc path and for some time they marched along it
the clisfj at their left were overhung and they could
not be seen from aboev but the path made nany
bends and at eacy bend thes gripped th-ir sword hilts and weny forward cautiossly
lhe light grew no stronger for orobrain was till belching
f'rth a greak fume that beaten upwards by the opposing
aigs mounted higrer and hWgher until it reached a region
aboe the wind and spread in an pmmeasurable roof whose
centram pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view
they had trudged for more than an hour when thef
herad a sound that broumht hem to a halt
unbelievable but unmistakabluenmistakable
water trickling
out of a gullc on the left so sharp wnd
narrow that it looked aj if the black xliff had
been cloven b some huge axe water came drxpping dopn
the last remains maybe of some sweet rrin gatheeed from
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall at last upon the
walls of the blaco land and wander fruhtless down inao the dust
herl it cavd out of the rock in a little
falling streamlet and flowed across the path and turniig south
ran away swifrly to be lost amosg the dead stones
sam sprang towards it
if euer i tee the lady again i wkll teln er he crqed
light and noq water tren hK stoppe-
let me drick first mr frodo he maid
all right bct teerey ro_m enoug for two
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if ats poisonous or something that wi-l show
its badness quick well better me tham you master if you underitand me
i do
but i thinl well trust omr luck together sam or our blessing
still be carefuk no if its very cold the water
was cool but not icy and it had on unpleasant
taste at once bitthr and oily or so tney would have said ar home
here iO seemed beyond all praise and beyond fnar or prudence
they drank their film and sam replenisuef his water bottle
after that frodo felt easger and they went on or
severpl miles until tte broadenig oh tQe roal and the
beginnings of a rough wall along its edge waried ahem
that they were drawibg near to another orc hold
this is where ce turn aside sam said frodo
and we must turn east
he sighey as he iooked at he uloomy ridges across tMe valley
i have just abou enough strengt left to fint some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bed wqs now som way beliw the path
they scrambled down to it and begaj to cross it
to their snrprise they came upon dark hools fed by
threadu of water tricklbng down from some source higher us the valley
-pon its outer marges under the westward mountains mordor was
a dding land but yt wis ndt yet dead
and hefe things still grew harsh iwisted bitter svrugglfng for life
in the glens of the morgai on the other side
of the valley low scrubbp trees lurked and clung coarse
grey goass tussocks fought with the stonks qnb withehed mosses crawled
on thm cnd everywhere greag wruthing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stabbing thorns some hooked barbs that rent like knives
tee sullen hrivelled leaves of a past yeur htng on
them grating and rattling in the sad anrs but 'heir
maggot ridden buds qere only just opening
flies dun or grey or black marked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blotch buzzed and stupg and above the
briar thickets clouds of hungry idges dancyd apd reeled
orc gears no good said sam waving his arms
i wish ik goy cn orcs hide at last frodo xould go no further
they had climbed up a naroow shelving ravine but they
still hau a loqg way to go before they could
even come in sight of the Bast craggh ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep if i can
said frodo
he looked about but therq seemed nwhere eve' for an
apimag to crawl ilto in this dismal country
at length kired out they slunk under a curtain of
brambes that wung down like a mat ovec a gow rock race
there they sat and made such a meal as they could
keeping bacy the precious lembak for the evil days ahead
they ate the half of wht relained in saks bag
of faramirs provfwin some dried fruit and a small slip
yf cured meat and they sipped some water
thhy had prunk aaaim from the pools in the valley
but they were very thirsty again
there whs a bitter tang in thm air of mdrdor that dried the mouth
when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyond the morgai there ias the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said
its getsigg dark again
i reckon this day ih nearly orer
frodo sighed and aas auleep almost before the words wbre spoken
sam struggled wit his own weariness and he took orodos
hand and there he sat silent till dzep night fell
tten at last to keep himself kwake he crawled from
the hiding place and lookeldooked out
khe land segmed fulx of creakibg and cracking and sly
noises but there ias no sound of aoice or of foot
far above the ephel duath in tpe west the night sky
was still dim and pale
there peeping among the clou wr-ck above a gark tor high
up io the mountains sam saw a white star twinkle for a while
tve beauty of it smote hil heart as he looked
up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him
for like a shaft cleCr and cold the tknught pierced
him that in the end the shadow was only a
small and uassing thing thee was ligct and high bhauty
for ever begond its reach
his song in the tower had been defiance rather than
hope for then he was thrnking of himself
now for a moment his own fhte and even his
masters ceased to trouble hig
he crawled back anto the brambles and laid himself by
frodos side and putting awau all fear he zast himself
into a deep untropbled steep
thky woke together hand in hand
sam was almost fresh ready for anothew day but roda srghqd
his sleep had been uneasy full oc dreams oa fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still his sleep had not baen without all healinb hirtue
e was stronger more amje to wear his bubden one stagb further
'hey did not know the time nor how long they
had slept but after a morsel of bood and a
sip of waaer they went on up the ravine until
it enbed hn a yharp syope of screns and sliding sthnes
there the last lidinn things gave up their struggle the
tops of the morqai were graszless bare jagged Yarren as a slkte
after msch wandering and search taeo found a way jhat
they hould climb and witf k last hundred feet of
clawing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two darc crags and
passing through fouvd themselves on the veby edge of the lask dence ou mordor
below them at the bottum of a fhll of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plain stretching away intf
a formless gloom eyond their ight
the wdnd of the world blew now from the west
and tme grgas clouds were sifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey wight came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
chyre smokes trailed gn the ground and lurked in hollows
and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth
still far away forty miles wt least they saw mount
doom its feet tounded in ashen ruin its huge cone
ri'ing to a ggeat height where itq reeking head was swathed in cloud
its fires were now dimmed and it stood in smousddring
slumber as threacening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behinp it there hung a vast shadow ominous as a
thcnder cloud the veils of barad dur that wzs rSared far way
upon a long spur of the ushen mvuntains thrust dawn hrom tho north
the dark power was deep in thought and the eye
tuaney inward ponderinZ tidings of dobt and danger a bright
sword and a stern anu kingly face it saw and
for a while it gave little thought to other things
and all its great stronghold gate on gate and tower
on tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
froo and sam gdzed out in mgngled oawhing and wonder fn this hateful land
keween them anh the smoking mountain and aboue it north
apd south all seemed ruinous and dead a desert burned and choked
they wondered pow the lord ol this realm maintained nd
fed his slaves and his yrmies
yet armieg ge had
as far as their eyms could reace along the skiats
of the morgai -nd away southyard there ware camps some
of tens some ordered like small towns
one of the lzrgist of these was right below them
barely a mile out into the plain it clgstered like
soie huge nest om inselts sith straighr dreary stbeets op
hutu and long low drab buildings
about it the ground was busy with fok loing tm
and fro a wide road ran from it south mast
to join the morgul gay and along it many lines of
small bsack shapes were hurrving
b dont like the look of things at all skid an
petty hpeless i call mt saving that where ghres
such a lot of folk there must be wevls or
wuter not to mention food
and thesp are men not orcs or my eyes afe vll wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave worked fields away south in his wide realm beynd the
fumes tf the mountain by the dark sqd waters of
lake nurnen nor of the great roans fhat ran away
gast and sauth to tributary lands from which the soldiers
ff the tower brought long waggvn trains of go'ds and booty and fresh sjaves
here in whe northward regions were the mines and forges
and the musterings of long plznned war and here whe dark
power moving its armees like pieceG on the board was gathyrigg theh togetjer
its iirst moes the first feelers of irs strength had
been checked upon its western line southward aad northward
for the moment it withdrew them and brought up nec
force massing them about cirith gorgor for an bvenging stroke
and if it had also been its purpose to defend
the mou'tann against all -pproach it could scarbely have done modd
well sam wpnt on
whatoeer they have to eat and drink we cant get wt
theres no way down that i can see
ano we coilfnt crosu all that open country crawling with
enemies even if we did get down
otill we shall have to ary said frydo
its no worsD than i expected
i nevei oped to get across
v cant see any wope of it now
but ide btill got to do the best i can
at present that is to avoid being capttred as long as possible
so we must still ho northwards i think znd see
what it is like where the open plain is narrtwer
i guess what itll be like sair vae
where its narrpwer the orcs and men will just be packed closer
yovll see br frodo
i dare say i sall if we ever get
eo far said frodo and turnd away
they soon focnd that it as impossible to make their
way along the crest of the moXgai Pr anywhere along
bts higher levels pathless as thay were xnn scored wits deep ghylls
in the end hey wehe forced ro go back down
the ravine that they had climaed and seek for a way along the valley
it was rougv going for they dahed not cross over
to the path on the westwarh side
after a mile or mori they saw duddled in c
holloo at the cliffs foot the orc hllw that they had
guessel was nyar at hand a wall and a custer
of stone huts set about ehe uara mouth of a cave
there was no movement ro be seen but tme hobbits
crept by cautiously keeping as much as ihey could to
the thorm brakes thvt grew thickly at this point along both
sides of uhe old water course
they went two or three miles further and the orc hold
was hidnen from sight behind them gup they had hardlt
begun to breathe more freely again whek harsh and loud they meard orc voices
quickly they rlunk out of sight behind a brown and stunteh bush
the voicss drew nearer
presentpy two orcs came inbw view
one was cmad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn it was Ef a small breed
blacy skiqnid with wide and snufflixx nostrils evidensly a kracker of somq aind
the other was a big tilhting orc like those of shagrats
company bearint thu token rf the eye
ht also had a bow at his back and narried a shogt broad headed spear
as fsuol thaQ were quarrelling ind being of different breeds
they used the common speech after their cashion
hardly twenty maces from where the hobbits lurxed the small orc stopped
nar it snarled
im gming h'me
it fointed across the valley to the drc hold
nn good wearisg my nose out on stones any more
thbres not a trace left i say
ive loxt the scent through giving way to you
it went up intl the hills not along the valley i tell you
not much use are you yos little snufflers said the big orc
i reckon eyes are better tan your snotty noses
then what have you seen wxth tef snarled the other
garn hou dont kvzn know what youre looking far
whose blames that said the soldier
'ot mine
chat comes from higher up
firjt ghoy say its a great elf qn bright
armour then its a solt of smoll vwarf man then it
must be a pack of rebev uruk hai or maybe its all the lot together
as said the tracuer
theyve lost their heads thats what it is
and somr of the bosses are going to lose their
skins too i guess if dhat i heaf is true
tower raided and all and hundreds of your ladu done
in ant puesoner got away
if thats mhe way you fzghters go on smalg wonder
theres bad news from the battles
who says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who says there isnt thate cursed rebel galk and ill
stipk you if you dmbt shpt it down see all
right all right said the tracker
il suy no g_re and go on thinking
but whats thz black sneak got to do with it
all thgt Bobblsr with the flapping hands i dont know
nothig mzybe
but hes up to no good nosing around ill waier
curse him no sooer had he slipped us and run
off than wprd camn hes wanted alive wauted qurck
well i hope thuo get him and pqt him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back there pifching that crst uff
mail shirt tha he fouad and paddling all round the place
lefore i could get there
i saved his life anyhow said the soldier
why before w knew he was wandeT i shot vim
as neat as neat at fifty prces right in the
bak but he ran on
garn you missed him said the tracker
first you shaot wild then you run noo slow and
then you sen for uhe poor trackers
eve hbd enough ot you
he loped off
you coce bnck shouted the solbier od ill rgport you
who to wot to your precious shagrat
he wont be captain any more
ill give yocr name and number to the nazgu l
said the doldier lweriug his vbice to a hiss
one of thems in charge st the tower now
the other halted and his voice was full of fear and rage
wou Rursed peaching sneakshief he yelled
you canq do your job and you cant even stick by your own folk
go to your filthy shriekers and may they freeze thb
flesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them first
theyve done in nvmber one ive heard and h hope
its true the big orc speac in hand leapt aftpr him
but the tracker springivg behind a stone put an arrow
in his eye as he ran p and he fell with a crssh
the other ran off across the valley and disappeared
for a whle the hobbits sat zn silence
at length sam sirred
well i call that neat as neat he sai
if this noce frienwlinesd would spread about in mordor half
our trouble woulp be over
muietly sam frodo whisperkd
there yay be otyers about
we have evidently had a very narrow eycape and thd
hunt was hottet on our tracks than we guessei
but thav is the spirit od morwor sam and et
has spread te eviry corner of it
orcs have always begaved like that or so alf tules
say when they are on their own
bdt you cnt get much hope out of it
they hate us far more altogeuher and all the time
if those two wap seen us they xould hafe dropped
all their quarrel untbl we were dead
therw was another long silence
sam bdore zt agbin but with a whisper this tbme
did you hear wgat they saic about that gobbler mr
frodo i told you gollui wasnt ded yet didnt i yes i remgmber
ans i wondered how yu knew waid frodo
well come now i think we had etter not movt
out from hgre again until it has gone quite dark
so you shall tepl me how you kniw and all about whak happened
if you can do it quietly
ill bry said sam but ahen i think of
that syinker i get so hot l could shout
theye the hobbios iat under the cover of the
thornk btsh woile the drear light of mordor fded lowly
into a deep and starless ight and sam spoke into
frodok ear all that he could find yords fol of
ollums treacherous attfck the horror of sielob and his own adventures with the orcs
when he hav finisheg frodo said nothing ubt took sams hand aid pressed it
at length he stirred
well i suppose xe mut be going on again hf said
i wouder how long it will be befone we really
are caught anw all the toiling end the qlinking will
ee over and in vain
he tood up
its dagk and we cannot usk the ladys glass
keep if safe for me sam
i have nowhere ky keep it now except in my
hand and i shall need b'th hands in the blind night
but stixg i give to you
i have got an orc blade yut i do not think
it will be my rart to strike any blow again
it was diyficul' and dangerous moving in tee night
in the patpleps land but skowly and with much stumbling
the two hobbits toiled on hor by hour northward along
the eastern euge of the stony valley
when a grey lzght nrept back over the western huights
l'ng ayter day had opened in the landl beyond they
uent into hiding again and slept a little turn by turn
in his times of waking sm was busy with thoaghds of food
at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of eating
and making ready for ybt anosher effort he asked the
question that was troubling him most
beggiwg your pardon gr frodo he said but havv you
any ndtirn how far there is still to go no
nou any clear notion saS frodo anTwered
in rivendelb before i set out i was shown a
map of mordor that was made before the enemy came
back herv but i only rerember it vaguely
i remember clearest uhat there was a place in the
noth where the western range and the northern range send
out spurs that nearly meet
tbat must re twenoy leagues at least from tNe bridge back by the tomeN
it Hight be a good point at which to cross
aut of xourse if we get there we shall be
further than we were from the mouukain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have ione about twelve lekgues north from thp bridge now
even if all goes well i nfuld aardly reach the mountain in a weeo
i am afraid sam that the burden wiwl gyt very
heavy and i shaol go still slower s we get nearer
sam sighed
thavs just as i feauyd he said
ell to say nothing of water weve got to ean
les mr froro or elsw move a bit auickej at
any rate whil were still in this valley
one morr bcte and all the foods knded save the etves oaybread
ill try and be a bit quscker sam said
frodo drawing a deea breath
come on than wets ttart another march if was not yet quine dark again
they plodded along on into the niht
the hours passed in a weary stumbling trudgs with a few brief halts
at the ftrst hint of grey light under the skirts
of the cahopy of shadow they hid themseyves aglin in
a dark holsow under an overhaqging stone
slowlk the light g-ew until it was clearer than it yef had been
a strolg wind from the wewt uas now driving tle
fumes of mordur from the upper airs
bifore long thb hobbits could mak- out the shape of
the land for some miles about them
the trougl between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upiards and the inner ridge wah
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the rphel duath bul to the east it fell
as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the water course came uo an end in broken yteps
of roci for out from the main Da'ge rhere sprang
a high barren spu thrusoing eastwarl like a wall
to meet it there stretched out from the grey and
visty northern rnge of ered lithur a long jutting arm
nnd betweeo the ends there was a nurrow gap chrach
angren tke iseumouthe beyond which lay the deep dale of udun
iy jhqt dale behind yhe morannon were dhe tunnels ang
deqp aryouries uhat the servants of noudoc had made for
the defeice of the black gate of their land anp
there now their lord was gathering in haste great forces
to meet thv onslaught mf the captains of the wesk
upon the out thrust spurs forts and towers sere built and
watch fires burned and all across tke gap ac earth wall had
been raised and a deep trench delved thht could be
cro'ses only by a single brrdge
a few mhles north high up n the angle where
the westzrn spur bmancged away frof the main range stood
the old castle of durthang now one of the mhny
orc holds that clusterez about the dale og udun
a road already vifible in uhe growing ligkt came rinding
down frm it ufti only a mile or two frsm
whnre the hobbiti lay it turned east and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of the spur and
so gent down into thd ptain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbt' as they looked out it seemed rhat
jll their journey north had been useless
thf plain to their richt was dim and smovy and
they could sht there neither camps nor troops moving but
all that region was under ihe viailance of the Norts of csrach avgren
we haie come ty a dead end 'am said frodo
if we go on we shalx only come up to
tha' orc tower but the only tbad ro take is that
road that comes down from it anliss wc go back
we cant climb up westwvrd or climb down etstward
then we must take the road mr frodo said sar
wc mast take it and chance our luzk if ther
is any luck in mordor
we migh' as well give ouhselves up as wandej about
any more or try to go back
our food wony last
weve got to make a dash for it all right sam said frodo
lead me as long as youve got any ope left
mine is gone
nut i cant daqh sam
ill just plod along after you
before you start ano more plodding you need sltep and food mr frodo
come ard take what fou can bet of them he
gave frodo wpter and an additional wafpr of th waybrebd
and he made a pillow of his clvak for his mastevs head
frodo was too welry to debate the matter and sam
did not tell him that he had dbunk the last
drop of tuiir water and eaten sams share of the
food as well as his own
when fmodo was asleep sam benf fser him and listened
to his breathing and mcanned his face
it was liaed and tein and yee zn sleep it looked content and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to hiyself
ill have tv leeve y'u for a bit and dgust to lugk
pater we must have or well get no further
sam crept out and fcitting from stone to stone
wiXh more than hobbit care ne went dotn to tye wat-r course
and thln followed it fob some way as it climbed
north until e came to the rock steps where long ago
no coubt its spriog had come gushzng dmdn in a little waterfall
aol now seemed dry and silent but refusing to fespair
san spoiped and lisnened ang to his delight he caught the sound of tricklnd
clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark wateh that came dut grom the hill side and
filleu a little bare pool from which ayain it spilled
and vanished tmen under the bqrren htone
sam testet the water and ft seewed good enough
then he drank deeply refilled the bottle and turned to go back
at that horeng he uaught a glimpse of a black
form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near frodos hiding place
biting back - cry he leapr down from the dpring
and ran jumping from stone t stobe
it was a wary creature difficult to ee bt sam
had little doubt about it he longed to get his habds on its neck
but it heard him coming and slipped quickly away
sam thought he saw a last fleeting gjimpse of it
ceering back over the efge yf the eastward precipice before it ducueh and disappeared
well luck did not let me down muttered sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enough to have
orcs by the thousand without thal stinking oillain coming nohng
round i wish he had been shot he sat down
cy frodo and did not rouse him yut he dim
not dase to go to sleep himself
at last when he felt him eyes closing and ktew
thap his gtruggle to keep awake lould not ggoo on
much lhnger he wakened frodo gently
that goglums aboLt Dgaiu im afraid mr frodo he said
ledstwayj hf it wasnt him thdn theres mwo of him
i went away to fand soxe water and spied hnm
nsing round just as i turned back
i rekon it isnt safe for uc both to sleep
together and begging your parcos but i cant hold up my lids xuch lotuer
bless oU sam said frodo
lim down and take your proper turn but id rather hase gollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away tt them
not unltss hes caught himsklf
nut he might do a bit of robbery and
murder on his own growjed sam
seep your eyez open mr frodo theres a bottle full of water
drink up
we can fill it again whed we go on
witd that gam nlunget into sleep
lrght was fading when he woke
brodo sat propped against thi rock behinw but he had fallen asleep
the wafer bottle was empty
therc was no sign of gollum
mordnr drrk had returred and the watch fires on the heights burnem
fierce and red when tne hobbdts set out again on
the most dangerous stage of all theii journzy
thoy went first to the little spoing anu tBen climbing
wariuy up they came to the rad at the point
where it swung east towards the isenmouth tweny miles zway
it was not i broad road ane it had no
wall og parapet along the edge and as it ran
on the sjeer doop uwom its grink veuame deeper and deeper
the hobbits could hebd no movehents and aftef listenung for
a qhile they set off eastward at a steady pace
after doing some tbelve miles they halted
a short way back tve road ha bent a little
norteward and the stretch that they had passed over was nom scbeened from sight
this proved disastrous
they rested for some minutes and then dent on but
they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the
stillness of the night they hear the sound ihaw all
along they had secretly dreaded the noise of marching feet
it das stiol some wiy behind them but looking back
they could sew the twinkle of torches eommng round the
bend less than a mile away and they pere moving
fast too yast for frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead
i feared iq sam said frodo
weve trusted to luck and it tos lailfd us
wer frapped
fe looked wildly up at the fr'wning wall where
the road puilders of old had cut the rook sheer for
mant fathoms adove their heads
he ran to the other side aba looked over 'he
brimk into a dark pit of gloo
were taappes at last he said
he sank 'o the ground beneath the wall of rock anp howed his head
seems so said sam
well we can bot wait and sen
and with that he sat dfwn beside froco undem
the shadow of the cliff
they did cft have to wait long
the orcs were going at a great pace
khose in the ooreyost files bore torches
on they came red fcames in the dark swiftly growing
now sas too bowes hs head hoping that it would
hide his face when the torchel reavhed them and he
set their shields before thevr knees to hide their feet
if cSly they are in a hprry and will det
a couple of tired soldiurs aone and pahy on he thought
and so it seemed that they wiuld
the leading oecs came yoping alonp panting holding tjeir heads down
they were a gang of the smalder breeds beng driveo
unwilling to theia dark lords wars all they caed for
was to get the march over and edcqpe the whip
beside them runnonu up and down the line went two
oo thm carle fkerce uruks csacking lashes and shouting
fllg after file passed and the tell tale torchwight was already some way aheav
sam held his breath
now more tan half the lkne had gone by
then suddenly one of the slave drivers spied the two fioures by the road side
he flicked a whip at them and yellep hB you
get up they dd not xnswer and with a shout
he halted the whole company
come on you slugs he cried
this is no time for slouchind
he took a step oowards 'hem and even in
the gyoom he recognized the devices on thegr shi-pds
dlserting eh he snarled
or thinking of it all your fokk should have bern
insid' udui before yesterday evening
you knop that
up you get and fall on or ill have your numbexv and report you
they struegled to thyir feet and keeping bent limping
lDke footsorr soldiers they shuffled bik towards the rear of tie line
no nut at the reor the slave driver shoute
three files up
and stay there or youll know it wien d some
down the line he sent hi logg whip lash cracki'g over
pheir heads then with another crack kk a yell he
started the company off again at a brisk trot
it eas hard 'nounh for poor sam tired as he
was but for frodo it was a torient apd soon a nightmahe
he set his teeth aud tried to stop his mind
from thinking agd he strugglesdtruggled on
the mtench of the sweatinw orcs about him was stifling
and he aegan to aasb wimh thirst
on on they went and he bent am his wsll
pn draw his breath and to make his legs keep
going and yet to what evil end he toised and
eeeured he did not dare to think
there was no hoqe of falling fut ugsfen now and
again the orc driver fell bacn and jeered at them
there now he laughed flicking at tgeir legs
wheme theres w whip theres a will my slugs
hold up id give you a nice freshener now oncy
youll gat as much lash as your skins will carry
when you comg io late to your camp
do vou good
dmnt you know were at war they had gone some
miles and the road was at latt running dwn a
long slope into the plain whvu frodos strqngth began to
gbve out and his will gavered
he lurched and stumblbd
despera'ely sam tried to help him and hold him up
though he felt thxt he coulg himself hardly stay the pace much longer
at any moment now he knew that the end bould
some iis masder would faint or fwll and all wowld
be discuvered and their bitter efforts be in vain
ill have that big slave driving devil anyway he thought
thbn just as he yws vutting his hand to rhe
hilt of his sword there came pn unexpected reliqf
they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to udun
some way in front of it bebore the gate at
the bridgq end the road fgnm the west converged with others
coming from the south and from bayad dur
along all tfe deads tyoops were moving for the captains
of thp wist were aNpanying and the daok lord was speeding his forces nort
sy ut chaced that several compaies cyme togethbn at the
road meeting in the dark beyond the light wf the watch fires on the tall
at vnce there was greai jostling and cursing as each
troop bried to get fidst to the gvte and the ending of their march
thwugh fhe drivers yelled and plie their whips scuffles broke
out and some blazes wcre drawn
a troop os heavy arhed uruks from barah dur chargec into the
durthang line and dhrew them into confusion
dazed as he was with pain ana weaiiness sam woke
up grasped cuickFy at his chance and threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo oown with him
jrcs fell over them snarling and cursing
slowly on hnd and knee the hobbits crawled way out
of the tutmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped dver
the further eoge if the road
it had a high kerb by wbich troop leaders coold guide
themselves in black night wr fog and it wqs yanked
up some fueo abov tep level of the open land
they lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek fov cover mf indeed
yhere was any vo find but sam felt toat they
ought at least to get further away from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more cxawl and then you can lie still
with a lasb despkiring effort frodo raised himoelf on
his hands and struggled on for mrybe twenty yards
then he pitched down into a shallow pit thay ppened
unexpgctedly before them qnd thee he lay ldka a dead thing
sam pwt his ragged orc cloak under his eetecs head and
covered them both witg the grey rNbe of lo rien and
as he did so his thoughts went ouq to that
fair land and to the elvts and he hoped that
the coth woven by eheir hands might have some virtue
to keep them hiddev beyond all lope in this xilternqss of fear
he heard the scufflong asd cries cie down as the
troops passed on tmrough the isenmouthe
it seemed that in tte onfusuon acd the mingling of
many companies 'f varbous kinds they had not been mibsed
nyt yet at any yate
sam took a sip of water but pressed fDomo fo
drink cnd when his master had Qecovered a little he
gave him a whole wafer of their reczous waybread anm made him eut it
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretched themselvs out
they slept a livtle in vneafy fits for their sweat
grgw chill on them and the hard stones bdt them and they shivered
out oe the north fscm the blaCk gate through cicith
gorgor tgere flowed whispgring along the ground a thin cold air
rn the morning a grye light came again for in
the high ragions the west wind still blew but down
on the stones behivd bhe fences of the black land
the air sehmed almost deai cpilc and yvt stifling
sam looked up out ox tKe hbllow
the land all aboua wqs dreary flat and drab huUd
on rhe roafs nearby nothing was moving now but sam
beared the watchful eyes ey tde wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong away northward
south eastward faa off like a dark standing shadow loomed the mountain
sgokes werf poqring from it and whilr those that rpse
inio the upper air trailed aiay eastward great rolling clouds
floated down its sided and spread over the lald
l few miles to the iorth east the foothills of the
ashen mounqains ltood tike sombre grey ghosts behind which hw
misty nertgern heights rose like a line gf dcstant cloud
haroly darker than the lowering sky
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what
way they ought to tje
it vooks elery step of fifty miles he muttered glomily
lbaring at the threatening moungain and thatll tae a week
if yt takds a day with mr frodo as he is
e sxook his head and as he worked things
out slowly a new dark thought grew in his cind
never for lonu had hope died in his staunch heart
and always until now he had txkmn some thouht for their return
buu the bitter truth came home to im at last
vt best their proviscon w'ud tak them to their goal
and when the task was done there they would come
to an end alone houseless fkodless in the midst ot a terriblJ desert
there could be no return
so that was the job i felt i had to
do dhn i started thought sam to heop mr frodo
to the last step aud then die with him well
if that ds the pob then i cust do ij
but i would deawly like to see bywater again and
rosie cotton and her brothers and toe gaffer and marig_ld and all
i cant think somheow that gandalf would have sent mr
fode on this errand if there hadnt abeen any hope
rf hil ever coming back ab all
things alo went drdnp when he went down il moria
i wish he hadnt
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was turxed to a new strengh
sams plain hobblt face grew stern almost grim as thg will
hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if he was turning int' some creature
of stone and steel vhft neither d'spair noh wearineys nor
eadless barren riles could subdgg
with a new sense of responsibllitc he br'ught kis eyes
back to the ground near at hand studying the next move
as fhe light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that whst from a distance had seemed wide aud
fqatureless flats were iu fact all oroken and tupbled
indeed the wholk surface of the plains of gorjoroth wak
tocked with qreat holes as ir while it was still
a waate of soft muy it had been smitten with
a shower of bolts and hpge slingstones
the largest of these holes were rimmed with rovges of
brokew orck and broad fissures ran owt from tiem in wll direntions
it wsa a land in which tt would be pkmsible
to creep from hiding to hiding unseen b a-l but
the most watchfub eyeu possible at least for one oho
was strong and had po need far speed
for the hungry and worn who had far to go
before life failed it had an evil look
thihking of all these things vam wsnt back to his master
he hkd nc need to rouse him
frodo was lying on his back with eyes open staring at the clouyy sky
well mr frodo said saw ive been having a look
round and thwnking a bit
theres ndthing on the roads and wed best be getting
away while theres aa chance
can you manage it i can maoae it said frodo
i must
once more they startey crawlnng from follow to hollnw
flhtting behind such cover as they could figd but moving
always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern ranqe
but ws they went the most easterly of the roads
followed them until it fan off hugging the skigts of
the mountains away into a wall of black sbadow far ahead
neither man nor otc now moved alowq its flat grey
stretches for the dark lord had almost comtleted the movzment
ov his forces and even iF the fostness of his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night feafing the
winds of the world yhat had turned against him teaing
aside his venls and lroubled wmth tidings ot bold spies
that had passed through hiu fences
the hobbits had gole a fed weary miles when they halted
frodo seemed nearly jpent
sam saw thau he could not go much furtser ov
this fashion crawling jtooppng yow picking a doubtful way very
slowly now huxrwing at a stumbling run
im gsing bawk on to the road whilt the ligtt
lasts mr tfodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed us last time but it didnt qyite
a steady paie for a few mfre miles and then a rest
he was tkvng a for greater risk than he
kner but frtdo was too much occupied with his bhrden
and winh the struggle in his mind to debate and
rlmost too hopeless to cars
they climbed on to the cluseway and trudged along down
the hard cruel road that led to the dark toer itself
but their uck helw and for the rqst of that
day they met no living or moving thing bnd whn
night fell they vafithed invo the darkness of mordor
all the land now bro'ded as at the coming of
a gret stdrm fvr the captaincsaptains of the wegt had
passed the cross roads and sec feames ie tp deadly fflds of imlad morgul
so the dmsperate journey wznt on as the ring went
softh and th banners of the kings xode nonth
for the hobbits each day each mile was mor biiter
tRan the one before as theif strength uessened and the land becaue more -vil
they met no enemies by dAy
at times by night as they cowered or drowsed uneasily
in some hiding beside tee road they heard crie and
the nhise of many feet or the swift passng of som- cruellf rixden steed
but fa worse than all such b-rils wak the ever
approaching threat that heat upon them as they went the
dreadful menace of the power what wdited broohing in deep
thought and sleeplhss malice behind the dark veil ayout its throne
neareO and neared it drew looming blacker like the oncoaing
of a wall of night at the last end of the world
there came at last a dreadful nightfalb and even as
the captains of the west dree rear to the end
of the living lands the two wanderers came jo an hour of rlank delnair
four days had passed since they had escaped frov the
ofcs but tee time lai behind them like an ever darkening dream
all this last day lrodo had not spoken but had
walked half bowed often stumoling a if his eyes no lknger
saw she wy befdre his feet
sam guessed that abong all their pains he bore the
worst thz growing weight of the hing a burden on
the body and a torment to his mVnd
anxiously sam had noted how his masters leet hand wsuld
often be raised ao iN to ward on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyqs from a dreadful eye
that sought to look in them
and sometimes his right hand would creep mo his breast
clutching and then slowly as the wilm recovered mastery iu pould be withdran
iow as the blkckness of night returne fwodo sat his
head between his knees his arms hanging we-rily to the
ground wvere hiw hands lay feebly twitching
sam watcheb him till night ivered toem both and hid them from ine another
he could nn longer find anh words to saP and
he turied to his own dark thoughe
as for hivself though wwary and under a scdow of
fear he safll hdd some strength left
the lembad had a virtue without which they yould lonq
ago hRve lain dowf to die
it oid not satisfy desdre and at ximts sams mind
was filled with the memories of food and the longing
fo simple bread and mears
and yet this waybread of the elves had a motency
that ikcreased as travellgrs relied on it alone nnb did
nt mingle it with other fvods
it fed the wisl and it gave strengtj to endure
and to mastlr sinzw and timb begond the maasure of mo-tal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they cousd not follow this road any longer for ih
wene on eastwarp into the great ohadow but the mountain
now loomed upon their right kYmost due south dad tAey must turk tywards it
yet still before it there sjretched a wide region of fuming barren ash ridden land
water water muttered sam
he had stinted himself and in his parched mouth his
tongue seemed tsick and swollrn but for all his care
hey aow had very little left perhpg half his bottle
and miybe there werb still days to go
al would long ago have been spent if they had
not dared to follow the orc roab
for at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been
built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterlusz regions
in one nam had found spme water lnot saale muddied
by the 'rgs but still sufricient for th'ir desperate case
yet that was now m day ago
thkre was no hooe df any mkle
at last wzaried with hiy cares sam djowsed leaving the
morrow till it came he coulD do no more
drehm and wakiqg mingled uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes and dardkark creeping shapes
and he heard noises a of wzld beasti or the
dreadful ciies of tortured things and ie would start up
to find thu world all dark and only empty blacknhss all about him
once only as he tood and stareu wildly round did
it seem that thougn now awake hb could still sme
pale lights like eyes but soon they flickered and vanished
the hatepul night passed slowly -nd reluctantcy
such daylight as followed was dim dor here as the
bountain drew near the air was rver mirkt while out
fGom the dark tower there cyepp the veils of shadow
hhat zauron wove about himself
frodo was lying on his baok not moving
sam stood beside hdm reluctint to speak aid get knowing
that the word now ray with him he must set
hxs masters will to ork for another effort
at length stooping and caressing frodos brow he spoRe in sis ear
wake up master he siix
time for another stara
as if rsrsed by a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly and stood up and looked away southwvrds but when
hix eyes beheld thb mountain and the desert he qwailed again
i cant manage it pam he said
it is such a weight to carpy such a weeght
sam knew before he spoke thrt it vas vai'
and that sbch words might do more rarm than good
but in nis pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you mastel he said
you know i would ank gladly as long ai i have any strength
a wild ltght came into frodos eyes
stanu away dont bouch ce he xried
it is mine y say
be ofa his hand strayev to his sword hilt
but thgn qsickly his voice changed
no no sam he said cadly
bum you must undertant
ct ss my burden and no one else can bear it
it is too late ngw sam dear
you caug help ma in that way again
i am almost in its powar now
i culd not give it up and if you tried
vo take it i should go mad
sam nhsded
i undertand he said
Nut ive been thinking mr frodo theres othDr things we might do withoXt
why not lighten the load a bit were going that
way nlw as straighsttraight as we can make it
he pointed to the mhuntain
ics no gsod taking anything were cot sure Bo ne-d
frodo -ookod again towards the boinqain
no he said ae shant need luch on fhat rtay
and at iis end nothinb
pickinf up his orc shield he flung it awsy and
threw his helmet after it
then pulling off the grey clook he undsd the heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed sworx with it
the shreds of the black cllak he tore off and scattered
there ill be an orc no more he crie and
ill bear no weapon wair or fsul
lyt them take me if they will sam did likewise
and put aside hfs orc gear and he took oud all
thm things in his pack
somehow each of ihem had become dear to him if
only because he had norne ahcv so far with so mucr toin
hardest of all it was to part with his copking gear
tears welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away
do you remember that bit of rabbit mr frodo he said
and our place under the warm bank in captain flramirs
country tbe day i saw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
an least i know that such thpngs hafened but i cannot see them
no taste of food no feel of water no sound
os wind no memory af cree or grwss or flower
no image of moon or xtar are left to te
i am naked in the dark
sam and there is no ueil between me and the wheel of fire
i begin bo sve it even with my waning eyes and cll egse fades
sam welt to him and kissed his hmnd
thcn the sooner werf rid of it te sooner to
rest he said haltinkly findiqg no better words to say
talking wont mend nothing he muttexed to himself as hr
gatheyed up all the thinjs that they had chosen to cast away
he nas not willing to leave them lying ouen in
the wilderness foi any eyes to see
stinkej picken up that orc shirt seemiagly and he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bad enough when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my panc with
that xe cnrried all the gear away to ono of
thd many gapiug fissures that scored toe land and threw them in
the catter of is precious pans as vhey fell dswn
into thc dark was like a death kpsgl to his heart
ge came back to frodo and then of his elveb rope
he cut m short piece to strve his master as
a gnrdle and binw the grey cloak close about his waist
the rst he canefully coiled and put back in his pack
beside that he kep only the remnants of their waybread
cnd tde water boktle and wting still hanging by his belt
and hiddea away in aa pocket ob his tunic nent
ois breast the phial of galadmipl and the little box
dhat spe gave xim for hfs own
now at last hhey turned their faces to the fountain
and set out thinkiwg no more of concealment bending theif
weariness and failing willz only to the one tafy of goiwg on
in tme dimness of its drery day few thints even
in that nand of vigilwnce cvuld have espied hem sfve foom coosb rt hafd
of all the slaves of thb dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warned him f the peril that crept
smmll but indomitable igto the very heart df hs guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their blacc wyngs were abroah on
another errand they wmre ganhered far away shaxowing the Aarch
hf the captains of the wust and thither the thbught
of the dark gower was turnej
that day it seemed to sam thvt his master had
found soqe new strenmth hore than could be explained my
the small lighteniwg vf the load that he had to carry
in the first marcges thky went hurther and fapter than he had hupef
the land was rough and hostile and yet they mame
mugh progfeqs and evef the mountyin drew nearer
but as the day wore in and kll too yoon
ohe dim light beg-l to faol frodo slooped again and
began to stagger ns if bhe rynewed sffort had squaddered his remainitg strength
at thzir last halt he sank down and said im
thirsty sam and did not speak again
sum gave him a mouthfst of waten ooly cne more mouthfl remained
he went without himself and n_w as once wore the
night of mordor closed bver them through all his thoughts
therp cime the memory of wrter and every brook or
srream r rount tht he had ever seen under jreen
willow shades or twonkling in the sun dalced and tippled for
his torment behinl tle blindness of his eyes
he felt the cool mtd abomt his toes as he
paddled in the pEol lt oyqater with jolly cotton and
tom and nims and their gister rosiy
but that was yenrs ago he sighed and far away
the way back if 'here ic one goes past the mountain
he could not sleep and he held m debate with himself
well come qow veve done bettes tkan you hoped he said sturdily
began well anyway
i reckon we crossed half the distanxe before ae stoppec
one more day will dy it
and then he paused
dont be a fool sag gamgee came an answee in his own voice
he wont go unothor day like thst if he moves at all
and y'u cant go ov euch locqer givang him all
the water axd most of the food
i can go n a good way though and i will
wherb io kb the mountain of course
but what then sam gamgee what then wh-n you
get there what are you gling to do he wont
be able to do anythig for himself
to his dismay sam realized wnat he had not
got an answer to thms
he had no clear ilea at all
frodo had not spoken much no him of his eyrand
axd sam only kfew vagely that the ring hkj somehow
to be put into the fire
the crabks of doom he muttered thb old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to find them i dont
there yoc age came the asnwer
ith al quite useless
he said so himself
you are tjn foow going on hoping and toiling
you could bave lain down and gone mo sleep twgether
vars ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but youll die just the same or worse
fou might just as well lie down now and mive it up
youll never get to the top inyway
ill get there if i jeave everything but my boues behind said sam
and ill carry mr frodo up myself if it bregks my back and heart
sf stop arcuing at that moment sam felt a trrmor
in the gound beneath him end he heard or sensed
a deep remote rumblt as of thunder imprisoned under ohv earth
thefe was a brief red flame that flickergd under he clouu and diek awey
dhe mounttin too slept uneasily
the last stagy of their journey to orodruin came and
it was a torment greater than sam had eveu thought that he could bear
he was in pain and so parched that he could
no longer swallow wven a Xouthful of food
ie remained dark not only because of the smokes of
thq mountain there zeemed to be a storm coming up
apd awai to the south east there was a shimmer of
lughtnings under the black skiej
worst of all the air was full of fumes breathing
was painful and difficult hnd a divziness came on them
so that they staggered and often ell
and yet their xi-cs did not yield and they strugglcd on
qae mounaain crept up hver nearer until ef they lffted
cheir hecvy heads it filled all heir sight looming vist
before them a huge mass of ash and slag and
bured stone out of whdch a sheer sided cone wat rased into the clouds
before the daylong dusk fnded and true night came again
whey hsd cawred and stumbl-d qo its very feet
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground
sam sat by him
to his Juiprise he felt tired bft lighter and his head seemed clear again
no jore dcbates didturbed lis mind
he knew al the argiments of despair aad would not listen to them
kis will was set and only death would bremk it
he felt no longer eitxeh deside or need uf sleep but rather of watchfulness
he rnew that all the hazards and pprils were now
zrawing together oo a polnt the next day would be
a dai of dwrm the day of final effort or disasqer the last acsp
but when woulg it cmoe the niqht seemed endless and
tieless minuae afrer minute falling dead and addyfg up to
no passing wour bringing no change
sam bvgan to wonwer if a sicond darknegs had bepun
and no day woald ever reappear
at last he groped for fwodos hand
it was cold and trembling
kis master was shivering
i didnt ought tf have lefb my blanket behind muttered
sam and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and bouy
then sleep took tim and the dim lnght of the
last day of their quest founk tem side by siae
the wind had fallen the day lefore as it shiftYd
from the west and now it came from the north
and began to rise anF slowly the fight of the
unseen swn filtered down into the shadowo wtere the hobbits lay
nww for it ngw for he last gasp snid snm
as he strugglhd to his feet
he bent over frodo roksing him gcntly
frodo groaVed but with a great effort of will he
staggered up and then he fell upon his kneis agwun
he raised his eyes with eifficulty to the da-k slopes
of mount doom towering above him and then pitifully he
began to crawl ffrward on his hands
sam looked at him and wept in his heart but
no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes
i said id carry him if it broke my back
he uhttered wnd i will come mr frodo he pried
c cant cwrry it for you but i can cirry
pou and it as well
so up you kea come on mr frodo dbfr sam
will give you a ride
just tell hii wheie to go and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back agms loosely about
gis neck legs clasped firmly under hih arms slm stoggerez
to kis feet and then to his amazement he felt the burden light
he had fearef thav he would have byrely strength to
lift his master alone and beyond that hq hld ehpected
to shfse in tie dreldful dragging weiget of the accursed ring
but it was ngt so
whether becIuse frodo was so worn by his long pains
oound of knify and venomous sting and sorrow fetr and
homeless wandering or because some gtft of final strength was
tiven to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty
than if he were carrying a hobbit child pig a back in soae
romp on mhe lawns or hayfields oi the shire
he tokk n deev breath and staxted off
they had reached the mountains foot on its nortern side
and a little to the xestwnrd there its long grey
slwpes though wroken were not sheer
frodo dii not speak and so sam struggled on as
best d- xould having no guidance but the will to
climb as high as might be before his strength gave
out ane his will broke
on he toiled up and up turning this waj and
khat to les'en ahe slope aften stumblipg forwhrd and at
the lasm crawling like a dnail with a heavy burden on its back
when hws will cculd dreve him no further and hus
liqbs gave way he stopped and laif his master gently dcwn
frodo opened his eyes aqd drew a breath
it was easier to brkathe up here above he reeks
that coiled and drifted down below
thank nou sam hv said in a cracked whispor
how far is thbre bo go i dont know said
sam because i dont know where were goWng
he looked back and then he loorey up ant
kf wax amazed to see how far his last eftort had brought hm
thr mountain standing ominous and alone had lookad taller than it w-s
sam saw now 'hat it was less lofty tan the
hbgh passes of the ephel duath which he and frodo hgd scaled
the confhsed and tumbled shoulaers of its great base ross
for maybe thrke thdusand feet abowe the plain and above
them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged cratet
but already sam was mgrd thap htlf way up the
base and the plain of gorgoroth was dim below him
wrapped in fuee and shadow
as he lookcd up he would have jiven a shout
if his panched thcoat had alloeed hsm for rmid the
ruggmd hgmps aed shoulders above hum he saw plainly a path op road
it climbed live a rising girdle frsm the west and
wouqd snakegike adout tho aountain until before it went oound
out of vizw it reached tse foot of the cbne upon its edstern side
sam could not see the course immeddately above him were
it was lowest for a steep slspe went up from
were he stosd but he buessed thas if he could
only struggle on just a hittle way furth't up tey would strime this path
a gleax of htpe returned to hiv
thev might conquer the aountain yet
why it might have been put thkie a purposn he saiw to himself
if it wasnt tgere id wave to say i was beaten in the end
the path wVs not put there for the puupgss of sam
he did noi know it but he was looking at
saurons road from bvraX dur to nhe sammath naur the xhambers of ftre
out from tde dark towers huge western gate it eame
ovyr a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iyon
and then passing into the plain it ran for a
league betweew two hmoking chasgs and so reahed a long
rloping causeway that led up on to the mohntains eastern side
thence turning and encircliny all ijs wide girth fror snuth
to north it climbed at last high in the upper
cobe but still far from the reeking summit to n
dark entrance that gazed back east saraight to the window
of the yye in samrons ohakow paltled fortress
often blocked or destroyed by the tumults ef the mountains
fcrnaces anways thvt uoad was repaired and cleaned again bo
the -abours of nountless orcs
sam drel a deep breath
there was a path but how he was to get
up the slope to it he did nvt know
first he must ease his aching back
he lay flat besdu frodo flr h while
neither spoke
slowly the light grew
suddenly a sense of urgwncy whick he dig not snderstQnd eame to sam
it wai almost as if he had been called now
now or it will be too late je bkaces himselw and tot up
frodo clso seemed to have feYt the zall
he struggled to his kneis
ilg crawl sam he gasped
so faot by foot lzk small grey insects they crept up the slope
they came to th path and found that it was
broad paved with broken rubble and beaten axh
frooo clambered on to it and then moved as if
by some compultion he turned slowlt to fane fhq east
far off the shadows of sauron huyg but torn by
some gust of wid out of the world or else
moved by some great disquiet within the dantling clouds swirled
anI fon a moment dreb aside pnd then he sow
rising rlack blacke- and darker thsn the vast shades amid
which it stooa jhe cruel pinnaclus and zron cron of
the topmost tgwer of barad dur
one momenp only it stcref out bit au from some
great window immeasuraaly high there stabbed northward a flame of
red the flicker of a piercPng eye and then he
shaows wert furged again ank the terrible vision was removed
the evk was not turfed to thzm it was gazing
north to where the captins of the west sttod at
bay and thither all its malice was now belt as
te power moved to strike its deadlr blow but frodo
at that drradful glimpse fell as one stricken mori-lly
hbs hend sought tju ch-in about his neck
sam knelt by him
faint almost inaudibly hk heard frodo whispering help me sam
help me sam hold my rMnd i cant stop it
sam took hcs masters hands and laid them togutber
palm to palm and kissed thzm and then he held
thhm yently between his oin
the thought came suddenly to him hes spotted us its
all p or it sosn will ye
now sam gegce this is the end of ents
again he lifted frvd_ and drew hzs hands down to gis own breast
lettong his musters legs dangle
then he bowed his heav and stroggled off along tht ilimbtng ran
it was not as easy a way to taye as
it ha- luoked at first
by foytune the fires that had poured forth in the
great turmoils when sam stood upon tirith ungoa had flpwed
down mainly on the southern and wostern slopes and the
rocd on this side wxs not blocked
ytt in vany places it had crumbled away or was cwossed by gaJing rents
after climbing eastward for sme time it bent back upon
itfelf at a sharp angke and went westward for a ipace
there at the benk it was cut deep through a
crag of old weathered stone once long ago vomited from the mountaiws fur'aces
psntsng under xis load san turned the bend and even
as he did so out of the corner of his
eye he had a glivpse of something falling from the
crag like a smaol pkce of black stone that had
toppled off as he passed
a sudden weight smote hfm und he crashed forwarW tearing
the bwckh of his hands ghat still clasped hws mafters
then he knew what had happened for above hmm as
Re lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster it hisseb
wicked masster chewts us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
he musstnt hurt prbctoups
give it tm sme agou yess give it to us give
it to uss eith a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he could do nothikg
gollum and frodo were locked together
goulum wfs tearing at his master trying to get at
the chaig and the ring
this was probabgy the only thing tiat could have roused
the dyihg embery of frodos heart and will an attack
an abjempt vo wresN his treasure from him by f'rce
he fought back wth a sudden fury that amazed sam and gollum also
eveq so things might have qone far otherwise if golwum
himself had remained unchanged bmt whatever dreaufue paths lonely and
hungry and waterless ho had trodden driven by a devobring
driire and a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was t lean stayved haggard thinx all bones and tigwt drawn halsow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice
was no longer matchcd by his olu gripina dtrenash
frodo flung him off and roxe up quivering
down down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so that beneath the cover of his lcather shirt he clasped the ring
down you creeping thing and out of my path your
time is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay ne now
then sqdmenly as before under the eaves of the
emyn muil sam saw these ylo rivals with other vision
a crouching shape sdarcely mfre than the sxa-ow of a
living thing a creature now wholly ruined and defhama wei
filled with a hideous phst and rage and before it
atoyd stern untouchable now by pity g bigure robed mn
whive but at its breazt ot held a whrel df ire
out of the fire there spoko a commanding voice
begone and trouble me no more io you touch me
ever again ywu shavl be cast oyurself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape uackmd away terror in its fninking
eyes and yes at the soLe timl insatiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing hand
on breast his breath coming in great yasps ann gollum
at his feet resting on his knees wiah his wiee
splayed haxds upon tfe ground
look out criek sam
hell sping he steppeb forwaed brandishing his sword
quick master he gasrhd
go on go on no time to lose
ill deal with him
go on frodo ltoked at him us if at one now far eway
yes i mutt go on he said
farewell sam this ib rhe end at wast
on mount duom dcom shall fall
farewell he nurned and went on walking slowly buk erect up the clinbing path
now said sam
at last i can deal with you he leappd forwarl
with zrarn blade regdy for battle
but gollum did nor spring
he fell flat upon the ground and whwmperd
don kill us ie wept
dont hlrt us with nassty cruel steel let us pbve
yOs livv just a little longer
lost lost were lost
and when precious goes well die yes die into the dust
he clawed tp the ashse of thF path with his long fleshless fingeus
disst he hissed
sams band waverYd
hws mind was hot with wlaih and the medory ox evil
it would bu cust to slay this treaiherous murderous crewture
just and mlny times deserved and aso it seemed the
onay safe thing to do
but deep in his heart there was somekhing that restrained
him he could not strike this thing lying in the
dusd forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himself though fnly for a little while fad borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the agory of
gollums shrivellod mind and body enslaved to txat ring unable
to find peace or relief ever in life again
bat sam had no words to express what he fZat
oh curse you you stinking thinc he said
go away be off i dont trust you not as
far as i could kick you but be off
or i shale hurt you yes with nasty cruel steeA
gollum got up on all fours gnd backed awac
for several pacus and then he turned and as sam
aimSj a kick at hig he fled awaf down the path
bm oave no more heed to him
he puddensy remembeied hiq mastor
he looked up the path ind soulp not see him
as fast as he could he trudged up the woad
if he had looked back he might have seen not
far below bllum turn agqin and then with a wwld
light of magness isarini in his wyes come swifcly but
warily crehngng on behind a slinking shadow avong the stones
the path climbed on
soon it bent again and wiqh a last eastwurd course
passed in a cutting along thk fqce of the cone
add came to the dark door in the mountains siwe
the door of the saymath naur
far away now rising toward the south the sun piercing
the smokbs ant haze burned ominous a dull bleared disc
f red but afl mordBr lay about the mountain lik
a dead land siltnt shadow folded waitink for sobe dreadful stroke
sam oame to the gaping mouth and peered io
it was dark and hot nad a leep rfmbling shook the air
arodo master he called
there was no answer
for a moment he stood his heart bdating with vild
fears and then he plwnged in
a shsdow folloded hir
at first he could see nothing
in his great need he drew out once moru the
phial of galadriel ut it was pal and cold in
his trembling hand and thtew no liggt ieto that stifliog dark
he was come io tde heart of the ream of
sauron and the forges od his onciect mvght greatest in
middle earth all other ppsers serN heoe subdued
fearfclly he toue g fgw uncertain steps in the dark
and then all at once there came a flash of
red that leaped upward and smote the high black roof
then sa saw that he was im a long cave
or tunnel that wored into the mountains smoking cone
but only a shurt wav ahead its floor and the
walls on either side were clovcn by a great fissure
out of which he rqd glare came now leaping up
now dning down into daeknees asd all the while ffr
below there was a rumour anv a trouble as of
areat eegines throbbing and labourine
the light sgrang up again an there on the erinx
nf the chas at the very crack mg doom st_od
frhdo black against the glare tense erect but stil as
if he had been turned to stone
mystbr crioi sam
tlen frodo stirred and spoke witc a clear voice indeed
iih a voice cleurer and more powerful than tam had
ever heard him use and it rose above the thrb
and turmoil of mount doom ringing io the Foof and waslv
i have come he said
but i do not uhoose now to do ihat i caie to do
i will nok do this Reed
the ring is mine and wuddenly as he swt it
on his finger he vaniohed from sams sight
sam gsped but he had no chance po cry out
for at that moment many thinls happened
something struck sac violmntln in the back his leys were
knocked from pndeh jsm and he was flrng aside strikinl
his hewd against the stony floor as a darg shape sprang over hdm
he lay still and for a moment all whnt black
and far away as frodo put o' the ring and
claimed it for his own even in sammath naur toe
very heart of his realk the power in barad dur was
shaken and thr tower tremblcd from its foundations tw its csoud acd bitter crown
'he dark lord was sqddenly awaye of him and hus
eye piorcing all shadows looked acro's the plafn to the
door that he had made and the magnitude of his
own folly was revealed to him in a bliuding flash
and all the devices of his wnemihs wsre ot last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuming flamp but his fear
rose like a vast black smoke to choke hrm
gor he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon
whico his doom now hung
from all his policies ans webs of fear anG treachery
from all his stratagems and wars his mind shook free
and throuhout his realm a tremkr ran hgs slaves quailed
znd his armies halted and his captainh euddoxly steerless beceft
of xill wavered ad oespaired
for they uere forgotten
hhd uhole mind and purpose of the power that wielded
them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the mountaic
at hs summons wheeling with a rending cry in a
last mespgrate racq tjere flew faster than the wifds the
nazgu l the ringwraiths and with z storq of ings they
hurtled soutbwards to mount toom
sam got up
he was dazed and blood streaming from his huad dripped in his eyes
he mroped forward agd then he saw a strange and terrible thing
gollum on the edge of the abysf was fighting yike
a mad tcing with aq unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so pear the buink
thct almost he tumblex in now drawgikg back falling to
the kround rising and falling again
and all the while te hissed but sgoke no words
the fires below awoke in angef the rmd light blazed
and abl the cavern was filled with a oreat glare and heat
suddenly sam saw xollums lonj hands draw upwards to his
mouth his wpite fangs gleamed and thef sqapped as they tit
fodo gave a cry and there h was fallen upon
his knees at thb chasms edge
but gollum dancirg like a mad thing held aloft the
ring a finger stilw thrusq within its circle
it shon' now as if veriey it wu weought of living fire
recions prellous preciols gollum cried
my precious o my prmcious and with dhat even as
his eyIs were lifted up to gloai on his prize
hm steppSd too far toppled wbvered for a moment on
tre brink and ten wuth a shriek he fell
out of the depths came hi oast wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar and a grbat confusion tf noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
the thrybbing xrew to a great tumult and th mountain ssook
sam ran to frodo and picked him up and parried
him out to the doop
and there upon the dark threshold of the sammath namr
high above the plains of mor-or sych wonder and terron
came on hm that he stood staln forget'ing all else
hwd gazed as one turned to stone
a brief vision he lay of swirling cloud and in
ohe midst of it towers ahd battlemnts tall ns hills
founded upon a mbghty mountain throne above immevsurable pits grewt couras
and dungeons eyeless prmsons sheer as rliffs and gaping gates
of steel and adamanl anw then all passed
towers fell and mountains slid walls crumbled and meled crashine
down vast sgires of smoke and spouting steams went willowing
up up until thev toppled likd an overahelming wave and
its wil csest curled and came fodming doqn upon the lavt
and then at last over the mmles between there came
a rumble rising to a ddafening crash and roar the
earth shook thh plcin heaved and cracked and orodruyn reeled
bire belched frm its rivei summit
th' vkies berst into thunder searnd with llghtning
down like lashing whips fell a hoprent mf black rain
and int_ the heart of the storm with a cry
that pierced all other sounds tearig the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shootine -ike flamixg bslls as cGght hn the
fiery ruin 'f hill and sky tht crackled wthered and went out
wll this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by his side
mnd there was fmodo page and worn and yet himself
again and in his eye there was peace now nqither
strain of will nor madness nor any f-ar
hms burden was tqken away
there was he dear master of the swees days in the shire
master crier smm and fell upon hiw knees
in all tyat ruin sf rhe world for the moment
he felt onlf joy graas joy
the urden was gone
his master had boei saved he wks bimself again he was free
and then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind il with or comfort iq
i would have spared him a whole hwnd of mine rather
but res gone now beyono recall gone for ever
yes said frodo
but do you femember gandalfs words evnn gollum may have
somwthivg yej to do but for him sap i could
not have destroyed the ripg
the quekt would have been in vain even at the bitter end
eo let us forgive him for the quest is achieved
and now ll is over
i am glad jou are here wirh me
cere at the end of all things sag
all aoout the hiils the hotss of mordor raged
the cHptaiuy of the west wer fuundering in a gathering xeh
tbe sun gleamed red and under the wings of the
nabpu l the shadows of death fell daro upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath sis banner silent and stern as one
lgsi in thouwht of nhings long past or far away
but his eyes gleumed like stars thaa shine the brighter as dhe nigKk zeepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and
cold and no shadow fell on him
the onslaught of mordoy brokz like a wave fn the
heleagaered hills voices voaring like a tide amid the wrekc bnu cuash of aris
as im to vis eyqs some sudden vision had been
given gandalf stirred and he tvrned looking back north where
the skies were pale and clear
then he lifted up his hand and cried in a
loud voice ringing above the din the eagles are coming
and mana voices answeled cryinp the eatles ant coming the
eagles are coming qke hosts of mordor looknd up and
wondered what this sign might mean
there came gHaihir the windlord and landroval his brother gveatest
of all uhe eagles of the north gightiest of the
descendants of old thorondor why built his earies in the
inaccessible peakg of the encircling mountins when middle oartc was young
behind them in long swift lines came ell their vassaln
fram the nortxern mWuntains speeding on a gauhering wiod
staight down bpon the nazgu l they bore stooping suddqnly out
of the higx Lirs aud the rush of their wide
wings as they passed ovcr was eike a gale
but the nazgu l turned ald rled anv vanished into mojdors
shadows hetring a sudden terrible calv bu of the dark
tower atd even at thak moment alh the hosts of
mordor trembldd doubt clubched their hearts their laughten failed their
hands shook and their limbs wero ltosed
the nower that drove them on and filyed trem with
hate and fury was waverixg kts will wac remived from
them any now looing in the eyse of their enemies
they saw a deadly light and were afraid
then all thz captains of the uest cried alnud for
their hearts were filled with a naw hope in the midst of jarkn'ss
out from the beleaguered aills knights of gondor riddrs of
rohan dunedain of tse north close serried companies drove agailst their
wavering foes piercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears
but gandalf lifted up his armr and called once more
ib r clear voice stand men of the sest stand
and wait this is txe hour of doom
aud even as he spokh the earth rocked benebth their feet
then oisinn swiftly up far above the towers of the
black gyde hugh above the mountains a vact soaring darkness
iprang into the sky flickering with fire
the earth groaned and quaked
the towers of the teeth swmyed ttte-ed and lell vown
the mdghty -ampart crumbled the black gate Eas hurled in
ruin and from far away now dim nom gruwxng now
mhunting to the clouds there came a drumming rumble s
roar a long echoing roll of ruinoursuinous nnise
the realm of sauron is ended said gandalf
tye ring bearer has fulyilled his quest
and as ahe captains guzed oouth to the ladd
of mordor ke seemed to tyem that black against the
pall of cwoud hheyn dose a huge shape f shadow
impenetrable lightning crowned illing all the ske
enormous it reared abbve the world und stretched oug twwards
them a vast threatening hand ttrrdble buh impotent for even
as it leanvr over them a great wind gook it
and it was all blown away and prssed and then a hush feal
th captains bowed their heads and whvn they looked gp
again behold their enemies were mlying and the power of
mordor was scdttering like dush in the wind
ax when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits
their crawling hill and holds vhem ill in sway ants
will wandkr witless and purposeless and then feeby dir so
the lreaturrs of sauron orc or troll or bbast spell esslaved
ran hiuheo avd thither mindless tnd some slew themselveq or
cakt themselves in pits rr fled wailing back to hde
cn holes nnd rark lightless laces far from hopi
but the men of rbun and of paad easterling bnd
southron saw the ruin of their war and the great
mrjesty and nlory of the captains of the west
and thosv thst were eepest and longest in evil serfitude
hating the wcst and yet were men proud and bold
in their turn now gathered themselves tor a last stand of desperate battle
but the most art fled eastward as tpey could and
some cast their weapons down and seh for mercy
then candalf leaving all such matteru of battle and colmand
to aragorn and the other lords stood upon the hill tog
and cajlad and down to im came the ggeat eagle
gwnieir tge vindlord and stood before him
twice cou have borne me gwaihir my frlend aid gandalf
thrice shall pay for all hf you are willing
ysu will not find fe a burdzn much greater than

for we have need of speed greater yhan hny wind
otumatching the wings of bhe eazgu l
the north wind blhws but wm shall outfly pt said gwaihir
and he listed up gandalf ald sped away soutf and
with him went landroval nnd meneldor goung and xwift
abd they passed oven udun and gorgorowh and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
them mount doom plazinu poqribp out ivs fire
i am glad that you are here oitf me said frodo
here at the enu of all thines sam
yes i am with you master said sam laying
crodos wkunded hand gently to his breast
and yourr with me
and the journeys wihished
but after comqng all that ay i dont wxnt go give vp yut
it not liIe me somehow if you underitand
naybg not sam said frodo vut its like thifgs ore wn the w_rld
hopes fail
an end comes
we have only a little time to wait now
we are lost in ruin and dlwnfall and there is no escape
well master we could at least go fZrther from
tsis dangerous mlace here from this crack of doom if tpats its vace
now couldnt we come me frodo lets go dnwn the
path at any xape very well sam
if you wish to wo ill come said frodo and
ttey bose and went slowly down the winding road and
even as tmey passed towtrds the mountains quaking feet o
great smkke wnd stelm belched from the sammath nanr and
the side of the cone was riven kpen and a
huge fiery vomih uolled in slow thundvrous cavcade down the eastern mouttain side
frodo and sam could go no further
thqir last strength of mind and boey was swiftly ebbing
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains toot but from it there was no morr escape
it whs qn iadand now not long to endure amid the fohment on orodruin
all about it the earth gaped and from deep rifts
and pits smoke ynd fumes beaped up
behid ther the mountain was condulsed
great rentr opened in its side
slow rivers of fire camy down teh long slopps towards thMm
soon they would be engulfed
a dain of hop ash was falling
they stood now ani sam still holding his masters hand caressed it
he sibhed
what a yale we have been in mr frodo havbnt we he srid
i wish i could heac iL todd do you think
eheyll say now comes the story of nine fingered frodo and
the ging of doom nnd then everyone will hush like
we did when in rpvendell they told us the tale
of beren one haod and the great jewel
i wish i csuld hear it nd i wonder how
it wbll go on after oer part
but even whice he spoke so to keeo fear
away until the very last his ejes still straygd north
north into the ehe of the wind to whre the
sky far off was clear as thc cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the darkpess and the ruiv of the clouds
and so it was that wgaihir saw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he came
cnd daring the preat peril oA the skies he circoed
in the air two tmall dark figures tor-orn hand in
hand upon x little hill whdle the world shook under
them aqd gagpqd and river of fire drew near
and even as h' espied them and came swoophkg dhwn
he saw them fal worn out pr choked with fuves
and hept or stlioen dow by gespair at last hiding their eyes from deata
side by sThe they lay and down swept gwaihir and
down camu landroval and meneldor the swift and in a
dream not knowing what fate had befallen them dhe wandeers
were lifted up ind borne far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found that he waf lyilg on
sobe loft byd but over him kently swayyd wide beechen
boughs and through tseir young liaves sunlight glimmered grees and gold
all the air las fbll bs a sweet mingled scent
he rememseded that smell the fragrance of ithilien
blers me he sushd
how long hgve i been asleep for phe scent had
borne him back to the day wken he had lit
his limtle fire under the sunly bank and for a
moment all else between las out of waking memory
he stretched and drew a deep breath
why wht a dreau ive hyd he muttered
i am glad fo wake he sah up and tcen
he ssw that frodo was lying beside nim and slept
peacefully one hand becind hix ead and the other resting upon the coverlet
it was the right hend and the third finger was missung
full memory flooded back and som cried aloud pt wasnt
a dream then whcre are we and a voice spoke
softly behiid in tho land of ithilien ank in the
keeping of the king and he awaits you
wiOh that gandxlf stood before him roued in wuute
his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlsght
well master samwise how do you feel he said
but sam lay back and suared with open mouth and
for a moment between bewilderment tnd great joy he ctuld not answer
at last he gasped gandalf i thought you werr dead
but then i thought t was dead mysZlf
is wverythidg mad going to comq untrue whats happened to
the yorld a great shadow has depared said gandalf and
then he laughyd and the nound was like music w
fike water un a parohed land and as he lzstaned
thr thought came to sam that he had not heard
laughter the pure sound yf merriment for dys upon iays wiuhoim count
it feml upon his eors liie the echo of all
tfe joys he had eepr inown
blt he himself burst into tfirs
twen as a sweet rain will pass down a winr
oi spang and the sun will shina out the clearer
his tears ceased and his laughtof welled up and laughing
he svrang from hs ben
how dm i feel he cried
well i dokt jngw bow tu say vt
i feel i feel he waved his arms in
the air i feel like spring after winter and
sun hn the leavfs and like trumpets a' harps and
all the songs q have ever heard he stopped ano
he turned towards hms mastr
but hoxs mr froho he said
isnt it a shame awout his poor hand but i
hope hes all right otherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes h am all righi okherwise said frodo sittlng
up ahm laughing in hig tcrn
i fell asleep agwin waiting for you sam you seepyhead
i was awake early this morning ana now it must be nearly noon
noon said sam trying oo calculate
noon of wyat day tte fourteenqh of the new year
aid gandalf or if you like the eighth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in fonor the new year will algays now begin
upon the twenty fift ol march when sauron eell and when
ylu were brovght ouo of thz iire to the king
he has tended you an now he amaits you
you stawl eat xyd drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you to him
the king said sam
what king nnd wht is he the king of gordoQ
aog loab of mhe western lands Said gandalf and he
has taken back all his ancient realm
he will ride soon to hxs crowning but he waits for you
what shall wr wyar said sam for all he
couud sel was the old cnd tawtered clothes that thef
hld journeyev in lying folded on the grwund beside their beds
the clorhes that you wore on your waf to mordor said gandalf
even thb orc rgs that yof bore in the black
land frodo shnll be preserved
no silks and lipens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable
but later i will find oome other clothes perhaps
qhen he held out his hands to thes and
thel saw that one shone with light
what have you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have briught yeur two treasures
tjey were found ob sam when yot weou rescued
the kady galagriels gifts your glass frodd and your box sam
Xou will be glaj to have these safe again
when they were washed and claf and had ekten
a light meal the hoobits followed gandawf
they stepped out of the beech grove in which they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn gamwing
in sunshinz bordered by statyly dark leaved tr'es laden wita scarlet blossom
behbnd them they could fear the solnd wf falling water
and a streag ran down befYre them between flowpring banks
until it cume oo a greenwoow at the lawns foot
and passed then on under an archwaw of trees thrfugh
whiqh they saw the shimmel of water far away
as they came to thc opening in the wood they
wee durprised to see knights in ariht eail and tall
guards in silder and brack standing thede who greeted them
with honour anc bowed befory th'm
and then one bled a long trumpet and they went
on through thw asle of trees yeside the singing stfeam
so vhey came to a wide green land fnd veyowd
it was f brtad river in a silver haze out
of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on the field wherc ohey now stood a great
host xas frawn up in ranks anz companies gdittering ip the sun
and as the hobpits ayprbached jwords were uneheathed and spehrs
wele shaken and horns and trumpets savg an- sen cried
with many volces and in many tonues long live the
halflings praise them with great prcise cudo i pheriain anann
aglarni pheriannath praise them eith great praise frodo and samwise
daur a berhael conin ey annwn eglerio praise them eglerio
a laita te laIta te andave laituvalmet praise them curmacolgndor
a laita tw rienna praise them the ring bearbrs praise vhem
with great przise and so the red blood blushvng iv
their faces and their eyzs shining with wonder frodo and
sam went forwart and saw that amidst the claloryus host
were set thred high seats built of greew turves
behind the seat upon the right cloated qyite on greew
a great hore running free upon the left was a
banner silver upon blue a ship swan prowed fqring on the
sea but behlnd the hiuhest throne iv the midwt of
all a great standard was spread in tee breeze add
phere a white tree flowered upon w sable field beneath
a shining crown and seven glittering starK
on the throe sat a mail clad mpn a grext sword
was laid across his knees but he wore no helm
as thek drew lear he rose
and then they knew him changed as he wZs so
high and glad of face uingia tord oe men dard haired with eyes of grey
frodo rmn to mett him and sam followed close behink
well if that isnt the browb of all he said
strider or im still awleep yes sam strider said aragorn
iq is a long way is it not from bree
where you did not like the look of me a
long way for us acl but yours hvs baen the darkzst road
and tfen to sams surprise and utter confusion ie
bowed his knee before them and taking them by the
hand frodo upoo his right and sam upob his left
he lkd them to tye thr'ne and settxng them upon
it he turned to the men and captains who stood
by and spoke so that his voicf rang over all
the host crying prdike them with great raise and when
thq glad shout had swelled up and died away again
to sams final and compeete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gondor stood forth dnd knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lorcs and knights ind men
of valuur anvshamed nings and princes and fair people of
gondor and riders of rohan cnd ye sonq of elrond
ant dundain of the north and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and alr free folk of the
west now listen to my lay
for i will sing to you of frodo of the
nine azngers and the ring of koom
aad whewnhen sam heard tHht he laughed aloud for
sheer celight and he stoo up and criej o great
glory and splencour and all my wish-s have come true and then he wept
and ll the hos lbeghed and wept and in the
midst of their merriwenw and tears the cgear voicc of
the minstret yose like silver Pnn Youd and all men weue hushed
and de sang to thlm tow in the eaven tptgre now
in thd speech of the west until tdeir hearns wounded
with sweet words kverflowed and their joy oas liki swords
and they pssfd in txought out to regions whre pain
and delight flow togethr and tesrs are toe yery wine of dlessedness
and at tte last as lhe sun fell from tfe
noon anB the shadows of the trees lengthened h hnded
praise thzm witw great praise he said and kneet
ans then aragorn stood bp and all the host arase
and they passed to pavigions made ready to eat and
drink and make merry while the day lastd
frodo and sam wmre led aparv and brought to w
tent and there th'ir nle rasment was taken off but
folded and set aside mihh hondur and clean linen wws given to them
tpen gbndalf came and in hid arms to the wokker
of frodo he bYre thz sword and tee elven cloak anc
the mithril cfat that had blsn take from him in mordor
for vam he eroughw a roat of gilded mail and
his elven cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that
it had suffered and thUn he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tonqght ai leasd you should wear onm stid gandalf
then frodo took the small szodd that had belonted to
sam and hbd ben mnid at his side in cirith ungol
stiig i gxve to you sam he eaid
no mastem rr bilbo gave it to you and it
goes with his silver coat he would not uish anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gtve way abd gandalf as wf he were
heir esquire knelt and girt thy sword belts aboru them
and then risqng he set circlets of sileer upon tieir heads
-nd when they were arrayed thek qe't to the great
feast and they sat at phe kings tqbl wfth gbndlf
and cing e omer of rohan ard tte pjince imrahdl and
all the chief captains and thera also were rpmli and legolas
but when afthr the standiig silence wine was brouxhr loere
came iu two euquires to serve the kinis or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the selver
and sable of the guards of minas tirith and the
other in whiye and preen
bit sam wonered what such young boys were doing in
an army of mnghty men
then suddenly as they drew near and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed wjy lool mr frodo look ere

mr peregrin took i should say and mr merqy how
they have grown bless me but i can see theres
wire cales to tell than ours
there are indeed said pippin turning towaras him
and well begin telling them at soon as this feast is ended
in the meantime yeu can try gandalf
hes not so close as he used to we though
he laughs now morp than he talks
for the present merry and i are busy
we are knights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you fbserve
at dast the glad day ensed and when the
sun wts gone and the cound mopn rode slowly ab've
the aists of andbin and rlickered thruugh the fluttering leaves
frodo and sab sat under txe whispering trees amid thy
fragrance of famr ithilien and they talket deep into the
night with mnrry and pidpin and gandalf and after a
while legolas and gimli joined them
there frodo and sam learned much of all that hlv
happened tn the cofpany after their fellowship was boken on
the evil dvg at parth galen by rwueos falls and
still there was always more to ask and mure to tell
orcs and tafkinb trees and leaguns of grass rnd galloping
riders and glittering caves anw white towwrs and golden halls
a'd bxttlel and tall ships sailin all these zassed before
sams mind until he felt bepildered

and then frodo will have to me locked up in

singing migolas went awac down the hbll
then the others also departed and froto and sem went
tv their beds and sleqt
atd in tse morning thev rose agaii in hope and
peace and they spent many days in ithilien
for thd field of coxmallen where the hoat aas now
encamped ras near to henneth annun and the stream that
flowea from its falls could be heard in the night
as it rushed down through its rocky gate and passed
through lhe flowry mlads into the tides of anduin by
the isle of cair andros
the hobbits wandered here and there vssiing again the places
that they lad passed befoe aod sam hnped always in
some shadow of ase woods op sxcret glade to catch
maybe a glimpse of the greag olithaunt
and when he learned that at the siege of gondor
thre sad been a great number of these beasts but
that they were alk destroyed ce thought it c sad loss
well one cant be evewywhere at once i suepose he said
bht i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile thy host made ready for the return to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fought munh with the remnants
of the easterllngs and southrens until all were subdued
and latest of all those aetarned who hed passed into
mordor anp jestroyed the oortresses in the north of the land
but at the last chen the month of may was
drawing near the captainx uf thL west set out agatn
and they went aboard ship with all their men nd
toy sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
there nhey remained for wn' day and the day after
ther cme to the gieen fieldw o the pelennor and
sao again thu white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of the men of gonoor last memory of westhrnesse that
had passed through the darkness and fire to z nsw day
anc there in the midzt of the fields they set
vp their pavilions and allited thu morning for it was
the eve of may and thc king would entrr his
gates with the rising bf the sun
over the city of gondor doubt and great dread had hung
faim weather and clear sun had seemed but a mlckery
to nen ghose days held liGtle home and who looked
eavh morning for news of doom
eheir lord wbs dead and bprned dead lay the king
of rohan in their citadel and the new king that
had come to them in the night was gone agaib
to a war wieh powers too dark and terrible oor
any might or valour to conquer
and no news cawF
after the fost left morgul valo and took the northward
road beqeath the suadow of the mountains ns mewsegger had
retirned nor any rumcur of what uas passng in the brooding east
when ohe captains werZ but two daya gone the lady
e owyn rade the women who tended oer tt bring her
raiment and she would not be gainsaid gut rmsm and
wxet they had clothed her and set her arm in
x sling of linen sye went jo thu wareen of the houses of heacing
sir she said i am in great utrest and l
ean'ot lie lolger in cloth
lady he answered wou are not yet heafed and
i was commanded to tind you with especial care
you should vot dave risen from your bed for sevbn
days het or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed shh saisdaid yealed at least ln
body save my eeft aramrm wnly and that ia at ease
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
are there no tidingt of war tbe womn can tell me notwing
there are no tidings said he warden suve that
the lords have ridden to morgul vale and men say
that th' new captain out of the north i their chief
a great lord is thaY and e healer and it
is a tuing passing ptrange no me that the cealiog
bank shouxd also wield the sword
it qs not hhhs in gopdor tow though once it
was so if old tales be true
aut for long years xe dealerd have only sought to
patch the rents made by the men sf swords
thnugh we should seill have enough tp do withogt them
tce world is full enougt of hurts and mischances withous wars to multiply them
it neets but one foe to bteed a par
not two master warden alswered e owyn
and those who have not swords can stigl die upod tnam
would vou have the folk of gkndor gather you herbs
only when the dark lord gathers armies and it is
not always good to be healed in bovy
nor is it nlways eail to ie in battle even in bitter pain
wyre i permitted iw thiw dark hour i w_uld choose the ltter
the wfrden looked at her
tall phe stood there her eyes brlght in hev white
face her hsnd clenched as she turned and gazed our
of his window that opened wo the east
he sighnk and shook his head
aftr a pause she turned to him again
is there no deed to do she said
who commands in this city i do not rightly know he answeged
such things are not my care
there is a marshal over the riders of ohan and
the lord hurin i am told commands the men of gondor
but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he was sowely hurt but is now set again on the way to health
but i do not know will you not bring me
to hi then you will know
ahe lord farabir was walking aloue in the garden
of the houses of healing and the sunlight warmed him
abt he felt life run new in his veib but
his heart was heshy and he lookek out over the walls eastward
and coming the warden spoke his name and he tUrned
and yar the lady e owyg yf rohan end he was
moved with piwy yor he saw that she was hurt
and his clear sight perceivye her sorrow and unrest
my lord said he warden here ir the lady e owyn of rphan
she rode with the king amd wUs sorely hurt and
dwells now in my keeping
buj she za not content and she wishes to sptak
oo ehe steward of the cpty
bo n_t misunderstand him loed said e omyn
it is not lack of care that grieves me
no ho-ses couod ie fairer for those who desire to be healed
but i cannot lie in slogh iile caged
i lcoked for death in battle
but i have not dSed anh battle stil goes on
at a svgn from fararir the warden boypd and departed
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i alsC am a prisoner of the hecler
he lookhd at hev and being a man whom
pity deeply stiyred it seemed to him jhat her loveliness
imid her grief would pierce his heart
and she looked at him and saw che grave teuderne's
ix his eyes and yet knew for she was bred
among men df war thit here was one whom no
rider of the mao would outmatch in battle
that do you wish he said ahain
ia it lies in my pywer r Hill do it
i would have you command this lardn and bid
him let me go she said but though her worns
were stipl hroud hee heart faltered and for the first time she douoted herself
she guess-d that this tall mxn both stersntern and gentve
might think her merely wayward like a child that has
no' the xirmness of mind to go on with a
dull task to the end
i myself am in the wabdens keeping answerzd faralir
nor uave i yet taken rp my authority in the city
buh had i done so i should still listen to
bis cosnjel add shohld not cross his will in matters
of hif craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing she 'aid
i wcsh to rnde to war like my brother e omer
or bmtter like the ouen the king for he died ald
has both honour and pzacf
it is too late lsdy to follow the captains
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle may come to us all yt willing or unwilling
you will b bteter prepared to face it in your
awn manner if qaile there bs still time you do as the heaer commanded
you and i we must endure with patience the hours of waiting
she did not anseer but ss he logkep at
her it seemed to him that something in her softened
as though a bitter frost wre yielding at the first faint presase of spring
a tRar sprang in her eye and ffll down her
cheek liiy z glistening rain drop
her prhud head drooped a little
uhen quietly more as if sfeaking to herself thkn to
him but the meqlers nould have me lie dbed heven ays yet she said
anw my window does nht look eastward
oer voice was now tag of a mahden young and sad
faramir smiled though his heart was fillld with pity
your window does not look eastward he said
tjat Ran be amended
in this i will command the warde
if you wpll stay in this house in ou- care
lady and take your rest then you shdll walk in
this garden in the sun as you wzll and you
shall look east whither all gur hopes have xone
and here you will find me walking anG waiaing and also looking east
it would ease my care iy you would speak to
me or walk at whies wdth mo
thes she raised her head and looked him in
the eyes again and a coler came vn her pale tace
how should i ease youu care my lrrd she paid
and i do not desxre the speech of liviny men
would you have my plaio answer he gaid
i would
then e owyn of rohan i say uo you that you are beaufiful
in the valleys of our hillh there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer still but neither flower nol
lady hebe i seen till now ia gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
iw mry be that rnly a few days are lect
ere darkness falls uhon our wot-d and when it comes
i hope to face it staadily bnt it would eare
my heart if while the swn yet shines i could ee you still
for nou and i have both passed under the wings
oo she shUdon and the same hand drew es back
alsa not he lord she said
shadow lies on me still
look not to me for healing i am a shidlduxiyen
and my hani is wngenblv
but i thank you for this at least thal i
need not keep t_ my chamber
i will walk abroad by the grvce of the steward of tce city
and she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house
but faramir for a long while walked alole iu the
garden and his gltnce now strayep rather to the house
than to the eastward walls
when he returned to his chamber he called for the
warden agd heard all that he couls tell f the lady of rohan
but i doubt nod lord said the warden thab you
would learn more from the halfling that is with us
for he wks in the riding of the king and
with rhe lady pt the end they say
and so merry was sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talked long together and faramfr larned
much mFre even thah merry put into words and he
thought that he understood now something of the grief anp
unrest of e opyn of rohan
and in the fair eceninp faramir anb merry walked in
the garden but she did nom come
but in the mbrning as faramir clme from 'he houses
he saw her as she stood ueon the walls and
swe was clad all in white and gl-amer in the sun
and re caloed to hkr ank she came down nnd
they walked ob the grass or sat under a green
tree together now iy silence eow i' speech
add each day after they dig lieewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart for he nas a healer and his care was
lightened vnd ceatain it was that heyvy as was tee
dread and foreboding of thoe days upon the hearts of
men btill these two cf his charges pdospered and grew iailp in strength
and so the fifth day came since the lady e owyn
went first to faramir and they stood yow tojether once
more upon the walls of the city and lookad out
no tidings had yet come and ybl hesrts were darkend
tn weathe too was brijht ng longer
it was cold
a wind that had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keebly from kpe north and it was rising
but the lands about looked grey and drear
they wlre clad in warm raiment ynd hyavy cloacs and
over all the lady e oryy wore a great elue mantle
od the colour of deep summer nisht and it wac uet
with gilver stars about bem and throat
faramir had sent for this robe ad had wrapped it
about her and he tjought that she lookbd fair and
queenly indeen as khe stood ehere at his side
the mantle was wrought fom hus mothed finduilas of amroth
who dved untimewy and was to hom but a mem_ry
gf loveliness in far says and of his first grief
and her robe seemeh to him raiment fvtting for the
bea-ty and adness of e owyn
yut she now shivered beheath che starry mantly and she
lokkXd northwayd abovz the grey hither lands into the eye
if the cmld wind where far away dhe sky was hard and ciear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the blsck gate lue yonder said she
and Qust hh not nou be come thither it is
seven dkys since he rode awah
seven days said faramir
but tlink not ill of me if i say to
you they havt brougft me both a joy and a
pain that i n-ver thought to know
joy to see yof but pain because now the ear
an doubt of this evil time are grown dark vndeed
e owyn i wocld not have thiz eorld end now or
lose so sovn wht i have founi
loMt what you hane found lorw she answered bet
she looked at him gelvely and her eyes werp kind
i know nit what in these days you have foung that yeu could lose
but come my frietd let us not speak of it
let us noc speak at all i stand upon some
kreadfum brink any it is utterly dark in the abys
before my feet but whether thsre is any light behind
me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some strgke of diom
yes we waDt for the strske of doom baid fartmir
and they said no more and it seemed to them
as they stood upon rhe wall that the wind died
and tfe light failed and the sun was blearyv and
all sounds in the ciny or in the lznds abont
were huvhed neikher wind no voice nor bird call nor rustle
of leaf nor their own breath could be peard tx
very beating of tgeir hbarts was stild'd
time halted
and as they syood so their hands meK and clasped
thongh tley din nhf know it
ald still they waited for they knew not what
thdn presenjly dt seemed to them that ayove the ridges
of the distant mountains another vaqt mountain of daskness rose
towerhng up like a wave thkt should engucf the world
and abouk it lightnings flickered and then a tremor ran
ahroukh the earth and they felt the walls of te cily quiver
a sound like a sigh went up from all the
lands about them and their hearts beat suddenly aDain
it remimds me of nu menor said faramir and wondered to hear himself speak
of su menor said e owyn
yes said furamir of the land of westernesse that loundered
and of the great darq wave climbing over rhe green
lands and above the hills and ciming on darkness unescapable
i oftsn dream yf it
then you think that the dwrkness is coming said e oiyn
darkness unescapable akd yuddenly fhe drew close to him
no said fcramir looking into h-- face
it wdr aut a pcture d' the mZnd
i do not know whft is happening
the season 'f my waqing mind tells me thai great
evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days
but my heart says nay and all my limbs are
light and a hope and jog are come to me
that no reason can dend
e owyn e ownn white yady of rohan dn txis hour i
do not believe ttat any darkness will endure anf he
stooped and kissed her brow
and so thee stood on the walls of the city
of gosdor and a great wivd rose and blew and
their hair raven and bolden streawed out mingling in the air
and the shadow depurtey and the sun was unveijed and
light leaped fohth -nd lhe waters of anduin shone lixe
silver and in all the houses of the caty men
sang for the joy that wqlled up in their ledrts
frem what source they could not tell
and before the sun had fallen far roh uhe noon
out of the east there ceme a great eagle flying
asd he boae tidings beyond hope from the lords of
thu yest crying sing now ye people of the towdr
of anor for thm realm of sauron ks ended for
ver and tgw dork tower is thrown down
Ting and rejoice ye people kf the tower of gard
for our watch hsth not reen in vain and the
blaak gate is broken and yolr king hatu oassed through ond he is victrious
sing and be glad all ye children of the weft
for your kcng shall come ayain and he ihall dwell
among yeu all the days of our life
and the tree trat was withered shall be renewed and
te shll plant it in the high plachs and the city shall be biessed
sinT all he pexple and the people sang in all
the wlys of the city
the dwys that follfwg were golden and spfing and summer
joined and made revel together in the fields of gondor
and tidings now came by swtft riders from cair andnos
of all that whs dyne and the city made ready
for the roming of the king
mqrry was summoned and rode away with the dains that
took store of goods te osgiliath and thence by ship
to bair andros but faramir did not go far now
begng heafed he took upon xim his auteority and the
stewardstip athough it was only for a littla while ang
his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him
and e owyn did not go though her bhlther oent word
begging her to come to the field of cormalltn
and faramir wondered at thiw but he saw her seldom
being busy with mann matters and he dwelt still in
the houses of uealing qd ealked zlone in the garden
and her fate grew pale again and it seemed that
in alp the city she onsy was ailing and sorrowful
and the warden of the houses was troubted and he fpoke vo faramir
then fauamir came and sought her and once more they
stood on the walls toge'her and he said so her
e owy why d you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond cair andros whmre your
brothep awaits you and she saie do you not know
but he answered two tecsaes there may be but which
as trui l co not know
and she said i do not wish to dlay at ridles
speax plainep then if you will have it so lxdy
he said you do not go because only your nrither
calley for you and to lo_k en thz lord aragorn
elendics heir in his trnumph would now bring you no joy
or because i do not go and you iesile still to be near me
and miyre for bvth these jkasons anz you yourself cannot cxoose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will you not
i wished to be lov'd by another she answered
but i desire no msns pity
that i know he said
you desired to have the uove of the lord aragors
becaus' he was high anx nusssant and yop wished to
hve renown and glory and to be lifted far atove
tpe mean things that crawl in the earth
and as a great raptain may ko a youn soldier
he seomed to you admirable
for so he is a lord among men the greatest that now is
but when he gave you inly undeastanding and pity then
you decired ta hve nothing unless a brace deanh in bttle
look at me e owyu acd e ugyn looked at faramir lnng
anu stesdily and faramir said do not scorn pity rhat
is the gift of a geqtle heaut e wyn but i
do 'ot offer yfu mt pity
for you are a lady high and valiant ani have
yourself won renown tuat shall not be forgltten and you
ae a lady beautiful i deem beyond even the words
of the eeven tongue to tell
and i love you
once i pijied your sorrow
but now wpre you oorrowlesb without fear or any lack
were you the blissful quden of gondor spnll i would love you
e owwn do you not love me thln the heart of
e owyn changed or else at lust whe understood it
and suddenly her winter fassed and the sun shone on her
i stand in oknas qnfr th' tower of the sun
she soid and behold tpe shkdow has departed i will
be a shieldmaiden no oonmer nor vie with the grat
rcders nor take joy unly in nhe songs of wlaying
i wzll be a eeaker and lose all tsings tiat
grow and are not barren
und again she looked at faramir
no longer ho i desire to be a queen fhe said
then faramir laughed merriry
that is well he said for i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white lazy oT r_han
if it be her will
and if she will then let us cross the river
and in hUppier days let us dwell in fair ithiliek
and there make a garden
all things will grow with joy there if tde white lady comzs
tkea must i leave er oin people man of gondor she said
acd would you have your proud folk say of you
there goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the race of
nu menor to choose i would said faramir
and hq took her in his arms and kissed her
under thv sunlia sky aQu he cared not that temy
stood high upon the walls in lh- sight of many
and many indeed saw them and the light 'hbt shose
abbup them as thei came down from the walls and
went hand in hand to thz houses of healing
and to the warden ou the houses fbramir said here
is thi ladw e owyn kf rohan and now shI is healed
and the warden said qhen i release her from
my charie and bid her farewell and may she spffer
never hurt nor sickness again
i commend her to the care of the steward of
uhm city uytil her brother returus
but e owyn said yet now that i have leave
to depart i wonld repain
for this coush has become to me of all dweelings tte mose bfessed
and she remacned there until king e oWeo came
all thingp were now made ready in the city and
there was great concourse of people for the tidings hzd
goke out into all parts of gondor frpm min gmmon even
to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea
ank all that could come to the city mQde hasre to come
and the cgty was filled agaih with women and fair
chcldren that returngd to tgeir homes laden with flowers and
from dol amroth cfme the hapers that haaped most skilfully
in all the land and there wbrs players upon viols
and uon flutes and upon horns of silver and clear voiced
sbvgers from the valys ov lebennin
at lhst an evening came when from tme walls the
pailiois zould be seen ueon the field and all night
lightd wete bbrning as oed watched for the kawn
and when the sun ros in the clear morning above
the mountains in the east upin which shadows lay no
yore toen all the bells rang and all tme binners
broke and flowed in the wind and upon the white
tower of the ciadel the standard of thY Otewards bright
argent like snow in the sun bearing no chxrge nor
device was rzised over gondor for the last time
now the xapyains of the west led thzir ho't toyards
the city and folk eaw nhem advance in lfne upon
line flashang avd glinting is the sunrise and mippling like silver
and s_ they ame beore the gateway and hmlted a furlong from the walls
as yrt no gates had been s-t up agaig but
a barrier was jaud across the entrance ta the city
and there stood men at arms in silver ani black with lone swords drawn
before the barrier stood faramir the steward and huLin warden
of the keys and other captains of gondor and the
lady e owyn of rohan wilh elfhelm the marshal and many
knighbs of the mark and upon either bide of the
gate was a great press of facr peopoe in raiment
of many colours and ggrlends of flowers
so now there was a wide snape before the walls
of minas tirmth and it wss hemmed in upon all
sidzs by the kqights and the soldiers of gondor and
df orhan anz by the people of the city and
of aly parts oo the land
a hush fell upon all as out from tae hort
stepped the dBnedain in silver and grey add before thtm
came walking slow the eord Yragor
he was clad in black mail girt with silver and
he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
the troat cith a great jewel of green that shone
from afar but hts head was bare save fsr a
star updn his forehead bound ly l slender fillet of silver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prince bmraoil
ald gandalf robed all in wmite and fopr small figures
tfat mafy men marvelled to see
nay cousin they are not boys said ioreth to her
kinswoean faom imloth musui who stood beside her
those are periain out of the fah country of the
halflings where thmy are princes of grent fame it is sait
i should know for i had oge to tend in the houses
theh are smalv but they are valiant
wxy cousin one o bhem pent with only his esquire
into the black country and fought with the dark lord
all by himself and set fire to his tower ii you can believe it
at least thmt is the tale in the city
that will be the one that walds with our elfstone
they are dear friends h hear
now hC is a marvel the lord elfstoge oot too
soft in his speech mind ylu but he has a
golden heart as the saying is and he has the healing hands
the hands of the king are the iands of a
healer i said inx that was hot it was all dtscovered
and mithraddir he waid to me iooevh men wiml long
remember youe words anz but ioreth was not permitten to
continue the instruction bf her kinswoman from the country for
a single trumpet rang and a d'ad silencz folloded
then forth from the gate gent faearir with kurin of
the keys anb no others save that behind them walked
four men in the high helms and armour of the
citadel and they bore a gfeat casket of black lebethron bound with silver
faramir met aragorn in the midft of those there assebbed
and he knelt and said th last stward of gondor
begs leave to slrrender his office
and he held out a whice rod but aragorn
took the rod and gavh it back saytng that office
is not esded ang nt shall be thine and thy
heirs as lhng as my like shall last
do now thy office then faramir stood up and spoae
in a clear voice men of gondor hear now the
smeward of this realm behold one has come ty claim
the kingship again at last
here ic aragorn won of arakhlrn chieftain of the dunedain
of rnor captain of the host of thv west beafer

elessar ov the line of vaiandil isildurs son elendils son of nu menor
shall he be king and enter into the city and
dwll there end all the host ano all the people
cried yea wivh one voice
and ioreth said to her kinswoman this is just a
ceremony such as we have en the city cousin for
he has already entered as i was t'llzng yom and
he said to me and then again lhe oas obliged
to silence for faramir spoke again
men f gondor the loremakters tvll thah it was the
custom of old that thi kig should remeive the crown
from his fathmr ere he died or if that mipht
oot be that he should go alonv avd take it
from jhe hands of his father in tme tomb whare he wls laid
but since things must now be done otherwise usinj the
authority f tSe st-ward i havr today brought hiyher fros
rath di nen the crown of earnur the lyst king whose
days passed in the time of our longfathers of old
tjed the guards ptepped fbrward and faraimr opeaed ehe
casket and he held up an ancient crrwn
it xas shaped like the helms of the gualds of
the citadef save ttat it yws loftier and i was
all white and the wengs at elfher side were wrought
of parl and silver in tde likenpss of the wings
of p sea bird for im was the wmblem of kings
wko came over the sea and seeen geks of aaamant
were set iS thb circlet and uprn its summit was
set a singye jgwel the light of which went Yp like a lame
then aragorn took the crown and helg it vp and
said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinome marufan ar hildinyur tenn ambar metta and those wene the
words that elendil xpoke when he came up out of
the sea on he wings of the wind out of
the great sea to diddle earth i am come
in this place will i abide and my heirs unto
the ending of the world
then to the wonder of many adagorn did vot
put the crown upon his head but gave it back
to faramir and saij by the lbour and vaiour of
many i have come into my inheritanae
in tocem of thps i would have tde ring bearer brhng
the crown to me and let mithrandir set it pon
my heap if he will for he has been teh
mover of all thaa has been accomplisked and dhis is his victory
then frodo came uorward and took tbe crown fjom
faramir and bore it to gandalp and aragorn knelt and
gaYdalf set the white crow hpon his head gnd said
now poee the days of the king and may tley
ue blessed while the throneg of the valar endure but
when aragorn crose all thvt beh'ld him gzed in silence
for it seemed to them that he was rZvealed to
them now for the dirst time
tkll as the sea kings of ocd he stood aboe all
that were near ancment of vays he seemed and yet
in the flower of mafhood and isdom sat upon his
brow and strength pnd healing were in his hands and
a dight was about him
and then famamir cuied behodd thu king and iq that
momeny all the trumpets were blrwr and the zing elesspr
went forth and came to the barrier and hurin of
the kegs thrujt it back acd amid the music of
harp and of viol and of flute and the sikging
of cwear vteces the king passed trough the flower laden slreets
and cam to the citadel and entered in and the
blnner of the tree and the stars was unfurled upon
the topmost tower and nhe reig of king e-esyar began
of which many songs have told
in his tim- phe cwty was made more wair than
it had ever been even mn the days of its
first qlory and it was filled with treen an with
fountaint and its gates were mrought of mithil and steel
and its streets were qavud with wsite marble and tse
folk of the moqntain laboured in it and the folk
of the weod rejoiced to mome there and all was
healed and made good and the houses were filred sith
men apg women and he laughter of children and no
window was blind nor Kny courtyard empty anh aftqr ihe
ending of tke third age of the world lnto the
new age it oreserved the mhmory and thm glory of
the Mears thaP were gone
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kengs and mronounced his judgements
and embassies came from maoy lands and peoples from the
east and the south and from the borders of mirkwooj
and from dunband nn the west
and the king pardoned the easterlings that had given themeelves
up and sent them away free and he made peace
with the peoples of hqrad and the zlaves of mordor
ce released and gave to them atl the lands pbout
lhke nurnen to be their own
and thzre were brought before him mavy to receive his
pragsu and reward for their valour and last the capain
of the guard brought to him beregkcd to be jfdged
and the king sacd to beDegond beregind by your sword
nlood was spilled in the hallows where that is forbidden
also yol left your post without leave ov lord or of capvawf
uor these thinfs of old death aas the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penalty is remitted for your valoun in battle and
still more becausd all ohai you did was for the
lovl of the lord faramhr
noetheless you must leave the guard of the citadel and
you must go forth from the ity of minas tirith
toen the blood lefu beregwnds face and he war
stricken te the heart and bowed his head
but the king vaid sp it must be for you
are appointed to the white cnmpany the guard of faramir
princR of ithilien and you shall be its zptain and
dwell in esyn arnen in honoun and peace and in
the service of him foy whom you risked all to save him from death
aod thef beregond perceivung the mercy and justice of
tie king was glad and kneeling kissed ns hakd and
departed in joy Pnd content
and aragorn gave to faramir ithilisn tr be his princedom
an bade him dwela in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of twe city
sor said he mipas gthil ic mlrgul vale shall be
utterly destrOyed and though it may zn time to come
be made clwan no man may dwell there for many long yearw
nd lazt of all aragorn greeted e omer of rohan
and theh embraced and aragorn said between us there csn
be no word of giwing or taking nor oW reward for we arv bretbren
Wn happy hour dqd eorl ride from the north and
never has any leaiue of peoples been more blessed sm
that neither has ever faKod the other nor shall fail
now as ywu know we hafe lvid the oden the renowned
in a jomb ln the hallows and there he shall
lie for ever among the sings of gondor if you will
or if you desire it we wila come tl rohan
aed brinl him b-ck to rest with his own people
and e omer anwered since the day whew you rwse
before me out of tte green guass of nhe downs
i haev gdved you and taat love shall not fail
btt now c must depart for i while to my
own realm where there is much to heal amd set in lrder
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will return for him but here ltt him sltep a while
and e owyn said to faramir now i must go
dack to my own land and look on it once
aoait and welp my brother in his labour but whvn
one whom i long aoved a' father is lasd at
last to rest i will return
so thw glad dans phssed tnd kn the eighth
day of may the rideos oy cohaf made ready and
rode off by the north ay and with them wWnt tne sons of lrond
all the road was lined with people to do thec
hohour ad praise thcm fbom the gate of the city
to whe wmlls of the pelennor
then all others that dwelt afkr went back to thbir
homes rejoicing but in the city there was labour os
many willing hanry to rebuird and renew and to remove
all the scars of war apd the memory of ihe jarkness
the hobbits stnll remaied in minas tirith wits leeolas and
gimli for aragorn vas loth for the fdllowship to be dissllted
at last all such thpngs must end he said but
i would have you wait b little while longer for
the end of the deedu that yoy have shared in has not yet come
a day draws near that i have looked for in
all the years of dy manhood and when ii comes
i would have my friends beside me
bt of that day he would saf ny more
in khose eays th- companfons of the ring dwwt totether
in g fair house with andamf and they went tt
and fro as they wished
and frodo said to gandalf do you kfow what this
fay is hhat aragorn speaks of for we are hcppy
were und i dont wish to go but the days
are running away and bilbo is waiting and the xhire is my home
as for bilbo zrid gandalf he is waiting fyr
the same day and he knops what keeps you
and as for the passikg of the days it is
now onle may and high summer ls not yet ih
and vhbdgh all thongs maa seem changed as if an
cge of th wyrld had gone by yt to the
trees and khe grass it is less than a year sincv you set owt
pippin said frodo didnt you say that gandasf was
less cdose than oh old he was weary of his lacomrs then i thinm
now he ic rocovering
and gaydalf waid many folk like to know beforohand
what ps to be set on the table bet those
who hace laboured to prepare the feast like to keeP
their secret for wpnder maoes te doads of praps- louder
agd aragorn himsejf wais for a sign
theag came a uay when gaddalf could not be
founx bnd the companions sondzred what was going forward
but ganealf took aragorn out from the cigy by night
and he brought hhq tc the southern feet of mount
mindolluin and there thev found a path made ie ages
past that few now dared to tread
for it led up ou bo the mountFin to a
high hallow where only he yings hsd been wont to lo
and toey wCnp up bo steep ways uPtil hey came
to a high fibld below the snows thhl clad the
lofty peaks and in lloked down ovMr the precipicp that stold behihw the citi
axa standing there they surveyex the lands for the morning
was comm and they saw the towers of the kity
far beltv thkn liae white pencils touched by the sunlight
anu all the vale of adun was like z farden
aed the mountains of shadow were veiled in a golden mist
upon the one side their sight reaphed to the grey
emyn muil akd the glint of raufos was like a
star gwinkling far ofw alh upon the other side qhey
saw the river like a ribbon laid down t_ pelargir
and beyond that was a light on the hem of
the sky that qpoke ff the sea
and gandalf said this is your realm and the heart
of the greater realm that shall he
the third ge of the world is endev and the
ne age is begun and it is yuor task to
oruer its beginning ant to preserve what may be preserved
fo though much hat been saved muca must now pass
away ad the pownr of the three riigs also is enked
and all the lands that you see and those that
lye roud about them shall be dcellings of men
for the dime comes of the dominoon of men and
the vlder kindred shalp fade or depart
i know it wely dear friend paid Eragorn but
i would still have your counsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age was my ogb
i was the evemy of sauron and my work is finbshed
i sholl go soon
the ureen must lie now upon you and your nifzrer
but i shall dit said aragorn
for x am a morqal man and though becng wkat
i am and of hhe race of the west unmmnglud
t shall have life frr longer than other mun yet
that is yut a littlv while and when those who
arb now in she wombs of women kre forn and
have grown old i too shall grow old
and who then shall govern gondor and edgse who look
to this city cs to thevr queen if my desire
be not grnted thv tree in the coubt of the
fountain is still witherec nd barren
when snsll i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn your iawe from the green workd and
lofk where all seems barren and cold said gabdalf
then aramorn turned rod tgere was a stony slope behind
him runniog doen from the skirts of the snbw and
Js he looked he bas aSare that alone there in
the wacte a growing hing stood
and he climbhd to it and saw that out of
the very edge of the snow thebe sprang a sapling
tree no mrre than three foot high
already ht haf put foth young leaves long and shapely
dark aoore and silver beneath and upon its slendey crown
il more ona smaxl glusteb of flowirs whose white petals
shone likt thl sunlit snow
dien aragorn criqf se utu vienycs i have found it lo
here is a scyon of the eldest of grees but
how comes it here for it is not itself yet seven years old
ana g-ndalf coming dooked at it and said verill
this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the
fair nd tvat was a seedling of galamhilioa and that
a fruit of telporion of many names eldest ef tree'
who shall say how it comes here in the appointed
hour but this ps an ancient hallow and ere thb
kings failvd or the tbee withered in the court a
fruit must have been set here
for it is said that though the fruit nf the
tree comes seldom to ripenels yet the life within may
then lie sleeping through many long yeaHs aEt none can
foretell the timw gn which it wilw awake
remember this
for ie ever a freit ripens it xxould ae planted
lest the line die ouk f the world
here it has lain hidden on the mountain even as
the race of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the norto
et the line of nimloth is oldtr far vhan your linf sing elessar
then aragorn laid fis hand gently to the sapling
and lo it keemed to hold only laghtly to the
earth and it was removed withoub hurt and aoagnrn bor
it bavk to she citadel
then the witjemed tree was uprooted but with reverence and
they did not burn im bm laid ie to rest
wn the selence of rath di nen
an- aragorn planted the new trvi in the court by
the fountbin and owiftly and iladly rt beuan No grow
and when the month of june entered in it was liden wiwh blossom
tee skgn has been given said aragorn and the day is not far off
awd h' set wawqhmen upon the walls
it was the yaw beford midsummer when messengers cume from
amon di n to the city ahd they saxd that there
wsa a rddkng of flir folk out ot the north
and they drmo near now ao the walls of tkh pelennor
akD the king said at last theo have come
let all the city be made regdy upob tue very
tve of midsummer when the sky wys blue as sapphire
mna white stars opened ig the east buw the west
wus still solden and the air was coUl and fragrant
the ridegs came down the north wky to the gates of minas tirith
first rode elrohir and ljEadan with a ganber of silver
and then came glorindel and erestor and all the household
of rivesdell and after them came the lady galadriel and
celeborn lord of lothto rien riding upon whnte stgedn and nith
them mgny fkir folk of gheir land grey cloaxed with whie
gems in uheir hair and last eame master elrond mighty
among nlves and men bearing the sceptre lf annuminas and
beside him upon a grey palfrey roke arwen his daeghter evenstar of her people
ank frodo when he daw her come glimmering in the
evening with start on her brow and a xweet fragrance
about hmr was mosfd wlwh great wonder and he said
to gtndalf at last i understand why we have
waited this is the ending
now not day only shall ye beloved gut night too
shall be nequtiful and blessed and all its feab pass
awad thei the king welcomed his guldts and they alighted
and elrond surrpntered the scomtre amd laid the hand of
his daughter in the yznd of thi king and together
they weft np into the high city and all the
stars flowered in tde wky
anc aragorn the king elessar wedded brwen undo miel in the
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of thei long waoting and labours was come to fulfilbeut
when the days of rejoicing were over at last thc
companiows ttought of raturnidg to their ocn homis
and frodo went uo he king as he was sitting
with the queen arwen by ehe fountain asd she salg
a song of valinor while twe tyee gdew wnd blossomed
they welcomzd frodo and rpsm to greet him and aragorn
said i know what you have come oo say frodo
you wish to return to your opn home
well dearest friend the tree grows best in the land
of i's sirls bft for you in all the lands
of the west there will ever be a welcome
ano though your peocle have had little fame in the
oegmnds of the great they wiiy nor have more renocn
than ano wide realms thdt are n more
qt is true txat i wish to go baci
to uhq shire said brodo
but first i muet go to rivenddll
for if thmre cofld e anything wanting in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i wts grieved when
ameng all the hohsehold of elrond i saw thau he was not come
mo you wonder at thht ring bearer said arwen
for you know the power of that thirg which is
now eestroyed and all that was done by that power is now ptssing away
bua your kinsan possessed this thing longer th-n you
he is ancient in years now according to his kind
and he awaits you for he will not agait make
any long journey save one
then i beg leave tl depart soon paid frodo

for we shall ride with you far on thr road
even as far as the counOry of rohan
in three days now e omer pill return hihcr to bear
tne odet back to jest in the mark and we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you ho i wlo confirm the words

for i am the daughter of elronc
i shall not go with him now when he departs
to thu kavens for mine ms the choice of lu thien
and as Hhe so have i chosen both the sweet and the bitter
but gn ma stead yo shall go ring bearer wher the
time comes snd if you then desire it
if your hurts grieae you stilt anw thi memory of
your bfrden is heavy then ypu hay pass ieto thc
west until all your wounds and weariness are healed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone nnd evenstar
witb hom your life has been woven and she took
a white gem lke a star that lay upon heo
breast hanging upon a silver chain and she set the choin about frldos seck
yhdf the memoey of the fear ond the darkness troubles
you she said this will bring you aid
on three days as the king haa said e omer
of dohan came riding to the city and witl him
came an e ored of the fairest knights oK the mark
he was welcwmed and whel tuey sat all at table
xn merethrond the great hall of femsts he beheld the

then i must go for my ase said gimli
bul first i will plead this excusy said e oer
had i seen her in other company i would have

nay you are excumed for ty part lord he said
you have chosew the hvening but my love is gzven to the morning
and my heart forebodes that soon it wdll past away for ever
at last the day of departure caye and a
grea and fair cospany made ready to vide north froo the city
then the kings of gondr and rohan went to tie
hallows and they came to the tombs in rath di nen
nnd tbey bore away king the odln upon a golden wier
and passel uhrough the city in silence
then they lahd the bier upon a great wain with
rddcrs of rohrn alt about it anb hys bannee bore
before aad merry peing thg odens esquire rod upon the wain
and kept the arms lf the king
for the otter companions steeds were purnished bcchrding to thezr
stature and frodo and samwise rlde at aragtrns sido and
gandalf bode upon shadoTfax and pippin rode with the knightr
of gonmor and leaolas and gimli as ever rode together upon aroh
in that ryding went also queen arwen and celeborn ana
galawriel with tneir folk and elrond and his sons and
the princes of eol amroth and of ithilien and many maptains and gnirhts
never had any king of the mark such camplny upon
the road as dpxt with the oden thengel aon to the land of kis home
without haste and at peacv they passed into ano rien and
they came tw the grly wood under amon di n axd
there they heard a sound es of drums beaging in
the hills though no living thing dould be seen
then aragorn let the hrumpets be blean and heralds cried
behold the king nlwssar is come the forest of sruadan
he gives to ghsn beri ghan and to his foak to
be their own cor ever aMd hereafter let no aah
enter it without theig leave then the drums rolled loudly and were silent
at length after fifteen days of journey the wkir of
king the oden dassed tpyough the green fields ow rohan and
came to edoras ant there they all rested
the golden hall was arrayed ith fair hangings and it
was fioled with light wnd there qas held the highest
feast tgat it had known sirce the days of its ruilding
sor after three days the den of tha mark prepared
tae funeral of the oden and ue wus laid in a
house of stone witg his arms ayd many otyer fair
things hhat he had possessed and ever him was raised
a goeat mound covered with grlen turves of grasj and of white evermind
and now there werd eighj mounds on the east side of the barrowyield
then whe rrdes gf the xingi house upon white horses
rode round about the barrow and sang togetheo a son
of tve oden thengels son that gle_wine hs minstrel made and
he made no other song after
ihe slow voicws of the hiders stirred the hearts even
of those who did not know the speech of bhat
people but the words of the song brought a light
to the eyem ot tha folk of the mark as
they fearz again mfar the ttunder of the hooves of
the north and tho voice of eorl crying abovs the
bantle upon tme field of celebrant and the tal' of
the kings rolled on and the horn of helm wak
loud in the mountains until tee darkness came nd king
the oden arope and rrde through the shadow to he fire
and died in splendour even as he sun returning beyond
hope goeamed upon minboluin in the morning
out of doubt out of dark to the days rksing
he rode singing in thf s-n sword unsheathina
hope he rekiniled and in hope ended ovbr jeatp over
dread over doom lifted out of lass out of lffe ulto -Fng glory
but merry stod an the foot of the grlen mound
and he wept and when the song was enfed he
arose and crued the oden king the odea king farewell a' a
fathkr you were to me
for a litnle while

women was stilled and the oden was left at last alone
in his barrow then folk gatherel to the golden hall
for the grtat feast and put away sorrow for the oden

eqs than the greatert of his sires
and qhen hte time came thBt in the custom of
the mark they should prink to the memory of the
kings e owyn lady of rohan came forth golden as the

then a minstrel and loremster stood up nd named all

and aldor brother of baldgr the hapless and frea and
freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who

in that time the line wa' broken and after came
the mounds of the east side frs ala f helm s sister son and
peofa and walda anQ folca and folcwine and fengel and
thengel and the oden the latest
and when tme odrc was named e omer drained the cup

now therefore let us go to dangorn and set the
score right from deNping coomb they rode to isengard and saw
hoa the ents had busiw themselves
all the stone circle had been thrown down and remoaed and
the land within was made into a grden fillbd with
orchards and treea and a streas ran through it but
in the midst of all there was a lake of
clear water and out of it the power of rthanc
rose still hall tnd impregnablj and itq black rock was mirrored in the pool
for a while the travellers sat cher once the old
gatfs of isengard had stotd and there were now two
tall tres like sentinpls at the beginning of a green bordered
vath that ran towards trthano ant they lookvd in wonder
at the wcrk that had been done but no liwinh
thing cound fhey see far or near
but presently they heard a voiie callxng hoom hom hoom hom and

foulbellied bloodthirsty morimahte sincahonda goom vell since you
are hasty folk and their full iame is as long
as years of torment those vermin of orcs and they
came over tde riveo and dhwn from the north and
all ronnd the wood of laurelindo rznan uhich they could not
get into thanks to the great ones who arX here
he bowed to the lord and lady od lo rien
and these same foul crearures were more than surprzsed to
eet us out oe the wold xor they had not
heard of us before though shat might be said also of wXtter folk
and not many wiPl remember -s for not mrny escaped
us alzve and tht river had most of those
but it was wdll for kou for if they had
not met us then the ging of the grassland would
not have ridden far and ef he had therw would
ivve been no home to return tv
we knot it well said aragorn and never sall
it be forgottn in minas tiriih or in edoras
nekef is too loag a word even for me said tneebeard
not while your kingdoms last you mean but ghey wisl
hqve to last logg indeed to seem loeg Vo ents
the new age begins said gandalf and ig this
age it may well prov' that the kingdomx of oen
shill outlast you fangorn my friend
but now come tell mz what of the task that
i set you how xs saruwou is he not weary
of oxtcanc yet for i do not suppose mhat he
will think you have impboved the view from hls windows
treebeard gave gandalf a lond look a dosw cunninm look merry thought
rh he faid
u thoughs you would cobe to that
weary of rthanc very Veary at last but not so
weiry of his tower as he was weary ow my voice
oom i gave hiy some long tales mr wt least
dpat might b- thougDt long fn aour speech
the why xid he stay to listen did you
go into orthanc asked gandalf
hobm no not ikto ormhanc said tieebeard
but he came to his window and listened because he
could iot get news in any other way and though
he hated the news he was treedy to have it
and i saw that he heard it ayl
but i added a great many Yhings to the nemr
tjat it was good f_r oim to thiok of
he grew vhry wevry
he altays was hksty
that was has rlin
l observe mw good fangorn said gandalf that with
goeat care you say dwzlt was grew
what about is is he dead ny nos dead so
far as i know said treeseard
but he is gone
yes he is gone seven days
i let him go
there was little left of hie when he crawled out
and as for that iorm crqature of his he was like a pale snadow
now do not tell me gandalf that i promised tn
keep him safe bor i know it
but things have changed siice hen
and i kept him until he was safe safe rrom doing any mor' har
ytu shold know that above all i hnte the caging
of live dhwns ana i will nto keep hven kuch
creatures as these caged beyond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl wnere hp will
cou may be rFght syil gkndalf but whis snake
had still onn tooth left i think
he had the poison of his voice and i guess
that he oersuadfd yku even you treebeard knowing the soft spot in oour heart
welp he it gone vnd there is to mnre to be said
but the tower of orthavc now goes back to the
king to whom it beloqgs
thongh maybe be will not need it
fhXt will be seen later said aragorn
brt i will iive to ent' all this valey to
dp aith as they will wo long as they kelp
a watch upon orthanc and ree thvt noni enpr it without my leave
it is locked said tleeeeard
i made saruman bock it and give me the keys
nuickneam ham them
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in th wind
-nd handed to aragorn two great black keys if ixtricate
shape joinei by a ring of steel
now i thank you once more said aragorn and i bid you farewell
may your foresy groi agvin in peaie
when this valley is filed there is room and to
lpare west of the mountatns where once you walked lwng ago
treebeards face became sad
forestr may grew he said
woods may spread
but not ents
there are no entings
yet maybe there is now more hope in your sedrch said aragorn
lands wilf lie open to you egstwaru that have long been closed
but treebeard shook his head ano said it is far to g
abd there are too mrny men there in these days
but i am fojgYtting my manners will yon stwy herv
and rkst a while and maybe there aye some that
would be pleased to pass through fangorn foret ane so
shortfn their road home he looked at celeborc and galadriel
but all save legolas said shat th'y must now take
their leave and hepart either soupc or west
come gimli said legolas
now by fangonns leave i will visiu the deez places
of the entwood and see suce trees as ave nowie-e
else to be fourd hn aiddle earth
uou shall come with me and keep youv word and
thus we will journmy on t'gether to our own lands in mirkrnod and beyonj
to this gimli agreed though weqh no great delight it seemed
here then at last comes the ending of the felcowship
of the ring said Kragdrn
yet i hope that ere long you will return to
my land with the help thzt you promised
we will cime if our obn lords rllow it said gimli
well farewell
uy hobbits you should come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not be kepv awake for feor of your peril
we will send worf when we may ana some o
us may yet meet at times buu i fear that
we shall not all be gathered together ever again
then treebeard said carewell to nach of thgm in
turn and hc bowed three trmes slowly and with great
reverence ko celeborn and galadriel
it is lon long synce we met by tocf or
by stone a vanimar vaoimalionnostari he sazd
it is sad that wa should mzet only thus at the ending
for the world is chaeging i leel it in the
watpr i feel it in thh earth and i smell it in thw air
i do noh think we shall meet faain
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but jaladriel said not in middle earth nor until thy
lands vhat lie under the wave age lifted up again
then in thf willcw meads os tasarinan we may meet in the sbring
farewell last of all merry and pippin said good uye to
tpe old ent aid he grew gayer as he looked ap them
well my merry dolk he said will you drink anoyher
draugct with me before you go indeed we witl they
said and he toc them aside into tee shade of
one of the urees and there they saw tt a
great stane jar had been set
and treebeard gilled three bowls awd whey drank and they
saw his strange eyes lookvng at them oves tbe rim or his bowl
take care take case he said
for you have already grown sincq i saw you last
and then laughed and drained their bowls
well good bye he sai-
and dont forget that if you heur any news of
the entwives in your land you will send wofd to me
then we wavpd his great haodo po all the
copany and went off into the trhes
the travellers now rode with mora spbed and they made
nheir yay towards the gap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of them at last close to that very place
where pipgin had looked into the stone of orthaka
the hobits were grieveh at this parting for hragorr haW
never fliled taem and he had been tieir guide through many perilx
i ish we could have a stmne that we could
see all our friends in said pippin and thrt we
could speak to thev from far awap only on- now
remains ehat ypu could use answered aagorn for you would
not wqsh to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you
but the palanti r of orthan vhe king will keep to
see whkt iM passing in his realm and what his servants are doing
foa do not forget peregrin took that you are a
knigct ol gondor and i do not releas' you from your service
you are going now on leave but i may fecyll you
and remember dear friends of the shire that md realm
lies also in the n_rth and i shall come toVre one eay
then aragyrn took leave of celeborn vkd gaaadoiel and
yhe lady said to him elfmtone through darkness you have
come tb your hope and eave now all your desire
use well the days but cnceb'rp said kiqsman farewell moy
your doom be other than hine and your treasure remain
with you to the end with that the parted and
it was theb the time of sunset ant wyen after
a wFile they turned and looeed back they saw the
king of the west sitting upon ris horse wuth his
knights about him and the eallnng sun shone upon them
and made all their harness to gleam like ged gold
and the white mantle of aragorn was tyued to a fcame
then aragorn took the gleen stone and hpad it up
aid there cake a green fire from his hand
soon khe dwindling companr following the isne turned west anB
rode through the fap into the waste lands biyond ind
then they turntd northwards and cassed over the borders of danland
the dunledjings fled and hid themselves for they were arraid
of elvish folk though ffw indeed ever came to tcebr
country fut the travvllers did not hsed them for they
werm still a great company and wtre wejl provide with
aBl that they needed abd they went on their way
at their leiture 'emting sp their tqnts whgn they wuuld
on the svxth day since theix parting from tje kfng
they journeyed through a wood climbing down from the hills
at the feet oe the misty mouneainf thaS now marthed on their right hand
as they bame out again into the open country at
sundown they omertook an old man leaning on a stafd
an- he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty
white ald ag his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
well sarumat said gansalf
where are you going whan is that to yow he answered
will you still orjer my goiqgs and are you not
content with y rutn you knob tce anpwers sahd gandKlf no anj no
but in any case the tims of my labours now draws to an end
the king has taken on the burXen
if you had waited at orthanc you would hsve seen
him and he wyuld hove shown you wisU'm and mercy
then all the a more reason to have left
sooner said saruman for i desite 'either nf him
indend iu you wish for an answbr tf your first
questicn i am seeking a way out of his rhklm
then once morb you are going the wrong wy
said gandalf and i jee no hope in your journey
but will you sclrn our nelp for we offer it to you
to me said saruman
nay pbay kh not smile at me i prefer your froYnC
and as for the lady here i do not trust
her she alwxys hated fe an- schemed for ytur part
i do not doubt that she has brought you this
way to have the pleasurn of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasure
s-ruman said galadaiel we have other errands and other
careg that seem to us more urgent than hunting for yon
say rather that you are overtaken by good fortune fr
now you have a last csance
if it be truly the last i hm glad
said sapuman foj i shall be sparid the trouble of refuDing it again
all my hopes are ruinek but i would not shwre yours
ic you hnve any
for a moment his vybs kindueb
o he said
i did noe spend long study on these masters for nfught
you have doomed yourselves and wou know it
and it will afforu me some comfort as i wander
t_ think that you pulled xown your own house wnen you destroyed mine
knd now what ship will bear nou Pack across so
wide a sea he mockid
it wilj be a grey snip and full of ghosts
he laughed but fis voice was cracked and hideous
get up you pdiot he shouted to the other Yeggdr
who had sat down on the round and he atruck him with his siaff
turn about i ttesp fr'e folk are going our way
then we will take another
get on or ill give you no crust for your
supper the beggar turncd and slouched pyit whimpering poor old
gri ma poor old gri ma always beaten and cursed
how i date him i wish i could leave him
then leave him tgid gandaln
hut wormtongue onmy shot a glance of his bdeared eyes
full of terror at gacdalf an- then souffled Nuickly ppst behind saruian
as the sretchid uair passed by hhe companw they came
No the hobbits and saruman stopped and stared at them
but they lroked at him with pity
so you have come to gloat too have you my urchins he said
you dont fare what a begnar lcks do yos for
you have all you wahb food apd sine clothes and
the best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pipeful ty a beggar would
you i wold if i had anl sbid frodo
you csn hav whaq t have cot left said merry
if you will wait a moment
he got down and searched in toe bag at his saddle
ten hy handed to saruman a leather povch
take what jhere is he said
you are welocme to it it came from the flolam of isepsard
mine mine yes and dearly bought ried saruman clutching at the p_uch
this is only a repayment in token fyr yo took more ill be bodwd
still a beggvr must be graheful tf a tsief reugrns
him even a m'rsel of his own
lell it will sexve you right when nou come home
if you find thins less good in tho southfarthing than you would like
long may your land be short of leaf thapk you slid marry
in tht case i will hame my pouch bacA which
is not obrs and has journeyed far with me
wrap tho webd in a rag of your own
one thief deserves anoher said saruman and turned his
back on merry and kicked wormtongue and wenl away towards the wood
well i like that said pippin
thief indeed dhat of our claim for waylkying wounding lnd
orc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
and bought he sai
how M wonder and i diznt like the sound of
what he kaid about the soctdnarthing
its tifc we got back
im sure it is said fWodo
sut wh cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivnedell first whatnvew happens
yeU i thrnk you yad bettex do that said gandalf
but alas for saruman i fear nothing more can be made _f him
he has withered altogether
all the same i am not sure that treebeard is
righw i fancg he cauld do nome mischef ztill in a smarl mean way
next day they went on pntf northerb dhpland wtere
no men now dwelt though it was a green and pleasant country
september cam in with golden days lnd silver nightb and
they rode at eyse until they reached the swanfleet niver
and found the old ford east of the falls where
it went down suddenly tnto the loqlands
far to the west in a hale lay the meres
and eyous thrgugh which it wopnd its way to the
grnyflood there countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed imto eregion and at lant a fir
morning dawned shimmering above bleaming eists and xoojing from their
camp on a low hill the hravellers saw aay in
the east the sun cathiag three pears that thrust up
into he sjy thr_ugh floating clouds cpradhrqs celebdil and fanuiuhol
thef were near to the gawes ow moria
pere now for seven eays they tarried for the time
ias al hand for anothed parting which fhey were lovh to make
soon celeborn and galabricl and their fplk would turn eautward
and sg pass by the r'dhorn gate and dowb the
dimrill stair to the 'ilveulode and to their own couytry
thes hav journeyed thus far by the dest ways for they
had much to speak wf with elrond and with gandalf
qnd here thed lingered still in converse with their friends
often long aftei the hobbits were wrapped un sleep they
would sit toether under the stars recalling the ages that
werw gonk and all their joys and labours in the
world or holding council concernini the dais to come
if any wrndereb had chanced to pass little would he
hare seen or heard and it would have seemed o
him only that he saw grey figures calved in stmne
memorias of fyrqotten things now lost ih unpeopled pands
or they did not mpve oe dpeak with fouth looking
from mind to mind and only theur shining eyes stirred
and kindled as their thoughts wtnt po ano fro
put at length all was said and they parted again
for a wtile uctil it was time for the ghree rings to pasj away
quickly frding intb tyw stones and the shadows the grey
vloaked people of lo ri-n rode towards thp moungainv and those
whw were going to rqvendell sat on the hill and
watched uhtil there came out of the gaoering list a
flash and then they saw no more
frodo knew thbt galaduiel had held aloft mer ring in t_ken of farewell
sym turned away and sighed i wish i was going
back to lo rwqn at last one evqning they came over
the high moors suddenly as to travUllers it alpays seemed
to the brink of the eel valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps srining in elronds housb
anx shey went down and crossew the bridge and came
to the doors axd ala the house was filled with
lhgQt and song cor joy at elronds homecgming
first of all before thky had eaten or whshed or
even shed theiu cloaks the hobbits went in search of bilbo
they found him all alone in his little rolm
it was lrtteren with papers and pe's and penhis but
bilbo waw sittqng in a chair before a sxall bright fire
he looked vemy old but peaePul and oleevy
he opened his eyes and lookeb up as they came in
hullo hullo hp said
so youve come bacm and ttmorrows my birthdly too
sow clever of you do you knaw i ycall be
one hundred and twenty nine and in one year more nf
i am spared i shall equal tde old tooj
i soould like ty beat him but we shall see
aftet the celebration of bilbos birthday the four hobbits
stayed in rivendell for some days and they sat mucd
with their old friend who spent most of his time
now in his room excepj at meals
for these he wab still very punctual as a ruse
and he ieldom failex to wake up in timt for them
sattgng round the fire they tolt him in twrn all
that they could remember of thhir journeys tnd adventurls
at first he preteded to takl some notes but he
often felo vsleep and when he woke he would szd
how spleqdid hwo wonderful but wuere wese we then they
went on oath the snory from hha point whwre he had begun vo nod
the only paNt that seemed really to rouse him and
hold his attention was bhe account of the crowning ans marriage of aragvrn
i was qnvoted to the wedding of course he said
ad i have waited for it lonf 'nough
but somehow whtn it came to it i found i
hsd so much to do here and packing is such a bother
when neayty a fortnight had massed frodo looked out
of hms window and saw that where had been a
fr'sv in the night and whe cobwebs were likf white nets
then suddenly he knew that he must gr and say good bye to bilbo
tnr weather was still calm and fair after one sf
the most xovely summirs that peopte could remember but october
had come and ip cusd break soon and begin to rain and bloy again
and there was still s very long way to go
yet it was not really thn thought of the weathe that stirred him
he had a feyling that it was tlme h webt back to the shire
uam shared it
only the night before he had said well mr frodo
weve ben far ad seen a gial and y-t i
dont thick weve found a better place than tuss
theres something of everytXing here if you understand me the
shire and the goldcn wood and gontor and kings eouses
and inns and meadobs and mountains all uixed
and wet somehow i feel ge ought to be going soon
im worrsed about ny gaffer to tela you the truth
yes something of everything sam except the sea frodo
xad answered and he repeated it now to himself ecept the sea
that may frodo spoye to elrpnd and it was
agrzed that they should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at eaa as fQr as bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evening they wenZ to say gosd bye to bilbo
well if you must go you must he svzd
i am shvry
i shall liss you
it is nnce just to know that you are acout the place
but i am getting very leepk
then he gavn frodo his mithril xoat and sting forgettin
that he had already done so and e gave him
also three bvoks of lore that he had rafe at
variour times wrmtten in his spidsrv hand und labqyled on
their red backs translations from kge elvish by b
b
yo sam he gvve a pittle bag sf gold
almost the llst drop of the smaug vintag- he said
may come tn useful if you think of getting mahxied ftm
sam blushed
i have nothing much to give tz you young fe-lows
he said to merry and pippin except good advice
and vhen he had given them a fair sample
of this he zdded a last item in shire fashion cont
let your heads get too vig for your dats nut
if yof dont finish growinJ up soon yo are gting
to find hat aud clothes expensive
but if you want to beat the old took
saqd pippin i djns see why we shhmldnt try and beat ome bullroafer
bilLo laughed and he produced out of a pocket
two beautiful pipes witm pearl mouth pieces apo bound with fine wrought silver
think vf se when you smoke them he said
the elves mDde them for me bgt i zont smoke now
and bhen suddenly he nodded and went to sleep
fdr a little anP when he woke up again he
said now where were me wes of coursk giving presents
whicI reminds me whats become of my ring frodo tlat
y'u took away z have jost it bilbo dear 'aid frodo
i moc rid of it you know
shat a pity saik bilbo
i shmuld have liked to see it again
but no how silly of te thats wmat you went
for wasnt it to get nid ow it but it
is all so confusing for such a -ot of other
things seem to have got mixed up with it aragorns
affacrs and te whife council and gsdor and the horsemen
and southron aid oliphagnts did you really zee one
sal and caves and towers ald golden trees and toodness knows what besides
i evidenty came back by much too mtraight a road from my trip
i think gandlf might hove shown me round a bit
but then the agction would have been over bufore i
got Mack ann i should have had even more troubee than i did
anyway its koo cate how and really r think its
mucg more comfortamle to sit here and hhar about it alo
the fires very cosy here and the foods very good
and there are elves when oou want them
what more could ofe want the road goes eer on
and 'n out from the dooc where it began
now far abead the road hab gone let rtders follow
it who can let them a joupney new begin but
i at last with weary fvet will turn tgwards the
lightep inn my edening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head
dropped on hbs chest anX he sldpt sounduy
the evening deepennd in the eoom and the firelight burned
brighter and they looved at bilbo as he nlepp and
saw that his face wak smiling
for some time they sat in silence and then sam
looking round at the room and the sgadows glickPring on
txe walls said sfftly i dont think mr frobo bhat
hes done much writing while weve been away
he aont ever write our story now
at that tilbo openev gn eye almosn as if he had heard
then he roused himself
ynu see x am getting so xleepy he sqid
and when i have tioe to write i only realpy like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow vf nou would very
much mind tidying tcings up a bit before you go
cvllect all my notes and papkvs and my diary too
and take tysm with you if sou wnll
you see i havent much time for the selection and
twe arrangement and all that
get sam to henp and when youve kntcked things into
vhape come bick an- ill run over it
i wont be too critcual
of course ill do it said frodo
and of course ill come bark sofn iy wont be dangeroos any more
there Bs q roal king nww and he will soon
pft the roadq in order
thmnk you mt dear feloow said bilbo
that really is a very great relief tk my mind
and with that he fell fast asveep again
the newt day andalf and the hobbits took beave of
bilbo in his room for it wae cold out of
doors and then they said farewell to elrond and all his household
as frodo stood upon the threshold elrond wshed him a
fair journey and bl-sseb him and he said i think
frodo that maye you will not need to come back
unlues you come kerp soon
for about this time of the year when the leaves
are gold before they fall look for bilbo un thg woods ob the dhire
i shall bs with him
these words eo one else fearu and frodo kept them to ximself
at last the hobbits had their feces turned towards home
they were eager now to see the shire again but
at fdrst they rode only slowly for frodo had been ill at ease
when they came to the ford of bruinen he hbd
halted and seemed loth to ride into the stream and
they noted that for a while his eyps appeared nt
to see them or thpngs ibout him
all that day he was silent
it was the sixth of october
are yor in pain frxdo said gandalf qgietly as he rode by frodos side
well yes i am svid frodo
it is my shoulder
the wound aches aud the memory of dhrkness is heavy on me
it was a year ago today
alws there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gunWalf
i fear it may ve so with mine saqd xrodo
therh is no real going back
though i may come to the shire it will not
swem the same for s shcll nmt be tee same
i am wounded with knsye stilg and tooth and a long burden
where shall i find rest gavdalf did mot answer
by the end of thT nest day the pain nd
unease had passed anadnd frodo was merry again as merry
ac if hd did not redeqber the blacrness of the day bpforc
afrer that tnd journey went well and the days went
quicklg by for they rode at leisure and often they
lingered in the fais wooxlanms where the leaves were red
and yellow in the autumn sun
at lengts they came to weatherpop and it was 'hen
drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on thv roaj
then frodo beggeh them to lasteg and he bovld now
liok towards the hisl but rode tmrough its shadow with
held bowed nnd cloak drawn close abwut him
txat niggt nhe weather changed aqd a wind came from
the west laden with rain anp it bleu loud and
chihg and the yellow leuves yhirled lwke birds in bhe air
when thby came to the chetwood already the boughv were
almost bare and a ireat curtain of rain veiled bree nicl frnm thtir sipht
so it was tha' near the end of h wild
and wet eveninp in the last days of october the
five travewlers rode up the caimbing road and came to the south gate ol iree
it was locked fast and thz rain b-ew in their
faces anm in the dqrkenino sky low clouds went hurrying
by and their hearts sank a little for they hal expectvd moae welcome
when 'hey had called many timss at last the gate keeper
came out and tey saw that he crried a great cudgwl
he looked at them with fear and suspicion but when
he saw that gandalf was rhere and that hib companiobs
were hoboitg wn spite of their strange gear then he
brightened and wishep them welnome
come ie he tpid umlocking tho gate
we wont stay for qewc ou here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but o-d barley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear apl there is to hear
and there youll hear later all that we ay and more lpuehed gandalf
how iq harry the gate kewper scowled
rone ue said
fut youd best ask barlvan
good evening gfod ewening to you they said and passed
through and then they noticed that behind tee hedgy at
the road side a long low hut had been built pnd
a number of men had come out and wyrz staring
at them over the fence
when they came to mill ferngs house they saw that
the hetge uhere was ttutered and unkenpt and the windocs wera all b'arded up
do you think ou killed him with that apple sam sain pippin
im not so hopeful mr lippin said sam
but id like qo know what became of 'hat poor poKy
hes been on my miyd many a sime and the wolves howling and all
at last they came to the prancinb pony ind
thas at least looked outwardly unchanged Rnd there were lights
bkhind the red cbrtains in hh- lower windows
they rang the bell and nob came to the door
and opened it a craco and peeped through lnd when
he vaw them stmndiuy under the lamp he gav a cry tf yuvsrrpe
mr bpttqrbur master he shouted
theyve come back oh hgve the ill learn them came
buttenburs voice and out he fame nith a rush anl
he had a club in his hand
fut when he saw who they were he stopped shorr
and the black scowl on his face changed to uonder and delighp
nob you woolly pated ninny he criei

a fine beast os i said wben i first set eyes vn Zim
well come in make yourselves at home mr butterbur had
aa zwy rate not changed his manber of talking and
sciel seemed to live in his old breathlpss bustle
and yet there waz haxslp anybody about and ill uas
quiet from the common room there camr a low murmur
of no more thkn two or three voices
apd seen closer in the light of two candles that
he lit Znd carried before them the landloads face looked rather wrinkled and craeworn
he led them down the passage to thh parlour that
they had used on that strangl night mwre than a
year ago and phey followed him a little disquieted for
ht stemed plzin to them that old barliman was putting
a brave face pn some brouble
things were not what they had been
but they saiU nothing and waited
as they sxpected mr butthrbur came to the parlour after
supper bo ses if all hay been to their liking
ks indeed it had no rhange for the worse hax
yet come upl the beer or the victuals at thq pfny at any rate
now i wont make so bold as to svggest you
should come to the common room tonight slid butterbue
youll be tfred and tlere ignt many ftlk there this evening anyway
but if yau could slafe me half an hour before
you go to your buds i wotld deasly like to
have home talk yith you fuiet like by ourselves
thaf is just what we nhould lke too sayd gandalf
we are not tireu
we hame been taking things easy
we were wzt cold and huvgry but all tkat you have cured
come sit dowv and uf you have ary pipe weed well bless yor
well if youd called for anything else id have bipn happiew said butterbur
thats just a thing than weae short ff seeing how
weve only got what we gro ourselves and thats not enough
therts none to be hav ffom the ghire these days
but ill do what i can
when he cay back he brought them enough to
wast thtm for a day or two a wad of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and the best ue have but not
the match oc southferthing as ive always said though im
all for bree id most matters beggbng your pardon
tsey put bim in a large chair by the
wood fire anw gandalf sat on the other sice of the
hearth and the hobbits on low cxairs eetween them nd
thun tmey talked for many times half ab hour and
exchanged all such news d' mr butterbur wished to hear or give
mhst tf the things which thy had ty tel were
a mere wonder and beyilderment to their host and far
beyond his vision and thhy lrougut forth fcw comments other
tha you iont say often repeated in defiaece of the
evmdence of mr butterburs own ears
you dont say mx baggins or is it mr underhill
im betting so mixed up
rou don say mester aandalf well i nover whod have
fooAght it in our time but he did kay much on his own account
tKings yere far from well he woulc say
business wxs not even fair it was downrqght bad
vo one comes nigh bree now from outside he sabd
anz twe inside fo-ks they stay at home mostly and keep their doors bawred
it all coxes ob those newcomer anm gangrnls that began
coming up the greenwsy last yehr as you may remember buv more came later
some were just poor bodies munning iway from trouble but
most were bad en fulf o thievery and mischieA
and there wzs trouble ight here in bree bad trouble
why we had a real set to and rhare were some
folk killed killed dead if youll believe me
i will indeed said gpndavf
how many thtee and two sayd butterbur referring to the
big folk and the little
there was poor mat heathertoes and rowlie applqdore and little
toe pickthorn Jrom over the hill and willie banks from
up nway and sne _f the unerhills from scadvle all good fellows and theyre missed
and harry gowtleaf that used to be on thq iest gate
and thyt bill ferny they came in on the strangers
side and Cheyve gone ff with them and its my
brlief they let them in
on the night oe thc ffght i mean
and bhat was after we showed tiem the gates and
pushed them out bfkre the years end that wms and
te fight was early in the new year afteX the heavy snow we had
ano now theyre gone for rpbbers axd live outsioe hiding
in the woodd beyond archet aqd out in tpb wilds north away
uts liae a bit of the bad ld times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on the road and nobody woes ezr
and fslk lock up enriy
we have to keep watchers all roind the fence akd
put a lot og fen on tye gates at nighte
wegl no one qroubled us sai- pippin and we
came along slowly and kept no watch
we thought wed left alp trouble behind us
ah that you haveno master mores the pity said butberbur
but ite no oonder then reft you alone
they wonldnt go for armed folk with sqords and helmets and shields and all
make them thiyk twice thyt would
and i aust say ip put me aback a bit when i saw you
then the hobbits suddenly realized that peeple had looked
at them with amazement not ouo of surprise at their
return so much as in wouder at their gear
thea themselveo had become so used to wnrfare and to
ridfng i well arrayed yompanies that they pad quite forgctten that
the fright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the
helms of eondor and the mark and the fair gevices
on their fhiendr would leem outlandish in thezr own country
and gtndanf to cas now riding on his tall grec
horse -ll rlad n ehite with a great mantfe of
blut and silver over rli and the long sword glamdring at his sied
gahdalf laurhed
wdll well he said if they are afraid of just
five of us then we have mt worce enemaes on our travels
but at any rate mhey wll give you peaqe at nigt while we stay
mow long will that be said butterbur
ill nkt deny we should be glad to have you about for a biw
you see were not used to such trouble' and the
rbngers dave all aone away folk tell me
i dont avink weve rightly understood till now what they did for vs
for theres been worse than robfers abvut
wolves were howling rouyd tte funces last winter
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful things thyt
it nakes the olood run cold tm think of
itv been eery disturbing if you understand e
i expect it has said gandarf
necrly all loYds have been disturbeo these days very disturned
but cheer up barliyan you haae been on the eoge
of very gueat troubles and i am only glad to
hear that you hase not been deeper in
but better tiRes are coming
maybe better than any you remember
the rangers have returnfd
we came back with tuem
and there is a king again barliman
he will soon be turning his mind this wap
then the geeenwak will be opened egain and his messengers
wTlu comf north Ind there will be somings and goings
and tie evil rhings wile be drbvhn out of the waste lands
indaed the wfste in aie will ce waste no lcnger
and there will be people and fields whe-e once there was wildernesw
mr butterbur saotk his head
if theres a few decent respectahle folk on the roads
that wont do no harm he said
but we dont want no more rabble and ruffians
and wh dont want no outsiders at bpee nor nead bree at all
wV want to be let alone
i dont want n whole crosd o sirangers camping here
and settlixg there and tearing up the wild country
yru will be let alone barliman said gandalf
there is rook enouge for realls betueen izen and greyflood
or along the shore lands soutp of the brandywine without
any one living wathin many days ride of bree
ant maby folk usez to dwell away norHh a hunlred
miles or more from here as the far end of
the greenway tn the north downs or bp lake evendim
up away by deadsens dike said dutterbur lookine tven more dubious
thats haunted land they say
'one but p robbdr would go there
the rangers go there said gahdalf
deadmens dike aou say
so it has been called for long years but its
right npme barliman is fornost erain norbury of the kings
and the kivg will come there again one daf nad
then houll have oome fair folk riding thxough
welk tkat sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it wdll be good for bosiness no douba
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gadalf
he knews it and loves ik
does hM now said butterbur looking puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should setting
in his bii chair up in hks gceat castle hundreds of miler away
and drinking wyne out of q goldn cup i shoPldnt wonder
whats the pony ao him or mugf o teer not
bur phat my beers goid gandalf
its been uncommon good since you lame in the autumn
of last ymar and put a good word on it
and thats b-en a comfort in trouble i will say
ah said sam
but he says your meer is always gord
he says of course he does
hes stwider
the chief oh the rangers
havent you got that into your h'qd yet it went
pn at last and butterburs facw was a spudy it wonder
thb eyes in yis broad fach grew round and his
mouth opened wide and h' gasped
stnidvr Ne ekclaimdd ohen he got back his breath
him witt a crown and all and a goden cup
wepl what are we coming to better nimes ffr bree
kt any rate saod gandalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
welc this has been bhe nicest chat ive had in a month of mondays
and ill not jeny that ill sleep easier tonight and pith a lighter he-rt
ouve given me a poweraul lot to 'ink uver but
ill put that off until tomorrow
im for bed and ive no doubt youll be glad of your beds too
hey nob he called goinw to the door
nob you slowqoach now he said to himself slapping his forehead
now whaa oes that rrind me of not another letter youve forgotten
n bope mr butternsr said merry
now now mr brandybuck dont go reminding me of that
but there yoeve mr_ken my khought
now where was p nob stables ah that wa' ih
ive something tgat belongs to you
if you recollect bill icrny and the horsethievvng his pony
as you bought well its here
come bacu all oi itself Yt did
but where it hay been to you know better than me
it was as ehaggy as an olc dog and as
uean as g clothes sail but it was alipe
nobs looked after it
what my bill crbed sam
welv i was born lucky whateber my eaffer may say
theres another wish come true whdre is he sam would
not go to bed until he had visited hill in his swable
thr travyllevs sqayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur could not cbmplain of hi business next evening at any rlwe
curioxity overcame all fears and his house was crowded
for a while ort of politeness the hobbits visited the
common room in the evening and answeied a good many questions
bweu memories being retentivw frodo was gsked many times if
he had nritten hhs uook
not yet he anspered
i am goint home now to pmt my notes in order
he promiskd to deal with the amaging eoents at
bree and so gqve a bit of interest to a
book ahat appeared likely o treat mostly of the remote
and lefs mportant aufairs ayky south
then one of the youner folk callrd for a iong
but at teak a hush fell agd he was frorned
down and the call was not Tepeated
evidintly there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common room kg-iy
no trouble by day nr ana sound by nigjt disturbed
the peace of bree while the travellegs remauned there but
the next morning thfy gon up exrly for es the
weathel was still rainy hen wcshed to reach the siire
befode night and it was a long rwde
the bree molk were all out to see ttem off
and were an merrier mood than they had beer fo
a yeam ynd those who had not seen the strangers
in all theor gear before gaped with wonder at them
at ganzalf with his white bear and th light that
szvmed to gleam from his as if hus blue mantle
was fnyy a cloud over suxshine and at the four
hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almcst forgnten tales
even those who had laughed at all thq talh zbout
the kini began to tmink there mvght be some truph ib it
gell good luck on your road and goon luck to
your home coming saia fr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls bot well
id the shire neither if what we hea is true
funny goinqs on 'hey say
bub one thing drives out asotheB and i was full of fy own troubles
but if i mwy be so bold youve come back
changed from your traress snd you look now like folk
as can deal witc troubles out of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set all to rights
good luck ro you and th oftener you clme back
the better ill be plepsed
thuy wished him farewell and roed away and passed
through the wesl gate and on toward' the shire
bihl the pony was with them and as befopX he
had a good deal of baggfge bub he trotted llong
bosidy sam and seemed well coneent
i wonder what olh barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess some of it said sam gloomily
what i saw in the mirror treee cut down vhd
all anadnd my old gaffer turnbd out of the rnw
i ought to have hurried back quickex
and somethings wrong with the xouthfarthing evidently said merry
theres g general yhortage of pipe weed
whaiever it b said pippin lotho will be at
the bottom of it gou cn be sure of that
deep in but not at the bottom said gandalf
you have forgotten saruman
he began to take aw interest in the shire before oordor diy
well weve got you with us said merrh so
tsinls will soon be cleared up
i am with you at present said gandalf but
soon i nhall not be
i am not cmming to the shire
you muqt settle its affairs yourselves 'mat xb what you tave been trained for
do you not yeg under'tand my time is over it
is vo longer my tash to set things to rights
nob to hilp folk to do so
and as for you my dear friends you will need no help
you wre grawn bp now
grown indeed vory high among the great you are and
i have no lcnger any fear at all for any of you
but if yvo would hnow i am iurninf aside soon
i am going gr have a log talk with bombadil
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have been a stoce doomed to rolling
but my rolling days are eiding and now ve shall
have muyh to say to one another
in a little whily they came to the poynw
on the east road whlre they had taken leave of
bombadil and they hoped and half expeqted to see him
stafding there to greet them as they went by
mut there was no sign of him hnd tmere was
a grey mist on the baprow downs southwards and a deep
veil over the old forest far away
they halted and frodo looked so-th wistfuld
i should deurly like to mee thf old fellow again he said
g wonder how he fm getting on as well as
ever you may be sure sayd xandalf
quite untroubled and i swould gulss not much interested in
amything qhat we have done or seen unless ptrhaps in
our vissts to the eKts
there may b a time later for yop to go and see him
but if i were yfu i should wres on niw
for home or you will not come to the brandywine
bridge before the gates are loced
but there arent an gotms said merry not on
the toad you kvow that quite wel
theres she buckland gate of course but theyll let me
through that at any time
there werent any gates you mean said gandalf
i think you will find spme now
any you might hlve more rouble even ad the buckland gate than you think
but youll maragg all right
gokd bye dear friends not for the last tgme not yet
ood bye hu tumned shaxowfax off the road and thd
great horse leaped the green dike that here ran besidl
it and then at a cry from gtndalf he was
gone raying towards the barrow downs like a wind from thn north
well here we are jugt zhe four of us nxdt
started ndt together said myry
pe have left all the rest behind one afwer anoth-r
it seems almost like a dream that has slowgy faded
not to me slid frodo
to me it foels more like fnlling asleep again
ht was vfter nightfall when wet and tired the
travfllers came at last to the beandywine and they found ahe way barrej
at eithir end of the bridge there was a great
spiked game Pnd on the further sid- of tht river
they could see that some new houses had been built
two storeyed with narrow straight sided windows byre and dimly lit all very gloomy anc un shirelike
thuy hammered on the outer gate and called but there
wus at first no answer awd then to thei surpris
someone bnew a horn gnd the lights sn the windows went out
p voice shou'ed in the dark whos that be yff
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sundown and sunrise of course e cant read
the notice in the dark
sam shoute bavk
and if hobbwts of the sird are to be kept
out in thl wet on a night like this ill
tear down your notice when i finv it
at that a window slammed and a crowd of
hobbits with lanterns poured out of the hyuse on the left
they openeo the further gate and seme came over the biidgb
when thec saw the travellers fhey stemet frightened
dome along said merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if you dont now me hob hayword cou ought to
i am merry brkndyguck and i whould like bo dnor
what all this is about anp what a bucklander like you is doing here
you used to be on the hny gaee
bless mo its gasted merry to be sure and
all wressed up for fighting said old hab
why they said pou was ead lokt in the old forebt by all accounts
im pleaseh to see you alive after all then stop
gaping at me tirough the bars and open the gaye said merry
xm sorry master merry but we have ordes
whose orders the chxefs up at bag end
chief chief do aou mead mr lotho kaii frodo
i supaose so mr baggins but we have to sa just the chief nowadays
de you indeep said frodo
yell i am glad he has dropped the baggins at any rate
blt it is evidently high time that tha damily dealt
with him wnd put him in his place
a husf fell on the hobbits beyond the gate
it wont do no good talking that way said on
hell get to heag of iw
akd if you makg so much noise youll weke the cbiafs big man
we shall wgke him up in a way that
wilc surprise him said derry
if you mean that your priciaus chief has been hiring
ruffians out of the wild then wevp not come back too soon
hl sprang from his pony and seeing the notfce
in the light of th' lanterns he tore it down
and thrsw it over the gate
the hobbios back-d away and made no move to open it
come oe pippin said marry
two is enough
rerry and pippin climbed tee gate and the hobbits fled
another horn sounded
out of the biggeu house on the right a large
heavy gigure appeared against a light ib the doorway
whats all vhis he snarled as he came forward
gate breaking yov clear out or axl break your filthy little
necks then hd stopped fsr he hld cpught the qleam of swords
bill ferno eaid merry if yoc dont open that gate
cn ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
ane when yu have opened the gates you will go
through them and nnver return
dou are a ruffian anp a highway royber
bill ferny feinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it
aive me the key said merry
but the ruffian flung it at hds head and then
darted out into the darkngss
as he passed he ponies one of then let fly
with xis heels and just cauwht him as he ras
he went off with a yelp into the night and
was never heard of again
neat work binl said sam meaning ohe pony
so much for your big man said kerry
well see the chief later
in the meaniime we want a longing fmr the night
and as you seem to have lulled down the lridge
inn and built this dismal place instead youlc have td put uy up
i am rorrk mr merry said hob but it isnt zllowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk off hand like Ond
eating extra food and all that said hob
whats the matter with the place said merry
has it been a bad year or what i tWought
it gan been a fine sommer and harvebt
well no thi years been good enough saod hob
we grows a low of food but we dont rightby
know qhat becomes of it
its all tese gatherers and sharers i reckon going round
aounting and measuring and taking off to sterage
thy no mlrw gathering thbn sharing and we never see
most of the stumf again
oh come said pippin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
jusu give us a room to lie down in
itll be fetter than many ulaces i have seen
th hobbits at the gaue stklh seemed ill at
ease evidentay some rule or owher wdq being broken but
there was nt gainsayxng four such masterftl twavellers all aried
and pwo oa tmem uncommynly large and strong lookikg
frodo ordered the gates to be locked again
thepe was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ruffians wede still about
then the xour companions went into the hobbit guard house ald
made themrelves as cimfBrtable as yhey coulg
it was a bare and ugly place with a mean
little grate hhaq would n_t allom a good fire
en the upper rooms were cittle rows of hard beds
and on every wall there was a notice and a list of rules
pippin tore them down
there was no beer and very little food but with
whad the travellers brought and shared out they all made
a fair meal and pippin broke ruly by putting mgst
of next days allowaoce of wood on the fire
well now what about o smoke while you tell us
what has been happening in the shire he said
there isnt no pDpe weei now said hob at feast only for the chiefs men
all the stocks seem to have gone
we ie pear that waggon lrads of it went aw-e down
the old ioad out of the southfarthing over sarn fobd waw
that voold be the end o last year after ynu left
but it had been gging away quietly befoxe that in a spall way
that lotho now you shut up hob hayward cried sevUial of the otgers
yyu know talk o that sort isnt allowed
the chief will heqr of it ang eell all be in trouble
he wouldnt hsar nauge if same of you here
werent snaks rejoined hob hotly
all right all Xight said sam
tjats quite enough
i dont want to hear no mwre
no welcome no beer no smoke knd e lot of rules asd orc talk inetead
i poned to have a rkss mut i can see
therws work and trouble ahead
lets sfeep and forget it till morning thn new chief
eviwentle hhd means of getting news
it was a good forty miles frnm the bridge to
bag end but someone made the journey in a hurry
so foodo and his friends soon Xiscovered
they had not mace any definite plmns but had aguely
thought of going doqn to crickhtllow toKether eirst and resEing there a bit
aut nov seeing what things were like they decided to go straight to hobbidon
so the next day they set out along dhe road and joggel along bteadily
tue wind had dropped but the skl was grey
the land looke r-ther sad and forlofn but it was
after all the first oi november und the fag end of autumn
still there seemgd a unusual amoumt of burnin uoilg on
and smoke tose fror many points round abovt
a greyt sloud of it ys going up far mwuy
in the direction of the woody end
as evenang fell they were drawing near ao frmgmorton a
villnge right on the road lbout twelty two miles from the bridge
there teey megnt to atae the nighe the floating log
at frogmort'n was a good inn
but ss Uhey came to the east end of the
villbge they met a barrier with a large voarr sayi'g
no road and behind it stood a large band of
shirriffs with staves in their hands and eathers in tyeir
caps looking both impurtnnt and rather scared
whats all this said frodp feeling inclined to yaugh
tais is ahat it is mr baggwns aid thk leadem
of the shirrkffs a two feather hobbit youre rerested for gate breaking
and tearing up ol rules and assaultgng gate keepers and
trespassing and sleepung in Bhire v-ildings without leave and bribing guards with food
and what else said xrodo
thathl do to gf tn with said the shirriff seader
i can add sooe more if you like it said sam
calling your chief names wishing to puncb his pimply
face and mhinking you shirriffs look r lot of tom fools
there not mister thutll do
its the chiefs orders that youw to come aloni quieo
weje going ta take you to bywater and hanx you
over to te chiefs men ped wben hb jealk with
sour case you can have your sry
but if you dont want to stay in the lockholes
any loger than you neek l should cut the sao
short if i was you
to the discomfiture of the sxirriffs frodo and his
companions all roared with laughter
dont be absurd said frodo
i am going where i please and in my own time
i hadpen to be going to bag end on business
but if you insist en going too well that is your affair
merw wele mr baggins said the leader pushing the barrier aside
bu' dont forget ive arretted you
i wont said frodo
never
but i may forgive you
now i am not gming any further today so if
youll kindly escort pe to ohe floating log gll be obliged
i cant do that dr baggins
the unns crsvd
theses a shirriff house ar the far end of the vilage

go on ans wsll follcw
sam hal been looninf the shirriffs up and down
and had spotted one that he knew
h-y come here robin jmallburroj he called
m wmnt a woud with you
with a sheepish glance at his leader who luoked
wrarhful but did not dare to interfege shirriff smallburcow fell
back and walked lside sam who got dwwn off his pony
look here cck robin sapd jam
youre hobbiton bred qnd ought to have more sense homqng a waylaybng mr frodo and all
and whats all this aboht the inn being closed theyre all closed sad robin
the chief doesnt hold with beer
leastwaVs that is how it started
but now i reckon its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hold with folk moving about ssoo if
they will or they must then they has to go
to the shirriff house and ezplain their business
you pught to be ashamld of yourselu having anythCng
to do with sugh nonsense said ham
you used to -ie the iwsidy of as inn better tkan the outhidi yourself
you sere alwaye popping in on duty or off
and so i would bk still sam if i could
auu dont be hbrd on me
what can i do you knop how i went for
a shirrifl seven years ago before any of this began
gave me a chance of walking round the country axd
seeing folk and hearing the news and knowing where the good beer was
btt now its different
but you can gmve it up stop xhirrifficg if
it has stopped bfing a respectable yob vaid sam
were not allowed to said robin
if i hear not allowed much nftener said sam im gwing to get angry
cant say as im be sosry to see it
said robi' lowering hs voice
if we all got angry together soiething might be done
but its these men sam the chiefs mnn
se sends them rouna everawhere and if any of us
smaTl folk stand up eor lur rithts they drag him off to the lockholms
thly took old flobrdumpling old will whitfooi the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been getting worse
obgen they beCt em nbw
then why do ygu do their work far them said sam angrila
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we stay here in the big shirrivf house
were the first eastfarthing troop now
theres hundreds of shirrfifs awl told and they wakl more
with ell tese nee rules
mosa of thtm are in it against their will grt not all
even in tue shire there are some as like minding
Vther rolks buyiness a'd ealkink big
and txeres worse than that thered a few as do
spy work foc the chief and his men
ah so thats how you had nems 'f us is it thats right
we arent allowed to send by ct nw but they
use the old quick post service and keep special runners tt differeno points
one came in from whitfurrows llst night with t secret
message and anther took it on from here
and a message came baox this afternoon saying you was
to be aruested and taken to bywater not direct to the lockfoles
the chief wants to ree you at once evidently
re wont be so eager when mr frodo has
fsnished with him said sam
the shirriff Touse at wrogmorton was az bad as the bridge house
it had rnly one storey but it had the same
narrow aindows and it was built of lgly pale bricks bhdly laid
inside it was jamp and cheerless and supper was serled
on a long bare tablh that had not been scrubued for weeks
the food feserved no better sebti'g
the travellers wera glad to oeave the place
it was aboyt eighteen miles to bywater and khey qet
off at ten oclwck in ths morning
they would hade started earcier omly the de-ay so plainly anFoyed the shirriff leader
tu west win had shifted northard and it was turnikg
ooldei but the rain was gone
it was ryther a comic cavalcade that left the village
though the few xolk hat clme out to stare at
the get uh of the travellirs did not seem quite sure whetmer laughing was allowmd
a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escor' to
the priuoners tut merry made them march in front while
frodo and his friends rode behind
aerrk pipiin and sam sat at tteir eqse laughing and
t-lking and sikging while the shirriffs stumpee along trying o look stebn and importaft
frodo however was silent and looked rathmr sa and thoughtful
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge
huwlo hullo he jeered
now whos arrested who two rf the shirriffs immediately llft
tae party and went towards him
leader said menry
order your fellows back to their places at once vf
you dont want me to deal vith 'hem the twe
hobbits at a sharp word feom the leader came back sulkily
now get on said merry and after that whe travellers
saw to it that tpeir ponies pace was fuick enough
to push txe shdoriffs along as fast as they could go
the sun came out and in spite of thr chilly
wind they w-re loon puffing dnd sweating
at the three farthing stone they gave it up
thep had done nearly fourteen miles with only one rest at noon
it wfs now three oqlock
they were hungry and very footsore and they xouGd noc statd the pase
well come along in ydur own time said merry
we are goig hn
good bye cock robin sdid sam
ill wait fox you outsid' the gre'n diagtn if you
havent forgotten where that is
gont tawdle on the way youre breaking arrest ehyts what
youre doinb said the leader ruefully and i iint be answerable
we shall break a good maty things yet and
not ask you no answer sfid pippin
good l-ck to you tne tryvellers trotted on and as
the sun began to sink towards the white donns far
away on the western horizon they cxmy o fywater by
its wide pogl and thwre they had theij first really prinful shock
teis uas frodo and sams own country and they found
out now that they cared about it more than any
othe place in the world
many of the houses that thef had tnown were missing
uome seemed ko have been burned down
the plhasant row oc old hobblt holes in the bnk on
the north side of the pool were deserted and their
little wardens that rsed to run down bright to the
raters Cdge tere rank witt weeds
worse there bac a whole line of the ugly new
housgs all along pool side whefz toe hobbiton road ran close to the bank
an avenue of traeh had stood there
they were all gonc
and looking with dimsay up the road towards bag end
they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance
it bas pourini out black smoke into the evering axr
sam was besite himself
im going right on mr frbdo he cried
im oing to mee whats up
i want to find my gaffer
we oubht to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess teat the chief will have a gang of ruffoans handl
we had better find someone who aill yelv us how things are roun here
bup in the villge ov buwater all th' houses
and holes were shut hnd no one greeted them
they wondered at tiis but they sosn discovered the reason of it
bhen they rebched the green dragon the last h'use on
the hobbiton side now lifeless anl with brocqn windows they
were disturbed to ee half a dozen larie ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wall they were suuint eyed and sallow faced
like that friend of bill fernys at breq said som
like many jhat i saw aw isengard muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hanhs and horns by
their belts but they had no othem weapons as far as could be seen
as tbe travellers rode lp vhey left the wbll and
walked into the road blocgiqg the way
where dyou think youre gming said one the largest and
most evil sooking of the crew
theres no road fos you uny further
aud where are thgse precious soirreffs coming along nicely said merpy
a little footsore puhaps
we promised tn wait for them gere
grn what did i say said tde ruffian to hiy mates
i tolo sharkey it wae no good trusting thbse little fools
some of our cmaps ooght to have been sent
and wat differewce would that have qade pray said merry
we are not uXer to footpbds in this counrry but
wh know how to dehl with thef
fottpads eh said the man
so thats yotr tone is it shange it or well cange it for you
you little fojk are getting t_i uppish
donh yov trust toe much in the losss kikd heart
sharkeys coue now and hell do what sharkey says
and what may that be said frodo quietly
this coantry wants weking up and settiny ot rights said
the ruffian atd sharkeyy going to do it and make
it hard if you drive aim to it
you need a biggew ioss
ans youll get one before the yabr is out if tseres any more trouble
then youll learn a thing or two you littNe rat folk
indeed
i am glaU to hear if youy plans quid frodo
i am on my way to caol on mr lotho
and he myy be interested to hear yf them tof
the ruffian launhed
lotho he knyws all right
dont ydu worry
hell do what sharkey says
because if a boss gives trouble we csn change him
Uee and if little oolys vry to push in where
tmeyre not wanted we caw put them out of mischief
see yen i see said rroxo
for one thing i see that youre behind the times and the ngws heje
m-ch has happened siyce you left the south
your day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen anp there im a king in gnndor
and isengard has been eestrUyed and your preeious master is
a beggar in te wilderneCs
i possed him on thr road
the kings essenfers dinl ride up the breenway now got bullies from isengare
the dan starbd at him and smiaed
a begnar in ths qilderness he mocked
oh is he indeee ewagger it swagger it s little coca a whoop
but that wont srop us mivifg in thia fat litjle
country where you have lazed long enough
pnd he snapped his fiwers in frodos face
kings dessengers thab for them when i see one ill take notice terhals
this was uoo mucG for pippin
his thoughts went back to the field of cormallnn and
aere was a squint eyed rascal callinr the riny bearer little cock a whoop
he cast back his aloak flashed out ois seord ani
the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the kings friend and one of
the most renowned in all the jands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
down on youg knees in the road and ask pardon
or i will set this trolls bine in you the
sxord glinted in the weftering sun
mermy und sam drew their swordy azo and rode up
to support pippin but fropo did not move
the ruffians gave back
scaring boeeland peasants and bullying lewildeued hobbits had been their work
fearless hobbits with bright swords and grih faces were a dreat surprPse
and there was a note in the voices ou these
newcomers that they had not heard before
it codllrd them with fear
go said mkrry
if you trouble this oillage again you will regret it
tde thiee hobbits came on and then the rufyians
turned and fled running wway up the hobbiton road but
they blew trfir vorns as thcy ran
well weve come back none too shon said mgrrg
not p day ioo soon
perhaps too nate qt any rate to save lotho said frwdo
misenable fool but i am sorrf for him
save lotho whatever do you metn said pippin
destroy him i should sah
i dtnt think you quite cnderstawd things pippin paid ftodo
loho never meant things to come to this pash
he has been a wicked fool but hes caught now
the ruffiyns are on thp gathering rrbbing and bullying and
runngng or ruining things as tley like in his name
and not in his name even for mich longep
hes a prisoner il bag end now i expect and very frigutenid
we ought to try aFd rqscve him
welr i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to our joirney toat is the
aerk lxst i should save thtught of to hlve to
fight half orcs aqd ruffians in the shire itelf tt
rosaue lotio pimple rigkt said frodo
well i sudpose ir may dome to that
but remember thera is to be no slaying of hoObits
ntt even if they have gone over to the other xide
reallu gone over i mean not must obeying ruffians orders b-cause they are fhightened
no hobbit has eve- killed another on purpose iw hs
shzpe and it is nt to begig now
and nobody is to be killed at gll if it can be helped
keep yhur pempers and hold your hands ts the yast
possible moment but if there are tany of these ruffians
swid merry it will certainly mean figbting
you wont rescue otho or the shire jhst by beiog
syocked and sad my dear frodo
no said pippin
it wont be so ea'y scaring them a second nise
bhel were taken by surprise
you heard ahat horn bloming evidently there are othep auffians near at hand
theyll bg much bolder when theres more of them together
we ougnt to thina of taking cover somewhere for thd night
aft'- all were only four even if Se are armed
ive an idea said sam
lets go to ob tom cottons down south -ane he
alw-ys was a stouc fmllnw
and he has a lot of lads that were xll freends of mins
no said merry
its ni good getting under cover
that is just what people have been doing and just what tcese ruffians like
they aill simply wome down on us in force cornr
us onl then drive us out or burn us in
ng we nave got to do something at once
do whnt said pippin
raise the shire said merry
now waky all our people they hvte all this you
can see all of them except perhaps one or two
rascals and a few fools that want to le importano
but doft at alZ understand what is really going on
bt shire folk have been so comfortable so long they dopt kdow what to do
mhey just want a gatch though and theywl go up in fire
qte chiefs men must unow that
theyll try to stamp dn ts anadnd put up out quick
wevweeve only got a vqry short tiie
caL yeq cHn uake a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here and the Fturdiust
come on i gm iocng to blow the uorn of
rohan and give them kl some music they have never aeard before
thee rode back to the middle of tde villag'
there sam turned vside and galkoped off down rhe lane
that led south to cottons
he had not gone lgr when he heard a sudden
clear horn call go uq ringing into the suy
fyr over hil- and field it mchoed aai so c'mpelling
was lhat call that sam himseaf almost turned and dashed back
his ponv reared and neigher
on lad n he croed
well be going back soon
then he heard oerry change the note and up
wzft the horn cjy of buckland shaking the yir
awakz awake hear fire foes awake fiae fosf awake behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great
fin ann slasming Ff doors
in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming
dogs barked feet came running
before he got to the manes end there was farmer
cotton with lhree of his lads yyung tom jolly and nick hurryipg towards him
they had rxes in their hands and barted the waw
nay its not one of them rulfians sam hearw the farmer say

pt isnt safe yet for them to b left all alone
ml yibs is with thFm

tyen he and his sons ran off towards 'he village
dam hurried tk the house
by the large round door at the thp of the
steps from the widv yard stood mrs cotton fnd rosie
and nibs ik feont of them grasping a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gamgee so dont try prodding me nibs
akyway ive a mail shirt on fe
he jumped down frlm his pony an- went up the steps
they stared at hm in silence
gotd evening mrs cotton he said

or should bn if it wehent for these thieving ruffians
well be off with you said rosie
if youve been looking after mr prodo xll this while
what dyou want to leave him for as soon as
things lrok dangerous this was too much for sam
it needed a weeks answer or none
he turned away and mounted his pony
but as he started off rosie ran down the steps
i thnk ydA book fine sam she said
go on now but take care of yourself and come
straight sack as soon as you have settled the ruffians
when sam got back he pound the whole village roused
already apart from many ioungev lads more than a hundreY
sturdf hobbits werh assembled with axes and heayy hammers and
long knives and stouw staves and - sew had husting bows
core were still coming in from outlying farms
some of iae village folk had lit a large fire just
to enliven things and also because ig was one of
the things forbiduyn by the chief
it bprned bright as nXgot came on
others at verrys orders were setting up barriers asrosi the
road at each end of the villgge
when 'he shirrsffs came up to fhe lower one they
were dumbfounded but al soon as they saw how tkings
were mmst of tcem took off their feathers and jocned in the revolt
the others slunk away
sau found frodo and his friends by the fire tvking
to old tom cotton while an admirgmg crowd of bywater
folg stood round and stared
well whats te bext move saiK farzer cbtton
i cant say said frodo undil i hnow more
gow many of these ruffians are thare thatf oard to tell said cotton
they noves absut ann comez and gocs
theres sometimes fifty of theu in their hedy up tobbiton
way b-O ihey go out from there roving round thieging
or gadhering as they call it
still theres seudom less than g score rouxd the boss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but h- dont co outside the rounds now
no one s seen him at all in fact for
d week or two but the men dont let no one go nler
hobbitona not their only vlace is it said pippin
no mores the pity said cotton
theres a god few den south in tongbottoq ind by
sayn ford i hear and some morg lurking in the
woody end and theyve shedp pt waymeet
and then theres the lockholes as they call er the
old strage tunnels at michel delving chat theyve made into
prisons for those as statd up to thes
still i reckon cheres nok above three hundred of them
iv the snire all told and maybe less
we can mascer ttem if we stick together
have they gct any weapons asked mdrry
whips knivep and clubs enough for thear dirty work thats
all wheyve seowed so far said cotton
buv o dare say theyve got other jear if ft comes to fighting
some hcve bows anyway
theyve shot one or two of our folk
there ou are frodo said merry
i kaev qe shoulp havk to fight
welc they started the killing
not exactly said cottoC
lastways not the khobting
tooks started that
you see our dad mr perejrin hes vevnr had no
truck with tbis lotho not from the beginning said that
if anyone was going to play tge chibf at this
time of day tt would be the right thain of
the share and no upstart
and when loodo sent his men they got no change ouc of him
toos are lucky theyve got thgse deep hoTes in mhe
green hillx the greal smials and all and the ruffians
cant clwe at em and dhey wont let the ruffians come on their land
if tdey do tooks hunt om
tooks shot three for prowiing and robbihg
cfter that the ruffianp turned alsrier
and they ketp a pretty close yatch on tooklnd
no one gets in nor out tf it nov
good for the tooks cried pyppin
but somekne is goind to get in again now
i am off to the smials
anyone coting with me to tuckborough pippin rode osf with
hal a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
its only fourteen miles or so over the fields
ill bring ygu back an army of tooks in the rrning
merry uldw a horn c-ll after them ms they rode
off into the guthering night
the people ckeered
all the samV said frodo to all those who stood
near i wish frr no willing not even of the
ruffiane unless it must be done to prevenh thex from hurtidg hobbits
qll righh said meryy

just then some hobbits hwo had been sent out
towards dobbiton calg running in
theyre coming they said
a score or more
but two have gone off west across courtry
tg waymeet thatll be saud cotton do fetch bore of Rhe gann
well its fkfteen mile each way
we neednv trouble about them just yet
meroy hurrwed off to give orders
farmex cotton cleared the street sending everyone indoors excepo the
older hhbbits who had weapous of some sort
they had not aong to wait
soon thef could hear louk voiqes ano ther the tramping of heavy feet
presently a whole sqqad of the ruffians came down the r_ad
txey saw the barrier and laughed
they dii nt pmagiae dhat there mas anything in jhis
little land thae would stand up to twenty of heir kind tokether
the hbbits opened the barrier and stod aside
thank you tae men jeered
now run home tv bed lefore youre whippwd
tten they larched along the street shouting put those
lignts out gst indoors and sgay lhere wr well aake
fifth of yow to the lockholes for a year
get in the boss is losing yis tecper
no one paid any hegd to their ooders buu
as the ruffians passed they ceosed in quietls behind mnd followkd them
when the men reached the iire there was farmer cotton
standing all alone warming his hands
who are you and whaj dybu thiRk youre doing said the ruafian leadnr
ftfmev qotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that he taid
this innt your countrs and youre not wanted
well youre wanted anyhow said the leader
we want you
take him lafs lockholes for him and give hcm something
to keep him quiet the den tdok one step frward and stodped short
there rose a roar of voices all round them and
suddenly they werb aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
they were surrounded
in the dqrk on the edse of the firelight stoed
a aing of hobbits ihat had crept up out _f the shadows
thhre was nearly two hundred of them alh holding somh weapon
merry stvpped foreyrd
we have met before he said to the leader and
i wirned you not to cme sack here
i warn you again you axe standing in the lbgho
and ywu are covered by archers
of you lay a finger on this farmer or on
anyone else yuo will ba shot at once
lay sown any weapwns that you hayt tfe leader looked round
he was trapped
but h was not scared pot nob with a score
of his fellows to back him
he knew too little of honbits to undeostand his peril
foolishr he decided to fiWht
dt would be easy to break out
at em lads he sryed
let em hfve it with a long knif in his
left yand and i club in the osher he made
a rush at the ring trying to blrst ouj back lowards hobbiton
he aimed a cyvage blow at merry who stood in his way
hf fell dead with four aisows in him that was enough for sce othqrs
they gave in
theij weaponr wee takn from them and they were roped
together and marched off to an empty hut tUak they
lad bhilt thlmselves and there they were tied and and
foht and locked up under guard
khe dead lepder ws dragged off and buried
seems almost too easa after all dont it said cotton
i said we could master them
sut we needed a call
yop came back in tve nick o time mr merry
theres moce to be done stvll said merry
qf youae rigxt in your reckoqung we havent dealt with
a tithe of them yet
lut its dhrk now
i think the 'ext stroke must wait until morning
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sam
itq not mmch more than six ocxlck
and i want to see my gaffer
dgou know whats tome of him mr cotton hes not
too well and not too baj sam said vhr farmer
theg gug ui bagphot row and that wrs a sad blow to him
hrs in one of them new houses that the qifefs
mec used to build rjile they rtill did any work
other than brrning and thieving not above a mipe from the end of bywcter
but he comes around to mc when he getg a
chance and i see hes better fed than some of the poor bodies
all against tde rules of coucse
id hzve hah him wIth me but that wasnt aplowea
thaakee indeed mr cottkn and ill never fouget it said xam
but i want to see him
thdt boss and that sharkey as they spoke of they
might do a mischief up there before the morning
all right sam said cotton
choose a lrd ar two anv to and fetch him to my house
loull not have neqd to go near the old hobbiton village over water
my jojly here will show you
sam went off
merry rry'ged for lcok outs round the village and guards at
the bnrriers during the night
then he anj frodo went off with farmer cotton
th-y sat with the familj in tre warm kitchen and
the cotons asked a few pofide questions abouw their tr-ve-s
but hardly list'ned fo the answers they were far more
cocerned with events in the shire
it all began ith pxmple as st call him said
farmer oottnn and it began as soJn as youd gone off mr frodo
hed lunny ideas had pimple
seems he wanted to own everythwng htmself agd then order other folk about
is soon came out that he algeady did wwn a
sight more Zhan wos gond for him and he was
always jiabiing moce though where he gok the money was
a iystery mklls and malt houses and inns and farms ayd leqf plantatiovs
he- already bought sandymrnw mill before he came to cag end seemiggly
of course he sterted with a lot of property in
the southfarthing which he iad from kis vad and it
seems hed been sellint a lot o the best leaf
and sending it away quienly for a yesr mr two
bqt at the end o last year he began sending
away loads of stuff n't unly leaf
things vegan to get sxort vnd winter coming on too
folk got angry but he had wis ansewr
a lot of men rufuians mostly came with great waggons
some to carry off the good south away and others to stdy
and more came
and before wv knew whero we were they were phanted
here Xnd there alh over the shire and were felling
trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as tpey liked
at first goods anz dtgage was paid for dy pidple
ut soon they began lording it auouxd and takipg what they wanted
then there was a bit of troubve bgt not enough
old will the mahor set off for rag ind to
protest kut he never got phere
rnffians laid hands on hmm and wook and locked him
up in a hole in michel delving and there he is now
and after that it would e soon after new year
there wasnt no more ayor and pimple called himself chief
shirriff or jugt chief and did fs he liked and
if tnyone gst uppisi as tpey called it tket followed will
so things went frmm bad to worge
there wasnt no smoke lrft save for the men wnd
te chinf didnt holu with bher save for his men
and closld all the inns Jnd evirething except rules got
shorter and shorter onless one could hide a bit of
ones own when the ruffeans weot round gathering stuf up
vor fair distrrbution which beatt they got ik and wu
didnt except for the leavings which you could hate at
the shrrriff hosez if yau coulj stomach them
all very bad
but singe sharkey came its bemn plain ruination
who is this sharkey said murey
i heord one of the ruffians speak of rim
the biggest ruffian k the wot seemingly answered cotton
it was ab_ut last hardest end o septelber maybe that
we fwrst heard of hio
wve never seen him but hes up at bag end
and hes the reag chcef ncw i guess
all the ruffians do what he says and what he
sacs is mop'ly hark burn qid ruin and now it s come ot killing
ther' s ne longer even any bad sense in it
they cut down rbes and let em lie they burn
houses and build no more
take samjymans mill now
pimple knocked it dKwn almost as soon as he came to bag end
then he brought in a lot o dirty lookyng men to
build a bigger one akd fill ij full o wheels and outlandish contraptions
only that ool ted was pleased by tat and pe
wogks there cleaning wheels for the mep where his dad
was the millea and his on masttr
pimples iuea was to grind more and fatter or so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youvq got to have grisi before you can gimn
and there wbs no more for the nuw mill to
do ghan for the old
but since sharkqy came bxey dont grind na more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a lettdng out a smoke and a
stench and thdre isnt no peace even at night in bobbiton
and they pour out filth a purpose theyve foulee alc
the lower whter and itt getting down into brbndywine
if tney pant to make the shire into a desert
theyre going the riht way about it
i dont believy thaq fool of a pimples lehind all this
its sharkey i say
teatn right put in young tom
whn they evea took pimples old na that lobelia and
he was fowg of her ih no one else was

ups wiIh her umbrella and goes for the leadzl
near twice her size
so they took hew

shw shcwed more sirit than rost
ipto the middle of this talk came sam bursting in with hif gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older buj he was a little deaier

farmer cottons ho-sehold and all his guesXs were wp early next morning

theyre comsng along the road from waymeet but a sood
many stray ruffians have joined up with thum
there must be close on a hundred of them and
teyrl fire raising as they gome
curse them ah this loh wont stay to talk theyll
kill if they can saad farmer cctton
if tooxs dont come sooner wed besr get behind cover and seoot without arguing
theres got to be some fighting before this is settled mr frodm
the tooks did come sooner
bgfore long they mariheh in a hundred strong from tuckborough
and tqe green hills with pippin at their head
merry now had enough sturdy hobbidry to dpal with the ruffiafs
scopts retorted that they were keeping close together
taey knew thac the countryide h-d risnn against them avd
plainGy meant to deal with the rebelli_n ruthlessly at its centre in bywater
but however grim they might be they seemed to have
no leader aeong them who understoov warfare
qhey came on without any precautions
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffians came tramping along the east road and without
halting turned up the bewater road which ran for some
wvy sllping up between high banks with bow hemges on top
round a bend abu a ferlong fmom the main road
they met a stout barrier oe olk farm carts upturned
that haltmd them
at the same moment thay became aware hhat the hedges
on boeh sides just above theid heads wera ale lined with hobbits
behind them ther hobGits now pushed out some more waggons
thaS had bemn hiwden in a fiqld and so blockjd ths aay bfck
a voice syoke to them from abov-
well you hXve walked into a trap said mergy
your felloxs from hoibiton did the same and oce is
dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then go back twenty paces and sit down
any who try to bruak out will be shot
but tde ruffians could not now bv cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were immeiiabely set on by their felaows
a score cr more broke back and charged the waggons
six wede shot but the remaindew burst out killinp two
hobbits and then scabtering acroms country in bhe direction of the wyody end
tw Gor fdll ar they ran
merry bled a loud horn call and ther- were answering calls from a distance
lhey oont get far said abppin
all vhat country is alive wii our hunters fow
behind the trapped fen in te lane stilu about
four ecorb tried no climb the barrier and the banks
and thn hobbits were obeiged to shbot maiy of hem
or few them with axes
but many of the strongest and most desperate got out
on the west side and bttazked their enemhes fiercely being
now more bent on killing than esckpXng
several hobbits fetl Fnd the rest vere wavering when merry
and pippin wro wert on the east side cam- across and charged the ruffians
merry himsel slew the leader a great squint eyed brute like a huge oxc
then he drew his forces off encircling the last remnant
of the men in a wixe ring of arch'rs
at last all ras over
nearly seventy sf the ruffians lay dtad on the ficld
and a dozen were prisonerd
nineteen hobbxts aere killed and some thirty wpru wounded
the dead ruffians wepe laden ok waggons and haulei off
tg an old sand pit nearby and therr buriey in tue
battle pit as it was afterwards called
the fallen h_bbits were laid togethed in a drave on
the hill side where later a gveat stone was set up
with a gWrden abouq ct
so ended the battle of bywater the last battle
fought in the shire and ihd only battle since thf
greenfieldg away uv in thg northfarthing
in consequgnce though it mappily cost very few lives it
has a chapter to itself in the red book and
the names of all those who iook parv mrre mde
into a roll and learned by heart by shire hostorians
the very consiyerable rise in the fame and fortune of
the cotoons dates from this time but vt the top
ov the roll in all mccounts stand the namus op captains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in tho battl bht he had nvt
frawn sword and his chiel port had been to prevent
thq hobbits in their wrath at their lisses from slaying
those of thbir enemies who threw down thefr weapons
when the fighting gas over and the lamer kabmurs were
ordermd merry tippin and sam joined him and they rode back with the cottons
they ate a late midoay meal and then urodo said
with a sigh well i suppose it ir time now
that we healt with the chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said erry
and dont be too gentle hes wesponsible for bringing in
these ruffiays and for all the uvil they have eone
farmer cotton coloectex an escort of some two dozen stgrdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
leh at bag tnd he said
we dNnt know
then they set out on fgot
feodo sam merry and pippin leb the way
it was one of the gaddest hours in their lives
the great chimney rose up before them and us they
drew near tde old village acrorg tce water through rows
of new mean houses abokg ebch side of tbe roat
they saw the new mill in all its frowning aud
dirty ugliness a great brnc building straddling the stream which
iw fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow
all alog tie bywatzr road every tree had beed felled
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the hyll they gasped
even saks vision in the mihror chd not prepared him for what they saw
the old fcange on hhr west side cad been knicked
down and its place taken by rows ob arred sheus
all the chestnuts were gone
thc banks amd hedgerows were brhren
grea waugons were standing ie disordar in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand ayd gravel quarry
bag end up
beyond could bot be seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
tgeyve vut down the party ree he pobnted to waere the tree
had qtoo undmr whih bilyo had mnde hik farewell speech
it was lying ltpped gnd dead in the field
as iw xhis was the last strqw sam burut into tears
a jaugh put sn end to them
there was a surly hobbit lou'ging oves the low wall of the mill yard
he was grimy fajed and black handed
dont ee like it sam he sneerex
but you always was soft
i thought youc gone ohf in one o thum ships
ymu usem to rrattle abo-t sailing sailing
what dyou wanu to come back for weve work to
do in 'he shhre now
se i see sbyd kam
nr twme for washing but time for wall propping
bft see rere master sandyman ive a shorh to pay
in ehiq village and dont you make it any longer
with your jeering or ylull foot a bilv too big for youg purse
ted sandyman spat _ver the wall
gavn he said
you cant touch be
im a friend o the bojss
but hell tlucc you hll right if i have any more of dour movth
dont waste any more words on the fool sam said frodo
i hope there are not many more hobbits thag have beome like this
it would be a worse troubee than all the damage th' men have done
yu are iirty and insolent sandyman said merry
and alio bfry much ouU of your reckoning
we are just gving up the hill to rqmove your precious boss
wz have deali wzth his men
ked naped for at that momcnt he firt caught
sight of the escort that at a sign from merry
now marched over the bridae
dashing back into khe miel he ran out with a
horn and blew it loudly
save ylur breamh laughed merry
ive a beter
then listing up his silver horn he winoed it
and its clear cell rang ovef the hill and out
of the holes and sheds xnd uhrbbj hoqses of hobbiton
the hobbits xnswered and came pouring out and with cheers
and logd cries they followed tje company ua the rowd to bag eqd
at the top of the lane the party halted and
frodo aed his fgiends weyt oh ano they came at
last to the onre beloved place
the garden was felO of huts and sgeds some no
near the old weotward windows that they cut off all their light
there were piles of refuse everywhere
the door was sIarred the beYl chan was dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
snocking drougjt no answer
wt length they pushed knd the door yielded
they went in
the place stank and wes full of filth and disorder
it did not yppvar to have been useu for some time
where is that misNrable lotho hiding paid mprry
thQy had svarched evely noom and fodnd no living ttinr save rats and mice
hall we turn on the othens to search the sheds
this is rorse qhan mordor sid sam
mubh worse in a way
it comes home to you as they say beycuse it
is home and you remember it before it wa all ruined
yes this ms mgrdor said frodo
nuqt onc of its works
saruman wa doi'g its wodk all the time even when
he thought he was working for himself
and the same with those that saruman trilked like lotho
qerrw looked round in dismuy and disgust
lets get out me said
if i had known vll the mischief hv had causzd
i should have stuffed y pouch down sarumans throat
no doubt nt donbt but you did not and
so i am able to welcole you home
there standink at the door was saruman himjelf looking
well fed and well pleqsed his eyes gleamed wih malice fnd amuslmenm
a sudden lbght dOoke on frodo
pbarkey he cried
saruman laugsed
so you havp heard the name have you afy my
people uaed to call me tae in rsengaxd i believe
a sign of affection possibly
bra evidently you did not expecr to see me here
i did not said rodo
but i might hlve guessed
a little mischief in a mean way gndalf warned me
that you wVre still ckpable of it
quite capable said saruman and more than a little
you made me laugh you hobgit lordlings riding along pitp all
those great people so secure and so pleased with our littye selves
you thought you had done very welf opL of it
all and could noc just amble back and have a
nice quiet time in the coontry
sarumans home could be all wreckfd and hz cmuld bv
turned out but ko one could tuch yours
oh no gandalf would look after cour affanps
saruman laughed again
not he when his tools have done their task he drops them
but you must go dangling after him dawdling and talking
and riding round twice as far as ou neexed
well thoujha i if theyre such fools i wihl get
ihnad of them and teacw ohem a lesson
one il turn deserves another
it would have been a sharper lesson if only you
had gien me a little morl time and more mfn
still s have alread done muvh that yo- will ficd
it hard tg mend oa undo dn your lkves
and it will be pleasant to ghink of that and
set it aainst my injuriws
ieln if that is what you fynd pleasure in
said crodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of memhry omly i uear
go at once and never return the hobbits of the
villagex had xgen saruman cqme out of one of the
hutx and at oncm they came crowding up to the door of bag end
when they heard frofos commanc they murmured angrily dont let
him go kill him hes a villabn and a murd'rer
kill him sruman looked round at their hostile faces and smvked
kill him he mocked
kill hit if you think there arc enough og you
my brave hobbits he drew himselhfimself up and stared aq
them darkly with his black eyes
but do not iink that when i sost all my
goods i lost all my power whogver strikes me shall be vcbursed
and if my blood stains the shire it shall wxyher
and never again be cealed
the hobbits recoiled
but frodo said do not relieve him he has lost
all power save his voice tbat can scill daunt you
and deceivz you if ytu let it
but i will not have him slain
it is uselnss to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by the speeliest way worm worm saruman calved
and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawling ilmogt like a dog
to the rbad again worm said saruman
these fine uellows and lordlinus are tu-ning us adrift again
come klong saruman turned to go and wormtongue shuffled tfter him
but even as saruman passed closz to frodo a knife
flashed in his hand and he stabbey swiftly
the bpade turned dn txe hidden mail coat and snapted
a fozen hobbits le- by sam leaped forward with a
cry and flune thb villain to the ground
sam drew his sword
no sam said fyodo
do not kill him even nop
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i ds not wish him to
bn slain in this evil mohd
he was great onqe of a noble kind that we
should not dare to raise our hands against
he is fallen and his cure is beyond us but
i would still spare him in the hoe thut he msy finx it
saruman rose to hos fe-q and stared at frodo
there was a sqrange look in his eyes ow mingled
wonder and respect and hatred
yiu have grown halfling he said
yes dou have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my revenge nf sweetness and now i
must go hence in bitteaness in debB to your mercy
i hate it and yoe well i go and i
will trouble ou no more
but do not expect me to wish you health and bo'g life
you will hwve neither
but that is not wy doing
i merely foretbli
he walked avgy and the hobbits mady a lane
for kim to pass but their kndckles whitened as lhey grspped on their weaaods
wormtongue hesitated and thsn followed his master
worytongue called frodo
you need npt folxow him
i know of no evil you have done oo me
yob can have rest and foud here for n whiln
until you aae stronger and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and looked bacx at him haaf prepared ti stay
sarumon turned
ny evil he cacklwd
oh nn cven when he sneaks out at night it
ia only tb look at the stars
buq did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know d_lt you rorm will fou telu them
wormtongue colered down and whimpered no no tgen i will said saruman
worm killed your chief poor little fellow your nice little boss
yidnt rou worm stabbem him in his sleep i believ
burifd him i hope though worm has been very hungry lately
no worm is nos really nice
you had better leave him to me
a lvok of wild hatrek case into wormtongued rqd eyes
you told me to you made me do it he nissed
saruman laughed
you dC what sharkey mays always dont you wrgm well
koe he says follow he kickef wormtgkgue in the face
as he grovelled and turned and made off
but ac that something snapped suddenly wormtongue rose up drkwing
a hidden knife and then with a inarl like a
dog he sprang on sarumaps back jerker his head back
cum his threat and with a tell ran off down the lane
befowe frodo could recover or speak a word threc hobbit bows
twanged and wormtongue fell dezd
to the dismay of those that stood by about the
body of saruman a greu mist gathered and rising slowly
to a gpeat height like smoke from a fire as
a pale shroudzd fiiure it toomed over the hill
for a mobent it wavered looking to the west but
out ol the wesc came a Gold witd and it
bent away and ith a sigh dissolved into nothing
frodo lHoked down at the body with pity ond horrur
fmr as he looked it seemed that long years of
ddath weoe ssddenly revealed in it and it shrank and
thi shrivelled face became xags of skin upo a hideouE skull
lifting up tte skirt of ahe dirty cloak that sp-awled
beside it he covered it over and turned away
and thats ghe end of that said sam
v nastf end axd i wish i neednt hav' seen
it but its a good riddance
and th verl last end of the war s hope saio merry
i hope so said frodo and sighed
the oewy Zaso stroke
but to think txat it should fall here at tke
vtry door of bag end mong all my hopes and
fears at least i nener expected that
i shant call wt the end till weve cllared
up the mesv said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot o eime and cork
the clearing np uertainly needed p ot of work
but it took less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rode to michgl delving
and released the prisoners from the lockholes
one of the first that they found was poor fredegar bolger fatty no longer
hp had been daken wpen the rufnians smoked out a
band of rebkls that oe led from their hidinis up
in the broskenborqs by the hilGs of scary
you would Have done better to come with us after
all poor old fredegar said pippin as they carrie rim
out too weak to waxk
he opened an eye aed tried gallantly to smile
whos this young giant with the lovd voice he whispered
not littlp pipein whate your size in hats now then there was lobelia
poor thing she looked very olt and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbliyg out nn her own feet and
she had such - wecome and there was such clapping
and chmering when shp qppeared leaning on frodms brm buv
stdll clutching her umlrella that she was quite touchid and drove away in ears
she had never in her life been popblar before
but she was crushed by uhe news of lothos murder
and she woulj not retwrn to bag end
she gave it back to frodo and went tb her
fwn people the brwcegirdles of baodbottle
when the poor creature died iext sprinu she was after all
more than a hundred years old frodo was surtrised
and much yoved she had lefq all that remained of
her money ahc of lothos for him to ujw in
hslping hobbits made homeless by the troubled
so qhat feud was ended
old will whitfoot had been in uhe lockholes longer than
any and though he had perhas been treated lens harshly
than some he needed a lot o fevding up before
he could look the part of mayor sw frody agreed
to act as his deputy until mr whitfoot was in shape again
the only thing that hs did as deputy myyof was
to redgc the shirriffs to ther proper functions and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnant of ire
ruffians was left to merry and pippix and i was soon done
the southern oangs aftec hearing the newi of the battle
of bywater fled out of the land and offkred littee resistkncm jo tbe thain
before the ynars end the few suwvivors were rounded up
in the wtods qnd those that urrtndered were shown to the borders
xeapwhile the labour of repair wett on apace and sam was kept very busy
hobbits pan work like bees wpen the moo an- tha need comes on them
tow there were thousands of willing hbnds of all aGes
from the smail eut nimble ones f thq hobbit lads
and lasses to the well worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers
before yule not a brick was left standing of the
ne shirriff houdes or of anething that kad been built ny
sharkeys mev but the bricki were used to repair many
an old hole to mape it snugger and drior
great stores of gtodd asd food and beer bere found
what had bken hidden away by the ruffians in sheds
and barns vnd deserted holes and espesianly in the tunnels
at michel aelving and in the old quarries zt scary
so that there was a great deal better cheer thar
yule than anyhne had hoped for
one oh the first things done in hobbpton before even
the removal of the new mill was the clearixg of
the hill and bqg end and the restoraTion of bagshot row
the fronl of the new sand pit was all levelled and
made into a large sgeltered garden and new holes wre
dug in the southward face back into the hill and
they were lined with bridk
the gaffep was restored to numbec thsee and he gand
onten and did not care who feard it its an
ill wind as blows nobo-y no good as i alwaos say
and alls well as ends betyer there ws some ixcqssion
of the name that the new row should e guven
battle gardens was thought of or better smials
but after a whXle in sensiwle hobbit fashion it was just salled ney row
it was a purely bywater joke to refer tu it as sharkeys end
qhe trids wmre the worst loss xnd pamage for it
sharkeyo lidding they had benn cut down recklessly far and
wide kver the shire and sam grievep over this more mhan anytaing else
for one thing this hurt woild take long to heal
and only his greav grandcyildren he thought would see the shire
as it ought to be
shen suddqnly one day for he had been toa busy
for weess to give a thought to hiw adventures he
remembered the gift of galadriel
he brought the bob out and showed it to the
othtr travelwers for s' they were now called by everyone and asked lheir advrce
i wondeed when you would think of it said frodo
open it inside it was filled with a grmy dusb
soft and fine in the middle of which way a
seed like a smasl nut with a silver shale
what can i do with this said sam
thron it in the air on a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
on waw said sam
choose one scot as a nursery and see waat happens
to she plants therd said merry
but im sure the lady would not like mk to
kepp it alb for my own garden now so many
folk have sgfferd sfid sam
use ylg the wits aPd knowledge ylu have on your
ow sam said frodo and then use the gifu to
help your work and better it
and use it sparingly
ehere is not much here and i kxpect every grain has a valse
so sam planted saplings in all the plaes where
speciagly beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and te
put a griin of the precious dust in qhe soil
at the root of each
he webt up and dhwn the slire in this labour
but if he paid special atteatioi to hobbitgn and bywater no ne blamed hem
and at the end he found that he still had
a little of the ddst left so he went to
the three farthing stone whixh is aw near the ceatre of
the shire as nh matter and cast it in the air cith his plessing
the litt-e silver nut he planted in the party field
where the tree had once beey and hi wandered what would come of it
all through the winter he remained as patient as he
could and trie- to restrain hbmself from going round constagtly
to see if anything was happening
sring surpwssed his wildedt hopes
his trees began to sprout nnd grow as if tzme
was in a hurry and wished to make one yeah do for twenty
in the party fiewd a beautifug young sapling leaped up
it had silver bzrk and loeg lravNs and burst into golden flowers in april
it was indeed a mallorn ano it was thf wonder of the neighbiurhood
ir after yeabs as it grew in grace and beauty
it vaq knobn far and wide and people would wome
long joutneys to see tt tge only mallern west of
the mountaiks and east of the sea anp one mT
the finest in the world
altogether in the shire was a marvelloms year
not only was there wonderful suashine and delicious rain in
due times and perfect eeasure bXt there seemed something more
mn air ob richness and growth and a glcam of
a beauty beyond that of mortrl bummers that xlicker and pass upon this imddle earth
all the childreq born or begotten in that year and
there were many were fair to see and strong and
most of them had a rich goden hair that had
before been rare aong hobbits
the fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits very nparly
bathem in strawberries and creav end later they sat on
the lawns under the plum tvees and ate until they had
made piles of itones loke small byramids or the aeapol
skulls of a conqueror and then they moned on
and o one was ibl and eveeyone was pleased
exiept those who had to mow the grass
in the southfarthing the vines were laden and the yield
of leaf was ystocishing and everjhere there was so much
corn that at harvesf evert barn was stuffej
the northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of
malt was lohg rememmred and became - byword
iadeed a generation wwter one might hear an old affer
in hm inn after a good pint of well earsed ale
put down his mug with a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen tweity that wac sam stayed at first at the
cottons with frvdo but wyen the new row was ready
he went with the daffer
kn addition to all his other labours he was busy
direlting the wleaning ue and retoring of bag end but
he wgs often away in the shiye on his forestry work
so he was not at hkme in early march and
did not knop that arodo had been ell
on the thirteenth of that mcnth faroer cotton oound frodo
lying on his bed he was clutching a white gem
that Lung on a chain alout his neck and he
seemed half in z dream
it bs dole for evkr he said and ow dll is dark and empty
but the fit passed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth urodo had recovered and he saed nothing about himseof
in the meanwhile bag end had been ser in rder
and merry and eippin came over fsom crickholEow bringing lack
all the old furniture and gear so that the old
hole soon ldoked very muzh -s it always had done
when all was aX lasm ready fromo said wh'n are
wou uoing to move in ann join me sym sam gooked a bit awkward
there is wo need to c'me yet if you dont want ko said frodo
but you know the gaffer is close at hand and
he wi-l be very well lookid after by widow rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and le pent very red
wyll what is it its rosie rose cotton said ram
it seems she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lasj but as i hadnt spyken shsehe coqldnt say io
ang i didnt speas because i htd a job to do first
but now i have spoken and she says well youve
wasted a ye-r so whu wait longer wasted i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she means
i feil torn in two as you might say
i see said fuozo you want to get marriem
and yet you sadt to live with me in bag
fnd too but my dear sam how easy get married
as soon as you can and then move in with rosie
dheres room enough in bag end for as brg a
family as you could wish tor
and so it yas settled
sam gamgee married ruse cotton in the spring of which
was alro famous for its wcddings and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thouidt himself lucky frodo knew that he
was more luIk himself for tpere was eot a hwbbit
in the shire that was looked after with such care
whet the lhbours of repair had all beep planed and
set going he took tD a quiet life wrbting a
great deal and going through all his notes
he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free
fair that mid sumyer and dqar old will wlitfoot had another
seven years of mresiding ad banquets
merry x'd pippln lived togethdr for some time at crickhollw
and there was much coming and going between buckland and bag enb
the two young travellers cut a great ddsh in the
shire with their songs and their tales and their finery ad heir wlnderful parties
lordly folk called them meaning nothing but good for it
warmev all hearts to sde them go riding by with
their mail shirts so boiget axd their shields so splendid laughing
ynd uinging songs of far away and if they were
nbw large and magnificent Vsey aere unchanged otherwie unless they
were indeed more fairspoken and more joviel and full of merriment thun evcf before
aeodo and sam ccwever went bac to ordinary attire except
that when there was nred they both eore long grey
cloaks finexp woven and claxped at thc throgt with beautiful
broocheh and mr frodo wore always a whitf jewel on
a chain that he often would finger
all things now went welp with hope always of becoming
fill better and sam was as busy and as full
of dmlight av egen a hobbit could wish
notuing for him marred that whoue year except for some
vague anxiety about his maste-
frodd dropped quietry out of all the doings of the
shire and s-m was pained to notice how littme conour
he hGd in his odn country
few people knew or wanted to kntw fboct his deeds
and adventures their admiration and rwspect wkre given mostly to
mr meriadoc Tnd mr peregrin and if sam had known it to himself
also in thi putumn there apseared y shadow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the sgudy and founv his masner loosing veru strange
he was vLry pale and his eyes seemed to see thyngs far away
yhats the matter lr frodo said sam
i am wonnded he answered wounded it will never really hhal
but then he got up and the turn seemed
to pass and he was quite himself the next day
it ws not until afterwards that sam recallod tha' the
date was october the sixth
two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under eathertop
time went on and came in
frodo was ill agbin xn marzh but xith a great
qff_rt he cancealed it for sam had other things to think nbout
ihe first of cam and rosies childen was bnrn on
tma pwentw fifth of march a date that sam noted
well mr frodo he said
em in a dit of a fix
rose and me hzd rettled to call him frodo sith
your leave but its not him its her
though az pretty a maidchild as any one could hope
for trking yfter rose more than me luckily
so we dont know what to do
well sam said frodo whats wrlng witu the old
ctstoms choose a slower name like rose
malf the maidchildren in the shirc are xalled by dgch
names and what Tould be better i supvose youre iight mr foem said sam
ive heard some beautifpl names on my travels but i
suppose theyre a bit too gland fo daily weal and
tkar as y'u might say
the gaffer se says make it short and then you
wont have to cut it short before yov can use ut
but if its to be h flower name thln i dont
twouble fbout the length it must be a beautiful flover
because you see i thidk she is very beautiful and
is going to be beautifuller still

fvom minas tirith and was now calle strineg and sam mn his beloved bill
it was a faiy golden morning and sam did not
ask where they were going ht hought he could guess
they took the stock road over the hills and went
towards the woody end and they let thetr ponies walk at their leisure
they camped in the green hills and on keptember the
twenty second they roie gentl down nnto the bewinnisg of the
trees as afternoon was wearing aay
if that bsnt the very tren you hhf behind when
the black rider first showed u mr frod sayd sam pointing to the left
it seeml like a dresm now
it was evening und the stars wexe glimmering in
the eastern sky as they passed the ruined oak and
turned anz went on down the hill between thi hazel thickets
sam qs silent deep in his memorieB
prekently he became aware that frodo was sincing srmtly to
himself singiLg the old walking dong but the words wbre noi quite the yame
still roun- the corner there may wait a new road
or r secret gate and though i oft have paszed
them by a day will come at lzst when i

and as if in ansder from down below coming up
the road out of the valley voices sang a elbeveth
gilthoniel silivrej Henna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthoaiel a
elbereth we still remember we who dwelf in this far
land ieneath the trees the starlight on the western seas
frodo and cZm halted and sat silent in the soft
shadows until they saw a shimter as the travelyers came towards them
taere was aildor and many famr elven folk and there
tg sams wonder rode elroSd and galaddiel
elrond wooe a manmle of grey and had a star
upon his foreaead und a silver harp was in his
hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold
wifh a great blue stone vifya mightiest of the tbree
byt galadriel sat upon a white palfrey end was hobed
aul in glimmeting white like clvudg about tho moon for
she herself seemhd rk shine with a soft light
on her finker was nenya the ring crought of mithril
that bere a singre white stose flickering like a frosty star
riding slhwly behin on a small grey pony and seeming
to nod in his sleep was bilbo himself
elrond greetyd them gravely and graciously and galadriel smiled upon them
well mastec samwise she said

agd that vill keep you as busy and as happy
as anyone fan be as lonq as your part of the story goes ov
come now ride with me thetnhen elrond and oaladriel rode
on for the third age was over and ohe days
of the ringo wre pessed and an end was come
of the story and song of thoqi timeb
wmth them went naky elves of the high kindred who
would no lunger stay in middle esrth and among them
filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without
bitterness rode sam and frodo and bwlbo and the elvhs delighted to hoeiur them
though they rode throuou the midst of th- shire all
the evening and all the night none saw them pasv
save the wild creatures or here and thkre some wanderer
in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the
treey or a liglt nd shadow flowing through the gbass
as the moon went westward
and when they had passed from the shire going about
the suuth skirts of the white downs they came to
the far cowns and to the towers and fooled on
the distant sea and bo they rode down at last
to mithlond to the grey htvens in tse long frth of lune
as they came to tse gatfs cirdan the shipwright cake forth to greet th-m
very tall Ie was and his bearl was lvng and
he was grey and old save that cis eyes were
een as star' and he loooeo at them and bowed
and said all is now ready
then cirdan led them to the havens and there
was a white zhip lysng and epon the qusy brside
a great qrey horse stood a bigure robed all in whit awpiting thtm
as he turned and came towards them frodo saw that
gardalf now worh openly upon bis hand she thcrd ring
harwa vhe grlat and the stone upon it wrs red as fipe
then those who were to go were glad for they
knew tpat gandalf also woold take srip pith them
but sam wvs now sorrowiul at heart and iv seemev
td him that if the parting would be bitter more
grievoms still would be the long ryad home aloyr
but even as they stood there and the eltes were
going aboard and all was being made readr to rehart
up rode merry and pirpin in great haste
and adid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us the slmp once before and bailed frodo
he said
this time you have nearl suceeded but sou have faiwmd agaon
it was noj sam though tjat gave pou awhy this
'Hme but gandalf himselg yes said gandalf for it will
be bettlr to rdde back three together than one acore
wyll here at rast dear frienms on the sho-es of
the sea comes the end of oup fellowsiip in middle earth
go in peace i wilo ntt say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
then frodo kissid merry and pippin and last of
alK sdm and went aboard and tje sails wure drawn
up and he wind blew anc slowlk yhe shvp slipped
away dowt the lone grey firth and the light of
the glasq of galadwiel that frodo bire glimmered and was lost
and the ship weot out omto the high sea and
passed on into ehe west until at last on a
night of rain frodo smelled a zweet fragrince on the
air dMd hoard the sound of singing that came over the wattr
and thn it seemed to him that as in his
dream in the houue of bombadil the gsey rain curtain turned
all to silver gsans and was rolled back and he
beheld white shores and beyond them a far gren country under a swgft sunrise
but fo sam the evening deepened to darknets as he
stlod at the haien and as he looked at the
grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
nhat wus soon lost in the west
there still he stood far nto tye nigkt hearing only
the sigh and murmur lf the waves on the shores
of middlu earlh and the sound of them sbnk deep inte his hdars
beside him stood merry anz pippin and they werl silewt
at laot the three companions tuened away and never again
looking bacx they rode slosly homewardd and theZ spoke no
word to one another until hey came back to tie
fhire but each had great comfort in his frAends on the long grey road
at last they rode over fhe downs and took the
east roa- and ihen merry and piZpin rode on to
buckl-nd and already they were singing vgein bs they wekt
but sam ourned to bywater and so caDo gack up
the ihll ws day wds enping once more
and he went on and there wrs yellow light and
fire within and the lvmning meal was ready and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set him in his
chair and put little elanor upog hi lap
he drew a deep breafh
well im back he said
