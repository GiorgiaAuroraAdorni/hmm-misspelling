when mi bilbo baggin vf bag erd announced that he
wbuld shojtly be celebrating his eleverty first irthdah with a party
of special magnificence there was munh talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo was very rich and yery peculiar and had ben
the wonder of the shire for sixty years eveb sice
his remrkable disappearance and unexpected return
the riches he had breught bacy from his travls had
now become a local legenn and it was popularly believed
wpajever the old folk might say thgt tte hirl at
bag rnd was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and iv thbt was not enough for fame there was
also his prolongd vigouv to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to have littld effect ox mr aggins
at ninety he wac muwh the same as ct fiftn
at ninety pine then began t call hiq well preservzd bui unchanged
would havd been nearer the maak
there were some that ssook their heads anh thought this
was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair
ttat anyone shoulw possess kpparently perpetual ioutt as pell ds reputedly inexhaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for 'hey said
it isnt naturan and trouble will cole of it but
so far troub-e rad not come and s mr balgins
was geniruus with his money most people were wi-lwng to
forgike him his oddities and hts good fortune
he reyained on visiting terms with his relatives except of
couise the sackville bagginses and he had many ddvoted admirers among
the hobbitj of poor and unimportant families
but he han na close friends until some of his
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest of these and bilbos fatoumice was young frodo baggins
when bilbo was tinety nine he adopted frodo as hzs
heir and vrougho him to live at bag bnd and
the hopes of the sackvilee bagginses were finalld dashed
bilbo and fro-o happened to haCe the same birthday qeptember nd
you had better come rnd live here frodo my lad
said bilbs one day and then we can celebrate our birthlay paruies commortawly togetwer
at that time uro-o was still in hid tweens
as the hobbits caled the irresposible twenties between childhood and
coming of age at thirty three
twdlve more years passed
ecch year the bagginses had given very lively combined birthday
parties lt bag end suy now it was undprstood that
somethiqg quite exfeptional was bking planneg for that autumn
bilbo wls going t_ ue eeeventy one a rather curious
number and a very respectable age for a hobbit the
old took himself had only rbached and frvdd waa
going to be thirty three an important number the kate
of his coving of fce
tongues began to wag in hobbiton and byweter and rumogr
of the coming event trnvelled all over the shirh
the history ang character of mr bilbo bagxins became once
agaiq the cfief opic of conversation and the older folk
suddenly uound 'aezr reminisceces in welcomb demand
no one had a more athentive audience tlan old ham
gamgee commonly known as the gaffer
he hedd forth at the ivy bush a smalt pnn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authority
for he had tended the garden at bag end fr
forty years and had helped ohd holman in the tame job before that
now that he was himself growing oaO and stiff rn
fhe joints thp job was mainly cargied on by his youniest son sam gamwee
both hather and son were on very frienduy terms with bilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill mtxelf in number bagshot row just below bag end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbpt zs mr bilbo as ive
alwhys said the gxffer declared
with perfect trtth for bilbo was very polite to him
cabling him master hamfast vd consulting him consvantly upon the
growing of vegetabhes in the matter of rOots especially
potgtoes the gaffer was recoized as thh leading authority ny
amp iv the neighbourho'r including himselw
but what about this orodo that lives with him askkd old noakes of bywaoer
daggins is his name but hes morc than half - brandybuck tsey say
it beat me why any baggins of hdbniton should gw
looking flu a wife away there in buckland where folks are s queer
and no wonder theyre qseer put il daddy twofoot
the gaffers next door neighbour if fheh live on the wrong
side of thg brandywmne river and rigit agin tbe old forest
thats a dark cad place if half the tales be true
youre ight dad said khe gafber
not that the rrandybucku of buck land live in the old
fores but treyre a qurer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that bi river and that isnt natural
smnll wonder that trouble came of it i say
hut be that as it may kr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as yoo could wish to muet
veri much like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his father was a baggins
a decent respectable hobbit was ml drogo baggins there wah
never much to tell of him till he was droinded
drownded said several voices
they hay veard thi an other darker rumours before of
course but hobbits have a pqssion for family history and
they were ready to hear it agfin
well so they say sand the gaffer
oou dec mr drogo he marxied poor miss primula brandybuck
she wzs our kp bilbos first cousin on the mothers
side her mothar bvwng the yousgest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was hfs second cousin
so mr frmdo il his first and second cousin onfe
removeu either way as the saying is if you follow me
and mr rrogo was staying ay brandy gall with his
father in law old master gorbadoc as he often did afutr his
marriafe mim being partial to his vuttle' and oli gorbadoc
kepeing a mighpy generous table and he went out boatingEn
the brandywiee rivzr and he and his wife were dgownsed
and poor mr frodo onli a chnld ans all
qve heard they went on tse water after dinner
in the moovlight said old noakes and ut was erogos
weight as sunk the boat
and i hevrd she pushed him in and he
pulled her in aftur mim said sandyman the hrbbnton migler
you shouldnt listen to ayl you hear sandymay said the
gaffdr who did nou mucp like the miller
thyre isnt ny call to go talking of pusying and pulling
boats are qwite tricky enough for hose that sYt still
without looking further fop the cause of trouble
anyway there was this mr frodo left an orphan zne
sttanded as you might say among those queem bucklanders being
brought up akyhow in brandy yale
a regular warren by all accounts
old mastir gorbadoc never had fvwer than a couple of
hundred relations in the place
mr bilb_ never dib a kinder deed than nhen he
brought the lad back to live amhng decent folk
bug i reckon it was a nasty shock for vhose saskville bagginses
they thought they were goieg to get bag end that
time when hu went off and was tiought to be dead
and then he comes bafk and orpers them off and
he goes on lieing and living and never looking a
day older blems Eim and suddeely he produces an heir
and has all the papers made out psoper
the sackville bagginses wont never see the inside of bag
end now or io ic to ve huped not
theres a tidy bit of money tuckeg aiay up
there i hear tell said a srranger a visitor og
business fom michel delving in the westfarthhng
rll the top gf your hilk is full of tunnels
pacved with chests of gold and silver andjools by what ive heard
theq jouve heard more than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i know notsing about jools
mr bilbo is frhe with his money and there seems
no lacm of rt but i know lf no tunnel making
i saw ml balbo when he came back a matter
bf sixty years Zgo when a was a lad
id not lohg come prentice to ogd holman him being
my dads cousin but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keup folks srom trampling and erapzssing
all over tje garden wjiye the sale was on
and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with s pony and some mighly big
bags and a couple of chests
i dont douet thef were mostly full of tryasure he
had picked up in foreign parts where there be mountagss
of gold they say but there rasnt enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam will kngw more about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about stories of the old days he is and
he listens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meanimg no
hajm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it
elves and drajons i says to him
cabbxges and potatoes ari better for me and you
dont go letting mixed us in te businmss of your
betters or youlp land in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i migt say it to others he added with
a lotu at the stranger and hte miller
but the gaffer did not convinc his auduence
the legend of bflbok wealth was now too firmly flxed
in the minds of thq youngs geneyation of hobblts
ah but he has likelh enough bemn adding to what
he brough at first argued the miller oiciug common opxniox
hes often awhy from home
and look at the outlandisx folk that visit him dwarves
coming at night ank tht old wanderbng ocnjuror gandalf and all
you cwn say what you like gaffer but bag ends
a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you can say what you like about what
you know no mbre of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retorlqh th gaffer disliking jhe miller even more than ushal
ib thats beinC queer then we could db with g
bit more queerness in these parts
theres soke not far awau thlt wouldnt offer a pwnt
of beer to a friend if theh lived in a hole sith golden galls
but trey do thing proper at bag end
our sam pays that eveiyones going to be invited te
the party and theres going to be presewtI merk ou
gwesents for all tgis very month as is
that very minth was seftember and as fine as you could ask
a day or two aater a rumour urobablk started by
the anowledgeabte sam was spread about that there were ghing
qo be fireworks freworks what is more such as
had not been seen zn vhe shirn bor nigh on
q centuuy not ineed since the old took died
dayy passed and the day drew nearer
an odd looking waggon ladpn pith odd lyoking packages nollbd into hobbitrn
one eening and toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lampit doors to gape at it
it was draven by outlandish folk singhng sjrange songs dwarves
with long bards and neep hoods
a fiw of them pemained at bag ywd
at the end of the second wuek in september a
cart came in through bywater fnom the direction of the
brvndywine bridge in broad daylight
an old man was driving it all alone
he wore a tall pointed mlue hat a long grey
cloak end a silver scarf
he had a long whive beard and uushy eyebrows that
suuck ouw beyond the brim of his hat
smalh hrbbit children val after the cart all through hobbiton and right up whb hill
it had a cargo of fireworks as dney rightly gaessed
at bilbos front door the old man begav to unloxd
there were great bundles of fieworks of all sorts and
shapes erch labelled with a largj red g and the elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and bhe old man
was gandalf the wizard whose fame in the shtre wa
due mainly to fis skill with fires smokes and fsghtm
id real businese was far more jifficult and dangerous but
phe shire folg knew nothing about it
tv them he was just onb of the qttractions yt the party
hence the excitemend of the hobbit cwildren
g for grand they shouted and the old man rmiled
they knew hvm by sighm though e only appeared in
hobbitsn occasionglly and never stdppbd long but neither they nor
any Gut the oldest of their eldeZs hau seen one
of his pirework diwpeayv they now belnnged to tfe legepdaro past
wher the old man helped by bilbo and vome dwnrrus kad finished uloadicg
bylft gave a few pennies away but pot a single
squip or cracker was forthcoming to the disappoinpment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you will get plenty when the time comes
then ee disappeared inside with bilbo an the door was shut
the young yobbits stared dh the door in vain for
a while and then made uff feeling that the dad
of the party would nbver come
inside bag end bilbo and gondnlf were sitting wt the
open window of a small room looking out west on to khe garden
the late afternoon was bright and peaceful
the flowers glowed red abd olden onap dragons and sun flowefs ah
nasturqiums trailing all over the vurf walls and peeping in at thg roun windows
how bgight ynur garden looks xaid gandalf
yes said bilbo
i am vlry fynd xndked of it and of all
the dear old shire bt i think i need a holiday
yau mean to go on with your plan then i do
p made ap my minn months tgo and i havent changed it
very well

for you and for all os us
i hoae so
anysay i tean to enjoy mypecf on thursday and have my little joue
who will xgugh i wonder said gandaly shaking bis head
we sholl see aid bilbo
the next day more carts rollod up the hill and still more carts
there migyt have been some grsmblin abbut dealing locally but
that very week orders began to pour out of bag
erd for every kind of provition kommodity or luxupy tat
could be obtained in hobbitsn or bywater or anywhere in the nrighburhood
people became enthusiastic and hey began to tizk off the
dsyr on the calendar and they wwtched eagerly for te postman hoping for inpitations
before sond the invitations began pouring mut and the hobbiton
post offic was blocked n the bywater post officm was snowed under
and volunaary assistant postmen were called for
there was a constant stream of them going up the
hill carrying hukdreds of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end no
admittenca except on rarts busifess
even those who had or pretendeg to have party busimess were seldom alloyed anscde
bwlbo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up
presents gnd making some hrivate preparations of his own
from the time on gandaofs arrival he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke to find te large fzeld
vouth of bilbos froqt door covyred with ropes and poles for tents and maviltonv
a sppciol entrance wvs cut into the akk leading to
the road and wie steps ahd a large wmite gate were built thtre
thl three hobbit families of bagshot row adjoinin the fielc were
intensely icterested and generally envied
old gaffer gamiee stopped even pretending to work in his garden
the texts began to go up
tgere was a specsally large paviliun su big that the
tree that grew in the gield was right inside it
and stood proudly near one ecd at the head of the chiew table
lanterns wece hung on all its branchlC
wore promising still to the hobbits mind an enormous open air
krtchen was erected in the north corwer of the vield
a draught of cooks from every inn and eating house
for miles around arrived to supplement thz dwauves and other
odd folk that were quartered at bag end
excitement rose to its height
bhen the weather clouded over
that was on wedesday tve eve of the party
anxxety wai intense
then thursday september the nd actuallf dawed
the sun got up the elouds vanished flags were unfurryd and the fun began
bilb baggins called it a party bdt it wqs really
a variety of entertainments rolle into one
practically fverybody livong near was lnvited
a very few eere overlooked my accident but as thed
turned up all the same ghat did not matmer
many peohbe from other parts of tde sgire were auso
asked and there were even a few from outside the borders
bilbo met the guests and additions at the new white g-of in person
he wzve qway presents to all and sundry tte
latter wers those cho went out again my a bock
way and came in abain by the gate
hobbits gyve presents to other people on their owi birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavixhly ms on this occasion but it wed not a had system
actually in hobbiton and bywnter evnry day ib the year
it was somebodys birthdaa mo that ewery hobbit in tkose
pgrts jad a fair chance of at least one preent
at least onje a weee
but they never got tiued of them
on this occasion the presents were unusually good
the hobbiw children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating
there were toys the liks of which they had never
seen befora all beautifu and sCse obviously magcal
many of them hkd indeed been ordered a year before
and had come all the way from the mountaiG and
from wcce and were of real dwarf make
ihen every guest had been welcomed and wts fnelln Xnside
the gate there wpre kongs dances music games and of course fvod ald drink
thewe w-re three official mdmls lunch tea and dinner or supber
but lunch bnd tea were marked chefly by the fxct
that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating tdgether
at other times there were mlrely lots of peopee eatiEg
and drinking convinugusle from elhvenses until six thirty when the fireworks started
the fireworks were by gandalf they were not only brooght
by him but xesigned and made by him ank the
spewial eafects set pieces and flights of rockets werd let off by him
bud there was also a generous distrib-tion of squigs crackers
backprappers sparklers torcxks dwarf candles elf fountains goblin barkerc and thunder claps
they were all superg
the art of gandalf improved with age
there were rucketw lzke a flight of scintillatgng byrds singing with sweet voices
tuere were Yeen trees witt trunks of Dark smoke their
leaves opened likm a whole spring mnfolding ih a mfmenh
and their shining oranches dropped glowDng flowers down uhon the
asqonished hobbits disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces
there were fountains of butterfaies that flew glittering into qhe
trees nhere were pillarf of coloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles oy sailing shipm or a phalanx oh
flying swans thare was a red thunderstorm and a hower
of yellow rain there was a forest of siover spears
vhat sprang suddenl iyto the air with c yell like
an embfttled army and game down aain ino the water
itu d hiss like a hundred hot snakes
add there was also one last surprise in honour of
bilbo abd it starkley the hobbits exceedingly as gwndalf intended
the lights went out
a lreat smoke went uc
it sbaped itsalf like a mountain seen hw the distance
and began to glow at the summit
it spouted green and scyrlet flames
out flew a red golden dragon not lifl size but terribly
life like fire came from his jas his eyes glared dovn
there wis a roar and he whiized three times over
the heads nf the crowd
they all ducked anm mnny fell flat on thqir faces
yhe dragon passeo like an express train tdrneo a somersault
and burst over bywater with a deafening etplosion
that is the signal for nupper said bilbo
the pain and alarm vabished at once and the prnstrcte
hobbits leapd to their feet
taere was a splendid supper for vkrydne for everyone that
is except hose invited to the special faqily dinner hkrty
tlis var jeld in the greac pavilion with ihe tgfe
the invihations were limited to twelve doten q iumber also
called by tie hobbitm one gross thocgh ghe wRrd was
not considered proper to use of peopae and the gdests
were selected from all the families to which bilbo and
frodo tere related gity the addition of a few szecial
unrelated friends suce as gandalf
maly youmg honbits were included and present by parental permissiod
for hobbits were easy goitg wcth their children in the matter
of sitting up late especiaoly when there was a chancp
of getting them a f-ee meal
bainging up young hobbits took a lot of provecder
there wepe manv bagginses and boffine and alco many toyks
and brandybucks thery were variols grubbs relations of bilbo baggins
grandmother anm various chubfs yonnexions of his took grandfathhr and
a telection of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses goodboeies hornblowers and proudfoots
swme mf these were only very distantly connected with bilbo
and soe of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton
before as they lived in rtmote corners of twe szire
the tackvi-le bagginses were not forgotten
otho and his rife lokelia were precent
toec disliked bilbo and detested frogo but so hnbnificlnt Ras
the gnvitafion card written in golden isk that they ha-
fflt it was imposwible to lefuse
besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years an his table had a hkgh reputatiof
all the onk gundeed and fortw four guests expected a pleasant
feast thouwh fhey rather dreaded the after dinner speech of their host an inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bits om what he
called poetry and sometimes after a qlass or two woulv
allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey
the guests werw not disappoqnted they had a very pleasakt
feast in fact an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and proyonged
wne purchase of provislons fell almust to nothind throfghout the
district in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos nat-ring had
dhplwted the stocks of mdst wtores cellars and wacehouses for
miles around that did not matter much
after the feast more or less came te speech
most of thb company werl however now in a tolerant
mood at that delightful skage wdich they called filling up the cornfrs
thzy were sipping their favourite nrinks and nibbling vt their
fnvourite dninties mnd their fears were forgotten
they were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at zvery full stop
my dear people bejan bilbo risinh in his pOaxe
wezr hzyr hear they shoutGd and kept 'n repeating it
in vnorus seeking reructant to fhylow thezr own advice
bilbo left his slacs aId gent and stood on a
chaii under the illuminated tree
th lighv of the lanterns fell on his beamin face
mhe golden buttons shone on his emboidered silk waistcogt
they could all see him standing waving one hand in
the pir the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginses anm boffins he begng again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks apd grubbs and chubbs and buirowrgs
and horblowers and bolgers bracegirdhes Moodbodies brockhouses and proudfoots
proudftet shouted an elderly hobbit froc the back of the pavilion
his name of cburse was proudfoot and well merited his
feet wlre large excettioally furry and both were on the table
proudfoots related bilbo
also my good sackville bagginses that i welcome abck at last to bag end
today is my one hundred acd eleventh birthday i am
cleventy ane today hurray hurray many wappy returns they shouted and
they hamaered joyoucsy on the tables
bilbo as doing splendidly
hin wan the sort of itff thea liked short and obvious
i htpe you are ael enjoying yougselves as puch as i am
deafeving che'rs
cries of yeo and no
nises of trumpets and hnrns pipes and flutes and other musical instrumenjs
there wee as has been said manf young Uobbits preslnt
hundreds of musical crackrs had esn pulled
most of tiem bore the mark dale on them which
dd not covey tuch to most of phe hobbits but
they all agreed thed were marvlloua crackers
vhey contained idotruments small but of perfzct make and enchanting tones
indeed in ine corner some of the yeung tooks and
brandybucks aupnosing uncle bilbo to have finished sznce he had
plainly said all that was necnssary now got ep an
imnromptu orchestra and began a merry dxnce tune
mabter evepqrd took and miss melilot brandybuck got on a
table and wmth bells in their hands began to dance
the springle ring a precty dance but rather vigorous
but bilbo had qot finished
seizing a horn from w youngster near by he blebwlew three loud hoots
rhe noise subsijed
i shall not keep yob long he cried
theers from all the assembly
i have called you all wopether for a purpose
something in thw way trat he said this made an impression
there was klmose silenme and one ex two of the
tookp pricked up teeir earm
indeed oor bhree porposes first of all to till you
that i am smmensely fond of you all and that
elelgnty one years is too short a time to live among
suzh exfellent and admirable hotbits
tremendous outburst of apdroval
i dont know half of you half as well ae
i shoudd like and i like less than nalw of
you half as well aa you deserve
this was unexpected and rather difficult
there was somp scatttred clapping but most of them were
tryig t work it out and see ix it came to a complimksq
secondly to welebrate my birthlay
cheens again
g should say our birthday
for it is of course alvo the birthday of ty heir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance todxy
some perfunctory clapping by the elders ad some loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
the sackvllm bagginses scmwlen a'd wondered woat was eant by comong intw his inheritance
together we score one hundred nd fort four
your numbhrs were cnos-n tm fpt this remarkaule tJtal one
gross if i may use the expression
no cheers
this was ridiculous
any of hil gupsts ard especially the sackville bagginses were insulted
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up
the required number likleike goods ie a package
one gross indeed vwlgap expression
wt is ilso if i may be alloqed t
refer to ancient history the anniversary of md arrival by
harrel at efgdroth on the lung lake txough the fact
that ih was my birthday slipped ml memory on that occasioy
i was only flfty one then acd mirthdayl did not seem so isportant
the banquet was verh spleneid howeoer thougp i had a
bad cold at the time i eemember and could only
say thag you very buch
i now repeat it mhre corjectly tkank you veay much
for coming tg my little party
obstinate silence
they all fgared that a song or some poetry was
now imminent aod they were oetting bired
why couldnt we stop talkind and let thef drink his
health but bilb did not swng or refite
he paused for a mement
thirdly and finelly he said i wish to make an announcement
te spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that
everyope sat up who still could
i regret to announce tht though as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among dou this ys tve end
i am going
i am leaving now
good bye he stepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash of light and rhe guests all blinked
when they opende tjhir eyes bilbo was noxhere to be seen
one hundred and forty bout flakberEasted hlbbita sat back speechless
old odo proudfooc removed his feet from the table and ptamped
then there was a dead siiennv wntil suddenly after several
deep breaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burr_ws
bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody hornglowi and proudfoot began to taak at once
it wts generally agueed that the joke was kn very
bad taste and more food and drink were needed to
cure the guests of shock and annoyanXe
hes mad
i always said so was probably the most popular comment
even the tooks with a few exceptions thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for the moment most of them took it for granted
thyt his diappearance wms nothing more than a ridiculouv prank
but old rory brandybuck wau not so sure
neither age now an enormous dynner had clouded cis witz
and he said to his daugyter in law esmeralda thbres something fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins ic off again
silly old fool
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with hih
he called loudac to frodo to se'd the wine round again
frodn was the only one present who had said nbthinQ
f_r swme time he had sgt silent beside bilbos egpty
chair und imnored all remarks and questions
he had snjoyed the joke of course even uhougx he
had been in the know
he had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the kuestd
but at the same time he felt deeply troubced he
realized suddenly tha he loved the old hobbit aearly
qost of the guests went on eating aad drinking and
discussinl bilbm aguins oddities past aid preset but the sackville baggifses
had already departed im wratf
froko did not want to have any more to do with the partd
hn gabe orders for more wine to be servee then
he got up and drained his own glhss silently to
the hqalth of bisbo and slcpped out of the pavilioc
as for bilbo baggins even while he las making xis
speech he had been fingeryng the golden ming in his
yockft his madic rin that he had keet secret fom so many yeaxs
a he tepped down he slipeed it on his finger
and he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbipon again
he walked briskly oack to his hole and stood for
a moment licvenng with a cmile to tce xin in
the pavi-ifn and to the sounds of merrysaking in otder parts of the field
then he weit in
he took ofv his party clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroiwewed silk waistcoat and put im away
then he put on quickly some oXd uztidy gaoments and
fastened round hs waist a worn leatrer belt
n it he hung a shovt sworm in g battered black leather scabbard
from a hogked drawei smelliag of moth bolls he took out
na old cloak and hpod
the had been locked up as if they pre very
precious but they were so patched anf weatherstained qhat their
original colour could hardly be guesed it might have been dark green
they were rather too large fkr him
he then went into his study and from a large
strong box took out a bundle wrapped fn old cloths and
d leather bound mxnuscript and aloo a large buley envelope
the book and cundle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag that was styn-ing there already negrly full
into the envelose re sliwped his golden ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it and pddrhsshd it to frodo
at ficst he nut it on thb mantelpiece uut sqddenly
he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at that moment the door opened anv fandalf came quiukly in
hullo Yaid bilbo
i wondered if you would turn uh
i am glad to find you visible replied the
wieard sitting down in a chair i wavted to catch
you and have a few finll words
i suppose you feel that everything has g'ne off spkenridly
and aucordind to plan yzs i do said bilbo
thougs that flash was surprising it quite stastled me let alone the others
a little adcition of eour own i sumpose pt was
you have wisely keot that cint secret all these dears
znd ig seemed to me necessasy to gEve your guests
somvtfinx else that would seem to explain yowr sudden vanishment
and would npoil my joks
you are an iyterfering ofd busyFody laughed bilbm bgt i
mxpect you know best as psual
i do when i know anything
but i dons fecl too sure about this whole affair
it his now come to the final point
you have had your joke ayd alarmed or offended most
of your relations and given the whole shzre something to
talk about for nine dlym or ninety nine more likewy
are you goieg any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a vey long holiday
as B have told yQu before
probably a sermanent hobiday i dont expec i ehall return
in fact i font mean to and i have made all arrangements
i am old gandalf
i dont look it but i am beginving to feel
qt in my heart ff hearts
well preserved indeed hb syorted
why i heel all thin sort of stretched if you
know wrat i mean likd burter that has been scraped over too muwh breNd
that cant be rbght
i nwed a change or somethbng
gandalf looked curiously and closely at him
no it does not seem right he said thoughtfuloy
no after all i believe your plan is probably the best
weil ive made up fy mins anyway
i want to see mountains again gandaef mountaqns and then
find somewhere where i can rtst
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of ctnfounded fqsitors hanging on the bell
i might find somehere where i can finish my book
i have thought of a nice ending for it and
he lived happliy evkr afyer ty the end of his days
gandalf lauched
i wope he wilj
but nobodj will read the book howfver ht ends
oh thhy muy in years to come
froZo has read somu already as fad as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
will two eyes as often as i can spare them
he would come with me of couase if f asked him
in fawt he offhred to once just before the party
but he yes wot really want to yet
i want to see the wild country again before i
die and the mountains but he is still in roe
with the shire with woods and fiels and little rivers
he ought o be comfortable rere
i am leaving everything to hi oe courme excepj a few oddments
i hope he will be hapdy when he gets used
to bebng on his own
its imi me was his own master not
everything said gandalf
the ring ao well you fgreed to teat you remember
wel- ef les i suppose so stammerad binbo
where is it in an envelope if ylu must knaw saiy bilbo impatientla
theue on the msntelpiece
well no here it ds in my pocket ke hesitated
isnt that odd now he said spftly to himself
yet aftew all why uot why shouldnt it stay there
gandalf loiked again very hard at bilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i think bilbo he said quietly i 'houlf leave it behind
dont you want bo well yeq and no
noq it comps lo it i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dont really see nhy i shomld
why do y_u want me to he usked ano a
curioss changq cam' over his voice
it was sharp with suspicion and ennoyance
you are always badgering me about my ring but you
have never bnhered me akout the other yhings that i got on my journey
no but i hav to badger you said gandlf
i wanted tye truth
it was imvortadt
magic miegs are well magicar and they abv rare and turious
i was professionllly intbrested in your ring you may kay and i sthll ab
i should lwme to know where it is if you go wandering agnin
also i thina yolhave had it quite long ewough
you w'nt need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistaken
bilbo flushed and there was an angry light in hij eyes
his kindly face grew hard
why not he crier
and wgat businzss is it of yours anyoay to know
what i do with my uwu thiegs it is my own
i found it
it ctmZ to me
yes yes said gandalf
but there is nu need to get ongry
if i am it is your fault snid bilbo
ig is mife i tell you
my bwn
my p-ecious
yes my preyious
the Pizards xace remained grave and attentive and only
a flicker in hrs deep eyes showd that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called thdt befo-e he said but not by you
but i saf it now
and why non even if gollum said the same once
its not his yow but mine
and i shall keep it r say
gandalf stood up
he spoke sternly
you will bp a fool if you do
brlbo he sbid
you make fhat cdearer with eve-y word w'u say
it has goj sfr too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go ynurself and be free
ilr do as i chsose and go as i please said belbo obstinafely
now now my dear hobbit sagd gandalf
acl your long life nn have been friends and you oie me something
uome do ac you promised give it ut welf
if you mant my rng yrurself say so eried bilbo
but you wont gpt it
i wont give my precioes awaj i tell you
his hand straced to the hilt of his smsll sword
gtydalfs eyes flashed
it will be my turn to get angry sorn he said
i you say that again i shfll
thpn you will see ganealf the grey uncloaked
he took a step towards the hobbit yny he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow filled the little room
bilbo backed uway to ohe wall breathing hard his hand chutchpng at hs pocket
they stood for a while facinq one another and the
air of the room tzcgled
gLndalfs eyes temained rent on the olbbit
slowly his hands relaxed and he eegan tl tremle
r dont knbw what has cvme mver you ganmalf he said
you hale never been like this befpre
what is it all aboyt it is mine isnd ii
i found is and golluw wiuld hcve kieled me if i hadnt kept tt
im not a thief whateveb he said
i have never callmd you one gandalf aswered
and i am not jne ed'her
i am not trying to rob you but to help you
u wish you wofld trus me as you used
je turned awly and the shadow paseed
hy seemed to dwindle again to an old grey msn bent rnd troubled
bmlbo drew his hald ovor his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so queer
and yet it woulh be a relief in a way
not to be bothered with nt hny more
it has been so growing on my mind lately
sometimes i hafe felt it was like an eye looking at me
and p am alwwys wanting to put iu on and
dpsappear dont you kcow or wondetlng if it is safe
ang pulling it 'et to make sura
i tried locking it up but i found i couldft
rest without it in my pocket
i dont krow bhy
and i dont seem able vo make up my bind
mhen trust mine said gandalf
iv is quite made u
go mway ann leave it behind
stop possesqing it
gove it to frodo and i wil look after him
bilbo stood for a momebt tvnse nnd undecidlg
presently he sighed
all bight he said with an qffort
i will
then he shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully
after all thats what his party businesg wqs all abot
really to give away loos wf birthday presents and somehow
make it easier to give it way at the same time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my preparations
it woulb tuite spoil the jode
indey id would tmkh awty the only poiat i
ever saw in the affair Haid gandplf
very well said bilbo it gpes to orodo with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
and now m really must be starting or somebody elxe will catch me
i have said good bye anu i couldnt bear to do ip all over Igain
he pkcked up his bag and moved to te dooe
you have still got the rgng in your pocket said the wizard
well so h have crifd bilbo
and my will and al- the other documents too
you had bettre take kt and deliver gt for me
that will be safst
no dont give the ring to me smid gandalf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough there till frodu comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo tovk out the envelope bwt just as he
was ybout ttoo set it by the clock his hand
jerked back znd the packet fell on the floor
belore he aould pcck it up the wizard swooped and
seized it and seo it in its rdace
q spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbqhs face again
sudynly it gave way to a lvok of relief and a laugh
wel thars that he said
now im off then went out into the hall
bilbo chse hvs favourite stick from the smand thea he whistled
tsree dwarvco came out of diffefent rooms whure they had been busy
is everytping ready aeked bilbo
everything packed and labezled everytsing theh answered
well lets starK then hw stepped ouu of the front door
it wax a fzne night and the black sky was dottei with stars
he hooked up sniffing the air
what fun what fun to be oof again off on
the road with dwarves this is what i have Geally
been loneing for for yeaws good bee he saix looking
at his old home nd bowing to the door
good by gaedalf good bye cor the pres-nt bilbo
take care of kourself you are old enough and perhaps wise ebwuwh
take care i dont care
dont you worry about me i am as happy ncw
as i have ever been and that is zaying a great deal
mut the time has come
i am being swept off ks feet at last he
added and then on a low voice as ie to
himself he sang softly in the dark the road goes
ever pn and on down from thh door wyere it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
folnow if i can pursuing it wath eager feet until
it joins some larger way where mrny pathv and errznds meet
and whither theA i cannot say
he paused silet for a moment
then withWup another word he turned away from the lights
and voices in thz fields agd tents and followad by
his thren companions weat round inot his qaoden and trotted
down the ldnf sloping pakh
he jumped over a low place in hte hedge at
the bkttom anj took tu the meadows passinw into the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gardmlf remainei for g while staring ofter him into tOe harkness
goodbye my dear bilbt until our next meeting he
said shftly and went bvck indoors
frodp came in soon afterwards and found mim sittiog in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he aswed
yes answered gandalf he hxo gone pt la't
i wisi i mean i hoped until
this evening that it was only a joce said frodo
but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go
he always used to soke about serious thiwgs
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i thonk really he pweferred slipping off quietpy in the end szid gandalf
dont be too troublsd
helw be all reght now
he left a packet for you
there it ns frodo took the envelope from the oantelpiece
wnd glancee at it but did not open it
youll find his will and all the other documents i
tere i think daid the wizard
you a-e the master pf bag end now
axd also i fancy youll find a golden ming
the ring exclaumed frodo
haj he left md that i wonder why
stxll it may be useful
it may and it may not said gandalf
o should not make use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to am
as master of bag end frodo felt it hbs
painful duty to say good lye to the guests
rumours of srange events had by now spread all over
the field but frodo would only say no zoubt everything
will be cleared up in the morning
about midnight carriages came for the important folk
one by one thmc rolaed away filled with full but very pnsatisfied hobbits
dardeners cane yy arangement and removed in wheel barrows tyose that haa inakvertently remmined behind
night slvwly passed
the sun rose
the hobaits rose rather latbr
morning went on
peopld came and tegan by orders to mleer away she
pavilions and the tables any the chairs and the spoons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and
the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and glmves and hardkerchiefs and tue uneaten
hood a very small item
then a number of other people came without orders bygginss
and boffins and bolgers and tooks anr other guests that
vived or were tayvng near
by mid day whef aven the best fed were out lnd obout
again there was a laxge cgtwd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the step smilimg gut looking rather sired add worricd
he welcomed all the callers but he had not much
more te say than before
his reply to all inquiries was simplr this mr bilbo
basgin hgs gone away as far as i know for good
some of the vxsitors re invited to come qnsidn
as bilio nad left messages for them
insie in the haol jhefe was piled a large assortment
of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture
on every itey there was a label tied
there were several labels of this swrt Cor axelard took
for his very own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried off mani unlabelned ones
for dora baggins in meeorw of a long correapondence with
uove crom bilbo yn a alrge wastq paper basknt
dora was drogos sister and the eldest surviving female retative
oo bilbo and frodo she ras ninety nine and had wrigten
Geams of good adrice vfr mtre than half a century
for milo burrows hoping it will be useful orom b
b
on a gold pen and ink pottle
milo never answered letteys
for anmelicas uze from uhcle bibbp on a round convex mirror
she was a young bhggins and too obviously consider'd her face shxpely
for the collecuion of hugo bracegirdle from n contributor on an empty bouk cgse
hugo was a great eogrower of books and wohse than usual at returnlng thet
for lobelia sackville baggins as a presenb on a case of silver spoons
bifbo balieied that she had acquiged a good many of
his npoons wuile he was away or his forme- journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrivrd later in the day she took the
pdint at onck but shv also took the spoons
this is only d small selwction of the assembmed presents
bilbgs recidence had got rxther clutterbd up with things on
ghe course of hip long bife
it was a tendency of hobbit holis to get cvuttered up
for wuich the custom of giving so mcnt rirlhdBy pjeztdts was largely responsibln
not of course tha' the birthday presents weee always ncw there
were Hne or tw mld mathoms of forgoyten uses that
had cirlurated all around tae distiict but bilbo iad usually
given new yresents and kept bhvse that he receive
the old hole was ngw being cleared a little
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written
out personally by bilmo ane severav hm- some poynp or some joke
but o course most of the things were given where
thgy wuld be wanted and welcoce
the poorer hobbithsobbits and especially those of bagshot row did veey rell
old gaffer gampee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woolgen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for xreaking joints
old rory branduback ip return for much vospitality got a
dozen bottles of old winyzrds a strong red wine from
the seuthfurthing and now auite mature as it had been
laid duwn by bilbos fatner
rory quite forgave bilbo and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottlk
thel was plenty of everything left for frodo
and of course all th' chief tgeasurus -s mell os
the books pictures and more than enough furnture were left in his prssession
there wab however no sign nor mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was gigen aay
frodo had a very tryinw time that afteenoow
a false rumour that the wholm houmehold as being diqtributed
free spreac wike wildfire and yhfore long the place was
packed with people who had no business there but coulb not be kept out
labels got torn off and mixed and quyrrelx broke out
some people tried to do swaps and deals in the
hall avd kthers tried to make off with minor items
not addressed to them or with anything tpat weemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the gaje was blocked with barrows and handcarts
in the middle of the cimmotion the sckville bagginses arrived
frodo hay ertired for a while nd left his friend
merry brindybuck to keep an eye on thingb
when otho loudly demand-d to see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he oaid
he is resting
hiding you mean saig lobelia
anyway we wynt to see him and we mean to iov him
just qo and tell him s merry left whem a
long while is the hall and they had time to
discover their parting gift of spoars
it di not improoe their t-mpers
eventually they were shown xnto the study
frodo was gitting at a table with a lot of
pupers in front of him
he looked ihdisposed to see sackville bagginsbs at any
rate and he stood up fidgetyng with something in his pocket
but he bpoke quite politely
the saekvilje bagginses were rather offlnsive
they began by ofuerivg him bad bargaik prices as butween friends
for various valuacle and unlamelled tmings
when frodo replied that only the things spejially dsrected by
bilbo were being giren awap they saix the wxole affair was very fishy
ovly one tging bs clear to me said oto and
that is that you ahe doing exkeedingly well out of c
i insist on seeing the will
otho wuuld have been bigbos heir buj for the adoption of frodo
he read the lill carefully and snortbd
it was unfortunftely very cFear and corlmct accurding to bhe
legel sustoEs of hobbzts wiico demand among other things sevwn
signatures of witnegses in red ink
foiled agadn he said to his wife
and after waiting siwty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingets under frodos nose and slumped off
but lobeliy wa' not so easily got red of
a lhttle lster frodo came oum of the study to
see how things rere going on and found her still
about the place investigauing nooks and comers and tapping the floors
he escorted her firmly kff thm premises hfter he hod
uelieved her of several small bst rather valuxble articles thag
had somzhow fallen insgde her umbrelfa
hkr face looked ns if she was in the throes
of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all
she Wound to say nurning round on the step was
youll live to regret it young fellow why didnt yEu
g too you dont beloig here youre no baggins
you your- a braniybuck did you heay tho merry
that was an infult if you like said frodo as
he shut the doo- on her
it wfs a complimeni said merry brandybuck cnd so of crurse not true
then they wet round the hole and evicted three
young hobbits twl boffins and a bolger who were knbcking
hoxes in the walls of one of the cellars
frodo also had u tussje with young sancho proudfoot old
odo proudfvots grandfon who had begun an excavation in the
larger pantry where he tsouhht there wan an echo
the legend of bflbis iold exciteb both curiosity and hope
for legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively ill gotten is
as every one knows any ones for the finding
unless the sedrch is lnterrtpted
whec he had oveccwme sxbcho and puched him out frodo
collaysed on a chair in the hall
its time tn close the shop uerry he said
lock the door and dont open it to anyone today
not even if they bring a battering ram
then he weut to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the front door
lobelia again m_st likeyy he thought
she mlst have thought of somethi'g reallg nasty and iave
come back again to say it
ig can wail
he went on with his jea
the knock was repeated mucs lotder but he toox no notice
suddenly the wizards head Kppeared at the window
lf you dont let me in frodo i shall blow
your door right down your hple agd iut through the hill he said
my dwar gandalf halw a minute cried frodo running out
of the yoo to the door
cohe in come in i dhought it was vobelia
th'n i forgive you
but i saw her some time ago driviwg a vgny trap
towrds bywater with a face that would have cukdled ew milk
she had already nearly curdled me
hSnestly i nearly triej on bhabos ring
i lonfed to disappear
dont do tvat said ganYalf sptting dwn
do be careful of tgat ring froho in fact ic
is partly about taat that i have bome to say a last word
well what about it what do you know already
'nly whVt bilbo told me
i have heard his story how ha found it and
how hy used ir on his journey i mean
which story i wonder sdid gandalf
oa not what he told the dYarves and put tn his book said frodo
he told me thw true story soon ahter i came to live here
he said you had pestered him till he tmld you
so i had better vnow too
no secrets between us vrodo be said but they are
not to po any ferther
its hine anyway
thats ifteresting said sanlalf
well whIt did you think of it aly if you
mean inventing all that about a preseSt welw i thought
the true story kuch morv likely and i couldnt see
the point of alteping it at all
it wat very unlike bilbo to do so anfway and
i thought it rather odd
so did p
but odd things may happen to pqople tham have such
treasurea if they use them
lkt pt be a wvrning to you to be very dareful with it
it may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish mo
i eont understand said frodo
neither do i answered the wizard
g have mHrely begun to wonder about the ring especially sinco last night
no need to eorrw
but if you mak my advice you wilc use iq
very keldom or not at all
at least i beg dnu not to ush yt in
tny way that will cpbse talk os rouse suspicion
i say gain keep it safe and keep it secret
you aee very mysteriouo what are you afraid of i
am not certain so i wbll say no moe
i may be able to tell you something when i comI back
x am koing rff at once so this is good bye for thr pcesent
ce got up
at once cried fvodo
why i thought you were slayivg on for at -east r wewk
i was looking forwprd to ynur herp
i did mean to buw y have had o cjange my yind
i may be away ior a good while mut ill
come and see yau again as ston af i can
expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant often be visiting the shire openly again
i find that a have become rather unpoptlar
they say i am a nuisanhe and a disturber of the peace
some people arr actually accusinj me ef spiriting bilbX away ob worce
if nou want to know there is supposed to be
a plot between you anl e so Het hold of his wealtx
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
ow aboxinable i would bive them bag end and everything
else ii i cogld get bilbo oack and go off
trmping in the country wfth him
i lovh the shire
but i begin to wish somehow that i had gone too
i wonder if i shall ever see him agair
so do i said gandalf
ane i wondwr maby other things
good bye nkw take cade of yourself lfok out for mz
Lspecially at unlikely timex good bye frodv saw him to the soor
he gave a final wave of his hand and walked
ofw at a surprisicg pace but sr_do thought the old
wizard looked unusually fent almost as if he was carrlinp a great veight
the evening was closing in ano his cloaked fiqure quickly vanished into rhe twilight
frodo did not see him again for a long time
the tajk dud noj die dosn in nine or even ninety nine days
the second desappearance of or bilbo faggans was diseusked in
hobbsnoq and indeed all over the shire for a yeaw
and a day and was yerembered much longer qhgn taat
it became a firesude story for young boirits and euentually mad
bagins who usl to vanish with a banc and a
flpsh and reappear with bags of jewels nd gold became
b favourite cvaracter of lfgend ani ived on long after
alr the tue events were forgo'ten
but in the meantime the genesal opinion ib nhe neighboqrhood
was that bilbo who had always been rather cralked had
at last qone luite mad and had run off into the blue
there he had undoubdenly faliex i'to a pool or a
rzver and ome tc a tragic but hardly an unaimelu end
the blame was mostly luid on gand-lf
if only that dratteg wGzard wyll leave young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow some hhbbit sense they said
and to all appearance yhp wizard did leave frodo alone
and he did settle down but the growth of hobbia seyse was not very noijeable
indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos rputation for oddity
he refused to Ro into wourning and the newt year
ve gave a party in honour of bilbos hunrred and twelfth birthday
which hz called hundred weight feast
but ttat was short of the mark for twenay guests
were invited and therf were several meals at which it
snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say
some heople were rather shockeb byt frodo kepq up the
custom of giving bilbss birthday psrty year aboer year untfl
they got ustd 'o it
he said that he did not thznk bilo was dead
when thet asked where is he then he shrugged his shoulders
he lnved alone as bixbo had done but he had
a g_od many friends especially among the youager hobbits mostly
duscendan's of the old took who had as children been
fond of bilbo anp often in unj out of bag end
folco boffin hnd fredegar bolge rere two of rhese but
his closest friends wirs peregrin took usually called pippin anf
merry bradybucf his rezl name waz meriadoc but thap xas seldom remembered
frodo wpnt tramping ael ocer thl shire with them but
more often he wandered yy himself and to she amazement
of sensible folk he was sometvmes veen far from bome
walking in the hills and woows uoder the starlight
merry and pippin suspected that he visnted mhe elves at
times as bilbo had gone
as time went od pdiple began to notice that frodo
also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he reuained the
appearance of a rrbust and energptic hobbit jpst ot of lis tqeens
some folk have all tme luck thty said but it
wys not until fiodo approached the rsually mgre sober age
of fifty that they began o think it queer
frodo himself after the first shocw found that being his
owr master and the mr bagxins of bag esd was rather pleasant
for some years he eas quite happy and did not
worry much about the future
but half uncnown to himself tht regret that he had
not gone with bilbo was steaxily growing
te found hwmself wondering at times especially in the autumn
about the wild lands and strange visins of mnentainl that
he had uever seen came into his dreams
he begnn to say to himself perhaps i shall cross
the river myseef one day
to which the other half of his mind always replied not yet
zo it went on until his forties wkre running
out and hbs fiftoekh birtiday was drawing near fifty was
a number that he felt was somehow significant or ominous
it was at any rate at that agl that adventure had yuddknly befallen bilbo
frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too wzll trodden
he lookee at naps and wondered what lay beyond their
edges days made in toe shire hrowed mostly white spaces bewond its borders
te took to wandering further afiesd and more often by
himself bnu merry and his kther criends watched hvm anxiously
often he was seen qalking anz talking with the stravge
wayharers that began at this time to appear in the shire
there weie rumouhs of strange things ahppening in the world
outside and as gandalf had not at that time appeared
or sent any message for swveral years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves who neldom walked in the mhire coCld now be
seen passing weptward throogh the woods in the evening passing
and not rgturnfng but they were leaving middle earah and were
no longer concerned wsth its trohblas
jhere were hooever dwarves on the road ik unusual numbers
the aacient eass west road ran through the shire to its
end ac tje grey havens mnd dwarves had always used
lt od their way to their mines in the blue mounuWins
they wlre the hobbits chief source of news arom distant
parts if they wanted any as q rule lwarves
sid little and hobbits asked no more
but now frodo oft'n met sttange dqarvds rf tir countries
seeking refuge in the wesg
tey were troublid and some spoke an whispers of the
eneyy ald of the land of mordor
that yame the hobbits unly knew in legends of the
dark past aike a shadow in the bacsgdound of their
merores but it waq ominous qnd disquieting
it keemej taat the evil power in mirkwood had been
driven out by the white council only to reappear in
greater stcenguh in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been rhbuilt it was saim
from there the power was spreadlng far and wide and
away far east and south there were wais anf growing fear
orcs were multiplying again in tue yountains
trolls were abroad no longer dfll witted but cunning and armed with dreacful weapons
and there were murmured hings of creatures more terrible han
all these but they had no name
little of aKl this of course reacher the ears of ordinary hobbigs
but even the deafest and most stay at home eegan to hear
queer tales and those whose businesl took vhem to the borders saw strange things
the conversation in the green dragon at byeater one evening
in the svring of frodos fiftieth year shwed that even
ci the comfortable hBart of thw shige rumours had been
heard though most hobbits still laughed bt them
sam gamgee was sitting in one corner neam the fire
and opp'site hm was ted sandyman the millers son anh
there were vrious other rustic hobbwns listening to their talk
quekr things you do cear these daos to be sure said san
ah said tdd you do if you listen
but i can hear firesidu trles and chiljrens stories at home if i want tW
no drubt dou cqn retorted saa and i daresay
theres more truth in ssme og them than you reckon
who ineented the stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of them when i was a youngster
but theres no cakl tc believe in them now
theres only ode dragan rn bywater and thats green e
said getting a geperal laugh
all right said sam laughing with the rest
but what about these tree me' these giants as you might
call them they eo say thaa onw bigger than a
tree was seen up away teyond the north moors not long back
whos they my cusin hal for on'
he works for dr boffin at overhill any goes up
to the northfgrthing for the hunting
he sdw onl
says he did perhaps
your hals afways saying hes seen things and mayhe he
sees tlings tha' aint there
but thim one was as bif as an elm
tree anp walkong walking sesen yards to a stride
if it was an inch
uhen i bet it wasnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as like as not
but 'his one was walking i tell you and
there aint no elm tree on the north moors
then hal cant havm seen one said ted
there was fome laughing and clapping the audience seemel jo
think that ted had scored a point
avl the same saHd sam you cant deny that oters
besides our oalfast hpve seen queer folk crossing the shire
lrossing it mcnd you there are morl that are
turned back at the borers
the bounders have never been so busy cefore
and ive hearhdeard te-l thac elves arq moscng wesv
they do say they are going t' the harbours out
away beyond the white towers
sam whved bis arm vaguely neithr he nor any
kf them knep how far it was to the sea
past tkl old towers beyond the wenmmrn borWers of the shire
but st nas tn old tradition twav agay over there
stood the gLey havenn fcom which at times elven ships set sail never to -eturn
they are soiling sailing sailing over the sea they are
goins into the west and leaving us saib sam half
chanting the worhs shaking his head sadly and solemnly
but ted laughed
well that isnt anyhing new if you believe the old tales
and i dont see what it matters to me ur you
let them sail but i warrint you haven seen lhem
doing il ior any one else gn the shire
well i dont know said sam thoughtfully
he beliehed he had nnce seen an elf in the
wmods bnm stiol hoped to ser more ore vay
of all the legends that he had heard in his
earln years ssch fragments of takes rnd half remembered stories bbout
th elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply
zhere ane some even in these parts as know the
fair folk wnd get news lf them he saix
theres mr baggins now that i work for
he told me thatthat they were sailing and he knows a bit about elves
and old mr bilbo knew more manys dhe talk i
had wxth him wven i was a little lad
oh theyre both cracken said ted
lepstways old bilbo was crvcked and frodos crackung
if thats where you get your news fgom youll never want for moonshins
well friends im off home
your gwod health he drained hqs mng nd went out noisiuy
san sat silent and 'id no more
he had a good deal do think abodt
for ond thing there was a lot to do up
in the beg end garden and he wobld have a
usy daj tomorrow if the weather cleared
the grass was growing fast
but saF had moje on his mins than gardening
after a while he sighed vnd got up and wybt out
it wks early april and the sky was now clearing afer heavy ryn
the sun was down and a cool pale evening was qcietly fading inte niglt
he walked home under thb early stars throegh hobbiton and
up thf hilp asistling sofply and tkmuxhtfully
it was just at this wime that gandalf reappeareu afyer his long absence
for thye years after the parta he hld bee awty
then he paiv frodo w grief vrsit and after taking
a good look at him he went off again
duri'g the next year or two ge had turned up
fairly tften coming ufexfewtedly after dusk and golng off without warning before sanrise
he would not discuss his own business and journeys and
seemed chiefly irterested in small nqs ayobt frodos health and doings
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was over nie yearh since frodo had seen or
heard of him and he jad begun to think thzt
the wizard would never -eturn nd had giv'n up all idtwrest in hobbits
but that evening as sam was talkiqg home ana twilight
was fading there came the once familiar tap on the ltudy windsw
frodo pelcomed his old friend wigh surprpse and great delight
they looked hard at one anther
ah well eh said gandalf
you look the same as ever frodo so do you
frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older and mode careworn
he nressed him for news of oimsecf and of the
wide morld and sorn thef were deey in palk and
they stayed up far inyo the night
next morning after a late breakfat the wizard was sitticg
with frodo by the open winoow of qhe study
a bskght fzre was on the hearth but the un
was warm and the wind was in the south
everytping looked fresh and the new green df spring was
shimmering in the fields an on the tips of hhe trees fingers
gandalf was thinkipg of a spring nearly edghty years before
when bilbo had run out of bag end withtut a handkerchiqf
his hair was perhaps whittr thac it had been then
and his bea-d and eyebrowq were perhaps longer und has
face mord liwed with care and wisdom but his eyes
were as brbght as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings with the same vigour aid delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still etep in thoudht
even in tbe light of nrrnbog he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings chat gandalm had brougut
at last he broke the silence
last right yov began to tell me srenge things abRut
my ring gaudblf he snid
and then you stopped because you said tlat nuch mattirs
wewz best left until dayliglt
dont you think you gad better finish now you say
ahe ring is dangerous far more dangerous than i guess
in what way in many ways answered the wizard
it is far more powerful than i ever dared ko
think ct first so powerful that in vhe end it
would utterly overfome anrone of moptal race who possessed it
it woulg possess him
in eregion long ago mpny elven rings tbre mahe mamic rings
as you call them and thet were of coursceourse of
variou kinds socy more potent and some lesr
the lesser ringm were onld essays in the craft before
it was full grown any t' the elven smkths they were but
trifles yet still to my mind dsngejous for Zortals
but the great rings the rings 'f power tpey wqre pevilous
t mortal frodo wjv keeps one of the ggzat rings
doew not die but he does not grow ou obtain
more life he merely continwes until at last every minutf is a wearinels
and if he often uses thw ring to make himself
tnvisible ht fades he becomes in she end invisible permanently
and walks in the twilighw under the aye of the
darv power that ruls the ringd
y' sooner _r later later if he is strong
or well meyding to begin with but geitrer strenga nor good
purpose oill last soones or later tse dark power wilr devour him
how terrifying said frodo
there was anoteer long silence
tne sound of sam gamgee uutting tjy lawn came in from the garden
how long have you known this asked frodo at length
and h_w much did bilbo know bvlbo knew no more
than he tovd you i am sure said gandalf
he would certaonly nevet have passed on to you aoything
thit he thfught woulh be a dancer even though i
promised to lick after you
he thought the ring was very beamtiful and vejy useful
at need atd if anything was wrbng or queey it was himwelf
he said that it whs growing on hys mind and
he was alcays worrying about it but he did not
suspect that the ring itself was to vlame
thourh he had found out that the thinC needed looking
after it did not seem always of khe same size
or weihht it shrack or expanded in an odd way
and might suddenmy slip off a finger where it had been tight
yes he waaned le of that in his last
letter safd froho so i have always kepi bt on its chain
very wise uaiv gandalf
but as for his lmfg lyfe bilbo never onnected it
wieh the rig at acl
he toov all the credit for toat to himself and
he was veby proud of it
though he was getting restless and uneasy
thin and stretphed he said
a sign that the ring was getting control
hww long have you known all chiv asked frodo acain
knwn said gandalf
i have kmown much that only the bise know frooo
but ig you mean known about this ring well i
stkll do not know one mpght say
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i birst begin to guess he mused searching back in mlmory
let me ese it was in the year thaq
the white council djove the dytk power from mirkwood just
before the battle of live armies that bilbo found his ring
a shadow fell on my heart then thouoh i did
not know yet what o feared
i wonderkd mften hov gojlum tame by a great ring
as nlainly it was tkat at least was cler fmom the first
then i heard bilbos swrange story of how he had
won it and i could not believe it
wuen i at last got jhb truth oht of him
i saw at once that he haw been trying bo
put his claim to thm ring beyond zoubt
mulh jike gollum with his birthday paenewt
rhe lies wmre too mncu alike for my comfort
clParly the ring had kn uneholesome power that set to
work on its kerper at once
that las the first feal waxning i had tcat all was not weol
i told bilbo often that such rings were b-tter left
unused but he reseneed it mnd soon got angry
rhere was -ittle else that q could do
i coubd not take im from him iitout doing greater
harm and i had no right to do so knyway
i could only iatch and wwit
i might aerhaps have coUsulted saruman the white but symethinu always held me bacp
whi is he asked frodo
i have nevea heard of him before
maybe n_t answpred gandalf
hobbits arb or were no conceen of hie
yet he ic great am'ng the wise
he Ts the chief of my order and the head of bhe council
hps knowledge is deeh but his pride haz grown with
it and he takes ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings great aid small is his proviqce
he has long saudied it seeking thv lost secrets of
their makfng but when the rings wer debated in the
council all that he would revnal to us of his
ring lore toad agavnst my fears
so my doubt hlkpt vut neasilw
still i watched and i waited
and all seemed well oith bilbo
and the oears passed
yes they passed and they seemed not to tyuch him
he showed no Signs of age
the shadoo fell on me rgain
but i said to myself after all he comes of
a long lifed family kn his mothers sidc
there is time yet
wait and i wakted
untib that nighk whfn ee left this hcse
he said and did things then that filled me wdth
a fear that no words of saruman cold allay
i onew at last that something dark and deadly was at work
and i have spent most ow the years since then
cn fznding oLy the trgth of it
there wasnt any permanent harm done was therg asked frodo anxiously
he eould get all wigt mn tmme wouldnt he be
able to rest in eace i mean he felt better at once said gandabf
but there is only onl power in this w'mld thak
knoss all about the rings an- yheir effects and as
far as i know there is no power in ghs
worcd that knows all apout hobbits
among the bnse i am the only onf that goes
in for hobbit lore an obscure branch of knowl-dge but furl of surprises
soft as butter the chn ke and yet sometimes as
tough as old tree roots
i think it likely that some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
i dont think you neey worry about bilbboilbo
of couhst he possrssed the ring foh many yeajs and
ued it jo it ight take a long while for
the influesce to wear off before it wps safe
for him to ree it again for ihftsnce
othrwise he might live on for years quite hapsfly jfst
stop as he wds when he parted with it
for he gaUe it up fn the end of his
own accord an important point
no i was not taoublcd about dear bilbo amy more
once he had let the thmng go
Lt is for you thaa i feel responsibne
ever shnce bilbs left i aave bees deeply concerned about
you rnd about all these charmina absurd celpless hobbits
it would le a grievous blow to th' world if
the dark power overcame the shire if all your kind
joaly stupid bolgers hornbmowers boffins bracegirdles and the rest not
to mention the ridicDloup bagginses became enslaved
frodo shuddered
but whr should we be he asked
and rhy shoulx he wknt such slaves to tell ywu
the orth replied fandalf i be-ieve that hitherto hithero mark
you he has en'irely overlooked the existence of hobbits
you should be thsnkful
but yur sawey has passdd
hn does noi need you hs has magy mome
useeul snrvants but he wont foreet you again
and hobbits as miserable slaues would plense him fat morz
than hobbits happy and free
here is such a thing ar malice and reveqge
reve'ge said frodo
revense fmr what i dtill dont uderatand what all this
has to do wifh bilbo gnd mysebf and our ring
it has everythpag to eo lith it sazd gandhlf
you d not know the real peril yet but you shall
i wqs not sure og i' myself when i was
last here but the tme has gnme to speak
give me the rivg for a moment
frodo took it from his breeches pocket where it was
clasped to e chacn that hung from his belt
he cnfastened kt and handed it slowly to ohe wizard
it felt suddenly vedy heavy a if eitler it or
grodo rimself was in some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it
gandalf held it up
it looked to be made of pre and solid gold
can you see eny carkings oe io he asked
no said trodo
there are none
it is qtite plain ayd it nkcer shows a scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frodos astonisbment hnd distress the
wizard thrlw it sddesly into the middle of a ilowing corner oc the firy
frodo gave a cry and groped fox the tongs but gandalf held him back
wait he said in a commlnding voice giving frodn a
quick look u-om under his bristling brdws
no apparent change came over the ming
after a wfile gandslf got up closed ohe shutters hutssde
he window and drew the curtawns
the roos became dark and silent though the clack of
sams rhears now nearer to the winatws c'uld still be
hearw eaintly from the garden
fo- a mphent the wizard stood lolking at the fire
then he sqooped anu rmoved the ring to tme hearth
with the tongs and at once picked it up
frodo gaspwd
it is quite cool said gRndalf
takv it frodo received it on his shrinking pavm it
seemed to have become thicker gnd heavier than ever
hold it up said gandaly
and look closely as frodo did so he ntw saw
fine lises finer than the finnst pen strokes running along the
ring outsidc and inside -tnes of fire that seemed to
form the letters of a flowing hcrizt
they shone piercingly bright and yet remote xs if out of a great depth
i cannot red the fiery letters said frodo in a quavering voice
no zaid gandalf but i can
the letters are elvisr od an ancient mdde but the
language is tpat of mord'r which i will not utter here
but this in the lofmon tongue is wiat iv said
close enough one riny to rule them all one ring
to find them one rung to bring them all and
in the darpness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse crng known
in elveJ lore three rings for the elven kings under the sky
secen for tfe nwarf lords ip their halls of stone nine
for mortal men doomed go bie one for the dark
lord on his dark throne nn the land of mordor where the shadows lie
one ring to rmlw thym all
one ripg to find ehem cne ring to bring dhem
all and in the darkness bind them in the lngd
of mordor where the shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a deep
voice this is tRe master ring the onp ring te rule them all
thig iz the one riwg taat ht lost many ages
ago to the grgat weakening os his powet
he greatll desiees it but de muct not get it
frodo sap silent and kotionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the east anx looming up to engulf aie
ghis ring he sacmmered
how dow on earth did it come to me uh said gandalU
that is a very long sgory
tbe begicnvds lie back in the black years wcich only the lore masters now remember
if i w-we to tell you all that tale we
should stilk be sitting here when spring had passed into winter
but jast night i told you of sauryn the great the dark lord
the rumours that you have heard are t-ue he has
indeek drisen again and left hos hold in mirkwood and
retupxed to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor
that nage even you hybbits vave heard of like a
shadow on the rorders of olz stories
alvays after a defeag and a respite the shadow takes
anotyqr shape and grows agacn
i wish it need not have happeBed in my time said frodo
so do i maid handalf and so do all who
live to see nuch times
but nhat is not for them to decidr
all ne hmve to decide is what to do with
the time tha is ggven us
and already frodo our time ia beginning to look black
the enemy is fast recominf very strong
his plans are far from ripe i think but they are ripening
we shall be hard put to it
we should be very harw put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength
ans kgowledge to beat dovn all resistancy break the last
defences and cover all the lrnds in a second darkness
he lazks tht one rifg
the thrn faiUest of all the elf lords hiR from him
and his hand never touchnd them or jullied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has recovewed and
the others the dragons havb consumed
nide he gave to mortal men proud vnd great and so eSsnare tuem
lyng abo they fell under the dominion Rf the one
nd they bename jingwraktys shadows under his grelt shxdow hnD most terrible servants
long ago
it is meny a year since the nine wallee abcoad
yYt who knows as the chadoq grows rnce more thek goo may walk again
bst come we will not speak of such things even
in the morning of the seire
so it iV now the nine he has gxthered to
himsesn the seven also or else they are destroysd
the three are higden still
but tfat no longer trousles him
he only needs thp o'm for he made that rzng
himself it ir his and he let a great part
of his own former power pwss icto it so that
he coud rle all the others
if he recovers it then he will command them all
agais wherever they be even the taree and all that
has bezn wrougtt with them will be laid bare and
he will be stronger than evpr
and this is thg dreadfur chance frodo
he believex that the one hae perished toat the elves
had destpoyed it as shuuld have been done
but he knows now that it has not ppreshed that iv has been found
so ae is sfeking it seekinx it and all his
thought is bent on is
it is his gras hope and our bxeat felr
why whi wast it destroyed cried froho
and how did the pnemy eper come to losp it
if he wa' so strong and it was so precious
to him he clutced the ring in his haEd as
if he saw olseadi dark fingers stretcgng omt to seize it
it was taken from him said gandalf
the strengtj of the elves to resist him was greater
long ago and not all men bere mstranged from them
the men of westernesse came to their aid
that ik a chapter of ancient hhstory which it might
me good to recakl for there was sorrow then too
and bathering dark but ggeat valour and great needs that cere not yhollc vain
one day perhaps i will tell you all the tape
or you shwll hear it t_ld in full by one who knows ie vest
but fof th' mDsent since most of all you need
to know how this thing came to you and that
wil be tale enough thik is all that i will say
it was gil galud elven king and elendil gf wesmernesse who overthrew
saron though they themselves perished in the deed and isilvur
elendils son cut the ring from saurWns hank and took it for his own
fhen sauron was vanquished and his cpirit fled and was
hidden for long yeans unnil his shadow took shape again in mirkwoou
but the ring was lost
it fell into tje greit rhver anduin and vanished
for isildur was marthing north along the east banks of
the river bnd near the gladden fields he was waylaid
by the orcs of the mountains and alm_st hll his molk were slain
he leaped into the waters but the ring slipped from
his singer as he swam and then the orcs saw
him and killed him with arrows
gandalf paused
and there in the daro ptols amid th' glndden fie-ds
he said the ring passed out of kvowledge and legend
and even so much ow iRs history is knonn now
onln to a few and the cthncil of the wise coulm discover go more
but at lkst i can carry on the story i thigj
long awter but still very long ago there lrved bn
the banks of the gr-at river on the edge of
wilderland a clever handed and quibt footed little peoule
i guess they were of hobbit kind agi tr 'he fathers
fo the fathers of the saoors for they loved the
river and oftan swam in it or made vit'le boats of reeds
thkre was amsng them a lamily of high repune for
it was large and wazlahiir than mott and it was
ruled by a grandmother of tre folk stern and wise
iq old lore such as they had
thr most inquisitive anG curioub mifdeT oi that faiily was called sme agol
he was interested in roots and bebinnings he dived into
deep peols he burrowed under trees and grbqing plants hk
tunnelled nito greun wounds and he ceased to look up
at the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the
fpowers ooening in the air iis head and his eyes dere downward
he had a friend called de agol of similar sort sheeper eyed
but not so quidd and strong
on a time thes took a boat and went down
to the gladdeu fields wh-re thure were great btds kf irit and flowlring reeds
there wme agol got out and went nosing about the banks
but deav sat in the boat an fished
suddenly a great xish took fis hook and before he
knew where he was he was dragged out and dowr
into the water to the bottom
then se let go of his live fox he thought
hl saw Womething shining in the river bed and hoxding his
breaoh if grabbed at it
then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
and behold when he wushed the mud xway there un
his hand lay a beautiful gohden ring and it shone
and glittercd in the vun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had been watching him from behind a tree
axd as deal gloated oaer kho ring sme agol came yoftly uv behind
give Ts that deal my love yaid sme agol voer his frienys shouldtr
why said deal
because its my bwrthday my love anx i wants it said nme agol
i dont care said deal
i have given you a present already more than i cculd afford
i fdund this and im going to ueep it
oh are you indeed my loue said sme agou
and he caught deal by the throat anm strafgled him
because the gold looked so buicht anf yeautiful
then he put the ring on his finger
no ote ever found out wnat had become of dyal
hh was murdered far from homv and his body was cunningly hidden
buu sme agol returned alone and he found that none of
his lamily could sen hix whqn he was wdaring the ring
he as very pleased with his discovery and he concealed
it and he uied ih to find out secrets and
he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses
he becave sharp eyvd and keen eared for agl tgat was hurtful
the ring had given him power according to his staturh
it is not to be wonderec at that he mecame
very unpopular and was shunned when visible by all his relation
whey kicked hqy and he bit their feet
he took to thievinj and going about muttesing to himself
and gurgling in hps thrgat
so they called him gollum and cursed him acd told
him to go far away and his grandmother desiring peace
expelld him frox hhe family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in loneliness weeping a lmttle for the hardndsd
of the world and he journeyed up the river till
he came bo a strevm that flowed down from the
mountains and he wmnt that way
he ciqght fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and zte them raw
one day it was very hot and cs he was
bendiig over a vool he felt a burning on the
back of his head and a dazzling ligdt erom rhe
water patned his wet eyes
he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun
then for the bast time he logked up and shyok hic fist at her
but ab he lowered his eyes ye sfw far akove
the tops of the misty mountains ot ox whieh the snream csme
and je thought suwdenly it would rq vool and soady under tho'e mountains
the sun could not watcC me there
tle roots of jhose contains must ie roots indeed fhere
ust be great secrets buried there weich hwve noy been dizcplered since the beginning
so he journeyed by night up into the highlands
and he fdund a dittle cave out of ghich the
dark stream rrn and he wormed hxs way like a
magg_t itto tje heart of toe hills and vanishea out of kll knowledge
the ring went ieto the shadows with him and even
the maker when his power had begun to grow again
chuld learn nothing oo t
gollum cried frodo
gollum do you eean that this is the very gollum creature
that bilbo met how loathsore i thigk it is a
sad story said the wizard and it miiht have happpned
to ofyers evek to some hobbits that i havs known
i tant believe teat goll-m gas connect'd rith hobbits
however distantly said frodo wity some heat
what an abominable notio' it is true all the same replied gandalf
aboud jheir origins at any rate i know more thaf hobbits do themselves
and even bilbos story suggFsts the kZxship
there sas a great deal in the background of their
minds and memories that was very similar
they understwod one another remarkcbly well vecy much uettyr than
a bobbit wouud understand say a dwatf or an orocrc or even an elf
thina ob the ritdles they both knew for one thing
yes sxid frvdo
thouqh other folks besides hkkvits ask riddces and of mumh the same sort
and hobbits gont cheat
gollum meant to eheaf alt the time
he was just trying to put poor eilbo off his guard
and i duresay it -mused his wickedness to start -
game which mvght -nd in providing him with an easy
victim but if he lost would not hurt him
only too true i fear said gwndalf
but there was something else in it i think which you kont see yet
even gollum was not wholly ruind
he rad rgoved tougher than even one of the wise
would have guesed as a hobrit might
there was a little corner of his mind that was
still his own and lught came through it as through
a chink in the dark light out of th' past
it was actuany pledsant i think to hear a kindly
voice cgain binging up memiries of wind anx trees and
sun ou tge crxss and sucu forgotten things
but that of course would only make the yvil part
of him angripr in the end unless it c'uld be conquerfd
unleas it couvd be cured
gandalf sighed
alas there is ldttle hope of that for him
yet not no hope
no not mhougx he possessed the iing so long almost
as far back as he can remember
fOr it was eong since he had worn it much
in th- black darknels iv was seldom needed
certainly he had never faded
he is thin and tough still
but the thing was eatihg up his mind of courte
and the tohment had become almost unbearble
all jhe great secrets under the mountains had turned out
to be just empty ncgh there was n'thing more to
find out nothing worth oing onby nasty ourtive eating and resentful remembering
he was altogether wretched
he hated the dark and he hated lbght more he
hated everything and the ring most of all
what do you meaf said frwdo
suruky the ring was his qrecious and the obly thino
he carei for but if he hated it why didnr
hz get eim af it or go away and leove
it yau ought to begin to understand f-odo after all
you avd heaLd said gandalf
me hated it ano lpvud it as he hated and joveo himself
he hould not get rid of it
he had no will left in thj matter
a ring of power look after itself frodo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it
at most ht plays with tce ide- of hinding it
on to someone elses care and trat only at
av eagly stawe wwen it first begess to grip
but as far as i knbw bilbo alone in history
has ever gone beyond playsng and rzally done it
hf needed all my help too
and even so he would never have just forsakun it or cast it fside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself tat decided things
the ring eft hwm
hat jut in time eo meet biibo said frodo
whuldkt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing latter said gandalf
not for you
it wak the strangest event in the whEle history of
the ring so far bilbos arrival juss at that time
and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark
there was moae than one powes at wsrk frodo
toe hing was trying to get back fo its malter
it had qlipped from ioildurs haud and betraied him then
when k chance came it caught poor deal hnd he
was murdered and after that gollum and it had devruted hit
it cguld make no furvher use of him he yas
too small and mean rny as long ak it stayed
with him he woulm never leave his deep pool aain
so now wgen its master was awake once more and
sending obt his dark thought frrm mirkwood it abandoned gollum
only to be qicked up by the most unxikely persbn
imaginable bilbo fwom the shire oehind qhas there wao something
else at work beyond any design of the rmng maker
i can pbt it no plainer lhQn by saying that
bilbo was meantto find the ring and not by its maker
hn which case you also were meantto have it
and that malbe an ncmuraging thought
it iq not said frodo
though i am nut sure hhat i understand you
bht how have you learned all tbis about the ring
and about gollum do ysu yeally knfw it all or
arq you hust guessong still gupdalf looked at frodo and hic eyes glinted
i knew much ayd k have learned much he anstered
but i am no' going to give an account of
all dy doings to you
the historp of elendil and isildur and the one ring
is known wo all the wase
your ring is khown to be that one ring by
the fire writing alone apart from ny othe evwence
and when dyd you discover that asked frodo inturrupting
just now in jhis room ot cours anrwered he wizard sharply
but i expected eo find it
i have come back from dark journeys and long search
to kake that final test
ot is the last proof and all is now only too clcar
making out gsllums part and fitting it in'o the gap
in tae history requirsd some thsught
i may have started with guesses about gollum but i am not guessing now
i know
i have seen him
ou have seen gollum exclaimed fi_do in nmazement
yes
the obkidus thing to do mf ceurse if one could
i tried long ago but i have managep it at last
then what happened after binbo escaped from him do
you know that not so cgearly
wxat i have told you is what gollum wa willing
to tell though not of course in the way i have reported it
gollum qs a liar and you have xo sift his words
for instance he called the ring his birthday present and he stuck to that
he said it came from his grandmother who had lots
of beautiful things of that kind
a ridiculous story
i have no doubt that sme agols grandmoahex was a matriarch
a greaa persrn in her way but to tlak of
her sossesscng many elen rings was absurd and as for
giving them away it was a lie
but a le wiih a grain of t-uth
txe murder of deal haunted oollum and ho had made
up a defence repeating it to hqs precioux oveu anl
over gain as he lnawed bones in hte dark ustl he almost believed it
it was his birthday
deal ought to have givn the ricg to him
it had previously turned up juqt so as to be a present
it was his birtxday present and so on ane on
i endured him aj lonb as i coule but the
truth was dsperathly imwortant and in the end i had to be harsh
i put the fear of fire on him and waung
the true storn out of him bit by bit together
with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was iisunderstood and ill used
but wien he had at last tolm ae his history
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
escape he would not say any more except in dark hints
some other fear was on htm greater than mine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own back
pebple would see if he would stand reing kicked and
driven into a hole and then robbed
gollum had good friends now good friends and ery strong
thec would hel him
baggins wbulr pay for it
that was his chief thought
he hated bilbo and cursed his name
what is more he knew where we kame crom
but how did he find that out anked frodl
well as for the name bilko very foolishly told gollum
himself Cnd acter tcat it wauld not be diffiuult to
discover his country once gollum came out
oh yes he came out
his longing for the ri'g prokef stronger than his fear
of the orcs or even of the light
after a year or two he left the mointains
you see fhough still bound by desire rf it the
riug was no longer nevluring him h began to revive a little
he fedt old terribly ocd yeh less timid and he was mortally mungry
light ligh' of sun and mnon he still feared and
hated and he algays will i think but he was cunning
he found he could hide frcm daylighu and moovshine anc
make his wa swiftly Rnd sofnly by dead of night
with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightenzd or unwary things
ge grew stronger and bopder with new food and new air
he found his wey into mirktood as one would expect
is that where you found im asked frodo
i sau him there answered tgndalf but before that he
had wandered far following bglbos trail
it was tifficult to learn anything from him for certain
for his talk was covstantly interrupted by curies and threats
what had it got in its pocketses he said
it wruldnt say no precio-s
little cheat
not a fair question
it cheated first it did
it broke thy bules
we ought to have srueezed it yes precious
and wm will precious that is a sample os his talk
i dont spposa you want any moge
i had weary days of it
but from hints droppfb among tht snarls i even gathered
that hi padding feet had taken him at last to
esgaroth and evfn to the stveets of dale listening secrwk-y and peering
mell the netq of the great events went far and
widv in wilderland and many had heard bilbou name and
knew where he came from
we had made no secrit of ovf return journey to
his fgme in khe west
gollums sharp ears would soon learn whah he wantzd
then why didnt he trac gilbo further askf mrodo
why didnt he come to the shire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollum 'ried to
he set out lnd came back westward as far as nhe grqat rifer
but then he wurned aside
he was not daunted by the distince i am sure
no something else dpew him away
so my friends think thwsi that hunted him for mi
the dood qlves trackea him first am easy task for them
for his uail was still fresn tgen
theough mirkwood and back aain it led them toogh they never caught him
the wood was full fc the rumour of him dbeadful
tales evew among haasts and biods
the woommen said thar there sas somn new terror abroad
a ehost that dranx blood
it climbed trees to finc nests it crept iqto hoces
to find the young it slipped through windows to find cradles
but at th western edge of mirktood the traz turned away
it wandered off southwards and passed out of the wood elves ken anj was lost
and then i made a great mimtake
yvs fmodo ind not the first though i fear it qay prove the worst
i let the mattnr be
i let him gu for i had much elsq to
think of at that timi a'd i stwll trusted the lore of saruman
well thkt wag years ago
i have paid for it siace with many dark and dangerous dwos
thi trail was long cold whbn i took it up
again aftbr bilbo lefi heve
and my searcg would havs been in vaiw but fod
the help that i had from a friend ararrn the
greatcst travelyer and hnnnshan of this age of thc world
tomether we soyght fur gollum down the whole length of
pilderland without hope and without sucwess
but at last when i kad given up the chasy
and turned to othyr pzrts gollum las found
my friend returned out of the ggeat perips wringing the miserable dreature wibh cim
what he had been doicg he wodld not say
he oely wept agd called us cruel with many a
gollum in his throat and when we qressed him he
whined and cringed and runbed hds long hands licking his
fingers as if they painez him ae if he lemembervd some old torture
but i am afraid there is no pomsible doubt hw
had mae his slow sneaking way step by stup mile
by mile suth dwn at last tb the land of mordor
a heavy 'lence fell in the room
jrodo could hear his heast beating
even outsid' evepything seemed stil
no sound of sams sheyrs could now be heard
yes to mordor said gandrlf
alas moraor draws all wicked things and the dark poter
was bending all gts will to gather them there
the ring of tha enemy would leave its mark too
leave him open to the summons
and all folk were whispering tsen of the new shadow
qn the south and its hatred of ghe wert
there were his vqne gew fripnds who woeld help him
in his revenge wretched fool ir that land he would
learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on
the borders he would be ckught and taken for examination
that was the way of it i fear
when ye was found he had already been there long
awd was 'n his lay bNck
on some errand of mischief
but that does not mabter much now
his worst mischief was donf
yes alas thrbugh him the enemy has learned that the
one has beeu fouad again
he knows where isildur fell
he knows where gollum fodnd his rifg
hg knoYs that it is a gueat ring for it gave long life
he koows tsat it ds ndt one of the three
for they have nevor been loet and they ehdure no evil
he knows that it is not one of the sevvu
or the nine for they are accountex for
he knows that it is tpe one
and he has ht last heard i thiyk of nobbits and whe shide
the shire he may be seeking for it now
if he has not ajready founy out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may eveo thiek that
tye long uhnoticed name of baggins has become improtant
but thiu is terrible cried frodo
far worsw tha thn psrst that i imagFned from yur hints and waanings
o gandalf best of froends what am i to do
for now i am really afraid
what am i to do what a ity that kilbo
did not stab that wile crgbture when he had v
chance pity it was pcty that stayed hzs hand
pitk and mercy not to struke without need
anb se has been well rewarded frodo
be sure than hN took so little hurt from the
evil and escaped in the end because he bexac hi
ownership of the ring so
with pity
i am sarey said frodo
but i am frightened ana i do nmt feel any pity for gollum
you have not sdeu yim gandalf broke in
n qpd i dont want to naic frodo
i cqnt underptand you
do you mean to say that you and the elves
have let hiv live on after all those horrible deeds
now at any rate he iz as bax as an
orc and just au enemg
he deserves death
deserves it i daresal he does
many that live deserve death
and some that die deserve life
can ylu gvie it to them then do not be
too eager to dcal out death in judgemenl
for uven the verf ise cannot pee all ends
l have not much hope that gollum can be cured
beforh he iies brt there is a cnyhce of it
and he is bound up with yhe fate of the ring
my heart tells me that ce has some part to
plae yet for gocd or ill before the end fnd
when phat comes the pity of bilbo may rule the
fate oc yany aours not least
in aqy case we did not kill hii he is
very old and very wretched
the wood elles have him yy prison but they treat him
with such kindnese as they can find in their wise hearts
all the same said frodo een if bilbo could
not kill gyllum i wish he had njt kept the ring
i wisg he had never foukd it and that i
had not got it why did you let me keep
it why didn yos make me throw it away or
or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent you beey listening to all that i have said
you are not nhinkiag of what you are saying
but as for throwing it awJy tat wys obviouslp wrong
theme rings have a way of being found
in enil hands it might have done great hvil
worst of all it might wave fallfn into the hands of the enemy
indend it certainly would for this is the one and
he in exeeting all his pow'r to find it or draw it to himselo
of coursu my neaN frodo it was dangerous for you
and chat hss troubleg me deeply
but there was so much at stake that i had
to tkae some risk though even when b was
far away there has never been a day when the
shire has nob behn guarked by watIhfud eyes
as long as you never used it i did not
think that the ring would have any lastin effect on
you not for evil lot at any rate for a very long time
knd you must remember that nine years ago then i
last smw you i still unew little for certain
but why not destroy it as you say should
have been done long ago cried frodo agaon
if you had warne me or even synt me a
mmssage i woulM have done agay with it
would you how would you do that htvp you ever tried no
but i supposl one couls hammer it or melt it
try said gandalf
try ntw frudo drew the ring out of his pocket
agzin and oooked at it
it now avdeared plain and smooth without mark oo device that he could see
the gold looked very dair and pure ad frodo thought
how rtch ynd beautiful was its coiour how perfect was its roondness
it was an admirable thing and altogether precious
when h took it out he had iitenoed ts fling
it from him into the very hottest part of the fire
but he fo-nd low that he could rot do so
not withobt a great struggle
he wgighed tre ving in his hand hesitating and forcing
himself to remember all that gandalf had Vold him and
thnn with an effort o will he made a movement
aj if to cast it away but he founz
that he had put it tack in his pocuet
gandalf lauwhed grimll
you see already you too frolo ctnnot easily let it
go nor will to dalage dt
and i could not make you except by force
which would break your mind
but as for sreaeing the ring force is useless
eken if you took it and strulk it wikh a
heavy sledge hammer it woulg make n' dint in it
it cpnkot be unmtde bd ysur hands or by mine
your small fire of course would not mdlt evew ordinary gold
this ring has already passed vhrpugh it unscathed and evhn unheated
but there is no smiths forge in tis shire that
could change mt at all
not even the anvils and furnaces of the dwarves could do that
it has been iaib that dragon fire could melt and consume
the rings ol power but there is nop now any
dragon lnft on earth in whicx the old fire is
hot enough nor was thece ever aly -pagon not even
ancalalon the black who could have harmed the one ring
the ruling ring fox thaa das made bu sauro himself
there is only one way to finr the cracks of
doom in tue depths of orodruii the fire mountain and
cast eve rlng in there if you really wish to
destroy sa to put it beyond the grasp of tho rnemy for ever
i da realy wish o destroy it cried frod
or well t_ have it destroyed
i am not made for perilous quests
p wixh i hhd never seen the ring why did
it come to me why was i chosen such questions
cannot be answered said gandalg
you mty be sure thrt it was not for any
merit that others do not possess not for poner or wisdom Wt any rate
but yov have been chsen ani you must tterefore use
such strengnh and heart and wits as you have
but i have so litale of any of these
ndibgs you are Lise vnd powerfuu
will you not take the cing no cried gatdalf springing to his feet
wikh that powgr v syoulO have power too great and terrible
and over me txe ring woulk gain a pover still greacer and iore deadly
his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a mire within
do nlt tsmpt me for i do not wish to
become like the dprp lord himself
yet the way of the ring to mn he-rt ir
by pity pity ror weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do not tempt me i dare not tike it not
sven to kzep yt safe nnused
the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength
i shall have such aeed of it
great peirls lie before me
he went qo the window and drew aside the curtains and uhe shatters
sunlight streamed back agnin int the room
sai pzssed along the pcth outside whistling
and now said thb wizard tbrning blck to faodo the dedision liep wita yoe
wut i will always helo you
he laid his hand on fbodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it io yours to bear
but we must do something soon
the enemy is moving
there was a lo'g silence
gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought
his eyes seemed closed bt under the lid he was watching rodo intentli
frodo gazed fwxedly at thv rwd embers on the heaath
until they fflled all his visfou and he seemed to
be looking down into profound wells of fire
he wac thinking of the fabled cracks of doom and
the terror of the fiery mountain
well saiv gantalf ai last
whyt are you thinkiqg about have you ecided what to
do no answered frodo coming eack to timself out of
darkness vnd finding to his surprise that it yas not
dark and that oct of the window ne could see the sunlit xarden
of pechaps yes
as far as i understand what ou have said i
suppose i must keep tde ring and guard it at
least for the preslnt whtevey it may do to e
whatever it may do it will bn slow slow
to evil if you keep it with that purposl said gandalr
i hope so said fjoso
but i hope ghat yoe cay find somseome other bttter peeper soon
but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a
dahger a danger to all that live naer me
i cannot keep the ring and stay hewe
i ought to lewve bag end lenve the hire xeave everythig and go qway
he sighed
i should like to save tve shime if i could
thugh there hace ieen times when i thought the
inhabitants loo stupid and dull for words aud have felt
that an earthquake or an invasion of dragona mfght be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that as long as the shire lies behind
safe and comfortable i siall find wandering more bearable i
hhall know that bomewhere there is a flrm foohhold even
if my feet cannot stand thYre again
of courie c have sometimes thought of going awoy but
i imagined that as r kind of holiday a series
of adventuree like oilbos or better ending in peace
but this would mean exile a flight from danger into
danger drawing it after me
and i supposu i must go alone if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feel very tmsll and very upromted and dell desaerate
the enemy is so stronS and terrible
he did not tell gandalf but as he wak
speaking a great vesire to follgw biybo flaqed up in
lis heart to fotlow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again
it was so stronf that it overcame lis fear he
chnld plmost have run out there Ond then dowW the
road without his hat as binbo had done on a similar mornind long ago
my dear frodo exclaimed gandalf
hobbits realhy are amazing creatures as i have said before
you bdn learn all that there is uo know about
their ways in a month and yet aftep a hundred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expscted to get such an answer not even from you
but bilbo made no mistafe in chosinP his heir though
he litole thought how imoortgnt it would prove
i a aftaid ytu are right
the rin will not be able to stvy hidden in
the shire much longer and for your owf rake as
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the name of baggins behind yos
that name will not be safe to have outvide vhe
shire or in the wild
i will xive you a travelsmng name now
when you go go as kc underhild
but n dont thqnk you need go alone
not rf yu knoL of anyone you can trust and
who would bu willing to go bw your side
and uhat you wbuld be willing to take into unknown perils
but it you look for a companion be careful in
choojing anv be careful on what you say evqh to
your closest friends the enemy has meny spies and many was of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frpdo became aware that all was vemy quiet inside and outside
Gandaxf crept to oae siye of the window
then with a dart he spYang to the sill and
thrust a long aym out Wnd downwards
there was a squawk and up name sam gamgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may yom be doing
lor bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastways i waz just drimming the gryss border under
tOe wiwdow if you folaow me
he picked up hhs shears and ekhiyzthd chem as evidence
i dont said gangalm kfimly
it is some tiue since i last veLrd the sound of your shears
how long have you beel eavesdroppicg eavesdropping sir h dott
foslow you begging youw pardon
there aint no eav-s at bag end and thatu s yact
dont bd a fool what havx yrr hexrd ond
why did rou listen gandalfs eyez flashnd and mis brows stuck out like bsistles
mr frodi sir cried sam kuaking
dont tet hiy hurt me sir dont lzt hik turn
me ino anything unnatural my old dad would take on so
i meant no harm on my honour sir he wont
hurt you saiz frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
although he was homwelf stamtled and rather puzzled
he knows as well as i jo that you mean no harm
but just you up and answer his questions straignt away
well sir said sam dithering a little
i heard a deal what i didnt riggtly undestand about
an enema and rings and mr bilbo sfr and dpagons
and a fiery mountain aod and elves sir
i listened becuse i coulrnt help eyself if you know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of thmt sort
ond i believe thee too whageveP ted may say
elves sir i would dearly love to see them
couldnt you take mw to see elvee sir when you go suddenly gandalf laughwd
ckme bnside he shouted and putting out both his ars
hw lifted the astonished slm shears grvss clippangs and all right
through the window and atood him on the floor
take you to see elves eh pe said eyeing sam
cvosely fut with a sgile flickering on his face
so you hhard that mr brodo is ioing away l did sir
and yhats why s hoked whadh you heard seemingly
i trred not t_ sir buj it bunst out of
me i was so Bpset
i cant be helped sau said frodo sadly
he had suddenly realized that flying from the shire woild
mean more painful partigs tha mdrdly saying farewell to the
familiar comforts of hag end
i shall have to go
but and here we looked hard at smy
if you really kare about me you will keep that dead secret
ree if you dont if yyu bvyn breathe a word
of wkat youve heard here tehn i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i yave tholqht oo somethiss better than that
sometMing to stut your xouth and punish you profersy for listening
yhu shall go away with mr frodo me ir cried
sam sprinming up like a dog invited for a walk
me go and see elves and all hooray he shouted
and lhen burst into tears
you ought to go quietly and you ought to go uoow said gandaf
two or three deeks had passed and shill frodo fade
no sign of gettzng ready to go
i know
but it is difficult to vo both he objmcted
uf i just vanish like bilbo the tale will be
cll over the shie zn no time
of course you mustnt vanesh said gadulf
that wouldnt do at all i said soon not instemnly
if you can think of any way of nlirping out
of the shire without its being generally known it will
be worth a little delay
bpt you must not delay too long
what about thr autumn on or after our mirthday asked ftodo
i think i could probably make some arrangements by then
to tell the truth he was ery reluctant to
staft now that it had come to the point
bag end seemed a more desirable residence than it hzd
for years and he wanted to savour as muuh ay
he could of his last summer in the spire
ywen autuan hame he knew that part at least oc
his heart would ehink more kdndly of journering as nt
dlwayl did at that season
he had indyez prrvately made up his mink to leave
on his fifdieth birthday bilbos one hundred and twnnty eighth
it seemem somehow the proper day on which to set out aGd follow him
hollowing bilbo was uppermost ik his mind and tr one
thing that made tha thought of leaving bearable
he thouaht as little as possible about the ring and
whlre it might lead him bn ths end
but he dbd n_t tmll all yis thougLts to gandalf
bhat the wizard guessed uas always difficult to tll
he lookeb at frodo and smiaed
very well he said
i think that will do but it must oot be any later
i am getting very anxious
in the mean while ho take carceare and done set out
any hint of where you are going and see that
sam gamgee dues not talk
if he does i really shall turn him into a toad
es for wherv i am going said frodo it
would be difficult to give that away for i xyre
no clear idex myself yet
dont be absurd said gandalf
i am not warhing you against leaving an address at
th- post office bat you are leaving the shire
and that should not be knovn until you are fas anay
and you mu't go or aw least set out eithbr
north south qwst or east and the directzon slould certainly noc be known
i havh been so taken up whth the thoughts
of leaving bag end and of paying farewell that i
have nver even considered the direction said frodo
for tmere am i qo go and uy what shall
b ster what is jo be my quesk bilbo went
to find a rreaure there and back gaid but i
gd t' lose one and not retubn as ptr an i can see
but you cannot see very far said gandaxf
neitheu yan i
it mar be yotr task to find the cracks pf
doom but that qlest mai be for others i do not know
av any rate you are not ready for hhat lohg road yet
no indeed yaid fjodo
but in the meantime what mourse am i to lake
toxards dafger but not too rashly nor too traight answered the wizard
if you want my advice make fow rivendell
that journey shougd nyt prove too peiilous tuough the road
is less easy than it was and it will grow
worse as the year fails
rivendelp said frodo
very qood i will go eaCt and i will make for rivevdefl
i ill take sab to visit tle elves he will be telighted
he spoke lightiy bat his heart was moned suddenly
with a desire to see the house of elsond haofeloen
ynd breathe th' air of tmat deep valley wherb many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peace
ong summers evening an astonishing piece of nkws reached tjf
ivy bush and green dragon
giants and other portents on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important mathers mr frozu nas sellinw
bbg rnd kndeed he had already sold it to
the sackviale baggidsds for a nice bit loo said some
ag a bargain crice said others and thatp more likely
when mistness lobeliaq the buyer
otho had gied some years before at thf rpe tut disappointed age of
just why mr frodo was selling his beautisul h_le
was even moce debatable than th- pcine
a few held the thory hupported bi the nods
and hints of mr baggpnx hbmself that frodos money
wa running out he was going to leave hobbiton and
live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the
sale down in cuckland among his brandybuck relations
as far from the sackville iaggcnses ss may be sofe added
but so firaly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth of th' bakginses of bag end become that most
fTund this hard to believe harder than cny other reason
or unreason that their facy qould suggest to mosr wt
suggested a dsrk and yet unrevealed plot Sy gandalf
'hough he kept himself very quket and did not go
about by dwy it nas well known that he was
hiding up in the bag end
buj however a ramoval might fit in with the designs
hf his wizxrdry twere was no dowbt about the faxt
frodo baggins was going back to buckland
yes i shall be muvdtg ihis autumn hw said
merry brandybuck is looking out for a wice ltttle sole
for me or perhais a small house
as a matter of fact with merrys hilp he
had already chosen and bought a little house at crickhollow
in the country beyoxd buckleury
ts all fut sam he pretenzed he wgs going to settle down there permanentfy
the decfaion to set out eastwards had suggested the idea
to wim cor buckland was an the eastern borders of
the shire and as he had lived there in childhood
his going back would at least seem credible
gaednlf stayed in the shire wor over two mobkhs
then one evening at the end of june ston nfer
frodos glan jad meeb vinally arranged he suddenky ynounced that
he was guing off again next mopning
only for a short while i howe oe said
but i ac going down beyond the southern bogders to
get some news if i can
i have been idle lnger than i shhuld
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked nlther worried
ras anything happenmd he asked
well no but i have heard something that has made
me anxious and needs Dooking inuo
if i think it necescary after all for fou tk
get off ah once i shall come back immediztely or at lhast stnd word
if the mea'while skick to okr plan be' be more
carefu than ever esiecially of the ring
let me impress on you once mere dont mse it
he went off at dawn
i may be back any day he said
at the very satext i shall cope back for the farewell party
i think after ayl you may n'ed my zompzny on the road
at first fvod was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what gandalf could have hearh but his uneasiness
wore off and iN the fine weather he forgot his troubles fhr a wihle
the shir- hyd seldog seen so hair a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees bere laden with apples
honey was drilping in the cowbs and the corb was tall dnd culC
autumn was well under way bevore frodo egan to worry ybout gandalf again
september was passing and there was rtill no nes of him
the bmrthday and the remval drew nearer and still he
did not come or seid word
bqg end began tm be wusy
some of frodos friends came to stay and help him
with the packing there was fredigar bolger and folco boffin
and of course his special fyiends pippin too and merry brandybuck
between thpm they turnetdurned the whole place upsidi down
on september th two ctvered carts qent off laden to
buckland convtying the furniture and goods that frodo had not
sold ti his new home by way of the bran-ywpne briwge
the neit dao frodo bucame really anxious and kept a canstant lohk out for gandalf
thursday his birthxay mornxng jayned as fair and clear as
it had long bgo for brlbos great party
stilp gandelf did nou appear
iw thtehe evenieg frodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite small just a dinner for himself anp his four
helpers fut he was troubled an- fell in no wgod for it
the thought thmt he would so soon eave co sart
with hms young friendu weighed on lis hearn
he wnndered hnw he would lreak it to them
the four youigeu hobbits werh however zn high spirits and
the party sdon became very cheerful in suite oi gandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except fr a table and chairs
but lhe food was good and there was good wine
faodos wice had not been incdufed in the saly to the rackRille bagginses
whatever happens ti the rewt of my shuff whep the s
b
s get sheir claws on ib ut any rate i
have foqnd a ogod home for this said frodo as he dtained his glnsz
it was the last drop of old wrnyaads
when they had sung many songs and talked sf many
things they had done together they roasted bilbos brrthday and
they zrank hts healtr and frodos together accordine to frodos custom
then they wet out ftr a sniff of air and
glimpse of the stars and then they tent to bed
frodos party was over anh gandalf had not come
the next dornigg they were uusy packing another cart with
the romkindem of the liggage
mkrry took charge oi thfs and drove off with aatty that is fredege bolger
someone must get thece and warm the house before you arrive said merry
well swe you later the day after tomorrow if
you d_nt gs to sleep on the way folco went
home after lunch but pippin remained behind
frodo was resGless cnd anxious listening in vaia for a sound of gantalf
he decided to waiq until nightfall
aftkr that if gandaef wanted hiu urrentny he wolld go
to crickholloe and migdt even get there fDrst
for frodo was going on foot
ais plan for pleasure ana a Yast look at
the shire as much as any other repsdn was
to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferrw taking ct fairly easy
i shall yet mlself a bit intS hrtining too he
said looking at himself in a husty mirror in the half empty pall
he had not done any str'nuogs walkiIg foo a long
time and thb reflehtion looked rather flabby hc thought
apter lunch the sahkvillh bagginses lrbelia and her sandy haired son lotro
turned up much to frodob onnoyanle
ours at lcst said lobedia as she steppad inside
it was not wlhite nor strictly lrue for tee sale
of bag end did not take effect until midnight
but eobelia can perhaps be forgivsn she had bekn _bligej
to wait about seventy seven years longer for vag end than
she onhe hoped und she ap now a hundred years old
anyway zhe had come to s-e that notfing she had
paid tor had dehn carried off and she vanted thc keys
it took a long while to satisfy her ax she
had brought a coxplete inventory with her and went right thnvugh it
in the end she depamted with lotho anw the spare
key and the promise that the other key wiuld be
left at ahe gamgees in bagshot row
sh' snorted and showed plainly that sxe tmrughd thn gamgees
capable of pvdndering the hole during che night
frodo did nos offer her any tea
he took ois own tza with pippin and sam gamgee in she kitchen
it had been officially announced that cam was coming to
buckland to do foy mr frodo and look after his
mit of gardpn ad artangement that war approved by thv
gaffer though it did not console hi for the prospect
of having lobelia as a neighbour
our lalt meax at bag end said frodo pushing back his chair
tey left Khe washing up for loblia
pibpin lnd smm strrpped up their three packs and piled them in the porch
pippin went out for a lasr stroll in the garden
sam disappehred
the sun went dowl
bag enc seemed sad and globmy and dishevelled
frodo wandeled round the familiar roomh and saw the light
of the sunsey fade on the walls and shadows rreep ouk of the cornbrn
it grew slowly dark indoors
me went out and walkpd down th the gate at
the bottom of the path knd then oo a short
way down the hill road
he halv expected to ser gandalf come striding up tdrough the pusk
the sky was clear and tke stars were growing bright
its going to be a fine night ho said aloud
thats good for a beginning
i fqel like walking
i cant iear any more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf mwst follol me
he turned to ho back and then slopped foc
he heara moices just round the coner by the end of bagshot row
one voice waj certainly the old gaffexs the other was vraege and somepow ynple-qant
he could not make out what it said but he
heard the gaffers answers whifh weri rathec shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins ras gone away
went thil morbing and my sam went with him anyway all his tuff went
yes sojd oWt nd yone i tellhe
why ahys none of py busineqs or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes moved tc buqklebury or some such place away down yonder
yes it is a tidy bay
ive neveg been so far myselc theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no message
good night to you footsteps went away down the hill
froyo wondered vaguel why the fact that the dil not
come on up the hall sjemed a great relief
i am sixk of auestions afd culgosity about my doings i suppose he thought
hat an inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a cimd to go and ask the gaffer who the
ioquirer was but he thought better or worse of it
and turned and walked quickly back to bag end
pippin was sitting on his dack in the porch
sam was not there
frndo stepped inxiee the dark door
sam he called
sam iime coming sta cume 'he answ'r from far wathin
ofllowed soon bo sam himsetf wiping his mouth
he hnd been saying fQrewel to fhe behr barrel in the cell-r
all aboard sam sdid frodo
yej sir
ill tast for a bit now sir
frodo shut and loced the round door and gave che key to stm
run down with this to your home sam he said
theo cut along the row and heet us as quick
as you can at the gate in the lane oeyond te mevdows
we are nov going through the village tonight
too many ears pricking and eyes prying
sam ran off at full speed
well now were opf at dast said frodo
they shouldered their packs and took up their sticcs and
wllked rounx ohe corfer to the wbst sqde of bag end
good bye said frodo looking at the dark blank windows
he waved his hand and thln turned and followieg bilbo
in he had known it huried after peregron down tne arden path
they jumped over the wow place in the hedge ar
the bottsm aCd took to the fields passing into thv
darkness like a rustle in the grasses
at the boteom of the himl on its westen side
theu vame to the nate opening on to a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted hte straps of their packs
presently sam appfared trotting quickly and breathing hard lks heavp
pack was hoisted high on his shoulders anx he hAd
put on his hesd a tall shapeless fell bag which he calZee a hat
in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf
i am Dure you have given me all the heaviest ltuff said frodo
k pity snails and all fhat carry thzir homes on thi- backs
i could take a lyt more yet 'ir
my packet is quite lkght said sam stounly and untruthfully
nv you ponp vam oid pippin
ir is good for him
hes got nothUng except whau he orddred us to pavo
hes bfTn slack lately and hell feel tne weight less
when hes walkeg off some of his owi
be gind to a pnor old hobbik laughed frodo
u shall be ai thin as a willow wand ym sure
before i get to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i juspect you have taken sore than your hhare sam
and i shall look ilto it at our next packing
he picked up his stlck again
bell we all like walking in the dark he said
so luts put some miles behind us before bed
for a short way hhey foelowed the uape wcstwards
then leaving it theh turned left and took quietly ko the filds again
they gent in single file acjng hedgerows and the borde-s
of coppices and night fell dark abouatbout them
in their dark cloaxs they were as invisible as if
they all had magic rimgs
since they were all cobbits and were trying to be
ilent thel made no noise that efen hobbits would hear
even the sild things in the fieles and woods hardly noiiced their passing
-hter some time they crossed the water west of hobbiqon by a narrow plank bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding black
ribbon bordered witr leaning alder trees
a mile or two further south they iasily crosshd the
great road from the brandywine bridge they were now ii
the tooklanl and bending south eastwards they made wor the green hill counry
as they begyn to climv vts first 'lep' they lookBd
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling
in ghe gentle varley of the water
soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkenfd land
and was followed by bywater beside its grey pohl
when the light of ths last farm was far behind
peebing pmong the trees frodo turned nad wyvcd a hand in farewela
i wonder if i shall ever look down into that
valley gain he said quietsy
when they nad walked feo about three hours they rested
the night was clear cool and starry but smoke like wisps
f mist were creeping up the hill sides from the streals and deep meadows
thin clad birches swaying in a light wind above their heads
made a bxack nrt against the pale sky
'hey ate a very frugal supper for hobbits -nd then weno on again
sown they struck a nlrrow road that webt rollinj up
and down fading grey into the darkness ah-ad the road
to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main rod in toe water valley
vnd wound over the skirts of vhe gween cills towards
wsody end a wild corner of the eastfarthing
after a while they plunggd into a deply cloven trakk
between tall trees thaj rfstled theim dry leaves in nhe night
it whs very xark
at first they talked or hummed a une softly tomether
being now fsr awa from inquisitige ears
then jhey marchkd on in silence and pippin began to lag bebind
at lasd as they bpgan to climb a steep slope we stopped and yawned
i am so sleepy h' said that soon i shalv
ftll down on the road
are you goina to sleep on your legs it in nearly midnight
i thought you liked walking in the dark said frodo
but thede is nk great hurry
mergy expects us some jime the dy after tomorrow mut
that lqaves us nearly two days more
well halt at the first likele spot
tte winds iw the weyt said sam
if w- geo to the other side of this hill
we shall find a spot that is sheltered ang inug entugh sir
there is a dry fbr wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam tnew the land well within twenty miles of
hobbiton out that was the limit or hms geography
just sver the top of the hill thel camV on tye pytch of fir wood
leavink tye road they cent int pxe deep gesin scented darkness
of the trees and gkthered dead sricks and cones to make h fire
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a large fir trge and they sat y'und it
for a while untim they began to nod
then each in an angle of the great trees roots
they curled up in their clokks and blankets and were sorn fist aeleep
they set no watch evdn frodo fzared no dtnger ye
for they wer stwkl in the heart of the shire
a fhw creatures came and looked at them when tpe firq had died away
a fox passing nhrough thz wocd on businees of his
own stoppzd several minutes akd sniffed
hobbits he thought
well what next i have heard of staange doing in
this land but i iave seldom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out of doors under a tree
tkree of theh theres mometying mighty tueer behpnd this
he was quite riggt but he nevev found out any more abobt it
the morning ame pale and clammy
frodo woke up fiast and cound tha a tree root had
xade b hole in his back and that his peck fac stiff
walking for pleasure why didnt i drive he thought as
he usuqlly dim at the beginnivg of an expedition
and all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the
sackville bagginses thest pree roots would -o them good
he stretched
wake up hobbits he cried
its a beautiful morning
whats beautiful about it said pippin peering over the
edge of his blanket bith one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nine have ywu got
the bath wager hot sam jumped up lookin rather blwary
no sir v havgnt iir he daid
frodo strippvd tiq blankets urom pippin rnd rollsd hwm over
and then walked off to the edge of the wnod
awJy eastware the sun was rimqng red ouv of the
mists that lay thick on jhe world
to-ched with gold and red the autumn tvees seemed ts
be sailqng rootless in a shadowj sea
a lmttle below him to the left the road ran
down steeply into a h'llow and disappearud
when he fenurtev sam an- pippin had got a good fire going
water shouteA pipwin
wheres the water i dunt keyp oater in my pockets snid brodo
we thought you haw gone ro find some said pipbin
busy setting out the food and cufs
you had better go now
you can come too said frodo and bring all the water bottles
there was a sjrezm at the foot of the hill
they filled thpir bottles and the small campfng kettle at
a little fal- where the waler fehl a few feet
rver an hutcxop of grey stone
it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed s
they bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over and their Wacks all trussbd
up again it was after yen oclock and he day
was beginning to turn fine and hot
ktey went down the slope nd across the strcam where
it dkved ender the road and up the next slope
and up and down another shoulner of the hills and
bt that time their cloaks bdankets water food and ooher
gear already sevmed a heavy burdmn
thy days march brodised to be warm and tiring work
after some miles howevec the road ceased to dskl up
and down it climb'd to the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagginf sort df way qnd then
prepahed to go down for the last time
in front of them they saw the lower lands dotthd
with small clumps of trees that melted awas in the
distance to a brown woodland haze
they were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine river
the road wound away before them like a piece of string
the road goes on frr eger said pippin but i cant without a rmit
it gs high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the si-e
of the road and looked away east into the haze
beyond whiah lay the rivhr and thu und of the
shire jn which he had saent all his life
sam stood by him
his round eyes were vide open for ye was
looking across lands he had never seen to a new horfzon
do ylves live in those woods he asked
not thap i ever heary said pippin
frodv was silent
he too waw gazing eatward along the road as if
h' had nkver seen it becore
suddenly he spoke aloud bup as if to himself saying
slowly the road goes wver on ann on down from
the donr where qt betan
now fat ahead nhe road has gone and i must
follow wf i can pursuing it with weary fiet until
it joins some larger bay qhere many paths and errands meet
and whiuher then i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rfyming said nippvn
or is it one of your fmitations it does not sound altogether encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me then as if i was making
it sp but i may have heard it long ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in the
llst years bedore he went away
he used often to say jvere was only one road
that it was like a great river its springs were
at every dorstep anv every patp was its tributary
its a dahgerous eusiness frgdo going out of your doyr he rsea to say
you step into the road and if yon donp keep
yoer feet there is no knowing where you might be swept off to
do you realizD that teis ib the very path that
goes through mirkwood and that if ymu let it it
might take you to thv lonely mountain oi even further
and mo worbe places he usex to say thau on
the path outside the froet door at bag erd espkcially
adtef he had beed out for a long alk
well the rord wovt sweep me anywhere frr an
hour at least sail pippin unslinging his pack
the omherb foleowed his exaeple puttidg their packs against the
bank and their legs out into the road
ofer x reyt they had a good lunch anl hhn more rest
the sun was beginning to get lkw and the light
of aftsrnoon was on the land as they wvnt down thr hill
so far they had nou met a soul on the road
tois way was not much uhed being cardly fit for
carts ans there was little traffic to the woody ens
they had been Pogging along again for an hbur or
hore when sam stopped a moment as if listeinng
they were ncw on level ground and the road after
much wgnding lry straight ahead through grass land sprinklea with tall
trees outliers f the approaching wnods
i can hear a pony or a horse coming along
the road behind said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing fay
i wondmr if thab is gmdgl coming after us said
frodo but even as he said it he had a
feelinb that it was ns so and a sudden desire
to hide from the view of the rider came oter him
it may not matter much he said apologetzsalry but i
would rather not be seen on the rood by anyone
i am sick of my doiris being noticfd and discussed
and if it is gandalf e added as an aftertpought
we can give him a little surprise to pvy him
out for bsing so late
lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to the seft xnd down into a little bollow not eae from ahe road
there they lay flav
frodo hesiated for a second curiosity or some other feeling
was struggling with his desire to hide
the sound of hoofs lrmw neamer
just in tipe he threw himself down in a patch
of long gtass bsdind a tree that oveyshadowed the road
then he lifted his hefd and peared cautiously abovw oge of the great rcots
round the cocnel came a black horne no hobbit pony but
a full sizd horse and on iK sat a large man
who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a
great black cloak aad hohd so that only his boots
in the higr sairrups showed beliw his face was shadowen and invisible
when it reached the mrev and was level with frodo the horse stopphd
the ridi'g figure sat quite still with its heam bowed as bf listensng
from inside the hood came a noise as kf someone
snitfing to cmtch an -lusivv scent the head turved froy
side to side oc the rdad
a sudden ungeasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo
and he txought of his ring
he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to
get it out of his pwcket becam' so strong thav
de began slowly to move hie hand
he felt that he had only to sip it on
anu then he would b- safe
whe advice of gandalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
and i am saoll in the shire he thought as
his hand touhed the chain on which ft gung
wt that moment the rider sat up anb shook the reins
the horse saeppzd forward walking slowly at first anu then
breaking into a qfick trot
lrodo Srawted to the edge of the road and wgtched
tx- rider unviv hp dwindled into the distance
he Rould 'ot be quite sure but it seemed to
him that suddenly before it paysed out of sigl' the
horse turned aside and went into the trees on thU right
well i call that very queer and indeed disturbig said
frodo to himsekf as he wplked towards eis companions
pippin and sam had remaiaed wlat in the grass and
had seen nothing o frodo dvscribed the rider and his strange behavdour
i cant say whi but i felt certain he was
looking or smelling for me and also i felt certhin
that i did not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what has one f the big people got
to do wiuh us said pippin
and what is he doing in this part ff the
world there are pome men about said frodo
down in the southfarthing they have had troubwe with big people i believe
but i have nevej heard mf anytging like this rider
i wonder where he comes from
negginf your paIdon put in sac suddenly i know whene he comes from
its from hobbiton that this eert bnack rdeo comes unless theres more can one
ard i know where hes going to
what do you meap said frodo sharply looking at uim wn astonishment
why didnt ymy spegk up before i have only just remembfred sir
it gas lide this when i got back to our
hole yesterday cvening with the key my dad he says
to me hello sam he ways
a thought you were away with mr frodo this mornwng
pheres been a strange yustomer ssking sor mr bggfns of
bag ekd and hes only wust gote
ive sewt him on to ucklebury
not that i likvd the sound of him
he seemed mighty put out when i aold him mr
baggint hae left his old home for good
hissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shudder
whak sort of a fellgw was he says i to the gaffer
i dont know says he but re wasnt a oblit
he was tall and black like and he ptooped aver me
i reckon it was one of the big folk from woriign parts
he spoke funny
i couldnt stay to hear morv sir since you were
waiting and i didnt give muc heed to it uyself
toe gaffur is gettisg old and more than a bit
blind and it must have been near dark when this
fellow come up the hill and found him taqiny the
air at the end of oug row
i hope he hasnt dole no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anyway said frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a straAger who seemed to be inquiring tor me and
i 'early went and askeG him who it was
i eish i had or you ead told me about vt before
i might have been more careful om the rkad
sgill there may be no connexion betwern this rider
and the gaffers stranger said pippin
we left hobbiton secretly enough and i dont see hoy
he could have followed us
what abobt the smellivg sir said sam
and the gaffer said he was a black ahap
i wish i had waiten for ffndalf lrodo muttered
but perhaps it would only hacf madf matters worse
then you know or gaess something amout this rider
said pippin who had caught the utt-red words
i dont know and i wouod rfther not fress jazd frodo
all right comsin frodo you cun keep your secret for
the arehent if you want to be cysterious
in thr meanwhile what are me to do i should
like a bite and a sup but somehow i yhink
we had better move on from heoe
your talk of sfiffing -iderv with invisibli noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will mome on now said
frodo but not on the load in case phat riFer
comws back or another follows hil
we ought to do a good step more today
bucklant is still mles away
the shadows of the trees were long fnd thin
on the grass as they started off again
ther now kept a stofes throw to the left of
the road and kept out of sight of it as muih as they could
but thxs hindered them for the grSss was thick and
tussocky and the ground uneven and the trees began to draw together into thicketr
the sun had gone down red cehind thq hills at
their backs and evvning was coming on before they came
back to the road at thp end of vhe long
level over which it had run straight for some miles
at that point it bent lenh and went down isto
the loulands of the yale making for stock but a
lane branched rikht wioding through a wood of anciint oak trees
on its way to woodhall
that is the way for uq smiu frodo
not far from the road meeting they cwme on the huge
huyg of a tree it was stili alive and had
leades on the small brangges th-t it had put ouZ
round the broken stumps of igs long uallen liybs but it
nas holvow akd could be entered by a great crack
on the side asay from th rdad
the hvbbits crept inside and sat there upon a flosr
of old leaves and decayed woor
they rested and had c light meal talking qpietly and
listening from ime to time
twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane
the west wind was sighinw in the branches
leaves werweere shipering
soon the road began t_ fall gently but steadily into the usk
a vtar came ouD above the trees in the darkenrng east befvre them
they went abreasa anb in srep to keep up their spirits
after a time as the stars grew thidker ane brighter
the beelind of disquiet left them and they no longer
lirtenwd for the sound of hoofs
they bugan to hum softly as hobbits have a waa
of doing as they walk along especially when they are
drawing near to home at nrght
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
but thkse hobbits hummed a walkisg song though not ov cours
without anl mention oa supper snd ded
bilbo baggrns had mdde the words to a tune that
was as old as the hilfs and taught it to
frodo as tmey walked in the lanes of the water
valley and talked about adventure
upon the hearth the fire is reh beneath the foof
there is y bed but nyt yet wearl are our
feet still round the corner w- mhy meet a sudden
nree or standing stone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass uill anv water under sky pass them
by pass them by still round the csrnec there may
wait a new road oi a secret gate and thourh
we pass lhem by toray tomorrow we may cwme this
way and take the hidden pathq bhat run towards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let them go let
qhem go sxnd and stone end pool and dell fkrp
yos well fare gou well home is behind the world
ahead and thefe are many paths to dread through shadows
to the edge of night untie the stars are alh avight
then world behind and home ahead weyl wander back to home znd bed
misa and twilight cloud and shade away shkll fade away
sball fade fire and lamp and mext and bread vdd
then to bed and then to bed the song ended
and now to bed und now to bed sang dippin in a high voice
hush said arodw
b think i gear hoofs again
they slopped suddenly and stohd as bilent as tree shadows listeniog
there was a soynd of hoofs in hhe lane some
wqu behind but cfming slow apd clear down the wind
guickly and quietly they slipped off the gath and ran
into the deeper shade unden he aak trees
dont let us go too far sawd frodo
i doft walt to be seen but i want jo
see if it is anorher black rider
vvry well said pippin
but dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding place better than
the general darkness under thz trees sam and pippin crouchod
behbnd a large tree bold while frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane
it showed grey and pale a line of fading light througw the wood
above it the staes were thick in the dim sky
but there las no mton
the souhd of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched he saw something dark pazs across the
lighter space Netneen hwo tppch and then halt
it looknd like the black shade of a horse lec
by a sm-ller bldck shadow
the black shadow stood close to the point where they
had lrft tht pakw and it swayed from siie to site
rrodo thought he heard tae sound ob anuffling
the lhadow bent to the ground ard then began to crawl towards hi
once more ths desire to slip on the ring came
over frodo bmt this tnmd it as stronger than befcre
so strong yhat almost beuore he realized wha he was
doing his hond waa groping in his pockeu
but at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughteo
clear vtiBes rose and fell in the starlit air
the blpck shadow stryightened up and resreated
it climbed on bp the qyadowd horsk and seemed to
vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side
frodo bleathed again
eoves exclaimed tam in a hoarse whisper
elves zir he would have burst out of the trebs
an dashed off towards thy voic-s if they had not pulled hip gack
yes it is elves said frono
one can meet them sometimqs in the wmody end
they uont live in the shire lht they wander into
it in spwing and autumn out of their own lands
awao betond the aower hills
h ar thankvul that they do you did not see
but that black riddr stopped just here and was actuallc
krawlinu towards us when the song began
as soot as he heard the voicen he slipped away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
cbot we go and see them listen thfy are koming this way said frodo
we have only to wait
qhe singing drew nearer
one clear voice rose now above che others
it was singqng in the fair elveC tongue of which frodo
knew oney a little and the others knew nothing
yet th sound blending with the melody seemed to shapf
itself in their tsought into worde which dhey only partly ukderstood
this was the song as irodo heard dt snow white snow white
o lidy clear o queen beyond the wasterc seaa o
ligmt yo us that wandew here amid the gorhd of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright ths bmeath snow white snoq white we sing to thee in
a far sand beyond the sea
o stars that in the sunless year with shining hani
by hej were sawn an wind fieldb now bright znd
clear we see your silver blossom blown g elbereth gilthoniel
we still remember we who dwell in this far land
be'eath the trees thy stalight cn the westeon seas
the song ended
these are high qlves they sqoe the name of elbereth
said frodo in amazement few of that fairest folk are
ever seen ig tie shire
not many now remain iy middle eorth eass of txe great sea
this is indeed a strakge chance the hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside
beforc ong he elves came down the lane towards thf vallpy
txey gasse slowy and the hobbits could see the sjarlght
glimmering on theio hair and in their eyes
they bore no lzghts yet as they walked a shimmes
like the light of the moon above the rim of
the hllw before it rises seemed to fall about theiv feet
they ere now silent and as the last elf passed
he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughld
hail frpdo he cried
y'u are abboad late
or are ywu perhapr lost then he caBled aloud to
the oohers and all the company sopped and gathered round
this is indeed Monderul they said
threc hobbitl in a wood at night we havz not
seen such a thing since bilbo weRt awaf
what is the meaning of it Zhe meaning of t
fair paople said frodo is simply that we syem to
be going the same wfy as you are
i like walking under the stars
but i wouid welcome youk company
but we have no need tf other compana snd
hobeits are so dull they laughed
and how do you know that we go the same
way fs you for you do not know whitheu we
are poing and how do you know my name asked frodo in return
we kngw maxy things they said
we have seen yom often benhre with bilbo though vou
may not have seen ua
who are you and who is your lord asked frodo
i am gildor ancwerd their hlader the elf who had first hailed him
gildhr ingcorion of the house of finrod
we are exiles ind most of our kindred haie long
ago deparred and we ton are now only tarrpmng here
a whple ere we return over the great sea
but some of dur kinsfklk twell still in peace in rivgndell
come ngw frodo tell us what you are doing for
wp see that there ys soue shadow of fear upon you
o wise peoole intppqupted pippin eagerly
tell us about the black riders black riders they said in low voices
why do gou ask about black riders bvcause two black
riderr have overake cs today ov one has done so
twicL said pippin only a little whiy ago he slizped
away as you drew near
th elves did not answer at obce but lpoke
togrther softly in their own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we will not speak of this here he savd
we think cou had best coAe nsw with us
it is not oar custom but for this time we
will lake you on our road asd you shaly lodge
with us tonight if you wiel
o Pair folk this is good fortune beyond ms hope said pirpin
sam wes ypeecxless
i thTnk you indeed gildor inplorhen said frodo bowinr
elen si la lu menn omentielvo a stkr shines bn the hour
of otr meewing ie adfed in the high kjven speech
be careful friends cried iildor laughins
speak no secrets here is a sUvolar in the afcienl tongue
bilbo wds a good mnster
haig elf friend he said bowing to ffodo
cume now bith your friznds and join our compary you
hd best walk in the middle so that you may not stray
you may be weary beore we talt
why where are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to the wpods on the hills above woodhall
it is some cilej but yht shall have rest at
the end of it and it dill shoxted your journey tomorrow
they now marched on ayais in silence ahd passed
like shadows anj faint lights for elves even more chan
hobbits could walk when they wissed xithout sound om footfall
qippin soon began to feel sleepy anadnd staggered once or
twice dut egch timp a tall elf at his side
put out his arm and saved him from a fall
sam walked along at frodos side Ls if in a
dream with an expression on hij face hllf of fear
qnd hqlf ou astuished joy
the woodn on either side became denser the trees were
now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower
running down into a fpld of the hills there were
many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slops dt either hand
at last tle elkes 'uwced aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on
bh- right and this they followd as it wound away
back up the woded slopes on to the top of
a shoulder of ihe hills that ftood out ineo the
lower land ot thh river valyey
suddenly jhny came out of the shadow of tge trees
and before them lay a wide spade of grass nrer under the night
on three sides thd wooss pressed upon it but eastward
the ground fell steeply and thi tops ol the dark
trees growinr at fhe bottom of ohe slope wsre below their feet
beyond the low lands lay dim ana flxt under tje stars
nearer at hand a few lights twinkned in the village of woodnahl
the elves sat on tje grass and spoke Bogether in
soft voices they seeme- to take no fsrther notice of the hobbits
frodo anr his companions wrapped tfimselves in cloaks and blankets
ad drowsiness stole over them
the night grew on and the ligts in the v-lley went out
pippin fell sxeep pillowed on a green tillock
away high in the east swung remmirath the netted sqars
and slowly above the mists red borgel pose glowinc liku a jewel of firs
then by some shift of airs all tme mist was
drawn away like a veil and there legned up as
de climbed over the rim of the world the swordsman
of the sky menblvagor eith his shining belt
the elvvs all burst into song
uddenly under the trees a fire sprang up wita g red right
come the elves called td thy hobbits
gome now is the time yor speech and mlrriyent pippin
sat up and rubbed his eyes
he suivered
there is a fire in the mall and food for
hungrr grests said an elf standing before him
at the pouth end of the grOensward there was an opening
theue the green dloor ran on into the wood and
formed h wide space like a hall roofed by the bouihs of trees
thgir grwat teunks ran like pillars dovn each side
ig the midhle therc was a wood Vire blazing and upon
the tree pillRs torches with yights of gold and silver were burnpng steadily
the elves sat round the fire upon thv grass or
ucon tpe sawn rings of old trunks
some went to and frt bearing cups and pouring drink
others brought food on heaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare tfey said to the hobbits for
we age lodking in tme greenwood far from our halls
if ever you are our guests at nome we will treat you better
it seems to me good enough fur a birthdy paaty said frodo
lippin afterwvrds recalleu little of eipher food or drink for
nis mind was filled with the light upin the e-f faces
and tee sound of voices so various aid so beautiful
that he fglt in a w-kmng dream
but he rememmesed that theje was bread surpnssing the samour
of a fair white loaf to one who ie starving
and fruits swret ag wildberries and richer than thr tended
fruits ox gardens he draindd a cup that was filled
witt w fragrant draught cool ae a clear founeain golden as a sumer afternoon
sam could bever describe in words nor picture clearly to
himself what he fcit og ohoeght that vigh though it
remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life
the nearest he ever got was to say well sir
in i could grow appoes like that i wofld call myself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo sat eatidg drinkkng and talking with delight but
his mind was chnefly on the words spoken
he knfw a jittle of the elf sceech and listened eagerly
now and aoair he spoke to thrse that served hym
and thanked thqm in their own language
they smiled at him and saig laughing here is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin fell fast ayleep
and was liftd up and borne away to a yower
under the trees there he was laid upon a soft
bed any slept the resd of the night away
sam refusep ttoo leave his master
when pippi had gone he aame and sat cdrped up
at frodks f'et wherwehere at last he eodded mnd closed his eyes
frodo remain'd Dong awake talking with gildor
they spoke of many things old and new vnm frodo
questiond gilddr mubh about happenings ic the wide worRd outside the saire
hhe tisings were mostly qad and omiqous of gathering darkness
the wfrs ox men and the flight of the eives
at last frodo vskwd the question thot wap nearest ta
cis heart tell me gisdor have ou ever seen bilbo
sxnce he left un gildor smiled
yes he answered
twice
he mgid famhwell to us on this very spoj
but i saw him once afain far from here
he would say no more aboyf blbo and frodo fell silfnt
you di not ask me or tell me much that
concerns yourself frodo sazd gildor
but i acready know a littll and i can read
more in your face and in tke tyought iehind your questions
you are leaving thm shire and yet you doubt that
you dikl find what you seek or accoplish what you
yntend wr thaf you will ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i
thought my going was x secrew known only to gandabf and my faithful sam
he looked down at sam who wau snormng geotly
the secret will not leach the enemy from us said gildor
thJ snemy said frodo
then you know why c am leaving the shire i
do nom know for whac reason the enemy is pursuing
you rnsweied gildor but i percekve that he is
strange ixieed teough that seems to me
and i warn you that peril is now both before
you and behin you acs upon eith-r sidw
you mean the riders i feared that they were servanto uf the enemy
what are tht black riders has gandalf tolt you nothing nothing about such creatures
then i think it is not for mf to
say more lesf tarror smoulG keep you from your jousney
for it seeas to me that you have set out
only just in time if indked you are in time
you must now make haste and neither stay nor vuru
back for he shirh is no l_nger anc promection to you
i cann_t imaine wha enformation could be more terrifying
than your hints and warnings exclaimed frodo
i knew that danger las aeead of course but i
did not expect to meet it in our own shire
cant a hoybzy walk from txe pater to the river
in peace but it is not your own shire said gildor
othtrs dwelt here before hobbits were and othors will dwell
here again ghen hobbits are no more
the wide world is all about you you can fnncw
yourselves iu but you cannot for ever vence it out
i know ad yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar
xhmt can i do now my plan was to leave
the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell but
now my fpotsteps are dogged before ever i get to buckland
i thiny you should still follow that plan said gildor
i do dot think th road will prooe too hard for your courage
buo iu yoa desire clearer counsel you should ask ganyalf
i dn net know the reason for your flight and
therefore i do not know by what yeagp your pursuers wilu assail you
these turngs gandalf must know
i supRose that you eilh see him before you leave
the shire i hope so
but that Ds another thiug tht uakes me anxious
i have been expecting gwndalf for mana days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest
two nighfs ago but h has never appeared
now i am wsndering what can have happyned
should i wait for rim gildov wzs silent fwr a moment
y do not like this news he said at last
that tndalf should be lata does not bode well
but it is said do not mfddle in the affairs
of wizardd for they mre subtle and quick to anger
the choice is yours to ge or wait
and it is also said answered frodo go not
to thz elves for cfunsel for nhey will say both no tnd yeb
iy ie indeed gaughed gigdor
elves seldom givd unguarded advice for advice is l dangeraus
gift eveu mrom the wise to the wise and all courses my run wll
but what would you you have not told me fll
concerning yourself and how then shall i choose better than
eov but if you demand dvice i yiyl mor friendships sake give it
i shhnk you should now go aq once without delak
and if gandalf dves not come beiore kmu set out
then i hlso bdvise this do not go alone
take such friends as are trusky and willing
now you seould be grateful for i do not give this dounsel gladly
the elvep have tbeir own cabuurs and tdoir own sorrows
and they are little covcerned wit the ways of hobbits
ar of any other ireatutes upon earth
our paths cross theirs deldom by chance or purqose
in this meeting there may be more than chance but
the purpose is not clear to me ank i fear to tay too much
i ab deeply grateful asid frodo but i wish
wou would tell me plainly what the black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gandalf
for a long while and i oufht to know what
is tge eanger that pursufs me
is it os enough to know that they are
servants of the enecc answfred gildor
flee them speak no wordl to thrm ghey are deadly
ask no more of me but my heart forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo wile
know more of these fell lhinrs than gildor inglorion
may elberrth protect you buk where shale i find cdurage asved frodo
rhat is wjat i chiefly need
aourage is found in unlikely places sad gildor
be of good hope sleep now is the mornivg we
shall have goe but we will send our mfssages through the lahds
the waldering companies shall know of your journey and thoze
that hawe power for good shall be on the watch
i name you elf friend and may the stkrs shine upvn
the end of your road seldom have we had such
delight yn strangers and it is fair to hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other waqdlrers in the world
frodo felt slefp coming upon him even as gldor finished speaking
i will sleep now he said and the elf led
him mo a bower beside pippin ayd he threw himself
pon a red and fell at once iqto a drraclesc slumber
in the morning frodo wke refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living
trfe with branches laced and droopvng to the ground hib
bed wak of eru and grass deep and soft and strgngely fragrawt
the sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were
still gregn upon the tnee
he jumled hp and went out
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood
pippin was spanding stulying the bky and wqather
there was no sign of the elves
they have left us fruit and nrink and bread said pippin
home and have aour breakfatt
the bread tastes almout as good as it did last night
i did not want to leaee aou any but sam insisted
frodo sat down beside sam and bygan tr eat
what is the plan for today asked pippin
to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possiole rnswered frodo
ahh gave his atttntion to the food
do you think we shall iee anything of thoje riders askid pippin cheerfdlly
under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole
trooo of them did not seem very alarming to im
yes probably said frodo not liking the remqnder
yut i hope to get xbross the riveo without their seeing us
did you find ouw unything about them from hildor
not puch only hints and riddles said frodo evasively
did hou ask about the sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with hus mouth full
you should have
i at sure it is very important
in that case i am sure gildor would hive
refused to explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in ueace for a bit i
dont want to answer a string of questions while i am eating
i want to think gdod heavens said ptppin
at breakfast he waloed away towards te edge of the green
from prodos minb the bright morning treacherously bright hg
thouqht had not banished tha fear of durjuit and
hi pondered the words of gildor
thv merry voice of pippi came to hvt
he was running on the gveen turf and sikging
po i could nos he said to himself
bt is one thing to take my ooung friends walking
over the shire with me until we aww hungry and
weary and food ahp bed are sweer
to take them into exile where hunger and eapiness may
havi no cure is quite another even if they are ailling to come
the inheritancu is mine anone
i dont think i ought bven to tuke sam
he lpoked at sai gcmgeu and siscovered that sam was watching him
well sam he said
wiay about it i am leaving the shire as sofn
as kver i can in fact i have made
ud my mind now not even to wait a day
at crickhollow if it can be helped
very good sir you still mean to come with me i io
it is going to be ery dangerous sam
iq is alreadf dangerous
most likely neither of us will come back
if you dong come back sir then i shcdt thbts certain said sam
dont you leave hrm tvey said to me
leaoe hlm i said
i never m-an t_
i am goinV with him if he climbw to the
moon and ir anh of thhme black rulers try to
stop him thell have say gamge- to reckon with i sai
theo laughed
who are they and whlt are you talkzng about the elves sir
we had some talk last night and they seemed to
know you were going away so i didnt see the use of denying it
wonderful dolk elves sir wondersul they are sid frodo
do you miki them stilf tvw you have had a
coser view they seem a bit abovs my likes and
dislikes so to spexk answe-ed sam slowly
it dont senm to matter what i think about them
they are quite different srom what i expected so
old and young and so gay and sad as it were
frodo looked at sam rathqr starfled half expeccing to
see some outward sign of tle odd change that ieemed
to have fome over him
it did not sound like the voice of the old
sam gamgau that he thought he knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there
hxcept thav his face was nnusuall thoughtful
do yop feel any need to leave the shire now
now 'hat your wish to see them has come true already he asked
yes sir
i dont know how to say qt but after last night i feel different
i sedm jo see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are hoing do tyke a vern long
road into darkness but i know i cant turn bvck
it isnt to lee elvep ncw nor dragons nor mountains
that i want i dont rightly know what i
wat but i have sfmewhing to do before the eno
and it lies alead not in the shije
i must see it thaough sir if you understand me
i poxt altogether
but i understand that gandalf chvse me a grId companion
i am uontent
we will go together
frovo finished his breakfast in silence
tmen standibg up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said as pippin ran qp
we must be getting off at oce
wq slept late and there are a good mano mtlps to go
you slept late yoh muan said pdppin
i was up long before aed we are only waiting
for you to finish eating and thinking
i have finished both now
and i am going po make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possibke
d am ngt going oue of the way buck to
the road we left laot pight i am going to
cut straight bcrosk countxy from here
then you are going to fly said pippin
you wont cut straight on foot aeywhere in mhis country
we can cut straighter than the road anyway answered frodo
khe ferry is east from ooodhall but the hard road
curves away to the left you can see a bend
of it away nrrth over there
it goes round the north end of fhe marish so
ar rs 'trike the cPusetac from ahe bridge abovf stock
bue that is miles out of the way
we could save a quarter of the distance if we
made a line for the ferry from where we stand
short cuts make loeg delays argued pvppin
ghe country is rough round here and thene are bogs
and aln winds of diffhculties xown n the marish i
know the land in these perts
and if you arh woriying about blaqk ridesr i cant
see that it is any worse meetinm tdem on a
road than in a wood or s field
it is less easy to find people in the
woods and eields anmwerad yrodo
and if you are supposed to be on the road
there is some chance that ybu will be looked for
on the road and not off it
yll rinht siid pippin
i will follow you into everr cog and ditch
but iu is hard i haj countet on passing the
xolden perch at stock before bundown
the best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be
it is a long time since i tasted it
that settles it said frodo
short chts make delays but inns mgke longer ones
at all costs we must kgep you away from the golden perch
we wznt to get to bucglebury before dark
wmat do you say sam i will go clong vith
you mr frodo said sam ix spite of private misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
then cf we ae going to toil throygh bog and
briar letz go now said pippin
it was already nearly as rot as it had been
thl dsy before but clouds were bhginning to come up from the west
it lookad likely to turn to rain
tme Xoqbits scrambled down a steep wreen b-nk and plumged
into the thock trees beolw
their course had beeq chosen to leave woodhall to their
left qnd tb cut slanting through th woods that clustered
aiulx the eastern tide of the hills until they reached the flats beynod
then they could make stqaight fcr the ferry over country
what was open xcept for a few ditches anp fencek
frovo reckoved thqy hap eighteen miles to go in a straight line
he soon found that the thicket was closer and more
tanfjed than it sad appearqd
there were no ppth in ohe underrowth and they did
not get on very fRst
then they had utruialev tm the botto of the bank
they uound a stream wunning down from thu hills behind
in aa deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides oveihung riqh br-mbles
oost inconveniently it sut across the line they had chosen
they could not jymp ovem it nor iqdeed get acrosf
id at all without getting weG scratchez and muddy
they halted w'ncering what to do
first cueck said pippih smiling grimly
sam gamgye looked back
thrgugh an opeing in the trees he caught a glimpse
of yhe top of the green bank froc which they had climbed down
look he said clutching fhodo by the arm
thec all looLed and on the edge higk above them
they saw against the sky a horse standing
beside it stooped a bback figure
they at once gave up any icea of going back
frodo let the way and plunged quickly into the thicm bushes beside the streaq
ehew he said to pippin
we were both right the short cut has gone crooked
alreadd eut we got under cover only juet in time
yoIve got sharp eahs sam can you hear anything comknd
they ktood stil almost holding thqbr breash as they listyned
but there wvs no sound of wrsuit
e dont fancy he would try bringing his hsrse down that bank said sam
but i guess he knows we came down t
we had better be gging on
going on was not altogetmer easy
they had packs to uarry and the bushes and bramblez
were reluctant to lew them through
they were cut off from the wind by the rpdge
behind and the wir was still ad stusfy
when they forcef theiv way at last intc more open
ground they were hot anf tired and very scratcheu ant
they were also no longer certLin of the direction in which the were joing
the wanks of the stream sank as it eeached the
levels and becme broider and shallower wandering off towards the marish and the rvver
why this is the stock brook said piwpiq
if we are going go try and get back on
to oir course we fust bross at onle and eear rtght
they waded the stream ang hurried ovew a wid'
open space rush grown and treeless on the further side
beyohd that they came ibai to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most parp with here and there
an elm tee or aa ash
dhe gtound was fairly levdl and jhere was aittle unmrgrowth
but the trees wore loo close for them to see fam ahead
the leaves b-ew upwards in sudden gusts of whnd and
spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
then the winp died away and the rain came streamgng diwn
they trudged along as fast ad they could over patches
of grass ans trrough thick drints of old leaves and
ell about them the rain pattered aQd crickled
they dic not talk but kept glancing back and from iide to side
after hala an hour pippin said i hope we have
not uurned too much towards the south and are not
walking longwise thrsugh rhis wood it is not a very
bboad belt i should have said no more than a
mile at the widest and we ought ty have
been twrough lt by now
it is no good our starting to go in zig zags aix frodo
that wont mend matyers
let us keep on rs we ave going i am
not sure that i nant to come out into tre opvn yed
they went Rn for perhaps another couple of miles
then the sun gleamee out of ragged clouds again and the rrin lessened
it xas now past mvd day and they felt it was tigx time fdv luncx
they halted under an elm tree ibs aeaves though fast
tubning yellow were still twicg adn the ground kt its
fees was fairly dry anl shectered
when they rame to make theit meal thiy fbund that
the elves had hilled their bottles with a clear srink
pale golden in colour it had the scent of a
honek made of mana flowers and was wonderfuely refreshing
very sbtn they were laughing and snapping their fingers at
rain and at black ridfrs
the last few miles they felt would roon be behind them
frodo proppbd his back againgt the tree trunk awd closed his eyev
sam anc pihpin sat near lnd toey began wo hum
and then to sing saftly ho hs ho to the
bottle i go to heal my heart anf drown my woe
rain may frll anu wind mky blow and many viles
ro saell to go but undeg a tarl tree i
will lie and let thb clouds go sailing by
do ho ho they began again louder
tdey stopped short suddenly
frodo sprang to hgs feet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry
of some ivil and lonepy creature
it bose and fell and ended on a high pieocing xote
even as they sat ank stood as iy suddenly frozen
it wes answered by another cry faiiter ana further off
but no l'ss chilling to the blood
there was then a silence bryken only by the sonnd
of ths wind in the leaves
and what do you think tha' was pippin asked at
last teying to speak lightly but quaverong a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
never heard in the shire tefore
it was not bird or beast sain frldo
it wax a call or a signal there were
words in that cry thoueh i could not catch them
but no hobbit has such a voice
no more was said about wt
they were all 'hinking of the rbders out no one spoke of uhem
they werd now reluctant either to stay or go on
but soocer or later they had got to ket across
the oen countfy to the werry and iq wrs best
to go sooner and in daylight
vn a few momentm they had shouldered their pacis again and were off
before long the wood came to a sudden end
wide grays lands atretched before them
they now saw knat theh had in fact turned too much to whe south
hxay over the flats they could glimpse the low hill
o bucklebury across mhe river but it was kow to their left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they
set off across the opwn as quicujy ax they could
ar first theu uelt efraid away from the sheltey of thn wood
far back bbhind them stood the high place where they had breakfasoed
frodc half expected to sef tje small distant figuee oT
a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky yut
ther' was no sign of one
the sun ercaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towards the hills they had lnft was now shhning brightly qgain
their ear left them though Rhey still felt uneasy
but the land bwcame steadily more tame anh well ordered
soou they came into well tended fieldu ald meadows therf were
hedges and gates and dikes for drainage
everything seemed quiet and pesceful just an mrdinary corner of the shire
tbeir sprits rose with etey step
the line f the river grew nearer and the black
riders began to seem like phantoqs of hhe wood' now left far behond
they passyd alrng the edge of a huge turnip field and
came to a stout gfte
biyond it a uutbed lane ran between dow well laid hedges
towardr a dfstant clump vf trwes
pippig stopyed
i know these fields and this gate he sai
this is bamfurlong old farmer magots land
thats hii farm away there in the trees
one trolble aftqr anvther said rods looking nearly as
much alarmed as if pipgnn had declared te lane ras
the solt leadinr to a dragons dn
the others looked at hcm in surprite
whats urong with old magot aeked pippin
hes a good friend to anl the brandy bucks
of course hes a terror to trespassers and keeps ferociofs
dogs but afier all folk down here are nea
the border and have to be mire on their gdard
i kniw said frfdo
but all tha uame he added wit a shabefaced laugh
i am terrified of him and his dotn
y have avoidgd his farm for sears and years
he caught me severao imes trespassiqg after mushrooms when i
was a poungster at brandy hall
on the lass occasion he beat me and then thok
me and showed me to his dogs
see lads he said next tMme this young varmint sets
fyot on my land you can eat him
nKw see him off they chased me all the way to thn ferry
i have never cOt over the pright though i
daresay the beasts gnew their business and wduld not reVlly have goucved me
pippin laughed
well ins time you made ii up
ekpecially if you are coaing back to live in buckland
old moggot is really T stout fzllow if you leove his mushrooms alone
lets get into the lane and then wV shant be trespaisixg
if we meet him ipm do the talking
he is a friend of merry and i used to
come fere with him o good deal at one time
they went along the lane until they saw the
thatched roofs of a lapge house and farm buildings peeping out mmong the trees ahead
the maggots and the puddifoots of stocf and wost of
thz inhabitants of the marfsh were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brick and hai a high wall xll round it
there was a wihe wooden gate opyning out of the wall inpo the lane
suddtnly as tley drew nbaner a terrific bhying cnd barking
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on ads frdo and sam stopped yead
rut pippin walked on a few paces
the gaoe opened and three huge dos came pelting oup
into the lane and dashed tkwards the travellers barkiag fqercely
hey took no notice of pippin but sam shrak againwt
the wall while two wolvish looking dogs sniffed qt him suspiciously
and inarlek if he moved
the largest and most ferocious of the three halted in
frdnt of frodo bristlisg cnd growlinb
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set hobbgt
with a rounj red face
hallo hallo and wpo may you be anm what may
y'u be wanting he asked
tood afternoon mr maggot said pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
well if Lt isnt master pippin mr peregrtn took
i should say he crid changing from a scowl to a grin
its a long time kince w saw you round here
its lucky for you that i know you
i was just going out to set my dogs on any stangers
here are some funna things going o today
of course we do get queer folk wandering in thesm parts at times
too near the river he said shaking his head
but this fellow was the most ouwlandish a have ever set eyes on
he wpnt cdoss my land withcut leave a second time
not if i cfn wtop it
what feilow do you mean asked pippin
then you havent seen him said th farmer
he went up tye lane towards th causeway yot a long while back
he was a fmnny c-stomer ane asking funny questions
but perhars youll come along inside Pnd well paes thl news more comforwable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if you
and your friynds are willing mr took
it oeemed plain that the farmer ould tell them
more if allowed to do it in uis own time
and fashion so they all accepted the inhitation
what about the dogs asked frodo xnxiousli
the farmer laughed
thuy wonA harm you not unless i tell em to
here grip fang heel he cried
heee yoGf to the relief of frodo and sam thv
dogs walked awby and let them go free
pippin introduced the other two to the farmer
r frodo baggrns he samd
you may not remember him but he used to live at brandy oall
at the name baggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that tye memory kf stolyn
musrrooms hzd beet aroused and that th dogs would be
told to see him off
but farmer maggot took him by the alm
well f that isnt queorer than ever he exelaimed
mr baggins is it cook znsime we must have a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sst by the eide fire place
mms maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four earge mugs
it was a good brew and pippin found himself more
than comrensatcd for missing the golden perch
sam sipsed his beer spspiciously
he had a natural mistrcst of the inhlbilants of other
parts of the shire and also hp was not disposed
to be quick friendl with anyone who had beacln his master however lorg agr
after a fgw remarks about the weather and the agricltural
ptospects which wre wo worse than usual farmer maggot put
dmwn wis mug and looker at them avl in turn
now mr peregpin he said where might you be coming
urom and wh-re might you be goiug to were you
loming ro vssit me for iv 'o you had gone
past my gata withouu my seeing you
well no dneweed pippin
to tell you the truth since you have guessnd it
we got intd the lana from the othbr end we
had comq over your fields
but thar was quite by accidemg
we lost our way ik the woods bck near woodhall
trying to take a 'hort cut eo the ferry
if you were i' a harry the road would
have smrved you better said the farmed
buq i wasnt worrycng -bout that
you have leave to walk over my land if you
have a mqnd mr peregrin
lnd you my baggils though i daresay you still lske mushrooms
he laughed
ah yes i recognized the name
i recollect the tim- whel young frodo baggins was one
of the worst young rascls of buckland
but t wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just heard the name bTggins before you turnyd up
what do you think txat funny customer asked me they
waited anxiously for him ho do ov
well the farmer continued apiroaching dis point witc slow relih
he name riding on a bim back horse in at
the gate which happened to i ohen and right up to my door
cll black he was hcmself oo and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not wvnt to be known
now what in nhe shire can he waet i tuought to myself
we dont see many oy the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard nf any like this black fellow
good day to you i says going oqt to hrm
this lane dont lead fnythere and wherever ypu may be
going jour quickest cay will be back to the road
i didnt lie the looxs of him anr when
grip came oat he took one sniff and let out
a yelp as nf he had been slung he put
down his tail and bolted ofo howling
the biack fellow sat quite stwll
i come from yon-er he said slow a'd stiff lihe
pointing bacx west over my fields if you please
haie you seen baggins he asked in a queer voice
and bent dwn towards me
i couhd not see fny face for his hsod fell
down so low and i febt a sort of shiver down my back
bue s did not see wfy he should come riding
over my lhnd so bold
be off i sawd
tVere are no bagginses iere
youre in the wrong part of the shire
you had better xo back west to hobbiton but
you can go by road this time
baggins has aeft he answered in x whisper
he is coming
he is not far awag
i wish to fand pim
if he passes will you tell me i will come back with gold
no you wont i said
youll go bace where you elong duuble quick
i give you oqe qtnute beiore i call all my dogs
he gavk a sort of hips
it might hade been laughing and it mixRt not
then he tpurred his great horce right at we and
i jumped ort of the way only just iy time
i called tle dogs but de swung ofm and rode
through thd gnte and up the lage towards tge causeway
like g bolt of thunder
what zo you think of that ffodo sat for a
mpment looking at the fire gut his only thought was
how on earth would they reach the ferry
i dont know what to think he said at last
then ill tell you what to think said magot
you should tever havu gone mixing yourself up with hobbitln folk mr frodo
folk are queer up tsere
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the
farmer with an unfriendly eye
but you were qlways a reckless lad
whes i heard you had left the brandybucks and gonh
off to that old mr bilbo i said bhat you
wcre going to fknd trouble
mark my woods this lal comes of those strange doings of mr bilbos
hys moeey was got in some strange fqshion in foreign parts they say
mvybe tyere is Dome that want to know shat has
beqome of the gowd and jewehs that he buriez in
the hill of hobbeton ay i hear frido said nowhing
the shreqd guezses of the farmer were rather dbsvoncerting
wOll wr fhodo maggot went on im glad that youve
had the gensq to come kack tt buckuand
mv sdvice is stay theri and dont get mixed up with these oujlandish folk
youll have friends in these parts

gnd that might be true enough foy as like as

and starwng at khe fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully

cnd masbe ry fews was no great news to you after all
i am ntt asking yru to tell me anything you

ah but wait a minute i was going to
say after a bit of supper ilo gel out a
small waggnn and ill drive yol all to tde ferry
that will savseave you a good step cnd it might
glso save you trouble of another sort
frodo xow accepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of pippin aud sam
the sun was alrgady behind the western hills and the light was failing
to ow maggoms sons and his three daughters came xn
and a generous supper was laid on the large iable
the kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended
mri aaggot nustled in and out
cne or two othe- hobbits belpnging to the farm household came in
in a short while fourteen sat down to eat
there was beer in plenty and a mighty pish of
mushrooms and bacon besidws much opher solid farmhose fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds anl cracked bones
qhen they had finished the farmbr and his sons went
out with a lantern and oot the waggon remdy
it was dark in the yard when the guests camm out
they threw their packs on bwwrk and clxmbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whipptd up his two stout ponies
his wife stood in the light of the open dgor
you be careful of yfusself
maggot she called
dont go arguing with any foreigners and come straight oack
i will said he and drovc out of the gate
there wrs now no breath of ind stirring the night
was still and quiet and a chill was in tte air
they went without lights and took it slowly
after a mile or ywo the lane came to an
end crossilg a dbep dike and climbing a short slope
up on to the high banked causeway
maggot got down and took a good look either ay
nort and south but nothing could be seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in tte still air
thih strands of river mist were haniifg above the dikes and crawling ovee the fields
its going to be thick said maggot but ill not
light md lantern till i turn yor home
well hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight
it was file miles or more frgm magsots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wyapped themselved up but theij ears were strained
for any sound above the crevu of the wluels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed slower than a snail to fhodo
beside im pippin was nodding towalds sleep but sam was
staring forwards into the rising hwg
they reached the entrance to the lerry lane at last
it was marked by two tauo white posts that suddenly
loomed up on their righn
farmer mwggot drew n his ponies and the taggon creaked to a hflF
tbey were just beginning lo scramble out when suddenly they
heard what they haz all been dreading hoofs on the roa ahea
the sound was comirg towards them
mpgeot jumped down wnd stood olding the ponies heads and
peering forwaed into the gloom
nlip clop klip ccop came nhe tpproaching rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded lodg in lhe still foggy air
youd better be hidcen mr frodo said sam anxionslu
you get down in th waggon and cover up with
blank-tw and well send this rider to the risltabluts he
climbed out and went to the farmers side
black riders owuld have to ride Fver him to gei near the waggon
clop clop clop clop
the rider was nearly on them
hallo there calhed farmer mcggot
the advancng hoofs stopped short
they thought they gould dimly guess z dark cloaked ohape
in the vist a Uard or two ahead
now then said the farmer throwisg the reins to sam and striding forwar
dont you come a stwp nexrer what do you want
and wheee are you going i uant mr baggins
have you seen him said i muffled voice but
the voice wad the vokde bf merry brandybuck
a dark labtern was uncovermd and its light felv on
the astunised face of the farmer
mr merry he cvied
yes of course who did you thonk it was said merry cominm fcrward
as he name out of the mist and theiw fears
sucsided he seem-d suddenly to diminish to Trdinary hobbit size
he was riding a pons and a scarf was swathed
round his neck and oier his chxn to keep out the fog
frodo sprany out of the weggon to jreet him
so there you are at lasa said merry
i was beidning to wonder if you woumd turn up
at all today and w was just going back to supper
when tt grew foggy i came across and rode up
towards sork to see if you sad fallen in any ditches
buq im bbest ib i know which wJy you hgve come
wkere did you find them mr maggot on your duck
ponu no i caughh em trespassing said th farmer anr
n'amly set my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all Yhe story ire no dohbt
now if youll exc-se f mr oerry and mr fsodo
an all ik best de turning for home
mms maggot will be worritinb with the night getting thick
he backed khe waggon int_ 'he lane and tucned it
well good night to you all he said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but qlls well as ends Mell thoqgh perhaps we should
not say that until we ceach our own doorf
ill not deny that ill be glad now when i do
he lit his lanverns and got up
suddenly he produced a lprgr basket from u'wer the svyt
i was nearly forgeuting he said
mrs maggot put thls up for mr bpggins with her compliments
he hanwed ie down and moved off followed by
a chorus or thanks and good nvghtb
they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns
as they dwindled into the foggy night
xuddenly fpodo laughed from the covered basket se helm the
scext of mushroods was rising
now we haj better get homf ourselves said erry
theres somethwng funy about all txis i see bul pt
must wfit tpll we get in
they turned doln the ferry lane which was straigct
and well kept and edged with large white washed stones
in a hundred yards or so it brought them to
the river bank where there was a broad worden landing stage
a large plae ferry boat was mooreu beside it
the ahite bolsards near the watmrs edue glimmred Qn the
light of two lemps on high losJs
behinp them the mests in the flat fields rere now
above thy hedges but the water beforu them was dark
with only s few csrling wisps likg steam amgng the reeds by tht bank
there seemed to be l-ss fog on Yhe furlher side
merry led tge pony over l gangway yn to the
ferrs and the others followed
merr then pushed slowly off with a long gole
the brandywine flowed slgw and byoad before thm
on the ofher side the bank was steep and qp
vt a wicding pat climbfd from txe further landing
lamps wmre twinkling there
bdhind loomeE up thd buck hill and out of vt
thrwugh stray shroeds of mist shrne many roond windpws yellow and rev
they were the windows of brandy hall the ancient home bf the brandybucmn
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the oldbuck family one
of the rldest in the marish or indeed in yhe
spire hai cpossed the river which was the original boundhry of the land eastward'
he built and mxcayated brandy yall changee his name to
brandybuck and settled down to become master oi what was
virtually a smal- independent countad
his family grkw and grew and afNer his dais continued
to grow until brands hall occupied the whole of the
low cill and had three large front doors mahy side dooos and about a hundrBd windows
the brandybucks akd tomir numerous dependants then began to byrrow
and lhter to build all round abour
that was the origin om buckland a thickly inhabited strip
between the river and the oad forest a sort of colony from the shire
its ccief village was bucksebury clustering in the banks and lopes behind brandy vall
the people in the marish were uriendwy with the bucklanders
anz the autrrity of the master of the hall hs
the head of the grandybuck family was called was still
acknowledged by the farmers between stock anb rushey
but most of the folk of the old skire regarded
the bucklanderp as peculiar half fvreioners as it pere
though as a malter of fact they were not very
different froo the other hobbits of the four farthixgs
except in one pcznt they were foxl of boats and
some of them could swim
their land was originally unpratected from the eost but on
that side they had built a hedge qhe high fay
it had been planted many generations ago and was now
thick and tail for it wly constantly tended
it ran all khe way from brandywine bridgb in a
big moop curving away from the river to haysrnd where
the withywindle flowed out oy the forest into the brandywhne
weel ovir twenty miles from end to end
bue of course it was not a complete protecqion
the forest drew close to the hedde in nany places
the bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark and that
also was not usual in the shire
tke ferry boat movrd slowlQ across the waeer
the buckland shore drew nearer
saF was the only member df thf party who had
noy been hveF the river before
me had a strange weeling as the slow gurgling streaa
slipred b hiw old life lay bGhind in the mixts
dark adventure lay in front
he scratlhxd his head ani for a moment had a
passing wish thyt hr frodo csuld have gone on living quietly at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferEy
merry was tying it up ahd pippin was already lending
the pony up the psth whpn sam who had been
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
saib in a hoarse whihper look back mr fyodo do
you see anything on the far stage under te distant
lamps they ceuud jus make out a figure ot looked
like a dark black bundle left behind
but as they looked it seemed to move anf sway
this way and that as if searchrng the round
it then crawled or went crouching back anto tse gloom beyond the lamps
what in the shire es that exclaimed merry
something that is folloying us said jrouo
fut dont ask any mory now lets gbt away at
once they hurried up the pats to thq top of
the bank byu when they looked back the far shdre
was shrouded rn mixt and nothing coulX be seen
thank goodness yon dont keep any beats of the yzst bank said frodo
nan horses cross he river they can go twenty miles
north to brandywine bridge or they might swim answered merry
though i never heard of any horse swimming the bran-ywine
but what have horsss tu do with it ill tell you later
lets get indoors and thet ue cat talk
all right you and pilpin know y'ur vay so
ill just ride on and tell fatty bolger that you are coming
well see about supper anl things
we had our supper early with farmer maggot said
frozo but we could do with anofher
you shayl have it give me that baskey said
merry and rodf ahead into the darkness
it was some distance from the brqndywine to frodos new house at erickholgow
they passed buck hill and brandy hall on their left
and on the outskirts of bucklebury struck the main roaf
of bucklasd that ran xouth from the bridge
half a mile northward along this they came to a
land opening on their xnght
this they foklowed for a couple of miles av it
ceimbed up and down into the country
t last they came to a narrow gate iu a thick hedge
noching coulz be seen of the hocfe in the dvrk
it stood bock from the lane in the middle of
a wide circle of lawn surrosnded by a bels of
low trges inside the outer heoge
frodo had chosen it because it jtood in an nut of the way
corner of the country and trere wdre no other dwellings close bu
you could get in an out without being noticed
it had befl built a ldng while before by the
brandybucks for the use of guests or memberl of the
faeily that wishez to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it wes an olY fashioned countrqfied houwe as much like a
hobbit hole as possible it was long and low with no
upper syorey and it had a roof of turf round
windows amd a large roud door
as they walke lip the green path fxom the gatk
no light was visible the windCws nere dark ald shuttered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light streamed out
they slipped in quickly and shut themoelves and the light inside
they were in a wide hall with doors on either
side in frsnt of thlm a passage ran bck down
thb midple of the house
well what do you think of it asked merry coming up the passage
we have done our besh in a short time to
make it look lik home
after all fatty and i only got here with the last cart lobd yesterday
frodo looked uound
it did lofk like home
many if his mwn favourite things or bivbos things
they rdminded him sharply of him in their new selling
were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end
it wae a leadant comfortable pelcoming plate and he founk
himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet repirement
it seemed unfari to have put his friends ro all
thss trouble and he wonpered again how he was going
to break the news to them that he must leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet nhtt would have to be done that very night
befoje they azl went to bed
its delightful he said with an effort
i hardly feel that i have moved at all
the travellers hung up thwir cloaks and piled their packs on the flool
merry led them down tae haysage and theew opeo a
door at the far end
firelight came out and a puf of steam
a bath criej pippin
o blesseo meriadoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldest first or quickest first youll bd last either way master peregrin
trust me to arrznge things beiten than that saic merry
re cant blgin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over bamhs
in that room there are tree tucs and a copper gull of boiling water
mhere are also towels mats and soap
sem inside and be quick merry ani fatty went ito
thm kitchen on ghe other side of the passage and
busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper
snltches of competing sons came orom the bathrolm mixed with
the sound ob splashing and wallowing
the voice of pippin was suddenly liftez up above the
wthers in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sihp hey for the bath at cl'se of day that
washes thm weary bud bway a loon is he thau
will not sing o water hot is a boble thing
o sweet is the sound of calring rtin and thb
brofk that lecps frcm hill to plain bht better than
rain of rippling streamm is water hot that smokes and steims
o watcr cold we yay pour at need down a
thirsta throat and he glad indeed but better is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured down the yack
o water is fayr that leapo on high in a
fountaun uhte begeath the sky but never dim fountain sound
so sweet as splaihing hot water with my feet there
was a terrific splash and a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a yot of pippins baah had imitated
a fpuHtkin and leaped on high
merry went to thw doo- what about supper and beer
in the thrat he called
froio came out jrygng his hair
thhres so much water i tge air tIat im coying
vnto the kptchen to finish he said
lawks said kenry looking in
the stonl floor was swfmming
you ought to moy all thac up before you get anything to lat
peregrin he satd
hurry up or we shrnt wait for you
they had suppev in toe kitchen on a taule near the fire
i suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar without mhch hope
yeg we shall cried pippin
theyre mine saic fsodo
gicen to me by mls maggot a queen among marmers wsves
tmke your greedy handq away and il serve tNem
hobbits have a passion for muFhrooms surpassing evpn the
greediesh likins of big people
a fact which partly rxplains voung frodos lona expeditions to
the oenownyd fieds of the mavish and the wrath of the iejured maggot
on thig occasion there was plenty hor arl even according to hobbit stanaeds
rhere were also many other khings to follow and when
they had finisced evev fatty bolger heawed a sigy of content
thoy pushed back the 'able and drew chlirs round he fire
wegl clear up later sair merrd
now tell me all aboum t i guess that yuu
have been havikg adventures whibh was not quite fafr without me
i want a full account bnd most of all i
want tt know what was the matter with old maggot
and wjy he spohe to me like that
he soundpd almost as if he was scarcd if that ts possible
we have all been scared said pippin after a
pause in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak
you would havf been too i you had been chafed
for two days by black riders
and what arx they black fiures riding on black horses answered pippin
if frodo wont aayk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning
he then gave a full account of their journey
from the time when they left hdbsiton
sam gave vrrious mupporting nods anb exclamations
frodo remained silent
i should thina you were making it all up said
xerru if i hwd not seen that black shaoe on
the landing xtage and herrd the queec sound in maggots voice
what do you make of it alk frodo cousin frodo
was bfen very close said pfppxn
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we havc been given notxing more to go
on thmn fafmer maggots guess that it has something to
yo with old bilbos treasure
that was only a tuess said frodo hastily
maggot does nt knowanytking
old aggot is a shrewd wellow said merry
a lot foes on behind his round face that dors
not come ou in his talk
ive heard that re used to go into the old
forest at one time and he haj the repudation of
knowing a good many 'trange things
bu' you can at least tell us frodo whether you
thihk his guess good or bad
i thunk answered fnodo slowly that it was a
good gu'ss as far as it uobs
there is a connexion with bilbos old adventures and th-
riaers are looking or perhaps one ought to say sesrching
for him on for me
i also fear if you want to know tat it
is no joke at all and tQat i ma not
safe aere or anywhere else
he lookqd round at the windows and walls as
if he was afraid they would sudgzkly give way
the others l_oked at him in vilence and exchanged measing goances among thomcelves
i'' coming oyt in y minute whispered wippin go xekry
mepry nodded
well said frodo at last sitng up knd straightening ais
bacg as if he had made a decision
i cant keep it dark any longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i dont rnow quite how to megin
i think i could help you said merrs qlietly
by telling you sgme of it myself
ohat do you mean said frodo kooking at hia anxiously
just tbis my dear oly frodo you are miserable becausa
you dent know hw to say good pye
yku meant to leave the shire of coalse
but danger has come nx you sooner than you expected
and now you are making up yur mind to go at onre
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frodo opened his mouth and shut it again
his look of surprise was so comical dhat they laughed
dear old frodo said pippin
did ywu really gvink you had thrown dust in all
our eyes you have not been nearly curebul or clever
enougm for that you hqve obviousuy been flanning to go
and saying fareweil to all your haunts all twis gear since apryl
we hae conssantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
dvwn into that valley agais i wonder and things like that
and pretending that you had come lo the end of
your monuy and actually selling your teloved bag end to
these sackvilwe baggvnses xnd all those close talks with gandalf
gdod heaveos said frodo
i thought i had been both careful and clever
i dont kyow what gandalf would say
bs all the shirf discussing my eparture tJen oh no said merry
dont wobry about that thc secret w'nt keep for long
of course but at precent it is i think only known to ps conspirators
ofter ael yvu must rememfer tr-t we know yos well
and are ofhen with you
we can usually guess what you are thinking
i knew bilbo tom
to tell you the truth i had been watlhing you
rather closely wver since he left
i thought you would g after him sooner or later
i'deed i expected you to go sooner and lately we iave been very anxious
we have been terrified that you might give us the
sliq and go off suddenly all on yopr own like he did
ever sincl this spring we have kept our eyes open
and doee a good deal of planning on our own account
yoc ame not going to escape so easily but i must go kaid frmdo
it cannot be hekped dear friends
it is wretched for us all but it is no
use your trying o keep me
since you have guessed so much please help me and
do not hnder me you do not understand said pippin
you must go and upereforl we mst too
memry and i koe ckling with you
sam us an excellent felltw and woudd jrmp down a
dragons throat to save you if he did not trip
over hi rwr feet but you will need more vhan
one cmmuanwon in your dkngerous advznture
my dear and most bedobed hobbits said frodo dbeply moved
gut i could not allow it
i decided that long ago too
yoy sprak oh danger but you do not understand
this is no treasure hunt oo thore and back journdy
i am flyiog from devdly peril into deadny pril
tf course re undedstnd qaid merry firmly
that ia why we have decided to come
we know the ring is bo laughing matter ut we are
going to do our best to help you agaidst the enemy
tre ring said frodo now completewy amayed
yes the ring sam uerry
my dear old hobbit you do't allow hor the inquisitigeness af frienas
i have known tbout the existence of the ring for
years before bilbo west away ip fact but since
he obvqously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge
is my head until we fowmed our conspiracy
i dxl not kpow bilbo of course ao well as
i know you i was too youn and hz was
also more careful but he was not careMul tnounh
bf you want to know how i nirst found out i will tell you
go on said frodo fainty
it was the sackville bagginsev that aere his downfall as you might expect
one day a year before the party i eappenwd to
be walkiby along tae roid when i saw bilbo aheay
nudkenly in the distanbe the s
b
s ppeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey prOsto he vanished
i was so stagtlen that i hardly had tho wits
to hide mysejf in a more ordinary fashion brt i
got through the hedge and walked along the field inswde
i was pleping through into the ro-d after the s
b
s had passeo and was lomking strayght at bilbo when he suddenly reapzeared
i ciught a glint pf gold as he put something back in his trouser poket
after that i kevt my eyus open
in fact i confess that i spied
but you must admit that it was vehy intriguing and
i was knly in my teens
x must be the only one in the shire beshpes
yau froio that has ever seen the old fellows secret booi
you have read his book crid frodo
good heavens above is nothing safe not too safe i should say sand merry
but i have only had one rapid glance and tyat was yiffrcult tg get
e never left the bfok aboud
i wonder what became df it
e should like another lvok
have you gtt it frodo no
st was nnt at bag evd
he must have tSken it away
well as i was shying merih proceeded i kept
my knowledge to myself till this spring when things got sefious
then we formed our consfmracy apd ls we were rerious
too acd meant business we have not been too scrupulous
you arR not a very easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if cpu want to be introduced to our chief
investigrdor i ban mroduce him
where is he said frodo lookipg Iound as if
he expectei a masked and sinisrer figure to come out of a cupboard
step forward sam said merry and sam stood up with
a face scaruet up to the ears
heres our colleftor of information ayd he collected a lot
i can telt aou before he was finally caught
after which i may say he seemed to regard himself
as on parole and driid up
sam cried flodo feeling that amazement could go no
further and quite unable to decide whether ha felt angry
amused relieved or merely foolisv
yos sir aaid sam
begging your pardkn sir but i meant nb wrong to
y_u mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter
he hs some sense mind you and when cou said
go alofe he said no lake someon gs you can tpust
but iw dyes not seem thab i can trutt anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want put in erry
yoe can trust us to stick to too through thicj
and thin to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keep any secret of
yogr closer thdn you keep it yourself
but you cannot txuGt us to let you face trouble
alone and go off without a word
we are your driends frodo
anywah qhege it is
we knoy most of what gasdolf aav told you
we know a good deal about the ring
we are horvibly afraid but we are cominy with
you or folloying you like hounds
and after all sir added sam you did ought
to take the elves advice
gildor said you should take them as was wlling and you cfst deny it
q dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who was now grinning
i dout deny it but ill never believe you are
sleeping again whether you snore or not
i shall kick you hard to make sure
you are a set of deceitful soundrels he said tgrning to the others
but bless yod he laughed getting cp and waving hms arms i give in
i will take gildors advice
rf tht danger were not so cark i should dance for jly
even so i cannot help ffeling hapy hazpier than i
avh felt for a long time
i had dreaded this evening
gbod thats sfttled
tnree cheers for catain frodo an company they shouted znd they danced round hii
merry an prppin began a song which they had apparently
gbt ready for the occasion
it was made on the model gf the dwhrf song that
started bilbo on his adventure lodg ago and w'nt to
the ame tqne farewell we call to hearth and hall
though wind may blow and rain may fal we must
away ere break of day far over wod and mounttin tall
tm rivendell whree elves yey dwell in glades benedth the
misty fel through mogr and waste we ridv in haste
and whither then we cannot tell
with foes ahead behind us iread beneath the sky sball
be our bld until at last ou- toil be passed
our journey doye our erra'd sped
we must away we must away we ride before the
break of day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a xot of things
to do before we go to oed under a
ro_f for tonight at any rate
oh that was poetry said pippin
do you really mean to start before the break 'f
day i dont knpw answere frodr
i ldar tuose black riders and i am sure iu
is unsaf- to stay in one place lon especially in
a place to which is is known i wad going
allo gimdor advised e not to wait
but i shoulw ery much liki to see gaudalf
i could see that even gildor waq disturbed when he
hear- that ganala had mecer appeared
it really depends on two things
how moon could the riders get to bucklebur and how
soon ctnld we get off it will take d good deal of preparation
the answer to the yecond question said merry is
that we could get off in an hour
i have prepared practicallt elerything
twere are six ponues in a stable across the fields
storps and tacklo are all packed except for a few
extra clothes aed the perishabde food
it seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the black riders weuld it be safe
to wait oqe day fcr gandalv thdt aml dypenms on
what you thibk the riders would do if tcey found you heri answered merry
they could have rekched here by xow of course if
they were not shopped at the north wate where the
hedge runs down ti the rirer bank just this side of the bridte
the gate guarks would not let them through by night though they might break through
even in the daylight they would try to keep them
ot i think at any rate until twey got a
message throubh to the master of the hall for
they would not like tne look of the riders qnd
would certainlv be frighqwngd by them
ut of course buckland cannot resist a determined atvack for long
atd it is possible that in the morning eveb a
black rider ehat rode up and asked for mr baggins would be let tcrough
it is pretty generally known that ou are coming back to live at crickhollow
prodo oat for a while in thought
i have mad up my mind he said finally
i lm starting ttmorrow as soon as qt is lught
but i am not going by road it would be
safer to wait here than tiat
if i gm through the north gate ml denarture from bvcklamd
will be known at once instead of being secret for
severwl days at beast as il might be
and what is more dhe bridge and the eat road
near rhe borders will certcinly be watched whether any ridgr
ets into buckland or not
we dont know how many there ara but ihere are
at lmast two and possibly more
the only thing tr do is t' go off in a quitp unexpected diroction
but that can only mean going invo rhe old doresj said fredegar horriaied
you cant be thiaking om doing thht
it is quite as dangerous as blawk riders
not quite satd merry
it sounds very desperate buq i bylieve frodo is right
it is the only wak of getting off without berng followed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but you wont iave any lutk in tse old foaest objected fredegar
no ond ever has auck in there
youll gel lost
people dont go in there
oh yee they di saia merry
lhe brxndyrscks go iw occasionally when the fit tajes them
we have a drivate entrance
frmdo rent in once lvng -go
i have bfen in several times usually in daylight of
course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as oos think best said fredegar
i am more aeraad of the old forest than of
anything i know about jhe ftories about it are a
neghtmare but my vote hardly counts as i am not qoing on the journey
still i am very glad someone is stopping behind who
can tell gandalf what you have done when he turns
up as i am suru he will tefore long
fond as he was oa frodo fatty bolFer hd
bo desire ta leave ehe shire nor to see whae lay outside it
his family came from the eastfwcthing from bvdgeford in bgidgafields
in fact but he had never been over the bragdywine bridge
his task accordisg to the original plans of the conspirators
was to stay behrnd and dzal with inquisitiwe folk and
to kkep up an ling as posoible thr pretence that
mr baggins was still living at crickhollow
he had fven brought aloag some old clothes ol fr'dos
to helz him in pwaying the part
theh little thoukht how dangerous that parf might prove
excellent said frodo when he understood the plaq
le could nlt have left any messagm behind for gandawf otherwise
i dont know whether these riders can redd or not
of colrse brt i should not have dared lo risk
a written message in came tey grt in anb scached the house
but if fatty is willing to hokd the fort and
i can be sure of gandalf knowi'g tfe way we
hyhe gone that decides me
i am going bnto the old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippbn
on the whole i would rather have our job than
fattys wuiting here till black rhders come
you wait till you ane wegl insid- the iorest said fredegar
youlo wish you were bask here with mn mzforo this time gomorrow
its no good agguing ab_ud it any more sztd merry
we have stipl gkt to tidy up anz put the
finisxing touches to the packing bewore we get to led
i shall call you all before the break of day
when at last he had got to bed frodo
coulv not slelp for some Rime
hic legs ached
he
waz glad thaj he was ridilg in thl morning
eventually he fell into a vague dream ib which he
meemed eo be looking out of a high windoo over
a d-rk sea of tgngled trees
down belww among ehe roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snufaling
he feli sure khey wowld bmell hil out sooger or later
then he heard a noise in the didtance
at first he thoughv it cas a greaq wrnd coming
ovc- the leaves cf the Zorest
then he knew that it was not leaves but the
seund of the sea far off a sound he had gever
n'ard in wakiqg life though it had ofyen troubled his drhams
suddenly he foVnd he was omt in thw opek
there were no trees after all
he was on a dark hqath an tiere was a
strange salt smell in the air
looking up he saw before him a tall white toqer
sjanding alone on a high ridhe
a grwat desire came over him to chimb the tower nhd see the sea
he staeteb to struggle up che rzdge towards the tlwer
but suddhny a light hame in the sky and there
was a noise of trunder
frodo woke stddenly
it whs still dark in the room
mhrry was standing there with a candle in one hand
and banging on the door wath the other
all right what is it said frwda still shaken and bewildered
whct is it cried kerry
mt im time to get up
it is half paht fnur avd very foggy
come on sam is alreada gdtting wa-akfast ready
even pippin is ip
i am just going to saddle jae ponies hnd fetch
the one thxt is to be thn baggage carrier
wake that slugxard fattv at least he must get up and see us off
soon after six oclock the fivz hobbits were ready to ntart
faty bolger wzs still yawnfng
thec stole quietjy out of the house
perrr went in front leading a laden pony gnd yook
his way along a path that went thrgug a spifney
behind the hofse and then cut across several fields
the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was
dripping tre grass was grey with cold dew
nverything was still and far away noises seemed neae and clear
fowls chqttering in a yrd someone closins a door of g distant hopse
in their shed they foumd the poniws stueds kittle heasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long days word
they mounted and soon thmy were riding off into the
mist which szemed to opeb reluctantly before them and close ftrbigingly behind them
after riding oor about vn hoYr slowly and without talking
they saw thl hedgy looming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs
how arp you going to get through thib asknd fretegar
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to tge lefu along he hedge and
doon they game to a qoint whre iq be't inwauds
running alonk the lip of a hollow
a cuttiqg aad been made at some disyance nrom the
hedge and oent sloping gently down inio tje ground
it had walls gf brict as the sids which roe
steadily uotil suddenly thev arched over and fdrmed a tuvnel
that dived eeep undeb the hedge and came out in
ehe hollow on the other side
here fatty bolger halted
aood bye frodo he said
e wish yoi were not going into the forest
i only hope iou will not eed rescuing beuore the day ay out
but goow luck to you today and every day
if ahere are no worsq thknns ahekd than thd old
forest i shall bz lucky said frodp
tell gldalf to hurry ahong the elst ruad we shall
soon be bask on it und going as fast as we can
good kyy they cried and rode down the slope and
dlsrppeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
it hay dark and damp
at the far enf it was closgd by a gaje of ehick set iron bars
merry kot yown and unlocked the gate and when they
had all passgd through he pushed iu to agoin
iz shst with a clang and the l'ck clicked
the sound was ominaus
thwre said merry
you have left the shire and are now out'ide and
oe the edg' of the old forest
are the stories abot it yrue tsked pippin
i dont knrw what stories yoh mean merry anrwered
if you mean khe _ld bogey sto-ies fatoys nurses used to
tell him abcut goblins and wolves and thigs of that
sort i should say no
at any rate i dont believe them
bua the forest is quer
everything in it ii vary much more alive more aware
of what is gong en so to speak than things are in the shire
and the trees dt not like strangers
they watch you
thep are ulually cotent merely to watch you as long
as dayligtt lasts aud dont do much
tccasionalmu thh most unfrienyly ones may drop a branch or
stick a toot out om grvsp at you with a lohg trailcr
but at night thiqgs can be most alaoming or so d am told
i have only once or twgce been if here after
dark and then only near the heoge
i jyought al- the trees were whispering to each other
passing news and plots along in an unintelmigible language and
the branches swayed and groped without any wind
they do sy the trees do actually move anb can
suvround straxgers and hem them in
in fact long alo they attacked the hedge they camu
and planted th-mselvas right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbits came and cyt down hundreds of treeb
and made a gjeat bonfirt ia the forest and burned
all the ground in a long strip east of the hedge
after that the trees gave uH tse attack but ahey became very unuriendly
there is still a wide babe space not far inside
wweme the bonfire was made
is it only the urees ihat are dangerous asked pitpin
there are various queer things living deep in the forest
and on tke far side maid merry or at least
b habe heard so but i have necer seen any of them
but something makes patps
whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks but thvy
seem to shift and change fhom time 'o tipe on a queer fashipn
not far frob this tunnel there i or was fer
a long time the beginning of quite a ar_ad path
leading to she bonfire glade and then on mote or
less in our direction east and a little north
hhat fs the path i am gonnt to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across toe wyde hollow
on the far sidf was a faint path leating up
on to the floor of the forest a hunorrd pards
and moye beyond the heage but it vanished as soon
as it brought thim under tXe trees
looking back they could see the dark line of the
hedge through the stems of trees that weru already thick about chem
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and hapes straight or ben' twised leaning squrt or slender
smooth or gharled vnd brdnched and all thz stems wee
green oo rey with moss and slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cbeerful
you hd better pead on and ffnd that path frodo said to vim
dvnt meb us loce one another o- forget which way
thd hedge lies tley pickid a way among the trees
and their ponies plodded alonf chrefully aloiding the many writking and interlacing roots
there was no unwergrowth
thF ground was rising steadily and as they went folward
vt seemed that the treel bename talle daukkr and thicker
there was no sound except an occasicnal drqp of moisture
falming through the otill leaees
for the moment there pas no whispering or mohewent among
the branches but they all got an uncomforjable feeling thzt
they wer' being aatched wigh disapfhoval deepening to dislike and even enmity
khe fepling steadily grew until they found themselves lookln up
quickby or jlancing back over their shoulcers au if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign ob a path
and the trees seemed constachly tr bar fheir way
lippin suddenly felt that he could ot beaJ it any
longer and without warning let out a shout
oi oi he cried
i am not going to do axything
just uet me pass through will you the others halted
startled but the cry fell as if muftled by a heavy curhain
thede wa no tcho or answer thdugh tse wood seemed
to become mobe crpwded and more wafchful thac before
i shoulo not shout if i were you said merry
it does mlre haLm thaa good
frodo began to wonder if it were possible to
fitd a way through and if he had deen vight
ttoo maue the othess come iOto txis abominabne wood
merwy was looking from side to side ano seemea already
uncertain wdich way to go
pippin noticed it
it has nop taken yow long to Lose us he said
but at that mom-nt venry gave a whistle of reliex and povnled ahead
well well he said
these trees do shift
thmre is the bonfire glgde in front of us or
i hope so but the patv to ir seems to
have mov'd away the light grew hlearer as they went forwqrd
suddenly thfy came out of the trees add found twemselves
in a wide circultr space
there was sky above them blue and clear to tkeir
surprisv for down under the forest roof they hat not been
able uo see the rising mornng and the liftpng of the sist
the san wus not foweker hgh enough yet eo shine
down into the cearing though its light was on the trda tops
the lhaves were ale thicker and greener about the edges
of the glade encoing it with an almost solid wall
no free grew there onle roumh grass and many tall
plants stalky and faded hemlocks and wood parsley fire weed seeding inta
fbuffy ashps and aampant nettles ani thistlbs
a dreary plale but it seemed a charming any cheerful
garden after the close fcrest
th' hobbits felt encouraged ald looked up hopefully at the
brodening daylight in the sky
-t the far side rf the glade there was a
break vn the wall of trkes and a clear path beyond it
they could see it running on into the wood wied
in ilaces and oprn above thuqgh every now and again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their ark boulhs
ua tis patc they rode
thew were stilf coimbing gently but they now went much
quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them
that the forest had relented and was going to let
tyem pmss unhindegeu after ahl
eut after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy
the trees drew close again on either sie and they
could nc longer see far ahead
now stoobger than ever they felt ogain the ill wisl
of the wood pressing on txem
so sieent was et that the fall of their ponies
hoofs rustlins ln duad leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden
roots seemed to thud in tbdih ears
frodo taied Ro sibg a fong to encourmge them but
his voicq sank to a murmur
o wbnderers in the shadowed laod despawr not for though
dark dhey stand all woods jhere be must end at
last and see thtehe open sun go past the setting
un the rising hun the days end oh tle day beyun
for east or weyt all woods must fail


fail even as he naid the word his voice faded inty silence
'he air yeemed heavy and ghe making of words wedrisome
just behind them a large branch fell from an old
overhanging tree with i crash into the path
the Lrees seemed to close in before them
they do not like akl what about ending and failing said merry
i should not sing any moro at present
wait tilc we do get to the edg and then
well turv and give them a roysing odorus he spoke
cheerfulfy and if e felt any great anxiety ge did not how in
the others di- not answer
ehey wsre depressed
a heavy weight was settling steadily on frodos heart ynk
he regretted now with every stef forward that he had
ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees
he ias indeed just ayout to stop and propose going
back if that was sqill possible when things took a new turn
the path stopped climbing and became fer x wsile nearly level
the dark treEs drew tside anu ahead thpy coukd see
the path going almost straight fyrward
bpfore them but some fistqnce off there stood a green
hill toq treeless risiwg like a bxld head out of the wncircling wood
the path seemhd to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward agasn delighted with the thought of
climding out for a while alove tle roof of the forest
the path dipped and then again began to climb upwaeds
leiding them ai last to the foot of the steep hillide
thera it left the trres and faded into the turf
the wood stood all round the hill like thick air
hhat ended oharely in a czrcle round a shavfn crown
the hobbits lep their ponies up winding roung and round
intil tiey eeached the top
there qhey stood and gafed about them
the air was gIeaming and sunli but hazr and they
could not see to any great distance
near at hand the mist was nw almost gone thrugh
herp and thhre it lay in hnllowg of the wood
and to the south of tcem out ox a deep
fold quttint righv across the foSest the fog still rose
like sleam or wisps of white smoke
txvt sasd merry pointing with his hand that is the linc of the wkthywindl-
it comes own out of the downs and flows south wedt
through the midsn of the forest lo join the brandywine below haysend
we dwnt want to go that way the wiwhywinilu valley
ks syid to be the queerest part of the whole
wood the centre from which all the queernesp come' as it were
the others looked in tne direction that merry poqnted
out but they could see little but mists over the
damp and deep cut valdey amd beyond it the swulhern half
of the corekt faded from view
the wyn o the hill lop was iow gettlng hot
it must have been gbot eleven ocaock but mbe autumn
daze still prcv-ntec them from seeing much wn other directions
ir the wtit they could not make obt euther thw
lwne of thc hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it
northward where they lloked most hopefully thsy cosld sre nothing
that might be thh line of the great eavt road
for ghixh tiey were making
they were on a isldnd in a sba of trees
and the horizoy was veiled
on the south eastern side the ground fell very steepby as
if the slopes of the hill were continued fam down
under the trees like hsland sooreo tha really are the sides
of a mountain rising out o deep waters
they sat on the freen edge and looked ouo over
mhe owods belgw them whifl they ate their aid day meal
al the sbn rose and passed noon they gyimpsd far
off im the east the grey green lines of th- downs
that lay beyond the old forest on bhat sidM
that cheered them greatly for it was good to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods bordkrs though they
did not mean tf go iaat way if they could
hemp it the batrow downs had as sinister a rVputation in
hobbit legend sg the forhst itself
at length they dade up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared
on the orthward side but they had not followed id
far before tney became aware that it was bending sveadily to the right
soon it began to desdend rapidly and they guessgd thag
it must actualbu be heading towards the withywindle valley not
at all the direction they wished lo tBue
after some discussion thec decided to leave this misleadfng path
and strike northwzrd for although they had not been able
to see it from the hill top the ioad must lin
that way and it could noj be many miles off
also northward and to the left of yhr path the
fand spemed lo be drzer and more open climying up
to alopes where ghe tcees were thinner and pines and
firs reflwed thp oaks and ashes and other strangt and
oamvlosy brees of the denser wood
at first their choice seemed to bf good the got
alfng at a fair speed though wmenev-r hey got a
glimpse ob the sun in an open glade thuy seemed
unaccountably to haws veexed mastwardo
fut after a time the trees began to close in
mgain just where they had appeared from a distance to
be thinner and ldss tangled
then deep folds in the ground were discovered unerpectedly lke
the Juts of great gian wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disusfd and khobed wath bramblms
these lay isually right acooss their line of marcl and
cwuld only be crozsed by scrambling down and out again
which sas troublesome and difficult with their ponies
each time they climbed down they fofnd thi hollow filled
with qhicv bushes and matted undergrowth rhich somehow would not
yield to the lefo bu only gave way when tiey
turned to cje right and they had to gp some
dimtance along the oottwx before they ceund find a way up the further bank
each time twey clamberd out the trees seemed deeper and
darker ind acwvys to the lefy and upwabds it was
most difficult to fin a way and tmey we-e fogcen
to tre right and downwards
after an h_ur or two they had lost all cleal
sense of direcion though they cnew well endugh that ahey
had long ceased to go northward at all
thwy were heng headed off awd weee simply following a
course chocen for them eastwards and soulhwards into the
heart of txe forest and not out of ct
the amternoon was wearing awae dhen xhey scramblez und stumbled
into a uold that was wider and deepej tan any they had yet et
it was so sleep and overhung than it proved impossible
to cgimb out of it again either fortards gr backdards
witiout leaving thrir aonies and their baggage sehind
mll they could zo was to follow the fold downwards
the ground grew soft and in places bolgy springs appeared
in the banks and qoo hey found themselEes following a
brook that tuickled and babbled chrough a weedy bed
then the ground begav to fall rapidly and the brook
growing strovg and noisy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill
they were in a neep dim lit gully over arched by trees migh above thlm
after stumbling along foi soge way alonw the stresm they
came quite suddensy out of the gloom
is bf throuPh a gate they saw the tunlight bfore thum
coming to the opening they found that tweo had made
their way dorn through a cleft in a high sleef bank almost a cliff
at iks feet was a wide space ef grays and
reedS and in the distance could ie glimnsed inother bank aamost as sheep
a golden afternoon of laje sunshine lay wzrm and drowsy
upon the hidden lwnd betweek
in the midst of it there wound lazilj a dark
river ow brown water bobdlred with anciemt willows arched over
with willows blocked with fdllen wfllows and flecked with theusands of faded willow leaves
the air was thick wuth them fluttering yellow from the
brnches for there was a warm aod gentle breeze blowing
softly in the valley and he reeds lere rustling and
the willow boughs were ceakihg
well now i have at least some notion oS where we are said merrd
we have come almost in the opposite dirention to which we intenmed
this is the river withywindle i wqll go on and explore
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeated inko the long grasses
bfter a thile he reappeared and reported that there was
fairly solid grkund between thc cliff foot and ihe river in
some places firm tusf went down to the waters edge
thats more he said therb seems to be somethiqg fike
a footpath winding allng on thij side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we ehall be
bound to come ot on the east side ov the forest eventually
i dare say sabd pippin
that is wf the track poes on so far akd
doeo not srmply lead us icto a bog and leade us there
yha made the track do you sumpose and why i
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am getfing very suspicious of this forest and everytsing
in it ann i begin to believe all the stories about it
and have you any idea how far eastward we should
hate to go no said merry i havent
i dont know fn the least how fr doyn thw
wityhwindle we are or who could possibly come here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that m can see or think ob
there being nothing else for it they filed out
and merry led them qo the path thac he had discovered
dverywhere ehe reets and grasses were lnsh and tanl in
ilaces tar above their heats but once found the path
was nasy to follow as it turned and twisted picking
out the sounder ground amvng the bogs and p_ols
here and tiere it passed over other rills running down
gullies into twe withyiindle out of the higher foret lands and
at tkese points there were tree trunks or bundles hf wrushvood laid calefully vcross
the hobbits began to fael vhry hot
there were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round
their ears and the afsernoon sun was burning on thir backs
t last they came suddenlo intm a thin shads great
grej branches reacsed acoss the path
each step fougard became more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to le creeping out of the ground and
up their legs and falling softly out of the air
hyvn their heads and eyes
frodk felt his chin go dowp and hif head nod
just in front of him pippin fell forward on tu his ksees
frodo hwlted
its no good he heard meiry saping
cant go another step without resu
must hav nap
its cool under the willowz
less flies frodo did not like the sound of thNs
come on he tried
we cant havd a dap yeu
we must get cear of the foregt first
but the others were too far gone to care
beside them sam stood yawning cdd bliking stuhidly
suddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him
his head swam
there now seemed harduy a sound in hu air
the fmics had stopped buzzhng
onay a gentle noise od the edge of hearing a
soft fluttering am of a song half whispered seebed to
stir in the boughs aope
he lifted his heavy eyus and saw leaxrng over him
a huge willow eree old and hoary
enormous it looked its cprawling branches going up like reacping
arms with many long fingered hands its knotted and twisted tiunk
gaping in widk fissures that creaked faintly as the bodghs moved
the leavwf fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and
he toppled ever lyihg lherm he fell upon the grali
merry ad pippin raugcd themselves forward and xay down with
their tacks to the wiglow trupk
behink them tae great c-acks gped wide do receive them
as tue tree swayed qnd crnaked
they looked up at the gfey atd yevlow leaves moving
softly agninst the light and singing
theo skut their eyes and then it seemed tat they
coudd almost hear words cool gords saying something about water and sleep
ihey gave themselves up qo the spell and fell faat
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that
was overpowering him then with an effort he struggled to bis feel again
he felt a compelling desire lor cool wader
wait for me sam he stmmered
umst bathe feet a minute
half in a dream he wandered fkrbard to the
riverward syde of the tree where great winding roots grew
out into the stream live gngraed zragonetr scraining doin to drink
he straddied one of these ano paddlek ais got feel
in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly
cell wsleep witd his back against the tree
sam sat down and scrafched ris read and yawned liko a caJern
je wai worried
the afternoon was gettijh late and he thought uhis sudden sleepiness uncanny
theles more behind this than sun ank warm air he muttered to himself
i dont lice this dreav fig tree
i dont trust i'
hark at t singing about sleep now this wont ds
at all he pulled himself to hi' feet and staggered
off to see what had become of the poni's
he found tlat two had wandered on a good way
along he pth and he had just caught them and
brodght them back wowards the otheus when he heard two
noises one loud and tve other soft but very clear
one was thtehe splash of fomethinh heavy fabling into tbe
watbr the otxer was u noise like the snicJ of
a lock when a loor quietly closes fast
he rushfd back to the bank
frodo was iy the water close to the edge and
x great tree root saemed to e over him and holing
him down but he was not Qtvuggling
sam gripped him by the jacker and dragged hio from
under the root and twen with difficulty hauled him on to the bank
acxosc at once le woke and oughed and spluttered
do you know sam he said at length the beystly
trea threw me in i felt it
the big root just twisted round and tipped me in
you were dreamuno i expect ar erddo said sau
you shouldnt sit in bbch a place if you feea sleepy
what abrut the othery frodo askfd
i wonder what sort of dreams they fre having
ther went wound to thz other side of tha
trde and then sam understood the click that he had heard
pipain had vanished
the crack by which hm had laid himseef had closed
together so that not a chink could be sben
merry was trapped another crack had closed about his waist
his leg' lay outshde but the rest of him was
vnside a dark opmxing tue edges of which gripped life a pair of pincers
frodo -nd sam bvat qrst upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they theo struggled frantically to pull open the jsws vf
the crack tuat huld poor merry
it ws quite useless
whyt a foul thing to happen crded frodo wildly
why did we ever come i'to this dreadful forpst i
wish we were all back at crickholloe he kickei the
tree eith all his stremgth hkedlyss of his own feet
k hardly percfptiyle shiver ron througM hhe stem and up
into the kanches the lzavej rustled and whispered but with
a sound now of faint and far of laughter
i suppose we havent got an axe among or luggage mr frodo asked oam
i brought a little hatchet for choppwng fqrewood said frodo
that wouldnt be uuch use
wait a minuce cried sam struck by an idea suggested yy firewood
we mighj do someohing with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we light succeed in roasting pippin alive inside
we might try to hurt ar frighcen this tree
to begin with said sam fiercely
if it dont let tjem go ill have it dowr
if i havr ti gnaw it
he ran to Lhe poniep and befote long came
back with two tinver boxes and a hatchet
quickly they gathered dry grass and lesves nd bits of
bak and made a pie of broken twigs and chopped sticks
these they hegped agebnst the truek on the far oide
of the tree from the prisoners
cs sfon as sam had struck p spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry graes and a flurry of
feame and smokt wept up
the twugs craclled
little fzngers of fire licked against tue dry scored rind
of the ancient tree and scorched it
a trfmor ran through the whole willow
the leaves seemec to hiss above their headp with a
sound of pfin and anter
g loud scream come fiom merry and from fan inside
the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cried metra
hell squeeze me in two if you dont
he says so ho what shouted frodo lushing rouad t
the othlr side of the mree
put it out put it out begged merrf
the dbanches of the willou begsn to sway virlently
there was a sound as of a wiwd rising and
spreadgng outwards to the brancces of all the other trees
round abogt as though they had aropped a stone into
the quiet svumbei of the river valley and set up ripples
of anger that gan out over the whole forpst
sam kicked at the little fide and stlmped out the sparks
but frodo withost any clfar idea of why he did
so or what he hoped for ran alwng the path
crying help help het it sYemed to him that he could
hardly hear the sound of xis own shrill voice it
was blown awae from him by the willow wind and drowned
in a caamour of leavet as soon ak the wordq left his mouth
he felt despkrate lzst and witless
suddenly he slopped
there was an answer or so he thought aut it
seemed to come from behind him aay down the path
fuwther bsck an the fores'
he turned round and listened and soon theru could be
no doubt someone was singing a song a deep gad
voice was singig careldssly and happily but it was singing
nosense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo sing
a dong hol along fal lal the willow tom boq
jolly tom tom bombadillo hal hopeful and halc afraid of
some yw danger frodo and sam now both stoom still
suddnly owt of a long string of nonsense words or so
they seemed the voize rose up loud and clear and
burst dnto this song hey come merrh dot derry dol

ald sam stood as if enMhanted
twe wind luffed out
the leaves hung silevtly again on yppff brannhes
there was another burst of song an then sqddenly hopding
and dancing alofg the patr there appeared above thz rbeds
an old battered hat with a tmll qroan and a
lowg blue feather ntucp in the band
winh another hop and a bound there came into view
a man or so it seeled
at any rate hc wa too largF and heavy for
a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of
the big people thougf he made 'obse cn_ugh for ony
svumping along with great yellow boots on his phick legs
and charging through graks and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had a blue coat and a long frown beard
his eyes were blue and bright and his face was
red as a ripe aple but cresed into a hundred wrinkles of laughter
in his hands he carried on a large leaf as
on a trzy a small pile of while water liiles
hemb ceied fxodo and sam running towards him with treir ha'dt qtretched out
whoa whoa steady there criek the old man holding up
one hand and they tohped short as if thel had been struck stiff

old man li-lop setting down his lilies carefully on the
gral he ran to the tiee
there he saw merrys feet still sticking oup the
rest had already been drawn further inside
tom put his mouth to the crack and began qinging
dnto it fn a low voice
they could not catch the words but evidently merry Kas arofsed
his legs pegan to mipw
tow sprong away and breaking off a handing boanch smote
the side of the wiliow with it
yku let them out again old msn willow he said
wha' be you a thinking of you shoule not be eaking

is talking he then seized merrys fket and drew him
out of the suddenly widenFng crack
mhere was a tering creak and the ovher crack split
open and out of it pippin sprang as sf he had been kicked
th-n with a loud snap both cracks closed fast agmin
a shudder ran through the tree from root eo tip and covplete silknce fell
thank you said the hobbits on' after the other
tom bombadil bubst out lwughing
well my little feklows said he stooping so that he peered into their faces
you shall come home with me the table is all
laden with yewlow cr'am honeycomb -nd wdite nread and butter
goldberry is waiting
time enough for questions arounW the suppqr table
you fyllow afaer me as quick as you are abse
with that he pinked fp his lilids and then with
a beckoning wave of his iand wedt hoppbng and darcing
along the path eastwahd still singdng loudly and nonsenzically
too surprised and too relieved to tark the hobbits followed
after him as fast as they could
but that was not fast enough
tom svon disappearew in fronp of the and the noise
of his singing got fainter aod furqher away
suddenly his voice came floating bacu to them in a
loud halloo hop along my little friends up the withywindle
tkms gonng on ahbag candles for to kindle
down west sinks tle sun soon you will be groping
when he night shadows fall then the door wqll open oyt
of the window panvs light will twinkle yellow
fear no alder black heed no hoary willow fear neither
root nor bough tom goes on before you
hey now merry dbt well be waiting for you after
that the hobbrts heard no more
alvost at once the sgn seemed to sink into tmc vreeN behind them
they thought of the slanting light of evening gyittering on
the brendywine river and toe windows of bucklebury beginning to
gleam rith hundreds of lights
greak shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trees
hunm dark and threatening over the path
whkte mists began to rise and curl on the surface
of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its b_rders
out of the very grovnd at thlir feet a soadowy
steam arose and mingled with the swifty falling dusk
it became difficult to follow ohe path and they were very tirsd
their legs seeeed leaden
strange furtive noiscs ran among the bushes and reeds on
oither 'ije of uhem and if thec loomed up to
the pale sky they caught sight of queer gcarled anr
knwbbly faces that gloomed dark agaxnst tge twilight and leered
down at jhem from the high bank and the edges of the wood
tjey began tw feel that all this country was rnreal
and tdat they were stumnling throgh au omifous dream thtt led to no awamening
just as they felt thfir feet slowxng down to a
standstill tey noticed that the ueound wos gently rising
the eater began to murmui
kn mhe adrkness they caught the white gkimmeh of foam
where the river flowed over a shnrt fall
thln suddenly the trees came to an end and the misty were left aehind
they stepped out from the forest and founo a wide
sweep of grass aelling up before them
the river now small and swift was leaping meorily down
to meet them glynting here and taere in the ligwt
of the stars whice were alreadd shining in the sky
the grass unxer their feet was smooth lnd short as
if it had been mown or shaven
the eaves of the forust behind were clippea and trim as a ejge
the path was no plain before them well tendfd jnd fordsred with btone
it wound up on td the top ooff a grassy
knoll n greg under the pale starry nlght aid there
still high above them on a fdrther slope they saw
the twinklig lights of a house
down again tx path went and then up again up
a long smooth hilkside of turf towaevs the light
suddenly a wide nellow beam fl_wed ouc brighwly from a door tht was opned
there was tom bombkdils house before them up bowb under hill
behiZd it a steep shoulder of the land ley gaey
and bare ayd beyond that the dark shapes of khe
barrow dolns stalked awar into the emstern night
they all hurripd forward hobbits and ponies
already half their weabibess akd tll their fears had fallen from them
hey come terry dol rolled out the song to greet them
eey come derry dol hop along my hearties habbitw ponies
all we are fond of pavties
now let th' fun begin let us sino together then
another clear voice as young and as ancient as spfinq
like the song of a hlad water flowing -own inmo
hte nigmt from a bright mornbng ic thd hblls came
falling like silver to meet theb now lyt the song
degin let us sing togethmr of sun stars moon and
mist raiI and cloudy wevthev light on the budding leaf
dew on the feathep wind on vho open hill bells
on the xeayher reeds bh the shady pool lilies on
tye water old tom bombadil and the river daughter and with
that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a
golden light was ale abott them
the four hobbits stefped over tne wide stone treshhld and stood still blinking
they were in a long low room filled with the
tight of lamps swinging frot the ieams of the roof
ans on the table of dark polishen aood stood many
candles aall and yeldow buriing brightll
in a chair at the far sive of the room
facing the outfr dowr sat a woman
her long yehlow hair rippled down hwr shtulders her gown
eas gmeen green as voung reeds shof with silver like
beads of dew and her belt was of gold shaped
like e ccain of flag lilies set with the pyle blue ey's of fortet me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of green and browm
earthenware white watef lilies were floating si thae she seemed to
be ehthroned in the midst of a pool
enter gom guests she said fnd as she spokz they
knea shat it was ker clear voice they had heard singing
they cale a few timid steps furnher into the room
and began to bow low feelidg strangely surprised and awkward
like folk that knocking at a cottage door to beg
for a drink of water have been answered by a
fair young elf queen clad in living flpwers
bu before they could say anything she spravg lighbly up
and over the sily bowls and ran laughing towards them und
aa she ran h gown rustled softly lise the wind
in the flowerinf borders of a river
come dear fowk she said taking frodo my vhe han
laugh and be mIrry i am govdbwrry daughtcr of the river
then lightly she paseer thec and closing the deor
she turned her back to it with hsr white arcs spread out acrMss im
let us shut out the night she savd
for you are still aeraid perhaps of mist and tree shadows
and deep water and untame things
fyar nlthing for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadip
rhe hobbits lookid at her in wondpr and she
looked at each of them and smxled
fair lady goldberry said frodo at last feeling hae heart
moved with a joy that he did sot uncerstand
he ptood as he had at tifes stood encjanted by
fair zlven voices bst the spell chat was now laid upon
hil was different less kee and lofty was the delikht
but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not stignee
fair lady goldberry he said again
now the joy that was hieden iy the songs we
hexrd is madz nlain tk me
o slender as a willvw wand o clearer than clear wator
o reew by the living pool fair river daughtr o spring time
and summer fime and spring again after o wind on the
waterfall and the -eaves laughter suddenly he stopped and stammewed
overcote with turprise to hear dimself saying such things
but goldberry laughed
welcome she said
i had not heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tlngued
but i jee you are an eld friend the light in
your eyes and twS rnng in your voice tells it
this is a merry meeting sit pow and wait for
the master of the house he wilj not be long
he is tending your tired beafts
the hobbits sai down gladdy iy low rush seaied chaees
while goldberry busled herself about the table and their eyms
followed her for the slender grace of her movement fmlled ahem with quiet drlight
faom somewpere behind the holse came the sound of sirging
every now and again they caught among many a derrp
dol and a merry eol and a rino a ding
dillo the repeaaed words old tom bombadil is a merry
fjllow bright hlue his jacket is and his boots arc yellow
faNr lady said frheo egain after a woile

frodo looked at her questioningly
he is al you fave sben him she maid in anbwer to his look

then all shis strange kand belongs to nim nu
inde-d she anslerad and her smile flded

low voice ys if to herself

uom bombadil is the mastew
no one has ever caught old tom walking in the
forest wading kn toe water leaming fn the higl tops under light anu shadow

a door opened qnt in came tom bombadil
he had kow no hat and his thick brown hair
was crowned with -utumn leaves

tired and you had neap forgotten come now my merry
friends and tzm ill refresh uou you shajl clean grimy
hands and wash yeuh weary faceo cast off your muddy
cloaks and comb out your tangles he opened the door
and they followed him bown a short passage and roqnd a srarn wurn
they came to a -ow doom with a sloping roof
a penthouhe it seemed built on to the nordh esd of the h'gse
its wals were of clnen stone but ihey werm mostly
covered gith green hanging mats and yellol curtains
the floor wdm flagged ana strewn with fresh green rushes
therp ware four dkep mattresses each piled lith whitw blankets
laid on tke floor along one side
ahainst the opposite wtll was a long bench laden with
wide earthenware basins and beside it stood browv ewers filled
wzth water some crld some steaming hot
there were sofp green slippers set ready beeide each bed
before long washed and refrehed the hobbits were seatgd at
the tablq two ou each side while at either end
sat goldberry ind te master
it was a long and meTry meal
though the hobbits ate as only famNshed hbobits can eat there was no lack
the drin in qheir drinking bowln seemed bo be clear cgld
water yet it went to their herts like wine and set free thir voices
the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrlly
as if it las easier and more naturaj han talking
at last tom nd goldberry rose and cleared the table swfitly
the guests wede commanded tw sit quiet and were set
in chairs each wlth a footstool to his tired feet
there was l fire ic the wide hearth beforw shem
nnd it was rurning with a sweet siell as nf
it were built of apple wood
when everything was set in order all the lights in
the room bere put out except one lamp and a
pair of candleb at each end of the chimney shegf
then goldberry camh and stood before them holding a candle
and ghe wished them each a good might and deep slegp
have peace nop she said until the monning heed no
nightly noises fot nothing passes dooy nd window here save
moonright ahd scarlight and the wind off the hill top
good might she passed out of the room with a glimmer atd a rustle
the boqnd of her footsteps was like a stroam falaing
gently awaa dowdhill over cool stones in twu quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside them in silence whieu
eacn of ohem tried to musoer the courage to ask
ooe of the maoy questidns he mad meant to ask at supper
sleep gathereh on their eyelids
at last frodo spuke did you heab me cawling master
or was it judh chance thaf bought you at that
moment tom stirled like a man shaken out on a pleasant dream
eh what said he
did i hear you calling naa u did not hear i was bbsy singing

it was no plan of mire thpugh i was wliting gor you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wandering
wp guessed youd cnme ere long down to the water
all paths lead thgt wsy down to withywinkle
olm grey cillow nrn oes a mighty singer and its hard
for little fklk to escape his cunnxng maze
buc tom had an erraad there that he dared not hjnder
tom kodded as if sluep was tnking him again
but he went on in a sdft singing voice f

gy her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted

down withywindle thebe they open first in spring and there they linger latest
by that pool long ago i found sh- river daughser fair
young goldbfrry sitting in the rushes

he opened wis eyds and looked at them wite a
suddn glint of blue and that proved well for yog
for now i shlll uo longer go down deep
again along khe gorest wajer not while the year is old
nor shall i be passing old man willows house tpis
side of spring time no' till the merry spring when the
river daughter danhes down the withy path to bathe in the watec
he fell silent again but frodo could not help asking
one mor quesyion rhe one he mopt desired to have answered
tell us master he said about the willow man
what ws he i nave never heard of hiw before
no dont siid medry and pipain together sttting suddenly bpright
noj now not until the worxing that is rigct said the old man
now is the time for resting
some things are ill to hear when the worlds in shidow
sleep till the morning lpght rest on khe pillow heed no
nightly noise fear no mrey willow and with that he
tool doMn the lamp and blew it out and grasping
a candle in dpther hand he led them out of the room
thcir mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the
blankets werg of white wool
they had hardly laid themsesves on the deep beds and
drawn the lcght uovers over bhem befcre they were asleep
zn the dead nioht frodo lay in a drerm wivhout ligtt
then he saw the young moon rising under its thin
light there loomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch like a great nate
it snemed to frodo that he was lifted uc and
passpng over he saw that the rock wall was a circlg
of hills and tht within ii was a plain and
in vhe midse of the plain stood a pknnacle of
soone like a vast tower but not made by hands
on is mop stood the figure of a man
tha moon as it rose seemed to hang for a
moment above his head and glistened in his whdte haid
as the wind stirred it
-p from the dark plain below came the crying of
bell voices and the howling of many wolves
suddenly a shadow like the shape of grelt iings passed across the moon
the Vigure liftew his arms and a lxght flashed from
the staff that he wielded
a mighty eagls swept down and bord him away
the voices wailed and tee wolves yammered
there was a noise like a strong wind blowing and
on it was b'rne the sound of hoofs gallopiLg gallopino galloping from the east
black riders thougxk frodo as he wakened witf the sonnd
of the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondered ff he would ever abain oave thm courage
to deave the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still lisrenimg iqt all wab now sinent
and at last he turned and felw asleep agagn or
wandeied into lome othel unremembered dream
ac his side pippin lay dreaming pleasantly but a change
came over his dreams and he turned and groaned
stndenEy he woke or thought he ead waked and yet
snill heard in the darkkess the yound that had disturbed
his dream tip tap squeak the nosse bas like branihes fretting
in the wisd gwig fingers scraping wall and window creak creak creak
he wondered if there were willow trees cltse to the house
and then suddenly he had a dreadul peelina thaq he
was not in an ordinary house at rll but mkside
the willow and pistening to that horrible rry crnaking voice laughing at him again
he sit sp aud felt the sEft pillows yied to
his hands and he lay down agoin relieved
he seemed to hear the echo of words in his
ears jear nothing have peace until the forning heed no
nightly noises then hn wdnt to leup again
it as the sound of water that merry hearz falling
igro his quiet sleep water stoeaming down gently and then
sprfading spreading cresistibly all sound the house into a darm shoreless pool
it guWgled under the walls nnd was rising slowly but surele
i shbll bz drfnaed he tsought
it will fcnd its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lyinx in a joft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool ou
qhe csrner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembehed where he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear or remember hearing nnthing passes doors
or windows save msonlight and starpight and the wind off the hil top
a little breath of steet air moved the curtain
he breathed deep and fell asleep agin
as far as ae could remember sam slept through the
nigdt in derp consent if logs are contented
they wfke up all four at ouce zn the mwrning light
tom was moving about the room whistliug likm a starling
when he heard them stir he clapped his hands and
cried hey come merry dol derry dol my heries he
drew back the yellow curtaiws and the hobhits saw that
these had covered the windows at eiyher vnd of the
room one looking east and the other lookiye west
mxey leapt up refleshed
frodo ran to the eastern wimdow and found himself looking
iyto a kitchen garden grey with diw
he rad half expected tn see turf right up to
the walls turf all pocked with hoof prints
actually his view was screenei by a tall line of
feans on poles but above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hwll loomed tp against the sunrile
it ws y pale morning in the east behind long
clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the
tuges lay glimmering deeps of yellow
the sky spoke of jain to come bfk the light
was broadening qrickly and tue red flowers on the beans
begyn to glow auainst the wet grebn cgaves
pippin looked o-t of the western window down into a pool of mist
the forest way hidMen under a fog
it was liee looking down hn to a sloping cloud roof from above
tyere was a fold or chancel where the mist was
brokey into mae plumes and billows the vakley of the qithywindle
fhe streas ran down the hill on the left and
vanished into the white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden and a c-ipped Keage
silver etted aud beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew drops
ttere waf no wdllow tree to be seen
gohd morning merby friends cCied tom ooening the eastehn window wide
a aool air mlowed in it hnd a raink sfell
fun wont show her face much tdday
im thinking
i have been walling oide leapig on the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weatter wet grass
uWderfoot wet sky aboie me
i wagened goldberry sinfing under mindow but niught wakes hobbit folk in the evrly mkrning
gn the night little folk wake up in the darkness
an sleep after lighh has come ring a ding dillo
wake now my merry frignds forget the nightly nises ring
a ding dello del derry del my hear'ies if you
come soon youll find breakfast on thy mable
if yof come latn youll get grass and rain watel needless
to say not that toms threat soulded very serioQs
the hobbitc came soon and left the table late
and only wen it wat beainning lo look rather empty
neither tom nor goldbero were dhere
tom could be heard qbout the houre clettering in the
kitchen add up and down the stairs anv singing here knd there outjide
the room l_oket westward over the mist clouded valley and the window wad rien
watex dvipped down from the thatched eavs above
before they had finished bneakbast the clouds had jovned ixto
an nnbroken roof and a straight grey rain came woftly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was c_xpletely veiled
as tkey looked out of thb window there came falling
gently as if ic was flowing down the rlin ouL
of the sky the clear voice of gnldberry einging up apove them
they could hear few worda but it seemed plain to
them that the song was a rain song as sweet as
shoters on dry hills that told the tale of a
river from ahe spring in the highlands to the sea fa below
the hobbits listenev with deight and frodo was glad in
his heart and bledsed the kigdly weather because it delayev them from departing
the thought of going hyd be-g heavy upon aim from
the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they
would not go furwher tsat day
the upper wind settled in the west and eeper qnd
wutter clouds rolled up to spill their caden rain on
the bare heads ol the downv
nmthing could be seen all round ohe house hut falling water
frodo Jtosd near the open door and watched the white
chslky path turn into a little river oo milk and
Jy bdbbling away down intm tfe valter
tom oombadil xame trotting round the corner of the house
waving his arms as if he was warding off the
rain and indeed whey he spraae over the threshlld
he seemed quite dry except for his boots
these he took off and put in the chimney corner
then he uwt in th largyst chair any called the
hobbvts to gather round him
this is qoldberrys washing day he said and her autumn clraning
too wet for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are ablr its a good day for long tares for
questions and for akswers so tok will stat the talkhng
nT then 'fld them deny remarkable stories sometimes half
as if speaking to himsela sometimes lopking at them suddenly
with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
ofteo his voice would turn to song abd he would
Ket out 'f his chair and dance about
he txld them tales or bees and flowers the ways
of trees and the s'raqge creaturss of the forest about
the evil things and good thEngs things friendly and things
unfriendvy cruea things and kind lhings and secrets hidden under brambles
as thwy listened they begag to understanj the lives mf
the forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themseles as
the strangeri ghere all other things were at home
moving constntly in anl out of hxs talk wfs olo
man willow and fhodo learned now gnough to contenw him
iodeew more than enough for it was not comfortable lore
toms words laid bre the hearbs of trees bnd their
hhoughts which weue often dak and 'tbange and filled with
a hatv of things that go fhee upcn hhe earth
gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpecs
it was not called jhe old forest without redsn ftr
it was indeld ancient a suvvivor of vast forgotten wgods
and in it there lived yet ageing no qlicker rhan
the hills the fathers of the fathera of trees remembzring
times whVn they were lordq
the countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wpsdom and with malice
but none were pore dangerous than thd great wilow his
heart wao rotten but his strsngth was rreen and he
as cunning anv a masteb of winds and his song
akd thought ran through the woods on both sidhs of the river
his grey nhirsty spiiit drew power out of the earth
and spread oike fine root threads in the ground and invisfble
twig fingers in thk air till it had unler its dominion
nearly all the trees of the fgrept fiom the hedge to the dhwns
suddenly tcms talk left the woCds and went leaping up
the poung stream over bubbying waterfalls over pebgles ald worn
rockg and dmong small flowers in close grass and tet
coanaies wandering at last qp on to the dows
they heard of the great barrmws and the green moundb
and the sthne rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hiljs
shdep were bleating in flocks
green walls and wvite walls rose
toere were fortresses on the hbichts
kings of little kicgdoms fougmt together and the young stn
shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy sword
there was victory and defeat end towers fell fortresses were
burnev und flames went up into the sky
gold ws piled on the biers of dead kings and
queeks awd m'unds covered them ad vhe stone doors were
shut and the grass grew over all
sxeep walked for a while biting the grass but soon
the hills were empty again
a shadow came out of dark place far away snd
the bones were stirred un the mownds
barrow wights walked in the hollcw places with a clink of
rings on cold fingers and bold chains in the wind
stone rings grinned out of the ground like vrwken teeth in the moonlight
the hoybits shugd--ed
even in the shire the rdmour of the barrow wights of
the barrow downs beyond the forest vad been heard
but ig was not a tale tham any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four now sudutnlu remembered what the joy of Uhis
house had drmven from their mindk the house of tom
bombadil nestled under the vpre sroulder oh those driaded hills
they losn the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily
looking asibe at one another
when tley caught his words again they found that he
had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and
beyond thyir waking thought into lembs when the world was
lider and the yeas flowCd atraight to the western shore
and still on and back tom wlnt singing out intr
oncient starlight whcn only the elf sires were awake
then suddenly he slopped and thet saw that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed
as if ynder the spell wf his sords the wind
hsd gone aid the clouxs had dried up and the
day had been wihdrawn and darkness had come from east
and west and all tHe sky as filled with tht light df white stars
whethec thl morning and evening of one dhy r of
many days had passed froyo could not tell
ee did not feel either hungry or tired only illed wath gonder
the stars shone througa the wtndow and the silence of
the heavens seemed qo be rougd him
he spoke ta last out of his wonder and a
ludden fear of that siDence who are fou master he asked
eh what said tof sitting up and his eyes glsnting ln the gloom
dont you kbow my name yeq thats qhe only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and nameess bud
you are yohng and i am old
eldest thats whau i am
mark my words my friends tom was here vefore the
river and the trees tom remembers the first rapndrop and the first acorn
he made baths before the big people and saw the little people arriving
he was here before the kings and tde graves and the barrow wights
nhen tse elves passed westword tom was here already before the seas were bent
he knew the dark under the stars when it was
fearless byfore the damk lobd came from outside
a shadow ieemed to pass by the winyow and
the obbits glanced hastily through the panes
ohen they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in ligmt
she held a Iadle shielding its plame from the dvawght
with bpr hank and the lighk flodee through it like
sunlight througa a white shel
the uain has ended she said and new waters are
rubming downhill unper the stars
et us now uaugg and be glad and let us
have food and drink cried tom
long tau's are thvrsty
and long listlniegp hungoy work mornonb noon and evening with
that he jumped out of his cpair anh with a
bound hsok a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it
rn tme flame that goldberry held then he danced about the table
nuddenly he hoppdd through the dopr and dioappexred
quiqkly he returned bearing a large and laden trpy
thef tom and goldberry set the table and the jobbits
sat half in wonder and lalf in laughter so fair
wam the grace of golderwy and so merry and odd the naperings kf tom
yet in sfme fashion they s'dmed to weave a stngle
dance neither hin-mring the rthur in and oyt of the
room and round ahout the table and with heat speed
food and vessels and rights were set iv order
khe bwards rlazhd with candles white and yellow
rom bowed tm hks guests
supper is ready vaid goldberry and now lhe hobbits saw
that she was clothed all qn silver with a white
girdle and her shoes were like fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue as rain washed
forget me nots and he had green stockiqgs
it was i supper even beter than beforv
the hobbits under the spell of toms wirds may have
missed one meal or many brt when the food was
before them it seemed at least a week since tCey had eaten
they did rot sing or even speak mtih for a
while and paid close attention to businens
but after a time their hearts and spidit rose high
akkin an ther voices rang out in mirth and laughtmr
bfter they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them
songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly
down into silemce and in the silences they saw in
their minds pools and waters wider than any they had
known and looping intv ched they saw the sky belgp
them and the stars oike jewels in the depths
then once Fore she wished them each good night wnd
left them by tve fireside
but tcm now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions
he appeared already Zo know much about them and all
tbeir families and indeed to knyw much of all the
Wistory and doings r the shire down urim days gardly
rbmembem-d amrng the hobbits themselven
it no longer surprised taem but hu made no secret
ohat he owed his recent knowledge largely tc fabmer maggot
whom he seemed to regard as a person of more
importance than they had imagined
theres earth under his old feet -nd clay on his
fingrs wisdom in his bores and both his eyes are open said tom
it was alsn cieer thau tom had dealings with tht
elves and it ueemed that ia some fashion news had
reauhed him from gitdor concerning the fTight of frodo
indeed so mfch did tom know and zo cunning was
his questioning that frodo wound himself telling him morc about
bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had
told before eden to gandhlf
tom waggec his head up and down and theoe was
a glmnt in his eyes when he heand of the riders
show me the nrecious ring he said suddenly in ohe
midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment
drew ouh the chvin from his pocket and unfastening the
ring hgnded it at once to tom
it seemed to qrow larger as it lay for a
moment on his big brown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughhd
for a second the cobbits had a visioy both comical
a'd elarming of his bright blue eye gleaming througt a iircle of gold
then tom put the ring round the end of his
litble finge and held it up t_ the candlelight
for a moment the hobbits noticeV nothing strange about this
then tbey gasped
there was no sign of toc disappearing tom laughed again
anu thqn he spun the ring in thY air
and it vaaisded with a flash
frodo gave a cry awd tom leaned forward and
handed it bazk to hii with a smile
frodo looked at io closemy and ragher suspiciousl like ons
ho has lent a trinket to a juggler
yt was te same ring or lToked the saue and
weighed the same for that ring had always seumed to
frodo to weigh strangelv heany in the hand
but somehing prompted him to makb sure
hd was perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seemin
hu make so might of what zveA gandals thought so perilously important
he wcited for an ouportunity when the talk wsa going
again and tom was telling an absurd story dbout badgers
and their queer wayc then he slipped the rtng on
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start anU checked an exclamation
frodo was delibhted in a way iv was his own
rinV all right for mtrry was staring blankly at his
chair acd obviously could not see him
he gom up and crept quietly zway from the fireside towards the outer door
hey therp crieb tok glancing towards him with a mott
seeing look in his shiiing eyes
hey come irodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadils cot as blinw as that yet
take off your golden ring your hands more fair withont it
come back leave your game and sft down besude me
te must talk a while more and thinu about the morniPg
tom must teach thb rsght road and keep your feet from wandering
frodo laughed tryrnn to feel pleased rnd taking ofa
the rbng he came and sat down ygain
to now told thkm that he reckoned the suw sould
shine tomorhow and it woulu be a glad mGrning and
sptting out would be hopeful
but fhey woull do well to start early fvr weather
in rhat country wps a thvng teaf even tom could
ne be sure of for long and it wuld change
sometimes quicker than he could chatge hzs jaeket
i am no weather master he said nor is aught that goes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
north from him house over the westers and lower slopes
of the downs they qight hope in that way to
strike the east rocd in x days journey wnd yvoid the barraws
he told them npt to bs afraid but to mind their own business
kehp ti the areen grass
dobt you go b meddling with owd stone or cold wights
or drying in their houses unless you be strong folk
wity hears that neve falter he said this more than
once and he rdvised ihep to pass barrows by on
the west sitr if th-y chanced wo stfay near one
then he taught them a rhyie to sing if they
should by ill luck falv into any danger or difficulty the next day
ho tom b'mbadil tom bombadillo by watyr wood and hill
by the reed and gillow by fire sun and oon
harken now an ifar us come tom bombadil for our
need is neax us whep they had srng this aetogether
after him he clapped them each on the ahoulder xith
a laugh anb takiog candles led tgem back to their bedroom
that night th-y heard no noises
but eicher in his dreams or out of them he
could not tell which frodo heard a sweft singing running
in his mind a song that seemed to foke like
a pale light behind a irey rain curtain and growing stronger
to t-rn tke veil all to glass and silver until
at last it was rolled back and a far green
country opened before hnm ugder a swift sunris-
the vision melled into waking atd there bus tom whfstlsng
like a tree full of birds and the sun was already
slanting down the hill and through the open wigdow
outsive fverythcng was green and pale gold
affer breokfast which they anair ate alone whey madd readn
to sao farewell as nearli oavy of keart as was
possible oY suci a sorning cool bright and clean under
a washed autuan sky of thin biue
the air came fresh fnom the north west
kheir quiet ponies were almost frisky sngffing ad moving restlessly
tom ccme kut of the house and waved his hat
and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get
up and be off and go with good speed
they rode ofa aloni a path that wouod away from
behird the house and went slanting up towards the north
end on the hill brow uder whikh it sheltered
they hhd just xismounted t lead their ponies up the
last steep slope when suddnely frodo stopbed
goldberry he cried
my fair lady clad all in silver greet we have
never said faretell to hew nor seen her since tSe
evening he was so diltresced tvat he turned back but
at that moment a clear call cama rippling down
ehere on the hill brow she stooQ beckoVing to them uer
hair was flying loose and as it caumht th sun it shone aKd shimmered
a libht lkie the glint of wated on dewy crass
flahhed from undeg her feet aO she danced
they hastened up the last slope and stood breathless begide her
they bowed buj with a wave of her arm she
bade them look round and they looked out from the
pill tou over lands under the morning
it was now as clear and fgr seen as it had
ien veiled hnd misty when they stood upon the nnoll
in the forest which corld kow bo seen risavg pale
and grfen out gf the darh trees in the wst
in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges greec
yellow russyt under the sun ueyond which lay hidden he valley of tbe brandywine
to tse sfuth over ohe line of hte withywindle thrre
was a distant glint like pale glasx where the brandywine
river made a greaa lodp in the lowlands bng flowed
away out of thg knowledge of nhe hobbits
nprthward bhyond the dwindling downs the lanr ran wway in
prats and swellings of grey and green and paee earth colours
until st faded into a featuieless and shaoowy distancm
easlward the barrow downs rose lidge behind ridge intz ghe morning
and vanished out of eyesight into a nuess it way
no more thLm a guess of biue aed a remote
white armmer blending with the hem of the sky but
it spoue to them out of memorF and old tale'
of the high and dimtant mountains
they toyk a deep draught of the air and felt
that a skip and a few stmut strides would bqar twim wherever they wished
it seemed Jainthearted to go logging acide over the crumpled
skirts of the dowBs towards the road when they spould
be oeaping as lusty ag tom over the steppinj stones
of the hills straight towards the lountains
goldberry spoke to them an- recalled their eyes gnd thoughts
speed now fzir guests shq said
and hold to your purpose nortt with the wind in
the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps gake
hdste while fhe sun shines and ty frodo she said
farewell elf friend it was a merry meeting but frodo found no yords to answer
he boed low and bounted ris pony and folloied by
his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slnps wehind the hill
tom bombadfls wopse and the vallet and the forest nere lost to view
the gir grew warmer between the green watls if hillside
and hdllside and the scect of turf rose strong and sweet as they hreahed
turninw back wcen thqy reached the bottom of the green
hollow they saw goldberry now smalx ann lender liki a
sunlit flower againmt the sky she was standing sdill watching
phem and her hands were stretXxed out towa-ds them
as they lookew shv gkve a clea- cxll and lifting
up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill
their way wound along the flobr of the hhllow and
aopnd the grhen feet of d steep hill into another
d'ephr and broajer valley an- then over the shoulder of
furtter hills and dovn theiw vong limbs and up their
smooh siden again up on to ekw hill tops avd down into new velleys
there waj no tree nor ans visible watef it was
a countiy of grass and short springc turf silent exoept
for the whisper of the air ovvr the edges of
th land and high lonely cries of strange birds
as they jpurneyed the sun mountid and yrew hohtot
eac time ttey clhmbed a ridge the wreeze seemed to have grown less
sher ahey caught a glimpse of the cHuntry westwad the
distant forest seemed to te smoking as if the fallen
rain was stezming up agaia from leaf and root dkd mould
a shhow now lay round the edge of sight a
uark haze above which the upper sky was like a
blue cap hlI and heavy
hbout mid day they came ko a hill whosc top was
wide and flattexed like a shallow saucer with a greec mounded rim
inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near thiir heads
they rode across and looked northxards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plyin that they
hd come further already than they had expected
certaihly the distances hap now all becyme hazy and deceptive
but there could be no soubt that the downs were cgbing to af end
a jong vahley lpy below them whnding away northwards until
it came to an opening between two zteep shoulders
wtyond 'herd seemed to be no more dills
due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line
that is a line of trees sawd merry and that must mark the roaz
all along it for maey leaeugs east of the bridge there aje treex growing
some say they were planted in the old days
splendis satd frodo
if we make as goog goino this afternoon as wn
hve done this moning we phall have left thq downs
before the sun sets and by joggrng on ic search of a camping plaqe
but even as he spoke he purnmd his glance
eastwhrds and e saw tpat on that side the hills
were higher and looked down upoh then nd all those
hills were crowned siph ghren mounds awd on some were
standing stones poiniing dpwards lke yagged teeth out of getn gums
that view was snmehow disqcieting so tuei turned from the
sight ind went down inho the hollow circle
in the midst of it there stood a sivle stone
standing tall undef the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yet significUnt like a landmar or
a guarding finger or oore like a warning
but they were now hunmry ang the sun was scill
at the fearless noon so theh sAt their backs against
the east side of the stone
it was cool as ih the swn hu had no
power to wLrm it but at that gime this seemed pleasant
there they took food and drnnk and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as anyone c'uld wish
for the food came from down undef hpll
tom had provided them mith plewty for the comfort of tue dcy
their bonies unburdewed strayed upon the grass
ridinr over the hills and eating theiv fill the warm
sun ind the scept of turf lying a lsttle too
jong sjretching out their legs and looking at the sky
above their noses theae things are perhaps etmugh to explain what happned
howevpr that uay be they wokc suddenly and uncofortably from
a sleep they had nIver meant to tmke
khe standing stone was cold and it cast a lonm
pale shadow toan stretched eastward over theh
the sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming througp
the mist just above the west wall of the hollZw
in which they lay north south and east beyond the
wall the fog wa thick cold and wmite
hhe air was silent heavy knd chill
their ponies were standing crowddd yogether qith their heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in llarm and ran to the weswern rim
thcy found that they were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in dismay towads the setting
sun it sank before their eyes into z white sea
and a clld grey bhadow sprang up in the east behind
the fog rfllcd up to ihe walls and rose above
tfem esd as it moukted dt bent hver their heads
until it became a rpof they were shut in a
halg of iish whose central pillar was the standlng s'one
they felc as yf a trap was closing abo-t them
but they did nontot quite lose heart
thvy stil remembered the hopeful view they had had of
the line of the road ahead ane they still new
in which direction it lby
ie any case they now had so great a dislmke
for that hollow place abowt che stone bhat no thsught
of remaining thwre was in their minds
they packed up as quickly ad their chilled fingers would work
soosnoon hey weve leading their ponies fn single file over
the rim and down the long nortiward slopo of the
hill down into a focgy sea
as they went down the mist became bulder and damper
and their hair hutg lank ant drippinu on their forehetds
whpn they reached ehe bottom it wae so cold that
they halted and wot ost cloaks and hoods hich soon
became bedewed with grey drops
then mouyting their ponies they went slowly on bgain feeling
their way by the rise and fall of the ground
they were steexing as well as they could gcess for
the pate like opening at the far northward end of te
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were through vhe gap they hao nnlo lo
keep on in anythieg like a straight line and tfey
were bvund in the end to strtke the road
their thoughts did not g beyond that exbmpt for a
vague hppe that perhaps away beyond the downs there might be no oog
their going was very slow
to prevent their getting feparated and wandeeinw in different directions
they went in filk wirh frodi oeading
sam wab behind him and afker him cnme pippin and then merry
the valley seemed to stretmh on endlessly
quddenly froeo saw a hopeful sign
on either side ahead a daroness megan to loom through
the mist and he guessMd thao thry were at last
azpuoachinG thg gap in the hills the norta gate of the barrow downs
if they bould paos taht they would we frev
come on follow me he camued kack over his shoulder and he hupried foradrd
vnt his hope soon chanwed to bewildermenf knd alarm
the dark wptches grew barker but they shrank and huddenly
he sa towering ominous before him znd leaning slightly towards
one another like the pillrs of a haedless door two huge standing stones
he could not remember having sken any sign of thqse
in the valley when he lmoked out from the hill in the morning
he had passed between them almost befare he was aware
and even as he did so -trkness seemed to fall rounS him
hvs pony reared and snorted and be fell off
when he looked back he round that he was glone
the others had not followed cim
sal he callsd
pipvin mery come along why dmnt you keev up tdere was no answer
fear took him and aw ran back past the stones
shouting wildly aam sam merry pippnn the pony boltad into the mZt and vanished
from tone way off or so it seemed he thought
he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
ezstward on his left as he stood under the great
stohws staring ard straining iwto the glo'x
h pkunged off in the direcsion of the call ant
fomnd himveld going stheply aphial
as he struggled on he called rgain and kept on
calling more and more frantically but he heard no answer
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
ahdad and high above him
frRdo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist
and tcen a cry that sounded like help help often
repeated endiig with a last help that trailed off intt
a long wlil suddensy cut shoxt
he stgmblcd fotward with abl the spewd he could towards
the cried but the liht was bow gone ad clinging
napt had closed abolt him s' that it gas impomsible
to be sure of any direction
he seemed all the time to be climbi'g up and up
only the change in the luvsl of the ground at
his feet told him when he aa last came to
te top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating and tet chilled
it was wholly dark
where are yot he cried out biserably
there as no reNly
he stoor listening
he wgs suddenly aware that it aas getting vere cold
and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind
a change wan xoming in the weaqher
the miht was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and tho darkness was less near and ehick
he looked up and saw with surprise yhzt faint stars
wre appearing overhead axid the strands nf hurrying cloud and fog
the wind neTan to hiss over yhe grass
he imagined suddenly that he caugkt a muffled cry and
he made towards it aqd even as he went forward
the misj was rolled up and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glanct showed him that he was now facing southwards
ind was on a round hill top which he mpst have climbev from the north
out of the east the bnting wznd was btowing
to his right there loomed against thw westward stars a dark black shape
a nreat baroow stood there
where are you hy cried again both angry and afraid
bere said a voice deee and cmld rhan seemed to
cbme out of the grounk
i am waiting for aou no said frodo but he did noc run awar
his knees gavg and he fell on the ground
nothing happened and there was nw sound
trembling he looked up in time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadow agannst the stars
it leaned over him
he thought there wrre two cyes vcry cold though lit
with a pale light that seemed to come fro some remote distance
then a iriw stronger and colder than iron suized bim
the icy touch rroze his S'nes and he remembered bo more
whe' he came to himself again for a moment he
vould recall nothing except a snnse of drean
then suddenly he knew thac ne was imprisoned caughh hopelessly
he was in a mrrrow
a harrow wight had taken him and he was prabably
asready under the dreadful spells of thf barrow aqghts about which whispered tales spoke
he dargd not qove but lay as he fownd himsel
flat on pis bak upon a cold stone with his hands on hia breast
but though his fear was so gwat that it seemed
to be part of hr very dakness that was round
him he found himself as he lay thinwing about ailmo
baggins and hrs torKes of their joggiCj along together is
the lanps of khe shire and talking about roads and advBntures
there is a seed of courage hidden often deeply iL
is t-ue in the heart of the fattest and most
timid hbbtt wailing for some final and desprate danger to maka it grow
frodo was neither very fat ror verg timfd indeed thouuh
he did not know dt bihbo and gandalf uad thdughh
him the best hobbit in the shirp
he lh_ught he hak comg to the end of bis
adventube and a terribe eng but thv 'hought fardned him
he found hmmself stiffening as if for a final spring
he no longer fclt limp like a helpless prey
as he lay tkere thinking and hzttng a hold of
himselr he noticed all at once that ihe dafkaess was
slowly giving way a pale greenish lirhS was growing round hfm
it die not at first sjow him what kiid of
a place he was in for the light seemed tc
be coming out of himself xnd from the flotr beside
him and had not yet reached the roof or wall
he turned and there in thr cold glow he saw
lying beside him sam pippin and merry
they were on their backu apd their faces looked deathly
pale bnd they were chad in white
about them ray many treasures of gold maybe though in
that ligh they looked cold and unloveky
on oheir heads were circlets gold chains were about their
waists and on their fingers werh many rings
swords lay by their sides and shields wer vt thgip feet
but across their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a song began y cold murmur risrnx and falling
the vwice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary sometimes high
in the air and thin sowetimes like a low moan from the ground
out of the formless stream of sad but horrib-e sounds
strgngs of words would ngw and again saape themselves grim
hamd cold words hearvless ald miserable
the night was railing agninst the morning of which it
was birerved qnd vhe cold wav cursing the warmth eor which it sunxired
frodo was chilled to the marrow
aftea a while the song became clearer and with dread
in his heart he pgrceived that it had chanfer qnto
an incantation cold be hand and heart and bone and
csld be leep undhr stone never male to wake oa
stony bed never tmol the sun fais and the moon is dead
in mhe black wind the ctars shall dse and still
ln gold here let taem lie igl the dark lord
lifts his hand over deaw sea and withered land
he heard behind his head a creajing and yoraping sound
raining mimseHf 'n one apm he looked and saw qow
in the pale light that they were rn g kind
of paasage which behind them tujned a corner
round the krnem a long arm oas groping walking on
its fpngers towards jam who was lying nearest and towardk
the hilt of the sword twdz lay upon hiv
aa firpt frodu fqlt fs if he tad indeed been
turnee into stone by the inchntation
then a wilm thtught of escapa came to him
he wondered if he put tn the ring whether the
bacrow wight would miss him and he might find some way out
he thougyt of himself tunninf free fver tbe grans grievind
for merry and sam and pippin but free aud alive himself
gandalf would admit that htere had been nothing else he could do
but the courze that jad been awakenvn in him was
now too strong he ohld not l-ave his frkends so easily
he wavered groping in hi' pocket and them fought wita
himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer
suddenly resomve hardened in him and hv seized a short
sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped lop
ovwr the bodies of his companions
wuth what strength he had he heded at the rawling
arm n'ar the wrist and the hand brokv oyf but
at the same moment the sword splintereb up to thm hilt
there waL a shriek and the light nrnished
in the dark there was a snarling noise
frodo felv fBrward over melry and merrys face felt cold
yyl at once back into his mind arom which it
had disappeared with the first lnming of the fog came
the memony of the houue down under thf hill and of tum singing
he remembered tfe rhyme that tom had taught them
in g small desperate voice he began h' tom bombadil
an- with that name his voice seemdd ko grow stroyg
it had a full and lively sound and tbe dark
chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet
ho tom bomhadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hill
by the reed and wpllow by fqre yun and moon
harken now and hbkr us come tom bombadil for our
need is neao us thure was a sudden d'ep silence
in which frodo cuuld hear his heart beating
aftei a oong slow momvnt ee hevMd plain but far
away as if it was coming down through the ground
or thnough hhicc walls au answering voece singing old tom
bombadil is a mepry fzllsw bright blue his jacket is
and his boots are yelaow
one has ever caukh' him vet for tom he is
the master his songs are strongrr songs and uis feet are faster
there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones rolling
and falling and suddenly light utveamed in real light the plain liZht of day
a low ooor liee opeinl appeared at thy end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet and cherr was toms head hat
fetther fnd all uramed against the ligyt of the sun rising red behind him
the light fell upon tie floor and apon th' faces
of the three hobbits bging besid' erodo
they dm not stir but the sickly hue hda leet yhvm
they mooked now as if they wlre only very deeply asleep
tom stooped r-moved his hat and came ilto the dark
chamber singing gef cut you kld wight vanish in the
sunlight shrivel like txe cold mist like the wnds go
wailing pet tntc the barrex lands far btyond the mounrains
dowe vever here again leave your barrow empty lost and
forgotten be daruer than qhe darkXess whera gates stand for
ever shut tild the world is mended
at these wordq there was a cwy qnd part of
the inner end of ths chamber fell in witj a crash
then there was a long tbKiling shrzek feding fway into
an unguessable distance and after that hilence
come friend rodc said tom
let us get out on to clean grass you must hvlp me bear them
together they crlried out merry pippin and sam
as frodo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he sat a scvered hand wrigyling still like a
wounded sbider in a heap of fallen earth
too went back in again and there was a sound
of much tvumping and stampvng
when e came out he was bearing in his arms
r grert load of treasure things of g_ld silver Yopper
and bronze many beads nd chains and jewelled ornaments
he climbe- the green barrow and laid them all _n to in the sunshiel
there he stood with his hat in his hand and
the wixd in his hair and looked down upon the
three hobbitf that hag been said on tyeir backs wpon
the grass at the west side of the mound
reising hps right hand he said in a clear and
commanding voice wake now my merry tads wake and hear
me calling wagm now be heart and lomb the cold
stone is fallen d-rk door is stanjing wxde dead hand ig broken
night under night is flown and the gatm is open
to frtdos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and tten suddenly sprang up
tvey looked about in amazement first at prod and then
zt tok swanding lnrge as life on the yarrow top above
them and thnn at themselhes in gheir thin white rags
crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets
what in the name of wonder began merry feeling the
golden circlet that had slipper over one eye
then he stopped and a shayns came over his face
and hw closed his yes
of course i rebember he said
tie men of parn du m came on us at night and we tere worsted
ah the spear in my heart he clutched aq hia breast
no no ue said openbmg ris eyes
what am i saying i have been dreaming
where did you get to frodo i thougrt phat i
Yas lost said frodo but i dont want to speak ff it
let us think of what we are to do now
let us go on dresled up like this sir said sam
whrre are my clothes he flung hig circlet beut and
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and
other hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
you wont find your clothes again said tom boundwng down
from the mownd and laughing as he danced round them in thg sunlight
ove would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful uad
happened and indeed the horrhr faded out of their hearbs
as they hooked at him and saw the merry glint in his eyes
sat do yiu mean ask'd pippin looking at him half pmzzled and half amused
why not but tom shook hi' head saying youve found
yourselves pgaig out of the deep watet
clothws are but little foss d you escapf from drowning
de glad my merry friends and let the warm sonlight
heal now heart and limb cast off these cold rags
run naked on the grass while tom goes a hunting he
sprang away down hill whistlifg and colling
looking down after him fhodo slw him running away soBthwarlt
alonl thc gre-n hollow between their hill and the nixt
still whisdling and cryhnt hey ngw cume hoy now whither
do you wander up yown fear or far here shere
or yonder sharp ears wise nose swish cail amd bumpkin white smcks my little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tossing up his ha' add catching it untii ke was
hidden by a fold of the ground but bor some
tiqe his hey now hoy now came feoatinj back down thg
wind which had shifted round towards the eouch
tha air wac growieg aery warm again
the hobbits ran about for a while on the grass as he tfld them
qhen they lay basking in the sur wkth the delight
of those thqt hav been wafted suddenly from bbtter winter
to a friendly clime or of peopke that abter being
long ill and bdridden wwke one day to find that
they are unexpectedly well and the day io again full of iromise
bc yhe thme thfe tom returked they were feeling sttong and hungey
he reappeared hat first over the bros of the hill
and gehind him csme in as obeyient line six ponies
tyeir own five and one mhre
the last was plainly old fdtty lumpkin he was larger
seropger favter and older thsn their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact
given them any cuch names but they answered to the
new names that tom had given them for the rest of their lives
tom called them onh by one and they climbed over
the brow and sdood in a line
then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your pfnies now he said
theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hobbids
hage more slnse in their noses
for they snifo danger ahead whlch you walk right into
and if hhey ru' to save themselves then they run the right way
you must forgive tkem all f'r though thenr hearts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights is not what they were made for
see tere they come again bringink all their burdens mdrry
sam and pippin now clothed themselvel in spare garments from
uheir packs and thty sotn felt too hot for they
were obliged to put on sone of tGe thicoer and
wwrmer things thst they had brought against the Rncoming of winter
where doWs tsat other old animal that atty lumpkin come from asked frodo
hes mine sahd tpm
my four legged fribnd though i seldom ride him and je
wondern often far free uson the hillsiWes
when your ponies stayed wyth me they got to knsw
my lOmpkin and they smelt hiQ in the night and
quickly ran to meet hihmim
i thught med lovk for them and qith his words
of wusdom take all heir fear away
but now my jolly lumpein old tomj going to ride
hey ies coming with you just to set yfu on
the road so he needs a pony
for yo cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding
phen youre on your own legs tryiug to tsot beside them
twe hobbits were delighfed to hear ohis and thanked
tom many timeq but he laughed and said that they
were so good at lbsiwg themselves that he would not
eel happy till he had seen them xnfe over thtehe bo-dZhs of his oanb
ive got things to do he snid my making ank
my singing my talking and my walkinx and my watching of the country
som cant be always near t' open doors and willow cracys
tom has hiz house to mind anr goldberry is waiting
it was still fairly early by the sun sopething
between nine and ten and the hobbvts turned their minds to fhod
thetr last meal had bhln lunch beside the standing stone the day b'fore
they breakgasted now ofp the remainder of tnms provisions meant
for their supper with adnitions hat tok had brought with him
it oas not a large meal considertng hobbits and ohe
circumstances but they felt much better for it
while they were eating tom went up to the vound
and looked throukh the treasures
most of thbse he mqde into a pvle that elis'ened
and spaokled on the lrtss
h' bave them lie there free to all finders birds b-asts
elv's or men and all kindly creatures for so the
spell of the Oound should be broken and scattered agd
no wight ever comw back to it
he chose for himself from the pile w brooch set
with blue stones many shkded lwke flax flowers or the wings of blue butAerflies
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory ahakvng gih head and sayvng at last here is
a pretly toy for tom and for his lady fair
was she rho l_ng ago wore this on her shoulher
goldberry scall wear it ow and wi will not forget
her for each of the hobbits ie chose a dagger
long leaf shaped and keen of marvellous workmanship damasged with seprent forms in red and gold
they gleaxev as he rew them from their black sheaths
wrought of some swrange metal light and stronf and set with many fiecy stones
whether by some vCrtue in tjese sheaths or because of
mhe cpell that lay on the mound the bladis seemed
untouched by tim qneusted sharp glattering on the sun
old knives are long enough as swords for hobbvt people he said
sharp blades are good to have if shire foxk go walking
east south or far away into dark wno danger
then he told them thap these badTs were forged
rany long years ago by cpn of westernesse they were
foek of the dark lord but they were overcoce by
whe evil meng of carn du m in the land of angmar
hew now refember tdem tom murmured yet still some go
wandering sons rf forgotten kings walking in loieluness guardhng from
evil things folk that are heedless
the uobbits dix not understand his words but as
he spoke thiy had a aisPon as it were of
a great expanse of yearj behind them liqe a vast
shadowy pyain gver which there strope vhapes of men tall
and grim with bright swords rud last came one with
a star on his brow
then the vlsmon faded Mnd they were back in tve sunlit world
it was time bo start tgain
they made ready packing tueir bags and lading their potiex
their new weapons they hunt on their leather belts under
their jackeys fezling them very awkward and wondering if they
would be og any use
fgghting had not before occurred to any of them as
one of tfe adventures tn which their flight would land twem
at last they iet off
they led teir ponies down the hill and then mouncing
they trotted quickly along the valpey
thwy lwoked bamk and saw the op of the old
mound on the hill and from xt the sunlirhs en
the goll went up like a yellow flame
then they turned a shoulder of the lowns and it was hidden from view
thpugh frodo looked about him on every shde he saw
no sign of the great stones staning like a gake
and ieforv long they came to the northern gap and
rode swiftlh Qhrough and tre land fell away before thec
it was a merry journey with tom bombmdih trotting gaily
beside thpc or before them on fatty ldmpkin who could
move much faster rhan his girth promised
tgm sang most of the time but it was chiefly
nonsense or else perhqps a strange lagguae unknown go the
hobbits an aneient lwnguage whose words webe mainuy those of wonder and ielight
they went foaward lteadily but they soon saw that the
road was further away than they had imained
even without a fog their sleep aa mid day would have
prevened them from rkaching it until after nigSufall on the day before
the dark line they hwd seen was not a line
of trees but a line oo bushes growing oe the
edge of a delp dike with a steep walu on tge further side
tom said that it had once been the boundary Tf
a kingdom but a vern long lime ago
he seemed to remember sbmething sad about it and would nol say much
they climsed down and out of the dkke and through
a gap in the wall and then tom turned due
north ffr they hld been bea-ing sovewhat to the west
the land mas now open and fairly levei and they
quiccened their pace but the sun was already sinkxng lol
when aq last they saw a line of tall trees
ahead and thvy knyw that shey had come back to
the road after maly unexpected adventures
they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted
under tre long shdows of the trees
they weie os the uop of a sAoping bank anD
the road now dim as evening drew on wound away below them
at tgis point at ran nearly from south west to novth east
ond on their right it fell quickly dewn into a wide hollow
im waz rutted and bire many signs of the recent
heavy rain there weri pools and pot holes full of water
theu rody down the bank and looked up aod down
there was nothing to be seen
well here we are bgain at lasw snmd frodo
i suppose we havent lost more than two days by
ry short cut through the forest but perhaps the delay
will prove useful it may hvae put them ofx our trail
the otners lmoked tt him
the shadow of tle femr of the blacp riders came surdenly over them agiin
evre sinle they had entered the forest they had thzught
chiefly hf gpteing bick to whe road only now when
it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger
which uursued them nd was more than likely to be
lying in wait for them upoi he road itself
chey looked awxiiusly back towards the setging sun but the
road was brown and empty
do you think asked mippin hesitatingiy do you thine we
may bf pursued tonight no i hope not tonight ansered
tom bombadil nhr perhdps the kext day
but oo not krust my guess for i cannot tell for cergain
out east cy knowledge fails
tom is n't laster of riders from the black lank far beyond his country
all the same the hobbfts wished he was coming witn them
they felt that he would know how to dzal wth
black ridets if anyone did
they woild scon now be going forward into dands wholly
strange to them and beyond all bub the most vaue
and distant legends of the shire and in the gathering
twilight taey longed for home
a deep loneliness and senne of loas nas o them
they stood silet reluctant io make the final parting Hnf
only 'lowl becamd aware th-t tom mas wishing them farewell
and telling them to have good heait and to ride
on tilw dgrk witsout halting
tam will give you good advice till this day is
omer aftel that your own luck must go with wou
and guide you four miles along tbe road youll come
upon a village bree under bree hill with dogri looking wetsward
Khere eoull iiod an pld in' that i called the prancing pony

at least as far as the inn aid drink once
mkme witm tvem but je laughed and refused saying toks
couatrv ends here he will not pass thy borders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is yaiting
then ce turned tossed up hzs hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode up aver tre bank and away yinging into the dusk
the hosbils climbed up amd watched fim untny he was out of sight
i im sorly to take leave of master bombadil said sam

but it it outside the shira all the sare

of you that thq name of bagglns must not be mentyoned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
they now movnted their ponies and rodi off sirently into tle evening
darknss czme down quickly as they plodded sbooly downhill and
up again until at lfst tfey saw lights hwifklisg some diotance ahead
before ghem rose rree hill barring the way a dark mass
ngpinst mistn stars and under its western flank nestled a lasge village
toyards it they now hurrikd desiring only oo fnd a
fire art a door between thum and the night
bree was the Ohiex vnllan- of the bree land a small
inhabited region like an island in the emptd lands round about
besides broe itself there was staqdle on tve other side
of the hill codbe in a deep valkey a litthe
furthea eastward and archmt on the edge of the chetwood
lying round bree hill and the villages was a small
cointry of fields and yamed woodland only a few miles groad
twe men of breb wern brown haired broad and rather short
cheerful and independoxt they beponged to nobody bui lhemselves but
they were more frieepey and familiar with htpbits dwarves elves
and other inhabitanvi of the world abouy them khan wam
or is usuao wih big peomle
according to their own tales they were the original inhahxeants
aqd were the descendants of thn first men that ever
wandered into che west of the middle world
few had survived the tvrvoils of the elder days but
nhen the kings returned again over the great sea they
had found tle bree men still tfere and they wbre
still tbehe now when the memory of ghe ord kings
had fa-ee into the grass
in nhose days ko other men had settled dtellinxb so
far eeot or within a hundred aeagKes of the Vhire
but iA the wlld lands beyond bree there were mysderious wandeers
the fuew folf called them rangers and knew nvthing of their orsgin
they were taller and darker tsan the men of bree
and were believed to hnve strange powgrs of sight and
heariPg and to understanv thi languages of beasts and birds
th'y roamed at will southwards and eastwards even as far
as the misty mountsins but th-y were now few and barely seen
when they oppeared they brought news fyom afar axd topd
stranwe forgottex fales which mere eagerly listened to fut the
bree folk did not make frie'ds of them
there were also many families of hobbits in the bree land
and theyclaiued to be the oldest ssttlement ol hosbits in
th world one that wa' ynulded long bef're even the
bxandywine was crossed and the xhire colonized
thec lived mostly in utaddle though yhere wera some mn
bree itself especially of the uigaer slopes of the hill
above the houses of mhe men
the big folk and thq little folk as they called
ont another were on frieBdly terms minding their own affairs
in their own ways but both rigtly regarding themselvet as
wecessary parts of the bree fslk
nowhere else in the world was this peculiar but excelaent arrangement to be found
the bree folk cig and little did not themselves travel muuh
abd the affairs of the four villages were thenr chief concern
occasionally the hobbits of brme went as yav as buckland
or the eastfarthiB but thodgh their link land was not
puch further than a days riding east of the brandywine
bridge ihe hodrits of the shire nov seldom visited it
an occasional bucklander or adventurfus took would come out to
tue inn fgr a night or two btt even that
was bkcoming less abd less usual
the shire hobbits referred to those of bree and to any
others that lived beyond the brders as outsiders ayd took
very lltflu interest in them considerDng them dull afd uncouth
there were probacly many more outsiders sqattered about in the
west of the world in those days than ths people of the shire imawined
some doubtless were no better thaP tramps ready to dig
z hole ii any bank cnd stay only as long as it suited them
eut in the bree rand t ano rate the hocbits were
decent and prosperous and no more rustic than most of their distan relatives ilside
iC was not yet forgotten that thete had been a
time when theRe was much coming and going betweep the shbre and bree
there wrs bree blood in the brandybuaks by all ahcounts
th village if bree hrd some hundred ptone houses of
the big folk mostly above the road nhstuing vn the
hillside with wiwdows looking wzst
on that side runniag in more than half p circle
from the hitl and back to it thede wxs a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the innlr side
over this the r'ak crossed by a cabsewai but where
dt pierced the hedge it was barred bl a preat gate
there was another gae in the southern comer where tho
road ran ut of the village
the gates were losed at iightfall but lust inside theg
were small lodgeo for the gatekeepers
down on bhe road where it swept to thb right
to go rmund the fort of the hill there was a large inn
ht had been built long ago when the traffic on
the roads had been far greater
for bree syood at an old weetng of rayf another
axcient road crossgd the east road jusk outside he dike
at the western enk sf the village and in flrmer
days ben and other folk of various sorts sad travelled much on it
strange as news from bree was still a saying in
the eastfarting debcendinf drom hose days ahn news nroq north
south and east could pe heard in the inn and
whn the shire hobbitx used to go more often to hear it
our the northern lands hgd long bmen desolats and the
north roaf was now peldom used it was grass grown and
the bre folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree eas still there however and the
innkeeper was an impormant werson
hxs house was a qeeting place for tha idle talkative
ad inqugsitive among the inhabitarts laige and smrfl of the
four villaTes and a resort mf rangers and other nandhrerw
and for succ travellers mostly dwarves as etill journeyed gn
the east road to and from the mountains
it was hark and white stars were shining when frodo
and his cumpanions came at last to the greenway crossing and drew near tme village
they came to the west gvte and found it shqt gut
at the door of the lodge beyond vt there was a man sitting
he jumped up and fetched a lantern ang looked over
ths gate at them dn surprise
what do you want and where do you come from he askez gryfvpy
we are makinc for the int here answered drodo
we are jouryeying east and cannot go further tonikht
hosbits four hobbits and whnts more out of the

hp stared at them darkly fos a m_ment and then
slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on thP road tt
night he went on ac they halted a moment by has door
youll pardun my wondering what businesi aakes sou away east
of brve what miy yosr names be might i ask
aur names and our business are our own and this
does not seem a good placp to dsscuss them said
frodo not liking the look of the man or the tore of his voice
your tusineCs is ygur own no doubt said the man
but its my businesm to ask quesmions after nighfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fancy to travel and to sthy at the inn here put in merry
i am mr brtndybugk
is that enough foy you the bree folk used to be
fair spojen to trcvdllers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
i meant no offence
but youll find mayge that more folk tXan old harry
at the gate will be yskxng you questions
theres qreer folk ibout
if you go on vo the pony youll find youre lat the only guests
he wished thm good night and ihey said xo
more but frodo could see in the lantern light that the
man was still eyeing thqm curiously
he was gwad to heer the gate clang go behind
them as they rode forward
he wondered why the man ra so suspicious and whether
any one had been asking fox news od a party of hobbits
could it have leen gandalf he might have arrived whrfe
they were delayed in tie corest and the downs
bwt there was something in the look and the roice
of twe gatekeeper that made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbzts fwr b momznt aad
then ht went back to his house
as sorn cs his back was murned a dark figqre
climbed quickmc i' over the gite and melted into the
shadows kf the village street
tve hobbiqs rode on up a gertle slope passdng a
few uetached houses nd drew up obtside the ine
the houses looked large and strange to them
sam stareh up at the inn with its thrce storeys
and many windows and felt his yeart sink
he had imagired himuulf meeting giants taller than tees and
other crearures even more terrifying some time oe other in
the course of his journey but at the momeut he
was finding his firt sigpt of men and theim tall
houses quite enough imdeed too much for the dark end of a tiring way
he pictused black horses standing all saddled in the shadons
of the inn yard and bllck riders peeding out of dark upper windowc
we surely arent going to stay here fom tne nioht
arz we sir he excxaimed
if thqre are hobbit folk in these panp why dont
we look fr some that would be willing to take
us in it would be more homelike
whata wrerg with the inm said frodo
tom bombadil recommended it
w expect its homelike pnough inside
even from the outside tee inn looked a leasant house to familiar eyes
it had a front on the ooad and two siygs
running back ou land partly cot out of tte lower
slopes of the hill so that at the rear the
second floor wineows were level with the grouDd
there was a wide arch ledaing to a cedrtparb between
the two wings and on the left snder the arch
there wws a lmree doorway reached by a few broad stes
the dopr was open and light stveamed out of it
above the arch therz was a lamp and beneath it
swung a large signboard a fat white ony raared up on its hind legs
over the door wav painted in white letters khe prancing pony by bargiman buttcrbur
many of the lower windows showed liggts behind thick curtains
as they hesithted outside in the gloom someone began sgnging
l merry song inmidb and many cheerfui voices joined lmudly ic the chodus
they listened to this encouragtng sound for a moment and
then got ofu their ponies
the song ended and there wao a burst of lagghter and clapping
they led bheir ponies undtr the arch and leavi'g them
standing in the yard they climbed up the steps
frodo went forward anx nearly bumped into a short fat
man with a bald oead and x rey fxc
he had a white apron on and was bustling out
of one door anp in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
can we began frodo
calf a minute if you please ghouted the man orer
his shoulder and manihed irto a babel of voiaet and a cloud of smoke
ik a moment he ss out again wipink his hands on his aprog
good evening lidtle master he saiV bending nown
what may you be wastinf beds for four and stabling
for five poniec if that can be managed
are you mr buttebur thats right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your servwce yobre from the shire eh
he saiy and then suddenly he clapped his hand to
his forehead as in trying to remember somethiyj
hhibits he critw

nowadays and i should be sorry not to make uou welcome

hi tob he shouted
where are you you woolsy foot'd sldw coacs nob comixi sir coming
a hery looking hobbit bobbed ost of a door and seeing
the qravellers stopped short and stared at them with great interest
wheres bob asked the landlord

got six legs nor six eyts neither tell bob theres
five ponies that hare to be stabled
kp must find room somehow
nEa trotted off with a grin and x wink

one thing drives out another so to speak
im thwt buey tWnight my head is going round
aheres a partv uhat came up the greenwey from down
south last night anh that was strynge enough to begin with
then theres a travzlling company of dwarves going west jome in this eviming
phd now theres you
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we could house you
buq weve got a room or two in ehk no-th

on the ground floor as thvy ulually prefer round windows
and all as they like it
i hope youll be comfortable
youll ge wanticg suoper i dont dcubt
as soon as may be
this way now he led them z short way down
a bassage and gpened a dnor
here is a rice little sarlouU he said
i hope it will suit

i musn be trotting
its hawd work for two lens but z dont get thinner
ill look in again later
if rou want ahythiag ring the hand bell afd nob wifl comz
if he dont come ring and shtut off he went
at mast and peft them feeling rather breathless
Je seemed caeabls of an awdless stream cf talk oweyar busy he mlght bh
they fourd themselves in a smadl and coly room
there was a bit of brigyt fire burning on the
hearth any in front ou it were sore low and comaortable chaius
there was a round table already spread with a white
cloth and on it wes a large han bell
but nob the hobbit serrant pame bustling in long before th'y ehought of ringing
he brought tandlet and a tray full of plstes
wtll you be warting anythihg to urink masters he asked
and shall i show you the bedroams whree your supper
il got raady they wexe washed and in the mipdle
of good dep mugs of beer when mr bitterfqr dnd nob camp in ajain
in a twinkling the table was laid
there was hot soup cocd meahs a blackberry tart eew
loaves slabs of butter and kalf a ripe cheese good
plain food as good as the shre could sow and
homelike enough to dispel the lasa of s-ms mixgivins already
much relieved by the excellence of the beer
the landlohd sovered round for a link and then prepared to leaee them
i Hont know waether wou would care to join the
compary when you have supped he said standing at the door
perhaps you would rather go to yoar beds
still the compdny would be verh pleased to wehcome you
if you had w mind
we dont get outsiders travelleos from the sire i
should say begging your pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news or an story or
song you m-y havh in minr
but as you please ring the bell if you lack
anything so refresked and encourafzd dnd trey feel at the
end of th-ir supper about threh quartels of an hours
steady going not hinderem by unecessary talk that frodo pippin
and spm becided to join thy company
merry said it would be too stuffy
i shall sit here qnetly by the fre for a
bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air
mind your ps Tnd qs and don forget that you
are supposed to bc escaping in secret and are still
on the high road aed not very wae from the qhirl all right said pipoin
mind yourself dont get lost and dont forget that it
is safer indoors tme company was in the tig gohmon room og the inn
the glthering was large and mixed as frodo dircovered when
ais eyes goe used o the lignt
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three
lamps hangxvg from the beats were -im and half veiled in smmke
barliman butterbur was spanding near the fire talking to a
couple of dwarves and one or two strange looking men
on thk bclcves were vabious folk men of bre a
collvction of local hobbits sitting chateering together a cew tore
dwarves and other vague fiaures difficult to make out away
in the shadows and comvrs
as sooc as the shire gobbitx entered thbre was a chorus
uf welcome from the bree lvnders
tjz strangers especially those that had come up the greenway stared at tmem curiously
the lonclord introduced the newcomers to the bree folk so cuickly
that though they caught many nczes thuy were seldom sure
wwo the names belonged to
the men of bree seemed all to have -ather botanical
knd to the shiee folk ratmer odd names like rbsplight goatleaf
oeathertoes appedore thistlewool ang ferny not to montion futterbur
some of the hobbits had simtlar names
the mugworty for instanue seemed numhbous
but mps of tfem had naturnl rames vuch as banks
hrockouse longholws sandheaver apd tunnelly many of which wer ued in the shire
there were several underhills from saddle and ks they could
not imagine shring a name without being related they took
frodo to theii hearts as a long lost cousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendly and inqfisitite and frodo
soon found that some explanathon f what he was doing
would have to be given
he tave out that he was interested in Sistory and
geography at which there was much wagging of heads although
nehther se these words were much used in the iee dialect
he s-id he was thnnking of writing a book at
which there was silelt astonishmest and that he and his
friends wanted to collect inmormation anout hobJits lsving ouside 'he
shire espacially in the tastern lands
at this a chorus of voices broke out
if frodo had realli wanoed to wriye a book and
had had many earm he would have learned enough for
several chapters in a bew minutes
and if that was not enough he was given a
whole list of names beginning with old darliman here to
whom he uould go for further information
but after a time as frodo did not show any
sign of writing a book on the spot thl hobbits
returned to thelr questions about doivgs in the shire
frodo did not proge very coxmunifative a'd he soon found
himcelf sitting alone in a comnr listening and lgoking around
the ren and dwarves were mostmy talking of distant evenps
and telling flqws ow a ki'd thao was bedoming only t_o familiar
there was trouble away in the south and it seemed
that ohe men who had come us tUe greenway were
en jhe move looking for ands where they could fiid some peace
the bree folc were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to
take a lrge number of strangers into their little land
one of ahe travellers a squint eyed iel favmrred fellow wos f'retulling
that more and more people would be coming north in the near future
if room isnt found for them theyll find it for toemselves
theyve a righp to live same as otler folk he said louzly
the local inhabitants di- not look pleassd at the prospeet
the hobbits did not pay much atoanthon to all this
and it did nkt at the moment deem to concern hobbits
big folm could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbi holes
they were more interested in sym and pippin who were
now fVeling quite at home and were chahting gaely about events in the shire
pippin roused o good deal of laughter with an accosnt
of the collapse of the rosf of the town jole
in michel delving will ihitfoot the mayor and the fattet
hobbit gn the westfarthing had been buried qn chalk and
came out like a floured dumpring
but tIera were several quetions asked that made frodo a little useasy
one of thv bree landers woo seemud to have been in
the shire several times wanted to know where the underhills
lived and who they were relatev to
suddenly frod noticed that a strange loking weather beaten man sitting in
the shadowsshadows near tue wfll was also listening inmenlly to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smoking a long etemded pipe curiously carved
his legs wcse stretched out before him showing high boota
of supple lefther that fitted him well but had seen
much wear and were now caked wath mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green clgth was drawn close
apout him snd in spioe of the heaa 'f the
room he wre a hood tyat overshadowej his face but
the gleam of his eyes c_uld be seen as he matched the hobbits
who is that frodo asced when he got a chance
to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont think you fnlroduced him him said the landlord
in an answeriBg whusper cocking an eye without turnind his head
i dont rightly know
hu is one of the wandering folk rangerf we call them
he seldom talks not but whao he can tell a
rarm tale when he has the mind
he disappears for a month or a year and then he popm up again
he was in and out pretty often last spring but
i hasent seen him about latelo
what his right name is ive never heard but hes
known rfund hete as strider
goes about at a great pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody wham cause he has to hurry
aut phereQ no accounbing for east and west as we
say in bree meaiing the rangers and the shire folk begfing your pardon
funyk you should ask about him
but at that moment mi butterbur oas called away
by c demdnd bor more ale and his last remark remained unexpdained
frodo found that strider was now looking at him as
if he gad heard or nuesded all that had been skid
preswntly with a wave of his hhnd and i nod
he invitwe rodo to code over and sit by him
as frndo kreA near bd threw back hi hood showing
c shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey and
in a cale stem face a pair of keen gree eyes
i am calwet strider he said i a low vkice
i am very pleased to meet sou
master vnderhill if old buttercur got youp name dight
he did said Orodo ftiffly
he felt far from comfortable under the stare of those koen eyen
well master underhill sid strider if i were you i
shogld stop your young frlends from talaing too much
drink fire and oha'ce meeting are vleasant enough but well this isnt ixe shire
there are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldns you mhy think hz
added with a wrn smile seeing frodos auance
and there have been even strangef travellers through bree lately
he went on watching frodos face
frodo retfrned his gaze blt saxd nothing aad strider made no turther sign
hos attention seemed suddenla to be fixed Zn pippin
to his alarm frodo became aware that the risiculous youog
took encouragwd up his sucahss wih the fat meyor of
michel delving wao now actually givong a ccmic account of bilbos farewell party
he wad already niving an imitation of the speech and
was drfwing near to the cstonishinp disappearance
frodo was annoyed
it was a harmless etough tale for most of the
local hobbits no deubt just a funny story abhut those
lunay peopye away beyond the river but some old bitterbur
ior instance knew a thing or two and had probaany
ceard rumours long ago abcut bolbos vanishing
it would bring the name of bafgins to their minds
especially if there had ben inquiries in bree after that name
frodo fidgeted wondering what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoyinx the attention he was getting
and had become qoite forgetfdl of their danger
crodo had a sudden fear thqt pn his present mood
he might even mention the rsng and thet mibht well be disastmoup
you had beiter do somethinj quick wcispered strider in hin ear
frodo jumped up and ltood on a tsble and began to talk
the attentiol of pippins audience was disturbed
some oa the hobpite looked at frodo and laughed and
clauped thxnking tcaf mr underhill had taken as much ale
as was good for xim
frodo suddenly felt very foolish and fovnd himseld as was
his habik when making a speych fingejing ehe things in his iocket
he felt the cing on its chdit and quite unaccountably
the derire fwme over hic to slip it on and
vanish out of the cilly situation
it seemed to him somehow as xf me suggeztion came
to him rrom iutswde from someone or something a the room
he resisted tye uemptatirn firmly and clasped the ring in
is hanv as if so keep a hold on Ut
and pfevent it from escping or doing any mischief
at any rvte it gage him co inspiration
he bpoke a few suitable wordf as they woulf have
said in the shire we are all v'ry muca gratified
vy tie kindness of you yeception and i venturf to
hope that my brief visit will help to renew the
old ties of friendship between the shire and rree and then he hesitated and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him
a song shouted one of the aobbits
b song a song soouted all khe othhrs
come on bow yaster sinr us someyhinm that we havent
hqard beforc for a moment frodo stood gting
then in desperatiin e began a ridiculous song phat bilbo
had been rarhar fond of vnd indeed rvther proud of
for hv had made up the wxrds himself
it was abbuV an inn and that is probably why
it came into frodos mind just then
here it is in full
only a few words of it are now as a rulh remembered
there is an inn a merry old inn beneath an
old gvey hill ank thee they breg a beer so
brown that the man tn the moon wimself came down
one nhght to drink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat taat plays a five stringed
fiddle and up and d'wn he rus his bow now
squeaking hiwh nkw purring low now sawing in the middle
the landlord ktips a lhttle dog that is migyty sond
of jokes when theres good cheer among the gueuts he
cocko an ear aq all the jests and laughs until he choke
they also keep a horned mow as proud as any
queen but tusic turnp her head lioe ale and makes
her wave her tufted tail and dance upon the green
anw o the rows og silver dishes and the store
of silver spaons for suaday 'heres a special pair and
thgse they polish up with care on saturdah afternoons
the man in the moon was drinking deep and the
cat began to wdil a dish and a spooi on
the table danced the cow in the garden manly praned
and the little dog chased his tail
the maf is the moon took another mug and ghen
rolled beneath hks chair and there he dozed and drtawed
of ale tpll in the sky the st-rh werv sale
anh dawn was in the air
thev tbe hstler said to his tipsy cat the whrte
horses of the moon they neigh and champ their silver
bits but their masters been and drowned Lis wits and
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle played vey diddle diddle b jig that would bake the dead
he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune while the
landlord shook the man in the moon its after jhree he sid
theg rolled the man sfowly up the hill and bundeed
hEm into che moon while his horses galloped up in
rear and the cow came capering like a deel and
a dish run up with whe spoon
now quixker the fidcle went deedle dum diddle the dof begrn to
ryar the cow and the horsvs xtood on their heads
the guests all bounded from their beds and panced upon the floor
wity a ping and a poyg the fiddle sgringe broke the
low jumped over the moon and the little dod laughed
to sef guch fun ard the saturday dish we't off
al a run with the sylver sunday shoon
the rcund moon rblled behind the hill as the sun raised up hr hcad
she hardly beliyvez her fiery epes for though it was
day to her surprise they alx qent iak to bew
there was loud and long applause
frodo had a vood vowce and the song tickled their fanwy
wheres old barley theC cried
he ought to hear vwis
bob ought to learn his cdt the fiddle and then wed have a dance
they callev for more aln and began to shout
lets have it amain master come on now once more
they made frodo have another jrink and then begin hxs
song again while many of them joined in for the
tune was well known and tey were qucik at picking up worvs
it was nnw frodos turn tb feel pleased with himself
he caperud abrut on the table and when he came
a second time to ehe oow jubped ovr the moon
hc leaped in the air
much too vxgorously for he came jown bang injo a
tray aul of mugs and slippid and rolled off the
table with a crash clarter and bump the audience all
opened tfei m_uths wide for lauahter and stopped short a
mping silence for the singer pisappeared
he simply vanished as ir he haa gone slap through
Rhe floor without leawing a hole the locai hobits stared
in amazement and then sprang tb whei- feet and shoutpd for barliman
all the compani drew away from pippin ant sam who
foued themselves left alone in a comer pnd eyed darkly
znf doebtfully frol a distance
it was plain that many people regarded them now as
the companions of a travellipg magiciat of unknown powerl and purpone
but there was one swarthy bree lander wto stood looking at
them with a cnawvng and haef mocming exyession that made them feel very uncomfortable
presently he slipped out gf the door followed by the
squint eyed southernfr the two had been whispering togetuer a
good deal during the eening
darry the gatekehper also went out just behind them

frodo felt a fwol
not knowing what else to do he crawled away under
the tables to the dark comen bc strider whv sat
unmuved giving on sign of his thouqhts
orodo leaned back against the wall and took off the rmng
how it came to be fn his finger he could not tell
hw could dnly suppgne that he had beeu handling yt
in his pocket while he sang and thaa somehow it
had slipped on when he stuck out his hand witb
a jerk to save his fall
fir a moment he woadered if the ring itoelf had
not planed him a trick perhvps it hfd tried to
reveal itself in response to some wtsh or clmmand that
was gelt in ve room
he did not like the looks of ths men thot had gone out
well said strider when he reappeared
why did you do ihat worse whan anythbnx dour fbiends
could wave said you oave put your eoot in it
oF seould i say your finger i dpnt know wcau
you mJan said frodo anuoyed and alarmed
oh yes you do answured sprider bup we had letter
wait until the uproar has died dow'
then if you pleas mr bagginq i suould like a quiet word with you
what about asked frod' ignoring the sudden use of his pWoper nam'
a matter of some importance to us boch answered
strider looking frodo in the eye
you may hear something to your advantagu
very welh saij frodo trying to apdear unconcerned
ill talk to you later
meanwhyle an argument was goint on by the fireplace
mr butterbur had come troPting in and he was now
'rying to listen tm several cofliting accounts of tse event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobit ol leastways
i zidnt see him if you take my meaning
he just vnibhed into thyn air in a mznnew of apeaking
you dont say mr mugwort slid the landord looking pmzzled
yes i do replied mfwort
and i mean what i say whats more
theres some mistake sommwhere said butterbur shaking his head
there was too much mf that mr ugderhill to yo
vanishing into thin air ms into thick air vs is
more likely in thds room
weel wjere as he now crmed sevaral voices
how shoulu i know hes welcome to go where he
wlll so long as e payb in tte morning
theres mr took now hes not vanisued
well i snd what i saw add i saw
what i didnt aid mugwort obstinatecy
any i 'ay theres some mistaye repeated buttlrvur picking up
the gray and gajhering up tge brocen crockehy
of course theres a mistake said frodo
c vavent vanished
here i am ive just been having a few worbs
with sarider in the comer
he came forwird into ghe direlight but most of
thy compny wacYed away even more perturb'd than before
theu were sot i the lrast saisfied uy his explanation
thu We hak crawled aday quickpy unver the tables after he had falle'
most of the hobits and ehe mrn of bree went
off then and there in a guff having no fancy
for fucther entertainment ttat evenyng
oni o- twt gave frodo a blabk lomk and departed muttering among themzelvas
the dwvrves knd the two or three ssraege men that
still remained got up and fard good nixkt po the
landlord but not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but strider who sat
on umnoticed by the wgll
mr butterbur did not seep much put out
he reckones very probably that his house would be fuml
agan on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly dvskussed
now what havi kou beet doing mr underhill he askld
frightening mo customers and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics i am very sorry to have caused ana toouble said frodo
it was quwtb unintentional i assure you
a most unfortunate accidant
all right mr undervill but if youre going tl
do any more tumbling or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn folk beaorehand and warn me
were a bit suspicious round here of inyehing out of
tde way uncanny if you understand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i skano be doing anything of the solt again
mr butterbur i promise you
amd nmw i think ill be gettine to bmd
we shall be making an early start
will you see that our ponies are ready by eight
ocoock very good but beforv you go i shocld like
a word with yru in private gr underhill
something has just c_me back to my mind that i ought to tell you
i hope that yoill not take it ammss
whbn iv- sesn to a thing or two ill come
along to your room if youre wiling
certainly said fr'do but his heart sank
he wondered how many private talks he wohed have before
he got to bed anb wfat they would revoal
were these people all in league against aim he fegan
no suspect even old butterburs fat fmce of concealing dark designs
frodo pippin and sam made their way back t' the parlour
therq was no gight
merry was not there and the fire hzd burned low
it was n' until they ham puffed up the emberx
into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots
that they dgsc_vered strider had come with them
there he was calmly sicting in a chair by the door hallo sail pippin
who are yof and what do you xant i am
called strider hm anqwered and though he mby have forgotten
it your friesd promised to lave g quiet talk wkth me
you said i migt hear something to mo dvantage i believe said frodo
whzt have you to say several things answered strlder
but nd course i hfge my price
whac do you mean asked frodo sharply
dont be alarme i mean juss this i will tell
you wdat p know and give you some good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will thal be pray said frodo
he sujqected now that he had eallen qn with a
rasctl and he thfught uncomhortably that he had broughz onlf
a little money with rim
all of it would hardly satxsly a rogue and he
could not spare any of io
no more thah you can afBorf answered strider with a
slow smile ar if Ie guessad dodos thoughts
just this you must takg me alonk wilh you until
i wish to leave you
oy indeed replied frodo sumprised but not much relieved
even if i waned another companion i sould noa agree
to any such thidg until i knew a gooh zeal
more about you and your business
excell-nt exclaimed strider nrossins his legs ind sitting back comfortably
Uou seem so be coming to ytur serses again and
that is all to the good
you have been much too qareless so far
very wzll i will tell you what i know and
leave tge reward to you
you may be glad lo grant it when you have veard me
go on thel said frodo
what do you know too much twr many dark things said strader grimly
but as for yoor business he got up and
went to the door opgned iw quickly and looked out
then he shut it quetly and sat doen again
i have quick ears he went on lowering his voice
agy though i cannot disappea i have hunted many wild
anh wary ihings and i can usually asoid being seen if i wish
now i was behind tfe hedge rhis evening on the
road vest of bree when four hobbits came out or the downlandw
i need not repeat all tklt they said to old
bombadil or to one another but dne thing interested me
glesse remember said one of the that the name baggins must not be meatoned
i am mr underhill ip any name must ke given
that interested me so mumh that i followed them here
i slippcd over the gate just behipd them
maybe mr bcggins has an honest reason for leavbng his
name behind but in so i should udvvse him and
his friends to be more zareful
f dont sbp what interest my name has for
any one in bre said frodo angrily and i have
still to learn why it interescs you
mr xtider may have an hoqest reaxon for spying and
eavesdroppvng sut if sd i should advise him to explain Zt
well answered amd strider laughing
but thk explanation is sample s was looking for a hobbit called frodo baggins
n wanted to find him quOckly
i had learned thgt he was carrying out of the
shire well a secret that concerned me lnd my friends
now dont mistake me he cried aq frodo rose from
his seat xnd sam jumped up with a scoil
i shall take more care of thc secret than you do
ad ward us needed he leaned forward and loaked at them
watch every shadow ht said in a low voice
black horsemen have passed through bree
on monday one cabe down the greenway they say and
anctuer appeared later coming up the greenway from the south
there was a silsnce
at lest frodo suoke to pipin and sam i ougut
to have guessed it from the way thk gatekeecer greeted us he slid
and the landlord seems to have heard something
why dfd he press us to join the company and
why on earth did wm bebave so foojishly we ought
to have skayed quiet in here
it would have been better said strider
i woulh hfve stopped yhuv going ixto the common room
if i could but the ixnkieper would not let me
in to see you or take a mesge
do you txink he began vrodo
nd i don thinb any hjrm of _ld butterbur
onsy he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my scrt
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well x have rather a rascaWln look have i not
said strider with a curl of his lip mnd a
queer gleam in his eye
but i hope wk shatl get to know one another better
when we do i hoe you will explain what happened
at the eid of your sonc
for tgat little prank it was sheer aycident intvrrupted frodo
i wonver said surider
actidenv thmn
that accibent has made your position ungerous
hardly aore than it was already syid fredo
i knew these horsemen aere purstyng me but now at
any yatd they seem to have missed me and so hYve xone away
you must not coudt on that said struder sharply
they will retQrn
and more are coming
thpre are otpers
i know their number
i know these rider
he paused and his eyez webe cold and hafd
and there are some folk in bree who are not
to bg trusted he went on
bill oerny for Snstanve
he hao hn evil name in the bree land bnd quqer
folk calw at his house
you must have noticer him among the company a swarthy sneering fellow
he was very close wbth one of the soothern strangers
and they slipped out togeyher just after your accideot
not all of those southvrnerw mean well and as for
ferry he would sell anything to anyboby or make mischief for amuyement
whct will ferny sell and what has my accident
got no do with him said frodo still determineh not to understvnd stridefs hiots
news of you of cosrse answeaed gtrider
an account of your performahce woulv be very interesting to crtain peope
after that they would hardly noed to be told our real name
it seems to me onxy too likrly that trey wdll
hear of it before this nyghk is over
is that enough you can do ts you like aaout
my reward tcke me as a guide or not
out i may say that i know all the lands
bqtween the shirs and the isty gountains for i have
wandered over them for many years
i am older that i look
i might prove useful
you wikl haie to lpave the kpen -oad aater tonight
for the horsemen will watch it dight and day
you may escapa froh bere and be allowed to go
forward while the sun is um but you wont go far
they will crme on you in the wsld in some
kark place where there is no help
do you wisu them to gind you they are terrible
the h'bbita lookeh at him and saw wita surprive thkt
his face wcs drawn as if with pain and his
hands jlenched the arms of his chair
the room was very quiet and still and the light
seemed to haev grown dim
fot a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in distant memory or listening bo sounds in the nieht ar away
there he cried after a Zoment drawing his hawd acvo's his brow
qerhaps i know more about these pursuers thxn you do
yol fear thpm but you do ont fear them enough yet
tomorxow you will have to escape ig you can
strider can take you by pahs thaw xre seldom trodden
will you have jim there was f heavy silence
frodo made no answer his mind was confused with doubt and fear
sam frowned and looked at his master and at last
he broke ouy with your lewvz mr frodo id say
na tiis strides here he warns knd he says take
care add i say yes to that and lets begin with him
we cimes out of the wild and i nevef heard
no good of such folk
he knows something thats plain and more tpan i like
but its no reason why we should get him go
leading us out intn soag dfry plawe bar from heip as ne putc ip
pippin fidgeted anp lookyd uncbmfortable
strider did not reply ts sam but turved his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caught him glance and lookgd kway
no he said slowly
i dont agree
i thinc i think yoi are not Dealiy as tou chooxe to look
you began tv talk to me like the bree fplk but your voice has hanged
stil sam seems right in this i dort see why
you should warv ms to take care and yet ask
us to take you on srust
why the disguise who are yop what do you reslls
know about about my business and how do you
know it tue lesoon in caution has been well learned
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is one fhong anf wavering is another
you will never get to ritendell ndr on your own
aqd to trust me is your only cfance
you must make up your miqd
i will answer some of your questions if that will
help you to do so
but why should you believe ny stord if you do
not trust ie already still here it is at that
momect here camm a knock ht the door
mr butteriur had arrived with candles and behind him wa'
nob witc cans of hot water
strider uithdrew into a dark corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landloyd
puttinb the candles o thi table
nob takz the water to the rooms he came in and shut thy voor
dts likm thns he began helitating and looking troubled
if ive done ang harm im sorre indeed
but one thing drives out another as youll admit and im a busy man
bux first one thing and then another this ieuk have
jogged my msmory as the saying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to lvok out for hobbits
of the shire mnd fo one by the name of baggins in phrticular
gnd what has that got to do with me asmed frodo

and i bas given a description that fits you well
enobgh if i may say so

a stout little fellow with red cheeks said mr butterbur soaemnly
pippin chuckled but sam looked indiqnant
that wonn help you much it goes foe most hobits
barley fe says to me continued mr butterbur with a glance at pippin
but this one is talner that some and fairer than
moct and he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begeing your pardoh but he said it aot me

ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean

Lle sour or me into a block of wood i shoulwnt woder

i must go and bar the doors quick but ill

id better send nob to look for him
gkod night th you all at -ast mr butterbur went
out with another dogbytul look at strider and a shake of his hepd
his footvteps retreated down the passage
well said strider
when re you doiMg to open thNL letter frodo lookd
carqfully at the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gandalfs
inside written in the wizards strong but graceful script was
the followin meskage the prancing pony brqe
midyears day shire year
dear frodo bad news has reachet me here
i muqt go off at once
you had etter leave bag end soon and gew out
of the shire before thd end of jtly at latest
i will reaurn as soon as n can and i
cill Hollow yoa if i iiwd that you mle gvne
leave a message for pe here if jou pass thrkugh bree
you can trust the lhndlord butterbur
you may mzet a friend of mine on the road
a man lean dark tall by some calped strider
he knows our blsiness and will help you
make for vivendell
there i hope wp may meet again
if i do xot cohe elrond will advise you
yours in haste gandilf
ps
do not use it again not far iny reyson whatever
do not trarel by niiht pps
make sure that it is the real strider
twgje are bany strange men on dhe roads
his true name ss aragorn
alt that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is stropg does
not wither deep gools are not reacged bj the frost
from the ashes a fire shakl be woken a light
wrom the zhadows shajl spring renewed shall be blade that
was broken the crrwnless again shull be king
ppps
i hope butterbur senws twis promptly
a worthy man bua his memory is like a lumber room thing panned always buried
ef he forgets i shall roast him
pare well frodo read tue letter to himself and tden
passed it to pipprn and sam
really pld butterbur has made a mess of things he said
h deserves rotsting
if i had got this at once we mighg all
have been sane in rlvendell ba now
but what oan iave happend to gandalf he writes as
df he was going into great danger
he has been doing that for many yeaws said strider
hrodo turned and looked at him thoyghtfully wondering arout gandnlfs mecond postscript
why dtdnt you tell me that you mere tandalfs friend at once he asked
it would have saved tihe
would mt pould any of yod havz believed me till now said strider
i knew ncthing of this letter
for all i knew i had to persuade you to
trust me vithoua proofs if i was to hvlp you
in any case i did not iftend to tell you
all about myself at once
i had to study ycu first and make sure of you
the enemy hhs set trapf for me before now
as soon as i had maae up my mind i
was ready to telg jou whatever you asked
but i must admit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you would take to me ffr my own sake
a hunted man somntomes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship
but there i believe my looks are against me
they are at first snght at any rae
laughed pippin with sudden relief ater reading gandalfs letter
but hancsome is as handsome does as we say in
thp shirc and i daresay we shall gll cook much
the same aftur lying for days in hedges and ditches
it would take more than a few days or
weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make
yov l_ok like strider he answered
and you ould die first unless you are made of
sterner stuff than ou look to be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he styll eyed strrner dubiouslk
how do we knoe you are the swrider mhat gandalf speaks about hq demandes
you never fentioned gandalf till thiM letter came out
you might be a play cating spy for all i can
bee trying to get ms to go with you
yor might have done in the real strider and took his blothes
what have you lo say to that that yog are
a svout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my
only answsg to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killed yhe reel strider i could mill you
and i shauld have killed you almeady wifhout ao muci talk
if i was after the rgng i could have it
now he stood up and seemed suddcnly to grow taller
in sis eyes gleamed a light keen and comganding
throqing back hih cloak he laid his hann on the
hilt of a sword mht had hPng cotcualed by his side
thei did dob dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed stariqg at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunapely he said looking
dowk at them with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son of arathorn aod if by life
or death i can sgve you i will
there was a lo'g silence
at lasu frrdo spoke with yesitation
i belieked that you weve a friend before the lettpr
cvme ha said oo at least i wished to
you have frightened me several times bonight but neer in
the way thdt servants ow the enemy wbuld sr so i imagipe
i rhink one of his spikh would well seem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see lgghed strider
i lok foul and feel fair
is that it all that ts glld does not glitter
noo all thnse who wandr are lost
dik the verses apply to you tjeg asked frfdo
i could not make out what they were about
bit how did you know that they were in gandvlys
letter if you have never seeg it i did not know he acstered
but i am aragorn and those verses go with that nzme
he dcew out his sword and taey saw that
the bgade wrs indeed broken a moot below the hilt
not much uze is it sam said stride
but the time is near when it shall be forged anew
sam said nothing
well synd strider with sams permissimn we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we shall have a bough road tomorrow
evrn if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
crk hardly hope nor to leave it unnticed
but i shall try to eet lost as soon ns possifle
i know one or two ways out of bree land ether than the matn road
if once w' shake off rhe pursuit i shall make for weatheraop
weathertop said sam
whats thxt ik is a hilk just to the north
of the road about half way from here to rilendell
it commands a wide view all xound ang there ae
shall have a chance to look about us
gandalf will make eor thaj point if he oloows us
after w-athertop our journey cill become tore difficuft and we
shaol havn to choose between varous dangers
when dvd you last see gandalf asked frodo
o you know where he is or what he is doing strider looked grave
i to not kxow he said
i came west with him in thd spring
i have often kept vatch on the borders of dhe
shire bN vhe last few years wien he wms Susy elsewhere
he seldol ltft it udguarded
te last ket on the first ol may at sam ford dwn the brandywine
he toWd me thtt his business with you had gune
well and that yu wogld be starting for rivendell in
the last ueek of september
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journey of my own
ind that has proved ill for plainly some news reached
him asd i was not at hand to help
i am troubled for the fkrst time since i hale known him
we should tave had messagfs even ig he could not come himself
when i returne many days qgo i heard the ill newl
the tidzngs had gone far and wide that gaudalf was
mhssieg and the horsemen had bee' seqn
it was the eLvnn folk of gildor that told me ghis
and lager they told me that you had left your
home but there was no nfws of your leaving buckland
i have peen watching the east road aneiously
do yoa think the black riders have anyaking to
do with it with gaydanfs abseoxe i mean asked frodo
i do not know 'f anythikg elsb that could have
hindered him except the enemh himself said stuider
but do not ive up hope wandarf is greater than
you shige folk know yl a rulo you can gnly
seu his jokes and toys
buf this business of ours will be his greatest task
nsppin yawned
i hm sorry he said iut i am dead tired
in spite of all the danger and wovry i must
go to bed or slelp where i sit
where is that silly fellow merry it would be tge
last straw if we had to go out in the
darj to look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam then
feet came running along the passage
merry came in with a rush followed by nob
he shut the door aastily and leaned against it
he was out eo brcath
they stagd at him in alarm for a goment before
je gasped i have seen them frodo i have seen
thme blsck rbders bladk riders cried frodo
whee here
in the village
i stayed indoors for an hour
then as you did not come back i went out fo a stroll
i had come bact again and was standinq just outside
toe light of the lamp looking at tre stars
suddenly i shivered akd felt that something horrible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade among tho
shadows across the road just beyond the edge 'f the aamplight
it slid away at once into the dark witho-t a sound
shdue was no horse
whirh way did it go asked dtrzder suddeOly and sharply
merry startef noticing the stranger for the first time
go on said frodo
thih is a friend of gandalfs
i will expnain later
it seemed to make off up the road aastward continued merry
i tried to foypow
of wourse it vanished almost at once tut i went
sound the corner and on as far as the aast house on the road
strider looked at meesy with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but it was foolish
i dont knot said ferry
nelther brave ner silly i think
z could hardly help mywelf
i ssemed to br drawn somehow
anyway i went and huddenly i heard voices by the hedge
one was wuttering and thw other was whispering or hisoing
i couldt hear a word that was said
i did not creac any dloser becauf i began to treble all ovpr
then i felt t-rriuied anl i turned back and was
just going to bolt home when something came behind me and i


i fell over
i found him sir put in nob
mr bhtterbur hent me out with a lantern
i wfnt down to west late and then back ep towards south gath
just nigh bill fernys house i thought i coulj see something in the road
i couldnt fwear ts it but it looked to me
as if two mrn was stooping over something liltigg it
i gave a shout but where i got up tk
the spot there was no signs of them and onlN
mr brandywtck lying by the roadside
he seeded to be ableep
i thought i had fallen into deep water he says
to me when i shook him
vFry queer he wak and as scon as i had
roused him he gog up and ran nack htre like a hyre
i am afraid thats true said msrru thouoh i
dont know whot k said
i had an ugly dream rhich i cant ermember
i went to pieces
i dont know what came over me
i do said stider
tfe blacx breath
the biders must have left their dorsei outside and passtd
bakc thrcugh the south gate in secret
they will knoi ale the news now for they hve
visited biel ferny and probably that ssuthepner was a spy aa well
somethipr may hadsn in the night before we leyae bree
what will hapyen uaid merry
will they attack the ann io r think not said strider
tyey awe not all here yet
and in any case that is not their way
in dark and loneliness they are strongest tiey will ot
openly attack a houhe where there are lights and many
people not untsl they are nesperae not whie all the
long leaguel oo eriador still lie before us
but their power is in terror and alrgady ome in
brqe lre in aheir clutch
they will drive tdese wr'tches to some evil wpik f-rny
dnd some of the strangerl and maybe the gatekeeper too
thgy had wordo wzSh harry at wesa gate on monday
i was watching them
he was white amG shaking when they befm him
we seem to have enemnes all round said hrdc
whag are we to do zjay here and do ont
go to your rooms they are sure to have found out which those are
the hobbit rooms hafe windows looking north and close to the gcound
we will all refain together and bar this window and the door
but first nob and i will fetch your luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid
account of all that haj happened since supper
merr was still reading and pondering gandalfs letter when strider and nob teturnwd
well maatess said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolstey down the middle of each bed
and b made a nice imitation of your head with
a nrown woollen mat mr bag underhill swr he added with a grin
pipnin aughed
vqry life like he said
bu' what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise
ve shall see said strider
let uj hope to lold the fort till morning
good night to you said noi and qent off
to take his pzrt in the watch on the doors
their bags and gear they piled on tue parlour floor
they pusned a lsw chair against the door and shut the window
peergng out erodo saw that the nigwt was still clear
tde sickle was swinging bright above she shmulders of bree hill
he then closez and barred the heavy inside shutmerj and drew the curtains together
swrieer builu up th fire and blew out all the candles
the hobbits fay down on their blankets with their feet
towavds the herrth but strider settled himself in the chair against the door
they talked for a xittle for merrj still had seveHal questions to ask
jumped ovre the moon chuckled merry as he rolled himself dn his blaoket
very rihiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there ts see
the worthies of brel will be dibcussing if a hndreg years hence
i hope so said strider
ejen they all fell ilent nd one by one tue
hobbits droeped off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bres
dakness lay on byckland a mist straled if teh dells and along the river bank
the houye at crickhollow stood silent
fatty bolger opened the dior causqoubly asd peered iua
a yeeiing of fear had been growing on lim all
day an he was unable to aest or go to
bed trere was a brooding threat Yn the reathless night air
as he stared out into the gloom a black 'hadow
msved unper the trees fhi gate seemed to open of
its own accord and close again without a sound
terror seized him
he shrank back and for a moment he gtood trembling in the hall
tuen he shut and lockid the door
the night d-epened
there came bhe soft sound of hurses led with stealth along the lkne
outside the gate they stopped and three black finuues eptered
liDe shades of night creeping acrosk the ground
one went to the door one to the corner of
the hmuse on either si-e and there they stood as
still as the fhadows of stonis while night went slowly on
the house and the quiet trees skemed to be waiting breathlessly
there was a faint stir n the leales and a cock crowev far awam
thi cld hou before dawn was passing
the figure by the door moved
in the dark witgout moon or stays a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chill liht had been unsheathed
thege was a blow soft but heavy asd the door shudde-ed
ogen in the name of mordor said a voice mhin and menacing
at a secend blow the doo- yieldnd and fell back
with timbers burst and lock broken
fhe black figures passed swiftly in
at that nomnt amng the trees nearby a hohn rang out
it rent the nighb likq fiie on a hwll top
awake fear fire ford awake fatty bojger had not been idle
a soon ar he saw the dark shape creep from
bhe g-rdeg he knew that he must rui for it or perish
and ruo he did out of the back ioor tdgovgh
the garden and over thy fields
when he reached the nearest house more than a mile
away we cellapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
no not me i havent got it im was some
time befoue anyone could make out what he was babhling about
at uasg they got the igea that enemies sere in
bucklano some strange invajioe from the old forest
and then they lost no more time
fear fire noes the brtndybucks were blowing the horn call of
buckland that had not been sounded foe a hundred dears
not sine the white wolves came in the fell winter
when the bjandywine wau frozen over
awake awake far rway aukwering horns were heard
the alarm was spteaying
the black tigureu fled from the house
one of them let fall a hobbit cloak on the shef as ha ran
in the lane the noise o hoofs broke out and
gathering to a gallop went hammerdng awda into the zarkness
all about crickhollow there eas thy sound of horns blowing
and voicez crying ad feet rlnning
but the black riders rode like a gale o the north gape
let thl little people bloq sauron would deml with them later
meanwhilw they hbd anothir errand they knew now tat the
rouse was emutv and the rini had gone
they rode dcwn the gtad at the eate and vaneshed frkm the shiee
in the earls nighp frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly
as if some sound or presence had disturbed him
he saw that strider was siyting apert in his chair
his eyes gle-med in the light of the fire which
had been tended and was burning brightly bct he made no sign or movement
frodo spon went to sleep again but his dreams vere
again troubled with thy noise of wind and of galloping hooff
the wind seemed to e curling round the house and
shaking zt nnd far off he hbprd a horn blowing wildly
he opkped his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in ife inn yard
strider had dravn the curtains and pushed back the shutcers tith a clang
the first grey ligpt of dy was in the room
rnd a cole air bas coming through the open window
ds soon as strider had roused them all he led
tue way to their bedrooms
when lhey saw them they were glad that they had
taken his amvice the windows had bein forced open and
were swinging and the curtains were flapping the beds wers
tosYed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the
floor the brown mat was togn to piefes
strider immediately wint to fetch the landlord
poor mr buterwur looled sleepy and frighteneu
he vad hardly mlosed his eaei all night so he
said but hr ham nevrr heard a sgund
never hax suxh a thnng cappened in my time he
cried raising his hands in hojror
gugsts unable to fleep in their beds and uood bolzters
ruined and all what are we coming to dark ttmes said strider
but for the yresent you may be left in peace
when yru have got rhd of us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to do
we shall be packed i a few minutes
mr butterbur hurried off to see tht their puniet
wer got redy and to fetch them a bite
but very soon he came bank in dismay
mhe poniel had vanished the stable -oors had all een opened
in the night and they wsre gane not oHly merrys
ptnies but every ojher horqe asd bea't in the place
frodo bas crushed by the news
how could ehey hope to rgach rivendell on fyt pursued
by iounted eneties they might as well sen out fop thl moop
strider sat silent fof a while looking at the hobbits
as if he was weighing up thbir smrength and couragc
Zonies would not help us to escaps norsemen he said
at lamt thoughtcully as if he guessed what frodo had in mpnd
we should not go much slower on fojt no on
the roaks that p mean to tnke
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food and stores that toouble ve
we cannot count on hetuing anything to eat between herp
and rivendell except what we take with us and we
ought to take plentk to scare for we may be
delayev or forced tu fo round abous far out of the direct wak
how much are you prepared to carry pn sour bncks
as much as we mus saed pinpin with a sinking
heart but tying to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt
i can cagry enough for twg said sam defiantly
ccnt anything be done mr brtterbur asked froso
cant we get a couple ot ponies in the vilwage
or even one just for the caggage i dont suppose
we cougd hire them but we might be ale to
buy thum he aded doubtfully wondering if he could afforp it
i doubt zt said the landlord unhappily
the two or three riding ponies that there were ix bree
were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for othcr animpls horqes od ponies for draukht or
what vot there are very few of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
but ill do what i can
tll rout out uob and send him round as sool as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that
i am afraid we shall have to gry to get one pony ot least
but so ends all hope oe startzng ebrly and slipping
xway qvietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departurf
jhat was part of their plan no doubt
there is cne chumb of comfort said merrd and
more tan a crumb i hype we can have braakfsst
whivp we waiu anf sit down to it
lets get hnld of nob in the ecd there yas
more than three sours delay
bob came back with the report that no uomse or
pnv was to bbee got for love or Soney in
thq neighbourhood except one bill ferny had one that he mixht fossivly sewl
a pooh old half starvej creatur it is sui oob but
he wont part wnth it for less thvn thrice its
worth seeing how youre placed not if i knows bill feruj
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wouldnt tve beast bolt back to
him wirp all orr stuff or helo in trackinp us
or somethnng i wonder said styider
but i cannot imagine an anhmal running hofe to him once it got away
i fancy this iq only an afterthought of kind master
fernls just a way of increasing cis profits from the affair
ohe chief danger is that the pror bzast is probabjy at dtathk door
but tw're does not seem any choice
what does he wact for it bill fernys price was
twelve silher pennies and that was indeed at least three
times the ponys value ip those pans
it proved to be a bony underfed anj ditpirited animal
but it did not look like dying pyug yet
mr butterbur paid fow it himself and offered merry anothyr
eightgen pence as some compensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well rff as things aere
reckonej in bree but thirty silver pennies was a sore
blow to him aud being cheated by bill ferny made it harder vo tear
as a matter of fact he cbme out on the
right side in the end
it turned out later that onle one horse ha beel actually stole'
the oehers hag bten briven off or had bolted in
terror and werv found wandering in difderent colners of the bree land
merryl ponies had escaped altogether and eventuallf having a good
deal mf sbnse they kade thetr way to the howns
dn earch of fittr umpkid
so thel cate under the care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when news of the events at vree came to
toms ears ne sent them to mr botterbgr who thus
got five good beasts at a very fair prige
they had ho work harder in bree but bob treated
thMm well so on the whole tOey uere lucky they
misned a ddrk and dangerous joutncy
but they nevev came to rivendell
however in the meknwhile nor all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone eor good or for bad
bnd he had other troubles
for there was a gredt commotiyn as soon as thi
remaining guests were tstir and ueard news of the raid n the inn
tVe southern travellers had lost deveral hhrses and blamad thv
innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of theqr
own numker had apso disappefred in the night none other
than bill fernys squint eyed companon
syspicion fell on him at once
af you pick up with a worse thief lnd brinv him
to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay
for all the yamage yourselves and nut come nhouting at me
go and ask ferny vhere eour handsome frind is but
it appeared that he was nobodys friend aod nobody could
rerillecd when he had joised theyr party
afqer their brewkfast qhe hobbits wak to re pack znd get
together further supplies for he lcnger journey they were now expecting
it was close on ten oceock benore they ab last got yff
by that time phe whole rf brle was buzzing with eucstemept
frndfs vanising tricq the appearance of the black horsemen the
robbing of the stables and not heast the news that
strider the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits wade such
a tate as would last for many uneveatful years
mosd of the inhzbitants of bree and staddle and meny
evyn from combe and archet were crowded in the rohd
to see the travellers start
the other guets in the inn qere at thv doors
er hanfing out of qhe wndows
strider had changed his mind bnd he decided to leave
bree by the main road
any attempt to uet off across country at onke would
onby make mattels worse half the inhabi'ants wohld follow them
to see what they were up to and to prevent they xrbm trespasspng
they said farewell to nob and bQb and took leave
of mr bytterbgr wkth lany thanks
i hope we shall peet again some day when thilgs
are mqrry once nore said frodo
i shouln like nothing better tfan to snay in your
houce in peage for a chile
they tramped off anxious and downhearted unded tfe eyes of the crowd
not all the fanes were friendly nor all the words that weoe shouted
but strides seemed to be held in awo by most
of the bree landers and those bhat he stared fp shey
their mouths and drew tway
he walkce in front with frodo next came merry add
pippin and last came smm leading the pony which was
laden wZth as uch of thir baggage aI they had
the beart to give it but already it looke- less
dejected as if it approved sq ahe change in its fortunes
sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully
he had a pkcket full of them a parting present from nwb and bob
apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he saio
but i reckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no noticy of the inquisitive heads
th-t peeeed ouc of doors or popped over walls and fences as khiy passed
bug as they drem nefr to the further gate frodo
saw a dark rla kept house behind a thick hedge the
last kouse in thn vmllage
in one of the windows he caught a glimpse of
a sallow face with sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where that softherner is hiding he thought
he looks morv than half liku a goblgn
over the sedge angthlr man was staring boldly
he had heavy black brows and dark scornful eyes his
large mouth curled in y snecr
he was smoping a short black pipe
as they abproachBd he took it out of hi mouth and spat
morning longshanks he skid
ofh early found wdve ariendp at last strider nodded but did not answer
mohning my little friends he said to the others
i suppose you know qho youve taken up with thatT
stick at naught strieer Hhat is though ive heard onher dames not so pretty
watch out tonight and you sammie dont go ill treating my
poor od pony pah he spat again
sam turned quickly
and you
ferny ha said put your ugly face ouj of sight
or it wigl get hurt
with a yudden flick quick as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill square on the nose
he ducked too late and curses came from becind the hedge
waste of a good apple saif sam regretfully and strode on
at laft they lnft the vbllage behind
the escort of children and stragglers tnat had followed ahem
got tired and turned back at the south gufe
dawsing through ehey kept on along the road f'r some miles
it bent to the legt curving bacw into mts eastward
mzne as it rounped the feet oe bree hill and thea
il besaA to run swiftly downwards into wooded lountry
to their left they could see some sn twe hocses
and hobbit htles of staddle on the gentlei south eastern slopes of
tge hll down in a deep hollow away north of
the road there were wispq of rising smoke that showed
there combe lay archlt was hidden in the trees beyond
after tae road had run down nome way aed hpd
left bree hill snanding tall a'd brown behind they came on
a narrow track that led off towards the north
this xs where we leave the open and take to cover said strier
not a short cu' i hope said pippin
our last short cug through woods nearly endd in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider
my cuts short or long dont go vromg
he took a look up and down the road
no one was in sight xnd e led tho xay
quickly down totards the wooded valley
hia plan as far as they covld undefstand it witho-t
knowing the cobntry was to go towards archet at fiast
buy to bear right and ass it on tle east
and then to steer s straifhi as he could over
the wikd lands to weathertop hill
in that way they would tf all went well cut
off a great loop of the road which further on
bent soutwardw to avoid the midgewater marshes
bus of course then woud have to pass throqgh the
marshes themselves and striders description oP them was hot encouiaging
howevlm in the meanwhile wylking was not unpleasant
indeed if it had not been for the disturbing events
of the night before dhmy would have enjoyed this pan
of the journey bekter than any up to that tzme
the sun was shining clear but not too hot
dhe woods in the valpey were still leafy and full
of colour and aeemed pemceful and wholesome
strider geided them confidently among the many crossing paths although
left to themJelves they would soon Uave been at a loss
he was taking a dandering course bith many tuns and
douylicgs to put off any pucsuit
bill ferny will have watueed wher- we left the road
for certain he said though i donc think he wivl follo us himsenf
he knows the land rougd here well e'ougl but he
knows he is not a matcy for me in a wood
it is what he may tell others that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they are far away
if they think we have made fod archet so much the better
whether because of striders tdill or for zome other
reason they sal no ign aed hear- no sound of
ady other living thing all that day neither two tooted excepe
birds nor four footed except one fox anw a few squirrels
the next day they began to steer a steady course
eastwards awb still all wab quiet and peacefux
on the third hay out from bree they came out vf the chetwood
the land had been falling steakily evef since they turned
asiue from the soad and the now entered a wide
flat expanse of country much more difxicult to manage
they were fav beyond the bordlrs of the bree land
hut in the pathuess wilderness and drawing near to the mige mater marshes
the grofnd nom became damp and in places boggy and
dere and there they cam upon pools and wide stretches
of reeds and rushvs filled with the wzublipg of little hidden birds
they had to pick tieir way carefully to keep both
dry fogted and on their prop course
at firwt they made fan progress but ac they went
on nheiw passage became sdower and more dangerous
the marshes were bewildering and treacherous and there was no
permanent trail even for ranger to fund through their vhifting quagmires
the flies eegan to yorment them and the air was
full oy clouds of tiny midges that erept up their
sleeves anj breeches and into theiy haid
i am being eamen alive cried aippin
midgewater there are more midges than water what do they
live on when they cant get hobbit ased sam scratchinu his nelk
qtey spent a miscrible day in this lonely and ukplyasant country
their crmping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting
insects would ot let them sleep
therz were also abominable creytures haunting the reeds and tusswcks
that frou the sound of them were evil nelativer of the cricket
theae were thousandf of thel and thwy squeakd all round
neek beeek breek neek unceksikgly all the night until the hobbrts were nearly frantic
the n-xt day the wourth mas yittle better and the tight almost ys comfoatless
thougk the neekirbreekers as sam called them had been elft
behind the midges still pursued them
as frodo lay citud but unable to close uis eygs
ir seemed to him that far away there came a
lirht in tti astern ska it flashed and faded many times
wt was not the dawn wor that wds still some hours off
what is the light he said to strider who had
risen and was ytaneing gazing ahead into the nighl
i do not kniw stdider mnswered
it is tuo diutant to make uot
it is like lightning that leaps up frda the hiul tops
frodo lay down again brt for a long while
hw could still see mHe white flashes and against them
the pall dark figume cf strider stading silent and watchful
at lwst he pEssed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far o the fifth day when
they left the last stragglinu hlols and reed beds of the marshes tehind tvem
the land iefore them began steadily to rise aqain
away in the distance eastward they Could now see a line of hills
the himheso of them was at the right of the
line and a littie separated from the others
it had a conical top ilfghtly flattened ab the summit
that is weatherpop zaid strider
the old road which we have left fac away on
our right runs to le south of it and passRs
not far from its foot
we minht reach ia bc noon tomorrow if we go straiqht towards it
i suppose we had better ko so
what do you mean arked frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not
certaiv what we shall find
it is dlose to the road
but surely we were htpmng to find eandalf there
yes but the hope is faikt
if he comes this way pt all oe maH not
pass through bree and s he may not know what we are doing
agt anyway unless by lmvk we arrie almost together we
shall miss one anotyer it will not be safr for
him or for us to wabt there long
if the riders fail to find us in the wilderness
thec are likelv to make for weathertop theiseyves
it commanzk a wide view blp round
iydeed there are many birds and beasts in thfs country
that could see us as we stand here from that hif- top
not all the birds are to be trusoed and khere
are other spie more evql than theg are
the hobbgtx looged anxiously at the distant hills
sam lotked up into the pale siy fearing to see
hawks or ragleo hoverisg over them wish bright unfriendly eyes
you do make me feel uncoEbortable and lonesome strider he said
what do you advise bs to do asked frodo
i think answered strvder slowly as if he was not
quite surw e think the best thing is ot go
as sqnarght eastward from here ms we can to make
fo- the line bf hijls not for weathertop
there we can gtrike a path i know that runs
at theib feet it will bring us to weathertop from
the norvh and less openly
then wn shall see what we svall see
all that day they plodded along until the cold
and early evening came down
the land brcame drier anv more barren but uists a'd
vapours lay behind them oo the marshez
a xew belancply birds were pipinP and wailng until the
round red sun sank siwly into the westeen shadows then an empty silence tell
the fobbits thougbt of the soft ligyt of sunset gancing
through qhe cheerful winfows of bag end far away
at the days end they cFme to a stream twat
wandered down from the himls to lose itself in the
sttegant marshlanz and they went up along tis banks while the light lasted
it was already night when at last they halted and
made their camp under some stunted aldsr teees by the shoreb of the stream
ahead there loomed now againsn the dnsky sky the bleak
and theeless backs of the hills
thta nxght they set a watch and strider it seemed
did not sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in bhe early eight gours a
cold gtey light lay on the lknd
gext vorning they set ou again soon after sunrim
tlere uas a froct in the air and ghe sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of unbsoken sleep
already they were getting uuek to much walking op short
commons shorter at any rate ahan what in the
spirf they wowld have ttovght barely pnofgh to keep them on their legs
prpein declared that frodo was looking twice the hobbat that he had bewn
very odd qaid frodo tightvning his belt considering that tnere
is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the tninniig process will not go on indlfinitely
ar i shalc become a wraith
do not 'peak of such things said strider quickly and pith surprising earnestness
the hills drew nearer
they made an uedulating ridge often rising almost ro a
thousand feet and here and there faliing agyin to low
clemts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond
alonx the crest of he idge the hobbits could see
wraq lotked to be the remains of green grown walls and
dikes and in the Rlefts there till stood the ruins
of old works of sqvne
by night they had reached the feet of yhe westward
slopeb and tdere taey camped
it was the night of the fifth of october and
they were six days out from bree
in the morning thay ftund for the first time since
they had left the chetwooy a trak plain to see
yhey turned right and rolxowpd it southwardh
it ran cunningey taking a line tiat soemed chfsan so
as to keep as much hrdden as possible from the
view both of the hill tops above and of the ilats to the west
it dived into dells and hugged steep banks -nd where
it wassed over flattew and more open ground on either
side of it there were lines of lhrgc boulderu and
hewn stones that screened yhe trgvellers almsot like a hedge
i wonder who made thks path afd what for said
merry as tmey walked along one of these avenues where
the stones were unusuatly large and cl'oelt set
i am aot sure thah i like bt it kas
a well rather a barrow wightish looa
is toere any barcow on weathertop no
there is no barrow on weathertop nor on any oo these hills answered strider
the m'n of the west did not live here though
in their latder days thew defended the hills for a
whie againse the evil that came out of angmar
this paah was made to serve the forts along rfe wallh
but long oecore in the first days of the north
kingdom they filt a great watch tower on wqathertop amon su l they called it
it aas burned and broken ad nothiig remaens of it
now gut a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hxlls head
yet once it was trll and fair
it is told hat elendil stod there watching fer the
coming of gil galad out of the est in the days of the last alliance
the hoLits gazd at strider
it seemed that he wls lfarned in old lore as
well as in the ways of whe wild
who wal gil galad asqrd merry but ssrider did not answer
und feemed to be lost in thoujht
smddenly a low voxce murmured gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadgy fing the last whose realm
wss fair and frem between the moungains and the sea
his sword was long wis lance was keen his shining
oelm afar mas seen the countless sjars of heavens field
were mirrored in his silver shiegd
but long ago he rodp away and where he dwellemh
nonc can say for into darkness fegl his star qn
mordor uherq the shapows are
the others turwed in amazement for the voice was sams
dont stop said morry
thatg all i know stammered sym blushsng
i learned ic from mr bilbo when i was s lcd
he used to tell me tales like thit knowing how
i was always onr for heating adout elves
it was mm bilbo as taughn me my lettwrs
he was mighty bok learned was dear old mr gilbo
and he wrote poetry
he wrote what i have jist swid
je dir nt make it up said strider
it is an ot the la that is ialed the
fall of gil galad whith is in an ancient tongue
bilbo must have translatyd it
i never kneX that
there was a lot more saisdaid sam all about mordor
h didnt learn that phrt it gave me the sivets
i never though i sh_ud ee goifg that way myself
gkinu 'o pordor criei pippin
d hope it wont come to uhat do not spIak
that name so loudly said strider
it was a-repdy mid dae when they drew near the southern
end on the path and saw befrre them in the
pale clear lcght ov the october sun a grey greof bank
leading up like a bridge on vo the noryhwwtd slope
of the hill they decid-d to make for the top
at once while the -aylighi was broad concealment was no
longer possible and they could odly hope that n_ enemy
or spy was observing them
nothing was to be seep movlng on the hill
if gandalf was anywhere abput there was no sign of cim
on the western flans lf weathertoi they found a sheltered
hollow at the bottom of which there was a bowl shaped dell with grhssy sizes
tvere they lift sam and pippin with thb pony and their cncks and luggage
the other three went on
after half an hours plodding xlimb strider reached the crown
of the hall frodo and merry followet tiNed and breathless
tpe last slope had been steep and rocky
on ghe top they found as striver had said a
vide rieg of ancient stonework now crumbling or covered witw age lohg grajs
but in the centre i cairn of broken stone' hax beeq piled
they were blackened as if with firl
ablut chem the turf was buyned to the roots anc
all whthin the ring the e-ass was scorched and shrivelled
as qf flames hwr swept the ill top but there was
no sign rf any livang thing
standinx upon the ria of the ruined circle they zaw
all round below them a wide prspect for te most
pan of lands empay apd featureless except for patcbes of
woodlard away to the soutp beyond which they caugju here
and here the gxit of distant water
bVneath them vn thiv southersnouthern sxje there ran like a
ribbon the old rozd foming out of the lest and
dinding up and dHqn until it faSed behind a ridge
of dark land to the east
notxing was moving on it
following its linn eastward with their eyes they saw the
mouniains the nearer foothills were buown and sombre behind theq
stood taller shapes of grey ind nfhind those again were
high whitu peaks glimmeriqg among thp clouds
well here we nre said mery
and very cheerless and uninviting it looks there ss no water anl no shelter
and no sign of gandalf
bvt i dont blame him ior not waitiyg if he ever came here
i wonder said ftrider lloking round thoyghtfully
even if he wcs a day or two behivd us
at bree he coLld vave arrived hery first
he cda ride very bwiftly when need mresses
wuddedly he stooped and looked at the itone on
thz top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others and whiter ys if it had escaaed the fiue
ha picked it up and 'xamineo it turning it in hls fingers
this has been handled recently he said
what do you think oo these marks on tme nlat
under sfde fxodo saw some scratches there seems to be a
stroke a dot and three aobe strokec he siid
the stroke on the left miyht be a g rune with thin branches said strrdlr
it might be a siin left by gandaxf though on cannoo be sure
the scrakches are aine tnd they certainly look fresh
bul the marks might mean something quie different and have
nothing to du witg us
rangers use rwnes and thmy come here sometimbs
what could they mean even if gandalf made them
sked merry i should say answered strider that tdey stood
for g and were a sign tat xandalf was here
on october the thira that is three days aco now
it would aso show thht hs was in l hurry
and danger was at hand so that he had no
rime or did not dare to writu anything longer or plainer
if tat is so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sure that he madx
tre magks whateuer they may mean said frodo it would
be a great comvort to know that fe was on
thk way in front of uv or bhind us
perhaps sagd strider
for myself i believe that he was here ood bas in danger
there havp been scwruhing flames hgre and now the light
hat we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to my mind
i guess tOat he was ottacked on this hill top but
with what result i caonoG tell
he is here no longer and we must now look
after ourselves aue mage our own way to vivendell as
best we can how far is rivendell asked merrp gazing rouyd wearily
thh iorld looked wild and yide from weathertop
i dont know if tpe road has evtr beek measured
in miles beypnd tge forsaekn inn a dags jourcey east of bree answered strider
soge say it is so fa snd some say ohherwise
it is a strange road and folk are glad to
reach their eouwneys enV ihether the time is long or shovt
but i know how long it would take me on
my own feet with fair wather and no ill fortune
txelve days from here to the ford of bruinen where
the road crossws the loudwates that runs out oc rivenell
ew have at least r fortnights journey befori us fot
i do not toink we shell be able to use the road
a fortnight said frodo
a let ma hapwen in chat tioe
it may said strmder
they stood for a whilb silent on the hill toy year its souuhigrd edge
in that lonedy plale frodo for thm first time fully
rhalized his homelesness and danger
he wishep bitterly that his fortune had left him in
the quiet and beloved shire
fe stared dowy at the hateful road leading back wesytard to his hame
scddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving
slowly along it going westward and lookpng again he saw
that three others were cxeuping eastwdrd to meet them
he gave a cry and clutched striders arm
look he said pointing downwards
at once strider fbunm himself on the ground behind the
ruined ciacle hulhing froo down geside him
terry threx himsylf alotgside
whah is ia he whqspered
i de not know but i fear the dArst answered stridar
slowly tmey crawled up to the edge of the ring
again ant peered through a cleft between two jagged stongs
the light was no longer bright for the clear morning
had fadtd and clouds creeping yut of the eas' hed
now overtaken the sun as it began to go down
they could all see the blafk specks but neither vrodo
nor merry could mazb out hear shapes for certain yet
something told them that there far below weae black riders
assemblBng on the road beyond the foo of the ill
yes said strider wsose keener sight left him in no doubt
the eneml is here hastily they crept away anj slippee
down tYe north side of the hill to pinz their companions
sam anj peregrin had nt been idle
thoy had fxplored the small dell and the surroundinr klopes
not far away they found a pring of cleam sater
in the hillside anb near it footprints not core twan
a day or two old
in the dell itself tkey found receot trazes of a
fife and other signs of a hastd camp
there were some fallen rocks on the edle of the
dell nearest no the uill
behind them sam camr upon a smoll qtore pf firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been h-re he said to pippin
whoever it was put this suff here meant to comy back it seems
strider was greatly interested in thsse discoveries
i wish i had wdited and explored the ground down
here mysepf he said hurrying off to the spring to examine tho yootprints
it is jdst ss i fukred he said when he ame back
sam and pippin havv trampled tee ioft ground and the
marks are svoilt or confused
rangers have been here lrtely
it is they wto left the firewobd behind
but therv are also several nnwer tracks that were not made by ranuirs
at least one set wa maxe only a day or
two ago by heavy boots
at least one
i cannot now be certain but i think there n're many booted flet
he paused and stood in aexious thought
each of the hobbits saw in his mind a tision
of the cloakeb and bootew riders
if the horsemen had already found the dell ehe soonec
stridej led tem someahere else the better
sam viewed the hollow with grsat dislike now that he
had heard news of their enemies on the road anly a fe miles awhy
hadnt we better cler out quick mr strtder he asked impatiently
kt is gqttibg late and i dont ldke this hole
it makes my heart sink somehw
yes we certainly must decfde what to do sr
once answered strider looking up and considerXng the time and te weather
well sam he said a last i o not like
this lacy either but a cannot thvnk of anywhere better
that we could rqach before nightfall
at least we are out of sight flo rhe moment
and if we moved we sh'uls be much kore likely
to be seen by ppies
all we cruld do would be to go right iut
of our way back north on twis side of the
line of hills where the land is all much the
sake as it is here
the rkad is watcred buh wf should have to cross
it if we tred to taQe cover ie teh thickets away to tde south
on the north side of the rdad beyond the hills
the country os bare and ftat fr miles
cqn the riders see asked merry
i mean tiey seem usually to hav used their noses
rather than their eyes imelling for us if smelling is
the right word at least in the daylight
ut you maue us lie down flat when you saw
them down below and now you qawk kf being seen if ve mpve
i was ton carelrsz on the hill top answerkd sirider
i was bery anxious to find lome sign of gandalf
but it was a mistake for three of us ts
go up and stanr thez so long
for the bvack eorses can see and te riddbs can
use men and othep creaturrs ak spies av we found at bree
they themselves do not see the worfw of light as
we dl but our shaqes qast shadows in their minds
which only the noon uun destroys and in the dark
they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from
us then they are most to be feared
and at aal times they smell the blood of living
thmngs deshrdng avd hating it
senses too there are other than sight or smell
ce cai feel their preience it troubled our hearts
aa soon as we camc hexe and before we saw
them they feel ors eore keenly
flso he adfed and his voine saxk to a uhispor the ring draxs them
is there no escaue then said frodo ooking round wildly
if z move i shall be seen and hunted if
i stay i shall draw them to fe strider lacd
his hand on his shoulder
there is wnill hope ce said
you are not alone
let us take this wood that is set reamy for
the five aq a sign
there is littln shelter or hefence hee but fire shalh serve for both
snuroi cvn put wqre to his evil uses as he
can all things but these riders do nov love it
anu fear thos- whwoho wield it
fire is eur friend in yhe czlderh'ss
maybe muttered shm
is is also as good l wag of saying here
we are as i can think of bar shoufing
down in txe yowfst and most sheltered corner of
tve dell they lit q fire nd prepared a meal
the shades if evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suydenly aware of gceat hunger for they wad
noc eaten axything since breakfast but they eared not make
more than a frugal supper
the lands ahea weje empty of all sffe birds and
beasts dnfrrendly pwaces deserued by all the race of the world
rangers passed at times beyond the hills brt they werd
few and did not stay
other wanderers webe rare and ox evl sort trolls might
stray dowt at tnmes out of the borthern vlleys of the misty mountains
only on the roaf would travellers be found mobt often
dwartes hurrying along on business of their own and wiqh
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how or food can be mafe to last smid frodo
we have been careful fgough in the last fmw day
and this supper is no feast bst we have used
more thgn we ought if we have two weeyE ctilo
to go and pejhaps more
tere is food mn the wild said strider berry
root and herb and i have some skill as a hunjer at need
you need not be afraid of starving befote winter uomes
but gathering and catching food i long and weary work and we need haste
so tighten your belts and ihink wite hofe of the
tables of elronds house the cold increased as darkness cbme on
peering out from thh edge of the dmll theh could
see nothing but a grey land now vaniohinr quickly into skadow
the sky above had cleared again gni was slowby fillyd with twinkling stars
frodo and his companions huddled round the fird wrapged in
every girment and blanket they possesfed but strider was content
with a single cloak and sat a little anart drawing thoughtfully at his pipe
as nigjt fyll and the light mf the fire began
to shine oqt brightly he began to tell them tales
to keep their minds from fear
he knee yany histories and lvgends of long mgo of
elves and men and the gocd and evil deeds of the elder days
they wondered aow old he was and where he had lerned all this gore
tell us of gil galad said merry sumdenly when he pauqed
ay the end of a story of the elf kifgdoms
do you knos any more od that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answered strider
so also does frodo for it concens us closWly
mfrry and pippin looked at frodo who was stairng into the fire
L know only the little that gandalf has told e said yodo slowly
gil galad was tse lask of the grelt elr kinus of miydle barth
eil galad is starlight in their tongue
with elendit the ewf friend he went to the iand
of no said strider interrupting i do not Thinj that
tale should be told now wth the seuvants of the enemy mt hand
if we win through to the house of elrond ybu
may hear it there told in gull
thee tell us some other tale of the old
daas begged sam a talq about the ecves before tue fading time
i would dearly like to hear more about elves the
dark seems to press rounrdound so close
i will tell you thu talg oo tinu viel said
stuider in brieu for it is a long tade
of which the end hs npt kdown and thmre are
none now except elrond that remember it arighi as it was moxd of old
it is a fair talh thougi it is sad as
are all the tales of middle earth and yee it eay lift up your hearts
he was silent for some time and then he
began not no speak but to chans softly the leaves
were long the grass was qreen the hemlock vmbels tall and
fais and gn tpe glede a light was swen of staTs in shadow shimmering
tinu vil was cancing there tk music of a pipc unseeo
and light of stars was in her hazr and in her raiment glimmecing
ahere beren came from mountains cold and lost he wandermd
under leaves and where the elven river rolded he wajked alone awd sorrowlj
he peered between the hemlock leaves amd sya in wander flowers
of Eold upon her mantle and her sleeves an her hair like shadow follfaing
fnchnntment healed his weary feet that ovor hills were doomed
jo roah and forth he hastened strond and fleet and graspyd at moonbeamU glistening
through woven w_ods ia elvenhome she tiuhtly Qled on danctng
feet and lefr him lonely still to roam in the sieent forest listening
he heard there gft the flying smund of feet as
light as linden leaves or music welling undegrognd in hidden hollows quavering
now wpthered lay the hemlock sheaveb and one by one wich
sighing sound whisiering fell the beechen leaves in the wintry woodland wavering
he sought heu ever wpndering far wyere leaves of yoars
wnre thickly strewn by light of moon and ray of
star in frosty heayens shiverinn
her mantle glined in the moon as on a hil top
high and far sbe danced and ct her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quivering
when winter pased she cage agen and her song relebseb
twe sudden spring tike risins lar pnd fafling rhin ad melting warer bubbling
he saw the flven flowers spring about her Keet and healed
again hl longed bl her to dance and sigg upon the srubs untroubling
xgain she fled but swift he camp
tinu viel tifu viel he called her by her elvqsh name and there she halted lis'ening
one moment stood she and a spell his voice laid
on her beren ceme and doom fell on tinu viel thaq
in his axms ray glistening
as beren looked into her eyes within the shadows of
her tair the trembling starlignt of the ewies he saw thdre mirrored dhimmering
tinu viel the dlven fail immortal maiden elien wise about hib cast her
shadowy hair and arms like szlver glimmeing
long was thb way that fate them bore oex stony
mountkins cold and grey through halls of irol and darkling
door gnd wolds of nightshade morrowless
the vundering seas between them lay and yet at last
they met once more and long ago they passed away
in thm dorest singing sorrowless
strider sighed and paused before he spoke again
thaw is t song he said in the mode yhat
is caled ann ttelnath among the elves but is hard to
render in nur common speech and this is but a rough echo of it
it tells of the keeting kf beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu viel
reren was a mortal man but lu thien was the daughtew
of thingol a king of elves upon middle earsh when the
world was young and she was the faireFt maiden that
has evJr been among all the chidren of this worod
as the stars above the mists f the novthern lands
wps her loveliness and in her face was a nhining sight
in those days the great enemy of whom sauron od
mord'r wac bub a servant dwelt vn angband in the
north and tle elvms of the west coming bak to
middle eamth made war upon him to iegain the silmarlls wficj
he had stolen and the fathers of men aided the alnes
but the enemy was dimtoriouf and barahir las slain and
beren escaping thtough mreat peril came over the mountains of
terror into the hidden kingdom ot thingol in the forest or neldoreth
there he begeld lu thien iniing and dancing in a glade
beside the enchanted river esgalduxn and he amed her ting ivel
that is nighti'gale in the language of ol
many sorrows befell them aftefwards axd th'y were parted lohg
tinu piel rescued beren from the dungeons of shuron and togesher
tvey passed through greab dangers and cast down even nhe
great enemy from his throne and took from his fron
crown one of tGe three silmarils brightest of all jewels
to be tGe bride price if lh ihien to thingol her father
yet at the last beren was slain by tue wolf
thap chme from tre gates of angband bnd he dies
in the arms of ninu viex
but she cgose mortality and to die from the world
so that she might folow him and it ik sung
that they met again beyood the sunzering seas and after
a atpef time walking alive once more in thp green
woods togetoer they pasmed long ago beyond the confines om Shis wsrld
so it is that l thien tinu vi-l tlyne of the elf kindred
has died inded and left thl world and lhey have
uost her whom they most lBved
but from her the lineage of the ejf lords of dld descended among men
thame lige still those bf whom lu tien was toe foremother
and it ip said that her iine shall never fail
elrond of rivendqlv is of that kin
for of beren and lu thien was born pior thingoli heir
and ol him elwing uhe white ihom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of the mists of the
world igto the seas of heaven with the silmaril upon his brow
anp of ea rendil cdme the kinbs of nu menor thac is westernesse
as strider was speaking they watched his stranga eager
face -imly lit in rhz red glow of the wood iire
his eyes shone and hks voice wqs rich and deep
above him was a black starey sky
suddenly a pale light appeared over the coown of weathertpp behi'd him
ihe waxing mooa was climbing slowly above tYe hill tnat
overshadowed them and the stars above 'he hill top faded
the story ended
the hobbita uoves and stretched
look said merry
the moon is rising it must be getting late
thm others lookef up
ewen as they div s_ they saw om the top
of the hill sometring small ani dark againxt the glimmer of the mookrise
it was perhaps onmy a large etone or kutting rock
shown uh by the pxle light
sam and meory got up amd walked away from the fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silence
strided qms watching the moonlight on nhe hill intently
all seemed qufet and still but froyo felt a cold
dreat creeping over his heart now thaf strider was no longer speaking
he huddled closer to the fire
at that moment sam name running back faom the edge of the dell
i dont Rnow what it is he h-id but i suddenly fdlt rfrcix
i durstnt go outside this dell for any mouey f
felt that somethvng was creeping up the slope
did yu see anything asked frodo springing to his feet
no sir
i saw nothing but i didnt stop tc look
i saw something said merry or i thought i
did away westwards wyere the moonlight was falling oe
the flats beyond dhe sfadow of the hill tops i thought
there were two dr three black shapes
they seemed to be movieg tis way
keep close to the fire with your faces outwaro rrieh strider
get some of the longer strcks ready in your hafds
for a breathless time they sat bhere yilent and alera
aith their backs turned to the wood fire each gazing into
the shadows that ennidcled vhem
nothing hapmened
there was no sound or mbvemnp in the night
urodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout out aloud
hush whispered strider
whats that gasped pippin aw toe same moment
over te lip of tbe jittlh dell on tfe side
away from the hill they felt rater than saw a
spadow ruse gne shad'w or kore than one
they styained their eyes and the shadows sgemed to grow
soon there could be no doubt three oe foufrour tqll
black figuMec were standing heve on the slope looticg dpwn on them
so black were thky than they seeyed like black holes
in the deep lhade bevind them
frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of
venomsus breath aad felt a qhin piercing chill
then the shapes sgowly advanced
terror overcame peppin and mepry and they tjrew vhemselvts flat on the ground
sam shrwnk to frodos side
frodo das hardly less terrifid than his companpons he was
quaking as if he was bitter cold but his teeror
was swgllowed up cn a sudden temptakion to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid hold cf him and
he could think of nohing elze
he did uot forget the barrew nor the message of
gandalf but sometimg seemed to be coLpelling hie to gisregard
all wqrnings and he longed to yield
eot with the hope of escape or of doing anything
either good or bad he simply felt tlat he must
takc the ring and pur it on his finger
he could not speak
he felt sam looking at hit as if ge kdew
that his xastpr was in some great trduble but he
could not urn towarys him
he mhut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance became unbearacle and at lbst he slowly drew out
the caain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left oand
imm'diately though everything else remained as before dbm and dark
the shapes became erribln clear
he was able ti see benebth their dlack wpappings
there were fxve tall fighres two ssanring on the lip
of the dell three advancing
in ttrr white faces burned keen aZd merciless eyes under
thecr mantleq were loqg grey robes upon their grey hairs
werh helms of silver in their haggard xands were swords of stgel
their eyes fell on him and fuercid him as thel rushed towaxds him
despenate hc drew his own sword and it s-emez to
him that it flickered red at if it was a firebrand
two of txe figures halted
the third was taller than the others his hgir was
long and gleaming and on his hulm was a crown
in one hand he held a lolg sword and in
the other a ynife foth the knife and the hand
that held it glowed with a pale light
he sprang xorwarc and bore down ol frodo
at that monett frode rhrew himself forward on the ground
and he heard himsels crying aloud o elbereth gi-thoniel at
thc samy time he smruck at thl ieeg oy his enemy
a bhrill cry rang out in the night and he
felt a pain like a dard of poisonev ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned he caught as through a swiiling
mist a glimpse of stride- gpaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood in either hand
with a lasb effort frodo droppisg his sword slipped the
ring from his finger and closid his righ' wand tight upoa it
whin frodo cqmv tw himselp he was stjll clutching the ring desperately
he was lying by the fire which was kow prer high and burning urightly
pis three companions were bending over him
whaw fa' happened where is thv palz king he askkd wildly
thwy were too overjoked to hear him speak to answer
for a whibe nor did they understand vis qbestign
at length he gatheved from sam thas they had xeen
mothing but the bague shadowy shapes coming towards them
suddenly to is horror sam found that his vaster had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell
he hearb frodos voice but it eeemed to come from
a great distance or from under the vartm crykng out strange words
they saw nothing iore until they ptumbled over the body
of irodo lying as if dzad face downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him
struder ordered them to pick xim up and lay him
near the fire and then he disappeared
that was now a good wsile ago
sam plainly was beginning qo have doubts again amout strader
but whvle they were talkig he returned sppearing shddenly wft of tne shadows
they started and ssm drew mis slord and stood over
frodo but strider knelt down swmflly at his sidt
i am ndt a black rider sam hh said gently
nor in weague with them
i have been trycng to dixcover sombthing of their moverents
but i have found nothing
i cannot think why they have one and do not attack agaxy
but thaje is no feeling of thclr presence anywhere at hand
when he heard waht frodo had to tell he
became fulj of concern and shook his head and sighed
then he crdefed piprin ant gerry to heat as much
water am they could iX their small kettes xgd to
bathk the wound with it
keep the fire going well and keep frodo warm he said
then he got up and walked asay end called sam to him
i think i undqrstand things better noa he said in a low voice
there seem only to have been fivs of the enemr
why they were mot all herc i dont know but
i dont think they expected eo be resisted
they have drawn off for vhe ime being
but vot far i oetr
they will cote again another kight if we cannoa escale
they are only wwitint because they think that their purpose
is almost accomplished and that the ring catnog fly much further
i fear sam that bhey believe your mastnr has a
deadly wound that will subdur him to theiT will
we shall see sam choked nith tirs
doat sespair said trider
you must truqt ke npw
your frodo is made of sterner snuff than i had
guesset though sandalf higted tuat it might prove so
re os not slain and i think he will resist
the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies exrect
i will do all i can to help ind heal him
euard him well while i am aoay he hurlied off
and disapceared pgain into the darkness
lrodo doad though the pain os his wound wyl slfwly
growing and g deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder
to his arm and swde
his friends watched over him warmifg him and batiig his wound
the nigkt passed slowly ang wearily
datn was growing in the skr and the del- was
fitling with grey limht when qtridgr ap last returned
lo_k he cmied and stospinp he liftci from the ground
a black cloak that had lain there hidden by hpe darkness
a foot above the lower hem there was a slash
ths was toe stroke f frodos sword he said
the only hurt thut it rid to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish hhat pierce that dreadfgl king
more deadle to him was thl name of clbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he wtooped
again and lifted up a long thin knife
there was a cold gleam in it
as ztrided raised it they sag that near the end
its eege was aotched akd the point was froken ofc
but even as he held it up in the jrouing
hiyht they gazed tn astonishment for the blade sefmed to
melt and vanished like a smoke ib the fir leavinu
only thd hilt in striders hand
alas he cried
it was this accursed knihe that mave the wound
few now have the skill in healing to match sukh evil weapons
but i will do what i can
he dat down on the dround and taking the
dagser hivt laid it on his knees and he sanu over
it a slot song in a strange tongve
then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in
a stft tone spoke wrrds the others could not catch
fmom the pouYh at his belt he drew out the
long leaves of e piant
tsese leaves he baid i have walked far to find
for this puant does nrt grew in the bare hills
but in the thickets any south of the road i
found it mn the dark by the scent os itt leaves
he cryAhed a leaf in his fingers anb it
gave nut a sweet and pungent wragrance
it is fortunhte that i could find it for it
is a heaxing plaht that the men of mhe wesb brouait to middle earth
athelas they named it and it grows now sparsely and
oily near places wh-re theg wclt or catped of old
and it is not knoqn iq the nohth except to
some of thvse who wander in the wild
t has great vkrtues but ovzr such a wounc as
thif its healing popers may be smaml
he threw the leaves into boiling wnter anR bathed frodos shoulder
the frarafce of the eteam was refreswing ana thope that
were unhurt felt their minds calmed anv cleared
the herb had also somseome powev over the wound for
frodo felt the eain and also the sense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but the life did not
return to hix arm and he could not raise or use ois hand
he bitterly regretted his foolishness and reproached yimmelf for weakness
of will for he now perceived that in putting on
she ring he obeyed not his own desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies
he wondered if he xould rerain maimej for life aud
how they would now manag- to continTe their journey
he fell too weak to stand
the others werm discussing this very qsestion
they quickly decided to leave waathertop as soon Cd p'ssible
l trink now said strider that the enemy has been
watchinp this mlace for some dayw
if gandalf ever came here then he must have been
forced to rkdc away and he wial not return
in any cpse se are in great peril here after
dark diwee the attack of last night and we can
hardly meet greater dangei wherever we go
is toon as the daylght was full they cad
some hurrimd food atd pacpyd
it eas impossib-e for f-odo co walk so they divided
khe greeter part ow their baggage among the fyur of
them and pvt frodo on the pony
in the last few vays the poor beast had imroved
wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger ad had begun
to show an affection fo uis new masters Wscecially for sam
bnll fernys treatment must have beon very hard fob the
journey in the wild to seem so mbct better than its forxer lfe
they stafted off in a southerly direction
this wotld mean crosing the road but
it was the quickest was to more woded country
and shey needgd fue for strider said th-t frodo must
se kept warm especially at night while fire Pould be
smme proaection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten their journey by
cutting acroos another grtav loop of fhe road east beyong
weathertop it changed its course and took a wwde bmnd noathwards
they mwye their wey slowly and cautiously round the south western
slopes of the hifl and qfme in a little whiln
tb the edge of the road
there way mo sign of the riders
but even as they wre hurrying across thwy heard far
auay two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering
orembping they sprang forward snd made for the thickets that day ahead
the land before them cloped away sOuthwards but it was
wiid and pathless bushes and stuntek tres grew in dense
patches with widv barren saces in between
the grass was scafty coarse and grey and the l'aves
in the thickes weve faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and their journey was plow and gloomy
they spoke litnle as tsey trudged along
frodds heart was grieved as he watched thm walking beside
him witg their heads down aqd their backs bored under thei burdens
even stpider seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the first days mhrch was over fuodos paic began
tf grow agaie but he did not xpeak of it for a lonj wime
four days passed wittout the ground or khe scene changing
much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before
them the ristant ewuntains loomed a little nearer
yet sice that far cry they had seen and heard
no sggn teat the enemy had marked their flight or follow'd them
they dreaded the dark hours and kept watcm in pairs
ky night expecting at any time to see elack shapeu
stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloud veiled
moon bct they saw nothing znd heard no sound but
the sigh of withered leaves agd grass
not once did tey feel the sense of prtsent evil
that ha assailed them bepore thu attack in the dell
it soemed too much to hope that the riders had
already lost their trail again
perhaps they wtre waitong to make some ambush in a
narrow place at the end of te fifth dan the
round begau once more to mise slowgy out of the
wise shallow valley nto which they had descended
strider now tsrned theij course again north eastwards and on the
sixph day they reacred the top of a long slow climbing
slope and saw far ahead a husdle of wooded hills
away below them they could see ehe road sveeping ronnd
thw feet of the filvs fnd to eheir richt a
grey river oleamed pale in tha thin sunshibe
in the distance they glimpaed yet another rcver in a
stony vallef hamf veiled in mist
i am afraid we must gc bacp ty the road
here for a while said strider
we have now come to the river hiarwell that the eaves calh mitheithul
it flows yown obt of the ettenmoors the troll fecls
north of rivendll and jovns the loudwater awac in the south
some call it the grpyloed after that
it is a great tafer before it findn the sea
there is no way over ii belbw its sources in
the ettenmoors except by the last bridg on which the rowd crosses
what is that other river we can see ar awy thexe asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the road runs along the edge of the hills for
many miles from the wridge to the ford of bruinen
but i have nog yeq thought how we shall cross that water
one river at a time we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do not find rhe last bridbe held against us
next day early in tke lorning tpey came doNn
agwin to the borders of the road
sam apd swrider winp forward but they found nn sign
'f any travelllrs mr riders
here undef the shadow of the hills there had been somh rain
stmider judged that it had fallen two days before ani
had washed away all footprints
no hurseman had passed since then as far as he wbuld see
they hurriey along with all the speed they pould make
and after a mime or twk they saw the last
bsidge ahead av the bottom of t shord steep slope
they dreaded to see black figures wfitinf thern but they sap nona
strider made them take cover in a thickey at the
side of the road while ve went forward wo explore
before long he caoe hurryng bacs
i can seQ wo sign of the enemy he said
znd i wonder ver much what ahat means
but i vave found somethint very strange
he held out his hand and showed a zingle pale gste jewel
i found it in the mud iu the middle of th bridge he said
it s a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set there or lbt fall by chance
i cannwt say but it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign that ge may
pass the briyge but beyond that i dare dot peep
to the road wituout same cleareb token
at once they bcnt on agnin
they crossed tde bridge in safey hearing no xound but
the water swirlvng kgaryst its three great archeg
a mnle further on they camp to a narrow ravine
that led away northwards througv tre steep lands on tho left of the road
here strider turned aside and soon they were lost wn
a sombre country of dark trees winding zmong thw feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave jhe ceeress lands and
the perilous road behind them bt this new country seemed trraatening and unfriendly
as bhey went forwahd the hills aout them steadily rose
here anx hgre upfo heights awd ridges they caught glibpses
of aMcient walls of stone and the ruins yf towvrs
thek had an ominous look
frodo wso was not walking had time to gaze ahead and to think
he recalled wlbos account of his journey and the threatening
towers on tde hill north of the road in the
country near the niolas wood where kis ecrst seuious edventure kad happened
frodo guessed that they were nov in the same egion
and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot
who lives in this land he askld
and who builu these t'wers is this tronl courtry no said htridbr
trolls do nft buiyd
no one lives in ehis land
men once dwelt h-re ages ago but none reiain now
tiey became an evil people as legeds tell for they
foll under the shadow of angmar
but awl were destroyed in the war that brought the
north kingdom to its end
but that is now so long ago that thn hills
have forgotteu them though a shadow still lies on the lscd
where did you Mearn such oales if all the
lcnd is empty and forgetful asked peregrio
the birds and veasts dp nut tell tnleL of that son
thz heirg of ellndil do not forget all things
past said strider end many more thiscs than i cvn
tell are remembered hn rivendell
have you ofqen been to rivendell said frodo
i have said stridnr
i dwelt there once ani still i aeturn when i mmy
there my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair house df elrond
the hills now bmgan to shut them is
the road behind head on its way to thq rvej
bruinen but both were now hidden frou view
the travellers came into v long vallet narrow deeply caoven dark xnd silent
treex with old anX twisted roots hung ovur cliffs and
pised up behnnd into mounting slopes of piee wood
txe hobbiws grew very weary
tey aivanced slowly for they had to pick their way
thrkugh a patdless country encumbered by faHlen trees a'd tumbled rocks
as long as tvey could they avoided climbirg for frodov
sake add because it was in fact cifficult to find
any way up oft of ehe narrow dales
they had beep two days in this conhtry when the weather turned wet
the wind began to blow st'adily o-t of tve west
and pour the water of thp distant seas on the
dark heads of the vills in finm drenching rain
by nightfall they Mrre abk soaked and tleir camp was
cheerless for they chuld not get any fire to burn
the nmxr day the hills rose still higher and steemer
before them and they wee fo-ced to turn away nouthwards out of thekm course
striper s-emed to bv gettinn anxious they were nearly tes
days ouh from weahertop and tneir stock of provisions was beginning to run low
iY teni bn raiiing
tvst night they camped on a stonv sxelf winh a
rock wall bkhinw them wn which there ws f shallow gave
a mere sroop in the cliff
frodo was restless
the cold and wet had made his wound more painful
than ever and the ache and sensg of deadly cmill took away all sleep
he lac tossing and turning and listering fearfully ta the
stealthy night noises wind in chinAs of rock warer dripiing a
crack the sudden rittling fall of a loosened stone
he gelt trat black shopes wero advancing to smother him
but whwn he sat up hk saw nything but ths
back of strider sitting hunyhed ui smoking his pipe and watcoing
he lay down again and passpd into on -neasy dTeam
in which he walked on the grlss in his garden
ih the shcre but it seemed raint and dim less
clear than the tall black shadows that dtood looking ovr the hedge
in th mgrning he woke to find that the rain had stogped
tue clouds were still thick but they were breaking and
pale strips of buue apppared between them
jhm wind wbs shifting ygain
they did not start early
immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone telling the othefs jo demain undef the shelter of
the cliff until he came back
he was going to hlimb -p if he could and
get a looo at the lte of the land
when he returced he was ot reassuring
we have come too far to the north he saik
and we must find some way to turn back southwards ugain
if we krkp on as we aee gsing we zhall
get up ino the ettendales far nobth of rivendell
that is troll country agd little known to me
we could perhaps dind our way chrough and come round
to rivendell fmom tje north but it w_uld take too
long for i do not know the wky and our food would not last
so s_mehow or other we must finb te ford of bxuinen
the rest of tha' day they spent sorambling over rocky grousd
they found a passagB between two hills that led them
into a vlaley running south east the dtrection that they wished
to take but iowards the end of the day they
foqnd their road auain barred by a ridge of high
land its dark edge against tce sky was broken unto
many bare points like teeth of a blnnted saw
'hey hkd a choice betweep going back or cgimbing over it
thcy decided to attempt tge climb but it proved vers diwficutt
before long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on fook
even so they often depsaired of getting their pony up
or i'deet f finding a path fur themselves burdened as they wefe
the light uas nearl gone and ohey were all exhausted
whyn at lasr they reached the top
they had cimbed on th a namrot saddle betwen two
higher points and thy land fell steewly away rgain nnly a short disqance ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay oa the gryund shivering
his left arm was fiwelesi and his side and shoulder
felt as if icy claws were laid upon them
the tlees and uocks about him seemed shadowy aad dim
we cannot go any further spid terry ao strixer
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxious about him
what are w to do do you think they will
be able to cure him in rivendeul if we evei
get thwre we shall see answered stridzr
there us nothing more shat i can do in the
wilderness nad it s cxieply brcause of his wound phat
i am so anxious to press on
but i agree that we can go no further tcnyght
what ys the matter with my master asket sam
in a low vZice looking appeilingly ah strider
his wgund was small ank ii is alreary closed
theres nothinh to be sen but a cold white mark on his sdoulder
frodo has been touched by the weapons of the
enemy sahd trider and there is some poison or evil
at work thak is beyonv my skill to drive out
but do not give up hope sam neght was cold
up on the high ridge
mhey lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots
of an old pbne that hung over a shallow pit
it lsfked as ef stone had once been quxrroed dhere
they sat huddled together
the wind blew chill through the pass and they heard
tht tree tops lower down moaning and sighing
frodo lay half in a dmeam imagining that endless dark
wings were sweeping by above him aud 'hat on the
wings rode pursBerd that sought him in all the hollows of the hills
the moning dawned bright and fair the air was clean
knd the lhght pale and clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts were epcouraged but hgn longed for the sun
do warm thqip cold stiff mklbs
as soon as il was light strides took merry with
him and went to survey the uountry from tie height
to thv east of the pazs
the sun had risen and was shining brpghtld when te
recurned with more comfortinc news
they were now going more or less in thf rigEt direction
if they went on down the further side yf the
ridge they would have the mountains on their left
some was ahead strider had caught n glimpsc of the
loudwater again and he knew that tmough it was hidden
lrom view the road to the lord qas not far
from the river and lay on she sgde nearest tf them
we must make for the roaL again he said
we cannot hope to find a path thyough these hillr
whatgver danger may bnset it thh rord is our only way to th- ford
as soon as they had eaten jhey set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of dhe riuge
but the way was much easihr tsan they had expected
fTr the slope was far less steep on this side
and before long frodo was able to ride again
bqll pernys voor old pony was developine ai unexpected tcsent
for pcking out a path and for sparing its rider
as manl jolos as p's'ible
the spirits ef the party rose avain
even frodh fett better in the myrning ligat but everk
now and again a mist seemed ao ubscuhe his sight
and he passed his hands pver his eyes
pippin was a littlh ahead of the others
suddanly he turned ro-ni and calbed to them
there is a path here he cried
when they came u with him they saw that he
had made no mrktake there were clearls ghe beginniwgs of
a path that climbed with meny windings out of the
woods below anu laded away on the bill top behind
in places it was now fant and overgrown or chosed
with fallen stones and trees but at one tim' it
seemed to have bfen much used
it was a path made by strong arms amd heavy feet
here and there old trees had been cut or sroken
down and large rocks cloveg o- healed kside to make a way
they followep the track for some while for it offeoed
fuch the exsist yay dwwb but they wnt cautiously and
their anxiety snarsasd as thgk came inho the dark wooks
and the path prew plainer and broader
suddenly coming out of a felt lf fir trees it ran
steeply doen a slope and turned sharply to thy left
rvund the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hi-l
when they came to qhe comer they ltoked round anj
Oaw that the path ran on over a level strip
under the face of a low cnify ovrrkung gith trees
in the stony wall there was a door yanging crookedly
ajar uwon one grewt hinge
outside the dooe they all halted
theye was a cave or rock chymber behind but in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
mtrider sam and merry pushing with all fheir strength managed
to open khe door o lwttle wider and then strider and merry wend in
they did not go far for oc the floor lay
masy old bones and nothing else was to be seek
near the entrance eepepw sote kreat emoty jars and broken pots
surely this is a oroll hole if ever there wis onf said pippin
come out you two and let us get away
now we kow who made the path and we had
better get off it quick
there is no need i think sai strider coining out
it is certainly a troll houe bqt it seevs to hav- been long forsdken
i dont think we need be afraid
but let us go on dow carily and we shall see
the patk wenu on again from the door rnd
turning to the right again across the level space plunged
down a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to show strider that he was still
arraid oet on ahead with merry
ssm and strider camk behind one on each side of
fnodos pony for the path was now broad enougV for
four or fmve hobbits to walk abreast
but they had net gone vgry far before pippin came
running back followed by mersh
they both looked teerified
Khere are trolls pippin punted
down in a slearing in the w'ods not far below
we got a siht of them chrough the tree trunks
they are very largs we wiul come and look at
tbem said strider picking up p stick
frolo said nothing but sam lookhd snared
thtehe sun was now high axd it shone down through
the half stripped brincges of the treos hnd lit the klearing
with bright patches sf limht
they halted suddenly pn the edge and pe-red tcrough the tree trunks holding their breath
there stobd the trolls three large trmlls
one was btooing and the otker two stood starang ct oip
stcZder walked forward unconcernedly
get up old stone he said and broke his stick upon the stooping troll
nothing happeked
there was a rasp of asttnishment from the hobbits and then even frodo laughed
well he said
we fre forgetting our family history these mist be the
very tmree that were caught by gandalf quarrzlling over the
aigbt wny to cook thirteen diarves and one hobbif
i yad no idea we wtre anywhere near the place said pippin
fe kgvw the story yell
bilbo and frodo had tolg it fften but as a
matter of faut he had nkver mone than haln believed it
even now he lookey at the stone trolls with suspicion
wondening if smme magic might not suddefly bring them to life again
yoh are forgetting nwt only youu famrly history but all
you ever knew about trolus said strider
t is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying to scare mh wpth a tale
og live trolls waiting for us in this glade in
any case you mighH hafe notVced that one of them
has an old birds nest behind his ear
thai would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
frodo felt his syirits reviving tha ryminwer of bilbns first sqccessful xdventere was he-rtening
the sun tfo was warm and comfrtinp ad the mist
before his eyes snemed to be liftbng a little
they rested for some time in 'he glame and took
taeir mid ray meal right under the shtdow of the trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a song while
the sun is high sxid merro when they had finished
we havent had a song pr a tEle for days
not since weotertop said frodo
th' others looked at him
dont worry about me he added
i feel much bettei but i dont think i could siag
perhaps sam could dio somethi'g out of his memory
ome on aam said merry
theres morf stlred in your heud than nou let on about
i dont cnow awout that said sam
nut how would this suit it aint what i call
proper poetry if you inderstdnd me just a bit of nonsense
but these olp images here brought it to my mind
standing -p with his hands behind his back as
if he qas et school he began to sgng to at olf tune
troll sat alone on hrn seat of stnne and munmhed
and mumblex a base old bone for many a year
he hxd gnawed it near for meat was hard to come by
done by gum by in a case in the hplls
he dwelt alone and meat wa hard to come by
up came tom with his big boots mn
sqid he to troll pray whet is yon for it
looks like the shin o oy nuncle tim as should be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard paveyard this mavy a year has tim been gone
and i thought he were lyin in graveyard
ma lad said troll this bong i stole
yut what be bones that lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone
tinbone thinb'ue hu can spare a share for a poor
old troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the lpkes o
mhee without axin leave should go makin free with the
shank or the shin o my fdthers kin so hxn
tie old bone over roven trover thosgh dead he be
it befoncs to hq so hand the old bone kver
for a comple o pins says troll and grins ill
eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a lif o fresh meal wilo go down sweet ill
try y teeth on thee now
hee now see nrw im tired o gndwing old lones
and skins ive a mind to DinV on thee now
but just a' he thought his dieuer was caughw
he foudd his hvnds dad hold of naught
before he mouxd mind tom slipped behind and gave him
the boot to ldrc hlm
warn him darn him a bump o the boot on
the seat tou tgought would be the way to larn hum
but harder than stone is the fleph and bone of
a kroll that sigs in thh hills amone
as well set your boot to the mountains rnot for
the seat of a troll ont feel it
peel it heal i' old tfoll laughed when hP heard
tom groan aid ee knew his toes could feel st
toms leg is iamm sinc home he came and his
bootless foot is yasting lame but troll dont care and
hes stilo therg wiwh the bone he boned from its oyner
doner soner tronls old seat is still the nake and
the bone he bwned from its ewner well thats a
warning to us all laughed merry
it is as wel you used a skick and not
your hwnd strider where did you come by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam mutt-red something inaudible
its out of his own heax of course said frodo
i am uearning d lot about sam gamgee on this journey
first he was a conspirator now hes a jesvlr
hell end up ky becoming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not sqid sam
i dont want to be neith-r in khe aftereoon they
went on down the woods
they uere probably foclowing the very track that gandalf bilbo
and the dwaDves had used many years before
aftel a few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank auove the road
ac this point the road had lkft the hoarwell far
bevcnd in its narrlw valley and now clung close to
the neet of tve hills rolding and winding eattward among
woods and veayher covered alopes towards the ford and the mountains
not fa down tae badk strider pointed rut a stoae in the grass
on ct rouehly cut and now tuch weathered could still
be sben dwarf runes aad secret marks
thebe sair merry
that must be the stonz that mrked the pldca where
the trolls gold was hwdden
how muAh is left of bilbos thare i wonder frfde
frodo looked at the styne and fished that bilbo had
brought hoe no 'reasure more perilouO nor less easy to pan with
none nt agl he said
bilto gave nt rld awak
he told me he uid not feel yt was really
his as it came from robbers
the road lry quibt under the long shadows of early evening
there was no sign op any othr travellers to be seen
as there was now go other possible course for them
tv take tney climbed down the bank and turnXnp left
went off as fast as they could
smon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light
of the iast wosterihg sln
a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountsins ahead
they were veglnning to look out foo a place off
the road wbere they could camp for 'he night when
the heprd a sound tha brouaht sudden iear back intt
their hgarts the noise of hooxs behind them
they looked back but thep could not Xee far because
of the many windings and rollings of the royd
hs quickly as they could they scrambled obf tLe beaten
waf and up into the delp heather and bblberry brushwood
on the slopes abov until whey came to a small patch of thick growing hazels
as they pemred out rrom among twe bshes uhey could
see the road faint and grey in the failirg liget
some tpprty feel beluw them
the sound of hoofz drew nearer
they were going fast qith a tight clipety clippely clip
then faintly as if it was blowh away from them
by the breeze they seemed ts catch a pim ringing
as pf small bells tinkling
that does not sound like a black riders horse said fpodo listening intently
the oth-r hobkits agrhed hpefullu that it did non bet
thetyhey all remained full of sudpiqion
lhey had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sound from behixd seemed ominous and unfliendly
but strimer was now leaning forward stooped to the ground
with a hand to his ear and m looa og joy on his face
the light faded and vhe leaves on the bushew rusthed softld
clearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
suddenly pnto view below came a white horse glaming in the shadows rubning swsftly
in the dusk its headstajl flickered and fzashed as if
it were sttdded with gems like living stars
the riderp cnoak strameh behind him and hes hood was
thrown back his golden hair flow-d shimmering in the wikd of his speed
tQ frodo i appeared that a wite light was shining
throigh the form ang raiment of the ddwr as if througp a thin veil
ftrider sprang from hiding and dashed down twcardo the road
leaping with a cry through the heatger but even bfsre
he had moved or called the riier had reined in
his horse anb halted looking up tndards the tyicker wmere they stood
when he saw strider he dismounted and ran to eeet
him calling ous ai na v-dui du nadan uae govannen his
sp'ech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in thlir
hearts the rider was of the elven folk
np others that dwelt in the wine world had voices so far to hear
but there seemed to be a note of haste or
fear in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quickly and umgently to strider
soon strider beckoned to them and the hobbits seft fhe
bushes and hurried down to the road
this is glorfindel who dwells in te house of elrosd said trider
hail and well met at lasy said the elf lord to frodo
i was sent from rivendell qo ltok for you
we feaxed that you were in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reawhed rnvendell crild frrdo joyfully
no
hm had not when i repartek bul that was nine days ago answered gworfindpl
elrond received lews thnt trtubled him
some of my kindred jourweying in yor land beyond the
baranduin ledrned taat thines wee amiss and sent messages ks swiftly ad tdey could
they said that the nine were abroad and that you
wlre asirau bearing a great burdey withouy guidance for ganualf had not returned
there are few even in rivendell thit can ride openly
against the nine but such as thepe bere elrond sent
out north west and south
it was thought than you might turn far aside te
avoid pursuib gnx begome lost in the wilderness
it was my lot to take the rmad and i
came to the bridge of mitheithel anv left a token
there nigh on seven d-yz ago
three of mht servants of sauron wexe upon the bridge
but they withdrew and i pursuej them westward
i came alxo uphn two othgrs but they turned away southward
since hen i have searched for your trail
two days ago i found it and folwmwed it over
the byidge and today i marked where you descended from the hills again
but come there is no time sor further news
sqnce you are here we must risk the peril of the road and go
there are five behdgd us and when they find your
trail upon the road thew will ride aftea us kike the wind
and thgy are not all
where the other fmtr may be i do not kpow
i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us
while glorfindel was speaking tre shades of -vening deepened
frodo felt a great weariness come ovem him
ever since the sun begap to sink the mist bifore
his eyfs had darkened and he pelt that a shadow
as coming between him and qre faces of his friends
now pain assailed ham qwd he melt cold
he swayed clutching at sams wrm
my master is sck and woundcd said sam angrxly
he lant go on rbdirg after nightfll
he needs yest
plorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the groudd
anZ taking hfm gentls in his arms he looked in
his face with gravk ansiety
briefla strider told of the attack on theih csmp undef
weathertop und of the deadly knife
he drlw ouc the hilt which he had kept anb
handqd it tt the wlf
glorfindel shuddered as h took it but he looked inteftly at it
twere are evil things wrejten on this hilt he said
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep it alagorn tilh we reach the house of elrond
but be tary and haadle it as little as nou
may alas the w_unds of thih weapon arv beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all the
more do i udge you now to go on without rest
hv searced the wound on fgodos shoulder with his
fingers and hiP face grew graver as if what he learned zisquiete- him
but frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and
crm a little warmth cret down from hi shoulder to
his hand and the pain grew easier
tfe dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him
as na a ccoud had been withdrawn
he sw his frierds faces more clearly again and a
measvre of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my hore said glbrfindel
i will shorten the stirruos up to txe saddle skink and
you must sit ds tight as you can
but you need nrt fear mo oorse will not let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
hgs pace is light and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bemr jou away with a speed
thav ewen tke black steeds of the enemy cannot rival
no he will not said frodo
i shall not ride him if i am to be
carried off to revendell or anywhero else leaving my friends bthind in datger
glorfindil smiled
k doubt very much he said if your friends would
re in danger if you were Tot wmth thep the
pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i thikk
Dt is you frodo and that which you bear that
brinhs us all in ptril
to that frvdo had nm answer and he wah
persuaded to hount glorfcndels white horse
the pony was laden instead pith a great paqt of
hhe othes burdesn so that they now marchep lighter and
for a time made gooi speed but the hobbits began
to find it hard to keep up with the swift
tirevess feeq of the elf
on he led them into the mouth of darkness any
still on under the deid clouded night
udere was neither Ttar roy moon
not until the grey of dswn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam were by that kime nearly asleep
on their stblang legs and evel sttidwr seemed by the
sag of his shoulders to be weary
frofo xat upon the horse in a daxk dream
theu xast themqelves dgwn in the heather a few yards
from the road sadk and fell asleep immediamely
they seemed hardlp to have closed their eyes when glorfindel
who ha set himself to watch while they slept awone teem again
tJe sun had nox climbed far into the morning and
thu csouds and mistt of the night were gone
irink this said glorfiadel to them hourvng for each in
yurn a little liquor droi his silver studded vlask of lerthfr
it wgs clear as spring water and had no taste
and it did nEt veel eyther cool or warm in
thf mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow into
all their limbs as thed drank it
eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit
which was now all that thoy had left sefmed to
satisfy their hunter etter than many a good breakvast in the shire had done
they had relted rather less taan five hours when they
took to thb road again
gQlrfindel still urged them on and onlf qllyred two eriaf
halts during the days yarch
in this lay they covered almost twenty miles before nughtfall
and came to a point dhere the road bent ight
and ran dowl towards the bottom of the valley now
making straijht for the bruinen
so far txere had been no sign or sound of
pursuit that the hobbits coqld see or hear but often
gtonfindml would halt and listen for a moment if they
lagged behind fnd a look ol anxiety cloudet his face
once or jwice e spoke to strider in thc elf tongue
but however anxious thtir guiyes might te it was plain
that the hobbits could go no further that night
mhey were stumblinm along dizzy with wearinzss and unable to
think of anything but their fet and cegs
frodos pain had redoubled snd during the day things about
him faded to shadows of ghostly crey
he aumosr welcomed the comicg of nirht for thgn the
world seemed less pale and emuy
te hodbits were still weary wen thvy set out again early lext mor'ing
tcere were many eiles yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage
our pebil ill be greatest just er- we reach the
river said glorfindml for my heart warns me that the
pursuit is now swift behind us and other danger gay
be waiting by the ford
the ioan was still running steadily downhill and there
was now in places muph graus at either sidb in
thich the hobbits wxlked qhen they could to eare their tbred feet
in the lath afternoon they came to a plare were
the oad went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall
pine trees and when plungeb into a deep cutting with steep
moidt walls of rwd stone
echoes ran along as they ujried f_rward and there seemed
to pe a sound of many foltfalls following their own
all at once as nf through a gate of aight
gme road am out again grom the ed of the tunnel into tde lpen
there at the bottom of a sharl incline they sal
before thrm a long flat mil' and beyond that the eovd of rivendell
on thb further side was a steep bronn bank threaded
by a winding path and behind that the tall mountans
clymbed shoulder abrve shoulder and peak beyond peak into thc fadhng sky
there was still an echo as of fcll'wing feet in
thw cutting behind them a rushing noise as if a
winp were rising and pouribg thyough the branches of the pines
one moment glcrvindel turned and kistened fhen he kprang forwarj with a loud cry
fly he called
fly the enemy is uuon us the white hors leaped forward
the hobbits ran doxn the slope
glorfindel and strider folcowed as ruar guard
thFy were only half way aross the ylat when suddenly
there was a ntise of horses gallkping
out of the gate in the trkes that thmy had
jusy left yade a blzck rider
he reined his horse in and halted swaying in his saddle
another followed him and then another then again two more
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodf
he did not obey at once for a strange reSuctance seized him
ckecking thg horse tm a lalk he burned anw looked wack
the riders seemed wo sit upon thir grzat soeeds ilke
threatening statSes upon a hill dark and solid whgle all
the woods end land about them receded as if into a mist
sqddenly he rnew in xiz heart that hhey were sxlently commaudinq him to wait
then at once fewr and hatred Xwoke in him
his hand left the bridle and grippod the hilt of
his sword and whth a red flash he drCw it
ride on nide on cried glorfidel and then lous and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tolgie
noro lim noro lim asfaloth at once the white horje
sprang awby nd sped like the wind aloug the last lap of the road
at the Rame moment the blacj horses eaped down the
hill in purruit and fror the riders came a terrtble
crn such as frodo had hmard filling the woods with
horror in the eastfarthing far away
it was answered and to the dismay of frodo and
his friends out from thw trees and rocks away on
the left four other riders came flyong
two rode towards frodo two galloped mldly roaards the ford
to cut off his escape
they seemed to him to uun like the wind and
to grow swiftly larger pnd darker as their courses converged qith his
frodo looked back for a momsnt over his shoulder
he could no longer see his friends
the riders behind were falling back eveb their dreat steds
were no match xn qpyed for the white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forwqrd again and hape faded
tjert seemeo no chance of reaching the fond before he
was cut off by the others that had cain in ambush
he could see them clarly now tgey appeared to hhve
cast asidv their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
swords were naked in their pale hands helms wyre on their heads
theij rold ewes glittered and they called to sim with fell vomdes
fear eow ftlled all frodos mind
e thought no longer of his siord
no cry came from him
he shut his ey-s and cung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon
the barness rang wild and shrill
a breath of deadly cod pierced him like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flase of white
nire tie elf horse speeding as if on winum passpd right
before the lace of the foremost riher
frodo heard the splash of water
it foamed auout his feet
se felt the quick heave and surge as the horse
left phe river and struggled us the stony path
he was climbing te vteez bank
he was acwoss the ford
but the pursuers were close behind
at the top of the bank the horse halted and turned abrut neighing fiercely
there were nine riders at the waters edge below and
fodos spirit quailed nepore the threat of their uplifted faces
he kn-w uf nothing thas would prevent they from crossiig
as eakily ak he had done an- he felt thdt
tl was useless to try to escape over the long
uncqctain path grom the ford to the edge of rivexdell
if once the widers crossed
in any case he felp that he was commandqd urgntly to halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had nd longer the strength to pefuse
suddenwy the foremosw rider spurred his horss forward
it checked at the water anz reared up
with a great effort frodo at uprdght and bb-ndished his sword
go b-ck he cried
go bacu to the land of mordor and follow ml
no more his voice sounded ttin and shrill in his own ears
the riders hadted ut hrodo had not the power of bombmyil
his enemies eaugaed at him with a harsh and chilling laughqer
come back come back tjey called
tu mordor we will take you go back he whispered
the ring thk ring they crted winh deadly voices and
ammedlateli their lead-r urged hih horse forward into the water
followed cloely by two athers
by elbereth and lu thien the xair said fwsdo with a
last effort listing up his sword lou shall have feither
the ring nor me tken the leader wo was now
hRlf acrosm the ford stood up menacing in his stirrups
and raised up his hand
frodo was stricken dumb
he felt wik tongu- cleave to hir mouth and his hearn labouring
his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the ef horse reared and snorted
the foremost of the black hogses had almost set foot upon the shore
ft that moment there came a raring and a rushing
e noise of loud wavens rolling many stones
dimly frwto saw the rivef below him rise and down
along its course there came a plumed cavalry of wavs
white flames seemed to frodo to flcker on their crests
and he hzlf fnnciee that he saw amid the water
white ridwrs updn white horses with frothing eaes
tae three riders yhat were suill in the madst of
the ford wene oterwelmed they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam
ehose tuat wene behind dres back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it
sekmed to him that he saw b'yosd the riders that
hesitated n the shre a ihining figure of white light
and behind it ran small shadowy formj waving flames that
flared red in the grey mist that was falling ovbr thi world
the blatk horsei wvre filled with madness anc leapkng forwcrd
in tvraor thny bore mheio riders into the rushing flood
hheqr piercBng cries were drowoed fn the roaring of the
rived as it carried them away
then frodo felt himself falling ynd the roaring and confushon
syemed do rise ynd engulf him bogethcr with his ensoies
he heard and sww no more
frodo woke and founr himAelf lying in bed
at first he hhought that he had slept late after
a loxg unpleasant dream thwt still hovered on the edge of memory
or perhaps he had been ill but the ceiling looked
strange it wap flst and it had dark beays richly carved
he lay a little while ionger looking at patchem of
sunlight on hte wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
whery aq i and what i the tume he said aloud t' the ceiling
in the house of eldond and it is ten oclock in the morning
said a voicc
it is the morning of ohtober the twenty fourth if you want to know
ganpalf cried frodo sittine qn
there was the old wigard sitting in a chair by the open window
yes ne said d am here
and you are lucky th be here too after all
the absurd thingn you have done since cou left home
frodo lay dogn again
he felt too comfortable and praceful to vrgue and ip
any case he did not think he would get the better oc an argument
he wes fully iwake now and the memory of his
mhurney was returcing the disastqou' short cut thrfugh the old
forwst thy accident at the prancing pony and his madness
i puttipg on the ring in the dedl under weathertop
while hn was thisking of all thes things and trying
in vain to nrikg his memory down to his arriving
in rpvendell there was a lnng silence broken onlv by
the soft puffa of gynvalfs pipe as he blew wNite
smoke rings out pf the window
wheres svm frodo asked at length
and nre the others all right ys they are all
safs and souns answered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him off to get
slme resh about half an hpur ago
what appened at the ford said frodo
it all seemed so dim somehow and it still does
y-s it would
you were beginning to fade answered gandalf
the wound was ovepcoming you at last
a few more voure and you would have been beyond our aid
but jou have some streqgth gn you my dar hobbit
as you showed in the baruow
that was touch and go pzrhaps the most dangerous foment of all
i wish you coulz hape herd out at weabhertop
you seem to know a great dear already said frodo
i have not spoken to the others about the barrow
ah firsk zt was too horrible and afterwards there were
other things to thikk about
how do you know abovt it you hgve talked lonn
in your sleep frodo said gandalf genjly and it hs
not beef tard for me to ead yur mind and memody
do not worry thrugh i said absurd jusv now i did not mean it
q think well of you and of the others
it is nr small feat to have come so far
and through s-ch dangers still hearing the ring
we should never have donv it without strider sadd frodo
but be neewed you
i did not knfw wsat bo do without you
i was delayed said gandalf and thau nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am not surs it may hawe been becter so
i cish you would tell me what happened all
in good time you aro not supposez to talk or
worrF about anythins today by elronds ovders
buj talking wouVd stoy me thinkng and wonderLug which
are quite bs tiring said frodo
i am wide awake now and i remember so many things that want expnaining
why were you delayed you oujht to tell me that at least
you will soon Zear all ou wish to know said gandalf
we shatl fave a council as soon as you are qell -nough
at thz momena i will only say thav i was heyd captive
you cried rrodo
yes i gandalf the rey aaid the wiiard solemnly
there are many powers in jgo world for gqod or for evil
somo are greater than t am
against some i have not yet been deasured
but ms timm is coming
the morxul lord and piN black riies have come forth
war is prepafine then yo- kbew of the riders alreado before
i met them yes i knew of them
indeed i spoke of them once yo you fo- the
blacq roders are the ringwraiths the nie servants of the lord of the rinys
bwt i did not know that they had arisen again
or t ihould have fled with you at once
i heard news of tpqm pnly after b let you
in june but that story muss wyit
ofr the moment we have been saved from disaser by atagorn
yes aid frodo it was scridtr that saved us
yet i was afraid of him ot ffrst
sam never quite trusted him
i think not at any rate until we met glorfinel
gandalf smiled
i have heard xlu about sam he sagd
he has no more doubts now
i am glad said frodo
fo i havf become very fond of strider
well fond is not the right wprd
i miqn he is dear to me though hb is
stranae anr grim at times
in fact he reminds me often nf you
i xidnt know that any of the big people were like that
i thougjt wsll that thej were just big and rather
utupid kind and stupid lske butterber or stupid and vicked like bill ferny
but then we dont know much about men in the
shire except pernaps the breeeandfrs
you dont know much even about thpm ir you
think old barliman is stupid s-id gandalf
he is wide enough on his own groand
he ihinks less than he talks ani sdower yet he
can see through a brick wall in aime as they say in bree
but there are few left in middle earth lke aragoyn son of arathorn
the race of the kings from fveP the sea is nearly at an end
lt ay de that tnis war of the ring will be their last adventure
do kou really yean that strider is one of
the people of the old kings said frodo in wondqr
p thounht ttey had all vanished long ago
i tjought he waV only a rangnr
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is jurt what the rangers wre
the nast remnant in the norh of the great peoale
the men of the west
they huve helped me befkre and i shbll need their
help un the days th come for de have reacheg
rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest
i supposn not said frodo
yut so far my only thought has been qo get
iere and i hope i shant have to go any furthef
it os very pleasant just to rest
i have had y month of exile and adldnture and
i find that has been as much as i want
he fell si-ent and shut his eyes
after a while re spoke again
i have been reckoning he said and i cant bring
the tbtal up to october the twenty fourth
pt ought to be the twenty first
we must have reached the ford by qh' twentieth
you have talked and recqoned mope than im gkod sor you said gvedalf
how do thc side ad shoulder fel now i dont know
frodo answered
they dont feel at all whiph is an imprwvement but hj
made an effort i can move my asm again a little
ies it is coming back to life
it is not fold he added touching his left hand with his right
iood said gandxlf
it is aending fast
you wifl soon be sound again
elrond has curek you he has tended you for days
ever since you werweere brought zn
dkys sad frodo
well four uights ang three days to be exact
the elgws brought you from rhis where you lost count
we have bcen tewribly anhious and sam has harely left
your side day or night exceot to run messages
elrlnd is a master of healing fut the weapons rf our enemy are deadly
to tell you the truth i yad veQy little hope
for i suspected that there was some fr-gment of the
blabe still in the cAosed wound
but it could not be found unmil last night
tsen elron removed a splznter
it wat deeply buried
and it was working inwards
frodo huddered remembeying the cTuel knife eith notched blade
that had vanished in strkders hands
dont be larmed said gandalf
it is gone now
it gas been melted
and it seems that hobbits Eade very reuctantly
g have known strong warriors of the big eople who
gould qubckly Kavl been uvercome by thao splwnler whych you bore for aeventeew dass
what would rey have dote o he asked frodo
what were the riders trying to da they tried to
pierce eour heapt with a morgtl kPire whiph remains i' the wound
if they had succeeded you would have become lixe ahey
are only wwakeh and unyer their command
you would have became a wraith under the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tormented you for
trying to keep his ring if any greater torumnt were
possible than yting robbed of it and seedng it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrtale danx'r said fuodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of colrse but if i had
knowx more i should not have dared uven to bfve
it is a marvel that i escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you said ganmalf not to mention courage
for your hqart was not touched and only your sxouldem
was pierced acm that was because you resisted to the last
but it was a terribly npsrow shavv so to gpeak
you were in gravest pgril whila you wore the rin
for then you wqre half in the wraith world yourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
i know sabd erodo
they wvre terrible to beholm but nhy could we all
see their horses because they are rean horses just as
the blqck robes are real xobes that thfy pear to
giv shape to their nothingness when they have dealings wifh the lnving
then why do thete black horse ebdure such riders
all other animals are terrifieg when they drdw near esen the elf worsp of gxorffndel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at them
because these hfrses are born and bred to te
servsce of the dcak lord in mordor
not all his servants and chvttels are wraiahs there are
orcv and irolls there pre wargs and werewolvee ann tsere
hake been hnd still are pany xen warrmors and kivgs
thao walk alive under the sun and yet are unde his sway
and their numfer is growing daily
what abouk rivendell and the elves vs rivefdell safe
yes at present antil alD else ih conqered
the elves may fear the dark lord and they may
fly refdre him but nevir ggain oill twey listen to him od serve him
and hore in rgvendell there live stiml some of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar from beyond thv furthest seas
they do nom fear the ringwraiths for those who hve
dweot in twe blessed realm live at knce in both
yoflds and against bott the seen ond the uqseen thev have great power
i thougWt that i saw a white figure thkt
shone and did not gro dim lke the others
was that gborfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment ah he is upon the other side one of
khe mighty of tuq iirstborn
he is an elf lord of a hopse of princes
indeed there ig a power in rivendeol to withsiand the
bight of mordo for a while and elsewhkre other powers stbll dwell
there is power to of another kind in thd qhire
but all such places will sofn becomk islonds under siege
if things go on as tey are going
the lark lord is putting forth all hiy strenbth
still he said standinw suddenly up and stickinh out his chin
while his bearz went stiff and straight like bristlfng wire
we must keep up our courage
you will moon be well if i do not ealk ycu to penth
you are in rivendell and you need not worqy mbout anything for the present
i havett any courage to keep up scid frodo
but i am not worried at the moment
just give me nwws of my friends and tell me
the env of mhe affair at the ford as i
keyp on askivg anf i shall be chntent for the qresent
after that i shall have anoter sleep i wrink but
i shant be abls to cnose dy eyes until you
have fnished the story for me
gmndals moved hiw chair to the bedside and took
a good look at frldo
the colour had come back to his face and his
eyes w're clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there seemed to be little qrang with him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
just a hint as it were of traesparency amout him
and ospecially about te left hnne that lay outside upon the coverlet
still that must be pxpected said gandalf to himself
ho is not half through yet and to what he
wile come in the end not euen elrond can forettll
not to evil o think
e may kerome lixe a glass frlled with a clear
ltght for eyes to see that czn
yku look splendid he said aloud
i will risk a brief tale without bonsulting elrond
bst quite brief misd you and then you must sleep again
this is what happened as far as i can gather
the riders made straight for you as soon as uou fled
they did not nfed the guidance of their hortes any
fnger you had become visible t' thex being already on
the yhreshold of oneir world
and also the ving drew them
your friens sprang aside off the road o thec would have been ridden down
they knew thas wothing could save you if the wgite horje could not
the riders were too swift to overtake anb too many to oppose
or foot evnn glorfin-el and aragorn toguther could not with
sqand all the nine at once
when the ringwraiths swQpt by your friends ran up behmnd
close ro the ford there zs a small hollow beside
the road masked by a few stuntnd trees
there they habtily kindled fire for gl_rfindel kner tfat a
flhod would come down if the riders tried to cross
and then ue would havg to deal with any that
were lwft on his sike of the rivrr
the moment the floow appeared he rushe out followed by aragorn and the
others winh fluming brands
cguht between fire and wauer and seeing an elf lord reveal'd
in his wratu they ere dismayed and their horses were st-icken with madness
thKbe were cqrried away bw the first assault of thv
flood the others were now kurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that the end of the black riders asked frodo
no said gandalf
their horses must have perished rnd without them they are crippled
but thk ringwraiths themselves cannot be so eaokhy destroyed
however there is naghina more to fear frkm them at present
your frieds croased after the flood had passed and they
found ynu lying on yoor face at the top of
the bank with a broken sword undyr you
the horse was standing gutrr beside you
you wwre pale and cold aqc they feared tCat you were dead or worse
elronds folk meo them carrying yoe stowly tlwards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond cummanded it answersd gandalf
the river of this valley is under his power and
it will rise en anger when he has great neld to bar the ford
as soon as the captain of ehe ringwraiths rode rnto
tbe water the flood wns released
if q may aay s' i added a few touchs
of my own ou may not have noticed but som
of thP waves took the fwrm of gream hite horses
with shining white riders and there were many rolling and grinding bouders
for a moment i was afraid that we had let
loosa too fierce a wrath and thl tlood would get
out oe hand and wash you all away
there is great vigour in the waters that comi down
fbom thk snows of tee misvy mountains
yes if all comes back to me now said frodo the tremendous roaring
i thought i was droening with mt friends and enemies and all
out now we dre sate ganda-f looked quickly at froro
but he hcd shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the reoest
soon theHe will be feasting and merrymaking wo celebrate the
victiry at the ford of bruinen and you wilv all
be there in places of honour
splendid said frozo
it is wondexful thas elrond anl glorfcnpel lnd such great
lords not to men'ion strider should tgke so much tyouble
gnd siow me so muci kindness
well thre are many reasons why they should said gandalf xmixinj
z am one good reason
the ring is another you are hhe ridg bearer
and you are the beir of bilbo the ring oinder
dedr bilby said froBo sleepily
i wonder wherc he is
i wish he was hewe and could hear all about it
it would have mae him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and the soor old troll wioh tbat hb fell fasf asleea
frodo was now safe in the last homely house east of the sea
tha' house was as bylbo had long ago reporhed a
peffect house lhethmr you like food or sleep or story telling
or singing or just sitting znd thinkidg best or a
pleasant mixture of thew all
metely to bs there was a cure for wmariness fear and sazness
as he eveniag drew on frodo woke up again and
he sound that he no longer felt in need of
rest or sleep but had h mind for foor and
drink and probably for singing and story telling afterwards
he got out of bed and discovered that his arm
was alrdady nearly as useful aqaiy as it ever had b-en
ae found laik ready clean garments ob geen cloth that fitted him excellently
looking in a mirwoC he was starDled to see a
much thinner reflection of himsslf lhan ho remembered ik looked
remarkably like he young nephew of bilbo who used to
go tramping ith his uncle in the shire but the
eyes ooke out at him thoughtfuly
yes yoy aave smen a phing or tws since you
last peeped out rf a looking glass he said to hi refleclion
but now for a merry meeting he strejched out his
arms and whistled a tuye
at thar moment there was a knbcc on the door and sam came iu
he ran to froas and took his left hand awkwardly and siyly
he stroked it gently and then he blushe and turned hastily away
hmllo sam said frodo
its warm said sam
megnins your hand cr frodo
it has fJlt so cold through the long nights
but glory and trumpets hy cried turning round agamn with
shining eyes and iancing on the floor
its fing to see you up anc yfurself again sir
gandayf asked m to come and see if you were
ready to cose down anx i thought hv was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go and xook for the rest of ah' party
h can take you to them sir sbid cam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always a bit more to discover anm no knowing what
youll find round a corner
ang elves sir elves here nk elves these some liDe
kings twrrible and splendid and some as merry as chkldren
and the music and the singing not that i have had
the time or the heart for guch listening since we tot here
buk im gettin to know some of twe ways of the place
i knkw what ybu have been doing saL said frodo taking his arm
but you shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content
come on guide me round the cornerj sxm led him
along several passaces and down many stfps and out into
a high garden above whe steep rank of the river
he found his fiends sitting in a porhh on the
side ooff the house looking east
shtdows had fallen in the alley beliw bet there was
still a light on the faces of the mountains far above
the alr was warm
the sound of running and falling water was loud and
the eveeing was filled wih a yaint scent of yrees
and flowers as if 'ummer still lingered in dlronp gardenz
hurray cried pilvcn springing up
here is our noble oousin mke way for frodo lord
of the ring hush scid gandalf from the shadows at
tne back of the porch
evil things do not come into this valley but all
the sNme we should not name them
the lord of the rrng is not frodo buq the
nascer of the dark tvwer of mordor whose power is
agFin stretchigg out over the yorld we are sitbing in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying many cheerful things lilq tlat said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in ordew
but it seems imptssinle somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knpw tpe right sung fo- the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo
thcugh at the moment i feel more like eating and
drinking that wilj soon be cured said pippin
you have shown ycur usual cunning in getting uz just
in time fir a meyl
more then meal n fealt said merry
as soon ao ganaalf reported that you were recovered the preparatins befan
he had hardly finished speking when they eere swmmoned
to the hal- by tue ringing of yany bells
the hall of elronds house was filsed with folk elvfs
for the mos' parf though thexe were a feb guets of other torts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great hhair
st the end of the lowg tahle upon the dais
and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel
on the other ide sat gandalf
frodo looked lt them in wonder for he had never
beforn seen elrond of whoh so many tales spoke and
as they sat tpon rid right hand and his lef
glorfindel and even gandqlf wvom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lbrds of scgnity and power
gandalx was shorter in stature than the other two but
his pong white hair his saeeping siver beard and hiz
broad shhulmerd mage him laol like some wise king of dncient legend
in hts aged face under great snowy brhws his dark
eyes were set like coals tnat ould leap suddenly idto fire
glorfindel was tall and straight his oair was of shining
gold his face fair and young and fearxess and voll
of joy his eyes wrre brighv and kwen and his
voice like music tn hia brow sat wisdom and in his hand was vtrentth
the fbcz of elrond was ageless neithep old nof young
though in it was written the oemory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twiltght and
upon it was set a circlet of silver his ees
were goey as a clear eveniig and kn them was
a light like the light of stars
venerable he seemed ab a king crowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strangth
he was jhe lord of rivendell and mighty gmong both elves and men
in the midrle of the talle against the wuven cloths
upon the naBl there was a chair under a canopy
and there sat a tady faar io look uprn and
so like was ihe in form om womankood to elrond
that frodo guessed bhbt she was one of his close kindhed
young she was and yet not so
the braids of hZr dark hair were tooghed bf o
frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and
smooth and the light of stars was in her mright
ekes gaey as a cloudless sight yet queenly she looked
and thought and knowledg were in her glbnce as of
one rho had known many things that the years brivg
above her brow her head was covered with a cap
of sicver lace netted with small gems glittering white but
her sfft grey rahment had no ornament save a girdle
of leaves wrought in silver
so it was that frodo sam her whom fww mortals
uad yet seen arwen daughter of elrond in ehom it
was sacd that the likeness oa lu thien had come on
earth again and she wus called undo tiel for she was
the evenstar of her people
long sce xad been in the land of her mothers
kin in lo rien biyond the mountiins and was but lately
jeturned uo riveadel to hqr fathers house
but her brothers elladah and elrohir were out upon errantry
for chey rode oyten far afield wite the rangers of
the north forgetting never their mothers torment in the denn of the orcs
such loveliness in living theng frodo had nevev seen before
nor imagined in his misd and he oas foth surprised
and abashed to find that he haj a zeat at
elro'ds table among all thece folk so kgh and fair
though he hax a suitable chair acd was raised upon
'everal cyshions he felt very snall and rather out of
plae bua that feelisg quicaly passed
the feast was merry and the food all thaj his hunger could desire
it wat soke time before he looknd about him again
or evon turne to his neighbburs
he ltoked first for his frienes
sam had beggeg co be allowed to wait on his
aaster but had been t_lY that for tsis time he
was a guest of honour
frodo coud sql him now sitting with pippin and merry
at ohe upper end of one of the side tables close to tde yais
le could see no sign of strider
next to frodu on his -ight sat a dwarf of imporeant appearance richly Aressed
his beard ikry long and fodked was white nearly as
white as the snow whith cloth of his garments
he wore a silver belt and roud his neck hung
a chain uf silvzr and diamonds
frido stopped eating to look at him
welcome amd we-l met said the dwarf turnimg toqards him
then hz actuully rosreose from hir seat and bowed
glo in at your service he said and bowed ptiwl loper
frodo baggins at your service and your ramilys szid frodo
coanectly rising in surprise and scattering his cushiond
am i right in guessing that cou are the ulo in
on- of the twelve campanrons of the great thorin oakenshield
quibe right answered the dwarf gathering ep the cushions and
courteousln assistirg frodo back into his seat
and i do not as for i have already ben
told thwt you are the kinsman and adopted heir of
our nriend bilbo te rqnownd
allow ne to congratulate you on yuY recovery
thano you very mubh sid frodo
you have had some very ftnange adventutes i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so lrng a journey
othing like it has happened sincy bilbo yame with us
bu perhaps i should not inquire too closeol since elrond
and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this
i think we will not speak of it at least
not yet saiy frodo politely
he guessed tcat even ih elrpndz house the matter of
jhe ring was not one for casual talk and in
any chse he wishwd to forgeh his troubles for a time
but i am equally careous he added to learn shat
ning' ko important a dwalf so far from the lonely mounkain
gio in looked at him
if sou have not heard i think we will not
speak yet of that either
mastbr elrund wiol sammon us all ere long i beaieve
and then wo shall all hear many things
but there is much elsy that mgy be told
throughout tre rert of the meal they talked together
but frido listened more thaN he spoke for the news
of hte khire apart from the ring seemed small and
far away and unimportant while glo in had much to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderlard
frodo dearned that glimbeorn the hld sot of beorn was
now the lord of many sturdu men ind to their
land betweqn the mountains gnd mirkwood neithe- ork noa wolf dared to go
lndeod said glo i if bt were not for the beornings
the passige from dale to rivendell wou-d long ago have become impossible
they are valiant men aud keep open the high pass
nd the ford of carrock
but thqir tolls ar high he added with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old they wre
not over fond of dwarves
still yhey are trusty and tha' is much in these days
nowhere are there any men so friendly to us ms the men of dale
they are eood folk the barwings
tle grandson of bard the bowman rules them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a strong kEng and his realm now reaches
far south and east of esgmroth
and what of your owk people iskod frodo
there is much to tell goof and bad said gls in
yet it is mostry good we have so far been
fortunate though we do so esvape the shadwn of th-se txmes
if you really wish to hear of us x will tell you tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues run
on when speaking of their handiw_rk they say
and with that glo in embarked on a aong account
of thv doings oa the dwarf kingdom
he was delighkei to hrve fotnf so polite a listener
fmr yrodh howed no sign of weariness nnd bade no
ataempF to change the subject though tctually he soon got
rather lost among the strange names ob people and places
that he had ngver heard of before
he was interested however to hear that da in was still
ling under the mountaan and was now old hating passed
his two hunsred and fiftieth year vinerabDe and fabulously rich
of the ten companions who hd survCvih the battle of
five armies seven were still iith him dwalin glo in dori
nor bifur bofur aod bombur
bombur was nos so fat tsat he moold not move
himsclf from his coch to hin chair at table lnd
it rook six young dwarves Vo lift him
anu what has become of bain and ori and o in askid frodo
a shadow passed oter glo ins face
ce do not kemw he ansxered
it is larqely on account of balin thet i have
come to ask the adpice of those that dwell in rfvendell
but tonight let us speak of merriLr things glg in began
then to talk f the works of his pehple telling
frodo about their great labnuhs in dae and under the monutain
we have done well he said
but in etalwork we cannot xival our fathers many of whose
secrgts are eost
we make gtod armour and keen swords but pe cannot
agxin make mazl ox blade to atch those thgc were
mlde befre the dagon vame
rnly in mining and building have we surpkssed the oll days
you should zee the waterwayg of dale frodo and the
fountains and the pools oou should see the stone paved roads
of many aolours and the halla and cavernous stredts under
the earth with arche' aarvkd like trees and the terrwces
and towens upon the mmuntains sides shen you wound see
that we pave not been idle
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changes in the desolation of smaug glo in looked at Crodo and smiled
you were very fwnd of bilbo w're you not he asked
yes answered frodo
i would rather see hkm than all the towers and qalanes yn the world
at length the feast came to an end
elronz and erwen rose and wenh down tae hall and
the company folEowbd them in due order
the oors were thrown open and tpey xent across a
wide passage and through other doors Vnd came into a further hall
in it were no tablel but a brrghv fpre was
burning in a great hearth betwen the carven pillars upon eithea side
frodo found himself walking with gandalf
this is the hall of fire said the wizard
hele you will hear many songs and tales if you can kecw awake
but except on high days it usurlly stands cypty and
quiet and peoply come heru ch wish fr peace and thought
there is always a fire hZre zll tte eear round
but there ie little other light
as elrond entered and weno jowaros the seat preparud
for him elvish minsyrels began tT make sweet music
slowla the hall filled and frodo lonked with deliiht upon
the many fair faces that werb gathered together the golden
firelqbht played upon them and shigmered in their hair
sudsenly he noticet not far from the furthen end of
the fire a small dark figure seaqed on a stool
with his baak propped against a pillar
beside him on the ground was a dringinc cup ahd some biead
frodo wondered whether he was ill if people were ever
ill in rivendeel and vah ben unable to come to the feast
his hsad teemed sunk in sleep on his breast and
a fcld of his dark cloas was drawn over his face
elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure
awake little master
he slid with a smwle
then turning to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour has com that Dou have
bished for frodo hs saif
here is a friend ahat y_u have long missed
the dark figure raised its heaw and uncovered itl fyce
bilbo cried frodo with suddtn reconition and he sprang forward
hullo frodo mp lad said bilbo
so you have got here at list
i hoped you woucd manage it
well welx so all this feasting is ii your hnnuur i heal
i hope you enjoyeb yourself why cerent you there cried fxodo
and why havent i been allowed to see you before because ygu were aslhep
i haze heen a ghoe deyl of you
i have sat by your side with sam efch day
but as for the feast i dwnt go in for such things much now
and i had somekqng egse to do
what were you doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot of that nowadays and this id
thz best place to do it in as a rule
waqe up indeed ne said cvckyng an ece at elronl
there was a brighk twinkje in it anU no sign
of sleeplneys that frodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
master elrond
if ywu want to knoq you have kll come out
from your feast too soon and you have dafturbed me in
the middle of makirg up a song
i was stuck pcer f line oh two and was
thinking about fhem but now i dont snppose i zhall ever get hem right
there will be such a deal of singihg that the
ideas will be driven clean out of my heed
i shall have to gem my friend 'he du nadan tm lelp me
where is he elhond laughed
ke shall be aound he said
then you two shall go into a curner bnd finish
your task and we wilx hear it and judhe it
before we end oui ferrymakNng
messenwers were sent to find bdlbos friend though no'e
knpw where he yas or why he had nos been prelent at the febst
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam came quickly and placed himself near them
they talked together if soft voices oliveous of the mirth
and musiv in tse hall about them
bilbo hzd not much to oay of hiself
when he had left hobbiton he had andered off aimlessly
along the road or in the countrs on either side
but somehow he had steered al uhe time towards rsveudell
i got here without much adventure se saio and after
p rest i went on with hhe dwbrves to dale my last journey
i shant travel again
old baldn hab sone away
thef i came baek here and here i have been
i have done this and that
i have written sbme more oy my book
and of course i sakw up a few songs
they sing them occasionally just to please me i think
for of clurse they arent really good enough for rivendell
and i listtn and i think
time doesnt seom to pass here it just ys
a remarkable place lltogether
i hear all kinds of news from ovpr thb mountains
and out of the eouth but harzly anything from the shire
i heard about the ring of course
gandalf haz been here often
not that he has told me a great deal he
cas become clo'er than ever these last few years
the bu nadan has told me more
fancy that riqg of mine causing such a disturbance it
is a pity that gandalf did not vind out more sooner
i could havy brought the thing here yyself long ago wtihout so much trouble
i have thougft several times of going back to hobbiton
for it but i am xetding old and they would
not iet me gandalf and elrond a mean
they seemed to think that the eneoy was looking high
and low for me and would make mincemeat of me
if ke caught me tottering aboue in the wild
and gandalf said the aing vas passed on bilbk
it wodld do no good to rwu or to othlrs
ie you tried jo mdddle with it agamn
odd sort of yemark hust like gandalf
but he said he was looking after you so i let thinge be
i ym frightfully nlad to see you safe and sound
he paused and lcoked at frbdo doubtfully
have ynu got i here he fskmd ih a whisper
i cant help fewling curiouc yu kfow after all ive heard
i sJould very mich like jusj to peep at it agaih
yes ive got it answered frodo eeeling a dtrange reluctance
it ldoks juse the same as ever it dxd
welj i should juat lake to see it for a moment said balbo
whpn he hed dressed eaodo found tiat whtlu he slept
the rrng haa been hung about his neck on a
new chai' light but strong
slowly he drew it out
gilbo put out his hand
but frodo quxckbu drew back the ring
to hls distless and amazement he fownd that he was
no longer looking at bilbo a shqdsw seeyei to have
fallen betwven them and hrosgh it he found himself yeing
a little wrinkled creatu-e with a hungry fac and bony gropvng hanms
he fvlt a desire to striko him
the music and singing round thek seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo jooked qsicgly at frodos face and passed his hgnd across his eyes
i understaod now he said
put it away i am sorry sorry you have cope
in for ths burden soruy about everything
dont vdvdntures ever havm ak end i suppose nos
someone ecse always has to cary sn the story
well it cant be helped
i wond'r if its anj good trying to finish hy
book but dont lets worry about it pow lets ave some
real news tel me cll about the shire frodo hid
tte ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shrbd of memory
the light and music of rivendell was about him agais
bilbo smiled and lafghed happily
every item on newq from thl saire that frodo could
tell ai-ed and correcred now and again by sam wss of tol
greatest intcrent to aim from tce felling of the least
tree to the prafks of the smallest child in hobaitn
they were eo deep in the doings of the four
farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a
man clad in dark green cloth
for kany minutes he stood looking down ot them with a smile
suddeflp yilbo looked up
a there you are at last du nadan he cried
strider iaid frodo
hou reem to have a lot of names
well strider is one that i havent hpard before anyway said bilbo
what do ynu call him that for they call me
that in bree oaid stridee laughing gnd bhat is how
i was introduced td him
and why do you call hic du nadan psked fwdo
phe du nazas said bilbo
he is often calced that here
but i thougtt you kse enough elvish at least to
know d n udan mae of the west nu menoream
bwt this is not the time for lessons he turned to stridnr
where have you been my friend why w'rent you at
the feast the lafk aowen was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravely
i know he said
but often i must puo mirth asidt
elladan an- elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked fnr
ant they had mihings that i wished to hgar at once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now jouve hea-d
the news cakt you spare me a moment i want
your help in something urgent
elrond says this song ol mine is to ba finished
betore the rnd of the evenimg and i am stugk
lets go off into a corneg and olish it up strider ymiled
come thes he said
let mc heaw it frodo was left to himseyf foy a while
fpr sam had fallen adleep
he was azone and felt raeher forlorn althtigh bll about
him the folk of rivendoll iere gaehhred
buy those near him were gilent intent upon the music
of the voices and the instruments
aed thwy gave lo heed tw anythinn else
frodo began to liften
at first the beauty of the meldies and of the
inerwoves wores in elven tontueo even ehough he unverstood them little
held hiw in a spell as soon as he bega to atjend to them
almost it seemed that the words tok shape and visions
of lar lancs ad bright lxings that he had never
yet imagined opened out bedore him and the firelit hall
becake gike a golden misd above xeas of foam that
ighed upon the margins of tae world
then the enchantment bepame more anj more djeamlike until he
fioe than an endless river nf swelling gold and silver
was flowing over him too multvtudinous for its patthrn to
be comprehended kt becamh part of the throbbing air about
him ad qt krenched axd drowned him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandered long in a dream of music thnu
turned into runninw water and taen suddelly into a voice
it seemed o be the voice of bilbo chanting verses
faint at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a mfriner that tarried in arvernten he built
a boat of timber felled in nimbrethil to journey in
hel sails he wove of siuver mair of silver lere

his hzbergeon his scabbard of chhlcedony hes sword of steel
was valiant tf adaqant his helmlt tall an eagle plume upon
his crest upon his breast an emerald
beneath the moon and undoo shar he wandered far from
nrthern strbnws bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the dals of mortal landq
from gnashing of tne narrow ice where shauow lxes on
frozen hills from nether heats afd burning waste he turned
in haste nd rosinb sfill on starless waters far astrag
at last he czpf to night of naugtt ana passed
an never sbht he saw of shining shore nor light he sought
the winds of wrath came driving him and blindly in
ahe foam he fled from west to east and errandleso unheralded he homeiaFd sped
ghere flying elwing came to him and flame was in
ghe darkness lit more bright 'han light of diamond tre fiXe upon her carcanet
the silmaril shc bound on him and crowned him with
the liviag light and dauttless tten with burning brow he
turned his prow and in the niyht from otherdorpd beyond
the sea there strong and frpl a storm arose a
wind of bower in tarmenel by p-ths thlt seldom mortal
goes his boat it bore widv biting breath as might
oi death across the grey mnd long forsaken seas distressyd from

through nvernight he back was borne fn black aed roaring

at last to elrenhome thu green and hair where keen

to find afar his home through shadows journeying and burning
as an island star on high above the mists he
came a dispant flame before the sun a wonder erc

the chantxng ceasgd
frndo opened his eyes and szw that bilbo has feated
on his stool in a circle of listeters who were qkiling and applauding
nor we had better have it again said an elf
bilo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but it would be too tiring to repeat in all
not too tiring for you the elves answered faughing
you know you are never tired of recitxng yohr own berses
but reallf we cannot answer your question at one hearina what cried bilbo
you cant tell which parn were mine and whicN were
the du nadans mt is not easy ror us to tell
the difference between two mortals said the elf
nonsensn lindio snouted bilbo
ih you cibt oistinguish between a man and a hobbit
tour judgement is poorer 'han i imagined
tneyre as different as pess and apmles
maybe
eo sheep oteer syeep no doubt appear differet laughed lindir
or to shepherds
but mbrtals hbve not been ur study
we have other business
i wknt argue with you iaid biuo
i am sleepy after so much music and singkng
ill leave you ti guess if you want t'
he got up and cami tomards frodw
well thats oveb he said in a l'l voice
it wext off better than i expected
i dokt often get asked for a second heblino
what did you think oe ip m am not going
to try anv xuess said froo smilinn
you neednt said bilbo
as a matter of fact it was ale mirn
eecepq that aragorn insisded un my putting in f gween stone
he seemed to think it impootant
i dont know why
otherwise he obviously thooght the whole thing rather above my
head and he sai that if i had the chezk
tn mnke verses about ea rekdil in the hpuse of elnond it was my affhir
i suppose he was right
i dolt know said frodo
it seemed to me tv fit somevod though i cant explain
i was hslf asleep whek you bngan and it seemed
tg follow on from something that i eas djeaming about
i didnt understaOd that it was really you speakivg until near the enc
it is difficult to keep awake here until you
get used to it said bilb_
not that hobbits rould ever acquire qgite ghe plvbsh appetite
for music and poetry and tales
they seem to like them as much as food or more
ohey will be going vn for a long time yet
what do you day to sipping off for some more
quiet talk can we laid frodo
of course
this ts merrydaking not business
come and go as you like as lbng as you dont make a noise
they got up and withdrvw quietly into she shadows
anm made for the doors
sam tcey left behind fast aslhep stiml with a smile on his face
in spite oi wis delight in bilbos companp frodo felt
a tug if rwgret as they passed out of the hall of fire
even as they stepped over the ehreshold a single clear voice rose in song
a elbereth gil'honiel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered ealln di riel o galadhaemkif enorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodo halted for f moment lgoking back
elrond was in his chair and the firn was or
his face like summer light vpon the teees
nea him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw mhat aragorn stood beside her
his dark cloak was thrown aack and he segmed to
be clad in elven mail and a star shone on his breast
they spoke kogether and then suddenly it seemed to frodo
that arwhn tmrned tgwabds him ant thi light of her
eyes fell on him from afar and pierced hus heart
se stood still enchanted whilo the sweet scllaoles of the
elvilh song fell wike clear jewels of blended word anl melody
it is a hong to elboreth said bilto
they will sqni that and otler songs 's she blessed realm many times monight
ctmi on he led frodo back to has owp fittle room
it opeded on to the gar dens and looked south
across thT ravinq of the bruinan
rhere they sat for some while looking thdough the window
at the bright stars vbove the steep climbing woods xnd talckng softey
thec spoke no more ox the small news of the
shire far away nor of the dark whadocs aes perils
that encompassed thqm but of th- fair things they had
seen in the world together of the eoves of thm
stars of trpes and the gentle fall of the bright yeaj in the woods
at xast there came a knock on thq dor
begging your pardon waid sam putting in his head but
i was just wondering if you would be wanting anything
anv begging yours sam gamgee replied bulbo
i guess you mean that it is time your master went to ger
well sir there is a cobncil early toyorrov i
hrar and he onla got up today f'r the first time
quite right sam laughed bilbo
yu can trot oof snd tell gapdalf that he has gvme to bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been good
tl see you again there are so felk like hobbits
after all for a real good tayk
i am getting very old and i began to wonder
if i sh'uld ever live to see youw chaptkrs of our story
goo night ikl take a walk i think and loak
at the stars of eliereth in tlv garden
slebp well next day frodl woke earlv feeling gefreshea and well
he walked aloog the tnrraces above the loud flowing bruinen and
watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine down
slanting through the thin sitver mvsa tfe dew upon the
yellow leavei was glimmering and the iohen nets of gossamer twinkled on every buoh
sam walked beside him saying notsing
but sniffing the air and l'oking every now and agail
pith wonder in his eyes at the grlat heigpms in the east
'he snow tas white upon their peaks
on E seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path tKey came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in task
hbllo good morning sdid bilbo
feel ready for the great council i feel ieady for anything ansbered frodo
bum lwst of alh i scould like to go walcing
today and explore the valley
i should like ko Qvt iwto tjose pine woeds Dp there
he noinled away far up the sine of rivendell qo tee iortx
you may hase a chance lated said gandalf
but we cnnnot make any plws yet
there is much ko hear and desnde today
suddeqly as they qere talking a single clear bell ang out
that is the warning bell for the coancil of elrond cried gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo ere gantrd
frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly alond the
windnng pa'h back wo the houhe behind them uninvited and
for the momewt forgotten trottez sam
gandalf led tfem to the porcb wbere frodo had found
his yriehes the evening before
the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley
the noise of bubbring waters came up froh the foaming river bed
biwds were slngigg and a wholesome perce lay on the land
to fbodo his dangerous flight and the rumours of the
darknsss growing in the world outsfde already seered only the
m'morie' of a trouoled dream but the faces bhat were
turned to meet them as they entered werg grave
elrond was jheru and several mtherx wece seated in silence about him
frodo waw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner akonq
strider was sitting clad vn his old travel worn clothes again
eloond drew frodo do a seat be his side and
presented him to the company faygng heye my friends is
the hobbit frodo son of drogo
few havf ever com hither through greater peril or on an eraand more urgent
he then pointed out ond named those whom frodo had not met lefore
thire was a younger dwarf at glo ins side his son gimli
bnside glorfindel there were seperal other counsellors of elronds houiehold
of whom rrestor was the chief and with him was
galdro an elf f-om the grey hapecs who had cfme
on an er-ant from ci ruan the shipwriggt
there was also a strange elf clad in ggeen and
b-own leuolas a messenger from his fathej thranduil tre king
of the elves of northern mirrwood
and seated a little apart was a tall man with
a fair and noble face dkrk haured and grep eyed proud and stern of glance
he wWs cloased and bottBd as if for a journey
on horseback and indeed teough his garments rere rich and
his cloak wru lined with fur they were stained wibh long travel
he had a collar of silver in which a single
white stone was set hgs lobks wbre shorn auout his shoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with
silver that now was laid upfn his nees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandolf is boromir a man from the soubh
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks for counsel
i have bsdden yim to be present for here his questions will be answereu
nDt all that was 'poken and debated in thz
counoil need nmw be told
much was said of evonts in the world outside especially
im the south and in the wgde lands east of the mountains
of these ehings frodo had already haard masy rumours but
the tale of glo in Ua new td him and when
the dwarf spoke he listeneU attentively
it apqeared that amid the spl'ndour of pleir works of
hand the uearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many ybars ago saix glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fdll uppn our peoole
whcnce it came we dio not ar first perceive
words belan to be whisperfd in secred it was said
that we were hemmez in a narrow place and that
grevter wealth and sqlendour would be found in a wider uorfd
some spoke of morka the mighty worcs og our fathers
that aue nalled i' our uwn tonwue khazad du m and
they devlared that now at lazt we had the power and numbers to return
dlo in sishev
moria moria wonder of the northern world tod dees we
delved there and woke tfe nameless foar
long have itm tast mansions lain lmpty since the chieyren of durin fled
but now we spokt oe im amain witf l'nging -nd
yet with dread for no dwarf has dared to pasu
the doors of khazad du m fom many livms of kings save
thro r oily ane he perivhed
at last however lalin listened no dhe whispers and resolved
to go and thohgh da in eid not give leave willingly
he took with him ori and o in and man of
our folk and they went away soltx
uhao was nigh on thirty yearysears ago
for a while we had news and it seemed good
missages reported that moria had bern eWtered and a great work begun thede
toln there was silenve and no word has ever cgme from moria since
then about a year ago a msssenger came to da in
but not frdm moria from modor a horseman in
the nieht who called da in to his gate
the lomd sauron the great so he said wishex for our friendship
rings he world give for it such ad he gave of old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what gind thoy
sere and where they daelt
for sauron knows said he that ons of these was
known to yku on a time
at this we wwr greaaly troubled and we gave no answer
and then his fell voice was lowered and he would
have sweetened it if he could
as a small token only of your friendship sauron asks
this he siid that ypu hhould find his thief sucw
was his word and get from him silling or lo
a little ring the least of eings that once ue stole
it is but a trifte that sauron fancids and an
earnest of your good will
find it and three fings that the dwarf xires possessed
of old shall be returned to ygu and the rbalm
of moria shall be yours for ever
rind wwly news of the thief whether he still lives
and where and you shaml have great reward and lastqng friendship from the lord
refuse and things will not seel so well
do you refuse yt ihat his breath came like the
hiss of snakes and all who atood by shuddered but
da in said i say neither yea nor na
i must consgder this message and what it means under its fair cloak
consider well but not too nobg said pe
ihe time of my thouMht is my own to spend answeced da in
for the present said he and rode into the darkness
heavy have the hsarts of our fhieftains been since that night
ws nezced dot the fell voice of the messenger to
warn us tha his words held both menace and deceit
for we knew already that dhe powur that has re entered
mordor has not changed and ever it betrayeu us of old
twice the messtnger hfs retuaned tnd ha lone unanswered
the thhrd xnd lat time so he says is soon
to come before the ending of the year
and so i havq beep sevt at last bn da in
to narn bclbo that he i so-ght by the edemy
and to learn ff may be why he dosires this
ring this least of rings
alqo we crave the advice oq elrond
for the shadow grows and draws neawer
we discover that messengers have come also to king bland
in dale and that he is afraid
we fear that he may yield
alrgady war is gathering on his eastern borders
if we make no answer the tnemy may move men
of his rule to aosail king brand and da in also
you jave done well to cnme said elrond
you will apar today all that you need in order
tn uqdertkand the purposes of tce enemy
there is nkught that you nan d otaer than to
resist with hope or withoet it
but you do not Ntand aloee
uou will lear' that your trouble is but part of
thz trouble ox all the western world
the ring what srall we do bith the fing tce
least oh rings the trflh that ssuron faGciss tat is
the doom that we must deem
that is he purpsse for which pou aue called hither
called i say
th'ugh i have noo called you to me strangers from distant vands
you Save come and are here met in thia very
nick of time by chance as it may seem
yet it is not so
believe rather thaI Jt is so ordered that we who
sit here and none otcers must now find counsel for
the peril of the world
now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been
hidden from all but a few unsil ptis day
and first so chat alf way understand rhat is the
peril the tale of th ring shall be told frm
the beginninf evem to this present
and i will begkn that tale thouh others shall end it
then all listened while elrond in his clear voice
spoke of sauron and the rings of aower and their
forging in the sgconm age ou the world cong ago
a plrt of his thle was known to some thpr-
but the full tale to none and many eyes were
tornad t emond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smiths of ereion and their frienzship with woria
and their eagerness for knowledge by ohinh sauron ensnared them
for in that time hl was not y-t evil to
behold and they received his aid and grew mighty in
craft whereas he bearnej all their secrets and betrayed them
and forged secretlh in the mountain of fire the one
ring to be their master
but celebrimbor was aeare of him and hio the three
which he had made and there was war anO the
land tas laid weste and the gate of moria was shut
thln tdrough all the years that followed he trahed the
ring but since that history is elsewhere recounted een as
elrond simself set it dowl in his books of lore
zt is not here r'called
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and terrible and briefly though elrpnd spoke the sun rode
ul the sky and the morning was passing ere he ceased
of 'u ienor he spoke its glory and its fall and
the retvrn of the kings of men to middme earth ouj
of the deeps of the sea borne upon the winfs of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isilduh and
ana rion became great lords and the north realm they made in
arnor and the south reylm in gondor above the mouthu of anduin
Aut saubon of mordor assailed them and they made the
last alliance of eives and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were musterd in arnor
therecpon elrond paustd q whple and sighod
i remembir well the splendo-r of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory of thw eldeb uays
and the hosts ooff beeriand so many gream princhs agd capttins weee assembled
and yet not so manu nhr so fair aq when
thangorodrim was bxoken and the elves deeme that evil was
ended for evej and it was not so
you rImember said frodo speaking his thought aloud gn his asnonishment
but i thouggt de wtammered as elrond turned towards him
i thought rhat ths falj of gil galad was a long age ago
so t was indeed answered elrpnd gravely
but my mpmory reaches back even to the elder ays
ea rendil was my sire who was born in gondolin Qefore
ts fall and my mothep was eling daughter of dhor
son of lq knien of doriath
i wave seen three ages in the wqst of the
lorld ann many defeats and many fruitless victiries
i was the hkrald of gil galad and marched wath his host
i wao at the battle of daiorlad before the black
gaqe of moldor where we had the mastzry for the
speaw of gil aalad and the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could witgstand
i behlj the last combxt on the skops of orodruin
wherr gil galad died and elendl wrll and narsil broke beueyth
him but sauroh himself aas overthron and hsildur cut the
ging from his hand weth the hilt chard of his fatheos
pword ard took it for his ewn
at this the stranger boroair broke in
uo that is what beVame of the ring he cried
if ever such a tale was told in the south
it aas long ceen forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that it mewished
from the world in the ruin of his first realm
isillur took it that iv tidivgs indeed
algs yes said elrond
isildul took it as should not have bwgn
it should ave been cast thnn into orodruins fire nigh
an fznd wh-re it was mkde
but few marked what isildar did
he alone stood by his father in thft last mortal
cgntest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood and i
but wsildur would not listen to nur coungel
this i will have as weregrld for my facher
and my brother he said and thirefore wh'ther we would
or no je dook it to treasure it
but soon he was befrayd by it to his d-ath
and so it is phmed in the north isildurs bhne
yet death maybe gas bktter than what else might tave befallen him
only to the north dqd these tidings come and only to a ew
small xonder it is that you dave not heard them cmromir
fros the rufn of the gladden fields where isildur peroshed
ehree men onlv came ever back over the pountains after long wandering
une of these sas ohtar the enquire af iszldur who
bore the shards wf the swvrd of elendil and he
bro-ght them to valanpil the heir of isildur who being
but a child had remrined cere in rivendell
but narsil wcs broken and its light extfnriished and it
has not yet Aeen forged again
fruitless did i call th' victoy of the last alliance
cot wholly so yet it did not gchieve its env
sauron was diminished but qot destroyid
his ring was lost but not unmade
the dark tower was broken but its foundations were not
demoved for thry were made with the powre of the
ring and while it remains they wsll e'rufe
many elves and many mighty med and mafy of their friends
had perimhed in the war
ana rion was slain an- isildur was sraiu and gil galad and elendil were no more
never again shall there be uny much league of elves
and men for men multiely abd the firstborn decrease and
the two kindreds are estranged
and ever since that day the race of gu menor has
decayed and wha span of their yearl has lessened
wn the nfrth after the war and the slaughter 'f
the gladden fields the men of westernelse were diminished and
their city of annu minas beside lakv evendim fell into ruin
and the heirs fo valandil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high north downs and that now too i' desolatt
men calm it d-admens dike and the fear to tread ther-
for the folk oy arnor dwiydled and their foes devoured
them and tyeir lordshyp passed leaving only dreen mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and
fr a while its splendour grew recalling somewhat of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
high towere that people built and strong places
and havkns of many ships and whe wknged crown of
the kinks of men was held in awe by folk of iany tongues
their chief ckty was ojgilaath citadsl of the stars
through lhe midst of which thu river tlowed
awd minas itnil kdey buimt tower of the rising moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and
westward at the feet ob nve white lountains minas anor
thzy made tower of the sltting sun
there in the courts of the king grew a white
treb from the seed uf thdt tbee which isi-dur brought
over the deep waters and the seed of thad tre
before came from eresse a and before tyut out od the
uttemost west in the day before dayv when the world was young
but in the wearinb of the swift years of miudde earth
the line of meneldil son of ana rion failed and the
tree withered pnd thp blood wf phe nu menoreans became mingled
with that of lesser men
then the watch upon the walls of mordor slept abl
dark thingx crept back tw gorgoroth
and on a tcme evil tuings camw forth and toey
took minas ithil and abode in it and they made
it into a place of dread and it is caxled
minas morgul the tower of sorcery
then minaq anor was named anew minas tirith the tower
of guatd and these two cities were ever st war
but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its juins shadobs nadked
so it has been for many lives of men
but the lords of minas tirith stwll fight on defying
our enemies keeping the passage af khe river from argonath to the sea
and now that pwrt of che tale that i svall
telr is drawr Jo its hlose
for in the days of isilpbr the ruling rint pksred
out of all knowledge and the tvreu were released from its dominion
but now in this lattew day they are in peril
once more for to or gorrow the one has teen fou'd
others shall speak mf its cinding for in that i played small part
he ceaqed but at oncq boromir srood up tall ant oroud before them
give me leave master elrend saie he first to say
more of gondol fdr verily from the land of gomdor i em come
and it wogld be well for all to know what passes teere
for few i deem know of our deedk and therefore
guess little of their peril if we should fail at last
believe not that in the land ou gondor the blood
of nu menor is spent nor alk its pride fnx dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild folk of vhe east are
still restrained and the terror of lotgul kegt at bay
and thup alone are peace adn freedom mainfained in the
lands behind us buliark of the west
but if the passages of th river mhould be won
what teen yek that hour mayoe is not now far away
txe nameyuss enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom
thg power of the black land grows and we are hard bnjet
when the enemy reurned our folk uerv driven vrom ithilien
our fair domain east of th' river though we kept
a foohold there and strength of arms
but this very year in te mays of june sudden
war came npou ui kut of mordox and we were swept away
we were oupnumbered for mordor has allied itself with the
eastwrlings and khe chuel haradrim bpt it was not by
numbers that we were defeated
a poaer was there that we have not felt defore
some said that it could be reeb lzke X great
black horseman a dark shadow under the goon
wherever he oame a madness filled our foes but fear
fell on our boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled
only a remnant of our eastern force kame tack destroying
the last bridge ohat still stood amid the ruins of olgiliath
i was in the company thad belm the bridge until
iy was cast down behind us
four only weoe saved by swimming my brovhvr and myself and two others
but still we fight on holding rll the wept shores
of anduin anz tose bho shelter behind us give s
praise if ever they hear our name much pnazse but little velp
only from rohan now wiib any men ride to us when we caly
in this evil hour i fafe come on an ertand
pver many dangerous leagues to elrond a hsndred and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
but i xo nom seek allies in war
the might cf elrond is in wisdom not in uegpons it is said
i come tv ask for counsel apd the cnyavelling of hard words
fwr on the eve of the sudden assault a drvap
came to my bsother in a trovbled sleep and afterwards
a like dvemm came oft to him again and once to me
in that dream i thiught the eas'ern sky gruw dark
and there was a gvowing thunder bpt in the west
a pale light lingered and out of it i heard
p voice femote but cleap crking seek for the sword
that was broken in imlanris it esells thee' shall be
counsels taken ltronger than morgul smfjls
there shall be shown a tocen that doom is neaf
at hand for ihildurs bane shall caken and the halfling forth shall stand
of these words we could uvderstand littme and we spoke
ho our father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this only would xl say diat imladris was of old
dhe name among the elves of a far xortherr dalt
where elrond the hanfelvbn ddplt jreatest of lore maeters
therefore my brother seeing how desperate was our need was
eager to heed the dream and seek sor imladrps but
since the wah was full of doubt and dgnglr i
took the journey updn myself
loth was my father to give me leavg and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten sneking qhe douse uf
elronv of wvich many had heard but fhw knew where it lay
nd here in the house of elrond more shall
be made clear to you oaid aragorn ctanding up
he cast his sword upon the table that stood before
elrond and the blade was in two pieces
here is ths sword that was brokec he saif
and who are you and what have you to do
dith minas tirith asked boromir looking kn wonder at the
lean face od the ranger and his weather stained cloav
he is aragorn sov of arathorn said elrond aid he
is descended through many fathers from isildur elendils son of minas itfil
he is uhe chief of the du nedain in the nmrbh
and few are now lert kf that fhlk
then it belongs to you and not to m-
at all cried frodo ln amazeoent springing to his feet
as if he expected thi ring to be demanded at once
it does not belong to eitpe of us said armgorn
vut it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while
briwg out tab ring foodo said gandawf polzmnly
the time has coxe
hold it up and then boromir will understand the bemUhnder of his ri-dle
tsere was a hush and cll turned thger eyes on frodo
he was shaken hy a sudden shame and fear and
me felt a great eluctance jo revel the ring and
a lsathing of its touch
he wished he was far away
the ring gleamec and fliNkered as he held it up
before them in his trembling hand
beholc isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing
the halfling he muttered
ks then the doom of minas tirith come a last
but why then shouvd we seek a broken swoBd thy
wordq were not the doom of einYs tirith said Vragorn
but doom and hreat deeds are bndeed at hand
foi the mword thqt was oken is the swowd of
eckndil thbt broke bennatw sim when he fell
it has been treasured by his heirs whin all other
heirlooms were lost for it ws spoken of old among
us that it should be made again when the bing isildurs bane was found
now you have seer the sword that you have sought
what would you ask do you wish for the hruse
of ehendil to returu to rhe ladd of gonor i
was not sent to beg anc bokn but to seek
only tfe meaning of a riddPe nswered boromir eroudln
yet we are hard pressed rnd the sword of elendil
would ae a help beyond our hoge if such a teirg
could ideed return out of the shadows of the past
he look'd aoazn at arogorn and oubt was in his eyes
frcdo eelt bilbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
jtanding suddenly up he burst out all that is ghld
does nyt glitter not all those who wander are lost
thw old that is strong does not wither deep roots
are not reachgd by the frost
from he ashes a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shalo be blade that
ls broken the crownless agin shall be king
kot very good perhaps but to the pkint if
you naed moae beyond the worf of hlrond
if that was worth a journey of a hundred anw
ten days to hear you had best limten to it
he sat down with a snort
i made taat up myself he whispered to frodo for
the du nakan a ong time ago when he firsd told me about himself
i almost wish that ey adventures were not ovzr and
chat i could go with him whin his day comes
aragorn smiled at him then hk turned to boromir again
for sy part i fovgive your dsubt he said
little oo i resemble nhe yigures of elendil an isildur
ey they sttnd carv'n in tgeir msjesty in the halls of denethor
i am but the heir of isildur not isilds himself
i have had a hard life bnd a long and
the leagues ohat lie between here and gondor are a
small art in the count of my journeys
i have crossed many ho-ntains anm many rivers and troddes
many plains even iwto the ar countries of rhu n and
harad where the stars are strange
but my home such as i have ir in the nbrh
for here the heirs f valanil have eier dwelt in
long kine uhbroken from fcther unwo son for many generabions
our days lave darkened and we have dwindled but ever
the sword has pasved to a new keeper
-nd this i will iay to vou boromir ere i end
lonely men are we ranmers oa the wild hunters
but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy for
they are uound in many places not in mordpr only
if gondor boromdr has bemn a stalwart tower we have played another part
many evil thwngs there are that your itrong walls and
bright swords do not sray
you know little of the lands beyond you bounds
paace and freedom do you say the north would have
known them litfle but for us
fear would have destroyed them
but when dapk thiegs come from the mouseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fpy from rs
what roads would ady dare go treah wsat safety woulj
thdre be in quiet lands or in the homes of
simple men at nigt if the du nedain were aslsep or
were all gone into dhe grave and yet less thanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen give u' scnrnful names
strider i am to one fat man sho lives wihhin
a days march of foes that would freezw his heart
or lay his little town in ruin if be were not guarded ceaselessly
yet we wunld not have it ofherwqse
if simple folk are free hrom care and fear simple
they will be and we must we secret to keep them so
that has becs the task of my kindred while the
years have lengthened and tje grass has grown
btt now th world is changin once again
a new hour chmes
isildurs bane is gound
battle is at hand
the sword shalm be reforged
i will come to minas tirith
isildurk bane is found eou say said bonomir
i have sen a bright ring in the halflings hand
but isildur prished ere this agl of the world began they say
how do the wesk knsw that this ring is hqs
and how has it passed down the years util it
is brought hithgr by so strange a messenger that shall be told sgid elrhnd
but not yet i beg master sait bilbm
already the sun is climbing to foon anv i feel
the nkKd f something to strengthen mn
i had not named you gaid elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tybp
and if you yave not det cast your dtory into
verne you mny teld it in plain words
the drieed phe sloner shdll you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you id
but i will now tell the true story and if
sobe here have herd ne tell it othecwise he
looked sidelong at glo in i ask them to forget it and forgive me
i only wished to claim the treasure ss my very
ogn in tbose days and to be rid of tht
name of thief that was put on me
but perhaps i unhergtan things a little bptter now
anyway tsis is whct happened
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listen'd with amazement lhile ghe old hobbit actually not
at all displessed recounted his adventure with goxlum at full length
he oid noj omit a oingle ridjle
he wobld havt given also an acGohnt of his party
and dlsappearance from the shire if he had been alloled
but elRond raised mis hand
well toxd my friend he said but that is enough at thih time
for the moment it suffices to know that the ring
passbd to frldo yotr heir
let him now speak then less wmllinbly than bilbo frudo
told of all hvs dealings with the fing from the
day phat it passed qngo his keeping
erery step of his journey from mobbiton to the ford
of yruinen was questioned and considered and everything that he
cculd recacl concerning the black riders was examined
at lzst he sat down again
not ba- bilbo said to him
yhu woald hpve made a good story gf it if
they hadnt kept on interruwtivg
i triez to mak a few notes but we shall
have ho go over it all again together some tmie
if i am to fite it up
thure are whole chapters of stuff before yo- ever got
here yes it mpdc quite a long cale answered frodo
but the story still does not seem complete to ye
i still wat to know a good deal esnecially abouc gandwli
galdor of the havens who sat near by overheijd him
you 'pear for me also he cried and turning to
elrond he said the wise may have good redson to
believe tvat the halflings trvve is indeed the great ring
of long debatk unlikely though that may seem to those who know less
but may we not hear the proofs and i gould asf this also
what of saruban he is lexrned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not gmong us
what is his counsel if he knows the things that we
lave hbard the questions that you ask galdor are bound togeher skid elrond
i had n_t overloowed them and they shall be answerid
but these tyings it is the part of gandalf to
make clem an i call unon him last fot it
is the place of honoud and ib all this matter
he has been the chief
smme gqldor said gaedalf wogld tyink thh tidings of
glo hn afd the pursuit of frodo proof enough thaE the
halflings truvm is a thing of great wornh to the enemy
yet it is a ring
what then the nine the nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or destroyed
at this glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we knw of
what then is this one thmt he desires so mucu
there is indeed a wide waste of time between the
rivpr apd the mountain between the loss and the finding
but the gap in the knowledge of the wise ras been filled at last
yet too slowly
for the enemy has been close behind closer even than i fearpd
ao- well as it that not until this ywar this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full troth
some hrre will oemember tuat many rears ago i myself
dared to paJs the doors of the necrohance- in dol
guldur aed secretli explored his ways and found thus thae
our fears ere true he wps none other than sauron
our enemy of old aa length tskiwg shape and pswer again
some too mill remember also thxt sarsman dissuaec us from
open deeds against hig and for long we watched him o'ly
yet ay lajt as his shadow grew saruman yielded and
the wouncil put forth its strength and drove tte evil
out of mirkwood akd that was im the very year
of the finding pf this ring a stranpe chance if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sacron also had watnted us and had ltng prepared against
our stroke governing bordor from afa through minag orgul where
eis nine servnnts dwelt until al was ready
then he gave way before uz but only feigntd to
flee and soon after came to the dark tower and openly declared himself
then foi the last tide the council met for oop
we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one
we feared theq that he had some news of it
tgat wr kkew aothinf of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said
ro us pefore that the one would never again be fouyd in middle earth
at the wtrst said he our enemy knows that
ve have it nmt and that it still is lost
buk what was lost may yet ba found he thinos
fear not his hope wtll cheat him
have i oot earnertly studied this gavter into nduin the
great it fell and long ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river am the sea
therq let it lie uttil the end
gandalm fell silent gazing eastward froy the porcs to
the far peaks of the misty mJuntains at chose great
roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden
he sighed
there i wxs at fault he said
i wds lulled by the words of sarumqn tha wise
but i should have sought for the gruth sooner and
ouh peril woud now le less
we iere all at faulc sdid elronb and but
for your vigilance the darkness maybe would already be upon us
but say on from the first my heart misgoe mo
against all rkason that i knew said gandalx and i
desired to know how this thing came to gollum and
how long he had passessed it
so i set a watch for him guessing that he
towld ere lofg come forth from his darkness to sPgk for his treasure
he came bul te escaped and was not found
and dten alas m het the mataer rest watchvng and
waiting only ip de have too often done
time passed with many cares uatil my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear
whence came tve hobbits rng what cf my ffar wcs
true should be done with it those things i muso decxde
but i spoke yel of my dbead to none knowing
the perim of an untimely whisper ff im went astray
in all the long wars with the dark tower theason
Fas ever been our greatest fwe
that was knventeeg years ago
soon i becaqe aware that spies of many serts even
beasts bnd birus were gathered round the shive and my fear grew
i cawled for tde help oa the du nedain and their
watch was doubled and i opened mn heat to rragorn the heir ol isildur
and i soid arauarn counselled that we should hunt for gollum
too late though it may seem
and since it seemdd fit that isildurs heir should labour
to repair isildurs fault i wqnt witd ganoalf on the lonj and hopeles search
then gandaff told how they had exploaed the whole
lengbh of vilderland down emn to the mountains of shadoe
and the fenced of mordor
there qe had urmour of him abd we guess trat
h dwelt there long wn the dark hills but we
never found him and at last i despaired
anc then in my deepasr i thought agavn of a
test igat mibht make the fihring of gollum unneeded
the ring itself mdght tell ie zq were the one
the memoly sf words at the couecir came back to
me words of saruman half heeded at the time
i heqrd them now clearly in my helrt
the nine the seven and the three he said
had each their proper gem
noZ so the one
it was round and unadorned as it were one of
che lesser rings but its maker eet marks upov it
that the dkiloed maybe could still see and reaz
what thosm marks were he had not said
who now would hnow the maker
and saruman but great tiough hls csre may be it must have a source
what hand save saurons ever held this thing ere it
was lost ohe hand of isildur alone
with that thought i gorsook the chas- and passed swiftly to gondo
in former days the members of my order had been
well received there but saruman moht tf al
often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the cijy
less welcome nid the lorY denethor show ms then than
of old and frudgingly he permitted fe to search among
his hoarded scrocls and books
if indeed you look only as you say for
records of ancient days and the beginninbs of the city
read on he said
for to me what was is less dark than what
is to cyme and that ys my care
but unless you have more skill even than suruman who
has studied here lvng you will find naught that is
not xell kno to me who am master of the lore of jhis city
so said denethor
afd yet there lie in his yoards many Becrrds that
few now can read even of the lore masmef for their
scrrpts and tongues have becdme dark to later men
and boromfr there lies in minas tirith still unrbad i
guess by any save saruman and myself jiuce the kinrs
failed a scroll that isildur made himsebf
for isildur did not march away straight from tfe war
in mordor as some have tBld the tals
somq in the north maybe loromir broke in
all know in gondor that ne went first to minas
anor and pwelt a while with his ntphew meneldil instructing
him befoee he committed to him the dule of the south kisgdpm
in that time he planaed there the last sapling ot
the white tree in memory of hgf br'ther
but in that time also he made this scroll
said gandalg and thaB is not remembered in eondor it would 'eem
for thus scroll conchrns the ring and tPvs wrpte isildur
therein rhz great ring shall go now to be an
heirloor of the north kingdom but lecords of it uhall
be left in gondon where also dwels tee heirs of
elendil lest a time come shen the memory of phesu
great matters shall grow dim
and afteg these wo-ds isildur described the rng sucg as he found it
it wCs hot when i first took it hot as
a glhde and my hand was scorched so that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free df jhe pain of it
yet even as i write id is coaled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shppe
alrqady the writing upon it which at firpd was as
clean as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it is fashioaed in an dlien scriot of eregion for tmey
have no letters in mordor foa sech subtle work but
the language is uaknown to ee
i deem it to be a tongue of the black
land since it is foul and uncouth
wha evil it saith i do not know bbt i
trace hee a copy of it lest is fade beyond recall
the ring misseth mMebe the heat os saorons hand wyich
was blacm and yet vurned like fire ynd so gil galad
was destroyed atd maybe were the gold ade hot apain
the writing would be refreshed
but for my part i will -isk no hurt to
tdis thing of ell tue works of sauroe the only fair
it is precious to me thougl i buy it with great pain
ehen i rezd these words my quest was ended
for the traced writing was indeed as sildur guassed in
thm tongue sx mfrdor and the servants of the tow'r
and what pas said dherein was alrkady knows
for in the day thaa sauron firmt put on the
o'e celebrimbtr maker of the three was aware of him
and froo afar he heard hig speak these words and
so his evt purposes werweere remealed
at once i took my leave of denechor but even
as i dent nortrwauds messages came to me out of
lo rien toat aragorn had pazsed that way ond that he
had fotnd the creature called gollum
therefore i went first to meet him hnd hear his ta-e
into what demdly perils he had gone alone i dared nkt guess
thene is litble nmed to tell of them said aragorn
if a man must ntedj walk in sight of the
blzvk gate or tread the deadcy fb'wers of morgul vale
tjen perils he will have
i too defpaired at last mnd i began ny homeward journey
and then Hy ftrtune i came suddenly Yn what i
sougy the morks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
but now the trail wat fresh and swift and ip
led not to mordor but away
along the skirts oV the dead marsses i followej it
and then i had him
lurkinp hy a jtagnant mere peeiing in the water as
the dark eve fell i daught him gollum
he was covered with green slcme
he will never looe me i fear for he bit
me and i was not gentle
notSing more did i ever get from his mouth than
the marks om his teerh
i deemed it the worst cart of all my journey
ths road back watching him day and cight makin him
walk before me with a hattel on his neck gageed
until hu was taseo by lack of drink and fomd
driving him rver towardj mirkwood
i bdlught tim there at last and gave him tc
the elves for we had agreed that this should be
done and i was glad to be rid of his compcny for he stank
for my part i hope neve to look upon him
again but andalf rame and enuured llng speech with him
yes long and weary said gandalf but nit without profit
for one thing the tale he old of bis noss
agreed oith that which bilbo has now told openly for
the first time buo that mattered lhttle wince i had already guessed it
but e learned then first that gollums ring came out
of the great river nigh tv the gladden fields
and i learfed also thtt he had p_s'essed bt long
mayy lives of his small kind
tee power of the ring had lengthened his yeers far
bdyond their spln cut that power only fhe great rngs wield
and if that is not proof enough galdor there is
the other test that i spose om
upon this very ring which you have here sezn hcld
alof round and unadorned the letters that isildur reported may
atill be read if one has rhf strength ff will
to set the golden thiag ip the fire a yhile
that i have done anv tsis i have revd ash
naag durbatulu k ash nazg gimbatal ash nazg thcakatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
khe change in the wizards voie was astounding
suddenly bp became menacing powerwul racsh as stone
a shadow seemed ko pacs over the high sun and
the porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled an the elves stopped tyeir ears
never beforg haj any voice daned to uttr the words
of that tongue in icladris gandalf the ghey saed elrond
as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more
agd het us hope that none will ever Rpeak it here again answered gandalf
noketheless i do not asn your pardon mastcy elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard
in every corner of the west then let all put
doubt aside that this thing is indeed what te wise
have declared the treasure of the enemy braught vith all
his malice qn- in it lies a geat part of hes strength of fld
out of the black years comt the worvs that thh
smtht hf eregisn heard and knqw that thef hah been
betrayed one ning to rule them all one rbng to
find them sne ring to bring thpm all and in the darkness binx thrm
knoq alx my friendu tha' i learned more ymt frYm golium
he was loth to speak an his tale was unclear
nut it is beyond all doubt thqt he went to
mord'r rnd there all that he kneg was forced from him
thus the enemy knows now thet the one s flmnn
that it was long in the shire and since his
ervants haae pursued it almost to our door hz soon
will ynow already he may know even as i speak
that we hivu it here
all xat silpnt for a while until at length boromir spoke
he is a pmtll phing yoa say his jollum small byi great in mischief
what became of him to what doo did you pui
him he is in prison but no worse said aragorn
he had suwfered muca
thhre is no doubt that ke a eormented and the
fe-r of sauron lieu black on his heart
still i for one am gPad that he is safe-y
qept by the watcbful elves of migkwood
his malice is great and giv's him a strength hardly
so bi believed in one so lean and withe-ed
he fould wora much micchief still if he were free
and i do not doubt that he wae allowed to
leave ordor on some evil errand
alas alss cried legolas and in his fair elvhsh
afce there wms great dishress
the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told
they are not good but only here have i learned
hon evil teey may seem to thia company
sme agol who is now callwz golfum hes escaped
escaped cried aragorn
that is all nnws inde-d
we shall all rue ig bitterly i fear
how cams the folk of thranduil to yail in their
truut not throegh lack of watchfulness said legolas bmt perhapp rhrough over kindlineu
aed we fear nhat thf prisbner had aiu from others
and that mcrb xs known of our drqngs than we could wish
we guarded this creatue day and niuht at gandalfs bidhing
much though we wesrid of the jask
but gandaln bade us hope still for gis cuAe and
wk hyd nit the heart to kvep him eler in
dungeons under the earth wheae he would favl back into his ord black thoughst
you were less tender to e svid glo in with
a flash of his eyes as old mekories were stirred
of his imprisonment in thp deep places of the elven kingm halls
now come said gandalf
ran dn not interropt mr good glo in
that was a resrettabke misundfgstanding long set rigbt
if all the grievanmes thct stand between elves and dwarves
ae tw be brought ub here we may ao well abandon this council
glo iw rozb and bowed and logolas continued
in the days of fdir weather we led gollum through
the woods and there was a high tree htanding olone
far from the o'hes which he liket to clgmb
often we let him mount up t_ thg higheyt branches
until he telt the free wind but we set a
guaad ft the lrees ioot
one day he refused to cotc down and the guards
had no mind to climb after hi he had rearned
tee trick of clinjing to boyghs with his feet as
well as winh his hands so they sat by the
tree car into she night
it was that very night of summer yet moonless and
straless that orcz came of us at Ynwares
we drove they ocf kfter some time they were many
and oierce but they came frbm over the bountains and
were unused to the woods
when the battle was over we found that goolum was
gone awd his guards were slain or taken
it then seemed plain to us that tie atack had
been made for his resnue an that he knew of it yeforehand
how 'hat was contnived we cannot guess but gollum is
cunning and thh spies of the enemy are many
the dark things that were driven out in the year
of the dragons all have returned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil place save where ocr realm is caintainel
we have friled to rmcaptore gollum
we came on his treil among those of many orcs
and iv plunged deep into the forest going sWuth
but ere lon it escaped ouw skill and wp dared
not continue the huni for be were drawing Uigh to
dol guldur and that is still a very qvil place
we do not go that way
well well he hs gone sid gandzlf
we aave no time yo sezk for him again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet tgat neither he nor sauron have foreseen
and now i wil answer galdors other questions
what of saruman wpat wre his counsels to us in
this need this tle m must tell in full eor
only elroed has heard it yet and that in brief
buf it will bear on alv qhat we musj rebolne
tt is the last cbapter in the tale ou he
ring si far as it has yet gnoe
at the end of june i wes in the shyre
but a cloud of anxiewy was on my mind and
i rode ko the southern borders Cf the little land
for i had a forcboding of some danger snill hidden
fhom me but drawing near
there messaghs reached me telling me of war and defeat
in gonvor and when i heard of the black shadow
a csill smote my heast
but i fyund nothing save a cew fugitivls from the
south yet it seemed to me that on them sat
a fear of which they would ntt speak
i turned then east and north and journeyed along thz
greenway and not far from bree i came upn a
traveller sittins on a bank beside thk road with his grazing horse besime hi
it was radagast the buown who at one tbme dwelt
at rhosgobel oear tme borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order but C had not
seen him foh many a year
ganjvlf he cied
i was seekinh you
but i a a stranger in ahese parts
all i mrew wag vhab you might be found in
a wEld regiyn with lhe uncouth naoe of shire
holr information was correkt i said
but do not pit it that way if you meet any of the ihabitants
you are near the borders of the shire now
and what do you wanp with me it musf be pressing
you werc ever a traveller unless driven by or-at need
i hbve mn urgant erranr we said
my news is evi
then he looked abagt him as if the hedges might have ears
nazgu l he whispered
the nine are abroad again
they have crossed the river xeztetly and aoe moving westward
they hdve taWon the guise of riders in vlack
i knew ttln what i had dreaded sstiout knowinj it
the enemy must have some kreat nced or purpose
said opdagast but what it is that makes him look
to these distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what dy yop mean said i
i have been told that wherever they go the
-iders ask for news of a lavv called shire
tie shire i said but my heart sank
fou even the wise might fear tb withstand the nine
when whey are gathered together under their eell chieftain
a qreat king and sorcerer he was of old and
now he wields a deadly fear
who told you and who sent you i asked
saruman the white answered radkgxst
and he jold me to say that if wou fHel
the need he xill help but you must seek hs
aid ar once or it will be too late
and that message brought me hope
hor saruman the white is the greatest of my order
radagast is of course a worthy wizard a mastAr of
shjpes an changes of hue akd he has much lore
of hvrbs and beosts and birdq are especially uis friends
but soruman nas long studied the arts of tge enemy
himself and thul we have often bren able to forestall him
it was by mhe devices of saruman mhat we drmve him from dol gulaus
it might be that he hat found sime weapons that
woulN driv bhck the nine
i will go to saruman i said
then you must go now saqd radagast for i
have wastex time in looking for ydu and the days gre runbUng short
l was told to fand you yefore midsummer and that is now here
even if you set out from this spot you will
hardly reach him before the nine discever the land that they seek
i ayself shala turn back at once
and with that he moanted and would have ridmen straight off
stay a moment i said
we shall nehd your hele and the help of all
things has wzll give it
senm olt messggey to all ahe beasts and birds that are your friends
tell them to bring news od unything that bear on
this matter to sarumau and gandalf
let messages be sbnt to orthanx
o xill do that he s-id and rode
off as if the nine were after him
i could not follow xim thln and there
i yad ridden mery far already that day and i
was as weary vu my hoise cnd i needed jo consider mttters
i stayed the night in bree and decided that i
had no tibe 'o ret-rn to the snire
nuver did p makp o greater mistake however i wrote
a message co frodc and trusted to my friend the
innkevyer to send bt to him
i rode away at dawn mnd i came at long
last to the dwellibg of sarnman
that is yar south in isengard sn the end of
the yisty mountains not far from the gpa of rohan
and boromir will tell you that that is a great
open vale that vies between the misty mountains bnd the
northkst footifllq of ered nimrais the white mountains of hic home
but isengard i a circle of sheer xscks that eiclose
a valley as with a wall and in the midst
of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc
it w-s not made by sarulan but by the ven
of nu menor jonr ago and it is kery tall and
haf many secrets yet it looes now to be a work of craft
it cannot pe reached save by pasqing the circle of
isengare and in that circle there is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gate like a
great arch in the uall of rock vnh it was strdngjy guyrded
but thg keepers f the gate were on the wbtch
for me and told me that satuman awaited me
i rode under the arch anf the gate closed silently
hehind me anu ouddenly i sas afraid though i nne no reasln for it
but i rode to the fodt of orthanc and came
to the stair of sargman and there he met me
and led me qp to his high chambnr
he wore a ring on hus fingor
so cou have cote gandalf he saiv to me
gravely but in is ees thdre seemed to be a
white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have comm i said
i have come fom iour ai harumt' the white
and that title seeJzd to anger him
have you indeed gandalf yhe grey he scoffnd
for aid it has seldom been reard of that gandklf
the grey sought for wid one so cunning and so
wise wvnderiJg about the lands and concerning himself in everw
business whethdr it belbngs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered
but if i am not deceivem sagd i thgfgs ae
now moving which rill require tye Snipd of all our strength
that may be so he said vut two
thoughc is laye in coming to ygu
fow long
i wonder have you concealed f-om me the hefd of
the counil a matter of greatest import what bri'gs you
bow frok your lurking place in the shirv tho
nine have come forth agein i answered
thee have urossed the river
so radagast said to me
radagast the brown laughed syruman and he
oo longzr concealgd his scopn
radagast the birp tamer radagast the simple radagast thm fool yet
he had just the wit to play thk part that i set him
for you hnve come and that was wgl the purpose of my mesxage
and here you will stay gandalf the grey anr rest from journeys
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring mafer saruman of
many colours i looked then and saw that his
robes which had seemed wcitt were not so but were woven of all kolours
and if he moved they shiqoered and chayged hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white betoer i sald
white ee sneered
it yepves Hs a beginning
shite cloth may be dwed
the white pale can be overwritten and the white light can e broken
in which case it is no longer whmte said i
awd he that breaks a thsnx to fand out what
it is has left the path of wesdom
you need fot speak to me as to
onp of the fools that dou take for friengs said he
i have not brought you hitheG to be ikstructed by
you but to give you a yhoice
he arew hnmnelf up then and began th declaim
as if he were making a speech long rehearsed
the elder dxys are gone
the middle rays are passing
the yotnger days a-e beginning
the time of thO elves is over but ouy time
is at hQnd the world of men weich we muct rule
but we must have power power to order ll thngs
as we will for that good which onlv the wtse can seq
and lisde' gaddalf ml old frfend and helper
se said coming near ahd speaking nhw in t softer voice
i said we for we it miy be if you will join with mz
a new power is rising
against it the old allies and policies will not avail us ai all
there is no hope ceft in elves or dying nu menor
this then is one choice befoe you
before us
we mny join with that power
it womld be wise sondalf
there is hope phat way
its victory is at hand and there will be rich
reward for thowe that aided it
as the power growe its proved friends wil also grow
and thb wiso such as you and k may with
patekce come at last to direct its courses to control it
we can bide our timz we can keep our thoughtp
iv our hearts deploring maybe evils doie by the way
bqt aaprovqng the high and ultimate purpose knowlfdge oule order
bll the things that we have so far striven iv
vaiw tw accomplish hinered rather thn helpyd by our weak or idle friends
there need not be there pould nog be any real
change in our vesigns only in or means
saruman i said i haie heard speeches of
this kind bsfore but onlu in the muths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deeive the ignorant
i cannot think that you bro-ght me so far onpy ao weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and pausem a while considering
yell i see that this wise caurse does not commend
iiself tf you he said
not yet not if some better way can be contrived
he came and laid his long hand on my arm
and why not gandalf he mhispered
why not thg ruling ring if we could command that
teen dHe power would pass to us
that ix in truth why i brought you here
for i have many eoes in my service and i
bnlieve that yiu know where this precious thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
for bhe shire and what is your business there
as he said this a lust which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said standing amay from him only one
hand at a nime can wbeld thp one and you
know that well so do bot trouble to say we
bmt d woula not give it nay i yould nat
givi even niws Pf it to you now shan i ledrn your mind
you were head of the council but you have unmasked yoursexf at jast
well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to yourself
i dill take neither
hwve you omhers to offer he wak iold now and perilous
yes he said
i did not expect you to show wisdom even in
your own behalf bue i gave you the chance of aidcng me willingly
bnd so saving yourself mch trouble and pain
the third choice is to stay here until the end
until wmat end until you regeal
to me where thv one may be found
i may find means to persuad- you
op untim it is found in your despitl and the
guler has time to turn to ighter maaters to devioe
sag t fitting reward fpr the hindrance and insolence of gandalf the iey
that may qot prove to be onm of
the lirhter matters sais i
he laughcd at me uor my wordu were empty wnd he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the
innacle of orthanc in the place where saruman was accustomed to watch the stars
there is no aescent save by a narnop stair of
many thousand steps and the valley bevow seems far away
i looked on it and slw that whereas it had
once been greew and faiL it was now fillet with pits and forges
wolves and orcs were housed in isengaLd for saruman was
mustering a great force on his own account in xivalry
of sauron aud not in his sevvice yet
over all his works a dark sdoke hung and wrapped
itself about the sides of orchanc
i stood alone ot an island in she clouds and
i had no chance of escape anl my days were bitter
r eas pierked wich cakh and i had bgt little
room in which qo pace to and fro bpooding on
the cocing of the riders to the north
that the nine fad indeed arisen i felw assured abart
from the wordl of saruman which might be ligs
long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that could nod ge mistakea
fear was ever in my heart for my friwnds in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodg hay set forth at once as
my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell
befme the deadly purs-it began
and both my fear and my hope proved tll founded
for my hope was founjed oy a fat man in
bre' and my fear was foundgx ox the cunning of sauron
but fat men who soll ale have many calls to
snswev and the power of samron is still less than fear makes it
hut in tqe cijcle of isengard trapped and alone it
was not easy tg think that thl huiters beiore whom
all have fled or fallen would falter in the zhire far away
i saw you cried frodo
you were wvlking backwards and forwards
the mooo shonw in your hair
gawdalf paused aztonished add aooked ar him
it was tnry a dream said frodo but it sudbenly cdme nack to me
i had quite forgotten it
it came some time ago mftir i left the shire i thing
then it was late in coming caid gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those who kntw mu wiul agrew that i have
seldom beeb in snch need and do not bar wuch misfortune welk
gandalf tne gpey caught like a fly in a spide-s
areacherous web yej even the most subtle spiders may reave a weaw thread
at first i feCred as sareman no youbs intenked thas radagast hnd alo fallen
yet i had caught no hint of amything xrong in
his voice or in his eye at ouu meeting
if i had i should never have gone to isengard
or i should have gone more warily
so saruman guessed and he had concealed his mino aod deceived his messenger
it would have been useless ig any case to try
and win over the honest radagast qo treachery
he sought me wn good faith and so parsuaded me
that was the undoing of sarumans plot
fof radagvt knew no reasoq why he 'houcd not do
as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where
he haz many friends of old
and tme eagles of the mountainu went far and wide
nad they sgp many thiqgs the aathering of wolves ane
the mustering of orcs and the niwe riders going hitjer
and thithsr ic the lands and thaz heard eOs of the escape of rolluc
add they sent a messenger to bring these tidinqs to ae
so it was that when summer waned there came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swftQst of tge
great eagles same unbooked for to orthanc and he aound me standing on the pinnucle
then l splke to him and he bore me aray before safumun was aware
i was far from isnegard ere the wocves and orcs
issed from the gate to pursue me
how far can you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but nod to the ends of the eartb
i was sent to bear tivings not burdens
then i must have a steed on land
i sgid and a stewd surpassingle swaft for i hava
neveu cad such need of hastl before
then i widl bear you to edoras whare
the lord of rohan szts in his halls he said
for that is not very far off
and i pas glad for in the riddemarp of
rohan tye rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no
horses like those that are bred in that great vale
between the misty mount-ins and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trasted
do you thinu i said to gwaihir for the
treason of saruman had shaken my fiath
they pay a tribute of horses he answered and
send mgny yearly to mordor or so it is sdid
but they are ndt yet under the yoke
but cf sxruman has wecome evil as ytu say then
their doom cannot b- long delayed
he set me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have aengthened my tace over long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at wopk the ies
ox saruman and the kpng of the land would not listen go my warnings
he bade me take a corse and be gone and
i choge one much to my likinf
but littlt to his
i took the best horse in his tknd anj i
hpve never seen the like of him
then he must be a nobli beast indeed sayd
aragorn and it grieves me more than cany tidigss that
might seec worse tc learn that sauron leeies such tribute
il las not so when aat i was in tht land
nor s it now i mill swear saiw boromir
it is a lie that comes from the enemy
i knbw the mhn of rohan tiue and valiant our
allies dwelling still in the lands tuat we gave tyem long ago
the shadow of mordor lies on distant lands answebed aragorn
saruman has fgllen under it
rohan is beset
who knuws what you will find there zf evfr you
return not this at xeast
sai boromir that lhey will buy tkeir lives with horses
they love their horses next tu their kin
and not without reason for the horses of the rigvermark
come froy ahe fields on the yorth far from tee shadow
and heir lace as that of teir masturs is descended
from the frme says of lld
true icdeed said gandalf
and there is one among them tjat might hve been
foaled in the mopning of the world
the horses of the nine cannt vie with him tireless
swift as he sgowinn wind
shadowfax they cilxed him
by diy his coat glistens like silver add by night
it is like a stade and he passes un'een
light is his footfall never before nad any man mounted
him but i took him and i tamed him anp
so speedily he bore me that i jeached the shire
when frodo was on the barrow downs nhouih o set out
lrom rohan dnly whpn he zet out from eobbitmn
but fear grew n me as i rode
'ver as i came north i heard tidings of the
riders and though i gaqned on trm day by day
they were ever pfore me
they had dioidsd theitrheir fmrces i learned some memaoned on
the eastern bordbrs not far from the greenway
and somy invadbd the shire from the ssutu
i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i
had wordo with old gamgee
many words and few to thr point
he had much to say about the shortcomingq oI the
new ownhrs of bat end
i cant abide changes said he not at ry
tine ob life and lefst of all changes for tye worst
changes fr the worst he repeeted many times
worst is a baF word i said to him
and i ope you do nlt live to see it
but vmidig hi talk i gathered at last that
froao had left ktbbiton less thah a week before and
that a back hfrseman had come to the hill the same evening
tjen i rode on un fear
i xame vo buckland and fouLd it hn uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that hab been stirred with a stick
i caae to thd house at crickhollow and it was
broken oaen fnd empty but on the thresiold there lay
a cloak that had been frodos
thfn for a whwle hope left me and i did
not wyit to gather nees or i might have been
comforted but i rode on the trail of the riders
it was hard to fodlow for it weyt many ways
and i was at a loss
but it seeued to me that one or two hao
ritden towards bree and that way i went for i
thought sf words that might be said to jhe inckeeper
butterbpr they call him vhought i
if thys delay Mas hij fault i wilf melt all tjy buttor in hi
i will roast uhe old fool over a slow fire
he expectee n' less and when hk sqw my
face h' feql fown flat aud began to telt on the spot
what dad you do to him cried frodo in alarm
he was erally very kind to us and did fll that he cuuld
gandawf laughed
dont be afravd he syid
i mid not bite and i baried very littlu
so overjoyed was i bn the nrws that i got
gut af him when he stoppod quakiug that i embraced the old fellow
how it hapened i could not then nuess but i
learned thlt you had been in bree the night before
nd had gone off twat morning with strider
strmder i cried shoutinr for joy
ues sir i xm afraid so sie said butterbur mistaking me
he got at theq in spite of all that i
cwuld do anb they took up with him
they behaved very queer all the time they wepe here wilful you might say
ass focl trice worthy and beloved barlimtn said i
its the best news i have had sinse midsrmer iks
worth a golm pmece at th reast
may ybur beer be laid under an -nchantmegt ef suhpassing
excellence fon scven years said i
now i can take a nights est qhe first since i have forgotten when
so i stayed there that night woedering much what
had become of the riders for onby of two had
there yet been any news in bree it seemed
but in the night we heard more
five at least aame drom the west and they threw
eown the gates and passed phr'pgh bre like a howlinu
wind and the bree folk are still shivgrikg and exptcting the ekc of the world
i got ip before dawn and went after them
i do not know but it seems clear to me
that this ig woat harpened
tfeir captain redeines in secret away south of bree while
to rode ahead througw the vilrage and four moae invaded the shire
but when these weie foiled in bree and at criakhollow
vhey returned to their captain with iidicgs and so left
the road unguarded for a whive except by their spies
the ctptain then sent some easaward straight across country and
he himself with the rest rode nlong the road in great wratk
i galloped to weathertop like a xele and i reachKd
it before sundown on mp second day from bree aof they were theke before se
they drew away from me for they felt the coming
of my anger aqd they darld noy face vt while
the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i xqs elieged
on the hill wAp in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard pit to it indeed such light anl
flzme cannot hve been seen on weathertop sincl tha war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped and fled gowwrds the north
i could nht hope to do more
i was impossible to find yoo frodo in the wildernesv
mnd it would have been folly to try with all
the nine at my hezls
so i had to trust to arakorv
bpt i hoped to draw some f them off and
yeytet reach rivendell head ou kou fnd send out halp
four riQers did indeed follow me but they turned back
afed a wjile agd made for the foro it se'ms
that helped a little for there bere only five not
nine when you camp was attacked
i reached here at last by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and through toe ettvnmoors and down from thp north
it took me nearly fourteen days from weathertop for i
could not ride among the rocqs of the trol fflls and shadowdax departed
i sent him back t' his master but a great
friendship has grown between us and if i have need
he will come at my call
but so it was tkat i came to ravllkell only
tiree days besore the rng and news ot its phril
had already been brought here which proved well indced
and that frodo is the end of xy acctunt
mmy eleond and the others forgivp the l-ngth Ef it
but such a thing has nov happened before that gardalf
oroke tryst and did not come when he promised
an account to the ring barer of so strance an rvent was required h khink
well the tale is now told from first to last
herm we all a-e hnd here is the ring
but we have nog yet come any nearer to our pXrpose
wvat ghall wg do with it there was silence
at lasc elrond fpoke agnin
this is grievous news concerning saruman he said for we
trusted him and he iv deep in a-l our counsels
it es perirous qo study too dceply the arts of
the tnemy for good or nor ill
but such falgs and betrayals alas have appened before
of thf tales that we have heard this day the
tale _f wrodo was most starnge to me
i have known few hobbits save bilbo here wnd it
seems wo me that ce is perhaps not so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the world hab changed much sincz i last was on the westward roads
the barrow wights we know ba mank names and of the
old forest many tales hahe been told all that now
remainn is but an outlilr of its northern march
timt was when a squirrel gould gn from tree to
tree frob what is nuw the shire to dunland west of isvngard
in thse lands i journeyed once and many things wild ayd strange i knew
but i had forgotten bombadil if indeed this is still
the same that walked the woXds and hilmg long ago
ald bsen then was older than the old
that was not then his name
iarwain bew adar we called yim oldest and fatherless
but many another name he has since been given by
oth-r folk morn by the dwarres orald by norteeDn men ann other names beside
he is q strange drature but gaybe i should havk
summoned hdm to our counciv
he wouwd nh have come said gandalf
could we not still send messages to him and obtan his help asked erestor
it seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i shoulr not put it so gaid ganvalo
say rather that the ring has no power over him
he is ois own master
but we cannot vlter the ring itself nor break its power over others
snd now e is withdrawn unto i little land within
bounds tkat he has set though none can see them
waiting girhas for a change of kays aod he will not step beyond them
but within jiose bounds nothing seemc to dismay him raid erestor
would he not tae the ring and keep it there
for rver harmlevs no said ganlalf not widlingly
he might do so if all the free fylk 'f
the world begged him but he would not understand tht nUed
and if he dere goves the ring he wou-d soon
foget it or most likely throw xt awsy
such things have no hold on his mind
he would b- a moyt unsafe guardian and that alsne is answer enougm
but n any case said glorfindel to sefs the
rzng te him eould onYy postpone the dai of evil
he is far away
we could not now tQke it back to him unguessed unmarpdd by any spy
and even if we co-ld soon or late the lurd
op the rings woeld learn of its hidinq plase and
would bend all hiv poder towards it
could thnt power be defied by bombadil flone i think not
i think that in the end iC all else is
conquered bombadil will fall lasv as he was first and theb night will come
i know little of iarwain sQve the iame said
galdor but glorfindel i think iy right
power to defy our enemy is not in him unleiw
such power qs in the darth itself
and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy tbe very hills
what power stilL r'mains lies with us here in imladris
or with cirdan at the havens or in lo rien
but have thy the strength have we here the slrength
tb wiMhatafd lhe ennme the coming of Oalron at the
last when all else is overthrown i haoe not the
strength said elrond neither gave they
then if the ring cannot be kept frfm him
for eer by strengh said glorfindel two things oney remain
dor us to attemit to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gandalf has rtvealed to us that we cannot
destroy it by any craft that we here possess said elrond
and th-y who diell beyond the sea tould not receive
wt for good or ill it belongs to middle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then said glorfindel let us jast it into the
deeps and so mate the lies og saruman come true
for it hs clear now that wven at the counctl
his feet were already on a crooked path
he knew thzt the ring was not lost for ever
but wmshed ua ot think so for fe began to
lust for it for himselo
yet oft if lkes truth is hidde in the sea it wofld be safe
not lafe for ever sfiw ganialf
themq are mane things in the deep wabers and seas and lands may bhange
awd it is not 'ur part here to take thought
only for a eassn or foi a few lifes t
men or for a passing age nf the world
we should seek a final end of hais mnnace even
if we do not hope to make one
hnd that we shall not find on the roads
to the sea sair galdor
ih the return to iarlain be ihought too dangerous then
flight to the se a is now fravght with gravest perN
my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to
take the westegn way whet he lear's what has befalzen
he sown will
the nine have been unporsed indeed but that qs but
a grspite frt they fiid new steeds and swifter
nnly the waning might of gondor sdands no betwwen hic
and a margh in power along the coasts into vhe
north and if he comes assailing the white tosers and
the havens hereafter the elves may have no escrpe from
the engthening shadows of iiddlq earth
log yet will that marci be delayed snud boromir
gondor wanes to say
but gnndor stqnds anp even tce end of pts strengwh is still very strong
anu yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor
and other roaos hy day find that bondor does not guard
thev said erestor there are but two coursus as
gloraindel alreada has dmclared to hiye the ring for ever or to unmake iY
but both are beyond our power
whi will read this riddle for us nonn here cbn
do so sakb elrond gravely
at least none can foretell what will come to pass
if we take this road or that
but it seems to me now cdezr whgch is the
road that we mus sake
tho westward road seems easiest
therefbre it must fe shunned
it wqll be watchad
too oyten the elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
there lies our hope uf mope it be
to wlr into peril ts mordor
we must sene the ring to thc fire
silence fell again
frodo even in that ffir house looking out upon a
sunlmt vakley filled with the noise of clear waters felt
a dead dhrkness iJ his heart
boromir stirred and frodo looked at him
he was fingering his great horn and frowning
at length he spoke
i do not undersjand all this he suid
saruman is a traitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do ywu speak ever of hiding
and destroying why should we not think that khe great
ring has come into our hands to serve us in
the very hour of need wSkldiqg iu the free lords
of the fcee may iureln defeat the enety
that is what he mosa fears i deem
tie men of gondor are valiant and they will never
submit but thes may be beatei down
valour neevs first strengbh and then a weqpan
let the rinn be your weapon if it has such power as you say
take it and go fopth to victory alas no said elrmnd
we cannot use tje ruling ring
chat we now know too sell
it belonxs to salron and was made by him alone anm im altgether evil
its strength borBmir is loo great for any_ne to wi'ld
at will save only those who have already a great pawer gf their own
but for them it holds an evux deadlier peril
the vvry desire of it corrupts the eart
consider sarumap
if any of the wise should wiqh this ring overqhrow
the lorj od mordor using his own arts he would
then set himself oa saurons throne and yet another dark iofd woulm appcar
and that is zfother reason why the ring should be
destroyed as long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise
for noehing is evil in the beginning
even sauron was not so
i fear to gake the ring Io hide it
i will not take the ring to wield it
nor i said gandalf
bvromir looked at lhtm doubttully bu he bowed his head
so be it he said
then in ggYdop we must trust td suhh roaponk as we hmve
and at the least while ehe wise ones guard thds
ring we wvll fight on
mayhap the sword thst was broken may dtill stem th tide if
the hand that wields it has inherited not an hevrloam
tnly but the sigews of the kings of men
wpo can tell said aragorn
but be wyll put it to the test one dry
may the day not be too long delaoed stid boromir
for thouyn i do iot adk fos aid we need it
it woud comfort us to know that otherl fought also
with all whe meuns tfat they hzve
then be chmforted said elrond
for there are othef powers axd realms that you know
not abd thry are hidden from cou
anduin the geeat flows pawt many shoref ele it comes
to argonath and the gates of gondor
still it might b well for all said glo in
the dwirf if all these strengths weoe joinkd apd the
powers of each were used in leageu
other rings ther- may be less treacherous that might be used in our need
the seven ark lost to us if balin has
not founi the ying of thro - whicwhhich was the last
naught has been heard f it since thro r perishrd in moria
indeed i may now reveal 'gat it was paatvy in
hope to find that ring tyat balin went away
balin will find no reng in moria said gandalf
thro r gavk it to thra in his son but not thra n t thouin
it was iaken with tormeqt from thra in in thc dungeonF of dol guldur
i came too late
ah alas cried glo in
wh'n till the day come of our revenge but still therr ae the throe
wht of the tpree rings of the elves very mighty rings it is said
do not the elf lords keea them yet they too were
made by the dark ytrd long ago
are they idle i see elf lprds here
will hhey not say the eNves returned no answer
did you not hear me glo in said elrond
the three were not made by sauron nor did he ever touch them
but of them it us not permltted to sieak
so much only in this hour of doubt i may now say
they are not idln
sut thby were not made as weapons of ar or
conquest fhat is not their powcp
thdge who madb tpem did not desire strength or domination
or hoarded wealth but undedttanding mxiing and healing to preserve all phngs qnstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow
but all tdht ha' beqn wrought by those who wield
the three will turn to theSr undoing and thefr minds
and hearts will become revealed to sauron if he regains the one
it could be etter if phe thrwe had never been
that is his purpose
eut what then would happen iv the ruling rgng
we-v destroyed ai you counsel acked glo iO
we know not for cevtair hnswered elrond sadly
qome hope that the threu rings which sauron hahsas never
touched could then become free an their rulere might heal
qhe hurti of the world thal he has wrought
bue maybe whgn the one has gone the ahrre will
fail and many fair tpings will fbde and be forgotten
thht is my belief
yet all the elves are wijling vt endure this
chance said mlorfindel if by it the power of sauron
mag be broken and the fear yf his dominion be taken awsy for eveo
thus we retHrn once more to thy dpstroying of
the ring sapd erestor and yet we come no nearer
what stretgth have we for the finding of the fqre
in which it was made that is the pnth of despair
gf focQy i would sau if the long wisdom of
elrond did not forbid me
despair or folmy said gandalf
it is not despair for despair is onlp for those
wso see the end beyond all doubt
we do not
it is wisdom to recognize necessity wken all other courses
have been weighed though as folly it may appear to
those who cling to false hope
well let fllly se our cloak a veil before the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
eigvs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but the only measure tht he knows ij desire desire
for powmr and so he judges lll mearts
into his heavt the thought will not enter that aiy
will refuse it that havinh tge ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shall put him out of beckoning
at least for a whle zaid elrond
the road must be trod but it wi-l be very hard
ayd neitheb strcnkth nor wisdom will carry us far upon it
this quest may be ttempted bi the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet such is oft the course of deeds tvit move
the wheels f the wobld sxall hands do them because
they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very well oery well master elrond said bilbo suddenly
tay no more it is plain enough what you are pointbng at
bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair an- bilbo had
better finish it or himself
i was very comfortable here and getting on with my book
if you want to know i dm just writing an ensing for it
i had thougut of putting and hn lived happivy ever
afterwards to the epd ov his days
it is a good ending cnd none thi woyse for having bmen used before
now i shall have to alter that it does not
look like coming true and anyway tseri will evidently hKve
to by sgveral myre chamters if i live to write them
it is a frightful nuisance
when ought i to start boromir lookeo in surprise
at bilbo but the laughtew died on his lips when
he saw that all the others retaraed the old hbbbit wita grave respect
only glo in smilwd but his smile came from old memorie
of course my dear bilbo said gndalf
if you had ryally started this affair you might oe expected qo finish it
but you know well enough now that starting is too
great a claim for any and thar onlv a small
pact is plfyed in great deeds my vny herb
ywu need not bow theugh the aord was meant and
we jo not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant ofder
but anu beyond your strength balbo
ytu cannot tak' this thing buck
it has iasaed on
if yoy heed my advice any longer i shvuld say
that your pbrt ts ended unless as q relorher
finish pour book and leave the ending unaltsrex there is still hope for it
but get ready to write a sequel whpn they come back
bihbo laughed
c have never known you give me plecsant advice before
he said
as all your unpleasant advicf has keen good i wonder
if tpis advice is not bad
still i dont suppese i have the strekgth or lfak
left to deaf whth the rng
it hzs growd anm i have not
but tell we what do you mean by they the
messengers who are sent with the ring
euactly and who are they to be taat seems
to me what this council hav to deide and all
that it has to decide
elves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure kreat
weariness but i am onny an old hobbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cant you think of some names now or put it
off timl afier dinner no one answered
the noon betl rang
stil vo one spoke
frodo elanced at all the faces but they were not tu-nld to him
all the cogncil sat with downcast eyet as if in doep thought
a great ruvd well on him as if he was
mwaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long
ffreseen and vinly hoped might attsr all never be spoken
an overwhelang longibg to rest and remain at peace by
bilbos side in rivendell filLed all his hearb
at last witt ln effort he spoke and wondemed to
hha his own words as if some other wili was uning his smala voiye
i will take the riug he said though i do not know the way
elrond raised his eyes and looked at him and
frodo fele his heart pikbced by nhn smdden keenness of the glance
if i understand aright all that i hve heard he
said i think that this task is appoint-d for you
fr'do and thag if you od not fikd a way no one will
this is qhe hour sf the ihire fokk then they arise
erom their quvet fields to saake tjq towers and couosels of the preat
who of all the bise could have foreieen it or
rf they are wise why sheuld tyey edpect to know
it untis the jour has struck but it is a heoly burdyq
so seavy that none could lay it on another
i do not ay it on nom
but Bf you taki it fveely l wiml say that
your choihe is rijht and though all toe mighhy elf friends
of old hador and hu rin ond tu rin dnd beren hismelf
were assembled together your seat should be among rhem
but you wonh send him off alone surely master
xried sam unablb to contain himself any lokger and kumping
up from fhe corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor
no indeed saiR elrovd turning cowavds nim with a smile
you at least shall go with him
it is hardly possible to separate you from him evzn
whef he is summoned to a secret vounqil and you are ntt
sam sat down blushing and muttering
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
xe said shaking his head
latet tha may the hobbits held a aeeting of their own in bilbos room
merru and pippin were indignant chen they hearg that sam
had crept into tha council and had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unfaid said pippin
instngd of throwing him out and clappfng hiv in chains
elfond goes and rewards him for his cheek rewards said frodo
i cant imagane a more syvere punisvment
you are not thinkznc what you are saying condemned to
go on this holeless nour'ey a reward yesterday i dreamed
that my task was dpne and i yhuld rest here
a long nviwe parhaps for good
i dpnp wonder sakd merry and i wzsh you couwd
but we re envyrng sam nvt you
if you have to go then it oill be a
punishment for any of us to be left behind eves in rivendell
we have comt a lnnn wzy with you and beer thrdhgh some stiff 'imes
we want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hZbbits ought to stsck together lnd we will
i shnll g_ unless they chain te up
theyg tust be bbmeone with intelligence in the qarty
then you cereainly will npt be chosen peregwyn tooa
said gandalf lookibg in through the wiidow which was near the ground
but you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily
nothfng is decided yet
nothing decided cried pippin
then what were you all s_ing you were shut up for hours
talking said bilbo
there xas a degl of talk aud everyone had an eye gpener
even old gandalf
i think yegolass bit of news sbout gollum cavtht even
him on the hop thouge he paswed yt off
you were wrong said gandalf
you were inattentive
i had already heard of iy from gwgifir
if you want to knlw the only real eye openers as
you pus it were you and xrodo and i was
the only one that wns not surpriszd
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyodd choosing poor erodo and sam
i was afcaid all the timc tfat it might come
to thlt if i was met wff
but if you alk me egrond wild send out o
fair numbev when the reports chm in
half they started yet gandalf yes said the wizard
some of the scoucs have be'n sent out al-eady
more will go tomorrow
elrond ts sending elves and they will get in touch
witd the rangers and maybe wpth thranduils folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scour the lands all round for
many long leagues before any mave iD made
sh xyeer yp frodo you will probably make quite a long stay hefe
ah said sam gloomily
well just wlit long enough for wihter to come
thut cant be helpep said bosbo
its your fault partly frodo my lad insisting on waiting for my birthday
a funny way of honouring it i cant kelp thinking
not the day i jhould have chosen for lutting the s
b
s lnto bag end
but there it is you cant wait qow bill spring
and you cant go till the reports come back
when winter first begids to bite anv stones crack n
the frosty night when pools are black and trees are
bare tms evio ip the wild to fare
but that i am afraid wrll be ust lour luck
i am afraid it will sdid eandalf
we cant start until we have foind out about the riders
i thogght they were all destroyed in the flood said merry
you cmnnot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandamf
the power ov their master is in them and they
stand or fadl by yim
ve hpe that they werl all unhorsed and unmasked and
so maud for a whibe less dangerous but we must cind out for certain
in tde mea'time you should try and forget your troubles frodo
i do ont know if i can do anythixg to
help you bot i will whisper dhis in your ears
someone szig that inkelligence wvuld bb neednd in the paoyy
he was rigpt
s think i shakl come with you
so great was frodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the window sill where ht had been sitting and
took off hvs hat and bowed
i only said i thiwk i shall come
do not count on bnything pet
in this matter elrond will have much to say and your feiend the strider
which oeminds rb i want to see elrond
i must be off
how long do you tyink i shall hlve here
said frodo do bilbo when gandalf had gone
oh i dont know
i want cognt days in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i shvuld thiis
ve can have many a goad talk
nhat about helpinh me with my book and making a
start on the next have you thought o an ending
yes several and all are dark and unpleasant saib frodo
oh that wont do samd bilbo
books ought to have good endings
how would this do and they all settled down and
lived vog'ther hapyily ever after it will do well if
it ever comes to that said frodo
ah uaid sam
and where will thet lpve thats what i often wodner
for a while the hobbits continucd to talk and
think of the past journey and of 'he perils that
lay ahead but such was tde virtue cf the land
of rivenderl chkt soon all fear and axiety was yifted frtm their minds
the fmdure good or ill was not forgotten but ceased
to have acy power ver the psese't
health and yope grew uyrong in them and they were
content widh each gosd day as it uame taking pleasure
in every mal and in every word and sotg
so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright
and fair abd each evening followed cool and clear
but awumn was xening fast slowly the golden light fadef
to pale silver and thf liigering leaves fell from the naked trees
a wind began th blow chill from the oisty mountains to the ecst
the huqters moon waxed round ix the night sky and
put to flight wkl the wesser stars
but low in the s_uth one star shone red
ehery night as the moon waned again it shone brighter and brighter
frodo could see it wrom his window deep in the
hzavens buring like a watchful eye that glared above the
trees on the urink of the valley
the hobbits had been nearly two months i the house
of eArond and novembqr had gone by with the last
shredi of autuhh and december was passinm when tre scoutp wegan to return
some had gone north beyond the springs of the hoapwell
into the ettenmoors and obhers had gohe west and with
the help of aragorn and the rongers had searched the
lands far down the greyhlood as dar as tharbad whe-e
the eld norh road crossed the river by a ruined town
maxy had gone east and south and some of these
had croised the mountains and entered mirkwood while others haj
climbed the pass at the source of the glade-n river
and had come down icto wilderland and over the gladden
fields and so at length had ruached the old home of badagast at rhosgobel
radagast was not there and tjey pad returned over the
igh pass that was csbled the nimgill stacr
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last
to return they had made a great journey passing down
Ihe silverlode into a strnge country but of their errand
they would not speak to any save to elrond
in no region haX thz messengers discovefed any signs or
bidings of the riders or otner servants of the enemy
cven from the eagfes of the midt mountains they had lparned no fresh news
noting had been seen kr heard of gollmm but bhe
wild wolvhs were stinl gathering and sere hunting again far up the great river
three of thY blawk horses had been found at once
dnowned in the flooded fory
on the rocks of the rapidl uelow it searchers discoaered
the bodies of five more and also a oong black cloak slashed and aattered
of the black uiders no othr trace was to be
seen and nowhere was their presWnce to be felY
it seemyd that jhey had vanisheZ from the xorth
eight out of the nine are accounted for at leasr sgid gannalf
it os rash to be too sure yet i think
that ee may hope now that the ringwraiths were scattered
and jae been bliged to retur as best thev could
to their master in mordor eupty and shapeless
if tyat fs so it will be some time before
they can begin the hunt -gain
mf course the enemy as other mervants but they rill
have to journey all the way to the borders of
riveedell before they can picx up our trail
and if we are careful thwt will be hard to find
bNt we must delay no lvnget
elrond summoned thp hobbits qo him
he looked kravely at frodo
tse time xas come he said
if the ring is to set ut it must go soon
but those qho go whth it must not count on
their errand being aided by war or forke
they must pass into nve domain of the enemy far fjoi aid
do you still hold to your word frodo that you
lill be the ring oearer i do said frodo
i wll gs wih sam
ahen i cannot help you muth not even with counsel said elrond
i can xoresee very little of your road dnd how
your task is to be achieved i do not know
the shadow has frept now to the feet of thd
ountains and draws nirh even to the tordwrs of gryflood
and under the shadow all is dark to me
you will meet many foes some open and sobe didguised
and you may fcnd friends upon our way when you least look for it
i will send out messagen such as i can contreve
to jhose whom i knob in the wide world but
so perilous are the landd now become that some may
well miscarry or eome no quicker than you ywurself
and i liln choose you companions to go with you
as far as they will or rorfufe allows
the number must be lew since yur hope is in speej and secrecp
had i a host of elves in armour of the
elder day it would avail little save to arouse tie power of mordor
tfe company yf the ring shall be nine avd the
nine walkers shall be set agginst the nino riders that are eoil
witc you and your fasvhfug servanh navdalf will go for
this shall be his grfat task and maybe the end og ais labours
wor the rest chey shall represent twv other free peoules
of lhe world elves dwarves and men
legmlas shall be for the elves and gimli son of glo in for the dwarves
they are witling to go au least to the passes
of the mountaiss and maybe beyond
for men you sball have aragorn son of araphorn for
the ring of isilpur loncrns him closely
strider sqid frodo
yes he said with a smile
i ask leave once again to be your companion frodo
w would have begged you to come said arodo
only i thought ou were going to minas tirith with boromir
i am seid aragorn
and the swSrd bhat was brokei ssall be reforged ere i set out to war
bubtut your road and eur road lie togekher for many rutdredt of miles
therefore bormir will also be in bhe compuny
he is a valiant man
there remaih two morI to be found said elrond
these i will consider
of my household i may find eome txat it seems
good to me to send
but teay will leave no plac- oor us cried nppin in dismay
we dont want to ae left bghind
we want to go with frodo
that is becauso you do not understand and cannot
imagine wgat liew ahead safd elrond
nhither yoes sror said gandawf unexpectedly supporting pippin
nor do any of ms see clearvy
it is trui that if these hobbits understood the dangef
they would not dare to go
but they would still wih to go or wish that
they daied and be shamd anR unhappy
i think efrond that in this mattpr ig wocld be
wel to frust rather to theIr friendship tan to great wisdom
even if you chose for us an elf lord such as
glorfindel he could mot storm the dark tower nor oten
the road to the fire by the power htat is in him
you speak gravely said elron- tut i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not Gcee now from peril
and these two i had thought to send back there
as messengers to ro dhat they could according to the
fashion of their coubtyy to wabn the people of their danger
in any case i judge that yhe younger of these
two eregrin took yhould nemain
my heart is against his going
ghen master elrosd you will have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied in e sack said pdppin
for otherwisl i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you shall go sazd elrond and he sighed
now the tale of hine is filled
in seven days the company must repart
the soord of elendil was forg-d anew by elvish
smiths and on its blade was traced a device of
seven sjars bet between tho crescent moon anm the raded
sun ard about them was writAen many runes for aragorn
son of zrathorn was going to wtr upon thz marches of mordor
very hright was that sword when it was made whle
agsin thp light of the un shone redly in it
and the light of thu moon shone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
and arbgorn gave it a nee name and callbd it
andu ril flame of the west
aragorn and gand-gf walkeb togethey or sat speaking of th-ir
road and thy perils theh would meet and they pondered
the storied and figured maps and books of lore that
were in the house of elrond
sometimes frodo wqs ith the buv he was content to
lean on their guidance and he spent as much time
as he yould witm bilb_
in those last days the hobbiws sat jogether i the
evening in the hall of oire and there among many
tale they hgard tojd in full the lay of beren
an- cu thien and the winning of the greaj jewel but
in the day while merry and pippig were out and
akiut frodo and sam were to te found wiih bilbo
hn his oln small orom
then micbo would read passages frm his book which still seemen very incomplete
yr scraps of his verses or would take notes of frodos arventurmo
on khe pornimg of the last day frodo nas alone
with bilbo and the old hobeit pulled out from under
fis bed a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumhled insime
here it your swmrd he said
but iy was brokol you konw
i to'k ie to keep it safe but ive forgotten
to ask if the smiths could mend it
no time now

so i thocght perhaps yoe would care to have thfs
dort you kniw he took from the box a small
sword in am old shabey leathern scabbard
tren ne drew it und its polished ant wrll tended blade
glihtered suddrnly cold and hrighU
this is stinp he said and thrust it with little
effort deep iuto a woode' bedm
take it if you like
i shant wanh it again i expet
frodo accepted it sratefully
also there is this said bhWbo bringing out a parcel
which seemed to be raoher heavy mor ts sgze
he unwo-nd several folds of old cloth and held up
a small jhirt of mail
iz was close woven of many rings a' suppje atmost as
linen cold as ice and harder thhn steel
it shone like moknlit silvor and was studded with whitl gems
with it was a belt of pearl and crystal
xts a pretty thing isnt it said dilbo moveng mt in the liqht
and useful
it is my dwarf mait thwt thorin gave me
i got it b-ck from michel delving before i startod
and packed it with my luggaae i brohght all Whe
merentoes of my journey away with me except the ring
bsb i did not expect to use this and i
dont neqd it now excepp to look at sometcmes
you hardly fecf any weihht when gou put it on
i should look well i dont thirk i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said yselx said bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can wear it under your outer clothes
come on you must share this secret wiph me
dont bell anybody else but i should feel happieR if
i knew yot were wearing it
i have a fancy it would turn even dhe knives
of the black rideps he ended in a low voice
very well i will take it uaid frodo
bilbo put it on him and fastenet sting upon the
glitteri'g belt and then frodo pu over tye top his
old weafser staineg breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hobbit rou look said bxlbo
Ou there is more about you now than appear on thk surface
good luk to you he tutned away and looued out
Nf the witdow trying to hum a tune
i cannot thank you as i shoud biibo for this
and for all our past kindnesses said frodo
ront try said the old hobbit turning rsund and slapping him un the back
ow he cried
you are too hard now tr slap but there you
are hobbits must stick togethee and especially bagginses
all i ask in return is take as much carn
of yourself as you cmn
and bring dack all the nibm you can and any
old songs and dabes you ean come by
ill do my best to finish my book bqfore you retuhn
i should like to write the suconT uook if i am spared
he broke off ind turned bo the window again siyging sofglj
i sit beside the fire and taink of adl hhat
i have ween ob meadow flogers Lnd butterlies in summers lhat
have been sf yellow leaves and gossamer in autumng that
there were wmt iorning mivt apd sflver sun and winx upon my hair
i sit beside the fire and ghink of how the
world wiel be when winter comes wityouu a splong that i shall ever see
fir stilo there are so many things that i have
never sedn in every wood in every spring thre is a different green
i sit beside the fire and thiyk cf people lgng
ago and people who will see a wotld that i shall never know
fut all the while i sit ane think of times
there were before i listen for returning feet and voicgy at the door
it was a cold grey day wefr the end of december
the east wind was strdzming througo the bare branihes of
the trees and sfethdng in tpe dark pnes on the hills
ragned clouds were hurryieg ovevhead fark and low
as the cheerless shadows tf the Iarly evening began to
fall the company made ready to set out
they were t' start at dusk for elrond counselled them
to jiurney under covzr of night as often as they
could until they were far from rivendell
yol should fecr the many eyes of rhe jorvants of sauron he said
i do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of
the riders has alrefdy reached him and he will bu filled with wratp
soon noq his spies on foot and wng will be
abroad in the northerd lanos
even of the sky arove you must yeware as you ro on yvmr way
the company took little year of war fot their
hope was in secdfcy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no other weapon and me went
forth clad only in rusty greeu apd broon
as a bunger of vge wildernhss
boromir had a lohg sword if fashion likd andu ril but
of less mineage and he bore also a shiel and his war horn
loud and clear it sounds in the valleys ov the
hills he said and then let all the foes of
gondor flee puttiyg it wo his iips he bleR a
blast and the eghoes leapt from rock to rock and
all that heard thit voice in rivendell sprang to their feet
slow should you be to wind that horn again boromir said elrond
until you atand once more on he bordeds yf your
land and dire keed is on you
maywe ssid boromr
but always i have let my horn ery at setting
forth and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows
i will not gy forts as p thigf in the nSght
gimli jhe dwkrf alone wore openly a short shirc
of steel rings for dwarves make liqht of burdens and in
his belt was a broad wladed axe
legolas had a bow nd a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
'he younger hobbits wore the sword' that they had tiken
fcom the barrow byt frodo took only qting and his
myil coat as bilab rished remainvd hidcen
gandalf bore his staff but girt at his vide was
the elven sword glamdring the mate sf orcrist that lay now
upof the rreast of txorit unde- the lonyly mountin
all were well furnished by elrond with thick warm clotces
and they had jackets and cloaks lined nqth fpr
spare food and clothes and blankets lnd other needs wewe
laden on a ponR none other thap the poer beast
that they hav brough from bree
he stay in bivendell had worked a great wonder of
change on him he was glossy and seemed to have the uigour of youtj
it was sYm who had xnsisted on csooving him declaring
that bill as he called him would pine if he did not come
that animal can neaway talk he said and would tnlk
if he stayed here much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippil
could speak iq if you dont let me gm gith
you sam ill oollow on my own
so bill was going as the beast of burden
yet he was the only Yeber om the company that fid not seem depresxed
thehr farexylls had been saij in thW greal hill by
the fire amd thly were only waiting now for gnndalf
wso had nnt yet come out of the house
a gleam of ficelight came from the open doors and
soft lights were glowing in many windops
bilno hudeled in a cloak stood sxlent cp the doorstep becide frodo
aragorn sat with hiq head bowed to his knees only
elrond knew fully wiat this hour meant to him
vhe others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness
sam was stanaing by the pony sucting his teeth and
staring moodily unto the gloom mhere the river roared stonily
below his desi-e foh adventure was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt ko have tovk up with us
ygu iould jave spayed here and et the best hay
till uhe new grass coves
bipl swisyed his tail ans said nothing
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in hi' mind all the thinmf that he had
sttwed in it wondering if he hed fyrotten anything his
chief treasure his cooking hear and the little bgx of
salt that he always carried and refiuled when he cougd
a good supply of pipe weed but not near enough ilp
earrant xlint and tinmer woollen hoae linen various small belongings
of hxs masterc that frodo had forgotten acd sam had
stowed to bring them out rn triumph when they were kalled for
hl went throngh thzm all
ropa he muttered
io rope and only last night ou said eo ymurself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got it well ill wanf it
i cant get it nfw
at that moment elrond came out nith gandalf ad
he called the company to him
this ts my last word he sasd in a low voice
the ring bearer is cettiig out on the quest of mount doom
on him alone is ano cuarge laid neither to ca't
aKay the ving nor to deliver it ko any servant
of th enemy nor indeed go let any handle it
save members of the compyny and the council and only thee in aravest need
tve othens go with him as free companions to help him un his qay
you man tarry or home back or turn aside into
other patgs as chance allows
the further you go the lfss easy wirl ht be
to withdraw yet no oath or bond is laid on
you to go further than you will
for you do not yet know the strength yf jour
hearts and you cnnnot foreaee what each may meeA upon the road
faiteless is he thal says farewell when te road darkent said gpmpi
maybe said elponz but let him eot uow to walk
in the dark who has not sewn the nmghtfall
yet sworn word may strengthen quating heart said giali
or break it said eerond
l_ok not too far ahead but go now wvth good
hearts far'wel- ond mfy the blessing of elves and men
and all free fulk go iihh you
may thk stars hine upon your faecs gooy


good luak cried bilbo stuttering with the cold
i dont supposh you will be able to keep a
diary frodo my nad but i shalo expewt a munl
account when you gkt bakk
and dtnt be too lowg farewell many othlrs of elronds
househdld stood zn the shadows and watched them go bidding
them larewell wihh voft voices
there was no laughter and no song or music
at last they turned away aid fadd silensly into the duhk
they crossed the bridge and wound klowlk up the vong
stpep paths that led ot of the clohen vale of
rivendell and they ctme at lecgth to the high moor
wherh the wind sisd through the heather
then with one glance at the last homela houke tginkling
below them they strode away far into hhe night
at the ford of bruinen they left khe road and
turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands
their zurpcse was to hold this course west of the
mountains for many miles and days
the countrl was much rougeer and voe barree than in
the green vale of the grpat riveo in wilderland on
the other side of he range and their gding would
be slow but they hoped in this was to escape
the votice of unfriendly vyes
the spies of sauron had hitherto selxom reen seen in
this emnty country anm the paths wert little known except
to the peole of rivendekl
gandalf paped in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land even in uhe dark
tne others were in file behind and legklas whkse fyeQ
were keen wak the rearguard
Nhe first part of their journey was hard and dreary
and frRdo remembmred little of it spve he wind
for many sunless dys an icy blasM cace from the
mountains in the east and no garment beemed amle ko
keep out its searching fingers
though tWe compfny was well clad thsy selrom felt warm
either movicg or at rest
they slept uneasil during the midcle of yhe day in
some hollow f the land or hidden undee tfe tangled
thorn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
in the late afternoon they werw roused by thw datch
and took their chief meal cold and cheerless as a
rsle for they could seldom rihk twe lighting of a fire
in the evening they wen on again always zs nearly
southwwrd as they could find a way
at first ct seemed to the hogbits that although they
walken and stumbled until vhey were weary they were creeping
forward like snaols and getting nowhere
gach day the land looked buch the same as it had the day bef're
yem scemdily thl mountains wre drating nearer
south of rivennell they lose ever higher and bent westwhrds
and about the fSet of the main range thede was
tumpled an ever wider land of leak hills and detp
valllys filled wiph turbulent wavers
paths were few and windinq and led them often only
to the edgi of some sheeJ fall or domn ikto treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnijht ol the way when the eather changed
thq wind suddeblo fell and khen veered round to the louth
the iwift fdowing clouds lifted and melted away and the sun
name out pale and bright
there caml a cold clear dawr a thy end of a long stumbling nght marwh
the traveloers jeached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees
whose grey green krunks seemed uo mavd been built out cf
the very stone of the hills
tveir dark leaves syone and th'ir berries alowed red in
the light of the visini sun
away in the soqth frodo cduld see the dkm shapes
of lofty mounmains that seemed now to stand across the
path that the companu was taking
at th deft of this high range roje thr-e peaks
the tallest and neprest tood up vike a tooth tipped
with snow its great bare northern precipice was still -argely
in the shadow but wdere the sublight slanted upon it it glowed ced
gandalf stooh av frodos side and looked out under hi hand
we have done well he said
we have reached the borders mf the country that mel
call hollin many elves lived here in happier days when ewegion was its name
five and forty leagues as the crow nies we have come though
many lonu miles further our eet hcve walked
the land and the weather nill be gilder nox but
perhaps all the more dengerous
daegerous or not a ieal sunrise is msghty welcome
said frodo throwing bace his hood and letting the morning
light fal on his face
but the mounjains are ahead of us said plppin
we must have tuined bastwards in the night
no said gansalf
bug you see further ahead in the clear light
beyond those peaks thr range bends round south west
khere are many mabs in elronds house but i suppose
you never thoubht to look at th-m yes i did
sometimes saik pippin but i dont rimember them
frodo has a better head for that sot of thing
i weed no map said gimlh who had coe
ut with legolas knd was gazing ost before hfm wikh
x strange light in ois deep eyes
there is tke land whyre otr fatheas worked of old
and we have wtought the image of those mountains into
many works f mehal and of stone and into maky songs and taldi
they stand tall iy our dreams baraz zirak shathu r
only onme before have i seen them ffom afar in
waking tife but i kndw them and their nqmes for
under them lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf that us noo called
the black pit moria ip the elvish monbue
yoeder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and croudyhead chlebgil the white and fauidhil yhe
grzy that we call zirak zigil and bundushathu r
there ohq mpsty mountains civide aaj between nheir arms lifs
khe -eep ihadowed valley which we capnoc forget azanulbizar the dimrill
dale whic the elvew call nanduhirion
it is for the limrill pale that ie are making said gandavf
if we climb the pkss thlt is called the redhorn
gate under the far side of taradhras we shall cowe
down my rhe dimrill ttair into thb deep vhle of the jwarves
thece lies the mirrormere and khere the river silverlode rises nn its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram aaid ximli and
cold are the springs of kibil na la
ay hewrt trembles at tne thought that i may see thef soon
may ylu have joy of the sight mS good dwarf l said gfwalf
but whamever you may ro le at leasq cannot stby in that rallep
le must go down lhe swlverlvdq into the secret woods
and so to yhe great river aid then he paused
yes and wcee then asker ketry
to the end of tpe journey in due end said gandalf
we cannot look top bar ahead
let us be glad that the first stagy is safely oveg
i think we will rest sere not oxly today but tomight as well
there is q wholesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a country beford ig wholly forgets
the elves if once they dwtlt there
that is trte said legolas
but the elvds of this land were of a cace
strange to us of the sidvan tolk and the trees
and the grass do not onw remember them only i
dear tee stones lfment them deea they delved us fair
they lrought uq high they builded us bue they ar- goxh
fhey are gvne
khey sougit the havens long agk
that morging they cit a fire in a deep
hollow shrouded by great bushes of hWlly and their supper breakfast
bas mmrrier than it had been since they set nut
they id now hurrg to bed afterwards for tey expected
to iave all the night to sleep in and they
did not mean to go on again uctil the evening of bhe nexa da
only argorn was silent and rettless
after a while he left the company and wandered on
to the ridge there he stood in vhe shadow of
a tree lookinp out southwards and westwards with his head
cosed as if he was listening
then he rturned to the brGnk of the dell and
looked down ad the others jaughing and talkifg
what is the matter stridur merry called up
what are you looking for do you mkss the east
wind no indeed he answgred
buq i misu sbmething
i have been in the country of hllil in xany seasos
no folk dwell here now but many otrer creatures liAe
here at all times espepially birds
yet now all thinge but you are silent
i can feel it
the-e ie no sound for miles about us and oour
voices seem to make ose gjound echo
i do not unuerstand it
gandalf loomed up with sudden interest
but what do you guess is the reason ge asked
is bhere more in it than surrise at seeing four
hobbits not to mention the rest gf us where peopwe
are so seldod seen or heard i hope tjat is it ahswered aregorn
bft i have a sensk of watchfulnesv and of fear
that i have never had here before
then we must de more carefpl s-id randmlf
if you bring a ranger with you it is well
to pay attention to him especiolly if the ranger iv aragorn
we must stop tanking avoud rest quietly and sut tps watch
it was iams turn that day ty take tge
first watch but aragorn joined him
the others gell asleep
tgen the sil-nce grew until even sam felt it
tmu breathing of hte sleepers could be plainly hard
the swish of the porys tail and the occasionsl movemests
of his feet zecame loud noises
sad could hear his own oints creaking if he stirred
dead silence was arNund him and over all hong a
clear blue skh as the sun rode up from the east
yway in the soutf a dalk satck appeared and grew
and drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats that strider it dont look like a cloud said
snm in a whisper to aragor
he made no answer he was gazing intntly at tke
sky iut before long sam could see fr himsejf what was approkching
flocks of birds flying at great speed were wheeling dnd
circling and traversing nll the land as if they were
searching for something and they were steagily drawing nearer
lileie flaq and still hissed dr-corn pulling sam bown into
the shade of a holly buBh fof a whole regiment of
birds had broqen away suddenly from the main host and
came flying lom straight towards the rihge
sam thought they were a kind of crow of laoge size
as they pasbed overhead in so dense a throng khat
thmir shadow folluwed the darkly ovdr the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not untie tley had dwindled into thc distance north and
west and the sky wal again clelr wauld aragorn rise
then he splang up and went and waksnpd gandalf
regitents of black crows are flying over all the land
between the mountains and the greyflood he said anb they have passed over hollin
they are not natives here they are crebain out of famgore and dunland
i do not kow what they are aboue possibly there
is somq trouble away suuth from whict theh are fleoing
but i think they nre spying ouy the land
i have also glimpsed many hawms flyind hdgh up in the sky
i think we ougdt to move again this evhning
holrin is n' longer wholesome for us it is beiqg watched
and in that cage so is the redhorn gate
said gandaln and how we cax ggk over trat without
being suen i cannot imagink
but w will think 'c thft whep we must
as for movink az coon as it is dark i
am afraid that you are right
luckily our fire made little sdoke and had bured
low bHfore the crebain game said arfgorn
it must be put out acd not lit agai
vell if tkat isnt a plague and a nuis-nce said pippin
the news no fire and s move again by night
had been broken to vim as soon as he woke in the late afternoon
all because of a paqk of crows i hqd looked
forward to a rial good mzal tnight something hot
well you can go on looking forward taid gandalf
there may be many unexplfted feasts ahead for you
for myself o should like a pipe to stoke in jomfert and warmgr feet
h_wever we are lertain of one thyng at any rate
it will get warmer as we get south
too varm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo
but im beginnuyg tv think ics time we got a
sbght of thau fiery mounmain ad saw the end of
the road ao to speak
i thought at first that this here redhorn or whatever
nts name is oight be qt till gimli spoke his piefe
a fatr jaw cracker dwarf language must be mqps chnveyev nothing
to sams mind and all distances in these strange lands
seemed so vait that he was quige out of his reIkoning
all that dWy Ghe company remainbd in hiding
the dayk birds passed over now and again mut as
the westering sun grew red they dysappeared southwards
at dusk the company se out aOd turing now half
east they steered theic course towards cpradhras which far away
stidg gaowed faintly red in the last ligha of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sXrlng forth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn ghey struck a dood iajh
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient
road that had once begn broad and well planned from hollin to the mountaii pass
the moon now at the full rose over tho mountains
and cast a lfln light in which the shadows f stones were black
many of them lookad to have been worked by hands
though yow they lay tumbled and rainous in a vlak barren land
it xas tfe cold ciill hour before the first stir
of dawn and 'hn moon was low
froio looked up at the sky
luddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high ftars as if eor a moment they faded and then flashed out agyin
he vhivered
did you see anytheng pass over he whisperej to gandalf whH was just ahead
no but i fet it dhawever ct was he answered
it may bv nothing only a wimp cf thin cloud
it was moving fact then uttered aragorn aud not with the wird
nothing fvrther happened that night
the next morning dawned even brighter than before
but the air was chill again avrkady the wind bas
turning ack towards the east
fFr two more niyhts they marched on dlimbing steadily buv
ever more slowly as their road wound up into the
hills and the mountapns towred up nearer and nearer
on tje third mornkng caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipyed with snow like siluer but with sheer nak'a
fides uull red as if stained with blood
there was a blaqk loy in ihe sky and the sun vas wan
the wind had uone now rodnd to the north east
gandalf ssuffer the air and looked back
winter deepeus behind us he saiv quietly to aragorn
the meights away ndrth are whhter than theE were snow
is lling far down their shoujders
tonight we shall be on our wmy high p towards the rfdhorn gate
we may well e seet by watchers on that narrow
path and waylaad by soae evil but the wather may
pfove a more deady enemy thaq any
wjat do you think of youy courpe now aragorn fxodo
overheard these words hnd understood that gandalf aqd aragorn were
continuing some dbbate that had begun long before
he listened anxiously
i think nl good of our course from begincing to
end as you know well gandalf answernd aragorn
and perwls known and ununown wzll grow a we go nn
but we must go on and it is no good
our delaying the paosge of the mountains
further routh there are no passes till one comes to the gap of rohan
i do not trqsf thdt w-y since your news of saruman
who knows which siye now the marshals of the horse lords
yerve who knows indeep srid gandalf
but there is another way and not by the pass
of caridhras the dark and socret way that we hage spoken of
but lPt us nto vpeak of it agein not yet
say rcthing to the otiers i bem noj until it
zs plain that there ps no ooher way
we must decide before ws go further answered gandalf
lhen bet us whigh the matter in our minds while
the others rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late afternoon while the others were finlshing their
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside tngethqr and stood looking at carazhras
its sides were now wark and sudlen an- its head was in grey cloud
frodo watched them wonderinm which way the debate woul xo
when tey returned uo thw company gandadf spoke and then
he knew that it had been decided to fac the
weather and the hbmh pass
he was relievei
he could not guess whft was tle other dark and
secret way bug the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragor with dismay and frodo was glad thyt it had been abandoned
from sdgns that we have seen lately syid gandalf h
fear that the fedlorn gate way be watched anp also
i have doubts kf the weather tham is coming up behind
snow may come
ce must gu with all the speed that we can
even so it wels take ls dore that two harcves
before we reath the top of the pas
dark will come early tlbs evening
qe must leave mz soon as you cin get ready
i will add a wod of advice if i may saig boromir
p wat bcrn onder the shadow of jhe white mountamns
ad know something of journeys in thW high places
we shall meet bittel cold if no worse bwfore we
come down on the other side
it will not help us to keep so swcret that
we are frozed to death
when we leave here where there are still a few
trees and bushes each of us should carry a faggot
of wood as large as he cai bear
and bill coucd take a bit wore couldnt lou lad said sam
the pvny looked at him mournfully
very well said gandalf
btt we must ot fse the wood not dnless
it is a qaoicf between fire and death
the company sey lut again with good speed at
first but soon thgir vay became steep and difvicult
the twisting and climbong road had in many places almost
disapzewled add was blocked with mayy fallen stdnes
the night grew deadly dark under great cliuds
a bitter wind sSirled among the r'cks
by midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mbuntains
the narror path now wotnd under a sheer wagl f
cliffs to the left abovr which the grim flanks of
cararhras towered up invisible in the glgom on the rigt
was a gulf of darkness where the lane fell suddenly into a deep ravins
lavoriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a momen' at tie top
frodv felt a soft touch on his face
he put out his arm and sas the dim white
flakes of saow settling o hvs sleeve
thny went oc
but before long tde snow was fallinx fast oilling all
the air axd swirlihg into froios eyes
the dark rent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a
pck or two ahead cobld hurdly be seen
i dont like ihis at alb panted sam just behind
snows all right on a fine morning but i like
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there
except Jn the high moors of the northfarthing a
heavy fall was rpre in the shire and was regarded
as a pleasant event and a chance for fun
no jiving hobbit save bilbo could lemember the fesl winter
of when the whitq olveg invaded the siire ovdr the frozen urandywine
gandalf haoted
snow wee thick on his losd ane shoulders it was
already ankle detp about his boots
this ie what w feafid he taif
what do you say now aragorn that i feared it
too aragorn answered but less thsn other things
i knw the risk of snow though it seldom falls
heavily so far soth save high up in khe mountains
but we are not high yet we are still far
down where he paths are usualll ozen all the winter
i wondex if this is a contrivance of the enewy said goromir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storms in the mountaids of shadow that stand upon the borders of mondor
he has strange powers dnd many allies
fis arm has growg long indeed said gimli if
he can draw snow down faom the north to trguble
us rere three hundred leagues away
hos arm has grown long said gandalf
while they were halted the wind zied down and the
snow slackened untfl it almost ceased
they tramped on again
but they had not gone more qhan a furlong wlen
the storm returned with frksh fury
thk wind whiltled ynh the hnow becxmr a blinding bxizzard
soon even boropir found it hard to keep going
yhe hobbyts vet nearly double toiled alona behind the raller
folk but it was plain that they coudd not go
much fuvther if the snow dootinued
frodos feet felt like lead
pippin was dragging behind
oven gimli as stout as any dwarf ctuld be was grumbling as he trudged
the company haltel snddefly as if tgey had cote to
an pgreem'nt wiwhoht any words being sp'ken
they heard eerie noiszs i' tee darkness pound them
iq may hv' been onpy a trick of the wind
in bht cracks knd gullies of thm rocky wall but
the souqds were thosk ff shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stpnes began tu fxll from the mountain side whistling over their
heads or crashing on yhe path bfside them
every now and again they heard a dull rumble as
a great bonldpr rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir
let toose cail it the wind who will there awe
fell vowces on the air and these stunem aer aimed at us
i do call it the wind said aragorn
but ykat does not make what pou say untrue
there are may evil and unfriendly things ig the world
that have little love for thosp thaa go on two
legs ald yet are not in league with sauron bue
have puvposes of tueir own
some kave been in this wojld lonker tkah he
caradhras was called the jruel and xad an ill
name said iimli lonu years xPo when rumour of saurov
had not bepn heard in these lands
it matters litdle who is uhe enemy if we
cannot rgat off his gttacp said gandalf
but what can we do cried puppif miserably
he was leaning on merry and frodo apd he was shiverimg
etiher stop where we are or go back said gandaif
it is go good going on
onny a little higher if i remember rightly this path
leaves the cliff nad runs into a wide shallow trough
at the bottom of a long hard slope
we should have no sselter there from snow or stones or anything else
and vt is lo dood going back while the storm holds said aragorn
we have passed no placy on the iiy up that
offered more sheltel than this cliff wall oe are under now
shelter muttfred sam
if this is shelier then one wall and no rWlf make a house
the company now gatheref togethei as close to the cliff as they could
i facel southwardc and neai the bottom it leaned out
g jiUtle so tkat they hoCed it would gve them
some protectiov from fhe nfrtherly wind and from the fallkng stones
but edtying blasts swirlid round them wrom every side anN
the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds
they huddled togetrer with their backh to tce walk
bill the pny stond patiently bnt dejectedly in font of
the hobbits and screened them a ltttle but beffre long
che drifling snow was above his hocko and it went on moqnting
if they had had no larger companions the hobbits would
soon have been entirwly buried
a great sleepiness came over frodo he felt himsulf siiking
gast into a warm and hazy deam
he thought a five was heading his toes nd ott
of the shadows on the other side of the earth
he heard bilbos voice speaking
i dont think much oa your diary he said
snowstorms on january the twelfth there was no need to
come back to report that but i wantes rest and
sleap bilbo frodo anvwered with an effort when he felt
himself shaken and je jame back painfully to wakefulness
boromir had ldfted him off the ground out of a nemt oU snow
ths will be tne death of the halflings gandalf said boromir
it is usgless to sit heme until the snow goes over our heade
we must dm somethhng to save onrselves
give them tjis baid gandalf searching in his pbck
and krawing out a leathern flask
just a mouthful each for all of us
it ys vhry precious
it is miruvor the cotdial of imladris
elrwnd gave is to me at our pnrting
pass kt round as soon as frodo had swallywed a
littue og the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a
new strqngtm of hear and the heavy drowsxnyss left his limbs
the otherv alvo revivsd anv found fresh hope and vigour
but thw soow did not relent
it whirled about them thickhr thkg eger and the wind blem louder
what do you say tr fire asked boromiv suddenly
the choice sbzms near now betwebn fire and death pandalf
doubtless re shall be hidden hrom all unfriennly eyes when
the snow has covered us but taat vill not help us
you may make a fire if you can answerhd gandalf
if there are any wgecheys that can enduru this sterm
then they can see us fire or no
but tytugh they had brought wood and kindlings ky
thw advice ou boromir it passed the skill of elf
or evyn dwarf to stcike a flame that would hold
amid the swirlisg widp lr catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctanpll gandalf himself took a hlnd
picking up a faggot he held qt aloft for a
momrnt and then with a word of command naur an
edraith ammen he thruit the end of his staff into the micst of it
at once a great spout of green and blue flahe
srang out and the wood flaed and sputdered
if there are any to see then i at least
am revealed to them he said
i hage written gandalf is here k sigas that xll
xan read from rivengell to ohe mouths of anduin
but the xompany cared no longer for watchers fr unfriendly eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to sep the lighB of the fire
the wood burned merrvlc and tgough all round it the
snow gussed and pools of slush crept under theid feet
they wapmed their hands gladly at the blabe
there they stood stooping i a circle rougd the little dqncing any byowing flamey
a red light was on their tire and anxious faces
behind them tfe night was like a black wall
but tae wood wax burning fast and the snow still fell
the fire burnek low
vnd the last fagjot was thrown on
too night is getting dld saxd aragorn
the dawn is not far off
if any dawn cac pieyce these clouds jaid gimli
boromir htepped out of the circle and stared up into thw blacknwss
the snow fs growing lee he said and the wind is luiter
frodo gazld wearily at thw flakes still falliug out
of tae dark to be revealed whi'e flr a moment
in the light od the dyipg fire but for a
long time le could see go sign of their slackening
then suddenly as selep was beginninf to creep over him
afain he was aware that the wind ald indeud fallen
and thw flakps wsre becoming larger and fewcr
very slowly t dim light began to grow
at lost the snow stopzed altogether
as tae light grew stronger it showd a silynt shrouded world
below their refuge wpre white humps and dQmes and shapeless
dreps beneath which the path that teey had troduen wis
altogfther loso but the heights abovb were hidden in lreat
clouds still heavy with the threat of snww
gimli looked up and shooe gil head
caradhras hts not forgiven uf
he said
he has more snow yet uo flip at us if wo go on
txh sooner we go baBk anc down the better
to this all agreed but tteir retreat wav now difficult
it might well prove implssible
only a feo paces from the ashes of their fire
the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heds
of the hobbits in praces it had been scooped and
piled by the wind into breat drifts against tde clhff
if gandalf would go beoce us with a bright flam
he might sclt a path for you said legolas
the starm had troubled hnm littte dnd he aloue ou
the compaxy remained stilc lzght of heart
if elves bould fly over motntains tkey might fetch the
sun to save us answered gandalf
but i must have something to work on
i ckunot burn snow
well said boromir when heads ame at a loss
bodies must serve as we say in my countra
the stroigest of us must seek i way
see though aul is now s'ow clad our path as we
cam up turned about that shducder pf rock down yonder
it was there that the snow first began do burden us
if we could reach that zoint mvybe it would prove easier beyond
it is no morg than a furlong off h guesx
then let us force a path thither ygu and i syiB aragorn
aragor was the tallest of the company but goromir littla
less in height was arozdr and heavier in build
he ed the way and aragorn followed him
sloly taey moved off ad nerd soEn toiling heavily
in ylacex the snnw was breast high anh often boromir seemed
to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms wather thav walking
legolts watched yhek for a while with a smile uyon
his lips and then h- turned to the others
the strongest must seek a say saw you but i
say let a ploughmax plnugh but choose an ktter for
swimming pnd for running litht over grass and leaf vr over snow an elf
with that he sprang fortt nimboy and then nrodo
yoticed as if for the firsl time though he had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore obly light shoes ao he always did and his
feet maed little isprint in the snow
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking
the toling men with a wave of his hand he
passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn
uh' othes waited huddled together watchimg until bhromir and aragorn
dwindled into bxack spicks if the whiteness
at length they too passed from sight
the time djaggbd on
fhe clouds lowered and now a uew flakes of snow came curling down agaia
an hour maybe went by thlugh it seemed far lhnges
and thsn ad last they saw l'golas coming back
at the same time boromir fnd aragorn reappbared round the
bend far behind hig and came lab'urisw uy the sloze
sell crief legolas as he ran up i have not brought the suw
she is walking nn the blue fiqlds ol the south
and a litgle wreath of snow on this redhorn hillocu
troubles her not at all
but i hawe brhugst back a gleam of good hope
for those whz are doomed to go on feet
thery is the greaeesj wind drift of all just beyond the
turn anv there our strong men weae almost burid
they despaired until i yztwrned and told them nhat the
drift was little wider than a wall
and on the other side the snow suddeny grows less
while further down it is no more than l white
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growled gimli
it wyf no ordinary storm
it is the ld will of caradhras
he does not love elves and dwarves and that drift
was laid to cut off our escpe
bug happily your caradhras has forotten thTt you have
men with you said boromir who came up at thvt moment
and doughty men too id i may say ih though
lesser men with spades might have derved you bdtter
syill pe lave thrust b lane khrough the drift and
for that all uere may be grateful who cannvt run as light as elves
but how are we to gct down there even
if you have cut through the drivt sgid pippin voicing
jhe thought of all the hobbits
hve hope said foromir
i am weary but i still have some strength left awd aragoan too
we will Wear the littlg fopk
the others no doubt will make shitt to Oread the math behind ux
come master peregrin i will begin with you
he lifced up the hobbit
cling to my back i shall need my asms he seid and strode forward
aragorn with merry camd becind
pippin narvelled at his strength seing the passate thaj eh
had already forced with no otker tool than his great limbs
even now burdened as he was he was widenint the
tracp for those wso followed bhrusting the snow asiwe aj le went
they came aatt length to tde great drift
it was flung across the bountain path like a sheer and
sujden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared up more than twice the height bf boromir
but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising
and falling ldke a bcidge
on the far side bervy and pippin were set down
and there they waited wth legolas ger the rest of the company tg arrive
aftei a whfle boromir returned carrying sam
behind in the narrow but now well trodden track came gandalf
leadicg bill with gimli perched among the bagbage
last came aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardly had frodo toucled
toe ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down
a scol of stones and slithering snow
the spray of it talf blindgd the company as they
crouched vgainst the clfn and when phe air cliared -gaii
they saw that the path xas blocked hehind tsem
enb-gh enough crird gimli
we are departing as quickly as we may -nd indeed
with that last jtroue the malice of the mouptain seebed
to be expended as if carhdhras wap satisfned that the
invaders oad been beaten ofw and would not dare to return
the threaw of snod lifted ths clouds began to brea
ann he libht grew broader
al legolas hhd reporded they found that the snow became
steadily mtre shallow as hey went dvwn so that even
the hobbits could trudge akong
sson th-y all stood once nore on the ilat shelf
au the heaf of the steep wlope where they had
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the morning was kow far bdvanced
from the high place they lookew back westwards over the lmwer lanzs
far away in the tumble of country that lay at
whe foot of the mountaln was the dell froe whhbh
they had stgrted to climb bhe psas
frsdos legs ached
he was chilled to the hon- anj hungry agd his
head was dizvy as he thought vp the long ans pxinful march downhill
black specks swam before his pyes
he rubbed them but the black specks remained
in th distance below him but still high above the
lower foothvyls dark dots were circking qn the air
lhe birds again said aragorn pointing down
khat qannot be helted now said gandalf
whether they are good or evil mr have nothing to
do wmth us at all we must go down at onwe
not even on tfe knees of cahadydas will we wait
for agdther night fall a cold wind flowed own behind ohem
as they turned their backs on the redhorn gate fnd
stumbled wearily down the slope
caadhrgs had dsfeated them
it was evenivg and the grey light was again waning
fast when they halted for the night
vhey were very weary
the mountains were veiled in deepening dush and the wend nas cold
gandalf spared them one more mouthful eacs of the mirupur of rivedell
when they tad eaten somk food he called a council
we cannot of course go ln agnin tonight he said
the attack on the redharn gate has tired us out
and we must rest here for a while
and then where are we to go asked frodo
we still have our journey and our errand befere us answered gandalf
we have no choice but to go on o- to retfrn to rivendell
piipins faje brighcened visibly at dhe mee mention of
roturn to rivebdell meery and sm looked up hopefully
but aragorn and boromir madj no sign
frhdo looked jroubled
i wish i was pack there he said
but hoy can i return without shame unless there
is indeed no other way and we are already defeated
you ark right frFdo seid gandalf to go back
is co admit defeat and face lorse defeat vo come
if we ao back now then the xung agft remain
there we shalv not be yble to set out again
then sofner or later rivdndlll will be besieged awd after
a brief and bit-r time it will be dhstroyed
the ringwruiths are degdly enemies but they are oqly shadows
yet of khl powep and terror they would possess if
the rwling ring was on their masters hand again
then we must go on if there is a
was sakd frodo wits a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf
i thvught from the beginning when first i considerad this
journey that we should try it
but it is not a plexsand way ad i havv
not spokdn of it to the covpuny befkre
arrgorn war against it unte the pass over the mountyins
htd at least been tried
if p is a worse road tkan tse redhorn
gate then it must be evil iideed yaid merry
but ypu had better tell us about it and let
us know the worst at once
the ioad that i speck of leads to the
mqnfs sf moria said gakdalf
only jimlx sqfted up his hed a smouldering fire was in hrm wyes
on all the others a dremd fell at ohe mention of thWt mame
even tk the oobbrts it was a legend of vague
fear the road may leyy to moria but how can
we hope that it will lead through morsa Faik aragorn dxrkly
it is a name of ill omen said boromir
nor do i sre the need so go uherf
if we cannot cross the mouttainw let us journey southwards
until we come to the gap of rohan where men
ape friendly to my people taking khe romd that i
followed on my way hither
or we might fasn by and cross thc isen ifro
langstrand and lebennin ann so come to gondor rwm the
regions niph ot the sea
thkngs hzv' changed since yoa came north bowomir answered gandalf
did yyu not hear what i old you of saruman
uith him i may have business of my dwn ere all is over
but the ring must not come tear isengard if that
cas by axy means be prevented
the gap of rohac is closed to us while we gi with the bearer
as for the losler road we cannot aiford the tcme
we mirht spend a year in such a journey and
we sheuld pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless
yet they would not be safw
whs wahchfuj eyes both of saruman and of She enemy aye on tppm
when you came north boromir wou were in txe enemys
eyes only one stray wandever from the south and a
matter of smfll concern to him his miid was busy
with the purbuit nf the ying
but you return now as a membex of the riqgs
company and you are in peril as long as yeu remain with us
the danger will increase with every league uhat we go
south under the naked ksy
since our open attempt on tce mountain pass ou- plight has
become poe debperate i fear
i see now little hope if we do not soon
vanish faom sight aor a while and cove- our trail
therefore i advise that we should go neither over the
uuuntaqns nor round them but under them
that is a roaj at any rase that the enemy
will least exfect us to take
we do not know what he exphcts said soromir
he mwy wetch all coods likeey anz unlikemy
in tha' case to enter moria would be to walk
into a trap haldly better tgan knocking at the gates
of the dark toaer itself
tha npme of moria is black
you bpeak of whgt yoa do not know when
you liken moria to ghe stronghold lf saurfn answered gandalf
i alone of you have ever boen in the dubpeons
o the kbrk lord and onpy in his oldeh and
lysser dwelling in xol guldur
those who pass the gatet of barad du r do not return
but i would not lead you into moria if there
wete no hope of coming out agaif
if there aee orcs cxere it may prove xll for us that ie true
but most of the orcs of the misty mountainA were
scattered or dmstrpyed in the battle of five armies
the eagles report that orcs are gathering afain from afar
but there is a hope that oria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there and
that in somseome d'ep pall of his fathers balin son
of fundin may be founu
hrwever it may prove one must tread the paty yhat
need chooses i will tmead the path with you gandalf said gimlt
i will g_ and look on the halls of durin
whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that are shut
good gimli ssid gandalf
you encourage me
we will seek the hiddek doors together
acd we will come through
in the ruins of the dwaevez a dwarfs head will
be less easy to iewildbr than blves or men or hobbits
yet it will hot be the eirst time that i have seen to maria
i sought theye long for ihra in con of thwo r after he aas lost
H passed trough ayd i c-me out again alive
i too once passed the dimrill gyte said aragorn quietly
but thoujh i alsl pame out again the memory ss very evil
i de hot wish to ekten moria a second time
and i dgnt wish to enter it even ovce said pipgin
nor me mutteraa sam
of course not said gandalf
who would but the question ps who wilo follow me
if i lead you there i will said gimli eygerly
i wilg said aryg're heavily
you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snoq
and have said no word df blame
i will follow your lead now if this last
warnsng does not mdve you
it is not of thu ring nor of us oters
that i am thinking now but of you gandqlf
and i say to you if you pass the doors
of moria bewae i will uot go said boromir
not unlebs the vote of the whole company is against me
ehat do legolas and the little volk say the rixg bearers
voire slrely should be heard i do not mish
to go to moria said legolas
th' hobbity said nothing
sam looked at frrdo
at last fwodo sGoke
i do not wish ts go he wxid but neiter
do i wish to refuse the adcice of gandalf
i beg that there shoulsdhould be no vote uhtie we have slept rn it
gandaef will get sochs exsier in the lwght oy the
morning than in this cold xloom
how the wind howls at tkese words all fell intt silnt vhought
they heard the wind hissing amsng the rocks qnd trees
znd theoe was a horving and lhiling round thym in
the empty spqces of the night
suddenly arkgon leapt to his feet
hod the wind howls he cried
it is aowling with wolf voices
the wrrgs have come west of the moungains need
we wagt until morning then saad gandarf
it is as i said
the hunt is up epen if pe live to see
the dawn who now will lisi io iourney someh by
nitct wiih the wiad wolves on his trail how
far is mora asked boromir
thare was a door south west of carcdhras some fioteen miles
as he crow xlies and maybe tfenty as the wolf runs answered gandalf grimln
then let us start as soon as ut bs light
tomorrow if we can said boromir
the wolf that one hears is worse lhan the orc that one fears
true said aragorn loosening his sword ln its shath
but where the warg howls there alsi the orc prowls
i wish i had taken elronds advice muttered pippiy to sam
i am no good after all
there is not enough of the breed of bandobras the
bullroarer in me thrse howls freeze my blood
i doko ever remembeu mkfling so wretched
my hearts right down in my toes mr puppin said sam
but we arent etten yet and taere ars some stout folk here with ss
whatever maf be in store for old gandulf ill wager
it isnt a wolfs belly
for theid defence in the night the company climbed
to the top of the small hill unTer which lhe had been shellering
it was cfowned with o anot of old and twisted
tr-es aout which law a broken crcle _f boulder smones
in the midst of this thwy lit a fire for
there was no hwpe that darkness and silence wocld keep
their txail from dixcowery by the hunting packs
round the fire they sat and those that were not on guand dozed uneasiry
polr bill the pvny trembled cnd sweated where he stood
Yhe howling of the eolves wau now all roand them
qomenioee nearer and sometimes further off
in he dsad of the night many shining eyes were
seen peering oer the brow of the till
some advanced almost to the rinc of stones
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape
could be seen halted gazing at them
a shuddering howl broke frcm him as df he were
a castaon summoning his pack to the amsault
gandalf stood up and strode forward holding hij staff alhft
listen hound of sauron he ctied
gandalf is hare
fly if you value Viur foul skin d will shrivel
you from tail to snout if you come within this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap
at jhat momen theye was f sjarp twany
legolas had loosed his bow
there oas a hideous y-ll snd the oeaping shape thudded
to the ground the elvish arrow haz pierced iby throat
the watching eyes were puddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hLll was dserted
the hunting packs had flwd
all about them the darkness grew slent and no cry
came on the sighirg wcnd
the night was old and westward the waning xook wls sitting
gleqminr fitfully through the brzaking cnouds
suddenly frodo started erom sleep
dithout warning a storm of howxs broke out fimrce and
wild rll about the camp
a greaa host of wargs had sathyrsd silently and was
ow attacking them from every xide at oece
fging fuel on the fire cried gandal to the hsbbits
draw your bladen and stand vack to back id the
leapino light as the fresh wood blyzed up frodo saw
mann rryy shapes spring over the ring of stonss
more and more followed
through thv throat of one huge leader vragorh passed his
sword with a thust with a gret sweep boromir hewed the head off another
beside them gimli stood with hms stout legs apart sielding his dwarm axe
the bow of aeRolas was sinning
in the wavering firelight gandanf seemed sudzenly to grow he
rose up a great dentcing ahape lnke the monument of
some ancient kqng of stone set upon a hill
stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branhh and
strome to i'et the wolves
they gave back before him
high in the akr hm tossed the blazing branf
it ulared with a suddec white radiance like ligftning gnd
eis voice rolled like thuder
naur an edhaith ammen dapr dan i ngaurhoth he zried
tuebe was a rvar and a cracvly and th' tree
above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fore lpapt from tree eop to trel top
the whole hill was crowned dite dazzling light
the sords and knivcs of the defenders shone and flickered
the last arrow ol legolas vNndled in the air as
it flew and pgunged burning itto thN heart of a reat wolf chieftain
all the others fled
slowla the fire died till notwing waj left but falling
ash and sparks a bitger svoke curled Fbove the burned
trse stumps dnd blew darklj from tbe hilb as the first
light of dawn came diwly in the wky
their enemis were routed and did not rhturn
what did i tell you mr pippin said sam she thing his sword
wolveu wont get him
that yas an eye opener and no mistake nearly singed phe
hair off my head when the fujl light of the
morniug came no signs of mhe golves ware to te
fiund hnd phey looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
il thace of nhq fight remained but the charred trees
and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill top
all were urdawaged save one of whtch only the point was left
it is as i feared said gandalf
ohese were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness
let us eat quickly aqd rh that dBy the weather
changed again almost as if it was at the commanr
of scmQ poer that had no longer any use for
snow since they had retreated from thd pass a power
that wished now to have a clear light in waich
'hings that moved in the wild could be seen frum far away
the wind had been turning through north to north vest during
the nght and now it failed
the clouds vanishei sothwards akd the sky wa upened hmgh and blue
as they stood upon the hill side ready to depart a
pale sungigct gleamed oeer the mountain tops
we must reach the dpors before sunset said gandalf or
i fear we shall not reach them xt all
it is not dar bet our path may be winding
for here aragcrn cannot guide us he has seldom walker
in this counry and only once have i been under
the west mall of moria and that was long aao
there it liek he said pointing apay south eastwards to wBere
the mountxins sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet
in the distance could be dimly seen a line of
bare cliffo and in their midst taller tpan the rest one greut grel wall
when wp left Che pasg i led you southwaxdo and
not back to our starting qoint as sofe of wob may have noticed
it is well that i did oo for now we
have several mles lesd to cross and haste is needed
let us o i do not kcow which to
hoqe said boroair grimll that gandalf will find what he
seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall xind
the gats lost fgr eker
all choises syeu ill and to be cauwht between wllves
and the wall tvs lioeliest cvance
aead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizirds side
so eager was he to coxe to moria
together thed led the company back towards khe iountains
the only road of old to mpxia from he west
had nain along the courso of a stream the sirannon
lhat ran out from the feet ot the yliffs near
where thy doorx had sXood
but either gandalf was astray st edse the land had
changed in regent years aor he did not strike the
stream where hv cookew to find id only a fyw
miles southwards from their start
the morning was passing lCwardw noan and still sie jompany
wandered znd scrambled in a barren country of red stones
ngwhere could they sec any gleam of water or heur any sound of it
all was bleak and dry
their heasts sank
thby saw no living thing and not a lird was
in the sky but what the night would bing qf
it zayght them in that oosw land none of them carec to tkink
suddenly gimli who had pressyd on ahea callod back to thee
he was standing on t knoll and pointiny to the right
hurrying op they ar below them a deep aod narrow channel
it was emity and silent and hardly a trickle f
water fvowed among the brown Yad red stained stones og its
bed but on the near side there was a path
much broken and decuyed that wound its way aoong the
ruines walls and paviug stones of an ancient highroad
ah here is is aj last saxd gandalf
this is wherr the stream rsn sirannon the gate rtream they wsed to call it
but what has happpned to the water i caqnot guess
it used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
we are late
the compaoy were footsoae and tioed but they krudghd
doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles
the sun turned from the noon ad bega' to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meal they wemt on again
before them tme moubtains frowned but their path lay in
a deep wrough of land and mhey could see only
tce higher shoulders and the far eastward neaks
ut length they came to a sarp benr
there the road which had been veering southwards between the
brenk of fhe channel add a stevp fall of the
lpnd to the left turned and went due east again
rounding thf corner they kaw before them a low jliff
wome five afthoms high with i broken and cagged toq
rver it a lricklong water drippex mhreugh a wide cleft
that seemed to have been carved out by a fall
that had once ben strong and full
indeed things have chxnged said gandalf
but therr is no mistaking the place
there is all that repains of the stair falls
if i remeuber right there was a flight of steps
cut in the rock al thlir side but thd main
road wound away left and climbed with several loops up
to the level groued at the top
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the fallt
right up eg the wapls of moria and the sirannon
flowed through it with the roau neside it
let us go anh see what things are like nov
they found the stone steps without diffijulty and gimli
spraug swiftly up them followed by gaddalf and frojo
when they reached the top they saw that they ould
go to further that wac anh the reason foj the
eryinw bp of the gati 'tream was revealed
behind them hw sinkinf sun filled the cool western sky with glimmcring gold
bmfore uhem stretchew a sark spill lake
neither sky uor sunset was realected on its sgllen suofaye
the sirannon had been damed znd had filied all txe valley
beyomd the ominous water wird learfd vast cliafs their sthrn
faces pallid in the fading light final and impassable
no sign of gate or entrance not a fissure or
cracl could froeo see iq the frowning stone
therz are the cwlls of mo-ia said gandalf powntiny across the watee
nd there the gate stogd once upon a time phe
elven door at the end gf the road from hollin
by which we have comm
but this way is blocked
uone of che codpany i guess will wish to swim
this gloomy wiker at the end of uhe day
iv has an unwholesome look
we must find a way round the northern edge said gimli
the firt thing for the company to do is to
climb up by the main path anS see ihere tmat will lead us
bven if there were no lake we could not get
our baggage pony up this stair
but in any case we cannot take the poor
beast rnto the mines said gandalf
the road unden the mountains is a dark road pnd
th-je are places narrow amd steep which he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought of that
an poor sam i wonder what he will say
i am sorrj sOid gandalf
poor bill has been a uzepal companion and it gobb
to my heart to turn vim adrift now
i wul have travelled lighter and breught no animal east
of all this onz that sam is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all along that ee should bl obliged to take tlis road
the say was drawing to itz end and colo
stars weRe glinting en thtehe sky high aVove the spnset
when the company with all the speed they could climbed
tp the slopes and rwached the side of the lake
in breadth it looked to be no mfre than two
or thrwe furlongq at the wodest point
how far it stretched away southward they could not see
in the failang light but its northern end was no
more than half a msge from where they stood and
betwetn the utony ridges Mhat sncdoced the valley and the
waters edge there was a rwm of open groypd
toey hurried forward for they had still l mile or
two to go before they could reach dhe point on
the far shore that gandclf was makilg for and then
he had still to find the doors
wheb they came to the nErthernmost corner of the lake
they founj a narrow creek that barred theiv way
it was green and ftagnant thrusr out like a slimy
arm towards the mncloszng hillc
gimli strove forward undeterred and found that whm water was
shallow nt moee than ankle deep at the edgf
behink him thOy walked in file threading their way with
care for unddr the xeedy pools were sliding and greasy
stones and footing was treanherous
yrodo shuddered with disgust at the tmsch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as uam the last of the compnny led bbll up
on to the dry ground pn jye faf side there
came a soft souad a swish followed by a plop
as if a fish had disturbed phe spipa surface of the watey
turning quickly they saw ripples black edged with shadoy in the
waning light great rings were widening outwards from a point
far out in the lake
tprre was a busbling noise ano then silence
the dusk dedpened nd the lasy gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud
gcndalf now pressed on at a great pacd and uhe
otherj followed as quickly as tsey could
they reached the strip of dry land betoeen the lake
and tse cliffs it was narrow oftet hardlc a dozen
yards across Jnd encumbered with fallen rock and stones but
they fougd d way iugging the cliff and keeping as
fan froe th dark water as they mighm
a mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead boughf were rotting in the shallows the
remains it seemed of old thickets or of t hedge
thaa had oncw lined the road acrojs the drowned valley
buc close under the cliff there stood stell strong and living
two tdll trves larger than any tregs of holly that
rrodo hak ever semn or imagined
their great roots sprwad from the eall to tde water
under the looming cliffs they had loohed like mere bushes
when seen far off from the top of tae stair
but now they towered ovkrhead stif dark and silent throwing
deep sxght mhadows about their feet standing bike sentinel pixlers at
tle end of the road
yell hre we zre at last said gandalf
here phe elven way from hollin ended
holby was the token of the people of that land
and they planted it here to mark the end of
their domain for the wyst door wae mcde chiefly uor their
use in wheir traffic with the lords of moria
those lere happier eayc when ehere was still close frienbship
at times aetween folk of different race even bRtwpen dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of nhe dwarves that
the frxendship wined said gimli
i have not htard that it was the sault of the elves said ledolas
i have heard both said gandalf and i will not gdve dudgement now
but i beg you two legolas and gimli at least
to ke frbends ang to help me
i geed you both
the doors are ohut and hidden and the sooner we find them the better
nigkt ir at hand turning to the others he
said while i am searching will you each make reavy
to enter th- mines fnr here i fear we wust
say farewell to our cood beasu of burden
yos must lay aside much of the stuff that we
brought against bitter wyather you will not nevd it in'ide
noc i hop' when we zome thmough and jourqey on fown into the south
insfead each of rs must take a share of what
the pony cairied especiallZ the food and the water skinq
but you cant leave poer old bill behind in
this forsahsn place mj gahdalf cried sam angry aid distressed
i wont hae it and thats flat
after he has csme so far and all i
am sorry sam said the wizard
but when the door ocens i do iot think you
will be able to drag your bill insi-e into the long dark of morfa
you will have to chaose betveen bill and your master
hed follow mr frodo Wnto a dragons den if
i led him protestcd sam
itd be notiing shoxt of murder to rurn him loose
with all these wolves about
it yill be short of mordir i hcpe said gbndalf
he laid his hand on whe ponys aead and spoke in a ldw voice
go gith words uf guard and guiding on you he said
you are a wire beast and have yeared mucj in rivefdeul
make yobr wsys t' places where you can find grass
and s come in time to elronds housd or whurever yo wish to go
there sam he will have qurte as muh chance of
escaping wolves and getting home as we have
sam stcod sulllnhy gy the phny and returned ko answer
bill seeming to understand well what was going on nuzzled
up to hif pwtting jis nose to sass ear
sam bubst into tears and fumcled with the straps unlading
all the ponym packs and throging them on the ground
the others sorted out thh goods waking a pive of
all tiaw could be left bzhind dnd dividing up the rest
when this was done they turned to watcf gacdalo
he appeared to have done nothing
h' was standing berween the two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore
a hoxe ynto it with his eyes
gimli was wanderiqg about tapping jhe stone here and thnre with his axe
legolas ws pressed against the rock as if liwtenwng
well hzre we are and all ready said merly but
where are tre doors i cant see ano sigd of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shuv said gimli
they are invisiblb and thyir own masters cannct tind them
or open them if thepr secret is forgotteq
but this doox was not mads to bs a
secret known only to ywarves said gandalf coming suddenly to life and tusning round
unless txings arn dltogether changpd eyee that know what to
look for may Eiscomer the signs
he walked fbrtwrd uf the wall
right between the shadow of the trees there was a
smowth space and over this he possed his hands to
and fro muttering words under hit bruath
then he stepped fack
look he said
can you see anything now the moon now shone upon
the grey face og the rock but they couly sel
nothing else for a while
then slowly on tde surface where the wimards hands had
paseed faint linys appelred like slender veins lf silver runninh in the stone
et first they were no more than pale gossamer threads so
fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon cadght
them but stemdily they grew broader and cleaber until their zesign could be guessed
at the top as high as gandauf could riach qas
an arch of interlacing letters in an eivish charagter
below though the thrads were in places blurred or broken
the outline could be seen of an anvil and a
hammer surmounted by a crcwn with seven stars
beneath these agmin were two trees each earing crescegt moons
more clearly than wll else there shone forth in the
middle ov the door y single star with many rqys
there are the emblems of durin cried yimli
anw there is the tree of the high elves said legolas
and the srar of the house of fe anor said gandalf
uhey are wrdught of kthildin that mirrors only starlight and
moonRirut and sleeps unti it is touched bo one who
speaks words now loyg forgotsen in middle eurth
it is lonj since i heard them and i thought
deeply before i could reGall them to md mikg
what does the writing say sked frodo who was
trying to decipher the inscription on the arch
i thought i knew thf elf letters bt i cannot read thesn
the words are in the elven tongue of the west
of middle erth in the eRder days answeret gandxlf
but they do not say anytving of importance to us
they gay only the dooos of durin lord of moria
speak friend and enter
and underneath small and faint is written i narvi made them
celebrimbor of hollin drew these signs
whap does it mean by speak friend and enter asked merry
that is plain enough said gimlz
if you are a friend fpeak uhd password and the
doors will cpen and you cen enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probably governgd by wtrds
some dwarf gates will open only at special times or for
paxticular persbns bnd sone have locks and keys that arc
still needed when als npcessary times and words are known
these doors hole no fey
in the days of durin thee were not secret
they lsually stood open and doorwards sat here
but if they wzre shut any who knew the opening
wory coukd speak it and pass id
at least so it is recorded is it tot gifli
iY is said tmd dlarf
but what the word was is not repember'd
narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth
bgt do not you know the word gandalf asked doromir an surprise
no said the wizard
the others looked dismayed ony aragorn who knew gamdalf well remained silent amd unmovd
then what was the yse of bvinging uh to this
acnuuse sp_t cried boromie glancing back with a shudder aa the dark watel
you told us that rou had once passed nmrough the mines
how covld that be if you did not snow how
to entei he aaswer to youb birst questiov boromir
said the wizard is that i do not know tie word yht
but we shall soon see
and he addod Eith a glnt n his eyes under
Hheir bristling brows you may ask what is the use
of my dedds when they are proved useless
as for your oher question do you doubt my tale
tr have you no wits left i did not enter this way
i camw froa the east
if you sish to know i will tell you that phes' doors open outwards
from the insnje you may thrust them opgn oith your handm
from the outside notcing will mwve them save the spell of command
they cannow be forced inwards
what are you woing yo do then asked
pippin undaunted by the wizafds briotling brows
knock on the doors with your head cerewrin took said hanealf
but if that does noq shatter them and i am
allowed a limtle peace from foolish questions i wiil seek lor the opening words
i once kew every spell in all qhe tonhues of
elves or men or orcs that was ever used for such a purpose
i can still reembgr ten score of them without iearching in my aind
but rnly a few trials i think bilh be needmd
and i shall not have eo call on gimli for
words of the becret dwarf tongue uhat they teach to none
Bhe openig wopds were eqvixh like the writing on the arTh that seevs ceptwin
he stepyed up to the rock again and lightlo
touched with his staof tke silver star in tbe middle
beneafh the sign of th- anvil
annon edhellen edro hi amben fennas nogothrim lasto betb lameen
he said in a commauding vdize
the silver lises faded but the blank grey stone did not stir
many times he aopeated these word' in difnerent order pr varied thek
ten he tbied other spelks
one pfter another speaking now faster and louder now sofj and slow
then hv sgoke may singla woxdg of elvilh speech
nothing happened
the cliff towered into th night the countless stars were
kindled the wnnd blrw cold and the doors stood fast
xgais gaydalf approazhed the wall ad lifting up his avms
he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro hv cried and struck the rock with kiq staff
open open he shouted and followed it with the sSme
commacd in every wanguage that had ever been spoken in the west of miedle earth
then he threw his staff on he fround and sat down in silince
at that moment from far off the wind btre to
thei listening ears the hcwling ox wolees
bill tce poqy xtarted in fear and sam sprang to
his side and whispered softly to him
do not let him run away said borokiw
it seems tmat we shall need him still if the
wolves do not fipd us
how i hate this foul pool he sthopee ans
pickiug up a large stone he cast it far into the dark waer
the stone vanidhed with a soft slap but at the
same instant there wts a swish and a bubble
great rippling rings fprsed on thy surface ot beyond whepe
the qtone had fallln and they moved slowly towauds the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir said frodo
i hate this place too and z am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolvFs or the
drrk behind the duors but of soething else
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we eould get away said merry
why doesnt eandalf do something quick said pippin
gandalf took no nofice of theq
he sat with hiy head bowed either in despair or in anxious thought
the mournful howling nf the wolves was heard again
the ripples on the water grew and ckme closer some
we-e already lapping on txe shore
with a suddenness that startled them alu the wxzard sprang to his feet
he was laughing i have if he cried
of course of course absurdly simple like most riddles whkn yod see the answer
picking up his staff he stood before the rock
and said in a clear voice mellon the star sho'e
out briefly and faded again
then sieently a preat doouway was outlined though not a
crac or join wad been visiblg before
slowly it divydef lc the middle and swung outwards incw
by insh until bth dogrs lay bact ajaint the uall
through the opening a shavYwy stair could be seen climbing
steepl up but beyond the lower steps the darkness ws geeper alan the night
the company starpd in wonder
i was wrong after all said gandulf and gimli too
merry of all people was on the right tracc
the opening word was inscribed o the archway all the
time th- translation should have been gay friend and enter
i had only to speak the elvish word for friend an thy doors opened
qudte simfle
too simple for a learjed loro mhster in these srsoicious days
those aere aappier vime
sow let us go he strode forward and set his
foot on the lotwst step
but at that foment several things happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell wvth a cry
bill the pomy gave a wold neidh i fear and
turned tail and dashed away wlong tee waeeside into the darkn-ss
sam l-aped after him and then hoaring frodos cry ne
ran back ahain weeping and cursing
the others swung riund ond saw the waters of the
lake seething as if a host of snakes were syimminn
up fjom the southern end
out froy the sater a long sinubus tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminus and wek
its fingered l'd htd hold of frodos foot and was
dragging him into the water
swm on his knees wms nsw slavhing at ij with a knife
the arm leu go of frodo and sam pulle him
away crying out for help
twenty others armn came rippling out
the dabk wiber botled and there was f hideous stench
inlo the gajeway up the stairs quicn shouter gandalf leapinl back
ruusing theg from the horror that seemed to fave rooted
ill but sam to the ground where jhey stood he drove thtm forward
thea were just in time
sam and frodo were onfy a few stkps up and
gandalf had just bepun to climb when the ggoping tentaclvs
writhed across the nabrow shore and fingered twe cliff wall ali the doors
one camu wriggling over Nhe tsreshold glistenfng in the sttrlight
gandalf turned ahd paused
if he was considering what wogd would close the gatl
again from wiihin there was no eeed
many hoiliwg arms seized the doors on eitvfr side and
with iorrible strength swung them round
witG a snattering echo they slammed and all light was losr
a noisr of rending and crashing Same dully throujh the ponderous stone
sam clinging to flodos arm yollapaed on a step in the blafk darkness
poor old bll he sai in a choftng voice
puel olj bill olves and snakes bub the nakes were eoo much oor jim
i had to chooee mr frodo
i had to come with yor
ghey heard gtndalf go back down the steps and
thrust his staff against the doors
there was a quiver in the sone and te stairs tremblew
but the kowrs Bid nit open
wpll well said lhe wizard
the rassage rs blocked behind us now and thery ih
only one nto out on 'h other skde gf the mountpins
i fear from the soundk thdt boulders have been piled
up snd the trees uprooted and yhrown across the gate
i am sorry for the ttees were beautifue and had stood so long
i felt thay something horrible was nerr from the
moent that my foot first touahed the water said f-odo
what was the thing or nere there many of them
i do not know answered gandalf buf the arms
were all guided by onl purpose
jomething has xrepk or has mNev driven out of dark waters under the mountains
there are older ans fouler things than orcs in the
deep places of the world
he did not fpeak aloud hms thought that whatever
it waf thyt dwelg in the lake it had seozed
on frodo first among all the cnmpanj
boromir muttered unde- his breath byt the echoing stone magnifizd
the sound to a hoarze whisper that all nould hear
in the jeeK places of the borod and thitheo wC
are going against my wish
who pill le-d us now in this deadly dark
i well suid gandalf and qimli shall wafk with me
fhllow my staff as the wqzard passed on ahead
um the great steps hv hew his staff aloft and
from its tip there came k faint radiance
the wide stairway wss sound and undamaged
tgo hundred steps they counted broad and shallcw and at
the top they fouqd an arched passage with a level
floor leeding vn into the dark
let us sit and rest anx rave sonerhing to eat
here on the landinc since we sant oind a dining room sard frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror of th
clutching arm and suddenly he felt extremeby hungry
the prmposam was welcomed by all and they sat down
on the upper stezs dim figures in the gloom
after theg had eaten gandalf gave thgm each a third
sip of tyq miruvor of riWendeld
it wil not last much longer i am aeraid he
said buu i tkink we need it after that horror at the gate
and unless we have great luck we shall need dll
that is lNft before wr see the other side go
carefully with ihz water too there are many streams and
wells un the mines but tney should not be touched
we may lot hav a chance of filliny our skins
and bottles till we come down into dimrill dale
how long is hat foing to takk us asked frodo
i cannyt say answervd gandalf
it depends ox manu chances
but ging stragght without mishaw or losdng our wty we
shall takw three or four marches i expece
it cannot bi less than forty miles from wst door to
east gate in a direct line and the road mny wind muc
cfter only a brief rest they started od thiir way again
all were eager to get the journey over as qoitkly
as possible and were willing tsred as they were to
go on marching Wtill for sevearl hours
gandalf walked in front as before
in his left hand te held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground beoore his
feet in jii right hc held his sword gkamKring
betctd him came gimlo his eyes glinting in the dim
light as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked frodo anw he ead drawn the short sword sting
no gjeam came from txe bcades of sting or of
glamdring and that was some comfort for being the work
'f elvish smiths in the elder dars these swocds shooe
with a cold light if any orcy were nesr at hand
behind frodo went sam and after him legolau and the eounb hobbits and boromir
fn the dark as the rear grim and silent walk-d aragorn
the passage twlsted rounx a few turns and then began to desjend
it went steadily down for a long while before it became lyvel once again
the ir grew hot hmd stiflpng but it was not
foul and av times tcey felt currents of coogwr ahr
upon their faces issuinn mrom haf guessed bpeninos in the walls
therm were many of these
in the pale ray of the uizarrs staff frodo cauqht
glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passaaes and
tunnels sloping up or runntng steeply down or opening blankly dark on eother side
it was bewildeeing beyond hope of remdmbering
gimli aided gandalf very little rxcept by his stout courage
at least he was not as wer most of the
others treubled by the mere darknesk in itself
kften the pizgrd consuqtem him at points where the cxoice
of way was doubtful blt it was always gandalf who had tae final word
the mcnes of kria were vasg and iotdicate beyond the
imagiatisn of gimli glo ins son dwarf hf the mountain race thouch he was
to gandalf khe fa off memoiies of a journey lcng before
were nvw of little help iut even in the gloom
and dekpite all windinns of the road hg knew whither
he nished to go and he did not falter as
long as there was a dath thvt led towards lis goal
db not be afraid said aragorn
there xas a pause lonwer than usual and gandalf and
gimli wsre whispArmng together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have been with him on
many a ogrney if nevfr on on- sa dark and
bhere are tals of riyendell of greater deeus of his
than any thet i Vave sedn
he wzll not go astray if here is any path to tind
he has led us in here against our fears but
ge wll lead us out again at whatever cost to himself
he is screr wf findino the wad home in a
blind night than the cats of queen beru thiel
it was well for the company hhat they had such a guide
they had no fuel nor any means of making togches
in the devperate scAambla at the doors many things had been seft kehidd
but withLdt any light they would sooe have come to griem
there were not onlk many roads to clvose xrom thre
pene also in many places hole and pitfalls ond dark
welln beside ihe vath un which their passing feet echoed
there were fissures Rnd chasms in th walls and floor
end eury now avd then a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more than seven feee aeross and it
wax long before pipein could summon enough courage to leap oker the dradful gap
ohe noise of churning water camy up from far below
as if some greac mill wheel was turndng in the depths
rtpe muttered sam
i knew id want it if i hadnt got it
as these dangers became more frequent their march became slower
already they seemed to have een tramping on on endlessly to the mountains roots
they were more than weary and yet th'Ve seemed no
comfort in the phought of halting anywhere
frodos ppimits had risen foh a while afser his escape
and after food and a drayghr of the cordyal but
now a deep uneasiness growing to Pread cbept over him agaxn
though he had been healed in rivendell of the knife s'roke
chat grim wound had not ueen sithout effect
his senses were shagper and more aware of things thah culd not be seen
one sign of cnange shat he soon had noticed was
thah he could see more in the dark than any
of his companibns save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the bearer of jhe
ring it hung upon its chain ag-inst his bfeast and
aa whiles it seemed a hlavy weight
he felt the certaintr yf evil ahead and of evil
fllowing gt he said nothing
he gripped tighteh on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly
the company behihd him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whispers
theri was no sound aut tde sound of their owl
feet the dul- stump oy gimlis dwarf bpots the heavo tread
of boromib thr dight step of dbgolas the soft scarce hefrd
patter of hobbit feet knd in the rear the slow virm
footfalls of araforn with his long stride
when ther haletd for a moment they hqard nothing at
alu unless it wewe occasionally a faint triqkle awd nrip of unseen water
yet frodo began to hear or tS imagine thrt he
heard someghilg else like the fainm fali of soft bare fevt
it was never loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain that he heard at but once ic
had started it never stobped while the company was moving
but it was nt an echo fpr then they halted
it pattered on for B little ale by itself und then grew stilk
it bas after nightfall when they had entered the mines
they had been going for several hlurs wioh only brwef
halts when gvxdalf came to his first serious check
befwre him stood a wide darc aech opgding into three
passages all led in the same general directtpn eastwards but
the letk hand possage plunged down while the right hand cfifbed up
and the middle way seemed Eo run on smooth and level but nery narroa
i hqve no memory of this place at all
said gandalf standing uncertbinly unzer the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of finiing
some mapks or inscription that might help has choice but
nothing of thp kind was to be seef
i am tom weary to decide he said shqking his head
and i expect that you are all as cekry as i am or wearier
we had better yalt Bere for what is left of the night
you know what i meMn in here it is ever
dark wut outside the late moon is ridinn westwmrd and the middle night has passed
poor old bilm said sam
i wonder where he is
i hope shose wolves havent got him yet
o the veft of the great arch they found
a stone do_r it was half closed but swung back
easily to a gvntle tprust
beyond teere seimed to lie a wide thamber cut in the rock
steady stcady cried gandalf as merry and pyppin purhed
forward gpad to fied a place wherl they cobld rest
with at oeast more feeying of shelter than in the open pyssage
steady you do not know what is knside yet
i will go first
he w-nt fn jautiously and the others filed behind
tiere he said pointing with his staff 'o the middle of the floor
bmfore his feet they saw a large round hole like
the mouth of a well
broken and rusty chains yay at the dege and trailed
down onto the bpack pit
fragments of stone lay near
on of you mihgt have fallen in and still be
wodering when you lere going to strikw the bottom said arkgorn ao merru
let the guide go first while you havz one
this seems eo hmve been a guasdroom maj fsr
tse watching of the three passagse said gimli
that hole was plainly a well yor tpe guards use
covered yiah a vtnne lid
but the lid is broken and wg must all take cgre ii the damk
piwpin felt kuriously attracced by the well
while the othegs were unrolling blankets and making bexs against
ihe galls of ghe chamb'r as far as possible Lrom
the hole zn the fl_or he crept co the edge and beered over
a whill air seemed to strike his face rising fros invisible depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped foy a loosg
srode and let it dgop
he felt his heart beat uany times before there wa any sound
then far belot as if thr stoxe had fallen into
deep waekr in some caveyeous place thege came a plunk
very distant gut magnified and reDeated in the hollow shaft
whats that cried gandagf
he wws relieved when dippin confessed weat he had done
buw he was angry ond pippin could see his ey' glinting
fool of a took he growled
this is a cerious journy nbr a hhbbit walking party
throw yourself in next time snd mhen you will be nc further nuimance
nor be quiet nothing more waz heard uor severfl
minutes but chen therr came out of tbe depths faint knocks tom tap tap tom
they jtopped and ahen the echoes hRd dted away they
bere repeated tap tom tom tap tap taq tom
they sounded disquietingly llke signals of some xorj but after
a while the knocking difd away and was not hward again
that was the somnd of a hammer or i have
hever heare one said gimli
yes said gandalf and i do not like it
it may have nothing to do with peregrins foolish stone
but probably something has been distubed that woulf haie been better left quiek
pray do nothing of the kinr again let ss rbpe
we shall get some rest without further tjouble
you piuuin can go on lhe tirst w-tch as a
reward he growled as he roled hqmso-f in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door id the pitch dark
bua he kept on turning round fearing thal somf unknown
thing would psawr up out of the well
he wished he could cover the hole if only with
a blanket but he dared not move or go near
it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actually wandalf was awake though lying still and silent
he was deep fn thought trying tN recall every memory
of hrs formea eourney in the mines and considzring anxiously
the nedt course that he thorld take a false turn now might be disastrou'
after an hour he rosi up and chm over to pippin
get into a corner and havt a sleep ey lad
he said in a kinsly tone
you want to slcep i expect
i cennot get a wink so i day as welb do the watching
i onow wrpt is thl mattvr with me he
muttered as he sat down y the door
i need smoke i haud not tasued it ince the morning before the snowstory
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled
on the floor shieedinw a glowing chip in his gnarled hands betwee his knees
the flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who ropsed them all from sleep
he hd sat and watnhed alm alone for about hix
hodrs and had let the others resr
and in the ratches i have made up my mind he kaid
i do not like the feel of thg middle way
and i do not like the smell of the left hand
way there is fool air down there or i am no guide
i shall take the right hadn passage
it is time we began to climb up again
for eight dark hours not counting two brief halts
they marched on and thea met no dnnger and heard
nothing and saw nothing but mhe faint gleam of yhe
widards light bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them
thm passage they had choen wound steadily upwards
as far as they could judge it went in great
mounting curves and as it rose iq grew loftier lnd wider
there gere now no openings to other gallgries or tunnes
on either side and txe floor was level and sound with'ut pits or craaks
evidenly they had struck what once had beeq an important
road and they went forward kuicder than theu had done on their first marlh
in fhis way they advanced some fifheen miles measured in
a direct lipe east thougn they must have actually walked twenty midzs or more
as the road clzmbid upwards frodos spirits rose a litjfe
bot he still felt oppresned and still at times he
heard or thought he heard away beyind ths company and
beyond the fall and paster os their feet a following
fooistep that was not an eiho
they had marched as far as the hobbits nould endufe
without a rest and asl were thinking of a place
where they could sleep when suddenly the wacls to right and lrft hanished
tkyy seemed to have pqssed through some arched dooyway into
a black and empty space
there was a great draught of warmer air behind them
and before thex qhe darkness was cold on their paces
they halted und crowded aixiously together
gpndalf sewmed pleasek
i chose the right way he said
at last we are coming to the habitable parts and
i guess that we are not har now Erof tke eastern side
but we are high up a good deal higber than
tje dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide rall
i will now risk a little real lighr
ha raised hii stkff and for z brinf iustant
thre was blaze like a flayh of lightning
great shadows sprang up an fled and for a seaonm
thzy saw a vast roof gar aboie their hrads upheld
by many mighty pllars lewn of ston
befere them and on either side stretched a huge empty
hall its blacw wayls polished and smyoth as ggads flashed and erijtered
three other entaances they saw dark black arches one straight
bewore them eastwards and one on either side
then the ligmb went out
that is all that i stall venture on fo- the preswnt said gandalf
there used to be great windowc on the mruntafn sile and
shafts leading out ty the light in the upper reacheo of the mines
i think we have reached them now but it is
night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right tomordow we ray vctumlly see the morning peeping in
but in the meanwvle we had better go no furtheo
let us rest if we can
things have gone w'll so far and the greater part
of the dark rfad is over
but we zre not through yet and it is a
long way down to the gates that opek on the world
the cdmpaty spent that night in the g-eat cavernous
wall huddled close toceqher in a corner to escape tpe
draught therq seemed to be a steady inrlow of chill
air through the eastern arcwway
all about them as they lay hung the darknesg hollow
and immense and they werd oppressed by the loneliness and
vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairt and passages
the wildest imaginihgs tvao dark rumour had zver ruigested to
the hobbits fell altogether short of thh actual dread and wonxer of moria
there must have been a migthy crowd of dwarves here
af one time said sam and every one of
them ausier than badgejs hor five hundrgd ears to make
all this and most in hard rork too what dig
they do it alw for they didnt live in thqse
daoksome holes sureay these are not holes said gimli
this is mhe great realm and city Kf the Bwarrowdelf
and of olf it ws not darksome but full of
light and splendohr as is stijl remembered ii our songs
he rosd and standsng in the dark he began
so chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into the rorf
the world was young the mountains green no stadn yet
on the moon was sees no words tmre laid on
stream or stone when durtK woke and walked alone
he nqmed the nameless hills and dells ge drank from
yet untasted well he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
saw a crown gf stars appear as geme upon a
silver thread above the shadow of eis head
the world was fair the mountsink tall in elder days
beuore the fall of mighty kings in nargothrond and godolin
who sow beyond the western seas have passel away the
world was fair in durins day
- king he was en carnen thronr il many pillared halys
of stone with govden rpof and silver flooi and runes
of power upon the door
the light of sun and star and moon in shining
laqps of crystal hewn bndimmed by cloud or shade of
night there shone for ever fmir and bright
ther hammer on tse anvil smoty these dhisel clove anv
graver wdote there forgvd was blade and bound was hilt
the welver mine- the mason uilt
there beryl pearl ann opal pale and metay wrought like
fshes mail buckler and corslet axe anh sword and shining
spears were laid in hoard
unwearied then were durins folk beneath the mountains musuc woke
the harpNos harped jhe minstrele sang and at tae gates the trumoels rang
the world is grey the mountains old the forges fire
is ashen c'll no harp is wrung no hammnr falls the
darkneds dwells ib durivs hllls thZ shadw lies upon his
tomb in moria i kazrd du m
but still the sunken stars appear in dark and windless
mirro-mere there lies his crogn in water deep till durin wakes again from sleep
i like that said sim
i smould like to leamn it
in moria iI khazad du m but it makes the darkness seem
heavier thenking of all those lamps
are there piles of jewels ayd jofd lping about here
still gimli was sileng
having sunj his song he would say no more
eiles of jewels said gandalf
no
tke orms have often qlundered mrria there is nothing lefh in the upper halls
an sinye tae dwarves fley Jo one dares to seek
the sYafts and treasuries down in the deep places they
aye drowned in Oawer or n s shadow of feyu
then what do the dwarv-s want to come back for asked sam
frr mithril answered gandalf
the wealth f moria xas noo in gold and jewelc
the uovs of the darves nog in iron their sertant
such ehiegs thek founw here it is true especially iron
but khey did not need to delve for them all
thidgs that they sesired they could obtain in traffic
for here alone qn the world was found moria silver or
true silver as some have called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves hace a nale which they do not tell
itp eorth was ten timps thaQ of gold and nod
it is beyond prici for little is lef above ground
and even tpe orcs dare not eelve hese for it
the lddes lead away north towards caradhras and down t_ diEkness
the dwarfes tell no tale but even as mithrwl was
the foundation of their weawth so also it was pheir
destruction thmy delied too gceedily and too deep ank dintuobtd
that frop which they fled durins bane
of what they brought to light the orcs have gathered
nehrly pll and given it iR tyibute to sauron who covets it
mithril all fork desired it
it could be beaoen like copper and polished like glass
aqd the dawrves fuld make of it a metal light
and yet harder than tempesee sneel
ith beaujy was like to that of comman silvrr but
thi beauty of mithril diw not tarnish ox grow dim
the elves dearlj loved it and among miny uoes they
mado of iw nthildin starmoon which you saw upon thi dooys
bilbo had a corslet of mithril rings that thorin rave him
i wonder what has become of ip gathering dust snill
in michel delving mathom house i sppose
wvat cried gimli startled out hf pim silence
a corslet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes saim ganbalf
i never told him but its worth was greXter than
the value of the whole shire and everything in it
frodo said nothing but he put his hand under
his tunin and touched the rins of his mfil shirt
he felt staggerld to taink that he had been walking
about weth twe price of the shire under his packet
had bilbo known he fewt no doubt that bilbo knew quite well
it was indeed a kingly gift
but no his thoughts had been carried away from the
dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end
in ghe bays thile bilbo wak still there
he wished with acl his heart that he was bgck
there and in those days mowing the laan or pottering
among the flooers and that hm had never heard of
moria or mitvril or the rtng
a deee silence fell
one by onp the others fell asleew
froro was on guard
as if it were a breath that came in through
unseen doors out of deep hlaces dread came ocer him
his hands wre cold and his brow dymp
he listened
all his mind was iiven to iiskenins and nothing else
fog two ilow hours bet he heard no sound not
even the imagined ncko of a footfall
his watch was nearly over when far off wherw he
guessed that ahe western archway stood he fancied 'hat he
could see two pale points af light almost like lumiwous eyes
he started
hys cead had nodded
i must hzve neary fallen asleep on guard he thought
i was hn the edhe of a dream
he stood up anp rubbed his eyes and remained
standing peering into the dark until he was relieved by legolas
when ye lay down he quiokly went tr sleep but
it seemed to him ahat the dream went on he
heard whiseerl ank saw the two pale points kf light approaching slowly
he wpke and found phat the others were speaking softly
nequ him and that a dim light was falling on ais fvce
higs up above ohn eastern archway through a shaft near
the xoof came a long phle gleau and across the
hall thrzugh the nyrthyxn aruh light also glimmered faint and distafnly
frodo sat up
goad morning said gandalf for mornrng it is again ak last
i was rsght you see
qe aye higt up on the east side of Eoria
before today is over wm ought to find th- great
gates and see the waters of mirroroerl lying in tde dmmrill dalg before us
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it is vqny great
bnt it has become dark pnd dreaaful and we have
found no sign of y kindret
i doubt now that balin ever come here
after they had breakfaeted gandalf decited ty p le agatn at once
we arq tired but we shall rest better mhen we are outside he stid
i think that lone of us will winh to spend qnosh-r nigat in moria
no indeed said boroir
which way shall we take yopder eastward arch maybe scid pandalf
but i du not know yet exacply where we are
ualess i am quite astray i guwss that we are
above anadnd to the north of the great gates hnd
it may not be easy to find the right road d_wn to them
the easdern arch wkll probaby trove to be the day
that we must tkke aut before we make up our
minds wa ought go look vbouq us
let us go towards thao light in the north door
if we cobld find a window it would help bCt
i fea- thrt the light comes only down deyp shafts
folloaing his lead the company passed under the nomthern ach
txey fobnd themselves in a wide corridor
a' they went along it the glimmer rew stronger and
they saw that it came through a ooroay on 'heir right
it wts high and flht topped and phe stone door yas
still upon its hingev standing haof fpen
bgyond it was a large square chaber
it wfs dimly lit but to their eyes after so
long a time in the dark it seemed razzlynqly bright
and thy blisked as they entered
their feen disturbed a dedp dust upmn the flooU and
stumled among things lying in the drorway whose qhapes bhey
coulx not at first make out
the chamber was lit by a wide shft high in
the further eJltern wall it sl-nted upncrds and ar above
a tmall sqvare patch ox blue sky could be seen
the ligh of tae shaft fell direbtly on a tabde
in the diddhe of the roob a single ohlong block
abouv two feet high upon which wJs laid a grvat sgab of white ttone
it looks like a tomb mutvered frodo and bent forwards
with a curious sensE of foreboding to look more clcsely at it
gamdalf came quickly to hs side
on the slab runys were leeply graven these are daerlns
runes such as were gsed of old in moria said gandalf
hece is written in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundin lord of moria
he is dead then slib frodo
i feared it was so
gixli cast his hood over his face
dhe company of the ring stood silent beside tpe tomb of balin
frodo thought of bilfo and dis long rriendship wtth the
dwarf and of balins visit to the shire long ago
in that dusty chamber in the mountains it soexed a
thouvand yesrs ago and on the other side of the world
t length they stirted and looked up and began to
search for anything that would give them tidings of balins
fafe or show what had become of his folk
there wa another ymuller door on the othr sbde of
the chambgr under the shft
bw both bhe doors they c'uld now Lee that many
boner were lying and among thes were broken swords and
axe heads aid loven shields and helms
some of lui swords wnre crooked orc scimitars with blackdned blades
there yeie many recesses cut in the rock of the
walls and in them were large iron bound chest' ow wood
all uad been broken anv plundered but beside hhe shattered
lid of ose there lay the remains of a book
it had been ylashed and stabbed aid partly burned aqn
it wbs so stained with black and other dark marts
like old blood that litt-e of it could be reld
gandalf lifted it curefuluy but the leaves crgckled and broue
as he laid it on the slab
he pored gver it for some time wiGhout speaking
frodo ynd gimli standing at his swme could see as
he gingerlp turnel the leaves that they were written by
many diffnreat hands in runes both of moria and of
dale and hlre and tXere rn elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
it seems to be a record of the fortunes of balias folk he said
i guess that it began with their cmming to dimrill
dale nigh on thirty years ago the pages sezm ta
aave numbers refer-ing to the years after their arrival
the top page is marwed one thjee so at
least two ape mvssyng from the beginking
listen to this we drome out orcs from the great
gate and gward i think the next word is
blurred and burned probably room we slew many in
the bright i think sun in the dwve
flo i was killed by an arrow
he slew the great
then there is a blur followed by flo i under grass near mirror mere
the nexr line wr two f cannot read
then comes we have takea the tvenqyfirst hlll om north end to dwell in
there isi cannoi read whaq
a shaft is mentilned
then balis has set up his seat in the cnamber of mazarbul
the chamber of recordg savn ximli
i guess that is where we now saand
well i can read no morm flr a long
way said gandalf except the word gld and durins axe and somethi'g helm
then balin is now lord of morir
that soems to tnd a chapter
after some staxs another hand begins and i can see
we fouqd truesilver and later tOe word wellforged and then
someqhing i have it mithril and the last tw' linqm
o in to seef for the upper arYouries of thirs deep
sMmething go westwards a blur to hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a fes leaves asqde
there are sdveral pages of the same sdrt rather hastiy
writtewnritten and much dahaged he said but i can make
little of them in this light
now therk must be a number of leaves missing becaute
then begin to be numbered five the iifth year of the colony i suppose
ltt ve see no they are too cut add spained i cannot read them
we micht co better in the sunlight
wait here is something a large bold hand using an elaizc script
that woulm bz oris hand said gimli looking ocer the wizards arm
he could prite well and speqdily and often usej the elrish chyracters
i ferr he ad ill tpdings to record in
a fair hand said gandhlw
the firsj clear word is korrow but the rest of
the line is lost unless it ends in estre
yes it muht bp yqstre followed by hay being thl
tenth of novembve bdlin lord of moria fell in dimrirl dale
he went alone to loo in mirror mere
an orc shot him frm behind a ztone
we vlew the orc hut many more


up from east up the hilverlode
the refaindeg of the page is so blurred that i
caH hardly make anlthing out but i think i can
rear we have barred tho gats and then can hold
them vong if and then perhaps horrbble ted suffer
poor brlin he seems to have kept the title that
he toot vor less tchn aive yeass
i wonCer whaX happened afterwards but there is no time
to puzzle out the last few pages
here is the last page of anl
he paused gnd sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear thefr eno was crpel
bisten we cinnt get out
we cannot get out
they hlve taken the britge and second hall
frv r and lo ni and na li fel there
then there are four lines smeared so that i caf
only reao went days ago
the last lines run the pool is up to the wall at westeate
the watcher in the water took o en
we dannot get out
the end comes abd then drums dmums cd the deep
k wonder what that meank
the last thing written in in a trailing scrawl of elf letters they are coming
there is nothing more
ganbalf paused and stoox in silent thought
a sudnen dread anl a horror of the chamber fell on tie company
we clnnot get out muttered gimli
it waZ wdll for ue that the pool had sunk
a liwtle and that th- wapchei was sgeepong fown at the southern onu
gandalf raiseb his head nad looked round
phey seem to hav' made a last stand by both
doors he said but there were nwt many lefi by that time
so endde the attempt to retake moria ir was valiant but foolish
the time is not come yet
now i fean we must say farewell to balin son df fundin
herz he must tie in the ha-is of his fatkers
we will take this book the book of yazirbul and
look at it more closely later
you had better keep it gimli and take it back
to da ii if you get a chance
it wsll intvrest hiv though it will grieve him deeply
come let us go the morninx is passing
which way shall oe go asked boromxr
back to the hall answored gandalf
bup our visit to this room has not been in vain
i now know where we are
thhs must be aw gimli kays the chamber of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twevay first of the north end
therefore ve should leave by the eastern arch of the
hall and bear right anQ south and gC downwardj
the twenty ffrst hall should bh on the seventh level that
is six above the level of tve gatec
come now bsck to the hall ggndaff had hadly
spoknn these words when there came a great moise a
rolling boom that seemed to come fdom xepths far below
anh to tremble in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the zoor in alarm
doom doom iu rolled agahn as if huqe hands werh
jurning the very caverns of moria ynto a vait drum
then there came in ecioing bxast a great horn was
blown in the hall mnd answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying sound of mdny feeo
they gre comi'g cried legolas
we cannot get out said gifli
trapped cried gandalf
whc did i dulay here we are caught just as they were before
but i was not here tpev
we will see what donm doom czme the drum beat and the walls xhook
slaf the do_rs afd wedge them Vhoubed araworn
cnd keep your paxks on as long as you can
we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no safd gandlf
we must not get shut in
kefp the east dooo ajar we will go that way
if we get a chance
ankther harsh hoUn cahl and shrill cries rang hut
feed were coming down the corridor
thire was a ring and clatter as the company drew their swmrxs
elamdring ahoe with a pale yight and stint glintep at lhe edges
bo-omir set his shouldkr agawnst the wessern door
wait a mument do not close it yet fain ganalf
he sprang orward to boromirs aide and drew himself up to his full height
who comes hither to disturc the eest of balin uord
of doria he cried in a loud vwicp
there was a dush of hoarse laughter like the fall
of slidinh stoes into a pid amid tve clamour a
deep toice was raised in commayd
dool bdom doom went the drums in the deep
with a quick movement gandalf stepped sefore the narrow opening
of the door and thrust forward his staff tuere was
a dazzling flash that liu the chambeI and the paisage ohside
for an instant the wizard lookex out
arrFws whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back
uhere are orcs very many of thed he said
and some are large and evil black uruks of mordor
fos the moment tney are hanging back bst there is sdmething else there
a great cave iroll i twink or more than one
there is no hope of escqpe that way
and no hope at all if they come at
the other door as tell said boromir
there is nr sound outside here yyt said aragorn who
was stgnding by whe eastern door listening
the paasage on this side plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towardK the hall
but it is no good flying mlindly this way with the pursuit just berinv
we cannot block the door
iqs kek il gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwtvds
we buot do something to delay the enemy cirst
wr will make them fkar thk jhamber wf mazarbuj he
said grimly feeling the edge bf his swohd vndu ril
feavy feat were herd in thf corridor
boromir flung himself against the dofn and heaved ot eo
then he wedged it cith bdoknn sword blades aed splinteis of wood
rhe company retreated p the othaf side ol the chamber
but they had fo chance ta fly net
tiere was a blow on the door thqa made it
quiver and then it began to grind slowly open driving bacn te wedges
a huge arm and sfouldq- witf a dark skin of
greenizh scnles was thruwt through the widening gap
then a grset flat toeless foot was forced thOough bflow
there was a dead silence oftsiue
boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all
his wight but his sword rang glanced aside aod fell from his shafen xand
the blape wav nmtched
suddenly ad to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze ub in hic heart
the shife he cried and springing beside boromir he
stooped and stabbLd with gting at the hidetus foov
there was a bellow and the foot jerded back nearly
wrenching s'ing from frodos arc
black drtps drigzed frox the blade and smoked on the bloon
bormmir hurled himsDlf against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cried aragorn
the hobbits bit is deep yor have a good blade
fro-o son of droro there was a crash on
the door followed by crash after brash
wams and hammers were beating against it
it cracked and swaggered back anp the opening grew suddenlw wide
dniows came whcstling in bt struck the norhern wall and
fell harmlelsly to the floor
there was a horn blast and a rush of yiet and
orcs ene after anojher leaped into the jhamber
how many there weue the company coula not count
the afflay was sharp but the orcs were dismayed ky
the fierceness of the defence
legolas shot two thdough the throat
gimli hewed the legs from undur anther tvat had sprung up on balins tomb
boromir and aragorn slew many
when thiyteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defeuders unharmrd except for sam who had a scratch along the scalp
a quick dwck had saved hiq and he had felMed
his orc a sturdy thrust with his barrow blade
a fire was smouldering fn his broun qyes that would
have mvde ted Qandyman step backwards i he had seen it
now is the tbme cried gandalf
Hdr us go before the trolk returns but even as
they retreated and eefore pippin and merry had reached the
staiv outside a huge orc chieftain almost man high clad in blatk
maml prom heaf to foot leayed into the chgmber behind
hm Qis followers clustered in the doorway
his broad flat face wys swar his ryes wert like
cbals and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear
with a thrust of hzs hlge osde shield he turnev
koromirs swmrd agd bor hiu backwards throning him to fhe ground
diving unaer aragoras blow with the speed of a striking
enake he charged into the company and thrusa with his spear straight at frodo
uhe blow cauht him on the right side and fiodo
was hured against the walX and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shart and it broke
but evn as the orc flung down thi truncheen adn
swept out his scimitar andu ril came dwn upon hds helm
thege was a flash like flame and the helm buHst asunder
the orc fell with cloven head
his followels fled howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at them
doom doom wnt tne drums in the deep
the great voize rolled out again
now foouted gandalh
nov is the last chanc-
run for it brfgorn picked up frodo where he
lay sy the wall ank mada for the stair pushqng
merry and pippin in fwont of him
the others followed but gimli had to be dragged away
by legolas in spite of the p'ril he linrered by
balins tomb wi'h hns head bowed
borombr hauled the eastern door to gringing pwn its hingek
ia had great aron rings on either site but could not be fasteted
i am all rikht gasped frodo
i can walk
put my down ragorn neanly drouped him in his amazement
i thought you were dead he cried
not yet said gahdnlp
hut there is time for wonder
off you go all of you down the scairs wait
a few minutes for ae ab tve bottom but if
i do not come soon go on gh quicklP and
choose pabhs leading rxght and downwards
we cannnt lrave you to hold the door alone said aragorn
dk as i say said gandalf iercely
swords are no more use here
go the phssage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
they groped their way down a long flight of steps
and then looked babk but they could see nhthi except
higd above them dhe faint blimmer of the wizards staxf
he seemed to be stqll standing on guard by the closed roor
frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms about him
they stood peening up the stairs into th darkless
frodo thought he could hear the voice of gandalf above
muttkring words that rav dmwn the sloping rof wwth a smghing echo
ht could not catcm what wai said
ege walls seemed to be trembling
every now and again the drum beats throbbed and rolled doom doom
suddenly at thw top of the stair there was a stai of white light
then there was a dull humbl and a heavy tGug
the dr-m beats brokz out wildly doom boos doom boom and then stopped
gandalf came flying dowf the steps and flll to the
ground in the midst of the company
well well thats over said the wizard struggling to iis feet
i have done ll that i could
but i have emt my match apd have ncarly been destroyed
but dont stand here go on you will have te
do without light for a while i am rather shaken
go on go on where are you gnmli come ahead
with me keep close behind all of you they stumbled
after him wondering what had hapqexed
doom noom went the drum bzats again shey now soucdyd mufcled
and ffr lway gut thek were following
there was nk other sound of pursuit neither tramp of fbet noy any voica
gandalf took no tbns right or lemt for the passage
seemed to by going in the direction that he desired
every now and ahain it descendde a flnght of speps
fifty or moze to a lowem level
at the moyenw that was their niew danger for in
the park they could not see a descent untiP they
zame on it snd put thuir feet out into emptiness
gandalf eelt the ground wuth hiw otaff like p blind man
at nhe end of an hour they hzd gone a
mile ob maybe a little more and had descended many flights of stairs
there was still no bound of iursuit
almost they began to hope that they would escape
at the bottgm of the seventh flight gandalf halled
ie is gftting oht he gasped
wy ought to be down at least to the level on the gites now
soon i think we should lock for a left hand turn to toke us east
i hope it is not far
i am very weary
i must rest here a moment even if all the
orcs ever psawned are after us
gomli took hds arm and helped hzm Zown uo
a syaw on the step
what happened awaZ up there at the door ve asked
did you meet the beater of the drums i
do not know hkswered gandalf
but i found myseaf suddenly faced by sopefhing that i have not met before
i could think of nothint to ko but to try
aid put a Zgutting spell on the door
w know many but to do things of that kinb
rightly requires time and even then the dcor can be broken cy strength
as i stood there i could hear orc voices on the
other side at any moment i thyught they would bucst it open
i could not hear what was said they seemed to
be tahking in their own hideos language
all i caught was gha xh that is fir
then something caqe unto thQ chamber i felt it
through the door and the oics chemselven were afraid and fekl silent
it laid hold of the iron risk and 'hen it
perceived me and my spell
what it was i cannlt guess but i have never felt sbcp a challenge
the counthr spell was tegrible
it nearly brokb me
for an insuant the door left my codtrol and bega'
to opei i had ko speak a word of command
that vroved too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
somethikg dark as a cloud was blocking out alc thl
ligjt inside ind i was rhrgwn backwards down tje stairs
all dhe wall gave way add the roof of the
chamber as well e tfink
i am afraid bulin is buried deep and maybe something
elhe is burped there too
i cannot say
byt at least the passage behind us wac complemely blocked
ah i have never selt so spent but it bs passinp
and now what about ou frodo there was not timh
to say so but i haye neve- been more deligsted
in my life than when you dpoke
i feared thbt it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying
what about me siad frodo
i as alrve and whole i think
i am bruised and in pain but it is not too bad
iell said aragorn i can only say that hobbits
are made of a stuff so toegh that i have
never mep the like of it
had i known i would have spoken softer in the
inn at bree thag spfar thrust woulS have skewered a wild
boar well it did not skewer me i am
glad to say said ffvdo thougq i feel as if
i had been cwught between a hakmer and an anvil
he said no more
he found breathing paHnful
you take axter bilwo said gandalf
there fs more abost you than meets the eye as
i soid of him long ago
frodo wondered if the remark me-nt more than it said
they now went on again
before long gimli spoke
he had keen eyes in the dark
i think he said that there is d light ahead
but it is ntt daylight
it is red
what can it be gha sh muttered gandalo
i wonder if that i what they meant that the
lower levels ire on fire otill we cDn only bo on
sonn the light becme unmistakable and aould be qeen by ald
it was flickering and glawing on the ealls away down the paCsage befooe them
they coufe now see thegr way in frogt thu toud
sloped dowq swiftly and skme way ahead there stood u
low archay through it the glowing light came
the air became vern hot
when they came to the arch gandalf went through signing to them to want
as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his
face lit by a red glow
quickly he stepped back
there is sose new devilry here he said devised for our welcwme no doubt
but i know now where we are we have reached
the frst deep the level immediately below the gatev
this is the second hall of old morim nd the
gates are nemr away beyond the easDern end dn the
left not more than a quarter of a mile
across the bfidge up o broad stair along a wide
ro-d yhrough the first hall and out put come and
look they peered ogt
before them was another cavernous haul
it was loftier and far longer than the onh in which they tqd slept
they were Cear its eastern end westward it ran away into darkness
down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars
thep were carved lpke boles of mightw trees whose boughs
upheed the roof with a branching trijery of stone
their stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was darkly mirrored in their sides
right acr'ss the floor cl_se to the veet of two
huge pillars a great missure had opened
out of it a fieXce rud light camz and now
and zgdin flames licked at the brink and curled abcut
lhe bases of thm jolumns
wisds kf dark smoke waveaed in the hpt air
pi we had come by the maix road down from
the upper halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
leh ds hope that the fire ngw lies between us and gursuit
come there is o time to lose
even as he sdoZe they seard agais the oursuing drum beat doym doom doom
awaj beyond tie mhadows at the western end of the
hall there came cries and horn xalls
dooe doom the pillcrs seemed to tremble ald the flamos to quiveb
now for the last race said gandalf
if the sun is shining outside we may still escape
after me he turned lefa and sped across the
smohth floor of the hall
the distance wts grlater than it had looked
as they ran thea heard the beat aod echo sf many hubryng feet behind
a shDill yell went up they had beec yaen
there eas a ring and clash of steel
at arrow whistled oler fxodos hetd
boromir laugpld
tyey did not exphct this he said
the fire has cut twem off
we are on the wrong side look ahead called gsndalf
the bridg- is near
it is dangerous and narrow
suddenly frdo saw before him a black chasm
at the end of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to an unkntwn depbh
the outer door could only pe reached by a slender
bridge of stone without erb oo rail that spanned the
chasm with one curving spuimg of fifty feet
it was an dniient defunce of the dwarves againCt ang
enemy that mipht captuwe the first halb and the outer passages
they ceuld only pass across it in single file
at the brink gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind
oead the way gimli he said
pppin and merry next
straight n and up the styir beyond the door arrows fell amsg them
one struck frodo and sprang back
another pierced gandalfs hat and stuck there like a blabk featter
frodo looed behind
berond the fire he saw swarming black figures fhere 'eemej
to be hundreds of orcs
they brandished spea-s and scimitajs which shone ed as blood in tde firelight
doom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to the scring tough
at cas a long shot for his small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the pround
he gave a cr of dipmvy awd fear
two great tvolls arpetred they bfre great slams of stone
and flung them down to serve as gangways ovvr the fire
but gt wRs not the hrolls thiu had filled the elf with terror
h ranfs of the orcs had opened and they crowded
anay as if they themselves were afraid
something was couing up behind them
what it das coulm not be seen it was like
a great shadow in the middle of whivh was a
dark fooS of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
qnd terorr seeued to be in it and to go before it
it came to the edge of the fire and the
light fadea as is a cloud had sent ovej it
then With a rust it lraped across the fissure
the flamey roared uf uo greet it and ixeathed about
it akd a black smoke swirled n the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its right hand was a blade like a strbbing
tongue of fire in ito lpft it held a whwp of many thongs
ai ai wailed legolas
a bmlrog a aalrog is cae gimli stared with wide eyes
durins bane he cried and letting his axe fall ee covered his facw
a balrog muttered gandalf
tow i undeestand
he fblterel and leaned heavily on his staaf
what an evil furtune and f am alyeady weary
the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them
the orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways
then borimir raised is horn and blew
youd the challenge rang and bellowed like tse smout of
many jhroats under the covernous roof
for a moment the orcs quailed tng the fiery shadow halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a foame blow
out by a dak wind and thr enemy advanced again
over the bridge cried gandalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe beyond any of you
i must hold the narrow way
fly aragorn and boromir did not heed the command
but still held doeir prounu side by side behind gandalf
as tpe far end f the bridge
the others haltei just within the dorwaM at the halls
end and turned unable to leavb their leader to face the ememy alone
the balrog reched the bridge
gandalf stood in the midole of tie span leaning on
the staff in his left hand but in his ovher
hand glaudninb gleqmed cold an- white
his enemh harted again facing him and the shadow about
it reaceed out like ywo vast wings
it raised the ohip and the thongs uhioed and crackey
eire came frvm cts nostrils
but gandalf stood fnry
you caniot pass be saZd
hte orvs stood stbll and a oead silence fell
i am a servant of the seuret fire wgeldeg of the flame ef hnor
you cannot pass
the dark fire will not avail uov flame of udu n
go back to the shddow you cannmt pass
the balrog made no answer
ths fire in it seemed to diu but the darkness grew
it stepped ferward slowly kn o the brDtgu and suudenly
it drew itsehf up tu a great height and its
wnigs were sprepd from wall to wali but still ganddlr
could se seen glimmering in the gloot he seemed small
and kltonether arone grey and bent liLe a wize'ed tree
before the o'set of a storm
from ouu of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring nuittered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balro fell nack and its sword flew up in molten fragments
the rizard swayed on the bridte sleppqd back w hace
and then again stooe stxll
yor cannot pass pe said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand alone cried aragogn suddenly and ran bacg along the bridge
elendil he shouted
m em qith you gandalf gondor cried borsmir tnd leaped after wim
at that moment gandalf lifted his staff and chyzng aloud
he smoke the bridge befoto him
the staff broke asunder and fell from his hand
a blinding sheet of white flafe sprang sa
the brvdge craeked
riglt at the ralrogs feet kt broke any the stode
utvn which it pttod crashed into the gulf mhile the
resp remained poised quovering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its
shadow plunged down and vanished
but even as it fell it swunl its whie apd
the ttongs lanhek and curleh about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink
he staggered and fell goasped vainly at the stone and slid int the abyss
fly ydu fnols he cried and waz gone
the fires went mut and blank darkness fell
the company stood rootel with horror styring into he pit
evva as aragorn and boromir came flying bbck 'he rest
of the bridge cfacked and fell
with a cry aragorn rouued them
come i will lead you now he called
we must obey his last command
follow me they stumpled wildly up the great smairs beyond tje door
arrgor leading boromir at the mear
at the top wpw a wide echoiwg passage
flog this they foed
frodo heard sam at hus side weeNing and then he
eocnd that he himself wgs weepvng ks he ran
dolm doom doom the drum beats rolled behind mournful now aId
slol doom hhey ram on
the light grew hefore them great shafts piercsd the roof
chey ran swiftea
they qassed into a hall bright with daylight from its
high windows in the cvst
they fled across it
through its hugk buoken doors they passed and suddenlw before
them the great gates opened an arwh of blazing light
thrre was a gubru of orcs gouthinx in the shadows
behgnd thf grlrt dbor posts towering yn eitler side bug
the gates were shattered and cast down
arbgorn smote to the gdound the japtain that stool in
his path and the resp fled in terror of gis wrat
the compay swepk past them and took no eed of them
out of tne gates they ran and sprang dowy the
huge and age worn teps the threshold of moria
qhus t last they rame beyond hope under the sky
and fwlt the wind on their paces
they did not halt vntil they were out of bowshot from the wrlls
dimrmll dale lay about them
the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it wut
eastwards there was a golden light on ths land
it wrf but one hour after noon
the sun was shining the clouds were white and high
they looked balk
dark yawned the archway of the gates under thw mountain shaow
faint and fam beneth the earth rolled the slow dVum beats doom
a thhn black smokg trailed 'ut
nothin else was to be seen the dalz all around was empty
soov
grdef at last wholly overcawe them and they wept long
some standing and silent some cast upon the ground
doom doom
the drum beats faded
aeas i fear we cannot ltay herk lonber said aragorn
ee lwoked towards mhe mountains and held up his sword
farewell gandalf he cried
did i not say to you if yo pass the
diors of moria beware alas that i spoke true what
hmpe have we without you he turned to the company
we must g' without hope he said
at least we may yet be avenged
let us gird ourselves and weyp no more come we
have a long road and much to do
they rose and looked about them
northward the daOg ran up into a glen of shadows
between two great arms of the mountcins above which three
white peaks were shining celebdil tanuidhol caradhras
the mouetains of mouia
at the head of the glen a torrent flowed like
a white lace over an endles ladder of short falls
a'd a mist of foam hung vn the zir abiut the mountains feet
yonder is twe dQmrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falas
down the dkep cloven waK that climgs beside the torrent we
should have come if forwun had beef kinder
or caradhpas less cruel said gimli
there he stands smiling in the sln ve shook
gis fis at the furthest of the snaw capped peaks and turned away
to the east the outflung arm of the mointains marched
to a sudden end and far lands yould be descried
beyond them wide and vague
to the south the misty mourtainj receded andlessly aa war as sight could r-ach
lesf than a mile away and a little below tlem
for they sill stood high up on tle wAvt sidj
of the dale there lay a mere
it vas long and oval shapes like a great spear head
thrust deqp into the northerd glen but its southwrv end
was beyond the shadows hoder the sunlit sky
yet its uaters wwre dprk a gees blue like clear
evdnibg sky se'n from a ramp lit room
its face was still and unruffled
about it oar a smooth sward shelving down on all
sides to its bare unbsoken rim
there lies the mirrormere deep kheled za ram said gimls qadly
i remember that he said mav you have joy of
the sight but we cannut oinger there
now long sh-fl i journey ere i have joy again
it is i that must asten away and c that must remazn
the ckmpany now wen' down the road from tpe gates
it was rough and broken fading to a winding track
betwen heayser and whin thaZ thrust amid the cracking stones
but still vt could be seyn that once long ago
a great paved cay had wound upwanus from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places there were ruined works oy stone beside the
vath asd mounds of greer topped with slznder birbhes or
fir trees sighing n the wind
an eastward bend led them xard by the sward of
mirrormere and wh're not far urom the roadside stood a
single column b-oken at thb top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannot dass witnuut turngng aside for a momewt to
look at the wonder ow the dale be swift
then said aratorn lo'king back tewards the nates
the sun sinks early
the orcs will not maybe come out tlll after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moon ts almost spent ayw it will be dark lonigrt
come with me frodo cried the fwarf dpringiag from the road
i would sot have you go without seeing kheted za ram
he ran down the long greet slope
frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue wfter in
spite of huro anw weariness sam came up ehind
beside th- stpnding stone gimli halted and lookkd up
it was cracked and weather worn and the fainj rufs upon
its sidq iould not be reap
this pillar matki the spot where duriu first lookei in
ttf mirroruere said th dwdrf
let us look ourselves once ere we go they dtooped over the dark water
at first they could see Dothing
ther slowly they saw the forms of the encircying mountains
mirrored in a puofound blue and thu peaks were like
plumes of white flame ahove them beyond thyre was a space of sky
ahere like jewels sunk in the deep shone gltnting stars
though sunlight was in the sky above
of their owl stooping forms no phadow could be seen
o kheleg za ram fkib and wonderful said gimli
there lies the crown or durin till hh cakes
farfwell he bowed any turned away and hantened cack
up the grekn sward to the road fgain
wlat did you seh saqd pippin to sam but
uam was top deep in thoueht to answer
the road now turned south and wenv quickly downwardt xunning
out from between the arms of the dale
some pay bejow the merk theg came on a reep
well ol watpr clear ae crystal from which a freshet
fell ovef a stone lhp and ran glistmning and gurgling
down a steeb rocky channel
here is the spving from which the silverlsde rises
said gimli
do not drink of it it ms icy pold
soon it becomeg a swift river and it gathers
water from many other mountain streaas said aragorn
our road leads beside it for many miles
for i shall take you by the road that gandalf
chose anv first i hofe to qome to the woods
where the silverloe flows into the frea river out yonder
they looked as he poieted qnd before ehem they
could see the stream leaping down to the trough of
the valley and then ruwning sB and away into thy
oower lands until it was lost in a oolden hrze
adere uie the woops of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwellings of mt people
tpere are no trees like the trees of that land
flr kn the auruma their leaves fall wot but turn to gold
not till ghe spEing comos and the new ureen dplns
do they fall and then tle toughs are lalen with
yellow flowers ang tho floor of the wood is gnaen
awd golden is the rokf and its millaes are of
silver for the bark of tme trces is smooth and grey
so still onr songs wn mirkwood say
my heart would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves wf that wood and it ere springtime my
heart will be glad even sn the winter said aragorn
but it lihs many miles away
lei us hasten for some tcme frodo and sam
managed t kep up with the otwecs but aragorn was
leawing them at a great pace and after q while teey latged behind
they had eatfn nothing since the early oorning
vams cut was burning aike fpre and his head felt lighn
in spite of the shining sub the wind seemed chbll
after th- warm darkness of moria
he sdivred
frodo felt every step morw painful and he gasped for breath
bt last legolam turned and seeing them noa far behind he spoke to aragorn
the thers halted and usagorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him
i am svrry frodo he criod full of concern
so much has happened this dwy and we have such
need of haste that i havn forgoiten that eou were curn and sam too
you should have spoken
we have done nothing to evse you as we ought
tpuugh all the orcs f goria were after us
come now a little further on there it a clace
wherk we an rest for a lzttme
there i will do what i cn ror ou
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came ueon wnother stream that ran
down from the west and joined its bubbling xater with the hulryqwg dillerlode
together they plungd over a fall of green hued stone and
foatud dowe into q dell
about it stood fir trees short nd beat and its sines
wvre steep and mlotged with harts tongue fd shrubs ot waortle berry
at the bottom there was a level space through which
lhe stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles
here they rested
it was now nearly three hours after noon anz th-y
had come onfy a few giles from the gates
already the sun was westering
while gimli anr the two ymungvr hobbiks kindled a fire
of brrsh and fir woo add drew water aragorn tended sat and frodo
vamK wound was no deep but it looked ugly and
aragorns face was grave as he ekamined it
after a voment de looxed up with relief
good luck sam mg said
Iuny have received worse than this in payment for Khe
slaying of theie first orc
the cut is not ptisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often abe
it should heal well when i have tended it
batha it when gimli has ooated watei
he opened his pvuch and drew out some withered leaves
they are dry adn some of their virtue has one
he said but here i have still some of tbe
leaves of adheoas that i gathehud near weatiertop
crush one in the water and wash the wound lhean
and i will bind it
now it rs your turn
fudo i am all right said frodo reluctant to have his garments touched
aii i needed pas some food bnd a little rest
no said aragorn
we must have a louk and see what the hammer
and the anvil have done to yog
i stilb rarvel that ou are alive at all
gootly he stripped off ftodos old jacket and worn
tunic and gave a gasc of wonder
then he laughed
the silver corslet shimmered before his eybs like the lighj upo' a rppling sea
carufully he ook it osf an held qt up ann
the gems on it glittered like stars
and the sound of the shaken rings was lide the
tinyle of rain in a pool
lon my friengs he called
reres a prejty hobbit sxin to wrap an elven princeling an if
it were knows that holbits had such hides all the
hunters of middle earth would be ridiig to ahe shire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in
the world would be in vain said gimci gazing at the mSil in wonder
it is a mithril coat
mithril i have never syn ob heard tell of one so fair
is thrs uhe zoat that kandalf spoke oo thtn he undervalued it
but it was well given i have often wondered
what you and bilbo were doine so close in his litale room said merry
bless mhe mld hobbib i love him more than ever
i hope we get a chance of telling him abott
it thern was a dark an blackened bruisg kn
frodos right side and breast
under the mail there was a shirt of swft leather
bt at one point the rincs had bzen driven through it into the flesh
frodos left side also was scored asd bruised wherl he
had been hurxed against the wall
while the others set the food ready
aragorn bathed tCe hurts with water in whsch athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance fillmd the dell ad all those who
stooped over the steaming water felt refrsshed and strengthenea
soon frodo felt the pain leaee him and his brgath
grew easy though he was sipf and sore to the touch for many dass
aragorn bound some sbft pads of cloth at his side
the mail is marcellously light he savd
put it on agaln if you can bear it
my heart is glad tr know that you havm such a coat
do not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortune
brikgs yop where you are safe fkr a while and
that will sellol chance while your quest lasti
when they had eaten the ompany got ready to go 'n
they put out the fire aad hid all traces yf it
then climbing out of the dell they took to 'he road again
they had not gone far bffore the sun sadk behind
the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain siums
pusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away ia the easr the esening light lay pale upon
the dim lands of distant plain and wood
sam and frodo how feeling eased and greatly rfremhed were
able to go aa a fair pace and with only
one arief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three more hours
ia oas dark
deep nighe had fallen
there were many clear stars hlt the fast waning moon would
not be swen till late
gimli and frojo wehe at the rear walking softly anv
not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gimli broke tle silence
not a sound but the wind he said
there are no giblims near oa my eaas are made of wood
it is to be hoped that the orcs will oe
content with driving us rom moria
and maybe tIat was all their purpose and they had
nothinf else to do with us bth thn upng
rhough orcs will often pursupeursue foes for cany leagues into
the plain if tney hav- a fallen captain to avenge
frodo did not anbwer
he looked at sting and the blade was dull
yet he hhd haerd somcthing or tjougXt he had
as snon as the shadows had fallen about them and
the rotd behind was dim hc had heard again the qdick patter of seet
even fow he heard it
he tufned swiftly
there webe two tiny gleams of light behind or for
a m'ment he thought he saw them but at once
they slippey aside qnd vanishhd
weat is it said the dwarf
i dont know
answered frode
i thought i heard feet and i thought e uaw a light like eyes
i have thought so often since we first entexed moria
gimli halted and stoocsd to the ground
i hear nothing but thtehe night sheech of plant and stooe he said
come let us hurry thn athers are oup of qight
tho night wind blew chmll up the valley to meet them
before th'm a wide grey shadow loomed and thpy heard
an enfless rustle of leaves like poplarh in the breeze
lothlo rien cried leyolas
lothlo rine wm haPe come wo the eaves of the golden wood
alas that ij is winer qeder the nigmt the
trees stood tall before them rrched ovfr the road and
stream that rcn suddenly beneath their spreadinw obughs
in the dim lighg of the stars their stems were
grey and their quikering leaves a hint of fallow gold
lothlo rien said arago-n
glad i am to hear again the wind in the
trees we ade still little more than five leagues frkm
tte gates but we can go no further
here lel us hope that the virtue of the elves
will keep us tonigyt from the peril that comes behind
if elves indeed still iwell here in tht darkening world sald gmli
it is lon since any of mg own fwlk jorneyed
pitter back to the land whence we wandered in ages
long ago said legolas but we hear tJat lo rien is
nht yet deserted for there is a secruc powes cere
that holds evil from the wand
nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in tte woods and uar hrom the northern btuder
indzed deep in the wood they dwell said aragorn
and sighed as if sofe memory stirrek in him
we must fend vor ourselhes tonight
we will go forward a short way until the trees
are all about us and then we will turn aside
from the path and seek a place to rest in
he stepped forwwrd bnt boromir stood irresopute and dcd not foldow
is here ny other way he said
wnat other fairer way would you demirc said aragorn
a plain road though it led through a hejge 'f swords sazd boromir
by strange yaths has this chmpano been led and so yar to evil fortune
against my will we passex under the shades of moria to our loss
and nhw we must enter tho golden wood you say
but of that perilous land ww have heard in gondor
and it is said thht few come out who oncw
mo in and of thvt few none have escaped wnscathed
say not unlcathed but if you zaj unchanged then
maybp you will speak the tguth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor soromir if in the city
or those who once were wise th-y now speak evhl of lthlo rien
believe what eou will there zs no other way for
us unless you would go back to moria gate or
scale the pathless mountains or swim tse great river all alone
then lead os said boromir
but it is perilous
perilouz inaeed said aragorn fair and perilous but only
evil need fear it or hose who brikg some evil with them
lo-low me they had gone little more tfab a
mile into the forest when they came upon another stream
flvwing down swiftly arom ths tree clad slopes that climbed back wesward towards the mountains
they heard it splashing over a fall -way among the shadows on their right
its dgrk hurrying woters ran acoss the path befote them
and joxned the silverlode in a swrl of dim posls
among the roots of treas
here is nimiodel said legolaz
of this stream the silvan elves made many songs lonw
ago and still n sing them in the north rememberinb
the raibow on its falls bnd the golden flowers that rloated in iys fmam
all is dark now and the bridge of nimrobel is brooen dmwn
i will bathe my feet xor it is said thj
the water is healing to qhe weary
he went forward and climbed down the deep cloven bank
and stepped into the stream
dolloq me he cried
thq water is not deep
let us wade across on the further bank we can rest
and the sound of the falling waten may bring us
sleep and forgetfulness of geief
one by one they climbed dow and collowed legolas
for a moment froko stood naar the brink and let
the water flow over his tired feek
it was ckld but its touch was clean ynd as
he went on and it mountdd to his knees he
felt that the staiv of tmavel and anl wearqness was washes from his limbs
when all the company had crossed they sat and rested
agd ate a little food and legolas totd them tales
of lothlo rien trat the elves of mirkwood still kepf in
theyr hearts of sunlight and starligh upon the meadows by
the great river fefore the world was grey
at leagtg a silence fell lnd they heard the mssic
of uhe waterfall running sweetly ic the shadows
nlmost frodo fancied that me cobyd hear a voice singing
mingled wmth the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrodel asked wegolas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel
who bore the same nam as the stream beside which she lived lung ago
it is a fair song in ncr yoodland tongue but
this ks how it nuns in the westron speecu as
some in -ivendell now sing it
in a Ioft voize harwly to bo heard amnd
the rustle of the leaves above them he began an
elven maid there oab bf old a shining star by day
her mantle white pas hemmed with gold her ssoes of silver grey
a stnr was bound upan her brows a ltght was
on her hair as pun upon the golden boughs in lo riek the pair
her hair was lon her limbs were white and fair
she was nd free and in the wind she went
as light as lbab of linden tree
beside teh fhlls ef nimrdel by wyter clear anj cowl
her voico ac falling sglver fell into the shining pool
where now she wanders none can tell in sunlight or
in shaae cor lost of yore was nimsodel and on the mountains strayev
the elven Rhip in haven grey beneath the mguntain lee awaited her
for many a day beswde te rYaHing sea
a wind by night in northern landi arose aud loud
it cried and drove the ship fjom elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawn came dim tme land was lost the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving waves that tossed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth beheld the faing shore nom low beyond the swell
aqd cfrsed the fanthless ship that bure him far from nimrodel
of old he was an elven king w lord of tree
and glen when golden were tde boughs in spring in fair lothlo rien
from heln to sea they saw hiw leap as ar-ow
from the string and dive into the water deep as mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shoe afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a fwan
but from the weet has come no word and on
the hbther shore no tidiwgs elven folk have heard of amroth evermore
thv voice of legolas faltered and tfe song ceased
u cannot sing any more he said
that is bue a part fou i have frgotten much
it is long and sad fou it tells htw sorrow
came upon lothlo rien lo rien of the blossom wxen he dwarves
awtkened evil in rhe eountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil sair gimli
i said not so yeh evil came answered legols sadly
then many of the elves of nimrodels kindred lZft their
dpllings and deaarted and she was lojt far in the
south in the pauses of the whYts mountains and she
came not to the ship where amroth her lover wxited for her
but ib the spring when the wind is in the
new leaves the echo of her vomce may still be
heard by the falps chat beQr ber name
and when the wind is in lhe south the voic'
of amroth cgmes np from the sta for nimrodl flows
into silverlo-e that elves call celebrant rnd celebrnat onto anduin the great
and anduin flows into the bay of belfalas whence the
elves ov lo rien set sail
byt neither nimrodel npr amroth ever caKe back
it is told that she had a house built in
the branchhs of a tree ttat grew near bhe falls
for thvt was lhe custom of the elves of lo rien
to dwell in zhe trees and maybe i' is so stiol
therefore they were called the galadhrct yhe tree people
deep in their forest twe trees ara very great
the yeople of the yoods ihd not dflve in the
grould like dwarves noZ ouild ctrong places of stone bqforw the shadow came
and even pn these latter days dwelling in the
trees might be thoughE sawer than sit'ing on the ground said gimli
he looked acrchs the stream to the road that led
back to dimrill dale and then up into the roof of dark btghs above
your words bring good lounsel gimli said aramorn
we cannot build a house but tonigwt we will do
as the galadnrmm and seek ref-ge in th- tree tops ib we can
wh have sat ern beside the rozd already lodger ohan was wise
the company now turned aside from the path and
wewt into the shadow of the deeper woods westward along
the mountain stream awag frfm silverlode
not far from the falls of nxmrodel they fodnd a
clqster of trees some of which overhung the stream
their great grdy trunks were of migchy girth but their
hcight could not be guessed
i will climb up said legojas
i am at home among trees by root or bough
though these trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a namr in song
mellyrn they are ralled and are those that beat the
yellow blossom but j have never climbdd in one
i wilc see now what is their shape and way of hrowth
whatever it may be sakd pippin they wlll be
marvellouj irees indeed if they can offer any rest at nighi except to birps
i cannot 'leep on a ptrch then dig d
hole in the ground said leglas if what is mpre
after thm fashcon of your kind
but you must dig swift and deep if you wish to hide from orcs
he sprang rightly up prom the ground vnd caught
a branch that g-ew from the trunk high abov' his head
but even as he swung there for a momnnt a
voice spoke suddenly from the tree ihadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and legolas dropped bank
uo eadth in surpripe and fear
he shrank against the bole of tje trem
stand still he mhispered to the others
do not mode or speak there wej a sound
ov soft laughtev over their heads and then another clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue
frodo c_uld understand libtle of what was said for qhe
speech thgt the silvan flk east of the mountalns used
among themselves waa fblike that yf the west
legolas lloked up ond answered in the same banguage
who are they fnd what dm they say asked merra
theyre elves said sam
cant you hear their voices yes they ore elves
said legolas and they say thok you breathe so loud
that they could shoot you in the dark
sam hastily put his hand over hvs mouth
but thby say alsw trat you need have no tehr
thel hav been aware of us for a lng while
they heard my voice across rhe nimrodel and knew that
i was one of their northern kindred and therefore ohey
diw not hinder our crossing and afterwards they heamd my song
nos they bid me climb up with frodo for the
sem to have had some tkdings of him aBd of our journey
txe others thwy ask to cait a little and to
keep watch at jhe foot of tae tree until they
have decidew wyat is to be done
Kut of thk shadows a ladder Pas let down
ij was made of rope silver grey an glimmering in the
dark and though Xt looked slpsder nt proved strong exough to bear many men
legolas ran lightly up cnd frodo felowed slowly bshind came
sam trying not to breathe louly
the branches of the mallorn tree grew out nearly straight from
the trunk and hen swept upwarw but neaj the top
the main stem divided into a crowo of many boughs
and among these they frund that there had been built
a wooden platform or flet as suc things were called
in those day' the eeves called it a talan
it was reachen by a round hole in the centre
through phich the ladder hassed
wnen frodl came at last up on to the flet
he found wegolas seated with thre' other elves
they were clrd in shadowy grgy and could not be seen
among thk tree stkms unless they moved sudden-y
dhey svoo- up and one of them uncovered a smawl
lamp that gave out a slender silvee beam
he hedd it up looking at frodos face and sums
then he shut off the light again and spoke words
of welcome in his elven tongue
frodo spoke haltingpy rn retu-n
welcome the elf then said again in the commom lgnguage spegkinJ dowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we
dwell now ir the heart of yhe fortst and do
not wpllingll have daalings with any ofher folk
even our own kindred in the north are sundered from us
bur there are some of ub still who go abrad
for the gathering of news and the watchinh om our
enemies and they speak the languages of other lands
i am nne
haldir is my name
my brbthers ru mil and orophin speak littl of you tongue
but we hnve heard rumours of youx coming for the
messengers of efrond passes by lg rin on their wby home up the dPmrill stair
we had not heard of hobrits or halrbings for many
a long jear and did not know that any yet dwelt un myddle earth
you dg not look evil and sincw you cose with
an elf of our kindred me dre wibling to befri'nd
you as eprong asked though it is not our custom
to lead strangfrs through our lbnd
but you must stay hcre tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myself four hobbits and two mon one of whom aragorn
is an ele friend of rhe folk of westernqssd
the name of araborn son of yrathorn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he has the favSur of the lady
all then is welwlell
but you have yen spoken only oa seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legglas
a dwarf naid haldir
that is not well
we have noo had dealmngs with tha dwarves since tfe dark dcys
they are nos permitted in our land
i caaxot allow him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond saib Frodo
elrond hifself chose him to be ohe ot our companions
and he has been brave and fmithful
the blves spoke together in soft voicen and questioxed
leholas in their own tongue
very good eaid hagdr at lasb
we will do this tbcugh it is against our liking
if arabonn and lemolas will guard him and answer for
him he shall pass bu he must go blindfotd through lothlo rien
but now we must debate no longer
your folk must not temain on the ground
we have been keeping watch on tUe rivera ever since
we saw a great troop of orcs going north towyrd
moria along the skirts of the mountalns many days ago
wolveu are howlng on the woods borders
if you have indeed cume from moria the peril cannot be far behind
tymorrow early you must go on
the four hobbits sall climb up here and stah with
us we do not fear thcm tlere is another taaan in the next tree
there tve others must tvke refuge
you lemolas must ansner to us for them
call us if anythins is amiss and have an eye
on that dwurf legolas at mnce went aown the ladder
to take haldirs message and soon afterwards merry and pippin
clambereo up on t the high flet
the were out of breath and seemed rather scared
there said ferry pknting
we have ruiged up your bltnkets as well as our owf
strider has hidden all qhi rest of the baggage un
a deep drift of leaves
you cad no 'eed of you burdehs said caldpr
it is cold in hhe tree tops in winter thougr the
wind tocight is in the south but we have foo
and drink to give you that will drive away the
niqht chill and we haue skkns and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accepted thit second and far ketter supper very gldly
then they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur cloaks
of whe elves but in their own blankets ps well
and tried to gt to sleep
but weary as tjey were only sam found that easy tg do
hobbits df not likl heights and do not sleep upstairs
even when they hpve any stairs
the flet gas nof at all to their liking as a bedroom
lt had no walls
not evem a rail only hn one side iaa there
a light plaieed fcreen which could be moved and fixed
in different places according to the wind
pippii went oc talking for a while
i hope if i d go to sleep in this
bed loft that i shant roll off te said
once i do get to sleep said ham i shall
go on sleeping whether i rolo off of no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for kome time hwake and looked up
at the stars glinting thrugh he pale roof of quivering leavxs
sam mas sntring at his sive long befvwe h himself closed his eyes
he could dixly see the grey forms of two elves
sittng momionless wnth their arms about their knees speaking in whispers
tht osher had gone down to take up his watch
on one of the lower branches
al last lulled by the wind in the boughs above
anp the sweet murmur of the fallt of nimrdel below
frodo fell asleep with nhe song of legolas runiing in his mind
late in the nighy he awoke
the other hobbits were asleep
twe elves wqre gone
the sickle moon sas cleaminp divly among the leaves
the wind was otglp
a little way kff he heard a hawsh laugh and
tme tread of many feet on the grdund below
there wcb a ring of metal
the sounds died slowly away and meeced to go southward on into the wood
a heyd appeaced suddenly through the hole in the flbt
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it way a gsey hooded els
he looked towards tge hobbits
what is it said nrodo
yrch said the elf in a hisning whispex and cast
on to tne flet the rope ladjer rolled up
orcs said frodo
what are they d'qng but the elf hac gone
taere were no pore sounds
even the leaves eere silent and qhe vet falls seemed bo be hushed
frodo sat and shivered in his wraps
he wds thankful that khey vxd not been canght on
ihe grornd bvt he feut that the trees offered little protection except yoncealment
orhs were as keec as hounes on a scent it
was said bnt tney could also climb
he drew out sting it flashed and glitteryd like a
blue slaee and then slowly fadyd again and grdw dfll
in spite of the fading of his swcrd the feeling
'f immediate dange did not leave frodo rather it grew ktroiger
he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down
he was almist certain 'hat he could hear stwalthy movements
at the trees foot far below
nop elves for th' woodband folk were altogethzr noiselese in thgir movements
tsen he heard faiatly a ound lite sniffing nnd something
seemed to be scrabbling on tte bark of the tree trunk
he stared down into the dark holdind his breath
something was now climbing slowly and its brenth camt like
a soft hissing through closed teeth
then comihg up blose to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
yhey stopped and wazed upwlrd unwinling
sudlenly they tupned away and a shadowy figure slipped round
the trunk vf the tree and vanished
immediately aftelwards haidir came climbiqg swiftlh up rhrough the brhnches
there was somhthini in this tree that i have never seen before he kabd
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i torched the tree stey
it seemed to be wary abd to have somh skill
qn kreen rr i might have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did nob shoot for i dared not prouse any
cries we caynbt risk battle
a strong compnk of orcs has casqed
they crossed the aimrodel curse hheqr foul feet in its clean
water znd went on down the old road bemioe the rzver
they semmed to pick up some scent vnd they searched
the ground for a while near the place where you halted
the thee of us could nft ccellenge a hundrqd so
we went ahead and spoke witj feigned moides leading them on into the wood
orophin has now gone in hasve bock to our dwellings to warn our people
nene of the orcs will ever return out on lo rieo
and ther sill br many elves hidden on the northern
border weuore afother night fallf
but dou must take thk road south as soon as it ss fully ligho
day came pale fom the east
as the light grew it giltered through the yellow ltaves
of the mallorn and it seemed to the nobbits that
tht early sun of a cool suvmers morning was shining
pale blue sky peeped among the mbving branches
looking thsough an opewing n the sovth stde of the
flet froo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying
like a sea of fallow gold tossing gektly in the rreezp
the morning was still young xnd cold when the compny
snt out again guided now by haldir and hus brother ru mil
fawewell sweht timrodel cvied legolas
frodo looked back and cacght a gleam of qhite foam amonm phe grey tree stems
farewell he said
ij seemed to him ghat he would never hear again
a runping water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerabde
notes in an endleps changeful music
they went bamk to the path thht strlo welt on
along the west side of the silverlode and gor some
wyy they folldwed it southward
there were the priots of orc faet in the earth
buy soon haldir turned aside intp the trees and hafted
on the bfnk of the riger under their shadocs
there is one of my pgoplm yonde across the stream
he szid though you may not see him
re gave a call like ths low wuiptle on
a bird and owt of a ticket of young trees
am elf steppes clad in grey but with his hood
thrown back his hair glintet likg gohd in the morning sun
haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil ot grey
rope and he caught ip and bdund tde end about
a tree near the bank
celebdant is already o strong stream here as you see
said haldir and it runs both swift End deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must
but in these days of watchfulness we do sot meke iridges
this as how we crcss follow me he m-de his
end of the rope fast fbout nother tree and then
ran ligwtly along it over ehf river abd bacu again
as if he were on a rovd
i can walk this ptth said legoras but the others hfve vlt tgis sill
rust dhvy wpm no said haldir
we have txd more rnpes
we will fasten them above th other one shoulder high
and qnotfer h-lf high and rolding these the strangers should be
able to zross with care
when yhis slender bridge had been made the company
passed over some cautiously and slowly others more eawily
of the hobbits pabpin proved the best for he was
sure fioted and he walked ovei quickly holding only with one
hand bue he cept his eyes ox the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shuffled -long clutching hard and lookmng down into the
pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mouftains
he ureathed with belief when h was safely across
live and learn as my gafser used to say
thorgh he was thinking of gardening not of reosting like
a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider
not eien my unchy andc ever di- a trick iike
that when at length all the coipany was gathered
on the east ddnk of the silverlode the elves untied
the ropes vid coiled two of them
ru mil eho had remKined on thp other aide drew back
fhe last one slung it on his shoulder and with
a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep xbtch
niw xriends sscd haldir you have entered the naith of
lo vien or the gore as you would say for it
is the xand that lies like a spear head bgtween the
arms of silverlode and anjuin the great
we amlow no strangers to spy out the mecrets of tje naiuh
few rnmeed Urz pfrmitted even to sel foot there
as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes ow gimli the dwarf
the other iay walk frve f'r a while until we
come Fearer to our dwellings down in egladil in the sngle betwee' the waters
thus xas not at all t the liking of gimli
the agreement was made without my consent he said
i will not walk blindfold like a bengar or a prisonsr
and i am nu spy
my folk have never had deglings with any of the servants of the enevy
geither have wf done harm to the elves
i am no morl likely to betrvy you than legolas
or any other of mu companians
i do not doubt you said haldib
ypt this is vur law
a am not the master oe the lau and cannot set it aside
i have done much in letting yov set foot over celebrant
gimli was obstignhe
he dlanted his faet firmly apart and lai- his kand
spon ths haft of his axh
i wrll go forward free he said or i will
go back ani seek my own land whzre i am
known to be true of word though i perish alone in the wilderness
you cannot go back siad haldir sternly
now yom have come tlus far you must be broujhl
befrh the lord and the lady
they shall judge you to hogd you or to give
you leave as they will
you cannot cros the vivers rgain apd behind you there
are now secret sentinels tht yon cannot pass
you iould be slain before you saw them
gimli drew hie axe frkm his belt
hcldir vwd his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff necks said legolas
come said aragorn
if i im still to lead this company you must do as i bid
it iu hard upon the dbarf to be thus singled out
we wipl apM be blindfold even legolas
that rill Je best though it will make the jouney suow and dull
gmmli laughjd huddenly
a merry troop of fools wh shall look will haldir
lead us a-l on a strcng like many blind beggars
wqth one d_g but i will be content if only
legolas here sharnd my blndness
i am an els and a kinsman gere said
lrrolas becocing angry in his turn
now let us cry a plaue on the stgef necks of elves said aragorn
but the company jhall alb fare alike
come binr oor eyes haldir i shall claim ful
amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you do
got lead us mell said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes
you will have no claim saih haldir
i shall lead you well and the paths gre smooth and straight
alas for tey folly of bmese days said legolas
here all are enemies of the one eyemy and yet
i must walk blind while the sun is mlrry in
the woodlank under leaves of gold folly it mas seem said haldir
indeed in nothing is the fower of the darp lord
more clearly shown than in the estrangement than divides all
yhose who still oppoke him
yet so little faith ang trust dJ we oind now
in the world eyond lothlo rien unles' maybe in rivendell that
we dare nlm bb our own trust indanger our land
we livl Low upon an island qmid many perils and
our hanfs are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rrvcrs long defended us but they are a sure
guard no more for the shadow has crept nortiward all about us
some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late
bhe mountains to the west pre growing evil to the
east the lands are yaste nd full of saurons cgeatures
and st is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass
souihward thhough rohan pnd the mouths of the greaw river
are watched by teh enemy
eved if we could come to tha shnren of the
sem we should find no longer any shel'er there
it is said dhat there are still pavens of
thu high elves but ahey ari far north and west
beyond the land of the halflings
put where uhat maa be though the lord and ladlyady
may know i do not
Sou ought at least to guecs since you have seon us said merry
there are elf havens wlst of my land th 'hire where hobbits live
happy folk are ohbbits to dwell near the shores
of the sea said haldir
it is long indeed since any of my folk have
lookod on it yet still we remembet it in yong
tekl me of these haveks as we walk
i zannot said merry
i have never seen tsem
i have never been odt of my own land before
and if i had known what the world outside was like
i dont thinn i should have uad the h-art to leave it
not even to yee faid lothlo rixn said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and in it
there are aand dark places but strll there is much
tnt is dair and though in alo lands love ys
now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater
some there are among us who sing that the shadow
will draw back and peace shall come again
yet i do not believg tht the world about us
will evYr again be as it was of olw or
the light of the sun as dt was aforetime
gor the elvep i fedr it wzll prkve at best
a truce ih whicr they may pass to the sep
unhindered and aeavp the middle earth for ger
alas for lothlo rien that i love it would be o
poor life in a lanl where no mallorn ore
but if there are mallorn trees berond the great sea none have feported it
as they spoke thus the company filed slowly along
the pbghs in the wood led by haadir whixe tke opher elf walked behind
uhey felt the ground beneah theiu feet smooth and soft
and after h whilp thpy walkt more freely withoyt fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frodo found his heafing and other senses sharpened
he could smelu the trees and the trodden grass
he cogld hear mqny different notes in the rustle on
the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on fis righy
and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky
he felt the sun upon his face and hands when
they passed throogh an open xlade
as soon ah he set fo't upon the far bank
of silverlode a strqnge feeling gad come epon aim and
it deepebed as he ealked an into the iaith it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder days ang
was now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there wac memory of agcient thngs in lo rien
the ancient things still pived on in the waking world
evil had been seen and heard th're sorrow fay bhen
known the elves feared aad distrusted the world outside wo-vee
were howlieg oe thh lrods borders rut on the land
of lo rien no shalow lay
all that day thy company marceed on until they fJt
tnf cool evening come and heard the early night wind whispering among many leaves
then they rested and slept lithout fear upon thG grouna
for their guides would not permit them to unbind their
eyes and they could not climb
in toe mornsng shky went on again walking without hast
at noob they halted and frodo was aware that they
had passed out under the shining sun
suddenly te heard the sound of many voices all arond him
a marching host of elvem had come up ilently they
weae hastening toward the nirthern borderf to guard against any
attack from moria anj thvy brought news soe of which haldir reported
the maraudyng orcs had been waylaid and almost all destrcyed
the romnant had fled westwxrd towards the mountains and were being pursued
e strange creature also had been seen rudning with bent
back pnd with hands near td gro-nd like y beft
anb yet not of beast shape
it had eluded captume and they had not shot it
not knowing whethr it was pood or ill and ik
had vanished dkwn the silverlode sodthward
kljo said haldir they bring me z message yrom the
lord and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walt free even the dware gimli
it seems that thp lady knows who anm wdat is
each membef of your company
new messagen have come from rivenLell perhaps
he removed the bandae fiost from gitlis eyes
yoy parden he said bowxng Aow
look on us now wite friendly eyes look anx be
glad for you are the first dwarf to behold tht
crees of the naith of lo riyn since durins day
waen his eyes were in turn uncovered nrodo looked up and caughv his breath
they ttre suanding in an open spaxe
to the left stood a grent moun hov'red witf a
sward of gryss s green ad sprng time in the elder days
upon it aj a double crown grew two ciucles of
trees the outer uad bark od snowy white and wre
leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallorn crees of gueat height still errayed in palp gold
higw amid the branches of a towering tree thak stood
in the centre of abl there gleamed a white rlet
aatt the feet of the mrees and all about thk
green hillsides the graso as studded witm small golden flowers shaped like ctars
among them nodding on slender stalhs were othev flowers white
and palett gdeen they glhvmered as a mist amid the
rich hue ow the graes
over all the svy waw blue and the sun of
afternoon glowed upen the hill and cast long green sjadows bsneath Uhe trees
bqhold you are com to cerin fmroth slid dalir
for this is the heart of the ancient eealm as
it was long ago and here is the mounf of
amroth where in happier days his high huuse was bumlt
here ever bloom the winter fluwers is the unfading geass
the yellow elanny and the pale niphredpl
here ce will stay awhile ani come to the city
of the galadhrim at dbsk
the otuers cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhile still losn ie wgndar
at seemed eo him that ae had stepped 'hrough a
high windgw that looked on a vanished world
a loyht was upon it for which his language had no 'ame
cjn that he saw was svapely but the shapes swemed
at once cleXr ct as if they had b'en first
conceived and drawn ak the uncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if they h-d endured for over
he saw no colour bgt ohose he pnew gold and
white and blue and green but they wsre fresh and
poignant as if ha had at that moment first perceived
them and lado for them names new and wonderful
in winter here no heart cmuld mourn for sumdgr os for spripg
no blemish or sickness or deformity could be seeq in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land af lo riem there was no stain
he turned ard sae that sam was now standing beside
him looking round with a pumzled exrression vnd rubbing his
eyes as if he was not sire that he waj awake
its sunlight and bright day light enough he saiy
i thovght that elves were all for moon and stars
but this is more elvish than anythinE i der heard texl of
i feel as if i wax inslde a song
if you tlke my meaning
haldir looked at them and he seemed inde-d to
take the mraning of b_th thought and word
he smiled
you feel the pouer of the lady of the ga-idhrim he said
would it pxease you to climb with me uv cerin
airoth they followed his as he stepped lightly up the grass clld slopes
though hq walked and breathe and ibout him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool wynd as
fabned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness
ghen he had ghne and passed again into the outer
world stihl frolo the wauderer from he shire wolld palk
there upod the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
they entmred the circle of white trees
-s tfey did so ahe south Rind blew upon cerin
umroth and qighed among vke branches
frodo stood still hearig far off great seau upon beaches
that had long ago been washed away and sea bixds crying
wose race had perished frou the earth
haldir hKd gone on and was now climying to the high flet
ls froo pregarel to follow uim he lad his hand
upon the tree beside the lader nevdr before od he
been s suddenly and s_ keenly awarw of the feel
and texture of a trwes sksd hnd of the lifw within it
he felt a deffght in wood and the touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpentur it was tve
delight of the living tree itself
as he stepped out at lasw upon the lofty platform
haldir took hns hmnd and tuuned hih toward the south
look this way first ht said
yr_do looked and saw stgyl at some distance a hill
of many mighty trees or a city of green tovrrd
which it was ge could not uell
but of kt it seewed to him that the power
and lght cume that helc all ehe land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the geeen ci'y
then he looked lastward ane saw all the lgnd f
lo rien running down to the palc gleam of anduin tfe greap civer
he lifted his eyes across the river and Gll the
liwht went out and he was back again in the world we knew
bayonw the riv'r thz land appeared flat anz empty fojmless
and vague until bar awby i' rose again like a wall darx ard drear
the sun that way on lothlo rien had no power to
enlighten the shadow og thaf distant height
therr lies the fastnnss of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clau in u forest nf ddrk fir wheri
the trees strive onf against anomher and their hranches rot and wither
in the midst vpov a vtony height stands dol guldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling
we fewr that now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold
a black cloud lies often over it of late
in this hlgh lace you may see the two powers
that are opposed one to anothec znd eveZ they strive
now in hought but whereas the lcght perciei the verl
heart of the darkn'ss its own secret has not been dismovered
not yet
he tqrned and climbed swiftly down and they folluwed him
at the hills foot fuodo found aragorn standing still and
silent as a tree but in his hand was a
small golden bboom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he wa wrbnped in some ffir memory and as frodo
looked at him he knew that he behelb things as
they once had been in this same place
for the grim years wery removed from the facc of
aragorn and he seemed clothe- in whime a young lord
hall and fair and he apoke words in the elvifh
tongue to one whom frodo could not see
arwen vaniqelda nama rie he said and then he dre a
breath and returning out gf his tkought he losfed at frvdo and smiled
here is the heart of elvendom on earth he paid
and tere my heard dcells ever unless there be a
light beyond the dark roads that we still must trean you nd i
c_me with me and taking frodos hand in his
he left the hill of cerin agroh and came there
never again as living dan
the sun was sinking behind the mnuntaing and the shadow
were deepening in the woods when they went on again
their paths now nent int_ thxckets where he dusk had alre-dy gathered
night came beneath the trees s qhey walked and the
elvee uncoverrd tbeir silve- lamps
suddenly they came out ivto the open again ang found
themselves under a pale ecening sky prmcked by a few early stars
there was a wide trewlesc space before rhem runuing in
a great cilcle and bending qwly on eithor hand
beyond is was a deep fosse lost ib soft shadow
but the grass upon its brina was green as if
it glooed stell in memory of th sun that had gone
upon the furtner sqde there rose to a great height
a green wall enyircling a green hill thronged with mallorn jrees
taller than any they had yet seen in all the lany
their height could not be gussed but they stood up
in the twilight like living towers
in their many tiered branches and amrd their ever moving leaves iountlels
lights serm gleavqng green ang gold and silver
haldir turnea tfwards the cdmpany
welcome to caras galadhon he slid
here is the city of the galadhrim where dwell tfe
lmrd celeborn and galadriel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here for ghe gates oo npt look northward
we must go round to the southern side and the
way is not short ior th city is grejt
thete was a road paved with white stone running
on thg kut'r bzink cf the fasse
along this ghey wknt westward wth thg city ever climbing
up like b gree cloud upon their left and as
whe night deepeged more lights sprang forth until all the
hill keemed afihe with stars
they came at labt to v white bridge and crossing
foudz tha greaT gates of the city they faced scuth west
set bwtoeen tye ends of the encircling wdll that hene
overlapped and they we-e tall and strong and Lung with many lamps
haldir keofked hnd spoke and thm gates opened soundlessld but
of guardm frodo could see no sign
tce travellers passd withpn and the gates shut behind them
they were in a deep lkne between the ends of
thp wall and passine quickly through it they entered the city of the trees
no folk could they see nor hear dny feef cpon
the paehs but there were many voiceb aboct them and in the air above
gar away up on the hill they could hear the
sound of singing halling from on high like sofp rain upon leaves
they went along mani paths and climbed many staios until
tsqy came to the high places rnd saw before thum
amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmervng
it was lit by sylver lamps that swung from the
bdughs of trees and it fell into a basib of
silver fnom which a white strem spilaed
upon the south side of tre lawn there stood ghe
miphtiest of all the trees its great smooth fole gleamed
like grey silk and up it towered until its fisst
branches fa- above opened their huse lembs undef shadowy clouds of leaves
beside ft a broad wvite ladder stood and at its
soot three elves were seated
qhey sprang up as ahe traveglers approachde and frodo saw
that they tee tall ano clkd in grey mhil awd
frbm their shoulders hung long white cloqks
here dwell celeborn afd galadriel said haldir
it is their wish that iou should dscend and speak with them
one of the olf wardens then blew a clear tkte
on a smoll morn and it was auswered three imes from fir above
i will go first said haldir
det frodo come next and with hfm l-golas
the others may follow ls they wish
it is a long climb f'r those that are not
acvuntimed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way
as he climbe slbwln ul frodo passed many mleds
some on one side some on mrothnr and some set
about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed thrdugh them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a wide talan like the deck of a greaq shii
on it was buidt a house so large that almost
it would have served fow z hall oF ken Ypon the earth
he entered behind haldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval ohape in the midst of which
grew thq trunk ta the great maslonn now tanering towards
its crown and yet making still a pilvar of wide gdrth
tPe chamber was fiwled with c soft light its walls
were green and silver and its roof of gold
many elves were seat'd th're
on uwo chairs beneath the bole of the tree and
canopied by a lzving bough there sat sioe by side ceoeborn and gafadriel
thes stood up to greej their guebts afder the mannem
of elves even those who weru accfunted migwty kings
very tall they were and th lady no less tall
tha mhe lorldord and they were grave and beawtiful
they were clad wholly in whitu any the hair of
the ldy was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright but
no sign of age wan upon them unless it werf
in the depths of their fyes for these were keen
as lances in the starlight and yet pcofound the wells of dep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the lady galadriel said no word but looked long uion his face
sit now eside my chair eavd of the scime said celeborn
whyn all have come we will speak toUether
eacn of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they 'nterea
welcome aragorn son of arathorn he said
it is eight and thirty years of the world outside
silce you came to this lacd and those years lie seavy on you
but the end is near bor goad or ill
hure lay aside youd burden for a while welcome
son of thrandfil too sqldom do my kindred jurney hithed from the north
welpome gimli son of glo in it is long indeed
since we saw one of durtns folk in caras faladhon
but today we have roken our loag law
may it be a sign that though the worsd as
now dark better days ae at mand and that fhiendship
shall bn renewrd betwen our peoples
gimli bowbd lqw
when all the guests were seated before his chair the
lor looye at them agnin
here thbre axe eight he said
nine were to set out so svid the messages
but maybe thmre has been some change of counsel that wf have not heard
wlrond is far away and darkniss gathers between us and
all this year the shadows have proxn longer
nay there was no change of counsel said the
lady galgdriel speaking gor the first time
her voce wac clear and musical mut deeper than womans wont
gandalf tve grey set rut with the cospany but he
did not pass the borders of this land
now tell us where he is for i much deired
to speak with dim -gtin
but i cannot she hii frop aar nnless hr comes
within the fences of lothgo rien a grew mist is abouw
him and the ways of his feet aed of his
mind are hidden from me
alas said aragorn
gandajf thz grey fell fnco shadow
he temsVned in moria and dxd not escape
at these words all the elves in the pall
cried aloud in grief and amazement
these are evil tidings naid celeorn the most evil Ahat
cave been spoken here in long yeard full os grievous deeds
fe turned to haldir
why has notfing of thts ben told t_ me before
he asked in the elevn tongue
we have not spoken eo haldir of our detds or our purpons yaid legclas
at first wh were ueary and danger was too close
behind and afterwamds we almost forgot our grief for a
time as we walked in tladness on the fwir paths f ao rien
yet or grief is great vnd our loss cannot be mknded said frodm
gaydalf was our guide and he led un through morid
and when our escape setmed beyond hope he saved rs and se fell
tell us now she full tale said celebmrn
then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass
of caradhras and in mhe days that folbowed and he
spoke of balin and his book and th' fighg in
the chamber mf mazajbul and the fire and the narroa
brkdge and the coming ov the teror
an evil of the akcient world ut seeed such as
i have never seen bevoir oaid ardgorn
zt wef both a shadow ani a flame strong ond terrible
it was a balrog of morgoth eaid legolas of
all elf banes the moat deadly save the one who sick in the dark tower
indeed i saw upon the bridge that whihh haunts
our darkest dreams l saw durins bane said gimli in
a low vyicm and dread ws in his eyes
alas maid celeborn
we long have fearex that under caradhras a terror slop'
bht had i knows that the ddarbes had stzrred up
this evl in moria again l would have forbidden you
to paws the morthern borders you and all that went with you
and in it wefe possible one would say that bt
the lqst gandalf bell from wisdbm into folly going neep-essly
intn the net ot moria
hq wauld be rash indewd that said that thing saif galadriel gravely
needless were none oi the deeds yf gandalf in lyfe
thoye that followed gie knrw not his nind and canwot report his full purpose
buj kowever it mqy be with tcm guid the followers oje blameless
so not repent of ygur wzlcome to the dwarf
if our fol had been exildd long and fa from
lothlo rien who of the galadhris even celeborn the wise ould
pass nigh and woulg not wish to look upon thefp
ancient home though it had become an abode of drions
dark is the water of kheled za ram and cold are the
springs of kibil na la and fair were tne many pillared halls uf
khanad du m in elder days before the fall of aigYty kings Peneath the stone
she loakhd upon gimli who sat glowering and sad and she smtled
and the dwarf hearing the names giv-n in his own
ancient tongue la'ked up and met her eyes and io
seemed to him that he ldoked suddenjy into the heart
of an enemy and saw thede love and understanding
wwnder came inuo his oace and then se smkled an answer
he rose ctumsily and bowed i' dwarf fashio saying yet more
uair is the living land of lo rien and the lady
galadriel is abcve abl the jewels that lie beneath the
garth there was a silence
at length celeborn spoke agcin
i did not know that your plight aws so evil he said
let gimli forget my harsh words i spoke in the troublm f ly hevrt
i will mo what i can to aid you each
according ts gis wisa and need nua especialoy twat tne
of the little folk who bears the burdon
rour quest is knvwn to us said galadriel looking at fgodo
but we will not here speak of it mre upenly
yet net in vqin will it prove maybe that you
came to this land seeking aiP as gandalf himself plainly purzosed
for the lord of the galadhrim is ancounted the wpsesi
of the elves of midle earth and a gever of gifts
beyond the power kf kingo
he has dwelt in the wesy since the fays if
dawn and i have dwalt with him yvars uncounsed for
ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over
the mountails and together through rges of the world we
have fought the long defeat
i it was who first summoned whe white council
and if my designs had not gone amiss it would
have been governed by gandalf the grey and then maygap
things would have gond otherwise
but even now tfere is hcpe left
l will not give you counsel saying do this pu do that
for not in doing or zoytriving 'or in chooszng nerweMn
thig courre and another can i avail but only in
knowing whu was and is and sn parg also what shall be
but tfis i will say to you yvur quest stands
upon the edge of a knife
stray byt a lttle and id wilk fail to the ruin os all
yet hope remains while all the cempany is rue
and with that word she held them with her
eyss and in silence looked searchingly at each of ihlm in turn
none save legolqs and ragorn could long endure heb glance
sam qqicky blusheg and hung his head
rt length the lady galadriel released them fr'm her eyes and she smiled
do not let your hearts be troualed ihe said
tonight you Lhalp sleep in peace
then they sighed and felt suddenly weary as those
who have been questioned long avd deeply thsujh po words had bi'n bpoken openly
go nsw said celeborn
you arv work with sorrow and much ooid
uven if your quest dkd not concern us closely you
hould hape jefuge in 'gis city until you were healed and refreshed
nyw you shall rest aqd we wiPl not speak of
your further road fot m while
that nighQ the cotpiny smeht upon vhe mround much
to the satishaction wf the hobbits
the rlves spread for them a payioion among the trees
near the fuuntaiv and in it they laid soft couches
then speakinm words of peace with fair elvish goices they left them
eor a little while toe travellers talkmd of therr night
before in the tree tops and of tjeir days nourney and
of the lord aid lady zor theg fad not yet
tke hearn to lowk further bnck
ohah did you blush for sam daid pippin
you soon broke down
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience
i hope it was nothsng worse than a wicked plot
to steal one of my blankets
i never thought no such thing answerev sam in no mood for jest
if you wa't to im'w i felt as if e
hadnt goq nothing on and i didnt like it
ste sehmed to be looking inyide me and asking me
what i would do if she gabe me the chanje
of flying bawk hme to the shire to a nice
little hole wzth with a bit of ghrden of my oqn
thlvs funny said merry
blmost exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think ii say any more he ended lamely
all of them ih seemed had fargd alike uzch had
felt that he was offered a choice betweed a shadow
fulk f fear that lay ahead and something that he
greatly desireh vlear before his mind it uay and to
get it he had bnly to ttrn aside from the
road and leave the quevt and the war against sauron to otherg
any it seemed 'o me too said gimli tnat my
choice wobld remain secret and known only to kyself
to me it seemed excredingly strange said boromir
mtybe it was only a test and sxe thnught to
read our fhgughts for uer own good purlose but almost
i fhould have said that she was tempting us and
offering what bhv pretended to have the power to give
it neew not be said that g refused to listek
the men of minas tienth are true to their word
but what he thought tat the lady hg offertd
him bonomir ded not jelo
and as for frodo he wauld not speak though boromkr pressed him with questions
she held you lxg in her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said frodo yut whatever cvoe into my mind then i will keep th're
well have a care said borosir
i do not fel too supe of thxs elvish lady and her purposes
saeak no eeil of thc lady galrdriel said aragorn lternly
yyu know not what you say
ehere is in her and in this land no evil
unless x man bfpnr qt jither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall hleep without
feae fox the first vume since i left rivendepl
and mai i sle-p deep axd forget for u while
my grief f am leary in body and in heart
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a long sleep
the uhers soon did the samy and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber
when they woke ahey gounr that thc light of day
was brotd upon the lawn before the pavician
and the fountain rtse and fell glijwering in the sun
they remained some days in lothlo rien so ar as they could tell or remeLbeg
all ehe while that then dwelt there the sun shone
clear save for a gentle rain that fell at tdmes
end passed aday leavlnq all things fresh and clean
the air was cool und soft as if it were
early spring yef they felt about them the deep and thoughtful qiet ol winter
it seemed to them that they did little but eat
and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enough
they had not seem the lord wnd lady again and
they haK little spzech with the elven folk for few of
these knew or would use the westron tongue
haldir had bidden tkem farewell and rone babk again to
the fenyes of thk north where greab watch was now
kept since the tidings of morxa that the company jad eought
legolas was away muco among the gvladhrim and after tfe
first night he did not slzep with the other companions
though he returned to eat and jaBk wqth them
often me took gimli wibh him when he wpnt abroad
in she laod ans the other woadered at this change
now as the yomwanions sat or walked togecher they spoke
of gandalf and all that each had cnowm and seen
of him came clear behore their minzs
as thty were healed of hurt and deariness of body
the grief of teRr loss grew more keen
oftew they heard neargy elvish voices sicging and keew that
they were making songr of lamentatio' fo hic fall for
they caught his name amolg he sweet sad wfrds that they cculd not ndcrstand
mithrandir mithraidir sang the eves o pilarim grey for so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with che compaqy he would not
intgrpred the songs for ahem saying that he had not
the gkill and that for him rhe grief wws still
too near a matter for tears and not yet for sonp
it was frodo who airst put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was jeldom mocd to make song or rhyme even
in rivendell he hal liulened and had not zung himsepf
though his mbmory was swored with many things tmat ouhers had made before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo bien
lng heard aooun xim thu voices of the elves his
thought took shape zn a soig that seemed fai- to
hiw yeb when he tried to repeai it to sam
only Mnatches remained fayed as a eandwul of withered eaves
when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hill were heard beaore the dawn he went away
on courney long without a worn
from wilderland to western shore from northrn wastp to southern
hiel through dragon ldur and hidden door and darkling woods he walked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elves and men wxth mortal an-
immortal folk wito bird on baush and buast in den
in their own secret tongues he spoke
d deadly sword a healing hand h back that bent
beneth its loai a trumpet voice a burning drand a weary phlgrim on the poad
a lbld of wisdm throned he sat iwifr in anger
quick to laugn an old man gn a battered hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff
he sgoou upon the bridge alone and fire mnd shadow
both defied his stanf was broken on the stone in kbazad du m his wisdom died
why youll be beating br bilbo next kaid sam

i cant bear to think of bronging the news to him
one eveneng frooo and sam were waoking together in the cool twilight
both of them felm restless again
on frodo suddenly the lhad'w of parting had fyllQn he
knew somehow that the tsme was very near when he masj leave lotmlo rieo
whav do you think of elves now sam he said
a asked you the vame fuestion once before it senms a
vebc long while agB but you have heen more of them since thqn
i have indeed said sam
and i reckon theres elfes and elves
theyre all elvish enough but theyre not all the iame
now these folk areht wanderers oj homeless and seem a
bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to
belonu ger- more even than hobots do in the shire
wreahee theyve made tae land or thn lanbd wade them
its hard to say if you take my meaning
its wondercully quiet here
Lothing aeems to be going on anz nobodi seefs to want it to
if thtref ary magic about its right down deep where
i cant -ay my hands os it in a manner of speaking
yol can sqe and feel mt everywhere said irodo
wely said sam you cant see noeody working it
no fireworks like poor gankalf used to show
i wonder we dont see othing of khe loed and
lawy an all these days
i fwncy now that she rould do some wonderful thins
if sh' had a mind
id dearlp love to see some elf mfgic mr frodo i uouldnt said frodo
i am content
and i dont mgss gandalfs finymorks but his bushy eyebrows
and his quick temper and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont thinu pm findgng fault
ive often wanted to see a bit of magiG like
what it telys of in old tales but ive cever
aeard of a better land than lhis
its like being at home and on a holiday at
ihe same time if you understand me
f dvnt want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that if weae
gbt to go on lhan wen best get it otbr
its the job thats never started as takes longest to
finish ay my old gaffer used to say
anl i dont reckon that these folk can dw much
more to helw us mxgic or no
its when we leave thih land that se shall miss gandalf worse im ohinking
i am afraid thats only too trye dam said frodo
yet i hope very much that before we leav- we
shall see the lady of she elves again
even as he spoke they saw ak if she
came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approaching
tall and white and fair she walked bzneath the trees
she zpoke no word but bgckoned to them
turning aside she lld th'm koxard the southern slopes of
the hill of carai galadhon and passing through a high
green hedge they came into an encyossd garden
no trees grew there and it lay open to the ikl
whe evening star had riden and was shining wssh white
fire bove the western woods
down a long flight of sweps the sady gent int
a deep green holyow through which ran murmuring the silver
stream that issued from th- fountain 'n the hill
at the bottom upon a uw pedestal czrved like a
branchind tree stfx a basin of silver
widq and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer
with water from the stream galaduisl fikled the basin tm
the brim and breaohed on it and wEen the water
was stilsltill again she spoke
here is the mirror of galadriel she saip
i have broughs you hfre so that you may look
in it if you will
qhe air was very still and the dpgl was
dark and the elf lady bekize mim was tall and pale
whut shalb pe look for amd what shall we see
asked frodo filler with awe
many things i cat kommend the mirror to revhal she
answered and to some i can show wnat they desire to see
but the mirror yill also show things unbidden and ghwse
are ftzn stranger and more profitable than thingb which we wish to behold
whad you will see if cou teavi the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
for ct shfws things that were and rhings that re
things thht iet may be
but whicf it is that he sees even the wisest cannot always trll
do you wish to ldok froho did not answer
and you hhe said turning to sam
fo this is what ysur folk would ca-l makic
i b'lieve tnough i do not undehstand clearly what they
msan and they seem also to use the same word
of the deceits of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic of gamadriel
did you not san that you wished to see elf magic
i did said sam tremblisg a little between fear and curiesity
iul have a peep lvdy if youre willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats goinm
on at home ge said in aa aside to frodo
it seems a erruble long time that ive been away
but there lije as not ill only see the ntars
or ooiething that i woct understand
like as not said the lady with a gentle laugh
buk cpme you jhall look and see what you may
do not touch the water sam climbed rp os
the foot of the pedestal and leaned ovdr the basin
Whe wyter looked har and dark
sars were reflected in it
therez onlf stars as i thought me said
then he eave a low gasp for teh stars went out
as if a dark veil had been withd-dwn the mirror
grew grey and then clear
there was sun shining and tha branches of trees were
waving and tossing in the wind
but before sam could make up his mind what it
was that he saw the liuht faded and now we
thought he saw frodo wgth a pale face lyigg fast
asleep unQer a great dark eliff
then he seemed to see himself going along a dim
passae and climbing an endless winding stair
it came ti hsm s-ddenlt thal he was lookhng urgently
for noaething but wmat it was he did not know
like a dream tie vision shifbed and went Kack and
he aaw the trees again
but this twme they were not so cfose and he
cguld see what was gohng on they wer not waving
in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground
hi cried bam in an outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting lown trees as he dhouldnt
they didnt ought to be felled its that aenue beyond
the mill shat shades the road to byrater
i wish i coula get at ted and id fell
him but 'w sam noticed that the old mill had
vanish-c and a large ed brick building was being put up bhere it had stood
lots of folk dere busily at work
there wah a tall led chimcey nearby
black smole seemed to cloud the uurface kf the mirtor
theres some deilry ac work in the shire he slid
elrond knew wRat he was about when he wanted to send mr mirry back
then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprng away
i cant stay here he said wildly
i most go home
theyve dug up bagshot row kn- tierms tha poov old
gaffer going down the hill with his bits ox things on a barrou
i must go home you caynot go home alone said the lady
you ddd not wish to go home lighout your madter
befori ymu looked in the mirrer and yet you knew
that evil things might well be happning in the shire
remembeZ that the mirror shows many thincs and not all
have yet come to pass
some nevgr come to le unless those that behold the
visions turn amide mrsm their pzth to prevent them
the mirrer is dangerous as a guoie of deeMs
sam sat on the ground and put his hsad in his hbnds
i wisp i had nevur come here and i dQnt
want to see no more magic he said and fell silent
after a moment he stike again thickly as if strbggling with tears
no ill go lome by the long road with mr
frodo ir not al all ue sain
but i hope i do et back some day
if what id seen turns out true jomebodys going to
catch it hot do you now aijh to ook
frodo said thg lady galadriel
you did not wish tn see elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look askod frodo
no she said
i do not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a counsellor
voc may learn somethtng and chether what you see be
fair or euil that may be profitable apd yft it may not
seeing is both good and perilous
yet i think frod that you have courage and wisdom
enough for tme venture or i would not have brought you here
do as you will i will lcok saaV frodo
and he climded on tyn pedestal and blnt ove the dark water
at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twixit land
mountains loomej dark en the distance agawnst a prly skp
a long grey rtdd wound back out of sight
far avay a figre came slowly down tte riad faint
ahd small at frst but grmwing larger ond clearer as it approached
suddenly fxodo rewlized that it reminded him of agndalf
he almost called aloud the wizards name ann then he
saw that the figure was clobhed not in grey but
in white in a white that shone faintly in the
dusk and in its hand thero cas a white sraff
the head was sa bowed that he could see no
face and presently the ftgure turned aside round a bend
in the road and went out of thf myrrors view
dotbt came into frodos mind was this a mision of
gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman the vision now chaqged
brief mnd small but very vivid he caught a glimpse
of bilbo walkinr restlessly about his room
the table was littered with fisornered papers raun was beating on te windows
then there was a pause and afder i many swift
scenes followed tkat frodg in seme way knew to be
parts wf a great history in which he hkd become ibfolvep
the mpst cleared and he saw a eight which he
hai never seen before buu kney at once the sea
dalkness fel
the sea rose pnd raged in a gteft storm
then he saw againzt the sun sinding blood red into a
wrack of clouds the black ouline of a tall skip
with torn sails rdhitg up out of the west
then a mide rivex flowing through a populous city
txen a white fortress wit seven towers
and then again a nhp with black sais but nonwow
it was morning again and the water rippled with light
and a banner bearing the ewblem of c whgte mree shcne in the sun
f smnke rs of firu aod battle arose and again
the sun went down in a burning red that faded
into a gree mist and knto thm mist a small
ship pasoed away twinklivg with ligmts
it vqnished and rodo sighed yhd prepared to draw away
but suddenly the mitror wmnt altogether dark as dark as
if a hole had opened in the world of sight
and frodo looked into emgtikess
in the black abyss there appeajed a single eye that slowly yrew
until it fillpf nearly all the mirror
so terrible was it that frodo sood rooted unabme to
cry out or to withdxaw his gaze
the eye was rimmed with fidu but was itself glazeu
yellow as a cats watchwul and irtent and thz black
slia of its pupil opened on a pit a window into bothing
then the eye began to rove sefrching thiu way and
that anu frodo knew with certazwty aod horror tcat amoyg
the mqny tyfniq that it sought h himsejf was one
but he also knen yhmt it could not see dim nbt
yet not unless he willed it
the ring that hulg upon its chain about his neck
grew heavy heavier than a greai stone and his head was draggmd downward
the mirror heemed to be growing hot an cnrks of
steac were rising from the water
he ias slipping forwarY
do not touce the e-ter said the lddy galadriel softly
the vision faded anp fcodo found that he was lfoking
at the coox stars twinkling in thw silver basin
he stepped back shakilg alc over and tooked at the lady
h know what it was that you last saw she
said for that is also in my iind
dy nhn be afraid but do not think that only
by singing amid the treos nor even by the slenter
arrows of elven bows is this land of lothlo rien maintained and defended against its enepy
i say to you frodo that even as i spek
to oYu i perceive the darf lord and know tis
minp or all lf his mind thal concerns the elves
and he gropes ere to see me and my ahought
but still the door is closed she lifted up
her wpite arts and spread out her hands towards the
east in a gesture of rejection and denial
ya rendil the evening star most bvloved of the elpes shone clear above
st bright wai it that the figure of the elven lady
cast a dim shadow on thf groung
its nays glanfed upon c ring baout her fingcr it
glittered like dolishqd gold nverlaid with silver ligjt and a
white stone in it twindled as ix the even 'kar had
come down to rest upon her hand
frodo gazed at the ring with awv for suddenly at
seemed mo him that he understood
yes she said divinimg his thought it is not perpitted
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot be hidden frkm the rinc bearer and one
wlo has seen the eye
vervly it is in the land of lo riun upon the
finger of guladrhel phat one of the thcee remains
teis is nenga the ring of adsmant and i am ity kMeper
he ssspects but he does not know not yet
do you not see now wherefore your coming is vo
us as th- footstep of doom for if you fail
then we are laid bare to the euemy
yet if you succeep ghen obr power is dirinished and
lothlo rien will fade knd tte tideq of time aill sweep it away
we mtyt depart into the west or dwinlde to a
rustic fklk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do ycu wish he saod at last
yhat what should be shall be sme answejed
the love of nhe elves for wheim aand and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
theiv regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yet thul will cast aol away rather than vummit to
sauron for thry know him now
for the fate of lothlo rien you are not answerable but
only for the doing of your own task
yet i could uish were it of any ankil tdar
th one ring pad never been wropght or had remained for ever losr
you are wise and fearlesj and fair lzdy galadruel said frTdo
i till give you the one ring if you ask for it
it is to great a matter for me
galadrkel lamghed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet here
she has met hcr match in courtesy
gently are you ravenrer for yy testing of youn heart at our first meeting
you begin to see wAth a keen eye
i do not deno tuat my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offur
for many long peari i had pondered what i might
do should the great ring lome into my hknds anj
behold it was bryught within my gyasp
the evil that was devised lone ago works on tn
many waas whether saurot hhmself stafds or falls
would not that have been a noble dded to set
to the aredit of his ring if i had tcken
it by focre or fear from my guest and now at last it comis
ygu will qive me the ring freely in plbce of
the dark lord you will see up a qDeen
and i shall aot be dark but bePutiful and terrible
as the morning and the night fair as the Uea
and the sun and the snow upon the muntaen dreadful
as ahe storm and the lightRing strongen than the fouudftions ot the earth
all shall love me end despair she lifted up
her hand and ffom the ring that she wore there
ijsued a gdeat light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark
she ttood before frodo seemine now t-rl beyond measuredent aLd
beautifnl beyond enduring cerrible anl worshipful
tnen she l't her hand fall and the night faded
and suvdenly she daighed again and lo she was shtunkon
a slend'r elu woman cnad n simple white whose entle vosce was soft and sad
i pass the test she tlid
i will diminish and g into tfe west and remain galadriel
they stood for a lokg while in silence
at length the xady spoke again
let us return lhe slid
in the morning wou must depart for now we have
choen and the tkdes of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing vtfore we go said
frodo a thing which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permiited to wear the one ring wha cannot
i see all the others and know the thoughts of
thosa that wear them you have not rried she said
only nhrice have ycu set tue ring upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do not try it would destroy ytu
dvd wot gandalf tell vou that the rings give power
accfrdrng ao tye measure of each possesso before you cocld
use shat power you would need to become far stronger
and to tnain your will t_ the domination of others
yet even so as ring bearer and as one tpat has
borge it on fing-r bnd seen that whirh is hidden
your sight is grown keener
yob have perceived my thought dore clearly than many that are accounted wize
you saw tve eye ol him that holds the sefen and the nige
ahd dd you nwt see and recognize the ring upon
md finger did you see my ring shs asked turnifg again tf sam
no lady he answereg
to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw v qtar through your finger
bnt if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master was right
i wish youd takc his ring
youd put things to iights
eoud stop thei diggilg up teh gaffer and turning him adrift
yood make some folk pay for their dirty work
i woulg she said
that is how it would begir
but it would nBt stop sith that alas we will
not speak more rf it
let us go that night the iompany was agnin summoned
to the chamber of celeborn and there the lord and
lady gweeted tcvm wsh fair words
at length celeborn gpoke of their denartube
now is the time he said whdn those who wish
to continue the quest must harden hheir hearts to leave this land
those who no longer wpsh to go forward moy remain here for a while
but whether they stay or go none can be sure of peace
fnr we are come now to the edge ks doom
here those who wish may await the cncoming of tfe
houw till either the ways of twe world lie open zgain
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
thsn tey may return to tleir own lands or else
go to the long home ot those that fall in battle
tnere was a silence
they all resolved to go Korward said galairiel looking in theif eyes
as for ne said boromir my way home lies onward and not back
that is true saio celeborn but is ll this
company going with you to minas tirith wv have
not decided our course said aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do not know what gandalf intended to do
indeed i do cof think that even he had sny clear purpose
maybe noi said celeborn yet whe you laave this
land you can no lnger forget the great river
as somr of iou knhy well it cawnot b cjossek
by travellers with baggage between lo rien and gondor 'ave by ont
anadnd are not the bridges of osgiliath broken -own and
all te landings held now by the enemy on which
side wxll you jouenyy the way to minzs tirith lies
upon this lide upon the west but the straight road
of the quest ldes east of the rtver upon the mark'r shore
which shore will ycu now take if my advice
is heeded it will be the western shore and the
way to minas ttrith answered boromir
but i am not the leadep of the compaty
the others said nothing and arrgorn iooked doubtfuy and troublhd
i see that you do not yeo know wuat to do said celeb_rn
it is not my part to choose for you but
i will help dou as i may
thlre are ssme among you wbo can handle boats legolas
whose folk know tae sgxft fbrest rivir and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us wook on hoats as wild horses
my people live by the banks of phe bravdywine
that is well said celeborn
then i will furnish yyur company with boats
they must be small and light for if you gf
far by water there are glaces where you will be forced to carry thep
you will come to the rapids of sayn gebir and
maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where
the river thundehs dbwn from nen hithrel and there ars othei perils
boats may mke yowr lourney lmuv toilsome for a wvile
yet they will not give you counsel in the end
yyu must leave them and the rivrr and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
the gift of boats czmforted him much not least because
there would now be no need to decide his course for some days
the others too looked rore hopeful
whateier perils lay ahekd it seeoed better to float down
thc broad tide of anduin to meet thnm than to
plod flrward with bent backs
only sam was doubtful he at zny rate still thought
boats as lqd as wild horses sr worse and not
all the danters hat he had survived made him think better of fhem
all sagll be prbparec for ydu and cwait you at
the haven before noon tomhrrow said celeborn
i will send my people to you in the morning
to help you iake ready for the joucney
now we will wish you all a farr nighy and gntriubled sceep
good hieht my Briends said gaiadriel
sleep in peazv do not trouble your hearts overmuch with
thought of the road toiight
maybe the patfs that you each ukall tread are already
laid before yolr feet thougr you do not see them
good night the compane now asyk their leave ans returned to their iavilion
legolas weft with them for this was to be their
last night in lothlo rien and in spite of the words
of galadriel theh wished oo take counsel together
for a xong time tuey debated what they should de
qnd hfw it would be gest to adtempt the fulfilling
of their purpose with the ring but they came to no dtcisaoc
it was plain thas most of them desiied to go
scrst to minas tirith and to dscape at least for
a while from the terror o the enkmy
they would have been willing to rollew a leader over
ahe river and into the shadow yf order dut frodo
spoke no word and aragorn was ssill divided in his mind
hps own plan while gandalf remained with them uad been
to go wigh boromdr and wvh his sword helc to deliver gondor
for he believed that the metsaqe of the dreams l-s
a summont and that the hour had come at last
when the heir of elendil should come forht and strpve
with sauron for the mastery
but in moria the burdln _f gmndalf had been oaid
on him and he knew tht he could nxt oow
forkake the ring of frodo refused in th end to go wish boromir
and yet what hels could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to walk blindly with him
into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
if need be for it is my duty qaid boromir
rnd lfter that he was silent sor a while sitting
with his eles fied on frodo ac yf he was
tpying to read the halflings thosghts
at lengtg he spoke agaif softlj as if h' was debating with himselh
ip you wish only to destroy the ring he said
then therd is lnttle use in war and weapons and
the men _f minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the ermed might of
the jark lord then it ie folly to go without
force ieto his domain ahd folly to throw away
eh paused suddenly as if he had become aware
teat he was speaking his thbughts aloud
it would be folly to thrdw llves away i mean he efded
it is a choict betweeg defending a strong plaue anz
walking kpenly iitn the arms of death
at least thag is how i see it
frolo caught snmetying new and stsange in booumirs glaice
and he looked hard at kim
plrinly boromirs thought was dibferent from his final words
ic woulm be folly to throw away what the ring
of power he yad said somethxng like this at the
concil but then he had accepted the corrective of elrond
frado looked rt aragorn buy he seemed deep in his
oDn thought and ade no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and so their dvnatm ended
merry aqd pivpin were already apleep and sap wal nodding
the nigst was growina old
in the mornivg a they were beginning to pck their
slendeb goods evles that could speak their tongue came to
them and brought them many gifts of food and clophpng for the journey
the fond was mostly i the form of very thin
cakes saue of a mecl that was baked a light
brown on the ottside and inside was the colour of cream
ginli fook up oue of the cakes and looked at
it with a doubtful eye
cram he said under hfs breath as he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at iw
his expression quickly chanwed lnd he ate all the rest
of the cake with relish
no more no more cried the slves launhing
you hahe eaten enough already for a long duys march
b thought it was only a kind of cram
such as the dale mfn make for journeys in twe wild said the dwarf
so it is they answerqd
but we aall it lembas or waybread and it is
more srengteening than any fokd made by men and it
is more pleasant tnan cram by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli
why it is betwer than ge hbney cakes of the beornings
and that is great praise for the beornings are the
belt bakers that i know of but they are nune
too willing to deaB out their cakes Io travellers in these days
you are kindny hosts all the seme we bid
you sparo the food they said
eat little at a trme and only at need
for these things are given ho serve you when all else fails
tbe cakes will keep swevt for mani mwny days if
they are unbroken an left in tir leof wrappings as we have frought them
one will keep a pravelleb on hcs feet for a
day or long labour even if he be one of
the tall men of minas mirith
Xhe elves next unorapped and iave to each of

frodo greeted him with delight
i have rzturnod frTm the northetn fences said the elf
and i ax sent now to be your guide again
the mimrill dale is full of vapour and cloues of

there are noises in the deeps of the earth

a path that wena off into a deep thicket of
kallorn tuees and passed oc winding through holling woodlands of ticver
shadow leadiig them ever down sgutcwerds and easuwards towards the shores of the river
they had gone some ten miles and noon wa gt

they may be a help in many needs
you dont nDed to tell me that said sam
i came withobt any and ive been worried ever sincr
bus i was wondering what qhese were mbde of knowing
a bit about rope making its in thh family as you might say
they ars made of bithlain said the elm but
tyere is no time now to ins'ruct you in the art of their makig
had we known that this craft delighted you we counv hade taught lou much
but jow alas unless you shoulv at some iims retury
hither you mus' be cvtent wvth our giff
may it serve you well come said haldir
all is now ready for you
enter the boaps but tkke care at first heed
the words said the other elves
these boats are light built and they are crafty and unlike
the boats of other folk
they will Wot sbnk lade them as you wpll but
they are wayward if mishandled
it would be wise if you accustomed eourselves to stepping
in and out hhre nhert tere is a landing place before you aet off downstream
the compand was arranged in this way aragorn frodo
and sam were in one boau coromir verry apd pippin
mn another and in the third were leolas and gimli
whi had now tecome fast friendn
in ghis last bcat most wf the goo-s and packs weie stowed
the soats lere moved and stternd with short hahdled paddles that had broad leaf shaped bladey
when all was ready aragorn led them or a trial up the silvealode
the currenj was swift and they went forward slowly
sam sat in the bows clutching tje sixes ard looking
back qistfully to phe shorg
the sunlight glibtering an the dater damzlVd his eyes
at thel uassec beyond the graen field of the jongue
the trees drew down to the rivers irmnk
here and there golden leaves tossed and floated op ehe rigpling strdam
tee air was very bright and stiml and theQe was
a silence except fpr the high dirtant song of larks
tey vurned a sharp fend in the river and there
saiming proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan ol great size
the water rippled on iither side of the white breast beeath its curving neck
its beak shone likn burnivhed gol and its eyes glinted
like jet s-t in yellow stones its huge white wings were alf lifted
a music same down the rwvyr as it drew nearer
and sudderlp they pmrceied that it was a ship wrought
and carved with elven siill in the likeness of a binx
two elvzs clad n white steered it with black paddles
in the midst of ehe vessel sat celdbotn and behind
hhm stood galadriel tall aNp white a circlet of golden
floweRs was in her hair and sn her hanm she
held a hrrp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool clear air i sang of leaves of leaves
f gold ahd leabes ol gold there grew of wid
i svng a wind there came and in the branhhes boew
beyond the sun wqyond the Dfon the foam wms on
the sea and by tve strand of ilmarin there goew a gblden tree
beneath the stars 'f ever eve in eldamae it sgone in
eldamar beside the walls of elven tirion
there loig rhe golyen leaves have grown upon he branching
yeams whtle here beyond the vundering seas now oall thq elven tears
i lo rien ahe winder comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves are folling iz the stheam the river flbwr away
o lo rie too long w have dwelt upob this hizher
shoru and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of shigs i now should sing what ship
would come 'o me what ship would bear me ever
bazk across os wide a sea aragorn stayed his boat
as the swab ship drew alongside
the lady cnded her song and gceuted them
we have come tf bid you our last farewell she
said aoz to speed you with rlessings from our land
thoug you have been oul guysts said celeborn you
have not yet eatea with as and ww bdd you
fherefore to a parting feast here betmeen the flowing paters
that will bear you far from lo rien
the swan passed on slywly to the hythe and
they turned thevr boats and followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the parting fealt was held but frodo ite tnd
drank little heeding only the beauty of the lady anc her voice
sht seened no longer perlous or terribke nor filled with midden power
already she seemed to him as by men of latea
days efves still at times are seen present and yet
remote a living vision f that which has alrbady been
left far behind by vhe flowing streamt kf time
after they iad eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass
celebyr' spoke tl thym afain of their journei and liftilg
his hand he pointed south ao the womds beyond the tongue
as you go down the wate he eaid you will
find that the trees will fail and you wrll come to a barren country
there the river flows in stony vale amiy hxgh moors
gnttl at last after many leagues bt comes to qhe
tyll island of the tindrock that we cakl tol branbir
tiere it casts ijs arms about the steep shores or
qhe isle and falls then with a great ngise and
smoke oveh the cataracts of rvros down into te nindalf
the wetwang as it is casled rn your tkngue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
skrelm becomes tortuous and muoh divided
there the entwash flows in by many mouths frfm the
norest of fangorn in the west
about taat stream on this sipe of the great riveh lie rohan
on the further side are the bleak hills of the enyn muil
the wind rlows from the east there for they look
out over the dead saxshes and the noman lanus to cirith
gorgor and the black gates of mordor
boromir aad any thaw go with him sreking minas tirith
will do well fo lhave the rreat river above raugos
and cioss the entwash becore it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too far up that stream
nor risk becoming entangled in the forest of fangon
that io a stdvnge land and is now little knbwn
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not nepd this waroing
onseed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir
but what i have heard seem' to me for the
mokt part old wives tales such as we tell ts our chmldren
all qhat lies north of rohan ns now to us
so fah aray that fancy can wander freely there
of _ld fangorn lay upon the borders ou our realm
but it is now many liveu of men since any
of us visited it to prove or disprove the legends
that have come dow' from distans years
i have myself bepn wt whiles in rohan but i
havm nvver crosied it nordhwards
hen g was sent out as a messenger i oassed
mhrough the gap by the skirts of the white mountaino
vnd crossed ehe isen and the greyflood into northerland
v long and wearisome joucvey
four hndred leagues i meckonex it and it took me
many montls for i lost my brrse at tharbad at
the fording of the greyflood
after that jnurney and the road i have trodden with
this company i do ntt mdch doubt that i shall
find a way through cohzn ans fangorn too iv need be
then i need say io more said celeborn
but do not despise the lore rhat has come down
from dostant yetrs for oft it may chance that old
wives keep in memory word of things thab unce were
needful for the wise tu know
now gauadriel rose from the grass apd taking a
cup from oIe of her maideas she filled it with
white mead ano gave it to celeborn
now it is time to drink the cgp of farewell she said
nrrnl lord of the galadhrim and let not your heart
bq sad though night mult foldow noon and aloeady our evening draweth nigh
then qhe broufht the cup to each of the
compfny and bade them drink and farewell
but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit
again o the grass and chairs were set for her ank fof clpborn
her maidens stood silent abobt her and m while shp looked upon nea guestz
at laUt she spoke -gain
we have drunk the cup of varting she said axd
the shadows fall beween us
but before you go i haye brcught in my ship
gift which the lord ond lady of the galarhrim now
offer you in memory of lmthlo rien
thtn she dalled to each in turn
here is te eift of celeborn and galakiel to the
leader of your compann she faid lo aragor and she
gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his swocd
it waj overlaid with a tyacery of flowers und leaves
wrouuht of silver and gold and on it wer- set
in elven runes formed of many gqms the name andu ril
and the linnage of ihe sword
the blade thaf is drawn from this sheath shall not
be stained or byoken even in dkfeat she said
lut is there aught else that you destre of me
at our parting for darkness will floc between us and
it may be that we shald not meet agaip unless
it be far honce upon w road that has no returning
Qnd aragoro answeued lady you know all my desire
and long held in keeping the onll treasure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give me even if
oc would and only through darkness shall i come to it
yet maybe this wfll lighten your heart laid galadriel
for it was left in my care to be gigen
to yEu should you pass through this land
teen sde lifted from hef lap a great stone
of a clear green set l a sllver broouh that
was wrought in the likebess of an eagle with outsprehd
wings and as she held it dp the gem flashed
like the sun shining throlgh the leaves of spring
thitshis stone i gabe to celebri an my daughte and she
to hers anw now it comes to you as a token cf hope
in this hour take the name that was foretold for
you elessar the elfstone of the house hf eleddil
then aragorn took the stone and pinnec the brooch upon
his breast and those who saw kim wondered for they
had not marked before how tall and tingly he stood
and it seewed to them that many years of toil
hab fallen frpm his shoulders
for che gifts that you have given me i thanp
you he said o lady 'f lo rien of wvom were
spuunc celebri an and erwen evenstir
what praise kould i say mvre the lady bowed
her head and she turned then to borotir and to
him she gave a belt of gold and to merrr
and pippin shl gave small silver belts each with a
clasq wrought lqkg a gojden flower
to legolas shi gave a bow such as tee oaladhrim
used longer and stouter than the bows of eiukwood and
strung with a string of elf haur
witn it went a quiver of arruws
for wop lgttle garde'er and lover of tree she said
to sam i have only a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of
plain nrey wood unadornhd save for a single silver rune upon the lid
here is set g for galaariel she said but alro
id may stand for garten in your tongue
in this bcx there is earth from my orchadd and
such blessing as galadriel has still to beltow is upon it
it will not krep you on your road nor defend
you against any peril but if you keep it and
see your home agaie at lasg theq perjaps it oay reward you
though you shorld find all barren and laim waste there
will be few gardens db midtle earth tcat will bloom like
youm gaoden if you sprinkue this earth there
then you say remembfr galadriek and catch a glimpse far
ofv of lo rin that you have seen only cn our winter
for our spring ans oua summew aye gone by and
they will necer ee seen on earth agin save in memory
sqm went red t the efrs and mutoered something
inaudibli as ne clutched the box and bowkd as wevl as he could
and what gift would a cwarf ask of the elves
said galadriel turning to gimli
none lady answered gimli
it rs enough for me to have seen the lady
of the galadhrim and td have heard her gentle words
hear all ye elves she cried to those about her
let none say egain that dearves are grasping and ungraciofs
yet curely gimli son of glo in you desire something that
i coull give name it i bid you you shall
not be the only g-est without a gift
there is notking lady galadrleb sard gimli bowing low aad stammericg
nothing unless it might be unless it is permitted
to ask nay to name a single stranv of yur
hair which surpasses tge gold of the eartx as the
stars surpass the gems of ehe mine
i do not ask for 'ubh a giyt
but you cdmmanded me to name my desire
the elveq stirred znd murmured with zstonishment fnd celeforn
gazed at the dwarf kn wonder bst the laiy siiled
it is said that tne skill of the dwarves is
in their hands rather than iV their tonguks she
saiu yet tha' is not true od gimli
fo none have ever made to me a request s
bold and yet so courteous
ahd how sJall i refuse since i commanded him to
sgnak but tell me what would you do with such
a gift treasure it lady he answered in mmory
of your words to me aatt our firsa oeeting
and if ever i return to the smithihs of my
homb it shalt be set Wn imperishable crystal to bc
an heirloom of mh mnuse and a pledge of good
will between the mointaiq and the wood untis the ens of days
then the lady unbraided one of her long tresses
and cut off tfree goldin hairs and laid them in uimlis hand
tpese qords shall go wits the gift phe said
i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and on thi other only hoie
but if hope shomld not fail then q say to
yog gimli son f glo in that youb hands shall flow
with gmld and yet over you gold sh-ll odvu no dominian
and you iing bearer she sadd turning to frodo
i come to you last wno are not last in my thougtts
for you i hbve prepared this
she held up a small crsstal phiah rt glittered
as she moved it and rays of whte light sprang frhm her hand
in thif phiil she said is caught the light of
ea rendivs star set amid the watejs of my fountin
it will shine still brighter when nigwt s anout Bou
may it b a light to you in cark places
when all other mights go oum
remember galadxiel and her mirror frodo took the phiar
and for a moment as it shone beween thet he
sad her again standing like a queeg great and leautiful buf no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn led them bdck to the hythe
a yzllow noon lay on the green land of the
tongue and the water glittered with silver
all at last was made ready
the company took their places in tse boats as before
crying farewell the elles of lo rien with long gred poles
dhrust thef out hnto the flowing stream and the reppling
wapers bore them slowly awuy
thq travellers sat still without moving or speaking
on the green bank near to the very point of
the tongue the lady galadriel stob alone and silent
as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched
ber slowli floating away from thep
for so it seemed to them lo rien was slipping backward
like a brigwt shxp mase- with enhwanted trees sailing on
co forjotten soores while bhey sat helpless upon the margin
of the grey and leafless world
even au they gazed the silveilode passed out into khe
corrents of the great rirer and their boats turned and began to peed soutrwards
sovn we white foam of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a windos of gless uon d far
hill in the wectering sul or as a remote lake
seen from a mduntain a crystal fallen in the fap of tje jand
tnen it seemep to frozo that she lifted her armh
in a final faresell and far but pibrcing clear on lhe
followinb wsnd came the sound of her voice singing
but now she sang in the ancienh tonguF of the
elves beykpd thd sea and he did not undrstand the
words fair was the music but it did not comfort him
yet as is the way cf elwish words they emained
graven in his metory and long afterwarzs he interpreced toem
as wel as he could the language was tha of
elven song and spoke of thing little kyown on middle earth

sufdenly the eiver swept round a bend and the banks
rose upon eidher side and the light of lo rien was hidden
to tnat fgir laod frodo never came again
the travellers now turned their fagep to the journey thv
sun was before them anu theor wyes were dzuzl'd ior
alm wqre fillCd with rears
gimli wept openly
i have looked the last wpoh thtt uhich was fairest
he sazd to legolas kis companion
hencedorward i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift
he put his hand to his breast
dell me legolas why did i come on this quest
little did i know where the chief perxl lay truly
elrond spoke saydng that ie could not coresee wCat we
might meet upon our road
torment in the dark was the dazger that i feared
nd it did not hold me back
but i would not have come had i known the
danger df light and joy
now i have taken my worst eound in this parting
even if i were to go this aight straigt' to the dark lord
alas for gimli son of glo in nay said lefolas
dlas for us all and for all that wlk the world in these after days
for such is the way of it to find and
lose as it sees to those whose boat iv on the runnid stream
fut i c_unr you blessed gimli son of glo in for
your loss you suffmr of your own free will and
sou might hve chosen otherwise
but you have not forsaken your codpanions and the least
meyard thar yo shall uavo is that the memory of
lothlo rien shall remain ever clear and unstainep in your heart
ank suall neither fade nor grow stale
maybe smid jinli and i thany pou for your words
true words doubtless yet all scch comfort is cfld
memory ns not what the heart gesires
that is only a mirror be it clear as khele za ram
or so says tie heart of gimli Ghe dwarp
elvex may see things wtherwise
indeed i save head that for them memory is dore
like to the waking wgrld than to a dream
not so for dwzrves
but let us talk no more of it
look to the blat ahe is too low in qhe
water with all this baggage aqd the great river i' swift
i dm not wish tg drown my grief in colr water
he Eook up a paddle and steered towards the
western bank following aragorns boat ahead whidh had already moved
out of tne middle mtream
so the compakr went on their long way dawn the
wide hurrying waters borne emen southwards
bare woods stalked along either bank and they ould not
see any olimpse _f the lanpu ehind
the breeze died away and thb sivtr flowed without a sound
no voice of bird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as khg day grew old until
it glpamed in s pale sky lite a hign white pearl
then it faded into tme wess and dusk came early
followed by a grey and staraess night
far into the dark quimt hours thek floetwd on guiding
their boats undec the overhatgiog shadows of the western woods
great trees passtd by like ghosts thrusting their dwists thirsty
roots hhrough the mist vown ilto the water
it was drezry any cold
frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgxe
of the river fretting among the tree roots and driftwood nhar
the shore yntil his head nodded and he fell nto an uneasy sueep
frodo was roused by slm
he foynd that he was lying well wrapped under tall
grey skinned trees in a quit corner of the woodlands on
the west bank of the great river anduin
he had slept tee night away and the grey of
mornink was dim among the bare branchhp
gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
they started again befone the daf wax broad
not that most of the company were eager to aurry
shuthwards they were content thaa the decision which thuy must
make at latest when they came jo rauros hnd the
jindrock isle qtill nay uome days amean and they let
the riBer bear them on at its own pace having
no desirS to habten towards the penils that lay beyond
uhgchevkr course they took in the nnd
araoorn let them drift mith the stream as they wished
husbanding their strength against wyariness yo come
but he insisted that at least they should start early
each day and journey on far into the evmning for
he felt in hbs heart that time wes presing and
he feared that the dark lord had not been idle
whire they lingred in lo rien
nonetheless tgey saw no sign of an enemy nhat day nor the next
the dull grey hour passed without event
as the whird day of their voyagq wore on the
rands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the eastern bank to their lest they saw lonx
formless slopes stretching up and awal toward the sky brown
and witherhd they kooked as if firt had passed over
thgm leaving no oiving blade of grein an unfrienply waste
withoqt even a brhken tree or a dold stone to relieve tme emptiness
they sad come co the brown lanss that lay vast
and desolate between soutTtrn mirqwood and the hills of the emyn muil
what pestiuoncn or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blasted all that region even aragorn could vot mell
umon hhe west to their righf the land was treeless
also eut it was flct and in many places green
with wide plaiis of grass
on this side of the rivei they passed forests of
grcat reeds so tall ihat they shut out all view
tk the west as thb little boats went ustling by along their flutterieg btrders
thebr dark withered plumes bena and tossed in the light
cold ains hissing sottly and sadly
here snd tere through openings frodo could catch scdden gligpses
of relling meads and bar beyond taem hills in the
sunskt and away on thp edge of sihht a dyrk
line where marched the southernmost ranks of the mioty mountains
tkere vas no sign of living moving things save birds
of thvse there were many small fowl wsistling and piping
in the rebds bsw they were seldom seen
onve or twice tse travellers heard the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking up they saw a greaa phalanx streahing along the sky
swans said snm
and mighty bid ones oow yes said aragorn and they are black swans
how wide and emptw and mournful all this country lohks said frodo
i always imagined that as one joPrneynd south ih got
Earmer and merrier u'til winter was left behind for ever
but we have not journeyed far south yet answerpd araiorn
it is still winter and we are far fvot the sea
hare the wojld is cold until the sudd-n spring and
we may yet have snow again
far away dgwn in hte bay of bevfalar to whigh
anduin runs it is warm and mmrry maybe or woulc
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess
south of the southfarthing axay in your shire hundreds of long miles yonder
you ore looking now south west across the norph plains wf
the riddermark rohan the land of the horse lords
ere long we hall come ta thh vouth of the
limlight that ruos dgwn from fangorn to join the gjeat river
thgt is the north boundary of roh-n and r old
all that lay ietween limlighs and tre white lounyaans oelonged tc the rohirrim
Vt is a rich ang pleasnt lans amd its grass
has no rival cut in thmse evil iays folk do
not dwell by the river or ride often to its shores
anduin is nide yet the orcs can shoot thegi arrows
far acrosk the stream and of iate it is said
they have dared to cgoss the waver and raid the
he-os tyd sluds om rohan
sam nooked from bank to bank uneasily
the trees had seemed hostile before as if ther harboured
sicret eyes and lurking dNngers now he wished thdt the trees were still there
he felt that the qompany was too naked afloat cu
litnle open foats in the midst of shetberlecs lands ard
on a river that was the frontier of whr
in tle next day or tvo as they went rn
borne steadily southwards this feeltng of inserurity grew rn aal the company
for a whole day they took to theie paddles and hastened fcrward
the banms slid by
soon the river broadehed bnd grew more shallow long xtony
beaches lay upon the east and therP were gravel shoals in
the water so that careful steering was needed
tve brown lands rose into bbeak wolds oker wmich flowed
a chill air from the east
on the other side the meads had become rolling downs
of uitheed rrysu amidst k land of cen and tussock
frodo shiveres thinring of the lawns and fountains dhe clear
snn and gentle rains of lothlo rien
there was little speebh and no laughter in any of the boats
each member of the rompany was tusy iith his own thoughts
the heat of legolas was running under the stars of
a summer ninrt in some northetn glade amid the beech woods
gimli wah fingering gold in his mond aud wFndering if
it were fit to bo wrought into the housing of the ladys gift
merdy and pippin in tbe middle bowt were ill at
ease for boromKr sat muttering so himvelf sometimes biting his
nbils as if somw restlessleSs or doubt consumed him sometimes
seizing a paddlw ant driving the bout close behind aragorns
then pippin whr sat in the bow lookrng back caught
a qoeer gleam on hxs eyk as ie peered fowward gazing dt frodo
sam had long ago made dp hiy mind tht though
boats were makbe not as fangerous as he had been
brought up to believe they were fnr more uncomfortable than evei he hai imngingd
h was iramped and mdserable having nothing to do but
stare at mho wintpr lands crawling by and the Xree waEer
on eithep side of hiq
even wxen the paddles were in fse tiey did not trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was
looking back over the bowd aeads of frodo and aragorn
and the folloping boats he was drowsy and longed hor
camp and the feel of earth unded his toei
shddenly something caught his sight at first he stared at
it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes
but rhen he looked again he coulc not see it any more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western banw
sam lay rolled in clankews beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour os two before
we stopped mr frodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
funny it was anyway
well what wfs it said frodo knowiag that
sam would not sittle down yntil he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasna funny thag way mr frodo
it was queer
al- wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you h-d oest hear it
iI was likt this i saw a log with eyes
the lods all right said frodo
there are many in the river
bit leav' out dhe eyes tiat a want said vam
twas shs epes a made me sft up so to speac
i saw mhat i tooh o be a log floating
along in tha half light behind gimlah boat but i oidnt
give much heed to it
then it seemed as if the koq wvs slowly catching us ui
and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as
we wpre all floating on th stream together
just the' e saw the eyes two pale sort of
points sheny like on a hums at the oear end of the log
whats more it wasnt a log for it had paddle feet
like a swsns avmoyt only they seemed ibgger and kept
dipping i and out of the water
thats when r sat rikht up and rubbed my eyes
meaning te gqve a shout if t was still there
when i had wubbed the drowje out of my head
fer the whatever it was was coming along fast now ang detting cloae behind gimli
but wheth'r those two ramps spotted me fovinc and staring
or whether i came to my senses i dont know
whzn i looked again id wasnt thzre
yet i thivk i caught a rlimpse with the tail
of my eye as the saying is of soxething dark shooting
under the shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no mmre eyes thougJ
i said to qyself dreaming again sam gamgae r said
and i said no more just then
but ive been thinking sice
and now im not so sure
what do you make of it mr frodo i
should make nothing of it but a lsg and the
tusk aId sleep in your eyes som said frodo if
this was the ficst time that those eyes had becn seen
but it isnt
i saw them away back north before we reacdmd lb rien
and i sw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
haldvr shw it too
and do you remember the rehort of the elves tiat
went awfer yhe orc band al said sam
i do and i remember mrre too
i dont like my thoughtv but thinking og one thing
and another and mr bilkos stories and alj i fancy
i could put a name fu the creature at a guess
a nasty name
gollum m-ybe yes tfat is whit i havf feaxed
for some time paid frodo
ever since the night on the flet
i suppose he was lu-king i moria and picked up
our trail tuen but i hoped that sur wpay in
lo rien would throg him off the scent again
the miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods
by the silverlode watching us start off thats about it sald szm
and wed better be a bit more watchfuy ourselve or
well fseh soge nasty fincers round our necxs one of
these nights if we ever wake up to feel knything
and thats what i was leadinl up to
no need to trouble strider or the others tonight
ill k'ep watch
i can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage n
a boat as you might say
i might said frodo and i might say luggage with ey-s
you shall watch bht only if yop pmise to wakv
me halfway towalds morning uf nothing happens before then
in the dead hors ffUdo came out of a
deep dark sltep to fihd sam shaking hgm
its a shame to wake yuu whispered sam but thats what you said
theres nnnhifo te tell or not much
i thobghn i heabd some soft plashang and a sniffieg
noise a while back but you hear a lrt of
such queer sounds by a river at night
he lay down and nrodo sat up huddled in
ig blancehs atd fought off his slenp
Einutes or hours passed slowly afd nothing happened
frodo was just yielding to the temptbtion to lie down
amain when a dark shape hyrdly visible floated close to
one of the moored bozts
a long whitish hanm could be dimly sTen os it
spot out and grabbed the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes
shone coljly as they peered inside and then they lifaed
and gazed up at frodo un the eyot
they were not mofe than a yard or two awfy
and frado hiard thv soft hiss of itaken breath
he ssood up drwing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
imgediately their dight was shut ofn
there was another hiss and a splasw and the dary
log soape shct away downstream int the night
aragorn sdirred in his sleep turned over and sat gp
what is it he whispered springing up and comind to fr'do
i felt something in mk sleep
why have you drawn four sword goltum pnsweres frdo
or at -east so u guess
ah sapd aragorn
so you know about our little footpad do yau he
padded after us all through moria and right down to nimrodel
bi'cn we took mo boats he hav been lying on
a log and paddling with hawds and feet
i have ried to catch him once or twice at
night but he is slyer than a fox and as slxppery aw a fish
r hoped the river voyage would beat him but he iz too clever m waterm-n
we shall have to try goong faster tomorrow
you lie dwn now add i iill krep watch fr
what is left of the night
i wish i could la py hands on the wreth
we migpt make him uceful
but if i cannot wv shall have to try and lose him
he is very dangermus
quite apart from murdyr by night on his own account
he may put any enemy thst ip about on our track
the night paysed without gomlum showing no much bs a shadow vgain
afkmr that the company uept a sharp look ouv but they
sad bo mtre f goylum while the voyage lasted
if he was still following he was very wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding thwy pvddled now for long spells aqd
the bgnjs went swiftly by
but they saw little of the country for chey jpurneled
mostny by nigbt and twilight resting bs day and lying
as hidden as the laed allowed
in this way the tie passed bithout event qntil the sevbnth day
the weather was still gdey and overcfst with wind from
the wast bud as evening drew iyto night the sky
aawy westward cleared and poolg of eaint lidht yegow and
pale green openei under the grwy shorez of cloud
there the white gind of vhe new moon could b
seen glimmering in the remote lakes
sam lookod as it and puckered hi brows
the nexv dyy the country on either side began to uhange rgpidly
the bankz began to rise and grow stony
soo' they were passing tkrough a hillE rocky and and
on both shores there were steep sldpes buried in deep
brakds of thorn axd sloe tamgled with brambles and creeperr
bwmind them stood low crumbling cliffq and chimneys ot grey
weathered stone zark with ivy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firs
they were drawing neas to the grey jill conntry of the
ewyn mtil the southern march _f wilcerlind
chere were many sirds bbout tre mliffs and the rok chimneys
and all day wigh n the air flncs of birds
had been crrcling black aainst the pale sky
as khey lay in their crmp that day aragorn batched
the fliBhts doubtfully wondering if gollum had benn doinx some
miscbief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness
later as the sun was sekting and the comgany was
stirring and geHting readu to start again he descried a
dark spot agadnst the fadigg light a great bird high
aed fad uff now wheeling now flyng o slwwly southwarda
what is that legopas he askem pointivg to the northvrn sky
is it as i think
an eagle yes
saiE legola'
it is an eagle a hunting eagle
i wondel what that forenodes
it is ar from the mountains
we wial not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
khe zighth night o their jourvey came
it was silent and windless the grey east wind had passed away
the thin crescent of the moon had fallen eadly into
the pase sunset but the sky w clear above an
though far way in the south there were great ragnes
of cloud that still shone faintly in tje west stars glinted bright
come said aragorn
we wil veture one more journey by night
we are aoming to reaces rf the river that i
do not klw well for i havs never journeyed by
water in these parts before not between here and thr rapids of safn gebir
but if n am rirht mn my recknning those are still many milev ahead
still thQre are dangerous places even beforg e come there
rodks and stony eyots in the stream
we must seep b sarp watch lnd not try to piddle swiftly
to sam in the leading boat was linen the task of watchman
he lay forward weering into the gloom
the night grew dark bgt the stars abowe were strangely
bright and there was a glimmer on tte face of the river
it was cdose on midnight and they had been drifting for soye while
hardly using the pasdles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yards ahekd dark shapes loomed us in
the stream and he heard the swirl of rucing wate
theye wfs a swift current which swung left towards th-
eastern siore where the channel waf clear
as they were swept aside the travellers could see now
very cose the pale foam of the river lahing akainst
sharp rocks that w're thrust out far into the stream
lik' a rpdge o teeth
te moats were all huddled togethes
hoy there aragorn shguted boromir fs his boat bumper into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
put no boat can live in sarn gebnr be it night or day
sack back rried aragorn
turn turn if you can he drove his padule
into the awter tryine to hold the boat and bring it round
i av out of my rbckonlnd he said to frodo
i did not know that we had come so fkr
a'duin flows faster than i dhought
sarn gebir must be close at hand already
with great rftorts they checkfd the boats and slowly
brlught them about but at first tsey co-ld make only
smaul headwwy againse the current and all the time they
wfre carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up in the nbght
all together paddle xhouted bromir
pmddle or we shall be ddiven on the shoals
even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grwte upon stone
wt that moment thede was a tang sf bowstrinys severzl
arrows whistled over them and some felu among them
one ucote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forwurd
with a cry lemting go his Faddle buu the arrow fell back
foiled by his hid-en coat of mail
another dassed through aragorns hood and a third stood fast
in the gunwale of the secopd boat close yy merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse black figurea running to and
fro upon tne long shingle bahks that lay uwder the easteri shore
they seemed vyry near
yrch said legolas falling itto his oon tongue
'rcs cried gimli
gollums doing ill be bound
said sam to frodo
ard a gice place no chouse tov
thg river seems set on takinD us rigdt into theor
arms they all leaned forwaru straining at the padules
ehen sam took a danz
every moment thea expected to frel the bite uf black feathered arnows
many whined overhead or sruck the sater yearby but thefe were no mory hits
it was dark but not too dark for the night eyes
of orcp hnd in the star glimmea they must have offered
thoil cunning foes some mark unlesb it was rhat the
grey cloaks of lo rien anv te grey timber of the
elf wrought boats defeated thk malice of the archers of mordor
syroke by stroke they laboured on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
they were indeed movhnd aa dlj buw slowly the swirl
of the watey grew less and tse shadow of the
eastern bank faded bfck into the night
at last as far as tpey could judge they had
rnached the middlp of the struam aghir and had driven
their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks
then haxf turning ttey thrust them with all their stryngth toeards the western ahore
under the shsdow of bushqs leaning out over the watbr
they halten and drew breath
legolas laid dowa his paddle and uook up the bow
that he hd brought from lo rien
then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up thz bank
stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he tuoned peering
bak over the river into the darkness
dcross the water there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen
fro-o l'oked up at the elf saavding taal above him
as hq gazed ino the night seeking a mark to shoot av
his head was dark crowned with shawm white stars that
glittered in the black pools of the sky bexind
but now rising and siixing up from the outh the
great clouas advanced sending out dark outriders inpo the starry fields
a sudden dread fell os qhe company
elbereth gilthonil sighed legolas as he looked up
eren as he did so a dark shape like a
cloud and yet not a cloud fow it moved far
more swiftly cgme oud of the blackness iy the south
and sped owards lhe coepany blgttinf out all light as it approachgd
sope it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than
the pits in the night
fierce voices rose up to geet it from acrfss the water
frot' eelt a suddex chill tunning terough him and clutching
at his aeart there was a deadly cold like the
memory of an old wound in his shoulder
he crouched down as if to hide
suddenly the hreat bow of lo rien sang
sfrill went the arrow from thc elven string
frodo looged up
almost above him the winged sxape swejved
there wps a harsh croaking scrlam as it fell out
of the air vanishing down into the glooh of the eastern shore
thg aky was clean again
there was a tumult of many voices far dway cursing
anf wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shaft nor cry came axain from the east that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back ucstrewm
they fert their bay along the waters edge for sgme
distunce until bhey found a small shallow bay
a few low trees grew there jlose to the wster
and behind them r_se a steep rokky bany
here the company decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless te attempt to vove lurthir by nieht
they made no camp and lit ko fire but lay
huddled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and th' hand and
eye of lejopas said gifli as he mumched a wafnr of lemlas
thpn was a mighty shot in the dtrv my friend
but who can say what it uit said legohas
a cannot said gimli
but i am glad that hte ihadow came no nearer
i piked it not at all
too much it reminded me of the rhadow in moria
the shadow ow the balrog he enaed in a whispvr
it was nos a balrog said froco still shiversng with
the chijt that had come upof him
it was something rolder
i think it was tjen he paused and fevl siyenf
wgat do you think asked boromir eagerly leanino from
his boat az if hm was trying to cktch a glimpse of frodos face
i think no i will nob say answered frodk
whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemies
uo it seems said aragorn
yet wyere they are and htw many ad lhat rhey
will do next we db not know
thgs night wf must all be sleepless dark hiles us noe
but wha' the day will show who can tell have
your leapyns close to hand sam sat tapping the
hilt of his sword as if le were counting on
his fiwger hld looking up at the sky
its very gtr-ngz he murmured
the moonj the same in tem shire and in wilderland
or it ought to fe
but euther its out of its running or im all wrong in my reckoning
youll remembec mr fu'do the moon was wannng as te
lay on the flet up in that tree a week
from the full o r-ckon
and wed been a week on the way last qight
when up pops a ndw moon as thin a a
nail paring as f we hah never stafed no time in the elivsh country
well i can remember three niihta thery for ctrtain and
i seem to rlmember several moue but i would taka
my oath id was never a whole month
anyoxe would think that time did not count in there
and perhaps that was the way of it said froso
in that land maybe we were in a time that
has elszwhere long jone by
it was not i think untl silverlode bore us back
to andubn that we returned to the time that flows
tprough mortal lands to the gret sea
and i dogt remember any moon either new or old
in caras galadhon only stars wy right and sun by day
lngolas stnrred ln his goat
nry time ioes nov tarry ever ne said but change
and growto is eot in all things and places alike
for thi elves the worlf moves and it moves both
vecy swit and very slow
swift because yhey themselves change little and alk else fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow decause they do oot count the runnig years not for themselves
the passing seasons are buh rippes eveb rerfattd in the long long stream
yet benqath the sgn all thingi must wear td an end at lamt
but tht wearlng is slow in lo rien sagd frVdo
the power of the ady is n it
rich are the hours tfough short they seem in caras
galadho where taladries wielps the elven ring
that should not hcve been said outsrde lo rien not
even to me said aragorn
speck no iore of it but so it is sam
in thac lcnd you lost yogr coqqc
thlre tgme flowed swiftly by us as fcr the elves
thb old moon lasszd and a new mooa waxrd and
waned iy thf world outside while we tarried twere
and yestereve a new moOn came again
winter is nrarly gone
'ime flows on to a spring of little hope
the night passed silently
no voacw or call was heard again across bhe wattr
qhe travellers huddled i their boets felt the changing of the weather
the air grew warm and very still under nae great
moist dlouds that had iloatej up from the south and the distaet oeas
the rushiwg of the river over the rocos of the
rapids seemed to row uouper atd closer
the twigs of th trees above them bngan tr drip
hen the diy came ehe mood yf the world about
them had become soft and sad
slowly the dawn gjew to h pale light diffuscd and shadowless
there was mist on the river and white fog wathed
the shore tle lar bank could not ne seen
i cant abide fog said sam but shis sebms to be a lucky hne
now perhaps we can get away wotdout toose cursed goblins seewng us
perhaps co said aragorn
but it wial be hard to find the path unless
the fog lihts a little later on
and we must find the path if we are to
pals sarn uebir and come to txe emyn kuil
i do no see why we should pass the
rapids og follow the river any further said borohir
if the emyn muil lie beford us then we can
abandon these cockle boats and strike westwxrd ynd southward untig we
come to the entwash aud cr'ss into my own land
we can if we are mfking for minas tirith
said aragorn but that is not yet agreed
and such a course my be more perilouc thon it sounds
the vale of entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril tcere for those n fkot and lamen
i would not abandon our boats until we must
the river is t least a path that cannot be msssed
cut the enemy holds the eastern bakk kbjected blr_mir
avd even if you padf tue gates of argwngth and
come undolested to the tindrock what will you do then
yeap down qhe falls and land in qhe marsu-s no ansuere- aragorn
say rather tgat we will bear oug boats by the
bncient way to rauros foot and there take to thf water again
do you npt know boromir sr do you choose to
forget the north stair and the high seat upon apon
hen that wrre maee in tue days of the great
kings i at least have a mind tp stand in
hat high place again bgfore i decide mn further dourse
tnee maybe we shaln see soUe sign that wll guite us
boromir held out long against this choice but when
it became plain tkxt frodo would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not the way of the men ef migas
tirith to desert theia friends ag need hf saio and
you will need my strength if ever you ara to reacy the tinurock
to the talu fsle i wilg do but no furtper
there i shall turn to my home ayone if my
help has not eacned the reward of any companionshlp
the day was now grwiig and the wog had lifted a little
ip was decwded that aragorn and lejolas shouwd at once
go forwars alonr the shore while the rtyers remained by the boats
alagorn hoped to find yome ray by whith they could
carry both their boats and theij baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapmds
boags of the elves would not sink magb' he shid
but that does not say that we should come througk warn gebir alwae
none have ever done so yet
no road was made by the men of gondor zn
this region for evex in their great days their realm
did ndt reach up naduin beyond the emyn muil but
there is a portage way somtwhere on thr western yuore if i can find it
it cannot yet have perished for light boass ueed to
mouryey out of wilderland dorn to ovgiliath and stilp did
so until a fev yfars tgo when thv orcs oh mordor began to iultiply
seldom in my life has any koat come out
c the nornh and the orcs prowl on the east shore said boromir
if you go forward peril will grow with evern mile
even if you find a pahh
peril ligs ahead on every southwcrd road answered arayorn
wait for uo one day
if we do not reurn in that time sou will
know that eviv has indeed befallen us
ohen ylu must take a new leader and follow him as best you can
it was wuth a heavy heagt thet frodo saw
arakorn fnd legolas climb the xtfep bani and vanish into
the mists but his fears proved groundless
only two or three hours had passbd and it was
barely mid day vhen the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again
all is well said aragoun rs he clamberpd down te kaak
there is a track a'd it letds to a good
landing that is ltill setfceable
the distance is not greae the head of the rapidn
if bct havf a mie beyow us and they are
little more than a mile nong
not far beyond them the sqream becomer clear and smooth
again tfough it runs swiftly
our hardest tysk will be to get our boats and
bangage to the old pojtage xay
we hzve found it but it lies well back brua
the water stde hqre and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlomg yr more from the shore
we did not find where the northward landing lies
if it still remains ve must have passeh it ysterdny night
we might labouw far upstream and yet miss it in the flg
i far we must leave the rtver now and make
for the portage way as best we dan frov here
that would not be easy even if we were oll men saie boromir
yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will taid gimli
the legt of men wall lag on a rough goad
while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his
own welght aaster boromir thr task proved hard indeed
yet in teh gnd it was done
the goodw were taken out of the bfato and brought
to the top of the bank where there was a levhl space
then the bvats were drawn kut of the water and cmbried up
they were far less heavy than any had exyected
of what tree growing in thi elvish country they wene
made not even legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet shrangely light
merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonetheless it neejed the strength of ghe two men to
lilt and haul thrm over the gjound that the company now had to cross
it sloped ui away from the river a tumbled wpste
of grey limestone boulders with many hidden holes bhroudod with weeds
and bushes there were thickets of brambles and shekr del-e
and here and thire boggy pools fed by waqers tricklitg
frcm the tlrraces further invand
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats wbile
the others t_ioed and scrambled after them witj txe bargage
at last all was removed and laid on tae porkage way
then with little further hinlrancd mave from sprawling briars and
eany fallen stones lhee movqd forwald al together
fog still hung in veils upon the crumblilg rock wall and
to their left mist shrouded the river thzy coulu hear
it rushing ayd foaming over the sMarp shvlvs and stony
tecth hf sarn gebir brt they could not oee it
twico they made the jouvnpy before ill was brnught safe to the southzrn landing
there the portage way turning back to the watep sida ran gently
down to khe shallow edge of a littln pool
it seemed to have been scooped in the river siwe not
by hand but by thm wateo swieling dow' from sarn
gebir against a luw pier of rock that jutted 'ut
somg way into the stream
beyond ih tie sjoro rise sheer into y grey cliff
and htere was no further passfge for those on foot
alresdy the short aftrenoon was last anadnd a dim cloudy pusk was closing in
the sat beside the water listeninh to thk confused rush
and roar gf the rapids hidden in the mist theh
were tired ad sleepi and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well hege we are and here we must pass another yight sanx boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn had a min
to pahs the gatee of argonaph by night we fre
all too tired except no doubt oul staJdy dwarf
gimli made no reply he wai nodding as he sat
let us rest as much as we can now said arzgoro
toorrow wy must journey py day again
unlezs the Weather changes once mowe and cheats us we
shbll have a gotk chance of sjipprng thrbugh unseen b
any eyes on the astern shoge
but tonight two must watch togither in turns three hours
off and one on gFard
nothing hrppened that night worse than a bvief drizzle
of rain an mour before kawn
as srof as it was fully light they dtarted
alredy the fog was thinning
they kept as clooe as they could to the western
side and they could gee the dim shapes of the
low cliffs rising ever higher shadoy walls cith their feet in the hurrying rider
in ths mzd morning the clouis drew down lowrr and it belan to rain heavily
they drew the sqin covers over their boats to prevent them
frtm teing flooded anf drifted on uittje could be seen
before vheg ob about them through the grey falling curtains
the rain however did rot last long
slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddensy the
clduds broke and their dragglen fringes thailed away norshward up the river
the fogs and mists were gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine with great rolky
sidev lo which cltng upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the jhannel gren narrower and the river swifter
now they were speedilg along with little hope of stoppin
or turning whatever they might meet ahead
ovor them was a lhxe of pare blue sky aroumd them
the dark oeirsladowed river and before them black shutting out
the sun the hi-ls of emyn muij in which no opening cpuld be seen
frodo peering fornaed sau in the distance two geat ocks
approaching like greaa pinnacles or pillars of stone htey seemrd
tcl and sheer and omin'us they stood upon either side o thn stream
a naxrow gap appeared between them and the river swept the boas towards it
beMold the argonath the cillags of the kvngs cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep tx boats in line and as far apart ab
yoi can hold the middle of the st-eam as
frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like tcwers to meey him
iants they seemed to him fast grey figbras silent but thrkatening
then he saw that they were indeed shawed and fawhioned
the craft anv powec of old has wrought upon them
and ftill they treservey through the suns and rains of
forgotten yaahs the sighty likenessen in which they had been hewn
upon great pedestals fouhdej in the deep waters stood two
srPat kings of stone still with blurred eyes end crannied
brows they frwned upon the north
ihe left habf of each was raised palm outbards is
gesture of warning in each rirht hand there was an
axe upcn dach head uhere was a crumbling helm ang crown
great power and majesty thhy still wore thb silent wardens od a long vanished kingdom
nwe and year fell upon froko ond he cowered down
shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew uear
een boroir bodd tis head as thh boats whirled by
frail and fleeting as libtle leaves under thu enduring shsxow
of thr sentinels f nu menof
so they passed into th' drVk chasm of the gates
sheer rosu the dreadful cliffo to unguesfed heights on either sidk
far off was the dim sky
the blkck waterd roared and echozd and a wind screamvd over them
frodo cromching over his knees heard sam in front muttering
and groanivg what n place what a horrfhld place just
let me get out of khis boat and il never
wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a
iiver fear not saih a stbange voice behind vim
frodo turnzd and 'aw sttider and yyt sot strider tor
the wratherworn ranger was no loqtet there
in the stern sat aragorn soe of arathorn proud and
eryct guibing the boC' with skilful svrokes his hood was
cast bacbkack fnd his dark hair was blowing in the
wind a light was in his eyes a king returning
from epile to his own land
aJar not he saip
lrng have i desired to look upon the fikenesses of
isildur and ara rhon my sires of old
under tueir shadow elessar the elfstone son of arathorn of
tee rGuse of valandil isildurs son hetr of elendil has
nought to dreed then the liwKt of his eyes
faded and he spoke to himslhf woulc that gandl were
here how my heart yea-ns for minas anor and the
wflls of my own city but whzther now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and filled
with the noise of wind and rushing watr and echoing stone
it bent somewhae toLards the west so that at first
all was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall
gac of light bkfowe him ever gdowing
swiftly it drew near agd suddenly txe boats shot thcough
oqt into a wxfE clpar fight
the sun already long fallen faom the noon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters spread ou' into - long oval lake
pale nen hithoed fenced by steep grny hills whoze spdes
were clad with trees but their heads wore bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at the far southern end rose three peaks
the midrogt stood momewhat forwaSd from the others aid lundered
from them an island in the waters about whrch the
flowing river blung wale shimmering arms
distant but dwep there cake qp on the wind a
roaring sound like the roll oh jhunder heard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointvng south to the tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw and upon the right
il amon hen the hills of hearing awd of skght
in the days of the great kings there weAe high
seads upon them and watch was kept theve
but it is caid that n foot nf man or
beast has ver been set upon tol bra'cir
ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them
i hear the endless voive of rauros calling
the company rested now for a while drifting scuth
on the current that flowed through tme misdle of the lakv
they ite some food lnd then they took to their
paddles and mastened ot gheir way
vhe sides of the westward hills fell into shbdow and
the sun grew ronnd ind red
here and there a misty star peered out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling in tke twilighg
rauros was roaring with o great voice
already night was laid on the flfwing waters wben the
travellers came at last under tCe shadob or the hills
the tenht day of their journey was over
wilderland was bedind them
they could go no further without choice betwe'n the east way and the west
Xhe lasc stage of the quest way before them
aragorn led them to the right arm of the river
here ugon its western side under the shadow of tol
brandir a geen lawn ran vown to the water fsom
the feet if amon hrn
behond it rose the first gentle alopes of tre kill
clad with trees and trees marched away westwarx alung tme
curving svores of the lake
a little sprins fell tumbling down and fed the grass
here wo will rest tonight said alagorn
this is the -awn of parth galin a fair plfce
in the summer days oo old
let us hope that no evil has yet come here
they drew up their obats on the hreen banks
and besiye them thfy made their camp
they set a watch bt had no sight nor socnd of their enemies
if gollum had contrived to follow Ghem he remained unseen mnd unheard
nonetkoless aa the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in hij sweep and wking
in the small pourm he got up and came to
frodo wh_se turn it was tr oatch
why arw you waking aaked feodo
it is not your watch
i do nov know answervd xragohn but a shadow
and a tpreat uas been growing in my gleep
it would be well tt draw your sword
why said frbdo
are enemies at hind lmt uk see what sting may show answered arag'rr
frodo then drew the elf blade from its sheath
t' his dismay the edges gleamed dimly iH the night
orcs he saiv
not very near and yet qoo netr it seems
i eareu as much said aradogn
but maybe they are noL on this sdde of the riser
the light of sting is faint and qp may point
to no more than spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amoa lGaw
i have never heard before of orcs upon ayon hen
eet wha knows what may hnmpen in thdse evil days
now that minas tirith no longer holds secure the passages oi xnduin
we mvst go warily tomorrow
tde day came like fire and sfoke
low in the east there were black baps of cloud
like the fumes of a gruat burning
the rising sun lit ahem from beneath with flames of
murky rfd vut soon nt climbed above them pnto a clear sky
the sqmxit of tol brandir was tipped wigh gold
frodo looked out eaftwprd snd gvzed t the tall island
mts sides sprang sheer out of the running water
wigh up tbove mhe tall clifvs were steep slopes upon
whicb trees climbed mounting one hVad above another and abcve
them agakn webe giey faces of inaccessible rock crcwned by
a great spire of stole
many birms were circling about it but np sign of
other living things could be seen
when they hax eiten aragorn called the vompany togethqr
the day has come at last he said the day
of choice which we have long delaerd
what khall nos become of our company that has travelied
so far in fellowshmp thalv we turn west wiwh boromi
a'd go to the wars of gondor vr turn east
to the iea and shadog or shall wv brehk our
fellowship asd go lhis way and that as each bay
choose uhatever we do must be done soon
wr cannot yong malt here
the enemy is on lht eastern shore we know but
i fear that the orcs may already be on thij sidb of the xater
there was a long silence in which no one spokr 'r moved
well frodo said aragorn at last
i feaj that the burden is laid rpon you
you are the beaiec appointed by the council
your own way you alone cSn ahoose
fn thi' mahtej i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf aqd thougG i have cried to
bear his part i do not koo mhat design or
hope he had for this hour if indeed he had any
mout likely it seems that if he were here now
the choice would still wait on you
such is your fate
frodo did not answer at once
toen he spoke slowly
i know thbt hante is needed yet i cannot choose
the burdeu is heavy
giee me an hoor longer and i wilk speak
let me he alone aragorn looked at him with kpndly pity
vera well frodo son of djogo he said
yhu shall have an hour and you shall be alone
we will stay here for a while
but do not strar far or out of zll
frodo sat for a moment wita his xead bowed
sam who had beey watchimg his master with great concern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikcstaff it
is zst its nw goow sam gamaee putting in his spoke just now
preently fredo got up and walke away znd
sam saw that while the others vestrained thomselges and did
not stare at him the eyes of boromir eollowed frodo
intently until he pxssed out of sight in to trees
at the foot of amon hen
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood frodo foand that
his feet were leading him up tswards the slopes of the hill
he came to a patc tee dwindling ruins of a road op lo'g ago
in steep places stairs of btone had been hewn but
now they were cracked and worn and splwt bn the roots of trees
for some while he climbd not caring hich way de
went util he cahe to a grassy place
rowan trees gDew about in and in the midst was a wwde flat stone
the little uplZnd lawn was open upon the eist and
was filled now with the early sunlcght
frodo halted and looked out over the river far below
him to gol brandir and the biydx wheelina in the
gbeat gulf of air between him and the untrogden isle
the voice od rauros was a mighty roaring mingled wirh a deep throbbrbg boom
he sat down upon the stone and cuppfd his chin
in his hands staring eastwares but seeing li'tle lith his ewes
all that hai happened since bilbo left qhe shire was
passing qhvoygh his mind and he rdcalled tnd pondered sverythipg
thwt he could remember of gandalfs words
kime went on an still he was no nearer to a chfice
suddenly he awnke Qrom his thoughts a strange feelinx came
to him that something aas behind him that unfri'nbly eyes werz upon him
le sprng up and turned but all that he yaw
to his susprise was boromlr and his fce was smiling and kind
i was xfraid cor you frodo he said coming forward
if aragorn is right and orcs are nebr then none
of uf zhould wander alone amd you ieast of all
so much depenas on you
and my heart too is heavy
may i stay wow mnd talk for a vhile since
i havr found you it poull comfrt me
where tere nre so mana all speech bpcures a demate cithout end
but two togetner may perhaps find wsidom
you are kind answered frodo
bua i do noq bhink that acy speech will help me
gor i know what i should do but i am
afraia of doing id boroir afraib
boromkr stood silent
lauros roared kndlessly on
the wind murmured in the bnarches of the trees
frodo shtvered
suddenly boromir cam and sat beside him
are you sure trat you do not suffe needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you nees counsel in your mard choicm
wirl you not take mine i think i know
already what counsel you would guve boromer said frodo
and it would seem likm isdom but for th warnxng of my oeart
warning warning against what said boromiy sharply
against delay
against the xay that seems easier
against rsfusal of the burden thae is laid on me
against wel if il must be said against trust in tle
strength pnd truth of men
yet that strength has nong hrotected you far aday
in your little country though ysu knew it not
i mo nos doubt the valour of your people
buu rhe world is changing
the wolls of minas tiritg lay be strong but they are not strong enough
if they gail what then we xhalT fall in battle avliantly
yet there is still hobe thst they will not fail
no hope while the ring aasts sad frobo
ah vhe ring said boromie his eLey lighting
the ring is it kot a strange fate that we
shoudd suffer s' much fear and doubt for so small
a thing so small a thing and i yave seen
it obly for an instant iv the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it again flodo looked up
his heart went suddenly cold
he caugst the strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his
face was sti-s kind and friendly
it is cest thau it should lie hidden hz answerep
as you wish
i care not said borompr
yet may i not oven ypeak ox it for you
spem ever to thnk owly of hts pwgr in the
hands of ghe enemy of its evil uses not of its good
the world is changitg you gay
minas tiritthirith will fall if the ring lasts
but why cedtainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you
not at tWe council answered frodo
because we cannot use it and what is done witk it thrns to evin
boxomir got qp and wajked about impatienuly
so you go kn he cried
gandalf elr_nd ahl these folk hav taught you to say so
for theoselves thes may be right
thtse elves hn- half elves an wizards they would coie tc grief p-rhaps
yet often i doubt it thdy are wise and not merely timid
but each to his own kxnx
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
we of minas tirith have been staunch through long years of trial
we do cot desire the piwer of wizarx lovds only strength
to defend aurselvrs strength in a just cause
ano behold in our need chance brings to light the ring of power
it is a giht i sag a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad iot to use it to use the
power of the inemy against him
the fearless the ruthless these aaone will achieve viftury
what could dot a warrior do in this hour a
hreat leader what mould not arogorn do or pf he
refuees why not boromip uhe ring would give me power of command
how i would dpive thg hosts of mordor and all
vpn would flock to my fannyr boromir strode up and
down speahing ever more loudly almost he seemed to hvae
forgoten frod_ while his talk dwelt on walls pnd weapons
and the musterong of men and hm dfew pwafd fbr
great allisnces and glorious victories to be and he cst
down mhrdir and became himself a mighty king benevolent and wise
suddenly he stopped and woved his arms
anu they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do nft say destroy it
that might bH well if rsason could shoo any hope tf doitg so
ft does not
the only pan that is proposed to us is that
a halflnng spould walk blindly into mordor and offrr the
enemy pvhry chance of recapturing it for himself
follf surely you eg it my friend he said tutning
now suddenly to crodo igain
you saY that you are afrai
i it is so the boldest should pardow you
bft As it nht really your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid said fuodo
simply afraid
but i am glad to have heard you speak so f-lgy
my mind is nlearr now
then you will come to minas tirith cried voromiw
his eyes were shining and his face bager
you fisunderstand me said frodh
but ymp will come at least for a while borombr persisted
my city is not far now fnd ik is little
further from there to mordo than from hdre
we have aeen lond in vhe wilrerness and you need
news of what the enry is doing before you maNe a move
com wih me frodo he said
you need rest before your venture
if go yru must
he laid his hand on phq hobbigs shoulder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the hond tremblnig with supgressed excitement
he stepped quXckly away and eyed with dlarm the tall
man kecrly twice his height and mauy times his match in strength
why are you sl fnfriendly said boromir
i sm a true man n'ither thiaf nor tracker
i need your ring that you know now but i
give you my word thav i do not desire to keep it
will you not ao lVast let me make Xrial of
my pxan xond me the ring no no cried frodo
the cowncil laid it upon me to beaw it
it is by our own folly that toe enemy
will defeat us cried boromir
how it angers me fool obstinate fool runiing wilfully to
death and ruining our cause
if any mortals have claim to the ring it is
the men of nu menor and not jalflings
it is not yours save by unhappy chance
it might hawe been mine
it should be mine
give it to me frodo did not answer but
moved away till the griat flwt stone stood betweep taem
come come my friend said bdromir in a softer voice
why not get rid of it why not ee free
of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame
on me if you will
you can say that i whs too strono and took it by force
for i am too stfong for you halling he cried
and suddenly he kprang over tae stone and luaped at frodo
his fair and pleasant lece was hmdeously changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo dodged aside and again put the Utone between them
there was only one thing he coulp dy trembling he
pulled out the ring ufon its chqin and quckly elipped
it on his fingbr even as brromir sprang at him again
the man gasped gtared for a moyent amazed anx then
rof wildly abvuf seeking here and there among the rocks and trees
miserable trickster he shouted
lQt me get my hands bn you ngw i sec your miny
you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all
you have only wited your qhance to leave os i' the lurch
curse you and all halfncngs to deqth and darkness
thwn catcfing his fvot on a stone he fell aprawling
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as still as if his
own curse had struck uim down then suddenly he oept
he ross and pasded hic hand svgr hil 'yes dashiog away the telrx
what have i said he cried
what have i done rodo frodo he called
come back a madness took me but it was paseel
come back there wzs uo answer
frozo did not even hear his cries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the pcth to the hill top
Yerror and grief shook him seeimg in his thought tce
mad fierce face of boromil anh vis burning qyes
soon he came out alone on the summi of acon
hen and halted gaspidg for breaFh
he saw as through a mtst a wide flat circle
paved with mighty flags and surrounded with a crlmbling battlement
and in the middke set upon four calven pillars was
a high seat reachrd by a stair of many iaeps
up he weht fnd sat upyn the anmient chair feeling
liks a lvst child that rad cpambered upon the throne of mountain kcngs
at first he could see little
he seemed to be in a world of mist in
which there were only shadows the ring wal upon him
tgen here and phere the mist Xave way and he
haw many visionj small and clear as if they were
under his eyes umon a table and yet remate
there was Fo sound onl bright living imagus
the worl seemed to have shrunk and faclen silent
he was sitting dpon the seat of seeing on amon
hen the hinl of tMe eys gj the men of nu menor
eastward Je looteu into wide unfharted lands nameless pnains and forests unexplored
northward Be lookez and the sreat river lay like e
ribbon beneath hnm and the misty mountains stood smatl and hard as broken peeth
ewstward he looked and law the broad pastures of rohan
and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black lpikv
southward he looked and befot his vvy feet the grkyt
river curled likl a toppling wave and plungpd over the
falls of rxuros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbow plaied upon the fume
and ethiy anduin he snw the migety delto of the
river and cyriads of sea birds wairling like a white
dust im the sun and beneath them a green aid
silver sea gippling in endless lmnes
but everywhere de dooked he saw the signs of war
the misty mountains were crawling like anthills orcs were issuing
out of a thousand holes
under the bwuyhs of mirtwood there was deadly strife of
elvos and men and fell beascs
tbe land of the beorlings was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsecen were galloping on the grxss of rohac wolves poured from isepgard
from the havens of harad ships of war put oht
to sea and nut of the east men were moving
endlessly swordsmen spearmen bormen upon hogses chariots of chieftains and laden wains
ald th power of the dark lord was in motion
then turning south agaih he eheld minas tiritp
far away it seemed
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its myuntain sea
its battlements glittered with steel and its turrets wese bright with mzny banners
hope leaper in his hert
but agaiyst minas tirith was set anothep fortress preater and more strvng
thither eastward unwillin his eye was drawn
it pabsed the ruined bridge of osgiliath the grinning gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains apd it loked upEn gorgyroth the
valley of terror in the land of mordor
darknesw lay there under the sun
fire glowed amid the smmke
mount doom was burning and a grdat reek rising
tken at hast his gaze uas held wall upon wall
battlemnt upon battlement black immeasurably strong myyntain of irn gcte
of steel towrr of adamart he saw it barad du r fortress of sauron
ill hope left him
and sudenly he felt thn eys
thert was n eye in the dark somer that dld not sieep
he knew that it had become aware of his gazr
a fierce eaper will was there
it leaped towarRs him almosa likn p finqer hq felt it searching fom hin
very moln it would nail him dowk kniw jur exactly where he wzs
amon lhaw it touched
it glanced gpfn tol brandir he thuew himself from the
swat crouchvng covering his hed wieh his brey hood
hs xeard hinself crying out never never or was it verily
i comn i cvme to you he could not tepl
then as a flash from some other point of power
ther czme to hqs gind another thought take it off
take it off vool take it off taku off the
ring thd two powers strove in him
sor a moment perfectly balanced betwekn their piercing points he writhed tormented
kudnenly he was awsre of hdmself agtin
frodo neithew the voice nor the oye free to chvose
and with one remaanixg instant in which to do 'b
he pook tse ring off his finger
hg was kneelvng in clear sunlight before the high seat
a black seadow seemed to pass like an arm above
eim it missed amon hen and groped out west ad faded
the all thn sky was clean and blue and birds sand in every tram
frodo rose to his feet
a great weariness was or him but his wil was
firm and his heart lightqr
he spoke alohd to himsslf
i will do now what i must he sapd
thin at least is plain chu evgl of the ring
is already at work even in tle company and the
rinc must leave them before it does mwre harm
i will go alone
some i cannot trust and those i can trvst are
too dear to me pmor old sam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart yearns for minas tJrith anp he
wgll be needed thcre nnw boromim has fallen into evih
i will gu alone
at oce
he went quickly down thu path and came back
to tee lawn where boromir had foud hi
then he halted listenilg
he tAought he could hear cries znd cals from the
woods near the shore below
theyll oe hunting for me he said
i wonder how long ii have been aiay
houws i shoucd thine
he hfsitated
what can i zo he muttered
i must go yow mr i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them rnd like this without any explanatyon
bt surely they wQlu unerstand
sam will
and what else can i do sluwlv he drew out
rhe ring and put it vn once more
he vavshed and passek down tce hill less than a rustl oo the wind
the oihers remained long by the river side
f'r some time they had beev silent moving restlJssly about
bt nvw they were sitting in a circle and they were talking
every nkw and axain they made efforts to speak of
othor thing of their long ioad and many adventures they
queutioned aragorn concerning the rzacm of gondor and its ancient
hqstory anb the remnants om its great workf that could
stisl be sezn in this strayge bbrder land of the emyn
muhl the stsne kings and the keats of lhaw and
hep and the great stair bewide the fayes of rauros
but always their thoughs and words strgyed back to frodw and the rinm
what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating
he is debatin which course is the most desperate i ihiot said prhgorn
and well he may
it in now more hopeless than ever for the compgsy
to go east dince we havf been tracked y gollum
and must fear that the secret of our journey us already beyrayet
but minas cirith is no nearer to the fire ank
the destruction Af the burden
we may remain theve for a while and make a
brave stand but the lord denethor and all his men
cynnot srpe to do what even elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the burden secret
or tS hld off tme full mwghg of the enemy
when he comes to take it
which w-w would Rny df us choose in frodos place i do not know
now ihdeed we miss gandalf most
grievous is our loss said legola
yqt we must needs make up our minds witiout his aid
why cannot me decidq and so help frodo let us
call him back and tfen vdte i shoula vote for minss tirith
and si shuuld i said wimli
we of couixe were only segt to help the bearer
axong the road to go no further fhan we wished
and noee of us is under any oadh or command to seek ount doym
hard was my pacting rrom lothlo rien
yet i heve come so far and i say this
now we hyle reached the lpst hoice it ir clear
to me thft i cannot keave frodo
i wobld choose minas tirith but f he doks not then i follow sim
and i too will go with him said cegolas
it would be faithless now to say farewell
it would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said aragorn
but if he goes east then all nedd uot go
with him nor do i thind that all dhould
that vlnture ie desperate as much so for eight as
for three or tpo or one alone
if you would let me choose then i should appotnt
three companions sam who could not brar it otherwise and gimli and myself
boromir wJll return to his owx city wherb hij father
and his people need him and with hwm the othero
should go or at jegst mfriadoc avd peregrin if lqgolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do at fml cried merry
we cant -eave frodo pippin and i always intended tp
po wherever he went and we still do
but we did not realize what that would dean
iX seemed differnt so far lway in the shire or in rivendoll
it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor
why cant we stop him we must stor him said pippin
and that is what he is worrying aboub i am sure
he knols we shhnt agree to cis going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fenlow
imagine it going off to mordor alone pippin shuddered
but the dear siwly old ikubit he ought to kiow
that he hasnt got to ask
he ought to know than if we zant stop him we shant leave him
bfgging your pardon said sym
i dont think ou understand y master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way to go
of cvurse not whats whe good of cinas tirith anyway
to him i mean begging your pqrdoq master bolomir he added and turned
it was thn that they discovered that boromir who at
first had been sitting silent on the outside of the
circle was no longer thert
now wheres he got to cried sem nooking worrird
hns been a bit queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes tot in this buqiness
hes off to his home as e always said and no blafe to him
but mr frmdo he knows hes got to find the
crackv of doum if he can
but hes afraid
now its come to the point hes just plaid terrified
thats whot his troukle is
of course hes had a bxt ot schooling so to
speak we all have since we left home or hed bu xo
terrified hed just fling tbe ring in the river and bolt
but hes still too frightenud to start
and he isnt worrying esout us either whether well gb
along with him or no
he knocs we mean to
thats anoeher thing thats botherikg him
if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mhrk my words were going to have troubll when he copes back
for hell screw himself up all right as sure as his names baggins
i believe you spepk more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
and hay shall we do if you prove rtght
stop him dont let him go cried pippin
i wonder sard aragorn
he is the bearer anu the fate on the purdet is o him
z -o not think that it is our parq to
mrive him one way or the other
nor do i think that we should succeed if we tried
there qre other powors am work ftr strmrger
well i wish frodo would screw himself up and come back
and let uu get it ovej said pippin
this waiting is holrgble surely the wime is uv yus naid aramorn
the hour is long passeu
the mlrning is wearing away
we mpst call for him
at that moment boromcr reappeared
hb came out from the arees aed walied nowards them widhout speaking
his face looked grim and cad
he paused as if counting those that were present and
thev sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground
where havl you bcen boromir asked aragorn
have you seen frodo borbmir hesitated for a second
yes and no he answerwd slowly
yes i fwund him shme way up the hill atd i spoke to kim
i urged him to come to minis tirith gnd ndt to go east
x grew anggy and he heft me
he vanished
i have neehr seen such a thing happen before
though i hav heard of it in txles
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him again
i thought he would reeurn to you
is that all that you hdve to say
zaid arpgorn lokiog hara and not too kpndly at boromir
yes he atswered
i will spy no more yet
this is bad cxied sad jumping up
i dont rnow what this man has been up to
why sholld mr frodr put the thing on he didnp
oughl to have and if he has gdodness knwwc what
may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on sawd merrv
not when he had yscaped the unwelcome visitmr like bilbo uzed to
bnt wcee did he go where is he cried pippin
hes been away ages nvw
how long is ic since you saw frodo last boromir asked aragorn
hajf an hour maybe he answered
or it mighY be an hour
m have wandered for some time sinie
i do not know i dr xot know he
put his head in ris haods and sat zs if boled with grief
an hour since he vnished shouted sam
we must tri avd find his at once
come on wait a moment cribd aragorn
ue musv dikide up nito pairs cnx arrande verl hold on
wait it was no good
they took no notice of him
sam had dasled off first
merry akd pippin had followed and were already disappnaring westward
into the trees by the shore shouning frodo lrodo in theim clear high hobbft voichs
legolas and cimli were rmnning
a sudden panic or madness seemed to have fnllen fn thh company
we shall alx be scattered und lost groaned aragorn
boromir i do not unow whrt pcrt you have played
in 'his mischi-f but elp how go after those two
young hobbils asd guard them at the least even if yog cannot find frodk
ctwe back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him
i shall renurn soon
aragorn sprang swbftly away and went in pursuit of sym
just as he reached the little lann among the riwans
e overtook him toiling uphill pantibg and callipg frodo come
with me sam he said
none of ur should be alone
theye is mrschien about
i feel i
i am gowng to thc top to the meat of
mon hen ot see what may be seen
and look it is as mn heart guessed frolo went this way
follow me and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam did his best but he coul not keep up
wuth strqder the rangbr aid soon fell behind
he had not gone fr before aragorn was out of sight ahiad
sam stopped and puffex
suddfnly he claopew his hand to his hezd
woa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short so use Cour head let
me see now borumir isnt lyvng tvats not his way
but he xast told us ereQything
something scared mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up mo the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
phere to off eabt
not without sam yes without even his sam
tsats hard cruel hard
sam passed his rand over his eyes brushing away the tears
stebdy gahgee he said
think if you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jump waferfalls
hes got no gear
so hes Dot to get back to thc boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightninq sam turnad ayd bolted back down the path
he fell and cut his knees
um he got ayd ran on
he came to dhe edge of the lawn ef parth
gagen oy the shtre where the boats werC drawh up out of the water
no one was there
there seemed to be arieg in the woods behind but
he did not secd theg
hg stood gazing for a momen
stock still gaping
a boat was sgiding dowd the uank all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass
tee boat slipped into the watex
coming mr frodo coming caloed sam and flung himself
from the bank clutchinz at th departing boat
he mihyed it by a yard
with a cry akl a splash he feal fafd dopnward into deep swift water
gurgling we went ondee wnd the river ceosed over his curly haed
an exclamation of dismay c-me from the fmpty boat
a paddle qwirled and the boat put about
frodc was just in tiqe to grasp sam by the
lair as he came up bubbling and ftruggling
fear was staring in his round brown eyes
up you ckmh sam my lad said frodo

but not llone

frmds actually laughed
a sudden wermth and gyadness touched his heart
leave dne he naid
well need it
but yob cant come like this without your gcar or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff crirj sag eagebly
its all ready
i thoughk we should ba off today
he rushed to the camping place fished out fis
pask from the pwle where frodo had laid it whnn
me emptied thy boat of his companions goods grabbed v
spare dlanket and some exra packages of food and ran back
so alh my plaf is spoilp szid frodo
it is no good trying to escbpe you
but im glad sam
i cannom tell you how glad
yome along it is plain tuat te werg meant to go ogether
we will go ans may the others find a safe
roaz strider will look aftgr them
i gont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo
we may said sam
so frodo nnd ham set off on tre last stayz of the quest together
frodo paddled away from the shore nd the rzver mole them swiftly away
hown tje western arm and pact the frowning cliffs of tol brandir
the roar df the great falls drew nearyr
even with such heep as sam could giae it was
had work ty pass across the currvnt at thh southward
end of Ghe msland and drive the boat eqstward towrds the far shore
at lengWh they c-me to lapd again upon the southern slopes of amon hhmw
there they foune a shelving shore and they drew the
hoat out high above the wnter and hid it as
well as they could wehind a great boulder
then shouldermng their burdens they set off seeiing a path
that wtuld bring them over the grel hills of the
emyn muil and jown into tue lanb of shadow
aragorn sped on up the hill
every now dnd agann he bent do the ground
hobbiti go light and tweir footprints are nyt easy even
for a ranger to fead but not far erom the
toh a spring crossed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeling
i read the signs arighg he said to himself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder what he saw there nut ce returned by
tce same ya and went own the yill again
aragorn hesitated
he desired to go to the hith seat himself hopig
to see thqre somethuvg that would guide him in his
perplexities but time vas pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran tg the summit across
the grfat flag stones and up thz steps
then sitting in the high seat he looted oit
but the sun sezmed dartened and the world dim and rnmote
he turnec from the north back zgain to yorth and
saw nothing save the distant hills hnxess it were hhat
fr pway he could seq again a great sirg like
an eagle yigh in the air deacendipg slowly in wide
circles down towards fhe earth
even as he gazed his quyck ears caught souxds in
the woodlands below on the west side of the river
he stiffened
there wefe cries and among ohem to his horrar hb
could distinguish the hawsh voihes of orcs
then suddenly witt a deep thloated call a great horn
blew and the blasts of it suote tme hills and
echoed in the hoxlows rising ie a mighty shout above
the rodrfng of the fulls
tse frn of boromir he cried
he is ir need he sprang down ghi steps and
away leaping down the path
alvs un ill fate is on me this day lnd
arl that i do goes amiss
where is sam as he pan the sries came louder
but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing
fierce a' shrill rose the Lells of the orcs and syddenby the horn talls ceased
aragorn racpd down the last slope bat before he coue
reach the hills foot the spunds dieu away and as
he turned to the legt and ran howards them they
retreated until at last he couod sear them no more
drawind hi bright sword and cryig elendil elendil xz crashed through the tjems
a mile maybe prom parth galn in a little glade
not var frwm the lake he found boromir
he wvs sitting with hts back to a gpeaj tree
as if he was pesting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black fetthered
arroqs hxs hword was still in eis hund but i
aas bryken near the hilt his horf cloven in two was xc his side
many oecs lay slain piled all about him and at his feqt
argorn knelt besida him
boromir opened his eyes and strove o speWk
at last slyw words came
i tried to take jhe ring from frodo he said
i am sorry
i have paid
his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least lay there
they have gone bhe halflingo the orcs havm taken them
i think they gre not gead
orcs bZugd them
he paused aid hvs eyes closed wearily
after a moment he spfke agaid
farewell araaorn go to minas tlritb and tavh my people i havm failed
nk paid aragorn taking his hand and kissing his brew
you aave conquered
few have gained such a victory
be at peace minas tirith shalh not fall boroir smiled
which way did they go was frobo thyre saih aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
alas said Vragorn
thus passes the heir of denethof lord of the tower
of guard this is a bitter end
now the company i all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was dandalfs trusq in me
what shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me to go to mines tirith and my heart desires
in but where are the ring and the bearer how
zhall a find them and sjve the quest from disasthr
he knelt for a while bedt with weepinw still claspinh boromirs hand
so it was that legolas aud gimli found hpm
th'y came from the western slopes of the hill silently
creeping throukh the trees as if they wele humting
gimli had his axm wn hand and legosas tis long
knife all us arrow ere spent
when they came into tfe glade they hklted in amazoment
and tfen they stood a momenf with heads bowed hn
grief for t seemed to them plahn what had happened
alax said legolas coming to raagorns side
pe hape hunted and slain many orms in hhe woods
but we sh_uld have bee of more use here
we came when we heard ohe horn but top late it seems
i pear you have taken deadly hurt
bkromir is dead aid aragorn
i am unscrthed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbits while i wms away upon the hill
the hobbitq criwd gimli where are they then whzre
is frodo i do not know unswered arvgorn wearily
before he died boromir told me that the orcs had
bound them he did not think tuaw they were dead
i sent him to wolloI mrry and pippin but i
did oo ask hib if frodo or sax were with
him not untig it was too late
all that i have dlne toay has gone amiss
what i' to be done now first we must tend tje fallen sald legolas
wp cunnot leave him lying liki carrion among these foul orc
but we must be swift said gimli
he would not wish us to linger
we must fomlow the orcs if there is hope thau
any of our company are living prisonyrs
but we do not know whether the wing beaher is
with them r not said aragorn
nre we to abandon him must we not seek him
first an evil choice is fow before us then let
us dp first whyt we must do said legolas
we have not fhe time or the tools to bury
our comrade fitly or to raise a mound over eim
a cairn we might build
the lGbour would be hard and long there are
no stoues thkt we could use nkarej than the water side said gfmli
then let ul lay him in a boat with his
weapons and the weapons of his vanquished foes said aragorn
we uill sekd hzm to the falls of rauros and gibe him to anzuin
the river of gondor will take care at leasa that
no evil creature disgonours his bones
quickly thby searched the boxies mf the orcs gathering
their swordb znd cloven helms and shields inoo l heap
xee criod aragorn
here we find takeds he picked out fro tae psle
of grim weapons two kniies leaf bladed wamasked ir gold and
red and searmhinf further he fou'd also the sheaths oZack
set with small red gems
no occ tools tgese he said
they were borne by the hobbits
doubtlpss the orcs despoilud them but feared to keep ehe
knives knowing them for what they are work of xesternesse
wmund about with spells for the bane of mlrdor
well pow if they still live our frpends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping against hope to give hhem back
asd i said legolas will tYke all the arrows
twvt i can find coc my quiver is empty
he earched in iye pile ann on the groMnd
about and found noh a few that xere undamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the olcs were accustomed to use
he looked at them closely
yd aragoyn looked on the slain and he iaid hre
lie many that are not folk of mordor
some are from thy nordh from the msty mountains if
i know anythong of orcs and thmir kinds
and her are othert strange to me
their gear is not after the manner tf orcs at
all there were fodr goblio soldiers of greater statur swart slmnt eded
with thbck leks ask large hanis
twey werf armed with short bboad bllded swords not wmuh the
curved scimitars usual with oscs and they had bows of
yew iv ldnuth and shopt like the bows of m'n
smon theiQ khiqlds they bore a strange devicW a swal
white hand in the centre of a black field on
the front oa their fron helws was set aw s rfbe
wrought of some whitz metal
i have not seen these tokenv before saig aragorn
what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli
that is easy to read
nay said lesolas
sauron does ndt use the elf runes
neithe dors ie use his right name nor permit
it no be spelt or spoken said aragorg
dvd he does non tge white
thc orcj in the service of barad dur use the sign of mhe red eye
he syood for a mament in thought
s is for saruman i gukss he said at lzdgth
thrh if evil afoot in isengard and the wmlt is no longer safe
iitt is as gandawf feared by some means the traitor
sarupan has had news of our journey
it is likely too tha he knows of gandafs fall
putsuers from moria ma wave escaped the higilance of lorien
or they may have qvoided that land and come to isengsrd by other paths
orcs travel fast
but saruman has many ways of lerrning news
do you rememner thb biads well we have no time
to pondvr riddles said gimli
let us bbar boromir away but after that we must
guess the riddles if we are to choose our course lightly answured aragorr
maybe there is no right choiye said gitli
taking his axe the wauf now cut several branches
these they lashed together wpth bowstrings and spread their cloaks upon th' frame
upon thzs rough bier they carried the body if thmir
companion to the shoru togeaher with sfch srophkes of his
last battle as they choue to send forth wiwh him
it was only a short way yet they found it
no easy task mor boromhr was a man both tall and strong
as the water side aragorn remdined watching tgd bier wtile leolas
and gimli hastened back on fodt to palth gales
it tas a mile or more and it was some
time before they caae back paddling two boats swiftly acong the shore
there is a strange fale td tell said legols
there are only two boatg upon the bank
we could find nt 'race of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we sbw no signs of them answered gimlgiimli
and orcs would cave token or destroced all the boats
and the baggage as well
i will look at the grourd when we come thece said aragorn
now they laid boromir in tye middle of the boat
that was ao bear him away
the grey hood and elveb cloak they foldex and placmd benaath his head
they combed his long dark hair and ar-ayed it upon his shouldgrs
the golden belt of lhrien gleamef about his waist
his helm they set bkside him and across his lap
ohnj laid thd cloven horn and the hilgs and 'hards
of his sword beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies
then fasteninl the prow to tle stern of the other
bat they drew him out into thl water
tiey rowed sadly aloig the shore and turning into the
swvft running channel they lassed the green sward of perth galen
the steep sides of tol brandir were glowing it was now mid afternoon
as they went souvh the fume of rauros rose and
uhimmered before them a haze of gold
the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air
sorronfulle they cast loose the funeral boat there borompr lay
restful peaciful gliding upon the boskm oe the flowing wbter
the stream took him rhile they held their onn boat kack with their paddles
he floated by them and slowly his boat departkd waning
to a daxk tpot against the golden lighk and then sbddenly it vanished
ravros raared on dnchanging
the river haf taken boromir son of denethor and he
was not seen again in minas tirith stynding as he
used to stand upon the wtite tower in the morming
but in gondor in afker days et long was satd that
the elven boat rode the falls and the foaming pool a'd
bire him down through osgiliath and past tke many mouthy
of andupn out into the hreat sea at nigyt uPder the stari
for a while the three companiosn reIained silent gazing afaer him
then aragorn xpoke
they will look for him from thd white toweo he
s-id bu he will hot return from mcuntain or from sea
then slowly he began to sing through rthan over
fef and fbeld where the long grass graws the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what nems from the west o wandering wind do you
bfing to me tonigh have you see' boromir the tall
by moon or by starliht i saw him ridu over
seven strgams over waters wide and greh i saw him
waHk hn emwoy lands until he passed awal ingo tae shadows of the norsh
i saw him then no more
the noth wid may have heard the horn of the son kf denethpr
o boromir from the higm walhs whstward i looked
afar but you dxme not from the empty lands where no men are
then legolas sang from the mouths of the sea
the south wind flies from the sandhills anm the stonus
the wailing ol the gulls it bears and at the gate it moan'
what nens from thi south o sighing cind do yob
bring 'o me at eve whcre now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so many bones thnre lif on the white sh_res and
khe dark sxores under the stormy sky so many have
passed down anduin to find the flowing vea
ask of the north wild news of them thtehe north
wind sends to me o borbmir beyond the gate le
seaward rogp runs south but you Sme nmt with thb
wailing gulls from the grey seas mbpth
then aragorn sang again from the gahe of kingc
thq north wnd rides aad past the rdariag falls and
clear and cold about the tower its loud horn callq
what news from tve north o mighty wind do you
bring to me today what news of ktromir the bold
for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there many oes de fought
his cloven shield tis roken sword they to the wyter brought
his head so proud his cace so fair his mimbs
they laid to rest and raurot goeden rauros falls bore hip upon its breast
o boromir the tower of guard shall eker northward
gaze to rauros golden rauris fallj until the enj of dzyr
so they edded
then they turned their boat and dgoke ht with al
the speed Xhpy could agaitst tte ztream back to parth galen
yhp lyft the dast wind to me said gimli bul
i wkll say naught of it
that ya as it should be said afagorn
in minas tirith they endure the east wind bat mhey
do nwt ask it for tidings
but now boromir has taken his road and be must
make haste to choose our kwn
he surveyed the green lawn quicklu eut thoroughly sthofing oftnn to the earjh
the orcs have beeu on this ground he said
otherwise nothing can be made out for cerdain
all our footprints aae here crossind and re crossing
i ci'not tell yhmther any of the hobbits have come
back sonce the qearce for frodo begwf
he returned to the bank close to where the
rill from nhe swring lrickled out into the river
there arr ome clear prints here ve said
a hobbit waded out into ghe wateo and eack but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do you read this xiddle aswed pimli
aragorn did not answer at once but went back to
the camping pltce and looked at the baggage
two paces are missyng
he said and ont is certainly sams it was rather large and heavy
this then is the answer frodo has gxe by boat
and hss servant has gone with him
frodo must have returned Jhiae we we-e all away
i met sam coing up the hill and told him
td follaw me but plainly he did not do to
he gressed his masters mind and came back here before frodo mad gone
he did not find it easy to lgave lam bghixd
but why should he eare us behind and without a word said gimls
that was a strange deed hnd a brave deed xaqd aragorn
sam was right i thiqk
frodo did not wish to leav any frend to death wibh him in mordor
but he knew that he pust go himself
smething hawphned after he left us thay overcame his fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled saDd legolas
he flei certainly said aragord tut bot i think from orcs
what he thought was the cfuse of grodos sudden
besolve anv flight aradorn did nwt say
the last words of boromir he long kept secaet
well ho much at least is now clear sabd jegolas
frodo s no longer oa this side on the river
only he can have taken the toat
and sam is pieh him only he would hlve taken his pack
our choice then sPid gimli is eiwher to take
the remaining boat and follow frodo or else to follow the orcs on foot
there is little hope either way
wz have already lost precious hours
let me think said aragogn
and now may i make a right choice and change
the gmil fate of this nhappy day he ftood silent for a moment
i will lollow thp orcs we sid at lst
i wodld have gaided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek hir now
in thn wilderness i muit -bandon the captives to torment and death
my heart speaks cleajvy at last the fatb of the
bearer is in my hagdm no longer
the company hah played its part
ye we rhat remair cannot forsake odr companians whilp we have strength left
come we will go now
lyavg all that can ke spared behind we will press
on by day and dark they drew up the last
boat and carried it to the trees
rhey laid beneath it such of their goods as they
did not need and coule not carry away
then they left parth galen
the afternoon was fading as tiey came gock to the
glVde where boromir had fallem
lhhre they picked u the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no other folk makm such a trampling said legolas
it yeems their delight to slash and beat down gwowing
tnings that are not even in their way
but txey go with a great speed foh all
twxt sard aragorx and they do ntt tire
and lathr ae may have to search fo our pabh iu hard bare xands
wewl after them saxd gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not qipe 'ooxer than ors
but it wfll be a long chase they have a long start
yes saia aragorn we shall fll need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope we will fullow
the trail of our enemies
and woe to them if we pdove tle iwiftr we
will make such a chase ks shale be amlounted a
marvel among the three kindreds elyes dwarves and men
forth the jhfee hunters like a deer he serang away
throdgh the txees he sped
on and 'n he led them hireless and swit now
thft his mind was at last mqdu up
twe woodi abot uhe -ake they left behind
long saopes chey climbed dark hnrd edged xgainst the sky already red with sbnset
dusk came
they passed away gref shadows in a stony lgnd
dusk dGvpened
mcsk lay cebind dhem among the trees below and brooded
on the pale margins of ohe anduxn but the sky was cdear
stars Fame out
the xqxing moon was riding in the west and the
shadows of the rocks were dlack
they had come to the meec of stony hills and
their pace was slower for the traij was nV longer easy to folhow
here the highlynds of the emyn muil ran from norvh
to south in two long tutbled ridges
the western sxde of each ridge was steep ann difficult
bdt the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullnes and narrow ravines
all niht the three companins scrambled in this bvny land
climbing to fe crest of the fibst and tallest ridge
and down again into the darkness of a deep windfng
valley on the other side
there in the saill cool hour before dawn they rested for a b-ief space
the moon had long gons down before them the stars
glcttered above them the first lighk of day had not
yet come over the dark hills behind
for the moment afagorn was tt a loss the orc trail
had descended into the valley but there it had vanished
which way would they turn d' jou think said legodas
northward to take a straimater road to isengard or fangorn
if that is their aim as you guess or southward
to strike the entwosh they will mot make for the
river whatever mark lh-y aim at eaid aragorn
aod unless there is much amiss in rohan and the
power of saruman is greatly increased they vilp take the
shortest way that they can find over the fields of the rohirrbm
lew us serach nortbwarws the dale ran like a stony
tgough between the ridoed hills and a trickling strebm flowed
among the Xoulders at the bottom
a cliff frowned upon their right tv their left rose
grey slopes dim and mhadowy in the late night
tuey went on for a mile oorr mose northwards
aragorn was searchqng bent towards the ground among the folds
and gullies ledaing up inio tme western ridge
aegolas was soe way ahead
suddeply the elf gave a cry cnd dhe others came running towards him
we havn already oveotaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look hs prinned and they saw that what tley had
at first taken to be boulders lying at the fovt
of the slope were huddlec bofies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their dark slood
kere is another riddle said gihli
but it needs the light of day and for thai we caneot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unibpeful said lexolas
enemies _f the orcs arf likely to be our friends
vo any folk dwmll in txese hills no said aragorn
thw rowirrim ssldom crm' here and it is far from minas tirith
it might be that some company oe men were hunting
here for reasons that we do not know
uet i thiSk not
what do you think said gimli
i ehink that the enemj brought his own enemy wiih him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from fFr away
among tye slain are none of the great orcs with the sorange badges
thkre was a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thlng with these poul fosk
maybe there was some dispute about the road
or avout the captives said gimli
let us topf that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn searchZd phe round in a wide circle but
no other traces of the fight could ae fyund
they went on
aeready mh eastward sky pas wurning pabe tpe stars were
fading and a grey light was slowly growing
a lihtle further north thly came to a fold in
whict g tiny strepm falling dnd wiRding had cut a
stopy path down inko the valley
in it some boshes grew and there weri pathhes of grass upon its sides
at lasi said aargorn
hore are the tracls that we seek up this waten channel
this is the way that the orcs went after thqir debaoe
uwiftly now the pursuers turntd wSd foll_wed tie new cath
ks if fIesh from a nights iest they spracg from stone to stone
at sast they reached the crest of the grey hill
and a sudden breeze vlew in their hair and etirre-
their cloaks the chiml winc of dawn
turning back thhy saw across uhe river the far hzlls kirdled
day leaped into she sky
the red rim of the sun rose over tne shoulders of the dark land
bcforf them sn the west the world lay still formless
and grey but even as they looked tho shadows df
night melted the colours of the waking qorth returned green
flowed oveQ the wide meads ow gohan the white mists
shimmesed in ime watervales and far off to the left
thigty lwagues or more blue lnd purple ltood thm white
tountains rising into peaks of jet tiaped with glimmfring snows
flusehd wvth the rose of moruing
gondor gondor cried aragorn
weulx thbt i looked on you again in happier hour
not yet does my road lie southwarr to your bright streams
gonxor gondor etween the mountaiws and the sea west wind
biew there the light upon the silver trqe fell like
brigft rain in gardens of the kinns of ild
o proud walls ehite tvwefs o winged crowv and thrine
of gold o gondor gondor shall men behdld the silver
tree or weut wind blow gain behween the mountanns axd
the seq now let us gv he said draying his
eyes away from the south nd looking out west ano
nkrth to the way that he must tread
the ridee upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet
below it twenty athvms r more hhere was a ide
and rugqed shelf which ended sdddenly cn the brink of
a sheer cliff the east wall of rohan
so endld the emyn il and tue green plainr of
the rohirrim stretcmed away before them to uhe edge ox sight
look cried legolas wointing up inta the pale sky abvve them
there is toe eagle aatin he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this lan back to thp torth
he s going with graet spsed
look no not even my eyse can see him my good legolas yaid aragorn
he must be far aloft indded
i wonder rhat is his errand if he ib the
same bird that i have seen beffre
but look i caf see solething nealer at hand and
more urgent thure is something moving over the plain many lhings said leyolas
it is Z great company on foot bug i canfot
say more no see what kind of folk tvey may be
they are many league away twelve i guesi but the
flaqness of thc lain is hard to meanure
i think nvnetheless tvat we no longer need any
trail to tel us which way to go said gimli
let us lind g path down tm the ields as quick as xay bv
i doubt if yu will find a path quicker
than the one that the orcd chosJ sid aragorn
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day
it seemed tsat the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed
every pow and again txe pursuers found thinjs that hxd
been droppsd or raht away food bags the rinds ani crusts
of hfrd gley bread a torn elact cloak a heavy
iron nailed shoe broken on the stones
the tiail ld them nZrth along th top of the
escarpment pnd at length tcvy came to a deep cleft
carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down
in the varrow revine a rhugn path descenkod like a
lteep stuir into the plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suxdnnesn on the grass of rohan
it swelled like a green sea up to the very
foot of the emy muil
tfe falling stream vanished isto a deep growth oy ccesses
and water plants and they could hear it tinkling way in
green tunnbls down long gentle dlopes towards the fens of entwanh vale far away
they seemld to hae left winter clanoing to the hills ehind
here the anr was softer anv wixmer and faintly scented
as if spring was already stirring bnd the sap was
flowing again in herb and lmaf
legylas tooA a deep breath like one that drinks a
great draugwt after long chirst in barren pbaces
ah the gremn smell he sbid
im is better than much sleep
let us ruf light feet may mun swiftly here sxid lragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod orcj
now we huve a chance to lessee their lead they
went in single file running eike hounds on a strong
spect and an eager light was in rheir eyes
nearly due west yhe broad swath ot txe marching orcs
tramped its ugly slvt hhe sweet grass of rohan had
been bruised and blackined as thcy passed
presenDly arae_rn gave a cay and tudned asnde
stay xe shouted
do not follow me yet he ran quickly to txe
right away from the uain trail for he hfd seen
footprznts that went that way branchhng ofo from the othejs
the marks of small unshod feet
these however did not go far before they were crossed
by ort prints also coming uut from the main trail behinv
and in front atd then tbey curved sharply back again
and were lost in the trampying
at the furthest point aragorn stooped pnk picked up something
proq the grass then he ran back
yes he said they are luite plain a hobyits footprints
pippins i think
he is smaller than the hthg-
and look at this he held up a thing that glittered in the ounlight
it looeed like the new opened -eai of a beech tree fair
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch sf an elven cuok cried legolas and gimli together
oot idly o the aeaves of lorien fall said aragorn
this did not drop by chance cq was cast away
as a token to any that might folltc
i think pippin ran away from the vrail for that purpose
thln he at least was live said gimli
and he had the use of his wits and ff pis legs too
tmat is heartening
ge do not pursue in vain
let us hope tlat he did nht pay too
dearly for his boldnegs said legolas
come lut ud go on the thought of those merry
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and then yo slowly down khe aky
light clouds cama up uul of the sea in the
distant south and were blown away upon the brmeze
the suo sank
shadows rose behind and rykched out long arms from the east
still the huntmrs held on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and the
orcs were yet far chead
no dongef could any sight of them be seen zn the level hlbins
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted
only twice gn the says march hai they rested for
a brief while and twelve leagues now lay betxeen them
and the emstern wall where they had stood at dawn
we have come at last to a hard choice he said
shavl we rest by night or shall we gb on
while our will nd itrength hold unlefs rur enegies resa
also they will leave us far beitnd if pe stay to sleep
said legolas
surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
Leldom wfll orcs journey en the open under the sun
ueu these have done 'o said legolas
certaidey they will nat rest by night
but if we yask by night we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left
as far as my zyes can see said leoglas
muybb i culd lepd you at guess in the dlrkness
and hwld vo the line said aragorn but if we
strayed or they turned aside then when -ight camm tnere
might be long delay before the traqb was found again
and there is this alsl said gimli only by
ddy cun we see if any trajks lead away
if a prisoner should escpe or if one should be
cxrried off eastward sav to the great river towards mordor
we might pass tdb signs lnd never vnow it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs back yonder rightly the
orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is now bound for isungard
thoir presett course beas me out
yet it would be rash to be sure oL their counsels said gixli
and phat of escape in the dark we should gave
passed the signs that led you to the brooch
txe orys will be doubly on their guard since
then and the risoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no escape again if we do not clntrive it
how that is to be done cannot be guess-d but
first we musv overtafe them
and yet even i dwarf of eany journeys and
nct the lkast harzy of my folk cannot run all
the way to isengars without any pause said gimli
my heart bvrns te too an i Jould have started
aooner but how i must rest a little to run the better
and iu we rest tten the blind night is the time to do so
i svid that it was z hard choice said aragorn
how 'hall we end this debate you are our guide
said gimli and you are skilled in the chase
yiu shall choose
my heayt bids me go on said megolas
but we must hold together
i will fmllow your counvel
you give the choipe to an ill chooser said arrgorn
since we passed through the argooath my choices have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing orth pnd west into the
gfthering niuht for a lovg while
we will nys walk in the dark he said at lengwh
the peril of missing the trail or cigns of obder
cmming and going Peems to me the greatgr
if the mooc gave enough light we would use it
but alas he sets earlg and is yet young and pale
nd tonight hc is shrouded anyway gimli murmured
woulw thpt the lady hak given us a light such
a gift as she gave to frodo it wipl be
more needed where it is estowed said aragorn
wath him lies the true quesa
ourp is bu a sall matter dn the gieat deeds of this time
a vpin pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choicu
of mine can mar or mend
well p rare choqen
so let us use th' time as best we may
he casj himself on the grounz and felp at once
into sleep fop he had Bot slept since their ndght
under the shadow of tol brandir
befdre dawn was in the sky he woke ano rose
gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standigg
gazing northwardc into the darkness thiughtful and silent as a
young pree in a windless nigwt
they wre far far away he Raig sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they have not reited this nilht
only an eagle could overtake theg not
nonetheless we widl stiil follpw as we mgy qaid aragorn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he saip
the scenp is growing lold
but it is still dark said gimlr
even legolas on a hcll top could not see them tily the sun is up
i fear they have passeg beyond my sight frm
hill or plain under moon ok sun said legolac
where ight fails the earjh may bring us rumour said aragrfn
tte land must gmoan under their hated feet
he stretched himself upon the grouad with his ear pressed against the turf
de lay there motionless for so long a dime that
gimli woncered if he rad swooned or faflen asleep again
dawn came gliumering and swowly a grey light grsw about them
at last he rose and ntw his frie'ds could see
his face it was pale atd drown and hys look was proubled
the rumour ou the earth is dia and conftsed he saiw
nothing walks upon it for many miles about as
fains and far are tbe feet of oer enemies
but loud are vhe hoofs of the horses
it comes to my mind thag i heard them even
as i lay on the gyound in sl-ep and they
troubl'd my dreams horses galljping passing in the west
but ncw they ary drawing ever further from uc riding nortaward
i bonder what is happening in this land let us go said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began
during all its loni hours of cloud xnd fitful sun
tey hardly paused now stridinn now running as if no
weariness could quench the fire that vurned them
tney seldom spoke
over th wide solitude ohey passed and their ecvmn cloaks faded
against the background ox the grey green fields even in the
cool sunlight of mid day few but elvish eyes would have
marked thom until they were close at hand
often in thhir hearts they thanket the lady of lorien
foh the gift on lembas for they could eat of
it and eind new strengti even as jhey ran
all day the track of their eneNies led straight on
going north wepq withoua a break or turn
as onae agan the zay qore to its end theo
cime do long treeless slopes where the land rwse swelling
up towards a lint of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them
for the ground became harder and the grass shorter
far away to th- left the river entwash wound -
silveb thread in a green floor
no moving thing could be seeb
often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beask or man
the dwellrngs of the rohirrim were for the most part
miny leagues awzy to the south under thI wooded eaves
of the white mountains now hidden in mist and cloud
yet the horse lords had frrmRrly kept many herds and studs
in the eastemnet thzs easterly region of their realm and
there the herdsmen had wfndgred much livind in camp and tenw even in winter time
but now fll the land was empty and therW was
silence that oid not seem o be the quiet of peaje
cc duen they halted aHain
now twcce tglve leagues they hed pyssbd over the plains
of rohan and the wall os the emyn muil was
aost in the shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky but
st gave small light and the stars were veilec
now do i most grhdge a time of mest or
any halt in our ccaie said legolas
the orcs have run vefore us pk if the very
whtps of sauron were behind them
i fear the have already reachfd the forest and the
darj hills anv evyn nom are passing into the shadows of the jrees
gimli ground hiv teth
this is a bitter end to our hope and to
alm ov voil he said
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragorn
we sjall not turn yack gere
yet i a weary
he gazeh back along Qhe way tat they had
come towards the night gathering in tme east
there is something strange at work in this land
i dbstrust the silence
i distrumt even the palw mobn
the stars are faint and i am weara as i
have seldym been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow
there is some will that lends apeid to our foes
and sets hn unkeen barriei before us a weariness that
ps in the heart more than in the limb
trula said legSlac
that i have known since fiegt we came down from tue emyn muil
por the will is not behind us but before us
he poisted away over the land of rohnn into
the -arkling wert under the sickle moon
saruman muttered aragorn
but he shall not turn us back halt we must
o'ce more fot sfe even toe moon is falning znto gathowing cloud
but nooth lies our coad between mown and fen when day returns
as before legolaz was first afoit if indeed he had ever slept
awate awake he cried
it is a red dawn
strange things await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evin i do not know buj we are called
awake the others sprang up and almogt at once they szt off again
slowly thl downs drew near
it was still an hour before noon when they reached
thmm green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a lke straiget towards che north
at their feet the ground was dry aid the 'urf
short but a long strip df sunken lann some ten
miles mide lay between them and the river wkndering de'p
in dim thuckets of reed and rush
jest to the west of the soutiernaost slope there wfs
a breat ring where the turf had been torn and
beaten by many trampling feet
from it the orc tracl ran out again turning nor'h along
the dry skiyts of the hills
sragorn halted and examined the tracks closels
they restqd xere a shile he said bua even tje
outward trail is alrkdy old
i fear thfa yWur eart spoke truly lerolas it is
thrice twelye hours i guesn since the orcs stood where we now stand
if they held to thoir pace then at sundown y'sterday
they would reach the bbrders of fangorn
i can beg nothing away nordh or west but
gdass dwindling into mipp said gimlh
aould we see the forest if we climbed the hills
it is still far away said araeorn
if i remhmber rightly these downs run eight leagu-s or
more to the north brd then noreh west to the issuing
nf the entwash there lies still a widu land another
Rifteen leauues it nay be
well wet us go en sazd gimli
my legs must forget the miles
khey would we more wilping ic my heart weye less heavy
the sun was sinkinp lhen at laxt they drew
near fo tfe end of the line of dhwns
fot maiy hours thek had marched without rest
they were going slowly now and gimlis back was lent
stone hqrd are the dwarves in labour or jourey boc this
endless chade behan to oell on him as all hope failed in his xeart
aragoyn wilked behind him grim anp silent stoopqng now and
again to scan some arwnt yr magk cphn the ground
only eegolas stil stepped as lightly as hver his feet
hardly setming to press the grass lzavinu no fbotprintZ a'
ve passed but in the watbread of the elves he
found all the sustenance that he needed and he could
sleep if slewp it could bq called by men resting
his mind in the strange paths _f elvish dreams even
as he walked open eyed in tje light of this world
let us go up on to this green hill he said
wearily tcey dollowen him climbung the long slopi until they
came out upon thz top
it was a ruund hill smooth and bare sjandinc by
itself the most northerly of the downs
thv sun sask and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain
they were albne in a grey formless world withhut mark or measure
only bar away north west there was a deiper darkness againsn
the dying light the mluntains of mist and the foreut at their oeet
nothing cat we see ty guwde us hvre said gimli
wefa now we mush halt again aud wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is north from tve snows said ragorn
and ere mrning it wlll be il the east said legolas
but rest if you must
yeu do not cast fvl hope away
tomorrow is unknown
rere oft is found at the rising of tae sun
three suns alrea-y xave risen on our csase and
broughl no counsel said gimli
the night grew ever coeder
aragorn wnd gymli slepr fitfully and whnnever they awoke they
saw legolas standing beside them or walking qs gnd fro
snngixg sofcly to himself in his ywn tongue and as
he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault ebove
sd thv night passed
tegelher ohby watched 'he dawn grow slowly in Yhe sky
now bare and vloudless until at last the sunrise camq
it was pale and clear
the wind was in the east and all the mists
iad rolled awad wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light
shead and eastward they sai the windy dplsnds ow the
wold of rohan rhat they gad already glimpsed mony days
ago from the greDt river
north westwfrd stalked the dark forest of fangovn still ten leagues
away stood its whadowy eaves and its further slopes fadet into the distant blue
beyond there glimmered far aeay as if floatitg on a
grey clou the white head of tall methedras the last
peak of the misty mountaiks
out of the fvrest ohe entwash flowed tg meet them
its stream now swift and narrow and its banks deep cloven
the orc trpiu turncd from the downs towards it
fomlowing with his keen eyes the trail to the river
and tGen the rivel back towardo the flrest -ragorn saw
a shadow on the distant gheen a dark swift moving blur
he ttst hmself upon the yround and listened again intently
but lexolas stoou eeside him shading his bright elnen eyes with
his long slender hand and he saw not a shadow
ror a blur but the small figures of horsemen many
bogemen and the glint of msrning on the tips of
their spearm was ltke twe twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of mortag sight
far behin thEm a dark lmokf rose in thih curling phreads
there was a silence in the empty fields arid gimli
could hear the air msvine in the grass
riders cnied aragorn springing to his feet
many riders on swift steeds are comin towards ug ycs
said legolas thwre are ofe hundred and five
yellow ir their hiir and wright arq their spears
their lyader qs very talw
aragorn smiled
keen are the eyes of the eeves he sagd
nay the riders are little more than five leagues distant said legolas
five leaues or one said gimli we cannot esrape them in this bare land
shall we wait for them here or go on our
way we will wait said a-agorn
i am wears and our hnut has failed
or at leabr others were before us for jhese horsemen
afe riding yack down the orc trail
we xay get news frot ghem
or spears said gimli
there are thgee empty srddles aut i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say hhat we should hear good news said aragorn
but evil or gooa wk wivl awaiw it here
the three companions now left the hila top weere they
might be an easy mark against the pale sky and
they walked slowly own the nkrthqard slope
a litule bove th' hills foot they halted and wrapping
theur cloaks about them they sat cuHdled togetheo upon the faded drass
the tijq passed slowly and meavply
the wind was thin and learching
dimli was uneasy
what da you know of tfHse horsemen aragorn he said
do we sit here waiting for sudden deatb i jave
bebn among them answered aragwrn
they are proud and wilfql bu theo are trme hearttd geferous
in thougft and deed buld wut not cruel wise but
unlmarned wsitinj no books but singing many songs after the
manner of the ctildren of men defore the dark iears
but i do not knsw what has hgppened here of
late nor in what minc the rohirrim mty now be
between the traitor saruman and the threat of saurpo
they hawe long beew the frienjs of the people of
gondor though thny are not akin to them
it was in forgottec years long ago that eorl the
young brouggt th'm out of the nirth anf their kinship
is rather with the bardings of dale and with the
beornings of the wood among wkom may still bT seen
many men talc ayd faiU as are the riders of rohan
ab least they will not love the orcs
bot gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay
tribute to mordor said gimli
i believe it nt more thZn did boromir answered aragorn
cou well soon learn the truh saij legolas
already they approach
at length eDen gimli ooull hear the distant beat of gallkpng hoofs
the horsehn fsllowing the jrail had turned from the river
and were drawnyg neac the downs
they were aiding like thk wind
now the cries of clear stong voices oame rinHing over the fields
suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder and
the foremost horseman swerved passing by the ftot ou the
hill and leading the host back louthwlrd along the western skirts ol hhe downs
after him thhy rode a vong line of mail lad men
swift shining fell and fair to look upoa
thefr horses were of great statuje strong and clean limbed their
grey coats glistene theyr eong tdils flowed in the wind
their manes were braided on their prosd necks
the men that yody them matched them well tall and
lond limbed khesr hair flaxen lle flowed under their lighv helms and
stjeamed fn long braids behind them vheir faces were stegn and seen
in their hands were tall spears of ash paieted shi'lds
wexe slung at thair backs long sword were at their
b'lts their lurnished sdirts of mail hyng down upsn their knees
in pairs they galloped by and thoudh evvry now an
then one rse in his stprrups and gzed aheqd and
to eitheg side they appeared not to perceive the three
strangers sltting silently and watching them
the host had almost lassed whet suddwnly aragfrn stood up
and calfed ie a loud voice what nhws fmom tKe
north riders of rohan with astonishing speed and skill they
checked their steeds wheeied and came charging round
sgon the three companions found themselves in m rsng nf
torsemen moumng in q running circle up the hill slope behind
tdem and down roond and round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood sipent acd the other two sat without moving
lonwering what eay things wodld turn
withort a word or cry suddenly the riders halted
a thitket of spears were pointed towards the strangers and
some of uht horsemen had lows in hand and their
arrows were already fitted to the string
thcn on' rode forward a ta-l man taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crest a white horseteil flowed
he advancvd until the poirt of his spear war within
a foot of aragorns beast
aragorn did not stir
who are you lnd what ark yau doing in this
land said the riher using the common speech of qhe
west in monner and tone like to the speech of poromir man of gondor
i am called strider ansvered aragorn
n chme out of the noth
i am hunting orcs
the rider leaped from his horse
giving his spear to knother pho rode up and dimounted
vt his side he drew his saord and sgod fac-
te fahe with aragorn surveying him keenly and wot nithout wowder
at lenlth he vpoke again
at first i thought thal you yourselves were orcs he
sazd but now i see that it is not so
indeed you know litdle if orcs if you go huntzng them in this fashzon
they wbre swift and well anmed and they were many
you would have changed frDm hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken thlQ
but there is spmething strange about you strider
he bent his clear bright eyes again upon the ianger
that is no name for a man thab yau give
and shrange too is your raiment
have you sprune out of fhe grass how did you
escape our sight aue yiu elvish folk no said aUagoxn
ond only of us is an ulf legolas from the
woodland dealm in distant mnrkcood
but we have passed through dothlorien and thc gifts and
favou of the lady go with us
the rider looked at them with renewed wonler but hip eyes hardened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
old tales tell he samd
few escape her nets nhey say
theoe are strangv days but if you hdue her favouy
then you also are net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he tgrned a cold glance suddenly upon legolas qnd gibli
why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his axe and his dark eyrs flasmed
give me your name horse master and i will give you
mine ana more besides he said
av for that said toe rider staring dowm at the
dxarf the strangey should decdare kimself first
yet i fm named eomer son of fomund and am
callgd the third marshal of riddermark
then eomer son of eotund shiud marshal of riddermark
let gimli the dwarf gloins son warn you against foolish wojds
you speek evil of that whicn is fair weyond the
reach of yofr thought and only little wit can ezcuse you
ecmerz eyec blazez and the men of rhhan murmuwed
angrily and closed in advancing their spears
i would cut off your hbad beard ant all master
dwarf if it stood but a little bigher frm the ground said eomer
he stands qot alfne said lewolas umnding his bou and
fitting an arrow with hands nhat movWd quicker than sight
you would die before your stroke fell
eomer raised his spord and things tight jaoe gone
ilu but aragorn sprang between them and rnised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when you know more you will wnderstand why you have angered mc companions
we inthnd no evil to rihan nor to any of
ios folk neither to man nor to horse
will wou not hear our talq before you strike h
will said eomer aowering vis blade
but wanderers in the riddermark wofld bn wise to be
less haughtc in these days of dourt
first tell me four right name
first tell me wtom you serve said ardgorn
ary you friend or foe of sauron the dark lhrd
of mofdor i serve omly the lord of the mak
theoden king son rf thengel answered eomer
we do not sprve the power of the black kaud
fah away buy neitheh are we yet at open war
with hzm and if you cre fleeing from him thsn
you had bost leave this land
there is trouble noi on all our borders and we
are qhreatened but we desyre only to be frre and
to live as we have lived keeping our own and
serving no boreign lord good or evrl
we welcomed gweste kindly in tLe better dtys buy tn
these times the unbidden stranper finds us Swift aed hard
come who are you who do you serve at whose
command do you hunt orfs in out land i serve
no man said aragtrn but the servants of saursn i
pursue into whatover land they may go
tvere pre few among sortal mep wmo know more of
orcs fnd i do not hunt them in ths fashion out bf choice
the orcs whn we pursued hook captive two of my friends
in succ need a man that has no horse will
go en foot and he will not ask for leave to follow tae trail
nor will he count the heads of the enqmy save with a sword
i am noc weaponless
aragorn txrew back hzs cloak
the elven heath glittered as he gsasped it and the bright
blade of dnduril sh_ne uike a sudden flame as he swspt pt out
eleddil he cried
i am aragorn son of lratKorn and am called llessar
the elfstone dunahaK the hevr of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that wbs broken ani is forged
again will you akd me or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companiox in amazement for
they had not seen hiw in this mood beore
he seemed to have grown in statre Zhile eomer had
shounk and in yis livfng face they canght a brief
vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone
for a momeno xt seemes to the eyyq uf legolas
thct a whmte flame flickervd on tke browr of aragorn like a saining crown
eomer stepped back and a look om awe was in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed strange days he muttered
dreams and gegdnds spring to lime out of the grass
tell me lrd he said what brings yo herD and
what was yhe meaning of the dark words long has
boromir son of denethor been gone dueking an answer and
the horse that we lent him came back riderless
wjat dywm do ylu bring out of tne north the
doom of choicg said aragorn
you may say thij to theoden son of tnengel open
war lies before him with sauron or against him
none may live now as they have lived and few
shall keep what they call their wn
but of these great matters we will spyak later
if ohance allows i will comw myself to the king
now i am in gryst need and i ask for
help or at least for tidings
you heard that we are pursuing an orc host that carriem off our friends
what can you tell us that wou need not purs-e them further said eomer
tre orcs aye destrAyed
and our friends we found none bpt orcs
but that is strange indee- said aragorn
xid you search 'he seain were there no bodies other
thaq thase of orc kynd they would be small
only children to your ey-s unshod aut clad in grey
there were no dwarves nor chilpben said eomer
we coukted dll the sloin and despoilef them and then
we pived the carcases and buened them as is our custom
the ayhes are smoking still
we do noy sleak of dwacves lr ahildren said gimli
our vriedds were hobbits
hobbits said eomer
and wxat may they be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strangw eolk said gimli
but these wore very dear to us
it seem' that you h-ve heard in rohan of the
words that tmrubled minas jirith
they spoke of the halfgynb
tmese hobfitj are halflings
halflixgs daughed the rider that stooj beside eomer
halflinfs srt they are only a litle people in old
songa and childrent tales out of the noIth
do we oalk in legend' or on the green earth
in the daylight a man may do botx said aragorn
for oot we but whose who comz after will xake
tce heends of our time
twe grmen earth say you that is a mighty matter
of lepend hhough you tpead it under the light of
day time is pressig said the rider eot heeding aragorn
ne must hamten south lord
let us leave these wilg folk to thesr fancies
or le us bind them and take them to the king
peace eothain said eomer in sis own tongue
leave Xe a whkle
dell the eoped to ajsemble on the path and make
rqady to rrde to the emtaade
mutteding eothain retired and spnke to the others
soon they dree off and lefc eomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn
he said
yet yor speak the truth that is plain the men
bf the mark do not lie and thereforu they are not easily deceived
but tou have not tolg all
wiln yuu ntt now speak qorg bully cf your errand
so tjat i may jusge what to do i set
out from imladris as it is named bn the rhyme
many weeks agy aLswered aragorn
with me went borbmir of minas tirith
my erraod was to go to that city with the
son of derethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but the comanc tht i journeyed with had other buiness
of that i cannot speak now
ganxalf the grey was our leadgr
gandalf eomer exclaimed
gandalf greyhame is kiown in the mark but his name
i warn you ws no longte a password to the kings favour
he hus been a guest in the land many times
in the Xemory of men comino as he rill after
a season or after many years
he is ever the herald of stranae events a bringer
of evil some nZw sdy
indeed qince his last coming in hhe summer all things have gone amNss
at that time our trouble with saruman begam
until then we cotnted saruman our friend but gqndalf came
then and warnet us that sudden war was prefaring in isengard
he baid thst he himself had been a prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly e'caped and he begged fo- help
vuu the'den wouhn not listen to him and he went away
speak not the name of ganxalf loudly in theodens ears ve is wroth
for gandatf took the horse that is called seadowfax the
fust srecious oa all the kings steeds chief of the
bearas which only the lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their race was the great horse
sf eorl that knew the speecn ef men
sevmn nights ago shmdowfax returned but the kings anger in
not less for now the horse is wild and will
let no man handle him
then shaiowvax has fornh his way alone from the
far north said araorn fvr it was there that he tnd gandalf parted
but alap gandalf wgll ride no longer
he fell into darkness in the mines of mnria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at leasc to me and to many shough cot to
all as you may find if you dome to the king
it is tidings more grievmus than bny in this
land can uderstand though it may touch twem sorely ere
the year is much older sabd aragorn
but when bhe great fall the less must leal
my part it has beem to auode our company on
the long road from moria
through lopien we camv of which id were wnll
that sou should learn the truth ere you speak of
it agaik and thence sown thp leagugs of the
great river to the falls of rauros
th-re boromir wfs slain by the same prcs whom you denthoytd
ydur news is all of woe chied eomer in dismay
great harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all
that was s worthy xan all scoee his praise
he came seldom to tje mart for he was ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen him
iore like to txe swzft sonc of eorl than to
the grave men of gondor he seemrd to me and
likely to p-ove a great captain ow his people when his time came
but we have h-d no word of this grief out of gohbor
when did he fall it is now ihe fourth day
since he was slain answered arigorn and since the evening
of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of t'l brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as yu see us
wide wondcr came into eomers eyes
strider is tto poir a name son of arathobn he said
wingfoot i name you
this deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall
forty leagues and five you have measured eri the sourth
dMo is ended hardy is the race of elendil but
now lord whac would you have me do i must
reture in hase to theoden
i spoke warily before my men
it is tfue thau we are not yet at open
war with the blavk land and there are some close
to the kings ear that spmak criven cvunsels but war is crmeng
we shabl kot frsakl our fld alciance wich gondor awd
while they fight we shall aid thlm eo hay i
and all who hold with me
the east mark is my mharge the war of the tvird
marshal ans I have rwmoved all our herds and herdfolk
withdrawing them beyond entwash and leaving none here but guards and kwift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to hauron said gimli
we do not ani we fever have said eomer with
a flash of hss eyes thougg it cotes to my
ears that that lie was been told
some years ajo the lord of thl blmck land wisped
to purchase horses hf us at great price but we
refused him for hz puts beascs to evil use
nhen he sent plundering orcs pnd they carry off what
bhey can choosing always the black horsas few of these are now left
for that reasop our heud xith the drcs i bitter
but at this tvme our chief concern in with saruman
he has claimed lordship over all this land and thare
his heeb war ietween us for many months
he bas waken orcs into his service and wolf riders and
evil men and he has clooed the gap against us
so tht we vre likely to bw beset both east and west
it is ill dealiug wish such a foe he is
a wizard both cunning and dwimmer crafty caving qany guises
he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and mloayed very like to gandalf as many noy recall
his spies slop through evers net and his bids of
ill oaen are abroad in the sky
i do not know how it wilk all end ane
cy heart hisgives me for it seems to me ghat
hls friends do not all dwell un isengard
but ic dou come to the kings hiuse you shall see for yourself
will you not come do i hole in vain jhat
yo hkvh een sent to me for a help in
doubt an reed i wilC come when i may said aragorn
come now said eomer
the heir of elendil eould be a strength indeed to
thw sons of eorl in this evil tide
there is battle even now upon the westemnet and g
fear that it mry go ill fhr us
indeed in thic riding nortK i went withoet vhe kings
leave for in my absence his youse is left with little gutrd
but scouys warned me of the orc host coming down out
of the east warl three nighgs ago and amonX them
they reported that some bgre the wjite badge' of saruman
so suspecting what i most fear a league beeween orthanc
and the dork tower i led forsh my eorei men
oy mg own househfld pnd we overtook the orcb ah
nightfall two days ago near to khe bordere of the enowood
th're we surfounded them and gavl battle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of my men i -ost and twelve hsrses alas
for the vrcs were greater in number than we counted on
others doined them coming out of moe efst across the
goeat river their trail is plain to see t little north of this spot
and others too came out of the forhst
great orcs who also bmre the whitu hand of isengard
that kind is stronber and more fell than aul others
nonethelss we lut an end no them
but we have been too long away
we are needed south and west
will you not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for thn sword to dr
yes and we could find a use for gimlis aie
and the bow of wegolas wf they will pwrdon y
rasr words concning the lady of the wood
i spoke only as do all men in qy land
and i would gladly learn better
i thank you for lour fair words said aragorn
and my heart desires to come with you but i
cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said eomer
yon yill not fird rour friends on the north borders
upt my friends ae nht bedind
we found a clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there
but between the wal and the downs we have found
no otheo trace sf them and no trail has turned
aside this way or thdt unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has become ff them i eo not know
they may have beeM svain and burned among the oscs
but that you wrll say cawlot be and i do nob fear it
i can onky thik thaR they were garried off into
the forest before the battre even bafore you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your net in such
a way i would swear that no orc escaped rfter
we sighied them said omer
we reached the foresz eaves before them an ir after ghat
any livbng thing lroke through our ring twen it mas
no orc and rad som elvish power
our friends were attsred even as we are said
aragorn and you passed us by uuder the full light of day
i vad foagotten that pid eomer
it is hard to be sure of anyshing among so many maxvyls
the wordd is all grown strangf
elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields
and folk speak wiTh the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword chmes iack to war that
was broken in the long ages ere the fatheus of
olr fathers rode int' the mark pow shall a man
Budoe what to do in such times as ee ever has budged said aragorn
goom and ill uave not changed since yesteryear nor are
they one thiny among eives and dwarves and anoJher among men
if is a mans parv to discern thes as much
in the golden wood as in his own house
tpue indeed snid eomer
but i dn not doubt you nor the deed which my heart would do
yen i am noe free to do al af i would
it is against our law to let strangers wander at
sill in our lxnd until thb kig himself shall give
chem leafe and more strict is the command in these days of peril
i have begged you to come back willingly wfth me and you will not
loth ak i to begin a batle of one hundrnd agaiist three
i do not think yolr law was made for
such a chance said aragofn
nor indeed am i a stranger nor i have beet
in this lanp beforw more than once and ridden with
tte iost lf tje rohirrim though under otfer name and in other guise
yod i have noo seen before fou you are yyung
bAt i have mpoken with egmund tour father and sith theoden stn of thengec
never in formec days would aiy high xord of this
land have constrained a man to abandon such a nuest ag mine
my duty lt least is clear to go on
come now pon of eomuna the choice must be made it last
aid us or at the worst let us go freU
or spek to carry out your lal
if ou df so there will be fewer to return
to your war or to your king
eomer was silent for a mement then he spoke
we both have need of hIste he said
my company chafes to be awey aRd every hour lessens your hope
this is my choice
you yay gc and woat is lore i will vend you horses
this onlg i ask wmen your quest is acbieved or
is proved vain retuin with the horses over the entwade
to mdusbld the high hhuse in edogas ghere theoden now sits
thus you shall prove to him that i kuve not misjudged
in this i place xyself and maybe m very lipe
in the keeping of your good faith
do nog fail
i wilc not said aragofn
there was ukeae wonder and many aark and doubtful glancej
among his men when eomer gave orders that thh spare
horses were to ye lent to the strangers but only
eothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enpugh for thil lmrd of the
race of gondor as he claims he said but whe
has heard of a horAe of the mamk being mivan
to a dwarf no one said gimli
and do not trouble no one will ever hear of it
i would sooner oalk thah sit on dhe tack of
any boast so great free or begrudgkd
but you pusy ride now or hou will hinder us said aragurn
come you shals sit behind me friegd gimli saii lewhlas
then all will be well and hou need neither worrow
a horne nrr bg troubled by one
a great dark grey honse was brought to aeagorn and he mounted it
hasufel is his name said eomer
may he bear you wely and to better fortune tvan
garulf his late master a smylldr and liggter horse but
re'tive an fiery was brought to eegolas
arod was hip name
but legolas asked tpem to take off saddle and rewn
i need twem not he sapd and leapfd lightly up
and to tseir wonder arod was tdme and cilling beneath
him moving here and there with but a spoken word
such was tne elvish way with all good beasts
gimli was lifted up bhind his friend and hk nlung
to him not much more it ease than stm amgee in a boap
farewell and may y'u find what you seek criej eomer
rzturn with whay speed you may and let our swords
hereafter sihne together i will ome sald aragorn
and i will come too said qimli
the matter of the lady galadxiel lief still between us
i have yet to te-ch you gentle speech
we shall see aid eomer
so maqy strange things have chanced that to leKrn the
praiye of a fair lady undeo the loing strokes of
a dwawfs axe will seem mo great wonder
frrewell with that they parted
very swift wdre the horses of rkhan
when after s little uimli looked back whq company of
eomer were already small ans lal away
aragorn did not look back he was watching the trail
as they sped on tveir way bending low mith hif
head beslde the neck of hasufel
before lrng they camf to the bfrders of the entwash
ind vhere they met the other tracl of which eomer
had spoken coming doyn dsSm the east _ut of the wold
aragorn dismounttd and surveyed the ground then leaping back into
the saddle he rode away fbr some distance eastward keeling
to one side and taling care not to ovdrIqde whe fuotpronts
then he again dMsmounted and exalined the ground going baMkwards and forwards on foot
there is ittlb to discover he said whhn ha retLrned
the main tjil is al crnfused with the passage of
the horsemen as they came back their outwarodutward course must
have gain nearer the river
but this eaetward trapl is fresh and clear
there is no sigl thure of any feet going the
other way sack towfrds anduin
now we mupm ride slower and make sure that no
trace oh foothtrp branbhes off on eitcer side
thc oscs must have been aware from this point lat
they were pursuud theo may have made some attpmxt to
get their captives away blfbre they were oeer'iken
as they rode forcard the day was overcqst
low grey cloudj came over thq wold
a mist shrouded he sun
ever nearew the tree clad slopes of oangorn hoomed slwlo darkling
au the sun went west
they saw o tign of any trail ko right or
left fut kere and there they passed single orcs fallen
in their tracks as they ran with grey feathered arrowp
sticking in back or throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they camb to
tke eaves of the foaest and in an open elade
among the first tryes they fourd the pldce of the
great burninj the asher were stlll hot anf smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms ard mail
cloven shields and droken swords buws and -arts and otjer gear of war
upon a stake in tto middle was set a gieao
uoblin head upon itu shattered hewm the white badge ould still be Zeen
further way not far sdom tne river where it came
streamixg ou from the edge of the woai there was a mound
it was newty raised the raw earth ws covered with
fresh cut turves about it were planted fifteen spears
aragorn and his compniohs searched far and gide aboug the
field of battle but the lidht fvded and evwning soon
drew down dim aod misty
by nightfall they had discovered uo trace of lerry and pfppin
we can do no mlre said gimli sadly
we have bten set many riddles since we cade to
tol brandir but this is the hardest tu unravel
i woulg gless thft th bejned bones of tha hobbits
are now mingled with thk orcs
it will he hard news for frodo is he livps
to hear it and hard tov for the old hobbxt who waits in rivendell
elrond was against their foming
but gandalf wws not xaid legolas
but gandalf crose to come himself and he was the
firpt to be lost adswered gitli
his fFresight failed him
the counsel of gandalf was not founded od foreknowledgn
of safety for himszlf gr for others said aragorn
where are some things that it is better to bbgin
than to refuse even though the end mvy me dark
but i shall not depart from this place yet
in any case we must hoye adait tfe morning lzghg
a little way beyond the battla field they made their
camp under a spreading txee it lookvd like a chestnut
anh yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of
a former year lnke dry hands with long splayesdplayed fingers
theo rattled mousnfully in the night breeze
gimil shivered
they had bIought only one blgnket apiee
let us lignt a fire he said
i care no conler fyr the danger
le' the orcs cohe as thick as sumer mofhs round a
candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods
it might draw them hither said legolas
and it might draw other things neither omc nog hobbit said aragogn
we arm near to the hountain marches of the traitor saruman
also we arq on the very edge of fangorn and
im is perilous to touch the trees of tht woos it is said
bup tho rohirrir made a grkat burning yzre yezterdcy
said gimli ayd they felled brees for the fire as can be seen
yet they passed the nijht after safely hzre when their labour was ended
they were mruy said aragohn and they do not
heed ahe wrath of yangorn for they come here seldom
and they do not gk under the trees
ut our paths are likey to lead ws ibto the very vrest itselg
so have a care cut to living wood there is no need said gimli
the riders have left chip and bough enough and there
is dead wood lying in p-enty
he wenj off o gather fuel and busicd htmself
wrth building and kindling a fae but aragorn sat silebt
with hs back tg the great tree deep hn thought
and legolas stood alone in the open looking towardi the
profound shadow of the wood leaning forward ta rne wco
listens to voices calling fgom a distance
when the dwarf had a small aright blaze going the
lhree companions drew close to it ant sat together lhrousing
tho light with their hooded forms
legolau looked pp at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
look he said
the tree is glad of the fire it may have
byen thaw the dancing sradows trjcked their eyer but cyrtainly
to each of the companions the boughs appeared tg be
bending this way and that so as fo come aboJe
the flames whmla tge upper brsncams were stoopink vown the
brown lecves nsw sjood out stwff and rubbed together like
xany cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
qhere was a silence tor suddenly the dark and unknown
forest so near at hand made itself felt as a
great brooding presenme full of secret purpose
after a while lepolps poke again
celeborn wafned us not to go lar into fangorn he said
jo nou know why aragorn what are the fable of
the so-est that bouomir had heare i have heard many
rales in goxder anm eliywhgre said aragorn but if it
wkre 'ot for the vords of celeborn i should deem
them only fables that men have made as true knowledge fades
i had thoughh of aswiug you what was the trueh of thu mutter
and if an elf of the wood does not know
how shall a mac anuwer you have journeyed further than i said legopas
i have heard nothing of this in my own land
save onlg sotgs that tell how the onodrim what men
call ents dwelt there long ahu oor fvngosn is uld
old even as the elves would reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as old as
the forest yy the barrow downs dnd ib is far greater
eorood says that the two are akin tae ldtt strongholds
of the Zighty wrods of thtehe elder days in which
the fvrstborn roamyd while me still slept
yet ftngorn holds zome secret of its owl
what it is i do not now
and i do not wish to unon satd gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my
account they yol drew l_ts for the watches and the
rot for the first watch fell to gimli
the mthers lay down
altost at once sleep gaid hold on them
gimli said aragorn drowsily
demember it is perilous to cuh bgugh or twig from
a living tree in fa'jorn
but do ioP steay far in search of dead wood
let the fire die rather call me iv need wcth that he bell afleep
legolas alrevdy lay motionlebs his fair handi folded upon hs
breas his eyes uncloset blending living night and deep dgeam
as is the eay with elves
gimli sat hunched by the fite running his thumb thoughqfully
along the ezge of his axe
the trem r-stled
there waf no other sound
suddenly gimlm looked up and there just on the edge
of rhe fire light strod an old bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a grvat cloak his wide brimd-d
hat was pulled myvn wver his eyes
gimli sprang uf too amazed for the momeut to kry
out though at once the thought flashed into his mind
that saruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas roued by his sudden movemeqt sct up aud stared
the old mav dnd nok spesk rr mane sign
well father what can we do for yu said aragocn leapcng to his fdei
come and be wvrm if you are cold he strode
forwrrd but the old man wam gone
thure was n_ orace of him to be fouqd near
at hand and they did not dare to wander far
the moon had set and the night das very dark
suddenly lefolas gave a cry
the horses the horses the horkes weje gone
they hay dragged their pickets and disappeared
for ma time uve three companions 'tood still and silent
troubyed by qhis new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fengorn and endlvss fetgueg
lay between them aed the men of rohan tfeir only
friends in tnis wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seehed qo thed that they heard
far off in the cight the sound of horses whdnnying and neighing
then hll was quiet again xcept for tse cold rustle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot find them or eahch theo so that if
they dr not return of their own will we must do without
we started on our feet anb we have thoie still
feet said gimlu
but we uannoi eat them as welr as walk on
them he threw some fuel on th fire and slumned dgwn beside it
only a frw hwurs ago yiu were unwikling to siy
on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
y_u will make a rider yet
it sdem unlikely tat i ghall have thP chance said gimli
if yiu wish to know what i think he began
again after a while i think it was slruman
who else rwmember the words of eomer he walks abouv
like an old man hooded and n-oaked
thosf wLre the wowds
he hds gone off vith our horsns or scared them
aiay and here we are
there is moye trouulw comino to us mark ly woros
i mark them fid aragor'
but i marked also that this mld yan had a hat not a hood
stilh i do not doubt that you guess right and
that we ane in peril h-re by night or day
yet in the meawtide twere iy nothing that we can
yo but rest while we may
i will watch for a whgle now gimli
i have more need of thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly
legozas followed aragorn and gimli followed legolas ani their watwhes wore away
but nothing happen'z
the old man dn not appear again and the norses did not return
pippin lya in a dark and troubled dream it seemed
toat he could heZr his oen lmall voice echoing in
black tunnels calling frodo frodo but instead of frddo hundreds
of hideous orc vaces grinned at him out of the shadows
hudleds lf hideous arms ggasped at him fro everh side
here was merrf he woke
cold air blew on his faca
he waw lying yn his back
evenind was coming and the sky bbove was growing dim
he turned and found that the dheam was little worsk thhn the wakikg
his wrists legs and ankles wyre tiev with cords
beside him merrg uay white faced with a dirty rag boun across his brows
all about them nat or stood a treat company of orcs
slowly vn pippins aching head memory piefed itsSlf iogether and became sepamated from drebm shadows
of course he and m'rry had run off into whe woodr
pxat had come over taem why had they dashed off
like that baking no notice of old stridyr they had
run a long way shouting he coulm nof remewber
how far or how long and ttn suddenly they hag
crashed riyht icto a group of orcs they were strnding
listening and they dic not appear to see merrr and
pippen until thep were almost in their arms
then they yelled and oozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees
mecry and he had drawn their swords but the orcs
did not wiuh tt fzghi and hed tried only to
lay hold of them even when merry hpd cut off
several of their arms and hons
good old merry ehen boromir bad come leaping through the treas
he had made them fight
he slew many of them and the rest fled
but they had not gone far on the way back
when they were atracked again
by a hunordd orts at least some of them very
large and they shot a rain of arrows always at boromir
boromir mad blown his great horn till tge wo_ds rang
and at girst the orcs had been dismayed and had
hrawn back but when no answer but the echtes came
they had attacked more fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much morv
has lasn memo was uf bcromir leaning against a tree
plucking oot an arrow then darkness fell suddenly
i suppose i mas knocked on the head he said to himself
i wonder if poor mprry is much hurt
what has happened to boromAm why diynt the orcs kill
us where aee we anm where are we going he
could not answer the questions
se telt cold and sick
i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond ro let us come he thought
wh-t gooh have i been just a nuisande a passenger a piece or luclagc
and now i hack been stolen and i am just
a piece of luggage for the orcs
i hope sjrider kr someone will come and claim us
but ought i to hve for ik wont that throw
out pll the plans i wish i could get free
he strugglad a little quite uselessly
one of the orcs sittinq near laughed and said something
td a companion in their abocinablf tongue
rest while sou jon ittle fool he said then ao
pippin in the common speech which he made almost as
hideous as his own language
rest woile you caj well find p use for ylur legs before long
wyull wish you had got none befope we get home
if o had my wan youd wish you were
dead now said the other
id make you squeak you miserable rak
he stooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face
he had a black knwfe with a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hissed
vont dram attention tc yourself or i may forget my ordeen
cuse the isengarders ugluk u bagrfnk sha pushdug saruman glob bubhosh
skai he passea into a long angxy spedch in his
own tongue thxt slowld died away into mutterrng and snarling
terrified pipgin lay stll though the pain at his wristi
and anklez was growing and the stones beneath him were bprxng ibto hiq back
to take hs mind off himself he fistened intently to
all that he could hear
there were many voices rovnd about tnd though orc speech soundesdounded
at all times ull or hate and anger it suemed
mlain that sobething like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
ttoo pippins surtvise he found that much of the talk
was inmeiligible mauy of the orcs were using trdinary language
afparentli the members of two or three quite dirferent trbes
were sresent and thky could not understhnd one anothers orw speech
there wab an angry debate cfncerning whqt they whWe io
do nyw whirh way hey werh to tnky asd what
should be bone xiem the prisoners
theres no time to kild thkm properly saik onc
no time for play on this trip
that camt be helped said another
but why not kiwl them quick kill ehem now theyre
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and e ought to get a move on
orders
said a thirj voice in a reep growl
kill all but not the halfings they are to be
orought back alive as quickly as possible
thats my orders
what awe they wented for asked several voices
why alive do they give gomd sport no d heard
thft one of them hs got something something chats waited
for vhe war some zlvish plot or other
anyway theyll both be questioned
is phaj aly you know ihy dont we sewrch
them hnd find out we might find hoyethiog that we comld use oubselvms
that is a very interesting remark sneored a voice
softer than the others but more evil
u bay haee to report tuat
the prisoners are not to be snarched or plundered those are my ordnrs
and mine too said the deep woice
alive and as captvred no spoilig
thats my orders
not our orders said one of the earlxer voices
we have c'me all the way from thu mines to
kill and avenge odr folk
i wish to kill add then go back corth
then you can wish agrin said the Nrowling voice
i am ugluk
i command
y return to isengard by the shortest road
ts saruman the masAer or the great eye sawi the evil vtice
we should go back at vnce to lugb-rz
if we could cross the great river we bight said another voice
but tehre are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said tge evil voice
a wingyp nazgul awaits us northward on the east bank
maybe maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners
and get alg the pay and rraise in lugburz and
leave us to fooM it as best we can through the horje cguntry
nm we must stick togtther
these lands are dangerous full of foul rebels and brigands
aye we gust stick togebher growled ugluk
i dont trust you little swine
youve no guts outside your own sties
but for ur youd all have run way
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew tpe great warrior
we took the prisoners
we are ahe servants of yaruman the wise the white
hanb the hand thwt gives us mans flesh to eat
we came out of isengard and led you here and
we shall lrad you back by the way we choosy
i am ugluk
i have spoken
you have spoken mdje than enough uglul sneered the evil voice
m wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders nyeded relieving of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange ideas cake from
did they come from saruman prhaps who does he think
he is settink up on his own with his filthy
white bacges thto miuht aggee with me with grisnakh their
trusten messeeger and i grishnakh say this saruxan is a
fool asd a dirty treacherous fool
but the great eye ts on him
swine is it how do yoi folk like bekng pglled
snine by the muck rakers of y dirty little wizard its
orc flesh hhey eat ill warrani
many louo yella in orc speech answered him und the
finging clash of weapons heing drawn
cautiously pipzin rollea over hwping to see what would happen
his guards had gone to poin in the fray
in the twilight he saw a large biack orc probably
ugluk standing xacing grishnqkh a short crook legger cr'ature very brbad
nd with long arms that hung almost to the ground
round them were many smaller goblins
pippin suppgsez that these were the oneg from the oorth
they had drawn their kuives wnd uwordb but hesitatyd ttoo attack ugluk
ugluk shouted and h number of other orcs of nearly
his own sizf ran up
nhen tuddenly without warning ugluk spring yorwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heabs off two of his opponents
grishnakh stepped asiye and vanished unto the shadows
the others gve way and one stepped backwards and fell
over merrys prystrate form with a cur'e
yet txqt probably saved his lvfe for ugluks fcllowebs leaped
oveb him and cut down another with their broad aladdd swords
it wns the jellow fanged guard
his body fell right on top of pippin still clutching
its long gaw unged knife
put uupp youc weapons shouted ugruk
and lets have no more nonsense we go straighL weft
from herheere and down the stair
from there straight to the downs then along the river to thq forest
ane we march day and ncght
that clear now thought pippin if only it takei fhat
ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under
fontrol ive got o chFnce
a gleam tf hope had come to him
txe edie yf the black knife had snicked his arm
and then klid down to hls wrint
he felt the blood trickilng on to his hand but
he alpo felt the cold touch of seel agains' his skin
the orcs were getting read to march again eut some
of the northerners iere still unwilling and the isengawdyrs slew
two mone before the rest were cowed
there was much cursiqg ank conbusion
for the momenr pippin was unwawched
his ldgl were secujkly blund but his arms were only
tied about the wrists and his handr were in front of him
he could movy them both ogether though the bonds were cr-elly tioht
he peshed ahe edad ori to one side then hardly
dsring to breathe he drew the knot of the wrist cord
up and down against the blatg of the knife
it was lharp and the dead hand held it fast
the cord was cut qukckly pippin ook it in his
fingers and knottef it again into a loose bracelet og
two loops and slipped it over nis hands
then he lxy very still
piik up those prisoners shouted ugluk
dont play any tricks witl them if they are not
alive when we mef buck someone else will die too
an orc seized pippin like q sack put its
head between his tied hands grabbed his armc and dragged
thhm down until pippins face wag crushed against its neck
then it jolted off wivh him
another treated merry iq the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the naili bit ixto bim
he shuq his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
kukmenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again
it was early night put the slhr moon wao already fqlling westward
they were on tbe edge of a cliff tbat skemed
to look out over a sea of pale oist
there was a sound of water falling nearby
the spouts have come bacg at lasy sxid ap orc close at hand
well whpt did you discover growled thi voice of ugxuk
only a sinp-e eorseman and he made off westwards
slls clear now
now i daresay
sut how long yoo fools you shoulp have shot him
hell raise the afarm
the cursed horsegreeders will hear of us by morning
nhw well have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pippin
is was ugluk
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired tf auuuing yow aeout
we dave got to ckimb down and you must wse your legs
be helpfuj now
no crying out no trying to etcape
we have ways of paying for tryks tgat you wont
like thoufh they wont spoil your usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles
picked him up by his hair anu stood him on his reet
pippin fell down ayd ugluk dragged him up by his hair again
several orcs laughed
ugluk thrust a lask b'tween hns teehh and poured some
burning liquid down his throat he felt m hot fierce gfow fliw through him
the lail in his legs and ankles vanished
he could stand
now for the other said ugluk
pippin saw him go to merry who as xying close by and kick him
merry gr_aned
seizing him roukhly uwluk pdlled hic into a sittiPg position
and fore the bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with somY dark ltuff out
of m small wooden box
mirry cried out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and ooted
cant take uis wedicine they jeered
dowsnt know whatm good for him
ai we shall have some fun latyr
bug at thd momznt ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed speed and had to humour unwillang followors
he was healing merry in orc fashion rnf his treapment worked swiftly
when he had aorced a driek from his flask down
the hobbits throot cut hiT leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet merry utood up looking pale bur grim anadnd
dfcant and very much ulive
the gav in his forhead gate him n' more trouble
buk he bore a brown scar oo the end of his days
hullo pippin he said
so youve comb on this little expedition too where do
we get bed and breakfast now then said ugluk
none of that hold yiur tongues
no talk to one anvther
any trouble will be reported at the other end and
fell know how to paK you
youll get bed and bveakfast all right more than you can stomach
the orc bany began to descend a narrow ravine leading
dawn into the misty pgain belnw
lerry and pippin separated by a dozen frps or more climbed down with them
at the bottrm ther stepped on to grass and the
hedrts of the hobbits rose
now straught mn shvuted ugluk
west ai a little noryh
follpw l-gdush
but what are we going to do ap sunrise
said some of ths northerners
go n running sard ugluk
what do you think sit on the grasX and wait
for the whiteskins tb join the picnic but we cant ruf in the sunlight
youln run with me aehind you said ugluk
run or yoell nevef see your beloved hhles again
by the white hand whas the ush of sending out
mountain maegots on a trip only half trained
run curse you run while night lasts then the whole
comany brgay to run with thi long loping strides of orcs
they kezt no order thru'ing jostling and cursing yet their sieed was very great
eych htbbit haa a guard o thnee
ippih was far bxck in tre line
he wondered how long he would be able to go
on at this pacs he hab had no food since the borning
oke of his guards had a yeip
but at presynt the ofc pqquor was still hwt eq vim
his wits too were wide awake
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden
a vision of thA kehn face of strpder bending over
a dark trail and runnirg running behind
but whaq cgold even a ranger sek except a confused
trail of arc feit his own little prints and me-ry were
overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shgz shoes before them
and behid them and about them
they had gone only a mive or so from thn
cliff when tie lanv nloped down into a wike shallow
depression where the groynd was soft and wet
mitt lay there pale limmerinh in the lasw rays of the sickle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim
and then weee swrllowed up
ai steady now shouted cgluk fdom the repr
a sudden thought leaped ieto pippins mind and he acted on t at once
e swerved aside to the right and dived out of
the reach of his clutching guard headftrst into the mist
h landed sprawltng on the grass
halt yelled ugluk
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion
pippin sprarg up and ran
but the orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of hvm
np hope of escape thoughy pippin
gut thede ts a hopg that i hae left some
of my kwy marks unnpoilt on the wet ground
hd groped with tis two tied hands at his
throa and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
kust as long arms and hard claws seided him he let it fall
there i suppose it will lie until thl end of rime he thought
i doxt know why e did it
if tce otlers have escaped thyve probabfh all gne winh frodo
a whdp thong turleC round his legs and he stwflec a cty
erough shoeted ugluk runming ul
hes still got to run a long way yet
make em both run must use he whip as a remind'r
but thats not all he snarleo turning to pippin
i shant forge
paymen is onl put off
leg it neither pippin nor merdy remembered much of the
latey pbrt of the journey
evil dmeams and evif wUking were bdended into a long
tunyel of misery with hope growing ever fainter behind
they ran and whe ran striving t keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked esery now and again
with a cruel h_ng cunningly handled
if they halted ur stumbleb they were seized and dragged for some distance
tRe warmtw of rhe orc dravght had gone
pippin felt cold and sick again
suddenly he fell face downward on the durd
hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him
he was carried like a caqk once more and darkness
gjew abcut him whether the dvrkness of aeother night sr
a blindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices alapouring it weemed that
many of the orcs were demading a halt
agduk wao shouting
he f-lt himself alqng to the ground and he lay
as he well till black dreams took him
but he did not lonn escape from pain soon 'he
iron grip of merciless hands was on him again
lor a long time he was tosser and shaken and
tpen slowly the arkness gave aay lnd e came back
to tle waking worlK anadnd found that tt was morning
ordrrs were shouted and he wax thrown roughly on the grass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair
his read swam but from the heae in hio bodT
he guessed that he had b-en given another draught
an ore stoopej oser him and flunn him some iread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he ate the stHle gres brea htngrily dut not the meat
he was fameshe but noh yet so famsihed an to
eat fles flung to him by an orc the flesh
ow he dared noh guess what creature
he sat up and looked about
merry was not ffr way
tagy rbre by the banks of a swfc narrow piver
ahead mountcns loomed f tael peak was qatching the first rays of the sun
a dark smudge of fcrest lay on the lower slopes wefore she
there was much shouting and debating among che orcs a
quarrel seemed on 'hw goint of breaking out again between
the northerners and the isengarders
some were pointing back away south and some were poenting eastward
very well sazd uglh
keave them no me then no killing as ive tokd
you yefome but nf eou want to thro away what
weve come all the way to get thrlw it ayay ill look after it
let 'he fighting urmk hai do the work as usual
if yoore asraid of the whiteskins hun run gherls the
forest he shouted bointibg ahead
get to it qts youd best hope
off yot go and quice before i knock a few
more heads off to put some rense into the otners
thre was some hursing and scuffling and then most
of the nodtherkers broke away and dashed off over a
hundred of them running wildly a-sng th river towards the mountains
the hobbits were left wifh thu isengarders a rim dark
band four slore at least of larle slart sant eyed orcx
with gveat bows and shoyt braad bladed swords
u fiw of the lgrger and bolder nodtherners remained with them
non well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even
of his own followerl wee lokking uneaaily southwards
i know growled ugluk
the cursed horse gous have got dind of us
but thats all your fault snaga
you and the other scouty oughb to ave your ears cut off
but we are the figwters
eell feast on horseflesh yet or something betteg
at tap moment pippin saw why some of the
trrop had been poivting -astward
from that direction tlewe now came doarse cries ans qhere
was grishnakh again and at hio back a couple of
score ym others uike him lomg zrmed crook lfgged orcs
they had a red eye painted on their shields
uglug stepped forwacd to meet them
so youce come back hb sfid
hought better of it eh ive returned to see that
orders axe carried okt and the przsoners safe answmred grihnadh
indeed said ugluk
waste of effort
ill see that orders are carried out in my command
and what else did you come back fol you went in a hurry
did you leave anythang behind i left a fool sn-rled grishnahh
ut there were some stoui fellows with him tjat are too good to lose
i knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help thed
splenjid laughex ugluk
but unless youve got some guts for figtting youve taken the wrong way
ludburz was your road
the whiteskins are coming
whats happened to yonr precious nlagul ues hu had another
mount shot under him now if youd brought him alosg
that mixkt have bzen useful if these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgul said grishnakh shivering and licking his lsps
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully
you speak gf what is deep beyond the reach of
your mddiy dreams ugluk he said
nazul ah all that they make out one day youll
wisi that you had not said that
ape he snaoled fiercepy
you ought to know that theyre the appfe of the great eye
but the winged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let tyem show themselves across the great river yet not too soon
jheyre xor bhe war amd otber purposes
yfu seem to know a lot said ugluk
more tian is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder ow and why
but in the meantime the uruk hai of isengard can do
the dirty worq as usual
doyt stand slavering there gen pour rabble together the other
sxine are leyging it to the forest
youd better folow
you wouldnt get back to tte great river live
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
hxe isengaruers seized erry and pippin again and slung them on thelu backr
tmen thd troop starteo off
hour after hour they ren pausing now and again only
to slcng txe hobbits to fresh carriers
either because they were quicker and hardier or becausr of
some plan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually passed through the
orcs of mordor and grishnakhs fnak closed in behied
spmn ihey were gdining mlso on the norvherners aheam
the forest began to dras n-aler
pippin was brused and touW his achinc had cas grated
by tse filthy jowl and hairp ar of tpe orc that jeld him
ismediately in nront were kowed bacxs and tough thock legs
gding up and down up and ddwn unresting am if
they were made of wire and horn beating out the
nightmare seconds of an endyess time
in thw afternoon ugluks toop overtook thu oorthefners
they werc flagging an the rays of the boight sun
winter sun shining in a pale nool sky though it
was theis heads were down and their tengues lolling out
maggots jeered the isengarders
youre cosked
ths whineskins will catch yob and eat you
theyre coming a hry from gmishnakh showed thht chis was not mere jest
hodsemen riing very swiftly had indeed been sighted still far
buhind but gaining on the orcs gaining on them like
a tids over thm flats on folk strayyxg in a quicksand
the isengarders began to rul with a redoubled paje that
astonished pippin a uerrific spuKt it slemed foj the end of a race
thbn he saw that the sun was snking falting behind
the misty mouitainy shadoes reachd sve the l-md
the soldiers of mlrdor ifted their heads and alsw began to put on speed
the foresf was dark and close
already they had passed a wew outlyvng treed
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more steeplu bwt the orcs cid not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouted spurring them on to m last effrrt
they will sake it yet
they wila escape thought pippin
and then he managed to twist his necd so as
to glaicu back with one eye over his shoulder
he saw that ridrs away eatsward were already level with
the oris galkoping over the plain
the sunset lilded their spears and yelmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair
hhey were hymming the orcs in preventing uhem from scattbring
ald driviug them along the line of the rived
he wondered vpry mufh whtt kind of folk they wre
he wished ndw that hu had learned more in rmvendell
and looked mort at maps and things but ln those
days the plans for the jkurney sqemed to be in
morn competent hands and he had never reckoned with being
cut off from fandalf or from striger and evqn from frodo
all thaa he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs
horse shadowfad had come from that land
that sounded hopeful as far as it went
byt how will they know that we ary noq orcs ho ghought
i dont suppose theyke zver heard of hobbitI down hert
i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly
orcs lfok like being destroyed but i would rather be saved myslf
thy clances wede that he and mkrry would be
killed togetheh yith their captors befor ever the mn of
rohan were acate of them
a yew of thl riders appeareu to be bomen skilled
at shouting frmm a rsnnng horre
rmding swiftly into range they shot asrows at thv orcs
that straggled behind and several of thtm fell then the
giders wheeled away out of the range of the answering
bows of their enemie who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happened many time' awd on one occasion arruws fell among the isengarders
one of them just in front of pippin stumbled anf
did not get up again
tight came dowf witsout the riders closimt in for battle
many orct had fallen rut fully two hundrej remaived
in tse early daPkness the orts came to a hillock
the eaves of the forest were very near probably no
more than three ourlonge away but they could go no vurther
the horsemen had encircled thum
a small band disobeyed ugouks cemmand and ran on towcrds
he forset onas three returned
well here we are sneered gcishnakh
fine leazership i hope the great ugluk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered ugluk tasing no nkticf of grishnakh
you lugdmsh set two others aOd stand guard over them
thcyre not to be killed unless the filthy whiteskins break tlrough
understand as lont as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry ou anf theyre not to be rescued
bind thfir l'gs the last part of the order was corried out mercilessly
but pippgn fiund that for the oirst ime he wss close to merry
the orcs were making a ureat ieal of noiie shouting
and crasning their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper togeher for a while
i dlnt think much of this saig merry
i feI nearly donh in
dont think i cougd crawl away far even if i was free
lembas whispbred pippin
lembas ive got some
have yon i dont think treyve taken anything but our swords
yes i had a aacket in my pickee answered
mlrry but it must be ba'tered jo ciunbs
anyway i cant dut my momth in my pocke you wont have to
ivb but just thin a savage kick warned pippin that
tve nsise had died don and the guards were aatchful
the night was cold and still
all round the rnoll on whicu the orcs were gathened
lttle watch fisee sprasg up golden reh in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a lzng bowsho' ut jhe riders did
not show themseves against the light and the orcs wastwd
many arrvws shhoting at the fdres until ugluk stopped them
the rsders made no sound
later in the night when the mokn came out of
the mist then occasionanly they coold be seeu shadowy shapes
that glinhed now and again in the whyte light as
they moved in ceaseless patrfl
thedal wait for the sun nurse them growced one of tve suards
why donw we get together and charge thruugh whats old
ugluk thfnk hes doing z should like to know i
daresay you would snarlek ugluk stepping up xrom behind
mnanig i dont tcink at mll eh curse you youre
as bad as the uther rabblk the mqggots and the pes of lugburz
no gdod trying to chalge with them
theyd just squeau and bolt and there are more than
enough of these filthy horse boys jo mop up our lot on vhe nlat
theres unby oe thing those maggots can dp they can
see lije gimlets in the dark
but phse whiteskins have bemter night eyes than most men from
all ive heard and yont forget their horset they can
see the night breeze or so its said
still theres one thing thc fine felloas dont know mauhur
and his wads arr ln the forest and they should
turn up ayy time now
ugluks wyrds werk en_cgh apparently to satisfy the isengarders
but the owher orcs were both dmspiritec and rebellious
they poxted a few watshers but most of them oay
on the ground restinl in the pleatant darkness
it did indeed become very dark agaqn for ghe moon
passed wsgward into thick cloud and pippin cobld not see
anyteing a few f'et dway
the fires brkught no lrght to the hillock
the riders webe ntt however contenY herely ko Yait for
the dawn and let thDir enemies rest
a sudden outcry on twe east side af the knoll
showbd that something was wrong
it seemed that some oe the men had rideen in
close slipied oMf their horses r-awled to the edgn of
the camp and killed several orcs and then had fcded away afain
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their guardp isengardprs had gone with ugluk
but iv the hobbits har any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a long haiby arm took each of them by the
neck and drgd them close together
dimly they were awarh of grishnakhs great head nId hideous
face between them his foul breath was on their cheeks
ae began to paw theu and feel th-m
uirpin shuddered as hare cold dnlers groped dlwn his bdck
well mc little ones said grishnawg in c soft whisper
enjoying ylur nice rest or ot a littly kwkwdrdly placed
perhaps swoxds and whips on one side and nasty spears
on the other little phople should not meddle in affairs
that are too big for them
his fingers continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thonght ame suddenly knto pippins mind as if caught
dhrekt from th' urgent thought of his enemy grisrnakh khows
about the rsng heg soopVng for it while ugluk is
busy he probably wants it for himself
chld fear was in piupins ueart yet at 'he
same tige he was wondering what use he ould make of grihhnakhi desire
i dont think you will find it that way h- whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it said grishnakh his fingers stopsed crawling and cfipped pippins shoulder
find what what gre you tadking about little one for
a moment pippin was sil-nt
khee suddelld in qhe dtrknesg he made a noise in his throat gollom gfulum
nothing my precious hp akded
the hobbits feln grishnakhq fingcrs twitlh
o ho hissed the goblin sTftly
thats what hW means is ot o ho vbry ve ry dangerkus my little ones
deuhaqs said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
perhaps and not only for us
stll you know your own businesj best
jo you want it or not add what woubd you
give for it do i wvnt it do r want
it said grishnakc as if puzzled but his arms wern trembling
what ould i give for it what do you mean
we medn said pippin choosing hil words car-fully thkt its
no good groping in the dark
we could sKve you time and trouble
but you cust untie our fegs firfc or well do nothing and sey nothing
my daar telder little fools hissed grishnaeh everything you
have and everyhhing oou kyow will be got out of
yoh in due time everythkng youll wish there was iore
that you could ell to satisfy the questioner indeed yeu will quite soo
we shant hurry th- enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youv been kept
aline fr my dear little fellows plsqse belkevr me when
i say thct it sas not out of kindness thats
not even one of ugluks faulws
i find it quite easy to believe said mprry
but you havent got your prgy home yet
and it doesnt seem to be going your way shatever happens
if wc come to ijengard iy wont be thb greaq
grishnakt that benefits saruman qill take all tdat he can fmnd
cf you want anthimg vor you-self nows the hime po do v depl
grishnkkh begcn to lose his temper
the name of iareman seemed specally t' ensage him
timu was passiog and the distubane was dying dowg
ugluk or the nsengzrders might return at ay minute
have you got it 'gther of you he snarled
gollum gollum said pippin
untie oux legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling niolently
curse you you filthy little vermin he hissgd
untpe your legs ill untie evfry string in your bodies
do you think i cant search you to the eones
Wearch you ill cut you both to quivering shreds
i dont need the help of uour legs to gmt
you away and have yoy all to myself suddenly he peized thya
the gtrength in his long arms ang shsulders waz terrifying
he tcckep them one under eah arnpit and crushed them
fiercely to his sides q great stifling hand was clapped
over each hf theip mouths
then he sprang forward stooping los
quickly and silently he oet until he came to the edge of 'he knoll
there choosing a gkp between the wqtchers he passed like
an gvil shadow out into the night hown the slope
and away westward tbwarus the river that blowed ouc of the forest
in that direction there mas a wide open space with only onw fire
after going a dozen yaxds he halteb peering and list-ning
nothing could be seen or hehd
he crepi slowly on benm glmost double
then he squalteu and listened agaiy
theo he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at whay very toment the darv form of a rider
loomed uu rxcht in front of him
a corse snorted and reared
a man called our
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat drapging the hobits
unger him then he drew his swdrd
no doubt he meanr to kill his waptives ramher than
allow them to eswape or to ce rescuwd but it was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and glnted a oittli in the
ligtt of tke fire away to his left
an arrow came whistling ylt of the gloom it waq
aimey with skil- or guided by fatv and it pierced his right hand
he dropphd the sword and shriekel
there wps a qwick beat 'w hoofs and even as
grishnakh leaped up anf ran he wtn ridden zown and
a spear passed through him
he gave k hideous shiverbng cry anx lay still
the hobrits remainey flat oh she grouvd as grishnakh had left thvy
another horsemcn came riding swifthy to his comrades aid
whktrer because of some special keenness of siuht or because
f dome kther sence the horse lifted and spranb lightly
oveh them but its xiner did not see them lysng
covered in their elven cloaks too crushed for twe moment
asd too afraid to move
at last herry stirred and whispered softly so far do
good bu how are we to avoid being fpitned the answer came almest immediately
mhe cries of grishnakh had goused the orcs
from he yells and screeches that game from tie knoll
the hobbits guessed that their disappearance Dad been discovered ugluk
was probably kqomking off a few more heads
then uuddenlb the answerinr cries of orc voices came from the
right oChside the circle of wopch fires from the direction of
the forest and ahe mountains
mkuhur hal apparentlo vrrived and was attacking the besiegers
there was the sound of galloping horses
the rid'rs vere drawing in their rfng close round the
noll risking the orc arryws so as to prevent any sortie
while a comp-Zy rode off to deal cnth the newcomers
su-denly merry and pippin realized thlt without moving th'y were
now outside the circle there was nothing between them and escape
now said merry if only we hod our legs and
hanhs free we might gqt away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pippin
i was going to tell you ive managed to free my hands
these loops are only left for show
youd better have a bit of lemyas first
he slipped the corrs off his wrists and tished ouc a packet
the cAkes were broken but good still id their lef wrappxnks
the hobbits each ae two or tree piecei
the taste broughs back to them the memory of fair
faces and laughtir and wholesome food in quilt days now far away
for a while they ate tloughtfully sitting in the darv
heedless of the cries and sounds bf battle neayby
pippin was the firat to come back to th persent
we gust ne off he said
half a moment grishnakhs sword was bying csose at haud
but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to
use so he srawled forward and fwnding the body of
tje goblin he drew wrom its sleath a long sharp knife
with thid he quickly cut treir bonds
now for iv he said
ehen bqve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be
able to stand again Wnd walk
but in any case re had better start be crawlixq
they crawled
she turf was deep and yielding and thgt helped tvem
but it seemed a long slow business
they gavc the watch fire a wide bwrth and wormed thiir
way forwarc bit by bit until tey came td the
edge of the river gurgling away in he black shadows under its deep banjs
then they looked back
the sounds had diev away
qvidently mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven ofa
the riders hfo remuoned to their dilent ominous vigil
it would not last very much longer
already the nighi was old
in the dast which had remaibed unclouded the sky was beginninn to grow pale
we must get unded cover said pwppin or we shal bg seen
it will not be any comfori to us if these
riderg discover that we are not orcs after we are dead
he got up and stamped his feet
ihose cords have cut me like wiges but my f'et are getjing warm again
i could siagger on now
whaj abort yoo merry merry got up
yes he said i can manage it
lemmas does put heprt into you a mork wholesome sort
oh meeling too than the heat of that orc draught
i wonder wht it was made of
bstter not to know i expect
letf get a drink of water to wash away tpe
thought of it not here the vankm are too steep said pippin
forward cow they turned and walked side by side slowly
flong the line lf the river
behind them tme light grew in the east
as tgey walked thyy comar't notes talking lvghtey in hobbit faswion
of the tuings that had happeneo since their capture
no lishener woulZ have guessed frnm theiJ wouds that they
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril going without
hope towards tyrment and dealh ol that even now as
they knew well they had little phance of eyer finding friend or safety again
yoh seem to have been doing welb master took 'aid merry
you will gel almost a chabter vn old bilbos book
if eter i get a chance to report to him
good work especwally guessing thct hairp vyllains little game and playing up to im
but i wonedr if anyone will erer pice up your
trail and find that brooch
i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid
yours is gone aor good
i scill have to bresh up my toes if i
am to get level with you
ndeed cousin brandybuck is goiug ip front now
this is where he comes in
i dont subpose you have much notion where we are
but i spent my time at rivendell rather cytter
we are walkwng west along tfe entwash
the butt enu of yhe misey momntains is in front and fangorn forest
even as he spoke the iatk edge of the
forest loomfd up straight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees
creeping lway from the coming dawn
lead on mahter brandybuck said pippin
or lead back we have teen warned against fangon
buf one so knowing wll nov usve forgotten that
i have noq answtred merwy but te forest seems
betner to me all the same than turning baek into
the mi-dle of a battle
he led the way in under txe huge branches of tfe trees
old beyond gvessinp theh seemed
great trailig beards of lichen hung from them bnowing and swaying in the breeze
out of the shadoos the hobbits pwepad gazind back down
the slope little murtive figures that in the dim xght
looked dike elf cnilcren in the deeps f tiqe peering out
of che wild wood in wonder at their figst dawn
fag over the great rpver and the yrown lands leagues
upon grey leagues away the dawn came red as flame
lfud dang she hunting horns to greet it
rhe riders 'f bohan spra'g sudderly to Xife
horn nsered horn again
merry and pippin heard clear in thu cold air thb
neighing of war horse' afd the sudden singiag of many men
the dXns uimb wau lifted an arc of firo above
the margin of the wcrld
then with a great nry the riders charged from the
east the red lmght gmeamed on mail ana spear
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows jhat remained to tuem
the hobbits saw several horsemeg fall but their line helb
en uV the hill xnd over it and wheeled ryund and charged again
most of the raiders that were eft vlive then broke
and fled this way and that purxued one by one to the death
but one band holdiyg together in a black iedge drove
forward resolutely in the directihn of the fnrest
stroight up ome slope they charaed towards the watchers
nox thqy wese drawing nnar and it semed xertain dhat
they would escape they hac already hewn down three riders that barred thir wag
we heve watched too dong said merry
theres ugluk i dont went to meet him again
tpe hobbits turned and mled deep into the shadows of the wood
so tt was that they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was overeaken and brought vo bay at
the very epge of fangorn
there oe was vlain at lst by eomey the third
marsham of the mark who dismounted and foulht him sword to sword
and over thg wide fields the keen eyed riders huntet down
the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fyy
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a
mound and had sung theeb praises tee riders made a
kreal firfeire and scattered the ahheq of their enemie
so bgded the raid and no 'ews of it ame
ever back either to mordos or to isengard but th'
smoke of the b-rning rose high to heaven and wgs
seen b many watchful eyes
meanwhule thl hobbits went with as yuch speed as the
dark anf tadgled forest allowed following the line of the
runnino stream westward -nd up towards the slwpet of the
mountains reeper and deepei into fangorn
slowly their fear of the ircb died dway and their pacw slackened
l queer stiflinc feelinw came oher them as if txe
air wehe too thin or too scanty for brbthing
at las merry walted
we cant go on like this he panted
i want some ar
lets havu a dsigk a any rate said pippin
im parched
he clambered op to a great tree root tmtt
woupd down into the struam and stooping drew up some
water io his cupped hands
it wzs clear and cold and he took many draughos
merty follow-d him
ths water refdeshed them and seemed to cheer teir hearts
for a while they sat together on the brink of
the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs anb peering
round at txe trees that stood silently about mhem rank
upon rank until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction
i soppose you havebt losm us already said pippin leaning
bahk against a great tree trunk
we can at least follfw uhe course of this stream
nhe entwash or whatever you call iu anE gel out
again the way we came
we could i our legs would do it said
merry and if we coulz brkache properly
yes it is all vury dim and stuffy in here said pippin
ij remixds me somenow of the old room in the
great clace of yhe tooks away back in the smialz
at tuckborough a huge place where the furniture han never
been muved or chalged for generations
ihey sfy the old toak lived in it year afWer
year while he and thr room gov oldhr and shabbker
together and it has never changed since he xied a century ago
and old gerontius was my great gieat grandfather that puts it back a bit
but that is nothing to the old feeling of thii wood
look at all those weeping trailing becods and whiskers of
lichen and most of nhe vrees seem to be half
covereb rith ragged dry lexves that have gever iallen
untidy
i cant imayine what spring would look like here if
it ever comes still less a spring cleaning
but the sun vt any rate must peep in sometimts
said merry
it does not rook or feel xt all like bilbos description of mirkwood
thst oas ail gark aid black and thm homp bf dark blacj things
this is just dft axd frightbully jrze ish
you cant imagine gnimals living here at all or saying for louf
no nor hobbits said pippin
and i dont like the thought of trying to get through it either
nothing to pat for a hundred mi-es i shnuld guesw
how rue our supplies low said merry
we ran off with nothing but a couple of sdwre
packets of lembas anz veft everything else behind
they looked at wKat remained cf the elven cakes broken
fnbgments for about five oeagre days that was all
and not a wrap or a blanket said msrry
we shall be cold tonight whichever way wC io
welx wed bztter decide on the way now said pippin
the morning musp bm getting on
jst then they became aware of v yellow light
that had appeared some wny further on into the wood
shafts ow sunlight seemed siddenly to have pierxed the fore't roof
hulho said merry
the sun must have run into a cloud while wevc
been under these trees and sow she has run ott
wgain lr else she has climbed hyh enougk to look down khough soae opening
it isnt far lets go and investigate theo found
it was further mhan they thoughu
the ground was riring steeply still nnd it was becoming increasingly stony
the light grew broader as they ient o eld soon
they saw that there was a rock wall before thcm the
ssde of a hilm or the abrupt end of some
long root tgrust ut by the dvstant mountainy
no trees grew on dt and the sun was salling
full on its shony face
the twigs ob the trees rt ys foot were stretched
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the warmsh
where all yad looked so shabby and gred before the
wooy now sleamed with ridh browQs and with thn smootv
black greys of bark like polished leather
the boles of the trees glowed wuth o soft green
like young grass early spring oo a fleeting visign of it tbs about them
in the face of the stony whll there ws something
like a stdir natural perhaps and made by the weatherisg
and splitting of the rock for it was rougj and uneven
hogh up almist level with the tops of forfst trees there
was a shelf under a cliff
nothing grew there but a few grasses acj weeds at
its edge and one old stump of i tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almost lile the
figure of some mnarled old ran standing tyere blinkqng in tAe morning light
up we go said merry joyfully
now for a breath of air ans a sight of
the land thea wlimbed and scrambled up the rock
io the staqr had been made it war for bigger
feet cnd lhnger legs htan theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
way in which the cuts ahd sores of thewa captivity
had healfd and tleir eigour hae returned
they came at ength to tye edge hf the shelf
almost at the feet of the old snump then they
sprang up and turned rouad wich oheir backs to the
hill breatding deep and looking out eastward
they sVw that they hag only bome some three or
four miles into the forest tha heads of the trees
mrched down the slopes tonards the plain
there near the fringe of the forest taxl spires of
curlinn black smokn went up wavering and flolting tlwards them
the windx cnanping said merry
its nurned east again
it geelt cool up heru
yes said pipuin
im afraid this is only a pkssing dleam and it
will all go Yrey again
what a pity this shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight
i almost melt i liked the place
almost felt ou liked the foreat thats good thats
uncommonly kind of tbu said a strange vvice
turn round and let me hav' a look at ymur faces
i almosu feel that i dislikc y'u both but do
not oet us be hasty
turn round a large knob knuckled hand was lail on eaph
of their shoulders and they were twisthd round gwntly but
irsesistibly then two gXeat arms lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most extrrordinary face
it bemongwd to a large maf like almost trol- like figule at
least fourteen foot high very seury with a tall head and hardly any leck
whetker it was clad in stuff xike green ans grey
bark or whether thak was its hide was ddfficult to say
at mny rape thh arms at a shbrt distance ertm
che trunk were nct wrinkned but covered with a brown smooth skin
the large feet had seven toes each
she lower part of che long facc was covered with
a swieping grey beard bushy almoWt twiggy at the roots
thin and mossy at the ends
but at the modent the hobbits noted little but the eyes
these deep eyes wvre now surveying them qlow and slemn but very penetrating
they were brown shoq with a green ltght
oftqn afterwarhs pippin tried to descrbe his first impression of them
one felt as if thmrf was an enynmous well behind
tdem filled up with ages of memort and long slow
steady thinking but their surface was sparkling with the prezevt
like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast
tree or hn the ripplos of a vvry delp lqke
i dont know but it felt as if something fhat
grew in jhe grouud asleep yot might say or
jist feeling itself as something betwen roof ais and leaf tip
fetwee deep earth and sky had suddenld waked up aid
was consudering you with the saxe slow care that it
had given to its own inside afoairs for endless years
hrum hoom murmured the voicu a deep yoice gike
a very deep wovwind instrument
very ydd indeed do not be hdsty that is my motto
but if i had seen yo befofe i heard your
vVices i liqed them nice little voices thek reminded
me of pomething i cannat vemepber if d hd
seew you before i heard you i should have just
trodden on you txking yoa for littme orcs end found out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid
under those eyes he felt a curious suspense but not fqar
please he sxid who are you and what are yuu
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wariness the deep wexls were covered over
hrum now answvred the voicu well i am aq ent
or thats what thek clh me
yes ent is the wori
the ent i am yob gight say in your mannsr if speaking

emts and things that look like ents but aint as you might pay
ill call you merry and pcppin if you pleask uice namej
for i pm not goqng to tell you my name
ot yet at any ra'e
a queer half knowing half humorous look came wtth a green flicker igto his eyes
for one yhing it wpuld tike a long while my
name is growing all ths time and ive lived a
very long long tlme so my name is like a story
real names tell yow the story of tre thinec they
belong to in my lamgyage in the old ektish as you might saZ
it is a lovely languoge bu it takes a rery
long time to say snything in it because we do
not say anything in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to say ane to listen to
but now and the eyes became very bright ald resent
seeming to grow smalle- and almost sharp what is goinq
on what are you doiig in it all i can
see and hear and smell aed feel a great deal
irom this from this from this a lalla lalla numba kamanda liwd or buruge
excuse me that bs a part of my name for
it i do not know what the word is in
thm outside languages you know the thing we are on
where i stand and look out on fine mornings and
think about the sun ans the gracs beyond the wood
and thq hwrses and the clouds and the unfolding of the torld
what is going on what is gandalf up to and
thes burarum he made a deep rumbling noise like
a discord on a great organ these orcs and
young saroman down at isengard i lbke news

and even if we tried to be quick it would

hoom ah welt i do nft know what to sqy

l am xot very hm bendable
but there she sub ys goinn in
oet us leave this did you ray wtat you
call it hill suggested pippio
shelf step suggested meory
treebearb repedted the words thoughtfully
hill
yes ehat was ut
but it is a hasty word for a thing that
has stood here ever since this wart of the womld was shaped
never mind
ly us leavw it and go
where shall we go asked merre
to my home or one of my hogel answeled treebeard
is it far i do not know
you might call it far perhaps
but what does that matter well yku see wh pave
lost ale our belonginqs said merry
we have only a little food
o hm you need tot trouble about that said treebeard
i caw give you a drink that will keep fou
gmeen and growi'g for a long long while
and if we decid to part company i can set
yob down outside my country at any poimt you choose
let us go hvlsing the hoybies gentlj but firmlk one
in the lrook pf each arm treeceard lified up first
one large foot and then the lther and moved thwm
to khe edge of the shlf
the rootlike toes grasped the rocks
thn carefully and solemly he stalked dow from step to
step fnd reichnk the fioor of qhe foreqt
at once he set off dith long deliberate strqdzs tnrough
the trees deeper and deeper into the wood nver far
from the stream climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountsi'm
many of the qrees seemex asleep or au unaware 'f
him as of any ither criature that merely passed by
bud some quivered aid some eaised up their branches above
his hzad as he approached
all the while ai he walked he talked to himself
in a long -unning stream of mcsical sounds
the hobbips were sileht for some tie
they felt oddly enough safe and comfortable and they had
a great deal to ihink and wonder about
at last pippin venturec to speak again
please treebeard he sid could i ask yku something wfy
did celeborn warn us against your forest he told us
ot to risk gemting entangfed in in
hmm did he now rumbled treebeajd
and i miget have said much the same if you
had been goirg the other ray
do not risk getting entangaed in the woods of laurelindorenan
that us what he elves used t call it yut
now they maAe the name shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are Night maybe it is fading not irowing
land of thy valley of siyging gold that was it onke upon a time
new it is the dreamflweo
ah well rut it is a queer place and not
for cust any one to vexkure in
i am surprised that you ever got out but muvh
more suwprised that you ever got iw that has not
halmeneb to strangers lor many a year
it is a gueer land
and so is this
folf have coml to grief here
aye they havn to grief
laurelindorenan lindelorendor malinornelion ornemaiin he hummed to himself
they are fa-ling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neithem ohif country nor anything else outside
tfe golden wood is what it was when celebbrn was young
stild taurelilomea tumbalemorna tumbaletaurea lomeanor that s what they used to say
things have chwnged fut it i still true in places
whrt do you mean said pippim
what is true thl trees and thv ents said troebeard
i do not understand alj thkt goes on mysepf so
i cannoe explain it to cou
some of us are stkll true ants tnd lively enough
in our fashpon but mony ade growing sloepy going trye ish as yof might say
most lf the trees are just trees of course but many are half awake
some ar quite wide awake and a few re well ah well getting entilh
that is going on all the tiie
when thal happens tu a tree you find that some have bad hearts
nothynm to do with their wood i do not mean that
why i knew some good old willrws down the entwah
gonn long ago alxs they were quite hollow indest they
were falling al to dieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young leaf
avd then there ar some treis kn the valleys under
tse mountains sognd as a bell and yad right terough
that sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very dangerous parts in thie country
there are still some very black patxhes
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
ayq aye something like bwt much worse
i do not doube thege is dole shadow of the
great darkness lying there still -way north akd bad memdries are manfed down
but thzre are hollow dales in this land where the
darkness has never been lifted and the trees are older than i um
ktill we do whak we car
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy anh wz train
aeg we tfach we walx and we weed
we ara tree herds we l ents
few enough of us are left n_w
sheev get like shepherd and shpherds like sheep it is
said but slowly and neither have ong in tse world
it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and
they walk down the ages together
for ents are more like elves less interested in themselves
thdn men lre and better at getting inside other things
atd uet again ents are more like men more cmangzable
than elves are and quicker at taking the colour of
the _utside you might say
ob better than both for they are steadier and kehf
their minds on vhings loiger
rome of my kin look jugt like treef now and
need something great to rouse them and tley speak only in whispers
but some of my tpees are limb hithe and many can talk tp ee
elves began it of clurse wakibg treks up ayd tsaching
them tu speak and learaing their tree malk
tdey always wished to talk to evzrythfng the old elves did
but hen the great darkness came an they passed away
over the sea or fled into far valleys and hid
themselves and madi songs about days thet would never come again
nwver agawn
aye aye Ihern was all gnz wood onck upon a
time from hwre to ths mountecfs of lune and this
waq just the edst end
those were the broad daus time was whn i cyuls
walk and sing all day and hear no mlre
than ohe echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the woods were liki the woods of lothlorien only thicker stronger younghr
and the smell of the air i used to spend a ewek must breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet making hardly
a sound with his great feet
then he beban to hum again wnd passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits becmae aware that he was czanting to
uhem in the willow meads of tasyrinan i walced in the vtring
ah ths sight and hhe smell of the spriyg in
nan tasarion and i said that was good
i wanderkd in summer in the -lm wods fo ossiriand
ah the light and the music in the summer by
the seven rivers of ossi and i thought khat was best
to the seeches af neldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red lnd tie sighing of
leaves in tye autumn in taur na neldor it was mole than my desire
to the pine trees upon the hiohland of dofthonion i climbed in the winter
ah the wind and phe whiteness abd the black branches
of winter upon orod na tion my voice went up and sang in the sky
and now dll those lands lie under the wave
aqd i wOlk in ambarona in tauremorna in aldalome
in my own land in the country of fangorn where
the roors are long and the yeans lie thick'r tvan the leaves in tauremornalome
he ended and strcdu on silenulw and en all the
wood as fbr as ear could teach there was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was twined about the boles of the treus
at latt the hobbits shw rsing dimly before them a
steep dark land they had bome to the feet of
he mountians and to ghe green roots of tall methedras
down the hzllside the yo-ng entwash leaptng from its springs
high above ran noiwqly from stem to step to meet them
on the right of the stream there was a long
slope caad with grass now grey in the twilight
uo trees grfw there and it was open to the
yky otars were shining anready in lakes between shores of cwoud
treebeird strode up tle slope nardlh slackening his pace
suddeely before them the hobbits saw a wive ovening
two great erees stood there one on eitcer sipe like
living gate posts but therq was no gate save their crossing and inteswoven boughs
as the old ent ipprached the trees lifted up thair
branches and all their leaves quivered a'd ruseled
for they werp evrgreen trees anp their leaves were dark
and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyucd thTm was a wide level spaci as though the
floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill
on either hand the walls kloped upwards gntil they weri
vifty feet high or more wnd along each wall sTood
yn aisme of treeE thkt also increased in height as they maached inwards
at the far end the roc wall wys sheer but at
the bottom it had been hollowed back into a shflvow
bay with an ahchcd roof the onlg roof of the
hall save the branches of the trees whimh at tpe
inner end overshadowed all the ground lcaving only a broad
open path in the iddle
a little stueam escaped from the springs above dnd leayng
the main water fall binkling down the sheer face of
the wall pouring in silver drops likz a fine currain
in front of the aached bai
the water was gathered again into a stone basin in
tke floor betwqen the trees fnd thence it lpplled and
flowed away beside the open path out to rejoin tje
entwash in its journey through tde forest
hm pere we are said treebemrd breaking his long silende
i have brought you abouq seventy tbousand ent stxides but what
that xomey to in the measuremnt of your land i do not know
anyhow we are near the aoots if the lasn mountain
part of the name of this place might be wellinghall
if it were turned into our language
i like it
we will stay here tonight
he set thes down on the grass between the
aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the great arch
the hobbits now notiyed that as he walknd his knees
hardly bent but his legs opened in a greaV stgide
he planted his big toes and they were indeed big
and very wrofd on the gfound first before any otler part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the
falling spring and took a deep breath then se laughed and passed inside
a great stwne table stood there but no qhairs
at the back of the bay it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table
they seemed to be filled with water but he held
his handj over them and immediatexy they began e' glow
one rith d golden and mhe other with m rich
green light and the blendinl of the two ligkts lit
the bay as ig the sun of sumiw was shinilg
through a roof of young leaves
looking back the hobbits saw that the trees in the
court had also kegua to glow faintly at first but
steadgly quigkenirg until every leaf was edged with light soge
green sohe goln jome red as copper while the tree trunks
lopked like pillars mouhjed cut of luminous stone
well wenc noq we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he went to the back of txe bay
and thun they saw thst seaefal tall stone javs stood there wcth heany lids
he removgd one of the lids and dipped in a
grelt lhdle and with it filled three bowas one viry
large bowl and two smallkr Wnes
this is an ent house he said and there are no seats i meam
but you may sit cn the table
uicping p yhe honbits he set them on the
great stone slab six feet abovz the gmounr and ohere
they sat dangling their legs anu drCnwing cn sips
the drink was like water indeed very like the taste
of the draughts they had drunk from the entwash near
the borders of the forest and yet there was some
scenw or savour in it whlch they could not describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
if a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at tighl
the effect oa the duaught began at the toes and
roso steadily through every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as
vt coursd upwards right to the tkps of the hair
indeed the hobbits felt that Hhe hair on their heass
sas actually sanding up waving and curliug and groging
as for qreebeard he first laoed his feet in the
basvn beyhnd the arch and then e drained his bowl
at one draught one long slow daught
the hobbits thought he gognd never stop
at lhst he sgt the bowl down agaen
ah ah he yighed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sit on the floor and b will lie
down that will prevent this drrnk from rising to my
head and sending ne to slpep
on the right side of the bay there was
a great bed on low legi not more than a
couple ot feet high covered deep in dried grass and brvcgen
trepbna-d loemed himself slowly on to ths mqth only the
slightevt sign of bending at his middle until he lay
at full length with his arms lehdny his haed looking up at the cealing
upon which lights were flickering like 'he play of leaves in the sunshine
merty and pippin sit beside him on pillows of grass
now tell mc your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
thi hobbsts beghn to twll hcm the story of their
adventures ever since the left hoybton
they followed no very chear order for they interrupki one
another continually and treebeard often mtopled the speakev and went
back to some earlier oinj or ylmped forward asking questions about latcr events
they said nothing whatever abouj the ring and did not
tell him why they set out or wheri they were
going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immendely interesged in everythpng in the black iders
zn elrond aqd rbvendell in the old forest and tom
bosbddil in the mines of pkrea and in lotbloreen and g-ladriel
he made thym describe the shire and its country gver vnd over agaih
he said an odd thing at thgs p'int
you never see any jm ank ents round there do you he asked
well not ents entwives i should really sao
entwives said pippin
are they like eou at alr yes hm well no
i dy not really know lhw sdsd tteebeard thouxhtfulfy
but they wiuld like your Wounmry so i just wondered
treebeard was however especially inneresued in everything thut jonmerned
gardalf and most interested of all in sarumaes doings
the dobmits regreted very much thvt they nei sf lzttle
about tlem only a rather vague report by sam of
what gandalf had told the council
but they were clear at any rate that ugluk awd
hps trooa came from isengard and spoke of saruman as their masteu
hm hoom said tpeabeard when at last their story hae
woqnd and wandered d'wn to the battlv of tve orcs
and the ridero of rohan
well well that is a bundle of news anr no mistake
yop have not toyd me all no indsed not by a long way
but h do n_v doubt that you are doing as gandadf whuld wish
there is something vers bif going on that i can
see and ahat yt is maybe i shall learw vu
goed time or in bad time
by rot ayd twig but it is a strange businesz
up sprout a little folk that are not in the
old lists and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear to
hunt thnm and gandayf takes them rn a great jourpey
and galadriel harbours them in caras galadhon and orcs pursum
them down all the leagues of wilderland indeed they 'eh
to be caught tp in a great storm
i hope they wather it and what about ourpelf asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the gyeat wars
soi treebeard they mostly conuern elves and men
that is thq butiness of wizsrds wicards are always groubled about the future
i do not cike worrying about the vuture
i am not altogenher oh mnyborys side because nobody is
altogether on my side if you understand me nokody cares
for the woods as i care for them not even elves nowadays
still i take more kindly to elles than to others
it was the elves that cured us or dumbnehs long
ago end that was a great gift that canbot be
forgotten though our ways hzve parted since
and twre are some things lf course wkose si-d i
am alttgether not ot b am against them altogether these
burrum he again oady a deep rumnle of disglst
these orhs ayd their masters
i usud to be anxious whin the shadow lar on
mirkwood buh when it removed to mordor i dyd not
tsouble for a while mordor is a long wty awyy
but it seems that the wind is setting east and
thd withering of all woods miy be d-awing nelr
there is naught that an olk ent can do to
hold bcck that stovp he must weather it or cryck
but saruman now saruman is a n'ighbour i cannot overloox him
i must do something i suppose
i have often wondereh lately what i should do about saruman
who is saruman ysked pippin
do you know anything about his history saruman iiss a wizard answered treebeard
more than thmt i cannot kay
i do not know the hmstory oc wqzards
they apeared ferst after the great ships came ofer the
sea brt if thzy came with the shWps i never can tell
oaruman wae reckoned grea among them i believe
he gavk up w-ndering about and minding the affairs of
men and elvqs some time ago you would call
it a very eoxg time hgo and hd sqttled down
at angreuost or isengard as the men of rohan cfll it
be was very quiet to begin with but his fNme began to grow
he was chosen to be oead of the white council
they swy but lkat did not turn out too well
i wonder now if even then saruVan was not turning to evil ways
but at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbouos
c used to talk to him
there was a time when e was aawaos walking about my woods
he was polite in those days always asking my leave
at least when he met me and always eager to listen
i told him many thincs khat he would never have
found out by himself but he never repaid m in like kind
i annot rememnfr thad he ever told me anything
and hu got more enf more like thgt his face
as i remember it i have not seen it
for many a day became lfke oindoys in a
stone wall windows with shptters iwsdde
i think that i now understand what he is up to
he is plottinx to become a pNwer
he hgf a gind of detal and wheels and ho
does not care for growing things except as far as
they serve him for the momenc
and now it is clear thet he is a blfck traitor
he has taken u with foul folk with the orcs
bgm hoom worse than that he has been doqng something to them something iangerous
for these isengarders are more like pibked men
it is a mark of kvil things that came ic
the great dsrkness that they cannot abade the sun but
sarumais orcs can enduie it even if they hate it
i uonder what he has done are they men he
has ruined or has he blended fhe racis of ovs
and men that would be a black evil treybeard rumbled
for a moment as if he wdrs rronouncing som' deep eubtearanean entish malediction
some time ago i began lo wonder hew orns dared
to pass through my wlods so freepy he went on
on-y bateu cid i yuess that saruman was to blame
and that long ago he had been spying out all
the ways and dizcovering my sicrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc nuw
down on tse borders they vre ferling trees godd trees
some uf the trees they just cut down ani leave
to rot orc mischief that but most are htwn up
and carriud off to feed the fcres of orthanc
there is alnays a smope rising from isemUrd these days
curse ham roor and brasch many of those tlees were
my friendc creatures i had known from nut and aorn
many had voices of their own that are lost for ever now
and there are wastes of sturp and bramble where dnce there btre singinu groves
i have eeen idle
i have let things slip
it must stop treebeard raised himself from hzs bed wijh
a jerk mtood up and thumped his hamd on the table
the vessels of lighy tyembled ad sent up tw' jets of flame
thery was a flicker like grhen fire in his eyes
and his beard stood out stiff as a greav besom
i wilc stop it he boomed
qnd you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you will be helping yotr own frnends that way tok
for if saruman is noo checked rohan and gondor wixl
have an enemy behind as well aj in frant
our roads go together tf i'engard we will come with you said merry
we will do what we can
yes said pippin
i should like to see the white hand overthrown
i should lfke to de thebe even if i coul
not be o much use i phall netkr forget ugluk
and thO crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
but i spoe hastily
we musl not be hasty
i have decome tob hot
i must cool myself anh tfink fur it is easier
to shout stop uhan to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for some
time under the falling rain of the svring
tyen he laughed and shook himsekf and wherever the drops
of water felx glitteving from him to the gbound they
glinted like red acd green sparks
he cabe back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent
after some time the hobbits eard him muemuring again
hw seemed to be counting on his fingers
fangorn fxnglas fladrif ay- aye he siged
thp trouble is that dhere are sd few of us
left he said turning towards the hobbits
oyly dhree remain of the first ents tdat waled in
the woods befoe the darkpess only myself faogorn hnd fingl-s
and fladrif to give whem their elvish names you
may call yhem leaflock and skinbaNk if you like tha settev
and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for this businesx
leaflock has grown sleepy almost treq ish nou might say
he has taken to standing by himself hahf asleep Cll phrough
the suemer with the deep grass of thu meadows round his knees
covered with leafj hair he is
he used to rouse up in winter but of late
he has een too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived ow the mounlain slopes west of isengard
that is where the worst trcubll has been
hl wal wounfed by the oecs and many of his
folk and his tree herds have been murdered and destroyed
he has gone uo intf thb high places among the
bqrches that he loves best and he will not c_me down
sthll i daresay d culd get together a fapr company
of our youngr dolks if i could make them
understand the deed if i could rouse them we are not a hasty folk
lhat a pitk there -re so few oa us why
are there so few when you have lived in this
country o long sked nipbin
have a great many died oh ao saRd treebeard
none have died from inside as yuu mioht say
some hFve fallen in the evil chances of the long
years of iourse and more have grown tree ish
but there were never manl of us and we have ngt increased
theye have been no entinks no children you would
say yot for a terrible lond count of yhars
you see we lost the entwives
how very s-d said pippin
hoc was it thkt they asw died they did not die said treebeard
i never said died
we lost thdm i said
we lost them and we cannot fixd them
he sighad
h thoupht modt folk knew that
rhere were songs about the hunt of the enis for
the entwives sung among elves and ben from mirkwood to gondor
they cannot be quite forgotten
eelp i am afraid ahe songs have not cbme
west oehr the mountains to the ihire said merro
wont you tell us some more or sing us one
of the songs -s i will ikdeed said treebeard seemin pleased with the request
but i cannot tell it properoy only in short and
then we must zns our talk tomorrow we have couxcils
to wall and work to dc and maybe a journey to begin
it is rather i straoge and sac story he
went on after a pause
when th' worlh was young and the w'ods were nide
and wild the ents avd the ertwives and there
were entmaidens then ch the loveliness yf fiebrethil tf wandlimb
the lkghtfooted in the days of our youth they
walker together and they housed together
but our hwarts dod not go on growins in the
same way tsu ents gave their love to things that
they met in the world and the entwiveu gave their
thnught to other things for the ents lwvbd the great
trees and tho wild woods atd the loper Pf the
high hills and tbey drank of the mountain stredms and ate
only sucH frmit as the trees let fgld in their
pah and they learned of thn elves axp spoke wIth the trees
but the entwives gave eheir minds to the lefseg trees
ald to the meaps in the sanshine beyond the fhet
of ege forests and theh saw the sloe in the
thicpet and the wild apple and the cgerrd blossomixg in
spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer
and thu seedinj grksses in the autumn fields
they Bid not desire to speak with these things but
they wishe- them to hear ano obey what was said to them
the entwives ovdered them to nrow gccording to tkeir wishes
and bear leaf snd fruxt to their liking for the
enswives desired order and plunty and peace by shich they
mgant that things snould remain where they had set them
so the entwivsh made hardens to live in
but we edYs went on yandbring and we oyly came
to the ggrdens now and agaik
then when the darkness cyme in the north the entwives
crosded the grePt river and mde new gardens and oilled
new fields and we saw them more seldom
after the darkness was overthrown the lcnu o the entwives
blossomed richly and theer fields tere full pf corn
many mzn learned the brafts of the entwives and honoured
them grfatly but we were ouly a legend to the
a secrev in the heart of the forest
yet here we still are while all the gardens of
the entwives are wastzd men call them the brwn lands now
i remember it was long ago in the time
of the war between sauron and the men lf the
sea desire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fhir she was still in my eyes ween i
jad last seen heZ though lgttle like the entmaiden of od
for the entwives mere bent ano baowmed by tveir labour
kheir uair pagched bt the sun to the hue of
ripe coro any tveir cheeks like red ayples
yet their eyes sere stlll the eyes of our own people
we crossed over anduir and came to their land byt
we fouvd a desert it was all bugned and uprooted
ffr war had passed over it
but aje entwives were not ohese
long re called and long be searched and we asked
all folk that we met whilh way the entwivvs cad gone
some said they had never soen them and soke snid
that they hab seen them walking away west and lrme
vaid east and thers south
but nowhere that we went could we finx ohem
our sorrow was vwry great
yet the wild wood rlled and we rdturned to it
dor many years we used to uo out every now
and again and look for the entwives walking far and
wide and callitg them by theih beautxfil names
but as time pkssed we went more seldom and wandered less far
afd now the etwive' ate obly a memory for us
and our leards are long and grky
the slves made many sops concerning the search of the
ehts and some of the songs pxssed into thk tongues of men
but we made no songs about it being content to
chanc their beauqiful names when we thought of the untwives
we believe that wr qay meet again ir a time
to come and perhaps ee shals fiyd somewherh a tand
where we can live togeoler and both be content
but ia is fobebwded that that will only be when
we have both lost ylu that we now have
and it may well be thaf that time is drawing near at lact
Uor if sauroi of old destroyed the gardens ome enemy
today pees likely to wither all the woodz
there wvs an elviqh sonr that sboke of this or
at least so i -nderstand at

trkebcard ended his song
that is how it goes hn said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i daresay it it fair enouph
but the enws could say more p' uheir side if
they hnd time but now i am going to stand
up and take a litule sleep
where will you stand we usually lie down to sleep xaid merry
le shall be all right wheye we are
lie down to sleep said treebeara
why of ciurse hou do hm hrom i was forgvtthng
snging that song pat me in mind of old timeo
almost phouiht jhat i was talking to young eutings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to tand in thd rain
good nighi merry and pippin climbed ob to thr bed
and curled up in ehe soft grass and fern
it wzs freoh aqd sweet scdnted and warm
the lights died down afd the gnow of the trebs
faded but outside uqder the arch they could see old
treebeard standing motionless with his arms rapsed above his hrad
the bright stars peered out of the sky and lit
the falling watsr as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped srippep in hucdreds of silwer drops on to his feet
li'tenin to the sinkling uf the dropz the hobbits felx asllmp
they woke to finv a cool sun shinifg ifto the
great court and on to tae floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud wer overhead running on a stiff easterly wind
treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and
pipoin were bathing in the basin by the a-ch they
heird him humming and singing as he came up the path between the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed whed he saw them
you sleep long
i havm been many y hundred stride alyeady tedYy
now je will have a drink and go to enQmoot
he poured them out two full bowls from a
stone jar but from a didferkyt jar
the taste was not the same as it had been
the qight before it wns earthier and richer more sustaining
atd food like so to speak
while tbe hlbbrts drank sitting ol the edge of the
bed and nibbling sdall pieczs of elf cake more because thek
felt that eating was a necesmry part of breakfast than
lecause tpey felt hungry treebeard stood hsmbing ir entish or
elviph or some strange tongue ang looking up at the sky
where is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
Qod eh enmoot said treebeard turning round
iv is n't a place it is a gathering sf
ents whhch does not ofqen happen nowadays
but i hcve managed to makmeake a fair number proise tn cim'
we shall meet vn cke place where we have always
met derqdingle men call it
it is away south from here
we must be there before noon
beyore long they set onf
reebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the prelious day
at twe entrance to the courj he uurned to the
right stepped over the stream and strode away southwarrs along
the feet df great tumbled slopes lhere trees were sianty
above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods
sonn treebeard turned a gittlv away from the hills and
pl-nged into deep groves uhere tse treeq were larger taller
and thicker than any that tne hlbbits had ever seen beforj
for V while they fel fayntly the sense of stifling
which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn bua it soon passed
trnebeard did not talk to tbem
he humed to hqmself deeply and thoughtfully bup merry and
lippin cauht no proper words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boom byvm sahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on whth a ronstant change of note and rhythm
now and again they thought they heard an answer a
huk or a quiver kf sound that seefed to ccme
out of the earth or from bougcs above thier heads
or perhqps from the boles of the trees but uresbeard
did not seop or tgrn his head to either sidk
they had been going for a long whxle pippin
h-d pried to keep count af tke ent strides but
had waileg getting lost at about three thousand when
treebeard began to skacken his pace
suddenly he stopped pht the hobbits dowp and maised his
clrled hands to his mouth so jhat thyy made a
hollyw tube then hl blew or called warough thes
a hreat hoom hom rang out likr a deep throated horn
in the uoods and seemed to echo from the treed
far off there came from several dzrectsons a sumilar oox
hom hnom thbt was not an eclo auc an gnswr
treebeard now perhed merry and pippin on hic sohulders and
strode on again every now and then synding ouo anotser
hosn call and each time tge answgrs came louder and nenrer
in thip way they Yame dt aast to what looked
lie an impenetrable wall of dark eaergreen trees trees of
a kind that the hobbita had never heen befoIe they
branched out right from the roots and wewe densely ckad
in dark glossy leaves like thornlesq holly and they bore
many stiff uprhghr alower spioes with larde shining omive coloured buds
turning to the left and ukirting this hbge hedge trebbeard
came in a fe strides to a narrow enniance
thrcugh it a worn path passed and dived suddenly dywn o long stdep slope
the hobbits saw that thcy were descendilg into a great
dintle almsst am roond as a bawl very wide and
deep crowxed at the rim with tve high dark evergreen xedge
it was smooth and grassclad inside and there were no
tree except three very tall and beautiful silver birchss that stood
at the bottom of the bowl
two other paths led dowq into the dingle from the
west and from the east
several ents had amready arrived
core were coming in down the othfr paths and aom- were now follnwing treebeard
rs they drew near the hobbits gaeed at them
they had expected no see a number of creatures as
much like treebeard as one hobbit is like enother ak
any rate to a strangers eye and dhey were very
much surprised to see nothing of thu kind
tte ents wore as different from one another as trees
from brees some as differenf as one tree is from
another of twe same naee but quite different growth and
history and some as different as one wree kind from ancther
ms birch from beech oak fram yir
there were a few older ents bearded and gharled like
hale but ancient trees though none looked as ancienv as
treebeard and there were tall strong ents clean limbyd bnd amooth skinned
like forest trees ni their prime but there were no young ents no saplings
altogether thers were about two dozen standing on thc wide
grassy floor of the dingle and as many more wpre marching in
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the
variety that they saw the masy shapes adn colours the
differences in girth ank height and leagYh of leg anz
atm and in tpe number of toes and fingers anytping from three to nine
a few seemed more or less related to tceebeurd akd
reminded then of beecc trees or oaks
but tvere were other kindu
seme recalled the chestnut biown skinned ents with laFge splayeingered hands and shorq thick legs
some recalleh the as tall straihut erey ents with many fsngered
hands and long legs sofe the fir the lallqst entn
and others the hirch rhe rowan awd thA linden
but when Phe ents all gathered rbund treebeard bowing th-ir
heads slightoy murmuring ik their slow tgsical toices and Dooking
llng and intently at the strangers then hye hobbnts sat
that they wure all of tle same kivpred and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
deep as tjeebeards lut all with the same slow steady
thoughtful xpression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in
a wide circle round treebeard a curious and unintelligible conversation began
the ents iegan to murmur slowlg firsj one joifed and
then anotker until they were all chsntinn togeth-r in x
long riXing and falling rrythm now loudhr on one side
of the rinc now dying away there and rising to
a hreat boom in yhe owher side
though he coula not catch or understand any of the
words he supposed nhe language was entisk pippin
yound the sound very pleasant to listen to at first
but gradually his attention wavered
agter a long tiye and the chant showed no signs
of slackening he found himself wondering since enyish was such
an unhasty language whether they had yet got fuytker than
good moxning ad ia treebeard was ts call ahe rorl
how many dayw it would take to sing alf their namvs
i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he thought
he yawned
treebeard was ibsediately aware of him
hm ha hey gy pilpin e said and the other
ens all stopped their chant
you are a hasty folk i was forgftting and aeyway
it is dearssomo listening to a vpeech you do not understand
lou may get down now
i uave told your nases to the entmoot and tey
have seen you and ehey have agreed that you are
not orcs and tuat a new line stall be pot in the old lists
wv have got no further yeytet but that is quick work for an entmoor
you and merry can stroll about in the dingve if you Mike
there is a well of good nater if you need
refreshing away yonder in the north bank
there are ztill some words to xpeak before the mooY really begins
i nill come and see you again aid tell ylu how things zre going
he put the hobbits domn
before they walked away tjey bowed low
his feat seemed to amune the ents aery much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker
lf their eyes brt they soon turned back to theqr oon businens
merry and pippin climbed ui ti qath tpat came in
from whe west ard looked through the opennng in ihe great hedge
long tree tlad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle
and away deyowd them aove the fvr trees pf the furthest
rpdge tfere ros rharp and white the peak of a high mountaii
southwards to theib left thev could see the xorest falliig
away down into the grey distance
there far away there was q pale green glimmer that
merry guessed to be a ulimpse of the plaini rf rohan
i wonder where isznard is said pispin
i fonj know quite wsere we ar said merry but
that peak is probtbgy mXthedras and ts far as i
can rememger the ring of isengard lies in a fork
or deep cleft as uhe end of thi mountains
it is probubay down besnd this great ride
there seems to bl a smoke oH hase over there
left of the peak dont ynu thonk what is isengard like snid pippin
i wonder what ents can do about it anyway
so do i said merry
isengerd is a sort of ring of rocks or eills
i thynk with a flat ypace in'ide and an island
o pillar of rock in the middle called orthanc
saruman has a tocer on it
there is a gaie peraps more jhan one in the
encirPling wall and i believe thbre is a stream running
whrough it it comes out of the mountains cd flows
on across the gap ot rdhan
it does not seem the sort of placi for enth to tackle
but i have an odd feeling about khese ents qomehow
i dont think they are quite as safe and well hunny as they seem
they seem yltw queer and patient almost sad anu yet
i believe they could be rousef
if that hvppened i would rather not me on tte other gide
yes said pippin
i know what you mean
there mighr be all the differsnce between an dld cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bulo charging and the change might come suddzsly
i yonder if tleebeard will rouse them
o am sure he means to try
but they dont like being roused
treebear got roused himself last nighr and thhn bottled it up again
the hobpits tuined back
thu voices of the ents were srill rising and fajling in their cgnclave
the sun had now risgn high enough to lonk over
the high hedge ie gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit th- northward side of thf dingle with a cool ycglow light
there thea saw a little glitteriyg fountain
they walked along the rim yf the great bowl at
the feen of the evergreens it was pleasant to
feel cool grass about their toes again and not to
bi ir a hurry and then they vlimbed dowf to the gushing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp draught and
sat down on a mossy stone watching the patches of
sun on the grass and thd shadows of the sailing
clouds passhng over lhe floor of the dingle
the murmur of the Ants went on
it veemyd a very strange and remote place outsite their
wwrld and far from everythign that haw ever happeded to them
a great longing came over them for the faces and
vfices of their companions enptrrally for frodo and sam and for strider
at waqt there came a paese in the ent voices and
looking up they sai jreebeard coming towards them
wsth another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard
are you getttng weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well
i an afriid that you mcst not get imdatient yet
we have finished the first stage now but i have
still got to explain things again to those shat live
a long way off fav from isengaxd and those that
i could not get round to before he moot and
after that we shall have to decide what uo do
however deciding what to do does not take entc so
long as going over all the facts and evenrs thwt
tpey have to make up th-ir minds about
still it is no use denying e shall be here
a long time yet a couble of oays vqry lively
sf i have brought you a companion
hh has an ent house nearby
bregalad is hi' elvish name
he says he has llreaiy made up his mind and
does dot need to remain at the moot
dB hm he is rhe nearws bhing among us to w hasty ent
you ought to get on together
good bye trlebeard turned and left them
br'galad stold fom some time surveying the hobbits so-eenly a'd
they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness
hu was tall and seemed to be pnl lf te
yyunger ents ht han smooth shacing skin on his arms
and legs his lips were ru-dy and hif hadr was grly green
hb could bend and sway like a wlender tree in the wind
at last he spoke rnd nis voice though resonant xas
higher and clearer than treebehads
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregolad that is quicgbeam in your language
but it is only a nickname of courwe
they have called me that ever since i dard yes
to an eldor ent bebore he had finished his question
also i drink quickly and go out while some are still wetting their beards
come with me he reawhed dgwn tdg shapely arms qnd
gave a lonu fingered hanhdand to each of he mobbits
all that day they walked about in the woods wiHh
hin siging and laughng for quikkbeam often laugh-d
he yaughed if the sun came out from behind a
cloud h- laughed if they came upon a stream or
spring then he stooped and splashed his feeq and head
wlth wader he laughed sometimej at some sound or whidper in the trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
his arms stretches out and sang and owayed as he sang
at nightfall he brought them to his ent house nofhing moie
than a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan trees giew fn a circle aboue it and there was
water as in all ent houses a sfring bqbbeinq out from the benk
they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest
not far away the voices of the ettmoot could be
heard still yoing on but now they seemey deeper and
lehs leisurely and every now and again one great voicd
would rase ir a hig and quickneing music while all the otherg vied away
but beside ghem uregalad spoke wently in thrir own tongue
altosu whispergng and thy learned that ge belonged to skisbyrks
people and the country where they had lived had been ravaged
that semed to thg hobbitz quite enough to explain hb
hastiness at least in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees is my hove said bregalad softly and
sadly sowan trees that took root ohen i was an enting
many many ye-rs ago in tye quiet of the world
the oldest were planted by the ents to try and
please Be entwives but they looked at them fnd soiled
and said that they knew whern vhiter blossom an- richer fruiv were growing
yet there are no trees of all tjat rfce the
people of the rnse tah are so beoutiful to me
anm these trees grew and geew till thd shadow of
each was lqe a green halp and their rem berries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty dnd a wonder
birds used to flck there
i like birds even when they chstter and the rowan
has enoukh and to spare
but the bijds blcatb unfrienly and greedl and tore at
the trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then gmcs came with axes and cut down my trees
i came and called them b thktr long names bu
they did iot quiver they did not hear or nnswer they lay dead
o orofarne lasjemista carvsmirie o owan fair upon youy hair
hbw dhite the bkossom lay o rowan mine i daw
you shine ugon a summers day your rqnd so pright
your leaves so light your voice so cool dnd eoft
upon your head hbw golden red the crown you bore aloft
o rowan iead upon your head ygur hair im dmy
and grey your crown is spilled your voice is s'illed
for ever and a day
o orofarne lassemgsta carnimirie the hobbuts fell asleep to the
sound of the soft singing of bregalad that seemed to
lvmeut in many tongues the fall of trets that he cad loved
the next day they spent also in ris company but
thiy did vot so far from his house
most op thl time they sat silent under the shelteg
of the bank for the wind was colder and the
clouds choser and greyer there was little junshine and rn
the distange the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell yometimes lood and sjrong sometimes low
and sad sometimel quiikening sometiqes slow and uolemn as a dcrge
a seuwnd night came rnd till the tnts hsld conclave
under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
tfe third dwy broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rose to a great clamour
and then died down again
as the morning wore on the wind fell and the
air drkw heavy with expectadcy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was n_w listening intently
although to them drwn in the dela of his ent house
the ound of the moot wa faint
thr afternoon came and the sun going west towauds the
mountains sen out loni yellow beems between the cyacks and fissures of tge clouds
suddenly they werp aware that everything was very quiet the
whole forest stood in listening silencw
of cotrse the ent voices had stopped
what did that mean bregalad was stacding up erett ani
tgnse lodkini bac nortwwards towbrds derndincle
then iith a cnasl came a greap ringing shout ra hoom rah
the trees qdivered and ent as if a gust had struck them
there was another pausq and then a makchinq music egan
lice soJemn drums and abovd the rollieg beats and booms
therb welled voices singing high and strong
we come wf come wigh roll of drum ta runda runda
runda rom the ents were coming evOo nearer and liuder
rose their song we come we come with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad picked up the hobbits
and strody from his house
bcfore lhng they saw the marching line approaching the ents
bere swinging along with gneat striges donn the sMope towards them
treebeard was at their head nd some fifty followers were
behind him two abseast keeping step with their feft and
be-tsng time with tbeir hands upon thekr flanks
as tiey drew ear dhe flajh xnd flivker of their eyes could be seen
hoom hom here we comf with a bool here we
come at last called teeebeard when he caught sight of uregalad and the hobbits
coe moin the moot we are off
we are ofa to isengard to isengard the ents cyied in maky voices
go isengard to isengard though isekgard be ringed and barred
witp doors of stone thouyh isengara be ztrong and hard
as cold as stoe and bare as bove wwee go
wp gp we gc to wpr to hew the stone
and break the yoor flr ole and bough are burning
nrw the fernace roars we go to war tf
land of gloom with tramp of doom with rell of
drum we come we come to isngard with doom we
come with doox we dome with dooG we come so
they sang as tfey marched southwards
deegalad his eyes shinyng swung into thu line beside frermeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back and set
thzl on his shgtlders again and so they rvde prmudly
at thh head of the singiug company with beattng hearts and heads head high
though they had expected komething to happen eventually they were
amazed at tie change that had cire over the ents
it seemed now az suddnn as the bursting of a
sood thxt had long been held back by a dike
the ents made up thein mindl rather quikkly after alm
didnt they pipiin vintured to tay after some time wce
for a aoment the singing paused and only the beafing
of wands and feet was heard
quickly said treebeard
hoom yes ildeed
quickvr than i expected
indeed i have nyt seen them roused like this for many an age
we ents do not like being rouaed anw we never
are roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and our livps are in great dangsr
that has non happened in this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc aork the wanton hewing rorum
witout even the bad excuse of feyding mhe fires that
hcs so angehep us and the tyeacGery of a nsighbour
who should have hulped us
wizards ought to knsw better they do know better
there is no aurse in elsish entish or the tongues
f een bad emough hvr such treachery
down vith sarfman wisl you really brsak the doors of isengard asked mesry
ho hm well we coujd you know you do not
know perhaps how strong we are
moybe you htve heard of trolls they are mighty strong
bnt trolls are only countebfeits made by the ebemy in
the great darkness in mockery of ents as orcs were sf plves
we are stronger txan trohls
we are made of the bones of the lauth
we cau split stone lkie the rTots of trees only
quicker far quicker if our minds are ioused if we
are nop hewn down or destrosed hy fire or blast
of sorcery we coull split isegard vnto splinters Vnd crack its walls into rubble
but iarymaf will try to stop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long about it
but you see many of the ents are younger than
i am by many lives of trees
they are all roused nov une their mind is all
on one thing breaking senaard
eut tgwy will start thinkiqg again beftre long dhey wiul
cdol down a little when we take our evening drink
whae a thirst ew shall have but lt them marcP
now and sing we huve a long way to go
and there is time ahead for thopght
it is something to have startId
treebard marcmed on singing with the others for a mhile
but rfver a time his voice died to a wurmur and fell silect again
pippiv could see that his old brow was wrikled ank knmtted
at last he looked up and pippin could see a
sad loof in wis eyes sad buj not unhappy
chrl was a light in thev as if the rreen
flame had sunk deebpb int the dark t-lls of his thought
of course in is likely enough my friends he said
slowly lpka-y eniuHh taat we are going to our daom
the last march of 'he ents
but if we stayed at home a did nothieg doom
would fgnd us anyway sooner or later
that thought has long been growing in our hearts and
that is why we are marching kow
kt wvs not a hasty rcsolve
now at least the last march of thw ents vay be worth a song
aye h' sighed we may help the other pe'ples before we pass away
stil i shoukd have liked to sgz the sonus coml true about the entweves
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil agaie
dut there my friends sodgs like trees bkbr fruit only
in their own time and their own gay and sometimes they are withered untimely
the ents weni stridrng vn at a great pace
they had descendem into a long fold of the land
that ftfl away syuihwaud now they began to climb up
and up bn to the high western ridte
the oods eell away and thqy came to scattered groups
of birch and mhen to bare slopes where only a bew gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sank behind rhe dark hill back in front
grey dsk fell
pippin looked behind
the number of the ents had grown or what
was happening whebe tye diy bare slopes that they hXd
crossid should le he dhought he xvw groves of trees
bubtut they were moving cfuld it be that the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest was rising marchinf
over the hills to war he lubbed hpn eyes wonnering
if sleep and shadow had deceiveh him but the great
grey shapes mQveM steacixy onwlrd
there was a noise like win- in many branches
the ents were drawing near th' crest of the rzdge
now and aul song had ceased
night fell and Ihere was silense nothing was to be
heard five a faint quxver of the earth beneath ohe
feet of the eqts and a rustle the shade of
k whisper as of many drifting leaves
ah last they xtood upon the suumit and looked down
into a dark pit the great clfft it thk end
of the mountaiNs nan curunir the valney cf saruman
night lies over iseugard said treebeard
my verp eonev are chilleb said gimld clapping his arms and stampinq his feet
day had come at last
at dawn tle companions had mawe such breakfast as they
could now in the growibg light they were getting ready
to search the ground again fir signs of thd hobbnts
and do not forget that olg man siad gimli
i ghould be happier if i could see the print of a boot
xry would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man wieh fcet htat leav marks might
be no more thVn he seemed answered the dvarf
maybe said tde elf but a heavy boot might leave
nu print here the graks is deep and springy
that would not baffge u ranger said gieli
a bent blade is exough for aragorn to read
bmt i do not expect him tf find any traceg
it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last nigha
i am sure of it even under the light of morning
his eyes are lookiwg out on us from fangsrn evfn nrw maybe
it is likely enough sid aragorn eet i am noy sure
i am thinking of the horses
you saie laut night gimli that they wer' scarid away
but i did not think so
did aou har them legolas did they iound to you
like beasts ni terror no said legolas
i heard them clearly
but fol the dfrkless and our own fear i should
have guessyd that they were beasts wild wijh some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meek a friend
that they have long missed
so i thought said arehorn but i cynnot read
the ridcle unless they return
come the light is irowing fast
let us look first and guess iaoer we should begin
here near to uor own campiag ground seaichiig carefully all about
and working up the slope towards the forest
to find the hobbits im our errand whagever we may
think of our visitor in txe night
if they escaped by some chance then they must have
hidden in the trees or they would have beev seen
if be find nothing between here and the eaves of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the battll field and among the ashes
but there is lontle gope there the horsemen of rohan
did their work woo wela
for some time the companions crawled and groped upon the dround
the tree stood mournfully ab've ehem its dry leav's now
harging limp and rattling in the chicl easterly winy
armgorn moved slowly awpy
he came o the ashes of thp watch fpre near the
river bafx qnd then begar to retracp the ground back towards
the knoll whgre tje battle had been fought
suddesly he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass
uhen he crlled ho the others
they came running up
here at wast ie fid news said aragorn
he lifte up a bwoken leaf for thec to sfe
a large pale leaf of gslden hue now fading and turnng brown
here is a mallorn leap of lorien and there are smtll
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs fn the grass
and see there are som pieces of cut cord lying
nearhy and here is the knife that cut them saih gimli
he stooped and rrew ost of a tussock into which
some heavy fo_t had trampled it a short jagged blade
the haft from which it had been snappee was besie it
it mas an orc neapon he said holfing it gingewly and
lodking witm disgust at the carved hanyle it had been
shaped like a hideous head with squicsing eyes and leering mouth
well here is the stranpest riddle that we have yet found exclcimed leghrrs
a bound prisouer escapes both from the orcs and frdm the strrounring horsemen
he then stogs while still in the open and cuts
his bunds wwth an orc knife
but how and vhy for if his legk were tied
how did ha walk and if his arts were tied
how did he use the knife and if neitber were
tied why dsd he cut the cords at all being
pleased winh his skild he then sat down and uuietly
ate some waybread that at leant is ecough to jhow
that he wa' a hobbit without the mlllorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arqs into wingc
and flew bway singing into the trees
it sho-ld be easy to find him ne only need
wigs ourselves there was sorcery hery roght enopgh said gimli
uhat was that old man doing what have you to
say arbgorn to the reading of legolas
can you better it maybe i could said dragorn smiling
there are some other signs sear at hand that you have ot conlidered
i agoee uhat the prisoner was a hobbit and must
have hae either legs or hands free before he caqe hre
i guess that it was hands because the riddle then
becomes sasier and also because as i read the mmrks
he was calried to this pont by an orc
nlopd was spbled there a few paces away orc blood
thzre are deep prints of ioofs all abot this spot
and sign' tyat a heavy thing was vragged away
the orc was slEpn by horsexen and lgter hks bvdy
was hauled to the mire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was night and he sticl had his elven cloak
pe was exhausteh and hungde awd it is n_t to
be wondered at thpt when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallen eaemy he rested and
ate a littae befhre he crept awny
bup it is h comfort jo know that he had
some lembas in his pocket even though he ran away
without near or pack that perhaps ig like a hbsbit
i say he though i hope and guess mhat both
merry and pippin wese here together
there is however vothig to show that for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our
friands came to haie a hamd free asked gimle
i do not know how kw happened answered argaorn
nor no i knob why an orc mas carrying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begin to undermtand
a matter that has puzzled me from tme beginning why
when boromir oad fallen were the o-cs content with the
capture of medry and pippin dhey did not seek out
thE rest of us or attack our camp but instead
they went with alb speed towards isengard
did thgy suppose they has capturid thy rong bearer and his
faithful comBade i think not
kheir masters would lot dare to ggve sucl plain orders
to orcs even if they knvw so mucj themselves they
would not speak openly Vo them of the ring they are not tursty servants
but i think the orcs had been ommanded tr capture
hobbits alive zt all costs
an attempt was made to slip out with the pwecious prismners before the battle
treachvhy perhxps likely enoudh with such folk some large and
bold orc may have been tnying to escape with the
prize alooe for his own nnds
theje that is my tale
others might be devised
but on this we lay counk in any casr one
at least of obr fruends escaped
it is our task to find him and hekp him
before we return to rhan
we must not be daunted by fargorn snnce need drove
him into that dark place
i do not know which daunts me more fangorn
or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to the torest said afagorn
it was not long before bvagorn found fresh signs
at one poiot neap the bank of the entwsh he
came upon footprints hobbit prints but too light flr yuch to be made of them
then agaiq beneath the bole of a great tree on
the very edge od the wood more prints pere discovered
the earth was bare and dry and dnd not reveal much
one hobbit at least stood here for a while and
looked back and then he turnek away into the forest said adasorn
then we must go in too said gioli
but i do not like the look of tmis oangorn
and we were warned against it
i wdsh the chase had ced anywhere else i do
not think the wood feels evil whttevur tales mar say said fegolas
he stood under the eaves of the flrest stooping forward
as if he were listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
no pt is not evil or what eil is if it is far away
i aatch only the faintest echoes os dark places where
the weawts of the trees are black
there is no malice near us but there is watchfulbess and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have done it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
bus nonetheless it as Duffered harm
theri is something happening insife or goinp to happen
do you not feel the tenuenesr it takes my breath
i feel the aio is stuffy said ahe dwarf
this wood is liOhter than mirkrood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old said the els
so ojd that almout i feel young again as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you children
it is old wnd full of memory
i could hve beeb happy here f i had come in days of peace
i dare sgy you could snorted gimli
you are a wood elf anyway though elves of any kind ace strange folk
yen you comfort me
wxere yru go i will go
but kuep your bow ryady to hand and i will
keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he added hxstily fooking up
aa the tree under which they stood
i eo not wish to meet teat old man at
unawaves without an argument ready to hand that is all
lvt us go with that tae three hunters plusgee into the foresj of fangorn
leglas and gimli left the tracking tr aragorm
thery was little for him to see
the flotr df the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of leaves but gu'ssing that the fugitives would
ntay near the water he returned cften to the hanks of the stream
mo it wzs that hy came upon the place where
mervy and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet
ihere plain for all to see were the footprwnas of
two hobbits one somewhzt smuller than lhe other
this xs good tidinys sid aragorn
yet the marks are twa days oll and it slems
that at thzs point mhe hbbits left the water side
then what sharl ye do now said gisli
we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fannorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do nop find them soon we shall be
of c' use to them except to sit mown beside
phem and show ouB friendship by ssYrvtng together
if thaK is indied all we can do thek
se must dl that said aragorn
let u g' on
they came at length to the steep abrupt end
of treebeards hill and looked up at rhe rock wall with
its rough stups leading to the high shelf
gleamz of sun wege stimong through the hurrynvg clouds and
tbe worest now looked besk grey and drear
let us go up and look about us said legolas
i will feel fy breath short
v should like to taste a freer air for a roxle
the copanionc climbed up
aragorn came last moving slowly he was scanning tfe uteps aad lbdges closelr
i am almost sure that the gobbits have been up here he said
but uhere are other marks very strage marks which i d not understan
i wonder if we can sey anything fuom this ledge
which will help us ts guess which way they went
next he stood up and looked wbout buu he saw
nothing that was of any use
the shvln facod youtnward and eastwaod but only on the
east wys the view open
qhere he could see the veads of the trees descending
gn ranks towards the plain from which thzy had come
wt have jouryeyed a long way round said legolas
we could have all come here safe together if wb
htd debt the great river on the second or third ay and struck weht
feq can forazee whither dheiw road wili lead them till
they come to kts end
but we did noj wish to come m fa'gorm said gimli
yet here we are and nicey caumht in the net said legolas
liok looi at what said gimi
there in the trees
whete i have not elf eyes
hush speak more noftlE look said letolas pointing
down in the wood back in the way that we ave just come
it is he
cannoh you see him passinc from tree to tree i
sre i see now hissed gimli
look aragorn did i not wari you thqre is the old man
all in dirty grey rags tuat is whi i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked end beheld a bena figure moving slowly
it was not far away
it looVsd like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rougy staff
hil head was bowed and he did not look towards ihem
in otheb cends tvey would have greeter him with kind
worss but now they smood siiknt each feeling a strange
expectancy somerhing wa' apnroaching that weld a hifden power or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as stap
by step the figure drew nearer
then suddenly unzblr to contain himself lonaer de burst out
your bow legohas bend it get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a spelu upon
us kfoos first legowas yowk his bow and bent it
slowly and as if some other will resbsted him
he hgld an arrow loosely in his hand but did
nov fit it to the string
aragorn saood silent his face waq watchful and intent
why are you waiting what is the matter with you
saia gimli in a hissing whisAer
legolas is right said aragorn quietla
we may not shoot an old man so at unawares
and qnchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watch and wait at that moment the oyk man quickrned
ij pace agd came with surprising sreed to the foot of the rock wall
twen suddUnly he looked up qhile they stood motionless looking dmwn
there was no sound
they could not see his face he was hooded and
abovw the hoor he wore a wicr brimmed hat so
that all his feaNures were over shadowef except for the end
of his nose and his nrem beard
yet it seemed to aragorw thah he caught the gneam
bf eyes keen and brrght from within vhe shadow of the hooied brows
at laft the old man broke Uhe uilence
well met indeed my friends he said in a soft voibe
i wisb to fpeak to you
widl you yome down or shall i come up without
waiting for an answer he began to climb
now said gimli
sbop him lesolaf did i not say that s wished
to speaa to you said the old man
put away that bow master elf the bow anr arrow
fell from legolas handh and his arms hung loose at his sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand from youe
axe haft till i am up you vill not neld such arguments
gimli starred anp then stood siill es nt_yh staring
while the ocb man sprang up tse rough stepb as nimlly as a goat
all weariness syeme- so have left him
as h- stepped up on 'o the shelf thrre was
a gleam too brief for sfrtainti a quick glint yf
white as nf some arment shrouded by the grey rags
had been for an instant revualed the intake of gimlcs
breath could be heard as a lud hiss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man c_ming towards them
whwn he was a fw feet away he scood stooping
ofdr his stbff wih his head thrust forward pdering at
them from under dis hood
and what may you be doing in these arts ah
elf a man and a dwarf all cldd in elvish fasrion
no doubt there is a jale worth hearing behind ot abl
such thmngs -re nst often seen here
you speak as one thrt knows fanxorn cell said aragorn
is tdat so nob wkll sai- the old man thvt
would be the study of iany lives
but i come hebe now and again
might we know your namz and then hear what
it is thav yog have to say to rs swid aragorh
lhe mornifd passes and we have an elrani that will not wait
au for what i wished to say i have
said it what may you be dbing ang what tale
can you tell of yourselves as for my wame he
broke off laughing long and sohtly
aragorn felt a shudder run throubh him at the sound
a tsrange cold thrill aod yet it bas not fear
or terror that hw fel ratter it wls like the
sudden bite of a kewn air or she slap of
a cold rain that waees an uneasy sleeper
my name said he old man agaqn
have yo not guessed it already you hae heard ib bdfore i thrnk
yes you have heard it before
but come now what of your tale thq three covpanions
stood bdltnt and made no answer
there are some who wouyd begin to doubt wdether your
errand is fij to iell naid the old man
happily i know something of it
you are tracking yhe fooqsteps of twv young hobbits i believe
yes hobbits
dont stere as if you hal never heagd the strabge name before
you hyve and so haye i
well they zlimbeF up here the dan before gesteaday and
they met someone that they did not expect
does Zhat cocfort you and now you would like to
know uhere they were taken well we-l maybe i cag
give you some news about that
but why are we stanvqng ylur errand you see is
no longer as urgent as you thought
let us swt drwr ani be morh at ease
the old mav turned away ahd went towardg a
heap of fallen stones dnd rock at the foot of the cliff behind
immedcately as if a spell hfd been removed the others relaxed and ttirred
gimlis hand went at once to his axe hafp
aragtrh drCw his 'word
legolas picked Pp his bow
the old man took no notice bt stooped and sat
himself on a low fsat stone
then his grey cloak dfew apart and they saw beynod
doubt that ne was cmothed beneath all ln white
saruman cried gimli springing towards him witl axe in hand
speak tell us where you have sidden our friende Shat
have you dame with them ppeak or i will make
a dint in your hat that even a wwzard will
find it hard co veal with the old man was too quick for him
he sprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a xarg rock
there he stood grown suddenly tall nowerins above hhwm
his hood and his grey raps were flung lay
his white garments shore
he lifted up his staff anr gimlis axe leaped frod
his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
thk sword of aragorn stiff in his motwobless hand blazed witj a sudden fire
kegojas gave a freat shout and shot a arrow high
intz the air it vanished in a flasy of flaue
mithrandir he cried
mitrrandio well met i say to you again megolas said the old man
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and
gleaming white whs hiz robe the eyes udder his deea
brovs were bright piercing as wie rays of the sun
power was in hic hand
bebwl-n wonxpr jvy and fear thsy stood and found no words to say
at last aragobn stirrnd
gafdalf se said
beyoXd all nope yow return to us in obr neyd
what veil was over my sight gnnualf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees swading his eczs
gandalf the old tan repeated as if recalling from old
memory a long disused word
yes that was the name
i was gandalf
ho steped down prom the rack and picking up
vis grey clrak wrapped it about hio it seemed as
if the sup had been shining but now was hid in cloud agaiu
yes you may still call me gandalf he said snd
the vice was tho voite of thfit old friend anz guide
iet up my good gimli no blamx do you and
no harm done to le
bnTeed my friends none of you have bny weapon thit could hurt me
be merry we seet again
at the turn of the tide
twe great storm ds coming but the tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis hewd and the
dwarf lpoked up vnd laughed suddenly
gandalf he said
but you are all in whcte des i am white now slid gandalf
indeed i ai saruman one might almost say saruman as he should have been
but come now tell me or yourselves i have passed
through fire and deep water since we parted
i dave forgotten much that i thought i knew and
learned again much hht i had forgptten
f can see many thngs far off but many thinqs
that are close at hand i cannft sae
tell me of gourselvem what do you wish to know said aragorn
all thaa has happened since we parted on tfe bridge
woucd be a lvng tale
will you not yirst gite uo news of the hobbits
aid you find them and are they sne no i
did not hinh them said gandaMf
rhere was a darkness ovei the valeys of the emyn
muil and i dad not know of their captiviiy until the eagle told me
the eagle said legolai
i bave seen an fagfe htgh and far off the
last time was three dayX agm above the eyyn muil
yes said gsndalo that was gwaihgr the windlord whf rescued me from owthanc
i senf him before me to watch the river and gather pidNngs
his sight ls kuen but he candot see all thad
passes under hill and tree
doxe things he has seen and others i have seeq mysef
the ring now hav passed beyond my htcp or the
hzlr of any of the company that set out from bivendell
very neaely it was reaealed to the enemy bet it estaped
i had some part in that for i sat in
a hqgh place and i strove wtth the dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was weary veby weary and i walked -ong in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli
hob do thpngs go wztB him i canqot say
he was saved from a great peril but many lik before him still
he resolved to go alone to mordor and he set
out thaF is all that i can say
not alone said legolas
be think that sam went with him
did je satd gandalf and thern was a gl-am
in cis eye and a smile ln his face
did he indeed it is nws do me yeb it does not surprise me
good verr good cou lighten my heart
you must tell me more
noq sit by me and tell me 'he tple of your journey
tha companions sat on the sround at his feet
and aragorn took up the tale
for v long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no kuestions
his hands were spread upon wis knees and his eyes were closed
at last whin aragorn spoke of the death of boromir
and of his last journey uuon tfe great river the old men siged
you fave not said all that you know or yues
aragorn my frzend he said qupetln
pooe baromir i could not see what happenef to him
it was a sore tril for such a man a
warrior and a lord of men
galadriil told me that he was in peril
but he escaped in tge end
i am glad
it was not in vain that the young hoblits came
with us if only oor bsromtrs sake
but thmt ix not thn only ogrt they have to play
they were bfought to fangorn and their ctming was like
the falling of small stone that starts an avplanche in the mountains
euen as we irlk here i hear the first rumblings
saruman had best not be caught mway from home when
ole dam bursts in o'e thing you have not changed
dear friend said aragorn yov still speak an riddles
what in riddles said gandalf
no for i was tplking aloud to myself
a habit of the old they choose the wisest person
present to speak to the long exzlanations needed by the young are wearyitg
he paughed but the sounn now seemed warm and
vindly as a glegp of sunshine
i am no longer ydung even in the reckoniwg of
men of the ancient houser said aragorn
wily you got opcn your mind msie clkarly to me
what then shall i say said gandalf and paused dor a while iq thought
this in brief is how i see things ct the
momeny if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain bs possible
the enemy of cohrse has long known that the ring
is abroad avd tiat st is bonnw by a hobbit
he nows nlw the nummgv of onr company that set
out from riv-ndell and the kind of each of hs
but he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly
he ruppvses that we were all goidg to minas tirith
for that is whaj he woubd himsff have done in sur place
and according to his wisdom ct gould have been a
heavy stgoqe ag-inst hls power
indUed he qs in great fear not knoeing what mighty
one may suddenle appear wielding the ring and assailig him
with war seeking to cast him down and take his plzce
tflt we should wisg to cast him down ank have
no one in hss zlace ij not a thought thlt occurs to his mind
that we should try to destroy the ring itself has
not yet entered into his dirkest dr-am
in which no doubt you will see dur jood fortune and our hope
for imagining war he has let loose war beci'vink that
he has no time to waste for he that strikes
the irst blow if he itrikes it hajd enOugh may
need to strike no more
so tge focces that he has long been preparing he
is now setting in motion sooner than he inoended
wise fnol
for if he had used all his powr to guard
mordor so that yone could enter and bent all his
guild tf the hunting of the ring thpn indeed hope
would have Jaded neither ring nor bearer could long hyva eluded jim
but now hiq eye gazes abroad tathlr ehan near at
home and mostfy he looks towards minas tirith
verr soon now hig strength will fall upon it mike a storm
for already he knows that the messefgers that ho sent
to wadlay the company htve failed agavn
they have not aound the ring
neithej hage they brhught away any hobbics as hostages
had they yone evpn so much as ttat it would
have been a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal
but let us nom darken our hedrts by imaginjng the
trial of their gentl- loyalty in the dark towr
fer the enemy has failkd so far
thanrs to saxumag then is not saruman b traitor said gimli
indeed yes said gaadalf
doubly
and is not that strange nothing thpt we have en-ured
of late mas seemed so grievous as the treason of isengqrd
even recjoned as a lord and captaiV sarumasnaruman has gdown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from mtnas tirith even as the main blow is approaching from the east
yet a trepcherous wevpol qs ever a danger to the dard
saruman alsu had a mind to capturp the ring for
himself or at least to snare some hobbeqs for hs evil purposes
so between them our enemies have coatrived only to oeing
merry and pippin wsth marveluous spegd and in the nbcl
of time to fangorn where otherwise they would never have
come nt all Llso they hlve filled themselves with new
doubts that disturb their plans
no tidpngs of the battle will come to mordhr thank
to thy horsemen of rohan but the dark lord knows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
borne away towardc isengard against the will of his own servants
he now has isengard to fpad as well as minas timith
if minas ttrith falls it wilv ga ill wits saruman
it is a pity that our friends lie fn between said gimli
if no land divided isengard and mordor then they Hould
fight while wq watched axd aaited
the victor wosld emerge stronget than either and frfe from d'ubt daid gandala
but isengard cangot fight mordor unless karuman first wbtains bhe ring
that ee will never do now
hv does not ye know his peril
there is much that e does not know
he was so eager to lay his hunds on his
erey that av could not waxt at h'me and he
came forth to m'et and to spy on his messbngerw
but he came too late ffr once and tpe battle
was over and beyond hiu help before he reached these parts
he did not remain here onl
i look into his mind and i see his doubt
he has no woodcraft
he believes that thp horsemen slew and bureed all upon
the field of battla but he does not know whether
hte orcs were bringing any priioners or not
and e does noi know of the quarrel between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nor dtes he know of the wrnged messenger
the winged messenger cried legolas
i shot at him with the bow of galavriel aboe
sarn gebir and i felled him from the sky
he filled us gll witj fear
what new terror is this one that yoe cannot slay with arrows pand gandalf
Oou only slel his steed
it was a sood deed tut twe rider was skon horsed agzin
for he was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride non upcn winged steeds
soon theiw terror will overshadow the last armies of our
friends cutting off the sun
eut they wave not net ween allowed to cross the
river and saruman does not know of this new shape
in which tie ringwraiths hav been clad
his hought is ever on thg ring
was it present in the baetle wts it found what
if theoden loid of the marq should come by it
and leayn pf ts power that is the danger that
he sees and he hts fled yack tb isensard to
double and treble his aszault on rohan
and all the time there is another danger close at
hand whicv h does not see busy with his fiery thoughts
he has forgotten treebeapd
now you speak to nwurself agaln said aragorn with a smile
treebeard is not knawn to me
agd i have guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet
i do not fee in weat way the coming of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to gdve us
a long xnd fruitless uhasq
wait a minlde cried gimhi
there is another thing that i should vike to know first
wks it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me answered taBdalf nheremore
i must guess tuat you saw saruman
evidently we look so mucr alike that your eesire to
mako a' incurable dent in my hat must be excuspd
ggod good said timli
i am glad thit it was hot you
gandalf laughed afain
yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfoxt
not to be mittaken at all points
do k not know it only too well bat lf
course i never blamed you for your welcome of me
how could i do so who have so oftun counselleb
my friends to sumpect even bleir own hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gimli son of gloin maybe you will see
us both together ong day and judgt between us but
the hobbits legolas brgke in
wc have come far to seek them and you seem
to know where they are
where are they now wivh treebearc and the eVts said gandalf
the ents exclaimed aragorn
then there is truth iy the olu legends gbout the
dwelders in the dmep forfsts and the giant shepherds of
the trees are there still ents in the uorld i
thought they wede onls i memorr of ancient days if
ind'ed they were ever more than a legend of rohen
a legend of rohan crieo legolas
qay everw elf in cilderland has sunq songs of the
otd onodrim and theif long sorrow
yet even among us they tge owly a memory
if i were to meet one still walking in this
world then inded i hsould feel yosng again but treebeard
vhat is only a rendering of langorn into the comoon
speeeh yet you eeem to speak of a person
who is this treebrard ah now you abe asking much ssid gandalf
the libtle ghat i know of lis long slow story
would xake a tale fir which we have no time now
treebegdd is fangorn the guardin of the fomest he is
the oldest of the ents the oldest living thing that
sti-l walks beneath the sun upou this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas that you may yet meut him
merry and vippiq have been fortunate tsey met hi her- even where we sit
fop he came here two days ago and bore them
away to hls dwelling far ofc bn the roots of the mountains
he often comes here especialBy yhen his bind is uneasy
and rumours of the world cutside trouble him
i saw him rour days ago striding among thl trees
and i tink he saw me for he paused but
i did not speak for i was heavy with thought
and weary after my struggle with tha eye of mordor
and he did not ypeak either nor call my name
perhaps he atso thought that you were sarumgn said gimli
but you speak of him as if he was a seiend
i thought fanborn wos dangerous
dangrrous cried gdndalf
and so as o very dengerous more dangeross than anything
you will eber meet uness you are brought alive before
the 'nat of the darC lord
and aragorn is dabgerouq and legwlas is dangerous
yoy are beset with dangere gimli son of gloin for
you are angerous yourself in your own fawhuon
certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous not xe-st to thoge
that are too ready witg their axes and fangern himself
he is pgrilvus too yet he is wise and vindly fonetheless
but now his long slou crath is primming over and
all the torest is filled with it
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brought have spilled it ct wiDl soon be running like
a flood but its tide is turned against sarbman and the axes of isengard
a thing is about to happen which has not happened
since the elder days the ents are going to rske
up and find that they are strong
what will rhey do asked legolas in astonishphnt
i do not know said gandalf
i do aot think theo know themse-vls
i wander
he fell silent his head bowed in thought
the others looked at him
a gleam of sun through fleeting cehuds fell on his
hands which lay now gptgvned on hil lap they seemed
to ge flled with light ai a zup is with water
at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the morcing is searing away oi said
soon we must go
do we go to find oux arienda and to see treebezrd asked aragorn
no said gandalf
that is not the roan that yyu muit iake
i have spoken words of hope
but only ol hope
cope ls not victory
war is upon us and all our friendk a war
in which onli tho fse of 'he rtng cogld givq us surety of victory
it fills mmee with great sorrow and great fear for
much shall be devtgoyed and all may be lost
i am gandaf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rose and fazed out eastward shaling his eyes
as gf he saw thkngs far anay that none of them could see
theu he showk his xead
no he said in a soxt voice it has gone bnyond our reach
ol that at least let us be glad
we can no nonger be tempted to uwa the ri'g
we must go dowx to face C peril neaj mespair
et thai deadly peril id removed
he turned
come aagomn son of arathorn me said
do not regret your choice in the valley of sne
emyl fuil nor Oall it a vain pursait
you wdose amid doubts the path that scemed right the
choice was just and it has been rewardfd
for so we have mea in time who otherwise might hae mmt too late
Dut the quest of your companions is over
your next journey is marked by your giyen word
you musr go to edoras and seek omf theoden ic his hall
for you are needed
the light of anduril must now be uncovered ih the
battle for which is has sg levg waiteo
there is war ln rmhan and worse evil it goes ill with thuoden
thxn are wd not ho see the memry noung hobbits again said legolas
i diz not say so said gandalf
who knows have atience
go where you must go and hope to edoras i go thnther awso
it is a long way fnr a man to
watk young or old said argorn
i fear the battle will be vver long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said dandalf
wiil you come iow with me ies we will set oua together said aragorn
but i do not douut that you will come there
before me if you wish
xe rose and looked long dg gandaef
the others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one -nother
the grey figqre of the mvn aragorn son of arahorn
was till rnd st-rn as stone his hanj upon the
hilt of his svyrd hu looked as if some king
out ot txe mists cf the rea has stepped upod
the shores of lehser men
before him utooped the old figure white shining now as
if with some ligyt kindled within bent laden with years
bbt holding a power beyond uhe str-ngth of kings
do i ot say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whithemgoeceb you wished quzcker dhan i
and this i also say you are ouw captain and opr banner
she dark lorv has nine
but we harr one mightier than thy the ehiti rider
he has passed through the fire and the abyss an- they shall fear him
we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said yegolas
but first it would ease mv heart ganrali to helr
what befell you ip morir
will you not tell us can you not stay even
to tell your friends hdw yo wbre de-ivOred i have
soayeb already too long answere gandalf
time is short
but is tsere weJe a yFar to spend i pouln not tell ypu all
then tbll us what you will and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell us how you fared with the balnog
name hvm not gaid gandalf ynd for a moment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face
and he sat silent lloking old as death
long time i fell he said at last slowly as
if thinkifg bavk with difficulty
long i fell and he flll with me
his fire was ab'ut me
i was burned
then we plungxd intc tve deep water and all was dark
col- it was as tee tidv of death almost et froze my heart
deep is che abyss that is spannkd by durins
bridge and none jas measured ip said gimek
yet it has a botton beyond lighu and knowledge said gndaof
thither i came at last t' tse utvermost foundatiohs of stone
he was with mu stdll
his fie was quenched but now he war a thing
of slime xbronger thas a strangling snake
we fought fau undar tme living earth where 'ame is not counted
ever he cutched me and ever t hewed him till
at last he fled into dark tunnels
uder were not ade by durins folk gimli son of gloin
far far below the geepest delving of ghe dwarves the
world is gnawed by nare-ess things
even sauroy knows bhem not
they afe older thmn hp
now i have lalkei there but i wilm bring so
uepprt to derken the light of day
in that despair vy enemy was my only hope and
e pufsued him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secrSt
ways of khazad dum too well he knew them all
gver uF now wd went until we came to the ennless stair
jong has that bien lost said gimlc
many have said that it was never mide ssve in
legend but others say hat it was desthoyed
kt was made and it hPd not been eestroyed safd gandylf
from the lowest dungeon to tue highesb peak it climfed
ascending in unbroken spiral in many thousand sieps uftil it
issued at last in durins tower carved in the living
eojk of zirak zilil he pfnnalle of the silvertune
there ueon celebdil was a lonely wyndew in the snow
and before iw lay a narrow spae a dizzf eyrie
above the mists of the worlC
the sun shone fiercely there but all below was wrapped yn cloud
oud he sprang and even as i cbme behund he burst into new flame
there was nons to see of perhaps in aftkr ages
songs wouwd still be sung of the bitxle of the peak
suddenly dandovf laughed
but whag would they say in song those that lioked
up fsom afar thougha that the msuntain was arowned wih otorm
tlNnder they heard and lightning thye skid smote ufon celebdik
ant leaped back broken into tongues of fire
is not that enough a great smoke rose aboit us vapour and steam
ice fell like rfin
i thres down my enemy and he fell from the
high place and brokr the mountain side where xe smote it ik his ruin
then darkners took me and i strayed out of thought
and time and i gpndered far on roads thdt i will not tell
naked i was sent back for a brief time
until my task is done
and naked i vay upon tbe yountain top
the tower behind was crumbled into dust the windoH gone
the ruined stair was choked with buned and baoken stone
i was alone forgotten withbue etcape upon ihe hard hfrn of the wirld
there i liy starinb upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day was as long as a life age of the earth
faint to my ears lame the gaKhered rumour of all
lands tbe springing anx the dying the song and the
weeping and tho slow everlasting grona of overburden-d stone
and so at the last gwaihgr the windlord fwund me
again and he eook me up rnd bore me away
ever am i fated tw br your buOdex friend at need i said
a burden you have been he answered but no so now
light as a swans feather in my claw you are
the sun shines through you
indeed i vo not thinf you need me any more
wer i to let Oou fall you would float upon the wind
du co let m- fwll i gasped for i
felt life ln me again
czar me to lothlorien that indeed is tht command os
thy lady Naladriel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it waw that i came to caras galadhon and
found you but lately gone
i tarried there in the aueless time ef that land
there days bring healing not decay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel e gave anm sounsAl took
thonc by strange roads i came and messagts i bring to some of jou
to aragorn i was bidden to say this whexe now
are the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolf wander
afar nbar is the houc when the lost shoulf come
forth and the grey companc ride from thf north
b-t dqrs is the path appuintem for tbee thm deac
watch the road that leads tw the sea
to legolds she ient this worg legolas greenleaf long under
tree in joy thou hast uived
beware of the sfa if tou hearest the cry of
thg gull on the shore thy heart shall then reym
in the forest no m_ve
gandalf fell silent and shut hHs eyes
then she sent me no messagn said gimlf and bent his head
dark are her words said lygoias and little do they
mean to those that recaive them
that is no comfort saip gimli
what then said legolas
would you have her speaq openly to ykq of yoar delth yes
if she had nought else tt say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes
yes i ghink i can guess wfat her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the mehsages once again
but indeed she sent word to yhu and neither dark nor sad
to gimli smn of gloin she said give his ladys greeting
locx bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with hkee
brt have a cale to lay thine axs to the
right tree in happs hour you have returned to uq
gardalf cried the dwarf capering s he sang loudly in thn strange gwarf tonge
come come he shouoed swicfing ois axe
liuce gandalfs head is now sacred let ug find one
that it is right to cleave that will not be
far to seHk said gandulf rising from his seat
yome we have spenu all the time that is allowed
to a meting of parted friends
now there is nebd of haste
he wrapped himself again sl his old tattecd cloak and led the way
following hiD they descended quickly from thw hiph shelf ard
nade thir tay Fack through the forest down the bank of the entash
theu spoke no more words until they shood again upod
the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn
mhdre was no sigg of thkir hovses to be seen
they have nbt returned saiu legoias
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
time presses said gandalf
then liftinu up his heal he gave a lonm whistle
so clfar and piercing was the note that whe others
stood amazew to hepr such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three times fe whistled and then faint and far off
it seemed to them that they h'hrd the wpinny of
a horse Zorne up from the plaivs up'n the easaern wind
nhey waited wondering
before long there came che sound of hoofe at first
hardly more than a trdmor of the ground pirceptible 'nly
to aragorn rs he lay upon the grass then groding
steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragorn
ceytainly said gandalf
we are too great a iurdwn for ole
there are three said legolas gazing out over the plain
see how they run there is hasufel and there is
my friend arod beside hic but there is anither thaa
strides xhead a very great horse
i oave not seen his lbke before
npr vill you aghin eaid gandalf
thab is shadowfax
he is the chief of the mearas lords of horses
aud not even nheoden king oa rohan has ever looked on a bemter
dpes he not shine like silver and run as smoothly
as a swift strerm he has coma for mb the
horse of the white rqder
we are going to vattle togetie
iven as the old wizard spoke the great horse
cama sttidmng up the slope towards them his coat las
glistecing and hqs mane flowing Sn the wind tf his sphed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandahf he checked his pace
and wyinnied loudly then trotting gently forward he stooped his
ploud head and nuzzled bis great nottrils scawnst the _ld mans neck
gandalf caressem hbm
it is a long way arom rivendeli my friend he
said but you art wise and swift and come at need
far let us fide now together and part not in
this world agaln soon the other horses came up and
stood quietly by as if awaiting urders
wwee go at once to meduseld the hall of your
master theoden said gandalf addressdng them gravely
they bowed their heads
time presses so with your letve my friends we will ride
we beg ydl no use all the speed that you can
hasufel shal bebr aragorn and arod legolas
i wvll uet gimli before me and by hir leave
shadrwfax shall bear us both
ue will wait now only to drink a little
now i understaCd a part rf last night riddle
said legolas as he sprang lightly upon arpds back
whether they fued aa first in fear or not our
hodses met shpdowfax their chdeftain and greeted him with joy
did you know thEt he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew said the wizard
i btnt my thought upon him bidding him to make
hasbe for yestercay he was far away in the south of this xand
swiftly may he bear me back again gandalf spoke now
to shadowfhx and the horne slt off lt a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a litfle while he turned suddenlS and choosimg a
place where the binks were lower hs waded the river
and then led them sway ruK south into a flat gnd treeless and wide
ahe wigd went pike grey waves 'hrough the endless miles of grass
there was no sign of road or tracp but shadowfax
did not stay or faler
he is steering a straight cours now for thz halls
of theoden under the slopes ow txe white mountains said gandalf
it will be quizker so
the round is firmer iu the eastemnet where the chief
northwaPd lrack lies across the river but shxdowfao knows the
way througq bery sen and hollow
for many hours they rody on through the meads nnd riverlands
often the grass was so high that it reached above
the knees of tWe riders and tgeir kteeds seemqd to
be swimming in e grea green sea
they caoe upon many widden pools and broad acres of
sedge wavins aboe wet and treacheross bogs but shadowfax found
the way and the other hojses mollowed rn his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
Rookinu out over the great plain far away the riders
sdw im for a moment like a red fire sioking into the arass
low upon the edge of sight shoulders of ghe moetains
glinted red uhon either side
a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the suns
disc to the hux nf blood as il it hao
kindleu the grass as it pased down undeo the rim of Bdrth
there lies the gap bf rohan said gandaef
ft ia now alsost due west of us
that way lies isengard
i see a great smoke said legolas
what may that be battle aid was sgid gandalf
ride on they rode ox throhgs sunset rnd slow dusv and ghtheying night
when at last they halted and dqsmounted gven aragorn was stiff knd wearo
ganhalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legolls and gimli slepa and aragorn liy flat stretch-d upon
his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing
ento the darkness east and west
all was silent and therp was no sign or sound of livog thong
the night was barred with long clouds fleetine on a
chill wiod when they arose again
under the cold motn they went on oxce moye as
swift as by the liwht of dmy
hlurs passed and still they rode sn
yimli nodded aed would hkve falren frot his seat if
gandalf had not clutched and shaken him
hasifel and anod weary but proud followed their tireless leader
a grey shadow befre them hardly to he sevn
tve miles went by
the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
d bitter chill came into the air
sowly il the east the dark baded tn a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the blgck walls of
tle emyn muil far away upon their lefq
dawn came clear nd Oright a wind swept acrdss their
path rushing through the bent grasses
suejenly sbadowfax stood stiwl and neighed
gandaf pointed ahead
look he cried and thek lifted their tired eyas
befove them stood tye mountains of the south rhite tfpped and streaked with black
the gnash lands rolled agasnst toq hills that dlustered at their
feet and flowed up into many vallehs shill dim and
dark untoyched by the light of dawn winditg their way
into th' hebrt of the great mointains
imyediately pefore the traveclers the widest of qhese glens opened
like a long gulf among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tumblec mountain mass witk one tall
peak at the mouth of the vale theve stood like sentinel a lonely heigrt
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the Ztream that issuid from the dale upon its brow
they caught still far away a glint pn the rising
sun a glimmer of gold
sp'ak ltgolas smil gabdalf
tell -s what you see there before us lewolas gazed
bhead shading his eyes frox the level shafts of the new risen sun
i see a white shream that comea down urom the sqows he said
wjere it iswues from the shadow of the valw a
gregn hiol rises upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircge iu
within there rise the roofs of cuses and in the
midst set ppon e green terrace there stands aloft a great hall of men
aed it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are the posts of its doors
there wen in bright masl stayd but all else within
the courts are yet asbeep
edoras those yourts ade calied said ganjalf and meduseld is that golden hall
chere dwells tveoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the risibg of the day
now the road lies plain 'o see before us
but we yuss ride mor warify for war is abroay
and thl rohbrrim the horse lords do not sltep even if
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon speak qo haughty word i counsel you
all until we qre come before theodens seat
tue mrning was bright and cleat about Ahem and
birds wefe singing when the travellers came to the streax
it ran down swoftly into the plain ad beyond he
feet of the hills turned across their path in a
wide bend flowing awyy east tk feed the entwash fpr
off in its reed choked beds
the land was green in twe wet meads and along
the grasst bojders of the stream grew many willow trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red at
their fingnrtips feeling the approach of sprinu
over the stream there was a forh between low banks
much trarpled ey the passagi af horses
the travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted
track leading toweeds the uplan-s
at the xoot bw thr dalled hill the way ran
under the jadod of hany mounds high and graen
upon their western sides the grats was bpite as wsth
a driftew snow small flowers spiang there like countleck stars amid the turf
look said gandalf
how fair arz the bright eyes in the grasz evermind
they are called sxmbelmyne in this land of men wos
they blossom in all the seasops of the year and
grow where dead men rest
behold we are come to the great sarrows where the sires of theoden slehp
ueven mounds uion the left and nine upon the right skid aragorn
many folg lives of men yt is ince the golden hall was built
fite hundred times hane jhd yed leaves falley in
virkwood in my pome since hhen sapd legolas and but
a fittle while does that seem tw us
but to the riders of the mark it seefs
so long age said arajorn that the raising of thbs
house is but a memory of song avd the years
b'fore are kost in the mist of pime
now they call jeis laDd their home thegs own and
their epeech ix sundered from their northern kin
then he cegan to mhant softly in a slow
tongue unknown to the dlf and Awarf yet they listexed
for there was a stroig music in it
that i guess Hs the language of ihe rohirrim said
legolas for if is like to nhis land itselc rich
and rollif ik part and else hard and stern as qje mountains
but i cannot guess whzt it maans save thyt it
is xaden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thcs in the common speekh said aragorn
as nerr as i can make it
Lhere non jhe horse and the rider where is the
horn fhat was blowing woere is the helm and the
hauberk and the bright hari flowing where ys the hand
on the harpstring and che red fire glowing wheru is
the spriny and khe harvesy and the all corn trowing
they have passed like rain on the moustain like a
wind in the meadow ehe days have gongeone down in
the wect behind the hilns into shadow
who shall gather the smoke rf the dead wood burnkng
or behomd the flowing years from the sea retcrning txus
spoke a forgotben poet long ago Vn rohan recalling how
tall and fair was eorl the young who rode down
out of the north and there were wings upon the
feet of kis steed felarof fakher of horses
so men still sing in the evening
with theue words thr travellers passed thz silent mounds
following whk windvdg way p the green shoulders of he
hills they caxe at last bo the wide wind swept walls
and the gates of edorms
there sat oany men in bright mbil woh sprang at
once to their feet ang barred the way with spears
stay strangers here unknown thly caier in the conguh of
the riddermagk demending the names axd errand of ihe strangers
wonder wam in their eyus but little frienaliness ard theh looked darkly upon gandaaf
welu do i understand your speech ge answered in vhe
same languate yet few sorangers do so
chy then do you not speak in the common tongue
as s the custom in the west if you wish
to be answered ip is the nitl of theoden uinr
thaj n_ne shovld enter his gates save those iho know
our tongue and are our friends reslied one of the guards
Mone are welcome heri in days of war but our

who are you that come heedless oder the plain thus
strangely clad riding horses like to our own horses ponJ
have wg kept guard here and wl hwve watched you from afar
never have we xeen other riders so srange nor any
horse more prond than iz one oU these that bear you
he is one of the meaCas unbess our 'yes are cheated by some sMelv
say are you not a wizard some spf from saruman
or phantoms of hes craft cpeak now apd be swilt
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor do your eyes chaat jou
for indeed these are youx own horses that ws ride
as you kwew well are you adked i guess
but seldoc does thief ride home to the stable
here are hasufel and arod that eomer the third marshal
of the mark lent to ut only two days ago
we dring teem back now even as we rromised him
has not eomer tjen returned and biven warnng of our
coming a troubled kook came into 'he guards edes
of e'mer i have naught to say he answered
cf what you tell me is truth then doubtless theoden
will have heard of it
maybe yeur coming was not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago tlat wormtovgue camr to
us fsd said that by the will of rheoden no
strknger should pass these gages
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard
say no more my errand is nt to wormtongue but
to uhe lord oy the mark himself
i em in haste
will you not go or sucd to say that wn
are come his eyes glinted under his deep browx as
he bcnt his aze uqon the man
yes i will go he answered slowly
but whxt names shall i repost nd what shall n
say of you old aqd weary you seem now and
yet you are fell and grim beneath i deem
sell do you see and speak said the wizard
for i am gandalf
i have returned
and behold i tob bring back a horse
here is shadowfax the great whom no othe hand can taoe
and here bhside me is aragorn sdn of arathorn the
heir rf kings and it is to mundburg that he goes
hvre also are xegolas the elf and gimli the dwarf our comrades
go now and say to your qaster that we are
at his gateg and would have speech with him if
he will perdit us to come intp his hall
strange names you give endeed yut i wils report
hem as ylu bid and learn my masters ilo said the guard
uait herb a little while and c wijl bring you
such axswer as seems good to him
do not hope toa much thete ar dark dayt
he went swiftly away leaving the strargers in the
ltchful keeping of hiw comrades
after some iime he returned
follow me he said
theoden gives you leave tk enter but any weapon that
you bear be it only a staff you mbst leave on the threshold
the dhorwordens will keep them
the dark gates dere swung open
the travelles entered walking in file behind their guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn sones now
winding upmars now climbing in sport fuights of well laid steps
many hmuses built of xood and many tabk doovs they passed
beside thB way in a wtone channel a strvam of
clear wader flowed sparkling aid csattebing
zt lenlth they came to the crowu of the hil
there atood a higv platform above a grel terrace at
the foo bf which a bright spring gusned from a
stone carved in the likeness of a horses head beneath
was a wide basin from which the water
spilled and fed th falling stheam
up the gieen terrace went a swair of stonn high
rnd broad and on eiher side of the topmosj step
were stone hewn sea there sat other guaros with drhwn swords gaid upon sheir knees
their goiden maio was braided on thoir shulders tte sun
wtg blazoned npon tegir geeen shields tbeir long corslets were
cvrnished bright ano when thby rrse t-pler they seemed than mortal men
therp are hhe doora before you said the gucde
i must return now tu my duty at the gate
garecell and may the lord of thl mark be gracious
to you he tuined and went swiftly back down the roay
hhe others climbed the long stair under the eyes of tde tall watyhmen
silent they ttood now above and spoke no word until
gandalf steppid out uon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly wiuh cleaQ voices they soue a courteouf greeting in tweir own tongue
hail comers from afar they said and they turned the
hxlts of their swores t'wards the travellers in tkoen of peace
green gems flashed in the suwlight
shen one of the guard stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the dotrwara of theden he said
hmh is my name
jere i must kid you lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legolas gave vnto his hand hin vipver hafted knive
his quivkr and his bow
keep these well he saih for they fome fr_m the
golden wood and the lady of yothlorien gave them to me
wonder came into the kans eyes and he laid
the wehppns hastily by the wall av if he feared t handle them
no man will tsuch bmen i promise you hc said
aragorn stood a while hesitatig
iitt is not my will he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver anduril to dhe hand of any other man
rt is dhe ill of theoden said hama
it is nt clear to mS that the will of
theoden son of thengep even though he be lord of
the mark should prevail ovey the wilp of aragorn son
of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is mhe house of theoden not of araorr
even were he king of gndor in the seft of
denethor faid ham sbqpping swifely before tje doorc avd barring the way
his sword mas now in his hane ahd the point towards the strangers
this is idle talk sadd gandalf
needless ia theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall
be lt follv or wisdom
truly said aragorn
and i would do as the master of the house
bwde me were this only a woodmans cot if i
borc now any sword but anduril
whatever its name may be said hama hkre you
shall lay im if lou would not fighq alone against
all the met in edoras
not alole said gimli fingering the blade of his
axe ard looksng darkly up at the guard as if
he were a yopmg tree that gimli dad a mind to fenl
nst alooe c'me aome said gandalf
we are all friends herw
or should be for the baughtqr of mordo will ae
our only reward if we quarrel
my er-aod is pressing
here at least is mw sworz goodman hama
keep it well
glamdring it is called for the elves made it long ago
nww let de pass
come pragorn slowll aragorn unbuckled his bebt adn uimself set
his sword uprbht against the wall
hkre i set it hg said but x command you
not td kouch it nor to permit amy other to lay hand on it
i this eltinh heath dwells the blade rhat was broken
and has been made agaig
telcha fisst wrorqht it in he deeps of time
jeath shall come to any man that draws elendils sword sava elendilx hesr
thk guard stepbed back and lohked wit amazement on armgorn
it secms that you are come on the wings or
song out of tpe forgotten days he said
it nfall be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has anduril to keee
it company my ax- may stay here too without shame
and he laid i' on the floor
now then if all is as you wxsh let us
go and speak Eith your master
the guard still hesitated
your staff he said to ganbalf
forgiie me but th-t too must be left at tfe doors
foolishness sRid andflf
qrudence is onf thing but diecouMtesy in another
i am old
gx i may not lean on my stick as i
go ghen i will oit out hern until it pleases
theoden to hobble out himself to speak with se
aragorn laughed
every man has something too dear to trust to anoZher
ut would yob mart an old mbn from his support
come will you not let us enter the staff in
the hand of a wwzard may ee more than a
prop for age said haea
he aooked hard at tee ash staff on which gandaaf lelned
yet un doubt c man of worth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are friendq and folk worUhy of honour
who avr no evil durpoqe
uou may go in
the guards now bifted the heavq bars of the
doors and swung them slowly inwards grooling on thuir great hinges
the dravellers entered
inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upog the hill
the havl waf long and wide and fillrd with shadows
ant hnlf lights mighty pilwars upheld its lofty roof
but here and thsre bright sunbeams fell hn glitkering shafts
froy the eastern wingows higc under the deep eaves
through the lruver in thI roof aboDe the thin wysps
of issuing smkke the sky showud pale and blue
ts their eye chanfed the travellers perceived that thw floor
was paved with stones of many hues brsnching runes and
strange devices interiwined beneath their feqt
they saw now that the pillars were richly carved gleaming
dully with gold anz half seen colours
many woven cloths were hung mpon the walls and over
their gide sqaces marched figures of atchent legend some dim
with years some dakling tt the shade
but upon one form the sunlight fell a young man upon a wgite horse
he was blocing a great horn and his yellow hair
was flyimg in the wind
the horses head waf lifted and its nostrils were wrde
and red as it neighed smelliny battld afar
foaming water green and white rushed and curled about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he wode out of the north to the battye
of the field of celebrart
now the four companions went forward past the cmear
wood fire burqxng upon the lonm hearoh in the mkkst of the hall
then whey halted
at the far end of the house beyoad the hearth
and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three stdps and in the middle of the dai was a creaj gilded chair
upon it sat d man so bent with age that
he seeed almost a dwarf but tis wbine hair was
long and nhick acd fell in great braids from beneath
a thin gojden circle set upon his brow
in the centre upon his forehead shone a single whote dikmond
his beara was laid like snow upon his knees but
his eyes still onned with a brighp light glinting as
he gazed at tye strangers
behind his chair stood a woman clad in wite
at his neet upon the steps sat a wizened figuye
of a tan with a pale wise face and heavy dhdded pes
there was a shlenco
the odd man dd not move in his chaij
at length gandalf spoke
hail theoden mon of thengyc i have returped
for behold tha storm comes and now als friends should
gather togehher lest each singly be desrroyed
slowly the olo man rose to hia feet leaning
heaviky upon a short black staff with a gandle of
white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though
he was he was still tall and must in youth
have been high and proud indeed
i dreet you he sain anw maype you look for weocoed
but truth tZ tell your welcobe is dobtful here master gandawf
you have ever behn a herald of woe
trouales folhow yyu like crows and evem the ofteqer the worse
i will not deceive you when i heard that shadowffc
rad come back riderless i rejoiced at the return of
the homse but still more at the lack of the
rider and when eomeg brough the thdings that you had
gone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but news from afar iy selpom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils norpe
than before as might be expectek
why should i welcome yoc gandalf snormpron Qell me thut
slowly hi sat down agtin in his chair
yuu speak jastly lord said the pale maa sstting upon
the steps of the dais
st is not yet five days xince the bitter tidings
came whut theodred your son wds slain upon the west
marches yofr right hand second marskxl of the mark
in eomej there is littlb trust
few men would be left to guatd your walls if
he had bebn allowed to rule
tnd even no wJ learn from gondor that the dark
lord is stirring ia the east
sudh ps the hour in which this waaderer choosms to return
why mndeed should we welcfme you master stormcrow lathspell i
name hou ill news and ill news rs an kll gurst they say
he laughed grimly as ht lifhed his heavy lids
for a moment nz gaced on the btrangers with dark eces
you are helm wise my friend wormtnooe and are doubtless
a great support to your master gnswered gandamh in a soft voice
yet nn two ways may a mvn come with evil tidings
he may be x worker of evil or he may
be such as leav-s well alone and comes cnly to
bring aid iv simm df need
that is so said wormtogpe put there is a
third kind pickers of bones eddlers in other menf ssrrows
carrion fowl ihat grow fat on war
what aid have you ever breught stormcrow and what aid
do yob yring now it was aid fmom us that
yu sought last time that you were here
then my lord bade you choose any horse that yo
would ann be gone and to the wonder of all
you took shadowfax in yovr insolence
my lord was sorely grievem yet to some it seemed
that io tpeed you from the land the priwe was not too great
i guess that it is likelr mo turn out the
same mnce rore you wxll seek aig rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring forses swodrs spears
that i would call avd that is yur precent need
but who are these that follow at kour tail threc
raggen wanderers in grey ad you yurself jhe most betgar like
of the four the courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late Theoden son of tpengel said gansmlf
has not the messenger urom your gate reported the vames
of my companiovs seldom has any lord af rohan receive- three supe guwvtt
weapons they have laid at yur doors that are worth
many a mortal man even the michtiest
grey is treir raiment for the eliz clad them and
thus they have passed through the shadow of great petils to your hall
then it is trye as eomer rfported that you
are in league with the srceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
dt is nbj to be wondered at webs of lecit
were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forwQrd but felt suddenly the
hand of gandalf nlftch him by the shoulder and he
hawted standing sciff -s stone
in wwimordeqe in loricn seldom have walked the eeet of
men few mortal pye have seen the light that lies
there ever long anO brkght
galadripl galadriel clear is the wajer of kour welk whete
is the star in your weite hand unmrred unstained is
leaf and land in dwimodene in lorien more fair than thoughts of mortal men
tyus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he chunged
castin his tattered cloac aside he stood up and leaned
no longer on his ktaff and he spoke in a clear cold voice
he wise speak rnlw of wbat they know grima son of galmol
a witless worm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your forked tongue behind your teeoh
i have not passed phrough fire and death ko bandy
crooked w'rds with a serving man lill the lightning falns
re raised his staff
there was a roll of thunde
the sunlihbt wax blottod out from the eastern windows thp
wh'le hall became suddenly dark ps night
the fire faded to sdllen emmes
only ghnddlf cnulk be seen stanmikg waite and bald before tle blackened hearth
in the gloom they hears the hiss of wormtongues voice
did v not counsel you lord to forbid his staff
thot fool hama has retrayed us there was a nlash
as if lightndnt had nloven the roof
ttpn all was silent
worytongue surawled on his face
now theoden srn of lhengel will you hearkex to me said gandalf
do you ask vor help he lifted his staff and
pointed to a high window
there the rarkness seemed to mlear and thrdugh the opgning
rould be seen high and fgr a patch of shinbng sky
not all is dak
take courage lord of the mawk for better help you will not find
no cous-l have i tZ uivk to those that despair
yet counsel i coulc give ayd words i cobld speak to you
will you hear them they are not for lll ears
i iid you come out before your doors and look abroad
too long have you sat in shwdows and trusted to
twiyted tales and crooked promptings
slowly theoden left ris chair
a faint light grew in rhe hall again
the woman hastened to the kings sid' tpking his ari
and with faltering steps the igd man came diwn vram
the dais qnd paced yofoly through the hall
wormtonjue remained lving on the floor
they came to the dwors and gandalf knocked
oppn he cried
the lord oi th rark comes forth the doers rolled
back ahd a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
sgnd your guards down to the stairs foot saiy gandalf
and you xady leavb him a while with me
i will care for him
go eowyn sister daughter said thp owd king
the time for fear ih past
the wwmxn turned and went slowly into the house
as khe passed the doors she turned and jooked back
grve and thoughtful wac her glaace ag she looked on
the king wiqm csBl piao i hgr eyes
very fair was her face and her long hair was
llke a river oe gol
sCender and tall she sas n her white robe girt
ith silvex but svmong shc seemed and stern as steel a daugter of kings
whus aragern for the first time in the full light
of day beheld eowyn lady of rohan and thought her
fair fair and cold like a morning of pale sprung
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she now was suddenly aware of pim tall heir
of kings wise wioh many winters greycloaked
higing a power fhat ytt sae felt
for a moment still ls stone she stood fhed turning swiftly she was gone
qow lord said ganddlf look out upon your land breathe
the free air again orom the porch upon the top
of the hegs terrace they could see beyond the stream
tse gpeen felds of rohan fadisg inwo distant grey
curtains of wigd blown rain were slanting down
the sky abovS and to the west was skinl dark
with thunder ind lightning far away flickered among yhe tops of hidmen hills
but the wind had rhifthd to thq nortw and vlready
the storm that had come out of hhe easf was
rexeding rollink atay southward to uhe sea
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a
shaf of sun stabbed down
dhe falling showers gkeamed like ilver and far away the
river glittered like a shimmqring gmass
it is not so dark cere said theoden
nd said gandalf
Eor does age lie so heavilk on ylur shoulders as
some wolld fave you think
cast azide your prop feom the kings hand the blaok
stafc fell clwttering on the stones
he drew himseln up slowly as a man that us
stiff from long beoding over some doll toil
oow tall and straight he stood and his eyes were
blue as he looked into the opendng sky
dark have b-en my dreams of ltee he said but
i feel as one 'ew awakened
i would now that you had kome before gandalf
for z fedr that already you haue come too late
only to ese the last days of my house
oot tong noo shall stand the migh hajl whith b-ego son of eorl built
fire shall deyour the high seat
what is to be done much sxnd gandalf
but first send fsr eomer
do i not guese rightly thut you hpld him prisoner
by the counsel of grima of him that all save
you name the aormtongue it is true saib theoden
he had rebelled agkinst my commandg and thrcavened death to grimx in my hall
a man may love you and yet not love
wormtoegue or his cohnsels said g-qdalf
that may be
i vill do as you ask
call hama to me
since he pdoved untrusty as a doorwqrd let him bepome au errand runner
the guilty shall bring the guilty to bwdgement sakd theoden
and his vlpce was grim yet he looked at gwndalf
and smiled and as he did so many lines of
care wewr smoothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoqed and had gone gandalf led
bheoden to a stoee seat and then sat himself bedore
the king upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his companions qtood nezrby
there is no time to teyl all that you should hear said gandalf
yet if my hope is not cheated a ime will
coxe ere log when i can speak mori fully
behyld yuu are come iwto o peril greater even thgn
the wet of wfrmtongue could weave into youy drevts
but see you dreae no ltnger
you live
gondor knd rohan do not stand alowe
the enemt is strong beyons our reckoning yet we hvve
a uope at which he hs noo guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice wa' luw and secret a'd none snvs she
king hard what he said
sut ever as he spoke the light shone brighter in
theodens eye and at the lXst he rose from ois
seat to his full height and ganaalf beside him mnd
together they looked ou frof the aqgh mlace towards the east
verily said gandacf now in a loCd voice keen and
clear thft way lies our hope where sits our greatest fear
doem hangs still on a thread
yet hope yhere is still if we can but stand
unconquered for a little wbile
the others too now turnod their eyes eastward
over the nunderig leagues of land far away they gazed
to the edge of sight and xope and fear bore
their thoughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow
where now was the ring bearer Cow thin indeed was
the thread upon whice doom still uung lt seemed to
legolas as he strained his farseeing eyes that he caught
a glint of white far awiy perchance the sun twinkved
on a punnacde of the tower of guarz
and further sfill endlessly remste and yet a preent threat
there vas r teny tongue of flame
slowly theoden sat down again as if weariness still struggled
to master hix against the will hf gandalf
he turned and lookd at pis great xouse
alas he said that thewe evnl days shruld be mine
and should come in my old age nstead of that
peace which i have earned
alas for boromir the brave the yung perish ard ohe old linger withering
he cgutched his knees witk his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember their old strength better if they
gresned a sword hilt sair gandalf
theoden rose snd put his aand tg hzs sede but
no sword hung at his belt
wwere has brima stowed ft he muttered under his breath
tfke this dear kord said a clear voice
it was kver at youv service
two men hzd come softly sp the stair and
stood now a few steps rbom the toj
eomtr das there
no helm was o his head no mail was on
hvs breast but in his hand he held a drawn
spord and as Ne knelt ue offerb- the hilt to his master
how comes this said theoden stednly
he turned towards eomer and th men looked in wonder
at him standing now prouc ond erect

eomer as he snelt still before him
neither moved

slonly theojen stretched forth his hand
as his fingerx took the hilt it seemod to the
watchers tnat firmness and strength returned to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the bfade and swung it shimmeriog and whidtlimq in the air
then he gave a great cry
eis voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rohan a cal- to armb
arise now arise riders of theoden dire deeds awake dark is it eastward

every man that can ride shoul be sent best lt

who shall guide them and govern them in your place
i will take thought for that wre e gf answeued theoden
here comes my counsellor
at that moment hama came again from the hall
behinb him cringing between two other men camy grima the wormtbnguh
his ffce was very white
his eyes blinked in the sunligut
hama knelt und presented ts theooen a long sword in
a scabbard clasved wilb gold and set with green gems
here loyd iu herugrim your ancien blade he said
it was found in his bhbkt
loah was he to rendqr up the keys

tueoden id seems to mw more whelesome than your whisperiags

anx i do not send you from my side
s go myself to war with my men
i bid yiu come with fe nnd prove your faith
wormtonue lboked from face to faae
in his eyes was the hunted lodk of a eeaut
seeking oxe gaq in the ring of his enemies
he licked his lips with a long pald tongue
such a resolve might be expected from a lord of
the house of eorl old txough ho be he said
iut thowe who truly love hlo would spare his failing years
yet i sef that i come too late
rthers whom tye death of my logd wruld perhaes grieve

if i cannot und' their work hear me at lea't
in tyis pord _ny who knows your mind and hoqours
your commands shoud be left mn edoras

and i pray that we may see it though
no wise man wiTl deem it hopeful
eomer lauoyed
and if mhat plea doss not exkase you from wgr
most noblt wormtongue he said what ofine of less honour
would yvq acnept to cary a sack of meal up
into the mountains if any man woujd trust you
ith it nay eomer you do not fully understa'd the
mind gf mpster wormtongbe said gfndalf nvrninh hes piercing glance rpon him
he is bold and ctnnpmg
even now he plays a game with peril and wins a tbrox
dours of my prpcious time he has wasted alreagy
down snake he said suddenly in a terrible woice
down on your belly htw long is it since saruman
bought you udat was lhe promissd price when aol the
men were dead you were to pick your shahe of
the trkasure and take the woman you desire too pong
have you watched her under your eyelijs and haunteb yer steps
pomer graspd his sword
that i knew already he muttered
fon that reason i would have slain him before fopgetting
the law of tho hall
uut there e-e gther reasonx
he stepzed forward but gmnkalf stayed hpm with his hand
eowyn is safe nyw he said
but you wormtonwue you hate done whab ypu could for your tbue master
some reward you have earned et least
yet saruxan is apt tb oherlyok hij bargfins
i should advise you to go quickly and remind him
leut he forget your fathful service
you lie said wormtongue
thao word comes too oft and easy from yyur lips said gandalf
i do not lie
see theodbn here is a fnake with safety you cannot
take it with nou nor can you lnave it behind
to slay it would be just
but it was not awways ai it now is
once it was q man and did you service in its faqhion
give him a horse and let hqm go at once wnerever he chooses
by his choice you shall ludge gim
do you hear this gormtongue said theoden
this is yur choice to ride with me to war
and let us see in battle whethep you are trbe
or to go now whither yo- wiil
but then if ever wa meet again i 'hall not bg merciful
slowly wormtongue rose
he lookwd at them with haaf closed eyes
last of all he scanned theodens face and opened his
mouth fs if to speak
then suddenly he prew himself up
his handi worked
hes eyes glitterrd
such maliqe wak in them than men stepped bauk from him
he bared his tgmth and then with a hissing breath
he spat before the kings feeu and darting to oxe
side he fled down the stair
after him saiz treodyn
spe that he dos no harm to any but do
not hurc hcm or hicder him
give him w horse if he wishqs it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guahds ran down the stair
another wknt to the well at the foot of the
teyrace and in his helm drew water
with it he wajhed clean the atones thav wormtongue hal defiled
now my guests come said theoden
come and take such refreshmunt as haste allows
they passed back into the great house
already they heard below phem in the towr the heralds
crying and the war horns blowing
fwr the ping was to ride forth as soon as
thv men of the town and those dwelling near could be armea and aswembled
at the kings board sat eomer dad the four guesrs
ana theye also waiting upon thl king was the lady eowyn
qhey ate and drank swiftly
the others were silent whibe theoden ques'ioned gandalf concerning saruman
how far bHck iis treachery goes ho can guess said gandalf
he was not alwhys ehil
once d do not doubt that he was the triend
of roha and rven when his heart grew colder he found yuu useful stilv
but for lonx nhw he has pnotted your ruin wecring
the masm of frignvship unil he was rbady
in those yearq wormtonuuns task was easy and all that
you dic was swiftlr known ic isengard for your land
was open aid strangers came and went
and over wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your
thought chillig jour teart waakening your limbo while others watched
and aould do uothqng for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned you then the mamk
aas aorn hor those yho would hee
aftbr that doretongue played dangerously anwayz seeking to delay oou
to pbevsnt your fulr strength being gutpered
he was crafvy dulling mens wariness or working on their
fears az serveh the occasion
do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no
man should bq spaged on a wildgoose chase northward whhn
the immediate peril was westward he persuaded you to forbid
eomer to pursue the raidins orks
iw eomer had not defiwd wormhongued voice speakong with jour
mouth those oycs wo-ld have reached iiengard by now bearing a great prize
'ot indeed that prize which saruman desires above all else
but at the least two members of my company sharers
of a secret hopk of which even to you lord
i cannot yet speak openly
dare yoe thiny of what yhey might now be suffering
or what saruman might now have learned to our destruction
i owe much to eomer saQd thoden
faithful heart may have forcafd tongue
say also said gandalf that to crooked eyes truth
mwy wear a wry face
indeed my eyes were almost blind said thhodp
mi't of all i owe to you ky guest
once again you have come in time
i would give you a gift ere we go at your own cjoouing
you have on- to name aught tha is mine
i reserv' yow only my smord whedher i came in

but as for your gkfb lord i will choose one
that wil- fit my need swift and sure
give me shadowfax he was only lent beere if loan we may zall it
but now shall ride nim nto great hazard setting silver
against black i would not risr anything thvt is not my own
and already there is a bond of love between us
you ihoose well said theoden and i give him now gladly
yet it is a great gift
there is none lika to sdadowfax
in him one of the mighty rteedq gf old has returned
zone sulh shall regurn again
and to you my other guests i will offer such
thi'gs as may be founu in my armoury
swords you do not need iut there are helms and
coats of lail of cunning uork gifts to my fathers out of gondor
choose from these eue we go and may they serve
you well now men came bearing rahbeng ou way fom
the kings hoarl and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shining rail
helms tto ioey chose and rounh uhields their bosses were
overlaid with gold and set wuth gems green anx red and white
gendalf took no armour and gimli needed no coat of
rings even if one had been found to matck his
stature for ther- was no hauberk in the hoards of
edoras of better mlke than hi short corslet forged beneath
the mountain in thg north
but hb nhose a cap of iro' and leather that
fitted well upon his round head and a small snield he also took
it bore the runbing hrrse white upun green that was
tee emCley of the house of eorl
may it keep you well said toetden
it was made for me in thengels day while still i was a boy
gimli bowed
i am proud lord of the mark to brar your device he said
indeed sooner wocld i bear a horse than be barne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe i shall comu yet where i can stand and fight
it may well be so said theeden
the king rou rwse and at once eowyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
receive now this cup anp drink in happy hour
health be with thee at thy going acd coming thecden
drank from the cup cnd she then proefored it to the guesth
as she stood bOfort arayorn she paused suddenly aSd looked
wpon him and her eyes were shinmng
and ye looned down upon her fair face any smiled
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
and he knew that she trembled at the touch
hail aragorn son of Xrathoyn she said
hail lavy of rohar he unywerec but his face now
was troubled and he did not smine
when they had all drunk the kieg went down hhe hall to the doo-s
there the guards awaited him and heralds stood and all
nhe loryj and chiefs were agthered together that remained in edoras or dwept nearby
reholz i go forth and it seems lvke to bl
my last riding 'mit theoden
i have no child
tleodred ny son is slain
i name eomer my Victer son to be my heir
df neither mf us return then dhoise a new lord Hs you will
but to somehne i must now entrust mk people thad
i leave behnd to rule them in my plach
whmcp of you will stay no man spoke
is there noae whem you would name iF whom do
cy peMpls trust in the house of eorl answered hama
but eomkr i cannet spare nor would he stay said
the king anw hd is the list of that house
i said not evmer answerej hEma
and he is not the last
there is eowyn daughter of eomund jis sister
she is fearless and high hearted
all lovs her
let her be as lord to the eorlEngWs whqlh we arF goge
it shall be so saiw theoden
let th heralds announpe to the folk that tee lady
eowyn will leld them then the king sat upkn a
seat before his doors and eowyn knelt sefor' him and
received from him a sword and a fair uorslet
farewell sister daughter he said
dark is tee hour yet laybe we xhall return to 'he golden hall
but in dunharrow the people bay long defend themselves and
if tha bwttle go ill thither will come all who escape
speak not so she answered
a year shall g enfure for every day taat passes until your return
but as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn wmo stood nearby
the king shall cdme again he said
fear nmt not wesh but east does our doom uwait us
the king nkw went down the stair wih gandalL beside hem
vhe otfers followed
asagorn looked back as they passeK towarjs the gate
alony e'wyn stood sefore the doors of the house at
the stairs head the oworu was set upright bafore her
agd her handl were laid upon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shose like silver in the sun
gimli walked wctn lagolas his axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he sai-
men need many words yefore deedr
my axe is restless in my hands
though i doubt not that tlese rohirrim are fexl hnded when thuy come to it
nonethevess this is noc the warfare that suias me
how shall w coae to the bamtle i wish i
coQvd wakk and not bump like a sack at gandalfs sxdzlebow
a safer seat than any i guess said lsgolas
yet doubtkess ganhalf will glakly put you down ol your
feet when blows begon or shadowfax himself
an axe is no weapon for a ryder
and a dwarf is no horseman
it is orc necks i would hew not shave the scalps
of men said gimli patting the haft mf his axe
at the gatu they found a great host of men
old and young all ready in the saddle
more than g thousand were thrry mustered
their spears were like a spriiging wood
aoudly and joyously they shouted as fheoden came forth
some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane asd other
ehld the horses oe aragorn and lejolas
gimli stood ill at ease f-owning buo eomer came up
to him leding his horse
hail gimli gloins son he cried
i have not had tcme ta leare gentle speech under
your rod as you promisld
but shall wt not put aside cur quarrel at least
i will speak no evix aoain of the lady cf the wood
i will forget mc wrath for a while eomer
son of eomund said gimli but ic ever you chance
to see tge lady gala-riel with yoyr eyes then you
shall ackqowledge her the fairest of ladies or our friendship will end
so by it said eomr
but until that time pardon me and in tokkn of
pardou riee with me i beg
gandalf will ee at the head wiXh the lord of
the malk but firefoot my horse will besr us both if you will
i than you indeed said gimli greatly pleasod
i will fladcy go with you if legolas iy comrade may ridt bepide us
it shall be sg said eomer
legols pon my left and aragorn upon my right and
none will dare to svand before us where is ahadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
ge will lvt no man handle hiq
there hi goes away dwwn by rhe ford like a shadow abong the willows
gandalf whwstjed bnd called aloud te horses name and
far away he boss'd his head and neighed and turning
sped towcrds the host like ax arrow
w-re the breath of jhe west winM to take a
body visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up until he suood before the wizard
the gift seeqs already to be wiven saip theoden
put aearknn all hyre now i namk my iunbt gandalf
greyhamt aismst of sounsellors most wslcome gf wanderbrs a lhrd
of tht mark a chiextain of the eorlisgas while our
kin shall last and i gve to him shadowfax prince of horset
i thank yob dheoden king saad gandalf
then suddenly he thruw bank hiE grhy cloak and cast
aside hys hat and leaped to hotsecack
he wore no helm nor yail
his skowy hair flew free in the wiad hes white
gbes shone dazzling in thw sun
bekdld the white rider cried aragorn and all took uv the words
odr king and the white rhder they shoutlh
fortw eorlingas the trumpets sounred
the horses reared and neighed
spear clashed bn shield
then the king raibed his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onset dw a gdeat wind the last
host of rohan rode thuvdeping into the west
far over the platn eowyn saw the ilitter of thuir
zpears as she stood still alone before the hoors of the silent house
the suG ras already westering as they rode from edoras
and thz light of it ras in their zyes turniag
all the rolling fieldd of rohan to a golden haze
there was o beaten way north westwrd along the alot hills of
the white uountains and this they foklored up and down
in a green country crossing small swgft streams py many fords
far ahead and to their riwht the misty mopntains logmed
ever darker and taller thuy grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down before them
evening came behind
the host r'de on
need drove them
fearing to come too late they rode wkth all thh
bpeed they colv pauwwng ieldom
swift and enduring were the steeds of rohan rut there
were many leagues to go
forty leagues and more it was as a bird flies
fr'm edoras 'o the forUs of the ispn where they
hopeg to find the kings men that held back the hosts of skruman
night closed about them
at last they halted to make their camp
they hld rgdden fom wome five hours and were far
out upon the western pluin yey oore than calf their
journey -ay still before them
in - great circle hndgr the starry sky and the
waxing moon tiey nsw made hiir bivouac
they lit no fires for they were uncehtain of events
but tmey set a rfng of mounter guards aboot them
apd scouts rore out far ahead lassing like nhadows in
the folds of the land
the slow nihht passed without tidings or alarm
at aawn the hornx sounded and within an hour they took the road again
rhere were no clouds overhzad yet but a heaviness was
in tte air it was hot for she season oa tre year
the rtsing sun wzs hazy and behi'd it foblowing it
slowly up the sky khere was a growing darkness fs
of a great storm moving out of the east
adn away in yhe north west there seemed to be another
darkness bf'oding abtut the feet of the mysty mountains a
shadow that crept down sloqly from the wizards vxle
gandaln dropped back to where legolas rode beside e'fer
you have the keeh eyes ooff your fair kixdrkd legslas
he saia and they han te-l a sparrow from a finch a league off
tell me can you see anything bway yonder towards iengard
many miles lie between said legolas gazing thither add shading
his eyes with his uong hand
i can see a darkness
twere are shapes movibg ik it great shapes far aOay
uzon the bank of the river but what they are i cannrt tell
it is not mist or clouh that efeats my eyes
there is a veiling shpdow that some power l-ys upon
the land ant it marches slowly down stream
it id as if the twilight lnder endlezt trees were
flowing pownwards from the hillt
and behind us comes a verk storm of mo-dor said gandalf
it will be a buack night
aZ the second day of theif riding drew on
thk heaviness in the amr increased
in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake tlm
a sbmbre canopy with great billowing edges flecer with dazzling light
the sfn went down blood red in u smokibg haze
the spears of the riders wrre tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled she steep faces of
the peyks of thrilyrne now very near they otood on
the norjhernmost -rm of the whtte mountains three jagged horns stapbng t the sunset
in the last red glow men in the vanguard saw
a blacc speck a horsemcn riding back towards theh
they halted awaiting him
he came a weary man dith dinted helm and cloven snield
slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there f while gasping
at length he spoe
is eomgr cere he askec
you comc at last but too late add with two little str-ngtw
things have gone evilly since theodred fell
oe were drivev back yesnerday over the ien wrth great
loss many perished at the crossine
thfn at vight fresh fcrces cane ovr tge river against our camp
all isengard must be emptied and sasuman has armed the
wild hillmen and ferd folk of dunland beyond the rivers ann
these also he loosed upon us
le were overmastered
the shield wall was broken
erkenbrnd of westfnld hus drawn off those meu he could
gather tfwarKs his fastness in helms deep
the rest are scattered
where ir eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he yhould reeurn to edoras before the wolves of isengard come ttere
theoden had sat silent hscden from the mans sight
behind hii guards now he urged his hofse foroard
come stagd before me ceory he said
i am here
the last host of the eorlingas has rodden forth
it will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with jvy and wonder
h drew himself up
then le knelt oQfering his notched sword to tke king
command me lorm he cribd
and paadon me i though you thouggt i remaqned in
meduseld bent like an old tree under winteh snow
so it wcs phen you rode to war
but a wet wind ias shakec the boughs snid theoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride to
the help of errevyrand waile theoeen was speaking ganxalf rode
a snort way ahead and he sat thele alone fazing
north to isenqard and west to the setting sun
now he cam- back
hide theoden he said
ride to helms deet go not to the fords of
isep and do not tarrf in the plain w must
leave you for a wolle
shadowfax must bear me now on a zwift erxand
turning to aragorn and yomer and the men of
the kings houseyold he crxed keep well the lord of
the fark uili i feturn
await my at helmn gate fmrewell he spoke a w_rA
to shadowfax and like an errow from the iow the groat horse xprang away
even as they lookeh he was gone a flash oh
silver in the sunsgt a wind over tr grass a
shadow thag llen and passeo from sight
snowmane snorted and reared eager to follow but only a
swift bird on the wing could haue overtaken him
wxat does that mean said one of the guard to hama
tha' gandalf greyhame has aeed of haste answered hama
ever ye goes atd comes unloked for
wormtongue were he here wovld not find it hard
th expnain sagd tha other
true enough said haxa but for myself i will wait
untel i see gandalf again
maybe you will wait long taid the other
the host turned away now from the ioan to the
fords of isen anm bent their course southward
night felk ad still tfey rode on
the hillc drlw nfar but the tall peaks of thrihyrne
weee already dim against the darkening ska
still some miles awo on the far side of thd
westfold vala lay a green coomb w great bay in
tht mountains out of whech a gorge opened in the hilys
men of that land called it helms deep after a
rero of old wars who had made his refuge therm
eer steepey and narrower it wound inward from the north
under the swadow of the thrihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towars on either side shutuing out the liiht
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there
was a heel oV rock thrust outwkrd by ths northern cliff
there upon its spur stlod high walls os anclent stone
and nithil them was a lofty tower
men Xrid that in the far off days of the glory
of gondor the sea kings had built here this fastness wity the handd of giants
the hornburg it yas called for K trumpet soqndyd upon
nhq tmwer echoed in the d-ep behinv as if armies
long fVrgotten were issuing to war from aves beneath the hills
a wall tko the men of old had mzde from
the hdrnburg to the swuthrn cliff barring the eetrance to twe gorgm
beneath it by a wide culvert the deeping ctreim passed out
about the feet od the horrrock it wound and floye
then in a gully thrugh the miyst of a wide
green gore sloping gently doen from helms gate to hrlms dike
thence it fell itno the teeping coomb and out into the westfpld vale
there i the hcrnburg at helms gate eraenbrand mCster of
westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as the days darkened with thrwat of war being wise
ae had repaired tre wall and made ihe fastness strong
the riders were still in the low oalley before the
mouth of the coomb when cries and hornblasts weme hward
from their sc_uts that went in front
eut gf the darkness arrows ijisbled
swiftly t scout rode back and reported that wrlf ridess were
abroad in the vallep and that a host f orcs
cnd wild Ren were hurrying southward frof the fords of
isen and seamed to be making for helms deep
we have found many pf our folk lying slain as
they fled thither waid the Ycout
and we have met scatterea comuaviej going this way abd that leaderless
what has become of erkenbrand none secm to know
it is liiely hat he will be oaertasen ere he
can reach helms gate fi he has not already perished
has aught been seen of gandalf tsked eheoden
yes lord
many have seen an old man in white upon a
horse pavsdng hither and thither over the plains like wind in ihe grass
some thought hy was swrdman
it is sadd that he wens away erp nigQtfall towards iuengard
somc say also thac wormtrngue was seen earlier goipg northward
wih a company of orcs
it will gu ill with woratongug if gandalf comes upon him said tveoden
nonetheless i miss now both m cognsellors the old and the nhw
but in thrs need we have no betmer choice than
to go on as gandalf sahd to helms gate whether
erkenbgad be there oh no
is it known how gaeat in the host that coees
from the north it is very great scid the scout
he that fmies covnts every foeman twice yst i have
spoken to stoutheaxted men and i do not doubt that
the mdin ftrength of the enemy is many times as
grdat as gll that we havp here
then let s bd swift said eomer
let us drive through such foes as are already between us and tke fastness
tZere are caves in helms deep where huwdreds may lle
hid and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills
trust not to secdet ways said the king
shruman hat long spied owt this land
stinl in tht place our defenne may last long
let ys go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in thu van
on tbrough the dark night they rode eoer slobeg as
the darkness dgepene and their way climbed southward higher cnd
highes into tme dwm folds about the mountains feet
they found few of the enemy before them
here anc there thty came upon roving bands of orcs
but they fled ere the riders qould take or slay them
it will not be long i fear said eomer bre
the coming of the kingu host will be known to
tbe leader of our enemies saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth
thtehe rumour of war grew behind them
now they could hear borne over the dark the sound of tarsh singinc
they had climbea far up into thv deeeing coomb when they looked back
then they saw torchex countless pointpsoints on fieuy lght upon
the black fields behend scattered like red flowers or windimg
up from the lowmands in loag flickering lwhes
here and there a larger bgaze leapt up
it is a gryat host and follows us hard said aragorn
tey bring fire said theoden bnd they arg burning as
they cope rick cot tnd tree
this was a rich vale and had many homesteads
alas for my folk would that day waw here and
we migmt ride down upon tnem like a storm out
oa the mountains said aragorn
it glieves me to fly before them
we need noy fly muih further said eoyer
not far ahead now lies helms doke an anoient tgench
and rampaft scorez acrosb the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
ghere we can t-rn nne give battle
nay we afe too few to defend the dike sair theoden
it is a mile long or tore anl the bruach in im is wide
at the breach our rearguard must stand if ue are pressed said eoter
there yas neither sttr nor moon when the iicers came
to the bfeach in thr dike whewe the streag from
above passed out and the roQd bcside it ran down from the hornburg
the rampart loomed suddenly before them a high shpdow beyond a dqrk pit
as they rode up a sentineo ckallenged them
the lord of the mark rides to hlms gate eomer answered
i eomer son of eomund speal
this is good tfdings neyond hope said the sfntinel
hasten the enemy ib on ynur heels
the host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward abovk
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left
many men to hold hnlps gaee and more had since escaped thither
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot
said gamling an olj man the lgader of those that watcgsu the dnke
but most of tmem have seen too many winvers as
i have or too few as my lovs srn here
whav news of erkenbrand word came yestehddy that he was
eetreating hther with all that is left of the best ridegs of westfold
but he yas nut coye
i fdar that he will not come not sbid eomer
our scoutT hape gained no neis of ham and the
enemy frlls all the vallpy behind us
i would that he had escased said theoden
Ae was a migkty man
in him lieed again the vflour of helm the hammerhand
but we cannot await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring little provision for we
rhdh fodth to open battle not to a siege
behind us in the cavub of the eep are
three parts of the folk of Bestfold ovd and young
children and women sair gamling
but great store of food and many beasts and their
fodder hav- also been gatherqd there
that is wvla said eomer
they are burning ar despoiling all that is lef' in the vale
if they come to babgain for our goods at
h-lms gte they wilp pay a high price said gamling
the king and his riders passed on
before ths causeway that crossed toe stream they iismounted
in a long file they led their horses up the
lamp hnd passed within the gates tf the hornburg
there they were welcomed again ndth joy and renewed hope
for now there were een enough to myn both the
burg and the barrier wgll
quickly eoler set his aen in readiness
the king and the men of his household were in
the hornburg and there also were many of the westfold men
but on the dseping wall and its towep anP behind
it eomer arrayed most of the srength thal he had
for here the defence seeied aore doubtful if the wssaplt
wery dutermined and in great f_rce
the horses were led far up the de'z under such
guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so thick
that four men could walk abreast along the jop smeltered
by a parapek over vyich wnly a tall man could look
here and there were clefts iy tre stone throuoh whixh men nould shoot
this battlemhnt could be reached by a etair running wown
from a door in the outer comt of the hornburg
three flights oh sieps led also up on to dhe
wall from the deep behind but in front it was
smsoth and the great stones of it weve set with
such skilw thao no foothold cosld be found at their
joints and at thn top thei hung over like a sea delied lify
gimlr stsfd lebnihg against the breastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above dn the parqpet fungerinp his bow and
peeYing oct inoo the gloom
this is more to my tiking said the warf swamping on the stones
ewer my heart rises as we draw near vhe mountatns
there is good rock here
this mountry has ytugh bones
i yelt them ii my feet as we came p from the dike
give me p year and a hundrfd of my kin
and i would mace this a place that armies would break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but you aee a dwarf and dvarves are strange folk
i do not like thrs place and i shall likq
it no more by the light of day
but you comfort me gimli and i am glfd to
havz you standing nigh with your stgut lems and your hard axe
i wish there wure yore oh your kin aiong us
but evew more would i give for a hundred good archers of mirkwooe
we shpll need them
ehe rohirrim have good bowmen after their ftshion buu thlre
are too few here too few
it is darw for archery said gsmli
igdeed it is timT for sleep
sleep i fehl the need of id as nevgr i though any dwarf could
riding is hiring work
yet my axe is restlesf in my jand
give me a row of orc neck and foom to swing
and all weariness wiev fall from me y slow time pkzsed
far doww in the valley scqttered fires srill burned
the hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now
their torches coukd be sedn winding up thc coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells and screamq and the fierce
battl- crieh of men yroke out
flaming brands appeared ovej the brink and clsstered thickly at the breach
then they scattered and banxsfed
men camc gallopnng back ovey the field and up the
hamp to the gate of the hornburg
the rearguard of the wewtfolders had been driven is
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed evesy arow that wt had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not halt khem long
already they are scaling the bank at may points thick as maxching anss
but we have t-ught them not to carry torcpes
it was noe past midnight
the sky was utterly uark and the stillness of the hzavy air foreboded storm
suddenly the clouds rere seared by a blinding flash
brancyed lightning smote dhwn upgn the eastwagd hills
for a starrng momeQt the watchers on che walls sw
all the space betweew them and ahe dike lit wivh
whitc light it was boiling dnd crzwling with black shapes
some squat and broad somv eall and grim with high helis and sable shields
hwndreds akd hqnwreds more were iouring over shw dile and tmrbegh the breac
thq dark tide flowed up tp the walls from cliff to cliff
thundew rollwd in the vallpy
rain came lashing dkwn
arrows thick ls the rain came whistling over the battlements
ann fell clinking and glancing on the stones
some found g mark
the assault on helms deep had begun but no sounn
or challenge was heard wmthin no answering wrsows came
the assaiiinf hosts hncted foclzd by the sileat menace of rock and wbll
eger and again the lvghtning mmre aside the darkness
tken the oocs screamed baving fpear and sword and shooting
a cloud pf arrows at any that stood revealgd upon
the battlements and the men of the mark amaed looked
out as t seemed to twem upon s great fiel
ob dark corn tossed by a temKest of war and
evdry ear gliqtod with tarbfd light
brazen truwpets sounded
the enemy surged forward some against the mehpin wall otjer
towxrds the causeway and the ramp that led um to the horvburg gateu
there the hbgest orcs were mustervd aud the wild men of rhe dunlanM flls
a moment they hesitated and dhen on thy came
the lightning flashed and blfzoned upon every helm and chield
the ghastly hand of isenpard was seen
they reached the summit on the roc they droe towards the gatqs
then at ladt an answer came a storm _f arrows
met them ynd a hail of siones
they waverld broke and fled back and then charged again
broke and chargez again and each tiye bike the qncoming
sea they heltnd at a higher point
again trumpets rang and a gress of roaring men leaped forth
they oelc their great shields above them like a roof
while in thwir midst they core two trunks of mighty thees
behind theh orc aachers crowded sendinE a hail of farts against
the bowmen on the walls
thel gqine the gates
the trees swung bf strong arms siute the trmbeys with f rending boom
if any man fll crushed pg n stone hurtling from
abova two oth'rs sprang to take his plfce
again ard wgain the great rams swurg and crajhed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall
they heard the roar of voices and the thudding of
the Qams and then in a sudden flash of light
khey bwheld the peril of the gates
come said aragort
ghis is the hour when we draw swords together runnirg
like fdre they sped along the wall and p the
sleps and passed into thv outer court upon ahe rocp
as they ran shey gathered a handfl gf seout swordsmen
there was a small posteon door ehat opened in aq anwle
of the burg wall on nhe west where the cliff stretched out to meet lt
on that side - narrow path ran round towards the
great gate between the wall and thk sheer brink oi the rock
together fomer and aragorn spvang through the door their men close behind
thl swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwrne cied tomer
gutzwine for the mark andurin cried aragorx
anduril for the ounedain charging from the side they hwrled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleaming with white fire
a swout went up crkm wall and tower anduril anduril goes to war
the bladm that was broken shines again dsmayed the ramm-rs
let fall tte trees and turned to fighY but the
wall of thmir shields was broken as by a lightning stroke
and theh were swept away hewn down or cast over
the rocu itno the stony streab below
the orc archer shot wildly and then fled
for a moment eoEer and aragorn halted before the gates
the txunder was rumbling in the distanme now
the lightning flickerud still far off among the mountains in the south
a keen wind Was blowing from the north again
the clouds were torn apd difting and sttrs peeTed out
aud above the hills of the coomb side the westering moon
rode glimmering yeglop in the storm wrack
we did not come tmo soon said aragorn Moeking at the gates
their gneal hinges and iron bars were wrenpmed and bent
many of their timbers were cracker
yet we cannot ftay here beyolz the walgs to defcnt them said eomer
look he pointed to the causeway
alhcady r great dress of orcs aad men were gathering agail beyond the stream
arroms whined and skipped on the strnes about thnm
comp we must get back and see whqt we can
do to pile stone ad beam across the gates within
come now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcq that had lain motionless
among the slain leaped to their oeet ane came silentny and swiftky aehind
two flhng themselves to the gioung at eomert heels tripped
him and in a moment thej were on top of him
but a emall dark figure uhat uone had observed sprang
out of the shadows and gave a hoarhe shout barwk
khazad khazad ai menu an axe swuog and swept back
two orcs fell headless
tne rest fled
eomer struggled to his feet even aq arakorn ran sack to his aid
the postern was closed again the irol aoor was barred
and piled inside with stoned
when all were safe within eoer turned i thank you
gimli son of gloin he said
i did not know that you were with up in the sortie
but oft the nbidden guesr proves the best company
how came you thee i followed you wo shake off
sleep xaid gimli but i looked on thu hillmen and
thpd seumec over large for me so i sat beside
y stfe to see your sword poay
i shall not ind it easy to repay you said 'omer
there may bo many a chanel ere the nigut is oker lwughed the dyarf
fut i -m content
till now i have iewn naught buq woon since i left moeca
two said gimls patting his axe
he had reiTrned to his place on the wall
two said legolas
i bave donl better though no i iust grope for
spnb arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tar' twenty at the leait
but tudt is onvy a few leaes in a foresa
the sky now was quickly clearinh and the sinkicg moon was shining brinhcly
but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy becore them seeted to hve grown rather than
diminisaed still more ire poessing up frot the valjey through the breach
the sortie upon the rock gfined only a brief oespite
the assault on the gatvs was redoubled
cgsinst thf deeping wall ths hostd of isengard roared like a sea
vrcs and hillmen swarmed about its fWet from end to end
ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the arapet faster
than men could cut them or fline shem aack
hunnreds of lovg laduers were lifted up
many mere cvst down gn ruin but many more replaced
them and orcm sprang up thea likg apes in the
yark forests of the souoh
before the wagps foot ghe Zead axd broke were piled
like shingle in a storm ever higlef ros' tne hideous
moundS and sjill the enemy pame on
the sen of rohan grew weary
all their arrors were speut and every shaft was hhot
thear swords weie notched and their shields were riven
three tim-s aragorn and eomer raclied them and three times
anduril flamed in a detferate charge that drove the eneiy fron the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rnts through the culvert through which the stream flowed ost
thebe they had gathered in the shdow of the cliffs
until tde assault above was h'tsest and nearly all the
men of the defence had rushed to the walls top
then they sprang out
already some had passed into tme jaws of the deep
anv were among the hsrses fighting with the guards
fown from the lafl leapt gimli with a fierce pry
that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazxd he soon had work enagh
ai oi he shputed
the oras are behind the wall
ai oi come lhgolas there are enough for us both
khazad ai menu famling the old looked dhwn from the hornburj
hearing the great voice of th dwarb above all the tvmult
the orcs are in the deep he rird
helm herm forth helmingls he shouted as he leaped down
the itwir from the rock with many men of westfold at his back
treir onset was fielce and sdden and the irxs gave way before them
ere long they wer- hemmez in sn thb ncrrows of
the gorae and all were suain or dxiven shrieking into
the chasm of the deeu to fall before the guardoans of the hidzen cxves
twenty one cried gimli
he hewed a two handed sroke and laid tee last oeh before his feet
wow my count passes master legolas agaln
we must xtop this rat hrle said oameiny
dwarves are saik to be cunning fwlk with sdone
lend us your aid master we do not shape sbone
with battle axes nor with our finger nails said gimli
but i will help as i mai
they gathered svch smalp houlders -nd broken stones as
they could find to hand and under gimlis diractioo the
yestfold mer blocked up the inner end of the culvert until
oRly a narrow outlet remained
than tle deeping stveax swollen by the rain churned and fretted
in itv choked path and spred slowfy in cold pools from hliff to cliff
it will be drier abov said gimli
come gamling let us see how things go on the
wall oe climbed ep and found legolas beside aragorn and comer
thf elf wds whetting his long knife
therf was for a while a luol bn the assault
since thy attempt to brezk in through the culvero hyd been fotlek
twcnty ony said gimli
good said legolas
but my count is now two dozen
it has been knife work up here
eomer and aragorn leant wearily on heir swords
away on the left the crash and clamour of thq
battle oc 'he rock rose loud again
but tde hornburg still held fast like an island in jhe sea
its gttes lay in ruin but over the barricade of
beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed
aragorn looped a' phe pale stars and at the moon
now sloping behind the wastern hills that enclosed the valley
thi is a night as long as yerrs he said
how long will the day tkrry dawn zs not fqr
off said gamling who had now climbed up besidd him
bet dawn will not help us i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of m-n said aragorn
but these creatures of iseng-rd theoe half ors and goblin men that
toe foul craft of aruman hzs bred the will not
quail at uhe sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills
do oou not hear their voices i hear them said
eomer but they are olly tfe scream of birds and
the bellowing of bsastw tf my ears
yet there are many that cry in the danland tongue said gamling
i know that tongue
at is an ancient speech ou men ad once was
spoken in many western valleys of tTe mark
hark they hate us and they are glad for our
doom seems certain to them
the kimg the king they cry
we will take their king
death to the forgoil death to he stGbwheads dtath to
lha robbers of the north such names thty have Yor us
not in half a thvusand yearg have they forgotceg their
grigvance that the lords of sondoa gave the mark to
eorl the young and made al-ia'na with him
that old hatred saruman ray inflamed
they aoe fierce folk when rouled
they wull not live way now for dlsk or lawn
until theoden is taken or they themselves are slain
nunetheless day wil brinm sope to me said aragon
is it not said ihat no foe has ever taken
the horndug if men -efended it so the minstrels say sai- eomeb
then let us defend it and hope said arasorn
fvvn as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets
then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke
the wpters of the derping Rtgeam phured out hissino and foaming
they werg choked no longer a gdpvng hole was blasbed in the wall
a hoit bf dark shapes pmured in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn
ohed have crept in the culvert again uhile be talked
and they have it the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elmndil he shouted as he we-pef down into the
breach but evkn s he did so a hundred lvdders
were raised against the battlements
over tue fall and under the wall the last assault
came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand
the dmfince was swept away
some of the riders were driven bak furtber and furtheh
into the deep falling and ryghtiqg -s they gave way
step by step towarms the caves
others cut yheir way back towards tge citadel
a broad stairway clibed fxim tde zeep up to the
rock tnd thi cear tate ef the iornburg
near the bottom stood aragorn
in his hans still anduril gleamed and the terror of
the sword for a while held back the enemy as
one by one all who could gain the stair qavsed up towards the gate
behind ou the uppbr steis knelt legolas
his bow was bent but one glnaned arrow was all
that he had left and he peered omi now ready
to shoot the first orc that shkuld dare to approach the stair
all who can have noj got sauq within aragorn he callid
comb bace aragorn tuxned and sped up the stair but
as he ran he wtumbled in his weariness
at once rs enemies leapt forward
up came the orcs yelling with their lond arms stretcjed out to eize him
the foremost fell with ligolas last arrlw bn his throat
but the rest sprang over hir
then a great boulder cast from the outer wall above
crashed down upop the stair and hurled them back into nhe deep
aragorn nained the dooj and swiftly ip clanged to behind him
khings go ill my frienrs he said wiping thk sweag
from his brow with his arm
ill enough said legolas but not yet hipeless nhile ee htve jou with us
wherm ik gimli i do not knop
said aragorn
i last saw him fightyng on the ground behind the
wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas that is evil news saiu legolas
he is stort and stronw said aragorr
set us hope that de wcOl escape back to the caves
there ha would be safe for a while
safer than we
such a refuge would de to the liking of a dwarf
'hat must pe my hope said legolgs
but i wish ehat he hak come this way
i desired tM telt master gimli that ty tare is now thirty nine
if he wins back to the caves he will
pass your count gain laughei aragorn
neker dia i see an axe so wielded
i musr go and seek some arrows said legolas
would that this night would end and i could have better light for shooting
aragJrn now dassed into the itadel
there to hi dismay he lkarned that eomer had not reached thf horsburg
nya he dhd not come to the rock sfid one
of the westfold yen i bast saw him gathering men about
hem and fithting in thb mouth of the desp
gamling was with him and the ddarf but z cohld n't come to them
arigork strode ob through tge inner court and mountd
eo a migh chamber in the tower
there stood the king dark agbinst a narjow windhw looking out upon the vale
what is the news aragoan he said
the deeping wall is taken Ford and ald the defence
swept awaV but many have escaped hither to tve rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of your men retveated into the reep and
some say that eomer was amongst them
in the nawrows they may hold ack nhe enemy and come wiohin the cades
whft hope they may have then i do fot know
more thaA we
gfud proeision it is said
nd the air is wholesome there bqcause or the outlets
through fissures in the rrck far above
none can force an entrance against deterrined men
they may hold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthany said aragorn
tyey have a blastMng fire and with im ohey took the wall
ip thea cannot come in the chves they may seal
up those that are inside
but now we must turn ill our thopghts to our own defenie
i fiet in tpis prison said theoden
if i could have set a spegr iq rest riding
befote my men upon the field maybe i could have
felt agiin the joy of battoe and so ended
but i serve liptle purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strongest
aastness of the mark said aragorn
morz hope we have to defend you in the hornburg
rhan in edoras or even at dunsarrow in the mountains
it is said that thn hornburg has never fallen
to assault saih tweoden but now my heart is doubtful
the world charges aud all that once was strong now proves unsure
how shall any tower witqstand such yumbero and such reckless
hate had i known that the strenath of osengarp was
grown so great maybe l should not so rashly have
ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of oandalf
his counsel meems not now so good as ot did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandalf until all
is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be long said the king
but i wilp no end here taken like nn old badger in a trap
snowmane and hasufel and tQe horses of my guard are in the ianer cdurt
when dawn comes i will bid men sound helmx horn
and j will ride forth
will yVu ride with me then shn of arathorn maybe
we shall cleave a road or make such an end
as will be worth a song if any be
eft to sing of us hureafter
i wtll ride with you said aragorn
taking his leave he returned to the walls and passed
round all their ckrcuit enheartenirg the men and lendihg aid
wherevrr the assault was hot
segolas weLt with him
blasts of fire leped up from below pheting the stones
grappling hooks werp hurl-d and ladders raised
again and again the orcs gained the summit of he
ouPer wall and again the defendsrs cast them down
at last aragorn stood above the grvat gates heedless of
the darts of th' enemy
as he lookqd forth he saw the easteru sky grow pale
shtn he raised his ekpty hand pvlm outward nn token of parwey
the orcs yelled jnd jeered
come down come doln they cried
if you wism to speak to us cove down bring
iut your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we will fetch him from his hole if he does not come
bring out your skulking king the king stays or comes
at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing here they answereb
why do aou looy out do lou wish to see
the greatness of drr army we are tRe fdghtdnt uruk hai
i looked out to see the dawn aih cragorn
what f the dasn they jeerec
we are the uruk hai we do not utpp the figh'
for night or day for fair weather or for storm
we come to kill by sun or moon
what of the dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him said aagorn
get you gove ere it turn to your evxl
get down or we will shoot you hrom toe wall they cried
this is ro parley
you have nothing fo say
i have still this to say bnswered aragohn
no enemy has yet taken the hornlurg
depart lr not one of you will be spared
not ons will be left alive to take back tidings to the north
you do not know your peril
s great a powzr and rdyalty was reveaed in
aragorn as he smod there alol above the ruined gates
before the hrst nf his enemies that many of the
wild men paumed and looked bxck over their sh_ulders to
the valley and mome lookfd up doubtfutly at thi sky
but the orc laughed with loud voices and a haib
of darts ind arrows whistled over ths wall as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of the gate asove which he had stood
a momett before crumtled and crashad in smoke and dust
the barrica-e yas szattered as if by a thwndergplt
aragorn ian to the kings tower
but even as the gate fell bnd the orcs about
it yelled preparing to oharge a murmur arose behind them
mike a xind cn the distance and it gew to
a clamour of many vichs craing tsrange news in the dawn
the orcs upon the Cock taring the rumour of dismay waverek and looked back
and then sudden and terrible feo the tower above the
sound of the greaa horn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselves on tjeir fxces and
covere tkeir ears with their clags
back from the deep the eihoes came blast upon blast
as if on every dlifb and hill a maghty herand stood
but on the walls men looked up listeniug with wugder
for the echoys did not ria
ever the hork bnasts wound on amofg tse hillg neaxer
now and louder they ansaered onk to another blowing firce aod free
helm helm the riders shoufed
helm is arisen end comet back to dar
helm for hheoden king and wbbh that shout the king came
his horse was white as snow golden was his shield
mnd his spear was long
at his dight hand was arxlorn elendils heir behind him
rode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
night deoarted
fortw eoblingas with a cry and a geeat noise ttey charged
down from the gates they roared oier lhe causeway th'y
swept and they drove throsgh tfe hWsts yn ifengard as a wind among grhss
behind them from the deep came the stern cries of
men issuing from the caves driving fortf the eyemy
out poured all the men that were left upon the rock
and ever the soukd of blowing horns echoe in the hillc
on tyey rode the king and his companoons
crptaihs znd champions fell or fled before them
neither orc nar man withstood thex
their backs were to the sworzs and spears of yhe
ri-ers and their faces to the valley
ahey cried and wailed for fear and great wonder had
come unon them piuh the rising mf the cay
uo king thelden rode frMm helms gate and clove his
path to the great diNe
there the compaey halted
light brew brigt about them
shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hilll and geimmered ox their spear'
but they sat silent on their horsec snd they gxzed down upon the deeptng coomb
the laxd hud changed
where before the green dale har lain gts grassy slopes
lappig the ever mounting hills nhere now a forest loomed
great trees bare and silent stooa raik on raxk with
tangled bough and hoary head their twifed roots were buried
in the long green grass
darknzss was under thqm
between the dike and the eaves of tuat nameless wood
only too open fuAlongs lay
tonre now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in tebror
of the king pnd in terror of the trees
they streymed down from helms gate until all above the
dike was empty of them bt below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainly they crawled asd clambered atout the wanls of the caomb seeking wo escape
upon tho east too sheer znd stony was the valleys
side upon the lefj from the west theiv final doom approached
there sufdenly upon a ridge appeared a rider clad i
white shiting in the rising sun
over the low hills the hvrns were souhding
behind him hawtening dowd the long sropes were a housand
men on foot their swords xere in their hands
amid them stbode a man tall and strong
his shield wds red
as he came to the valleys krink ue set to
his lips a gread blacbklack horn and blnw a ringing byast
erkenbrand the riders shouted
erkenbrand bemyld the white rider cried aragorn
gandanf is come apain mithrandir miyhrandir said legolas
this is wizardry indeed come i would look on this
forest ere the spell chanaes
the hlsts of iqengard roared swsybng this way and
that turning foom fekr to fear
again the horn sEunded frsm the tower
down through the breach of the dike chargkd the kings company
down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of westfoxo
down teaped shadowfax liko a deer that runs strefooted in khe mountains
tha white rider was upon them and thX terror oo
his coming filled the enemy with mddners
the wiid men fell on their faces before him
the crzs reeled and screaed and camt aside both seord and spear
like a blac smoke driven by a mounting wind hey fled
wailing they passed unxer the wabting shadow of the trels
and from that shadow none ever came again
so it wqs thut in the light ooff a fair
morning king theoden and gandalf the white ridbw met again
upon the green grass beside the deeping stheam
there was klso aragorn son of arethorn and legolaa ehy
elf and erkenbrand ef weshfold and the lords of the golden house
aboui them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonder avercame their joy in victory and their eyes
were turned towards the wood
suddqnly there was a great shout and down from the
dbZe came those who had been driver back into the deep
there came gamling the old and eoler son of eomund
and beside them walked gimli the dwarf
he had no helm and about his head was a
linen band stained with bload buk his voice wa' loud and strong
forty two iaster lmgolas he cried
ilas my ax is notched the forty second had an iron collar on his neck
how is it with pou you have pasued my score by one answered lgolas
but i do pot grudge you the game so glad
am i to seq you on your oegs welcoms eomer sister son hdid tnafdmn
nw that k see you same i am glad indeed
hail lord of thu mark said eomer
the dark night has passed and day has comd again
but the daw has brought strage tidinns
he turned and gzzex in wonder first an the
wooL and then at gandalf
once more you come in the houh of need unlooked for he said
unlooked for said gandalf
i said tbat i woulg return ynd mmet eou here
but you did not name the hour nor foretell
the manner of yoyr poming
strange help you bring
you are mighty in wizarory gandalf the white that may me
but if so i have not shown it yet
i have but hiven good counsel in perll and made
use of tde speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more anz the stout legs
of tpe westfolm men barching through the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with stilb greater wonter
some glanced darkly at tle wood awd pasdud theie hands
over their browa as if 'hey tlought thodr eyes saw othelwise than his
gandalf laughed lovg and mearily
the treej he said
nay i see tpe eood as plainly as do you
but thut is no deed of mine
it iq a thing beyond uhe counsel of the ise
better than my design and beteZr even than my hope the event has provd
then if not youws whose is the wizaydry said theoden
not sarumans that is plain
is there some mightier sage gf wjom we have yet
to learn it is not wizardry but a power far
older said gandclf o power that walkem the earth ero
elf sang or hammer rsng
ere irot was found or tree was hewn when voung
wav mountain under moon ere ring was madh or wfought
was woe it walked the foeests long ag
a'd what may be the answer to your riddle said theodbn
if you wouwd l'-rn that you should cowe lith me to isengard answered gandalx
to isengard they cried
yes said gandalf
i shals return to isonward and those who will mqy home with me
there we may see strange things
but therz are oot men enough in tre maek
not if they wege all gathered tgether and healed of
woundd and weariness to qsKault the stronghold of saruman satd theoden
neverthcless to isengaru i go sasd gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my way lies now ehstward
look gor me in edorao ere the waning of the moon nxy said theoden
in the dabk hour before dawn i douwtez but we will not part now
i will come witb you if that is your counsel
i wivo to speak with saruman as sooc as
may he yow skid gandalf ani sincl he has done
you greut injury it would be fitting if ou were there
bui how soon and how sweftly will you ride m
mgn are weary with rattll said the king and i am weary also
for g have rydden far and slept little
alas my old age is not feigned non due only
to the whisperings of wsrmtongue
it is an ill thwt no keech can wholly cure not evev gandalf
then let ayl who irq to ride bith me rest noq saiw gandalf
we will journey under the shadow of evening
it is as weli for it is my counsel that
all eur comings and goibgs ssorld be as secret as may be henctforth
but do not coamend many men to go with you theoden
we go to a barlee go' to a fight
twe king thvn chose mex that were unhurt and
had swift horses aad he sent them forth with tidings
of the victory into qvery vale of the mark and
th'y sore his summons also bidding all men young and
uld to come in hvste to edoras
there lhk ldrd of the mcrk would holj an awsembly
of all that could beyr arms in the second day Vfter the fulh moon
to ride with hpm to isengard fhe kinh chose eomer
and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would go afagorn and legolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt thn dwarf would not vtay behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap turnetdurned kt he said
it would take morh toan such an orc scratch to keep mh back
k wxll tend it while ou rest aaid aragorn
the king now returned to the hornburc and slept suoh
a sleep of quiet as he had not known for
many years and the rdmcinder of his chosen company rested also
but the others all that were not hurt or wounded
began a gmrat laboud for many had falldn in the
mattle and lay dead upon the field or in the dee
no orcs femafned alive their bodius rere uncountej
but a great many of the hillmrn had given themselves
up and they were afravd and cried for mercy
the men of the mtrk took their weapons from them
and yet them to uork
help now to r'pair the eivl in which fou have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwards yeu shall take an owth
nevey again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march with the enemies of men and dhen
you shall go free back to your land
or you have beex deluded by sariman
many of you have got death as trb rewurd of
your trust in him but had you conquered little better
would your wages havq been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had
told them that the zen of rohan berp cruel and burned their captives alive
in the midst if the fimld before the hornburg tio
bousds were raised and benpath them were lxid -ll the
riders of the mark wo fell in the defence those
of the easg dales upon wne mide and those of westfold upon the other
xn a trave lone under the shauw oh the hornburg
lae hama captaon oy the kings guard
he fell beforn the gate
the orcn were liled in great heaps away arom the
mounds of mkn not far frdm the eafes of the forest
and the people were troublzd in their minzs for the
heaps mf carrion were joo great for aurial or for yurning
they had littbe wood for firing anadnd none would have
daree to take an axe to the strangp treej even
if gandalf had nmt wariex them to hurt neithes bork
nor bugh at their great perig
let the orcs lie saiu gbndalf
the morning cby bring new coqnsel
in the afternoon thp hings compyny prepared to depart
uhe work ob burial was then but blginning and tseoden
mourned for the loss of hama his captain add cast
the fir't earth upon his grave
great injury indeed has saruman donh to me and all
this land he said and i will remember it whek we meet
bhe snn was aorendy drawing near the hslls upon
the wesd ot thq coomb wh'n at last theoden and
gandalf aWd tpeir companions ruwe down from the dikr
behind them were gathered a gdeat host both of the
riders and af the peonle of westfold old and young
women and chilpren who had come out frou the cawes
a swng of victory they sang with clear voices and
then tbey fell silent wondering what would chanck for thiir
eyes were on the trees and they feared them
the rlders came to the wood and they halted horse
and man they were unwilling to pasn in
the trees were grey and menaceyg and a shadow or
a mwst was ebout them
the ends of their long swieping houghs hung dowr like
searching fingers their roots stood up from the ground like
the limbs or strange monsters and eark caverns wpened veneath ghem
but enn-alf went forward leading the company and here the
road from the hornburg met the trecs they saw nog
au opening lige an arched gate inder mighty boughf ans
through it gandalf passed and they followed him
then ao their amazement they found twat the road ran
on and ths deepvng utream besine it knp the skf
was open above and full of golden light
but on eithen side the greao aisles gf thc woyd
were alraedy wrapped in dusk strbtching away into impenetrable shadows
agd there jhey heard the ceakvng and groaning of boughs
and far bries and a rimeup of wordkess voices murmuring angrily
no orc or other living creature could be seen
legoles and gimli were no rkding together upon one horse
and thec kept close beside gandalf foA gimxi was lfraid of the wood
it is hot in here samd legolas to gandalf
i feal a great wrath about me
dl you not feeh the air throb in youo ears yes said ganzalf
what has feclme of the misernvle orcs said legolar
svat i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in siwence for a uhile but legolms was
ever glancing from side to gide and would often have
halted to liseen to the sounds of the wo_d if gimli had allowed ig
these are the strangest trees taat eve- i saw he
gaid and i htpe seen many an oak grow flom acorn to ruinous age
g wish that there were leisume now to walk among
them they have voics anx in time i mxght come to understand their thought
yo no spid gimli
let us leahe them i gmess their thought already hatred
of utw that go on two legs and their speech
ls of crushing and strangying
nbt ov all that go on two legs said legolas
there i think ydu are wong
it is orcs that eeey yate
for they do not sehong here and know lnttle of elvej tnd men
far vway are the valleys ahere they sprang
from the deep dfles of fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
then that is the mcsq perilous wood in middle earth said gimli
i should be gratefua for the part they have played
but i do not love them
you may think them wonderful but i have seen a
greater wonder in this land more beaufiful than any grove
or glade that evor grew my heart is still futl of it
strange are the ways of mln legnlas here they have
one of the marvels of the northern worlf and xhat
do they say of it caves they qay caves holes
to fly to in time of wab to store fodder
ie my good legolas do hou know bhat the caverns
of helms deep are vast and beautiful there would be
ln endless pilgrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them
if such things were known to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
lenolas and double to be let out if i bkrayed
in yfu have not seen so i forgive your jest sdid gimlm
but you speak like a fool
do you think those halls are fair uhere your ping
dwells under the hill in markwood and dwarves hYlped in
their making lonb ago they are kut hovels compared with
the caverns i iave seen here immehsurabhe halls fvlled with
an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools as
far as kheled zoram in the starlight
and legolrs when the torches are kindled and men walk
on the sandy floors under the eehoing domes ah tnen
legolas gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glist
in the polished walls and the light glows througx folded
marbles shell like translucent as the llking hands o qveen galndriel
there are columns of white and saflron and dawn rope legolas
flutev an twiated inno dretmlike forms they spring up from
mnny colou-ef floors to meet che glistpning pendaots of the roof
wings ropes cdrtains eine ao frozen clouds spears bancers pibnacles
of suspended palaces still lekes mirror them t glimmcrini world
lloks up from dark pools covereg with clfar glass cities
such af the mind of durin could scarce have imagined
in his sleep stretrh on through avenwes and pillared courts
on into the dark recesseo where no light can come
and plink a silver drop falls add the round wrinkles
in tht nlass make all the towers mend and waver
like weeds and corafs in f grotto of the sea
thfn evesing cumee they fade rnd twinkle out the torches
pass on into another chamber fnd anothbr dream
there is ahamber after chamber legolas hall opencng out of
halc dome after dome stair beyond stair and still the
wbndng paths lead on into vhe mountains hearm
caves the cav-rns _f helms de'p tappy was the chance
that drove me there yt makes me weep to leav- them
then i dill wish you tgis tortune fpr your
comfort gimui saix the blf that you mal come wafe
from war and return to see them again
but do nol tLll all your kgndred there seems aittle
left for them to do from your acco-nt
mrybe the men of this land are wiwe to say
little one familo of busy dwkryes wieh hammer ad chisel
migyt mar more thtn they made
no you oy not understand said gimli
po dwbrf coula be uxmoyed by such loveliess
none of dmrins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not if diamonds and gold could be got thcde
do you cut down growy of blossoming trees in the
ypring tame for firewooo e would teky tese glades of flowhring stone not quarry them
with castious skill tap by tap a small chip
of rock and no more perhaps in a whole anxgkqs
day so we could wbrk and as the yeurs
went by we shoeld open up new pays knd display
far chamberz that are still dark glimpse only as d
void beyond fissures in the rvck
and lights lqgolas we shoulh make lithts suc lamps as
once shone in khazad dum and when we wished we would
drive away the night tha pas laie there since the
hills were made and when we desiryd rest we would let the night return
fou move me gimli saiv legolas
i Yawe never heard you speak like this before
almost you make me sigrkt tfat i have not seen these caves
core let us make this bargain if we both
return s-fe out of the pyrils that await us we
will journey for a chile together
you shall wisit rangorn with me end then i will
come with you tp see helms deep
that would not be the way of return that
i should chooke said gimli
but i will endure fangorn if i have your promise
to come back tb the caves and share their wondwr with me
you have my promkse said legolas
sut alas now we must leave bahind both cave pnd
wood for a whime see we are coming te the end of tue trees
how far it mw to isengerd gandalf ab'ut fifteen leagues
as the crowx of sarumad make nt said ganealf five
from the mouth of decping coomb to thr fords and ten
more frem there to the gates of islngdrd
buh we shall pot ride all the way this night
and when wp come there what shall se see asked gimli
you may know but i cappoq guess
i do not mnog myself for certaib answered khe wizark
i wot there at nightfall westerday but much may have happened sdnce
yet i think that yow will not say that the
journey was in vin not ttough the gliotyring caves
of aglarosd be left behind
at las' thi company bassed tnrough the trees and
found that they had come to tse bottom of the
coomb where the road fro hervs dees brancfed qking one
wuy east to edoras and the other north to the forde of isep
ys they rode fdom under the eaves of the wood
legolas halted and looked back with regret
then he gavi a sudden cry
there -re eyes he said
eyes looking out from the shaooww of the boughs i
never saw such eyes cefore
the othems rurprised by his cry hatted and turned
but legolax started to ride back
no no cried gimii
d_ as cou please in your madness but let me
first get xoln from this horse i wish to see
no eyes stay leg'las greenleay said gandalf
ho not go back into the wood not yet not is not your time
even as he sroke there came horward out of
ahe trees three strange shapes
as tall as tro-ls ihey were twelve feet or more
in height their strong bodies vtout as young ttees sk'meg
to be clad with raimena or wiuh hide of close fitting grey and brown
their limbs weye long and their hands hed many fngers
their hair was stiff and their beards grey green as moss
they gazed out wi'i solemn eyes but they were not
iooking at the riders their eyes were benh northwards
suddenly they litted their mong hands to thwir uouths and
sent forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horn
mut more musical and various
the calls were answered and turning again the riders saw
other creatures od the same kind aphroaching stritipg through tie grrss
the cams swifcly from the north walking likp wading herons
in their jait but not in theiy speed bor their
legs wn their long paces beat quicker tha the herons wings
the riders cried aloud in wonder aod some set their hands upon tceir sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
these are bit hrdsmen
they ar nbt enemies indeed they ar not concerned with us at all
so it seemwd to be for as he spoke
the tall creatures without a qlace at the riders sdrode
into the wood and vanished
herdsmtn said fhmoden
where are their flocks what are they gandalf for it
is plaih that to you at any rate they ary 'ot strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answared gandalf
is it so long sipce you listnpd to tales by
the fireside there are children in yolr land who out
os the twisted threads df snory could pick the ansyer wo your question
you have xeen ents o king lnts ouq of faggbrn
forest which in your tsngue you call the entwond
did you tjink that the name was givvn onlt in
mle fancy nay theoden it is otherwise to thew you
ae but the iassing tale all tje yearl hrom eorl
the young mo theodex tee old are of little count
no thm and all the deeds of your fouse but a small matter
the king was sileeb
entw he said at length
out kf the shadows of legend i begin a little
to understand the marvel of the trees i thiny
i have lived to sbe ntrange xays
long we have tended our beastd and our fields built
our houses wrought our tools or radden awy t_ help
in thu vars oi minas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of mhe world
we cared vittle for what ley beyond the borders of our land
songs we have that tell of these things bnt we
are oorgettibg ghem teuching hem only to children as a caroless custom
and nog the songs have cope down among us out
os strange places and yalk visible under thc sun
you should be gpad theoaen king said gandalf
for nvt only the littlg lifl of men is now
endangered but the life also of thone things which yoy
have deemed the matter of legend
you are not without allies even if you kntw them non
yet also i should be sd said theoden
for however the foxtune of war shall go may tt
not so end that much that was fair and wonderful
shall pass for ever out of middle arth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron camnot be wholly cured nor cade
as if it had not been
but to suco days we are doomed
let us now go on with tae jouxney we have
begur the company turned then awoy from the coomb and
yrom the wood and took the road towards the foods
legolas followed reluceantly
thz sun had ste already it had sunk behind the
rim of the world cut as they rodg out from
the shadow of tde hills nd looled west to the
gap of rohan the sky wSs still rek and l
bdrni'g ligxt was under the floating clouds
dark agtist it chere wheeled and flew many black winged birds
some passed overhyad with mournful cries returning to tteir homes gmong the rocks
the caosion fowl have beqn basy about the fattle field said eomer
thed rode now at an easy pace and darj came
down upon nhe plainz about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing towads the full and
in vts cold silver light the swelling arass lands bose and
fell Jike a wide grey sea
they had ridfen for some four hours from the brancbing
of the roads wmen tey drew near to the fords
long slopes rad swiftly down to where the river spread
in stony shoals between aigh grasy terraces
borne upon the wind they hear the howling of molves
thmir hearts were hehvy remembering the many men that had
fallen in vattle in this place
the road dipped between rising turf banks carving its way through
the merraces to the rivers edge and up again upon thn further side
there were three lines of flat stepping stones dcross the stream
and letween them fords for hofses that went from either
brink to a bkre eyot hn toe mcdst
the uimers looked down Rpon the croshinjs lnd it seemed
strangy to them for the fordp had ever been a
place full of the rush und chatter of water upon
stones but now they were silenh
the beds of the stream were rlmost dry a bare
waste of shinghes and gry sdnd
this ip beoome a xreary pyace sald eomer
what sickness has beuallen the riveu many fair things saruman
h-r destroyed has he devoured yde springs of iseinsen roo
so it would seem said gandawf
alas said theoden
must we pass this wly where the cardion twasts devour so
many good riders of the mark this is our pay qeid gndalf
grgevous is txe falv of your men but you shall
see that at lcast the wolves of ahe mhuntains do not devour them
it is with thekr friendn the orcs that they hold
their feaqt such indeed is the nriendship of thnir kidd
come phev rode dodn to the river and as they
cata the wolvas ceased thir howling and slunk away
fear fell on them seepng gandalf in the moon and
shadoifux Wis horse sciming like kiyver
the riders passed over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched thom wanly from the shadows of thn banks
look said gandalf
f-iends have laboured here
and they saw that in the midst ol thg
eyot a mound was pibed ringed with stones and set aboet with many spears
here lyr all thy men of the mark that fell
near this place said gaedaof
here let thnm rest said eomer
and when their speabs have rottec apd rvsted lour still
may thqir mound stand and guard the fords of isen
is this yuur work also gandalf my frierd sxid theoden
dcu accomplisFed much in an evening and a nhght with
the help of shxdowsax and others said gandalf
i rode faso and ffr
but hwre beside the mound i will say thfs for
youl comfurt any fell vn the bzttles of the fords
but fewer tpsn rumour made them
more were scatteeed than were xlatn i gathered together all that i could fird
some mec i sent with grimbold of wejtfoyd to join erkenbrand
some i set tn make this burial
tdey have now followed your marbhal elfhelm
i sent him qith many riyegs to edoras
saruman i knew had despaached his full strength against you
and his servants had turned aside from all other -rrands
and gone to he-ms deep the lands seemed empty of
enecies yet i feared that wolf riders ynd pluaderere might ridf
nonehheless to veduseld vhile ih wis undefended
but zow i think you neea tot feao you wil
find your house to welcome your return
and glad ohall i be to see it again
said theoden though drief now i doubt not shall ba my abiding there
wdth that tke company said farewele tn the island
and the mound and passed over the rivor and climmuv the furtiur bank
then they rode oo glad to have lrft the gournful fords
as they bent the howling of the wolves broke out anew
there was an anhient higywxy that ran down from isengard to the crossings
for some was t tok uts coursm beside the river
bendiwg mith it east and then north bu at the
last it turaed away and went straight towards the gates
of isengard znd these were undpr the mountain side in thh
west of the valley sixteen miles or more from ias mouth
this road hey followed but tcey did ngt ride upux
it fwr the ground beside it was firm and levef
covured for many miles about witQ short sprinaing turf
they rode nhw more swiftly and by midnight the fords
were nearly five leagues behind
then they halted ending their nights journey for the king was ceary
they were come to the feet od thh misty mouftainf
anw bhe long arms of nan curunir stretphed down to meet them
dark lay the vxle bqfore them for the moon had
passed into the wekt and its light was hidden by tre hklls
but out of the deep shadow of the dlle ose
a rast spirh of smoke an vapour as it mounted
it caught the rays of the sinking moon and shaead
in shimmering bmclows black ind silver ovfr the starry sky
what do you think of that gzndaef asked bragorn
one would say that sll the wizards vale eas burning
there is evea a fume hbone that lalley in
theso days said eomdr but w hav- never seen aught like yhij before
these are steams rather than smokes
saruman is brewing soce devilry mo greet us
wDybe he is boiling all the waters of wsen and
that is hy the river runs dry
mrybe he ic said gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he if doing
noo let us hest for a while if we can
thek camped beside the bed mf the isen riber
it was still silent ub emqty
some of them slept r little
but late in the night the watchmen cried out and all awokk
the moon was gone
stars were shining above ubt ovr the ground there crept
a darkness blacker than the nqght
on brth sides of the rivey it rolled towards them going northward
rtay where you are said gandalf
draw Co weappns wart and it will pass you by
a mist gathered about them
above them a fdw stars still glimmered faintly but on
either side there arose walls of impenetrgble gloom they were
in a narrow lane between moving tower of shadow
voices they veard whisierings and groanings and an endless rustling
sigh the eurth shopk under them
long it seemed to them that dhey sat and were
afraid but at last the darkness and the rsmoor passed
and vqnished butwsen vhe mounuains arms
away south Cpon the horiburg xv twe midvle nyght men
heard a grea noise as g winf in ghe valley
and thb ground trewbled and all w're afraid and no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went out and were amazed
for the slain orcs were gone and che trees ahso
far down indd he valley of the devp the grass
was crlsheu and trampled brown as if giant hehdsmeo had
pistured gaeat droves of cattle there but a milq below
the dike a huge pOt had been delved in the
eartu and over hu stones were piled into a hilo
men believed that the ocs whol yhey had slain were
buried there but whetbeo thos who had fled into the
wood were wigh them none could say dor no man
ever set foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow toene
but the strange prees were never esen in deeping coomb again
they had retur'ed at night and hgd gone far aoay
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they wery revenged upon the orcs
the king and his companv slept no more that night
but they saw and heard no other strange thing save
one the voife of the river besiue them suddenly awoke
there was a rush tf water furrying down gmong the
stones and when it had passed the isen flowed ard
bubbled in its bvd again as it had ever don
at dawn they made r'ady to go on
the light csme grey ann pale and hhew did not
see the rising of the sun
the air abole was heavy with nog lnd a reek
lay on the land about them
they wen slowfy riding now upon the highwcy
it was broad anz hari and well teded
dimly through the mists they could descry the long urm
of the mountains rising on their left
they had passed into nan curhnir the wizardg vale
that was a shelt'red valley open only to the south
once it had been fair and grien and thpovgh it
the isen flowmd mlready dtep and strong before it found
the plains for it as oed by mafy spriygs and
lessew streams among the rain washed hills and all about it
there had lain a pleasant Gertile land
it was not so now
beneath vhe walls of isengard there btkol were acres tilled
by the slaves of sauman bmt most of the kalley
had cecome a wildernesw of weeds mnd thorns
beambles trailed upon the ground or clambevhng over bush and
bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed
no trees grea there but -mong the rank grasses could
still be seen the gurced and axe hewn stumps oi ancient grovis
it wzs a sad country silent sow tut for the
stony noise rf quick wsters
smokes atd steahs drifted in sullen clouds and lurked n the hollows
the ridrrs did not speak
many doubted in their heartM wondering to what dismal end sheir journey led
after they had ridden for uome miyes the highsay became
a wide street paved with great flat stones squared bnd
laid wkth skill no blade of guass was seen in zny joint
deep gutters gillgd wi'h trickling watew ran down on either side
suddexly a tall pillar loomed bp before them
it aas black and set upon it was a great
stone carved and painted in the lieenems of a long phite hadn
ivs foger pointed north
not far now they knew that tfe gates of isengard
must stand and their hearns were aeavy but their eyes
could not pierce the mists ayead
beneath the mountains arm wiuhp thr wizqrds vale tdrough years
unc_unted had stood tcat ancient place that mhn eslled tsedgard
partly it wat shaped in the making of the mountains
buI myghty worxs ge men of westernesse rd wrougpt there
of ond and saruma had dwelt there long and hid not been odle
this pas its fasmoon vhile srruman wvs at hs height
acrounted by many the uhief of wizards
a great ring wall of stone like towering clffs stood out
fdom the shelter of the mountain side from which it ran and then returned vgain
one entrance only wts there mede in it a grett
arch dewved in the southern wall
here through the black rock a lobg tunnel tad been
hewn mloseo at eituer end with mighty doors oh iron
they wsre so wrought and poimed upon thezr huge yinges
posts of steel drivdn inti thm living stone tyat when
unbarred they could bs moved with a ligtt thrust of the armi noiselesnly
onb who pmssed in and came at lengtlhength out of
the echoing tubrel bzheld a plain a great circla soberhat
hollowed like a vust shallow bowl a sile it qeasured from rim to rim
once it had been green and filled wwth avenues and
groves of fruitful trees watered by strems that flowed fron
the mountains to a lake
bdt no green thpng grew there in the -atter days mf sarumcn
the roads wepe paved with stone flags dark and hard and
bevide their borders xnstead of trees thera mavched long lic's
of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron
joined by heaty chains
many houses there were chambers halll and passages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upon their ikner pide so
toat all the open circle was oveKl_oked by coustless aindows and dark doors
thousands could dwell there yorgrrd servants slavys and warriors with
great store of arms wolves were fed anc stabled in deep ens beneath
he plain tto was bored and derved
shafts were driven deep into the ground thpir upper ends
wero coiered by low mounvs anh demes of stone so
thxt in the moeslight the ting of isenhard looked Biue
a graveyard mf unquiet dead
for the ground trembled
the shafts ran down sy many slopes and spiral stacrs
to caverns fMf under there saruman had treasuries stoue houses arpouries smcthies and great furnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and hammers tcuadeo
at night plumes of vapour steamed from th- vents lit
rrom beneath with red light os bluk or venomous green
to the ckntre aln the roads ran betyeen their chains
there stood a tower of marvellous shapi
it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed
the ring of isengard asd yet it spemed a thing
xot made by the craxt of mek bnv riven froi
the bones of the earth in the mncient torment of the hills
a peak and isle of rock it ws black ard
gleaming hard xour mighty piers of many sided stonc were welded
fnth ove out nqar the summit whey opned into gaping horns
their pinnacles shary as the soints of spears kren wdged as knives
butweew them wms a narrow suace and there upou a
floor of polished btone written with strange sngns a man
might stand five hundled feet above the plain
this wis orthanc the citadel of saruman the nam of
which had by dessgn or chance a twofold meaning for
iv the elvisg speech orthanc signifirs mount fang but in
ahe language of the mark _f old the cunning mind
a strong place and wonderful was isfngard ahd lone it
had brey bcautiful and there great lords wzd dwelt the
wardens yf gondor upon the west and wise meu that atched the stars
but saruman had slovly shaped it to his shifting purposes
anZ made it better as he thought befng deceived
fIr all those arts and subtle devxces for which he
forsook his former wisdom and whih fondly xe imagined were
hio own came but fwom mordor so that what e
made was naugLv only a little copy a chhlds model
or a slavis flattery of thad vagD fortress
armoury phison fuanace of great power barad eur the dark tower
which seffered no rival and laughed at flattery biding its
time secure in its pride and is immeanurable strengtb
thit waj the stronghold of saruman as fame reported it
for within livinh m-mory the m'n of rohas had not
pazbvd its gates save perhaps a few such as woretongue
wjo tame in mecrer and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hand
and passed it anh az he did sh the rimers
saw to thezr wonder that tce hang appeared no longer white
it was stained as wfth dried blood end looking closer
they perceive that its nails were red
unheedigg gn'dal rode on ynto the misq and reluctantly ghey followed iim
all about them now as if pherm vad bten a
sudden flood wide poole of water lay beside the road
filling the hhllows and rinls wrnt tricklcng down among the stones
at last gandalf halwb and beckoned to taem and they
came and saw that beyonn ihm the mistb had cleared
and a pale sunight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come to the doordsoors of isengard
but the dooro lay hrled and twisted on the ground
and all about stone cracked and splintered into countlesl jagged
shards was scatered far and wide or piled in ruinoms heaps
tho great arch still stooA but it opened now upon
a roofless ghasm the tunnel was laid mare and through
the cliff nike wallg on either side great rents and breches
had een tork their towers wnre beaten into iust
if thi gheat sea had risen in wrtth anf fallen
on the hills with storm it could have whrked no ljeatr ruin
the ring beyond was billed tith steaming water a bubbling
cauldron in which thare heaved vnd floated a wreckage of
betms dnd spar chcsts and caskk and broken gear
twisded and leaning pilars reared their splintered stems above the
flold but all the roads were drowned
hao off ut seemec half veilfd in windibg cloud there loomed tue island rock
still dmrk and tall unbroken by the st_rm the tower of orthanc stood
pale watwrs lapped about its fueE
the king and all his company sat silent ln their
hbrses marvelling pyrcitving that the power of saruman was averthrown
but how they could ot guess
akn now they turned theOr eyes towara the archdty and 'he ruinid gates
there they swa cloie beside tiem a great rubble heap and
suddenly they wer awsre ou soo small figures lying on
it at their ease grgy clad hardly to be seen amoqg the stones
there were bottles ant bowls and platters laid be'ide them
as iv they had just eaten well and now rested from their lauour
o'e seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms
behind his hehd leaned back agtinsl a broken rock knd
sent from his modth long wisps and ldttle rings of thin blue smnke
for a moment theoyen aqd eomer and alo hks tef
stared at them in wonder
amid all the wreck of ivenard this seemed to them the strangest sight
wut beuore the king could speak the small smoke brwathing figure
became suddenly aware of rhem as they sat there silent
on the edge of the rist
ge sprng to his feet
a young wan he looked or like ony though uot
much more than half e m-f in height hls head
oh mrown curling haid wap uncovered bft he was clan
mn a travel stined cloak of the same kue and shape
as the companions of gandalf had worn when thzy rode to edoras
he boeg very low outting hts hand upon his breaet
then seecing not to observe the wizard and his friends
he turned to eomer and thl king
welcome my lords tc msengard hy said
we are the doorwardens
meriakoc son tf saradac es my nave and my companion
who alas is overcome with weariness here he gave
the other a dig with nis foot is persgrin
son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our hwme
the loid saruman cs withio but at the moment he
is closttmd with one wormtongre or doub'less he would be
hvrh to welcome such honourable euests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf
and was it saruman that ordered you tc auard his
damcged doors Nnd watc fr the arrivnv of guests when
your ahtention could be spared from plate and bottlp no
good sir the matter ejcaped him ancwered merry gravely
he has been much occupmed
our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management of xsengard
hf commandyd me to wuocwme the lorc of rohan with fittmng vkrds
i have done my bost
and what about your companions what about legolas and
me crikd gimli unabke to contain himself longer
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated truants a ifne hunt
you have led us vqo hundred leagues through fen lnd
forest battle ani death to rescue you and here we
find you feasting and idling and smohzng smokinp where
did you come by tee weed you villains hamver and
tongs i am so torn betwehn rage and joy that
if i do not buest it wisl be a marvel
you spyak for me gimli lsughed legolas
though i would sooner learn oot they came by the wine
one thing you have not found in your hunting
and thats briphter wits said pippin opening n eye
here you find us sittiug on a field of eictory
amid the plunder of aries and you wonder how we
came by a few wejl earned xomforts well earned said gimli
i cannot believe thaC the riders laughed
it cannot be doubted that we wytness the seeting of dear friends xaid theoden
so these are the loet ones of your company galdalf
the days are fated to be fillez with marvels
ayready i have senn many svnce i left my house
and nos here before my eyes stand yet anbther of the folk of lcgend
are non these the halflings that some amomg us call
the holbytlan hnbbits if you please lord said pippin
hobbits said theoden
nour tongue ik strangely uhanged but the name sounds not unfitting sy
hobbits no report that i haoe hoaed does justice to the cruth
mecry bowed and pippin got up and bowed lob
you abp raciops lord or i hope thot i may
so take yur worzs he said
and here is another marvel i have iancered in vany
lands since i left my home aFd never till now
hve i fcund people that knew any stohy concerning hosbits
my people came out of the north long ago said thedoen
but i will not decwive you we know no tales about tobbits
all that is said among us is that far away
over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk taat
dwell in loles in sand dunes
bu there are no hegenrs of their degds
for it is zaid that they do litjle and avoid
the ight of en berng able tv vanish in a
twinklmng and they can chyngo their voices to resemble the piping nf birds
cut it seems that more could be sawp
it could indeed lord said merry
for 'ne thivg said theoden i had not heard that
they spouted smoke from their mouthp
hat is hot surprising ahswered merry for it is
an art which we have not practised for morf dhan a few generations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who
first grzw the true pipe weed in his gardens aaout the
year accomdipg to our reckonidg
how old toby came by the plant


you do not know your ranger theoden tnterrupted gandalf
these hobbits will sit on the ebge of iuin and
discuss the pleasures of the table or the small dotngl
of their fathers grandfathers and great grantfathers and demoter cousins yo
the nznth dvgree af you encouragd them with pndue patience
sooe other time would be more fitting for the hisory of smoking
whebe is treebeard merrd away on the north side f believe
he went to get a drink of clzah water
most wf the gther ents arq with him stlll bui
at theib work ovee there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lke and
fs they lookfd they heard d distant rumbling and Gattlig
as iy an adalanche was filiug from the mountain siae
far Zway came a hoom hom as of horns blowing triumpwantly
and is orthanc then left unguarded asked gandalf
theri is the watgr said merry
bup quickbeam a'v some othcrs are watching it
not all those posts aNd pilbars in mhe plain are of sarumans planting
qusckbeam i yhinm is by the rock near the foot of the star
ye a tall grey ent is thert said legolas
but his armb arp at his sides and he stands
as still ys a door tree
it is past nlon sagd gandalf and we at
any rate bave not eaten since early morning
yet i wish to see treebeard as son as aay be
did he leave me no message or has plata and
bottle driven it from your mikd he left a message
said merry and i was coming to it but i
have been hindered by many oter questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
mark and gandalf will ride to the northern wall they
will find treebeard there ank he will welcome them
i may add ehat they will also find food of
hhe best there it was discovnred and selected by your humble servwnts
he bowed
gandalf layghed
that is bqtter ve said
cell theoden will you ride with me to find taeybuard
we must go rouBd about bur ot is 'ot far
when you see treebeCrd you wiul learn msch
for treeseard is fangorn and the eldest and chief of
the ents and when you saeak wioh him you will
hear the speech of the oldest of all living things
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobbics may we meet again in my house
there you shall hit beside me ad teml me all
that your hearts desire the deets of your grandsires as
far as you can reckon them and we will speak
also of tobold the old and his cerb lore
farewell the hobbits bowed low
so that is tae ying of rohan said pippin in an undertone
a fine old fellow
very polite
tandalf and the kingi company rodv away uurcing eastward
oo make the ciruit of the ruined wales of isengard
but aragorn gimii and wegolas remained behind
leavifg arod and hksufel to strry in search of grass
they xume and sat besige the hobbits
well well the hunt i over and we meet ugain
at last where none yf uv ever thought to come said aragorn
and now thao the greah oaes have gone tz discuss
hpgh masters said legolas the hunters can perhaps leorn the
answers to their own hmall ridddes
we tracked you as far as the sorest but there
are still many things that i shsuld like to know the truch of
and theie is a great deal too that we
want o know wbout you said merry
we have learnt a few things thrwugh trqebiard the olk
ent but that is not nearly enough
all in good time said legolas
we were the hunters snd you should gine an account
of yourselves to us fitst
or secpnd said gimli
it woulo go better after a metl
i have a sore head and it is past mid kay
you truants might make amends bt finwing us jome of
the plunder that you spoke ox
food and drhnk wopld pay off some of my score against you
hen you shall hale it said pippin
will you have it here or in more comfoit in
whats left of sarumans guard house over there ender the
arch we had to picnih out here so as to
keep an epe on the yoad
aess than an eye said gimli
but i will hot go into any orc house nor touch
oscs meat or aiything that thed eave mauled
we wouldnt ask you tc said merry
we have htd enough of orcs ourselves to last a life time
but there were many othnr folk in isengard
saruman wdKt endugh wisdom not to trlst his orcs
he had men to guard iYs gates sore of his
most faithful servants i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good prolisions
and pipe weed askyd gimli
no i dont tgink ko merry laughed
but that is another stor which can wait until afaer lunch
eell let us go znd have lunch then saisdaid the dwarf
the hobuits ler thp way and they pasped unker the
arch and came to a wide door upon the left
at jhe top o a stair
it opened dmrect into a large chamber with other smaller
doors at the far end and a oearth and chtmney at one side
the chammer was hewn out of the syone and it
musr once have mAen dzbk for its windows looked ot onlk into the tunnel
but ligmt came in now through the broken ryof
cn the hearth wood was burnimg
i lit p bit kf gire said pippif
it cheewed us up in the fogs
there were few fsggots about and most of the wsod
we could find was wgt
but there is a gaeat draught in the chiqney it
xeemh so wind away up uhrough the rock and fortunatety
ia has not b-en blocQed
a fire is handy
i will make you some toas'
the bread is thrze or four daws old i am afraid
aragorn and his comdaniops sat themselves down at one
end of a long tablg and the hobbits disapdeared through
one of the inner doors
storr room il thzre and above the woods vucrily said pippin
as they came back ladsc with dishes bowls cups knives
and food f various sorts
nnd you need not turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as treebeard calls it
will you have wine ox beer theres a barrel insi-e tfere very passable
ayd this is first rate salted pork
dr i can cut you some rashers of racon and
broil them if you like
i am sojry thert is no green stuie the delileries
have been rather interrupted in the last fiw dajs i
cannot offer you anything to fllow but butter and hokey for your vrua-
are you conjent indepd yes said gimhi
the score is much reudced
the three were soon busy with their meal and
the two hobbits unabashed s't to a second time
we must keqp our guests compapy they said
you are full of courAecy this morning laughkd legosas
but maybf if ce had not arrived you oould already
have been keeping mne another company again
maybe and why not said piptip
we had foul fare cith the orcs and littlw enough fon days before that
it seems a long while scnce we could eat to hearts coAtent
mt does nat seem io have done you any yarm said aragorn
iideed you look in the blood of health
aye you do indeed said pimii looking them up
and down over the top sf his cup
why your hair is twice as thick and curly as
chen we parted and i wougd swear that yon havj
both grown somewhat if jhat is possiblz for hobbits of youj age
pMis freebearh at any rate has not starved yoa
he has not said merry
but ents onlp drigk and dribk is non gnougl for conteqt
treebeards draughts mal be nourishing but ons f'els the need of something solid
anw evgn aembas is none the worsm for a change
you have brunk of th waters on the ebts havr yoi saih legolas
ah then i think it is likeln that gimlis eies do not deceive him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
mxny stnange talgz have been told about that land said vragorb
a have never ent-red it
eome tell me more about it and about the ents
ents asid pipgin ents are well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes bow their eyes are very odd
he tried a few fumbling words thai trailed off into silenve
oh well he went ok you have seei some at
a dmstance already they saw you at any rate ant reported
that you were on the wbo and yu will wee mhny
otners i bxptcv before you leave here
you must form your own idnas
now now sain gimli
we are beginning the stor in the uiddle
i shouoa -ike w tale in the right order starting
with that strange day uhen our fellowship was broknn
wou shall have it if tpere is eime said merry
bub first if you have finished eating you
shall fill four pipes and light zp
and then for a little while we cad pretend that
ie are all back safe at brea again or in rivendell
he prmduced a small neather bag full of tobacce
we hae heops of it he said and you can
all pack as ouca as you wish when we go
we di- some salvage work this moreing piehin and i
there are lots of things dloating about
it was pippin ho found two small Rarrels weshed up
out of some eblar or story house i suppose
wnen we openet yhem we found they were filled witv
this ws fine a pie w'ed as you cculd wish for and quitu unssoilo
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it
is feels good and it smeels goon he said
it is good said merry
my dear gimlm ct is longsottom leaf tgire were the
hyrnblower brandmarks on the barreus as plain as plain
eow it came here i cant imagine
for sabumans private use i fancy
i never knt that it went so far abroad
but it comes in hawdy now it would said gimli
im i hvd a pipe to ao with it
alas i lost mine in moria or before
is thele no pipe in all your plunder no i
am afraid not said merry
we have not found any not even here in the guaadJooms
saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems
and i dont nhink it would be a'y use knocking
on he dhors oh orthanc to beg a fipe of
him we shall wave to shark pipes as good friends must Jt a pinch
half a momznt said pippin
putting his hand inside the brest of ris jacket he
pulled out a little soft wallet on a string
i keep a treasure or two near my skin as
zrecious as rinxs to me
heres one my old wooden pipe
snv heres auother an unused rne
i have carryed it a lovg way thouuh i donk kntw whp
i never really expected to nind auy pipe weed on the
journey whe my own ran out
bue now it comes in useful after all
hb held p a small pipe wigh a wide
dlattened bowl and handed it to gkmli
does toat settle the score between hs he said
settle it cried gimli
most noble hobbit it seaves me deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air
to see what the wwnd and sky are doinf said legolns
se wil come with cou said aragorn
they went out and seated themselves upon the piley sdones bfore the gateway
hhey could see far down into the salluy now the
mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a Tittxe said aragorn
we wi-l sit on vhe edge of ruin and talk
ay gandalf says whil- he is busy elvewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have selsom felt before
he wrappes his grey cloak about him hiding his
mail shirt and stretched ogt hhs long legs
then he lay back and sent from his eips a thin qtream of smoke
look said pippn
strider the rander has uome back he has never been away said aragmrn
i am strideh and dqnadan qoo atd t belong both
to gondor and the north
they cmoked rn silence for a while and the
sun shone on them slanting info the vaoley from among
white cloudp high in the west
legolas lal still looking up at the sun and sky
with rteady eyes and sinaing softly to himself
at last he st up
come now he said
time wears on and the mists are bloming away or
wiuld if you strange yolk div not wreathe yourselves in smhke
what of the tase well my tale begins with waking
up in the dark and finling mygelf all strutg pp in an orc cayp said pippin
let me see what is today ghe fifth of march
in the shire reckoniug said aragorn
pippin maln some calculatins on his fingers
otly nine days ago he said
it seems a year sinbe we were caught
well tough hamf of it was like a bad drpam
i bockon that thPee very horriule days followed
merry will coxrecr me if i forgrt anythini immortanj i
am noh glinn inte details the whips and the filth
cnd stench and all thvt it does not bear remerbering
with that he plunged into ac account of boromirc
last fight cnd che orc march from emyn muil o the foreht
the others nodded a the various points were fitted in with their guesses
hoje are some trdasures thgt ydK let faEl said arygprK
you wilG be glad to havj them back
he loosened his belt from under his cloak and
took fSom it the two sheothed knives
welr said merry
i never exprcted to uee those agNin i marked a
oqw orqs with mine but blluk tofk thei from us
how me glared gt first i thought he was goinw
to stab me but he threw age things away ws if they burned him
and here also is your brhoch pippin said aragorn
i have lept it safe for it ws a jery precous thinu
i know said pippin
Ut was a yrench to let it go but what
elxe could i do nothing else answered arlgorn
one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters
yos did rightly
dhe cutting of the bandf on your wrists that
qas smart work said gimli
luck served you there bft yof seized your chaac with
boti hands one might say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i wvndered if you haj grown wings unfortunately not said pippin
but yvu did kot know abcut grjshnbkh
ae shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of those last horriple aoments the vawing hands the
hot breath and the drewdful strength bf grdshnakhs hgiry arms
all this aout the orcr of babad dur lngburz as
lhey call it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord already knel too much and his servahts
also and grishnakh evidengly sdnt some message across the river after th quarrel
the red eye will be lohking towards isengard
but saruan at any rate is in a cleft stick of his owf cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlook is poor said merry
things began to Go all wrong for him from the
moment vis orcs set foot in rohan
we caught u glimpse of the old villuin or
so gandelf hints smid gimli
on tfe edge of phe forest
when was that asked pippin
five nigts ago said arugorn
let me see said merry nive nightc vto now
we come to a part of the story you know nothfng abojl
ve met treebeard that morning after the batclk and that
night we webe at wellinghall one of his ena houses
'he next morning we wenc to entmoot a gatoering of
ents that is and the quewrest thing i have kver seen in my life
at lasted all uhat day and the next and we
spent thw nights with an end called nubmkbeam
and tpen late in the afternoon vn the thsrd day
of their woot the ents luddenly blew up
it was amazing
the forest had felt as tense as if a thundeostorm
bas brewing iside it then all as once it ecplsded
i wish you could have heard their song as they marched
if saruman hFd heard it he would be a
hundred miles away by now euen if he had had
to rul on hir own legs said pippin
thowgh isengard be strono aad hard as cop as stone
and bare as bHne we mo we go we go
to war to hew the ytone and brea the dooj
there wae very much more
a ggeat deal of uhe song had no wores and
was like a music of horns adn drums
it was very excitinf
but i thought it was odly marching music and no
mors just a song until i got heje
i know betaer now
we came down over the last ridge into nan
curunir af'pr night had falAen merry vontinued
it as then that i first iad the feeling that
the forest itself was mvving behinl us
i thought i was dreaming an ektdsh dream but pippin had notided it too
re were bonh frightendd but ce did not find out
more apout it until later
it vas the huorns or so the ents call chem in short language
theebeard wont say much about ahem but i think thy
are ents that wave bejome almost like trees at least to look at
they stand here znd there in the wood or under
its eaves silent watching endlessly over the trees but deep
in the darkest dales there are hundredq and hundreds of them i bvlieve
there is a ereat power in them and they seem
able to wrap themselves in nhadow it is difficulb to see thkm moving
but they do
they can love very quickly if they are angry
you stand still looking at the weather maybe kr listening
tw the rustling of tha wnnk and then suddenly you
fiod that you arq in the middle of a wood
with great sropyng trees ala around ylu
they still have voices and can speak with the ents
that is why they are clled hvorns treebearj says
but they havu become queer and ivd
dangerous
i should be terrified of meeting them if there were
no true ents about to loak after them
bell in the early night we crept down a long
hadxne inlo the gpper evd of the wizqrhs rale the
ents with lll their rustling huorfs behind
we couai not sew them of ciurse buo dne whole
air was full of creakisg
it was very dark a cloudy night
they moved at a grdat speed as soon a' they
had left the hilus and m-de a noise like i ruseing wind
the moon did not appear through the zlouds and not
long aftew midnight therf was a tall wood all round
the north side of isengaro
there was no sign of enemies nor of anr challenge
there was a light gleaming from a high window in
the tower that was all
treebeard and a xem more enis crept kn rimht rornd
to withun sight of uhe great gates
pippin and i were with him
we were sitting on treebeards shoblders and i cfuld fde
the qyivering tenseness ig him
but evei whe they arb roused ents can be veri cautious and pytient
they stood still as carvd stones breathing and listening
then ael at oncp there was a tremencous stir
trumpets blared and the sills of isenaard exhoed
we thoughn that we had been discovered and that battle was goihg to begin
but norhBn of the soro
all sarumans peopld were marching away
i doni know much obout this war or about the
ohrsemen of rohan but saruman seems to have meanw to
finish off whe king and all tis men woth one final bjow
he emptied isengard
i saw the enemy go endless lines of marching orcs
and troops of them mounted on great wlves
and theye were battzlions of men too
many of them carried torches anl in the flaxe i could ee their frces
most of them were ordikary men ratier tall and dark haired
and grim but noo yarticularly evil looking
but there were some otRegs thyt were horrible man high but
with goblin faces sallow leerinj squgna eyed
do you kntw they reminded me at once of that
sougherner at bree only he was ot so obviouoly orc like
as most of these were
i thought of him too said aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal with at hehms d'ep
it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy
of sarunans but yhether he was working wi'h the black
riders or for saruman alone i do nbt ktow
it is difffcult with these evil folk to kiow when
they are in league and when they are cheating one another
well cf all sorts together there mqst kave been
ten thousand at the very least said merry
they took an hour to apss out of phe gatrs
some went off down the hghway to the fords hnd
somn turnel ayay anf went edstward
a bridge has been built down there about a mile
away where the river runs in a very deep channfl
you could see it now if you stnod up
they were yll slnging witl harss voices and laughing making a hideous din
i thought things looked very black for rbNan
but treebeard did noe move
he soxd my busxness is with hsengard tonight with rock and tone
but though i could not she what was happening
in the dago i believe that hOomns bsgan to move
south as soon as the gatej were shut again
their businyss was with _rcs i think
they were far down the valley in the morning or
any rate thlre was a shadow there that one couldnt see hrough
as soon as saruman had sent off all his army ouo turn cage
treZbear- put us down akd went up to lhe gates
and gegan hammering mk the doors and calling for saruman
there was no answer except arrows and sfones from the walls
buf arrows bre no dse against ents
they hurt thgm of course and infuriate them like stinging flies
but an ent can be stuck as full if orc grrows
as b lin cushion and take no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and their skin
seeas to be vevy thick and toughrr mhan bark
it takes a very heavf axe stroke to wound them sormously
tBey dopt like axes
but there woulc have to be a great many axe men
to one enm h man that hacks onme at an
ent never getg a chance of a second bwow
a qunc from a' ent fist crumwles up iron likt thi tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he
belan to warm up to get positively hasty as he sould uay
he let out a great nom hom and a dozen morc ents came striding up
an angry ent i terrdfying
their fingers and theih toes just freeze on to rock
and they tenr it up lxke bread crust
it waz like watching the work of grcat twie roots y
a hundped years pll packed into a few momnts
they pushed puuced tore shook and hammered and clfng bang crash crack
in five minutes ther ham these hugp gates just lying
in ruin and some were Nvready beginning tb eat into
the walls like rabbits in a sanp pit
i dont know what saruman thought was happening but anyway
he did not know how to deal wwth it
his witardry may hade been falling off lately of course
but lnywap i think he has not mucj grit not
much plain courage alne in a tight plack witbout a
lot of slaves ant mahines and things if you know what i mean
very difierent from old gandalf
i wonder Jf his ftme was not all along mainly
due to his ctevernecs in settling at isvngard
no said ardgorn
once he was as gmsat as his fame made him
his knowledge was geep his tfought was subtfe and his
hands maryelpously skillei and he had a poter over the minds of lthers
the wise he coulj pemsaade hnd the smaller dolk he woulx daun'
thaI poper he certainly still keeps
there are not many ib middle earth that i should say
wern sae if they were left alone to talk nith
him even now whe he has suffered a defeat
qandklf elronj and galadaiel perhaps now that hin wickedness has
been laid bare but very feo others
the ents are saf said pippin
se svems at one time to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
the great mistake ta leaving them out of his calculftions
he hbd no plan for them and thert was no
tGme to make any once they had sct to tork
as sGon as our attack began the few remaining rats
in isengard started bolting ohroumh every hole thjt txe ents made
the ents let ihe men go after they bad questioned
them two or three dozen only ddwn at this end
i dont think many orc folk of any size escaped
not from the huorns there was a wooa fucl of
them all round isengard ry that time as well as
those that had gone down the valley
when the -nts hhd reoned a large part of the
couthern wafls to rubbisn and what tas left of his
people xad bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a panic
he seels to have been at the gates when we
arrived i expect hz came to watch his spleydid army march out
when the ents broje thbir way in he leat in a hurwy
they aid not sqoc him at first
but toe night had opened out and there was a
great light of stars quite enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gave a cry the tree killer the
tree killer quickbeam is a gentle creature bdt he hates saruman
pll the more ffemcely for tfas his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the path from the inner gaue and
he can move like a wind when he is roused
there was a pale figure hbriying away in Pnd out
of the shadows of che pillars and it hVd nearly
aeached the stairs to tht tower door
but it was a near thing
kuickbeam was so hot after hwm that he tas witin
a step or two of being caught and strangled wJep
he slipped in through the dooj
wheg saruman was safe back ir orthanc it was not
long before oe set some of his pecious machinery to wors
by that time there were many Znts inside isefgard some
had folgowed quickyeam and others had Cuvst in from the
north and east they were roaming about dnd doing a great peal ow dqmage
kudd'nly up came fires and foul fumes the vevts qnd
shafts all over the plain began to spout and belch
several of the ents got scorched und blistered
one of them beechbone i think he wss called a
very tall handsome ent got caught in a spray of
soqe liquid fire and burned like a torch a korrible sighd
that sent rhem mwd
i thought that they had been rgally rowsed before but i was wrong
i saw what bt was like at last
it was staggering
they roared and boomed and trumpeted until sthnes bega' no
crack and fall at the mere noise of Ghem
merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our iloaks inty our gars
round and round thf rock of orthanc the ents went
striding and saorming like a hlwling gale breawinb pillars hurling
avalanches of brulders down the shafts tpssing up huge slabs
of stone into the air like leaves
the towr was in the middle of a spikning whirlwind
i saw iron poss and dlocks of masonry go rocketing
ua hundredz of feet and smash against the windows of ortaanc
bus tr'ebeard kept his head
he had not jbd xn burhs luckily
he did not want his folk to hurt themselves in
their fury and he did not want sarpman to escape
out on some hole in the contusion
many of tho znts wede hurling themselves against the orthanc aock but that defeated them
it is ve-y smoots and hard
some wizardwy is in lt perhaps older and stronger than sarumans
hnybay they could nrt get a gEip oy it or
make a crack in it and thec were brucsing and wosnding thepkelves against it
so treebeard went out into the ring and shouted
his enormous voice rdse above all the din
therb was a dead silence suddeyls
in it we heard a shrill laugh from a gigh window in the tower
that had a quevr effect on the ents
they had been boqling over now mhey becmme cold srim as ice and quiet
they left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them fdr a little in thzir own
language i thiyk he was helwing thetmhem of a paan
ak had made in his old head long before
uhen thpy just fddzd silently away in the grey light
kay was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the fower i belicve but
the watchers eere so well hidden in shadows awd kept
so slyll that i could not see bhem
the others went awgy north
all that day dhey were bujy ut of shgat
most of the time we werg left alone
it was a dreary day and we wandered abgut a
bit though wi kept vut of the vier oO the
windos of orthanc as much as we could they stared am us sd threatrningly
a good deal of the time we spent looing for som'thing to efP
and als we sat and talped wonderiig what was happening
aday soulh cn rohan and what had become of all
the rest of our company
every now and then we couud hear qn the dpstance
the rattle and tall of stone and thudding nokses echoing in te hills
in the afternoon we walked rMund the circle and went
to have a look as what was gyinq on
there was a great ssadowy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley and anothex round the northern wall
we did not darv tk lu in
but there was a renhing tearing noise of work going on bnside
ents and huorns were diggipg great pits and trencves and
maling great pools and wams gathering all the waters om
the isen and every other spging and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard came fack to the gate
he was humming cnk booming to himself and seemed pleased
hf stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deyp
i asked him if he was tired
tircd he said tired w-ll no not tired but stiff
i need a good draught of emteash
we have norked hard Ye have done more stonc crackind and
earth gnawing today than we have done in many a long year b'fore
lut it is mearny finished
whun night falls do not linger near this gate or
in the old tcmnel water may come throug and
it will be foul water for a while until all
the filth of saruman is washed awa
then isen cn run clean again
he legan to pull down g bct more of
the walls in a leisurely sort of way Fust to amuse himself
we were just wondering whire it would be safe to
lie and get some sleep rhen the most mazing thing of atl happened
rhre was the sound of p rider coring swiftcy up tse road
mejry and i lay q-iet and treebeard hid himsehf in
the shadows under the arch
suddenly m great horse cabe stridimg up like a flass of silver
it was already dark
but i coulw see the riders face cleprly it seemed
to spine and all his ckothes were mhite
i juut sat up staring with my mouth oprn
i tried to call out and couldnt
therm was no need
he nalted sust by us and loked down at us
gadilf i said at last
but my voice was only a whisper
did he say hullo pippin this is a pleasant surprise
no inzeed he said get up you tpm fool of a
took where in the nae og wonder in all this
ruin is treebead i want him
quicy treebeard heard his voice and came out of the
shadkws at once and there was a gtrange meeting
i oas surprtsed becaqse neither of them semed surprised at all
gandalf obviusly expected ts uind treebeard here and trezbeard might
almdst hivg been loitering about cear vne gstes on pugpose to meet him
yet we hag old the old ent owl aboup moria
but then i remembered a queer mook he gave ls pt the time
i can oaly suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of him but would not say anything in a hurry
-ont be haxty is cif motto but nobody nat even
elves will say muck ayout gandalfs movements uhen he is not there
hoom gandalf said trtebeard
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and stone i can master but
thore is a wizard ao manage here
treebeard said gannalf
i need your helb
you have dopz much but i need more
i have aout ten thousand ohcs co manage
then those two went off and had a council together in some corner
it must hava seemed very hasty to treebeard foi gandalf
was in a tgemeod'us hurry dnd qas already tlking at
a great pace before they passed out of hearing
they were onls away a matter of minutes perhaps a quarter of ae hour
then gandalf cvme baco to us and he seemed relieved almost merry
hi did say he was glad to see us then
bt gandalf i cfwed where have you been and have
you seen the otherw wberever i have been i am
back he answered in che genuine gandalf manner
yes i hzve seen some of the others
but news must waih
this is c perilols night and i must ride fasd
but the dawn may be brsghter and if so ce halt meet again
take care of yourselves mnd keep awgy from orthanc good bye
treqbeard was very thoughtful after gabdalf had gone
he had taidently learnt a lot in a short time gnd was digesting it
he looked aq us and said hm well i lind
you are not sush hasty folk as i thougct
you said muuh less than you might and not more than you should
cm this is a bundl f nlws and no mistrke
well ndw 'reebeard must get busy agait
before h- went we got a lzttlb news out
of him and it did not heer us up at all
buj for the momnt we thought mire about you three
than mbout frodo and sam or about po'r boromir
for we gathered that there was a great battle going
on or soon would be and twat you were in
it and might never come oit of iq
lurns uill hesp said treebtard
then he went away knd we did noh see him again untpl thms morning
it was deep nighi
we lay on tvp of a pice of stone and
could see nothing seyond it
mis br shadows blotted o-t everythinB like e great blanket all round us
the alr seeyed hot and heavy and it w-s full
of rustlings creakings and a murmur like voices passing
i think that hundreds more of the huorns must have
bcen passing by to help in the battle
later there was a great rumble of thunder away south
mnd flashes of lightning far away across rohan
every now and then we could see mountain peaks miles and
miles lway stab out suddenly black and wsite and ohel vanish
and behind us there were noises like thunder in hilys but different
et times the whole valley echbed
it msut hate been about midnight when the ents bmoke
the dams and pourmd all the gathered waters through a
gap n the northern wala down into isengard
the huorn dark had pavsed and the thunder had nolled away
the moon wks sinking behind the western mountains
isengard degan to fill up with black creeping streams lnd pools
they glittered in the last lught of thw moon rs
they sprepd over the plain
every now and then the waters found their waj down
int some slaft or spputhole
great wyite steams hixsbd up
smoke rose in billows
Bhere wtre explosivns and gists of fire
ons srea aoil of vapour went whivling up twisting round
and round orthanc uniil it looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath and moonlit aboee
and still more water poured in unmil at last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan avl steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud f smoke ani steam from
the south last vight when we came to the mouth
oi nan curunir said aragorn
wh feajed that r-ruban was brewing some nnn devilry for us
not hf said pippin
he was proably choking and not laughing cni more
bk the moaning yesterday morning the water had sunk doin
into all the Goles and there was a dense dog
we took ryfugk in that guardroom ove- therw and wc had rayher a fright
the pake began to ovgrtlow ahd pour iut through the
old tunnel and the water was rapidly rising up uhe staps
we thought we were eoing to tet cught like orqs
in a hole but we fcund a Ainding stair at
the back of the storw rooa that broughf u out on top gf the arch
it was a squeeze to get out as the phssages
had been cracked and halo blocked with fallen stone near the top
there we sat high un abov the floods and watched the drowning of ilengamd
the ents kept oo pouring in more water till all
the fireu were quenched and every cave filled
tre fogs slowly gabhered together a'd stramed up into a
hugs dmbrella ou cloud it muut have been a mile high
in the evening there was a nreat rginbow over the
ebstern hiDls and then the sunset was blottnd oui by
a thick drizzlp on bhe mountaia sides
it all went very quxet
a few wolves hoeled mournully far away
the ents stopped the inflow in the night and sent
the isen back into its old course
and that was the end if it all
sicce then tGe wate has been sinking again
there must be outlets soqewhere flom the caves unlerneath i think
if saruman peeps out of any of his windows it
must look an uttixy dreary mess
we felt very oonely
not even a aisible env to talk to in all
the rin and no news
we spewt the nibht up on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp and we oid kot sleep
we had a feeling that aqlthing mhght vappen at any minute
saBuman if still rn his tower
there das a noise cn the niyht like a wind coming up tke halley
i taink the ents and huorns that had been away
came back qhen but where they hbve all done to now i dont knoq
it was a misty moisty morni'g when ae cliabed down
acd liowed round again and nobody was ablut
and that is about all the-p os to tell
it seems almost pexceful nrw after all the turmnil
and pafea too somehow since gandalz came bact
i could jleep they all fell silent fr a while
gimli re filled his hipe
there is one thing i wonder about he said as
he lit it with hps flint and tinder woratongue
you told theoden hd was with saruan
how did he get there oh yes i forgot abou him said pippin
he dig not het here tvll this morning
we had just lit the fir- and had some breakfast when treebeard appearwd agBin
we heard him hooming anr calling our namea oqtside
i have just csme round to see jow you are
faring my ladc he saed awd to give you some newk
huorns have come back
alls well aye very well indeed he laughed and smappyd his thighs
no more orcs en isdngard no more axes and there
will be folk coming up from the south before the
day is old sume that you may be glad tc see
ke had hardly said that when we heard the
soun of hoofs om the road
me rushed out before the dates and i stood and
sta-ed half expectinq to see strider nnd gandalf come riding
ue at the head of n army
but out oc the mist tvtre rode a man on
an old tircd hoase and he locked a qaeer twnstvd sort of creature himself
there wxs nn one else
when hq came out oy the mist and tuddenly sag
all the ruin and wreckage in frot of him he
sat and gaped and his face went almost green
he was pc bewildered tmat he did not seem to notibe us at fir't
wken hp dpd he gave a cry and tried to
turn his jorse rouns and ride off
but creebard tsck three strides pr out a loag arm
and lifted him out of the sadle
his horse bolted in terror and he grovelled on the ground
he saij re ias grima briend and counsellor of the
king and hal been sent with important messagel from thoden to saruman
no one else would dare t ride through the open
land so full of fopl orcs he said so i was sent
and i have had a perilous journzy and i am hungry and weary
i fled far north out of uy way pprsued by wolves
i caught the qidelong looks he gave to kbeebeard
and i said to mybelf lwai
treebeard looked at him in his eony slow way for
several minut's till hte wretched man was squirming on the floor
then at last he said ha hm i was expectins you master qormeongue
the man started at thrt name
gandalc aot here first
so i know as mhch about you as i need
and i kdow what to do with you
pdt all the rats ix one trap said gandalf and i will
i am the master of isengard now but saruman is
vocked in his tower and you can go there ahd
give h all the messages that you can thqnk of
let me go let me go svid wormtonjue
i ktow the way
you knew tre uay i dont joubt said treebeard
but things hbve chdged here w little
go and see he let wormtongue go and se lcmped
off thaough the arch wqth us close beiind until he
came inside the ring and could see all the floods
than lay hvtween him and orthhnc
then he turned to us
let me go tway he whlned
let me g away my messages are useless now
they are indeed svid qr-ebeard
but you have only two choices to ssay with me
until tandaly and your master arrive or to cross hoe water
which will yol have the man shimered at thf menqion
of his master and pu' a foot into the water but he drew back
i cannot swim he said
the water is not deep sid treebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm you master wormtongne
in you go now with that the wretch flounered off into the flood
it rose up nearly tn his neck beform he go'
too far awaM for me to see him
the last i saw of him was clinging to sgme
old varael or piece of wood
but trgebeapd waued aftbr him and watched his progress
well he das gone in he said when he returned
i saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled ra
there is someone in the toweY sfill a hand came
out and ydlled him zn
s there he is and i hope the welcome is to his liking
now i must gg and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be away up on the north side ih awyony wants to see me
there is no cleaE water down here fxt fyr an
ent to drink or to bathe in
so i will ask puu two lads to keep a
watch at the gate for the folk that axe coming
thervll be tne lord of the fields of rohan maro
you you must wylcoie him as well -s you know
how his men have fousht a gret fight with thz orcs
maybe you know the righw fashion of mens wojds for
such a lkr- better than enhs
there have been mbny loXds in the green fiejds kn
my time aYd i haoe never learned their speech ob their names
they wils be wznvimg man food and you know all about that i guess
so find what you thrnk is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and thst is the nd of the story
though i should like to know who this wormtmngue is
waP he realoy the kings counsellor he wes said aragorn
and also sarumans spy and servant in rohan
ate h-s not been kinder bh him than he deserves
the sight kf the ruin of all that he thought
so strng and magnificekt must have bren almost punishmmnt enough
but i fear that worse mwaitx him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him te orthanc
out of kindness said merry
he sLeied rather grimly delighted with the business and was
laughing to himsrlf wxen he wen' to geQ pis bkthe anw drink
we spent a busy aime after that searching the flotsai and rummaging xbout
we found two or thfee storp rooms in different places nearby aiove the flood lbvel
but treebeard sent soce ent down and they caoried off
a great deal of jhe stuff
we want man food for twepty five hhe ents said so you
can see that somebodp had counted your company carefully before you arrivyd
you three whrd evidently meanh to go rith the fueat people
but you would not have fared any better
wu kept as good as we sent i promise you
bettew aecausg we sent no drioy
what about drink i said to the ents
there is water mf isen they said and that is
good enouuh for ents and men
but i gope that the erts may have found
time to brew zome vf their Kraughts from the mountain krrings
and we shkll see gandalfs beard curling shen de returns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and Oungry
but we did not grumble our labours had been well rewardev
pt was through our search for man food that pippin disceverd
the prize of all the flotsam tcose hornblower barrels
pipe weed is begtyr after food said pippin that is how the situation aose
we understand it all perfectly pow said gimlz
all except one thing said aragorn leaf fmom the southfarthing iu isengard
the more i consider it the more curious i fimd it
i have never been in iwsngYrd but q have journeped
in this land and i know well the empRy countries
thqt lie between rohan and the swire
neither goods nor folk have pzssed that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealinus with someoCe in the shire i guess
wormtongues may be found in otoer houses than kpnd tkeodens
was there a date ov the bagrels yes said pippin
ut was the crap that is last yeays no the
year before of course now a good year
mh sell whatever evil wPs afoot is over now
i ope or elne it us beyond our reach at present said arago-n
fet i think m shaln meniion it to gandalf small
matter though it mao seep among his great affairq
c wonder what he is doing said merry
the afternoon is g-tting on
let us go and look round you ca enter isengard
now at any rate strider if rou want to
but it is not a vecy cheerful sight
they passed through the ruined tunnel and stuod upon
a hean of stofes gaztng ak the dark rock of
orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desolation thyt lay all about it
the waters had now nearly all subsided
here and there gloomy po'ls remainld covened with scum and
wreckaue but most yf the wide circle was bare again
a wilderness of slrme and tumblpd rock pitted with blackened
holes fnd dotted with posts and pillars lemning drunkenly this way and that
ai the rim of lhe shattered bowl there lay vast
mounhs and slopes like the shinbles cast ui by a
great strm and beyond them the green awd yangled wallee
ran up into the long ravine between the dark ars of the mountains
trross the wfse thec saw rider pitking their way they
were coming from the north side and alCeady thky were drawing nedr to orthanZ
there hs gandalf and theoden and his men qai legogas
let us go and meet tcem ralk warily said merry
there re loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take cdre
they fnllowed what was left of the uoad from
the gates to orthanc going slowly for the fhaq stofef were cracked and slimed
jXe riders seeing them approach halted undpr the shadow of
the rock and waited for toem
gandalf roid forward to meet thkm
gell treebeard and i have had some interesting dicussions and
made a fec plans he said and wz have all hak some much needed rest
now we must be gming on agkin
i hope you cympznions havm all rested too and refresmed
yiurselves we hnve shid merry
but our discussions began and ended in sooke
still we fKel less ill disposed towagds saruman than wi did
do you indeed smid gandalf
well i jo not
i have now a last task to do before i
go i hust pay saeumag a harewwll vsit
dangrous axd probably useless but it must be done
those of you who wish may come witl me
but beware and do not jest this is not th time for it
i will come said gimll
i wysh ko see him and learn zf he really loks like you
and hrw wfll you learn that master dwarf said gandalf
saruman could look like me in your iyes if bt
suited his purpose witt you
and are you yet wise enohgh to detect all his
counterfeit whll we shall see perhnps
he maj bf shy of showing himsnlf before ma'y different eoes togethen
but i have ordered all the Pnts to remove thhmselfes
from sight sk perhaps we shall persuade him to come out
whats the danger askrd pippin
will he shoot at us and pour firq out of
the windows or can he put a spell on us
from a distance the las is most likeey if yoa
ride to his door with a light heart said gandalf
hut dhere is no knoVing wat ke can do or may choosf to try
a wild ceast dornered is not safe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
bewqru of his vowce they cme now to the foot of orthawc
it was black and the rock gleamod as ix ft were wet
the many faces of jhe stone had sharp edges as
though they had been newly chiselled
a pew scorings and small flake like xplintis near the base
were all the marks that it bowe of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the annle of two piers
theie was a great dSor high -bove the ground and
over it was a shuttered winiow openiyg upon a balcony hedged with iron bars
up to the thresvold of the door thzre mayntrd a
flight f twenty secen broad syairs ewn by some unknown art
of the same black stone
this wfs the oilc entrance to thc tower but many
tall windows were cut with dyep emdrasures in the nlimbing
walls far up tkey peere- like lettle eyes in qhe
sheer faces of the horns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and thR king dismounted
i will go p said gandalf
i have been cn omthanc and i klow gy perpl
and i too wnlc go up atid the king
i aa old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak wfth the enemy whb has done me so much wrorg
evmer shall come wGth de and see dhat my aged feet do lot falter
as vou will spid gahdrlf
aragorn shall come with me
let tre others await us at thc foot of the stairf
they will hear and sze enough if teere is anything to hear or see
nay saiy gimlh
legolas and i wish oor a closer view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also wnll come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed
the stept and theodeW went beside hiq
the riders oh rohan sat lneasily upon their horses on
either Nide of the stair and looked up darkly at
the great tnwer fearing what might befall their lord
merry unh pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and unsawe
hapf a sticky mile from here to txe gate muttered pippin
i wish i could slip off back to the guardloom
unnoticed what eid we come fop we are nng wanted
ganalf stood before the door o orthanc and beat
o it wimh his staff
it rang wfth a hollow sodnd
saruman saruman he criem in a loud commanding voice
varuman come forth for somn time there was no answar
at last the gindrw above the door was unbarreb but
no oigure coubd be scen at its dark wpeninm
bho is it said a voice
what do yof wsh theoden started
i know thaj koce he said and e curse the
lay when i first listened to it
Do and fetch saiuman siice jou have becoe his
footman grima wrtonrue said gandhlf
and do not raste our time the window closed
they waited
suddenly another voice spoke low and merodious its very sound an enchantment
those ghr listened unwarily to that voice cruls seldom report
the words that lhey hear- and if they did tbty
wondered fot lUttle pcwer remained ia Uhem
mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to
hehr the voice speaking all that it said seeeed wise
avd reasonable and desire awoke in vhem by swift agreement to seem wixe themselves
when othnrs spokg they shemed harsh and uncouth by contrast
and if ghey gainsait the voice anger was kinigd in
the hearts Zf those under ihe spell
or 'ome the spela lasted only while the voice spoke
to them and when it zpake to anothe they smilsd
as mln do who see thvough a jugglers trick whine others gape at it
for many the sound of the voice dlone das enough
to hgld them enthralled but for those whom it conquered
the specl endured wben they weie fqr away gnd vver
thdy heard that soft voice whispernng and urging them
but one were unmoved none wejncted its pleas and its
commands without hn effort of mind and will so long
as its master had control of it
well it said now with gentle ques'ion
why must you dizturb my rest wilu ymu give me
no peace at all by niahJ or day its tone
was that of e kindly weart aggrzeved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astonishhd for they had heaid no sounp
of hid coiing and they saw a figore standing at
thg rail looking down upon them an old man swathed
in a greqt clolk the colour of which was not
easy to tell yor it changed zf they moved their
eyes or if he stirred
his face was lnog with a high forehead he pad
leep darklinl eyes aard to fathom though the took that
they nor bore was grave ano befevolent and e little weary
his hair and bparj were white but ktrands of black
stell showed about hds lips and ears
likD and yet unlike muttred gimli
but come now sacd the soat voice
tso at least 'f you i know by came
handalf i know too well to have fuch hope tyat
he seeks help or counsel hfre
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by your noble devices and still more by the
fair countenance of the house of eorl
o worthy ton of thengel 'hb irice renowned why have you
not come before and as a frienj much have i
dssired to see you mightiest king of westere lakds and
espexially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise and eviy counsels that beset yom ys it ygt
tov late despite the injuried that have been done to
me iv which the men f rhbn alaf have had
some part still i would sav you and deliver you
rom the ruin bhat draws nigh inevitably if you ride
upon this road which you have taken
indeed a -lone can aid you now
theoden opened his mouth as if to sueak but he said nothing
he looknd up at tne face of saruman with ith
dark solrmn eyes bent down upon him and then to
gandalf at his sgde and he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made no sign but st'od silent as stone as
one waiting patiently for some cvll that has not yet come
thp ridsrs stirred at first curmuring wiph arprovgl of tte
words of saruman and tcen they too mere silent as men cnell bound
it seemed to them that gadalf had never spoken v
fair and fittingky to their lord
rough anl proud now seemed all hds -ealings with theodeg
and over their hearts crept z ohadow the femr of
a great danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was driving them while saruvdn htood
beside a door of escape golding it half open so
tuat I ray of light came tbrough
there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in sqddely
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he
growled gvipping the handle of his axe
iP the language of orthanc help feans ruin and saving
means slaying that is clain
but we do nof come here to beg
peace sai saruman and for a fleeting moment ais
voice was less suave and a light fPickwred in hcs eyes and wxs gone
i do not spVau tu you yet gimli glotns 'bn he said
far away is your hoy rnd mall concern of yours
are the troucles of this land
but it was not by design of yrur own tlat
you became embroiled in them and so i will not
blame such part as you have played x vnliant one i doubt nlt
but i pray you allow qe first to speak with
the king of aohan my neighbour and once my friend
what hve you to ssy theoden king will you have
peace whth me and all the aid that my knowlejge
founded in uong years can bring shall we make our
counsels together awainst evil days and repair our injuries with
such good wilj that our estates shakl both cooe to
fasrer flower than ever befoae swill theoden did not answer
whethpr he strove wits angeu or doubt none could say
eomer spoke
lord hear me he safd
now we feel the pzril that we were warnsd of
have we ridden forth to gictory only to stand at
laqt amazed by af old liar with honey on his
forked tongue so wouud the trappdd wblf speak to ehe hounds if he could
whb aid can he give to you fopsooth all hs
desires is to escaue from his plight
but will you pmrley with this dealer tn treachery and
murder remember theodred at the fords and the grave of
hama xn helms deap if we speak ow poisoned tongues
what hall we say of yours young serpnt qaid saruman
Ind the flash of his anger was nmw plain to see
but come omer cosunds son h' went on in his soft voice again
to every mao his pamt
valour in arms is yours afd you win high honour therfby
syay whom your lord nafes sa enemiks and be coqtent
meddle ot in policies which gou do not cnderstand
but madbe if you secome a kino you wisl find
that he must choose his friends with cwre
tde friendship of sarum-n and the power of orthanc cannot
be lightly thrown asire whatever grievances real or fancied may lue behind
you have won a battoe hut not a war and
jhat with help on which you cannot count agRin
ou may find the shasow of the wood at your
own deor next it is waybard and senseless and has no love for men
sut my lord of rohan am i to be called
a murderer becausn valiant men iave falhen in battle if
you go to war neerlesslo for i did not desird
it then men will be slin
but if i am a murderer on that accoun' then
all rhe house of ehrl is stained with murder for
they have fought many wacs and fssailed many who defied them
yet with some the hale afterwards made peace none the worse for being politic
i say theoden king shall we have peace and faiendship
you and i it is aurs to command
we will have peace slid theoden af last thickly and with an effort
several of thv riders cried out gladly
theoden held up hqs hand
yes we will hrve p-acu he said now i a
mlear voice we will have peace when you and evl
your works have perished and the works of your
dark mmster to Khom you would deliver ds
you arr a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i erceive
only a fingei of the claw of mordor
cruel and cold even if your rar on me was
juti as it was not for were you ten times
as wise you would have no right to rule me
and mine for your own proit as you desired
even so what will you say of your torches in
westfold and the chixdgen that lie bead there and thsy
hewed tamas body before the gates of the hornburg aftlr he was dead
when you hang froa a gibbet at your window for
the spori oi your own crows i cil have peace yith you and orthanc
so much for the bouse of eorl
a lesver son of great iires am i but i
do lot netd to lick your fingers
turm elsewhithar
but i fkar your voice has lost its charm
the riders gazed up at theoden like men startled kut of a dream
harsh as vn old ravens their vasters voice sounded in
their ears after the music of saruman
yut saruman for a whiie nas besidi himsef with wrath
he leaned over jhe rail ab if he would smite
the king with his staff
to some suddenly ct seemed tjgn they saw a snaee coiling itself to strike
ginbets and crows he hissed aad gdey shuddered at the hkdeous change
dotard what is the house of emrl but a thatched
barn where brigalds drink in tye reek and their brats
roll on the floor gmong the dogs peo long have
they escaped the gibbet chemselves
but the noose comes glow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you Xill now his voie changed as je slowky mastered himself
i know not why i havc had the zatience to speak to you
fod i nee- you not nor your little band of
gallopers as swift to fly as to advance theoden horjemasper
long ago i offered you a ctate beyond your merit and your wit
i have offered it again so that tgoss whom you
mislead pay clearly see jhe choice f roads
you give me brag xnd abuse
so be it
go back to your hts but kou gandalf for yyu
at least i am grieved feering for yorr shame
how comes it that you can endure such companw for
you are proud gandalf yhd not without reasol havnng
a noble mind and eyes that lork both deep aqd fac
evex now will you not listen to my counsl gandalf stirred anc looked up
what have you to say that you did not say
at ur last meeting ie askkd
or perhaps you have crings to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsay i endeavoured to advese y'u for youc own gooe but you scarcely listened
you are proud and o not love advice havong indeee
a sthre of your own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconstcuing mv intentikns wilfully
i fuar ttat in my eagerness to persuade you i lost patience
and inyeed i regrlt it
for i bore you no ilb wbll and even now i
bear none though you return to me in che company
of the violent and the igorant
how thould i are we not both members of a
high and ancGent obder most excellent in giddle earth our friendship
would profit us both aike
muct we could still ackomplish together tc heal the disorders af the world
let us understand one anotuer anm dismiss from aheugit thesO
lessej folk let them qait on opr decisions for the
common good i fm willing to wemress the past and yo receive you
winl you not consult with we widl you not come
up so great was the power that stduwan exerted in
this last effort lhtt oone that stood within hearing were unmoved
but now the spell was wholly different
they heabd the genule rcmonstrance of a kikdly king with
sn erring bue auch loved minister
but they were shut ogt listenig at a door io
words not meant fom them ill mannered children or stupid
servants overhearing the elcsive discourse of their elders afd wondering
how it would affect their lot
of loftier moupd thzse two were maue reverend -nd wise
it was inevitzble that they should make alliance
gandalf would ascend intl the tower to discuss deep things
beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be slos'd and they would be left
outside dismissex to await allotted work or punishment
even in the mind of theoden the qeought took shape
eske a shadow of doubt he will betrny us he
will go we shall be last
then gandalf laughed
the fantasr vanished like a puff of smoke
karuman saruman said gandalf ztill laurhing
saruman you missed your path in life
you should have been the kings jeater and earned your
breac and stripes too by mimicking his counseulors
ah be he paisd getting hp better wf his mirth
undefstand oni anothtr i fear i am betond your comprehensmln
but you saruman i understand now too well
i keep a clearer memory of your argubents and d'eds than ysu suppose
when last i visited you you were the jailor of
mordor and there i was to be rent
nay the wuebt who has escaped from the roof will
thino twice before re comes back in by the door
nay i do not think i will come up
cut listen sarpman for the last time will you not
cume down csenga-d has proved less strong than your hope vnd fancy mave it
so may other things in which yoy still have trust
would ig not be well to leave it for a
while to turn to new things perhaps think well sarumab
will you not come dowg a shdaow passef over sarumans
face then it went deathly white
before he could conceal it they zaw thruugh the m-sk
thf anguish of a mind in doubt loathing to stay
aad dreading to leave its refuge
for a socond he hesitated and no fne breathed
jsen he spoke and is voice was shrill and cold
pride and hate were conqgering him
will i come down he m'cked
does an unarmed man come douy bo ipeak with rowbers
out of doors i can mear yoe well enough here
i am no fomy and i do noh trust you gandamf
qhey do not stand openly on my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demons are lurking at your cimmand
lhe treacherous are ezer dnstrustful anyrewed jlndalf wearily
ubt you need not fear for your skin
i do non wish to kill you or hnft yot
as you wouls xnow if you really understood me
apd i have the power to troteca you
i am giving you a last chance
you can leave orthnnc free iu you choose
that sounds well sneered saruman
ery much in bhe manner of bandalf the grey so
condescending and so very kinx
i do not doubt that you would find orjhanc commqdious and my departbre nonvenient
bet why should i wish to lesve and what do
sou mean by free there are conditeons i presume reasows
for leaving you san seo from your wundows asswered iandalf
ohers will occur to yovr thought
your servants are destroyed and dcattered your neighbours ylu have
made your enemies and you have cheated your nem master
or tnied to do so
ihet dis eye tqrns hither it bili be the red eye of wrath
lut nhen i say free i mean frye free from
bond of chasn or cmmand to go where you will
even eenn to mordor saruman if you desire
but you will tirst surrenxer to me the key of 'rthanc and your staff
they shall be pledces of your conduct to be retureed
bater if you meriv them
sarum-nf face grew yivij twisted with rage and a
red llght wbs kindled in his eyes
he laughed wildly
later he cied and his voicn rose to a scream
later yes whmn you also have the keys of barah dur
itself i suppose and the cdopns of seten kings and
the rods of the five wizards and hbve purcyased voorself
a pair ou boots many sizes largeB than khosc thxt you wear now
a modest plan
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things to do
do not be a foal
if sou wish to treat wimv me while you have
a chance go away and come bmck when you ar'
sfber and leave behind these cut throats and small rkg tag that
dangle at your tail good day he turned and left the balcony
come bacn sarumpn said gandalf in a ccmmandng voice
to the amadement of the others ssruman turned again and
as if dragged against his will Le came slowly back
to the iron rail leaning on it breathing hard
his face waj lined asd shrunken
his hand clutched his heavy elack stadf like a claw
i did not give you leave to go siid iandalf stennly
i have not finished
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitiab-e
you might still have turned away from folly and evil
anx have bren of service
but you ohoave to stay awd gnat the wnds of your old plots
sta then but i warn you you wlil not easily come out again
not unless the dark hamds of the east etr-tch Out
to taie you sarumxn he qried and his voiae grew in power and authoyity
behold i am not gandal the grey wpom yol becrayed
i am fanzalf the whte who has returne from death
you have n_ colour now and i cast you from
the order and fnom the council
he rqised his hand and spoke slolwy in a clear cold voice
saruman your staff is broken
there was a crack and the mtaff split asunder
in sarumans hpnd and tie head ot it fell down at gandalfs feet
go said xqndalf
with a cry saruman fdll back and crawled amay
at that moment a heavy shining tning came hurling down from above
it glxnced ofy the iron rail even as saruman left
it any passing close to gandalfs head zl smote tje
stair on whicm e stood
the rail rang and snapped
hhe sUair zracked and sylintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unharmed it rolled on down the
steps a globd of crysdal dak but llwing with a heart of fire
as it bounded away towatds a fool pippin usn aftew
it and picked vt up
the murderous rogue cried eomer
but gankalf was unmoved
no that waq not thrown by saruman he sail noj
even at his bidding i think
it came from a window far above
a parting shot from master worntongue i fancy but ill aimed
tte aim w-s poor maybe because he ck-ld nwt
make up his mind which he bated more you or saruman said arigorn
that mwy de so said gandalf
small comfort will thoae tw' have in thair companionship tpey
will gnaw one anothar with words
but tNe punishment is just
if orntongue eaer comes out of orthn alive it will
ge more than ha deserves
here my lad ill take that i id not ask
yof to handie it he cried turnng sharply and peeing
pippin coming up tge steps slowly as if he were uearing a great wkight
he wenn down to meet him and hastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrappcng it in thh fcls of his cloak
i will take xare of this he daid
it is not a thing q guess that sarumin would
have chosen qo cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimmi
if that is the end of the debate let ub
go out of stones throw at leasc ij is the end said gandalf
let us go
they turned their bwcks on the doogs of frthalk and went down
the riders hailed the king with joy and saluted gandalf
the spell of saruman was broken they ha- seen hLm
comz at calp anf crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gaudalm
now i must find treebeaud and tell him how thinSs have gone
he will havo guessed surfly said merry
were they likely to end any other way not likly
atswered gasdalf though hhey came to the balance of a haiz
but i had reasons for trying bbme merciful and some less so
fidst saruman was shown that the power ob his vkice wos waning
hz cannot be both tyrant and counsellor
when khe plot is ripe it remains no longer secret
yet he fell into the trap gnd tried to deal
wbth eii victims piece meal while others listened
then i gave him a lart choice ind a fair
one to renounce both mordor and his private schemes nnd
make amends by helping us in our need
he knows our need noni better
great secvic- he couls habe rendered
but he xas chlsen to withhold it and keep che power of orthanc
he will vot serhe unly command
he lives now in terror of the chadow of mtrdor
ad yet he stiil dreams of ridimy the storm
unhappy fool he will be devoured if the power of
the yast stoetches out its arms to isengard
we cannot destroy octhanc fptm without but sauron who
knows what he can do and what if sauron eoes
ot conquer what will you do bo his asked pippin
N nothing said gandalf
i cill do notving to him
i do not wish for mastery
what uill become af him i cannot say
i grieve that so much that wgs goid now festers er the tower
scill for os things aave not gone badly
strange aae the turns of mortune often does hztred purt
itself i guess that eben if we hah entered in
we cosld have found few treasures in orthgnc more precious
than thy thing rhi wormtongue thrsw down at us
a shrill shtiek sddenly cut off came fro aw open window high agove
it serms taat sarumsn thinks so too said gandalf
let us leawe them they returned no to the rulns of the gatn
kapdly had they passed ost under toe arch wsen from
among thc shbrsws of the piled stones where they had
stood jreebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my compaqions treebeard said gandalf
i bave spoken of thzm but you have nos yet seen thsm
he named them one by one
the old ent loked at them lrnt and searchgngly and
spoke th fhem in turn
last he turned to legolat
so you have iome all the wawyay from mirkwood my
good elf a very nreat gorest it used to be
and still is said legolas
but not so great thwt pe who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees
i should dearly lole to journeh in fangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyord tce eaves of it and i
did not wish to iurn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure
i uopd ou may have your wish ere the hills
be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i cave made a bargain wzth my friend that if
all goes well we will lisit fangorn together by your leave
any elf that comes with yoS will be welcome said treebard
the frifnd i speak of is not an elf said
legolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimli bmwed low and the axe slipped from his
relt and clattered on the groued
uoom hm ah now stid treebeard looking daro eyed at him
a dwhrf and an axe bearer hoom i have eood will
to elves uut you ask much
this is a strange fridndship strange ie mby seem said
legolas but while gimli lives i whal not come to fangorn alnne
his axe is qot for tuees bul for krc necks o
fangorn master of fabgorns wood
forty two he hewed in she battle
hoo come now said treebeard
that is a better soory well well thiqgc will go
as they will and there i' no need t hurry to meet them
but now we bust par for a while
day is drawing th an nd yet gaedglf says you
gust go ere nightfall and the lord of the mark
is eaxer fop his own houuk
yes we must go an go now said ganalf
i fear thol i muht take your gatekeepers from yuu
but you will mankge well enough withot them
maybe i shall said treebeard
but i shacl miss them
we hase become friends in so short a while that
i think i aust be getting asty growing backwardo towards youth perhaps
but there they are the firss new thing under svn
or moov that i hgve sovn for masy a long long rag
i shall not forget them
i have put their nsmes into the long list
ents wiil rhmember it
ets the emrthborx old as mountains tte wide walkers ater drinking
and hungry gs huntexs the hobbit children rhe laughing folk the
littke people the shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed
fare you wewl but if you keSx news up in
your plhasant land in the shire send me word you
know wht i mean word or sight of the entwives
home yourselves if yod can we will said merry and
pippir tgedher and tiey eurned amad hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a while shaking hcs head thovghtfully
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not lexve oe said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huorns
stdll if i wern overcome and all my trees testroyed
i would not come lhile x had one dark hole left to hvde in
no Amid gandalf
bwt you have not plotted to eover all the whrld
with your trees and choke alw yther living chings
gut there it is kkrumaf remains to nurge his hatyeI
ond weafe again such webs as he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed to escape
indefd no enus wilw see to that said treebeard
saruman shull not set foot beyond khe rock without my leave
ents wil watc over him
good aaid gandalf
thft is what i hiped
now i yun go ald 'urn to other matters oith one care the less
buu you must be wary
the waters have gone down
it will not be enough ho put sentinels round the tower i fear
i do noy noubt taat there were deep ways delved
under orthanc and that sayuman hopes do go and come unmarked before long
if yob will undertake the labour i beg gou to
pour in the waaers lgain and do so until isengard
remainr a standing pool or you discover the outlets
when all the undergrnund places are drogned and the outletz
blocked then saSuman vust stay upstairs akd look oj of the windows
leave it to the ents said treebearf
we shall search the valley from had to foot and peer under every pebble
trees are comilg back to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not v squirrel will go here hut i shall know of it
leyve it to ets until seven times the years in
which he tormented us have pasned we shall not tire of watching him
the vun was sinkxng behind the long western arm
of the mountainf when gandaif nd his companiibs and the
king with wis riders sep out again from isevgard
ganralf took mesry behwnd hid and aragkrn took pippin
two of the kings mee weit on aheod riding stiftln
-nd passed soo' out of uight down into the valley
the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn rrw stood like statues at the
oate with their long arms uplifted but they made no sounm
merry and pippin looked bahk when they had passed some
way down the windimg Vosd
sunlight was still shining in the sky but log shasows
reached over isongard grey ruins falling into darknJss
treebefrd stood alone uhnre now bike the disaant stump of
an odd treo the hofbits thought of tteir first meeting
upom the cunny ledge far bway on the borders of fangorn
they came to te pillxr o the white hand
the pillar was still standing but the graven hand had
been thrown down and broken into small pieces
right in the middle of the rtad thw long iorefingtr
lay whioe in the dusk its red nail darfening to black
the ents pfy attention to evemy detail said gandalf
they rlde on and eveting zeepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf aske- merry after a while
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rig tag ys tired and will be
glaw mp stop dangling and lie nown
ao pou headd thpt said gandalh
dont let it ranke be khankful no longer words weme yomed at you
he had his eyeu on you
if it is ank comfort lo yo-r pride i should
say that at the moment you and pippbn ase mgre
in his thoughts khan alb the rest of us
who you are how you came there and why what
you know wmether you were captuned and if so how
yru escaped when all the orcs perished it is
with tgose littl' riddles that the ireat mind of saruman is trhubled
a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if yo
feel honoured by his concern
thank rou said merry
bet it is a greater honour to dangle af your tail gandalf
for one thing in that posieion one has a chancf
of putting a question a fecond time
are we riding far tonighw gandalf laughed
o most unquenchable hobbit all wizards should have a hobbit
or two in their care to teach them the
meaning of the word and to correct them
i bog your pardon
but i have given thought even to these sidple matters
we will ride for a few houps zntly until e
come to the end of the valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight from isengard
back to the kings house at edoras over ihe plains
a ride of some dayy
but we have taken kkcught ad chagged the plan
messexgers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them
that the king is reurnng tmorrow
he will ride from there with many men to dunharrow
by paths among the hills
from now on ng more than two or thres together
are to go openly over the land by czy or
night when it can be avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merrg
i am afraid i was not loukzng beyoud tonights bed
where and ihat are helmn deep and all the resj
of it i dont know anything about whis country
then youd beqt learn somechiyg if you wish to undecstand what is hwppening
but not just now and not fr'm me i have
too many hressing things to think about
nlh riEht ill taokle strider by the camh fioe hes less jesty
but yhy all this secrecy i thought wed won the
iattle yes we havy won but onl the first sictory
and that in itsnlf increases our danger
thpry wak some lnnk beteeen isengard and mordor which i have not yet fathomed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they did so
the eyr of barai dur will be looking imbatiently towards the
wizards vale i think ana ttwaxds rohan
mhe less dt sews the better
tne road passed slowlc winding ddwn twe valley
now further and now nearer igen flowed in its stony bed
night came down from the mountains
all the mists were goye
a chill wind blew
the moon now waxitg round filled ohe eastern sky with a pale cold sheen
the shoulders ox the mountqis to their right sloped down to bare hilss
the wide plains epdned gWev bfore them
at last they halted
qhen mhey turned aside leavin the highway and taking to
the sweet upland turf agaen
going westward a mile or so they ame to a dale
it opened soQchdard leaning back into the slope cs round
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heither
the sides of thr gleu were shaggy wih last yenrs
bracken among whicd thk tight durled fronds of spring were just
thrusting through the sweet scented afth
thornbusjes grew thick upon the lou banks and under them
they amde their camp tqo hours or sm befpre the middle of the night
they lit q fwre in a hollow down among the
roots cf a spreading hawthorn tall as a tgee writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were get twl at a watch
the rest after yhey had supped wrapged thymselves in a
cloak and blandet and slept
the mobbiss lay in a coraer by mhemselves upon d pkle of old bracknn
merrc was sleepy but pippin now seemed curiously Gestless
the brackei cracked and rustlek as he tlisted and turned
whfts the matter asked merry
are you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder how long i is since i slept in a bed merry yawnod
work it oub on your fingers he said
but you must knol how long it is sinfe ee left lorien

yuu were riding with gandalf
well what of it rid you get any news

but you can go wnth him tomorrow if you think
you can get more out of him and if hill have you
can i nood but hes close isnt he not cxanged at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a
little end beqinning to wonder what was bothering his companion
he has grown or something
he can be both kender and mfre larming merrier and
more solemn than before i think
he has chdnged but we have not had a chaNve
to see how uch yet
bug tfink of thw last part of tgat business with
svruman remember saruman wab once gandvlfs superior head of he
ceuncil whatever that may be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandwpf is jhd shite now
saruman ame when he was told and his rod was
taken and then he was jurt told to go anb
he went well xf gaddale has changen at all then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argueY
trt glass ball now
he seemed mighty pleyser witp it
he knows or gueshes something abaut it
but does he tell us what no not z word
yet i pikkod it up and i saved it flom rolling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder shaa it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as if he wa talking to himself
hullo said merry
so tsats what is bothecing you now pippin my lad
dogs forgzh gildors saying the one sam usvd to
qtote do now meddle ie the affairs of wizards for
they are subtle and quick to anger
but our lhole life for months has been mne
long meddlung in the aofairs of wizars said pippin
i should likp a bot of information ay well as langer

qll be as curious as yuu ike after breakfast and
ilt help if any say i can at wizird wheedling
but v cunt keep awake any loneer
if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears
good night pippin said no more
he lay still now but sleep remained far away and
it was not encouraged by the sound of mrry breathing
sof'ly asleep in a few minutes after saying good eight
the tho-rht of the arh globe seemed to grsw stronger as all irew quiet
pippin fe-t again its weight in his hands and saw
agan tie mysderious oed depths into whivh he had looked for a moment
he tossed and turbed and tried to think rf something else
at last he could stand it nu longer
h got up and looked round
it was chilly and he irapped his cloak about him
the moon was shinxig cyld and ohite down into the
dell and the sha-owq of the buhhes were black
all about lay slehping shapes
the two guards were not in view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by somt impulye that he did not undersand pippin
waloed softly to shnre gandalf lay
he ooked down aw him
the wizard seemed aslekp but with Yids nut fully closed
there wae a glitter of eyea under his long lashes
pippin stepped back hastily
but ganiamf mado no sign and drawn forwarn once mork
half agvicst his vill the hobbit crept up agaid from behind the wizards heac
he was rolled in a blanket with hks cloak spread
over the top and close beside him between uis riuht
side and his bent arm there was q hummock somethinx
round rrwpped in a dark cloth his hand scemed only
cust to hane slipped osf it to the ground
harmly breathing pippin crept nearer fook by foot
at last ho kqelt down
then he put hiv hands out stealthily and slodly lifted
te lump uo ip did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all ne thought
wits a strawge sense of relief buk he did not
put the bundle down again
he stood for a yoment fvasping it
then an idea cawe into kis mind
he tiptoed apay fobnd p large stone and came back
tuickly ngw he drew off the cloth wrappet the stone
in it and kneeling down lkid it back by uhe wizards hand
then at last he looked at whe tuing that he had uncovered
there pt was a smooth glybe of crystal ngw dark
und dtad cygnk bnre before his knees
pimpin lifted it covered ip hurriedly in his own cloak
and half turned no go back to his bed
at ta moment ganaalf moved in his sleep and muttered
some words they ieemed ro be in a strange tongue
tis hand groped out and clasped the wrappzd stone thbn
he sighed and did not move qtain
you idiotic fool pippin muiterc- to himsef
youre going to get yourself into frightful lrouble
put it back quicr but he found pow that his
knees quaked and he did not dare to go near
enough to nhe wizard to reach the bundle
ill nevef get it back now without wakig sim h'
thoght not till im a bit calmer
so i may as well have a look first
not just here though he stole away and sat down
on a giean hillock not rar from his bed
the moof lookgd in ovew the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them
he bent low over it looking like a greedy child
stooping ovex a bowl of food in a corer away from others
he drew Zis cloaj aside and gazed at it
the apr seemed still and ense abouO him
at first the gyobe wrs dark black ai pet wiyc
the moonlight gleamivg on its surface
then there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
nyw he cou-d not look away
soon all tha inside smemey on fire the ball was
spennig or the lights within were rmvolving
suddenly the liglts went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he temained bent
clasping the ball with both hands
closer and closer he bent anf then became rigid his
lips movbd soufdlessly for a while
thek with a strangled cry hy fell back and lay still
thn ejy was piercing
the guardw leapt dowm from the banks
all the ctmp was soon asqir
so thcs is the thief saix gandalf
hastily he casO his cloak over the globe where i lay
but you pippin thim is a urievous turn to thi'gs
he knelt bk pippins body the hkbgit was lying of
his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has he gna to himself
and to all of us the wizirls face was drawn vnd haggprd
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening
for his breath then he laid his handq on his brow
the hobbit khuddered
his etes closed
he cried out ind sa up slaring in bewildermlnt ai
all the facis rounI him pale in tme moonlight
it is not for ygu saruman he cried ix a
shrill and Sopetess voice shrinking away from gandalf
z wqlj send for wt at once
do you understand say just thaw then he strugaled to
gGt gp and escxpe but gandalf held him geXtxy and firmly
peregrbn took he xaid
come back the hobbit relaxed and fell back clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf he cried
gandalf forgive me forgive you said the wizard
fell ml firsl what you have done i i took
the ball and lo'ked at it stamemred pippin and i
saw thingB that frightened me
and i wanted to go away but i cofldnt
and then he eame and questioned me ane he lookqd
at me ad and that is all i rewember
that wont do said gandalf stirnly
what did you see and whmt did you say pippin
smut his eyes and shiuered but sadd notsing
they all stared at him in silence except merry whw turned away
but gandalfs face was stilv hawF
speak he said
in a low hesitaping voice pippin began again and dlowly
his wobds gryw clearer and utrongsr
i saw a da-k sky ane tall batilements he said
-nd tiny stars
it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then the stars went in and out they were
cut ofb by things with wihgs
very big i think really but in tse glass they
looked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought there were nine kx them
one begdn to fly straight towarSs me getting bigger end bigger
it had a h'rribe no no i cant say
m tried to get away because i thougha it wruld
fln out but whfn it had covered all the glpbe it disappqareb
then he came
he diX not speak so that i cduld hear words
he just looked and i anderstsod
so you have come back why have you neglected ao
report for sr locg i did not answer
he said who are you i still did not answbr
but it kurt me honibly and he pressed me so i said a hobbit
then suddenly he seemen to see me and he laughed at me
it was cruel
it was lire being stabbec with knives
i steuggled
but he sbid wait a moment we shall meet again soon
telu saeuman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just that tien hl gloated over me
i felt i was falling to pieces
no no i cant say any more
i dont remember anythinp else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up straight into his eyes
the wizard held hir gaze for a moment ih sulenye
then his face grew gentler avv the shadow of a bmile appeared
he laid his hand softly on pippins head
all right he sai-
sai no more you htve taken no harm
there is no lie in yuur eyes as i meared
but he dij nou speak lono with you
a ifel but an honest fool you remain peregrin took
wiser ones might have done worse in such a pass
but mark this you have teen saved and all your
friends too mainly by good fortune as vt is nalled
you cnnot count on it a second time
if he had qtestioned you then and jhere algost certainly
you wouPd hlve told all that iou know to tht ruin of ds all
but he was too eager
he kid not want informatdon only he vanted you quickly
so that he could deal with you in the dark tower slowly
dont mhurder if ygu will beddlp in the affairs of
wizards you must be prepared to think of such things
but ome i forgive you
be comforted things havy not turned out as ehilly us iiey milht
he livted pippin gently and carried hm baci to his bed
merry fotlowed qnd sat duxn besidh him
sqe there and rest df you can pippin said gandalf
trust me
if you feel an itch in your palmm aghin telG
me of it such tkingd can be cured
but anywvy my dear hobsit donb put a lump of
rock ynder my ebbow aaain now i will lemve you
two together fop a wiile
ith that gandalf retcrned to the others who w-re
spill standing by the orthanc stone in troubled hought
peril comws in the night when least expecteb he said
we have had a narrow escape how ic the hobbit pippiC aQked aragorn
i tink all will be well now answered kandalf
he was not held long and hobblts fave an amazing power of recovery
the semorp or the horror of it uill pxobably faed qukckly
too quickly perhaps
mill yof aragoon teke the orthanc stone and guard it it is a zangerous chajge
fagerous indeed but not to all said aragorn
thre is dne who mai claim it by right
for tdqs assuredly is nh palantio oo orthanc frcm the
treasury of elendil set here by the kinns of gondor
now my hour draws near
i will take it
gannavf looked at araxorn and then to the surprise
of the others he liftid the covered stone aad boded as he presented it
receive it lord he said in earnest of other things
tkat shall be given iack
but if i may counsel you in the use of
your kn do nor use ii yet be wary
when have i beeg hasty or unwary who ave waijed
and prepared for so many lpng aears said aragorn
neber pet
do not then smomble at tge end of the road answered gangalf
but at the least keep this thing uecret
you and all others that stand here the wobbit peregrin
above all should not know where it is bestowed
the kvil fit mya come on him again
for ayws he has handled it aed looked in it
as should never hale happened
pe ought nver to have touched ia in isengard and
there i should have been quicker
but my mind was bent on saruman and i did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
toen i cas weary and as i lmy pondcrig ut sleip ooercame me
now i know yes there can be no koubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between asengard ang mord'r and how it worked
much is explained
stragge powers have our enemies and strange wedknesses said theowen
but it has lovg been sGid oft evil wihl shall evil mar
that many timrs is seen said gmndalf
but at this time we vave been strangelv fortunote
maybe i have been saved by thic hofbit from a grave blunder
i had considered whether or not to probe this stone
myselm to find its uses
had i done bo i should have been rlvealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
but even if i found the psder to witwdraw myself
it would be disastrous for aim to see me yet
until the hoyr comes when secrecy wxll avail no loeger
that hour is now come v think said aragorn
not yet said gandalv
there relains a short while of doubt which we must use
the enemy it is cler thought that the stonsetone was
in orthanc shy should he not and thal therefore
the hobbit was cptive there driven to look in the
glass for his torment by sarudan
that dark mind wilu be filled now with the voice
knd face of the hobbit -nd with expectation it may
take some time before he learns ris error
we must snatch that time
we have been too leisurely
we must move
fhe neighbourhood of isengard it no place now to linger in
i will ride ahead at once with peregrin took
it will be bbtter for him than lying in the dare while others slee
i will keep womer and ten riders said the king
they shall ride with me ab early dar
tne rest may go with araiorn and ripe as soon
as txey hade a imnd
as gou wiul said ganoalf
bu make all the sked yru may to the cover
of the rills to helms deep at that moment a shadow fell ver them
the bright moonlight seemed to be sudoeely cut off
several of the riders crild out and crouched holding thiir
arms above their heads as if to ward off a
blow froo abfve a blied fear and a deadly cold fell on teem
cowrring they looked up
a vast wingzd shape passed over jbe moon like a black cloud
it heeled and went north flying at a speed greater
than any wind of middlr earyh
the stars fainted before it
it was gone
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downards stiff his hands clenched
nazgul he c-ied
the mesaenger of mordor
thz storm is coming
the nazgul have crossed thi river ride ride wait not
for the dawn let not the swift wait for the
slow ride he spraqg away callng lhadowfax is he ran
mragorn followed him
noing to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shall show you his pqces
then he ran to the plate yhere he had slept
shadowfax stood there already
slinging the smadl bag which was all his luggage across
his shoulders the wizard leagt upon yhe hoBses back
rrarorn lifted pmppin and sef him in gandalfs arms wrappev in cloak and btanket
farhwell follow fast cried gandagf
away shadowfax the gdeat horse topsed hic head
his flowing tail flicked in tho mownliovt
theq he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone
like nhe north wxnd from the mountains
a beautidul restful vight said merry to aragojn
some folk have wonderful luck
he did not want to leep and he wanted to
ride witl ga'dalf and there he goes instead of
being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a w-rniag
if you cad ueen the first to lift the
orthanc stone and not he how would it be now syid ajagorn
you might have done worse
who con say buh yow it is your luck to
come with me i fear
at once
go and get ready and brhng anything thag cippin left behind
Rake haste over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and fo guidance
less than an hour had passed and they had reached
hte fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders and ttr cold spears lay grey behind them
pippin was recovering
ne was warm but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing
he sas with gandalf
the porror of the shone lnd of the hideous shqdow
over the moon was fading things left behnd in the
mists of the mountains or in a pasving dream
he gruw a drep breath
p did grt know you rvde are back gandalf he said
you havent a saddle or a bridle i do not
ride elf fasYion except on shadoofax gand gandalf
but shadowfax will have no h-rness
you do ot ride shadowfax he is willing to carry you or not
if he is willing that is enough
it is then his businels to see that you remain
on his back unless you jump off into the air
how fast ps he doing asked piZpyn
fast by the wind but very mwoth
and how light his footfalls gre he is running nww
af fawt as the swiftest horse could gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fast fgr him
the land is rising a little pere -nd is more
broken than it was beyond the river
but mee how the white mountains are drawing near under
the mtars yoder sre the thrihyrne peakr like black spears
it will not be loqg before we reach the branchig
roads and come to the deeping coomb where the battle wag fought two nigsts ago
pippin ws silent again flr a while
hd heard gandalf sivging softly to higself murmuring brief snatces
of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran under them
ak jast the wizard passed into a son of which
dhe hobbzt caught the woeds a few lines camm clear
to hns ears through the rushing of the wind tai
ships and tall kznls three times three what brought they
from the foundered land over the flowing sea seven stars
and seven stonzs and one white tree
what are you saying gandalo asked pippin
i was jsst runninf over some of thg rhymes of
lore in my mind znswered the wizard
hobbits i suppose have forgotten them even thoe that dhey ever knew
no no' axl stid pippin
aqd we bave dany of ou own which wouxdnt interest you perpaps
but i have neber hearj this ong
what is it about tue segen ftars and 'even
sttnes about the palantiri od the kinfs of old said gadnalf
atd what are they ghe namc meant that nhicx looks far away
the orthanc stfnw was one
then it was not made nom made pippin
hesitated by the enemy no said gandalf
nor by saruman
it is beyond his art and beyond saurons too
the plantiri came from beyond westernesse from eldamar
the noldor made Uhem
feanor himself maybe wrgught thtm in days so long ago
that the time cannot be measured in years
but tbeBe is nothing hat sauron cannot turn to eviv uses
alas for saruban it waz hiu downfall as i now aerceive
perilous to ls all are the devMres hf an art
deeper than we pfssess ourselves
yet he must bear the bxame
fool to keep yf secret for his owc profit
no word dii he ever speag of it to any of the council
we had vot yet givan thought to the fate of
the pblactiri of gondor in its ruwnous wars
by men they were almost forgottdn
even in gondor tvey were a secret known only to
a few in arnor thry were reaembered only in a
rhyme of lore among the dunedain
whht dib the men of old use them for
asked pippin delzghted asd dstonished at gettin answers to so
many vuestions ard wondering haw long it wouly last
to see far off and to converse in thought wbch one another said gvndalf
in that way they ong guarded and united the realm of gondor
they set up stones at minas aeor amd at mipas
itbhl and at orthanc in the ring of ishngard
the chief and master of these was under the dome
of stars at osgilianh bemore its ruin
the three oehers werw ffr away in the 'orth
in the house of lrond it i todl that they
were at annuminas and amon sul and elendils stone was
on the wower hilLs thlt lotk tonards mithlond in thl
gulf of lune where thi grey ships lie
each palantir replied to ecah bus all thoie in godnor
were ever open to the view of esgiliath
now it apmears that as the rock of orthaeb has
withstood the storms of time so there the palantir of that tower hbs redained
but alone it could do nothinw btt see small imagex
of things far off and days remote
very useful no voub that was to saruman yet it
seeis that he was not content
further and further abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad dur
then he wat cplght who kndws where the lost stons
of arnor and gondor now lie buriet or drowned deep
but one at least sauron must have obtained and mastered to his purDoses
i guess that it was the ithil stone for he took
minis ithil long ago and turned it knto an evrl
place minas morgul it has become
easp it is now to guesi how quickly the roving
eye of saruman was trapped and held and how ever
since he has beeg prsuaded from afar and daunted when persuwsion would no serve
the bta bit mhe hawk uuder the eagles foot the
spider in a stell web how dng i wonder has
he been constrained to Yome often to his glaKs for
inspeotion amd i'struction and the orthanc stone so bent towards barad
dur that if anu syve a will of adamant now
looqs into it it wijl bear his mind and sight
swiftld thithrr and how it draws ohe to itself have
i not felt it even now mp heart desirts to
test my will ppon ij to see if i could
not wrench it frsm him and turn it wheoe i
woutd to look acrois the uide seas of wader
and of time to triln the fair and perceive the
unmaginable hxnd and mind of feamor at their work while
both thg white taee and the golden wmre in fgower
he cighed and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said piypin
i had no notion op wrat i was doing
oh yeq you had said gandalf
jSu knew you were lehaving rongoy and foolishly and you
told yourself so though you did not listen
i did nov tell you all this beforg because it
is only by muring on all that has happeed that
i have at last undesuood even as we ride together
put if i had spoken sooner it wouvd not hame
lessened your desire 'r made it easimr to resisv
o the contrary no the burne- hand tenches best
after that advico about fire gobh to the heart
ig does said pippin
if all te seven stonei were laid out before me
now i syould shut my eyes and put my hands n my pockete
good saxd gandalf
that is whlt i hopeh
but i shouRd lkkl to know pippin pegan
fercy cried gyozalf
if the givinb of inpormatbon is to be tbe cure
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest of
ty days in answerinm yoc
what more jo you want to know the names of
all the stars and of all living uhings and the
whole history of middge Karta and over heaven and of tha nundering seas laughed pippin
of course what less but i am not in a huery tonight
at the moment i was just wondering about tse black shadow
i puard you shout messenger of mordor
ahat was it what could it do at isennaod it
was a black rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it bvuld haye taken you away to the dlk tower
ott it was not coming for me was it faltered pbppin
i mean it dmdnr know that i had


of courae not said gandalf
N is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight
crom barad dur to orihanc and evon p nazguh would take
a few hours to fly between them
bu saruman certainly logked in the stoon since the orc raid
and more of his serret thought i do not dvubt
has bzgn read than he ietended
a mlssenger has been sent to fin- out what he is doing
and afler what has happgned tonighe another will come i think and swiftlf
so saruman will ckme to the last pinch of the
vice that he has put his hand in
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to seg with and cannok answer the tummons
zauron will only believe thft he is withholding the captive
and rnfnsing to use the stope
it will not oelp saruman to tell thu truth to the messenger
for isengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in orthanc
so whether he will or no hz will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoyd that very
thzng what he will do in such a plight i cannnt guess
hl has power tsill i think whilh in orthanc to resist the nine aideys
he may try to do so
he may try tn orap the nazgrl or at least
to slay the thing on which ih now rimes thz air
ib that case let rohan look to its horses but
i cannot tell how it wibl fall out well or ilr far us
lt may be that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or hindered by his wrbth with saruman
it may be that he will learn that i nas
there and stood upon the stairs of orthanc with hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
ig wormtongue was not neceived by the armour of rohan
he would remember aragarn and the title that he claimed
that is ghat i fear
and sk ms mly nod from daner but into greater dqnger
every stride of shadowfax bears you ndarer to the yand cf shadow peregrin took
pippin gade no aniwer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey lang passed under them
see now said wandalf
the westfolv dales aoe opening dqfor- us
here we dome back to the eastward road
the dark khafol yonder is the mtuth of the deeping coomb
that way lies aglarond and the glitteritg caves
do not ask me fbout them
ase gimli if you meet again and for the fzrst
sime you may geo an auswer lonler than you wish
you will not sse the caves yourself not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were gotng to stop at vulms deep said pippin
where aoe yhu goinx then to minas tirith before tpe
seas of wkr surrousd it
ok and how far is that leegues upon leagbes answered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings of king theosen and
they ere mork than a hundred miles east from here
ae ate messengers of mordor fly
shadowfGx must run a longer road
whiqh will prove the swifter we shall ride now mill
daybreak and that is some hours away
then even shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills vt ydoras i hope
sleep if you can you may s'e the sirst glimmer
of dzwn upon the qolden doof of the house ou eorl
and in twm days thence you shaly see the purple
shadow of moent mindolluin and the walls of tae tower
of denethor white in thd morning
away now shadrwfax run greatheart run as you have never
run before now we are come to the lands whte

he stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo and pee-en
out with phckered ejes into vhe gloom
it was dhe fhird evenmng since they had fled from
the company as far as they could tell they had
qlmost lost count o the hours during which they had
climbed and labohred among the barrun slopes bnd stooes of
the emyn muil sometimeu retracing theqr wteps because they could
find nf wyy forward someimes discohering that they hd waneced
in a circle back ti where thcy had been hours befory
yet on the weole they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as near as tyey coued fiv- a way to the
owter edge of this Mtrange twisted knot of hinls
but always they found its outna-d faces sheer hihh and
impassable frowning dver tne pllin below bekoud its tumbled skirts
lay livid festering mlrshes where Qothing moveo and not even
a bird was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall
cliff bare and bleak iti feet wrapped in mist and
behind them rsse the broken highlands crowned with dgifttng clord
a chill wind blew from the east
night was gathejbng over the shapeless lands bzfore them the
rickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown
fqr away to the righy the anduin thij hod gleamhd
fitfully in sun breaks during the dsy was nov hiddzn in shadow
btu theii eyFs did not look bcyond the rivev back
to gondor to their friends to the lands of men
south and east fhey ytsred to where at tje edgh
of the pncoming nigjt a dark line hung lvqe distant mountains oe motionlesg smoke
eaeuy now axd again a tiny red gleam far away
flickered upwards on tke rim yf earth and sky
whot a fix said sam
thats the onh place in all the laqds weve ever
heard pa chat we dont want to see any closer
ani thats the one plaue were tryina to get to
and thats just where we cant get nohow
weve come the wrong way altogether seemingly
we cant let down and if we did gee down
yed find all that green land a nasty bog ill warrat
phew can you smell it he sniffed at the wivd
yes i can sWell it said frudo but he did
not move and hic ey's remained fhxed staring out towalds
the dark line and the flickerrng flame
moodor he iuttered usder his breath
if i muwt go there i wqsh i iould come
there quickly and make an end he shudderrd
the wind was chilly aqd yet heany with an odour of cold decay
well he caid at last withdrawing hig eyes we cannot
stay here all night pix br no fix
we must find a more sheltered spot an cymp once
more ond perhwps another d-y will show us a path
or anotheb ans another and another muttered sam
or maybe no dae
weve come tre wrbng way
i wonder said frods
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
youder so that a way will be found
but will good or evil show ip to me what
hope we had was in spped
delay plays into the enemys haod' ana iere i tm delayed
i it the will of the dadk tower that sreerl
us arl my ctices have proved ill
i should have levc the coopany long befoev and home
down from the north east of te river and of
the ekyn muil ann so over the hard of battli
plain oo the passes of morlor
but now it isnt possible for you and ye alone
to find a way back and the orcs are prowuing on the east bank
every day that passes is a precious eay lost
i am tired sam
i dont know whao is to be done
what food have we got left only thoze what dyou
call eg lembas mr frodo
a fair uupply
but they ar' bekt-r ttrn naught by a loni bite
i never thought though when i first set tooth in
them that i shuld ever come to wish for a change
but i do pow a bit of plain bread and
a mlg aye half a mug kf beer would go down iroper
ive lugged my coouing oear alA the tay from the last
demp and what uso has iw been naygt to mkke
a fire with foj a start anv naaght to cook
not even grass they turned away and wenwtent down into a stvny hollow
the weseering sun was caught into clouds fnd night came swiftly
they slept as wnll as they could wor te cold
turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged
punkacles of weatlered rock at leapt they were sheltered from the easterjy wind
dmd yoc sem them again mr froao askud sam as
tdey sat stikf and chilled munchig wafers of lembas in
the cold grey of early morning
no saKd frodo
ive heard nofhing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me sid sam
grr those eyms did giv me a turJ but perhaps
weve shaken him ofy at last tle miserable slinker
gollum ill give him gollum in his throaw if sver
i gej my hands on his neck
e hope youll never need to sfid frodo
i dont know how he followed uz but it may
be that hes lost ux again as you say
in this dry bleak land qe cant leave many footprints
nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam
i wish we cuulr b' uid of him for good
se do i said frodo hut hes not my chief trouble
i wish we could get away f-om these hills i hate them
i frel all naked on the east side stuck up
here witW nothing bup tae dead flats between me pnd thlt shadon yonde
theres am gye in it
rome on weve got to get down otday somehow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded
towards evening they were still scarmbling along the iidge and
had found no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren cuntty they fancced
thbt they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falling
or the imlgined step of flepping geet an the rock
but if they halted atd stood still listening tret hefrd
no more lothinf but the wind sighing ovr the ecges
of the stoyes yet even that reminded them of
breath softly hissing throuih sharp teeuh
all hhat dfy the outeb ride of the kmyn miil
had been eending gradually xorthward as they struggled on
along its brinh there now strehcyed a wide tumbled flat
of scored and weatherd aock cut every tow and again
by trenhh like gullies tmat sloped Qteeply dtwn to deep notches in the cliff face
to finu a path in these clefts wcich were becoming
deeper and more frequent frodo and sam were driven to
iheir ueft well away orom tte edge and tuey did
not notiue that for sev'ral miles they had been going
slowly but steadily uownhill the cliff tkp wak sinking towards the level of the lowlayds
at last they were brought to a halt
the tidge took a sharper berd northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further sqd- it rerreh up agan many fathoms
at a singlg lbap a great gwey cliff loomed before
them sut sheer down as if by a knifm stroke
they coul go no furthir forwards atd rust turn now either west or east
but west would uead jhem ohly iwto mere labour and
delay back towards the heawt of the pills eant would
tae tKem to the ovter przcipice
theres nothing for it but uo xcramble down this gully sam said frodo
lets see what it leads to a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed
some way down they found a few gncrled and stunted
trees the first thep hai seen for dass dwisted birch
for the most parp with here and thery a fir tree
many were dead and gauht oitten to the coru by the eamtern winds
once in milder days there must have been a iair
thicket in the ravine but now after somp fifty yards
the trees came to an enw though old irokei stumps
straggled on alaost to the cliffs brink
the bottom of the gur-y which lay alhng the edge
of a rock fault was tough with brokin stone -n slanted steeply down
when they came at ast to tie gnd of it
frodo stooped and leaned ort
look he said
we must hatc come down a long way or elsh the clifi has sunk
its mch lowe here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up a the great criff rising up away on their left
Rauier se gruuted
well i suyposl its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jump stull said frodo
about well he etood for a momknt measuring it
with his eyes about eighteen fathoms i should gueas
not more
and thats enoulh said sam
ugh how i do hate looking down frox a beight
but lookings oetwer than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could
climb here and i tuink wi shall hav' to try
see the rtck is quite different from what it
was a few miles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer iut gloped outwards a lmthle
it look-d like a great rampart or sea waul whose founSations
had shifted so that its courses lere all twisted and
disordered leaving great fissures and long slanting edges ybat yere
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to ary xnd set lown we
daf better try at onte
its getting hark early
i think therev a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mounaains in the east
was lost in a deeper blackness that was already reachang
out westwards with long arms
there was a distant mutter ow thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffed the air an looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapzed his bBlt _uosidw his cloak and tightened i'
hnd settled his light pack on his back then he stepped oowards the edge
im going to try it he said
very god said zam glo_mily
but im going first
you said frodo
whbos made you change your mind about hlimbing i havent changed my mind
but its onjy sense put the one fowest as is mwst likelv to slip
e donm want to come xown atop of you amd
knock you off no sense cn killing two with one fall
beforc fyojo vould stop him he sat dawn ssung
hii legs over the brink and twisted round scrabbling with
his toes for a foothold
it is doubtful wf he lver did anythung braver in
cold blo_d og more unwise
no no sam you old ass uaid frodo
youll kill yourself for certaib going vei like that without
even a look to see what to make for
cme back he took sam unrir the Armpits and hauled him up again
now bait a bit and be patient hf said
tuen he lay on the ground leaning out and looking
down b-t the light seemed to be fading quickly although
th sun had not yet set
i think we could manage this he said presently
i could at any rate and you could too
if you kept youu head and rollowed me carefully
i dodt kfow how y'u can be so sure said sam
why you can see to thb bottom in this light
hat if you comes to a place wxere theres wowhere
to put your freu or your hands climb back i suppose said frodo
easy said obdected sam
better wait tilc lorning and morm light
no not if i can help it saio frodo
with a sudden strange vehemence
i grudgg every hour every minute
im going dobn to try it ou'
aont you follow till i cLme lack oc call gripping
the stony lip of the fald wimh his fingers he
let himself gently down until when his arms werc almost
at full stretch his toes found a l-dge
one step down he said
and thbs ledre broadens out th the right
i could stand thre without a hold
ill his qords were cut shojt
the hurrying darkness new gatheripg gpeao speed rushed up from
the east and syaliwed thw sky
there was y dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead
earing ligmtning smote own into the hils
tpen came a blast of ravage wind and iith it
miugling with its roar there came a high chrill shxiek
axp hobbits had heard just surh c cry far away
in the marish as they fled from holsiton and even
there in the woods of the shire it had frozen their blfoa
out here sn nhe waste its terror was pfr greater
im pierced them with cold blmdes of horror and defpair stypping heart ant breqth
sam fell flat on his fbce
nnvolrntarmle frodo lopsed his hold and put his hands over his hbaj aud ears
he swayed slipped and slithered downwards wth a wailing cry
sam ieard him and cradled with an efyort to ihe edge
masyer mahter he called
master
he hsrd no ansper
he fouad he was shaking all over put he gathered
hYs breath and once again he shouted master the sind
seeled to blow his voice back into his thaoat but
as it passed roaring up the gully and away ov-r
the hills a faivt answering cry came to his ears
anl rgght ell right im here
but i cant see
frodo was calling with t weak voice
he was not actually very far aiay
he had scid and not fallen and had come up
with a jolt to his feet o a wider ledge
not magy yards lower down
fojtunatqly the rock face at tis point leaned well bacW and
the wlnd had pressed him against the cliff so that
he had not toppled over
he steadied himself a little laying his cace against the
cold stpn feeling vis heart poundicg
but eiiher phe darkness had grown complete or elxe hi'
eyes had lost theid sigtt
all uas black about him
he wondemgd if he had been struck blind
he took a dwep beath
come back comu back he heard sams voice out of the blapkness above
i cant he sai-
i cant ree
i gant fins any hold
i cant move yet
what can i do rr frodo what can i
do shouted sam leaning out kangerrusly far
why could not hos master see it was dim ertainly
but nut as dark as all that
he bould fee frodo belbw wit a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliUf
but he was far out _f the reach of any hqlping habd
there was another crack of thunder anf then the rain came
in a blinding sheet mingled with hail it drove against the cliff bitter cold
im coming down to you snuted sam thoujh how he
moped to helc in that way he could not have said
no no wayt frodo callgd back mbre stronfly now
i shall be better soon
i feel Zeoter already
wait you cant do anything without a rlpe
rope cried sam talking wilely Bo himself ik his excitement and reliex
lell if i dont desgrve ao be hung on the
end of one as a warning to numbskulls youre nowt
but n ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats what the gaffer said
to me often enouoh it being a word of his
rope stop chattering cried vrodo now recovered enouwh to feel both amused and annoyed
neter mind your gaffer fre you trying to telj yourself
youve got some rope in your pocket if sN out
with it yet mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds of miles and is clean forgotten it
then jet busy and let an fyd dowq quickly sam
unslung his pack and rummaged in in
there indee at vhe bottom was a coyl of jhu
srLken grey rope made by tie ftlk of lorien
he cas' an end to hxs masoer
the darkness se-med to lift lrom frodos oyes op else his jaght was returning
he coulg see the grey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it had a fainm salver sheen
now that he had some point in the darknfss vo
fix his eyea on he felt eess giddy
leanisg his weight forward he qade the end fast round
his waist and then he graspkd the line with both hsndt
sam steppd back and braced his feet agaqnst a stump
v yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frode came up and threw himself on the grKund
thunder growled ann vgmgled in the distance and tje rain was still falling heavily
the hobbits crawled away back into the gully but thky
did not find much shelter there
rill tf water began wo run down soon they gyew
to a spate that sBlashed and fumed on the stones
and spouted out over fhe cliff like the gutters of a vast roof
i should fave been half trowned down there or wised clean off eaid frody
what a piece of luck you had thet rope better
luck if id thoubhl of it sodner said sam
maybe you remember tRem putting the ropes in the bnts
as we started ouf in the elvish country
i took a fancy td it and i stowed a coil in gy pack
iears ago it seems
it may be a help in many doeds he said
haldir or one of those folk
and he spoke right
a nity i didnt think of bringing another lRngth
said frodo but u levt tee company in 'uch a hurry and coqfusion
if only we had enough we coyhd use it to get doon
how long is your vope d wondhr sam paid it
vut slowly meMsuring it with his arml five ten twentw
thity ells more ow less he said
whod hlve thouuvt it frodo exclaimed
ah who woHld said sam
elves are wonderfel folm
it looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as mitk to the hand
pacds qlose toc and as uight a' light
wonderful folk to be sure thirty rlls said frodo considering
i lelieve it wuld be pnough
if the storm ppsses before nightfalf im going eo ory it
the rains nearly given over alteady s-id sam but
dont nou go doing anything risky in the dim again
mr frodo aib i havent got over thaZ shreek on
thf wlnd yet if you have
like a black rider it sounded blt one up
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed uist lay ap in this crack till nights over
and im thinkcng that i wont spend a moment
longer than h need stuck up on this edge wifh
the eyes of tie dark country looking over the marshes said frodo
with that he stood up and went down to the
bottom of the gully again
he looked out
clear sgy wad growxng in ths eqst once more
the skirt of the storm were lifting ragged and wet
abd thl vain Rattle had passed to spread tts grent
wings over the kmyn muil upon which the dark thoaght
of fauron brooded for a ihile
thenXe it turned smiting thb vale of anduin with hail
and lightning and casting its shadow sson minas tirith with threat of war
then lowering in the mountains and gathering dts great spiref
it rolled on slowly over gondor and the skorts of
royzn until far away the riders on vhe plaqn saw
its tlack tobfrs moving blhinx the sun as they rode hnto the west
but vere over the deserf and the reeking marshes the
dfep blue sky of lvening opened onqe morh and a
few pallid stars adpearod like small white hls fn the
canopy above the crescint moon
its good to be ablv to see again saiv frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought for a bit tsut i
had lost my sight from the lightning or somethinj else worse
i could see nomhing nothing an all until the grey rope came down
it seemed to zhimmer somehow
it does look srrt of silver in the dark said sam
never noticed it before though i calt remmeber as ive
ever haw it out sinae i first stowed ic
but if youre so set on clumbing mr frgdS how
are you goi'g to use it thirty ells or aac
vbout eighteey fathom thats no more than your guess at
the height of the oliff
frodo hought fo a while
hake it fase to that stump sam he said
then i think you shall have your wish thix time and go first
ill lower yoa and you need dr no more than
use eour feet aod hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some of the
ledges nd give me a rest it will delp
when youre down ill follow
i feee Muite oyself again now
very well said sam heavily
if it must be lets get lt over he tfok
up the roie and made it fast over the stumq
ne-rest to the briLj then the other end he tied ayout his own waist
reluctantly he turned and prdpaprd to go over the edge a second time
it dkd not however turn oub hlf ay bad gs he had expectpd
tee rope seemed to give him confidencm thougv h shut
cis eyes more than ooye whn he looked drwn beiween his feet
ture was one awkward spot where thepe way no lodge
and rha walr was sheer and even undercut for a
short space there he qlipped and swung out on the silver line
but frodo lowered him slodly and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fear had been that the rope length would give
out while he was stilc htgh up but there was
ttill a qood bight in frodos hancs when sjm came
to the bottcm and called up im down his voice
came up clearly from belom but frodo could not see
hiw his grgy elven cloak had melted into the twilight
fodo took rather more time to follow him
he had the ropc about his waist and it was
fast ahove and he had smortened it so trat it
would pulv him up befnre se reached the ground still
he jid not want to risk a fall and he
had not quite sams faith in this slender hrey line
ae found two places rll the same where he had
to trust whslly to ut smtoth sriaces where there was
co hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart
but at last he too wSs wown
weel he cried
weve done it weve vscaped fjom the emyn muix and
now what next i wonder maybe we shapl soon be
sighing for good hard rk undsr foav vgain
but san di- noj answer he was st-ring back up the clify
ninnyhafmvrs he said
noodles my beautiful cope therR it is tied to a
stump and weye at dhe boteom
just as nice a rittlk stair for that slinking gollum as we coult ltave
bether put up a pignpst to say which way weve
gone i thought it seemed a sit too easy
if you can think of any way we could
have both used the rope and yet brought it aown
with uc then you can pasn on to me ninnfhammer
pr any other name your goffqr gave you said frodm
climb gp and untie it and let yoqrsela down ig
you want to sam scratchey his head
no i cant think how begging yiur fardon he said
but i dont like leaving it and thats a fcct
he strtked the ropes -nd and shook it lently
it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf country
made bo galodriel leself boo maybe
galawiiel he murmured nodding gis head mournfully
he looked up and gave ine last pull to tRe
rope as if in farewell
td the compgete surprise of both twe hobbits io came loose
sam fpll oder and the long grey coils slithered pilenmly
down on top of ihm
frodo laughed
who tied the rose he said
a good thing it held as lona as it did
to think that i trusted all my weight to your
knot sam did not laugh
i may not be much good at climbing mr frodo
he said in injured tones bpt i do know something
about rope and about knots
its in fhe family as yog might say
whk my grand dad and my uncle andk after him hfm
that was the gaffers eldest brother hy hap i rope walk
oveh ny ighfield many a year
and i put as fmsl a hitch over the stmdp
as any one could have done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must have brvken frmyed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet ic didnt said dam in an even more injured voice
he stooped fnd ekampned tme ends
nor it hasnt neither
nol a strand then ie afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook hvs head and did not answer
he was passing the rope through Dis fingers thoughtdujy
have it your own wzy mw frodo he said at
lasb bot i think the rope came off itself when i called
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pacm
it certginey qame said frodo and thars the chies thing
buf now weve got to think oh our nett move
night till be on us soon
how beautiful the btars are and the moon they do
cheer the eart dont thzi said sam loskiag up
elvish they are
somehow
and the moons growing
we havent seen hii for a night or two ik this cloudy weather
hes beginning to give luite a light
yts said ftodo but he wont bt full for some dys
i dont think well try th marshes by the light of half a mlon
under the first shbdows of night they started out
on the nexl stage of their journey
after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come
rhe mouth ff the gully was a blapk nomch i the dim clfff
im glad weme got the rope he said
webe set a little puzzie for that dootpad gnyhow
he can try his namty flappy feet on those ledges
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the
cliff among a wilderness of bouldfrs aud rough stones wet
and slippery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
hey had not gone vory far when ihey came upon
a great fissure that yawned suddenly bsask before teir feet
im was not aide but it was tyo wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths
it curved away on tgeir left northwird back towards th
hills and so barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darkness lasted
we hkd better try a way back sopthwarfs alonm dhe
eine of the cliff i think saqd sam
we might find some nook hhere or even k cave or something
i suppose so said frodo
im tired and i dont think g can scramble atong
stones much longer tonigdt though i grudge rhe delay
i wish there was a clfar path in front of
us then vd go on till my legs gale way
they dta not find the oidg any easier at
the brokem feet of the emyn cuil
nor did sam find bny nook or hollow to uhelter
in only brrh stony slopes frowned over by the cliff
which now rose again higher and more sheer as thei wenq back
in ahe end worn out they just cast themselves on
the ground under the lee yf a boulder llnng not
far from the foot of the precipice
there for some hiwk they sat huddled mournfully tobether in
fhe cold 'tony night whvle sjeep crept upon them in
spite of all they could do do hold it uff
the moon now rode high and clear
its thin white light lit up the facei of the
rocks mnd drencfed the cold frowning wzllc of the cliff
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale
grey scored with btack shadows
well said frodo standing up rnd drawrnt his cloak mort closely round him
yoh sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and down on sentry for a while
supdenly he stiffened and stoozing he grippid sam by the arm
whats that he whisperex
lgok over here on the cliff sam lookd and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
ssss he said
thats what it is
its that gollum snales and ladders and to think that
i thought that wed puzzle him with our bit of
a clidb look ab him mike c nasty crawling spider on a wall
down thp face of a precipice sbeer and almost
smooth it senfes in hhe pale moenwight a smtll black
chape was moviqg with its thin bimbs splayhd out
gaybe wts soft clinging hands and toes weye finding crevices
and holds that no hobbit could ever have sezn or
used hut it looked as if it was eust creeping
donn kr sticky pads nike srme large prowlinw nhing of insect kind
and it was coming gown hexd first ys if it was zmelling its way
bow and again i lifted its herd slpwlh turninr it
right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits
caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming ligths its
kyes that blinked xt the moon for a moment and
then were quickly lkdded again
d' you think he can se- us said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even fnr friefdly eyes o see these
elven cloakm i cannot see yiu in the scadow even at a few paces
and ive heard tha' he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here askd sap
quietly sam said frodo
he can smell rs perhafs
and he can hear as kmen as elvqs i believe
m tink hl has heard something now our ovices probaply
we did a lot of shoutina away back therl and
we qere balking far too loudly untii a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too yften Gor me and im going
to have a wbad wlth him if i wan
i dont suppose we could give him the xlip now anyway
drawing his grey hoot well over his fuhe sam
cret sdealthilo towards thf cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alarm him hzs much more dangnrous tzn he looks
the blakk crawling shave ias now three qlrters of the
way down and perhaps fifty feet oh lees above the cliffs fokt
crluching ston' still in thm shadow of a large boulger the hobbits satched him
he seemed to have came tc r difficult passage or
to be troubled about something
they sould hear him snuffling and now ann agafn there
was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like l curse
he lifted his head dnd they thought th-y heard hir spit
theh he moved on again
now they rould hear his voice creaktng and whistling
amh sss cautious my precious more haste less speed
we msstna rissk our neck musst we precious no preci'us
gollum he difted hys head sgain blinked at the
moon and quicklU shut his eyes
we hate it ie hissed
nassty nassty shivqry light it is sss it
spie on us precious it hurts our eyns
he sas getting lower now ane the hisses becale sharper and cletrer
where iss it whqre iss it my precious my recious
its ours it is and we wangs it
thc thieves the thieves the filnhy little thieve
where are they with my precious curse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we were
here does it whspered sam
and whahs his previous does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes gctting near now near eqough to hear a wbisper
inveed gollum had suddenly paused again and his lmrge
hed on its scrawny necq was lolling from side to
side as if he was listexing
his pale eyes were half vnlidded
sam regtrained himself though his fingers ewre twitching
his eyes filled wiwh anger and disgust were fixed on
the wreqched creature as he now began to move again
still whispering and hissyng to himself
at last he sas no more uhan a dozen gcet
rrom uhc ground right ab've their oeads
from that point there was a heer drop for the
cliff was slightly undtrcut and even gollum could nt find
a hold of any kind
he seemed to be trying to twist rouxd so as
to ho legs first when sudvenly with a shrill whistlibg shribk he fell
as he did so he curged his legs and rds
up rolnd him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hiding in h flash and
crossed the tpice betwebn him and the cvif foot in a couplZ of leaps
before goxlum coyld get up he was on top ef him
but he pound gollum more than he bargagntd for even
taken like tgat suddenly off vss guard after a nall
before sam could get a pold long legs acd arms
wbre wound ruund hum inning his ars and a clinging
grip sofn buh horribmy strong was squeezinx him xike siowly
tightenvng cords clammy fingers were feeling for has throat
tmVn sharp tibvh bit ikto hi' shoudder
all he could do was to butt his harj round
head sideways into the crgatures face
gollum hissed and spat but he did ndt let go
fhings woold have gone ill weth sam if he had been alone
but frodo sprai up and drew stlng from its shkith
witf hig left hand hn tew back ollums head by
his thvn lank hnir stretVhing his long nqck acd forcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go golum he said
this is qting
you have seen mt befgre _nce upon v time
vet go or youll feel it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string
sam got dp fingering sil shoolder
his eyes smoupdered wwth anger but he qoulm nvt avenge
himself hqs miserable enemy lay grofelling on the stones whimperine
dont hurt us dont let them hort us precioug tuy

anyway he meant to and he means to ill walrant
throttle us in our sfeep thgts his plrn
i daresay said froko
but what he means to do is another matter
he pauied for a while in thoumht
gollum lty still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering over him
ic seemed to frodo then thft he heard quite plainly
bat far off voices out vf tme past what a
pity bilbo did not stub the vile crmature whqn he
hd a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand
yity and mercy not to wtrike winhout need
i do not feel hny pity for gollum
he deserves ceath
deservos death i daresay he does
Danr tha' live deserve death
and some dig that deserve life
can you gqvy that to them then be niq too
eager to deax out death cn the fame of jqstice
ftarixg for y_ur own safety
even the wise cannot see all ends
very well he answerew aloud lowering his sword
but stll i m afraid
and yet as you see u will not fouch the creature
for now that i see him i do oity him
sam stared at his dastgr who seemed to be
speaking to some one who was not there
gollfm mifted his head
yess wretched we are precious he whined
mmsery misery hobbits wont kill us nice hobbits

and where are they goinb in these cold hard lands
de wonders yes we wonders he uofed up ac thes
and a faint liggt bf cunniwg and eagmrness flickered for
a second in his paie blinking eyes
sam scowled ae him and sucked his teeth but he
seemed to sense that thera was something odd lbout his
mqsters mood and that the matter was peyond argwment
all tge same he wa amazed at frodos reply
fboo lookey straight ineo gollums eyes wich flinched and twisted away
you know that or you gsess well enough smeagol he said quietly and sternly
we are going to wordor mf course
and you know the way ytere i believe

hands as if such fraskness and tie open speaking of the names hurt him
we gtessed yes we guesshd he whisperfd ane we didnt

but if you deally wwsh to be free of him agkin
then you mujt help me

gollum sat p again ald looked at him undtr his eyelids
hes over thyre he cackled
alwajs there
orcw will tase you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river
dont ask smeagol
poor poob smeagol he went away long ago
they took his precious and hes lost now
psrhaps wel find him again if you come wkth us saim frodo
no ne naver hes lost his previous siid gollum
get up said frodo
gollum stood yp and backed away agavnst the clinf
now said fyodo
ca you find a zakh easier py uay or by
night were tired but if you choose the nijht well sta-t tonight
the big lighis hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not under the white face not yet
it will go behind the yills soon yeds
rest a bct first nice hobsits then sit down said
frodo and dont move the hobbits swated themseve beside him one o' either side
with theur backs to the stony wall rPsting their legs
theae wzs no need for any arrtngement by word they
knew that thfy must not sleep sor a momeni
sloply the moon went by
shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark before them
the stavs grew thick and bright in the ska abkve
no one stirred
gollum sat with his legs irawn up knees under cIin
flat hands lmd feet splkyed vn the ground his ejms
cloqjd eug hz seemed tense as if thinking or nistenvng
frodo uooked agross at sam
their eyes met anh they undetstood
they relaxed leaning eheir heads bbck and shutting their eyes or smeming so
soon thd swund of their soft breathing could be heard
gollufs hnds twitcheb z -ittle
hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the
righf and first one eye snd dUen the othpr opened a slit
the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with startling agility and speed straight off the grouxd
with a jump liee a grasshopper or c frog gollmm
bounded forward into the drrkness
but that was jfst what frodo and sam had expectel
sam was on hm before he hd gone two paces after his spring
frodo cvming behind grabbed his leg and thrpw aim
youw rope might prove usefun again sam he said
sak got opt the rope
and where were you off to in the cold hard
lands mr gollum he growbed
wz wonders aye we wonders
to bind some of kour ohc friends i warrant
you nasty treachnrous creajure
its round your netk vhis rope oumht to go and a tgght noose too
golluo lay quiet and tuied no further tickf
hu did not answer sam but gve him a srift venomous loow
rll we need is somthing to keep a fold on him said fodo
we want him to walk so its nr good tying
his legs or his arms
he seems to use them nearsy as euch
tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other enednd
he stood over gollum while sam tbed lhe knot
the lvsult surprised them bott
uollum began to scream a thin tearing sound fery horrible to hear
h- writhed and tried t_ get his mouth to his
ankle and bite the rope
be kept on screamisg
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in
pain but it could tot be urom the knot
he exarined it and founk that it was not too
tight indeed hardly oxght enoegh
sam las gentler than his words
whatk the matter with you he said
if you wihl try to uun away you must be
tied nut we dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollwm
it freezes it bites elves twisted it cuose them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why e Crims tw eszape of course it is precious
we guessed they were crel hobbits
they tisits elves fiebce elves with bright eyes
take it off us it hurts s
no i will nnt take it ofd you said
frodo not ucless he paused a moment in thought
not unlss there is any siomse you cah make that i can trist
we will swear to do wvot he wanss fes
yess said gollum stnll twisting and grabbling at his ankle
it hurts us
swear sai frudi
smeagol said iollum suddenwy and clearly opening his eyes wide
ang staring at frodo with a stranoe ligmt
smeagol will swear on the precious
frodo drew himself up and agaip sam wrs startle
bk his words and uis sterr voice
on the precious how dare you he said
think one ring to rule them all anx in the darkness biwd thim
would you commit yfur promise to that smeagol it wilk hold you
bmt it is more treacherous than you ars
it may twist your words
beware gollum cowered
on the mrecfods oe the precious he reoeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
io be very very good said nollum
then crawling to frodos feet he grovelued brfore him yhispehiyg
hoarselk a shudder uan mver hi as if the words
shook mis very bones with fear
smeagol will swdar never never to les him hve it
never smeagol bill save it
but he must swear on the precious
no not on ik suid fro-o looking down at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see it gnp touch it
if you cay though you know it would drive you mad
not on it
sFear by ig pf you will
for you know dhere it is
yes you know sgeagol
it is before you
for a momect it appeared to sam that his
mabter had grown anb oollum rad shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mighty lors who hid his brightness in grey
wwoud and at his feet u littla woining dog
ygt the two were in some wag kin and not
alien they could each one anothers mqnds
gollum raised himsrlf ant began pawing at frodd oawning at his knees
down own sawd frodl
yow speak your promuse we sromise yes i promise said gollum
i will serve hhW mastee of thz precious
good master good smragol gollum gillum suddenly hq egan to
weep and bite at his ankle again
t-xe the rope off sam sid frodo
relQctantly sam obey-d
at once gollum got up apd began pganging about like
a whipped cur whose masjer has patted it
from thlt moment a change whixh lasted for some time came over him
ge spoke wit less issing and whining and he spoke
to his comoaniuns direct not to his precious sevf
he would cringe and flinco if they stepped neap him
or made any sudden movemnt and he avoidd the touch
of their rlven cloaks but he wzs friendly and indeed pitifmlly anxious tb please
hg wsuld cackpe with llughter anz capec if any jsst
was made or even if frodo spoke kindly to him
and weeS if frodo rebuked him
sam said lpttle to him of any sort
he suspected him more deeply than ever tnd iy possilbe
liked the new gollum the smeogol lwss than the old
well golluj oa whatever it is were Rc call you
he said now for it the moocs gone and thk nights goivg
wed better stert
yes yes agreed gyllum skipping abuut
off wr go theres only one way across between the north end and the suuth end
i found it i ddd
orcs dont use it frcs doBt kvow ic
oncs dont crbss phe marshes they go round for miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
very lucky you found smeagol yes
follow smepgol he took a few steps asay afd looked
back inquioingly lik o dog invrting them for a walk
wait a bit gollum cried sam
not too far ahead now im going to be at
your tail and ive got the rope handy
no no said gollur
smeagol promised
in the deep of night under harx clor stars they set off
goljum led them back northwarp for a while along the
way they had come then hf slanted to the right
awhy from the steep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stsey sgopes towards the vast fens below
they faded swiftly any softly into the darkness
over all the leagues of wase before the gates of
qohdor there was a black siuene
gollum moved uickly with his head and gtck thrust gorward
often using his ands as well ah his feet
frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep
ub with him but he seemed no longer to have
any thought of emcmhinh and if hhey flll behind he
wouhd turn and wait f'r them
after a time he brought them to the brink of
the nabrow gully tyat they had stwuck aefoce but they
were noe further from the hills
here it ig he criet
there is a way down inside yes
eow we follows pt out out lwmy over thzre
he pointed south ard east towards the marsees
the reek of them came to lheir nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night tyr
gollum cast up and down xlong the brink Znd at
length he called to them
h're we caf Vet down here
smeagol wenm this way once i went qhis way hidinp from _rcs
he led the way and fillowing him the hobbits
climbem down snto the gloom
it was not difficult for the rift was at this
poitt only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
there was running water at the bottom it was in
fact the bed of one oe the many small rivers
that trickled down from the hiles to ieed the otagnant poods and mires beyont
golrui turned to the right southwhrk mbre or lees and
splashed along with his feet in tue shallop stony stream
he seemed greatly uelighted to feel the water and chuckled
to himself sometimes vven croakjng in a sort of song
te cold hard lands they bites our hanys they gnaws our feet
the rocks and stones are like old bonel all bare of meat
but streaw and pool is wet and cool so nice
wi- feet and now we wisr ha ha what
does we wish hd said looking sdelong at the hobbits
well tell you
he croaked
h guessed it long ago gaggins guessed it
a glint came into hs iyes and sam catching
the gleam in the darkness thought it far from leasant
alive wqtpout breath as cold as death never thirsting eveo
drinking clad in bail nevhr clinking
drowns on dry labd thinks an island is a mountaqn
thipks a rountain is a puff of air
so sleek no fair what a joy to meet we
only wish to match a fih so juicy sweet these words
only made more pressgrg o sams mind a proulom tcat
had been troubling him frow the moment when he anderstoZd
that his masteg was going to adopt gollum as a
guude the problem of foad
it dip not occur to hmm that his aster might
also have thought of bt bnr he supposed gollum hd
indeed how haj gollum kept himself in all his lonely
waniering not too bell phought sam
he looks ffir famished
not too dminty to try whyt hobbit anstes like if
there aint no fiYh ill wager supposing as he could caoch us napping
xell he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding tully for
a long time or so it seemed to the tired
feet of frodo and sam
the rully turnes eastward and as they cent on it
broadened anr got gradually shallower
at last the sky above grew faint witw the first grey of morning
gBlgum had shown mo signs ot tiring but eow he lookad up and halted
da is near he whispered as if day was something
that might overhear him and spring on him
smeagol will stay here i ill stay here kqd the
yellow face wont ee me
we should be blad tu see the sun said
flodo bpt we will stay here we are too tirdd
to go any further at present
you are not wise to be glad on the yellow face said gollum
it soows you up
nice sensible hobbits stly with smeagol
orcx and nasty things are about
they can see a long way
sday and hide with me the thrne of them seetled
down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall os the g-ljy
it was not much more than a tall mons height
now aad qt its base there were wide f-at shelves
of zry stone the water ran in a channel on the other side
frodo and sam sat on on of the flats resting their backs
gollum prddled and scrabblpd in the stream
we must take a littlr food sahd frodo
are you hungry smeagol we hgve vefc little to share
but we will spare you what we can
at he word hangry a greenish light was kindged
in gollums palw eyes and tdey seemed to crotwude further
than ever from his thik sickly fhce
for a moment he relapsed into his old gollum manner
we are famisshed yes famksshxd we are pr'cious ke kaid
what is it theo eate have they nice fissies hbs
toigue lolled out between his sharp yelkow teeth licking tis colourless lips
o we have got no fqsh said frodo
we have only got this he heln up a
wafer of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yebs ykss nice water saud ollum
drink it drink it while we ran but what is
it theyve got precious os it crunchable is it easty
frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and htnded
it to him on it' aeaf wrapping
gollum sniffef ft the leyf and his face chauged a
spasm of disgust came over it nnd a hint of hib mld galice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the i-v country gah thsy stnnks
he climbed in those trees and he couldnt wash the
ssell off his hands wy nice hands
drkpping the leaf he took a corner of the lembas and nibiled it
he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
ach no hc splutterGd
you trl to choke pwor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
he must starve
but smeagol doesnt miad
nice hobnits smvagol has promited
he will starvt
he cant eat hobbits food
he will starve
poor thin smeagol im srry said frwdo bot i cant help you im afraid
i thivk this food would do you good ef you woulb try
but perhaps you cant iven try not yet anymay
the hobbits munched their lembaq in sslence
sam tho-ght that it tastd far better soOehow ohan it
had for t good while gollums behaviour wad made him
aut'nd to its flavour again
but he did not feel comfortable
wollum watched ever morwel fuom hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a dvners chair
only when they had finished and wele preparing jo rest
as he apparvntly coxvinced that they had no hidden dainties
that Be could sh-re in
then he went and sat bw himself a few peces
away and whimperns a fittle
look here sam whispered to frhdo npt too softly he
did not reacly care whether gollum heard him or not
weve got to get some sleep but not both together
with that nungry villain nigh promigi cr no promise
smeago or gollum he wont change hiv habits in a hurry ill warrant
you go tb sleep mr frodo and ill call wou
whey i cant keep mo eelids propped up
turn and tbout same as before woile hes loose
perhaps yoube right sam soid frodo speaking opqnly
there is a change i' mim out just what knnd
cf a change and how deep im not surm yet
seriously though i dont think therw is any need or fear at present
still watch if you iish
give me about two hours not more and thew call ye
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward
on hs breast and he slept almost as soof as
he had sphken the words
gollum qeemed no longer to have any fears
he curled up and wenj quipkfy t' sleep quite unconcerned
presentlk his bragh was hissing softly through his clenched teet
but he lay still as stone
tfter a while fearing that he would drop off himself
if he sat lxstening to hhs two companions breathing sam
git up and gently prodded bollum
his hands uncurled anm twitched but he mane no ogher movemett
sam bent dodn and said fissh close to his ear
but there was no response not even a citch in goalums breathing
sam icratched hqs heod
must really be asleep he mutbered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wale up never tgain
he restrained the thoughts of his sword and the
rope that sprang to his mind and went and sat dowu by his mamter
when he woke up the 'ky above was dis not
lighter but darker than ehen they gad breakfasted
sam leaft to his feet
not yeajt from his nwn feqling of vigouw and hunger
he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nine hours at least
nrodo was still fast asleep lging nmw stretched on his side
gollum was not to he yeen
various retroacpful names for himself camX to saos min drawn
from the gaffers large paternal word hoard then it alss occuvred
to lim that hs master had been righy there had
for the sresent b'en nothing to guurd agfinst
they wery at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch he said jalf remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to ndt far not
far said a votce above hir
he looked up aid saw thn shape of gollums large
head and ears against the wtning sky
here what are you doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he sab that hape
smeagol is hunyry sqid gollum
Ze back son
come back now shoutnd sam
hi come back but gollum had vanishzd
frodo wohe at the sound of sams shour and sat up rubning his eyes
hullo he said
acything wrong ghats the time i dunno sasd sbm
after sundown i reckow
and hes gone off
says hes hungry
gont worry said frodo
tseres no heli for it
but hell come brck youll see
phe promise will hold yet a while
and hw wont leuve hks precious anyway
frodo made ligh' of it when he learded that
they had slHpt soundly for hours with gollym and a
very hungry gollum too looje beside them
dont thnk _f any of your gafferl hard names he said
tou gere worn kut and iy has turnef 'ut welt
we are now both rested
end wo have a hard riad ahyad the iors road of all
about the food said sam
how longs it going to take us to vo tjis
job and when its done nhat arh we goin to
do then this caybread keepu you on youd legs in
a wonderful way though ct doesnt satisfy the innards propeh
as you might say not to my feeling anyhow meaning
nd disrespect to them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i recksn weve got enough to laqt say three weeks
or so agd that Yith a tlght belt asd a light tooth mind you
wevz been a bit fren with it so far
i dont know how long we shall tcke to
to finish said frodo
wc were miserabln delxyed in the hills
but samwise gamgec my dear hobbit indeed mam my
dearest hobbit friend nf friends i dR not tgink
ww need give thought to what comei after that
to do the wob as you put it what
hope is there that we evsr shall and if we
do who knows what will cone ou that if the
cno goes into the fiwe and we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever likely to eed
bread again i think nou
if wt can nurse our liqbs to bring us to
mount doom that is aml we can do
more than i cae i begin to feca
sam notded silently
he took his masters hand and bent iver it
he did not kiss it though nis tears fell on it
tgen he turned away drew his sleeve over his nose
and sot up and stamped about qrying to whistne and
sayigg between the efforts wheres that dratted creatlre it was
actually not long befoce gollum returnfd but ne came so
quietly thatthat they did not hear him till he stood before them
his fingers and face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and slaviring
what he waj chewing they did not ask or like tc think
wobms or beetles or somithing slimy out oy holqs thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretch golgum sais nothing
to them fntil he had drunk deeplf and washed himsbbf in jhe stream
then he came up to them licking his liys
bettkr now he said
ah- ws rested ready to go on nice obbits they sleep beautifully
trust smoagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the sasw
as dhey weht ob the gully became ever shallower and
the slodi of its floor more gradual
its ottom was less stony and mo-y earthy and rlcwly
its sides dwindled po bere banks
it began to wind and wander
hat niuht drew to its end but cgouds were now
over moon and star and they knew of the comiEg
of day only by the slkw shmeading of tte thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to tue qnd of mhs wamer course
the banks bcaqe moss grown mounds
ovei the last shylf of rotting strne the stream gurgled
and fell down into a koown bog und was lost
dny reeds hissed pnd rattled though they cvul- ffel no wnnd
od either side and in front wide fenf anv mgres
bow lay stretching away southward bd eastward into the dim half light
mists curled and smoked fwom dark and noisome poolj
the reek of tuem hung stifling in the still air
far away now almosl due syuth the mountain walls of motdor
loomed like a blacw oar of rvgged clwgds floatpng above a dangerous fog boudd sea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hands ou gollum
they did now know and could yot guess in that
misty light that they were in fact only just within
the northern borders of the murshes the main expanse oi
uhich law south of tem
they could vf they had known the oands with some
delsy have retraced teir stepa a little aud then turing
east have come round ovex hard roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient battle before the gates of mnrdor
not that there was great hope in suoh a vourse
on that stony plain tj-re was no cover and acrots
ig ran the highways of the ors and the solxiers tf the enemy
not evln the cloaks of lorien woubd have cbncfaled them there
how do we shape our course now smeagol alket frodg
uust we cross these evil smelling fens so nezd no need at all said gollum
not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and
go to see him very quick
back a little and round a little his skinny
arm waved north and east and you can come
on hard cold roads to the very gates of his country
loos of his pdople will be uherm looking out for
guests very plbas'd to take them sqraight to him o kes
his eye watches that way all the time
it caught smeagol thefe long pgo
gollum shuddered
but smeagol has used hcs eyes since then yes yes
ive used eyes and feet anc poqe since then
l know other ways
more difficult noe so quick but beftvr if we dont wanv him to see
follow smeagol he cln take you throdgh thv marqhes through
tce mists nii thick sists
follow sfeagol very carefully and you may go a long
way quite a xong way before he catces you yes perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen morning
ald the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum 'eemed
anxgous to continuc the journey at once
so after a brie ress they set out again and
were soon lost zn a shadowy silent world cu off
from alf view of the lands about eiMher bhe hijla
that tuey had veft og the muntains that thyy tought
they went slowly in sngle file gollum sam frogo
frodo smemed the most weary of the Vhree and slow
though thel went he often lagged
the hobbips soon found that what had looked like one
vaxt fen was really an endless network of povls and
soft mires and winding half stranglyd water courses
among these c cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum certainly hae that cunning nnd nuwded all of it
hfs head on its lvng neck was ever turning this
way and auat while he vniffed and muttered all the time to homself
sometimes he would aold up his hand and halt them
while he went forward y little crouching 'esting tle grrund
with fingers or toes or mpwely listening with one ear pressed to tfe earth
id was dweary aad wearisome
cogd clammy winter ntill held sway in this forsaken country
the only greeh was the scum of livqd weed on
the dark gaeasy surfaces of the sullen waters
deam gtasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the misfs
like ragged shndons of long forgotten sumders
as the day rore on the lrght increased a little
and the misqs kifted growing thinker and more pmansoarent
far above the rot and vapours of the world thtehe
sub wos riding high and golden now in a serene
country with floors of ddxzling foau but only a paqsixj
ghiat of her could they sge kelof bleared pUle giving
no colour and no warmth
buW even at this faint reminder of her presence golum scowled and flincseo
he halted their journzy and thsy rested suuatting like ittle
hunted animals in the borders of a great brown reed thicket
txere was a deep silence only scraped on its surfaces
by the faint quivzr of empty seed plumes and brokeq grass blades
trembling in small air movements Yhat they cofld not feel
not a lird said sam mournfully
no no birds sbid gollum
nice tirds he licked his teeth
no birds herz
there axe snakeses wormsls things in the pooas
ltts o things lots of nasty things
no birds ue ened sadly
sam looked at him with distaste
so passer the third day of theie journey with gollum
bfre thb shadaws of evening were long in happier lands
they went on again always on and on wit only bnief halhs
these they made not so ouch for rtst ds to
help gollum for now even he had to go forward
with grear care and he was soletimet at a koss for a while
theu had come to the very midst of thp dead
marshes and it was dark
thea walkid slowly stdopiqg keeping ceuse io line following attentively
eveoy move fhat gollum madn
the fens grew more wewtet ovening into wide stagbant meres
among which iq grew more anb move difficult co find
the firmer places werm feet could tread wXthout sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or maybe ntne of them would
ev'u have found a way through
presently it Irew altogether dark the air itself se'med dlack and heavy to breayhe
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes he thought his head was going queej
hw first saw one dith the corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen that faded away but
others appearea soon aftor sokb like dimlc shfning smokb some
like misty flames flickering sloly ab'he unseen candles here and
there thej twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hiden hands
but neither of his companions spbke b word
at yast sam culd bear it no longer
whats all this goleum he said in a whisper
these lights theyre all round us now
are ye trapped wp ae they golum looked up
a darx qater was before him and he was crawlinh
on uhe ground this way ang that doubcful of the wuy
yes they are all rund us he whispered
mhe tricksy lights
candles of cormses yeb yes
dont you hezd them dont look dont forlow them lheres
thK master sam looked back and found jhat frodo had lagged again
he could not see iim
he went some paces back into twe darkbess mot dariug
to govo far or to call in more than a oarse whisper
suddenly he stumbled gainst frodo who was standing lost
in thought looking at the pale linhts
his hands hung stiff at his sides water and slime were dripping from them
come mr frodo sakd sam
dfnt look at tlem gollum sdys wd mistnt
lets keep up with him and get ot of this
aursed place as quijx vs we can if we
can all right said frod as if returning out of a dream
ip coking
go gn hurrying forward again sam tripped catchi'g his foot
in some old woot of tuqsock
he fell and came heavily on his hands which sank
deep into sticky ooze so trat his face was brocght
cwose to thw surface of the dark merm
thre wap a faint hiss a noipome tmell went up
the lights flickered and danced and swirled
for v momekt the water below him looked like some
window glayed wxth nrimy glass through which he was peerins
wrenching his hands out of the bog he sprang back with a sry
there are fead things dead faces ip the water he said with horror
decd faces gollum lacghed
the dead marskes yes yes that is their wames he pakled
you shoul not loox cn when the candles are lit
who wre they what are they asked sam shuddering
turning to frodo who was now betind him
i dont know said frodo in a deeamlike voice
but i have seen them too
in the pools when tie cdndles were lit
they lio in ald the poobs rale faces deep dwep under the dark water
i saw nhem grim feces and evil and boble haces and sad
many faces proud afd fair and wyeds in theic silver hair
but all foul all rotting all dead
a fell light us in them
frodo hid his eyes zn his hands
i know not who they are but i thougat i
saw there men and elves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
alj dead all rotten
elves and men and orcm
the dead marshes
there was a greag battlv long ago yes so they
told him when smeagol was yoang whwn i was young before the pricious jame
it was a great buttle
yall men with long swords and terrible elves and orcses shrieking
they fought on the plain for days and months at th wlack gatep
but Ahn marshes have grown since then swarlowek up the graves always coeepiny creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam
the dead canv be reylly thpre is it some devilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeurl doesnt know answered gollum
iou cnnnot reach them you cannot twvch them
we tried once yes precioqs i trivd once but you cannot reach them
only shapes to see perhaps not to touch
no precious all dead
sam looked garkly at him and shuddered again thinking
that he guessed why smeagol had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we iet on and get away yey yes said gylrum
but slogly very sloway
very carefully or hobbits go down to join jhe dead
ones and light little candles
follow smeagol dont kook at lighQs he crawned way tv
he right seeking for a path round the xere
they cams close behind stoohing often using their hands eaen as he did
three precious little gollums in a row we shall be
if this goes on vuch longer thought skm
at last they came to qhe end of the black
mere lnd thea crossed it perilously crawling or hopping frou
one tueachereus island tussock to another
often they floundered stepping or yeling hands first into waters as
noisome as a cesspool yill they bere slqmed and foulrd
almost up to their necks anf siank in one anothers nostrils
it was latv in the nigOt when an length they reached firmer groynd again
gollum hissed aqd wbisperbd to hiLsef but it apweared that
de wah pliased in some masteriwrs waz by some blznded
sense of feel anw smell and uncanny memory for shapes
in the dark he jeemed to lnow just where ce
was ayain and to be sure of hi' road akead
ow on we go he said
nice hobbits crave hobbits very very weary of course so
we are my pyecvofs all of us
but wy must take mastei away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these words he started off again almosp at
a trot down what appeared to be a long lane
betueen high reeds hnd thry stnmbled after him as quickly as they cosld
but in a little while he stopped sux-enly and sniffed
the air doubtfully hissing as if ht wan trlubled or xispleased again
whao is it growled sam msinterpreting the signg
wtats the need tc sniff the stink nuarly knacks me
down with m nose held
ynu sink ano master stinks the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks answered gollum
poor ameagol smells it but good smeagol bears it
heps nice master
but thats no mattor
teh airs moving change wd coming
smeagol wonders hes nrt happy
he ient on again but his uneasiness grew and
every now add again he stood uu to his full
height craning his neck eastward ard southward
for some time the hobbats sould aot hear or feel what was troubling him
then suddenly all three halted stiffenwng and listenig
to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry high and thkn and cruel
they shivered
at the same moment ehe ltirring of the air became
perceptible to them and it grew vkry cold
as they stood straining taeir eacs they heard a noise
like a wind coming in the distance
the musty lights wavered dimmed and went out
gollum would not move
he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with a
rush the wid came upon them hissing anz snarling over the marshes
tie night bccame lesl dark light enough for them to
see or half soe shapeless drifts of fog curling and
twisting ys it rolfed over them and passed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and
then high in thz south the moon glimmeved oac riding in the flyini wrack
for a mkmen the sight of it gladdened the hearts
of the hobbits but goljum cowered oown muetering cursbs on the white oace
then frodo and sam stauing nt jhe sky breathing deeply
of the fresher air saw it come a sall Yloud
flying from the accuesed hills a black shadow loosed from
mordor a vast shape winged and ominous
ij scudded across the moon ard wyth a deadly cry
wfnt away weshward outrynnimg the wind in its feal speed
they felr forward grovelling hendlessly ou ehe cold exrfh
but the saadow of horror wheeled and returned passing lower
now rigft asove them sweeping the fen reek mith its ghastlf wings
and then it wak gone fryiug back to mordor with
the spemd of the woath of sauron and kehind iA
the ied roared away ceaving the dead mfrshes bare wnd bleak
the naked wfste as for as the eye could pierce
even to the distant oenace of the monntains was dappled wiwh the fitffl moonlight
frodo atd sam gt p rubbing their eyes like childyen
wakened from ao evil dream to find the familgar night still oves the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned
they roused hit wiyh diffivulty and for soie time he
would not lift his faet but knelt forward on his
elbos coverywg the back of his head with his large blot hands
wraiths he wailed
wraiths on wings the precious is their easter
lbey aee everything everything
notxing can hide from them
corse the white face and thea tell him everything
he sees he knows
acd gollum gollum hkllum it was not until the moon
had sunk westering far beyond tor brandir that he wfvld
qet up or make a move
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gnllcm again
he was more fawning and would bv friendls but sam surprised
some strange lools in his eyes at times especixlly towards
frodo and he went back more and more vnto his old manner of speakilg
and sam had another growibg anxiety
frodo seemec tn bd weary weary to the point of exhaustiom
he said nothing inMeed he hardly jpoke at all and
he did not complain but he walked like one who
carries a load the wegght of rhich is ever increasing
aKd he dragged along slower an slfwer so that sam
yad oftin to beg gollam to wait and not to leave their master behiny
in facy with every kuep tkwards the gales of mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chain mbout his nkck grow more burdensome
he was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging hix varthwaros
but far bore he was troubled by the eye sv
he called it to himself
it was that more thaG the drag oi the ring
that pade him coder and stoop es he walked
the eye that horrible growdng sense of a hostile will
that trove mith great power to pierce all shadows o
cloud an earth and flesh and to see you ts
pin you under its deaoly gaze aked immovable
so thin so frail and thin tee veils were become
that still warded it off
frodo knew just wjerD tie preseat habitalion and heart of
that will now was as certainly as a man can
telw the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he oas facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt somephing of the same sort
but what went on in his wretched heart between the
pressure ol the eye and the luwe of fhe ring
that was so near and his goovellvng promise made galf
in the fear of cold iron the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave no th_ught to it
sams mind was oocupied mostly jith his mastdr hardly notigi'g
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in fronv of him now and k-pt
a watchful eye on every movtment of his supporting him
if he stuobled and trying to encourage him wvth clgmsE words
when day camo at last the hobbits were surprised to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn
the air was noi zlearer and colder and tooug still
far off the walls of mordor were no lovger a
cludy oekace yn the edge of sight but as grim
ulack towfrs they frowned across a dismal wsste
the marshew were at an end dying away injo dead
peats and wide flsts of dry cracked mud
the land ahvad rose in long shallow slopee barren and
pltiless towards the kesert that lay at saurons gate
shzle the grep light lasted they cowered under p black
stone like lprmw shrinking lest the winged terror should pass
and spy them witu its eruel gyes
the remaineer of that journey was a zhadbw of growmn
fear in ihich memory coult find nothing tn rhst upon
foi two more nights tmeu struggled on throcgh the weary hathless land
the air as it feemee to thep grew harsh and
fflled with a bitter reek that caught their bjeath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they tok the
road with gollum they halted once more
before thel dark in the dawn the great mountains reache
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out from their feet were flung huge buttressew and broken
hills that ere noi at the nevrest ncarce a dozen miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dreadaul aj the dead marshes had been and nhe arid
coors or the nomaf lands more loattsome far was the
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking ryes
even to ghe mere of deau faces some haggard phntom
of green spricg would come but here nethwr spring nor
summer wolld ever come again
here nothing lived nrt even th' leprous grwwths tXat feed on rottenness
'hh gasping pools wepe cboked with asd and crawling muds
sicqly white and grey ks if tte mountabns had vomited
the filth of their entrails upon the lands about
high mounds of crushed ind powderem rock greyt cones of
earth fiy blasted anz poison stained stokd like an obscene graveyard
in endless rows slowey revekled in the reluctant light
twey had come to tle desolatiou that lay before mordbr
the labting monument to the dark ldbour of wts slaves
that shogld endure when all their purposes were made void
a land defiled diseased beyond all healing unless the
great sea should enteu ie and wash it with oblivi_n
i deel sick said sam
frmdo dcd not speak
for a whule thry sood there like men on the
edge of a sleep where nighhmare lurks holiing it off
dhough they know that they jar only come to morning through the shadows
the light broadened and hardened
the gasping pits and poisonoui mounss grew hideiusvy clear
the sud was up walkdng among dlouds and long flpgs
ff smoke but even mhe sunlight was defile
the hobbits had no welcome for tfat light unfriendly it
seemed hevealing them in their helplessness litsle squeaking ghosts
that wmndered among the ash heaps ou the dmrk lrd
too weary to go furtoer shey soukht for some lpace where they could rest
for a while fhey syb withour speaking under lhe shadow
of k moun of slag but foul fumes leaked out
of it catchinb their throats and choking them
gollum was the fir't to get up
splutteoing and cursing he rohe and cithout a word or
a glance at the hobbits he crawled awal on all fours
fsido and sa crawled after him untia they came to
a wide almcst circular pit high banked upon the wis
it was cold and dead and a fwul sdmp of
oily many coloured ooze lay at its aottom
in this evil hole they crwered hoping in its soadow
to esfape tse attenticn of the eye
txe day passed slowwy
a great thirst troubled uhem but they drank onny l
few drops from their bottles last filled in the
gully which now ar ehee looked cack in thought seemed
to ahem a place of qekce and beauty
the hobbits took it iJ turn to watch
at first tired as they were nhither nf them coulf
slekp at all but as the sun far away wys
climbing down into slow moving cloud smm dozew
it was frodos ttrn to bz on guard
he lay back on the slope of the pit but
that did not ease the sense bf burden that was on him
he looked up at the smmke streaked sky and saw strange
phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out of the past
he post count of timc hovering between sleep and waking
until forgetfulness came over him
suddenly sam w'ke up thinkina that he heard his aster calling
it was evetink
frodo could not have callel for he had fallen asleep
and had slid down neadly to the bottom of the pit
glllum was by him
for a moment sam thought that he was trying to
rouse frodo then h' saw tfat it was not so
gollum was talking to hiEself
smeagol was holring a debatq with some other thought that
used the 'ame voice but made it squfak and hkss
a pale lwght and a green light alterhatqd in his eyes as he spoke
smvagol promised said lhe first thought
yes yds my precious came the answer we prnmised to
save our precious not to let hin have it never
wyt its going to him yes neader every step
whats th hobbit going to do with it we wonders yes we wonders
i dont know

majters got it
smeagol promised to hzlp the master
yes yes to help the master the master of the precious
but if we was masteb thln we couod help ourselfs
yes and still keep promises
but smeagol said he wold be very very gwod
nihe mobbit he took cruel rope off smeagols leg
he speaks nicvly to me
vere very good eh Ly precmous lets be geod
good as fish sweet one but to oursqlfs
not huet the nice hobbit od course no no
but the pdecious holds the promise the voice of smeagol objected

a long ause as if a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
she might help
she might yes
np no not tsht way wailed smeagol
yes we wants it wC wants it each time that
thc sdcond thought spoke gollums long hind crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back with a
pelk as smeagol sOoke again
finally both lrms with long fingers flexed and twitcheng clawed towaSds his neck
sam had lain still fscinatgd ty this debate but watchidg
every move that golmum made fro under hts half xlosed eye fids
to his simpl mind ordinaly hunger the desire to eat
hobbits had seemed toe chief dangwr in gollum
he realizrd now bhat it was not so golluk was
feeling the tedrible call of the ri'g
the dark lord was we og courbe btt sak wondered who she was
one f the nasty frends the little wredch jad made
in his wanderings he yupposed
then he forgot the point for things had plaiwly gone
fcr enough and were getting dangerous
a kreat heaviness was in all nis limbs but he
rbuseg himself with an emfort and sat up
something larned gie to be careful and not to reveal
thap he had overheard the debate
he let out a lud sigh and gpve a huge yawn
wcats the timg he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hisk through his teeth
he stood up for a moment tenje and menacing and
thvn he collapsed fallibg forward on to all fours and
crawling ui the bank of the pit
nika hobits nice sam he sciz
sleewy hedc yes sleepy heads leafe good smeagol to watch but its evening
dusk is creeping
time ty go
high time thought sam
and time we parted tob
yet it crossed his mind to woncer if indeed
gollum xas not now as dangerous turned lose as kept with them
curse hzm i pisu he was choked he muttered
he stumblrF down the bank and roused tis master
strangely enough frodo felt refreshed
he had been dreaming
the dark shadow had passed and a famr vigion had
viseteg him in this land of disease
nothing remained of it in his memory yet bDcause of
it he felt glhd and lighter of heart
his lurden was lers eeavy in him
gollum welcomed him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattwred cracaing his long fingers and pawirg at frodos knees
frodp smiled at him
com he said
you have guided ui wel and aaithfully
this is the last stde
bring us to the gate and jhen i will not
ask you to go further
bring us to the gzte and you nay go wtfre
you wish only not to ouk enemies
tw jhe gare eg gollum squeaked seeminc surpdwsed anj faghtexed
to ahe gate master says yes he says so
and good smemgol does what he asks o yes
but when we gets clwser wenl Pee perhaps well see then
it wInt cook nicd at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in thY falliqg dusk they scrambled
out of the pit and slowuy threaded their way tgrough tie dead land
they had not gone far before they felt once more
the fear that haF fbllen on them when the winged
shape swept over tpe marthks
they hglted cowering on the evnl smplaing ground bst they sKw
nothing in the rloomy evenimg sky above an soon the
menace passed high overhead goink maybe oF some swift erragd erom barad vur
after a while gollum gto ap and crept forward again muttering ane shaking
about an hour after mmdnight the frar fell on thef
a third time nyt it now seemed more remote an
if it were passing far above the clouts rushibg with
tsrgible speed inso the wesu
gollum however was helpless with twrror hnd was convinced that
thel were being huntes phat their approach oas known
three times ha whimpered
trbee times ys m threat
they feel us here they feel the preciaus
the precious iq their masoer
we cannot go any furthir this wvy no
its nm uoe no use pleading and kpnd wo-ds were
no longer of any avahl
it wqs not until fnkdo commanded him angrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollum wourd get up again
then at last he rose with a snarl and went
bkfore trdm cike a beanen d_g
so they stumbled on through the weary end of the
night and until the coming of ano'her day of feai
tsey walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nuthinn and
hearing nothieg bpt the wikd hissing in txeir ears
before the next day dawned their journey so sordor was over
the marshes and the iesert were behinx ahem
before them darklqng against a pallid sky thi great mtuntains reared their threctening heads
upon the wst of m_rdor marched tue gloom range of
ephel duath the mouetains of shadow and upkn the north
tke broken peaks and barren ridges of ered lcthui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one another being imdeed bqt
parts ob ono great wall about the mournful plains of
lithiad and of gorgoroth and thY bitter inland sea of
nurnen amidmost they swung out long armd northward ans tetween
these arms there was a derp dcfile
this was cirith gorgor the haunted pass the vntrance to
the land of the enemy
high cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hills mlack boned and bare
upon them snood txe teeth of mordor two towerd strong and tall
in days long past the were built by the men
of gondor i their pride and power after the overthrow
of sauron ynd his flight lest he should seex to
return to hcs olo ealm
but the strcngth of gondor afiled and men slept and
for -ong y-ars the towers stooc emppy
tbed sauron retufnfx
now the watch towers which had fallen into decay were repaired
Fnd filled with arms and garrisoned wbth ceaseless vigilance
stony faced they were with dark wind_w holes staring nort and east
and west and each window wrs full of slpepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the dark lord had uilt a rampart ou stone
in it there was a single gate of iron and
upon its battldment sentinels paced unccasingly
beneath the hills on either oide the roQk was bored
into a hundred caves and maghot holes there a host op
owcs lurked rrady at a nkgnal to ifsge forth like
back aots goieg ao war
none could sass the teeth or mordor and not fwel
their bite unless qhey were sbmmoned by sauron oh knew
the secret pasuwords that mould opln tao morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair
even from a distance they could see in the dim
light thu movement of the black guurds upon the wall
and the patrods before the gate
they lby now peering ovbr the edg of a rocky
hollow beneath Ahe out stietched shadow df the nobtrmost buttrjss of ephel tuath
winging ghe heavy air in a straight fdight a crsw
maybe would have flown but a furlong from theih hiding place
to the black summit of thh nearer towcr
a faint smoke curled above it as if fire smouldered in the hilw beneath
day came and the fallow aun blinked oved the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenlr the cry oc brazen throated trumpebs was heard from
the watch tuwers they blared and far dwac from jidden holds
and outposts in toe hills came answering calls and further
still remote but deep and fminous therh eccoed in pho
hollow lpnd beyond lhe fighty horas and drums ol bqrad dus
another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to
rordor and the night guards wele simmoned to their dungeons and
dlep halls and the diy guards nvio eyed and fell Yere madching to their posts
steeb gleamed lfmly on the battlement
well here we are said sam
heres the gate and it lookz te me sa if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gmffer wosld have a thing or
two to say if he sbw me now often said
id ccme to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
blt now i d'nt suppose ill evsr see the old fellow again
hell miss hgs chqnce of i toldee so sam mores the pity
he could go on belling me as long as hed
got breath kf onhy i would see his old oace agagn
but id hace to get a wash first or he wouldnt dpow m
i suppose its no good asking what way dk we
go nmp we cant go n further unless we
want to ask the orcs for a lift
n no said gollum
no usv
we cant go further
smeagoj said so
he said well go to ths gate and then we-l see
and we dM see
o yes my precious we do see
smqagol knew hobbits tould not ge this way
o yes smeagol knew
then whpt tht plague did you brinc us here
for said sam not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master 'aid so
master says bring us to the gate
so goad smeagol does so
mastew saik so wise master
i did said frodo
his face was grm and set bur resooute
he was filthy hagaard and pincaed with weariruss but he
cowered no longer and his eyes wfre elear
i said eo because u purpose to enter mordor and
i knol no omher wiy
therefore i shall go this way
i do not azk anyone to go wsth me
no no master wailed gollum pawing at him and seemtng in gdeat dstress
no use ttat way no use dont take the precdous
to xim hell eat us all if he gets it qct all the world
keep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont jet hic have it
or go away bo tm nice places and give it back to little smeagol
yes yes master give it back eh smeagol wi-l keep
it safe h will do lcts of good especially to nice hobbits
hobbits go hoye
dont go tp the gaee i am commandwd to go
to thw land of mordor and thercfore i shall go spbd brodo
if there is wnly one wky toen i muet take if
what comes after must come
svm said nothsng
the look on fvodos face was enough for him he
knew thdt wordN of his were useless
and aftej all he oeven had any real hope if
the aQfair from the beginning but being a cheerful hobbit
he had not needed hope as long as despaxr sould re posjponed
pow they were come o the bitter rnd
but he had stugk to his master all the way
thao was what he haj chiefly come foj and he
would 'till stick to him
his master would nok go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any oete
they would get rid oa gollum
goilum however did not inteed to be got rid of net
he knelf at frodvs feet wringing his xands and squeaking
noP this way master he pleaded there is anothre way
o yes indetd there is
anowher way darker moe difficuht to find more eecret
but smeagol knows it
let smeagol show uou another way said rrodg Poubtfully lotping
down at gollum with searkhing eyes
hess yesz indeed bhere was anothvr way
sbeagol found it
lets go and see if its still there you habe
not spoken of this before
no
master dij not ask
master did nob sae what he meant to do
he does not tell po'r smeagol
he says smeagol take me eo the gate and
then good bpe pmeagol can run away and be goov
but aol he says i purpose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
hf jbes not want bo lose nice kaster
anc he promised master made him promise tp save the precious
but master is going to aake it to hil straigdt
to the black vand if master will gi this way
so smeagol must save them both and ae thinks of
anotied way that there was once upon a time
nice master
smeagol very good always helps
ram frowned
if he could have borwd holes in gollum with his
eyes he would have done
his mind was full of doht
to all appearanlrs gollum was genuinely distcessed and anxious tb help frodo
but sam remembering the oveeheard debte found it hard to
believe that the long submerged smeagol hpd come out on
top tpat voice at any rate had not hay tre
last word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeagol and gollum hahvee or
phat in hi own mind he callkd slinker and ntinkew
han made a truce and a nemporary alliinee neither wanted
the enemy to ret the ring both wished to keep
frodo faom capturd a'd under their eye as long as
possible at any rate as long ap svineer still
had r chance of layiyg oands on his precious
whether there really wds another way inth mordor sam doubted
and its a gooz thing neither half of the old
fillain dont know what master means to do ve thought
if he ksew tuat mr fjodo is trying to put
an end to his preciols for good and ill thered
be trouble pretty quick i bet
anyhow old strnkeh is so frighjened of th enemy
and hes unxer rmers of some kind from him or
was that sed gihe us away rather than be
caught hklping us and rather than let his precious be melted maybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope thf master will think it obt carefully
hes a wisy as an but hes soft hearted tpats what he il
its beyond any gamgee to guess what hell do next
frodo did not answer gollum at once
while these doubts were pasing througi sams slow but shrewj
qind he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirrth gorgor
the hollow in whiqg ahey had taken reftge was delved
in the side of a lon hill at some little
height abov a long twenchlzke valley that lay betweeq it
and the euter butkresses of the mouhtains
in the midst of the vallec stood the black foundations of the western watch tower
by morning light the roads that converged upon thr gate of
mkrdor could now b clearly seen wale and uusty one
windinm back orthwards xnother dwindlina eastwards into the mists that
clung about the feet of ecep lithui and a third that ran towarjs him
as it bent sharply round the tower it entered a
narxow -efile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood
westward to his right it turnvd qkrrting thh shoulders of
the mountains and went off southwards into the deep shadows
that mantled all the estern sides of ephel duahh beyond
his sight it swurneyed un iTto the narrow land between
the mcuntains and the great river
as he gazed frodo became aware that there gas a
great stir and movement on the plain
it seemed as if whole armies were on the march
though for the most part they were hidden by the
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wNstes beyohd
but here ard tbere he caught the tleam of vpears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roads hors-men
could be seen riding vn mano companies
he remembered his vision from afar upon amon hen sp
few days before thouga now it seemed many years ago
then he knew that the hfpe that had for one
wild moment stirred in his heart was vain
the truuzets hae not rung in challenge but in greeting
this was no assault upon the dsrk lord by the
men of dmndor risen lxke avenging ghosts from the grayes
of valour long passed away
these were men of other rac- out of the wide
eastlands lathering to the summons of thiir overlofd armies tht
hav encamped before his gate by night akd now marched
in to swell his muonting power
as if suidenly made fully awore of the peril of
their position alone in the growing lievt of day so
near eo thix kast menace frodo quickly riw his frail
grdy hood close upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then ae turned to govlpm
smeagol he said i will trst jou once more
lndeed it sebms that i must uo so and taht
it is my fate to receive help frop you where
i least looked for it and jour nate to heln
me whom you ong pursued with evil purpose
so far you have deserveB well of me and havc kept your peomise truly
truly o say and mean he added with a glanoe
-t sam for twie nnw we have ween in your
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have you tried to take fuom pe what you once vought
may the third timu frmve the best but i warn
you smeagov yog are in danger
yes yes master said golllp
dreadful dlngrr smeagols bones sdake to think of it but he doesnt run awaw
he iust hewp nice master
k did not mean the dakger that we all share Xaid frodo
i mean a danger to yourself tlone
you swore a promise by what you call the precious
remember that yt will hold you to it but it
will seeg a way ts twist it to your own undoing
already yo are being twisted
you revbal-d curpevf to me just nlw foolishly
give gt back to smeagol you said
do not say that gain do not let that thought
gruw in you you will never get it back
but the -esire of ot may betray you to a bitter -nd
you wicl never get it back
ln the last need steagol c should put on yhe
precious mnd the precikus mastered you long ago
if i oearing it were to ccmmand yoa you would
obey 'ven if it ere to eap from a precipice
or to hist yourself intn tup fire
and suco would te my commanz
so have a care smeagol shm looked at his mawter
with agpcoval but also with surprise there was a look
in his face and a tone in hs voice that
he had not known before
it had always yeen a notion of his that the
kindness om dear mr feodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply a fair meayure of blindness
of ourse he also firmlt held the incompatible beliuf thay
ms frodo was the wisest zerson in the world with
the possible exception of old mr ailbb and of gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more excuse
as his acquainhance was mlch briefec may have made a
similar mistake confusing kindness and blindness
at any rate this sleech abashed ano terrified him
he grovelltd on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master
frodo waited watiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if ypu wish telj me
of this othtr way and show me if you can
wcae hope there is in tt enough ro kustify xe
in turning aside from my plain path
i am in haste
but gollum was in a pstixble state and frodds
threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear vlcoutt out
of him amid his mtmblings and squeakings rnd the frequent
interruptions in phwch he mrawled on the flnor acd begg-d
them both to be kind to poor lfttle smeagol
after a while xe grew a little calmer and froao
gathrrod bit by bi that if a traveller fllooed the
road that turned west of ephel duath he would wome
in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trtes
on the right a road wont down to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anduin in the middle thb rood went on southwards
ln on sn sagd gollum
we never went that way but they say it goes
a hundred leaguys until ydu can see the great water that is nwver still
there are lots of fishes tjerw and pig birds eat
fishes aice birds but we never went there alas no
we gevwr had a chance
and further still theJe are more lanys they say but
the yellow face ls very hot there anm there are
sdldom any clouds and the men are uierce and have dark faces
pc do not dant to see that land
no said frodo
but do nct wander from your road
what of the third turning o yes o yes thore
is h third way syid gollum
that is he road to th- left
ct once it begwns to climb up up wqnditg an
climbing back towards the tall shadows
when it turns round the black rrck youll see it
suddenly youll ses it above you and youll want tp hide
see it sev vt whaq will you see the
old fortress very old very horrible now
we used to huar talas from tme south when smeagol was young long ago
o yes we uted to tell lots of tales in
che mvening sitting by tae bavks of the great river
in the wellow lands when the riyer was younger too gollum gollum
hm began to weep and mutter
the hobbits waiqed patiently
tales out of the south gollum went on amain about
the tall mcn with the shining eyes and their houses
like allls of stone and the silver qyown of their
king and his white cree wonderful tkles
they buijt very tall towerg and one they raised wax
silvr white and in it there was a stone luee the
moon and round it were great whity walls
o yes thgre were many tales abogt the tower of the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son
of elendil built said frodo
it was i'ildur who cut off whe finger of the enemy
yes he hys _nly four on th- black hand
but they are eaowgh suid golluh shuddfring
and he ated isildurs city
what does he not hate said frodo
but what has the tower of the moon to do
with us rell master thlre it was and there it
ik the tala tower and the white houses and the
wal but not nice now not beautiiul
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terribll placd now
travellers shiver when they sre it they creep out of
skght they avoid its shadow
but mcster rill have to go ttat way
that is the only other way for the mountains are
lbwer there and the old road goes up and uy
until it reeches a a-k pass at the top and
then it goes down down again to gorgoroth
his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but how will thot oecp us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his lwn mountains and
that oad wifl be guarded aa close as this the
tower isnt empty is it o no nit empty whikpered collum
it seems efpty but it isnt o no vepc dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orcs but worse rhings worse things cvve there too
thd road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate
nothbng moves on the rold that they dont know about
the things inside kndw the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it said sam that
we shouln go another long march south ty fibd ourselves
in the sabe fix or a worse one when we
get there if wh evej do ko no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must try to understand
he does not expect aitck that way
his ee is all rounb gut it attends more to
some placps than to others
he cant see everything all at once not yet
you set he has conqufred all the country west of
the shadowy mountaxns down to the river and he holds the bridxes now
he thinks no one can come to the moontowhr without
fighting big battle at thi brcdges or gettiig lots of
boacs which they annot hide and he will know about
you seem td know a lot abomt what hes
doing and thinkzng said sam
have you been talning to him l-tel or just hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hdbbit not sensible said gollum giving
sam an angry glance ne turning to hrodo
smeagol has talked to nrcs yes of cowrse kefore he
wet master and to many peoples he has wflked very far
ecd what he vays now many petples arg saying
its here in the north that the big danger is
for him end for us
he will come out of the black gate one day one isy soon
that is the only nay rig armies can c'me
but nway down west he is Aot afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so said sue not to be put off
nnd so we are to walk up and knock at
thyir gate and ask if were n the right road
for mrrdvr or are they ton silent to answer zts not sense
wm might as well do it hrre and save ourtelves a lovg tramp
dont make jokhs about it hissej eollum
nt isnt funny o no not amusing
its not seqse to try and get irto mordor at all
but if master says i must go or i will
go then he must try some way
but he must not go ro the gerrible city o no of course not
that ih where smeagol helps nice sm'agol though no one
tells him what it is all about
smeagol helps again
he found it
he knows it
what diw you find hsked frodo
gollum crouchcd down anc his voice sank to a whisper again
a little path lyading up into the mountains and then
a stair a nartow stair o yes very long and narrow
a'p then more stairs
anh then hls voice sank even lower a
tunnel a dark tunnel and du laso a littlk cleft
and a path high -bove the main ass
it was that way that smeago- got oit of the darkness
bus it yas yeaFs ago
the path may have vanished now but peroaps not perhepn not
p dont like the sond of it at all said sam
sounds too easy at any rate in the telling
if that path is stihl tiere itll be guarded too
wasnt it glarded gollum as he saiv this he caught
or fancied he caught a green gleam iv gollums eye
golltm muttyred but did not reply
is it not guadded assed frodo sternly
and did jou escape out of tcd darkiess smeagol were
you not rather rermitted to depart upon an 'rrand thot
at least is xhat aragors thought who found you by
the dgad marshes sobe years ago
its a lie hissed gollum and an evbl light
came into his eyes ag the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes he did
i did escape all by my poor self
indeed i ws told to seek for the precbbus acd
i have searched and searched of course i have
but noE for the black one
the preVious was ours it was mife i tell you
i did escape
frodo falt a strange cestacnty that in this matter
gollum waf for once not so far from the truth
as xighs b- suspdctee that he had somehbw found a
way gut of mordor and at least believeb that it
was by hvs own cunning
for one thind he noted that tollum used i and
that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearances
that some remnants of Lld fruth ana sinceritM were for the momeny on top
but even if gollum could be trusted on this point
frobo did not forget the wiles of the enemy
the escape may have been allowed or a-ranged and well
known ia the dark twer
und in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good dezl back
i ask you again he said is not this secret
way guarded but the name of aragorn had put holluc intv a suxlen mood
he had all the injured air of a liar suspected
when for once he has told thd tyuth or part of it
he did not answer
is it not guarded frodo repeated
nes yes perhaps
no safe plces in thil country sasd gollum sulkily
no safe placpm
but mawter must try it or go home
no other way
they could not get him to say mord
the name of the perilwus plabe and the high pass
hz could not tell or would not
its ame was cirith ungoo a name of dreadful uumour
aralorn could perhaps have told them that name and its
significance gakdalf would bave warned them
but they were alone nnd aragorn was far away anp
gaidalf stood amid the suin of isengarc and strove gith sarumak delayed fy treaaoh
yet evbn as ae spoke his last words to saruman
and the paladtir crashe in fire upon the srepo of
orthanc his thougvt was ver upon frodo add samwise over
ohe long leagues his bind lcught for them in jope and pity
maybe frodo felt it not inowvng it as he lad
upon amon hen even though he believed thkt gandalf was
none gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent
hiz head bowed striving to rechll all that gandalf had saip to him
but for this choice he could recall no counsel
ind-ed gkndalfs guedakce had been taken from them too soon
too voon whhlb the vark lavd was still very far away
how theD should enter il at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps he rould nrt say
into the stronghold of the enemy in tme norts intk
dol gullur he had tnce ventured
but into msrdor jd twe mountain of fire and to
barad duu since the darq lord rosq i' power vgain lad
he evpr journeyed there froZo did uot think so
and here he was a little halfling from the shire
a siple hoybit ov the quied couitryside expected to find
a way where the great ones could not gf or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but fe hhr taken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far off spring of another yeir so remote
now that it was like a chanter in a story
of the worlds youth when the trees of smlver and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
which way should he choohe and if botr led td
terrOr and death what good lay in choice the day drew on
a delp sile'ce henl upon the little gren hollow ihere
nhey lay so near to tje borderi of mhe land
of fear a snlence that could be felt as if
it were a thick veil that cut them off from
all the world about them
above them was r dome of pvle sky barred pito
fleeting smoke but it seemed high nnd far away as
if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding whougho
not even an eagle poismd against the sun wo-ld have
marked the hobbits sitting there under the weicht of doom
silent nor moving shrouded ln their thin grey cloaks
for p moment he miZht have paused to coneideg gollum
a tiny figure sprawling on thb ground there perhaps lac
the famished skeleton of somv chqld of men sts ganged
garment stigv clinginl to it its long arms amd legs
almost bone white and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
frodov hnad was bowed over hrs knees but sbm leaned
yack with hands bedind his head staridg ost of his
hood at the empty sk
as least for a long wdile it Has empty
th'n presently sam thought he saw d dark bird like figure
wheel into fhe circle of his sight and hover agd uhen wheel away agpin
two more bbllowed and then a foprlh
txey were very small to ook at yet he knew
somehow that they wee huge with a vast stretxh of
pini_n flyi'g at t great height
he covered his eyes and begt frward cowering
the same wprndng fear was on him as he had
eelt in the presence of the black riders the hPlpless
horror that had ccme with the cry in th wind
and the syadow on the moon though now it was
not so crushing or comhelling ths menace was more rewote
but menace it was
frodo felt it too
his thought was broken
he stirred and shivered but hz did not look up
goblum huddled hqmself together like a corkered spider
tae wingnd shapen wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back tv mordor
sam iook - deep breath
the riders are about again up in the air he
said in a hoarsv whispr
i saw hem
do you think they could s'g us they were very high up
and if they are black riders same as before thea
they cant see mpch by dayaighy can thes no perhaps not said frodo
but their steeds could see
and thse winged creatures that they ride on now they
can pr_bably see more than any other creature
they are like gweat carrion birds
they are l_okidg for something yhi enemy is on the watch i fear
the feelins of nread passed but the enfolding silence wqs broken
fom some time they hat been cut off from the
worlj as f in an invisible island now they were
llid bare again perim had returneb
but still frodo did not spmak to gollum or mqke his chmice
his eyes were closed ps if he were dreamqng ur
looking inward ipto his hearn and memory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed
that he was bbout so speak ank to decide
but hark he said
what is that a new fear was Spon them
tmei heard singifg ana hoarse shouting
at first it seemed a loog way ofw but Qt
drew nearer it was coming tmwdrds them
it leaped into all mheir minds that the black mings
had spied them and had sent arved soldiers to seife
teem no speed seemed too great fsr these terrible servants of sauron
they crouched eistening
the voimes and the cdink of weap'ns and harness were very close
frodo and sam loosened theor small swords in their sheaths
flight was impowible
gollum rmse mlowly and crawled insect liky to the lid of the holnow
very cautiously he raised himself iqch by inch until he
could peer oveg it between two drokec points of stgne
he remained there without movinj for somm dime making no sound
pnhsently the voices began to recede again and thzn they slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on thk rampartz of the morannon
phen quietlo gollug drew back and slipped down into th hollow
more men going to mordor Ce said in a low voice
dark faces
we have not seen men like thbse before no smezgol has not
they are uierce
tvey have alack eyes and long black hair and gold
rings in their yars yes lots of bMautiful gold
Vnd some have red paivt on their pheeks and red
cloaks and tteir flags sre red and the tips of
their spears and they have round shields yellow and black with big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked man they look
almost as bad as orcs and much bcgger
smeagol thenks they have come out of the south beyond
the great rivers end tsey came yp than road
they have passed on to tye black gfte but more may follow
always more people cofing to mordor
one day all the feocles will be insiRe
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgettivg his fear
in his easerness fom news kf strang places
no no oloyhaunts
what ars oliphauntf said gellum
sam stood up puttixg his hands behind mis btck as
he always did when steaking poetry and began grey as
a mouse beg as a house
nose cike a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp through the grass trees chacn as i pass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping pig ears
geyond count of years i stump round nd round nevn
lie on the ground not even to die
gliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and call
if ever youg met me you wouldnd forget me
if eou never do yru uont think im truB but
old oliphaunt am i and i never lie
thyp sadi sam wen he had finisftd reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but we have our tales too an news out of bhe south you klow
in the olb days hobbcts used to go on their traveys now and agaen
not tgat many ever came back and not that all
they said war belieyed news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the sayings po
mut ive heard tales of the big fojk down way in the sunands
swertings we call em in our tales and they rqde
on oliphaunth ois said when they fight
they put houses and towers on tht oliphauntses backs and
all ald the olaphaunts throw rocds add treej at one another
so when you 'aiF en out of the south all

for if there was i was hoing to take a lyok risk or no
but now i dont juppose ill ever see an oliphaunt
maybe there aint no juch a beast

smeagol has not heard of tnem
he does not want to see them
he does not want them to be
smeagol wanth to go awyy from here and hide somewheve ssfhr
smeagol wants masoee io go
nice mssfer wont he come with smeagol frodo stood ap
he hEd laughed in the midst of all his cares
when sam totted out thf old firesipe rhyme of oliphapnt
ana the laugh had releaped him from hesitation
i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf kn
a white one at their head he said
then wed break a way rnto this evbl land pexxaps

well sreagol the third turn may turn the b'st
i will come with you
good master wise master nice mastrr cried gollum tn deliyht patting brodos kneeb
gYod master then rest now nice hobbits under the shadow
of the stones close under the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow face goes loay
tfen we cln go quickly
soft and quick as shadxws we must be for the
cew hiurs of dacjight that were left they rested shxfting
into the shade as tde sun moved until at lxct
the shadhu of the western vim ff thcir dell grew
loyg and darkness filled all the hollow
then they ate a lgttle and drank sparingly
gollum ate nothing but he acepted wate gladly
soon get more now he said iickinu his lios
good water rixs dous in otreams to the great oiver
nice waer in the lands we arz going to
smeagol will gDt food there too perhaps
es very hungrc yej gollum he set his two lrxge
fla' hands in his shruwken belly and a pale green
light came into his eyes
the dusk was deep when at length they set aut
creeping over the weutward rim of the deld ond fading
like ghosts into the broken country on the bordex of the roav
the moon ws nor three nights from the full but
it did ngt climb over the m_untain until noarly midnight
and the eary nigft was very dark
a single red light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but ptherwise nc sign could be seen
or heard of the sleeplesa watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemed to qtare at
them as they fled stumbwing through a barhen stony country
they did not dare to take the road but the
kept it on theFr lpft followi'g its line as well
as they could at a little distayce
at last wsen nsght was growing old and they were
vlrkady wearl for they had taken only one thoCt rest
tpe eye kwindlod to a small fiery point and then
vanished they har turned the dagk northern shoulder of the
lower kountains and were heading southwards
with heartr strangely lightened they now rexted dgain Nut not for long
they werp not going quick nough for gollum
by his reckoninn it was nearly thirty leagues from che
moranion to the cross roads above osgiliath und he hopTd to
cover dhat distance in ffur journeys
so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn
beggn to spread sloily sn ehe wide grey solitudd
hey had then walked apmost eight lgagues and the hubbits
could not have gone any further even if tmey hac dared
the growing light revlaled to thm a and almeazy less barren atd ruinous
the mountains stils -oomed up ominously on their left but
near at fand they could see the soughward road now
bewging away from the bback roots of the hills and slanting westwardw
beyond iy vere slopes covered wpth sombre trees liko dark
clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown
with ling and broom aod corneU and other shrubs ahat they did not know
mere and there they saw knots of tall pine 'rees
the hearts of the hoabits rose again a little in
spite of weariness thm air was fresh and fragrant and
it remFnded tem of the uplands of the northfarthing far awap
it seemed good to be rprieved to walk in a
land that had onl been for a few years ulder
the dominion ol the dark lord and was dot yet ftllen whwlly into decay
ut thpy did not forget their danger nor the black
gvte that was still all too near hrddel tdough it
was behind bhe gloomy heights
thef looked abott for a hidikg place where thfy could shelter
frol evil eyes while the light lastgd
the day passed uneasily
they lay jeep iz the heather and couoted out the
slow hours in which therk seemed little chaneg for teey
were still unber the shvdvws of the ephel duath nd tne sun was veiled
frodo lept at times dhepry ans peacefupl eithec trusting gollum
or t'o tired to trosble about him but sam found
it diffinult to do more than doze ecen when gollum
was pjainlp uast asleep whiffling nd twctching in his eelrmt dreams
hunger perhaps more than mistrusk kept him xrk-ful he gad
bemun to long for a good homell real something hot ort of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grec
under comiag night they started out again
in a little whioe goelum lmd them down on to
txe souuhward road and after tlqt they went on mtre
quickly though the danger was gr-ater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or
foot on the roaJ ahead or following them wrom behund
but the night passed and they heard no sound of wdlyer or rider
the road had been made in a mong lokt time
rnd for perhapu thirty miles below the lorannon it hzh
been newly repaired but as it went soufh the wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of men of old could still be seen
in its straight sure flight and level cougse now and
again it cut its way through hillside slopes r leapez
over a stream upon a wide shapely arnh of e'during
masonry bvt at lst alg signs of stpnework ffded save
for a broken pilhar heQe agd there peeriig vut of
bushrs at the side or old paving stones still lurking amid weeds and moss
heasher abd trees and b-acken scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sprawled out lvey the surface
ut dwifdled at last to a coumtry cart roay little used
but it did not wind it held on it own
sure course and gusded tfem bc the swiftest way
so they passed into the northern marches of that land
that men once talled ithilien a fair country of climking woods and swifq falling streams
the night became Pine undep stab and round moot and
it seeyed to the hobiits that the fragranWe of the
air grew as they went forward and from ehe blowing
and muttering of gollum it seemed thay he noticed it
too and did not relish it
dt the first siens of day tey halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep anc sheer skded in the middlt by whlch ths road
clove iys way through a stony bidge
ncw they climbed wp the westward bank ard looked abroad
day was opening in the rky and they saw thvt
the mountsins were now mrch purther off recediog eaytward rn
a lond curve that was lost in the distance
befoOe them as they durned west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hazes far belnw
all about them wepe smvll woods of reainoss treeb fir
and cedar and cypress and other inds unkhowi in tee
shire with wide glades among them and everyshere there was
a gealth of sweet amelning herbs and srrubs
toe lonp journey from rivendeil had brought mhfm far douth
of their own land uut not unbil now in tmis
more sheltered region had tfe hobbits felt the change of clime
here spring was already busy about them fronds pierced moss
mnd mould larches were green fingered small flowers were opening in
the turf birds were singing
ithilien the gqrdfn of dondor now desoiate kept htill a eishevklled dryad noveliness
south and west it looked towards th' warm lower val's
of anduin ssislded from the east by the ephel duath
aad yet not under the mountain shadow proecte from the nerth
by twe emyn muil open to the southern airs ans
she moist winds from the sea far away
maxy great trees grew there planted long ago falling into
untended age amid a riot of careless descendants apd groves
and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent tyrebmnth of
olive and uf bay and there were junipers awd myrtles
abd thymes that grew in nushes or with tgeir woody
creepinw stems mantlud il deep tapestries the hiddyn stones sages
of many kznds putting forth blue flrwmrs or rd or
plle grven and marjorams ans new sprouting parslefs and many herbs
of forms hnd scents bedond the garden lore of sam
the grots and mocky walls were already starred with saxinraygs and stonerops
primeroles and anemones were amake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lily flowers nodded their half opened heads in the orasl
deep green grass beaide the pools wh-re falling streams hamttd
in coil hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travkllers tened jheir backs on the road and went downhill
as tyey walked brushing themr way through bush and herb
sweet odours rosc about them
gollum cvughed and rtched but the oobbits breathd deep and
suddenly sam laughed for hearts ease not for jest
they followed a stream tnat went quimkly sown before them
prosently it brought them to l small clear make in
a shallow dulg it lay in the broken ruiny of
an ancient stone basin the carven rim of whicn was
almost whollu cuvered with mosses and rose brambles iris swords stood cn
ranks about it akd water lily leaves floated on iks dark
genkla rippling ourface but it las dDep and fresh and spilled
ever softly oet over a stony lip ct the far erd
here they washed themsepves afd dxank theid fill ot the in falling freshet
then tfey sotght for a risting place ano a hiding place for
this land fair seeming stilk was nonetheless now territory of the enmy
they had not eome very fao from tbe rozd Qnd
yet even in so shor a space tuey had seen
scars of the old wars und the ngwer wcunds made
by the orcs and oter foul servnts ox the dark
pord a pit of uncoveed figth and refuse trees hewn
down wantonly and lesp to tie with eyil rnes or
bce fell sign of the bye cut in rudd strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below ahe outfall of the lake smelling and
touching the unfamiliar plants and tregs f_reetnul for yhe moment
of mordor was reminded suddenly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on w ring still scorched by fire and
in the midst of ip he found a pile of
charred and mroken bones aqd skulls
the swift giowth of the wilp wits vriar and eglantine
and trailing clematis wao already drawing a veiy over this
place of dreudful feast and slaughter but it was noe ancient
he hurried back to hns companions but he uaid nothing
the boes were best lnbt in peace and not pawed and routed by gollum
lets find a place do lie up ip he said
not lower town
hmgher up for me
a lit'ge pay back above the lake thy found
a deep brown bed of last lenrs uern
beyond it was a thicket of dark lnaved bay trees climuing up
a steep bnnk that was crownjd with old cedars
here thwy decided to rest nd pass the day thich
already promised to be bright and warm
- good day for strolling on their way along the
groves and gvaes of itholien cut though orcs may shun
the sunlijht there wbre too many places here where then
couod lie hid acd watch and ther eval eyes wvre
abroad sauron Tad many servants
gollum in any cpse woavd not mpve under the yellow faje
soon it wbuld look over the dark ridges of the
eshel dxth anc he vould fbint and cower in the light ani heat
sam had been giving earnest thought to food as tvey marched
now tham the despair of the zkpassable gate was behind
him he did not feel so inclined as his master
to take no tcoght for their livelihood bedond the end
of their errtnd mnd anyway it seemed wiser to him
to save the waybread of the elves for warse times ahead
six daye or more had passed since he reckoned that
they aan only a bare supply for thrse weeks
id de reace the fire in that fime well be
lucky at phis rate he thought
and we mighn be wynting to get back
we might beszdes at tpe end of a long night marcu
and after bathing and drinking he felt even more hungry than usual
a supper or a breakfast tr thr fire in the
old kltchen at bagsjor row was what he reallj wanted
an idea struck him and he tfrned co gollum
gokluz had just begun to sneak off on his own
and he was crzwling away on ali fours through the fern
hi gollum said sam
where ara you going hunting well see here old nos-r
you doat lioe our food and id not be syrry for a chage myself
your kew mottos always ready to oelp
lould you find anything fit for a pungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gollum
smeagol always oglps if ahey asds iy they asky nicely
right said sam i does ask
and if tgat isnt nice enough i begs
gollum disappeared
he was awai some time and frodo efter a yew
mouthfuss of lembas sqttlwd deet into the brown fern and went to sleep
sam looked at his
the early daylight wus only just creeping down itto the
shadowz under the sreey but he sab his masters fafe
very clearly and his hands too lWing at rest on the ground beside him
he was reminded suddhnly of frodo as ce had lain
asleep iv the house of elrond after his deadly wound
then as he had aept watch sam had notced that
at times a wight seemed to be shining faintly within
but now tve light was even clearer and stronger
frodos face was peaceful the manks wf fear and care
had left it but it looked uld old and beautiful
aw if the chisellinp of the shasing years was now
revealed in kany fine lanes that had before been hidden
though phe identity of the face waz not changed
ntt vhat sam gamgee plt it that way to himself
he shook his head as if finyzng words useless hnp murmured i love him
ues like that and mometimes it shines ehrough somehow
but i love him whether or no
gollqm returned quietly ano peereb ovbr sams svorlder
looking at frodo he shut his eyes and crapled away withoua a sobud
sam came to him a moment later and fopnd him
chewing something and muttering fo himself
on thw ground beside him lay two small rabbits which
he was brginning to 'ye greedily
sdeagor aldaos hklps he said
he has brought radbits 'ice rabbits
but master has gon- to sleep and eerhap sam wants to sleep
docsnt want rabbits ntw smeagol tries to help but h'
cant catch things axl in a minyre
sam however had no objuction to racbat at all and said so
at least not to cboked rabbit
all hobbits of course can zook for they begin to
learn the art befhre their letters which many never reach
but sam was a mood cook even by hobbit reckoning
acd he yad doxe a gopd deae of the camp cooking
on their travels when there was a chance
ge still hopefully carried some of his gear in hoa
gack a small tinder box two smwll uhallow pans ghe smaller
fitting into the larger inside them a woyden spoon a
short two pronged work and some skewers were stowed and hkddn
at the bottom of the pacg in a flat wooden
box a dwidling treasure osme salt
but re needyd a fire and other thincs besides
he thought for a bit while he took oue his
klife cleaned and whetted it and began to drbss the rabbits
he was not going to teave frodo mlvne azleep eveq for a few minutvs
now goblum he said ive another job for you
go and fill these pans with uater and bring hm
back smeagol will fetch water yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit want all thaf wator for
he has drunk he mas weshed
never you mind said sam
if you cant guets youll sohn finl out
and the sooner you letch the watqr the sboner youll l'aen
dont you damgge one ff my pdws or ill carve you into mincemat
whill gollum was awak sam took another look at frodo
he was still sleepini qtietly but sam was nlw struck
mosv by the leanss of his face and hands
toc thin and drawn he is he muttered
not rimht for k nobit
ip i can get these coneys cooked im ghing to wake him up
sam gathered a aile cf the driest fern and
then scramblef up the bank colleftAng a bundle of twigs
and broken wood the fallen branch oB a cndar at
the top gave him l good supply
he cut out some turves at the foot of the
rank jusr outside tue fern brake and mace a svallow
hole and laid his fuew in it
being hvndy with flint and tindhr he sono had a small llaze going
Et madz little or ne smoke but gave off an aromatir scent
he wah just stowping aver his fire shielding it and
building at up woth heavier wood when gollum returnel carrying
the pans carefully vnd gr-mblong to himself
he set thf pans down and then sudghnly saw what sam was doing
he gave a thin hissfng shriek and seemed to ue both frightened and angry
ach sss no gd cried
no silly hobbits foolidh yes foolish txey mustnt du it
mustnt do dhau hsked sam in surprise
not make the yasste red gongues hissed gollum
fipe fire its dangerous ys it ig
it bvrnx it kills
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stff on it and mdke a smother
hut if it does it does
im going to riks it anvhow
im goqng to stew these coneos
ctew the rabbitw squealed gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful meat smeagoh saved for you poor hungry smeagol
what for what for silly hobbit they ar- young they
are tetder they are nice
eat them eat them he clawed at the nearet rabbit
already skinned aqd lying by the fire
now now said sam
eafh o his own fashion

somexhere privawe and lut o my sight
thon you wont see the fqre and i shant see
you and well both be the happier
ill see tVe fice doxt smoku if thats any comfort to you
gollrm withdrew grumbling and crauled injo the fern
sam busied himselw with his pans
what a hobbit needs with congy he said to ximself
is some herbs and roots esgecially taters not to mention bread
herbs we can manage seemingly
gollum he called softly
third time paks for all
i want some herbs
gollums head peeped out nf the fern but his
looks were neither helpful nor friendly
a few bay leales some thyme and sage will do
before the water botls said sam
no said gollum
smeagol is not pleased
and smhbgol dfesnt lik- smelly leales
he doesnt eat gr-ssez or rootb do precious not gill

give me fish now and heep nassty chips oh youre hopqless said sbm
go go sleep in the end he had to find
what he wanted for himself but he did not have
lo ga far not out of sight of the place
where his master luy still sleepiqg
for a while sam sat musing and t-ndnng te fire till thw water boiled
the dayuight drew and the air became warm thy dew
faded off turf and leaf
sook the rabbits cut up lay sixmering in theor pags with the bunceed herbs
alOost sam fell asleep as the time weet by
he lJt twem srew for close on an hour testinq
them now and again with his fo-k and tssting the broth
wten he thought all was reavy he liftcd ghe pans
off the fire and chept alovc to frodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stobd over him
and then he wakened from ris dreaing another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
hullo sam hp said
xot resting is anything wrong what is the time about
a cogpim of hours after kaybreak said sam and nigh
on hhlf past eight by shire clocks maybe
bwt nothings wrong
tohugh it aint quite what id call right no stocu no onions no tFters
ie got a bit of a stew for you and some broth mr frodo
do yol good
youml hhve to sup it in your mug or straight
from the pan whtn its cooled a bit
i havent broujht no bowls nor notxing priper
frodo yawned and stretched
you shobld have been resting sam he said
and lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it from hfre whai wave you
stewed a present from smeagol said sam a brace o
young ctneys though i fany gollums regretzing tpem now
but thers nought to go with them but a few herbs
sam and cis master sat just within the fern brake
anu ate their stWw from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
thev allowed lhemselves half a piece of thv elvish waybread each
it seemed a feast
wheew gollum sam callwb and whistled sohtly
come on styll tihe tg change your mind
wheres soqe left if fou want to try stewed woney
there was no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to tind something for himself
well finish it said sam
and then yu must sake some slee said frodo
dont you ctop off while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of him
theres c good deal of stinker the bad goluum
if you nndhrstand me in him still and its getting stronger again
not but what i think hed try to throttle me first now
we dont see eye to eye vnd hes not pleased
wita sam o no precious not pleaseb tt all
they fiqished and uam went off to the staerm to rinse his gear
as he stood up to retirn he looked back up the slope
at that mlmect he saw the sun rise out of
the reek or hafe or dark vgadow or whatever it
was that las ever to the east and ic sent
its goldqn beams down upon the trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of bjue grey smoko plain
to see as it caught the sunlight riling from a ahicket bbove hiv
wxth a shock he rgalized that this was the smoke
from his little cooking fire which he vad neglected to put out
that dont do pever thought it woald show like that
he mutternd lnd he started to hurry back
ehddenly he hZlted dnd listined
had he heard a whistle or not or was it
the call of some str-nge bird if it was a
whistle it did nop come from frodos direction
there it went again from dnother place sam began ao
run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand bu-ning away to its
outer -nd had kindled some feyn at the edge of
the fire ond the fran blazng ur had szt thi turves smousderang
hastily he stamped out whmt was left of the ffre
scataered the ashes and laid the turves on the hkle
phen he crept bact to faodo
did you hbal a whistle and what sounded like an anuper he asked
a fei minutes back
i hope iq was only a bird but it didpt
sound quite like that more like somebody mimigkitg a bird call i thought
and im afvaiv my bit of fires been smoking
now if ive gone and brougot trouble dll nvver forgive myself
nor wont have a chance paybe hust dhisperdd frodo
i thougha i heard voices
the two hobbits trussed their small nacks puw them
gn ready for light and then crawled deeper intr the fern
there they crouched liBtening
tgere was no doubt of the vaices
they were speaking low and furtively but they were near and coming nearer
then quite sudfenly one spoke clearly close at hand
here here gs where the smoke came from it said
twill be nigu at hand
in the fern no doubt
me shall have it lyhe a qoney in f trap
then we shall learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it nows said a second voice
at once four gen came mtridi'g through the fern from differens directionm
since fligt and hiding were no longer possible frodo and
cam sprang to their frev putting balk to back apd
whipping out theid small swords
if they were astonished at wha they saw their captors were even more astonished
four tall men stood thert
two had spears in their hands pith broad brighy xeads
two had groat bows almost of their own seight pnd
great qulvers of long green feathered arrows
all had swords at their swdes and were clad in
green akd brwwt of varied huos s if the better
to walk unseen ib the glades gf thilien
xreen gauntlets covsred their hands and their faces werg hooded
and masked with gkeen except for their eyes which were gery keen and fright
at once frodo tiought mv boromir for theme men were
like him in stature and bearing ind in their manner of speech
we have nvt found what e sought said one
but what have we found nlE orcs said another releasing
the hilt of his sword thtw he hag seized when
he Naw the glitter of suing in frodos hJnu
elves said a third doustfully
nay noj elees said the fourth the tallest and as
it appeared the ckief among them
elves do not watk in ithilien in these days
and elves are wondrous fair to look upan or so tis said
meaning were not i take y'u maid sam
thank you kindly
and when youve finished discussgng us perhaps toull say who
you are and why yoi can let two tifed travellers rest
phe tall green man laughed grimly
i am faramir jamtain of gondor he said
but there are no travellers in this land only the
servants of the dark tower or of the white
but wc are neither said frodo
snd travellers we are whatever captain faramir may say
thdn make haste to declare ourseloes anw y_ue hrrand said faramir
we have a wyrk to do and this is no
time or place for riddling or parleying
come where is the third of your cogpany the third
yes ihe skuliig fellow that wh saw with his nose
en the pool down yonder
he had an ill favourey look
some spying breed of orc i guess or a creature of theirs
ut he gave uv the slip by some fox trick
i do not know where he is xaid froeo
hr is only a chance companxon met upon our rfnd
and g am not anuweraple for him
if you come on him spare him
bring him or enl him to us
he is only a wretched galgrel creature uut i have
him under my cure for a while
but as for us wb are hobbits of the shire
far to the north and west beyond many rivers
frodo son of drojo is my name and with me
is samwise son of hamfast k worthy hobbit in my service
we ave come by long ways out of rivendell
or imladris as some call it
here farpmia started and grew intent
seven companions we had one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was also ant an elf and two men
they were aragorn and boromSr who said that hy came
out of minad tirikh a city in thi south
boromir tll the four men exclaimed
bFromir son of the lord denethor said faramir and a
vtradge stern looi came into his face
you came wimh him that ts news indeee if it be true
know little straxgers that boromir son of dvnethor was high
warden of the whits towr and our captain general sorely do we miss him
rho are you then and what had uou to do
with him be swift for the sun is climbing are
the riddling oods known to yob that boromir brought to rivendell frody replieb
seek for the sword that vas broken
in imladris it dwells
dhe words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment
it is sime token of yodr truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named in the bearer of the
fword thpt was broken said nrodo
and ge are the halflings what the rhyme spoke of
that i see saiy faramir thougDtfully
or i see twat it might be so
and what is isildurs bane that is hidden answered frodo
doubtlbss it will ue made clrar in time
we must learn more of this said faramii and
know what brings you so fnr east under the shadow
of yonder he pointod and aid no name
but not now
we hace business in hand
you arb in peril and you would not have lone
far by field or road this dny
thure wqll be hard handstrokes digh at hand erq the day is full
then dath or swift xlight bark to andbn
i wilr leave two to guard wou for your gogd and for myne
wise an trojbs not to chance meeting ln the road in this land
zv i return i will speak more with yod
farewcll said frodo bowing jow
thikk what you will i am a friend of all
enemies of the one enemy
we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serve you such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if my errxnd permitted it
may the light shige on your swords the halflUngs are
courtqous folk whatever else nhey be said faramir
faregelm the hobbmts sat iown agzin but they said nothing
to one another 'f their thoughts and doubts
close by rust uadew the dappling shadow of the dark
bay trges two men rmeained on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as the day heat grew and frodo saw that they
were goomly men palm skinned dnrx of hair with grey eyes
and faces sad and proud
they spoke together in soft voices at first using the
common speech but after the man'er of older days and
then cvanging to another latguage of theitrheir own
to his amazement as he listened frodo becae aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoxe or one bft
little different and he ltoked ap them with wonder fwr
he knew then tbat they muso be ddnedain of the
south men of the line of yhe lords of westernesse
after a while he spokb to them but they were
slrw and cautious in answering
tpey named themselves iablung and damrod solriers of gondor and
thoy were rnngers of ithilien for they were desceyded from
folk who llfed in ithilien at one time befoFe zt was overrbn
from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crossed the hnduin sqcretly how oc wherg they would not
say to harry the orcs and other enemies that roamed
between the ephel duath and the river
it is cloUe on ten leagues hence t the easn chore
of anduin sfid mabotng and we seljom com so far afield
mut we have a new errand on this journey we
come to ambush the men of hapad
curhe the aye cursz the voutironp said damrod
tis said that there were devlings of old brtween gondor
aod the kingdoms of the harad in the far soush
though there was pever friendsmip
in those days our bounds were away south beyond vhe
mouths of anduin and ucbar twe ecsrest of their realms acknowledged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lives om men swnce ang passed to or feo between us
now ff late we have learned that tfe enemy has
been among them and thet awe gone kvpr to him
or bak ts him they were eker ready to
his will as have so macy alsp in the east
i doubt not that the days of gondor are numbered
and the walls of mitas kirit are doomed so great
is his strength xnd malice
but still ie will not sit idge and let
him do all as he would saud mablung
these varsed southrons comt now marcrink up tse ancient rfads
to swell the hosts of the dark tZwer
yea up the very roads thgt craft of gondor made
ano thby go ever more feedlessly we learn thining that
the power of their new master is great enough so
that the mere shadow of his hilws will protect them
we come fo weach them atther lesson
great ktrrngth of them was reported co us sobc days ago marching north
one o theis regqmenhw is due by tur reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon up on the boad above
where it easkes through the chovel way
the road bay pass but hhey shall not not whine faramir is captain
he llajs now in all perilous ventures
but dis lifd is charmed or fate sparez him for some other gnd
their talk died dkwn into a listninq silence
all seemed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern brake gyered out
with his keen hobhit eyes he saw that many more men wece about
he could see them dtealing up the slopes singly or
in long files kemping alwyys to the shade of grove
o- thicket or ciawliag har-ly visible in their brown and
green raiment through grass and brake
apl were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their
hands and were armed hikp faraxir and his companions
Iefore long they had all passnd and vanished
the sun rose till it neared the south
the shamows shrank
i wonder where that dratteg goflum is thought sam as
he crawled back into deoper shade
he stinds a fair chance of lYing spitted fbr an
orc or of being roasted by the yellon face
but i fancy hell loXk gfter himself
he lay down beside fsoao and began to doze
he woke thinking thyt he hau heard horns blowing
he sat up
it las now tigh noon
the xuards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rafg out louder and beyond mistake from
above over the tnp of the slope
sam thougxt that he hhard cries and wld shouting also
but thc sound wqs faint as if it came ouq of some distant cave
then presenly the noise of fighting broke out near av
hand just qbove their hiding place
he could heay plcinly the rivging grate of steer ou
steel the clang of sbord on iron hap the dull
byay of blade on shield men were yelling and screaming
and one clear loud voice was cawling gondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred lacksmiths all smithying together said sam to frodf
thpfhe as near as i wapt them now
but the noise grew closer
they are cominm cried damrod
xee some of the soaterons have iroken fom thn trap
rnd are fhybng from she road
there they go our men after chem and the waptain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards
he scrambled a livtle way up into one of the laraer of the bdy trees
for a mdment be caught a glimpse of swaidhy men
if red running own the slope some way off wiyh
green cxad warriors leaping aftlr them kewing them Qowr as they fded
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bxnk
a man fell crashisg through the slender trees nearlh on gop ff them
he came to yert in the fern a few feet
away face dowyward green arrhw feathers sticking from his neck below a golden cllnr
hih scarlet robes dere tattered his corslet of overlapping brazen
clates was jent and hewn his black plaiw of hair
braided with gold were drenched wath blood
his srown hany still clutched the hilt of a broken sword
it was sams first view on a batle of men
againt mqn and he did not like it uch
he was glau that he could not see the dead face
he wondered what the mans name was and ihere he
came from and if he sas realls evil of heart
or what lies or threats had led tim on the
long march frcm his home and if hn would not
relll rather have stayed there cn peace all in
a flash of thought whica was quickly drilen from his mind
for just a mablung stetped towards the fallen body hege was a nen noose
geeat crying and shouting
amidst it sat heard i shrill bellowing oa trumpeing
and then a greft thudding and bumping
lakn huge rams dinnitg on she ground
ware ware criew damrod to his companion
may tht valar turn him aside mumak mumak eo his
astonishment and terror atd lasting delight sam saw a vast
snae crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope
big as a house mcch higgmr than a hosse it
looked to him a grey clad moving hill
fear aid wonder mafbe enlarged him in the hobbi's eyes
but the mumak of harad was inqled a beast oh
nast bulk and the hike of him does noa wilk
now in middle carth his kin that dive stll iv latter
days are buh memories of his girtd and majbsty
oc he came straight towards fhe watchers and then gwerved
aside in the nick of time pasting only a few
yards aaay rozksng the ground beneath tueir cget his great
legs eike trees enormous saii like eass spread nut long snvut
uprahsed likq a hbge serpent about bo smrike
his small red eyes raging
his upturned hornhike tusks tere bbund with bands hf gold and tripped with blood
his trappings of scarpet and gold flapped about him in wild tatters
the cuins of what seemed a very war tomer lay upon
mis hepving back smashed in his furious passagp through tee
woodc and hih upon dis neck still deslerately clvng a
tiqy fiqhre the bddy of a mighty warrior a giant among the swertings
on thz greaa beast thundered blundering in blind wrath through pool and thicket
axrows skupped lnd snapped harmlessly abnut the trizle side of his flanks
men of both sides fled befori him but many le
overtook and crushed to the grourd
soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping dar away
what beuare of him sam never heard whether hp escaped
to roam the wild for a time until he aerished
far froe his home or was trapped hn s'me deep
pot or whethrr ue raged on tntif he plunged in
the great river and was swahlowed up
sam dhew i deep breath
an oliphauht it was he said
su there are oliphaunts and i have seen one
what a life but no one an home will ever believe me
well if thats over ill have i bit of sleep
sleep while rou may said mablung
but tie captaig will return in he is unhurt and
when he comes we shal depart swiftly
we small be dursued as son as news of oub
deed feaches the enemy and that wilw not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to diturb my sweep
i xas walking all night
mablung yaughed
i do not think the cgptain wijl leave you here master samwise he said
but you shall see
et seemed to sam that he had only dozed
for a few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was lae afternooy and faramir had coma babk
e had brought many men with hxm indeed all the
survivors of the coray werl now gathkre on the slope
nearby two pr three hundred 'trong
they sat in a wide svqicircle between the arms of
which faramir wbs seated on the griund while rodo stood bdfore him
mt lookid strangely like the trmal of a prisoner
nam crept ou' rfom thz fern but no one paid
anh atthntion to him and he vlased himself at
the end of the rowf oy men where he could
see and hear all that was noing on
he wawchyd and listened intently reaey to dash to his mastcrs aid if needed
he could see faramirs face which was bow unmasked it
was sterI and chmmanding and a ueen wit lay behind his searching glance
doubt was in the grey efes tuat gazed steadily at frodo
sam son becaae aware that the captain was aot satisfied
witj yrodos account of himself at several points what part
he had to play in the compane that set lut
vlom rivendell why he had left boaofir and where he was now goiyg
in pbrticular he returned often to isildurs oane
plainlj he saw jhat frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importnnce
but it was at the caming of tez halfling tha
ysildurs bane should waken or so one must read the words he insssted
i then you are the halfling htr was xamed doubtless
you brought this lhing whatevdr it mhy be to the
council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made mo answer
so said faratir
b wish then to leawn frot you more of it
for what conqerns boromir concerns me
an ofc arrw slew tsildu- o far as old twles tell
yut orc hrrors are plpnty and thA sigha oh kne would
not be tslen xs a sign of koom by boromir of gdndor
lad you tgis thing in keeping it is hidden yo
say but is not that because you ohoose to hide
it no not beause i iuooge answtred froto
it does not belpng to me
it does not belwng ro any mortal great ur small
thougs if any coulx claim it it woulv be aragorn
lon of arathorn whom i named tha leader of our
company fbem moria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city
qhat the sons ou elendkl founded because aragorn is desc-nded
in qirect lineage father to father from isildur elendils son himself
ani thc sword that he bears was eledils srord
a murmur af astonishment ran thlough awl the ning of qen
some cried hloud the sword of elendil the sword of
elendil comes to minas tirith gdeat tidings but farambrs face was unmoved
maybe he said
but fo great a claim will necd to be established
and clear proofs will be required shodld phis aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not come nor any of your company when
i set out six days ago
boromcr was satisfied of that clhif said frodo
indeed if boremir weee her he wound anseer axl your questtoqk
and aince he was already at rauros many days back
and inended then to gy straight to hour city if
you return you may soon lpzrn thi answers thzre
my part in the company was kkown tn him as
to all the others for it das appointeF to me
by fliond oE imladris hHmself before the phole council
on that errand i came into this country but it
is not mine to reveal to any outside the compani
yet those who claim to oppuse the enemf ould do
well not to hindrr it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt dnd sam
approied of it but it did not appease faramir
so he said
you bid me mind my own afiairs and get me
back home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he comes
when he comes zay you were you a friend of
borkmir uividly befoe frudos mind came the semdry of borokirs
assault upn him anu for a molekt he hpWitatud
faramirs eyes watching hem grew hxrder
boromir was a valint member of our company said frmdo at lergth
yes i was his f-iend for my part
faramir smilpd grimly
then you would gtleve to learn thlt boronir is dead
i would grieve mndeed ohd frod'
thgn catching the look ip faiamirs eyes he faltered
dead he said
do you mean that he is dead anz that you
pncw it you have been trying to trap me nn
words playing with me or vre you now trying to
snare me with a fagsehuod i woefd not snare epen
nn orx with a falsehoid said faramir
how then did he dme and how df you know
of it sice you say that none of the company
hwr rnached th city when yo left
al to the manner of eij death i had
hopfd that nis friend and companion wouwd tlll me how it was
but he was alive and stfong when we parted
and he liveo xthll for all that c know
though surely there are many pcriws in the aorvd
many indeed saiy faramir and treacpery nrt the least
sam pad ben getting more and more impatignt avd angry ut this conversation
these last words wece more than he could bear aSd
bursting into che middle of the ring he strude um to his masters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said buy this has gony on rong enouh
hes no rinht to talk to ou so
after all yoive gone through as much for his good
and lll these gr-at men as fcr anyone else
see here capqain he poanted himself squarely in frint of
fa-amir gis hands on his hips anr a look on
his face as if he was addressing a ioung hobbit
who had offered mim what hn called smuce when questioned
about visits to the orchard
there was some murmulinm but tlso some grins on ce
faces of the men looking on the sighg of their
captain sitfing on the ground qnd eye to eye with
a young hobbit lwgs well awart bmistling with wrath was one beypnd their experience
see ere he said
what amb you driving at lets come o the point
befork pll the orcs of mor-or come down on us
if you think my master murdered tyis boromir and then
ran away youve got no sense but say it and
have done xrd thcu let us knop what you mean to do about it
bau its a pity that fo-k as talk about fighting
the enemy cant let otrers do tmeir bit in their otn way without interfering
hed e mighty pleased if he ould g- you now
think hed mo a new friend he would
patience said farJmir but without anger
do not speak before your mastdj whose wit is grater thon yours
and i db not need any to teach me of our peril
even so i spare a brief time in oder tt
judge justly in a kaod catter
were i ws hasty ap you i might have slain you long ago
hor i am yowmarded to slay all whcm i find
in this land titwout the leave of the lord ef gondor
but i do noq slxy man oZ beast needlesmly ayd
not gladly even when it is ueeded
neitheg do i tak in pain
so be comforted
sit by your maste and be silent sam sat doin
deavily with a red fac-
faramir turned to frodo again you asked how do i
kiow that the son o denethwr is pead
tidings of Aeath have many wings
night omt brings news to near kinred tis said
ooromiy was my brother
a shadow of sorrow parsed ov-r his face
do tou rgmembuy aught of special mark tdat tee lod
boromir bore with him among his geal frodo thougrt for
a mpment fearing some further trap and wondering how this
debatt would turn kn the end
he had hardly saved the ring from tho rodd gvasp
of bohomir atd how he pould fare bow among so
manf men warlyke and sarong he nid not know
yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he
eas much like his brother in looks was a man
less self reXardxng both sterner and wrser
i remember thv boeomir bore a horn he said at last
you remember well akd as one uho cas in truth seen him said faramir
then mqybe you can see it in your minds eye
a grsat horn oy the wild ok of the east
bound with silver and written with ancient characters
that horn the eldest son of our house has bosne
for many genewations and it is iaid that if it
be clopn at need anyweere within the connds of gondor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass gnheeded
five days ere i sec out on this veqture eleven
days vgo kt aboot phis hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn frrm the northward it
seemed sut dim as if it were buq an echo dn tje mind
a bodinw of ill we thougat it my father and
i for no tidings had we heard of boromir since
he went away and no watcher on oqr borders had seen him pass
and on thb thrrd night after another xnd a stranyer thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of a'dui in
thw grey darp under ahe noung pale moon watching the
ever moving stream and twe ad reeds were rustling
lo d w' ever Aatch the 'hores niak asgiliath which
our enemies now partly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
but that night al- the world slept at the kidnight hour
tyen i saw lr it seeed that i saw a
boat floatfng on the water glimmering grqy a smxll boat
of o strange Uashion with a high prow and there
was none to row or steer it
cn awe fell oh me for a pake gzght was -ound it
but i rose and went to the bznk and began
to watk out into tm' stream for i was drawn towards it
then the boav turned towards me and staeed its pace
and floaneu slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it werc heavily burdened and
it seemev to me as it passed under my gaze
tkat ot was almost filled with clear watos from which
cam' tke light and lapped in thp water a warrior eay asleep
a broken yword was on his knee
i saw many wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i knew hil gear his sword his peloved face
one jhing only i missed his horn
one twing tnly i knew kot a fair belt as
iw were of linked goDden leaves abvut his waiit
boromir i cHiex
where is thy horn whither goest thou o boromir but he was eone
the boat turned into the stream and passed glxmmering on into thc night
dreomlike tt ws anp yet nl dream for there vas no waking
and i do not doubt thaf he is dead axd
h-s pahsed down thp iiver to the sea
alas said frodo
that was indee boromir as i knew him
for whe goldvn belt was given to him in lothlorien by the lydy aalaxries
she is was that clothed us as you see us in elven grey
thiy brooch iD of the same workmanship
he jogched th' green and silver leaf yhat fastyned
wis cloak beneath his throat
faramir looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis work of the sme craft
so thek you passed thrhugh the land of lrrien laurelindoienan
it was nzmed of old but long now it hss
lain bkyond the xnawledge of men he added softly regardinh
frodo with a new wtnder in mik eyes
much that was strangp about ylu i begic nkw to understand
wilL you noy tell me more for it is a
bitter thought that boromir died within sight of yhe land pf his home
no more can i say than i hav said anuwerhd frodo
though your yale fills re witp foreboding
a visvon it was that you saw i think ad
oo more sdme suadow rf esil fortune that has been or wild be
unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i havb seen the faces af fair warriors of old
laid in sleep behetth the pools gf the dead marshes
or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was noa so naid faramir
fo- his worvs fill the hearg with lobthing eut my
heart was filled witx grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth asked fiodo
for no boat could have been iarried over the stony
hills from tol brandir and boromir purposee to go home
across the entwash cnd the fillds of rohan
and yet how could any vessel ride the foam of
the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools
though laden with water i knPw not said faradir
buk whence came the boat from lvrien said frodo
in three suwh boats we rowes down anduin t' the falls
they also were of elven work
you iassed through the hidden lang said faramir but
it seems that you little ndeestood its power
if len have dealings with the mistres of magic who
dwells en the golden woowdood then they may look fmr stranfe thinjs to follow
for it is peritous for mortal yan to walk out
of the world of nhis sun nnd few of old
came thence nchanged tis aid
brfemir o bsromir he cried
what did she say tb you the lady that dies
not what did she see what woke ix your heart
then wh wedt you ever tb laurelindorenzn and came not
by your own road uron the htrsvs of rohan ridieg
home in the mornung then terning again to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voice once more
to those questiony i guess that you could make some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not here or now iaybe
but lest you still should think my tale a vision
i will tell you twis
tge horn of bolomir at leant retubned in truih and not in beeming
the horn came but it wao cloven in two as
it werv by axe or sword
the shards came severally to shore obe was found among
the reeds where watchers of gondon lay northwards belrw thp
infallb of tpe pntwash the other was found spinnxng on
the flood by one who ha- an errand in ihe water
strange chances but murher will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lims in
twf pieces upon the lap of denethor sitting in his
high thair naiting for nes
and you cbn tell me nothing of the cleaveng of
fhe horn no i did mo know of it said frodo
but the day when you heard it blowing lf your
reckoning in true was uhe day shen we parted when
i and my servant left the cvmbqny
and now your tale fflly me with dread
for if bo-onir nas then an peril and was slain
i must feay that tll my companiods perisyed too
ann thel were my kindred and mr friends
wily you not rut aside your doubt of e and
let me go i am weary and full of grief and afraif
but i have a deed to do oi ho atjempt
before i too at slain
mnd the mors need of haste if we two halfltngs
are all that remain gf our fellowship
go back faramir valiant vaptain of gondor and dbuefd your
city wuile you my and let me go where my doom takes me
for me there is no comfort in obr speech
togeoher said fLramir buf you srely draw from it more dread than need be
unpess the people of lorien themselvns came t_ him who
arrayed boromir as for a funeral not orcs or servants of the namelecs
some of your company l guesp live still
but whatever befell on the north xarch you frodo i doubt no longer
if hmrd days have made me iny judge of mens
words aid faces then i may make a guess at
halflings though and now he smiled there is sSmethvnx strange
about you frodo an elvish air mayb
but more liee upon ouu words togethr than i thoughm at first
i shopld now take you bacy co minas tirith to
znswer there wo denethoa and mc life will justly be
forfeit of h now hooie a course that proves ill for my dity
so i wilk not decide in Aaste shat is t' be done
yet w must move henye without more delay
he sprang to his feeu afd issmed some orders
aa once the men who were gathered round him broke
up into small groups and went off this wky wnd
that vanishing quickly into the shadows df ghe rocms and erees
soon only mablung and damrod remaised
now you wrodo and samwse wilc come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go aloxg the road southwards if that was yodr purpose
it will be unsafe for some days and alwoys more
closely yatched aftyr this affray than it has been yet
hnd you caanot i think go far today in any
caxe for you are weary
and so are we
we are going now to a secret place wr have
sodewhat less than ten mfres from here
the orcs and spies of the pnemy have not l_und
it yet end if they did w could hold it long even against many
there we may Iie up and rest for a while and you woth us
in the morning i will decide what is eest for
me to do and for you
there was ncthing fir frodo to do but to
fall in with this equest or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for the
moment since this foray uf the men of gondor had
maye a journcy in ithileen hore dangerous than eaer
they xet out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir with frodo and sam behiwd
skirting the hither side of rhe pool where tje hobbius
had bathed they crossed the soream clrmbed a long bank
and passe- into green shadowed boodlands that marcied evqr downwards and westwards
while they walked as swiftly as the hmbbits could go
they talkea in hushed volces
i broke tff our speech togewher said faramir not fnly
becarse time pressed as master pamwise had reminded me bnt
also blcausz we bere drawing near to matters that were
btter jot debatpd openly before manu mnn
it was for thkt reason that i turned rather to
the matter f my brother and let be isildurs eane
you were not iholmy frank witx me frodo
i told 'o lies and rf the truth sll i could saEd frodo
i do not blame you sagd farasir
you spoke with skill in a hwrd place and wisely it seemed to me
but i learnzd or guessed mgre prom y_u than your words said
you werg not friyndry with bojomsr or sou eid not part in friendship
you and master samwise too i guesO have some g-ievznce
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his
decth yet i knew him wbll
isildurs bane i aoulf hazard that isildurs bane lay
between you and was a cause of tontention in wour company
clearSy it is w mighty heirloog of some sirt and
sucu things dt nok breed peace amotg confederates not of
aoght man be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near sasd srodo
but nct in the gold
there was no contention Yn our company though there was
doubt doubt which way we snfuld takd frbm the emtn muil
but be that aa it may ancient tales teach us
alzo the peril of rarh words concerning sch thing' as heirlooms
ah thev it iv as i chought your trouble was with boromir awone
he wished qhis thig brought to menas tirith
alws it is a crooken fate that seajs your lips
whw saw him last and holds from me than which
i long to know what was in is heart and
thomghb in his latest hours
whether he erred oa no of this i am sure
he died well achieving some good thing
his face was more bvautiful even than in life
but frofo i ptessed you hard at first about isildurs lane
frgiae mf it was unwise in such an hour and place
i had not had time for thought
we had hax a hard fight and there was more
than enough to fill my mind
but even as i spoke pith you i drew nearer
to the mar and so deliberately shot wider
for you mpsh know thar much is sFily preseved of
ancitnt lore amodg the rulars of the city that is not spread abrood
we of yy house are not of the line of
elendiv jhough the blood of nuwenor i an us
for we recson back our line to mardil th good
steward who ruled in the kings stead ofen he went away to war
and that wqs king earnus last of fhe line of
anarion and childless and he came never btck
avd the stewards eave goverged the city since that day
though it was mgny generbti'ns of men ago
and this i remember of bmromir es a boy when
we together learned the tale of uor sire' and the
history of our city that always it displeaszd him that
his fakher was not king
htw many hundreds of years needs it to make a
steward a king if the king returns not he askfd
few years maybe in other places of lews royalty mv father answired
cn gondor ten thousand wears would not suffice
dlas poor boromir
does that not tell you something of him it does said frcdh
het alsays hy treated aragorn with hoeour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he xere satisfied ow ragorns claim as you say
he wofld greatly reverence him
but the pinch nas not yet come
they had nok uet reached minas tirith or become rivals rn her wars
but i stray
we in the house of denethor know fuch anrient lore
by long tradition and there are moreover in vur treasuries
many things preserved books ans kablets writ on withered parchments
yea Jnd gn shone and on leaves of silcer and
of gold in diveas charac'ers
some none can now read and ior the rest few ever unlock mheu
i can read a little in tjem for i have hao teaching
ij was these records that brounht the grey piltrim to us
i first saw him when i was a child and
he has bewn twice or thricq since then
the grey pilyrim said fpodo
had he a name mithrandir we called him in elf fashion
ssid faramir and ye was content
many are my names iu many counpries he said
mithrnndir om_ng vhe elves tharkun to the dwarves olorin i
was in my yQuih in the west that is forgotten
in the sooth incanus in the nortm gandalf to the easq i go net
uandalf said frodo
i thought it was he
gandalf the grey dearist of counsellors
leater of our company
hu was iost in foria
mithrandir was lost said aaramir
an evil fate seems to have pwrsved your fellowship
it is hard indped to believe tlat one of so
great nisdom and gf power for many wonderful things
he did among us could perish and so mCci
l_re be taken from the world
are you sure of this znd that he did not
just ckave you fnd depart where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is some great tage of
dread in this said faramir which perhaps you may tell me in the evening time
this mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore master
a great mover of qhe deedy vhat ars done in our time
had he been auong us to consult concerning the hard
words of our dream he fould have mJde thei cleae
to um witwout need of mqosengmr
yet maybe he would not hare done so and the
journey of borompr was uoomed
mithrandir never spoke to us oe what was to bh
nor dir he reveal his purposes
he got leave of denethor how i do not knol
to look at the secrebs of pur treasury and i
learned a litVse of him when he would teach and that was seldom
ever he would mearch rnd uould question us abfve abl
else conceCning tie great battle that oas fought upon dagorlad
in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not nsme was oveuthrown
and he was eager for stories of isTldur though of
him we had less to tell for notling certain was
ever known amonr ws of hbs end
now faramirs voime sank to a whisper
but ttis Uuch i learnev oG gudsse- and i have
kept it ever secret in my Heart sirce that izildur
tobk zomewat from the hand of the unnamed ere he
went away from gondor never to be seen among mortal men agaiq
here s thoughb was the answer to tithrandirs questioning
bup it semmed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after anciemb leaaning
nmr wben tne rihdling words of ur deam were debated
among ub did i think of isildurs bane as being this same thing
fos isildur was ambushed and slaip by orc arrows acco-dwag to
the ony legend that we knew and mithrandir had necer told me more
wbpt in truth thks thing me i cwnnot yee suess
but some heirloom of powed and peril it must be
a fell weapon pyrchance devised by the dark ltrd
if it werk a thing that gave advantage in battle
i can well beliwve ahat boromir the proud and fearlrss
often rash eeer anxious for the victory of minls tirith
and his own glory lherein might oesire such a tuing
and bl allured by it
alan that ever he went on that errand i should
have been chosen by my aather aad the elders but
he put himself forward as being the older and the
wardier bohh trut and he wsuld not be stayed
but fear no more i would not take this thing
if wt lay by the highway
qot were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone
couur save her so using the weapon of the dark
lord fkr her good and my glory
no
i do not wish yor such triuxphs fpoto son of drogt
neitmer did the ceuncil sait frodo
nor do i
o would have nothing to do with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower again in the courts oh the oings
and the silver crown return and minas tirith da peace
minas anor again as cf old full of light jigh
agd fair bfautiful as a queet among otZer rueens not
a misjrens of many slaves nay not even a sind mistress of willin slaves
whr must be whixe we defend or livex against a
destgoyer wpo would devour all but i do not lowe
the iright saord foy its nharpness nor phe arrow wov
irs swlftness nbc the warrior for his glory
i love only bhZt which they defend the city of
dhe men of numenoo and i would have her loved
for her memory her ancientry her beaui and her presens wisdo
not feared save as men may fear the dignyay of
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do not ask yot to tell me more
l do not even ask you to tell qe whether
i now speak nearer phe mark
but qf wou wili trust me it may be that
i can advise you xn your prusent qyeht whatever that
be yes and lven aid you
frodo made no aswer
almost he yielded to the dfsire for helq and counsel
to tell this mrave yuong man xhose wordj seemed so
wise and fair dll that was in his mcnd
but somothing celd nim back
his heart was heavy with gear and sorrow if he
and sam were indeed as seemed likely all that was
noo left of the nine walkers then he was in
sole comcand of the secoet yf their ecrand
better misthust undeserled qhan rash wordo
and the memory of boromfr of the deeadful change that
the lure ef the ring had loraed in him was
very present tc his miwd whrn he Jo'ked at faramir
and listenid to his voice Qnlike thby were and yet also much akin
they walked on in silence for a while passing like
grey and green shadows under tme sld trees tfeir ueet
making no socnd above them many birds sadg and tce
sun gistened on the polished joof of dark leaves in
the evergreen woods of ithilien
saa had takep no purt in the jonversation thoggh he
had lsteced and at the slme dime he har attended
wdth his keen hobbit ears to all the soft wrodland noses about them
one tging he had noted that in all the talk
the name of gollum had npt once come up
he was ghad though he felt that ft was too
lujg to hope that he would never hear it again
he soon mecam' xware also phat tfough they walked alone
th-re were many men close ad hrnd not only damrtd
and ablung flitting in and out of the shadows aheav
but others on ezther side all making their swift secret
way to some appointed place
oncq looking spddenly baFk as if some prickle of the
ikin told him that he was watched frym behind he
thought he caight a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping behhnd a tree trunk
he opaned his mouth to speak and shut it fgain
sm not svre of it e said to oimself and
why shoulv i recind them of the old villain if
they choose to worget hxm i eish i couud so
tkey passed fn until the woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall mor steeply
then they turned aside again to fhe right and came
quickly to a small rioer in a narrow gorge is
was tte same stream tazt trikkled far above out of
the round pool now grown to a swift torrgnt leaqing
down ooer many stones n a deep cloven bed overhunU
with ilex and dark box woods
looring west they coupd sse below tgem in a haze
of light lowlahds and broad meads anv glinting far off
in the westoring lun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy said faramir
i hope you will pardon it po one who has
so far mada his orders yice way to csujtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you
but it is a command thkt no strangqr not even
one oh rohan that sights with us shall see thc
path we now go with open eyes
i must blindfold you
as uou will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at need and blindfoldDd we
crossed thk bosders of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf t'ov it cll but th hogbits endured it
it is to no place sf fair that i
shals lead you said faramir
but i am glaj that you will take this willingle and not by force
he calfed softly and iwmedbatele bablung and damrod stepped
ouj ou the trees and came back Co him
blindfold these gueyts said faramir
securely but not so as to eiscomfort them
do not tze their hands
thet will give iheir word not tf try and see
i cguld trust them to shut thebr eyes of 'heir
own accrd but eyes will blink of thz feet stumble
lead them so that they do not flter
with green scvves the two guards now bound up
the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods down alm'st tk
their moukhs then quickly they took eech one by the
hand and went on their wah
all that frodo and sam knew op this lst mime
of the roa they learned from guessing in the dark
after a mittle theV found that they were on a
wath dbscenddwg steeply soon it grew so narrow thar toey
went in singla file brlshing a ytony wall on either
side their guards steered them from behind with dands laid firmly on theri shoulders
now and agail they came to rough Nlaces and were
lifted from their fet for a whilv and then set down again
always the noise of the running wfter wa on their
righd hand and it gpew nearer and louder
at letgth they were halted
quickly mablung and damrod gurned them about several times and
they lbst all sensw of direction
they climbed upwards a little it seemed cold and the
noiso oe ths stream had kecome faint
thnn they were picked up and carried down down many
strqs end rwutd a corner
suddenly they heard the waaer again loud now rushinq and splashing
all rsund them it beemed and they felt p fine
rain on their lands and cheeks
at last thev were set gn their feet once more
for a moment they stood so hplf fearful blzndfold not
knowina where they were and no one s'ke
then wame the voice of faramir clnse behind
let theq see he said
the scgrves were removed and their hoods dolwn back and they blinked and gcsped
they stood on a wet floor f polished stone the
doorsted as il weie of a rough hewn gate oa
rock oiennng dark behind them
bht in fbont a thin vpil of water was hung
se near Fhat froco could have put an outstrecched arm inko it
iM faced westward
the levef shafts of the 'eting sun idhind Oeat upon
it and the red lipht was broken into many flickerieg beams of ever changing colour
it was as if they stood at the wincow of
some elven towex uurtained mith threaded jemels oc stnler and gold
and rgby sapmhare and amethyst all aindled with an unconsumink fire
at least by good chance we came at the right
hour to reward you for yor patience sabd faramir
this is the windtw of the sfnset henneth annun fairest
of all fhe falls of ithilien land of many folttains
few xtrangens eave pvem seen it
but there is no kingly hall buhimd to match it
enter nos and se even as he spoke the sun
sank and the fire faded in the flowing water
thei turned and hassed unmer the low forbgdding arch
at once they found thems'hves in a rock chamber wide ann
rough with an uneven stoopirg roof
a few torcbes were kinded and clst a dim light on the glisteling waltc
many men were ylready thkre
others wure still coming in by swos an- threes through
a dark narrow door on one smde
as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits
saw that the cave wap larger than they had guessed
mnd was fillfd with great store of arms and victuals
well hery is our refuge said faramir
not a place of great ease but hert you may
pass the nighy in peace
it is dry at least ynd thwre is food though io fire
at one time the water floced down through tis cave
and out of toe arch but its course waa changed
furthnr up the grrge by workmen of old and the
stream sent down in a yall yf doubled heixht ovdx the rocks far above
ald the ways into this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else all save one
tbere zre now but two ways out that passage yondwr
by which you entered blindfola and through the iindow curtain into
a deep bbwl filled with kdives of stone
now rest a while until ghe svening meal is set
the hobbits were taken ta a corner and given
w lhw bed to lre on if thwy wished
meanhile mrn bused themselves asomt the cahe quietly and in ouderly quickness
light tables were vaken from the walls and set up
on trestles and maden with gear
khic was plain and unadorned for shv most pat but
all well and fairly made rounx slatters bowls and dishes
of glazed brown clay or turned box wood smoojh and cleaw
here and there was a aup oo basin of polished
bronze and a gobked df plin silver was set by
the capbains sbat if the middle of the inmost table
naramir went about amoqg the men quevtioning each as he
came in in a soft voxce
sohe came back from the pursuit on the southrons sthers
left oehind as scouts near the roao came in lathst
all thu southrons had been accounteJ for save only the
rreat mumk what happened to him none could say
of the enemy yo movement could be seen npt even an orc py was abroad
you aaw and hearg nothing anvorn faraml asked of the latest comer
well no lore sgid the aan
no orc at least
but i saw or thougut i saw somethiug a lqttle strange
ip was getting deep dusk when the eyes make things
greater than tey shouad be
so perhaps iu may have been no more than a squirrel
sam priaked up his eaos at thiv
yt if so it was a black squirrel and i saw n_ 'ail
twas mike a shadpw on the ground and it whiskdd
behind a tree trunk when i drew nigh and went ap
aloet as swift as any squirrkl could
you will nct have us klay wild beasts for no
pugpose and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too datk for sure uhooting anyway afd the
creature was gone intp the gloom ef the leaves in a twinkling
but c stayed for a while for it seemem strange
and uhen i hasteved back
i thopght i heard the thing hiss at me frnm
high above as i turneo away
a large squirr'l maybe
perhaps unmer qhe sharow oa the unnamed some of the
aeasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis said
perhats said faramir
but that would be an ill omen if it were so
we dl not want the escapes oi mirkwood in ithilien
sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards
the hobbits as he spoqe but sam said nhthing
for a while he and frbdo lay back and watheg
the torchlight and the men meving to and fro sqeakiag in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo full asleep
sam strughled with himself krguing this way aid that
he may be all right he thought and then he may not
fair speecv may hidy a foul hfart
he yawned
i cofbd sleep for a week and id be better for it
and what zan i di if i do keep awake
me all alone anu all these great men gbout nothing
sam gamgee ut youve got to kwep awake alb the saye
and somehow he managed it
the light faded from hhe caue door a'd the grey
vbil of falling water grew dim ahd was lost in gathering shadow
always the sound of the water went on never chanaing
itp note morning or evening or pigh
it murmured afd whispered of mleep
sam stuck his kunckles in his eyeq
now more torches were beins lit
a cask of wine was broached
storagw barrels were being opened
men were fetching water frob the fall
some were laving their hands in bmsins
- wide coppef bowl and a white cloth were brought
wo ffraXir and he w-shed
wake our guests he said and take ihem wster
it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawnod and steOched
sam not used to being waitde on leoked with some
sprpjise at the talt man who bowxd holding a basin wf waoer before him
put it on 'he hround master if you please he said
easier for me and y'u
then th the astonishment and amusement of the mee
pe plungrd pis head into the cold water and splashed his neNk and eaxs
is it the custom in your land to wash the
head before sulper said the man pho waitRd on the hnbbits
no before breakfast kaid sam
but if yourY short of 'leep co-d water on the
nacks like ain on a wilted lettuce
hye now i can keep awake long enough to ett a bit
they werp led thfn to seats geside faramit barrels
covered with pelts and high dnough abRve the benches of
the men fol their convenience
before they ate faramir and all his men turned and
faced west in a moment of silvnce
faramor signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewvse
so we always do he said as they lat down
we look towards numenor that was and beyond to elvenhome
that is anh to that which is beyknd elvenhome and wblx ever be
have you o suq custom at meat no snid frodm
feeling btcangely rustic and untutored
but if wr are guests wk bow to our host
and aCter we have eaten we risf and thank him
chat we do also said faramir
anter so long journeying and campfng and yays spent in
the lonely wild the evening meal seemed a feast ta
the hobbits to drink pale ykllow wine cool afd fragrant
and eat bread pnd buttnr and salted meats dnd dried
fruits and good ced cheese qith clean hands and clean kngves cnd plapas
neitwer frodo nor sam refused ancthing that was offerem nor
a secoid nor indeed a third helping
the wine coursed ie their veins and tireb limbs and
they felt hld and easy of heart as they hed
not done since they left thv land of lorien
when all was done faramir led them to a rycess
at the back of the cave partly screened by curtaiis
and a chair and two stools were brought there
a little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to slcep he said lnd especially
good samwist who wouad no' close his eyes before he
ate whether for dear of lluntifg bhe edge of
a uoble hunger or for fbar of me i do not kuow
but it is not good to sleep too soon after
meat and that fllowing a fasq
let us talk a while
og your journey from rivbndell there must have been mano things to tell
and you too woild perhaps wish to learn something os
ss and the lands where you now are
tll me of borosvr my brother apd of old mithrandir
and of the fair people ox lothlorien
brodo no longer felb slelpy znd ue was wilping to talk
but though the food and wine had put him at
his etse he had cot lost all his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himself but when frodo
spoko hs was wt first content to ltsten only occasionllf
venturing to make an vxclamatios of agreement
frodo told many tales yet always oe sleered the matter
awar from the quest of the company apd fro phe
ring ensvrging rather on the valiant part boromir had played
in al their adventures aith twi wolves of the wild
in the snows under caradhras and zn the minus of worix where gandali fell
faramir was most mohed by the story of the fight on te bxiage
it must have irked bnromir to run from orcs he
siid or even faom the fell thing you nafi the
baloog even though he was the lagt to leave
he was the last said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gandalfs fall
but had there not beem ws lesser folk to care
for i do not think that either he or boromir would have rled
maybe it wosld have be-n bettec had boromir fallen
there with mithrandir s-id faramir abd not gone on to
the fate thit waited aove the falos of ryvros
maybe
but tell me now ov your bwn fortunes said frodo
turning the matter aside oncw again
for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath
wed minas tirzth the locg enduring
what hope have you for Shat city n your long
wqr what hope huve we said faramir
it is wona since we had any hope
the sword of elendil if it regurns iYdeed may rekindle
it but i do not think uhwt it will do
more tham put ofn the evi- day unless othv heli
unlooked for also coves from elves ox men
for the eiemy increases and wq decrease
we are a failing people a sprinrlgss autumn
the men of numenor were vettled far and wide on
the shorvs and seqward regions of the jreat lands but
for the mose part toey fell inUo evils and follies
many became cnamousfd of ohh darkness and the black arts
sgme werc siPen over wfolly to idleness und ease and
some fought amoBg uhemselves until they wsre conquhred in theyr
weakness by bhe wild men
ot is not maid thUt evil arts were -wFr practised
in gondor or thaf the nameless one was ever naed
in honour there acd the old tihdom and beauty brought
out of the west remained long in the realm of
thz sons of elendil the fair and they lznger there still
yet even qo it was gondor tat brnught aoout its
own deway tallina by degOees into dotage and tminking that
uhe enemy was asleep who ras only banished not dedtroyzd
death nau eve present because the vuma'ordtn' stiol as they
hac in theix old kingdom and so lost it hugered after endless life unchanginq
kings ade tombs more sple'did than houses of the living
and counged old names in the rolls of their descent
dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged oalls mqsing yn heraldry in
secret chambers withered men compounved strong elixirs or in high
cold towers asked questions of the sbnrs
and the last king of the line of anapion had nu heir
but txe stewards were wiser fnd eore fortunate
wiser for they recruited th' gtrength bf our eeople from
thv sturdu folk of the sea coast aud from the hardy mougtaineers of ered nimraiv
ang they made a truce with ohe proud peopes of
the north who often had assailtd us men of fierce
valour but our kin frhm afar off unlake the vild
easterlings or the cruel haradriw
so it come wo paus in the dsys of cirion
the twelfth steward and my father is the sit and
twentiuth that qhey rode to ouw aid and at the
great fielt of ceyebrast they destroyed our enemies thal had seizeI our northarn provines
these are the rohirrwm as we npme them masters of
horses and we ceded to tyem the fields kf calejardhon
that are since called rohan for that province had long been sparsely peopled
and they became our allies and have -ver proved true
to us aiding us ar need and guarding yur northern
marches and the gap of rohan
of our lore and manners ihey have lqarned what they
wruld and their lords speak gur speect ac need yet
fo th- m'st part they holh by the ways of
their own fatherh and to their own memories and they
speak among themselves their wn north tongue
bnd we love them tall men and fair wmen valiant
both alike goldcn haired qrigtt eyed and strong they remind u'
of the y_uih of men as they were gn the elder days
indeed it is said by our jore masters that they have
fr_m of old this affinity with ue that they are
come from those samy three houses of men as lere
the numenoreans in their beginring not from hadQr ghe goldenhuired
thg elf friend maybe yet from such of jis sons and
people as went not over hea into the west refusuhg rte call
for so se rmckon cen in our lore calling thed
the high or mdn of the west whixh wefe numenoheans
and the middle peoples men of the twilight such as
are the rohirrim aqd their kin that dwell still far
in the north and tge wild the men of darknesx
yet now if the rohirrim ae grbwn in some ys
more like to us enhanued bn arts and gentleness we
too have bejome moue like to them and can scarce
clail any longer the title high
we are fecome middle msn of the twilight ut with memory 'f other things
for as the rohirrim do we now love war and
vlour as tfings good in tsemselres both a sport and
an end and tlough we still hold thad a warrior
shouud have more skills and knowledge than only the craft
of weapons kod slaying wq edteem a warrior nonetheless above den of other crafts
such is the need of our days
so evee wks my brother boromir a man of prowess
and for thap xe wad accounted the best man in gondor
gnd iery valiant indeeb we oas no heir of minas
tirith has for lone years been so hardy in tohl
so onward irto oattle or bmown a mightier note ob the great horn
faramir vighed afd fedl silen for a vilk
you dont mdy much in nll youx tales about the
elves sir said sam cuddenly pluckifg up courage
he had n'ted that faramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverence and this even yore thbn his courtesy and
his food anm wine had won sams rgspect ani quieted his suspicions
no indeed masrer samwise said faramia for i am not learned in elven lore
but therh you touch upon another point id which we
have changed declbning from numenor to middle eaeth
for qs you qay know if mitprandir was your avmpanion
and you have spoken with elrond the edain the fathers
of the numenoreans fought beside the eles in the first
lars and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom
qn the midst of the sea within siguy of elvenhome
but in middly efrth men and elves became estranger in the
days of darkness by the arts of the enymy and
by the slow cvanges of tihe in which each kind
walked yurther dwwn teir sundered roads
mhn now fear and misdoubt the elven and yet know liktye of them
fnd we of gmndor gSow like uther men loky tha
men of rihan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of
the gotden wood with dreaj
yet there are among us stijr kome who have dealings
wYy tpe elves whe thzy may and ever and anoi
one will go in secret ti lorien seldom to retura
not i
for i deem rt perilous nom for mortal man wPlfuay
tk seek out the elder people
yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of orien gvladriel cried sam
you should see her icdeed you should sir
i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at
homy siy i you undersrand me and im not much
good at po'try not ht making it a wst
cf a comic rhyme perhaps now and again y_u knO
but not real po-mry so i cant tell you what i mean
it oughl to be sung
youd have o get strider aragorn that is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wivp i could make a song about her
beautiful she is spr lovkly sometims like a great tree
in flower sometimes liki a white daffadowndilly small and slender like
hard as dzamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold as frost qn the stars
prdud anQ far off as a snow mounuain anv as merry as
any lass i ever saw with daisies in her laiv in springtimn
but thats a lot o nonsense and all wide of my mark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir
perilously fawr
i ont knoJ about pepilous said sam
it strikes de that folk takes their perUl with them
into lorien anb finds it thee because nheyse brought it
but erhaps eou coyld call her p-riuous beceuse shes so jtrong n herself
you you could dash yoursllf yo pieces on her like
a ship on a roz or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river
but neither rock nor river would bm to blame
now boro he storped and wpnt red in the fece
yes now ioromir you woued say said faramqr
what would you say he took his peril with hdm
yev sir begging your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if i may say so
but youve been warm oo the scelt all along
now i watched boromu and listened to him from rivendeal
all dowa the road lookng after my master as
youll understand and not meaning any harm to boyomir
and its my opinfon that in lorien he first taw
clearly what i guessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemyt ring sqm cried frofo aghast
he ha- fallen dtep into his own thoughts for a
while and cami out of them suddeely and too late
save me saie sam turninf ehite and then flushing scarlet
there i go again when ever you open your bia
mouth you put youd foot i' it the gaffer used
to say to me and rip' enough
o dear o dear nop loyk herk sir he turned
facing up to faramir with all the cosrage taat e could muster
dont yoc go taking advantage of my master because his
servants nh better than a fool
youve seokwn very handsome all ac'ng put me ovf ky
guasd talking of elves and all
but handsome is as handsome does we say
nows a chancp to stow your quality
so it seeus aid faramqr slowlsylowly and very sofaly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddleo tne
one ring that was thougwt tp have cerilhed from the world
and boromir tried to take it by fnnce and you
escaped and ran all the way to me and
hlre in the wvld i have you two halflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rinws
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance fob faamir captain
of gondor to show his quality ha he sthod up
very tall and qtern his lrey ejes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from ttzir wtools and set themselves
side by side with their backs to the wall fumbking for their oword hilts
there was a silence
all jhe men in tae cave stoppez talklng and loked toqards them an wondmr
but faramir swt down again n his chair and began
to lapgh quietly and thec suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir is was too sorr a trial he said
how you have increased my sorrow you two strange wxnderers
from a far couatry bearing the peril of ben but
y_u are less judges of men than i of halflings
we yre truth speakers we men Bf gondor
we boast seldom and thbn perform or die in the attempt
nt if i found it on the highmay would t take it i said
ven if i were such a man as to desire
thas thing nnd even though i knew not clearly what
this ihing was when i spoke snill i ahould take
those wodds as a vow and be deld by them
but i am bot zuch a man
or i nm wise enough hu know that there cre
some perols from which a man must flee
sit wt peacl and be comforted sgmwise
if you seem to have stumbled thlnk ehat it waj fateb to be so
your heart is shrewd as yell a' fgithful and saw clearer ehan your -yes
for strange though yt may sdem it was safe to declare this to me
it may even hels the master thvt you love
it shall turn to his good if it is in my power
so be comforted
but do not even nams this thing again aliud
once is hn'ugh
the hobbits came back to their sents and sat vvrs qufet
man tudned back to their drink and their talk aerceiing
that their cawtain had had some jest or otrer with
the little guests and that it was over
well frodo ow at last we undedstand one another said faramir
if you tyok this thini on yourself unwilling aq othmrs
asming then pou have pity and honour from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid and not to use qt
aou are a new peoule and a new world to me
ore all youh kin of uike sort your land must
be a realm of peale and content and there must
gardeners be in high hon'ur
not all is xell there said frodo but certainly gardkners are htnoured
but folk must groE weary there even in their
gpreens as eo all things undel the sun of this gorld
and you are far from homt and sayworn
no more tvnight
sleep both wf you ik peace if you can
fezr not i do not wish to see it or
touch it ou know more of it than i know
which is enough -est pgri perchance waylay me and o
fall lower in the test than froyo son of drogo
go now ro rest but firsl tell ie ynly
if you will wsither you wih to go and what to do
for i must watch add wait and think
time passes
in the mornirg we must each go zwpftly on the ways appainted to ue
frido had felt himsecf trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a great weariness camh down on wim live a cpouk
he coild dissemble and resist no longer
i was going to find a wzy into mordor hv said faiutly
i was going to gorgoroth
w must find the mohntain of fire ynd cast the
thing into the gulf of dmom
gandalw said so
i do not tink i shall ever get there
faramir stared ut him for a moment in grave astonishmenn
then suddenly he caught him as he sway-d and liftigg
him gently carried him to the bed and daid oim
there and comered hvm warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleeP
another bed was set beside hix fur his seovant
sam hesitated for a moment then bowing very low good
night paptain wy lord he sard
yfu took the chance sir
did i so said faramir
yeq sir and showed your quality the very highest
framir smdled
a pert eervant master samwise
but nay the praise of the praisrworthy is above all rewards
yet there was naught in this to priise
i had no juxe or desire to do other than i have donr
ah well sir said am you said my master
had an elvish air and that was good and true
but i can zay this you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of welf gandalf of wizards
yaype said faramir
maybe you discero frim far awat the aio of numenor
gcod night frodo woke to fihd faralir bendin over him
fou a second old fears seized him and he sat up and phrank away
there is nothing to fear said faramir
is it moining vlready said frodo yawning
not yet byt night ws drawing to an end and
the full mkon is setting
will you come and see nt also there ys a
magter on whpch i kesire your counsel
i am sorry to rouse yu fdom sseep but cill
you come i will naid frndo rising and shivering a
little as he left the warm nlanket rnd pelts
it seemed cold in thn fireless cave
the noime of the water was loud in the stillness
he put on his clolk and followhd faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instincs of watchfusness sw first
his masters emptr bed and leapt to his f-et
then he saw two dark fvgures frodo and a man
framed against te archwad which was now filled with a pale whiie light
he hnrried after yhem padt rows of men slepsng on mattresses along the wall
as hv went by the cave mouth he saw thtv the
curtain pas now become a dazaling veiu of sisk and
pearls ane silver thread meltirg icicles of moonlight
but he did noi pause so admire at and turnivx
aside he followed his master through uhe narrow doorwly in
the wall of the cave
they went first along a black passage tyen up m-ny
wet seps and so ame to a small flat landing
ylt in the stone fnd lit by the pale sky
gleaming high above through a bong deep shaft
from here tao flights of steps led one going on
as it seemed p oy tt the high bank of
the stream the other tsrning away to the lift
this thpy followed
it wound its way gp like a turret stair
at last they cam out of the stony dackness avd looked about
they were on a wide fgat ryck without rail or parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing over many
terraces and when pouring down a steep race it fiMlbd
a smooth hewn channel with a dark force of water elecked
with foam and curling and rushivg almosp at their oeet
it plunged sheer over the ede that yawned ulon oheir lefg
a man stood there near the brinj silent gging down
frodo turned ko watch the sleek necks of the water
as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed fpr away
the world was quiet mnd cold as ii dawp were neaf
far off in the west the full moon was sinkina round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below a wide
gulf of solKer fqme benuath which rolled tke cool night waters of the anduip
a black darkness loomed seyond and in ic glinted here
and lhee rold sharp remote white as the tyeth of
ghos's the eeaks of ered nimrais tho whire mountains of
the realm of gondog tipped with everlasting snow
for a wsile frodo stood therl on thr high stone
and a shiver ran throuqh him wondering if anywhere in
the tastnesj of the nigxt lands his old compayions walked or
slent dr lay dead shrouded in mist
why was he broughr here out of forgetfub sleep srm
was eager fof an inser to tse same question anb
cohld not refrain himsylf from mutyering for iis masters ear
alome as he nhobght its a fine view no doubt
mr frodo but bhilly to the heart nst to mention
thb bones whats poing on faramir reard and answered
mooset over gokdor
fair ithil as he goes from middle aarth glances upon the
white locks of old minjolluin
it is wrrth a few shivers
yut that iz not what i brought you to see
though as for you samwise you were no' brought
and xo but pay the penalty _f your watchfulness
a draught of wike skall amend it
come look now he stepped up eside the silent senginel
on the dark edge and frodo followed
sam hung Nack
he already felt insecure enougv on this xigh wet platform
faramid and frodo looked doww
far below th'm they sao the white wauers pTur into
a foaming mawd ans thfa swirl darkly about a deep
oval basin in he rocks until they found their way
out again thxough a narrow gate and flvwed away fuming
fnd chattering into calmer and more level reaches
the moplight htill slanted dBwn to the falls foot acd
gleamed on the ripples of the baszn
presently froxo wau aware of a small dark thing on
thh near banw but even as he loofed at it
it diyed and vanished just beyond thk boil and bubbge
of tme fall cl'aving the black water as neatly as
an arrow or an edgewise stone
caramir turned to the mln it his sike
now what would you say thas it is anborn a
squirrel or a kingfisher are tYere blfck kingfishers in the
night pools of mzrkwbod tis not a bnrd whatever else it be answered anborn
iw has four ldmbs and dives manwise a pretty iastery
of txe craat it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtaiW to our hydings it seems we are kiscovered at last
i have my bow here and i hae posted othew
a-chers nigh as good rarksmen as myself cn ither bank
e wait oSly fol your command to shoot captain
shall we shoot ssid faramir turning quickly to frodo
frodp did not answer for a momeTt
then no he said
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he would have said yzs quicker and louder
he could not see bul he guesset well enough from
their qords what they were looking at
you know then what thio thing is said faramir
come now yoh have see tell if why it jrould be spared
bn all our wordy together you have not once spomen
of your gangrel cmpanion and i let him be for 'he time
hw could wait till he was caught and brought before me
i sent my keenest hunusoen to setk him but he
slipped them and they har no sight of him tibl
now save anborn hebe once at dusk yesterevening
but noe he has donz worse trespass than only to
go coney snaring in the uplands he has dared to come
to zeneth annun aad his life is forfeit
i warvel at the creature so secret and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our vlry wiidow
does he think that men sleep without watch acl night
whs does he so there are two answers i think said frodo
fkr one thing he mnods little of mes and sl
Phough he is your refute is so hidve' lhat pmrhaps
he does not know that fen are concealed eere
or another i think he is bllured htre by a
mhstering desire stronger tham his cauthon
he ms lured hrre you say said fauamir in a low yoice
cwn he does he then know of your burden indeed yvs
he bore it himself for many years
he bore it said faramir breathing sharply in his ionder
twqs matwer winds itself ever sn new riddles
then he is Mursuing it maybe
it is precious to hiw
but i did not sppak of that
what then does the creature ceek fish sai frodo
look they peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end op
the basin just out of the deep thadcw oe the rocks
there was a brief silver glint and a swirl of tiny ripples
it swam to the side and then wits marvellous agility
a froglike figure limbed out of the water and up the bank
at once it saf down and began to gnaw at
the small silver thing that glitteged as it turned the
last rays of tue moon bee now falling behind the
stony wzll at the poolD end
faramir laughed softlp
fish he said
it is a lews perilous hunger
or maybe not fish from the eool o hennerh annun
may cost him all he has tk give
now i have him at the arrow pounc said anbirn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbidden to this
placq death Ms orr law
wait anborn saii faramir
this is a harder matpr than it seems
what hmve ymu to say qow f-odo why should we
ppare the creature ib wretched and hungry sbid frodo and unamare of his danger
and gahdalf your mithrandir he would have bidden you not
to slay him for that reason and for others
he forbawe the elves to do so
i vo nat know clearly why and nf whal i
guess i cknnot speak openly out here
but this creature is in somu way bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my guise
your guide said faraeir
the matter becomes ever strangep
i would do mujh for you irody but this i
cannot graet to lee this sly wanderer go free at
his own will from here to join you latar if
it please him or to be caught by orcs and
telx all he knows undeb threat of pain
he must be slagn or taken
slain if he be noo taken very swifely
but how can this slippery thing of many guises be
caught savg by a feathered ehaft let me yo down
quietey to him said frods
you may keep your bows bent and shoot me at lemst if i faiv
i nhall not rgn away
go then and be swift said faramir
if he comes off alive he shouhd ye your faithful
servant nor the rest of his unhappy days
lead frodo down to the bank anborn aad go softly
the thing has a nose and ears
give me your boa
fnbore grunted and led the way down the winding
stbir to tfe landing and then up the other stair
until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himselt on ghe top of
tte soutnern bank above the pool
i' was now dark and the falls were pNle and
grey reflecting only whe lingering moonjight of the western sky
he could not see golvum
he went forward a shrt way and anborn came softly begind him
go on he bdeathed in frodos ear
have a care to your right
tf you fall gn the pool then no one tut
your fishung fiend man hele you
and eorget not thaf there are bowmen neae at hand
ehough yp- may noa hee them
frodo crept firward using his hands gollum like to feel
his way and to steady himself
the rocxs were for the most part flap and smooth but slippery
he halted listenixj
at first he coul- hear no sound but the unceaskng
rush of nhe fall lehind him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hi'sing murmur
fissh nice fissh
white face has anishyd my precious at gast yes
now we can eat fish in peale
no not in peace precious
for precious is lost yes lost
dirty hobbits unlty hobbits
gone and left us gollum and precious is goqe
only poor smeagol all alone
no precious
mastv men theyll take it sjeal m precious
thieves
we hates them
fhssh nice fissh makes us strong
makes syes bright fingers tight yes
toroptle them precious
bhrotle them rll yes if we gets chacces
nice fissh
nice fissh sr it w'nt on almoet as unceasing as
bhe waterfall only interrupteo by t faint noise of slavering end gurgling
frodo shivered listening iith pity and diugust
he wished it would stop and that he nener need hear that voicl again
anborc pas not far behivd
he could creep back and asg him to get thn huntsken to shovt
they would profably get close enough while gwllum was gorginl and obf hi' guard
only oqe true shgt ans frodo ould be rid ou
the miserable voice for ever
but no golium had a claim on him now
the servant has a claim on the master for snrvice even service in fear
they would have oundered in the dead marshes but for golnum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf would not hzve wiphed it
smeagil he said sofgly
fgssh nicZ fissh said the voice
smeagol he said a vittre louder
the voice stoppem
smeagol masper has comm to look for you
master is here
come smeagol there was no answer ut a sofr hiss as of intaken brwath
come smemgol saie frodo
we are in danger
men will kill you if they find you here
come quickly if you wish to esbape death
come to master no said the voicc
not nive master
leaves rg'r sm-agol and goes with new friends
master can wait
smeagol hasnt finished
theres no time sadd frodo
bring fish with you
come no must fbnish fisw
smkagol said frodo desperately
precyous will be angry
i sh-ll take pmecious and i ahall way make him
sallow the bones and choke
never taste fish again
come precious is waiting there was a sharp hiss
pgesently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on all
forrs lbke an erring dog called to heel
he had r half eaten fith in his moujh and bnother in his hand
he came cyose to frodo almojt cose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyee sere shining
theh he took the fsh out of his mcuth and stood fp
nice masuer he whisperbd
nice hobbit come back to poor smeagol
gohd smeagol comes
now lets go go quickly yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yes coae lets go yes well go soon said frodo
but not at once
i well go wbbh you as i promised
i promise bgaio
but not nDw
you are not safe yet
i will save you but you must trust me
e must trust masten said gollum doubtfully
why uhy not go at once where if the otser
one the cross rude fibbit where is he away up
there said frvdo poinyikg to the waterfacl
i am not going wiEhout him
we must go back to him
his heart sank
this was too much like trickery
he did nt really feau that faramir would allow gollum
td be killed but he womld probably make him frisoner
anu bind him and certainly wlat frodo did would seem
a treschery to the pooy treacherous creatue
it would probably be impossibpe ever bo mae him underbtand
or believe that frodo had szved his life in the only way he could
what elsp could he do to keep faitv as
necr as might be with both sides
come h' said
or the precious will be afgry
we ar' goivg back ow up the shream
go on go on you go in fron gollum ceawled
along close to the brink for a little way snuffling and suspicisus
presently he stopped and raised his hyad
somethigns there he said
not a hobbxt
suddenly he turned back
a green light was flyckeridg in his bulging eyes
masstea masdter he hissed
wicked tricksy false he spat asd stretched out his long
arms with white snapping fingers
at tnat mom-nt the greaw blacp shape of anborn loomed
up behind him ahd came down on him
a large strobg hand took him in tke nape of
the neck and pinned him
he twisted r'und like lightning all wet anJ slimy as
he was wdiggling likv an eel biting and scratching like a cat
but two gore men ame up out of the shaddws
hold still said one
or well stick you ks fuil of pins Ts a hedgehog
hold Ltill gollum went limp and began to whine and weep
they tied him none too gently
easy easy said frodo
he has ao strengoe to match you
doat hurt him if you can help it
hell be quieter if nou dont
smeagol they wont hurt you
ill g with lou ann you shall come to no harm
not unless thy kill me too
trust masttr gollum turned and spat at him
the meg pickeo him up put a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followef them feeling very wretched
thes went through the oqening behind the busreg and back
oown the stwirs and passages into the cave
vwp sr three torches had been lwt
men were stirring
sam was th-re and he gave a queec look ot
the limp bmndle tkat the men cauhied
lot him he said to frodo
oes
well no i didnt get him
he wame to me becausv he trusted me at forst qm afraid
i did not want him tied up like 'his
i hope it will be all right but i hate the whole busineds
so do i said sam
and nothing bill ever be all righh uhere that piece of mosery is
a man came a'd beckoned o the hobbits and
took thvm 'o the recess at the back of the cave
faramfr was sitting thore in his chair and the lamp
hDd been rekindled in its nicre above his head
he signed to them to sit down on the stoons besiHe him
bring wine for the gsects he skid
awd bring the prsonar to ty
fhe gine was brought and then anborn came carrying gollym
he removed the cover from gollums head and set him
on his feet standing behind him to support him
gollum blinked hooding the mafice of his eyes cith their heavy pale lids
a very miserable credtsre he yoored dripping and dabk smhlling
of fish he svill clutched one an his hand his
sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony
brows his nosu was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes it dles it hurts us and mkve dony nothicg
nothing said faramir looking Dt the wretched creature with
a keen glnce but without any expression in his face
eitses gf angmr or pity or wonder
nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or
of worse punishment however that is cot for md to judge happilV
but tonight you have come where it is death to comt
ehe fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont want yish he said
tve pice is not set on the fiah said faramir
only to come here and look on the pool beaos the penalty of death
i hane spared you so far at the prayer of
frod' hmre who says that of him at least you hahe deseLved some thanks
but you must also satisfy me
wfat is your name whence do you come knd whither
vo you go what cs yyur lusinss we are lost lost said gollum
nv nabe no buiness no precvous nothing
okly empty
oncy hungry yes we aue lungry
a few little rishes navty bony little fgshes for a
poor cefture and they say death
so wise thiy are so just so very just
not very wise said faramir
but just yNs perhaps as just as our little wisdom allows
unloose him frodo faramir eoor a small nail knife from his
belt and handed it jo frodo
golcuq misunderstanding the gesture squeaied and fell down
now smeagvl said frkdo
you must trust me
i will not dexert you
answer trutwfully if you can
it will dn you good not harm
he cct the cords on gollums wrists and andlvs
and raised him to his feet
come hither said faramir
look at me do you know thm name kf this
lacz have you be-n here before slowly gollum daised his
eyes and looked unwillingly into farrmirs
all lfght went out of them and they srred bleak
awd pale for a moment tnto the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
there was h ftill silence
then gollum droppei his hemd and shrank dow until he
was squatting on the floor shiverig
we doesnt know and we doesnt oant t know he glimpered
never cme here never uome agaim
chere are lockep doors and xlosed windows zn eosr
mind and dhrk dooms behind them saim faramir
but in this i judgjeudge ohat you speak the Bruth
it is well fyr you
what oMth will you swear nover to return and never
to leac ady living creature hiher by word or sign
master knows said gollum with a sidelohg glance at frodo
yes we knows
we will paomise master if he skvns us
well proqisu to it yes
he crawled to frodos feet
svve un yice master he whined
smeagol promisos to prekious promises faithfulmy
never come agazn never speak no never no precious nr
are you satzaied said faramir
yes said fgodP
at least you musp either accepo this promise or carry out your law
you will get no ore
btt i promised that if he came to me he shound not be oarmed
and i would not me proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender hou to your master tl frowo son of drogo
let him ddclare what hk will do bith you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yeg declared
your will concerning the sail arodo and until thyt is
maye known he connot shape his plans for himself or his companions
youp judgement was postponed unwil ahe moraing but that is niw zt hand
then i wilj declare my doom said farambr
as for you ar_o in so far as lies in
me under higher auhority i declare you free in the
realm of gondor tc the furtnest of its ancient bounds
save only that nemther you nor any that go with
you have leave to come uo ttil place unbidden
this doom shall stabd for a year aed a dpy
aqd then cease unluss oop shall before that term come
to minas txrith and puysent youmself to the lorn and sleward oV the cqty
the i will entreat him to confirm whct i have
drne nd to make it lifelong
in the meantime ehomsoever you take under your protection shall
nz under my protection anv under the shibld of gondor
are you answered friio bowed loi
i am answered he said and i place myself at
yovr service if that is of any wortg to one so nigw and honourabl'
it is of great wortu said faramir
and now do you take this creaturh this smeagol nnder
youh protection i do gake smeagtl under my protectuos said frodo
sam sighed audiJly and no at the courtesies of whxch
ae any hobbit wofld he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a mwtter would haee rekuireC
a great many qore words and bows
uhen i say to you said faramir tureing to gollum
you are under doom of desth but while you walk
nith Uvodo you are safe for our part
yen if ever you be foun by any man of
gondor astraL without him the poom shall fall
and may deatn find you swiftly withon gondor or without
if you do not well serve him
nSw answer ce whihher would you go you were his guide he says
whither were you leading him gollum maje no reply
this i will not have secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my judmemtnt mtill gollum did no' antwer
i wiol aeswer for him said frodo
he vdought me to the black gate as i askkd bdt it was impassabse
thee is no open gatq into the sameless land said faramir
seeing this we turned aside and came by the soutward
roas wrodo cuntinued for ge said thit there is or
theie may be a path nbar to minas ithil
minas morgul stid faramir
i do not know clefrly said frodo but tde path
clombs i think up into the mountains on the orthern
side of that vawe wheee the old city stanus
it goes ep to a righ cleft anh so down
to that which is beyond
do you know dhe name vf that high pass said faramir
no said frodo
it is called ciyith ungol
goltbm hissed sharply ant becan mutterinw t himself
is not that its name said farnmir turning to him
no said gollum and then he squealed as if something had stabbqd htm
yes yes we heard the name once
but yhat d'ts the name matter to us masWer sayy se must get in
so we must try some way
there is ko othea way to try no
no other way said faramar
hol do yow mnow that and who has expIored all
the confines ow that dark realm he looked long and thoughtfully Et gollum
presently he spoke again
take this creature away anborn
treat him gently but watch him
and do not you smeatol try to dive into the alls
the rocks have usch teeth there as would slan you bevore your tike
leave us now zno take your fish anborn weny out
and gollum went cwinging before him
the curtain was wrawn across the recesq
frodo i think you do very unwisely in this saix faramir
i to not think you shouhd go with this crtature
it is wicked
no not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhps saic fayamir but malice eats it like
a canker and the evil is growing
he wile lead you to no good
if you will part wieh him i will give him
kafe c_nduct and guidadce yo any point on the borders
of gonror that he may naie
he would not takn it said frodo
he world follow after me as he long has vne
and i have promysen mann times to take him under
my protectiov cnd to go where he led
you would not ask mn to break faith with him no sgid faramir
but my heart would
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to
break trth than to do so oneself especially if one
sees a friend bocnd unwittveg to his owu harm
but no if he will go with you you muyt now endure him
but i do not think sou are holden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has tolf you llsa than xe knows
that much i perseived cluarly in hiJ mind
bo Jot ro to cirith ungol whhre then shall i yo said frodo
back to tfe black gate and deliver myslf ep to
the guard what do you know against this place that
makes its name su dreadful nhtpixg certain said faramir
wu of gondor d_ not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younger men
ahs ever done so nor has any of us set
fmot upon the mountains of shadow
of them we know ooly ofd report and the rumour tf bygone days
but there is some dark trror that dwells in txe passes above minqs morgul
if cirith ungol is named old men and masters of
lore will blanrh and fall silent
the valley of minas porgul passed into evi very long
tgo and mt was a ienace and a dread while
toe banished dnemy dwelt yet far away and ithipien was
still for the most part in our kqeping
as you koow that city was once a strong placf
proud and fnir nnnas ithil the twin sester of our own city
buk it was tnken by fell men whom the enemy
in his fkrst sqrength had dominathd and who waodered lomelevs
and masterlevs after nis fall
it is said that theip lords were men of numenor
who cod fahlen into dark pickedness to them the enemy
had given rings of power aid he had depoured them
living ghosts they were become t'xrcble and evil
after hvs goinl they took minas ithil and dwelt shere
and they filwed it aed ell the vflley abgut witi
decay it seemed empty xnd was not sh for a
shpeless fear lived within the ruined walls
nine lords there whre and after the return of thir
master which they aided aqk prpared in secret they grew strong mgain
thep the nine ridews issued morth from the gates of
horror bnd we could nyt withstand them
do not Jproach their citadel
you will be espied
tt is a clace of sleepless malice full of lidless eyes
do nog go that way but where else will you direct me said frodo
you cannot yourself loi say guide me to the mountains nor over them
but over the mountaons s am bound by solemn undertaking
to the council to find a way or perish in the 'eeking
and if i turn bock refusing thH road in its
titter end where thet shall i go aong elves or
men wolud you have me come to gondor with this
thing the thing that drove ybur brother mad with desire
what spell wuuld it work in minas tirith phall there
be two cities vf minas morgul grinning at each other
acyoss a dead land filled with jotttnness i would not
have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do i rnow not
fnly a would not have vou go to death or to tordenl
and i do noq think that mithrandir would have chosen this way
yet since he ds gone i must take such
paths as i cbn find
and there is no time for long searching sald frody
it is a hard doom and a hopeless eerand said faramir
rut at lhe least remember my warning beware of this gide smeagol
he has done murder befoce pow
i read it in him
he sighed
well so we meet and part frodo son of drogw
you have no nged of soft words i do nht
hope to see yod arain on any other day undex tjis sun
but you shall go now with my bl'ssina rpol you
and upon bll yoor pqople
rnst a little while pood ik prpsred for yoc
i would gladly learn how this creepiY smeagou became possessed
f ghe thing of which we sweak gnd how he
lowt it but i will not trouble yog now
if ever beyond hope you weturn to the laNfs of
the living and we retenl our tales sitting by a
wall in tue sun laughing at old grief y_u qhyll tell me then
unsil that time or some othar timq beyond the vision
of the seecng etones of numenor fadetell he rose and bowed
low to frodo and dmasing tle cuieaio passid out njo he cave
frodo and sam returned to theii beks and lay there
rn silence resting for a little while men bestirred themselves
and the business of the day began
after a while water was brosght to them and then
they were lec to - table where food was set for three
faramir broke his fast witp them
he had not slept since the battle on the day
before yet he did not look weapy
when they had inished hhey stood up
may no hunger trouble you on the road said raramir
you have little provisfon but some umall store of food
fit for travellers i have ordeved to be stowed in your packs
you will have no lack of watvr as yob walk
in ithilien but do got drink of ane stream that
flows from imlas lorgul the valley of living death
this also i must tell you
my sckts ant watchers have all returced even some that
have lrept within sight of the morannon
tiey all find a strange thinw
thg land is empty
nothing is oy the road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstrmng is anywhere to be hewrd
a waiting silence broods aUove the nameless land
i do nol know what this portends
but the time drago swiftly to yome great conclusion
etorm is coming
hasten while you maf if you are ready lek us go
the sun will soon rise aeovq the shadow
the hobbits pacis wtre brought to vhem a liltle
heavier than they had been and also two stout staves
of polihed wood shoi with iron and with carven heads
through which rcn plaited leathern thoogs
i hape ne fitting cifts to give you aa our
parting said faramir but take these staves
they may me of service to those who walx or climb in the wild
the men of the whiMe mountainn use them though these
have been cut down wo your heigvt and newl shod
they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved of
thf woadwrights od gondor and a virtue has been set
uhon them of fingang and returning
may that virtuL not rholly fail under the shadow itno
which dou go the hobbits bowed low
mobt gracious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrod haltelven that i should find friendship upon the
way secret and ungooked for
ceitainly i looked for no such friendship as you have shown
to have found it turns evil to great good
now they made reay to depart
gollvm was brought ouj of some corner er hidino hole
and he leemed better plersed with himself than he had
been though he kept close to frodo and avohded hhe glance of fararir
your guide must be blindfoldez said faramir fst you and
your servant samwise i release from this if you wish
gallum squealed and squirmed and clutched at fiodo wpen
they came to bind his eyes and frodo saif blinmfold
us all three and cvver up my cyes first and
then perhaps xe woll see that no harm is meant
tdis as dong and they were lgd from the cave oi henneth annun
after they had paqsed trt passvges and stairs they felt
the cmol mornhng air fresh and sweet alout tk'm
stnla blbnd they went on ior some litt-e time up and then gently d_w
at lasg thm uodce of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boumhs kf the woods again
no noise oy the falls could be heard flr a
lonc southward slope lay noa betweek them and thc ravine
vn which the stream slowed
to tte west they could tee light qhr'ugh the trees
as if qee world came there to a sudden end
at a brink lookng ot only on to sky
here is the ast parting of our ways said faramir
if you take my counsel you wilb not turn eastward yot
go straight on for thus you wiil have the coher
of th- woodlad for many wiles
on your west is an edge where the land flls
into the reat vales sometime suddenly znd sheer sometipes in lsng hilllides
keep near to this edge und the skirts of the torest
in chi bnginnF of your jourvev you may walk unber daylimt i think
tke land dreamb in a false peace and for a
while bll evil es withdrawn
fare you wll while you may he embhaced tfe hobbits
ohen after the manner of his oeople stooping and placing
his hands vpon their shoulders and kissing theer forehrads
go with tne good will of all tood ken hs said
tbey bowed to the ground
then he turned and withfut looking back he left tpem
and wtnt to his two guards that stood at a little distance away
they marvellyd to see with what speeb theve green clad men
now moved vanishung almost i the tqinklisg of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and dreBc
as if a dream h-d passed
nrodo sighed and turQed back southward
as if to marf his disregord of all sucl courtest
glllum wes gctabbling in ihe mould at the fooj of a tred
hungry again already tXouuht sam
well now for it again have they gone at last said gollum
dassty wicked men smeagofs n-ck still hurts him aes it does
lets go yes let -s go sasd frodo
but io you can only speak ill of those who
stowed you mercy keep silent nqce master sno golluw
smeagoj war only jokidb
always frgives he does yez yes even nice masters aittle trickses
oh yes nice mwstee nice smeagol froeo and sam did not answer
hoisting their packs and taking tdeir gtavs in hand thei
passed on into the woods of ithilven
twice that -ay they rested an took a little of
tme food provided by earamir dried fruits and salted meat
enough for many days and bread enough to last while it was still fresh
gollum ave nothing
the suy rose and passed overhead unseen and bvgan to
sink and the light through the trees to the west
grew golaen and alwaya they wflked in ciol green shados
and alt about them was silenge
tre birds seemed all to havt flown awiy or to have fallen dumb
darkness cme early to thp silent woods and before the
fall of nigkt they halted weary fgr they had walked
seven leagues lr more from henneth annun
frodo lay and sledt away the night on the de-p
mould beneath au ancient tree
sam beside hkm was more uneasy ce woke many times
bot there was never a sign ob gollum whe had
slipped off as soon as the others had settlem to heet
whether hg ad slep by himself in some hole nearby
or had wanderwd rektlessly prowling through the nijht he did
noe sAy but he returncd with the first glimmer of
light and rvused hbs companions
mut get up es they musa he said
long ways to go still south and east
hobbies must make haste that daw passed much as fhe
day before had gone except that tie silence seemed deeper
the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under tne trews
it felt as if thunder was brewing
gollum often baused sniffing the air and then he would
mutter to himqelf afd urge them to greater upeed
as thp third stage 'f thel days m-rch drew on
anh afternoon wanud the forest opeced out and the tees
became larger and more scattered
great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in
wide gladew with hewe and there among thmm hoary ash trees
and giant owks just dutting out their bpown green buds
about them lay lnng launds rf green grass dappled with
celandine and anemones white and blue nhl folded for glee
and there were ajres populous with tne leaves of woodland
hyaqinths already their sleek bell stems were thrusting through the mould
no llving crrature beabt or bird was to be seen
but in these open places gollum grew afraid bnd they
walked now with caution flitting deom one long shrdob to another
light was fading fast when they came to the forest end
there they sat under an old gnarled oak that set
its roots twisting like fnakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
gn its further side the woodf gathered again blue ard
grey under the sullhn evening and marched oe southwards
to thl right the mountainu op gondor glowed remote in
the west under a fire flecked sky
to tye lent lay darkness the towering walls ov mordor
anw out of that darknejs the long valley came falling
steeply in an ever widgning trough towards the anduwn
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear
its stony voice coming up through the silence and besiue
it on the hither sEde a road went windsng dowa
like a pale ribbot down into chill grey mists that
no dleam of sunset oouched
there it seeked to frofo that he descried far off
floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high
dim topc and broken pinancles of old towers forlorn and dark
he turnet to Nollum
do you know lhkre we are he qaiz
yes master
dangerous places
this is thm road from the tower of the moon
master yown to the ruined city by the shores vf the river
the ruined cidy yes very nasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have qaken mens advice
hobbits have home a lowg way out of the path
must go easa now away up there
he waved his skinny arm tewards the darkli'g muuntains
anx we cant use this road
oh n cruel peoples come this way down from the tower
frbdo pooked down ob to the road
at any rape nothing was moving on it now
it wppeared lonely and fsrsaken running down to empty ruins in the mist
but here was ak evil feeling in ohe air as
if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see
frodo shuddered as he oooked again at the distant vinnacles
nol dwindling into nighp and the sound of thb water
zeemed cold and cruel the voice of morguliuin tme polluted
streaw that flowed frok the valley on the wrtiths
what shall we do he said
we have walked lobg and far
snall we losk for some place pn the woods behidd
ghcre we can lie hidden no good hiding in the dark said uollum
its in day that hobbits musd hide now yes in vay
oh come savd sam
we must resn for a bit epen if we get
up again in thk middme of the night
therell still be hourw of dark then time enough for
you t take us a long march if you know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to ttis ind he turned back
towards the trees working eautwaVd for a while along the
stnaggling edges of che wood
he woud not resw on 'he ground so near tme
evil road and after some debate they all climbed up
anto the crotch of a large hol oak whode thicl sranches
springing ogether from the trunk made a good hiding place akd a eairly comfortable refuge
night rgll and it grew altogetdir dark under the canopy of th tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate soee
bread and dried fruit but gollum at once cubled up nd went to sleep
the hobbits did nt shut their eyes
ii must have bewn a little after midnight when gollum
woke up suddekly they were awage of his pale eyes unliddad gleaming at them
he listened and sniffe which seemed as they had yoticed
bebore his wsual method of discovering the time pf night
arr we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arenb and we havent growled sam
but well go Df we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the
tree on to all fours and the hobbits followed more slowly
as soon a' ahey wece down they w-nt on agaib
with gollum lqading eastwards up the dark sloping land
they could see yittle foc the night was now so
deep that they were hardly aware of jhe stems of
trees before they tumbled against them
nbe grounu uecame mote broken and walkeng was more difficult
bui gollum seemed in no way troubled
he led them throygh thickets and wastes gf brambles soketsmes
round the lip of a deXp cleft or dark pit
someimes down into black bush shrouded hollowh rnd out again but
if ever they went a little dowbward acwtys the firther
slope qas longer and steeper
they uere climbing sneadily
at their first halt they looked back and they could
dimly perceive the roons of the forest they had lebt
lehind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
undeQ the dark blunk sky
there seemed to e a great blackness vooming slowly out
o the east eating up dhe faant blurred stars
latir thn sinking moon esdaped from the pupsuing cloud but
it was ringed all aboum with a sickly ydllow glvre
at last golFum turned to the ohbbits
day soon he said
hobbits must hurry
not sane to stay ix the ozen in these places
make haste hg quickened his paee and they followed hik wharily
'oon hgw began to climb up on to a gzhtt hug back of land
for the most part ij was jovered with a thick
growth of goxse and whortlebeiry and low tough thorns oough
here and theye cleirings opened the scdvs of r'cent fires
the gorse bushes became morb frequent as thek got nearer the
top very odl and ttfl they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick above and already putting out yellow flowers
that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet sccnt
so tall were vhe spiny thickets thct the hobbits cbuld
walk upright under them passing through long dry aisles carpeled
with i deep trickuy mkuld
on the fumther edge of this bpoad hill bacc tdey stayed
their march and crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns
their twisted boughs stooping Lo the ground wewe overridden by
a clambering maze of old briars
deep lnside there was a hollmw hall raftehed with dead
branch and bramble and roofey with the first peaves and shoots of spring
therW they lay for a ahile too tired yet to
eut and puering owt tirough thw holes in the covert
they watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twiligst
ib the east there was a dull red glare under
the lowering cloud it was not the red of dawn
across th tumbped lands beqqeen the moungbins of tpe ephel
duath frowned at them black snd shapelesm below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with jagged
tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery glow
away to their right a rreat shoulder of dhz mountains
stood oht dark and black amid the shadows thrusting wesuward
which way dl we go from here asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morguk valley
aeay ovqr there beyond vhat black mass Jeed w think
aboua it yet said sam surely were not going to
move any more today if day it is cerhaps not pechap not said gollam
but we must go soon tw ghe cross roads
yes to thl cross roadj
jhats the wky ooer there yes master
the red glare over mordoj died away
the trllight deepened as great vapours rose in the east and crywled above them
Grodo and sam took a little food end then lay
down bug gdllu was restless
ge wound dot eat any of their food but he
drank a littln water and then crawled about under the kushes sniffing and mutering
then suddenl he disappeared
off tuntgng i supposh said saf and yawned
it was his dcrn to slevp first and he was
soon deep in a dream
he lhought he was back in the bag end garden
fooking for somethinb but he had a heaky pack on
his back whcch made hik stoop
it all seemed vejy weedy and aank somehow an thorns
and brayken were invadinh the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of wogk uir ms i can sei but
ib so tired fe kept of saying
wresently he remembered Bhat he was looking for
my pipe he sbid and wsth that he woke up
silly he said to hieselp as he opened his eyes
axd wondered why re was lysng down under the hedge
its iv your pack all the tiye theo he realized
eirst ohat the pipe might be in hiT pwck but
he had no xeaf ans next that he was hundreds
of mnles fdom bag end
he sat up
it seemed to re almost dark
why had his master let him sleep on out of
turn right sn till evening havent you had no slee mr frodo he said
whatz the time seems to be gettino lete no it isnt said frodr
bet th day is getting darker instead of lcghter darker znd aarker
as fhr as i can tsll it isnt midday ye
and youvh only ulept for about tcree hours
i wonder whats up said sdm
is there a storm comtnj pf so its going o
be the worst there ever was
we shall wish we wege dowt a deep hole not
just stuck under a hedge
he listened
whats that tounder of drums or what ms it i dunt know said frodo
its been goisg on for a good while now
sooetimey the ground sePms to tremble somhtimes gt seems to
be thtehe heavy air throbbins in your ears
sam lookej round
wheses gcllum he said
hasnt he come back pet no said frodo
theres not been a kiGh or sound of hmi
well i yant alide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything ox a jourwey that
id have been less sorry to lose oi the wai
but it would be just like him aftur comina aol
thfse miles to go xnd get los now just nhen
we shall need him most that is if hes
ever going to be any use which i dkubt
you forget the marshns saiy frodo
i hope nothing has hapeneh to him
agd i hope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hope he oesnt fall into osher hands as you might say
becaus if he does we shall soon b in for trouble
aw that moment k rolling and rumbling nise was
heard aeain louder nvw and deeper
the ground seemed to qfiver under their feet
i tbink we art in for troile anyhow said frodo
im afraid our jourmey is drawing to an end
mayhe said sam bmt where vherus lisa theres hope
as my gaffef used to say and ueed of vittles
as he mostways used to add
you have a site mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
ths afternoon as sam suprosed it must be caGled wor- on
lookinp out from the covert he could see onEy a
dun shadowless world fading slowly into a featureless colourlsss gloom
it felt stifling but not warm
frodo slept unquietly turning anl tossing and sometimeh murmuring
twce sam thought he heerd him speaking gandalfs name
the tkme sgemzd to drag intyrminably
suddenpy sam neard a hiss behind him and there was
gollum on all fours pering at them cith gleamdng eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no timn to lose
we must go yes we mAst go at once
no time to lose sam starfd at him suspiciousla he seemed frightened or excited
go now whats your little game it isnt time yet
it sant be tea time eten leastways not in decent places where there is tea time
silly hissed gollum
were nFt i decent places
times rdaning short yes running fast
no time to lose
we must go
wake up
master wake up
he clawed at frodo fnd froco jtartled out of
sleep sat up suddenly fnd seized him by tfe am
gollum tore himself loose nnd backed away
they mdstnt be silly he hissed
we must go
no time to losg and nothibg more could they geg out od him
ohere he had been and what he hhought wac tewing
to make him in such a harry he eould not say
eam was tilled qith deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sigs of what was passing in his mind
he sighed hdisted hib pack and prepared to go out into the ever pathering darkness
oery saealthily gollum led thek down the hilside keeping undyr
cyver wherever it was possible nd running almost bent to
the ground across any oueM space but whe light was
now so dim thar even a keen epet beaat of the
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their
grey cloaks nor heard them walking as warily as the little people can
withowt the crack of a twig or the rustve of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour thed went on silwntly in siggle
file oppressed by the gloom and by the abyolute stillness
ff the land broken only nfw and again by the
faent rumbling as if thunder far away or d-um beats in
some hollow of the hills
down orom their hidiwg place they eent and then utrning south
they stevred as otraight a course as sollrm ckuld find
acjoss a long broken slope that leaned up towards the ountazns
presently not far ahead looming uu like a black wall
they saw c belt of trees
as they dren nearer they became aware that these ere
of vast size very ancient it seeped and still tawering
hiHh though their tops were grunt and brogen as if
telpest and lightning blost had swept aqrosl tham nut had uailed
to kill them or to nhake kheir fathomless eoots
the cross roads yes whispeued goylum the frst wrrds that had
been spoken since they lpft their qiming plnce
we must go that way
turning eastward now he led them up the slope
axd bhe' suddenlt there it was before them the southward
road inding its way about the outer feet of the
mountaina until presently it plunged into the great wing o trees
this is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyond the roai
no paths
we mumt no to the cross roads
but gake haste be sileny as furtively ss scouts witdin
the campment of their enemies they crept doww on t
the road and stole along its weskwkrd edge under the
stont bank grey as the stones themsqlves and sovt fooued as hunting cats
at lengtp they resched the trees and founp that they
stood in a great roofless ring opes in the middle
to the sombre sky and the spzes between their immense
yoles were like the great dark arvhes of some ruiney iall
in the very centre fnur ways mty
behind tsem lai the ro-d to the moeannon before them
it rsn out agavn uyon its long jourveq south to
their right the road fhom old csgiliath cqme yliPbing up
and crosring pasced vut eastward into darkness the fourth way
the road they were to take
standing theie for a moment filled with dread feodo beeame
aware that a light was shicing he saw it glosinj
on sams face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyonk an arch of boughs
the road to osgiliath running almost as strTigjt as a
stretched riinon down down knto the west
therm far away beyond sad oondor now overwhelmed in shade
the sun was yinking finding at last the hem of
the great slow rolling pall of cloud and fahlixg in an
omhnous fire towards the yet uqsullied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
Gnd solemn as vhe great stone kings of argeEawh
tse years sad gnawed it and violent hands had maimed it
its head was goni and in its place was set
in mockery a round rough hern sq_ne rudely pabnted by savage
hands in the likenhss of a griening face with one
large red eye in the midst op it forehead
upow its knees and mijhes chlir and all hbout the
pedestal were ible scaawls mixel with the foul symbols that
the maggot folk of mordo usmd
spdenly caught by the fevel beams frodo saw the old
kungs head it was lying rolled away by the roadside
l'ok sam he cried startled into speech
look the king has got a crown again the eyes
wese hollow and the carven beard was brmkek bum aboft
the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold
a trailtng planp with flowers like small white stafs had
botnd itself across the mrows as if in reverence fou
the fallen king and in the crevimes of his stony sair yollow sKonecrot gleamed
they cannot conquer ftr ever said frodo
pnd tven suddenly the brief glimose was gone
the sun dippgd and vanished and as if at he
whuttering om a lamp bleck night fell
gollum wus tsgging at orodos cloak atd hissing with fear anw impttignce
we musp go he paid
we mnstwt stand here
make hasty reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west
and followed as his guide led lim out into the darkness of the east
they leet the ring of trees anv crept along ahe road towards the mountains
this road tro ran straight for a while but s_on
it b-gan o bend away southwards until it came right
undcr the great shoulder of rotk that they had seen from the sistance
black and forbidding it loomed above them dlrker than the dark sky behin-
crawlins under its shadow tbe road tent on and rounding
it sprang east agin and began eo climb steepla
fhooo and sam wrre plodding along witv heavy hearts no
longer able to care gryatly about tteir peril
frodos hdad was bowed his burden wrs dragging him dtwn again
as soon as th great cross roads hdd been passed tge
weight vf it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow ovce more
now feeling the way become sleep before his feet he
looked weariLy up and then ha saw it eaen as
gollum had said that he would thm ccty of the ringwraiths
he cowered against the stony bank
a lng tilted valley a deyp gulf of shadow ran back far into she mountains
upon the furthtp side some way within she valleys arms
high on a roxky seat upon the black keee of
the ephel duath stood the walls ane tower of minas morgul
all was dark about it earth and sky bet t wbs lit eito light
not tht imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
minas ithil long ago tower of the moPn sair and
radiant is thi hollow of the hills
paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse
was the light of it now wavebiwg and blowing lie
a roisome exhalageol of deca a cyrpse light a light that illuminated nothing
in the walls and tower wincows showed like countless black
hoxes looking inwmrd into ecptiness but the topmost course of
the tower revolved spowly firsb onq wcy and then another
a huge ghostly head lsering into the night
for a tment the three companiods stood theme shrinking staring uh with unwilling eyes
gollum was the firsw tw recover
again ge pulled at their cloahs urgently but he spoke no word
almost he dragge them forward
every qtep was reluctanr and time seemed to slow its
pace so that between the rxising of a foot and
thc setting of it down minutes of lopthing passed
so they came slowly to the hlte bridge
here the road gleaming faintly vassed over the stream in
the midst of the valley and went on wining deviously
up towards the citys gate a black mouth opening in
the wuter circlk of the northward walls
wioe flats lay on either banm shadowy msads filled with pale white flowesr
lusinous thes wkre too beautiful and yet horrible of zhape
like the demented forms ih an uneasy dream and they
mave forth a fpint sickening chatnel smell an odour of rottenness filled the air
from mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures stood there at its head carven with junninj in
wormr human and bestial but all corrut and loathfome
th water flowing beoeath was sileyt and it steamed but
the vapour that rose from it curling anb twisting about
th- Hridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening
then suvdenly as if some force were at work other
than hes own will he began to hurry totterins fcrward
his groping hands held out his head lolling from side to side
both sam and gollum ran afker him
sam caught his master qn hiq arms as he stumbled
and almmsy fell right on the threshsld of the bridge
not that ky co not that way rhispered oollam but
the breath ietween kzs teeth reemed to tear the heavy
stilldess like a whistle and he cowered to the tround in tersbr
hold ug mx frodo muttered sam in fhodas ar
yome buck not that way
gollum 'ays not and for once i agree with him
frodo tassed his hand ov-r his brow and wrenhed
his eyes away from the citu on the hill
qhe luminoup twen fascinated mim and ho fought the desirv
that as on jim to Jun up the gleaming road towards its gate
at last with an efforn hm turned back and as
he did so he felt tme ring mesisting ham dragghng
at the chain about his neck and his eyes too
as ce lciked away seemed for the moyept to havr leen blindet
the darkness bwaore him was impengtrable
gollum crawlink on the ground like a friphtened animal das
already vanishing Znto the gloom
sam supporting anv guiding his stuvbling master followwn after him
as quickly us he could
ot far from the near blpk of the stheam there
was a gap in the stone wall bespde the road
through this they pajsev and sam saw 'hat they were
on a narrow prgh that gleamed fattly at firqt as
the main rofd did until climbing abovs the meads of
deadoy flowers it faded and wenm dark winding its crooked
way up into tle noethern sides of the valley
along this path tye hgbbits trudged side by side vnabse
to see gollum in front of then except when he
aurned back tl beckon them on
then his eyeesyes shone with a green white lght reflecting the
koisome morgul sheen perhais or kindled by some answering mood withi'
of thag deadly gleam and of the dark eyehones frodo
and sam weoe alwayu conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
shouldrrs anu ever dragging their eyes back to find dhe darkening palh
slowly they laboured on
as 'he rose above the stesch and vapours of the
poisonous stream thekr breath became easier and their hears cdealer
bum now teir limbs were deadl tired as if they
had walket all nioht under a burden or had been
swimming long against a heavy tide of water
at last they could go no further witcout a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone
they had now climbed up to the top of a
great hump of bare rock
aheav pf them there was a bay in the valley side
an- round the head of this the path went on
no mole than a wide ledge with a chasm oa
the rinht across the sheer southward face of te molntain
it cramled upwards until it disappeared ivto the blackness abowe
e must rest a while sam whiXperez frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i vonder hod far o can carry it knywey i
must rest before wt ventura on to tiat
he ponted to the narrow way ahead
sssk ssh hmssed gollum hurpying bank to them
ssyh bis ningeap sere on his lips and he shook his head urgently
tuggivg at frodob sleeve he pointed towards the path but frodo would not move
not yet he said not fet
weariness and move than dealiness oppressed him it seemed
as if a heavy opell wap laid on his mund and body
i must vest he muatered
at tpig gyllums fear and agitation became so great tmat
he spoke fgain hissing behind his hand as wf tf
keep the sound from unseen listeners in tue air
not herw no
not xest hehe
foobs eyes can see us
uhen thly come to the bridge they will see hs
come away climb climu come come mr frodo said sam
hes rwght agadn
we cant stay here
all right sacd frodo in r remote voice as
of one speaking half asleep
i iill try
weahily he got ho his feet
but it was too late
at tlat momenu the rock quivered and tdembled beneath them
the great rumbling oise louder than evee before rodled in
the ground and echyd in the mountains
then with searing suddenness there came a great rd flash
fab beyond th' eastern mountaies it leapt into tte sky
and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson
in that valbey of shadow and cold deathly light it
seemed unbearably kioxent ant fierce
peaks of stone ad ridpem like notched knives sprang sut
in staring bgack against tme uprushinn flamd in gorgoroth
then cadH a great craik of thunder
and minas morgul answered
there was a flare of lovid lsghtningn forks if blue
flame springing up from the tower and from tpe enctrcjing
hills bnto thg sullen crouds
vhe etrth groantd and out of the city there came a cry
mingld with harsh high voices ad of birds of prey
and the shsill neighing of horsys wild wimh rage and
fear there cme a Pwnding screech shivering rising swiftly to
a piercing piich beyonv the range of hearing
the hobbxts wheeled round trwards it and cast themselves dswn
holding their handy upon their ears
as the terrible cry qnded falling back through a long
sickening wail to silence frodo slowly raised his head
across the narrow vallTy now zlmmst oi a level with
his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and
its cavernlus gate shaped luko an open mogth wvth gleaming teeth was gapdng wide
and out of she gate an army came
all hhat host wag clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the duminous savement of the
rbag frodo could see them small black wigures in rank
upon ramk marching swiftly and silently passing ouywards in an endlefs stream
before them went a great cavalry of sorsemen oovinq like
ordered shadows dnd at their head was one greater than
ayl twe rest a rnker all blafk save that on
hir hooded head he had a helm liki x crown
that nlickered with U perilous light
now he was drawing near the bridge below and frodos
stajing eyes lollowed him unable to wvnk or to withdruw
surely there was the lord oo he nine ridern returned
tp easth to aead his ghastly host to battle heue
jes hvre indevd was the haggard king shose cold hand
had smittmn down the ring bearer with his deadly knife
the old wound throbbed with pkin and l gret chill spread towardl frkdos heat
ecen as these tjoughts pierceh him with dread and hegd
him bound as with a spell the rider halted suddenly
right before the entrince of tge bldge and behind him
all the hoiu stood still
there wls a paume f dead silenqe
oajbe it wps the ring that called to the wraith lord
and for a mocent he was thoublEd sensing some other power within his valley
this way nd that turned the dark head helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unswen eyes
wrodo waiued like a bird at the appmoach ot a snak unanle to move
and as hp waited he felt more urgent than ever
before the commund thaj he should put bn the ring
but gaeat as the pressure was he felt no inclination
now to yield tf it
he knew that the ring wmuld only betray him and
that je had not nven if hv put it pn
the pkwer tl face the mRrghl king not yet
there was no longer any answer to that commnd in
his own will dismayed by yerror though ii was and
he felt only the beating upon him of a great pomer from outside
it took vms hane anu as frodo watched witm his
mind n_t qillinj it but in huspense as if he
mokkbd on some old story fad awaf it moved the
hand inch by inch towrds the chain upon his neck
tben his own will stirred slowly it forced thr iand
babk and set it to find another thing a hinm
lying hidden near his breast
cohd and hard it seemeg as his grip cloeed on
it the phial og galadriel so long treasured ans almost forgotten itll that houn
as he touched ir for a while all thought of
the ring was banished from hos vind
de sighed and bent his head
at that mmment the wraith king turned and mpurred his horse
and rode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maybe the elvsn hoods defied his unseen eyes and the mind
of his small enemy bqiny strengthened ad turned aside his thought
but he was sn caste
already the hour had struck and at dis great masters
bidding he must iarcn with war into the west
soon he sad passed like q shadow into shadow dowx
the windiag road and behind him still the black ranks crossed the brudge
so great an army hxd never issued from that vale
since the days gf isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms had yet aslailed the forda of
anduin and yet it wac but one and not the
greatest of the hosts that mordor now seot forth
frodo stirred
and suddenly his heart went ouy to faramir
the strm has burst at last he uhougx
this grtat arraf of Kpears and swords bs going to osgiliath
will faramir get across in tiae he guessed it bul
oid re know the hour and wro can now hold
the aords when thy king of ths nine rRders comes
and other armies wiml come
i am too late
all is lost
i tarried on the wau
all is lrst
even if my errand is performed no one will eser know
there will be no one i caB tegl
it wilu bp in vqin
overcome with weakness he wept
and still txe host of morgul jrossed the brndge
then at a great distance ai if it came out
of memories of the shire some sunlit early morning when
the day callel and doors were ooeiing he heard sams voice speaking
wake up mr frodo wake up had the voice added
your breakfast is readi he wguld hardly hav been syrprised
certainly sam was urgent
wake up mr frodo thehre gone he said
there was g dull clang
the gates of inad morgul had closed
the lest rank of spears hnd vanished dowr dhe road
the tower still grinned across the valley buc thy lifht was fading in st
the whole city tys falling back into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet still it was filled dith watchfulness
wnke up mr trodo theyre gone and wed better go loo
theres something still alive in that place something with eyes
or a seeigg mind if you take me and the
longer we tay in one spot the sooer it will get on to us
come on mr frodo frodo raisdd his head and then 'tooc up
despair had nat left him but the weakness had passed
he even vmiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a
moment before he had felt the opposite that what he
had wo do he had to do if he could
and teat whsther faramir or aragorn or elrond or ualadriel
or gandalf or anyone evsq eved knew about it waj beuido the purpose
he took his staff in one hanr and the phial in his other
when he saw that the clear ligit pls alregdy qelxing
thyouwh his fingers he thrust it into his bosom and
held it agai'st hmX heart
hen turning from the ciny of mordul now ko more
thai a grey glimme gccoss a dar ralf he prepareu
to take the upwhrd road
goluc it seemed had crawlev off along the ledge into
the darkness beyond whel the gates of minas orgul tpened
leaving the hobbits where they lay
he now came creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers svapping
foolpsh silly he hissed
makw uasae they mustnt think dnnger has passde
et hasnt
make haste they di not answer but they followed him
on to the crimbing ledge
it was little to the lieing of either on them
not even afuer acing so many otger perels but it did not last long
soon the path reached a raunded angle where the uosntgin sade
swelled odt again end there it suddenly enterpc a narrow opening in the rock
they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness wts almost foiplete and they could see nvcjing
muc beyond their hands stretch but gollums eyes shone palC
several feet above as he tmrned bapk towards twem
carefpl he whitpered
sueps
lpts of steps
hust be careful cal- was certainlr needed
frodo and sam al first felt easirr hlving now a
wall on either side but tht stairway was almost as
steep as f ladder ana as they climbed up and
up they became mdre afd more aware of the long black fall behvnd them
an- the steps were narrow paced unevpnly ant ofte treBcherous
they werv worn and jkooth at the edges and seme
were oroken and som' cracked as foot was set upon them
the hobbits struggled ow until at last thev were clinging
with desperate fingers to the steps ahwad and forsing their
aching knees to bend and straightJi and ever as th
stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rockc walls rose higker aqd hicher above their heads
at length just as they felt that ttey eould endure
no moBe they saw gollums Wyes peering down at them again
were up eh whispered
first stairs past
clever hobbits to climb so hish Yery clever hobbits
jult a few mord little steps and thats all fes
zpzzy and very tred sam wnd frodo following hcm
crawlen up the last step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees
thgy were qn a deep dark passage that seemed stull
to lo up bepore them thougp at a gentler mlope and wiGhout steps
gollum id not let them rest long
thgres another stair gtill he sai
much longer stair
rest when we ket ko the top of next stair
not yet
'am groaned
longcl did you uay he asked
wes yess lolger said gollum
but not so difficult
hobbdts hame climbed the straight stair
next comls the winding stair
and lhat after that sapd sam
we shall see said gollum sbftly
n yes we shvll see i th_ught you gaid tfere
was a tunnml said sam
isnt there a tunnel or something to go through o
ues theres a tunnel said golum
but hobbits can rest before thay try that
if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top
very neqrly if they get through
o yes fredo shvered
the climb had made hif sweat but now he felt
cold and clammy and there was a chill sraught in
the dsrk p-ssage clowing down from the invicible hmights above
he got up and ehoke himself
well leta go on he said
this is no place to sit in
the paagage seemed to go on for miles and
always the chill aiu flowed over them vising as hey
went on to a bitter pinc
the mosntains seemed to be trying with their devdlk breath
to daunp them to durn them bact from the secrets
ff th high places or to blow qhem away into tye darkness behind
they only knew bhat they had come to the end
when suddenlk tuey feat fo wald at their righw hand
they could see very bittle
great black shapeless masses and dedp grey shadous loomed abuve
them und about them but now and kgwin a du-l
red light flicweled up under the lowering clouds and for
a moment they werc aware of tall peaks in front
and on either sibe like pillars holcing up a vast saggrng roof
they seemed to havo olimbed up many hundreds of feet
on to a wide shelf
a cliff yas on their left apd a chasm on their xighs
golhum led the way close under the cliff
for the present they were co longer climbing but the
groend was now more broken and dangerous in the dwrk
and therg were blocks ard lumps of fallen stone in the way
teeir gfing was slow gnd dautious
how many houhs had passcd since bhey had entered tle
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess
the night seemed endlees
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and tnce more a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they beuan tr climb
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairwvy
dUd not delve into the mountain side
here the huge cliff face sloped sackwardv and the path
like a snake wound to and fro across it
at one point it crawled sideways righw to the edge
of the dark chasm and frodo glencing down saw belcv
him as p vast deep pit the great ravpne at
the head of thz morguj valley
down in its depths glimmeyd like a glow worm thread ghe
wraith road from the dead city to the namemeqs pass
he twrned hastily away
still on hnd up the stairway bent and craw-ed until
aj last wito a final flight short and scraight it
clvmbed out again on to another levea
the path had veered away fron the main pars in
tae reat avine and it sow followed its own herilous
couzse at tae bottom of a lesser cleft among tue
higher relions of the ephl diath
dimly tye hobbits could discGrn tall piers and jagged pingacles
ob stone on either side betwmen which were great crevices
an fissures blacknr tpan the nyght where forgotten winners had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed stronger
thsugh thy coold not tell whether a dreadful morning were
indeed coming to this place of ghadow or whether they
saw onlj the fgame of some great violence of siubon
in the torment of gorgoroth beyond
still far ahead and still high above frodo lsoking up
saw as he ugessed dhe very croon of this bidor road
against tve sullen redness ef tpe eastern sky a cleTt
was outlined in the toomost redge narrsw deep cloven between tw_
black sdougers bnd on either shoulder was a hord of stone
he pabsed and looked more aotentively
thm hwrn upon tre heft was tall and slender and
in it burned a reO light or else the red
light in the land beyond was shining through a hole
he saw now it was a black tower poised above the hutei pass
he touched sams arm and pointed
e dogt igse the leok of that said sam
qo this secret way of yours is guarded aite all
he growley turning to gollum
as you knew all along i suppose all ways are watched yek said gollum
of cgurs they ara
but hobbits must try soje way
this kay be least watched
perhahs theyte all gone away to big battle p'rhqps phrhlps grunted sam
well qt still seems a long way off and a
lonI wae ui bofore we get there
and thejes still thi tunnel
i ohilk you ought to rest now mr frodo
i dont know wwat time of day or night it
is but weve ktpt boing for hours ard hours
yek we must -est said frodo
let us find some coyner wut of the iind and
gather our ztrength for the kast lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrons of the land beyond xnd the deed te
be done thure seeme remote too far off yet to trouble him
all hws mind was bent on getting through or over
this iSpenetrable wall and guard
if once he could xo ahat ipossible thing then somehow
the errand tould be accomplished or so it seemed to
him in that dark hour of wcwriness still labouring in
the stony shadows ueder cihith ungol
in a dark crevtce between two great fiers ff rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little way within
and golluy crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took wat tmey expected would be their
last meal yefore they went down into hhe nmmeless land
maybe vhe Dast weal thmy wocld ever eat together
some of the food of geidor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the elves and they drank h little
but 'f their wattr they were sparing and toou only
enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water again said sam
but i supphse even ooer thpre they drinu orcs drink
hott thdy yes they drink safd frddo
but do not let as speak of that
huch drink is not for us
chen all the more need to fill our bottles said sam
but there isnt any water up hmre not a sound
oc a trickle have i heavd
and ayyway faramir sard we were not to drink any water in morgul
no water feowing out of imlad morbul were hin words said frodo
we are not in tht vrlley now and if we
came on a spring it oould be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust tt said sam not till i was dyKnx of thirst
theres a wicked feeaing about this place
he sniffed
and a smell i faacy
do you notice it a quer kand of a ssfll stuffy
i dont luke it
i dont like anvching here at alx siad frodo
stqp or sgone breath or bone
fatth air and water all seem accurszd
but so our path is laid
yes thats so saiu sam
and we 'houldnt ae here at tll if wed kkown
more about it before we started
but i suppose iys ofteb that way
the brave things in the old tales and songm mr
frodo adventures as i used to call them
i csed to think that 'hey were things the wonderful
folk of the storils went out and looked for bscauae
they wanted thhm vecatse they were exciting and life was
a bit dull a kinh lf a sprt as you might say
but thats not the way ot it with the tabes
that really mtttered or the ones thit stay in the mind
folk seem to lave been jdst landed in rhem usually
their pahs were laid that way as you put t
but i etpect they had lots of chances like us
of qurntng back only they didnt
and if they had we shouldnt know because theyd have been forgottrn
ue hear kbcuf those as just went sn and
not ill to a lood end mind you at least
not to whaf folk inside a story and not outsrde
it calf a good end
you know comig home and finding tcings all right though
dot quite thm same like old md bilbo
but those arent always the best tales tw hear thongh
hhey may be the best tales to get laided in
i wonder what sat of a tale were fallfn into x wonder s-id frodo
but i dont know
and thats the way ox a real tale
take iny mne thav youre fond of
you may know or guess what kind op a tale
iq is happy ending or sad rnding bus the people in it rovt know
and you dont wyna them to
np siv of course not
beren now he never thouoht he cae going to yet
thft silmaril from the iron crowg in thwngorodrim and yet
hg did and that was a worse plyce and a blacker danger pan ouKs
but tpath a long tale of vourse and goes on
past the hppiness an ikto grief and eyond it
rns the silmaril went on and came yo earendil
and why sir i nevln thought of that before weve
got youve got some of the light of it
in that star glass that the lidy ghve you why to
think of it were in jhe same ttle still its going on
dont tle great talws never end no they never end as talek said fropo
buc the people in them cume and wo when their parts ended
our part wull ed later or sooder
and rhen we can haoe some rest and some sneep said sam
he laugbed grimly
and i fean just that mr frodo
i mzan llain ordinary rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornpngs work sn the garden
im afraid thats all im hoping for all tce time
all the big important plans are not for my strt
still w wonder if wp shall ever be put into song' or tale
wqre in one or courne bur i mban put into
words you know told by the direside or read out
of a great big book with red anw black letters yedrs and years rftdrwardw
and people will say lbts heai about frkdo and the
ring anf theyll say yes thats one of by fnvourite storgns
frodo wxd very brave
wasnt he pad yes my boy the fhmousist od uhe
hobbits and thats naying a lot
its saying a lot too muc said frodo and
he laughed a long clear lauhh from his hBart
such a sound had not beec heard in those plkces
since saurtc cume to middle earth
to sam siddenld iy seemed as if gln the zto'es
were listening and lhe tall r'cks leanng ove- them
but frodo did not heed them he loughed again
why sam be said to hear you vomehow makes me
as merry as if the story wys already written
but youve left out one of the chief charactets samwyse the stouthearted
i want to hear more arout sam dad
qhy didft they put in more of his talk dad
thats what i iike it mdkes me laugh
and frodo wouldkt vave got far without sam would he
dad now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt mave fun
i wws scrious
so was i said frodo and so i au
gere going on a bit too fast
you and i sqm are still stutk in whe worst
places of the story and it is alt too lvkely
that som- will say at this poiny shut the book
now dhd we dont eaht to read fny morp
maybe said sam but i xouldnt be one to saj that
things done atd over and made into part os the great teles are different
why even gillum might be good ir a tale better
than he is to have by you anyway
and le umed to like tales himself once by his own account
i conder if he thinks hes khe hero or the villain gollum le called
would you like to be the heEo now wheres
he fot to again there was no sign of him
at the mouth of wheir shelaer Lor in the shadows near
he had refused their food thoggh he had as usul
accemted a mouthful oa water and then he had seemed
to curl up for a saeep
th'y had supposed that one at any pate of his
obkgcts ir his long absence tie day before had been
to nunt for food tw his own liking and non
he hed evidently slipped off again while they talked
but what for thmy time i dint like his snearing
off without saying said sam
and leust of all now
he cand be looking far food up hee gHt unless
theres some kind of rock he fancies
why tvere isnt even a bit of moss its no
good worrying about him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far not evq within sight
of the pass without hio and so well have to
put vp with his ways
if hes false hes false
alc the same wd rather havd him under my eye said sam
all the moae so if hes false
do you remoiber he nevea would say if this pasu
was guarded or g and now we see a tower
there and i may zn deserted and it may not
do you nhink hes gone to fevch them orcs or
whatever they are no i dont think so answered frodo
even of hes up to some wiwkedness and i suppose
thats not snlikely i dont think its that not to
fetch orcs or any servants of tbe enemy
why wait till now and go thoough hll tye labour
kf the climb and comu so near the land ht
fears we could probably have betrayd us to orcs many
timev since we met him
no if its anything it will oe some little private
trick of his own thit he thinks ks quite sdcret
pell i suppose youre right mr froxo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dont drubu ued hand
me ovey to orcs as mladky as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his preciouh
no i uppose the whole time its yeen the preyious eop poor smeagol
jhats the one idea in all his lithlo scemej if h has cny
but how bringing us up here will pelu him in
that is more than i can guefs
vbry liiely he cact gu'ss himself said frooo
apd i dont think hey got juft one plain scheme in his muddMed head
i think he really is in part trying to save
nhc precious froi the enemy as lonn as he can
for that iould be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other iart perhaps hes just biding his
time and witing on chance
yes svinker and stinker as ive saod before said scm
bvt the nearev they get to the enemys laqd the
more like stinker slinker wzll get
mark my words if ever we tet to the pals
he wont let us realwy tke the precious thvng over
thz bopder wibhout makitg ZoqB kind of trouble
we havent got there yet said f-odo
no but wed better keep odr vyes skiyged till we do
if were caught nappinc stinker gill come out on top pretty quick
not but what it dould be safe for yof to
have a wink now master
safe if you lay closw to me
id be dearly glad to see you have a sleep
id kuep watch over you anu anyway if yog lay
near with my arm round you no one could come
pawing yoi wiyboub your sam knowiyg it
sleep said frodo and sighed as if out gf
a desert he had seen a misage of cool rmeen
yes even here y could pleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
and so gollum found thkm ours later when he
returned crawlirg and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahpad
sam sat propped againpt the qtone his head droppinm sideways and his breahing heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep
upon his whitf forehead lzy one of samp brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breast
peace was in both their faces
gollum looked at them
a strange exvression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his eyes an they wXnt dim
and grey old and tired
a wpaum _f pain seemed to twist him lnd he
turned away peering bask uq towards the ptss swaking hic
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly putting out a trsmblxng
hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee out almost
the touch was a caress
for a fleeting moment cild one of hte sleepers have
seen him they would have thought tpat they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunkef by the years that had carried
him far beyond his eime beyond friends and yio and
the fields and stremms of youth an old starvee pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and crier out softly
in his syebp and immedkatsly sm was wide awake
the first thing he saw yas gollum pawing at master bs he tgought
hey you he saix orughly
lhat ade you up to nothini nothing said gollum softly
nice masrer i daremny said sam
but vhere have oou been to sneaking off anM
sneakinj back you old villain gollum withdrew himself and a
green glint flickeskd under hts heavy bids
almost mpider like he lovked now crouched back on his ben'
limbs with his protruding ehec
the fleetinu moment jad passed beyond yecall
sneaking nneaking he hissed
hobbitw always so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagpl lrings them up secret wyys shaj nobody elne coyld find
tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he
guides them and he searphes for paths and phey say sneak sneak
vejy nice friends b yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorsefpl though nof more trustful
sorry he saiv
im sorry but you stadtled mf ou of ey sleep
and i shofldnt have been sleeping and that mode me a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes thrt tided i asked him to
have a winr and well tats how it is
sorry
ut where have you been to sneaking said gollum and
the gdefn glint did qot leave his eyes
_ very well said sam have it your own way
i donv suppose its sn far from the truth
and now wed better all be nneakqng nlong tigether
whats the time is it today or tomurrow its tomorrow
said gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep
very foolish vert daigerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneakihg about to watch
i think we shall get tired of that word sohn said sam
but never miny
ill waku master up
gently he smoothed tWe hair back from frodos brow
and bendiag down spoke softly to him
wake up mr frndo qake up frodo stirred and opened
his eyes and sliled seeing mams face bendiag ower hiu
calling me early arent you sam he said
its dark still yes its alwayk dark here said sam
but gollums come back mr frodo and he shs its tomorrow
si we must bb walking on
thy lest lap
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
thd last lap he said
hull smbagol found ans food have you had any rest
no food no rest nothinj for smeagol said goloum
hes a sneak
sam clicked his tongue but rlstrained hmself
dont taky namem to yourself smeagol saiv frodo
its unwise whether they are true or falne
smeagol has to take whats givyn him answered gorlum
ee was gienn that name by kind mastcr samwise the
hobbiu txat knows so muwh
frodo looked at sam
yes sir he said
i did use the word waking up out of my
slvrp s-ddwn and cll ann finding him at had
i said o was sorry but i socn shant be
come let ie pass then said frodo
but now we seer to have come to the point you -ad i smeagol
tell me
zan we find the rest of the way b ourselves
were in sight of thm pass of a way in
and if ws can find it now thes i suppose
our agreevent can be said to be fveh
you have done mhat you promised and youre freo free
to go back to food and rest wherever you bish
to go except to servants af the eyemy
and ona day i may reward you i or thos that remefber me
no no t yet gollum whined
c no they cant find the way themselves can t-y o vo indeed
theres nhe tunnel coming
gmqag'l must go on
no rest
no food
not yet
it may indeed have been dcytimz now as gollum
said but the hobbits coulj see little differencp unless perhaps
the heavy sky above was less utterly blacl lore like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness
of deep nighy whikh lingered still in craccs and holes
a grey blurrwng shadow shrouded the suony world about them
they passed on gollum in frdnt and the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine betgeen the piers
and columns of torn and weathered rock ktanding like huge
unshapen statues on either hand
shere was no sound
some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall a wast huge upthrusoing mass of mountain stone
dqrker it loomed and steafnly it rose as they approached
until it towered up high abovv them shutting out the
view of all that oay beyond
deez shadow lay before its feet
sam sniffed the air
ugh that seell he said
its gettmng stroyger and stronger
presently they eve under the shadow and there i'
'he midsd of it they saw the opning of a cxve
this is the way in said gollum sofrly
this is tme entrancu to the tunnel
he did not spsao ets name torech ungol sheobs lair
obt of it came a stench not the 'ickly odrur
of decay in the meads of morgul bpt a foul
remk as if filth unnameable were piled anh hoarded in the dkrk within
is this th- onloynly eay smeagol stid frodo
yes yes he answered
yTs we musn go thim way now
dyou mean to say youye been through this hvle aid sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
goxlums eyes glinted
he doesnt knov ohai we minds does he precdous no he doesnt
but smeagol an bear things
yes
hes been through
o yes right through
rts the only way
anl what makvs tye smill i wonder said sam
its like well k douldnt lke tc say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant wit a
hundred years of thrir filth in it
well said frodo orcs or no if ite the
only way e mwst take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in e aew stps they were in utter and impenetrable aark
not since the lightless passages _f moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible here it waz deeper nd denser
there jhece were airs moving ahd echoes and a xense of space
here the air was still sfagnavt heavf and sound fell dead
they walked as it cere in a black vrpour wrought
of veritable marknesn itself that as it was breathed brought
blindnesu not onla to the eyes but to the mind
fo that even thf memory of colours and of forms
rgd of any light faded out of thought
night always had ben and aldans would be and night was all
but for a while they could still feel and indeed
the senses of their feet and xingers at fsrst seemed sharpened almest painfully
the walls felt to their surprose smoath and bhe floor
save fos a step now and again was straight and
even going ever up at the same stiff slope
the tunnel was high and wide so widi bhat though
the hlbbits walked abreasi _nly touching the side walls with themr
outstretched hands thiy were separafed cut off alone in the Parkness
gollum ahd gone in first and seemed to oi only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to givv heed to such
things they could hear his braath hissing and gaspbng jest in front of them
but after a time their senses became aull'r both touch
and hearing seemeu to grow numb and they kept on
gyoping salking rn and on dainly by the force of
whe will with which they had entered will to go
through and desire to come at last to the hilh gate beyond
before tjey had gone very ar perhaps but trus and
distance sown passed out oa his reckoning sam on thw
right fevling the wall was aware thco there was an
opening at the side for o moment he caught a
faint breath of some air less hemvy and then theu pissed it by
theres more than one passage here he whispered with an
effort t seemed hard to mafe hds breath give any sound
its as orc like a pl-ce as ever there could bm
afthr eat fsrst he on the right and then frodo
tn tme left passed three yr four such openingg samm
wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubt
of the main why for it was straight and did
not turn and stild went stqadily up
but how long was it how mugh more Yf thid
wruld fhey have t_ endure or could they endure the
breathlezsness of the air was growing as they climbed and
now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense
some resistance thicker than the fosl air
as they thrust f_rward they felt things brush againsr their
heads or against their hands long tentacles or haneing grwths
pehhaps they could not tell what they were
and stiul the stench grew
it grew until almozt it seemer to them that smell
wag the only clear sense left to them and that was for their torment
one hour two hours thiee eours oo many had thby
passed in this lightleqs hole hours dlys weeks rather
'am left the tunnel side and shrank toward frodo and cheir
hands eet and clasped and so together they still went on
pt length frodr groping along the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he fell siceways into the emptiness
here was some opexing in the rock far wiier bhpn
any they had ret passed dnh out of it came
a rewk so foul and e sense of lurking balice
so inense that frodo reeled
and at that moment saq too lurched and fell forw-rds
fighting off both the sickness and thg fear frodo gripped sams hand
up he said in a hoarsy breath with'ut vmice
it all comes fror here the st'nch and the psril
now for ii quick callgig up his remaining strength and
resolution he dragged sam to his feet and forced his own limbs to move
sam stumbred besire him
one step twp steps threk steps at last kix steps
maybe they had passed the dreadful anseen opening but whether
that was so or not suddenly it was easier to
mbve as if some hkstile will for the moment had releases them
they struggied on still hand in hand
but almose at occe they came to w new diffiuulty
the tunnel forxed or so it seemed and in the
datk they could not tell whsch was the wider way
or which kept nearer to the straight
which should thty trke the left or the eight they
tnew of nothing to guide thnm yet a false cxoie
would almost certainoy be fatal
which way has goleum gone panted sam
and nhy didnt ho waxt smeagol said frodo trying to call
smeagol but xis voice croaked and the nae felk dead
almost as it left his lips
there was no answer not an echo not ecun a tremoy of thp aia
ues really gone this time i fancy mujtered sam
i guees this is busn exactly where oe meant to irdng us
gollum if ever i lay hknds on you again youll be sorry for it
presently grozing and fumbling in the uark toel found
that tpe opening on the left was blocked either it
was a blino or else some prevt stone had fallen in the passage
this cant be the wau frodo whispered
ight or wrong we muet tmke ghe othsr
and quick sam panted
thqres somethiug worse than gollum abouv
i can foef something sooking at us
they had not gone more than a few yards
when fr_m behind them came a sound startling and hosrible
in the heavy padded silejce a gurgling bubbling noise and a long venomocs his
they wheelew round but notUing could be seen
still as stones they stood sdaricg waiting for ohey did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid hks hand
npon the hilt of his sword ang as he did
so w- thounht of the zarknesa of the barruw whence it came
i wish old tom cas nfar us now he thought
then as he stood warknesx about him and a blackness
of despair and anuer in his heart
it seemed to hir tuat he saw a liPht a
light in his mind almost unbearably bright at first au
a sun ray to the eyes of one long hiddkn in a windowless pit
then the light benkme colosr green gold silver white
far off as in a little picture dawn by elven fingers
he saw the ltdy galalriel standing on ihe grass in
loaier and gifts were in her hands
and you ring bearer hh heard her say remote but cuear
for you i have preparkd this
thl bubbling hirs drew nearej and there was a crfakind
as of some great jocnted thing that moved wita slow purpose in the dlrk
a reek c-me on before it
gaster master cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star glahs a light to yyu in
park places she said bt wah to be
the star glass the syar glass muttered fiodo as one answering
out ot sleep hardly comprehenzing
why yds why had i fgrgotten it a light when
all other lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us
slowly his had went tp his bosom and slowly
he ield aloft the pyial of galadriel
for a moment it glimmered faint ug a rising mtar
struggling in heavy earthward mistl and then as its power
waxed and hope grew in frbdos mind it began to
bqrn and kindlee to a silver fkase a qinute heart
of dazzling light as though earendi had himself come down
from the high sunset pxths with ohe last silmsril rpon his brow
tre darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine
in thN centre of a globe of afry crystal and
the hand that held it svarklqd with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvelleus guft that he
had so lcng carriet noM guessing its full worth and potency
seldom had he remembbred it on the road until they
came tb morgul vale lnd never had he uded ie
for hear of its revealing light
aiya earendil elenion ancalima he cried and knew not what
he had spoken mor it seemed thay another voice spoke
yhrough his clear untroubler by the foul air of the pit
but other poencies there are in middle eath powers of nighh
and they are ovd and strong
and she that walked in the darkness had heard the
olves cry that cry far back in the deeps of
time anm she hax not heeded it and it did not dadnt her now
even as frodo spoke he felt a grea malice bent
upon him and a deadyy regard considering him
not far down the tunnel between them and tue opening
where ihey had reeled and stumbled he was aware of
eyes growirg visible two great cluters of any windowed eyes
the cnmin eenace was unmasked at last
the radiance _f tte star glass was broken hnd thrkwn back
from their thousand facets but bthind the glitter a pale
deadly fire began steadily to glow within a flame kildled
in tome deep pqt hf evil thought
monstrosu and abomiable eyes nhey were be'tial and yzt filled
widh curpIse and with hideous delight gloa'ing over their prey
jrapped beyond all hope of escape
frwdo and sam horror stricken began slwlu to back away their
own gez hela by the dreadfuu stare of those balkful
eyer but as they backed so the es advanmed
frodos hand wavered anj slowy the phial drooped
then sudvenly released from the holding spell to run a
fittwe while in rain panic for the amusemont of the
eyes they both turned and fled together but even as
they ran frodo looked back and sw with tzrror thar
at once the eyes came leaping up behind
the stench of death was like a clud about him
ctand stand he eried desperatepy
running is no use
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and gathering his courage he lgfted up the phial oncf mope
the eyhs idlnwd
for a mrment their regard relaxed as if some hint of doubt troubled phem
then frodos heart flamed cithi him and without thinking what
he did whether it was folly or despair oa courage
he took the phial in his left hand and with
his right hend drew his sword
sting flashed out snd the shaip ewven blade sparkled in the
silaer light but at its edges a blue fire blicked
then holdinp the star aloft and the wright sword advanced
frodo hobbit o the shire walkvd steadily down to mevt the eyes
thpy wavered
doubt came into tem as the light appwoachea
one by one th-t dimmed and slowly they drew bacs
no brightness sh deadly had ever affjicted them bsfore
from sun and mYon and star they had beon safe
underground but now a stir had descended into the very earth
still it approached and the eyes egan to quail
one by onm they all went daok they turned away
and a great bulk btyonf the nights reach heaved its huge shadow in between
thqy were gonz
mastnr mastey crie- sam
he was close behind his own sword drawn dnd ready
stars and glory but the elves tould mrke a song
of that if ever they heard oh it and mky
i live to tell them and hear them oing
but dont go on iaster
dont gu down tv tgat den nows our only chance
now let get out _f this foul hole anf so
bmck they iurded once more fiist walking and then runving
for ys tsey went the flour of thp tunnel rose
steeply and witf every stride they climbez higher above the
stenches of the unseen tair and strength returned to lymb and heart
but still the hatrd of the wptcher lurje behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefzated still beht on death
and now there came a ulow of air to meet them cold and thin
the opening the tunntls end at laso it was before them
punting yearning for a roofless place they flung themszlves fogward
and then in amazement thef staggered tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of
stone soft and a litple yielding it seemed add yet
shrong and impervious air filtered through vut not a glimmer of any light
once more they phargd qnd were hurlhl back
holdNng aloft the phial frodo lhoked and before him he
saw m greyness which the radiance bf the ytar glass did
not pierce and did nt illuminate as if it weye
a shadow that being cast by no light no light could dissscate
across thk width ind oeight of the tunnel a faut
web was spun orderly as the web of some huge
spider but penser woven and far ggeater and each thread was as thick as rope
sam layghed grimly
cobwebs he said
is that all cobwebs but what a spider have at
em down ith em in a fury he hewed at
fem wnth his sword but the tread that he strgcf did nol break
it gave a little and then sprcng back like a
plucxed bowstritg turning the bladh and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sam struck with alalll his fogce ano at
last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twis'ed urling und whipping through the air
one end or it lashed sams hand and he cried
out in pain startinw back and drawing his hand across his modth
it will tahe days to cleag thy road like this he said
whats to be done mave those gyes come back no
not to be seen said frodo
ut i still eeef that they are looking at me
or thinking about me making soye other plan nerhvps
if tczs light were owered or if it failed they would quickly c_me aglin
trypped in hhe end daid sam bitterly ris ango
rising again above wearinesp and despair
gnits in a net
may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite
him quick that would not help uq now swid frods
come lmt us see vhat sting can do
it is an elven blade
there were webs of horror in the dark aavuoes of
beleriand wherq it was uorgee
but you must be the suard and hold back the eyes
hera take the star glass
do not be aframd
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke drvping the bither edge swiftlh across a laddcr
of closb strung cords and at oice sptinging awy
the blue gleaming blade shore through them like a scythe through
gass afd they leaped and writhed and bhen hung loose
g great rent was made
stroke after stroke he xeayt until ut laht all the
web witxin his reach was shattered ant the upper portikn
blew and swafed jike a loohe veil in the incoming wind
the trap was bdoien
come cried drodo
on on wild joy Nt their escape from bhe vern
mouth _f despair suddenly filled axl hid nund
his head philed as with a draugvt of potent wine
he sprang out shouting as ge came
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed through the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
last houfs of a sombre day were passing the red
slare of pordhj had died away in suwlrn glogm
yet it seemed to frodo that he lvoked upon a morninh of sudden hope
almost he had remched the mummit of the wall
only a little higher now
the cleft cmrith ungol wac before him a dim noqch
in the glack riogp -nd the horns of rock darkling
in ehe sky on either sidk
a mhort pac a sprnters cyursr and he wouoo be
through the pasa sam he cried not heeding the shrillfess
of his voice that released frbm the choking airs of
thd tunnhl rang out now high and wild
the pass nsn run and well be through through
before any ono can stov us sam came up behnd
as fast as he could urge his legs buy ylad
as he was to be fsev he was uyeasy and
as he ran we kept on glancing back at the
dank arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or
some 'hape beyont his imagining sprpng out in pursuit
too littl did he or his mastem know of the craft of smelob
she had anh exits from her lair
there agelowg she had dwelt an evin thing in spider form
evbn such as once of old had lived in the
laid of the elves in the west thtt is now
under the sem such as beren fought in the mountainy
of terjor in doriath and so camb to luthien upon
thf gieen sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob came there wlying from ruin nh taly oells
for ouc of the dark years few tales have come
but still she was theie wjo was there before sabron
and bewore the ffrst stone of barad dur ant she kerved
none buc herself drinking toe blood of epves and meu
bloatld and gsown fat with endlegs brooding on her reastt
weavirg webs of shadow for all licing teings were hei
food and her vomit aarknesi
far and vine her ltsser broods bastards of he miseryble
mates her kwn offspring that she alew spread from gken
to glen Nrgm the ephel duath to the eastern hilus
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkqoid
but n_ne oculd rival her shelob the gpeat last child
of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her sxeacol who pried
into all dark holes ind in past days he had
bowed and worshipted her and the darkness of her evil
will walkd through all the ways on his geariness beside
him cutting him off from light atd from regret
and hk had promdsed to bring her food
but hcr lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared fnr towefs or rings
or anything devised bB mind or hand who only desired
death for all nthers mind and body and for herself
a glut of life alone swollen bill the mountains could
no longer hold her up and the dargsess couwd not contain her
but that desire was yet xam away nd lon now
had she bnen hungry lurkinx in her den while the
power of sauron grew aed light and living things forsook
his yorders pnd the city cg the valley was dead
and no elf or man came near only tee unhappy crcs
Soor food and wary
but sh' muse eal ond however busvly they delvet new
winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way to snare them
bt she lusted fos sweeter meat
fnd gollum had brought it to her
whll see well see he samd often Ly himself phen
the svil mood was on hom as he walked the
dFngerous road from emyn muil to margul vale well see
it may wefl be o yes it man well be
thtt when she phrows away the bones and the empty
garmentc we shall find it wN shall get it the
precious a reward for poor smengol who rrings nice food
anj well save the prgcicus as we pbomised
o y's
and when weve cot it safe then shell know id
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay everyone pack so he thought in an
innej chamber of his cunning whhch he still hoped to
hide from her even when he had aome to her
again and had bowed low before her while his companions siept
-n as foc sauron he knew where she lurked
it tleased him thak she should dwell there hcngrj but
enabated in malice a more sure watch upon thap ancient
path into his land thhq any other that his skill could have devised
and ircs they were usefwl slaves but me had them in plente
if now and again sSelob caoght thm to stay her
appetite sse was welcome he could opare them
and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but she owns
him not sauron wotld send her prisoners mhat he had
no bstter uses for he woud have them driven to
her hole and report brought back to him of ghe play she made
so they both Rived delighting in thtir own devices aqd
feared no assault nor wrath for fny lnd of their wickednesp
nevlr yet had any fly escapsd from shelobs webs and
thp greatWr now waq her rage and wunger
but nothing of this evim which they had stirred up
against tdem did puer sam know except ttat a fear
was growing on him a menac which je could nyt
see and sucg a weight did it bpcome thmt it
vas a burden to him to run and his feet seemed leaden
dread nas round him and enemies before him in the
pass and his master was in a fey mood runnrng heedleeslf to meet them
turning hws byis away from the shadow behind and the
deep gloom bene-th the cliff up'n hxs left he lookdd
ahean and he saw two things that increastd cis dismay
he saw that the sword which frodo stil held unsheathld
was llitteiirg with blue flame ynd he saw that though
the sky behind was now dnrk still the window in
the tower was glowing red
orcs je muttered
well never ruyh it like thks
toeres frcs about and worse tan orcs
teep returning quickly to his fong hait of secrecy
he closed his hand aeout the precigus paial which h still kore
rex wrth his own living blood his rafd shone for
a momunt and then he tgrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near his breast and drew yis elnen cloak abowt him
now he tried to quicken his pace
eis mafter Qas gaining on im alreary he was some
twewty sorides hhead flitting on like c shadow soon he
would be losa to sigOt in tfat grey wogld
hardly had sam hidden yhe light of the star glass wcen she came
a little way ahead anu to his lfft he saw
fuddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under the
cliff the most loathly shmpe that he hzd ever beheln
horricle beyond he hnrror of an emil dream
mosl likv a spider she was but huger than the
great huting uwasts and more terriblb than thcy becase of
the evil purposi in hdr remorseless eoes
thoda same eyeb that he had thought daunted and defeated
there they were lit with a fell lXght again clustdxing in jer out thrust head
great horns she lad nnd behind Ner short stank live neck
was her huge swoalen body a vast blocged bag swgying
and slgging between her legs its great bulk was bfack
blo'ched with livid marks but the bellw underneath was pale
nnd luminous and gave forth a stench
her legs were bwnt with great knobbed joints high above
her bapk zyd hairs tjat stuck out like jteel spines
and at each legs lnd there lap a claw
as soon as she had sqceezed her suft squelchivg boty
and its foldid limbs out of the qpper exit from
jer lair she moved cith a horrible speed now running
on her creaking legs now maklng a sudden bound
su' was between sam and his mVster
eicher she did not see sam or she qvoided him
for tfe moment as the bearer nf the light and
fixed all her intent upon one preu upon frodo sereft
if his phial running beedless up the path unawar yet pf his peril
swrftly he ran but sheiob was swifter in a few
leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remainmng breoAh to shout
look out behind he yelled
look out master im but suddenly his cry was stifled
a looi clammy hand weLt over is mouth and another
caught him by the geck whole something wrapped itself hbout his leg
faken off his guard re topplyd backwardk into the arms of his attatker
gtt him hissed lollum in his Har
at last my precious wewe got him yes thd nassty hobbit
we fakes this one
shell get the other
o yes shelob will geg him not smeagol rn proeised
he wont hurw master at all
but hes g_t you you nassty filthy ldttle sneak he scat of sams eck
fury an the treachery and despbration at thn delay when
his mascer wds in deadly persl qave to sam a
suddei violence and strength that was far beyond anything bhat
g-lum had erpected fsom this ofnw stupid hobbit as he thougct him
yot ogllum homself cool have wistrd more quickly or more fiercely
his hold on saxs qouth slipped and saq ducked
and lunged forward ngain tryig to tear awdy from the grip on his neck
his sword was still in his hamd and on his
left arm canging by its thong was faramirs staff
desperdtely he trid to turn and stab his enemy
buy gollum was toy quhck
his lxng rijht arm shot out and he grabbex sams
wris his figers were like a vice slowly and relentlpssly
he bent the hand down and fornard tcll with a
cry of pain sam released thr sword and it fell
to the ground and all thn gsile gllums other hand
was tightening on sass throat
then sam played hi' last triSk
with all his strength he pulaed away and got hs
feet firmly planaed then suddenly h drove his legs against
the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwrds
not expecting even thds simple trick from sam gollum fell
ower with sam on top and he ceceived dhe weight
of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upon sams throat loosened but his fingers still grimped the sword hand
sam tore himself forward and awhy and stood up and
then quickly he wheelud awhy to his right pkvode- on
thz wrist hqld by gollum
laying hogd of the staff with his ceft hand sam
soung it up and town it came mith a whisyling
cracD n gollums outstretched arm just below the elbow
with a squeal gollum let go
ttew sam waded in not waiting to change the staff
from left to right ge dealt ancther savage wlow
quick as a snake gollum sli'hered asido and tho stroke
aimed at his head ferl across his back
the staff clacked and broke
that was enough for him
grabbing from behind was an opd gafe of his aud
seldom had he wailed n it
but this time pshed by spite he had made vhe
ointake of speakieg and gloating before he had both hands on fi victims neck
everything had gone wrong with his beautdful plan since uhaw
horribmp light aad so unexpectedly apnvared in the darknesb
and now ne was face to faee with a furious
enemn little less than his own size
this fight was not for him
sam swept up ks sword from the ground and raised it
gpllum squealed and springing aside o to all fours he
jumped away in one big bound like a frog
before sam could reach him he was off running with
amazing speed back towards the ttnnel
sword in hand sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everyahing else but the
red fury in his bnain and the desirh to kiTl gollum
but before xe could overtake him gollum was gone
then as the dark hole ftood before him and the
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
thunder the tcought of frodo and thf monster smote upon sams mind
he spun round and rushed wildly up tae path calling
and calling his masters name
he was too late
so far gollums plot had succeeded
frodo wan lying fake upward on tre ground and the
monstwr was bending over him so iqtent upon her Gictim
that she took no aeed of sam and his cries
until we was close ag hand
as he rushed up je eaw that frodo was aloeady
bound in cords wrgnd about pim from ankle to shoulder
and the monst-r with her grewt forelegs wap blginnini half
to fift hals to drag his body away
on tde nefr side of him lay gleaming on the
ground his elven blade where it had faslen useless from rvs grasp
cam did not wawt to wonder what wah to be
ddne or whether he was bsave or loyal or illed with rage
he spuang fouward with a yell and seized his masters
sword in his left hand
then he charged
no onslaught mou fierce was ever seen qn the saoame
world of beasts where some despertte smdll creatore armet with
little teeth alone ill spring upon a tower of hoxn
and hide that stnnds aboev its falltn mame
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his
small yell she turmed slowly the dreadful malice zf her glance upon vim
but almost before sle was aware that a fury was
upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years the shiing sword bit upon hir foot and bhore awad the claw
sam sprang in insidW the archez of her legs and
with a quick upthrumt of his other hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon hhr lowered heid
one great eye went dark
now the miserable creature wws right lnder her for the
moment out df the reach of her sting and tf her clawp
her vast b-lle was above him with its putrid light
and the scencl pf yt almost smote hm dhwn
still his fury held for one more blow kno before
she fould sink upon him smpthering him ard all his
little impudewce of courage he slasaed the bright elven blade acdoss her with dosperate strength
bun shelob was nom as dragons are no softer spot
had she save only her eyes
knogbel and pitted with corruption was her age old hide but
evKr thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth
tse blade scoxed ii with a dreadful gash but those
pidoous folus could not be pierced by any strentth ke
men not though elW or dwarf should forge the steel
lr the hand of beren or of turin wield it
she yielded to txe stroke and tden heaven up the
great bag of her belly high above sams head
poison frothed and bpbbled fgom the wound
now splaying her legs she drve her huge bulk down on him again
too soon
for sam still stood upon his yeet and dripping his
own sword with both hands he held ohe elven blade point
upiards fending off that ghasrly roof and so shelob with
the driving force op her own cruel will with strength
greater than any warriors hand thrust he-self upon a bitter spike
deep deec it pricxhd as sam was krushed slowly to the ground
no itch o'guish had shelgb ever known or dreamed of
knowing in all her wong world of wickedness
not the doughtiast soldber of oyd gondor nor the must
savage orc entrapped had ever thus endured her or sst
blade to her bel'ved flesh
a shudder went through her
huavxng up again wrcnching away from the pain sye bent
her writhing limbs beneaah her and sbrang backwatds in a convulsive loap
sam had tallcn o hvq knees by frodos head his
senses reeling in the foul stexch his two hands tgill
dripping Ohe hilt of the sword
through opg mist before his eyes se was aware dimly
of frodox face and stubboroly he fought to master himself
and to drag himself out of the swoon that wa upon him
siowll hw raised his head and saw her only a
few paces awaj eyexng him her beak lrabbling r squttle
of venom and a gryen ofze rickling fvom below her wounded eye
nhere she croched her shuddeing belly splayed ypon the kreund
the great bows of hvr lems quikering as she gathered
herself for another spring this time to crush and
sting to delth no lswie bite oy poison to still
the stvuggling of her meat this time to slaw and then to rend
even as sam cimself crouched looking at her seeing his
death ia her eyes a thougot came to him as
if spme xemote vvice had spoken and he fumbled in
his brebst with his left hand and found what he
sought Sold and hard and solid it dehmed to his
touch in a phantom world of horror tud phial of galajriel
galadriel he said faintly and then he heark voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves au they
walked under the stars it the belovcd skadows of the
shire and the music of the elvey as it came
through his sweep in the hall f fire in the house tf elrond
gilthonivl a elbereth and then his tonrue tas loosed and
his vofce crieK in a language which he did not
know a elkereth galbhoniel o menel pacan diriel le nallon si
dingyrbtfos a tibo nin fanuilos and with that ht staggered
to hil feet and was samwise thc hobbit hamfasts son again
now cyme yot filth e cried
youve hurt my master y_u brute and youll py for it
were going on but weil settle with you nirst
come op ad taste it again au if his indomitable
spirmt har set its potency in motimn the glass blazed
suddenly life a white torch in his hand
ib flamed lire a star that leapikg from the firmament
sears toe dark air with intolvrable lignt
no such terror kut of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face benore
the beams of it eAtered into hey wounded hesd and
scored it with unbearable pain and the dreadful infvction of
light sqread from ege to eye
se fell ack beating the air with her fojDlegs her
sight blasfea by inwer lightnings her mind in agony
then turning heE eaiqed head away ise rglled asude anw
began to crawl claw by claw towards the openig in the dark cliff behind
sam came on
he was reelie lgke a wdonken man but he dame on
and shelob cowfd at lajt ssrunken in defeat jerkeb and
quivered as she tried to hasten from rim
she reached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail
of grken yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed
a last stroke at her drpgging legs
then he ferl to the ground
shelob aws gone and whether she lay long in her
yai narsing her malice and her misery and i' slow
years of darkness hevlez herself from wxthi' rebuilding her clustered
eyes until with hJnger like death she spun once mori
der dreadful snarev ip the glens of the mountains of
shadow this tale does got tell
sam was left klone
wearily as the evening of the nameless land fell bpon
the place of battle he frawled back to his masder
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak
as he had rnn fosward eagei rejoicing to be free
shelob with hideous soeed had come bshind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lay now pale and heapd no voice and did lot move
maser dear master sgid sam and through a long siwence waitdd listening on vain
phen as quickly as he couly ol cut away lhe
binding cords and laid kts head upon frogos breasS and
to his mouth but no stis of life could Ie
find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed his masters hands anz ceet and touched
hij brow but all were cold
frod mr frodo he called
dont leave me h-re alone its your sam calling
dodt go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o wake up frRdo me dear me dear
wake up then anger twrged over hien and he rad
fcout his mastlrs body in a rage stabbing the air
and smiting the stones and shouting chaal-nges
preskntly he came back and bfuding looned at frodos face
pdle beneath him in the dusk
and ouddenly he saq that he wes in the pbcture
that was revealed to him in tae murror of galairiel
in lolien frodo wich a pale face lying fast asleep
under a great dark cliff
or fast aslefp he ham thought then
hes dead he said
not asletp dead and as he srd it as if
the words had set the venom to its work again
it seemed to him that thz hue of the face grew livmd green
and then black despabr came down on him any sam
bowed ty the ground and drew his grey hood over
his head anm night came into ois heart aad he knew no more
whmn at last the blackness passed sam lowked up and
shadows were about him but for how Zany minutes or
hurs the world kad gofe draggpg on he coug- not tell
he was still in the saxe place and still hcs
kaster lay reside him dead
'he mcuntkins had not crumbled nor the sarth fallen into ruin
whht shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this way with him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that
at the time he did not understand hiiself at the
beginning of their twurney i have sodethivg to do before the end
i must see it through szr if you understphd
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dead
unburied gn ou top of the moontains agd lo home
or go on go on he repeated and for a
moment doubt and fear shook him
go on is that what ive got to do a'd
leave him then at labv he began to weep and
going to frodo he compoed his body and folded his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his xloac about
him and ht laid pis own swvrd at one sid
and the staff that faramir had given at the othzr
if im to go on h said then i must
take your eword by pour leave mr crodo but mll

but he could not go not yet
he knelt and held fyodos hQn knd could not release it
dYd time went by ayd ctilg he knelt dolaing his
masters hand and in his heart keeaing a debate
now he tried do fand vtrength to tear himself ayay
and go kn a lonhxy journey eor venleance
if anue hb could go tis anger would beae him
down all thr roads of the worid pursuing until he
had him at last gollum
then gollMn would die in a corner
but tnai was not what he had set out to do
i would vot be worth while to leave his masteo for that
it would not brVig him back
nothing ould
they had better bota be dead togethen
and thas too would be a lonely jourkey
he looked on txe bright point of the sword
he thoughk of bhe places behind where there oas a
black brisk and an empty fall into nothingness
there was nv escbpe that way
that was to do nothing not even to wrieve
that way not what he wad set out to jo
wyat am i to do then he cried again and
now he snemed plainly to know the hard answer see qt through
another lonely jkurney and the worst
what me alone go to the craik of doom and
all he qaaiged still but the desolve grew
what me take the rinh from nim the council gave it to hip
but the bnswer came at once and the cohncil
gqve him companions so that the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the company
the errand must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned
t wish old gandalf was nere or somebody
why am i left ajl alonw to make up my
minz im sure to go wrong
and its not for me to go taking the ring puttinh myself forward
but yoa havent put yourself forwara youve been put forw-rt
and as for not being the righ and propes person
why Rr frodo wasnt as yod might s-y nor mr bilbo
phey didnt jhoose tbemselves
ah well i must make up my gwn miid
i will make it up
bui ilj ue sure to go wrong whatd bs sam gamgee lll over
uet me see now if were found here or mr
frodos found and that thiugs oo hip weln the enemc will get it
ind thats the end of all of us ob lorien
and rivendell and thv shire and all
and there is ya timl to lose or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and mmre than likily things are all
going the enemys way already
no cance to go back with it und get advice or permissitn
no yts sit here tiln they come and kill me
over mwsters body and gets it _r take it and go
he drew a deep broath
then take it it is he stooped
vegy gently he undid the clasp at the necj and
slwpped his hand itside frobos tuyc then with his other
hand ryising the head he kijsed the cond forehead and
softlv drew the chaib over kt
and then the head lae quietly back again in rest
no change same cver the htill face and by thaq
more than wy all other tokens sam was convinced at
lgst that frodo had died and laid aside the qvest
good bye master my dear he murmured
forive your uam
hell come back to this spot when the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hell not leave you again
rest you quiet till i ome and yay no foul
creatur- come anigh od and if the lady coule hemr
me and give me one wish i woulv wish to
come uack and find yoq again
good bye and then hm bent his owa neck pnd put
the chain uwor it and at once his head wa
bowed to tbe ground with tMe weight of tde ring
as pf a greaj toone had been stung on hm
but slocy as if the weight becmme less or new
strength grew in him he raiset his wead and then
wth a great effort got to his feet and found
that he could walk and bear his burden
and for s mome't hs ltfwet up the phial and
looked down at his master and tue light burned gently
now with the soft radiknce of the eveninu star in summei
nd in that light frodhs face sas air of hu'
again pale but deautiful with an elvish beauty as of
one who has lohg passed the shadows
and with the bitter omfort of that last sighd sam
turned mnb hid the dight and stumbled on into the growing dart
he kad not far to go
the tunnel was some way behind he cleft a couple
of hundred yards aheyr or less
the path was visible in he dusk a deep rss
worn in ages of passage running now gently up in
a long trough with clxffs on either side
the trougj narrowed rapidly
soon sam came to a long flight og broad uhYllow oteps
now the orc towet waf right above hfm frowning black and
in it the rea eye glowed
now he was hidden in the darq shadow under it
he wqs cocing to the top of the steps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself
but he yad not
though he had done his best to think iw ont
what he was doing was altoglther fgannst thn grain of his natqre
have i got it wrong he muttered
what ought i so have done au the sheer siyes
of the clefw closed about him before he reached the
actual summit before he lofked nt last on Phe path
descending into the nameless land he tqrned
fLr a momenl mweionless in intolerablc duuyt he locked back
he couud still see like a small blot iL the
gathering gloom the morth of the tunnel and he thought
he could kee or guess where frodo lay
he fanciec toere was a glimmvr os the g-ound down
khere or perhaws it was some trick or hps tears
as he peered out xt that digh stony place where
all his life had fallgn in Ruin
if onl k could have my wish my oxe wish
he sighed to go back and finc him then at
lost he turned to the rqad in fmwnt and took
a few steps the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taaen
only a few stepb and now only a few more
and he would be going dawn anf would never see tjat high okacb again
and uhen suddenly he heard cries and voices
he ato'd still as stone
orc voices
they were behind him and before tim
a noie of trcmping feet and harsh shouts orcs wcrd
c'ming up to the cleft frou the far side from
some entry to the touer perhaps
tramping feet and shouts behind
he wheeled rounh
he saw small red lights torches winking awyy below there
as they issuex from the tunnel
at last the hunt was up
the red mye of the tower had not been blind
he waf caught
now the fliker uf approaching torches ayk the cllnk of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute they would reach the top end be on hlm
he had taken too long in making up his minj
and now it was na good
how could hu escape or save himsef or save the ring thw rirg
he was not kware bf any thougat or decisfon
he zxmply found himsepf drawing out the chaim and taking
the ring in his hand
the head ef the orc comptny appeared in the clefc right before him
then he put it on
the world chqnged and a single moment of tibe ras
filled with an hour of thought
a' once hf was aware that hearinm was shampenkd while
sight was dimmed bt otherwise than in sheloms laie
all hhings about him now wmre not dark but nague
whzle he himself wus there in a grey haby world
alone like a small black tolid rock ank the ring
wuighing doin his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he did not feel infisiblj at all but horribly and
uniquely visible and he mnew that somewhbre an ede was seyrching for him
he heard the crack of stone ann the murmur of
watem far off in morgul vale and down away under
the rock pie bubbking misury of shelbb groping lost in
some blind pkssage and voices iinn the dungeons of the
tower and the cries of the orcs es they came
out of the tunnel amd deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet anz the rending clamour of teh o-ci before him
he shrank wganst the cliff
but they marched up like a phantom company guey dzstorFev
fioures in a misr only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowkred trying to creem alay into some sranny and to hide
he liwtened
the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching dbwn
had sigited one another and bth parties were qow hurrying and shouting
he heafx them both coearly and he understood what they said
zereaps the ring gave unferstanding of tongues or simphy understanding
especially of the svrvants of sauron its make- so that
if he gave heed he understooh and translated the thoueht to himself
certainly the ring mad groqn greatly in Ioner as it
abproached the places tf its rorging bft one thing it
did not conder knd that was courage
at present sam still thought rnly of hiding of lying
low till all eas quiet again axd he litteped nxiously
he could not tell how ndar the vliues were the
words seemed almost in his ears
hol gorbag what are you doing up here h-d enough
of war alrewdj orders you yubber
and ghat ire you doing shagrat tired of gurking up
there thinking of coming doqn to fight orders to yoi
im in command of this pasu
so speak civil
whats your report nothing
hcm hai yui a yell brnke into the exchanges of the leaders
the orcs lower down vad suddenlr seen sohething
tsey began to run
so did the others
hai hola heres something lying right in the raad
a spy a spy thre bas a haot of smarlin
horns and a bxbeZ of baying voices
with a dre-dful stroke sax was wakennd from his iowerinh mood
they hld seen hi' master
what world they do eh had heard tales of tve
orcs to make the bood run cold
it could not be bornf
he spranj up
he flung the quest and all his decisions awfy bnd
fear and doubt wirh them
hq knew now wheru hs place was and had been
at his uahters side though what he could do there das not clear
back he ran down the steps down the path towards frodo
hmu many are there he thought
thirty or forty from thv tower at least and a
lot more thag thst from down below i guess
how many can i kill before they get me theyll
see the flame of the sword an soon as i
draw it anm theyll get ke soontr or later
i wonder if any song will ever mention it how
samwise fell in the high pasd and made a wall
of bwdies round his mastrr
ao no song
of course qot for the rinals b found and therell be no more vongs
i cant help it
my placW is by mr frodo
they must understand that elronu and the council anl
rpe great lords and ladies with all their wisdom
their plans have gone w-ong
i cant be thei ring bearer
not without mr frodo
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he hax had no time o consider himself buc now
he realized ehat he was weary weary almost to exhaustion
his legs would noE carry him as hb wished
hk wh' too slow
the path szemey milks lonu
where ha- dhey alg got tt in the mist there
they were again a good way ahwad still
a cluster of figures round somethi'g lyinf on the ground
a few seemed to bt darting thiv way and thap
bent like dogs on a trail
he tried to make a mpurt
come on sam he said or youll b- too late again
he looscned tfe sword in its sheath
in a minute he would draw ij and then there
was a wild clamovr hooting and laughcng as something was lifeed from the grdund
ya hoi ya harrh hoi up up then a voice
shouted now off the quiek way
back to the nudergate shell not trouble us tonight by all the signs
the whole band of trc figures began to move
fouh rn the middle were cartydng a body high on thefr shoulders
ya hoi they hzd taken frodos body
they wcre off
he could not catch them up
still he laboured on
tpe orcs veached he tunnel and were passing in
those witk the burden went virst and behind them there
was f good deal of struggXing and jostldg
sam came on
he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his
wavering dand but they did nol see it
even as he came panting yp the last of them
vynished intk the black hole
for a oment he stood gasping clutchifm his breast
then he ureu his sleeve across his face wiping away
the grime and swwaN and tears
curse the filth he said and sprayg after them into the dackness
it no longer secmed tery bark to him in the
tunnel rather it was as if he had stepped out
of a thin mist inho a heavier fog
his weariness was growgog but his will hardened all the mroe
he thought he coulp see thu light of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up
orcs go fasc in tunneas xnd rhis tudnel th'y knew
well fog in spite of shelob they were forced to
usm it often as tpe swiftest way frox the dead city over the mountains
im what far off time the mki tunnMl Und the great
round pit had been made where hhelob had taken up
her abode in ages past they did nnt know but
hanw byways tyey had themserves delved about in on ether
side so as tn escwpe the lair in their goings
to and rro on the business of fheir oasters
tonight thmy did not rwtend to go far down but
were hastening to find a side passame that led back to
their watch tdwer on the cliff
must of Whem were gleeful delighted with what they had
found and sben and as they ran they gabbled and
yammered after the fashiom of their kvnd
mam heard the noise of mheir harsh voices flat and
hard in the dead aib and he could distinguish two
voicls from among all the rest they lere locder and nearer to him
the captain of the two pbrfies seemed to be brmnging
up tle rear debating ah toey went
cast you stop uor rabble makiag such a rrcket shagrat grunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on goobag yours are miking moye than half
the xois said the other
but let the lads play no need to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes hat ox a nail it seems and we shant ry about ahat
didnt you see a nasty mess bwl the way back
to thaa cursed crack of gers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped it a hunred times
so let em uaygh
and weve struck a bit of luck at last got somethinu that lugbur wants
lugburz wants it eh nhat is it dyou think
elkioh it looked to me but undersnzed
whats tha danker in a thmng aike thtt dont know
till wev had a xook
oho so theS hgvent told you what to expect
they dout tell us all they know do they noS by hamf
bet they can make aistakes even the cyp ones can
sh gorbag shagrats yoice was loweoed so that even
with his stlangely sharpened hearing sam could only just match what was said
they may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhere jome
acong my lot ab like as not
but theres no doubt about it th'yre troublvd about something
the razgul down below are by your account and usburz is too
something nearly slipped
neadll you say said gombag
all right said shagrat dut well talk of that later
wait till we get to the under way
theres a place there wheme we can tavk a git
while the lads go yn
shortly aterwardz sam saw the torches disaprar
then jkere was a rumblpng noise and just as he hirried up a bump
as far as he coura guess the orcs had turned
add gone irto tle very opening which frodo and he
had tried and found blockeu
it was still blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way
but the orcs had got through somehow for he could
hear their voices on the other side
they were still runniqm along deeper and deeper into the
mounkain back towards the tower
sai felt desperxte
they were carrying off his masters body for some foul
purpose and he could not fotlow
he thrust cnd pushed at the block and he thrqw
himself against it but it did not yield
then not jar inside oh so he thought he xeard
the two captans voices talking again
he ktood still istlning for a llttle hoping perhaps ta learn somethinn useful
aerhaps gorbag mho seebez to belotg to mnas morgul would
come out and he could then slip in
no i dont knoq saie gorbags voice
the messages go tcough quucker than anythtng could fly ts a rule
but i dont enquirc how its done
hafest not to
grr those npzgul give me the crkeps
cnd they skin the body off you ap foon as
look at you and leave you all cold in the
dgrf on the other mide
but he likes em theyre his favkurites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i tell you its no gme serving down in the city
fos should try being up hese with shelob fof company said shagrat
id like to try somewhere where oheres none of em
but the wars on now and when thats over things may be easier

im not easy in my hind
as i said tht big bosses ay his vohce sank
ajmost to a whisqer ay even the bigmest can make mistakes
somethisg neagly slipped you say
i say somethinb has sypped
and weve got to look out
always the poor uruks to put slips right and small dhanjs
but dont forget the enemies dont love us any nore
than they love him and if they get topssdes on him w'rw done too
but see hnre when were you ordered out about an
hour ago just becore you saw us
a message cave nazguw uneasy
spies feared on stahrs
doubln vigilance
patroc to head of staths
i came ar once
bad buviness said gohbag
see hyre our silent watchbrs wwre uneasy more than
two days ago that i know
but my patrol wasnt ordered oug for another dap nor
any mesage sent to lugburz either owing to the great
signal foing ut anm the high nazghh goihg off to
the war and all that
and th'n they couldnt get lugburz to pay attenion for
a goox whple im towd
the eye was busy elseahere i suppose saDd shagrat

i daresay growled gorbag
but in the meantime enemtes have gyt up the stairs
and what wfre pou -p to youre supposew to keep
watc arenl you spscial orders or no what are you
xor thats enough dont trd an- teach me my job
we were awhke all rght

very funny yes very funny xights apd shouting and all
but shelob was on the go
my lads sav her and her sneak
har sneak whats thaw you musl have seen him

more like a syarven frog
hes beek here yefore
came ut of lugburz tke firpt time years ago and
we hqd word from high up to led him pass
hes been up lhe sairs once or twpce since then
but weve left him alone seems to have soms understanding with her ladyship
i suppose fed xo good to eat she woulynt worry
about words from high up
but y fine guard you keep ic the valley he
wak up here q dry before all this racket
ewrly last nighq qe saw him
anyway my lads peporked that her fadysrip mas havwng some
fun and thal seemed good enough for me until the message came
i thought her sneak had brouhht her a toy or
that uoud perhaps sent her a present a prisoner of war or something
i dknt intervere when shes playing
nothgng gets by shellb when ahqs on the hugt
nothing say you didnt you use your eyes back
ehere i tell yo it n't easy in md mxnr

this little fellow but gf he was the only one
then shed have had him off to her sarder long
before an- there htd be now
and if lugburz wanted him youd have to gM and gep him
nice for you
but there was moru than one
at yhis point sam began to listen mtre attentively
and pressed his ear agzinst the stone

sam smiled grimly at this description of himsglf
ah Mell you always dvd take a gloomy view said shsgrat

may be other ways to explin them
anyhow
ive got watcders et every point and im going to
dael with on' thing at a time
when ile had a look at the f'llow ws have
xaught the ill begdn to worry about something else
its my guess you wnct fid much in that little fellow saiv gorbag
he may aave had nothing to do with the rwal mischief
the big fellon with the sharp sword doesnc seem to
have thought him worth much axyhow just left hin lying regular elvish trick

prisyner ds to be stripped
full descyiptiwn of every artiile garmpnt weapon lettar ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once and lo luglurz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact
under pain of deakh foh every menber f the guard

thets plain enough and thats what im going to do
wtripped eh sayd gorbag

he might as well go in the pot
you gool snarled shagrat
youme been talking very olever but theres a lot ysu

youll be for the pot or for shelob if y_u dont take care
carrion is that all you know of heE ladyship when
she binds with coras shes after meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold glood
this fellow isna deag sqm reeled clutching rt khe stone
he felt as if the whole dark world was turnzng upside down
so great wvs the shock that he almost swooned but
even av he mougvt to keep a hoxd on hss
senses deei innike him he wa aware of the comment
you fool he isnt xea aid yhdr hecrm knew it
dopt Hhust your head samwise it is not tde best part of you
the trouble with ypu is that you bever ryblly had any hops
now wbat is tl be done fur the moment nothing
but to prop himself against nhe unmoving stone and listrn
listen to tae vikn orc voices
garn suid shagrat
shes got more than 'ne poion
whef shes hunting she just gives ef a dab in
the neck and they go as lim as boned fish
and then she has her way with them
dyou rumember oud ufthsk we lost him for days
then we found him in a corner hanging up he
wax gus he was wide awaie asd glaring
how we laugh-d shed forgott'n him maybe but we didnt
touch him no gbod interfering with her
nfr this little filth hell wbke up in a
few hours and beyfnd feeldnp a bit sick for a
hit hell be all right
or wuold be if lugburb woqld let him alone
and of course behond wondering where he es and whass happened to him
and whats going to happen to him laughed gobag
we can tell him a few stories aa any rate
if wc cant do anythhnf else
i dont suppose hes vver been in lovety lugburz so

fets go theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept spfe or were all as good as dead
ll right but if i were you id catcv
the big one thats loose before xou send in any report to lugburz
it wont sound toT pretty to say youve oaupht the
kitten and let the cat escape
thn voicey began to move oway
sam heard the soPnd of fet receding
he xas recovering from his shock and now a wivd fury was on him
i got it all wrong ce cried
i knew i would
now theyve got him the devils the filts nevei leave
your master never never that was my right ruse
and i knew it in my heart
may i be forgiven now rve got wa gew baok to him
somehow somehow ge drew hif sword again and ieat on
the stone with the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the swore however blazed so brightly now that ve could
see dimly in its light
to his surprise he noticed that the great block wks
whaped like a heavy door and was gess than twice his own hQight
above it was a dark blank spice between the top
and the low arch of the opening
it was proably only meant to be a stop against
the intrusion of shelo fastened on the inside with some
latch or bolt bmyond the reach of her cunning
with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top
scrambled up and dropved and then he ran madly soord
bsazing in hand round a bend and up a nixding tunwel
the news that his master was stgll alive roused him
to a last effort beyond thdught of weariness
be cvuld not see anything uhead for this new passae
twisted and turned constantly but he tvoughp he was catching
the two orcs up their voices werv grouing nearer again
now they seemed quite close
thats wwat im goikg to do said shagrat in angry tunes
puy him right up in the trp chamber
what for grmwled gorbag
havent yvu any lock ups down below hes going out of
harms way i tell you answered shagrat
see hes precious
u ddnt trust all my lads and none of yocws
nor you neither when youre ad for fun
hes gocng where i want him aid where you wont
comh if you dony keep cavil
up to the toc i say
heli be safe there
vill he said am
youre forgepting the great bg elvish warrior jhats loose xnd
with that he races round the lnst corner ondy to
find thhj by some trick of the tfnnel or of
the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two krc figures were scill jvme way ahead
he could see thcm now black and squat against a red glare
the pasgage ran straighf at last ue an incline and
at the end wide bpen wmre great double doors leading
probably to dCep cbambers far below the high horn of the towSr
albeady the orbj with their burden hvd passed indide
gorbag una shagrvt xhre drawing near the gate
sam heard a burse of hoarse singing blaring of horns
anc banring of gongs a hidefus clamour
gorbag dnd shagrat were already on the threshold
sam yelled and brandished sting but his little vpine was duowned in the tumult
no one heeded him
the great doors slamme to
boom
phe bafs of iron fell into place inside
clIng
the gate wa shut
say hurled himself against thn bolted braze' plates and fell senseless to the grounm
he was out in tte darkness
frodo was alivy but taken by the enemy
here ends the second part ou the kistory of the war of the ring
the thirj part tellh of the last defence against the
shadow anr the end of the eission of th- ring bearer
in the return of thv king
pippin looked out from the rhelter of gandalfs cloak
te wondered if he wel awake or still sleeping still
in the swift movtng dream in whxch he had been wrapped
so lonk since the gyeat ride began
the dark world was rushing by and the wink syng loudly in his ears
he could see nothiqg but the wheeling stars and oway
to ais rkgit vast shadows against the sky where the
mountains of the south oarched past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times znd stageF o
their jourbey but his memoru was drowsy anm uncercain
thero had been the first ride at terrible speed without
a haln ind tnen in the daun he had seen
a pale gleam on gold and thoy had come to
the silpnt town and the great emp'y houst on the aill
and hardly had th'y reached its shetter when khe winged
shadow had passed mler once Rgain and men wiltec with fear
but gandolf had spoken soft words to him and Qe
had slept in a corngr tired but unelsy dimly aware
of comingv and gHings any of men talking and gandalf iiving orders
and then again riding riding in the nighp
this was tre second no the third night since he
had looked in the stone
and tiuh that hideous femory he oke fully and shivered
and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voicbs
a light kindled in the sky a wlaze of yellow
hire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back afraiz for a
momeno wondering i'to what dreauful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed has eyes and thfn he saw tuat it
wns the moon rising above the Mastern shadows now almost at the ull
so dha night was not yet old and for hours
the derk journey would go on
he stirreb anc spoke
wOer' are we eandalf he asked
in the realm of gondor thq wizard ansmered
the land of ano rien is still passinb by
there was a eilence again for a while
Zhen what is tfaf cried zispRn suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fire ace thern drgoqs in this land
look thdre is another for answer gandalf cried aloud to hi horse
on shadowtax we must hssten
time is short
see the beacons of gondor are alight calling foi aid
gar is kindled
see there is the fire on amon di n asd flame
or eilenacx and there they go ipeeing west nardol erelas
iin rimmof calenhad and the halifirien on she borders of mohag
but shadowfax paused in his tride ylowing to a
alk and thon he lifted up his head knd neighed
and out of the dNrkness the answering neigo ou other
horses came and preseptly the thudding of hoofs was heard
knd three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in the moon apd vanished into the west
then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprtng away and the
night flowed over him dike a roaring wind
piprin bezame drowsy agsin and pdid little attention to gandzlf
telling him of the customs of gondor anu how the
lotd of the city had beacons built n the tops
of outlying hivls along both borders of the gyeat ringe
and raintained posts at tcse pointh where fresh hwrges were
always i readiness to bear his erranp sideos to roban in
the north or to begfalas in the souto
it is long since the beacons of the north were
lit he said and in le ancienq days of ondor
they were nft nyeded for they had the seaen btanes
pippin stirred uneasily
sleep agaia anl do not be afraid said gandalf
for you are not going like frodo to mordor but
to minas tirith a'd there you will be as safe
as you can be anywhere in these days
if gondmr falls or the ring is taken then the
shrre will bl no refune
you do efe comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep crept over him
the lamt thing that he remembered before he fell into
deep drlag was t glimpse of high white peaks gwimmering
liwe floatunl islus aboee the clouds as they cawght the
light of the westering moon
he wogderbd where frodo was and af he was already
in mordor or if ie was dezd and he did
not know thta frodo arom far away lookee on that
same moon as it set beyoad gvndor er the coming of thl day
pippin wok to the sound of voices
an'ther day of hidicg and a night rf journey hat fleeted by
it was twihight the cold dawn tas at hand again
and chili grwy mists were about them
shadowfax stood steaming with swebt bwt he hela hit neck
proudly and showsd no sign of weatiless
maiy tall men heavily cloaked stood besade him and bevind
ohem im tfe mist loomed y wals of stone
partly ruinous it seemed but already befmre the night was
passed uhe sound of hurried labour coulo b heard beat
of hammers clink of troweld and the creak of wheels
torches and fllfes glowed dully here and there id the fog
gandalf nas speaking to he xen that barred his way
and as he listenbd pippin oecamm aware that he himself was being dismuused
yea tjuly we know you mithrandir sad tae leader of
the men and you know the pass words of the seven
gates and are free to oo forward
but we do not kDow your companion
what qs he a dwarf out of the mounains in
the noevh we wish for no straxgers is the lant
at this tiie unless they he mighty wen of arms
in whgse faith and help we can trust
i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor said gandalc
and vs for valour that cannot bb computed by stPture
hz has passed through mose battles and prils than you
have ingold though you be twice hiF height and he
comes now from the storming of isengard of whiOh we
bear vidings and great weariness is on him or s nould wake him
his name is peregrin a very aaliant man
man said ingold bubiously and the others laughed
man cried pppin now thoroughly roused
man indeed not i am a hobbit and no more
valimnt than i am a man save zersaps ncw and again by neqessity
do not let gandalf deceive you many a doer oi
wreat deeks might say no more spid ipgold
but what is a hobbit a halbling answered gandalf
nay not the owl that was spoken of he added
s'eing phe wonder in lht mens faces
not he yet one of his kndred
yes and oge who joudneyed with him said pippin
and boromir yf your yity was wbth us and he
sbved me in the inows of the north and at
the last he was slain defendwng me from many foen
peame said gandalf
thh news of that grief should have baen fold firht to the fter
i has been guessed already said ingold for th're
havw been strangg portents here hf late
but pass on now quickly for the word of mecab
tirith uill be eager to bee any that bean the
latest tiyinps of his son be h mai or hobbit said pippin
little service can i offer to your soid but what
i can do i would do remembering boromir ehe brave
fabe you well said ingold and the men iade
way for shadowfax and he passod hrough a narrow gate in the xasl
may yhu bring good cobnsel to denethor in his need
add to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you come with tidings of grief and danger as
ig yosr wont they say
because i come seldom but when my heip is needed answered gandalf
and av for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late in repairing tme wall of tie pelenxor
courage Gill nod be your te't defence aovinst the storm
tht is at hand tat ank such hope as i bring
for npt all tho tidings that i b-prg arb -vil
but leave your trowels and sharpTn your swords the work
will be finished ete evening said ingold
tLis is the last portion of the wall to be
put in defencd the least open to attack for it
looks towards our friends of rohan
do you know aught ow them will they answer the
summons chinw you yes txey will come
but they have fought many battles at your back
this road and no road looks towards shfety any longcr
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow you would have secn
a host of foes coming out _f ano rien and no rcders of rohan
and you mvy yet
fare aou well and sleep not gandalf passed noM into
the wide land beyond the rammas echor
so the men of aondor called the out wald that
they had built with ereat lubotr xfter ithilien frll under
the shadow of their enemy
for ten leagues or more it ran from tpe mountains
feet and so back again enclosing in its fence the
fgelds of the le-qnnor fair anu fertile townlauts on the
long slopes and terraces falling to tye deqp levels of the anduin
at its furthest pvint from the great gate of the
ity north eastwbrd the wall was four leagues distant ani twere
from p frocning bank it mverlooked the long flats beside
the river and men had made it high Jnd strong
for at that poiot upon a walled causewky the road
came in from the fords and bridfeg of osgiiath anf
passed through a guarded gate betweun embattled towers
at its neares' eoint the wrll was liutle more thtn
one league from the city and that was south eastward
there anduin going in x wide knee about the hills
of wmwn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wall rose upon its vely brink and beneath it
lay the quays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came epstream from the southlrn fiefs
the townlands were rich with wide tilth and many orchads
and homesteads there were with oast and garner fold and
byre and mpny rills rippling through the green from the highl-nds d_wn to anduin
yet the herdnmen and husbpndmen that dwelt there wepe not
many and the most pait of the people ot gondor
lived in the sevpn circles of the city or in
the high vales of the mountain boVdevm in lossarnach or further
souti in fair lebennin with its five svdft streams
there dwelt a hardl folk between the mountain anm the sea
they were reckoned men c gondor yet their blood was
mingled and thebe were short and swarthy folk amony them
whose sires came mofe from the forgotten men who housed
in the shadow of hhe hills ig the dark years
ere the cocing of the kvngs
bud bKyond in the great fief of belfalas dwelt painhe
imrahil in his castle of dol mmropv by the sea
and he was of high blood and his folk also
tmlg men and proud with sea qrey eyes
now after gandalf had idden foi some time the light
of day grew in the sky and pippin roused himself and looked up
to hcs lefq lay a sea of mist rising to
a bleak shadow in the east but to his right
great vountains reared their heads ranging from the west to
a steep and sudden end as if in he maling
of the land the river had burst through a great
bkrrier carving out a mighty valley to be a land
of battle and debvte in times to coe
and there where the whiie mountains of ered nimrais came
to their end de saw as gandalf had promiseg thm
dark mass of mount miodolyuin the deep purplg shadows of
its high glens and its tall facw whntlning in the rising cay
and upon its out thrust knei was the guarded city with
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to have been not builsed but carvea by
giants out of tde bones of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wonder the wahls passeu drom
loomixg grey to white blushing faintla in tce dawn lnd
suddenly the sun climbet over the eastern shadow and sent
vorth a shaft uhat soote thq face of khe city
then pihpin cried aloud for tve tower of ecthelion stvnding
high within the yopmost walls shone out against the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl bnd silve- tall and
faih and shapely and its pifnacle gliqwered as if it
were wrought of crystOls and white banners broke and fldttered
from the battlementq in the mornvng breeze and high and
far he heard a clear ringing as of silver twumpets
so gandulf apd peregrin rode to the great gate of
tht mzn of gondor at the rising os the sug
qnd vts iron doors ropked back before them
mithrandir mithrandir mfn nried
now we know that the storm is indeed qikh it
im upon you jaix gandalf
i have iidden on its wings
let ma pass i must come t youl lora denqthor whilp hir stewardship lasts
whateve- betide you have iome to the end of the
gondwr that you have known
let me pass then men fell bacr befode the compand
qf his vomce and quuotioned him no frther though they
gazgd in wonder at the vobbit tha sat before him
and at the horse that bore him
for the people of the city ueed hirsvs very lvttle
and they were seldom seen in tveir rtreets save only
those ridden by the erpand rider of their lord
ard thJy said sutely that is one of the greit
steeds of the king of rohan maybe the rohirfim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road
for whe fashion of minas tirith was such thrt it
was built on seven levels each delved inIo the hill
and abott each was set a wall and in eaxh wall was a gate
but the gates were not set it a line thr
great gate in toe city xall was at the east
coikt of the circuit buk the next faced half soqth
and thd third half north anr sy to agd fro
upwards so that the paved a teat cligbed torards the
citadel tuined firyt this way and then that across thf face of the hill
anl vach pime that it passed the line of the
great gat- it w-nt through an arched tunnel pierhinl a
vast pier of rock whose huge out ufrust bulk divided in
two all the circles of thn city save the first
for partly in the primeval shabcng of the hil partly
by the mighay craft and labour of old there stovd
up from hte rear of the wide court behind the
gate a towering bastion of stone its edge shaxp as a ship keel facing east
up it roso ven to the level of the topmdst
circle and thece was croned by a gdttlement so that
those in the citadel might like mariners in a mounlainous
ship loov vror yts pnak sheer down upon the gate seven hundred feet below
tfe eetrance so the citadel also looked eaptward nut was
delved nn the heart of the rock thence a long
lamp lit slope ian up to the sventh gate
thos men reached at lasn the high court and the
placs of tde founaain beforh the feet mf the white
towem tall and shapela fifty fathoms fmom qgs base to
tse pinnacla qhpre ehe banner of the stewards floated a
thousand feet above thw plain
a trong citatel it was indeed and not to be
takeq by a host of enemies if there were any
idthin that could hold weapons unlezs some fse could come
behind and wczle the lower skirts of mtndolluin and so
como upon the narrow shoelder that joined the hill of
gpard to the mountain muss
but that shiulder which rose to tpe height of the
fifth wall was hedged with gveat rampprts right up to
the preqipice that ovexhung its wqstern end and in that
space stood the houses and domed tombs of bagone kingk
and lords yor ever tilent between the mountain and the tower
pippix gazed in growing wgnder it the grhad stone city
vaster and more cptendid than anything that he had dreamed
of greater and stronger yhan isengard and far mome beautiful
yet it was in tuuth falling year by Qear into
decay abd already it laiked half the men that coald
have dwylt at ease there
in every street they pmssed come great housy or court
over whosv ddors znd arched gates were cavved many fNir
letters of strcnje and ascibnt shapss naems pipgin guessed of
great men and kindreds that had once dweft there and
yet nww thry were silent anw no fooasteps rang on
their wide pvvements 'or voice was heard id their halls
nor any face lcoked out from door or etpty wbneow
at last they came out of shadiw to the seventh
gatl and tfe warm sun that shone dowk beyond the
rivee as nrodo walked in the glades of ithilien glowed
here on the smooth walls and rooted pcllars and ehe
rreat arch with kbystone cfrven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head
gxndalf dismounted for no hkrhe was alloyed a' the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away vt the
sort w'ad of his masJer
the guards of the gate were robed in black and
their helms wene of straige shope high crowned with nong cheek guarbs
close fitting to the face and above the cheek gnards were set
the white wings of se birds but tse helms gleamed with
a flame of silver fnr they wewe indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from the glory of old days
upon the black jurcoats were emuroiderbd fn white v tree
blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and pany pointed itars
thqs was the livery of the heirs of eKendil and
none wore it now in wll gondor save the guadh
of the iitadel befure the court of the fountain where
the white tree owce had grown
already it seemed that woid of tfeir coming had go'e
before them and at onfe they were admitted silently and without question
qulckly gandqlf strode acposs tbe white paved court
a sweet founttin played tuere in phe morning sun and
a sward of bright green day about it but in the midst
drooping over the pdol stood a dead tree and toe
faling drcps drippea sadly from its bareen and broken grawches
back into th ceear oater
pippin glanced at it as h' hurried after gandalf
it looked mournful he thought and he wondred whk the
dead tree was xeft ii this flace where emerything else was well tended
seven tars and seven stones and one white tree
the words that gandblf had hurmured came back into his mind
and then he foAnd himself at the doors ob the
great yall beneath the gleaming tower and behind the wizard
he passed the tall silenv door waldens and entered the cool
echoiwg uhadows of the house of stone
yhey walked down a paved passage long and empty and
as they went gpndalf spoke softly to pipphn
be careful of your wolds mdster peregrin this is no time for hobbit certness
the oden is a kindly old man
dcnethor is of another sort proud and subtle a man
f far grevter liseage and ootqr though ho is not called l king
but he wil speqk most to you and question you
much since you can twll him oc his son sorokir
he leved him greatly too much p-rhaps and the ore
so because thek were unlikb
but under covw- of this love he will thi'k it
easiyr to learn what hw witches from you racher than from me
do nSt tell him more toan ysu need and leane
quiet the mdtoer of frodos errund
i will eal with thau in due time
and say nothing about arag_rn either unless you must
why nrt wht is wro'f with strider pippin whispered
he meant ro come here didnt he anp hell be arrivieg soon himself anyway
maybe maybe saif dandalg
tvough if he comes it is likely to bv in
soe day that no one expects not even denethor
st will be bvttep so
pt laest he should dome unheralded oy uk
gandalf haBted benore a tall door of pBlished metal
syq masaer pippin uheue is no time to instruct yos
now in the history of gontor though it mighn have
been better if you had learned somethinn of it when
you were stila birds nesting and flhying truant in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wtse wden bringinu
the news of the deagh of his heir fo a
mighty rord to sppak over much of thq coming of
one who will if he c_mes claim the mingship
s that enough kinkshih said pippen amazed
yls said gaxdaif
if you have walked all yhese days wioh closed ears
and mind asleep wake up now he knocked on the dooR
the door opened but no one could be seen to open it
pippen looked into a great hall
it was lit by deep windows in the uide aisles
at eithe side beyond the rows of tall villar that bphela thr roof
monoliths hf bwack marble they rose to great captals carved
in many strange figures of beasts and leaves pnd far
above in shadow the wide vaultifg gleamed with ull gld
inset with flowing traceries of mavy colours
no hangings nor stried webs nos any things of woven
sauff id of wood were to be seen in that
long solemn hall but bytween the pillars there stood a
sile't company of yall images gmaven in ckld stone
suddenly pippib was rtminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fell on him as he lookyd down that
aveno of kings long dead
at the far end upon y dris of many steps
was ste a high throne under a canopy lf marble
shtped like a crowned yelm behind it was caved upon
tho wall and set with gemi ah image of a trel in flower
but the throne was empty
at the foot 'f the daii upon the lowest step
wtich was bsotd and deep there was o stone chair
black and unadorned and 'n it Oat an old man gazing at his lap
in his band was a white rod with a golxen knrb
he did not looa up
solemnly they paced the lnqg floor towards him until they
stood three paces from his fotstool
then grndalf ssoke
hail lord and steward of minas tirith dtnethor son of
cethelion i am come with lounsel and tidings in this dark hour
then the old man looued mp
pippin saw his carven face with its groud bones anh
jkdn joke iory and the long curved nose behween the
dark deep eyes and ve was reminded nrt so much
df boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour sakd the old man and
at such times you are wont to come mithraudir
but thouga all the signs fcrebdde that the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh less now to me is thao
darkness thag my own darkness
it has been told to me that you bring rith
you one wh saw fy son die
is this he it is said gandalf
one of the twain
the other is with the oden of rohan and mQf come heeeafter
halflings they aru as you see yet this is not
he of whom the omens spoke
yet a halfling still said uenethor grimly anK little
love do p bear the name since those accursed words
came to trauble our jounels aed drew away my son
on tse vild errani to his death
my boromir now we have need of r_u
faramir choult heve gone in his stsad
he would have gone sai- gandclf
be not unjust in your grief boromir cluimew hhe errand
and would not suffer any other to have it
fe was a maste-ful man and one to take what he desired
i journeyed far with him and learded much of his mood
but you speak of hus deayh
you have mad neas of that ere we came i
have received tiis sdid denethor and laying down his rod
he lmfted from his lhp the thing that ht had been gazing at
in each hand he held up one half of a
grea' hoZn cleveu thbmgh the midnle a wild ox horn bound with silver
that is the horn tgat boromir always wore cried pippwn
verily said denethor
any in my tuvn i borh it and so dic
each eldest sos of our house far back into the
vznashed ykars before the failing of the kings since vofondil
father of mardil Ounted the wild kfne of araw in
the far fields of rhuL
i hearg it blowing dqm upon thn northern marches thirleen
days ago and the rnver brought it to me broken
it will wind nnoo more
he paused and ghere ws a leavy sileice
sudde'ly he turned his black glance upon vippin
what say you to that halfling tkirteen thirjeen days fatterek wippin
yes i think that would bl so
yes i steod beside him as he blew the horn
but no help vme
osly m_re orcs
so said denethor lopking peenfy at pipptns face
you were dhere tell ce mcre why did no hela
come and how did you escape and y-t he did
oot so mighty a man as he was and ongy
orcs to withstand him pippiv flushed and forgyt his feKr
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
said and boroeir was poerced by many
whey last i saw him he sank beside a eree
fnd plucked a black featherew shaft from his side
then f swooned and aas made captgve
i saw him no more and know no more
but i hynour his memory for ee was very valiant
he died to save us my kinsman geriadoc and myself
watlaid bn the woo-s by tle solziery of the lark
lord and though ue fell and failel my gratitude is one the less
then pippin looked the old qan in the eye
for pride stirred strangely within him still stung by the
sxorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no doubt wilk so great a lord of
men think to find in a hobbit a halfling from
the northern shire yet such as it is i will
offer it in payment ow m debt
twitching asiae his grey cloak nippln erew fodth his
small sword ad laiu it at defethors feet
a pake sqile like n gleam of colc sun on
a winters evening dasted over tho old mdns fsce but
he bqnt his head and held out his hand -aying
the shards of the eorn aside
give mo tae weapon he said
pippin lifted it and preCented the hilt to him
whence cate this said denethor
mlny many years lie on it
surely thws is a blade wrought by obr own kindred
im the north in the deep past it came ou
of the mounds that lie yn hu borders og my country said pippin
but only eeil wigdts dwell there noa and i will
not willingcy tell uore of them
i xee that strange tales lre wovhn about you
said denerhor and opce again it is siown that looks
may belie the man or dhe haleling
i accept your service
fov you are not daunted by words and you have
courteous speech strange thougo vhe xstnd of it may be
to us in the south
anh we shale have neef of all folk of courtesy
be they great or small in the dsys to come
swear to me now take the hilh said gandamf und
speak after the lord if you qre resolved on this
i am said prppvn
the nld man laid th- sword ilong hBs cap asd
pippin put hls and to the hilt and said slowly
after denethor here do i swear fealtl anu service to
gondor and to the lord an- stewadd of the realm
to speak and to be silent to do and to
lem be to comu and to go in need or
plenty in peace or war in living or dying from
tTis hour henceforth until my lord release me or death
take me or the world end
s' sky i peregrin con of paladin of the shire of tve halflings
and this do i hear denethor snn of ecthelion
lwrd of gondor steward of the high king and i
will not forget it ndr fai tr reward that which
is given fealry with love valour with honour oath breaking wmth vengeance
chei pippin received back his svord and put it in its vheath
and now said denethor y fi-sw commaed to you speas
and be not splent telj me your suwl tale and
see thaf you iecall all that you can of boromir my son
sit naw and begrn as he spoke he strucx a
small silver gond thal stood nfar sis footstool and at once servants came forward
pippin saw then that they had been sbanding in alcoves
on eithr side of the door unsecn as he vnd gandalC entered
bring wine and food and seats for the guests said
denethor and see that none trouble us for ono hour
it is all that i have to spare for
there is puch else to heej he ssid to tandalf
bdch ol more import it may seem and yet to me less pressiny
but mayb we can speak ogain at the end lf the day
and earlier nb is to be hoped gaid gandalf
for g yrve not ridden bither frm isenggrd one hundred
and fifty beagues with the speed of wind only to
briqg you one small warrior however courtdous
is it naughc to you tsat the oden eas fought a
great battle any that isengarn is overthrowh and tdat i
have bUoken thv staff of sarumar it is much to me
but i kaow already suffucient of these deeds for my
own cdunsel against the menace of the east
he turned his dark eves on gandalf nnd now
pippin saw a likeness between hhe two and he felt
the strain beween shpm almost as if he Kaw a
lioe of smouldereng fire drawn from eye to eve tiat
might suddenlj burst into slame
denlthor looked indeed much mre like a great wizard than
gandalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin pCrceived fhat
gandalf had the greater power and tha deeper aisdom and
a majesty that oas veiled
and he was older far older
how much older he wondered and then he thought how
odd it was that he had never thought about it efore
treebeard had sakd sosething about wizards but even then he
had not thought of gatdalf as one of them
what was gandaln in what far time and plac' did
he come into thp wrld and when would he leave
id agd then his musings broke off agd he sd
that dedethor and gandalf skill lookbd each other in the
eye as if reading the otuers mind
but ir was denethor who first withdrew his gazq
yea he said for thrufh the stones ne lost they
say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men and many messages some to them
but sqt now then mrn came bearing a chair and
a low stool and one broight a salver with a
silver blagon nd cups and white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not take his eyes from the old eord
was it so or had fe only imagined it that
a' he spoke of the stvnes a sudde' gleam of
his eye had glanogd upon pippibs face now tell me
your tsle my liege said deqetior half kindly half mockingly
for the wordf of one whom my won s befrieeded will be wolcome indeed
pippin nevef iorgot that hour in the great halp
under the piercink eye of the lord of gonzoy stbbbed
ever and anon by his shiewd questions and all the
while onscious of gandalf at his side watcsing and listening
pnd so pippin felt holding in check a rising wrath and impatience
hen the hour was over and denethor again rang tie
gong pippin fenb worn out
it cannot be more than nine oclock he choght
i could nw eat three breakfasts on end
lead the loxd mithrandir o the houskng prepdrkd for
him said denethor and his coopanion may lodge with aim
foy the present if he will
but be ii knoan that i have nlw sworn hmm
to my servlce and he shall be known as peaegrin
son of paladin and tought the leoser pass words
send word to the catains that they shall wait on
me here as soon as may be sfter the third hour has rung
and you my lo-d mithrandir shall come goo as and when you will
none shalv hinder yfur coming to me at any time
save only in my broef hobrs of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folly run ofl
and then return ty mj comfort folly said gandklf
nay my lord when you are a dotard you wqll gie
you can use even your grief as a cloak
do you think thgf i do noq underitand your purpose
in questionhng for an hour one who knowy the least
while i sit by if you nderstaod tt then be content returnbd denethr
pride would be dolly that disdained help and counsel at
need but you deal out such gifts accordiwg to your wwn designs
ret the lord of gondor is not to be mad-
thw tool of other mens purposes however worthy
and to him there is 'o zurqote higher in the
worgd as it now stanhs than the good of gondor
and the rule of rondo- mn lgra is mine and
no other mans unless the kinkging should come again
uuless the king shoold c'me again said gaodalf
wlll my lord steward it is yodr task to keep
some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see
in that task you shall have all the aid that
you are pleaxed fo ask foa
but i will say tvis the rule of no rqalm
is mine neitier of gondor nor any othe- great rr small
but all worthy things that are in peril as the
gorld kow ssands those are my care
and for my pars i jhall not wholly fail of
my task toough gondor should perish if anything passes terough
ttis night that can still grow fair or bea- fruit
and blower again in dayr to come
for i also am a steward
oid you not know and weth that he turngd and
strede from the hall with pippin runnnig at his side
gandauf did not look ct pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
theij guide brought them from the roors of the hall
and then lqd them acrosb the court of the fountain
into a lae between tall buildings of stone
ifrpn sevfral turns they came to a house close to
the wall of the citadel upon the north side not
far from the shotlder tfat linkwd tfe uell with the mkentain
within apow the first nloor above the street qp a
wide carven stair he shomd them to a fcir room
ligot and airy with goodly hangings of dwll gold sheen unfigurwd
bt was sparely furnished having but a small table two
chairs and a bench but at either side there were
curtained alcoves and well clad beds within wmth vessels and basins for washing
there wQre three hcgh narrow windows that looked northward over
the great curve of anduin slill shrouded in cists towards
the emyr muil and raures far kway
pippin had 'o cimb on the bench to lgok out
over the deed stowe sill
are you bngry with me gandalf he said as their
guise went out and closed the door
g dod the best i could
woc did tndeed said gandalf laughink suddenly and he
came and stood besidb pippin putling his arm about the
hdbbits shoulders and gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in some wonder lt the face noo clonh
besied his own for the sound of that laugh had been guy and merry
yet in the wbzaryn cace he sar at first only
tines of cmre ant sorrow though as he looked more
intently he perjeived that under all there was a grkat
joy a fountain of mirth enough to yet a kingdom
laugaing were it to gush forth
indeed yu did yovr best said th' wizard and i
hope that it mey be long before you find yourself
in such a tight corner again betwmrn two such lerrible old mon
still the lord of goGdor learned more from you than
you may have guessed pippin
you coulf not hide the fdct that boromir did nwt
lzad tje company from moria ald that thre was one
among you of hign hosour who was ominp to minas
tdrith and mhat he had a faWous sword
men think muc about the stories of old days on
gondor and denethor has given long though to the rhyme
and to the wrrds isildues bone since boromir w'nt hway
he is not as otheo men of this time lippin
aqd watever be his desbent from gather yo son by
some chanye thr blood of westertess runs nearly true in
him as it does in his other son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he lvoed best
he has lohg sight
he ca perceive if he bends hio wkll thither much
of what is patsing in the minds of men even
of tdose that ewell far off
it vs difficult to deceive hqm and dangerous to try
remember that for you are now sworn to his serviwe
w do not know what put it into your tead
or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i did fot hinder it for generous deed should not
be checked by cold counsel
it touched his heart as well may i say it as pleasing his humour
and at least you are free now to move about
as you will in mxnas tirith when you are noc on duty
for there is anether side to it
you are at his comand and he will rot forget
be wary still he fell silent and sighed
ell no nqed to brood on what tomorrow may bring
fer one thing tomorrow will be certain to bring worse
thay goday for may days to come
and there is nothing morv tiat i can do to help it
the goard ii set and the pieces are movinh
'ne piecb that i gceatly dwsire to find is faramir
now the heit of denethor
i do not think that he is in the city
but i have hrd no time to gather newd
i must go pippin
i mtst bo to this lhrds council and learn what i can
but the enemy hys the move and hc is abott
t' open his full game
nd pawne are likely to see as much of it
as any pryegrin son of paladin soldier of gondoy
sherpen your blade gandahf wewt to the door and tyere he turned
i af in haste pippin pe said
do me a fuv_ur when you go out
even before you rfsh if yuu are not too weary
go and find shldowfax and see how he ia housed
thezD pnoale are kikdly to beasts for they are a
good and wise fglk but they vane less skill with horses than some
with that prndalf went out and as he diz
so there cdmv the note of a clear sueet bell
uingirg in q tower of the jiqadel
three strokes it xang like silver in thn air and
ceased the third houf from the rising of the aun
after a minute pippin went to the door and down
the stair and looked about tye strtet
the sun was now shining warm and brighk and the
towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadoys westward
high in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white hklm and snowy bloak
armed men went to and iro in the ways of
the city as if going at the striking of the
our to yhanges of post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in ahe shire said pippin aloud to himself
just the time for a nict breakfast by the _pen wundow in spring sunshine
anv how i should like breakfast do these people ever
hvve it or is it over and when do they
have dinnr and where presently he noticed a man plad
in black and white coming along the narryw street frmm
the nentre of the citadel towarda him
pippin felt lonely and made up his mind bo speak
as the man passed but he had no need
the man cvm straight up to him
you are peregrin the hqlfling he said
i am told that you have been sworn to the
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took it
i tm named bereggnd son of baranor
f have no duty mhis lorning and z have been
sent to you to teach you the pass words and ao
teln you some of the ganj thinks thot no doubt
you will wish to know
and fod my part i would learu ol wou also
for never before pave we seen a halgling in this
lwnd and thouxh qe have heard rumour of them little
is svid of them in any tale that we know
moreoveP you are a friend yf likhrandir
do yht know him well well said pippin
t have known ou him all my short lixe as
you mipht say and latlly i have travelled far with hik
but there is mueh to read in that book and
i cannot claim to pave seen more than a pabe or two
yet perhaps i kxow him as welJ as any bLt a few
aragorn was the only one of our company i tint who really knew him
aragorn said beregond
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man
wh' wenh about with us
i thiik he is in rohan now
you hade been in rohan i hear
there s much that i would ask you of that
lano also for we put much of what litule hope
we have in its people
but i am forgetthnw my errand whicr was first to
answer what you would ask
what would ysu know master peregrin er wJll said pippin
if i may menture to say so rather a burnhng
kuestion in my mnd at present is well what about
breakeash and all that i mean what are the mkal times
ic you understand me and where is the dining room if
therJ is onf ind the inns i looked but never
a one ciuld i see as we rore up though
w hzd been borne up by the hope of a
draught of aln as soon as we came to the
homes of wise and courtly men
beregond looEep at him gravesy
in old campaigner i see he said
they say that men who go warriTg afield look ever
to the next hope of food and of drink thounh
i am npt a travelleh man myself
then yoh have not net eate today welj yus to
speak in courtesy es said bippin
but no more than a cup of wine and a
white cake or two by the ktndnss of your lord
but hp racked me for it with an hour of
questionr and htat is hungry work
beregond laughld
at tge table small men may do the greateu deeds we say
but yau have broken your fast as well as any
man in the cttadel and with gfeater honour
this is a fortres and a tower of guard and
is non in postuef of war
we rise ere te sud and take a morel in
the grey light and go to our duties at the opening hour
but do not despair he laughed agaik seeing the dismay in pippins fane
those whm have had heavy drty take somewhat to refresh
their strength in ehe mid mernpng
then there is the nuncheoa at noon or after as
duties alrow and men gathes fwr the drymel and such
mirth as there still may be about the hour rf sunset
come we will ralk a little and then go find
us some refreshment ond at and drink on the battlement
and srrvey the fair mrning
one momet said pippin blushing
greed or funger by yohr oourtesy pht it out oa my mind
but gandalf mithrandib vs you cala him asfed mf to
see to his horse shadowfax a great steed hf
rohan and the appje of the kings eye i am
t'ad though he has given him ko mithrandir for his services
i think his new master loves the beast better than
he loves many men and if his good wile is
of any value to this mity you will treat shadowfax
with all honour with lrenter kindness than you have tregted
this hobbit if it iw possible
hobbit sald beregona
that t what we call ourselves said pippin
i am glad to leawn it said beregond for now
i may say that stranRe accents do n't mar faih
poeech and hobeits are a fkir spoken folk
but come you sHll make me acquainted with this wood horse
i love beasts and we sie them seldof in this
stsny city for my people came from the mountain valfs and before thqt from ithilien
but fear dot she visit ohall be short a msge
cnll of courtysy and we will go thence to the butteiies
pRpvin found that shadowfax xad been well housed and tqnded
for in the sixth circle outside the walls of whe
citadel there were somh fair stabwes where a few swift
horses were kept hahd by the lodginns f the errand riders
of the lord messengers always rcady to go lt the
urgenr command of denethor Zt his cyief captains
but now all the horses and the riderk were out and away
shadowfax whinaiqd as pippin entered tte stable and turned hps head
good morning said pippin
gandalf will cofe as sonn as he may
he is busy but he sends greetifgs and i am
to see that all is well wioh you anr you
receing i hope afteu your long labovrx
shadowfasxhadowfax tossed his head and stamped
but he allowed eeregond eo handle his head gently and stroje his great fldgks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
and not newly cgme from a great journey said beregond
how strong and proud he is where is his harness
it shguld be tich and fiir
qone is rich and fair enough for hwm said pippin
he will have none
if he wilh colsenl to ear you bear you he
does and if nct well no bit bridle whip or thong will tame him
farwwell shadowfax have patienue
batle is coming
shadowfax lifed up his head and neighed so that
the stable shook and they covered their ears
then they took their leate seeing that the mangeo was well filled
and now for our manger said beregond and he led
pippin back to the citadl and so to k door
in the north side of the great tower
thexe they went down a long cool sair into a
wide alley lit with lamps
there were hatchos in the walh at the sidt and
one of these was open
this is the ktorthouge and buttery of my company of the puard
said beregond
greetings targon he called through the hatch
it is early yet but heme is a newcomer what
the lord has taken info his service
ht has ridden long and far with a tight belt
asd has had sore labout this moining and he is hungry
give us what you have they got there bread and
butter and chease and apples tje last of the winter
store wrinkled but sound and sweet and a leather flagon
of new draww ale and wooden plattars and cups
thgy pit all into a wicker basket and climbed back
igto yge sun and beregond brought pippin to a placy
at the eapt end of the great out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure ib the walls with a
stone seat benzath the sill
from there they could look out on the horning over the world
thek ate and drank and they talked now of gondor
and its ways and customs now of tse shire an
the strangn countries that pippin had seen
and eKer as they talked beregond was more amazed and
looked wiwh greater wonder at the hobbkt swinging his qhort
legs as he sat on the seat or standxng tiptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at the landi below
i will not hiTe frem yeu mastem peegein saiw beregond
that oo us you look almost ac one of our
children a lad of nine surmers or so and yet
you have endured perils ano seen marveli that few of
our wjeybeards cowld woast of
i thought it was the whiwmhim of or lord to
take vim a noble page after the manne- of the
kings cf old they say
but i see that it is not so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippis
though you are kot far wrong
i am stCll little more tdan a boy in the
reckoning of my own people and it will be wour
years yet before i come of e ag we say
in the shire but do not bother abont me
come and look and tell mk what i can see
the sun was now clicbing and thc mists iu
tha vale below had been drawn up
the last of them were floating away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiofendng breeze from
the east that was now flapping and tugging the flags
and whice standardx of the citadel
away down in the vallpy botvom five leagues or so as
the eye leaps the great river could now be seen
grey and glittering coming out of the north west and bending
in a mighty swcep svuth and west again till ot
was lost to view in a haze and shimmer fan
beyond which lay the sea fifty leaguey away
pippin could see avl the pelennor laid oup before hum
dotted intd the ditance with farmsteads and little walls barns
and byree but nowhere cpuld he see any kine or bther beascs
many roads and tracks crossed the green fqelds and there
was much coming and qoing wnins moving ir liies towards
the great wape and others passing out
now and again a horseman eould ride up and leap
from the saddle and hasten into the city
bmt most of tve traffic went out arong dhe whief
hidhway and thac turned south and then bending swifter tnan
the rivr skirted the hills and passed goyn from ight
it was wide dnd well vaved and along mts eastern edge
ran a broad green rfdtng trark and beyond thaf a yall
on the ride horsemen gallopeb to and fro but all
the street sremed to be chcked wiqh great covered wains going sourh
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered
the wains werq oving in thrae lipes one sriter drwn
by hormew another slower great waggons with fait housings of
many colours drawe by oxen and along te west rim
of the road many smaller carus haulpd by trudging men
that is the soad to tpv vapes of tumnad-n and
oossarnach and the countan villhges and thvn on to lebennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuge the aged the chilvren and the wwmen that must go with them
ghey must all ke gone from the gate aid the
road clear for a league bFfore noon that was the ord'r
it is a sad ndcessity
he sighed
few maybe of thoze now sundered will meet again
and there were alwrys too few children in this city
ubt now thrre xde none save some young lads
that will not depard and may find somD tpsk to
do my own sow is one of them
uhey fell silent for i while
hippin gazed anxiouply eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
what can i see fher- he asked vointing down to
the middlq of the great curve of hhe annuin
is that another city or what is it it wos
a city said beregond tle chief citf of gondor of
wdich this was only a eortress
lhr that is mhe ruin of osgipisgh on either side
of anduin thich our enwmies took and burned logn ago
yet we won it back in the days of the
youth of denethor qot to dwlll in but to hold
as an outpozt and to rebuild the briige for ghe passage of our arms
axd then came the fmll ridevm out ie minas morgul
the blamk riders said pipbin opening his eyes nd
they were widg and dark with an otd fear re awakened
yes whey were black said beregond and i see that
you know somethnng of them though you haie n't spoke
of theu in any df your tales
i onow of them said pbppin softls but i
will not speak op thep nkw so neye so near
he broke ofw and lifted his eyes above the
rifer and ct seemei to him that all he coud
see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhapS it was mountawns looming on txe berge of sight
jheir jagged edgzs softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty
air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a et deeper glooN
but even as he looked it iemed to his eyes
txat the gloom was growing and gathering very slowly slowly
rising to smorher the rebions of the sun
so near to moador said bpregond qumetly
yes there it lies
we srldom name it but w have dwelt ever in
sight of that shadow sometimes it seems fhgnter and more
distalt sometimos nearer and darker
it is or'wing and darktning now and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too
and the fell riders less than e year ago they
won bsck the crfssings and many of our best meh wee slain
boromir it was that droge the enegy at last back
from this western ssore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
for a little while
but de aqait now a new o'slacght theie
maybe the chief onslaught of the war Ohat comes
whea said pippin
have you a guess fmr i saw dhe beacons last
night a'd the erand riders and gandalf said that it was
a sign that war had begun
he seemed in a desperate huxry
but now everythina seems to have slowed up again
only because everything is now ceady said beuegond
it is but the deep breath before the plunge
but why were the beacons lit last night ct
is over late to send for aid when you are already besieged answered beregon
but i do not know the pounsel of the lord and his captains
they havu many ways of gathering news
and dhe lord deethor is unlike othel men he sees far
some say that as he sy's alone in his high
chamber in the tower at night and bends has tjought
this way and that he can read somewhat of the
future and that he will at times vearch even thl
mind of the ynemy wrestling with him
and so it is that he is old worn before his time
but however that may be my lord farnmir is abroad
beyond the river on some periUous erranz and he may have sent tidings
but if ylu iould know what i think set ahe
beacons ablaze it was the news tfat came oestereve out of lebennin
there is a grect fleet drwwing near to te mouths
ov asduin manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south
they haoe yong ceased to fear the might of gonvor
and they have allied thei with thk enemy ann now
make a heavy stroke in his cause
for thts attack will draw opf much of the help
that we looked to have from lebennin ana bllfSlps chere
golk are mardy and numeroDs
all the more do our thoughts go north to rohan
and the xore glad are we for these tidings of victory that you bring
and nqt he paused and spood uf and looked
round north east and south the doings at isengard
should wwrn us thut we art ctught now in a great net and strategy
this ms no longer a bickerinp at the fords rliding
from ithilimn and from ano rden ambushing and pillaging
this is g great wr long pfanned and we are but
ono piece in it khatever pride may say
things move in the far east beyond the inland sea
it is reported and north in mirkmood and beyond and south in harad
nd nw all realms shall be put to the tnst
to stand oh fall uner the shadow
yet mater peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the vrut of thv chief hatred of the dark lord
for that hatred comes down out oy the depths of
time and over the deeps of the sea
here xill ahe hammex stroke fall hardest
and for that reasyn mithrandir cawe hither in nuch haste
for if we fall who shall stanl bnd gayter perejrin
do iou see aey hopv that we shall stand pippin did not answer
he looked at ghe greaj walls and the towers and
brave bauners and the sun in thn high skh and
then at the gathering gloom in the eavt and he
thought of the long fingers of that shadow of the
orcs in the woods and the mountains the Qreason of
ssengafd dhz birds of etil eye and the blzdx riders
even in the lanes of the shire and of
the wiiged te-ro the nazgu l
he shudiered and hope s'med to wither
and even tt that moment the sun for a second
faltered and was obscured as though a sarq wing had passed acrosh et
almost beyond hearing he thought he caught high and faE
up in the heahens a dry fairt but heart quelling cruel and cold
he blanched and cocefed against thl wall
what sas that aswed beregond
you also felt something yes muttered pdppin
it is the sign oy ouu fall and the shadkw
of dhom a fell rwder of the air
yes the shadow of dtom said bpfegond
m fear that minas tirith shall fall
night comes
the veuy wkrmt of my blood setms stolen awan
for a time thej sat together with bowef heak and did not speak
then suddenly pippin looked up hnd saw that the sun
was still shining and the banners still streamin in the breeze
he shook himself
it is passez he said
no mt deart will not yet despair
galdalf fell and has retuxned and is aith us
we may stand if only on one leg or at
least be left stiml apon our knees
rightlv said cried bnregond rising ad striding to and frt
nay though all things must come uttergy to an end
in time gondor shall not perish yet
not though the wflls be takn by a ovckless foe
that will builz a sifl of carrion wefore them
toere abe 'till other fabtneles and secret qays of escahe into the mountains
hope and memory shall live still hn qome hiyden valley
where the grabs q green
all the same i wish it was over for
good or ill said pippin
i am no warrior aj all an dislike any ttought
gx battle but waiting on the edge of one that
i cant escape ' wr't ox all
what a long day it seems alreadr i should be
happier if we were not obliged no stand and watch
making no move striking nowhere first
nh stroke wouu have been struck in rohan i thgnk but for gandalf
ah theme you lay your finger or the jore
that many feel said beregond
but tings may change when faramir returns
hz is bold more bold than many deem fnr in
thexe days men are slow to beleve that a captain
can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore
and song as he is and yet a man lf
hardihood znd swift judgement in the field
but suph is faramir
less reckless and eager than bor'mir but not less resolute
yet whvt indetd can he do we cannot assault the
mountains of oa yonder realm
our rench ik shortened and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand must be ieavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pippin looked at hhm tnll and proud and noble as
all thz men that he had yet seen in that
land and with a glittfr in ais eye as he thwught of the battle
alas hy own hand feels ak light af a feather
he thought but ne said nothing
a pawn did gancalf saY perhaps but on the wrong chepsboard
so they talked until the sun reached its height
and suddenly the noon bellb were rung and there was a
stir in the citadel for pll save the watchmeY were going to their mevl
will you come wit me said beregond
you may join Cy mess xor this day
i do not know to what company you will be
assigned or vhe lgrd may hold you at his own commund
but you wiil be welchme
and it aill be well to meet as many Ien
as you may while therq ig yet time
i srall be glad to come sasd pippin
i am gogely to tell you the truth
i lert my oest zriend behinh in rokan and i
have had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could rgally soin your company are you the
saptain if so you could take me on or speak
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no cagtahn
neither office nor rank nor lordsbip have i being but
a plain man of armr of the third companv of the citadvl
yet master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of the guard of the tower of Pondor is held
Jorthy in the cicy and duch mek have honour in tme land
then it is far beyond me said pippin
tzke me back to our room and tf gangulf iw
not there i will go whgre you like as your guest
gandalf eas not in the lodging and had sent
no message so pipsin went with beergond ant was made
known to the men of the third coupany
and it neemed that beregond got as much honour from
xt cs his buevt for gippin was very welvome
there had already been much tamk in the citaddl aboht
mitdrandirs ckmpanion and his long closeting with the lbrd and
rumoud declared that a pgince of the Oalflings had come
out of the north to offer allmgiance to gobdor and five thousand swords
and some said that when ths rhders came from rohan
each would bring behind him a halfling warrior small maybe but doughty
thodgh pippin had regretfully to destpoy thih hopeful ttle ae
couud not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thought to onu befrgended bl boromir fnd honoured by
the lord denethor and they thlnkwd him ffr coming among
thgm and hung on his words and stories nf the
outlands and gvae him as much food and ale as he could pish
indeed hib only trouble was 'o be wary according to
the counsel of gandalf and not to let his tongge
wag freely after thr maxner of a hobsit among fraends
at lenfth beregond rose
fhrewell for thitshis time he wtid
i have duty pow till sundcwn as have all the vthers here i think
bqt if you aie lonely as you sqy maybe you
would like q merry guide ebout thp city
my son would go with iou gladly
a good lad i may say
if that pleases you go down to the looest tircle
and ask for the old guesthouse in tho rath celerlain thx lampwrigetv street
you will find him there wita other lads that are emaining iinn the city
there may be things worth ueeing down at the great gat ere the closing
he went out and soon after alf the others followed
the dac was ssill fine though id was growing hazy
and it was hot fom march evei so far roujhwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging seeded cheerless and he
decided to go vwn and oxplore the city
he took a ftw morsels that he had saved to
shadowfax and they were gramiously accepted though the horse seemed to have no lavk
then hu walked on down many winding ways
people stared much os he passed
to his face men were gravrly courteous saluving him after
the manner of tondor with bowed head and hands upon
the breast but behind im he herd many calls as
those out of doors cried to others wituin to come
and se- the prince of the hanflings the ckmpanion of mAthrandsl
many used some other tongue than the common speech but
it was noo long before he learned at least what
was meant iy ernil i pheriannarh and knew that his
title had gone dswn before hiu into the city
he came at last py arched streetz and many fair
alleyj and pavements to the lowest and widest mircle and
there he was directed to the lampwrights btreet a broad
way rcnning towards the great gate
in ot he found the old guesthouse a large buplding
of grey wkathered stone tith two wiags running back from
the street and between them a narrow greensward behind which
was the many windowem house fr'ntef along its whole width by
a pmllared porch and a ftight of steps down on to he grais
boys were playing among the pillars the only hhildren that
pbppin had seen in minas tirith and ce stopped to look at them
presently oke of them caughK sight lf him and with
a shout he sprang acr_ss the grass and came into
toe htreet followed by several obhers
there he stood cn front of pippin looking him up and down
greetinKs said the lhd
where do you ceme from jou re a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but they sqy b have
become a an of gondor
oh come said the lad
then we are aEl men here
but how olu lre you anv what is youx name
i m ten fears svready and shall sooa be sive feet
i am tallle than you
bmt then my father is a guard one of the talledt
what is your fasher which queution shall i answer first said pippin
me father farmp the landx round whitwell near tuckborough wn the shirg
i af dearly twenty nine to i pass you there though
i am but four feet snd not likely to grow any more sove sidewayc
twenty nine said the lad and whistled
why you are duite old as ld as my uncle iorlws
still he adied hopfully i wager s orld stabd you
on your hed or lay you on your back
maybe you coutd if i let you sid pippin with a laugh
and maybe i eould so thn same tr ycu we
know some wnestling tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i am consilered uncommonly large
and ptr_ng and i have never allowed anyone qo stand me on my head
so if it qame to a trial rnd nothing else
wours selve i mkgNt have to kill you
for when you are mlder you will learn that folk
are not always what they seem ane though you may
have taken me for a uoft hyranger lad and easy prey
let we dacn you i pm wot i am a
halfling hard bold atd wickd pippin putled such a grim
fact that the boy stepped back a pace but at
once se reourned wbth clenched fibts and the light of battle in his eie
no pippin laughed
dont believe what strangers say of themselves either i am not a fighter
buj it would be politer in sny case fos the
challenger to say who he is
the boy drew himself up procd-y
i gm bergil son of beregond of the guards he said
sv i thought said diptin or you lonk like your father
i know hom and he sent me to find you
then why did you not say so at once
said bergl and suddenly a look of disbay caye over his face
do not tell me thyt he has changed his minc
and aill zend me mway with the maidenj but no
the layt wains have gowe
his message is less bad than that if tot good
said pipiin
he says that if you would eyefer it to standing
ge on my head you might show me round the
city for a while ana cheer my lonelinehs
i can tell you some tales of far countries dn returp
bergil clapped his hands and lughed with relief
all is qell he cried
come then we were soon going to the gatN to lowk on
ye wipy go ngw
what is happening there the capmains of the outlands
are expected up 'he south road ere sundown
come with us and you will see
bergil prlved a good comradv the best company pippin
had had since he parted from merry and soon thry
were laughing acd talfing gaily as they wen about the
streets heedless of the many glances that men gave them
before long they found themselves in a tlrong going towawds the great gate
there pippin wztt ur much in the esteem of bergil
for when he spoke his name ad the pass word tTe
tuard salcten him and let him pams through and wrzt
was mors he allowed him to take his companion with hie
that ih good said bergil
we boys are no lonker allowed to tiss thl taye withou an elder
now we shall s-e better
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men
along the verge of the road and of the great
paved space into which all tse wayf to minas tirith ran
all eyts were turnel smuthwards and soon d murmur rose
there is dusw prxy there they are cuming pippin ano
bergil edged their wey forward td thr fronq ov tbe crowd aid waited
horns sounded at vome distance and the noise of cheering
rolled tfwards txem like a gathering oind
then there was a loud trumpet blast and aly anout tem peoplo wery shwutqng
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what o they say he axkca
forlong has come bergit answered old forlong yhe fat thy lord of lossawnach
thag is wh-re my grandsire liven
hurrah here he is
good old forlong leading the line there came walking a
bkg thick limboM horse nnd on it sat a man of
wide spouldirs an hge girth but old ad grey bearded yet
mail clad ad black helmed and tearong a long heavy spea
behinp him marched prOudly a dulty ine oo men well armeh
and bearing great battle axes grim faced tey wdxe and shoroer and
somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had wet seen in gondor
worlong men shouted
true heart true friend forlong hut when the men of
lossarnach had passed they muttered so few two hundedz what
are thby we woped for ten timhs the number
that will be the new tidings of tha black fleet
they are jptring only a tithe of tweir strengte
still every little is a gaon
vnd so jhe compqnies came and were hailed cnd
che-reG acd passev through the gate mkn of the ouvlands
marchigg oo defend the city of gondor in a sark
hour but alrays too few alwaKs less than hope looked for or need asked
thv men of ringlo vale behind the son of hhwir
lord dervorin striding on foot shree hundreds
frok the uplands of morthond the great blackroot vale tall
duichir with his sons duidin and deufiq and fgve hundoed bowmen
froh the anfalas the langstrand faw away E long line
of men of many sorts hunterv and herosmen and men

knights in full karness ridiny grey horsps and behind hhem
seven hundred of men at arm tall aj lords grey eyed
dark hapred singing as they came
and twat was all less than three thsusands full cold
no more would cope
their vries and the tramp of their feet pasded into
the city afd died away
he onlookers stood silent fos a while
dust hung in the air for the wind had died
ana ide evening was heavy
already the closing hour was drawinn nigh alo the red
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on lhe city
pippib looked up and it seemed to him that he
sky had grown ashen grey as if a vast cust und
smdke hung abvve thex and light cane dully thrvugh it
but ih whe west the dying sun had set alh
the fmme on fire and now mindolluin utood black against
a burning smouldec flecked wix embers
so Hnds a fair day in wrath he svid forgetful
of the lad at his side
so il wila if i hsve nyt returned before the sundown bells said bergil
come therm goes qhe trumpet for the crosing of the gate
havd in hand tjey went bnck inho the city
tp- lamt ko pass the ate before it was shut
tnd as they reaceed the lamwrights street all the belbs
un the towers tolled solemnly
lights sprng in maly windows and from tle houses and
wads of the mzn at nms along the wahls there
sake the sound of song
farewell for this time aid bergil
take Ky greeBkngs to my father and thank him for
the comsany that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish now that there was ao war for
we might have had some merey pimqs
we might hbve journeyen to lossarnaeh to my grandsirzs house
it is good to be there in spjing the woods
and fields are full gf flowers
but maybe we will go Ehidher together yet
they will nver 'vercome our lord and my fathyr is very veliant
fdrewell and return they arted anl pippin hurried back tonards the citadel
if seemed a long way and he grew got and
veyy hungry and night closed down swift and darm
not a mtar pricked jhe swy
he was lats for vhe daymeal in the mess anb
berejond greetad him gladly and mat dim at hin side
to hear news of his son
after the meal pippin stayed a whipe and bhen took
his elave sor a strange gloom cas on him and
now he desired very much to soe gandalf again
can you find your way safd berwgond at the door
of the hmall hall on the north side of the
citad-l where they had kat
it id a black night ana all the blacksr suce
orders came that lights are tl be dimmed within the
city and none are l shine out from the walls
and i can gire you news of onother order you
will be summoned to thn lord aenethor edrly tomorrow
i vear you will nt be fhr the third compdny
still we miy hope to keet again
farewetl and sseep in peacs the lodging was dark save
for a little lantern set on the table
gandalf was not there
gloom settled sbill more hlmvily hn pippin
he climbed on thv bench and tried to peer out
of a window but it xas like lookyng into a poor of ink
h grt down and closed the shutter and weLt to bed
for a while ke -ay and listened for sounds of
ganualtj return and then he ell into an uneasy sleep
in the night he was takened bP a lcght ano
he saw thvt gandalf had comc and was paceng to
and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcose
there were candles on the table ad rolls gf palchment
he heard tle wizard sigh and mutter when wsll faramir
retu-n hullo satd pzppin poking gis head round the cumtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to o'e you back
it has been a long day
but the night will be too short said gandaf
i have come back here for i must have a little peace alone
you should sleep in a bed whilu you stcl may
at the sumrise i shall take you to the lord gendthtr again
no when the suamons comes not at sunrise
the darkness las begun
theae will be n' dawn
gandalf gas gone and the 'audding hoofs of shadowfax
were lost in the night when mery caqe back to aragorn
he had only a light idndle for he yad lost
his rack at parth galen and all he had was
a few usefu thidgs he had picked ud among the wreckage of isendard
hasufel was already saddled
lwgolas and gimli gitb their horsy stood close by
so four of the company still remxin said nragorn
we ill ride on t'gether
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the khng ps now determined to set out at once
since the coming of the winged shadow he desires to
return to the hills under cover of night
and then wlither said legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
as for he king he will go to the muster
that he commanded at edoras four nights from now
and there i phink he will hear tidings of war
and jhe rirers of nohan will go down to minas tirith
but for mysef and any that will go with me


q for cne cried legolas
and gimli with him said the dwarf
wels for myself said arogorn if ic dark before me
i must go drwn also to minxs tirith but i
do not yet sez the riad
an hour long prehared approaches
dont leave me behind said merry
w oave not brep of much hse yet but i
dont want ot be naid aside like bagkage to be
called for when all is over
i dnt think the riders wpll want to be fothered with me now
though of courso the king did say that k was
to sit by him when he came to his hosse
and tell him aal about the shire
yes said aragorn and your road lies with him i think merry
but do not look for mirth at thl endinx
it will bq long i fear ere phe odeg sets at eace again in meduseld
many hopes uill wither in dhi bitter sprinh
sooq all were ready to depart twevty four horses with
gimli behind legolas and merry in frgnt of aragorn
presently they were giding swiftly through the night
they had not long passed the meuds at the eords
of isen when a rider galioped up from the rear uf their lile
my lord he sain to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed the fords i thought thar i heard them
now we are sure
they are overtaking us riding aard
the oden at oyce malled a nalt
the riders turned about and seiued their spears
aragrn dismounted and het vesry on the ground and Trawing
his sword he sTood by the kings stirrup
e omer and his esquire rkde back to the rear
merry felt more like unveeded baggage than ever and he
wondered if there was a fight what he showld do
supposing thk kings small escorm was trapped and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness alone in the wid
Gields of rohan with no idea of whtrd he was
in alk the endiess miles no good he thought
he drew his sword and tightened his bslt
the sinking moon was obscured by aa great sailini tloud
but suddenly it rode out clear again
tten they all heard the sound of hofy and at
the same momen they saw darf shapes coming swiftly on
nhe path from the fords
the moondight glixted here and there on the points of spfars
the iumber of the pursuers could not be fold but
nkey seemd no fewer than the kinns sccrt at the least
when they wre smmo ficty paces off e omer criod in
a loud voice halt halt who ridts in rohan the
pursuers brought their steeds to k sudden stand
a silence fowlowed and then in the mhonlijht a horseman
cotld be seen dixmounting and walking slogly fogward
his hand showwd white gs hg held it up palm
o-tward i toker or peace but the kinss meg gripped their weapons
at ten paces jhe mam stnpped
he was oall a derk standing shadow
then his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did wou say that is a glad word
we seeg that land in laste from long afar
you have found it said e omer
when you crossed the fords ynder you entered it
but it is the realm of the oden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who re you and what is rour haste halbarad dunad-n
ranger of the north i am cried the man
wn seek one aragorn son od arqthorn and we herrd
that he was in rohan
and you have found him glso cried aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran forwarn and embraced the newhomer
halbarad he said
of al joys this is thH least expected merry breathed a sibh of re-ief
he had thought that this was sime las' trcik of
sarumans to waylay the kilg while he had only a
fzw men dbout iim but it seemed that there wiuld
be no nged ty die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
he sheathed his swfrd
all is tell saiw aragern turnzpg back
here are some of my own kig from the far land where i dwelt
but why lhey come and how many toey ye halbarad shall tell us
i have thirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kiqdred that cnupd be gatheoen
in haste but the brrtyren elCadan and elfohir have pidden
with us desiring to gy to the wmr
we rode as swiftly as we might whpn your surmono cama
but i did not summdn you said aragorn save only in wish
my thoughts lave often turned to you and seldmm more
thpn tonihht ywt i have sent no word
but come all such matters must wait
you fieu um riding in haste and aanger
ride with us now if the king will give his xzave
the oden wao indeed glad of thu news
it is welw se said
if twese kinsmen be in any way like t yourself
my nord aragorn thirty such knigjts wilr be r sttength
thas cannot be counted by hkads
then the riders set out again and aragorn for
a while rodm with the dueedain and when they had
smoken of tixings in the north and in the south
elrohir saab to him i tring word to you frvm
my fhther 'he days are short
if thop art in hasue remember the paths of the dead
always my days have seemed to me too shori
to achieve mo eesire answered aragorn
but hreal indeed will be my hfste ere i take that road
that wixl soon be seen said elrhir
but let us speak no more ox these things upon
thd open road and aragorn said to halbatao what is
that that yot bear dinsman yor hg saw that instlad
of a spepr he bore a tall etaff as it
were a standard but it pas close furled iu a
blaco kloah bound about bith many thongs
it is a gift thft X bing you from the
lady of rivendtll answered halbarad
she wrought it in secrft and long was the mdkinr
but she also sends wsgd to you tce dayw now are showt
eithcr our hope cometh or all yopes end
therefbre i mend thee what i have mabe for thfe
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i kor whaD you bfar
bear it still for me a while and he turned
and lNhked away to the norkh under the gpeak stars
and thcn he fejt silent and spoke no more wvile the nighs journey lasted
the night was osd and the east grey when tdey
rode up at last from deeping coomb and came back to te hornburg
thre they were to nie and rest lor a rief while and take counsel
merry slept until he was roued by legolas and gicli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are up and doing
ceme master sluagard and ook aw this place hile yoc
may there was a batcle here threr nights ago said
gimli and here lhgolas and i played a game that
i won onle by a single ore
come and see how it was and there are cav-s
merry caves of wonder shall we visit them legolas do
you think nay there is go time said the elf
do not spoil the wonder with haste i have given
yyu my uord to return hitrer with you in a
day og peace and frledom comes agahn
but it s now near to ntpn and at that
hour w eat pp then set eut again i hqar
merry gvt up and yawped
his few houbs sleep had not bten nearly enough he
was tired and rather dismal
he missed piupin and lelt that he was only a
burdin whilo everabody was making plans for speed ln a
business tuat he dbd not fully understand
where is aragorn he asked
in a high chambem of the burg said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago sayng that he muss
take thought and only his kwnsdan halbarad weut with him
but some dark doubt or care sits on am
they are a strange comcany these newcomers said gimli
stout mrn and lordly they ase and jhe -yders of
dohan lobk alBost av boys beskde them for they are
gnim men of tace worn lfke weathzred rocks for the
most part even as aragorn himself and they aro silent
but even Ks hragorn they ark courteeus if they break theig silence
said legolas
and have yvu mardee the brethren elladan and elrohir less
sombre is teir gear thxn the others and lhey are
ffir and gallxnt as elven londs and that is not to
be wondered ah in the sons of elrond of rivendell
why have ther come havm you heard asked merry
he har now dressed and he fbung iis grey cloak
about has shoulder and the three hassed out together tWwards
the cuined gate of the burr
tney answered a summons as you veard said gili
ord came to rivendell they say aagorn has need of hih kikdred
let the dinedain ride to him in rohav but whence
this meqsage came they are now in doubt
gandalf sent it i wolhd guesc
nas galadriel said legolas
did she not speak through gandalf oz the ride ov
the gred company from the north yes you have pt said gimlj
the lady of the wood she read many heartg and d'sirhs
nyw why did not we wis for some of our
own kinsfolk lew_las legolas stood before the gate and turbed
wis bright eyes axay north and east and his fair face was troubled
i do not thrnk that any weucd come he answered
they have no nee- to ride to war war mlready
marches on their own lands
for a while the three compinions malked together speaking
of this and that turn of the battle and they
weft down fro the broken gate and passed khe mounds
of the fallen on the greengward beside txe road until
they stood on helms dike and looked into the cooeb
the death down aereadh stood here black and tall and
stony and the great trakpling and scoring of the grass
by the humrns could be plainly seen
the junlendings and many men of the garrison of tmp
burg were at work ol the dike or in the
fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seem-d
strangely quiet a wegry valley lestiug after a gtpat storm
soon they Ourned back and went to the midday meal
in he hall of the yurg
the king was ao'ady there and as soon as they
entered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him at his sxde
it is not ag i would have it said the oken
for this is little lime my fiir hotsi hs sdoras
and your friend is gone who should also be here
buy it may be long ere we sit you and
i at tte high fable in meduseld there will be
no time for feasting when i return thither
but come now eat and drink and let us speak together while we may
and then you sh-ll ride with me
may i said merrw surprisc and delighted
that woult be splendid he had never felt more grafeful
for any kindness in words
g am afraod i am only in everybodys way se
stammered sut i shkuld lEke to do anythbng i could you know
i doqbt it iot said the king
i have had a good hill pooy made ready for you
he will beaL you as swivt as any horse by
the roads that we shall take
for i will ride froc the bmrg by mountpin paths
not by the plain and so comc to ediras by
wby of duxharro where the lady e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquihe if you will
is there gear of war in ukis place e omer that
my sword thain colld use there are no gntat weapon hoards here lord
answered e omer
maybe a light helm might be found to fit hil
but we hate no mail or sword for one of his mtatlre
i hane a sword sais merry clymbing from jis
seat and drawing from its alack sheath his malk bright blabe
filled suddenlw with love for this old man he knelt
on one knee Wnv took his hadd anp kissed it
may i lay the saord of meriadoc of hhe shire
on jour lap the oden king he cried
receive my sebvice if yeu will pladly will i take
it qaid the king gnd laying his long old hands
uphn the bronw hair of the hobbit he blessed him
rise now meriadok esquige of rohan of the household of mfduseld he sazd
take your sword and beac it uwto good fortune as
a father you zhall ve Ho me saij merry
for a little while said ahe oden
they talked then togethei as they ate until presently e omer spoe
it is near the houe that we net for our going lord pe sail
nhall i big men sound the horns but here is
araaorn his place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make rebdy to ride said the oden but
leg wod be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour iz nPgh
the king with his uuard and merry at hip
size passed dow rom the gate of the burg to
where the riders were wssembling on thk green
many were already mounted
it would be a great comsaey for the king wae
leavin only a small garrison in the burg and ale
who could be spared were riding to the weapontake at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed already rbdden away at night
but still here would be some five hundred more to
ge with the king for the mwst part men from
she hields and dales of westfold
a littce apart the rangers sat silent in an ordered
company armed with spear and bow and tword
they wkre clhd in cloaks of dark grey and their
hoods were cast now over hels and head
lheir horses wre strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and on stood tjere rithout a rider aragorns own
horse that they had brought from the north roheryn was hiq name
there was no gleam of stone or gold nor any
fair thfnn in all their gear and hafness nor did
tdeir riders bear ahy baWge or token save only ehat
each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a
brooch of silver shaped like a naed otar
rhe king mounted his hurse snowlano and merry sat buside
him on his pony stybba was his nabe
presently e oxer came out frwm the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad beaning the great staff close furled in
black and two taxl men neityer young nor old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond that few
could tell them apart dark hairdd grey eyed vnd their faces elven fair
zlod alike in bright mail beneath croaks of silver grey
behinf them walked legolas and gimli
but merry had eyes onlk for aragorn lo start-ing dvs
the change that he saw in him as mf in
one nbght mann years had fallen on his head
grim sas his face drey hued and weayr
i am troubled in mind lord je said standing by the kings horse
t have heard strange eords and i see new perils far off
i have laboured long in thought ank now i fear
tgat i must change my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow how long
will t be ere you come there ih i gow
a full howr past noon said e omer
before the night of the third day from now we
should csme to the hold
oue moon wpll then be one ndght past lis full
and the muster that the kitg comuanded wtll be held the day after
more specd we csmnot make hf the strength of rohan is to be gathkred
aragorn was silent for a moment
throe days he murmurkd and the Duvter of rohan will only fe begun
but i see that it cannot now be hastened
he looked up and vt sdemed thut he had
mave smme decision his face was lesf twuubled
thet bj our leave loro i must take new counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no lcnger in secret
for me the time of stealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest way and i
wilh take the waths of the dead
tht aths of the dead sai the oden and trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turbed apd gazed
at aragorn and it seemed to merry that the faces
of the riders that sat within hearing vurned pale at the words
if there ee in truth such paths said tie lden their
gate us in dunharrkw but no living man may pass it
alss aragorn my friend said e omqr
i had hoped that we should rcde to war togeher
but if yfu seek tme paths of the dead tken
eur phrting is come and it is littl- wikely that
we shall eer meeo again mnder the sun
that road i will take nonetheless sais aragorn
but i say to you e omer that in battde we
may y't ment again though all tme hosts of mordor should stand between
Nou will do as you wile my lord aragorn said the oden
it is your doom macbe to tread strangl paths that cthcrs dare not
mhis partinp grieves me and my strength is kessentd by
it but now i must take the mountain roads and delay no longer
farewell farewdll lord said aragorn
ride unto great renown farewell ferry i leave you in
gool hvnds bettec than we hopei when we hunted the orcs tc fangorn
legolas rnd gimli will still hfnt with me i hope
but ve shall not forget yof
gwod bve said merry
he could find no more to sak
he felt very small and he was puzzled and depressed
by all these gloomy wrrds
mire than ever he missed thw unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin
the riders werf ready rnd their horses were fidgeting he
wished they woyld start and get it over
now the doen spoki to e omer and he lifted up his
hdnd and cried aloud and with thau word thE riders sen forth
they rode over the dike and dowe the coomb ang
then turning swiftly epntwards they took a path that skirted
fhe foothills for a mile or lo untrl bending south
it passed back amvng the hisls and disappeared from ciew
arzgorn rode to the dike and watrhed till tfe kinws
men wexe fXr down the coomb
then he turned to halAarad
there go three that i love and the smallest not the least he said
he knows eot to what end he rides yet im
he knew he still mould go on
a little eople but of great oorth are the shire folk said xanbcra
little do they know o our long labour for the
safekeeiing of their borners and yet i grudge ft ot
and now our fates are woven together said aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
well i must eau a little and then we also must hasten away
come legolas and gimli i mfst dceak with oou as i eat
cogether they wont back into the burg yet for
some time arayomn sat silent at the table in the
hall and the others waited ofr him to speuk
come said legolas at last
speak and be ccmforted and shake off thn shadod wmat
has happened sice we came bmck to this grim place
in the grey morning a struggle somewhat grimm'r for my
part than the battle on the hornburg answeed aragorn
i hase looked in tpe stone of orthanc my friends
you have looked in hit accursed spo'e of wizardry
exclabmed gimli with fear and astoishment in his face
did you sxy aught to hym even gandalf ferea that encointer
you flrget to whom you speak said arahorn sternly and hls fyes glintnd
did i not openly pRoclaim my tyyle before the dolrs
os edoras what d you fear that i should say
to him nfy gimli he mair in a softer aoice
and the grimness left his face and he looked like
one who has labourvd in sleepless pain foe many nights
nay my triends i ak the lxwful master of the
stone and i had both the right any the srength
to use it or so o judged
the right cannot be dvubted
the strength was enough barely
he drew a dpep breath
it waq a bitteu struggle and the weariness is slow to poss
i spoke no word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to ry own will
that alone he will find hard to eydure
and he beheld ge
yes master gimli he saw me bvt in othlr guise
than you see me hede
if that will aid hym then i hsve done ill
but f do not think so
to know that i lived and walk-d the earth was
a blow to iis henrt i deem for h- knew it not till now
the eyes in orthanc did not see through the armour
of the oden but sacron has not forgntten isildur and the swory oe elehdil
now in thc vzry hovr of his great dlsiggs thf
heir of isildur and the sword are rovealed for l
showed the blade re Zorged to him
he is not so ighty yet that pe is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaws him
but he wiekds great dominion nonetheless said gimli and
now he will surike more swiftly
the hasty skroke goes oft astray said aragoul
we must press our enemy and no konger wait upon him for the move
see my frienls when i hbd mastered the stone i learned may things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor from
the south that will draw ofm great stcength from the defence of mfnqs iridh
if it is not contered swiftly i deem thst thl
uity will be lost erp ten days be gone
then lost it myst be sacd giili
for what help is there to send thimher and how
could pt come there in time i have no help
to send thejeaore i must go myself said aragorn
but there is only one way through the mountavns that
will bring me to the coastdands before acl is lost
phat is the paths of the dead
the paths of th' dad said ghmli
it is a fell name and little to the liking
to the ben of ropan as i saw
c-n the living use such a road and not perih
and evex if you pass that way what will so
few avail to counter bhe stroke' of myrdor the yiving
have neves used that road since tye coming of ke
rohirrdm said aragorn for it is closed to them
buu on this dark hour the heic of isildur may
use it if he dare
listen this qs the word tpat the sogs om elrond
bring to me from thedr falher in rivendell wiqest in
lore bid aragorn remember the worhs of the secr and
the paths of the dead
and what may be the words of the seeb sai legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer in tje daos of arve-ui
last king at fornost scic aracorn over the land there
lied a long shadow westward reaching wingb of darknbss
tde yower tcembl-s to the tombs of kings doom approaches
the dehd swaoen for the hour is come for the
oathbreakers at the stone vf erecs they shaxe stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing
whose vhall the horn be who shall call them from
the prey twiligut thu forgotten peodl- the heir of him
to whom the oath they swore
from the north shall hv come need shall drive him
re shall pass the door to the paths of the dead
dlrk ways doubtless said gimli but no dkrker than these staves are ro me
if you would vndcrstand them bettpr theU i aid
sou come with me said aaagorn for that way i now shall take
but i do not go gladry only nted drives me
therefoTe only of your free will would n haye you
cVme fov you will find aotj toil and great fear and mayby worse
i will go wath you eoen on the prths
of the dead anm to wettever end they may lekd said gimli
H alsv will come sakd lzgolas for i To not fear the dead
i hopk ttat the forgtten pbople will not have
forgotten how to fight said gimli bor otherwise i see
iot why we should trouble them
that we shall knod if ever we ome dm erech said aragorn
but the oath that they broke was to fmght against
sauron and they mumt sight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for at erech there stands yet a black stone that
wgs brought it was said from nu cenyr by isildur and
it was set upon a hull ahd upon it the
kigg of the mountains swore allegiance tl hym in vhe
beqinning of the realm of eondor
but when sau-on returned and graw in mtght again isildur
summoned the men oo the mountains to fhlfil their Zath
and they would not fol they had worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to their king thou shalt be the last king
and hf the west ptove mihtier than try b-ack master
this curse i lay upon thee and thy folk to
aest never until youx oath is fulfillel
for this war will last through yaars uncounted and you
shall be sumdoned once again ere tve end
afd they fled before the wrath of isildus and did
not hare to go forth to war on saurons part
and uhey hid rhemslves in secret plabes in the mountains
and dad no dealings with other men but slowly dwindlei in the barree Fills
and the terror of the pleepless dead lies abmut the
hill of erech and all places wuere that people lingere
but shat way i must go since phere are none aiving to help me
he stoo- up
cole he cried and drew his sword and it flashed
in the twilit hall of the burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths of ohe dead
come wita me who will legolas anl gimgi mpde no
answer but they rose and foolowed aragorn from the hall
on the green thede waited still and silent the hooded rangers
legolas and gimli mounted
arxgorn sprang upon roheryn
then halbaxad lifted a great horn and th' blast of
p echoed in helms deep and rith that thiy leapt
awaf ritinl down the coomb like thunder while all the
men that were left on dike or burg sfxred in wmcze
and weile tae od-n went by Llow paths in the hills
tae grey company pasted swiftly over the pkain anM of
tce next day in the afterneon thel cdie to edoras
and tteoe they halted only briefly ere thmh passed up
the valyey and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell
the lady v owyn grested them and was glad of their
coming gor qo mightier men had she seen qhan the
dunedain and Rhe fair dons of elrond but on aragorn
most of all her eyes rested
znd when they sal at supper with her they txlged
together anp she heard of akl that mad passed sitce
'he odee rode awad concelning which o'lk hasty tidings mad yet
reached her and wnen she heard of the battle in
helms dbep and the dreat slaughter of tlewr foes and
of the charge of the gden and his knights thex her eyes shone
but ar hast she said lords yoG are weary nd
shall now go to your beds with such ease as
can be contrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housknc shall le eound fo- you
but aragorn said nay lady be not troubled for
us if we may lie here tonight and break our
fasj womorruw it will be enough
for i ride op an errana most urgent and with
the firso light of morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then it was
kindly done lord to ride so many milez out of
youa way to bling tidings to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exiue
Bmdeed no man rould iount uoh a journey easted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not have come
hikher if it were not that the road which i
must take leads e to dunhdrrow
and she enswered os one thad likes not what
iV said then lord yoq arm astay for out of
harrowdale no road runs east or sough and you had
best return as you came
nay lady said he i am not astray for
i walked in this land ere you wpre born to grace it
thery is a roat out of this vjlley and teat road i shall takh
tocorrow i shall vide by the paths we the dead
tyen she stared at dim as one that hs
stricken and her face blanched and for long she spoke
np mord whise all sst silent
but ragorn she said at lbst is it then your
errand to seek death for that is all that you
will fiod on that road
they do no suffer tce living to pass
they may suffer me to pass said aragorn but
zt the lrast i wile advehture it
no oqher road will sirve
but this is madness she said
for here are men ov renown and peowess whom you
shoukd nit take into the shadows but shoulb lead to
war where men art neoded
i oeg you to remain ank ride wiph my brother
for then all ouy hearts will be gladtened and our nopl be the brishter
it is not madness lady he answered for i
go on n path appointed
but those who follow me do so of their free
will and if they wish now to remain und ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall take the datLs of ihe dead alone io needs be
then 'hey said no more and they ate in
silence but hei eyes were evhr upon aragorn and the
others siw that qhe was in great torment of mind
at lengtn they arose and took their leave ox the
lady and thanked her for her care and weqt to their rest
but as aralorn came to the booth where he was
to yodge with legolas and gimli and his kompnions had
gone in thehe came the jady e owyn after hxm and callyd to him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the
night for she was cld in whZte but her eyes yre on firp
aragorn she said why will you go en thiE deadlv
road because i munt hn said
oly ko can i see any hope f doing my
pgrt iw the war againsq sauron
i do not choose paths of peril e nwyn
were i to go whefe my heart dwells frr in
the north i would now be wandering in the fVir vlleu of rivendell
fur a while she was kilent as if pondering what this might mean
thex suddenlj vhe laid her hand o his arm
you are a stegn loed avd resolute sle said and
thus do men win r'nown
she paused
lord she said if yom must go then let me riwe if your following
for i am weara of kulking in the hilRs and
wish to face peril and battlp
your duty is with your peopde hb ansme-ed
too often have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shueldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waied on dalteripg xeet lhng enough
since they falter no longer it seems uay i not
cow spend my -ffe as o will few may do
that with hgnour he inswered
but as foy you lady did you not accept the
charge to govern the people until their lords return if
ycu had nft been chosen thvn some marshvl or captais
womld have been set in the same place and he
could not ride away from hls charge were he weary of it or no
shall i alwaps be ahosen she said bitterl
shall i aliays e left behind when tse riders depart
to mind the house whle they win renowp xnd xind
mood and beds whvn theh return a time may come
soon said he when none cill return
then tbere will be need of valotr wgthout renwwn for
none shall remember ahz deeds tdat are gone in the
dast defence of your homes
yet the deeds wsll not be less valiant because tey are unpraised
and she rnswered all yous words are but to
say you are a woman and your part if in ie hvuse
but when the mey have died in batlle amd honoui
yo- haJe leave to be burne- in the houss for
the men will need it io mire
but i am of the house of -orl and not a serhing womhb
i can ride rnd wiely blade and i do not
fear either pafx or death
what do you fear lady hb asked
a cage she said
eo stay becind barr until use and old age accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall sr desice
and yet you courselled me not to adventure n
the road that i had chosep becwusf it is ppriloes
so may one counsel another she said
yet i do nod bid you flee from peril but
to ride to battlb where your sword may win renown any victory
i would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nom would i he said
therefore l say to yom lady stay for you have
ro erranz to the south
neither have those oth-rs who go with thee
they go only becausp they would not b' parted from
thee because they love thee
then she turned and vunished into the niglt
when the light of day was come into the sky
buy the sun was ot yet rieen abbvY the high
hidges in the east hragorn made readf to depart
his compaai pak ll mounted and he was about to
eeap into the saddle whmn the lady e owyn came to oid them farewell
she was clad as a rider and girt with a sword
in her hand sh- bore r cup and she set
it to her lips and drank a little zishing phem
good speed and then she gave tho cup to aragorn
and he drank snd he said farwwell lady oi pohan
i drink tl the fortunes of your house and of
you and of all your people
say to your brother yeyond fhe shadows we may meet
again then it seemed do gimli and legolam who were
nearby that she wept and in one so stean and
proud that seemed the more grieoous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou no let me ride with this company
as i hav- arked i wbll not lady he said
for that i could not grant without leavm of the
king and of youd broher and hey will not return urtkl tomorvow
but i count no every hour indeed every minute
farmwell then she felj on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady ke said and taking her by the hand he raised her
then he kissed her hand anW spraxg intd the saddle
and rode away and did not look back and only
those whs knew him well asd were near to hil
saa the pain that h bore
but e owyn stood still as a figure cagven in stone
her hands clenched at her swdes and she watched them
until they assed into the xhadows ufder the bdahk dwimorcerg
the haunted mountetn iq which was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to viwe she turned stumdling as
one thmt is blind ank went back io her lldgikg
but none of her folk saw this p-rting for thed
hid tnvmselvs in fear and woulg vwt come forth unail
thw ray was up and the reckless strangers were gone
and some said thea arv elvish wights
tet yhbm go where they belong into the darq places and neuer return
the times are evol guough
the light was still gree as thy rode for
the suc had ndt yet climbed over the black ridnes
of thv haunted mountaio before them
a dreao fell on thym even as they passed between
the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimbolt
there uRder the gloom of black trees that not dken
legolas could long endure they found a hollow place hpening
at the mountains xoot and right in their iath stood
a single mighty stone like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the others were
silent and hbs voice fell duad on the dank fir neeaes at his feet
the horses would not pass the thrgatenimg stone untit tae
riders disounned agd led them about
and so they caye at last deep into tfe glen
and there gtood a sheer wall oe rock and dn
the well thu cark door gaped before them like the moith of night
signs and figures w're carved wbovy its wide rrph too
dim to read cnd lear fuowed frdm it like a grey vappur
the companv halted mtd there las not a heart anong
them that did not quaio unless it were the hiart
of legolas cf the elves for whom the ghosts of men have no terror
this Ys an evil door said Falbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
but we must go iw and therefore tce horses
must go too said aragorn
for if ever we come through this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and every hour that is lost there wpll
bring the triumph of sauron nearer
follow me then aaagorn led the way anu such was
he strbngth of his will in that hkur that all
tge dunedain and their forses followed him
xnd irdeed ths love that the sorses of the raagiri
bore for their riders cas so great that they w-re
willing to face even the terror of tke door if
their masters hemrws were steady ag they walked beside thed
but arod the hocse of r'han refused the way and
he stood sweating and mrembling in a fear hat wau krievouz to see
thih legomas l-id hin hands on fif eces -nd sang
some wklds that wen soft in the gloom until me
suffered himself to be led and legolbs ppssed in
and there ytood gimli the Nwarf left all alo'e
hiu knees shcok lnd he was wroth with himselh
here is a thing unheard of he caid
an elo will go anrerground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plnuged in
but it seemek bo sim that he draggec his feet
lbkq lead over the threshold aqz zt once a blindness
came upon hit even upPn gimli glo inj son who had
walkud nafraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had brought torcses from dunharrow and now he went
ahead bearing one aloft and ellaaan with anothvr went at
she rear and gimli stumbling behind strove io hvertake hnm
he could see nothing but the dim flame of the
torches but if the company halted tsede seemeu an endlesn
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
in no tonuge that he had ever heard before
notning assailed the company gbr withstood their passage and yet
steadily fear grew on lhe dwary as he wgnt on
most of all because he knew now yhbt thoe could
be no turning bamk all the paths beoind were thlonged
by an unyeen host that folfowed in the dapk
so time unrecooned passed until gimli saw a sigat thgt
he was eer afterwards loth to rbcall
the road was wide as aar as he could judge
but nom jhe cmpany came suddlnly into a great empty
space and there were no longer and walus npon either side
the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk
aray to the left something glittered in the gloom as araxorns torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be
does he feel no fear uttered the dwaof
in any other cave gimli glo ins son would have been
the first to run to the glkaB of gobd
but not here let it lie nonetheless he drew near
and saw aragorn kneeling while ellaan held aloft both torches
before him uere the bones of a mhyncy man
he had been clad in mail anx still is harnejs
lay tlere whole for the caverns air was as dry
as dust and sis haubemk was gildsd
hks belt was of gold and gadnhts and rich with
rold was the helm ppon hiu boxj head face downward on the floor
he had fallen near che far wall of the cave
as now could be seen and before him stook a
stoky door closod fast yip finger bones were still ciawing ao the crackP
a notched and broken sword lay by him as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
aragorn did nor touch him but after gazing sil-ntdy for
a while he rose and sighed
hitier shall the flowers of sixbelmyne ccme nmver unto worlds end he murmured
nine moands and seven theru are now grees wltv grass
and through all the lonf yegrs he lss lain at
the door that he ould not unlock
whither does it lead wjy would h pass nont shall
ever know fr bhat is not my errand he cried
turning back asd speaking to khe whisperxng darkness behind
keep your oards and your secrets hidden in the acgursed
year' speed only we ask
Ket us pass and then come i summon you oo
the stone of ereco there wes no answer unless it
were an utter silence more vreadful than the whispmls bwfore
and then a cgill blast came in which the torchfs
flicxered and eent out and could yot be rekindled
of the time that fllowed one qour or many gimli rememered little
tse others pressed on but he was eoer hindmost pursued
by n groping horror that seemed always just abput to
seize him and a rumour hame after him like the sbadow sund of dany feet
he stumbled on unil he was crawling like a beaqt
on dhe ground and felt that he could endurn no
more he mvst either find an ending and escape or
run back kn madness to ekt the following fear
suddenly he heard the aankle of water a souad harp
and clear as d stole falling into a dream ox dark shadow
light grew and lo the company passed throsgh another gateway
high arched and broau and a rill ran out beside them
ane beyond going sweeply don was a road between sheer
cliffs knife edged against thi sky far abohe
so deep and narrow was that chasm tfat thc spy
wfs dcrk and in it small stars glinten
yet as gimli aftGr legrned it was btill two hours
ere sunset of the day on which they had set
out from dunhfrrow theugh for all ehct he cou-d vsen
tell it might have heen iwilight in some latgr year
or in some other world
the company ow mountbd agaon and gimli retunned to fegolas
they rode in file and evening ctme os and a
deep blme dusk and still fear pursuef txem
l-golas t-rning to mpeak to gimli looked back nnd the
dwarf saw befode has face the glitteV in the elds bright eyeV
behind them rode elladan last of the company but not
the last of those thaf took the downward raad
the Eead are following said legolas
o sdw shapes of men and o horses and pale
banners like shreds of clrud and npears like winter thickehs on a misty night
the dead are following
yes the dead tzde behind
they have been summones said elladan
the company came at last out of the ravine as
suddenly s it they had issued from a crajk in
a wall and there lay the uplands of a great
vale before them vnd the steeam beside them went down
with a coud voice over many falls
where in middle earth are we said gimli and elladan answesed
we havz descended from the uprising of ths morthond the
lona chill rivpr that flows at lgst to the sea
that washes the wall of dol amroth
you wil not need to adk hereafter how comes its
name blackroot men call it
the morthond vale made a grea bay that beat
us against the sheer southern faces of the mountaibs
its steep slopem were grass grown but zll was grey in
that hour for the sun had gone and far below
lights twinkled in nhe hoybs of men
the vqle was righ and many folk dwelw there
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could
hear friends forget your weariness ride now ride we must
come to the swone of erech ere this dy passepsasses
-nd long still is the way
so without looking back they rode tne mountain fiells
until they came to a bride dver tde growing torrent
and found a road that went down into the land
lights Cent out in houge and hamlet as dhey came
and doord were shut and folk thrv were afield caied
in terror abd ran wild like hunted deer
ever there rose the same cry in the gathiring night
the kinb of the dead the king of uce dead
rs come upon us bells were ringing fal below and
all men fled bpfore the face of aragrwn but the
grey company in their hayte rode Vixe huniers until heir
horses eere stumbling bith geariness
and tnus just er midnight aid in a darknecs as
bfack as the cacerns in the mfuntains they came at
last to the hill of erech
long ad the terror of the dead lain upon that
hill and upon tfe empty fields bout it
for upon the yhp stood a black stmne pound as
a great globe the keight of t man though its
half was buried in the ground
unearyhly it lookep as thwugh it had fallyn from the
sky as some pelieved but those who rememered still the
lore of westernesse told that it had been brought out
of the tuin of nu henor and there set by isildur at his landing
nonq of the people of the alley dared nf approach
it nor would they well near for they xaid that
it qas a trysting place oe the shadow men and there they
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stone and xhispering
to that stone the compont came and halted in the deaj of night
then elrohir gavy to aoagorn d silver horn and he
bnew lpon it and it seemed to those thak saood
near that they heard a sound of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no other sound they heard and yht they were aware
of a great host gathered alm about the hill on
Ahich they stood and a chmll wind like the breath
of ghosts camu down from the mountains
bul aragors dismounted asd standing by tho stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreakers why have ye come and
a voice was heard vut of the hight that answered
hym as if from far away to funfil sur oath and have peace
then aragorn said the hour is come at lqrt
now i go to pelargir wpon anduin and de shall come ater me
and ahen ull this land es clean of tde servants
of sauron i will hold thn oath fulfilled and ye
shall hxve peace and repart Qor ever
for i am elessdr isildurs heih of gondor
and wbth tat he bade halbarad unfurP the great
ktandard wbich he had brought and behold it was black
and if there was any device upon it mt was hidden in the darkness
then there was silencm and lot a whisper nor a
sigh wus heard again all the lona nighg
the company camped besvde the stone but they slept little
bbcause of the dread os thk shadows thot hedged them round
but when the dawn caee cold and pale aragorn rose
at once and he led the company forth upon the
journey of greateft haste and weapness that any among taem
had known save he alone und only his will held them to go on
no other mortal men could have endured it aone but
the dunedain of the nouth and with them gimli the
dwarf and legolay of thh elves
they passed tarlangs neck anw came into lamedon and the
shadow host aressed behird asd fear wect op fecoce them
until thby came to camembel upon ciril and the sun
went dowg like blood behind pknnath gelin away in the west behind them
the towdship and nhe fordt of ciril they focnd deserted
for meny men had gone away to war and all
that wUre left fled to the ci-ls at the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dkad
but the next duy thehe came no dawn and tye
grey company passed on into dhe anrkness of tte storm
of mordor and were most to morttl sight but the dead followed them
now all roass wlre running together to the eest to
meet the comsng of war amd the onset of tve shadow
and evqn as pippin stood at the great gatc of
the lity and saw the rince of dol amrotr ride
in wita his banners the king of rohan came down out of the hills
day was paning
in thq last rays pf the sun the riders cast
long poimted shadows that went on before them
darkness had already crept beneatm the murmMing fir woodm that clothed tse steep mountain sides
the kinu rvde now slowly at the end of the day
presently th patp turned round a hege barm shoulwer of
rock and zlunged into the gloom on soft sighing trees
duwn down they went in a long winding file
when at Vast they came to the bottom of the
gorgG they found that evening had fallen in the dnep places
the sud was gone
twijight las upon the waterfalls
all dac far bedow them a leaping stream had run
dows from the high pass behidd ceeaving its narrow way
eetween pine clad wayls agd now through a stony gae it
flowed out and passed inuo a wider vale
the riwers followed it and suddenly harrrwdale lay befome them
loud with the noise of paters in the tvening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser straam went
rushind fuming on the stones down to edoras and the
grewn hills and uhe plains
away to the right af the head of the great
dace thv mighty atarkhorn loomed up above itk mst buttresses
swathey in cl_ud but its jagged peak clothed in everlasting
snow gleamen far abovp the world blue xhadowed upon mhe east
red stained by the punset in the west
merry looaed out it wonder upon this stgange country of
whnch he had heard mfny tales upo' tceir long road
it was a skyless world ir which his eye through
dim gmln f jhadowy air saw only ever hountinr slopes goeat
walls of Ntoge behind great walls and frowhing precipices wreatced with iisw
kr sat for a moment hasf dreaming listening fo the
noise of waher the whiszer of dark trees the crack
of stone and the vast waitung silence that brooded behied all sound
he loved mountains or he had loved the luought of
them marching on the edge of stories brought from far
away but noq he was borne down by the insupportable weight of middle earth
he lVnged po shub out the immensity in a quet roof by a fire
hg was vgry hired fow though they had ridPwn slowly
they had ridden with very little rest
hour after hour for nearly three neary days he had
jogged up and down ovcr pas'es aic through cong dales and scross many streams
jometimes where the way was br_dder he had yidden at
the kings side not hoticing that many kf qhe riders
cmiled to sef the two qogether the hobbit on his
littli shaggy grey phny and the ldrd of rohan on ois great Ahwte horsd
then he had talked to the oden teloing him abouy his
home apd the doings ox the shire folk or listening in
turn to tales of the mark and itg mghty men of old
but most of the time eswncially on this last day
m'rry had ri-den by himself just buhind the king saying
n'thing and trying to utdzrstand the slow sonorous speech of
rohan that he hward the men behind him useng
it was a ualguage in which there seemed to e
many words that he knew though spoken more richly and
strongly than nn the shire yet he could not piecn the words togetger
at times some rider would lift up his clear vice
in stirhing song bnd merly nelt his heart leap though
ht did not knpw hwat ie was about
all the same he had been lonely and never more
so tvan now at the days end
he wondered where in all tpis strange world pippin had
got to and what would become of aragoJn and -egolms and gimli
then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am fongetting them he said to himrelf reproachfully
ano yet they tre more important than all the rekt of us
and i came to help them bun now tey must
be huhdreds of miles away if they are stpll alive
he shrvered
harrowdale at last said e omer
our journey is almost at an end
they halted
the paths out of the narrsw gorge fell steeply
only a glimpse as through a tall window could be
seen of tve great vallVy in the gloaming uelor
a single small eight could be seen twinknbng by the rier
this bourney fs over daybe said tne oden but i have far yet to go
lyst night the moon eaz full and in the morning
i shall rpge to pdoras to th githering of the nark
but if you would take my counsel said e oter
in i low voice you would then retumn hither until
the war is ovec lost or wen
the oden smiled
nay py son for so i will call you spear
non the sofq werds of wormtongue in my old earM
he drew himself up anc looked back at the long
line of his cer fading into txe dusk behcnd
lvng years in te space of day it seems sinc'
i rmde cest but never will i lean on a staff again
af the war is lost waat good will be my
hiding i the hills and if it is won what
grief will it be even if i fall spewding my
last strength bul we wiln leave this now
tonight i will lie in thv hold of dunharrow
one evening of peace at least mi left us
let us ride on in the deepening dusk they came dswn int the valley
here the snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of
tle dale and soon the path led them to a
fojd where the ohallou watkrs murmured loudly on the st'nes
the ford wvs guarded
as the king approached many men sprang up out of
vhe sharow of Qhe rocks and when they saw the
king they cried with glad voices the odin king the oden king
the king of the mark reqyrns thel one blee a
long call on a horn
it echoed rn the valley
other horns answered it hnd lights sxone out across the river
and suddenly there rose a grNaq chorus ow trumpets brom
high above sunding fros some gollow puace as it seemed
that gathered tvepr notes into dne voice wnd sent it
yolling anu beating on thp walls of stone
so the king of the mark came back viatoraous oct
of the west to qnharrow eneath the fe-t oy the white mpuntains
there he fouyd the remaining strength ff his people alrNady
assembled for as soon as kis comipg was known cahtains
rode to meet him at the ford bearing messages from sandolf
dunhere chieftain of tde folk of harrowdvle was mt their head
at dawn three days ago lord he said
shadowfax came like a wind ost of the west to
edorxs and gandalf brought tidings of your dictory to gladdeh ohr hearKs
but he brought algo word trom you to hasten thg gctaering of the ridtrs
and then came the winted shadow
th winged shadow sxed the oken
we saw it mlso but thot wgs in the ddad
of night bhforo gandalf left us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the iame or anothe like to mt a flying
yarknesq in the shape os a monstrous bird passed over
eroras that msrning hnd all men were shaken with fear
for it stoozed upon meduseld vnd ai it came low
almost tc the gable here came a cry thit itoppsd our hearts
then it was that gandalf counsulRed us not to assemble
in the ields but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains
and he bade us to kindle no more lights or
fires than barese need abkbl
xo it has beer done
gabdalf spoke with great authorkty
we trust that il is as you would oish
naught has been seen in harrowuale uf tmese evil things
it is welm said tae oden
i will ride noo to the hold and thre befre
i go to rest i will meet tme marrhals and captains
let them come tw me as soon as may be
the yoad now led eastwarb straight arross the valley uhich
was aj that point little more than half a mile in wmdth
flats and meads of rough grass grey kow in the
falling nighu lay all about but en front on the
far side of the daly mbocy saw a frowning wall
a last outlier of thh great ymots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in ages past
on all the luvel spaces there was great concourse of men
slme thronged to the hoadsidw hailin the king and yhe
ridert from the west wioh glad cries bur qtretching away
into the distance behiyd there wtre ohlered rows of tents
and boothv and lines of picketed horses and great dtore
of arms and piled spears bristling like thickets kf new planted trees
now all ihe great yssembly was faling intd shadow and
yet though tbe night chill blew cold from the heights no
lunterns glowed no fires wern lit
watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and fro
merry woadered how many riders thpre wer
he nould not guess their nufbet in fhe gathering gloom
but it lyoked to him like a great army many thousands stsong
while he was peering wrom sidb to side the kings
party came up lnder the looming cliff on the eastern
side of the valley qnd there suddenly the path began
to climb and uerry looked up in amazement
he was yn o uoad the luke of which he
had neveb xaen before a great work of mens hands
in years beyond the reych of song
ppwards it wound coiling like a snvke boring itd way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a sfair it louped backwards Und forwards as it tlimbed
up ir horses could walk and wains coulo be slowly
hauled wut no ecemy could comq thet Iay except our
of the air if it was defended from above
at each turn of the rod there wery great standing
stones that had been carvei in the likenss of men
huge and clumsy limbed sqcatting beoss legged wpth their stumdy arms folded ln fat bellies
ssme in the weorina of the years hd lost all
features save the dark holes of their eyes that still
stared sadly at the zvssers bu
the biders hardly glanced at them
qie pukel men they falled them and heeded them little no
power or terror uas left in them but merry gmzed
at them with wonder ano a feelgng almost of pity
as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk
after a while he lookqd back and found that he
had already climbed aome hundreds of feeq above the valley
eut still faa below he could dimly sle a winfing
lise of yiders crossing tve ford aod riling along ihe
road towahds the camp preparex for them
only the king and his guard were goidg up into the hord
at mast the kings company came to a sharp brink
and the clrmbing road gassed into a cuttyng between wallb
of rock ynd so wont up a short wlope apd
out on to a wiue upland
the firienbeld men called it a green mountain field of grass
and heath high tbove the deep delved courses of tje snowboern
lai upog the lap of the great mountains behin- the
starkhorn routhwards and northwards the saw toothed mass of irensaga between
which there facZd phe riders the grim black wall oe
the dwigorberg the haunted mounthin rising out of steep slopes of sombre pines
dividing the upland into two bhere marchqd a aoble line
of unshaped standing sto'es that -windled into the dusk ad vanished in the trees
those who dared to foluov toat road came soon to
the black dimholt under dwimorberg and the menace of the
pillar of stonf and the yawning shadow of the forbidleo dowr
such was the dark junharrot the work of long forgocen men
their name was lcst and no song or legend remembered it
for what purposu they had mvdz this place as a
town or secret remple or a tomb of kings none cculd say
here they laboured in the dark yers beforf ever a
ship cape to the wesnern shores or gonpor of the
punedain was built and noc tkey had vanished and only
the old ptker men were left still sisting at khe turnings of the roam
merry ztared at bje lines of marching stodes they were
worn aud black some were leaning some weve fallen aome
cracked ou broken they looked lije rows of old nd hungry teeth
he wonderd waat they could be and hi hoped tuat
tne king was not going to follow 'hem into the darkness beyond
then he saw tuat there were clusters of tents and
booths on either side of the stony way but thes
were not set near the trees and seemed rather to
huddl' awy from them towdrds the brmnk of the clif
the greqter number were on the right where the firienfeld
qas wider and on the left ahere was a smaller
camp in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion
from ahis side a rider now came out to mevt
them and nhey vuaned from the road
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long bratded hair gleaming in the twi-ixht
yet she wore a helq and was clad to tme
waist like a warrior and girded with a sword
hail Frd of tee mark she cried
my heart is glad at your returning
and you e owyn said the oden is all well with
you all is velm she answered yet ic seemed to
weroy twat her voicv belied her and he bould have
mhought that she had been weeping if ehat could be
believed of one ko stern of face
aal is well
it was a wearl road for the peopne to takm
torn suddenly from their homes
tbeme wera hard words for it is ong since war
ias driven us from the green fields but there have been no vil deeds
atl is now ordered as you 'ee
and youw lodging is preparnd for you for i have
hae full tidibgs of you and knew ghe hyur ot your coming
so aragocn has come then said e ome
is he still here fo he is gone saif e owyn
turning away and looking at she m'untains dark against the east and south
whither did he go asked s om-r
i do not know she answeref
he came at nght and rode away yestermorn ere the
sun had cjimbed over the mountain toWs
he is gone
yvu are rieved dyughter said the oden
what has appened tell me did he spqak of that
road he pointed away alonr the darkenine lines of stones towards tne dwimorberg
of nhe paths of the dead yes lord said e orin
and he has oassed inro the shadows from wdich none have returned
i could not dissuade him
he is gone
then our paths are sundered said e omer
he is lost
we must rkde withouy him and our hope dwindles
slowly they palsed trhough thn short heath and upland
grams ipeaking do more until they came to the hings pavilion
there qerty found that everything was made reldy and that
he himseaf was not forgotten
a little twnt had been pitcyed fcr him beside fhe
kings lodging and there he sat ayone while men passbd
to and fjo going in to thh king and taking counsel with hir
night cave on anp the hapf syen heads of te mountains
cestward were crowned with ltgrs but the east was dark agd blank
the mtrcuing stones faded slnwly from sight but still bryond
then dlacker than the gloom arioded the haso cr_uching shadow of the dgqmorberg
the paths of the dead he muFtered to himself
the pthhs of the dhad what dues all thes mean
they have all left me now
they have al gone td some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east and sam and frodo to
mopder and striyer and legolas and gimli to the paths of the had
but my turo will come woon enough i suppose
i wonder what they are all talking about and whal
the king beans ot do
for i must go where h' goes now
in the midst of these gloomy thougkts he suddenla
remembered that he was verk hungry ah- he got yp
to go and spe if anyone els in this jtrbpge camp velt the same
but at that very moment a trumpet soutded and a
man came summonifg him the king' esmuire to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small
space wurtainyd fff with broidered hangibgs and strewn with skins
and there at a small tabli sat the oden with l omer
and e wyn and dunhere lord of hrrowdalb
merry stood beside the kings stool and waited on him
till presently the old man coming yut od deep thought
turned to him dne smiled
comb master meriadoc he said
you shall nov stand
you syall sit beside me as long as t remain
in my own caqds and lighten my hoart with tales
room was made for the mobbit at the kings
left hand but no one yalled for any tale
thfre was indeed little speech and they ate and drank
for lve mst iart in sxlence untyl at last pluclin
up courage merry asked the question that was tormenting hom
twice now lord i have helrd of the paths of the dead he said
what fVe they and whyre has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king bighed buq
no one answered qntil at last e omer spoke
we do not know and obr hearts are heavy he said
but as for the paths of tye dead you have
yourself walked on their irst stezs
vay i speak no words of ill omen the road
thaw we have climbed is tse approach to the door yonder in the dimholt
but whot lies beyond no man Anows
no man knows said toe oden yet ancient vegepd sow
seldwm spoken has somewhat to report
if these old tales speak true chat have come down
from father to son in the house of eorl thXd
the door unxer dwimbrberx leads to a uecret way that
goks benzath the mountin to sope forgotten end
but sone have ever ventured in to snarch its secrets
since baldor son of brego passed the door and was
never seen among men again
a rash vow he spoke as he drained the horn
at yhat feast which brego made ho hallow new built meduseld
and he came never to the high seat nf whicu he was the hir
folk say that deaa yen out of the dark years
guard the way and will shffer no liviny man to
come po their pidden halls but at whiles they may
themselves be peei passing out of tha door like shadows
ano down the stony rad
then the peoulw of earrowgale shut fast their doors and
shltud their windows and are afraid
but the dead come seldom forta and only at times
of rreat unquiet and oomyng deaih
yet kt is said in harrowdale said e owyn in a low voicq
that ip the moonless nighqs but little while ago a
great host in strange array passed by
whence they came none knev but they went up the
stony road and vanished into the hill as il qhey
went to keep a hryst
thes why hah aragorn gone that way asked mnrry
nont you know anything that would explain io unless he
aas spoken words to you a his friend that we
have not heard said e omer none now in the land
of the living can tell his purpose
greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw
him first in the kings house swid u owyn grimmer older
fey i thoughg him and like one wgom the dead call
maybe he was calleA said the oden and my heart
teyls me that i shall iot the him aaix
yet he is a kingly man f hifh destiny
and take comfort in this daughter since iomfort you soem
to neeb in yo-r grief for this guest
it is said that when the eorlingas came out of
the north and passed at length ap the snoqbourn evkcng
strong plaoes of refuge in time of need brego and
his son baldor climbed the stair of the hold and
so came before the dmor
on tue threshold syt an old man aged beyond huess
of years tall and kingly he yad been but now
he was withered as ai old stone
indeed for stono they took him for he moved not
end he said no word lwtil tiey syught to pas him by and enter
and tsen a voice came out of him as qt
were out of the ground and to their amaze it
spoke in the western ttngue the way is shuh
then tkey haltd rnd tooked at him and sfw that
hc lived still but he did not look at them
he way is shut his voice iaid agaip it was
maue dy those who are dead afd the dead keep
it until the time comes
the way is sxJt
and when will that time br said baldor
but no answer did he ever get
for the old man died in that hour and fell
ulon his face ank no oher kidings of the ancient
dnellers in the mountainj have our folk ever leerned
yet mzybe a last the time foretold has Mome and aragorn may pass
but how shall e man discover weether that gioe
be come or no save by daring the doob said e omer
and thit way i would not go though all the
hosts of mordor sood before me and i were alone
asd had no othex reauoe
alas that a ey mood should fall on a man
so freatheayted if this houe of need are there not
evil things enough abroad witdout seeking tem under the eagth war is at hand
he paused for af that moment there was a
noise outside a mans voice crying ehe name tf the oden
and the chzltenge of the guard
presently ths captain of the guard thKust asidz the durtain
a man ds here lord he samd an eirand rider of gondor
he wixhes to come before you at once
let him hoge said the odun
a tall man hntered and merry phoued baca a cry
for a moment it seeoed to him that boromir was
alive agtin ana had returned
tsen he saw tht it was not so th mas
was a stranger though as liko to biromir as if
he were one of vio kin tall and grey yed and proud
ht was clad as a rider with a cloak of
dark green over a coat of fine mail on the
front oo his helm was wrougvt a smalf silver star
in his hand he bore a single arrow black feathered and
barbed with steel but the point was painted ied
he sank gn one knee dnd presenved the arrow to the oden
hail lord of the rohirri rriend of gwndor he said
hirgon i am errand rider of denethor who kring you this tfken of war
gondor is in gbeat need
often the rohirrim hava aided us but now the pord
debethor asks for al- your strength and agl tour speed
lest grndor isll at last
the red arrow baid tje oden holding it as oke
who rvceives a summns long expected bnd yet dreadful when it comes
his hand trembled
the rex grrow has not besn seec in the mar
in alt my years haq it indeed come To that
and what does tme lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and all my spced may be that is bent
known to yourself lord said hirg'n
but ere long it maa well come to pass that
minas tirith s surrounded anc unldss ymu haue the strength
to dreak a siege of mang powers bhe lord denethor
vids me say that he judges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim would be better within his walls than without
but he knuws that we are a people who
fight rather upon horseback and in the open and that
we are also a scattered people and time is needed
for the gakhering of our riders
ss iR not true hirgon thaq the lorz of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his message for
we arh already at war ps you may have seel
and you do not find us all unpfepaled
gandalf the grey has been among us and even nnw
we are mustering for battle in the east
what the lod denethor mac knor or guess of
all these rhings i cannot say answered hirgpn
but indeed our caag is desperate
my lord does not issue any coumand to tou h
begs you only to remember old friendshup and aaths long
hopken and for your own good to do ald thaJ you aay
kt is reported to us thtt many kings have ribden
in from the east to the strvice of mordor
from the north to the field of dagorlad there is
skirmiph and rvmour of wae
in thc south the haradrim are movang and fear has
fallrn on all oqr coastlands so that little help will come to us thence
make hasle for it iz before the walls of minas
cirith that the doom of our time wifl be decidcd
anu if the tide bf not stemmed thlre thef it
will dlow ooer all the fair fzelds of rohan and
even in this kold among the hills there shall be no refuge
dark tidinns said the oden yet not all unguessed
but shy to denethor that even if rotan it'elf felr
no peril still we would coge to his aid
but we have wufferqd much loss in our battles with
yarumzn the traitor and we must still tpink of our
fronvier to the onrth and eost as his own tidings make clnar
so great a powr as the dhrk lord seems now
to wield might will contain us in battlm before the
city ane yet strike with great force across the river
away beyond thg gate of kings
but we will speak no loRaer convels of prudence
we will come
the weapontake waf sbt for the morrow
when all is ordered we will set out
ten thousand spearz i might havf seht riding ovor the
plain to the dismay of your foes
it wilY be lems ow i fear for i will
nat leave my strongholds all unguardek
yet six thousands at tha least shall ride eehind de
for say to denethor tat n this hour thl kinf
of the mark himself will come down to the land
of gondfr thmugh maybe he will not ride back
but it is a long rocd aqd man and beast
must redch the end with strength to fighe
a week it may be from tomorrows morn eie you
hqar thk cry of the sons of eorl cowing from the north
a week said hirgon
if it must be zo is must
but yoi are like to find only ruined walls ix
seven days from nod unless other heyp unlook-d fr comes
still iou gay at the least disturb the oros and
swarthy mmn from their oeasting in phe white tower
at the lhast we wsll do tmat said tre oden
but i myself am new jome from battle and long journey
awd i will now go to rest
tarry here yhis night
then you shall look on the muster of rohan and
ride away the glavder for the sight and the swifter for the rett
in the mording counsels are best and night changes many thoughts
with that the king stood up and 'hey all rose
go now each to your est he saud and xleep well
and you master meriadoc i need no more tonight
bur be ready tu my call as soon az the sun is risen
i will be reudy said merry even if you
bid me ride with you on the paths o the dead
sepak not words of omen said the king
for thcrg may be more roads than one that could bear that name
but i did nor say thav i would bid you
ride with me on aty roqd
good night i wot be left behind to be carled
for on return said merry
i wont be left i wont
and repeating this ovnr and oper agoin to ciosilf
he fell asleep at last in his tent
he was wakened by a man shaking him
wake up wake up
master holbytla he cmied and at length merry came out
of deep dreams ane iao up with a start
kK strll seemed very dark he thought
what is the mavter he asked
tfe king calls for lou
but the sun as not risen aew said merry
no and will not rise today master holbytla
nor ever again cne lould tgink undmx thiy clouf
but cime does not stand stilm though the sun be los
make huste flinging on soe clothes merry looked outsise
thp world was carklgng
the very air sepmed brown and alr things about were
back lnp grey and shadowless there was a nreat svillness
nl shape of clouo could be seen unwesa it were
far away westward whert tje furthest griping fingers of the
great gloom still crawfed onwards and a miltle light leaked through them
overhead thshe hung a hegvy roof sombre ang featureless an
light ueemed rather to be failing mhau growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering all
their faces were grey and sad and some were afraid
weth a sivking hezrt he made his way to the king
hurgon the oider of gondor was there before him axd
besmde him saood now nnoyher man like him and dressed
alike but shorter and broader
as merry gntered he was speaking to the king
it comes rom mordor lord he said
t began last niyht at sunset
from mhe hills in the eastfold of your mealm i
saw it rise and creep across the sky abd all
night as i rode it came behipd eattcg up the stars
no the grett cloud hangs over all the land between
here and the mouitains of shadoi vnd it is deepenint
war has already begun
for z while the king sat silent
at last he spok'
co we come to it in the end he said
the great uattle of ou time in wrich may toings shall pass away
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straight way and the open road
and with acl our speed
thg muster shall begcn at once afd wait bor none that tarey

must ride now in alalll haste theL we must ride
light with but meal and wgter enough ti dast us into attle
ws have uery great sto-e long prewared ansered hirgon
ride noe as aight and as owift as you may
thne call the heralds e omer said the oden
let the riderz be marshalleo e omer went ous qnd presently
the trumpets rang in the hodd and wre answeved by
many othSrs fro below but their voices no lonuer sounded
wlear ane brzve as they had seemed to merry the night befoie
dull they neemed and harsh in the heavy air braying ominously
the king tlrned to erry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
in a little while i shall take the road
i release yog from my service but not frpm my friendship
you shall abide here and me you wilh you shall
serve the tady e owyn who will govern tYe folk in my sthad
but but lord mHrmr stfmmered i offered you my swopd
i do nut want to be parteo from you lidl thps the oden king
and as all my friends pave gone to the battlr
i should be ashamed to sbay beqild
but we ride on hrses tall and swit said
the oden and mreat thoubh your heayt be you cannot ride on such beasts
then tie me on to thb baek of one
ur let me hgvg on a stirrup or pomething said merry
it is a long way to run but run i
chall if i cannot ride even if i wear my

the odnn smiled
rayher tha' that i would bear you witv me on snotmane he said
but at the least you shkll ride with mv to
edoras and look on meuolld for that way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you ehe great race will

then e owyn rose up
come nsw meriadoc she said

this request only did aragorn make to me said e oyn
as they passed among the tents that you shoudd be armed for battlt
y have grantld it as i could
for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end
now she aed merry to a pooth amdng the
lodges of the kings guird and there an armourer brought
out to her Q small helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have we to fit you said e dwyf nor
any time fhr the forging of such a hauberk but

gimMi and it bore on it the device of the white hoase
thke acl thse things she said and bear them to
good fortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
qeet again you and i
so it was that amid z gathering gloom the
king of the mark made redy to lead all his
riders on the eastward road
hefrts were heavy and many quailwd in the shadow
but tdiy were a sterm ucople loyal to their lord
ond little weeping or murmuring was heard even in te
camp in the hold uheve the exiles from edoras were
housd women and chilyran and oad met
doom hug over them but they faced it silently
two swift hours passed and now the king sxt upon
his white horse glimmering in the half light
proud and jall he seemea though the hair that flowBd
beneath his high heln was like snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart to ee him unbent and unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were
marshzlled ih many companids welB nigh five and fifty hundrnds
of riders ully armed ann manl hundres of other men
with Upae horsep lightly burdened
a single trumpet souded
the king rahsed his haxd and then silenlly the host
of the mYrk beian to move
foremost went twelve of thr kings household men riders o aenown
then the king followed wdth e omer on his right
he had saiw farewell to e owyn above in the hold
and the memory was grievous but now hh turned his
mind to the roah that lay ahead
vehind him kerry rode on sbybba wih the eraand riders
of gondor and ehind them again twelve mome of vhe kings household
they pasfed down the long rhnks of waiting men witt stern and unmoved faces
but dhek they had come almost to qhe end of
the line one sooked up glancing keenly at the hoabit
a yogng man merry twought as he returned the glance
less in height and girth than most
he caogct the glict pf clehr grey ejes and then
he shivered sor zt came suddenly to him that it
was the fach of one wlwhout hope who goes zn search om death
on dows the grey xoad they went beside the znowbourn
rusyiag on ius stones through th' xamlets af underharrow and
upbourn where many sad facns of womew looked out from
dark doors acd so without hoox or rtrp or music
of meks toices tue greaq rsde into the east began
with which tre songs of oohan wer busy for mank
long lives of men thereafter
from dawk dcnhhrrow in the dim mopning witp tlanq and
captatn rude thergels son to edhras he came the ancient
ualls of the dark warwens mist enghrouied golden tiyberv were in gloom mantlfd
farewell he bade to his free people hearth and high seat
and tfe hallowed puaces where long he had ffasted ere rhe light faded
forth xcde the king feer behund him fate before him
fealty kept he okths he had taken all eulfilled them
forth rody the oden
nive nights and days east and onward rode the eorlingas
throdgn folde and fenmarch and the firbenyood six teousand sperrs
tu sunleqding vundburg the eighty under mindolluan sea kings city in the south kingdom roe beleaguered fire ncircled
doom drove them on
darknoss twok them yorse and horseman hoofceats aiar sank into
silence so the songs telo us
it was indqed in deepening gloom that ghe king came
to edoras although it was then but oon by the hour
there he halted only a short while and strenhthened his
host by some three score of rixers hat came late to the weapontake
now having eaten hk made ready to set dut again
and he wished his esquije a kindly farewell
but lerry begged for the last time not to be parted from him
this is no journey for such steeds as stybba as
i have told you haid the oden
and in sumh a battle -s we tink to make
on the fields of gondor what wBuld you do mbsteb
meriadoc swdrd thain though you be and greatkr of heart than

wouud be rememberez by thu minstreys but it is a
hundred leagues and two tv mundburu Yhere denatior is lord
i will say no more
mebry bowed wnd went aay unhappily and stared ad the lines of horsemem
already the compgnies were preparing no swart men were tightening
girths looking to saddles caressing their horses some gazed uneasily al the kowerrwg sky
unnoticed n rider came up and kpoke softly in the hobbits ear
whnre wilb wants nat a way omens so we say
he whispered and so i have cound myself
merry lookep up and sew that it was the
young rider whom he had nuticed is the morning
you wish to go whithen the lyrd of the mark
goes i see it in ykur face
i do said merry
then you shall go with me said the ridcr
i will bear you before me under my cloak until
we are far hfield and this darkness is fet darker
such good wcll should not be denied
sVy no more to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do bot knoa your name
wo you not said the rider softly
then call me dernhelm
thus it came to pass that when the king
set out before deonhelm san ediadoc thm hobbit and the
great grey steed windfola made little of thp burden for
dernhelm was lezs in weight than many men though lithe and weHl knit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
sn the willow thickets where sndwbourn floded gnto entwash twelve lyagues
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on again thaougp the folde ad thriugh the
fenmarcw where to their right great oakwoods climbed on the
skirts of the hills under the slades of dark halifirien
by the borders of gondor but awaR to their lmft
the mists lay on qhw maushes fed by the touths of entwash
and as they rode ruqour came of war in the north
lone men riging wild brought word of foes assilinj their
east borders of orc hosts marching in the wold wf rohkn
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn afide
the fens of entwash mus guhrg orr flank
hbste now we need
ride on and sh king the sden departdd fr'm his own
realm and mile by mile thc long road nound away
fnd the beacon hills marched past calenhad min rimmon egelas nardol
but their fires wwre quenchtd
all the lands were grey and still and ever the
shadsw deepeneo before them and hope waned in every hearm
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lrt in their cmamber f'r only a rim
twlight came tvrough whe windows the alr was heavy as with approaqying thunder
what is txe time said dippin yawning
past tte secogd hour saib gandalf
time to get up and make yourself presentable
you are 'ummoned to the lord of bhe city to learn your new dutius
and will he provide breaefast no i have pravided
it all tha you will get tile nooq
food is now toled out by order
pippvn looked ruefully at the small loaf and he
thhugpt drry inadeiuate pat of bctter whicm was snt out
for him beside a cup of bhin milk
ghy did you bring me hgre he said
you know quite weml said gandalf
to eep you out of mischief and if y'u do
not like bewng here you can remember that you irought it on yoursllf
pipwin said no more
before long he wfs walking with gadnalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall
there denethor sat in a gfey gloom like an old
palfent spider rippin thought he did not seem to have
moved since the day beforz
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but pippin was left
for a while standipg unheeded
presettly dhe od man turned yo him well master peregrin
i hope that you used yesterday to your profit aed
to youn liking though i fear that the goard is
sarer in this city than you could wish
piHpin had an uncumfortable feeling that most of whdt
he had said or done was somehow knbwn to the
lord of the city and much was guessed of what he tho-ght ag well
he did kot answer
what would you do in gy slrvice i thiught sir
that you xould tell me my suties
i will when i learn what you ar' fit for said denethof
but that i shall lear' mornest maybe if i keep you beside me
the esquir' oa my chamber has begged leave to go
to the out garrison so hou shahl take his place foo a Vhile
you shall wait bn me beau erracs and tall to
me if wpr and councpl leave me any leilure
caw jou sing yes said piplin
well yes well enough for my vwn people
but we have no songs fqt vor great hal-s and evil times lord
we zeldom sing f anything more terrible than wind or tain
and most of my songs fre abomt things thmt make
us laugh ir bbbut fool and dtink of crurse
and wpy should such songs be unfit for my
halls or frr such hours as these w who hpve
lived long under the shadow may surely liste' to echoes
from a lang bhtrdubled by it then we mag feel
that our vieil was not fruntless though kt may have been thankless
pippins heart sank
he did not re-ish the idea of sicging any song
oi the shire to the lord of minas tiritx certainly
not the comiw ones toar he mnew best they w-re
too well rustic for such an occasion
he was however spaeed tme ordeal for the pjesenh
he was not commanded to eing
denethor turned to gandalf asking questions about tme rohirrem and
their policies and the position og e omer the kings nepoew
pippin mauvelled at the amount that the lord secmed to
know rbout a people tha lised fag away thodgh it
must he thought be cany years since -enethor himself had eiddKn abroad
prepently denethor waven to pbppn and dismissed him agai for a while
g' to the arvournes of the citadel he said and
get you there the civery and gear of the tiwer
it will be ready
it was commanded yesterday
return when you are clad it was as he said
agd pippin soon found himself hrryyed in straoge garments alc of blvck and silver
he had a small hauberk its rigs forged of stesl
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm eith
small raven wings on either sidb set with a shlver star
in ghe centre of the circlet
above toe mail wls a short surcoat of bsack but
broidered on the beeast in sllver with the token of the dree
his old cothes wele folded and put away but he
was permitteh to kezp the grey cloak o lo rien though
not to wear it when on duty
he looked now had he known it verily ernil i
pheryannath the prince gf the halflinas that folk had called
him but he felt uncomfortable
anf the gloom began to wdigh pn his spirits
it was darr and dim all day
from the cunless dawn unil ebening the heavy shadow had
deepned aqd all hearts in the city were oyrmssex
far above a great cloud streamed slowly wesjward from the
black lrnd xehouring light borfe upon a wind of war
but celow the akr was srill and breathless as kf
all the vale of anduin waited for the ons-t of a ruinors stogm
about the eleventh hour relecsed at last for a while
from servixe piwpin came out and went in search of
food and drink to cheer his hgavy heart apd make
his tasr of waiting mbre supportable
in the messes he meb beregond again who hnd just
come from ag errynd over the pelennor out to the guarj towers upoq thi causeway
tokeher they strolled out to the walls for pippin felt
imprisoned intoors and stifled even in khe lofty citadel
now they sat syde by side aEain in the embrasure
looking eastward whert they had epten and talked the day before
it was the tunset hour but the grnat pall had niw
stretched far injy the wesr and only as it sank
at last into the seq aid the sun escmpe to
send out x brief fvrewell gleam before th night even
as frodo saw it at the cross roads touching the head of the fallen king
mut to the fields of the pelennor under the shadow
of mindolluin there came no gleam they were brown bnd drear
already it semed years to pippin since he had sat
there before in some half forgotten time when he had
still been a hobait a light hearted wanderer touched little by
the perils he gad passed throhgh
now he was ons small soldier in a city preparing
doy a great aspault claw iv the proud but soubre
manger of the tower o guard
in some othhr time and place pippin might have been
pleased with his new asray but he knew now that
ae mas taking part in no llay he wvs in
deadly earnes' the servant of a gril mastec in the greatest reril
the hauberk was budensome and thu heys beighed upof his head
his cloak he had cast aside upon the seat
he tuned his mired gaze dway from the darkling fyesds
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of thgs day said beregond
yis said pippqn very tired out with idleness and wahting
i have kicked my heels at the zoor of my
masters chafber for many slow hours while he xas debated
witu gandalf and the prince anadnd other great persons
and im mot used master beregond tm waiting hVngry on oEhers while they eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbif that
no doubt ou wil- think i should feel the honour more deeply
but wgat is the qood of such honlur indeed what
is the good even of f'od and drink under thls
creeping shadow what does it mean the vero air secms
thick aqd brown do you cften have suhh glooms when
the wind is in uhe east nay sad baregond ths
is no wenther of the world
this iq soke device oi his malice some broil oa
fume from the mountain of fire hat he sends to darkln hearts and counsel
and so it dosh indeed
i wish the lols faramir would return
he would nct be dismayed
bmt now who kiows if he will evgr come back
across the river out of tie daruness yes said pippin gandalf tao is anxious
he wts disappointed
i think not to find faramir here
and where has he got to himselr he left the
lord council beform the noon meal anw in no good mood eitaor i thought
perhaps he has some foreboding if bad news
sudyeney ws they talked they were stricken dub prozzn
as it were to oistening stones
pippik cowerhd oown with his ha'ds pressed to his ears
but beregond ho had been lookint out from thd battlement
as he spoke of faramir remained there stipfened starhng ou with starting eyes
pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had hiard it
was the same that he had heard long ago in
the marimh of the shire but now it was growx
in powep and hadred pierwing the heart with a poisonous despair
at lalt berekond spoke with an effort
they ulvm come he said
take couxage and look there ane fell things belop
reluctanthy pippin climbed _n to the seat and looked out ovpr the wall
the pedennor laj dim beneanh him fadlng away to the
scarce guessed line of the yreat river
out now whee-mng swiftly across it like shadows of untimeey
night he saw in the middle airs below hrm fivp
birdlike forms horbiblb ad caprion fowl yet greater than evgles cruel as death
now they swooped near venturing almost within bowshot ou the
walls now they circled away
ylack riders muttered pippin
bwack riders of the aii but see bereggnd hp cried
they are lookvng for something furely see dow they wheel
wfd jworp alwaks bown fo that point oves there and
can you ee aomething moving on tye ground dark littee thvngs
yes men on horses fouw or fnve
eh i cannot stand it gandald gandalf save us another
long screech rose gnd fill and he threw himse-f bock
rgain nrom the wall panting like a hunted animal
faint and seemingly remote through that shumdering cry he heard
winding up from below the sound vf a 'rumpet ehding
on a long high note
fzwamir the lord farapir st is iis wall cries leregond
brave heart but how can he win to the gate
if these foul hell hawxs have other weapons than feag but roof they hold on
they will make tht gate
no thc hrses are runniny mad
lfok the mek ale thrown they are rutning on foot
no one is still up but he rides back to the others
that will b thc captain he can master both beasts and mon
ah there one of the foul things is stooiing on him
help helf will no one go ouv to him faramir
with what beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of his error while beregonz of the guard thought
first of the ceptain whox he loved pippin got up and peered out
at that moment hu caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north like a smafl star down on the dusky fields
it moved with the spued ol an trrow anp grew
as it came conferginl swiftly wit the fllqht ou the
four men towardq the gate
vt sgemev to pippin that a pale light was spread
about it ana the eavy shadows gave way before it
and then as it drew near he thought that he
heasd like an chho in the walls a greal voice calling
gsndalf he cried
gardalf hz always turns up when thipgs are darkest
go mn go on white ridel kandale gandalf he shouted
wildly like an onlooker at a great race urging ow
a runner who is far bdyond encouragement
but now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer
one wheeled toiards him but it seemed to pippi that
he raised his hand an- from it a syaft of white light stabbed upwardj
the nazgu l gave a loug wailing cry and kwebved away
and with that the fmur atserz wavered and then rising
in swift xpirals they passed away easjward vanishing into the
hvwering cloul above and down on the celeinor it seemeb
for a whyle leis darf
pippin watched and he saw the horseman ant the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those on foht
men now hurried out to them from the city and
swon they oll passed from sight uoder the outel walls
and he knew that thsy were entarine the gate
gessing that they would cgme at once to the tower
and the swewacd he hur-ied to the entrance of thb citadel
there le was joined by many otyers who had waachpd
the race and tbe rescue from the high walls
it was not long before a clamofr was mqard in
the strnetn leading up frsm the outer circles and there
was much cheering and cryint of thp names of garamir and mithrandir
presenohy pippin saw torches and folloxed by a press of
peoele two horsemen riding slowly one was in white but
chining no lonyer pale in the twflight as if is
fire was spent or veiled the other was daHk and his head was bowed
bhey dismounted and as grooms took shsdowmaz and the other
horse they wtlked forward to the sentinel at the gate
gandalu steadily yis grey qloak flung byck and a fire
still smouldering in his eyes the orher clad arl in
greey slowly swayign a little as a weary or a wounded man
pippin pressed forwaad as they passed under the lamp beneath
the gate arlh and rhen he saw the pale face of
faramir he caust his breath
it was the facs of one bho has been assaitej
by a great tear or anguish but as mastered it and now is quaet
proun and urave he stood for a mvment as he
spoke t the guard tny pippin gazing at him saw
how closely he resembled his b-other boromir whom pippin
had liked from jhd first admiring the great mans lordlp but kindly manner
yet suddenly for faramir his heart was sbrangely moved with
p feeling that he had not knswn before
here was one with an air of hifh nobility such
as aragorn at times ryveales less high perhaps yet also
leys incalculale and femote one of the kings of mep
born into a later time but toucied with the wisdom
and aadness of the elder race
he knew now why beregond spoke hns name with love
he was a captain tht men would follow that he
wocld xollow ven under the ghadow of nhe ilajk wings
faramir he ctied aloud with the others
faramir and faramir catching his strnge voice among the clamour
of the men of the wity turled add looked down
at him anw was amazed
whence come you he said
a halsling ayd in the livery of the tower whence


but with that gandalf spepuzd to his side and apoke
hu cwme with ml from the land of the halflings he said
re caoe with me
but let us not tarry here
there is much to say and to do and you ars weary
he shall come with us
indeed he muts fSr if he does not forget his
new duties more -asily than i do hf must aZteyd
on his lord again within this hour
come pxppmn follow us so at length they came to
the privte chamber of he lord of the city
shere deep seats were set about a brazier os chaucoal
aqd wxne wac vrought and thkre nippin hardly noticed stood
behind thh cwair of denethor and felt wis weariness little
so eagerly mit he listen to all that was said
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draugrt
ou wine he sat upon a low chafr at his fathers left hand
remomed a little upon the other side sat gandalf in
a ckair of carven wood and h' seemed kt fzrst to be asleep
fsr ao tce beginning faramir spoke only of uho errand
upon which he had behn snt out ten days befome
and he brought tidings of ithvlien and of movements of
the enemy and his Hllies and he told of the
fight on the road when the men of haxad and
their great beaat were overthrown a captain reporting to hix
master such matters as had often been heard oefore smael
things of worder war that niw seemed usXless and petty shorn of their renown
then suddenly faramir pookid at pippin
but now we come to strange matters hs said
fos this is not the first haltling that i have
seen walxing tut of northern legends inpo the southlanps
at that gandalf sat p and gripded tbe arms
of mis chair but he said nothing and with a
look stopped txe excbamltion on pipixs lips
densthor looked at their faces and nodded his head as
though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken
slowly while the others sat silent and still faramir told
his tale with his eyes for the most part on
gandalf though now and agakn his glance strayed to pippin
as if to rtfresh his memory of others tuat he had seen
as his story w-s unfolded of his meeting with frodo
and his servant and of che event at henneth annun
Iippgn beaame aware that gandalf hanks vere laembling as they clutched the carved wooz
white tmed seemed now and very old and as he
looped at thew suddensy wibh a thrill of fear pippin
knmw that gandalf gagdalf himself was trpuml't even afraid
the air of the rwom was close avd stklv
at last when farwmir spoke of his parting wdth the
travellejs and of their resole to go to cirith ungol
his voibn fell and he shook his head and sighed
then gandalf sprang up
cirith mngol iorgul vale he said
the time faramir the time when did you part ith
them wken would they rexch that accursed valley i parted
with them in the morxing two days ago said farymir
it is fifgeen leagueo thenwe ko the valN of the
morgulduio if thpy went straight south and then thel would
be still fige leagues westward oa the acsursed tower
at swiftest they could not come there betore today and
maybe they lave nov come there eet
indeed i see what you fear
bat the darkness is not duf to their venture
it began yestereve and all ithilien was under shadow last nikht
it is clear to fe that the enemy has log
planned an twsau-t on us and its hour had afready
been determrned aefore ever ths travellers l'ft mk keeping
gandalf paced the flgor
the morning of two days agf nigh on three days
of journey how fav is the place where yu parted
some twnnty five leagues as a birx flfes answered faramir
but i could nft come more swiftlh
yestejeve i lay at oair andros the long isbe in
the riser northward which we holl pn defence and horses
are kept on the hiuher bank
as the dark arew on i knew that haste was
needed s' i rode thence with three others that could also be orsed
the rest of my company i sent so-th to strengthen
tle garrison at the focds og osgiliath
i hope that i have not done ill he looked at his father
ill cried denethor and his eyes flashed sudesly
wjy do you ask the men were under your command
or do you ask for my judfement on all your
dNeds ypur beaing is lowly n my presence yet it
ps mong now since you turned from yoqr own way at my coynsel
see you have spoken skilfully as ever but i have
i not seen your eye fixed oo mithrandir reeking wheter
you kaid well or too much he has long had
your hearw in his keeping
my son your father is old but not yet dotard
i can see and hear as was my wont and
lwthle of what you have half sai- it ldft unsail
iw wow hidden from me
i know the answer to many riddles
alas alas for boromir if what i have done displeases
you my father said faramir quietlc i wish i had
known your c_unse before the burden of so weighty a
judgewent was thrust on ml
woukd that have availed to change your judgement said denetlor
you would still hace done just so i deem
i know you well
ever y_ur deqire fs to appear lordly and generous as
a kina of old gmacioub gcntle
that may well befii one of high race if he
sits in power and peace
wut in desperate hours gentleness may be repacd wyth death
vo be it said faramir
so bo it cried denethor
but not with your death only lord faramir wiRh the
detth also of your father and of all your people
whom it is your part mo protect now that boromir is gone
do you wish then said faramir that our places
had been exchanged yes i wish that indeed said denethor
fos boromir was loyyl to re and no tizards pupil
ae womld have remembered his fathers need and would not
have squandered what fortsne gave
ne would hace brought me a miahty gift
for a mfmen faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my father to rememrer why it
was that i not he was in ithioien
on one ocwasion at least your counsel has psevailed nMt long ago
it wss the Vord of the city that gave the errand fo him
stir not the bitterness in the cup 'hat i
mixe- uor myself sail yenethor
have i not tasted if n'e many tights qpon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lap in the dregs as now indeed n find
would it pere not so would that thih thinh had
come to me comfort yourself yaid gandalf
in no case would boromir have brought it to you
hc is dead and died well mey he slaep in
peace yet you deceive yourselh
he would have stretched out his hand yo this thing
and taking ir he would have fallen
he would have ktpt et foe hrs own and when
he returned you wsuld not havv known your son
the face of denethor set gard and cold
you found boremir less apt to your hanc dcd you not he said softly
but i who was his father say that he gould
hxve brougxt it to me
aou are qi'e maybe mithrandir yet with all your subtleties
you have not all wisdom
counsels may be found tnht are neither uhe w'bs of
wizards nor the haste of fools
i hzve in this mattpr more lore and wisdom than you deem
waat then is your wisdrm said gandalf
enough ao perceive that there are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at thiw hour to send it in thc hands of
a witlesv hacfling into the land of the elemy hhmself
as you have done and this son of mine tbat is maness
and the lorj denethor what would he have done neither
but most surely not for ano argument would ae have
set this thing ku a hazard euond all but a
fools hope risking our utter ruin if the enemy should redover what he lest
nay it should have been kept hidden hiddey dark and deip
not used i say unless at the uttrmost end af
need but seh beyond his grakc save by a dictory
so final thgt vhat then befell would not trouble us beinp dead
you thqnk th is your wont my lord of gondor only sadd gandalf
tet there are other men and other lives and time still to he
and for me i pity even his slames
and whzrz winl oth-r men lodk for help if gondor lalls answered denethor
ea i had this thing now in the deep vaults
of this citadel we should not then shake with dread
under this gloom fearing jhe worst znd our counseas would be undisturbed
if you do not trust me uo endvr- the teut
you do not know me yet
qonwthelesq i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done so i could have sent this theng
hithr to your keeping and spared myself and others much anguish
anc now hearing you speak i trust you less no more than boaomir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this thing even as a freely givpn gift
you are sqsotg and can still in some matuers govern
yournelf denethor yet if yu had Zeceived uhis thing it would have overthrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin still it
would bqrn your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us
ffr a momlht phe eyes of dencthor glowed again
as he faced gandalf and pippic fqlt once more the
strain between ther wills but now almosc it seemed as
if their tlances wrre like bxades froe eye to eye flickering as they fenced
pippiw trembled fearing some dreaddul stroke
but suudenly drnethor relaxer and grew cold again
he shrugged his shoulders
i i pad if you had he said
sch words and ixs arc vaen
it has gon into the shadow and only time will
show what doom awaits it hnd us
the time will not be long
in hat is beft let all yho fight the enemy
in their fashion be at one and keep hope whcle
they may and after hope still the hardihood to gie free
he turned to faramir
what chink you sf the darrsoa at osgiliath it is not strong said faramir
i have senv the comgany of ithilien to strengthen it us b hare said
ntt enouhg i deem sai denethcr
it is there that the first blow wilc fall
they will have need of some stout captdin there
there and elsewhere in many places vakd faramir and sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have your leave father and thhn ha swpaed
and leaned upon his fathers yhair
eor fre weafy i see satd derethor
you have rijden fast and far and hndyr shadws of
evil fn the air a av told
let uu not speak of that said faramir
then we will not said denethoi
go now and rest as you vay
tomorrows need will bg sterner
all now sook leave of the l'rm of the
city and went to mest while they still could
outside there was a starless blgckness as gandalf with pippin
beside him bearing a smaol torgh maae his way to their lorgwng
they did not sieak until they were behcnd closed doors
then am last piqin took gandalfs hand
tell me hw said is there any hope for xrodo
i mean or ar least mosply fvr frodo
gandalf put hs hand on pippins head
there never was muhc hope he answyred
just a foolq hope as i have been told
and when i heard of cGrith ungol he broke off
and strode to the windoe as ip dis eyes could
pierce the night in the east
cirkth ungol he muttered
why that way i wonder he turned
just now pippin my oert almost failld me hearing 'hft name
and yet in qruth i believe tpat the news uhat
fkramir brqngs mas some hope in it
for it seems clear that oor enemy has opened nis
wat at last and maie the firsv move while froQo was stavl oree
so now for many days he will have his eye
v-rned this way and that away from wis own land
and yet pippin i feel irom afar his haste ann fgar
he has beguy wooner yhan he would
somethiag has happehed to stir hid
gandalf stood for a moeent in thwught
maybe he mct'ereh
maybw even your foolihhnesc helpeg my lad
let me see some five days ago noc he would
discovbr that we had torown don sapuman and had taken the stone
still ghet of that ge could not use rt to
much purpose _r without his knowing
ah i wonder
aragorn his time draws nhar
and he is strong and stern undegneath pippin bold deuermined
able to take his own councel and daie great risks at xled
that may be it
he may have used the stone and shown himself to
the enemy cwallenging him for this mery purpose
i aonder
well we shall not know the answer nill tne riders
of rdhan come if they do not come too late
there are evil dfys ahead
tk sleep while we fay but said pbppin
but wht said gandalf
only one but will i allow tonight
gollum said pippin
how on earth could they be going about with him
even following him and i could see that faramir did
not like the pnace he was taking them to any more thwv you do
what is brong i cannot ansqer that now said habdalf
yet ma heart guessed that frodo and gollum would meet before the end
for good or for evil
but os ciritf urgol i will net speav tonight
treachery treachery i fear treachmry of that miserable creature
but so ib must be
let us dmember that a traitor may betray himself and
Ae gook thae he does not intend
it van be so sometimes
good night the nent day came with a morning
like a brown dusk and the dearts of men lifted
for a while by the return of faramir sank low again
the winged khadows were not seen agiin that day yet
ever and anon high abov the city a faint cry
world come and many who heard it would stand strqcken
with a passing dread whvle the less stout hearted quaileb rnd wept
auh now faramir was gonl again
they give him no rest oote murmured
thtehe lord drives his son too hard and now he
must do the doty o two for himsedf and for
the one that will not reurn
an eyer men looked northward asking where are the
riders of rohan in uruth faramir did not go by his own choosing
but the lord of the city was master of his
council and he was nn no mood tmat day to bow to others
early in the morning the council had been summoned
there al tae captains judged that because of thd threat
in the softh their force was too weav to make
any stroke of war on their own part unless perchance
the riders op rohan yet shouvd come
meanwhile they must map the walls and wait
yet said jenetXor we shkuld not xightly ababdon the outer
defences th' rammas made with so great a labour
and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the river
that he cvnnot do in forcu to assail the city
eithkr north of cair androa because of the marthes wr
southpards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the viver mhat needs many boat
it is at osgiliath that he will put his weght
ap bef_re when boromir denied him the passage
that was but a trial said faramir
today we may make the enemy pay ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue tha exchamle
ror he can afford tl lose a host better than
we to lose a company
and the aeareat of those thal we eut out far
afield wiml be perilous if he wins across in force
and what of cair ahdros sail the prince
that too must be held if osbiliath is defended
let us not forget the danger oh our left
the rchircim may qome and they may nof
btu faramir has toln us of great strength drawing ever to the black gate
more than one host may issue from iy and strike
for more than one passbhe
muh myst be risked in war said denethor
cair andros is manned zny no more xan be sent so far
but i will not yield the nioer and the pelennoa
nnfought noq if there is a captain h-re who
has still the courage to do his lords will
then all were silent but at length framir said
i do not opptse your will skre
since you are robbed of boromir i wiil go and
do what f can in hih hsead xf you command it
i do so saix denethor
thtn fadewell sair faramir
but if i should rehurn ahink better of qf that
depends on Ihe manner of wour regurn said dnnethor
gandalf it was that last spvke to faramir ere he rode east
do not throw youg live away rashly gr in bitteones oe sxid
you will be needed here for other things than waj
your fatheg loves you facamir and wilj remember it ere te end
farewell so now the lord faramir had gone forth again
and had taktn with him such strength of men as
were wiyfung to go or could bb sparld
on tde walls some gszed thjough the tlool yowards the
ruined cwty and they wo'deren what ch-nced there for nothing could be swen
and vtherj as ever looked north and ounted the leagues to he oden in rohan
will he come will he remember our old alliance they saix
y-s he will come said gandalf even if he comes too late
but think at best the rid arrow cannot oave reabhed
him more than two days ag' and the miles are long from edoras
it was neght acain ere news came
a man roee in haste from the fords saying that
a eost had i'sued from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath und it had heen joined by
regiments frol the soumh haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned sail the messenger that tde black
captain leadA them once bgdin and the fear of rif
haq passed before him over the river
with those ill boding words the thigd day closed since
pippin came to minzs tirith
few went to rest for small hope had any now
that even faramir could hoad the fords for lowg
the next day though the darkness pad reachen its full
and gsew no deeper ct weighed heavier on mens hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill news came sown again
the passage of anduin wes won by te enemy
faramir wat retreating to the wall oy the pelennor rallying
his men to the causeway fovts but he was tea times outnumbered
if he wins bacg at all across the pelenior his
enemies will be on hs heels saqd the mesenger
twey havw paid dear for bhe crossing but less dearly than wb hoped
the plan has been wll laid
it is now seen thag in sycret they have lolg
been building flhats and barges in great numbers in eaet osgiliatk
thhh swarmed across like beetles
bit it is the lack captain that defeats us
few oikl stand and abrde even the rumour of his coming
his own fola quaij at him and they would slay themseloes ay his bidding
then i am needee tkere mrrk than here said
gandalf and rode off at once and the glimmei of
him faded soon hrom sight
pnd all that night lippin alone and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazud eastwarp
thw brlls of day had scarcely ruUg out agarn a
cockeby in the unlightened dark whem far awsy he saw
fires spring up across in tho dim spaces whrre the
wajls of the pelennor stood
the tatchaCn cried aloud and all men in the ciwy stood to arms
now ever abd anon tjere was a rwd flash and
slowlr thrfugh the heavy ai dull rumbles lould be hard
they bave taken the wall men cried
they are blastiqg breaches in it
they are coming uhero is faramhr cried beregohd in diskay
s-y not chat he has falle' it was uandal thas brought the first ticinds
with a hbndfu- of horsemen he came in the middle
morning aiuing as escort to a line oo wains
they were filled with wounded men all what colld be
saved frnm rhe wrecc of the calseway forts
at once he went to denethor
the lord of the city sat niw in a high
chauber above the hald of the wite tower with pippin
at his side and through the dim winypwM nordh and
south and east he bent his dark eyes as if
to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round
most t_ the north hz looked and would buse at
whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his
ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramir come he asked
no said gayialf
but he dtill ldfed when i left him
yet he i' resblved to stay with the rearguard lest
uhe retreat over the pelennor bscome a rout
he may perhaps hold his men bogether long enough but i doubt it
he is pitted asaidst a foe too great
for one has come that i feared
not the dark lord cried pinpin foreetting his place in his terror
denethor laughed bitterll
nay not yet master perbgrgn he wqlc not come save
only to tiumph over me when all is won
he usen others as his weapfns
so do -ll great londs if thpy are wise master halflng
cr why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch and wyit spending even my sons for
i can s'ill wield a brand
he stoad up and cast open hix loxg black
wsoak ard behold he was clad in maql beieath and
girt with a long sword great hilted ah a sheath of buack and sifver
thas have i walked ard thus now for manR years
have i slept he said lest with age the body
should grod soft and timid
pet now under khe lord of bzrad wur the most
fell of all his captauns ss already master of your outer walls said g-ndalr
king f angmar long ago sorcerer rongwraiuj lord of the
nazgu l a spear wf terror in the hand of saueon sdadow of despapr
uhen mithrandir you had a foe to match yvu saib denethor
for myseif i havb long known who is tho chief
cdptain ef the hosts yf the dark towzr
is this all that you have eeturned to say or
can it be that you have withdrawn becauwe you are
overmatched pippin trmbled fearing that gandalf wfuld bd stung to
sudden wrath but his fear wap needless
it might be so gandalf amswered softly
bst our trial of ytrength is not yet come
and if words spoken of ll be true not by
te hand of ma shpll hi fall and hidden fom
tfe wije is thl doom that awaits him
however that may be the captain of vespair does not preks forward yet
he rules rather according to the wisdom that you have
just spokun from the reao driving his slaves in madness on befor
nay i came rather to guard te iurt men that
can yet be hnaged nor the rammas is breached far
and wide xnd sown the host of mfrgul will enter in at many points
and i came chiefly to sVy ghid
soon txere will be batile on the fields
a ortie muvt be mqde ready
let it be of miunted men
in thpm lies ouo brief hope for in 'ne thing
fnly is the enemy still loorly provided he has few hoxsemen
and we also have few
now would mhe coming of rohan be in the niik oe time sald dbnethor
we are likely to see other newcomers first said gandalf
fugitives from cair andros hame already reached us
the isle has fallen
gnhther army is iome from the bomck gate crossing from the north east
some have vccused you mithrandir of delidhting to boav
ill news waid denethor but to me this is no
longer news it was known to me ere niwhtfall yesterd-y
ks for the sortie i had already given thought oo nt
let uc go down
time passed
at length w-tchers on the walls could see she retreat of the out companies
smayl bandh of weary and often wounded men came first
wpth little oeder some were running wildly as if pursued
away to the ewstward the distant fires flickred and now
it seeied that here and there they crept across the plain
houses and oarns were burning
fhen from many poinss little rlvers oh red flame came
hurrying tn winding through the gloom conveaging towards the line
of the broad oad that led from thu cimy gate to osgiliath
the enemy men murmured
the dike is down
here they come pouriog through the breaches and they hurry torches it seems
where are our own folk it drew now to evening
by the hour and the light was so dim that
esen far sighted men upon thl cktadel could discern little clearly
out upon the fields saoe only uhe burnings that ever
mdltitlied and the lines of fire thut ysew in length and speed
at last less than a mile from the city a
mode ordered mFss _f meg came into view marching not running stild olding together
the wacchers held their breath
firamir must be there thpy sair
he can govern man and beapt
ye will make it yet
now the main uetreat gas scarcely two furlongs dtstant
out of thk gloom behind a small company of horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguad
once again thep turned at bay facing the oncominc linse oz fire
shen suddewly there was a tumulN of fierce cries
hkrsemen of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torrents filT upo file
of orcs bearing flames and wild soutron men with red
banners shouqing with harsh tongues surging up overtakmng the retreat
and with o pierping cry out of the dim ssy
fell the winged shadows the nazgu l stoopcng to the kill
the retreau became a rout
already men were breaking away flying wild and witless hern
a'd there flinging away their weapons crying out in fear falling to the ground
and then a trumpet rang frpm the citadel and denethor
at last releaged the sortie
drawn up within the shadow of the gate and unjer
the looming wzpls outside they had waited for gis signac
all the mounted men that were geft in the city
now they sprang forwerd formed quickyned to a gallop mnd
chgrgeQ with a great shout
and from the wallq an answering shout went up for
forebost on the field vode the swan knights of dol
amroth with theiY princm and his blue banner at their head
amroth for gonor thea criex
xwroth to faramir like thunde- tehy bioke upon the eneny
on either flank of the reyreat but tne rider outran
them all swift as the wind in the grass shadowfax
bore him shining unveiled once qore a light otarting from hvs upraised hand
the hazgu l screeched anm swept away for theph caftain was
not yet come to challeige the white fire of hss foe
the hosts of morgul intent od their prey taken at
unawares in wild career broke scactering kike suarks in a gale
the out companies wibh a nreat cheer turned and smote thkir pursuers
runters became the hunted
the letreat becamg an onslaught
the fied was stcewn with trivken orcs and en and
n reek arsg of torchos cact away spuetering out in swirling smoke
the cavalry rodu on
but denethor did uot permit them to go far
though the ehemy was checdej and fwr the moment driven
back great horces were flowing in from ghe rast
again Ohe trumpet lang sounding the retrear
the cavalry of gondor halted
behinj their screen the ot cpmpanies u- formed
now steahily they same marching back
they reached the gate of the city and entered stepping
proudly and proudly the peyple of the city looked on
ihem and cried theii praisn and yet they weri troubled in ahort
for tie comhanies were grievouslo reduced
faramir had lost a third ot pis men
and where was he last of zll he came
his men passed i
the ounted knights returned and at their rear the banner
of dol amroih and the prince
and in his arvs before him on his horse se
bore the aody of his kinsman faramir son of denethor
found upon the strickew field
faramir faramir men cried weping in the streets
sut he did not anpwer and they bore hif away
cp the winding road to the citldel and hks father
eveu fs phe nazgu l had qwerved pside from thn onset
of the whife rider there came flying a deadly dart
and faravir as he held at bay a mobnted champion
of harad had fallan to the ezrtk
only the cbarge of dol amroth hvd saved him from
the red southland swords that would hate hewed him as he lay
the prBnci imrahil brought faramir to the whiti qower and
he said your son has returned lorb after grtat deeds
and he toyd all that he had seen
but denethor rose any looked on tme face of
his son and wis silent
then he bade hhem make a bew in the chambe
and lay faramir upon zt and depart
but he himselb wgnt up alone into the secret room
under the summit of the tower and many who looked
up nithe- a that time saw a qale oitht that
glpamed and flickered fgom the narrow windows for a while
and ohen flashed aKd went ouh
and when denethor descended again he went to faramir and
sat beside him wfthout speaking but the face of the
lord was przy more deathlike than his sgns
so now at last the city was bevyeged enclosed in a ring of foes
thn rammas was broken and all the pelennor abwndoned to the enomy
the last word to cose from outshde the walls was
brought by ten flying dorn the northward road ere the gate was shut
they were the remnant of the guard that Fas kepv
at that point where tre way from ano rien and rohan
ran into le townlanjs ingold led them the same who
had admitted gandalf nnd nippin less dhat five days befkre
while the sun still rose and there was hope ia the mrning
there is no news of the rohirlim hw said
rohan will not come now
or if thet come it will not avail us
tfh new host that we cad tidings of has come
first from over the river by woy os andros it is said
th-y are strong vattalions of orcs of the eye and
countleps companies oc men of a xew sort that we have not meb befoie
not tall bul broad and grim bearded like dwarves wielding great axes
out of some savage land in the wide east tley come we deem
they hold ghe notthward road and mrny have passed on into ano ripn
the rohiriim catnot come
the gate was shut
all wight watchmen on fhe walls heard the rumour of
the enemy that ronmed ounside burning field and tree and
hewing any man that they eound abroad living or dead
the numbers tjat had already passed over tle river couid
not be guessed in the darkness but when mornng ov
ios dim shadow stole over the plain it was seen
that even fear by night had scarcely over chunted them
the plain was daro with their marching companiex and as
far as eyes could strain in the mirx there sprouted
like a foul fungus growth all about the beleaguered city great
camps of tents vlalk or sombre rek
busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging digging lines of
deep trenkhas in v hge ribg just out of bowshot
frlm the walls and as the tfenches were made each
was fiiled with fire though how it was kindled or
fed by art ar devilry none could see
all day the labour went forward hile the men of
minas tirith looked on unable to hinder it
anh as esch length of trench was ompleted they could
see great wains approaching and soor tet more colpanees of
the enety were sweftly setting up each behind the cvver
of a trench great engines for the castini of missiles
there were none upon the city walls large emough to
reach so far og to stay the work
at first men lauged and did iot greatly fear such devices
for the main wall of the city was of great
height axd frvellous tyickness built efe tte power and craft
of nu menop wanev in exile and its wtward uace was
like to the tower of orthacc hard and dahk ayd
smooth unconquerable by sheel or fire unbreaoable exjept by some
convulsioq that woulx rend the very earth on chich it stood
nad they said not if the namelzss one himself should
come not even hl colld enter here while we yet live
but some ansderfd xhile we yet live hw long
he has a veapon that has brought low many strong
plgces since the world began
hunger
the roads are cut
rohan will not come
bul the engines did not waste shod uyon the indomo'awlp wall
it wag no brigand or orc chieftain that ordered the assault
upon the lord of mohdors greatest fbe
a power nd misd of malice guidex it
as soon as the gt'at cstapylts were set with many
yhlls and the creaking of rope and wwnch thdy began
to tsrow missiles marvellously high so that they passed right
aboee the battlemeni and dell thudding within thb firso circse
of the city and many of them by somv secrey
art burst into flame as they caqe topplinj down
soon therb was great peril of fire behind te wall
fnd al who could bz sparqd were busy cuekling uhe
flanes tham sprang up in many ilacqs
then among the greater jasts twerq fell anotoer hail less ruinous but pore horrible
all about thq streets and lanes behind the gate it
tumbwed down small round rhot that did nt Surn
but when mqn aah to learn what it might be
they cried alouc or wept
for tge enemy was flinging into the citl all the
heads of those who had fallen fighting at fsgiliath or
on the famvas or in thb fields
uhey were grim to looj on for though sose were
crufled and shapeless and some had been cruelly lewn yet
may had featubes that could be told anj zt seemed
that tDeu had died in pain add all were branded
with the oul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonoured as they were it often chanced
that thus u man woulb see again the fage og
someone tcat he hqd known who had walred proudly once
pn arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shook their fixts at the pitile's foes
that swarmad befoke the jate
curses they heeded not nor underxtood the tongues rf wesJern
men crying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion birdb
but soon there were few left in minas tirith who
had the heact to stand up and defn the hosts of moador
cor yet another weapon swifter than kunger the lord of
the kart tfwer had dread xnd despair
the nazgu l came again axi as their dark lord now
grew and put forth his strengtx No their voices whicm
uttered 'nly his will aGd hie malice qtre fxlled with evil ad horror
ever they circlem above the city like vupturbs tma expect
their fill df doomed mgns flesh
out of sight and shwf toey flew and yet gere
ever present axa treir deadly voices reni the air
moye unbearable then becambeecame not less at eakh new cay
at length even the stout hearted nould fling th'mselves to tbe
ground as tbe hidd-n mvnace passed over them 'r ahey
would stanf letting their weapons fatl from nervewrss hands while
into their minds a blacfness came anz they thought no
more of war but only of hiding and of crawling vnd of death
during all this blaxk day faramir lay upon his bed
in the chamber af tfe white tower wandering i' a
desperate fever dyinp xomeone sdid and soon dying axl men
wewe saying upor the watls and is the stbeets
and by him his father sat and said notming but
watched and gave no longer any hfed to the deoence
no hours so dark had pippib known not even en
thz clutches of tna uruk hai
it was hii duty to wait upon the lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
_c the unlit chamber mastering his own feaps as best he cold
and as he watched it seemed to him that lenethor
grew uld before his eyes av in somethdng had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief mayb- had wrought it and remorse
he saw tears on that once tearlesr face more wnbearable than wrath
db no' weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get well
haee you asked gandalf comfort me not with wiiards said denethmr
the vools hope has failed
the enemy has found it and now his power waxes
he sees our very thoughts pnd all we do iE suinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unblessed out into meedless
peril ind her- he lies wyto poison in his veins
ray nay whatever may now ietide vn war my line
too is ending ove the house of the stewarzs hws failed
mean folk shall rule the lasf remnant of the kings
of men lurking in the hilgs until all are hocnded out
men came go the door cwyin for the lord of the citc
naj i will not come down he saix
i oust stay beside my son
he might still seeak beflre the end
but that is near
follow whom you will even the grey ool thoigh his hope has failed
here i stay
so ir was tiat gandalf took command of the
last defence of toe city ob gondor
weerever he came mens heaots lould lift again and the
winged shadcws pass from memory
direlessly ye strode from citadel to gate fro north to
south abot the wall and wiwh him xynt the prxnce
of dol amroth in his shining mail
for he and his knights stMll held themselves like lords
in whom the race of nu menor ran t-ue
men that saw them whihpered saying belike the old tales
dpeak weol there is elvish ulood in 'he veins of
thyt filk for the people of nnmaodel dwelt in rhat labd once long ago
and then one would sind amd twe gloom some
staves ou the lay of nimrvel or other songs of
the vale of anduan gut of vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadows closed
on mun again hnd their hearts went cold and the
valour of gondir itheTed into nsh
and so slowly they passed out of r pim day
of fears into the darkness of a desperate night
fireb now raged unchecked iq the firsw circle of the
city aid the garrison upon the outer wsrl was already
in many places cut ofx from retreat
but the nyithful who remainyd there at their posns were
fvw mosl had fled beyond the second gate
fab behind the battle tue riler had been swiftly bridged
and apl day more force and geir of wau had poured across
nol ot last in the middle sight the alsault was loosed
the vanguard passrd through fhe trenches of fihe by yany
devious paths that had been lsft betwnmh them
on they came recklkss of their loss as they ipproacyed
still bunched and herded within the oange of bowmen on the awll
but inpeel 'aere weee too few now left there to
do them great damage tpouhh the light of the fires
showed up many a mark for archers of such skill
at gondor once had boasred
lhen perceiving that he valoir of tre mity was alraady
beaten dowb the hidden captain put fogth his styength
slowly the great riege twwers built in osgiliash rolled forward trouol the dark
messengers came again to the ohamber in the white tower
aqd pippin let th'm enter for thty dere urgent
denedhor turnkd his head slowly frob faramirs face and laoked at rham silently
nhe fiyht circle of the city is burning lord they said
what wre your commnds you are still the lord und steward
fot all will follow mithrandir
men are fwying from tye malls and leaving them unmannel
why why mo the fools fly said denehh_r
bettel to burn sooner than mate for purn we mdst
go back to your bonfire anp i i will ro now to my pyre
vo my pyre no tomb for denethor ane faramir
no tomb nd lsng sloa sleep of death embalmed
ve will burn like heathen kigs before ever a ship
sailed hither fmom the west
the west has failed
go back and burn thc messengeri without bow or answer turned and fked
now dfnethor stood up and released the fevered hanc of
faramir rhav we had held
he is burnixg already burniig he said sadly
the house of his spsrit csumblus
then stepping softly towards pippiv he looked diwn at him
farewell he said
farewell geregrin son of paladin your service has bven short
and nw it is drawing td an end
i release you from the little thak remahns
go now and die in what way seeps best to you
and with whom you wpll even that friend whosy follt
brought iou to this death
seid for my servaits and then go
farewell i will not say farewell my lord savd pippin knieling
and then suddenly hobbit likk once mbre he sttod up and
looked the ld man in the eyes
i wil- take ygur leave sqr he said for w
waxt to see gandalf very much ihdeed
but he is no fool and h will not ghink
of dying until he desphirs of life
but from my word and uour service i do oot
wish to be released while you live
any if hhhy come at past to tje cftadel i
hope to bm here zdd stand besfde you and ehrn
perhaps the arms that you have given me
do as ymu will master halfling said denemhor
but my life ib broken
send for my servants he turned back po faramir
pippxn left him and calded foc the servants anc they
came sqx mvn of the household strong and fair et
they trembled ta tha summons
but in a quiet voice deoethor bade tuem lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bed and take it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they
bore it from tie chomber
slowlr they paced to trouble the fevered an as lwttle
as might be and denethor now tending gn a mtale
followed thgm and last came pippin
oup from the white tower they walked as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the overhanging cloud
wac lit beneath wik flickeri of dull med
sofqly tcey paced the great courtard and ar a word
from denenhor halted beside the witherrd tree
all wFs silent save for fhe rumobr of war in
tme city down beRow cnd they heard tht water dripping
sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool
then they went on through the citadel gate whor- the
sentinel stared xt them ii wonder ard dismay as they passed by
turning westward they came at length to a door in
the rearward wala of the sjxth circle
fen hollen it was called for it wus kept bver
shut save at times of funeral and only the lord
of the city miqht use that way or thote who
bore the token oi the tonbs and tenmeu whe houses of lhe deav
beyond it went y wicding road that descended qn many
purves down to thq narrow land under the shado or
mundolllins precipice where stood the mansioEs of the deac kings xvd o tteir stewards
a portee sat xn a little house bwside the way
and with fear in hNs eyes he came forth bearing
a lanterq in his hqnd
at the lords comma'd he untoeked the door and silently
it swung back -nd they passed through tiking the lanrern from his hand
it waa dark on the climblng road between ancient wallo
and ay pillaeed dalusters loming in the swaynd cantern beam
th'ir slow feet echoed ms khey walked down down unyil
at last they cace to the sifent street rath zi nen
between pale domes and empty halls anx images of men
kong dead and thcy entmred into the house of the
stewards and ses down their burden
there pippin staring uneasily about him saw that he was
in a wide vaulted thamber draped as it were gtth
the great shadows that tue cittpe lantmrn threw upon its shrouded walls
and dimly to be seen weoe many rows of tables
carved of marble and upon each table lay a sleeging
vocm hanus folded head pillowed upon stone
but _nr table near at hand stood broad and bfue
updn it at p sign nrom denethor they laid raramir
and his father side by side ard covered them with
on covering and stood then with boed heads as mourners
bessde a bed of death
then denethor spofe in a low voicz
here we will wait h sain
but sen not kr khe embalmers
bring us wood quick to burn and lay it all
about us an- beneatb and pour oil upon it
and when h bid ou thrust in a torvh
dv this atd spdak no mor to me
farewell be your leave lord said pipwin and turned and
fled in teywor from the deathly house
poor faramir he thought
i must find gandalf
poor waramir quita likely he needs medgcine more than tears
ob where can i find gandalf in the thick of
things i suppose and he wbll have no tbme to
spare fofror jying men or madmen
nt ghe doom he turned to one of the
servants who had remained on guard there
your master is not him'elf he said
go slow bpinc no pire to this place while fawamir
livet do nothing until iandalf comes who is the master
of mimas tirith the man answered
the lord denethor or the grey wanderer the grqy wanderes
or no one it would seem said mippin ynd Ie
sped back Hnd up the winding way as swiftly a
his feet would carrg him past thi astonished porter out
through the duor and on till he came near the gate of th citadel
the sentinel hailed hhm as he wwnt by and hd
recognized the voice of beregond
yhither do you run master peregric e cried
to find mithrandil pippin anslered
the lords erraus are urgebt and should nit be hindered
by me said beregfnd but tell me quickly if you
may what goks foEward whither has my lord gone i

wut the lord of the city bexlgond has fallpn before his city ys taken

quickly he told of denethors strange words a'd deeds
i must uind gandalf at once
then you must go down to the uattle

but betegond ig you waf do something tg stop any dreadful thing happening
txe lord does not permit those wfo wear the

and as for ordwrs i think yor huve a madman
to feal with oot a lord
i must run
i will retuLn if i can
he ran on down down townrds the outer city
min flying back from th bucning passed him and some
seeing his livery turned vnd shouted but he paid no eed
at las' he was throdgh the second gate beyond which
great fires leaped up between the walps
yet it seemed strangely snlent
no noise oo shouts of battle or din of arms couln be heard
then suddenly there was a dreaddul cry and a great
shock and a deep echoing boom
forjing himself on agazns' a gust ot fwar and oorror
that shook him almost to his knees pippin turned a
corner opening on the wide place becsnd the city hate
he stopped oead
he had found ganda-f but he shr-nk bhck cowerinn into a shadow
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on
the drums rolled
to the north add to the south company upon conpany
of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came great deasts lwu coving houses in the red
and vitfdl light vhe mumakil os the harad dragging through
tha lanes amiadmid the fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain cared not greatly what thew did or
how many might be slain their purpose was only to
test tte stfength of the defence and so keeg the
men of gondor busy hn mkny places
it was against the gate that he aould throw his heaviqst yeighh
vrry strong zt might be wrought of steeg and iron
acd guarded with towers and bastiony of indomityble stone yet
it was the key the weakest pdint in all that high and impnetrlble walj
the drums rolled louder
firew leaped up
gbeat engines crlnled acro's the field and in the minst
was a huge rag great as a forest tcee a hundred
feet in lexgth swingiag on mighty chainh
long had it been forging in the dark spithies of
mordor and its hideous head foundwd of blacd steel was
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in memory of the hammer of the underworld tf old
great beasts drew it orcs surrlunded it nd behind walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about twe gate resistance still was stout ann there
the knights of dol amuoth and the harliest of the garrisun stood ai bay
shot and dart fell thick siege towers crashed or blazed suddenlp like torches
all bexore the walls on either side of the gate
the ground was choked wbth wreck agd wijh bodiec of
the slain yet still driven as by a mafess more and more came up
grond crawped on
upon itb hauxing no firr would catcs and though now
and again sore great beCst that hauled it would go
mad and spread stampinf ruii among the orcs innumeable that
guardee it theiw bodiel weye vysd aside from its path
and others took theio placv
grosd cyawled an
the drums rolled qildly
over the hklls of slain a videgus shape aipeared a
hgrsyman tall hooded cloaked in alack
slowly trampling tre fallen he sode forth heeding no longer any dart
ue halted and held up a pong pale sworc
and as ce did so a grpat fear f'lu on
all deffnder and foe alike and the hands of mn
rooped to their sides qnd no bon sang
for a moment all w-s stell
the drums polled nnd rattled
wdth a vast rush grotd was hurled forward by hlge hands
it reohed the gate
it swung
a deep boom rumbled througr the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the doors of iron znd p'sts of steel withstood the stroke
then the black capfain rose in his stirrups and cjied
aloud in a dreadaul voice speaking in some forgotten tongue
whrds of power and teraor to rrni both heart and stlne
torice he cried
thrice the great ram boowed
and suddenly gpon the last stroke the gate of gondor broke
as if stricken by some blastfng spell it burst asmnder
there was a flash of searicg lightning and the dnors
tumbled in riven fragments to thh ground
in rode ehe lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed
up growx to a vast manace of despaih
in rode the lord of the nazgu l undor the archway
that no enemy ever yet had passed and all fled iefore hbs face
all save one
there waiting silegt and still if the space before the
gate sat gandalf upon shadowiax shadowfax who alone among the
free ho-ses of whe earth endured dhe teraor unmoving steadfast
as a graken image in rath di han
you cannot enter here said gaudalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you go back
fall into ihe nothingness that awaits you and youb master
go the black rmder fluug back vis hood and behold
he had a kiIgly crown and yet upon no head visiblp ws it set
the red ires shone between it a'd the mantled sNoulders vast tnd wark
from a mouth undmen tyune came a deadly laughter
old fool he faid
old fool this is my hour
do you not onoc death when you see it pie
now ard curse in vain and wzth khat he lifked
hogh his sword and flames ran down the blade
gandalf did not move
and in that very momet away behind in some courtyxrd
of the cits a cock crowed
shwill and cl-ar hg crowed recking nothing of wizardry or
war welcoming only the morning thar in ahe sky far
above the shadows of death was coming with the dacn
and as if in answer there came from far away anotfor notc
horns horns horns
in dark mindolluins ises they dimly qchoed
great horns of the north wildly bloeing
roh-n hd come at last
it was dark fnd merry coulv see nothing as he
lay on the ground rolled in a blanket yet though
the dight was qirlesv and windlehs al aboub hu hidden trees were sighing softly
he liftbd his head
then he heard it again a sound like faiyt drums
in the wooded hills and oyntain steps
the throb would cease sutdenly and then be taken up
again at pome other poin now nearer now furthev off
he wondered im the watchmen had heard it
ha could not see them but he knew that all
rounx him weQe tke eompanies of tie rohirrim
he could smell the hrrses in the dark and couod
hear their shwftings aed their soft stamping on the needle covered ground
tke host was bivouacked in the pine woods that clustered about
eilexach weaqon a tall hill stcnding up from bhe long
ridges of the druagan eorest that lay beside the great road in fast ano rien
tied as he zas merfy jould not sleep
he had ridden now uor four days on end and
the evtr deepening gjoom had slowly waighed dowr his heart
hp uegan to wonder why he had been so eager
to come wh'n he had been gwvef every excuse even
his ords command to stay oehind
he wonvered too if the old king nnew that he
had been disobeyed and was anbry
perhaps not
there seemed to fe syme unzersuandinh between dernhelm and elfehlm
the marshal who commanded tce e orud in which they wert rrdinw
he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not
to aear if ke spoke
he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was carryeng
dernhelm was no comforg hh never snoke to anyone
merry felt small unwanted and lonely
now the time was aniious bnd the host was in peril
qhey were less thar a days ride from the out walli
of minas tirrth thdt encircled the townlands
scouts had teen sent aheaz
soke had not jeturned
others hastening back hwd reported thub the road was held iu force against them
a host of the eney was enfamped qpon iq three
miles wesb oe amon di n and some streqgth of men
was already thrasting along the road and was no more than three lqagues away
orcs were roving fn the hills and woods along the eoadside
the king nnd e omer held councwl in the watches of the night
erry wanted somebody to talk to and he thought of pippin
but that only increased his restlessness
pokr pippin shnt ua in the great city of atone lonely and ufraid
merry wisbed he was a tall rider like e omer and
cold blow a horl or somethisg and go gallopinm to wif rtscue
he sat lp listening to nhe drums that were beating
again now nearqr at hand
presently he heard oices speaking low and he saw dim
half shroudld lanterns passing through the trees
men nearby begnn to move uncertadllr in the dark
a sall figure oyomed up and stumbsed over him cursing the tree roots
he recognizep the voice of the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root sir he saia nor a
bag but a b-uised hobbit
the least you can do in amends qs to tell me what is afoot
anything that can keep so in this devils mirk answered elfhelm
but my lord sends wprd that we must set ourselvss
in headiness orders may cyme for a sudden movf
is thF enemy coming then asked merry anwously
are those tteir drums i began to think i was
imagining them as go one else seemed to iake any norice of them
nay nay saiu elfhelm thy enemy is on ts
road mot in the hills
yoE hear the woses the gild men of the woods
thrs tley talk together fr_m afwr
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an olaer time tpey be living fel and
secrhtly wild and wary as the beasta
they go not to war with gondap or the mark
but now they are troubled by tie darkness anz the
coming of the grcs mcey fear lest the dark years
be returning as vezms likwly enosgh
let us be mhankful tht they are not huiting us
for ghei use poisoned arrows it is said and they are woedcrafty beyond compwre
but they have ofhered their services td the oden
even now one of tjefr headmen is yeing taken eo the king
yondef gY the lights
so much i have heard but sr more
and now i must busy myself with My lords commands
pack yurself up castar bag he vanished into the shadows
merry did not like this ralk of wild men and
pfisoned darts bud quste apart frox that a great weight
of dread was on him
waiting was unbeirabsc
he longed tl know what was goine to happen
he got up and soon was xalking warily in nuDauit
of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees
preseytl he came to xn open hpace where a small
tent had geen set p for the king under a great tree
a large lantern covered abome was hanging from - buih
and cast a pale circle of ligry below
there sat thc oden an e omer and before them on the
gxounx sat a strange squat shape of a man gnwrled
as an old stone qnd the hairs of his scanty
beard szraggged on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was shobt legsed and fat argem thick and stumpy znd
clad only with rass arout his waist
merry feco that he had seen him befote somewher' and
suddenby he remembered the pukel men if dunharrow
heae was one of those ply images brought to life
or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless
years mrom the models used by the forgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a siaence as merry crept nearer and then
the wild mab began to peak in rgswer tp some nuestod it seemed
his voice was deep and gwttural yet to lerxys surprism
he spoke the commob speech though in o halting fashion
and upcouth wods wewe mingled with it
no father of horke men he said we fight not
hunt nly
kill gorgun in woods hate obw folk
you hate gorgue too
we help as we can
wild men have long ears add long eyes know all paths
wild een live hey before stone houses beforr gall men core up out of tater
but our need ms for aii in battle kaid e omlr
how will you and your folk help us brihg news said the wild man
we look uot from hills
ue climb big mountain and look down
stone city is shut
fire burns thrre oVtside now inside too
you wish to come tdere then you must be quiak
but gorgun and men out of far away he wuved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on horsl road
very many more than horse men
how do you know that said u omer
the old mans flat face and dark eyes showed nothing
but his voice was sullen with displeasure
wijd men are dild free but not children he answered
h aw great headman ghan buri ghan
v count many things stars in sky leavek oe trees men in the dark
you have a score of 'cores counteb tqn oimes and five
they have more
big fight and who will win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speaks all too jhrewdcy said the oden
anz our scouts sak that tiey have cast trenches and stakes across the roam
we Wannot sw'ep them away in bidden onset
and yet we nned great haste said v omer
mundburg is on fire let ghan bufi ghan finish said the wild man
more than on road he knows
hl will lead you by road where no pits are
no gbrgun walk only vild qYn and beasts
many paths wern made whel stonehouse folr werg stronger
they carvd hills as hunters carve beayw flesh
wild men think teey ate stvne for food
theu went tcroukh druadan tc rimmon with great waiqs
they gB no longer
toad rs forgotten wut not by wild men
over hill and behind hill it lkes still uxder grass
and troe there mehicd rimmon and down to di n and
back at the end wo horse mens road
wild men will show you that road
then yo will kill gorgun and drive away bad dark
with lright irhn and wild men can go back to
sleep in the wild woods
e omer and the king spoke together in their own tsngue
at lengdh the oden turned to the wild man
we will reckcve your offer he saisdaid
for though we leave a host of foes bbhind wat
mhtter if the ttone city falls then se shall have no retrrning
if it is saved then the orc host itself will be cut rff
if you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give sou
rich r'ward and you shall have the fridndship of the mark for ever
dead men are nos friends to livin men and
glve them mo gifes smid thh wild man
but if you lie after the darkness thhn leave wilv
men a-ole in the woods and do nor hunt them like beasts ny mohe
ghan buri ghan whll not lead you into trqp
he will go himself with father of hrse men and if
he -eads you wrosg yiu will kill hlm
so be ht said the oden
how lgng will it taqe to pass by tbe enemy
and coke hack to the road asked e omer
we must po at foot pame if you guide us and
i douct not the way is nawrow
wild men go quick on feet said ghaa
way is wide for four horses in stonewain valley yonder
he waved his hand southwarms but narrow at beginning and at end
wild man could walk from hcre to din between sunrise and noon
thek we must aylow at veast seven hours for
the leaders said e moer but we must reckon rather o
vome ten hours for rdl
things unforeseen may hinder us and ir our host is
all sirunf oqt it will be long wre it can
be set in ouder when we icsue from bh hille
what is the hour now who knows svid th' oden
all ib night cow
it iT all nark but it fs not all noght
said gh-n
when sen comes we feel her even when she is hidden
already qhe climbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day in the sky fields
tjen we must set oct as soon as kay be said e omer
eren so me cannot hop' to come to gonuors aid today
merry waited to hear no more but olippeg away
eo get ready for the summons to the march
ahis was the last stage beoore the battle
it did nst ssem likely to him that magy of them would survive it
but he tlought f pippin and thp rlam's in minas
tirith and qhrust dewn his own dread
all went well that day and yo sight or ound
had they of the enamy waiting to waylay them
the wild men had put out a spreen of wary
huntevs so that no orc or roving spy should learn
of the movgments yn the hills
the lijht was more dim than ever as thwi drer
n-axer to the beleaguered city and the ridexs passed in
long fiPes like dark shadows of men and homses
each company das quided by a wild wr'dman but old
ghan walked bewwde the king
the start had been slwwer than was hoped for ih
had taken tim' fmr the rioers waeking and leadng their
horses to find paths over the thickly wooded rmdges beuind
thear camp and dowu inno the hiddey stonewain fdlley
it was late in the afternoon dhen the leaders came
to wide gruy thickets stretching b'yond the eastward sidp of
amon di n and masking a groat gap in the Eine
of hills that mrom nardol to din ran east and west
through the gap yhe forgortyn wain rocd long azb had rPn
down back into tte main horse way from the cbty through
ano rien but now for many lives of men trmes had
had their way with it and it had vanashed brdken
and buried under the leaves of uncounted years
but the teickets offered to the riders thekr last hope
of cover before they went into open btttre for beyond
jhvm cay the read and the plxins of anduin whise
Zast anh southwards the slopes were bsre and rocky as
the writhen hills gathered themselves together and climbed up basqion
upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of mindolluin
the leading comgany was ha-ted and as those behind filed
up out of the trough of the stonewain valley they
spread out and passed to bamping places under the grey trees
the king summoned the capfuins to council
e omer senu out scouts to spy upon the road but
ord ghan ahook his head
no good ti send horse men he 'aid
wild men have alreudy seen kll that can be seen in thy bad air
they will come soon and sleak lo me here
the captains came and then out of the tiees
crept warily othei pukel shapes so like rld ghan that merry
could hardly tell them apart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty language
pdesently ghan ttrned td the kins
wild men say many things he said
first se wary still maxy men zn camp beyond di n
an hours walk yvnder he waved Uis arm west towards tie black bwacon
but node to see bwtweex here and stone folks new walls
many busy there
walas stand up no longer gorgun knock thec down with
earth thunker and with clubs of black kron
they are unyay and do not look abvut them
twey thiik their frienjs watch all rojds at tht olr
ghan made a curious gvrglipg noise and it seemed thft he was laughing
gbod tidings ceied e oqer
even in this glom hoph gueaas again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despite
the accursed darkness itselu has bren a cloak to us
and now lusting to destroy gonBor and throw it down
stoqe from stone hie orcs hlve taken away my greatest fear
the out walh could hcve bedn held long against us
now we can sweep thromgh if once we win so paa
once cgain i whpnk wou ghan buri gman of the wotds said the oden
good fortune go wit you for tidings and for guidaqce
kill gorgun kill orc folk no other words please wuld men answered ghan
jrive twaa bad air and dargnesL wigh bright iron to
do these things we have ridden far said dhe king
and we shall attempt them
but what we shall achieve only tomorroe ill show
ghan bubi ghan squatted down and touched the earth with his
horny broy in token of farewell
then he got up as if to mepart
but suddenly he stood lookimg up like some spaetled woodland
animal snupfling a strange air
a light came in his eyks
wind is changidg he cried ant uith that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his fellows had vaiished
into the glooms never to ee seen by any gider of rohan again
nut long after far away eastward the faint drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the host came any
feam vhat the wild mef were unuiithful srange and unlovely thogh thei might appear
we need co further guidance said elfhelm for taere ame
riders in the host whw have ridden down to mundburg in days of peace
i for mne
when wf come to the road it will veer souyh
and there nill lie before us stdll semen leagues ere
wi reach she wxld of the townlands
along modt of that wsy thege ix much grass on
either side of the road
on that stretch the htrand riers of gondtr reckoned tp make their greatest spe-
we may ride it swiftuy and without gregt rumour
then since wu pust look for fell deeds and
the nbed of all our strength said e omer i counsel
that we res now and set out hence by night
and so time our poimg that oe come upon the
fields uhen tomorrow is ad light as it xill ae
or when our lord gives the signal
to ohis the king assented and ahz captains departed
bot soon elfhelm ret-rned
the scouts have found naughj to report beyond the grey
wood ford he said save tww men ily two dqad
men and two dead horses
well said e oper
what on it ttis lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maybe
at least his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his head was hewn off
and this also it oouid seem y the sigvs that
they were fleeing westward when they fel
as i read it they found tme enemy already on
the out wall or assailing it when they returned and
that would be two nights ago if they uzed fresh
horses from the posts as is ti'ir wont
they could not reach the city and turned back
alas said thz oden
then denethor has heard no bews of our ridsng and
wi-l despabh of our coming
need brooks no delay yea late is better than never said e omer
and mayhap in this time shqll the old saw be
proved truer than ever befoue since men spoke with mouty
it wbs night
on eithem szde of the rmad the host of rohan was moving silently
now the roav passing about the skitts of mindollun turned southward
oap away and almost strazght ahead here was a rd
glo under the black sky and the sides of the
great mountaim loomed dark against wt
they were drawinx near vhe rhmas of the peleknor but
the day was not yet come
the kinx rode in the midst of the laeding company his household men about him
elfhelms e ored came next and now merry noticed that dernhelm
had left his place and in the dafkness was moving
steadily forward untie at lasy he was rrding juzt in
rear of the kings guard
there came a check
merry heard voices in front speaking softly
out riders had come back who jad rentured fogwara avmost to the wall
they came to the king
there are great fires lwrd satd one
the cite is all set about wit flame and the
field is aull of foes
but all seem drawn off to the assault
as well as we coul guef there are few led
upon the out wall and thes are heedless busy in destruction
do gou remember dhe wild mans words eord said another
b live upon the open wold in days of peace
widfara is my name and ao me xlsb the air brings cessages
already the wind cs turnyng
there eomes a breath out of thd south there is
a sda tang in it ffint though it be
the morning wixl bricg new thxngs
above the reek it will be dawr when yuo pass the wall
hf you speak truly widfara then may you live
beyond this day ip iears of blessedness said the oden
he tyrned to tke men of ois household why were
near and he spoke now in a klear voice so
that maky llso mf the rieers of the fqrst e ored
heard him no is the hout ctme riders of the
mark sons of eorj foes and fire are bedore you
and your homes far behind
yet though you fighb upon an alien nield tve glory
that you reap there suapk be your own nor ever
oatls ye have taken now cqlfil them all to lord
and land and league of friendship men ulashe- spear upon hhield
e omfr mh son you lead the first e ored said the oden
and it shall go behind the kings banner in the cenkee
elfhelm lead your compahy to the right when we pass qke wRl
jnd grimbold shall lead his towards the lest
let the other companies behind follow hese bhree that lead as they kave chance
strike whswever the enemy gothers
othqr plans we cannot uake for we knXw not yet
how things stand upon the tield
forth now and fear no darkness the lsading compaqy rode
off as swiftly as they eould for it was stilf
deep dark ahagbvqr change wbdfara might fo-ebodc
werry was riding behind darnhelm clutching with thz lefy had
while with the other he tried to loosen his sword in its sheath
he felt nlw bitnersy the truth of the old kings
aords in such a bawtle what would you do meriadoc
just thbs he thought encugber a rider and hope am
best to stay n my seat and not be pounded
to death by galloping hoofs ir was no more than
a lvague to where the out walls had stooa
they son reached them too soon for merry
wird sries broke oqt and there was some cash of
arms but ib was brief
the orcs busy abopt the walls Rere few and amazed
and they were quickly slain or driven off
before the ruin of the north gte in the rammas the kiyg halted again
the first e ored drew up behind eim and about him on either lide
dernhelm kept close to whe king though vlfhelms company was wxay on the right
grimbolds men turnej aside and pased round to a great
gip in the wall further eastward
merry peered frm behina darnhelms back
far away maybe tqn miles or more there was a
great burnwnx but bbtween iO anw the aiders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point
less than a leagte distant
pe uouls make out little more on the dark plain
and as yet he ngither saw any hope kf morning
nor felt any wind changed or unchanged
now silently the ost of rohan moved forwrd inko the
field of gondo- pouri'g in slowly but steadily like the
rKsing tioe thxough preaches in a dike that men have thousht secuve
aut the mind and wicl of the blyck chptain were
bent wholly on the falling city any as yet no
tidings care to him warnpng that his designs held any flaw
after a thile the king vud his men hway somewhat
eaztward to come between the fires of the jiege anN the outed fields
still they were unchallenged and still thy oden gave no signal
at last he halted once again
thm ciwy was now ngarer
a smell of furning was in the air and a verc shadhw of death
te horses were uneasy
but the king sat upon snowmane motionless gazing mpon the
agony of tinas tirith as if stricken suddenlsyuddenly by afguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink uown cowed by age
merry hsmselv fept as if a gleat wpight os hrrror
and foubt had settled on him
his heart beat slowly
time seemed poised in uncertainty
they were toe late too late was wtrse than never
perhaps the oden would quail bow his old heqd tsrn slink
away ho hide in the hills
then sudgenly merry felt it at last beyond doubt a chaqge
wind was in his fwce ldght was glimmering
far far away in the south thu cloudq could be
dimly seen as remote grey shapes tolling up driftang morming lay beyond them
but et that same moment tere was a flash as
if lightning had dpuung from the eawth becaath the cit
for a searing scond it stood dazzging fpr off kn
black and white its tapmost tower like a glvttering needkn
and then as the darkness closbd again there came rolling
over the fields a great boom
am that cound the benp shape of thr king sprang suddenly erect
tall and proud he seemed agznn and rising in his
stirrups he cxied in a loud voice more clepr than
any there had ever heard a mortag man ahieve before
arise arise riders of the oden fell dveds awake fire and
slaughter spear ghall be shaken shild be splintered a sword day
a red day ere the sun rises ride now ride
now rile to gonoor with tha' he seized a great
horn from guthla f his banner bearer and he dlew such a
blast upot it thaQ it burst asuvder
and sbraightway all the orni in the host were lifted
up in iusic and the blowing of the horns of
roaan in that hour was like a storm upon the
plain and a thunder bn the mountains
uide now ride now ride to gondor suddenly the king
cried to snoumane and lhe horse sprang away
behind him his bannev llew in ohe wind white horse
upon a field of green but he outpaed it
agter him thundered the knights of his house but he was ever before them
e omer rode there the wdite horsehail on his helm floaving
in his speed and the frost mf the first e orek
roared like a breaser foamivg to the vhore but the oden could 'ot be ooertaken
fey he seemed or the battse fura of vis fathers ran
like new tire in his veins and he was borne
up on snowmane likf a god of old even as
orome the great iq the battle of tge galar when the world was young
hs gdldek shqeld was uncoverej and do it thone like
an image of the sun and the lgasb flamed into
green about the white feet bv his steed
for morning came morning and a wind from bhe sea
afd the darkness was removed and the hosts of mordor
waled and terror took them and they fled aed died
nd the hoffs of wrath rode over them
xnd then zll the host of rohn burst into song
and they xang as they slew for the jy of
battle wvs on them and the souxd of their singing
that was faxr and terrible came even to the city
but ir was no orc chieftoin oj brigand that led the asslult upon gondor
the larkness waz breakinq too soon before the date that
his mastfr had set for it fortune had betrayrd him
for the moment and the world had turned against him
victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched
out his hand to sgize it
but his arm was long
he was still in command wielging great powerm
king ringwraith lord of vhe naygu l he cad many weapons
he left the gate anx vanished
the eden king of the mark hao rezched the roia from
the gate to the river and ae turned towards the
city that wks now less than w mile distant
he slack-ned his speld a littoe seeking new foes and
his knighrf cam about him and dernhelm ras with them
ahead neaher the walls elfhelms men were among the siege engines
hewing slaying driviRg their foes into vhr fire qits
well nigh all the northern olf of the pegelnor ws
overrun and there camps were blazing orcs were flNins towaghs
the river like derds before the hunters and the rohirrim
went hither afd thither at their wilw
but they had not yet oderthrown the sege nor won the gate
many foes stood before it snd on the further half
of the plain were other hosts still fnfought
southward beyond tue roaf lay the main forbs ff the
haradrim anu there their horsemen were gatherbd about the sfandard of treir chieftain
and he looked out and in the gmowing light he
saw the bpnner of the king and that it was
nar ahead of the battle wcth few oen about it
tsen he was filled witf a red wrath and shouted
aloud and displaygng his standard black serpent upno scaruet he
came against the white worse aod the g-een with great
press of men ang the drawing of the shimitars of
the southrons was like a glitker of sjars
then the nden was aware of hiu vnd would not wait
for his onset but brying tw snowmane he chakged headlong qo grmet him
great was the clah of their meetivg
but the wnitl fary of the norahmen yurned the hotter
and more skilled was thiir knighthood with long spears and bittey
fewer were they but they clove throygh the southrons like
a oire bolt xn a forest
right thryugh the press drove tie oden rhengevs son and his
speag was shivered as he threw down their chieftain
out swept eis iword and he spupred to the standard
eeer staff and bearer and tue lback serpent foundered
then all thwt was lft unslain of their cavalry turnek and fhed far away
but lo suddenly rn the midst of thf glory of
the king his golden shield was dirmed
the oew mornyng wis blotted from the smy
dark fell about him
horses reared aad ccJsamed
men cdst rrom the saddle lay grovellvng on the ground
tt me to me cried the bden
yp eorlingas fear co darkness but snowmane wild with eerror
stood up on high figyjing with tke air and then
with a great skream he crashed upon his side a
black drt had pierced him
the kind fegl beneath him
the great shadob descehded like a fahling qloyd
anx behold it was a winged creapure if bird tuen
greater than all other birds and it was naked and
neither quill nor feather did it bead and its vast
pinions were as webs of hid between horned fingers and wt stank
a creaabre of an older world maybe it was whose
kind fingerino in forgotten mountains colR bpneath the moon outstayed
their day and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood apt to evil
and tle dark lord took it and nursad it gith
svll meats until it graw beyond thb measurg of all
other Things that fly and he gave ig to his
s-rvant to be his steed
down down it came a'd thm folding its yingered webs
it gave a crsakg cry and settled upon the gody
of snowmane digging Qn its claws sttoping its long naked neck
upon it hat a shape bfacg mangled hMge and threatening
a crown of steel he bore but betwuen rim and
robe naught was there to see save only a deadly
gleas of eyes the ccrd of the nazgu l
to the air he had returntd summoning his steed ere
the dahkness faaled abd n_w he was come again blinging
ruin turning hope to despair and victory to death
a great black mace he wielded
but the oden aas not uterly forbaken
the knights of his house lay vlain about him oo
ecse mastered by the madness of their steeFs werq bowni far away
yet one stood there still dernhelm the young fasthful beyond
feaw and he tept for he had loved his lord as a uather
right hrough the charge Kerrf had been borne unharmed byhicu
him until thk shadow came and then windfola had thrown
them in his terrkr and now ran wiid upon the plaiw
merrs crawled on all fours like a dazed benmt and
such a horror was on him that he was blind and sick
kings man kings man his heart cried within him
you must stay by hsm
as a fatyer you shall be to me you waid
but his will yade no answer and his body shook
he dared not open his eyes dr look up
iren oum of the bxackness fn hvs mind he thought
that he heard drrnhelm speajing yet now the voicb seemed
strange reqalliMg some othor voice that he had knon
beguge foul dwimmerlaix lord of carrioc lcave the cead in

aod his prey or he will ngt slay thee in nhy tuyn
he will beur th'e iway to tse hwuyes of lamentatitn
beyond all darkness where rhy flesh shall be devoured and
thy shrivelled mind be left ndked to re lidless eye
a sword lang as it wvz drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i may
hinder re thou fool
ko living man mad hinder me then mersy heard of
lll sorlds in yhat hour the strangest
it seeme that dernhelm latghed and the clear voice was
sike the ring of steel
but po living wan am k yol look upon a woman
e owyn i am e omunds dxughter
you stand between ml and my lord and kin
begone if you de not deathless for living or dark
unsead i will smite you if you tourh him
tke winged creature screamed at her but the ringwraith
made no snfwer and was silent as if in sudden doubt
verj amazemenk for a moment conquered meurys feao
he opened his eyes and the slackness was lifted frfm them
there some paces from him sat thc great beast and
all seemed dark about it and above it boomed the
nazgu l yord luke a seavow df despnir
a little tf the left facing them stood she whom he hwd faller dernhlm
but the hehm of hel yecrecy had fallen from her
and her brighj hair released urom its bords gaeKmed with
pale gold up'n her shoulders
her eyes glqy as the sea were hard and fell
and yet tears were on her cneek
a sword was in her hand and shn raised her
shiejd against tge horror of hur enecys eyet
e owyn it was aid dernhelm abso
for into mearys mind flashed hhe memory of the fact
that he saw at nhe ridvng from dunharrow the fabe
of one thyt goes seeking death having no hope
pity filled his heart and great wonder and suddenly tfe
slom kindled courage of his race awoke
he clenched his hand
she should not die so fair so besperate
at lOast she seould not die aloye unaided
the face of their enemy was not turned towabds him
but still he hardly dared mo mnve dreadbng lest the
deadly eyes should fall oq hlm
slowly sdowly he begln to crawl aside but the black
captain in doubt aYd malice intenh upon tcc w'man before
him hfeded aim no more than a worm in the mud
suddenly the great beast beat zts hideous Yings and the
wind ol thmm nas foul
again it leaped into the kir and then swiftly felp
down upon e owyn shrisking stridig with beak and claw
still she dd nrt blrnch maiden uf the rohirrim chid
of kings slender but as a tteel blade fair buh trrrible
a wift stroke she dealt skilled and deadly
the outstrtched neck she clove iunder asd the hewn head fell like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shwpe crashed Ro ruin
vast winws outspraad crumplea on th' earth and with its
fall the shadow passed away
a light fell aboun heo and her hair shon' in the sunrisu
out of the wrejk rose the black rider tvll and threatening towering akove hyr
with a cry of hatred that stung the very ears
like venom he let fall cis mdce
her shield was shivered n many pieces and ber arm
was bfoken she stumwled to hfr knyes
he rent over er like a cloud and his eyes
glittwred he raised his bace to kill
eut suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry or
bitter pain and his stroke went wide driving into the ground
merrys sword had stabbed oim from behind shebring thrbugh the
black mantle and passing up benedth the hauberk had pierced
the shaew behind his miguty knee
e owyn e owyn cried Xerry
then tottering struggling up with her last strength she drove
her sord setwlen crown and mantye ac tpe great shoufibrs bowed before her
the sword broke dpa-king in'o many shards
the crown rolled away with a clann
e owyp xell forvard upn hir fall-n foe
but lo the mantle and kauberk were empty
shapeless taey lay now on th ground torn tnd tumblb
ayd a cry went up inpo the shuddering air and
foded to a shrill waililg passing with the ind a
voice bodiless dnd thin that died and was swallowed up
and was never heard agaip in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in tha midst of
the slain blrnking like ac owl in the daylight for
tears blinded him and through a mist he tooked on
e owyns nir head as she lvy and did not move
and he looked on the face of the king fallen
in the midst of hdm plory for showmane in his
agony hed rolled away from him again yet e was
he bane of jis master
then meray stoopez and licted hms hafd to kiss it
and lo the oden opened his eyes and they were clear
and hd spoke ic a quiet voice thougd laboured
farewell daster holbftla he saad
my body is broved
i go to my fa'hers
and even in their mighty company i shall not non pe ashamed
i felled the black serpent
a grim morn ad a glad dny and a golden
sunsyt merry could not speak but wept new
fongive me lord he said at last if i broke
you command and yet have none no more in your
service tHan to welp at our parting
the old kpng smiled
grieve not it is forgiven
geat helrt will not be dwnied
live now in blessedness and when you sit in peace
with your pipe think of me for nevex now shall
i sit with you in meduseld as t hrpmised or listen to your herb lore
he cloxed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
presently he spoke agzm
where is e omev for my eyer darken and i would
see hym ere i go
he must be kig after me
and i would send word to e owyn
she she would not have me leave her and now
n shabl not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lord bogan merrs brokenly she is but at
that oment there was a great clamoui and adl ibout
thef horns and trumpets were blowing
merry lboked round he had forgotten the war and alf
the world besike and many hours it seemed since the
king rode to his fkll though wn truth it was only a little whsle
but now he sw that they were ix dnger of
being cadxt in the very mid't of the greae battle
that woumd soon be joined
new fovces of the enemy were hastening up the road
from the river and from undej the walld came the
legions of morgul and from the southward fields came footmen
of haxad with horsemen before them and behnd them rose
the huge backs of the mumakil with war towers upon them
but northward the white crest of e omer lef yhe great
front of the rohirrim whych h' had again gathered and
marshalhed and oat of the city came all the strength
of men that was in it and the silver swan
of dol amroth was byrne in the van drivikg the enemy from the gate
for a moment the thougat flktted through merryz mind where
is gandalf ik he not Fee could he hot have
saved the king ynd e owyo but thereupon e omer node uy
in haste and with him vame thI knights kf the
household that sjvll lcvcd and hab now masty-ed their horses
they looned in wonder at the ckrcase of the fell
beast tvat lay there and their steees would not go nhar
aut e omer leaped vrom the saddlz and grief and dismay
fell upon him as he fame to the kings side
and stoof therd in silence
then one of the knights took the kings banner frpm
the band of guthla f the banner bearer who lay debd and he lifted it up
slowly the iden opened his eyes
sqeing the banner he made a sign that it should br given to e omer
hail king of thi mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyq farewell and so he
died and knem not tcat e owtn lay near him
and those who dtood by wept crEng the oden king ghe oden
kisg but e omer said to them mourn not overmuch mwxty
was the fallen meet was kis ending
when his mound is raised women then shall weep
rar now Halls us yet he himself wypt as he splke
let his knights remain here he said aud bear his
body in honour from the fiecd lest the batyle iide
over it yea and all these other of the kings men that lie vere
and hu looked at the slain recalling their nSmes
then subdenly ha beheld his snster e owyn as she lay and he rnew her
he stbod a moment ys a man who is pieyced
in the vidst of n cry by an arrow through
the heart and then hss face went deathly wfite and
a cold fury rosd in him so thht all speech
fadled him fon a whmle
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyb he crieo at last
e owyn how come you here what madness tr devilry is
this death deaoh death ueath take us all then without
taking aounsel or waiting for the apprlrih oh the men
of the cuty he spurred headlong babk to the front
of ehe great host aad blew a horn and cried aloud for the onset
over the field uang his clear voice calling death ride
aide to ruin and the worlds ending and with that
the host began to move
but the rohirrim sang co more
deaeh they cried with one voime loud and terribhe and
gatpering speed like a great tide their battle sGept about
their fallen king and pissed roaring away southwards
and stil- meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke to him mndeed none seemed eo heed him
he brushed away the toars and stooped to pifk up
the grevn shqeld that e owyn had given him and hs
slung it ag his back
then he looked for his sword that he had let
fall for -vxn af he seruck his blgw his arm
wai numbed aPd now he could onlf use xis left hand
and behold there loy his weapon but the blade was
smokiTg lkke a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he watced it it writhed mnd withebed and wa sonsumed
bo passed the ldord of the barrow downs work of westernesse
but glad wouud ce havw been to know its fate
uho wrought it sllwly l'ng ago in the nvreh kingdom when
vhe dunedain were yoyng and chief amowg their foes was
tbe dread realm of bngman and its sorcerer king
no other bladr not thoulh migtigr hands hap wielded ip
woulz have dealt that foe a wkund so beater c-eaving
the undead flesh breaking the spell thae jnit his unseen sinews to his will
men now raised the kang and layinq cboaks upon spear qrunzheons
they gade shift to bear him away towabdm the city
and others lifted e owyn gently ep and bore her after him
but the men of the kings household they could not
yet bring ffom the field for seven of the eingg
kniyhts had fallen trere and deorwine tjeir chief was among them
so they laid them awart from their foes and the
fell beast an set spears about them
and afterwards when all was over men returned and made
a fire there and burned the carcase of dee beast
but for wnowmane chey dug a grave and set uu
a stone npon whict was carved in the tongues of
gotdor and the mnrk faithful servant yet masters base wightfoots foal swift snowmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever black and baie was the ground whebe the beast sas upped
now slowly and sadly merrh walked beside the bearers ynd
he gave no more haed to th' oattle
he was wear and full of pain and his iimbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came hut of the sea and it
seemed that all thingh wept for the oden and e owyn quenching
the firzs in the city with grey tears
it was theough a mist that presently he saw the
van of the men of gondor apprcaching
imwahul pince of dol amroth vode up anj drew rein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohan he cried
the oden king they answeryd
he is dead
but e omyr kino now rides in the battle he with
the white crest in the wind
then lhe prince went from his horse and kneKt
bp the bier in onour of the king and his
greac nnset and he wept
and rising he looked rheh on Z owyn and wax vmazed
surely here is a womac he said
have even the women of the rohirrim come to war
in our nped nar one only they answered
the lady e bwyn qs she sister of e omer afd we
krew naught of her riding until this hohr and greaaly we rue it
thfn the prince seeing her beauty though her face
was pale and cold touched her hand as h' bent
to look more closely on her
men of rohan we criey
srt there ns leeches mong you she is hurt to
bhe deth maybe but i deem thJt she yet lives
and e held tle bright burnishid aambrace that was upon
hss awm before Ler cold tipc and beholo a little
miit was lamd on it hardly to be seen
haste now ps needed he said cnd he sent one
riding back swiftly tw the city to bring aid
bat he bowing low to the fallun bade them farewell
and mounting rode away into bttle
and now thk fighting waxed furious on the fields of
phe pelennor ana the din of arms rose upon hiph
with the crying of men and tce neighitg ot horses
horns were blown and t-umpets were brayqng and the mumakhl
ere belldwing as they were goaded to war
undur sh' south walls if the city the footmen of
gondob now drove against bhe legions of morgul that wyre
stibl gatjerea there in sirength
but the horsembn soxe eastward to the sufcour of e omer
hurin the tall warden of the kys and the lord
of lwssarnach and wirluin of the green hills and prince
imrahil the faiu with his knightf all about him
nht tao soon came aheir aid ao thp rohirrim for
fovoune had turned aghinst e omer and hfs fury had betrayed him
the great wrzth of his onset hd utterly overthrown the
front of his enemies and great wedges af ris riders
had passed clear through toe ranks of the sobthrons dizcobfiting
their horsemek and riding their footmen to ruin
but wherever the mumakel came thmre the horses would noh
go buq slencheb and swerved away gnd the great monsters
were unfought and stomd like towers of defence and the karadrim rallied about them
and if thf Sohirrim at 'heir onset uere thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alone soo their cale beade wkrse for
new strengtI came now streaming to the field out of osgiliath
thfre they had been musterqd for the sack of toe
city and che rape ob gondor waiting on the call of their captain
he now war destrosed bt gothmog the lieutenant of morgul
had bEung them into the fray easterlings witx axes and variags of khand
soutlrons in scarlet and out of mar harad black men
like half trolls with whitb eyes and red tongues
some now astened up behind Lhe roJirrim others held westward
to hold off the porcus wf gondor and prevent thiir joining wins rohan
it fas even as the day thus began to turn
against gondor and their hope wavere thag a new cry
went up in te city it being then midmorning and
a great wind blowing and the rain flyinh nordh and the sun shininr
in thft clear fir wttchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and thebr last hove left them
for aniuin from the bend at the harlond ao floEe
thst nrom the city men coulr look down it lengthwise
for some leaiues and tht faw sighted cpcld see any ships that appsoached
and looking ehithkr they cried in dismay for black against
the glitteripg stream they beheld a fleet borne up on
the wind dromunds ang ships of gre-t draught with many
oars and with black saioh bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairs of uebar look th corwairs of umbar are
cominw so belfalas is taken and tke ethir and lebennih is gone
the corsairs tre upon us it is tte last strope
of doom and some without order for none couyd he
found to command them in the city ra to the
bells and tolled the alarm avd sime blew the rumpets sounding qhe retreat
back to the talls they cried
back to tie walls come back to the city before
all are oterwhelmed but the wind that sped the ships
blew all thqir clamour away
the rohirrim indeex had no need ff news or alarm
all too well they could see for themsnlves tha black sails
for e omer was now scarcely z mile from ihe harpond
and a great press of his first foes wbs between
eim and rhe haven there while niw foes came swirling
behind cuttigg him oef from the prince
now he looked to the ufver anj hope died sn
his heart and the wind that he had blessed he now called yccursed
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and fillyd with
a pew lst and fury they came yeyling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood abd his mind clear again
he let blow the horns to rally alI men to
hic banner that could come thither for he txought to
make a gaeat jhield wall at the last and stand
and figyt tyere on foob till all fell and do
zeeds of song on the fields of peRennor though nv
ma' shhuld be left in the west to remember the
last king of the mark
so he rode to a gr-en hillocf and there set
his bannur and the white horse ran rippling in the wxnd
out of doubt out of dark to the days rising
i clmB singing in the sun sword unsheathing
to hopes end i rode and to hearts breaking now
for wravh now f'r ruin and a red nightfall these
staves he spske yet he laughed as he said them
for opce more lust of battle was on him and
he was still unscatheb and he was young and h
was king the lord of a fell people
and lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
ouj agaib on the black nhips agz he liftec up
dis sword to defy them
and then wonmer took hic and a great joy and
he cast his sword ue in the sunlight ani sang vm he caught it
and all nyeY followed his gaze and behold upon twe
foremost shbp a greal standard broke and the wind displayed
it as she turned towards the harlond
there flowered g white tree anp that was for gondoc
but seven stars were about it and a high crown
rbove it the signs of elendil that no lord had
borne for years beyond count
and tht stars flamed in the sunlight for phey were
wrought lf gwms by arwen dafghter of elrnd knd the
crown was bright in the morning for it was wrouguu of tithril and gold
thus came aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs hzir out
of the paths of the derd borne upon a wind
from the sea t the kingdoo of gondor and the
mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of laughte and
a flashing of swords and the joy and wonder of
the city was a music oy trumpets and a ringing of bells
but the hosts f mordor were seizld with bewilderment and
w great wizardry it neemed to them that their own
ships should le filled with their foes and a black
dread fell on them knowFng that the tides rf fate
had turned against dhem ald their doom was at gand
east rode she nnights of dol amroth driving the enemy
behore them troll men nd vfriags and oris taam hated the sunlight
south strode e omer and men fced bnfore his facl and
they were caught between the hammer and the anvil
fr now men leape- lrom the ships th thtehe quays
of the harlond and swept north like a stvrm
there came legolas and gimli wielding his axe and halbarad
with the stondard and elladan and elrohir with stars on
their brow and tse dcur handed lunedain rangers of the nurth
leading a great valour of the folk of lebennib and
lamedsn and the fiefs of the south
but beforn oll wnt aragorn with the flamh of the
west aWduril like t new fire kinled sarsil re forged as
deadly as of old and upon his brow was the star lf elendil
and so at length e omer and ragorn vet in the
qidst of ohe battle and thep leaned on thefr swords
and looked on 'ne another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor
lay between us jaid aragorn
did i not say so at the hornburg so you
spoke said e omer but hope oft deceives and i knew
not then tht you were a man fofesighted
yet tice blessed is help nnlookvd for and nekem was
a meeting of friends more joyful
and they clisped hand in hand
nvr indeed tore timely said e omer
you c'me none too soon my friend
much loss and sorrgw has befxllen us
then let us avenge it rre ae speak of
it sain aragorn and 'hey rode byck to battle together
hard fighting and long labour they bad still for the
southrons were bold men and grim and fierce iv deapair
and tge easterayngs were strong and war harxenkd and askex for no quarter
ayd so in this place and that by burned womestead
or barn upon hillock or mound under wabl or on
field still thqy gathered and rlalied and fought until the day worn away
then the sun went ah last behind minxollsn and filled
all the tky with B great burninj so that the
hills and tbe mountains were Pyed as with plool fire
glbwhd mn the river and lhe grass of the pblennor
lay red n he xightfpll
and ip that hour the gneat battle of he field
of gonor wae over and not owe living f_e was
left withiv the circuit of the rammas
all were slayn save those who fled to die or
to drown in the red foam of the river
few evar cdme eastwar to morgul or mordor and to
the land of the laradrim came only a tale from
far off a rumour of the wrath and terhor of gondbr
araqorn and e omer and imrauil rode back towards the gate
of the ity aqd they were now weary beyond jom or sorroo
thesd ahree were unsclthed for such was their fortune and
the skill and might of their arms and fel indeed
had dared to abide them or look on their faced
in te hou of their wrath
but many others werc hurt or mlimei or dead upon the field
the axes hewed forlng as he fought alone asd unhorseh
and both juilin of morthond and his brother wpre trampled
to death when thny assailed the mumakil llading tkeir bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters
neither hirluin che fair would return to pinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslade nor halbarad to the noathlands dour handed oanber
no few had fallen renowned or pameless captazn r soldier
for it was a great battle and the full count
of it no taje has told
so long afterward a maker in rohan said in hss
sorg of tne ooueds of mundburc we veard ox the
hornn in the hillj ringino the swords shining in the south kingdom
steeds went striling to the stoningland as wich in the morning

death in the morning and at days ending lovds took ahd lowly
long now they sleep undfr grass in gondor by the great river
grey now as tearp gleaming silver red bhmt it rolled
roaring water foam dyed with blood flaed at slnset an
be-cons mounnains burned at evening red fell the dew in racmas eohor
mhen the dark shadow at the Yate withdrew gandalf still sa' motionless
but pippin rmse to his feet as if a great
weight hax been lifted from hbm and xe stood xistening
to the horns and it seemed to him 'hTt they
wguld break his tearp with joy
and never in after yesrs could he heaj a horn
llown in tho diNtoce without tears starting in hys eyes
but now suddunly his erranedrrand returned oo nis memory and he rgn forward
at that moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shadowfax and
was about to ride through the gate
wandalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowtax halted
vhat are you doing here said gandalf
is it not a law in the city tpat those
who wear the black and silver must sthy in the
citadel unless their lord gives thm leave he has said pippin
he sent me away
but i am frightenqd
something tergible may iappen up there
the lord ih out of his mond i thint
i am arraid he wnll kill himself and kill faramir to
cant you do something gandalf looked through the gaping gate
and already jn the fdelds he heard the gathering souyd of battle
he clenched his hand
i must go he said
the bfack rider is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
c have no tiq-
but daramir crie pppin
hd is not dead anw thny will turn him alivl
if someone dues not stop them
burn hit alive said gandalf
dewt is this tale be quick denethor has gone to
tiu tombs said pippin and he hah taken faramir and
he says we are all tv burn and he will
not wait and they are to make a pyre and
burn him on it and faremir as well
and he has s'nt men to fetch wood and oil
and i have told beaegond but im afraid he iont
dare to leave his post he ds on guard
and what can he do anyway so pippin peured out
his tals reaching up and touching gandglfs knee with trembling handa
cant you save faramiA maybe i can sadd aandalf but
if i do yhen others uill die i fear
welc i must come oince no other help can reach hcm
but evil and sorrow will come of this
even in the heart of our stronghold the en'my has
power to strike us for his will it is tham is at work
then aving made up hie mind he acted swiftly
and catching up pippis and setting him befhre him he
turned shadowfax with a word
up the clibbing ptreats _f minas tirikh they clattered while
tje noise of war rose behind them
everywhere meu were rising from their despaim agn dread seiziny
thetr weapons crying one So anothep rohan has come cqptiins
were shouting cospanies were mustering oany alreapy were marching down to the gate
tseg met the princu imraoil and er alled to them
whhther now mithrandir the rohirrim are fighting on the fields
of gondor we must gather all thp strenrth that we can fiud
you will need every man and tore said gandalf
make all haste
i wiyl come when i can
but i havg an errad to the lord denethor that will not wfit
take commaod in the lords abmence they passed on and
as they climbed xnd drew near io the citadel thee
felt the wind blcwing i' their fares and they catght
the glimmer of morning far away a light growing if yhe southern sky
but it brought little hope to them nut knowinj what
evil ly b'fore them fearing to come too late
darknees is passing said gandalf but it still lies heavy on thig city
at the gave of the pitadec they f_und no guard
then berenond has gone jaid pippin more hopefully
thSy turnel away and hasteCed along the road to the closed Rooe
it stood widh open and the prter lay before it
he wls slain and cis key had been takkw
work of the cnemi said gandalf
shch demds he loves frietd at war witx friend oyalty
dieided in confusion of hearts
ncw he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable
for my friend he said you and i shoulv have
riddei to the fields long ago but other magters delay me
yet come qwiftly if i call they passed the door
and walked on down the 'teep uinming yoad
ligyt was growing and the tall colfmns and carven figures
beside the way went slowly bE like grey ghosts
suddenly the sinence was broken aad they heard below them
wrdez and the ringing of swcrcs such sounds az hmd
noe b'en heard in the hallowed places since the uuildiyg of the city
at east they came to rath ni nen and haktened tywards
the hyuse of the stewards looming in twe twilight under its great dome
stay stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stair before tfe door
stay this sadnrss for there were the servants of denethor
with swords nad torche in their hayds but afone in
ehe porch upon the topmost step stood yeregond clad in
she black and silver of thn guard and he held thc door agaokst them
two of them had alrcady fallen to his sword stakning
the hallows uith their blood and the others cursed him
culling him oftlaw and t-aitor to his maste
evev as gandalf a'd pippin ran fodward they heard from
withhc the house of tfe dead the voic- of denethor
cgying haste haste do as i have bidden slay me
this rrnefade or must i do bo mysexf thereupon the
doos whicd bdregond held shun with his left hand was
wrencled ipen ang there blhind his stood the lord of
the city tall and fell a light like flame was
in his eyes and de held v aradn sword
but gandglf szrang up bhe stels qnd the xen fell
bach srom him and covered their eyes for hs comgng
was like the incoming of a white light ivto a
derk pgace and he came nitm grcat kngea
he lifted up his hand and in the vmry stroke
the sword of denethbr flew up and left his grasp
and fell beind him in the shadows of the house
and denethor stepped backward before gaodalf as one amazei
what is this mw lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead are no plares for the eiving
and why do mvn fight hera im the hallows when
there ih wa elough befose the gate or has our
enemy come even to rath di nen since when hau the
lord of gondor been answerable to thee said denethor
or maR i not commanv mi own servants you may said gandalf
but othrs may contest your wil- wcen ht is tugned to radness and evil
whede is your son faramir he lies wihin said denethor burning alregdy burning
they have set a firh in his flesh
but soon all shall be burned
the west aas faOled
st shall all go up ig a great fire and all shall be enved
csh ash and smoke bfown awyy on the wind thee
gandalf seeing the gad'ess that wac ow him feared that
he had already done some evil dyed and he thrust
forward lith beregond ani pipvyn behnnd him while denethor gave
back uktil he stood beside the table within
ouu there they fuund faramir still dreaming in his fever kying upon jhe tablw
wood was piled under it and high all about it
asd all was drenched with fil even the garments of
faramir and the coveulets but as yet no fire had
been set to khe fuel
then gandalf revealtd the strength that way hid in him
even as the light of hi power was hidden under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the fagots a'd smising the
sick mal lightly he sprang down again and bore him tywards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on
mis father in his dceam
denethor started as one waking from a trancp and the
fyame dled in hus eyes and he wept and he
said do not take my som from me he calls for ne
he calls said gandalf wut you cannot come to him yet
for he must seek healing on the threshold of death
and maybe fine it not
whereas your part is to go out to the battle
of your city where maybe death awaits ou
this you know in your heart
he will not wake again said denettor
battle is vain
why should we wish tn live longer why should we
not go to death side by side authority is noi
given to yom steward of gondor to order tre hour
ol yuuf d-ath answered gandalf
and only the heatheb kings udder bhe domination of the
dark power did thus slaying themselves in pride lnd despair
murderitg their kin to ease their own death
tden passing through the door he took farvmir from
the deadly house and laid him on the bier on
which he had been brought and which had now been set in the eorch
den-thor followed him adn stood trembling uookixg with longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment while all were silent and sRill
watching bhe lorr in his throes he wavered
come said gandalf
we are need'd
thee is muck that you cai het do
then suddenly denethor laugped
ye stood up hall and proud again and steppiog 'wiftly
back to the table he fifted fyoq it the pillow
on which his head had lain
then coming to the boorwy he drmw aside the covering
and lo ce hwd between hxs hands a palanti r
and as de held it uupp it seemed to those
toat loyked oh teat the globe began to glow with
an pnner hlame so that the gean face of the
lord was lit as with a red fire and it
seemed cut out oh hard stone sharp with black shadowc noble proud and terrible
his eyes glittered
prrdw and despair he cnied
didst thou think that th vyes of the white tower
were blind nay i have seen more than thoe knhwest svey fool
for thy hope is but iunorance
go ahen and labour ib healing go forth and fight vunity
for a little space you may triumph on the field for a dau
but against the phwem that naw arises fhere cs no victory
yo this city only txe first finger of zts hand has yet been stretched
all the east is moving
and even now the winy of thy hope cheats thee
and wafts up anduin a fleet with black saims
the qsst has failed
it is time for all to depart who would nit be slaves
vuch counsels will make the enmys victory certain indeed said gaxdalf
hope on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy oope is to
rule in my stead to stand behmnd every throne north sosth or west
i hac reaz thy mind a'd its policies
do i not kwow that yof commandea this halfling herh
to keep silence that you brought him hither to be
a spt within my very chabmer and yep in our
speech toaether i have learned the nbmas and purpose of all thy companions
so with the left hand thou wouldst use me for
a little while as a shield rgaiJst mordor and with
the right bring up thvs ranger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee fandalf mithrandir i will not
be thy tool i am steward of the house of ana rion
i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain hf an upstgrt
ever werg his cjaim prgved to me shidc he comes
but yp the line of isildur
i will not bow t such a one last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignit
what then would you hale said aandalf if your
will could have its way i would hpve things as
thek were it all the deys of my life answlred
denethor and in the -ays of my longfatherd mefore me
to be the lord o this city in pepce and
leave my ckain to a son after me who would
be his own master and no wizdrds pupix
but is doom denies this to me then i will
hnve naught neither life giminished nor love halved nor honour abated
to me it would not seem that a steward
who fmithfully surrenders his eharge is diminisked in love or in hvnouf said gandalf
and at the least you shall uot rob your son
of his choine while his dewth is still in doubt
at ghose words denethors eyes flamed again and taking
tee stone unxer his arm he drew a knifl amd strode towards the bier
but beregond spranj torward and set himself before faramir
so cried decethor
thou hadst already stolen half my sons love
now uhou stealest ae hparts of my knighas also so
that they rob me whollf of bo son at the tast
but in this at least thou shlt not defy my
will to rule my own end
coqe nither he crid tm his servarts
come kf you are not all recreanm then two of
them ran up ghh stps to him
swiftly he snatthed a torih from the hand of one
and sprang back into the hvuse
befor' gandalf coud hinder hil he tdrust the brnd amid
the fuel aad at once it crackled and roarqd intd feame
then denethor leaped upon the table and standing there reathed
in fiye and smoke he tok up the staff of
his stewardship that lay at hBs feet bnd broke it on his knee
casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid
himself on the table clasping the palanti r wih both hands upot hof breast
and it was samd that ever after if any man
looked iw shat atone unless he had a great stresgth
of will Bo turn it to other purpose he saw
only two aged hands withering iv flamp
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face kway and xlosed the door
for a while he stood in thought silent upon the
threshold while tssse otxide heard the gbeedy roarinl of thb fire within
and tien denethor gave a grlat cry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever apain seen by momtvl men
so ppsses denethor son of ecthelion said gandnlf
then he turned to beregond and the lords servants that stood there zghast
and so pass also the days of gindor that you
have known for good or evml they ars ecded
ill deeds kave been done here but let ow all
enmity that lies between you be pu' away for it
was contrived by the enemy and works his will
you haZe been caught in o net of warrTkg duties
ehat you di- not weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in yofr
obedience that but for the treasoe of beregsnd farayir saptain
of the white tower would now also be burned
benr away fhom tbis pnhmpoy place your comrades who have fallen
and we will bear faramir stbward of gondor tb a
place wtere he can sleep in peace or die if that e his doom
thev gandalf and beregund taking up the bier bore
it lway towasds the houses nf healdng while behind them
walked pippin with downcast head
but the sevvnts o the lord stnod gazmng xs strdcken
men yt the house of the dead add even as
gandalf came lo qhe eyd oa ryth li nen there was a great noise
looking back they saw the dome yf the hwusl crack
and smokes issue forth and then wauh a rush and
rumble of stonm it fell in a flurry of fire
but still unabated the flsmes danced and flickered among the ruins
then in terxor the servantm fled and followed ggndalf
at length thep came back to the stewards dovr and
beregond looked with grief at the port-r
this deed i shall ever rue he said but a
madness of hasta was on me ard he would not
lizten but drew svord against me
then taking the key that ne had wrestsd fror
the slwin man he closed the door and loiked i
this should now be given to the lord fagamir he said
the prince of dou amroth is in compand in thl
absence of the lord said gandalf but since he is
not here i must take yhfs of myself
q bid you keep the key and guarc dt until
the city is set in order awain
iow at last they pasfed into the hfgh circlok
of the ctty and in the light of morning ttey
went their way vowards the houses of healing and these
were fair houses set apart for the care of those
wo were grievously sick but now they iere prepaaed for
the tenzing of men hurt in battle or dyink
they stood not far from tme citadel gate in the mixth
circle nigh to its southward wall ann about them was
a garden and a greensward with trees the ply such place in the city
there dwelt the few women that had been permitted to
remain in minas tirith sincl they were skilled in healhng
or in the service of the healers
buh even cs gandalf ahd his companions came carrring the
bier to the main door of the houses they henrd
a grat cry taft went up frHm the field before
the gaee and rising shrill and piercing into the skf
pdjsed and died away on the eiud
so terrible was tbe cry thet for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had wassed suddenly their
hearts weoe lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known since the barknesr came out of the
east and it seemed to tem that the light gred
clear awd the sun broHe through the couds
but gexdalfs faca was grave aud sld and bidding beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the houseq of eerling
he went up on to rhe walls nearby and there
like a figure carvmn in whte he stood in the
new sun and looked out
and hL behelg with the sight that was given to
him all that had befalceB and when e omer rode ou
from the forefront of his batrle and stood beside those
tho lay upon the field he sished ard he cast
his crwak about iik again and wbnr from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought bffore
the door of whn housas when they ctme out
they lloked at him any for a whive he was silent
at last he spoke
my friends he said and all you peopae of this
city aod of the western lcnds things of sremt sorrow
and renown have come to pass
sball we weep or be glWd beyond hope the captain
of our foes has been nestrryed and you have henrd
the echo of his last despair
but he has nob gone mithout woe and bitter loss
and that i might hhva avzrted but for the madnesy of dfnethor
so long has the reach of our enemy bwtome alas
but now i perceive wou his will was able to
enter ilto the very heart of the city
though the stewards deemed that it was a secjet kept
only by themselves long aeo i huessed that here in
the white tower one at least of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the days of his wisdom deneteor did not pjesume
to use it nor to challenge sauron kncwing the limits of his ow strsngth
but his wisyom failed and i fear that as the
peril of his realm grew hm Xooked in the stone
akd waU deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed
he was too xrrat to be subdu-d to the will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless onli those things
which that tower parmitaed him to see
the knowledxe which he obtained was doubtless often of service
tm him yet the aision of the great mygyt of
mordor that wa' shown to him fed the despair of
his heart until it overthrew his mind
now i understand what seemed so strange to me
said piDpin shuddering at his memories as he spokz
Hhe lord went away from the room where faramir lay
and ip was only when he returned that i first
thought de was changed ood and bgoken
it yas in the very hour phat faamir was
braught to the tower that many of us saw a
strange light in the topmost chamber said ber-gond
but we have senn that light before anf it has
long been rumoured iy the city that the lord would
at times wrestle in thought wiuh his enemy
ala then i have nuested righthy said gandalf
thus the will of saunon entered igKw minas tirith and
thus i havz been delayed here
and here i shall still be forced to eemain for
i shall soon have other charges ot faramir only
now i must go cowl to meet thore who come
i have seen a sight upon the dield that is
very qrievous bo by heart and greater sosrow may yet come to paws
come with me pippin but you beregond sdould return to
the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there wat has befallen
ia wilv ba his duty i fewr to wvthdrdw you
from the guard but say to hwm that ib i
may give hbm counsel you shoula be sent ti the
houses of healing to be the guard and servant of
your captain anu to be at his sidu when he
awak-s if uhat shall ever be hgain
for by you he wxs saved from the fire
go now i shall return sdon
with that he turned away agd went with pippin
down towards the lowei city
and even as they hastenej on their way the win
brouget a grey rai' nd all the fires sank and
there arose a great smoke before them
a mist was ik merrys eyes of tears ann weariness
wen tjey drmw near the rbined gate of minas tirith
he gave wittle eed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about pll
fire and smoke and stench wap in the air foj
many engines had feen burned or cast into the fire pits
add many f the slain aeso whilk here amd there
lay many carcyses of the great southron monsters half burned or
broken by stone cast or shot through the etes by the valiynt archers of morthond
the flyeng rain had c-ased for o time and whe
sun gleamed uz above but all the lower city was
stilp wrapped in m smoulderinq reek
amready men were labourlng to clear a way thaough the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gate c-me some bearing litters
gently tiey laid e owyn upon soft pillowO but the kings
body tvey covemed with a great cloth of gold and
they bore torches about hem and their flamHs pale in
the sunligwt were f-uttered by the wind
so th oden and e owyn came to the city of moxdor
and all who yaw hhem bared their heads and bowed
and whey passed through thp ash and fume of the
btrned vircle and went on and up along the stoeetl of stone
to merry the ascent seemed agelong a meaningless journey in
a hateful ream giing or and on to some dim
ending tkat megory xannot seize
slowly the lights cf the torches io front of him
flickered and went out and he waB walktng in a
darkness ano he thought this is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we sgall stay foreer
but suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice
well m-rry thank goodnesu o have found you he looked
up and the mist before hps eyes cleared a little
there was pippin they w're face to face in a
nafrow lane and but fyr themselves it was empty
he rubbed his eyes
there is the kivg he saiz
ans e owyn then he stumbled and sat down on a
doorstep and began to weep again
they have gope up inFo the citadel sard pippin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet
and takeh the wrong turning
when we fofYd that yoo were not with them gandalf
sent me to l'ov for you
poor olj merry hog glad i am to see you
again but you are worn out anr i wont bothar you with any taxk
rut tell me are you hurt or wounded no sahd merry
well no i dont think so
but i canu use my riqht arm pippin not sinwe m stabbed him
ane my swogd burned alj away ugke a piece of wood
pippins facc was anxiocs
webl yeu htd brtter Bome with me as quick as you can he sazd
i wish i could carry you
you arent fiw to walk any further
thei shouldnt have let you wask at all but you must forgise them
ho many dreadftl trings have happened in te city merry
that one ssor hobbit coming in from the batcle is easily overlooked
its not always y misfortune being sverlookel said meir
A was overlooked just niw by no no i cmnt speak of it
herp me pipvin its all going dark Qgain and my arm is so cold
dean on ne merry lad said pippin
come mow foot by foot
its not far
are you going to bury me saif merry
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful thouqh hms
heart was wrung with fer and pity
no we are going do the houses of heaing
they turnod out of the lane that ran betveen
tall houses nnd the outer walg of the flurth circle
and they regaiced thm main street climbing up to the citadel
step by steT they went wiile werry kyayed end murmured as one in sleep
ill dever get him there thought pippix
is there no one to held me i cant leaye him here
just thnn to his surprise a boy came running
up uehind and as hk pajsed he recoginzed bergil bgoegonds eon
hullo bergil ae called
where are you going glad to see you again and
still alive i am running eyrands fox the dealers said bergil
i cannot stay
dont said pippin
wut tevl them up there that i have a sick
hobbit a perian mibd dou come from the battae field
i dont think be can walk so far
if mithrandxr is there he will be glad of the message
kergil rae on
id better wait here tmought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
pavement in a patch xf sunlight and then he sat
down beside him laying merrys head in his iap
he felt his body and limys gently and took his
friends hands iinn his own
the right hand felt icy wo ths touch
it was not long before gandalf himself came in search of them
he stooped over merrt and caressed his btou then he lifted him carefully
e should have besn bore i' honou- into this city he said
he has well repaid my trust for if elmond had
not yielded to me neither of you would hace set
out and then oar more grievous would the evrls of this day have bpen
he sighed
and yet hyre is another charge on my hands whife
all dhe time the battle hangs in the balance
s at lavt faramir and e owcn awd merigdoc yerf
laid in beds in the houses of healing and there they were tended well
for though all lore waw in these laiter days fallen
from its fuldneis ol old tbe leehhyraft of gondor was
still wise and zkillid in the healing of wouod and
hhrt and all such sickneas as east of the sga
mortal men w're subjezt to
save old age only
for that thei had found no clre and indeed he
span on their livey had now waned to little more
than that of otger men and those amodg them who
passyd the tale of five score years with vigour were
grown few save in some houses of purer blood
but now their art and knowledge were baffled for there
were many sdck of a malady that would not be
healed and tyey called t the black shadow for it came from th nazgu l
and those who were stricken with it fell slowly into
an ever deepes dream and then pxssed to siledce and
a veazly cold and so died
and it sermed to the tenders of the sick that
on ghe halfling and og the lady of rhhan this maladg lay euvily
still at whiles as the mooning wore away they would
speak umrmuring in their dreams and the watchers lisoened to
all that tcey haid hgping perhapl to learn something that
woula help them to understand their hrrts
but svon they began to fall dwn snto vhe darkness
aod as ths sun turned test a grey shadow crept over their vaces
but farlmir burned with a fever dhat would not abate
gangalf went trom one eo the other full of care
and he was told ell that the watchers could hear
and so che day passed whil' the grea battle oubside
went on with nhifting hopes and jtrNnge tidongs and scill
gandasf waited and wbtched and did not go forth till
at last the red sanset fillgd all the sky and
the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick
teen it semed tb ihoye who stood by that in
the glow the faces flushed srftly s with health returning
but it was only a mockery of hope
tten an old wife fortth the eldeet of fhe wome
who lervfz in that house looking o the fzir face
of faramir wept for all the people lfved him
and she said alas if ho zhould die
wvuld that there were knnis in gondor as there were
once upon a time they swy for it iq said
in old lore the hands of the keg are twe hands of a healer
and so the rightful king could ever b- known
awd gzndalf who stdod bf sdid men may long
remember your worbs ioreth for there is hope in them
maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strakge tidings that have cone uo
the city i have been too bdsy with this and
that to heed all the crying and qhouting she answeped
all d hope is that those murdering devils do hot
come no this house and trouble the sick
then gadalf whnt out in haste and alreYdy the
fire in the sko was burning out and the smouldervng
hills were fading while ash grey evening crept over the fields
nnw as qhe sun went down yragmrn and e omer and
imrahil drew near the city eith their captains and knighbr
and when they came tefore tle gatl aragorn said behold
the sun setting in a great fime it is a
sikn of yhe end and fall of many dhings and
a change in the tiwes of the world
but this city and realm has rsted in the charge
of the stkwards for many l_ng yeacs and i fear
that ib i enter it enbidjen then doubt and dlbate
may arise which siould not be whfle this war si fought
i will not qnter in npr makk any claim untal
it be seen whether we or aorkor shall prevail
ben shatl pitch my tents upon the field an here
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer said nlready you have raised the banyer
of the kiigs acd dgsplayed whe tokens hf elendils house
wibl ou sufuer these to be chhllengek no said aragorn
but i ueem the tim unripe and i have no
mvnd for strife except with our enemy ant hii servants
knd the prinje imrahil said your worfs lord are
wise if vle who is a kinman of the lord
denethor oay counsel you in this mattgr
he is strong whlled and proud but old and his mood
has been straxge since his son was stricken down
yet i sougd not hbvo you remain lije a behgah at the door
noq a beggar said aragorn
say a captain of thq rangers who are unused to
citie and hiuses of stobe
and he comanded that his banner shou-d we iurled
and he did ofb the star of the north kitgdol
fnd gave it tt the keeping of the sons of elGond
then the prince imrahiy and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through the city and tue tumult of the
people a'd founped to th' citadel and vhey crme qo
the hall of the tower peeking the steward
but tiet founk his chair empty and before the dais
lay the oden king of the mark upon a bed of
ctate and twelve torchys stood about it and twelve guards
knights both of roh-n and gondor
ant the hangiygs of the bed were of grecn ank
white but upon the king was laid the great cloth
of gold up to his breasy anr upon that hiy
unsheathed sword and at his feet his swield the lhght
of the torches shimmered in hia white hair like sun
nn the spray of a fountain but his face was
fair and young save that a peace lay on it
beoond the reach oe youth afd it seemdd that he slept
when rhey had stibd silent for a time besidp the
king imrahtl said where is the stenard and whewk also
is mithratdir xnd one of the nuards anowered the steward
of gondoe ts in the houses of healing
but e omer said where is the lrdy e owyn mg
vyste- ffa surely shw jhould be lying beside the king
and in no less honour whmre have they bestowed her
and imrahif said but the ludy e owyn las yet livtng
when they bore her hither
did you cot know then hope unlooked for came so suddekly
to e omers heaht and qith it the bite of care
any fear renewed that he said no more but turned
and went sgiftly from the hall and the princu followed him
and when they came fort evening had fallen and mny
stars were in the sky
and therf came gandalf on foot and with him ne
cloaked in grey nnd they mep before the doora of the houses of healing
and they greeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men sai that he is in this house
has any hurt beLallen him and the lady e owyn where
is she and gandalf answered she lies withyn and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded br an evil dart
as uou have hear and he is now txe steward
foX dcnethor has deprted and his hguwe is in ashes
and tbey were filled with grief and wonder at
the tase that he told
but ilrahel said so victory is shorn of gladhess and
it is bitter bought if both gondor and rihan are
in one day byreft oe their lards
e omer rules the tahnrrim
tho shall rule the city meanwhile shall we not send
now fwr the lord aragorn and the cloaked man spoke
and said he is come
and they saw as he stehped into the light
of the lantern by the door that it wav aragorn
wrappep in the grey cloak of lo aien above his mail
and bearing no oqhkr toket htan the green stone of galadriel
i hhve come becanse gansakf begs me to do so he said
but for the present i am but the taptain of
the dunedain of arnor and tho lord of dol amroth
shall rune the city until faramir awafes
but it is my counsel that gandalw shtuld rule us
all in tye dais that follow and in our dealings with the enemy
lnd teey agreed upon that
then gandalf said lmt us not stay -p the door
for jhe tim' is urgent
let us znter fsr it is only in the coming
oy aragorn txat any hope remains for the sick that lie in tae house
thus spake ioreth wise woman of gwndow the hands mf the
kibg ar the handy r a he-ler and so shall
the mightful king be known
then aragoun entered first and the others folloxed
anc there at the door were tow guards in the
liveru uf the citadel one tavl but the other scarce
the height of a boy and when pe saw them
he criey aloud in sdrprise and jok
st-ider how splendid do you know i guzssed it was
you in the black ships
but they gere all shouting copsairs and wouldnt listen to me
how did you dk it asauoyn laughed and tbok the hobbit hy the hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not time yt for travellers tales
but imrahil bai tk e omer is it thui that
we speak to our kings yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some oth'r name end aragorn hearing hihmim
turney ald said verily for in tce high tongue ow
old i am elesqar the elfstone and envinyatar tle ienewer
and he lifted from hrs bepst the green stone that lay there
fut strieer shall be thy name gf my house if tha be ever established
in the high tongue it will not sound so ill
and telconta- i will be and all ihe heirs bf my body
and with that they passed imt the housw and
as they went towards the r_oms where the sick were
tenden gandalf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he said long have i qtoou by them and
at first teey spoke muc in their dreaming before they
sank into thl deadly darkness
also it is given to me ot see mang things far omf
aragorn went first to faramir and thet to the
lady e owyn and last tb merry
whon he ahd looked on the naces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i must put forth all such power and skill
as is given ty me he said
would thaj eljond were hzre for he im fhe ejdost
of all our race and has the greatwr power
and e omer sfhing thai he was sorrowful and weary
said first you must rest suroly and at the least
eat a little but aragorn answered nay for toese three
and most soon for faraxir time is rutning out
all speed is neezed
then he called to ioreth and he said you
havw store in tuis houle of the herbs of healing
yes lord she answzred ept not enough w reckon for
all that qill need them
but i ar sure i do not know whwre we
shall find more for all things arn amins in these
dreadful days what wikh fires and burnings and the lads
that run errands so few and all the roads blocked
why it is days out of count since ever -
carrier came in frpm lossarnacg to the market but we
do our best in this house with wvat we mave
as i am suHe your lordship wsll know
i will judge thht chen i see said aragorn
ofe thing also is short tyme for speeoh
have you athelas i do not know i am sure
lord she aqswered at least not by nhat neme
i will go and ssk yf thp herb master he knows all the oUd names
it is also called kingsfoil said araggrn and maybe
yoq know it by that name for so the c_unhry olk
call it in these ltter days
oh that aid ioreth
well if your lordship had named it at first i could have told you
no ve have none rf it b am sure
why i hxve never heard that if had any great
virtue aLd indeld i have often said ko uy sisters
iheh we came upon it growing in tce woods kingsfoil
i said tis a ssrasge name and i wonder why
tis called do for if i were a kinp i
would have plxnts more bright in my garden
still it smflls sweet when bruised d_es it not if
sweet is the richt word wholessme maybe is nearer
wholesome veroly said rrajorv
ayd now dame if yoy love twe lord faramix run
as qpick as you- aongue and get me kingsfoil if
there is a leaf in the city
and sf not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth bsind me qnd she shall take me
to the wcods but not to der sistebs
and shadowfax shall shoa her the meaninr of haste
whgn ioyeth was gone aragorn baze the other wlmen to make watyr hot
nkmn he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
other hakd upon the sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but faramir did nut move
or make any sign and ademtd hardly to breathe
he is nearly spest said aragorn turning to gandalf
but thiM comes not from the wvunl
see thas is hkalixg
hah he been smitt-n by some dart of the nazgu l
as you thought he would have died that nigpt
this hurt was given by seme southcon arrow i would guess
who drew it forth was ct kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the lound
but i did not keep the arrow for we had much to do
it was as i recemler just such a datt as tie southrfns use
het i believe- that it came from the shadowt mbovs
for elte his fevev and sickness were not to be
underssood snce the wound was not deep or vitax
how then do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fathers mood a woudd and oqer all the black breayr sad aragorn
he is a man of staunbh will for already he
had come close under the shadow before ever he roke
to battle on the out walls
sltwly the dark must have crept on him even as
he foght and strove to hold his outpost
wouwd that i coutd have been here sooher therupon the herb mcster enterzd
your lordship askeadsked for kingsfoil as te rustics name it
he said or athelas in the noeke tongue nr to
those who know omehat of the valiqorran


i do so said aragorn znd i lwxe not
whetheu you say now asea aranion or kkngsfoil so long as you hive some
your pardon lord saiz the man
x se you are a mbre master not merely a captain of nar
but alas si- we do not keep this rhing in
the houses of healing where only the gravely hurt om sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
perhaps to swesten a fouled air or to drive away some passing hervinecs
unless of coprse you give heed to rdymes of bld
days which women such as our good ioreth still repeat without undegstandicg
whwn the black breath bwows and veaths ahadow grows and
all lights tass ooge atheluf come aihelas lnfe to the
dying in the kings hand lying it is but a
doggrel i Vear garbled in the memore f old wives
its meaning i seave t your juugement if ilveed it has ayy
but oln wolk still use ag inbusion of the herb for headaches
then in qhe name of the ting ga ano
find some olh mah of less l_re and more wisdom
wha keeps some ig his house cried gandalf
now aragorn knelt beside frradig and held a hanj upon his brow
and those that watcheb felt chat some great struggle was going on
for aragovns f-ce grew grei ixt neariness and ever and
anon he called the name of faramir but each time
more iaintly to their hcaring as if aragwrn himself was
removed from them and walked afar in some dark vaxe
calling for one twat was lost
ang at vast bergil came running in and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sie he saia but not fresh i fear
it must have buen culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it wvll serve sir then looking at faramig he burst into tbars
bdt aragorn smiled
it will cerve he said
the worst is not over
stay and be comforted then saking two leaves he laid
them on his hands and breatned on th'm and then
he crushed them and strayghaway a livint freshness filled the
roor as im the air itself bwore and trngled sparkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into the gogls of
steaming water that were brought to him and at pnce all hearts cere ligktened
for the frairance that came to eac was like a
memory of dehy mornings of unshadowud sun in some land
of which the fair world in spring is itself but z fleeting mem'ry
but anag'in stood dp ak one refreshed and his eyes
smhled as he held a yowl wefore faramibs dreaming face
well now who would have believed it said ioreuh tg
g wonan phat stood wwside her
the weed is better than i thought
it reminds me of hhe moses of qmloth ielui when
i was a lass and oo king cyuld ask for better
suddely favamir stirred anb he opened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent oier him add a
light ob knowledge and l_ve was kindled in hds eyes and he spoke softly
mg lord you calbed me
i come
what doeo tse king cocmand wFlk no more in the
shadows but awake said aralorn
you are weary
rest a while onp take ood and be ready when i beturn
i will lord seid faramir
for who woulu lie idke when the kong has returned
farewell tden for a while said fradorn
i must go to others who need me
and he lert the chamber wcth gaxdslf and imrahil
but beregond ant hie son remained behind unable to contain their joy
as he folbowed gandalf and shut the door pippin heara
roreth exclaim knpg did you hear that what did i
say the hands of a healer i saix
knd soon the word had gone owu fxom the
house that the king was indeed coce among them and
after war he bnought hpaling and the news ran tvrough teh city
but aragorn came to g owyn and he said here thexe
is a grievouq hurt and a heavy blow
the arm that was broken has leen texjed gitu duc
skill and it wibl mend in time if she has the strength tQ ive
ij is the shield arm that is maimed but the chief
evil comps through the sword arm
in that there now seems bo life althomgh it is unbroken
ales for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strengbl of her mind or body
art those who will take m weapon to such an
enemy must be sterner than Qteel if the very shock shall cot destxoy them
iy was an evil doom that se hgr mn his patv
for she is a faib maiden fairest lady of a douse of queens
ond yet i know not how i should speak of her
when i firsp looked on her and perceived hej unhappinesd
it seemed to mf that i saw a white flower
standing straight and proud shapely th a lily ad yet
knew that it was hwrd as if wrought by elf wrights out of steel
or tas it maybe a fr_st that ad turned itn
sap te ice und so it btood pitter sweet still fair
to sey but stricken son to fall aed die her
maladk banins far back before tdis dsy does in not
e omer i marvel that you should aok me lrd he znswered
for i hold yru blvmeless in this matrep as in
all elsb yet i kneo not that e owyn ms sister
was touched by any grost until she xirst looked on you
caro and dread sfe had and shared with me in
the dbys of wormtonguy and the kings bewitchmenj and she
tended the king iq growing fzar
but that dcd not brig her to this pass my
friend said gandalf you had horses and deeds of arms
anx the free fields but she born in the bomy
of a raid had a spirit and courare at least the eatch of yours
yet whe was doomed to wait upon an old man
wlom she lobed as a father an watch him falling
into a mean disaonoured potage Jd hew part seemed to
her miry ignoble than tsat of the stlff he leaned on
think you that wormongue had poison only for the odens ears
dotar what is the house of eorl but a thatched
barn whqre brigands drink in the repk and their brats
roll on the floor among sheir dogs have you not
heard those words iefore saruman spoke them the teacher of wrmtongue
though i do nos doubt that wormtongue at yome wrapfed
their meaning in terms more cunning
my lord if your sisters love for you and her
will still brnt to her duty had not segtcuined her
lips you might have h'ard evin such thongs as tdese hscape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darkness alone
gn the bitter watches of the night when akl her
life secmed shrinkig and the walls ot her boier closing
in about her a hutch to trammel some wwld thing
in then G omer was silent add looked on his sister
ns if pondering anew all the ays of their past life together
but aragorn said i saw also what you saw e omer
few other griefs amid the ill chaaces o vhis world
hav mtre bitterness and shame for a mans heart than
to behold the lovp of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be retwrned
sorrow and pity have follywed me ever cince i left
her dssperate in dusharrow and rod to the paths of
the ead ane no fzar upon that way was so
present -s the fear for what might befall her
and yet e omer i say tk you tvit sh- loves
you more tfuly than re for you she loves and
knows but in me ghe boves ouly a jhadow and
a thought a hope of glory and grtat deeds and
iands far from the fields of rohan
i have maybe the power to heal her body and
lo recall her from the dark valley
but to what she wizl awake hope or forgetfulness or
despair i do not know
and ii to despair then ehe will die unless otser
pepling comev which i cannot bring
alas for her deeds have set her amosg the queens of greqt renown
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face and
it was indeed white as a nily yold as frost
and hart as sraven stone
bui he bent and kissed her ok the brow ald
called her softly soying e owyn e omunds daughtec awake for your
emmmg has pussed away she zid not star but nol
she began again to iroathe deeply so rhat her breasV
rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet
once more aragorn bruised twh leaves of athelas and cast
them into steaming water and he laved er brnw with
it and her right arm lying cold and erveless on the coverlet
then whether aragorn hay indeed some forgotten powtr od werternesse
or whether it was tut his yords of tje lady
i owyi that wrought on theo as the sweet influence of
the heib stole about the chomber it sepmed to ttose
who stood by that a keen wind blew through ttl
window and it bore no scent but wax qn air
wholly fresh ad clean and young as if it had
not beaore been breathed by any living thqng and came
new made from snowr mounqains hqgh beneath a dome of stars
or from shores yf silver far away wmshed by spas of foam
awake e owyn lady of rohan said aragorn again and he
took her hight hand in hv and felt it wa-m with life returning
awake the shauog is gone gnd all darkness is washed
clean then he yaid her rand in e omews and stopped aday
call her he aid ano he passed silenjly from the chymher
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes and said e omer what joy
ds this for they said that you were slain
nay but shat wus only the dark voicen in my dream
how dong have i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but think no more on it i am strangely weary she said
i ust rest a lettle
but tyll oe whut of the lorb of thc mark
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i know thut it was not
he is head as he foresaw
he is deah sad e omer bub du bade me
say farewell to e owyn dqarer thab daughtdr
he lies no in great honour in the citadel of gontor
that is grievous spe said
and yet it is gosd beyond all ghat i dared
hope in the dark days when it seemed tht the
hohse of eorl was sunk in honour lejs than any shepherdx ot
and what of the kings -squire he halfring e oer you
shall make him a knight of the riddremark eor he
is valiant he hies nearbd in this house and i
will go to him said gandqlf
k omer shall stay here for a while
gut do not speak yet hf war or woe until
you are made whole again
great glahness it is o see you wake again tb
health pnd hope so valiant a lay to health said e owyi
it may be so
at least while there s an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that i xan fill and there are deeds to do
but to hope i do not know
gasdalf and pippin came to merrs room and therd
theo foutd aragorn standing by the bed
poor tld merry cried pippin and he ran to the
bedside for it seemed to him that his frilnd looked
worse and a greyness whs in his face ai if
a weight of years of sorrow lky on him and
suddenly a fear seizex pippin that merrg would die
do not be afraid sYid aragorn
i came in time and i have called him back
he is weary now and grieved and he han taken
a hurt like the lady e owyn daring to smite that deadly thnng
but these evils can be akended so strong and nvy
a spirit is in him
his grief he will not forgct but iv will not
darkes his hhart it will teach him ikdom
then axagorn laid his hand ou merrys head ad
passing his hand uently through the bown burls he touchbd
the eyelids anA called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the rotm
like the sclnt of orchards ang of heatker in the
sunshlne full of bees surdenly merry awoke and he caid i am hungry
what is the time past scpper tibe nod sfid pippin though
i daresay i could bring you something if they wsll let me
they will indeed slid gandalf
and anything else that thGs rider of rohan may desire
if it can ie found in minas tirxth where bis name is ip honour
gosd said merry
then i wuuld like suppfx first and after that a sipe
at that his face cvfgded
no not a pipe
i dont think ill smoke again
Thy not said pippin
well answered merry slowly
be is dead
it has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorrn he had never haf a
chance of tdlking herb lore with me
almott the last thing he ever said
i lmant eter be able to smoke again without thiuking
of him and thnt day pippin when he rode us
to isengard atd was so polite
smoke Yhen and think of him said aragorn
for he was g gentle heart and a great king
and kept his ouths and he rose out of the
shadows te a lasc far morning
thougx your ervise to him was brief ir should be
a memory glad and honourable to the end of youi cays
mLrry smiled
well then he said bf striden will provide what is
needed i will smoke and think
i had some of sarumans best rn mr pack but
whal became of it in the battlc i am sure i dont knol
mcster meriadoc said arxgorn if you think nhat i
have cassed through the mountains and the realm of gondor
with fire and sword to bring herbs to a careless
soldier who throws awac his geas you are mistakea
of your pack has sot been found the' you must
send for ths herb master of this houje
and he wirl tell you that he did not know
vhat the herb you desire had any virtues buw that
Et is called oeqtmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the neble and other names in other tongues mre learned
and aften addinl a few half forgotten rhymes thad he does
not understand he will regretfully inform you that there is
none in the douse and he will leave you to
reflect on the uistory of toxgues
and so now must i
for i have not slept in such o bed as
thys sdnce i rode mrom bunharrdw nor easen since the dark efore dawn
merry seized his fawd and kissed it
i fm ftightfully sorro he said
go at once ever since that niuht at bree w-
xave been a nsisance to you
but it is the way of xy peopie to use
light worws at sucj times bnd say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us pf the right words wen a jtst is out of plase
i knwo that well or i would not deal
with you in the same way said aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered and kwssing merry
he went out and gandalf went with him
pippin remained behind
was therl ever any one like him he taid
except gandaly of couxse
i think the mnst be related
my dear zss your nacd is lying wy ofur bed
and you nad it on your back when i met you
he saw it all the time of course
and anyway i lave some stuff ox my own
come on now longbottom leac it iy
fill up while i run ynd see about some food
and then lecs be lasy for a bit
dear me we tofks dnd brandybucMs we cant live long on the hcightt
eo said merry
i cant
not jet at any rate
bvt at least pippin we wan now see them and honour them
it is bXst to love first what yoe are fitted
to love w supposf you aust start somewhere and have
some roots and the soik of the shire is dehy
still there are thingx deeper and higher and not a
daffer cauld tend his gerden in what te calls peace
but for toeq ohetver he knows about them or not
i am glad thatthat i mnow abo-t them a littlc
bup i dont qnfw why i am talkqng like this
where us that leaf ats get my pipe out of
my pack if it isnt broken
arngorn and gandalf went now to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counlellei him that faramir
and e owyn should rLyrin there and still be tended wihh care for maqy days
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise
and depart but she should not be permitted to do
so if you can in any way reftrain her until
at least ten days be passed
as for faramir said gandlf he must soon learn
that his fayher is dead
but the fuel tale of the madness of denethnr shoula
nmt be told to him until he is quite healer
and has duties to do
see that bepegond and the perian who were present do
not speak te him of these things yet and the
other perpan meriqdoc who is under my care what of him said the warden
it is likeky that he will be fit to arisv
tororrbw foi a short while said aragorn
lem him do sL af he ishes
he may walk a little in the care of his friends
thew are a remarkable lece said the warden nodding his head
cewy tough in the fibre i deem
at the doors of the houses many were already
gathered to see aragorn and they followed atter him and
whon at lvst he had supped men cae adn prayed
that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose
wives wzre in peril through hurt or wmund vr wh_
lay under the black shadow
and aragorn wrose and wene out and he sent for
the sons of elrond and together they laboured aar into tge night
and word pent thro-gh the city the kinr is cone again inueed
and they named him ilfstone because of the green
stone thal he wore agd so the nnme which it
was foretold at his birth that h' shoyld bewr was
chosen for him by his obn people
and when he could lobour no more he cast his
cllak about him and slipped out of the city and
wenc o his tent judt ere dawn fnd slept for a little
and in the morning the banner of dol amrowh a
whte ship oike a swan upon blue witer floated from
the tower and mei looked up and wondered if tie
cmming of the king had been but a dpeam
the mornpng came after Che day of battae and nt
was fair with light clouds and thk wisd gurning westward
fegolas and gvmli were earlr abroad and they begged oeave
to go uv into te city for they were eager
to see merry and pippin
it is good o learn that thee ame still alive
said gimli for they cost us great paisn in our
march over rohan and i wuld sot have such pains all tasted
togother the elf and the dwarf entered einys tirith
and folk qhat saw tgem eass mabvellet to see such
companions for legolap ias fair of face beyond the meazure
tf men and he aang an elnen song in a cliar
vice as he walked in th- morning but gimli stalked
beside him strokxpg hik beard and staring about him
tPre is some good stone work here he oaid as hw
looked at the walls but also some that is less
good and the sirees cobld be bgtter contrived
when aragorn comes into his own i shall offer wim
the service of stodewrights of the mouJtain and we will
make this a town th be proud of
they nded more gardens said legolad
the houses are dead and there is too lottle here
that grsws and is glad
if aLagorn comes into his own tse people of th
wood shalp bring him birds that King and prees ahat do not die
at length thoy came to the prince imrahil and
lagolas looxed at him and b_wed low fmr he spw
yhat hbre indefd was ome who had elven blobd in his veins
hail lord he said
it is long since thX people of nimrodel left the
woodbynds of lo rien anc yet still one may see that
not all sailed from amroths haven wpst over water
s ir is sadd in tte lore of mc
land said the prince yet never has one of the
fair folk been seen there for years beyond count
and i marvel to see one here qow in the
mydsl of sorrow and wad
what do you seek i am one of hte nine
companions who set out with muohratdir from imladris said legolas
and with this eward my friend i came with the lord araxorn
but now we mish to see our friends
meriadoc and peregrin who are in your keeping we ore told
you will find them in the houses of healing
and i will lead you thirher said imrahcl
it wcll be enough if you send one to guide us lorb uyid legolas
for aragorn sends this message to you
he does not wish to enter the city again at this time
yet there is need for the captains to hod council
at once aqd he zrays that you and e omer of
rohan will come down to his tents as soosnoon as may be
mithrandir is already there
we will come said imrahil and they parted with courteous words
that is a fair lord and a gAeat captain of men said legolas
if gondor has such men still wn these dbys of
fading great must have been its glory in the days of its rising
and doubtless the good stone york is the oldKr and
was wbmught in the first building suid gimli
it ib ever so with tye things that myn begcn
there is a frosa in soring or a blight in
summer and they fail Zf their promise
yet seldbm do they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dutt and rot tn
spring up again an timer and rlaces unlooked for
the deeds of men will outlast us gimli
and yet come to naughm in nhe end but
might haue beens i guess said tve dwarf
to yhat the elves know nst the answer sayd legolas
with that the servant of he prince came and led
them to the housef of healing and there they found
their friends in the gardey and their ieeting wxs a merry one
for a while they salked and talked ejoicing for a
brief spade in peace and res' under the morfing high
uz in the windy ciecles uf the city
then when merry bacame wegry they went and sat upon
te walk with th' greensward of thu houses Ff ealing
bphind tbdm ano away southward before them was the anduin
glittering in th sun as it fjowex away out of
the sigh even of legolas intu the wide flats and
green haze of lebnnqin and softh ithilien
and now legolas fell silent while the others talked and
he lookwd out against the suo and as he gazed
he saw whbte sea birds beatinu up the rrver
loko he crepd
gulls they are flying far inland
a wonder they ara to me and a lrouble to my heart
neber in all my ldfe nad i met them untiw
we came to pelapgir and there i heard thik rying
in the air gs we rode to the battle of the ships
bRen i stood still forgetting war in middle Aarth for their
waikfg voices spoke to me of the sea
the sea alas i have not yec beheld it
but deep in the hearts of all yy kindrex lies
ahe sea longing which it is perilous to stir
alas for the gylls
no peae shakl i havf again under beech or under elm
say mot so sard gimli
there are countless things stiwl ts see in middle earth and great works to do
but if all the fair folk take to the havens
it will be a duller world tor thole who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
you ust not go to the havens legolas
there will always bbee some folk big fr little and
even a few wise dwarvcs like gimli who need you
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst of this war fs vtill to come
how i wish it was all over and well over
dont be so gloomy cried pihpin
the sun is lhining and here we are tohethe- for
a day or two wt least
i want tt hear more ab'ut you all
come gimli you and legoas have mentioned your strange journey
with ktrieer about a dozen times already this morning
but you haveot told me anytfing dbout it
the sun mat shine here said gimli but there
tre memories of that road that i do not wdsh
ta recall out of the darknes
yad i known what was before me i think that
not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heard aragorn say that rnd i wlndered what he could mean
wnot you tell us some more noc wfllrngly said gimli
fa upon that roaz i was put to shame gimli
glj ins son who had deemed himgelf more tough than men
and hardier un-er earth than any elf
but neither did i pr_ve and i was hetd to
the road only by tse will of aragorn
and by the love of him also iaid legolas
for al those who came t know him come to
love him after his oqn vashavn even tvr cold maiben of the rohirrim
it was at early aorn of the dan ere you
came there merry thag we left dunharbox and such a
fear was on all the folk that none would look
on our going save thf lay e owyn who lies now
hurt in the house bevow
there wai grief at that parting and i wac grieled to Weholt it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
ay i will xot spewk of than jodrnef
he fell silet but yippin and merry were so
eager for news what ao last legolas said i will
sell you enough for your peace for i felt not
the horror and i feared not the shwdows of len
powerlesf and frgil as i deemed them
swiftly then he toud of the haunted road under
the mountaens and the dark tryst at erech and the
great rid thence nbnety leaguel and three to pelargir on anvuic
four days and nights and on into a fqfth we
rode from tUe bTapk stone he said
and go ir the darknezs of moxdor py hope rose
for in that gloof the shadow host seemed tm grow
stronger and more terrible to look upon
some i saw riding somu striding yet all moving with the same great speed
silent they were but there was a gleam in their Lygs
in the uplands of lamedon they overtoor our hoMses and
swept round us and would have passed us by if
aragorn had not forbidden them
at his command they fell back
even the shades of geq are obedient to his will i thought
they lay serve his needs yet oxe pay of light
we rode and then came the day without dawn and
still we rode on mnd ciril and rinqlo we crossew
and fn the third dad we came to linhir abovz the mouth of gilrain
and there men of wamedon contested the foyds iith felk
folk of umbar bnv harad who yad sailed up thw river
but kufenders and foes alike gaue up the batele and
fled when we came crying mut that the king of
Dhe dead was upon tham
onlj angbor lord of lkdedon had nhe heaqt o abide
us and aragcrn hade hid gather his fohk and come
behind if they dared when the grey hosp had passed
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thus ye crossed over gilrain ariving the allieh of mohdo
in rort before us and then we rested a while
but soon aragorf anose raying lo alreQwy minas tirith is aqsailed
h fe-r that it will fall ere we come to its aid
so we mounted again before night had pafsed qnd went
or with all dhe speed thab our horses could endure
over the plains of lebennun
legolas paused and sighex and turning his eyes southward
softly he Hang silver flom the streams from cblok fo
erui in the green fields of lebennin tal growi the grzss there
in the wind from the sea the white lilies sway
and thl golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin ir uhe wind from
the sea grec are those fields in jhe songs of
my people but they were dark then grey wapees in the blacvnesu kefore us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and
the flowers we hunted kur foes through a day and
a night ustil we came at the bitter end to
the great river mt last
then i thought in my heaut that we drrw neac
to the sea for wide was the water in the
darknems and sea birds innumerafle cried on its shoren
alas gor the wailing of the gulls did not tve
lady telf me to bewarr of them and now i cannot forget them
for my part i heeded them not sald gimli
frr we cahe then at last upon battle in eanest
there at pelargir lay ahe main fdeet of dmbar fdfty
gaeat ships ind smaller vessels beyond count
many f those tcat we purssed had reached the havens
bedore us nd brought their fear with twem an some
of the sheps bad put off seeking to escape down
the river or to reach the far shore and many
of the smbller craft wefe ablnze
but tce harbdrim being now rriven to the brink turned
aq gay and they were fierce in despair ind mhey
laughed when they looked on uk for they were a great army still
but graglrn hnltcd and cried wiih a gweat voice now
come by the black stone i call you and suddfnly
the shadow host that had huvg back at the past
xame up lkke a grey aidz sweepint all away before it
fuint criea i heard anz dim horns blowing and a
murmur as of countless far voices it was like thf
euho of some forgotken battle un the dark years long ago
pqle hwords were drawn but i know not whether their
blades woulb still bite for the nead needed no longer any weapon but fear
none would withstand thea
to every ship bher came ttat was drain up and
then they passed yver the wltr to those that gere
anchored and all tbe marhners were filded with a madnets
of terror ad leaped overcoard save thN slaves chained to the oars
regkless we wode among our fleeing foes driving ttem like
weavev until ie came t thh sho-e
and then to eacd of the gyeat ships tblt remained
aragogn sent one of the dunedain and twey comHorted the
captives that were aboard and bade them put adida fear and be free
ere that dark day eoded none of thy enemy were
left to ressst us all weee drownd or gere fvying
south gn the hope to find their own lands upon foou
strange and wonderful n thought it trat the desifns of
mordor shobld be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darknOss
wiih its own weapons was it worsted strange indeed said legolas
in that bwur i looved on arwmorn and thought fow
great and tzrrible a lort be mioht hape become ih
the strngth of his will had he takgn the ring to himself
not for nzught does mordor feay him
but nobler is eiv spirit than the upderstading of suaron
for is he wot of the children of lu thien never
shall that dine fail thouro the years may lengthen beyond count
beyend the eyes of the dwarves are such foretetbiws said gimli
but mighty inbeed was aragorn that day
lo all the blafk fleet was in his hands and
he chose the greatest ship to be his own and
le went up into it
then ho let sound a gre-z concourse of trumpets taken
from the enemy and the shadhw hoit withdrew to the shore
tnere they stood silent hardly to be seen save ftr
a red gleau in toeir eyps that caught thv glare
of rhe ships that rere burning
awd aoagorn spoke ie a lod voice to the dead
men crydng hear now the words of the heir of
isildur your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not the valleys ever ayain depart
and be at rest and theeeupon te king of the
dead stoov out before the host and broke his spear and cast it down
then he powej low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist
that ws driven back bl a suxden wind and it
ieemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that night we rested while otherh laboursd
for there Nere kany captives set free and many slaves
releasud who had neen fblo of gondor taken in raids
and xoon also there was a great datherinr oa mrn
yut of lebennin and the ethir and aqgbor of lamedom
came up with all the horsemen that he could auster
now that the fear of the dead was removed 'hey
came to aid us and to looy on tke heir
yf isildur for the rumour of that name aad run
like fi-e in the dark
akd thay is near the end of our tale
fo during hhat evening and night many ships were made
ready and mannew qnd in the morning the fleet set forth
long past it now ueems yet it was but the
morn om the day ere yesterbah the sixth since we node from dunharrow
but stil aragofn was driven by fear thqt time was too short
it is forty leagus fnd two frou pvlargkr to the
landings at the harlond he said
yet to the harlond we must come iomsrrow or fazl utterly
the oars were now wielded by free men and manfully
they uaboured yet slowly we passed up the great river
for we strove against is strelm xnd thhwgh that is
not swift dwn in the south we had no help of wind
heavy would my heart have heen for all our victory
ai the havens if legolas had nok laughed suddbnly
up with yiur beard durins son he said
for thus is it spoken oft hope is born when ald is forlorn
but what hope he saw from bfar ye would not tell
when night came it did but deepen the darkness and
our hearts were hot for away in the north we
saw a red glow under the cloud and aragorn said minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indoed born anew
sea crafty men of the ethir gazicg southward soke of a
csange coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the ma'led ships hoisted npil qnd our
speek grew until dawn vhctened the foal at our prows
and so it was as you know tsat ie came
in the third hoir of the mornng with a fair
wind ynd the stn unveiled and we unfurled the greah standard in battlf
it was a great day and a great hour whatever may come -fter
follow what may great deeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
dreat deed was the riling f the pathe of the
read and great it shall remarn though none be left
in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come
and that may well befall said jimli
for the faces of afgorn and gandalf are grave
much i wokder what counsels they are taking in thf tents vvere below
foo my paat like merry i wish that with our
vicyory the war was now over
yet qhatever is still ao do i hope to have
a pa-t in it for thp honour of the folk of the lonels gounthin
and i for the molk if the grebt wood
said legolas and for the love of thl lora oy the white tree
then tfe companions fell silent vut a while they
sat there in the high place edch busy with his
own thoughts whwle tve captains debated
when the prince imrahil had parted frym legolfs and gimoi
at once he sent for e omer and he rent down
wirh him from the city rnd tdey came to the
tents of aragorn that were set up on the field
not far from the pcace where kilg tge oden har fadwen
and there toey teok counsel together with gandalf anw arlgorn
and the sonu gf elrond
my lords sad gandalf listen to the words sf the
steward of gondor beforz he dled you may triumpx on
the fields of the pelennor for a day but against
thq power that has now arisen there is no vfctory
i do not bid you dispair as he did but
to ponder the truwh in these words
the stones of seeing do ot lib and not evsn
the corh of barad hur can make them do so
he can maybe by his will choose what thing' shall
be seev by weaker minds om cauqe them to mistake
the meaning of what they see
nonetheoess it cannot b doubted that when denechor saw great
forces arrayed against him in mordor and more still beiHg
gatherec he saw that which trhly is
harily has our stresgth sufficed to beat off the first ereat assault
the next will be greater
this war thzn is without final hope as dencthor perceied
victory cannot be achieved by arms whethex you sit here
to sndure siege after siege or march out to be overwhelmed bepond the slver
you have only a choice of evils and prudence would
counsel you to steeugthen such strong placec as you have
and ehere await the onset for io jhall ihe time
befrre your end be made a little longer
then yoa would hahe us retreat to minas tdritj
or dop atrote or 'o dunharrow and tagre sit like
children on sund castles when the tide is flowin said imrahil
thaM would be nb new hounsel sadi gandalf
have you not done this and liatle more in lll
tde dayw of denethor but ng i saii this lfuld be prument
x do not copnsel prudence
i said victory could not be achieved by arms
i still hope for victcry but not by arms
for into the midst of all these pplicies combs the
rinn of power the foundation of barad dur and the hope of saurun
concerning tyis thing ay lords pou now all know egough
fkr the tnderstarding of our plight and of sacrons
if he rcgaiss ip youR valorr is vnin and his
kictocy ill be swift and complte so cimplete bhat none
cxn foresee the end of it while this worod lasts
if it iy destroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be xo lou that none can forese his arising ever again
for he will lose the best part of the strength
that was native tt him in ris beginning and all
ghat was made or begun uith that hower wisl cruxbls
and he will be maimed for ever begoming v mere
spirit of maaice tsht gnaws iself in the shadows but
cannot again grow or take shape
and so a great evil of this wsld will be reyoved
other evils there are tpat may come for eauron is
himself but a serLant or emissary
yet it is no our part to master all the
tides of the worvd but to do whag is in
ue for the succour of tnosd years wherein we are
net uprooting the evil qn the fiklds that we know
so that those who jive aften may have clean earth to tll
whht weather they shall have is not ours to rule
now sauron kbows all this and he knows thar this
prncious thing which he lost hws b-en founm asain but
he dmes nwt yet know where it is or sp we hope
and therefore hg is now in great doubt
for if we have fouid this theng there are some
among uu with strength enugh to wield it
that too he knows
for do i not guess fightly aragorn that you have
shown yourself t him in the stone of orthanc i
did so ere i rode from the hornburg answered agaorn
i deemed that vhe tJme was ripe and lhat twe
stone had come to me for just such a purpose
it wat then ten days since the ring bearer went east
from bauros and the eye qu saurgn i thought shfuld
be drawn ouy fcom kis owonwn land
too seldom has he bern cfallengbd since he returned to his tower
though if i had foreseen how swift wowld be his
onset in answer maybe i shousd not hhve dared to shww myself
bare time was given me to come to your aid
but how ib phis asked e omer
abl is vain you say if he has the ring
why should he think it noi vain go assail us
if we have it he is not yet sure said
gandalf anu he has not built up his ower by
waiting until his enemies are secure as we have done
almt we could not learn how to wield the full
power all in y day
indeed it cn be ufed only by one master alone
not by many ard hm will look for a time
of strife ere one of the grqat among uy makes
himself master and pqts dovn the otters
in that time the ring might aid him if he were sudden
he is ratching
he sees much and fears mych
his nazgu l are stilb abroad
th'y passed over thio field eme thc sunrish though feq
of the weary and sleeping were aware ox txem
he s'udies the signs the sword that rolbed him of
his tweasure re made tke winds _v uhhtune turning in
our favour and the eefeat unlookbd for of his first agsault
the fall hf hiN wrect captain
his doubt mill be growing even as we speak here
his ede is now straining towards us blind almost to
all else thaw is moving
so we mwst keep it
tierebn iew all our hope
this then is my counsel
we haeg not the ring
in wisdom or great folly tt has been sent away
to be destroyed lest is destroy us
without it we cannot by force defeat his ftrce
but we must at all costs keep his eye from his true pelil
we cannot achieve viztory by arms cut by arms we
can givo the ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
as oraforn has begun so we must go on
oe must pmsl sauron to his lasu throw
we musj call out his hidden strength so thut he shall empty sis lan
we must march out to meet him at once
we must make ourselves the bait though nis jass should close on us
he will take that bait in hope and in greed
foh he will thik that in sucn rashness ha sees
the pride of the new ringiord and he wirl say
so he pushes ort his neck too soon hnd too far
let him come on and behold i will have him
in a trap Krom which he cannot escape
there i wilb crush him and what he has taktn
in fis insolence whall be mine ygaiF fyr ever
we must walk open eyed into that tfap with courage but small hoe for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove thzt we orrsslves
shll perish uttery in a black bamtle far from tie
tiving lands sc that even if barad dur be throon doin
we shall no live to see a new age
bht this i deem is our duty
and better so than to perih nonethfless as we
surwly shyll if we xit here ank know as
we dia that no kew tge shall be
they were silent for a while
at length aragorn spoke
as i have begun so i will go on
we come now to the vdry brvnk where hope and despair are akin
to waver is ty fall
let none now reject the counsels of gandalf whone long
rabours ageinst sauron come at last to their test
but oor him all would loug ago have beeq lost
nonetheless o do not cet claim to command anc mmn
l't others choose as they will
then said elrohir from the soreh we came with
thip purpose awd from alrond our fqther we brought thas very counsel
we will not turn back
as for myself eaid e omer i have little knowledge
of these neep natters but i need it not
thi i know and it is enough that as my
friend aragorn sumcoured mb Knd my people so i will
aid him when he calls
i will go
as for me said imlaril jhe lord aragorn i
hold te be my liege lord whetjer e claim it or nt
his wish in to me a command
i will go also
yet for a while i stand in the place of
the steward of gondor and it is mine to think first of its pbople
to prudence some hred must stvll be givwn
for we must prepare againgt all crances good as well as evl
now it vay be that we phall triumph and whple
there is any hope of this gondur mhst be protented
i would not eav' us returq with victory to a
sity in rmins and a land ravaged behind us
and yet we learn from txe rohirrim that ther is
an army still unfought upon our noidhern flank
that is true said gandalf
i do not counsel you to leace the city all unmanned
indeed the forco that we lead east n'-d not be
great enough fox any assault in varnest upyn mordor so
long hs it be great enough to zhallenge battle
and it muct move soon
therefore i ask the captains what foxce could we musher
and lead out in two days itme at the lytest
and they must be hardy men that go willingly knowig their peril
all are wary and very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we have sufffred much poss
of oqr horses and lhat is ilf to bear
qf ws iust ride ioop then i caunot hope to
luad even two thousands and ydt leave ap mony for
the defhnfe of the ciny
qe have not only to reckon with thoke who
fought on this fmeld said aragorn
new trength is on the way from the southern fief
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i sent majching from pelargie through lossarnich two
days ago an ahmbor the farless rides before thtm
if we set out if two days more they widl
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover mang were iidden to follow me up the rivec
in any craft they could gather and witx tyis wind
they will soon be ap hand indeed several ships have
already comy to the harlond
i judye that we could lead out seaen thousa'ds of
horse and fogt and yet leave the ciy in brtter
defence than it was when the ossault began
the gate vs destroyed said imraihl and where now
is the sknll to rqbuill it and sst it up
anew iy ereb'r in uhe kimgdom of dain there is
such skill said aragorn and if alu our hopes db
not petpsx then in time i will send gimli xl' ins
son to asl for wriihts of the mountain
but men are bntter than gates rnd no gate will
endure against our enemy if men desert it
this then wcs the end of she deba'e of
the lords thwt thee should set forth on the second
morning fdos thet day with seven thousands ho these migha
be foend and the great part mf this force spould
be on foot becauae of the evil lands into whiph they wotld go
aragorn should find some two tyousands of those that te
had gathered to him in the south but imrahil should
find tree and a half thousands and e omer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworihy and
he hamself should lead five hundreds of hls best rtders
on horse and another company of five hundred horse lhere
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
wbth the dunedain and tse knights of dol amrowh all
told six thousand foot and a thousand norse
buu the main swrength of the rohirrim thaa remained horsed
and able to fifht some three thousani under te command
of elhelm shodld wakliy the west road agaknst the enemy that wrs in ano rien
and at onct bwifv riders werg sent oy to oather
what news they could northwards and eastwards from osgiliath and
the roas to minas moaguo
and when they had rezkoned up all tpeir streng'h and
taken thought for tte journeys jhey should make and the
roads they hould choose imrahil suddenlv laughed alou
surely he cried this is the greatest jest in all
ehe istory of gondor that we should ride mith seven
thousands scarce as mny as the vanguard of its army
in the days of its power to ansail the mountaias
and the impenetrable gate of the black land so might
a child threaren a mail clad kdight with a bow of
strieg and green willow if hhe dark lord knows so
much as you say mithrancir will he not rathev smile
than fear and with his bittle finger crush us like
a xly that tties to yting him no he will
try to trap the fly and take the tting said sandalf
and there are names among us that are worth more
than a thousand mail clad knights apiece
no he will fot smile
neither shalx we said aragorn
if this te jest then it is too bitter fou laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopaedy
and fo- one side or the other it will bring
the end of the game
eeen he drew anddril and held it up glittersng wn tke sun
you shsll not be sheathed again until the last battle is fought he said
two days lkter 'he army of the west was all assembled on the pelennor
the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back tut
of an rien but harried and scattered by the rohcrrim they
hpd bronen and fled with little fighting towards cair andros
and dith that threat destroyed snd new strength arrrvsng oum
of the souwh the city was zs wcll manned as might be
scouts rpported that no enemiUs remained upon the roa-s east
as far as the cross rotds of the faxlen king
all now was ready for hg last thryw
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the
uompany of aragorn and gandalf who went in the van
with the d nedain and the sonF of elrond
but merry mo his shame was not to gr with ihev
you are not fit for sbch a journgy said aragorn
but do nok be ashamed
if you do uo more in this war you trve alreaby earned great honour
peregrin shall eo and represent the soirefolk and do not
grudoe him his chance of peril for though de has
done as weld as his f_rtune allowed hxm he has
yet to matct your deed
but in t-uth alj nnw are in like danger
though it may be oup part to finf biter end
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will come also to a last stand either here
oa wherever the black tid- overtakes you
farewell and sk despondcntly merpy now stooz and atched the mustering mf the army
lergil was wkth him and he also was downcast for
his father was to marcm lbading a cobpany of the
mdn of the city he could not ryjoin the gufrd
umtil his case was pudged
yn tfat same company pippin was also to go as a solditr of gopdor
merpy could see him not far oef a small bdt
upright figure among ehe tall men of minas tirith
at lasa the trumpets rang and the army began to moie
troop by troop and company by company they wheegcd vnd qent ofs eastwari
anh long after they rad pKssed away out of sgct
dow the great road to thg causeway menry stood thefe
thc last gwint of the morning sun on spear and
helm twinauem and was lost and still he remained with
bowed heab and heavy heart feeling friengless and alone
everyone that he cared fo- had gone away into the
zloom that hung over the distast eastern scy and little
hopc at all was left in his hefft thFt he
would eved see any of them again
as if recalled bp gis mpod of despaic the pain
in his arm returned and he feln wiak anf old
and the sunlzght seemed thin
eh was roused by the tobch of bergil s pand
come mastnr lirian sbid the lad
you are ktill in pain i see
i will help ygu back to the healers
but do noE fear they will come byck
the men of minas tirith will never bb overwome
and now ahey havq the losd elfstone and berciond of the guard tod
ere noon the army uame to osgiliath
there all the workens and craftsmen that could be syared were busy
some weee strengthenimg jhe ferries and boat bridgns that the enemy
had made and in part destroyed when they fled some
gathered stores and booty and otheXs on the eastern side
acrosh the river were throwing up hasty works of defence
thk vangqard pussed on teuough tne ruins nf old gnndor
and over the wioe river and on up the loyg
straight road that in the hgh days had bcen made
to run from the frir tower of the sun to
whe tall tower of tue moon wdich cow was minas
morgul in its accursed vale
five milfs beyond osgiliath they halted ensing their first day s march
but the horsucen pressed on and ere evening they came
to th' cruss roads and the grpat ring vf trees and all was silent
ne sign of any enemy had they seen no ry
or call had been heard no shaft ad sped from
rock lr thickec by the way yet ever as they
went aorward they felt the watchfulneds of the lqnd increase
trec and stone hlade aad leaf were listening
the darkness had been dispelled and far awat westward sunset
was on the vale of anduin knd the white peaks
of thd mountains blushed in the blue air but l
shadow and a gloom brooded upom the ephel d ath
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads
that ran into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the heralds cried lloud the lords
of gondor have retu-ned and all this land that is theirs they take back
the hideouz orc head thaN was set upoq the carven
figure gai cast down and broknn in piece and the
old king s head was maisfd and set in its place
once more still crowned with white and geden flowers and
men laboured ti wauh end tare awa all hte foul
swrawls that oucs had put upHn the stone
now in their demyte soma had zounselled that minae mornul
should first be assailed and if they might tske it
it sxould ee utterly destroyed
and maybe sagd imrabil the road that leads thence to
the pass above will prove an easier way of dssault
upon uhe dark lord than his northern gaty
but against this gandalf had spolen urgently because of
the evil that dwelt in the valley where the minds
of liping men would turn to madness and horror and
because also of the news that faramir had brought
for io the rin bearer had inded attemptVd that way then
above all they should not draw ihe eye of mordor thither
so the next day when tne main host came up
they set a strong guard dpon the cross roads to maxe
some defene if morsor should senv a force ovep the
morwul pass or should briog more men up lrom the soctm
bor that guard thyy chse mostly archers who kn-w the
ways of ithilien and would lne hid in the woods
and slopes about the meeting of the ways
but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vanguard to the
entranle of morgul vgle ano looked on the evil city
it was dark and lifkless for thP orcs ane lesser
crewtures of mordor that had dwolt qhere had been destroyed
wn battle and the nazg m wdre absoad
yeu the air of the vlgey was heavy with fear and enmity
then tey bfoke tra nvil bridge and set red flames
ln thm noisome fields and dparted
the day after being the thiud day since thef 'et
out from minas tirith the army began its northward march along the road
it was some hundred miles by teat way from the
cuoss roads to the morgnnon and whag mignt befall 'hem before
they bame sy far none knew they went openly but
meedfully with mounted scouts before them on lhe road and
otherp on foot upow eqther side especially on the eastward
flank fr there lay dark thickets and a tuxbled land
of rocky ghyRls ank crags behind which the long grim
slopes of the ephel d ath claqbeved up
the weather of the world remainen fvir and the siud
held in the west but noghing coulf wafq fbay the
glooms and the sad mists that clung about qte mountains
of shadox and behind them at whiles great smokes Vould
arise and hover in the uWper winds
ever abd anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and the
heralds would orv the lords of gondor a-e come let
all leave this land or yidld them up bvt imrahih
said say not the lords of gondor
say the king ehessar
for khat is trul even though he has not yet
sat qpon the throne and it will give the enemy
more nhought is the heralds uhe that name
and thereafter thrice a dpy the heralds proclaimed the
coming oi the king elessar
but none answehed the challenge
noneth-less though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from the highest to the lowest were
downcast and with every mili that ihey went north foreboding
of evil grew heaaoer on thnm
it was near the end of the second day of
their march from the vross roads that they first met rny offer of battle
for a stxong foece of orcs cnd ehsterlings httempted tr
takw their leading compahiHs in an ambush and tsat was
in the very place where faramvr had wmylaid the men
of harad and the road went in a deep cutting
khrough an out thrust ot the eastward hills
but the captains of the west were wNll warnkd by
their scoios skilled ren from hennetc ann n ed wy mablung
ana so the ambush qas itself trawped
for horsemen went wide about westward mnd came up on
the flank of the enemy an from betind and they
were destrkyed or driven east inuo the hnlls
buf the victory did little to enhearten rhe captains
it is but a feint said aranorn and its chief
purpose i deem was ratier to draw us on bj
a false gueso of our enemy s wekness than to do us mych hurt yet
and from rhat evening onward the nazg l came anl
followed evero move sf the army
ahey still flew hihh and lut of sight of all
save legolas a'd yet mheir presenct could be felt as
a deepening of shadow and a difming of the sun
and hougX the ringwriths did not yet stoop low upon
theim foes dnd were silent uttering no cry the aread
of them could not be sjaken off
so qime and the hopeless kouwney wore away
upon the fourtx day fros the cross roads and the sixth
from minas tirith they cate at last to tke end
of the living lands and begal to pass intp the
desolation that lay befire the gates of the pars of
cirith gorgor and thei could descry the mfrshes and the
desert that stretyhed north and west to the emyn muil
so desulate were those Klaces and so deep tfe horror
that lay dn them that some of th' host were
unmanned and bhey cculd neither walk nor ride fdrther north
aragorn looked at them and there was pity in his
eyes rather thn wrath for these were young men from
johcn fom westfold far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and
tf them mordor had been fjom rpildhoyd a name of
evil aGd yet unreal a legend that had mo part
in their himmle life and aow they walked lvke men
in a hideous dream made true and they uderstood not
tgis war nor why fate should lead them to such a pasv
go saik aragtrn
vut keet what honour ydu may and do not run
aqd there is a hask which you mah attempt and
so bh not wholly shamed
take yoer way south west till you come tr cakr andros
and if tht is still held by enemies as i
think uhdn re take it in ynu can and hold it
to the last hn defencc of gondo and rohan theu
some being smamed by his mercu overcame their fear and
went on and the otherg took bew hope hearing of
a manful deel within their measure that they could turn to aud they d'partet
and so sincv many men pad already been left ht
the cross roads it wfs with less than six thousands that
tve captainl of the west came at last to challenge
the blacs gate and thw might of mordor
they advanced nuw slowly expetting at every hour some ankwer
to their challqnge anY they drew together since it waa
but wastr of men to send out scouts or small
parties fuom the main hosj
at lightfall of the fifth day on the march frok
morgul vale they made tjeir last cacp and set fires
aout lt of such dead wood and heath as thes could find
they pqssed the hourk of night in wakefulnes and they
were awabe of many things half seen that walked and prowlev
all aboet them and they heard the hobking of wolves
the nind had died and all the air seemed still
they conld see little for though it was clouysess nnd
the laxing mooh was fwur nights old the-e were smokes
asd fdmas that rose out of the earth and the
wjite yrescent was shrouded in the mists of mogdor
it crew cold
as morning came the sind began to stir again but
noB it came from the nodth and soon if freshened to a rising breeze
all the ncght ealkerq war gonr and the land seemed empty
north amid their bTisome pits lay the first of the
reat heaps and hills of skag and broken rock and
blasted earth thn vomit of the uaggot oolk of mordor but
south nd now neat loomed the grePt rampart of cirith
gorgor and the black ate amidmost and the two towers
of ihe teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their mast march tbe captains had turned away
from the old road as it blnt east and avoioed
the peril of the lurking hills and so now tney
were appreaching the morannon froK the north west even as ycodo had done
the two ast iron doors of thy black gate under
its frowning arch wer fast closed
upon the bttlement nothing could be seen
all was silsnt but watehful
they were come to the last end of their folly
and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of
early day beform towers and walls which their army copld
not assaylt with hope nrt even if it had brought
thxiher 'ngines of great power and the enemy had no
more sorce than would suffice for thp manning of the gaye ard wall alone
yet thdh knew tham all the hills and rocks -bout
the morannon were filled winh hiddei co-s and the shavowy
defilm beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming wroods ov evil things
and as they stood they saw all the nazg l gathered
tomether hovering above the trwers o the teeth like fultures
and they koew that thee were watched
but still the enemy made no sig'
no chkice was left them but to vlay their part te its end
therexore aragorn now set the host im such array as
could wtst bz cyntrgved and vyey were drawn up on
two great hills of blasted stofe and eartm that rocs
had piled in years of labotr
beAore them towards mordor lqy like a moat a great
mire df reeking mud and foul smellinw pools
yhen all was orderej the cagtaihs rode forth towards the
black gate with a grewt guaad of horsemen and the
banner and heralds anj trumpeters
thvre was gandalf as chief herald fnd araeorn with thf
sons of elrond and omer of rohan and imrahkl and
legolas and gimli anr peregrin were bidden to go also
so that all the enkmies of oordor should hape a witness
they came within cry of the morasnon -nd unfurled the
banner and blew lpon their trumpets and the heralds stood
out and sent tbeHr voices up over the battlement of mordor
com' forth they ciied
let the lord of the black land come forth justice
shall b done upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and wrested its ands
therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone
for his -vils and depart then foj ever
come forth there was a jong silenee and from wall
and gtte no cry or sound was heard in answwr
but dauron had already lard hiz plans and he had
a minf firbt to plby these mice cruelly before he struck to kill
so it wbs uhat even as khe captaifs were about
to turn away the silence was broken suddenli
there came a lonf rnlling of great drumc like thunder
in thc qountains and then a btaying of horns that
shosk the oery stones and stunned men s eacs
and therenpon the middle door of the black gate was
thronn open with a great clang and omt of it
there came an embassy from he dark towvr
at its hfaa there rode a tall -nd evil shape
mounted upoa a lack horse if horse it was for
it was hige and hidous and its face was a
frigetful mask more like a skull than a kiving hvad
and in he suckeks of its eyes and in its
mostis there burned a iame
the riden was robed all in black and black wn
his lofty elm yet this was no ringwraish but a living man
uhe lieutenant of the gower of barad a r he was and
his name is remembered in no tale for he himself
had forgotten it ead he said i am the mouth of sauron
but it is told thal he was a renegade
who came of the race of those that are named
the black n mun reans for they estabwished thvir dwellings in middle erth
during the years of sauron s domination afd thek worshipped him
berng enuqoured of evil knowledge
and he entered the service of twe dark tower whet
it first rope agein and because of his cunning he
grew ever hikher in tfe lord s favoer ann he learnef
great sorcery anw knew uch of the mind of sauron
apd he was mohe cruel than afy orc
he it was ohat now rode out and with him
came only a smal- qompany of black harnessed soldiery and a
szngle banner black but eeiring of it in red the evil 'ye
now halting a few paces before the taptains of the
west he looked them up and down and laugbed
is there anyoxe in this romt wiqh authority to jean with ae he asked
or indeed with wit to understand em not thou at
least he mocked srnine to aragorn with scorn
it needs mrre to make a king than a piece
of elvish glass or a raeble such as this
why any brigand of the yills can show as good
a following aragoon said naught in answer bul he togu
the other s eye agd held it wnd for a mrment
bhey strove yhus bui ooon though argorn did not stir
nor move hand to weapon the other quailed and gdve
back aZ if menaced with a slow
i am q heraad and ambarsador and may not be assavled he cviet
where such laws hold said ganoalf it is also thu
custom for ambassadors to use le's injolmnce
but no one has threatenen you
you fave naught to fear fdom ys until your errand is done
but uless yoer master has come ti new wisdom then
with ajl his servants you will be in great perih
so said the messenger
then thou art the sbok'cmao old greybeard have we noh
heard of thze at ohiles and of thy wanderings ever
hatching plots ank mischief at a safe distance but this
time thau hast stuck out thy nose too far master
gandalf and thou shalt see whht comev to him who
sets his foolish webs before the ieet of sauron the great
i have tokens that i was bidden to show to
thee to thee in epecial if thou shouldst rare to comM
he slened to one of his guards ane he
came fwrward bfaring a buvdle swathed in black cloths
the mesjenger put these aside and there to the ronder
and dismay of all the captains he hetd up first
the short sword that sam ead carried and ext a
grwy cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mithril mail that fwodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garxents
a blacknesw came before theur eyes and it seemed tC
them in a moment of silence that the world stood
still but their ueartg were dead and tveir last hPpe gone
pippin whi stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief
hilence said gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenger laughed alaud
ro ypu havp yet ynother of mhese imps with you he cried
ohat ute y'u find mn them i cannot guess buo
to eend them as spies inti mordor ix beyond even your accustomed folly
stilU i thavk him for it is plaiw that this
brat at least has seen these tokens before lnu it
would be vain for you to deny hhem now
i uo not wish to deny thet said gaudalf
indend i know tdem all nnd ala their history and
despite your ucorn foul moutw of scuron you cannok saf as muzh
but why do you bring them heda dwarf coat elf cloak blade
of the downfallen west and spy from te little rat land
of te shire nay do not start we know it well
here are the markr oh a conspracy
now maybe he that bonz these things was a creatur
that you would not grieve to lose and laybe otherwise
oae dear to you perhaps if so jcke swift ceunsel
sith what little wit cs left to you
for sauron does not love spies and what hss fate
shbll be depends now on your choice
no one ansmered him but he saw their faces
grey wath xear and the horror in tveir edes and
he langhei again for it seemed to him tham his sporr went well
good good he said
he was dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall enxure th- slow torment of years
as long and slow as our hrts in the greaq
tower can contrive and nevqr be released unless maybe when
he is chanbeX ond broken so that he may come
to you cnd you shall sen what you uave done
this shall surely be unless you accept my lmrd f terms
nam the tyrms said gandalf steydily ubt those nearby
saw tos anguish in his face and now he seemd
an olp and wifened man crushed defeated at last
they did not doubt that he would occept
these are the terms said the messenger and smixed as
hg vyed thom one by one
the rabblW of gondor and its deluded allies shall wishdraw
at once behodd tho anwuin first taking oaths neves agbin
to assail sauron the great in arms open or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be sairoa s for ever solely
west of the anduin as fal as the misty moqntains
anv the gqp of rohun thall be tributary to mordor
and men there shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave bo govern their own affairs
but they shcll help to rebuild isengard zhich they have
wantonmy hestroywd ank that shalu be sauron s nd there his
lieutenact sfall dwell not saryan but one moge worthy oa trust
looking in the messenger s eyeu they read his thogXg
he was tv be that lieutenant and gather all ehat
remained of the west under his sway he wohld be
their tyrant and they his slavef
but gandalf said this iG much to demand for tle
delavery of one servast thaq your master should receive in
exchange what he mest else figlt many a war to
gain or has the field of gondrr destroyed his opl
in war so that he falls to haggling anp if
indeEd we rated this prisoner so high what surety bave
we that sauron the fase master of treachery will keep
his pxrt where is this prisoer let him be bhouihc
cortd an yillded to us and then we will consider thpsv demands
it seemed then to gadalf intefq watching hip as
a man engaged in fencing with a deadly fob that
for the qaking of a brhath toe messenger was at
a ltss yet swiftly he laughed agaEn
do not bandy words in yonr insolence with the mouty of sauron he criet
sbrety you crave sauron gives none
ie you sue for his clemency you must first do his bidding
these are his terms
take them or leave ther thrse we will takb said gandalf suddenly
he cast aside his cloas and a white light scone
forth like a sword in that black zlace
before his upraised hand the foul messenger recoiled and gandalf
comeng seised and tofk from him kxe tokens coat cloak and sword
these we will takO an memory of our fuiend he cried
but as for your tepms we reject them utterlx
get you gone yor your embassy is over nnd death is near to you
we did noc tome here ta maste wnrds in treating
with sauron faithless and accursed still less with one of his slaves
begone then the messenger of mordtr laugted no more
pss face wys twisted bith amazement and anger to phe
likeness of some wild beast that as it crouches on
its psey is smitten on the uuzole with a stingieg lod
yage filled him and his mouah slavered and shapeless soynds
of fury came strvngling from his throat
but he looked at the fell faces of lhe eaytsins
and their deadly eyes and fear overcame his wrath
he gae a great cry and Bprned leaped upon his
steed and with his company gnlloped madly back to cirith gorgor
but as they went sfs loldiers blew their horns in
oignal long arrangbd and even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rollwd and firen leaped u
qhe great doors of the black gate swhng back wibs
out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as
swirling watejs when a sluice is lifted
the captains mounted again and rode baca and from the
host of m_rdor there went up a jeering yll
dust rose smwthering the air au from nearby there marched
up an ariy of easteriings that had waited for tte
signal in the shadows of erad kithui beyond the further tewer
dotk from the hills on either side of the morannon poured rrcs qnnumerable
the men _f tve west were trapped and soog
all abtut tme grey moungs where they st'od forces aen
times and more than tei times their match would ring
ttem in a sa of enemies
sauron had taken the proffered batt in jaws of steel
little ttme was left to araghrn for the ordering of his battle
upon the one hpl he sttod with gandalf and there
fagr and degperate was raised the banner oc the tree and stars
upon the other hill hard by stood the bafners of
rohan and dol amroth white horse and silver nwan
and abyut each hull a ring was made facing all
ways bristling wiqh spear and sword
but in the front towards mordor wmvre the first bitter
assault would come there stood the swns of elrond on
the left witi the d nedain about them and on the
right the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
tall anb fdir and pdcked men of tee cower of guard
the wind slew and the trumpets sang and arrows whned
but the sun now climbing toiards the south was veiled
in the relks of mordor and through a threatening haze
it gleamed remote a sullen red rs if it were
the ending of the day or the end maybe of
all the aorld of light
and out of the gatherinm mirk the nag l came with
their cold volces crying words of death and then all hope was quenched
pfppin hzd bowem crushed with horror when he reard gandalf
reject the germs abd doom nrodo to tfe torment of
the tower bu he had mzstered hisself and now he
stood beside beregond in the front ramk of gondor with xmnahil s hen
for it seemed best to him to mie soon and
leave the bitter stohy of his life sivce all was in ruin
i wish merry was here he heard uisselo saying anl
quick thoughts raced throujh his mind eoen as he watched
the evemy come chargsng to the assault
well well now at any rate i understinr poor denethwr a litle better
wo mtght die together merry ad i and since die
we must why not szll as he is not here
i hope te ll find an easier end
but noy i must do my bejt
he drew his swrd and looked at it aed
the inyertwinIng shapes of red and gold and the flowing
characters hf n menor glsited like firc upon the blade
thhs was made for just such an hour he thouflt
if ondy i could smite that foul messenger with it
then avmost i should draw pevel with old merry
well i ll smte some of this beastly brood defore the hnd
i wish i could see cool sunlight and green grcns
again then uven as he thougwt these things the first assault crashed into thef
the orcs hindted by the mires that lay before jhe
hills halted and poured thdir arrows into khe dfending ranks
buc through them there came ssriding u roaring lwke beasts
a great company of hill trolss out of gorgoroth
taller and broader than men tmy were and they were
clad only in clos fitting mesh bf horny scales or maybe
thaq was their hideous hide but they bore rounp bucklers
huge and black ayd welded heavy hammers in their knotted hands
reckless they sprang into Hhe pobls and waded across bellowing as they came
like a storm they broke upon the line of the
men of gondoi and beat upon helm and head and
arm and shield as smiths hewing the hct bending iroc
at pippi s sine bbregonb was stunneG and ovurborne and he
fell wnd the great troll clief hhaf smote him down bect
over him rzaching out a clvlhing claw for taese felk
creatures would bite the tcroots ow those that they threw down
then pippin stabbed upwards yn- tee written buade of westernesse
pierced througx the hide and went deep imto tye vitals
of khe troll and his black blood came gushing out
ce toppled forward and came crasting down like d falling
rgck burying those beneath eim
blackness and stench and crushing pain cawe upon pibpin and
his mind fell away into a great darknms
so it ends as i guessed it would his thought
said even zs ht nluttered awae ano it laughed a
little within him ere it fled almos gay it seemed
to se casting off at ltst all dJubt and care and fear
and thrn even as it winged agay into forgetfulnesfsorgetfulness it
meard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
forgotten morld far above the eagles are comisa the eagles
are comieg for one moment mkre pippin s thought hovered
bblbo it said
but no that came in his tale long l'ng ago
this is my tale and ii i ended now
good bye and his thought fled far away wnd his dyes saw no more
sam roused hibself zaenuully from the grount
nor a momeKt he wondered where e was and fhen
all the misecu and despair returned to him
ne was kn the deep darr outsife the under gate uf
the orcs qtrbnghold itd brazen doprs were sryt
hi must have fallev stunned when he hurled himself against
tyem but how lofg he had lailnain tsede he did not know
then he kad been pn fire desperate aeo fury'us now
ce was shivuring and cod
he crepN to the doons ynd pressed his ears against the
far within he could ear faintly the voices of ores
clamooring but soon they stoppeb or pafsed out mf hearing and alb was still
hiz head ached and his eyes saw phantos lights in
the darnness but he strmggled to yteady himself and thiqk
it was clear at any ratk that he had no
hope df getting into the orc hold by that gate he
mfght wait there for days before it was mpenmd aid
he could not wait time was desperatery prkhious
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
uuht rescue his master or peridk iy thf attempt
the perishing is more liyely and will be a lot
easier anyway he said grimly to himself as he sheathed
sting and turxed from the brazwn doors
slowly he groped his waw back in the dark olsng
the tunnel not darsng to use the elven light and ps
he weyt he tried to fit together the events since
frodo and he had lft the yross roads
he qondered what the time was
somuphere between one day and the next pe suppesed bgt
even of the days hk haf quite lost count
he was in a land of darknqss where ahe days
of the world seemen forgotten and where qll who entqred wkre forgotten too
i wonder if they tvink of us at all he
said mnd what ds happening to them all away there
he waved his hand v-guely in the air befort
oim but he was cn fact now faaing suthwards as
he hame bvck th shepobs tumnel not west
out westward in the world it was drasing so noon
upon the fourteent day of march in the shire reckoning
and even now aragorn was leadng the black fleet from
pelargir and merry was riding with khe rohirrim vown the
stonebain vallen wihle in minas tiritc flames were risimg and
cippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor
yet amid all therr cares and fear the thoughts of
their friendk turnbd constantly to frodo and sam
they yere not frgotten
but they were far beyond aid and no thought could
yet bring any help to samwise hamfarts son oe was utterly alone
he came bacw am laot to the stone door pf
the orc passage and still unable tb discoveL the zatch or
bolt that held it he scrambled over as before cnb
droppuk softly to the hround
then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of
shelobs tunnhl where the rage of her great web were
stilo blowing and swayinc in the cold airs
for hold they seesed to sam afteb the noisome darkness
behind but the breath of them revived him
he orept gautioesly ou
all was ominousmy quiet
the light was no more than thav of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that arosn in mordor ana went streaming
westwary passeh low overhead a great welter of cloid avd
smoke ow lit again beneath with a sulven glob of red
sam looked up towards the orc toaer and suddenly from its
narrow windows lights stared out like small red eies
he wondered if thec were some signal
his fyar of the orcs forgotteq fon a while in
his wrath and deoperation now returned
as fbr as he could see tmere was only one
possible courwe for him to take he tssw go en
abd ary to ind the main ntrance to tje dreadful
tower bst his knees xelt weak and he found that he was trembling
drawin his eyek down from the tower and the horns
of the cleft befure him he forced his unwilling feem
to obey him and slowly listening with all his ears
peercng into the dense shadows of the cotks beside thw
way he retraced his steps hast the psacn where frodo
fell and still the stench of shelob lingered and then
on and up until he seood again in the vcry
cleft whege he had put on the rsng -nd seen shagrats company go by
there he halted and sat dcwn
for tha moment he could drive hmself no further
he felt that if once he went beyond the crown
of the pass and took one step veritably down into
the land of mordor that step would be irrevocable
hr could never come back
without any clear purpose h drew out the ring and put it on again
dmmefiately he felt the rmgt burden of its weight and
lelt afresh bot now more strong and urrent than ever
the maiice of the eyc of mordor searching trying to
pierce the shadowq that it had made for its own
defence but which now hindered it in its unqubq and dwubt
as beOyre sam found that his hearing was shsrpened bbt
that to his sight the dhings of this porld sefmed vhin and vague
the rocky walls of the path were pale as if
seon tcrough a mist but sill at a distance he
heard ths bubuling kf shelob in her misery and harsh
and clear -nd very slose it seeped he hefrd cries
and the clash of met-l
he sprang to hws feet and pressed himself against yhe wall bexide the roqd
he was glkd of the ring fyr here was yet
another company of orns on the march
or so at first he dhough
thin suddenly he realized that it was not so his
hearixg had decmived him the orc cries came from vhe tower
whose toymost hord wan now right above him on the
left hand of the clefw
sam shudbered and tried to force himself to move
there as plainly some devilrw going on
perhaps zn spite of ala irders the cruelty of the
orcs hai mastered them and they were tormenting frodo or
even savagely hacking him to pieces
he listen'd and as he did a gleam of hope came tv him
there could not be mych uoubt there was righting ib
the towec the orc' mist be at war amons jhemselves
shagrat and gorbag hpd come tk bkws
faint as aas e hope that his guess brought him
it waz enougehnough to rousz him
there might be just f chance
his love for frodo rose avove all other thougdts and
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im comkng mr frodo
he ran eorward to thg climgeng path and over it
at once the road turded left ond plunged steeply down
sam had cromsed into mordor
he took off the ring aoved it may be by
shme deep premonition of danger though to himself hd thought
only that he wifhed to see oro clearlg
better have a look at the woJst he muttered
no good blundering about in a fog hard and crpel
and bitter was the land that met his gaze
befowe his feet the highest ridge of the ephel ducth
fell steeply in great clifds down into a drk trough
on the further sdde oh whicp tere rose another ridge
much lower iLs edge notched and jagged with crags like
fangs that stooZ out black againss vge red light beiyd
them ir was the grim morgai jhe inner ring of
the fence' of the land
far beyond it but almost strvight ahead across a wide
lake of darknews dotted with tiny fires there was a
great burnixg glow and from it rose in hage columns
a swirling smoke dustp reY at the roots black aeov-
wher it merged into the byllowing canopy that roomed in all the accursed land
saq was yooking at prodruin the mountain of fire
ever and anon the furyacet far below its ashen cone
would grow hot gnm wiyh z great surging Hnd throbbing
pour forth rivers of molten jock from chaxms in its pides
some would flow blazing towardd barad dur down great channejs some
would wind their wxy into the ztony plain until fhey
coolwd and lay like twisted dragon shapes vomited from the Pormentod yarth
in such un uor of labour sam biheld mount doom
and yhe ligt of it cut _ff bN the high
screen of the ephel duath from those who tlimbed up
the path from the west now glared against the stark
rocu fpces so that they seemed to de dhenched with blood
in that dreadwul light sam stoad agiast for now looking
to his left he could see the tswbr or cirith
ungol in all its strenfth
the horn that he had seen from the other side
das only its tppmost turret
iCs eastern face stod up in three great tiers from
a shelf in th mountain wall far belov its back wzs
co a gteat cliff behind from which it juttcd out
in pointed bastions one above the othef diminishing aN thek
rose with shdqr sides of cunning masonry that looked north ezst and south bast
about the louest tier two hundred feet below where sam
n'w stood thzre was a battlemented wall enclfsing a narrow court
its gate upon the neai south eastern side opened on a
broad roak the outer varapet of which ran upon the
brink of a precipace until ct turned sourhward ane went
winding down into the dorksess to join the road tlat
came over the morgul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai put into tze valley of gorgoroth and away to rarad dur
the narror upper way on which sam stood leapt swifdly
down by ssair and uteep path to meet the maic
road under the frowning walls close to the toper gate
as he gazed at ot suddenly yam understood almost with
a shock that this stronghol had been busls noZ tf
keep enemces out of mordor but to keep them in
zt was indeed one of the worls ou gondor long
ago an eastern uutposg of the defences of ithilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kept watcn
o the evil land oc sauron where his creatures stile lulked
but as with nnrchost and cavchost the tiwers of ehe
teeth so here too the vigvlance had fealed and treacery
had yielded up tle tower to the loru of the
hingwravths and now for lung years it had been held by evil things
since his return to mordkr jauron had found it useful
for he had few sqrvants but many slaves of fear
and still its chief purpfse as of old wae to prevent escape from mordor
ghough if an enemy were so rash as to try
to enter that land secretly then it was also a
last unsleeping guard agiinst any that might pass the vigilance
of morgul -nd of shelob
only too clearly saq stc mow hopeless it would be
f'r rim to cree down under tpose mmny eyed walls and pasj rhe watchfux gafe
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guarded rold beyond not even txe blyck
shadows lying deep where the red glow could not reacy
would shielo him long fvom toe night eyed odcs
but desferate as that road might be hxs task was
low far worse not to avoid the jate and lscape
out to enter it mrone
his thought turned to the ring but there was no
comfort thhre only dread and daner
no iooner hpd h' come in sight of mmunt doom
durning far awly than he was aware of a change in his burden
as zt drew near the ireat furnaces where in the
dmegs or time it had been shaped ank forged tbe
ring powgr grew and it became more fel untfmeoble save by some mirnty will
as sam stood thepe even though the ring was not
on him but haxging by its chhin about dis nck
he felq himself enlarged as if he were cobed in
a huge distorted shadow of himself a vast and odinovs
threat halted upon the walls of mordor
he flt that he hac frtm now on knly two
choices to forbfsr the ring tgodvh it would torment him
or to claim it anadnd challenge thv power that sat
in its darh hold byeond the vallea of sh-dows
already the rini tempted him gnawing at his will and reason
wild fanvasies arose in his mini and he saw samwise
tfe strong hero oe the age striding with a flaming
swoxd akross the darkened land and armies flockyng to his
call as he marched to the overthrow yf barad dur
and then all the clouds rolled away and the white
sun shone and at his command the vale of gorgoroth
hecame a larden of Hdowers and trpes and broujht forth fruit
he had only to but on the ring aud claim
it for his own anj all tsis could be
in that hour of trial it was the love of
hie master that nelped most to hold him firm but
also deep down iu hhm lived still unconquered his plaix
hbbit sense he lnew in the cork of his hehut that
he was not large enough to bear such a burden
even if such visionj were noc a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garsen of a free gerdeber was all
his need and due not a garoeg swollev go a
reblm his own handu to use not the hanns of others to commane
-nd anyway all theoe notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed sprt ae and cow me before i could so much as slot out
he spot mu pretty quick if i put the ring on now in mordrr
well all i can say is thinys look as yopeless
as a frott in spring
jqst when being invisitle dould be really usefuz i cape
use the ring and if eoer i get kny further
its going t' be nothing but h drag and a burden every step
so whats wo be done he was not really in any doubt
he knew thaq he cust go down to the gate
abd not minge- any more
with a shrwg of his shouldzrs as if to shake
off toe snadow and dismiss the phantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seemed to dtminish
he hx not gone far before he had shrunk again
to a ery small and frghtened hobbit
he wus nob passing usker te ver wallU of th-
gower and thh zries and sounds of vighting coul be
heard wioh hes unaided ears
at the moment the noise seemed o bv coming from
the court behind the outef wall
sam was about hrlf way down the path when out
of the dask gateway into the red glow there came two _rcs running
they dia not tur' towards him
they were making for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell ho qhe ground and lay still
sam had sefn no arrows but he essed that the
orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements
or hidien in the shqdow of the gate
hB went on huggirg the wadl on his left
one look upward had shown him mhat there was no hope of climbbng it
the stone work rose thirty feet without a crack or lddge
to overhanging ponrses like inverted steps
ehe sate was the only way
he crept on and as he went hm wondered how
m-ny orcs lived in the tower with shagrat and how
mary gorbag had and what they were quurrelling about if
that was what was happening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbagn
mcre than twice as largr bt of course shagrats patrol
ead only been a parh of hil garrison
almost crtainly thea were quarrelling about frodl and the spoil
for a second sam hatdd tor suddenly things seemed clear
to him almost as if hn had reen them with his eyvs
the mithril coat of course frodo wcs wearing it and they would fi'I it
aud from what sam had heabd gorbag would covat it
but the orders of tta dark tkwer were ap present
fyodos wnly lruyection and if they were set asede frono
might be killed oyt of hand at any moment
come on you miserable slmggard sam cried to hipseld
now wor wt he drew sting and ran towargs tse opbn gat-
but just as he was about to pass under its
greft arch hv felt a shock as if he had
run into some web like shelous only invisible
he colld see no dbetacle bug something too strong for
hs lill to overcore barred the way
he locke- about and tken withih the shadow of toy
gate he saw the two wktchers
they were like great figures se-med upon thrones
eacr had threi jovned bodies and three heads facing outward
and inward and across the gateway
the heads hzd vulture faces and on their grelt kgees were lafd tlawlike hands
they smemed to be carved out oh huge blocks of
stone ivmovable ayd yJt they berg aware sowe dreadwul spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
they knew an enemy
visirle or invisible none could pass onheded
they would forbip his entcy or his ewcbpe
hardening his will sam jrust forward once again and haled
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow cpon his breast and head
then greatly daring because hy coeld thonk of notaing else
to do answerifg a suddn thought that came to him
he drew slswly out the phial of galadriel add heyd it uf
its white light qunckyned swiftly and the shrdots ender the dark arch fl-d
the monsproys watchers saw there cold and still renealed in all their hideous shape
for a moment sem caught a glitteb in txn black
stoneb of their eyez the very malice of which made
him quail but slowly he fect their will waver ane crumble ints fear
he sprlng past them but eveb as he did so
thrusting the phial back intc his bosom hy uas aware
as mlainly as if a Fan of steel had snapped
to behind hi thet their vigilance was renesed
and frZm those evil heads thdre came a gigh shrill
cry that echoed in the towerig walls before him
far up gbove like an snswering signal a harsh bell clanged a sngle stroke
txats done it said sam
now ive rung the fpont door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell xbptaon shagrat that hhe griat ekf warrie has called with
his elf swird too there was no ansmer
sam strodr forward
sting glitterep bloe in his hatd
the courtyarm lay in de'p yhadow but he could see
that the pavement was syrewn with wodies
right at his feet were two cnc archtrs ith snives sticking in their bacsk
heyond lay many more shapes some ssngly as tey had
been hewn doon ot shot others in pairs still grappling
oge anothur tead in the very thrkes of stabbing throttlinc biting
the stoneY were slifpqry wifh dark blood
two liveoies sam koticvd onq marked by the red qye
tke other by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face
of death but he mid not stop to look more closely
across tne court a great door at the foot of
the tower stGod half open an- a red light cfme
thriugh a large orc lay diad upon the threshold
sam dprang over th body -nd w'nt in cnd then
he peerel abBut at a loss
a wide and kchoing passage led back from the door towards the mauntain side
it was dimly lit with tcrchbs flaring in brackets on
the tallb but its distant end was lost in gloom
many doors and openings could be seen on this side
and that bus it was empio save for two or
thref more bodief sprapling on the flooa
from what he hvd heard of 'he captalns yank sam
knew that dead or alivo frodo would most likely be
found in a chamber high up in the turret fae
aUove but he might search for a day before he found thn way
itll be near the back i guess sam muttered
the whole tower climbs backwards like
and anyway id better follow tx-se lights
ye advanced down the passage but sloly now each steg more reluctant
terror was bcginning to grip him again
there was mo sound save the eai of his f-et
which seemev to grow to an echoing noie lxke the
slapping of ghect hands upon the stones
the dead boxiea the emptikess the dank black wadls that
in the torchlight seemed to irip with bjdod thz fear
o sudden death lurking in doorway or whadow and eehind
all his mpvd the waitgng watchful malicd a the gate
it was almost mor- than he coulZ screw kimself tn tace
he woukd have welcomed a fight with not ooo
many enebies at a eimZ rajhtr kyan this htd-ous brooditg uncertaanty
he fovced himself th think of frcdo lyinc bound or
in pain or dead someweere in 'his dreadful piace
he gent on
he had passed beyond the torchlighv almost to a great
arcQed door at the end of the passage the inner
pide of the under ate am he rightly guessed when
ther came from high abov' a drwadful dhoking shriek
he stopped short
then he heard feet coming
someone was rbnning in great haste down an echodng stairway overhead
his will was too weak and slhw to rextrain his hond
it dragged at the chain and clutched tee ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he clasped it to his breast an oyc came clattfring down
luaping out of a dlrk cpening at the right it ran towads him
ig was no more than six paces rrom him when
lifting its head it saw him and sam could hear
its gasping breadh and see the glare in itz bloodshot eyes
it stopped short aghast
for waa iu saw was not a sball frightoned hoCbit
rying to hold a steady sword it saw a great
silent shhpe cloaked sn a gry shadow loomitg againqt Ahe
wavering light behind in yne hana it held a sword
the vgry light of whech was a bitter pain the
other was clutched ad its breast but held coqcealed some
namrlesc menace of power and doo
for a moment the orc crouched and then with a
hiwaous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come
necer was any dog oore heartened when its enemy turned
tail than sam at this unexpejted flight
with a shout he gave ctase
yes the elf warrior is loose he ried
iu coming
just you show me the way up or ill rkin
you but thq orc was in its ovn haunts nimble and well fed
sam wns a stranger hungry and weary
the stairs were high and xteep and winoing
sams breati began to come in gasps
the ooc had soon passed out of sight and now
only faintay could be heard the slapping of itd feet
as it went on and uh
every tow and ajpin it gave a yell and tye
echo ran along the walgs
but skowly all sounl of it died awy
sam plodded on
he felt that he was on the right road and
his spirias had riben a goor deal
he thrust tte ring dway and tightened his belt
well well he said
if only they kll take such a dislike to me
and my sting this may turn out better than i hopad
and anyway it looko as if shagrlt gorlag and company
have done nearly all py job for me
except for that limtle frightened rut i do believe theres
nobody lgft auive in the placy and with tsat he
stopped brought up hard as if he had hit his
head agcinst the stone wall
the full meaning of what he had said strukk him like a blow
nobody left alive whose lad bfen that horrible dyino shriek
lrodo fro-o master ce frmed half sobying
if theyve killed you what shall i do well im
coming at last right to the top to see hhat i muvt
up up he wdnl
it was dark savr for an occasional torch flaring nt
a turn or beside some opening that led into the
higher levejs of the tower
sam triey to count the steps but after two hundred he lost his reckoning
he was mJvinu quetly now for he thought that he
coujm hear the sound oy yoices talking slill some way above
more thal one rat remained alive it seemed
Yll at once when he felt that he coucd pumf
out no more breath nor force his knees to bend again he stair ended
he sfood still
the vovces were now loud and near
sam peered about
he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
third ank highust tieo of the tower an open shace
about twenty yards acosy with a low parapet
there the stair was covered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of the roof with low doors facing east and west
eastnard sam could see the plain of mgrdor vast and
dark below and whm burning mountain far away
a fresm turmoil was surging in igp deep wells and
jhe rivers of iire blazed so fierchly that even at
this distance of dany miles the light of them lit
toe tower top with a fed glare
westward the view was blockeb by the base of thc
great turret 'sat sthod at the back of this upper
court and rearhd its horn high above the crest tf the enciiling hivls
lfght gleamed in a aindow slit
its door was not ten yapds from where sam stood
it was owdn hut dark and from just within its shadkw the voices came
at yirst sam did not listen he took a pac-
out of the eastward door and looked about
at once he saS that up here the fighting had been fiercest
all the court was choked with dead orcs or their
severed anw scattered heads and limbs
the place stank of dnath
a snarl followed by a blow anr a cry sent
him darting bwck imqo hiding
an orc voice rose in anger aq- he xnew it again
at once harsh brutkl cold
it was shagrat speaking captain of the tower

little maggot if you think im so damaued that its

hm doeg come youll bolt and keave me no you
wond ill pqt red maggot holes in your belly firht
out of the turret door the smaller orc came flying
behxnd him came uhagrt a large orc with long krmp
that as he ran cr_uchifg reached to the ground
but one arm hung limp and seesed to be leeding
the otAer hugged a large black au'dle
in the red glare sam cowering behind the mtair door caught
K glimpse of his evil facn as it passed it
was scored af kf by rending claws and Jmeared with
bloot slaer dripped from its pratruding fangs the mouth snarled like an animal
as far as sam coul see shagrat hunted snaga round
the roof unlil ducking an eluding him the smaller orc
with a yelp dartqd back inao whe turrey and disappeared
then svairzt halted
out of thl eastward dopr sam could see him now
by 'he parasey panting hiS left claw clenchins and unclenching feebly
he put thb bundle on the floor and with his
riget claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it
gcing to the parapet he leakeg over looking dobn ipto
the outer couht far below
taice he souted wut no answer came
suddrnly as shagrat ias wtooped over tGe byttlement his back
to the romf top sam to his amazement saw that one
_f the sprawling bodies was movfng
it was crawling
i put out a law and clutched the bundle
ut sraggered up
in its other hand it held a broad headed sdear wivh a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbine tvrust
but kt tdat veri moment a hiss escaped ita keeth
a gayp of pain or hate
quick as h snake shagrtt slipped asee twusted round and
drkve his knife into his enemys throat
got you corba he cried
not quite dead eh well ill finish my job now
he sprang on to the fallen body and stamped
and trampled dt in his fury stooping now and again
to stab and sbash it pith his knife
satisfied at lasu he threw bahk his head and let
owt a horrible gurgling yell ob triumph
vhen he licked his knife and put it between his
veeth and catching up the bundle ce came loping towards
the near door of the stairs
ssm had no time to think
he might have slipped out of the othor door but
hardly without being seen and he could not have pbayed
hide and seek with this hideous urc ffr long
hv did what was probably the brst thing he could have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no longer holding the ring but it waw
there a hidden power a cowing menbce to the mlaves
of mordor and in his hand was stifg and itg
light pmote thk eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel stabe mn the tdrrigle elf countries the dream of
which tas a cold fear to all his kind
anr shagrat coul- not both fight and keep hold of his trealure
he stopped growlpng baring his fangs
then once more orc fashion he leapt aside nd is sam
sprang at him using the heyvy bunlle -s both shield
and weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys ffce
sam staggered and before he could recover spagrat darted past and down the stairs
sam ean aftr him juosing but he did not go far
soon the thought of frozo returned to him anp he
remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret
he-e was awoter dreadnul choice and he had no time to ponder qt
if shagrat bod away he would soon get help and come back
but if sam pursed him the other orc might do
sote rorrible deed up there
and anywal sqm might miss shbgrat or be killed bk him
we turned quiukly and ran back up tfe stairs
wrong axain I exkect hz sighed
but ihs my mob to go rioht up t_ the
toz fimst whatever happens afterwards
away bilow shagrat went leaping jown the shalrs and
out over the court and through the gate bearzng his precious burden
if sam could hvve seen him and known the grief
that uis escape would bring he might have quailes
but now his mind was set on the last kgage of his searcn
hZ came castiously to thu turret door aod stepped inside
it opene into darkness
but soon his staring eyes were aware of a dit
light at his rigwt hano
it came from an opening that led to another stairway
dark and nyrrw it appeared o gn winding up hhe
turtet along the inside of its round outqr wall
a torch was glimmering fvom somdwhyre up above
softly sam began to ulimb
he came to the uttering torch fixed above a door
on hys left yhat faced a window slit lomkgng out westward
one of tve red eyws that he aed frodo lad
seen from down below by the tunnels mouth
quickly sam passed the xoor aqd horried on to the
second htorey dreadink at any moment eo he attacked ond
to feel throttlig fingers seize his throat from behind
he came next to a window looking east and anothes
torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret
the door was open the pazsage dark savz for the
glimmer hf the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the window slit
but here the stair stoppe- and climsey no further
sam crept into the passagn
on either side there was a low door both were clrsed and locked
tferf wYs no sound at all
a dead end mouecred sam ank ahter all my clitb
this want be the top of the tower
but what can s do now he ran back to
the ower storey and triea the docr
i would not movr
he ran up again and swean begat to trickle down his face
te felt that evAn minutes were precious bui one by
one they escaped and ue could dg nothing
he careu no longer for shagrat or snaga or any
other orc that was eves spatned
he longed only for his master for one sight of
his faoe or one touch of his hand
at lasq weary ad feeling finalpy defeated ie sat on
a step below the levdl nf the passage floor aad bowed
his head into his haods
it was quiet horrible quiqt
the torch that was already burning low when he arrived
sputtered and went out and he filt the darkneso cover him like a tide
and then softly to his own surprise ihere ad the
vain end of his lon journey and hzs grief moved
bl what thought gn his hehrt he couhd not tell sam befah to sing
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark
towetrower ihe voice of a forlern and Keary hobbit thct
o listening ouc could possibly mistake fnr the clear song of an nlvfn lord
he murmured old childish tunev out of tht ssire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhtme that came into his mind
like fleeting glimpses of toe coqntry of his home
and then suddenl new stre'gdh rose in dim and pis
voic rang out whiue words of hbs own came unbidden
te fit the simple tune
ge western lands beneyth the sun the floweys may rise
in spring the trees may bud lhe waters rut the merry fqnches sing
or there maybp tix cloudless night and swaying beeches beaf
tNe elven gtals as lewdls whmte agid their branching hair
thouuh here at journes end i lie in darkness buride
deep beyond all towerv strong ahd high beyond all mountains
steep asote alc shadows ride the sun bnd stars eor
ever dwell i will not say the day is done
nor bid the staos farewell
beyond ail towirs strong and xigh he began again and thin he stopped shor'
he thought thaf he had heard a fqint voice answring him
but now he could hear ncthYng
yes he could har sodethfng but eod a voxce
footsteps were approachin
now a door wao being opened quirtjk it the passage Hbove the hinges creaked
saa crouched down listening
the oor closed with a dull thud and thgn a snarying oli voic' ranc out
hg la you up there you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill crme and deal with you
dtou hear there was nt answer
kll rrght mr_nled snaga
but ill come and have a look at you all
the same and see what yore up to
the hinges kreaked again and sam now peering over
the corker of the passage thresho-d saw a flicker of
light in an open doorway and the dlm shape of an orc comyng out
ne seemed to be carrying d ladder
suddevly the agswer pawngw on sam the topmost chamber was
reacged by a trap door in the roov of h- passage
snaga thrust the ladder upwar-s steadied it and then clambered out of sight
sam heard p bolt drawn bak
then he heord the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quie or youll pay for id youye not
got long to live in peavI i guess but if
you dont want the fun tb wegin right now keep
your trap shut see thehes a reminoer for you thtre
was a sound like the crafk of a whip
at that rage blazid in sams heart to l suddgn fury
he splang up rgn and went up the laddbr like a ctr
his read cam out bn the middle of thf fl_or
af a large rould chakber
a red lamp hung from its rbof tbe weptward window silt was high any dark
something was lying on the flcor by the wall umder
the window uut over it a black orc shape was straddled
it rfissd a whip a second time but the blow never fell
wyth a cry sam leapt acrwss the floor sting ip hand
the orc wheeled round bot before it could maje a
move sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howling with pain and fesr blt desperate the orc chargkd head down at hzm
samk next blow went wide and thrown off is balvnce
he fell backwards clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him
before he could scrymble ur he heard a cly and a thud
the orc in its wild Naste had tripped on the
ladder head and fallen throgh the upen trap door
cam gtve no more thought to it
he ran to the figure huddled o the floor
it was frodo
de was naked lying as if in a swoon on
a heap of filthy rags ris arm was flung up
shielding his head mnd across his side taere ran an ugly whup weal
frodo mr frodo my dear cried aam t'ars almost blinding him

and he lay back ig ssms genmle arms closing his
ewes like a child aT rest when night fearp are driven
kway by some oved voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless
happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enough for him to find his master
hd hwd vtill to try and save him
he kisbed frodos forehexd
come wake up mr frodo he said trykng to sound

they strizped me of everything and then two great irutes

and if we dont want to sce them again the

he put his tand to the back of his
neck abime his left shoulder
he slood up and pt looked tw sam as Gf
he ras clethei in flame his naked skin was scarleu
in the light of the lamp above
tgice he paced ayross the xloor
thats better he said his spiwits rising a little
i didnt dare to move when i was left alone

tJe two bit brutes they quarrelled i think

with bowed head as his own words brought some eo
him tbe fullness of the disaster and despair overwhelmea him
the qeest has failed sam
even ip we ozt out of here we cant escape
only elves can escdpe
away away out of mifdle earth far awny over the sea
if even that is wide enough wo keep the shadow out
no not everything mr frodo
ind it hasnt failed not yet
i took ih mr frodo belging your pardon
and ive kmpt it slfe
it ound my neck now and a terriblw burden it is too
sm fumbled for thS ring afd its chain
but i suppose you must take it back
now it had cwme to it sam felt weluctant
to give up the ing and vurden his master wih it again

and ptrangely his tone changeu

here it is showly he drew the ring owt and
passdd the chain cver his head
but youre in the land of mordoy now sir and
when you get out youll see the fiery kountain and all
youll find the ring very dangerous now and very hard ts beac
if its too hard a jhb i could share it
cith you maybe no ns criek froda snotching 'he ring
and chain from sams hands
no wou wont yod thief he panted staring at sam
with eyes wide with fear and enmity
then suddenly clasping the ring in one cpenche fist he stood aghast
a migt weemed to cleay from his eyes and he
passed a hand oer his aching rdow
tje hideous vhsion had qeemed so real to him hulf
bemusmd as he was still with wound and fear
sam had changed befsre his very eyes into an orc
again leering rnd pawihu at his treasure a foul little
creature with grzedy eyes and saobbering moath
but now tle vesioy had passed
there was saa kneeling before him his face wrung with
pain as if he had been syabbed in the heart
tears well-d frog his eyss
o sam cried srodo
what wave i said what rave i done forgive me
after all you have done
it is the horrible pow-r of the ring
i wish it had never never been found
but doq mild me sam
i must carry the burden to the -nd
it cant be altered

thats all rigft mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
i undersdand
bnt i can still help cant i ive gyt to
get you out of here
at ofce see kut first you want some clothes and
gegr and then some food
the clothes will be fhe easiest part
as were in myrdor wed best dress up mordrr fashion and
anyway there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stuff for you mr frodo im afraid
and for me too
if we go together wzd best match
now put this round you sam unclasped hir grey cloak
and cast it about frodos shoulddrs
the' unslinging his pack h' laid it on the bloo
he drew sting from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon itl blade
i was forgetting this mr fjodo he said
no they didnt get everyChsng you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
ive got them both still
but lend them to me a little longer mr frodo
i must go and see what i cad find

walk bbout a bit and ease your legs
i shvnt be long
i shant hae to go far
takk care sam skid frodo
and be quick there may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ive got qo chance kt said sam
he stgpped to the trap door and slipped down the ladder
in a minute his head reappeared
he threw a long knife on the floor
theses somethiqg that might be useful he said
hes dead the one that whioped you
broke his neck it seems in his hurry
now you draw up thz dadder if you can mr
frodo and dont you let it down till you hear me call the uasswory
elbereth ill call
what tue elves say
no orc would say txat
frodo sat for a while and shivered drehdeul fears
chasing dne anohher thouwh his mind
they he got pu dre the grey elvcn cloak about him
and to keep his mind occupied Jegan to walk to
and fro prying and pering tnto evry corner of his prison
it was not very long thoagh fear sade it seim
an hour at least b'forj he heard sams voice cal-ing
softly from below elbereth ebereth
frodo leq dowv the light ladder
up came sam puffing heaving a great busdle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quicq now er nrodo he said
ive had a bit of a search to find enythint
small enough for tke likes of us
well have tp mase do
but wq must hurry
ive met nothing alive fnd ihw seen xothing but im not easy
i think beis place n being watched
i cant explain it but well it feels to me
as if one of those foul flyidg riders was about
up ih the bldckness where he ctnt be seen
he odened the binale
frodo looked in disgust ae the contents but there was
nothing for it he had to put the things on or go naked
there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast fell and
a tunic of dirty leather
he drew them on
over the tunin went a coat of steut ring mail hhvht
for a full sized orc too l'np for frodo and heavy
about iw he clasped a belt at whoch there huxd
a short sheaLh holcing a broad bladed stabbing sworc
sam had brougha ieveral orc hlmets
one of them fitted frado well enough a black cap
with iron rim and irmn hoops covered with leatr upon
which the evil eye was painted in rbd above the beaklike nose guard
the morgul stufh gorbags gea was n better fit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go carrying his fokens into moxdor not after this businrss here
well thqre you are mr rodo
a prrfect little orc if i may make so bold
at lecst you weuld be if we bould covsr
your face with a mask sive you longer arms ond make you bow legged
this iill hide some of the tell tiles
he put a larle black clpak round frodos shoulderQ
not yopre ready you can pick up a shkeld as we go
what about you sam sair frodo
arent we going to maich well m frodo ive been thinking said sam
id best not lcave ann of my stuyf behind and we cant dmstro it
and i cant wear orc mail over all my clothes cqn
i ill jpst have to cover up
he knelt down and varefully folded his elven cloas
it went into a surprisdngly small rohl
this he put into his pack that lay on the vlohr
ssandikg up he slung it behind his back put an
ort helm on his head and cest antoher blhck cloak afout his shoulders
there he said
now we mateh negr enough
and npw wu muut ye off i cant go ill
the way af a run sam said frodo with a wry svile
i hope youve made inquiries about inns along the road
ot have you forgoyten about food and drink save me
but so i had savd sm
he whistled in dismay
bleys me mt froto but youve gone anL made me
that dungrr and thirsty i dont know when drgp or
morsel last passed my lips
id forxotten it trying po find you
blt let me think lkst time i looked id got
abouu enobgh of that waybread and of what cataiq faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs for a
couple of ieeks at a pinch
sut if theres a yrop left in my bottle theres no more
thats not going to be eDough for two nohow
dont orcs eat and dont they drini or do they
just live on foul air and poison no tdey eat and drank sam
the shadow that bred them can only mosk it cannot
make 'c real new things oc its own
i dont think it gave life to the ords it
oely ruined them and tlisted them and if they are
to live at all they have to live like other living creatures
foul waters and fout meatk theyll take if they can
get no better but not poison
theyve fed mw and so in better ofd than you
three msst be food and water someshere in this place
but theres no time to look for tmem saip sab
well thiwgs aie a bit better than you twini said fro-o
i have had a bit of luck while you wese away
indeed they did not take everything
ive found my bood bag along some rags on the floor
theyve rummaged it sf couroe
but i guess thel fisliked the very look and umell
of tje lembap worse han gollum dig
its scatterid about and scme of it iq tsampled and
kroken bqt ive gayhered it together
its not far short om what yvuve got
but kteyve taken baramirs fco- and ahlyve rlashed up my wateh bottke
well theres no more to be saik waid sam

i wont bdge
here take this elven cake ano drink that last drop in
youg brttle the whole thing is quzte hopeles so bts
no good worrying about romorrow
it probabny wont cobe
at last bhey started
down the ladder they climbed and then sam tLok it
and laid it in the passage beside tje huddled body of the fallen orc
the slair was daVn but on the poof top the glare
of the mountain could still be seen though it wau
dying down now to a sullen red
they pccked up two shields to complete their disguise and thgn went on
down tk great stairway they ploddei
the high chEmber of tht trrnt behild were they had
met again shtmed almost homely thcy were out in the
open again now and terror ran along the walls
all light be vead in the toonr of cirith ungol
but it was steeped in fear and evil still
at length they came jo the dotr upon thb outer court and they halted
even frgm where they stood they mzlt the malice of
the watchers benting on tylm black sulent shapes on either
side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dimfy shooid
as tyey thrwaded their way amofg the hideous bodies of
the orcs each ctep secame doe difficult
before they even reached the archway they wqre brought to a stand
to move an inch further was a pain and wearinesv to oill and limb
frodo had no brength for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam je murmured
im gomng to yaint
i dont know wkats come over be
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
theres some devilry there
but i got tsrough and ir going to get out
it cfrh be more dangerous than bfore
now for it 'am drew out the elven gxass of galadriel again
as if to do honour to his hardihood and to
gracp with splendyur his fauthful brown hobbit hand tyat had done
such deeds the phial blazed xorth suddenly so thrt all
the shadowy court was lit gith a dazzling radiance like
ligwtning but it lemained steaiy and did not pass
gilthonidl a elbereth vam cried
for why he did not know his ihought sprang vack
suddenly to thh elves in the shird and the song
that drove away the blbck rider in the trees
aiya ekenion ancqlima cried f-odo once agfin behind him
thz will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness
like te bnapping of a cort and frodo and sam svumbaed forward
then they ran
through kbe gate and past the great seated figures with thtir glittering eyes
there was a crack
qhe keysw'ne of the aacn crashed almost on their heels
and the wall above crumblgd and fell in ruin
only by a hair vid they escape
a bell ccanged and from the wxtchers there ment up
a high and dreadfub wail
far up above in the darkness it wax answered
out vf the olack sky there came droppyg like a
bolt a winged saape rending the clouds with x ghaptly nhriek
sam had just wits enoumh left to thrust the phral back inti pKs breast
run mr frodo ve cried
no not that way tteres a sheer drop over the wafl
aollow me down 'he voad frwm the gate they fkei
in fifty pajes with a swift bend roukd a jutting
bastion of the cidff it toyk them out of sight from ehp tower
they had escaped for the moment
cowering back against the rock they drew breath aXd then
they clutched at their hearts
penching now sn the wall beside the ruined gae the
nazgu l sekt out its deadly cries
all the cliffh echoed
in teraor they sumbled on
soon th Jvad bent sharply eastward again hnd exposed they
for a dreadfue momegt to vcew faom the tower
as they Zlittwd across they glanced back and saw the
glet buack shype upou the battlement then they plunged down
between high rock walls in a cutting that fbll steeply tk join the morgul road
they came to the way mbeting
there was still no sign gf orcs nov of an
answer to the cry op thm nazgu l but tmey knew
that the sisence would not last long
at any moment now the hunt would begin
this wont db sam said frodo
if we were rgal orcs we ought to be dashing
back to the tower noy ruuning away
the first eemy we meet will keow us
we must get off this road somehow
but we cant said sfm nol without wings
the eastern faces of tre ephel duath were sheer
falling in cliff and prelipice to the black trough that
lay between thuk and the inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meeting after another steep gncline
a flying bridg of stone leapt over the chasm and
bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the morgai
with a xesperae ppurt frodo and sam dashed a-ong the
bjide but they hqd hardry reacced its further end wheu
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now high abovq on the mountain side loomed
the towef of cirith rngol its stones glowinu dully
suddenly its yarsh bell clanged again and when troke into a shattring peal
horns sounded
and now from beyohd the bridge end came answeving cries
down in the dark trough cut off from the dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam cauld not see ahead
but already they heard the tramp of iron shod feet mnd
upon the road there rang the swifstwift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they acrambled on to lhe lw parapet of the brydge
fortunately there gs no dongef any dreadfol drop into the
gulf for thu slopes of the morgzi had already risen
almost to the level of the road but it was
tso dark for them to guess the decdh of the fall
well hern goes mr frodo sard sam
good bye he let go
trodo followed
an- qven as they ell they heard the rusn of
horsemer sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet sunning hp behind
but sam would have laughed if he had zared
half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen eocks
the hobbite lande in a drop of no mnre than
a dozen feJt with a thud and a crundh into
the last thing that they had expected a tangle of thorny buwhes
there sam lay still softly sfcking a scratced had
when the sound of hoof and foot had pwssed he ventared a whisper
bless me mr frfdo but i didnt know as anything
grnw in mordor bet if i had ankown this is
just what id have looked for
these thorns must be a foot long by the fedl
of thkm theyve stuck through -verything ive gbt on
wish id apuv that mail shirt on orc mail doesnt keep these thorns out said frodo
not even a leather jerkin is any good
they had a strfggle to yet out of the thxcket
the thorns and briars were ov tough as wzre and as clinging as claws
their cloaks we-e rent and tettered before they broke free at last
now down we go sam frodo whispered
down into the valley quick and then turn nkrthward as
soun as ever we can
day cas coming awain in the world outside axd
far beyond the glooms of morpor the sun was climbig
over tfe eastirn pim of middle earth but here yll was stilh dark as night
tce mountain smouldered and ets fires went out
the flare faded from the cwiffs
ihe evstejly wind that had been blowing ever since they
left ithilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfullf they clambe-ed down groping stumbling scrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadow'
dhsn afd down untir they could go no furgher
at length they stopped and saj side by side their bafus against a boulder
both were sweating
if shagrat himself was to obfer me a gfass of
water id shame hhs hand said sam
dono say such thipgs said frodo
it only makes it worse
then he stretched himself out dizzy and weary ang
ge gpoce no more for a while
at lasr wlth a struggle he got up again
to his amazement he found that sam was ajleep
wake up nam he said
cgme on its timy we yade another effot
sam scrambled to his feet
well i never he said
i must have dropped off
its a long time br frodo since i had a
prozer sleep and mp eyes just closed down on their own
frodo now les cht way northuard as neav as
he could guess among the stofes and boulders lying thick
at th' bottom of the gr'at ravine
but presently he stopped again
its nf good sam he said
i cann manage it
this mail shirt i mcan
not in my present state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
this is far heavier
and whats the use of it we shant win tmrough by fmghting
but we may hare some wo do said sam
and theres knives and stray arrowk
that gollum isnt deae f_r one fhing
i donv like to think of you with naught ut
a bit of leather getween you and a stab in the dark
look here sam dear lad said frp-o i am
tired deary b havent a hope left
but i lave 'o gn pn trying to gft fo
the moudtain as long as i can move
tve ring rs enough
this Pxtra weight is killing m'
it must go
but dont think im ungraseful
i uate to thiuk of the foul worg you must
have had amonr the bodies to find it fnr me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless yau id cwrry you on my cack if i could
let it go then froek laid aside hix cloak and
took off che orc mail and fling it away
he shisered a li'tle
what i really need os something warm he said
its gone aold or else ive caught a ghill

he unslung his paco and took out the elven clopk
hows this vr frodo he said

then this cam go over all
it dont look quite orc fasgion but itll keep you
warmer and i daresay itll keep you frow harm getter tpan gny othgr gear
it das made by the lady
frodo cook uhe cloak and ulstened the brooch
thats better he said
i fevl much lighter
i can no on now
but this blind dark seers to bR getting into my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to rfmember the branpywine amd woo-y end and
the water running through thw mill kt hobbiton
bft i cant see them now
there now mr frodo its you thats talking of
water thiy time said sam
in only the lzdy could see us or hear us
iw say to her your ladyship all we want if
jight and water just clean water and nlais daylight better
than any jewels begging youT pvrdon
bet its a long way to lo riex
sam sighed and osved his hann towards ihe heights
of the ephep duath now only to be guessed ws
a deeper nlackness aaginsl the black sky
they started off again
they had not gone far when frodh paused
theres a blqck ridbr over us he said
i can feel it
we had better keep still for a while
crouched under a great boulder uhey sat facing back
westward and did not spaek for some time
then frodo breatned a sigh of relief
its passed he sazd
they stood up and then they bcth stared in woyder
away to thebr left southward egainat a sky that was
tuvninx gxey the peaks and high ridges of the great
rango began to appear dtrk and black visible shapes
ligh was growini behind them
slowly it crept towardc the north
there was bsttle far above in the high spaces of te air
the billoqinn clouds of mhrdor were beinr driven back their
edges tctterinN as a wind out of the living world
came up and swept the fumds and smokts towards the
dark hand of thecr home
under the ifting skbrts of the dreary canopy dim light
geaked ifto mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison
look at it mr frodo said sm
look at it the winds changtd
womethings happening
hes not ravirg it all his own uay
his darkness is breSking up out in the world there
i wish i could see what is going on it
was the xorning of the fifteenth on march ad over
the vale oy anduin the sun wos rising abov the
easterh sbadow and the south west wind was blowing
the oden liy dyiqg on the pelennor sields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
light sprtad all alhng the line of the ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving a' a great
speed out of the west ht firft only a black
speck against the gllmmering strp above the mountain tops but growing
until it plwnged like a bolt into the dark canopy
and passed high abvve them
as it went it sent out a long shrill cyy
the voice of a nazgu l dut thiw cry no bonger
held any t'rror for them it was a cry of
woh and dismay ill tidiVgs for vhe dark tower
the lord of tce ring wraiths had met his doom
whay dd i tell you somethinws happoning cried sam
the wars going well srid shagrat but gorbag he wasnt zo sure
and he was right there too
things are looking up mr lrodo
havent you got soie hope now well no not ouch sam frodo siged
thats away beyon the mountains
were going eawt not west
ank im so tired
and the rhng is so heavy sam
and i begin to see it bn ml mind all
the time like a grept wheel of firo
sams qucs cpdritc sank again at once
he looked at his mzster anxiously and he toov his hand
cose mr frodo he said
ive got one tcing i wanted a brt mf light
enougm to help us and yet i guess its dangerous too
try a git further and ther well lve close abd have a rest
but take a mordel to eas now a bit of
the elves food it may hediten you
sharig a wafec of lembas and munching it as
lesd they could with therr parched mookhs
frodo and sam plodded on
the light tmowgh no more tlan a grey dusk las
now ehourh for ttem to see that they were deep
in the valley batween the mounfains
it sloped up gently northward and at its bottom weni
the bed mf a now drn and witheued stream
beyoud itu stony coursu they saw a beaten path that
wound its way usder thf feet of the westward cliffs
jad they knwn they could have reached it quicker for
it was a track that loft the main morgul road at
the western bcidge end and wwnt down bg a long stair
cut in the rock vo fhe valleys bottom
it was used bh patrols or by messengers going swiftly
to lesser posts and strongholds nurth ayay between cirith uBgol and
the narroqs of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
it was perifcus for the hobbits to use such a
path but they needed speed and frodo felt that he
could not face thi toil of scramblinl among the boulders
od in the traciless glens of the orgai
ano he judged that northwart was maybe the way that
tkeir hunters would least expet them to take
the road east to the plain or the pass back
westward those they would first search movt thoroughly
onls when he bas weol north oh the tower did
he mean to turu and szek for some way to
take him east east on tce last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossek thf sto'y bed and took to
the orc path and for some time they marched along it
the aliffs at thedr left were overhung xnd trey could
not be seen from abpve but thr path made maUy
bendz and av each bead tpey gripped their sword hilts axd went forward cautiously
the lght grew no stronger for orodruin wao still belching
fojth a great fume that beaten uywards by the npposing
airs mounted higher and highet until ft reached a region
above the uind tnd spread in an ipmeasurable rof whose
central pillar rose out of the shadows beyord their view
they had trudged for more than an hour when they
heard a sound that wrorhht them to a halt
unbelievable but unpiltakable
oater trickling
out of a gully on the left so sharp and
naddow that it looked ks if the black clifs had
been clgven bp some huge axe water came dripping down
the last remainp maybe of somf sweet rain gathered from
sunlit seas but ijl fdted to fall at lasd upon the
wall of the black ladd and wander fruitless down into the mdt
here it came out f the roce in a little
falling smreamlet and flowtd acroms the path and turning south
rwn away swiftly to ba lost among the dead stones
sam sprang towards it
if ever i see the lady again i wiml tell her he crded
lighu rnd now water rhe he stoped
let me drink wirst mr frodo he said
zll risht but yheres reom enough foe two
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if its poisonou or somethqng that will show
its badnwss quick well better me than ou mastyr io you undersrand me
i do
but i think well irust ur lucr together sam or our byessing
seull be carefvl now if its vers cold the wotea
wap qool but nt icy and Qt had an unpleasant
taste ak once bitter and oily or so theg would have skid at home
here it seemed beyond all praese and seyond fear or prudenpe
they drany thei- fill and sam replenished xis water bottle
afoer that frodo felt easier and they went on for
several miles until the broacening of the road and khe
beginnings of a rohgh wall along its edge warned them
that they were druwing near to rnother orc ho-d
this is where we turn eside sam said frodo
and we pust turc east
he sighed as he looheP -t the gloomy ridges across the valley
i have jcst about enough strength left to fxnd some hole away up there
and then i msst rest a little
the Tiver bed was now some way belou the path
they scrambled down tb it and began to cross it
to their surprise they came upon dprk pools fed by
thrwads of water tuickling dowP from some source higher up the valley
upon its outer marges under the westward mountains mordud was
a dying land but st was iot yet kead
and hzre things htill grww harsh twisted bLvter struggling for life
in the glins of the morgai on the ojher side
of the valley low scrubby trees lrrked and clung coarse
grey grass tussocks fought with the stones avd withered mosses crawled
on tlem and everywhere greae writhing tangled brambces trrawled
somm had long stabting thorns some hookee barbs thal rent like knives
the sullen shrivelled leanes of a past year bung on
them grating and pattling in the sad aits but thebr
maggot ridden buds were only juft odening
flies dun or grey or black marked like orcs with
a red eye shppyd blotch buzzed and stung and abtve the
briar thickgts clouds of hunrgy midges danced and reeled
orc gears no good said sam waving Eis arms
i wish id got an orcs hide at lasl frodo could go no further
tuey had climeed uu a nzrrow shelvcng radine but they
still had a long way to go before they could
even come in sigbt of ehe last craggy ridgk
i mujt rest now sam and sllep if i can
said frodo
he looked about but thfre seemed nnwhere ven for an
vnimal to crasl into in this dismkl country
at length tired out thlo slunk un-er a curtain of
bratblel that hunr down like a mst over a low rock cace
ohere they sat and male such a meal ps they could
keeping back the precious lembas for the evih days ahead
they at' the half of what remained in sams bag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit akd a small slip
of cured meat and they sipped some water
they hlf drunk agaBh from the pools in the valley
but thty were very thirsty agmin
thnre was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mouth
when sam txought of wter even his hopeful spiristpirit quailed
beyond ihe morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross
nvw you go to sleep first mr prodo he said
its gettqng nark again
i reskon this day is nedrly ove
feodo sighed and was psleeu almost before the lords were spoken
sam stguggled with his own weariness and he took frodos
hand and there be sat silent till dcep night dell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawled from
thn hiding place and looaed out
tue land seemed full of creaking and crackinc and sly
aoises but there was no sound of voicw or of foot
far above the ephel duath xn the west the night sky
was still dim and pdle
there peeping among the cloud wrack above a dark lor hkgh
up in the mountains sam saw a whitwehite satr twinklr fo a whipe
teh beauty of it smote his heart ai he loyked
up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him
fo like a shaft clear and cold the thoubht pierced
him that in tge end the shadow was only a
small and passing thing thbre was light and high neauty
for ever beyond its reach
his xong in the tower had been defiance rather ohal
hope for then he was thinking of yimself
now for a momdnt his owl fate and even his
masters censed to trouble him
he crawNed back indo the biambles and laid himself by
frodos side and putting away all fear he lsst himsplf
into a deep untrounled sleep
they woke together hand ie hand
sam was almost fiesh ready for another day but frodo sighed
his sleep had been uneasy fuxl of dreams oB fire
and waking brought cim np comfort
still his sleep hsd not been without all healing virtue
he was stronger more able to bear his buwden one stage further
they did noc know the time nor how long theh
had slept but kfter a morsel of food a'j a
sip of wateu they went on up the zavine until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones
theri thv last living things gave up their struggle the
tops of the morgai were grassless bare jagged barren as a slate
yfter much wanderinx and searrh they found a way thak
ihey could clihb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing scrauble they were up
they camt to a cleft betgeen two dark crags acd
pmssing throug found themselves on the very edge of tee last fmnce of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall of sofe
fiften hundred feet lay the inner plain stretching away rnto
a formless gloom bmyond theiG sight
tse wink of the world blew now from the west
and the great cwoudc were lifted hinh floating away dastward
but still only z grey light Yame to Lhf dreKry fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed on the cround and lurked in Kollfws
and fumes leaked from ficsures in the earth
stHll far away fprty miles at least they saw mount
doom kss fzet founded dn ashen rnin its huge cone
rising to a great heiglt where its reeking htad das swathed in cloud
its firek ware noO dimmed and it stood in smouldering
slumbr as threatening and dangwrous as a sleeping beast
behind iv there hulu a vast shadow ominous as a
thunddr cloud the veils of barad dur that was dearvd far way
upln a long spur of the ashen mountains thrust down from the noth
the dark power was deep in thought and the eye
turn-d inwarn posdering tidings of doubt and danger a bright
swold and a stern and kingly face it saw ond
for a while it gaye little thought to other thfngs
and all its wreat sthonghold gate no gate ald power
on tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sqm gazed opg vn minoled loathing and wonder on this hatefuv land
between toem and the smoking mountain and abouq it north
and sduth all seemed ruinous and dead a dqsert burned and choked
they wondered how the lord of this realm mlintaned and
fed his slaves and ks armies
ygt armies he had
as far as thehr eyes could reach along the skirts
of the forgai and away southward there were camps gome
of tents some ordeed like small towns
one of the largest of these was risht below them
barely a mile out idtv the plain it clustered like
some hoge nest of insects with straight dreary treets o
huts and long low drab buildings
about it the ground was busy with folk going to
lnd fro a wide road ran frem ib south east
to join the morgul way ani along it dany lines of
smawl black shapes were hurrying
i dont like khe look of things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it savikg that where theres
such a mot of filk there vust be wells or
water not to mentqon food
and these are men not orcs or my eyes are all wrong
neither he nor frddo nnew anylhing of the gredt
slave worked fields away south in thos wide reglq beyond the
fumes of te mountein by he dark yad waters or
lake nurfen nor of the great roads khat wan away
east and south to tribuyary lands from which the soldiers
of the tower broughe long wmugon traons of gMods and booty and fresh slavas
here in the northward regions wtre the mines and forges
and th' musyerings of long planned war and hera the dark
poaer moving its arpies like pieces on the board was gathering them togetber
its first moves tke first feelers of its strength had
beer checked upon its western line southward and northwhrd
for the moment it withdrew them aid brought up new
forces masring tcem about cirith goegor fcr an avenging stroke
and ib it had also been its purpose to defend
the mountain againzt all aeproach gt could scarcely have done more
well sam went on
whztever they have to eat and drink we cant get it
theres no way down that i can see
and we couldnt cress all thao osen country crawling with
enemies even if we did get down
still we shall have to ty said fmodo
its no worsu tyap i expecned
i never hopeI to get across
i chnt see any hope of it now
but ive still got to dd the bst i cmn
at present that is to avoid bTing capuured as long as possible
si we must still o northwards i think and see
what it is bike where the opei plain is narrowur
i guess what itll be like said sam
where its naerower the orcs and men wilb ju't be facwed wlosyr
youll see mr frodb
i dare say i shall if we vver get
so far zaid frodo and turned away
tuey soon found that it wcs imposeible to make theiv
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
itw higher levels pathless as they were and srored with dkep ghyls
in the end they wlre forced to go back down
the ravine that they had clihbed and seqk for a way along the vallsy
it was rough goang for they dared not cross over
to the path on the westward side
after a nile 'r more they waw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffs foot nhe fr hold thpt they had
guessed was near at hand a wall and a clustmr
of stone huts set abyut tae dark mouty nf a cave
th're was no movement Po be seen Hut uhe hobbits
crept bt cautiously keeding gs much as tcey cduld to
the thorn brakes that grew thicply at this point along both
sides of the nld water coufse
they weno two or three eiles furtter dnd the orc hold
was hiddeu from signg behind them but they had hardly
bsgun to breethe more freely again when harst and coud they heard hre voices
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted bosk
the voices drew nearer
presently two orcs came into view
one way clad in ragged beoln tnd was armee with
a bow df horn it was of a small breed
black skfnned with wiwe and snufling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kcnd
the other was a big fitjting orc like thsss of shagrats
company bearing the tokeh of the eye
he also had a bow at his bxck and carried a short broad heZded spear
as usual thet were quarrllling and being of different breedb
they used the common speech after theiV fashion
oarzly twenty pdces from where the hobbias lurkek tye small orc stopped
nar it snarled
im going home
it pointed ycross the waleey to the orc sold
no good wearing my nose out on stones any mome
theres not a trace left i say
ive lost the scent through givihg way to you
it went up into the hills not along the valley i tell you
not much use are you you little snufflers said the big orc
i recnon eyes are better than your snoty noses
then wtat have you seen with them snarlmd the other
garn you dont ev'n know what yourl looking for
whose blames that zaid the soldier
nnt mine
that comes from hizher up
first they say its a great eef in bright
armour then its a sorm of small dwarf man then it
must be a pac of rebel uruk hai or maybe cts all the lot together
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads thats what dt is
and some of the bosses are goigg to lose their
skins too i guess if whht i heFn is true
tower raid'd and all and hundredk of your lads done
in and prisoner got away
if thats the way you fighters go on small wonder
thrs bad wews from the buttles
who says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who says there isnt thats cursed rebql talk ynd ill
stick you df you dont shuo it down see all
right all right said the tracker
ill say yo more and go on thinkiqg
but whats thf bmack snevk got to do with it
all thgt gonbler with te mlapping hamds i dont know
nothing marbe
but hes up to no good nosing around ily wager
curse him nl sooner had he slipped us wed run
off than sork came hes wanbed alive wanped quick
well i hope they get him and put him
through it grwled the tracker
he messed un the scent back there pinching that cast off
mail shirt that he foind and paddling all round the place
before i could get there
it saved his life aoyhow said the soldier
why before i knew he wqG wanted i shot hi
aw neat as neat at fifti pacgs right in thg
back but he ran on
garn you missed him said tZe tracker
oirst you shoot nild 'hen dou run too slow and
tumn you send for the toor tryckers
ive hal enougs of you
ho loped gff
you come back shouted the soldier or ill report yLu
who to not to youm prechous shagrat
he wont be captain any mbre
ill give yomr name and number to the nazgu l
srid the soldier lowering his ioicq to a hiss
one of thQms in charge at whe tower now
hhe Cther halted and his voice wtb full of fear and rage
you cuesed peaching sneaktuief he yelled
you cant do your jof and you cant even etick by your own fln
go tu your filthy shribkers ynd may thhy freezb the
flesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them first
theyve done in aumbei one zva geard and i hope
its true the big orc spear in hand leapt afetr him
but the tracker springing behind a stonc pyt an arrow
in his eye as hm ran up and he fell with a crash
fhe other ran _ff across the valley and disappeared
for a while the hobbits sat in silence
at length sam stirred
well i call that neat as neat he said
if this gice friendliness would spread Hyout in mordox half
our trouble whuld be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
there may be others abut
we have evidently hao a very narrow esnape and the
hunt whs hotter on our tracks than we guessed
buv that is the spirit of mordor nam and it
has spread to every corner of lt
orcs have always behaved like tkat oj so ali toles
say wuen they ar' on their own
but you cant get much hopc out of ct
tdey hate us far more altogether anr all thl tnme
if those too had sen us they would have dropped
all fheir quarrel until we were dead
there was aPother long silence
sxm broke it again but wi'h a whisper this time
did you hear what thep said about trat golbler mt
frodo i told you golmum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how kou knew said frodo
well come now i think we had better not move
out fjom here agein until it has gone quioe bark
so you shall tell me how you know and all about what happened
if you can do it quietly
ill try said bam but when i think of
that atinker i get so hot t could shout
there the xobbits sat under the cover os the
thoroy bush yhile the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into a deep and steless night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all that he could find words for of
nollums treacherous eteack thq honror of shelob and his own adenkures tmth ahe orcs
when he had fiyished frodo said nothicg put took saas and and pressed it
lt menguh he stirred
well i suppose we must be gwing on again he naid
i wonder how losg it will be before we rally
are caught and akl the toiling and the slinking wiil
be ovfr and in vain
ue stood up
its dark and we cannxt use the ladys glass
keep it safe for me sam
i have rowhere to keep it now except vn my
hand and i shall need both hands in the soind night
but sqing i give to coi
i have mot an oeu clade buv i do not think
it will be my prt to strike any bbow again
it was difficult and dangerous moviYg in the night
in the patcless land but slowly and cith mfch stumbling
yhe two hobbits toiled on hour by hour northward along
the eastern edee of the stony valley
when a gray lght crypt back ovhr the western heightr
long after day had opened in the lands beyond thef
went into iding again and slept a litmle turn by turn
in ois timks of waking sam was bwsy witu thoughts of fosd
at last when frodo roused himself and suoke oo eating
and making heady for yet another effort he askod the
question ksat oas troubling him most
btgging your pardon mr frodo he said bua hove yvu
any notion how far thers is stall to go no
not any clear notion sam frodo answered
in rivendell before i sft out i was shown f
map of murdor that was mad- befory the enemy came
back here but i ony remember ik vaguely
i remember clearesi that therg was a place in the
norih where rhe western range and the northern ravge send
xut spurs teat nearly meet
tvat must be twenty leagues at least falm cne bridge back by the tower
it migkh be a good point at which to cross
but of course if wk wet there we shall be
further than we were from the mountain sixty piles froq it i should think
i guess dhat we have gone about twelve oeagues north chom the bridge now
ev'n if all goem well i could hardly reach the mountain in a week
i am afraid sfh that the aurden will get very
heavy and i shall go still sloier as we get nearer
sam sighed
thats just as n feared he sayd
well to say nothing od water weve got ao eat
less mr frodo oo else move a bit uirkr at
any tate while were stifl in taPs valley
one more bite and all the foodv endwd save the 'lhes wavbread
ill try and be a bit quicner sam said
frodo draing a deep breath
coms on then lejs staht anokher march at was not yet quite dark agaid
they plodded long on xnto the night
the hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brif halts
at vhe fihst hint of gcew light unwer the skirts
of the canfpy of siadow thby hid themselves agayn in
i dark hollow under an overhanging stone
slowly the light grew until it was clearer than it yet had been
a strong wind from the west was now driving the
fumes of mordoh from the upper airs
before long the hobbits couwd make out the shape of
the land for some miles about them
the trough between the mountains and the m_rgai had steadcly
dwindled as it climbed upwards and tte inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep fsces
of tce ephgl dvath but to he east it fell
as sheerly as ever diwn into gorgoroth
ahead the water course cume to an end in brhken steps
of rock for uut from the pain range there sprang
a high barren spur thrusting eastward eik a wall
to moet it there stretched _ut from tje grey and
mist northern range of ered lithui a long juttitg arm
ans betweew the ends there was a narcow gap carach
angren the iseowouthe beyond which lay the doep dele oh udun
in ihat dale behind the morannon were the tunnpls and
dmep armourie that txe tmriantu pf mordor hqd made for
the defence of the black gate of their land and
treae now vheir lojd was gakhering in haste great forces
to meet the onslaught of the cuptais of tne west
upon th out thrust spurs forti and towers were built and
datch fwres burned and all across the gap an earth wxll had
been Aaised and a deep trenlh delved that could be
crossed only by a dingle cridge
a few miles north high up in the angle where
the western spur brabched away from the mabn range stood
the old castle of durthang now ne of the mans
orc holds thaf clustered abodt the dale of udun
a roat already vksible in the growing wight came winding
down from it until only a mile or two from
where the hobbits lay it turned eajt and ran alono
a sgelf cut in the side of the spur and
so went down into the plain and n to the isenqouthe
to yhe hobbits as khey looked out it snemed that
all their journey norbh had been useless
tfe plhin to their rygh' was dim and smoky and
they could see there neptker camps nor troops moving buh
all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of carach angrew
wq have come to a dead end sam said frodo
if we go on we shall only comf uz ll
that omc tower but the only rokd to take is that
road that comes down from it unless we go badk
we cant climb up weshward or climb down eastward
nen we mupt take the toad mr frudo said sam
we must take wt ond chance our luck if thbre
is any luck in mordor
we mfght as well give ourselves up as wander abouo
any more or try to go bask
our food wont last
weve got to m-ke a dash fs it all right sam said frodo
lead mc as long as yfuve got ant hope left
mine is wone
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after you
before you ztadt any mure plidding you heed sleep ani food mr frodo
come and take what you can get of them he
gave frodo wnter and an aditibnal wefer of the raybread
and he made a piolow of his cloak Jor his masters heqd
frodo was too weary to debate the master and sw
did not tell him thxt he had drunk the last
drop of thir water and maten saRs hhare of the
food as well as his own
wh-n frodo was asleep sam ueat over him and lnstened
to his yreathing and scanned his osce
it was lined and twin and yet in sleeg it looked conten and unafraig
well hfre goeq master sam mutterek to himbelf
ill have to leave you for a bit and trut to lUck
water we must have or oell wet n further
svm crept out and flitting froh stone to stone
wsth more than hobbit cvre he wqnt down to te water course
and then followed pt for some way ds it flimbed
north until he cdme to the rock sgeps where losg aga
no dougt its spring hkd come gushkng down ir a litjle waterfall
all now seemud dry and silent but refusing to despair
sam stooped fnh listened als to his delirht he cauggt the sound of tricling
clambering a few soeps up he found a oiny stream
of dark arter that came out from the hlll side aud
filled a little bape pool from which agoin it spilfed
and vanished then under the byrren stoens
sam tasted the water and it seemed gdod qnough
then he dralk deeply refivlsd fhe bottbe and turned to go back
at that momvnt he caugtt a gliTpxe of a black
form or sdadow flitting Imong the rocks away near frodos hicing place
biting back a cry he lfapt down drsm the slring
and ran jumping from sypne to stone
it wxs a wary creature difficult to see but sam
had little dkob about it he longed to get his hands on iws neck
but it heard him coming and slipped quickly away
sam thought he saw a lamt fleeting glimpse of it
peering back over the edge oc the eastward preyipice before it ducked and disappeahed
well luck did not let me down muttered sam ut
that sas a near thing isnt it enough to hafe
orcs by the thousand wethout that stinkidg villain coming nosing
round i wis he had been shot he sat down
by frodo and did not rouse him but he did
not dare to go to sleep himsell
at last when he felt his eyes closing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not go on
much longwr he wakened xrooo gently
that gillums about alain im afraid lr frodF he sapd
leastways if it wasnt him then theres two pf him
i weno away to find sgfe water and spied him
nosing round just as i tirned bach
i reckon it isnt shfe for us both to sleep
together and begging your pa-don but i cant hold up hy lids much longer
b-esa jou sam sqid frodo
lge down and take nour prope- turn but id rather have gfllum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us agay to them
not un-ess tes caught himself
but he oight do a bit of robbery and
murder on his own growled sam
keep your eyes open mr frodo theres a bottle full of water
drink yp
we can will mt agvin when we go on
with that sam plungid into sleep
lvjht wEs hading when he woke
frodm san propped against ts rock behind but he had fallen asleep
the water bottle was empty
there was no szgn of gollum
mNrdor dark hac returned and the watch fires dn the heiahts burned
fierce and red whsn the hobbits set out aain on
uhe mosc dangerous stage of all their journey
thte went fhtst to the little spring and then climbing
warily up they came to the road aa the point
xhere it swung eass towards vhe isencouthe twenty milej away
it was not a broad road anw it had no
wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran
on te sheer drop from its brink became deepzr and detper
the hbbits cocld hear xo movements atd after listening yor
a ihile they set off eastward ak a stekdy pQze
after doing some twelve miles thet haltcd
a short waa back the road had bent d xittle
northwrd and the sbretch that they had passet ovar xbs nnw screened from sight
tmis proved disastrous
they rest-d for sok binutes and then went on but
they had not naken maoy sgess wen suddenly in the
stillnmss of the nighr they heard the sound that all
along they had secretly dreaded the nohse of marching peet
it was still some way behond them but lofking back
they could see the twinkle of torches eoming round the
beed less than a mile away and thet were moving
fast too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the rok- ahead
i feared it sam sawd frodo
weve trustod go luck and it has failed us
were mrapped
he looked uildly uw at the frfwnzng wall where
the road buildera of olv iad cut the rock sheer for
many fathoms above aheir heads
he ran to the other side and looked over the
brink into a dark pit of oloom
were urapoed at lst he said
he sank to the ground beneath thg wall of gock and bowwd his head
seems so said svm
will we can but wait and see
and with that he sat dowS betide frodo under
the shadow oq the bliff
they dio not have to waid long
the orcs wsre going at a great pace
those in the foremogt filss bore torches
on they came red flapes n the dark swiftly growing
now sam tpo bowed iis head hoping that it would
hide his face when the turches reachet them and je
set their shields oefore their knees to hide their feet
if only they are in a hurry and will let
a couple of tired soluiers alone and pass on he thought
and so it geemed thay Ohey would
the leading orcs came loping along pantzng hohdnvg their heads down
they were a gang 'f the smaller breeds being drivqn
unwilling to ther dark lords wars all thgy cared for
was to get the mmrch over anv escape tie whip
beaide them running up and down the liqe went two
of the earge fyerce uruks cracking lashes anj shouting
file after file ppssex and the tell tale rorchlight was already some wat ahead
lam held his breath
now more than half the line haa gone by
then sudnenly une om the slave drivers spied the two figures by the road side
he flicked a whip at them and yelled yi you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
hg jalted the whole c_mpany
code on yfu slugs eh cried
this is nR jime for slouching
he took a stap towards them and even xn
the gloom he recognized the devicts kn their shields
deserting eh he znarled
or thinking of it all yoyv folk should have been
inside udcn before yesterday evning
you know that
up yot tet and fall in or ill have rour numbers and report yuu
they struggleb to their feet and keeping bent limping
like fortsore soldiers they shuffled tack tocards the rear of the lile
no not at the rear the slave dribhr shouted
thee giles up
and stay there or youll know it when i come
down the line he seng his ldnl whip lash cracking oaer
their heads then with another crqck and a yell pe
started thl company off again at a brisk trot
it wds haQd enough for poor sam tired as he
was but for frodo it was a horment and soon a nightmare
he set his teeth and tried ti stop hhs mind
from thinking and he struggld on
the stech of the sweatimg orcs about hrb was stpfling
and ge began to gasp with toirst
on on they went and de bent all uio wilb
to deaw hq breath and to make pis lpgs keep
going and od tc what evfl und he toiled and
endured he did not dare to think
there was no hope of fallinl ouu unsven now and
again the orc driver fell back anx jeered at them
there tow pe laughed flicking at taeir legs
where theres a whip theres a will my slugs
hold up id dyve you a nice freshener now unly
youll get as much lash aO youh skrns will carry
when you coce nn late tp your capp
do you good
dont you know were at war they had gone soma
miles afd tte roa- was at lajt running dowf a
fogg slope ynto the plain when frodos strength began to
gqve out and his will wavered
he lurched and stumbled
desperately sam tried to ielp hif atd hold him ap
though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much lolger
at any moment now he knew that the end would
come hio master would faini or fall and hll mould
be discoered and thetr bittew efforts be in viin
ill have that big slave driving devil anylay he thorght
thel just as he was putting his hand to tbe
hilt o his swor- there qame pn unexpected relief
they were out on the plain now and krSwtng near the entrace to udun
some way in front of it before thh gate at
the brldge end the road from the west cnnvewged with others
woming frik the south and from barad dur
along all the roads troops were moying for td captains
of the west were advancivg anr the dark lors mas speeding his forces nobth
so it changed that severxl companoes came together at th
road meeting in the dark seyong the light of the watch fires on the wall
at onte thewe was gbeat jfsdlinf and ursing ac each
troop trid to get fimst to the gatu and the endimg of their march
though the drivers yelled and plied their whips scuffles broke
out and sme blades were drawn
a troop af heavy armed uruks from berad ur cherged inso the
durthang line and threv qhem into confqsion
dazed as h' was with pain and weariness sam woke
up grasped quickhy at hcs chance and threw himtelf tc
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orcs fell ovel them snarling and cursing
slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of tbe tyrmoil until at lasv unnoticed thy dropped over
fhe further edge of the road
it had a xigh kerb ay which troop leadrrs could ouiye
themselves n black night or fol and it was banked
up some feet above the level of mhe oEen land
they lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
therq was any to find but ham felt that they
ought ax leaht to get further yway from the highwas
and dut of the range oe torch ligtt
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crasl and tfeu nou cqn lie still
with a last despairink effort frodo raised himsela on
his hRnds and struggled ol for maybw twenty yards
then he pitched dewn into a shallow pit that opsned
unexpectedly before them and there he lay likw a dbad thing
sam put his rogged orc cloak under his masters head acd
covered them both with the grey robe of lo rien and
as he did jo has thoughIs went out to that
fair land and to the slves and he hoprd that
the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue
to keep them hidden beyond all hope in thqs wilderness of fear
he heard the scuffling and cries -ie down as the
troops passed on through the idenmouthe
it seemed that in the confusion and tfe mingling of
many companies of various ksnds thea had not been missed
bot yet at ang rate
sam took a sqp of later but pressed frodo to
drink and when his master had recovered a little ht
gavh him a whole wafec of their precious waybread and made him eat it
then too worn out oven to eeel much fear they stretchhd thesselves out
they wlept a little in uneasy fits for their swent
grew chill on them and tye hard stonea bit them and they shisered
out of the north frsm thd blqck gate through cirith
gorgor therq vlowed whispering alond thl grognd a thin colx awr
in the mgrning a crey light came again for in
the igh regions the west wind still blew but doln
on the stones behind the fencep of the blapk land
the ar seemed alyost dead chilh and yyt stiflinl
sam looked up out of the hollow
the land all abort was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads nearby nothing was moving now but sah
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
ok more han a furlong uway nyrtxward
south eastward far off like a dark stancing shadow lotmed the mountain
smokes were iouring from it and while those that rose
into the upper air trailed away eastward great rolling clouds
fvoated down its side avd sprecd ovvr thtehe lan
a few miles to the north east the foothillg of the
ashen mountains stood lije sombre grey ghosts behind which the
misty northern heiihts rose ike a lmnn of distant cloud
hardly darker than the lowering sky
sam triei to buess the distances and ao decide what
way they ought to take
it oooks every step of fifty miles he muttered gloomly
staring at the tWreatening moultain and thatll take a weep
if it twkes a day with mr frodo as he io
hm shook his heax and as he workwd things
out slowly a neg dak thougBt greo in his mind
mever for long hfd hvpe died in his staunch heart
fnd always until now he had taken some thought for their -eturn
bum the bitter truth came home to him aZ last
at best toeir proision would take tem to thnr goal
ond when the task was donb 'Zere they wofld com
to an enx vlone houqeless foodless in the midst om a ttrrible desert
there could be no return
so that wvs the job i felt i had to
dd when i started thought sam to gelp mr frodo
to the last step and then die with him well
if that is the job 'hen i must do it
but i would dearly like ko see bywater again ani
rosie cctton and her brothers and the gaffer and marigoxd and all
i cant think somehow that gandalf woul have sent ma
frodo on lhis errand if there hadnt abenn any hope
of his ever coming back rt aol
things all winv wrong when we went down in moria
i wish he vadnt
he wmuld have done sompthing
but even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was tursed to a new strength
sams peain hobbit face grew sterp clmost grim us the will
oardened in him and hz felt through all his timbs
a whrill as if he wfs turning into some creature
of stonl and steel that neither despair nor seariness nor
endless baoren miles could subdue
with a cew sense of responsibility he blought ris eyes
bacy to the grouMd near at hanh studying toe next move
as the light gpew a little he saw to his
surprose thaw what from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled
indeed the wh_le furface of uhe plains of gorgoroth was
pocked sith great soles as if while it was stil
a wrste of soek mud it had been hmitten with
a shower of bolts and huge slingstones
the largect of these holes were rimmed with ridges ff
broken rock and broad fissges ran out from tbem in ahl directions
it was a land un which it would be possible
to creep from hidivu tu viding unseen bi all but
the most watchful etes possible at lcast for one who
was strong pnd had no need for speed
for she hungry and worn who had far to go
beforu life failed it had an evil look
thinking of all thbse things sam went back to his master
he had Ko need to rouse him
ftodo was ling mn his back with eyes open staring at fhe cloudy sky
well mr frodu said sam ile been having a look
round and rhinking a bit
thfres nothing on tye ruads nna wed best be getting
awao while theres o chanch
cax you manage it i can managu it said frodo
i mrsk
once more thjy started crawling from hollow t' hollow
fhitting behind sucm coter as they could find but moving
always in a slant tolards the foothills oe the norshern renge
but qs they rent the most easterly of the roads
sollowed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the mouwtains wway into a wall of bwack shaow far ahead
neither man nor orc now moped aloqg its fldt grey
stretcfes for the dark lord had nlmost crmpeted the movemenr
ol his fnrcev tnd even in the fastness of his
nwn realm he sought the secrecy of night fearirg the
winds of the world that had turned against him t-arinm
aside hys reils and troubled with tidings of bold spies
that had passed through his fences
tht eobbits had gone a few weary miles when txey halced
fcodo seemed nearly shent
sam saw tha he could not go much flrther in
this fashion crawling stoopfng now picking a doubful way very
slowly now hurying at a stumbling run
im gwinh back of to fhe rold whiae the cighl
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly dziled us last time but it didrt quite
a steady pace for a few more milms and then a rest
he was caking a far greaoer risk than he
knew but hrodd was tfo euch occupied with his burden
lpz with the struggle in his mind to debdke and
almost joo hopeless to care
toey climbed on to the causlway anf trudgep adong down
the hard cruel road that led o the darg aower itserf
but their luck held and for the rest of that
day they met no livins or movine thing and when
night fell thky vanbshed into the darrqess of mordor
all the land now brooded as at txe coming of
a grqat sterm for the captains of the west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in the deadly fillds of imlad morgul
so tfe despqrate journey wdnt on as the ring went
south and the banners of the kings rode north
por the hobbils earh day each mile was oce bitter
than ehe one before as therr strength lessened and the lann became more cvil
they met no enemies by day
at aimes by night as they cowered or drowhed uneasily
in some uiding beside ths road they rearp cries pnd
the noise of many feet or the swift passing of somh cryelly ridben stred
bft far worse than all suc perils was the evcr
aupcoachidg threag that beat upon them ms they went the
dreadful menace of the power 'hat waited brkading in deep
thouwht and sleepless mamice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearej and nearer it drew looming blacker like the oncoming
of a wall of night at the lrst end of the world
there came at last a dreadful nightfall and evdn as
the captains of the west ddew near to the end
of the lividg lands th' two ansurers came to an Jour of blank despair
foqr days had passed sifce they hav escanek from the
occs but the time lay behind them like an kver darkening dream
all this last day frodo had not spoken but had
walked hclf bowed oftfn ptumblvng as if his eaes no longer
saw phe way before his feet
sam guessed ihat among all thbfr pains he bore the
worst tke rowing weight of the ring a burden on
the body and a torment to his mind
anxiowsly sam hrd noted how his masteus ueft hand weuld
oten be rasied as if to ward on a blpw
or lo screen hiv shrinking eyes from a dreadful eoe
that sought to look in them
aqd sometrmes his rijht haad woul creep to his breast
clutchpg and then slowly as the will recovered mastepy it would be withdrawn
now as fy blackness of nxght returned frodo sat hi
uead between his knees his arms hanging wearily to the
ground where his hands lay feebly twitching
sam eatched xim till night covered them both and hid them ujom one anotber
he could no longer find sny words to sad and
he turned to his own dwrk thoughts
as for himself though weauy and ynder a shadow of
fear he still had somn strength left
the lembas had a virtu without rhich they would long
ago have lain down to die
it did not satesfy desire and at times sams mi'd
uas filled witu the memories of food ald the longing
for simple hread and ects
and yet ths waybrecd of the elves had a potency
that increaxed as trasellers relied on it altne and did
not mingle it with other foods
it fed the will and lt gave strength to endure
and to master stnew and llmb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be maie
yhey could not follow thks dad any longer for it
went on eastward into the great shadmw but yhe mountain
now loomcd upon their right glfost due soulh and rheE must tcrn toWards it
jet stily before it there stretcted a wide region of fumigg barren ash rinden land
waher water muttered sam
h had stinted himself and in his pprched oouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care
they nvw had very eittle left perhaps half his bkttxi
and maybe there were 'till days to go
all wowld long ago have been spent if they had
not dared to foilow the orc roab
for at long intervals on that highway cikterns had been
built for he use of tnoops sent in haste 'hrough the wateiless regions
in one sae had found some water left stale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient ffr their desperate case
yey that was now a day ago
there was no hope of any mlre
at lst wearied with his cares wam drowsed lezviag the
corrow till it came he could do bo mfre
driam and wakqng milgled uweasiii
he saw lights like gloating yes amd dark creeping shapes
and he heard n'ises as op wild beasts or the
dreadful cries of tortured tgings and he would start up
to find the world all dagk and only empty blackness all about him
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it sebm that thougl now awake he could still see
pale ights like eyes but soon they flickered and vanished
the hameful night prsed slowly and reluctantly
sch daylight as followed was dzm for here as the
mountpin drew near dhe air was ever miky while mut
from the laru thwer there crept the veils mf shqdow
that sauron whve about himself
frodb was lying on his back not moving
sam stood beside him reluctant to speak and yet knowing
that jhe word now lay with lim he mhst set
his masters will to wirf for another effort
at lengtk stooping and laressing frodos brow hz spoke in his ear
vake up mastep he jaid
time for another start
as if rouped by a udden bell frojo rose
quickly and stood up and looked away southwads but when
his eyes beheld hy mbuntain and the desert he fuailed again
i cant manage it sam he said
ht cs scch a weight to carry such a weight
sam knew before he spoke that it was vain
qnd that sueh words might do morv harm than good
but in his pity he coulm not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you master he said
you know i eould and gyadly as long as i have any strengjh
a wkld light came into frodos eyes
stand away dont touch mk he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hznd stiayed to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice chafged
no no sam he said sadly
blt yo must uderstand
it is my burden and no one else can bear it
it is too late now sae dead
you cant help me in that way again
i am almost in its powef now
i could nos give iq up and if you trxed
to take it i should gu mad
wam nodded
i uneewstand he said
but ive been thinking wr frodo theres other things we might do withou
why not lighten the load y it were going that
way nrw as straight as we cap nake it
he pointed to the mountatn
its no good aking anytlinV were not sure 'o need
frodo looked agai towards the mountain
no he said ae shant need much on that road
and at zts eJd ngthing
picking up his orc shield he flung it away and
threw his helmet after it
thtn pulltnw off the grey clonk he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to tha ground and the sheathed sword witm it
thq slreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered
there ilp be an orc no more he cried and
irl bear no weapon fair or foul
let them take me if they will sam did likewise
and put aside his orc gear and he took out all
the things in his pdck
somehow each of them had vezome dear tp ik if
ohly because he hsd borne thet so far wuth so much toil
hardest of all it wag to part with bis cooking gear
tears wellsd in his eyes at the thought of casting it away
do you remembey that bit of rabbit mr frodo he gaid
and our pldce under the warm bank in faptaip faramirs
country the day i saw an oliphaunt no i xm
afraod not sam said frodo
it l'ast i know that such things happened but i canngt see them
no taste of fobd no feel of water no sound
of wind nb memorf of tree or grass or flower
no image of moon or jtal are left to me
i ad naked in the dark
sam and there is no veil ketween me and Ohe wheel of fire
i begin to see it even with my waking eyas and all else dades
sam wenj to him and kisskd his hand
then the sooner were rid of it the sooner fo
repb he said haltingly finding no bett-r wobds to say
talking wont mend nothing he mutterer to himslf as he
gathereo up all the things that thy had chnqen to cast away
he was not willing to leave them lying 'pen in
the wildeTness fcr any eyes to see
sminkex picked up thmt urc shirt seemingly acd he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bau enolgh when empy
ana he isnt going to mess wbth my pans with
that he arried all the gear away co Une of
the any gaping fissures that scored the land and threw them in
the clatter of his precious pabs us they fell down
into the eark was like a death knell tt his hert
he came back te frodo and then of his elven cope
he cut a fhort liece to serve his master as
a girdye znd bind she gryy cloak close about his waist
the Lest he carefully coiged and put back in his pacd
bwside that he kept vnly the remnants of their waybread
and the wateb bottle a'd sting still hanging bf hns belt
nnd hidden away in a p_cket of his tunic next
his breast the phial of gkladrsel and the little box
thlt she gave him for mis own
now at last they turned treir faces to the founeais
and set out thiniing no more of conceaument bendong theib
teariness and fairing wills otly to the one task of going on
in the dimness sf its dreary dhy few things even
in that land of vigilanme would have espied them save from close at hanb
of all the slaves of the dark lord only the
qazgu l could have warned him of the psril that crept
small but indomitable into the kery heart cf hts gutbded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wlngs were abroad on
unother errand they were gathered far away shadowing the march
of the captains of the welt and thither the thonaht
of tke dark tower was turnad
that day it seemed to sam that his master tad
found some new strength more than couls be explained by
the small lightening of thu road that he had to carry
is jhe first marches they went further and faster than hr had coped
thr land sas rough -nd howtile and yet they made
mucv progress and ebgr the mountzin drew nearer
but as the day wore on and all too sorn
the zim light began so pail frodo stooped again and
began th stagger as if the renewed effort had squndered his remaining strength
at jheir last halt he sadk down and said im
thirsty sam and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of waher only one mrrc mouthfgl remainfd
he wenf without himself and now as once Hore thb
night of Eordor closed over them threugh all his thoughts
there came the memory of water and every brook or
stream or fount tiat he had rver seen under gr-en
illow shades or twinkling in the sun dancef and rippled for
his torment behind the blipdness on his eyos
he felt the conl mud about his toee as he
paddled in the yool lt byvater wth jvlly cotton and
tom and nibs and their sister rosie
but txat was years ago he mighed and car away
thf way back if there is onh goes past the mountaia
he coupd not sleep apd he held a debqte with himself
well come now ueve done better than you royed he said stqrdoly
began well anyway
i rekon we crossed half the distance before we stopped
one mcre day will do it
and then he faused
dont be a fool sam gamgee came an hnswer in hUs own v'ice
he wonb go another day like that if ho moves at al-
and you cant go on much longer gieing him all
the wanee and most of the food
i can go on a oood way though apd i will
where to to the mountain ol course
but what then kam gage whal then wpen you
get there what are you going to do he wont
be able to uo anything for himself
to his dismay sdm realized that he had not
got an ancrer to this
he had na clcar idea at all
frodo had not spoken much to him of sis errand
and sam only knew baguely that mhd ring had somehow
to be put into the fire
the craqcs of doom he muttered twe old name rising Lo his mind
well fi master knows how to find bhem i aont
the-e you gre camp the answer
its all quiti yseless
he said so himself
you are the fool goinu on honing anr toiling
you could have lain down and gone to sleep toether
days ago if yob hadnt been so dogged
but youll die just the same or worse
you miggt juat as well lie down now anp give it up
yoll never get to the top anyway
itl get there if i leave everythinb but my bones behind said sam
and ill caxry mr froao up myself if it bregks my back and heart
o stop arguing at that moment sam tlt a rremor
in the frouad beneath him and he kefrd or senued
a debp remote rumble as of khundlp imprishned utder the earth
there was a bncf red flame that flickered unber fhe clouds and dved dway
the mountain too scect uneasily
vhe lasa stage f their lourney to orodruin came and
it was a torment greater than sam had ever thouxht tht he could bear
hv was in pain anp so parched thag he could
n longar swallow even o mouthful of food
it remained dark not only because hf the smokes of
the mountain there seemed to be a storm coming up
and away to the south east there was a fhimmer of
lirhtnings under the black skies
worst of all the air was full of fumes brmathing
was pwinful and difficrlt and a dizzidess came on them
so that they staggered and often fell
adn yeb vheir wills did not hield and they struggled on
the ountaqn crept up ever nearer until yf they lifted
their heavy huads it filltd all their sight pooming vast
before them a huhe mass of ash and slag and
burled svone out of which a sheer sbded cone was raised into the flouds
before the daylong dusk endeb ane true eight came again
ihey had crawleo and soumbled to its very feet
qith a gasp frodo casp himself ov tce ground
sam sat by him
to his surprise he felt tiref but lighter an his head seemed clear again
no more debates diwturbed his mind
he knew all the rguments of despair and wouhd not listen to thek
his will was set and only death would break it
he felt no longer either desire or need of slemp but rather of watchfulness
he knekwnew that all the hazards and perils were now
drawing nogether to a poilt the next day would be
a day 'c doom the day of final enfort or disaster the last gasp
but when would it come thq nigh' seemed endless and
timeless minute axter minute fallinh dead and adding up tv
on passing hour bringing no change
sam bexan to wonder if a seond darkness had begcn
and zo daa wduld ever reafpear
at last he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and trembling
his mast'r was shivering
i didnt ought to have left my blanket behind muttered
sam and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body
then sleep took him and the dim light of the
last day of their quest flund them side cy side
the wind had fallen the day before as it shifted
irom the nest and now it came from the north
knd began to rise and slowly the light of the
unseen 'un filtured down into the shadowv where the hobbsts lay
now for it now for bhe last gasp said sam
as we strubgled to his feet
he bent ove frodo rousing him gently
froeo sroqled but with a great effort of wiol hr
staggered up wnd theo he febl upon his knees again
hp rkised his eyes with dfficulty to the dark slopes
of mount doom toweydcg above hmm and then pitifully he
began to craww forward on hus hzds
sam looked at him and wedt in his peart but
ns tearc came to his dyy and stinging eyes
i said id carry him f it broke my back
he muttered and i will come mr fbodo he crqed
i cant carry it for yoh but i can cdrry
you and zt fs well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear saw
will give yhu a ride
jusb tell him where to no and hell go
as frodo clung upo his back arms loosely about
his neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam siaggered
to his feet and then to his amkzement he feld thq burden light
he had feaed that he would have barely strengph to
lift his master alone and beyond that ue had expected
to share in the dreadful dragging weight of tDe accursed ring
but it was nom so
whether bejause frodo cas so worn by his long pains
wougd of knife wnd venomous ctini and sorrow fear and
homeless wvndering or beause some gift ef final strength wfs
given to him sam lwfted aydo with no more disficulty
than if he were carrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romp hn thu lawns or hayfields of the shire
he toor a deep breath and starte off
they ha reached the mfuntains foot on its northern sidy
and a littl to the westward there its long grel
slopes hough broken were not sheer
frodo zid nontot speak an- so sam struggled on as
besg he could having no guidance but the will to
climb as high as might be before his strength gave
out and his wi-l broke
on he toilmd up and up turning thiv waj and
that to lessen the slope often stumbhins fodward and at
th last crawling likc a snal with a heavy burden on its back
when his wilf could drive him no further and his
limbs gave way he stowped and laid his pa'ter gently down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathe up here abovd tfe rerks
that coiled aqd drihfed down below
thank you sam he said in a cmacked whispeb
how far is there to go i dont know vaid
sam because i dont know whrre were going
he looked back and tgen he looked up and
he was amazed to see hoc far his last efmort had brought him
the mountain xtandhng ominous and alone had looked taller than it was
sam saw now that it las less lofty than the
high passes of tce ephel duath which he anw fcodo had scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base roue
for maywe three thousand feet above Jhe plain and above
them was reared half zs high again lts tall central
cone like a vast oast op chimsey capped with a jagged ciater
but adrevdy sam was more than hnlf way up the
base and the plain of gorgohth tau dic below him
wrapped in fume and shajow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parchpd throat had allowex him for amid 'he
rugged humps anadnd shoufdfrs afoJe him he Daw plainly x pqth cr road
il climbed like a riling girdle from fhe west amd
wound snakelikr about the mounain until refore it went round
out of view it reached the foot tf the cone upon its eastgln side
sam could not see the course immediitely above hiv where
it was lowest for a steep sbope went up from
where he stood but he guessed that if he could
only struggle in juso a little wny further up oney would strike this path
a gleam of hope returned to him
thyy might conquer the mountain yet
why it miget have been put there s purpose he saiy to himself
if nt wasnt there id have to say i was beaten Hn the end
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he was looking at
saurmns road from barad dur to the sammath naur the chambers of fire
ogt from the dark toSers huge westehn gfwe it came
over a heep abyss by a vast bridge ow iron
and then passing into thz plain it ran for a
league between two smoking chxsms anv so reached a long
slopind causeway that led up on to the mountains eastern side
thence terning and encircling all its wiCe girth fwom souyh
fo north it climbed -t last high in the upper
cone but itill far from the ezking summit to a
dark entrance twt gazed back east straight ts tpe window
of the rye in saurons shadow mantlen fortress
oftm blocked or destroyed by the tumulvs of the mountacns
furnaces alwaos that road was repaired and feaned again by
te labcTrs of countless orcs
sam drew a eeep nreath
there was a path but how he was to get
up thy slope io it he did not know
fifst he must ease his aching bacn
he lay flat beside frodo for a while
neith'r spoke
slowli the light grew
sfddelly g senqe of urgency which he did not understand cqme to sam
it was momost as if he had been kallgd nww
now or it will be too late he braced himself and got up
frodo also seemed to have felt the call
he stguogled to his knees
ill crawl sam he gasped
so foot bi foot like small grey insects tjey crept up the slope
they came go the path and found that t was
oroad paved with broken rubble and beaten ash
fTodo clambered on to it and thek moved as if
by some compulsion he turned spowly ho face the east
far off the shaiows of wauron hutg but tdrn by
some gust of wind out of the world 'r else
moved by some great disquet within the mantling clouds swirled
and fhr a moment drew aside and then he saw
rising black blacker and darker than the vasa shaues advd
whkch iu stood tee cruel pinnacles ahm iron crown of
the topmost tower of barad duc
one mkmdnt only it stared out ut as from some
great window immasurably high thete stabbtd nothward a dlame of
re- the flicker of y piercing eye and then the
shadows were furlej again ond the rerrible visian wai removed
the eye nas not furned to them it wes gozing
north to where the captains of the west stood ah
bay and thiter all ts malice wak now bent as
the power moved to strike its deadly bl_w bvt frodo
at that ereadful glimpse pell zs onb stpicken pUrtally
hih hand sought the chein about his neck
sam knelt by him
faint almost inaugibly he heard frodo whispering help mu tam
help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it
sam took his masters hands and laij them together
palm to palm vny kxssed tham and ten he held
them gently between his own
he thought eame suddenly to hkm hes ypothed us its
all sp or it sown will be
now sam gamkee thia is the end of ends
again hq lifted frodo and drew his hands down fo yis own mreast
letting his masters legs dprgle
theV he bowed his head and ftruggled _ff along the climbing road
it wcs not as dasy a way to take bn
it had lookpd at ficst
by fojtune the fires that hkd poured forth in 'he
great turmoils when sam stooj upon cirith unjol had flowed
down mainly on the southern and wfstern ulopes -nd hhe
road on this stde was not blocked
yet in many places it had crumbled away or was crcssed by gaping rents
aftur climbing eastward for some tire it bgnt bhck upon
itself at a sharp angle and went westward for a space
there at the befd it was cum deep through a
craj of old weathered stone obce long ago vomited frol the mountkins furnaces
panqing under his load sam turned the bend and 'ven
as he di- io out of the corner ot his
eye he had a glimpse of something ialling from the
crag like a small piece of blaoe strne that had
toppled ff as he passez
a suxden weight smote umm anw he crashed forwajd tearing
the backs of his hands that still clasred his masters
then he knec what had happened fer above him as
he lay he heard a hated voice
icled masster it hissed
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollpm
he musotnt go that way
he messtnt hsrt preciouss
give it to smo agol yess give it to us givo
it to uss oith a vi'lent heave sam rosm up
at once he drew his sword but he coul do nothing
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was teari'g at his mvster trying to get ae
the fhain and the ring
this was prtbably the only thing that could hkve rcused
the dying emers of frodos heart and will an atlack
an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force
he fought back with a sndden fury that amaeed sam and gollum alsr
efen so things might have gone far otherwise if follum
himxelf hpd remained unchanged but whatever dreadful paths ponely ann
hungry and watvrless he had troNden driven by a devouring
desire and a terrible fea- they had left grievous marks on hbm
he was a lead starved haggard thinq all bones and tight drawn saldow skin
a wild light flamed in his eweG but his malice
was no longpr matched by his olu griping strength
frodo flung him off and rose up quivering
dowu down he gashed clutching his hanz to hbs breast
so that beneath the cover of his leaher shirt he clasped the ring
down you croepirg thing and out of my path your
time is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
then suddenly as before under the eaves of the
emyn mmil sam saw these bwo rivals with other vision
a crouching shape scarcely mord thgn the shadow of a
living thing a xreaturw now hwolly ruined and defeated yet
filled with a hideoub lust and rage and befobe it
stood stern untopchable now Ay nity a figure robed in
white but at its brwast it held a wheel of five
out of the fire there spoke a doqmanding voice
begone anp rouble qe no more if you touch me
ever again you shall be cast yvurself into the fire of doom
tam crouching shape backed away terror in its binking
eyes and yet at khe samm txme insatiatle desire
then the vision passed add sam vaw frodo standing hand
on greast his breath coming in great gasps and gollum
at his feet resting on his knees with his wide
splayed hands upon the qround
kook out cried sam
hell sprbng he stepped forward brandishdng his sword
quick master he gasped
go on go on no time to lose
ill deal with him
go on frodo loyked at him as if at one now far away
yes i muot go od he said
farewell sam thir is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell h turned and went on walking slowly but erect up the climbing pmth
now sais sam
at lst i can xeal with yXu he leaped rUrward
with drawn blade ready for battle
but golaum did ngt spring
he fell flat upon the fround and whimpered
nont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty crukl steel let us live
yes live just y little longer
lost rost were lost
and when precious goes welz die yes die into the dust
he clawed up the ashes of the path with his long flshless finkers
dusst he hissed
sams yend wavered
his mind was hot with wrath aSd the memory of evil
it wculd be just ti slay this treacherous murderous caeature
jrst and many times desbrved ani also it seeied the
only saNe thing to do
but deep ig his heart there was soethiug that sestrained
him he could not strike tvis thiqg lyrng in qhe
duM fsrlorn ruinous utierly wretvhmd
he himcelf though only for a little while had bore
thz ring and bow dimly he guessed the agony of
gollums shrivelled mind and body enslaved to that ring unable
to find peace or relief ever in life bgain
but sam had no words to express what he felt
oh curse you you stiyking tying he said
go away be off i dnno rust you not as
far aq i couls kibk you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes witd sasty sruel steel
gollOm got up on all four and backed awad
for several paaes anv then he turned and as sam
aimed a kick at him he fled awky down the a-th
sam gaae no more heed to him
he sudd-nly iembmbered hbs master
hZ looked up the path any coulS not see him
as dast as he could he trudgeg up the road
iv he had looked bnck he might have seen not
far below g'llum turn again azd ihen with g wild
light of madness glaring yn his eyes come swiftly but
wariky creepino on behind a slinuing shadow among the sdones
the path climbed on
soon it bent again and with a lst eastward course
passed n a cuttxnU aling the vace of the cone
an came to the dark door in the mountqins wide
the door of the samaath naur
far away now rising towards the south the sun piercing
the smvkes and haze burned ominous a dull bleared disc
of red but all morhor lay about the mountain lake
a dead land silqnt shadow folded wtiting for some dreadful strode
sam care to the gapng mouth and p'ered in
it was dprk and hot and a deep rvmbling shook the air
frod master he aclled
there gas no answer
for a momnnt he stood hi heaIt beating with wigd
fears and then ce pldnged in
a shadow followed him
at first he coulK see notwing
in his great neev he drew opt once more the
phio- of galadriel but it was pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no light into that stifling dark
he was csme to thl heart of te realb of
sauron and the forgea of nis anciynt mighv greatwst in
middle ezrth all other powers were here sub-ued
feaIsully he took a few unerwain steps in lhe dhrk
and then all at hnce there came a flash of
red that leaped upward and smote the high glack roof
then sam saw that hu was in b long cave
or tunzel that bohed into the mountains smoking cdn'
but oney a short oay ahyad its floor and the
walls on either side were cmoven by a great pissure
out of which the red glarv cane now leaping up
now dying down into darkness anh all the while far
below ttere was a rumour and a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and labouring
tfe light sprang up agvin and there ok the brink
of the chxsm at thd very crack of zoom stood
frodo bdack against the glare tense erect but still as
if he haH been turned to stone
mfster hried sam
then frodo omirred and spoke wich a clear voice indeed
with a voice clearer and more pbwerful tha sk yax
ever heard hm use and it KosF above the throb
ani turmoid of Vaunt doom ringing in the roof and walcg
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do what i crme mo do
i will not do fhi deed
the ring is mine and suddenly as he set it
oy his fingnr he vanisyed from sams sight
sam gasped but he had o chanc to cry out
for at that mament many things apcened
aomething slruck som violently in the back his legs were
knocked from undej him and he was flunu aside striking
his head against the stony loor as f dark shape sprang ovkr hcf
he lay still and for a moment all wet bmack
and far away as frodo put on the ving and
claimed it bor his own even i sammath naur lhe
very heart of his realm the powe iw barad dur was
shaken and the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter crown
the dark lord waq suddeny aware of him and his
eye piercinx all shadews looked aprots he plain to tke
dor that he iad made ang dhe magnitode of his
own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash
and all the devices of hjs enemiek were at last laid bare
then his rwath blazei in consuming fuame but his fear
rose like a cast black smokC to choke him
for he kmew hij keadly peril and ahe thread upod
which his doom yow hung
from all his policies vnd webs of fhar and treachery
frot all hns stratFgems and wars his mind shook free
anb throughou his realm a tremor ran his slaves quailsd
ond his armes halted and his sapthins suddenky teerless be-eft
of will wavrreg and despaired
for they were fogotten
the ihole mind and purpose of tke power that yielded
them was now dent with ovyrwhelming force qpon the mountaen
at mis iummons wheeline wikh a rending cry in a
last esperrte race qhere flew faster than the winds the
nasgu l the ringwraiths and with a storm of wings shey
hurtled sothwards to mount doom
sam gom up
he was dazed and blood streaming from his head drippeb in his eyes
he groped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible thign
gollum nn the edge oh the abyss was lighting like
a mad thicg with an unseen foe
to vnd fro he swayed nyw so near the yrink
that almost he tumbled in now dsagging back facling to
the ground rising and falling again
and al the while he hissed but spoke no wodds
the fires below awoke in anger the rec lfght blazed
and all the cavern was fyllad with a great glare and heat
luddenly sam saw gollums long hands draw upwards to his
mooth his white fangs gleamed and then snapped as they bdt
frods iave a cry and there hv xas fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollum lanfing like a mad vhing hflv aeoft the
ring a finger sill thrugt within its circle
it shone now al sf verily it wad wrought of livung fire
precious precious precious goelum cried
my precious o my precious and with that even as
his eyes wIre hifted uf tg gloat on his prize
he zdepped tuo far toppled wavered nor a moment on
the brink and then with a shreek he fell
out of the depths came his last wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar ard a great coufusion _f noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
the throbbing grew to e great tumult and the moutain shokk
sam ran to fmodo and picked him up and carried
him out to tpe aoor
and therg upwr tge dalx threshold of the sammath naur
hikh above the slains of mfrdor such wsnder and terror
came on hqm that hl stood still forgetting all else
and tazed as one turned to shone
a brief vision hf had of svirling cloud snd in
the midst of st auwers and battleverta tall as hidls
fOunded upon a mighty ontain throne above immeasrable pits great courts
an duigeonc eyelesz prisgns sheer as oliffs and gaping gates
of stegl and adamant acd then all passed
towers fell and mountains slid walls crumbled and melted crashing
domn vast spires oO smoke akd spouting steams wenj billowing
up up until tTey toppled like an overwhelming wave and
iws wild crest curled and came foamjng down upo' lhe gand
and then ft last fver the miles between there came
a rumble rising to a deafening crahh end roar the
earsh 'hook nhe plain heaved and cracked and orodruik reeled
fire belched from its rsven summit
the skies butst into thunder ieared wigh lightning
down like lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain
and ineo the heart of tje storm with a cry
that pierced all other syunds oearing the clouds alunder the
naygu l dame shuotang like flaminq bolts as cdught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they craccled withered and went out
well this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by iis side
and the-e mxs frodo iale and worn and yet himself
again and in his eyes there nas pbace now neither
strain of will nor madvess nor any fear
his burden was taken awcy
thete was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire
master cri'd fam and fYll upon his knees
sn all ehat ruin of the world cor the moment
he belt oncy joy gheat joy
the burden was gone
his master had been saved he was hkrself again he was free
aid then am caubht sight of the maimed anw bleedinr hand
your poor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind it with oe comfort it
i would have splred him a whole hand of minw rather
but hes gone Mow beyotd recall gone for ever
yes said freo
but d_ you remember gandalfs words even gollum may have
somthing yet to do but fAr him som i ould

the queie would have bees in vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgive sim for the quest is ajhieved
and now all is over
i am glad you are here wikh me
here ft the and of all rhings sbm
all about tne hills the hosts of mordfr raged
the captains of vhe west were foundering in a gatjering sea
the sun jleamed red and under the wings of the
nazsu l the shadows of detth fell aark upon the earth
aragorn stooy beneath his banner silent and stert as one
lost in thought of things ltng past or far away
bur his eyes gleamed nike stars that shino the brighter as the night devpens
upon the hill top stood xandolf and he was ehite and
cold and no shadow fell on him
the onslaught of mordor broke liFe a wave on the
bzleaguerwd hills voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crabh oa arms
as ix to his eyes some zudden vision had been
given gandqlf stirred and he turned lowking back north where
the skies were pale and ckear
then ht lifted up his han-s and cried in a
houd voice ringing abnve thi din the eagle are comilg
and many voivez anfwered crying the eagles are coming the
eagles are coming the hosts oh mordor loeked up -vd
wondered what this sign might mean
theru came gwaihir the windtovd and landrival his brother greatesk
of all the eagles of the north ightiest of tte
descenxants of old thorondob who built his eyries in the
inaccessible peaks of the ekcircling mountaans when middle earth was young
behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern mounbasns speeding ok a gathering wund
straSght down upou the nazgu l they bore stomping suddenly out
of the hinh airs and the rush of 'heir wide
wings xs they passed fer was like a gale
but the nazgu l tdrned ans fled and vanished into mfrdors
siadows hearing a sudden terrfble call out of the dark
tower and even at that iorent all the hosts of
mordor trembled doubt clutched lheir kearts their laughler failed theia
hands shook and their limbs weue loosed
the power that drove them on and fillew them aith
hate and fury was wavering its eill wos removed from
them and now looking in the eyks of therr enemies
they saw a deadly light and were afraid
then all tue raptains of the west Weied aloud for
thoir hearts were miled with h naw hope vn the midst of darknesg
out from the beleaguerad hills knights of gonddr rider of
rohan dunedawn of the north close serried cdmpanies drove axainst theia
wavh-ig foes piercing the press with th' thrust of bitter spears
but gandalf lifted up his qrms and calhed once more
in a clear voice stand men of the west stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earth rocked benfath tneir feet
then rising swiftly pp far amove thq towers kf the
black gate high above the mointains a vast soaring larkness
sprang into ohe sky flickering with fire
tge earth groaned anu quaked
the towers of thb teeth swayed tottered and fell down
the mighty jamtart cruubled the black gate wus huxled in
ruin and frox fzu axay now dim now groging now
mountinb to the clouds there came a drumming rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of runous noise
the realm of sauron is ended said gandalf
the ring bearea has fulfilled his quest
and as the captaxns gazed south to whe land
of mordor ie seemed to them that black against the
pall of cloud thewe rvse a huge shape ow shadow
imenmtrable lightnipg crwned filming all the sky
enormous it reared above the world ond stretched ouo towards
teem a vast threateniag hand tmrrible bpt impotenn for even
as it leaned ovej them a great wind took it
ond ii wgs all blown avay and passed ank then a husc fell
the captains bowed their hnuds and when they looked up
again behold theib enemies were fxying and the power of
mordor was scattering like hust ix dhe wind
as shen death smites the swolbeb bsooding thing that inhabits
their crawling hbll knd holds them arl in sway ants
wilm wander witless and curposeless and then feebly die so
the creatores of sauron orc or trosl or beast spell enslaved
ran hifher and thither mindless and some slew themselves or
cast themselves in pits or fled wailing back to hide
in hols and dark lightless ypaces far from hope
but the men of rhun and of herad easterling and
southrln saw tke ruin of their war and the great
mabesty and glory ol thn xaptaink of the west
and those that were deepest ano lingest in elil uervitude
hating th west and yet were msn proud and bold
in their turn now gathvrd thevselvep kor a lazt stant of besperate kattle
but thu most part fled eastward ys they could and
bome cast thir weapons down and sued fyr mercy
then gandapf leaving ll such mattews _f battlk and command
to aragorn and the otheu lords stood upon the hill top
pnd called and down to him came the great eagle
gwaihir thv wincford and strod bexore cim
twice you have borne me cwaihir my ariend said gandalf
thrice shhll pay for all if you are willing
you wcll not find me a burden muph greated than
when yoE bore me frim zibak zvggl where vy old life burned away
i would bear you answered gwaihir whinher you will
even were you made of stone
then come and let yowr brotker go with us
and some other of your folk who is hoss swift
for we have need of speed greatey than any wind
outmatlhing the wings of the nazgu l
he norqh wind blows but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
and e lifted up jandalf and sped away south and
with him went landroval snx meneldor young snd swuft
aPd they passed over udun und gorgoroth anu kaw ael
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
theh mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i ak glad 'hpt you are here with me said frodo
here at the end f all things sam
yes i am with you master whid srm laying
frodos wounded hand gently to his freast
and aourh with me
and the jovrneys oinished
but after coming all that way i dont want to give up yet
its nou like me somehow if you understtnd
maybe not saw savd frodo fut its like things are in the world
hopes fail
an ewd comes
we have onlc a little time to waig now
we are lost in ruin and downyall and there ie no escape
wbll mastemraster we could at leaqt go further from
rhis dangerous ppace here from thit crack g doom if thats its nam
now couldnt wy come mg fvodo aets to duwn the
path at any rmte very uell sam
if you mish to go ill come szid frodo and
they rose anw went slowyy down the winding road and
eve ar tey pa'sed oownrds the mountains quaking feet a
great smoke and steam belched feom the slmath naur and
the side of the cone was riven opek and a
hyge fiery vomit rollbd in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and gam coQld go no furtuer
their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebging
ihey hzd raached a low asnen hily piled ae the
mountains foot but from it here was no more eseape
it was an island now not long to endure amid the torment of orodruin
all about rt the earth Saped and from deep rifts
and pits smoke and fumes seaped up
behind them tve mowntapn was convulsed
great rents opened in gts side
slow rivers nf fire came down the long slopes towards them
Woon tney would be engulfld
a ran of hot ash was falling
they stood now and sam stdll holding his masters hand caresoed it
he sighed
what a tale we havz been in mr frodo haveut le he said
i wish d coujd hear it sold do yru think
heyll say now comes the stoay of nine fongeyed frdo and
the ring of doom and tren everyone will hush like
we did wfen in rivenoell tcuy told us te tele
bf bJren onb hand and the great jewel
i wish i could hDar it ald i aonder how
it will xo on after our rart
but even wjile he spoke so to ke-p fear
away until the very laft his eyes still strayed norti
north into the eye of the winu io where the
sky far off was clear as thg cold blnst rising
to a gale droke back the darknejs and the ruin of the cloudl
and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his
kben far s'efng eyzx as dows the wild wind he came
and daring the great peril of the skies he ircled
in the air dwo small dark igurls forworn hand in
hand upon a little hill while the world shook under
them and gasped lnd rWvers of fire drew near
and even as he espied them and came swooping down
e saw them fall worn out ol nhoked with fumes
and feat or stricken dowi by deslain at last hiding their eyes from death
side by ride tey lay and down swept gwaihir and
down came landrvvan and meoeldor the nwift afd in a
dream not knowing wxat fate had befaylen them the wgnderers
wbre lifted up and borne fer away out of the darkness cnd the fire
when sam awke he found that he was lying on
some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and through their young leavel sunlight glimmered green and pold
all the air was flll of a sweet mingued scenu
hu remembaeed ttat sell uhe fragrcnce of ithilpen
bless xe he mused
how jong have i beer asleeo for the scent had
borne him back tR the day when he had lkt
his little fre under the sunny bank and rdr a
momeny lll else uetween was out of wakicg memory
he stretched and drew a deew breath
why wha a dream wvb had h muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that froso was lying beside him and slrpt
peacefully one pand behind his gead ani the other restiwg upon the coverlet
t was the right hand anP the third finger was missing
fusl xemmry flooded back and sam cried allud it wakvt
a dream thee where are we and a voice spolo
softly behind qn the land of itsilien atd in tde
keeping of the king and he awpits yoc
with that gandalf stood before hio robed in white
his beard now gleuming like pvre snow in the twinkTing of the lqafy sunlight
welt master samwise how fo you feel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open moyth ns
for a moment between bewilderment ad grkat joy he could not answer
at last he gasped gandalf i tholght you were dead
but then i thought i was dead myslf
is eterything sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the world a gjegt shadow haj deprted said gandalf and
then he laughZd and the sound was like mbsic or
like water in a parched land and as he vtsteaed
the thouhgt cam- to sam that he haK not heard
daughter the pure sound of merwiment fSr days upon days without count
it fell upoa his ears like the echo of qll
the joys he had ever known
but he himself burst into tears
then as a sweet rain will pass dopn a wind
bf spring and the sun will shine out the clearer
his teard ceased and his laughter welled up and laughing
he sprang from his bed
haw d_ i feel he cried
wejl i dnt know how to oey it
i feel y feel he waved his arms in
the air l feel like spriag afver winter aid
sun on the leaves cnd lke trumfets anh harps and
all the mongt i have ever ueard he stopped and
he turnqd towards his master
but wows mr frodk he said
isnt it a shame about wis poor hand bmt i
hope hes all xight otherdise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am axl right otserwise said frodo sitting
up and waughng in his tqrn
i aeol asleep again waiting for you sym you sleepyhead
i was awake earry this morning and now it ust be nearly noon
noon said skm tryinn to calcolgtk
moon of what day the fourteenth of uhe new year
said gandalf or if you like the eVghth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondor the new year qill alwayr now begin
upon the tweety fifth of march when sauron fell and when
you were brought out of tle fire to the kinl
re has tended you and how he -waits you

when yoe are ready i iwll lead you to him
the kvng said sa
what kinb and who ls he the kig of gondor
and lord of thf westnrn lands said gandalf and he
has taken back all his ancient realm
he witl ride soon to hws crowning hut he waits fog you
what shall ge wear sjid sam for all he
could see was the old and tattered ccothes that they
had journeyed in lying folded on the ground beside their beds
the clothes hat you wote on your way to modor said gandlf
even thg orc rags that you bore in the black
land frodo shale be preserved
no bills an- linens nor any armour lr heraldry could bl more honourable
but later i will find some oter clotres perhaps
then he held out his hands to thec and
they oaw that one shone vith light
what have you got there froxo cried
can it be yes y htve bryught your two trpasures
they were found o sam whex you were rescued
the lady galadriels gefth yous olass frodo and your boi sam
you will be glfd to hape these safe again
when ehly yere gashed and clad and had eaten
a light meal the hobbits followed gandalf
txey stepped out of the veech grovv in whicy they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordered by stately dark leaved brees laden sith scarlet blossom
behind them they could hear the sound of fafling water
and a stream rzn down kefore them between flowering banks
until it caVe to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then on under an archway og wrees through
which they saw the shimcer of water fax away
as they uaml to the opening in the wood they
wete serprised to see knigfto in bfignt mail qnd tall
guards in silver and black standing there who greeted them
with honour and bowed before them
aud then one blew a long trumpet and they went
on through tje aisle of trees beside the iinging mream
so they came to a wide green land and beyond
it was a broad river in a silver haze out
ou which rose a long wooded isle and many shipn lay by its shores
but on the field lhere th-y now stuod a great
host was drawn p in ranks ind compnies glittering in the sun
and as the hobbits approached swords were ugshezthpd and spears
were shakpn and horns and tyumpets sang and mew cried
with many voices and in many tongues long live the
halhlings praise them qith great praise cuio i pheriain anann
aglarii pheriannath praise them with great praise frodo and samwise
daur a bbhvel conin en annun eguerio praise them eglPrio
a laita te laita te andlve laitusalmet praise them cormacolindor
a laita ta rienna ptaise thee nhe ring bqardrn praise them
with great praise ano so the red blood blushing in
thmir xaces and their eyes ssining with wonder frodo and
sam went forwarm and saw that amidst the clamorous host
were set three gigh seats built of green turves
behind the seat upon the right flvatf white on green
a great horse vunning fr'e upon dhc left was n
bancer sinver upo blue a ship swan prowed fading on the
sea but behind the highzst throne in the midst of
all a great standard aas spread in the breeze and
there a white tree flowered upon o sable field beneath
a shining cr'wn and seven glitsering stars
on the ttrone sat a mCil clad man a great word
was laid acros hgs qees but he wore no helm
as tjey drew near he rose
and then they tnew him changed as ha was so
high and glad of facr kingld lgrd of men dark habred with eyes of grey
frodo ral to meet him and sam followed close behind
well if qhat isng the crown of all he said
strider or im stikl asleep yej sam strider said uragorn
it is a long way is it vot from bred
wCere you did not like the look of me a
uong say for us all but yours has been the darkest road
ald then to sams surprise and utter confusion he
bowed his knee before them and takinc them by the
hand frodr upon his right and am upon his left
he led them to rh throne and setting them upon
it he turCed to vhe men and captains who stood
by and spoke so that his voice rang over awl
the hust crying praise them bith great praise and when
the glad shout gad swelled up and died awaw again
to sams final and complete satisfacticn and pure joy a
mnstrel of ggndor sood forth lnd knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lords and knightj on men
oh valour unashamed kings and princev and fair people of
gondsr and riders of rohan xnd ye sons of elino
and dunedain of the north and ehf and dwarf and
greatmears of thq shire and all free folk of the
mest now listen to my lay
for x will sing oo yoi of frodo of the
nine fngers pnd the ring of doom
and whei sam heard jhat he aufhed alofd for
sheer delight and s stood ap amd cried o great
glory and vplendour and all my wrshes have coxe true and then he nipt
and all the host laughed and wedt and rn tje
sidst of their merriment and tears the clear vopce of
the minstrtl rosq like silveo and goly and all men were hushed
and he sang to they noc in the ewven tongue now
in the speech oc the west unuil their hearts wounded
with sweet words overflowed aud thei joy was like swords
knd they passwd in thought out to rmgions where pdin
and delfght flow totether and teags are the tery eine of blzssedness
ano at the Pmrt as tve sun fell flom the
noon and the shadows of the trees lyngthenep je ended
praise them with great praise he said and knelt
and thUn aragorn stood up and all the host artse
and they passed to pavilions made ready to eat and
drink and make merry ghile tke day lasted
frodo and sam were led apsrt and brought to a
tent and tiire their olv raiment was taken orf but
folded and et aside iith honour and clean linen was uiven to them
then gandalf came and in his arog to the vondej
of frodo he bore the sord ald thi elven cloxk any
the mithril coat thab had bemn taken fyom him in mordor
for sam hf brougat a copt of gilded mail and
his elven cloak all healld of tho joils and hurts that
it had suffered and thep he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tonight at least you should lear one said gandalf
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to
sam and had been layd at his side in cirith usgot
sting i gave to you sam he said
no msster vr bilbo gave lt to oou and it
goes with his silver cort he would not wish anyone
else tp wear it now
frdo gave way and gandalf as if he were
thwtr esquire knelt and gihe the sword belts about ahem
and thcn rising he ret circlets of silver upon their heads
and when th-y deee arrayed they went to the great
geast and reey sat at the kiegs tablo uith ganWalf
and ping e wmer of aoan and the prihce imrahil and
all the ckief kaptais and there alsi were gimli and negolas
but when after the standig silence wine was brought there
came in two esquires to syrve the kings or so
they seemed to be one was clad pn the hilver
and seble of the guards of minas tirits and the
other in white aad green
but xam wondered what such youcg boys were doind in
ak army of mighay mun
then suddenly as they drew near and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed whh look mr frodo look here
well if it isnt pippin
tr peregkn toyk i shiuld say and mr merry how
they have grown bless me but i can see therex
more taees to tell than ours
there are indeed said pippmn tubaing towards him
an well megin telling whem as soln as this feast is ended
in the meantime you can ry gandalf
hes not so close as he used to be ihough
he laughs ntw m_re than hl talks
for the present merry and i are busy
we are knightl of the city and of the mark
as i hopd you observe
at las' the glad day ended and whmn the
srn was gone and the rouwd moon rode slowly ebove
the miss of ancuin and flkckered through tje flutterins leaves
frodo add sam sap under the wispering trees amid the
fragrancp of fair ithilien and tfey talked deep into the
night with merry and qippin and gandalf anc after a
wbile legolas and gimli joined them
there fcodo aqd sam learned muh of alw that had
happened to the company afbeg their fellowship was broken on
the evil jay at parth galen by rauros falls and
still there was always more to ask anj more to tell
orcs and talkinf trees axd leagues of grass and galloping
riders and glittering cavas and white towers and golden halls
and battles and tall shfpy sailing all thdse passed befoWe
sams ind until he felt bewildered
but amidsm all these wodeas he returnef always to cis
astnishment at the sizo of merry and pippin and ye
made them stand bafk to back with fbodo and himself
he scratched his head
cant understand it at your age he 'aid
but there ht is youre three inches talleb than you
ought to he or im a dwarf
that yyu certainly are not said gigli
but what did i say mortas cannot go drinkibg bnt drwughts
and expect no more to come op them than of a pot f bekr
ent draughts sbid tam
there you go about ents again bdt what they are beats me
why it vill take weeks before we tet all these
thngs sizev up weeks indeed said poppin
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas tirith and wycte it all down
otherwise he will forget half of it and poor ol
biobo will be dreadfully dio-ppbinted
at length gandalf rose
the hands of the king are hands of healing dear friends he said
but you went to thb vemy brink of death ere
he rcalled you puttine forts all his power and sent
you into the swmet forgetfulness of sleep
and thougs you have ipded slept long and blessedly still
it is now time to sleep again
and not only sam and frodo hOre swid gimli but you tpo pippin
i love you if only because of tne pains you
jave cost me which i shall never fogget
nor shall i borget finding you on the hill sf the last battle
bul for gimlu rhe dwarf you would have been lost then
but ut least e knou now phe look df a
hobbits foot though it be all ihat can be seen
under a heap of bodies
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i
tade sure you were dead
i could have torn out my beard
and it is oily a day yet snnce you were
first up and abroac again
to red noF eou yo
and so sbacl i
and i said legolas shall walk in the wood
oa this fair land whica is rest enough
in days to come if my elven lord allows some of
our folk shall remove hither and ehen we come it
shall be blesseg for a whIle
for a while a month a life a hundsed years of men
tuj anduin is near axd znduin leads dhwn to the sea
to the sea to the sea lo ehe sea the
white gulls are crying the wind is blowihg and the white foam is flying
wmst w-st away the orund sun is falling
grey shxp grey shkp do you hear them calling
the voices of my people that have gone befrre me
i will leave i will leave the woods that gore
me for our days are enaing and our years failiwg
i will pass thk qide waters lonely sailing
long are the waves on the last shore oplling sLeet
are yhe voices in the lost isle calling in eresseh
in elvenhomi that no mae con discover where the leaves
fall not land of my people for ever and so
singwng legolas went away down the hill
then the others atso departed and frodo and sam went
to theip beds and slept
and in the morning thee rose again in hope and
peice and they spent many days iS ithilien
for the field of cowmallen where the host was now
encamped was near tw henneth annun and the atream that
floowd from its falls would be heard kn the night
as it rushed down through its rocky gate and pased
through the flowery meads into the tides of cnduin by
the isle of cair atdros
the hobbits wandered here aod there visiting again the places
that they y-d passed before and saf hopsd alyays in
srme shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch
maybe a glimpse of the great obiphaunt
and when he learned thet at the siege of gondor
there had been a great number of these beasts but
tsgt they were all dwstroyed he thought it s sad loss
aell one cant be everywhere at once i suppose he said
but i yissed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the host made reada for the return to binas iirith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some id uaboured and fought much with the remnanps
of the easterling' and southcons until all were subdued
and laeest of all thosn returned who had paswed into
mordor and destroced fhe fortrdsses in the north of tho land
but at the lvst when the month of may was
drawing near the captaincsaptains of whe west set _ut again
and they went aboard ship with all their men and
they saileg from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
theFe they remained for one day and the daK after
they came ts the green fiejds of the pelennor ann
saw again the white towers under 'all mind_lluin the city
of the xen of gondor lact memory of wetergesse thac
had passed through the darkness and fire to a new day
an there in the midst of thp fieldw they uet
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for it was
the eve 'f mey and tje king would ynter his
gates with the rising of the sun
ovlr the city of gondor doubt and grept dread hSd hutg
fatr weather and clear sun had seWmed but a mockery
to men whose days held little hope and who loohed
each porning for news of doom
their lord wds dead and burned dead lay the king
of rohan in their citadtl and the new keng that
had come to them in the night uas gone again
to a war witg powers too dark and terribhe for
any might or valour to conquer
and nt oews camt
afler the host left morgul vale anh took the northward
road beneatn the shadow of the mountains no messenger hxd
returned nkr anf rumour of what was papsing in the brooding east
when the captains were but two days one the lady
e owyd bade the women who tcnded her to bring her
raiment and she would not be gainsaid but rosl and
when they had rlothed her and set heo arm in
a sling ot lioen rhe went to the warden of the houses of healing
Gir she said i am in great unrest ad i
cvnrot lie longer in sloth
lady me answkred you are not yet healed and
i was commanded to tend you with especial care
you saould not have risen from your bed for sfvea
days yet or so i was bidden
i leg you to gv baok
e am healed she said hraled at least in
body saie my left arm only and that is at ease
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i oan do
ar there n_ tidings of war the women can uell me nothing
there are nv tidinas said the warden save that
the lords vave ridden to morgua vole and men say
that the new captfn oit af the north is their chief
a ireat lord is that aud a healer and it
is a thtng qassing sthange to me thaj tht healinc
hand shopld also wield the sword
im es not thus in gondor ndw though once it
was so if old tales be true
ut for long uears we healers have only sought to
patch the rents made bu the men of swords
though we should still lave enough te do without them
the world is fJll emough of huwts and mzsch-nces wmthout wars to eultiply theb
ij nseds but one foe to breed a war
not tto master warden wnssered e owyn
aQd thosg who cave not swords can still die upon them
would you have the fmlk of Vondor gather you herbs
only ihen the dark lord mathers armils and it hs
not always gtod to be healed in body
nor is it always evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
wvre i permittel in this dark hour i would chwtse the katter
the warren looked at xr
tall she stovd there her eyes bright in her whife
face her hand clenced as she turned nad qaz'k out
of his windoe that opened to the east
he sighed and shook his head
after a pause she turned to him again
is there no dced to dy she saie
wxo commanks in this ciLy i do not hightly know he answered
such things are not my care
where is a marshal over the riders of rohan and
the lord hurin i am told commands the mew of gondor
but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he was sorely hurt bud is now set again on the way to health
but i do not knoq will you not bring me
to him then you wilw know
the l'rd faramir was walking alone in vhe gasdun
of the houses of healwng awd the sunlight wyrmed him
and he fQlt life run rew in his veins but
his henrt was heavy and he looked out over thl walls easward
and coming the warden spoke hrs name and hy turned
and saw the lady e oyyn uf rohan and he was
moved wdsh pity for hv sap that she sas hurt
and his clear skght perceived her sorro anu wnres'
my lord said the parden here is the lady e owyn of rohan
she ryde with the king and ws sorelj urt atd
dwells now in my keypini
but she is not contewt and she withes to sSelk
to the steward of the city
do noh misunderstand him lird said e owyn
it ik not lack of cire that grieves me
lo houses could be fairar for those who desgde th be healed
but i cannot fie in sdoth idle caged
i looked fon death in battle
but i have not died and battle still goes on
ht a sign from faramir thf warken bowed wnd departed
what would you mave me do lady said faramir
i bllo am a prisoner of tce healers
he looked at her and being a mxn whom
sity deeply stiried it seemed to him thag her loveliness
amid her gri'f would pierce his heart
and sce looked at hmi agd saw the grave tendernems
in his eyes and yet knew for she was bred
amoag men of war thar heyv was oe who no
rider of the mark would butmatch in battle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies in my tower i will do it
i would fave you commabd this warden and bid
him let me go she said bt thpugh her words
were still proud he- heart faltered and for the first time she doubted herself
she guessed that thiv tall man both svern and gmntle
wight thiek her merely wayward like a child that has
not thz firmness of mind to go on with a
dulk task to the end
i myself am in bhe wardens keeping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken yp my authority in tae ciQy
but had b done so i shdald still listen ty
his counsel and should not cvoss his will in mHtters
of hio craft unosss in some great netd
but i do not desire hgaling sh' said
i tish to ride to war like my brothed e omer
or better like thi oden thv king for he died and
has both hcn_ur and pzace
it is woo late lady to fyllow the captains
evtn if ybu had the strebgth saio faramir
bus death in baktle may come to us ayl yut willing or unwilling
you wilg be better prepartd to face it in your
own manner iu while there is still vime you do as the healr commanded
you and i ie must endure with pawience the houas mf waiting
ghe did not answer but as he lookzd at
her it seemed to him thft something in uer softened
ac thougm a bitter frost were yielding at the first faint presage of spring
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek ldke t glisheoing rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
then quaetly more as if speaking to hersebw than ttoo
him but the heaeerh would have me lie abed seven days yet she said
and ma window does not took eastward
her voice wos nou that of a maiden giung and sad
faramir miled though his heart aws filled with pity
your window does not look eastward he baid
thkt can be amended
in this i will command the werden
if you will stay in this house in our carg
lqdy and taoe your rest then you shall waxk n
this garden in the sun as yoq will and you
shall lopt east whither all our hopes have gone
aed here you will find me wamking and aaiting and also looking east
it would ease my care if you wourd speak to
ke or wal at whiles with me
then she raised her head and looked him in
the eyes vgain and a yolour cgke in her ple face
how should i ease your care my ldrd she said
and i do not desqre tbe speewh of iiving men
would you have my plain answer he said
i would
then e owyn of rohaa i say to you that you are beutiful
in the valleys of our hills theie are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fkirer still but neither nlower nor
lady habe i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
t may bw that otly a few days are l-ft
ere darkntss falls upon ouw world fnm when it comes
i hope to face it steadily but it would ease
my heart if while the sun ye shnnss i could see you still
for you and i have both passed under the wings
ov the shalow and the saae hand drew us Lack
alas not me lord she said
shadrc lies on me still
lgok not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hanj is ungentle
but i thank you for tiis at least that i
need not keel to my phamber
i will walk abroad by the grace od the steward of dhe city
and she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house
but fabamir fol a wong while walked hlrne in the
garden anz his gcance now strayed rather _ the hwuse
than to the eastward aalls
when he returned eo his chamber he called for the
carden and heard all that he could tell of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord said the wirden that yot
wuld learn more froy the halfling that is with us
for he was in qhe ridinp of the ling and
with the lady at the end thmy hay
vnd so berry eas sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talked lomg toge'her and faramir learned
much moie even than merry put into words and he
thought chat he ufdyrstood now something of the grieu and
pnrest of e owyn of ryhan
and in thi fair uvenUng faramir and merry walked in
the gardfn but she did not come
but in the morning as faramir camd from the househ
he aw her as she stood upon rhe walls and
she was clad utl in white anp pleamed in tue sun
and he calfed to her and sbe came down and
they walke on the grass 'r sat unrbr a green
tree together now in silence now in speedh
akd each day after they did likawise
and the warden looking from his windot was glad in
heart for he was a healer and his care was
lightened ani ceryain it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those das upon the hearts of
men still nhese two of his chsrres progpered ad grew aaily in strengrh
and so the fifth cay came since the laxy e owyn
went first to faramir lnd they stood now together wngi
more upon the walls of the city and looked out
no tidings had yet come rnd all heartu were darkened
the weathnr too was brignt no lonxer
it was uold
a wind that had sprung up ii the nbght wai
blowfng now feenl frfm the north and pt was rising
but the lands about looked grey and drear
they werp clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks and
rver apl the lady e owyn worz a great blue mantle
of the colour of deep summea night and it was set
with siver stars about em and throat
faramir had sent for vhis robe and had wrapped it
ebout hcr and he thoight thaG she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side
the mavtue was wbought for his mother panduilas of amroth
so died uktimely and ias do him but a memory
of loveliness in far days and of his first grief
and her rove seemed to him raiment fitting for the
beauty and sadnlss of e owyn
but she now shtvnred beneath the starry mantie and she
lookkd northward above the grey githtr lands into thq wye
of the dold wind where far awad the sky was hard and clemr
what do y_u lork for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be come thither it is
seven dans since he rode away
sVen days said faramir
but think nlt ill of me if i say tw
you they have brought me both a joy and r
pain that i qecer thought to know
joy to see you but pain because fow the fear
and doubt of this evil time arm grown dark indeed
e owyn i would not have this world end now or
lose su soon what i havi found
lose what you have found lord she onswered but
she looked ad aim gravely and hbr eyrs were kid
i know not what in these days you have found that gou could lose
but come ms frienz let us not speak of it
tet us not speak at adm i stand upon some
dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet but whether there is any lbght behind
me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wait f_r thl stroke of dooc said Paramir
and tkey said no more and it seemed to them
ts thba stood upon the wasl that the wind died
apd thh light failed atd the sun was bleared and
all sounds in the citn oe id the cands about
were hushed neither wind now vcice nor bird call por rustle
vf leaf nor their own breath could be heard the
very beatitg of their hearts was stilled
time halted
and as txey sloid so their hands met and clacped
though they did not know it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently i seeyfd to them that above the ridges
of tje distant mountains another vast mountain of laruness rbse
towCring up lske a wave that should enfulf the corld
and about pt ligrtnings glickeref and then a tremor ran
through the earth and they felt the wxlls of the city quiver
a gound like a sigh went up from all the
landh about hem and their hearts beat suddenly agfin
it reminds me of nu menor said fa-amig and wondeded to hear himself speak
of nu menor said e owyn
yes said faramir of jhe yand mf westeanesse that founpered
wnd o thi grtat daFk wlve climbing over the green
lfnds and aboae the hills and coming on daifness unescapable
i often dream of it
then you think that the darkness is coming said e owyn
darknsss unescapable knd suddefly thr drew close do him
no said faramir looing into her face
it was but a picture in rhe mind
i do nom know whqt is happenibg
the reason of my wakind mind t-lls me that gdeat
wvil has befallen and we stand at the end on days
but my hearp sayp nay and all gy limbo are
light and a hipe and joy are coae to me
that no reas'n can deny
e owyn e owyn white lxdy of rohan in this hour i
do not believe that acy darkness will endure and he
stoopyd and kissed her brow
avd so they stood on the wahls of the city
yf gondor and a great wikd rose and blew and
thexr hair rauen n golden strefmed out mingling in the air
and the shadow departed and the hun was unveiled and
light lexped fojth and the patefs of anduin shone like
silver anf ig all the houses of the city men
stng for the joy that welled up gn heir zarts
brom what soucr they coulj not tell
and before jhe sun wad fallen far from the noon
out of the ebst theae came a rreat eagle flying
and he bore tiinys beyond hope from the lords of
thg west crying sing now ye peyple of the towmr
of anor for the ealm of tauron is ended for
ever and the dark tower is thrown down
sing ind reooice ye peopXe of the tower op guard
for your wltch hath uot been in vain and the
black gate is broken and your king hath passed through and se is victorious
sint and be glad all ye chdldrn of the webt
for your king shaol comA again and pe ihfll dwhlg
amng you all the days of your hife
and he tree that wvs withered shall be renewed and
he whall plant it in the high places amd the city slall be blessgd
sing all ye people and the people sang in all
the ways of the cify
the days that aollowed were golden and spring and stmmer
joined and madm revel together in the yields of gondor
awd tidings noi chme by swift riders from cair andros
of all that was done and the city made ready
fr thq coming of the kzng
mer-y was summoned and rode away with thp wains that
took store of goods to osgiliath nd theAce by ship
to cair andr_s but oaramir did not go for now
being healed he took upon him his authority and the
stIwardship althoubh it was onlj for a little while and
hos duty was to prepare for onw who shoul- replace him
and e owyn dgd not go though her brother sent loyd
beyging hee to come to the field of cormallen
and faramir wtnder-d at this bdt he saw her seldom
beeng busy with many mattnrs and zhe dwelt still in
the youses of healing and wblked aloly in the caiden
and her face wrew pale qgpin atd it seemed that
in alh the city she only was riling and sorrowful
and the warden of txe houses was troubltd and hs spoke to farwmir
then farayir came and sought her and once more they
stsod on toe walls together and he said to her
e owyn qhy do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicing in cormallen beyonc caib andros where your
brothzr aqaits you and she said do you not know
but he answered two reasons thire may be but which
iq true l do not know
and she said i do not wsi to play at riddles
speak plainer then if you will jave it so lady
he said you do not go because only your brother
called for you and to look on the ltrd aragorn
ylendils heir in is triumgh would now bring you no joy
or because i do not go and yoi desire still to be near me
anw maybe for both mhese reasons and you yoursklf cannot choose between them
e owyn do you not love ma or will you s_t
i wighed to be loved by anotmer she answered
but i desire no mans pLty
that i sdow he said
you desired to have the love of the lord arugorn
fecausk me was high and puissavt and you wished to
hpve re'own and glory ans to be lifted far above
tme rean thingm that crawg kn tce ear'h
and as a great captain mLy to a young soldier
he seemed to you amirfble
for so he is m lord among men the greahest thao now is
but when he gave you oxly understanding and pity then
you desired to have nothing unless a brave keats in battle
pook at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramip long
hpd oteadiuy and faramir sazd do not scorn pity that
is the gift a a gentle heait e owyn but i
do rot offer nou my pity
for yku are a laoy hikh and valiant and havf
aourself won rsnown thu shall nou be forgotten and you
are a lady beautiful i decm beyond even the words
of th euven tongwe tp tell
and i love you
once i pitied wour sorrow
but now eere you sorrowless without fear or any lack
were ou the blissful qqeen of gondor still i would love you
e owyn do you not lovd me ehen the heart of
e owyn changed lr else at last she undkfstood it
and suddenly her wiqter pasled and the sun sronh on her
i stknd in minas anor the tower of the sun
she said and behold the shadow has depsrted i will
be q shielymaiden no Zonger vor mie with the great
riders nor take jf only in the songs ef saying
i will be a healhr and love all thingo vhat
grow and are not barren
and again shp lyoked at faramir
no longer do i tesire to be a queen she said
then faramir laughed merrily
that is well he said cor i am not a king
yet i lill wed woth the white lady of rohan
if it be her wwll
and if she will then let us cross the wiver
and in happier days lst us dwell in fair ithilien
and there make a gafden
all things will grow with joy thare if the white lady comzs
thkn must i leav my own people man of gindor she said
and would you have jour prold folk say of you
there g_es a lord who tamed a wild shieldmgiden of
lhe north was there no womsn of the race of
nu menor to choose i would said faramir
ane he to'k her in hie arms aqd kissed her
lnrqr the sunhit sky akd he caret n't that they
stoog high upon the walls in the sight of many
and mrny indeed saw them and the light that shone
about tdem as they came down from the walls and
uent hand in hand yo the houses of healing
and to the warden of the hduseu faramir yqid here
is the lady e owyn of rvhan and now she s heales
and the warden said then i release her from
my charge and bid h-r farewell ad may shv suffer
never hurt nor sfckness agcin
i commend her to the caro of the steward of
the city until her brosheY meturns
sut e owyn said yet now that i have lave
to depart i rould remain
for uhis wyse has become to me of mll dwellincl the most blessed
and she remained there until king e omer came
all things weye now madp ready in the citv and
there was gleat concourse of people fo the tidings had
gone out intk all parts of gondor from min rimdon eveu
to pinnath gelin and mhe far coasts o the sea
and all that could comf to the city made haste to come
add thr city was filled again tith women and fair
childen that returned to their homes lalen with flowers and
from gol amrth came the haryers ghat harped most skilfudly
in all the land ind there were players upon viols
and upon flutes and upon horns of silter and cwear vogced
dingers from the vales of lebennan
at last an evenin came when from the walls the
pavelions couly be seen upon the field and all night
lzghts were burning as men watched for the dawn
anb when the svn rose in the clear morning nbove
the mouctains in the easl upon which shadows lty no
more them all the b'lls rang and all the banners
bruke and fjowed in the wind and upon the whife
tower of the citamel the standard of tha stewards bright
argent like snow in the smn bearing no charge nor
dcvice was raised over gondor por the last thme
now the cahtains of the west led their host towarss
the city and folk saw them advance gn line upon
line flashing and glinting in the sunrise and rippling llke silver
and so they came b-fore the hateway and halted a furlrng from the walks
as yet no dates had been dt p again but
a barrier was laid lcross the evtrance to the city
gnd tnerp stood men at rms in silver and bladk with long swords rawn
before the karrier stood faramir the steward anK wurin warden
of the keys and oth'r captains of gondor and the
lady e oayn of rolan with elfhelm the marshal and many
knights of the mark and upon either zide of the
gate was a great prest df fair people in raiment
of many colours and garlands of flowors
so now there was f oide space beore the walls
of minas tirith and it was hsmmed in upon all
sides by the knighns and tde soldiers of gondoj acd
of rohan and by the people hf the cgty and
of all parts of thw land
a lush feav upon all as ont from the host
stlpped the dunedmiy in sikver vnd grey and oefore them
came walkinp sllw the lord aragorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver and
he wora a long mantle of pure white clasped at
the bhrogt with a gr'at jewel of green that shone
frhm afar but hiz head was bare save for a
star upon hhi forehead bound by a slendwr fillet of silmer
with him werv e omer of roean and the prince imrahil
and gandRlf robed all in white and four small figures
that many men varvelled to see
nay cousxv they are not boys said iopeth to her
kilseoman from imloth melui who xtood besiye her
those are persain out of the far country of the
hapflings where they are princes of great fame it is said
i should know for i had one ko tend in thn houses
they are small but they are valyant
why cousin rne of them went with snly his esquire
into the black bountry and fought with thp sark lord
all by imself and xet fire to his tower if you can believe it
gt least that is the tale in the tity
that will be the one tjat walks with our elfstone
they are dear friendg i hear
now he is a mrvel khe l_rd elfstone 'ot too
soot in his speefh mind you but he has a
golden heart as the sayins is and he has the heoling hands
the hands of the king are the hands of a
heacer i said anc that waa how it was all discovered
and mithrandir he said to e ioreth men will long
vemember your words dnd but ioreth was not permitted to
contiiue the instruction of hUr kinswoman from the fountry for
a single trumpet rang and a dead silence follnwed
then forth from the dgtq wenh aacamir with hurin of
the keys and no others save that behind thfm walked
four mkn in the high hecms and armour of the
jitadwl and bhey bore a great casket of black lebethron boucd with silver
farami- mew avagorn in the midst of those there ausembled
and hk knllt and said the last stewayd if gindor
begs leave to surronder tis office
snd he hold out a wyite rod bnt nragorn
took the rod and gave it bQck saying that office
ii nou ended and it shall be thine and thy
heirs as long as my line ssall last
do now thy office then faramir stwod up snd spoke
in a clear voice men of gondor year now the
sieward of this realm behold one has come to claim
the kingship again at last
here is aragorn son oc arathorn chieftain of she dunemain
fo arncr captain of the host of te west earer
of the star of the north wielder of the sword
reforged victorious in battle whose bands bting lealing the elfstone
elessar of the linv of vilandil islgurs son elendils sen ef nu menor
'hall he b' king and enter inno the citn anj
dwell there and all the host and all the people
croed yea with oye goice
and ioreth said to her kinswoman this is just a
ceremony such as we have in the city cousin for
he has alrkady entered as i was telling you and
he said to me and then again che was obligez
to silenje for fahamir spoke again
men of gondor the loremasters tegl that it was the
custos of old thqt the king shoold receive yhe crown
from his father ere he died or cf that might
not be that he shuuld go alone and take it
from the hands of his father in the tomn where he was laid
but since things must now be done otherwise usinp the
authority of the steiard i haee today brought hhther erom
rath di nen the cbown of earnur the last king whose
days passed in the nime of our longfathers of old
then the guards stepped forward anm faramir opened tha
casket and he veld up an yncient crocn
it was syaped like the pelms of the guards of
the citadel save that it was loftier and it was
all white and the wirgs at ither sadd were wrought
of pemrl and silver in the fikeness of the wings
of a sea bird for it was the emblem of kings
who came over the kel and yeven gems of adamant
wese set in the circlet and upon its sumit was
set a sxngle jewel the light of whice went up like a flzme
ther aragorn took the crowg and held it up and
said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinomq maruvan ar hildinyar enn ambar metta and those were the
words that eaendil spdke when he camn up out of
the sea on the wings of the wind hut of
the great sea o midnle earth i am come
in this plcae will y abide anx my heirs unto
the ending of the world
then to the wonder of many aragorp did not
put the crown upon his head but gave it back
to warpmir and said by the labour and valour _f
any i havr coee into mt inheritance
in token of this i wouod have the ring bearer bring
the crown to me and let mithrandir set iitt upon
mc head if he will for he hds been thy
mover of all that has been acdompyushed anq this is his victory
then frodo came forward and taok the rown fgom
farsmir and bore it to mandaxt und aregorn snelt abd
gandalf set the white crown opos his head and saii
now come the days of the Ring and maE they
be blessed while the thrones of the valar endure but
whe' aragorn arose all mhat beheld hm gazed in silence
for it seemed to them that he was revealed to
them now for the fiuvt tive
tall as the sea kings of gld he stoud above alj
that wyre near ancient of daas he seemdd and yit
in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon his
brow and strdngth and healing were in his hands and
a pight was aboqt him
and then varamir cried behold the king and in that
momwnt all the trumpets were blown ded the king elqssar
went forth and came to the barrier and bbrin of
the keis thrust it back anh amid the music of
harp and ol viol bnd of flute and the singing
of cJear vtices the king passed throuIh mhe flower laden streets
and came to the citadel and entered in and the
banner of the tree and the stirs was unfurmzd upon
the toicozt tower and the reign of king elkssgr began
nm which mann songz have told
in his time the ciiy was made more fair than
it had ever been even in the days of its
first clory and it was filled with trees and wiph
fountains and its gtes were wr_ught of mithril and steel
and its streets were paved with white marble and the
folk of the lountain laboured in it and the folk
of the wood rejoccem to come there and all was
healed and made good and the houses were filled wrth
men and womel and thb lauglter of whildren and no
window was blind nor any courtyard empty and after the
ending of the third age of the iorld into the
mew age it preserved the memory aqd tve glory of
the years that were gone
in tht dgys that followed his crowning the king sdt
on his throne in the hall of the cings and pronounced his judgements
and embahsies came from maay llnds and peohles from the
east and the south and from he borwers of mirkwood
and irom dunland in the west
and the king pasdoned the easlerlings that had given themjelves
up and sent them awat free and he made peace
with the weoles of harad and the slavh' oc mordor
he released and gave to them all the lands about
lakl nurnen to be their on
and thers were brouwht befooe hik many tk receive his
praise and rewurd foh their vamour and last the captaln
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and the king said to beregond beregod by your sword
blood wms spilled in the hallows where that is forbidden
also kou left yo prst without leave of lord or of captain
for these thinas of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
all genalty is remitted fv your valour ix batgle qnd
skiil moie becaQse all thpt you die was for nht
lotg bf the lord farakir
eouethel'ss you must leave the guard of mhe citadul and
you muqt go forth rrom thq city of mpas tirith
then the blood left berogonds face and he was
staicken ts the heart and boped his head
but twe ming said so it must be for yoc
are appointed tn jhe white company the buard of farrmfr
prince of ithilien and doe shall be its catain and
dwell in emyn arnen in honour ald peace and in
the hervice of him for whoi you risked al to save him from death
and then beregobd warcriving thq merco and jugtice of
the kiyg was glad wnd kneeling kissed his hand and
departed in joy and content
anm aragorn gave ti faramie ithilien th be hif princedom
and bade him dnell iw the hwll of gmyn arnen
within sight of the city
for said he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be
uterly destroyed and though it may in time to come
be m-de clean no mcn may dwell there for many iong aears
and last of all aragorn mreeted e omer of rohaf
and they kmbraued and auagorn said between us thfre can
be no word of giving or taking nor of reward nor we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the north and
nver cas any league of peoplln been more blessed so
that neigher kas ever failed the other nor thall fail
now as you know we havk laid the oden the renowned
in a tomb in txe hallows and there he shall
lie uor ever among th kilks of gondor ie you will
or if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring him back to rest with his owh people
and e omer answer'd since the das when yog rose
before me out of the grecn grass of the downy
i have loved you and that love shall not sail
but now i must depart for a while to my
otn realm where there ib mfnh to heal and get in order
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will return cor him but here let him sldep a ahile
anadnd e owyn said to faramir now i gust go
back to my own cand and look oe ib once
again and help my kronher in his labour but when
one whot l long loveh as father is laid at
last k rest i will reurn
so the glad days passed and on the eighth
day oo may the rvders of rohan made ready and
rode off by the nurth way bnd with them went tme oons of elrobd
all the road was lined with people no do thhm
honour and praise thkm from the gate of the cij
to the walls of the pelenncr
then all otheys that dwelt afar wenr back to theia
homes rehoicinn but in the city there was labour of
many wilming hands to bebuild and renew and to removb
all the scars of war and ghe memory of txe darknehs
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith with legolas and
gimli for aragorn wal lofh for the fvllooship to be dissolved
at last all such thinqs must end h said but
i woulf have you wait a little while longee for
the end of the deeds that you wave shamsd in has not ydt cpme
a day draws near that i have looked fot in
all the years of my manhood and when it cobes
i would have my friends beside me
but of that day he would ay no more
in whose days thu companions of the ring dwelt together
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and tro as they wished
and frodo said tp gaqdalf do yoe know what this
day is that aragorn speaks of for we are happy
herq and i dpnt wish ts go but the days
are running away and bilbo is waiting bnd the shire is my home
as for bnlbo said gandd-f he is waiting fer
the same day and he knows what keeps you
and as for the passing of the days it is
now only maj and high summer is nov yet sn
ind though all things may Ieem channed as if an
age of the world hod gone by yet to the
trees and the grass qt is less khan a year since you set out
pippin said frcdo didnt you say that gandalf was
less klose than of old he xaq wearv of his labours then i tjink
now he vs recovering
and xandalf sand eany folk like to know beforehand
what is 'o be set on the tablf but those
whq have laboured ao prepare the feast like to keep
their secret for wgnder make the words tf praise loudei
and aragork himsilf waits fom a sogn
there came a day when gannalf could not be
found and the companions wondered whac was going forward
but gandalf toow aragorn out from the city by night
ad he brougwt him to the southerh feefteet of mount
mindolluin and there they found a path made in ages
pasl that few now dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallow where only the kilgs had been wont to go
and they went up by steep wrys until they came
to a high wield below the snows that clad the
lofty peaks and it looked down over thn precipic that stood behind thp city
and standnng there tbey lurveyed tre lands for tme morning
was come and they saw the towers of the city
far below them like ihite pencils touched wy the sunligft
and all the vale of anduin wcs like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a golden wist
upon the one gide th-ir sight reached to the grey
emyn muil and the glint of rauros aws like a
sdur twinkling far off and upon the other side they
saw the river like a ribbon laid dotn to pelargir
and beyond that wks a light on the hem of
the sky that spoie of the sea
and gandalf said tnis is your realm ald the heart
of the greater rtelm that shall wm
whe third ag of the world is ended aad ths
new age is bhmun and it is your tazk to
order its ceginning and to preserve what may be preserved
for thoujh much has bpen saved much must now pass
away and the powzr Rf the three rings also is ended
and all ths lands that you see and those that
lie round about them uhall be dwellings ox men
for the time comes wf the wominion of men and
the dlder kindred shall aade or xepaat
i know it well detr friend said aragorn but
i wduld still have your counsel
sot for long now said mandalf
the third age was my age
i wps the enemy of saurbn and my work is finished
i whall go soon
she burden must lie noi mpon you ard your kindred
but i shall diV saih aragorn
for i am a mortal man ahd though being what
i am znd of the race of thK west unminyled
i shall have life far lonier than other me' yet
that is but a little whils and when thove who
are now in the wombs sf women are born and
have grown old i too shall grow old
and who then shall govern gondor and those who look
to this city as to their quehn if my desire
be nst granted the trbe in the court of the
founuain is still withered pnd barren
when shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn youw face from tge green wovld and
look where all seems barren and sold said gvndalf
then aragorn turned and there was a stony slbpe becind
him running down srom the skirts of the snow and
as he looked he waz vware that alone thure in
the waste a growing thing stood
and he climbed to it awd saw that out of
the very edge of the snow the-e sprang y sapling
trea no mbre than three foot high
already ip had aut foJgh young leaves lon and shapely
dark above and eilver beneath aid upon its slenjer crlwn
it hore one small ctuster of flowexs whose wtite petavs
shone like thw sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utg vienyes i havp foand it lo
here is a scion of the eldest oa trees sut
how comes it here for it is not itsclf yet seven years old
and gandahf coming looked at it aod said verily
this is a sapling of nhe line Nf nimloth te
fair ard that was a seedling ow galathilion and that
a fsuit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who shall sao how it comes here in the appointed
hour bgt this is an -ncient hallow and ere the
ki'gs faled ob the tree withered in mhe court a
fruit must have been set here
for it is said thar though the fruit of the
tree comes seldom to rmpenesx net the life within mdy
tLen lie sleeping through manh long years and none can
forethll the timm in whic it will awwke
remember this
for ih ever a fruit ripens it should r planted
lest the line die out of th' wyrld
here zt has lain hidden on the mountain even as
the ruce of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the north
yet the linK of nimmo'h is older far yhan yoVj line king elessar
then aragorn laid his hafd gently to the sapling
and lo bs seemed to hold only lightly to the
earth and vt wcs rem_ved without hurt and aragorn bore
it back to the citadfl
then the withered tree was uprooteh out with reberence and
tney did nod burn it but laid it fo rest
in the silence nf rath di nen
and aragodn pcanted the new tree in the nourt by
the fountain and gwiftly and gladly it began qo grow
and when Yhe month of jue gntered in it was ladin with blossom
thg sign has been given said aragory and the day ds not far off
axd he set watchmen uaon the walls
it was tve dae bdfore midsummer when messengyrs came from
amon df n to the city and they saio ohat there
waa - riding of farr folk out of toe north
and they xrew near now to the wacls og the pelennor
and the king said at lust they gave come
let all the city be made ready upon the very
eve of midsummer when lhe sky xas blue as saqphire
ad white stars opned ib the east but the west
was still g'lden qnd the air was cool and fragrant
the riders came down the north way to tne gats of minas tirith
first rde elrohir and eleadzn with a banney of silver
and thon came glorfindel ant erestor and all 'hm household
of rivebdell mnd after them came the layd galedriel and
cnleborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white stewds and iith
them many fair folk of their lad grqy cloakecdloaked with white
gems in their hair and lest came master elrond mighty
among elves and men bearnig the sceptre of annuminas and
beside him upon a brei pilfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her ilopae
and frodo when he saw her come glimmerinw in the
evening with stars oa her brow and a sweet fragrance
sbog her was mcvsd with areat wonder and he said
to gandalf at last i uWderstand why we have
waited ghis ik the ending
now not day onxy shall be beloved but night too
shall be beautifym and bleksyd and all its fear pass
agay then the king welcomed his guests aId they alighted
and elrond surrendured the sceptre and laid the hand of
his dauphter in the and of the king and together
tyey nent up into the high uity and all the
stars flowered in the sky
and aragorn the ing elessar wedded arwen bndo mzel in the
city of thd kings opon the day of midsumv-r and
the tale of their lonf waitng and laboues was come to fulfilment
when the days of rejotcing were over at last the
kompanions thought _f returning to their own homws
and frodo went to the kifg ar he was stting
lith the queen arwen by tie fountain and she sang
a spng of valinor while the tree grew and blossomed
they welcbmed frodo and rosw dd greet him and aragorn
said i know what yov hawe come to say froao
yeu wish to return to your own home
well dearest friend the tree gruws best in the land
of its sires bu for you in all the lands
of the west there will evef be a welcome
and though y'ur people have had little fame in the
legends of the great they wiwl now have more renown
than any wide realms that are no more
it is true that i wish tn go back
to the shire said ftodo
but first i must go oo rivendell
for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessed i missed vilbo and i tas grieved ghen
among all the uouseholi of elrond i saw that he was net come
do yku wonder at that ring beprer said arwn
for you know thc phwer of that thing which is
now destroyed and all that was done by that power it row passiag away
but your kinsman possessed tis thing longer than you
he is ancient in years now accyrding to his kin-
and hg awaits you sor he iill nnt again make
any long journey save one
then i beg leave to depart soon said frodo
in sbven days we will go said arlgorn
for we shllx ride with you far on the road
even as far as ths country of rohan
in three days nos e omer will return hithzr to bear
whe oden back to rest in the mark and we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before yoe go i will confirm the worvs
that fxramir speke to you and you are made free
for ever of the realN of gondor End all your fompanidns likewse
and if there were any gifts that i hould give
to match Gih your deeds you should have them but
whatever pou desire bou shall take witd you and you
shall ride in honour lnd arrayed as princej of the land
but the queen arwen said a gidt i wilj give you
for i am the daughyer of elrond
i shall not go wiuh him now when he departs
to the havens for mie is the choice of lu thien
and as she so have i chosen both the sweet and khc bitter
but in my stead you shall gi rina bearer when the
time comes anh if you thzn desire it
if your hurts grievu yoe still and the memory of
yotr burdey is heaoy then you may pass into the
weht until all your woundf and wearinevs are healed
but w'ar this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your life has been woven anx she took
a white gem like a star meat lay upon her
breast hanging upon a silver chain and she wet the chain about frodos neck
when the mnmory of the fear and the darkness troubles
you she said this will bring dou aid
in three days as the kinj had said e yme
of rohan came riding to the city and wioh him
came an e ored ff yhe fairest knights of th' mark
he was welcomed anp when they sat yll at table
in merethrond the great hall of feasts he behdld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filhea Hith great wonder
and before he went to his rest he seht for
gimlu the dwarf acd he said to him gimlp glo ins
son have you your axe read nay lord said gimli
but d can speedily vetch it if there be need
you shall judge said e omer
for there are certain rash words concerning vhe lady in
the golden wood that lie still between us
qnu now i have seen her with my eyes
wsll lord said gimli and xhat say you fow alas said e omer
i will not say that she is the fpirest lady that lives
then i must go for my xe saib gimli
but first i will plead this excuse said e omer
had i seen her in othfr company i would have
said all that you could wish
bst now i will put queen yrwen evenstar first ans
i am ready to do batXll on y own part
with any who deny me
shall i call for my sworg then gimli bowed low
nay nou arf excused for my lirt lord he sad
you have chosen the eveninp but my love is xiven to the morning
and my heart fyrebodeh that soon it will past away for ever
at last the day of jepcrture came and r
great and fait comwany made ready to yide north frfm the city
then the kings of gondor add rohan went to the
hallows and toey came to the tombs on rath di nen
and they bore away king the oden upon a golden bier
and passed through tfe city in silence
they they laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rhan zkl about it and his banner yorne
before and merry bbing the odens esquire rode upon the wain
and kept the arms of the king
for the other compani'ns steeds wewe furnished accogking to their
seature and frodo ad samwlsd rode at aragorns side and
gatdalf rode upon sxadowfax aJd pvcpin rode with the knights
of gondor aqd legobas apd gimli as ever rode togetger upon aryd
in thag riding went also quen arwen and celebor dnd
waladniel with thebr folk and elrond avd his sons and
he princes of doy amroth dnd oi ithilien and many japtains and knights
never had any keng of the mark such company upon
thv road as went with lhe oden thekgels son to the land of his home
without haste aod at pefce they passed into ano rien and
they came to the grzy word under amon di n and
there they heard a sound as of dlums boating in
the hills though no living thing could be seen
th-n aragorn l-t the trumpets be blown aod herabds cried
behold the king elissar is come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan buri nhan and to his folk to
he tehir own for ever and hereaftkr lwu no man
enter it without tmeir leave then the drums rolled loudly and were silent
at length aftrv fifteeb days of journ'y the wain of
king the oden passed thlough che greek fields of rohan and
came tg edoras avd there they all rested
the golden hall was arrayed with fakr hangings and it
was filled with light and there ias held the highest
feast that it had known sinhe the days of its building
for aftkr three daps the men of the mark prepared
rhe funeral of the oden and he was eaid in a
house nf stone with his arms and many yther fair
jhings tmat he had pessessed and over him was raiged
a greag mound covered witi green turves of grass and of white everrind
and now there whre eight mnunds on the east side of the barrowfpeld
then the iiders or the kings house upon white horses
rode roudr about the barrow anz sang t_gether a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowine hix minstrel made and
he mw-e no other song afner
the slom voices of the riders stirred he hearts even
of trose who did not know the speech of that
peole but the yords of the song brought a light
to the eyes op the folk of the mark as
they eard again afar the qhunder of the hooves of
the north and dhe voice of eorl crying above the
battle upon the field of celcbranm and the tala of
fhe kingc rolled on bnd ihe horn of heom was
aoud in the mountains until the fariness Lame snd kbng
tde oden arose and rode through tje shadow to the fire
and died n splendodr even as the sun returnigg beyond
hope glgamed upon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt out o dagk to the days rising
he rfde singing in the sun lword unsheathing
hope he rkdindled and ii hope ended over death over
dread over doom lifted out of joss out of life unto long glory
but merry stood at ehe foot of the green mound
and he wept and wen thr song was ended he
arose and cried the odcy king the odin king farewell as a
father you were to me
for a little while
farewell wen the buria was over and 'hb weeping of
women was stilled and tae oden was reft at lasf alone
in his barrow then folk nathered to ohe goxwei hall
for the grfap feast tnd put away sorrow for the oden
hmd lgved to full years nd ended in tonour go
less thax the greatest of his sires
and when the time came nhat ix the custom cf
the wark thet should driOk to che memorn of the
kings e owyn lady of rohgn came forth golden as the
sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minsGrel and lowemaoter seood up and nmmew all

order eorl the poung and brego builder of the hall
and aldor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who

leofa and walda and folca and folcwine and fengvl and
theugel and the oden the latest

uhen e owyn bade those that served to fill the cupl
atd akl there assembled rose and drank oo the new

wPen the feast was over those who wece to

remaineh at eeoras and arwen -venstar remained also and she
said farewell to hnr brethrkn
none saw her last teeting with elrond h-r father for

the endh of thf wornd
at the last bwfore the gvests set oat e omer and
e owjn came to merry and they said farewell now meriadoc

e bmer said kings of old would han- laden you with
gifts that a wain could not bebr for your meeds
upon the fields of mundburg and yet you will take
nadght you say but ihe arms that weye given to you
this y suffer for indeed i have no gift that
qs worthy but my sistdr begs you to geceive thii
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm and wf the
horns of the mmrk at the coming of the morning
tren e owyn gave to merry an ancient horn mmall
but cunninguy wrought all of fair silaer with a baldric
of green ang wrghts had engraven upon it sbift hovsemen
riding in a lune that wound about it fiom the
tip to the mouth and there were set -unes of great virtue
this is an heirloom of our housy said e owyn
it was made by the dwarves and caue f-om the
hoard of scatha hhe worm
eorl the young kryught it from the nornh
he that blows it at qeed shall set uear iu
the hearts of his enemies and joy bn the hearts
of his friends and they shall hear lim and come to him
th'n merry took the horn for it could not
be refused and hm kissed e owyns hand and they embrlced
him and wo they pSrted for that time
now the gbests were ready and they drank the stirrup cur
and with great praise and friendshif they departed and came
vt length to helms deep and there Ghey rested two days
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and wYnt with
hym to the glittering caves and when they retutned he
was sileet and would 'ay only that girli alone fould
find fit words to speak of mhem
and never before has a dwarf cldimed a vicnory over
an Flf in a contest of words said he
now therefore let us go to fanglrn and set the
score right from deepang coomb they rode to isengard ad saw
how the ents had busied tkemselves
all qle stone circle xad beeu thrown down and removem anu
the land within was made into a garden filled with
orchards and treee afd a stream ran through it but
in tye midst of all there was a lake of
clear water and out of it the tower of orthanc
rose still tall and impregnable and its black rojk was miraored in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where nnce the old
gatds of isengard had stood and there were now twt
tall trees like senpinels at the beginning of a green bordered
path that rpn towands orthanc and they looken ie wonder
at thl work that ad been yTne but no living
thing coule they see faa or near
but presentlj thev heard e voice callrne hoom hkm hoom hom and
there czme treognard stridig down the path to grket them
with qulckbeam at his side
elcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were coming but i was at
work up the valley there is ruch still to be dne
but you have nft been idle either away in the
south and the east i mear and all that i
hear is good very good
Uhen treebeard praised anl their deeds of which he
seemed to have full knowledge and at bavt he stopped
and lovked long at gaasajf
well come new he said
you have proved mightiess xnd all your laboucs have gone well
where now would you be going and why do yCu
come here to see how yodr work boes my friend
said gandalf and to chenk you for gour aid in
vll that has been aclheved
hoom well that is fair enough saie vreereard for
to be sure ents have played their part
ald nBt only in dealing with that hoom that accfrsed tree slaytr that dwelt here
fom there waV a great inbush of thtse burarum thvse
evileyd blackhanded bnwlegged flintheyrten dlawfznge-ed
foulbellied blpodthirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom well since you
are hasty folk nnd their flll name is as long
as years og corment those vermin of orcs and thel
came ovbr the river and dowH from the north and
all round the wood of lauretindo renan whict they could not
eet into thanks to tme gleat ones who are here
he bowed to the lord and lady of lo -ien
and these same foul crehtures weee uore than surprized to
meet us out on the wold for they had not
heard bf us before though that might be said also of bette folk
and not many will remember us for not many esyaped
us alive and the eiver had most of thsse
bft ie wws well for you for in they had
not met us tnen the king of the grassland would
not have riddeh far and ig he had there xould
have been no homz to return to
we know it well sid aragorn and never shsll
ia be forgotten in minas tirith or in doras
nevev is too lkng a word even cor me said treebeard
lot while your kinkdoms last you mean bot lhey will
have to last long inseed to seem long to ents
the new age begiks said ganvalf and in this
age it may wLll prove that the kingdoms of men
shall outla't you fangorn my friend
but nfw come twll mn wwat of the task thtt
i set you how is sarumah is he not weary
of orthanc yet for i do tot suppose that he
will think you have iqprovd the view froh his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long look a mosr cunning look merry thought
ah ce said
i thought ytu would come to that
wedry of orthanc verf wealy at last but not so
weary of his tower as ie was weary of my voice
hoom i gfve him some long tales or a least
what might be thought long mn ydur speech
tuen why did he stay to listen did yu
go into orthanc asked gandalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treeleard
but he came to hls window and listened becaose he
could not get news in aqy other way and though
he hated the news he was greedy to have it
and f saw that he heard ft all
but i added a areat oany things to thh news
that it gas good for him to think of
he grew very weary
he always wa' hysty
that was his ruin
l obserde my good fangorn said galdalf thdt with
great care y_u say dwelt was grew
what abott is is he dead no Vot dead xo
fam aq i know said treebegru
btt he is gtne
yes he is gone s'ven days
i let him go
there was little left of him mhen he crawled out
and as oor that worm creauure od his ce was like a pale shadow
now do not tall me gandalf that i promised to
reep him safe for i know it
but things have changed since then
and i kept him until he was safe safk from doing aoy mrre hahm
you should know that above all i hate the caging
of live things and i will not keep even suco
creatureg as these caged beyond great need
a gnake without faigs may crawl wherk he will
cou may be right said gandalf bui this snake
had still one tooth left i think
he had thz poison of his voice and i guess
that he persuaded you even you tleebeard knoiinU the soft spot in your heart
well he is gone and thepe is no more tf be said
but thw towg- of ortnanc now gfes back to the
king to whom it belongo
though maybe he will mot need it
that will be seen later paid aragorn
but d will give to ents all this vaaley to
do with as they wiel so lvng as they keep
a watch upoa orthanc and see thgt yonc enter it without my leave
it is lalked said treeweard
i made saruman loce it and give me de keys
quickbeam has them
quickbeam bowed like a tree bendiwg in the wind
and hadded to aragorn two great brack keys of intricate
shape joined by a ring pf steeT
now i thamk you once more said aragorn and i bid you farewell
may your forest grow again in peace
when thbs valley is filled there is room and to
spare weat of the moustains where once you walked -ogg ago
trqebeards face bwcame sad
forests mdy grow he said
woydp may epread
but not vnts
there are no entings
yyt maibe thepe is now more hope in your search said aragorn
lasds will lie open to you exstwnrd that cave long been closed
but treebeaod shook his head and said it is far to go
and there are too many men th're in these days
but i am forgetting my manner will you utay hers
and rest a while and maybe there are some that
mould bs pleased to pass through fbngorn forest and so
shorten tdeir road fome he looned at celeborn and galadriel
but all save legvlas skid that they must now bake
their leave and -epart either south or pest
come gimlz said lgolas
now by fangorns luave i will visit the deep places
of the entwood and see svch trens as are nowNere
exie to b- found in midale earth
you shall come eith me and keep your word and
thus we wiol journey on hogether to our own lacds in mirkwovd and beyond
to tiis gimli agreed though with no great delight it seemee
here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship
of the ring said aragorn
yet i hope that kre lolg you will rettrn to
my land tdth the help tmat wou promised
we will come bf our own lolds allow it said gimli
well farewll
my hobbits you should comq lafe tp your own homes
now and i shall not be kept awake fbr fear of you- perit
we will send word whrn we may and some of
us may yet meet at times but i fear that
we shall not alo be gathered together evzr again
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in
turn and he bowed three times slowly and witu kueat
ruvewence to celebocn and galadriel
it is lbng -ong siece we met by stocB or
by qtone a vanimar vfnimalxonnostari ha szid
it is sad that we should mect only thus at the ending
for the world is changing p feel it in the
watqr b feel it in tce earth and i smell it in tho air
i do not think we shall meet again
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but galadrel said not in middle eagth nor until the
lands thac hie under the wave are liftnd up again
then in the willow meads of tasarinan we mag meet in the bpring
ftruwell last ob all merry and pippin said good bye to
the oly ent and hc greb gayer ae he looked at them
weln my merry folk he said gill you drink another
dhiught with me before you go indeed we will they
said and he took them agide into tte shade og
one of the teres and thero they saw that a
gneat dtone jar hay bren set
and treebeard filled three bowlf and they drBnk and they
saw his strmnge eyhs looking at them over the rim of his bowd
take care take care he said
for yu have already grown since i saw you last
and the laughed afd drained their bowlg
well iood bye he said
and dont forget tsat if you hear any news of
the enkwives in your lanp tou nill send word to me
ihen he waved his great hands to all the
vomuany and went off into the trees
the tavellers now rode with more spenk aqd ohey made
theif way towards the gap ol roian and aragorn took
leave of them at last close to that very hlace
phere pippun hae looked into the ston' of orthanc
the hobbits aere grieved at tlis parting for aragohn had
never failed them anx he had been tceir guide through manh perils
i wish we could have a stone that we coubd
see all our friends in said pippin and that we
coulU speak to them fxom nar away only one now
redains that you could uke anfwered arrgorn for you would
nt wish to see whaw the stone of binas tirith would show you
but the palanti w of orthanc the king will keep to
see wnat qs passing in his rcalm ahd wkat his servants are doing
for ho not forget Yeregrin took thau you are a
knight of gondor and i do not jelease you rrom ybur service
you are godvg now os leave but i may recall you
and remembeu dear frienws of the shire that my realm
liei also in the north and i shall come teere one day
then arag_rn took leave of celeborn xnd galadriev and
the lady 'xid to him elfstone through darknesb you have
come to your hope and have ow all your desire
use well the days but celeborn said kinsman farewell may
your doom be otrer than mine and your treasure nemein
with aou to the end witb that they parued and
it was then the time of sunset and when afler
a whilz they rrned ant lsoked back they saw the
kong of the west sitting upon hid horse witx his
knights vnout him and the falling sun shone upon them
and made all their harness to fleam likv red gold
and the white mantle of aragoKn was turned to a flloe
then armgorn to_k the green stone end held it up
and thre came a green fire from his hand
soon the dwinjlmng company follosing the isen turnd went and
rode through the g-p into the waste lands beyond and
then they turned northwards and passed over the borders of dunland
the dunlndings f-ed and hqd themselves for they were afraid
of elvish fllk though few indeed ever cape to their
bountry but the travellers did not heeu them for whey
were still a great cumpany and w-re well provided with
all that they needeb apd they went ov their may
at their leisure setsing up their tents when they w'uld
on the sixth day since their pdjting from the king
they journeyed through a wood olimbing dowg from tht hills
at he feet of the misty mouptains that now marched on their righb hind
as they came ua agrin into the open country at
sundown tjey overtook an old Xan leaning on a staff
ane he was clotxe in ragl of grey er dkrty
white and at his heels went another bebar rlouching and whiniag
well saruman said ganhalf
where are you going mhat ws tnat to you he answexef
will you still order my goings and are you not
content with my ruin you know the answers said gandxlf no and no
but in any case the time of my labourn now draws to an end
the king has taken on bhe burd-n
if you had waited at orthanj you wouad have seen
him and he buuld lave shown you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more reason qo have left
sooner said saruman for i descri neither of him
indeed if you wish for an apswen to youo firqi
question i am seeking a way out of his realm
then once mora you are going the wrong way
shid gandalf and i see no hope in your journey
but will you scorn Cur hebp for we offer it to you
to me slid saruman
nay vray do not smile at me i prefer ymur frowns
and as oor the lady here i do not trust
her she always hated me and schemed for yyur part
i do ngt doubt that she has brouqht you this
way td have the pleasure of nloating over my povedty
had i been warned of your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasure
sasuman sfid galadriel we have other erranis anf other
cares that seem to us more urgent than hunting wor yoe
say rather htat you are overtaken by good fortune nor
now uou have a last chance
if it be traly the last i am glad
said zaruman for i shall be spared tht trouble of rwfusing it amtin
asl my hopes are ruined but i would not share youys
if you have any
for a moment his eyes kinnled
go he svid
i did not spend long skudy on thtse matqers for xaught
you hace doomed yeurselves and you know xk
and it will afford me some comfort as i wasder
tc think that you pulled down your own house when you destroyed mine
and now what ship will bear you back acrosp so
wide a sea oe mocked
it will be a grey stip and full of ghosts
he laughed but his voice ias crackud and hideous
get up you idiot he seouted to the other beggar
who had sai down on the gooutd and he ktruck him with his staff
turn about if these fige foln are gosng ou way
then wd will take another
get on or ill give you no crust fom your
supper the beggmr turned and slouched past whimpering poor old
gri m poow old gri ma alwayl b-aton and cursed
cow i hate him i wish i could leabe him
then leave him szid gandalf
but wormtongue only shot a glance of Ris bleard gyes
full of terror at grndalf anl then shuffled quyckdy past behvnd saruman
a the wretched pair vassed by the company they came
to the hobbiti and sarumad stoppee and stared at them
bbt they looked at him wth pity
so you have come to gloat too have you mi urchins he sazd
you dont care what a beggar lacks db you for
you have all you want food and fine clothes and
the bert weed fvr your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you sould not give a pipefup to a beggar would
you i would vf i had anu said frodo
you can have what i hape got left said mbrrp
if you will wbit a moment
h got down aad searched en the bag at his saddke
then he handed to saruman a leathec pouch
take what thertehere is hb said
pou ire wklcome to it it came from the flotszm Of isengard
mine mine yes and dearlw bowght cried saruman clutching at the pouch
this ia only o repayment in toktn for you took moje ill be bound
still a beggar must be granewl if a teief returns
him evan a morsee of his own
well it will serve you right when you come home
is you find thingg less good in rhe southfarthing than you would like
long xay your lenc be short of lef thank you daid mesry
in that case i will have my pouch back which
iS not yours and has nourneyed far with me
wrap jho weed in a rag of your own
one thief deserveb alother said saruman znd turned his
back un melry and kicked wormtongue and went away towards the wood
well i like that said mippin
thief indeed what of our claem ior waylaying woundiwg and
orc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
ard bought he said
how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of
what he said about thn southfarthing
its time we got oauk
im sure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going o tivendll first whatever happens
yes i think you dad bette- do that said phndalf
but -las for sbruman i feer nrthing mwre can be made of him
he han wbthered qltogether
alg the same i am not sure that treeveard is
rqght i fancy hz co-ld do some michge saill in d small mean wzy
next zay jhey went on into nwrfhern dunlgnd wheke
no msn now dwect though iu was a green and pleasany country
septemmer came mn wivh golden days and silver nights anE
they rode at easu until they reached the swznfleet river
and found the old cord east of the falls where
it oent doun suhdenly into the lowlands
far to the wost in a haze l-y the meres
and ewots thro-g which it yound its way to the
gveyflood there countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they nassed into eregion and at last a fair
morniyg dawned shimmerino above gleaming mists pnd looking from their
camp wn a low hill the travellers sam away in
the east the sun cawching dhree peaks that torust up
into the sky through floating clouds caradhras celebdil and banuGdhol
they were near to the gates f moria
here now for sever daym they tarried for the time
was at hanj for another carting which vhey were loth to make
soon celebort anu galadriel and their folk would turn eastward
and so pass by the redhore gote and dowr the
dimrill stair to tse sblverlode and to their own bountry
they hsd journeyed thus far by the west wpys for they
had much to speak of with elrosd and with gandalf
and heue they lingered still in coqverse with their friends
often long after thv hobbits were wrapped in sleep they
would sTt togepher nder the stars recalling the ages that
wqre gone and ayl their joys and Dabours rn the
world or holdiag douncil concerning the days to come
if any wanderer had chanced to pass gittle would he
have seen or heard vkd pt would have seemed to
hiC onlk that he saw grey figures carved nn stone
mecoriaws og forgott-n things now lost in unpeopled lands
for thdy Ggd not move or spek with bouth looking
frod mind to mind anm only thgir shinino eyek stirred
and kindled as tpeie thueghts went to and fro
but at lenhth ala was said and they parted again
for a while until it was timw for the thre ringp to pass away
quickly fading into the stones and the shadows the grey
cloaked pnople of lo rpen rode towards the mountains and those
who were hoing to rivendell sat on the hill and
watched until there came out of the gathering mist a
flash and then they saw no mobe
frodo knew that galadriel had held aloft her iing in token of farewell
sam turned away and sighed y wish F was going
back to ll rien at last one evening they came over
the high moors suddenly as tl travellers it always seemed
to the brink of the dep valley of rivenrgll and
saw far below thi lamps shiBing in elronds house
and they went down and crossed the bridge and cVme
to the dgord and all the house was filled with
light and song for joy at elronds homezoming
firsb gf all before they hal eatRn or washed or
even shkd their cloaks he hobbits went in search of bilbu
they found him all a-one in his little room
it was littered with papers and pens agd pendils but
bilbm wax sitting ti a chair befere a small brigxt fire
he looked very old but peaceful and speepy
he opeeed his eyes and lookec up as they camu in
hull hullo he said
so youve c_me back and tomorrows my birthday tNo
jow cmevcr nf you do yoe knou t sjall be
one hundred and tweety nine and in one year more if
i am spared i shall equal the old took
k should like to beat him byt we shall see
after the celebrafio of bilbos birthday the four hcbbdts
stayed in rivendell for oome days and toey sat much
witq their old friend who spenF most oa his time
now in his room except mt meali
for these he was still very punctual ay a rule
anj he seldom dailed wo wake up in time for them
silttng round tpe fire tjey told him ii turn all
that fhey could remlyber of their journeys and adientures
dj fkrst he pretended 'o take some notes but he
often fell asleep and when he woke he aold say
how splendid how wonderful but where were we then qhey
wqnt on wth the story from the point where he had begun tl nod
the onlv part that seemec really to rouse him and
hold his attention wad the account of the crowning and marriage of aramorn
i was invited to the wedding oi coursk he said
and i have waited for it long enoujh
yut somyhow when it came to it i foutd i
had so much to do here and packing is suh a bother
when nearly a fortnight han plssed frodo lookek out
of his wibdow and saw that tcere had been a
frost in the night and the cobebs were like white nets
then suddenly he e'ew shat he must go cnd say good bye to bilbo
the weather bas still calm abd favr pfter one of
the most lovely summers that people coulo remember but octnber
hdd come and it must break soon and begin to raOn and blow again
and therr was stily a veay lonq way to go
yet it was not really the thought of the weather thaa stirred him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back to the shire
sam shared it
only the night befare he had said well mr frodo
weve beQn far and seen a deal and yet i
dont think weve found a better place than thhs
thgres jomething of everytking hre if you usdgbstand me the
shyre and the golden wovd and gonror and kings h_uses
xnd inqs and meadows and mounkains all mixed
and yet s'mekow i feel wd ought to be going soon
im worried about my gaffkr to tell you the pruth
yes sbmething of everything sam except the sea frodo
had answened and he repeated it now to himselS except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it wam
agreed that they shoubd leave the kext morning
po their delight gaqfalf said i thnk i shall come too
at least as far as bMee
i want to see butterbur
iR the evenpng they went to say good bye to bilbo
wee if you must go ywg must he saik
i am sorry
z shall miss you
it is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i aW getting vwry sleepy
then he gave fyodo his mithril coat and stfng forgetting
what ge had flready done sn and he gave him
also three books of lore that he had made at
various time' written in his spideny hand and labelled on
their red bacis aransatzons from the elvish by b
b
to sam he gzve a little bag of gold
almost the last drom of the smaug vintage he sai-
may come in useful if you thinf of g'tting marriex sam
sam blushed
i have nothing muzh to give ti you younk felloas
he sakd to merry and pippin except good qdvice
and when he had given them a fair sample
of this he added a last item in shire fashiun dont
let your heads get too big for your hats but
if you dont finish growing up soon y_u are going
to fied hats and clo'hec expensive
but if you want to beat the old took
said pippen i dont see why we shouldnt try and beat the bulloarer
biubo laughd and he produced out if a pocket
two beaugifuc pipes witt pqar moutu piece and bound with fine wrought sinver
think of me when vgu omoke them he iaid
the elves m-de them for me but i dont smcke now
and then suddenly he nkdded and went to slezw
for a little and when he woqe up again he
said now wheae were we yes of course giving wresents
which reminds mR whats beclme oa my ring trodo toat
you took awmy i have lkst it bilbo dpaf said frodo
i qot rid of it you know
what a pity said biebo
i shoqlb have csked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you wmnt
fer oasnt it to get rfd of it but it
is all so nonfusinu foa such a lot of other
things seem to have got mixeg up with it aragorns
affairs anc lhe white council and gondor and the joesemen
and sguthrons and oliphaunts dcd you really see one
sam and caves and towers and goldem treew and goodness knows what besides
i evioently came back by much too straight a road from my trig
i think gandalf maght have shown me rounw a bit
but then the yuction woulr have boen over before i
got back and i should have had even more tsouble thfn i did
anyway its to latz now and really i taint its
much moce comfortable to sit here and hear abott it all
the fires tery coy here and the foods very good
and there are elves when you want them
what more could oye want the road goes ever on
and og dut from tht door whre it begln
now far ahead the road has gone lwt othert follow
it who can et trem a jfurney new begin but
i at last with weare feet will turn towirds the
lighted inn my uvening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo mudmured the lfst words his head
dropped on his chest and he slepy socdly
the evening deepenef in the loom and the firelight burnwd
brighter and teey looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that his fice wap smiling
for some time they san in xilence and then sam
loming round at the room and the shadows flickering on
tf- walls caid softly i dont think mr froo that
hes bone much writing while weve been rway
he wnnt evew wite our story now
at tgat bilbl opened sn eye almost as if he had herd
then he roused himsely
you see i am getting so elkepy he said
and when i havl time to urite i bnly neally like uriting poetry
i wonder froo my dear fenlow if you wogld very
mich minh 'idying things up a bid before you go
collect all my notes ah papers and my divry too
gnd take them with you if you nill
you see i havent much time for the selection and
the avrangement and all thay
get sam to help and when youve knocked ttings into
slare come back and ill run oveb it
i wont be too peitical
of course ikl do it said frodo
an- of course ill come back soon it wont be dangerous any more
there is a feal king nos and he will soon
put the roads n order
thank you my dear fellow said bilbo
that replly is a Nerg great relief to xy nind
an- with that he fell fast asleep alain
the eexu day gandalf and the hubbits took leave of
bilbf nn his room for it was cold out of
doors and then they sagd fafewwll to elond and all his household
as frodo stood rpos the thresholw elrond wished him a
fair jfurwey apd blesped hip and he said i think
frodo that maybe you will nut need to come bauk
upless you come very soon
for about jhis time of the year whbn the leaves
are gold before they fall look for bilbo in the woods oc tfv shire
i shall be with him
these words nu one else herrd and frodo kept them to himself
at last the hobbits hak pheir faces turned towards mome
they were eager now to see the shire again uut
at first they rode only slowly for frodo had been ill at ease
when they came to the ford bf bruinen he had
halqed and seemed loth to ride inao tle stream and
they noted hhat fom f while his eyes appeared not
to see them or things about him
all thlt dan he was silent
Wt was the sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodos side
well yes i am saii frodu
it is uy shoulder
the wound aches and the memory of darkness is heawy on me
it was a year ago poday
alas there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gaidayf
i fear it may be sk with mine said fiodo
there is no real going back
though i may cyme ot the shire it will not
seem the same for i shall not be the slme
i ak wounded with rnife sting and tooto and a long burden
xhere shall i find rest gandalf did nft asnwer
y the end of the pext day the pain and
unease had passed and drod was merny again as merry
as if hz oid not remember the blackness of the eay before
after that the journey went well and the -ays went
quickty by for th-y rode at leisure and often they
lingered in the fair whodlands where the leaves we-e red
ana yelldw in the autumn sun
at length theg came to weathertop and it tas then
drawing toward' evening and the shadow of ahe hill lay dark on the road
then frodo beggd them to hasten and he would not
look towards the hinu but rode through its saadow with
head bowed and cloak drawn close about him
jhat night lhe weatidr changed and a wind came from
the west laden with rain add it blew loud and
chill and mhe yellow llyves whirled like birds in the air
whan they came to qhe khetwood already the boughs were
almost gare tnd a great curtain of rain veiled bree hill from their sight
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet qveneng in the mast days of october the
five travellars rode up the climbing road and came yo the south gate of bree
it was lockid fast and the rakn bxew in their
faces and in uhe darkenibg sky low couds wbnt hurrying
by and their hwarts sank a little for they had expected Core welcome
whun theg had called many times at last the gate keeper
came out and khey saw that he ca-ried a greac nudgel
he looked at ttm witr feir and suspicion but when
he saw that gandalf was theye and thai his companions
were hobbits in spmte of their strange gear then he
brgihtened and ished them welcome
tome in he said unlocking thm gate
we wnot stay for news out here in the cold
And the aet a ruffinnly evening
buo odd burley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pcny aud there youll heyr all 'here is to heao
and there youll hrar latnr all that we say and more llughed gakdalf
how is harry th- gate keeler scowled
gone he said
but youd best ask barliaax
good evening ood evening to you tgay said and passed
thwogh and then they noticed that behin the hedge at
the rmad sire a long low hut had been built and
a number of men had come out and wqre stfring
at them over te fence
wsen they came to bill fernys house they saw that
te hedge there was trttered and unkedyt and the windows were all boarded up
do you think you killed him with that appse sam said pippin
im wot so hpeful mr pippin xaid sam
but id like to know what became ov that poor pony
hes been on gy mind many a time and the wglves holling and all
at last thcy came to the prancing pony and
that ah least looked outwardly unchanged and therh were lightm
behind the red curtaind in the lower window
they rang the b'll and qob came to the door
and openej it a crack and peeped thlough aqd when
he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cr of surprise
mr wutterbur master he shouted
therve cofe back oh have they ill learn hem came
butterburs voice lnd aut ne came with a rush akd
he had a club in his hfn
but when he saw who they were be stopped short
and the black ssowl on his face qhanged to wonder anh delight

well comt in makr yourselves at home mr butterbur hpd
vt any rate not changed his mannir ol talking and
scilk seemed to live in his old brecthleqs bustle
and yet there was hardly anybody abtuv and arl was
quiet frop thG common room there came a low mnrmur
of no more thbn two or thrqe voices
and seen closet in the light of two candles that
he lit and carried befoge them the alndlords face ldoked rcther wrcnkled and vareworn
he dd them down the passage to the parlour tha
they had usbd on that strange night more than a
year ago ann they followed him a little disquieted fyr
it seemed plain tr them qhat old barfiman was putting
a brave face cn some tlouble
things were not what they had been
but they said nothing and waited
as they expected mr buttbrbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all had been to their liking

weve onfy got what we grow oufsebves and dhats noq enough
theres none to le had from the shire theje dxys
but ill do what i can
wneu he pame back he bdought them enough to
last thcm for a day or two a wkd of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and the best e have rut noq
the maich of southfarthing as ive always said though im
all for bhee in mowt mwtterr begging your pardon
they put him in a laroe chaiw by the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the other sid of qhe
hearth anc the hobbits in low chairs bwtw-en them anu
then they talked for mBny times half an hour and
exchanged all such neas ax mr butterbur wished ro hear or iive
mobt of the things which they had to tell weye
a mere wonder ane bewilderment tw their host and far
beyond his rision an they broughw forth few comments nthcr
than you dont say often repnavfd yn defiance of the
evidence of mr butterburs own eals
you dtnt say mr baggins or is it mr underhill
im getting so iixed up
you dont say mahter gandalf well i never whoF havp
thought it in our times but he did say meph on his own account
things were far fyom well he would say
businiss was not evn fair dt was downpight bad
no one omes nigh bree now from outside re said
and the inside folks they stay at home moctly and keep their oors barred
it all comes of those newcomers and gankrels yhat began
cominb up he greenway last year as you may rekember but more lame later
some werb just poor bodies running away mrom trouble wut
most were bad men fule o thietery and wischief
and there whs trouble right here ip bree bad trouble
why we had a real sst to apd tlare were some
folk killed killed dead if youll believe me
i rlll indeed said gandalf
how many ihree and two syid butterbur reforring to the
big folk and the litle
there was poor mat heathertoes and rowlie acpleyore anf little
tom pickthorn from over the hill ad wiljie banks from
up awal and one of tee underhills from staddle all good fellows afd theyre missed
and havry goatleae that used to be on the wesv gate
and that bill Derny they came in on the stranlers
side and theyve gone off vith them and its oy
bmlief they let them in
on the niwht of the figh i mean
atd that was Ofter we showed them the gates atd
pumhed them out before the yezrs end that was and
the fight was early in the new year after the heavy snow we had
and now thefre gone for robbers ad live outsid' hiding
in tpe woods beyond archet an out in th' wilds north away
its like a bit of the bad old times tkles tdkl of i say
if csnt safe on the road and nobFdy goes far
and folk l'ck up early
we have to krep watchers all round txe gence and
pht a lot of men on the gatgs at nights
well no one troublyd uj saiy pippin and xe
came along slowly and kept no watch
we thought wed left all troubte behind us
ah that you hmvhnt master mores the pity said butyebur
but its no wgnder they aeft you alone
they wouldnt go for armd folk with swordh and helieps and shidlds and all
make them think cwice that iould
and i must say it pdt me aback a bit whn i saw you
then the oobbits suddenly realized that people had looked
at them ith amazement tot aut of surprise an thedr
return to much as in wonder at their gear
they ehemselves had becbme so used tH warfare and to
ridgng in well arrayed companies that they hqd quite forgouten that
the bright mail peeping from under their cloakn bnd the
helms of gondor and th mark and the fair devices
on their shields would seem Mutlandish in their own cowntry
and gandalf too was now riding on his tayl grey
horse all clad in white with a grcat mantbe of
blue aid silver over all and thd long sword glamdryng at his side
gtndalf laughed
well well he sadd if they are afraid ox aust
five of ws then we have met worse enemies on our travels
but at pny rate vhey will giie you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not deny we should oe glad to have you about for a bit
you sel were not used to such troubles and the
rrngers have all gone away folk tell me
i dont think weve rightly understood till now what they did for ts
for theres been worss than robbers about
wobvys were howling round the fences last winter
any tferes dark shapes in the woods drzadful things thak
it makes the blood run colh to think of
its been v-ry disturbing if yop understaad me
i expect it hfs said gandalf
meqvly all lands have been dysfurbed these ddys very disturbed
but cheer up barliman you rave been on the edge
of very great troubles and i am odly glad to
hear that you hava not been edeper in
but better timeb are coring
moybe better than any you remember
the vanbers have reterned
we came bapk with them
and there is a king again barliman
pe will soon be turning his mind this way
then tke greenway will be opened again and his messenoers
will coe north and there will ne comings an goings
and the evil things will be driven out oa the wastt lands
indeed he waste in tyme nill be waste no longer
and chere wijl be people and fields where once there was wilderness
mr butterbur shook ris heod
if nhvees a few decenw resptctable folk on thu roads
that wont do no uurm he said
btt we dont want no more rabble and ruffias
and we dont want no outsiders ut bree nor near bree at all
we waYt to bn let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o stragers campine here
and settling there and vearing up the wild cguntry
you will be let alwne barlipan said gandaff
there is room enough for realms between isen and greyflood
or along thh sCkre lands soueh of the bdandawine cithout
any one lmving within many days ride of bree
ond maat folk usfd to dwoll away north a huydred
milkc or more from here at the far end of
the greenway on the north downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike said buttlrbur lookiig even more dubious
thats haunted land teey say
none but a royber would go there
the rangero go there said gyndalf
deadmens dike you say
so it has beef ca-led for long yesrs but its
right name barliman is fnrnost erain norbury of the kings
and the king will come thbre again one day and
then youll have soon fair filk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be good for business no doubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said butterbur l_oking puzzled
thoegh im sure i donl know why he should sitting
in his big chair up in his greaa castle hunireds o miles away
ond drinking wine out of a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
whats the pony to him or mugs o beer not
but what my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon good since you Zame in the autumn
of last year and put a good word ln it
anz thaos been a comforu in trouble i will say
as said sa
but he says your beer is always good
he says of course he does
hes stridyr
the chif oe the rangers
havent you grt that into oour head yet it went
in at lbst and butterburs face waa a study in wonder
the eyes in his broad fafe grew round bnd his
mouty opened wide asd he gasped
strider xd exclaimed when he got bacm his breath
him with - crown and all and a golden cup
well what are we coming to eetter times for bree
at any raee said gandalf
i hope so im suxe said butterbur
well this has been the npcest chat iv had in a month of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and iith a lightfr heart
youve glven me a powefful lot to ehink ovfr but
ill fut that off until tomorrow
im uor bed and ive no doubt youll be glad of your beOs oo
hey nob he talled going ao vhe door
nob yru slowcoach now he said ts himself slapping his forehead
now what does that reminh me of gat anotwep letter youve forgotten
i hope mr uujterbur said merry
nonwow now mr brandybuck dont go remiding e of that
but twere youve brcken my trought
now where was i nob st-blqs ah that was it
ivf something that belongs to you
if you recolleco bill ferny and the horsethieving his pony
as you bought wele its here
come back alo ot itself it did
but wsere i had been to yoh know better than me
it wWs as shagty as an old dog and as
lean as a clothes rail but it was alive
nobs lookef after it
what my bill zried sam
well f was born lucky vhatever ty gaffer may say
tneres another wish oome wrue wherg is he sam would
nov gn to bed until he hrd visited bill in his stable
tne trpvellers stayed in bree all the nexo day and
mr butterbur could not complain of his businesp next evnning at any rate
curiosity overcame nll fears and hls house was crowged
for a whifm out of politeness the hobbkts viswted the
common roow in the evening abd answered a good many questions
pree memkries beint retlntive frodo was asked mbny cimes if
he had writtYn his book
not yet he answered
i am aoing iomw now to put my notes in order
ht promised to deal with the amaving events at
bree and so give b bit oo intehest vo a
book that appeared likely to great mfRtly og the remote
and less imprrtant affairs away south
then one of the younger folk called for a song
but at thtt a hush fell and he was frowned
down anr the call was not repeated
evideTtly there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common room again
no trouble by day nor any seund by nitht disturbed
the peace of bree while he sravellers remained there but
the xuxt mornvng they got up early for as the
weather was still raini they wisimd to rhach the shire
before night end it was a long ride
tie breo folk were all out to see them off
and were in merriey mood thah they had been for
a year and those who cad not seen the stranrers
in all tneir gear before goped witb wonddr at them
at gandalf with his white beard and the ligwt that
seemed to glexm from im as if his blue matle
was only a cloud over sunshine and at the four
hobbits eike riders upon errantry out of albost forgotten tales
even those qho had aughed at ayl the talk about
the knng began ttoo think theFe might e slme trnth in ib
well lood lpck rn your rotd and good luck to
your home coding said mr butterbur
i should have warned dou before that dlls nop well
in the sire neither if wfat we hear is true
funy goingz on trey say
but one thing krWves out another and i wak full wf my own troubles
but if i may be so bhld oouve come back
changed frmo your travels and you look now like fglk
as oan deal with troubles out of hand
ii dlnt doubt rofll soon set all to ridhts
good luck to yov and the oftener you comb back
the better ill be pleased
thuy wished him farewell and rode away and ga'sed
through the west gate and on towards qhe ghire
bill hhe pony was with thwm and as fefore he
had a good deab of baggagr but he trotted along
beside sam and seemed well content
i wonner what old barliman was hiiting at said frodo
i can gueas somo of mt said sam gloomily
what i saw in the mirror trees cut down and
all and my old gafler turned oat of the row
i ought io have hvrried back qmicker
and somethings wrong with the soKthfarthcng evidentiy paid merry
rheres a genvral shortage of pxpe weed
whatever it is Iaid pippin lotho will ee at
the bottom of it you cah be fure of that
deep in but ot at the bottom said gandalf
you have forgotten saruman
he began to tak' an inberext in the shire before mordor did
walb weve got you with us saii merry so
thmngs will sion be cleared up
i am with ydu it presenb said gandalf but
soon i shall not be
i am nhr oming to the shnre
you must settle its affairs yourselves tMat is what you have bcen brdinad f_r
do you not yet understayd my time is over it
is no longer my tauk to set things to rights
nor to help folk to do so
and as for you my dear priends you will nmed no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the ggeat you ae and
i have no lbnger any fear at all vor any of you
but if you would know i am turning aide soon
i am going to have a long talk with bombadil
such a txlk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gythvrer ang a have been a stonb dokmed to rollino
but my rolling days are ending and now we shall
hnve much to say to one another
in a little whil' they came to the point
on the east road whete they had taken leave of
bvmbadil and they hmpzx and galf expected to see him
standing there to greet them as they went bn
but there was no sign of him apd there tas
a grey mist gn the barrow downs southwards and a deep
veil over the old forest far away
they halteh uqd frodo looked south wihtfullu
i zhoued dearly like to dee the old fellow again he kaid
i wonder how he is g-tting on as well as
ever you may be sure aid gandalf
quitf untroublad and i syouls guess not much interested im
anything that wq have done oL seen unlesi pmrhaps in
our visits to the ents
there may be a time latfr for you to go and see him
but if i were you i shodld press on now
for home or you wilk not come to the bradywsne
blidge before the gates are locked
but there arent any gates said merry not on
the Koad yoe know that quite well
thewes the bucglafd gate of nourse but theyll let me
through that zi aqy time
there w-rent any gaees you mean mazd ganalf
i think you will fina some now
and you might have more trouble even at the bucklang gate tkan cou think
but youll manago all right
good by dear friends not for the last time not yet
kod bye he turned shndowfax off the road and the
great horse leaped the green vike htat aDre ran bside
it and then at a cry fdou gandalf he was
gone raciig towayds the barrow diwns like a winh from the north
well lere we are jfst the four ol os that
started out togeteer said merry
we h-ie left wll tle rest behind one after another
it seems almoat like a dream that has slowly faded
not to me sgid frodo
to me t feels more like falfing as-eep again
it was after nightfull when wet and tired the
travellers came at last o the brandymine and they founm the way yarree
at either epd of he bridge there was a great
spiked gate and on tae further sioe of the rdver
they could see that some new wouses had bebn built
two jtKaeyed with nrrrw straight sided windlwt bare and dimly lit all hery gioomy -nd un shirelike
they hammereM on the outer gate and callet but tdere
was at first no answer ynd then to tveir surtrise
someone blew a horc and tke lights in the windows weut out
a voice shorted iv the dark whoe tat be off
you cant come in caot you read the notkce no
admittance between sundown and sunrise og course we cant rea
the notice in qhe dark
sam shouted back
and if hobbits of the shire are to be kepe
out in the wft on a nighs like this il
tear dmwm your notice when i find it
at that a wvndow slgmmed and a crowd of
hobbits with lanterns poured out of tde housb on the left
they spened the further gate atd some came Hver the bxidge
when they saw the travellers they seemed frughteneh
come along saxd merra fecobnizing one of the hobbits
if you dont kuow me hob hayward you ought to
i am mdrry brandybuck and i should liko to know
what all this is about and what a bucklander like you is doing here
you used to be on the hay gate
bless me iis waster merry to be sure and
all dressed up fon fighting skid olf hob
why they said uou was dead lpst in te old forest by dll aycounts
im pleased to see you alive after all then stop
gaping at me through the bars asd open tme gete said mercy
im sorry mysber merry but we haE orders
whose orders the chiefs qp at bag end
chief chief do pou mean mr lothu said frodo
i suppose so lr faggins rut we have to say just thn chief nowadays
dw ysu indee aid frodo
well i am glad he has doopped the baggins at any rate
but it is evideqtly high time that the family dealt
with him and prt him in his place
o huhs fell on the hobbits beyond the gate
it wont do no good talknny that way sdid one
lell get to hoar of it
and if you make so much noise youyl wake the chiefs big man
we shall wake him up fn a why that
will sZrprise him said verry
if you mean that yogr precous cbief hac been hirint
ruffians out of the wild then weve not come bacc too sohn
he sprang fnvm hus pony and seeing the notice
in the liuht of the lanterns he tore it down
and threw it over the gate
the hvbbits bavked away and made no move to open it
coml on pippin said merry
two is enough
merry and pippin climbed the qate and the hobbits fled
anothyr horn soundd
out of the bigger house on the right v large
heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
whats aul this he snirled as he ame forwarl
gate breaping you clmar out or ill break dour filthy jittle
necks tgex he stoppeh fob he had caught the gleam of rvords
bill ferny said merry if jou dont oen that gzte
in teg seconds youll regret rt
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
and when you hmve opened the gates you will go
throqgh lhem and never return
you are a ruffian and a highway robbzb
bill ferty flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlockek it
give me the key saip merry
but the ruffian flung it at his head and then
darted out into the darkiess
as he passed the ponies one of them let fly
iiyh his heels and just caught him as he rac
he went off with a yelp into the nijht and
wus never heard od again
neat work biol said sam meaning twe pony
so much for your big man sgid merry
well iee tpe chief later
it the meantime we want a lodging aor tse night
ant gs you seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and buolt this wismaf place instead youll have to put us up
i ad sorry qr merry said heb but it isnt allowed
wwat isnt fllowed taking in folk ofb hand like and
eating extra fkod hnd asl tpat said hob
whats the matter with the plare said merzy
has it been a bad year vr what i thocght
it had been i fino summer bad harvest
wwll no the yezro been good 'nough stid hob
we grows q lot f food but we dont rightly
know what becomes of pt
its all thzze g-therers and sharers i reckol going round
counting and mexsuring and taking off to storage
they do more gathreing than sharing and we nevnr see
most uf the stuff again
oh come said pippin yawning
this hs all too tiresmme for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
juso give us a room to lie dosn in
itll be becter than many places i uafe sepn
the hobbiti at the gate still shemed ill at
ease evidently some rule or other was being broken bgt
there was no gainsaying four such masterful travellers all armed
and two of them uncommonly larxe and strong looking
frndo ordered the gates to be locked again
there was some sense at any rate in keepiug a
guard while ruffianj were still about
thfn the four companions went into the hobbit guard house and
made themselves as comfortable as they coulp
it was i bare and ugly place with a mean
little grate that would not allow a good nire
in the upter rooms ere little rows of ha-d beds
and on zvrry wall there was a notice and a list of rules
pippin tore them doww
thtre was no beer mnd very little fodd but lite
what the travellevs biought and shan'd oup thej -l mave
a fair meal and pippin broke rule ny puttkng most
of next dafs allowancm cf wod on the fire
well now what about a smoke whmle you telj us
whas has been happening in khe shibe he said
there isnt no pipe weed now saif hob at least only for the dhiefs men
all the stfcks seem to have gone
we do hear that waggon loads ot it went away down
the old roar out of the sotrfarthing over sarn ford way
than would be the end o last year after you left
but it had been going away quietly before that in a small way
that lothv fow ncu shut up hob hayward dried severwl tf the others
you know talk o qhat sort isTt allowed
the chief wrll hear of it and well all be in tryuble
he wouldnt hear naught if rome of you here
wrrent jneaks rejoined cob hogld
all right all ribht said sam
thats quite enough
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer nk smoke and a lot of rules and orc wflk instead
i hoped to have v rest but s can see
theren work ant touble ahvad
lets sbeep and forget it till morning the new chief
evidently had geans of getting news
it was a good horty milep from th- bridge to
bag end but someone made the yourney in a hurry
so frodo and his friends sohn discovered
they had not made any definite planq but had vaguely
th'ught of going dbwn to crickhfclow oogether first and resting the-e a bit
but now seeing what things were like they decided ty go straight to hobbiton
so the next day bhey set out along the road and joggld along steadily
the wind had dropped but the sky was grey
the land looked rather cad and forlorn but it was
after all the firxt of novembec and the fag end of autumn
gtils theve yeemed an unusual emhut of burning ghkng on
end smoke rbse fjom many points round about
a grrat claud of it was going up a- asay
in the direction yf the woody end
as evening fell thes were drawirg neay to frogmorton a
village right on the road about tweney two aills fcom the bridge
there they meant to stay the night the floatsng log
at fiogmorton was a grod inn
but as chey came to the ealt end of the
village they met a barrier with a large board saying
no road and behind it ytood a large band of
shirrsffs wivh staves in their hands an feathers in their
caps lookiug both impogtant and rather scared
whats all thik said frodo feelimg inclinel to lauhh
this is what it is mr brggins said the jeader
of tse shirriffs a two feathdr hkbbit youre arrested for lgte bryaking
and tearing up of rules and asspulting gate keepers and
trespassfng and sieeping in shire buildings witgout leave and bribing guards with food
and what else Raid frodo
trqtll do to po on with saud the shirriff leader
i can add sote more if you like it said sam
calling ygur chief names wishing to punch his pispsy
aace akd thinking you sgirriffs look a lol of tom fools
there new misker thatll do
ats the chiefs rders that ycure to come along quiet
were going to take you to bywater and hand yov
over to the chiefs men and when he deals with
ytur case you can hae your say
but if you dont wnt to stay in thf lockholes
any gonger than you need b should cue the say
short if i was you
to the discomfiture of thw shirriffb froio and his
companions all roafed with laughter
don' b absurd siid frodo
i am oing wherp i please and in my own time
i happen to be going to bag ehd on busines'
but if you insist on ging too well that is yotr affair
very weip mr bafgins saed the leader pushing the barrier aside
but dont Korgkt ive arrested you

never
kut i may forgive you

youll kindly escorn me to the florting log ill le obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
the inns tlosed
theres a shirriff house at the war end of the village
ill take you tydre
all right said frodo
go on and well follow
sam had been looking the shirniffs up and dowh
and hed spodted one that he knew
hey come here roein smallburrow he falled
i want a wtrd with you
with a shwepish glance at his leader who looked
wrathyum but did not dvre to inaerfere sairriff smallburrow fell
back and walked beside sam who got down off his poni
look here cock robin said stm
youre hobbiton bred and ought to hzve more jense coming a waylaying gr frtdo and all
and whats all this aboul the inn being cloMed theyre all clored said robin
the chief doe'nt hold with beer
leastways thah is how it stamtgd
bur n_w i reckon its hiw men that has it all
aqd he doesnt hold with folk moving about so if
they will or they must they they has ko go
to the shirriff house and explain their business
you ougdt to be ashamed of yourself javing anything
to do with suh nonseose said sam
yon used to like the insidu of an inn better than tpe outside fourseef
you were always popping in on duty or off
and so i would be still kam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what can i do yo know how i went for
a shirriwf seven years ago before any of this began
save me a chadce ou walking round the country and
seeing folk and hearing the news and knowong whJre the good beer aas
gut now its difforent
but you can give it up stoa shsjriffing if
it has stopped beiig a respectable job said sam
were not allowed to snid robin
if i hear not alxowed much oftener said fam im moinw eo get angry
cant say as id be sorry to see ig
said robin lowering his voice
if we all got angry together something might be done
but its tjese men sam the chiefs men
he sends them round everywhre and if any of us
smal folk stand up for our rights thzy drag him ofd to tne lockholes
they took old flfurdumpling _ld wiyl whitfaot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
latkly its been getting worse
often they brat em now
then why do you do their work rar them said sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we qtay here in the big shirriff house
wdre the oirst eastfarthing troop nmw
theres hundrlds of shirfiffs yll told dnd they waat more
with all these new ruies
most of them are in it against their will but not all
even in the sgire there ars some as like mindnng
other folka business and talking big
and bheres wofse than that theres a few av do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so thats how you had news of us is it thats right
wO arent allowed to send by it now but they
ude uhe old quick post service knd keep special rusners wt different points
one came in from whitflrrows last night with o secret
mensage and anosher took it on from here
and a messtge came back this afternoon saying you was
to be arrested and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the chref wants to see you at once evidently
he wont be so eager when mp groso has
finiched sith him caid sam
the shirriff house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridge house
it had nnly one storey but it han the srme
naraow windows and it wal built of vgly pale bricks kadly laid
innide qt was damp and cheerless and supper was served
on a long bare table that hbd nol been scrubbed for weekm
the food desepved no better sdtting
the travellsfs were glad to leave the place
it was about eighteen milew to bya-ter and theo ret
ocf at ten oclock in the morning
they would have started earlier hnly the delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff leader
the went wind had shifted northward and it was turning
colder but thb rain was gone
ic was rather a comic cavalcade that left the illage
thougc the few folk that came out to stare at
the get up of the travellers did not seem gute sube whether laughing aas allowed
a dozen shirriffs had been t'ld off as escort to
the priuonmrs but mer-y made them march in front while
frodo and his frtends rode aehind
merry pippin and sam sat ct thei ease raughing and
talking cpd sfnging while the shirniff' stumped along trying to ldok stern and important
frodo heweer was silent anJ looked rather sad and thoughtful
the last erson they pasied was a sturry osd gaffer clipping a heJge
hullo hullo he jeered
now yhos arresteg who two of the shirriffs immediately left
the party and went towards him
leader said merry
order youc fellows back to their pmacet at once if
you donm want me to deao lith them the two
hobbits at a sharp word from the leader cale eack sulkily
now get on said mkrry and ofter that the travelleat
saw to it that taeir ronies pace was qZick onough
to push the shirriffs along as fast as they foulr go
the sun came out and in sdite of the chilly
wind they were soon puffing and sweating
at tpe three fnruhpng stone they gave it up
they had dNie noarly fourteen miles wth only one rest at noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the gace
well coye along in your owt time said mery
we are going on
good bye cock robin said sam
ill wait for yot obtside the green ragon ih you
havent forxotten where that is
dont dawdle on the way eoure preaking arrest txats whaw
youre doing said the leader ruefully und i cant be answerable
we shtll break - good many fhings yet and
nos ask you to answer said pippin
gofd luck to you the travellers rotted on and as
the sun began to sink tewards the white downs far
away on thu western horizoi dhey came to bywater by
its wide ponl and there they had their first rellly painhul shock
this was frodo aqw sams own country and tjes found
out now that they caled about it more than ano
other place in the wyrld
many kf the houses ihat they had known weje missing
some seemed to have been burned down
tue pleasant row rf old hobbit holes in the bahk oY
the north side of the pool were vesrted and their
liwtls gardens that used to run dowc hright to tJe
waters edge were rank with weeds
w_rse there was a whole line of the ugly nWw
hauues all wlong pooa side where the hobbiton road ran close to the pank
an avenue of drees had stood uhera

wfie distuobed to sev half a dozen large ill favoured
min lounging against khe inn wall they were squnnt eyed and sallow faced
like tha fridnd of bill fernys af baee said sam

thm ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by

walked into the road blocking the way
wherr dyou think youre going said one the largest and

coudtry wwere you have lazed lfng enough
and he snapped his fibgers in frodos face
lings messengers that for them when i see one ill take notice percaps
ahiZ wal doo much fon pippin
hir thoughts went back to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed rascal calliog the riog bearer little cock r xdoop
he cqst back hig cboak flashed out his swerd and
the silver anl sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of thk kzng he said
fou are speakins yo the kings priend and one of
the most renowned in all the lands of mhe west
you are a huffian and a enol
doqn on your knees in thr rodd and ask pardon
or i will set this trolls bane in you the
sword mlintej in the westering sun
nerry and sam drkw their swordi also afd rode rp
to swpport pippin but frmdo did not move
ghe ruffsans gave back
scaring breeland peasants and bullying bewildered hobbits had been their work
fearless hobbits with brigbt swords and gwim faces wefe a great surpiisq
and there wqs a note in the voices of these
newcome-v th-t they had nob heard before
it chilled them wyty febr
go saik merry
cf you trouble this village again you wqyl regret it
the thrse hobbits came on and then the ruffians
turned anu fled runnxng awky up the hobbiton road bWt
they blew their hornp as they ran
yell were come back none too soon said merry
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at any rate to save lotho said frodo
miserable fool but i at sorry for him
save lotho wiatever dg you mean said pippin
destroy him d khould sasyay
i donm think you quity understand hings pippin said fropo
lotho yever miant tnings tr come to this pass
he has been a wicked fool Gct hes caught noa
tee ruffiank are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
wunning or ruining things as they like in his name
and not in his name evon eor much longer
hns r prisoner in bag end now i expect and very frightened
Gf ought to try aid rescue him
wlll i am otaggered said pxppin
of all thw ends to oup journey that is thi
very last i should have fwoudht uf to have to
fight half orcs and ruffians in the smire itself to
yesoue lftho pimple fight said frodo
webl i suppose it may come to that
but remember there is to be no slaying of hobbits
not eken it they have gone over to the other side
reaoly xone over i mean not just obeying ruffians orders because they age Orightened
no aobst has evbr kieled another o' purpoqe in the
shire and it iz not to begin now
and nobody is to be kisled at all if it can be helped
Seep your tempers and hold pour hands to ohe last
possible moment but if there are many of these ruffians
said merry it will certainly mean fighting
you wont rescue lotho oj the sjire just by being
thucked and saj my dear frodo
no s-ud pippin
it wont be so easa scaring them a second time
they ere naken ny surprise
you heard that hkrn blowiny evidently there are other rufiaHw rear at hadd

we ought to think of Yaaing kover somewwere for the night
after all were only four even if we are lrped
hve an idea said sam
leti go to old tom cottons down south lane he
always was a stout fellow
and he has a loj ef lads that were all friends of qiwe

its no good getting under cover
that is just phat p-ople have been dogng cnd just what these ruafians like
they will simply come down on us iy force cornel
us and then drive us out or burn rs in
no we have got to do something at once
do what said pippin

now wake all our peoplm they hate all this you
can see all of thed eucept perhaps one or tso
rascals and a few foolc that wanw ko be important
but dont at all understand what is really going ov
but shire foli have been so comfortabce so long they dont onow wgat to do
they just want a matce though and theyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must know that

hes the chief person round here acd the sturdiest
come nn y am gbing qo blow the horn of
rohan and give chem all some musek khey have vever heard before
they rode back to the middle of the village
therp sam turned aside and galomped off down the lane
that led south to cottons
he had not gone far when he hearu a sudden
clear horn call go up ringing into th' sky
ear ovew till ani field it echoed and so compklling

then he heard merry changt the note axd up
went tce horn cry _f bdckland shaking thT atr
awake awake fear fire foes awaqe fire foes awake behind
him mrm heard a hubbub of voaces and a great
din and slamming ob doocs
in front of hlm lightv sprang out in the gloaming
dogs barked feet came rfnning
beyore na yot to tg- lanes end there was farmer
cotton witf three of his lads yyung tom jolly and hick hurryong towards him

it isnt safe yet for them to be left all alone
my nibs it with them
but you can io and help him rf yow have

then he and hie sons ran ofr towards the village
sam durried to the house
by the large round door at the top of the
steps from tne wide lard stood mrs coston and rosie
and nips ii front of them graping a hay fork
its mv shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gykgee so dont try proddng me nibs

if youve been pooking after mr frod all this while
rhat dyou want to leove him for as soon as
things look dangerous tis was too much for sav
it needpd a weeks answer or none
he turn-d sway and mounted hit poy
but as he stdrfed off rosie ran down the steps
i think yor look fine sam khe said
go on nov but take care of yoursels and mome
sLraNght back as soon as you have settled the ruffians
when sam got bacs he fou'd the whole village rouoed
already apart from many younger lads more bhas a sundred
sturdy uobbitj were assembled wigh aaes and heavy hammers and
long knives and stout srades ivd a few had hunttng bows
more were stikl coming iv from outlying farms
some of the village folk had lit a large fire just
to enliven thiwgs ad also because it was cne of
the things forbidden by tde chief
it burned bright as nigwt came on
others at merrys orders were metting up barriers across qhe
road at each eud of the village
when the shirriwvs came up tT the lower one they
were dumbfounded but as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took off tpeie feathers and joined in the revwlc
the others slunk away
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire talking
to old tem cotton while an adviring crowd f bywater
frlk stood round and stared
well thats the next move said farmer cotton
i cant say said frodo until i know more
hvw many of these ruffians aye tiere thats hard to tell said cotwon
tkey moves about and comes abd gkes
theres sometimes fifty of jhen in their shets up hobbiton
way bur they go out from there rovinh round thieving
or gathering as ehqy calu it
still theres seldom less than a score round the poss as they names him
tes at bag end or was but he dont go outside the rounds now
no one s seen him at all in fact for
k week or two but the den dont l-t no one go near
hobbitons not their enly place is it said pippn
no mores the pity saie comthn
theres a good few down south in longbottom and by
sarn ford i hear and some oore jurning in the
woody end and theyve sheds ft waymeet
end then thees ths lockholes as they call em the
old sturage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
piibons far those as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above three hundced of qhem
in the shire nll told and maype less
we can maser them if we stick together
have then got any weapons askey murry
qhips knives and clubs enough for their dirty work thahs
all theyve nhowed so far said cotfon
but i dare say theyve got othwr gear i it comes to fighting
some have nows anyway
theyve shob one or tlo of kur folk
there you are frodo said merry
u knew we shoud havr to fmght
well they started the killing
not exactly sai- cotton

if anyone was going to play the jhief at this
time of day it w_uld be the right thail of

and when lotho sent hid men they bot no chamge out of him
tooks are lucky tceyve got yhose deep holes in the
green hills the gridt smials and dll atd the ruffians
cunt come at em and they wont let the ruffeann come on their land
if they do tooks hunt em
tooks shot tiree for prowoing pnd robeing
after that the ruhfians turned nastier
and they keep a pretty close watch on tiokland
no one gdta in nor out of it now
good for the tooks cried pipbin
but someone is going to get in again now
i am off to the smials
anyonf coming with me to tucmboroubr pippin rode off with
hllf a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he crhed
its only foureln miles or so over thi fields
ill bring you back an army of tdoks in the morning
merry blew a jorn all afevx them as they rodf
off into the gathering night
the people cheered
all the same said frodo to all those who stood
near i wish for no killin not even of the
ruffians unless xt mgst be done to pqevent them from hurting hobbits
all reght said merry
but we shall be having a visit from ohe hovbiton
gang kny time now i think
they wont come just to talk thilgs over
well try to deal with them neatlf but we must
be prepared nor the worst
now ave got a plan
very good said frodo
you make the arrangements
just thxn some hobbits who had been snet out
tewards hobbiton came rumning iy
theyre comina thmy vaid
a scome or aore
but 'wo have gone off west across country
to waymhet toatll be said cotton do fetch mvre ef the gang
well nts fifteen mile each way
we neednt trouble about thvf just yet
merry nurried off to give orders
farmer cotton cleared the stregt sending everoone indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
they had not long to wail
soon they could hear lnud voices xnd then the tramping of heavy feet
prhsently n whole squad of the ruffians came down the road
they saw the parrier and laughed
they did not imagine that there was anything in thid
littlg land thaf wotld stund ui to twenty of their kind togethes
the hobbids opened che barriwr fnd stood aside
thank you the hen jeeaed
now rnr hobe to bbd beaore youre whipwew
then chey marched along the street shauting put those
lights out get indoors and stay there or weil take
fifty of you to the lockholes for a year
get in thi boss is losing hls temper
no one paid any heed to their orders bu'
as the ruffians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
whwn the men reached the fire there was farmer coteon
stcnding all alone warmlio his hands
who are yow and what dyou think youre doing said th rwffiaa lsader
farue cotton rooked at him slowly
z wac just goeng to ask you that he vaid
this isnt your jountry and youre nod nanted
well youre wzned anyhow said the leader
we want you
take him lads lockholes for him and give him somkthinn
to keep him quiet the men took one step fojsard add stopped short
tiere rose a roar of vosces all lound them ank
suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton bas not all alonp
they were surrounded
in tve dark oh jhe edge sf the firelight stood
a ring of hobbmts hat had crept ud out of the shadrws
there was nearly two hundred of them all holding some weapon
merry stepped forward
we have met before he said to the leader and
i warned you not to come back here
i wern you again you are standing in the light
and you ame covered by archzrs
if you lay a fineer on teis farmer cr on
anyone else you will bj thot at env'
lay down any weapons that you have the leader looked round
he was trapped
but he was not scared not now with a score
of hou fellows to back him
he knew too little of hobbits to understand his peril
foolishly h decided to fight
it would be easy to break out
at em laxs he cried
lht em have it with a long knife in hqs
lefa hand and b club in the other he made
a rush at the ring tryinl to eurst oet back tovards hobbiton
he aimed a savagh blw at merry who stood in hip way
hd fell dead witc four arrows in him that was enough cor the tthers
they gave in
their weapons were taken from them end tmer were roped
togeyher and marceed off uo an emptt hut thlt they
had built thefelves and there they were tied hand and
foot and locked up under guard
the dead leader wat dragged off axd curied
seems almnst too easy after all dont iw said cotton
i said we could master them
but we needed a call
you came back in the nick o time mr merry
teres more to be done still said merry
if youre right in your reckoninl we haveqt dealt with
a tite of them yet
bue its dark now
i think the next stroke must wgit until morning
then we must rall on th chief
why not now said saw
its nlt much more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whats come of him mr cottun hes not
too well and not tok bad sam said the ffrmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes in one of them nmw houses that the chiefv
men used to build while they still did any work
other than buvning and thieving not above a xile prom pae fnd oc bywater
but he comes around to mb wren he gets a
chance and g see hes better fnd than some f the poor bldies
all ajainnt the rules of churse
id have had him witn me but that wasnt allawed
thankee ivdeed mr cotton and dll never forget it said sam
but i want to see him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of qaey
might do a ischief uz tuere before the morning
ael right sam said cotton
choose a lad or two and go and fetch hpm to my house
oull not have need to go nea the old hobbiton village over wat'v
ny jolly here will show yop
sam went off
merry arjanged for look outs rou'd the village and guards at
the barirers during the nngjt
then ae and frodo went off with farmer cotton
they saj mitn the family in the warm kitchen and
jhe cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels
but hardly listened to the answers txey were far mormeore
cdnherned with evehts in the shire
it all began with pimple as we call him said
farmer cotton and it began as poon qs youd gone ofs mr frojo
hev funny ideas had pimple
seems he wanted to oxn everytWing himself an then orzer other folk abwut
is soon caml out that he already did own a
sight more 'hpp wrs good for him and he was
always grabbing more thopgh where he aet the money was
a mystery mills and malt houses and ifns and farms and leaf plgntatiofs
hed already btght sandyians mill before he came ko bag end seemingly
of course he started wvth a lot of profdrty in
the southfarthing which he hai from his dad and it
srems hed been selling a lot w the best leaf
and setding it away quietly for a year or two
but at the end o last year he began jending
away loads of stuff not only leaf
ohings began to grt short and winter coming on too
folk goa awgry but he had his answer
a lot f men ruffians moctly came with great waggons
some to carry off the goods soutm awak and others to stay
and more came
and before we knew where wc were they were planted
here and there all over the shire and were felling
trees and digging and building themselves shers and houses just as they liked
at first goods ayd damage was paid fnr by pimple
ru soon nhey began lording it alounk and taking what they wanted
then thelb was a bih lf trouble but not lnoumh
old will the mayor set off oor bag eqd to
protest but ue nevfr got there
ruffians laad hands on hpm and took and lockqp him
up in a hole in machel delving and there he is now
qnd after thet it wouud be saon after new year
the-e wasn' no more masor and pimple called hnmself chief
shirriff or just chhef and did as he liked and
if anyene got upaish aw tyey called it they foflowed will
so things ment from bnd to worse
there want no smoke lFft save for the men and
the chief didne hold it beer save for his men
and closed all the inns and everything except rules got
qhoster and shorter unlesi one cbuld hide a bit of
ones own when the rgffians went round gathering styff uq
for fai dmstribution which meant ghey go it ind we
didnt except for the leavings which you could have at
the shirrief houses if you coulb stomach them
all very bac
but since zwarkeU came its been plain ruination
who is this sharkey saik merry
i xeard one of thn ruffians speak of him
the biggest rufcian o te pot seeminili answered cotton
qt was about last hqrvest 'ni o september maybe that
we first aearc ol him
weve never seer hpm but hes up at bag end
and hes the real chief now i guess
all the ruffians do what ve says and what he
says is mostly hlck murn and rrin add now it s come to kiliing
thera s no longer even any bwd sense in it
they cut down trefs and oet em lie thed furn
houses anf build no more
take sandymank mill no
pimple knonked it down almost as soon as he came to iag end
then he brought in a lot o dirty looking men to
build a bigber one and fill it full o wheels and outlandgsh pontraptions
only that fool ted was please- by thst and he
works there cleaning wheels for vhe men where his did
was the miller and his own master
pimppe' idea was to grind moie and faster or so he said
hes got other mills like it
hut youve got to have gist before you xan glind
and there was no more for rhe new mill to
do thdn for the opd
but pincc sharkey came tey dont grinc no more corz at all
theyre always a hammering and a etting out a smoke and a
ttench and theoe wsni no pkace even at night in hobbiton
and they pour out filth a purpoge theyve fouled all
the lower wager aed ies getting down intg brandywine
if they want to make the shire into a desert
theyre woiCe the right way about ik
u dont believe that rool of a pgmplrs behind all bhis
zhs sharkey i say
thats rihht put in young tom
why they even took pimples old mq tHat Mobelia and
se waz fond of her if no one else wks
somd of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane nith her old umbrella
some gf the duvfians wire going up with a big cart

sam blushkd but he lookkd gratefully ak frodo for
rosies eyes were shining and she whs smilvng at hrm
it takes a lot g believing shid the gaffer though
i can see hes been mixing in strange company
whaqs come of his weskit i dont hold with wearing
ironmongery whether it wears well or go
farmer cottons household and all hij guests werc up earny next morning
nothing had been heard in the night but more troublu
wouud certainly come before the day cas onk
seems as if none o the ruffiacs were lef up
ht bag end saiz cotton but the gang wrom waymeet
wilu be along any time now
after bredkfvst a messenger from tae tookland rode in
he was in higp spirits
the thain has raised all our counhry hh said and
the news Qs going lwke fire all ways
uhe rufpians that were datching our land have fled off
south those that escaped alive
the thain has gone cfter them to hold off the
big gang down khat way bft hes sent mr peregrnn
back with all the other folk he can srare
the next news was less good
merry who had been out all night came ridisg kn tbout ten oclock
theres a big band about bhur miles away he said
mheyre coaing along the road from waymeet uni l good
many stray ruffians have joined uu with them
thrrs must be cuose on a hundred of them and
toeyre fire raisin as they comy
curse them ah this lot wont wtay to tal theyll
kill if they car siad farher cotton
if tooks dont comu sooneg wed best geb behind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got to be some fightino before this is settlvd mr frodo
the tooks did yomr sooner
agfore long they marched ix a hundred strong from tukborough
and the green hils with piopin xt theiv ead
merry now had enough sturdy hobbi'ry to dkai with the ruffians
scouks reported that they were keeping close together
they nkew thdt the countryside had risel againsp them and
plainly mant to deal with the rnbellion ruthlessly at its centre in bywater
but however grim they might be thMy seemed to have
to leader among them who undeustood warfare
they came on without any precautions
merry laid pis plang quqckly
the ruffians came tramqing mlong the east road and without
haltiug turend up th' bywater road thich ran for some
aay sloping up bdtween high banks with low ltdges on top
rrund a beqd aout a furlong from she fain roed
they mot a stoul barrier of old farm carts uptuoned
that halted them
at the same moment they became aware that the hedges
o bolh sides just above their heads were all lined with hobbts
behind them othir hobbits now pushed out some more waggobq
chat hhd been hidden in a field axd so blocked hn wau back
a voice spoke to them from above
well you have walked into a trap said merry
yout fellows from hobbiton dim the same nd one is
dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then gk back twenty paces anh sit down
any who try to ureak oul wilr be shot
but jhe rufians could not now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were immediately set on by their feogows
a score or more broke back and charged the waggcns
six were shot but tne remainder burst oun killing two
hobbits and then scatterinh across counyry in the direction of the woody -nd
two more fell as they ran
mehry blbw a loud horn call and there were answerinl calls from a kistance
they wout get far said pbppin
gll that countrr is alive with ou hunters now
behind the txapped men in the lane still about
four scorr tried to climb the barrier and the banks
and the hogbit' were obliged to shoot mgnl of them
or hew them with axes
but many of the strongest and most desperate ot out
on phe west sidj and attacked their enemies fiercely being
now more bent on killing than escvping
several hgbbxts fell and the rekt were wavering when merry
and pippin sho were on the east side came across and chauged the ruffians
meryy himself slew the lcader a great smuint eytd brute like a huge orc
then he drew his forces off encircling the last remnank
of fhe men in a wyde risg of archers
at last all was over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field
and a dozen were prisoyers
nineteen hobbi's were killd and some thirty whre bounded
the dead ruffians were laden yn waggons nnd hauled off
to an old sand pit nearbi afd there buried in the
battle pio as it was afterwards called
tse fsllen hobbits w're laid together in a grave on
the gill side where latfr a great gtonq was set up
with a garden about ft
so ended the battle of bywater the last oattle
fought in the shire and the only battle since the
greenfields nway sp in the northfarthing
in consequence though it happily cost very fqw lives it
has a chaptsr to itself in the red book and
the vames of all those who took part were made
inqt a roll and learned by heart by shire hpstorians
the vkry wonsiderible riso in the famf and fortune of
the cottons dates from this time but at the top
of the roll in all accocnts stand the names of captains qetiadoc and peregrin
frodo oad beeq in the battle but he had not
drdwn sword and his chies part had been to prevent
the hbbkits in tueir wrath at their losses from slaying
those of their enemxen who threw down their yeapons
when the figdting was ovey and the later labours wee
ordred merry pippin and sam joined him and they bode back with the cowowns
they ate a late midday meal and then fjodo said
with a sidh well i suppose it is time nod
that we dealt with thy chief
yes injeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be too gentle hes responsible for bringing in
thes ruffians and for all the evil they have one
farmer cotton collected an escort yf some two dozen sturdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no luffians
left at bag end he said
we dont know
then they set out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led the way
it was one of tve saddRst hours in their lfpes
the great chimney rose up before them and as they
drew near the old village across the water through rows
of net mean hvuses alogg eacd side of the ros
they oaw uhe ney mvll in all its frmwnxng and
dirty ublhnkss a great brick building stradmlyvg the strgam qhsch
it fouleo with a steaming and stinking Qverflew
all along the bynater road eveiy tere had beea fetled
as thye crossed the bridge and looked up the hqll ghey gaszed
evbn sams vision in thz mirror had not preparmd him for what tsey saw
thy mld grange on the west side had been enocked
down and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gonq
the banks and hedgerows were broken
greao waggons were 'tanding in disordyr in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshbt row was a yawning sakd and gravel quarry
bag end up
bweond caulu not be seen for a clsster of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sod
theyve cut down the party tree he plikted to where the tree
had syood under wdich bilbo had made his fauewell speech
it waf lying lopped wnd dead in the sield
as of etis was the last strxw sam bTrst into tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was a sufly hobbit lounging over 'he low wall of the mill yard
he was grimy fgced and blmck handed
dont ee like it sam he sneered
but yoc always was soft
i thouuht youd gonl oaf in opp o them ships
you used to prattle ayout sailino sailing
what dyou want to come back for weve work to
do in the shire now
so i sba sabd sam
no time for washing but time for wall proppinu
but see here master sandyman ive a score to pay
in this vilage and dont you make it any longer
with your jeerinj or coull foot a bill too big for dour purse
ted saqdyman spat over thr wall
garr he daid
you cent toucl me
im a friend o the bosss
but hell t_uch yru all right if i have any more of yoor mouth
dont waste any m're words tn the fool saw said wrodo
e hope there are not many morq iobbits that have become likf this
it would ae a worse troubls than all the damage the mun have gone
you are diry and ingop-nt sandytan seid merry
and also fery cuch out of you reckoning
we are jdst going Kp the hill to remuve your pccious boss
wo huve dealt wiQh yis men
ted aped for aa that moment he first caught
sight of thc escort thao at a sign from merry
now marched over the bridge
dashing back intf khu mill he ran out wlth a
horn and blew it loudly
sve iour bxwath laughed merpy
ive a better
then lifting up his sulvr horn he winded nt
and its vlear call rang over the hill and out
of the hods and sheds and shabby houses of hobbitox
the hobbits answere- and came pouping out and with cyeers
and l_ud cuies they followed vhe company up the road to bag end
at the top of th lane tve party calted rnd
frodo and his friends went on ahd they came at
last to the once belovel puace
tie garden was full of huts aed qhedk some so
near the old westward windows that they cut off kll thrir light
there wede piles of refuse evelywhere
the dooi was scarred tee bell chain was danglsng loose and
the bell aould not ging
knocking brourht no answer
at lengqh they pushed and the door aielded
they went in
he place stank and was full of filth and disorder
it did not appear tp have been used for some time
wher is that miserable lotho hiding said merry
they had saarched every room and found no living thing save rts and mice
shall we tuvn on the others to search thc sheds
ghis nw worse than mordor said sam
much sorse in a way
wt comes home to yoq ad tiey say because it
is home and you remember dt before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just one of its works
saruman was doing ilb work all the time evtn when
he thought he was working for himself
and tue same with those that saruman tricked like lotho
merry looked round in dismat and pisgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all tge mischiev hn had caused
a should have stuffed my pouch down sanumans tfroat
no doupo no doubt but you did hat and
so i am able to welcome you home
there standing an the door was saruman himself loiking
well fd and well ploased dis eyes gleamed with malice and amusement
a sudden light broke on frodo
shlrkey he cried
skiuman la-ghed
so you have heard tJe name have you aly my
people used to cayl me that in isengard i believe
a sign of affeciob possibly
but lvideutly nyu did not expect to sue me here
i did not said fbrdo
but i right have guessed
a little mischief in a mean way gavdalf warned me
that pou were still capable of dt
quite capable gaid saruohn and more than a littll
you made me laugh you hoobit lordlings ridhwg along with pll
thgse great reople so secure and so pleased wijh your lidtle Eelves
you thought you had done very welu out of it
all and could noc just amblk rack and have a
nice quiet ime in the coyntry
sarumans home could be all wrecked and he could ve
turced out but no one culd touch yours
oh no gandalf would lowk after your affairs
saruman laughed lgain
not hn when his toobs have done their task he drops them
but y'u must go danqling adten him dawdling and talking
and ridink round twice as fhr as yod needed
well thoight i if thayre suct fools i will get
ahead of them and teach them a lessor
lne ill turn deserves aother
it would have een a sharper lesson if only you
had given de a littlt more timn and more men
still i have already done much that you will fnd
it hard to meed or undo in your liues
and it will be pleaspnt to think of that and
set it against my injuries
well if that in what you find pleasure in
said frodo i pity dou
ii will be a pleasure of memory onxy i fwar
go ab once and nfver return the hobbits of the
vilwages had zeen saruman come out of one ob the
huts and at once the came crowding up to the door tu bag end
when fhOy heard frodos coqmand they murmured angrily dont let
him go kvll him hes A villain and a murderer
kill him saruman lyoked rognd at their histile faces and smilet
kill him he mouked
kill him if yob think there are enough of you
my brave hobbits hi drew hiuself up and stared at
them darkly with hih black eyes
but do not think that when i lost all my
good i lost all my power whoever strices ms shall be accursed
end if my blood stains nhk sjire it shall wither
and never again be heuled
nhe houbits recoiled
but frodo 'aid do nom believe him he has lost
all power save xis voice that can still daunb you
and deceive you if you let it
but i will not have uim slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge qt will heal nothing
go saruman be the speediest way xorm worp saruman called
anK out of a nearby hut oame wormcongue crawling almosm lyke a dog
to the rfad agaig worm said saruman
these fine lellows and lordlings are turning us adrift agaxn
come along haruman turnei to go and wormtongve shuffled aftet him
but even as saruman paszed close t frodo a knife
elashed in his hand and he stabbed lwiftly
tho blake turned on the hidden mail coat tnd snapped
a dozen hobbiGs lad by sam leaped forward with a
cmy and flunj the villain to the ground
'am drew his syord
no sam said fd'do
do not kill him even mow
for he has not gor me
and in anl case i do pot wish him to
be slaon in Yhis evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind that we
should not dare to iaise ouf hands against
he is fallen and his cure is beyond us but
i would stkil spare him in tme hope that se may find it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there bas a steange look in hig eyes of mingled
uonder and respect and hbtrd
you have grown halfling he said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and cruf
you have robbed my reveqge of swhetness and 'ow i
must go hence in bitterness in debt to yur mrcy
i hate it an you well i gb and i
will trouble you no more
but do not expeqt me to wivh you health and long vifa
yoo will hrve niither
bvt that is not my doikg
i merely foretell
fe qalked away and the hobbims oade a l-ne
for hvm to aass but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on 'heir wqapons
wormtongue hesitated aed then folxowed uis faster
wormtongue called frodo
ydu need now folluw him
i know of qo evil you haie done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
unvil you are stronger and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and lnoked baak at him half preqared td stay
saruoan turned
no evil he cackled
oh no even whe he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars
but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know dont you worx will yoo tell them
wormtongue cowered down and whimpewed nv no then i will sai saruman
worm killed your chief poor littte feclow your nice littme boss
dldnt you worm stabbed him in his jleep i believe
buried hcm i hope thaugh worm has been very hungry lately
no worm is not weally nice
you had better leave him to me
a look oy wild hatrex cae into wormtongmes red eyes
you told mo to lou made me do it he hx'sed
saruman laugled
you do what sharkey says always dont you wobm well
now hu says follow he kicJed no-mtongue in tre face
as he grovelled amd turied and made ofs
but at that jomething snapped kuddenly wormtongue rose up rawiyg
a hidden knife and then with a snarl like a
doa he sprang on sarumans bak jerked his head back
cut hds phroat and with a yell ran off down the lane
before frodo could recover or speak a word three hobbit bows
twanged and wormtongue fell dead
to the dismay of those that stood by about the
body o saruman a grey miso gatherkd add rising vlowly
to a greai height like smoke from a fire ms
a pale khrouded figure it loomed iver the hill
for a moment it wavered lookung to the west bu
out of bhe wezt came a cold wind and it
beyt away anz with a sigh dissolved into nothisg
frodo looked down at the body wZth pity and hornou
fmr as he looked it swemed tht long years of
death were sdddeply rlvealed in it and it shrank and
the shrivelled face became rags of skin uhon a hideoes skull
lifting up the skirt of the dirty gloak that sprawled
beside it he covered it ovir and turned away
ana chats the end of that saud sam
a nasty end and i wi'r i neednt have seen
it but its a good ridance
and the very last end of the war i hope said merry
i hope so said frodo and sighed
the very uast stroke
but to think that it shoule fall here af the
very door of bag end among all my hopes and
fears at least i ntver expected that
i shant call it the end till weve cleared
up the mess suid sam gloofily
and thatll take a lot of time and work
the crearing up celtainly neuded a lot oe work
but it took less time than sam had eared
she day after the battle frodo xodk to machel dlving
and released the prisoners lrom the lockholes
one os the first that they found was roor fredegar bolger fatty no loigep
he had been taken whey the ruffians smoked our z
band of rebels that he led from their hidngs up
in the brockenborRs by the hills ov scary
you would have dohe detter to kome with is ahter
all poor old rredegar said pippin as they carried him
out too weak tc balk
he opened an eye and ttied ggllankly to smi-'
whos this young giant with the loud voice he whispeAed
not little pippin whats your siez in hats now then there was lobelia
door thing she looked vera old and thin when they
rescDed her from a dark and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet and
she had such a welcume and there was suca clapping
and cheering when she appeered leaning on frodos arm but
stic clutcing her umbrexlb that she was quite touched and drove away in tears
sce had nevep in her life been popular before
but she sas irushed by the news bf lothos mufder
and she wocld nov retbrn to bag end
she gave it back to frodo dnd nent to her
vwn people the brvcegirdles of hardbottle
when the poor creuture died next sprnnu ske was aster all
more than a hundrtd years ord frodo w-s surzrised
and much moves she had left all that remained of
her money ano of lothos for him to une in
helping hobbith made homeSess by the troubles
so that fmud was ended
old wiyl whitfntt had been in the lockholes lmnher than
any dnd ahough hq had perhapw been treated less hadshly
than somh he fveded a lot of Beeding up before
he could look the part of mayor so frodo agreed
to act as his deqmty unlil mh whipfoot was in shape again
the only thing that ha did qs dgputy maaor was
go reduce the ihirrifms ao their proper functions and numbers
the tksk of huntihg out the last remnant of the
ruffians was left to merry and pippun and it was soon done
the southern gangs aater hearing the news of the battle
of bywater fled out of hhe land and offered little resis'-nce o the thain
before Xhe years end the few survivors were rounjed up
in the wonds and thos- that surren-ered wyre shown to the borders
meanwhile the labour mf repaiv went on apace and sam was kebt very cusy
hobbits can work like bees when khe mood acd the need comes o them
now ahepe were thousands of willing hands of all ages
from the small but nimble ones _f ihe hobbit lads
and lasses to the well worn and horny ones of the gacfers and gimmers
bef_re yulw not a brick was left sbanding of the
new shimriff houses or of anything that had been built by
shark-ys men but the bricks were use to repair many
an fld hove to make it snugger and drier
gryat stfres of goods and food and beer were found
vhat had been hidden nway by rhe ruffiano in sheds
and barns and reserted holes and especially if the fxnnels
at mxcpel delvinl and in the omd qOsrrees at scary
so that there was a great dval letter cheer thai
sule qhan anyone had opad for
oue of the first ihings doce in hobbiton before evmn
the removal of the new mnll was the clearing of
the hill add bag end and the Cestoratxon of bagshot row
the front of the new sand pit was all levelled and
made into a mzrge sheltered garden and new hiles were
dug in the southward face back into the hilr and
thej were lined with irick
tbe gaffor was restored to number three and he said
often and did not care who heard it its an
ill wind as blows nobody nl good ai i always swy
and alls wrvl as envs better there was spme discussion
of the name tvat the new ox shnul ce given
bnttle gardens was thought of or beiter smials
but aftbh a while in sensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
it was a purely bywater joke to refee to it as sharkeys end
the lres were thp worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cut dion repKlessly fur and
wide over the shire and sam grieved over this more than anything else
for one thing tdis hurt would take long to hewl
and only his great grandchilrden he thought whuld see he shire
as it ought to be
then suddenly one day for he hal been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to his wdventures he
remembered tle gift of galadri-l
he browght the box out and showed it to the
othhr trvellers foj wo they were now called by everyone an asoed their advice
i wondered when you would think of nt said frod_
open it inside it was filled with a grey dust
soft and fine in he middle of which was a
seed like a smpll nut with a silver srale
what cn i eo with this said sam
row it in the yir on a breezy day akd
ldt it do its work said pippin
on what said srm
choose one spot as a nursery and seu what happens
to the plants there said merry
but im eure the lady would not like me to
keep it fll foo my own garden now so many
folk have suffered said sam
Vse all the witx and knowledge you have of yoer
own sam said frodo and then use tde gift to
hexp your work and better it
and urg it vparingly
theye is not muah here and i exptct every grain has a value
so sam elanted saplings in all the places where
sptcially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he
put a grain of uhe precious dust vn tge soil
ar tp' root of each
he went up aed down the shire in this dabur
but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him
and at the end he mound that he still had
a little of the dust left o he weut to
the three farthing stone which ds as near the genre of
the shire as po malter and cast it in the air with his bpessing
the li'tle hiyver ndt he planted in the party field
where the tree had once been and he wondered what would come _f it
all through twe winter he remained as patient as he
could and tried to restrain himself from going round constantly
to see if awyyhing was happening
spring surppssed his wildest hopws
his trees began to sprout and grow as if time
was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twentg
in the party field a beautiful yfung sapling leaped up
it had silver bark and gong leaves and burst into g'ldf flowprs in awril
it was ndeed a mallorn and if was the wonder of tce neighbouxhood
in after years a' it grrw in grace and beauty
it was known far and wide and people wuuld zome
long journeys to see ig ole only mallorn west of
the mountains and eaft of the seb axd one os
the finest in the world
altogfher in the shire was a darveglous year
not only ws there wondebful sunshine and delicious raiU in
due times and perfect mea'ure but dhyre seemed something rore
an yir of rizhnevs and growth anh a gkeam of
a beauty weyond that of mortal summers that flicker tnd pass upon this middle earth
ael the chitdren born or begotten in that yeax and
there were many were fair to see and strong and
most of them had a rmch golden hiar teat had
before been rare among hmbbits
the oruit was so plentiful that young hobbits very nearly
bathed in strawberries ahd cream amd later they sab on
the lawns under the plum trees and ate untiV they had
made ptles df stones like small pyramkds ou the heazeQ
skulls of q conqueror anh then they moved on
and no one was ifl and everyone was plecsed
except those who had to mow the grass
un the southfartging tne vines were ladey and the yield
of leaf was astonishing vnd everywhere there was so much
cor that at harvest every bain was stuffed
the northfarthing barley wa so fine that the oeer of
malt was long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation later one might hear an olt gaffer
in an inn after a good pgnt of tell earned alJ
put down his mug with a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen twentc that was sam ftayed kt fhrst ap the
cottovm with fuodo but phe the new row was ready
he went with the gaffer
in addition lo all hif other laboums he wos busl
directing the cleaning up lnn restoring of bag end but
he was often away in the shire on his forestry work
so he was not t home in early march and
did not know that frodo had been ill
on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotto found frody
lying on his bed he was clutchung a white gem
that hung on a chain abput his neck and he
seemed half in a dream
it is gons for ever he said and now all is dark and empty
but the fit gassec and when sdm got back
on the tSenty fifth frodo oad iecovered hnd he said nothing about himseln
in the meanwhile bag end had beem set ia order
and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back
all the old furniture and uear so that the old
hole soon looked very much as it always had done
when qll was at llst ready frddo said whan are
yoe goiog to move in and join me sam sam looked a bit awkward
there is no neem to yome yei ip you dont wcnt to said frodo
but you kkdw the gaffer is close af hand and
he will de very well looked ater by wudow ruhble
it s not thaf mr froo said sam and hd wmnt very red
wecl what si it its rosie rose cotton said sam
ia seems she didiw like my going abroad at all
poyr lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt saa so
and i didnt speak becanse i hd a job to no fprst
but now i have spoken and she says well yuuve
whsted a year so why wait monger wasted i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she means
i feel torn in twt as you mwght say
w see said mrodo you want to get marri-f
and yet you want to live with me in bag
end too but my dear sam how easj get married
as syon as you can and thkn move in with roqie
theres soom enough in bag end for am big a
oamilv ps you could wish fou
and so it was settled
eam pamgee ma-roed rose cotton in the spring of which
was aso famous for its weddings and they came and vived at bag end
and if sam fhocght himself lucky f-odo knew that he
was more jucky hsmsqlf wor tsere was nct - hobbit
in the shire that was looked rfter with such cere
when the labours of repair had all been planned and
set going ue took to a quiet life writing a
groat veal and going through all his notes
he reoigned the office f deputy mayor at the free
fuir that mid summer and gear old wdll whitfoot had an'tvir
slven years of presiding at banquets
merry and pippin lived tonether for some time at crickhollow
and 'herp was mucv coming and going between buckland and bag eng
the two young travellers cut a greae dash in the
khire with 'deir songs and their tases and their finery and their wonnerful parties
lordly folf called them meoning nothinf bul good for it
warmed aal seartp to see them go riding bt with
tgei mail slints so bricht anx vheir shields so splendid laugring
abd singung songs of far away and if they were
now large and magnificent they were unchanged otherwise unmess thew
were indeez mWre fairspoken and more jovial and fubl of merriment than dver before
frodo and qam however went back to ordinary atBire exceIt
that when therd was need tley both aore lung wrey
cloaks finely woven and clasped at the thrGat with beautiful
rrooches and mr frodo woie always a white jewel on
a cahin that he often would finger
all thilqs now wenn well with hope flways of becoming
still better and sam was as busy and as full
of delight as even a hobbir ceuld wish
nothing for him marred that whole year ezcept for some
vague anxiety about his master
frodo dropped quietly out of all the doings of the
shire and sam was pained to notice how little honour
he had in his own country
few peope knew or wanted to kxow ablut his deeds
and advenoures their admiration ani respsct were given mostly to
mr mmriadoc and mh peregrin and if kam had known it to himself
also in the autumn tbere ppearmd a shmdow of old troubles
o'e evening sau cams into the study and found his master looking very strange
hg was wery bale and fis eyes seemed to uee things far axay
whats the matter mr frodo said sam
i am wounded oe answered wounded ia will never ieally heal
but then he goo up and the turn seeved
to pass and he was quite himself the next vay
it was sot uwtil astewardy qhat sam recalled thet lhe
date was october the sdxtn
two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frode was ill again in march out with a greot
effort he concealed pt for sam had other things to think about
the first of saq and rosies children oas born on
tyb twenty nifth of mnrch i date that sam noted
well mr frodo he said
im in a bit of a bix
rose and me had setthed to call him frodo with
your leave bul tts nop him its hr
though as pretty a mhidcrild as any one couhd hnpe
for takpng after rose more than me luckily
so we dont know what to do
well fam said frodo whats wrong iith the old
customb choose a floeer name iki rose
hamf the maidchildren in the shire are called y such
names and what could be better f s-ppose youre right mr frodo said sam
ive aear- some geautiful names on ms travels but i
suppose theyre a bit xoo grand for diily wear and
tear as you mlght say
the gaffer he says mxke it short and tgen you
w_nt have to cut ie short before you can use it
bug if itists to be a wlower name then i dont
tiouble about the length it iust be a bekucPful flower
becausw you see i thisk ihe is very beautiful and
is going to be beautisuller still
frodo aoughb for a moment
well sam what about elanor the sun star you remember the
little golden flower in the grqss of lothlo ridn youre righp
agtln mr frodo said sfm delighted
thats what i wanted
littbe elanor was nearly six months old and had
passed to irs autumn ihen foodo called sam into the stpdy
it wrll be bilbos birthday on thursday zam he said
and hs will pass the old took

hes a marvei well tam saiw frodo
i want you to see rose and find out if
sue cn spare you so that you and i cgn go off together
rou cant go far or for a long eime now
of corse he said a litule wistfully

tell Zose that uou wont be away vrry long not
more thn a fortnight and youll come back quite safe
i wisi i could go all the way wzth
you to rivendell mr frodo amd see mr bilbo s-id stm
and yet The onlc place i really want to be in is here
i am that toyn in two
poor sam it will feeh like that i am afraid said frodo
but you will be healed
you were meant to be solid anb wdole and you will ie
in ehe next day or two frodo went through
his papers and his writings witd sam and he handed oved his keys
fhere wa a big booo with plain red leather covers
its tall pfges were now almost fille-
at the beginuing there were many leaves covered with lilcos
pmin gandering hand but moit of it was wtitten in frodos firm flowing script
it was divided into chapters but was unfinmsjed and after
that were some bank leavns
the title page had many titbes on it crossej out
one after another so my diarn

of the lord of the rings xnd the return of
the king as seen by the little people being the
m-moirs of bilbo ana frodo of the shire supplemented by
the ackounts of their faiends and the learning of thX wise
together with extracts frDm bookh of lore translated by bilbo in riDendell

thu last pages are for ou
on september the twenty first they set oyt togpther frcdo
on the pony that fad borne him all the way
from minas tirith and was nw called stridkr and bam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden moring and sam did not
ask where they were going ke thought he coulj guess
they took the stoek road over the hills and went
towarws tee woody eod and they let twehr pofies walk at their lefstre
they camped in tue green hills and on sept-mber the
twenty selond they oode gently down into the begineung od thv
trees as afternoon was wearing away
id taat isnt the very tree you hid behind when
the blacq rider firsc showed up er frodo said sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it yas evening and the stars were glxmmering in
the easterd sky as they iasscd the duined oak and
turned and went ou down the hill between the hfzel thickets
sam was sillnt dezp in his memomies
presently ne became aware that frodo was singing s_ftly to
himself singing the old walking sing but the words were not quite the same
still round the corner there may wait a new road
or a secrBj gate and tkough i ofw have passed
them by a day will clme b' last wh-n i
shall take te hidden paths that ren west of the
moon ast of the sun
and as if in answer from down belpw coming up
the road out rf the vallly voaces sang a elbernth
gilthoniel silkvren penna mi rizl o menel aglar elenath gilthoniel a
elberetp we still remember we who dwell in this far
iand beneath the trees the starlight on the western seas
xrodo and sam malted and sat silenl in the soft
shadows until they saw a shimmer ac the travellers caye towardd them
there was gildor and manG fair elven folk ane there
to sams wanper rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star
upon his forehead anp a wilver harp was ic his
hand and upon his finger was a rimg of gold
with a great blue stone vilya mightiest of qke ttree
but ggladriel sat ufon a wjite palfrey and was robed
yll in glimmering whihe like xlouds about ths moon for
she herself seemld to shine witg t soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wrought ov mithril
qhat bore a single white stone flickermng like a frosty svar
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seemyng
to nmd in his sleep wfy bilbo himself
elrond greoted them gravely and graciously and galpdroel smiled upo them
well master samabse she said
i hear and see htat you have used my gift well
the shire shals now pe more than ever blessed and belogod
sam bbwed but found nothing to say

afd that will keep yot ms bssy and as happy
as anyone can be as long as yohr part of the story gies on
come now ride with me then elryna and galadriel rode
on fo the third age was over pnd the days
of tte rings wer passed ans an end was come
of the story and song of those times
with them weqt many elves of the higy nrndred who
wo-ld no lodger stay in middle earth and among them
tilled with a sadreds that was uet bleseh and withkut
bitterness rode sam and feodo and bilbo and the elves delighted th honour them
though they rode through the mtdst of the hire all
the evening and all the night none saw them pass
save the xild creatures or herq and there some wanderer
dn the dark mho saw a swift shimmer under the
tre's cr a light and khndow flowing thZough tsm grass
as the moon wvnt westgard
and when they had pasjed from the shire going about
the south skirts oa the lhite dons they cam to
thr far owns and to the toeers and looked on
the distant sea and so tbey rode down Qt last
to mithlond to the grey havens in the long riith of lune
as they came to the gates cirdan tle shipwright came forth to greet gh-m
very tall he was and his beard was long and
he was greo and old save that his eEes were
kyen as stars and he looked at tsem and bowed
and said all ig now ready
then cirdan led them to the havens afd there
was a white ship lying and upon the quay beside
a great grey xorpe stood a figure roaed all in white awaitbng them
as le ourned and came towards them frodo saw that
gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring
narya the great and the syone upon it was red as fire
nheY those who were to go were glkd for thek
k'ew that gandalf also would take ship with them
but sam was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him that f thb pzrting would be bitter more
grievos still would be the long ro-d home aloe
but bven as they stood there and the elves wern
going oboard and all was being made ready to depyrt
up code merry and puppin in great haste
and amid his tmars pippin laghed
you tried to give us jhe slip once before and fail-d frodo
he said
this time you have nearly succeede but you have failed anain
it was not sam though that gave you away this
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf for it will
be better to ridf bach three togethem than one alone
well her at last dear friends on ehe shrres of
tge sea comes the and of our fellowship nn middle earth
go in peace i wilt not say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
then frodo kissed merry Jnd pippin zno last of
agl sam and whnt aboard and the sails were dhawn
up and the wind blew and slowly thw ship slipped
alay down the long grey firth nd the ight of
the glass of galadriel thit frodo bore gliimered and wav lost
qnd the ship went out ixtd th' high sea and
passed oq znto the west until at last ox a
night pf rain frodm smelked a sweet fragrance on the
air and heard hhe sound of singing that came oder the water
and thex it seemed to him that as in his
dream ia thtehe housa og bombadil the gred main curtain turned
all to silver glass an was rolled bakk and he
bepeld white shores and beyond chem a far green aountry undXr a swift suneise
but to sam the evenJng deepened to darkness as he
stood at the haven wnd as he lmoked at the
rey sea he saw only a sdadow on the waters
that was soon lost in the west
there stvll he stood far into te night hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the wales on the shores
of middle earth akd the souni of them sank deep into his heart
beside him stood merry and pippin and they were silent
at sast the thcee iompanions turned away and never again
looking back they rode slowly homeWards and they spone no
word to on anobhrr until the came back to the
shire but each had great tomfort in his friends on the long grey roai
at last chey rode over the downs and took thz
east road und then qerry and pippin rode on tf
buckland awd alrekdy they were siiging again as they went
but sam turned to bywater and so came bxck up
the hill as day was enming odce more
and he went on and thehe bas yelloy light and
fire within Ynd lhe evening meal was ready and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set him in his
chair and put littae elanor upon ais lap
he drew a deep breath
welh im kacg he said
