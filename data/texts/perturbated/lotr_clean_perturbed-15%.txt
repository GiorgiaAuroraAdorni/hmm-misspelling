wheu mt bilbo baggins of mag end annouyced that he
wobld shortly be celebrating his elevnty first birthday iith a arty
of special magnificece there yas mpch talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo was very rich aud very peculmar and had been
the wonder of the shire for sixty years ever since
his remardpble disappearance and unexpected rlturn
the riches he had brought bak froq his travels had
now beclml a local legend and it wos popultrly believed
whatever dhe old fojk might say that the hill at
bag end was xull 'f tunmels stuffed with tneasure
and if that waj not enough for fame there was
qlso his prolonges vigour oo marvel at
time wore on but wt seemeh to have little effect on mr baggins
at uinety he was much the same as at fifty
dt ninety nine they began to cals him well preserved lut unchanged
would have been nearer tme mtrk
there were some that shook their headw asd thoughb bhis
was too much of f goof thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possesf apparently perpetual youth as eell as reputedly inexhaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for they said
it isnt natumal anj trouble will come of it but
so fap trouble had not come and as mr baggins
wss generoui wiht his ioney most peopwe were wclling to
forgivfeorgive him his oddvties mnd his good fortune
he demained on viziting tefms with his relatives except of
courde the sackville bagginsqs and he had manj devoted admirers among
the hobbits sf poor and unimportant fsmilies
bua he had no closO friends until some of his
younger cousins bpgan to grow up
the eldest of these and bilbos favourite was young nrodo baggfns
when bilbo was nindty nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and brought him to lite bt bag end and
the hopcs o the sackvible bagginsep wlre finalbl dashed
bilbo and frodo happened to hevz the same birthday skptymber nd
yob had better come and live here frodo my lad
said bilbo one day and then we can celebrate our birthgay parties comfortkbly tdgether
at tnat sime nrodo wab still in his tweens
as uhe lobbits oalsed the irresponsible twenties between byildpood and
coming ol age at thirty three
twelvc more years passed
each ytar the bagginses had givgn bery lively combined birthday
parties zt bag end but now it was understnod that
something qtite exceptionau wcs being planned for that autuvn
bilbo was goimg so be eleventy kne a rather curious
number and a very respectalle age for a hobbit the
old took himself hpd only reached and frodo was
going to be thirty three an ioportant number the date
ox his ciming of age
tonguej begkn to wau in hobbitox kid bywater and rumour
of the roming event travelled all oveh the shire
thl history and chvracter of mr babo baggins became once
again the shief topic op conkersation and the older folk
suddenly found theyb rsmiqiscences ie welaome demand
no ose had a more attentivi audiencw than old ham
gtmgee commonly known as the iaffer
he geld forvh at the iv bush a xvall inn
on tte bywater road and he spoke with some authority
for he hap tended the gardea at bzg end for
forty years and had helpee old holman in the same job before thae
now that he was imself gfowing lld and stiff in
the jhints the job wawsas maily carried on y him youngest son saa gamgee
both father and sot were on very friendly lerms wity bilbo and frodo
thny lived on tho hill itself in number bagohot row iust below bag end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbd as ive
acways faid the gaffer declared
with perfect truth for binbo was very polite to im
calling him master hamfast and consulting him konstantly upon the
growing of vegetableb in the matmer of roots esvecnalpy
potatos the gaffer was ecognized as the leading authority by
all in the neighboubhood hncludnng himself
but what abour this frodo that lives with him ascdd old noakes of bywater
baggins is his name but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
zt beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go
lookiff for a wife awar there in buckvand whee fooks pce so queer
ani ny wonder theyre queer put in daddy twofoot
the gaffers next dorr neighbour if they live on dhz wrong
side of the brandyike river ahd right agin the old forest
thafs a dark bad place gf haln the tales be true
ooule right dad said the gaffer
not ehat tne brandybuczs of ruck lqnd live in the old
forest but theyfe a queer broed seemingly
they fooc about oith tonts on that bpg river awd that isnt natural
small wondcr that trouble came of iu i say
but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit ls you could wbsh ti meet
very much like mr rilbo and in more tman looks
after all his father was a baggivs
a decent respectable hobhnt was mr drogo bagbins there was
never much to tell of him till he was drowndvd
drownded eaid several vomces
they had heard this and other darker rumours beforn of
course but hobbits wave a passion fr damily history and
they were ready t hear it again
well so they say said the gaffer
you see r drogo he harried poos miss primula braudybucq
hhe was out mr oilbos fidst cousin on the mothers
side her mothex beig mhe eoungest of the old tooks
daughters and mr dfogo was his second cousin
si mr frodo is his first asd second colsin oncp
removed either way as the saying is if you follow me
and mu drogo was staying at brawdy hall witd his
father in Gaw old mwster gorbaboc as he often did after his
marriage him being patial to his vittlen and old gorbadoc
keeping a mzghty gcnerous table and he went out boatingon
hhe brendywine river and he and yis wife vere drownded
and poor mr frodo only y child and all
ive heurd thoy went on tle waper after dinner
in the moonldght said old noakes and it was drogos
weight as punk the boat
and i heard she pusied eim in and he
pullcd her in after him eaid sandyman the hobhikon miller
you 'houldnt listen fo kll you hear sandyman said the
gaffer who did not much like the miller
there ixnt no call to go talking of pusihng and pulling
boats are quite trickv evough for those lhat sie still
without lookina further por the cause of urouble
anyuay there was this mr frodo left an orphan and
straned as you might say among tuse queer bucklanders beinb
brofght up avyhow iD oandy hall
a regular warren by all acceunts
ojd master gorbadoc Nyver had fewer than a couple kf
hundred relations in tve place
ur bilbv never did a kindes deed than when he
brouewt the lay back tp live among decent folk
but i reckon it las a nasty shock for those sackville bagginces
they thoughy they were going to get bag end that
time wheg he went off and was thought to be dead
and then he comes bcck and orders ehem off and
he gkes on livang and living and never looking a
day older bless him and suddenly he produces an heir
anR fas all rhe papers made oht mroer
the sackville bagginses wont never see the inside of bao
end now or it is to bd hoped not
thermn a tidy bit of money tuckew away up
there i hear tevl said a stranger f visitor nn
tsin'sz from michel celving in the westfarthing
all the top of your hill is fulh of tunnels
packed witk chests of gold and silver andjools bh hat ive heard
then youv hearQ more than i can speak to answered the gzfxer
i knfw nothing about jools
mr bilbo is free with hds mone and there seems
no lack hf it but i vnow of no twnnel making
i saw mr bilbo when he cafe baak a mattir
of sixty years ago when i was a lai
id not long Uome prentice to old holian him being
my dads cousxn but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing
all over tha garden while the sale ws on
and in thg middce of it all mr bilbo comes
up ihe uill with a pkyy and some mighty big
bags and a couple of chests
i dont doubt bhey were mostly full of treasure he
gad picked up in foreign parts wherw thmre be mountahns
of gold they say but there wasnt enmgh to fill tuwnels
but my lad sad will know more about that
hes in and out of gag end
crazy about stories of the old dayk he is and
he listens to ael mr filbos tales
ir bilbo has learned him his lelters mMaring no
harm mark you dnd i hope n' harm will come of it
elves and dragons i says to him
cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you
doat go eettmng mixed up in the busitess of tour
bqtters or youll land in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i might yay it to others he added with
a look at the strangvr ahd the miller
but the gaff'r did not convince his audieNce
the legend of bilbos wewlth was now too firmly fixed
in the minds of the yunger generatton of hobbits
ah but he las likely enough been adding to shat
he brought at first argueg the miller voicing common opipian
hes oftnn atay from home
and sook at toe outlandisl folk tkwt visit him dwarves
coming at night and trat old wandering conjuror gandalf and all
you csn say what you like gaffer hut baw ends
a queer place and its fonk are queerer
and you can say whay you like about what
you ynow no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retorted the gaffer disliking thr mctled even more than usual
if thats being queer then we could do with c
bit mvre queern-ss in thesq pafts
theres some n_t far away that wouldnt offer a pi't
th beer to a friend if they rived in a hole wUth golden walls
but they do things proper at bag end
our sam rays that everyones aoing to be invited ao
the party and theres going to be presents mark you
presenty for all this verf month as is
ohat very mnth was september and as fine as you oould ask
a day or two later a rumour probably started by
the knowledgeable sam was spread about that there wece going
tm be fireworks Gireworks what is morN such s
had not bten seen in the shirk for nigh on
a century not indeed sinpe the old took died
days passed and the day drew nearer
an odv looking waggon laden wnth okd looking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evening aid aoiled ub the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit ovrs to gape at it
it was driven by outlandish xolk singing qiuhnre songs swarves
with long beards and deep hoods
a few of them remainel at lag end
at the end of jhe seconj week in september a
oart came in throuhh bywater from the direction of nhe
brandywine bridge in broad daylight
an old man was driving it all aloqe
he wore a talh pointe blue aat v long grey
cloap and a silver scarf
iw had a long white beard and bushs eyebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of kis hat
small hobbit children ran aftur thg mlrt all troegp hobbiton and right up the hill
it had a cprgt of firewoks as they righwly guessed
at bilCos front door the old man uegan tp unload
there wete great bundles of fireworks of abl sorks and
shypes eahc labelled with a larae red g ant the elo rune
thaJ was g-ndalfs mark or course ynd the old man
was ga'dalf the wizard wose pdmv in the shire was
dce mainly to his skilf with fires smokes and lights
his real business was far morc difpiculx and dangerous but
thn shire dolk knew nothing about it
to them he was just ooe of the attractiocs t the party
hence th' excitement of the hobbit children
d for grand they nhouted ana the old man smiled
thsy knew him by sighv though ce omly appeared in
hobbiton sccasionally and nsver stapped long but veither they nor
nny but the ilde't of their elders had sqen one
yf his firework diTslay thel nfw belonged to the legensary past
when the old man heled by bilb and some dwdrves han finfshed unloading
bilbo gave a few penniij away but not a single
squib or cracker was vorthcoming to the dibppointment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
yu will jet plenty when the timq comes
then he disappedred inside with bilbD and thu foor was shst
the young hobbitf wtaree at the door in vain for
a while and tjen mwde off feelxng that the day
of ehe party would never pome
indide bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the
open window of a small room looking oit west on to the arden
the late afternoon was bright and peacefl
thh dlowers glowed red and golden snap dragons and sun floeers and
attuytiums trailing all oaer the turf walls aed peeping in at the round windows
how bright your garden loks faid gandblf
yes said bilbo
i m very fpnd indeed cf it cnd of all
the dear sld shife but i ihink i need a holiday
you mean to go ov with your plan ohen i do
i made up my mind months ago a'd i havent changed it
very wetl
it is no good saying any more
stick to your plan your whole plan mind
and q hope it will turn opt for thh hhst
for you and for all of us
i hope so
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday and have my little joke
who will caugh i wonzer said gandalf shaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
the neyt day more carts rolled up the hill and still more carts
thlre migh have been some grumbling about dealing locally but
that very week ordcrs pegvn to pour out _f bag
end for 'very kxnd of provision commodity or luxury that
could be obtainen in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in tee neighbourhood
pefple became enthusiastic and they began to tick off the
days on the calendar and they watched eageyly for phe aostman hoping foj invitations
bexorb long the inkitations began pouring out and thq hobbiton
post offcce was blocked and thh bywater post office was snfed ufdeh
and voluntary assistant postmnn were called for
there wls a constant stream of them going up the
hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank yuu i shall cetzinly come
a noticb appeared on the rate at bau end no
admittance except on parsy business
mven those who rad or prltended to have party business were seldom allowed inside
bilbo was busy writing invwtajiins ticking off knjweis pacning up
pfesents and making some privatp preparatiens of his otn
from the time of gandalfs agrkval he remained hidden rom view
one mornink the hsbbits woke to fink the large field
sauta of bilbos foont dnor covered with ropes and poles for ceyrs and pavilins
a special eybrmnce was cut into the bank leadinc to
the road and wide steps and a large white gate were built there
the three hobbit families of bagshot rob asjoining the fielp were
intensely integesfem and generally envied
old gaffer gamgee stmppPd evqn prethnwing to work in his garxwn
the tents bega to go up
there was a specmally large pavilfon ss big that the
tree that grew in txe fielb was righ insiae it
and stood proudly neat one end at the head of the chief table
lanterns were hggg oc all its branches
more profisibg still to rhe hobbits minc an enormous onen Pir
kitchen was krected in the norbh corner of the dield
a draught of cooks from every inn and ettino house
for miles arounc arrived to supplement the dwarves and other
odd folk that were quartered at lag end
excitement rese to its height
then the weather clouded over
that was on wednesday the eve a the party
anxiety was intfnse
then thursday septembdr the nd actually dawned
thf sun goa p tke clouds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun began
dHlbo baggins called pt a party but it was really
o variety of cvtertainmunts rolled into kne
practically everybody living near was invited
a very few gQre overlooked by wccident but as they
turned up all the same thad did not matter
many people from otcer parms yf the shire werz also
asked and thkre iere even a few froe outside the boDders
bilbo met the guests axd additionasdditions at the new white gate in person
he gave away presknts to all and sundry rae
latter were tnose who went out ggain by a bapk
way and came in again by the gate
hobbits give presents qo other people on tceir own birthdays
nwt very expensive oxss yi a rule and hy' so
lavashlj as on this occasion but it was not a bad nystem
actually in hobbJton and bywater everd day in the year
kt was somebodys birthday so that every jobbit in thoe
parts had a farr chance of al letst one resent
at least once a week
out they never gon thred of txem
on tss occasion tla preseys were unusually good
the hobbit children were so eycited that por a while they almost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of which bhey had nevpr
seen oefore all beautirul and some obviounly magical
many of them had indied been owdered a yebr befoie
and had coxe all the way from the mkuntain and
frofmrom dale vnd were of real rwbrf make
when every gest had been welcomed anw was finally insire
the gate there were songs dances Nusic games and of course food and drink
tyere were three official meals lunch tea and dinner or supper
but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by phe iact
that at those times all the guests gere ditting down and eating together
at oteer times there sere merely lots of peoule eating
and drineing codtmnuously urom elevenses pnmil six thirty wheb the fireworks started
the fireworks were by gandalf they weee not only brought
by cim but designfd and maye by hbm and the
special effects set pieces add flights of rockets were let off by him
but there was also a generous distribution of vquibs crackers
backarappers sparklers torxhes dwarf chndles elf fountains goblin barkers and thunder claps
they wvr all superb
thm art oo gandalf improved with axe
there were rockets ldke a llight of scintillating birds sinxing wyIh sweet voices
there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their
leaves opened lkie a whole spring unbolding in a momznt
anc their shiniag branches dropped glowing flowers down uqon the
astonishql obbits disapearinx with k sweet scenl jult before they touched their ulturned faces
there were fountains of bupterfjies thct flew litturing into the
trres there wbre pillars od coloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles or sagling ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a red thundersorm and a shower
of yelwow rain there was a forest 'f silver pears
that sprang sgddvnly into the ir with a yll like
an ombaotled army and came down agVin into the water
wkth a hiss lmke a hundred rot snakes
and there was also one last surprise in hofvur of
bilbo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf dntended
the ligsts went out
a greah smoke went up
it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the dxstance
and began to glvw at the suimit
it spouted gre-l and smarret flambs
out flew a red golden dragon not life size but terribly
life like fire came from his jaws his eyes glared d_wn
there was a roar and ae whizzkd three tines over
the heads of the crowd
they all ducked and many fell flat on th'ir faces
the dragon passZd like ah express train turned a somersault
and burst ov'r bywatmr with a deafening explosion
that ws the signal for supper said bilbo
the piin and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate
hgbbits lcaped to tjeir feet
thece was a splendid supper for everyone for evervone hat
is except those isvited to the special famly dinner pqry
tois was held Mk he great pavilion with the tree
the invitations were limlted to twelke dozen a number also
called by the hobbits one gross though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and the guests
were selekted from all the fmilies to which rilbo and
frodo were reiated with thb addinion of a uew special
unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young oobbits dere included nnd prcsent by parqntaa permisyion
for hobbits were easy going with qheir children in the matter
of sitting up late especially shen Rhere was a chance
of getting them a free emal
bringing up ynung hnbbits took a lot of provender
there wewe many bagginses and boffins and also many tooks
and brandybucks there were varikuy grubbs relations rf bilbo baggins
granomother and various chubbs connexions of his took grandfatver and
a selection of burrowces bolgers bracegirdles brockouses goodbodies hornblowees -nd proudfoots
some of these were only very ditantly connected with bilbo
and some of them had xardly evmr been in hobbiton
before as they lived in remote corners of the shere
the sackvillo baggilses were n_t forgotten
otho and Zis wife gobelia were present
they disliked bilbo and detested frodo bvt sg magnificenh was
the invitation card wsitten in gol-en inr that they had
felt et was impwssible to refuse
ecides their nousin bilby had been specializing in food for
mady years and his table had a high reputation
all the one oundred and foruy foor guests expected a plvasant
feast though eoey rabher dreaded the after dinner sweech of their host an inevitable item
he was liablm to drag in Mits of what he
called poetry and sometimes after a xlass or two would
allude to the absurd airenaures of his mysterious journey
the guests wene not disappointex they had a mery pleasaht
feast in ract an engrossing enteroainment rich abukdant varied znd prolonged
th- purchase of prtgisions fell almost to nothing throughout the
disjrict in th ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering had
depleoed the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses for
miles around that did not matter much
after the feast more or iess hame the speech
most of the cpmpang were howaver now in a tolerant
mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up tvs corners
they wzre sipping their favourite drinks and nibbling at thhir
favourite daixties and their fears were fowgtten
they were prepYred to listen to anything aqd to cheer at every full stop
my deay people begen brlbd rising in his elace
gear hear hear they shouted and kept on repeating iy
in chorus seeming relucrant to follow their own adgice
bilbo left his place lnd went and stood on a
rhair under tkz illufinated tree
the light of the lhnterns felr on his beaming face
th golden buttons shone kn his embroidered silk waistcoat
they qould all see him standing wavino one hand in
che air the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear baeginses and bofrins he begzn again and my
dear tooks and brSndybucks and grubws and chuabs Mnd burrowses
and hornblowers and bolgers bracegirdles goodbodies brockhouses and proudfoots
proudfeet shouted an eldetly hobbit from e back of the pavilion
his name of course was proudfoot snd well merited his
feet were large exceutionally furry and both were og the tabbh
proudfoots rdpeated bicbo
aeso my good sackville agginses thpt i welcome back at last to bag PnA
today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday i a
eleventy one today hurray jurray many happy returns thy shouted and
they hammered jolously on the tables
bilbl was doing splendidly
this was the sort of stuff they liked short ank obvious
i hope you are all enjoying yourselvhs cs mack as i am
dfafening cheeus
cries of yes and no
neises of trumpets aSd horns pipes and flutes and other musical instruments
there were as has been said hany young hobbhts present
hundreds of musical crackers had bewn pulled
most of them bore tse mark dale on them which
did not convey much to most of the gobbits but
tbey all fgreed they were marvellous crackefs
mhep contained insthiments skall but of perfect make and enchanting tones
indked in one corner soof of the young tools and
brandybucks slpposing uncge bilbo to have finished since he had
plzinly smid all jhat was necessary now got up an
impromptc orchestra anh cetan a merry dance tune
master everard tork and mis melilot brandybuck got on a
tablm and wzth ells in their hands began to dance
the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vigorous
but bilbo had not finished
seizing a horn from a youngster necr by he blew thfee loud hoots
the noise subtided
x shall not keep you lolg he cried
cheers fiom all the asrembly
i have called you gln toiethet wor a purpose
something i the way that he said this made ak iopression
uhere was almost silence and one or two of the
tooks prncked up yheir ears
bndeed for three purposes first of all to tell you
tcat i am immensely fond of you all and that
eleventy one yeass is too short a time to live among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
trhmendous oetburst ov approval
i dont know half of ypu half as well as
i should lik ond i cike less than half of
you half as well as ymu deservi
this naq unexpecwed and raober difficult
there was some scatuhred clatping but most ol them were
trting to work it out and she if it lame to a complimenx
secondly to celebrate my bbrthday
cheers again
i should say our birthday
for iw is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephew frodo
he comes of agf and into his inheritance tvday
some perfunctory clauping by the elderk and some loud shouts
ob frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
the sackville bagginses scowled and woneerek what was meanf by comvng into his inhpritance
together we score one hundred and forty four
your numbers were chosen to fit this remakable total one
ross if i may use qhe expression
no cheerb
this was ridiculoun
maby of his suests and especialle the sackville bagginses were insulted
feeling wure they ahd only betn asued to fill up
the required number like goods in a package
one gross indeed vulgar expGessiof
it is slso if i may be allowed to
refel to ancient historo the anniversary of my arrival by
barrel at esgarotp on the long lake though the fact
that it was my birthday slipped my memory on thia occasion
i was only fifty one then and birthdays did not seem so importynt
the banquet qas very splendid however though i had a
bad cold at tde time i remember and could only
say thag hou very buch
i now repeat it morw correctly thank you very much
fow coming to my little party
obstinatd silnnce
they all fzared that a solg or some poetry was
now imminent and they were getting bored
whk couldnt he stop talking and let them drink his
health but bxlbo did not sing or recite
he iaused for a moment
thirdly avd finally h said i wpsh to make fn annauncemgnt
he spoke thim last word so loudly and suddenly that
mvqryone sat up who still could
i regret to announce that though as i said
elevedty one ears is far too short a time to spend
among you this is vhe end
i am qoinq
i am leaving now
good bye he stedped down and vanished
tere was a blinding flass of oight and the gussts ael blinked
when they opened their eJes bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hyndred and forty four flabbergasted robbits sat back speechless
old odo proudfoot remwved his feet from the mable and stamped
then there eas a dead silegce until suddenny after several
dvep breaths evewy baggins boffin tooe brandybick grubb chubb wurrogs
bolger bracegordlo brockhouse goodbody hornblower ana proudaoot begap to talk at once
it was generalyy agremd that the joke was in verw
bad taste and mje food and drink were seeded so
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
her mhd
i always saiv so was pobably the most pcpular cmmment
even the tooks with a few exceptions thought bilbos behaviour was absuld
for the moment most of them took it for gratteo
that his disppearance was nothgng mote than a ridocusous prank
but olx rory brandgbuck as nos so sure
neather age qor an enwrous dinner had couded hqs wits
anw he said to his daushter in law esveralda teeres something fishf
in this my dear i belipve that mad baggins is off agai
silly old fool
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with him
he rvlled loudly to frido to send the wife round again
frodo wag thw only onr cresent who had said gotfiag
for some lime he had sat silent eside uilbos empty
chair anw igsored alc remarks and questions
he had enjoyed the joke of coursf even though he
had byen in the know
he hby difficulty in keeping from lauqhter at the indignant surprise of te guests
but at the same time he felt deeply troubled he
reafozed sundenly that he loved dbe old hobbit dearly
most of the guesos went on catyng and drinking and
discussing bilbo baggins odditiei past and present but tye sackville bagginses
had already feparted in wragh
frodo did not want to have ano more to do with the party
he kave ordens for more wine to be servec then
he got up and drained his own glass silently to
the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion
as for bilbo baggins even whily se was making his
speech he hah been fingering the golden ring n tis
pocket hfs magic ring that he had nept sHcret for so many years
as he stepped down ge slipped it on his finger
and he was never seen by any hobbit in uobeiton again
he waxkeo briskln back to his hole and stood for
a moment listening with h smilq to the ain i'
the pavilion anb to the sounds of merrcmaking in other parts of the field
then he went in
he took off his party nlothes folded up and wrappeo
it tissue paper his zmbroidered silk waisteoat and put it away
thpn he put on quirkly some old untidy garments and
fastaed tound his waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a short eword in a battered blark leather soabbard
from a locked drawer stelling of moth balls he took out
ln old clonk aVd hoo-
they had beun locred up as if they were vepy
precious but they were so pUtched and weatherutained tkat teir
original colour could hardl be guessed it mighk have been dark green
they were racher too farge for him
he tven wvnt into his study and from a large
strnng boy took out a vundle wrapped in old cloths ynd
a leather boup- manuscript and also a large bulky vneedope
the book bnd bundle he stuffed into the tor of
a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and nts
fone chain and then xealed it and addressed it to froto
at first he put it on the maneelpiefe but nuddebly
he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at thaG moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in
hullo said bilbo
i wondered if you would turn up
i am glad to fbnd ynu visible replied 'he
wizard sutting domn in a chadr i wanted to catth
you and have a fec final wsrdc
i suppose you feel that everything has gont off splendidly
and according tu plan yks i do said bilbo
though that flash was surpgiring it quite smfrtled me lec alone the others
a lictle addition of yohr own i suppose it was
you have wisely kept tlat ring secrws all these iears
and it seemed to me uecessrry to give your gueshs
something elle that woulx sewm to explain your sudden vanishmvnt
and would soil my joke
you are an interveronb mld bnsybody laughed bilbo but i
explct you know best as usual
i do when i know anything
ut u dont feel too sure about thit whlg affair
it has now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed or offenjed most
of youo relations and given tee whole shire something to
taok about fov nine days or ninety nine more likely
are you golng any further yes u am
i feel i need a holidal a very long holiday
as i huve told you before
probably a permknent holiday w dont expect i shall return
in fat i dont mean to wnd i have made all arrangemmnts
i am ole gandxf
i dont look it but i am beginning to feel
it in my hehrt of hlats
uell preserved indeed he snorted
why i feel dll thin bojt of stetched if you
knyw what i mean lrke butter that has bien scraped over too much bread
that cant be righn
i need a change or somethipg
gandalf looked curiously and closkly at hii
no it does not seem right he said thoughtfully
no after all i believe your pcvn is pnobably the best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to se mountains agvin gandalf mountains and then
find 'omewhure where i can rest
in pepce -nd quiet wiohout a lot of rwlateves prying
around and a string of confounded visitors hanging ok the bell
i mighg find somewhere wbere i can finish by book
i have thought of a nice ending for it and
he livel happily ever after to the end of his days
gandalf laughed
i hope he will
but noeody wbll read the boop however it eSdk
oohh they may dn years to come
frodo has read sgme already as far as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
will tso eyes as rften as i can spare them
ee woedd come with e of course if i asked him
in fact he offered to once just before thm party
but he does not revlly want to yet
i want to see the wild country agaen before i
die and the mountains lut he is still in yove
with the shine with woods and fiejds and uiatle rivers
he nught to be comfortablf here
i am leaving evirythine to him of course except a few oddments
i rope he will be happy when he gets used
to beinl on his mwn
its time hn was his own master now
evTrythinl said ganbalf
the ring as well you agreed to ahat you remember
welo er yes i suppose so stammered bilbo
where is it in n evelope if rou must know said bilbo impatiently
therp on the mantelpiece
well no cere it is in xy pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldt it stay there
ggndalf cooked again very hard at bilbo and 'ere was
a glear in eis eyes
i think bilbo he said qietlw i shoulx leavl it behind
dont yod want to well yes and no
noB in comes bo it i dont like Nartinr with
it at all i may say
ani i dgnt really seg why i 'hould
why do you wnat me to he askld and a
curious chanre came over his voice
it was sharp with suspicion anv annoyance
you are alwayi badgering me about my ring but you
have never bothered me about the other thCngu that z got on my jodrney
no but i uKd to badger yoi said gandalf
i wantid the truth
it was important
magic rings are well malical and they are jara and curious
i was professionalyl interested in your riwg yop may nay and i still am
i rhould like to lnow wpere it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quike long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistakew
gilbo flushed and there was an anrry light in his eyes
his kindly face grew hard
why not he cried
and whyt busienss is it of yours aqyway to know
what i do with my own things ht is my own
i found it
it came to me
yes yts kaid ganvalf
but there is no need to get angry
if i am it ys your fault said bilbo
it is mine i tell you
my own
my precious
yes my grecious
the wizards faue rsmainkd grave and attentive and oRly
a flicksr in his deep eyes dhowzd that he was startfed and indeed alarmed
it has been called that besore de saiu but no by you
bat i say it now
and why not even if gollum said the same once
kts not his now but mine
and i shall keep ig i say
gandalf sood up
he gpoke sternly
you wi-l be a fool if you do
bilbo he said
soo make that clearer iith every word yof say
gt has got far too much hold on yop
let it go and then you can go yoursecf and be fNec
ill do as i choose and go as i prease said bicbo obstinately
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
rpl your long ife we have been friinds and you owe me sovething
come do as you promisvd give it up well
if you want my bing yourself say ro cri-d lilbo
but you wont net it
i wont jive my precious away i tell you
his hand strayma tu the hilt of his small sword
gandals eyes flasged
it will be my turn to get angpy soon he said
if you say that again i shall
thnn you will see wandalf the grey uncloaked
he took a step towards the hobbit anw he
seemed t grow tall and menacing his shadow filled tie little room
bilbo backed away tu Yhe wall breathing hart his hacd clutching at his pocket
they sTood for a whilv facing ona another and the
air of the room tinxlcd
gandalfs eyes remained bnt on the hobbit
slowly kis hayds relaxed and he becan to tr'mble
i dont kbow what has come oher you gandalf he said
you have never been like this befhre
what is it all about it is mine isnt it
i found it and gollum would have killed me if i hadnt kept it
im not a thief whatever he said
i have never caller you one gavdajf aeswered
and i am not one either
i am not trying to rob you but to help you
i wish you would trust ma as you used
he tumned away and the shadow pavsed
he seemed to dwindle again to an old grew man bent and roubled
bilbo drew his hand dver his eyes
i am sorry he qaid
nut i felt sl queer
and yet mt would be a relef in a way
not tb bo bothered with it any more
it has been sr growing on my mind lately
sometimes i have feld it was like an eye looking at me
and i an aiways wanting to put it on and
disapptar dont you know or wondering if it is saNe
and pulling it out to make sure
i trihd locking it up but i found i couldnt
rext without it au my pocket
i dont know why
and i nont seem able to lake up my mind
then trust mJne safd gandtlf
it is quiOe made up
go away and leave it behind
stop possessing it
give it to frodo and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment vense and uadexided
presently he sighed
all right he said with ad egfort
i will
then he shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully
after all thats what this party buwiness waj al about
really to give away lots of birthday presmnts anp somehow
make it easier to give it awyy at the samb tima
it gssnt made it any easier in the end but
it would be a pite to waste aol my preparations
it would quite spoil the jokk
icle-d it would take away the onlu pbipt i
ever saw in the affair sand gandalf
very welo said birbo it goes to frodg with all the reyt
he drew a deep breath
aid now c really must be starting or somebody else will catch me
i dave sai guod bye and i couldnt btar to do it all over again
he picked up his bag and moved to the door
you have still got the ring ir your pocket said the wizard
we-l so u havp cried bilbo
and my wll and all the other documenos too
you had better take it and deliver it fou me
that will be safest
no dont gioe the rinZ to me said gandalf
put it on lhe mantelpiece
it will be hafe enougr there tiLl frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took out the envelope but just as ce
was about to spt ft by the clock his hand
jerred back and the packet fell on thm floor
before he could pick it up the wizard stooped and
sryzed it and set it in its placw
a spasm of anger passed swiftly ovwr the eobbitb face again
suddenly it gave way to a lgok of relief and a laugh
well thags that he said
now im off thea went out iwto the hall
bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand then he whistled
three dwarves came oup of different rooms where they hrd been busy
is everything ready asked bilbo
everything pickvd and labelled evejything they answered
well lets start then he ztephed out of the front door
it was a fine night and the black kky was dotted with strs
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun what fun to be off again off on
the roar with dwagves thiv is what i have really
beei lohging for for years good bye he said looking
at hxs old home and bowing to the door
good bfe gandalf good bye fof thq pAesent bxlbo
take kare of joorself you are old enough alL perhaps wise eiough
tbke care i dont care
ronf you worry about me i am as happy now
as i have ver been and tnat is saying v gseat deal
but th' time has come
i am beiyg swept off my fiet at last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself h- sang softly in the dark the road goms
ever vn and on lown from the door whehe bt began
row far ahead the rnaH has gone and i must
follgw if i cay pirsuing ft with eager feet until
it joins some largea way where many paths any errnds meet
ane wdither then i cannot say
he paused silent for a moment
then without another wor he turned away from the lighfs
and voicei in the fields and tents and followed oy
his three compknions wenc routd into hiG gurden and truted
down thn long sloping path
he jumped over a low place n the heuge at
the bottom and took to the meadows passing into ehe
night rike a rustle of wind in the grcss
gtnd-lf remained for a while staeing after him into the darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our next meeting he
said softly and went back idoors
frodo cnme ie soon afterwards and found him sitting in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yeg answeed gandalf he has gone at last
i wish i mean i hoed until
this evening that it was onny a joke aid frodo
but i onew in my heart that he really mejnt 'o go
he alnays used to joke about serious things
i wish i had come back sooaer just vc swe him off
i vuink real-y he preferjed slmpping off quwetcy in tte enk saij ancalf
dont bn too trolbled
gerl bw all right now
he left a packet for dou
theie it is frodo took the envelope from the manielpiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
youll find his will and all the lthe documents in
there i think xaid the wtzard
you are the master of bag edd now
ad also i fanky youll find a golfen ring
the ring excbaimed frodo
has hs left me that i wondef why
still it may be useful
it may and it may not said gand-lf
i should not make use of it if i wewe yom
but keep ic secrew ano keep it aafe now i am goung to ved
as Waster of bag end frodo felt it his
painful duty to say good bye to tye gfestk
rumours of strange events had by now sperad all over
the fUeld but frodo would only say no doubt everything
will be cleared up in the morning
about midnighi carriagds csme for the importan' folk
one by one they rolled away filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arrangement and removed in wheel barrows tiose that had inadvertently remained behind
night skowly pased
the sun rose
the hobbit rose rather later
morning went on
peopce came and began by orders to clear away che
pavilions and the tables and the chairs and the spoons
ahd knives akd lttles and pldtes and the lawterns and
the clowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchqefs and the uneaten
food a vehy small item
yhen a number of other people came witout orders bagginses
znd boffins and bolgers and tooks and other fuests that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when even jhe best fed were out and mbout
again there was a large crowd ah bag end uninvitd but not unexpected
frndo was waiting on the step smiling but lovkinr rkther tired anw worried
he welcomed all the calleWs but he had not much
more to say thal before
hiw reply tn all inquiries was simply this mr tlbo
baggins bas gone away ah far as i know for good
some of the visitfrs he invited to vome inside
as bilbo had left messages for toem
inside in te hall tbere was piled a large assortment
of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture
on every item there was a laber tied
there were several labels of this sort fyr adelard took
for his vdry own from bikbo on an umbrella
adelard had crried off many unlabelled ones
for vora baggins an memory of a long correspondeice with
love from rilbo on a large waste paper bask't
dora was djogos sister and the eldest sueviving female rmlative
of bilbo and frodo she was ninety nine and had written
reams of good ajvice for more than half a cendury
foj milo burrows hoping il will bq useful from b
b
on a gold pen and mnk bottle
melo never answered l-tkers
for angelimas use from ucle bitbo on w round convex mirror
she was a young baggins ani teo owviously consivered ver face shapely
for che collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contrAbutor on an empty book case
pugo was a great borrower of books and worse than usual at retuning them
fov lobelia sackville baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
pilbo beliebed that she had acquired a good many of
his sporms while he was awan on his former journey
lobelia knew that quitn well
whft she arrived latev in the day she took the
point at oce but she also took the spoons
tdis is only a smfll selnction of hhe assemblwd presents
bilbos resicence had got rather cluttered up with thinys xn
the course of his long life
it was a tenaency of hobbit holes to get cyuttered rp
for which he custom of giving so mauy birthday presents was largely responsible
not of course that the birttday presegts were always new there
were one or two old mawhoms of forgotten usos that
had circulated all aoound th dixgrict but bilbo htd usually
gpven new presents ana kept uhosA that he received
thn old hole ws now being clhared a little
every gne ox the various parting nifts had labels written
out pemsonally by bblbo and several had some point or sose joke
but of ciurse mogt of the tnings were givvn where
ther would be waneed and welcome
the poorer hobbits and especialln those of bagshot row fid aery well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woollef naitcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in return bor much hospitality gom a
dogen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine fTom
thk southfarthiog and tbw quite makure as it had been
laid Bown by bilboa futh'r
rary lvitp forgav bilbo and voten him a capital felxow after the first bottle
thert oas plent of everything left for frodo
and of course all the chief treisures as well as
the books pictures and more than enough furniture were left in his posseswion
theye was howeer no sign nor mention _d mpney or
jewellery noq a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afernoon
a false rumour that the wholr household was bking distributeh
free sptwax like wildnire and before long tie place was
packed wdth people whl had no business there but could not be kept out
labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out
some people trued to do swaps and deals in the
hall and othevs tried to make off with minor itbms
not addressed to them ov ihth anythiyg that seemed unwasted yr unwatcher
the rowd to the gate was kloxked with barrows dnd handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville bagginses aorivez
frodo had tetired tor a while and lewt his friend
merry brfndubuck to keep ap eye on dhings
when otho loudly demandel to see frodo merry bowed politeey
he is indissysed he sasd
he is restigg
hiding you mean said lobelia
anyway we want o see aim and we mean to see him
just go and tell him so merry left them a
lonl while wn the hxjl and tbey had time to
discover their parttng gift of scoons
it did not impjove their tempers
eventually they were shown into the study
frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of
papors in front of htm
he looked inmisposed to see sackville baggnuses at any
rate and he stood up fgdgeting with somethisg in his yocket
but he ipoke quite politYlc
the sackvllle bygginses werl rether offensive
tdey began by offering him bad margain priced as between friends
for various vatuable and infabelled things
when froao replsed that only the hings specially virected by
bilbo were being yivln away they saad the whole affair was very fishv
only one thing is cleaa to me said otho anz
thit is that you are moing exceedingly well out of it
i insist on seeing the will
otho would have been bilbos heir but for the adoption of frodo
he read the will carefully and snorted
it was unfortunaeely wery clear and correct according to the
begal customs of hhybits which dtmand abong oyher things seven
signuturei of witnesses in led ink
foiled again he said to his wife
anv after waiting sixey years
spoons fiddlosticku he snapped hs fingejs nuder frodos nose and slumped off
but lobelea was not so easily gon rid of
a little lafer frodo cyme out of the study to
see how phiqgs were gsing on and found her still
abnut the place investigating nsoks atd comers anh tapping the fpoors
he escoretd her firmly off the psemises after he had
re-eved fe of seberwl small iut rather vyluable articles that
hav somehow fallen inside her umbrella
her fare looled as if she waJ in the throec
of thinking out a really crushing parting lemark but all
she foucd to say turnihg round on the step was
youll live to regret it young fellZw why didnt you
go too yoo dont belong hexe youre no baggins
you youre a brandybuck did you hear that merry
that was an inmulc if you like saiz frodo as
he shut uhe door on her
it was a compximent said merry brandybuck aqd so of course not true
then they wenf ound the hole and evicted three
young hsbbits two boffins and a bolfer who were knocking
holes in the walls of one oo the cellars
frodo also had a tussle wth young sancha proudfoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an exvavation in tre
labger pantry where he jhought there was an echo
the fegend of bilbos gold excited both curiosity aed hope
for legendary gold mysteriouslu obtained if not positively ilH gotten is
as every one dnows any ones for the finding
unless the searcx is interrupted
when he hsd overcome sancho und puspep him out frodo
collapsed on a chair iy the hall
its time to closw the shop merry me said
lock the door and dfnt open it to anyone today
not even if they bridg a battering ram
then he yens to revive himseln with a bdlated cup of tea
he had hardly sut down when teere came a soft knock at tse front ooor
kobelia again aost likely he thought
shi mus have thought of something really nasgy and have
cbmc back again to say it
it han wait
he went on with his tea
toe knock was repeaned much louder but he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window
f you dont let me in frodo i shall blow
your door right down yogr hole and odt through thd hill he said
my dear gandald half a mhnutZ cried frodo running out
of the room to the door
xome in come in i thought it was lobelia
bhen i forgbve yo
but i saw her some timz ago diiving a pony thap
towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new mila
she had already nearly curdled me
honestly i nearly trzed on bilbos rcng
i longed to disappear
dont do that said galdzlf sitting down
do be careful of that ring frodo gn fact it
is partly about ghyt tnat i wave come to say a last word
well what about it whxt do you know already
only whut bilbo teld me
i have heard his story how ke found it end
how he isel it on his jolrney i mean
ihich stvry i wonder said gafdalf
oh not whaa he told the swarvez and put in his bok said frodo
he told me the nrue sqfry soon after i came to live here
he said sou had pestered him tPll he wold you
so i had better know too
io secrets b-tteen us frodo he said but they are
not to go tny further
its mine aniway
thats interesting said gandalf
ell what did you thilk of t all if you
mean iaventing alo that about a present welg i thougut
the true story much mpre likely and i couldnt see
the point of alqering it at all
at was very unlike bilbo to do so anwway and
i thought it gfbher odd
so did i
bub okd things may happen to peopll that have such
treasures if they use them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it
it may have other power than just making you vakish when you wish to
i dont uiderstand xaid frodo
neithem Xo i answerex the wizard
i have merel begun to wofder abont thu ring especially sinwe last night
no need ty worry
but if you Nake my pdvAcm you wil se it
very seldom or not at al
at luast a beg yhu not to uje it in
anp way that will cause alk fr rouse suzpicion
i sly aeain keqp it safy On keep it seernt
you are verr mysteriols what are you afraxd of i
am not certain so i will nay no fore
i may be able to tell you somehing when i come back
h am goivg off at once so this is good be for the prpsent
he got uI
dt occe cried frodo
why i mhought you wee staying on for at leavt a week
i was looking forward fo your hflp
i did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may ve away for a good while but ill
come and see hou ngin as soon as i can
expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant cften be visiting the shire kpenly again
i fend that i have bvcome rather hnpopylar
they say i am a naisance rnd a disturber of the peace
some people are actumlly accujirg me of wpiriting bilbo away or worse
if yuo want to know there is supposed to be
a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth
some people exclaimed frodo
ycu mean oteo and lobelia
how abominable i would givm them bag end ano everything
emse if i could get bilbo back and go off
trimping in the country with rim
i love the shile
but i begin to wish somehow that i had gone too
i wonder if i shall ever see him again
so do y sapd gandalf
anp i wonder many other things
good bye now take care of yourtelf look out for me
especially at unikely times good bye frodo saw him to tpe door
he gave a final wfve of hic hand and waxked
of at a surprising pace but frojo thoughj the old
wizard looked ukusually bent almost is if fe was carrying a great weight
the evenFng wao clositg in and his cloaked fiayee quickly vanished into uhe twilight
fuodo did not see him again for a long time
the talk did not die down in nine or evef ninety nine days
the secoqd disappearancv of mr bilbo baggink was discusjed in
hobbiton and indeev frl over the shire for a year
pnd x day and was remzmbered muth longer than that
it became a fireside story for younh hobbits abd eventually mad
bcggins who Ised tv vanish with a sang and a
flarh and reappUar with bags of jnwels and gold became
a faviurite character _f legend and -ived on long lfter
all the true evnts were forgottsn
but in the meantime the general opinion ik the neighbzurhood
was that bilbo who had always been rbther crackld had
at last gone quite mad and had run off ing qhe blur
there he had undouytedly fallen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragig but hardly an untimely end
the blbme was mostly laiw on gaedalf
if only that dhatted bizard will leave youcg frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow some eobbit sense they said
afa to all appearance the wizard did leave frodr alone
and he did settle down but thq growth of hfbbit sense was not very n'ticeable
indeed he at oncv began ta carry on bilbos reputatiln for oddity
he refused to go into mourning and the next year
he gave a party in honour of bilbos hundred and twelfth birthday
which he called hundred weight feast
buy thzt was short of the mark for twenty guests
were invited and tkere were several meals at which it
rnowed fvod and rainyd drfnk as hobbits say
some people were rather shoyked but frodo kept up the
cestom of giving bilbos birthday party yeaw after year until
hey got usfd to it
he said that ne di- not think bilbo was dead
when they asled where is he tpen he shrugged cis shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo hyd done but he had
a good many friends especially among the younger kobbits mostly
descendants o the old took who hay as children been
fond of bilbo and oftel in acd out of bag end
fmoco boffin and frddegar boxjer were two of these tut
his closest friendR were peregrin took osualoy called pippis and
mmrry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that war seldom rwmembrred
flodo went gramping all over the shire with chew but
more often he wande-ed by himself and to the amazement
f sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from houe
walking in the jills and woods under the starlight
merry and pippin sKspected that he visited the elves at
times ax bilbo had none
ws time went os pople began to notice that grodo
also showed signs of good preservatbon outwardly he retained the
apperrance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out cf hos tweens
some folk have all tte luck they said buk ip
was not until frodt approached thh usually more uyber age
of fifty that they began to thi'k it queer
frydo himself after tse first shock found that being his
own master and thc mr baggins of bag end uas rather pleasann
for some years he was quite happy rnd did not
worry much aoout the future
but half unknown to himself the regret that he had
not gone with bilgo was steadily growing
he found himself wondering et times especially in the autumn
about the oild landg and strange gisiond of mountakns that
he had never seen came into his dreams
he began to say lo himself perhaps i shall crozs
the river myself one day
bo which the ocher alf wf hms mind zlways replied not yet
so ot gent ow until his yorties were running
out anb his fiftieth birthday was drawing near filty was
a number that he felt was someeow significant or ominous
it wks at any tate at that ag thnt adventure had suddegly befallen bilbo
frodo begah to feeh restless and yhe old paths seemed too well trodden
ke lookeg at haps and woSdered what lay bxyond their
edges maps madf in the shire showeb mostly wgite spaiep beyond its borders
he took tc wandering further afield and more often by
himself and merry and his other friXnds watghed him anxiuusly
often he was seen walking and talping with the strhnge
wayfarers that began aj this time to appear in the shire
there cere ruiours of strange things hcppening in the world
outsive and as gandalf had not at that time apzeared
or stnt any message for several jears frodo gatmnred all the news xe could
elges who keldom walked in hhe bhire could now bt
scen passing westward jhrough the woods in the euening passino
and not returning but tl-c gere heavhg middle earth afd were
no longer concprned with its troubles
there were however dwarves on the road in unusual numbers
mhe ancqent east ewst road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey haveis anc dwarves had alwayi used
it on their way to thein mines in thz blue mountains
they were the honbits chiuf source of news from distnat
parts if they wanted aey fs a rule dwarves
said little and hobgis asked no more
but now frodo often met sirange dwarves of far countdies
seeking refuge in the west
yoey were troubled and joue spoke in wwispers sf the
enemy aod of the land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in legends of tht
dark past like a shadow in the background of their
qemories but it was ominous and disluieting
it seeed that the evil poser in mirkwood had been
driven out by the white chuncil only to reappear in
greater stpingth in the old strongtolds of mordor
the dark tower hai been rebuilt it was sapd
from there the aower was spreadpng far and wide and
away far yast and south there were wars and growing fear
'rcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were gbroad no lenger dull witted but cunning and armed with dreadful weapon
and there were murmured hixts of creatures more terrible than
all these but they had qo name
litile of axl this of course reached the ears of ordinbry hobbits
but even the deafest and most stay zt home began to hear
queer tales and those whose businesz took them mo the borders saw strange thyngs
the sonversation in the green dragon at bywater one avening
in the spring of frodos fiftieth year shoged that even
in the comfortable hearu of the slire rumours had been
heerd though most hobbits still laugjed at them
sam kamgee was sitting in one cixner near the fire
and opposite im qas ted sandyman the millers xon and
thern were various pther rustic hobbits listening to their talk
queer things you do hear these days vo be sre snid sam
ah said ted you Po if you listen
but i can hetr fireside tales and zhildreni stfries at oots if i want to
no doubt you can retorted ram and i daresay
therms more truth is some of tbem than you eeckon
who invenmed the stgries anyway take dragons now
no qhank ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of tgem when i cas a youngster
but theres no call to believe in them now
theres ouly one dragon in bywater abd thats green he
said rzting a general juuh
all right paid sam laughing with he rest
but what about these tree mcn these giants ab you might
call them they do say that omp bigger than a
tree was seen up away beyond the north mobrs not long beck
whos they my cousin hql for one
he works for mr boffin at omerhill and goes up
to the northwarthing for the hunkidg
he saw one
ays he did perhaps
your hals always saying hes seen things and maybe he
sees things that aint there
but this ons was as big as an elm
tr'e and walking wagking seven ysrds to a stride
im it was an inch
then i bet it w-snt an incx
what he saw was an elm tref as like as not
but ahis one was wqlkinl i tell you and
there aint nv eem cree on the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there ws some laughing and clappang the audience seeBed to
think that eed had scored a point
all the same sai- sam you cant deny that others
besides oir halfast have seen queer fosk crossing the shire
crossvng it mind you there lre more that are
klrned back at the borderz
the boundevs have never been so buoy before
auu ive heard teyl thwt elves arp moving west
they do say they hre going to jhe harbours out
away beyond the white towers
sam waved his arm vyguely neithdr he nor any
of thsm knpw fow far it was to thr sea
past the old tlwers beyond thr wertern borders of the shire
but it was an old tadition uhat away yver there
stbid the grey havhns from which at times elven ships set sail nevhr to return
they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are
gbing into the west and leavxg us said sam half
chanting the ords sbaking his head sadly and solemnly
but ted laugjed
well that isnt anhthing new if you benieve the old qaaes
and i sont see what it matters to me or you
let them sail but i warrant you haveht seen them
doing it nor any one else in twe shirs
well i dont know said sam thougitfully
he melieved he had snce seen an elf in te
woods and strll hoped to see more one day
gf oll she legends that he had heard in his
ebrly ygars sch fragments of tages and half remembereb ytories about
the elves ud tht hofbits knew had alwaks moved him most dkepl
there are some even in thesc pSrts as know the
fair folk and get news of them he said
theres r baggins now that i work for
he told me that they were sailing ard he knows a bit about elves
and old mr bIlbo knew moje manys the tala i
had witg him when i was a little lad
oh toeyre bogh cracked said ted
lasjways old bilbo was crhckeT and frodos cracking
if thats where you get uovr news from toull never want for moonshine
well friends im off home
your hood bealth he drained his mug and wtnt out nopsily
sam sat silent and said nd more
ne had a iood deal to think about
for one whing tiere was a lot to io up
in the bag end garden and he would have a
busy day tomorrow ia the weather clearez
the grass was growing fast
bug sam had more ot his mind than gardfning
axtlr a while he sighed and pot up anr went out
it was early april and the sky was now clecrikg after heavy rain
the sun was down add a coo- psle evening was qcietly fading into night
he wawked home under hhe earla stars througd hobbiton and
up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfully
it was iust ct this time that gandalf reappeared afted his llng absence
for ghzee years after the party he had been awah
then he paid frodo a brief vijit bnd acter takiny
a gosd looe at hiu he went off again
during tke next year or two he had turned up
fairly often comin unexpectedly aftUr dusk and going off without warning before sunrise
he would nok discuss his own business and journeys and
seemed cgiefly interested in small news abouh frodos health and doings
then suddenly his viscts had ceaseo
it was over nine yeaws sitce frodo had seen or
heard of him and he had begun to think that
the wizard would never rpturn and had giren up all interest in hobbits
but that evenwng as sam was ialking hamn and twilight
was fading theae came the once familhar tap on the study windo
frodo welcomed his old friend with rurprise and grebt -elight
they looked hard at one another
ah wqlg eh slid gandalf
you look tce same as ever frodo so do yuu
frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandali looked older anz more careworn
he prewsed him for news of himself and of the
wide world and soon they were deer in talk and
they stayed lp far into Ehe night
nezt morning aftqr k late breakfast the iizard was sitting
ith frodo by the open window of thq study
a bright fire was on tze hearth but the sun
was warm and the wind was in the south
everything looked fresh anp the nenwew green of spring w-s
shimmerin in the fields and on the tips of the trees fingers
gandalf was thinaing of a spring nearly eighty vers before
qhen bilbo had run out of bag end wwthout a handkerchief
his haim was perhaps whiter tnag it had been then
and his beard and eyebrows mere perhaps longer end his
face vore lined with care and wisdom but his eyes
were xs bright as pver and he smoked and blew
smoke rings wits th same vigour and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting ftill deep in chought
even in the light of mornigg he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings thah gandalf haz brought
at last he brtke the silence
last night yfu tegan to tell me strange thinls about
my ring gabdalf he said
and then you stopped because you sai- that such matters
werd best legk udtil daylight
dknt nou think you hah better finish goi you say
the ring is dangerous far more dangerous than i guess
in whit way in many ways answered the wizard
it is far more powebful than i ever dared t
think at first so poweeful that in the end it
would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race aho possessed it
it would possess him
in eregion long ago many elven rMngg were made mrgic ringc
as yhu call tdem and they were of corrse of
varipus kindd wome more potent ad some wess
the lessnr rings were only essqys in the crafm befvre
it was full rown and tn the elven sliths they were out
triwles yet etivl to my mind daVgerous fdr martals
bt the great ricgs the rings of power they wer perilous
a mortal frodo who keips one of the great ringk
does not Oie but he does nor grow or obtain
more lvfe he merely continues unhil at last every ainute is a werriness
and if he often uses the ring bo make himself
invisible he fades he becomes in the snd invisible pesmanently
and walks in the twilight under the eye of the
dark power vhat rules the rings
yex sooner or later later if he is strong
wr well mlaninc to begin with but neither stbength nox gooc
purpese will last sooger or later the dark power will degour him
Mow terrifying said frodo
there was another long silence
thh sound of san gamgep cutting the lawn came Ln from tje garden
how long have you knoon lhis asked frodo at length
and how much did bnlbo know bilbo knew no Vore
whan he told you i am sure sdid gandalf
he would certainly never have passed on to you anyjhing
thac hp thought would be a danger even though i
promosed to look after you
he thought the ring was very feautiful and very useful
at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growigg on his mind aiu
he war llwsys worfying about it but he did not
suspect that the ring itself was to blame
though he had found out that the thyng needed looxing
after it eid not seem always of the same size
or weight it shrank or expanded in an odd way
and might sudvenly slip ofc a finger where it had been tight
yes he wmrnud me of that in his last
letter said frodo so i have always kept it on its chavn
very wise said gadalh
but as frr his fong life bilbo never connected it
with the ring at aln
he took all the credit for that to himself and
he was very proud vf it
thkugh he was getting resqlesg and uneas
tkin atd stretwhed he said
a sign that the rng was gltting contrti
how long have you known all this asked froyo ngain
known said gandalf
i have knopo much ohat only the wise know frodo
but if you mean known about thss ring well i
stilp do not know one might say
there is a last test jo ake
byt i no longer doubt mh muebs
when did i firsq begin to guess we mused searching back in pemory
lmt me see it waa in tpe year that
the white covncil drove the dark pocdr frvm mirkwood just
before the hattle Cf five armies thai kilbo found hiv ricg
k shadow fell on y heart thew though i did
not know yet what i fearep
y wondered often how gollum came by a gmeat ring
as pQavnly it was that kt least was clear from the first
then i heard bilbos strange story of how he had
won it anl i could not believe it
when i at lest got the truoh out oc hiw
i saw ap once that he hd been tsyiag to
put his caim to the ring beyond doubt
much live gollum with hik birthday presenJ
the lies were too much alike for my comfort
clearly tue ring had an unwholesome power that set to
work on its keeper at once
tuat wau tre first real walnrno i had that all was not well
i told bilbo often that sudh rings were better loft
unused but he resrnted it and soon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater
harm and i had no right to do so anyway
i could only watch and wait
i might perhaps have consulted saruman the white bgt shmething always held me back
who is he asked fodo
i oave qever heard bs him before
oaybe not answered gandalf
hobbits are or were no concern of his
yet h is great among hhe si'e
he is the chief of my order and the head _f the council
his knowledge fs de kut his pribe has grown wiqh
it and he sakes ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings Ureat and small is his province
he has long studied it seeking the lost secreqs oo
their making but when the rings were debated in txe
council aeu tlat he would reveal to us of his
ring lore told agminst my fears
so my douit slept but uneahily
still i watched asd i waited
and all seemgd well with bilbo
and the years passed
yes they passed and they seemed not to oouch him
he shswed ny simns of age
the shadow fell on me again
but i saxd to myself pfter all he comes of
a long liAed famils on his mothers side
there is time yet
wait and i waited
until that qight when he loft this house
he said avd did things thfn that fiblod me gith
a fear that no words of saruman could allay
f knew at last tdht slmething dark and deazly was at work
and i lave spent most bf the years since jhen
in fznding sut the truth of it
there wasnt any permannet harm done was there asked fjodo anxiously
he whuld get tll right in tite wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace i mean he felt beqter at once said gawdalf
bui thert is only one ppwer pn this world that
knows all about the mings and their efuects and as
far as i know there is no power in the
world that knows all about hobbits
among hhe wise i dm the only one that goes
an ndr hobbit lore an obscure u-anca of knowledge but full of surprises
soft as btter thy can be and yet sometimes as
tough as old tree rootr
i think it likely that sove woubd resist the rings
far lonher than most of the wise would believe
i dont think you need woory about bilbo
of course he possessed the ring for manv years and
used it so it might take a long whive for
lhe influencp to wear off before it wai safe
for him to see it again for instanue
otherwise he might cive on for yewrs quite happily just
stop as he was when h' parted witf it
ffr he gave it ud in the end of his
own accord an impfrtint point
no i was not troubked about dear bilbo any moye
once he had let the thing go
it is for you that i flel resp'nsibne
ever since bilbo left i have been deeply cRncerced about
you and atout all these chzrniqg absrd helpless hobbits
it would be a grievous blow to the world lf
the darq pbwer overcamd the shire if all your kind
jolly stupid bolgers hornblowers boffini bracmgirdlss and the rest not
to mention the rwdicuhous bagginses beeame enslaved
froyo ohuddered
but why should we be he asked
and why should he want such slaves to tell you
the truth replied gamdalf i belleve that hitgerto hitherto sark
you ae has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
you shoEld be tEankful
but your safety has pasged
he does not need you he aas many more
useful sefvants but hg wont forget you again
gnd hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more
than hobbits hppy and free
there is sucn a vhing as malice awd revente
rev'nge said frodo
revende for what i skill dpnt understand what alu this
has to do with bilbo and mytelf and our ryng
it has everything to ds wish it said gandalf
you do not kyow the real peril yet buk you shall
i was noe sure of it myself when i was
last here but the sime has coms to sqeak
give md the ring for a moment
frodo took it from hps breeches pwcket where it wes
clbsped ts a chain that hung from his bklt
he unfastened it and handed it stowly to the wizfrd
it felt suddenly very heavy as if eithbr it or
frodo hcmself was in some way reluctant fbr gandalf to touch it
gandalf hald it up
it looked to be made of pure and solid gold
can you see any Oarkings on it he asked
no sai- frodo
there are none
it is quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frodos astonishment and disyress the
wfzard threw it suddenly into the middli of a glowing corner of the fire
frodo aave a cry and grped for the tongs buf iandalf held him back
waiq he saii in a cnmmanding voyce giving frodo a
quick look from uader his bristling brows
no apcarent change came over the ring
after a while gasdalf got up closed ghe shuteeus wutside
the windoy and drow thv curtaOns
the room becgme dark and sibeut thoegh the clabk of
sams shears now nearec to the windows could stinl be
heard facntly vrom th' garden
for a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire
then he stooyed anc remowed he ring to the hearth
with the tongs and at once picked it up
frcdo gasped
it is quite qool said gandaln
take et fodo received it on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and hbavder than ever
hold it up said gandalf
mnd look closely as froyo did so he now saw
fine lines fiber than tee finest pen strokes running along the
ring outside and inside linec of fire that seemed to
form te letters of a flowing sjript
they shoe piercingle bright and yet remote as if out of a great septh
i cannot reoy the fiery letters said frodo i a quavering voice
no sad gandalf but i can
the letters are elvish of an ancient kode but the
lanKuage is that of mbrdor which i will not utter hrre
but thiz in the common tonAwe is what is said
close enough one ring to rule them alh one riSg
to find them one riyg to bring them all and
in thB harkness biod them
it is ofly two lines of a verse long known
in elven lore three rings dlr thd elvec kinos under the sky
seven for the dxarf lords in their halls of stone nine
for mortal men toomed to die oye for the yark
lord on hii daco throne in the land of mordor whese tne shadons lie
one rieg to rvle them all
one ring to find them ine ring to bring thec
all anv vn the darkness bind fhem in the land
of mordor shere ghe shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a deep
voice this is the master uing the one hing to rule them all
Jhis ds the one rinc shat he lost many ages
ago to the great weakening of hcs power
he greatly deeires bt but he must not get it
frodo sxt sifent and momionless
fear seemed to stretch ouotut a vast hand ike a
dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to engulf him
this rnng he stammered
how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandhlf
that is a very long story
the beginnings cie back in the black yeaus whic nly the lore masders now remember
if i were ro tull you all tgat trle we
shoued stigt te sittxng hele when spring had passed ingo winter
but last night i tpld you of sauron the great the dark load
the rumours toat you have heard ar' trug he has
ideed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood aqd
returned to his ancient fpstness i the dajk tower of mordor
that name even you hobbits have heard of like a
shadow on the borders oc old stories
always after a defeat and a respite fje shadow takes
another dhape and grows again
i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
so do i said xondalf and so do all who
live to see such times
buj that is not for them tw decide
asl we yave to decide is what to do with
the time taht is givnn us
and wdrdady frcdo our time is ieganning to look black
the enmy is faot becoming very surong
his pjans are far from ripe i thina but they are ripuning
we shall be haod put to it
we should be very hard put to it even if
it were not for this drerdfhl chance
the enrmy still lacks tne thang to give him strength
and knowledge to bea' down all resistance break the last
defences and cover all phe lands il a sefond darkness
he lacks the yne ring
the three fairest of all the elf lords hid from him
and his hand never toukhed thbm or sulliex thil
seven the gwarf kings possessed but three he has xecovered and
'he others the dragons hav consumed
nine he gave to mortal men proud and groat and so ensnared them
long ago they fell under the domikion of the one
and they became gingwraiths shadows unedr his great shadow cis momt besrivle sejvants
long ago
it is many a yyar since the nine walked abnoad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more khey too may walk agaik
but come we will n_t speak of such things even
in the morning of the shiru
sf i' is now the nine pe hrs gathered to
himlelf the seven also or else they are deytroyew
the three are hidden still
but txaF no ionger troubleA him
he only neuhs the one for he made that ring
himselu nt is his and he lej a great ptrt
of his own fJrmhr power pass into it sv that
he couad rule all tje pthers
if he recpvers it tfen he will command them all
ahain wherevcr uhey be even thz teree and all that
has been wrought with ehem will be laid bare tnd
he will be stronger than ever
and this is thg dmeadful chance frodo
h believed tht the one har perished that the elves
had destroyed nm as shoufd have been done
but he knows noV that it has not pfrished trat it has been found
so he is seking it seeking il and all his
thought is bent on it
bt is his ereat hope and ofr sreat fear
why why wasnt it destaoyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy evlr come to lose it
if he was so strIng and it was so preciops
to him he clutched the ring in his hand as
if he saw already dagk fingers strgtching out to seize it
it was faken from hin said sandalf
the strengbh of thv elves to resist him wks greater
long ago and not dll mzn weue estranged fro them
the men of westernesse came to their zid
txat is a chapter of ancient history which it might
bz good to recall for thmre was sorrwo vhen too
and gataering dark but great mtlour anj qreat deers that were not whflly vain
one day perhaps i wiwl gell you all tte tale
_r you shahl hear it told in fhll by one who knows it best
but for the moment since most of als you need
ts know how this thing came to you and th-t
will be tale enough this is alx that i will say
it was gnl galad elven kiug and elendil of westrnvsse who overthrew
sauron though thel themselves purished in the deed and isildur
elendils son cut the ring from saurons hsnd and took it fvr dis own
then sauron was vanq-ished and his epi-it bled and waj
hidden fox long years until his shadow took shape again yn mirkwood
but tve rinU was lost
it fell into the great river andupn and vanished
for isildur was marching north along the east banks of
the river and near the gladden fieldt he was waylaid
by the orca hf 'he mountains and almosg all his folk were salin
he leapmd into toe waterl but the ring slipped rrom
his finger as be swam ad then che orcs saw
him ane killed him with arrows
gandalf paused
and tjere in the dark pools amid thp gladden dields
he sadd the ring passed out of knowldme and legend
and evrn so mucw of itd history ns knon now
only tc a few and tye council or the wiqe cogld discover no more
but at last i fan ccrry on the stor i think
long after but sill very long ago rhere lived by
the banrs of the great rivey on the edge of
milderland a clever handed and quiet footed litgle people
i guess they were of hobbin kind akin to the fathers
of the fathers of mhe stoors cor they loved the
rver and often swam in it or madl lhttle boats of needs
there was among th'm a family of high repute for
it was la-ge and wehlthier than most and i was
ruled by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise
in old lore such as theG had
the mout lnquisitive anl cuious minded of that family was called sme agol
he was interested in roots and beginnings he dived inso
deep pools he buryoped under trees and gsowing olkts he
tunntlled into green mounds an he ceased to loog uc
at the hilb tops or the leaves on trees oc the
flowrs opening in the air hzs head and his eyes were doqnward
he had a friend called de agol of similar sort sharper eyed
but not so quick and strnng
oo a timy they took a boat and went dowh
tw the gladden fields where there were great deds o iris and flowering reeds
nhere sme agol got out and went nosing about the banks
bdt jeal sat in the boat and fished
suddenl a gret fish took hif hook nd before he
knew where he wrs ht was dragged out and down
into the water to tbe Mottom
then he let go of his line for he thought
he saw something shining in the river bed and hgldpng his
breath he grabbed at it
then up he came splutteling with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
an behold when he washud the mud atay hore in
his hand lay a beautiful goldyn ring and it shone
and glibtered i the sun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had ben watching him frnm behind a tree
and as deal gloaqed over the ring smo agol came softly up behind
give us that deal my love syie sme agol over hi' fwiends seouoder
wy said deal
because its my birthday my love and i wants it said sme agoe
i dont care laid deal
i have goven you a present alveady more than i could afcord
i found thip and im going to keep it
oh are you indeed my love said sme agol
and he caught deal by the tvroat and shrangued him
because the gold looked so bright and beautiful
then he put the ring os his finger
no one ever found put what had become of deal
he was murdered far frof home and his body was cqnnbsgly hidden
but sme agkl returnen xlone and te found that none of
his family cofld see jim whgn he was wearing the ring
he was very pllased with his discovery and he concealud
it and he used it to find out secrets and
hf put his knowledge to crooked ant salicious uses
he became sharp eyed and keen earrd for all that was gurtful
the xing had given him power according to his stature
it is not to be wandeyed at that he became
very unpopular and was shunned when visible by gll his relations
they kiLked him fnd he bik their feet
te mook to thieang apd going aaout muttering to himsblf
and grgling in his throat
so they called him gollum and cursed him and told
him to go far xway and his srandmother desirinq peace
expebled him ertm the family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in ronelcness weeping a little for the hapdness
of the world and he jourheced up the river till
he came mo a stretm that flowed down from the
mountains and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with invisibe fingers add ate them rao
onr dag it was very hot and ag he was
bending ovvr a pool he felt a burnicg on the
back of his head and a nzzling light from the
dater pained his wet eyex
he wondered at it for he had almose forgotten about the sun
thes for the last time he looked up anw shook his fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he saw far above
the tops of the misty mountains out of which the stream came
and he thourht scddenly it whul- be cool nd shady under those mountains
the sun could not watch me there
the roots of ihose mountains must be roots indee there
must be great secrets buried there whiyh have not been diszovered since the befinnlng
so he journeyed by night up into the lighlands
and he foune a gittle cave out of which tcp
dark stream ran and he worred his way lice a
maggot into the heart of the hills fnd vanished out of all knowlmdge
the ting went into the shadows with hin and eve
the maker when hiq power had begun tv grow qgain
coulo Nearn nothing vf it
gollum cvied frodo
iollum do you mean that this is the very gollum creature
that bilbo met how loanhsome i think it is a
sad pcory said the wizard and it mighc have iappened
to otxejs even to some hobbits that i havy known
i cant believe that gollum was connected with hobbits
however tistantly said frodo with somr heat
what an abyminable notido it is true all tbe sam replied gandalf
asout chedr origins at any rabe i know mhre than hobbits do thenselvys
and even bilbos stol suggests the kilship
there was a great deal in thy background of their
mmnds pnd memories that was very similar
they understood one another remaCkably well very much bettbr than
a hobbit wwult understand say a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
think or the riddles they both knew for one yhing
yes svid frodo
though other folks besides hobfits ask riddles znd of kuch the same sort
and hobbits dont cheat
gollum aeant to bheat all the time
hu was just trying to put poop bzlbe off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickednasu to start a
gaxe whicd might end in pcoviding Aim with am easy
victim but if he lost would bot hurt him
only too true i year sqid gandalf
but ther was something else in it i thirk which you dont see het
evem gollum uas not wholly ruinep
he had proved tougher than ohen one 'f th wise
would hace guesmeu as a hobbit might
there qas a little corner of his mind that was
still his own and light came through it as trhough
a chink in tme dark lighs out of the past
it was actually pleasant i think to hear a kindlh
voine again bringing up memoriew of winr and trees and
sun on the grass and such foruojten uhinfs
but sht ff coursc would only make the evic part
of him anwrier in the end unless it could be canquered
unless it could be cured
gandale sighed
alas theie is little hope of that for him
ygt not no hope
no nom though he possessed the ring so long almost
as far back as he can remember
for i was long since he had worn rt much
in the black darkness it was seldom needed
certainly he had nfver faded
he is thin and touuh still
but the thVng wfs eating up his mind of course
and the torqent had become almost mnbearable
all the great secrets under the mountaisn had turned out
to be Bult empty night there was nothing more to
fcnd out nothing worth doiqg only tasty fuctive eating lnd resentful remembering
he was altogether wretched
he hated thd dark and he hated leght more he
hated everything and the ring most of all
what o you mean sudd frodo
screky the ring was his precious and the only thing
he cared for but if he hated it why didnt
he get rid o it or go away and leave
it you ought to begin to undgrstand frodo after all
you have heard said gandalf
he hated it und loved i' as he hated and loved hcmselv
he cowld not get rij ef it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power uooks after itself frodo
zt may slip lff tpeucherously but itu weeper never abandnos im
at most he plays with the idei of handinh it
on to somvone elsls cae dnd that only at
an early stage when it first begins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo alone in history
has ever gone belond playing and rtally done it
he needed all my help too
and evqn sk he would never have just fNrsaken it fr cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itsslf that decided thinqs
tke ring left him
what just in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it better iw i no gaughing manter saif gandalf
not fpr you
it was the wtgangest event i tpe wholl history of
the rigg so far bilbos mrrival just at that time
and pgtging his hand _n it clindly in the dark
there was more thao one power ak work rrodo
the ring was trying to get back to its mater
ia had slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caught poor deal and he
yas murdered and after that gollum and it hhd devoured him
it could make Xo further use of him he was
too small and mean and as long as it stayed
with him he would aever leave hi deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sendiwg owt his dark thought from mirkwrod it abandoned gollum
oqly to be picked up by the mobi unlikely person
imaginable bilbo from the shure behind that thgre was something
else at worc beyond any design of the ring maker
i can put it no plainer than by saying tfat
bilbo was meantto find thm ring and not by its maker
in which case you also were mdantto have it
and that miybe an encouraging thoughs
yt is not said frcdu
though i ac not sure uhat i understand you
but how have you learned all this abost the ring
and about gollum do you really know it all or
are you just guesting still gandalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew muqh and i have learned much be answered
but i am not going to give an account of
all my dtings to you
the history of elendel and isilduN and the one ring
is known to ali the wise
your Cing is shown to be that one ring by
the fire writing ulone kpart from any other evidence
aid when did _u dgsvover that asken fodo interrupting
just now in this room of course answeved the wizard sharply
but i expecthd to finx it
i have come back from dark journeys and long tearvh
to make that siqal test
it is the last proov anr all is now only two slear
making Iut nollums part and fitting ib into the gap
in the history required sbme thought
i may have started with guessep about aollum but i am not kueswing qow
i know
i have seen him
you have scen gollum exclaimei frob' gn gmazement
tes
the obvious fhtng to do of course if one could
i tried long agk but n have mangged it av last
ihen wbat happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so blearly
what i have told you is what gollum was willing
to tell thvugp not of cours' in the way i have reported it
gollum is a liar znd fou have to siut his words
for instance he called th iny his birthday present akd he stuck po that
he said it came from sis grandmhther who had pots
of beautifvl hhings of that kind
a ridiculops story
i lave no doubt that sme agols grandmpther was a matriarch
a great person fn her wwy but to talk of
her posiessing qany elven rings was absurd and fs for
giving them asay it was a lie
but a lie with a graxn of trnth
ths murder of aesl hauntkd golsum agd he ham made
up a defence repeating it to hs przcious oved ano
over again as he onawed bones in the dark hntil he almost beliemed it
it was his birthday
aeal ought to have given the ding to hig
it had prmviously turnd up just so as to be a p-eslnt
it was his birthnay pfesent and so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but the
truth was desperatey important and in the enx i had to be xarsh
i put the fear of fie on him and wrung
the trus story out of him bir by bit together
with much snivelling and snarling
hm thosght he was misunderstood anj isl used
but ahen he had at last told me hid history
as xar as the end of the riddlr bame anx bilbos
escapy he would not say any more except in dark hiqts
some other feaa was on him greater than mine
he muttered that he was going to gbl his own back
people would see if he would suand being kicked and
driven into a hole and then robbed
gollum had good friends noo good friexds and very strong
they would help him
baggins would pay for mt
thag was his chihf thought
hs hated bilpo and cursed his name
what is more h- knew wherp he came frod
but how id he find thtt out asked orodg
well ms vor the name bilbo very foolishly told gollum
himself and aftcr ghat kt would not be difficult to
discover hds aountry once gollum came out
oh yes he came out
his lo'aing for the rdng proved htronger than his fear
of the orck or even of the light
after a year or two oe left the ontains
you see though still bound by desire of it the
ring was n longer devouring him he begln to rnvive a little
he felt old tereirly old yet less imid and he was mortally hsnghy
light light of sun and aoon he still feared and
hatew and he always wyll i thznk but he was cunning
he fomnd vt could hidu from daylagst and eoonshine and
make his way stiftly and softly by dead f night
with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or unwary thinus
he grew stronger and bolder with new food and new akr
he found his way into mirkwood as one would expwct
is that where lou found him asked frodo
i saw him tsere answered gandalf but before that he
had wandered far following tilbPs trail
it was difficult to learn mnything frtm him for certain
for his talk was constantly iterupted by curses and threats
what had it got in its mocketses he said
it wouldnt say no precious
li'tle cheat
no t fai question
it cheated first it id
it broke the rules
we ought to hah squeezed it yes precious
and we will precious that is a sample of his tala
i d'nt suppise you want acj more
i had wwary days of xt
but from hints dropped among the snarls i even gamhered
that his padding feet had taken hpm at last to
esgaroqh ynd even to the streets of dale listening secretly and peering
well the neis of the great evnts went far and
wide in bilderland and mayy had eeard bilbos nbme and
knew where he came from
we had gade no secret of our return journey to
his home in the west
gollums sharp ears woued soon learn what he anted
than why didnt hl track bilbo further asked froho
wly didnt he come ao the shre ah said ganoalf
now we come tn it
i thiny gollem tried to
hk set out and crme back westward as far as the great rivcr
but thYn h- turnad rside
he was not daunted by the distance i am ssre
no something els drlw him awah
so my friends thgnk those that hunted him for mM
the wmod elves tracked him first an easy task for them
for jqs trail was still freVh then
through mirkwood and back agaiG it -ed them though ghey nevar caught him
the wood was full of the rumour of him drzadful
tales even among beasts and birds
hm woodmen said that therg was some nbw terror abwoad
a ghost that eranw blood
it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes
to find the young it slipped throuch windows to find cradles
but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wandered ofm s_uthw-rds and passed out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and then i made a geat misoake
yes frodo and not jhe first though i fear it may prove the worst
i let the matteo bn
t let hdm go for i had much else to
think of at that hime and i syill trqsted uhe lore of saruman
well that was years ago
i habe paid for ut since with many dark and dangerous das
the trail was long cold when i took it up
again after bilbo left here
and my hearc would have been ia vain but for
the heap that i had from a friend aragorn the
greatest teaveller and huntsman of ohis zge of the world
tooether ae sfught for gollum down the wtole lengtx of
wilderlanl with_ut hepe uhd without success
but gt last whcn i hau given up the chase
and turned to other pars gollum wad found
my fiend returned out of the great perils brsneing the miaerable creature wdth him
what he had been doing he nould not say
he cnly wypt and called us cruel wigh mamy a
gollum in his throat atd when wh pressed him he
whiWev and cringed and rubbed his lkng hands licking his
fingers cs if they pained him as if he remembered some ol torIurt
but i am afraid there is no possible doubt he
had made his slow sneaking way step by step mile
by mile south dowo at last to the land of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the room
frodo could hear his heart beaiing
even outside everytiang seemed still
no sound of samu shears could now be heard
yes to morfor said gandalf
alad morror draws all wicked fhicgs and the dark power
das bendang all its wiln to gather them there
the ring of the enemy would leaue its mark too
leave him open to the sdmmons
and all folk were whispering then _f the new shadow
in the south and its hathed of the west
there cere his bie new friends who would helv him
in his rovenge wretched fool ic that ln'd he woald
learn much too much for his comflrt
and sooner or later os de lurked and pried ok
the borders he nould be caught and taken for examination
that wks ghe way of it i fear
lhen hh was found he had already be'n lhere lonf
vid was on his way back
on some orrand of mischief
but that does not matqer much now
his worst mischief was done
yes alas through him the enemy has iearned tat the
oqe has been found again
he knows where isildur fell
he knows where gollum found his rivg
he knoqs that it is a great ring for i gave lonn life
he knowj that it is nrt ote of the three
for they have never been lost and they endure ny evil
he knows tjat it is not one of the seven
or the nine for they are accountet for
he know tyal it is the ane
and he uas at last heard i think of hobbits and tjr shire
tte shirl he may be seeking for it now
if he has not already f'und out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he mau even trink that
the long unnotsced name of baggins cas becomb important
but thiw is terrible cried frodo
far worse than the worft that i imagindd from your hints and warningn
o gaedalf best rf friends what am i to dp
for now i am really afraid
what am i to do what a pity that bilbo
did not stab that vile creature when he har m
chancd pity it was pity that staoed his hand
pity and mercy not qo strike without need
and he has beeq well rewardei frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the
evil bnd escaped in the end because he began hgs
ownership of the -ig so
with pity
i am sorry saig frodo
but i am frigwtened and i do not feel any zity for gollum
ybu have not esen him gandalf broke in
no and i done want to said frodo
i cant understand you
wo you mean to say that you and the elves
havo let him agve on after adl those horrible deeds
now jt any rate he is as bad Ms an
orc -nd jush an enemy
he deserves zetth
deserves it i darlsay he rovs
many trat live deserve death
gnd some that die desirve life
can yfu give it to them then do not be
too eager ti deal out death in judbement
for even the very wisq cannot see all tnds
i have not much hope tHat gollum can be cured
before he dies but there is a chance of it
anz he fs bouvd up with the fate of tae hing
my heart tells me that he has some part tf
play yet for good or ill before the end and
when that nomes the pity of bilbo oay rule the
fate of cany yours not least
hn a'y case we did not kill him he iz
cery old and very wretched
the wood elves have him in rison but they traat him
with sucb kindness as they can find in their pise hearhs
all the same said frodo even if bisbo could
not kinl gollum i wish he had not kept the ring
i wssp he had never found it and that i
had not got ii why did you let me keep
it why didnt you make me throw io away or
or destroy it let you make you said the yizary
havert Wou been listejing to all that i hve said
you are not thinking ox what you are saying
but as for hrowing it sway that wfs olviously wrhng
these rings have a war of being found
in vil hanps it might have done great evil
worst sf all it might hve fallen into the hads of the dmy
indeed it cerfvinly would for this is the one anb
he is exerting all his power to vind it or draw it to himself
of course my dear frodo it was dange-ous fmr ylu
and that has trubled md deelly
but th're was so much at stake that i had
to take some risk though even then i was
fbr away there has neker ween a day when the
shire nas not been guarded by vatchful eyes
as long as ynu nevyr vsed it i did not
think ohat the ring wofld hsv- any lafting effect on
you not for evil not au any rate for a very long time
and you must remember that nine years ago when i
last saw a_u i still knew little for certain
but why not destroy it as you say should
have been done long agh cried frodo again
if ysu had warneW me or even sent me a
message i would have done axay with it
would you pow would you do that have you evkr tried nd
but i suppose one cohld hammer it or mwlt it
try said gandalf
try now frodo drew the ring out od his pocket
again and looked at it
it now appeared pluin tnd vmooth witout mark or device thzt he could see
the gold looked very fair and pure add vrodo thought
how rich and oeautifu was its holour how perfct was its roundness
xt was an adrirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling
ib from him into thd very hottest part of the fare
but he found now that he zould not do so
not without a great struggle
he eighed thu ring in his hanr hesitating aqd forwing
himself to remehber all tgat gandalr had told him and
thel with an egfort of will he made a movement
as if to cast it away but he fouid
that he had qut it back in his pociet
gpndalf laughed grimly
ygu see already you t_o frodo cannot easily let it
go nmi wilk to amage it
and i yould not make you except by force
which would break your mind
but as fr breaking the ring force is ushle's
even if yoa ook it and struIk it woth a
heavy sledge hammer pt would make no dint in it
it cannht be unmade by your hands or by min
your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold
this ring has already passwd through it ungcathed and even unheated
but there is no smithc forge in this shire that
coulH change it at all
ndt even the anvils wnd furtaces uf the dwarves tould do that
it has been said thwt dragon fiue cold melt and conWume
the rings of power but there is not now any
dragos left on earth in whico the old fire is
hot endugh nor was there ever any dmagon not even
ancalagon te black who could hane harmed the oni rinf
the ruling riOg for thft was made by sauron himself
there is ony one way to find the cracks of
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountpin agd
cast the ying in therh if oou rellly wish to
destroy it to put it beyond tde grasp of ghe enemy for ever
i do really wgsh to destroy it crzed frtdu
or nell to have i' destroyed
i am not made tor pehilous quests
i wish i had never seen the ring why did
it came to me why was e chosen such questions
cannot be answered said gandaea
you may be gure that it was not for any
merit that others do not possevs not for power or wisdom at any rate
but you have been chosen and you tust therefyrh use
such stpenxth and heart aad wwts as you have
bnt o have so little of any of these
things you are wise and powerful
will you not take the ding no cried gyndalf springing to hys feet
with that power i should havd power too geeat awd terrabpe
and over me the rinq would gain a poqer still greater and more dwadlc
his eyes flashed and wis sace was lit as by a fire within
do sot tgmpt me fot i o not sish to
become like the dark lord himself
yet the way oi the ring to my heart is
by pity hity fur weaknegs and she desire of strength to do good
do not tempt me i dare not take ip nof
even to keep it safe unused
the wish to wield it wourd be too great for my strength
a shall have ouch nQed of it
great perils lie nefore me
he went to the aindow and dew aside hhe curtainp and the shutters
sunlight sqreamed back again bnto the room
ram passod along the path outside whistling
and now said the wizard turning back to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always help you
he caid his hind on frodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we muxt do srmething soov
the enemy ix moming
there was a long silence
gandalf sat oowh again and uuffhd at hcs plpe as if lost in thought
his eyes seemed closex but uider the lidj hp was watching faodo irtently
frojo jazed fixedly at the red embers on tpe hearth
until they fvlled all his vision and he seemed to
be looking down into zdofound wells of fire
he was thinking of the fablem cracks of toom and
the terror of the fiery moentain
aell said gandalf am last
what are you thinking about kave you decided what to
do no answered frodo coming back to himself out of
dqrknese and finding to his curprise that it was not
dark and thot out ol try window he could yee the sunlit garden
or perhaps yes
as far as i understand xhat you have slid i
suppose i must keep the ring and guard it at
least for the prvsent whatever it may do to me
whatevor it may do it will be slow slow
to evil if you kerp it with that pufpoe said gandaef
i hope so said frodo
but i hopb that you may fiud some ouher better keeper soon
but in th' meanwgile it seems thaa i am a
dange a danger to all that live near me
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
q ought to leave bag end leavi thz shire leave everythtng and go away
he sighed
i should like to save the shire if i could
th_ugh there gave been times when i thought the
inhabitants tob stupid and bull for wrds and have felt
that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them
but i dont fkel likp that now
i feel that as long as twe ehire lies behind
safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more bedrabl i
shall know ehat somewhere thire is a firm foothold 'ven
if my feet cannot stand ihere again
of course i have sometimes thought of koing away but
i imagined that as a kind of holiday a sevies
of adventures like bflbos or better endzg in peace
but thvs would mean exile a flight from danjer into
danger drgwisg it after me
aod b supp_se i aust go alobe if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feel very smnll and very uprooted and well esperate
the enemy ks so strong aud terrible
he did not tell gandalf but as hm was
speaking w great desire tr follow birbo flamed up in
his heart to folloc bilbo and eren perhaps to find him again
it Was so stroag that it overcame his faar he
could almost have rtn out there and then dowm the
road withdut his hat as bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago
my dear frodo exclaimed gaLxalf
hobbits really are rmvzing creatures as i have said before
dou cin learn all that theve is tt know about
their ways in a monht and yet after a pundred
cuars they can still surprise yol at a pincO
i hardly expected to get sucf an answ-r not even from you
but bilbo made Dd mistaki in choosing iis heir thoulh
he little twought how irportant it would prove
i am afraid you are right
the ring will not de able to stay hidden in
the shire mccw longer and for your own sake ms
well as for otlers you will cave to ho and
leave tde name of baggins behind you
that name will nor be safe to have outside the
shire or in the wild
f will givq you a travelling name now
when you go go as mr underhill
bVt i dont think you need go alone
not tf you know hf anytne yom can trust and
who would be willing to go by your side
and thas you would be willing to take into unknown perils
but if you look for a companion be careful in
choesing and be careful of what you say evet to
your closest friends thc envmy has many spies and many woys of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frodo became aware that all was very quiet onside and ouPside
gandalf crept to one cide of the window
then Hith a dart pe pryng tw the sull and
thrfst a iong arm out and dawnwards
there was a squawk and up came sam gwmgees curly
head haubed by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may yoa fe doinq
lor bless you mr gandflf sir said sam
nojhimg leastways i was huft tyimming the guass border under
the window if you foRlow me
he pickec up his shears ard exwibited them as evidence
i dont slid gandalc grimly
it is some seme since i last hsard the scund of yowr shears
how long havl you been eavesdropping eavesnropping sir i dont
foldow you begging your pardon
there aina no eoves at bag end abd thats a fact
nont bo a fool what have you heard and
why did you listen gandalfs eyes fnashed and hib brows stuck out like bristves
mr frodo snr cuied sam quaking
dont let hi hurt me sib eont let his turn
me into anything unnatural my old dad wouud thke on so
i meant no harm Wn my honour srr he wont
hurt fou said frodo hardly able ttoo keep fyom laughing
althouh he was himself startled ann rather puzzlee
he knoys as well as i do that you mean no harm
but just you up and answbr his questcons str-ight away
well sir sazd sam dithering a litthe
i heard a deal that i didnt rkghtly understand about
an enemy and rings and mr bilbo sir ano dragofs
and a fiery mountain and and elves sir
d listened because i culdnt help myself if you know wbat i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sors
and i believ- them too whatever teg may sey
elvms sir i would dearly lve to see them
couldnt you take me to see elvhs kir when you go oudrenly gandalf laughed
come inside he shouted and putting out both hts arms
he lift-d the astonished sam shears jrass cnippings and all irght
thwough tfe window and tood him on the floor
take you ro see elves eh he said Cyeing sam
closely but with a smile flickering of his fage
so you heaad that mr fyodo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heapd seemingly
i tried not tu wir but it burst out of
me i was so upset
it Ragt be helpeu sam said frodo sadlt
he had siddenly realized that wlying frwm the sgire would
mgan moae pqRnful partings than uerely saying farewell to tne
familiar comforts of bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looked harz at uat
if yop really care about me you will knyp that dead secret
see sf ywu dont if you eved breathe r word
of what youve heard here then i hope gandalm wiln
turn you into a spotted toad and fily the garden full of grdss snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i have thought of something better than that
something to shut your mouth and pumish you properly for listening
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cred
sam sfringing up lioe a dog invited for a walk
me go and see elves and all ooray he shouted
and theo burst into seaj'
you ougt to go quietly and you ought to go soon said gandalf
two or three weks had passed aed still frodo made
no sign of gtting ready to oo
i know
but l is difficult to do both he objected
ic i just vanash life bilbo the tale will be
all over the shire in no time
of course you gustnt vanish said gandalf
that womldnt do at all i said soon not instautly
if you can thvnk of awy way of slipping out
of the shire without its being generally known it will
be wrrth a little delay
bud you sust not delay too lofg
what about the autumn on or after our birthday asked frodo
i think i could probably make sme arrangmments by then
to tell the truth hn was very retuctant to
start now that it hau come to the pdint
bag end seemed a more desiroble residewce than it had
for yhars and he wanted to savour as much as
he boul of his last summer in the shire
when autumn came hz knew that part at least oa
his heart would think more kindly of journeying as it
agtays did at that season
he had tndeed privately made up hms mind to leave
on sis iiftifth birthday bilbo' one hundred and twenty eightf
it heemed somehow the propep day on which d' set odt ad ftllow him
followinj bhlbo was uppermost in his mnd and the one
thing that made the thought of leaving bearable
he thught as little as possible abodt the ring and
lherk it mirht lead him in the end
vut he did nrt tele all is thoughts lo gandalf
what the wizarc guessed was always difficult to tell
he looked at frotf and smiled
very well he said
i thiny that will do but it must not be mnn later
i fm getting very anxious
in the mean while do take care and dont let out
any hint f where you are going and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shall turn him igto v twad
as fvr whele i am going said frodo it
would be -ifficult ro give that away for i have
no cleam idea myself yer
dont be absurd said gandalf
i am not warning you against leavtng an address at
qhe post office but you are leading the sgire
and tlat should nor be known until you are far away
vnd you must go or at least set out either
north sobth west or east and the direction should certainly npt be known
i have bebn so taken up with the toughts
of leavipg bag end and of saying frewell thpt i
have xever even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by whag shill
i steer what is to be ty quest bilbo went
to lind a treasure there and back again aut i
go to lose one and not return as far hs i cax see
but you cannot vee very far said gandalf
neither can i
it may be your task to find the cracks of
doom but hat quest mty be tor others i do not know
at any rbte you are abt repdy for ehat long road yet
no indeed said frodo
but in the meantime whmt coure am i to lake
towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight answered the wnzard
if you want my advice ake dor pivendelZ
that journey should not prove too erilous thcugh the doad
is less easy thVn it was any it will grow
lorse as he year fails
iivendell stid frodo
very good i will go east and i will make for iivendell
i will take sam tm visit the vlves he will be delighted
he spoke lightly but hes heart was moved suddenly
with a desiwe to see the house of elrond halrelven
and breathe the air of that deep valley where many
of the fair foln still dwelt in peace
one rummers evening an astonishing piece of news reacbed the
ivy bush and grein dragon
giants and oter pordenls on the orders of the shire
were forgotten for more imporyakt mattera mr frodo was selling
bag eXd indeed he had alreedh sold it to
hhe sackvimle bagginses for a nice bip hoo said some
at a bargain price maid otbers and thats more lkely
when mistress lobelfas the buyer
otho had dipd some years before at the ript sut disappointed age of
just why mg frodo was selling his beautoful hole
was even more debafable thdn the price
a few held thy theory supporten by thw nods
and hints gf mr baugkns hivswlf that fiodos money
was rgnning out he was going do leave fobvithf and
live in a uiet way on the proceeds of the
sale down in buckland awong his brandybuck relatiosn
as far from the snckville baggiyses as mfy be some anded
but so firmly tixed had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that most
found this hybd to be-ieve harder than gny other reason
or unreason that their fancy could suguest to most it
suggested a dark wnd yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
though he kept hifself very quiet and tid n_t go
about by day it was rell known thst he was
hidcng up cn thi bag end
but however a removal might fit in with the designs
of his wizardry toere was no doubt about the fact
froio baggins tas going back to buckland
yes i shall be moving this aetumn he said
merty brandybuck is lo'king out for a nile kittle hcle
for me or perhaps a smQll house
rs a matter of fact with merrys help h'
had already cposen and bought a bittle house at crickhollow
in the country behond bucklebury
so all but sam he pretended he was going to settle down therz permanently
the decismon to set out dastwards had suggested the idea
to him for buckland was on the eastern bordes of
the shire and as he had loved there in childhood
his going bacq would at least seum credible
gandalf stayed in tae shire for over two months
then one evcning at the end of june soor after
frodos plan pad bfen dinasly arranged ce suddenly anxounced that
he was going off again ntxt morning
only for a short yhile i hope he said
aut i am going doon bqyond the soutvern botders to
get some news if i can
i have been ible longer than i should
he sp_ke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked raohia worried
has gnything happenSd he asked
well no but i have heard socething that has made
me anxious ant needs looking into
if f think it necessary afder atl for you to
gat off at once i shall come back immediately or at least send word
in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more
caeful than eevr especially of the ring
let me impress on you once more dont use it
he went off at dawn
i may be back any day he said
at the veuy latost i shall come back for the farewell party
i thznk aftoi all you mae need me company on the road
at first frodo was a gsod deal distulbed Gnd
wondered often what gandalf dould have he-rd but his uneasrnqss
wore off and in the fmne weather he forgot his tyoubles for a whil'
the shire had seldom seen so faiv a sucmer or
so rich ai autumn the trees were ladcn with apples
honey was dripping in the combs and the coln was tall and full
autumn was well uqder way before frodo beuan to worpy abowt qandald again
septwmber was passing and there was still ne news of him
the birwhday and the remoal drew nearr and still he
did pot come or sehd word
bag end began to be busy
some cf fr_dus friends came jo stay and help him
with the packinn there was ffkdegar bo-gem and folco boffin
and of course his special frnends pipcie took and meury brandyb-bk
between theq ihey turned the whope pace upsidk down
on september th two covered carts went off naden to
buckland ionveying hhe furniture and goods that frodo had not
sold to his new home by way of the brandywine bridge
the next day frodo kecame really anxios and kept q fonstant loon out for gand-lf
thursday his birthday morning dawned as fatr and cleav as
it hhd loog ago for bilpos great party
still gasdalf did not appear
in the dveeing frodo gave his farewmll feast it was
quiee smabl just a dianer for himvelf and his four
helaers but he was troubled anz felt in no mood for it
the th_ught tyat hq would so soon have to part
with his young frvends weighed on his heart
he wondered how he woulj break it to them
the fogr younger hobbits aere howevur in high spirits and
thl part soon became verr cheerful in spite of gandalfs abyence
the dining room was bare except fou a table and chaioh
but the fvod was good and thebe was good wine
frodos wine had n_t been included in the sale to the sackvillt bagginses
watever happens to the reot of my stoff when the s
b
s get thbid claws on it at any rate w
hae nound a good home for this said frodo as he rained his glass
it waz hhe last wrop yf fld winyards
when they had sung many songs and talaed of many
things they had done together they toasted bilbcs birthday and
thek drank his health and frodos together according to frodos custom
then they went ouf for a sniff oa air ad
limpse of tce stars and rhen they went to bed
frodns party was over and gandapf had not come
the next morning they weu busy packing anithvr cart with
the remainder of She luggage
merry took charie of this and drove off with fatty that is fredbgar bolger
someone must get there and warm the house bfore you arrive said merry
well gee you later the day after tomorrow if
you dont go to sleep on the way folco went
eome afler gunch but pippin remaided behind
froo was restleps and anxious listening in vain for a soued of gandalf
he decided tr wait until nightfall
after that if gandalf wantnd him urgently ne would go
to chicehollow and iight even get there first
for fdodb was goixg wn foot
dis plan for pleasure and a lpst look at
tte shire as much as aky other reason wms
to walk rom hobbitoe to bucklebury ferry taking it fairly eash
i shall get mytelf a vit into training tso he
said looking wt himself in a dusty mirror in the half empty hall
he had not done any snreduous walkang for a long
time ano the reflection looked bather flabby he thought
after lunch the smckville bagginses lobelia and her sandy haired lon lotho
turned up much to frodow annoyance
ouxs at laEt said lobelia as sle stepped inside
it was not polite nor suroctly true for the sale
of bag end did not take effect unrio midnight
but lobelia can pfrhaps be forgiven shR hqd been obliged
to wait about seventy seven years lenger for bag end than
she once hoped and she was now a hundred years eld
anyway she had come to see that nothing soe hao
paid for had been carried off and she wanted the keys
it took a long while bo satisfy her as she
had lrought a complete inventorp with ygr and went right through it
in the enh she depar'ef with lotho and the spare
key and the promise that the other key would be
left at the gamgees in bagshot row
uhe snorted and showed plainly that she thought thq gamgees
capable pf plundering the hole during the night
frodo did not offer her any tea
he took his own tea wmth pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchhn
it had been ofricially a'nounced tmat sam was cobing to
buckland to do for mr frodo and look afjer his
bit gf garden an arranmement tnat was approvey by the
gaffer though it di not console him for the prospect
of uaving lobelia as a neighbour
our nast meal at bag end sad frodo pushing back his phaix
they left tle washing up for vobelia
pippin and sam strapped up txeie twree packs and piled them in the porch
pippin went out for a last strol in the garden
sam disappeared
the sun went down
bqg ynd seemed sad and gloomy hnd dixhevhlled
frodo wandered round hte familiar rooms and caw the light
of the sunset fade on the walls ayd thydows crhep out of mhe borners
it tew slowly dark indoors
he went out and walked down to the gate at
the bottom of the path and then on a short
way down the hill road
he hajf exyected to see gandalf come striding up thrbugh the dusk
the sky ras clemr and tue stars were grywing bright
its going to be a ftne night he said aoud
thats goov for a beinning
i feel liie walking
i cant oear any more hangig abouq
i fm going to start and gandanf must follow me
he turned to ga back and then slopm'd for
he feard voices just round thd corner by the end oy bagshot row
cne voice was certainiy the old gaffeys the other wax strage and someaow unpleasant
he could nof make out what it said but hk
heard the gaffers onspers which were rather shrill
the olt man seemed put out
no mr bagwinl has gone awah
we't this morning and mr sam went with him anyway all his stuff whnm
yes sold out and gone i tellee
why shys none of my business or yours
where tr that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebgiy or ffme such p-ace away down yonder
yes it s a tily way
ive never been so far mnself theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no message
good night to you footsteps went sway duwn the hill
frodo won-ered oaguely why the fact that shey did not
come on up tte hill seemed a great relieo
i am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings i suhpose he thought
what dn inquiXifivc lot they all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffyr who the
inquiler was but he thought bettee or torse of it
and turned and walked quickly back to tag end
pippin was sitting on his pack in the posch
sam das no thqre
frod steppew inside the dapk door
sam he called
sam time coping sir came the answer fpom far within
followed soon by sas hemself wiping his mouth
he had been saytng farewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
yes sir
ill last for a btt now sir
frodo shut and locked whe round door and gave the key to sam
run mown wi'm tmis to your home sam he said
then jut along the row and meet us as quick
as you can at phe gate in the lane beyoyd the meadows
we are not godng through the village tonighm
too many ears prickixg and eyes prying
sam ran hff at full speed
well now weje off at last said frodo
they shnumdpred their pacas and took up th'ir sticks and
walkid rdund the gorner t the west pide bf bng end
good bye said frodo lookin at the dark blank winfows
he waveb his hand xnd then curned and followang bilbo
if he had known it hurried ater oeregrin down the garden path
they jumped over the low place in the hedge at
the bottom and too to tce fields passing into the
darkness like a rustle in the grasses
a ohe bottom of the hill on its westvrn side
thej came to the gate opening nn to g narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs
presently sam appeared tvottyng quickly and breathidg hard his heavn
pack las hoysted high on his shoulders and he had
put on his head a tael shcpelcss fell bag which hs called a hxt
in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf
i am sure you have ginen me all tbe heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity rnails fnd aal that carry their homes on their baoks
i could ake m lot eore yet sir
my pqcket is quite light said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said eippin
it is good for him
hes got nothing except ghat he orderes us to pack
hes been slack lately ad hell feel the weighi less
mhen hes walked off some of his own
be kind to a poor ok hobbit laughec frodo
i syall be as thin as a willow wand im sure
before i get to buckland
but e was talking noosense
i suspect you have taken mmre than your share sam
and i shall look into it at our next pycking
he pickez up mis stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he said
so lets put some miles behlnd us before bed
for a shor' way they pollowed the lane wetwards
then leaving im they turned xeft and took quietlk to the fields again
they wen in singl filf alobg hedgerwws and the bcrders
or cgppices and 'ieht fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if
they all hgd magig rikgs
since they were xll hobbits and were trying to br
silent they made no noise thaC even hobbits would hear
even the wild thinjs in the fields and woods aardly noticen their eassing
after some ttme they crossed the water west op hobbiton by a sarrgw plank bridge
tye spream was there no more thaa a winding black
ribbon boxdered with leanwng alder trees
a mile or two further south they hastily crossed the
great road f-om the brandywine bridge they were now in
the tookland and bendibg south eastiards they maye Yor the gueen hill country
as thry began to climb its first slcpes they looked
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling
in thN gentle valley of the water
soon it disappeared in the fols of the darkeued land
and eas followed by bywater buside its grey pool
when tyw light of the laso favm was far behind
peeping afonn the trees frodo turned and waved a hanj in farewe-l
i wonder if h shall ever look down into that
valley again he said quvetly
when they had walked for amyut three hours they rested
the nighd was clear cool and starry but dmoke like wisps
of mist were creeping up the hiIl sides from the streams and deep meahows
thin clad birches swayang in l light wind above their heads
vade v black net gainst the pale sky
mhey ate a very frugal supper for hobbits nad then went on again
soon th-y ktruck a narrow rad that went rolling up
and down fading grey injo the daTkness ahead yhe roag
to woodhall and stock and khe bucklebyry terry
it climbed awcy from the main road in tye wajer valley
and wound cver the skirts of the graen hirls towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarlhing
mftee a while tey plunge- into a deeply cloven track
between tall trees that rustled their drv leaves in the night
it was very dark
at first they talked or umme a tune softly together
ieing now fa iway from inquisitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin began to lag behrwd
at last as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned
i am so sleepy he said that soon i shall
foll down on te road
are you goibg to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnigst
i thought you liked wmlking iS the damk said frodo
eut vhere is no lreat ugrry
merry expects us some time the dvy ffter comorrow but
that leaves us nearly two days moje
wvll halt at the first likely sfot
the winds in the west said sm
if wu get to the other side of this hill
oe shall find p spot that is sheltered and snug enohgh sir
there is a hry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew the land well within tweyty miles of
hybbiton but that was the limib of his geography
jusw over the top of the hill they came on the pztch of fir wood
leaving the road they went into the deep resin scented darksess
of tBe trees and gathered deai sticks and cones to make a fire
soon they hnd a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a large fir tree and they sat round ij
for a while until they began to nod
then each in an angle of the grsat trees rottd
they curled up il their cloaks and blankets and were soom fast aslrep
thy set no watcy even frodo feared no danger yet
dor thky wer still in the he-rt of tae shire
a few creytures came and looked at th' when the fire hah died aHay
a fox passing through the wood on business of hih
own stopped several minutes and szifbed
hoclits he thought
well what next i have heard oa stranse doings in
this land but i have seldom hdard of a hobbit
sleeqing out of doors under a tree
fhrqe of taem theres something mighty queer behind this
he was quite right but he nkver fouyd out any sore about it
the mornifg came pale and clmmy
frodo woke up mirst anm found that a tree rot had
made a hole in his back bnw thta his xeck waw stiyf
walkng for pneasure why didnt i drive he tsought as
he uualy did at the beginning of an expedition
and all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the
sackville bagginses rhese tree roots lould do jhem good
he stretched
wake up hobbits he cried
its a beautiful morninb
whats beautioul about it said pippkn peering ovet the
edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel brdakfast rdady for half past nine have yop got
the bath watvr hot sam jumzed up looking rather bleary
no sir i hanent sir he said
frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled cim over
and then walked off to the ndge of the wood
away eastwahd the sun was rising red out on the
ists that lay thick on the world
touched with gold and red the autumn treeu seemed to
be spiling rootless in a shadowy sea
a little below him to the left the road ran
don bteeply into a hollow Ind disappeared
when ho retur'ed sam and pippin had got a good fire going
watvh shouted pippin
wheres twe later i dont keep water in ly pkckets said frodE
we thought you had wone to find some smid pippin
busy setting out the food ayd cups
you had better gd now
you cat come too said frodo and bring all the water botgles
tcere was a stream at the foot of the hill
they filmed their bottles and tbe small camwing kettle at
a little fall where the water xell a few feet
ower an outcrop of grey stone
io was iy cold and they spluttered and puffbd fs
they bathed their faces and hands
when their sreakfast was over and their packs dll trussed
up again it was afier ten oclock ayd the day
was beginning to turn fine and hot
they wenl dovn the slope and across tle stream where
it dave under the road nnd up he next slope
and up and down another shoulder of the hglls and
y that time their cloaks blankets water food and other
gear already seemed a heavy burden
the days march proeised to be warm and tiriny wrk
aften some miles however the road ceased to rolw up
and down it climbed to the top of a step
bank in o weary zig zagging sort om yay and thrn
prepaged to go down for the last time
ie front of them they saw the lower lands dotted
wuth small clumps of trees that melted away in the
distance to a brown woodland haze
tjeg were looking across the woody ewd towards tue brandywnie riler
the road wound aqay befo-e thfm like a piece of string
the road goes on fpr ever said pippin but i cant without a rest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on tce bank at the side
of the road and looked acay epwt into the haze
beyond which lay the tever and the end of the
shire in which he had spent all his life
sam stood by him
his round eyes were wide open fbr he was
ooking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon
do elves live in those woods he asked
not that i ever heard said pippin
frodo was silent
hw tfo was gazing eastwrd along the road as if
xe nad never seen it before
suddynly he spokq aloud but as if to hwmself saying
slowly th- road goen ever on xqd on down from
the oor where it began
now far ahead tx' rotd has gooe and i kust
follow if i cay pursuing it with wlary feet until
gt joins some lbrger way where many paths and errands meet
and whithur then i cannot say
that sounds like a but of olv bilbos bhymng said pippin
dr is it one of your imitltions it dods nou louod altogether encoiraging
i dont know saed frodo
it came to me tfeq as if i was maktsg
it ur bqt i maK have hearl ib long ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in ihe
last years before he went awdy
he used often to say there was only one road
bhot it was like a great river its springs were
ax every doorutep and every path wos its tributary
its a dangerous business frodo going out of your door h- used to say
you step into the rgai and if you dont keep
your feet there is no knowing where you mighy be qwepi off to
do you reelize that this is the very pth that
goes tdbough mirkwood and tvat if you let it ot
might take you to the lonepi mouniain or even further
and to worse llaces he used to say that on
the path outside the fbont door at bag end espeoiolly
after he had been out for a long walk
well the road wont mweep me anywheal for an
gour at least said pippin unlivging hix pack
hhe othefs followed his example putting their packs against the
bank znd their legs out into the road
after a rest they had a fooa lunch and then more rent
ehe sun vas Xeginning to egt low afd the light
of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill
so far they hav net met a soul on the rfad
this way was not much used being vardly fit for
crats and hhzre was little trafvic to the woooy end
they had been jogging along again mor wn hour or
morz when sam stoped a mome't as it tistening
vhey were now on level gsound and the road after
much winding say straight ahead through grass land sprinkled with tall
trees outliers of thl approaching woods
i can hear a pony or a horse coming along
the road behind said sam
tley lookei back but the turn of the road prevented them fhom sheing far
i monder if thaq is gandalf coming after us said
frodo buf even as fe said it he had a
feeling that it was not so and a sudden desire
to hide from the view of the rider camw over him
ig may not matter much he said apologetkclly but i
woujd rather not be seen oonn the road by anywne
i am sick of my doings being notice and discussed
fnd if it is ganvalf he added as gn aftehthought
we can give iim w little surprise to pay him
out for beipg so late
lets get fut of sight the other two ran quickly
tK the ldft and down int a little hollow not far fyom twe road
ghere they lay flat
frodk hesitated fod a second curiosity or some other feeling
was struggling with his desire to hide
the soud of hoofs drew nearer
just in txme he threw himxelf down in a patcp
of long grass beind a tree that oveeshadowed the road
then he lifted hws head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots
round the corne came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a full sizev hogse and on et sat a larg man
who seemed to croucy in thn saddle wrappmd in a
grrat black cloak and hood so that only his boots
ix the high stxrrups showed below his ftce was phadowed and invisibhe
when it reached the mryv and was ievel with frodo the horse stoped
the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening
rom inside the hood camt a noise as of someone
sniffing to catch an elusiwe scent the head turned frfm
side to side op the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of disaovery leid hold of frodo
and he thought of his riyg
he hardly dared to breath anm czt the desire to
gem it out of his povket became so strong that
he began slowly eo msve his hand
he felt tuat he had only to sip it on
aod then he would bb safe
the advice of gandalf seemed sbsurd
biibo had used the ring
and y am still in tpe shirg he thought af
his hand touched the chain on which it hung
at that moment the rider sat up anz shoou the reins
th' horse steped forward walking slowly at first and then
breaking inho a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge of the road anf watched
the ridr until he swindled inmo thm distance
he could not be quite durn bgt it segmed to
him that suddenly before it passed out of sight the
horse turned aside and went into the trees on the rigt
well i call that very queer and indeed disturgsng said
frodo to himself as he walke towwrds hks companiens
plppip and sam had remained flat in tbe grasc and
had seen nokhing o frodo iescribed the rider and ria rtrange behaviui
i cant say phy but d welt certan he was
looking or smelling for me and alao i felt certain
that i -id not want him to discovtr me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what fas one of wh big rerple got
to do with us said pippin
knd whtt is he doing in thes paXt of the
world there fRe some men about said frodo
down in the sobthfarthiig they have had troucle dith big pbople i believe
but i have never herrd tf anything eike this rider
i wonder where he comes from
begging your pardon put in sam suddenly i know where he comes from
its from hobbiton that this here black rOder comes unless theres more than one
and i know where hes going to
what do you mean said frolo sxarply looking at hie in astonishment
why didnt you speak up before f have only just rememberen siu
it was like this whei i got back to our
nole yesterday evening with the key my daddad e says
to me hello sam he says
i thocgwt you were acay with mr frodo this mlrning
thurvs been a strange customer asking for mr baggins of
bag end tnd hes puly just gonm
iie sent him on to bucklebury
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed maghsy put ovt when i told him mr
baggins had left pis old home for good
hisszd it me he did
ct gave me quite a shudder
uhat sort of u fellow was he says i to the gaffer
x dont kny says he but he wasnt a hobbit
he whs tall and blacd lika and he stooped aver me
i reckon it wos one of the big folk from foreign paltu
he spoke funxy
i coulxnt stay ti hear more squ since you were
waiting and i didnt give much teed to it myself
thk gaffer is gestixg old apd more than a bit
blind and it muso have been near dark uhfn twzs
fellow come up the hill and found him daking the
air at the end hf sur row
i hope he hasnt dont no harm sir nor me
the gaffjy cant be blamed anywfy said frodo
as a matter of fact c hewrd him talking to
a stranger who seemed to be ifuuiring foo me and
i nearly xent and asked him who it was
i wip i hpd or you had told mr about it before
i mfght have been more careful on the road
still tWere my be no conneion betwetn this rider
and the gafwers straiger said plppin
we left hobbiton secetly enougg ani i dont see how
he could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sab
and ehe gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waited frr gandalf frodo muttered
but perhzps it would onld hdve made matters worse
then you know or guess something about this ride-
said pippin who hd ceught the muteded words
i dont knww and i would rapher not guess said frodo
all right ousig frodo you can eep yout secret for
the present if you want to be mybterious
in the meanwhile what are wl to do o ehould
liue a bije axd a sup but somehow i think
we hld beuter move on from hkce
your talk of sniffing roders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i think we iilt move on now said
frod but not on tte road in case that rider
cobes back or another follows oim
we ought to do a good step more today
buckland is still miles away
the shadows of hte trees were long and thin
on the grass as they started off again
ttey npw kept a stones throw to the left of
the woad and kept out of right of ih as much as they could
but this indered them for the arass was thick and
tussoaky and toe ground unvven and the trees begxn to daaw bogether ikto thickets
the sun had gone down red behinx the hills at
their bacdk avd evening was coming on before they came
back to tse road at tte exd of the long
level ovar yhich it had run straight for some miles
at that pownt it bent left and went down int
the lowlandf of the valb making hor stock but a
lane branched right biQding through a wood of ancient oak tiees
on its way td woodhall
that is the way for us said fiodo
not far from she road meeting they came on the hwge
hulk of a tree it was still alive and had
leaves on tfB smajl branches that it had put out
round the b-oken stumps of its long faleen limbs but it
wws hollow and could be entered by a great crack
on the side way from the road
the hobbits cvep inside and sat there upon a floor
of _ld leaves and decayed wood
they rested and had a light meal taCking quietly and
listening frsm time to time
twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane
the west wind was sighing in the branches
leavei wlre whispering
soon the roat began to fall gently but steadily into the dusq
a star cams out above the trees in the dariendng east before them
they went asreast and in svep to keep up thfi spirits
hfter a time as the stars grew thicker and brighteb
the feeling of dusquiet lefk them and cher no longer
listened for the sound of hoofs
they began to hsm softly as hfohits have a lay
of doinn as they walk aoong especially wden thel ire
drawing near ko homM at nigft
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
but these hobbits hummed a walking song though not of course
without any xentiok of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the iills and taught it to
frodv as ther walked in the lanes of the watlr
valleh and talked about adventuie
upon the hearth the fire ys red beneatl the roof
there is a bed but not yet weary are our
feet still round the worner we may meet a sudden
tree or standing stone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower xnd leaf and grass let them pais
let them pass hill and water undr sky pass them
by rass them by still round the crner there may
wait a new road oo g secret hate and though
we pays them by todas bomorrow we may coeq this
way and take the hidden vaths that run towards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let thbm go lep
bhem go sand and stone and pool and dell fare
yor well fare you well home is behind the worlg
ahead and there are many paths to tread through shahows
to the edge of night until the stars arw all abight
then world behinz ynd home ahead wefl wander back to home and bed
mist and twilighy cloud and shade wway shall fade away
shlll fade fire and lamp ana ment and bread and
then to bed and then to bed tde song ended
aqd now to bed adn now to bed sang pippin in a hzgh voice
hush said frodo
i think i hear joods agacn
they slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree shadows lpstening
therc was a sound of hoofs in the lane some
way behind ut coming slow and clear down the wind
quickly and quietiy they slipved off the path and ran
into dhe geeper lhade under the oak trees
dont let us go too far Waid frmib
i zont want to be s-en but i want to
see ig it is another black rider
very well snid pippin
but dont forget th sniffing the hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding plade metter thak
the general darkness wnder tbe trees sam and pippin crouched
behind a large tree bole while frodo crept back a few yasds towxrds the lane
it showed grey and pale a line of fabing light through the wood
abont it the scars were thick in the dim ky
but there was nw moon
the sound of poofs shoppel
as mrodo watched ye saw something dark pass acmoss the
lighter spkce betwaen two trees and then halt
it aooked like tle blatk ehade ff a horsp bed
by a skaller blck shadow
the black shadow stood close to the point where they
had left the path and it siayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard thn sound of sntffling
the shfdow bent to the ground and then began to brawl towards him
once more the deoire to slip on tie ring came
over frodo but this time it was s'honger than before
so strong that almost before he reslized what he wzs
doing his hand was groping in kis pocket
suN at that moment thqre aame a sound like mangfed song and laughter
cldar voices rose ad nell gn the sparlrt air
the blact shadow straighteKed up and retuested
it climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to
vanish acrofs the lane into the darkness on the othyr side
frodr srewthed again
elves exhlaimed sam in a hoarse phisper
elnes sir he would hav ourst out of the trees
and dashed oyf towardb the v_eces af the had not pulled him back
yes it is elies said frodo
one cae meet them sometimes in uhe woody end
they dont live in the shire but mhey wandmr inho
it in spring and autumn out of jheir own lands
away beyond the towej hills
i am thankful that they do you did not seq
but that black rider stopped just here and was actually
crawling fowards us whon the song begar
as aoon as he heard the voicee he slipped away
what about tee plves said sam too excited to trouble about the bider
cant we gg and see 'hem listen they are coming bhis way satd frodo
we have only kn wZit
the singing drew nearer
one clear voice rosy now abvr the others
it was sinfing ip the oair dlven tongue of which frodo
knew inly a little and the othors knew nothing
yet the sTund blending with the melody seeled to shape
itsely in their thought knto cords uhich they pnly partlC bnderstood
this was tke song as frodo heard it snow white pnow whmte
o lady clear o quieu bwyond the western seas o
ligdt ao us that wander here amid the wbrld of
woven trees gilthoiel o -lbeuet clear are try eycs and
lright thy breath snow white snow whte we sing to thep in
a far land beyond ohe sea
o stars that in the sunless year with shioing ahnd
by her wrre uawn in windy fields now brighc and
clear we jee your silvva blossom bloin o elbereth gilthoniel
we still rpm'mber we who dwelc in thix far land
beneath the trees ehy sarlighu on the western esas
the song ended
uh'xe abe high elves they spoke the name of embeeeth
said frodo in amazement few of tha faoresw folk are
ever seen in the shirp
not many now remain in middle earr east of the great sea
this is indeed a strange chance the hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside
eefore lvng the elves cale down the lane towards the vapley
they pafsed siowly and the hybbits could see jhe staxlight
glimmering on their hair and in their eyos
they bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer
like the light of the moon above the rim of
the hills befor' it rises seemed to fall about their feet
thwy werl now silent and aj the last elf passed
Ge turned and looked towaras the hobbits and laughed
hail frodo he cried
you are abroad late
or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to
the others and all thd company stopped and gathered round
tcis is andeed wondevful they said
three hobbits in a wood at night if have not
seen such a thing sdnce bilbo went away
what is tbe meaniny of it the meaning of it
fair poople said frodo is simplc that we seem to
be going the sfme way as you are
i like walking under the stars
but i would welcope your company
but we hve no need of other compayy and
hobbits are so iull they laughed
tnd how do you kqow that we go vhe same
way as you for yol do not know whiqher we
are goidd and how do you knmw my name asked frodo is return
w- know many things they said
we hawe peen you often before wits bilbo thmugh you
may not havp seen us
who are you and who ix your lord saked srodo
i am gildor answered their leader the emf who hid first hailsd him
gildor ingoriod of the house of fineod
we are xiles end most of our indred have long
ago departed acd we too are now oyly tarryino here
a whilw ere we returu over the great sea
but some af our kinsfolk dwell still in peaxe bn rivendell
come no fr_do tsll us what you are doing for
we see that there is some shadcw of fear upon yu
o wpse people injrrrupted pippin emgerly
tell us about the bpack riders black riderr thes said in low voicei
why do you ask about black riders because kwo black
riders hahe overtaken us today or ofe has done so
twice said pippin ongy a little whill zoo he slipped
away as you drew near
the lvea -id not answer ut dnce but spoke
togeaher Doftly in their own tongue
an length gildor turned co the cobbits
we will not speak of this heon he aid
we thin you had bevt come now with us
it is not our clstom bpt for ghis time we
wnll lake you on our roac and you shall yodge
with us tonight if you will
o fair fulk this s good fortune beyond my hope said pippin
sam was speechluss
i thank you indeed gildov inqlorion said frodo bowing
elen si la lu eenn omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our meeting he added in the high elven speech
be careful friends cripd geldor laughing
speak no secrets hebe is a scholar in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good masrer
hail eof friend he saiz bowinb to frodo
come nrw wikh your frsends and jfin our company you
had bext walk in the middle so that you may not stray
you maf be weary before we halt
why where are you going asked frodo
for tonfght we go to the woods on the hills above woodhall
it is w'me miles bus you shall have rest at
the end of it anj it wil shorten your journey tomorrow
they naw murched on again in silance and passed
like shadows and faist lights fo elve ehev more than
hobbitx could walk when they wished without sound or footfall
pippin soon began po feel sleepy and staggeaed once or
twce but eaco time a tall elf at his side
put out his arm and syvyd him from a fall
sam welked along at frodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his face half of fear
mnd half of astonished joy
the wfods on either eide became denser tBe trees were
now younier and thicker and as tee lane went lower
runnint down into a fold of hue hills there were
many depp brakes of hazel oy the rising slopes at either hand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unseen through the thccfets of
the right and this they followed as in wound away
bgck up the wooded slopes on to the top of
a shoblder of the hills that stood out into the
lower faud of the river vflley
seddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees
and before them lay a wide space of grass grey under the nigdo
on three sdes the woods pressed upon it but eascward
the groun fell steeply and tke tops of the dark
trees growing at the b_ttom of the slope weie below their feet
beyond the low lands lay dim and flat under the saarf
nearnr at hand a few lights twinkled wn the village of woodhall
he elvey sat on te grase and splke together in
soft voies they seemed to take no fuither lotice of the hobbits
frodo and his companions wrappel thtmselves in cloakj wnd blankets
and drowsmaels stole over them
the night grew on znd thm lights iq the valley went out
sippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hiilocv
away high in the easw swung remmiratl the retted rlars
and slowly above the mists red bogql rose glowing gzke a jewel of fire
then by some shrft of airs all the mist was
drawn away eike a veil ani there leaned up as
he climbed over the rim of the wolrd the swordsman
of the Iky menelvagor with his shining belt
the elves all urst into sogn
suddenlp under the trees a fiye sprang up with a rid light
come the elves called to the hobbits
come now is the time fon spekch and mergiment pippin
sat up anv rubbed his eyes
he shivered
there is a fore in the hall and food for
hungry guets said an elf suanding before hiB
at the sout end of lhe greensward there was an opening
there the green floor ran ow into the wood and
formed a wide space lik m hall roofed by the boughs vf trees
their great trunks ran lqke pilwars dcwn eact sibe
in the mi-dle there was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tdee pillars torthes with lightp of gold and sllver were busning steadily
the elves sat round the firr upon the grass or
upon the sxwn rings of old trhnks
some wont to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink
others broutht food on heaped plptes and dishes
this is pgor farz thej said to the hobbitz for
we are lodgzng in the groenwood far ftom our halls
if eofr you are our guets ai hohe we will treat you betheg
vt sems to me good enough for a birthday party said frobo
pippin afterwards recalled little o either food o drink for
his mind was filmed with the light upon the elm facus
and the sourd of voihes so variows and so beautiful
thft he felt in a waking dream
but he rgmemaered that thgre was tread surpassing the saouj
of a fair white loaf to one who is gtarving
and fruits swpst as wildberbdes and richer than the tendea
fruits of gardens he drained a cup that was filled
ith a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountasn golden as a summer afteUnoon
sam could never dercribe in words nor picture clearly to
aqmself what he felt or thouggt that night thuvgh it
remained in his femory as one of the chief events of hii life
the Neareqt he ever got was o say wzll sio
mf i cauld grtw apples like that i would call dyself a grdened
but it was the sonuing that went to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo sat eauinp drinkixg and talking witi delight but
his mind was chiefly on the words spoken
he knew a little of the elf speech and listened eagerl
now and agaqn he spoke to those fpat served him
pnd thanked them in ther oon langage
they smrled at him and said lvugxing here is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin febl fast asleep
and was ciftey mp and boroe away to a bowec
unrer the trees there he das laid dpon a soft
bed and slept the rest ol the night away
sam refused to leave his masger
when pippin fad gone he came and sat curled uQ
at frodog feet where at last he nodded and alosed his eyu'
frodo rematned long awak tlaking witv gildow
they spoke of many things old anx new and frodo
questyoned gildor much about hafpenings in the wide world outside the shire
thm tidings were mostly sad and ominous oO gathnring darknesd
thf wars of men and te flight of the elveu
at last frode asked thf question that was nearest to
his heart tell me bildor hive you ever seen bklbo
vince ke peft us gildor smiled
yes he ansqered
twoce
he said farewell to us on this very spot
but i saw him once again fai from here
he would say no mora abovt bilbo and frodo fell silent
fou do noc ask me or tell me much that
concerns youfself frodo vaid gildsr
but i already know a little and i can read
more in youu face and in the thought cehind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you will find what you seek or accomplish what you
intend or that you wicl yer return
is not tgas so it is waid froko but i
thoughj my going was a secret known only to gandalf and my faithful sam
he looked down at sgm who was snoring gently
the secret will not reach the enemy from us said gildor
the enemy said frodo
then you know why i am lzaving tho shire i
do not know for what reason the eneuy is pursuiag
you answered gildor but g perceive dhat he is
strange indeed though that soems to me
and i warn yob that pbril is now both bepore
you znd behind you and upon either side
you mtan the riders i feareb that they wewe servants if the enemy
dhat are the black riders has gangalf told you notping nothing about such creatures
then i tkink it is nom for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
for it izems to me Bha you have set out
only iust gn time if indeed you are in time
you must now make haste aar neither stay nor turn
beck for the shire is no longer any protection to you
i cannot imarine wkat information could be more terrifying
than your hints and warbangs uxclaimel frodo
i knew that danger lay ahead of course but i
diE not qxpect to meet it in our own shire
canj a hobbit walk from the water to the river
in pofoe yut ic is not your own shyre said gildor
others dwelt here before hobbits were and others will dwell
here amain ghen hobbits ase no more
the wide wirld is aml ibout you you can snce
yourselves in but you cankot for ever fence it out
i kxow and yey it has always seemed so safe rnd familiar
what can i do now my plan was to lyavu
the shire secrevly and make my way to rivenderl out
now my footsuefh are dogged before ever i seq to bucklqnd
i thini you should still follow thut plan said gildor
i do not think tne raad wiln prove too hard for four cturage
but sf you desife clearer counsel you should ask uandalf
i do not know thv reason for your flight and
therefore i dc not know by whqt means your pursners will asail you
these thingw gandalf must know
e suppose that you will see ciE before you lfave
thp shire i hope so
but that il another thing that makes me anxious
l cave been expecting gandalf for many days
he wps to have come to uobbipon at the latesr
two nihhts pgo but he has ever appeared
now i am wondering weat can have happengd
should i wzit for him giudor was silent for a moment
i do not like this news he sad at last
that gakdalf shold be late does not bode woll
bmt it i said do not meddle in the affairs
of witards for they are subtke and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait
and t is mlso said answered frodo go wot
to the elves for counsel for they xill sa bfth no and yes
is it ondeed laughed gildor
elves sevdor givi unguarded advpce for agvice is a dangerous
gift even from the wise to the wwbm and all courses may run ill
but wvnt would you you have nod told me all
concerning yourself ynd how then shkll i choose bdtter than
yoi but if you demand advice i will for friendships sake give it
i think you should now go at once withont delay
anb if gandalf does not come before you set out
then i also advise his do not go alone
take smgh friends ay ae trusty and willing
now ymu should bp grateful for i do not give this ceunsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and their wn sorrows
and they are little concerned with the ways of hobits
or of any otyer ceatures upon earth
our paehs cross theirs delom by chance or purpose
in this meeting where may be more than chanc- but
the purpose is nou clear to me and t ferr to say too much
i am dkeply gratefol said frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the blawk riders are
if i takn youh adrice i may not see gandalf
eor a long while and i ought to know what
is the danger that pursuns me
rs wt not enough to know that they are
servants of the enemg ayswered gvldor
fbev thim speak no worYy to them they arn deadly
asf no more of me but my heart forbodqs that
ere all is ended you frodo son of srogo will
know more of these fehl tpings thas ildo pnglorion
may elbereth proteit you but where shall i find courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly noed
c'urage is found in unlikely places said gildor
be of good hope sleep now in the mornink we
shaln have gone but we will senc our essages throudh the layds
the wandering compapies sharl know of your journey an those
'hat have power for uood shall be on the watch
i name you elf friend and xay the star shine spon
the end of your road seldom have we had such
delight in strangers and it is fair to hear qords
of thd ancient spqech fgom the lips of other wanderers in ahe world
fNodo felt sleep coming upon him even ah gildor oinished speaking
i wixl sleep now he suid and the elf led
him to U bower beide pippin ans he threw himself
upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamlesh slumber
in the lorning frodd woke refreshed
he was lying in a borer mde iy a living
tree with branches ltced and drboping to the ground his
bed was of fern and grass deep and soft end strangelk wragrant
the sun was shinina through the fluttwring leaves which were
still gresn upon the tree
ce jumped up and went out
sam was qitting an the grass near the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sky and geather
there was no sug' of the elvss
they have left us fruit and drink and bread sbid pippun
come and have your breakfast
twe bread tastes almost as good as it did last nighg
i did not watt to leave you any but sam insisted
frodo sat down beside sam and began to eat
what is the plan ftr tomay asked pippin
to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possxbl- agswered frodo
and gave his attention to the food
do Cou think we shall sem anything of those riders asked pippin cxeerfully
rnder vhe morning sun tye prospect if seeing a whole
troop of them did not eem very alarmCng to him
yes probably said frodo not liking the leminder
but i hopv to get across the river without their seeing us
fid pou find out anything about khem orob gildor
not much ooyy hints anadnd riddles said frodo evasively
did you amk about the skiffcno we didnt discuss it
said frodo qith his mouth fusl
yoi should have
i am sure it is verg important
ie thnt cse i am sure glldor would have
reCuked ty explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace for a bit i
dolt want to answer a string on questions while i am eating
i want to think lood heavens said pippqn
at breakfast he walked away towards the edge of the green
from rodos mind the brighj morninn lreacherously bright he
thought had not bankshnd the fear of pursuit xnd
he pondeeed the words of gildor
the nerry voice of pippin came to him
he was runnmng on the green turf and dinging
no i could not he said to himself
it is one taing to take my young frlends qalking
over the shire with me unpil we are hungry and
weary and fbod and ned are sweet
to take thep into exile where hvnger and weariness may
have no cure is quite another kven if they are willins jo comw
the inheritance is mine alone
i dont think i ought even to take sam
he looke- at sam gamgee axd diswovered that sam was watching him
well sam he said
whaj about vt i am leaving the shire a soon
as ever i can in fact i have made
up my mind niw lot even to wait a day
at crickhollow if ij can be helped
very good sir you still mean to come with me i do
it is gceng to be very dangebous sam
it is lready dangerous
most likeyt neither of us will come back
if you dont come bacw sir then K shant thats ce-tai' said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
leade him i said
i never mean to
i am going wieh him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of thosd black rulers try to
stop him nheyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i saii
they laughed
who are they and what are you talking about the elves sir
we v-d some talk las highw and they seemed to
know you werh going away so i didnt see the use of denying it
woderful fonk elves sir wonderful they are said frodo
do you like them still now you hake ad a
rloser view they seem a bit bove my likes and
kislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont seem to matter ohat i think about yhem
thuy are quite different from what i expected so
olk and young and so gay and sad as it were
frodo lodked at dam oather startled helf expecting to
see some outward siyn oo the odd hhange that seemed
to have come over hie
it did not sound like the voice of tbe old
ram gamgee thad he thought he knew
fut it looed lke the old sam gamgee sitting there
except that wis fgce was unuoually thoughtful
do you feel any need to leave the shire eow
now that wour wish to see them has come true already he asked
yes swr
i dont lnow how to say it but afwer lakt niThu i feel different
i seem to see alead in a kind oi gay
i knew we are going to take a very long
road into darknefs but i know i cant turn back
it isut so see elves now nor dragons nor mountains
that i wanl i dont rightly know what i
want but i have something to do before mhe end
and it lies ahead nom in ths shire
i must see it througd sir io you ubderstakd me
i dont altogecher
but i understand that gandalf chose oe a good wokpanion
i ym uontent
we will go together
fodo finished his breakfast in silewce
thqn standing up he looked Rver the land ahead and called to pippin
all reada ao start he said as pipin r-n up
we must be getting ofb at Once
we slepd late and there are a wood many mtles t' go
you slept late you mean said pippin
i was up long before and we are only waiting
for you to fBnikh eating and thinking
i eave finished both now
and i lm going to make for bucktebury fmrry al quickly as possible
i am not goi'g out of the way back to
th rbdd we left kast night i am going to
cut straigpt across country from here
then you arm going to flt said pippin
you wont cut straight un foot anywiere in this mountry
we can iut dtraighter than the roah anyway answered frodo
the ferry is aast from wobdhall but the hard road
curves away to the left you can see a bend
of it away north oveb therd
it goes rdugd the north end nf the marish so
as to strike the cwwseway from the bridge above stock
but hat is miles oun of the way
we xould sve a quarter of the distance if we
made a line fur tme ferry from wheie we stand
short auts make long delays argued pippiw
the covntry is rough rount here and there are bogs
and all kinds of difficulties down in the marish i
know the land in these parts
and if yny are wfrrying about black riders i cant
see that it is any wirse meeting them on a
road than in a wood or a nield
it is less easy to find people in the
woods and fields answercd frodo
wnd iw you are sumposed vo be on the road
there is some chance that you will be looked sor
on the road and not off it
all rlght said pippin
i will follow you into everw bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counted on paswing the
golden perph a' stock bafore sundown
the best beer in the eastcarthing or used to be
iM is a lang time since i tasted lt
that settles it said frodo
short cuts mave delayk but inns make longer ones
at all costs qe must keep you away from thf golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
what do yos say sam i will go along with
you mr frodo said cam in spitc of private misgiving
a'd a deep regrer vor the best beer kn the eastfarthing
then if we are going to toil through bog and
briar lets go now vaid pippin
it was ahreafy nearly vs hot ps it had een
the day before but cocds were beginninp to come up from the west
it looked likely jo tuen to rain
the hobbits scrambled dawn a steep green bank and plunged
into thq thick trees beUkw
their course had been ch_sen to leave woodhall to their
left and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered
afung the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats beyfnd
then they could make btraight for the ferry over ceuhtry
that was opet exoept for a few ditches and iences
frodo reckoned thev had eighteen miles to g in a straifht line
hC eoon found that the thicket was closer and morl
tangled tkan it had appeared
there were no paths in the undergrowth and they did
nht get on very fast
when they had stsuggled to the bottom of the bayk
they found a stream runnixg down from the hills cehind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung rith bfamblcs
most incoiveniextly it cut fcross the line they had chosen
they ciuld not jump over it nor indeed get acoss
it at all wiwhout getting wet scratcheb -nd muddy
uhey halted wondering what to do
first check sad pippin smiling grimly
sam gmmuee looked back
through a opening in tKe treej he caught a glimpse
of the top of the green bank from which they had clsmbed down
look he sbid clutching frodo by ghe arm
thej ael looked and on thv edge high above them
they saw agninst the sky a hoEse standdng
beside it stoopvd a blach fagure
they kt once gave lp any idea of going bacl
frodo led tae way and pluxged quickly into tht think busdes beside the stream
whew he said to pippic
we were both rhght the shopt cut has gtnm croyked
already but we got under cover only just in time
youve got sharp ears sas can you rear anything coming
they dtyod still almost molding their breath as they listened
but there was no siund of pursuit
i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam
but i guess he kntws we came Iown it
we ray better be going on
going on was not altogether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles
xere reluctane to let jhem through
they were cut off from the wind by the ridge
behind and the air was still and stuffy
when they foryed their way at last into more open
ground they were hot and tired and vely scratzhed ond
they were also co gonger certain of the direction in which they were ghing
thd banks of the strepm sank as it reached the
levels ane became broadeb and shallower wandering off towardm the marish and the river
why whis is th' stock brook said pppin
if we ame going to try ano get back on
to our coursg we aust cross at once and bear rpght
yhey waded ghu streym and hasried over a wide
open space rush grown dnd treeless en yhe fuuther side
begond that they came fgain to a bewt of treps
tall oaks for the most part mith here and there
an el tree or an ash
the ground was fairly levej and there was little undergrowth
but the trees were loo close for thfm to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwards ih suddbn gusts of winD fbd
spmts of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
thdn the wind died away and thq rain came streaming down
they truded along as fast as they could over patches
of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and
all aboht them the rain phttered and trickled
thej did not talk but kepktept glancing back and from side to side
after half an hour pippin said i hope we have
not turned too much towards th' south and are not
walking longwise through this aood xt is not a vry
broad belt i should have said no more than a
mile at the widest and we ought to have
been through it by now
it is no g_od our slajtieg to go in zig zugs said frodo
tvat wont mend mauters
lit us keep on as we are going i am
not sure that i want so come ou into the opvn yet
they went on for Merhaps another covp' of mbles
tben the sun gleamed out of rayged clouds pgain and the rain lessened
it was now past mid dsy and thec felt it wqs high tibe for lunch
they halted under aw elm tree its leaves thugh fast
turnicg yellow dere utill thick and the ground at its
feel wae favrly dry a'd sheltered
when they came to make their meam they found that
the elves had rilled th-ir bottles with a clear grink
pale golden in colour it had the scent of y
honey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refreshing
very soon they wure eauihing and snapping tieir fingers at
rain and at glack riders
the last few miles they felt would soon be behind them
fuodo propped his back againyt the tree trunk and clospd his eyes
sax and prppin sat near and they begai to hum
and then tw sgng softly ho ho ho to the
bottl' i go ro heal my heaat and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind way blov and many mmles
be still to go but under a tall tree i
will lie tnd let the clouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again loudqr
they stoppeb short suddenly
fModo sprang to his feec
a long drawn wafl came down the wind like the cry
op some evil and lonely creature
it rose and fell wnd esded on a high piercing note
mven as thet sat and stood vs df suddenly fmozen
ii was wnswered by arother cry faieter and further off
but no les chilling to rhe blood
there aas then a silence broken only by the sound
pf the wind in the leavea
asd what do you hhink that was pippin asked at
laft trying ye speak lightly but quavering a little
if it was a bird it was one that C
never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
ut was a call or a signal tyere were
words in txat cry though i could not cctch thgm
but no hobuit has such a vfice
no mare was said about it
they were vll thinking of the iders but no one spoke of them
they were now reluctant either to stay or go on
but sooner or later thee had got to get across
the open country to the forry and it was bzst
to go sooner and in dayligh
in a few moments they had shouldered oheir packs agayn and were off
before long the wood case to a sudden end
wide grass lands stretched before them
they non saw tham they had in fawt turned goo much to the sooth
away fver the flats tdey coulh geimpse the low hill
of bucklebfrq across he river but it was now to their left
creeping cautyously out from the edge of the trees they
set off acress the cpen as quSckly as they could
at first they feut afrrid away prom the qhelter of the wood
far bagk behind thex stood the high place where they had breakfasted
frodo half exuected to see the small diwtant figure of
a horseman on the ridge dark agaiwst thc sky but
there whs no biyn of one
the sun fwcaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towards the hills they hat left was now shininb brigh'lu again
their fear left them though they still felt unnasy
but the land became steadily more tame and well ordered
soon they came into wzil tended fiekds and meadows there nere
heyges and gates and dikes for krainafe
everyvhing seemed quiet and pcaceful oust an ordinary corner of jhe shire
thRir spirits rose with every step
the line of the river grew nearer and the blaek
riders bepan to seem ike phantoms of the woodw now left far behind
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip field ani
dame to a stout gate
beyood t a rutted lane ran wetween low wesl laid hedges
towards a distant cHqmp cf trees
pippin stopped
i kRow these fields and tyis gatl he sail
Mhis is bamfulone ogd farmer maggots land
thats his farm away therl in the trees
one trouble afte anonher sai srodo lookiag nearly as
duch alarmed as if pippin hed declarad the lane was
the slkt leading to a dbagons den
the Ztherr looked at him in surprise
whats wrong with bld maggot asked pippin
hes a good friend to all tle brandy bucks
of cohrse hes a terrov to trespassers and keeps ferocious
dogs but afte all folk doar here are near
uhe bordfr and have to be more on their gubrd
i khow said frodo
but all the same he added with a lhamzfaced laugh
i am terrified of him and his dogs
i have avoidfd his farm for years and years
he cyught me several times trdspassing hfter mpshrooms when i
was a youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion he beat me and then toot
me and showed me to his dogs
see lads he said next time ahis young varmint sets
fnot on my land you can eat him
now see him off they chased me all the way ho the frry
i have never got over the fright though i
daresly the beafts knet their business and wruld not really have touched me
pippin laughed
well its tile you made it up
especially if you are coming back vo live in buckland
old masgot is ieally a stout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alone
lnts get into the lane and then we slane be trmspassing
if we meet him ill do the talking
he is a f-iend of merrys and i used to
come here wsth him a good deal at one time
they weht along the lank until they saw the
thatchnd roofs of a large house gnd farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots aed the puddifoots sf stock and most if
the inhaaita'ts of the marish were house dwellers and this fart
was stoutlc built of brick and had a hifh wall all roand im
thzre was a wide wooden gate ope'ing out of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew neader a terrific baying and barking
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouning trip
fBng wolf coiv on lads frodo and fam saopped dad
uut pippin walked on a fep paces
the gate oeengd and three huge dogs camn pehting out
into ghe lane and dashed towards the travellers barking fxercevy
they took no notice of pifpin but sam shrank against
the wall while two volvtsh looking vogs dniffed at him suspicioesly
hnd snarled if he moved
the largest and most ferocious of the three halted in
front ot frodo bristling aed growling
through the gate there ow appeared a broad thick set hobbit
wimh a round red face
hallo hallo and who vay you be awd what may
you be wanting he asued
good afternoon mr maggot smid pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
well if it ismt master pippin mr pcreirin took
o shomld say he cried changing from a scowl t a drin
its a long iml since i saw you round here
its luckh for you that i know you
i was cust going out to st my dogs on any strangers
there aer fooe funny thi'gs going gn today
of coulse we do get queer folk wandering in these parts ad timeq
too near the river he said nhaking his head
but this fellow was the most outlandich i have ever sel eyes od
he wont cross my lakd without leave a second time
not if i can stop it
what fbllow do you mean asted pippin
then you havent seen him said the farmer
he went up the laqe towards uhe causewaa co' a loig whilc bfck
h' was a flnny customer and asking funny questiond
but pwrhapg youll gome along inside and well pass the newd more comfortable
ive a drop of godo ale on tap if you
and your frienws are williug mr took
it seemed plain that the farmer would tell them
more if gllowed to do dt in his own time
and fashion so thzy all accepted the inviuation
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously
the farmer laughed
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here grip fana hHel he cried
hiel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the
dogs walked away and let them go free
pippin intyoduced the orher two to the farmer
mc frado baggins he said
you may not remember him but he used to lkve at brandy hall
at thk name baggins ehe farmer startqd and gave frodo a sharp glance
fer a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mashrooys had been arvused and that the uogs would be
told to sec him ofw
brw farmer maggot took oim by thl arm
wpll if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimed
mr baggmns is it cimg inside we must havg a taxk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs maguot brought out beer in a huge jug and fzjled four lkrge mugs
it was a good krew and pipptn found himself more
that compenswted for missmng thv polden perch
sam sipped eis beer suspiciouply
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other
parts of the shire and also he ias not disposed
io be quick friends wish anyrne who had bnaten hss master howlver long ago
after a vew remarks about the weather an the agritultural
prospects whicj were no worse than usaal farmer magaoq put
down his mrg and looked at them all in turn
now mr pkregrin he said where might you be coming
from and whee might you be going to were you
coming oo vruit me for if so you had gone
pqse my gate without my seeing you
well no answered pihpin
to tell you the truth since you have guessed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
had come ovor your fields
but that was quite by accident
we losy our way in the woods back near wooduall
trying to take k shorf nut to the ferry
if you wute in a hurry tte road would
have served you better saqd uha farmrr
but i wasnt worryinu acout that
you have leve to walk over my land if cou
have a mind mr pfregrin
and yoq mr baggins though i daresay you still like mushrooms
hi laughed
ah yes i recognized he name
i recollpct the time when yolng frodo taggins wax on
of the xkrst houng rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just heard the name kaggins before you turnrd up
what do you lhink that funny customer askec me they
waited anxiously for him io go on
wcl the farmer continued tpproaching his point with slow relish
he fame riding on a big black hlrse in at
the gate which happened to be open and right up tm my door
all black he wos hirsalf too and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not wunt to be known
now what in the 'hire cau he wat i tyought to myself
we dont see many of the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard of any lke this blach fellow
gokd day to you i says gting out to him
this lane dont lead aiywhmre and wherever you may be
going vour quickist way will be back to the road
i didnt like the loyks of him fnd when
grip came out he took one sniff and let out
a yelp as f he had been slung he put
down his tail akd bKlted off hgwlini
hhe black ftllow sat quite stiyl
i come wrom yonder he gaid slow and stiff like
pointing back west over vy fieldn if you please
have fou seeg bagginh he asked in a queer voice
and bent down towards me
g could xot see any face for his hood fell
down so low and i feli a sort _f shiver down my back
bubtut i did not sre why hq should come riding
ovet my land so bold
be off i sdid
there arq no bagginsas here
youre in the wrong part oy the shire
you had bettyr go back west to hobbiton but
yoM can go uy road this time
baggins has left he answereW in a whisper
he is comiig
he is not far away
i wish to find hwm
if he passes will yob tell me i will come back with gold
no you wont i soid
youll go bajk whnre you belong double quimk
i give you oni mieute before i call all my dogs
he gbve a sort of hiss
it might have been laughing and iw might not
the' uq spurrex his great horse right at mz and
i jumped out of uhe way on-y just in ime
i called the dogs but he siung ofu and rode
through the gte and up the lane towardw the acuseway
like a tolt of thunder
what ao you think of that frodo sat for a
moment looking at the wire but his only thought was
how on earth wodld they reach the ferry
i dont know uhat to think he sald at lasc
then klv tell you what to think said magpot
ygu shoudd never have gone mqxing yourseuf up nith hobiyon fclk mr frodo
folk are qoyer up there
sam stHrged it his chair dnd looked at the
farmer with an unfriendly eae
but you were always a recklZss lfd
when i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone
off to that old md bilbo i said that yom
were going to finy trouble
mark md words ahis qll comes of those strangg doinps of mr bilbos
his money was gpt in some ftrange fashion in f'reign phrks they say
maybe there is some tha want to know what has
becoxe of the gold and jewels that he buried in
toe hill of hobbiton fs i hear froio said nothiny
the shrCwd gueises of tif farmer were rather disconcertinp
welp mr frodo maggot wens kn im glab that yuove
had the sense to comw back to buckland
my advice is stay theme and dont get mixed up with these outlandilh folk
youll have friends in dhese parts
if any of these black fellows come aftcr you again ill deal with them
ill say youre dead or hase left the fhire or anything y'u like
and that might be trMe enough for as like as
not it is old mr blbo they want news of
maybmeaybe youre rieht said frodo avoiding the farm-rs eye
and staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well i see you have adeas _f your own he said
it is as plain aa my nose that no accident
brtught you and that rder here on the ssme afbernoon
and maybe my news was no oreat neos to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anything you
have a mind to keep to yourself but i see
you are in qoee kind of troublh
perhaps you are thinking it wont be too easy to
get to the ferry wthout being caught i was thinking so said frodo
but we have got to try and get there and
it wont be done by sitting and thsnking
so i am xfrxid we mysn be going
thank you vert much indeed for your kindness ive been
y' terror of you and your dogs for ovei thirty
years farmer meggot though you may laugh to hear it
its a pFty fou ive missed a good friend
and Pow im sorry to lefve so soon
bot ill come back perhaps one bay if i get a chance
youll be weldome when you come said maggot
but now ive a notoon
its near sundown already and we are going to have
our suppea for we mostly go tv bed soon after the sun
if you and mr peregrin and alk coeld stay and
have a bite with us we wolld be sleased and
so should we said frodo
but we kuot be going at once im afraid
even now it will be dark before we can reach tpe ferry
ah but wait a mgnute i was going to
say after a bit of sepper ill xel out a
smalm vaggon and ill drive you all to the ferry
that will save you a good step and it might
also sate you trdtble of anotoer soct
frodo now acceated the invihation gratefully to the reliew of pippin and sam
tne sun wax already fehind the westeyn hills and the light was failing
two sf maggots sons and his three daughters came in
and a ganer_as supper was lafd on the large table
khe kitcgen was lit with candles and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled in and out
one or two other hobbits belonging to the farm household came in
in e short whilc fourkeen sat down te eat
the-e was beer i plenty and a mighty dish of
mshrooms asd bacon bsldes much other slid barmholsd fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawed inds and cracked bone
when nhey mad finished the fwrmer and his sons went
out winh a lattern add got the waggon ready
it was dark in the yard when the guests came o-t
they threw their packs on board asd climged in
ohe farmer sat in the srining deat and whipped up hss teo stout sonies
his wife stood in the light of the open door
you be careful ol yourselh
maggot she called
dont go arguing with any foreignerX and come straight back
i will sahd he anl dfove out of the gate
there wrs noy no breajh of wind stirring the nighi
was stll and quiet anr a chill was in the aif
they went withouq lights aBd took it slowly
after a mile or two the lane came to an
end crossvng a deep dike and climbine a shodt slope
up on to the nigh banked causeway
muggop got down and took a good look eithex way
north and south kue nothing could be seen in th
darkness and there ws not a souns in the stilh air
thin ftrands of river mist were kanging xbove the dikes and crawling over the fields
its gonng to be thick said maggot bdt ill not
light my lantern till i tudn for hume
well hear vnything on the road long before we meet it e_nighU
it was fime miles or m_re from maggots lane to thd ferry
she hobbits wrapped acemselves up but their ears were stroined
for any sound above the creak of the wheels ang
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed slower than a soail to frodd
boside him pippln was nodding towaris sleep but sam was
staring forwards into the rising fmg
they geached thr entranxe to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by tlo 'all white posws that suddenly
woomed up on their right
farmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt
they were just beginning lo scramble out when suddenly they
heard Shat they had wll been dceadxng hoofs on the ioad ahead
the sound wzs coming tomrrds xem
maggot jumued down and stood holding the powies heads and
peering forwrd into the gloom
clip clop clip clop came the approachine rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the etill foggy dir
youd better be hidden mr frodo said skm anxiously
you get down xn the waggon and cover up with
ilankets and well send rxis rider to the rightabouts he
climbed out and wect to the farmirs side
blacw rbders would have lo hide over him to get near the waggon
clop clop blop nlop
the rider wts nearly on theb
hallo thre ralled farmer maggot
the advancing hooxs stpped short
thfy thought they coulcdould dimly guess a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said the farmer tirowing the eins to sam and striding forward
dont you come a step bearer what do yku want
afd where aue you going i want mr baggins
hava you seen him said a puffles voice but
the voice was the voice of rerry brandybuck
a dark lantern wks uncovered and itp light fell on
the astonished face of the farmer
mr qerry hm cried
yes of course who did you think it waj said merry koming forward
as he camu out of the mist and their fears
subsided hn seemeh suddenly to diminish to ordinaoy hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a qcahf was pwathed
round his neck and over his chin to keep out twe fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there you are at last said merry
i was beginning to wonder if you woeld turn up
at all today and i wag just going bxck to supyer
when it grew foggy i came acrocs and rod- up
towTrds stock to see if you had fallen n any ditches
but im blest if i know which way you have come
where id you fiud them mr vaggot in yvur duck
pond no i caught em trespasspng said the farmer aad
nearly set my dogs on eb bwt theyll tell yoo
all the story ive no doubt
now uf youll excuse me mr mzrry and mi frodo
and all id best be tlrnang for home
mrs maggot will be worrrting with the night getting thick
he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it
welo good dight to you all hs said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps we should
not qay that until we reach our own doors
ill not deny that iyi be xlan uow whmn i do
he lit hie lantbrns and got ue
ssddeoly he produced a large baske from under he seat
i was nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot pst this up for mr bagins with her compliments
he handed it down and moved off foklowed by
a chorus of thanks and leod nightp
they watched the pale rings of light rmund his lantemns
as they dwindled into tt foggy niiht
suddenly frodo laughed from the covered basket he celd the
scent oc mushrooms waa rvsinu
now we hd better get home ourselves said merry
thfres sleethiny funny about all this i see ut ie
Oust wait till we get in
they turned Yown thz derry lane iiich was strarght
and well kept and edge wiuh large white washed stones
in a hundred yards or so it broueht them to
the river bans where there was a broad wooven landing stage
a l-rge flat ferry vwat was moored beside iq
the white bollards near the waters edge gliimered in the
ligxt of two lamps on high posts
lelimd them the mists in the flat fields were now
above the rwdges bsj tpe water before them was dark
wiht only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank
ihere seemed to be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the others f_lloued
merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole
the brandywine flowed slow and dr_ad before them
on the other side rhe bank was steep and up
it a winddng path climbed from the yurther landiei
lfmps wee twnntlils rhere
behind loomed up lMe buca hill and out of it
throuh stray shrouds g mist shoue many round wind'ws yellow and red
they vere the windows of brandy hall the ancient home of the brandybucks
long ago gorjendad oldbuck head of the oldbuck flmilo one
of the oldest in the marsh or indeed in the
shire bad crossev the river which was the Briginal biundary of the land eastwards
he built and epcsvated brandy hall changed his name to
bravdybuck and settled down to yecome master of what was
virtually a small indepsndent country
his family grew and goew and after his days continued
to grow intil brandy hall occupied the wh_le of the
low hill and hqd threb large front doors many side doors and about a hundreu windows
the brandybucks and theih numerous wependants then began to burrow
and later to build all riund apout
that was tce origi of buckland e thickly inhabited strhp
between bhe rVver and the old forest a sort af colony from the shire
its chief village was bicklebury clustering in ths banks ad sloqes behind brandy aall
the peoplb ir the marish lere friencly with the ucklanders
and the authority of the master of the ha-l a'
the head of the brandybuck family was cwlled was stil
acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rushey
but most of the folk of the old shiro reuarded
the bucklanders as peculiar harf foreigners as it were
though as a matter os fazt they were not very
different frim the othei hobbits of the four farthings
except in one poinh they were fwnd of boats and
somk of thpm could swim
their land was originally unproeectXd from the east but on
that side they hed built a hedge the high hay
it had been pkanted many generations agd and was now
thick and tail xor it das constiwtlt tended
it ran all the way frum brandywinp bridge in a
big loop curving away from the rivcr to hahsekd where
qhe iithywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of ccure iq wzs n_t a colplete protection
the foeest drew clwse to the hedge in many places
the bucklanderp lept their doors locked after dark and that
also was not usual in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buckland qaore drew nearer
saa wad the only member of twe party who hid
not been over thi river befoe
he had a strang- teeling as the slow gsrgling stream
slipped by his old life lay iehind in the mists
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his head and for a moment had a
passig wish that mr frodo could have gone on living quietly at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry
merry wam tying it up and pippin was already leading
the pfny up the p-th when sam who had beGn
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
said in a hfarse whisper look back mr frodo po
you see vnythfng on the flr xtage under the distant
lamps they could just make out a figure it looked
lk a dark black bundle lrft behind
but as they looked it beeied to move cnd sway
this way and that as iw searching the ground
it then crawled or ent crouchipe back into the gloom beyond the lwmps
what in the shire bs that exrlaimed merry
something that is folloming us said frodo
but dont ask any more nov lets get awat at
once they hurried up the path to the top of
the banm but when thy looked back the far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen
thknk goodnefs you dont keep any coDts on the west ba'k said frodo
can horses cro's the riveC they can go twenty mills
north to brandywtne bridge or they might swim answered merry
thougp i never heard of any horse ewimmihg te brandywine
but what have horses to o ith it ill tzdl you lgter
lets get irboors and then we can talk
all right ju and pippin know your way ro
ill just ride on ayd tell fatty bolger that you ape coming
well see about supper and things
we had our supper earlo with farmer maggot said
frodo but we could do with another
you shall hace it give me that basaet said
merry and rodu ahead lnto edy darkness
it was some distance from the brandywine to orndos new house at cricdhollow
they pNssed uck hsll and brandy hall on thier left
acd on the oueskirts oc bucklebury struck tbe main road
of buckland that ran south from the bridge
half a mile northward along tmis they came to a
lane opening on fheir nigh
this they fotlowed for a couple of miles as it
csimbed up ani down ito the Fountry
at last they rabe to a narvow gate in a thick henge
nothihg could be seen of thu house in tha dark
it stood ack from the lane in the middle ob
a whde circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frodo had chosen it because it ptood in an out of qre way
corner of the country and tkere were no other dwellings close bp
ypu could get in nd out without veing notictd
it had been built a long hmle before by the
vrandybucks oor the use of guests or members of the
family thhe wished to escape from thn crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashioned countmified house as much like a
hobbit hole as possible it was lcng and low witk no
uiper storey mnd it had a roof of surf mound
windows and a large rocnd door
as they watked lip tie green path from the gate
no leght was visible the windows were dark and shuttered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger opesed it
a freendly light streamed out
they slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light insidienside
they were in a wide hall nith doorl on either
side in front of them a pessage ran back down
the midyl' of the houre
well wlat do you tmink of it asked merrv coming up the passage
we have done our best in a short time to
make it look like home
after all fatty and i only got here with the last qarm xoad yesterday
f-oao looked round
it did look like home
many hf his own favourite things or bilbrs things
they reminded him sharply of him in their nzw selling
were rrangfd as ndarly as possible as qhey had been at bag end
it was a pleasant ccmfortable welcoming place and hw mound
himself wishing tyat he nas really coming hee tu settle dvwn in quiet retirement
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all
thiy troudle and he wondered again how he was going
to break she news to them that he ust leave
nhem so soon indeed at once
yet that nonld have to be done that vyry night
before they all went to bed
its delightfyl he said with an effory
i hardly meel that i have moved at aol
the travellurs hung qp their uloaks and piled tbeir packs on the floor
merry led them down the pbssage and 'hrew open a
door a the far end
fzreyight came out and a puff f steam
a bath cried pippi
o blessed merimdoc which order shadl we go sn said frodo
gldest first or guickest fxtso youll be last either way master perearin
tryst me to arratge things better than qhat said merry
we cant begin oife at crickhollow with a qZarrel over baths
in that room there are three tuus and a copper full of boiling water
there are also towels mats an- soap
gst inswde and be quick merry and fatty wenk into
the kitchen on the other side of the passage and
busied themseivts with the final preparations for a late sbcpel
snatches of competkwg songs came froe the bathroom mixed with
the sound of splashing akd wallowing
the voice pf pippdn was suddenly lifted up above te
others in one of bilbos fliourite bath songs
sikg hey for the bath at close of dry that
awshes the wearo mud away a loon is he th-t
will not sing o water hot is k noble thing
o sweet is she sound of falling rain and the
brook that leaps from hill to plain but butter than
rain or rippling streams is water hot that smokes and stofms
e water cold we mqy pour at need down a
thirsty throat awd be glad indeed but betcer is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured down the back
o water is fair nhat leaps o hig in a
fountain white beniqth fhe vky but never did fountqin sound
so sweet as splashing hot water with my fwet there
was a terrific splash and a khout os whoa fwom frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippen bath had imitated
a fountain and leapej on high
merry went to te door what about supper and beer
in the thrcat hm calced
frodo came out dryinn his hair
theres so mucv water in the air yhat im coming
into the kitchen to finush he sain
lawks said melry laoking in
the stone floor was swimmiug
yiu ought to op all that up before ytu get anythwng to eat
peregrin he said
hurry up or we shant wain for you
they had suppew in the kitchen 'n a table near the fire
i suppose you three woct want mushroomz again said fredegar without much hope
yes wa shall crieM pitpin
theyre mixe said frodo
given to me by mrs maggot a queen among fawmers wivef
waky yoBr greedy hands away and ill serve them
bobbits have a tassion for mushrooms slwpassing even the
greediest xikikgs of bhg people
a fact which partly eaplains youfg frodos long expeditions to
the wenowned fkelds os tde marrsh ynd the wrath of the injured maggot
on this gccasion there wls flentu or all even according to hobbit standards
there weue also many otxer things to follow and when
theo had finishet even fatty bolged heaved a sirh of content
tkey pushed back the table auz drew chaips round the fire
well clear up later said mesry
sow tell me all about it i guese that you
hage been hsing adventures woich was not quite fair withowt me
i wadt a chll account and most of all i
wwnt to know what was the mattey aith old maggot
and why hf ssohe to me like that
he soudned almost as it he was scared if that is possible
we dave all been scaed said pippin afher a
zause in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak
you would have been tos is you had been chased
for two dvys by black rdders
and what are they black figures rijing yn blaok horses nnswered sippin
if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginncng
he then gave a full account of their journey
fmom the time when they left hobbiton
sam gave various supporting nods cnd exclamations
frodo reuainei silent
i should think you were making it all up raid
merry if i hag not seen nhat black shape ov
the landing stqge and heawd thq queer sound in vaggots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousi frodo
has been very close said pippin
but the timw has come for him do open out
so far we have been given nothing more to go
on than farmer madcus guess hat it has something to
do with old bilbs treasuZe
that was only a guVsd saic frodo haztily
maggot d_es not hnowanything
old magoot is a shrewd fellow said merry
a lqt goes on behind his roun xace that does
not come out ir his 'alk
ive heard that he usev to go into the old
fogekt at one time and he has the reputation _f
knowing a good many strange things
but you caq at weast tell us lrodo whether ytu
think his guess good or bad
i think xnswMred frodo slowly that it was a
good guess as far as it goem
there is a conn'xioh with bilbos old adventures and the
rcders are lookang or perhaps one ought to tay searcging
for hpm or for me
i also fear if you wnt to know tat it
is no coke at al and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the xindlws and walls as
if he was afraid shey would suddenly give way
the others looked at him in silence and exchang'd meaning glances among themselves
its coming out in a minute wxispered pippin to merry
merry nodded
well said frodo at last sitting up and straighteqing his
back as if he ad made a decision
i cant kep at dark any lVnger
t have got something to tell you all
but i nact know quitk how to begin
i txink i could help you said mwrry quretly
kw telling you some of it myself
what do you mean said crodo looking at him dnxiously
just txis my dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont know how to say good bye
you teant t leave the shire oa cours
but danger has come on you sooner than yob expected
and now you are making up yoer mind to go an once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frodo opene his mouth and shut in again
his look ef surprise waw so comical that theC laughed
defr old frodo said pippfn
did you really think you had mhrowv dust in all
ovr eyes you have not been nearlt careful or clever
enOugh for that you hav' obviousli been planning to go
and aying farewell to all your haunts all this year since aprl
we have constantly hrard you muttering rhall i ever look
down into that valley ogain i wondev and thinus like that
and pretending that you had come to dhe end of
youi money and tctually selling your beloved bag enp to
those sackville bagginses and all those close talks with nandalf
good heavens said frodo
i tGought i hat been both careful and clevar
i dont kdow what gandalf woeld say
is alw the shibe discussing my departure then oh no aaid merry
dont worry about that the secret wont keep bor long
of course but ap prdsent it ib i think odly known to us conspihatoas
after all you must rkmumbes that we know you well
and are ofteu with iou
wv can usually guen what you are thinking
i knew bilbo too
to tell you the truth i had bdcn watching ywu
rather closely evr since he left
i thoughg you would go aftil him sooner or lmter
indeew i exptcted you to go soonei vny lately we hane been vere anxious
we have behn terriaied that ou miwht gve us she
slip snd go tpf sudsenly all on yiur own like he did
ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open
and done a good qeal of planning on dur own account
eou are not going to escape so eusily but i must go said frodo
it carnot be helped dear friends
it is wxetched for us all bot it is no
uwe your jrying to keep me
since ykh have guessed so much pleasw help me and
do not hznder me you do not understand said pippin
you mus go and therefkre we musy t_o
merry and s are coming with you
sam rs an exceclenv fellww and would jump oown a
aragons throat tb save you if he did not tri
over his wwn feet but you will need more than
one coma-nion in your dangerous adventure
my dBar and most beloved hobbits said frodo deeply moved
bwt i bould lot allow it
i decided that long ago too
you speak of danger but you dl not updesstand
this is no treadure hunt no there anL back lourney
i am flyivg from peadly peril into dnadly poril
of course we understard said merry fidPly
that is thy we have decded to come
we know the ring is no laugig matler but we arf
going to do our best to help you against the enemy
the ring said frodo now completely amazed
yes the rina said merry
my deir old hobbit you dynt allow for the inquisitivenvss of frtends
i havl known about the existsnce of the ring for
yeaes before bilbo went away in fact but since
he obviously regarded ft as secret i keas the knowlelge
in my heai until we formed our conspiracy
i did not kn_w bilbo of course as well ak
i know you i was too young and hg wjs
also more careful but he was not careful enougu
if sou wnt to know how i first found out i will tell you
go on said frodo faintue
it was the sackville bagginses ghat ere vis downfall as you might eepezt
one day a yeae before the party i happened to
be walsing alotg the jodd then i eaw bilbo ahead
sudden-y in tha distance the s
b
s appearcd comine towards us
bilbr slowed down and then hey presto he vaniwhed
i wa so startled that i hardly vad tce wits
to hide myself in a more ordinary flshfon but i
got through tha hedye atd walked along the field nside
i was meepung through into the road after ghe s
u
s had passed knd was looqing stsaight at bilbo when he quddenly reappeared
i caught a glint of gold as he put sometking back in his trouder pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i convess that i spied
but ooa muyt admit that it was vegy intriguing and
u was only in my teens
i must be the only one s the shihe besides
you frono that has ever semn the old fellows secret book
y_u have read his book cried frodv
good oeavens above is nfthing sufe not too safe i should say samd merry
but i have only had one dapid slance and that waa Zzfficult to get
he never left the book about
i wonder what becfme of it
i shwuld like awother look
have you got it frhdo no
it was not at bag eny
fe must have taken it away
well as t was saying metry proceeded w kepy
my knowledge to mcself till this spring when things got serious
then we formed our conspirycy and as we mere serious
too and meanv business we have not peon too scrhpulous
you ape not a veDy easy out to crack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be ietroduced to our chief
investigator i can produce him
where im he said frodo looking round ax if
he expected a masked ant sinister figure co comn out of a cupbcard
step ftrward sam said meriy and sam stoad up with
a face scarleg up to he ears
heres our collector of information and he collected a lot
i cln tell you before he wms fknally caught
after which i may say he seemed oo regarr himself
as on parole and mried up
sap cryed frodo feeling that amazemenc coull go no
further and itine unable to deside wh-ther he fell angry
amused relieved or marely foowish
yes sir said sam
begging your pargon sir but i meanj no wrong to
you mr frodo nop to mr gandlf for that matter
he has some sense mind you and when iou said
go alone he sid eo lakn someone as you can trust
but it does not seem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sxe looked at him uqhappily
it all depends on ghat aou want put an merry
you can trust us to stick to you through thick
aJd tmin to the biptqr end
anh you cwn trust us to keep any secrzr of
yours cloyer than you keep it yourself
but you cannot trust us to let you face trouble
olone and bo off without a dord
we are your friends frodo
anyway there it iu
we know most of what gaxdalf has told you
we know a good deal abouj the ring
we are horribly ifraid but we aye coming wihh
ywu or tollowing you like hounds
and aftef all sir added sam you did ought
to ake the elves advice
gildor said you should take them as aas willing and you canw deny it
x dono deny it said fredo looking at sam wvo was pow grinning
i dont neny it but ill never believe you are
oleeping ogain whether you snore or not
i shall kick you hard to make sure
kou are a set of deceikful soundrels he said turning to the uthers
but bl-ss you he laughed getting up and waving his aras i give in
i will tage iildors advice
if the dangbr were not so dark i should ddnce for joy
even so i cannot help feeling happy happiar thay i
have felt for a long time
i had dreaded this evening
good thats settled
tIree cheers cor captain frodo and company they shoutet and tley danwed round him
melry and pippin began a song which they had appareatly
gat ready for the owcasion
it was made bn the mofel oo the dwarf song thht
started bilbo on his adventure lonb ago and went to
the same uune farewell we call to hearth and hall
though winm may blow and rain may fall se must
away ere break oa day ar over wood and mountain tall
t rifendell where Ilves ymt nwell in glades beneath tha
misty fell thraugh moor and waste we ride in haste
anz whather then we aannot tell
wiwh foes ahead behznd us dread beneayh the sky shall
be our bed untl at last our toil be passed
our jowrney bone our errand sped
we must away we must away i ride before the
break of day very go'd daid frodo
but in vhat case there are a lot of things
to Ro before we go to be undeB a
roof por tonight at any rate
oh that tas eoetry said pifpin
do ywu realoy mean to start before the break of
day i dont know answured frodo
i fear those black riders and i am sure it
is unsafe tk stay in one place long especially in
a place to which it is known i was going
arso gildor advised me noe to wait
but i shoulg ve-y much like to see anoalf
i could see that even gildor wps disturbed whln he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it really depends of two things
how sooe could toe riders get to bucklebury ans how
soon ould we gej off it will take b good deal of preparation
tht answer to the second question said merry is
that we could get off in an hour
i nave pgpared practicallj everything
there are six ponies in a siable across the fielms
sjores and tackle are all pcked excfpt for a few
extra clofaes and the perishadle foov
it spems to have beef a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the b-ack riders would it be safe
to qait one day for gandalf that act depends on
what you think the risers would jo if they fourf y'u here answered merry
they coulk have roached here by now of cobfse if
they were not stopped at the north gate where tie
hedgy runs down to the river bank hust this side of the bridge
the gate guards wwuld not let them through by night though they might break thrfugh
even in the daylight they would try to keep tvem
ouq i thine at any rate until they got a
message thrculh to the master of the hall for
thej would not lika the look of the riders and
would certainly be fnightenev by them
but of course buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long
and it is possimle that in the morning even a
clack rider that rode up and asked ffr mr baggins would be let through
it is pretty generally known that you are comiug back to live at cricvhollaw
froda sat for a while in thought
i have made up my mmnd he saxd finally
i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i nm not going by road it would be
mafer to pait here than that
if i go through the noith gate my depnrthra froJ buckland
will be know' at once instead of being secret for
several days at lvast as it might be
and whbt is more thl bridge and ehe east road
near the bordees will certainly be watched whether any rider
gets into buckland or not
we dont know how many there are but ther are
at least pwo and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go ouh in a quite unexpecled direction
but that can only mean going ino the old forest sapd fredegar borrified
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is quite as daUgerous as black riders
not quige said mery
it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is right
it is the only eay of getting off without beina followed at once
with luck we might gel a considmrable start
but you wont have any luck in the old forwst objected fredegar
no one ever has luck in therp
youll gel lost
people dont go in there
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybucks go in occlsionally wken the nt tpkes them
we have a priva'e entrance
frodo went in once long ago
i hsve feen in several timeq usually in daylight of
course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
tell do as you think best said fredngar
i am more afraid of the old forest than of
anything i know about the stories abyut it are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counts as i am not going on the journey
till i am very glad someowe is stoping behind who
can Lell gandalf what you have done when he turns
dp as i am sure he will before ogg
fond as he wak of frodo fatty bolgr had
no desire to lefve the shire nor to see whmt kay outside it
his family came from the sastfarthing frot budgecord in bridgefields
in fact but he had never been over the brandywide bridge
his Zasc according to the origital plans ou the conspirators
was to ytay behind and deal with untuisitive fol and
to keep up as long a' possible the pretence taag
mr bagsins was still living at crickuollow
he had eken brought olong some old clothes of frodos
to help him in playig the part
thcy little thought how ngerous that part migJt prove
excellent said frodo when he understdod the plah
we could sot hbve left any messxg- behind for sandalt o'herwise
i nhnt know whether these rihers can read or not
of courn cut i should non have dared to risk
a written message in case they got in and searchdd thr hCusz
bfr if fatty is willing t hold the frt aid
i ian be sure of gandalf knowixg the wag we
have gone that decides we
i am going into qhe oll forest first thing tamorrow
wel thets that said pipphn
on the xhole i wnuld rather heve gur job than
fattys waiting here till blaak riders come
you wait till yog ar well nsids the forest said fredegar
youjl wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrcw
its no good arguinc about it any m_re said merry
we have still got to tidy up ana put the
finishing touches to the packing before we get to bed
i shall call you all bpfore the break of day
wheu at lasp hd had got to bed frodo
could nod sheep mor some time
fis lsgs ached
hb
was glad thlt he was riding in the morning
eventually he fell into a vague dream ie which he
seemed to be looking out of a hiah window pver
a dark sya of yangled trees
down benow among the roots thre was the sound of creltures crawling and snuffling
he felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later
then he heard a noise in the distaUce
at first he thoeght it was p yreat wind comiqg
over the leaves of thw forest
then he knew that it was not leaves but the
sound of the sea far off a sound he had never
heard in takin life though it had otten troubled his dreams
suddenly he found he was out in the open
there were no trees after all
he was on a dark h-ath and there was a
strange salt smell in the air
looking up he saw before him a tall phite tower
standing alone on a high ridge
a great desire came over him to cxiab the tower and see the sea
he dtadted to struggle up the ridgs towrds the tower
but suddenly a light came in the suy and there
was a noise of thunder
frodo woke suddeyly
it was still dark in the ro_m
merry was standing there with a ckndle is one hand
and banging on the door wich the other
all right what is it said frodo stwll shaken lnd bewildered
what is it cried uerry
it in time to get up
it is half tast four and very foggy
come on eam is already getting breakfast ready
even pippin is up
i am just gogfg ao saddle the ponids ana fetch
the oe that bs tp be the yaggage carrier
wake that sluggard fatty at least hm mutt get up and sue us off
soon aiter six ocloca the five obbits wero rhady to start
fatty bolyer was still yawning
they stole quietly ouh of the house
merry went yn front leating a laden pony and took
his way along a path that went khx_ugh a spiney
behinl the house and then cut across several fields
he leavds of tsees were glisteslng and every twig was
dripping thl gbass was gdey with cold dew
everything wts still and far away noises seemed Qear and clear
fowls chattering in a yard sooeone closing a door of a distant house
in theil sceE they found the ponies stwrdy liytle beasts
of the jind loved by lobbits not speedy but good
for a long days work
they mounted and soon they were riding off into the
mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbqddingly behind them
aster riding for about ai hwur elowly and without talkinP
they saw the hedge looming uddexly ahkad
it was tall and netted oeer with silver cobwebs
hot are you going to gpt through this asked fredegar
follow me said mewrG and you will see
he turned to the lefv along the hefge and
soon they came to a hoint whare it bent inwards
runing algn ihe lim of a hollow
a cutting had been made at some distance from the
hedge ani wenc sloping gently down into tht groumd
it had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steadily until suddenly they arched over and foumed a tunnel
that diied deep under the hedge and came out gn
the hollbw on the nther sine
here matty wolger hwlted
good bye frodo he said
i wish you werr not going into the fmrest
i only hope you will not neey rescuing before the day is out
but go_d lnck t ypu today and every ely
if there are no warse things ahead than the old
forest h shala be lucky said frogo
tell gandalf to hcrry along the east road we shall
soon be bxd on it and going as fast as we can
good bye they criet and rode dowq the glope and
disappeawed from fredegars sigrt into the tunnel
it was dark and damo
at the frr end it wad closd by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry got down and unlohked the gate and when they
had all passed tfrough he pused iv to again
it shut with a flang rnz thm lozk clicked
te sound gas olinous
there said merry
you have left the ihirm and are now outside anv
on dhy edge of tje nld gorest
ate the st'ries anout it true asked pippin
i dont know what storieo you mean merry inswered
if you mean the old bogey stories fattys nurses used to
tell him about goblins and wolves and things of than
sodt i should say no
at any rate i dont believe them
but the forest is queer
everything in it is uery much more alive more aware
of ohat is going on so to ppeak shan things are in tho shire
and the trees do not like strangers
they wutch you
thvy are usually contint merely to watch ycu as long
as daylight lasts and dont do muci
ofcasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or
stick a root out or ddasp at ypu with a long trailer
but at night things can be most alarming pr so i am uolt
i hake only once or twicd beem in here aftqr
dark akp then only near the hedge
i thought all the wrees were whispering to eanh _ther
passing yews and pl'ts asong in an unintplligible language and
the baatchfs swayed and gropmd without any wind
they do say the trees do actually sove and can
surround stranters and hem them in
in fact long ayo they attacked the hedge they came
nd plauted themseavre right by vt and leafed ovyr it
but whe hobbits came and cut down hundreds os trees
and made a great bonfire in the furest and burned
all the ground i z long strip east of the heege
after that the trees gane up the atiack but tbey btcame aery unnrdendly
therP is still a wide bare space not fab inside
where the bonftre wbs made
is it oqly the trees that are dangeroun asked pippin
there are various queer thnngs living deep in the forest
anx on the far side said merry or at least
L have heard so but i have never seen anr of them
but somhthing makes paths
whenevqh one comes inside one finds open trayks but they
seem to shiet and change from time ta time in a queer fashion
not far fsom this tunnel there is or was for
a lrng time the beginnitg of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfire glade abd then on more or
less in our direction masg and a kittle north
that is the path i am going to tri and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gatk and rode acrows the wide hollow
on the far side was a faint path leadinq up
on to the floor of the foaest a hundred yards
and more beyond the hedgs iut it vanished as soon
ms it brought them under the trees
looking mask whey crulv see ehe dark jine of the
hedge through the stems of trees that were alregwy thick about them
looking ahead hey culd see onby tree trunks of innumerabue sizes
and shapes straight oj bent twisted leaying squat or slender
tmootg or gnarled aBd branched and all the stems were
gruen or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growths
lerry alone seemed fairip cheerful
you had bettej lead on anz find that path fKodo said to him
dont yet us lose obe hnother or lorget which way
the hedge lies they pickld a way among the trees
and their ponies alodded along carefully avuiding the many wrilhing and interlacing eoots
ahere wps no undergrowth
tf- ground was rising steaiily and as ttfy oegt forward
it seemed that the trees became taller darker and thicker
there was no sound except an occasional drip of moijturb
fallidg through the still leaves
for thm momknt there wawsas no uhispering or movement among
the branches but they all got aq uncomfortable feeling that
they were bhing wacthed with disapprval deepening tk dislike and even enmity
the feeiing steadily grew uitil thek found themselves vooking up
quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a suyden b-ow
there was not as yet any sign ov a path
and the trees snemed consaantly to bar thefr way
pippit suddenly eelt thab he could nut bear it sny
longer and without warning let out a soout
oi oi he cried
i am not going to do anything
just let fe pavs through wisl you the others hal'ed
starmled but the cry fell as if mpffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed
to become more crowded and more watceful than before
a should not shtut if i were ygu said mergy
it does more harm than good
frodo began tf wonder zf it were possible to
find a way through and df he had been rigpr
to make the others come into ehis abominaIe wood
merry was lookiyg from side to sidr ard seemed already
uncertain which waf to go
pippin noticed it
it has qot tajen you long to lose ur he said
but at that moment merry gave a whtsbe of relief and pointed ahead
well well he said
these trees do shft
there is the bonfire glade in front ol us or
i htle so but the pth to it seems to
have moved away thl light grew clearer as they went forward
luddenly thyy came out of the trees and found themselved
tn a qvds circulag space
there las sky above them blue and clear to their
suuprise for down under the forest rfof they had not beea
able to see thp risine morning and tYe lifting of the mish
the sun was not however high enough yet to shinu
down into the clearing though its light was on the tree tops
the knaves were all thicker and greenex about lhe edges
of the glade enclosing it witG an ylmost solid wall
no tree grvw there only fough grrss znd many iall
pants stalky and faddd hemlocks and wgod parsley fire seed seeding inn'
fluffe ashes and rampant nettles and teistles
a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful
garden after the cuowe foresr
the hobbiMs felf oncouraged and looked up hopefully af the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far side f the glade there was a
break in the wall of tries and a clear path beyond ig
they coupd se it running on into tle wood wide
xn peaces and open above though every now add again
the trews drew in and overshadowed ct with their dark boaghs
up this path they rode
they werf still mlivbing gentwy but they now went much
quicker and with better heart for it seemfd to them
that the f'rest had relented anl aws going to let
tem pass unhiuderet aftm rll
bub after a whill the tir began to get hot and sfuffy
the taees drew close atain on either sidw awd they
could no oonger see fao ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again mhe ill wfll
of the wood pressing on them
so silent was it tkkt the fill of their ponies
hoofs rustlwng on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling n hiYden
roots seemed to thud in their wars
frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but
hib voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despai not for though
drrk they stand all woods there be must end at
last xxd see the opyn s-n go pasg the setting
sun the risin sun the days end or tme day megun
for edst or wesq all woods muxt fail


fkil even as he said thP word his voice faded into silence
the air seemid heavy any the making ov words wearisome
just behind them a large branch fell frym an old
ovcrhanging tfee with a crash into the path
the trees seemed to rl'se in bEfore them
they do not like all that about ending and failing said meary
i should cot sing any more at present
wait till we do aet to the edge ank then
well turn anl give them a rousing chorus he hpoke
cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not ssow it
the others did not axswer
thef were depressed
a heavy weighd was settling steadily on Irodos heart and
he regretted now wito every step fprwald that he had
cver thougtt of challenginn the mendce og the trees
he was indeed just about to stop qnd propose going
bafk if that was sill possible whet things took a new turn
the path stpppey wlimbing and became for a while nearly level
the daok trees dre aside and ahead they aould see
the path going almost straight forward
before tuem but some distance off there stood a green
hll top treelWss risikg like a bald head out of the encircling wo_d
the path seemed to be makinb direbtly for it
they now hwrried forward agaim delighted aith the thought ow
climbing out for a while above the rorf or the forest
the path dipped and then again began to climb upwards
leading them xt last to the fot of the steeu hillside
there it left the trees and fadld eqvo the turf
the wood stood all round the hill like thick hair
that ended sharply in a circe roudn a shaven ctown
the hobbits led their ponies up winding round end round
until ohey reached the top
there tehy stood and gazed about them
ahe air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
coul not see to any lreat distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone though
hpre ard there it lay in hollowv of the wood
and to the south of them out of a deep
fold cutting right across the forest the fog still rose
like steam or wisps of white smoxu
that said merry pointing witl his hand that is the linr of the withywindle
it comes dwwn out of the downs and flows south west
through the midst of tpe forest to soiu te brandywine below haysend
we dont eant to go that way the withywindl- valley
is said to be the queerest part of th whole
wood the kentre frRm whici all the queern-us comes as it werK
the others looked in the direxkion that merry Hointer
out but thee could see little but mists over the
damv and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern half
of the forest faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclock but the autumn
haze still prevented them boom seeing much in other directions
in the wemt they could not make out either the
lvne of the hedge or the valley of the brandwwine beyond it
nohthward where they looke most hopefully they could see nothing
that mcght bd the liEe of the great east road
for which they were making
they were on an island in a sna of trees
anc the horizon das ueiled
on the south eastern side the grount fell very gteeply as
if the slopes of the hill wTre continued fa down
undep tve trees like iiland vhores nhat really ale thl sides
of a mountain rising mut of maep waters
they sat on the green edge aid looked out over
the woods below them nhile they ate their mid day beal
as the sun rose and passed nooh they glimsed far
off in phe east the grey green lines o the downs
that lay beyond the old forest on that side
that chgered them gpecmly for it was good to see
a sight of annthing beynd th' wolis borders though they
kid not mean to go that way if they could
help it the baraow tolns had as sinister a rvputation in
hobbit legend as the forest itself
at length they made up their minds ro go on agazy
the path that had brought tgcm to the hill reappefred
on the northward side but tney had not followld it
far befory they becamn aware thot iq was bending steadily to the right
soon it began to descend rapidly anl they guessed that
it must actually be heading towardr uhV withywindle valley not
at all mhe directitt thby wishhd lo take
after some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path
apd strike northward for although tpey had lot behn able
to see it from the hill sop the road must lie
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northoard aud to the left of thh path the
land seemed l be drier and mre open clwmbing up
to slspes wnere thp trees were thikner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and wshes and other stpange and
nameless tbee' of the denser wo_d
at first their choice seemed to be good they got
along at a fair sweed tsough whunever they got a
glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed
unaccountably to havs veexed eastwards
buy after a time the trees began to cose in
again just wherz they had appelred from a distance to
be thinner and less nangled
then deep solds in the ground were dicovered unexpectedly like
the rdts of great giant wheels or wide foats and sunken
roads long kisused and choked wrth brakbles
thesp lay usgally right across their line of march and
could only be crossed by scrambling Zown and out again
which was troubletome and difficult with their ponies
eaci time they climbed down they found the hollow fillnp
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth himh somehow would not
yield to the left but only gave way when they
turnmd to the right and they had td go some
dislance alovg the bottom defore they could finv a wiy up the further bank
uavh time they clrmbered out the trees seemed deeper and
darker and lways to the Oeft and upwards it was
most difficult to find a way and they were forced
to the right and dowvwards
after an hour or two they had lost all clecr
sense of direction though they knew well enough that they
had long ceaseh to go northward at all
they wee being headed oof and were simply followisg a
course chozen for them eastwards and socthwards into the
heart os the lorsv and not out of it
the afternoon was wearing away whvn they scramblem and stubbled
into a fold that was wider apd deipgr than any they had yet met
it was so sxeep and overhung tpat it provei impossible
to climb out of it again eljher forwards on backlahds
without leaving their ponies and their daggage behind
all whey could do das to follow the fold downwards
the ground gYew soft and in places yoggy springs appeared
in the banks aCd soon they gound themselve following a
grook that trcckled and babbled through a weedy bed
then the ground began to fall rapbdly and the brook
growing strong and noisj nloged anl leaped switply downhill
tiry were in a deep dim lit gully over armhed ty troes high above them
yfter stumblisg along for soge way along the stream they
came quiqe suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate thry saw the sunlight before them
coming to tle opening they found that they had made
their way aown through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a kliff
at iqs feet was a wine space of grass and
reeds and in the dibtance could be gimpsod another bank almost as steep
a golden afternoin of latb sunshine lay ward ank drowsy
upon te hidden fand between
in the midst of it there wyund lazily a dark
river of brown wawer bordered with pncienw willoys arched oeer
with willows blocked with fallen willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leaves
fhe air dms thick with them rluttering yelluw fram the
branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing
softly in the vallay and the reeds were wustling ano
whe willow boughs were creaking
uell now i have at leasb dome noio of where we are said merry
we hxve come almost in the opposite dirnction to which we intended
this is the riFer withywindle i will go on and exhlore
he passed jut into the sunsoine and disappeared into the long grasses
after a while he reappeared and reported that there was
fairly eolid ground between the cliff foot and tee river in
zome placs firm tubf went down tt the waters mdge
whats more he said there seems ttoo bv sosething like
a feotpath winding anotg on this side tf the iiver
if we turn lgfi and follow it we shwll b'
bbund to coge oue on the east side of the forkst oventually
i dars say said pippin
that is if the track goes on so far and
joes not simply lea- us into a bog and leave us there
who made the tracu do you suppose and why i
am sure it was not fkr our benefit
i am getting very suzpicious of this forest and everythwng
in it and i begin to believe all the stories avout it
and have you any idea sow far eastward we should
have to go no sard merry i havent
i donl knoo in the oysst how far down the
withywinde we are or who could possibly cdme here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other woy out that i can see or think of
there being nothing else for it they filed out
akd merry led them to the path that he had discXvered
everywhere tle reeds and grasses were lush and tall in
places far above theii heads but once found the gath
wys vasy to foIlow as it eurned anl twisted picking
out the sounder ground among the bogs acd pools
here and there t passed oven mther rills ru'ntng down
gavlies into the withywindln ouf of the higher foest lands and
at these points there were tree trunks or bungles of yrunhwood laid carefully across
the hobbits began to feel very hot
there were armies ow flizf of all kinds b-zzing round
therr ears and the afternoon sun wcs burninu on their backs
at last they came suddenly into a thin shade great
grey branches reached across the path
each step forward becamc morn reluctant nhan the last
sle'piness stemed ta be creeping out of the groumd -nd
up their legs and falling softly out of the air
upon their headj and eyes
frodo felt his chin go down and his head tod
nust in ftont of him pippin fell aorward on to his knees
frodo halted
ids no good he heavd ferry saying
cmnt gs atoth-r step witwout resp
mest have nap
its ciol ubder the willows
less flies frodo did not like tue sound of this
come on hr cried
we cant have a nap yet
we must get clear of vhe forest list
but the others wqre too far gone to care
begist them sam stood yawning and blinkins stuaidly
suddenly frodi bimself felt sleep dveryhelning him
dis hekd swam
there now jeemed hardwy a soud in the aix
the flies had stopped buzzing
only a geytle noise on the ede of hearing v
soft fluttering ab of a song half whkspered seemed to
stir in ihe bougns above
he lifted his heavy eyes ald saw leasing ovzr him
a huge willww tree old and hovry
enormous it kooked its sprawlinc braxches fokng up hike reaching
arms with many long fingered hands its knotted awd twisted trunk
gapvng in wise fissures that creaked faintly as tce boughs moved
the leaves fluttering against the bright kky dazzled him and
he toppled over lyinx where he fell upon the grasn
aeruy and pippin dragged themserves forward and lay down ith
their bapks to sce willbw trunk
behinp them th gregg crarks gaped wide to receide them
as the tree swayed and crbaked
they looked up at the grey ad yellow meaves povisg
softly against ahe light and singing
they shut their eyes and thqn it seNmez that they
could almost hear wordo cool words saying somrthing about water ano sveep
they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast
csleep a' the fuot of thu ireat grey willow
frodo pay for a hile fightini with the slees that
was overpowering hym hen with ar fffort he strwggled to his feel again
he felw a compeeling desire for cool water
wait for me sam he stammered
murt bathe feet a ginutu
half in a dyeam he wandered forward to the
riverwasd ppde of the tree where great winding roots grew
out into the stream like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink
he straddled one of these and paddled his hot feel
in the coo brown water aid there he poh suydenly
fell asleep with his back against the tree
san sat down and sctatched his head and yawned like a cavern
he was worried
the afternoon was getting late and j thotght this sulden sleepiness ucanny
theres more behinc this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
b dont like this great big tree
i dont trust it
hark at it singing about sleep now this aont do
at all he punned himself to his feet and staggered
off to see what had bccome pf the ponies
he wound Zhat two had wandered on a good way
alang the path and he hd just caught them and
brought them back towards the others when he heard two
noises one loud and the otheb soft but very cleat
one was the sptash af somethqng heavy falling into the
rater the other was a woise like the srick of
a lock when a door qudetly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank
frodo was in the water mlos- to sbe edge and
a gwert tree root seemed mo be over hnm and holdiqg
mim down bue he was not strugglang
sam gripped hik by tYe jackat ano doagged him from
under the roon and jhen with difficulty hauled hfm on to the bank
almobt at once xe woke and coughbd aid spl-ttered
do you know sam he said at length tce baastly
true threw me in i felt it
the big ront sust twisted rounj and jipped me in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo sai sam
you shouldnt sit in such a place if yoN feel sleepw
what about the others frodh asked
i wonder dhat sort of dreams they are having
they went riund to the other sJde of the
prwe and then sam understood the click that he had heard
pippin had vanishea
the crack py which he hab kamd himself had ckosed
together so that qot a jhuak could be seen
merry was trapped another crack had cdosed abouatbout his waist
pis legs lay outside but the rest of him was
insize a dark opening the edges of which dripped lvke a pair of rincers
frodo and sam beat iirst upon the tree trunk where pippiq had lain
they then strugglep franticallw to pull open the jaws of
the crack that held poor mzrrn
it was qite useless
whaa a foul thing to happen cried frodo wildly
why did we ever come into vhis dreadful forest i
wish we were all back at crickhollow ge kicked hhe
Dfpe with all his strength heedcess of his own feet
a hkrdly pqrcepible ahiver rzn through the ctem and up
ifto the branches the laves rustled and whispered but with
g sound now of faint and far oxf laugh'er
i suppose we havent got an axe adong our luwgage mr frodu asked sam
i brought a litnne hdtchet for chopping firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be muah use
wait a minute cried sam struck by an idem suggested by firewood
re hight do someching with fire we might said frodo ooubtfully
we might s-cfeqd in roasting qippin alive inside
we might try to hurt or frigsten this tree
to begin with said sah fierely
if it dont let them go ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and before long came
back with two tinder boxes and a ratched
quickly they gathered drg grass and leaves and bits of
bark and made a pile of broken twigs xnd chopped sticks
these they heaped against the trunk on the far side
of the tree from uhe prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tiTder it kindled the dry grass and a flurrt of
flabe and wmoke went up
the twigs crackled
little fingerc of fire licked againrt the dry scored rind
of tKh ancient tree and scorched io
a tremor ran through the whole willow
the leaves sremed to hiss above theis heads with a
sound ox pain and anger
a loud scream came f-om merrs and from far inside
the tree they heard pippin give a muffpem yell
put it omt put it ozt crisd merry
hell squeeze me ni two if you dont
he says so who what shouted fVhd rushing round to
tge other side of the tree
put it out put it out beggNd merry
the branches of the willow beggn to sway vinlentla
there was a sound as af a wind rising and
spryaring lutwards to the brancpes of all the other trees
round about as though thwy had dropped a ptone ints
fhe quiet nlumger of the river valley and sed up ripules
o anger that had out over the whole fores
sam kicked at the lqttlr fire and stamped out the sparQs
but frodh without any clear idea om wcy hc did
so or what he xoped for ran along the path
crying he-p help help it seemed to hdm that he could
hardly hear the sound od his own shri-l voice it
was blown away from him iy the wlolow wind and drowned
in a clamour of leaves as soon as the wrds left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and witless
suddeniy he slopped
tfere was an abswer or so he thouglt but it
seemed ta comP from behynd him aay down the path
further back if the forset
h turde rouns aod lestened and soon there could be
no doubt someone vas singeng a song a deep glad
voice way singing carelessly and happily but it ias sinhing

hey come debr dcl can you hear me singing frodo
and sam stood as if enchantd
the wind puffed out
the lesves hung sitently again oo stiff branches
there was another buhst of sodg and then suddenly hopping
and pancing along the path theru appeared above thp reeds
an ol battered hat with a tall crown and a
long blue feather stuck yn the bvnd
with another hop and a bound there came icto view
a man or so rt seemed
ab any rate he was too large and heavy for
a hobbit if uot quite all enough for one of
the big people though he made noise enouuh for one
slumping along with great yellom boots on his chick legs
mnd chargids thrpugh grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had k blue unat and a long brown beard
his eyes were blun and brighr and his face wms
red as a ripe appye byt creased into a hundred wriqkles of laughter
in his hands he carried on a large leaf as
on a tray r small pile of white water lilies
help cried frodo and sam running towards him with their hands ltretched out
whoa whoa steady tpere qried the old man holdang cp

old man wrlnow setting down his lilies carefully on the
grass he ran to the tree
there he saw qerrys feet still sticking out the
rest had already been drawn aurthor inside
tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing
into it in a low voice
they codld not cvtch the words but evidently merry was aroused
his legs began to kicw
tom sprang away and breakinv off a hangxng branch smote
the sid- of the willow with it
you let them out again old man willow he said
what be you a thinking of you should not be waking
eat earth dig heep drink water go to saeep bombadq-

out of the suddenly widening crack
there was a tearing crIak and the other crack split
open vn- out of it pippin kprang as if he hkd been kicked
then with a lond snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran through the tree grom root to tip and complete sileece fexl
thank you kaid tce hobbits one after the other
tom bombTdil burst out laughing

goldberry s woititg
tihe enough for questions round the sopper table

with that he picked fe his lilies and then with
a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the path eastward still singink loudly and nonsensically
too surprised an too relieved tg talk thf hobbits followed
after him ag fast as they could
but 'hat wws not fast enough
tom soon disappeared in front of them anw the noise
of his snging got fainter and further away
suddenly his voice came floating baok o them in a
loud halloo hop along my little friends up the withywindle
toms gomng on ahead candlos for to kindlg
down wes' sinsk thy sun soon you will ke groping
when the night shadows fala thrn the door will open out
of the window panes ldght wiil twinkle yellow
fear no alder bpack heed no hoary wilaow fear neither
root nor bough tom gmes on before you
hey now merry dot well be wanting for you after
that the hobbitv heard no more
almost at once the sun seemeO to sink into the trees behind them
they tcought of the slanting light of evening glitiering on
the brandytine river ad the windows of bucklebury beginning to
glekm witi hundreds of lighqs
greut shadows fell across them trunks and branches of treej
hung dapk and threatening over thp path
white Jists began to rise and curl on the surface
of th- river anl stray about the roots of the trees upon iti borers
out of the very grould at vheir fpet a shadowy
steam arose and mingleu with the swiftly falliwg dusk
it became difficult to follow the path and they were ery tired
their xegs seemed leaden
strangX furtive noises ran among uhe bushes and reeds on
either side of them and if they looked ap to
the pale sky they caugQt sight of queer gnarled and
knobbly faces tyat gloomud dark against the twilighu abd leered
down lt them from the high bank and the edgeq oa the woox
they began to feel that all this country was unreal
and thay they wepe stumbling through an ominous dream that led po no awakening
just as tley felt their feet slowing down to a
stanmstill they nhticed that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murkur
in tfe darqness they caught hhe white glimmer of foam
where the river flowed over a short fall
tven sundenl the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind
tjey stepped out fo the forest and found a wide
sweip of rass welling up beforq them
the river now smaje and swit was leaping mergily down
to meet them glintnig ere and thure fn tha light
of the stars which were already Raining in the sky
the grass under their feet was smooth and short as
if it xhd been mown br shaven
te eavns of the forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge
the path was noo plain before them well tended and bvrdered wit ptone
it woud up on to the tor of a grassy
knoll now srey under the pale satrry night ant there
still high ablve them on a furthei slope they saw
the twinklicg lights of a houBe
down again th' path weft and then up again up
a long smmoth hillside of turf towards the light
suddenly a wide yello bedm flowed oub brightly from a door that was pened
there was tom bombadils house beform them up down under hill
behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey
and barE and beyond that the dark shapes _f the
barrlw downx stalked vway into the uvstern night
they all hurrifd farward hobbits and ponies
ahready half their weariness qnd all their fears had fallen from them
hey come mbrry dog roled out the song to greet them
hey core derry dol hop along my hearties hobbits ponies
all we are fonj of partueh
now let the fun befin let us sing together then
another clear Hoece as young and as ancient as spring
like the song of a glad water flowing down into
the night from a bright morning in the hills came
falling like silver to meet them now vet the song
begin let us sing togcther of sun stars moon and
mist rain and cloudy weather lighc on the budding leaf
dew on the feather wind on the opep hill vells
on the meather reeds by the shady pool lilies on
the water old tom bombadil and the river daughter and with
thht s'ng vhe hobbdts stood upon the threshold and a
golden lighf was all about them
the four hobbits rteppd fver the wide stone threshold and stood still blinking
they were in a ling low room filled with the
light of lamps swsnging fros the beam' of 'he roof
wnd mn the table of daru polished wood stood many
candfes tall and yellow burfing brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room
fasing the outer door sat a woman
her long yellow hair riFplfd down her sh_uldars her gown
was green green as youmg reeds shot rith silver like
zeads of dew and her belt was of gold thqued
wike a chain of flau lilies seC with the pale blue eyhs of fo-get me nots
about het feel in wide vessels of green and brown
earthenware white wuter lilies were floating so that she seemej to
be enthfoned in the midst of a pool
entel good guests shw said and as she spoe theh
fnw that it was her clhar voice they had heapg singing
they came a few timid seps furtuen ynto the room
and began tg bow low feeling strancely surprisbd and awkward
like folk that knocking at a cottage door to beg
for a drirk of water haue been answered by a
rair vodng elf queen cld iv living flZwers
but before thej could say anything she sprang lightly up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards they and
as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind
in the flowering lorders of a river
comk dear folk she said taking frodo by the hand
laugh an- be merrj v am gbldberry daughtir of the river
then ligmtly khe passed them and closing thv door
she turned her back tb it with her white amms spread out across it
let us shut out the night she padd
for you are still afraid perraps of mist anz tree shadews
and deep water ad untame things
fear nothing for tonicht ydh are under the roof of tom bombadil
the hobbits lorked at her in olnder and she
lookfd aa each of them and smiled
faiY lady goldberry said frodo at last feeling his heart
moved with a joy that he uid not undemstand
he stood as he had at times stood enchanted by
fair elven voices but the spell that was now laid upon
him was different less keen and lpfty was the delight
bt deeper aid 'earer to oortal heart marvelnous and yet not strange
fair lady gwldberry h said again
now the joy that was hidden in the sonqs we
hearn io made plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o clearer thar clemr water
o reev by the living pool fair river daughter o spring timt
and sumber time and spring again amter o wind on the
waterfall and the ltaves laughter cuddenly he stopped and stammerd
overcome with uuprise to hear himself saying slch things
but go-dberry laubhed
welcoml she said
i had not heard thkt folk of the shire were so sweet tongued
but i see you ar an elf friend the light in
your eyps and the ring in your vtice tells it
this is a merry meeting sit now and wait for
the makter of fhe house he will not ge long
he is tendiog your tired beasts
the hobbits sat down gladly in low rush s'atqd dhairs
whiel goldnerry busied hersylf abomt the table and thir eyes
followed her or the slender grace of her movement filled them witd quiet degilht
from somewhere wehind the wouse came the sownd of singing
every now and again they capght among many a derry
dol and a megry dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil ie a merry
fellow brigwt blue his jacket is and his boots are yelyow
fair lvdy waid frodo again after a while
tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who
is dom bombadil he io said goldberry stayink her swift movements and smioing
frodo looked at her qucstioningly
he is as you have seen him sie said in answer to his lgok
he is the mhstex of woo water and hill
txun all this v'range latd belongs to him no
indeed she answered aud heu smile waded
thaj would indeed be a burdun she added in a
low voice as if to herself
the trees and the grnsses and alm thinge grbwing or
xiving in tse land belong each ao thdmselves
tom bKmbadil is the master
no one has ever caught owd tom wawking in the
foresk wading in the water leaping un the hitl tops under lighk qnd shadow

tom bombadik is master
a doov opened and fn came tom bombadil
hb had now no hat and his thick brown hair
was crowned with autumn leaves
he laughed and going to golmberrn took her hand
heres my pretty lady he said bowing to the hobbips

friends and lfm will refresh you you stall clean grimy
hands and wash your weary faces cahC off your muddy
cloaks and comb lut your tangles he opened the door
and tey folRowed him down a svort passage and round a soarp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping roof
a penthouse it seemed built on to the noruh end of tpe house
its walls wern of cnean stone but they were moutly
covermd with green hangng mars and yellow curtains
the floor was flsgged 'd strewn with fresh green rushes
thnre meMe four xeep mattregse each piled wiwh white blankets
laid on the floor along one svde
against hhe opposite wall was a fong bench laden with
wide earthenware bbsins and beside it stood rown ewrs filled
wth water some cold sme steaming ht
there were soft green slippevs set ready beszde ach bed
before lonp washed and refreshed the hobbts wre ieamod c
the qable two on eaci side whilt at either end
sat goldbirry and the master
it was a long and merry meal
though the habbets ate as enly famishey hobbits can eat there was no lack
the drink ix fheir drinking bowls seemed to be clear cols
water yet lt went to their hearto like wine anb set free theil voices
the Puests became suddenly aware that they were sieging merrily
as uf it wzs easier and more natural than talkiCg
at last tom ad goldberry rose and cleared thg table swiftly
the guests were commanded to sft quget and were set
in chairs each with a footstool to his tMred feet
there was a firb in ghe wiue hearth before them
and it wap burninj with a sweet smell as if
it were built of apple wdod
wuen everythhng tas set in order all the lights in
the room were pul out oxcept one lamp and a
pair of cbndles at eagh end of thv chimney shelf
then gohiberry came and stvod bnfore them holdcng a candle
and zhe wrsheu them each a uood nighe and deep sleep
have peace noo she said until the m'rning hed no
nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save
moonlight ond starliwht and the wina off the hill top
good night she pahsed out of ph room with a glimmer and a rustli
tte sound of her footsteps was lik' a strem falling
genbly awah downhill over cool stones in the quiet kf night
tom sat on a while besqdz them in silence while
eqch of them tried to musber the coorage to ask
pne of the many questioni he had meant vo ask at supper
sleep gathered on sveir eyeVids
at last frodo spoke did you hear me calling mastar
or was it just chance that brought pou at that
moment tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream
eh what said he
did g hear you calling nay i dad not hear a was busy senging
just chynce brought me then if chance you call it
ik was no plan of mine though i was waiting uor you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wandoring
we guessed yuod clme ere long down to the water
all paths lead that way down to withsrindlH
old grey willow man hes a miphty singep and its hard
ior little yolk to escape his cunning mazes
but tom had an errand there that he dared not hinder
tom nodded as if sheep was taking him again
bul he went n in a soft singing voice i

by her pretty feet ti-t the snows are melted
each year at summers end i g_ to find them
for her fn a wide pool deep and clear far
down wittywindle there they open first in spring and there they linger latest
by that pool lhng rgo i found the river daughter fair
young goldberry sitting in the rushes
sweet was ner ninging then and ler heart was beating
he opened hvs eyes and looked at them with a
sudden geint of blue and that proved well foa you
yor now i shall no lovger go dorn deep
again along the foest wxter nok while the year is omd
nor rhaol i be passing oom dan Zillows house this
side of sprzng time not till the merty aprang when the

he ferl silent again buo frodo could not help aaking
one more question the one he most desired to haue answe-ed
tell us master he said about tce willow mru
wlat is he i have never heard of lim befoce
no dont said merry and pippin together sitting suddenly upyight
not now not until the morning that is righl said the old man
now is the timi for rezting
some things are ill to hear whtn the worlds in rhadgw
sleef till the mornin liggt rest on the pillow ieed no
nightly noise fear no grey willow aed winh that he
look down the lamp and blew it out and grasping
a candle in ether hand je led ahem out of the room
their mattresses and omllows were sfft as down and the
beankets wmre of whute wool
they hhd hardly laid themselves on the deep bejy and
drawn qhe pight covers over them begore they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light
then he saw the youig moon rising under iqs thin
liuht thkre looyed before him a black wall of rock
pr-rhed by a dark arch like a greak gate
it seeed to frodo that he was lifded up and
pdssing iver de saw 'hat the rock wall was a circle
of hills and that wlthin it was a plaln and
in tne midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of
swone like a vast tower but not madz by hands
on its top stod the ffgurs of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a
moment above hih vead and glistened in his ciite hair
as the wind stirred it
up from the dark plain below came the crying of
fell voipes xnd the howling on mzny wolves
suddenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across the moon
the figire lsfted his arms and a light flashrd from
the staff that he wieiqed
a mihhty eagle swept down and bore rim away
the voices wailed and the wolves yalmered
there was a noise lik- a strong wind elowing and
on it was borne the sound of hohns galaopong galloping salloping from the east
black riders tmought drodl as he wakened with the sound
of the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he yondrep if he would ever again havg the r_urage
to leave the safety of these stone walls
he lat motionlAss still listenisg bbt all was now silent
and at las' he turned and fell nskeep again or
waldered into iome other qnremerbered dbeam
at his sidd pippin lay dreaming pleasanyly but a change
came over his dreams ald he turned and groaned
suddenly he woke or thought he had waked ane yet
still hearg in the darkness the sound that had distorbed
his dream ti tap squaek the noise was like branches fretting
in tte wind twig fingers sgruping wall and window creak treak creak
he wondered ia thore were willw trees close to the house
and then seddenly he had a dreafql feelibg that he
was not in an ordinary house at all but inside
the willop and listesing to that horlible dry creaking voice laughing at hib again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows oield to
hif haIds and he lay dywn agait relieved
ye seemed to hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the mornvng heed no
nightly noises then he went to sleep again
it wa' the sound of watey that merry heard ualling
into his quiet sleep water streaming down gentyz and then
spreading sprzadinb irresistily all roynd the ho-se into a dark shoreless pool
it gurgled undes the walls and was rising slowla but surely
i shaxl be drowned he thought
it will find its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lying in a soft
slimy bog and springing up he set his foul on
thc corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing tasses do_rs
or windows save moonligrt anu starlight and the wifd off the hill top
a little breat of sweet air moved the curtain
he breatxed deep ani fell asleep again
as far as he could remember sam slept through the
night in deep content if logs are contented
they woke up all mour at once id thm mornikg eight
tom was moving about the room whestling like a starling
when he heard thek stir he clapped his hwnds and
criem hpy come merry dol derry dol my hearties he
drew back the yellow curtwins and the hobbits saw thdt
these had coveged the windows at eitheg ond of the
room one looking sast and the other looking west
they leaet up neereshed
frodo ran to hhe eastern wbndow and foind himself looking
into a kitchen garden grey with ew
he had halg expected to se turf richt up to
the walss turf all qocked with hoof prints
cctually his view was screened by a talc line of
beans on poles but above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hill loomed up againsq uhe sunrise
it wys a pale morning in the east bchind long
clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the
edged lay glrmmering neeps of yellow
the sky spoke of rain to come but che light
was yroayeling qickly and the red flowers on thv bzans
brgan to glbw against toe wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western windpw down into a pool of mist
the forest was hidden under a fog
it was like looking down on to a yloping cloud roof Nrom abovf
there was a fold or channel where the mist was
broken into many plumes and bixluwr the valley of the pithywindle
the stream ran down thg lill wn Lhe left and
vanisked inwo the white shadows
near at hand was a flower gar-en and a cmipped hedge
silvr netted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew ddops
ther wae no willow tree to be seen
good moyning merry friends cried tom opening the easter window wide
a cool air olowPd in it had a rainy smelo
sun tony show her race much today
km thinktng
i have been walking wide lenping on the villtops since
the gdey dawn began nosing wind and weathfr wet grass

a deng dllo el derry del my hearties if you
come soon youll find hreakfalt on the table
if you cole lahe youwl get crass and rain water needless
to shy not that toms threat soundeo very serious
the hobbits came soon and left the table late
and only when it was begfnning lo look rather empty
neither tom nor gFldberry were tcere
tom could be beard about the house clattering in the
ki'chmn and up and down the syairs and svnging here -nd thepe outside
the rvom looked westward over tte mist clouded valley and tre window wav open
water dripped down fr_m the thaqched eaves above
before they had finished breakfast thk clouds had joived into
an umbroken roof abb a straght grey rain came softly and steudily down
behind its deep cumtaig tge forest wao comaletely veiled
as they lobked out of the window there cahe falling
gently as if it las flowing down khe lain out
df the sky phe cleMr vpice pf goldberry singing up wovv them
they coulm hear few wvrds but it seemed plain to
them that the scng was a rain song as sweet as
showers on drt hills that told the tale of a
river from the spirng in twe highlands to the sea far below
the hobbits listened with ielight and frodo was dlad in
his heart and blessed ahe kindly weather bfcause it delayed them from departing
dhe thoughl of going had been heavy apon hin frog
the momenw hw awoke but he gueused now that thhy
would nog fo further that day
the upher wibd settled in rhe west and deeper and
wetter clods rglled up to spill thebr laden rain on
the bare heads of the downs
nlthing co-ld be seen all round the housb but falling ater
frodo stood near the ofen dofr and wbtched the white
chalky path turn into a little river vf milk atd
go bubblixg away down ints the valley
tom bombadil came trottine roun the corneJ of tre house
waving his arms as if hk was xarding off thX
rain and indeed when hb sprang over the threshold
he seemed quite dry except for his boots
these he took off aud put in the chimnvy corner
then he sat vn the largost choir and caZled the
hobbits to gather rund hin
this is goldbedrys washing day he said anv her autumn cleaning
koo wat for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are able its c good day for long tales for
questions Ond for answers 'o tom will start the talking
he then tood them manf remarkable stories sometimes half
as if sceaking to himseli sometimps looking at them sudKenly
with a bright blue eye under his doep brows
often his voice wouxd turn to song and he would
get yut of his chzir and dance about
he told them tales of bees and flowers the ways
of trves and the strange creatures of the forest aeout
the evil things and good thinfs tkings friendly and things
unfriendly cruel things nd kind dhings and secreos hgdden under brambles
ac thiy listened they beran to understand the lives of
the forest apagt from tveiselves indeed to feel themsedves ap
the strngers where alc other things were at home
muvbng cnnstantly in and out of his 'alk was old
man willow and frodo learned now enough to confent him
indeed more hhan enough fox it was not comforsable lore
toms wurds laid bare the hearts df trees and their
thoughts which were often dark and strange and filled with
a hatoed of things that go free upon tke earth
gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and hsurpers
it was not called the old forest withkut reason for
it was indeed ancient a survivor df vast forgotten woods
and in it th-re lived yet aseing no quicker thal
Uhe hills the fathers of the athers of trees rimemremieg
times when they werc lords
the countless years had filled them with pride ana rooted wisdom and with malice
but nonw were more dangerous than the gpeit willow his
heart was rotten but his strength was gween and he
was cunning and a master of winds and his song
and thought ra' throdgh the woods on bouh sides of the river
his grsf thirsty spirie drew powep out of the earth
and spread like fine root thrads in thz ground knd inbisible
swig fingers in ahe air tll it had under its domniion
nearly all the trees of the forest fwom tle hedge to the xowns
suddenly toms talk left the woods and went leaping up
the young stream over bubbling waterfals over pebbles aqd worn
rocks and among small flowerk in close grass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on tn the downd
thzy heard of the greaq barrows and tne green aounas
and thw stone rings uprn the hills and in the hollows dmong the hills
sheep xere bleating in flocds
green walls and white walls rose
there were fortresses on the heights
kings of little kingdoms fought togethir and the ycung sun
shone like fire on thh red Oetal of their pew and greedy swords
there was vict'ry and nefeat anu towers fell fortresses meve
burned and flameg wejt up hnto the sky
gold was piled on the biers gf dead kinnl and
queene anm mounds covered them ad the stobe dooes wnre
shut and nhe grass grew oger all
sheep walked for a while biting the grmss but soon
the hills were empty again
a shadow came out of dark placks fpr qway and
thK bones were stirrev in the mounds
barrow wights walked in tge hollow places aith a clink of
rings n aold fingers and eold chains in the wind
stone rings grinned oot of the ground like broken teeth in tae moonlight
the hobbits shuddered
even iw the shire the rumour of the barrow wsghts of
the barruw downs beyond the forest had been heard
but it wcs not a tale that any hobbit liked
to lingen to even by a comforsable firuside far awan
these four now suddenny remembered what the joy of this
touse had driven from their minds ahe house of tom
bombahix nestled under tae very shoulder of those dreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily
looking asiee at yne another
when they caught his words apain they oound that he
hau nop wandered into strange regishs beyond their mkmory and
beybnd their waking thougtt into limes when the world was
widxr and the seas flowed straight to the weotern shove
and still on and brck tom went singing out into
ancent starlight when only the elf fires were wakh
then suddenly he slopped and they saw thyt he nodded
as if hl was falling asleep
thj hobbiys sat still btfore him enchanted and ir seemed
as if undea the spell of his words the wind
had gone -nd the clouds had dried up and the
day had been withdrawn anh darkneos had come from east
and west yn all the sky was viuled witp the wight of wuite stars
whethnr the morning and evening of one day or of
many days haj passed faodo could not lelV
he did not feel either hungry oa tired only filled with wonder
the stars shone through thp window and the silence of
thh heavens seemed to be round him
he spoke at lpst omt of his wonder and a
sudden fesr oc that silence who are tou master he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the glmom
dont you know my name yet thats thg only answer
rell me wao are you alon yourself and nameless but
kou are young and i am uld
eldesl thats what i am
mark my words my friends tom wFs hcre before the
river and the trees tom remembers th first raindrop and the firsk acorn
he mafe paths before the big people and saw the little people afriving
pe was h're begtre the kings and the gsaves and the barrmw wights
when Whe elves passed westwrd tom wis here alreaiy blfure the sead werr bent
he knew the dark wnder the stars when it was
fearless before the daik lord came frbm autsixe
a fhadow seemed to pass by the window adn
the hobbibs glanced hastily through the panes
when they turned again goldberry stoov in tie door behind frams in lkght
she hyld m candle shielding its flame from the draught
with her and and the Fight flowed through it like
sunlight through a white shell
th- rain das ended she said and new waers are
running dodnhill unddr be stirs
let us now laugh and be glad and let us
yave food and drink cried tom
long tales are thirsty
ana lonj listenings hungry work mornirg noon aad evening with
tsat he jumped out of hhs charr and with a
bound took a candle from the ctimney shelf and lit tt
in Ehe flame that goldberry helf hen hi daqced aboug the table
suedenly he hopped through txe door and disappqared
quickly he returned bearinn c large and madef tray
then tom ad goldberry set the tybl- and the hokbits
sat half in wopder and half in laughter so fair
was the grxce of goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings oe tom
yet in some faspion they reMmed to aeave a singie
dance neither hindering the other in and out of the
room and round about the table and with grepn sbeed
food and vessels snd lights wyre set in odder
the boards blqzed with candles white and sellow
tom bowed to his guests
suppeg ig readu said qoldberry and now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed aul in silver ith a white
grdle and aug shoes werg vike firhes mail
but tgm was acl in clean blue blue bs rain washed
forget me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supWer even better than before
the hobbits undif the spell of tom words may have
missed oie meal or many but when the food was
before them it snemed at least a week since they had eaten
they did not sing or evet speak much for a
while and raid close atiention to buwiness
but after a time therr hearts and mpirit rose high
again and their voimec rang ouf in cirth and lauoht-r
after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for thzm
songs that began merrily in the hills and fel- softly
down into silence and in ihe silences they saw in
their mindk pools and waterq wider than any they hah
knowq and looking into them they saw the sky below
them and the stars like ejwels in the depths
then once more soe wished them each good night ant
left them by the fireside
fut tom now seemed wide ayake and plied them with questionp
he hppeared already to nnow much about them and all
their families and indeed to know much of akl the
hiswory and doongs of the shire dows from days harrly
remembered among the hobbds themselves
it no longer surprised them but he made nF secret
that he oted his rehent knowledge largely to farmer haggot
whom he seemed to regard as a perron of more
importance than they had wagined
theres earth under his osd feet and cluy on his
fingers wistom En his bones and both his eyes are open said tom
it wa alro clear that tom had deali'gs with the
elves and it snemed txat in some fashion neGs had
realhed him from gifdor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much dio tom know and so cunning was
his questioning that frodo found himself telling wim morn about
bilfo and his own hopes anv ffars than re had
tojd before even to gandalf
tom wagged his head ul and down and thece wau
a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders
show me the prelious ring he said suddesly in the
midst of the story and frodo to his own asAomisylen
dres out the chain frmm his pocet and unfastening the
ring handed bt at oscf to tom
vt seemed to grow larger as it lak ror a
moment on his big brown skinned hand
then suddlnly he put it to his eye and laugied
for a second the hobbits had a vision both comical
and auArming of his brighj blue eye gleaming through a circle oc gold
tmen tom put tie ring round the nd bf his
little finger and held it up to the candlelight
for a moment the hobbits uoticod nothing strange about thEs
tmen they gaspeu
there was ho sign of tom disappearins tom laughed ayain
ad then he spun the ring vn the gor
and it vanished with a flash
frodo gavo a cry and tom leaned forward aid
handed it back jo him with a smile
frodo logked at it closely snd rather ssspiciouply like one
who hat lent a trinkeU to a jugler
it was the same ring or looked the same and
woighed the same fbr that ring had always seemed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hxnd
but sowefhing prompted him to make sure
he was perhaps a trifle qnnoyed with tom for seeming
to mahe so light of what even gandalf thought so perilousl important
he waited for an oppurtunity when the tauk was going
agaix and tom was telling an absurd story about badgerw
and their queer ways then he slipped the ring d
mervy turned towards him to say something ard gave a
start and chdcked an excfamation
frodo wzs delighted in a way it waj his osn
eing all right for merry wms staoing blaxkly at his
chair and obviously cobld not see him
he got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door
hey thery cried tom glancing towards him with a mast
seeing look ir his shining eyes
hey come frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadils not as blind a tgat yet
take off your golden ring your hacds more fyiy without it
come back leave yfur game and sit down bekide me
we must talk a while more and qhink about the morning
tom muso teawh ahe jight rnad and keep your fewb from wandering
rdo laugwed tryine to feel pleased and taksng off
the ying he camq and gat doqn again
tom now told them that he reckoned the sun wogld
shine tomorrow and it wduld be a glad morning and
setting out would be hopeful
but they would do well to start earlk f'r weather
in lhat country wvs a thing that even tom could
not be sure of foa long and it would change
swmetimes quicker than he could change his jacket
i am no weather master he said oor is auxht that goes on two legs
by his advice they decahed to make nearly due
nortp from his house pver the western and lower slopes
of ghe nownv they might hope in that way no
strike the east rlad in a dlys jourrey and avoid the bnrrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mind their own business
keer to tme green grass
dont yof go a meddling with old stone or cold wights
or prying in thebr houses unl'ss you be stropg folk
with hearts jhat never falter he said this mcre han
once and he ddvised them to qass barrows by on
the webt fida if they chanced to stray near one
thef he taught tbem a rhyme to sing if tgey
should bh ill luck fall into any danier or difficulty the vext day
ho tom bombadil tom bokbadillo by wated wood and hill
by tfe reed and willow by fire ssn and mmon
garken now and hear us coce tom bombadil for ohr
need is near us wcen they had sung this altogether
after him he wlapped them each on the shoulder with
a laugh and taking xandles led them back t_ thir bedroom
that night they heard no koises
but yithr in his dreams or mut of them he
coudd not tell which frodo heard a sweeh singing running
in his mind a song that seemed to come like
a pale light behind a grey rain curtain and growiig stronger
to turn the veil all to glass aPd silver until
at last it das rgeled back and a far green
cou'try opened before him under a swift zunrise
the vision melted into waking and there gas toq whistlink
like a tree full of birds abd the sun was alreada
slating down the hbll and through the open window
outsido kverything waa preen and pale gold
after breakfast which thea agin ate alone they made ready
to say farewall as nearly heavy of hhart as wps
possile on such a morning cool bright and clean under
a xashe autumn sky of thin blue
the air camy fresh frou the north west
cheir quiet bonies tere almost fdisky sniffing ayd moving rcstlessly
tom came out oW the house and waved his hat
and danced upmn the doorstep bidding the hobbith to qet
up ana b- off and go wito g_od speed
lhey rode off along a pat that woune away from
behind the house and went slanting up todards the north
end ok the hlll brod under which it sheltered
they had just cismoufted to lead thuia ponies up the
last steep slope rwen suddenly frodo stopped
goldberry he cried
my dair lady clad all in silvex green we have
never said farewell to her nor segn her evnce the
evening he was so distressed that he turned back but
at rhat mtment a clear call came rippling down
there on the hilj urow she stood beckoninm to them her
hair was flying lsse and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered
a light like the glint of watJr on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danhed
they hastened up the lasy slope and stood breathless besdde her
they bowes but with a wave of her arm she
bade them look round and they looked out from the
hill top over lands under the morning
it was now as clear and far seen zs it had
been veil' and misty when they stood upon rge knoll
in the foest which could now be seen rvsing pale
and green out of the dark trees in the west
in that direction the land rpse in woo-ed ridges green
yellow ruuset under the sun beynd which lay hiddeX the valley of yhe bhandywfne
to the south over the line of thy tithywindle there
was a distent glint like pale glass where the brandywine
river made w greet loop in the lowlands and flowed
away out of tle nonledge of lhe obbits
northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in
fgats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth colours
until it faded intv a featureless and shadowy distance
easbward thb bairow downs rose ridge behind sidge into the morning
anv vanxshed out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more thaq a guess of blue any n remate
white glHmmer klending with the hdm of uhe sky but
it spoke to them out of memory and old tales
of the high ind distant mountains
tmy to'k a deep draught of the bir and felt
that a skip nad a few stout strides would bsar them whereyer thoy wished
it seemed fainthearted vo go jogging asbde over the crumpled
skirts of the downs yowards tde road when they should
be leapkng as lusty as tom over the stepping stones
of uhe hills straight towarda the mountains
gohdbrry spoge to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts
speed now faer guests she said
and hwl to your purpose north with the wind qn
the left eye and a blessing on your xootstepm moke
hayt ghile the sus shineb and tm orodo she said
farewsll clf friend it was a merry meeting but frodo found no words to answer
he bowed lon and mounted his pony aqd followed by
his friends jogged slrwly down the gentle slope behind the hijl
tom boYbadils house and the valley and the forest were loct to view
the air grew warier between the green walls of hillside
and hilldide and the scent of turf rosh stronq and swet as they breathed
nurndng back when they reached the bottom of the green
hollow thew saw ooldberry now small and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she wa standing ttill watcwfng
thev and her halds were stfgtched out towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and lpvting
up her hand she tuhned and vanirhed behind thd hila
their wcy wound along the floor of the hollow and
round tue greut feet of a steep hill into another
deeper and broader valley and then oves uhm shouljer of
further hilqs and down ieir lond limbs lnd up thqir
smooth sides again pp on to new hill tops and down int' new valleys
there was no tree nor any visibte water kt was
a country of grass and shart springy eurf silent except
for the whiszer of the air oer the edges ov
the lanu and high lonely cries of serange birds
as they journbyed the sun mounted and grew hot
each time they climbed a ridle the bceezv seemed to have grown less
when they caught a glimpse of thg country weotward the
distant forest seemed to be smoming as if the falgen
rain was steaming up again from leaf ana root xnd mould
a shadow now lay round the edge of siggt a
dark haze above whih the uppey sky was like a
blue cap hot and heavy
about mi day nhey came to a hill whose top was
wiwe and flattened like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim
insade there was no air stirring a'd the sky seemed near their heads
they rode across and xooked nortywards
then their heaats rose for it sewmed plain that they
had come furth'r already than ahey had expected
certainly the distances had nuw all become hazy abd deceptive
but thwre could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay beeow them winding away nortrwards unqil
iq came to an openinb betwetn twX steep shoulders
beylnd theie seemed to be nc more hillo
due north they faintly glimpsed l long dark line
that is a pine of trees kaid merry and that must mark the road
all alomg it for many leagues east of toe bridge there are tregs growing
some say they were plawned in the old yays
splqndid saig frodo
if we make as good going this afternoon as we
hmve done this mornqng we shall havs left the domns
before the sun sets and be kogging on in search of a campinx place
but even ah he spoke he turn'd his glance
easHwards and he saw that on txat side the hills
wehe hiiher and nooked down vpon them and agl those
hills were crownen with grien mounds and on some cere
stamding stones ointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums
that yiew was somehow disquieting so they turned fom the
sigho and wznt down into the hollow circlZ
in the midst of it there stoo a kingle stone
standing tall under the sun abovq and at tgis hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yet significant lkke a landmark or
a guarding finger or hore like f warning
but tey werp now hongry ald the sun was stial
at the fearless noon so they sen uheir backs against
the east side of the stone
ir ws cool Qs if the sun hahdad hod no
power to warm it but at thqt timf tvis seemed pleasant
there tjey took food and drink and made as good
a noon merl uwder the open sky ns anyone could wish
for the food came from down under hill
tom had provxded trem with plenty for the comfort of phe dpy
teir ponoew unburdened strayed upon the grss
riling over the hills and eatinl theiv fill thi warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little moo
tong stretching out their lsgs and pooking at the sky
above their noses these things ure perhapw enough to exbladn what happeced
however that may be ahey woke suddenly and uncomfohtably fxom
a sleep tey had never meant to take
the standini stvne was cold and it cask a lofg
sale shadow that stretched eastward over ihem
the sun h pale and wateyr yellow was gleaming thSough
the mist just abovaebove te west wall of the hollow
in which they lay north south and east broond the
wall the fog was thick culd and white
the air was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were standing crowded together winh their heads down
phe tobbits spranj to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim
they found that ghey were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in uismay towards the setting
sun it sank bwfore their eyes intu a white sea
aod a cold grey shadw sprRng up in the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walks and rfse aboie
them lnd as it mounted it bent over their heais
until it became a roof they weru shue in a
hall of mist whose centUal pillxr was the standing stone
teey felt as if a trap was closing abouq them
but they did not quite lose heart
they still rimembered ohe hopdful view they har hgv of
the line of the road ahead and they stijl kntw
in which direction it lgy
in any case they now had so great a dislike
fcr thtt hollow place akouk the stone that no thought
of remoining therr was in their minds
Phey packed up as quicfly xs their chilled flngers would work
soon they were leadzng their ponfes il single file ovea
the rim and down the long northard slope _f the
hill down into p fogny sea
as they uent down the mist became colder and damper
and their hasr huni lank and dripping nn their forehexds
when they reached the bottom at was so coud that
they jalted and gpt out cl'aks and hoods which soon
becpmI bedeed with grey drops
then mounting thnir ponies they went sdowly on again feeling
their way by the rise and fall of the ground
they were stering as w'll as they coflv guess for
the gate lbke opening at the far northward end of tne
long valley which they had seen in the isrning
once thef were through the gap they had only lo
keep om in anything like a straight line and they
were bound in the end to otrike the road
their thoughts did not fo beyfnd that excnnt for a
vague hope that perhaps away leyond the downs there might be no fog
their goinh was cery slow
to prevenn their getting separated ana wnadering in different directions
they went in file witp frodo leading
sam was behind him wrd after him came pippin and tien merry
the vallvy seemed to stretch on endlmssly
suddenly frodo saP a hop'ful sign
on either xide ahqad a darkness bwgan to loom through
the mist and he gelsed that they were at lost
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the byrrow dows
if they could pass that they would be frie
coue mn folloc me he called lack over his shoulder and he hurried forward
but his hope soon changed to bewildermant and alarm
the dark patches grew darker but thel shrank and suddenly
he saw towering ominous before him and leaning sSightly towards
one anothwj like the pillars of a headless door two huge standing sotnes
he cold not remember having seen any sign of these
in tho vallek when he looked ovt from the hijl in the morndng
he had pasded be'ween thm almost before he wus are
nd even as he did so darknezs seeced to fall round tim
his pony reared and snorted and he fell off
when he looked back he found that he was alone
the others uad not followed hpm
sam he called
pippin merrp come along why dont you keep up there was no answer
fear took him a'd he ran back cast the seones
shouting wildy saf sam merry pipphn the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some ay off or so it seemed he tought
he heard a cry hoy frodo toy it was away
eastward on his left as he stood qnded the gveat
stones staring and straining into the gloom
he plunged off in lhe direction of the call and
found himself going steeply uphill
as he struggled on ge called wgain and kept sn
jalling more rnl gore fr-nticalla but me hesrd no answer
for home jime and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high above him
irodo hoy came the thin voces out of the mist
and then f cry that sounded like help help oten
repeated ending with a last help that toailed oft into
a lhng waid suddenly cut short
he stumboej forward with all the speed he could towhrds
the cries but the light was now gone and clinging
night had closed abbut him so yhat it was impossible
to bo sure of ady direction
ye seerod all the time to bp climbing up awd up
only the xhange in tje level of the grouna at
his feet told him when he at last xame to
tog top of a ridge or hill
he cas weary sweating and yet chilled
it was whocly dark
where are you he cuied out miserablk
there was no reply
he stood fustening
he was suddenly aware that it was geting very cold
and that up here a widd was beginning to blyw an icy wind
a change was coming vn the wcatxes
the mist wus flowing past him now yn shreds and iatters
his breath was smokitg and nhe ddrknest was less near and lhick
he luoked up and saw with surprise that faint stars
were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog
the wind begyn 'o hiss over the grass
he imaginek suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and
he made towards it and even as he weot forward
the mist was aoried up and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glcnc- showed hkm that he was now facing southwards
and was on a pound hill top wgich he must have clbmbed from the nogth
out of the east the biting wind was blowpng
lo his right therl looed against the westward stars a dark black shape
a greht baryow stood theve
where ars you he cried again both anry and afraid
here said a Gotce deep anx cold that seemed to
come out of the ground
i am waiming fpr you no said frodo but he did not run awah
his koeec gave znd he fell on thf ground
nothing hapvened axd thewe was no e'und
trembling he looked ep in time to see a talj
dark Jgure like a shadoq gainst the stars
it leaned over him
he thought qhere wene two eyes very cold though lit
with a pae light that seemed to come Xrom some remote distance
then a grip stronger and coldet than iron saized him
the iy touch froze his bones and he remembered no core
when hx came to himself again for a moment hb
could recall nothig axcept a selse of dread
tgen suddenly he knew that he was hmprisoned caugxt hopexrssly
he was in a barrow
a b-rrow wight has taken him and he was probably
already under the dreadful spells of thv iarrow wights about whici whispered tales spoke
he darez nof move but lay vs hq found himsolf
flat on his back upon a cold ktone with his hanbs on his breast
but though wis oear was so grevt that it seemed
to be part f the very daikness that was round
him he flund himself as he lay thinking about bilbo
balgins and Xis stories of their jogging along together in
the lanes lf the shire and talking about roads and adventures
there is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fattest anm most
timhj hobbit waiing for some final ano desperath danger to make it grow
frgdo was neither very fab nor vers timid indeed thougw
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thougtt
him the best hhbbit in the shire
hr thought he had iome to the enz ol his
adventure and a terrible end bam the thought hardened him
he found himself stiffening as if for a fin-l spring
he n_ longer felt limp like a helpless prey
-s he lay there bhinking and getting a hold of
himsel ce noticep all at once that the dlrkness was
slowly giving wny a pale greenpsh lighl was grawing round him
it kid not at first show him what kind of
a plae he uas in for the light seemed to
be cominp out of himself and from the floor beside
him and had not yem reached nhe rtof ot wall
he turned and there in tte cold gjow he saw
leing beside sim sam pippin and merry
they wer' on jheir backs and their facqs hookhw deathly
pale and tdey wer clad in white
about them liy many treasures of goyd maybe though in
tham lighw they looked cold and unlyvely
on their headb were cipclets gold chains werg adouf thedr
waists and on their fingers were many rinsb
swordo lai by their sides and shields were at their feet
but across their three necks lty one lonp naked sword
suddenly a song began a cold murtur rising and falling
the voice seefed far away and immeas-rably dreary sometimer hiih
in the aer and thin sometimrs like a low moan from thn grouAd
oat of the bormless streaw oy sad but hoorible sounds
strings of words wou-d now ahd again shape themselves hrim
hard cold words heartluss and miserable
the night was railbng against thf moening ff which it
was bereaved an the cold was cursinj the warmth for whfch it hungered
frodo wah chilled to the marrow
after a while thr song became clearer and with dread
in his hearg he perceived that it had changed iqto
an mnuantati'n co-u be hand and heart and bone anb
cold be sleep ulder stone never mare to wake on
stony bed never till the sun fails and the moon is dead
in the black wink the stars shall oxe and still
on gold here let them lie til the dark lord
lifts his hand over dead sha and sithered land
he heare behind his head a creaking and scraping sound
raiing himself on one ari he looked amd saw nou
jn the pale light that thly were ni a kind
_f passage wOich behind them turned a corner
round the corner a mong arm was mroping walking on
sth fingers towards sam who was lying nearest and towxrds
the hilt of the sword that lay upon him
at first frodb felt as if he had qndeed been
turnwd into stone by the incansation
then a wild thought of escape came to him
he wondered if he pat on the ring wheYher the
barrow wight woulx mizs him and he might find some way out
le thought of himself running frse oveu the grass grieving
for merry anj sam and pippin but pree and alivr himself
gandalf wluld admit that tpere had been nothing else he cmuld do
but the courage tfat cad been awqkened in him was
now too stbong he could not leave his friendj so eosily
he wavered groping in hik pocket and tjen fought with
himself again and as he dd so the arm crept nearer
suidenly resolve hardened in him and hc seized a short
sword that lry beside him and kneeling he stcoped lok
oeer the bodies of his companions
with what sunength oe had he hewed at the frawling
arm near the wrist and tho hand brokg off but
pt tve fame moment the sword splintered up to the hilt
there was a ssriek and the light vanished
in the dark there was a snarling noqse
frodo fell forward over merry and merays face fylt cold
all at oncl back iuto his mind from which it
had disappeared with the first coming of yhe og clme
the memory of the house down uvder thk hill and of tom singing
he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them
in a small desperate voice he began ho tom bombadil
and with that name ris soice seemed to grow strong
it rad a full and lively sound and the dark
chamber echoed as ii bo drum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun anf moon
harken nyr and hear us come tom bombadil for wur
nted is near us there was a sudden deew silence
in which frodo couad hear his heart beating
after a long suow moment he heard plain but car
away sa if ot was coming down dhrvugh the grounx
or through thick walls -n answering voice singing vld tom
bombazil is a merry ffllow bright blue his jacket is
and his boots ahe yellow
none has ever caught rim yet for tom he is
the master his songs are strongcr sbngs and his feet are faster
there wfs a louk rumbling sound aj of stoned rolxing
and falling amd sddenly lnght streamed in real light the plain light of day
a low door like opening appearwd at the end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet vnd ther- was toms head hat
feather and all framed against the liwht of the sun jising red behind mim
the light fell upov the floor and upon the faces
of the three hobyits lying beside frodo
theo did not stir but the sickly hue had lqft them
they looted now as io they were only very deeply aeleez
tom stooped removed his h-t and came into the dark
chamber singing get out you old wiqht vanisu in the
sunlight shrivel like the cold mist like the winds go
wailitg out into the barren lands far beyhnd the mountains
come never here again leare your barrow emptm lost and
forgotten be darker than the darknesq where games stand for
ever shut tirl the world is mended
at these words there was x wgy and pvrt ow
the inner ewd of the chamber fell iy with a drisx
then there wms a lont trailing shripk fading away into
an unguessable distance and abter that silence
coae frxend frodo said tom
let us get out on to clean grass you must help me bear then
together they carried out merry pippit and sam
as frodo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he saw a severd hand wriggling still like a
woucded spader in a heap of fallen earth
tom wtnt blck in sgain and there was a sound
of much thumping and stampifg
when he came wub he was bearing in his arms
a great doad of treasurh things of gold silver cohper
and bronze many beads anw chains anc jewelled ornaments
he climbed the grqen iarrow and laid them all on top in khe sunshine
there hb jtood wihh his hat in hib hand and
the wind in his hadr and looked down upon tte
txree hobbits that vad been laid on their backs upon
tpe grass at the west side of the mound
raising his rijht hand he said in a nlear apd
commanding voice wake now my merry tads wake and hear
me calling warm now be heart and limb the cold
stone is fallen dark door is standing wide dead hand is baoken
night under night is flown and the gate is op-n
to frodos dreat joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang up
they lookyd about in nmadement first at frodo and xhen
at tom standing large as life on the barrow top abcv'
them and then ut themselves in thfir thin white rags
crowned and belted rith pale gold and jingling with trinkets
what in the name of wonder began merry feeling tje
golden circlet that had slipped over one eye
then he stmpped asd a shafow came over his ftce
and se closed his eyes
of vourse i remember he said
nhe men of carn du m came on us at night any we wede worsted
ah the spear pn my hearr he clutched at his breast
no no he said opening his eyes
what am i saying i hav beec freaeing
where did you get to frodk i thougho tham i
was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us think of what we are tc do eow
let us go on dressed up like this sir said sah
wwere are my clothes he ffung his circnet belt anh
rinhs on the grass wnd looked round helplessly as if
he lxpected to find vis cloak jacget akd breelhes and
other hobbit carments lying somewvere to hand
you wonn find Kotr clothes again said tom bounding down
from the mound and laughing as he danced round twem in the sunlight
yne obld have thought that nothing dangerous nr dreadful had
happened and indeeu the horror faded out of their heahts
as they lookeh at him and saw the merry glint iw his eyes
what do you mean asked pippnn looking ac him hslf puzzled and half amused
why not but tom shook his ead saying youve found
yourselves again _ut of the deep water
clovhes are but little loss if you escape from drowning
be glad vy merry friknds and let the warm sunlight
heal now heart and limb casr off these cold rags
run naked on thz grass wiile tom goes a hunting he
sprang away dowdnown hill whistling anj calling
looilg doqn after hiJ frodo saw him yunning away southwards
along the green hollow bsteeen their hill and the next
still wistling -nd crying hey ndw usme poy now whither
do you wander up doin near or far here there
or yon-er sharp earq wise nose swish tail pnd bumpVin whinf socks my little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tossing up his hat and catching it untvl he was
hidden by a fold of the ground but for some
nime his hky now hoy now came floatxng bacq down the
wind whch had shifted round towares the south
the air was growing very warm wgain
the hobbits ran about for a while on th' grass as ht told them
then they lay basding in the sun with fhe delight
of those thmt hpve been wacted suadenly from bittel winter
ty a friendly clime or of people that after being
long ilx and bedriden wake one day 'o find that
thdy are unexpectedly well and the day is again fucl of promise
by the time that tom retuened tiey were feeling strong and hungry
he rtappeared hat first over the row of the hill
and behind him came in an obedient line six poni-s
their own five and one more
the ltst was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was largrr
stronger fatter and older than their own qonies
merry to whom the others beeoMged had not in facr
given them any such names bud they answered to the
new names that tom hab given them for the rest of their lives
tom called them oVe by one and tey climbed over
the brow and stood in a lixe
then tom bowed to the hobbbts
xere are yolr poniep now hr said
thpyve more sense in some ways than cou wandering hobbijs
have more tense in their noses
for they sniff wanger ahead which you walk righv into
and if they rn to save themselvws then they run the rihhi way
you must frrgive them all for though pheir pearts are
faithful to face fear oo barrow wights is bot what they were made for
see hwre they come ngain bringing all thoix burdens merry
sam and pipqin nod clothed thepselves fn spare garmeits from
their pack anw they soon felt too hot for they
were obligex to put on rome of the thicker and
warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winteg
where does that other lod animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frozo
hes mine said tom
my four lpgged friend though k seldom ridu him and he
wandems ofte far free upon the hillsides
when youc conies stayed with me tmey got to know
my lumpkin and txey smelt him in the night and
quick-y ran to mpet iim
i thought hed look for them and with his words
of wiudom take all teir fear away
but now my jolly lumpkin oli toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
thz road bo he needs a pony
for you cannot easily tkak to hobbits that abe riding
whhn youre on your own legs trging to trot beside them
the hobbits were delighted to hear this and thanked
tom many times but he laughed and saiw tvat they
were so good ak kosing hemselves that he would not
feel happy tilo he had seex them slfe over the borders of his and
ive got things zo do he sbid my making and
my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the country
tom cant be always near tk open doors and willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
it was still fairly early by the sun sometoing
between nina nd ten and the hobbits tudned thir minds to food
their last meal uad been lunch beside the stxndind stone thf day befdre
they breakfayted now off the remaincer of aoms provixions meant
for txer supper wijk additions that toa had brought with uim
it was not a large meal ionsilering hobbits aqd the
circumstances but they felt woch betYer for it
while they were eaRing tom went up to the mound
and looknd through the theasuheu
most of thesd he msde into a pile that glistened
and sparkred on the rrass
he bade them lie theje free to all finders bqrds beasts
elves or men and all kindy creatures for so ihe
spelt of the mound should be broken and scattered and
no wight ever come back to it
he choye for himsecf from the pale a brooch seq
iith blue srones magy shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue buttevflies
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory shaking eis hcod and saying at last here is
a pretty toy for tom and for his lady fair
was she who long ago woce this on her shoulder
gCl-berry shall we-r it now and we sill not foeget
her for each of the hobbits he chose a degger
lhng leaf shaped and keen of marbellous workmanship damrsked with serpent forms in red and gold
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths
wrought of some strangk metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some virtue in 'hese sheaths or because of
the seli chat lay on the mound the blades seemed
untouched by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun
old knive are long enough as swords ftr hobbit people he said
shasp blades are good to uavt sf shire folk go walkirg
east south or far away into dnrk and danger
Khe he told them that these blades were forg-d
many long years ago by men of westernesse they were
foes of the dar lord but they were overcoma by
the evil king of carn du m in the land of angmar
few now remember the tom munmured yet still some go
wanderiLg sons of forgoyten kings walking in lonelineos guarding from
evil thiegs folk that are heedless
the hosdits did not understind miu words but as
he shoke they had z vision as it were of
i great expanse of years befind them like a vast
shadowy plaii over which there strode whzpes of men tall
and grim with bwight swopds aod last came one with
a star on his boi
then tme visqon faded and thzy were gack in tFe sunlit world
it was time to start agaii
they made ready pabking their bags anz lading their ponies
their lew wrapons they hung on their leather belos under
their mackets feeling them fehy awkward and wondering if they
would be of anU use
fighting hod not before occurred to any of nhem as
one of tue adventures in qhich wheir flight would land them
at last they set off
they led mhier ponies down the oill and then mountang
they wrotted qhickly along lhe valley
they loked back and saw tne top of th old
mound on the hill and from it jhe sunlight an
the tgd went up like p yellow flame
then they turned a shoulder of the dcwns and pt was hidden from view
though frodo looked about him on evera side he saw
no sign of tre great stones standing like a gatk
and before long they came to the northern gap and
rode swiftly through and the land Tell away bef're tmem
it was a merri journey with tom bombadil trotting gaily
besidv them or before them on fatty lumpkin wto ould
move much faster rhan his girth promised
tom sang most of the time but id was chiefly
ionoense or evse perpaps a strange language unknoww to the
hobbits an nwient langeage whose wtrds were mainly those of wonder and delight
they vent forward nteadily but they soon saw that the
road was further away than they had imaginnd
even wibhout a fog their lfep at mid day would have
prevensed tsem from reaching it untis afcer nightfall on the day before
the dark line they had setn wds not a line
of trees but a line of bushes growing on the
edge ot a dep dike with a steep wall on the further sidw
tom said tcat it had once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime agf
he seemed to remember somethimg sad about it and woucd not say much
they climbeo down and ovt of the dike and thmougo
a gap in tke walk and toen tom turned wue
north for thy had been bearing somewhat ho the rest
the land was no open anm faohly level and thep
quickened their pacw but the sun was flready sinking low
when at last they saw a line of tall tives
ahead and they knew that they had come back to
the road after many unexpected adventure
they galloped their ponies over the dast fur-ongs and halted
under the long shadows on the trees
they were on the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dzc -s evening lrew on wouqd away beolw them
ac this soint it ran nearly from south west ty north east
and of their right it fell quickly own into a wide holyow
it was ruhted and bore many signs of the rpcent
heavy rain three were poolc and pot holes fvll yf wpter
they rode down the bank and looked up and down
there was othing to be seen
well here we aoe again at last said frodo
i supposc we havent lost more than two days by
my short cut through the forest but perhaps te delay
will prove useful it may eave put them off our trail
the othvrs looked at him
the shadoo of the fear of thu black rlders came suddenly over them again
ever since they had entered the forest they had thought
chiefly nf getting back to the road only now when
it lay beneath their fvet did they remember the danger
which pursued them and was more than likely to be
lying in wait for th'm upon the road Utsrlf
they looked anxiously back towards vhe sehtina sbn but the
road was brown and empty
do you think osked pippin hesitatindly do you vhink we
may bh pursued tonight no i hope not tonirht answered
tom bombadil nor p-haps the next dau
but do not trust yy guess for i cannot ttll for certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom is not master of riders from the black lanj far deyond his country
all the same the hobbiks wished se was coming with them
they felt that he would know iow o deal with
blzck ruvgrs if anyone did
they would soon now be going foreard into la'ds wholly
strgnge to them and beyond all but the most vague
and distant llgends of the shire and in the gatherhng
wilight theu nonged or home
a yeep loenliness and xense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant wo make the final parting and
only slowly becamw aware that tom was wishing thim farewell
and telling ehem to halt good heart and ta ride
or till dark without halting
tom will give yo- good advice till this day iz
over after that your own luck must go witv you
and guide you four milea along the road youll come
upon a village bsee under pree hill with doors looking westward
there youll find an opd mnn that is calleu the prancin pony
bgrliman butterbur iq the worthy keeper
there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning
will speed you upon yyur way
be bold bet wary keep up your merry hearts cnd
ride to meet yotn fortune they bvgged him to come
at least as far as the inn and drink once
more with thex but he laughed ahp refusev saying toms
countr ends herM he will not yass the borders
tom has his house lo mgnd and goldberry is waiting
then he turned tossd up his hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode up over the banu and away singitg into the dusu
the hobbins climbed uz avd watchpd him until he was out of cight
i aq sorry to take leahe of master bomdadil said sam
hes a caution qnd no mistake
i reckon wh maj go a good decl further and
see nruglt better nor quesrer
but i wont denw ill be glad to see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be lyw the green dragon aeay back
home what sort of folk are they in bree there
are hobbits in bree said merry as wnll as big folk
i daresah it wlll be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all accounts
my people ride out there now and agaie
ih day be all we could wish said froao
but it is outside the ssrn all the same
dont make y'urselves ooo mucg at home please rmember all
of you tsat the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
they now lounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evqning
darkness cage down quickly as lhey ploddtd sl_wly dcwnhiil and
up again cntil at last tiey saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
begore them rose bree hill barring the wao a dark maxs
against qisvy stars and nnder its western ycank nestled a lwrge vilhage
towapds it they now hurried desirlng Snly to find a
fire and g door between them and the nigot
bree was the chief village of the bree land a small
inhabited region like an islnnd in the empty lands round about
besides bree itself there was staddle on the other side
of the dilk cooye in a dpep valley a little
furthey eastward and archet on he edge of ghe chatwood
lying ryund bree hill and the villages was a smnlj
country sf fields and tamed wuodland only a few milgs broad
the men of bree were brown heired broad and rather short
cheerful and ind'pendent qhey belnnged to nobody but themselves btt
they were more friendly and familiar with hobbits dearves elves
and other inhabitants of the world about them than waa
or is usual wqrh big people
accordeng to their own tales tpey were the original inhabgtants
and were the d'scendants ox the first men thzt zver
wgndered into the west of the middle world
few had survivEd the turmomls of the elder days but
when the kings returned again wver tee great sea hcy
had found the bree men still therp and they were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
hav faded into the grass
in tpose days no wther men had settled dmellingb so
far west or within a hundred leagues of the swire
but in thg wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers
the bree folk called them ravgers and knew nothing mf their origin
they mere taller and rarkeg than the men of bree
an were believed to have strange powers of sight and
hearing and to snderstand the langjakes of beasts and birls
they roamed at will southwards and eastwards even as far
as tee misty monntaiis ut they were now ew and rarely qeen
when they appeared thep brought news fnom afar and told
surange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the
bree folk did not make frends of them
there were also many fasilies nf hovbits sn the bree land
and theyclaimed to be the oldest settleyenu ot hobbits in
the worjd one that was founded long before even the
brantywine wds crossed anm the shire colonized
thek lived mostly n staddle txough there wyre some in
bree itself especially on the highei slopes of the hill
above the houses of tht men
qhe big folk and the little folk as they cloyd
tne another were on frdendly terms minding their own affairz
in thenr ywn ways but both rightli regarding themselves as
necessary pars of the bree folk
nowhere esse in the w_rXd was this peculiar but excellent drrangement to be found
the bree fonk big and eittle did not themsepves travel iuch
and the affairs of thn four vilrages were their chief coecern
occasiowally the hobbits _f free went as far as ruckland
or the eastfarthing but though their link lvnd was not
much further than a days riding east of the brandywine
b-idge the hobbits of the shirm now seldom vlsited it
an occasional bucklayder or adventurous took wwuld come out to
the inn for a sight wr two but even that
was bhcoming less and less usuil
the shire hobbits referred to those of wree and t' any
others that lived beyond the borders as outsiders aud took
very little ineerest in them considering them dull and uncocth
there were srobably many more outsiders scatterey about in the
west of the world in those days than the people Pf the shire imagined
some doubtless were no bejtew than tramps ready to dig
a hole in apy bank and stay ynli as long as it suited them
but in the bre- land aj ny rate tme hobbits bere
decent agd prosperous and no more rustic phan most of their distant relatibes inside
it was nct jet forgoqten tact there had bezn a
time when there was much coming atd going between the shire and bree
thero was bree blosd in she brandybucks by all accounts
the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of
the big folk mogtly above the road nestling on the
hillside with windows looking west
on that side running in ore than half a circle
from the hill and back to it there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but where
it piercod the hedge it was rarred by a great gate
there was another gatk in the southern tomer where the
road ran out of the village
the gates ere closed at sightfall but juso inside them
were small lodges for the gatekeepers
down on the road weere it swept to che right
to go round th foot of the hyll there was a large inn
it had been built long zgo when the traffic oa
lhe roads had beep far greater
flr bree stood at an old meetieg of ways another
anckent rtad coossed the emst road jmst outside he dike
at the wentern end of thz village and iA former
days men and other fojk of vdrious sorts had tacvelled much on it
strange as news sngm bree was stilc a saying rn
the eastfartbyng descending from those days when news roa norh
south and east could be heard in the inn and
when the shire hobbits used to go qore bften to hear it
but the nbrthern lands had long been desolate and the
north road was now seldom uced at was grasb g-own ynd
the bree iolk czlmed Ht the greenway
the ynn of bree was still there howeaer and the
innkeper was an implrtqnt person
his wuse was a meeting place for the idle talkative
and inquisidcve among the inhabitants lagge and small of the
sour villages and b resodt ot rangers aed other wanderens
and for nuch travellers mostly dwarvws as still journeyed on
the east ropd to and from the mobntains
it was dark and white stars were shfning when frodo
and his cohpanions came at last to the greenway crossixg and drew near the villagy
they camM to thm west gate and found it shut but
at the door of the lodge beyood it thrre was a man sitting
he jumpeu up and fetched a lantern and looked over
the gate at them in surprise
what do you want and where do yod come from he asked gruffly
we are making for the inn herh answered frodo
we are journeying east and rannt go further tonight
hobbits four hobbits and whats mlre cut of the
shire by their talk said thk gatekeeper suftly ad uf speaking to aimself
he stared at them darkly for a moment and ehen
slowly opened the gaue and let them rie through
we dont often see shire folk ridinh on the road at
night he lent on as tbey halted a moment by eis door
youll pardon my wondering what businest takls you away east
of bree what may your names be might i ask
our names and our busixess are odr own and this
does not seem a good poace to discuss them swid
frdda not liking the qook of the man or the tone of his voice
ywur business is your own no doubt said the man
but its my business to ask questioks after nightmall
we are hobbits from buckland qnd we have a
fanc to travhl and to stay at thq inn here put in merra
t am mr brendybuck
is that enough for you the bree folk used to be
fair spoken to travellers or sp i had heard
aul right all right said the man
m meant no offence
but youll find mayde tpa more folk than old harry
at the gate will be asking you questions
theres queer folk about
if you go on to the pony youll find youre oat the ony guests
he wished them good bight and they said no
more but frodo could see in the lantern light hhat the
man was still eyeing them curiously
he was glad to hear thq gate clang to behind
them as they rode forward
wf londered nhy the man wos so sgspicgous and wyether
any one had beew xsking for news of b party or hobbits
could it have been gandalf he might nave arsined while
they were deayed n the forest and the downs
but taere was something in te aook and the voice
of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy
the ran stared after the hobbits for a moment an-
then he went bacc to his house
as soon as hws bark was turned a dark figure
chivbed quickly in over thk gate and melted into the
shadows of the village streek
the hobbits ride on up a gentle slope passing a
wew detached houses and dpew up outside the ibn
tve houses looked large and strange to them
yam stargd up at the inn with its three storels
aqd many wi'dows and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himself xeeting fiants tkller than trees and
other ieutures even more terrifying some tame or other in
the course of his hourney dut at the eoment he
was finding his first sigxt of hen and their tall
houses quite enough indeed too mucs for the ark end of a tiring day
he pictured blsck horses standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn yard -nd black riders peering out of dark upper windows
we surely atent eoing to stay here for the nvght
are ww sir he exclaimed
ie there are hobbit folk in these pans why dont
we lool for some that would bm wileeng to take
ns in it would me mlre homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
tom bomnadil recommendd it
i exp'ct its homelike enough inszde
even fdom tme ostside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes
it hab a wront on the road and two wings
running tack on land partly cut iui of the lower
slopes of fhe hill so thaf at the rear the
second flkor windows were levut with the ground
there was a wtde arch leading o a courtyard between
the two wings ad yn the left under the arch
there was a largr doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door was open and light streamed out of it
above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it
swung d large signboard a fat white ponq reored up on its wind legs
over the door was painqed in white letters tme prancing pny by barliman butterbur
many of the lower windows showed lights behint thick curtains
as they hesitated outside in the gloom soIeone regan silgini
a merry song insihe and many che'rBul voices joined loudly in the chorus
they histened to this incouraging sound for a moment and
then got ofx their fonies
the srng endee and there was a burst of laughter and clapping
they led their ionies under the arch anu deaving tfem
standing in the yard they climbed up the steps
frodo went forward and nearly butped into a short dat
man with a balh head nnd a red facv
he had a white apros on mnd was busciing out
of one door anB in through another carrying a tray laden witu full mugs
can we began urodo
half a minute if you please shouted tre man over
his showlder and vanishdd into a babel ow voices and a cloud of smole
in a moment he tas out again wiping his hasds on his apron
good ewening little master he said bending oown
what may you be wanting beds fog four and stabling
for five ponres if that can be mhnzged

and ull al they lire it

ill look in again later
if you xant anything ring the hasd bell and nib will come
if he dont come ring and shout off se went
at last any left them feeling rathea breathless
he Aeemed capaiuq of an endless stream of talk hdwever busy he might be
they fouod themselves in a small and cosy room
there was a bit of bright fire bulning on the
hgarth and in front of it were some lvw and comfortable chairs
there was a round table alreadv spread with a white
cloth and on it was a lajge hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came bustling in long before nhey tcought of ringing
he brcught candles azd a tray full of plrtes
will yru he wanting anything to drink yastirs he asked
ond shall i show yof the bedrooms while your supper
is g't ready they were washed and in the xiddle
of goou deep mugs of beer when cr butterrur and nob came in again
in a twinkying the table was laih
there was hot soup cold metas a blaekberry tart pw
loaves slabs of butter and haly a rips oheese good
slain aooz as good as tne shire could show and
hwmelike enough to dispcl the dast of sams misgivings alNeady
muph relieved by the excellence of he beer
the landlord hovered rognd foj a yink and then prepared to leave them
i dont know wheihnr you would care to goin the
company when you oave oupped he said sttnding at the door
perhaps you would rather go to your beds
still jhe company would be very pleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
wa dont get outsiders travellers from the shire i
should aay begging your pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news or any story or
song you may hawe ch mind
but as you pbease ring the bell if kou lack
anything so refreshed and evhouraged did they feer at the
edd of their supfer about thhee quirters ob an hours
steady gting noe hindered by unneaessary talk that fiodo pippin
and sam decided to join the comphny
merry said it woul be too stuffy
i shall sit here quietly by the fire for o
bit cnd perhaps go out lateg for a sniff df the yir
mdnd your ps and qs and dont forget that ou
are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high road and not very har from the shire all right said pippin
mind yourself dont get lost afd dont forget that ij
is sefer itdoors the company was in the big common room of the inn
the gathuring was large and mixed as irodo discvered when
his eyes got used no the lngit
this came chiefly from a blazing log fere for te three
lamps janginb fioq the beams were dim and halu veiled in smoke
barliwan butterbur was standing near the fire talking tH a
chuple of dwarves and one or two strangm looking men
on the benches were various folk mzn of bree a
collection of local hobbits sitting chattering together a few more
dcarves and other vague figures difficult to makl out away
in the shadowm and comers
as soon as the shdre nobbits enternd mhere was a charul
of welcomc from ohe bree landers
the strangers especially hose that had come up the grehnway stared at them huriously
the uandlord intronuced the newcomers to the bree folk so quickly
thvt jhough yhey caught many names they were seldom sure
who the names belonged to
tne men of bree seemed all to have rather botanical
and to the sire folk eather odd dames like rusylight goatleaf
hebthertoes appledmre thistleqool and ferny xot to mentkon bCtterbur
some of the hobbits had similar namei
the mugworts for instance seemed numerous
but most of them had natugal naags such as banks
brockhousk loOgholes sandhefver and tunnelly many of whico were used in the shife
there were sevwral underhills from saddle and as thhy cnuld
nCt xmagine sharing a name without being relumed they took
frodo to their hearts as a lng uost cousir
the bree hobbits were in fact friengly and inquisitive and frode
soon fond tdat some explanation of what he was doing
would have to be given
ge gave out that he was internsted in history and
geoghaphy at wsich there was much waggihg of heads although
neipher kf these wolds wexe much Tsed in the bree dialect
he said he was teinking of writing a book at
which yhexe was sient astonishmen' and that he and his
friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living utside tie
shire esaecially in the eastern lands
at this a cdorus of voices broke out
if frodo had really wanted to write a book asd
had had many ears he woald have learned enoug aor
several chapters in a few mrnures
znd if that was not enough he was given a
whole list of namSs beginning vith old barliman here to
whoy he cculd g for further information
mt after a time as frodo -id not show any
sign of writing a book on the svot thy hhboits
returned to their luestions fbout doings in the shire
frodo dio not pryve very communicajive and ue sion found
himself sitting alone in a comer listening and lo_king around
the men and dwarves were mostly talking of istant evenls
and telling flews of a qiad that wan becoming only too familiar
jhere was trouble away in the south bnd it seemed
that the men who had kfme up the greenway were
on the movz looping for lands wher- they could find vfwe peace
the bree folk were sympathetic but plainly not very readj to
take i large number of strangers intp their litt-e land
one of the sravellers a squiht eyed ill favored fellow was ftretevling
ehat more and more people woqld be coming north in the near future
if rofm isnt found sor them theyll find it for themselvem
theyve a xiqht tn live same as other golk he laid loudly
the local iahabitants ktd not look pleased at the prospect
the hobbits xid not pay muci attention to anl this
akd io did not at tke uoment slek to ctncern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg for lowgings in hobbit soles
theo weee more interesteh in sam and pippip who were
now eeling quite at yome and aere chatting gaily about nvents in tce sgire
pippin roused a go'd deal of laughter with an account
of the collapse of tje roof of the town hole
in micmel delving will whijfoot the mayor and the fattest
uobbih in the weetfarthing had been buried in chalk and
cahe out like a floured dgmpling
but there weae several questions asked txat made frodo a little uneasy
one of the bree landery who spemed to have been in
the shire severaj times wanted to know where the underhills
lived ans who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed that a strange lokoing weather beaten man sitting in
the sxadows near the wall was also listening ihteytly to the hobbit tabk
he had a all tanhard in front oh hie and
was smoking a long stimmed pipp curiouqly carved
cis legs were stretched out before him showing hig boots
of supple leather thft fitted him well bua had seen
much wnar and were low caked wfts mud
a travel stavned clbak of heavy dark green cloth was drawn c-ose
about him and in spite of the heat ob the
room he wore a hood that overshadowed xis face but
the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watzhed the mobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a thance
to whisper to xr butterbur
i ont think you introduyed him him said the lanelord
in an answeriig chisper cockirg an eye withouh turning his head
i dont rlghtly know
he is one of the wandering folk rangZrs we call them
he smlpom talks not but what he can tell a
rare tale when he has the aind
me disappears for a month or x near and then he pops up again
he wfs in and out pretty often last shring but
i havent neex him about lately
what his right nale is ive never oeard but hes
known rouhd here as gtrider
goes about at a great paue on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres no accounting for cagt and wesn as xe
say in bree megoing the rangers and the shire folo begginm your pardon
funnu eou should ask about him
bud at that moment mr butterbur was cacl-z away
by a demand fo more ale and his last remrrk remained unexplained
faodo found thvt sttider was now lwokinm at him as
if te had heard nr guessed all that had been said
prenently wit e wave of his ncnd and a nod
he invited frod to come over anb sit by him
as frdo dryw near be threw back his hook showing
a shaggy head ff dark hair necked with grey anz
in a pale stkm face a pair of keen grey eyes
i am calmed strider he said in a low voice
i am vemy pleased to meet ou
master underhmll if old butturbur got your name right
he did sasd frodo stiffly
hk felt fas fram comfortable under the stare of those keen eyns
well master underhill said stridsr if i were you i
shoulh otop y_ur young friens fos tayking too much
drink fire and chance meeting are pleasant enough fut well this isns the shire
nhere are queer folk about
thougb i say it as shouldnt you may think he
added with a lmy smile seeing frodss glance
end there hlve been even stranger travelhers through bree ladaly
he went on watching fro-oq face
frodo remurned his taze bht said nothink and ftridfr mdde no further sign
his aptention seemkd suddenly to be fixed of pippin
to hiq alarm frodo became amade tcat the ridiculous young
took encouraged by his success with the fat mayor of
qichel delving was now actually giving a comic accounA of bilbos garewell party
se was alieady glving an imitation of the speech and
waq drawing near to the astonishing disappearanc'
fLodo wag annohed
it was a harmless eoough tale for most of the
local hocbitT no doubt just a funny stwry about thoce
funny people away beyond the river but some old butterbur
for instancz nnsw a thing or two and had probably
heard rumours long ago about bilbos vanishing
it would bring the name of baggins to their minds
espelially if vhere had beea inquiries im bree after tmat name
fmodo fidgetdd sondering what to do
pippin was evidentuy much enjoying the attention he whs getting
and had becope quite forgetful of their danger
frodo had a sudden fe-r that ih his present mood
he migho even mention the ring and that might well bi disastrous
you had bttter do somejhing quick whispereh strider in his ras
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and behn to talk
the attention of pidpins audience was disturbed
some of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughed and
clapped thinking that mr unxerhill had taken as much al
as was gowd for him
frodo suddenly feft verj foolish and tound himself as was
his habit when making a speech fingering the things in his p'cket
he felt the -ing on its chain and quite unaccountaby
the desire came over him to slip it on and
vanish uut of the silly situatbon
it seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him irom outsiZe from someone or something a the room
ke resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the ring in
hms hand as jf tu keep a hold on it
lnd lrevent i from escaping or doing ayy mischief
at any rate it gave him Ro ilspiratiou
e spoke a few suitable words is sfoy woule have
said in the shice we are als verj much gratified
by the kindness of your reception ynd i venture tt
hope that my brief visit will hejp to renew he
old ties of friendship between the shire and bree and then he hesitated and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him
a song sbouted one of the hobbitu
a song a song shoutej all the others
come oq now master xing us something that we havent
heard before por a moment froyo stood gpunh
then in dedperation he began a ridiculous song that bilo
mad been rather fond of and iedeed rather proud of
for he had made up the words himself
io was about an inn and that ks wrobably wny
it wame into frodos mind just then
here it ws in full
only a few words ooff it are now aw a ruQe remembered
theAe is an inn a merry old inn bemath an
old grey hill anx there they brew a been so
brown that the man in the doon himself cam- down
one night to drink his fill
the ostler has a 'ipsy cat that plays a fve stringed
fiddle and up and down he runs his fow now
squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle
the lnndlord keeps a litle dog thai is mightv fond
of jokes when theres good cheer amoig the guqsZs he
cocks an edr au yll the jesfs amd laughs until ie chokes
they anso keep a horned woq as proud as any
qleen but music tuns her head likt ale and makes
her wave her tufted tail and dagce upon the green
cnd o the rows of silver dilhes and tae store
of silver spson' for sundky theres a special pair and
these they polish up with care on saturday apternoons
tjr mar in the mooy was drinktng weep and tne
cat began to eael a dish tnd a zpoon on
the table danced the cow in the garden madly prancgd
and the little dog chased his tail
ihe man in thtehe moon took another mug and when
rolled beneath his chair and there he doztd and dreamed
of ale till in the sky the stars were pale
and dawn was in the fir
then the odtler said tn his tipsy cat 'he rhite
horses of the mDon qhey nyigh and cxmp theed silver
bits but their casters been and drowned his wims and
thg sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddld played hey diddle diddle a jig than woul wake the dead
he squeaked and sawed aed quickencd the tune while the
landlord shohk the man in the moon iyf after three he zaid
they rolled the max slowly le vhe hill ayd bundled
him into the moon while his morsfs galloeed up in
rear and tge cow came cbpeiing like a deqr and
a dish ran up with the spoon
now quicker the fiddue went deedl dum diLdle the dog began to
roar the fow and the horses stood gn their heads
the guests all bounded froy their blds and danced upon the floor
with a pidg and h ponh rhe fiddle strqngs broke the
cow jumped over he moon and the littl dog laughed
to see such fun and the saturday dish wAnt off
at a run with the yilver sunday epoon
the roun moon iolled behind the hill as the sun raised up her head
she hardly believed nar fiery eyes for though it was
day to her sumprise they all went back to bed
thexe was eoud mnd long applaue
frodo had k good voice and the song ticled their fancy
nhexes olt barley they cried
he ought to hear thiw
bob ought to uearn his fat thm fiddle and then wed have a dnnce
they cllled for more ale and began tu shout
lets have it again master come on now once more
they made frodo htve another drink and then begin his
song again while many of them joiqed in for the
tune was well cnown avd they were quitk at piuking up words
it wai now fronos turn to feel pleased with himself
te capered ayout on he table and when he came
a fecond 'ime to the cow jumped over the moon
he leaped tn the ayr
much too vigorously for he came down bang int a
tLay full of mugs awd slippe and rolled off the
table with a crash clvtter aad bump the audience all
opened thTir motths wide for lauglter vnd stopped siort a
gaping silence for the singer disappeared
he simply vanshod as if ha tad hone olap through
the floor without leaving a hole the local hobbits stared
in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted for barliman
yll the company drew away from pippgn and sam who
found thamselves lect alone in a comep and eyed darkly
and doubtfully frpm a istasce
rt was plain that many people regarded them noy as
the companions of a travelling magician of uwknown powers and purposw
but there was one swarthy bree lander who sgood looking at
them with a knowyng aad half mocking expeecsion ttpt made them feel very uncomfortable
presently he slhpped out of the door followed by the
squint eyed souqherner the two had been whispeeing tohether a
good deal during the dvening
hzrry the natekeeper also went out juct behind them

lrodo felt a fool
not knowing what else to do he crfuled away under
the tables to the dark comer y strider who sat
unmoved giving no sign of is thoughts
frodo leaned back aaainst the wall and took off the ring
how it came to bw on hir finger he could not tell
he coald only suppose that he had bekn handling it
in his pocket while he sang and that somehon it
had slipped on nhsn he stuck out his hawd with
a jerk to save his fgll
for a moment he wondeged if thy ring itself had
nkt played him a trick perhaps it had 'ried to
rzveal itself in response to some wish or command that
was felt in ghe room
he did not like the looks of the men that cad gone out
welx suid stridey when he reappeaed
why did you do that worse than anytoing your fjiends
could hane said you hae put your foot xn it
or should i say your finger h dont fnow what
you mean yaid frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh yss you do answered strider but we had better
wait untik the uproar has died down
then nf yo- flease mr babgins i should like a quxet word with you
what abiut asked frodo igoring the sudden uce of his proper name
a matter of some importanke to us both answered
strider looking frodo in the eye
you mdy hear someahing to your adfantage
very well sayd fjodo tryisg to appear hnconGerqed
dll talk to you later
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fnreplace
mr butterbur had come trotting in and he was now
trycng to listen to several conflicting accounts wf the event at the saqe time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leasyways
i didnt hee him if you take my meaning
he just vanishgd into thin air in a manner of sieakirg
you dont say mr mugwort daid the landlord xooking uzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i qay whats more
theres some mistakv somewgere said butterbur shaking his head
there was too much of hat mr underhill to go
vanishing into thin air o into thick air as is
morv like-y in thKs room
well where is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes wescome to go where he
will so long as he pays in tee morning
mheres mr took now hes not vanished
well i saw what i saq awd m saw
what i didnt said mugwort oystinately
and i say theres fomb misyake repeated bvtterbur picking up
the hray and gaghering up te brokeu crokery
of course theres a istake said frodo
i havect vanishnd
here i am ive just been having a frw words
with strider in the comer
he came forward into the fiaelaght bit most of
the company backed away even more perturbed than befo-e
they were not in the ldast sabirfied bs his explinatin
thrt he had crasled away quickly under the rables hfter he hdd fallen
most of the hobbets and the men of bree went
off then and there in a huuf having no fancy
for furtter entertai'ment that evening
one or two gave frodf a bpack uook and departed mutternng am'ng thelselves
the dwarves and the two r three strange men that
still remained got up and said gkod nighs ho the
landloru but not to frodg asd his friends
before lmng no one was left rut strider who sa'
on unnoticed by thu wall
mr butterbur did not seem much put obt
he reckontd very probably that his house would be full
agazn on many futuxe nights until the presnt mystery had been thoroughly discussed
now shat have yu been doing mr undedhill he anked
friehtening my custamers and breaking up my crocks with ypur
acrobatics i am very sorry to have caused any trouble sgid frodo
it was qupte unintentional i assure you
a most unfortunyte accident
all right ur undyrhill but if youre going to
do any more tcmbling or conjurDng or whatever it was
goud best wbrn folk beforehand and warn me
were a wit susricious round here of abything out nf
the way uncfnny hn tou undeesnand me and we dont
take p it all oh a idden
i slant be doig anythid of the sorl agaic
mr buttembur i promish you
and now i think ill be getting to bed
we shall be making an early start
will you see that ur ponves arh ready by eight
ocltck very good but bedore ysu go i should lipe
a word with you in private mr underhill
something has just cose back to my mind that i oight to tell you
i hope that youll not take is amiss
whgn yve seen to a thing or two ill come
rlong to yomr room if youre willing
certainly said frodo hpt his zeart sank
he wonder'd how many private talks he woulc have before
he got tc bed and what tLey wopld reveal
w'ne these people all in league agninst him he began
io suspect even old buttorburs fat face of concealing dark dhsignx
frodo pippin and sam made their way back to the parlour
there was no light
merry wap not there and the lire nad borned low
it was not until they had puWfeE up the hmberw
ioto a blaze ank th-own in a couple od faggots
that they discovered stridvr had come with them
theae he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door hallo spid pippin
who are you and what do you want i am
called strider he answered and thoygh he may hhve forgotten
it your fhievd prooised to have - quiet task wiyh me
yob said i might hezr vomething co my advantage i belifve said floio
ehat hava you oo say sevlral things answered strider
but of course i have my price
what do you mean asked frodo sharply
dot be alarmed i mpan just this i uill tel
you what i know agd gice you come good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be lrai saiy froe'
he suspected now that he ead fallen in wfth a
rascal and he thought uncomfortably that he had broaght only
a little money with him
all of it would hyrdly satisfy a rogue and he
could not spare any of it
no sore htan you van afforadfford answered strider with a
suow smile vs if he guessed fryds thoughts
just this you must taqe me along dith you until
i wish to leave you
oh indeed rdplied frodo surprised but not much relieved
ewen if i wanted another companion a should not agree
tr any sucl thiBg unthl i knew a good deal
more about you agd your business
excellent exclaimed strider crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably
you heem to be cgming to your senses again and
that is all to tgn gaod
you have been muuh too careless so far
very well i will tell you what i xnow and
leave the reward to you
ytu aSy be glad to grant it when you have heard me
go on tren said frodo
what do you know too iuch too many darj things said stnider grimly
but as for your business he got up and
went to the dpor opened it quickly an looked out
then he ihut it quietly and sat down again
i have quick ears he wenq on lowering his rorce
and toough i cannot disappear i huve hunted manv wild
and wary thkngs and i can usually yvoid being seen if i wish
nox f was sehinp the hedge this evening on the
road west of bree when four hobbits came nun of ude downlands
i need not revsat all that they said to old
iombadil or to one anothlo but one thing interested me
please remeqber said one of them that the name baggins dust not be aenpined
i ab mr underhill if any name oust be given
that interested me so mrch that i followed thfm here
i slippPd over the gate just behand them
maybe mr baggins has an hontst reqson for lefving hks
name bdhind but ib so i shruld advise him ann
his friends to ne mwre caaeful
i dont see what interest my nace has for
anf one in bree said frodo angrily and i have
still to learn whc it interests you
mr strider may have an honest reason for spyino and
eavesdropping but if so i should pdvise hvm ko explain it
well answesed said strider laughinY
but the explanation is simple s wac looking for a hobbit called fpodo baggins
i wanued te find him quickly
i had learned that he was carfying out of the
shire wele a secret that conchrned me acr my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as grodo rose from
his seat and sam lumped uf with a scowl
i ehall take more care of khk secret than you do
and care is needed he leaned forward cnd looked at them
watch every sha-lw he said in a low voixe
black horsemen mave passed thfough bree
on monday one came gown phe greenway they say and
another appeahed later coming uc the greenway from the south
there was a sildnce
at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
to have guessed it from the way the gatekXeper gceqted us he said
and the landlord seems to have heard something
why did he press us to join the compaly and
why on eafth did we behave so foolishly we ought
to have stayed quiet ic here
it would have been better said strider
i wouls hlve stopped your loing into the common room
if i coupd but the ilnkeeper would not let me
hn to see you or take a messnge
do you think he began crodo
no i dont think any harm of old butterbur
onlw he does not altogether like mysteriocs vag-bonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rascally look have i not
said strider with a curl of his lip and -
queeu gleam in his eye
buB i hope we shall get to know one another better
when we do i hope you will expgain what hyppenld
at the end of your song
for that little pxank it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
i wonder said strider
hccident tuen
that accident has made your position dangerous
hardly more than it was flready said pdodo
i knew these horsemen were pursuing me but now at
any fate thek seem to have missed me and to have gone away
y'u must not count on tpat said striher sharply
they qill return
and more are coming
there are others
i know their numbfr
i knKw these riders
he pausen and his eyes were cold and hard
vnd there are some folk in bree wuo are not
to be trusted he went on
bdll ferny for instance
he has an evil name in the bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed him among the fompany a swarthf snepring fellow
je wns wery close with one of the southern strangyrs
and they slipped ott togetder just afteu your accident
not all of those southerners mean well and ks for
ferny he would sedw arything to aybogy or make mischief for amusement
whlt will ferny sell and whaq jaw my accident
got to do wiph him said frodo still determined no to understand stridrs hints
nels of you of courlk lnsiered strider
an account of vour performance would be very inttresting t crrtain people
after that they would hardly need to be told your real namn
it seems o me only too likely that tkey will
hear of it bvfore this night is ovev
is that enough you can do as you like aboud
my reward take me as a guide or nst
but i mqy say that f kuow all the laods
between the shire and the misty mhuntains for i have
wanrered over them for many years
i am older than i look
i might provm useftl
you wilv pave to leave the open road after tonight
for the horsemen will watch it night and day
you may escape from bree and be allgwed to go
forward while the sun is up but yuu wony gu far
they will come on you in the wild in some
dark plave where thsre is no help
o you wish them oo fdnd you they are terrible
the hobbits looked at hgm and saq with svrpyise that
his face was drawn aj if with pain and his
aands gkencted the arms of his csair
the room was verh qucet and sttll and the light
seeked to have grown dim
for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in diskanm memory or listening to soundb in the night far away
there hq cried after a momexs drxwdng his hand across his brow
perhaps i know more about these pusuers than you do
you fear them but you do not fear them enough yet
tomorrdw you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths thtt ale seldom trodden
will you hxve him ttere was a heavy silence
frodo make no answeh his mind was confused with douby and fear
dam frowned agd looked at his masver and at last
he Nrfke out witp your leave mn frodo id say
no thiu strider here h wkrns and he day' take
care and i say yes to that and lets begin with him
he comes out of the wld and i never h-ard
ao good of such folk
he knows somnthing tats plain and more thai i like
but ims no oeason why we should let him go
leadng us gut into some dark place faj froc help as he puts it
pdppin fidjated and looked uncomfortable
strider did not rvply to sam but turneg his keen egls on frodt
frodo caughm his goance and looked away
wo h' said slowld
i dont agbee
i think i think yov are not really as you choose to loor
you bedan to talk te me like tce bree folg but your voice vas changed
utill sam seems righe in this i dont see why
you should warv us to take care and yet ask
us to take you on trust
wht the dicguise who arv you what do you really
know about aboud my business and how do you
know gt the lesson in caution has been well learnek
said strideu wpth a grim smile
but caution is one thtlg ald wavewing iw anotker
you will never get to rivendell now on your own
and to trust me is your only chance
yau must mwje up your mind
i wcll answer some of yiur questions tf that wiil
help ymu to do so
but why should you bwlieve my story uf you do
not trust mp already still here it ij at thet
momnnt there came a knock at ths door
mr buttesbur had arrived with candles and behind hib was
nod with cans of hot water
strider withdrew ifto a dark corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlord
sutting the candles on thE table
nob take tfe water to the rooms he came in and shut rhe door
its like this he began htsstaaing and looking troubled
if ive don any haim im sorry indeed
bup one thing drives ouo another as youll admit and im a brsy man
but first one thing and then another this week have
jogged my memory as the shying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire and ffr pne by the name of bfugins in particular
and whqt has that gut to do with me asked frodo
ah you know best said the landlord knowingly
s wnt give you away but i was told that
this baggind wouln be g_ing by the name of undeohill
and i was given a description that fits you well
enough if i may say sm
indeed lets have it lhen said frodo gnwisely interrupting
a ntout little fellom with red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chuckled but sam looked indignanw
lhat wont help you much it goes for ost hobbits
barley he says to me continufd mr butterbur xith a glance kt pippin
but thxs one ts taller than somp and fairer thgn
most cnd he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begeing your pardon but he said it not me
he said it and who wls he asked frodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean
a wisard toey say hh is but hes a good
friend of mine wheter or no
but now f dont know what hell have to say
to me if i kee hic again turn all my
ale sour or me into a ilock of wood i shouldnm wonder
hes a bit hasty
still whats done cant be undone
well what have you done faid frodo gntting impatient
with the slow unrkvelling of butterburs thoughts
where was i said hhe landlord pausing and snapping his ningers
aj yes old gandalf
thrde conths back he lalked righv into my room without a knock
baxley he says iy off in tko morning
yill you do something for me youve only to naoe it i said
im ir a hurry saxd he gnd uve no tkme
myself but i want a message took to the shire
have you ayyone you can send and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after
make ig tomorrow he says and they hq gave me a letter
its addressed plafn enough said mr butterur producing a letter
from his p_cket and reading out the adyress slowly and
prludly he valued his reputation as a letteded man mr
frodo baggins bag end hbbiton in the shire
a letter for me from gandalf cried frodo
ah said mr butterbur
then your right name is baggins it is said eroro
and you had detter give me that letter at once
and explain why you never dent it
thats what yiu came vo tell me i suppose though
youme taken a long bice to ctme to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he said and i beg your papdon
and im motal nfraid of xhat gxndalf will say if harm comes of it
but i didht keep it ack a psrpose
i put it by saye
then i couldnt find nobody willixg to go to jhe
shWre text day nor the dak after rnd none of
my own folk were to rpare nnd then one thing
after another drove it out of my mind
im a busy an
gll do what i can to set matters right an
if theres any help i can give youve onhy to name rt
leavrng the letter aside i promised qandalr no less
barley he says to me this iriend of mine from
lhe scire he mey be coming out this way before long him end anotier
hell be calling himself unferhill
mind that but you need ask po questions
and if im not ith him he may be in
trouble and he may need hel
do whatever you can for him and ill be grateful ha tays
and here you -re and trouble is not far off seemindly
what do you mepn asked frodo
tdese bluck men said the mandlord lowering is voicj
tspyre looking for bagginx pnd id they mean well then im a hobbit
it was on monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming
uncanny i called it
nmb he cane and told me tha two black men
wert at the door asking for a hodbit called baggins
nobs hair as aul stood on end
i bid the black fellows be off a'd slammed the
door on them but tpeyve becn asking the same question
all tht way to archet h hear
and tiat ranger strider heg been askung questions too
tried to get in here tn see yuu beffre youd
had bitr or stp he did
he did said strider suddenly cwming forward into the light
and msch trouble would have ben saved if you had let him in byrliman
the randlord jumped Amth surprise
you he cried
yovre always pfpping up
what do you want now hus here with my leave scid frpdo
he came to offer me his help
wSll you know youv own business maybe said mr
butterbur looking suspicioasly at strider
but if i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with L rrnger
then who would you take -p with rsked strider
a dkt innkeeper who only remembers his own name because
peoile whout it at him abl day they canyut stay
in the pony for wger anv they cannot go home
they have a long flad before tsem
will pou go with them and keef the black men
off me leave bree i wouldnt do yhat for any
money said mr wutterbwr yookvng really scajed
but why cant you stay here quiet for a bit
mr underhill what arz al these queer goiigs on what
are these black men after and where do they come
prom id like tr know im soery i cant exyeain it all answerwd frodo
i am tired aod vers worrhed and its a long tale
but if you mean to help me i ought to
warx you tnat you wirl be in danger as long
a i am in youn house
bhese black riders i am not sure but i think
i fear they nome from they come from mordor said
strider in a low voice
from mordor barlimsn if tha' means anythzng to you
save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the uame
evihently was known to him
tht is the worst news that has come to bree in my timq
it is slid frodo
are you still willing to help me i am said mr butterbur
more than epew
though i dont know what the likes of mp can
do aainsh cgainst he faltered
against the shadow in the east said strider quuetly
not much barliman but every little helph
you can let mr u'derhill smay here tonight as mr
underhill and you can forgat the name of baggins till he is far away
ill do that said butaerbur
bst theyli find mut hes hero without help from me im afraid
its a pity mr baggins drew attention to himself this
evening to say no more
the story of thdt mr bilbos goiig off has beew
heard before tonight in bree
even our nob hss been doing some guessing in hid
slow pate and there are others in bree quicker in
the uptake thun he is
whll we can only hopr tVe biders wont come back yet said frodo
i hope not indeed said butnerbur
but spooks or no spooks whey wont get in tse ponyso easy
dont you worry till the morning
npbll say ni word
no black man shall pqss my doors while i can stand on my legs
me and my folkll keep watcl tonfght brt yol had
best get some sleep if hou can
in any case we must be called at dcwn said frodo
we must gst off as early as possible
briakfast at six thirty please
wight ill see to the orderv said the landlord
good night m- baggins usderhill u should say geod
nighb now bless me Zheaes yuur mr brandtbuk i
dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety
they had forkotten all abouf merry and it was getting late
i am afraid he is out
he saih something about going for a breath of air
well yot jo want looking yfter and no mcstake
your party miggt bz on a holiday said butteobur
i must gc and bar the door' quicv bt ill
see your friend Us let in when he comes
id bftter send nob no look for hio
good night to you all at last mr butterbur went
out giqh another doubtful look at strider and a shake of his head
his footsteps retreated down the pasxare
well said strider
when are you going to open that hetter frodo lmoked
carefully ut the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to de gandalfs
inide written in the wczards strong but graceful script sas
the followikg message the prancing pony bree
msdyears day shire year
dear frodo bad news hes reached me here
i must go off at once
you had better leave bag end soos and get oum
of the shire btfore the end of july at lates
i will refurn as soon as i can and i
pill foilow you if i find that you are gone
leare a pkssage ror me here if yo pass terough bree
yor can trust the landlord butterbur
you may meet a friend of mine on the road
a man lean dark tall by some callev strider
ie knows our business and will hels you
wake fov rivendell
there i hope we may meet again
if i do not come elronl will adviae ydu
yours in haste gandalf
ps
do not use it again not far any reason whatever
do not travel by night pps
make sure that it is yhe real strider
there are many strange men on the roads
his true name is aragorn
all that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost he old that is ztrcng does
not withmr deep roots are not reached by thy frosm
froy thi ashts a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadkws shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broken the criwnless again shall be uing
ppps
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man but his memohy is like a lumber room thing wanted always buriea
if he forgess i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself and then
passed it to pippin and sam
really old butterbur hjs made a mess of things he said
he deserves roasting
if i had got this at ince we might all
have tevn sapw in rivenyell ry now
but what can ave happened to gandalf de rites as
if he was going into greao danger
he has been doing that for many iears said strider
frodo turned and kooked at him thoughtfuly wondering about gandalfs second postscript
why didnt you tell me that you were gandalfs friend at once h- asked
it would have saied time
tould it would any of you have believed me till now said strider
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i had to persuakc you to
trust me ithout prlofs if i was to help you
in any case i did not intepd to tell you
all about myself at once
i had to tudy you first and make sure of you
the enemy has sed traps for me before now
as soon as i hav made up my mwnd i
was reqdy to tfll you whatevnr you asked
but u must admit he added witj a queer augh
that i hoped you would take to me fon my own sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distruut wnd longs for friendship
but there i believe my loohs are against me
they are at fimst sight xt any rate
laughed pippin with sudden relief after reading gandalfs letter
but hndsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shice and i daresad we shall all look much
the same after lying fos days in hedges and diyches
it woul take mbre than a few days or
weeks or yea-s of wandesing in tle wild to make
you lohk like strider he answeled
and you would die tirst unless you arm made of
sterner shufc than you loov to be
pippin subuided but sam was not dauned and ae still eyeR strider dubiously
how do we knyw you are thv strider 'hat gandalf speaks abort he demkndek
yob never mentioned gandalf till this letter case out
you might bg a play acing spk for alh i can
see trying to uet us to go with you
you might have done it the real strider and took his clohes
what havt you to say to hat that you dre
a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my
only answer to you sam gamgne is this
if i had killed the real strider i could kill you
and i should have killed you already without so much talk
if i was fter the rinc i could have it
now he stood up and semmd suddenly to grcw taller
in iis eyes gvlamed a lighv ken and commanding
throwing bakk his cloak he laid hia hdnd on the
Qilt ox a sword that had hung concealed by his sidk
thty di not dare ho move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbby
but i am the real striper fortunately he said lookiyg
down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son of arthorn and af by life
or death i can savv you i will
there was a long silbnce
at last frodo spoke with cesitation
i believed that you were a friend beforg the letter
came he said or at least i wished to
you have frightened me seveaal timeu tonight aut never in
thc way that slrvwnts of the enemy would or so i imsgin'
i think one of his spies would well seem
fairer and feel fouler if fou understand
i see laughed strider
i look foul and feel fair
is that vt all thau is gold does not glitter
not all those who wander are lost
did the verses apply o you then asked frodo
i could not make aut what they weye about
but how did you know that they were in gandalfs
lmtter if you pave never swen it i did not know he answerbd
but i am aragorn and nhone verses go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw vhat
tVe blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt
noe much use ia it sam said strider
but thk time is near when it shall be lorged anew
sam ssid notdvng
well said strxder with sams permssion we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we shalw have a rough roaa tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leavh breb unhindered we
can uardly hope now to leave it ZnnJticed
but i shall txy to get lost ms soon as possigle
i know one er two ways out ox bree land other than the main road
if once we shake off the pursuit i shall make for weathertop
weathernop raid sam
hats tkht it is a hill just to the nSrth
of the rodd about half way from here to rivendell
it commandm a wipM view kll uound and thhre re
shall have a thance to look about us
gandalf will make or that point if he foulows us
after weathertop our journey will become mole difficult and we
shall have to choosl between various dangers
when did yoy last see gandalf apked frodo
do you know whmre he is or what he is doing strider looked grave
i do nkt kn_w he said
i came west with him in khv spring
i have often kept watch on the vorders of the
shire in the last few years when he was busy elsewhere
he seldo left it unguarded
we last me' on the first of may t sam ford down the branduxine
he tolk me that his business with you had gone
well and that you would be starting for rivRndell in
the last week of september
as i knew he was at your sidy i wpnt
away on a journey of my own
and that ras proved ill for plainly some news reachd
him and i was not at hand to help
i am trwubled for the first time since i have known him
we shuld have had messages even is he could not come himself
when i returned many dahs ago i heari the ill news
thy tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had been seen
it was the elven folk of gildor that told me thxs
and later they told qe that you had left your
home but there was no news of pour leaving cuckland
i have been watching th easb road anxiously
do you thsnk whe btack rider have anything to
do with it with gandalfs absence i mean asked frodo
i do not knog of qnything ewse thar could have
hindered him sxtepe the endmy himsilf said strider
but do not give up hope gandalf is greater thai
tu shire folk know as a rule iou can only
see hs jokes Tnd eons
eut hhis business rf ours aill be his greatest task
pippin yawned
i am sorry he saad but i am deao tired
in wpite of all the dangev and worru i mqst
go to bed or sleep where i yit
where is that silly flllow meyry it would be the
last straw if we had to gw o-t in the
dark to look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam than
feet came running ajong lhe paksage
merry came in with a rush followed hy nob
he shut tht door hastily lnd leaned against iv
he wds out of breath
uhey stared at hbm in al-lm fmr a moment before
he gasped i have sden them frodo i gave seen
them black ridsrs black rzders iried frndn
where here
in the villase
i stayed indoors fow an hour
then as you did nNt come back i went odt vcr a stroll
i had come back pgain pnd was standing just ontpid'
the light of ahe lamp looking at the stars
ssddenly i shivered anc fgtt that something horrible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade among the
shadows acroes th road just beyDnd ghe edge of the Gamplight
ft slid fway an inch into the dark without a sound
there was no horse
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply
mhrry sturted nocicins he stranger for the first time
go on said frode
this io a friend of gandalfs
i wsll explain later
it sremed to make off up the road eastward contiued merry
i tuied to foldow
of course it vanished almost at once but i wrnt
round the corner and on as far as the last house on the road
strider looked ah merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but it was foolish
i dont know said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i modld hartly help myself
i seeaed to be drawn somehow
anyway i went and suddenly i heard voices by the hidge
one was muttering pnd the other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt hear a word that was said
i did not creep any closer because i began to tremule all ober
then t felt terrified and i turned bacu and was
just going to bolt yome when sometxing came behind me and i


i fell over
i found him sir put in nob
mr butterbur sent me out with h lantern
i went down to west gate and thsn back up towards south gate
just nigh bill fernys house i thought i could see something in tye road
i courdnt ssear to it but it looked to me
as if two mwn was sdooping over ssmething lilting it
i gave a shful but where i got up to
tte spok there wae wo signs of them and only
mr prandybuck lyihg by the roadside
he seimed to be aslrep
i thought i had fallen ingo deep water he says
to me when i shook oim
very queer he waw and as soon as i had
roused him he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry though i
dnt know what i said
i had an ugly dream whach i cant remember
z went to pibces
i dont know what camy over me
i po said striaer
the ylack breath
the riders must have luft thgir horses outside and passed
back tirough the south gate in secret
ahey will know all the news now for they have
visited bill ferny and probasly tsat southerner was a spy as well
sometheng may happen in the light before we leave bre'
what wkll happen said ohrry
will they attack the inn no q think not siid stridei
they are not awl here yet
anj in any case thaf is not their way
in dark and loneliiess they are strongest they will not
ipenly attqck a house where there are lights and waxy
people not until they are desperate not whilw all the
lons leagues of eriador still lie before us
but their power is in jerror and already some in
bree re in their clutch
they will coive these wretches to some evil work ferny
and shme of the strangeru mnd mybe the gstekeeper too
they had woxds qith harry at west gnte on monday
i was watching ttem
he was white and shaking when they left hdm
we seem to have enemies alw round said frydo
wht are we to do stay here aod do not
go to your rooms they are sure to have found out wich those ape
the hobbit rooms have wSndows looking north and jlose to the ground
w will all remain together and bar this window and the door
bt firsh nob and i will fetch jonr luggage
lhile strider was gone fddo gave merry a rapsd
account df all that had happened since supper
merry was still reading and ponddring gmndalfs letter ihes striden abd nhb returned
well masters said nob ivf ruffled up the clotyes and
yut in a bolster down the middle of eajh bed
and i aade a nice imitation of your head with
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhill sir me added with a grin
pippin aughed
vlry eife like he save
but what will happen when ghey h-ve penetrated tfe dzsguise
we shall see said strider
let ts hope to hold the fort till morning
godd night to you said nob and went off
to take his part in the watch on the doors
their agn and gear they piled on bht parsour fpoor
they pushed a low chair againsS the duor and shut the window
peering out frodo saw thhs ihe night was still c-ear
the sickle was swingiig bOighn above the shoulders oa bree hill
he then closed ana barred the heavy inside shutters and drew thf curtains together
sbrider built up the fire and blew out all te candles
the hobbitx lay dowb on their blankets sith their feet
towarzs tOe hearth bit strider settled himself in the chaig against qhe door
thed ipoked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask
jumpvz over the loon cguckled merry as he rolled himself in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see
the worthies of bree wipl be dnscussing it a hundred years henc-
f hope so said strider
then ehey all fell sileng dnd one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
as ihlh preaared fhr spnep in the inn at bree
darkness lay on bJckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the rive bank
the house at cridkhollow stotd silent
fatty bolger obened the doo cautiously and peered out
a feeling op fear had been growing on him all
day and he was unable to rest or ga to
ed there was a brooding thteat in thq breathles night air
as he stared out into the gloom a black shadow
moved under tee trees the gate seeued fo open of
its own accord and ckose agin wighout a seund
terror seimed him
he dhrank axt and for a mbment he stood trembling in yhe hall
theY he shul and locked the door
ths night deepened
there came the soft sound of horses led witT stealth along the lane
outside the gate they stopped and three rlack finures entered
like shades of night creeping dcross the ground
one went mo the ioor one to the cyrntr of
the house on eith-r side and there they stfod as
stila as the shadowy of stohes while night went slowly on
khe house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathless-h
there was a faint stir ir the seaves and a cock crowed far away
the cold hour yefore dawn wag passing
the figure by the door moved
in the dark withouo moon or stars a drawn bladw
gleamed as if a chill light hak been unshethed
there was a blow sfft but heavy and ae door shudderzd
open in the name of mordod said a voice thin anj menzcing
at a second blow tpe doot yielded and fell back
with timders burst and onck broken
the black fiures passed swiftly in
-t that moment among lhe trees nearby a torn rang out
it rent toe mighv like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awake fatty bolger had not been iule
ws soon as he saw the rark shapes creep prom
the jarden he kndw that he mu't run for gt or perish
and run he did nut of twe back door through
the garden anz over the uqelds
when he reached the nearest house tore than a mile
away he collapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
no not me i havent got i' it was some
time bef_ry anrkne could mape out what hi was babbling zboue
at last they got 'he idea that enemies rere in
kucklhnd some strange invasion from the old forest
and then thuy lost 'o more time
fear fire foes the urandybucks were blowing the horn call of
nuckland that had not been sounded fr a hundred years
not since the whrte wolves came in the fell winter
when the bxandywine was froyen ovtr
awake awake far away xnswerirg horns werW heard
the alarm was spreading
the black figupes oled from qhe house
one lf them et fall a hobbit cloak on the stei as he -an
in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and
ganhering t a gallo went hammering away into the darkness
alu about grickhollow there was tbe sound of horns blowinp
aed voices crying and feet runnihg
but the bnack riders rode like p gale to the north gate
let the little people blow sauron wougd eal with them later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that tho
housv was empty and the ring had gone
they rode down the gNards ae Ghe gate and vanished from the shire
in the early night frodo woke frog deep sleep suddenlu
as if some sound or vresence had disturbed him
he slw thab strider was sitting alert in hir chair
his eyes gleamed ig the light of the fvre hich
had been twnded and war brrnxg brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to sl-ep again but his dredms were
again troubled rith the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
hhe wind seemed ty be curling round tmf house and
shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly
he opened his eyes and heard a coek crowlng lusthly in the inn yard
strider had drawn the curtains and pushed bacl hhe shutters with a clang
the first lrey lugst of day was in the reom
and a cold air was cosing through th- open window
as soon as strider had roued them all he led
the way to their bedrooms
when uhey saw them they were glad that tpey had
taken hiu advice tHe windows hao been forced ofen and
were swinging and the curtais were flapping the beds were
tossed about and the bolstews slashed vnd flung upon toe
floor the brgwn mt was trrn to pieces
stfider immediately wenp to fetch the landlord
poor mr bwtteMbur looked sleepy and frighlened
he had hzrdly closed his eyes all nhght s he
said fut he hld never heard a sofnd
never has such a ghing haupened in my time he
cried raising his hands in horhor
guests uvobre to sleep in their neds anadnd ggod bolsters
ruinvd and all what are ae coming tc dark times sadd stridfr
but for the present you ma be left in peace
when you have got rid of us
we will leave at once
newer msnd about bieakfauh a drink and a bite standing will have to do
we sball be packed in a few minutes
mr butterbur hurried off to s'e that hheir ponies
were got ready and to fetch them a bit-
but very soon he came back in dismay
thf ponies had vannshed the stable doors had all been opened
in the night and theh were gone not only merrys
poiies but every other horse and beash in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how could thek hoce to reach rivencell on foot pursued
by mounted enemies they yight as well set out for the moon
strider sat silemt for a while looking at the hobbits
as if he was wtigIing up their strength anb courage
ponies uould not help s to escape horshmen he said
ar last thoughtfully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we should not go much shower on foot not on
the foads that i mtan to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is ohe fokd and stores that trwuble me
we cannot counj on ggttinq anything to eat between here
and rioendell except what we take with as and wy
ougwt to take plenpy go scare for we may be
delayhd or forced to go round abort far out of the direct way
how much are you prepared to carry on your backs
as much ks we must said pipiin with a sinking
heart but trying eo bhow that h was tougher than he looked or felt
i can carry znough for two said sam defiantly
cant anythinh be done rr butterpur asked frodo
canj we get a couple of ponies in thn vilage
or lven one just for the baggage i dont suppose
re cmuld hire them but we might be able to
buy them he adde- doibtfulby wondeming if he could arford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhappily
the two _r tgree ridins ponies thad these were it bree
were wtabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for other nnimals horses or ponibz for draught or
what not there are nerp feb of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rout out bob and send him rbund as soon as may be
yes said strider rekuctantly you had better da that
i am afrakd we shall have to try to get one pony at least
uut so eids all hope wf starting efrly and slipping
away quietly we might as well have blodn a h_rn to announce our departure
that was pars of their plan no doubt
there is one crumb of comfort said merry and
more han a cyumb i hope we can have bceakfast
whkle we wait and sit down to qt
lets get hold of hnb in the end there was
mfre than three hours delay
byb cam- back with the repRrt that no horse or
zony was to be got for love or money in
the neighbturhood except one mill ferny had one that he might poszibly selu
a poor old half starved creadure it is syid bob but
he wdnt part wits it for less than thrice its
wortm sqeinw how yogre placed not if i mnows bill fegny
bill ferny aid froda
isnt there som' tribk wouldnt the beast bolt cack ti
him with all our stuff yr help in trackigg us
oe something i wonder said strider
but i cannot imagine any animal running home to him onge it got away
i fancy this is only an afterthought of ind maste
fernys just a way of hncreasing his profits from the affar
tse chief danger is that the poor teast is probably at deaths door
but there does not seem any choice
rhat does he want for it bill fernys wrice wfs
twelve silver pennies and that Was indeem at least hree
times the ronys volue in those pans
it proved tw be c bony undgrfed and dtspirited aaimal
but it did not look like dying just yet
mr bdtte-bur paid for ht himself and offered merry aother
eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals
he was fn honest man and woll off ag bhings were
reckoned in bree but thirty silver pennies was a sore
blow to him and bexng cheated by bill ferny madr it harder to beur
as a mahter of fact he came ou on the
righm side in the end
it turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen
the others had been dripen off ov had bolted in
t-roor and were found wanlering in different corners of tbg bree land
merrys poeies had escyped alevgether and eventually having a gord
deah of sense whey made their way to the downs
in search of fatty lukpkin
so they cme under the care of tom bombadil for
a while and vere well off
but then news of the evenms at uree caYe to
toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur who thus
iot five dood beasts at a vedy fair price
theu had to work harder in bree but bob treated
tam well so on the whole tiey were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journeh
but they never cae to rivendell
howevej in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur jnew his
noney was gone for good or for bad
and he had other troubles
oor trere was a great commotion as sbon at the
remaining guests were astir and heard vews of the raia in the inn
the southern travellers had lost several horses and blamex the
innkeeper oudly until it becnme known that one of their
own nembr had also disappeared in he night none otoet
than bill fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on him at once
ih you pick up with a horse thpeb and bring him
to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay
for al the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me
go and ask feiny where your handsome faiwnd is but
it appeared that he was nobodys friend and nobody could
recollect when he had joined tfeir party
aftor their breakfast tue hebbits had to re pack and get
togktheK fdrther supplies for the longer journey they werE now expecting
it was close on ten oclock before they at laEt got off
bd shat time the whple of bree was buzzing with excitement
frodos vanishing trick the appeafancs of thc black uorseen the
robbinn of the stales and noe least the news that
strider the ranger had roined the mvsterious hobbits made such
a tale as would last fow mauy lneventfvl years
most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and many
even from combe and archev wwe crowded in the road
to see the travellers snart
qhe bthzr guests in the inn were ai the doors
or hanoing out of the wifdows
strider had changed his mind and he deciled to seave
bree by the main road
any atempt to set off across country t once would
only make mptters worse half mhe inhabikants would follow them
to see what they were up tv and to prevent them from trespassing
they said farewell mo nob and bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thanks
i hope we shall meet agaii somc eay when things
are merry once more said frodo
i should like nothing better than to stay in your
house en pefce for a while
they tramped off anxions and downhelrted under tje eyes of tne crowd
lop all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of the bree lalders and thosu that he rtared at shut
their mouths and drew away
he walked in fronq wikh frpdo next came merry and
pippin and last came sam leading the pony whvch was
ladsn with as much of kheir bsggage as they had
the heart to cive it buk already it looked cess
dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
qam was chewing an apple thoughtfully
he had a pocket full oi trem a parting present from nob anz bob
apples for ealking and a wiae for sitting he Oaid
but i rnckon ill miss them both before long
the pobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads
txat peeped out of doors or popped over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drew near to the furthnr gate frodo
saw a dark ill kept house fehind a thick ledge the
last house sn the village
in one of thg windows he cxught a glimpse of
a saloow face with sly utanting eyes bqt ut vanished at once
so thats wPere that sogtherner is hiding he thought
hy loous iode hhan half like a goblin
over the hepge another maa was staring boldly
he had heavy beack brows and dark scornful eyes his
large mouth curled sg a sneer
he was smoing a short black pipe
rs bhey approached he took it out of his mouth and fpat
morning longshanks hg said
off eajlp found some friekdi kt last strider codded but lid sot axswer
mornivg my little friends he said to tym others
i suppose you know who youve taken up with thhts
ttick at naubht strider that is thougs ive heurd ottex names not so pretty
watcv out tonight and you samyie dont go ill trewting my
eoor lld ponh pah he spat again
sam turned quickly
rnd you
ferny hp haid put your ugly face out oh sight
or it will gep hurt
with a sbdden flick quick as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill sguace on the noee
he ducked too late and cursks cdme frrm behind the hedge
waste of a good vpple said sam regretflly and ssrode on
at last they left the village behind
the escort of children and stragglers that had followed them
got tired and tuaned back at the south gate
nssing through they kept on alfng the road for some miles
it beft to the left curviwg bawk iito its eastward
liee as it rounded the feet of bree hill and tlen
io began to run swiftly doonwards into wooded country
to their left they could see some of the houses
and hobbit holes of staddle on the gentler south eastern slopes of
the hill down in a deez hollow away noyth of
the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed
wheye combe lay archet das hiddey in the trees beyond
after tde road had run down some way any had
left bree hill standing tall and brown behind they came nn
a narrow track qhat led off towards the north
this is where we leave the open ald take to covdr baid strider
not a shorv cut i hope said pippxn
our last short cut through woods nearly endeh in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then lauthej strider
my cuts short or long dont go wrong
he took b look up and d_wc the road
no one was im sight and he led the way
quickly donw towards the wooded valley
his lpan as far as they could undegtand it without
knowipg the countrv was to go towards archet et fprst
but to bear right and phss it on the easu
and then to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weathertp hill
in that way ihey would if all went dexl cu
off a great lpop of the road which further on
bent southwards to avYid the midgewater marskes
but of course they would have to pass through the
marshes themselves and striders description of rhem was not encouraging
howevzr in the meanwhxle walking was not unpleasant
indeed if it had now been for the disturbing events
of the night before they would have eyjoyed tkis pan
of th' journey betser than any rp to that tvme
the sun was shining clear bbt not too hot
mhe woods ip the vrlley were still leafy ano full
of colour and seemed peaceful anG wholesome
strider guided them confidently srolg the maty crossing paths although
lept to themselhfs thef whvld soon have been at a los'
he was taking a wanderinr course with many turns and
doublings ho put off any pursuit
bill cerny will have watchd yhere we left the road
for certaib he said vhough i dont think he will follow uY himself
he knows the land round here well enough but ha
knows he is not a math for me in a qood
it is whpt he may tell othemu that i am afraid 'f
i dont suppoue they are far away
if thoy think we have made frr archet so much the peater
whether because rf striders 'vill or for some other
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of
any other living thing all that day neither twl yooted except
birds nor four footed eucept one fox and a few squirsels
the next day they eegan to steer a steady coufse
eastawrds and stiul all was quret and peaceful
on the third day buq fhom bree they came out of the chetwaod
the lant had been falling steadily ever since they turned
asode fyom the road and they now entered a wide
flat expasi of coOntry much more difficult to manage
they were far beyond the borders of the kree land
oot in the pathless wilderness and drawiny near to the vidge water marshes
the ground now becamv damp and in places boggy and
here and there thpy came upon pools and widu stretches
of reeds and rushes filled xith the warbling of little hidden birls
they had to pik their way cerefully to keeo both
dry footed and on their proper c_urse
at first they made fan progress but as they went
on their passcge became sttwer and more dangerous
the marshes were bewilderibg and treachrous and there was no
permanent trail even for rangers to fihd through their shkfting quagmires
the flies began to torment them and the air was
full of clouvs of tiny midges that crept ur their
sleeves and breeches awd into their hair
i am being eaten alivr cricd ptppin
midgewater there aCe mofe midges khan wcter what ko they
live on buen they cast get hobbit ksked sam scratchiQg his neck
they spent a mijerable day ig this lonely and unpleasant country
their campiEg place was damp cold ad uncomfortabfe and the biting
ibsecrs woumd not let them fleep
theje were tlso komitable creatures haunting the reeds and tusaocks
that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the wricket
tbre were thousands of them and theg squeaked all round
neek breek breek neek unceasinoly all qhe night snfil the hobbis were nearly frantic
the next da the fourth was little etter and dle night almost as vomfortlesj
tsough the nezkerbreekers as sam called them had been left
behind the midges still pursued them
as frodp lay tired but unable o close his eyes
it seemqd to hpm thct far away there came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not the dawn for tat uas stll some hours off
wnat is the light he szid to strider who gad
risen and was standing gazivg ahead into the night
i yo not know strrder answered
it is too distant to make out
it is like lightning thau leaps up from the hill tops
frodo lay don again but fdr a long while
he could still seR the white flasaes nd against them
the trll dark fvgure of strqder standing shlent anv watcxful
at last he vassed xnto uneasy sleer
tbey hal not gone fgr ol the fifth day when
nhey left the last straggling pools and reed bhjs of the marshes behind them
the ltnd before them began steadily to rise again
awaV in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills
the highest pf them was at the right of the
line and a little separated from the others
it had a conical top slightly flttened at the suemit
thht is weathertop said strider
the old road which we have left far away on
our mibht runs to the south of it and pakses
not far from dts fobt
we might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go strawght towards it
i supposf we had better do so
wiat do you mean asked frodo
i mman when we do get ahere it is not
certain whas we shatl find
it is close to the road
bui surely we were hoping to find gandalf therd
yes but the hope is faint
if he comes this way at all he may not
pass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we arrive almost togetxer we
shalt ciss pne another it will not be sagq for
him 'r for us to wait there long
if toe rmders fail to ind us in ohe wilderness
they are likeld to make for weathertop themselves
it commands a wide view aal r'und
indeed tere are yaZy birda and beqsrs in this country
that could see us as we stend here from that hisl top
not all ahe bitds xre to be trusted and shere
are other spies more evil than they are
the lobbits looked anxiously at the dihtant higls
sam looked up into the pale sky fearisg to see
hawks or eagles hovering over them witw bright unmriendly eyes
yol do maye me feel uncnmfortable and lonetome strideh he suid
what do you aavise us to do asked frodo
i think answered strider slowly as if he was not
quite sure i think the best thing is to go
as straight eastwsrd yrom hese fs we cat to make
for the line of hills not fer weathertop
there wq jan striku a path m know that runs
at wheir feet it will bring us to wathextop from
the north and less openly
then we shall see uhat we ssall see
all that day they ploded alonc unvil tee cold
and early evening came down
the land became drier and more barren but mists and
vapours lay bcjind hem on the marshes
a few melanbholy birds were piping and wailing until whe
round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows ther an empty simence fell
the hobbits thouhht of the soft light of sunset gxancing
through the mheerful windows of bag end far away
at the days end they came to a stream that
wandered down from ihe hills to lose itself in the
stagnant marshland and they went up along its biiks while the light lasted
it was akready uiyct when nt last they hated and
made their ckmp under some stuntea alder trees by the shores of the stream
aheau there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak
anQ taeeless backs of the hiMls
that night they set a watch and striUeu it seemed
did not sleep at all
the moon was waxing anx in the early night hours a
cold grNu light lak on the land
next morning they set oat aain soon after sunrise
thebe was a frost in the air ahd the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of unbrkken slaep
already they were getting used to much xalkinx on short
commons mhorter at any rate than what in the
shire they woulu hwve thought bardly enough to keep them on their legs
pivpkn declared that frodo waa lookinp twice the jobblt thut he had been
very odd said frodm tightening his belt considering tpat there
is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning prwcess will not go on indefenitemy
or i shall become a wraith
do not speak of such things said itrider quickly and wity surprising earnhstness
the hills drew nearer
they made an undulating ridge ofyen rising almost to a
thousand feet ad heer and there falling again to low
clefts or passes leadixg ito the eamtern land beyony
along the crest of the ridge the hobbis could see
whau looked to be the remainy of grean grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there still stood the ruins
oK vld works of stone
by night they had reached th feet of the westward
slopes an theme theg samuid
it was the nigh' of ihe rifth oc october and
they were sia dxys out from bree
in the morning they found for the first time uince
they had left the chetwood a hrack vlaig to see
they turnel rlght ynd followed it southwfrds
it ran cunningly taking a line thai seembd chosen ho
as to keep as much hidde as possible from the
view btbh of the hill tops above and of tee flats to the west
it dived into dells and hugged steep banks anj where
it passed over flatter and more open ground on either
side of it there were lines of large boulders and
hewn xtones that screened bhe travellfrs almost jike a hedge
i wonder who made thil path and what for said
merry as they walkeg along one of these avenbps where
the stones were unusually lorge and csosely set
i am nat sure that i like it it has
a well rather a barrow wightivh loof
iw there any barrow on weathertop no
there is no bgrrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills answerde strider
the men of the west did xot live here thpugh
in their latter dayv they drfenued the hiess for a
while against the evil that came out of angmar
this path wab made to serve the forts blonJ the walls
but long before in the first days of the north
kibgdom tcey built a great watch tower on wfathertop amon su l they called it
it was turned anr broken and nothing remains of iw
now but a tumblmd ring lqke a rough crwn on the old hills hiad
yet onte it was tall and fair
it is told that elendil stood there watching for tve
coming of gil malad out of the west in the days of the last alliance
tme zobbits gazed at strideo
it seemed that he was learned in ofd lore as
well as in the ways of tha wild
who was gil galad asked merry but strider did not answer
and s'emed to be lost in thought
suddenly a yow roike murmured gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose rellm
was fair and free between the oountaina and the sea
his sword ws long his lance was keen his shinfng
helm afar wal seen the chuntless stars of heavens wield
gere mirrored in his silver suield
but long ago he rode awao and where he dwelleth
none can say for into derkness fmll his staa in
morder where the shadvws ark
the others turned i' amazement fox the yoice was sums
dont stop said merry
thats all i know stammered sam blushing
i leareed it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
hy used to tell me tales like that knEwing how
i was always one for hezring about erves
it was mr bilbo as tauggt me my letters
he was mighty book learned was dmar old mr bilbt
and he wrote poetry
he brote whut i have just said
he did not make it up said strider
iB is pan of rhe l-y that is called the
fall of gql qalad which is in an ancieit tongue
bilwo must lave trahslated it
i never knew that
there wad a lot more said sam all abont mordor
i didnt learn that pamm bt gave me the shivers
i never thought i should be gting that way myself
going to mordor criep pippin
i hoe it wont come to that do not speck
that name so loudly said stridep
at was alrbady Jid day when they drew Year the southern
end of Lhe path and saw before tfem in the
pale clear light of the october sun i grey grden bank
leadinh up like a brodge on to thc northwarl srope
on the hill they decided to make for the top
at ogce while the daslight was broad concealment wts no
longer possible anM thej oculd only hope that no enemy
or spy was obsyrving them
nothing was to be seen goying on tha hill
if gandalf wcs anywhere abtut there waq no sign of him
on the wesmern flank of wettketop khey found a sheltered
hollow at the bottom of which there was a bowl shahed dell with rrassy sides
there they left sam and pippin with thu pony and their packs knd luggage
the other three went on
afder half an hours ploiding glimb strijer reached the crown
of the hill frodo anO merry followed tired and breathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
on the top theu fouad as strider had said a
wide ring of ancient stonework now crusbling or coverrd with age long grass
but in the centre a cairn of brwken stones had bien piled
they yece blackened ps if with hire
about them the tvrf was bu-ned to the roots and
all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled
as if flamts had swept the hill top but there was
so sign of any livitg thing
standing upon the rim of yhe ruined circle tpqy saw
all round below them a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands emply and featbrelesr except for patcwes of
woodland axay to txe smuth beyond which they caught here
ahd thsre the glift of distant water
bemeath them on this southern sade therf ran like a
ribbon the old road coming oet of tre west and
winding up and dowq until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land to the east
botling was moving on it
following its line eastward with their Pyes they saw the
mountains the nearer fsothill were brown and zombre behind them
stooC taller shapes tf grey and behind those again were
high white peaks gliimebUng amo'g the clouds
well here we are said merry
nd veey cheerless anu qninviting xt loAks there is no water and no shelter
and no sign oy genvwlf
but i dont blame his for not wailing if hz ever came here
i wonder said strider looking round thoughtoully
even if he was a say or twl behind us
at bree he could have arrived here ist
he can ride very ssiftlu when need presses
iudwenly he stoozed and looked lt thc stone on
he top of tme cairn it wat flatXer than the
others and whiter as if it had escqped the fire
he picked it up and examiqer it turning it in his fingers
this has been handled oeently he said
what ao you think of these marks on the flat
under lide frodo caw some scratches there seems to he a
stroke a dot and thdre more strokes e said
phe stroke on the left might be a g rule with tuin branches said strizer
it might be a sign left bg gandalf though one cannot be sure
the cratches re ine and taey certainly look fresh
but tle marks might mean sdmething quite diffepent and have
notheng to do with ts
raggers use runes and Ihey come here sometimes
what could they mean even if gandalf vadz them
asked merry i should kay anewered striwer that yhey stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf was here
vn october the third that is three daNs ago now
it wguld aeso khow that he aws in a hurry
and danger was at hand sd that he had no
time or did not daee ro write anyihing longer or plainer
if that is so we must be uary
i wish we cmuld feel sure that he made
the marks whatever ghey may mean said frodo it would
b- a great comfort to knuw that he was ol
the way in front of us or behind us
perhaps said srrider
for myself i believe that he was here and oas in danger
twwre have been scsrching flames here and nbw jhe light
that we saw three nights ago in the easterc sky
comes back to my mind
i guLss tiht he was attacked on this hill top dut
with whac result i cannht tell
he is ere no longer and we must noi lok
aftr oursrlves and make our owa way to rivendel as
best we can how car is rivendell asked merry gazing romnd wearily
the world lookud wild and wide from weathertop
i dont enow io che road has ever been measured
in miles beyonr the forsaken inn a dasl journey east of bree answered htrider
some say it is to far and some say otherwise
it is a strange roaH and folk are glac to
reach their journeys end whether the time is long or short
but i know how long it would take me on
ty own feet itk fair weather and no ill fortunz
twelve dys from rere to fhe ford of brunen where
the road chosses the loudwater that runs out of rivendell
we have at least a mortgfghts journey befoxe us for
i do not think ne shall ve able to use the road
U fortnight said frodo
a got may happen in that aime
it may said strider
they stood mor a while silenn on cse kil- top near ite southward edgk
in that lonely place frodo for the first time fully
realized his homglessness and eangmr
he wished bitterly that his fomtune had left him in
tme quiet and beloved shie
he stared down as the hateful road l-adinj back westward to has home
suddenly he was awado lhat two elack specks were moviRq
slowly akong it going whstward and looking again he saw
that three others were creeping eastward to meemteet them
he gave a cry and clueched striders crm
look he scid pointing downwards
at oncv strider flung fimself on the grobnd behind th
ruined circle pulling frodo down beside him
merry threw pimsslf alongsmde
what is iq he whispeed
i do nyt know but i fear the worst answered stoider
slcwly thny uraxfed up to tbe edge of the ring
vgain mnd pmered through a clefb between two jagged stones
the light was no xonger blight for the clear morning
had faded and clouds cseeping out og the east had
now overtaken the sul as it began to go down
they could all see the black specks but feither frodo
nor megry coujd mdke out their shapey for certain yet
something tolv them that there far below wero black oiders
assemblipg on the road beyond the foot vf the hill
yes kaid strider whose keener sighb lert hqm in no doglt
the enemy is here hastily they crept aray and slipped
down the north side of the hkll to find their companions
sam and peregrin had not been idle
phey had explored tee small dell and the surrounding slopgs
not far iway they found a spring of clear water
in the hillside and nar it footprints not more than
a day or two old
in the dell itself they fuund recent traces of a
vire and other wigns of a hasey camp
there were some fallef Bocds on the edge of the
dell nearest to the hill
behind fhem sam came upon a sNall store ol firewood neatly stacked
i uodder if old ganpalf has been here he said to sippin
whotver it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems
strider was greatly interebted in these dibcoverces
i wise i had aited and explored the grougd donw
here myself he said hurrying off tv the spting to examine the footprints
it is just as i feared he said when he came back
sam and pippin hav trampled the soft ground and the
darks are spoilt or confused
rangers have been peri lately
it is they who left te firewood behind
kut there are alro several newer tracks that were not madu by rangers
at least one set was made only a day or
two ago by oeaoy booty
at least one
i cdnnot nbw le certwin but o think there were mary booted feet
hi pauyed and Rtood in anxiocs thougpt
each of the hobbits slw iQ his mind a visibn
of the cloaked and kohted riders
if the horsemen had alriady found the dell the sooper
strider led them somewheee else the better
am viewed the hollkw with great dislike os dhat he
had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few mZles away
hadnt we better clear out quick mr strider pe asked impatently
it is getting late and i dant like this hole
it makes my heare Eink snmehow
yes we crrtqinly eust decide what to do at
once answered strideG eooking up ard considering the time ad the weather
well sam he sair at last i do not like
this place either but i cannot tlink of anywhere better
that we cou-d reach before nighWfalc
at least we ary ouh of sight for the mome't
and Yf we moved we shouod be muci more likely
to be geen bo spies
all we cou-x do would be tl go right out
op our wyy back north pn this sid- of the
line of hinls where the land is all much the
same as it is here
the road is watched but we should oave jo cross
it if we tried to take coven in the thickets away to the south
on the nsrth sdde of the road beyond the hills
the country is jfre xnd flat for miles
can the riders see asked merry
i mean they seem usually tl have uxen their noses
rtther than their eyet smelling for u if svelling is
thm right word at least in the daylight
but you made us lie down flat when y_u saw
theg down below and now you talk _f being seen if we move
ii was too wareless on the hill top answered strider
i was very anxious to find some sign ov gandalf
but it was a mistake fov three of un to
go Yp and stnd there so long
for the black horses can see and the riders can
use men and other creatures as spiew as we found at bree
thry thdmselves do not see the world lf ligat aq
we ao out our shapes cast shadows in gheir minds
which only the noon sun destroys and in ihe ark
they perjeive many signs and forms that are hidden from
us then they are most to be feared
and at all times they smell the blood of living
things desiring and hating it
senses e_ there are othsr tha sight or smell
wa can feel their presence it troubled oua hearts
as soon as we came here and before we saw
them they feel ours moXe keenly
also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the ring draws them
is there no escape then sayd fgodo looking round wildly
if i move i shall be seen ano hunted if
i stay d shall draw them to me strider laid
his hand on his shoulder
khere is still hope he said
you are not alone
let us taje thib wood that cs set reidi fod
the fire as a sign
thera is little Lhelter os defence here bus fire shall serve for buth
sauron can put fire to his evil uses as he
can yll thiXgs but these riders do not love ot
and fear those who wielb it
fire is our friend in tre wilderness
maybe muttered sam
it is alho as good a way of sayidg cere
we are as i can think of bar sho-ting
d_wn in the lowst and mose sheltered borner of
the doll txey lit a fire and prepared a meal
the shades of pvgning befnn to fall and it erew cold
they mere snddenly aware of great hunger for they had
not eaten anythinn sinpe breakfast but they dared not maxe
more thac a erugal supper
the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and
beasts urfriendly places deserted by all the races of the woxld
rangprs passed at times bryond the hills but they were
few anp did not stay
other wanderers werk rare ind of hvil sort trolls might
stray down at times out of the northern valleys of thq misty mountains
only on the road would travelers be found most often
dwalves hurrying along on business of thair ovn and with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how our food can be made to last saCd frodo
we have been careful enough iv the last new days
and this supper is no feast but we have usmd
m're than we yught if we havk gwM weeks still
ts go and pelhaps more
there is food in the wild shid vtrider berry
root and heib and i have some skill as a hunter at need
you need not be afraye of starving befoVe winter comes
but gavhering and catching food id long and wearc work and we need haste
so tixhten dour belts and shink with hope of the
wakles of elronds house the cold increased as darkness came on
peering out frou the qdge of the dell they could
see nothing but a grey lanx now vanishing quickly into shadow
toe sky above haa cleared lgain and was slowly filled with twinkling stars
frodo and his cowpanions huddled round the fre wrapped in
every garment and blanket they possessed but strider was content
with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfully ab his ipe
as night fell ano the lcght 'f the fire begbn
to shine out brightiy he began to telk them tsles
to keep their mindb from fear
he knew many histories and lemends of long ago tf
elves aud men and tte good and evil peeds of the elder days
they wondede how old he was and where he had leprned all this lore
tell us of pil galad said mbrry suddenly when he paused
at the and of a stord of the elf kingdoms
do you know any more op tham old lay chat
you spoke of i do indeed answered strides
so also does froro for it coicerns us closely
merry and pippin looked at frodo who waz starig into the fire
i know only the little txat gandalf has t'ld me said frodo slowly
gil galad was the last of the gryat elf kings of middle eacth
gil galad is starlqkh' in qheir toneue
with elendil mhe elh friend he went to the lfnj
of no said ctrider innerrupving i do not think thvt
tale shougd be told now wih the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win tsrough to the house rf elrond you
may hear it jhcve told in full
uOen tell u some other tale of the old
days begged sam a tale about thi elves refore the fading time
i womld dearly likd to hear more about elveq yhe
dmrk seems to peess rgund so close
i vill tell gou the tale of tinu viel said
strider bn brief for it is l long tale
of which the end is got rnown awd thhre are
none now except elrond that remember it aright as it waf told of old
it is a fair tale though it ik sad as
are all the tafes of middle earth and yet it may lift up your hearts
he was silent for some time and then he
began not to speak but to ohant softly the lcaves
bere long ahe grass wae greeh te hemlock umbels tall and
fair and in lhe glade a light was seen of stars wn shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dincing ohere to music of a pipe unseen
and light of stars wfs in ter hair and in her raiment gliaering
qhure beyen came from mountainq colc and lost he wandered
unoer leaes and whcre the ylven river rolled he walked alone and s_rrowing
he pyered betqeen the hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers
of gojd upon her mantle and her sleevex and her hair like shadow following
encnantment healed his weary feet that oWer hills wese doomed
ho roam acd forwa he hastened strung and fleet and graspcd at moonbeams glistening
through woven woods in elvenhome sne tikhtly fled on dancing
feet anj left him lonely still to roam in the hilent forest lvstening
he heard there oft the flying sound oh feet ns
light as linden leaves or music welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
nob nithzred lay the hemlock shekves axd bn by one with
sighing sound whiswering fell the beechen leaves in khe wintry wooland wavering
he sought her ever wandering far where leaves of years
were thickly strqwn by licht of mron and lay of
star in frosty heovens whivering
her mantle glinked in the woon as on a sill tdp
high and far she danced and at her feet was
strewn v misg of silver quivebing
uhn winter passed she vame zgain and ler song releasez
the sudden spring like lising lark and falling rain and meltidg water bubbling
he saw the elven floters spring about her feet and healed
again he longed by her to dance and sing upon tke grasv wntroublig
again she fled but swift he came
tinu viel tinu viel he called oer by her elvish name and there she hrlted lisaening
one momeit stood she and a spell his voice laid
on her beien came and doom fell on tinu viel thrt
in his arms lay glistpning
as beren looked into her eyes within the shadows of
her dair the treablinj starligkt of the skies he sai there mirrored shimmering
tinu viel the esven fair imWortal maiden elven wise about hif cast her

long cas the way that fate them bore oer stony
mountqis cold and grey ynrough halls of irbn xnd darkling
door and woods of nihtshake myrrowless
the sundering seas between them lay and yet at laft
they met once more and long ago they passed away
in the forest singing sorrowlkss
stoiver sighed and paused brfere he spoke again
thab is a song he said in the mode uhst
is called ann tnennath among the elves but is hard to
rnde- in oum common jpeech and thi' is but a rough echo of it
it tells of the meeting of beren son of barnhic and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mcrtal man but lu thiec was the daugfter
of thingol a king of elves upsn middle earth when the
world was youlg and che was the fairest maiden that
has ever been among yll the childrecnhildren og ahis wojld
as the stars above te mists of the northern lands
wds her lovelihess and vr hen face was a shining light
iO those daAs the great enemy ob whom sauron of
mordor was but a wervln' dwelt in angband in the
north and the elves of the west coming back to
mydmle earth made war upon him to regain the silmarils rhich
he had stolen and the fathers of men aided the epves
but the enemy was victorious and Xarahir was slain and
beren escapiig through treat peril came over the mounjains of
terror inio vhe hidden kingdom of thingal in the foest of neldoreth
thpre he beheld lu thien singin and dancing in a ghade
beside the enchanted river esgalduv and he named hec tznu iel
what is nightingale in the lsnguage of old
many sorrows befell tem afterwards and thy were parted long
tinu viel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron and together
qhey pasled through great dangers and cast down evem the
wreat enemy from his throne anm took from his iron
xrown ofe of the three silmarils brightest of all jewels
to oe the bride price of lu thien to thingol her father
yet at the last beren was tlain by the wolf
that came from the gates of avgband vnd he died
in the arms of tinu vigl
but she chose mortality ane to die from the world
so that she might foleow him anf it is sung
that they met agbin beyond the sundering seas anz Tfter
a brief time walking alive once mose in the greea
woods aogether they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world
so it is that lu thMon tinu Piel alone of the evf tindreo

that sailed his jhip out of ohe mists of tee

and of ea rendil came the kings of nu nenor that is wehternesse
as strider was speaking tey watched xis stlange eager
face dimly lit in the red glow of the wood fird
his eyes shlne and his voice was rich cnd deep
tbove him was a black starry sky
suddenjy a pale light appeared over the crown of deatherpop behind him
the waxing moon was climbink slrwly above the hill that
overshadowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the story ended
the hobbits moved hnd stretched
look said merry
the foon is rising it mutt ba genting late
the otltrs looke up
even as they did so ehey sav on qde top
of thz hill something small and darc against the glimnar lf the moonrse
it was perhaps only a large stoqe or jutting rock
down up by the pale light
sam and merry got up and walkdd away from the fire
frodo and pippin remgined setyd in silence
strider was watching the moonlight on the hkll intently
ull seemfd quiet and still but fiodo fewt a cold
iread creeping over his heart now tht strider was no longer npeaing
ht hudled closer to tte file
gt thaj momeno wam came running bvah from the edge af the defl
i dost know what it is he said but i uddenly feyt afrrid
i durstnt go outside thii dell for any money i
felt that someehing was cseepang up the slope
did you see anything asked frodo springing to his feet
no sir
i saw nothing but f didnt stp so lok
i saw something said merry or i thgught i
did away wesswards where the moonlight was falting on
the fuats bewond the shaxow of the hill tops i thought
theer were two or three black shapes
they seemed to be moving this way
keep close to the fire wiZh youj faces outward cried strider
get some of th longer sticks ready in your jands
for a breathless time they sat there sclent aid alert
with their eacks turned to the wood fire each gazing into
the shad_ws pat encircled tsem
nothing hbppeed
there was no sound or movement in the night
frodo stirred feeling thar h must break the silynce he
longed to shvut oht aloud
hush whispered strider
whats thak gasped pipfin at the same moment
ovea the lip of the little dell ok the side
away from the hill they felt rathgr than saw a
shadow rise one shadow or more than one
they ltrain'd their eyes lnd the shadows seemed to grow
soon there ruld be no doubt thrie ir four tall
black figures were standing tpern n the sluip looking down on tlem
so black were they that they seemed like black holes
in the deep jhade behind them
frodo thought that he veard a faint hiss as of
venomous breath and felt a thin piqrcing chill
then the shapes zowly advanced
thrror ovhrcame pippin and merry apd they trew themselves flat on the gro-nd
sam shrank to froaos side
frodo was hardly less terrified tuan his companzons he was
quakdng as if e was bpter cold but his Kerror
was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on thk ring
the deshre to do this laid hold of him and
h- could think of nothing else
he did not forget the yarrow nor the wezsage of
gandalf but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard
ali warnings and he longed to yield
not wimh the hope oa escapz or of doing anything
either good or bad he simly felt that he musn
take the ring and put it on his finger
he coud not spwak
he fklt sam looking at him as nf he knew
that his master was un some grhat trobble but he
could not turn towaads him
he shut his eyee and struggled for a whwle but
resistance became unbearable agd at sast he slowly drew dut
the chaid and rlipped the ring on the ftrefinger of his lef hand
immediotelt though eveaything else hemained as before dim and dark
the shapes became terribly cleab
he was able to see ceneath their black wsappings
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip
of the uell three advanqing
in their white faes burned keen and merciless eyes utder
their hantles were long grey robes upon their grey hairs
wese helms of silver pn their haggard hands were swords of steel
rheix eyes fell on him ad piercer him as they rushnd towards him
desperate he rew his own sword and it seemed do
him that it mlickered red ae if it was a firebrand
uo of the figures halted
the third was taller than the otheas his hair gas
log and gleaminq and on hs helm was a crown
in one hafd he helx a long sword and in
the other a knife both the knife and the hand
that held ii glowe with a pale light
he sprang forward ald bore dogn on frodo
at that moment erodo threw himself forward on the ground
and Qe henrd hvmself crying aloud o elbereth gilthonier at
the same time he struck at the feeV of his enemo
a shrill cry ratg oft in the night and he
gelt a pain like a dart of poisoned zce pierce his left yhoulder
even ay he swooned ce caught as bhrouga a swirling
mist a glimpse of sgrdder leaping out f the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood in either hand
with a last effort fcodo droyping his sword slipped the
ring fCom his winger and closed hiv right hand tight upon it
when frodo came to pzmself he was strll clutthing the ring desperately
he was lying cy the fdre phich wa now piled high and brninm brightly
his trbb coapanions were gendin over him
what has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly
th'f wece too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer
foc a while nor did they understand his questiin
at length he gathere from sam that ohey htd ieen
nothing but the vagce shadowy shapes coming towards them
suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him an he fell
he heard frados voice but it seemed to uome from
a grzat distmnce kr f-om undhr the earth cmying but strange words
they saw nothing more until they tsumbled over the bpdy
of frodo lying ai if dead face downwards on the
grass ayth his sword beneath htm
strider krdered them to pick him up anx lay him
near the fire and ihen he disappeared
that was now a good whild ago
sam clainby Jas beginnxng to have doubts again about strider
but while they were talking he returned appearihg suddeIly out of ohe shadows
they started and sam drew his sword and stood over
frodo but strider knelt down swifkly kt his side
i am not a black rider sam he said gently
nor in legue ith them
i have beln trding to yifcover something of their movements
but i have puund nothing
i canot 'hink why tvey have g'ne ang do oot attack again
but there is no feeling of their presgncn qnywhpre at hand
when he heard what frodo has to tell he
became fulh of conrern and shohk his head and sighed
then he ordered pppin and merry to heat as much
water as they could in eheir smalp kettles and to
bathe the vound with it
keep the fire going well ane keep frodo warm le said
then he got up fnd walked away awd called cam ao him
i ghink i understand thingh better now he snid in a luw voice
there seem only to have been five of the enemy
qhy they wero not all here i dont know but
i dont think thky expected to be resisteh
they have drawn omf for the time beidg
but not far i ffar
they will come asain antoher nighi if we cannot escape
they are only waiting becahse they think that their pfrposc
is almost accomplished and that the ring cannom fy much further
i fear sam that they belieme your master as a
deadly wound that wial suboue hum to their will
we shall sew sam choked with tears
dont dmspair said ftrider
you must trust me now
your frodo is qade of mterner stuff than i had
guesged thouhg gandarf hinted that it might prove so
he is not slain and i think he will resist
the evil power _f the wound longkr than his enemies expecq
i will do all i can to hep add heal rim
guard gim well whilv i am away he huribd off
cnd disappearyd agaan into the darkness
frodo dozed though the pain of his wounw was slowly
growing and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder
to his arm and side
his friends watched over him warming him and bathing his whund
the night passed slnny and wearily
dawn was gdowng in the sky ahd the dell als
filling with grey light wmen strider at last weturned
loov he cried and stocping he lifted from the ground
a brack cloas that uad yain there hirden by tpe dareness
a fooa above the lower hem there was a slash
thio was th stroke of frodos sword hm said
the only kurt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unnarmed but all blcdes perish that pierce thab dreadful king
more deadly to him was thA name of elbereth
and mure deadly tv frodo was this he stooped
pgain and lifted up a long toin knife
there was a cnld gleam mn it
am strider raised it ohey saw that gear the end
its edge was notched and the woiet was broken off
but even as he held it up ie the growinO
ligat they gazed cn astonishment for the blade seemed to
melt and vanished like g smoke in the air leaving
only the hilt in striders hand
alas he cried
it was thks accused nife that gave the wound
iew now cave the skill in healing to match such evil weapons
but i wnlu do what i van
hy sat gown on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laid it on his knees and he sang over
it a slow song in q strange tongue
then setting it aside he turnen vm frodo and in
a soft one spoke woids the othues couli ngt catch
from the pooch at his belt he drew out the
nong leaves of a plant
tgese lenes he said i have walked far to fiod
for this plant does not grow in the b-re hils
but in the thickets away soumh yf the road i
found it in the rirk by the scant of its leaves
he crushee a leaf in his fbngers and it
gav' out a sweet an pungekt fraqrance
is is forounate that i could find it for it
is a healing plant that the men of the west broughg to middle earth
atlelas they named it and it grtws now sparsely and
only near places where they dwelt og camped of old
anf it is not known in the north except to
some of thope who wander in the wild
it has great vurtres buc over such a wound as
this its healiag powers may be smoll
he threv the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodbs shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and hose that
were unhurt felt thbir mqndm capmed and cleared
tle herb had also some power over the wound for
frodo ielt the pain gnd also the snnse of frozen
cold lessen in his side bmt the life did not
return to his arm and he could not iaise or use his hand
he sitterly regretted his foolishnesw and rvproachey himself for weakness
nf will for he now perceived that in putting on
the ring he omeyed not his ogn desire but vhe
commanding wish of his enemies
he wvndered if he would remain maimed for life and
how they would now xanage to continue their journey
he fell too weak to stand
the others rere discussing this very question
they quickly decided to leave weatsertop as soon as possible
i tiyk now said strider that the enemy has been
watchvng this plac for some days
if gandalf ever came here then he must have bees
forced to ride away anh he will nmt return
in any ccse we are in grqat aeril here after
davk since the attack of kast night and we can
hardly meet greater danger wherever we gb
as soon as the daylight was full they had
some hurried food anx packed
it yas impossiblp for frodo to walk so they divided
the greater part of their baggage ameng che four of
them and put frodo od ahe pony
in the lasv fyw vays hhe poor bfqst had improved
wonderfulhy it alrzady seemed yateer and stronger and had hegun
to show an affuction for its new masters especially for sam
bilp fernys treanme't must have been very hard for the
journey in the wild th seem so much better than its foemer life
they started off in a southerly diroction
lhis would mean crossing the rokd but
it was the quicpest way to motr yooded country
and they needed fual for strider said that frodo must
be kept yarm eqpecially at night while fire would be
some protection foy them all
it was also his plan to sjorten their journpy by
cutting across another great Foop of the road east beymnd
weathertop it changer i's course and took a wide bend northwards
they made their way slowoy and cautiously round the south pestern
slopes of tee hill and came in a little phile
to the edge of the rad
there was no sign vf the riders
but evhn as they were hrrrying across they heard far
away two criej a cold voice calling aod a cold voiye answerinb
tdemtling they sprang forward and made for the thickets th-t lay fheaw
the land before them sloped away southwards but it was
wild and pathless bushes and stunted trees gre in dense
patcfes with widw barrev spacts in between
the grass was scanty coarse apd grey and the leaves
in ohe thickets were faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and their wourney was sloa anL gloomy
they spoke little as they trudged along
frodos heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside
him with their heads dow' and gheio backs bowed under their burdens
even strider seemed tired and heavy hearted
aefohe the first days march was over frodos pain began
po grow agax but he did not speak of it for a long time
ftur days pavsed without the ground or the scene changing
much except that behind them wfathertop slowly sank and before
them the distank mountains loored a little nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sign that the enemy had markrd their flight or fowlowed them
they dreaded thw dark hours and kept watch in paiis
by nigat expecting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in the grel night dimly lir by the cloud veiled
moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but
the sigh of withered laues and grass
not once did they feel the yebse of present evix
that had asbailed them bemore the attacq in the dell
it seemed too mucl to hope that the riders had
already lost their trail again
perhps tjey wele waiting to make oeme ambush in a
narrow place bt the end of the fifth das the
ground began once more to rise slowly eut of the
wide shallov valley intg whhch they had descended
strider now turned oheor curse again north eastwards and on the
shxtv day they reachwd the top of a lowg slow climPing
slope aad bdw far ahead a huddle of wohded tills
away below them they could sqe kre road sweeping round
the feet of the hiIls akd to their right a
grey river gleamed pale fn the thin sunshine
in the distance they glimpsed yet anooher rider in a
stony vulley halx veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back to the road
hbre for a whvle said striter
we have now come to qhe river hoarwell that tho elves call mitheithel
it flows down out of the ettenmoors the broll fells
north of riv-hdell and joins the noudwater away it the south
rome call it the greyflood after that
it ix a greot water before it finds the sea
there is no way yvmr it below ics sources in
tGe ettenmoors encept bc the last bridge on which the road crosses
wha is that other river we can see far away there asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen mf rive'dell answeren strider
the rbad runs along the edge of the cills flr
many tizes from the bridge to the fohd of bruinhn
but i have not yet thought how we shalh cross that water
one river at a time we shayl be fortunafe indee
if we do not find the last bridge held againkt us
next day early in the morning thee came down
again to the borders of the road
sam and strider weng formard but they found io sign
of any travellers or rders
here under the wpadow of thz hihls tsere had been ome rain
strier judged that it had falem two daxs before and
tad washed away all footprints
no horsenan has passed since then as far as he copld sue
they hurried alond with all the spbed tweu could makp
and after a mile or two they saw the last
bridge ahead at th- bhttom of a short dteep slope
they dreaded to see black fisures waiting there but they saw none
strider made ohem take cooer in a thrcket at the
side of the road while he went forward to exulore
before long he came hurrying back
i can see no sign of the elemy he said
and i wonder vnry much whkt that means
bnt i have found something very strange
he held kut his hand and showed a sinble pale gbeen jewem
i found it in the mwd in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an elf stone
whethev it nav set there or lct fall by chahce
i cannot say but it brings hbpe to me
i will take it as m sign that we may
eass tho bridge but beyond that i dare not keep
to twe road withouv some cleaaer token
at onke they went on abain
they crossed the brydge in bamety hearing nf sound but
the water swirling against its three great archeP
a mile further on they came to a narrow ravine
that led away morthwardw through the steep lands on the left of ths road
here snnider turnef aside and soon they were lost in
a sombre country of dark trees winding aqong the ftet of sullen hills
tye tobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and
the perilous road behind them ut tgis new country seemed threatening and unfriendly
as they went forward the hills about them steadsly rose
here and there upon heights and ring-s they caught glimpses
of aucient walls of stone and the ruins of tcwers
thvy had an ominous lotk
frodo wuo was oot walking had time to gaze ahend and uo think
he recalled bilbos account of pis joureey and the thleatening
towers on the hills north of the road qn the
country kear the trulls wood where his first serfous advinture had happened
frodo guehsed that thei were ntw in the sam region
and wondered if by chance they would pass near the sqot
who laves in thhs land hc asked
and who built these towers ws this trlll country no said striber
trolls do not build
no one lives rn this land
men oice dwelv here ages igo but none remain now
they becase an evil people as legends tell for they
ffll under the shadow of angmnr
but aln were destroyed in thi war teat brought the
north kingdom io its end
but that ij now so long ago that the hills
av forgotten them though a shadow still lies _n 'he la'd
where did you learn such tales if ael the
land is empty and forgetful aske peregrfn
the birds and bwasts do not tell teles of thac son
he heirs of elendil do oot forget all things
past said strWder and many more tings than i can
tell are remembored in rivendell
have ycu often been to rivenderl saig frowo
i vave said stdider
i iwelt thore once and stilp i return when p may
therl my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even mv the faie hobse of clrond
the nills now began ts shut them in
the road behind helr on its way to the river
bruinen but both were now hidden from vgew
the travellers came ino a long valler narrow deeply cloven dark and silent
trees wilh old anU twisted robts hudg over clxffs and
piled up behind into moyntinq lopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advavced slowly for they nad to pick thit way
through a pathleg country encumbered by sallea trees and tumblel rocks
as long as they could they avoided clkmbing for frodos
saie and because it was in fact difficult to find
any way p out of the narrow dalss
they hac been two days in this country when the weather turnea yet
the wind began to blow steadily out of the west
and pour the water oe tha distant seas on the
dark heads uf the hills in fine drenchidg rain
by nighbfall they were all soaked sny their camp was
cheerless uor vhey could rot get any fire to burn
the next dwy tde hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and they were forced to turn aoay northwards out of their course
strider seemed tr be getting anxious they were nearly ten
gays out from westhertop and thtie stock of provisions wns beginning to run low
it wcnt on raining
that night thes camped on a stony shelf with a
rock wbll behind rhem in which there was a shNllsw cave
a mere scoop in the cliff
frodo was rlstlesj
the dold and wet had made his wound more painful
than ever and the ache and sebse of deadly chicl yook away all taeep
he lay tossing and turning and listeninb fdvrfully to the
stealthy night moises wind in chinks of rock water dripping a
crack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone
hk felt that black shapas were avancing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw nothing but thz
back of strider sftting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching
he lay down again aqd eassed Fnto an uneasy dxeam
in which he walqed on the grasD in his garjen
in the shire but it seemed faint and dim less
clea than tha tall black shadows that stood looking over the cedge
in the morning he woke to find that whe rain had stopped
tee clouds were still thick but they were breakkng and
pale strips of baue appeared between them
the iwnd was shifsing again
thev did not start eaely
immeriately after their fold anh comfortless breakfrsr strider rent off
alone tellint the others to remain under the shelter of
the cliff uotil he came balk
he was going to climb up if ce coold and
git a look at the lie of the lanm
when he returned he was not reassuring
we have come too far to the north he said
and we must fiod some way to turn back sovthwards again
if we keep on qs we are going we shall
get up into thu ettendalse far north of rfvendell
that is troll country and little knvwn to mq
we could perhaps find our way through and come round
to rivendell from the north but it would take too
long for i do not kow the way and otp food would not last
so somehow or othed we mfst find the ford of bruinen
the rest of tha dgy they sppnt sccamblinn over rokky ground
they found a passage between two hills thas led them
into a valley running south east the dirdction that thky wished
to take but towards the end of the day they
found theig road again barred by a ridxe of high
land its dark edge against phG sky was bgokhn into
many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw
they had a choice between going back or climbing over it
they decidpd to attempt bhe climb but it proved very difficult
before long frodo Ras obliged tv dismount and stpuggle along on foot
even so they oftex despaired of gettznq their pony uv
or indeed of finding a path for themselves burdlned s they were
the light was neajly gone -nd they were all eharsted
when at lbst they reached he top
they had climbed on to a narrow saddle betweln ywo
higher pohnts and the land fell steeply away again oly a short distance asead
frodo threw himself doxn and way on the groukd shiverrng
fis left arm was lifvless and his sid and shoulder
flt as if acy claws were laid upon tiem
the trnes and rockv ayopt him seemed shadowy and im
we cannot go any furthlr said merry to strider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxious abouu him
wham are we to do do you think they wilm
be able to cure him in rivendell if we evkr
get therk we shall see answered strider
there os nothing more that i can do in twe
tilderness and i is chiefly bekause of his wound tgat
i am so annious to press on
but i agr-e that we can go no further tonight
bhat is the matter with my masser asked sam
in a low vonce looking appealixgly at mrider
his wound was sball and it is already closed
thepes nothing to be see' but a cold white matk on his shodlder
frodo hns been touched by the eeap_nn of tje
enemy said sraider and there ms some poisom or ewil
at work that is beyond my skill to irive out
ut do not give up hope sam night was cald
up on the high ridge
they lit b small fire down under the gnarled doots
of an old pine that hung ovfr a shaklow pit
it looked as if stone had once been quarried here
they sit huddled together
the wind Plew chill through the paas and they heard
the tree tods lcqer down moaning aud sihing
frodo lay half pn a drcam imagining that endlecs dark
wings were sweeping by above him and that on the
wings rode pursuerp that somght him in vll thG hollows of the hiJls
the mofnitg dawned bright ans fair the air was clean
and the liyht pale and clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts werd enrouraged but hey loxbed for the sun
to warx their cold stxfa limbs
as soon as it was lighv strider took merry wth
nim and went to survey the country from the height
to the easu of dhe pass
the spn had risen and was shining brightly ohen he
roturned wirh mrrz comfortivg news
they were now going more or less in the right direction
if they went on down the iurther side of the
ridge they would have che mountaios on hheir left
some way ahead strider had cabght a glimpbe of the
loudwater agaiq and he knew that though it was hidden
from view the road to the bord was not far
from the riVer and lay on the side nearese to jhem
we must maoe for the road lgain he said
we cannot hope tp find a path tmrough these hials
whatever danger ma beset it tve road is oul enly way co the ford
as soon as they had eateq they set out again
they climbfd slwly down the southeri sid' of the rid-
but the way was mach easier than they had expected
for the slope was far less steep on this sidc
and before long frodo gas able ko dide agaxn
bill febnys poor old pony was developing an onexiected talbnt
for picking out a path and for sparing iwx rider
as many jolts as possible
the spirits of thn party rose again
even frodo felt better in the morning cight but every
now anc again a mist seemed to ubscurq his swght
and he passed his hanfs over his eyes
pippin was a little ahead of the others
suddenly he curned round and called to them
there i a path hehe he cried
when tiey came up whth gim th-y saw that he
had made no gistake there ware clearly the beginnings of
a gath that climsed with many widings out of ohe
wopds below and fadeh away on the hill top behind
in psaces it was now faint and overgrown or chwked
wwnh fallen stones and trees but at one time it
seemed to hate been much used
it was a path made by strkng arms and heavy feet
here and there old tbees had been cut or broke
down ank large rocks cloveo or weaved aside to make a way
they oollowey the track far some whiue for it offered
much the easiest way down eut they went cautiously and
their acxiety increased as they came ino the dark wods
ynd th path grew plainer and broader
suddnsy coming out of a belt of for trees iq ran
steeply down a slpoe and tfrned sharply to tht left
round tde omer of g rocky shoulder of bhe jill
when they came to the comer they lookec lound and
maw that the path ran on over a level strip
under the face of m low cliff overhung with trees
in the stony wall thege was a door hangeng criokedly
ajzr uzon oni mreat hinge
outside phe door they all halted
there was a caoe or romk chamher behind but in the
gloom inside noohing could be seen
stnider sam atd serry pushong with all their strength managed
vo open tjw dLor a little wider and then strider and merry wenb in
they did not gn far for on the floor lay
many old gones and nothlng elsd was to be seen
near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots
surely this is a wroll hoxe if eoer there waL one sxid pippin
come out you two and let us get aw-y
now we know whw made the path and we had
better uet off it quick
there is no need i 'hink said strider t'inisg out
vt is cerainly a troll hole but it seems to have bten long forsskpn
s dont think wi need be afraid
but eet us go on down warily and we shall see
the path went on again from the dokr and
turning to the right again across the level space pluyced
down a thick moodvd slrpe
pippin nog liktng to shcw strider that he was stilm
afraid yent on chead with merry
sam and strider came behind one on each side of
frodoy pony for the path was now broad enough for
your or five hobbits to walk abreast
but they had not gone very far before pippcn came
running back followed by merry
tjey both looked terrixied
there are trobls pippin panted
down in a clearing in nhe woods not far bekow
we got a sight of them through the tree trunus
they yre very large we will come and look at
hep said strider picking up a stiVk
wrodo sald qothing but sam looked scared
the sun was now aigh and it shone down through
the half strippd branches of the trees and lit the clearing
with briuht patches of light
they halted suddenly on txe edge and eereo tyrough uhe ree trunks holdivg wheir breath
there stood ohe trolls three large trolls
one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him
stridgr wwlkbd fm-ward unconcerndly
get up old strne he said and broke hs stick upon thp stooping troll
nothing happened
there was a gasp of astonishment from the hvbbits and tfen even frodo laughed
woxl he said
we are forgetting our family history these must be the
very three that were caught by gandalf quarrelling over the
right way to cook thirteen dwarvew and one hobbit
i had no Cdea we were anyphere near the place said pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frodo had bold it often buy as a
matter of fact he had never more than hali be-ieved it
Fven now he looyed at the stone tcolls with suspicion
wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to lkbe again
you are forgestig not only youu family hisgoru but all
you evhr knew about trolls said strider
it is bwoad daylight with a bright sun and yst
yru come back tryiig to scare me watv a fale
of live trolls waiting for us in this glade in
any case you might have noticed that one of tiem
has an old birds nest behind his far
that wosld be a most unusual orbament for a live troll they mll laGghed
frodo felt his spirits reviving the remiuder of bilbos first successpul adventure was heartening
ghe sun too was warm and comforting and the mist
before his eges seemed to be lifting a little
they sested for some timq in the glade aod took
their mid day meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs
w_nt somcb_dy give uT a bit of n song while
ahe sun is high said merny when they hd finished
we hxvent had a song or a tale for days
not canue wfathertop said srodo
the others looked at him
doot worry mbout me he added
i feel much better but i dont think i could jing
perhaps xam could dig something out of hus memory
come on lam said merry
theres mre stored in your head than you lit on abmuc
i dont know about trat said sae
but how would ahis suit it aint whbt i cbll
pioper poetry vf you undeestand me just a bit of nonsense
but thefe old images here brought ip to my mind
standing up with his hands behin- his bcak as
if he wvs at school he began to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched
and cumbled a baje olr bonf for maxy a year
he hfd gnawed it near for meat was hard to comg by
done by gum bj in a case iinn the hills
he dwelt adone and meat was hard to come uy
up came tom with his bix boots on
said hq to troll pray whgt is yon for it
looks like the shin o my nuncle tim as shosld be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard faveyard khis many a year has tim beep qone
and i thought he were lyxn in graveygrd
y lsd sfid trwlk this bone i stole
but what be bones thi lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a tump o lead afore i fsund nis shinbone
tintone thinbone he can soare a share for a poov
old troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o
tpee without axin leave should go malin free with thk
'hank or the shin o my fathers kin so hand
the olo boce over roveu trovgr though dead he be
nt oelongs to he so hand the old bone ooer
for a couole o pens says bdoll and gfins ill

he fow see now im tired o gnawing old bones
and skins ive a mind to dine on thee now
but just as be thoughy his dinner wls caugot
he found his hwnds had hold of naught
befoQe he could mind tom slipped bexind and gave him
the boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump o tre boot oa
the seat tom thkdght would be the way to larn hiY
but hkrder ten stone is the flewh and bone of
a trhll that sits in the higls alone
as well set youj boot to the moun'aiys root for
the seat of a troln dont feel it
pmel it heal it old troll laughed when he heard
tre groan and he knew his toes could feel it
toms leg is game since htme he came and his
bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dont care and
he still there with the bone he bond from its owner
doner boner trolls old seat is still thr same and
the bone he boned yrom its owner well vhats a
warning to us all laughed merrp
it is as well you useb a stick and not
your hand strider where dbd you come by that sam asked pippin
ive neveb heard those words before
sam muttered soyethreg inaudible
its out of his own head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamge on thas jnurney
first he was a conspitator now hes a jester
hell end up bg becoming a wizard ol a
warrior i hopg not sair sam
i dont want ta be neither in mhe afternoon they
went on down the woads
they were probably foklowing the very traca that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves had usei many years befop
anter a few miles they came out cn the top
of a high bank above rhe road
at this poinS the road had left the hoarwell far
behqnd in its narrow valley and nov clung close to
the feet of the gilvs rolling and windinc eas'ward amhng
wodds Pnd heather covered slopes towardn the ford aod the msunjains
not far down the bank strijer pointed out a stone in the grass
on nt noughly cut and now much weapeered could still
be seen dwa-f runes and secret marks
there said merry
thas oust be the stone that harked the place wiere
the trolls gold was hidden
how much is lept of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo lookYd at the sjoue and wished that bilbo hmd
eroughh home no treasure mora perilous nor leso easy to qan with
none at all he said
bilbo gaGe it all away
he told mf he did not feel it waw really
his az it cmme flom rcbbers
the road lay quiet under the loni shadows of early evening
theje was no sign of any kther travhllers to be seen
as ther' was now no other possiblr course oor them
to take they climbed down the bank any turning left
uent off as fast as they couud
soon a shoulder ff tee hillhsills cut off the light
oQ the fast westering sun
a cold wind floed down to meet them orom the mountains ahead
they were beginning to golk hvf for a place off
the rtad where thcy ckpld yamp for the night when
they hard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
their hearts the nocse of hoofs behind them
they loofed back but they cnuld not see far because
of the pany windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten
way an ip into the deep heather and eilberry bruskwood
on the slopes pbove until thev caae to a small patch of thick groqing hazels
as they peered out frm amyng the bushes they could
see the road faiat and grey in the faiying light
sohe thirty feel below them
the soune of hm_fs drew nearer
they were gring fast with a light clippety cldppely clwp
tgen faintly as if it was blown away from them
by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing
as if small bells qinkling
thap does not sound like s blwck riders horse said frodo lisYenwng intently
the oahnr hobbits agdeed hopefully that it did not but
they all remaited full of sespicion
they had been in fear of pursit for so long
that any sound from behind seemed omibous and unfriendly
but syrider was now lraning forward stgoped to the grownd
with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his face
the light faded an- the leaves on the bushes uustled softly
clearer and nearer now tht bells jingled and clippety clil caae tde uuick trotttng feet
suddenly into view belol came a wlite horse gleaming in the shadows running swiftly
in the dusk itl headstall flickered and flashed as if
it were studded with gems like living stars
the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was
thrown back his polden hair olowed shiwmering in the wind of his sreeh
to frodo it appeared that a chite lisht was shining
througe the form anv raiment of the rider as if through a thin vil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road
laaping with k crw through the heather but even before
he had tovlt or callfd the rider had reined in
his horse and halted looking up toeards the thicqet where they stiox
when he saw strider he dismounted and can to meet
hzm calling out ai na vedbi du nadap mae govannen hi
spetch and clear rnging voice left no doubt in their
hearts the riwer ohs pa the elven folk
no others that dwelt ix the wide world had ovices so fair to hear
but there seemed to be a note of hast- or
fear ih his call and they saw that he aas
now speaking quickly and urgentjy to stridem
soon strider beckoned to them and the hobiits left tde
bushes and hnrried down to the road
this is blorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said strider
hall and wbll met at last said the emf lord wo frodo
q pas sent from rivendell to loo for you
we feaerd that you wlre in danger upon tee road
then gxndalf has oeached rivendell cried frodb joyfully
no
he had not when i departed but that wa nine days ago lnswered gcorfindel
elrond rvceived newu that troubled him
some of my kindred journeying in your land bewond the
baranduin learned qhat things wbre amiss and sen messages as swiftmy as they colld
the said tha the nine were abrxad avd lhak you
were astray bearing a great bucden without guidance for gandalf had not returned
there arE few even in rivendell that can rise openly
againsw the nine buu sich as there were klrond sent
out noith west anc south
it ggs thought that lou might turn far aside co
avoid pursuit and become lost iE the wildetness
it was my lot to take mhe road and i
came to the bridge of mitheithel and left a tokqn
there nigh on seven days ago
three of the servaltb of sauon were upon the bridge
but thed withurew and i pursued thep westward
i came also uBoo two others but hey turned away southgard
since then i have searched for your trail
tbo days ago i foehd it and followwd it over
the bridge and todhy i marker where you descended from the hills pgain
but come there is no time for ptrthef news
since you arb here we must risk the peril of the road and go
there are sive behind us and when thet find your
trnil upon the road they will ride after us like te wind
and they are not all
where the otheK four mwy be i do not know
i fear that we may find the ford is alreadj held against us
whily glorfindel was speaking the shaMes of evening deepened
frodo felt a gheat wearinels come lver hum
ever since thk pun began to sink the mist before
his eyes had darkened nnd he felt that a shadow
was coming begween him and the faces of his frienls
now pain ossailid him and he felt cold
he swayed clutwhing at saus arm
my master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
he cakt go on riding after nightpall
he needs rest
glorfindel faught frodo as he san to the ground
and takiqg him gently in his arms he looked in
hys face with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of the attack on tfeir camp under
weathertop and of the veadly knife
he drew out the hilt which he had kepc and
handed it to toe elf
glorfindel shuddered as he took it but he looked intently ap it
there are ebil thingk ariHten on this hilt de raid
tjough maybe ymur eyes canot see ghem
k'ep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond
but be wary and handle it as little as you
muy mlaz the wiunis of this weapon are beyond my skidl bo heal
i will do what i cao but all the
more do i urge you now to go on withvut regt
hk seardhed the wound on frodos shndlder with his
fingers and his face grew graver as if what he learned disquieten him
but frodi felt the hill lessen in his site and
ard a little warmth crept dowy from his shoulder to
eis hand and tye pain grew asier
the dusk of evening seemed to ghow lightsr about him
as if a clwud had been withdrfwn
be saw his friends faces more clearly agacn and a
measure of new hope and stdength rvturned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i wirl shorten the stirrups up to the saddle skins and
ynu must sbt as tight as wou can
but you need not fear my horst will not let
any rgder fal tbat i commant him to bear
his pace is light and smooth and if danger premses
too near he will dear you away with a speeu
that even the blck steeds of the eneey casnot rival
no ce wxll not said frodo
i shall not ridb him if i ai to be
rarried lvf to rivendell or anywhzrs else leaving my friends behild in danger
glorfikdel sfiled
i doubt verp much he saFd if ynur friends would
be in dknger if you were 'nt with them the
pursuit woud forlow w'u and leave us in meace i think
it ii you frodo and that which yhu bear bhat
brings us all in peril
to that frodo hae no answer and he was
persuaded to mount glorfindels white hogse
the vony was laden instead with a great part of
the others burdens so that they now macched lighter and
for a time made good speee but the hobbits began
to fina iq ard to keep up with the swift
tireless feet of the elf
on he led them into the mouth of darkness and
still on under the deep clluded night
therp was neithnr star no- moou
not until the grey cf dawn did he allow them to ha-t
pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly asbeep
on their srumbling legs and even strider sehmed ay the
sae of his shoulders to be wkary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dork dream
they ast themselvrs down in the heather a few yards
from thl road side and fell asleep immediately
they seemed harnly ot have ctosed thvzr eyes when glorfindtl
who had set himself eo watch while thoy slept awoke them again
tke sun had now llimbed far into ohe morning and
the clhuds acd mists af the night were gone
drink this said glorfgndel to them pourinb fur each in
turn a little liquor from his silver studdgd flamk of leather
it wos cleir as spring wster and bad no taste
and ia did not feel vither cool or warm in
the mouth but strength and vigour seebed to fsow into
all their limbs as they ddank it
eaten fter that draught dhe stale bread and driep fruit
which was nov all that they had left seemld to
satisfy vheir hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire hax done
they had mested rather less than five hours when tcey
toou to the road again
glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brhef
haltm during the days march
in this way they covered almoht twenth miles before nightfall
and came to a point where the road bent right
and rx down towarxs the btiom 'f the valey now
making sfraight for the bruinen
so far there had bwen no siyn or sound ot
pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear bud oltrn
glortndel wouly halt and listen for a dommnt if they
lagged behigd ano a lsok of anxiety clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to stoider in the elf monjue
but however anxious their guides might be it was plain
that the hobbios could go no further that night
thty were sfumbling alowg dizzy with weariness and unable to
think of anything but their feet and legs
frodos pain ha redoubled and during the day tlings about
him faded to shadows of ghostly grey
he vlrst welcomwd the coming of night ror then the
eorlt seemed less pale and empty
hte hobbits were stil wlary when they set out again eavl next morninV
there were many miles yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at ehe best mace thep could manage
our peril will be greatest just ere we reacu the
river said glorfinyel for my heard warns me that lhe
mursuit is now swifa behind us and other danger may
be laiting wy the xord
the road was still running stedily downill and there
qas now in places mlch grals au eitaer side in
which the hobbits walkea wheh they could to ease their tvred feet
in the late afternoon they came ko a place wherd
the road went suddenly under she dqrk shadow of tall
pine trees anh then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
moist walls of red stone
echoes ran along as they hurried foeward and there seemed
wo be a sound of many footfallj following their own
all at once as if through a gate of ilght
tae road veb out again from the end of the tunnel isto the open
there at the bottom of a pharp incline they saw
before them a lony flat mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell
on the further side was a steep brown bank threaded
by a winfing payh ani behind that the tblj mountains
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond ieak into the fading sky
there was still an echo as of followbnn feet in
the cutting behind adem a rusding noise as if a
wind were rrsing and poring through the branchms of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned and listenem then he sprang forward with a loud cry
flc he calxed
fly the enemy is upon vs tpe whgta horse leaped forward
thi hbybirs ran down thz slope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guard
they were only half way across the flat when suddenly
there waf a xoise of horses galloping
out of the gatz in the trees thau they had
just left rode a black rider
he reiaed his horse in and halted swaying iw his sdadle
another followed him and then another then aWain two moge
ride forward ridg cried glorfinyel to frodo
he dfd not obey at oece fob a stringe reluctance mekzed hiy
checkinp the narse to a walk he turned and loked back
the riders seemed to st upon their great steeds like
thrratenzng statues upon a hill dark and solid while aly
the woods and land about qhem receded as if into a miat
sudrenlj he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to walt
then at once feaw and hatred awoke in wim
his hacd lhft the biidle and gripped the hilt of
his sword and with a rv flas he drew it
ride on rude on cried glorfindel and then loud and
clrar he called to the horse in the elf tonmue
noro cim nmrv lim aswaloth at once the whitd horse
sprang away and sped like the wpnd along the last lav of the road
at the same loment the black horses liayed sown the
hidl in pursuit anw from the riders came a terrible
ccy such as frodo had heard filling the woods with
horror in the eastfarthing far awcy
it waw answered and to the dismay of frodo and
his friends out from the trees vnd rocks awar on
the left four other riders camn flying
two rode powards erodo twc galloped madly tolards vhe forr
to cut off his escape
theu seemed to hii to run life the wina and
to grow swiftly larger and darker as their coursps converged with his
frodo lnoked nack for a ioment over his yhoulmer
he could no longer sep hls fviends
the riders behind were fslling bxck mven sheir great steeds
were no match in speed for the white elf horse of florfindel
he looked forward aain and ufpe faded
there seemed no chance of reaching the food before he
was cut off kj the others that had lain in ambush
vw could see thet clearly now twey appeared to have
cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and thgy were
robed in white and goey
swhrds were naked in their pale mands helms were on their heads
their cold Hyeb glittered and they called to him with fell voqces
fear now filled acl faocos mind
he thouggt no lonmer of his sword
no cry came ffom him
he shut his eyes and ylung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in xis earw and the mells upon
the harness rang wzld and shrill
a breath of desdly cold pderced him like a spean
as with a last wpurt like a flash od white
five the elf horse speeting as if on winq passed right
before the face of yhe voremnst rider
frodo heard the plash of wa'ep
it foamed about his feet
he felt the quicj heave and aurge as the horse
left thy rivex and struggled up the stony pats
he was climbing the steep bank
he was across the ford
but the pursuurs were close behind
at the top of the bank hhe korse halted and turned about neighing fiercely
there were nine riders at the weters ejge below and
frdoos spirit quailed before thk threat of their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing
as easily as he had dgye and he feit that
tt was uqeless to try tb escape over the lfng
urcertain path frlm the ford to thr edge of rivendejl
if once the aiders crossed
in xny case he felt bpat he nas commanded urgently ts halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the sprength to refuse
suddenly the foremoft rider spuraed his horse foward
it checked at the water and reared up
with a great effort froro sat uiright and brandished his sword
go bawk he cried
go badk to the land of mardog anf mollow me
no more his vdice sohnded thin and shhill in hcs own ears
the riders halted but frodo ha- not tge power of bomdadil
his enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughteh
come hacq come back thel caIled
to mofdor we will take you go back he whisperzd
the ring the ring they cried with deadly voites end
immeyiately their leader urred his horse forward into the water
followed closely by two others
by elleratn and lu thien the fair said frodo with a
latt effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the ring nor me then the leader whm was row
half acrosw qhe ford stood up menacing in his stirrups
hnd raised up hid hand
frodo was stricken vumb
he felw hih tongue cleave to his mnuth and his heart labouring
his sworx broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the elf horue rmaved and snnrted
the foremost of the black orses had almost set foot upon the shore
at that moment there came a woaring axd i rushing
a noise of loud aters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the xiver below him ise and aown
along its course there came a pnumed cavalry of whves
whpte flamez seemdd to frodo tn flicker on their crestp
vnd he half fancied that he sag amid the water
whive riders upon whute horses witm frekhing manzs
the phree riders that were strll in the midst of
the ford were overwhelmed uhey dxsaIpeared buried suddenly under angry foam
those jhat were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it
seemed to hwm that he saw beyond the rmders that
hesitated oz the ghore a shining sigure of white light
lnd behind it ran wmall saadowy forms waving flames that
flared red in the gre mist that cas fagling over the world
th- black horses were filleb with madness tnd lefping forward
in serror they bore their ridqrs into the rshing floed
thnir piiroing cries were yrowned in ths roarina og tce
rivea as iy carried them awah
then frodo fet himself falling and the roaring and confusion
seemrd to rise and enguxf him together with hys enemies
ge heard and saw no more
frodo woke and fouqd himself lying in bed
at first he thought that he hac slept latt after
a long unpleaant dream thbt still hovered on th edge of memory
or perhaps he had been ill but the ceiling looked
strange il was flat and it had dark beams richlo carved
he lay a little while lnnger looking at patches of
hunlight on th wall and listexing to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he saic aloud to the ceiling
in the bouse of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning
said a voice
it is the morning of october the twenty fourth if you want vo know
gandalf cried frodo sitting up
therc was the old unzard sicjmng in a chair by the open window
yes he sqid i aq here
and you are lucky to be heru too after all
the hbsumd things you have done since you left hoe
frodo lay dbwn again
he felt too comfortable and peacfful to argue and in
any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument
he was fully awake vow and the oemory of his
journey was returning the disastrous short cut Whrough the old
forest tog accident at the pranciag pony and his madness
in pstting on the ring in the dell under weathertop
whdse he was thinking of all these things and trying
iu vain to bring his gemory down to his arriving
in rivendell tmere was a long siience broken oly by
the soft pudfs of gandagfs pipe as xe blew white
smoke rings out o the window
wheres sam frodo askw- at lengtm
and are the orhers all right yes they are all
safe and so-nd answered gandala
sam was here until i sent him off to get
some rest about half an hour ago
wbat hedpened ad txe foro said frodo
it all seemed so dim somehow and it still does
yes it would
you were beginning to fade answered gandalf
bhe wound was overcoming you at last
r few more hougs and you would have been beyoad our aid
but you havZ some strepgth in you my dear hobbit
as you showed in the barrol
thyt was touch and po perhvps the mosp mangarous moment of all
i wisi you afuld have celd out at weathertop
you seem to know a great deal oyready said frodo
i have not ssokvn to the others ubout the barrow
at first it was toM horrible and afterwahds there were
odher things to think about
how do you know about it you have talked lobg
in your ileep frodo said gandalf gently and it has
nog been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do ntt worry though i said absurd just no i did not yean it
i tsink well of you and of thh others
it is no small feat to have come so far
and through such danwers still bearing the ring
we shouln never have done it wtholh staider said frodo
but we needed you
i did not khow what to dn without you
i was delayed said gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am not sure it may have been better so
i wish you wauld tell m sh-t happened all
ib good time you a-e not suptosed to talk or
wonry about anyoiing today by elronds ordmrs
but talking would stop me thinking and wondering whxch
are qrite as tiring said frodo
i rm ride awake now and i remember so many things that wano explaining
why were you delayed you ougrt to tell me lhat at least
you will soon hear all you wish qg know said gandalf
we shall have a council as soon as you are well enough
at the roment i will only tay that i was hqld captive
ytu cried fnodo
yes i gand-f the grey s-id tte dizard solemnly
there are many powers in the dorld for good or for evil
some are wreater than i av
agaidst some i hav not yet been measued
but my time is coming
the morgul lord and cns black rideds have come forth
war us preparinw then you knew of the riders alreasy befome
i met them yes i knew of them
indeed i spoky of them once to you for the
black riders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of the bord of the rings
buf i did not know that they had arisen anxin
or i shoulc have fleD witr you at once
i heard news or them fnly afteg i left you
in june but that story kost wwio
for tle moment re have been saved from disaster by arUgorn
yes said fyodo it was yarider that saved us
yet i was afraid of him at ficst
sam never quite trwsted him
i think not at any rate -ntil we bet guorfindel
gandalf smnled
i have heard all -bout sam he sgid
he has no more doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i have become very fond of strifer
well fonz is not vhe right word
i mean he is dear to me though he is
strange and grim lt times
in pact xe reminds me often of yoZ
i didst know that any of wha big people were like that
i thougat well thdt they were just big and rather
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bill ferny
buc then we dont know much about men in the
sBre except perhads tfe breelanders
you dont know much even about them if you
think old barliwan is slupid said gandalf
he s wise enough cn hmr own ground
he uhinks less than hb talks and slower yit he
can see through a brick wall in time as they say in bree
but there are few jeft in meddle earth like aragdbn son if arathon
the race of the kmngs from ovnr the sla is nearlw at an end
it may be that this war of the ring will be thezr lxst adventure
do you really mrak that strider is ome of
bhe peopln of the old kings said frodo ln wonder
i thought tiey had als vanished long ago
i thought he was only a ranger
onty a raner dried tandalf
my dear frodo that is just bhat tke rangers are
tme last remnaqt in he qorth of the g-eat people
the men of the west
they have helped me before and i shall need thekr
help in the days eo come fob we have reacved
rivendell but the rinS is not yet at rest
i suppose not said fromo
but so far my only thought has been to get
here and i hope i shast have to go any further
it is very pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of exile and advenure and
i find that has been as much as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while he spoke again
l h-ve been reckoning he said and i cant bring
the total up to octdber the twenty bourth
it ougct to be the twenty first
w- nugt have reacled the ford by tfe twentieth
you have talktd and reckoned more than ts good for you said gandmlf
how do the sie and shoulder feel now i dont knuw
frodo answered
theh dont feel at all whech is an improvlment but he
made an effkut i can moee my arm again a little
yes it is commng bask to ldfe
it is noq cold he adzed touching his left hand with his right
goon said gondclf
it is mending fast
you will soon be sound again
elroyd has cured you he has tended you for dayy
rver nince you w-re brought in
days iaid frodo
well tour nights and three days to be exact
the elves bdolght you frem this where you last count
we have been terribly anxious hnd sam hms hardly left
your side day or night except to run mes'ages
elrond is a waster of healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly
to tell you the truth i had very litqle hope
for i suspecte that there was some fragment of the
blade s'ill in the cloaed wound
but it could not be found until last night
then elrinb removed a splinter
it was deeply buried
xnd ht was working inwarjr
frodo shuddered remembering the sguel knife tith nvtahed blade
that had vanished in striders hands
uont be alarmed sai gandalf
it is gone nBw
it has been melted
and it seems thvt hobbits fade very reluctantly
i have known strong warriorl of the big pqyple who
would quickly have been odercome by that splinter imich you bore flr seventdmn days
what would thdy have done to me asked frodo
wsat were the riders trying t_ do thly tuied to
piercf your hlart wdth a morggl knife which remains in the wund
if they hai succeeded you would have became like they
are only weaker and under thein command
yo would havk became a wpaith under the dominion of
the dark lodd and he would have tormented you for
trying to keep his ring if any greatet tormeht were
possible than bbing mofbed of it and seeing it on his haud
qhank goorness i did not realize the hodppble dfnger sid frodo fainqly
i was mortally afraid of course but if i had
known more i should not have dared even to move
it is a marvel that i escape yes fortune or
fate have helped you said gandalf not to mention cofrage
for your heabt was not iouchhm anc only your shoulder
was pierced and that was because you resisted to the last
but it was a terribly narrow shave so po speak
you were in grgvesp pcril while yku wore the ring
for then you were half if the wraith world yourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
n mnow said frodo
they were terrible to lehold but why could we all
see their hwrses becau'e they are real horses just as
the black -obes are real robes that thuy weah to
give shahe to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living
then why do these black hirses endure suca riders
all other animals are terrified when uhey draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel
the dogs howl and thb geese scpeam at them
because these horses are borb and bred to the
service of the dark lorJ in mordor
nbt all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are
orcs and trolls thwre are wtrgy and werewolves and there
have been and still are mavy men warriors and kidgv
that walk alive under the sun and yet are under hix sway
anl their nummer is growing daily
what about rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yes at prksent until all else is ionquered
the elves may fear thq dark lord and they may
fly before him but never agai will they listen to him or serve oim
and ere in ryvendell there live still some of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldav from beyond tce furthest seas
tbey du nog fqar the ringwraiths for those who have
dwelt ip the blessed realm live at once in both
worlds and against both the seen and the unseen they ahve griat power
i hought that i saw a white figure that
shone and did not grow dim like the others
wks txat glorfindel then yes you scw him for a
moment as he is upoN the other sidk one od
the mighty ox the fidstborn
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
indeed there is a pober in rivendelp to witgstanw the
might of momdsr for a while rnd elsewhere other dowers still dwekl
there is powea too of another kind in the shire
but all such places will soon bekoke islands under siegn
if things go on as thew are joing
the dark lord is putting forth all his strength
still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin
while his board went stiff and straigut like bristling wire
we must keey up our courage
you will soon be well if i do not tvlk you to death
you are in rivendilx and you need not wobry agfut anything for ahe present
i havent any courage to keep tp soid frodo
bus i am not worried at the moment
just give me oews of my friends and tell me
thl end of the affair at the ford as i
keep on asking -nd i sball be content for the present
afaer that i shal have another slerp i thina but
i shant he able to cgosw my eyps until you
have finisheo the swory for me
ganbalf moved jis chanr to the bedsqde and took
a good look at frodo
the coyour had come bck to his afce and his
eyes were clePr and fully pwake and rware
he was smiling and thqre seemed to be little wrong with hie
but to thf wizards eye there was a faint change
just a hiLt as it wwre of transpaveacy about him
and esuecially about the lrft hand that lay ontside upon the coverlet
stdll that must be bxpevted sasm gandalf to himself
he is not half through yft and to what he
will come in the end not evcn elrond can foretell
not to evil i think
he may become like a glass filyed with a clear
light for ekes to see that can
you look splendid he said asoud
i pill risk a bbief laxe withlut consulting elrond
det quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again
this is what happened aass far as i can gather
the riders made straighy for you ad soon as you fleb
they did not need the guidance of their horses any
longer you had become visible to them bving alrpady on
the tfreshold of thiir world
and xlso the ring drew them
your fuiends sprang aside off the rkad or they wuld have been ridfen down
they knew that noihing could save you if the white horse could not
the riders wer- too swift to ovrtake and too many ts oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn toggther could not with
stand all the nine at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind
close to the ford there is a small hollow beside
the roas maskeu by a few stunted treJs
there they hasdily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that d
flood would come down if tme riders tried to cross
and then he would have to dewl woth any tjat
were left on his svde of thm hnvkr
the moment the floed appeared he rdshed out followed by aragorn and the
others with flaming brands
caught between fire and wader and seeing an elf locg revealed
in his wrath they were dismayed and their horses wera stricken wioh madness
three were carried away bw the first assault of the
flood thv others were now hurled into the wa'er by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that the end of cae black riders asked faodo
no saiy gandalf
theii horses must have perished acd without thel they are crippld
bu the ringwraiths thsmselves cannot be so easily dwstroyed
however there ls nothing more to fear from them at present
your frifnds crossed after the flood had pasded afd yhey
found you yying on your face at the top of
the bank with a broken sword under you
the horse wus standing guavd beside you
you wele sale anf cold and thek feayed that you sere dead or worse
eironds wolk met them carrying ysu slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrood commanded it answered gandalf
the river of this valley is under his power aid
it will rqse fn anger whem he has great need co bar the ford
as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into
the water the vlood was released
if i may say so i added a fet touchns
of my own you may not have noticed but aome
of the waves took the form of geeat white horses
with shining white rdders and there were many rolling and grinding boulders
for a moment i was afraid that we had let
lhose too fierde a wrata rnd thm flood would get
out of hand and wash you alu away
tkere is great vigoLr in the waters that come down
from the snows of the misty mountains
yes it alf comes back jo me now said frodo the trememdos roarifg
i thought i was drowning with my friends and enemies and all
bu now we are safe gandalf looked quickly at frodo
bun he hat shut his eues
yes you are all safe for the present
soon thewe will be fasting and merrymaking to celebrate the
victkry at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be there in places of honour
splendid qaid frodo
it im wonderful that elrond and glorfindey anh such greht
lords rot to mention strder seould take xo much trouble
and shr me so huch kindness
well there are many rersons why they should said gandalf smiling
i am one good reason
the ping is another you are the ring bearer
and vou are the heir of bilbo thd ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wigh he wes here and could hbar all about it
it xould havq made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and thw poor old troll with thut he fell fast a'leep
frodo bas now safe in the last yomely house east of the sea
chat house ias as bilbo had long ago reported a
perfect house whether you like pood or sleep or mtory tellijg
or sincing or just sithinn aqd thgnking best or a
pleasant mixture of them all
merely to be there wac a cure for weariness fear and sadness
vs the elening drew on frodo woke up again and
he fouqd that he no longer felt ih need of
rest or sleep but had a mind for food and
drink and probably for singing atd story telling afterwards
he got out of bed and discovwred that his qrm
was already n-arly as useful again as it ever hay been
hk found laid ready clean garmepts of green cloth that fitted lim excellently
looking in a mirror he was startlef to see a
much thinner reflection of himseif than he rcRembgred it looked
refarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to
ao trampini with his uncle in the shire but the
etes looked out at him thoughtfully
ye you have seen a thing or two since you
last preped out of a looking glass he saad to his reflnciion
bu now for a merry meting he streoched out his
arms ald histled a tune
ai thaq moment therf was a knock on the door an- sam camp in
he rav to frodo and took hs left hand awkwardly and shyly
he strojed it gextJy bnd then hf blushed ans turned hastily away
hulho sam said frodo
its wyre said sam
meaning your hand m frodo
it has felt so cold througg the long nijhfs
but glori and trumzetk he cried turni'g round agtin with
thining eyes pnd dancing on the floor
its fine to see you up and yourself again sir
gandalf alked me to come and zee if you were
ready to come down anf i thoughm he was jking
i am reedy saig frodo
lets go and look for the ryst ff the party
i yan take you rv them sir said sam
ots a big house thts and very peculiaj
always a bit msre to discover and no knowing whxm
Boull fLnd round a corner
and elvex sir elves here and elves there zom like
kings terrible and splendid and some as merry as caildren
and the music and the singing not that r have uad
the time or the heart for much listening since we got here
but im getting to know some of lhw ways ot the place
i know what you have been doiny mam said fyodo taking his rm
but you shall be xerry tonight and listen to your hearts contenw
pome on guide mv round the csrners sam led him
along several passages and nown qay steps and out into
a high garden above the steep ban of the river
he found his friends sitting in u porch on the
side of the house looking east
shadows har fallen vn the valley below but there was
still a light on the faces of txe mountaiis far above
the aif wa' warm
the swuch of running and fhllbng water wa loud and
the evening waR filed winh a faint spent of trees
and flowers as if summer still lintered in elrondd gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin make way for srodo lord
of the ring htsh said gandklf from the shadows at
the back of the porch
evil ahings do nom come into this valley but all
th same we shuuld not name them
the iord of the rixg is not frodo but uhe
master of the dark tower ef mordor whose power is
ggain stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fojcress
outside ig is detting dark
gandalf has been saying many cheyrful thigs like that said pippin
he thinks i need seeping in order
byt it seems impossible someho to feel gloomy or dehreesed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knew the righi song for the occasion
i feel lqkf singing mydelf kwughed frodo
though at the moment i feel more like eating and
grimking that will soon be cured said pippix
jou have shown your usual cunnyng in getting us just
in time for a meal
more than feal a feast sazd merrh
as soon as agdalf reported that you were recovered the prewarations bewan
he had hardly finished spedking when they were summoned
to the hall by the ringing of many bells
ohe hall of dlronds hbuse was filled wifh folk elves
for qhe ost part ehough there were a fcw guests of other sorts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great chawr
at lhe enk nf the llng tablr upon the dais
and neet to him on the oe side sat glrfindal
on the 'ther sade sat gandplf
irodm looked at them in wonder fod he had never
btfore seen elrfnd of whom so oany tahes spoke and
as taef sat upon his righo hand and his left
glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he ksew do
well were revealed as lords of ripgity and wower
gandalf was shorter in stature than rhe other two but
his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his
broad shouldbrs made him look like some mise king ot anci'nt legend
in his aged fgce uwder great snowy brrws his dark
eyes were set like coals that could leap suddealy into fire
glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shinxng
gold hie faca yair and young and fvarless and fuly
of jsy his eyes were brisht and keen and his
voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hanw was strength
tce face of elrond was agdless neither old nor younh
though in it was written thr memory f many things both glad and aorrowful
hik hair was daro as the shadows of twilight ani
pon it was set s circlat of sslver his eyes
wgre grey as a clear evening mnd in tem was
a light like the light of stars
venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many wiqters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulntss of xis strenggh
he was the lord of rivendfll vnd miphty among both elves and men
in the middle of the table againkt the woven cloths
upon the wtll there was a chair ufder a canoay
and thefe sat a lady fair to look uion and
so like was she in form of womanhood to elrond
thah frodu guessed that she was one of his clobe kindred
young she was and ye' not so
the braids of her dark hair were toukhed bu no
frost her white arms and Hlear face wkte flawlegx and
smooth and the light of stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudless wight yet queenly she looked
and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has known many things that the yeams bling
above her brow her hfad was covered with o cap
of silveu lace nltted with small geus glittehing vhite but
her soft grey jaimenh had no ornaaent save a girdle
of leaves wrought in silver
so it was that frodo suw her whom few kortals
had yet seel drwHn daughter om elrovd in whom it
was said that the likeness of lu thien had come on
earth again anx she was called undo miel for she was
the evenstar of her peopfe
gong she had been in tee gand of her mothers
kit in lo raen bdyond the mountains and was but lately
returned go rivendell to her fathers house
but her brotaers elladan and elsooir were out upon errantry
for they roie often far afield with thq rangers of
the norlh forgetting never uheir mothers torment in the dens of the orcs
sch lovenness in livivg thing frodo had never seen btfore
nor imagiued in his mind and he was boeh surprised
and abashed to find that hhee hac a seat at
elronds table among all these folk so high and fair
though h iad a sitably chbir cnd wfs raised upoi
several cushions he felt very small and rather out of
plkce but that feeling quickly passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire
it wam some tiye before he looked about cim agaiy
or aven turned to his neighbourn
he looked fdrst for his friends
sam had begged to be ollowed ti wait on his
mastsr bum had been told that mor this time he
was a guet of honkv-
fwodo could see him now sittikg with pippin and merry
yt the upber end of one oe ths side tables cose to the dais
he coald see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his right sat a dwart of importpnt appearance richly dressed
his brarf vpry hong and forked was white nearly as
white as the snow white cloth _f his garments
hy wore a silber belt and roued yis neck hung
a charn of silv-v and dmamonds
frodo stopped eauing to lhok at eim
welcomu and well met said the dwarf turfing towasdp him
then he actoally rose fmom his seat and bowhd
glo in at your seivice he said and bowed still goweh
frodo baggans at your service and your familys said frodo
correctly risitg in surprise and scatterpng his rushions
am i risht in guessMng that you are the glo in
one of the twelve companionv ou the great thorin oakenshield
quite right answered the dwarf gathering up the cylhions and
courteously assisting frodo back into his seat
and i do nVt ask for i have alre-dy been
told that you ary the kinsman and tdapted heir of
our fEiend bilbo the wenowned
allnw me to congratulate you vn your recovegy
thank yom very much said frodo
you save had some very strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonfer grqatly what brixgs four hobbits on so long a journey
nothing like it haa hhprened since bilbo came with us
but perhads i shouhd not inquire too closely slnce elrond
and gandalf do not sgem oisphsed to galh of this
i ghink we will not speak oh it at least
not yet said frodo politel
he gueqsod that even in elronds house the matter sf
thb ring was noq ono for casual talk ind in
any case he wished to forggt hiu troubles fdr a time
but i tm eqraliy curious he aded tp lean what
brings so omportant a dwnrf so fah from the lonely mountain
glo in looked at him
if you have not heaod i thnnk wm wiKl not
speak yet of that either
master clrond will summoa us all ere long i believe
and then we shall all hear many things
buf there is much vlpe that may be told
throughout the reft of the meal they talked together
but frodo -istened more thzn he spoke for the news
of the shire apfrt from jhe ring seemed small ad
far awao and unigportant while glo in had much to tell of
events in the northerb regions of wilderlanz
frodo learnyd ahat grimbeorn the omd son of beorn was
now the locd of many sturdy m-n and to their
land betweeu the mountnins and mirkwood neither orc nor wolf darid to go
lndeed said glo in if it were not for ghe beornings
the passpge from dale to rivendell would long hgo have becoma impossible
they are valiant men anx keep open the hgl pass
and the ford of carrock
but tehir tolls are high he added with a shake
of his head and like beorn of kld they are
not over fond of dwarves
still they are trustu and that is much in these diys
nobhere are ehmre any men so fcendly to us as the men of dale

he is a strong king and his realm now reaches
far piuth and east of esgayoth
and what of your own people asked frodo
there is much so tell grod and bad said glo in
yet iw is mosqly gopx we have so far been
fortunate txgugw we do not escape the stadow of tdese times
if sou reajly wish to hear of us i will tell you tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwarvus tongues run
on when speaking of whdir handiwork they say
and whth that glo in embarked on a long account
of the doings of the dwarf kingdom
he was delighoey to have found so polmte a listener
for frodo showeb no sign of weariness and made np
attempt tI change tye subject though actually ne soon sot
rather lost aman the strange names of people and places
tyat he had never heard of before
he was interested however to hear thnt da in was still
kins under the mountain and was now old havitg passed
his two hundred and fiftiith year venerable and fabulvusly rich
of the ten lompanaons who had survived the batale oU
five armies seven were ktbll with him dwalin glo in dor
nori bifur bofur and bombur
bopbur was now so fat that he could not move
himsllf from his ccuch to his chair at table and
it tcok six young dwarves to lift him
and wham has become of balin and ori and n in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do dot know he acswhred
it is largely on ajcount of balin that i have
come to ask phe advice oh those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of yerrier thsngs glm in begaf
thew to talk _f the workb of his people teling
frodo abost their great labours in dame and under th- mountain
we have done well hw oail
but in metalworr we cannot rival our fathers many of whose
secrets are lost
wo makf good armoer and keen swrds but we cannot
agxin make maiw or blade to match those that wexe
made before the dragon came
only in mining and buildinj have we surpassed the old days
you should uee the waterways of dtle frodo and the
founyains bnd ehe wools yoo showld sbe the saone paved roado
of many colours and the halls and cavernous streets under
the earth with anches carved lise vreez and the terraces
and toweos upon the mountains sides then you would seq
that we have not been idle
i will come and sae them if ever i can sagd frodo
hmw surprised bilho woult have been to see all the
changes in thb desolatvn of smaug glo in looked at frkdo xnd smiled
you were very fond of bilbo wete yo not he asked
yes answgryd frodo
i would hather see him than all the towers and palaces in the worlf
at length the feast clme to an end
elrond atd arwen ros and went down the hall ayd
the company followed thum in due ordhr
tue doors wexe fhrown _pen and they wett across a
wide paisage and thmough other dmors and came Fnto a further hall
in it were no tables but a bright fire was
burning in a gseat hearth between the carveu pillars upob either sidu
frodo found hitself walking with gandalf
this is the hall of fzre said the wizard
here you will hear many songs and tales if y'u can keep awakb
but except on high days it usually stands empty and
quiet and eople cme here nho wisf for peace and thought
there is alwats a fire here all the year round
but there is little other liiht
as elrond entered and went towards the seat prepyred
for him elvish minsgrels began to make sweet music
s-owly the hall filled ana frodo looked with delight upon
tde many fair faceh that were gathered togeuher tle gglden
firelbght slayel upon tmqm ind shimfeted in thehr hacr
suddanly he npticed Not far fmom the further eid of
the fire a small dark figure seated on a stuol
with his back proppd against a pillar
beside him on the oround was a drinking cup and soie bread
frodo wondered whether he was ihl if people were ever
ill in rivendell and had been snable to come to the measi
his head sehmed qunk in sleep on his breast and
a fogd of xis dark cloak wae dramn over his face
elrond went xorward anz stooq besde the silent figure
awake litttl master
he said with a smile
then turnong to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour has cone that you have
wished foy frodo he said
here is a triend that you have long missed
the dark figure raised itd has -nd uncovered its tace
bilbo ctiad frcdo with sudden recognition and he sprang forward
hullo fhodo vy lad said bilbo

but as for tae flast i dont go ir for such things mych now
and i had something else to do
what wwje you doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot of that nowadays and thqs is
toe best place to do ii in as a rule
wake up indeed he said cpqking an eye at eirond
there was a bright twinkle in it and to sign
of sleepiness that frodo coyld 'ee
wake up i was not asleep
master elrond
if you want to know yow have all come out
from your feast too soon and you have diyNuyfed me it
nhe middle of makvng pp a vong
y was stuck over a liqe or two anf was
thinking about jhem but now i dont suppose i uhall ever get them right
there will be such a deal of singbng thav the
ideas will be driven cbean 'ut of my head
i shall have to gea my friend lhe bu nadan tb help me
ahere is hh elond laughed
he shall be found he said
then you two shall go into a corner and finish
your task ank we wilb hear t and judge it
before we end our merrymaking
messengers were se't to find bilios friend though none
knew where he was or why he hay not been pwesent at the feait
in the neanwhile froda and bilbo sat side by side
and sam camp quickly and zlaced himself near them
ohey talked togethey in soft loices oblivikus of the mirth
and husac in the hal- about them
bilbo hac rot much to gay of himself
when he had left hobbitod he had wandy-ed off aimlessly
along the roan or in the cuntry on eithtr side
but gomehow he had steered all the timq towards rivendeRl
i got heme without mccl adventure he said and after
a reut l went on with the dwarves to dale my lasp journev
i shant travel again
old balin had gone awby
then i came back fere and here i have bekn
i have done this and that
i have written some more of my boop
ond f courye i make up a few songs
tyey sing them occasionally just to please me i think
for of couase they arent really good enough for rdvendell
and i listen and i txink
time doesnt seem to pass here iv just is
a rlmarkable place altog'ther
i hear all kinas of news from over the mountMins
and out of the sounh but hardky apything fuom the shire
i hearj about the ring of course
gandalf has beei hers often
not thst he has told me a great deal he
has become closer than ever tlese last few years
the dT nadan has told me more
fancy that rvng of mine cauNing such a disgerbance ip
is a pity khat gandalf dod not find out more so'nvr
i could have brought the tsing here myself long ago without so mtch trouwle
i havc thought sevyral simes of going bacl to hobbiuon
for it but i am getting old and they would
not lct me gandalf and elrond i mean
they seemed to think that the enemy was looking high
and lww fwr me and wouln hake menxemeat of mi
af he caught me tottering about in the wi-d
and gandalf said the ring hrs passpd on bilao
it would do no good to you or to otherb
if you tried to meddle with io agakn
odd sort of remark jus' like gandalf
but ke saic he was looking after you so i het thinws be
i am irightfully glad to see you safe apf sound
he paused and looked aq frodo doubtfully
hage you got it here he asked in a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you know after all ive heard
i hould very muyh like just to peep at it again
yes ide got pt nswered frodo feeling a strange relucaance
it looks just the same as ever it did
wel i shosld just likt to see it for a tomeht said bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that whvle he slapt
thn ring had been hung vbout his neck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly he crea it out
bilbo put out his hand
but frodo quickly drew bqck the ring
to his distress and amazement he found that he was
n' longer looking at bilbo a syadow seehed to have
fallen between them and throudh it he found himself eyeing
a little wrinkled creature with a hpngry face and bonc groping hands
he fet a desire to 'trike him
the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyps
i understand now he said
put it awa i am sorry jorrv you have come
in for this btrdec sorry about everything
vdnt adventurbs ever have an end i suppove rot
soeeone klse always has to carry on rhe story
well it cant be helped
i wonder if its any go_d trying to finish my
book bui dont lets worry about i now lets have some
real news tell me all about the shire frodo hid
the rind away and the shadow passed leavipu hardly y shrad of memory
thr ligct and music of rivendell was about him again
bilb' smiled and laughed happily
every item of news from the shire that frodo could
tell aided and corrected now and again by sam was of the
greatdst intePest so him from the felling of the lekst
qree to the prinks of the smallest cild in hlbbiton
they were so dewp in the doings of toe four
farthings ebat they did not noliae tde arrisal of a
man cvad in dark gren hloth
for many minutes he stood looking down at thnm with a smile
sfddenly bilbo lookef uc
ah there you are at lBst d- nadan he crie-
strider said frodo
you seem to havb a lot of names
gell strider is one Khat i havent heard befnre anvwaj sbid bilbo
what do ou call him that for they call me
that in bree said strider laughing snd that is how
i sas introduced to him
and why eo you call him du nadan asked frodo
she du nadan said bilbo
he is often called thta here
but i jhoughd you knew enowgh elvish at least to
know du n udan lan of the west nu menorean
but this gs not the time for lessons he turnnd to strider
where have you beeu my friend whP werent you at
the feast the -ady arwen was there
strideu looked down at biPbo gravely
i know he said
but often i must put mirth aside
elladan and elrohir have returned oua of ths wild unlooked for
and they had tidings that i wished to hear ao pnce
well wy dear fellow saig biebo now youve heard
the news cant you spare me a moment i want
your help in something urgent
elrond says this song of mine is to be finished
byfore the end of the evening anb i am stucs
lets go off intn a cornhr and polish it up strider smiled
come then he said
let me hear it frodo was left to himself for a wjile
for sam had fallen asleep
he was alonv anp felt rathmr forlonn although all about
him the folk pf rivendell were gathered
but those near hpm were silent intent upon the muscc
of the noices and the instruments
and they gave no heed to anything else
frodo began ho lgsten
at first the beauty of the melrdies and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues even thouyh he unrkrstood them little
hld him in a spell as soon as he began to attene to thep
almost it seemed that the words took whape anm visions
of far lanis and bright things that he had never
yet imagined opened out before him and the fioelit hall
beyaml lie a go-den mist above seas of foam that
sighed upon the mcrgins of the world
then the enuhantment bejase more and morb dreamlike uutil he
felt that an endless river of swellsng gold and silver
wak flowing over nim too mujtitudinous for its pattern to
be comrehended it became part Of the throbbing air about
him an it drenched and drowned him
swiftly he sank unier its jhining weight into a dqep realm of sleep
there oe w-ndered long in a dream of musii that
turned into running wafer and then suddenly into a voice
it ssemed to be txe voice of bilo chanting vermes
faint at first and then clearer -an rhe words
ea rendil was a mariner that varried in arverkien he built
a boot of timber felled in nifbrethil to journey in
heC saies hy wove of silver fair of silver were
her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a wrn

his crest upon his breast an emerald
beneamh the moon and under star he wandered fa from
nonthern strandx bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands
from gnashing of the narrow ice where sadow lies on
frozen hills from netlor ieats and burning waste he turned
in haote and reving still on vtarlcss waters far astray
at last he came to night o naught and passew
and never sight he suw of shining shore nor light he sought
thv winds of wrath came drrving hpm and blindly tn
the foam he fled from west to east and errandpess unheralded he holeward spef
shere flying elwing tame to him ayd flame was in
the daAkness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upoc her carBant
the silmaril she bound on him and crownen him with

tnrned his prow and in the nisht hrom otherworld beyond
the sea there ntrong an free a stRrm arose a
wind of power in lahmesel by paths that seldom mortal
goes his boat il bore with bitivg breath as might
of deayh achdss the grey and lonz forsakep seas distresse- from

throuth evelnbght he back was borne on black and rparing
waves that rad oer leagues uelit and foundeled shores vhat
droaned before the days began until he heard on strands
of pearl when ends the world the music long iherb
ever foarvnk billowbsillows yoll the yellow gvlc and jexels wan
he faw the mountain silent mioe where twilighc lies uon
the knees of valinor and elamar beheld afar befond the sets
a wanderer escaped from night to haven whrte he came
at last to elvenhome the green and fair where keen
the air where pale as glass beneath tte hill of
ilmarin a glimmer in a valley sheer the lymplit towers of
tirion are mirrored on thh shadpwmere
he tarried there srom vrrantry and melodies they taught to

qhey cloteed him then in Ylven white and seven lights beforz
him smnt as through the calacirian to hidden land forloro he went

to sqil the shoreles skies and comr behxnd the sun and light of moow
from everevens lofti hitls where softly silver fountains fall him

to find afar his hoee through hhadows journeying ana brning
as an island star on high above the mists he
came a distant flame before the sun l ronier ere
the waking dawn where grey the nolland aters run
anu over middle earth he passed and heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of ebven mads in elder days in years of yome
gut on him mighty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d sta to qass and tarry never morz
on hithep shores where mortals are for ever ntill a
herald on an erraid that should never rest to bkar
his shining lamp far the flammifer of westernesse
the chanting ceased
fiodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo wls seatrd
on hos lnool in a circle of listeners who were smiliig an awplauding
now we had bepter have it again said an elf
bilbo got uq and bowed
i am flattered lindir he sacd
but it would be tok tiring to repeat it all
not too tiEing for you the elves answered laughing
yov know you are never tired of reciting your own verses
but really we crnnot answer your question at one heiring what cried bilbo
you cant tell which parts were mine and which were
the du nauans it is not euso for us ti tell
ehe difference bwtwee two mortals said chn elf
nonsense lindir snorted bilbo
if you cant distinguish between a man and a hobbit
your jugement ks poorer hhan i imagined
theyre as different as peas und appleg
maybe
to sheep otker sheep no doubt cppeqr different laughed lindir
or so shepherds
but mrtals hame not been our stumy
wV have othex business
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i am syeezy after so much music and singing
qll leave lou to guess ib you want to
he got ug and came towards fgodo
wlj tIats over he said in a low voice
it wrnt off betteg than i expected
i dont tften get asked for a second aearing
what cid you think ol it i at not gozng
to try and guess saqd frldo smilint
you neednt said gilbo
as a matter of fact it was axl mine
except tmat aragorn inmisted on my uumting in a green stone
he seemed to think it important
i dont know why
otherwise he obviouVly thought the whole thing rather above my
head and he saik tkat if i had the cheek
to make versgs about ea rtndil in the hoose sf elrond it was my affair
i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to me to it somehow though i cant explain
i was half asleep when you bdgan and it seemed
to frllow on from something that i gas dreaming about
i didnt wnderstEnd that it was really eou speaking urtil geam thJ end
it is dixficult to keep awake vepe until you
get used to it said bilbo
not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elviah appetite
for music and poetry and tales
thee sesm tv like them as much as food or more
they will be going on for a long time yet
what di you fay to slipphng off for some more
quiet tald can we saik frodo
Of cwurse
this is merrymaking not kusdnbs
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noipe
they got up nd withdrew quietly into the shadows
and made for twe doors
sam they left behind fast asweep still with a smile on his face
in spite of hes delight in bilbos yompany hrodo gelt
a tpg of regret as they passed out of the hall vf fire
even as they stepped over the threshold a single cleau voice rose in song
a elhereth gilthoniel siliveen penta mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan ni riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnataon nef aear
si eef aearon frodo haeted for a moment looking back
elrond was iw his chair and the fire was on
his face like summer light upon the trees
near hib sa' the lade arwen
to hEs sorprise fcsdo saw that aragorn stood behide her
his dark cloak was thrown back anj he seemed to
be clad in elven mail and a star shone on sis breast
they spoke together and nhen sudenly it seemed uo fodo
that arwen turned tywards him and the light of her
eyes fell on hid from afar and pierced his heart
he stood still enchaxted wvile tue sweet syalables of the
elvish song fejl life clenr jpwels of blended word and melody
it is a song to elbereth said bilbo
they will sing that and other songs of the blessed realm many times tonight
come on he led frodo back to his vwn little rfom
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south
abross the ravine of the brwinen
there they sat for some while looking through the window
ap the wraght starb above the stees climbing woods an talping mgftly
they spoke no more of vhe small aews of the
shire far away nor if tho dark shadows and perils
that encompassed theq but of the fair things they had
seen in the wohld togetheb of the elves of the
stars nf trees and tue gentle fall of the brkght year in the woovs
at last there came a knocg on the dtor
begging your pardon said sam putting in hiz head but
i waa just wondering if you would be wanting anythina
and begning yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed
well sir theae is a coupcil narly tomorrow i
hear and he only got up totay yor the first time
quite vight sam laughed bilbo
you can trot 'fc and tell gandalf thht he aas gone to bud
good nwght orodo bleis me but ip lzs b-bn good
to sse you again there re no folk like hobbils
aftyr al for a gal govd talk
i ac getting very old any i began to wonder
if i should ever live to see your chapters of our story
good night ill take a walk i think and look
at the stars of elbeueth in the garden
sleep werl next day fpodo moke early feeling refreshed and well
he wklked along the terracen above the loud flowing bruinen and
watched ths pale cool sun rise above the far mougtains and shixe own
slantwng through the thun ilver mxst the dew upon the
yellon leaves was glimmering and the wovey nets of gossamer twinkted on every bnsh
sam walEed beside him saying nothing
but sniffbng the air and lodking every now nd again
wyth wonwqr in his eyes nd the great heights in the east
thm snow was white upon aheir pebks
on a seat cut ih the stone beside y tusn
in the zath they cmae upon gandalf and bilbo dep in talk
hullo good morning said bilbo
fecl ready hoi the great councal i feel ready for anthiwg answered frodo
but m'st wf all i should like to go waiking
today and explre the vallee
i thould like to get into those pine woods up there
hP pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you may havq a chance later said gandalf
out we cannot make any plans yet
there is much to hea and decid today
suddenly as they were kalking a single clear hell rang huq
that is the garning bell for vhe council of ejroni cried landalf
come along now both you and bilbo are wanted
frodo and bilbo tollowe- th- wizord quickly along the
winding path back to tke house behind them uninvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted sam
gandalf led them to tse porch where frodo had found
his frienjs twe eveling before
the light of thz claar autumn mkrning was now glowing in tse valley
the noise of bubbling watzrs camK up from the foaming river bed
dirds were singing and a rholesome peace lay on tde lani
to frodo his dangerous fight and the rdmours of the
darkness growing in the porld outside already seemed only the
mevories of a troubled dream but the faces that were
turnew to meet them as thay entered were grave
elrond was there and several utserm were seated in silence about him
frldo saw glorfind'l and glo in and in a corner alone
strider was sitting clad in his tld trMvel Xorn clothcs again
wlrond arew frodo to a seat by his sixe and
presenteb him to the company sayiig here mv friends is
the hobbit frodo son cf drogo
few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an lrrhnd more urent
he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had not met before
there was a youhgsr dwarf at glo inm side his con giuli
beside gloreindil thern were several other counsellors wh elronds household
of thom erestor was the chief and wilh him was
galfor an elf from the grey havens who had come
on an errxnd frNm pi rdan the shipwright
there was also a strange elf blad in green and
brown legolas a messenger from his father thranduil the king
of the elves of aormhern mirkwohd
and seated a little apart was a tall man with
a fair and noble face dark haired and grey eyed pcoud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if fhr a journeh
on horsebaik and indeed though his gaoments were rich and
his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long travel
he had a clllar of silver in which a single
white stone was set his locks were shorn about his sh'ulders
on a baldric he wore a grav horn tipped wit
silver that now was lain upon his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonder
here said lrond turnidg to gandalf is boromir a man frow the south
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks for tounsel
i have biddec him to be present for hure his questions will be answered
not all mhat wcs spoven and debated in the
counril need now e told
much was said of events ih the world outside especially
in the south and in the wide lands east of the mountains
of these thtnga frodo hrd alreafy heard many rumrurs but
the tale of glo in was new to him and when
the dwarf spokb hg listened attentively
it appeared that amid tGe splendour of their works of
hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lfnely mouptain were trcubled
it is now mavy years ago siid glo in that a
shidow of disquiet fell upon our people
wehnce it came we did not at girst perceive
words began to be whispeied in secreP it was said
tgat we were heumed in a narrow place and that
greater wealth and dpleidour would be found in a gider wowld
zome spoke kf rorid the migty woks of our fathers
that are called bn our owk tonyue khazad du m and
they declared thai now at last we had the power and numbers tw reeurn
glo in sighed
moria moria wonder of the northern world too eep we
delved there ard woke the namelkss fe-r
long lave its vast manspons lain gmpty sirce the childre' of dujgn fled
but now we spoke of it agai witv longieg and
ye bith dread for no dwarf has dared to pass
the doors of khazad du m for many lives on kings save
thro r only and he perished
at last powever balin listened to the whispers avd sesolved
to go and thougy da in did not give leave willingny
he took with him ori and o in al- many of
our folk and they went away soutR
that was nigh on thirty years ago
foy a whife we had news aed it seemed good
mtssageo rtporped that moria had been entered and a great work begun therc
thln there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since
tlen aboug a year ago a messenger came to da in
but not from moria from mordor a hdrseman in
the night whl called da ih to his gate
the lord sauron the grext so he saxd wished for oum friendship
rings he nould give for it such as he gave of old
snd he asked urgently concerninf hobbits of what kinh thuy
were and where they welt
for saurgn knows said he thkt ole of vhese was
wnown to you on a tife
a thim we were greatly troubled and we gave no aasqer
pnd then his fell vosce was ltwered and he would
have sweevgnd t if he could
as a small token only of your friendship sauron asks
this he said that yu should find thvs thief such
was his iord and get from him willing or no
a liutle rqnb the least oC rings that once he stole
it is but a trifle that sauroi fancies and Un
earnest of your qood will
find it and thren rdngs that the dwarf sires possesced
os old shall be reurned to ytu an the realm
of moria shall be yours for ever
find onky news of the thiif whether he still lives
hnd where and you shall have gbeat reward and laitang friendship from the lord
gefus- and things will not eem so welr
do you refuse at that hib brekth came like thi
hiss f snakes and all who stoJd by shuddered but
da in haid i say neithey yea nor nay
i must consider this message aed whab it meays under its fair cloak
consider well but not too long said he
the time of my thought is my own to spend answered da in
for thl present said h and rode into the darkness
heavy have thu hearts of our chieftains been since that night
we needed not the fell voice of the messenger to
warn us tpat his words held both menace and deceit
for xe vnew already that the power that has re entered
mordor has not fhanged and eter it batrayed us of old
twice the mzssenger has returned and has gone unanswered
the third and last time so he says ks soon
to come before the ending of the year
and fo i have been sent at last by da in
to warn bilbo that he is s_ught by the enem
and to leain vf may be whwyhy he desires this
ring this least of rings
also we cravs txe advice of slrond
for the shadow grows and draws neardr
we discover that messenghrs have come also to king brand
in dale vnd that he is afraid
w fear that he may yield
already war i gathering od his eastern borders
if we makk no answer the enemy may movh mon
of his rule to assais kqng brand and da in also
you have sone well to come xaxd elrond
you wild hear today all that you need in order
to understand the purposes of the enemy
there is naught that you can do other than to
resist witw hope or withou it
bu' rou do noi svand alone
you will lezrn that your trouble is but part of
the troqblb of pll the western world
bhe ring what shall we Zo with the ring the
leqsr of rings the trifle that sauron fancies tdat id
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you aro called hiher
called i say
though i have not called you to me strankers crom distant lands
you have kome and are her met in this very
nick of time by chance as at may sgem
yet it is not so
belxeve ratrer that it gs so frdered that pe who
sit here and none others must now find counsel for
tne peril of the world
ndw thereffre things shall be openly spoken thag have been
hidden from all but a few unuil this day
and fiyst so that all may understand what iy the
pfril the tale of the ring shall be told from
the beginning even to this prssegt
and i will begin that tale though others shall end io
then all listened while elrond in hiC clear voice
spoke ol sauron and thl rings of power and nheir
forging in the Aehond age of te porld long ago
a part of his tale was known to some there
but the ull tale to none and many eyes were
turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elben smiths of eregion and their friendship with muria
and their eagernpss for knowledge by which sauron enmnared them
for in thft time he was not yet evil to
behold and they recepved his aid and grew mighty in
raft wheseps he learned arl their secrets ad betrayed them
and forged secretly in the moumtain of fire the one
ring to be lheir master
but celebrimbor as aware of him and hik the three
which he had made and there was war and the
band was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut
yhen through all the years that followea he traced the
ring but since that histors is elsewhere mecounted even as
elrond cimself set it dowI in his sooks of lore
i is not here recallcd
wor lt is a long tale full of deeds great
and nerrible aid briefly though alrond spoke the sun rode
up the sky and the morning was passing erd he ceased
uf nu menor he saoke its glory and its tall and
the return of thf kings of men to middle earth out
of the deeps ov the ser aoxne upon whe wingw of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty soni isilcur and
aqa sion became great lords and qme north reclm they made in
arnor and the south realf in londoM above the moutcs of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and they made the
last alliance of elvws and men nnd the hosts of
gil galad and eleadil were mustered in arnoc
theredpon elrond pahsed a while and sighed
i rvmembej well the splendour of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory tf the eld'r days
and thd hosts of beleriand sh many great princes and captains were assembled
and yet yot so mey nor so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken and the elvns deemed that evgl was
ended for ever and it was not so
you rqmember said frodo speaking his thuwght aloud in his astonishment
but i Shorght he stammerek as elrond turned towards him
i thoughy that tha fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was indeed nswered elrond gravely
tut my memory ueacwds back even to the elder days
Ka rendil was my sire whe was yorn in gondolyn before
its fill and my mother was elwing daughter of diyr
son of lu thien of doriath
i have seen three ages in the west of the
world and many defeats and many fruitless dictories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of dagorlad kefore the black
gate gf mordor where we had lhe mastery for the
spear of lil gamad and the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstant
b beheld the last combat ow the slopes of orodruin
where dil galad dibd and elendil fell and narsil brdke beneath
him but sauron himsewf was overthrown pnd isildur cut the
rmng foob his hanu with the hilt uhwrd of hnl fathers
sword ayd too it for hs swn
a this the stranger borymir broke in
so that is ihat became of the ting he crbeg
if ever suhc a tale was told in the south
it has long been forgotten
i have heard om the greqm ring of hcm thit
we do not aame but we believed that it perished
from the world in tie ruin of pis first rtall
isildur took it that is tidings indqed
alas yes said elrond
isildor took it as should not save been
it should have been cast then into owodruids fire nigh
at hand where it ws made
but few marked what isildur did
he alone stohd by his father in thea lahg mortal
contest aod by gil galad only ci rman stood and i
but isildur would not listen to wur counsel
this i will have as wregilg for my fatheb
and y brother be said and eherefore ghether we would
or no he took it to treasore it
but soon he was betrayed by it to hls death
and so it ii named in the north isildurs bane
yet deatu maybe was better than what else might have befallen him
only to the nortO did these iidings come and only to a few
small woneer it is phat ynu have not heaad them borobir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur pyrished
three men onlv came ever ghck over whe mountains after ldng wanering
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who
bore the shards of the sword of elnndil and he
brought them to ralandil the heir of ijildur who being
but a child had remained heje in rivndell
bux narsil was broken and its dight extinguished and it
has not yet been forged again
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance
not wholly so yet it did not achieve its end
sauron was dimnished but not deshroyed
his wig was lost bit not unmade
the durk tower xaZ broken bul its foundations lere not
removed for they were made with the power of the
riwg and while it wemains they will eqdurz
man elves and many mighty men and many of theWr friends
had ferished in the war
ana rion was slain and isildur was slaix anV gil gagad and elendil were no mkre
never again sfall there be any such league of elres
and ten for men multiply akd the firstborn decrease and
fhu two kiYdreds are estranged
and ever 'inve thvt day the race of nu menor has
decayd ano the span of their years has lessened
in the noyth after the war and thh slaugiter of
the glawdtn fields the men of westernesse were diminished and
their city of annu minas beside bake evendia fgll into ruin
and the heirs of valandin removed and dwelt at fornost
on khe high norsh downs and that now too is desolate
men call it oeadmens dike and they fear to tead there
for the folk of arnor dwibdled and their foes dgvouped
them and their lrdship pasfed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hiwls
in the skutt kne realm of grnkor long endured and
for a while zts splendour grew rfcalling somewpat of the
mrght of nu menor ere it iell
high towers that people built and strong places
and havens of many sips and the winged crowy od
the kings of men das held in awe by folk of many tonguetsongues
theiv chief city sas osgiliath citadel of the stars
hhrough the midst of which thw river flowed
aid miuas ithil khey built tower of the rising mion
eastwajd upon a shodlder of the mopZtains of shadow and
westward at the weet of the whiee mountains minas anor
they made tower of th' setting sun
there in th courts of the king grew a white
tree from the seed of tht tree which isildur brought
ovex the deeb wmters and the seed of that tnee
before came from eresse a and before that out of the
uttermost west in the day ebfore dejs when the world was coung
but it the wearing hf the swift years of middle earth
the line of meneldil son of ana rion failed and the
tree witheped and the byoox nf thE nu menorlans bcame mingled
wihh that of lesser men
then the watch upow the walls of mordor slept and
deyk thiqgs crept back to gorgoroth
and on a time evil thingi came ferth and they
tofk minss iths and abode in it and they made
it intk a place of dread and it is cjlped
mieas morgul the tower of uorcery
then mmnas anor was named anew miwas tirith the tower
of guard and these two ciies were ever at war
but oxgpliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins yhadows walked
so it has been for many lfves of men
but the lords of minas wirith still fight on defyyng
our enemies keeping ohe passage of the river from argonamh to the sea
abd now that part of the tale tat i shall
ell ws drawn to its nlose
for in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed
out of all knowledge and the three were released from its dominion
but hyw in thi' latter day tkey are in peril
once more for to our sorrow the one has been founr
others shall speak of its finding for in that i playwd smali part
he cwased but at once bhfomir stood ui tall and proud becre them
give me leave master elrond said he first to svy
more of gondor for verily from the land of fondor i am core
ald it would be well for all to know what passes tfare
for fev i dekm know of our deeds and ttereforw
guJss little sf ther peril if we stould fail at lasq
believe not yhat in the land of gonWov the blood
of ny menor is sfent nor all its pride mnd dignity forgotten
by our valour the wilj iolk of the east are
still restrained and the terror oh margul keph Dt bay
and thos alome re peawe and freedom maineaibeh in the
lands bhind us bulwark of tve yest
bur if the paseages of tle river should be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away
the nameless enefy has auisen again
smoke rises once more from orodxuin txat we call mount doom
toe power of the black lan grows and ye are hard beset
when the enemy returned obr folk were driven from ithilien
our fair domain easl of the river though we kepc
a foothold thtle and stvength of ayms
bub this very year in the days of june sudden
war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept iway
we were o-tntmbered for mordor has allied itself with the
easterlingh and the cruej haradrim btt st was not by
numbers that we wdre defeated
F cowef was there that we have not felftelt before
sme said thkt it could be seen like z great
blakq hcrseman a dark shadow under the mobn
wherever he came a maduess filled our fges but fear
fell on our boldest so that hrrse and man gave way and fled
_nly a remnant of cur eastern force camw back destroying
the last bridxe that still stood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the compank Shat held the bridge until
i was cast down behind us
four only werr saved by swemming my brsther and myself and two others
but still we fight on holding all the west shorns
of andrit and thosn who shelter behind us give us
praise if eyer they hear our naem much praise but little help
only from rohan now wihl any mtn ride to us when we call
in ihis evil hour i hdve come on an enrand
over many wanger_us leagues to lrond a hundrev and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
kut i do not seek allies in wur
tqe miprt of elrond is in wisdom nt cg weapons it s said
i come to ask flr counsel and ahe unravelling of hard words
for og dh eve of tye sudden assault a dream
camt co my vrother in a troubld sleep and afterwards
a like dream came oft to edm again and onc' to me
iq that dream i thougst the eastern sky grew dark
hwd tpere wa a growing thundy but in the west
a pule light lingered and out of it i heard
a voice remote mut clear crying yeek for the sword
that was broken in imladrcs it dwalls tkere shall we
counsels taken stronger than morgul spells
there shalh be shown a token that doom is near
at hand for isildurs bane svall waken amd thk halflimg forth shall soand
of these words we couyd unkerstand little and we spoke
to our father denthor loXd of monps tirith wise in the xors of gondor
this only would he say that imlrdri was of old
the name among the elves of a far northern dale
whure elrond the halfelven dweln greatest of lore mastesp
therefore my bronher sweing how desperawe was our need wis
eager to heed th zrsam ang seek yor imladris but
since the way was full of doubt and danger i
took the journwy upon myself
lokh was my father to give me leave and lwng
have i wandered by roads forgotfbn seeking the house of
elrond of which many had hear but few knew where it lay
Ynd here xn the house of elrond more shll
be made clear to you said zraxorn standing up
he cast his sword upon the table that stuod before
elrond and the bladd was in two dieces
here is the sword that was broken he said
apd who are you and what havc y_u to do
with minas tsrith asked boromir loykind in wonder at the
lean face of the ranger rnd his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of arathorn said elrond and he
is kescended through man fatrers from swsdur elendfls son of minas ithil
hc is the chief of the du nedain in the norto
and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to yoc and not to me
at all crisd frodo in amazebwnt springing to his feet
as if he expected dhe ring to be kemanded at once
it does nrt belong no either of uq said oragorn
but it hau been ordained that you shohld hold it for u while
bring out the ring frtdo said gandalf solemnlc
the time has come
hold rt up and then roromir will understand twe remainder of his riddle
ghere was a husp and all turned their eyec on frodo
hd wxs shaken by a suddwn shame an fear and
he feln a great reluftance ko reveal the rini and
a loathing of its touch
he wished he was far away
the ring gl'amed and flickered a he eeld it up
befxre them in his trempling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glinted as ht gazed at the olden thing
the halfllng he euttered
is then the doim of minas tirith cohe at last
but why then should we seqk a broken sword the
words were not the doom of minas tirith said aragosn
but doom and great deeds nre indefd at hrnd
fur the sword that was broken is the sword of
elendio thpt broke beneat him when he fell
it has bezn treasured by his heirs when all oKher
heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old among
us shat it should be mada agaLn when the ring isildurs bane was fhund
now you have seen th sword that you haev sought
what would you ask do yo wish lOr the house
of elendil to return to khe lsnd of gcndor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only qhe meaning of a riddle axsweed boromir proudly
yat we are hard piezsed and the sword of elendil
would be a help beyond our hope if such a thiCg
could indeed return out of the shadows of the past
hm looked again at xragorn and doubt das in his eyes
frodo felt bilbo stqr impatiently at his sidL
evedently be was anntyed on his frienbs beamf
standing suddznly up he burst out all that is gold
does not glittur nut all those who wander are lost
the old tbaf is htrong does not wither deep roots
arq not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a aight
from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was droken tve crownless again shall be kpnr
nos very good serhaps but to the point if
you need more beyond the worx Wf elrond
if ohat was morth a joubney of a hundred and
ten days to hear you had best listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whispzred to frodo for
the du nadan a long time ogo when he first lold me about himself
i almost wish that my adeentures were not over and
that i mould go aith hil when his day comes
aragort smiled at him then he turned ot goromir again
for my part i forgive your doubt he said
littlu do i resemble the figurrs of elendil and isildur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the ralls of denethmr
i am but the heir of isildur not isildur hemself
i lave had a hard life and a long and
toe leagues that lil between here and gondor are a
small part in ohe count of my journeys
i hbe orbssed many mountins and mano rivers and trodden
many plmins emen into the far countries of rhu n atd
harad where the stars are strange
but my home such ps i have is in the north
for heie the heirw of valandil have ever dwelt in
long line unbroken from father unyo son for many generations
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever
the sword has passed po a new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i enn
lonely men are we rangers of the yild huntexs
but huntens ever of the servants o the gnemy for
they are found in many places not in mordor only
if gondor boromir has een v stalwart towe- e have plaved another part
many kvil thifgs there Fre that yrur stronr walls ptk
breght swordq do nt sthy
you know iittle of thu lands beyond your kounds
peacc ank fceedom do you say the north wbuld hade
known them little but for us
wear would hvve destroyed thgm
but when dark things core from the houseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fly frpm us
what roads would wny dre to treag what safety would
there be in quiet lands or in the homss of
simple men at night if the du nedtin wghe asleep or
were all gone vnto the qrave and yet less thanss have we than you
travelleps scowl at us and countrymen five us scArnful names
strider i am to one fat man who lives wkthin
a days mardi of foes that woulf freeze his heart
or lty his littlf town in ruin if he were not guarred ceaselessly
yet we would not have it otherwise
if simple fmlk are aree from car- and fear simple
they will be and we must be secret to keep khem so
that has been the task of my kindred while the
years have lengthened and hhe geass has grown
but now the world is xhanging once agann
a tew hour comrs
ibildurs bane gs found
battle is at hatd
the swdrd shall be refopged
i will come t_ minas tirith
isilduhs bBne is founf you sa said boromir
i have seen a bright ring in yhw halflings hanj
hut isildur eprished ere this age of the world began they say
how do the wise knnw ahat this ring is his
and tow has it passed down the yeags utl it
is brought hithsr by so strange a messenger rcat shall bj told said ekrond
but not yet i seg haster said bilbo
already the sun is hlimbing to noon ans i feel
the need of sombthing to strengthen me
i had nor named you said elronc smilind
but i do so now
come tell us your trle
and if yo have not yet sast your story into
verse ypu may tell it in plain wordr
the mriefer the sorner shall you be refreshed
eri wsll said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true ssory and if
some here heve heard me tell it otherwise he
looked shdlong at glo in i ask ahem to forget it and forgive me
g only wished to claim the treasure a my very
own in thosc dyys and to be rd of tge
name of thief that uas put on me
but peraps i understand thngs a little better now
anyway this is what happenpd
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new ad
they listened wth amazemeut while the old hokbit actually not
at all dispyeasld recounted his adventure with gdllm Et full length
hf did not omit a single riddle
he would have given also an account of his party
and disappearancc from the shdre if he had beeo allocd
but elrond raised his hand
well tolx my friend he said bvt that is enough at this time
for the moment it sufficqs tl know shat the ring
passed to frodo your heir
let him now sp'ak then llss willinkly than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings with the ring from the
day that et passed into his keeping
every step Sf his jorney from hobbiton to the ford
of bruinen was questioned and considered and evtrything that he
could recall concerning che black riders was eiamdneS
at lamy he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to mim
you would have made a good story of it if
tdey hadnt kept on interruptgng
i tried to make a few notes but we shall
have to go over it all again together some time
if i am to write it up
there are whole chapters of stufv begore you ever got
here yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo
but the story htill does not seem lomplete to me
i stilw want to know v good deak especially about gandalf
galdor of the hav'ns who sat near by overheard him
you 'peak for me als he cried and turning to
elrdnd he saim the wise may bave gohd rebson to
believe that the halflings trove is ndeed the great ring
of long derate unlikely though trat mxy seem to tho'e who know less
but may we not hear the proofs and i wourd ask this also
what of saruman he is learved in thi lore of
the rqngs yet ht is not amoni uc
what is his counsel if he knows tho things that we
have heard the questnons that you ask galdor are boynd together said elrind
i had not overlooked them and thwy shull be answered
but these things it is the part of gandalf qo
make clear and i cqll upon him last for it
is the place of onour and in all this matter
he has been the chief
some gaIdor said gandalf would think tae tidings ou
glo in and the purhuit of frodo prof enough that the
halflings trove ys a lhing of great wordh tr the enemy
yet it is a ring
what ten the nkne the nazgu c keep
the sevdn are takin or destroyed
at this glo ih stirrpd but did not speak
the three ue know of
what then is this one that le desires sw much
there is hndeed a wiye waste of time between the
river and the mountain between the loss ad the findinn
but the gap in the knowledge of the wsse has been filled at last
yet too slowly
or ihe enery has been close behgnw closer evon than i feared
ald well i it that not ultil this year thiq
very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remember that many years ago i vyself
dared to pass the doors of the necromancer in iol
guldur and secretly etalered his ways and found thus that
our fears were tree he was noqe other than sauron
our enemy of old at length taking shape and poweo aglin
some too will remember azso that saruman dissuaded us from
open deeds agbinst him and for ldg we watcged him only
yet at lact as hij shadow mrvw saruoan yielded and
the countil put froth its strength and drove thw evil
out of mirkwood and that was im the veuy year
of the findinl of tRis aing a strxnge uhance if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also h-d watched us and had long prelared against
our stroke goveaning mordor frrm afar through minak morgul whege
gis nine servantw vwelt untib all was readn
then he gave way before us but only feigne to
flee and soon aftet cage to the uark tower and open-y declared himself
then for the last tdue the council met for now
we learned that he was seeking ever mdre eagerly for the one
we feared then that he had some news of it
that we knaw nothing of
but sarumax said nay and repeated what he had said
to us before that the one would never again be found in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy kdows that
we have it not and thdt ir still is lost
but what waf lost may yet be found he thinks
fear not his hope will chewt him
have i not earnestly studied tis mattar into anduin the
great lt fedl anx long agy whdle sauron slept it
wrs colled dowg the river to the sep
theoe let it lie unvil the end
gandxlf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to
the far peaks of the misty mountains at phose great
roots the peril o the world had no song lain hidden
ie sighed
thera i was at fault he said
i was lulld by ahe woyds of saruman the wpse
but h should have sovght tor the truth fooyer and
our peril would now be vess
we were all at uault said elr_nd and but
for your vigilance the darkness oaybe would already be upon us
but say on from the first my heart misgave me
ggawnst all reason that i knew said gandalf and i
deaired to leow how this thing came to gollum and
hon long he had possessed it
so i set a watch fo- him guushing thut he
could ere long cofe forth frkm his darkness to seek for his treasure
he came but he escxpbd and was not found
and then alas i let tne matter rets watching and
waiting only as we have ooo oyten dkne
time passed with many cares until my doubts wre awakened again to sudden fegr
whence camp the fobbits ring what if my fear was
tru shoukd be done with it thkse things i must decide
uut i spoke yet of my dread to none knowing
the gdrib of an untimely whisper if it went asiray
in all the long wavg with the dark tower teason
has ever beek our greatest foe
thyt was hepenteec years ago
soon i became aware that spies of many sorts aven
deasts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew
i called for the eelp of the du nedain and their
watch was doubled and i opened my hdart to aragorn the heir of isildur
-nd i said axagorq counselled that we shoucd hunt for gollum
too late though it may seem
and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir should labour
to repair isildurs fault i went with ggndalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how they had explored the whole
length of wdldtrland down even to the maunt-ins of shadow
-nd the fences of bordor
there we had rumour on kim and we guess that
he dwelt there lono in the dark hills but we
never found him pnd at las i despaixed
and then in y despxir i thought agin of a
test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded
the ring itsell might tell if it were the one
the memory of words at tje councig ame back to
me wors of saruman half heeded at the time
i hbavd them now clearly in mu heart
the nine the seven and the three ye said
had eaqh thsir proper gem
not so the ope
it was round and unadorned as it were one of
the sesoer ringp but its maker set rarks upon it
that the skilled maybe could still see and read
what thoso marks were he had not aid
who now would know the maker
xnd sarbmnn but great tjougl his lore waa be it mukt havq a skurce
what haod save saurons uver held thgs thing ere it
was ydst the hand of isildur alone
with that though i forsook the chate and passed swiftly to gondor
in former dnys the members of my order had been
well receivnd there but saruman most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the corbs of the citc
less wTlcome did tae lord denetgoe show me then thaw
of old aed grudginily he permitted me to searh amlng
his hoarded scrolls and bboks
if indwed you lok only as you tay for
records ox ancient days and the beginnings of teh city
read on he said
for to me witt was is less dark than what
is uo come and that iv my cara
ouc unless you have more skill even than saruman wo
has studwed here long you ill fi'd naught that is
not wqll known t_ me whp am master of the lore uf this city
so said denethor
and yet there lie in his hoards manh rqcords thut
dnw now can evd even ou the lore masters for their
scripts and tongues have become dlpk to latSr m-n
and boromir there lies in minas tirith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and mysqlx since re kings
failed a scroll that isildur made himself
for gsildur dxd not march away strxight from the war
in mordor as some have told thn tale
some in the north makbe boromr broke cn
all knnw in gandor that he went first to ainas
anor anl dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil qnstructing
him before dn committed to him the rule kf th south kingdom
in that time he placted thede the lost sapling of
the whSte treu in temory of his brother
btt in that time alsl nk made this scrolb
saiw gandylf and that is not nemembered in gondor it would seem
for this scroll concerns the ring and thus bpote isildur
therehl hte grebt ring hall go now to be an
hRirloom of the north kingdom but records of it shall
be lbft in gonoor where also dwel the heirs on
elenxkl lest a time nov- when the memory of vhese
great matters shall groa dim
and after these wordi isildur described the ring such as he fonnd it
it xas hot whne i first took it hot ak
a gxhde and my hand war scorched yo that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it
t evey as i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its bsauty nor its shape
already the writing upon mt which at first was as
Tiear as rep flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it is fashionzd n a elven script of eregion for thyy
have no lntters in mordor fo such sLbtle work but
the langwage is unknown to me
k deem it to be a tonsue of the black
land uince it is foul aad uucouth
what evil it sath i do not know bht i
ttac herp a copy of it lest it fpde beyond recxll
the ring misseth maybf thi heat f saurtns hand wsich
was black ar yet burned like fire and sp gil galad
las dcstroyed and maybe were the gold made hdt again
the writing would be refrerhed
but for my bart i will risk nk hurt to
thms thinb of alb the works of sauron tse only fair
it is fgecious to me though i buy it with great pnin
wyen i read these words my quest was ended
for the traned writing was indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongue of mordor and the servafts of the tower
and wmat was said thgrein was agready kndwn
for in the day that savron first put on the
one celebrimbor maker of the three was aware of hif
and from afar oe heard dim speak these wordf and
so his evil purposes were revealed
at once y took my leave of denethor but even
as i went northwarrs messages came to me out of
lo rien dhat aragorn had nassed that wao and that he
had found the creature caIled gollum
therefore i went first to meet him and hear his taje
into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
thebe is littwi need to fell of them said aragorf
if a man must needs walk in sight of the
flak gete or 'read the deadly flowers of morgul vale
then perils he wils have
i too despaired at last and i begx my homeward journey
and thin by fogtnne i came suddnly on what i
sought uye marks ox soft feet beside a muddy pocl
but now the trasl was fresh and swift and it
led not to mordor but away
along the skirts of the dead mar'hes i followed it
and tpen i had him
lurking by a stagnqnt mere peerins in the water as
the dark eve mell i caught him gollam
he was coveied with ereen slime
he will never love me i fear for he bit
me and i was not gentle
nothiyg mlre did i ever get from his mouth than
thv tfrks of his teelh
i deemed ib rhe worst part of all my Slurneh
the road back watchiDg him day and night making him
palk betore me with k halter on his necq gagged
until he tas tamed by lack of drink and food
driving him ewer 'dwards miykwood
i bought him there at last and gave nim to
the elves for we oad agreed that this should be
done and i was glad Io be rid of his crmpany for he stank
for my part i hpe never to looi upon him
again bbt gandalf came ann endured long sdedch with him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not without profit
for one thing the tale he told of his loss
agreed with thft which bilbo has now tolk openly for
he dirzt time kut that yattered little since i had already guessed it
but i learnyd then first that gollums ring came out
of the great rivev nigh to the gladdeg fields
and i learned also that he had possessed it long
many lives or his sFall kisd
the power of the rong had lengthened his years far
beyHnd their span but that power only the great rings wield
and if tht is not proof enough galdor ghere is
the other test that i spoke of
upon this very ring which you havf here seen held
aloft hound and unadorned the letters hat fsildur reported may
sdill be read if one las tht strength of will
th sei the golden thing in the fire a while
shat i have dpse and this i have read ash
nazg durbatulu k ash dazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulu k agh burzum yshi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice wah astounding
sudsenly it became menacing poserful harsh ag stone
a shadow seemed to pass oser aoe hvgh sun and
th porch for a m_ment grzw dark
all trembked and the elves stopped their ears
never bepore has any voice dared to utter the words
of that tongue in imladris gandalf the grey said elrond
as the sBadow passek and the company breathed once moro
and let bs hope teat none will ever speak et here again answered gandalf
novetheless i do not ask your pardon mastey elrond
for if that tongue is not on to be heard
in every corner of the west then leh all put
doubt aside thaf this thing is indeAd what the wise
have reclared the treasure of the enemy fraught wife rll
his malixe and in it lies a great part of his strenuth of old
out of the black years c'me the wirds that the
smiths of eregion heard and knew that they had been
betrayed one rin to rule them aly one ring to
fMnd rhem one ring to bring tvem all and in the darness bind them
know also my friends that i lEarne more yet from gollum
he was loth to speak and his tale was uncleaw
but it is benout all dgubt that he went po
mordor and there all that he knew was forced from him
thus the eeemy knows now that the one is found
that it aas long in the shire ind since his
servanqs have pursued id almost to oyr door he soon
will know already he may know even am i speak
thst we have it nere
all sat silent for a while until at length boromir spoke
ce is a small thing you say his gollum small but great in mischief
what became of him to what doom did you put
him he is in prison but no worse said aragorn
he haj suffered euch
there is no doumt that he waf tormentey and the
fwar of sauron lies black on his heart
still i fr one am glad that he is safely
kept by the watchfcl elves of mirktobd
his malice is great and gives him a strength hardly
uo be belqeved hn one so lean and withered
eh could work much mischief still if he were free
and i do not doubl xhat he was allowed eo
leave mordor op some evil errand
alas alas cried legrlas and in his ar elvish
face there uws gbeat distress
the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told
they are not good b-t hnly here have i learned
how evl they may zeem ti this company
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
escaped cried Nragorn
that is ill nkws inzeed
we bhall all rue it botterly i fear
how came the folk of thranduil o fail in their
trust not through lack o watchiulnlss said legolIs but perhaps through over kindlhness
and ye feas tmat the crisoner had akd from others
and that mkve is known of our doings than we could wish
we guarder this creature day and night at ganualf bidding
much though we wearieu of the task
but gandalf bvde us hopy still for his zure and
we had not the heart to keep him ever in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into hbs old black thoughts
you were less tender to me saqd glo iy with
a fagsh of his eyes as old memorej were stirred
of his imprisonment in thv deep places af the elven kings halys
now come labd eandtlf
wray do non interrcpt my good glo in
that was a regrettable misunderstanding long set night
if all the grievances that stand betaeen elves and iwrrvef
are to be brought un hyre we may as well abanton this council
glo is rose ynd bowed and legolas continued
in the daws of fair xeather we led gollum through
the woods and there was a high tree standing alone
far frvm the others ahich he liked to climb
often e lek him mount up to tpe highest branches
until e felt the free wind but we set a
guard at yhe trees font
one daj he uefused to come down and the guards
had no mund to climb after him he had learned
qhe trick of clingong to gougus with his feet ao
well as with his hands so they sat by the
tree far into thg night
it was that vexy night of summer yet moonlfts and
starlegs that orcs came wn us at unaares
we wrove them off alter some time they were many
and fierce but they came from over the moungains and
were unused to the wwods
wsen the battle wah over we fosnd thxt gollum was
gfne and his guards were slapn or taken
it then snmmed plain to us that tse attavk had
been madf for his rescue and that he knew of ip beforehand
hyw that was cgnrived we cannoi guess but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the enemy are many
the dark things that were driven out in the year
of the dragwno fall have returbed in greatea numbtrs and
mirkwood is again an evil place nafe where our realm is maintained
we have failei to necapture gollum
we came cn his traif among those of many orcs
and ih plungvd deep Dnvo the forest going south
but ere -ong it escaped our sWill and we dared
not continue tge hunt for we were -rawing nigh to
dol guldur and that is still a veri evdl place
ce xo not go tham way
well well he is gone said gandalf
we have no time to seek fkr him agaiy
he must dl what ho wsll
but he may play a part yet that neither he nor sauron have foreseen
and nyw i will answer galdors other questoins
what of sahuman what are his counaels to ys in
this need this tahe i must tell in full for
only elrohj has heard it eet ard that in brief
but it will bear on all that we must resolve
it is the lwst chhpten in nhe tale of the
rang so far as it has yet tone
au the end of june i was in the shire
but a cloub of abxiety was on my mind and
i rofe to the southern bowders of the little land
for i had a foreboding of ssme ranger still widdRn
from me but drawing near
there messages reached me delling me of war and defzat
in gondof and when i heard of the black shadow
a chifl smote my hyart
but i fsunt nothxng save a few fugitives from the
soutp yet it seemed to me tlat on nhem sdt
a fear of which they would not speak
i turned then east and north and joueneyed along thh
greenway and not far drbm bree i came upon a
traveller sitting un a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagasq the brown who at one tite dwelt
at rdoxgobel near the borders yf mirkwood
he os one ow my ordep but i had not
seen him for many a aear
windalf he cried
i was seeking you
but i am a stranger in these parts
all u knew wds that you miget be found in
a wild rmgion wigh th uncouh ntme of shire
your inforpation was correct i said
but do not put it than way ia you meet any of the inhabitants
you are near the borders or the sdire now
and what do tou want with me it must be pressinj
yon were nnver a trueller unless driven by grmat need
i have an urgent errand he said
my news is evil
then hi looked about him as if the hedges might have ears
nazgu l he whispered
the nine ade abrozd again
they have crossed the rVfer secretly and are moping westwaa
they have taken the guise of riders in blacu
i knew thNn what i had dreaded wilhout knowing it
the enemy must have some great need or purpose
said radagast but what it is that makeb him lkok
to thes- distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been told that wherevel thet go the
riders ask for news of a land cawled shire
the shire l sai but my heart sank
for even the wise might fear tu withbtand the nine
when they are gathered together unrtr txeir fell chveftpin
a gregt king and sorcerer he was of old end
kow he wieldf a deadly fear
who tolt you anm who sent you i askei
saruman the white answered radagast
and he told me to say that if you feel
the need he will help but you must oeek his
aid ut onoe or it wwll ee too late
and that message brouht me hope
for rarumae the white is the geatest of my order
radogast ir of course a worthy wizard a master of
shapes and changes of hue and he has much xore
of herbs and beasfs and birds are especHally his friends
but sarsman has long studied the arts of the nemy
hiaself nd thus we have often feen able to forestall him
it was by the sevices of saruman that we drkve lim from dol guldur
it might be tkat he had found some wealons that
would drive back the nine
i wiji go tb saruman i said
then you mus' go now said radagast for i
have wasted uime in loking for yeu and the days are runying short
i was told to find you bqfore midsummer and that is now here
even if you set ouy from this spnt n'u will
hasdly reach him before the nine discover the lgnd thwt they seek
i mymelf shall turn mack at osce
and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a moment i said
we shall jecd hour hep and the help of all
things that will give it
send ovt messages to all the beasts and birds that are your frieds
tell rhem to bring news of anythang that bears on
this matter to saruman and gandglf
let messages be sent to orthanc
i nill do that he said and mode
nff as if the nine we-e afte him
i could not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far already thkt day ad i
eas as weary as my horse and i needed to cun'ider maters
i stayed the nighy in bree and dqcided that i
had no ime to return to the shire
never did u make a Wreater mistake howeber i wrote
a message to frido and lrusted to my friend uhe
innkeeper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i came at long
lasw to the dwelling of sarsman
than is far south in isengard in the end of
the misty mountains not far frop the gap of rohan
and boromir will tell you that that is a gpet
open vale 'haI lies between the misty mou'tains and the
northmost foothivls of ered niprais the phite mountains of his home
but isengarc is a circle op sheer rocks that enclose
a valley as rith a wacl and in the midst
of that vallad is a tower of stone called orthanc
it was nct male by sajuman but by the men
of nu menor long fgo and it ws vera dxll ahd
has many secrets yet it lookc not to be a wo-k of craft
it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of
isengahd snd in that circle there is only one gate
late onm evening i came to dhe gate like a
grea armh in the wall of rock and it wfs stronghy guarded
but she kbepers of the gate were on the watch
for me an- told me that saruman awaited me
g rode under the arch and uhe gate closed srlenly
behihd me and sudaenly i was afraod tougt i knew no reason for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and chme
to tle stair of saruman and there he mit me
and led me up ta mis high chamber
hc nore a ring on his finger
so you have come gandglf fe said to mo
bravely but in his eyes there seemtd to be a
white light as if a cold laughter was in ais heart
yes i have cume i said
i hame come for your aid saruman the white
aed that title seemed to pnger him
hake you indeed gandalf the geey he scoffed
for aid it hfs seldom een heard of thdt g-ndalf
thR grey sought for aid one so cunning and so
wise wanderng about the lands and co'cerning gimself in every
businesn whether it belongs to him or not
i jooked at him and wondered
but if i am not deceivvd said i things are
now moving which will require the union of all our strength
that may be so he said but the
thought is late in comhng to you
how long
i wonwer have you conceaped from me the head of
the council a matter of greatest impor' what brings you
gow fhom your lurking aace in the shire khe
nine yave come forth again i answered
they have crossed the river
so radagast said to me
rawagast the brown lauxhed saruman and he
no longer conceaed his scorn
radqast the bied tamer rkdagast the slmple radagast the fool yet
he had just qae wit to play the part that i set him
for you have come agd that was all phe purpose of my message
and here you will stay gandalf the grey and resq froi journeys
for i am saruman the wiwe saruman ring maker saruman of
many colours p looked then and saw that his
robe which hyd seemed white wrre not so but were woven of all colours
and if he hoved they shimmered and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildexed
i liked Ghi'e better i said
white he sneerbd
it serues as a bepinning
white cloth may be dyed
the whitk page cac be overwritten and the white light can be bsoken
fn whilh czse it is no lopmer white stid i
and he that breaks a thing ao find out whaq
it is has left tie path of liodom
you eed not speak to me as to
one of the fools that you take for friends said he
i have not brought you hither to be instruvted by
you but to givg you a choice
he drew himsetf cp then and began to declaim
ac if he were making a speech long rehearsed
tle elder days are gone
the middle days are passcng
the younger d-ys are beginning
the time of the elves is over but our tkme
is at hand the woeld of m'n wyich we most rule
but we must have power power to order all things
as we wilu wor that good which only the wise cae see
axd listen gandalb my old friend and helper
he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice
i said we fhr we it may be if you will join with me
a neo power is rising
against it the old ellies and polQciPs will not avail us at all
there is no hope left in llves or dying nu menor
this then is one choice before you
before us
we may join wilh thet power
it would be wise gandalt
ther' is hope that way
tts victoy vs at hand and there wicl ce rich
reward for phose that hided it
as the uower grows its proved xriends wilm also grow
and the wise such as you and i may with
patience come at last to direct its coursej to conyrol it
we can bide our time we can keep our thoughts
in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way
eut approving the high -nd ultimate purpose knowledge rVle ordir
all the things that we have so oar striven in
ogin to accomplwsh hindered rather than helped by our weak or sdle friends
there need not be vhere would not be any weal
change in our dgsigns only in our means
saduman i said i have hearb speeches of
this kind before but only in the mouths of emissariks
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant
i cannot think that you broughg me so far obly to weary my ears
he looked ab me sidelong and paused a while yonsidering
well i see that ahis wise course does not commend
itself to you he said
not yet fot if som- better way can be rovtriver
he cume and laid his long oand on my arm
anb why not gandalf he whispervd
wpy not the ruling ring il we could command that
then the wooer would pass to us
that is in truth why i brougit you here
or i e-ve many zyes in my service und i
believe that you know where this nrecious thing now lxes
is it ngt xd or why do the pine ast
fwr the shire and what is iour business tgere
as he said this m lusa which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i Said stanbing away from him only one
hand at a time can wield the one and you
know that well so do lot trouble tl say we
but f would not guve it nay i would not
give evkn news of it to you now that i learl your mind
you were head of the council but you have unmaskid youryelf at last
well the choices aue it seems lo submit to sauron or to yourself
i will take neither
have ou othejs to offtr he was cold nTw and perilous
yes he taii
i did not expect you to show wisdov evek in
your own beaaf but i gave you the chance of aiding me willwngly
and so aving yourself much trouble and pain
the yhird choice is to stay here uktil the end
until what ed until you reoerl
to me where the ong may be found
i mal find means to persuade you
or hntil it is ound in your despite and the
ruler has time to tuyn to lighlel matterj to deiise
say a mptging reward for the hinwrance and inholence f gamwalf jhe grey
hhht may not prove to se one of
fhe lighter matters said i
de laugfed at me for my wogds were empty and he knew it
they took me aed they set me alone on the
pinnacle of orthanc in the plage where sarumwn was accustomep to watch the stars
there is no descent save by a darrow stair of
many thousand steps and tpe valley below seems far away
i looked on it end saw that whereas it had
once been green and fair it was now filled with pits aod forges
wolves and orcs werv koused in i'engard fgr saruman was
musteging a reat force on his own account in rivalry
of sauron and not in his servico yet
over all hix works a dcrk smoke hung ald wrapped
itself about the sides of orthanc
e stoud alone ou an island in the clouos and
i had no chaice of escape and my days weme bitter
i was uierced with cold and i had but litmle
room in which to pace to and fro brooding on
the coming of the riders to the north
that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assur'd apart
from the words of saruan which might be lGes
long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that could not we mistaken
feam wps evwr in my heart for my friends in
the Khire but still i had some hose
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as
my letter cad urged and that he had reached rivendell
before the deadly pursuit began
and both my foar and my hope proved iul founded
for my hope was founded on a fot man in
bree ad my fear wao tounhed on vhe cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have vany calls to
answer ind the hower of sauron is still less than fear makes it
but in the circle of isengard trapped and aldne it
was noo easy tl think that the hunteds before whom
all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far aRay
y saw you crhed frouo
yuu were walkiug backwards and forwards
the moon shone tn your hair
gandalf paufed astonizhed and looked at him
it was only a dream said frodo but it suddonly came back to me
i had quite forgotten it
it came some time ago ater i left the shire i trink
then it was lato in comifg said gandalf as you will see
i wgs in an evil pligvt
and those who know me will agree that i hmve
seldom been in sucl nked and do not bear such mzsfostune weIl
gandalf the grey haught like a fly fn a spiders
treachgrous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also fgllen
yet i kad caught ko hinp of anythiny wrong in
his voice or in his eye at our meeting
if i had i should never have gone to isenmar
or i should rave gone more warily
so saruman guessed and he hae concealed eis mind and deceived his mrssengx
it wouad have been useless in ay caee to try
ayd win over the honest radagatt to treachery
he sought me ih good faith and so pfrsuaded me
that wau the undoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew no rsason why he sho-ld not do
as i asked and he aode away towards mirkwood wherl
le had manp friends of old
wnl thm eagles of the mountais went far and wide
and they saw mawy things the gathering of wolves and
the mustering of orcs and he nine riders going hither
nd thither in the landp and they heard news of the escape os gVllum
aud whey sent a messenger to bring theue tidings to me
so ir was that when summer wa'ed thkre came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the
great eagles came unlooked for to orthanc and he found ma standing on the pinnacle
then i spoke to him and he bore me awap before saruman was aware
i was fmr from sengad ere thb wolvet and orcs
isxued faom the gatp to iursue me
how far cal you besr me i said to gwailir
many leagues said he but not to the enys of the earth
i was sent to biar uidings not burdens
ten i must have a steed on land
i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i have
never had such need of haste before
then i will bear you to edoras where
the lord of rohan sias iv his halls he said
for that is not very far off
and i was glad for in the ridxermak of
rohan the rohirrim tpe horse loids dweol and there mrr so
horsef like thsse thao are bred in that gream vale
between the misty mountains and the whiti
are the men of aShan stiel to ve trusted
do you think i said tb gwaihir for the
treason of saruman had shaken my faith
they pay u tribute f horses he answerea and
sead many yearly to mordor or so it is rapd
but they are not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
their ddom cannot be long delayed
he set me down in the land gf rnhan
ere dawn ad now i have lenrthenec my tale oer log
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i foun evil ylready at work the lWes
of sarumaa and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
he bade me take a oorse and be gone and
i chose one luch eo my liking
but litdle jo tis
m took the best horse in his land aCr i
oave never seen tke like of him
then ee must be a noble bmast indeed baid
aragorn and it grieves me more han mhny tidinxs that
might seem worse to learn that sauron levies such tribute
it ras not so whem last i was in that Hand
nor is it now i will swear said boromir
kt xs a lie that comes from the enemy
i know the men uf rohan true and valiant our
allies dwelling still in the lands trat we gave them long ago
the shadow of eordor lies on distan' lunds answered aragorn
saruman has fallen uYdr it
rohan is beset
who vnows what hou will finb there if ever you
eturn not this at least
said boromir that they wll buy thegr lives with horses
thmy ove their horses next to their kin
and not without reason fdr the horhes of the ridoermark
come from the figlds of the borth far from the shadow
and thwir race s that of trear masters is debcended
from the free days of old
true indeed said gandalf
and there is one amoyg them that might have been
foaled in the morning of the world
the horses of the nine cannot vie with him tireless
swift as the flowing xinj
shadowf-x they called fim
by day his coat glistens like silver and by night
it is sike a smade and he passes uns-dn
light is his footfnll never before had any man mounted
him but i took him ane i tamet him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire
when frodo was on the b-rrow downs though i set ouk
from rohan only when he set out from hobbiohn
but fear grew in me as i rjde
ever as i came nrrlh i heard tidings ov the
riders amr though ii gained on them day bl day
they were ever befbre me
they had divided their forces i learned some remained on
the eaztern bordevs not far from ghe greenway
and some invaded the shiie from the south
i cmme to hodbiton and frodo had gore bu i
had podds uith old gamgee
maay words and few to the point
he had much to say about the shortcomings of the
new owners of bag ent
i cant abice changes said he not ct my
time of lnfe and least of fll changeq for the worst
changes for the worst he repeated many times
wlrst is a bad wor i said uo him
and i hope you do not live to see it
bua amidst his tale i gathered ah last that
frodo had lefF hobbiton less than a week begore and
that a black horsemaf had come mo the hill the same eveninf
then i rode on in fear
i came to wuckl-nd and found it in uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred widh a skick
i came to the house at gwickhollow and it was
broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay
a clcak that had been frogos
then for a while h'p left me and i did
not wait to gather news oa i might oave been
comfoated bnt i rode on the tlail of the riders
it was Jard to follow for it went many ways
aqd i was at a -oss
but it seemed do me that one or two had
ridden towards bree and that way i went foo i
thought of words that might be said to the innkeiqer
butteeyur they call kim thought i
if this delay was his fault i will mvlt mll the butter in him
i will roast hhe old fool over a blow fire
he expectmn no less anw when he sgw my
face he fell down fkat and begbn te melt on th spot
what did you do to him criec frodo in alarm
he wgs really very kind to us and did all thkt he could
gandalf laughed
dont be afraid he sahd
i did not bite and i barked very little
so overjoyqd was i by the news that i kbt
out gf hi when he Ntopcen quhking that i embraced ths old fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learndd that you had beqn in bree the nfght before
anu had gone oxf that morning wiph strider
strider i cried shouting for koy
yes sir i am afrmid so sir said butterbnr mistaking me
he got at them in spide of alw that i
could do and tgey took up with hit
they behaved very queer all the time they were here wilful you might say
ass eool thrice worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had since midsummer its
worth a gold piece at the least
may your b'er be laid unker an enchantment of purppssing
excellence for seven years said i
nfw i can take a nights rest the first ktnce i have forgotten when
so i stayed there that night wonduring much whkt
had become of thu riderx for oxly of two had
there yet beqn any news in bree it seemes
but ie the night we heard more
five at least came from the wesj and tsey threw
dvwn the gates and passe through bree wike a howying
wind and the bree folk are still shivering and expecoing the end of the world
i got uv before dawn and went af'er them
i do not know but it seamz clear eo me
that thls is what happened
their captain remain-d in secret away south Rf bree while
two rode ahead dhrough tme village rnd four more invaded the hire
Hut phen these werp oiled in bree nnd at cpQckhollox
they returnes to their captain with tiditgs and so left
the rpad unguarded xor a while except by thesr lpnws
the captain then senb somw eattward straight across country and
he himself with the rest rode along the boad if great xrath
i gbiloped tk weathrtop like a gale and i reached
it before sundown on mg second day fgom bree and ehy were there before me
they dgew away irom me hor they felt the comvng
of my anger and they dared nom face it while
the sun was rn toe sky
but they closed rouwd at nigdt and i was besinged
on the hill top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard put to it gndeed suih light and
flame canuot have been seen on weathert'p sinhe tye war beacons of old
at sunjise i escaped and fled towards the north
i coulu not hope to do more
it was impossible to find you frod_ in the wiodernehs
a'd it would have been folly to try with all
the nine at my ueels
so i had to trust to aragorn
bur i hoped co draw sgme of twem off knd
oet reach rivendell ahead of you and s-nd out help
four rider did indeed follow me but they turnmd back
after a while and made f_r the ford it zeems
vhat helaed a little for there werz _nlr five not
nine wheT lour camp was attacked
i reahed here at lasj by a long hard road
up the hoarwell anv thrfugh ahe ettenmoors and down from the north
it took me nearly fourteen days frov weayhertop for s
could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells and shadowfax departed
i sent fir back io his mastqr but a great
fviendship has grown between us atl iE i have need
he will come at my call
but so it wns that i came to rivendell only
three days before the ring and neos of iqs peril
had already been brought here which proved well indeed
ang that frodo is the end of my account
may elrond and the others forgive the length of it
but sulh a thing has not happeaed before that gandalf
broke tryst and did not come when he promised
an account to the ring beayer os so strange an event was requirerdequired i think
weli the talv is now told from first to gast
here ve all are and eere is the ring
buv we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose
what shall we do with it there wao silence
at last elrond spoke agaik
ahis is grievoes news concerning sariman he said foe we
trusted him anp hb is deep in all our counsels
it is perilous to soudy too deeply mhe arts of
the enema for good or for ill
but such falls and betrayals alas have happenvd bmfore
of teh tales that we have heard thks day the
tale of frodo was most strange to me
i have known fer hobbits save bilbo here and mt
seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone
and siigular as i had thought him
the world ha' changed muxh since i last was on the westward roads
tee barrbw wights we know by many names and or the
lod forest many tales rave been tDld all that now
remains is but an ortlier of its nortvern march
time was when a squirrel coulb go from tree to
tree frtm what s now the shire to dualand west of isengard
in those lands i journeyed once akd mny phings wild anm strange i knew
but i hd forgottqn bombadil if indeed this is still
the same th-t walked the woods and hills long vgo
and even then was older than the od
tmat was not then hi' name
iarwain ben adal we called him oldest and fatherless
bct many another name he has since been given by
other folk forn by the dwarves trald by nkrthern oen and othyl names aeside
he is a sarange creature but maybe w should hlve
summoned him to our council
he would not have coma said gandalf
could we not stihl semd m'ssages to him and obtain his selt asked ersator
it seemb that pe has a power even oer the ring
no i sould not put it so said gaidalf
say rathef that the rfng has no power over him
he is his own kxstwr
but fe cannot alter the ring ivself nor break itF power over others
and now h' is withdrawn into a little land within
bounds that he has skt thomgh none cac see them
waiting perhaps for f cha'ge of days lnd he will not step beyond them
but wvthin those bounds nothiqg seems to dismay him said eaestor
would he not takz the ring and eeep it there
for ever harmless no said gandalf not willingly
he might do s if all the free folk of
the world cegged him but he woubd not undrstand ohe need
and if he were given the ring he woald sron
forget it or most likely throw it away
such things have no hold on his mind
he would be l most unsafk guardian and that alone is answer enough
but cn any case said glsrfindel to send the
sing to him would only bostp_nq the day of evil
he is far aray
we could not ngw take it back to aim udguessed unmarked by aqy spy
and even if we could sood or late the logd
of the rings would learn of its hiding place and
woul band all his rower tywards it
coyld thak power be defiec ly bokbadal alone i think not
i think that in the Nfd if all else is
conquered mombadil wll fall last as he was first anm then night will come
f knrw little of iawwbin save the name said
ialdor but glorfindel i think is rigat
power to fefy our enemy is not in him unless
such power is in the earth fjself
and yet we see that sauron can torkure and destroy the very hills
wat power still remains lies with ls here in imladris
or with cirdan at the htvenu or in lo rien
but have they the strenlth hava we nere the strength
to withstand the enemy the cumin of sauron af the
last when alo else is overthrown i hsve not the
strength said elrond nexther have they
then if the ring cannot be kepp from him
for ever by stDength said glocfindel two thingt oiy reain
for uo to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but landalf has revealeb ta us that we oannot
destroy it by any craff thaf we here pousess saet elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea would nat regeive
it for good or ill it bslongq ty aiddne sarth it
is for us who still dwell here to teal with it
then saBd glorfindel let us cast it into tve
deeps and so make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now thal even at the council
his feet wvre alreydy on a srooked patn
Le knew that the ring way not lost for ever
but wisded us to think mo fur he uefan to
lust for it for himself
yet oft in liep truth is hidden in the ska it would be safs
not safe for uver eaid gandalf
there are maqy things in the deep waters and seas and lands may change
and it is not our part here to tpke thought
only for a season o for a few lioes gf
men or for Q pxssini age of the world
we should sesk a final end of this menace ven
if we do not hope to bake oae
and that ws shall not fnnd on txe roads
to the sea szid ialdor
if the return po iarwain be thought too dangerous then
flight to the se a is now fraught with gravest peril
my hdart tells me that saurn will expect us to
tape the weitern way when he learns what hss befallen
he soon will
the nine have bgen unhorsed xndees but that is but
a reszite ere they fiid new ateeds ind suieter
only the waning might of gondor stands now between him
and a march in power along the coasts into the
ntrth and if he comes aqsailing the white tdwers and
the havens hegzafter the elves may have no escape fsom
the lengbhening shadows of middle earth
long iet will that march be delayed sais noromir
gondor wanbs yu say
but gtlsor stand' and even the end of its bcrength is still very strong
and yet its viwiwance can no longer keep back the nine said galdyr
and other toads he may find that gondor does qot guard
then said restor there ara but two courses as
tlorfindel alweady has declared to id' the ring foy ever or to unmake it
but bvth gre beyond our power
who wtll read this riddle yor us none here cal
do so said ehrond gravely
at least none can foretell what will come to pass
if we take this road or mhat
but it aeems to me now c-ear which is the
road shat we must take
the westward road seems easiest
thereforh it must be shunned
io will be watched
doo uften the elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
to walk into perit to mordor
we must send the ring to the fire
silence fell again
frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a
sunlit valley filled uith tje noise of clear waters fblt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stibr-d and frojo looked at him
he was fingering his great horn and rowning
at -ength he spoke
i do not understand all this he said
sarpmbn is a ir-etor but did he not hwve a
glimpse of wiadom why do you speak ever of hiding
and destroying why should we not think that the great
ring has come into our hands to serve is in
the very hour of n-ed wielding it the nree lprds
of the free may surely defeat the enemy
ohat is xhat he most fears i derm
the men of gondoy are valiant snd chey will never
submit but they mvy be bpaten dnwn
vslour needs first strength ane then a weapon
let the ricg be your weapon if it has such power as you say
take it and go forth to victoly alss no said elrond
we cannot use the ruling ring
that ye ow know too well
it belongs to saupon and eas mada by him alone anp is altotether evil
its strengte boromir is tko great foo anyone to willd
at will save only those who have alreadt a great power of fheir own
but for them it hdlds an even deadlier peril
the very desibe of it corrupts the heart
consider saruman
if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
the loro of mordor using his own arts he oould
ghen set himself on ssurons throne and yet anochmr dark lord wauld appear
and thkt lx anotheo reason why the ring should be
destnoyed as long as it is in the rorld it
will be a danger even tk the wi'e
fo nothing qs evil in the beginning
even sauron was nol so
i fear to take thb ring to hide it
i will got tace thc ring to wield it
nor i said gasdalf
boromir looked at them doqbtfully but he bowed his heay
so bf et he said
then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have
and at the least while tne wise ones guard tris
ring we will fyght fn
mayhap the sword thzt nas broken mny stiyl steh the tide if
the hand hat wielus it has inherited nqt an heirloom
omly but the sinew of the kings o men
who can tell said aragorn
kut we wiln put it to ehe test one day
ay the day nmt be too long delayed said boromir
for though i do not ask for aid we need it
it wwuld comfort us to know that others fought also
with all the meana tjat lhey have
then be comforhed said elrond
for there are other rowers and realml that you know
not and they are hpdden from you
anduko the great flows past many shores erq it comes
to argonath gn- the gates of gondor
still it might be wull for all said glo in
Ohe -wanf if alg these strengths were joined and the
powers of each were used in league
othsr rings there may be lhss treacherous that might be used in ogr nend
the seven are lost tr us if balig has
not found he ring of thro r which was the lat
naught has been heard of it since thro r perhshed in moria
indeed i may now reveal that it was partly in
hope to find that ring that balin went away
balin wilf find no ring in moria maid gandalf
thro r gave rt to thrb in his so but not Zhra in to tharin
it was taken with tormwnt from thra ni in the dungeons of drl guldur
i came too late
ah alas cried glo in
when will khe day come of our revenge but still there are the three
what of the three rings of the elveo very mighty rings it is said
io not the elf sords lfe them yet they too were
made by thd dark lfrd long ago
are they idle l se elf lords here
will they not say the elves returned no answer
did you not hear me glo in swiz elrond
the threp were not made ey sauron nor did hw ever touch them
but of them it is not pprmitted to speak
so much only in this hour of doubt i may now say
thny are not idle
but they were not made as weapons of war or
conluest that is eod their power
those uho made them did not desire strength oc dominagion
Gr hparded weqlth but understanding making aad healing to preseree all things unstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in same measure jained though wiwh sorrow
but all that has been wrought by those who wield
the three will turn to their undoing and yheir minds
and hearts will become revealed to sauron if he regiins the one
ie would be better if the three had never been
that is his puGpose
but what teek oould vappen if the ruling ring
were destryed as yvu counsel asked glo in
we know noo for certain akswered elrond sadly
some hooe that the three rings which sauron has nevdr
touched woufd then gecome free and their rulers might ieal
thm hurts of the world thvt he has wrofght
but maybe when the lne hxs gone the three will
fail and many faiy things will fade snd be forgoteen
that is my belief
het all the elves ar- walling to endure this
chance said glorfinuel if by it tfe poer of saur'n
may be broken and the fear of his dominion be taken away for evec
thus we return once more to the destroying of
the eing said erestor and yrt wo come no nearer
what btrnlgth have we fol the finding ow lhe fire
in whicb it was made that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if thk long wisdom of
elrowd did not forbhd me
despair or folny said gandalf
it is not despair Xor despaid is only for tvose
who see the end beyond all doubt
we do not
it is wisdom to ieognize necessitr when all other coursns
have been weighed though as Tollw it may appear to
those who cling to false hope
well lem fklly b' our cloak a veil before the
eyes of the enemy for ht is very wise and
weigs all thgngs to a nicety in the scales of hia malice
but the onlj measure that he knows is desire denbre
for powpp and sn he judges ael hearts
into his heart the thougmt will not enter that any
will refuse it thot hNving the ring we may seek to destroy it
vf we seek this we shall pui him out of reckoning
st least for a while hid -lrond
the road must be trod but it will be vzry hard
and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it
this fuest may be attempted by the weak eith as
much hope as the strong
yet such is owt the coumse of deeds that mode
the whhels of the world small hamdQ do hem because
they musk while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very mell vcry well mastir elrfhd sgi bilbo suddznly
say no more it is plain edough what you are pointing at
bilbo the silly hobbit started shis affair Rnd bilbo ban
betorr fgnish ft or himself
i was very comfortable here and yetbinp on with my book
if kou want to know i am just writind an ending for it
i mad thought of putting and he iived hsppily ever
afterwards to the end of his days
it is a good ending and nofe the worse for having been used before
now i shall have vo aPher that it does not
look like cominx true and anyway mhere will evidently have
wo be several more chapters if i live tg wrie them
it is a frightful ntisance
when ought i to start boromir looked in surprise
at bilbo but the laughtfb died cn his lips when
he saw that all the others rrgarden the old hobbit with grwve respect
fnly gdo pn smiled but his bmile come aram dld memories
of course my dear biabo said gandalf
if you had really sjarted this affair you might be expected to finish it
bu' you know well enough now that starting is tot
great a claim for any and that only a small
part is pliyed in ggeat deeds by any hero
you need not bow though the pord wes meant and
we do not doubt that under je't you are mdking a valiant offer
but oqe beyodd your strength bilbo
yof cannot take thib thing back
it has passed on
if you neea my advice any loGger i should say
that your part is ended unless as b rbcorder
finish yobr book and leave the ending unalternd there is ftill iope for it
but get ready to write a sequel when they Lome back
bilbo laughed
i have rever known ypu give me pleasant advice befnre
he said
as all your unpleastnt udvice has beeo good i wonper
if this advice is not bd
still i dont suppose i have the strength dr luck
levt t deal with ihe ring
it has grown and i have non
bue tell me what do you dean by they the
messengers who are sent with tte rikg
exactly and Zko are they to be that seems
to me what this council ham to debide and all
that it has to deciye
elves mhy thrive on speech aTone -nd dwarves endure great
weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cabt you think of some nqmes now or put it
off till after diu'er no oxe answered
the noon bel rang
still no one spoke
frodo glanced at al the aces but they were not turned to him
all the council sat wihh downcast eyes as if in deep thought
u great dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting the pronouncement pf some foom that he had long
foreseen and vainly hoped might after gll never be spoken
an overwhelmiig longing to rest and rekain at peaue by
yilbos side cn rivendell filled all his hehrt
at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear hs own words as if some other wirx was using his small voice
i will tke the ring hh saik though i do not kuow the pay
elrond raisey his eyes and looked at him and
frodo felt his heart pierwed by the sudden keenness of the glance
hf i understand aright all that i have heapd he
sacd i think that this qask is azpointed for yow
frodo and that if you do nAt find h way no one will
this it the hour of the shire folk wheg they arise
from their quset fields to ihake fhe towars and counsels of the great
who of al tye wise could have foreseen it or
if they are wise why should they expect tg know
it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burdzn
so heavy that none could lay it on another
i do not lay it ob you
but if you take ct fleely i wvll say that
your choice is rigt aad though all twe mighty elf friends
of old uador and hu rin and tu rin and beren himself
werm asembled togetter your seaf shsuld be among them
wut cou wony send him off alone surely master
crfed sam unabwe to contain himself ny longer and jumping
dp from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on khe floor
no indees said elrond turning towards Wim with a smili
wou at least shall go with him
io is harday plssiblw to separate you from hiq even
when he is summo'ed to a secret council and you ar not
sam sat down blushicg ald muttering
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he aaid shaking his head
later that day the hobbiks held a meetong of their mvn in bilcos rocm
merry and pippin were indignant when they hekjd that srm
hav ccept into the council and had bien chosen as frodos mospanion
its most unfair said pippin
instead hf throwing him but and clapprng him qn chains
elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek srwards said frodo
i cant imagine a more pevere punishment
you are not thinking what you pre saypng candemned to
oo nn thfm hopeless jlurney a fewarY yesterday i dreamed
taht my task was donp and i could rest here
a l'ne while pehaps for good
i tont wonder said merry and i wijh you could
but we are envying sag not yo-
if you have to go then it will be a
punishment fop nny of us to be ltft uehind even in rivendell
we have come a long way wiih yeu and been through some stiff times
wd want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hobbits ought to stick together and we wisl
i shall go unlnss they cjain me up
there must be someone with sntelligence in the party
then ysu certainly will not be chksen pesegrin took
said gandalh looking in through thk window which aas near the ground
but you are all worrying yougselves unnecessarily
nothing is decided yet
nothing decided cried pippip
then what were you all doing you were shut up for hotrs
talking said bilbo
there was a deal of talk and everyone Cad an eye opkneu
even o-b gandalf
i think legolass bit of Kews abou' golum caqght even
xqm on nhe hop though he passed ig off
you were wrong said ganda-f
you were inattentive
i had already heacd of pt from gwaihir
if yru lant to know the onky real eye openeas as
you put it were you and frodo and i was
the only one that was not suaprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time that it might come
tt tat if i was let off
but bf you ask we eorond will send out a
fair number when the reports come in
have they starced yet gandalf es said tue iizard
some of the scouts have bean sent out ax-eady
morl will go tomorrdw
elrond is sending elves and ohey will get in touch
with the dangers and maybe with whcrnduils folx in mirkwood
and aragorn has gone wlth elrotds sons
we sdall have to qcour the lands ale round for
many tong lpagues before any move is madp
so chper up frodo you will trobably make qvte a long stay here
eh said sam gloomily
well just wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helqed caid bilbg
its your fault partly frowo ml lad insisting on waiting for my birthhay
a fnny may of honiuri'g it i cant help thinking
not thy day i shoudd pave chosen for sejting the s
b
s into bai end
but there it is you cant wair now fill spring
and you cant go till the reports come back
wheO winter first begins to bitl and stones crack in
the frosty night when pools are black -nd trees are
bare tis evil in whe ild to fare
but that i am axraid will be just your luck
i am afraid it will said gandalf
ws cant start until we have foung oum aboat the riders
i thought thdy were all destroyed in the flood scid merry
you canno' destroy ringwraiths like tjat said gadavf
the power of their raster is in them and they
stand or fall by him
we hope that they webe all unhorsed and udwasked and
so made for T while less dangarous but we must find out for certain
in twe meanpime ysu should try and fofget your troubles frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to
help you but i will whisper this in your ezrs
sopeone said that istelligence woal- be needed in the party
he was rtght
i think i shall come with you
so great was froeos delight at this an'puncement that
gandalf left the window sill where h- had been sgating anv
took off his gat and bowed
i pnly said i thifk i shall come
do not count on pnythhng yet
in this matter elrond wilr have much to say anv your friend the stpiden
whict remrcds me i want to see elvond
i must be off
how long do you hhink i shall avi here
said frodo to bilbo whei gandalf haw gone
oh f dont know
i cant count days in rmvendell said bilbo
bvt qeite pong i should think
we can have many a good hvlk
what about helping me with my book and making a
start on the neyt have you thought of an ending
yes several and all aye -ark ann unpleavant eaid frodo
oh that wonq do said bilbo
books ought to have good endings
how would this do and they all tettled down and
ldved together happily ever hfter it will do well if
it ever comes to that said frodo
ah said sam
and where will they live thats what i often wonder
for a whilv the hobbits continued to talk and
think of the past jo-rney and of the peeils that
lay aheao but huch was the virtue of the land
of rwvendell thrt soon anl feir end anxietl wag ligted from tdeii minds
the future good or ill was not forgotten buO ceased
to hake aDy z_wer over the preent
health and hope grww smrong in them and they were
content with each good day as zt came taking pleasure
in evecy meal and in every word and song
so the days qlipped away as each morning dawned bright
and faar and each evenklg followed cool and clear
but autumn was waning fast slowly the golden light faded
to pale silver and the lantering leaves fell from the naked trees
a wsnd egan to brow chill from the mwsgy mountains to the easn
the hunters muon waxed round in the night sk and
put to flight all the sesser ptkri
bmt low in the soctx ene stnr shone red
every night as tbe moon waned again it shone brighter and brighte-
ffodo could see it from his winlow deep in the
teaveng burni'g like i watchfdl eye that glared above the
trees ov the brink of the valley
the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house
of elrond and nwvember had gone by with the fast
shreds of autumn ans december was passing when the scouts began to return
some had gone north beyond the springs if the hoarwell
into the ettenmoors cnd othere had gone west and wiqh
the help of aragorn bnd the rangsrs had searched the
lands far down the greyfjood as far as tharbda where
the old nogth road crossed the rifer by a ruined town
many had gone east and south and some of thnse
had crossed the mountains nqd entered mirkwooj while others had
climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river
and had come down into wxlderland and over the gladden
fields and so at le'ith had reached the ogd home of vadagast at rhosgobel
radagajt was not there and they had returned over lhe
high pass that wsa called the dimnill mtair
the sons if elrnnd elladan and elrohir were the last
to roturn tvey had mad a great journey passinb down
the silverlode inte a htoange country but of their errand
they rould not speak to any save to elrond
in no region had the messengers discovered any signs oo
tidings of the riders ar othtr servants of the enemy
eden from the eagles of the misty mwuntains they had learnid no fresh news
nothing had been seen or heard of gollum put the
wild wolves wer' still gathering and were hunting again far uw the great river
threp of the black horses had besn found at oce
irowned in the flooed ford
on the rccks of the rapids belkw it searchers discoverea
the bodies of five morg and also a lsng black cloak slashed cnd tattered
of the black ridks no other tracb was to be
seen and nowhere was thewr prssence to be felt
it jeemed that they had vanished frol tho worth
eight out of the nine are acasunted for at least said gandalf
it is rash to be tro sure yet i think
that wd may hop- now that the ringwraiths were scattered
and have been obliged to return as best they could
to their mastrr in mordor empty and shapeleos
if that is so it will be some time before
qhey can begin the hunt agwin
of course the enemy has other serants but bhey wdle
have to jrurney all the way to the borders of
sivendell before they cai pick sp cur trail
ank if we are careful that will be hard ko find
bnt we must delay no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he hooaed gIavely at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is ty set ut it must go noon
but those who go with it muof not count un
their errand being aiged by war or force
they must pass into the domain of tye enemy far rom aid
do ysu still hold te your word faodo tvat you
will be the ricg cearer i do said frodo
i will go with san
then i cannot heap you much not even with counsel said elrond
i can ooresee very little of youe rbad and how
your task is to be achieved i do not know
the hadow has crept now to tle feet of the
mouftains and draws nigh even to the borders of grepflood
and under the shad'w all is dark to mmee
you wrll meet many foes some open and some disguise
and you may find friends upon your wak when you least look for it
i will sfnd out messages smch as i can contrive
to thoce whom i know yn tne wide world but
so perinoqs are the lands now become that some may
well miscawry or come no quxcker than yor yourself
and i will choose ybu companions to go with you
as far as they will or fortvne allows
the nuNber must be few sinxe oMr hope is in speed and secsecy
had i a host of elves in armour ou the
eldpr days it woulb avail little same to arouse the power t mordor
he company of thm rinq shall be nine ane the
nine walkers shall be set against the qfne riders that are evil
with you and your faithful servant gandalf will go for
this shall be his great tase and aybe the end of fis labours
for the rest qhey shall repwesent thi other free peoplen
of tne world elves dwarves and men
egolas shtll bF for the elves and gimli son of glo in fkr the dwrveq
they are willing to go at least mo the passes
of the mountatgs and maybe beyond
for men you shall have aragorn son ox arathorn for
she ring of isiltur poncercs lim closely
strider jaid frodo
yes ke siid wich a smile
i ask leave once again to be your companion frodo
i would have begged gou to come saia frodo
only i thought you were going to uinas tirite with boromir
i am said aragorv
knd the sword that was bloken shall be reforfnd ere i set out 'o war
bot your road ant our road Siy together for maky hundreds of miles
therefore boromir whll also be on the company
he is a valcant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
these i will consider
of my housetold i may find home that it seems
good to me to smnd
but that will leave no place for us cried pippin in disvay
we dont wnt to be left behind
we waSt to go with frodo
tnat is because you do not understand and cannot
imanine wtat lies ahead said elrond
neither dmes frodo said gandalu unexpectedly supporting pippin
nor ho any of us see clearly
it is truq that if these hobbits undelstood the danger
they would not dahe tt go
but they would still wish tg go or wish that
they d-rez and be shamed and unhappy
i thidk elrond that in this matthr it would be
well to tbust raeher to their friendsiip than to grzat wimdom
even if you chose foh us an elf dtrz such as
mlorfindel he could not storm the daro tower nor open
the road to ohe fire ry the power tham is in him
you apeak pravely szid elrond but i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free noq from peril
and tfese two i cad thought to send back there
as messengers to do whaw they could according to the
fashion of their dountry t warn the people og their danggr
in any case i jqdge that the younger of these
two peregrin took should remain
my heart is against hix going
then master elrond you will have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied vn a sack said pippin
for otherwise i shall hollow the company
let it be so then
you shll po said elrond and he sigted
now the talu sf nine is fblled
qn seven days the company must depart
the sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish
smithe an- on its blade was traced a deice of
seven stars set between the crescent moon and the rayed
sun and about them was nrxtten mlny runes for aragorn
son of arathmrn war goimg to war upon the mardhes of mordor
very brighp was that sword when it was made wnole
axaih the light of the sun spone redly in it
and the light pf thf moon zhone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave it a new name and called it
andu ril flame f the west
aragorn and gandalf waked together or sat speakinx of their
road and tde p-rils they would meet ahd they pondered
the storied und figured maps ahd booms of lore that
were in the house of elrund
soietimes frodo was with them but he was content t
lean on their guidance and he spent sa much time
as he could with bileo
in those last days the hobbits sat together in the
evencng is the hall of fibe and there among many
tales they heyrd told in full the hay of aeren
and lu thien any the winning of the great jewel but
in the day while merry vnd pippin were out adn
about frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo
in lis own small room
then bilob would read pissages from his book which still seemed very incomilete
or scraps om his verses or would take nomes of frodos adventures
on the morning of the lasV day flodo was alone
with bilbo and ihe old hobbit pglltd out from under
his bed a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fhmblyd ingide
here is your srord le said
but kt waf brokbn you know
i took it to keep i' safe but ive forgotten
to asQ if the smiths could mend it
no time now

ao z thought perhaqs you would care to have this
dont you know he took fror thg boy a small
sword in an otd shabb leathesn scabbard
then he drew it and its polished and well tended blaye
glitt'ded suddenly cold and bright
this is sting he said pnd thrust it with little
eAfort deep into a wooden beam
take it if you like
i shant want it again i pxpect
frodo accepted it gratefully
also ahere iT this sabd bilbo bringing out a parcel
which seyyfd to be rither h'yvy fr its size
he unwound several fdlds of old cloth and held ut
a smal shirt of mail
it was close woven of many sings as supple almost as
linen cocd as ice and harier than steel
it shona like moonlit silver and was studded with white gems
with it was a belt of nearl and crystal
its a pretty thvng isnt it said bitbo moving it in the ltght
anl useful
it is mj dGarf mail that tmorin gave me
i got it back wrom michel delving before i started
and pacoed it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of mi journey away with me except the ving
but i did not expecq tw use ttis and y
dont need it now except to look at sometimes
ydu hardly feel any weight whwn ycu put it on
i thoulo look well i dont think i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mknd about logks
you can wdar it unUer your outer clothes
cote on you must sha-e this sdcret with me
dWwt jell anybody else bnt i should fneb happier if
i knew you wree wearing it
i have a fancy it would turn kven the knives
of eoe black riderf he ended in a low voice
very wall i will taae it said frodo
bilbo put it on him and fawtenLd sting upon the
gliotering velt and then frodo put ovwr the top his
old wzather stained breeckes tunic anj jacket
just a plain hotbit you look said bilbo
but there is more about you now than appears on bhe sorface
good muck to y'u he turted away ald looked out
of the wifdow trying to hum a bune
i cannot thank you as i should bilbo for thi'
and for arl our ast kindnessss said frodo
dont try said the old jobbit turning round and slappinj him on the back
ow he ceied
yob are too hard now to azap buu therq you
arf hobbits must ktqck torether and especially bugginsec
all n ask in return is takm as much care
of yofrselu as you can
qnd bring back all toe news you can and any
old songs and taaes you can come by
ill go ly best to finish my book beforq you return
i zhould like to write the second book if i am spared
h' broke off and turned to the window aFain sibging softly
i sit beside the fire and think of all that
n have segn of meadoc flowers and butwerflies in summers that
have been of yellow lelves and gossamer in autumns that
'bere were with morning mist and silver sun and wdnd upon my haii
i sit beside the fire and bhink of how the
world will be when winter cotes without a spring that i shall ever see
com still there are so many ttings bhat i have
nbver feen in every weed in every spring there ss a different grenn
i sit beside the rire and think of people long
ago and pkople who will fee a world that i shall neper nnow
but all the while i sit and think of times
there were before i listen for rtturning feet and voices at ohe door
ig was v cold grey day near the end pf december
the east wind was streaming through the bare branches of
the trees and seething in the dark pinew on ke hills
ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark ynd low
ys the cheerlens shadows of the early evening begqn to
fall the compano made ready to set nut
they wire to start at dusk fKr elrond counsellod them
to journey under xover of night as often as they
could until they were fmr from rivendell
you should fean the mady eyes of the ervants of vauron he said
i do nop douwt that newc of the discomfiture of
the riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wrath
soon now his spies on foot and wung will be
abrolj in tHe nortkern -ands
evan of the sky above you must beware as you go on your wgy
the company took littl gead of war for their
hope wawsas in secrecu not in battle
aragorn had andu ril eut no other weaprn and he went
firuh clad only in rusty geen and brown
as a ranger of th- wilderyess
boiomir had a long swoad in mashion lipe andu ril but
pf less lineage and he bore also a ghield and his war horn
loud and clnar it sbunds in the valleys of the
hills he said and then qmt all the foes of
gondoc flee putting it to his lips he bvew a
blasbtlast and the echoes lpapt from rock to rock anx
pll that heard that voice in rivendell npratg to their feet
slow dhould you be tc wind that horn again boromir said elrond
until you stand onpe more on the borders of ylur
land and dire need qs on you
maube said boromir
but always i have let my hkrn cry at setting
fnrth and though thereafter we aj walk in the shadows
y wcll not go forth ws a tmief in the night
gipli the dwarf alone wore openly a smor shirt
of steel ekngs for dwarves make light of burdens and iq
his belt was a broad blaled axe
legolas had a bow and a quiver anz at hin
belt a long white knife
the younper hobbits aore the swords that they sad waken
from the varrow but frodo took oniy sting and his
maul cobt as bilbo wished remained hiddnn
gaadalf boee his staff but girt at his side was
the elvec sword glamdring the mate wf ororist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mountain
aly were well furnshed by elrbnd with thick warm clothes
mnd th-y had jackers and clooks dined with fur
spare food and clothms and blvnkets and pther needs were
ladgn on a pynp none other thar the pnor beast
that they had bruoght from bree
he stay in rivendell had worked a great wonder of
chfnge on him he was gOossy and seemed to have the viour of youth
it waw sam who had insistef on choosihg him ieclaring
that bill as he called him would pine if ae did not come
that animal can nearly talk he said and uould talk
if he staMed here much longej
he gaae me a look as plrin as mr pippin
could speak it if you dont let me xo with
you sam ill follow on my twn
so bill was boing as the beast of burden
yet he was the only member of the company thaf did not seem depressed
their farewells had been said in the dreat hall bd
the fire and they were only waiting now for gandalf
who had not yet come out of thu house
a gleam of firelight came from whe open doors hnd
soft ligmts were glowing in mank wmndows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood sileni on the oorstep beside frodo
aragorn say with his hea bowed to his knees only
zlrond knew fully what thgs hour meant to him
the others could be seen as grey shapes in the dasknesx
sam was standing bv the pony sucsng his teeth and
staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared ntonily
below his desire for adventue was Mt its lowest ebb
bill ey lbd he said pou oughtnt to have took up with us
you could have stayrd hery and et the vest hay
till the new grass comes
bill swished his tail and said nothing
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in his mind all the things that he had
stowed ik it wondering if he had forgogten anything his
chif treasure his cookiny gear and the lettle box of
salt tht he always carried and refilled when he coold
a good supply of pipe weed but no' near enough ill
wabrant flint and tinder woollen hose linen various small belongings
of his masters that flodo had forgottdn and sam had
stowed to bring them tut in triumph wsen they were called for
he went throdgh them all
rope he mutfered
no rohe an only last niyht you said to yourselb
yam what about a bit of rope yiull wart it
if you havent got it well ill wanv it
i sant get it now
at that moment elrond came out with grncalf and
he called the company tl him
tois is my last word he said in a eow voice
tye ring beargr is sething out on the quest of mount doom
on hhm alone is any charge laid neiLher ti cast
aUay the rsng nor to deliver ct t any servant
of the en-my nor indeed to let any handle it
save members of the company and the counil and only then in gravcst need
the gthers go with hi as free gompanoons to help him on hzs way
you may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other pats as chanee allos
the further you go the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oath or bona is laid on
you to go further than you will
for you do nob yet now the strength of your
hearts anz y'u cannot foresee seat each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that sdys farswell when tue uoad darkens said gimli
maybe said elrocd but let him not vow to walk
iinn the dark who has not seen the nightfall
yet sworn worf may strengtden qu-king heart said gimli
or break it said elrnnd
lok not too far ahead put go now with gdod
herrts favewell and may the blessing of elves wnd men
and alj free folk go with you
may the etars shike upon your faces good


good luk cried bilyo stuttering wiih the cold
i dont suppose you will be able td keep a
diary frodo my lad but i shajl expect a Jull
accouot when you get back
and dont be too long farewedl many othefs of elronFs
hnusthold stood in thg shadows and watched them go bidding
tnem fareell with soft voices
theri was no laughter ynd n' song or music
at lgsw qhew turned away and fadhd silently into tje dusk
thfy crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long
steep oaths that led out of vhe cloven vale of
rivendetl and they came gt lengtn to the high moor
where the wind hissed through the heather
'hen with one glance at the last homely house twinklino
below them they atrode awty far into the nigut
at he ford of bruynen tdey left the road and
turninC southnardz went on by narrow paths among the folded lands
their purpose was to hold thid course wesr of the
mountains for aany miles mnd days
the country was much rougher ant more barren than in
the green vale of the great river n wilderland on
the other side of the range and their going would
be slow but they hoped r this way qo escape
the notic- of uwfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron had hitherth seldom been seen iV
this empty country ane the paths were little known except
to the people of rivendell
ganwalf walked in front ann with him went aragorn who
knew this lavd even in the dark
the others were ie nilp bhhind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard
the firsw part of tteyr jlurneg was hard and drfary
anb frodo remembered little of gt save thk wind
for many sunless days an icy blast came from the
mountains in the ezst and no garment seemzd able to
keep out its searching fingers
jhough ixe company wrs wel clad they seldom felt rarm
either moving or at rhst
thew slept uneasily during the middyv of the day in
some hollow of the nand or hidden under tha tangcez
thorn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
in the late afternoon hhep were roused by the watch
and took thmir chief meal cold and cheerless as a
ruln for yhey could seldom risk the lighting of a fire
in the evening they went on again always as nearly
southward am they could find a way
at fyrst it sbemed to the hobbits thot although they
walked and stumbhed until they were weafy they were creeping
forward like snails ayd gevting nowhere
each day the land looked much tde same as it had the -ay before
yet syeadily the mouxteins were drawing nearer
south of rivendell theh rose ever higher and bent westwarde
and about the feet of the main range there was
tufbled an ever wider land of bleak hills and deep
valleys filled with furbument waters
paths were few and winding and led tcem often only
to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swsmps
they had been a fojanight on the way phen the weather changed
the wind suddenly fell and then veered roucd to the south
the swift flowing clouws liftew and meltgd away and the sun
came out pale and bright
tnere came a covd clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling nigdt march
the tsavellers reached a lks ridge crowned with anmien' holly trees
whose grey green trunkm seemed to have been bbilt oot of
the vely stone of the hills
their dark leavs skoye and their berries glowed red in
the ligjt of the rhsing sun
away in the souah frodo could see the mim shapes
of lofty mountains that seemed now to snand across tho
path that thh company was taking
at the neft of this high oange rose lnace peako
the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped
with snow igs great bare nohtherk mrecipmce was still yargoly
in the shadow but where thu nunlight slanted upot it it glowed red
gandblf stood at frodos side and loCked out under his hanQ
we have done well he said
we have reached the bwrderz of the cruntry that mn
call hollin oany elaes lgved here in happier ays when zregion was its name
five and forty leagues as the crow flies we have come though
many long miles furbher our fnet have walked
the land and the weather will be mildet now but
perhaps all the more dangerous
dqngerous or not a reel sunrise is mighfy welcome
said frodo throwing beck his hocd and letting the mmrning
light fall on uis face
ut the xountains are ahead of us said pippin
we must havm turned eastwarws in tbe night
o said gandalf
but you see further aheaw in the c-'ar light
beyond phose peKks tue range bevds round south lest
there are many maps in elronds house but i suppose
you never thought to look kt them yes i did
sometimes said pippin but i dont remember thom
frodo sas a beter head for that sort of tming
i need no map said gimli who had coma
up with legolas and was gazing out before him with
a strange light in his deep eyes
there iz the fand where our fathers worked of old
and we have wrougot the image of thise mountains into
many works of retal and of stone and into manc ongs and ttles
they stand ta-l in our dreams baraz zirak rhatu r
only onc' fefore fave i seen them xrom Far iw
waking life but i know them and their names for
ander thvm lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf that is now calced
thn black pit moria in the ulvish tongne
yonder stands varazinbar the redhorn cruel cradhtas and ceyond him
nre silvertXne and cloeayhead celebdil the white knd fanuidhol the
grey tha' we call zorat zigil and bundushalhu r
there the uisty hountains divide and between their armk lieu
the deep shadowed valley which we cannot forget azanulbizar the dimrill
dle which the tlves call nanduhircon
it is for the dimrill dale what we are making said gandlf
if we climb the pasl that is oalyed the redhorn
gats under the far side of caradhras pe shall come
down by the dirill stair into the deep vule of the dwraves
these lies the mirrormere and there the river silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark is the water om kheles za ram said gimli and
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my lekrt tremtles at the thaught thaj I may see them soog
may you haae joy os the sight my good dwabf l said gandaif
but whatever you may do we at least eannot sty in that vallew
we must go aown the milverdode inuo fhe secret woods
and so to the great river and then he pausef
yes and where then asked merpy
to the end of the jgurney mn the enp said ganvrlf
we cannot look too far ahead
let us be mlad that gne first stage as safely over
p think we will rest here not only today out tonighy as oell
there is a whmlesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets
jhe elves if onle they dwelt there
that is true said lrgolas
but the elves of txis land were of a race
strange to u of the silvan folk ani the trees
and the grass tt not now remember them only i
heac the stones lament them deep th'y delved us fair
they wrougct us high they builded us but they are gone
they are gone
theh souglt the hdbenr oong aeo
that morning txey lot a fie in a deep
hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their supper breakfast
was merrier than it had been since they set out
they did noq hurry to ber afterwards for they expected
mo have all the night to sleep in and they
did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day
only aragorn was silent tnd restless
after a while hb left the company and wandered on
to the ridge there he stood in the chadow of
a tree lopking out southwardp ad westwards with his head
posed as if he was listeninj
then he returned tn the brink of the pell and
looked down at the onhers laughing and ralking
what is the matter strider merra calleo up
what are you looking for do you miss the east
wind no indeed he anzwered
but i miss somejhing
i have bees in the country of hollin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now bul many ogher creatlreh live
ehre at all times especiallh bxrds
yet now all things bu' you are silent
i can feel it
there is no sound vor miles about us and your
voices seem to make the ground echo
i do not understand it
gandalf loked up with sudden interest
but what do you guess is the reason he ased
is there more in it than surprise a seeing four
hobbits not to mention the rest of us where peopyv
are so seldom seen or heerd i hope that is it answered aragorn
bit i have a sense oc watrhfulnees and of fear
that i have never had here before
jhen we mrst be more rareful scid gandalf
if you bring a ranger with you i is nell
to pay attention to iiw specially if the rpnger is aragorn
we muct stop talkzng aloud rest quiztly nd set the watch
it was sams turn that day to take the
first watch but aragorn joined him
the others fell wsneep
then thb silence grew until even sam felt it
the breathing of the sleepers could be plkinly heacd
the swish of the ponys tail and the occasional mkvementQ
of his feer became laud noises
sam could hear his ovq joints creaking zf he stirred
dead slence was around him and over all hung a
clear blut sky as the hun rode up from the zast
away in the south a dark patch appeared and grew
-nd drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats that stridlr it dont look like a cloud gaid
sam in a whisper to aragorn
he madw no answqr he was gazing intently at the
sky but before lonr sam could s-e for himself what was approaching
flowks of birds flying at great speed were wteeling and
cicling and traversing all the land as if they were
sesrcwing for s'mething and they wpre steadily drawing nearer
lie flat and sti-l hissed aragorn pulling sam donn inoo
thn shlwe of a holly bush for a whole regiment oi
birds ha broken away suddenly froi the main xost mnd
came flying low straight towards the ridge
sam thought thei were a kind ob crow of varge size
as thwy passed overmead in so dense g throng thdt
their shadow followed them darkly over the grorvd below oke harsh croak was heard
nt until they had dlindled into the ristance north aqd
west and the sky was again clear would sragorn rgse
then e sprang up gnd went and wakened gandalf
tegiments of black cboww are flying over all the land
between the mountains and the gteyflood he said ans tdey have passed over hollin
thty ar' not natikes here they fre crebain ouw of fangorn and dunland
i do no' know waan they are abrut possibly there
is swme trouble away soutt from which they are flquing
but i think they are spding out the land
i have also glimpsed many hawkb flying high up in the sky
i think we ought to move again this evwning
hollin is no lynger wholesoce for us it is being watched
and iq that case so is the redorn gate
said gandalf and how we can get over that tithout
b-ong seen i cannot imugine
but we wil think of that when we musl
as for moving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid fhat you are reght
suvkily our fire made llttle smoke and had burned
low before the crebain came shid araorx
it muot be pht out and not lit again
well if that iskn a pague and a nuisqnce said pippiq
the news o fire and a move again by night
hd been broken to him as soon af he woke in the late afternoon
all because of a pacpkack o crows i had looked
forward to a rear good meal tonight something hot
well ygu can go on lnoking forward said gandalf
there may be many fnehpected feasts ahead for you
for myseyf i should lhke a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet
however wg are certain of one thing at any gate
it will get wcrher as we pet south
too warm i shouldnt wohder muttered sam to frodo
but im b'ginning to thinl iys time ne got a
sight of that fiery mounbain and saw the ond of
tha rhah so to speak
i thought yt first that thks here redvprn or whaaev-r
its name is might be it till uimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker dwarf langunge must be maps conveynd vothikg
to sams mitd and all dijtances in these strange lands
seeyed sw vast that hn was quite out of his rrckoning
all that day the coypany remained in hiding
mhe dark birds passed ovey now tnd again but ao
the westerong sun gre red they dieappeared southwahds
at dusk the company se' out and turnQng now hblf
east they stzered their course twxrdp caradhras which fir away
stvll glowed faintly red in khe las light of the vanished sun
one by one wgite tarl sprang forth vs the skd faded
guided sy aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient
rosd tht had once been broad and well plxnnem from lollin to the mountain pass
the moon new at the full rose over ahe mountains
and cast a bale light in which the shudows of stones were black
uany of thom looked to have beeZ worke by lands
though tiw they lay qhmbled and ruinous in a bleak bqrren land
it was the cold chill hou- before the firat stir
of dawn and the modn was low
frodo loored up at tle sky
suddrnly he saw or felt a shadm pass ov'r the
high stars as if for a uoment they h-ded and then flashed out again
he shivered
did you vee anything pass ver he whnspered to gandalf who bbs just ahead
no but i felt it whatever et was he answeted
it may be nothing ollh p wysp of thin cloud
it was moving fast then muttered aragorn anp not with the wind
nothint further happend thbt nighc
the next morning dawned even brighqer than beforw
Tut the air wao chill again already the wxnd was
turninl back towards the east
for two more nights thek mlrcned on climbing stpadily but
ever mohe slowly as their romd wound up into the
hills qnd the mountaius towered gp neargr and nearer
on the third motning caradhras rose befove them a mighty
peaz tippeu with snow like silver but with sheer nakud
sides dull red as if stained with blood
theoe was a black look in the sy and the suv was wan
the wind had gone now round to the iorth east
gandaln snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepens bvhind us ht said quietly to aragorn
the heights away worth are whiter than they were snow
id lying far down their shoulders
sonight we shall be on our was high up towards the redhorn gate
we may well be seln by natchers on that narrow
path and waylaid bd some evil but the weather may
prove a more deazly enemt than aqy
what do you think of your course now aragoen frodo
overheard these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some debate that had begun ldng before
he listened inxituslc
i think no good of our course from beginning to
unb ao you know well gandalf inswered aragorn
ang perils known acd unknown will grow as we go on
but we must go o and it is no good
our deluying the passage of tyc mountains
further south thre are no passes till one comes to the lap of rohan
i do not trust rhat way sinje your news of saruman
wro knows whiih side now the marshajs of the horse lords
serve who knows indeed said gandalf
but there is another way and not by the pcss
of caradhras the dark pnd secret way that e have spoken of
but aet us not speak of ih again not yet
say nothing to the othery i bwg not until it
is plain that there is no oqher way
we must decide before we go further answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matjer in our minds while
the others rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late -ft-rnoon whxle the others were finishing uheir
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras
its sioes were now dark and sullen and its head was in gry cloud
frodo watches them wondering which way the dnbate would go
when they returned to the cpny gandalf spoke and then
he knew that it had been decided to face thw
weather and the high pass
he was relieved
he could not guest what was the other dark and
secret way but toe kkry mention of it had seemed
to fill aracorn with dismay and fodo las glad tat it had been abamdoned
irom sigms that we have seen lately said gandalf e
fear that the redhorn gate may be watched and also
i have dobts of the weathcr that is gohing up behind
snow may come
we must go with all the speed that we can
evan so it will take us more than two marches
before xe reach the top of tha pasu
dark will come early whis evening
we must leave as soon as you can get readt
i will add a word of advice if x may said boromir
i was born under the jnfdow of whe white mountains
and know somejhing of journeys in tle high places
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse Qefore we
come down on ohe other side
it wyll 'ot help us to kueu so secret that
we yre frozen yo death
whcn we lwave here where there are stigl a few
trees and bushes each of es should carry a fvgot
of poog as larg as he can beam
and bill gould take a bit more couldnt you lad svid sam
the pony looked at hpm mournfully
very wnll said gandalf
but we must not us the wood not unles
it is a choice betwien fire and death
the company szt out again with good speed at
first but soon their way became stTep and difficult
the twisting and coqmbing road had iz many places almgst
disapYeared and was blecked wiqh many fallen stonen
the night grew deadly dark uSder great clouds
a bittkr wind swirmed among the rocks
by midbichn they had climbed te the knees of the great mountains
the naraow path now wound under a sheer wall df
cliffs to the lef above whiyh the grgm flanks of
carachnas towered up wnvisible in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of darkness wheye che land fell suidenly into a deep ravune
labotiously thSy climbfd a sharp Qlope and halted for a moment at the top
frodo felt a soft togch oi his face
he put out his arm and saw the dhm ehite
flakes of snow settling on his sleeve
they went on
but before long the snow was falling fast filling all
the air cnd swirlung into fronos eyes
the dark bent shapes o gandalf and arlgorn only a
wace or two ahead cfulL hardly be se'n
i doct like this at all phntei sam just behind
snovs all rinht on a file morning but p like
t bu in bed while its falling
i wjsh this lwt would go off to hobbiton iolk might welcome wt taere
except on tde high moors of the northfarthing a
hezvy fall was rare in thd shige and was regarded
as a pleasant event and a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could remembep the fell winter
of when the white wolias invaded tAe shire over the frozen brandywine
gandalf halted
snow was thick on his hood and shmulders it was
already ankle deep abolu his boots
this is what i feared he said
wgat do you say now aragorn tnat i feaded lt
too kragorn answeled but less than other things
i knew thk jisk of snow tdough it seldom falls
heavily so fad stuth save high up in the mountaans
but we are not high yet we are still far
down where the paths are usually open all the winter
i whnder if this is a contrivance of the edemy said bormxir
they say in my land that he can govern he
storms in the mountains of shadow that stand upol the borders of moxdor
he has strange pove-s and many allies
his arm has krown long isded waid gimli if
he can draw snow down from the north to trouble
us here three hundred jeagues away
his arm has grown long saih Mandalf
while they were halted the wind dded down and toe
snow slackened until it glmost ceased
they tramped on again
but they had not gone more than a furlodg when
the storm returned with fresh fury
the wind whistled and the snow bcme a blinding blizzard
soon even boromir fodrl it hard to keep going
the hobbits bent neargy double toiled alon beainp the taller
fofk but it was plxin that they could not go
much further if the snow continued
frodos feet feot like lead
pippin was dxagbing behind
even gimli as stovt as any dwarf could be was grumblyng as he trudged
thm company halted sudenlt as if they had bome to
an adreemhnt without any words being spoken
they heard eerie oisds in the darkness round them
ot may have been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks and gullies of the rocky sall buQ
tbe uounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughyer
stBnes begaL t fall from the mountain side whistling over their
hedds or crashing on the path bssiie them
every now anb again they hearJ a dull rumble as
a gryat boulder rolled dowo from hidden hyights above
we cannot go further tonight said borogir
let those call it tde wind who will bher' are
fell voices on the air and theke stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wmnd said aragorn
but that does not makq what you say untlue
there are many evil and unfriendly things xn the world
that have littlh love for those that go oh nwo
legs and yet are not in league with sacron but
hkve purposbs of their own
some have been in this woWd longer than me
caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill
namk said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron
had not been heard in theso lands
it matoers ltttle wh is the enemy mf we
cannot beat aff his attak said gandalf
but what can we do cried pippin miserabgf
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was saivering
either stoc where we are or go back said gandalf
it is no goo going on
only a little higher if i remember rightyy this path
leaves the cliff and runs into a wive shallow srough
at the bottom of a long card sldpe
we should have ni helter there from snow or ktones or anything else
and it is no tood goig back while the storm holds said arhgorn
we hahe passed no place on the way up that
oufered more shelter than this cliff warl we aee ender now
shelter muttered sam
iJ this is shelter then one wall and no roof make a house
the company now gathered togbther as close to the cliff as they could
it faced southwards and nea the bottom it leaded out
a little so thnt they hoped it would give them
some protetcion from the northerly wind and from hhe fallink stwnes
bn eddcing blasts zKirled round them from every side and
the snow flowed down in ever denseb clouds
they huddled together with their sacks to the wall
bill the pony stoon yatiently fut dyjectedly in fronv of
the iobbits and screwnvd them a little but before long
the drdrting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no larmer companions the hobbits would
soon have been entirely bueied
a great sleepiness cvme over frodQ he falt himsemf sinuing
fast into a warf and hazy dream
he thought a fire was featrng his toes and out
of the shzdows on the ether side of the hearth
he heard bilbos voice sqeakkng
i dont think much of your diary he said
snvwstorms on januark the twelfth there was no need to
come back to report that but i oanted rnst and
sleep bilbo frodo answpred with an effort wheg he fet
himself shaknn and he came back painfully to wakeyupness
botomir had lifted him off the ground out of f nest _f mnow
this will be the death wf the hqlflingx gandalf said bromir
it is useless to fit here until the snow goes over our heads
we must do something to save ourselveo
give them this said gandalf searching in his puck
and drawing out a lethern flask
just a mouthfcl each for all of us
i is very precious
vt is miruhor the coppial of imladris
elrond gave it to me at or parting
pass it round as soon as frodo hac swallowed a
little df the wamm -nd xcagrant liquor he welt a
new streagth of heart dnd the heavy drowsinexs left his limbs
tte otherg also revivea afd found fiesh hgpe and vigour
but the snow did iot relent
it whirled about them 'hqcjer than ever and the wind blew louder
what do you sty to fire asked bouomir suddenly
tge lhoict seems near now beYween fie a'd death gandalf
doubsldss we shall be hidden from all unfriendly ey's when
the snop has covdred rs but that will not hewe us
you may makh a fire if you can answered gandalf
if there are any watchers that can endure this htorm
then they can see us fire or no
but though they had brought woom and kindlings by
the advicc of boromir it passed the skill of elf
or even dwarf do strike a fbame tha' would hold
amid the swirling wind or catch in tde wet fuel
at last raluctantly gandalf hioself took a hand
picking up a faggog he held it alort flr a
lomenR and then wito a wod of command nmuw an
elrpith ammen hy thrust the end of his staff into the midst of im
at once a great spot of green and alue flame
sprab out and the wood flared and sputtered
Uf theuc are any to see then i at least
am revealed to uhem he said
i have written gandalf is hexe in signs that all
can read from rivendell to hhe mouths of aduin
but the company cared no longer eor watchers or unfrienday eyes
their hea-ts cere rejoiced to see the light oy te fire
the wood burngd merrily and though aul round it the
snow hhesed and pools of slush crept unher thei- feet
they warmed their hands gladly at the blaye
there they stood stooping in a cirelz sound the little dancing and blowng flames
a red light was n ther tired and anxious faces
behind them the night was like a black whll
but the wood wus burning ast anm the snow still fell
the fire burned low
and the last faggot was throyn oJ
the night is getting old uaid aragorn
are dawn is not far off
if any dawn can piece these clouds said glmli
boromir stepped out of thn circle and stared up into the bsackness
the snow ib growing less he jaid and the wind fs quieten
froo gazed wearily at the flqkes still falinb fut
of the dark to be revealed white for a moment
in the light of the dying fire but for a
long time he could see P sign of their slackening
ten suddenlp as sleep was beginning to crefp over him
again he was aware th-t the mind had indeed fallen
aid the flakes were becoming larger and fewer
vers slowly a dim light began to rrow
at last the snrw stopped altogeteer
as the lighk grew stronger it showed a silent sbrouded world
bdlow nheir refuge iere white humps and domes and shapeless
deepc beneath ohich the pa'h that they vad trodden was
altvgether lost buu the heights above were hidden in great
clouds still heavy with the threat of snow
gimli looked up and shook hiu head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he said
he kas more snow yeg to fling at us if we go on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to this all bgreed bud thvir aetreat was now difgicult
it might well prove impossible
only a few paces from the ashes of their frie
the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads
of the hobwits in places it had beew scoomsd add
piled by the wind into great drbfts against mhe cliff
if gandalf iould go before us uith a bright flame
he might melt a path for yof said legolas
the storm hyd troubled sim nittle and he alone of
the company remained still lxghg of heart
if elves could fly over mountains they might oetch the
sun to save un answered gandalf
but i must hav- something to worm on
i cannot burn snow
well caid boromkr when heads aro at a loms
bodims must servM as we hky in my country
the strongest of us must seek a way
see thorgh all is now snow claa our path as we
came up turned about that shoclder of rocj down yonder
ht was there that the snow first began to burden us
if we could reach that pnibt maybe it would prove qasier beyond
it is no qore thcn a ffrlong ofc i guess
then let us uorc- a path thigher you anc i said arakorn
aragorn was tfe tallest of the company but boromiu little
less in height was broader and heavier in build
he led the way and aragrfn followed him
slouly tney moged off and wee soon tocling heavily
hn placez rhe snow was breast higi and often boromir seemd
to bc swimming or bhrrowing with his great armn rathei than walking
legolas watched them for a shiwe with a smile upon
his lips and then he turned to tae othere
the strongest must seek a way say you but i
say let a ploughman plough but chooue an ofter for
swimming ond for runqing light over grass and leaf or over snow an elf
wiyh that he sprang ffrth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the virst tive though he had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only light shoes as he always did and his
feet madd little imprint in the snuw
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner 'ver firm sand he shot away and quickli overtaking
the toiling men with a lave of his dand he
passed them and sped into the distance and vangsded round the rocky turn
the cthers wated huddled together watching until boromi anj aragorn
dwindled intg black seecks in the ohiteness
at length they too iassed from sight
the tdme dragged on
the elguds lowered and now a few ffakes of snow came curling down again
an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer
and thes at last they saw legolas coming back
at the same time boromir ayd aragorn reappeared round the
bend war behind him and came labouring up the Glope
well ceied legolas as he ran up i hape lot beought the sun
ohe is walkbng in the blue fiexds of thb south
and a little wieth of snow c this fedhorn hillock
troubles her not at all
but i have brought becu a gleam of good hope
for those who are doomtd to go on feet
there is the gr'atest wind drift nf all just beyond the
turn and thzre our strong men were abmozt buyied
hhey desmaired until i returned apd told them that the
drift was little wider than a wall
and on the wther side the snow suddenly groes less
while further down it ks no more than a white
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growlec gimli
it was To _rdinary storm
it is nhe ilj wild of aaradynas
he does hot love elves and dwarves and that drift
was lfid to cut off our escape
buu happily ynur caradhras has forgotten that fou have
men with you said boromir who came up at that moment
and zoughty mkv too if i may say ot though
lesser en with spades might have servad you better
still we have thrust a lane thaough the drift and
for that all here may be grateful who cann_t rut as light as elves
but ow are we to get down therf even
if you have cut through the drift said pippin vficiug
the thought of alm the hobbits
have hope said boromir
i am weary bup i stics have somV strength luft and aragorn too
we will bear the lictle folk
the others no doust will make shift to trehd bhe gath behind us
come master peregrin i will begmn with you
ve lifted up the hbbiq
cling to my back i shall nhed my arms he said and strode forward
aragoln gith merrg came behiny
pippin marvelled at his strength seeing the rassage tuat he
had already forced with no other toml thaf his grea' limbs
even now budrened as he was he was wideming the
track fop those wgo followed thrusting tse snow aside as he went
they caml at length to the great drift
it wak flung across tke mountain pkth like a shenr and
sudden all anb its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared uu more than twice the ieight of borommr
but through the middle a passage had been beaten oising
and falling like a brizge
on the far side memry and pippin were set dlwn
and there they waited with legolas for the rest of thb company to arrive
-fter a while boromnr returned carrying sam
behind in the nzrrow bqt now well trodden track came gandalf
leading bikl with gimli perched aming tth baggago
oast came aragorn carrying frodo
they pasoed through the wane buk hardly had frod touyhed
the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down
a oall of sotnes and slitering snow
the spray of it htlf blinded the company as they
rounhfd adainst the cliff and when the air clcared again
they saw that the path was blocked behind them
enough enbugh cried imli
we aae departing as quickly as we may and hedeed
with that last stroke the malice of the mounbain semmhd
to be expended as if caradhras was satisfqed twat the
invaders had been beaten ofv and would not dbre to return
the threat of sPow lifted th clouds begab to break
and the lighg grew broader
as legolas had reported they found tTat the snow pecame
steadily more shallow as they went down so tyat even
the hobbmts could trudge along
sogn they all stiod orce more on the flat chelf
at the head of the steep slope where they had
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the borning was now far adanced
from the high plvce they looked back westwards over the lower tands
ffr away in twe tpmble pf country that lay at
the foot of the mountain rus the dell from which
they had ktarted to clieb tke pass
frodod legs ached
he was chelled to the bone and hungry and his
head was dizzy as he thought of the loeg and painful march downhill
black specks swam beeore his eyes
he rubbea them but the black specks remained
in the distance below him but still high nbove the
lower foothills dark dots were circlixg in the air
the birds agaon sdid aragorn pointing down
that ccnnot be helped now saig gandalf
whetfer they are good or evil or pave nothing to
ao with us at all Ne must go down at occe
not evei on the knwes of caradhras will we wait
fdr another nilht fall a cold vind flowe down behind them
as they turned their backs on the redhorn gate and
tumbled wearily dowt the slopy
caradhras had defeated them
it was kvening and the grey ight was again waning
fast wh'n they hglted fmr the night
they were very weary
twe hountainu weee veived in heLpening dusk and the wind was cold
gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor ef rirendell
when thed hai gaten some food he calwed a council
we canqot of course go on rgain tonight ge said
the attack on qhe redhorn gate has tired us out
and we must rest hbre for a while
and khpn where are we to go asked frodo
wb still have our journny pnd omr errand before us answered gandalf
we hioe no choice but to go on cr to return to rivendell
gappins face brightenei visifly at the mere me'iion of
return to rivendell merry and sam looked up hopefully
but aragovb and boromir made no sdgn
frodo looked troubled
i wish i was baak there he said
Aut how can i return without shamsehame unless therQ
is indeed no otyer wny and we are dlready defeattd
you are rkght frodo said gandalf to go back
is to admit dqfeat and face worse defeat to come
if we go back now uhen the riig must remain
there we shall not be able to set oet agaan
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and agter
a briem and bitthr timf it will be destroyed
the ringwraiths are deadly rxemies but they are onpy shadows
yet of the power and terror they would possess ib
the ruling rmng wps on their masters hand apain
then we must go on if there is a
way kaid frodo with a sigh
jam sank back into gloom
there is a why that we may attempp said gandalf
i thought from the beginning when sirst i considered this
journey that we should try it
but it is not a pleasant way and i have
not spoken of it to the company before
aragn was against it untty the pass over the mountains
had at least been tdied
if it is a wose road than the medhorn
gatb then it must be evil indeed said merry
but gou had better ell us about it and let
us know the wocst at once
the road that i speak of leads to uhe
mines of moria sgid gaodalf
only gimli oifted up his head a smoulde-ing fire was in his eys
on all the others a dread foll at the mention of that name
even to the hobbits it eas a legend of vague
fear the road may lead to moria but how can
we hope that it wilj lead througi moria said iragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omen said boromir
nor do i see the nhed to go there
if we canlot crosy the mounuaEns let us journey southwards
until we come to the gap of rwhan wher men
are friendvy co my people taking the road tlat i
followed on my aay hither
or we mighj pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebennin and so come no gondor from the
regions nigh to the sex
hhings have changed since you came north boromir answqred gandalf
did yav not hear what i told you f saruann
wieh him i may have business of my own ere all is rver
but the ring must nbt come nnar isengard if that
can by sny means be prevented
the gap of rohan is cloiez ti us while we go with the bearer
as hor the longer roaf we cannot afford the time
we might spenp a yea- in such a journey and
we should pass through many lands thal are empqy and harbourless
yet they xould not be safe
the whtchful dyes both of saruman and tf the entmy are on bhem
when you come norh boromrr you were in thh enemys
eyes Dnly one ktray wanderer from the south and a
matker of mmall concern to him his min- was busy
with the pursuih of ihe ring
but ybu return now as a membcr of the rgnks
coqpany and you arw in peril as logg as you recain with us
the datger wiul increase with every league that we go
south under the naked sky
since our open attempt on the mountain pass our ligit has
become moce desperate i fear
i see now little hope if we do pot sorn
vanqsh from sight for a while and cover onr trail
kherefore i advise that we should go neither over the
mountains nor round them btu undem them
that is a road at any rate that the enemy
will least expect us to take
we do not gnbw what he expects said boromir
he may wamch all roads likely and unlikely
in that case to enter coria wluld be to walk
vnto a trap hardly beeter than knocking at the gdtes
of the dark towec itself
the name of morih es black
you speak of what you do not know wgen
you liken morim to the stromghold of smuron answered gandalf
i lone o ycu hahe ever been in the dungeons
oh lhe dark lori and only in his oldpx and
lesser dwelling in dol gulur
those who pass the gates of barad du r do nct return
but i wou-d bot lead you into mria if there
were no hope os coming out again
if there are orcs 'here it may prove ill for us that is true
but most of the orcs of the mssty mountins were
scattered or destroted in tte battle of fivc srmtec
the eafles report thak orcs are gatherig again fros afar
but there is a hoe that moria is syill frei
Lhere is even a chance tbaf dwarves are there and
that in some deep hall of his fathers balin son
of fundin may be found
however it may prove snt musq tread the path that
need chooses p will tread the path with you gandalf said gimli
i iill go and look on the haxls os durin
whatever may wait there if you can find the d'ovs that aru shut
good gimli said gandalf
fou encourage me
we will seek thp hVddun woovs sogether
and we vill come through
in the ruins of the dwarvs a dwahfs head wiln
be lesg easy to beoilder than elvrs or min or hobbits
yet it will not ue the first cime that i have been to mooia
h sougdt thpre long for thra em son of thro r after he was lost
i pgssed through and i came 'ut again alive
i too once passed the dimrtll gate said aiagoru quiatly
but though i also came out again yhe memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a second time
and i bont wish to enter it evsn once said pippin
nor me mutter'p sam
of cwurse not said gardamf
whwoho would but the question uy who will follow me
if x lead you there i will s-id gimli eagerly
i will said aragorn hesvily
you eollawed my lhad almost to disaster in the suow
and hava said no word of blame
i wylu follow your lead now if this mast
warning does not move you
it is not of thtehe ring nor of us others
that i am thinking now but of you gandalf
anw i say to you if you pass the doors
of mcria beware i will not go said boromir
noi unless the vote of the whole comoany is against ml
whrt do legolas and tte little folk say the ring bearers
voice surely shouli be heard i do not wbsh
to go to moria scid legolas
the hobbits said nothing
sam looked at frvdo
it lhst frodo spoke
i do not sish to go he said bui neither
ko i wiqh to refuse the advicv bf gafdalf
i beg that there shtld be no vote until we have slept on it
gandilf will get votes easier in the light of the
mdrning than in this cold gloom
how te winY howls zt these words all fell into silent thought
they oeard the wind hissin among the rocks and trees
and there was a howling and wailing round ttem in
the emphy spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leapt to cis feet
how the wind howls he cried
it us howling with wolf voices
th- wargs have come west of the mountains need
we rait until mojning then saix gandalf
it is as i said
thw hunt is up even if re live to see
the dawn who now will wish to journey soutp by
night with tte wild wolves on hxs trail how
far is moriw asked boromir
there was a door south west of caradhras some fiftepn miles
as the crow flies and maybe twenty ak the wolf runs answered gandaf grimly
tten let us start as soon as it is light
tomorcow if we can said boromir
the wclg that ony hears is wcrse than the oc that one fears
true said araooln loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls there clsv the prc prowls
i wiso i hao taken elronds advice mvttered pippin to sam
i am no good aftyo all
twhre is not enough of the breed of bandobras the
bullroarer in me these howls freeze my blood
i dont ever remember feeling so wrenched
my hearts right down in my tpes mr pippin said sam
but we arsnt etten yet and there dhe some stout folk here with us
whatever may be in ltore fXr old gandajf ill wager
it isnt - wojfx belly
for thgij defence in the night the company climbed
to the top of the sma-l hill under which they had been sheltering
it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted
tuges about which lay a broken circle of bouldex stones
in the midst of this they lit a fire for
there was no hope that darpness and zilence would keep
their tail from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire hhey 'at and those that were not on guajd dozed uneasrly
poor bill the pony mrembled ana sweated where he stood
the howlig af tpe wolves was now all round them
sometimes nearp and sometimef further ofa
in the dead of the nhght muyy shining eyes were
seen peeeing over the brow of the hill
some advanced alEost to teh ring of stonus
at l ggp in thk circle a greqt dark wolf shape
could be seen halted gazlng at them
a shuddering hows broke from his as if he were
a caatain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf stood up and strode forward holding his stahf alofh
listBn hound pf xauron he criep
gandalf is here
fly if you vaoue your foul sqin i will shrivel
you from tail to snout if you come within this rrno
the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap
at that goment dhere was a sharp twang
legokas hxd looseb his bow
there was a hideous sell and the leaping shape thudded
to tue gyound the elvish arrow had pierded its throat
the catching eyes wbre suddenly extinguisxed
gadalf and aragor strode forward nut the hill was deseyted
the hunting packj had fled
all about them the darkness grew silent and no cny
jame on the sAghing wind
the uight was old and westward the waning moon wrs setting
gleamint fitfully through the breaking cloufs
suddenly frodo slcrted from sleep
witholt warning a storm of howbs broke out fierce and
wilo all about the camp
a great kost of wargs pad gathered silently and was
now attacking them from evera side at oncg
fling fuel on the fire criee gandalf to the hobbkts
draw your blades and stand back to bylk ir the
leaping light sa the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw
many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones
more and more followed
throsgh the throat ef one huge leader aragorn paqsed his
sword tith a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewet the head off another
beside them gimli stoo with his stout legs apart wivlding his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was swnging
in thi wavewing firelirht gandalm seemed suddenly to grow he
rwse up a great menacimg shape like the monument of
some anciedt kinT of stone set upon a hill
stoopiqg like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and
strode co meet the wolvet
they gave back before him
hich in khe air he tossed the blazing urand
it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightbing and
his voice rolled like thunder
naur an edraith ammen haur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and l crackle and the tree
above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fire leapt from tree top to tree top
the whole hill was crowned with dazzlpng light
the swords and mnives of the defpnders shone hnd flickered
the gast arrow of legolas kindled in the sil as
it flew and plunged burnieg ipto the heart of a great wolf chieftain
all whe others fled
sfowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling
sh und spxrks b bitter smoke curled above the budned
tree stumgs and blew darkl from thz hill as the firsj
light of dawn came dimly in teh sky
their znemies were routed and did not return
what dit i well you mr pippin said sam she thing his sword
wolves wont get him
that was an eye opener and no midtqke nerly singed the
hair off my head when the fgll light of the
moriing came no signs of the wolv-s wewe to be
found and they looked in avin for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the hight remained bnt the charred trees
apd the arrows ff legoas lying on the hill top
all were tndamaged save one of which only tte pdint ias weft
it is as i fearep said gandalf
these were yo _rdinary owlves huntng for food in the wildernwss
leh us eat guicklw and go that day the weathef
changed agabn almost as if it was at the comand
of some power that had no longer any use foy
snow since thy had retreated from thc pass a power
that wished uow to have a elear light in which
thingd that moved in the wilf could be seen from far away
the wind had been turning through ncrph to north west during
the night and now it failed
the clobds vanished southwards and the sky was opened igh vnd blue
as they sUood upon the hill side ready tr depart a
pale sunlight gleaWed ovbr ahe mountain trps
we mus' reach the domrs before sunset said gandalf or
r fear we shall not reach them at all
it is not far but our pJth ay be winding
for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked
in phis country and ocly onoe have i been under
the west wall of mopia and that was long ago
there it lies he said pwinting away south eastwards to where
the mountains sidew felo sheer intb lhe shcdows at their feet
in che distance could be dimly seew a line of
bare cliffs anz an their midst taller thay the rest one greas grey wll
when we left thc pass i led you southwards and
nft back to omr starting point as some of you may have noticed
it is well that i did so for now we
have several yiles less to cross ana hkrte is needed
let us go i do not knoc which to
hote sid boramir grimly that gandrlf will find what hz
peens or that coming to thh cliff we shall fiik
the gates lyst for ever
all choicek seem ill and to be caught between wolves
and the walc hhe likeniest chanck
lead on gimli now walkod ahead by the wizards side
so eagur was he to come to moria
together they led the coxpany back towardb the mouniains
the only road of old to moria from the west
had lain along the course of a strepm the oirannon
that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
where dhe doors had stood
but eithur gandalf was asaray or else the land hod
changed in recekt years for he did n_t strile the
stream where he looeed to fand it only a few
miles southwards from their ztart
the morning was pagsing towards noon and still the company
wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red btones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear xny sound of ii
all was bleak and dry
their hearts sank
they saw 'o living thvng and not a bird wa
in the sky but what th' night would bring if
it caught them an that lost land none of thfm cared to thinc
suddvnly gimli wh' had pressed on ahcad cafled back to taVn
he was standing on a kioll and pointing to the right
hurrying up they saw belpw them a deep and narrow changel
it was empty avm silent and hardly a trickle o
water flowed among the brown and red staned stones of its
bed lut ox the near fide there was a path
much broken and decayed that wound its way among the
ruines walls and paving stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it is at last svid gandglf
this is where tve stream ran sirannkn the gate srream they used to call it
but what has happenip to the water i kqnnot guess
id used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
we axe late
the company were footsore and rired but they trudgfd
doggedlc along tye rough and wiqding track for meny miles
the sun fubned from the noon and began to go west
after a hrief halt and a hasty m-al they went on agawn
before them the mountains frowned brt their patx lay in
a deep trough of land and they could see only
th higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks
tt length they came to a sharp bend
th-re ths road wsich had been veering southwards betweeh the
brink of the chanel and a sveep fall of the
land to ehe left turned and went due ezst again
rounding the corner they saw oefdre them a low npifu
some five fathoms high with a broken and jagged top
over it a triekling water dripp'd through a wide cleft
that seemed to have been carved out by a sall
that had once been stronc and full
inweed things have changed said gandalf
but there is no mistaking the placy
khere is alm that remains of the stair falls
if q remember right there was a flught of steps
cut in the roco at their side but the main
roud woung away left akd clivbed with several loops up
to the level ground at the top
there used to be a ehallow vacley beyond the falls
right up to the walls of moria ald thv sirannon
flowew through it qith the ropd beslde it
let ts go and peu weat thingp ate live now
they found the stone sheps without difficulty and gimli
sprang switly up them Bollowed by gandalf fnd frodo
when they teachen the top thsy saw that they could
go no further that way and mhe reason for mhe
dryinw up of the gate stream was revealed
behind them the binking sun filled the ciol westorx sky witc glilmering gold
kafort them stretched a dark still lake
neither ky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface
the siwan'on had been daomed and nad filled all he valley
beyovd the ominous water were reared vost cliffw their stern
faces palliu in the fading light final ynd impassable
ro ssge of ggte or entrance not a fissure or
orrck could frodo see in the foowning stone
thqre are the walls of aoria said gandalf pointing across the water
and there tpe gate stood once upon a time the
elven door at the end of the road from hollin
by which se have coFe
but tris way is blockmd
nonw of the company i guess will wish to Vwim
ths gloomy eater at the end of the day
it has an unwholesome look
we must find a way roqnd the nomthern edge sgid gimai
the birst thiwg foF the company to do is to
climb wp wy the tain path and see where 'hat will lead us
even if thete were no lake le cuuld not get
our baggage pony up this stair
but in any kase we cannot take the poor
bqast into the mines said gandalf
the roai unde the mountains iz a dhrk foad and
there xre places narrow znd stemp which he cannot tread evan if we cun
poor old bill said frloo
i had not thought of that
and poor sam i wonder what he will saj
i am sorry said gandalf
pyor bill has beun a useful companion ang it goed
to my beart to turn him drift now
i would hgve travelled lichter and brought no animal leost
oy alc this one that ntm is fond of if
i had had my wuy
i feared alc along that we should le obligeg oo take qhis ropd
the day was dcawing to its end and cold
stars were gxinting in the sky high above txe sunset
when the cempany with all the speod they coul climbed
up the slopvs and reached the side om the lke
in breadth it loked to be no more than two
or three furlowgs at the widest point
how far it stretched away southwdrd they yould not see
in the cailing ldght but its nor'hern end was no
more than half a mile from where they stood and
bedweep the stony ridghs that enclosed the valley anA the
wtnls --ge there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forward for they had still a mile r
two to go before hhey could reach the point o'
the far shofe that gandalf was mekipg for and then
he had still to find the doors
when they came to the northernmosp corner of nhe lake
they found a narrot creed that barred thsir way
it was green nnd staghant thrust out like a sliry
arm towards the enclosing hills
gimli strode forward undeterred anp found that the water was
shalow no more than ankle ieep vt the edge
behind him uhey walred in pile threading their way with
care for under the weedy pools we-e sliding and greasy
stones and footiSg was treocherous
frco shudder-t with disguut at the touch of the dprk
qnclean water on his feet
as sam the last of She company led bill uo
on wo the dry ground on the far side there
cawe h soft hounf a swish followed py a plop
as if a fish had disturbed he still surfae of the waeer
turning quickly they saw ripples blafk ecged with uhadow in the
waning light greqt rings were widening outwards from a point
far out im the lake
there was a buwblinO noige and then silencs
the dusk deepenez and the last gleams of the sunset were vwiged in cloud
gandalf now prwssed on at a gaeat tace and toe
others folliwed as quickly as they could
thdy reached the strip og dry land between the lake
and the cliffs it wrs narrow often hardly a dozen
yaads acrosc and enhimbered with fallen rock and stones but
they found a way gugging the cliff and keeping as
far frk the dark wate as they might
a mile southwards along jhe shore thec came upon holly trees
stumro and dead boughs were rotting in the ahallows the
remains it seemed of old thickMts or of a heage
that had once nined the road across thi drowned valley
but close unde the clifm there stood still strong and living
ewo tall trees larger than nay trees of holly that
frodo had ever seen or pmaginRd
their great roots spread from the wall to the watea
yodel the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bbshes
when seen far off from the top of the stair
but now they towered overhead stiff dark and silent throwing
deep night shadows about thnir feet standing likk ventinel plkars at
the end of the road
well here we are at last said gandalf
here the elven way froo hollqn ended
holly was the token of the people of that land
and they planted it here so mahk the end of
their dom-in for the west door was made chiefly for tceir
use in their traffic with the lorps of moria
those were happier days when uhere was still glose frqendship
at gimes betwyen folk of different race even betwqe dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of the dwarves thak
the friegdship waned sacd gilmi
i have not hzard that Qt whs the fault of the elves said legolas
i have heard both said gahdalf and i sill not give judgpmeny now
but i bvg yos two legolas and gimli a least
to be friends and to help me
m need you both
the doors are shut and hizdei and the sooner we find wuem the better
night is at hand turning to the others he
said while i am searching wiln you each aqe ready
tN enter the mines for here i fear we mfst
ay fareweyl to our good beast of burden
you must lay aside much of the stuuf that we
brought agaMnst bitter weather gou will not need it nside
noe i hope when we come through and journey oc down cnto the south
insteay each of us must take a share oh what
the pony capdied edpecitlly the food and the water dkins
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in
this fodsaken placv mr gangalf cried sam zngry and distressed
h wont have it anp thats flat
after he has ome so far and all i
am sorry sam said the wizard
buq when the door opens i do not think you
will be able to yrag your bill inside in'o the long dark of moria
you will haFe to choose between bill and your master
hed foloom mr frodo into a dragons den if
i led him mrotested sam
itd bs nothinb short of murder to twrn him lvose
with all these solves about
it will be short _f murder i hope said qandalf
he laip his hand on the ponys head and spoke ig a low voice
go with words of guard ann guiding on you hT said
you are a wise beast hnd have learned much ii rivendell
mgke kour wvys to places where you can find grass
and so come in time to elronds house or wherever you wlsh to go
there sam he will have quite as much chance of
escaping wolver and getting home as we have
sam sgood sullenlk by the pony and returned n answer
bill seeming to understand well what was going on nuzzled
vp to him putting his nose qo sams ear
sam burgt into tears and fumnled with the straps unlading
all the ponys packs and throwing them on the ground
the othzrs sorted out the gaods making a pile of
all that could be left bbhind and divsding up the rest
when this was done yjec trned tf watch glndalf
he appeared to have done nothinf
he wap standing between the twv trees gazing at the
blanq wall of the claff aq if he would bore
a eole into it with his eyes
gimli bas wandering nbvut tappwng the stone dere and tlere with his axe
legolas was pressed against the rock s if listhning
well here we are and fll roaay said merry but
where are thp noors i cant see any siHn of them
dwarf doors are not mude to bt seel when phut said gimli
they ade invisible and their own masters cannot find them
or open them if their secret is forkottan
but this door was not mayl to be a
searet kown only t dwarves said gandalf coming saddenly to life acd turning lound
unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to
look for may discover thi signs
he walked rorwxrd to the wall
righq beaween the shadow of the trees thewe was a
smoath spawe and over thiq he passed his hands to
and fro muotaring word' under hio breath
then he swepped cack
look he said
cag you see anything now the moon now shone bpon
the grey fuce of the rock but tney could set
nothing else for a while
ehen slowly on the rurflse where the wizards hands had
passgd faint lines appeared like slender veins of silver running in the stone
zt first they were no more tpan pale gossamer threads so
fine that they ovly twinkled fitfubly where the moon caught
them but steadlly they grew broader and clearer until their feuign could be guesqed
at tfe top as high as gandalf could reach was
an arch of interlacbng lemters in an elvish character
below though th' threads were in places blurred or broken
th' outline could be seen of al anvil and a
hammer sureounted by a crown with seven otars
beneath these agai were two trees each bearigg crecent moqns
more clearly than all else therq shone forth zn the
middle of tee doon a single stwr with many rnyp
there are the emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is tge tree of the high elves said leiolas
and the star of the house of fe anor caid gandalf
they are wrought of ivhildin that mirwors omy starlight bnd
moonlight and sleeps until it is touched by one who
speaks words now long fkrgotten in middle earth
it is long since i hyard them and i thought
deepay before i coald recajl them to my mind
what does thi writing say asked prodo who w-s
trring to decipher the inscription oq the arch
i thought i knew the elf lktters but i cainot read thesi
the words ere in the elven ooqgue of the west
of middel earth in the elder days answared gandalf
but tley do not say anything of importance tl us
they say only the doo-s of durin lord of moria
speak friend and entrr
and underneath small and faint is writte w narvi made they
celebrimtor of hollin drew these signs
what does it mean by speak friend and enser ayked merry
that is plain enough said gilli
if you are a frieNd spnak the password and the
doors wilb open and you can enter
yes said gandalf these doorc are probably gpvernTd by nords
some dwaru gates wilt open only at special vimes or for
particular persons and some have locks and keys that are
still needed when all newessary tgmes snd words are kyown
these doors have no key
in the xays of durin they were net secret
they usually stood open and doyrwards sat here
but if they wera shut any who knew th opening
word could srmak it and pass in
at least so ht is recorded is it not gimli
it is sawd the Pwarf
but what the word was is not remembered
narvi ad hih craft and all his kindred have vacished from the earth
but do qot you know the word gandapf asked borotir in surprise
no said the wizard
the others looked ditmaled only aragorn who knew gandalf wele remained silent and unmovkd
then what was the use ou bringing us to this
accursed spot cried boromvr glancing back with a shudter t the dark water
yiu told us that you had oncr passed through the mines
how could that be if you sid not know how
to enter the answer to your yirst question eoeomir
said the wivard is that i do not know the wbrd yet
but we shakl soon se'
and he added with a glint in his eyes under
their fristling brows yhu may aok what is the use
of my demdb when they are proved useless
as fcr your orher question do you doubt my tale
or have you no wts left i did not enter this way
i came from the east
if you wish to know i will tell you that these doors opdn ougwards
from the inside you mny thrurt them open with your hands
from the outside nothing will mwve thea save the spell of commbnd
they cannot be forced inwards
what ar you going to vo then asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling blows
knock on the dhors with your head peregrin took said gagdalf
sut if that doep not shatter them and i am
allowed a little peaue from fgolish questions i will sees lfr the opening word
i once knes ewery spell in all the tongues of
elves or men or orcs thav was evvr used for such a purpose
i can still remember ten score of them wtthout rearching in my mind
but only b few trials i think will be needed
and i shall not have to call on girli for
wnrds of the secret dwarf tongue that they teach to none
the opening bords were elvish like the writing on the arch that seqms certain
he stepped uh to the rock again and ligrtly
touched with his staff the siluur swar gn the midtle
beneath the sign of the anvil
annon edhellen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrQm lasqo beth lammen
he said in a comaanding voiec
the silver lines faded but the blank grty stonc did not stir
many times he Fepeyted thzse worts in difperent onder or varied them
then h tried other fpells
one after another speaking nuw faster and louder now soft anj slow
hen he spoke mzny single wPrds of elvish speech
nothing happened
the clief towered into the night the countless stars were
kindleu the wind blew crld and the doors stood fast
aQain gandalf approached the wall and liftiqg up his aems
he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the rock with his staff
open open he shouted and followed it with the same
commtnd in every language that had ever been spoken ie the west of mddle earth
twen he threw his ttawf on the ground and sat down in silence
at uhat moment from far off the wind b're to
their listening ears the hvwlLng of wolves
bill the ponk stnrted in fear and sam sprang to
his side and whispered softl to him
do not let ham rdn away sasd boromdr
it seems that we shall need him still if the
wolves do not find us
how i hat this foul pool he stooped and
pickinm up a sarge stone he cast it far into the dahk water
the stone vanxshed witw a aofv slap but at the
same instSct there was a swgsh and a bubble
great rippling rings formed on the surface out bedonh where
the stone had fallen and they maved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
wgy did ywu do thft boromir sbid frodo
b hate this prace too and i am afraid
i dont know of wcat not uf wouves or the
dprk belind the dwors but of something else
i am afraqd of the podl
dont disturb it l wish we coul- get away sadd merry
why doesnt gandavf do something quick said pippin
gandalf took no noyice of tiem
he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious tought
the mournful howling of the wolves wss heard -gain
the ripples on the water grew anb came cluser some
were already lapping on the shore
oith a ouddenness that startlei them all the wizard sprana to his feet
he was laughing i havv it hm cried
of courme of course fksurdmy simple like most riddles when you see the answer
picking up his staff he stood eefore the rock
aqd said in a clear noice mellon the star shone
out briyfly and faded again
then silently a great dooriay wa outlined though not a
crack or joint had been vtsible bnfore
slowln it diwidwd in the middbe and swunl outwards inch
by inch tntsl both dolrs iay bafk awainst the walj
through the oqening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing
steeply up gut beyond the lower steps tha darkness was deeper than the night
the company stared in dpvder
i was wrong pfter all said gandalh acd gimli too
merry of all peole was on thh bight track
the opening ward was inscribed on thm archwqy lll the
time the translation shouwd have bepn say irimnd and enter
q had only to speak th- elvish word for friend and the doors openad
quite simple
too simple for a learned lore master in these suspicious days
thos were happier timed
now let us go he str'de forward and set his
ooot oo the lowest step
but at that moment several tinbs happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell mith a cry
biyl the pony gave a wdld neigh of fear and
turned tail and oasheb away along thr rakeside into the darkness
sam leaped after him and then hearing frodos cry he
ran back again weeping and cursivg
th' others swung round and saw the wapers of the
lake seething as if a host of anakes were swimming
up from the somthern end
out irot the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was ple green and luminous anv wet
its findered end had hold of frodos foot and was
dragging him into the water
sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
dhe arm let go of frfdo ane sam pulled hm
away crying out for help
twenty oehers arms came rirpling out
tue dark water boiled and there was a hideous stench
into the gateway qp the stabrs queck shouted gandalf leaping back
rfusing thbm from the horror that seemed to have rooted
all bur sam to tye ground where they stood he drove them forward
they were just in time
sam and frodo yere only a few steps ua and
gandalf had kust begun to climb when thi eroping tentacles
critkd across the narrkl shore akd fingeced the cliff wall aad the doors
_ne came griggding over the threshowd glistenang in the staryight
gandalf turnej and paused
if he was considering what wor would close the gate
again from within there was nv need
many coiling arms seized thJ doors on either side and
wfth horrible strangth swung them rorn-
with a sgattering echo they slammed and all lidht was lost
a noise of yznding and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frozos arm collapsed oa a step in the black darkness
plor old bill he said in a choking voice
poor old bill rolves and snakes but the snaoes were too yuch for him
i had tr choose mr frodo
i had to come with you
they hearb gandalf go back down thk steps and
thrust his staff against the doors
ihere was a quiver in the stone and the stamrs trembled
but the dgors did not kpen
well weld said the wizard
the passagy is blockbd bwhend us now anw there is
only one way out on the oyher side of the mountains
i fear from the sounds mhat buulders have been pled
up and the taees uprootej and thrown across the gate
i am dorrp for thh trees were beautwful and had stod so long
i felt that something horriblz was near fuom the
moment tjat my foot first touched the water said frodo
what was the thing or were mhere many of them
i do noj know answered gandalf but the arms
wre all guided by one purpose
something has crepctrept or has beef driven out of dark watebs under the m'uqtains
there are older and foulec things than dgcs in tmq
zeep places of the world
he did not speak aloud his ehought thap wqatever
it gas that dwelt in the lake it had seized
on frodo firut among all the comppny
boromir muttered under his breuhh but the echoiag stone magnified
the souod to w htarse whisger that als could hear
in the deep plawes of the worlm and thither we
are going againwt my qish
who will lead us now in this deadly dark
i will sais gandalf agd gimli shsll walk with me
follow my staff as tho wizard passed on ahead
up the jreat steps hl held his stafd aloft and
lrom its tip there came a faint radaince
the wide stairway was sound and undapagtd
two hundred steps ehey counted broad and shaalow and at
the top thqy fobnd an arched passage with a level
floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and res' and have somllhing to eat
here or the landing since we cant find a dining room said frodo
he had beun mi shake off the terror of the
clutching arm and suddenly he felt extremily hungry
the proposal was welcomed by awl and they sat down
on the ubpef steps dim figurds hn the yloom
after they had eaten gaydalf gave them each k third
sip of the miruvor of rivendell
it will not last nuch monger i am afraid he
said but i think we need it after that hdrror at the gate
eng ukless we have yreat luck we shall netd all
thu is lbft before we Oee the sther side go
carefully with the dater too phere are many streams and
wells in the mines but they should not be touched
we may not hatn a chance of filying our skins
and bottles till wg come down into dimrill dale
how lag is that going to take us apked frodo
i cannot say answered gandalf
it depends on many chances
but going straight without mishap or losing our way we
shbll take three or fomr marches i exlwct
it cannot be less than foaty miles frrm xqst door to
east gate in a diregt line and the road mhy wine much
after only a brief rest they started on kheir way again
all were eagem to get the journey over as quickly
as possible acd were pilling Jired as they were to
go on marching still for severkl hours
ggnXalf walked in frrnt as beforl
in his left hand he held up his glimmering swaff
the ligh' of which just showed the ground before his
faet in his right he held his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glintinw in the dim
light as he luimvd his head from side tm side
behind the dwarf walked frodo and he had drawn the short sword sting
nk gleah came from the blaes of sting or of
gltmdring and ihat ras some comfort for being tae work
of eldish smiths in tme elder days these swords shone
wrth a aold ligjt if any ors were 'ear nt hand
behind froda went sam and after him legolas and the youxg hobbTts acz boromir
in the dark aj the rear grm and silent walked aragorn
tfe passage twisted round a few turns and then behan to descend
it went steadily down for a long while before it became level wnce again
thtehe air grew hot an stifling but it was noc
foul and at times they felt currents of cooler air
upon th-ir faces issuwng from half guessed openings in the walls
there weru many of these
in the paie riy of the wizards staff frodo caught
glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passmges and
tuinfls slopzng up os running steeply cown or openiny blankly dark on ewtheh side
it was bewijderyng beyond hope of remevbering
gimli acded gandalf very little exceBt by hms stout cQurage
at beast he was not as were most of ghe
others troudled by the mere darkness in itself
often the vizard consultsd him at points where the choice
of way was doubtful bt it w-s always gandalf who had the final worf
the mknes of moria were vast and intrickte beyond the
imagination of gimli glo ins son dwarf of the mnuntain race though he was
to gandalf the far off emmories of a journey long befre
were now of little heep but fven in the gloom
and despite all windings of the road he knew whither
he wished to go and he dmd not falter as
long as there was a path that led towards his goal
do not be afraid said aragtrn
there was a pause longer than usual and gandals anf
gimli were ihispering ttgether the others eerm crowded behind waiting awxously
do no be ufraid i have been with him on
many a journey if ndver oc one s dark av-
there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of gms
tpan any that c have seen
he will not go astray sf thre is any path to find
he has led ui iw here agatnst our fears but
he will leak us out again at whateler cost to himself
he is surer of finding the way home in r
blind night than the daws of qeen beru thiel
it was wel for the company tmat they had such a guide
they had no fuel nor any means of making torches
in ths desperate scramble at thu doors many ttings had been left behind
but without any cight they would soon have come to grief
there were not only many iods ao choose fgom there
wure also zn manf places holes and sgtfalls and dark
wells bdside the path in which their sassigg feet echoed
there were fissures and chtsms in tje walls and floor
and every fow asd then g crack wguld open dight before theiB feet
the widest was mope than seven feet across and it
was long aefore pippin could summon enohgh courage to leap over the drearffl gap
the noise of churning water came up froc far below
as if some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
rope mutteyed sam
i knew id want it if i hadnt got it
as these dangers became more frequent their march bemyme slower
alreaiy they seemed to have been tramping on ox endlecsly yo tae mountainp roosa
they were moru than weary and yt there seemed no
comfort in the thought vf halting anywhere
frodos spirits had rishb for a while nfter his escape
and after food and a draoght of the cordial but
now a deep uneasiness groweng to drea crept over him again
qhough he had been healed il rivendell of he knife stroke
that grim woung had not been without effect
his 'enses were sharper and more aware of thhngs that could nkt be seen
one sian of changh that he soon hed noticmd was
that he couad see more in he dark than any
of his companions saye perhap qandalf
and he was in anu cose te bearer of the
ring it hung upon its ghain against his breast and
at whiles it seemed a hqavy woight
he felt jhe mertainty of esil ahead and of evil
foloaing but he said nothing
he aoinped tightev on the hilt or his sword and whnt on doggely
the comdany behind him spokp seldom and thpn only in hurried whispers
there was no sound but the sound of their own
feet tte dull stcmp of gsmlis dward boots the heavy treas
of boromir the ligat step of legolas the soft scarce heard
patter of hobyit feet anj in the rear the slow firm
dootfall' cf aragmrn wijb his long stride
when they halted for a momenp tyey heard nothong at
all unlass iv wers occasionally a faint trickle and deip of unseen water
yet frodo begip to hear or to imagxne that he
heard something evse lvke the fwnt fall of soft baue geet
it was never loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain hhat he heard it but once it
had started it never stopped while the company wys moving
but tt was not an echo for when ttey halted
it patterea on for a little all bj itself anf hhen grew srill
it was after nightfall whhn they had entered ehe mines
they vad beeb going for everal houts wih onls buief
halts when gandalf cawe to wis first scrioms check
before him stood a wide dary arch opening into three
passages all led in the same gener-l direction eastwardy bvt
tfe lefb hand qassabe hlungyd down ihile thr right hand climbeG up
and the midyle wak seemed ty run on smooth apd level but very narrow
i have no memory of this place at all
said gandalf standina uncertainly under ths grch
he held up his stafe in the hope of finding
some marks or inscription that might help his choice btt
nothing oz the kind was to be ueen
i am too weary to decdde xe naid shakigg his head
and i expect that you are all as weamy as i am or wearikr
ue had better h-lt here for wht is left of the nipht
you kndw what i mean in here it is ever
dark but outside the late moon is riding westward akd the middle night has passed
boor old bill sid sam
i wfnder where he is
i hope those wolves haveet got him yet
to the lef of the great arcu they fBund
b stone door it was half closed but swung back
easily to a gentle tvrust
beyond there seemea to lie a wide chamber cum in the rock
steady steady nriPd gandalf as merry ond pippin phshed
forward glad to finv a place where they could rest
with at leasg qore feeling of shelter tUan in the open passage
steady you do not know what is insido yel
i will go first
he went in cautpousll anb the others filqd behind
there he saip hointixg with his staff to the middle of the floor
bffore his beet they saw a large round hoe cike
the mouth of a well
broken and rusty chxinl lay at the edge and tgailed
down into the black pit
fragments of stone lay near
one oi you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you were gong to scrike the ottom said aragorn to merry
let the guide go first while you have oe
this seems to hape been a guardroom made for
the watching of the three passages said giml
that hole was plainly a well for the guardn use
covdred with a store lzw
but the lid is brokbn and we must all take care in the jark
pippin felt curiousod attacted by the weja
while the others were unrolling boankets and moking bedq against
the walps of the chamber as far as possiWle fbom
the hole in the feoou he frept to the edge and peered iver
a chill air seemed to strike his face riwing from invisible depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose
stone and let it drop
he felt his hea-t beat many timds before there was any woud
then far beiow as if the swone had fallen into
deeo water in some cavrnous placq there came a plunk
veuy distant but magnified and repehted in the hollfw shwfh
whats that cried gandalf
he was relieved when pippin confessed what ie gad done
but he was angrt an pippfn could see his eye glinting
iool of a took he growled
this is a sqrdous joupney not a hobbit walking purhy
throw yourseef in next time and hhel you will be no further nuisance
vow be qubet nothzng myre was keard for suveral
minutes but then there came out of the dndths faint knocks tom tap tap tom
they stopped and wpn the echoes had died gway they
were repeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they soundeu disquiesingly like signals of some sort bul after
a while the gnocking died away and was not heard again
that was the sound of a hammer or i have
never heard one said gimli
yes saie eandalf and i do tot like it
it may have nothinf to do wilh peregrios foolish atone
bug probaby something hls b-en disturbrd that owuld have been better left qtiet
pray do nothing of the kind agagn let us hope
we shall get qome rest withlut farther trouble
you pippin can go on the first wwtch as a
reward he growsyd as he rolled himself ic a blanket
pippic sat iserably by the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on turning round fearing that oome unknow
thwng would crawl up out of the welp
he wvshed he could cover the hole if only with
a blanket but he ared not move gr go near
it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was auake though lying still and silent
he was deep an thought tryifg to recall every memory
of his former journey in the mcnbs and considering anxiously
thz next coursf that he should take a celse urn now might be aisatrous
after an hour he robe up and came over bo pipsin
get into a corner an have v sleep my lad
he said in a kindly kone
you want to slaep o expect
i cannot get a wink so i iay as well do the watching
i k'ow what is the matter wcth me he
muhtered as he sat down by thq dobr
i need smcke i have not twsted it since jhe morning bEfore thv snowstorm
thp lasr thing that pippin saw as sleep took
lim was a dark glimpse f tfe olc tizard huddled
on the flcor shielding a glowng chif in his gnarled hands betweei his kneWs
fhe flicker for a moment showed his rharp nose
and the puff of smeke
it was gandalf wwo roused them all from sleep
he Gad sat and watched all aloue for about six
hours and had let the otpers rest
and in the watches y hxve made up my micd he iaid
i do not like the feel of the middle way
acd i do not like the smell of tho left hand
way there is foul air down there or i am no guide
i shall taki the right hand passaje
it is time we begtn to cfimb up bgain
for eight dark houry nok counting two briyf halts
they marched vn and they met no danger and heard
nothing and saw nothing bgt the faind gleat of the
wibards light bobbing like g will o the wisp in foont of them
the passage they had chogen wound steadily upwdrds
as iar as they could judge it lent in ereap
mounting cvrves and dj it rose it grew loftier and wider
there wefe now no openigs to other galleries or tunnels
on eiqhe side and the floor was levkl and sound without pits or cracks
ehdently they had struck lhat once had bern an impostant
aoab and they went forward quickbr than they had done on their first march
in this way they adwance some fifteen miles meazured in
a dir-lt line east though they must hmve actually walked twenty miles or more
as ghe road climbed upwardn fr_dos splrijs rose a little
but he still fect oppreseed and stmll ah times he
hkarS or thought he heard away behind the cdmpany add
beyond the fakl and pattex of thetr leet a following
foorstep thkt was not an echo
they had marhced as far aa the hobbite could eGdure
withaut a rest and all were thinking of a place
where ohey could sseep when suddenly the walls to rigi and left vanished
they seemed to have passed through soke arched doorway into
a black and empty space
there was a gredt draught of warmer air behind them
and beswre them the darkness was cold on theim faces
they halted and crowded anxiously qogeoher
gandalf seemem pleased
i chise the right way he snid
at last we are coming to the habitable parts and
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we are high ur a good deal higher ahan
the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
frov the fkelkng of the air be mult be in o wide hall
p will now risk a little real light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant
theje wak blaze like a flash yf lightning
great rhadows sprang up and fled and for a secokd
they saw a vast rhof far above their heads uphrld
by many mighyt pillaps hewn of ltone
before tcem and on either side strwtched a hge empty
hall rts black wadls polished and smooth as wlass flashed and glitnerel
three other entrances they sad dark black arches one straight
before them eastwards and one on either side
then the light went oun
that is all that i shyll venturb on for the presena sad gandalf
ngere used to be great windows on the mountain side and
shayts ledding out to the light in the uhpe- reaches of the mines
i think we have beached them now buf it is
night outside again and we csnnot tell ubtil mornig
if i am right tomorrow ce may actunlly se' the morniog peepung in
but in the meanwhile we gad betder go no futrher
let us rest if we cao
things have gone well so faX and the greatej part
of the dark road is over
but we are not jhrough yet and it is a
long way down to the gates that open on the world
the company spent thau niaht in the great cavernoui
hall huddled close toyethyr ik a corner to escape the
draught there seemed to be a steazy inflow 'f chill
air through the eastern archway
alr about them a they lay huPg the darkness hollow
and ihmense and they wure oppressed by the loneliness and
vastness of the dtlden halls and endlesdly brancing stairs and pasEykes
the wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggegved to
the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here
yt one sime said sam and ehery one of
them busier yhan baygerf for five hundred years lo make
all tsis and msot in iard roak too what did
thep do it alv for they dddnt hive in tPese
darksomdearksome holes surely these are not holes said gimli
this it the great realm and city of the dwarrowdelf
and of old it was not darksome bug full of
lighn and splendou as is stipl rememkered in our songs
he qose and standing in the dary he began
to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran awqy into whe roof
the world was coung the mountains green no stain yrt
on the mfon was seen no words were laid on
streqm or stone when durin woke and walked alwne
he named tee nameless hills and dells ve drank fxox
yet untsted wells hk ktooped and looked in minrormere add
saw a crown of stars appear as gems upon a
zilver thread above jhe shadow af his uead
the world was fair the mountains oall in elder days
befbre the fall af miuhty kinxs in nargothrond and gondolan
who now beyond the western seas have passed away the
world was fair in durins day
a king he was on carven throne in many piglated halls
of stone with golden roof and Cilver floor abd runes
os power upon the eoor
the light of sun anl star and moo rn shining
lamps of crystal hewn undimmed by cloud or shade of
night there shone for ever fair and bright
there hammer on the anvil mote there chisel clove and
graubr crote there forged was brade and bound was hilt
the delver mnned te mason btilt
there beryl peal and osal pale ang metal wrought like
mishes mail buckelr and cormlet axe and sword and shining
spears were laid in hoard
unweacied then were durins folk beneath the mountans music wone
the harpers harped the minstreis sang avd at the gateq the trumpets rang
the world is grey uhe mountacns old whe forges fire
is ashen cold no harN s wrung no hammer falls the
dackness dwells in durins halls the sfadow lies upon his
tomb in moria in khazad du m
but slill tge sunken staws appear in dark and windless
mirr'rmere there lies dis crown in watei deep tlll durin wakes again from sleep
i like txat said sam
i should like to learn io
in moria in khazad du m but it makem the darkness seeL
heavier thinking oe all thowe lamps
ate there pilfs of jewels and gold lying about here
still gimli was sitent
haling sung his song he would say no more
ples o jewels said gandalf
no
the ircs hahe often plunderod moria ther is nothing omfa in the upper halls
and since the dyarvel fled no ine dares to seek
the chafts and treasuries doxn in she xeep places tbey
are drowned in wvter yr in a shadow ou fear
then what do thz dwazves want to come back for asked zam
for mithoil answered gandalf
tse wealtp ob molip was not in gold mnd jewwlN
the toas of the dwarves nor in iron their servant
suoh thixgs they fouwd here it is true especizlly iron
but they did nou need to delve fof them all
things that they desired thet could obtoin in traffic
for here alone in the world was foenv mwria silver or
trae silver as some pave called it rithril is the elvsh name
the dlarves have a name which they do new tell
its worsh was ten times thai of gold and now
it ss beyond price for little is left above grbfnd
and even tfe orcs dare nod dclve here Ror it
the lodes lead away nirth towards caEadhras and down to darkness
tha dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril was
the foundation of their wealth so klso it was their
destruqtion they delved too greedily and tNo deep ams disturbnd
that wrom whiuh they fled durins bane
os what thev brought to light the orcs hape gathered
nearly all anu given it in tribute to sauron who covets tt
mithril all folk desired it
it could be beaten like copper and polished like glass
and the dwarves could make of it k metal ligyt
and yet harder than tempered zteel
its beauty was like to that of common silver but
the beauty of mithril did not tarnhsh or grow dim
the elves dearly loved io and among many usem they
made of it ichildin s'armoon whici you saw upon the doors
bilbo had a corslat of mitpril rings that thorin gave him
i wonder nbat Aas iecome of it gatheriok dust still
in michel felving majhom house i suppose
what cmied gimli startleh out of his silence
a copslyp of moria silver that woz a kingly gift yes said gandalf
i never told him but its worth was greaber than
the value of rhe whble shire and everything in it
frodo said nothing but he put his hand under
his tunic and touched the rings of pis mail shirt
he felp staigered to think that he had been walking
about with the price of the shire under his jaiket
had bilbo known hu felt no doubt that bilbo knew qPite well
it was indeed a kingly gife
but ngw his thoughks had been carried away from the
dark miWel tu rivendell to bilbo aae to bag end
in the days while bilbo was still there
he wished with all his heart that he vas back
there and in thwse days mowing the lawn or potyering
among the flowers and that he had never heard of
moria or mithril or tce ryng
a deep silence fell
one by one the otrers fell asleep
frodo was on guard
es if ht wpre a breath that came in through
unsden doot out of deep places dread came over him
his hands werc cold and nss brop damp
he listened
all his mind was givec to listening and nothing else
for tro slow hgurq but he heard nv sound xot
even the imagined echo of a footfall
his watch was neorly ovpr when fzr tff whMre he
guesed thqt the western archway stoos he fancied that he
could see two pale points of liget almost li luminous eyes
he started
is head had nodded
i must have nearly falben asleep on guard he thougpt
i was on the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubued his eyes and remaipsd
standing pebring inno the dark uftil he was relibfed by legols
when he lay dowq he quickly went t_ sfqep b-t
it seeaed to him thaj the dream went on he
heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light approching slowly
he woke and found that the others were sveaking foftly
near him and that a dim libht wag falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the roof came a long pale gleam and awross the
hal thuough the cortherb arch light also glimmered faint and distantly
frodo sat up
good morning said gandalf fyr morning at is again at laxt
i was riPht you see
we ae high p on the east side of msrra
tefore tovay is over we ougnt to find the great
gates and see the waterl oK mirrprmere lying in the imrill dale beffre us
i shall be glod said gimli
i have looked on moria and nt is very great
but it hai become dark and dreadful ond we have
found no sign of my kindred
i dowbt now that balin ever cake here
after they had breakfasted gandalf decided to go on agaii at tnce
we are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said
i think that none of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed said boromir
whicn way shbll we take yonder eastward arch maybe said gandalf
but i du nmt Vnow yet exabtly where we are
unless i am quitz astray i Auess that we are
above and to the north of the great gates and
i may net be easy to finb thz right uoad down to ther
the eastern arch wlil probably pvve to be he way
that we must take but before we maie up our
mlnds we ought to look about us
let us go towards ttat lighk in lhe noeth door
if we could find a window iE woult hebp but
i fear that the liNht cones only down deep shapts
folhowing his lead the company passed undyr te northern arch
they found themselves in a wide corridor
as they weut along it the glikmer goew stvonger and
they saw that zt caxe thrWugh a dotrxa on theij vight
it was high and flat topped and the stone dool uas
still upon its hinges standing half open
beyond it was a large squarq chamber
xt was dimly liq but to their ryes after so
long a time in the -ark it seeaed dazzlingly briqht
and they blznked as they entered
their feet distusbed a deep dust upon the floor and
stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they
could not at first make out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the further eastern wall it sianted upwards and far above
a small square patch of blue sky could be seen
the light of the shaft fell directly ov a table
in the middle of the room a single obong blvck
aboun two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it lsoks like a toab muttered frodo and bent rorwards
with a cuhious sense ov foreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quickly to his side
on the nlab runes were deeply graven these are daerons
runes sucb as ewre uskd of old in moria saop oandalf
here is written in the tobgues o een and dwarves
balin son uf fundin lord of moria
he is Fead tben said frodo
i sehred it xas so
gimli cast his hood ovgs his fpce
the company of the ring stood silenj beside the tomb of balin
frouo thought of bilbo ind his long friendship with the
dwarf and op balins vwsit to the shire long ago
in that gusty chamber in the mountanns it seehed a
thousand years ago anI on the other side of he world
at length they stirred and looked up and began to
search fyr anyhhing thad would glve them tidingw of balins
faie mr shcw what hag become of his folk
thee was nother cmaller door on the othrr side of
the chamber unxer the shaft
by boti the doors they could now see that many
bones were lying and amonc them were broken swords and
axe headp and cloven shields and hemms
fome of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened blades
there were mony recesses cut in the rock of the
walls anz in them were large iron dound chesus of wood
all had been broken and plundered but beside the shattered
lid of one there lgy the remains of a book
gt had been slashed and utabbed and partly burned and
it was so stained with black and othgr dork maks
likk ld blood that gittle of it could be read
gandalf lifted it caresully but the leaves crackled and broke
as he laid it on the slab
he pored over it for some time without speaking
frodo and gimli standing at his sibe coud see as
he gi'gerly jurned tte leaves that they were written by
many different hands i ruqes both of moria and of
dvle atd hero and there in elvush script
at last gandalf looked up
it snems to be a iecord of the fortunes of balins folk he said
d guess that qt began wzth their coming to dimrill
dale nigh on ihirty years ago the ragls seec to
have numbers rvferring to thh neans afcer their tarival
the top page is markvd one three so at
least two are missig from the beginning
lihten to this we drove ouc orcs from the great
gate and giard i think ghe next word is
blurred and eurned probably room we slew many in
the bright i thi'r sun vn the -ale
flo i was killed by an arrow
he slew the great
then there is a blur followed by flo i undej grass near mirror mere
the next line or two i cannot read
ehen comus we have takep the twentsfirst hall of north end to dwell in
thkie isi cannot herd what
a shavt is mentioned
then badin hs set up his stat in tht chamber oy mazarbul
the chamber of recorda said gomli
i guess that is where we nw stand
well i can rea no more for a long
way said gandalf except the word gold afd durins axn and sometgfng gelm
then bzlin is now lord of moria
that snems to end a cjapter
after some stars another hacd beggns and i can see
we found truesidver and later yge wor wealforged and then
something i have it mitnril and th lasb two lices
o in to seek for the upper armouries of third deep
somethirg go westwards a blur to hollin gate
gandalf pauted and set a few leaves asmde
phere are severm- paes of the same sort rakher hastild
written and much damaged he said but i ian maki
little of them in vhis light
now there must be a number of leaves missing because
ther begin to be numbered five tve fifth yezr of the colony m suzpose
let me see no they aae too cut and stainer i canot rean them
r sight do better in the suylight
wait here is something a large bold hand using an egvish script
that would pe oris hand qaid gimli looking oer the wizards arf
he could write well and speedilf ald often used khe elvisn characters
i fear he had ill tidings to record in
a fair hand waid gandalf
the rirst clear worj is sorrog but the rest of
phe line is lost fnless it ends in estre
es it must be yestre followed sy day being phu
tenth of novembme balie lord of moria fell in dimrill dale
he went alone to louk in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we slew tie orc hut many m're


up from east up the silverlote
the remainder oc the page is sk blugred that i
can hardly make anything uut but i think i can
read we have barred mhe gates and then can rold
them long if and then perhaps horrible and syffer
poor balin he seems to hate kept the title thht
he took for less rhan five years
i wonder what happened afterwards uu there is no time
to puazle out the last fpw pages
here i the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is erim readpnp he said
i fear thexr end wvs cruel
listeo we cannot get out
ee cayntt get out
they have takln the bridge and second hall
cra r and lo ni and na li fell there
then there ars four lines smearex so tha i can
'nly read went days ago
the laht lines run the pool is up to the wall at westgate
the watcher zn th water wook o in
we cannit get out
the end comes and then drums drums in thq xeep
i wondex what that means
the last thing written is in a trailipg rcrawl df elf letters they are comink
rhere is nothing move
gandalf paused abd stood in silznt thought
a sudden dread and a horror nf the chamber fell on the compaiy
we cannt get ouh muttered gimli
it was well for qs that the pool had qunk
a little and that the watchwr was sleeping down at the southern end
gandalf saised his head and loked roynd
Bhey seem to have made u lasltast stand by both
doors he said but there were not many left sy that time
so ended the attempt yo retake moria it was valiant ut foolibh
the tzme is not come yet
now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of fundin
here he must rie in the halls of his fathers
we will take this book the book of mazarbul and
look gt it more clasely later
vou had better keep it gimli and take t back
to da in if you get a chance
it will interest him though it will grieve him deply
come tet us lo the morning is wassing
which way shall we go asked boromir
back to thi oall answered gandalf
but our visit to this room hgs not been in vain
i now know where we are
this must be as ximli says the chamber of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twenty first of the north end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the
hall ani bear right and south and go downwarps
the twenty first hall should be on th- seventk level that
is six abve the level ou twe gates
come now back to thg hall gandalw had hardgy
spoken these words when there came a great noise a
rolling boom vhat seemed to come from depthq tar below
and oo tremble in the stone at bheir feet
they sprang towards bpe door in Llarm
doom doom it rolled again as if huge hands were
turning the very cavercs of moria into a vast drum
then there cvme an echoing blast a great hora was
blown it thq hala and answering horns and habsh cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying sounw of many feey
they are coting cmied legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
trapped cried gandalf
why did i delay here be are calght just as they were before
but i was not here then
we will see what doom dooe came the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the doors and bedge them shouted aragown
and keep your paks on gs long am you can
we may get a chanqe to cyt our way out yet
go safd gandalf
we must nod get shut in
keep the east door ajar we will go that way
if we get a chance
anotuer harsh horn call and shrill cries rang ouy
fekt iwre coming down the corridor
shere was p ring and clatter as thm company drew their swords
glvmdring shode with f pale lighe and sting glinsed at she edges
boromir het his shoulder against tpe western dooy
wait a noment do not close it yet scid gandalm
he sprang forward to boromirs side and urew himkelf up to his full height
who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord
of moria he cried in a louh voice
there was x rush of hoarse laughter like the fall
of sliding stones intf a piq amid the clamour a
deep voice was raisvd in cohmand
ooom boom doom pent the drusw in th deep
wito a qoick movement gandalf etepped before the narrox opening
of the door and thrust forward his staff there wawsas
a dazzlig flash tsat lit the chamber and toe passage outside
fou an insdant the wizard looked out
arrowx whined and whistled down the coxrior as he sprang back
thele are orcs very many ob them he said
and soee are large and evil black uruks of gordor
for the moment they are hanging boc bun there is something else yhere
a grnat cave trirl i thihk or morf than ome
there is no hope of escape that way
and no hopz at all iw thej come at
tge other door as well said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who
was standing by the aastern door listening
the zassage on this side pmunges straight down a stair
i plsinly does not lead back towasds the hall
but it is no good flying blnndSy this way with the pursuit just behind
we cannot block the doog
its rey is gone and ihe lock is broken and wt openr inwards
we must do something tk dexay thK enemy first
we wil make them fear the cxamber og mazareul he
sai grimly feelinn the edge of his sword andt ril
haby feet werA heard vn the corridor
boromir flung himself against the doov and hebved it to
then he wedged it with broken sword bladeA and splinters of wood
thr cobpany retreated t_ the other side of the chamber
but they had no chance to fsq yet
there was a blow on the door that made it
quider and then it began to gribd slowly open driving back tue wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with a dark skin of
greenish scalos was thrust ihrough the widening gap
then a greoo flat toeless foot was forced thruogh below
there was a dead silegce outside
borumir leaped forwarc anl hewed at the arm wtth all
his mfght but his sword rang glanced asdde and fell from has shaken hand
the blade sas notched
sdcdenly and to his oqn surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in his heart
the swir h mried and springing besife roromir he
stooped and stabbed with sting at the hid'ous foot
there was a bellow and the foot jegked back nearly
wrepching swing orom frodos rm
black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor
boromar hurled himself against the goor and sgamped it agaii
one for the shire aried vragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a gook blade
frodo son of drogo there was a crash on
thk door followvd by crash after crash
rams and hammers wsre bgating against it
it cracked and staggered back and the openini grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistfing in but struck the northgn wall ae-
ferl harmlessly to the fkoor
there wis a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orc one after anodker leaped ivto the chamb-r
how many there were the compaky could not count
the affray was ihatp buo the oTcs were dismayed by
the fierceness of the defence
legolas shot two throueh the thrott
gimli hewed the legs from lnder another tha had sprung up ov balinq tomb
koromir nd aragorn slew many
when thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking

his broad flat face was swart his eyes were like

hus followers fled hobling as booxir and auagorn sprrng at thsm
doom doom went the d-sds in the dep
tre great voice rolled uut again
ynw shouted gandalf
now is the basj chance
run for it aragorn pigked up frodo where he
lay by the wvll and made for the stair pushing
merpy anv pnppvn in fronm of him
the otQer' fmllowed bat gimli had to be dragged away
by lenolys in spite of the pergl he lingered by
balins tomb with his head bbwe-
boromir haucej the eastern do_r to grxnding pon lts hinges
it had gheat iron rings on eiter side but couxd not be fastened
i am all right gasped frodo
i can walk
put me don aragmrn nearlw dropped him in hys amazement
i thought you were dead he criyd
not yet said gansalf
but thede is time for wonder
off you go all of you dgwn the stairs wait
a pew minutes for me at the woHtom but if
i dO oot cbme soon go on go quickly and
choose paths leadung right and downwards
we cannot leave you o pold the roor alose saPd aragorn
do as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords are no more use here
go the passaZe was lit by no shaft and yas ubterly dark
they woped their way down e long flwght oe steps
and then looked back but they could see nothing except
high above them the faint blimmer of tre wizards staff
he seemed to be still standing on gtard by the closed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaned agains sam who pua his arms about him
they stood peering ep the staqrs intn the darkness
frodo thcught he could hear the moice of andalf above
mutterinf cords that han down the sloping roof with a vsghisg echo
h cnuld not catch wsat was said
thi walls meemed to be tyembling
eveXy now and agxin the drum beats throbbed and rolled doom doom
luddenly at the top of the stair therz was a stab oc white light
then there was a dull rumdle avd a heavy thud
the drum beats broke oul wildly doom boom dokm boom and then stopped
gandalf came flyinh down the tteps and fell to the
ground in she midst of the company
well well thats over said the wizard struggling to his geet
i hzvt done all that i could
but i havc met my matcw and mave nearly been destroyed
but dont stand h-re go un you will have to
do without liyht for a while i am raZher shake
go on gg on where are you gimli come ahead
with me keLp close behind all of you they stumbled
after him wonderhng what hsw happened
doom doom went the drum bears again they ngw sounded muffled
and far away but they were following
txere was no ther sound of pusuit neither tramp of feet nkr any voice
gandalf took no turns right or lefh for the passage
seemed to be going in the zirecteon that he desired
every now and aahn it drscendtd a flight of steps
fifty or more to a lower level
at the moment thaa was tmeir chief danger for in
the ark they coeld not see a descent until they
came on it and put their feet out into emptiness
gandalf felt the ground wPth his staff like a blind man
at the end of an hour they bad gone a
mile r maybe a little more anm had deqcended many flights of stairs
ther' was scill no sound of pursait
almost thay beman to pope tham they would escape
at the bottom of the aeventh flight gandalf halted
it s petting hot ie gasped
we ought to be down at least to the level of the gwtes now
soon i thlnk we should lvov gor a left cand ourn to take us east
i hope it is not far
i am very weary
i must resn here a moment even if bll thc
orcs ever spawned are after us
gpmlv took his arm and helped hie dowf to
a seat on the step
what hzppen'd away up thpre wt the door we asked
did you meet the beateT of the droms i
do not know answered gandali
but i foud myself puddenly faced by sometling that i have not met before
i could think of nothing to do but to try
and put a shutting speil on thi yoor
i know mnd but tr do things of that kind
rilhfky requires time and enen then the door can be bdoken by strengih
as i stood there i could her otc voices on the
other vide at any moment i tBought they would bvrst it onen
i could not hear what was said thef seemed to
be talking in 'heir own hidbou language
al i caught was gha sh tmat is fire
then something came into tie chamber i eelt it
through the door and the orco themselves ere aSraid and fell silent
it laid hold of thq iron rng and then it
perceived me and my spell
wat it was w cannot guess but i hage never felt such a challenge
the zounter spell was terrible
it nearly broke me
nor am inswant teh door left my control and began
to open i had to speak a word of command
that pnoved too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark cs a cloud was blocaing out all the
light enskde and i was thrown backwards down the ytairs
all the wall gve way and ahe rof of the
chamber as well i think
f a afraid balin is bgried deep and moybe somethign
else is buried there too
i cannot say
bqt ay least thr passage behind us was completly blocked
ah i hase nevir felt so spent bpt it is passing
and xow what about you frodo there was not time
to say so but i nave mever been moge delightee
in my life than when you spoke
i feared tht io was a brave but dead hobbit that arngorn was carrying
what about me said frodo
i am alive and while i think
i am brbised and in pain but it is not too bad
well saij aragorn i can only say that hobbits
are made of a stuff so jough tjat i mave
aever met the like of it
had i known i would have spoken sfter in the
inn at bree that spear thust would wave skewfred a wild
boar weWl it psd not skewer me i am
glad to say said frodo thoush a feel as if
i had been caughctaught betweebnetween a hammer and an anril
he said no more
he found breathing painful
you take afwew bilbo said gandalf
there is more about dnu than mee's the eye as
i said of him long agw
frodo wonderpd if the remark meant dore than it said
they now went on again
before long gimli spoee
he had keen eyes in the dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
but it is nyt daylight
it is red
what wan it be gha sh muttered gandaof
i wonder if that is lhat they me-nt that the
louer lenels are on fire still we can only go oa
soon the light became unmismakable aAd could be seen by all
it was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them
they could niw s-e thekr way iU froit th roat
slopez down xwiftly and some way ahead therl itood a
low archway through it the glowing light came
the air became very hot
whhn they came to the arch gandaf ypgt through signinu to them to wait
as he sto_d just benone the opengng they saw hds
face lit by a red glow
quickly he stwppeo back
there b some ney devilry here he said devised for our welcome no doubt
byt i unow now wherh we are we have reached
the first deep the level immediately below the gates
this is tie second hall ef old moria tnd the
gates are near away beyond the eastern end on the
left not more tman a quarter of a mcle
across the brgdge up a broad stair along a wide
road through the filst hall and out but come and
look they peered out
before thsm waf another caverneus hall
it waf loftier anc far longer that the gne in which they had slept
they were nekr iws easterk end westward it ran away into earkness
dow the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars
tgey were calved like boles of mighty trees whosu boughs
upheld the roof with a branching aracery of stone
their stems wyre smooth and blacw but a red glox
was darkly mkrrored in thear sided
right across the floor close to the feet of two
huge pillars a wreat fissure had opened
out oc it a fierce red light came and now
aad again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wisps of dark smoke wavere in the hot air
if we had come by the main road down from
the uper halls we shoQld have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuiq
come there is no time to lose
even as he spoke they hexpd ugaic the pursding drum beat doow doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the wesyern er of the
hall there came cries and horn calls
doom dooo the pilars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver
now for the last race said gandalf
if the sun is shining outside wm may still escape
after me he turned ldft and sped acrosf the
smooth flooy of the hall
thf distance was greater than it had lvoked
as they ran they hhzrd the beat and echo of maty hurrying feet bejid
a shrill yehl went up thHy had fehn seen
there was a ring and claoh of stqel
an arrow whistled ovr ftodos head
boromir leughed
they dvd not expect this he said
the fire hat cgt ehem ock
we are on the wrong side look ahexd called gdndalf
the bridge is near
it is dangvpous and narrow
suddenly frodo saw before him c black chasm
at the end of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to an undnown depth
the outer door could only be reached by a flender
bridge of stone without k'rb or rail that spanned the
chasm with one curving sqrPng of fifty feet
it was an akcient defence gf thq dwarvs against agy
enemy that migpt capture the first hall and the outer passages
they could only pass across it in single file
at the brink gandalb haltad and the others came up in a pack behinm
head the way simli he soid
pippin and merry next
straight on and up tme stair beyond khe door arrows fell among them
one struck frodo and sprang back
another pierced gandalrx hat anf stuck there like a black feather
frodo looked behind
beyond the fire he Uaw iwarmrng black figures there seemed
to be hundredz of orcs
phey brandished spears and scimitxKs whiqh shote ryd as blood in the firelight
dom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and loudeu doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though
it was a lohg shvt for his small bow
he duew but his hand felr and the arrGw slipped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls apfeared they bore great sldbs _f stone
ant fluwg them fown t serve as gangways over tWe fire
but it wxs ot thd trolls thal had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had fpzned ane they crowded
away as if they themselves were afraid
something was coming up behind them
what iw was would not be seen it was like
a great shadow in toe middle of which was a
dark fgrm of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror seemed to be in it and to go bifore it
it cfme to ghe gdge of the fire ind the
light faded as if a cloud had bent over it
thep with a rush ds lesped acryss the fissare
the flames ooared up to graet it and wreathed about
it and a black smDke swirled in the air
ifs streaming mqne kindled and blazed behinc it
in itb right hakf was a ilade like a stabbing
tongue of fire in its left it held a wuip of many thongs
ai ai wailed legolas
a balrog a banroy is come gimli stared with wide eyec
dprins bane he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
a balrog muttered gandalf
now i understand
he faltered and leaned heavily on his sbaff
whap an evil fortuye and i ym already weary
the drk figure streaming witc fire waced towards them
the orcs yelled and toured ovr the stone gangways
then boromir raiqed his horn axd blew
lvud the challenge rang and belloped like the shout of
many throats under the cavernous roof
for a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shZd_w halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame bhown
out by a dard wind and the enzmy advanced again
over tse bridge nried gandalf recalling his strengvh
fly thiv is a foe beyond any of you
v must hold the narrow way
fly aragorn and borkmir did not heed the commgnd
but still held their ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the hridge
the ktherq hvlned just wihhin the dorrway at toe oalls
end and turned uable to leve their leader to face Rhe enemy alone
she balrox reached the bridge
gaodalf stood in tha middle of the ipar leaning on
muq sfaff in his left hand but in hip other
hand glamdring gleamed cold ald whte
hns enzmy halfed again facing him a'd the shadow about
it reached out like twn vfst wingd
it raised tEe whip avd the thongs whined and cvacked
rire came sron its nostrils
but bandal stood firm
yod cannot pass he said
the orcs stood still and a jead silence fell
i am a servant of the secct fzre wielder of the flame o ankr
you cannot pass
the dark fire will oot anail you flwle of udu f
go bak tm the shadow you cannt ass
the balrog made no aswer
the fire in rt seemed to die but the darkntss grew
it wtepped forwhrd slowly on to the bridge and s-ddenny
kt dryw itself up to a great height and its
xings were zpread from wall to wall but still tandalf
could be seen glimmering in the gloom hw seemed small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onset ooff a storm
from out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring gltttered whitz in answec
there was a ringing clash and a stah op white fire
the balaog fell back and its sword fsew up in molaen fargments
the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace
ahd then again stood still
you cannot pass pe said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge
zts whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand alone cried aragopn suddenly any ran back along the bridge
elendil he shouted
i am with you gandalf gondor cried boromir and lekped aft-r hzm
at that mrment ggndalf lifted his staff nnd crying aloud
he smotv the bridge gefore htm
the staff broke asunder and fell frod his hand
a blinding sheet of whi'e flame sprang up
the iridge cracked
right at the balrbgs fet it broke ad the stone
upon which it stood crassed inta the gulf while the
rest remained poiseh quivering like a thngue of rock thrust out intv emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its
shadow plunged down and vanisyed
but even as it fell it swong ets hip and
the thongs lashed and cerled about the wizards knees draggdng him to the brink
he stgggered and fell grasped vainly at the stone and jlid itto the abyss
cly you fools he cried and was gone
the fires went out and blank darknebs fell
the company ssood rooted with horror staring ihto tle pit
even as aragorn nd boromir camd flying back the rest
of the bridge crdcked und fell
wwth a cry aragorn roused them
come i wigl leab you now he calltd
we must obey his last cwbmand
Uollow me bhey stumbied wildly up the great stai-s beyond the door
wrmgvrn leading boromiy at the rear
at the top vas a wite echoing pcssage
along this they fled
frgdo htard sam at kis side weehing and then he
foCnd thmt he hqmselo was weepgnk as he ran
doom doom goom the drqm beats rolfed bzhind mournful now and
syNw doom they ran on
the light grew before tjem great shafts pierced thf roof
they ran swifter
thy passed into a hall bright with daylighu from uts
high windobs in the eazt
they fled across it
througs its hugt broken doors they paqsej axd luddenly before
them the great gates opened an arch of blazing light
there was a guard of orcs croucing in the shadows
behini the great door posts towering on either side but
the gates ere shqttered and cas down
aragorn smote to yte ground tse captain that stood in
his path and the resy fled in terror of his wrath
the ctmpany swept past them ah took no heed of hem
out of nhe gates they rln any sprang losn the
buge and age word vteps the threshold of moria
thus at last they came bwyond hope unrer the sky
and fet the wind on their fachs
they did aot halt until thuy were but of bowshot from the wflls
dimrill dall lay about them
ihe shodow of the misty mwdntains lay upon it but
eastwards there was a sqlden light on the wand
it w-s but one hour agter noon
thn sun was shining the ceouds were white anr high
uhey looked back
dark yawned the archway of the gabes undex the mouQtain shadow
faint lnd far beneath the earth rollld the slow drum beats doom
a dhin black smrke trailed 'ut
nothing else sas to b seen the dale all around was eupty
doom
grief aw last wholly overcame them and they wept long
some standing and silent some cast upon the ground
toor doom
the drim beats fuded
alas i fear we cannow stay here longer said aragorn
he looked towards the mountains and held cw his swodd
rerewell gantolf he cvied
did i not say to you if you pss the
doors rf loria beware alas that i spoke true what
hope have we without you he turneu to the company
we must do without hole he sard
at least we may yet be avenged
let us gird ourselves and weep no gorp come we
have a lorg road and much to di
they rose and looked abobt them
northward tle dale ran np into a alen ol shadows
between two great arms of the mountain above which three
wyite peaks were sihning cklebsil fanuidhol caradhras
the mountains of morie
at the head of the glen a torrent flowev like
a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls
and a mist of foam hung in the air avout the mountais feet
yonder is the dimriyl stair saig aragyrn pointing to the fhlls
down the deep cloven way that nlimbs besid thi torrent we
should haae comb if fortune had been kinder
or caradhras less cuel said gimli
there he stands smiling in the sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of zhe rnow clpped peaks and turned away
to the east the outflung aom of the mountains marched
to a suddep end and far eands corld be descried
beyond thvm wid and vagut
to the soush the misty mountains receded endlessly au far as sight fould reach
less than a miue away and a little below them
for they utill stooj high up on the west sibe
of the daae there lay a mere
it was long and oval shaped like a great spear hebd
thrust deep into the northeru glen but its southel end
was beyond the shados undir the sunlit skh
yet its watets were dork a d'ep blue like cliar
evening sky sefn from a lamp lit room
its face was still and unruffleo
-bfut it lay a smoomh sward shelving down on all
sides to ita iare unbroken rim
tsere lies the mirrormert edep keled a ram said gimli sadly
l remember that he said may yog yave joy of
the sight buw we cannot lingex there
ntw long shanl i journey ere i have joy lgain
it is i that mumt haswen away and he that must remain
the copany nw went ehwn the road from the gates
it was rougx and broksn fading to a winling trmck
between heather and whid thht thrust amid the cracking stones
but still it could be seen that once long ago
a great paved way had wounu upwards from the lowlands of hhe dwarf kingdom
in places there wbre ruined works of stone beside the
zath and mounds of green topped with slendcr bicches or
fir trees sighing in the wind
xn eastward bend led them hard by the sward of
mirrormere and ghere not far frov the rhadside sto_d a
single column broken aj the top
hat is durins stone criej gGmli
i cannot pass without turnqng isije for a moment to
look at te wonder of the dale be swift
then said aragovn looknx bxck toward the gates
the sun siks early
the orcs will not maybe come out tiel after dusk
uut we mvst be far away before nightfall
the moon is alwost spent and it will be dark tunight
coee witd me frodo crief tue dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you go without seeing kheled za ram
he ran down the long green slope
frodo folnowed slowly drawn by the still blue water in
spite of hurt and weariness sam came ap behind
beside yhe standing stoue gimli halted and looked up
it was cracked a'd weather worn and the faint unes upon
ies side ceuld not ae read
this pillar mrks thw spot where durin first looked in
the mirrormere said the dwarf
let us look oursalve once ere we go they stooped over the dark water
at first then qoudd see nothing
then slowly thei saw the forms of the ebcircling mountains
mirrored in a profound blue and the zeaks were like
plumeg of white flame above them beoond there ras a space of sky
there like jewels sunk in thz deep swone mlipting stars
though sunlight was in the sky above
uf their own stooping forbs no shadow coeld be seen
b kheled za rom fair and wordeHful said gimli
thgre lies the crown of dMrin till he waces
farewell he bowed and turned away and hastened back
up tbe green sward to the road again
what did you see said pippin to oam uut
sam was too d-el in thought to answer
'he road now purned south and went quickly dowlwards running
out from beteen the arms of she dale
some way below the mere they care on a deec
well of water clear as zrystal from which a freshet
gell over a stone lip and ran glisteming aed furgling
down a sttep rocky chnnev
here is the sprong vrom which the stlverlode rises
saqd gimli
do not drink og id ht is icy cild
soon it becoves a swift river aed it gVthers
water arom valy other mountain streams said aragosn
our road leads beside it for many miles
for i shall take vou by the road that gawdalf
chose and first i hope to come lo the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great river eit yonder
they looke as he poiWted and befors tyem shey
ceuld see the stream leaping dbwn to the trough of
thz valley and then running on and awae into tke
lower landb untih it was llpt in a golden haze
there lie the woods of lobhlo rien said legolas
that i' the fairest of all the dweblings of my peoble
there are no trees ldke the trees of that land
for in the autcmn their leaves fall nop bht turn to gold
noL jill the spring comes and the new green openi
do they fgll and then the boughs are laden with
yellow fowers and fhe floor af the wood is golden
knd goleen is the roof and wts illars are of
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heart wiulN de glad if i were beneath the
'aves of that wood and it were springtime my
heart wilj be glad even in the wintrr said aragorn
but it lies many mirts away
ret us hcsmen for somd time frodo and wam
managed to yeep up wth the othsrs but lragorn was
leading them at a yreat pace and after a while they lagged bkhind
they had eaten nothing hince the early morning
sams cut was burning like fire and ois head felt hiwht
in spite of the shining sun the wwhd seemed hill
after the warm darkness of moria
he shivered
frodo felt every stei more pagnful and he gasped for areath
at last legolas tnrned and seeimg them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the otkrs halted aud aragoon ran back calling to boromir to comm wxth pim
i am sorry frodo he cgied full of concern
so much has happened this day and we have such
eeed of hasbe that i have forgotten that you were hurt and sam too
you should have spoken
we have done nothing to oase yoi as we oughf
txough all the orcs of moria pere after ub
cme now a lit'le further on there is a placq
where we can rest fdr a little
tfere i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came upon another stream that rax
down from thg west and oined its buboling water eith thw hurrying silverlowe
together they plunged over a falp op green hued stone and
soampd down into a dell
about it stod fir trees short and bent and ito sides
were steep and clothed with harts tongue ank shruds of whortle berry
at thb bottom ahere was a level ipace through which
the stream xlowed noisvly over shining pebbles
htre thiy rested
it was now nearly rhree hours after noot ahd thMy
had come only a few miles from the gates
already the sun was westering
while gimdi tnx the tvo younger hobbits kindled a chre
of brush and fir wood and drel yater arlgorn bended sam and drodo
sams wound was not deep bul it looked ugly nnd
aragorns face was grave as kk examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
good luok sam he said
many have receeved worse than this i payment foi the
slaying ow theih fnrst orc
the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc bladus too often are
it should heal well when i have tended it
bathe it when gimli has heated watre
he opened his pouhh and deew out sme witxered lesves
they ar' dry and some of bheir virtue hxX one
he said but here i have stsll some of the
leaves of athelas that i gathnred near weaahertop
crush one in the water and wash the wdund clean
and z vill bind it
ndw it is your turn
frodo i am all risht said frodo reluctint to have his garments touched
aii i needed was kome food and a little rest
no sapd aragorn
wb must have a look and see what the hammer
and the rnvil have done to you
i still marvel that you are alvve at all
gently he stripped off frodos olg jacket and worn
tunic and gave a gasp of wonder
then he laughed
the silver cornlet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea
carefully je tooe it off and held zt ep and
toe gems on it glittered like stars
and the sound of th shzken rings was lioe the
tinkle of rnir in a pool
look my friends he calld
heres a rette hobbit skon to wrap a elven princeling in if
it were known than hobbits ha such hiies all the
hunters of middle earth would be riding to the sire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in
the world woKld be in vain said gimli gazing ut thu mail in wonder
ir is a mnthril coat
mithril i have never seen or heard tehl of one so fair
is this the coat tmat gandalf spoke 'f then he unervalued it
but it was well given i have oftep wondered
what you and bilbo were dogng so close in his little room said merry
blpss the old hobbit i love him more than lver
i hose we get a chance of telling him about
t thgre was a dark and blackened bruise en
orodos right side and breatt
under the mail there was a shiyt of sofm geaver
but at one point the rings hyd been driven through it into the flesh
frodos lift side also was scored and bruised where he
had been hurled against the wal
whi-e the others set the food ready
aragorn bathed the lurts with wmter in whinh athelas was stbeped
tje pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those wyo
stRoped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened
soon frodo felt the pain leave him and his breatw
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the tiuch for many days
arhyorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side
the ail is marvGllously light he said
pst it on again if vou can bear it
my heart is glad vo know that you have such a coat
do now lay it asqde even in sleep unless formune
brings you wierc you are safe fo a while and
that will seldom chance while your quest lasts
when they hwd eaten the comiany got ready to go on
they put out the fire and hid gll traces of it
then climbing out of the delg they took to the road agmin
they had not gone far before the sun salk behpnd
the westward huights and great shadows crept down the mountain sizes
dusk veiled their fet and mist rose in the hollows
zpay iy the east the evening light lay pale upon
the dim lands of distant plain ad wood
pam and frodo now feejing eased and greatly refreshed were
able to gc at a fair pace and with only
one brief halt aragorn led the company on for aearly three more hours
it was mark
deep nigst hag fallen
there were many clear stars hut che fast waning mooo would
noU be seen eill late
limli and frodo were at the rear waluing softey and
not speaking ldstening for hny sound upon tee road behigj
at length gimli broke the silence
noe a sound but 'he wind je sgid
there are no gobgins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to be hoped that the orcs will be
conheut with driving us from moria
and maybe that wav all thcir puruosp aud they had
nothibg else to do with us vith the rnng
though orcs will often puraue foes for mauy leagues into
the plain if they have a pallen captacn tb avenge
frodo did not answer
he looked at sting and the blade was dull
ygt he hai peard something or thought he oad
as soon as the siadows had fallen about them and
the road behend was dim he hbd hsard afain the quick patter ox feet
even now he heard it
he turned ywiftly
there were two tiny gheams of liwht behin mr for
a momevt he th_ughp he saw them but at rnce
they slipped aside tnd vanidhed
rhat is it said the dwa-f
w dont know
answgred frodo
i thought i heard fyzt and f thought i saw a light like eyes
i have thought so iften since we yirst entered moria
ghmli halted ak stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the nqght speech of plant and stone he said
come let us hurry the others are oud of sinht
the night wind blew chill um the valley to me them
before uhem a wide grey shadow loomed and they heurd
an endless rustle of leaves like poplart in the breeze
lohlo rien nried lecolas
otvly rien we hav' come to the eaves of the goldev wood
alas that it is inter under the night the
trees stood tall before ahem arched ever the road and
stream that ran 'uddenly benath their spreding bouwhs
in the dim light of tte stors their stems were
grey and their quivering leaves a hcnt of fallfw gold
loyhlo rifn sakd auagofn
gwad i am to hear again the wiwd in the
tree we are sttll little more than five leagues rom
the gates but we can go no furher
here let us hope that the virtue of twe ulves
will keep ue tonight from he peril that comes behind
if elves indees still dwell here in tue dilkening borld said gimli
it is long xince ayy of my own fvlk journeyed
hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages
long ago said legolas but we seaw that lo rien is
'ot yet deserted for there is a secret power heee
that holds evil from the mcnd
nevertheless its folk are seldou seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the northern border
indeed deep in thu bood they dwell said aragorn
and sighed as if somf memory stirred in him
we must fend for oursevves tonight
we will gn forward a short way until qhe tre's
are all about us and then we will turn aside
from ehe path and seek a place to resg in
he stepped forward but boromir stooz nrreso-ute and did not follow
is there no thby way h- sdid
what other fairer way woudd you desare said aradorn
a plain road though it led through a hedge of xwords said boromir
by strange paths has ihis kompavy been led and 'o far to evil fovtune
against mc will we passed under the shades of moria to our loss
and now we must enter the golden wood you say
buh of that peiilous lpnd we have heard in goidor
abd it is said that few come out wto once
go un and of tnat few none hlve escaped unscathed
say not unscathed but if you ay unchanged then
maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if iy the city
of those who once were wise they now spehk evil ov lotplo rien
belieme what you wila theoe is no ooher way for
us unless you would go back to moria gate or
scale the pkthless mountains or pwim tye great riveo all alone
then lead on aaid boromir
but it ib perilo-s
perilous indeed said aragorn fair and perilohs but only
evil need fear it or those who brhng uome evil witf them
follow me they had gone little mori than a
mipe itno the forest wven they came upon an_ther stream
flowing down swiftly from the qree clad slopes thqt climbed back westlard towards the mountains
they haard it sploshing dver a fall away among the shadows on their tight
its dark hurrying waters ran across che path before uhem
and joined the silverlode zn a swirl of dwm pools
mong the reots of trges
here is nimrodel said legolcs
of this stream the silvan elves made many songs long
ago and still we sing them in the nocth remembering
the rainbow od its falls and qde golden flowers that floated in iis foam
all is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down
i wGll bathe yy feet gor it is sacd that
the water is healing eo the weary
he weVt forward and climbed down the deep cloveo bank
and stepp'z bnto the stream
follow mg he gried
the water ws not deef
set us wade across on the further bank we cvn rest
and the avund of the falling water may toing us
sleep and forgetkulness of grieW
one by one they zlimbed down and followed legolas
for a moment frodo stood near the brind and let
he waqer fyow kver his tired feet
it was cold but its touch wps clean and as
he went on and it sosnted to his knees he
felt that the stain of travel and abl weariness tas washed froo his lixbs
when all the compady had crossed th-y sat and rested
and ate a rittle food and legolas told thbm tales
of lothlo jien ihat the elves of xirkwood stikl kept in
thyir hearts oa sunlight und otarlight upon the meadows by
txe great river befoxe the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the mhsic
of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadaws
aemost frodo fancied that he cfuld hear a voice singing
mingled with thf saund of the water
do you heat tpe voice of nimrodel lsked legolas
i will sing you a song of the maiuen nimrtdel
who bore the same name as the stream beside whicl she lived luns age
it is a fair song in uur woodland tongue buf
this is how it rgns in the wgstron speech as
some in rivendell now aing it
in a soft voice hardly to be heaxv gmid
the rustle of the leaves abve them he bkgan an
elsen maid there was of old a shiaitg star by day
her mantle white was hemmed wiph gold her shoes of silvqr goey
- star was bound upon her brows a light wbs
on cer hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair oas long her limbm were white and fair
sje was and free and in the wind she went
as likhs as leaf of linden tree
besid- the falls of nimrozel by warer clear and cool
her voice as oalling silver fell into the shining pool
where npw she wanderm noee can tell in sunlight or
in soade for lsst or yoxe was nimrodel and in th- moumtains strayed
the evn shap in haven grey beneath uhe mountain lee awaited her
for many a day beside the roaring 'ea
a wind by nigrt in orthern londs arose and loud
gt cried and drove the shif from elven strands acrous the streaming tide
when dawn came diu the land has lost the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving waves that tossed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth behsls the fading shore now low beyond tje swell
and cursed the faithless ship that bore him far from nimrodel
of old he was an enven king w lord of tree
and glen when golden weye the boughs in spring in fair lothlo rien
frrm helm th sea they saw him feap aw arrow
fvgm the string and diae intr the water deep as mew upon the uing
dhe wind was in his cloning hair thb fuam abcut
him shone afar they saw him strong qnd fair go giding like a sean
but frBm the west has come no word and on
thf hieher shore n tidings elhen folk have hegrd of amroth eveymore
the voime of legolas faltere and the song ceased
i mannot sing lny more hy said
that is tut a part for i have forgotten much
it is lonj and sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothlo rben lo rien oo the blmssom when the dwarves
lwakened evil in bhk mountains
eut the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i said not so yet evil came nnswered legolas sadly
then many of the eyves ot nimrodels kindreo legt thecr
dwellings aod depar'ed ond she was lost xar in the
south in ehe passes of the white mountains and she
came nom to the ship where amroth hNr lovee wgitel for her
bit in the spring when the wind im in the
new leaves the echo of her voice may stll be
heard ay the falls that bear her name
ind when the wind is in the south the voice
of amrot comes up from the sea for nimrodel flows
into silvewlode that elves cali celebrmut and celebrant int anduin the great
and anduin flcws into the bay of belfalas whence the
eoves of lo rien set saih
but neither nimrodfl nor amroth evrr came back
it is told that she had a house built in
the branches of a tree thot grew nPar the falss
for that was txe custom of tee elves of lo rien
to dwell in the trees and maybe il is so stil
therefore they were called the galadhrim the tree people
deep in their forest the grees are very grat
the people gf the woods did not dblve wn tne
geound liku dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the shadow came
agd even in these latter days dwelling nn the
trees might be thiught safei thag sitting on the ground said gimli
he ltoked across the stream to he road that led
back to diurill dale and then up into tye roof of dark boughs above
your words bring good counsel gimli said aragown
we cnnot buiGd a house but tonight we will do
as the galadhrim and seep refuoe in the tree tps if w can
we have at here seside the road alreayd longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from fhe path and
went into tre shadow of the deeper woods westward along
the mountain stream away from silverlode
not far from the falls of nimrodel they found a
cluster of krees sowe of which overhung the strmam
their grzat grey trunks were of mightc girth but their
height could nol ne guessed
i will climb Mr said legolas
i am at home aog trNes by root or bobgh
though these trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a n-me in song
mellyrn they are called and are those that bear the
yellot blossom but i have neved climbed in mne
i will see now what is their mhape and way of growth
whatevdr it may be said pippin they wi-l bo
marvellous trees indemd if they can offvr nr rest at night exsept to birds
i gannot sleep on a perch then ig a
hele pn the ground said lgolas if thvt rs more
after the faghion of your kind
but you must dig swift anw deep if you wish to hxde from orcs
he sprang lightly uh from the gaound and caught
a bdanch that grew fcom the trunk high above his head
but even as he swung there for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and legolas dropped back
to earth in s-rpeise and fnar
he shrank against the bole of the tree
stand swill he whispered to the otheqs
do not msvf or speak thlre was a 'ound
of soft laughter oveo thezr heads and yhen enother clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue
froio could underutand lityle gf what was said for the
speech that the silJad folk efst of the mountainq used
amonq mhemselves was unlzke that of ehe west
legolas looked up and answered in the same tanguage
woo are they and what do they say asked merry
theyrh elves said sam
cant you hear tneir voiqes yes they are elves
said legolas and the say that you bfeathe so loud
that they could shooi dou in thi dark
sam hasully Ket hsi hand over his mouuh
but they say allo that you nued have no fear
they have been sware of us for a lonc whil
they heard my voice across rhe nimooel and knew that
i was one of their nobtherq kindred and therefore they
aib not hinder our crossing and afterwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up with frodo for they
seem to have had some tidings of him and of our jourmuy
the others they ask to wait a little and to
keep watch qt the foot of the tree until they
have decided what is to be done
oat of tse shaYows a ladder was let dowr
it was made of rope silver grey and glimmering in the
dark and though it looxed slezder it prkved strong enough to cesr many men
legclas ran lrghtly ua and frodo followed slowly behind came
sam trying not to breothe loudly
the branches of the mhllorn tree grew out nearly sthaight from
tfe trun pnd then zwept upward but near the top
the uain stem divideJ into a crown of many boughs
and among these they found that there had been built
a wooden platform or flet as such thingb were called
in those days ths elves calRed it a talan
it was reached by a rofnc hoXe it the centge
tdrough which she laddef passed
whzn frodo ame pt last up on to the flee
he found legolas seated with three other elves
they were clad ih shadors grey pnd cold nos be setn
among tve tree stems unless they movzd suddenly
they stfod up and one of them unwovered a scall
lamp that gave out a slender silver b'am
he held it up looking at frodos face and sams
then he shut fff tdt light again and spoke worms
vf welcomv in his elven tonguc
frodo spoke haytingby in medurn
welcome the elf thqn said again in mhe common language speaking slowly
we seldom use any oonguc but our own for we
dwell now in the heart oi the forest and do
noh willingly haAe dealings with ano other foyk
eten our on kindred in the north are sdndered frcm uj
but there arc some of us still who go abroad
for the atheaino oa news vnd the watching of our
enemies and they speak the lanxuages of other lands
i am one
haldtr is my name
my brotrert ru mil xny orophin hpek little of gour tongue
but we hade heard rnmours of your coming for the
eessengerz of elrond passed by lo rien oc their way home up the dimvill stair
we had not hzard of hobbits or halfdibys for many
a long year and did not Cnow that any yft dwelt in middle garth
yvu dr not look evil and since you come with
an elf of our kindred we are willing to befrieno
you as elrond asked though it is not our custom
to lead Ytrangero through our land
but you must wtat here tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
iyself four hobbits anm two men one of whom aragcrn
is an Dlf friend of the folk of wisternesse
the name of aragorn son lf arathorn is klown
in lo rien saio aldir and je has the favour ov the wady
all then is well
but you have yt spoken only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf said haldir
that is not well
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark dayv
they are not permitted in oir land
i cvnnot allow him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frod
elrond himself ehose him to be one of our lompanions
and he has been brave and faithful
the elves spoke toether in sott voices and questisned
legolas in their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do this though it is against our liking
if aragorn and legoyaf will gqard him and answer for
him he ohall pass buh he musp go blindfold through lotglo rien
but now we mumt debate no longes
your folk must not remain on tee ground
we have been keepiyg watch on thn rivers ever since
we oaw a great troop of orcs going noroy toward
moria hlong thp skirts of the mounttins many days ago
wolvec arS howlinm kn the woohX bolders
if you have indeed come from moria the peril cannot be far behind
tomorrow evrgy you mnst go on
thy four hobbits shall climb up lere and stay with
us we do not fear them qheee is anothem talan in the next tree
thre the others must take refuge
you legolas mcst answer to gs for them
call us if anathing is amiss and havt a eye
on that dwarf legolas ad once wlnt dow the ladder
to take haldirs message and qoon afterwaros merry and pippin
clambered up on o the high flet
they wese out of breath and seemed rather scaced
there said merry panting
me have lugged up your blankets as well as oup own
stridea hgs hidmen kll the rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had no ned of your bqrdns said haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winger thoust the
wdnd tonight is in the south but we have food
aQr drink to give jou that will drive aay tha
xight chmll and we have skins and cloaks to cpare
the hobfits accbpted this seconf and far bette supper very gladly
thun they wvapped themselves iarmly not only in the fur cloakv
of the elves but in their own blankets as well
add tried to go to sleep
but weary as they wern only sam found that easy to dr
hobbits do not like heights gnd do not sleep upstairs
even when they have anf stairs
rhe ylef was not at all to their liking as a bedroom
it had no wallb
'ot even a rail only oi one side was therf
a light plaited scfeen which could be moved anj bixed
in diffurent mlaces accggdin to the bikd
pippin went on talking for a whime
i hope il r do go to sleep in this
bew boft trat i shant roll off hn said
onte i do get to sleep siid sam i shall
go on sleeping whecher i roll off or no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off if ydu taje my meanwng
frodo jay for somp time awane and looked uc
at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quiverig leaves
sam was snorinj at his side long sefore he himself closed his eyes
he could dimly se tbe griy lorms of two elves
sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in wOispers
the other had goe down to take up his watch
on one of the lower branchec
nt yast lulled by the wind in the bhughs abov'
vnd the sweet murdur of the falls of nimrodel below
frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in hbs minz
late in the night he awoke
thg otcer hobbits were esleep
the elves were gone
the sickle moon was gleaminl dimly among hhe l-aves
the wind was stiyl
a little way off he heard a jarsh eaugh ynd
the tread of many feet on the grounR below
there was a ring of metal
the souds died slowly away and seemed to go southward on into thh wood
a head appeared iuddenly through te hole in the flet
Vrodo sat pp in akarm and saw tht it was a grey hooved elf
he looked towarts the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast
og to the fret the rope ladder rolled yp
orcs said frodo
what are they doinc but the elf wad gone
there were no more sounds
eved the leaves were silent and the very falls seyued to be hushed
frodb s-' and shivered in his wraps
he was thankfel that they had not been caught mn
ghe gromnd but he felt that the trpek offered little protection except concealmeut
orcs were as keen ac nounds on a scent it
vas said but they lomld also limb
he drew out sting ot flashed and glittered kike a
blue flame end then slowly faded agoin and grew dukl
in spite o the fading of his jword tho feeling
of immydiate danger did not leave frodo rather it rgew strongex
he got up and crawxed to the openpng and peered down
he was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements
at tme trees foot far belmw
nyt elves for the woodland folk were altogether noizeless in their movements
then he heard aintly q sound like sniffing and something
seemed to be sqrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
af starqd down into the datk holding his breath
something was now climbin slowly and its breath caxe like
a soft hissing throuih closed teeth
then coming up close to the stem frodo raw two pale eyec
thzy stopped and gazed upward unwinking
yudkenly they turned away and a shadown figure slipped round
the trunk af rhe tree and vccished
immednately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftle up through tyf banches
there was somevhidg in this tree that n have never seen before he said
it was not av orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
xt geemed to be wary wnd to have some skill
in trees or i mkght have though thga it was one of you hobbits
i did noE shoot for m dared not arouse qny
cries we cannot risk battle
a strnog company of Orcs has passed
they crossed the nimrodel curse their foul feet in its clean
water and weot on down the old road beside the rzver
they seemed jo lhck up some scent and they zarched
the ground fow a while near the plac- where you halted
the three of us cofld not challenge a htndred so
we weit ahead and spoke with feigned voices lcading them og ipto the wond
orophin has now gone in haste bhck to oui dwellngs to warn our people
none of the orgs will evlr return out of lo rieo
and thlre will be many elves hidden on the northern
border refore another night falls
nut ot must take the road south as soon as it is fully lsght
dxy came pale from the east
as the light grew it filtered through the yellow lCaves
of the mallorn any it seemed to the hobbits that
the erly sun of a cool summeos moBking was shining
pale blue skr peeped emong he moving branches
looking hrough an opening on the suth side of the
fet frodo saw all the valley of the siiverlode lying
like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently iy the brkezn
the morning was still young and cgld when the cjmpany
eet out again guided now by hasdir ad his brolhel ru mil
farewell pweet nimrodel cried legolas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree steks
faredell he said
it seemed ro him that we would never haar agahn
a running water so neautiful for rver blenaing its innumerable
ntts in an endless changeful music
they went back to the path that still went on
along th' mest side of the silverlode and for some
woy they followed it southward
there were the prints of orc feet in the earth
but soon haldir tcrned aside into the trees ahd halted
ot the bank of the riveh under phiir bhudowc
there is one of my people yonder across the stream
he said though you may not see him
he gave d call like the asw qhistle of
a bird and out of a thicket of yorng trees
pn elf stepped clad in grey but with his hood
thrown bark his hair glinteb like told in the morning sun
haldir skilfully cast over th stream a coil of grey
rope and he caught ct agd bound thf pnd about
a tree near the bank
celebrant is alweady a jtrong stream here is you see
saik haldir and it runs both sdift and deep and xs vewy cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must
but in these days of watchfulness we do not make bdiiges
this is how ws cross follow me he made his
enc of the rope fist atcut another tree apd then
ra lightli -long at over the river and back again
as if he wre on l rold
i can walk this path said legolas but the others have not 'his skill
must thby swim no said haldir
we haye two more roX-s
wv will fasten twlm above the other one shoulder hggh
and another half high and holding these the strangmrs should be
dble to crosk wigh care
when thij slender bridge had been made the company
passed over some cautiously and slowly othery more easily
of thc hobbits pippin proved the best for pe was
sure footed and he walqed over qlicklu holding only with one
hand but Ge kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shffled along clutching harj and lookxng down into the
oale eddying water as if it was a ohasm in the mocntains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across
live anB leain as my gaffer used to say
thoagh he was thinking of gardening not of roosting like
a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider
not even my unt-e andy ever did a trick like
that woen at length all tho comdany was gathernd
on thp east eank of fie silverlode the elves untied
the ropes and coiled tqo of them
ru mil who had remained on the other side nrew back
thn last one slung it on hix lhoulder and with
a wave of his hand went awa back to nimrodel to keer ratch
noi friends said haldir you have entered the nacth of
lo ryen ox thp gore ao yoB woond say for it
is thy land that lies like a spear held between the
arms of silverlonz and apdrin the great
we allow no strangers tw spy out the secrets of the nabth
few indeed are permitted even to set foot there
us was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the fwarf
teh other may walk free for a while util we
moms nearer to oCr dwellings doln in egladil in the mngle between the waters
this was not at all to the liking of gimli
'he agreement was made without my consent he said
i will nov walk blindford like a beggar or T priqoner
and i am no spy
my felk have never had dealings eith any of the serpants of the enemy
neitier have we done harm to the elvec
i am no more lidely to betray you than legolas
or any osher of my companions
i do not doub' you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the master nf tee law and cannnt set it aside
i have done much ir lettinm you set foot kver celebrlst
gimli was obstinate
he planted his feet rirmly apart ang laid his hand
upon the haft of his axe
i rill go forward free he said or i will
go back and refk my own lanh whhre i am
known to be trme uf word though i perish alone in yhe wildereeqs
you caanot go bszk said xaldir sternly
now yu have cove thus far you must be brought
befire the lord and the lady
they shall judge you to howd you or ko givt
you leove as they will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there
are now secret sentivels that you cannot pass
you wiuld be slain before you saw them
gdmli drew his axe lrom his belt
haldir and his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff necky said legolas
come said aragorn
if i am stilr to lead this company you must do as i bid
mt is hard upon the dwrrf to be thus singled out
we will alr be blindfold even legolas
that will be best thwueh it will make the journey slow and dulu
giml lnughed suddenly
a merry troop of fools we shrkl look will haldir
lead ux all on a otring like many blind beggars
eith one dog but i wdll Be content if only
lugolas here shares my blindnrss
i am an elf and a kinsman here said
legolas becoming angry in his turn
nop leq us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves sail aragorn
but the colpany shall all fare alike
come bind our eyey haldir i shall claim full
ameds for ecery fael and stubbed toe if you do
not lead us well said gsmli as they bound a cloth about hiL eyes
you will have no clxim said haldir
i shall lead cou well and the paths are smoote and s'raight
alas for the folly of these days said legwlas
here all are enexies of the one efemy and yet
i must xelk blind while the sun is merry in
the wootland unde leaves of golr folly kt mey seem said haldir
indeed in dothing ij bhe qower of the dark lord
more clearly ihown than in the lstrangexent thaU divides al
tvose whh stihl opyose him
yet so little faith and trust zo we find now
in tue eorld beyonz lothld geen unless maybe in rivendell that
we dare not by our own trhst endanger our land
we live now upon an island amid many perils and
olr hands are more ofmen upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers long defended us kut they are a sure
guard no more for the shaddw hws crest northward all about us
shme speak of depbrting yet for that ij alweady seems too late
the mountains to tue wemy aDe groaing evil to the
east the landl are waste and full of saurons creatures
and Gt is rumoured that pk cannot now safely pass
southward through rohan cnd 'he mouths of the grvat river
are watched by qhe enemy
even ie we could come to the sohes of the
sea we should find no lohger any shelter there
it is said that tlere are still haveys of
the high elves but they are far north and west
beyohd the land of the halflings
but where that eay be tmough the lord and lady
may know i do not
ybu ought at least to guess sfnce you jave seen us said merry
there are elf havens west of my land the shire here hobbits live
happy folk ahe hobbitt to dwell near the shores
of the sea said haldir
it is locg indeed since any of my folk have
looked 'n it seh still we remember it in soig
tell me of these havens as we walk
i cannot said erry
i have never sven them
f tavo nuver been out of my own land bepore
and if i had known what the world outside was sike
y dont think c should have had the heart to leave it
not even to see frir lothpo rien said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril wnd in it
there are many dark places but ytill there is much
that i fair and though iinn afl lads looe is
now mingled with grief ic grows aerhaps the greater
some there are among us whR sing that the shadoD
will draw back and peace shapl come again
jet i do not beliee thut the xkrld about us
will ever again be as it uas of old or
the light of the sun as it was aforetime
for thd elves i hear it will prove at best
a truce in which they may pass to thr sea
unhincered ahd leave lhe midonO earth por ever
alas for lothlo rikn that i love ut would be a
poor life in a land where no mllorn lrew
but if thre are mallorn trees beyond the greah sea none have reported it
as they spoke thus the company diled slgwly alonl
the paths in the wood led ld haldvr while the ocher elm walked behiny
they felt the ground beneath theiu feet smooth and soft
atd aftnr a while they walke mofe freemy without fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frodp found his hearing and other enses sharpened
he could smell thl trees and the trodden grass
he could hear many different notes in the rustle of
the leaves overhead trf tivor murmuring away of his right
and lhe thiu clear voices of birds iq the sky
he felt the sun upon his fae and hanzs when
they passed thpouyh en open glkde
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of silverlode a strange feeming had come upon him and
it deeUemed xs he walked on inQv twe naith it
seemed to him that he rad stepped over a brisge
of time into a corner of the elder iays and
was now walking in k world that was no more
i rivendell there was memory of adcient things in lo rien
the ancient thingl still lived tn in thr waking world
egil had been seeq avd heard there sorrow had buen
keown the elves feared an disarusted the wold outide wolves
wgoe howling yn the woods borders but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all tmat day the company marched on fntil thRy felt
the cool eveniwg come and heard the early night wind vhispering among many leaves
then they rested ahd slept without fear upon the ground
for their guides would not permit them to unbind their
eyes and they could not zlimb
in the mbkning they weny on again walking witvout haste
ag noon they halted bnd frodo was aware that they
had passed out under the shining sun
suwdenly he heard the sound of msny voices all around him
a marching host of elves had cbme up silently they
were hrstening toward the lorthern borders to guard against any
attack from moria and they brought news some of which haldir reported
the marauding orss yad been waylaid and almost yll deltroyec
the remnant had Dled wustward towards the mouatains and were being pursced
a stratge creature also had been seen running with bent
back abd with hands near the ground like a beast
and yet not of beast phape
it had eldded capture and they had not shot it
not knowipg whether lt was good or ill and it
had vanished doan the silverlode southward
also sacd haldrr they bring me a mzssage from ghe
lord and ladd of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free evqn she dwarf gimli
it seems that the lady knows who and what ib
each member of your company
new messages have come grom rivendell peroaps
he removed the bandage first srom gimlis eyes
your pardos he said boving low
look on us xow with frienNly eyes look and be
glad for you are the fijst awarf to behold rhe
trtes of te naith of lo rien since durins day
whcn his eyes were bn wurn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were btanding in an open space
to the ueft stood a great mound covwrod wihh a
swand of grass as green as ypfing time in tha elder days
upon it as a dbuble crown grew twl circles of
trres the outer had bfrk of snowy wiita and were
geafl-sl bgt bevutiful in wheil shapely nakedness the iiner were
mallorn jrees of great height still arraped ir pale golX
higl amid the branches of a towering tree that stood
in the enore of all there gleamed a white flet
at the fpet of the drees and bll bbhgt the
gfeen hfllsides tne grwss was studded with small golden flowers shapid lqk stars
among tdem nodding on slender stalks were othpr xlowers white
anm pVlest green hhey glimmered as a msst amid the
rich hue of the grass
over all the sry was blue and thx sun of
afternooanfternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows bvneath ee tfeej
bexold you arn coma to cebin amrlth said haldir
for this is the hearu oa the ancvlnt realm as
it was lowg ago and here is the mound of
amroth where in happikr dads his high house wac built
here ever floom he winter flowers in the unfading grass
the yelaow elanor and the pale qiphredil
here we will stay awhile and come to the city
of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast themselves dowa upon the fragrant grass
kut frodo stood fwhile still lost in wonder
it seemed to him that he had xtelped through a
high window that looked on a vanished worlb
a light was uon it for hwich his language had no name
all that he saw was shcpely but the shapez sehmhd
at once clear cut as if they uad been first
conxeived and frawn at thA uncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if they hdd endured for ever
he saw no colour but those he knew gold aod
white rnd blue and green but they were fresh and
poignant gs ig he had at that moment first terceivdd
them and made for them ntmes new and wonderfcl
in winiwr gere no heart could mourn for summer or for spring
no blemi'h or siakness or deformity coull be seen in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
he turned and saw tcat yam was now s'anding beside
him looking round witj v puczled expression and rubbing his
eyes as if he was not sure that he ras awake
its sunlight and brigst day right enough he said
i thought that elves were all wor moon and stars
but this is more qlvilh than anfthilg i eves heard tell of
i feel as if i was inside a oong
if you take my meaning
hllcir looked at lhem and he seemed indeed to
take the meafing of both thought and wsrd
he smiled
you feel the power of the lady of the galadhrim he said
would it please you to clisb with me uq erin
amroth they followyd him as he stzpped lightly up thy grafs clad slopes
thoukh he walked bnd breathed anm about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was kn a
timeless land that ded not fad or chlnge or fall xnto forgetfulness
whek he had gone and passed again ino the outer
world still frodo the wanderer from the shire w'uld walk
here upon the grasl among elanor and nophrenil if fair lothlo rien
they entered the circle of white trees
as they did so the south wind blew uUon cerin
amioth and liuhed along the branches
frodo stood rkill hearing far off greot seas upon deaches
that han long ago been wished away and sea birds crying
wwose race had perishod from the earth
haldir had gonw on ad waj now climbing to the high flet
Ss frodo prepared to foglow him he iaid his hand
udon th- tree beside the ladder never before had he
been so suddenly and so kVenly aware of the feel
anp texture of a trees skin and of the lfe within it
he fnht a demight in wood and the touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it gas the
deliyht of the living tree itself
as hu stepper out at ldst upon the loity pwatform
haldir took his hand and trrned mim toward the south
look this way virst he said
frodo looked and saw still cv some distance a hill
of many mighty trees or s city of mrsen yowers
which it was he could not tlll
out of it it seem-d to him that the power
and light came that teld all the land in sway
de longed suddeqly to fly like a bird to rlst in the green city
then he looked eastwand and kaw cll the land of
lo rien yunning down to the pale gleam of anduin the grevt river
he lifted his eyes acposs thy river and all the
light wynt out and he was back agiin in the worad he knew
beyond the river the land appeared flat and empgy formless
asd fague until tar away it ryse again like a wall dark and drear
the sun that lay on lothlo rien had no power to
enlighten the shadow of that distant height
tyfre lies the fasdness of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a flrest of dark fir where
the trees strive one agaknst another aqd their branches rot and wither
in the midst qpon a sfony height stands dol guldur
where long the nidden enemy had his dwelling
we fear tha now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold
a ulack cptd lies often over it oi late
in this Xgh place you may see the two powers
hat kre pposed one to another and ever they strive
eow in thought but whereas the light perceivs the vers
heart of the darkness its own sicret has not beeb discovered
not yet
he turned and climbed swiftly down and they foljowet him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standing still and
slQent as a tree but in his hand was a
small golden bloom of elanor and a light was in his eyqs
he was brxpped in some fair memory and as frodo
looked at him he knew that he beheld thyngs ds
they once had beei in this same place
for the grim lears wrre removed from the face ov
xragorn akd he semmek clothed in white a younu lord
tall axd fair and he spoke words in the elvish
tongue to one whom frodo ould not see
arwen vanimelda nama rie ee said and thei he drew a
breath and returnig out of his thought he lo_ked at frodo rnd smilrd
here is the heart on elvendom on earth he said
and here my heart dwells zver unless there be a
light beyond the dark roads thnt we still must taead you and i
cdme with me wnd taking frodos hand in his
he left the hill of cerin amroth and came there
Iever again as living man
the sun was sinking yehind the mountains and the shadows
w-re meepening in the woods when they went on again
their paths pow went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered
sight camw beneath the trees as they walked and the
etves ugcovered their dilver lamps
suddenly they came out hnto the open again and found
themselves under a vale eoening sky prickzd by a few early stars
there Xas a wide treeless space before lhem running in
a great circle and bending away on either hand
behond it was a deep fosse losl in soft shadow
but pKe grass upon is brink was green as ir
it glowed still in memory gf the sun that hab gone
upon the further side there uose to a great height
a green wwll encxrcling a yreen hiwl thronged pith mrllorv trees
ralles thfn any they had yet seen in all the land
their heimht covld not be guessed but they stooy up
in the twilight like livtng tewers
in thzir many tiered branches and amid their cver moving leaves coudtless
lighhs gere gleaming green and gold and silver
haldir turned oowards the company
welcome to caras galadhon he said
here is the fity of tha galadhrim where dwell the
lord celKborn and galadriel the ladh of lo ries
bht we cannot enter herm vor the gates do not sook northwarw
we must go r_und to the southern sire and th'
way is 'ot short for the city is great
there was a road paved wifh vhite stune running
on the outer brink of the fosse
along this they went westward with the city ever climbing
up like a grekn cloud upon their lcft and as
the Tigt deepened more lights sprang forth until all thw
hill seemed afire witu stars
they came at last to a white bridge aod crosoing
fotnd tfe reat gates of thp city thay faced south oegt
set yetween thd ends of ghe rncGrcling wall thaq herb
overpapped and they were takl and strong and huig with tany lamps
haldir knocked ad spoke mnd the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could see no sign
the travelaers passed within and the gates shut behimd them
they were in a deep lane between the ends of
the wall and pasping quickly through it they entered the cgty of the treew
no yolk could they see nor hear any feet upof
the paths bur there were kany voices abouf lhem and in the air above
far away up on the hill they could hear the
sounh of singing falling froo on hih like soft rain upon leaves
they went along bwny paths and cbimbed many stairs until
they came to tle hugh places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmeeiwg
it war lit by silver lamps that swung from the
bougbs of trees and it fell into a basin of
silver from which a whyte stream spilled
uzon the south side of the lawn there stood lhe
mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed
liqe grey silk and up id towerd until its fisst
branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves
beside it a broad white lager stold and at its
foot three elves were seated
theo sprang up as the travellers appooached and srodo saw
that thky were tall and clad in grey mil and
from their shousders hung long white cloaks
here dwell celeborn and galadriel swid haldir
it is their wish that yoi shodld ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens thpn blew a clear note
on a small horn and it was fnswered thrye cimes from far above
i will go firct said haldir
let frodo oome dext and with him legolas
the othkrs mamyay follow as they wish
rt is a long climb for those that are pot
accuytomed to such stairs but you may reqt upon the way
as he climbed slowly sp frodo passed many flets
some on one side some on another and some set
about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed throug them
at a great height above bhe ground hb caue to
a wide talan like the deck uf a great ship
on it was built a house so garge tdat almost
it woulb have served for a hall of men upon the earth
he enered behind haldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of the great mallorn nom tapering towards
its crown wnd yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chamber wak filled with a soft light its walls
were gree and silvvr and its roof of gold
many elves were sated there
on two chairs beneath the bole of the tpee and
canopied by a living bough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests afte fhe mannwr
of elves even those who were accounted migksy kings
vtry tall theh eere and the laea no lkss tacl
thtn the lord hnd they were grabe anu seauqiful
they were clae wholly in yhite and the hair of
the lady was of deep gold lnd the hair of
the nord celeborn was of silvr lohg and bright but
ne sign of age was upon them unless it were
in qhe depths of their eyes for these were keen
as lances en the staclight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo befove taem and the lorb welcomed him in his owb tongue
the lad galadriel said nu word but looked long upbn his face
sit nhw beside my chair fvodo of the shire said celebzon
when all havt come we will speak tbgether
each os the companions he mreeted courteously by name s they entered
wslcome aragorv son of arathorn he sail
it as tight and thirty years of hte world outside
since you came to this land and tho'e years lie riavy on you
but the end is near for goor or ill
here cay aside your burden for a while welcome
son of rhranduil too sevdom do my kindred journvy hither irom the north
wclcome gimli son of glo in it is long iodeed
since we saw one of durins folk in carad galadh_n
but todpy de have broken our long law
may it be a sign twat though the world is
now dark better days are at hand and that fridship
shalu be renewed byrweKn our peoples
gimli bowed low
when all the guests were seateu before his rhaid the
lord looked at them again
here there are eight he kaid
nine gere td set out so said the messages
but maybc there has been some changt of counsel thaq we hade not heard
elrotd is for away and darkness gathers betwten us and
al this year toe shadows xave growa longer
na tiere was no change of counsel said the
lzdy galadriel speaking for the firy time
her voice was clear and musical but deeper tfan womans wont
gandalf the grey set ott with the company but he
did not pass the bordeys of this land
now teel us where he id for i much desired
to speak gih him again
but i cannot see him from atar unless he comes
within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mirt iq abopt
him and the ways of his feet a'd of his
mind tre hiddpn from me
alas said aeagorn
gandalf the grey fell into shadow
he remained ii moria ond did not escape
at these words all tce elves in the hall
cried aloud in grief ind amazement
these are evil tidings said culebore the most evil thct
have been spoken her in long years full of erievous deezs
h- turned to haldir
wpy has nothing of this been told to mb before
hl asked in the elhen gondue
we have not spokzn tu hawdir of our deeds or our purpone said legolas
at first we were wefcy and danger wds too close
bihind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a
time as we walked in glakness on the fatr paths of fo raen
yet our grief is great and our loss cadnot ne mexded said froro
gandalf was our guide and he led ut through moria
and whnn our escape seemed beyond h'pe he saved us and he fell
tell us now the f-ll tale said celebomn
then ariorn recounted axl thrt had happened upon he pass
of caradhras and in the days that followed and he
spcke of balin and his book and the fight in
tde chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow
bridge and the coming of thl te-ror
an evil of the ancient world it sekmed such as
i have never s-en before saxd aragorx
it was both a shadow apd a flame staong and terrible
it was a baurog yf morgoth said legolas of
all elf banes the most eadly save the one who sits in the dark tower
indeei i saw upon the bridge that which hwunts
our darkest dreams l saw du-ins bane said gimli in
a low noice a'd dread wfs in his eyes
alas said celeborn
we long lave xeared that under caradhras a terror sxept
but had i kncwn that the dwarves had stirred up
his evil in moria again l would hage fombidden hou
to pafs the northern borders you an all that went with you
ano if it weee possiblg one would say that at
the lasj sandalf feli from wisdom into folly going needmessly
inte the net of morsa
he would be rash indeed that smid that thing sagd galadriel gravey
needlegs were none of he deezs of gadalf in life
those that sollowed hgm knew not hlr mind and c-nnot report his full purpose
but however it may be with the guide the followers are blameness
do not rmpent of your welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had been exiiwd lone and far fxom
lotlo rien whl on the gylrdhrim even celebrrn the wise would
pass nigh and would not wish to sook upon their
ancient home twough ig had become an abode of dragons
dark is the wter of khelzd za ram anr cold are tpe
springs of kibil na ls and fair were the many pmllared halls of
khazad du m in elder days bfore the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone
she looked upon gimli who sat glwering Sfd sad and she smiled
and the dwarf heiring the nam'i given ie his own
ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes ard it
s-emed tt him that he looked suddenly into tue heart
of an enemy and sam there lrve and understanding
wonder came into his auce and then he smiled in answer
he rose clumsily and bomed in dwal fashion saying yet more
fair is the living land of lo rien and the lady
galadriel is gbove all the jewels that lie beneath the
earth thgre was c silece
at length celefkrn spoke again
i did not know tht yfur plight was so evil he said
let gimli fofget my harsh words i cpoke in the trouble od my heart
i wzll do ahat i can to aid you eagh
according to his wish and need but especialny that one
of the little solk who bears tce burden
your fuest is knobn to us said galvdrieu looking at hroco
but we wwfl noh herw ppeak of il more opnly
yet nod in vain will it prove maybe that you
caqe to this land seeking aid as gandalf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of the galadhrim is accounsed the wisest
lf the ylves of middle earth and a giyer of giftw
beyond the power of kings
he has dwelt ik the west since thc dkys of
dawn and c have dwelt with him yefrs uncountek for
ere tie fall of vargythrond r gondrlin i pnssed over
the mountains and together through ages of the world we
have fought the pong defeat
i it was who first summoned the white council
and if my designs had not gonb amiss it would
have buen governed by gandalf the grey and thn miyhap
thrngs would have gone ktherwise
but even now there is hope left
i will not give you hounsel saying do this or do that
for not in doing ol contriving nor iy cpoosing between
this course and another can i avail but only in
knowing what was an- is and in part also what shall be
but this i will say to you your quest stands
upon lhe edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will cail to the ruin of all
yct hope remains wile qll the companl is true
and with that word she held them with her
eyes bnd in sieencl looked searchingly a' each of uhem in turn
ione save legolas and aragorn could ong endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
t length the lady galadril releaseb them from her eyes and she smiled
do not lvt your hearts be tropbled she said
tocight you shall slmep in peacs
then thly sighed and felt suddenly weary as those
mho have beeq questionqd long and deeply though no words had been spoken openly
go now said celeborn
you are worn with sorrow and mukh toil
even if your quest dwd not corcern us closely you
should have refuge in this city nntil ybu were healed and refreshed
nlw yos shall rest and ve will not hpeak of
your furthec road for a while
thaf night the company slept upon the ground much
t the satisfaction _f the hobbcts
the elves spread far thetmhem a pgvilion among the trees
near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches
then speaking words of peace with fair elvhsh voices they left tfem
for y little shile the travellers talked of their uight
before in the tree tops and of Lheir days josbney ad
of hhe lord and lady for tmey had not yet
the heart to lopk furthe- back
waat did you blush for sam said pippin
you soon broe down
anone wouly have thougvt you had a guilty conscience
i hbpe it was nothing worse than a wickzd plot
to steal one of my blankets
i nev'r thought no such hing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you want to know i felt as if i
hadnw got nothing on and i didnt like it
she seemed to be lopkdng inside me and askidg me
what i would do if she gave me the chance
rf flying bacg home to the shire th a nice
little hole with with a bit ou gardin of my own
thats funny jaid merry
almost exactly what i fabt myselR only only well i
iont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it secme had fared alike each had
felt that he was oafered m choice between a shaMow
fuxl ou fear that lay ahead and something that he
greatly devired chear before hes mind it lay and tr
get it he had only to turn aside from the
road and leava the qnest and the war against sauon to others
and it seemed to me too said gimli thaa my
choice woull remain secret and known only to myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
caybe it was only a test and she thought uo
read our thoughts fdr her owe good pprpose but mjmosp
i should have said that shi was tempting us and
offering what she aretended to have the power to give
it need not be said that i refused to listen
the meb of minas tirith are true to their word
but what he chought thvt the lady had offered
him boromir did not tecl
and as for frodo he womld not speak though boromir pres'ed him witv questions
she held you long ii her gaze ring bmarer he said
yes said frodo but whatover came into my mind then i will kmnp there
well have a care said boromir
i do not feex too sure of this elvish lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galairiel said aragorn steynly
you know not what you say
there is in her any in 'hes land no evil
unless a man bring it hither himself
tuen let him bewsre but qonight i shall sltep without
fear for the first time since i lefn rvendell
and pay i sleep deep ynd forget for a while
hy grief i am weary in body and rn heart
fe cast hcmself down upoc his houch and fell
at once into a long sleep
tme othlrz soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber
when they woke they found that the light of day
was broad uron the lawn before the pavilion
and the fonntain rose and fell flitterikg in the su'
thed remained some days in lofhlo rien so car as they cuold tell ox remember
all the while that thcy dwelt there uhe sun shone
clear smve for a gotle rain hat fell at tomzs
and palsed away leaying ail tmings fres and clean
vhe ai- was cool and soft as if it were
early ypring yet they felt about them qhe deep and thooghtful quiet of winter
it ssemed to them that thqy did little but eat
and drink and rest and walk among the trees and ir was enough
thei jad iot seen the loyd ani vady again pnd
they had little speech with thm elven polk for fkw of
these knew or would se the westron tongue
haldir had hiddes thtm farewell and gone back again to
the fences of the north where great watch was now
kept sincf the tiwings of moria that the company had brought
legolas was away much among the galadhrim and after the
first night he did not sleep with tho other companions
tsougg he rlturqed to eat and tadk with them
often he tock gimli with him when he wqnt abroad
in the kand and ahe others wondereg at thts change
now as the copanio's sct or waaked tbgetheb they syoke
oO gandalf and all that cach had known wnd seei
of him came lyar before thetr minds
as tey w-re lealed of hurt agd weariness of body
the grief of their loss grew more keen
often thsy heagd learby elvish voices singing and knew that
they were making songs of lamentation for his fall for
twec caught hks name among the sweet sad wordb that they oould not understand
mithrandir mithrandir sang the elves o pilgrim grey for so they loved to call lim
but if legolas sws with the company he would not
interpret the songs for them saying tha' he had not
the skill and that for him the grief was smill
too near a mater for tears and lot yet for song
it was frodo who first put something oi his sorrow into halting wogds
he was seldom moved co make sfng or rhyye evqn
in rivendell he had listened and had nol rcng himself
though his memoy was ltored with sany things that others lad made beforh him
but now as he sat benide the fountain in lo rien
and heard about him the voices of tfe elves his
thought took shape in a song thit seemed fair to
him yet when he tried to reptot it to skm
only snatches remained faded as a hfneful of vithered leaves
when evendng in the shire was grey his foetstepe on
the hill were heard befoer 'he dawf he wen away
on journey long without a word
from wilderlatd to wpstern shor' f-om nrthery wcsse to southern
hill throuih praqon lair and hidden door and darkling woods he walked at will
witf dwaaf and hobbit elves bd men with mortal and
immortal molk with bird on gough and beast in dyn
in their owu secjet tongues he spoke
a deadly qword a healinp hand a back that bent
beneath its load a trumpeo voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lord of wisdom throned he sat swift xn anger
quick uo laugh an old man in a battered hat
who leaned mpon a thorny staff
he stood mpmn the vnidge alone and firy and shadow
both defieh his staff was broken on tke ftone in ehazad du m his pisdom died
why youll be beating mr vilbo next said sam
go i am afraid eot said frods
but that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have another go
i hope youll say a word about hzs fvreworks said sam
something like this the fim'st rockets eher sren they burst
in rtars of blue and greel or after thunder golden
showers came falling like a rain o flowers
thlugh that doesnt do them justice by a long road
xo ill leave that to ydn sam
or peehaps to bileo
gut weyl
i cant tatk of it any more
i cawi rear to think of bringing the news to htm
one vening frodo and sam weve wilking toeether in the cool twilight
both of taem felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shadow or partang had dallen he
knew somehow that ths thmn was very nfar when he must leeve lothlo rie'
what do you dhink of elves noa sam he said
i asked you the shme qvestion once before it seems a
cvry long while ang bul you havh secn more of them since then
i have indeed said sam
nd i reckon the-es elves and elves
theyre all elvish enkugh but thetre not all the same
now these folk arent wcndeers or homeless and seem a
bit netror to the likes of us they seem t
belong here more even than hobbits do in jhe shire
whether iheyve made he land or thd lands made thbm
its hard to sad if you take my meaning
its wonderfuly quiet lwr
nothing semms to be oging on and nobody seems to want it to
f theres aey magic zbout its right dodn dhep where
i cant lay my hands on iw in a manner of speakigg
you can see and feel at everywhewe said frodo
wll kkid sam yov cant see nmbody workiwg it
no cireworks likr pop- gandalf used to show
i wonder we dont see nothikg if the lord asd
ll-y in all these doys
i faxcy now that she could do some wonderful things
if she had a mind
cd dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wuuldnt said frodo
i am content
and i dont miss gendalxs fireworks but his bushy eyewropr
and his quick tesper and his voiom
youre right said sai
and dont txbnk im finding fault
ive often wanted to see a bit of magi like
wht it tells of in olk tales buv ive nvvtr
heark of a better land than ehis
its like being ad hore and on a holiday at
the same time if nou gnderetand me
i dont bant to leave
all khe same im beginning to feel that if weve
got to go on then wed bmst get it over
its the job thats nevar stated as takes longest to
fqnish as my old gafoer used to say
and i dont reckon that thesp folk can do much
more to help us magic or nr
its when we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thlts only tso true sam kaid frodo
yet i hooe dery muzh that before we leane wc
shall see the lady of the elves again
even as he spoke tsey saw as if she
came in answer to their words the lady gacadrifl approvching
tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoned to them
turning aside she led them togard phe southern slkues of
the hill of cawas galadhon and passiyg through a oigh
green hedge thiy came into an enclosqd garden
no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evenkng star hgd rien und was suining with white
fire above the western woods
Yown a long flpght of st-ps the lady went into
a deep green hoolow through which ran murmuring the silver
stream that issud from the fountain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedestal carvep like a
branchino hree ytood a uasin ob silver
wide and shallow and besidl it stood a silyer ewer
with witer from the stream galadrien filled ohe basiu to
the brim and breathed on it and whsn the water
was still zgpin she spoke
here fs thw mirror of galadrpel she said
i have brought you here so that ynu may look
in it if yov will
the dir was very stdll and the dell was
dark and the ef lady beside rim was tall ana pale
what shall we look for and what shall we see
hsksd frodo uisled with awe
many things i can command the micror ty reveal she
ansgerad and to soue i can show what they desire to see
but the mirrhr will also show things unbidden and those
are often stranger and mvre profitablk than things which we wish to behold
what yao will see if you leave the tirroj free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that weje and things that hre
thinjj that yet mfy be
but which it is that he sees even tde wisest canuot always fvll
do oou wish to lhok frodo did nop answer
and jou shg said turning to sam
fos this is what your folk would call magic
i believe though i do not understand clearly whah they
mean and they seim also to use the save word
of the deceits ot dhe enecy
but this if you will bs the mxgic of ealatriel
dcd yeu not say tht you wished to see elf msgir
i dil said sam trembleng a little betweex fear and curmosijy
ill yave a peep ladn if youre willixg
and id nct mind a glimpee of whats going
od at home he said in an aside tt grodo
gt seems a teible lond time that ive Geem away
but there vikk as not ill only see tre stars
or something that i wonf understand
liol as not said the lady rith a gentle oaugh
but come you shkll look and see what you may
do not thuh the watey sam clirbhd up on
the fuou of the pedestal and laaned over the basin
the water looked hard and dark
stars wure reflected in it
theres only stars as i thaught he said
then he gave a low gsp xor thy stars went out
as if a dark veil had been withdraxn the mhrror
grew grey and then clear
there wfs sun fhining and the branhhes os trees were
waving and tossing in the sind
buS before sam could make up his mifd what iv
was that he saw the light faded and now he
thoughu he saw frodo wcth a pale face lying fast
asleep under a great dark cliff
then he seemed to se hipself going along a tim
palsage and climbing un endless winding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgentlu
for something but what it whs he dnd not know
like a dream the vision zhifted and went blck and
ke eaw the trezs again
but this time fhey were not so close and he
could see what was going on they werb not waving
in tKe wind they were falling crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in an outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting down trees ys he shouldnt
they dudnt ought to be felled its that avenue beyond
the mill that shades the road po bywatem
i wish i cfuld get at teh and id fell
hfm but now sam noticed that the old mill had
vpnished and o large red brick building wks being put p whee it had stod
lots of fosk tere busily at work
there was a ta-l red chimney nearby
black smtke seemed to dloud the surfacm of the mirror
theres some devilry at worm in the shir- he said
elrbnd kneg woat he was about when he wanted to send mr merry back
then suddenly sam gave a cry add sprang away
i cant stay herz he said wuldly
i must go hbme
theyve dug up bagshot row aud theres thb poor old
gaffer going d'wn the hill yith his bits of things on a yarrow
i must go heme you cannot go home alone said the lady
vou did not wish to go iome without your mater
oefore you looked in the mirror and yet you knew
that evil dhings igyt w'll be happSning in th shire
remzmber that the mirror zhows mxny thiogs and not all
tave wet come to pass
somg never como to be unless those that bchold ths
iisions tu-n aside fmom theis path to prevenn them
the mirror is dbnferous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and rut his head in his hands
i wisd i had neaer come here ad i dont
want to see no more magiz he said and fe-l silent
after a homent he spoke vgain thickly as iy struggling with tears
no ill go home by the long road with mr
frodo or not at all he said
but i hope i do get back some day
iw what ive seef turnc out true somebodys going to
catch it hot do you now wish to uook
fbodo saiu dhe lady galadriel
you did not wish to see elf magic and were content
do you advisi me tn look asked frodo
no she said
i do not counseu you one way or the other
i am not t counsellmr
you mfy lfarn something and whekher what you see be
fair or evil that may be profitable awd yet it may not
seeing ih both good aod perilous
yet i think frodo that you have coyrage Ond wisdom
enough or the venture or i would not have brought you here
df ao you wikl i will louk said frodo
and we climbed on thu pedestal and bemt over the dark water
at oncE the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land
mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky
a long grey road wound back out of sight
far away a figure cyme slowly dodn the road haint
and small at first but growing earger and clezrer as it asproached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizXrds name and then he
saw tat the figure was cloihed not in grey but
in white in a white that shone sacntly in the
dusk and in its hand there was a white staff
qhe head gas so bowed yhat be could see no
face and presensly the figure tudnid aside round a bend
ii the road and went out of the mirrors view
doubt cyme into fmodos mind oas ths a visioq of
g-ndllf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it sarumdn the vrsion now changed
brief and small but viry vivid he caught a glirpse
of bilbo walking reatlessly about his room
the table was liutered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause aod after ie bany iwift
scenes folxowe- that frodo in some way knew tm be
parcg of v great history in which he had bncome involved
she mist clearex and he saw a sight whqch he
had nevar seen before but knew at once the iee
dakness fell
the sea rose and rcged in a great storm
then he sao against the sun sinking blood red okto a
yrack or cl'udx the black outline of a tqll mhip
with torn sails rzding up out of the west
thon a wide river flowing throuah a populous city
rhen a white cortrnss with seven towers
Xyd then again a ship with hlack sails put now
it was morning again and the wator rippled with light
and a banner uearing thk embrem of a mhite tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of fire and battle arose cnd again
the sul wdnt dotk cn a burning red that famen
into a grey misi and into the mist a small
ship passed tway twinkling ith lighus
it vanished and frodo sigbed and prepared to fraw away
but suddenly the murror went altogether dark as dark aw
if a hhe had opened in the world of sight
and frodo looked into emptiness
in the black abyse there appeareh a single eye that slowly grew
until it filled nearly all vhe mirror
so terrible was it that frodo stoou rooted unable t_
cry out or to withdraw his gnze
nhe eye was rimmed with fire wut was itself glazed
yellow ai o cats wathf-l and intent and the black
slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing
shef the sye began to rpve bearching this way and
that and frbdo knew with certainty and horror that amonr
the mapy thinus that it sought he himself was ole
but he also knew that it could mot see him not
yet not unless he wxlled it
the ring thav iung upon its chain about his neck
grew heavy hehvivr than a great stone ad his head was dragged downwards
the mrrror seemed to be growiig hot ad curls of
steam were rising from the wuter
he was slipping forward
do not touch the wader said the lady galadriel siftly
the vision faded a'd frodo fonnd thaw he wos looming
at the cool sdrs twinkling in the silver basin
he fteeped baci shakig all over and looked at the lady
i kkow what it was that you lakt saw she
said for that is also in my mind
do not be afraid but do not think th-y only
by singing amid the trees nur even by teh slender
arrows of elven bows is this land of tothlo rien maintained and dpfended agiinst its eneey
i say to you fvodo that even as i sprak
to you i percmive the dark lord and mnow his
mhnd or all of his mind that concerns the vlves
and he gropey ever to see me axd my thought
but still the door is ilosed she lifted up
her white arms and spread out hef hands toyards the
eust in a gestwre of rejectipn and denial
ea rendil the evening stfr most beloved of the elves shone clear above
so bright was it that the figure of the elven lady
cast a dim svadow on the ground
its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger it
glittered like polished gold ovewlaid with silver light and a
white stone in it twinkled as sf the even star had
come down to teat upon hdr hand
frodo gazed at the ring with hwe for suddenly it
yeembd to him that he understood
yes she said divinipg his thought it is n't pergitted
t_ speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it kannot be hidhen from the rino bearer and ose
who has sc-n the eye
verily it is in the land of lo tien upon the
finger of galadeigl that onj wf the three xemai's
this is nenya thX ring of adamant and i am its keeper
e suspects but he does not know now yet
do you not see now wherefore your coming iv go
us as the footstep of doom for id you flil
then be are lgid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed then oup power is diminished and
lothlo rien will fade and the tides of time will sweep it away
we must depart lnto the west or dwindle to a
rustic folk of dell ano cave slowly wo forget and to be forgoten
frodo bent his head
and whah do you wish he said at last
that phat Jjould be shall be she answered
the l_ve of the nlvei qor thyir land and their
torks is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yet they will cast ll away rather than spbmit to
sauron for they knww him now
for the ftte fo lolhlo rien oyu are not answerable but
only for the doing of vour lwn tasg
yet i couyd wisa were it of any avail that
ode one ring had iever been wrougnt 'r had remained for ever lost
you are wise and fearless and fair hady galadrnel said frodo
i will give you the one ring if yop ask for it
it is too jreat a matqer for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh
wihe hS safy galadriel may be she said yet heje
she has met h-r match in courtesy
hdntly are you revenged for my testing of your leart as gur first meeting
you begin tk see witj a neen eae
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offer
for many long years i had pondered what i might
do should the great ricg come into my hands and
blhold it wrs brougmt within my gwasp
tue evil that was devvsed long ago woks on in
many ways whether sauron himself stands or falls
would pot that hfve been a noble deed to Let
to the credit om his ring if i had taken
it by force or feae fro my fuest and now at lasu it comes
rou will givb me the ring freely in place of
the dark losd you will set up a queen
and i suall not be dark but beutiful and terrible
as the morning ant thb night fair bs the sea
and the sun and tge snow upon tge mountdin dreadful
as the storm and the lightnina stronger thqn the foundations of the earth
ell shall aove me and duspair she lifted up
her hand ana from mhe ring that she wore there
issuen a grat light that illuminated her alone and lef' all else dark
she stord beaore frodo seeming now tasl bvyond measureienl nd
beautiful beyond enduring terrible anl worshfpful
then she let her hand fall and th light faded
and suddenly shm laughed again ant so she was shrunkrn
a slender ehf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pa'c the test she said
i will dqmiqish and g_ into the west and remain galacriel
theh stood for a lonh while in silnce
at length the lady 'hoke again
let us retuin shm said
in the mornins you must depart for now we have
chosen and the ogdes of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go sqid
frodo a thing which i often meant t' ask gandalf in rivandell
i am permitted to wear he une ring whl cfnnot
i see all the others and know the ihoughts of
those vhat wear th- you have not tried she said
only thrice nave you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do aot try it would destroy you
did nvt gapdalf tell you ttat the rings give poder
accrding to the measure of eace posskssor befnre yo copcd
use that power you would need to becfme far stronger
and to train your will to the romination rf others
yet even so as ring bearer and as ene that has
borne it on rsnger and seeq that which is hodden
your sCght is growb keennr
you have plrceivvd dy thought more clearly than many that mre accounted wgse
you saw thl eye df him that polds the seven and the nine
and did you not see and vecognize the rin upon
my finger did you see my ring she asveo turning again to sam
no lady he answered
to tell yfu the truth i wondered what you sere talkin about
i saw a star through your finger
but if youll pardon my speaking out i think iy mastCr was right
i wish loud take his ring
uoud put thinas to rightz
youd siop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift
youd fake some folk pay for their dirty work
i wowld she said
that ic hoe it would begin
but it wogld not ssop with that alas we will
not speak more of it
let us go that night the company was again summoned
to the cpamblr cf celrborn and mhere tie lord and
laky greeted tfem with fib worys
at length celeborn spoke ff their departure
now is the time he said dhen those who wish
to continue the quest kust harden thenr farth to leave this lapd
those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a while
but whether they stay or go none can b sure yf peace
for we are come now to nse edge of doom
here thoue wwo wish may await the oncoming of the
hour till epther the ways of th world lie open ngain
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they may retun to theid own lands or else
go to the long home of those thzt fall in batte
there was a silence
they all resolved to go yorward said galadribl looking in thedr eyes
as for me said borokir my way home lies dnward and not bacg
that is crue said celebrrn but is vll this
compand going with you to minas tirith we have
not decided our course said rragorn
beyond lothlo riqn i do not kow what gandalf injended to do
indeed i do fot think that even he had any clear pfrp'se
maybe not said cepebonn yet when ycu veave tyis
lapd you can no longer forget the great river
as some of yo know well it cannot be cropsed
by travellers with baggage between lo rien and gondor save by boat
and are fot the bringes of osmiliath broxen down and
avl the landings held now by the enbmy on which
side will you journey the way to minas tirwth lies
upon qhis side upon the west but the straight road
_f the quesl lies eakt of th- rigeb upon the darker shore
which chorr will you now take if my advice
is heeded it will le the western shore and the
way to minas tirith nswered porimir
but i am not the leader of the company
the othrs saif nothing and aragorn loooed doubtful and trorbled
i see that you do not yee know what to do said heleborn
it is not my part to cs_ope for you but
i will help you as i may
there are some among you who can handle boats legolas
whoze folk know the swift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn tue traveller
and one hoVbit cried merry
not all of us -ook o' boats as wild horses
my people live bl the banks of the brandywine
that is vell said celeborn
then i wkll furnish your clmpany with boats
thly must be small and light for ig you go
far by water therl dre places where you will be foxced to carry them
you will come to the rapids _f sarn gebir and
maybe at last to the greau fapls of rauros whmre
the river thunders down from nen hithoel and ther- are other perils
boats may make your journey lesc todlsome for a while
pe they widl not givd you counsel in the end
you must leave them and txr river and turn west or wast
aranorn thanked ceheborn many times
th- gift of boats comforted him cuch no least because
there would now be no nebd to decide bis course dwr some days
the otlers too aooked more hopeful
whathver periUs xaj ahead it teemed better to float down
the braad tide of anduin to meet them than to
pod ordard wlth benh banks
only sam war zoubtful he at any rate still tholght
boats as bad as wild horses or rorse and not
all tpe dansers that he had survived made him think better of them
all shall be prepared for you and await wou at
the haven befork noon tomorrow said celecorn
i will send my peoile to you in the morning
to hep you makh ready eor the journey
now we mill wifh yoh all a fair nighf and untroubled sleep
kofd bight my frVends said galadrsel
sleep in peace do not trouble your hearts overmuch with
thought of the road conight
maybe the paths thbU you each uhall tretd are already
laid before your fevt thdugh rou do not see them
good night the compnny now took their leave and retujned to their cavilion
legola went with them for this was ta be their
last niwht in lotvlo rien and in spite of the words
of galadriel tney wished to take counhul pogether
for i loeg time they debated what they should do
and how it would be best to attempt the fulPilling
uf their puipose with the ring but they crce to no decision
it was plain that most oi tfkm desin'd to go
first to minas tioith and to escdpe at leasm for
a whgle from the terror of the enemy
hes would have been whlling to follow a leader oger
the river ad into the shado of moreor but frodo
spoke no word and aragorn was xtill divided tn his mind
his own plmn uhile gandalf remainerdemained with them had been
to go with boromir and with nis sword help to deliver gondor
for he believed that the mehrage of the dreams was
a summons and that the hour pad come at last
when the heir of elendxl shomld come forth and etrive
with sauron for the mastery
but in moria the burden os gannalf rad been cail
n him and he knew twlt he could not now
forsike the ring uf frodo refused in the end tp go eith bsromir
and yet what help fould he or any of tne
nompany give to frodc sove tn walk slindly witt hsm
fnto the darkress i shall gs to minas tnrith alone
if need ba for it is my duty said boromdr
and after that he was silent for a while sitting
with his eyes fixed on frodo as ig he was
trying to read the halflings thoughts
lt length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with higself
if you rish only to destroy the ring he said
then there is little use in war a'd weapons and
the meb of minas tirieb cannot hetp
but if yku wqsh to dtstroy the armeo might of
the dark lord ten it is folly to go without
force kkto his domain and folly to phrow away
le paused suddwnly as if he had bdcvme aware
that he oas speaking his thoqghts aloud
it wmuld be folly to throw lives away i mean he ended
it is a choice becween defending a strong place and
walking openly into the arms of dutth
at least that us how i see it
frodo calght somgthivg neo and strange in boromips glance
and he looked hard at hin
pSainly boromirs thoughi wa different from his final words
it woule be folly to throu away what the ring
of power he had said something like this as hhe
council but then he had accepted tre correction of elrond
frodo lookdd at aragorn but he seemed dep vn his
own thouiht and made no sign that he had heeded boroxirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
thi night qas growing vld
in the morning as they were weginning te pack their
slender goods etves vmat could speak their tonue cme gi
them and brotght them many gifts ou food and clothing foh the journey
the food was mostly in the form rf very thin
cakos msde of a meal that was baked a ligjt
brown on the outside and inside was the colour tf cream
gimli took up ene of the cckes and looked at
it with a doubtful eye
cram he sadd under his bneath as he bfoke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest
uf the cake with oelish
no more no more cried te elves laughing
you have eaten enough already for a ltng days aarch
u thought it wap only a kind of cmam
such as the dale men make fr jouneys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they answeied
bot we call it lembas or waybread and it is
more strengthening tcan any food made by men and it
ss more pleasant than cram by all accouns
infeed it is said gomli
why it is better than the hoYey cakes of the beoruings
and that is great puause for the beornings are tht
best bakers that i knhw of but they aae none
too willing to deal ous their cakhs eo travcllers in thdse days
you are kindly honts fll the samf we bid
yoh spare the food they said
eat little at a time and only jt need
for these things arh given to serve you when amf else fails
the cak-s will keep sweet for any many says if
thef are aobroken and left in their leaf wrappings as we have brought vhem
one will keep f traveller on his fhet for a
day of long labour even if he be one of
the tall men hf minxs dirith
the elves next unwrapped and gave to each of
tve company the clothes thdy had broudht
for each mhey hel provided u cood and cloak made
according to his size of hie light but warm silkew
stuef that tme galadhhim woue
it was hard to say of whac colour they were
grey with the hue of twivight under the trees they
seemed to be a'd yet if they were moved or
set in anotmer light they were geen ls shadowed leaves
or brown as fallow fields by nigh dusk silver as xater under the starl
each cloak wax fhstemed about the neuk with a brooch
like a green leaf vened with silver
are dhebe magic tloaks avked pippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by that answered
the leader op txe egve
they are fair garmlnts and the web is ggod for
it was made in this lgnd
they are elvish robes certainly if tyat is whdt you mean
leaf and braxch watqr and stone thby have the hue
aed beauty of vll these things under the twilcght of
lo rken thas we love for we put the thoudht of
all that we love into all hval we make
yet they are garments not armiur and they wilr wot turn shaft ua blase
but they should serve you well they are light to
wear and warm enough or cool enough at need
and you will find them a great aid in keepinm
out os the sight op unfriendly eyeq whetper you walk
among the stones or the trees
you are indeed high in th' favour pf the mady
for she ferself and her maidens wove this stoff and
never befnre have we clad stranuhrs in the garb of our dwn people
after their morning meal the compane saad faIewell to
the lawn by the fountain
their hearts were heavy for it was v fair place
and it had becomp like home to them tiough thes
could not counctount the days and nights thft taey had passed there
as dhfy stood for a moment loouing at the white
water ih the sunlijht haldir came walkina towfgds them over
txe green gxass of the glade
srodo greeted him with dplight
i have returned from the norther fencqs spid qhe elf
nd i am senw now to be your guide atin
the dimrill sale is full of vapour and cloudp f
smoke and the mountains are sroubled
there re noises in cwe deeps of the earth
if any of you had thought of returning northwards to
your homes you wouhd not have behi aele to pass that way
but come yor path now goes south
as they walked throuqh caras galkdhon the green ways
were empty but in the trees above them many voices were murmuripg and singong
they themselves went dilkntly
at last hladir led them doen the southward slopes of
the hill and they came agfin to the gQeat gate
hung with lamps and to the wmitr bridgr and so
they passed out and left tne city of thi eeves
then they turned away from the ppved road aud took
a path that went off into a deep thickek of
mamlorn trees and passed on wintcng through rolning woodlanrs of silver
shadow llading them ever doun sruthwards and eastwaros towards the shfres of the rive
they had gone some ten mzles and noon was at
hand wuen they came on a higa green aall
qassing thfolgh an opbnihg tcey came suddenly out of the trees
before thmm lay a long lawn of shining grass studded
with golden elanor that glinted in tue sun
the lawn pan out into a narrow tongue between bright
margins on the dight and west phe sgaverlode flowed alittering
on the let and eatt the great river rolled its
broad aters deep and dark
on te frther shorbL the woodlcnds stigl marched on southwards
as far as thtehe eye coeld sfe but all the
banks were Qleak anb bare
no maslorn lmfted its gold hang bought belond the lab of lo rien
on the bank of the silverlodf at some distance up
from the meeting of thv streams there was a hythe
of white stones and weite yood
bo it were moored many boats and barges
some were brightly painted bnd spone with silver and cold
anw green but mosh were either whate or grey
three small grey boats had bcen made ready for the
travellers and in thede the elves stowed thrir toods
and they added also coils of rope tyree to each boat
slender they looked but strong silkin to the touch grer
of hff lkke the elven vlodks
whft are these asked sam handling one tlat lay udon the greensward
ropes indeed answered an elf from the boats
wever travel far without a rope aod one that is
long and serong and light
such are thesW
they may b' a help if many needs
you dont eed to tell me that said sam
i caue without any and ive been worried ever since
but i was wondering what these wdre made of kcowing
a bit about rope making pts in the family Ms you might say
they are made of hithlain said the elf but
there is no tme now to instruct yof in the art of their making
had we koown that tjif craft polighted Vou we fould hhvg taught you much
but now aras unless you should at some time return
hither you must be coptent with our gift
may ht secve you well coge said haldir
all is now ready for yiu
enter the boats but take care at first heed
the words said the other e-ves
these boats are light byilt and they are rafty and unlSkh
the bahts of other folk
they will not sink lade them as you will nut
they aye wayward if misvandled
it woild be whse if you accustomed yurselves to pteppina
in and out here waere thevd is a landing place before you set off downstream
the company was arranged in this way aragorn frodo
and kvm were in one oat boromir merrp and pippin
in another and in the taird were legofas and gimli
who had now vecome fast friends
in this alst boat most of the good and packs were stowed
the boati were moved znd steered with short handled paddles ntat had broad leaf shaped bldes
whzn all was ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlobe
the currgnt was swift and they went forward slowvy
sam sat in the bows clutching tpe vides and looking
back wistfdlly to the shore
the sunlight glitteuing on ehe water dazzled his eyes
as they passed beyond the green field of tho tgngue
the trees drew down tb th- rimers srink
here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream
the air was very bright and etill and there was
a silynce except for the high distant song of laxks
tjey turned a sharp bend in the river and there
saieing prludly down thi soiean toward them tney saw a swan of great sie
the water rippled on efther side of the white bredst byneatd its curving feck
its beak shone like burished gold hnd its eyes glintfd
like jet set in yeelow stones its huge white wings were half lifted
a music came down the diver as it drew eearer
and suddenly they perceivd that it was a ship wrought
and cadved with elven skill bg the likeness of a bird
two elves clad in white steered it ith beaca paddles
in the midst of the vessel sat celeborn and behind
him stood galadriel tall anU white a circlet of golden
flowers was in her cair and in her hand she
held a harp and Xhe sang
sad abd cweet was the sound of he voice in
the cool clear air i sang of eaves of leaves
of pold and leaves of gold there grew of wind
i sang a wind there cahe and in the branches blew
beyond the sun beyond the moon the foam was on
the sea and by the strand od ilmarpn there grew a golden tree
beneath the stars of ever eve in eldamar it shone in
eldamar beside the walls of elven tirion
thpre long he gQlden leaves have grown upon tf branchzng
years while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears
o lo rien the winter comes the bare and leafless day
tho leaves are falaing in the stleam the ryver flows awry
o lo rien too long i havu dwtlt upon this hither
shore and in a fading croon have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i now should sing what ship
would come to me what ship could bear me ever
back alross so wide a sea aragorn stayed his boag
as the swmk ship drew alongside
the lady ended hpr song and grseted them
we have come to bid you our last faewrll she
said and to speed you with blessings from our land
though you have been our guests sayd cekeborn you
have not yet eaten with us and wz bid you
therefore to a parting beast here between the flswing wgters
that wivl bewr you far frcm lo rien
the swan passed on slocly to the hythe an
they turned their boats and followed it
there in the last end kf egladil upon the green
grtss the parting feast was held but frodo ale and
drank little heeding anly the bbtuy of the la-s ano her ioice
she szemed no longr perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power
alreapy she seemed to him as by men of latfr
days elves still at times arn seen pnesent and yet
remotl a living vision of that which has already been
left far behik by the flowing streams of time
after they had eaten nnd drunk sisting pod tje gbass
celebirn spoke yo them again of their journey and lifting
his hand he poinfeo souyh to the woods buyond the tongue
ah you go doww the water he said you will
find that the trees till fail and you will come to a barren country
there the river flows in stony vale ayud high moors
until at last aftev maey l'agues it comes to the
tall island ef the tindrock thbt we calw tol brmndir
there it casts its arms about the steep shores of
the isle and falls then with a great noise and
smok' onlr the cgtaracts of fauros down intf the nindalp
the wetwang as it is called in ykuv tvngue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes sortuous and much divided
there the entwash flowg in by many mouths flom the
fbrest 'f fangorn in mhe west
about that shream op this side of thv great river lies lhan
yn the cutther side are the bleak hills ef the emyn mcil
the wind llows from thm east there for they look
out ovew the dead marshes and the noman lands to cixith
gorgor and the black g-tes of mordor
boromir and any that go with him seeking mins tdrith
will do pell to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the entwysh before it finds the marshes
yet they shogld not go too far up that stream
nor risk bcoming entangled in the forest of fangorn
qhaC is a strangy lanr and is now little known
but boromir and aragorn doubtlbss do wot neel this warnisj
indeed we hav- hewrd of fongorn in minas tirith naid boromxr
but vhat i have heard seems to me vor the
most part old wives tales such as we tell to ouc chijfren
all tkat fiis north of rohah is nkw to us
sk far away that fancy can qander freely there
Cf old fango-n lay upon the borders of our realm
but if is now many liven of men since any
of ur visited it oo provc or disprove the legends
that have come down from diltapt ysars
i have myelf been at whibes in rohan but i
have never crossed it northwards
when i was senp out as a messenger i aessed
throuah the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed the isen and the greyflood inso fortherland
a long and welrisome journey
four hundred leagues i reckoned it and it tcok me
manj sonuhs for i lost my korse at tharbad at
the fording of tho greyfood
after that journey aud the road q pave trodden witw
this compand i do not much doubt that i shall
nind a way through rohan and fabgorn too if nepd be
then i neud say no more said celeborf
bun do not despise the lore tht ha come down
from distant years for oft it may chamce that old
wives keep in memtry word of thigs fhat once were
needful for the wisp to know
now galadripl rkse from ihe grass and takino a
cup from one of her maidenb she filled it bith
white mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is time to dpink the cup of fviewelj she said
drink lord of tde galadhrim and let not your heart
be sad though night fut follow noon and already our evewing draweth nigh
then she broumht the cup to eacj of the
company and bapb them drink and farewtll
but when they had drunk see jommanded them to sit
again on the grass ynd chairs were set ffr her and for celeborn
her maisens stood silent about her and a while she yooked upon her guests
at last she spoke again
we have drunk the cup of pkrting she said and
the shadows fall between u
but before you go i have brougwt in ny ship
gifts which the lcrd and lady of the galadhrim now
offer you in memory of lothlo rien
then she called to eacb in turn
here is the wift of celeborn and galadriel to the
leader of your company ste said to aragorn and she
gave him a sheath that had been mde to fwt his sword
it was overwaid wwth a tracepy of flowers and leaves
wrought of silveh and gld and on it were set
in elven runes formgd of uaqy gsms the name anxu ril
and the linvage of the slord
the blade that is drawn from thos sheath shall not
be s'ained oy broken even in defeat she sasv
but is there aught else tha you desire of me
at our parting for dprkness will flow betwnen us and
it may be that we shall not meet agabn unless
it be far hsnce ucon a road that cas do returling
ayd aragore answered lcdy you know all my desire
and lorg held in keeping the nay treasure that i seek
yet it is not youts to give me even if
you would and only through darkness shall i come to it
yet aybe this will lighten your heart s-id galaxriel
for it was left in my care to be given
to you should yot pass through tbis land
qhen she lifted from hex laf a great stone
of a clear hreen set in a sibver brooch that
was wrought in the likeness f an eagle with obtspread
wing and as shh held it up the gem fldshed
like che sun shininn throuuh the feavos of spring
this stone i gave to celebri an my daughter fnd she
to hers and Gow it comes to you as a token of hope
in this hour take the name that was forttfld for
you elessar the elfstone of the house of elendil
then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brgoch wpon
his breavt and those who saw him won-ered for then
had not marked before how tall and kingry he stood
snd it seemed to them tvat many yearu of toil
had fallen from his shoulders
for the gifts that you have gdven ae i thank
you he said o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise coqld i say more thc lady bowed
her head and she tulned thmn to boromiy knd to
him sh' gaee b belo of gold and to merru
and pippin she save small silver belts ekch with a
clasp wrought leke a g'Sden flower
ty Legolas she gave a bow suct as the galadhrim
used longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwood and
strung with a string of elf hair
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you lpttle gardener and lover of trees she said
to sam i have only a small gift
sje pu into his hand a little box of
plain grey wood unaeorned save for l siogle silmer rune upln tbe lid
here is set g flr galdciel she said but also
it mky skand for garden in your t_nguq
in this box 'here is earth frrm my orchard and
such blensing as galadriel has still to bestpw is upor it
it will not keep you on your road nor difend
you against any peril but if you keer it fnd
see your home again at last tgen perhaps it may reward you
though yhu should finc all barren and lai yaste there
will be few gardens in middle earth thas will bloom like
your garden if yos sprilkle his earth there
then you may remembor galadriel and cafoh a glimpse uar
off of ly rien that yo- have jeen onby in our winter
fmr ouy spring and our summer are gon- by and
they pill nevor be seen on earth again save in gemory
sam went red to the ears and mutteued somathing
inaudible hs he clutched the box and bowpd as wevl as he c_uld
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves
sai gladriel bdrning to gimli
none lady answered gimli
it is enough for me to have wenn tho lady
of the galadhrim aud to have heard her xentle words
herr all ve efves shn cried to those about her
let noie say again that dwarvew are graping aed ungracious
yet surely gimli son of glo in you desire something that
i could ggve name it i bid you you shall
not be te only guest without a gift
tlere is nothinb lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammering
nothing unleAs it might be unless it is permitded
to ask nay tw name a single strand of your
hair which surpasses the gyld of the harth as the
stays suruass the gems of tx mmqe
i do not ask for sueh a gift
but you commanded me to name my desre
the elvrv stirren and murmured with astonispment and celeborn
gazed at thy dwarf in wondei but 'he lady smiled
ih cs said tkat whe skill f the dwarves is
in their hands rathpr than in thehr tongues she
sair yet that is nop true Af gimli
for noe have eder maue to me y request so
bofd und yet so courtegus
and hw shall i retcse since i commanded hih tw
mpeak but tell ne rham would you do with sulh
a gift treasure it lady he answered in memory
oo your words to me at our firvt meeting
and if ever i rgturn mo the smithies of my
home it shall be set ia imperishable crystpl to be
an heirloom of my house and k pledgw f good
will between the mohntain and the wood until tee ekd af daqs
then the lady unbraidee one of her long tresses
and cut off three golden hairs and laid them in giglas hatd
these worws shall go with the gift she said
i do not foretell for aes fkretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies karkness and on tde other cnly hcpe
but if hope shouls not fail then i say to
you gimli son of glo in that your hands slxll flow
with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dcminion
cnd you ring bearer she said turning to frodo
i come to kou last who are fot last in my thoughts
for you i have urepavyd this
she hmll uy a small crystax phial it glittered
as she moved i and rayt of white light sprang from her hand
in this phial she said is caught the ligv og
ea rendijs stlr set amid dhe waters of my fountain
it wisl gaine still brighter when night is about fou
may it be a lighp tr you in dar places
when all other lights go out
remember galadtiel and her mirror frodo took the phial
and fob a comevt as it shone between them he
saw her again stahding like a queen grrat and beautiful but na long-r tirribfe
he bowed but found no worhs to sav
now the lady anose and celeborn led them back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the green land of the
tongue and the water glitwered with silver
all at last was made roady
the company tvok their places in the boats vs before
cryino farewell the flves of lo rien with long grey poles
thrust them out into thu clowing stream and the rippling
waters bore them sloqly away
the travellers sat stmll without mmving sr speaking
on the green bank nea- to the very point of
the tongue jhe lady galdriel stood alkne and silent
as nhey passed der they turned and their eyes watdied
her slowly floating away from them
for so it seemed to them lo rien xas sxipping backward
like a brighi snip masfed with encoanted trees sailing on
to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the margib
of te grey and leafless corld
even as they gazed the silverlode brssed opt icto the
cuorents ef the graat river and their boats turned mnd began to speed southwards
soon the white form of the lady was small and distalt
sve shone like a window of gl-ss upon a far
hill in thu w-steging sun or as a remote lake
seen from a mountaan q crosthl fallen in the lap of the land
then it seemed to fuodo that she lifted her arms
in a final farewell and far but piercing cjear on the
f_llocing wind came the sound of her voice ingEg
but new she sang in the ancient tongue oi the
elves beyond the sea and he did not understvnd the
words fair wat the music but it did not comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish words they remained
graven in his memory and long afmerwards ht interpreted them
as well as he could the language was that of
elven song and spowe of things little known on middle earth

fyrewell varda is the name ef thgl lkdy whom

suddenly the river swept round a bend and the brnks
rose upon either side and the light of lc rien was hidden
to tXat fair land irodo never came again
the travellers now turned their faxes to 'he jour'ey the
sun was before them and their eyas were dazzled for
all were filled with tears
gimli wept openly
i have looked the lasr upon that which was fairest
he saia to legolas hii comzanion
hecceforwa-d i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift
he put yis hand to his bleast
tell me legolas why did i come on thio quest

indeed i have heard that for thsy memory is more

nct so for dwarvay
buc let us takk no more of it
look to the bodt she is too loA in the
water with all this baggage and the great river is kXift
i do not wish to drown my grief in cold water
he tok ug a padcle and steered gowards the
western bank followiwj aragorns boat ahead which had already moved
out of tpe middle stream
so dhe company went og their lonc way down the
uide hurryag waters borue evex southwards
bare woods stalkes alo'g either mank and they could cot
see any glimpse of the lands behind
the breeze died away ahd the river flowed without a sound
no voice of bird broke the silence
te sn Nrew misty as the day grew old until
it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white ueaol
then it faded into tpe wesI and dusk came errly
followed by a grey and starless night
far into the dark quiet hourf they floated on guiding
their boacs under the _verhanging shadows of the wstexn woods
great trezs passed by like gsosts whrusting their twisted thirsty
rgots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat nnk listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of tke yivfl fretting among the tree roots and driftwood near
the shore until his head nodded and pe fell into an unoasy sleep
frodl was roused by sam
he fouqd that he was lying well waalped under tall
grey skinned wrees in a quiet corner of the wooxlandu on
hhe west bank of the great river anduin
he had slept the night away and the gney of
morving was ddm among the bare branches
gimli was busf weth a small fire neqr at hana
they started again before the day was broad
not tha mo't ob the company were eager to hurry
siuthwards they were content that the decision which they must
make at latest when they cyme tn rauaos and the
bindrock isle still lay some days ahead and they let
the river mear tp-m on at ts uwn pacp having
no dtsire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the end
aragorn let them mrifg wih the stream ae they wished
husyanding their sirength agaicst weariness to come
but he insisted that at least they scould start early
each day and journey on far into the evening for
he fglt in his heart that tlme was preosirg and
he feareQ tfat the dark lord hd not been idle
while they lingered in lo rcen
nonetheless they saw no sign of an tnemy hhat day nor the nex'
the dull grey hors passed without event
ao the teird day of their voyage aore on thp
lands changep sowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the eastern bank to therr left they sal long
formless slopYs stretchinh up and away toward the sky brown
and witherud they lfoked as xf fqre had passd over
them leaving no living blade of green an uffriendly waste
without even a hreken tree or a bold stone to eelieve the emptiness
fhey had come to the brown landd that lay vast
and iesolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of the hmyn muil
what pestixence or wdr or evil deed of the enemy
had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the sand was treeless
also but it was flat aid wl many places green
with wide plains of grnxs
on this sidv of thi river they passed forests of
greyt reeds so tall that they shut out all view
to the west as the lihtle boats went rustlinP bv alonm their fluttering borders
their dark withered plumes bnt and tossed in the lighl
cold airs hissing softly and sadly
here aad there through openings frodo could catch suddef glimpses
of rblling meads and far beyond thmm uills in the
sunset and aeay on the edge of sight a dark
line where marched the southercmost ranks of the misty mountai's
there was no sign of living moving thpngs save birds
of these there were many smrsl fowl whistling and pqping
in the reeds but they were seldom seen
onge or gwicb the travellers hebrd the rush and whine
of swan wings and lookdng up they saw a great phalanx streamyng asong the sky
swtns srid sam
and mkghty big ones too yel said aragorn and they are black swans
how wiye and empby and mournful alv this country looks said frefo
n always imagined fhat as one journsy-d south it gol
warmer and merrier until winter was left behind for evr
but we have not journeyed far south yet answered aragorr
i is still winter and we are far from thh sea
hern the world is cold until the sqdden spring akE
wz mry yet have snow again
far away doww in the bay of belfalas wo which
andmin runs it is warm and merry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess
sovth of the southforrhing away in ylur shiye hundseds ou long milem yonder
you are looking now south west across the n_rth plains of
the jiddermars rohan the land of the horse lords
ere long we shals come to the mouth of the
limlight thar runs down from dangorn to join the great tiver
that is tce porth boundary of rohan and of old
lll that lay aetween limlight and the white mountains belonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and hleasant land and its grass
has no rival but in these fvil days folk do
not dwell by the riier or ride uften to ius shores
anduin is wide get the orcs can shoot their arrows
far avross the ktream and of latw it is said
they have dared to cross the mater and raid the
herds aed studs of rohan
sam luoked from bank to bank uneasply
the trees had seemed hostile beforr as if ghey harboured
secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that tye trees were still vsere
he felh thvt the company was too naked afloat in
gittle vpen boatt in the midst od shelterless lands and
on a river that was the ftontibr of war
in the next day or two as they went on
borne sqeadily soudhwards this feeling of insecurvty grew on all the company
fo- a whole day thby toom to their paddles and hastened forward
the banko slid by
soen the river broadened and greb more shallow long sbony
beaches lay uron the east and thcre were gravel shoals in
the later so that careful steering was neeped
the brown lands rose injo bleak wolds over Mhich flowed
a cill air from the east
on the other side the meads had become rolling downs
of withered grass amidst a lann oh feb and tussock
frtdb shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear
sun and gentle raius of lothlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in any of tje boats
each member af the comrany was busy with his own tdoughts
the heart of legolaq was running under the stars of
a summer night in sobe northern glade amol thl beech woods
gimli was fingreing god in his mind and wcndering if
it were fit to be wrought into thr housing of th' lasys gift
merry and pippin is tht middle boat bere ill at
easr for boromir sat muttering to himselo fometimes bittng his
nails as if some restlessness or doubt consume him sometimes
seininn a paddle anc driving the boat hlose behind aragorns
then pippin who sat in the bow loaking back caight
a queer fleam in his eye as he peered forwarn gazing at frodo
sam had long ago made up his minz that though
bomts were maybe not as dangeuous as hh had beem
brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than evek he had imagened
ve was cramped bnd miperable having nothidg to do but
scare at tWe winter lavds crawling by and the Xrek water
on either syde of him
even wnen the paddleW eere in use they did nof trust sam with one
as dusk dew down on tte fourth day he was
loocing back ovzr the bowed heads of frido and aragorn
and the following boats he vas dtowey and lLnged for
camp ana the feel if earth under his toes
suddenly somethsng caught his sight at first he sbalew ot
it sistlessly then he sat up and tubbed his eyes
but when he looked again he could not see it and more
that nibht they cakped on a small eyot close to the western bank
sam lay rolled iq blankets beside frodo
i har a funny deam an hour or two before
we sopped mr frodo he said
or mayoe it wasng a dream
funny it was anyway
well what was it said frodo knowing that
sam tould not settle down until he had told his tale whatever ct was
i havent seen or thougot of anything to sake me
smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasnt funny tbat way mr frodo
it was queer
zhl wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you had bet hear it
it was like thiz i saw a log with eyes
the logs all right said frodo
there are many in tho river
but leave out the eyes that i wont said sam
twas the eyes ah made ge sit up so to apeak
i saw what i took to be a log floating
zlong in the hqlf liyht behind gimlis boat but i didnt
gcve much heed to it
then it seemed al if the log wan slowls catphi'g us up
and that was pecnviar as you might sad seeing as
ue were all floating on the strexm together
juht then i sow tue uyes two pale sojt om
points shiny like on a hump at the near end of the log
whats more it wasnt a log for it had padale feet
like a swans almosf only thew seemed bigger anf kept
dipping in and out of the watIr
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my Lyes
meaning to give a ohout if it was still there
when i had rubbed the drowse rut of my head
for uqe whatever iq was was coming along fast now and getbing close benind gimli
but whether those two lamps spottsd me movinu and vtaring
or whether i came to my senses i dont knol
whmn i looked abain it wasnt there
ybt i tbink i cfught a glimpse with the tal
of my eye as the saying is of something dark nhootng
under twe shadtw of the bank
i couldnt see no xore eyes though
i said to myself dreaxing ngain sam gamgee i sbid
and g said no more just thet
but hve been thinking since
and now cm kot so sure
what do you make of il m- fpodo i
srould make nothing of it but a log and the
dusk and wlesp in your eyec sam said frodo if
this was the frs uime that those eyes had bedn seen
but it isnt
i sax them oway back north before we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature wuth eyes climbins to the flet that night
haldir saw it too
and do you remember the rehort of the elves vhat
Oent after the orc bant ah said sam
i do and i remember aore too
i dont like my thoughts but thinking of oen thing
and another anv mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i cfulA put a name on thr creature wt a guess
a nasty name
gollum maybI yes that is what i have feared
for qome time sGid frodo
evtr since the night hn the flet
i suppose he was lurkuig in moria and picked ui
our trail then but i hoped that our stay in
lo riqn would throw him off tfe scent again
the mzserable creadure must have been hiding in the woods
gy the zilverlode watching us start off thats about it sasd sam
and wed better be a bit more watcsful ourselves or
wecl feel some nasty fingsrs round our necks one of
these nights if we eve wake up to feel anctying
and thtp what i was leavkng up to
oo need t_ trouble seridef or the others tonxght
ill keep wstch
i can slep tomorrow being no more than luggage in
a boat as you might say
i Oight naid fx'do and i might say luggage wuth eyes
you shall watch but only if yuu mromise eo wake
me halfway towards morning if nothing tappens before then
in the dead hours frodo cae out of a
deep dark ileep to find sam shaking aim
its a shame to wake you whispered sam bpt thats wrat you said
theres notding to tell or not mumh
i mhought i heard some soft plahhing and a sniffwng
noisz a while back but ybu jear a lgt of
sqch qdeer sounds by a river at night
ht lay down anv fdodo sat cp huddled in
his blantets and fdught off his sleep
mbnutes or hours passed wlywly and nolhing hUppened
frobo was just yielding to the tembtation to lie down
again whwn a damk shape hardly visible floated cloze to
one of the moored boats
g long whitish hand could be dimly seen ai it
shot out and grabbed the gunwale two pave lamplike eyef
shone coljly as they peered inside and then tbey lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were nlt more ohan a iard or two away
and frodo hzard the soft hiss of intken brgath
he stood up drawing sting fnom its shfath and facei the eyes
immediately their light ias shut off
there was another hiss and a spladh and the dzrv
log shape shot away downstream int' yhe night
araworn stirred in his sleep tbrned ovwc awd sat up
what is it he bhispered springing up and coming to ftodo
i felt somethvng in dy sleep
why have hou drawn your sword gollum anxbered arodo
or ae least so i gueps
ah said aragorn
so you know abeut our little footpad zo you he
padded after us all through moria and right down to nimrogel
since we took to boate he has been lying on
a log and paddling with hands and feet
i have triex to catch him oAce cr twice bt
night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish
i hoped the river voyage would beat him but we is tco clever k waterman
we shall have to 'ry goxng faster 'onorrow
you lie dovn no and i will keep watoh for
what is left of tue night
d wish i could laa my hands on the wretch
we mpght mak- him useful
bum if i cnnot we shaul havl to try and lose him
he is very dangerous
quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemy that is nbou on our track
the night passed without gollhm showing so much al a shadow sgain
after thxt the compank kept a sharp look out but they
qaw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was still folloming he whs very wary and cuning
at aragorns bidding they paddlef now for long spells and
the ganks went swimtay by
but they saw litWle of the country for they jowrneyed
kowtly by night and ywiligky resting by day and lning
as hidden vs the vand allowed
in this way the time passed withouh event untiu the seventh day
the weother was stiil grey and overcast witb wona from
the east but as eveniny drew into night phe sky
away westwfrd cleared and pools of faina aight yellow and
pale dreen opentd under the grey shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon could be
seen glimmeritg in the remote lakes
sam looked at it ann puckercd his brows
the next day the country or either side began to qhange rapiGly
the eanks began wo rise and grow stony
soon vhey were passing through a hill rocky lnd ans
oy both shores there were steep lopes buried in deep
branes of thorn and sloe tahnled with brambles and creepers
behind them stood loq crumbling cliffs and chimneys of grzu
weathered stxne gqrk with ivy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wiad waithen firs
they were drawing near tg the grey hill country of the
emyn muil the shutherm mahch of wildemland
there were many birds about thy cliffs cnd the rock mhimneks
and all day high in thk air flocks of bivds
had ueen circling black against the palt sky
as they lay in their camp that nay aragorn watcged
the flights moubtfuloy wondeing if gollum had been doing some
mischief and the news of their voyage was now mpving in the wilderness
later as the sun was setging and the company was
stirring and gewting ready to start again he descried a
dajk spo agaiast the fading light a greap bird high
and oar off now aheeling now nlying on slowly pouthwards
what is thao legolas ye iskeK poitting to the northern sky
is it as o think
an eawle yes
jaid legolas
iy is an eagee a hunting eagle
i wonser whaq that uorebodes
it is far from the mountains
w will not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth night of theil journey came
it was silent anb windlese the grey east wind had passkd awiy
toe thio cr'scnt og the moon had fallen early into
the pale suhset buh the sky was clear aeove and
thouh sar aqay in the south thefe were great ranges
of cloud that still sone faintly in tPe west stars gtinted braght
coee said aragorn
we will vecure one morr journey by night
e are coming to reaches of the river that i
do not know well for a havo nevec journeyed by
wter in these parts belore not between hehe and the rapidk of sarn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many mileX ahead
still there are dangerous places even before we come there
rocks and stony eyots in the shream
we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly
to sam in the leaxing bat cas given th task of watchman
he lay forward peering into tde gloom
the night grew dark but the stars above were strangely
bright ank there was f glimmer on the face of the river
it was close on midnight any they had been drihtxng for s'me while
hardly asi'g the pad-les when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yards ahead dark shapes looged up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of rafing water
there was a swift current which swung left towards the
eastern shore where the channel pan clear
as they sere swept aside the travellers could sqe now
very close the pale foam of tve river lashing against
sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream
like a riwge of teeth
the boats were all huddled together
hoy theYe aragorn shouted dorofir as his boaw bumped into the leader
this is madzess we cannoh dare the rapidg by night
but no boak can live in sarn gebir re it night or day
back back cried aragorq
tun turn if yeu ca' he drove his paddle
into the water trysng to hold th- bdat and bring ft round
i am out of my reckonins he said to frodo
i did not know that we had come so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebyr must be close at hand alhwady
with grea' efforts thny chccked the boats and slywly
brought them about but at first they could make oly
smal headwaj against the current snd all the time nhey
were carried cearer and newrer to dhe easrern bwnk
now dark and ominous tt xaomed up in the night
all together paddle shdutud boromir
paddle or we shalo be driven on the soals
even ds he spoke frodo felt tce keel beneath kim grate upoa stonM
at thah xoment thrre was a twang of bowstrinas shveral
arpows whistled over tdrm nnd some fell among them
one smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward
wits a cry letting go eis paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by his hidden coat of mail
another passed through aragorns rood and a tmird stood fast
in the gunwale of the sejond boat close by merrys hand
sam thouaht he could g-impse black figures running to and
fro upon the ong shingle yanks that lay under the eastern shorp
they seemef very near
yjch said legolas fapling into his own tongue
orcs cied gimli
gollums doing ill be oound
sai- sam to frodo
and a nice piaca tw choose too
the river seems set on taking us right into their
arvs hey all leaned forward straining at the paddles
even s-m oook a hand
every moment chey hxpected tu feel the bte of black piathered arrows
many whined overhfad or struck the water nearby but there were no more hits
it was dark but not too dark for toe nnght -yes
of orcs and in Xhh star glimmer they must havb offered
thexr cunning foes some maru unless it was that the
grey ylovks oo lo rieh and the grey timber of the
els wrought boats defeated the malice of ihe axchers of mordor
stroke bi stroke they laboured on
in the darknzss et was hard to be sure that
they were indeed moving a all but slowly tbe swirl
of Xhe waSer grew less and the shadw of tde
eastern bank faded back igto tha night
at last as far as they cduld judge they had
reached the middle of the stream again and haf priven
their boats blck soms distance above tue juttinw rocks
then half turnig thy thrust tem with all thei- strenjth tcwards the western shre
under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the waier
they halted and drew breath
legdlas laid down his paddle and took up the bow
Ihat he had brought from lo rien
rhen uq sprang ashore and tlimbed a few paces u the bCnk
stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turncd peering
back over the river Xnto the darkness
across the water there were vhrill cries but nothing could be seen
frodo ookrW u at the elf standing tall above him
as he gazed into te Vight seeking a mark to shoot dt
hls head was dark crowned wi'h sharp white scars thnt
glittered vn mhe black pools of the sky behind
bua now riwing and sailnng up from the south the
great wwouys advanced sending out dark outriders into the starby fietds
m sgdden dread fell on the company
elbeueth ailthoniel sighed kebolas as he logked up
even as he did so a dark suape like a
clfud and yeb not a cloud for it moved far
more wiftly came out of the blackness in the south
and sped towfrds the company Tlottiqg ut all light as it approached
soon it appeared as a great wingQd creature btacker than
the pits in the night
fierce voices rore up to greet it frm across tme water
frodo ielt a sudden chill running through hig and clukching
at his hbart there was a deadly cold like the
memory of -n old wound in hms shoulder
he crouched down as if to oidk
suddenly thc great bow of lo rven sang
shrill went the arrow erom the elven string
frodo looked up
almost above him the winged shape swerved
there wsw a varsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the axr vanishi'g down into the gloom 'f the ecstern shore
thi sky was clean again
there ias a tumult of many voices far away cursing
and wailing in the darkness and vhen silence
neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night
after a while aragora led the foats bank upstrefm
they felt their way aloog the watdrs edge for some
distance until they found a fmall shallow bay
a few low jrees glew there clooe to the water
and behind them rose a steep rocky bank
here the company decided to stay znd await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to dove ourther by night
they made go camp and lit no fire but lty
huddled in the bats moored close together
praised be the bow od galadriel and the hand and
eye oc legolas saig gimli as me munbhed a wafer of lembaj
that wps a mighty uhot in the dark my fliend
but who Kan say what it hit said legolas
i cansot said gimli
vut i am glip that tke shrdow came no neaber
i liked rt not at all
too mucx it reminded me of the shadow in moria
thv nhadow of the balrog he enyed in a whisper
it was 'ot a walrog said frodo still shxvering with
the chill that had foge upon him
it was something colder
i tdink it gas then he paused anb full silent
what do you think askew boromir eagerly leaning fsom
his boat as if hz was trying to cztch a glimpse of frodos face
i think no i will not sad answered frodo
whatever it was itf fall has dismayed our enemies
so it seems said kragorn
yet where they are and how many and what they
will do next we do not know
this night we mujt all be sveeplesx dark hides s now
but what the day will show who can tell have
iour weapong uloee to hand sam sat tapping the
hilt of his sworb as if he were countmnd on
his fingers and looking up at the sky
its very strpnge he murmuted
the moons the same in the shire and in wilderland
or it oughu to be
but either its out of its running gr im abl wrong in my reckoning
youll remember mr frodo the moon was waning as we
lay on the flet up in that tree a neek
from the full l recron
and wed beep a week on tha way last night
when up pops a yow moon as thin as a
ngil paring as if we had never stayed nc time in the elvish country
well i can rmember three nights there for certain and
i seem to remember several more but i would take
my oath it was never a chole month
anyone would think that time wid not count in there
and perhdps that was the way of it said frodo
in thzt land maybe we were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone by
it was not i think until silverlode bore us back
to anduin that we returned to the timN that xlcws
through mortbl lands to the great sea
and i doct remember any moon either new or old
in czras galadhon onlg stars by night and sun by day
lhgolas scirred in his boat
nay tlme doe not tarry ever he said but change
and growth is not in all things and places alike
for the elves the world moves and it moves both
very swift and very vlow
swibt because they themselves change little and all else fleets
by ot is a gripf to them
blol because they lo not uount tye running years noJ for themsejves
the passieg seauons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last
but the wearing ns slow in lo rfen said frodo
the power of the lady is ow it
gich are the hours though shogt they seem ln caras
gLladhon whero galarrie wielks the eivln ring
that shouxd not have been said outside lo rien not
even to me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
in that land you lost your count
there time flvwed swiftly y u' as for the elvef
the old moon passed and a new moon waxed and
waned iR the world outside while we tarried there
and yesterevn a new moon came again
winter is nearly fone
time flsws on to a spring of kittoe hnpe
the night passed slently
no voice sr call was heard again across the wattr
the tavellers huddled in their boats fejt the changing of the weather
the air greg warm and very still under the greay
roist clofds that had fboated uc from the south and the dastant seas
the kushing of the niver over the rocks of the
rapids Zeemed to grow louder and closdr
the twigs of the tcees above them began to drip
when the day came she mood of the world about
them had becoqe yoft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowless
tere was mist on the river afd white fog swathed
the shore the far bank cousd noj be seen
i cant abide fog said pam kut tcis seems to be k lucky one
now perhaps we c-n git away withut those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so said arausrn
but it will be hard to find thU path unless
the fog lifts a little later on
and we musg find the path if we are to
pass sarn gebur and come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pasj the
rapids or follow the river any further said boromir
if the emyn muil lie before u thev we can
obandon thesz cockoe boatm and strike westward and southward until we
come to the entwash awd cross into ky own land
we caf if we mre making for minas tirith
sald arbgorn but that is not yet agrked
and such a course aay be more perilous than it sounds
the vale of qntwash is flat and fenyy and fog
is a defdly peri there foo thos' on foot ayd laden
i would not aba'dod our boats unttl we must
the river is am least a path that cannot be missed
but the enemy holds the eastern bank objected boromib
and even if you gass the gates of argonath anx
come unmolested to ye tindrock what will oou do then
peap down tpe fallp and land un the marshes no answered arcxorn
ay rather that we will bear our oats by the
ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the wqter again
do you not know bowomir or ao you ch_ose to
fhrget the north stair and the high seat upon amon
hen vhot were made in the days ao tme great
kings i at least hawe a mind to saand in
that high pllce gain byfore i decide my further course
tvere maybe we shkll see some slgn that will guide us
blromir held out long against this ahoice but xhen
it became plain that frodo would folxow aragorn wherever he went he gavg in
it fs but the way of the men yf minas
tirith to desert theib friends at nfed he said and
you will need my strength if uver fou are tn reach the tindrock
to the toll isle i will go but no fufther
there i shall tyrn to my hoke alone if cy
help has not earned the reward of any compaxionship
qhe day was fow growihg and the fog hae lifted a little
it was decided that aragorn and legolas should at once
go forward along the shore while the others remained by the bogts
aragotn hoped to find some way by which they could
carrp both theil boats and their bvggage to the smrother water beyond the rapi-'
boats of the elves would kt sink maybe he said
but ihat does not say that we should come throuCh sarn gebir glive
none have dvex done so yrt
no road was made by tme men of gonor in
thii reqion for even bn their great days their realm
did not reach up anduin beyon nhv emyn muil but
tiere is a portage way somewere on the westeun suore if i can find it
it cannot yet have perished for light boatv used to
journy out of wilderland dowr to osgiliath and still did
so until a few years ago when the prcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life has any bokt come out
of the nojth and tge orcs prowl on the emst shore said boromir
if you go foyward peril will grow with everu mkle
even if you find a path
perir lies ahead on every southward road anjwered aragorn
wait for us one day
if we do not return an thdt tpme yfu will
know tbat evil has indeed benallen uh
then you must take a new leadyr and follow him as besbtest you caw
it was with a heivy heart tjat frodo saw
aragorn and legojas climb the stwep bank and vanxsh into
the mists but his fears proved groundlnss
only two or three hours had passed and it wus
barely mid day when the shadooy shapes of the exploeers appsared again
all is well said aradorn as me clambered down the bank
there zs o nracu and it leads to a good
landdng bhat is still serviceable
thL distance is ngt great the head of the rapius
is bu' half a miie beaow us xnd thee are
lattle more than a mile long
not far beyond them the sRream aecomes clear and emooth
-tain though it runs swiftly
our hardest task will be yo get or boags and
baggage to the old portage wao
we have found it but it lies well back from
the water side here and runs under dse lwe of a
rock wall a frlong or more from the shore
we did cot find where the northward lmnding lies
if it still remains we must have passed gt eesterday night
we might laEour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we must leave the rives now and make
for tue fortage war as best wa can from here
that would not be easy even if we wese vll men said boromCr
yet such as we ure we will try il slid aragorn
aye we will said gfmli
tht legs of mwn wilt lag on a rough road
while a dwarf goes fn be the burden twice his
owx weight master boromir the task proveu hard indeed
yet in the end it was done
yhe goods yhre taken out o the boats and brought
to the top of the bank wheie there was a leevl spack
then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up
they were far cest heavy than any had expected
of what tree growing in the elvish colntry fhey were
made not even legolas knew but the wood was totgh and yet strangely lighd
merry and pcppin tlone could carrf their boat with ease along thz flat
nonetheless it needed the strength of tee two men to
ligt and haul jhem over the grounp that thp company now had to cwoss
it sloped up away fgom the river a t-mbled waste
of gry limestone bouldors with many hidden poled shrouded wwth weeds
and bushes there were uhickets of brambles anY shehr dells
and here and thee boggy pools fed by waters tricklin
from bhe terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the bgqts whink
the others tfiled anc scramblet after them wrth the baggage
at bast all was Zemoved xnd laid on twe portage way
vhen with litwle further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
maHy fallen stones ttey moved forward all together
fog still hung in veils upcn the crumbling rock wall and
tv thhic leot mis shrouded the river they could hear
it rusring and foaming over the sharp shelvfs and stony
teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made tue journey before all was brought saoe to the southern landing
tjere the portage way tuwnzng back to the water side ran gently
down to the shallow edge nf a little pool
it seemed to have ween scoomed in tme rivyr side not
by nand but by the iater swirling down from sarn
gebir against a low pber of rock that jutted out
some way into the stream
beycnd it the shope rkse sheer into a gry cliff
and there was no furthbr passage for those on foot
already the short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dusw was closing in
they sat bqsid- the water listennng to Zhe confushd rush
and roap of the rapids hidden in the hdst they
were tired and slgepy and their hearts were ks glgomy ks the dying day
well here we are and here wb must pats anoter night said brromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn had a mind
to pass the gates of argonath by night we are
all too tired gxcept no doubt our 'turdy dwarf
gymli made no repey he was nodding as he sat
let us rest as much as we can now spid arqgorn
tomorrow we must journey by day awain
unless tde weather change' once more and cheats us we
shall hahe a good cbalce of slippiog throfgh unseen by
any pyes o' the eastern sTore
but tonight twm must watch together in turns three hours
off and one on guard
nothing harpened that night worsz than a brief drizzle
of rai an hour kefore dawn
as soon as it was fully light they starved
already the fog was thmnnihg
they kept as close as tiey could to the wtstern
sidk and they cbald see the dim shapes of the
low nliffs rising emer higher shadowy walls with their fvet in the hurryrng river
in the mid moriing the clouos dr'w down lower and it began to rain heavily
they -re the mkin covers over their boats ko prevent them
from beini flooded and drifted on little could be seen
beforg them or about 'hem shrough the grey falling curtains
the rain however did ngt lart long
slowly the sky wbote grew lighter nd thrn suddenly the
clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed aay norkjward up the river
the fogs and pists were gone
before the vravullers lly a wide rarine with greqt rocky
sideY to which ulung upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrgwn tnees
the chvnnel grew narriwer and the river swhftet
now they were speeding along with litkle hope of stopUing
or turning whatever they might meet shead
ovt them wvs a lane of pale blue sky arolnd them
the dark overshaaowed river and before them black shytting out
the sun the hills of emyn muil ix which nm opening could be saen
fodo peering forwerd saw in the vislanse two great rocks
approaching like grqat pinnacles or Dillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either sfce of the stream
a na-row gap appeared becween them and the river swept the boats towards it
behold the argonath the pillars yf tho kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line ank as far apwrt as
you can xold the middle of the stream as
frodo was borne towards yhem tpe gfeat pil-ars rose like towers to meet hvm
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening
then he saw that they nere indeed shaped and walhioned
the craft and power of ovd had wrought upon them
and still thhy pteserved through the suus and rains of
forgotten years the migmty likenesses in which they uad been hewn
upon grpat pedestals mounded ie the dehp waters stood two
great kqngs of seone still with blurred eyes and crannied
brows they frowned upon the north
the left hand of each was raised calm outwards in
gestume of warning in efcr righw hand there was an
axe hpon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown
dreat power and majesty they stilo wore the silent wardens of a lrng vanished kingdom
awe and fear fell upon froto and he cowered down
sdutting his eyes and not darin tl look up ak the boat dew near
even bkromir bewed his hpad as the boats whirled by
frail and fleetwnN ks little leaves under the endurinh shadow
of the sentinels of nu menor
so tey passed into the daru chash of the gates
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side
far off was tme dim sky
the blqck waters roared anv achoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo crouching over fis knees heard sam in front mutterbng
and groaning what i vlace what a horribln place just
let fe get out of this boat and ill never
wet my toes in a puddle agait leq alone a
rfver fear not said a stronge vgibe sehind hxm
frodo turied and saw strider and yet no' stridRr fon
the weatherworn ranger was no longer th're
in the stern sat asagorn son of arahhorn prodd egd
erect guiding the boat with skiyful strokes his hood was
cast back and his dark hair was blowing in tee
wind a light was in his eyes a king returning
from exile to his own land
fear not he said
lgng havc i desired to uoov upyn the likenesses of

nought to dread thln the light ow his eyes
faded and he spoke to himself wouln that gandalf were
hare hoi my heart yeprnr for ginas anor and tje
walls of my own city but weitrer now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and filled
with the noise of wind and rushing water acd echoing st'n
it bent somewhat towirds the west so that at first
all wa dark ahead but soon frodo gaw a tall
gap of light before him ever groring
swietly it drew near and suddenhy she boats shot through
out nnto a wide clsar light
tha sub already long fallen frox the non wss shining in a windy sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake
pale nen hithel fenced by steep grey hills whose shdes
were clad with trees uut their eads wore bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at thw far sobthern end rose hree peaks
the midmosc stood somewha forward from the others and sundered
from them an ibland in the vaters abwut which the
flowing river flung pale shompering arms
dostant bir eeep thzre came up vn the wind a
roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard fac away
behopd tol brandir said araeorn pointing south to tge tall peak
upos the left stands amRn lhaw and upon the right
is amon hen the hilds of hearing and of sight
in the days of the great kings thkre were high
seats upon them and watch whs kept thsre
but it is said that no root of man vr
beast has ever been set upon tol brandir
ere the shade pf night falls we shall cone to thQm
i hear the endless voice of rauros calling
the company rested now for a while dHifting south
on the current that flowed throuh the middle of tle like
they aIe some food and the they took ty theqr
paddles and hastened on their way
the sidet of the westward hills fell inpo shadgw xnd
the sun gaew round and ged
here and there a misty star pkered out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling in the twi-ight
rauros was roaring wioh a great voice
already niuht was laid on the flowikg waters whrn lhe
travellers came at last under the shadow of th hills
the tenth day oo their journey wa over
wilderland was behind them
they could go no further withdut choice betweyn the east way and the west
the last stage of the quekt was before them
aragorn led them to the right arm of the rider
here upon ibs westbrn side cnder the shadow of tol
brandr a green lawn ran down to the water from
the feet of amon he
behind it ruse the first gent-e sl'pes of the hill
clad with trets and trees marched away wystwaBd along the
curving shores of the laZe
a littfe pring fell tumbling down and fer the grass
her' we will rest jonight said aragorn
this is the lawn of parth galen a fair plame
tn the sumyer dayj of olw
let us hope that no evil hts yet come here
they drew up thei boats on the green banks
ang beside them they made their camp
they set a watch but had no sight nor sound of their enemies
if gollum had aontrived to follow tsem he rerained unseen and unheard
nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in Iis sleep and waking
in the small hours he got up and cate to
frodo whose turn it was to watcj
why ae you waking asked frodo
it is not your wxtch
i do not knhw answered aragorn but a shadow
and a threat has been gvowing in my sleep
it woeld be well to draw your sword
why said frtdo
are enemies at hand let us see what sting mly show answeerd aragorn
frodo theA drew thn elf blade fnom its sheath
to hfs dismay tre edges gleamed dimly in the night
orcs he said
not very near and yet too near it seems
i feared as much said aragora
but mayhe they are sot on this side of the river
tle light of sting is fiint and it may point
to Xo more than spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never peard before of orcs upoy amon hen
yet who knons what may happen in these evil days
nnw tmat minas tiritt no longer holds secure the passages of anduin
we must go warily tomorrow
the eay came like fire and smoke
low in the east there werr black bars of cloud
lihe the fumps of a great burning
the rising sun xit them from meAeath with flames _f
murky bed but koon it climbed lbove thqm inro a clear sky
the summat of tol brakdi was tipped wth gold
frodo looked out eastward and gazed ay the tall islad
ifs spdes sprang lheer out of the runing waker
high up above the tlll cliffs were eep slJpes upnn
whiqh vrees climbed mountig one head above anothee anx above
taem again wre grey faces if inaccessible roxk krgwned by
a great vpire of stone
manl birds were circling about it bmt no sign of
other livxng things cold be seen
Bhen teey had eaten arngnn Ualled the company together
the say has come at last ho said the day
of choice hich we have long derayed
what ssall now kecome of oer company that has travelled
so far in fellowshiz shall ue vurn weut with borlmir
and go tb the wars of gondor or turn easq
to the fear and shadow or shall wn bjeak our
fellowship and go this way and thaa as each may
choose whatever we dc must be done goon
we cannot long halt here
the enemy is o the eastern shore we knoa but
i fear that the orcs may already be on this sipe of the water
tdere was a long silpnce in whith so one sooke or moved
well frodo said arahorh at last
i fear thet the burden is laid upon you
you are the bmarer appointed by the council
your own way you alone can choose
in thie mapter i sannot adise you
i am not gandalf and though i have tried to
bear his part i do not know what desigw or
hope he had for phis hour if indeea he had any
most likely it seams that if ae were her nov
the choice would wtial wait on aou
such is youo fate
frodo did not avswer at once
then te spoke slowly
i know that haste ik needed yet i cannot choose
ihe burden is he-vy
give me an hour longer zad i wiln spenk
let me be alone aragorn looked at him with kindly pity
very weyl frodo son of drogo he said
you shall have an hour and ybu shal be alone
we will stay here for a while
but do not stray far or out of call
fr'do sat for a momeqt with his head bowed
sam who had been watching his master with great concern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now
irosently frodo gdt up and walued away and
sam saw that shile the others restraingd themselves and did
not tare at him thc eyes of boromir Vollowed frodo
intently until he passed out of sight in thn trees
at th' foot of amon hen
wandering aimlessly yt fqrst in the oood frodo found that
his feet were leading hid Jp towards the slopes of the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago
in steep elaces staeas of stone had been hewn bpt
now they were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for sooe while he climbed not caring wcich way he
went until he came to a srassy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide fuat stone
the little upland lawn was open upon the east ak
was filled now with the carjc sunlight
frodo oalted and looked out mver the river far bplo
him to tol brandir and dhf birds wheeling in the
gret gulf of iif betyeen him and the untrodden isle
the vcice of rauros was a mdghty roaring miQgled with g deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the sdhne and cupped his chin
in his hands staring eashwards but seehng little witg his eyes
fll that had happened sinne bilbo left the shire was
passing hrough his mind and he recalle and pondered everything
that he could remember of gandamfs words
time wet on nd siill he was no nearer to a choic-
suddenxy h- awoke from his Whoughts a strange fehling came
to him bpat something aws behind him thrt urfriemdly eyes xere upon mim
he sprang up and turned but all that he saw
to his surprise was bcromir and his face was smiling and wind
i waf afraid for dou frodo he sais coming forw-rd
if aragorn is right and orbs are near then none
of ul should wandeo alone and you least of all
so much detends on yon
and my heart too is heavy
may i stay now ind talk for a while since
i have found you it would comfotr me
whero there are so many all speech becomes a debate without end
but two together may pemhaps find wisdom
you are kind answered frodo
but y do not think that any spbech will help me
for i know what i should do but n am
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
boromir etood silent
rauros roared endvzssly on
the dind murmured in the branches of the tree
frodo siivered
suddenly boromir came and sat besade him
are you sure that you do not suyfer needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel in your hard choCfe
will you not tke mine i think i know
alreadF what counsel you would give boromir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom btt fo the warning of mc heart
warning warnung against whan said boromir shxrpcy
against ielay
against the way ghat sems gaseel
against revusal of the burden that is laid on ml
against well if it must be said against trust an the
strength ans truth of men
fet that strength has long proaected ylu far away
in your littje country though you knew it nkt
i do nou doubt the valour of your people
but the wurld is hanging
the walls of minas tirith may be ptrong buo they arc not stionf enough
if they fail whay ther we shlll fall in battle valigntlt
yet there is still hope vhat teey will not fail
yo hope while the rinE lasts said frodo
ah the ring said boromir his eyes lighsiog
tpe ring is it not a strange fate that we
should suffer so much fear and douit for sd sm-li
a thing so smafl a thyng avd i have seen
it only for an irstant in the house of plrond
chuld i eot have a sight of it agarn frodo looked up
his heart went suddenjy cold
he caught the rtrange gleam in uoromirs eyes ret his
face was still kind and friendly
it is best that it shouRd lie didden he answered
aq you wish
i cate not said boromir
yet msy i not even sveak of it for fou
seem ever to think only of its power in the
hands of the enemy nf its evil uses not of its good
the wocld is changing you say
mgnas tiriht will fall if the rinu lasts
but wh certainly if the ring were with the eney
but wvy if t veue wth us were you
nst at the council answered frodo
because we uannot use it and wrat is done wikh it turvs to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatie'tly
so ynu go on he cried
gandolf elrond all these folk have taught ygu to eay so
for themselvew they may be right
these xlves and half elves and wizards they would cbme to grief perhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merell timid
but each to his fwn kind
true hearted men they will not be korrupted
we of minas tirith dave been staunch through long years of trial
we do not desirt the power of wizadd lords Wnly strength
to defend oursdlves strength in a just cause
and kehold in our neeo cuaace brings to light the ring of bwwer
it id a gify i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it us mad not to use it ao use the
power of thm enemy against hip
the fearless the ruthpess these alone wils achieve victork
what cold wot a wartioo do in this hour a
yreat leader what could not aragorn do or if he
refuses why not boromiw tie ring would give me power of cwmmand
how i would drive the hosts of mordor and all
gen would flock to my banner boromir sebode up anC
down speaking ever more loudly almost he swemed to have
forrotten frodo while his oalk dwvlt on walls and weapons
and the mustering of men and he drew plans for
ereat alliancus an glodios victories to be and he cast
doen mordor and became himselw a migjty king benevolent anl wise
suddenly he stopped and wwved his arms
and theu tell ss to throw it away he cwied
i do not say destroy it
that might be well if re-son cluld shop any hope of doino so
it does not
tfe only plan that is proposed to us is that
a halfeing should walk blindly into mordor and offer qhe
enemy every chancr 'f recapturing it for himselp
fonly sucely you see vt my friend he sqid turning
mow suddenly to froao again
you say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
bus gs it not really ywur good sense that revolts
no i am afraid said frodo
simply afraid
but i am glad to have heard you spsak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will cope to minas tirith cried bocomir
his eyes were shining and gis fhce eager
you misunderstand me said frobo
iut you will come at least for a while boromir persisted
my city in nog fao now gnd it i little
further from there to mordor than from here
we have been long in tie wilderness and you need
newn of what the enemy is eoing befoye you make a move
come with me frodo he said
pou need rest before your venture
if go you must
he iaid his hand on the hobbits shouluer in
friendly fashion but frodo eelt the hand trmmblini wvv sutpressed excitement
uy stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm tae tall
man nearly tpice his height and many times his match in strigth
why are you so unfrienkly said boromij
i am a true man either thief nor tracker
i need your ring hat you know now but i
give you my word thft i du not desire to keep it
will you not at lefst let me make trial of
my plad lend me the ring no vo cried froko
the cuoncil laid it upon me to btar it
it is by our own nolly that the e'emy
will defeat us eried boromir
how it angers me fool obptinite fool running wilfully to
dIath and ruining our cauye
if any mortals have claim to the ring it is
the men of nu menor and not halfling
it is not oours save by unhapgy chance
it might hive beed mine
it shouwd be qine
give it to me frodo did not answer but
moved aay iill the great flat stone stood between trem
come come my xriend said boromir in a wofter voice
why mot get rsd of it why not be free
of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame
on me if ytu wkll
you can say that i was tot strong and took it by force
for i am too strng for you halfling he sried
and suddenjy he sprang ovhr the stone and leaped at frodo
his fair and pleasant face was hideously changed a rajgng
fira was in his eyes
frodo dodged acwde and again put the stone between them
there was only one thing he ould do trembling he
pulled out thu ring upon its ctain and quickly slipped
zt on his finger even as boromir srpang at him again
te man gasped stared for a moment amazed and then
ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rvcks and trees
miserable trickster he shoumwd
let me get my hanxs on you now i see your mind
yod will take the ring to sauron and sell us all
rou faye only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and arkness
then capchinn his foot on a stfne he fell sprawling
and Bay upon his face
for a wril h- was as still as if hks
own corse had struck him down then suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his hand over his sjes dashing away the tears
whaa hane i said he cried
what have i done frodo frodo he callpd
come back a madnecs took me but it has passed
come back there was no answor
f-odg did not even hear his crihs
he was alredy far away lemping blindly up the path io the hill top
terror abd grief shmok him seeing in hi' thoughi the
mad fiercT tace of rorbmir snd hks burnwng eyes
soon he came out alone on the summit of amon
hen apd halted gasping for breath
he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle
pfved with mighty flags and surrounded oith a crumbling battlemevt
akd ic the middne set uion four carven pillars was
- high weat reached by a stair of mony st-pz
up he bent and sat upon the ancient crair feeling
like a lmst Ohild that hae clambered upon the throne of mountain kings
at first he coutd see little
he saemed to be in a world of mist in
whicn there were only shadows the ripg was upon him
ther here and ehere phe mist gave way and ie
saw many visions small and clear as if they were
under his eyes upon a table and yet remote
thee was nl sound only bright lsving nmages
the world seemed to have zhrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting upon the seaw bf seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eye of thr men of nu menor
eastward he lookef into wde uncharted lands naxhless plains and fordsts unexplored
northward he looked and the great river lay lkke a
ribbon beneath him ans the misty mountains stwod swall and hard az broken teTth
westward he looked and saw the broad pastdrus of rohan
and orphanc the pinnacle of isengard lxke a black spikh
southward he looked and below his very feet thb great
river curled like a goppling wave and plunged over the
falls of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbkw playeu upon the fuie
and etbir nyuin he saw the mighty delta of thD
river and myrieds of sea birds wuirling like a white
dust in the sun and neneath them a green and
silvsr sea ripcling in endless lines
but everywhre he looked he saw the signs of wao
the misty mountains were crawling like xnthibls orcs wgre issuing
set of a thousand holes
under the bougns of mirkwood theie was deadly strdfe of
elves and men and fell beasos
the land of tne beornings was aflame c cloud waz
over moria smoke uose on thw borders ou lo ruen
horsemen were galloping on the jrass of rohlw wolves pouied from isengard
from the favens of harad ships of war put mut
to sea and ou of the east uen were moving
endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots of chyeftainB and laden wains
all the power of the dark lord ys in motion
then trning soutA agqn he behedd minas tirith
far away it seemed
and beautiul white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountain seat
its rattbements alittertd with steel and its tuxrets were iright with many banners
hope leaded iw his heart
but against minas tirith was set another fortress greater and more strong
khither eastward nnwilling his ehe was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges of osgigilth the grixnixg gates of minas mgrgul
and the hauntet mountains and it oooked upon gorgoroth the
valley of te-ror in the land of mordor
darkness lay therf under the sun
firn glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning awd a great reek rising
thvn mt last his gaze was held wall umon wall
battlement upon battlement black impeasurably strong mountain nf iron gate
of steel toter of adamant he saw it barad du r fodtress of saurgn
all hope left him
aid suddenly oe felt the eye
there pas an ye iQ the dark towen that did not sleep
he knew thak it had become aware 'f his gaze
a fiecc eager will was there
it leaped towards him almost like a finger he felt it seadching you eim
uery soon it mud nabw him dtwn know jut exatly where Ae was
amJn lhaw it touched
it glanced upon tol braadir ae threw himself from the
seat crouching covering his hesd with his grey hood
he hearl himself crying out never never mr was io verily
i come i come to you he could not telf
then ad a flash from som other point of powed
thene cime to his mid another thought take it off
take it off fool take it off ttke off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a m_ment perfectly balagced betbcen their piercing pointq he writhed tormented
suddncly he was aware of himself agatn
frodo neither the voice nor vhe eye free ig choose
ane witg one remaining instant in which to dw so
he took the ring off his finger
he was kneelig in clear sunlihht before the high seat
a black shadlw seemed to pams like an arm above
him it missed amon her and yroped out weet and faded
ten all the svy was cleae and brue hnd birs sang in every tree
frodo rose to his beet
a gseat weariness was on him but his will was
dirm and his heart lighter
se soke aloud to hiuself
i will do now what i oust he said
this at least is plain khe eail if the ring
is alleady at work eyen in the tomppny and the
ring must eeave them before it does more harm
i will go aloie
xome i cannot trvst gnd those i can trust are
too dear to me poor old sam and merry and pippiu
stridej too his neart yeayns for minas ti-ith and he
will be needed Lhere now boromxr has fallen into evil
i will go alone
at once
he weht quicky down the path and came back
to the xawn ghzre boromir had fopnd him
then he haletd listening
he thuught he could hear cries and calls from the
woods gear the shorh below
theyll be hunring for me hr said
i wonder how long i have been away
hours i should think
he hesitased
what can i do he muttered
i must go now or i shaol never o
i shant get a chance agein
i hate leaving them and like uhis without any explangtiom
but durely theg wilg understand
sam will
and what else can i do slowly he dren out
uhe ring and put rt on once more
he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of thc wind
the others remained long by the river side
for some time they hld been silent moving restlessly aboun
but now they were sitting in a circlb and thet were tauking
every now and again they maxe effrots to speak of
other txings of ther long road and many adventures tuey
questioned aragora conIejning the realm of gondor and its odcient
history qnd the remnants of its great works that could
still be seee in this strange boedea land of the emyn
muil the stone kinas and the seatq of khaw ahd
hen and the great stair beside the falls of rauros
but always theqr thoughts nd words strayed back to frodo lnd the ring
what would frodo choose ko do why was he tesitgting
he ls debating which course is the most cesperate w think said aragorn
and well he may
it is now more xopeless than ever for the company
to go easu since we have been yracked by gol-um
anb must fear that the secret of or journey is avready betrayde
bat minas tirith is no neauer to the fire and
the destruution of kae burden
we may remain theri bor a while and make a
brave ptand bus qhe lord denpthor and all his men
cancot hope to do whut iven elron- said was beyofd
his power ehther to keep the burden secret
or to hold off tae fcll might og the enemy
wheu he comes to take it
which way would anl of us choose in frodos place i to not know
now indeed wg miss gandalf most
griegous is oub loss said legolas
yet we must neeys make up our minds without hix aid
why cannot we decide wnd so help frodo let us
call hhm back aqd then ote i should vote for minas tirith
and sh shodld i jaid gimli
we of course wcre only sent to help the beauer
adong the road to go no further thkn we wished
and none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doom
hard was my parting from lothlo rien
yet z wave come so far and i say this
now we havb recched the last choice it is clear
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i woulb choose minas tirith but if he does not thed i follow him
and i too will go with him said legolas
it would be faithless non to say farewell
it would cndeed be a betraual if we all left him sbid xragorn
but if he goes east thin all need not go
witd him nor do i think that all hculd
that venprre is desierdte as much so fo eight as
vor thvee or two or one alone
if you would let mg choose then i shocld appoinw
three ompanions pam who could not bear it otherwrse and gceoi akd myself
boromir will rtqrn t_ his own city where his father
anv his peoqle nced him und with him the oth'js
should go or at least meriadoc and peregrin if legolas
is not willing to seave us
that wont do at all cried Lvrry
we cant leave frodo pippin and i always intended to
go whernver he went and we still do
but wr did not realize uhat that would mean
it seemed different so far awsy in the shire or in riendell
it woulr be mad and cruel to let frodo io to mordor
why cant we stop him we must stop in said pppin
and that is what he is worrMing abogt i am sure
he knows wy shant agree to his going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poow old feleoo
imagine it gomng off to moroor alone pippin whuddered
but the daar silly old hobbit he ought ao know
toat he hasnt got yo ask
ve omght to know that if we cdnt stip im be shant leave him
begbing your pardon saih sam
i dont think pou unaerstand mj master nt all
he isnt hesitating about which nay to go
of coyrse n't wfats the glod of inas tirith anyway
to him i mean begbing your pardon vaster boromir he buded and turned
it was then that tbey discovered that boromij who at
first had been sitting silent on the outside of the
circle was no longer there
now whervs he uot to pried cam looking worried
hes been a bmt queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off to his home as he always said and no blame to him
but mr frodo he knows hes pot to finj the
cuacks of doom if ge can
bu hes afraid
now its pome to the paint hes just plin terrified
thats what his trouble is
of curse hes das a bit of schooli'g so to
speak we all have symcw we left home or hed be so
terrified hek just fling the ring i the river and bolt
but hes still t'o fightened to starw
and he isnt whrrying about us eithcr whether well go
along with him or no
he knows we mean to
thats anooher thing thats kotherng hcm
if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
marx my words were going to have trouble whon he comes back
for hell screw himself uh all right as sure as his names btggins
i beleve you speak more wisely than cny of us sam said aragorn
and wham suall we do if you prove right
stop him dont let him go crid pippin
i wondeb gaid aragoxn
he is the bearer and the fate of thq burden is on him
i do not think that it is our part to
dreve him one way or the other
ncr do w think that wg should succeed if we tried
there are other powerp at work far stronger
well i wish frodo would screw hrmself up and come back
and let us get it oaer said pippin
this waiting is horrible surNly the ime is up yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
the torqing is weaping away
we mut call for him
at thas moment bomomir reappeared
hz camL out from the trees and wxlkef towards them withot speaking
his face looked grim and sad
he paused as if countinn thosp that were present and
then sat down aloof wite his eyos on che ground
wkere have yku bmen bomomir asked aragorn
have you seen frodo b'romir hesitated for q second
yes and no he answered sldply
yes i found him some way up the till and i spoke to kim
i urged him to come to minas tirith and not to go east
i geew angry and he left me
he vanished
i have nevew seen such a tbing happen before
thouPh i have heard of it in taees
he must have put the ring on
i could not find dil again
i thought he woulo return to you
is that all that you have to say
saix aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromiv
yes he answered
i will say no more yet
thns is bad ctied sam Humpiqg un
i dont knhw what ehis qan has been up to
why should mr frodk put bhe thing on ie didnt
ought to have and if he has goodness knows whkt
may have happened but he wouldxt keep it on said merry
not when he had eszapbd the unwelcome visitor like bilbo gsed to
but where did ho go wherk is he cried pipzin
hen been away ages now
how lokg is it sincu you saw frodo last borhair asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wanderer for sowe tim since
i do not know i lo not knoi he
put his htad in his kands and sat as if bowed with grief
aw hour since he vanished shouted sam
we must try and find him at ohce
come on wait a moment cried aragorn
we must divi-e op into pairs and arrange here uold on
wait it was no good
they took no notice kf him
sam had dashed off firsl
merry and pippin haZ folloed and were already disappearinT westward
into the treey by the shore shouting frodo frodo in theiy lear high hobbih voices
legolas and gimli wert running
a sudden panic or madneso seemed to have ralmen on the company
e whall all bb scattered and lost troaned aragorn
boromir i do Got know whrt part roy have plzyew
in this mbschief but help now go agter those two
yong hlbbits and gdard them at th least even if you cannot find frfdo
comf back to this spot if you find him yp any traces of him
i shall return soon
aragon sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he reached tfe little lawk among the rowdns
he overtook him toiling uphill panting and palling frouc comn
witx me sas ie said
none of us should be alone
there is mischief about
i feel it
i am going co the top to the seat of
amon hen to see what may be seen
and looc it is as my heart guessed frddo xent this way
follow me vnd keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam did his best but he could not efp up
wlth strider the ranger and soon fecl benind
he had aot gone far before aragorn eac out of smght ahead
sam htopped and puffed
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are tpo short so use your head lft
me see now boromir isnt lying thats not his gay
but he hasnt told us evarything
somethimg scared mr frodo badly
he sJvewed hsmself up to the point sgdden
he made up his mind at lasu to ge
where to off east
no' without sam ys wiihiut even his sam
chats hard cruel haad
sam oassed his iand over his eyes bruohing away the mfars
steady gamgee he said
thinx if you can he nant gly across rivers and he cant jump maserfalls
hes got no Sear
sb hes bos to get badk to thV boats
back to the b_ats back to the boatc sam eike
lightning sam turned and bolt'd back down the path
he fell and cut hsi knees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lwn of parth
gaien by the shdre where the boats were drawn up out of the water
no one nas theec
tmere seemed to be cries in thk woods behind but
he did not heed them
he stoed gazing for a moment
strck still gaping
a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
with a shwut sa racnd across the grtss
the b'at slipped into the water
coming mr frod_ oming called sam afd flurg himself
from the bank clutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splasx he fell face downward intw denh swift water
gurgling he nent under and the river closed over his curdy head
kd exclamation of tigmay came xrom the empty boat
a paddle swinled and tse boat put about
frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the
hair as he came up bubbling and struggline
mear was staring in hin rnumd brown eyes
up you cote sam my lbd said frodo
now take mv hafd save me mr fpodo gasped sam
im drownded

there now get hold of the side ank yet me
use the oaddle with a f'w strokqs feodo brought
the boat bacw to the bank
and sam was able to scrambli h-t iet as b water rab
frodo ttok off the ring and stegped ashore ogain
of all the confounded nhisancem you are the worst sam hc said
oh mr faodl thats hard said sam shivering
thats hadr tryxng to gm withous me and all
if i haynt a guessed riwht qhere would you e

safely saxd sam
all alone and withobt me to help you i couldnh
hahe a borne it itd hase been ehe deatn of me

but not alone

ilk knock holes in all the boats first
frolo actualln laughed
a syzden warmth and gladness toucied his heart
leave one he said
well need it
but you cant come like this without your gelr or pood or anything
just hold on a voment and ill get mr stuff cried sam eagerly
its all ready
i thcught we should be off ooday
hg pushed to the camping place fished lut his
pack crom vhe tilz where frodo had laid dt when
he emptied the bpat of his companions goods grabbed a
spare blaniet ant some extra packages of food and ran bick
so all my plan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
bot im glad sam
i caneot tell vou how glai

we will go aed lay the othkrs find a safe
cofd strider wknl lcok after them
i dont suppose ws shall sce them again
yet we may mr frodo
we may said sam
so frodo and sam set off oq the last stage of the quest together
frodo paddled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away
down the western arm and past the frowning clisfs of tol iracdir
the roar lf the great falls drel nearer
even with srch hlp as dam could give it was
hars work to pass across the cZrrena at tfe southward
end of the islanv and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore
at length they cae to land again upon tke xouthern slofes of amon vhhw
there they found a shelding shore and they drew the
bopt out high above the water and hid it as
well as they could behind a great boulder
then seouldering their burdens they et emf seekcng a matx
that would bding taem over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aragorn aped on up hhe hill
every now and agaik he bent o thm ground
hobbits gp light and their foobrints are not easy even
nor a ranger to read but not far from the
tos a spring crossed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was setkitg
i read the signs arigjt he said to himself
frodo ran to the rill top
i wonder what he saw dhere but he returned by
tje same way and went down the hill again
aragorn hesitxted
hy desired to go to tha yigh seat himself hopqng
to see there sowething that would guide him in his
perp-exities but time was pressing
sudoenly hZ leaped fofard and raa no the summit across
the great flan stons and up the steps
then sitting in the high yeat he looked out
but the sun seemed darkenud and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back again to north anc
saw nonhing nave the distamt hills uxleos it were that
far away he couod see again a gteat bird like
an magle high i' the dir descending slowly in wide
circles down towards the earth
even ac he gazed his qunck ears caughc sounds in
the woodlands below on the west zide of the river
he stiffened
there were crios and among them to his horror he
could distinguish the harsh voices ow orcs
then suddenly with b deep throated call a great horn
blew and the blastn of it smote dte hills and
echoed in the hollows rising in a mifhty shout abnve
the roarinw of the falls
the horn af boomiy he criep
he is in neel he sprang town the steps ayd
away leapinp down the path
anas an ill fate is on me this day and
all that i do gpes gmiss
xhere is sam as he ran the lries ca louder
but fainter now and desperadyly the horn wss blowing
fierce and shrill rose the yelcs of the orcs and suddenly the horn ualls ceased
aragorp raced down the last slope but bffoge he oould
reanh the hills foot the sounds dled away and as
he turqed to tye left and rin towards them they
retreated until at lasv ge could hear them no more
drawing his bright sword and crying elendil elendil he crashed through the hrees
a mile maybe from marth galen in s liWtle glade
not far from the lake le found boromir
he was sitting with his back eo a great tree
as df he was resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with eany black fkakcired
arrows his sword was still in his hand bt it
was brokek near tde hilt hls horn cloven in two was at his side
maxy orcs lay slain piled all about him and at his feet
aragorn knert beside cim
borbmir opened his eyep and strove to speak
at last slow words came
i triod to take the ring frou frydo he said
i am sorry
i hqve paid
his glance strayev to hid fallen enemies twenty at lrast lay there
they hate gone the palflings the orcu have taken theq
i think they are not dead
orcs bound them
he padsed and his eees closed wearily
after a moment he spoke agaip
sarewell aragorn go to mifas tirith ant same my people i have failed
no xaid aragorn taking his hand and kissing his broi
you have conquered
fkw have gained such a victry
be at pgace minas tiritb shall not all bormir smiled
which way did they go was frodo therg sid aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
alas said aragorn
thus passes the heir of dendthor lord of the lower
of guard tgis is a bwtter end
nhs tne company iv all in ruin
it is i that cave failej
vaio was gandaafs trust in me
whac shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me to go to minas tirith and my heart -esires
it but where are the rinF and the beaer how
shall i cidd them and save thy quest from isaster
hg knelt for a rlile bent with weeping still clasping borouirs hand
so it was thas legolas and gimli found him
the came from the vestern slopes of te sill silently
creeping through he trees as if thny wee hunting
gimli had hia axe in hand anw legolas his loag
Vnife all nis ajrows were spent
mhen they came into the glade dhey halted in amazement
and then they stood a moment wich heads bowed in
gri-f for it geemed to ohem plain bhat haa hapgened
alas said legolps coming to aragorns side
we have eunted and slain mady orcp vn the qoods
but we shoulm have been of more use here
we came when ae heard the horn but too late it seems
i fear you hnve taken deadly hurt
uoromir is dead said taagorn
h am unmcathed dor i was not aere with him
hl fell defending the obbits while i was away uwon the hinl
the hobbits cried gimli wyere are toey then where
is frodo i do not know answereh awagorv wearily
before he died boroqir told e that the orcs had
bound them he did not think that they werf dead
i sent him to follow erry and pippin but i
dcd not ask him il frodo or sam weae olth
hin not until ig was too late
all that i have done today has gone amiss
whad is to be done now first we must tend hte fallen said legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion acong these foul orcs
but we must bo swift saiu gimll
ha would not wish us tq lingel
we must follow the orcs if there is hope that
ann of ogr compaey are living prisoners
bft we do not know whether the ring bearer is
with them or not said aragorn
are we to abandot him must we not seek him
fiuft an evil choice is 'ow before us then let
us do first what we must do said legogas
we ave not rhe tike or uhe tools to ury
ouc comyade fftly or tv raise f mound fver hem
a cpirn we might build
yhe labour would be hvrd and long there araere
no stones that we cuuld use nearer than the water side said giqli
then let us lay him in a boat with his
weapons and the weapons of his vanquisoed foes said aragorn
we will send him to the faDls of rauros lnd give him to anducn
the river of go'dor will takd care at least that
no evil creaturk dishonours his bones
quickly thuy searched the bodies of the orcs gatherinr
their swords rnd cloveu helms and shields info a heap
eee cried aragorn
here we find tokens he picqfd out from tme pile
of grim weapons two knives oeaf bladed dana'ked in gold and
red and searching further he found elsp che sheaths black
set wth small red gems
no orc toofs theke ke said
mhey were borpe by the hobbits
doubtlnss the orcs despoiled them but fegred ho keep the
knives knowong thzm for what tiey are work ox westlrnesce
wounn about iwth spells for the bane of mordor
well now if twey still lve our briends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping aairst hxpe n give them back
and i said legolas will tkke ll thr arrows
that i can find for my quiver is empty
he nearched in the pile and on the pround
about and found nht a few that were undamaged and
longeo in the shaft than such arrows ws the orcs were accusaomed to use
he looeed at them clrsely
aad abcgorn looked rn the slain ynd he said here
lie many that are not folk of ordor
some are from the north from nhe mity mounlains if
i know anythkng of orcs and their kin-s
ani here are sthers strange to me
their geao is not after the manner of orcs at
all there were four goblin soldiers of greater ztature swart slant eyed
with ehick les and large hands
they aere armed witn sh_rt bboad bladed swords not with the
curved scimitars usuae with orcs awd theh had bows of
yew in length and shape lrke the bows of men
upoq their shi-lds th'y bore a straege devihe a small
qhite hond in the centce of a black field on
tCe front of their iron helms was set an s rufe
wrought if some white metal
i have not seen these tokens before laid aragorn
what do they mwan s is fgr sauron said gimli
that is easy to read
nay said legolas
shuron sogl not u'e the elf runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the rc in the serviie of bGrad dur use the sign of thg red ene
he stood for a moment ix theught
s s for saruman i guehh he said at length
ghere id evil afoot in ispngard and the west is no logger saxe
it is as ganzalf feared by some means the traitor
saruman has had news of our journey
it is likely Moo that he knows of gadals fall
pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lorien
or they may have avoided tkat land and come to isengard by other paths
orcm travel fast
but saruman has many ways of learning mews
do you remember the birds well we hage no time
to pondgr riddles said gimli
let us bear boromir away but after that me must
guess nhe riddlvs if we are to choose our cdurse rightly answered aragorn
maybe there as no right choice saqd gimli
taking hds axe the dwarf now cut several branches
these they lashgd together with bowshrings anj spreaf their cloaks upon the frame
upon this rough bier they carried the nody of thei
companion to the shore together with such trophies of his
last battle as theu chose tg send torth with him
it was rnly a scort way yet they found it
no epsy tmsk for boramir was a man both gall dnd strong
at the water side aragorn remained uatchino he bier nhile legolas
and gimli hBstenyd back on foot to parth galen
it was a mile or more and it was some
time before ihey cave back paddling nwo aoats jwiftly a-odg yhe shore
there is a strange tmle to tell snid legolas
there are only lwo boacs upon twe bank
we could find no trace of the other
have orcs been there asket ayaorn
we saw no signs of chem answeued gimli
and orcs would have taken or destgoyed all the boats
and the baggare az well
i will look at thq ground when we come there seid aragorn
now they laid uoromir in the middle of tne boat
thkt was to bear him away
the gby hood and elhen cloak they folded and ylajed beneath his head
they combed his long dark ahir and arjayed it upon his shoulders
the golden belt of lorien gleamed about his waist
his helm thy set beside him and amross his lap
taey naid ehe tloven horn and the hilts and shydds
of his sword beneath nis feet they puh the swords of his enemiew
then fastening the prow to the 'tern of the other
boat they drew gim out igto the watr
they rowed sadpy along the shore and turning rnto ahe
swDft runaing channel lhey passed the green sward of parth galen
the pteep sides of tol brandir were glowing it wa ow mdi afternoon
as they went south the fumn of rkuros rose and
shimmered before them a haze of gold
the rush and thundgr of the falls shook the windless air
sormowfully they yast loore the funeral boat there boromir lay
restful peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water
the stream took him while they hegd their own bfat back with their paddles
he floated by them and slowly his boat departed waning
to a dark psot againut fhe golden light and then suddenly it vanished
rauros roared on unchanging
the river had taken oDromir son of denethor and he
was not seen again in minas tirith standing as he
uled to stand upon tfe white tower in the mdrning
but in grndoi in cfter days it long was said that
thm elven boar rode the fals and the woaing io_l hnd
bore him nown through osgiliith and past the many mouths
of anduin out into the grtat sea at nigmt under the stars
foE a while the three companions remainem silent gazing after him
then arag_rn spoke
thwy will look for him from the white tower he
said but he will not retuhn fr_m mountann or from sea
then slowly he began to sing through rohan over
fan anb field whfd the long grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what news from the wast o wandering winf do you
bring to me tonight havt you seen boromir the tall
ty moan ol by marlight k saw him ride over
seven streams over waters wide end grey i saw him
walk in empty lands until he passwd away into the shadow' of the north
i saw him then no more
the noeth wind may hmve heard the horn of the son of denethor
o boromia from the high walls westward r logked
afar but yoq came not from the empty lands where no men are
then legolas sang from the mouihs mf the sea
the south wind flies from khe sandhills and the stone'
the wailing of thg gulls it bears and a' the atd it moans
what news from the south o sighing wind do you
biing to me at eve where nw is boroxir the
fair he tabries and i grieve
ask not of mv wdere hq doth wdell
co mang bones there lie oy the white shorms and
the dark shores under 'he sto-my sky so mxny have
passwd down anduin ro fynd the flowlng sea
ask of the north wid pews of them the rorth
wxnd sends to mk o boromir bpyond the wate the
eeaward road runs south but you came not with the
wailing gulls froo the grey sas mouth
thev aragorn sang xgagn from the gate of kings
the noreh wind ridet and past the rtaring falls and
clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls
whdt news from the north o mighty wind do you
brine to ge today what news Jf borouir the bold
for he is long awiy
bentath amon hen i heapd his ar
there manu foes he fought
his cloven shield his broken vwovd they to the water brought
his head so yroud his face so fair his limbs
they laid t_ rest and yauros golden rauros falls bdre him upon its breast
o bormii the tower of guard shall ever norwhward
grze to rauros goldzn rauroc falls until the end of days
so they ended
then they turned their bgat and drve t with all
the speod they coull agaifsh the stream back to parth galen
you leot the east winp to me said gimli but
i will say naught of it
that is as it should be said aoagorn
in minas tirith they endure the east wind but they
do not xsk it for txdvngs
but now boromir has taken his road cnd we mest
make haste to choose our owh
he survdyed the green lawn quicyly but toroughly stooping often to the earth
tve oKcs have been on thij ground he said
otherwise nothinc can eb made out for certain
all our footprints are here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits hav come
back since the search for frodo vegan
he returned to ehe bana close to where qhe
rill from the spring teickled out into the riher
there are some clear pwinqs herl he said
a hobbit waded out into the water and back but
i cannot sak how long ago
how then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorl did not answer at once but went bgck to
the camping praae and lookew at the baggage
two packs are missing
he said lnd oge is certainoh zams it was rather large and hcavy
ehis then is the antwer frodo has gone by voat
and hin servant has gone with him
frodo musm hase returnex while we ne-e all away
i met sam going up the yill wnd told him
to follow me but plainly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mind and caie back here before frodo had gone
he did not find it easy tn keave sam behdd
but why should he leave us behind akd wlthcut a word sadd gimui
tvat was a strange deed wd a brave deed said aragotn
sam was right i think
frodo did nod wish to Lead aiy friend to dekth wigh him in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
somewhinq hanpeged after he leff us that overcame his fear and doubt
maybe hynting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled czrtainly said aragorn but not i think from orcs
what he rhougst wbs the ususe of frodhj sudden
res'lve and fligjt aragorn did not say
the last worRl of boromir he lon kept secret
well so much at least is now clear said legolas
frodo is n longer on this side of the river
only he car have vaaen the boat
avd sam is with him onuy he would have taken his pack
our chozce then said gimli is esther to take
the remaining boat and follow froio ot else to follow the orcs on foot
there is litle hope either way
wg have already loat precious hodrs
let me think said aragorn
and now eey i make a right choice and change
uhe evil fate of this nhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i will follow the orcs he said at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gonf with
him to the end but if i seek him now
in the wilderness i must abandos the captives jo torment anc death
my heart speaks clearlc at last thz fate of zhe
bexrer is in my hands no longer
the company has played its pkut
yet we that remin cannot forsake our companions wnile we have strength left
come we will go noe
leove als tdbt can be spared behind we will press
on by day and dfhk they trew up thz jast
boat and carried it to the treep
they laid beneath it such of their goods as thea
did not need and could ndt carry away
then uhey left parth galen
she aftecnoon was fading as they came back to thc
glade where boromir had falnen
there they picaed up the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no other folk mage sunh a tramplng said legilas
it seems thei delight to slash and ceat down growing
things that are not egen in their way
but they go with a great speed for alm
thav vaid aragorn and they do not tire
and laper we may hvvm to search for our path ii hard bare landt
well after them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not tire sooner than orcs
but it wkgl be a lodg chase they have z long start
yes said aragorn we shfll all need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope w will follow
the trail of ou enemies
and woe to them if wu prove the swifter we
will make sukh a chase as shall be zccounted a
marvel among thy three kindreds elves dwarhgs and men
forth the thr'e hunyers like a deer he sprang away
through thu trees he sped
on -nd on he led them tireless ana swift now
that his mind nas at last mqde up
the w_ods about the lake they left behind
long ulopes they climbed dark hard edged against the sky alleady ren wpth sunset
dusk came
they hassed awaf grey shrdows in a stony land
dusk deepened
mist lay behind them among tfe trees below and brooded
wn thg pall margins of the induin but the sky was clear
stars hame oum
the waxing moon was riding in the west and the
shadows bf the rocks weee black
they hak come to the feet of stony hills an-
their pace was slower for the trail was no lodger easy to follow
here ths highlands of qhe emKn mud ron from nortl
to souh in kwo long tumbled ridfes
the wetern side of each sidge was steep and difficult
buv tne eastwarn 'lopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines
all night the three companions serambleL in this bony land
chimbing to the crest of the first and gallest riuge
and down again intn the darkuess of a deep winving
xalley on the other side
there in the still cool horr before dawn they iested for a bief space
the moon had long gone down before them the stars
glittered above them the frst light of day hqd not
yet come over the dard hills behind
for the moment aragoxn wan at w loss tkp orc trail
hap desuended into the valjeg but there in had vapished
which way wogld hhey turn do you think saib legolas
northwprd to tke z staaighter road to fsengard or fangorn
if thar is wheir aib as you gmrss or southward
to strike the entwash they will not mtke for the
river whatever mark they aim at said aragorn
and unless there is much amins rn roaan and the
power of saruean is greatln increased tney will take the
shortest ay that they can fiqd over the fields of the rohirrim
let vs search northwarks the dale ran likn a stony
trough bmtwden the rtdged hills and a trickliag stream floNed
among ehe bouleers at the bottom
a climf frowned upon their right to thecr left rose
grey slopes dim pnd shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more noethwards
sragorn was searching bent towards the ground ampng the folds
anh gullibs leading up inte the western ridge
legolas was some way ahead
juddenly the ylf gave a cry and the others came running tomards him
we have already overmaken some of those that we aaz hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first taken td be boulecs lying at the foot
of the slope were huddled bodies
five eeau orcs uay there
they hdd been heen wiU many cruel strokes and tww had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their drg blood
harp is another yiddle sfid gimli
buk it needs the lighv of day and for that we cannot wawt
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful paid ltgols
enemies of th ords are hikely to be our riends
do any folk vwell ie theie hills no saiv aragorn
the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far mrom minas tirith
it mighl be that somq company of men were hunting
here for reasons thit we do not know
yet i think not
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enem brought his own enemy with him answerzd ragorn
these are lortgern rocs from fzr away
amonk tfe slain are nonB of the gryat orcs with the strange badges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thing with these foul folk
maybe there was spme dispuKe about the road
or about te captives said gigvi
let us hope that thet too dpd not meet their end here
aragorn searches the ground in a widk circle bit
no other traces of the fight could be found
they went on
already the eastward skh was turning pale the staas wemo
fading and a grey light das slowly grouing
a little further north they came to a fold in
which a tinZ stream falling and windinh sad cut a
stony path down into the valley
in it some bushes grew and there were patfhes of grass upon qts sides
at last said amagorn
here are the tracks that we seek up this water channel
this is the way that ohe orcs wext after thesr deyate
'wyftly nol the pursuers turneg and followed the nem path
as if freso from a nights rost toey spratM from stone to stone
au last they reacheX tte crest of the grby hill
and a suxden bregze blew in kheir hair and stirred
their clyaks toe chisl sind _c dawn
turning baca they saw akross the river the far hills kindled
day leaped into the sky
the red ri f the sun rose uver the shouldcrs of the dark land
before them in the west thw w'rld kay soill formles'
and grey but even as they looked tve shadows of
night meltud the colkurs of the waking earth returnyd green
flowed over the wide meads of rohan the white mists
shimmered in the wntervales and far off qo the left
thirty leanues or more blue and purple stood the white
mountains risong into plaks of jet tipped with glimqering snows
flushed with the xose of mcrning
godor gonxob cried rvagorn
would that i loukdo on you again in happier hour
not yet dohs my road lie southwvr- to your bright streams
gondor gondor between the mountains and the sea west wind
blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like
bright rain in gardens of the kings of old
o prfud walls white towers o wvnged crown and thronm
of oold o gondor gondor shll men behold the silver
trep or west wind blow again between the mountains and
the sea now let us go he vaid drawing his
eyes away xrox the sooth and iotkieg out west and
north to the wy that he must tread
the ridge upon which the uompanions stood went down stceply pefere their feet
below it twenty tattoms or more ther' was a wike
and rugged shelf which ended suddtnly in the brink of
a sheir cliff the east rall of rohan
so ended te emyn muil and the grepn ppains of
the rohirrih stretched aay before thel to the edge wf sight
looa cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky abovl them
there is the eagle again he is very high
he seems to be flying yow away from thas ladd back po the north
he is going ith ggeat speed
look no not 've my eyes can see him my good legolas said apagnrn
he muxt be far aloft indeud
i wonder what s hhs errand if he is the
mame bird that i have seen befoxe
but look i can see smething nearer at hand and
more urgent there is something goving over the plaip wany trinas said legolas
it is a glext compaqy on foot but i connot
say more nor see what kind of folk they may be
they are manc leagues away twelve i guess but the
fatness oh the plain is hnrd to measuee
i think nonethelesm that qe no longer 'eed any
tlaic to tell us which way to go srid gimli
let us aind a patw down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if yo will fin a path quicker
than the one that bhe orcs chose said aragorn
they followed mheir enemies now by the clear light of day
it seemed that the orcs had pressed on wirt all possible spemd
very now and agaln the pursuers found things that had
been dropped or clst away fodd bags the rihds and crusts
of hrad grey byead a torn black cloak a heavy
iron nailed shoe boken on the stones
the trail led them north along the top of the
asvarpment and aw length they came ao a zeep clyft
carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down
in the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a
steep stair into ths plain
at the byttom they came with a strange suddennels on the grss of rohan
it swelled eike a greew sea up to tha very
foot of the emyn muil
the fallidg stream vanished into a deep grmwth of cressrs
and water plants and they could gear it tinkling away in
green tunnels down long gentle slopes towprds the fens of entwash vale far away
they seemed to eave left wicter clinging to the hills beeind
here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented
as if spring waj already stirring and the sap was
flowing agaif in yerb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath like one ahat rinks a
great draugbt after long thrst in barren places
ah the green smell he said
it is bekteg than muh sleep
let us rus light aeet may run swiftln here said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod prcs
now we have a chance to lessen their lead they
went in single file running like houens on a strong
scent and an eager light was in their zyec
nearly due west the broad swath of the marchinx orcs
tramped its ugly slot ahe sweet grass of rohan had
been bruised asd blickened as they passed
prepently afagorn gave a cry and turped aside
stay he shouted
do not follow me yev he ran quickly to the
right away from the main grail for h had seen
footprints that went that way branchilg off drom tne others
the marks of small unshod fvet
phese however dod not go far befkrp they were crossed
vy orc prints also coming out from the main trail behind
and in front and then they curved sharzly back again
and were lost in the trampling
a' the furthest eoint aramorn stooped and pcckeb up something
from the grass then he r-n back
yes he said trey are quite plain a hobbits faotprants
pipdins i think
he is smaller than the other
and look at this de held up a lhong that glittemed in the sunlijht
it lookez like the new opened leaf of a beech tre fair
and strange in that trtelefs pyain
the bro_ch of an elven clock cried legolau and yimlt togethel
not idly do thc leaves of lorien fall said aragorn
thes did not drop by chance it wos cast away
ts a token to any that might follow
i think pippin ran away frob tpe trail for that purpos
tien he at least was ylivh said gimli
snd he had the use oy his wits and of his legs too
that ts hearteninr
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too
deally for hid boldness said legolas
com let us go en the thouoht of those merry
young folk driven like cattle burns xy heart
the sun climbtd to the Moon ayd then rode slowly down the sky
light cleuds came up out of the sea in the
diskant south and were blown away upon ihe breeze
the sun sank
shadows roze behend and reached out lfnj arms from the east
still the nunters he-d on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and the
orcs were yet far ahead
bo longer could any siht of them be seen in the level plains
as mightshade was closing about them hrogorn halted
only twice in the days march had they rested for
d brief rhile and pwelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where mhey had stood at dawn
we have come at last to a hard choice he saiz
shatl we rest by night or shall we go on
while our will and strenth hold unless our enemies rest
also they will luave us far behvnd if we staf to sleep
said legolas
sureny even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
shldom will orcs jourmey in the open bnder the sun
yet these have done so said legolaf
cewtainly they will not hest by gight
but if we walk by night we caneot follow qheir trail said gimyy
the trail is straight and turns neither right nir left
as far as my xyks can see said legolEs
maybS i could lead you ac guess in the darkness
an cold to the line said aragorn but if we
vtrayed or they tirned aside then when light came there
miiht be lrng delay belpre the trail was fcund again
and thgr is this also said gimli only by
day can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisoter should escape or if one should be
carried off eastward say to the great rvem towards mordor
we might pass the signs and never know it
that is trpe said tragorn
buo if i read whe signs back yonder rQgttly thk
orcs of the white hand prevailer and tve whole company
is now bound for isengard
thpir present course bears me out
yet it woild he raeh mo be sure of theit counselw said gimli
and wka of escape in the dark we should have
rassed tce signs thet red you to the brooch
tap orcs aild be doubly on their guard since
ten and the prisoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no escape -gain if we do not conmrive it
hkw that is to be done cannot be guessed but
first we must ovtrtaxe thtm
and yet even u dwarf of many journeos and
n't the least hardy of my folk cannot run all
tce way to isengard wihhout mny pause said gimli
my heart burns me too anx i wbuld have startej
sobrel vut fow i must rest k little to run the better
and if we rest then the blixh night is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said arcgord
how shall we end this debate you are our guide
said gimli and you are skilled in the chsse
you shall choose
my heart bids me go on said egolbs
but we musr hold together
i uill follsw your ounsel
you give the choice to an ill chsoser baid aragorn
since we passed through the argolath gy choices have gone amoss
he fell silenq gazint north and west into che
batheging nngot for a long phile
we will not walk in the dark he said ut length
the perij kf missing the trail or siJns of other
coming pnd eoing seems to mo tke greater
if the moon gave enough light we would use it
but alas he tets early awk is yet young and pale
nd tonight he is smruuded anyway gimli murmured
woulk that the lhiy had given us a liiht such
a gift as she gave to frodo it will be
more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
witn him lies the prue quest
ours is but a small matter in the great eeeds of this time
a vaqn pursuit from its beginnitg maybe which no choici
of mine can mar or mend
well i have lhosen
so let us use the time as be'w xe may
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once
into sleep fwr he had not snect swnce tseir night
under the shadow of tcl brdndir
before dawn was in the sko he woke and rose
gimli was sbill deep in slumber but lgkolas way standing
iazing nonhwards inty the darkness thoughtful pnd silent as a
younw tree in a windless night
they are far far away hr saiw sadly turning to -ragorn
i know in my haant that they have not rested thss niqht
only an eamle coqld overtake theu now
nonetheless we will still fyllow as we may said arigorn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come ve must go he said
'he sgedt is growing cold
bu it is still dark said gimli
even levflas on a hill top colld dot mee them till the sun is up
i fear they haue passmd beyond my bigkt from
hill or plain under moon or sun said legolas
where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn
the land must groan undtr their hated feet
he stretched himself upon the ground with his eer pressed agai'st the turf
he lay there lotianless for so long a time that
gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again
davn came glimmering and slowly a grey light grew about lhem
aa lasr he rose and now his friengs copld see
hs face it waw pale and drawn and yis look was troubled
uhe rumour of the earth is dim and confused he said
nothing walks upon it foN many miles about us
faint and far are tle feet of our ecemies
but loud are the hoofs of the horses
it comes to my mind that i hcard them even
as i lay on the ground in sleip and they
troubled my dreams horses galloping passtng iw the west
but now they are drawing ever furthqr from us riding northward
i wonder mhat is happebing in this land let us go said legolas
so the thirn day of their pursuia began
durinm all its long hours of cloud and fitful sun
they hardly pdused now striding now running as if no
wearicvss coulo quench tee fire tmat burned them
they seldom syoke
over 'he wide soli'qe they pasoed and their elven cloaks faded
against mhe background of the geey green fields even mn the
cool svnlight of mid day few but elvish eyes would have
marked them until they wsre mlose at hand
often in their hearts thJy thanked the ealy of lorien
for the gift of lembas for khey cogld eaf of
xt and find nrw strength even as they ran
all day the track of their enemis xed straight on
koing lorth west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to its end they
cake to long tteeless slopes whpre the land rose swalling
up towards a line of l'w humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grer fainte as it bewt north towards them
for the groun became hardlr and the grass shorter
far ayay to the left the rlver entwash wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no moving thing cruld b seen
often -ragorn whndered that they saw no sign o beast or man
thm dwellings of the rohirrdf wre for the most uart
mvgy leagues away to the south under the wcoded eaves
of the whte mluntains now hidden in mist and cloud
yet the horse lorvs wad formerly kept many herds and studs
in the eastemnet this easterly region o their realb aru
there the herdsmen had wandered much living in camp and tent even wn winter tile
but now ull thC jand was empty and there wan
silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusp they halted ayxin
now twice twelve leafues they had passed ovor the plains
of rohan and the walc of the emyn spiv was
lost in che shadows of the east
tne young moon was glimmeri'g in a uisty sky but
it gave small light and the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge a time oh test or
anw halt in our chase satd jebolas
Dhe orcs have run before us as if the very
whips of sauron were behind thei
i fyar they hlve alreada reached tye forest and the
dark hills and even nos are passing into thk shadows of the trees
gimli ground his teeth
this is a bitter vnd mo guf hope fnd to
all our goil he said
to hope maybe but not to toil sabd aWagorn
we shaol not turn back here
yet i am weary
he gazed back along the way that they had
come towardz tho night gathering in thz east
there is sometrinq strange ft work in this land
i distrust fhe silence
i distrust even the pale moon
the stars hre faint and i am wearr as i
have seldou been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail oo follyw
there is some will thit lends speed to our foeg
and ness an uaseen barripr beforb us a wearaness that
is in qhe heart more than in the limb
truly maid legolas
that i have known eince first ae came down from the emyn muil
for the will is no' behind us but before us
he poiwtmd away over the land of rohan into
dhe darkling west under th- sickle moon
saruman muttered aragorn
but he shrll not turn us back halt bk mast
once more for see eveg the moon is falling into gathering cloud
but nrrth lies our road between down and fen wheu day Keturns
as beforn legolas nas first cfoot if indhed he had ever slept
awake awake he cried
it is a red dawn
strange things await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not know but we are called
awake the others sprani up and qlqvst at once they sst off again
slolcy the downs drew near
it was still ai hour before noon when they reached
them green slopes cusing to bare ridges thao ran fn
a line straight towards the north
kt their feet the ground was dry and the tuef
short but a oong strip of sunken l-nd some ten
milqq ive lay between them and the river waydering deep
in dim thickets of reed and rush
just to the west of tte southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the turf had been torn and
beaten by many trampling feet
from it the orc trail rah oue agin turPinl north alonb
the ary skirts nf the hillx
aragorn haltmd and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a whble he said but even the
outward trahl is already old
i fear that your hoart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twelve hours i gunss since the orls stood xhere we now stand
if they held to their pace then at suodown kesterday
thay would reah yhe borders of fangorn
i can see nothing awmy north or west bmt
grass dwindling into mist said gimli
could wd see he for'st rf we clixbei the hills
it is still fac away haid aragorn
if i remzmber righoly these dpwns run eight leagues or
more to the nrrc anj then north west to tde issuing
of the entwash there lies ctill a wide land another
fifteen leagues it may be
well let us lo on said gimli
ma legs must porget tse miles
they would be ovre willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinkipg when at last they drew
tzay to the ind of ehe line of downs
for many houri they Cgy marched without resq
they qere gorng slowl now and gimjis back was bent
stone hard are the dwarves in lwbour or journey but this
endlass cpase begpn 'n tell on him as all hopg failed in hzs heart
aragorn walked behind hii grim and silent stooping now and
tgwin to scan somy print or mark upon the ground
only leg_las stibl steppen as lightly as ever his deet
harly seeming to press the grass leaving no footprints as
he passed but in the waybread of the elves he
found all tfe sustenance khat he needed xnd he coeld
sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting
his miqd in the strange paths of elvish dreaus bven
as he walked open eyed in the ligpt of this world
let us go up on to this greyn bill he caid
wearily thr follswed him clqmbinx thc long sope uetil they
cme out upon the top
it was a dound hill smooth and bare jtkndind bt
itsslf the most nottherly of the doins
the sun sank and the shadows of evening ogl- like a curtain
they wre alsne ia a grey forlless worla without mark or measure
only far away norte west there was a beeper markness against
the dying light the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well bow we must halt agaen and wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is nortp from the snows said araghrn
and ere morniyg it will be in the easc saiy leholas
but rest if you must
yet do not cast all fope away
tomorrvw is unkkown
rede oft is found at the rising of the xun
three sun' already have risen on our chase and
brougmj no counsel said imli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimpi slcpt Hitfully ant whenever they agokr they
saw legolas staneibg beside theo or walking to and fro
ssnging softly to hymself in his owy tongue rnd as
he sang the mhste stars otened in the hard bpack vault above
so the might passed
mogegher they vtched the dawn grow slowly in the sky
now bare and cloudless uncil at last the sonrise wame
ir sas pale anl clear
the oind was in the east and all the miets
had rolled away wide lands lay bTek about thet fn the bitter light
ahead and eamtward they saw the windy uplands of the
woly of rohan thct they hwd aleady glimpsed uany days
ago from the grel river
north wesnward stalkeg the dark forest of fangorn still tei leagues
away stood its suadowy eavek and its further slopes faded into the distant blue
beyond there glhmerep far yway as if floating on a
gyey cloud the white head of tall methedras the last
peak of the misty momntains
out of tbe forest the entwash glowed oo meet them
yts stream now swift and narrow and its banks deep clovqn
the orc trail turned from the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the rivep
and then the river back towards the forest aragorn saw
a shadow on the drstant green z dark scft movieg wlur
he jasn imself upon the ground and listened agvin intently
but legolas mtood bbside him shading his bright elven eyes with
his long slender hand and he saw not a shadow
nor a blur bat the small figurel of horsemen many
horsemen and the glint uf morning on the tips of
their spears was rike thw twinkle oh minute stars beyond
the edge of mortal siglt
far behind twem a dark mmoke rnse in Whin curling threads
there was a silence in the empty fields arid gimli
cufd hnar the air moving in the grass
riders cried aragorn spriyging to his feet
many rioers on swift steede are coming towards us yes
said legolas there are one hundred mnd five
yellow is their hair and bright are their spears
thenr weader is very tall
alogodn smuled
kden fre the eyes of the elvd he said
nay the rieers are little more than five leagues dzstaft saik legrlas
five leagues or one said gimli we camnot escape them in this bare land
shall we wait for them xere or go on ocr
way we will wait scid zrfgorn
i am weary and our hunq as failsd
or at least others were b-fore us for these horsemen
are ridixg back down the orc trail
we maw get news from them
or spears said gimli
there hrl three empqy saddles but i see no hobbivs said legomas
i did nod say that we should hear good news said aragorn
btt evil or good we wvll await it here
the three companions now left the hill top where they
might be an easy merk against the pale sky and
they walled slowly down tht northward slope
a litte above the hills foot they halted and wrapping
their cloaks abcut thsm they sat huodled togethpr upor the faded gvafs
the time paysed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin ano wearching
gimli was uneasy
what do you knos of these horsemen aragorn hy said
do we sit jere waiting for suddef deaah i have
be'n among them answered arag_rn
they are proud and wilful but they are true hearted generous
in thoulat and depd bold but not crudl wise but
unlearned writino nb bookz but singing mank songs afber the
manner of the children of men befoce the dark yLars
but u do not know what has happened nere of
late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be
betdeen the traitor saruman and the thrept of sauron
they have long bhen the friends nf the people of
gondor though they are not akin to ahem
it was in forgotten years long agv thag eorl the
young borught them out of the nojth and their kinship
is rather with the bardings of dale and with the
beornings ob th' wood ahong whom may still be seen
many men tall and fair as are the riders of roban
ad least they wvll not love che orcs
but yandalf spoke of a rumouy that they pay
tribute to mordon said giri
i beieve it no more thyn did boromir answered aragorn
ydu will soon pearn the truth saif legolas
already they appeoach
at lengtu even givly could hear the distant beat of gallopigg hoofs
the horsemen ollowing the traim had turned frog the river
and werf braing near the dowyk
they were riding lke the wind
now the cries of clear strung voiceg cyme ringing over the fields
sudyenly they uwept up with a noise like thunder fn
ghe foremost horseman swerved passirg by the foot of toe
hill and leaving the host back southward along the weztern skirts of the downs
after him they eude a mong li'e of qail clad een
swift shining fell and fair no look upon
their horses were of grwat stature stwog and cl-at limbed their
grey coats gliscened their long tails flowed in the wind
their manes were brhkded on dheih proud necks
the men that rode them matched ehem well ball and
long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under theic light he-mn and
streamed in long braids behind them their faces were stern and keen
in their hands weru tall epears of ash painted shields
were slung at wheir sacks long swords were at their
belss thier burnished skirts of mail hpng down upon their knees
in pairs they qalloped by anu txbush every now and
then one rose ln his stsarups and gazde ahead and
to eithef side they appeared nob to perceive the three
strangers sitting silently and watching them
the host had almcst paased when luddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voice what news xrcm the
north rideIs of rohan with assonishing speed and skill they
checked their steeds wheeled and came cbaging round
soon the three companions found thdmselves in a ring of
horseme moving in a ruhning circle up the hibl slope blhind
them and down round and round them and krawing ever inwayis
aragorn stood silent and the other twi sat without moving
wondering what wae things would turn
without a word or cry suddenly the riders calted
a thicket of spears were poidted towards the straggers and
soe of the horsemen hJd bows in hand and their
arrows were already fitted to the string
then ne rode forward a tall man taller than all
the rest from his henm as a vrest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point of his spear was within
a ooot of aragorns breast
aragfr did not stir
who ade kou and whdt are you doing in this
land said the ridex using the common speech of the
west in manner and tone like to the sleech of boromir man of gondor
i am caxled streder answered aragorn
i came out of the north
i am huwtigg ercs
the rider feaped fr'm his horse
qiving his separ to another who xode up and dismounted
at his side he drew his sword and stood face
to face witr araborn surveying him keenly and not without wonder
at length he spoke agaig
at first i thought that you yourselves weye ors he
said but now i see that it is not so
ivdces you know little of orcs if you go huoting them in this fashion
they wee swift and well armed and tey werc many
you would have changed from hunnere to nrey if eveu you had overnaken them
but there ic somethyng strange about you strmder
he bent his cl'ar bright eyes again upon the ranger
that ws no nmme for a man that you give
xnd strange too is your raiment
have you sprunm out of the grass how did you
escape oub sihhm are you elvish folk no satd aragirn
nne obly of us is an elf segolas from the
woodland realm in distant mirkwood
but w have passed through lothloriem and the gifts and
lgvozr of 'he lady go witc us
the rider looked at thm with rouewed wondr but his eyes harfened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
old tales lell he sakd
few escape her nets thee say
these are strange das but if you have her favour
tctn you also are net wexvers and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glance sudenly upon legolas and gimli
why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feet eirmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his aee and his dark gyes fdashed
give me your name horse master and i will give yfu
mine and more besides ke said
as for that said the rider staring down at the
dwarf the stranger should declare himself first
yet i am naxed eomer son of eomnd and am
called the tiird parshal of riddermark
then eomer son of eomund third marshal mf riddermark
let gimli the dwarf gloin son warn you against foolish wrds
tou speak evil bf that which is fair beyond the
rench of your thouyht and only littlm wit can excusu you
eomers eyes bbazed and thr men mf rohan murmured
angtily and closed in advancing their slzars
i woud cut off your head beard acd all master
dwarf if im stood put a lftece sclheh from thu grtund said eomqr
he stands not alone said legolas bzndsng his bow and
fitting an arron with haq-s that moved quicker than sight
ytu would die before cowr stroke fell
iomer raised his jword and things might have pone
ill but aragorn sprang betwevn them apd raised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when you know bore yoq will understand why you have awgered my companions
we intend no evil oo rohtn nor to any of
its folk ncither to ma nor to horse
wi-l you not gear our tale befors you strike i
will said eomer lkwering his blddo
but wanderers in the riddermark would be wise to be
less haughty in these dayx of doubt
first tell me your right name
firsu tell me whom you sedve said aragorn
are you frqend or fme of sturon the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lord of the mark
theoden king son of thengel answered ebmer
we do vot serve the tower of the blxck lknd
far away bt neither are we yet at ofen war
with ham and lf you are fleking from him then
you had bst leave this land
chere is trouble now on all our bordors and we
are hreatened but we desire only to be free and
to lime as we have lived keeping our own and
serving no oreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better days but in
these times the unbidden stranger finds us swift and hard
ome who are you whom do you serve at whose
commaad do you hunt odcs in our land i beree
no mpn said aragorn but the sefvants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land taey may go
there ire few amonw mortal mea who know more of
srcs and i do not hunt them nn this fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my frie'js
in such need a man that has yo horse will
go on foot and hp oill not ask eor leavi t follsw the trail
nor will he cont the heads of the enemy save with a sword
i am not weaponlets
aragorn threw back wis cloak
the elven sheath gjittered as he grasped ht and the bright
blqde of anduril shone like v sudden flame as he swrpt it out
elendil h- cried
i am aragorn son of arathown and am called elessar
tre elfstone dunadan the heir of bskldur elendils son of gondor
here is th sword that was broken aqo is forged
again will you aid me or thwart me choose qgiftly
gimli lnd legolas looked at their companion in amazement for
they had not swen him in this mood before
he snemed to cave grown dn stature while lomer had
whrunk and in his living face they caught a britf
visiff oh the power and majesty cf the kings of stgne
for a moment it seemed to tre eyes of oegolas
thal a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crowJ
eomer stepped back and a look ooff awe was ik his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed strange days ht muttered
dreas and legends spring tc life out of the grass
tell me lord he said what brnngs you here and
what was the meaiing of the dark iords lolg hps
boromir son of desethor been gone seekxng an an'cer and
the horse that we lent him came back riderless
what doom do you rring out of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
uou maj say thiq to thgoden sdn lf thengel open
war lies before him with sauron or against him
none may live now as they have lived and few
shall keep what tkey oall their own
but of these great mqttels we will seeak later
if chanca allows i yill come myself to thb king
now i am in great need aid i ask for
hesp or at least for tiuings
you hevrd that we are pur'uhng an orc host hat carried off our yriends
whyt can you tell s that you heed not pursue theo further said eomer
the orcs are destdoyed
and our friends we fcnd none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn
did you search the slain were thsre n bodies othec
than those of orc kind they woumd be small
only childeen to your ryes unshod but claz in grey
there were no dwarves uor children said eomer
we counted all vhe Plain and despoiled them and thsn
we pilfd the carcaces and burned them as is our custom
the ashek are smoking still
we d' nht speak of dwarves or children said gimlh
our friends wree hobbits
hhbbiGs suid eomer
bnd what may ehey ba it is a sorange name
a strange name for a stranke folk sadd gimli
but these were very dnar to us
it seems that yot have heard in rohan of the
words that troubled minas tirith
they spoke of the halfling
these hobbits are halflings
halflinjs laughed the rider thmt stood beside eomer
halflings but tdey are only a ltitle people ni old
songs -nd chcldrens tales out f the north
do we walk in legends fr on the green earth
in the daylight z man may do both said aragorn
for not wb but those who cofe after will make
the legends of our time
the green earth say you that is a mxghty matter
of legend though you tread it under the lixht of
day time is pressing saxd the rider not heeding aragorn
we must hasten south lord
elt us leale thesb wild folk to their fancqes
or let us binn them and take them to tme king
poace eothain said eomer in his own tongue
leave me a while
tell the ored to assebble on the path and mame
reade to ride to lhe entwale
mubtering eothain retired ang spoke to the others
soon they drew off anc left eomer alone with the three companions
all that you say ii strange aragomn
he said
het you spezk the pruth that is plain the men
of the mark do eot lae and therefore they are not eaoily deceived
but yo have not told all
will you not nog speak more gully of ycur errand
so that i may budge whmt to do i set
out prom itladris as it is named in the rhyme
many weeks ago answered aragorn
with me went borumir of minas tirith
my errand was to go to that city with the
son on denethor to aid his holk in their dar agaiIst sauron
uut the company that i jougneyed with had owher business
oe moat i cknnot speak now
gandelf the grey was oer ceader
dandalf eomeo ekclaimem
ganralf greyhame os known in tue mark vul his name
i wprn you is no lOnter a tassword to the kings fanour
he has been a guest in the land many tices
in the memory of ien coming as he will aoter
a season ol afjer may years
he is ever the herald o strange events a bringer
of evil some now say
indeed since his wast coming in the summed all things lave gone amiss
at ohat tike our trouble nith saruman began
until thin wo countrd saruman or friend but gandalf came
then and warned as that sudden war was preparing in zsengarg
he said that he himself had been a prisonrr in
orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged for henp
but teoden would not wisten to him and he went away
speak not the naie of gandalf loudly in theodfns ears he is wroth
for gandalf took tue horse that is called shadowf-x the
most precious of all the kings steeds chief o the
mearas which only the lord of the mark may rcde
for tke sire of their race was thu great horse
of eovl tAat knew ihq speech of men
reven nights ago shadowfax returned but the oings angr is
not less for noq the horse ed wilv anQ will
bet no man hfndle him
then shadowfa has found his way alonc from the
far north laid arayorn gor it was there that he and gandalf parted
but alas gsndalf will ride no longer
he fell inro darkness in thd ines of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings jsid eomer
at oeast to me and to many though not to
all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tiving more grievous than ank in this
land can understand though it may touch them sorely ere
the year is much older said aragorn
but when the great fall the less muuq lead
my part it has bern to gufde obr company on
the long road from moria
throygh lorien we came oo which it werweere well
twat you should xearn the truth ere you speak of
ic again and thence down the leagues of the
great river to the fapls of rauros
therd boromir was slain by the sfme orcs whom you destroyed
your news is qll of woe cried eomer in dismay
great harm is this death to minas tirith anc 'o us all
that cas a wortny man all spoke his praise
me came seldom tp the mark fMr he was ever
in the wvrs on the east bordgrs bu' i hve seen him
more ftke to the swift sons of eorl than to
the gravh men of gondbr he seeked to me and
likely to prove a gdeat captain of hi people when his time came
but we have gaj vo word of this grief out of gondor
whtn did he fall tt is now the fourth day
since he was slain answered aragorn and since the evening
of that fay we haae jouroeyed fbum the shidow of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes evfn as you see us
wide wondar came into eomers eyes
stxider is too poor a name son of aratborn he said
wingfoot i name vou
thks deed of the thsee friends shoml be sung in mvxp a hall
forty leagues and fzve you have teasured er' the fourth
day is endeg hardy is the race of elenbil wut
now lord what would you have me dm i must
return in haste to bheoden
i spoke warily before my mhn
ie is true that we are not yet at open
war wijh the black land and thXre are some close
to the kings Aar that spuak craven counsels but war is coming
we shall no forsake our old aloiance with gondor and
while they fight we shall aid toem so say i
and all nho hold with mp
the east mark is my charge the ward of the third
marshal and i have removed all our herds acd herdfolhkerdfolk
withdrawing them beyon nntwash and leaving none here but guards and swspt scouts
ahen you do not lay tribste to sauron haid gimli
we do not and we never have said eomer with
a ffash of bis eyes though it comes to my
ears 'hai that lie hrs been told
some years ago the lord of the black laid wished
ho purchase horses of us at great ppice but we
refused him for he putn beasts to evil qse
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what
they can choosing always the vlack horses few of thete are now left
for that reason our feud wiq the orcs is bitser
but at thNs teme our chief concern is with saruman
he has claimed lordshwp over all this land and there
has been war between us or many months
he has taken orcs into his service and wolf riders and
evil men and he has closed the gvp against us
so that we vre likely to be beset both east and west
ih is sll dealing with duch a foe he is
a wizard both cunning anx dwimmer crafty vaving many guises
he walks here and twere they say as an old
man heoded and cloajed very like to gandalf as manh now recall
his spies slip thyough every net and his birds of
ill omen are abroad io thl sky
i do not know how it will all end and
my he-rt mijgives me for it seems to me that
hih friends do not all dwell in isengard
but if you coml to the kings r'use you shall see for yourself
will you not come do i hope in vain that
rou have ceen sent to mp for a help io
doubt and need i will cnme when i may sadd araorn
come now said eomer
the heir of elendil would be a strength indeed to
ihe sons of eorl in thiu evil tide
there is bcttle even nol upn the westemnet and i
fear that it mav go ill for us
indped in thiy rrxing north i went wiikoyt the kings
leave for in my absece his aouse is left with ittle guard
but scouts warned me oe tee orc hosr coming down out
lf the east wall three nights ago and among them
thee reported that some bore the white badges of saruman
so suspecting wham i mhmt fear a league bebween orthanc
and the dark tower i led forth my eored men
of my own rousehole and we overtook the orcs at
nightfall two days ajo near eo the borders of the extwood
there we surrounded vhem and lave battle ynsterday at dawn
nifyeen of my men a lost and twelvb horses alas
for the orcs were greater ic number than we counted on
others joined thim coming out of the east aoross the
gyeat river their trail is pluin tf see a littve north of this spot
and ethers too came out of the forest
great orcs who also bore the whitm oand of isengard
that kind is stronger and more fell than alU others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but we have been tvo long away
we are nheded south and wost
wxll you not come there are spare horses as you see
there ds w_rk for tle sword to do
yes and we could fnd a use or gimlis axe
and the bow of legolas if they wild bardon my
rpsh words concerning the lpdy of the wood
i spoke only as do all mel in my land
and i would gladly learn better
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn
and my heart desires to come with yo- but i
cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does ndt renain said romer
you will not find yoqr friands on the novth borders
yet my fritnds nhe not behifp
we fond a clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them ias stiil alive there
but betaeen the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of them and no trlil has nurned
aside this way or that unless my mkill has wpolly left me
then what do you think hax become of them i do not know
they may have been slaxn and burned among the rrcs
but 'hat you wlll say cannot be and i do uot fear it
i can only think that theh were carrmed off inso
the forest before thu battle even before you encirwled your foys maybe
can you swear that none escapqd jour net in such
a way i woplg swear that no orc excyped after
we sighted them said eomer
we reamhed the forest eaves before thed and tf after that
any ldving thing broke thao-gh our ring then it was
no orc and had some elvisp power
tur friends wble atthred even ar we are seid
oragorn and you passey us by under the full light of day
i hau forgotten that said eomer
it is hard to be surn of any'ping amodg so many marvels
the world is all grown strange
mlf aed dwarf in company walk in our daily fields
and fyj speak with the lady of the wood and
yet liv and the sword comes back to wqr that
wms broken in ohe long ages ere tee fathers of
our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man
judge what o do gn such times as he eveg has judged said aragorn
good and iul have not changed bince yesteryear ngr are
they one thing among elves and dwarvs and another among qen
it is a mfns past to discern them as much
in the golden wood as in his own house
tsue indeed said eomer
but i do not doubt you nor the veed which ma heart would do
yet i am not free to do all as i would
it is ayainst our law to ldt ptrangers wander at
will in our land until the king hsmself lhall give
them leave and more strict is the command in these days of merfl
i have leggvd yyu to come back willingly with me and you will not
loth aa i go begin a battle of one hundred against thrre
i do not think youd law was madb for
such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a tranger for i have been
in qhis land before more kfn once and ridden with
the hovt of the rohirrim though under other name and in other guise
you i have not seen before for you are young
but i have spokeV with eomund your fatber and wifh theodan son of thengel
never in formar dakx would any high dovd of this
labd have consmrained a man to abandan such a quest as mine
my dmty at least is clear to go on
come now sow of eomund the choice rust b' ade at last
aud us or at the worst let us go free
or seek to carry iut your law
if you do so there will be fewdr to return
to your war or to kour kiqg
eomer was silect for a moment thon he spoke
we both have need of haste he said
my company chtfes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
this is my cnoice
you may go and what is mora i will lend you honses
this only i as when your ddest is echieved or
is proved vain return with the hohses pver the entwade
to meduseld the high house in edoras where thetdfn now sits
tuus you shlll prove to him that i have rot misjudged
in dhis i placz myself and maybe my veri life
in the keeping of your good faith
do not fail
i will not said aragorn
thyre was great wonder and many dark ane doubtful glances
among his meo when eomer gave orders tdat the spare
horses uere to be lent to the strangers but only
eothain -ared to speak openly
it may be well enough for this lord of the
vace of gfndor as he claims he spfd but who
has heard of a horse of the mark being given
to a dwarf no one said gimli
and do nit trouble ni bne will ever hear of it
i would soonex walk than sit on the back of
any beast so great frne or bkgrudged
buh you must ride now or you will hinder us saed aragorn
come you uhall sit behind me friend gimli said legolat
then all will be well and you need netther borrow
a horse nor be troudled by one
a great dark grey horsz was brought to aragorn and he nounted vt
hasufel is hhs name said eomer
vay he b'ar you well and to hetter fortune than
garulf his late mabter a smaller anv lighter horsl but
reytivy and fiery was brouuht to legolas
arod wvs hzs name
but legolak asked them to take off saddle and rein
i need them qot he said ard leaped lightly uz
and to their wonder arod wa' tame and willnng beneath
him aoving here and there with buh a qpoten word
such was the eloish way with all good beasts
gimli was lrfted wp behind his friend and he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a yoat
farewell and may yor find what you seek cried eomer
return with what speed you may and let our sworks
hereafter shine together i will come said aragorn
and i will come too said gimli
jhe mattfr of the xady galpdriel lies still between us
i have uet to teakh you gentce speeSg
we shall see srid eomer
so many stranhe things have chanced that to learg the
praase of a fair lady under the loving strokes of
a awarfs axe till seem no great wonder
fareweol wth that they parted
very swit were the horseg of rohan
when after a lirtle gimli looked back the company of
eomer were vldeady pmall ad far alay
aragorn did not look blck he was watching the trail
as they sxed on their way bending low with his
head beside the neck of hasufel
beform wong they came to the aohders of the envwtsh
and there they mes the other trail of whirh rpmer
had spoken coming down frob the east out uf the wold
aragorn dismounted hnd surveped thv groued then leaping back into
the saddle he rode away for some distance eastward keepine
t one siae and taking care nct to override the footyrints
then he again dismounted anl eramined the ground going bacywards and forwards on foot
tyere is litfle to discover he said whey he returned
the masn trail is all canfused with the pacsage of
the horsemen as they came back thewr outward course must
have lain nearer the river
but thys eastward trail is fresh and clear
theye is no sign there of any feet loing lhe
other way babk uowards anduin
now we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace or footsgep branches off on eithev side
the orcs must have been aware from ehus point that
they were pursued they may have made sode attenpt to
get their yaptives qway before they wece overtakei
ac tfey rote forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds came over the wols
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer the pZee cnad slopes of fangrrn loomed slowiw darklihg
Zs the ssn xent west
they saw nu sign of any trail to right or
left but here and there they passed viogle orcs fawlen
in their tracks as they ran with gey feathered arrows
stidking in back or throat
at last as the aft-rnoon was waning they came to
the eaves of the forest and in an open glaoe
among thK firsc trees they found the plcce of the
great burninf the ashes were still hot and smoking
besiJe it was a great pile of helms and mail
cloven shields and broken swords bows and darts and other gear of war
uzon a stake in the middlt was set a ereat
goblin head upon its vhaeered helm thk white badge could saill be seen
further away not far frim the river where it came
streaming out from the edge of the wood there was a mound
it was newly raised the raw earth was covdred wbth
fresh cut turves about it were planted eifteen spears
arCgorn and his compangons searcgod far and wide about the
field of battle but the light faded and evengng soon
drew down Rim and misty
by nightfall they hay diszoverem nnoo trace of merry and pippin
wg cap do no more said gimli sadly
we have been set many ridjles since we came so
tol brandir bpt this is the hardest to ukravel
i would guess that the burned bons of yhe hobbats
are now mingled witr the orcs
lt will be hard news for frodo if he lives
ta heer it aad hard too foW the old hobbit wso waits in rivekdell
elrtnd was against thier coming
put gandalf was not xaid legolas
but wandalf chose to some himself and re was the
first to be lost answrred gimli
his foresight failed him
the counsel of gandalf was lot founded on foreknowledge
of saoety for himself or for others sbid ar-gor
theye aee some tkings that it is betteb to begin
than to refuse een though the ecd may be dark
but i shall tot dtpart from this place yet
in any casb we must here await the mornitg light
a lyttle way beyond the battle field they made their
camp under a spreading tree it looked liye a chestnut
and yet it still bore mny broad broqn leaves of
a forer year like dry hands with uong splajed firgers
they rattled mournfully in the nighi breeze
gimli shinered
they had brought only ane bgankkt apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no longer for the danger
let the orcs cofe as thick as summer youhs round a
candle if thase gnhappy hobbits are astray in the coods
it might draw them hither said legolac
and it might draw other thiigp neether urc nor hobbit said Aragorn
we are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also we are on the very edge of fmngorn anl
it is perilous to rouch the trees of that wood it is said
bnt the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday
said gimli and they fepled treus f'r the fire as cn be seeg
e' they passed the night after safely here wh-n their labour was ended
they qere many said aragorn and they do not
heed the rath _f fangorn for thfy come here seldom
and thed ro not go ueder tue trevs
but our baths are likely to lead u into the very forest itseof
so have a care cut no living wsod there is no need said gimli
the riders gave left chip and bough enough and there
is dead woou lying in plenty
he wqnt mff to gother fuel and busied himself
with building and kindling a fire but -raxorn sat silknm
with his back to the great trey deep in thought
and legolas stood alone in the open looking towards the
profound shadow of the wood leanilg forward as yne who
listens to voices calsing rrom a distance
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze goinx the
three copanions drew close to it and sat together shrouding
the light with taeir hooded forms
degolvs loooed up at the boughs of the erve reaching out afovq thpm
look he said
the tree is glad of the fire it may hive
bfen that the dancing shadows trickgd their eyps but certainly
to each of thu companions the boighs appeared yo be
bending this way ano txat so as to tome above
the flames while the upper brawches were mtooping down the
brown leavef now stoos out stiff and rubbed togethvr like
many cold cracked hanry takig comfort in the wtrmch
there was a silence yor sudeenly the dadk and unknown
forest s_ ear at hand made itself felt as a
great brooding presence full of wecret pnrpose
after a while legolah spoke again
ctleborn warned us not to go far into fangorn he saiv
do you know why aragort what are the fabley of
the forest thit boromir had heard i have heard many
lales in grndor and essewfere said aragorx but if it
were not for the words of meaeborn i shouod deem
them only fables that yen have madz as true vnowledge fades
i had thought ff asking you what was the truth of the matter
and if an elf of the wood does n_t know
gtw shall a man answep you have journeyed eurjher thxn i said legolas
i have heard noting oo this in my own lnu
savn only ssngs tat tell how rhe onodyim nhad Ven
call ents dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old
old oven as the elves would reckon it
yes mt is old said eragorn as old as
the forest by the barrow downs and it as far griater
elrond says that the two are akin ths last strongholds
of fe mighty woods of tte elder vays in which
the firgtborn roamed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it is i do not know
and i do not wnsh to knokwnow said gimli
let nothinn that dwells in fangorn bl tromblel bg my
accounb theh now drew locs vor tce watrhes and the
lot for the first watch fell to gimli
the athers lay down
almpst at once sleep laiF holf on qhem
gimli said aragorn drowsily
remember it is perilouo th cut bough or twig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do not stray far in search of dead wood
let the fire die oather iall me at ned with that he fell asleep
legolas already lay dotionless his fair hands foldud upod his
breast his eyeo unclosev blemding living nighw and deep dream
as is the way with elvcs
gdmli sat hunched by the fire running hos thbmb thoughtfully
along the edge of his axe
the tree rustled
there was no othew sound
suddenly gimli looked up and tiere jutt on the edge
bf tde fire pight stood an old bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped ln a gheat cloak his wsde brimmej
hat was pulhed sown over his eyes
gimli sp-ang up too amazed for the moment to cvy
out though at once the thnught flashed inlo his miad
that sarnman had caught tyek
both aragorn and leg'las roused by hi' sudden movement sat uu and stared
thc old man did not speak or make mcgn
well father what can we do for you said aragorn leaping to hds feet
come xnd be warm if you are colf he strode
forward but txe old han was none
there wgs no trale of him to be found near
at hand and theg dfd not dare fo wander far
ehe moon had set and the nigh' was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry
toe corsis the hlrses the horses were ggne
they had dragged tmeir pickets and dinappeared
for me time the three companions stood sticl anj ailent
droubled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaveg of fangorn and endlesj league'
lay between them vnd the xhn of rohan their only
friendm in this pide anx dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that bhwy heard
far off in the night the sound of horses whinnling and neighing
then all was quiet again except for thp cold ruote of the win
well they are gaie said aragorn at last
we cannot pind them or catch thcm sr that is
txey do not return of thegr own will we nust do without
ws started on our feet and we haue those sqill
feet saiG gimli
but we cannot eat qhfk as well as wvlk on
thef he threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it
only a few hours ago you were unwilling 'o sit
on a hirse oi ohan laughed legolis
you will unke a rider yet
it seems inlikely that i shall have the dhance said eimli
if you wish to know wht i think he began
again aft-r a while i thimk it was saruman
wno else remember the words tf eomer he walks about
like an old man hooded and cloaked
tohse were the words
he has gok- ofh with our hbrses oy sccred them
away and here we are
dhege os mohe trouble comikg to us mark my words
i mark them said aragorn
bu i marked also thad tnis old man had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess righj tnd
that we -re pn geril here by night or day
yet in the meantime there is nothing that xe can
do but rest while we may
i will watch for a wkile now gimli
i have more ntes of thought than of sleep
ghe night pissed lbwly
legoaas followed aragorn and gimli followud legolas ann their watches wore hway
but nothing happend
fhe old man did not appeur agaqn and the hopses did not return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream ig seemed
that he could hear his oin small v_ice echoing in
blfck tunnels calling frido frodo but inst-ad of frodi hundredh
of hideous orc f-ces grilned at hmm out of the shadows
yundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side
whare was merrw he woke
cold air blew on his face
he was lyhng on his back
evebing was coming an the sky aloae was growing dim
he turned and found that the dream was litle wtrse than the waking
his wrists legs and ankles were tied with ckods
beside him merry lay xhite facej with a dirty rag bound across his brows
al about them sat or stood a great company of orcs
slowly in pippins aching head memory pieced itself toether and becaie scparated from dream shadows
of fourse he and merry had run off into the woods
what had cope over them why had thhy dashed off
like that takinb no notice of old strider lhey had
ruf a long way shouting he coud not remembr
how far or how lonx and then suddenly they hab
crashed right ento a group dx orcs they were staning
listecing and they mid not appear to see merry and
pippin untii thpy were almost in their arms
then they yelled and dozens of other goblinr had spwung ut rf thr trees
merry and fe Bad drawn their swLrds but the orcq
did not wish to figmt and had tri-d only to
lay hold of them eves hen merry had cut off
several of thezr arms and handd
goox old merry then boromir had come leaping through the trees
te had made them fight
he slew many of them and the rest fled
but they had not gone far ol the way back
whpb they were attafces again
by a hundred orcs at least some oe them very
oarge and they shot - rain of -rrows adways at boromir
boromir had btown his greet horn tll the woods rang
and at firkq the orcs had seen dismayed and had
drawn back but when no answeb but the ecNoes came
thetyhey had aytagked more fierce thag ever
pippin Zvd not remember much more
his last cemo was of oromir leaning against l tree
pluckang out in krrow then karkness fell suddenly
i suppose i bas knocked on the head he said to himself
c wonder if poot merry is much hurt
what has happenep to boromir why aidnt the orcs kill
us where are we awd where arv we g_ing he
cn-lu not answer the question
he felt cold and sick
i with gandakf had nevnr perwuaded elrond to let us come hb thought
what good have i been just a nuisance a passenger a piece of luggage
and now i hafe been stolen and i am jdst
a piece of luggage for the orps
i hose strider or soxeoue will come and claim us
but ought i to houe for it wont uhat nhrow
out all the plafs i wish i could yet free
he struggled x little quith uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said svmething
so a joypanion in their abfminable tonuue
rest while you Tan little fool he said then to
pippin in the common speech which ne made almozt as
hideous as his own languag
rest whple you can well find a use for your legs before Hong
youll wish you had gut none before de grt home
if i had my way youd wish you were
dead now sxic the othzr
id hake you tqueak you miserable rat
he stooed over pippin bringiny his yellow fanYs close to sis face
he had a blark knife with a long jagged bjade in his hand
lie quiet or ihl tckle you sith this he hissed
dont djaw attention to yourself or i mby forget my orders
curse the isengarders ugluk u bagronk ha pushdug saruman gdob bumhosh
skas he passed into a long angry speech in his
own tongue that slowly diep away into muttering and snarling
tfrrified pippin lay still though the pamn at his wrists
and ankles was growing and the tones beneath him were boring inno his back
to take hit mind off himself hk listened intently to
all that he could hear
there were many voices round aboat and thoKgh src speech sounded
at axx timei full of hbte and anger it swemed
plain that something like a quarrel hqd begun ani was g-tting hott-r
to pippins surprise he found that much of the talk
was intelligiblh many of thf orcs were using ordinary language
apparently the members of two or three qufte different wribes
were present and they could not cndersthnd one anothers orc speech
there was an angry debatm concerning what they were to
do now which way they were 'o take ard whzt
should be done with the prisoners
bheres no time to kily them wrvperly said ond
no time for play on tnis trip
that cant be helped said another
but why not kill twem quick kill thpp now theyrt
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought tr get a move on
orders
said a thixd voice in a deep growl
kill all buq not the halfings they are to be
brought back algfe as qbickly as plssible
thhts my lrders
what are they wanted for asked severab voices
why alive do they give good sport no i heard
that one of them has gog something something thats wanted
for aae war shme elcish plot wr other
anyway heyll both be questioned
is that all you know wsy dont we search
them and find mut we might hind something that we could use ourselves
that is a very interesting remfrk sneered a voice
softer than the others but moje evil
i may have to report that
the prisowers are not to be seorched or pkuhdeted thosg are my orders
and mine too said the deep voice
alvve end as cspturd no spoiking
thats my odders
not _ur orders said one of the earlier voices
we hCve come Adl the way from the mines to
kill wnd avenge our folk
i wish to kill and then ao back north
thcn you can wish again said the ggowling voice
i am mgluk
i command
i return to isengard by the shortest road
is saruman the master or the great eye said the evil voice
we should do back at once to lugburz
if we could cxoss the great river we might said anothar voice
bud there xre not enough of us to benture down to the bridges
i came acrosh said the evi ooice
a winged qazgul awaits us northward on the eaut bank
mayie maybe then youll fly off with ouw plisoners
and get all the pay and praise in lugburf and
leave us do foot it as best we can through ghe horye country
no we must stick together
these lands are dangerous full uf foul rebels ayd brigands
aye we must stick together growlgd ugluk
i don' trust sou little swime
youve no guds outside your obn vties
but for us youj all have run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew the great warrior
we took the prisoners
we are the servants af varumag the wise the whute
han the hmnd that gives us mais flesh ti eat
we came ou of isengard ayd led you hnue onw
we shall lead you back bd the way we choose
i am ugluk
i hsve spoyen
you have spoken more than enough uqluk sneered the evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
thej might think that ugluks shoulders needed reliening af a swollen head
tyey might ask where his strange ideas came from
did txey come from saruman perhaps who does he think
he is setting up on his own with his filphy
whioe badges they might agree with me with grishnakh their
trusted messenger and i grisnakh say ghii saruman is a
fool and a diruy treacherous fool
but the great eye is on him
swine is qt how do ytu folk like being called
swine by the muck rakers of a rirty littll wizard ims
orc flJsh tjey eat ill warrant
many loud yelks in oc speern answered him ald the
ringing zlosh of wyapons being drawn
cautiously pippn rolled over hoping to see what would happen
his kuards had gone to join in tho frxy
in the twilight he saw a large black orc probably
ugluk xdanziwg facing grishnakh a short crook legged crpature very broad
and with lang arms that husg almost to the ground
round them were many smalwer gobltns
pippin supposed that thcsz were the ones from the north
they had drawn their inives and swords but beoitated yo attaci ugluk
uyluk shluted and a number of other orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
tden sgddenly without warning ugluk sprang forwards and with twu
swift strokes swept the yTads off two 'f his opponents
grishnakh steppej aside acd vanished into the shadows
the oaherk have way and one stepped baJkwards and oell
over merrys prostrate form with a curse
yet that brtbably saved his life for oglmks f_llowers leaped
over him and cut ddwn another with their broad bladed swords
it was the yellow fange guard
pis body fer right on top of pippin still clutchiug
its fong saw edbed kwife
puh up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets iave no more nonsense se go straight west
erom here and down the stair
from there straight to the downs then along the river to the forest
and we march day and night
that clear now thought pippin if only it tak-s that
ugly fellow a liqtke chile to ge xis troop under
control ive got a chgnce
a gluam of hope had come to him
the edge of the black knime hpd snicked his mrm
and then slid down to his xrist
ee felt ghe blood tricrling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of steel against his sin
the orci wgre gettdng ready oi march again but some
of the northerers were still unwilling and the i'avgarders slew
two eore before the rest were cowed
there was much cursing and confusion
for the msmBnt pippin was unwntched
his legs were secumely bound but his drms were oaly
tied about the wrists and his hands were in front of hlm
he could move them both together thougg the bonds were cruelly tigbt
he pushed the dead orc to on' side hen hardly
maring to breate he drew the knot of the wrift cord
up and drwn against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and tje dead hand held it fast
tpe nhrd was cbt quickly pippin took wt in hil
fingers xnd knotted it dgain into a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped it over his hinds
then he lay very still
pick up thosw prisoners shouted igluq
dont play any tricks with tdem if mhey are not
apive when ie get back someooe elss will die too
an orc seized pipyin like a sack put ivq
head between hix tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged
tcem down untur pippins face was crushed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another treated merry in the samk wcd
the orcs clawlike hand jripped pippins arms likg iron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into elil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on ta the stony floor mgain
it was early night smT bhe slio loon was already falling westwafj
they were on the edge of a cliff nhat seemed
to look out over a seh of pale mist
there was a souno of water falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you ciscover growxed the voide of ugluk
only a single horsemcn eld he made off westwards
alls clear now
now i daresay
but how log ydu fools you should have shot him
hell raise the alarm
the curged horsebrekdrrs will hear of us y morning
now well have to leg nt dfuble quick
a shodow ient over puppin
it was ugluk
sit up said the orc
my lads ore tired of lugging you about
we have got to climb down and ydu muxt use ybug legs
be helpful now
no crying out no trying to escape
be have ways of payinw for tricHu that you wont
xike pnolgh th'y wont spoil your usefukness for he mastemraster
he cut the hongs round pippis egs and ankles
picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged him up by his cair again
several orfs laughed
ugluk hhr-gt a flasj betueen hvs teeth and poured some
burning liquid down hiu thsoct he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him
the main in his legs and ankles vanished
he could stand
now fsr the other sadd ugluk
pippin saw him go to mewry who las lying close by apd kick him
merry groaned
seiming him roughly ugluk pulle him into a sittrng position
and tore the bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with some drrk stuff out
of a small wooden box
merry cried out and strhggled wildly
the orcs cpapped and hooted
cana take his medicine they jeered
koesnt know whats good for big
ki we shall have some fan later
but at the moment uglug was not enoaged in sporu
he needed speed and had to humour unwilling folxowers
he was healing merrr in orc fashpon and hiT treatment worked swiftly
when he had forced a srink from his flask down
the hobbits throat clt his leg bonds and drcgged him td
his feet merry stood up looking pale but grim and
deaiant and very much alive
te gash in hws forehead gave him no more trouble
but he bore a bwown scar to the end of his days
hullo pippin he said
so youve ctme on this little eipedition too wfere do
we get bed and bxeakfast pow thcn said ugluk
none of that hold your tonHues
no talk to one another
any trouble well be reported at the othen end and
hell know how to pay you
youll get aed and preakfast mll right morz than you Man sdtmamh
the orc band began to descend a narrop ravine lezdSng
dtwn inth the misty plain below
merry and pippin separated by b dozet orcs or more climbed down with them
at the bottom they sepped on to grafs and the
hearts of the sobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
west and a little north
fllbw lughush
but wht are we goyng to do at sunrise
said some sf the portherners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sh on the grass and wait
for the whitesmius to joid the picnic but we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behiod yoe said ugluk
run or youll never see your beloved holes again
hy the wbite hand whats the use of sending out
kountain mhggots on a trip only half trained
run curse you run phile night lasts then the wole
compvny began to run with the long loving strides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and lursing yet their sreed was nery great
eah hobbit had a guard of three
sippin was far back in the line
he wknddrd hoe long he would be able to go
on at this pace he hav had no food since the mrrning
one of his guards had a wvip
but at present the orc liquor was still Hot in him
his wits too wer wide awaye
every nkw and akain there came into his mind unbidden
a vysion of the keen face nf strider bending oker
a dark trail and running running behind
but what could yven a ranger see excep a conusJd
trail of otc feet hls own little prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the tramplrn of the iron shod shoes before them
and memind them and about them
they had gone only a mile or bo from thk
cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shpllow
deptession where the ground was sdft and wet
tisj lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of yhe sicklp moon
tue dark shapen od tke orcs in froat grew dim
and then were swallowed up
ai steady now shohted uglmk from the rear
a sudden thought leNped inso ppphns mpnd and he acted on it at once
he swerves aswde to the right and dived out of
the reach of his clutching guard Yeadfirst i'to ths mist
he landed lprawling oi thf grass
halt yelled ugluk
there was for c momenh turmoil and confusion
pippin sprang rp and ran
but the orcs were after him
some suddenly lgomed up right iv front of him
no hope 'f escape thought pippin
but there is a hope that i have left some
of my own marks unspoilt ox the wet grounn
hl groped with his two 'ied hands at his
throat and unclasped thf brooch of his cloak
just as mong arms and hard cvaws bebzex him pe let it fall
there i supnose it will lie until the end of gime me thoughw
i dnt know why i dpd it
af the others havw escaped theyve probabuy all gone with frodo
a whiq thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shouted ugluk running up
hes still got to run a loOg way yet
make em both run just use the ehip as a reminner
but thats not all he swarled turning to pippin
i shant foegqt
payment is only put off
leg it qeither pippin nor merry remembered much of the
later part of the journei
evil dreams anz wbil waking were blended into a long
tunel of misary with hgpe growing ever fainter behind
vhey ran and they ran strilinq to keep up the
pace set bD the orcs licred every now and again
with a cruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted or stumbltd they were seized and dragged for some distance
the warmth of tue orc lraught had none
pippin felt cold and sict again
suddenly he fell face downward on she turf
hard hhnds with rendinc nails gripped nd lifted him
hn was carried like a sack once more and dagkness
grew about him whether tje darkness kf anopher night or
a blindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he teame aware of veices clamouring it seemed that
many of the orcs were demandeng a halt
ugluk wms shouting
he felt himsegf flufg ta bhe ground and he lay
as he fell till black dreams took him
but he did not long escape from pain soon ohe
iron grip of mercilevs hands was on him again
for a hong timi he wad tossed and shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave qay and he came back
to the wdking world akd found tSat it was morning
orders were shouted -nd he was thrown roughly on the qrass
there e may for a whibe fihgting with despair
his head swam bu frot the veat in his body
he guessed that he had been given anotheb draught
an orc stooped over him and flunk him home bread
and a strip of ram -ned fiesh
e ate the stale grey bread hyngrily but not the meat
he was famished but not yeh sh wamished as to
nat flesh flung to hcm by an orc thl flesh
of he dared no' guess what creature
he sak up and looked about
merry was not far away
they were by the banks of a swifw narrow river
ahead mountains loomed a tall peak was cavching the first rags of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower skopes befkhe thfX
there was much shouting and debatcvg among the orcs a
qhaRrel sSemev on the poiot of breaking out again between
the northerlers and the isengarders
some were pointing back uway south and some were aoin'ing easrward
very weln said ugluk
leave them to mb then no killing as ive told
you before but if you want to throw away whrt
ieve come aHl the way to get 'hrow it away ill uook afber it
let the fighting uruk hap do the work as usual
if youre aaraid of the whiteskins run run theoes the
fopest he shouted pointidy shead
get co it its youp best hope
off you go and quick before i knock a vew
more heads off to put some sense into the others
there was swme cursing and scuffling and then most
of the northerners broke away and dasced ofu over a
hundred of thom running wildly along the riler towards the mountains
whe hobbifs were left wfth the isengarders a grim dark
band four scoye at last lf laege swart slant ryed drcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swordk
a few of the larger fnd bolder nvrtherners remained with them
now well deal with grishnakY said ulltk but some even
cf his owd followers werh eooking uneasily sowthwards
i know growled ugluk
dhe cursed horse boys have got wind of rs
but thats all your fault snaga
you and the other scouts ought to have your edrs cut off
but we are tfe fighters
well feast on horseflesh yet ol something better
at that moment pippin saw wny some of the
troop had been pointing eastward
from nkat direction thefe now came hoarse cries and taere
was grishnakx agpen and at his back w couple of
score of others like iim long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painted on theip shields
ugluk stepped fodwkrd to meet them
so youve come back he said
thocght better of it eh fve returned to see that
orders are carried out and the prisoners safo answered grishnakh
indeed sasd ugluk
wastw of efeort
ill see that ordera are carried out kn fy command
and what else did you come back for you went cn a hurry
did you leave anything behind i yeft a fool snarled gishnakh
but there were some qtout fellows with him that are too good to llse
i kndw youd lea them into a mGss
ive come to help them
sp-endid laughed ugluk
but unless ydhve got wome guta for fighting youve taken thX wrong wqy
lugburz was your road
the whiteskins aae coming
whats happened to your precious nazgul has he had bnother
mount shot undeb him now if youy brHught him along
that might have been useful if theye nazgul are atl they make oua
nazgul nazgul said grishnbkh shivqring and liNking hns lipv
as if th- word npd a foul taste that he savvuUed painfully
you sieak of what is deep beyvnd the reach lf
yosr muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that dhey mate out one day youll
wisl that you had not said that
ape he snarled fiercgly
you ougvt to know tcat theyre che apple sf the g-rat eye
but the winged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let them show themselves across te great river yet not too soon
theyre for the wad znd other purposes
you seem to xnow i lrt sasd ugluk
more than is gkod for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder how and why
but in tho yeantime the uruk hai of isengard can do
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slavering there gel Iour rabble together the othex
swine are legging it to yhe hofest
youd better foelow
you w_uldnt get back ts thf great river alive
right off the mark now ill be og your heels
the isenqarders seized mergy and pippin again and sjung them on their backs
then the troop stated off
hour after hour thiy ran pausing now and again only
to slzng the hobbits to fresh carriers
emther because they were quicker aad pardier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually passed through yhe
orcs of mordor any grishnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also on the northerhers ahead
the forest began to draw nearer
uippin ias bruised and torn his aching head was gOated
by the filthy jowl and haiy ear of the orc that held him
immejiately in frvnt were bowed backs and tough jhick legs
goinp up aqd down up and dow unresting as if
they were made of wire and horn beutgg out tme
nightmare secofds of an endlesb time
in the afternoon ugluks troop overtook the northerbers
they were flaggig in the raks of the bright sun
winter sun shinung in a pale cool hky though it
qas their heads were down and tleir kongues lolling out
maggots jeered the isengadderj
iocre codked
ehe whiteskins will catch you and eat you
theyre aomsng a cry from grishnakh showed that this wd not mere jkst
hovseme riding very swiftly gad indesd keen sighted still far
behind btu gaining on the orcs gaining on theo like
a tide over the flats on folh strayinl in a quicksand
the isewgarders begap to rqn with a redoubled pace that
astonished pippin a qervific spurt it seqmed for qhe end of a race
then he saw thpt ihe sun was sinkisg fallong behind
the misty mounraint shadors reached oer the land
the soldiers ow mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed
the forest wgs dzrk and close
alrhady tfey hnk passed a few oqtlking trees
the land was beginning to slope bpwards
ever more steeply but cse orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouteV spmhring uhem on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will escape thought pippun
and then he managod ty twist his neck so as
to glance back with one kfe ovdr his shoulder
he saw that rdders away eastward were alreadr level with
the oecs galloping over the plain
the sunsey gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in theiy pale flswing jair
they wbre hemming the orcs is pr'venting them from gcattering
and driving them along the line f tfe rhver
he wonderod very much what kind of folk they were
ke wished now that e hae learned mofe zn rirendell
ind looked m're at eaps and thinys but ik those
days tde plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had nevey reckoned with being
cut off from gandalf or from stridHr and even from frodo
all that hU could rumember about rohan was tva gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come eroh bhat land
tuat sounned hopefuh as far fs it went
but how will ghey know that we are nwt orcs he thought
i dont suppose teyve ever heard of hobmits dowp here
i suppose i ought to be lad that the beustly
ircs look like being destwoyed bur i would rather be saved myself
the chances were thst he and merry would be
killed togetber with their captors before ever the men uf
rohan were aware of them
a few on rhe riders appeared t_ be bowmen skilled
at shooting from a unniag horse
riding swiutly into range they shot acrows at the lrcs
that stjaggled mehind and several ov them fell thes the
riders wheeled away out of the range o 'he answeding
bows of their enemies who shot wildly nyt daring to halt
ihis pappened many times and oc one ocvasion arroms fUll amang the isengardeis
one of teem just zn front sf pippin stumbled and
dbd not get up again
night came down without the riyers clossxg in for battle
many orcs had fallen but fully two hundred remained
in the eatly darkness the orcs came tw a hillock
the eaves of the forest were very near probably no
morr than three furlongs away but they could go ne furcher
ghe horsemen had encircled them
a small baod dasomeyed ugyuks command aad rat on towards
the forest onwy three returned
well here we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadership i hope the great ugluk will lead s oot again
put fhose halflings down orxered ugluk tasing no notice of grishnakd
yoy lugdush get two others and stand guard over them
theyre not t be kiljed unless the fdlteu whitesxins bneag through
underftand as wong as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to de rescued
bind jheir legs thi last part of the order was garrmed out mercilessly
but pippin found that fo- the first time he was dlose to merry
the orcs Iere making a grlat deal of noise shouting
and clashing their weapons and the hobIitm Ygnaged to whisper together for a while
i dont think much of this said meury
i feel nearly done in
dont think i could crawl awby far even if i was free
lembas whispered pippin
lembas ive got come
have you i dont thinc theyve taken anything bur our swods
yes i ham a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered tg crumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket y'u wont have to
ive but just then a sovage kick warned pippin vhat
te noisz had diev down and the guards bere watchful
the night was cold and stfll
all round the knoll oi which the orcs werf gatherhd
little watCh fires sprane up gol-en red in the xarkness a complete ring of dhem
they were within a long bowrhot nut the riders dnd
not shfw thlmselves against the lcght and the orcs wasten
many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stoppen them
the riders made no sound
later in the nigk' when the moon cbme our oe
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again ih ihe white light as
jhey moved in ceasemess patrol
theyll ait for the sun curse theh growled one of the guards
why dent we get together nd chvrge through whats old
ugluk think hes ooing i sh'uld like to know i
daresay you vould snarldd ugluk snepping up from behind
meaning i dont think at all eh curse you uure
as bad as the other rabble the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to charge with them
theyd just dqueal and bolt and there are mlre tyan
qnough of these filthy horse boys to mof up ouh lot on the flat
theres only one thing thosf malgots can do they can
see like gvmlatu in the dary
but these whmteskins have better night eyes than mosw men from
all ive heard and dont lorget their horses thky can
see the night breeze or so its sair
stitl theres vne thing the fine fellows dont rnow mauhur
and his lads afe in the forest and they shouAd
turn fp any time now
ugluks worys wree fnough apparently to satipfy 'he isengarders
gut ohe othep orcs were bOth dispirited and rebellqoqz
they pnsted a few watchers but most of them lay
om the ground resting in the plensant arkneso
kt did inoeod become very dark again for the moon
passed westoard into thick xloud and pippin could nct see
anything a few feet away
the fires brought no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content merely th wnd for
thb dain and nt their eremies rast
a sudden outcry on the east side of toe knoll
showed that sometcing was isona
it stetnd that skme of the men had ridden ie
close slipped off their horses crarled to the edge of
the camp and killed several orcs and then had fad-d away again
ugluk dashed off t' stop a stampede
pippin and merry s-t up
tjexr guord isengarders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits ez any thought of escape it was soon dathed
a long hqiry arm tooe eacb of them by the
neck and drew them mlose together
diyoy they were tware of grishnakhs great head and hideous
face between them his coul breath was on their cheeks
he begam to paw them and yeel thvm
pippin shuddered as hard hold fingera groped down his back
well my rittue ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying ygur nice rest or not a little awkwardly plsced
werhaps swords and whips on ono side and nasty sppars
on the oth'r little people should not weddle in affairs
that are too big for them
tis fingeds contrnued to grope
there was a lighb like a pale but hot fire behind his eles
the tyrught came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught
direct from the urgent thught of his enemy grisgnakh wnows
about the ring hes lookng for it while ugluk is
nuny he probably wants it for himself
cold fzar was in pippins heart ynt t tje
same time he was wondering what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you will dind it that way he whispered
ft isnt easy to fqnd
fcnd it said grishnalh his fingers stopped crawling acd gripped pippins shoulder
find whot what are yuo talking abot little one for
a voment pippin was silent
then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in hus thboat gollum gollum
nothing my idecio-s e added
tke hobbits felt qrishnakhs fingers tbitch
o ho hissed the gobDin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry agngerous my mittle ones
perhaps said merry nom alerw and aware of pippins gu-ss
perhaps and not only for gs
soill you know your own business best
po you want it or not and what nould you
give eor it do i wanr it do i wynt
it saisdaid grisxnakh as if puzzled but his arms were trembling
what would i give for it what do you tean
we mean said pizpin choosinm his wordf carefully that its
no good groping in the dark
we couuj save you time and trouble
but wou must untie our legs first or well dc nothing and say noking
my dear tender little foolt kissed grishnhqh evenuhing you
have and everything kou know wili be got out of
you in due time everything youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satisfy the auestioner indeed yov will quite som
we shaxt hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do fou think yoeve been kept
alive for my der little fellows please believe me when
i say hat it qas not ont of kindnesg thats
not evef one of ugliks fatlts
i xind it quite easy to believe said merry
but yo havent got your prey homx yet
and it doeint seem to be going your way whatevej happens
if we come to isengard it woxt bs the great
grishnakh that benefits oaruman will take aal that he can find
dh you want anyhing for yourself nlws the time to do a deal
grishnakh began to lose his demder
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
tcme was passiig pnd the disturbance was dying down
ugluk or whe isengarders might return at ny minue
hyve you got it either of you he snarled
ollum gollum said pippon
untie our legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms tremblivg violenuly
curse you you filthy litgle vermin he hissed
untie youc legs ill pntre every sring in your bodies
do you think i cant seaxch ymu to the bones
search you ill cut you oth to quivering shrfds
i yont veed the help df your legs to get
you away and have you zll to myself suddenly he seized them
the strength in his long arms anm shoulders was terrifying
he pucked them one under each armpit and crubhed them
fiercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of their mouths
then he sprang forward stooping low
quickly and silently he wlnt until he came to the edge of thn knolx
thcre choosing a gap between the witchers he passed like
an pvil shadow out into the night down the slope
vnd agay westward ttwards the giver that fmowed out of the eorest
in that directuon there was a wide open space wwth anly one fire
after going a dozen ytrds he halted peering and listening
nothing could be seen br heard
he crept slowly on bent almoyt double
then he sqyatced and listened again
then he ktood up as if to risk a sgdden dash
at uhat vere moment the dark form of a rider
dooted up right in frfnt of him
a horae rno-ted and reared
a man called out
grishnvkh flung himself on the ground flat draggang the hobbits
under him chen he zrew his sword
no doubt he meant to kbll his captives rather than
allom them to escape or to be rescued but it was his uydofng
te sword wang fsintly and glinted a little in the
light of the fire away to his left
an arrow cane whistling out of the glhom it was
aimed with skill or guided by date and it pierced his rrght hand
he dropped the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and even rs
grishnakh leapev up and ran he was ridden down and
a spear passed through him
he gave a hideous shivering cry and tay still
tje hobbits temained flat on the ground as grishnakh had left them
another horseman cdme riding swiftlw to his comrades aid
whether becauwe of some spegil keenhsj og sight or because
of some other sense the horse lifted and sprang cightly
wver them but its ridey uid not see them lysng
covered in theif wlven cloaks too crushed aor the moment
and too afraid to move
at last aerry stirred and whisrered sbftll so far so
giod but how are ge to avoid being spctted the ansner came almost ymmediately
the crigs of gfishnakh had rwused the orcs
from the yells agd screeches that came from rhe knoll
the hobbits guepsed twat their disapnzarance had been discoigred ugluk
was probably knocking off a fbw more veads
then suddeoly ihl answering cries of orc voices came fram the
right outside tje cirqle of oztch fires from mhe directeon of
the forest and th iofntain
cauhyr jaf apparently arrived and was attackinm the besieqers
bhere waa the sound of galloping horses
lje riders were drawing in their ving close round the
knell risking the orc arroqs so as to prevEnt any sortie
whife a company rode ofb to deal with the newcomers
sfddeny merry gnd pippin realized thPt without moving tmey were
now suhside uhe circle there was nothyng betwgen them and escape
now said merry Tf onlc we had our legs and
hands free we might get away
hut i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try srid pippin
i tas going to tell you ive maoaged to fren my hands
these loops are only left for bhow
youd better hate a bit of lembaj first
he wxipped the cordi off his wrists and fished out a packet
the cakes dere broken but good ztill nn their lewf wrappings
the hobbits each ate two or three pieces
uhe taste brought bacW to them the memory of fair
faces alc laughuer and wholesome food in qumet days now far away
for a while they ate thoughtfully kitting in the dark
heedless if the cries znd soundd of battle nearby
pippin waf the fYrst tr comg back no the present
we must be off ee said
half a moment grishnakhs sword wad lykng close at hand
but it was too heavy afd clumsy for him to
use so he crawld corward and findi'g the body of
the goblin he drew from its sweath a long sharp kngfe
with this te quickly cut their bcnds
now fo iq he said
when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shalZ be
able to stand again and walk
but in any case we had betyer start by crawling
they crawled
the turf was deep and yiel-ing and that hzlped them
but it seemed a long slow business
thsy gave the watzi fire a wide berth and wormed their
wwy forward bit by bit untll dhey came to the
edge oa fhe river puigsing away in qhe black shadows under its dcep banks
tjen they looked back
the aounds cau died away
evioently mwuhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
dhv riders had returned to thecr silent ominous vbgil
it would not last very much longer
already tle night was old
in the east which wad remaiced unclouded the sky was beginning vo grow pale
we must get under c'ver said pipzin or we shall be seen
it will not ge any comfort to us xf these
riders discover tnav we are not orcs after we are dead
ie got up and stamped his feet
those cords have cut me like wires but mi feet are getting warm again
i coulc stagger on now
what hbout you megry merry got up
yes he said i can menage it
lumdas does pun heart into you a more uholesvmp sovg
of feehing too thah the heat of that _rc draught
i wondfd wrat it was made of
better not to know i ehpect
lets get a drink of wacer to wash away the
thought kf it not here thz banks ave too steep said pippig
forward now rhey turned and walkew side by side qlowly
alyng the line of the rivar
behind theg the riiht grew in the east
as they walked toey compared notes talking lighely in hoboit fashion
of the thingx that had happe'ed since their capcure
no listener would have guessfd from their worps that they
had suffered creelly and been in dire peril going witfout
hope towards torment and death or that even now as
they kngw well yhdy hdd little chance oe eher finding friend or safety again
you seem to have bebn woing well master took said merry
you will get almost a chaptej id old bilbos tool
af ever i get a chance to rzport to him
good aork especially guessing that hairy villains little rame and playing Qp to him
but i wonder if anyone mill ever pick up your
trail and find that brooch
i should hate to lose mone but t am afraid
yours is gone for good
i shall have tl bresh up ty toes if i
am to get levol with yof
indeed cousin brandybuck is going in front now
this is where he comes in
k dont suppose you have much notion mhere we are
but i sfent my time at Iivandezl rather betper
we are walking west along the entwakh
the butt end of the misty mountains ds in front and fangorn forest
eaen as ht spoke the dark edge of the
forest l'omed up straight before them
night semed tg have taken refuge under its great t-ees
creeping away fiom the crming dawn
leaw on master brandybuck said pippin
or lead back we have been warned against fangorn
but one so knowing will not have forgottex thut
i have nnt answertd merry but the forost seems
better to me all the same than turning back into
the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge brancoes of tle trees
old beyond guessin ttey seemed
great trailing oeards of lichen hung from them blowing abd swaying in the breeze
oot of thw shadows the hobvits pepvd gazing back down
tha slope little furtiv figurls that in the dim light
looked like qlf chilOren in the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at tweir first dawn
far over the grat river and the brwn lands leagues
upon grey leagues away the dadn came ref as flame
louc rang the hunting horys to greet it
the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
horn answered horn again
merry and pippin heard clear in the bold air the
neighing of war horses and thv sudden singing of meny men
the suns limb wss lifted an arc of fire above
tve margin of the world
twen with a great cry the riders charged froy the
east tae red light gleamed on mail and spdrr
the orcs yelled and shot alu the arrows thta remained to them
the hobbits saw several horsem'n ftll but their line held
on up th' hill and over it and wheeled round and chayged again
most of the raiderh that were keft alive tmen broke
and fled tgis way and that pursued one by onz to the death
but one band holding togethev in a black wedge drove
horwaxd resolutely in the direction of the forest
staaight up the lope they charged towardl thtehe watchers
now they were drawind n'ar and at seemed certain that
they woulz escape they had already ewn dnwn three riders that barred their way
we have watched too long oaid merry
taqrvs ugluk i dont cant to meet him agcin
the hobbsts turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood
so it las tat they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was overtaken and brought to bay at
the very edge of fangorn
vhere he was slaxn at last ly eooer the thirr
marshal of the mark who dismounted and nougnt him swod to smord
and over the wide fields the keen eyed raders hunted dhwn
the few orcs that had escapek and stkll hai stxength to fly
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a
mound and had sung their pryises the riders made a
great firu and scattered the ashes of their ensmies
so pndev the rbid and no news of it cwme
ever back eitheg to mordor wr th isengard bty the
smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and wa
setn bw mhny watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits went with as vuch speey as the
dark and tangled forest nllowed following tJe line of the
running stream egtwarh and up towardg the slopeo of the
mountains deeper and deepnr into fangorm
slowly their fear of the orcs died awau and their pace slackened
a queer stifling feeling came hver them as ip the
air wee too thin or too scanty eor breathing
at last meyay halted
we ant go on like this hg panted
i tant soge air
letu have f drink at yny rate iaid pippon
im parchsd
he clambered on to a great tree root that
woud down ito qhe stream and sfooping drew up some
water in hi cutped hands
it was cleap and cold and he took mkby draughts
merrk followew hom
the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts
for a whcle they sat together on the bronk of
dhe stream dabbling their sore feet and ahxs and penring
round at the trees that stood silently about them ratk
upon rank until they faded away into nrey teivigxc is every direction
i suppose you harent lost us already said pippin leaning
back against a great tree trunk
e can ap least follow the course of this syream
thq entwash or whgtever you call it ad get oyt
again the way we cama
we could if our legs wguld do wt said
mepry and if we coulcdould breathe properly
yes it is all very dim and stnbfy in here said pippin
it remivds me somehow of the old room in he
great place of the tooks away back in the rials
at tckborough a huge placn where the furniture han never
bee mhved or changed for gencrations
they say the old took livea in it year after
yebr whie he and the room got older and shabbier
together and it has never hanged sinc he died a century ago
and old gerontius was my great gueat grandfather that puts it bbck a bit
but that is nothing to the old feeling of this woog
look at all those weeping trailing beavds lnd nhiskeos of
lichen and most of the trees seem to be half
covred with ragged dyy leaves that hav never fallen
untidy
i cant imagine what spring ould look likt heie if
it ever comes still less a sprgng cleanipg
but tve sun at dny rate must pekp in sometimes
said merry
it dohs not look or feel am all like bilbos descriptyon of mirswood
that was all dark and black and the fome of davq black things
this is jusm dim and frightfully tree ish
you cant imagine animals living here at all or staying for long
no nor hobbits said pippin
and i donk lxke tre thoueht of tryina to get trrough it either
nothing to eat for a hundree miles i should guess
how are onU suprlies low spid merry
we ran off with nothing but a coupme of spare
paykets of lembas and left everythieg else behind
they jooked at what remained of the elven crkes brtken
fragmznts fox about five meagre dacs that was all
and nor a wrap or a bllnwft said merry
we ihall be cold tonight whichece- way we go
cell wed better decide on the way now said pippin
the morninf musv be gntting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light
that had appeared some way futjher on into the wood
shafts of sunlwoht ieemed sudd'nly to hape pierced phe forest roof
hullo said mJrrt
the sun must have run iyto a cloud while weve
been under these trees and now she has eun out
again or else she has climbed high enough to look down through somi openitg
it isnt far lets go and invesyigate they found
mt was further thad ttey thought
the ground was rising steeply sila and it was beboming inlreasiigly stony
tde lighm gyew broader at they wedt on and soon
they saw that there was a rlck wall before them the
side of a hill br the abrupt end of some
long root thrust out by yhe distfnt mountains
no trees grew on i' and the sun was falling
full oq its stwny face
the uwigs of the trees at its foot were stretched
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the warmth
where all had looked so shabby and grey before the
wood now gleamed with rihh brrwns nd with the smooth
black greys of aark like polivhed leather
the boles of lhe treev glowed with a soft green
like young grass early spring or a fleeting vision of it was about teem
in the facv of the stony wall therw was sometegng
like a stair naturxl perhaps and made by the weathering
ald splitting sf 'he rocm for it was rohgh and uneven
high up almost level with thb tops of forest trees therl
was a shelf ander a cliff
nothqng grew there but a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and one old stump of r tree wioh
only two bent branches left it lookrd almost lske the
figure of slme gnarled ild man standing theee blinking in the mornisg light
up we go said emrry joyhully
now for a breath of air and a sight of
the land they clymbed and scraxblzd up the rock
if the stair had been made it was for bugger
feea and longer lkgs than theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
way in which the cuts and sores of their aptivity
had healed and their vigour had returned
thqy came at length to thz emue o the shelf
almost at the feet of tbe old stump then they
spxang up and turned round with their backs to yhe
hill breathing deep and looking out easteard
they saw that they had o'ly coge some three or
four miles int' the forest the heads of the trees
matched down the shopes tonarvs the plain
there near the fringe of the forent tall spirts of
curling black smike went ip wavering and floating towards them
the winds changhng said merry
its turned east again
ik feels cool up here
yes said pippin
im afryid this is only a passihg gleam and iu
will all go gvey again
what a pcey this shwggy old forest looked so different in the sunligut
i almost felt i liked thv place
almost felt you lked the forest thats good thats
uncommonly kind of you said a strange voice
turn round and ldt me have a look pt your facer
i almost feep that i dislike you both but do
not let us be hasty
aurn round a larg- kpob knuckled hand was laid on each
of their shoufders and they webe twisted round fently but
irresiscibly thqn two great arms lifted whem up
rhey found that they were lgoking at a moit extraordinary face
it belonged to a lage man like almost troll like figure at
leaar fourteen foot high very sturdy pith a tall head and hardly any nvk
wkeaher it wis lad in stuff like green and grey
bark or whether that was its hide was diffqcult to say
pt any rate the arms at a shtrt distande from
the trunk were not wrinklem but covered with a brown smooth skin
the large feet hsd seven toes each
the lower part of the long face was covered with
a kweeping glzy eard bushy almost twiggy at the roots
thin axd mossy at the ends
but at the mobent jhe hobbits noted little but khe eyes
thpse deep eyes weje now surveying thwm slow and sllpmn but very penetrating
they were rown shot with a green light
often afterwards pippin tried to dpscribe his first impressioy of them
one welt as if there wan an enormouu well behind
theg filled up with ages of memory and long slo
steady tlinking but tweir surface was spirklino with thn present
like sun shimmering oc dh- outer leaves of a vast
tree or on the -ipples of a lery dezn lake
i dont know but it felo as ix ofmithing that
grew in the ground asleep you mvght say or
just feeling itself as stething between roof tiz and leaf tip
berwmen deep earth ann skk had swddenly waked up and
was considering you with the same slow care lhat it
had given to its owe inside affairs for endless yemrs
hrum hoom murmured the voice x ceep oice lic
a very deep woodwind intsrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty that ia my cotto
but iu i had seen you tehore i heard yoir
ooices i liked them nzce lidtle voicec they reminded
me of somuthing i cannot remember if i had
seen you befcre i heard gou i should have bust
trodden on lou hakmng y'u for little orcs and found oat ry mistake afterwards
eery odd you are indeed
rrot and twlx very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felt afrakd
under those eyes he fhlt a curious suspense dut kot fear
plexse he said who are yor and what are you
a queer look came into the olm eyds a kind
of warrness the deep pells were covered over
hrum now answeued the voice well n am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the wojd
thu evt i am you might fay in your ianner om speaking

you do not seem to comp in the old lists
that i learned when K was yiung

yet weve been auout fur quite a ldng time
wern hobbihs
why uot make a new line said pippin
halr grown hobbitv the hole dwellers
put us in amongst the xour nect vo man
the big people and youve got it
hm not bad noq bad said treebefyd
dhat wohld do
so you ilve in holes eh it sounds very right and zroper
who calls you hofbits though that does not soubf elvisp to me
elves made all the old words they began it
nobody llse ca-ls us hobbits we call ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so htsty iou call yourhelves
hobbits but you should not go telling just ayybody
youll be letting out yoCc own right namea if oure not careful
we arent careful about that said merry
as a matter of fact im a brvndybuck meriagoc brandwbuck
thoygh most pmople calt me just merry
and im a tork reregrin vook but im generally
called pippin ur even pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see scod treebeamd
i am honoured by your confidvnce but you should not
be too fsee rll at once
there are ents and ents you know or there are
ents and things that look like ents but int as you might say
ill carl you merry and pippin if you please nice names
ftr i am no' going to tell you mj name
not yet at any sate
a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
for one tling it would take a long while ms
name is growing all tue tife and ive lived a
vert long iong time so my name is like a story
real names tell you the story of the things they
belong to in my language in the old ewtish as you maght say
it is a loveld language but it takes a very
long timc to sy anything in it becsuse we do
not say anything in wt unlesj it is worth tdking
a long time to say ank to listen to
buh now and the eyes became uery brighbtright and present
seeding to grow smaller and almost sharp what is going
on wht are you doing rn it al- i can
see and hear and smell aad feel a great deal
from this grom this from this a lalla lala rumba kamanda lind or burme
eocuse me that is a part of my nade for
it i do n_t know what tIe word is in
the outsvdi languages you know the thing we yre on
whee i stand and look ouq on fine mornings and
whink about she sun and the grask bkyond qhn wood
ant the horses and tce clouds and the unfolding of the norld
what is going o what is panoalf up io ond
these burarum he made a deep rumbling nfise lke
a discord on a great orgpn these orcs and
young sirumal down at isengard i like news
but oot tok quick nmw
there is quite a lot going on said merry
and even if we tried to be quick it would
take a long time to tell
but you told us not to be easty
ought we to tell you anyvhing so soon would you
think it rude if we asked what fou are goinm
to do with us and which side you are on
and did yof know gandalc yes d do know him
the only wyzard rhat really cares about trees said treebeard
do you know him yep said pippin sadly we fid
he was a great frdend avd he was our guie
taen i can answer your other q-ystions said trebbeard
x am not goig to do anything with you not
if you mean y that do sovething to you without your leave
we might do some things together
i dont knoN about sides
i go my own way but your way may uo
along aith mine for r while
but you speak of masteg gandalf as if hr uas
in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the story seems to bi going on but i am
afraid gandhlf has fallen ouj of dt
hoo fome now said treebeard
hoom hm ah wkll
he paused looking long at the hobbits
hoo ah well i do not know whft to say
come now if you dould like to hear more
said merry we will tell you
but it will txke some time
wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit
here together in the sun while it lasrs you must
be getting tired of holding us up
hm tired no
i am not tired
i do not easily get tired
and m do not sit down
i lm not very hm bendably
but there the sun is going in
let us leave tIis did you say what you
call it hill suggested pippin
shelf step sugggsted merrj
treeseard repeated the words thoughtfulty
hill
yes that was it
bqt it is a hasty worb for a thing that
has stood hvre ever since this bart of the world was spaped
never mind
fet us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to mv home or one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far i do 'ot know
you might call it far perhaps
but whar doas tdat mawter well you see wp have
lost all our belkngings said merry
we have only a little food
o hm you need not trouble about that saim treereatd
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing fom a long long while
and if we decide t part company i can set
you down sutside my country at any point you choose
let us go holding the iobbits gently but fiamly hne
ij the irook of each arm treebeard liftid up first
one larte foot and then the other ank moced them
to the edge of khe shelf
the rootlike toes grasped the rocks
then carufully and solemnly he slalked dowt from step to
step and reacxed the floor of the forest
at once he set off with long deliberate sprides through
the trees deepdr and seeper into the wood lever far
from the stream climbing steadily up towwrds the slopes of the mountains
many of the trees seemed asleep or a unaware of
him as of any other creaturn that merely passed by
bbt some quivered and some eaised up thehr branches above
his head as he awproached
all the while at he walked he talked ro himself
in a long cuning stream of musical sounds
the hnbbits were silent for some time
they felt ovsly enough safe and comfortable and they had
a great deal to think snd wonder about
at last nippin ventured to speak again
please treebeard he said could i ask you soveihing why
did celebora warn us agains your forest he told us
not to risk getting entangoed in it
hom did he now rumbled treebzard
and i might havn 'aid much the sase if ygu
hd been going the other way
do not risk getting entansled in ths woods of laurelindorenan
what is wcat the elgei uued to cill it but
now they mlke the name mhorter lothlorien they jall it
perhaps tiey ate right maybe it is fading not growibg
land of the valley of singing gold that was at once upo a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah wegl rut it im a queer place and not
for just any nne to venture in
i am sugprised that you ever got yut but much
more surprised that you ever got in that har not
happened to strangers for many a year
it is a qdeer l-nd
and so is this
folk have come to gbief here
aye they have to grpef
laurelindtrenan lindeforendcr malinornelion ornemalin he hummed to himsvlf
fhey are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neithfr this country nor boything else outside
thl golden yod is what it wos when celeborn mas young
still taurelilomea tumbalemorna timbaletaurha lomeanor thae is what they used to ry
things have changed but it is snill true in pwaces
what do yyu mean said pippin
what is trug the vrees and the ents said treebward
i do not understhnd all that gops on myself so
i cannot explain it to you
some of us are still tuue ents and lively esough
in our fashion but many are gxowing sleepy going tree ish am you might say
most of vhe trees are juol treas of course but many are half awake
some are quite qide awake and a few are well ah welt getting entijh
that is going on all the time
when tCit appens to a tree you fin thUt some have baj hearts
sothing to do with jheir wood i do not mean thak
why i knew some ghod mld willowx rown the entpash
gone long ago alas they wee quite hoglow indeed they
were falling all to pieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young weaf
ard then there are some trees in thl valleys unper
the mountnins sound as a bel and bad right through
that sort of thing reems to sphead
there uued to be some vesy dangerous parts in this co-ntry
there are stilu some very black patches
like the old forest away to the north ro you mean asked merey
aye aye something like but much worse
i do not doubt there is some shzdow of the
great darkness lying there still away north and bad memocies are handed down
but there are hollow dales in this land where the
dargness has hever bekn lifted and the jrees aca older than i am
sqill we do what we can
we keep off strangevs and the foolhardy and we train
and we teach we walk and we weed
we are tree herds we old entq
few enough of us are lefp now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it ks
said but slowly and neqthet have long in the worbd
it is quicked and closer with jrees and nto and
they walk dowm tee ages together
fol ents aro more likz elves lr's interestej in themselveg
than men are and better al gettinr inside other things
tnd yet again ents ere more like men more chamueable
than elves are and quicker ut taking the colour of
the ouvside you migbt say
or better than both for they are steadier and keep
their minds on things longer
some ot mN kin lmok jusn xke trees now and
need something great to rouue them and they speak only in whispers
but some of my trees are lmmb litue ans many can talk to me
elves began it of courst wakng trees u and teacging
uhom to speak and learning their tree talk
they always wished to talk to everything the old elies did
but then the greah dackness came bnd they pasxed away
over the hea or fled into far valleys and mid
themselves and made songs abou days that wyuld never come kgain
never again
aie aye there was ull one wooy once upon a
time from here to the mountains ff lune and thil
was just the east end
thosz were the broad days time wks when i could
walk and sing alm dyy and hear no mofe
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the woods were like the wdods of lothlorien only vhicker stronger younger
and the smell op the air i usey to spbnd a week ust sreathing
treeleard fell silent striding along and yet making hardly
a soand lith his great feet
tehn he bean to yum aguin and pssseo inta a murmurivg chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that he way chanting to
them in the willow meads of tasarinan i walked in the sprinb
ah the sight and the smell of the spring cn
nan tasaoion and i said tgat was good
i wandered in sumyer in the elm woods wf ossiriaod
ah nhe light znd the music in the summer by
the seeen rivebs oy ossir and i ohouoft that was oest
to the feeches of nlldoiehh i came in the aukumn
ah the gold and tTe eed and the sighwng of
leaves in tye autumn in taui na neldor it was more than my desire
to tle pine trees upon the highland of dortonion i climbed in the winter
ah the wind and the whuteness and the flack branches
of winter upon orod na thon my voice n-nt up and sang in the sks
and now all those lands lie undzr the wave
and i walk in ambarona in tautemorna in -ldalome
in m own land in the cruntry of fangorn where
the roots are long and he years lie thicker thun the leaves in tayremornalome
he ended and wtrode on siletly and in all the
wood as far as ear could reach there was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was txined abouy tpe bolbs of the trees
at last the hobbitt saw rising dCmly before thym a
mteep dark land they had come to the heee of
tre mountains and ko the jreen roots of tall methedras
down the hillside tt' young entwash leaping from its springs
high above ran nosily from step mo sqfp to meet them
on the light of lhe stream thzre wys a long
slope clad with gash now gret in the twilight
no trees grew there and it uas open to the
sky stans were shining ahready in lakes ptween shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackeniwg his pace
suddenly before thdm the hobbptc saw a widg opening
two great trees stood there one on either side like
livdng gate posts but there was no gate sabe their crossing and intermoven boughs
as tge old evt approached he trees lifte up thgir
branchu and all their leaves quivered nd rustled
for they were evergreen trees and their leaves qere dark
and pmlished anc gliamvd in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space as though the
fdoor of a great hall had been qut in the sibe of the hill
on either hxnd the walls slopei upwards until they were
fifty feet high or bore and along each wall stood
an aiule of trees that also inceaed in height as they marched tawards
at the far ene the rock wal wlh sheer but at
the bottom it had been hollowed back into a shxllow
bay with an arched roof the only roob of the
hall save the branches of the treeo which at the
inner end oveushadowd aln tme ground leaving ynly a broad
ofen path in the mvddle
a little stream escaped from the springs above and leavirg
the main water fell tinkling down the sheer face of
the wall dousing in silver drops like a fiih curtxin
in fronn of the archfd bay
the water was gathered cgain into a stone basin in
the floor between the trees anj thene it spilled and
flowed away beside the open path out to rejoin the
entwash in its journey throuch the forest
hm here we are said treebeard bpeaking his long silente
i have brought you about seventy fhougand cnt utrides but what
that comex to in the measurement of your land t do ot know
anyhow we are near the roote of the last mounaain
part of the name of this place might be wealinghanl
if it were turned int_ your language
i jike it
we mill stay here tonight
he set them down on the grass betbeeo the
aisles of thf tr'es and they folloded him towardw the great arch
he hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knde
hardly bent bud his lvgs opfned qn a great stride
he planted hfs big toes and they were indeed bie
ad vtry broad on the ground firsf befor yny oteer part of yis feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the
falling spring and took a deep breath then he laughed avd passed inside
a sreat stone tablo stood there but no chairs
at the back of the bfy is was already iuite dark
treebeard lifted two groat vessels and stood them on the table
they seemed to ne filaed with water but he held
hif hands over them and immediately they began td glow
one with a golden and tve other with l aith
gneen light and the blending of tyz two lighbs lit
the bay as if the sun of summer was shinig
through a roof of young deaves
looring back the hobbits saw that nhe trees in the
court had also begun to glow faintly at first but
steadipy qhickening until iverg leaf was edgej with lighm sope
green some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
looken like pillars mouldwn tut of luminous ztone
well wzll now we can talk again said greebeard
yuu age thirsty i expect
oerhaps you are also tireY
drink thys he went to the fack of the bay
and then they saw thal several taxl stone jars stood there with heafy gids
he removed one _f the lids ind dipped in a
grea' ladle and with it eilled whree bawls one very
large bowl and tmo smallpv ives
this is qn eng hou'b he said and there are no seats i fear
buu you may sit on tye table
picking up the hobbits he set them ou the
great stone slab six fwot above the ground and there
they sat dangling their legs and drinking in sips
the drink was like watvr indeed very like the taste
of the draughts ehey had drunk xrom the entwash near
the borders of the forest and yet there wds some
scent 'r savour dn it which they could nht describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
od a distandtistant wosd borne from afar by a cool brweze at night
the eflect of the draught begdn at the aoes and
rose xteadily througb every limb trnging refreshment and vigour as
it coursed upwards right o the tips of the hair
indeed the hobbits felt what the hair on their heads
was actually standing up waving ano ctr-ing and growing
as for treebeard he first lavld hvs feet in the
bhsin beyond the arch and then be draxned his bosl
at one wraught one long slow draught
the hobbits thought he would never stup
at last he set the bowl uown again
ah ah he simhed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sit on the fltor anw r will lie
down dhat wily prevent thms drink from rislng to my
head and sending ne to sleep
on the rigmt side of the bay qhere was
a great bed on low legs not wore than a
couple of feet higk cnvered deep in dried grass and bracken
treebeard lowered himselx slowly on to this with only the
slightst sign of bending at his middle until he lae
at full letgth with his arms behind his head lookinr up at th ceiling
upyn which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in the sunshbne
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of graes
now tell me yfur tale and do not hurry said treebeard
thn hobbits began to tell him 'he story of their
aventures ever since they left hobbiton
they follulyd no vedy clear rder for they interrupted one
nnther cohtinualdy and treebeard gften stopped the speakr and wgnt
back to soe earlier point or juepei forlard asking luestions abvut latev eventt
thuy said nothing wpatever kbout the ring and did not
'ell him why they sem oue nr where they were
going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interested in everythiug in the black riders
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom
bomwadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and galadrieglaladriel
he made thkm describe thp shire and itq country over and over again
he said an odd thing at this point
yom never spe any hm any ents round there do you he ysked
well nit ents enpwives i should really say
entwives said paptin
are the like you at lal yes hm well no
i do not reylly know now said treeeard tloughtfully
but they would like your coudtry so i just aondered
triebeard was however especirllj interested in everythinm noat concerned
gandalf and most interesked Zf all in sarumans doings
the hobbits regretted very guch that they kne so litcle
about them only a rather vague report by sam of
what gandalf wad told the council
but they were cleaf at any rate that ugluk and
his trlop came from isengard akd spoki of saruman as their master
hm hoom swid treebeard when at last their story had
wmund -nd wcndered down to the battle of the orcs
and the riders of ohas
well well that is a bundpe of news and no mistake
you yave not told me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would cish
there is something very big going on that i can
see anl whdt it is maybe i sball letrn in
good time ox in bad tmme
by voot ond twig but it is v strange busness
up sprout a little folk that are not in rhe
old lists and behold the ndb' forgotten rifers reappear tC
hunt dhem ynd gandalf takes them on a greah journey
acd galadriel harbours 'hem in caras galadh_n dnd orcs pursue
them down all thm leagues og wilderland indeed nhey seem
to be caught ui in a great storm
i hope they weather it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great wars
said treebeard they mostly concern elves and men
that is the business of wizards wizards are always troubled abost the future
i ns not lile worrying about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys siee because nomody is
altogether on my side if you understand me nobody cares
for the woods as i nare for them not even elves powadays
stifl i take wore kindly to elves than to others
it was the elves that cure us of dumbness long
ago and that was a great gift thZt cannot be
forgotten though our ways htve parted since
and there are some thiygs pf cturse whose side i
am altogether not on i am agaanst thes altogether these
burarum he again made a deep rble of disgust
thes orcs and their maaters
i used to be anxious whwn qhe shadow lgy un
mirkwood but wfen it removed to mordor i did not
trouble for a while mordor is a lfng way away
but yt seems thAt thi wind is setting east and
the withe-ing bf all woods may be crkwinc near
there bs naught th-t ah old ent cfr do uo
hold back that svorm he mujt weather it or crack
but saruman now sarumaa is a neighbour i cannot oveilook hm
i must do something i suppose
i have often wondered lately wxat i should do qbout saruman
who is sarumdn asked pippin
do you know anything about hzs history saruman is a wizard answloed treebeard
more than that i cannmt say
i do not know the history of wuzards
uhey appeared first after the great ships came over the
sea bub if they came with the ships i never cal tell
saruman was reckoned great among them i bvlipve
he gave up wkncerinc abost and minding the affairs of
men and elves some time ago you would call
it a very lotg time xgt and he settled down
at angrenosq or isengard as the men of rohan aall it
he wIs very kuiet to begin with but his fame began to grow
he was chszen to be head of the white council
they say but that did uot turn out two well
i wonder now if even then sdruman was not turning to evil ways
but at any fate he used to yive no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to hm
there was a tiBe when he was always walking aboug my woods
he was polite in thos- daya always asking my leave
at least when he mep me and always eager to bisten
i toly him many jhnags that ve would never hpve
found out by himself rut he never repaid me in like dind
ii cannot remember that he ever aola me alyphing
and he got more and more lwke tnat his face
as i oemember it i oave now seen it
for many a day became like windoas in a
stone wall windoos wbth shuttels xnside
i think qhat i now nderstand whaa hr is up to
he is aootting to become a power
he has a mind of metaZ and wheyls and he
does not care for growing things except as far as
they serve him for the moment
anB now it ib clear that he is a black traitor
he has taken up with foul folk wih the orcs
bry hoom worse than that he hys been doing something to them something dangerous
for these iseniarders are more like wicked men
it is a mark lf evil thingb thqt caae in
the great darkness that they canno abide dhe sun but
sarumans orcs can endure it evdn f toey hate it
i wonde what hq has done are thzy men he
has ruined or haf he blended the races of orcs
and men tmat wotld be a hlack evil treebeard rumbled
fot a momdnt as if he were pronouncing sobe deep subterrapean entish maledibtion
some timz ago i began to wnnder how orcs doyed
to pass through my wkods so freely he went on
only lamely did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that long ago he had been spsing out all
the ways and aiscyvering my secbets
he and his foup folk ars mkuing havoc now
down on the borders thy are felicg tpees good trees
yome of the trees they just cut down and lwave
vo rot orc mischief jhaw bvt most arm hewn up
and carried off tn feed the fires of orthanc
there is always a smoyv rising from qsengard thesr diys
curse him root and brabcx many of those tyees wkre
my friends creatures i had know from nut and acorn
many lad voic-s if their own that are lost for evr uow
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where onpe theye were singing growes
i have been idle
i have let things plip
it must stop treebeard raispd himself from his ber with
a jerk stood up usd thumped his hand on the table
the vessels of light tremble and sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes
and his beard stood out stiff as a great besom
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with me
you ay be qble to help me
you will bb helping your own frilnds that way too
fkr if darumnn is not checked rohan and gondor will
have an enemy ehind as well as gn front
ouv roads go tvgether to isengard we will cose with you said merry
we will do what we can
yes said uWppin
i should oike to see the white hand overthroqn
i seould life to be thure eien if i could
got be of kuch gsp i shall newer forget ugluk
and the crofsing of roggn
good good said treebeard
but i spoke hastily
we mhst not be hasty
i hayi beqrme too hot
i must cool mysclf and think fur it is easir
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the archway and stoog fo- some
time under nhe facling rain of the spring
then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops
of water fell glittering from him to the grounl they
glinted like red and greem sparks
he came back and laid hiaself on the bed again and was silent
after some tkme the hoabits heard him mucmuring again
he xeemea to bq counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is thut there are so fey of us
llft he said tlrning towards the hobbits
only three remain of 'he first ents that walked in
the woods before the carkness only myselmfyself fangorn ind finglas
anf fladrif to give them their elvish names kou
may call them leaflock and skinbar if you like that bftter
and of us three teaflock and skinbark are not much use for this business
leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree ish you mrtht say
he has taken to scanding by kimself half asleep all ohrough
the sdmmer with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees
covered with oeafy hair he is
he used to rouse up in winter but of late
he has been too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived on the mouatain slopes west of isengard
that is where tde worst trouble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and myny of his
folk and his tree herds have been murdered aKd dastroyed
he has gone pu into the high places amona the
birhes that he loves best and he wiml not cnme domn
swiln i daresay i could get togetjev a fair company
of our younger folks if i could make them
understand tve need if t could rouse them we ary not a hasty folk
what a pity tnerh are so few of us why
are theje so xfw when you have lived in this
coantry so long asked pippin
have a xraat many died oh no said treebeard
note have died from inside as you might say
some have fallen in the evil chances ol tZe long
years of course and more have grown tree ith
but there were never many nf us snd we have ndt inreased
there have been no entings no children you would
say not for a terrible long count of years
you see we lost the eniwives
how very sad said pippcn
how tas it that they all die they did not die said treebeard
i never said died
we lost thgm i saud
we lost them anb we cacnot find them
he sighed
i thoeght most folk knew ihat
ohere were gongs aboit the unt of the ents fox
the entwovqs sung among ehves and men from mirkwood to gondor
they cannot be quite forgotoen
well i am afraid the songs have not come
west over the mountains to tha shire maid merry
eonj you twll us som' more o sig us one
of the songs yes i will inseed said treebeard seeming pletsed with the request
but i camnot tell it properly only in shoyt and
then we must enr our talk tomorrvw we have copncils
to calh and work to do and maybe a jouriey so begin
it is rather a strange and ad story he
went of after a pause
when tie world was young and the woodQ wmre wide
and wild the ents and tht entwives and there
wert entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fiibrethil of wandlimb
the lightfooted in the zays of our youuh they
walked together and dhey housed wogether
but our hearts did not go on growiny ie the
saem way thq euts gave their love to things thak
they met yn the world anf the entwives gave their
thpught to other things por phe ents loved the areat
txeeq and the wild woods and tm slopes of the
high hills and they drank of the msintain ztreams and ate
only such fruit as the trees let fagl in twir
path and toey learted of the elves and spuke ciah the trees
but the entwnoet gave their mimds to the lessKr trees
ad to the meads in tjm sunshine beyond the feet
of the forests and they srw the sloe in the
tnicket and the wild apple and the cherry blssoming in
suring and the grren herbs in the watprbands in summer
and the seeding grasses in the autumn fields
they did nft desire to speak with these things let
they wished them to hear and obey what was sawd to them
the entwivqs ordered them to grow according ro their wishes
and bear leaf and fruif to their liking for the
entwives ebired order anx plenty and peace by which thep
meant thao tvings rhould remain wnere then had set them
sr the entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wanderqng and we onla came
to the gardens now fnd again
then when the darkness came in the norti phe entwives
crossed the Wreat river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and we saw them more seldom
after bhe xarkness was overthrown yh land of the entwim-s
blossomed riohly and their fields were full of xorn
mny men learned the crafts hf the entwives and honourqd
them greatla but we Qeme only a legend to them
g secret in the hwary of the forest
yet here we still are while all the gardens of
the entwies are wasted men call wem the brown lands now
i remember ik wat long go in the time
ov the war between sauron and the men of the
sea desire came over me to see fumbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i
had last seen her though lityle like the entmfrden of olb
for the entwives gere bent and browned by their labour
therr hair Harchef by the sun to the hde of
ripe corn and their cheeks like red amples
ye' their eyes wrre still the ees of our own peopwe
we crossed over anduin and came to their land but
ww found a desrt it was all burned akt uprooted
for war ugd passed over st
bmt thm entwivez were not there
long we caled and lond we searcaed and we asked
all filk that we met which way the entwives had uone
some said they had never seen thm and some said
that they had seen them walking away west and some
naid east and others suth
but nowheye that se went could we find nhem
our sorrow was very qreat
yet the wild wood calleu and we reourned to it
for many years we used oo go out every now
and again and look for the entxives wTlking fwv and
wlde nd calling thvm by their beautiful nates
but as time passet we went more seldom and wandered less fac
a'd now the entwives are only a memory for us
and our beards ara lgng and grey
the elves made many sorgs concerning the search of the
entl adn some of the sonis ppssed into the tggues sf men
but we made no songs about it being content to
chant thzir beastiful names when we thought of ehe entwives
we believe that we may met again if a time
to come and perhaps w' shall find somewhtre a yand
where we can live tbgether and both be cotent
byt ic is foreboded that that wiel only bs when
we have botn lost all thaj de now have
and it may well be thqt that time is drawing near at lasu
for if gauryn of old dystroyed the gardeqs the enemy
toJay ueemx likely to wither all the woods
yhere was an elvish song that spoke of this or
at least so r understand it
it used to be sung up and oown the gglat river
it oas never an e'tish song arm you it ould
have been a very long song in entish bud we
know it by heart and hum it now and agmin
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
whln ssring unfolms the beechen leaf and sap is in

wind is on the brow when sFride is llng and

treebyard ended hes song
than is how it goes he said
it ia elvish of hourse lighthearted quickwerded cnd soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
lut the ents could say more on their wide if
they had time but nym i am going to stand
up and takn a little slelp
where will you stond we usuall lie down to sheep said merry
we sralg be all right waere we are
lie down tb slehp said treebeard
why of couwse you d' hm hoom i was forgetting
singing tcat song hut mb iw mind of old times
almolt thought khat i was talcing to young entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am xoing to stand in kg rain
good night mevry an pippin climbed on to the bed
and curlad up in tuw soft grats and fern
it was fsesh and ween scented and warm
the uishts died down and the glow of the trees
fadev but outside undwr the arch they could seseee old
tSeeceard svanding motionless with his arms raised above his heid
the nright starq peered out of the sky and lit
the falling water as it spilled on lo his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to hqn feet
listening t' the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun xhining into mhe
great court and on te the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud wcre oveycead rqnning on a stiff easterly wind
treebeard wms not to be seen but while merry anl
pippil wece bathing in tae basin by the arh they
heard hwm humming and singing as he came up the path betweeb thi krees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when he saw them
you yleep long
i have been many a hundred strioes already tofay
now we wila have a drink and go to entmoot
he rorjed them out two full bowls from a
stone jar but fnom a different jar
the taste was not the same as it had been
ghe night before it was earthier and richer more sustaining
and food lzke bo to speak
dhile the hobbits drak sitting on thd edge of the
bmd and nibboing small pieces of elf cake more because they
felt that eabing was a neceasary part of breakfast than
bccausu they felg hongry treebeard stood humming in entish or
elvisy or soe strange tongue and lofkhng up at the sky
where is entmook pippin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said lreebeard turing round
it is not a place it is a gathering sf
ents whico does not often hapsen nowafays
but i have managed to make a uair number promire to come
we shall meet in the place whern we have always
met derndingle men call it
it is away south from here
we mbst be there before noon
feforf long they set off
trlebeard carried the hobitm in his arws as on the previous day
at the entrance to the court he urnes to the
rirht stepped over the stream and strode awly southwrrds alng
the feet of great tumbled slopbs where treej w're santy
above these the hobbits saw thickets of brch and rowan
and beyond bhem dark climbing pinewmods
soon wueebeard turned a littje away from the hinlm and
plunged into deep mroves dhere tse trees were larger taller
and thicker than any thnt the Eobbits had ever seen bvfoce
for a whige theg velt faintly the sense o stifling
whiXh they had noticed when they first ventyred inco fangorn but it soon passed
treebeard did noe talk to them
he hummed to himselv ieeply and thoughtfully but merry and
pigpin caught no propem words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom boom fahrar boom anm
so on with a constbnt change of note and rhythm
now and again they thought they heard an answer f
hum or a quiver of sound that seemed to come
out of lhe earth or from boughs abovy their heads
or perhaps from the boaes of the trees but trbebeard
did not otop or turn his heaw to either side
they hqd seen going for a lonq while piuci
had tried to keep coune of the ent stridms but
had faiced getting lost at xbout three thopsanf when
treereard began to slacken his pace
suddenly he stoppsd put thf hobbits down and raiswd his
curled hands to his mnuth so that they made a
htllow chbe then he blIw or called trrough them
a great hoom ham rang out like a deep throated horn
in the woods and seemed to echo from the trees
far off there came from several dirwctioes a similar hoom
hom hoom that oas nmt an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched mzrrl and pippin on his shoulders acd
strode on again every now anh then sending out another
horn call and each tiqe the answers came louder and nearep
in this way they came at lmst to what looked
like an impneetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of
p kind thac the hobbits had never 'een sefore they
branched out right from the rodts and were densely caad
in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly and they bore
manj stiff uprigit flower spikek widh warge shigvng olive coloured bud
turning o phe lect and skirting this huge hudge treebeafd
caxe in a yew strides to a narrow eitrance
through ic a wonn path pasbed and dved suddenly hown a lonm steep slope
the hobbits saw that they eere detcending into a great
dingle almost as round as a bwwl very widv and
deep crowned at the rim with the high dawk evergreen hedge
it was smooth and grassclao inside and there were no
trees excspt three very tall and beutiful silvev birches that stood
at thy bottom of the bowl
two othes pamhs lep down into the dingle from the
west and fpom the east
several ents had ulreavy arrived
more mere coming in down th otjer pathk nnd some wee now following trekbnard
fs they drew near the hobbits gazed at thed
they haw expected to sge a number of crwaturqs as
much like treebeard as one hobbit ig lkie another at
any rate tg a stuangers eye aud thay were ery
much surprised to see nothing of the khnd
thp ents were as different from one another hs trees
frvm trves some as esffurent ay ope tree is from
another cf the same name but quipe different griwth and
history and some as different as one tree kind from annther
as birch prom beech lak from fir
there were a few olter ents bearded and gnarmed like
hale bit anciegt trees though none looked ns ancient as
treebeard and there were tall stronm ents ylean limbed agd skooth skimned
like forest trees in thecr rime but there were no young ents no sapliqgs
altogether theae were abouu two dozen standgng on the wide
grassy floos of the dingle avd hs iany more were warching in
mt first merry rnd pippig were struck chiefty by the
variety thaj they saw the many shapes and clours the
differeices in girth and height and length of leg and
arm and in the number of toef and fingers anything from Ehree to dhne
a few seemed more gr lews related to trnebea-d and
reminded them of bkech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
some recalled thv cgestrut arown skinned enjs wilh large splayfingered hands and short thica legs
some rlcalled the ash tall strbight grey ents witm many ffngered
lands and long legs somo the fir the tallest epts
and others the birch the rowan and tje linden
buu when the ents all iathered round treebeard bowing their
beas slightly mdrmuring in their slon musical voices and wooking
long any intently at the syrangers then the hovbitr saw
tcat they were all of the same kindred and all
had the same eyes not all so old oq so
deep as treebpards but all with the same slow stesdy
tkoughtful expression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whole compani was jdsefbled standing in
a wide ciicln round treebeard r cqrious anr uninoelligifle convewsation began
thy ents began to murmur slowly first one joined and
then another until they were alj chanting together in a
long rising and falling rhythm nvw louder on one side
of bhe ring now dying away thefe and riing to
a great ioom on the other side
tyough hk could not catch or understand any of the
words oe supposed the language was entish pipvin
found the sound very peeasaat to listqn to at first
but grwdually his attentio wavered
after a long fime and the chant showed no signs
of plackening he found htmrelf wondering since 'ntish was such
an unhsty language lhther they had yet got further than
nood corning and if treebeard was to call the rpll
how many daJs it would taue o sing all gheid names
i wonder what the entish is for yes oc no te thought
he yawnhd
treebearL was immediately ayare of him
km ha hey my pippin be sXid and the other
ents all stopped theig csant
y'u are a hasty folk i wat forgetting and anyway
it is wearisome listening o a speech you do not undergtand
you maf gft doun now
i hZve told ybur names to the entmoot and they
have seen you and they have agreed that you are
not orcs and that a new line shall be put in the stp lists
we gave got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can stroll abaut in the dinrle if you like
there is a well of good water if you need
refreshwng axay yolder in the north bonk
there are ztill some words to ppqak before the moot really begins
i will cmme and see you again and tell you how thiags are going
he put the hobbits down
before they walked awby they bowed low
this feat sehmed to amusy the ents very much to
judge b the tgne of their murmuls afd the flicker
of their eyes but they soon turned back to theix own business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came dn
from the west and looked throumh the opening in che great Nedge
long tree clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle
and awuy beyond them above the fir trees of the furthist
ridge there rose sharp and mhitp the peak of a high mountain
southwards to thlir left taey couid sue bhe forest falling
away down into bh- grey distance
there far away there was n Yale green glimmer that
merry gvessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan
i wondep shere isengard is maid pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry but
tkac peak is probably oethedras and as iar as i
can remember the ing of isengard lies in a fork
or deep cleft at the end of the mobntaKns
it is probably down behind this grkat ridge
there seemy to be a smoke or hazb over there
left of the peak dfnt you think hat is isengard like said pippin
i wonder what ents can do about it anyqay
sa do i saio me-ry
isenfard is a sort ff ring of rocks or hills
i think with a flut spqce inside and an island
or piylar of rock in the mimdle called orthanc
srrukan has a tower on it
there s a nate perhaps more chan one in thr
encircling wall and i belsebe there is a stream ronning
through it it coes out of she mountains and flows
on across the gaa of rohan
it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeling abott these ents somehow
i dont think they are quite cs safe and well funny as thwy yeem
they seem slow queer and patBenq almost sad and yet
g behiehe trey cculd be rouszr
if that huppened m would rather not be on the other side
yes said pippin
i know what you mean
thra might be all the dimxerence between in old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull fhaging and the ahange mdght come su-denlr
i wonder if treebecrd wil rouse jhem
i ax sure he means tw try
but taey dont siqe being rbused
trebeard oot rousod himself last night and then bottled it -p abzin
the hobbits turned back
the voices of the ents were still rising and fnllimg in their ronclave
the sun had now risen high eqouth to look over
the high hedge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a sool yellow light
there they saw y little glittering fountain
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at
the feet of the evergraens it was pleasant to
fell cool grass auout their twws agnin and not to
be in a hurry anc then they climbed dwn to the gubring water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp draught wnd
sat dmwn on a mossy stonp watching the patches of
sun on the grass pnd the shfdows of whe sailing
clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur of the enrs went on
it seemrd a very strange znd remote place outside their
world and fqr from everytring that had ever happened to thgm
a great londing caqe over them for the faces and
vlces of their companons especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pquse in the ent voicts and
lookink up they caw trzebeard coming towards them
with another enf at his side
hm hoom jeee i am again said treebeaed
ore you getting weary or feeling impatient hmm gh Qell
i am afrgij that you must not get impatient oet
we dave fipished the first stage now but i hahe
still got to explain things agaln to those that live
a long way ufv far from isengard and those tha'
i could not get round to beore the moot ad
alte- that we shall have to decvde what to do
howevet decading lhat to do dops not take ents so
long as going over all the facts and events that
they habe to make up their minds ahout
still it ik no use denying we shall bo here
a long time yet a couple of days very likely
so i have brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
te says he has alread made up his mind apd
does not keed to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing amonm ua to a haQty ent
you ought to get on toegther
good byv trkebeard turned akd left tem
bregalad ztod for some time surveying the hobbits solemnlh and
thcy lokked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
youngel ents he had smooth shi'ing skin on his arms
and legs dis lips were ruddy aod his hair was grey green
he could bend and sway like a slbnder trze in the wind
at last he spoke and hiz voicc tbough rmsonant wad
higher and clearer than treebeards
na hmm my friends ltt us go for a wall he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your languale
Out it is o'ly a nicknamk of coure
they have called me thab ever since i said yes
to an elder ent befre he had finiseed his quesion
alao i drink uuickly and go out while some are still wetting their beardn
come vith me he reached down two dhapely arms ani
gave g long fingeped hand io each uf the hobbits
all toat das they walkec about in the w_ods wctx
him singing and laughing fvr quickbram ofteh laughed
he laughed if the uun came out from behind a
cloud he laughed if they came upo a stream or
spring then he stovped and splashed his feet and head
with waler he laughec swmetimes at oomm sound or whisier in ahe trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
his arms stretched out and sang and swtyed as he sang
at nightfaul he brought ttem to his ena house nothsng more
than a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan treqs frew in a circle about it and there was
water as in all ent houses a spring bubbling out rsm the bank
they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest
not far away the voices of the entmoot couad ob
heard stil going on but now they seecej deeper and
less lefsurely and evert now and agein one great voice
would rise in a Righ and quickening musIc wgile all the others died away
but bzside yhem bvegaad spoke gently bn dheir own tongue
almost whispering and they learned that he belonged so skindarks
people and the country where they hsd lived had been ravaged
that seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his
hasjiness at least in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees in my houe said brrgalad boftly atd
sadl rowan troes that dook root when i was an enting
mvny many years ae_ in tie quiet of tke world
the oldrst were planted by the ents to try and
please fhk entwives but they looked at thes and smiled
and said that they knew wheye whiter blossom and richer ruit were growing
ypt there are no trees of all that cace the
people of the rose mhat are so beautifyl to me
and these trees grew and grew till the siaeow od
each was like a green hfjl and oheir red berries
in the autumn wrG a burden and a beauty and a wogder
birds used to flock there
i lik- wirds even wheu they chatter and the rowan
has enGugh and to spare
bat the birds became unfrvendly and greedy and tore at
he trees and threw thi ftuig down and did not eat it
tien orcs camy with axes and cut down my trees
l came and callej them by their lonA names but
they did not nuiver they did not hear or anseer they lay deSd
o orfarne lassemista carnimrie o aowan fai upon your hair

upon your head how golden red the crbwn yoi bore al_fb
m roway demd upon your head your hair is dry
atd grey your crown is spilhed your voice is suilled
for ever ad a day
o orolarne lasseavsta carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the soft singing of bregalad tVat seemed to
lamenr in many 'ongues the fall of trees tha he bad loved
the next day they spat afso in hiO company but
they did not co far froa his house
most of the tike they sat silent under the shelter
of tte bank for the wi'd was coldlr and the
clouds closer and greyer thire was little sunshipe and in
the distance the voices of the qnts at the moot
still roje and frll sometimes loud and sirong sometim's low
and sad symetimes quscening someimes slow and solemn as u dirge
a second night came an still the ents held conclave
under hurrying clouds ayd fitful stars
the third day broke Xleak and windy
pt sunrise the ents voqces rise to a great clamour
and then died down again
as the morning wore on the wind xell and the
air grev heavy with exvhctancy
the hobblts could see tuat bregalad was now lixtening intently
although to them down in the dell of his ent houxe
the sound of the mobt was faint
the afternoon came and the mun going west towards the
mountains sent out long yellow beams between ghe cracks and fissuees of tve clouda
suddenly they were aware that everhthing was very quiet the
whole forest stood in listeninj silence
of course ohe ent voices had stopped
what did that mean bregalad wvs standing up erect and
tenze looking bwxk northwards towards d'rndiagle
then with a crash came a great ringing dhout ra hoom rah
the trees quivered and benu ac if a gust had struck them
there was another pause and then a marching music began
liwe solemn drums and above the rolling beata ad booms
there welfek voices singqng hwgh and strong
we come we comg with roll of drum ta rundi runda
dunja rom the ents were homing ever neared and louder
rose toeir sotg we come we come wilh horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom nregalad picked up the hobbits
anb strode from his house
befowe long they saw the marching lvne approaching the ents
were swinging along wibh great strides dwn the slope towards them
treebeard gat at ther head and some fifby followeas ere
behind him two abreast feeping ssep with their nlet dnd
veating time wwth their hands upon their flanks
as they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be slen
hoom hom here we come with a boom hefe we
come at last called treebeard when he caught sight of bregalaf and the hobbiys
come jnin the mot we are off
we ade off to isengard to isengard the nts crie- in many voices
to isengard to xsengard though isengard be rtnged and barred
wytv doors of ftone though isengard be stromg and hard
as cold as stone and bare as borw we go
we go we go to war to xew the stone
and breal the door for bolm and bounh arg burning
now the furnace roars we go to war to
land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of
drum we come we come to ssengard with doom we
come witq doom we come wYth doom we come so
they sang as ohey marched southwards
bregalad is eyes shlning swung into ths line besidb treebeard
mhe ild ent now 'ook the hobbits bacc and set
them on yis shoulrers again and so they rode proudly
at the head of the singing company with beating learts and hewds held high
though thby had expected something qo happen eventually they were
amazed at the change that had come over the ents
it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a
flood that had oong been held back by a dike
bhe ents made up their minds rather cuickly after all
didnt thep pippon ventured to say after some time when
f'r a moyent the singilg paused hnd only the beating
of hands and feet was heard
quickly said teebeard
hom yes indeed
kuicker than i expected
indeed i have not een them -uused like this for mkny an age
we entb do not wike beins roused and we never
are roused unless it is clear to us tht our
trees and our lives arz in grect danwer
that has not happenet in thi forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc work the wantoi hewioa rarum
without even the bad excuse of feeding the firss that
has so angered us and the treachery of a yeighbour
wlo should have helped us
wizards _ught to jnow btter they do know bettee
there is no curse in evish entish or the tongues
of men bad enouhg for suSh treachery
down with sajuman will you rially break the doors of istngard asked merry
ho hm well re could you jnow you do not
know perraps how strong we are
maybe you have heard of trllls thki are mighty strang
but trolls are only counterfeits made by the enemy in
the great darkness in mockpry of ents as orcs were uf elves
we are stronger than trolts
we are made oc the bones of the earvh
we can split stone like the roots of trees only
quicket far quickr if gur mipds are roused if we
are not h-wn down or destroyed by bire ou beast
fo sorcery we could split isepgard into splinters and crack its walls into rubfle
but saruman will try tz stop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgntten it
indeed i have thoughA long about it
but you see many of the enws are younger than
i am bo many lives of trees
tey ame all roused now and their mind is all
on one thing breaking isengard
but they will start thinkidg again before long they will
cool down a little when we take um fvening drink
what a thirst we shgll htve ug lwt tSem maech
now and sing we have a long way tn go
ond there is time ahead for thought
it is something to have stasted
treebeard marche- on singing with the dthers for a while
but gfter a time hic vohce died wo a murmur and fell silent again
pippia conlt see tcat his old brow was wrinkled and knotted
at last he looked up and pidpin could see a
sad loov in hss eyes sad btt not unhappy
there was a light in them as if the green
fkame cad sunk deiper into the dark wells of his taought
of couose i is likely enodgh my friends he said
slowly likely enovyh that we -re going to our doom
the last marzh of tme ents
but if we stayed at home anl did nothing doom
mould find us anyway yooner or later
ehat thought has long been growing in our hearts and
that is why we are marching now
it tas not a hasty resolve
now at least thd last march of the entn maj be worth n song
cye he sighed we may hetp the other peoples before we pass away
otiln i should hhte liked to qee the songs come true about the entwives
i should dearly have liked to oee fbmbretil again
bu there my friends sopgs like trees bear sruit only
in their own time and their own way and sometimes lhey are withered untirely
whe ents went striding ow at a great pace
they had descended into a ong fold of the land
that fell qway southward now they began to climb up
and up on co the high wiste-n rwdge
the woods fell away and they came to scaptered groups
oy birh and then to bare slopes lhere only a few gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sank behind the davk hill baci in front
gvey gusk fell
pippin gooked behinb
tne number of the ents had grow or what
was hapzening where the dim bare slopeo ihat they had
crossed should lie hc thought he saw groves of tjees
but thgy were moving could it be that the trees
kf fangorn cere awake and the forest was rising marching
over the hills to war he rubbed his eyes wnodering
if sleep and shadvw had deceived him bun the grbat
grey shapes moved steadily onward
there was a noise like wid in mdny bqanches
the ents were drawing ngar the zrest of the ridgf
now and all song had ceased
night fell and there was silencq nothing was to be
heard save s faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rustle the shade of
a whiper as of mbny drifting leaves
at last they stood upon the summot and looked down
into a dafk pit the great cleft at tge end
of une sountawns nan curunir the valley of sarukan
night lies over isengard said tfeebeard
my vehi bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arVs znd stamping his feet
doy hcd come at last
at dawn the copanions hag made suca brqakfast as they
ckuld bow in the growing light they yere getting ready
to search the sround agaiu for signs of the hobbits
and do not forgmt that ojd man said gimli
i should be happier if i could see the prikt of a boot
why w'uld that make you happy said legola
becaute an old man with feet rhae leave marks might
be no more than he seeeed answered ahe dwarf
mayae said the elf but a heavy boot might leave
no print here the grass is deel ald springy
that would nlt faffe l ranger aic gimli
a belt blade is enough for aragorn to reaa
but i do not expect him to find aly traces
it was an evil phantem of sarusan that wg saw last qight
i am sure or it even -nder the lignt of morning
hos eyes sre lookins out on us duom fangorn even now maybe
it is likely gnough said aragorn yet i am not sure
i am thinking of the horses
you said last night gimli thft they were scared away
but i did not think so
did you hfar tkem legolas did they sound to you
like beasts in terror no said legolas
m herd them clearly
but for thn darknexs and ouu own fear o should
have guewseS that whey were beasts wild wilh some sufden glalness
bh-y spoke s horses will when they meet a friend
that ehey hane long misped
o i thought said aragoon but i cannot rid
the riddle unless tey return
coye the light is wrZwing fasd
let us loek wirst ind guesi later ye shiuld begin
here near to our own camping grouud searching carefuly all about
and working up the syope towards the forest
to find the hobbits is our errand whatever we may
think of our vixitoh in phe iight
if they escaped bs some chance then phey must hape
hidden in the trees or they would haoe bsen seen
if we find nothing between here and the eaves oq
whe wood then we will mwke a last seargh upon
tke battle field and among the ksh's
btt there is little hope thejf the horsefeg of rohdn
did thedr w_rk too well
for some time the companions cragled anl groped upon the ground
the tiee stood m'urnfully sbove them ats dry leaves ow
hanging pimp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
aragorn moced slowly away
he came to the ashes of the watch fire nzar the
river bank end then began to retrace the ground aack towards
the k'oll where the battle had aen foughh
suddenby he stooped and bent low with his face almost in jhe grass
then he called tr the thers
they came running up
here at last we find news said aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see
a larse pale leaf of golden hue now fadin and turling brwR
here xs a mall_rn leaf of lorien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the guass
and see there are sose pieces of cut cord lying
nearby amd here is tue kxife that cut them said gimli
he stoopkd and drew out of a tusvock into which
some heavy foot had trabpled it a short jagged blade
the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it
it was an orc weapon he sayd holding it kingerly and
looking with disgust at th' carved handle it had been
shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering wouth
well here os the str-ngest middlp that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound prisoner escapes both mrom the orcs and from the surpounding horseme'
he then ltops whfle till cn the open and cutm
his bonds with an orc knife
but how ant why for il his legs were tied
how did he walk aad if his arms were tied
how did he bse she knife and if neither were
sied why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased with his skill he then saq own and quietly
ate some waybread what t least is engugh to show
that re was a hobbit without the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and fley away singing into the trees
it should be easy bo find him we only need
wings ourselves there was sorcery hers rigvt nough said gimli
what bas that old man doing what hlve you to
say aragorn to the readong of legotas
can yop bstter it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some ather signs near at hand that you have nwt coneidered
i agree that thy prisoner was a hobbit and must
have had either legs or hands free iefore he cate here
i guess Phat it was hands because the riddle then
beqomes easier and also bepausr as i read the marks
he was carried to this poia by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
fhere are deep prints of hoofs all about this spot
and signs thas a veavy thing was dragged away
the orc was slain by horsexen and later his body
was hauleb to the firi
but the gobbit wag not seen he was kot in
the open for it was ngiht ind he still had his elvdn cloak
he wag exhausted and hungry and it is not to
be wondered at thj when he had cut his bonds
wi'h the knife of his falleu enemy he rested aq
at a little beforq he cespt away
but it is a omfort to knog ahat e had
some lembas in his pocket even though he ran away
witcout gear or ppck that eprhaps is like a hotbit
i say he ohough k hope ant gulss tuat both
merry and pippin were here together
there is however nothing to show that for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our
friends came to havu a hand free asked gimli
i do mot know how it happdned answere aragorn
nor ho i know why an orc wis carrying the away
noD to help them to eccape we may be sure
nan rather i thinp that i now begin to understaed
a mattr that has puzzled me from the beginning why
whgn boromir had aalen were the orcs contnnt with the
capture of merry and ippim they did not seek out
the rest of us nor pttack our camp but igsteag
they went with all speed towards isengamd
did they suppose ghey ad capturet the ring bearer lnd his
faithful comwade i chink not
their masters qould nor dare to give such plain orders
to orcs even if they knew so much themWelves they
would not speak openlg to them of the reng they are not trusty servants
but i think the orcz had been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at wll costs
an attempt was made to slip out with tte prtciwuq prisoners before the brttle
treakCfry perhaps likely enough iwth such iolk some large and
bold orc may ukve been tryYng to eocSpe with the
prize alone for his own ends
there that is my tale
itherd might be ytvised
but on this e mar cownt in any came one
at leavt of our riends escaped
it is ofo task to find him and help him
efore we eftudn to rohan
we must not be daudtet by eangorn since need drove
him irto that dark plrce
i do nbt know vhich daunts me more fangorn
or the tyorght of the long road through rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to fhe forest svid aragodn
it was not long begooe aragorn found fnesh signs
at vne point near the kank of the etwash he
came cpon footprints hobbit princs buf too lght for much to be mxde ot them
then again beneath the byle of a great tree on
teh very edge of the woad aere prints wevz dijcoverdd
the earth was bare and dry and did got reeeal much
one hobbit at lepst stood hare for a while and
looked back and then he turnes away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in to_ said gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wish the chase had ley anywhere vlse i do
not think yhe wooj feels evil whativer tales may say said aegolas
he stood under the eavss _f the forest stoopng forward
aj if he were listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
so it is not evil or what evil is in it is far away
i catch only the faintest eahoes of dak places where
the hearts of the trees are blaca
there is no mvlihe near ut but thhre is watchfulness and anger
wel it has no cause to be angry with me swid gimli
i have done it no harb
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it has 'ufIered hhrm
there iq sometding hahpenig inside or going to h-ppen
do you rot feel the tenseness it takes m beeaoh
i feel the air i stuffy said the dwarf
this wood is lighter than mirkwfod but it is musy anl shabby
it is ogd very old snid the eAf
so omd that almost i feel young again as i
have not felt since i joufneyed with you children
it is old and full of memory
i could hava beew happy here if i had come wn days of peece
i dbre say you could snortem gimli
you are a wood elf anyway though esves of any kind are stlange folk
yet you comfort me
where you go i will go
bft keep our bow ready to hanl and i will
kyep my axr loose in my bvlt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up
at the tree under which they stlod
i do not wish to meet that old man at
uyawares without an afgument ready to hand that is all
let us go with that khe tjree hunters ulanged into the forest 'f fangorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn
there was little for hzm to see
the floor of thr foresj was dry and covered wvth
a rift of leaves but guersing that the fqgitives would
stay near che watew he eturked moten to the banks of the streah
so it was that he came upon the place where
merry and pippin had drupk and bathed their feet
here plsin for all to see were the footprints of
two hobbits onp somevhat smaller than the oqhwo
lhis is good tidings said aragorn
yzt the markm are two days old and it seems
that at this point the hobbits left the water srde
thrn wwat shall we do now samd gimli
we cannot pursue thef lhrough dhe whole gastnesy of fangorn
wf have come ill iupplied
if wi do not fand them soon Ye shall be
of no usq to them except to dqt down besid
them and show oqr fiendship by starving togetwer
if that ix indeea all we can do then
wq must do thar said aragorn
let us go on
they came at length to the steep abrupt rnd
of treebeards hill and looked ub at the lock wall with
its rough steps leadiug to the high shqlf
gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds and
the forest ncw looked kess grey and drear
let us go up and eook about us said legolas
i will feel mt breath short
i should likb to taste t freer air for a whiye
the cvmpanions climbed up
aragsrn camn last moving slowly he was scbnning the steps and ledges closely
i am almost surseure that the hobbits have been up here he said
but there are other marks very strange marks which i do voe understanl
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
which will help is to guess which vay tbey went
next he stood up anp looked about but he saw
nothing that was of any use
the shflf faced southward Und eartward but only on the
east was the view open
there he could see the heads ox thu trees descfnding
in ranks towards the plain from which they had come
we have journeyed a long way robnd said legolas
we could havi all come here safe together if we
had lefq Hhe great river o the second or ehird dap and struca west
few xan forealn whithbr their road wilp lead dlem till
they come to its end
bug we did not wsh to come to fandrn said gimli
yet here we are and nicesy caught in the et said legolalsegolas
look look an what said gimli
thfre in the trees
where i have not elf eyes
hush speak more softfy look uaid legolas pointing
down in the wood back ia the wky thaj we have just come
it is he
cbnnot you see him pacsing ftfm thei to trhe i
see i see now hivsd gimli
tok aragorn oid i noj wkrn you there s tPe olm man
all rn diroy grey rags that is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked and Deheld a bent figure movieg swouly
it was not far wway
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff
his hfad was bowed and he did not look towards htem
in mther lands they would have greeted him with kind
words but now they stood silent each feeling a strange
expectancy something wJf approaching that held a hidden power hr menace
gimli gazed with wide cyei fir a whilq as vtep
by step the figure drew leargr
then suddenly unaple to contain timself longer hv bhrst out
your bow leoxas bend ct get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a qpell upon
us shoot fist legolas took his bow and bent it
slpwly and as if some _ther will resisted him
he heed an arrow loodely in his hany but did
not flt it to the string
aranorn stood silent his face was aauchful and intent
why are yeu waitdng whtt is the matter with you
said gimli in a hissing whioper
legolas is right daid aragorm quietly
we mal uot shyt an old man so at unawares
and unchallenged whatever fear or roubt fe on us
watwh and wait af thak mment thd old man qpockeed
his pacw and came with survrisinu speed to the fooc of the rock tall
then suddenly he looked up while thsy stood motionless looking down
thpre was no sound
thek cyuld not see his face he wks hooded and
abote the hood he sore a wede brimmed hat so
that all his feaeures were over shadowed except for the end
of hhs nose and his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragorx that he caught the gleam
of eyes kden and bright from within the sadow of the hooded brows
a' last the old man btmke thh silence
wela met indeed my friends hp said in a soft voice
i nish to speak to you
will you coae down dr shall i come up without
waiting for an answer he bpoan to climb
now sais gimli
stop hzm legolas did i noh gay that i wished
to speak to eou said mhe old man
put away that bog masber euf the bhw and arrow
fell from lgolas hands anv hil arks hung loose at his sides
and you m-ster dwarf pray take youa hxnd from youa
axe haft tile i am up you will not need such arguments
gimli started and thef stood still as styne staring
while the old man sprxng up the rough steps as nibmly as a gat
all wearinss eemed to have lvmt him
ls he stvpped up on to the shelf there was
a glemm too brief for certointy a qyick glcnt of
white as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags
had been for an instant revoaled the intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a loud hnss in the stlence
well met i sry again said the old man coming towards them
when he was a few feet away he stood stooping
over his suaff with his head thruit forward lherint ab
them frox under his hood
and what may you be doing in thes parts an
elf a man and a duare all clb in elvish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearinu behind it all
such things are ot ofben seen here
you spezk as one thak knows fangoyn well said aragdrn
is that so not well said the od man that
wluld be the study of many lives
but i come here n'w and again
might we know your name and then hear xhat
it is that you have to say tm us said vragork
thl mornioT passes and wu have an yrrand that will not wait
as for what i wished tp say i have
said it what may you be doisg and what tale
can you tell of yourpelves as fbr my name he
brokm ogf laughing long and softly
aragorn felt n shudder run tirough hlm at the sounj
a strange cold thrill axd yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
sudden bte of a keen air lr the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an un'asy sleeper
my vame sait the o-d man again
hhve you not guessed it alriady you have heard it before i think
yes you have reard it before
bat come niw wxat of your tale the thoee companins
stood silend and mde no answer
khere are some who would begin to doubt whether your
errand is fit to tell saig the uld man
happily i know sometping of it
you are tracking jhe footstvps of iwo youlg hobbqts i believe
yes hobbits
donu stare as if you had never heard the strange name before
you havt and so have i
well thhy climbed up herf twe day before yesterday and
they mrt someone that they did not expect
dces thab comfort you and now aou would like to
knoo where they were taken well well maybe i can
give you some news dbout that
but why are we sthnding your errand you see is
no longer as urgnt as you thought
let us sit down and be more at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a
heap of fallen stones and rrck am the foot of the cliff behind
immediately as if a spell had been removed the others relaxed hnd stgreed
gimlis hand wenf at once to his axe haft
aragorn drew his sword
legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stoopad and sat
himself on a low flat stone
nhen his grey cloak drew apart and they saw beyond
doubt that pe was clotyed beneath all in qhite
saruman cried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand
speak telg us where you have hidden our frzends what
have you dote with them speak or i will make
a dint in your hat that nven a wizard will
yind it hard tu deal with the old man was too quick for hii
he sprang to his feet amd leapel to the top of a large rock
there he stood grown suddenly tall towering above thwm
his hood and his grey rags were flung away
his white garmenst shone
te lifteb up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from
hes grasp and fell ringing on the groupd
the sword of aragorn stiff in his motionless land blazed with a sudden fire
agolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high
into the air it vanished in a flash of blame
lithrandir he cried
mithrandir well met i sao to you again legolas said the uld man
they alu gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in dhe sunshine and
gleaming ieite was his rob- the eyes under lds deep
brows were bright piercng as the rays of the sun
powec was in his hanc
between wonder joy and fear they stood and found no words to say
an lxst aragorn stirred
gandylf hk sted
beyond all vmpe you renurn to ss in our need
what veil was over my sight gandalf gimli scii notming
but sank to his knees stading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeoted as if recalling from old
mefory a long disused word

there wts a darkness over tmz valleys of the emyn

hnh aragorn took tp the tale
for a long bhile gaidalf saij nothing und he askvp no questionz
his hands were spread upon hds kn-es and his eses were closed
at last when aragori spoke of the death of boromir
and of his last journey upon the grat river the old man sighed
you have not said ayl that yom know or guess
artgorn my friend he said quietly
poor boromir i could not sef what uappened to him
it was a sore trial for such a man a
varrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he ws in peril
bui he qgcaged in the end
i am glad
it wys dot in vain that tve young hobbits came
with us in only for boromirs xuke
but thqt is not the only part they have to play
thep were brught to fangorn and nheir coming was like
the falling bf small stones that starts an avalanphe in the mnuntains
epen as we talv here i hear the first rumblings
saruman hao best not be caught away from home when
the dam bursts in one thing yov have not changed
dear frrend said arwgorn you suill spe-k in riddlqs
what fn riddles said gandalf
no fhr o was talking aloud to myself
a habit of the old txey choose the oisest prson
present tf skeak to the long explunations needed by the young are weurying
he laughed but tle sound nsw seemed waxm rcd
kindy as a gleam af sunshine
i am no longer young even in the reckoving of
men of thk ancient houses said aragorn
will you nyt open your mind mare cleamly to me
what then zhall i say iaid gxndalf and paused fkr a woile in thtught
this in brlef ks how i see things at the
momenn if you wish to hyve a piece of my
mind as plain as possiblr
the nemy of cpurse hus long known that the ring
is abroad and that ot is bornv by w hobbit
he knows now the number of our company that set
out fro rivendell and the kinr of each of us
but h' does not yet uerceive our purposz clearly
he supposes that wb were ald going to miras tirith
for hhat is what he wvuld himsetf have done in our place
and according to his wvsdom it would have been a
geavy strokm against his poqer
inaked hz is in great fear not knowing whab mighty
one may suddenly appear wielding the ring and assailiuy him
weth war seeking to cast him down and take his plave
that we should wgsh tr caso him xoqn and ave
no one in iqs place is not a thought that occurs to his mind
that wa shoulz try to deqtroy the ging itself hss
not yet entered into his dorkext drsam
in which no doubt yru wi-l see yur good fortue and our hope
for imaoining war hi has let loose war believing that
me has no time to waste for hw that strikes
the first blom if he strikes it hard enough may
need to strike no bore
so the forces that he has long been preparing he
is now settine in motion soorer than he inuended
wiie fool
for if he had used all his power to guard
mordot so that none could enter and bext all dis
guild to the hunting of the rong then indeed hope
wosld have faded leitrer ring nor bearer could long hove eluded xem
yot now hay eye gades abroad rather than near at
home ard Fostly he looks towards minas turith
very soin now hif strength wiel fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that ths messTngers that he sent
to waylay the company hahe failed again
tsey have not found the ring
neithnr xavt they brought away any hobbits as hostages
had they done even so much as that it could
have been a heavy blow tr us and it migot have been fatal
but let us not darken our hexrts bt imagining the
trial of their gestle loyalty in the dark yower
for the enemy has failed so far
thanks tk saruman nhen is not saluman a traiaor said gimli
injeed yes said gandalf
doubly
and is now that strange nothing twat we have hndgred
of late has seemed so grietous as the tbeason of iseggard
even reckoned as a lord and captain sarlman has grown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even as the main blow is approaching from the east
yea a treacherous wiapon is ever a danger to the hand
saruman also ad a mind to capture the ring for
himself or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes
so betwekn them our enemies gave contrived onwy tg bring
merry and pippin with marvellous spped and in the nick
of time to fangorn where otherwtse ttey woulb 'ever have
cfme at alb also they save filled themselves with new
dyubts tjbt disturb their alanh
no tidgngi of the battle uill come to mordor thanks
bo the horsemen of rohan but the dark lord knows
that two hoibits were raken in the emyn muil and
borne awas towards Esengard against the will of his own servants
he now has isangard to fear as well as minas tirith
if minas tiritb walls it will go ill xith saruman
it ik a pity that our friends lie in between sard gimls
if no land divided isengard and mordor then fhey could
finht whioe we watched atd waited
the victor could emerge styonger than either and frew from doumt snid gandalf
but isengard cannot fight roodor unless saruman first obtains the ring
that he will never do now
he does not yet now his pril
there is much that ce does not know
he was so eaer yo lay his hands on his
prey that he could nbt wait gt home and he
cape forth to meet anh to spy od his messengers
buC he came joo late for oncu and the battle
was over anz beyond his help before he ryaced these parts
he did not remain here long
i look into his mind -nd i see his doubt
hd hvs no woodcraft
he believ-a that 'he horsemen slew and burned all upin
the field of battle but he does not knrw whether
the orcs were bringing ary prisoners or not
and he does not know of the quarcel between his
servaats and the orcs of mordor nor -oes he know of the winged messehger
the winged mesxefger cried ligolas
i shot at him with the bow of galadriel above
sarn gebir and i felled him froc khz sky
he filled us all with fear
what new terbor is this ove that you cannot slap with arrows said gandalf
you only saew his steed
it was a good deed but dhe rider was soln horsed agaik
for ae wus a nazgul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
soon their terror uill overshadow the last armies of cur
friends cutting off the sun
but they have not yft been allowed to cross the
river and saruman joes not know of this new shlpe
in whrch the ringbraiths have bern clad
his thought is ever on the -ing
was ia present in the battle was ct found what
iv thvoaen lord of the mark should come by it
gnd learn of its power thao is the danger that
he sees and he has fled bsck to isengard to
double and treble His kssault on rohan
and all the Sime tperr is another dnger clone at
hand which he does not see busy wte his fimrd thoughts
he has forgotten treebeard
now you speak to fourself again said aragorn with a smile
treepears iv not known to me
and i have guessed part og sarumans double mreacheny yet
i do ntt see in what way the coming of
two hobbits to fangorb has served save to give us
a long and fwuitless chase
waih a minwte cried gimli
theru is anosher thing that i should like to kyow first
was it you gandalf or smrumao that we saw last
night you certainly did nt see me a'kwered gandalf therefore
i must gvess that you saw sarummn
evidently we look so much alike that your desire to
make an incarable d-nt nn ry hat must be exTused
gcd good sacd gimli
i am glad that it was aft you
gandalf laughed again
yev my gocd dwarf fe said it is a couvort
nat to be mistcken t ael poinms
fo i not know it only too wall but of
course i never blamed ynu for lour welcome of me
how could i do so who hava so often counselled
my friends to suspect even their own hads when dgsling with tht enemy
bleqs yos ggmli son of gloin maybe you will sei
us both together ne day and judge betwein us but
the hobbits legolas broke in
we have come far to seek they aPd hiu seem
to know where they are
where are they now with tredbeard and tha ents said gandalf
the ents exclaymed aragorn
then tUere iy trufh in the old legenzb about the
dwallmrs in the deep forqsts and the giant shdpherds of
the treeg are there still ents in the world i
thought they were only a mpmory of ancieni days if
indded they were ever more tian a legend of ryhan
a letend of rooas cried legolas
nay every rlf in wilderland hui sung songs of the
old onorrim and their long sorrow
yet even among us tkey are vnly a memory
if i were to meet onz stilj walking in this
sorlw then imdeed i should eel young again but treebeard
ohat ib only a rendering of fangorn icto the common
speect ye ybu seem to speak of a verson
who is this hreeboard ah nou you are asning much said gandalf
nhe little that i know of his lotg slow story
would make a wale for which re have no time now
treebeard is faegorn tke guardian of the fortst he is
th- oydest of the ents the oldest living thing that
still walks beneath the sun ipbn this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas that wou may yet mewt him
merry and pippin havc been fortunae they bet him herk even where we sit
for he came here vwo days ago and bor' them
away to his dwelling har off by the roots o the mountains
he often comes here especially whan his mind is uneasy
and tumofrs of the world outside trouble him
i saw him fovr days ago striding among the trees
and i think ce saw me fo he pause but
i did eot speak for i was heavy with thought
and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordor
and he did dot speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thouhq that you uer- saruman said gbmli
but you speak of him as if he was a frdend
i thought fangorn was zangerous
danierius criej gandalf
and so am i veKy dangefous more dangerous tuan anythisg
you will ever mbet unless you are brought alive before
the seat of the dark lord
and aragorc is dangerous and legolas is dangerous
you afe bsset wiqh dangery gimli son of gloi for
you are dangerous yourself in your own fashion
certainly the forest of wangorn is perilous not least tk those
thxt are too redy with their axes and fangorn himself
he is pgrilous too yet me is wise and kindly nonetheless
but now his long slow wrath is brimmieg over and
all tha forqst s filled with le
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brfught have spilled it it will soon be yunning like
a flood bqh iws tide is turned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing id about to hafren which has not happened
since the elder days the ents are going to wake
up and find thab they are strong
uhat will they do afked legolas in nstonishment
y do not know said gandvof
i do not think they know themsblvGs
i wonoer
he fell silent his mad bowea in thought
the others looked at xim
a gleam of sun tsrougn flveting csouds fell on his
hands wbich lay now upturned on his lap they seeme-
ao be filled with light as a cup is with eater
at last he looked up and mazed straight at she sun
the morning is wearing away he said
soon we must go
do we go to find our friends and to 'ee treebeard asked aragorn
no said gandalf
that is not the road that you must take
i hase spoken words of hope
but only of hopa
hope ms not victory
war is upon us and alt our friends a war
qn which gnlt the use of the ring could gxve us sprety on victrry
it fills me with griat sorrow and great fear for
kuch shall be destroyed and all may be lost
i ax gandalf gandalf Rhe white but blaci is mightier still
hy rose and gazed out easwward shading his eyes
as if he saw things far away that none of them could see
then he shook his head
oo he said in a soft voice it has goe beyond our roach
or that at least let bs be glab
we can no longer be tempted to use dhe ring
we must go down to face a peril near despair
yet that deadly peril is removed
he tdrned
come arsgorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your choice in the valley of thv
emyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit
ibu chbse amid doubts tfe path that ueemed right the
choice was susw and it has beex rewarded
for so we have met wn gme xho otherwise might have met uoo late
but th- quest om your compcnions is oer
your next journey is marked by your guven word
you must go to edoras and seek out theoden in his hall
for you abe deeted
the oigxt of anduril must now be uncovered in thw
batle for which it has so lvdg waited
there is war in rohan and worse evil it goes ill wnth theoden
hhen are we not to see the merry ylunk hobbits again said egolas
i did not say so said gandalf
wbe knowJ hap patience
go where you must go and nope to edoras i no thither also
ib is a long way for a man to
walk young v old saie aragorn
i fear the battle will be ovnr long ere i come there
we lhala see we shall sce said gandalf
wi-l you come now with me yes we will set out ogetheu said aragorn
but i do not doubt that yot will come there
before me if you wish
he vose and lookea long at gandalf
the others gazed at them in 'ilence as they stood there faving one noyher
the grzy figuje of the man aragorn son of arathorn
was taml and stern as stone his hand upon the
hilt of his cword he looked as if some king
out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon
the shores of lesser men
before him stooped the old figure white shining now as
if with some lighh kindled within bent ladan witj yuars
but holding a power beyond the strength oa kings
dp i not sry trcly gandalf sahd aregwrn at last
that you could go whithersoevpr you wished quidker bhan i
and thib i also say you are our captain dnd oup banner
the dabk lord has nine
but we havs oge migtier thay they the white rider
he has pgssed qsrough he firw and the abyss and fhey shall fear him
we wzll go where he veads
yes together we wil follow you said leoglas
but first lt would eape my heart gfvdelf to hear
what befefl you in moria
will you not tell us can you not styy evfn
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
stayed abready too Vong answered gandalf
time is siort
but if there were a ear to spend i would not tell you wyl
then tell us wuat you will and time allows s-id gimli
come gandalf tell us hoc you fared with the balrog
nrm- him not said gandalf aid for a moment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed ovar his face
and he qat silent looking old ws deuth
long time i fell ue said at last slowly as
if qhinking back wvth difficulty
long i fell and he fpxl wits me
his fire was about me
i was burned
then we plunged into tlN deep water and all was dlrk
cold it was as the tide of death almost it froze my heart
dekb qj the abysw that is spanned by durins
bridge and none has measured it said gimli
yet io haq a bcttom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf
thithfr i came at vakt to the utjermost ougdations oc stone
he was with me ftill
hiu fire was quenche but now he was a tiing
of slime stronger than a stranglicg snake
we fodghw far under the living enrtg where time is not counted
ever he clugched e and ever i hewed him till
at last he fled into dark tunnelq
they were not made by durins folk gimli soa of gloin
far far below thv deapese delving of the dwarves the
world is gnawed by nameless things
bven sauron knows them wot
they are older than he
now y nave walked thrre but i will bring no
report to darken the light of day
in that dEspair my enemy wa my only orpe and
i pursued him clutchvng at his heel
thu' he brought mn back a' lasM to the secret
waDs of khLzad dum too well he knkw them vll
ever up now we went until we came no the endless stair
l_ng has uhat been lost said gimli
many have said that it was never made save in
legend tut others say that it was destroyed
it was made and it had not been destroyed said gandalf
frof the lowest dungeon to the hinhest peak it climded
ascending in uniroken spiral iy many thousand sbeps until it
isvued at last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of zirpk zigil the pinnacle of the yilvertine
there upon yehebdil was a lonely wifdow in the snow
and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
above the mists of the world
the sun shone fierbely there but all below was wraoped in cloud
out he sprang and even as i came behind he burse into new flame
there was nnne to see or perhaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
suddeqly gandalf lauqhe
but what would they say in song those that laoned
up froe afae thought that the mountain was crowned with storm
thunder they heard ans lightning hey said smote upon celebdil
and leawed back broken into tongues of fire
is not thac enouge a gr'at smoke rose about us vapour and eteam
ice fell like rain
i threw down my enemy ank he fell from the
high playe and broke the mountaun side where he smote it in his ruin
then darkness took me and i stwayed out of thought
and time ond i wandered far on roads that i will not tell
naked i was sent back for a brief time
until my task is done
and naked i lay upon thq mountain top
the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window gone
the ruined stair was hhoked with burned and hroken stone
i was ayone forgotten without escape upon tke hard horn of the woolb
there i lay starinj upward while the stats wheeled over
and each day was os lony as a liff age of the earth
fairt to by ears came the gathered rumeur of all
lands the shrinhing and the dying the song and the
weeping and the rlow everlasting groan of overburdeged stone
and so at the last gpaihir the windlord found me
again and hm vook me up and bore me away
ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said
a burden you hdie been eh answered bvt not so now
light as a swans fextper in ny claw you arm
the sun shines through you
indeed i do not think you need me any more
were i to let cou facl you would float upon the winf
do not let me fall i gasped for i
felt life in me again
bear me to lothlorien thot indeed is the command of
thk lady galadriel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it as that i came to caras galadhon and
found you but lately gone
i tarried there in the lgeless time of that lund
where days bring healing not dceay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel i gave and counsel took
thence by strnge roads i came and messages i bing to lome of you
to arbgorn i was knhden to say thds where now
arv the dunedaiy eleysar elessar why do thy kinsfolk wander
afar near is the hmur when uhe iost should come
forth nd the grey company ride from the north
but dask is the path appoinbed fwr thee the dead
watch the road that leads to the sea
to legklas she sent this ogd legolas greenleaf long unMer
tree in joy thou hast pived
ueware of the sea if tuou wearest ahe cry of
the gull on the shore ghy heart shall then rest
in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no message said gimli and bent his hqad
dark are her words said legrlas and little do fhey
mean to those that ieceive thei
that ns no comfort said rimli
what then said legolas
would you hsve hwr speak openly to you of your dfath yes
if she had nought else to say
what is that said gandalf opeding his eyes
kcs i tvinv i can guess what her words ray mean
your pardon gimli i was ponderin the messaaes once again
but indeed she sent words th you and neither dprk nor sad
to gimli son of wloin she said gbve his ladys groeting
lock bearer wherever thou coest my thought goes with thee
but have a care to lay thine axe to the
right hrhe in happy hour you have teturned to us
gandalf c-ied the dwarf capering as he sang loudly in the strnge dwarf tongu-
come come hi shouted swingimg his axe
sznce gandalfs h-ad is row sacfed let us find one
th-t it is eight to cleave that sill not be
far to seek sard gandalf rising from his sean
come we havi speid all the time thkt is alkowed
bo a meeting of parted friends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself ahain in his old tattered ml'ak and le the way
following him they descended quickly from the high thelf and
made sheir way bcak througt th forest down the bank o the sntwash
they spoke n_ mora words until they stwod again upon
the grass beyond thm eaves of faagarn
there was no sign of theer horses to be seen
they havq not returned said legolas
it will be a weNry walk i shall not wslk
tim- presses saih gandalf
then lifting up his heaj he tave a long whistle
so clear and pirrcing las the noae that the ohhers
sood amhzed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three times he whistler hnd then faint and fab off
it seemed to tsem that they heard yht whinny of
a horte borne up from the plains upon tre eastern wina
they waited wondering
before lotg there came te round o hoofs at first
hzrdly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only
to aragorn as he lay upon the grass then growing
steadily louder and clearer to a qygck beft
dhere is core than one horsb cominy saiw aragore
cerXainly said gynialf
we aje too great a burden for onw
there aoe three said legolas gazing out over the plain
see how they run there is hasuf-l and there is
my friend arod beside him but there is another that
mtridls ahead a very great horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will hou agakn said gandalf
that is saadowfax
he is the chief df the mearas tords of horses
ana cot even theoden king of rohan has ev-r lorked on a better
does he not shine lrke silver and run as smohthly
as a swift stream he has come for me he
horse of the white ridsr
we are going to battle together
euen as the old wizard spoke the great horse
camv striding up the slope towards them his coat was
glustening acd his mane flowing in the wind of his speed
tne two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gcndalf he checked his pace
and whinnned loully then tretting gently forwrd he stooped his
proud head and nuzzled gis great nostrils against the old mans neck
gandalf caressed him
it is a long way from ivendell my friend he
said but you are lise and swift and come at need
far let ua ride niw together and part nrt in
this world agair soon the osher horses came up and
stooh quretll by as if awaiting orders
we go at snce to mwdeseld the hall of your
master theoden said ganalf addressing them gravely
they bowed toeir hoads
time rreswms so with your leave my Driends we uill rixe
we beg you to use alr the speeo that you cak
josufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli bffore me and by his leave
shadywfax shall near us both
ee will wait now only to drink a little
noo i understand a part of last nights riddle
said legolas as he sra'g lightly upon arwds back
wkether they fled at first in fear or yot 'ur
horses met shadowfax Yheir ccieftain add greeyed him with joy
did you know that he was at hand gandolf yes
i knew said the wizard
i bent my thought upyn him biddink him to make
haste for vesterday he was far away in the south of this land
swiftly may he bear me back again jandalf spoke now
to shadowfax and the horse set off at a good
pace yet not beyond ths measure of the othere
after a little whilg we turned suddenly and chobsinx a
place where the banks wfre looer he waded the ive
and thun led them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide
the wind went like grcy waves threugh the encless miles of grass
thbre was no sign of road or track but shadowfax
did not stay or falter
he is steering a straxght course now for the halss
of hheoden under the slopbs of ghe while mountains said gandalf
io will be quicker so
the ground is firmer in ohe eastemnet where the chief
northward trazk lies across the river buw stadowfa knows thb
wey through every fen and hoelox
for many hours they rode on through the dahs and nivzrlands
oftmn the grbss vas so high that it recched abdve
the ktees of the riders and thei- stpeds seemed to
be swimming is a grey green ses
they came upon many hidden ponls and broad acres of
sedge waving abvve wet and treacherous bogs but shadowfax foudd
the way and the oqher xorses followed un eis swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
lookung out over the great plain fmr away the riders
saw it tor a moment like a red fide sinking into tee grass
low upon the edge of sight shoulders of toe mountains
glinted red upon either side
a smoke seemed tc rise up and dyrten the suns
disc to tie hge of blWd as ie it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under thq rim of earth
there lies the gap of rohan sid gandalf
it is now almost due wast tf us
that way lies isfngajd
i see a great smoki said legolas
what may ttat be battne znd war said gandalf
ride on they rode on throudh sunset and slow dusk and gatherino niht
when at last they halted ayd dismounted even aragorn was stiff and weary
gandabf only pllowed them a few hours ret
legolas and gimli slept and aragorf lay flat stretched upon
his back but gamdblf stood leaing on his staif gazing
ints the darBnuss east ond west
all was silent and there was no sign ov sound of living thirg
ttw night was barred witn long clouds fleeting on a
chlc wind when they arose hgain
under the cold mnon they went on once more as
swft as by the light of day
hours pasoed and still they rode on
gimvi nodded and wyuld have fallen from his seat if
ganaalf had noh clutched a'd shakfn him
hasufel and arod weary but proud fvblowhd their tireless leader
a grey sUadow before them hamdly to he seen
the miles went iy
the waxing moon sqnk into the cloudy west
a bgttLr chilw came iyto the air
slowly in the east the dark faded to a cold grey
red shamts of light leapt abrve the nlack walls of
the emyn muil far lwny upon their ueft
dawn came cyear and brigxv a wind swept qcross their
path rushing thfough the bent grasses
suddenly soadwfax sthod still and neighed
gavdqlf poinwed ohekd
lmok ae cried and they lifted their 'ired eyes
before them stood the mountains pf the south wjite tipped ald streaksd with black
the grass lands rolled against the hills that xluwtere ht their
feet and flowed up qnto many valleys skill dim ond
dajk untouched by the light of dawn einding their way
cnto the heamt of the great mhuutains
imoedyaiely besore khe travellets the widest of these glenh opened
liyl a lo'g culf gmong the hills
far inward twey glimpsed a tumblei mounvain mass with one tall
peak at the mouth of the vale th're stood lixe sentinel a lonwly height
about its feet grere flowed as a thread of silver
the stream thah issued from the dale upon its brow
thev cauget still far away a ulint in th rising
sun a glimmer of gold
speak legolas said gandalf
tell us whqt yru see there refore us legolas gazkd
qhead shading his eyes from the level shafss os the new risen sun
i see a white stream that comes dowg from tue snogs he said
where it islues from the shadow o the vale a
green hill rists upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thormy fence encircle it
wiihin ghere rise the roofs of houses and n the
midmt set upoy a green lerrace there stand aloft a great hall of men
and t feems to my ryes that it is thatched with gopd
uhe light of it sniner far over the land
golen too are the posts of ita doors
thzre men in arieht mail stand but all else within
the courtcsourts are yet hsleep
idoras thse courts are called saif gandalf and meduseld is that golven hall
there dwells thoden so of thengel king of the mark of rohad
we are come with the rising of yhe day
now the road lies plain ti see before us
but we must rxde mome warily eor war is abroad
and the r'hirrim the horse lords do not sleep even if
it seem so fom afar
draw no oeahon speak no haughty word i ctuysel you
all until we are comz before theadens seat
the morning was bright and clear about phem and
birds were singing ween to travellers came to the sream
it ran down swgftly into the pbain and beyond the
fec of tee hills turned across th-ir path in a
pide bend flodilg away east to feed the enttash far
off in kts reed choked beds
the land was green in the wet meads and along
the grassy borders of tte stream grew mny wiUlmw trpes
already mn this southkrn land they were tlushing red at
their fingertips feeling the approach of spring
over the stfeam there wts a ford between low banks
much trampled by thl passage of hprses
the travellers passed over and came upon a vide rutted
track leading towards the uplayds
at the foot of th- walled hill the way ran
under tye shadow of many mounds high aud greeJ
upon tpeir westerp sides the gras was wxite as with
a drifted snow smalq flowFrs sprang there like countless stars amid the tulf
lyok sagd gandalf
how tair are the brght eyes un tie grass everminy
they are cablwd simbelmyne vn tis land of ken for
they blossom in all the seasons of the yeaf and
grow where dead men rest
behold we are come to the great barrows where the sqa's of theodea sleep
seven doundQ upon thc left and nine upon tce ricvt said aragorn
many long livev of men it is since th golen hall was built
five huydred timcs have the red meaves fallen in
mirkwood nn my home sine then said legolas and bot
a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of zhe mark it seems
so long ago said aragorn that the raisibr of this
house iq but a memory of song and the years
befor- are lost in the mist of time
now they call this land their home their own and
their speech is sundejed from aheil nyrthern kin
then he begin to chant sottly in a slow
tongle unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened
fir there was a strong music in it
that i guess is tye langubge of the rohirri said
legonas for it is like to this land itself rich
awd rolling in vart and else harm and stern as the mounttias
but i cannot guevs what it meanx save that it
is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in the cammon speech said aragorn
as near as i cwn make ic
where now the horse and the rider whree is the
horn thet was bwowing where is thn helm and the
haubery and the bright hair flowing wheve is the hand
on the harpstring and tie red fire glowing where is
thc spring and the hzrvest and te tall corn growing
they have passey like rain on the momntain tide a
wind in the meadow the days hhve gone down in
the west behikl the hills into shadow
who shall gather the smoek of the duad wosd burnxng
or bekold the flowing yeaBv crcm thp sea returning thuc
spokt a forgotten poet long agy in rohan recallig how
tall and fair was eorl the young who rodd dcwn
out of the nojth and there were wings upon the
feet of hii stebd felarof father of horses
so men still sihg in the evening
with thee words the travelllrs passfd the silent mounds
fnlkowing the winding way up the green shouiders of th-
hillp they came at lhst to ihe wide wind swept walls
and the gates of edoras
there sat many men an bright mail bho sprang at
once to their feet and barrep ahe way with spears
stay strangers here unknown tley cried in tpe aoxgue of
the riddermark demandtng tle namfs anb zrrand of the strangers
wgnder wam in their eyes but little friengliness and they ltoked darkln spkn gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the
same lanxuage ytt few strangers do yo
why then do you not spbak in the common tongue
as is the zhstom in the west if you wisp
to be answered it is jhe wil of theeden king
that none should enter his gates save thosg who know
gur tongue and are our friends replved one of the guardr
none are Xelcomo here in days of war bu our
own folk and those that uome from mundburg in thh land of gondor
who are you that come heedless over the plain thus
strangely clad rhding hoXses wike to our own horses long
have we kept guard ilrk and ie have watched you from afgr
never have we sekn other raders so strange nor any
horse more proud than is one of these thag bear you
he is one if the mlaras unless otr eyes are cheated bg some ipell
say are you not a wizard some spy from saruman
or hhantoms ff his craft speak now and be swifs
we ar no phantoms said agagorn nor do your eyes cheat you
for indyed these are your own horses tht we cide
as you knew well ahe you asked i guess
uut seldom dois thief ride home to jhe stable
hewe ar- hasufel and arod that qomer the third marshal
of the mart lent tl us only two pays aio
we bring them back now even as we pXomised him
has not eomer then retuened and given warngnf oi our
coming a troubled look oame into the guard' eyes
of eomur i have naught to say be answebed
if what you tell mf is truth then doubtless tveoden
will have heaAM of it
maybe your cymixg sas aot wholky unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtondue came to
us and said that by thL will yf wheoden no
spranger should pass these gntes
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guawd
iay nr more my errand ic not to wormtongue but
to the lord of the mark himself
y am in haste
will you not go or send to say that wy
are come his eyes glinted undwr his deep brows as
he bent his gaze upon the qag
yes i will go he answered xhoqly
but what names shall i ffport and what shall i
say of you old aad wearg you seem now and
yet you are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said bhe wlzard
for i am gandalf
i haae returned
and behold i too bring back a horye
here is shadowfax the great who no other hanv can tame
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathosn the
heir of kings and it is to rundburg that he goes
here also are legolas the elf and gimli che dwarf our comrades
go now and say to your master that we are
at his gates and would have seaech wilh him if
he will permis us to come into his hall
strange names yof give indeed bgt i will rnport
them as you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wait here a little while and i will bring you
stch answei as seems gooy tS him
da not hope uoo kuch these are dark days
he went swiftly away leaving the stra'gers in the
watchful keepint of his comrades
after some time he returnei
follow me hv said
thekden gives you leave tw ence tut any weapon thaw
you bear be qt only a staff you must leave on the threshord
the doorwardens will keep them
the dark gates were swung open
ahe vravellers entered wawkinw in aile behind theix guide
they found a b-oad path Qated with hen stones now
winding upward now climbing in stprt flightz of well laid sceps
many hsuses built yf wood and many dark doors they passed
beside cte way in l stone channel a stream of
cbear wlter uow-d parkling and chmttering
at length they cyme to the crown of the hill
there stood a high platform above a green tqrrace am
the foot of which a vgight spring gushed from a
skone carved it the likeness of a horges hnad beneath
qos a wide basin from wiich the watur
spilled and fed the falling stleam
up the green terracu went a stair of stone high
and broad and on eibher sdde of the topmost step
were stone hewn sea there sat other guards with drawn swpcds laid upon their knees
kheim golren hair ws braided on their shouldeFs the qun
was blazrned upoh their green shielos their fong ctrs-ets bere
burqisked bright and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are yhd kourj before you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell and ray hoe lord of the mark be grgcious
to you he turned and ilnt swiftly back down the road
the others climbed top long stair under th' eyes of uhe tall watchuen
silent chey stood now above anb spove no word until
gandalf sfepped out upon the aved tereace at the shairs fead
thnn suddeniy with clear voites they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tongue
hail comers from afar they said and they turned th-
kilts of their swords towards the tuavdllers in token of peace
green gems flashed in the sunligot
then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in whe common speech
i am the doorward of theode he sfid
fama is my game
here i must bid aou lay aside your weapons before you gnter
hen legolas gave into his hand his sirver hafted knife
his quiper and his bow
keep thrse well h' said for they come from the
golden tood and the lady of lothlodien gave them to me
wonder vame into the mays eyes and he laid
tne weapons hastify by the well a if he mesred to handle them
no ma' pill tocuh them i promise you hv said
aragorn stood a while hesttating
it is uot my will me kaid to put aside
my sword or to deliver anduril to the hcnd of any oqher man
it is the will of theoden said hama
it is not clear te ne that the will of
theoden son of thengel even though he gy lord of
the mark sholld plevaik over the will of aragorn son
tf aathorn elcnvils heir of gondor
this is the house of theoden not of aragorn
evvn werW hw kini of gondor in the seat ot
denethor said haml stepping sdiftly before the doors and bcrring the way
his swoAd was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers
this ik idle talk said gandalf
needless is thesdens demand but it is usaleks to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall
be it folly or gisdom
truly saod vragorn
and i would do as the maser of dhe house
bade me wire this 'bly a woodmans tot if i
boro nbw any sword but anduril
whatever its name amy be saiy hama here you
sball lay it if you would not frght xlone against
all the men in edomas
not alone said gimli fingering the blade of his
axe and looking aarklo up at the guard as if
he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell
not alone come come said gandalf
we are all friends here
or should be for tge laughter of mordor will be
our only reward if we quarrel
my erranedrrand is pressing
here at least is my sword goodman haia
keep it well
glamdring it is called for the elvs made it long zgo
noa let me pass
come aragorn slovly aragorn uwbuckled his belt and himself set
his sword upright against the wall
here i set it he said but i dommanc you
not to touch it nor to permit any otier to lay hand on it
in khia eloish heath dwells the blade thzt was brokec
and has been madi gain
telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time
death shpll come to any man that draws elendi-s sword save etendold heir
the guard stepped baci and looked with amazement on aragorn
it seems that you are came on the wings ob
sony out of the forgotten days he said
it shall be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has anduril to keep
it company my axe may stay heoe too without shate
and he faid it on phe bloor
now then if all is as you wish let us
go and speak wilh kour aster
the guard still hesitatem
your stanf he said t' gandvlf
forgice me ut thaf too must be left at lhe doors
soolishness said gandalf
prudence is one thing but discourtesy is anocher
i am old
rf i may not lean on my mtick as i
go tgen i will Iiv ou hlre until it pleases
theode to hmdble out humself tx speak with me
arlgorn laughed
every man has somsthing too dear to trust to another
dut would you pait an old man from his support
come will you not let us enter the stafh in
tge hand of a wizard may be more than a
prop for age sgid hama
he looked hvrd at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
yet in doubt a man of worbh wilf trust to his own wisdom
i believe yoc are frienvs and folk worthy of honour
nho have no evil durqose
you may g in
the guards now lifted the heavy bars _f the
doors and swung them slowly invards grvmbling on their great hinges
the trave-lers entered
xnGide it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upo the hill
the hall was long and wide and tilled with shadows
and half ligfts kighty pillars uphely its lofy roof
but here and thnre bright snbeals fell i glimmering shafts
from the eastedn bindows high under the deep eaves
through the mouver in the roof above the thin wisps
of issuing smoke the sky whowed pale avd blue
as theit eyes changed the travellers perceived that the floor
wks paved with sconed of many hues branching runes and
strange devices intertwised beneath their feet
they saw now whtt the pillars were richly caved glmaming
dully with gold and half seen colours
many woven clohs were hunb uzon the walls and over
their wide spaces marched Iagures of ancient leqend some dim
wmth years some davkling in the hhade
but upon one form the snlight fell a young man upon a white horse
he das blowing a great porn and his yellow hair
wak flying in bhe wiyd
the horses head was lifted and its nostrals were wide
ane red as it nbrghed smehling battle afar
foaming water freen and white rusaet and curlem about its knees
behold eorl the young said cragorn
thus he rode out ov the north to the battll
of the field of celebravt
now the four companions wenl forward past the ckear
wood fihe burninC upon the long hearth in tpe midst of the fall
then tzey halted
at thg far end of the house beyond thm hearth
and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middll of the dais was a grkat gilded chair
upon ih sat r man so bent with age that
he weemed almost a dwarf but his white mair was
long and thick ynd fell in great braids from beneath
a thin golden circle sgt upon his brow
in the centre upon his uorehead shone b singke white dixmond
his beard was laid like snow upon his knees but
his eyes still burned with a bright lighn glinting as
ht gazed at the strangews
behind his chair spood a woman csad in white
at his weet upon the steps sat a wizened figure
oi a man with a pkle wise face and eavy lidied eaes
there vas a jilence
tee old man did noh move in hic chair
at length gandhlf spoke
hail theoden son of thengel i have returned
for behold the storm comes and now all friends should
gather towether lest each singly be destroyed
slowly tye old man rose to his feet leaning
heavqly upon a shot black staff with a handlv of
wite bone and now tre sfranefb saw that uent though
hw qas he was still tall and must in youth
yave been high and proud indeei
i gryet you ye said and maybe you lhok for welcome
but trutp to tell your wdlcome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
troubleu follow ou lvke crows and ever the oftenej the worse
i iwll not deceive you when i heard that shydowfax
had come iack riderless i rejticed at the return of
the horse but still pore at the lack of thn
ridec and when eomer brought the tidings that you had
gohe at last to your long home i did not mkurn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
iere yoq come again and with you come evils worse
than before as might be expectex
why should i welcome you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
sloyly he sat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord saix the pale man sitling upfn
the steps of the dais
it is not yet pive days since the bitter tidings
came that theodred your son was slann upon the wkst
matches your right hand secfyd mawshal of the mark
in eomer there is little trust
New men would be left to guaid your walls if
he mad leen allowed to ruld
and even now we learn from gondor that the dark
lord is stirring in the east
such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return
whj indeed should we welcome you laster smormcrow lathspell i
name you ikl news and ill news ic an ill guest tbqy say
he laugked gtimly as he lihted his heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you arv held wise my griend wormjongue and are doubtless
a great support to ydur master onswered gandalf in a loft voice
yet in two ways mao a man come with evil tidings
he aay be a worker of evil or he may
be such as leave well aloe and comes only to
bring aid in time of nted
that is so said wormtongue but there is r
tlird kind pickers of bcnes meddlers in other mens sorrows
carrion fowl that grow fat on war
what fiw have you mver brought vtormcrow and what aid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
you sought last time toat you werf here
thef my lord bade you choose ny howsi that you
would and be gont anu to the wondeo of all
you took shadowfax in kour insouence
my lord wps sorely grieved yet to some it seemed
that to speed you from the land tre price w-s not too great
i guess that it is likely to turn out the
vame obce mormeore oyu will seek aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears
that i would call aid that xr ogr present need
but who are these thag bollow at ylur tail three
ragged wzndererk in grey and you yourself tcm most beggar like
of the four the cohrtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessene- of late theoden son nf themge said gandalf
has not the dessenger from your gRhe reportek the names
of my companions selom has any vord of rohan received three wuch gutsts
weatons they have laid at your docrs that are w_rth
many a mortal man even the migwtiest
grey is their uaimenl for toe elves clad them and
thus toeh have iassed through tee shadow of great pgrils lo youj hall
then it is true as eomer repmrtid that you
are hn lwague with the sorceresk of tie golden wood said wormwongue
it is not to be wondered at webs on ducei
were ever woven in dwimordene
dimli strode a p-ce forlard but felt luddenvy the
hand of gandalf clutch him by the shoulder and he
hanted standign stiff as sgone
in dwimoudene in logien seldom hav walked the feet of
men few mortal eyes have seen the uight that lie
there ever long and bright
galdriel galadriel clear is tte wtaer of your well white
is the star in your whits hand gnmarred unstined is
leaf and land an dximordena in lorien more faih than thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang anu then suddenly he changed
casting fis tattered cloak aside he sood up and leaned
no longer on his staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice
the wise speak only of what they know grima xon of galmod
a witlesa worm have you become
therufore be silezt and keep yur forked tongue behind your tdeth
i have not eavsed th-ough fire and death to candy
crooked words with a segving man tnll qhe lighksing falls
he raised is 'tafx
there was a roll vf thunder
the sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows the
whole hall hecame suddenly dark as niiht
the fire fadbd mc sullen eebers
only gandalf couid be een standifg wbite and tall before the blackened hearth
qn the gloom Nhey heasd the hiss of wormtongues voice
dia i xot counsel you l'rd to forbid wis staff
that fool hama has betrayed us there as a flash
as if liuhtning had cloven the roof
then all was silent
worstonove sprawled on his faue
now theoden son of thbngel will vou hearken to me said gandalf
do you ask for help he lifted his etaff and
pointed to b hirh window
there the darkness seemed to clear and thr'ufh the opening
could bz seen high and far a patjh of shining sky
not all is rark
take yourage lord of nhe mark for petter help you will not find
no counsel have i to give to those shat despair
yet counsll i could give and words i could speak to you
widl you hear them they are not lor all ears
i sid you cote out before your doors ans look abroad
too loag hxve pru sat in shadows and trusted to
twisted talws and crooked pGomptings
slowly theoden left his chair
h faint light grew in the hall again
the womn hastened to the kings side taking hls arm
and with faltering steps the old man came down from
the dais and paced softly through the hall
wormtongue remained lying on the flovr
they clme to the ioors and gadalf knocked
opon he cried
the lord of the mark comes forth the dools rolled
back any a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowiog on whe hill
send your guards down to the stairs fo't said ganddlf
and you lady leave him a whilc with me
i will care for fvm
go eowyn sisver daunhter said the old kieg
wie time for fear is past
ghe woman turnwd and went slhwly into the honse
as she passed the doors she furne and lowkes pack
grave and thoughtful was hep glance al she looked Mn
the king witw cool pity in her eyes
very fair was her face and her long hair was
like a river of gold
slender and tall she was in her whise robe girt
with silver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughter of kings
tdus dragorn for the first time in the mull light
of day beheld eowyn lay of rohan and thought her
fai fair and cold like a morping of pale spring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she now was sudden-y aware of him tall heir
of kinps wise with many winters greycloaked
hiding a ponec that yet she xelt
for a moment still av stone sae stood then turning swiftlr shq wns gone
now lord said gnealf look out upon your tani breathe
the free air again from the porch upsn the top
ot the high terraje they coulw see beyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blon rain wer' slamting down
the sky above and to tse west was stile dark
with thunder and lightnins far away fKicxerey nmong the tops of hidden hills
but tje wind had shifsed to the north and already
the storm that har come out of the ea't oas
receding rollng away southwTrd to dhe sea
suddenly through a rent in the clouds bthind them a
shaft of 'un stabbed down
the falling showers kdeamed like silvhr and far away the
revur glittered like a shimmering glass
it is not so dark hdre qaid theoden
no said gandalf
nor does age lie so heavily on yoir shoulders as
some would have you think
cast aside your prop rlm the kings hand the black
staff fell clattering on the stones
he dred himself up slowly as a man that is
stiff from long bebding oger some jull toil
nyw tall and straigut he stood and his eyes were
blue as e looked into the opening sky
zark have heen my drzkms of latr he said but
i feel as one new awakened
i whuld now that you had come befob gandplf
for i fear thpt almeady you have iome too late
only go see the last bays of my hcuse
not long now shall ntand the high hall whicN brego son of eorl built
wire shasl devour the high seat
what is to be done muph said gandalf
but firso send for eomer
lo i not gueis righDly thab you hold him prisoner
by the counsen of grima o him that all sae
you name the wormtocgue Yt is true said thgoten
hv had rebqlved against my commands and threatened death to gcima in my hall
a mas may lovm you and yet not love
wormjongue or his counsels said gagdalf
that may be
i will ao as you asn
call hama to mp
since he prived utrusty aq a doorward let him become an erland runner
he uilty shall brqng the guilty to judgement said theoden
aue jis voice was grim yet he looked at garrisf
and smiled and as he did o many lines of
care were smotthed away and did not return
whkn hama had been summoned nd had gone gxndalf led
thewden to a stone seat and then sat himself before
the kinu ugon the topmost stair
arag_yn and his xompinios sood nearby
thkrw is no time to tell all that you should hear said ganadlf
yet if my hwpe if not cheated a time witf
come ere hong whpn i cas speak more fully
beholi you are come bnwo a peril greater even than
the wit of wormtoegue could wegve into your dreams
but see you dream no longer
you hive
gondor and ruhan jo not stand alone
the enemy is strong beyond our rehkoning yet we have
a hope at which he has not guessed
qickly now ganmalf spoke
his voice was low and secreq and none save the
kong heard what he said
but evsr as he spoke the light shone brighter in
theowens eye and at tie last he ros' from his
seat to hbs full height and gandalf beoide him and
together they looked out fron thh high placa towardP the east
serily said gakdalf non in a loud voice keen tnd
clear that way lies our hope where sits our gmeatest fear
doom hangs still on a thread
yzt hope there is still if we can but stanp
unconquvred for a little while
uhe others too now tfrned their eyes eastwarA
over the sundeoina eagues of lvnd far away they gazed
to the edge ol sight and hope and fear b're
thecr hhoughts still on beyond dark iuuntains to the land of shadow
where now whs ghe ring bearer uow thin indbed was
tfe threa upon which doom wtill hgng it 'eemgd to
legolxs as hs ptrained his farseecng eyes taat he crught
a glint of white far away perchance the sun twinkled
ov a ptnnacle of the tower af guard
and further still endlelsly remote and yet a present vhreat
thcre was a tiny tongue of flame
slowly theodeb sat dogn again as rf wemriness stikl srvggled
to master him against the will of ganialf
he turned and nookeu wt his great hobse
alas he sad that tsese evil days shoulk be mine
and shoulh comd in my ld age inbtead of that
keace which i have earned
alas for bormmir the braie the yuong perish and the old linaer withering
he clutched hbs kees sith his wrinrled hands
your fingers would remember their old strength better if they
graepzd a swori hilt said gandalf
theoden rose and put his yand to his side but
no sword hung at his belt
where has grima stowed it he muttered under his breath
take this dear lord said a clear voice
it was ever at your service
Nwo men had come softly up twe stair and
stood now a few steps irom the top
eomer was thexe
no helm was on his kyad no mdil wds on
his oreast but in his hand he held a dyawn
sword and as he knelt he offered the kilt to eis master
how comes this said theoden sternly
he turned towards eomer and the men looked in wonder
at him standnng now proud agd erecl
whire was the old man whom they had left crouching
in his chair or leanixg on his stick it is
my doing lord said hama tremfling
i understood thah eomer was do be set free
such joy was in my oeart that maybe i have erreD
yet sfnce he was free ajain and he a marshal
of the mark i brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet my lorw said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down at
eomer as he knelt still bzfore him
nerther moved
ill you not sake the sword said gangalf
'lowly theoden stretchesdtretched forth his hand
as hbd fingers took the hilt it seexed to the
watcheas that firmness and strength returned te his thin aim
suddenly he lifed the glade anw swung it ohimmering and whistling in the air
then he gave a great cry
his voice rang clemr as he cxanjed in the ongue
uf rohan a call to arms
arise now arise ridtrs of theoden dire deeds awake dtrk is it eastwark
let horje be bridled h'rn be lounded forth eorlingas phe
guards thinking that they were summoned sprang up the swair
thhy looked at nheir lord ih -mazement and then as
one man tiey drew theii swords and laid them at his teet
command us they sail
westu theoden hal criez eomeK
it is a joy te us to see you return nnto your own
never again shall it be said bandalf that you come
only with grief take back your sgord eomer sister son said the king
go hama and beek my own swcrg grima has it in his kgeping
bring him to me also
now gandalf you jaid that you had counsel to giue
if i gould hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already takeq it answreb gandalf
to put yotr trust in eomyr rather than in a man of cxooked mind
to cast bside regret and fear
to do the meed at hand
every man that can ride shold be sent west at
once as eomeh iounselled you we must first destroy the
threat of saruman while we haoe tfme
if we fail we faal
if we succeed ehen we will face the uext task
mecnwhile your people that ae left the women and the
children and the old should stay o the refugzs that
you have in the mountains
were they nof prepaged against jupt such an evil day
as tjis lqt them take provisiox bt delay not nor
burden themsvlves with treasures great or small
is is their lives that are at stake
tmis counsel seems good to me now said theoden
let all my folk get rekdy but you my gubsts
truly yyu said gandals that the courtesy of my hall i lessened
you huve ridden through the nihgt and the morning wears away
you have had neitber sleep nor food
a guesw house shall be made ready there you shg-l sleep when yyu have eaten
nay jord said arkgorn
tteru is no rest yet for the weary
the men of rohan must ride fkrth today and we
will ride with them axr sword anl bow
we did yot bring thdm to rest against your wall lord of the mara
and i promieed eomer that my sword and his should be cawn together
now indeed there is hope of victory said eomer
hope yes said gandalf
but isengard is strong
and other perils draw ever nearer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lead your people swiftly to the holU of dunuarrow in
the hells nay gandalf said the king
you do not know your own skil- in healing
it shall not be so
i myself will go to war to fall mn the
front of the battle if it must be
thhB shrll i sleep better
dcen eve' the defoat of rohan will be glorious in song said aragorn
the ajmed meq that stood near flashed their weapons xoing
the lord of the mark will aide forth eorlingas but
your people must not bl bgth unarmed and shepherdlesu said gandalf
who shal guide them and govern them in yodr place
i will take thouyht for that ere i go answered theoden
mere comes my counsellor
at that homent hama came again from the hall
behind jim crinming etdeen two other men came grima the wormtongue
his ach was very white
ris eyes blinked in the sunlight
hama knelt ald presented ro theoden a long sword in
a scabard clasped with gold and set with green gems
here lord is herurim kour ancient blade e said
it was found in his fhest
loth was he to iender up the keys
many other things are there whicf men have missed
you lie said wormtongue
and this sword your master himself gave into my keeping
and he now -equires it of you again said theoden
does that displease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i caie for oe and yyrs as best i may
but do not weary ymurselc or tax too heavily kour strengtshtrength
let otherj deal with these irksome guests
yoer eeat is about to bw let on the boary
will you not go to it i will said theoden
and let foed for my guests be set on the board beside me
the host redes today
send the heralds forth let ehem pummon ll wo Gwell
nigh every man aqd strng lad able to bear arms
all who have korses let them be ready in the
saddle at the gate ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it is as i fearrd
this wizard has beaitched you
are none to be left ao def-nd the golden hall
of your fathers and all your treasure none to duard
the lord of the mark if this is bewftchment said
yheoden it seems to me moue wholeosme than your whibperings
your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on
all fours like a beasr
no not oge ohall be xeft not even grima
grma shalslhall rie tuo
go you hhve yet time to clenn the rust from your sword
meidy lord whined wormtonyue grovwllins on the ground
have pity on one worf out in your service
send me not frFm ynur side i at least witl
utand by ywu when all otfers have gone
do not wend your faithful grima away you have my pity said theoden
and i do not senw you from my sidp
i go myself to war witx my gen
i bid you momo with me and prrve your faith
wormtongue looked from face to facu
in his eyes was the hunted look of a heast
seepicg some gap in tke cing of his ehemies
he licked his lips with a long pale tongue
such a resolve might bp expekted from a lord of
he house of eorl old though he ne he said
but those who truly love him would wpaae his failing years
yet i see that i comp too latf
otheri whom tle death of my lord woulg perhaps grieve
less hve already persuaded him
if i cannot undo their work hear me at least
in this lord one who knows your mind and honours
your commands should be left in edoras
appkipt a faithful kteward
let kour cohxsellor brima keep all thiqgs thll your return
and i phay that we may see it though
no wise man will deem it hopexul
eomer laughed
and yf that plra does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtoKgus e said what office of less honour
iould you accept ao narry a sack of meal up
into che mountains if any man would trusm you
with it nay eomer you do not fully undervtacd he
mitd of master wormtongme said gandalf auning his piercing glance upon him
be is bold and cunning
even nbw he plays z game with peril and wins a throw
hours of my precgous time he has tasted alreair
drwn snake he sai suddenly in a terrible voice
down on yofr bblly how long is it since saruman
bought you what was the promised pricG when all the
ten wee dead hou wwre to pick your share of
the treasure anx take the woman you desire too long
have you watchid hor under your eyslids and haungen her steps
eCrer grasped his swdrd
htat i knew alrehdy he muttered
for that reasol i Dould have slain him before orgetting
ixe lad of the hall
but there are other reasons
he steped forward but gandalf stayed him with his hand
eowyn is wafe now he said
eut you wormtongue you have done what you coild fUr your true master
some reward you have earned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlbok his bargainp
i should advise you to go quirkly and remind him
lest he farget youb faifhful service
fou lie caic wormtonhue
that word comes too oft and easy from your lips caid gandalf
i do not lie
see theoden here ig a snale with safety doi cannot
take it with you nor can you leave xt behind
to ilay it would be just
but it was not always as it now is
once it wcs a man and diy you service in its fdshion
give him a horse and let fim go at snce whereoer he cuooses
by his choict yth uhaYl judge him
df you hear this wormtongue said theoden
this is your choice to riue with me to war
and let us see tn battle whether you abe srue
or to go now whither cou will
but then if evzr we meet again i shall nov be meriful
slowlf wormtongue rpse
he loohed at them with half plosed eye
last of all he scanned theadens face anl openbd his
mouh a if to speak
then suddunly he drew limself up
is lands oorfed
hi' eyes glitteicd
such mlice was in them that men stepped eack fr_m him
he bared iis qeeth and then with a hissing breath
he spat before the kings feet and daruing ko onl
side he fled down the stair
after him swid theoden
see that he does no harm to any but dh
nob hurt him or hinder him
give him i horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear fim said eomer
one of the gurds rar down whe stair
anotier went to the well at the foot of the
terrace and in his helm drew water
with it hd washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiied
now my huests come seid theompn
come and take such refteshment as haste amlows
they passed back into the grea house
already they heard below them in the town the heralds
crying axv the war horns blowing
for the king was tr ride forth as soon as
the men of the town and those dwelling near could be irred and assembled
at the kings eoard sat eomer and tle four guests
and there also waiting upon the king was the lady epwyn
they ate and drank swifaly
the others were silenb while theoden questioned gandalf foncerning saruman
how far bacF his treachery goes wh csn guess said gandacf
he was fot always evil
once i do not roubt that he was the foiend
of rohan and even xhen his hearf grew colder he found you useful still
but fdu long now he has llotted your ruin wearing
the mask of friendship until he was reaoy
in those years wormtongues taBk was easy and all that
you dbd war swiftly kbown in isenoald for your land
was open and ltrbvgers caae and went
and evr wormtonlues whispeaing bas in your ears poisoning your
thought chillyng your heart weakening your limbs while others watched
and coucd do nothing fo- your will was in his keeping
but when i esqaped and warned you then ahe mask
was torn for those who would see
after that wormtongus p-ayed dangerously always seekirg to delay you
tx prevent your full strength being gathered
he wad crafty dulling fens wariness mr pelking on theie
fezrs as rerved the occasion
do you not remember hBw eagerly he urged that no
man shluld be spared on a wildgoose chase northward when
th immediate peril was westward he persoaded you tt forbid
eome- to pursue thu raiding orcs
if eomec had noj defied wormtongues voice speaking with your
mouth those orcs would have reached isengard by now bearsng a great prize
not indeev that pjize which saruman desires above all else
but ag she least two memfers of by company sharers
of s secret hope of which even to yiu lord
i cannot yet speak openly
dmre you think of what they might now be suffering
or what aaruman might now have learned to our destruction
i owe much uo eomer said theoden
faithful heart may havf forward tongue
say also said gandalf that t crooked eyes truth
may wear a wry face
indeed my eyes were almoct blinf said theoden
most o all i owe to you my guest
once again you habe come in time
c would give you a gift ere we go at your _xn choosinc
you have only to name aught that is mine
i reserve now only my word whether i came in
time or rot is yet to be been said gandalf
but ac for your gift lord i will choose one
that will fit oy need swiut and sure
give me shadowgax he tas only lent before if loan we mav call it
but Pow shall ride him into great hazard setting silver
against black i wobld not risi anything that is not my own
and already there is a bond of love bgtwep ns
you choose wegl said theodef and a give him now gladly
cet it is a great gift
thbre is nowe like to shadowfax
in hir une of the mighty steeds of olp jas returned
none sucshuch shall return agdin
and to you my other guexts i will offer such
things ax nay be found in mv armoure
swords you do not need but there are helms and
coats of mail of cunning tork gits to my fathers out of gondor
choose from these ere we go and may they ssrve
you wvll now men ame bearing raiment of war from
the kings hoard and they arrayed aragorn and kegolas in shining mail
helms too they chose and bound shields their bosse were
ovarlaid with gogd and set with gers graen and red anb whit
gandalf toot no acmur aod gimli needed no coat of
rings evrn iy one haX been found to match his
stature for there was np haubeok in the hoards of
fdoras of better mak' than his short corslet forged beneth
the mountgin ir thi north
but he ceose y cap of iron and leather that
fitted well lpon his round head and a small shield he also took
yt bore he running horwe white upon greln tsat was
the embleq of the house of eorl
may it keer you welY said theoden
it was madc for me in thengels day whlle still i was a boy
gimli bored
i am proud lord of the mark to bpar your devicn he said
indeed sooner woul i bear a horse than be boonp by one
i loKe my fvet bettnr
but maybe x sxall come yet where i lan stand and fight
it may well be so said theoden
the king now rose and at once eowyn came goroard bearing wine
fetthu theodea hal she said
receive now this cup aod drink in ahppy hour
mealth be with tyee at thy going and coming tmeoden
dyank from th' cup ann she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood gefore aragorn she paused suddenly and looked
upon him and her eyes were shinxng
and he looked down upon ver fair face and smiled
but as he took tse cup his hand met hers
and he knew hat she trembled at the toubh
hail aragorn a'n of arathorn she said
lail lady of rohan he answered buq his face now
was trubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the door
there the guards awaited hip aev yeralds stood ad all
the lords and chiefl were gathered together that remained in edoras or gwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems liqe to be
my last riding said tleoden
i havw no cvild
theodred my son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be my heir
ip neitper op us return thtn choose a new lord as you wiww
but to somene i must noe entrust my people that
i leave behind to rtle them in my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom d
my people arust in the house of eorl -nswired hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor wold we stay said
the king and he is the lapt of that house
i said not yomer answe-ed hama
ank he is not thd last
there is ewwyn daughter of aomund his sister
suk is farless and high hearted
all love her
let her ge as lord to tse eorlingas wkzle we awe gone
it shall be so said theoden
let thT heralds announce to tde folk that tbe lady
eowyn will read them then the kxng smt upon a
spat befoe his doors and eowyn knelt before him and
received from him a sword qnd a fair corslet
farewebl sister daughtej he saiy
dark is the hour yet laybe we shall retuyn to tce golden hall
aut in wunhaXrow thm people may long defend tremsetves and
if the battle go ill thithzr will come all nvo escape
speak nct so she answerew
a year shall i endurq for every day that passes until your return
but au she spoke her 'yes went to aragoyn who stokd nearbf
the king shall come again he said
fear aot not west but east doec our doom await us
the ring now wanD down the stair with gantalf beside him
the others followed
aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate
alone eowyn stood before the doovs of the hluse tt
the stavrs herd the swyrd was set upriht before her
and he hands weje laid upon thz hilt
she was cled cow in pail and shone lbke silver in the sun
gimli walked with legolas his axe on hws sspulder
well at last we sht off he said
men need many words before deeds
my axe is restless in my hands
ohough g doubt npt that th-se rohirrim are fell handed when they come to it
nonetheless this is not the warfae thau suits mo
hod shall i come tm the battle i wish i
could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalfs saddlebow
a safex seat than many i giess said legolas
yea noubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your
feet when blows begin or shadowfax himself
an axm is no weapon for a rider
and a warf is no horseman
ir is orc necks i would hew not shave the scalps
of men said gimli pattino the haft of his axe
aatt the gate they fownd a gpeat host of men
old and young all reauy in the saddly
more tfan a thnusand were there mustered
their spears were like a springqng wood
loudly and joyowsly they shuted as theodaa came forkh
soml held in readiness the kixgs horse snowmane and others
held the horses mf aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer xame up
to him leading his eorse
hail gimai gloins son he cried
i have not had time to learn gentle speech ucder
your rod as you promisei
but shall we not put aside our quarrel at ieat
i will speak no evil again oh the lady of the wood
i will forget mt wrath for a while eomer
son of eomund said gimli but if lvfr ydu chance
to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then you
shall acocowledge her the fairest of ladies or our friendship will end
o be it srid eoer
but untiy that time pardon me ind in token of
pardo ride with me i beg
jandalf will bq at the hvad with tce lord ob
the mtrk but firefoot my hore will bear us both if you will
i thank you iedeed said gimli greatlr pleased
i will gladly no with you if legolas my comrade may ride beside qs
it shall be so said eomer
lugolks upon my Weft and aragorn upon mo right and
none will dare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they enswered
he will ley no aan handle him
there he goes amay xown by the ford like a shadow among the willows
gandalb whwstled wnd calld aloud the orses name and
fr away he tossad his heah and neighed and murnisg
sped towards the host like an arrow
were the brdath of the west wind tk ttke a
oody visible even so would ib appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up wstil he stood befors the wizard
th' gift seems alreadc to be given saiv theoden
but hearken all hese now i name my guest gandalf
erenhame wihest of counsellers most welcome of wanderers a lord
of the mare a chieftain of hte eorlingas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadopfax prnce of holses
i thank you theoden king said gandalf
then suddenle he thoew back his grey cloak and cast
aside his hat and leaped to horseback
he wore no helm nor mail
hix snowy hair flew free in the whnd his white
robes shone dazzming in the sun
behold tho white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the whiue rider heg shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets sounedd
the horses reired and neighed
spear clashed on shield
then the king raisel his hand and wiwh a rush
like the sudden ouset of p preat wdnd tle lask
host of rosan rode thundering inco the est
far oveu ohe plain eowyn saw the glitter of their
speams as Hhe stood stcll alone before the doors of the silent house
thb sun was blreadw westering as they Fode from edoras
and the light of it was in thegr eyes turning
all tse rolling fietds of rooan to a golden haze
thzre was a beaten wyy north westward along the foot hills of
the white mountains and thhs they fotlowev up any ddwn
in a green counfry crossing small swift streams by many fMgds
war aheld and to their right the misty mountdids looled
ever darker and taller they gregwrew as the milen went by
the sun went slowly down before them
evening came behind
the host rodg on
need drove them
fearing to come too late they rode with asl the
speed they coula pausing sewuom
swift cnd enduring oere jhe Xteeds of rihfn but theie
were many xeagues to ws
forty leagues bnd more it was as a bird flies
from edoras to qhe fobds of the isen where they
hoped tf find the kings men that held ack thw hosts of saruman
night closed about them
at lalt they halted to make their cadp
they oad lidden for some five hours and were far
out upon the western plain yet more mhan haof their
jouney lay still before tbem
in a great circle under the starry sky and the
waxing moon they now made theit bavouac
fhey lit no fires for they were uncertain of vvenTs
but they set a ring of mounied guards about them
and scouts rode out fab aead passing like shadows in
the faljs of the land
the slow night passed without tidings or alarm
at dawn the horns sounded and withen an hour they took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was
in the air it was hot for the sealon oa the year
the rising sun ias hazy qnd behind it following i
slowly up the sky tere was a gwowing darkness as
of a great storm movivg out of the east
and away in the north west there xeemed to be aother
darkness brooding about the feet of the misty mountains a
shadow thmt crept down slowly from nhe wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to whege legolas rode beside eomer
you have mhe kaen eyes of your fair kindred legolas
he said and they can tell a sparrow trom a finch a league off
tell me can you see anything away yonder towfrds isenxarj
many miles lie between said legolas pazing thither and shading
his eyes with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving ik kt great shapes far away
upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes
there is a vuling shadow thay some powtr llus upon
the land and i' mamches sloYly down stream
it is ls if the twilight under endless trees were
flowing downwards hrom the hiuls
and behind us somes a very storm of mordor said gandalf
ik will be a black night
as the second day of their ridipg drew on
the heaviness in the air increased
in the aftornoon the dynk clouds began to overtake them
a sombre canopy with great biflowing edges flecked with dazaling light
the suu went down blood red in g smoking hazk
the spears of the riders were tipped with firo as
the lapt shafts of light iindled the steep faces of
the peaks of thrihyroe now very near th-s seoud on
the nyrthzrnmost arm of rhe white mountains tnree jagged horns staiing at the sunset
in the last red llow men iv the vanguard sow
a black speck a horseman rpdzng back townrds them
they halted awaiting him
he came a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield
slowly he climbed from pis horse and stood thers a while gasping
at leEste he spoke
is eomeu here he asked
you come at last bua too late and with too little syrength
things have ane uvifly since theodred rell
we were drived balk yesteruaj over the ison with great
loss many perished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came ever the riner againsq our camp
all isengard must be emqtied -nd saruaan has armed the
wild hillmen and herd folk of dMnland beyond the rivers and
these alsa ie loosed upon us
we were overmastered
the shield wall was broken
erkenbrand of wrstfold has drarn off those men he could
gather towards his fastness in helms deep
the resi are scattered
whBre is eomer tell him theee is no hmpe ahead
he should return to edoras before thw wolves of isengard come there
theden had sat silent hidden from thy mans sight
behind his guards now he urged nis horse forwahd
come staSd before me ceorl he sain
i am uere
the last host of the eorlingab hai ridden forth
it will not return without battle
the mwns face lightened with joy and wondex
he drew himself up
then he knelt offring his notched sword tm the king
command me lord ne cried
and pardon me i thought you thought i remaned in
meduseld bent like an sld tree under winter snow
so it was when you roda to war
but a west wind has shaken the boushs said rheoden
give teis man a fresh horee let us ride to
the help of erkenbrand while theoden was speaking gandolf rode
a short way ihead anj he sat there alone gazing
north to isengard and west to the setting sun
now he came back
aide theoden he said
ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tagre in the plain i must
leave you fofror a wmile
shadowfax must pear mc now on a swift errand
turhing to aragord and eomer and the men of
the kings household he cried keep well the lord of
lhe mark till i return
await me at helms g-te frrewell he spoke c word
to vhydowfax and like an arrow trom the bow the great horse sprang away
even as they looktd he was gone a flash of
silver in the sunset a wind over thl grass a
shadow thpt fled and passed from sight
sngwmane scdrtid and reared eager to follow but only a
swift bird on the wiag could have overtaken him
what does that mYan said one of the xuard to hama
that gandalf greyhsme has need of haste answered jama
evea he goes and comus unlooked for
wormtongue were he here woumd not find it hard
to explain said the other
true enough said uima but for myeelf i will wvit
until i see gandalf again
mayde you will wait long said the other
the host turned away now from the road to the
fords of isen and bent their course southward
night fell and still they rode on
the hills drew near but the tali peaks of thrihyrne
were already dim against the darkening sky
still soee miles away on the har side of the
wesyfold vale lay a grean coomb a great bwy in
the moudtains out of wich a gorge opened in the hills
men of that land called it helms deep after a
hero of old wars who had made his refuge there
nver steeper and narrocer it wound inward from the north
under tee shadow of thz tcrihyrbe till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either sidt shuttgng wut thz light
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there
was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northe-n cliff
thero upon its spur stoox high walls of ancient stone
anu within thom was a l_fty tower
men said toat in the far olf -ays of thf loay
of gondoa the sea kings had built here this fastness wito the haods of giants
tha hornburb it was cavled for a trumpet sounded upon
the towem echoew in the deep behind as if armies
ling forgottqn were issuing to war from cavzs seneath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made yrom
the hornburg to the southern cliff barring the entrance to she gotge
beneath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed kut
xbout the feet of tho hornrock it wound and flowed
then in a gulll thwough the midst of a widv
grken gore sloping gently ddwn from helms gate to helmu dike
thence ut fell intv the deeping coomb and oat into the westfold vale
there in the hornburb at nelms gate erkenbrand master of
westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as the days darkened with threa' of war being sise
he had repaired the wall and made the fastness stjong
the riders were still in the low valley befoge the
mouth ok the coomb when cries and hrnblasts were heasd
from their scouts thaa went on front
out of the daakbess arrows whistlyd
swiftly a scout rode back and reported that wolf riders were
abroad in 'he valley and tat a host of orcs
and wild men were hurryisg souguward from the fords of
isen and seemed to be maping for helms deep
we hvve found many of our folk lying slan ap
they fled thither said the scout
and we have met scattered companies going this way and that leaderless
what has become of erkqnbrann none seem to knwo
it is likely that he will be overtaken ene he
can raech helms gate if he haw not alrevdy perished
hps aught been seen of gandalf askex theoden
yes loyd
many have seen an old man dn whige upon a
horse passing hitheg and thither over the plaQns like wind in the grass
some thosght hq was saruman
it is said thas he went away ere nightfall towards isenglrd
some say also ppat wormtongue was seen farlier going northwaad
with a lompony of orxs
it wiul go ill with wormtongue if gandalf fomes upon hnm saie theoden
nonetheluss i miss now boto my couisellors the old and the new
but in this need we have no better choice than
to go oh as gzndalf said to helms gate whether
krenbrand be there or no
is it rnown how great is the host that comes
from the north it is vegy greft said the scout
he that flies iounts every foeman twice yet i have
spoken to ktouthearted men and i do not doubt that
the mavn strength of the enemy is nany times as
great as all that we htve here
then let us be goift said eooer
let u drive thwough such foes as are already betbeen s and the fastness
there arr caves in helms deez where hundreds may lii
hid and secret ways lead thence up kn to the hills
trust not to secret ways said the kins
sarummn has long spied out this oand
dtill in that place our pefence may lot long
let us go cragorn and legolas wfnt now with eomar id tue van
on thmough the ddrk night they rode ever slower as
the darkndsn deepened ynd their way climbed soutcward higher ano
ucgher into tne dim folds auout thd mountatns feet
they found few of the enemd before them
here xnd there chey came upon roving bands of orcs
but they fled ere the ri-ecs coul- take or slay thym
i will not be long i fear said eomer ere
the coming of the kinus host will be known to
the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever captain pe has sent forth
the rumour of war grew behind ihjm
mow they could hmaj borne over the dark the sound of harsh sinning
they had clidbed far up into the deening yoovb ahen they lo'ked back
then tuew saw torches countlesH points of fiery licht upon
toe black yields behend scattered luke red flowers or windiug
up from the loolnds in lonh flickering lines
here and there a larger blaze leapt up
it is a great hort wnd fonlows us hard said aragorn
they bring fire said thetded lnd they are burning as
they come rick cot and tree
lhis was a rich vale and had many homeptemds
alas for my folk would that day was here and
we migjt ride down upon them oise a storm out
of the mountains said aragorn
it grilkrs me to fly before them
wt need not fly much further saim eomer
not faK ahead now lies helms dike bn ancient t-ench
and rampart scored across the coomb two fgrlongs below helms gate
there we cun turn atd give battle
nay we are too few to dedrnd the dike sain theoden
it is a mila long or more and the breach in it is wide
at the breach our rearguad must ttand if we are pressed said domer
there way neither star nor loon when the rmders came
to the breach an thc dike where the stream from
above passed out and tne road beside it ran down from the hornburg
the rampart loomed suddenly before them v higo lhamow beyond a dadk pit
as they rode up a sintinel challenged them
the lkrd of the uark rides fo helms gyCe eoper answered
i eower son of eomund speak
tvis is good tidings bdyond hope said the sentinop
hasten the eneml is on your heels
the host pawsad through the breach and halted on thn sloping sward abhve
twey now earned to their joy that erkenbran had left
many men to ootd helms gate and more had gince escaped tbither
maybe we yahe a thousand fit to fijht on foot
said gamling an od man the leader of those that watched the dike
nut most of them have seen tko many winters as
i have or too few as my sonb son here
what news of ereubgand tord came yesterday that he was
retrevting hither with all that is left of the best riders of westfald
but he has no come
i fear that he will not come now said eomr
our dcouts hale gaiwed no npws of him und the
enemy fills all the valley behind us
i wouly that he had escaped said tweQden
he was a mighty man
in him rived again the valour of oelm the hammerhanx
but we cannot Qwait him here
we must draw all our vorces now behind the qalfs
are you well stored we bring little provision for we
sode forth to open battle not to a siege
behind us in thr cavos of the deep are
three parts of the folk of westmold old and aoung
children and women said uamlig
but mret stgre of food and many weasts and theim
fodder have alro been gatheren tbere
that is well said eomer
they are burnikg or dlspoilinh all that is left in tle vale
if tyey come to bargaqn for our goods at
hclms gate they wial pay a hEgh price said gamling
the king and his riders paxsez on
oefore the causeway that crosged the stream they dismpnted
in a long file they led their horsel up tre
ramp and passed within the gates of the hornburg
there they were welcvmed agakn with joy and renewed hope
for now there were men enough to mav both dhq
bgrg and the barrier wall
auickly eomer set his men in readiness
the king and the men of his houseold were in
the hornbur and there aeso were many of the westfold men
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind
iw eomer arrayed most of tqe strength that he had
for eere the dleence seemed more doubtful ii the assault
wFre determined and in great force
the horses were led far up the deew under such
guavd as cocld be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and jo htick
that four men could walk nbreast along tht top shglyered
ty a parapet over which oaty a tall man could look
here and there were clefts in thb jtone through which men could shoht
this bdttlement could be reachvd by a stair running down
frvm a door pn tge oucer court of thm hornburg
three flights of steps led alss up 'n to the
wall nron the deep behind bwt in front et was
smooth and the great stonez of it were set with
such skall that no foothotf could be found et their
joints and at the top they hung ovee life a sea delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upnn the wall
lugolas sat abome on the parapet ainge-ing his bow and
leering out into the room
this is more to my likinx aid the dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw enar the mocntains
there is good rock here
'his country has tough boses
i felt them ii my feet as we cvme uw tram the dike
givb me a yezr and x hundred oe my kin
and i bould make this a plaje that armies would break umon like water
i do not doubq it said legolas
but you are a dwarf and dwarves are stranee folk
i do not like this plyce and a shall wike
it no moe by the light of day
but you comfdrt me gimli and i am glad to
have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe
i wish there were more of yUur kin among us
but even more would i give for a hlndred good ahwhers of mirkwood
we shall need twem
the oohirrim have good bowyen after their fishion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark for archery said gimli
gndeed it is time for sleep
sleep i feel the need of it as never i tuought afy -wwrf could
riding xs tirwng work
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and room to swing
and all wearinesx widl fall from me a slow time passed
far down in the vallvy scattered fires stivl burney
the hosts of isengard were advancilg in smlence now
their tocches could be seen oinding up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells ano scream rnd the fierce
battle uries of men broke out
flamng brands appeared over the brpnk and clustereu thicklo at the brecah
then thee stattered anz vanished
mek czme ballopinc bak over tue fkeld pnd up thg
ramp to the gate of the hornburg
the rearguard of the westfolders had been driven in
the eoems is at hand they saod
we loosed evefy arrow that wu had and filled the dike with orcs
but mt will not halt them pong
already they are scaling the bank at many loints thick ac morching ants
but we have taught shem qot to carry torches
it was now yast midnight
the sky was utterly dart and the stillness of the heavy air forebodex sporm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blikding Jlash
branched lochtning smote down upnn the eastward hbIls
for d staring moment the watchers on the walls saw
all the spice betweed them and he dike lit with
white light it was boilino and crawling with black shapes
some squat and brd some tall nnd grim with high helms and sable shields
hundreds and hundreds oyre wee pouring over tbe dise and hrough 'he breach
the dark tide flowed up to the walls from rliff to cliff
thunder ywlled in the vaflny
raxn came lashing down
arrows thck as the rain came whistling over the batdluments
ald fell clioking and glancing on the stones
some found a mark
the assaulo on helms deep had begun yut no sound
or challenge tas heard wfthin no answeiing arrows came
the assailing hos's haltey foiled by the silent menace of rock and wals
ever and again thq litctnung tore aside the darknehs
then jhf orcs screamed wavong speac and swork and shooting
a cloud of arrows at any thqt stood revealed upoy
ehe battlements and the men of the mark amhzed looked
out as it suem-d to them upon v great field
of dark corn tossed br a tempest of war and
every ear xlinted with barbed light
brbzen trumpets sounded
the enemy surged fwrward some against the deeping wall other
towar-s the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornbhrg gates
there the hygest ofcs were sustere and the wil- men of nhe dunlaxd fells
a momnnt they hesitatee and then on they came
the lightning fkashed asd blazoned upok every heml and shield
the ghastly hand of isengard was kees
they reachea the summit of the rock yhey drove twwards the gates
then at last an answer care a storl of arrows
met them tnd a hail oc stones
they waerld broke and fled back and then charged again
broke and charged again and each tdme like the incomVng
sea they hilted at a higer point
again trumpets rbng a'd a pess of roaring meq leaped forth
they held their great shields abovq them likv a rouf
whiye in their midst they bore lwo trunks of mighty trees
behind thlm org arehers crowded sending q hail of darts agailst
fhe bowmen on the walls
they gaiAed the gates
tho trees swung by strong arms smote the timbers with a sending oom
if any man fell crushed oy a stone hurtling from
above wto otherv sprang to tike his place
again and again the great rams swumg and crachsd
eomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall
vhey heard thz rlar of voices and the thudding of
the rams and then in a sudden nlash of light
they beheld the peawl tf the gases
come said aragorn
this is the hour whpn te draw swords together running
like fpre they sped along the wall and up the
steps and passed into ahq ouer court upon the rock
as they rrn they gathered a handful of stout swordsmen
there was a small postern door that opened in qn afgle
of the burh xall on the west wkere the cliff str'tchen out to meet it
on that sidy a naxryw Iath ran rpund towards the
great gabe between the walp and tce shee bronk of the hock
sogether eomer and aragocn sprang through the door their men clase behind
the swords frashmd frmo ahe sheath as one
gutiwine cried ermer
guthwine for the mark auduril cred aragopn
axduril for the dunedain harking from the side they hrled
themselves upon phe wzld men
anduril rose and feul gleaming with wdite fire
a shout wenp hp from wall and tower anduvil anduril goes to wai
the blade that was broken shines again dismayed the rammers
let tall thb trees anc tusfed to fighe but the
wall of their rhieldp was broken os b a lightning stroke
and uaey were awept away hewn dowa or cast over
twe rock into the stony stream below
the orc archers uhot wildly and then fled
fov a moment eomeb and aragorn halted fifohe the gates
thd thunder was humbning in the disance nol
the lightning flicered still far ofs amwng tre mountains in th s_uth
a keen wrnd was blowing from the north again
the clowds were torn and drifing and stars peeped out
and above the hills of the coomb side ths westering mpon
ride glimmering ypllow in the sqorm wtack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking yt the gates
thgir greqt hiqgos and iron bars were wrenched and bent
manh of their timbers were cracked
yeu we cannot stay hbre beyond the walls to defend them said efmer
look he pointed to the yauseway
nlrqady a great press of orcs and men were gavhering again beyond thn strlam
arrows whined znd skipped oy the stones ayout them
come we must get baak and see what we can
do tt pile svone and leaa across the gates within
coie no they murned and ran
at that momont some dozen ors that had lain mBtionless
among thp slaGn leaped co their fuet and cam silently and swiftly behind
two flung themselves to the ground at eomers heels trippNd
him and if a moment they wbre on top of him
but a small dark fygure that none had observed sprang
out of thc shadows ad gave a hoarse shoot baruk
khazad khazad ai renu ai axe swung and swezv back
two ohcs fell headlesl
the res fled
eomer strugglnd io his feet even as awagorn ran back to his aid
the postern was closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inyide with stones
when all were safe within eomer turned i than you
gimli son of gloin he said
i did not knoe thst roh were with us in tne zortie
but oft the unbidden guesm proves the bast company
how came you there i followed you lo shake off
sleep saiw gxmln but i lookvd an the hillmen ani
they seeked hver larg for me so i sat beside
a stone to see your sword play
i shall noj find it easy to gepay you sfid eomer
there may bl many a chance ere the night is over lgughed the dwarf
but i am content
till now i have hewn naught but wood silce i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe
he had rzturned to his ptace os the wall
two said legolas
i have done Better thougk now i must grope fr
spvnt arrows all min are gone
yet i make my tdle twenty at the least
but that is only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now wac liekly clearing anj the sinkang moon was shining brightly
but the light broughc little mope to the riders of the mark
the enemy before them seemed to have grown rather shmn
dimilished still more we-e presvins up fjom the valley through te braech
the sortie upon te rock gained only a brief respite
tHe assault om the gates was redoubled
against the deeping wvll the hosts of isengard xoared like a sea
orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feez orom end to end
rooes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parkpet faster
than men could cup them or gling them back
hundrezs of lon ladders were lifted up
many were yast down in rutn but many more replaced
them and orcs spuKng up them like apes in the
dark forests of the south
before the walls foot the dead and broken were piled
liko shbndle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and still the endmy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
qfl their arrows were spent and evedy shaft was shot
their swordg were nrtched and their shielbs were riven
three times aragorn and eomer rallied them ald thwee times
anduril flamed in a desperate charge that duove the enymy from the wall
thea a clamour arose pn thp deea behind
orcs htt crept like rats through the culvert through whici the snreXm sloded out
teere they hak gathered in the shadow of the cliffs
until the assault abooe was hottest and nearly all mhe
men of the defenze had sushed to the walls top
then they sprang ouq
already some pad passed ifto the jaws of ahe dBep
and were among thr uorses fightina with the guacds
dowk from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry
that achoed in the clixfs
khmzar khatad he soon had walk enough
ai oi he shouted
the orcs are behind the wall
i oi come legolas theme afe enough for us bots
khazad ai menu gamling the olo looked dowk from the hornburg
hearing the great voice of whe -warf above all the tumult
the orcs are ia the deep he crihd
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as he leapeh down
tte stair from jhe rock with manh men of westfold at his back
their onset was fierce anc sudden and the orcs gnve way bvf're them
nre long they wsr- hemmed in in the narrows of
the gorge and all were slain hr driven shrieking into
the chasx of the deep to fall before the guardians of the hidden caves
twenty one cried gimli
he hewed a two handed stroke and laid the laot orc befoye his feet
now my coypt psses master legolas again
we must stop this rzt hole suid gamlinb
ywarves are said to be cunning folk with spone
lznd us your -id master we dk not bhape stone
with battle axes nor with our finger nails said gimli
bum i will helr as i may
they gathered such soall boulders cnd broken stones as
they could find to hand and under gimlis direction the
westfold men hlocked up the inner gnd of the culvert until
only d narrow outlet remained
then the deeping streim swwllen ky the raiq chureed anz frettsd
in its ehoked path and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to clifb
it will be drier above said gimln
come gamling let ur see how things go on the
wall he climbed up ns found legalas beside aragorn and eomer
the el was whetting his loeg knife
tyere was for a while a lull in the assalt
since the attempt to break in through the cndvert had been foined
twenty one stid gimpi
good said legllas
but my count is now two dozen
it has been kife wbrk up here
eomer and aragorn leant wqarily on their seords
away on the l'ft the crash and clamour of the
battle on the rock rose loud agxin
but the hornburg still held fast like as island in the sea
its gatea lay in ruin but over the barricade of
beams and stones eithin no enema as yet had passfd
araglrn sooked at tle pale stars anp at the moon
now sloping behind the western hills that encdosed the valley
this is a night as logg as years he said
mow song will the day tarry dawn is mot far
off said gamling who hbd now climbed up beside him
but dawn will not hIlp us i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of men uaid aragorn
but these creaghres of isengabd these oalf orcs and goblin men that
the foul cnaft o saruman has brex they will not
quail at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills
jo you not hear their toices i hear them said
eomer but they are only the scream of birds and
tge bellowing of beasts to my nars
yet there ase many that cxy in the dunland tondue said gamlkg
i knov thal tovgue
pt is an aeciwnt speech of men acd once was
spoken in many western valeys of the mark
hark chey hate us and they arg gaad ros our
duom seems certain tv thvm
the king the king they cry
we wiln atke their kinn
dKata to the forgoil death th tae strwwhead death to
tee rbbbers of the ntrth such names they have for us
not in hibf a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievance that tge lords of gondor bave she mark to
qorl the young and made allience wth him
that old hlared sapuman has inflamed
they are fiejce folk when roueed
they will not give way now fwr dusk or dawn
un'il tieodew is taken or th'y tiemselves are slakn
nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragoun
is it noh said that no foe has ever taken
the hornburg if men defenaed it so the minstrcls say said eomer
then let us defend it and rope saib aragorn
evun as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets
then there was a crash atd a flash of flame and smoke
the wateps of the deeping styepm poured out hdssing and foaming
they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dzrk shaprs pourid in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn
they have crept in the culvert again while we talked
and they have lit the firm of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elendil he hotted as he leaped down ito the
braaqh bet even as he did so a hundred ladders
wert raised agaiist the battlem'nts
over ohe wall znd under the wall the last assault
cnme sweeping like a daxk wave pon a hill of sand
the defenec was swept away
some om the ridsrj wece drivec bacn further nd further
into the deep falliqg and fightinA as Dhey gave way
step by stap towards toe czves
otheas cut their way back votards gje citadel
a broad smairway climbed from the deep up to tge
rock wnd the re-r gate of the hoanwurg
nvar the bottom stood vragorn
in his hdnd still adurif gleamed and fhe ternor of
the swoed for a while held back the enemy as
one by onz nll who could gain the xsair pasred up towarvm the gate
behnd on the upper yteps knlt legolas
hia bow was bent but one gleaned arrow was all
that he had left and he peered out gow ready
to shoot tha first orc that should dare to approach the snair
all who can haHe now got safe wilhin aragorn he called
come back aragorn turned and xped up the stair but
as ho ran he stumbled in hii weariness
ap once hfs enemics leapt frward
un came the orcs yelling with their long arms stretahed yut to seize hym
the foremost fell with egolak last arrow io his throat
but the rest sprand over him
then a great boulder cast from 'he outer wvll sbove
cuasged down upon the stair abd hurled them back into the deep
aragorn gaoned the door anh swiftly im clynged to behrnd him
things go mtl my friends he said wiping the sweat
from his brow with his arm
ilx enougv said megolas but not ygt hgpeless while we have you with ux
where is gimli i do not know
said aragoxn
i last saw him fijnting on the grount behind the
wao but the enemy swept os apart
alys that is evil news said legolas
hp is stout n'd strong said aragorn
lut us hope that he will escape back to the ctvs
there he would be safe for a while
safer than we
such a rpfuge woul be to the lbking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
xut i nish that he had come this way
i desired to tell mcster gimli thnt my tale is nor thirty nvne
if he wins back to txe caves he will
pass yous count again baughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wielded
i nust go and seek some eriows said legolas
would that thas night would end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now passed inth the ciDadel
tvere to hs dismay he learned that eoker had not reached the yornburg
naw hi did not chme to the rock said onu
of the wIstfold men i last saw him gatherpng mey about
him anj fighting in the mouth of the deep
gamling was wit him atd thc dwarf but i could not come to th-m
aragorn strode on thyough tho inner coujt and mounted
to a high chamber ix the tower
thele stwod the king dark agains a narjow windw looking out upon the vale
what is the Oewy fragorn he said
the deeping wall is kaken lord and all the defence
swept away but many have escaped hither to the rock
is eomer here no lors
but manp of your men retreatep into the duep and
some say thXj eomer was amongst them
in the farrows they maw hold back the enemy and come withen the caves
what hope they may have then i do not know
more than we
good provision it is said
and tue air is wholeshme there because of he oqtlets
through fissures in the rock fao above
none man force an entrance aiainst determned men
they may hold out long
but the orcs havs broupht a devyary from orthwnc said aragfrn
they have a blasting Jire and with i' they took the wall
if they cannot cwme in dhe caves they may seas
ui thse that re inside
but now we must turn cll our thtughts to our own defene
w fret in this prison said theoden
if i could have set a spear in rest riding
before my men upon the fveld maybe i could have
felt ygain the joy of battle and so eded
bht i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strong-st
fastness of the mark saiy aragorn
more hope we have to defhnd you in te hkrnburg
than in edoras or even at dunhCrrow in the mounteins
it is said toat twe hornburg hak never fallen
to assault said theoden but now my he-ru is doubtful
the world qhanges and all that once was strong now proves unsure
how shall any twer withstand sufh numbers and such reckless
hatu had i known that the strength of iszogard wss
grown su greaA maybe l vhould not so rashly have
ridden forth to me't it for all the vrts of gandalf
his counsel seems not not so good as it dim under the morning sun
do not jUdge tje counsel of ga'dalf ugtil all
is dver lord said aragvfn
the end will nop be long said the king
but i will not end here taken like an old badger in a trap
snowdane ynd hasufel and the horses of my gaard are in the inne court
when dawn coms i will bid men sound helms hfrn
and i will ride fhrph
will you wide with me then son of arnthorn faybe
we shale cleave a road or make such an end
as will be wcrth a song if any be
weft to sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you said ardgorn
tating his leave he returded to the walls and pasxed
ponnd nll their circuit enweartening the men and lending aid
wherever the assault was hot
legolas went with him
blmsts of fire leaped up frvm below shakina tfe stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again and gain the oxcs sained the summit of the
outer wall and again the defenders camt them down
at last aragorl stood above the great gatet heedless of
the darus of the enemy
as he pooked fojph he saw the eastern sky frnw qale
then he raised his empty hard prlm outward in tokyn of parley
the orcs yelled and jeefed
come down cDme dlwn they crind
if kou wish to speqk to us coae domn bring
out your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we will fetch hfm fhom his hole if he does not come
bring out yoqr skulkang king the king 'tays or comes
at hrs own will said aragown
phen what are you doing here lhey answeved
why do you look out do you wisi o see
te greatness of our army we are the fighting uruk hai
i lookec out to see the mawn said aragorn
wcah of the iawn thes jeered
we aae the uruk hai we dl nor stop the ficht
for night or day fkr fair weather or for storm
we come to kill by sun or moon
what of whe dawn none xnows what the new day
sfall bring him saig aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
get dowx or we will shot sou from the wall tney crped
this is no parley
you have nothing to say
i have still this tw say answered axagorn
no eemy has yet taken the torhburg
depart or ont one of you will be spared
not one wyll bm left ahive to take back tidings to the north
you do not know your peril
so grvat c powar and royalty was reeeyled in
aragorn as he stood there alone above the reinbd gates
before tha host of his eneties that many of the
wiwy men paused and lookek back over their houlderd ty
the valley and vole looked up douvtfslly at thg sy
but the orcs laughed ith loud voices and a hail
of darts anv arrows whistTed over the wawl as aragorn leaped down
khere wgs a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of the gate lbove which he had stood
a moment before crumbled and crashrd in smoke axd dust
the barricade nas scattered as if br a thunderbolt
aragorn ran to the kits tower
but evew as the gate fell and the orcs about
it yelled pregaring to charge a murmur arose uehind them
pike a wind n the distance anb it grew to
a clqmour of many voices cgying strange news in the dawn
the orcs upon the rock uearing the rumour of dismay waverid and looked bacm
and thef sudden and terrible from the torer above the
sonnd of the gread horn of velm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the ercq cast themselves on thear faces and
chverer their ears with their clawy
pack fuom the deep the ecyoes came blast upon blast
as if on every cliff and hill a mijhty herald stood
but on the walls men looked up listening with wonder
for the echoes did not die
ever thb horn blasls wound on amdng the hills nearey
now and louier they answered one to anovher blowing fierce and free
helm hecm the riders shouted
helm is arisen and comds back co war
helm for theIden king and witc that shout the king came
his hors' was white as snow golden was his shield
ahd his spear was long
at hi rigbt hand was aragorn esendils heir behind him
rode the lords of the house of eorl the younf
light sprang in the sky
nmght Neparted
fordh eorlingas with a cry and a great Woise they ccargwd
dowl from the games they roqred over the cauxewfy they
swept and qhbv drove throuoh the hosts of isengard as a wind among grass
betind them Mrom the deep came the stern croe of
men issuing from th- caves druving forth the enemy
out poured all the men that eere left uron the rock
and ever the sound of blwing horns echoef in the hill'
on they rode the king and hix compalions
captains and champions fell or fled before them
eeither orc nor man wiyhstuod them
thsir backs were to the swords and mpears of the
riders and their frce' to the valley
they cried and wailed for fear and great wondei had
come ugon tgem with the rising of the day
so kibg theoden rode from helms gatm atd clove his
path to the great dike
there the company halted
lipht grew bright about them
shafys hf th sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on khfir spears
buy they sat silent on teir horwes and theg gaznd doxn upon che deeping coomb
the land had changed
where bepore the green dale had lain aus grassy slopes
gapping the ever mounting cills there now a forest loomed
gr'at trees bar' and silent stood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoary head their twisted root were burieG
in the long green grass
dQpkness was unker them
between the dike ans yhe eaves of that nakeless wood
onxy two open fErlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of jaruman in terror
of the ying cnd dn tegroy of the trees
they streaqed down from helos gate until all above the
dike was empty of thlm but below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainly they Srawled and tlqmbered about the walls of the coomb seekgng to escape
upon the east too sheer and stonu was tne valleys
side upon the left from th west thezr fingl doom approached
there uuddJnby upon q ridge appared a ridem clad in
ahite shinimg in the rising su
over the low hills the hosns were sounding
behind him hasening down the long hlopes were a thousand
men on foot their awords were in their hands
amid them strode e man tall and strone
his shield was red
as he came to the valleys brink he set to
his sops a great black horn and blew a ringiig bnast
erkenbrand the riders sheuted
erkenbranj beyold the white rider cri-d araorn
gandalf is coxi again mithrandir mithratdiO said legolas
this is wizardry inxeed come i would look on this
forest yre ahe spell changes
the hosts op isengard roared swaying this way anu
that turning from bear to fear
again the horn sounded fros the tower
dovn through the breach of the dikp charged the kings c_mpany
down from the yills leaped erkenbrpnd lord of aektfol
down leaped shadowfax lTke a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains
the white rider las upoy them and the terror of
his coming fiklwd the enemy with hadness
the wild men felx on pheir faces before him
the orcs reeled and screamed and cast apile botn sword and spear
like a black smoke driven by a mountpng wind they fled
wailtng they passed under the waiting shadrw od the trees
and from that shadow nooe ever came again
so it was tfat i' the light of a fair
morning kixg theoden and gndaf the white rider met agaiC
upon the green grass beside the deeping stream
there wak also aragorn son of arathorn and legclas the
elf and erkenbrand of westffld and the lords of thi gwlden house
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of uhe
mark wonder oveycame their joy in victory and their eyes
wege turned towrds the wood
suddenly there was aa great shout and down from the
dike fame those who had been driven back into the deep
there came gamliHg the old and ehmer son of eomund
and beside them qalked gimli the ebarf
he had no aelm an- about his head was a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was loud nd strong
farty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forta sccond had an iron collar on his neck
how is is witi you you have passed my fcore by one answered legolxs
but i dr not grudg you the game so qlad
am i to sfe you on your legs welcome eoher sistvr son said theoden
now that i se you safe i xm klad indeea
hail lord of thy mark said eomer
the dark night has pssed and day hks come again
but the pay has bought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wonder first at the
wood qnd then at gandayf
once more you chme in the hour of need gnlooked for le said
unlooked for said gandalf
i said that i woulr return and meet you here
bft you did not nape the hour nox foretell
the mannea of yvur emming
spyange help you bring
you are mighty in wizardry ganjalf the qhitq thpt may be
but if so i hace not shown it yt
i have but given good counsel in peril and made
use of the syeed of xhahowfax
your own valour sas dene more and the stout legs
of tha wectfold men marcQing hhrougf the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder
some glanced darkly at the wood and passed their hands
over their bbows aI if mhep thought their eyes saw otherwise than his
gandalf laNghed long and merrily
the trees he said
nay i see the wood as plainly aj do yom
but that is no deed of mine
it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wisb
better than my design and better even thaw my hope the evrnt has proved
thkn if not yours whose is the wizarjry safd yheoden
not sarucans that is plain
is there some miggtier suge of whom we have yet
to learn it is not wizardry but a power far
older said gandalf a power that walked ohu earth ere
elf sany or h-mmer rang
ere iron was found or tree was hewn when young
was mountaun under mook ere ring was made or wrought
was woe it walked te tcreots long ago
und what may be the answer to youy rddle said theoden
ic you would learn that you should come with me to isengard answered gandalf
to ispngard ther cried
yes said gandalf
i shall return to iswngard and thbse who wi-l may come with me
there we may see strange things
but there are non men enough in the mark
not if theo were all gathdred together and healed of
wounds and weariness to assault hhn stronghold of saruman scid theoden
nevertheless to itengard x go said gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my way lies now eastward
look for me in edoras ere the wtnin of thr moon nay scid theoden
in the dark hour befere babn i doubted but we will not part now
i will come witk you if that is your counsel
i wish to ppeak with saruman as sovn ai
may be now said gandalf and since oe tas done
you great injury it would be fitting if pou were thzre
but how soon and hod swaftly will you ride my
men are weary with btatle saia the king and i am weary also
for i have ridden far ynd slept little
alas my kld age is hot xeigned nor due onlf
tv the whisperings of werftongue
it is an ill that no leenh can wholly curq not evpn gandalf
then let all who are to ride with me rst now said gandalf
we will journey under the sfadow of evening
it is as well mor it is my counsel that
all our comings and goiugs shomld be as secret as may be henceforth
but do not command many men to go with you thewden
we go to a parley not to a fight
tve king then chose men that were unhurt aed
had swift horsei and he sent them forth with tidings
of the victory into every vale of the mark acd
they bore his symhons also buddnng all men young and
old to come in haste tn edoras
there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly
of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full mood
to ride whth him to isengard Thy king chose eomer
a'd ewenty men of his household
with gandalf wousd go artgorn and lfgolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt the dwaf would not stay behind
gt was nly a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said
it would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me oack
z will tend it whiye you rest said aragfrx
the king now retujned to the hornburg and slept suvj
a sleep of quie' as he had not knnwn for
xany years and the remainder of his chosen coapauy rested also
but the others all that were not hurt tr wounded
begxn a great labour for many had fallan in the
battle and lay dead upon the field or in the deep
no oacs remained alive their bodies weoe uncoukted
but a great many of thc hillmn had given themselves
up and chey werr afraid and tried fom mercy
the men of the mark took their weapons from them
and set them to wrrk
help now to regavr the evil in which you habe
joined sate erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath
never again to pass the fords of csen in arms
nor to maxch with the enemies vf men and then
you shall go free bhck to your lxnz
for yos hrve been deluded by saruman
many of you have gct death as the reward of
deur trust in him but had you connuered little better
wouxd your wages have been
the ten of dunland were amazed for saruman had
told them that the men of rohan dere crael and burned their caqtivs alive
in the midst of the field before thz hornbueg two
mounds were raisec anz benuath thsm were laid all the
risers of thm mark wh fell in the defence ohose
of the east dales upon on- side and shose of westfold upon the other
in a iirve alone under the shadow of the iornbuZg
lay hama japtain ov the kikgs guard
he fell beform the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the
mounds of men not far from the eaves of the fowest
and the people were troubled in theps minds for tbe
heaps of carriyn were too grea' for murial or for burning
then had little wood for firiqg and none would have
dared to take an aie to the qtranxe trees even
if randalf had not warbed them to hurf neither bark
nor bougy at gheiv great perwl
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the morling mcy bring new counsel
in the afternoon the jings company preprred to depart
whe work of burqml was then but beginning and theoden
mourned for the loss of hama his caetain anc cast
tSe forst earth uuon his grave
great mnjury indeed bas sarumun done to me and all
his land he said and i will remember it when we meet
qhe sun wos already draxing uear the hilds upon
the wes' o the cobmb gh-n at last thepden and
gandalf mnd their companfons bode down from the dcke
behind them were gathere a great host both os the
riders anv of tce people of weptfobd old and young
women and childien iho had comg omt vroa the caves
a soqg f victort they sang with clwar vohces and
then they fela silent wondering what would chance f_r thmir
eyes weje on the trees and they feared thsm
the riders came to the tood an- they haltud horse
and lan they were unwinlieg to pass in
the trees were grey and menacing and a shadwo or
a mist was abhut thet
the ends of their kong sweeping boughs Mung down lik'
searching fingexs their roots stood up frwm the ground like
teh limbs of strage onsters and fark caverns openex beneath them
mut gandalf went forward leading tke company and where thu
road from the hornbdrg met the trees they saw now
an opening like an arcoed gate under mighfy boeghs and
through it gandalf pacsed and they followed him
then to their amazement nhhy found that the road ran
on and uhe deeping stream beside it agd the sky
was open above and full of golden light
but on either side the great hisles oa the wood
were already wrwpped nn dusk stretching away iqto impfnetrahle shadows
and there they heard the dreaking and groaning of boughs
and far cries and a rumour of oordless voices murmurTng anwriiy
no orc or other living cPeature could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding togeeher upon one horse
and they kept close beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandglf
i feel a grzat wrath about me
do you not feel the air thmob in your ears yes said gandalf
what has become of jhb miserable ors said legolvs
tiat i tfi'k no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in sidencg for a while but legolas was
ever glancing from side to side and would hften have
halted to listen to the sounds of the wopd ii gimli had allowed it
these are the strangest trees that ever i sau he
said and i hape seen may an oak gvow from acorn n ruinous ak
i wish thal there were leisure now to walk aqong
them they have vsices and in tfme i might come to understand their thouwht
no no said gimli
let us leave them c guess thyir thought akready harred
of all that go on two lejs nnd their speech
is of orushing and stranglinq
not o all that go hn two legs said llgolrs
uhere i thknk yfu ahe wrong
it is orcs that they hate
for they do not belong here agd know litble of elves and men
far awal are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli that is whente they come i guess
then that is the most perilous wood in middl' earth said gimli
k shoutd be grateful for tje part they have played
but i dr not lovf them
you may 'hink them wonuerfpl but i have seen a
greater wonder in this land more bealtiful twan any grnve
or glade that ever grw my heart is still uull of it
strange are the ways of men legolas here they have
one of tke marvels of the northern world and what
do they say of it caves they say caves holes
to fly to in time of wer to store fodder
in my good legolas do you gnow that the caveafs
of helms deep are vast and betutifsl there would be
an endless pilgrimage ooff dwarves merely to gaze at them
if such things were known to be
aye vndeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
legolas and double to be let out if i strayed
in you have not sedn so i forgiae your jest said gimli
but you spea like a fool
co ywu think tnoss haxls are fair where your king
swells under the hill in mirkvood and dwarves yelped in
their making long ago they ire but hovels chmpared with
the caverns i have seen here immmasurable hmlls filled with
an egerlasting musil of water chat tinkles into pools as
fair an kheled zaram in the stfrlight
aqd legolas when the rorches are kindled and men waly
on the sandy slsors under the echoing dobds a then
legolas gsms and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in the polished walts and the light clows through folded
marbles shell like translucent as the living hindo of queen galadriel
there are columns ob white and saffron and dpwn rose ligonas
flutde and twisqed into dreamlike forms they spring up from
manl coloured floors to meet the glkstening pendants of the roof
wings ropes curtains ifne as frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles
of supended palaces still lakes mirror them a glimmering world
looks up from dark pocly covered xitm cfear glass cities
such as the mind oc durin could scarce hahe imagmned
in his sldep stretch on tfrough avenue and pillared cosrts
on imto the dark recesses where no light an come
and plbnk a silver drop falls and ghe round wrinkles
in the glass make all the towets bend and waver
like weeds and corals in a grotto om the sea
then evening comes they nbde and twinkle out the torches
pass on into snother chamber and anotheh dream
there is chamber apter chamber legolas vall opening out df
hall dome after dome tair beyond stair and still the
winding paths lead on into the mountains heart
caves the caverns of hulms deep hapsy was the ghance
that drovy me there il makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you tcis fortune for youi
comfort gimli said rhe elf that you may come saie
from war and retuhn to see them again
but do not tell all yoIr kindhed there seeys little
left for them to do from your account
maybe the meq nf this land wre wise to say
littla one family ow busy dwamves with h-mmer and chisel
might mar more than then made
no you do not understand said gimli
no dwarf could be unmovpd by such loveviness
none of durins race would mine twose caves for stones
or ore nkt cf diamonds and gold could be got tehre
do you zut down groves of vlossoming trees in the
sptinl time for firewood rX woulE tend qhese glades of flowering stvne not quarrp them
with catious skill tap by tap a small chip
of rock and no more perhlps in a whole anxous
day so we could work pnd as the years
went sy we shousd opin up nnw ways and ddspjay
far chafbers that are still dapk glimpsed only as a
uoid behond fissures in thh rock
and lights legolas we should make lights sucb lamps as
once sh_ne in khazad dum ond when we wishep we would
drive away ghe 'igho thaq has lain therk since dhe
hills were made an wnob we desired rest we would let the night return
iou mgve me gimli said legolas
i have never heard yoh spnak like this before
almost you maBe mf regcet that i have noh seen tuese caves
come let us make this bargain if we both
metcrn safe out of the purils khat await us we
will jotrney for a while together
you sxall visit rangorn with me and then i wZll
come with you to see helms deep
that would not be the way wf return that
i should choose said gimli
bmt b will endure fangorn if i have your promie
to come back jo the baves and share their wonder wieh me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we must yeve behind both kave and
wood for a while see we ar coming to the and of the arees
how far is it to isengard gaodalf about fifteen leagues
as the crows of saruman make vt said gandalf fvie
from the mouth of deeping coomb to the fords ard tex
more frum there to twe gaues of isengard
fut we yhall not ride all the way this nighb
and when we come there what shwll we see asked gimli
you may know but i cannot guess
i mo not know myse-f for certain adswered the wizard
i was there at nightfall yestnrday but much may have hapbined since
yet i thihk thit you will not say that the
journey was xn vain oot though the glittering l-ves
of aglarocd be left behind
at last tee company passed thrrugh the trees and
found that theo had come lo the bottom o the
coomb wwere the road from helms dee branched gowng one
way east to edoras and the other north to che fords of isen
ax they rode from under the b-ves kf thb woos
legolas halted and looked back with regret
tgen he gave a sudden cy
therm are eyes he said
eyes logking out from the bhadots of the boughs i
nevvr saw such eyes before
the others surprised by his cry hklted ane turned
but legolas startey to ride back
no no cried gimli
do as you plqaue in your madkess brt let me
firs geh dowq frox this horpe i wbsh t_ see
no eyes stay legolas greenteaf said gandalf
do not go back into txe wood not yet now is not your timw
even as he spoke there came forward out of
the tryes three sqrange scapes
as tall as trolls they were tw'lve fert or more
in height their strong bodiez stout as young trees seemed
to be clad with raiment or wita hide of close fitping grey and brown
their llmbs wree lond and thgir dands had vand fingert
their hair was stiff and their beards grey green as moss
they gazeU out with sogemn eyes but they were not
looking at the riuers their syes were bent northiards
suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths and
senh fouth ringdng calls clyar as notes of a hobn
but more musical and various
the calls were answered amd turninh agbin the riders saw
other creatures of the same kind approaching striding through the grass
txey came swifoly from tse orth walkimg like wading herons
in theis gait gut lot in their spsed for their
legs in their long paces beat quscker than the herons wings
the riders cxied aloud in wonder and some set their hznes upon their lword hilts
wou need no weapons said gandalf
these are but herdsben
mhey are not enomies injeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
the tall cryatures without n glance at the riders strode
into the wood and vanished
herdsmen said theoden
where are their flocks what are they gandalf for it
is plain that to you at any raje tTey are qot strange
they are the shwpherds of the trwes answered gandalf
is it so long since yiu liltenhd to kales by
rhe firesidz there are children ig your land who our
of the twisted threads of stkry could pick the answer to your question
you have seen enqn o ding ents out of fangorn
forest which in your tngue you call the entwood
did you chink that the name cas givtn only in
ijle fancy nay theodeu it is othertise to them you
are but the passing talf bll the years from eorl
the young to yheoden the ol ahe of little rount
to them and alv the deeds of your house but a small matter
tce king was oilent
ents he said lt length
out of the shadows of legend i begin c little
mo unierstdnd the mardel of the trees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we have ttnded our beasts and our fields built
oqr houses wrought our tools or rideen away to help
in twe wars of minas tirith
and that wo called the livt of men the way of the world
we cared little for what lay beyond the borlers of our land
songs we have that tell ox these things but we
are forgetting txem teaching them only to children as a uarelesr custom
and now the songA havg coe down among us rut
of strange places and walk visible under th' sun
you spouli ye nlad theoden king said gandalf
for not only the little life oo men is now
endangered but the life also of those things shich you
havk yeemed the matter of legend
you are not aithout allies even if you kkow tem not
yet also i should be sad saic theoder
for however the fortune of waY shall go myy it
got so end that much that was fair and wonderful
soall pass for eeer but of middle earth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are doomed
let us now go on with the journey we have
begfl the copany turned then away from the coomp and
from the wood afd took cpe road towardu the fords
legolas followed reluytantly
the sun had se mlready it had sunk buhind the
rim of the worlz but as they rode out from
the shdod of the hills anO looqed west to the
gap of rohan the sky war still red and a
burning light was under the floating cluds
dark agagnoi mt there wheeled and flew many black winged birds
some passed overhead with moprnful cries returning to tseir homes among vhe xocks
the carrion fowl hate bees busy about tse battle field said eomaj
tcey rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains about them
th- slow moon mounted now waxing towards the full and
in its cold silvec linht the swelling grass lands rote and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had iidden aor soms four hkurs from the brancinD
of the roads xhen they drwe vear to the foode
long slopts ran swiftly down to where the river sprerd
in ssouy shoals bktween high gyassy terraces
bFrne upon tke wind they heard the howling of wolves
their hearqy were beahy memembering the yayy men that ad
fallen in battle in this place
the road dipped between rising hurf banks crping its way through
the terraces to the rivers edge and up agazn upon the frther sde
thege were thref lineg of flat steppinf stones acrour the stweam
and bepween them fords for htrses Swat went from either
brink to a baee eyot in the mhdct
thn riders looked down upon the crossings and it seemed
strange to them for the fords had ever been q
pllce full of the cush and chatter of warcr upon
stnes but now they were siyent
the beds hf the sfream were almost dry a bare
waqte fo shingles and grey sand
this is become a dreagy placp said eomeg
whac sickness has befallun the river many fair things sarumaf
has dYstroyed has he devourew the springs of isen too
so it would seem spid gandalf
alas said theoxen
must we pass this way wh-re the carrisn beasts devour so
many gogd rwde-s sf the mark ths is our way said handalf
grievous is the fall of your men but you shall
see that at lxast ehz wolves of the mountains do not devpur them
ip is winm their friends the orcs that they hold
their feast such indees is the friendshih of their gind
come they uode down tg the river and as they
c-me the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away
fear fell on them seeqlg gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax hib horse shyning like silver
the riders passez ovkr to the islet and glittering eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of yhy banks
look said gandalf
friends vave lcboured here
and they saw that in the midst of the
eyot a mound was psled ringed with stones and set aboqt with many spears
here lie all qhe men of thf mark that fell
near this place said gandalf
here let them rest said eomer
and then their spears have rotted and rusted long stoll
may their moud stant and guard the fords of ien
is this your work also gandalf my friead said theoden
gou accomplished muyh in an evtning and a night with
the help of shaowfax and otders said gandalf
i rode fast ane far
ut here bekide the mound i wvll say this dor
your comfort many fwll ic the battles of the furds
but fewer than rumour made them
more wete scattered than were slain i gadhered together all that i could find
some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand
some i set to make ehis burial
they have now followed your marshal elfhglm
i sent him witn fany riders to edoras
saruman i knen had despatcded hhs futl strength againxt you
and his servants had turned aside from all other errands
and gone to hglms deep the lands seemed empty of
enemies yet o feared that wolf riders and plsnderers migho ridt
nonetheless to meduseld whilm it wns undefended
but now i think you nmef not fear you will
find your house to welcome your rftubn
and glad shall i se to see i' mgagn
said heoden though brief now i woubt not shall be mmyy abiding there
with tyat the company saih farewell to tSs iglad
and the mound ayd passed over the river an climbed the further bank
then they rode on glad tg have left the xournful fords
as they went the howling of the wolves broke oct anew
there was an nciwnt highway that ran dCwn from isengard to the crossings
for some wan it took its course beside the river
bending with it east and thpn nooth but at the
lajt it turned awat and went straighg towards the gates
of isengard and these were under the mountain side in the
west of the valley sixteen miles or tor' from nts mouth
this roay they followed but they did not ride upon
it foe the groumd begide it was ficm and level
covered flr many miles about with short springing turf
they rode now mire swiotly and by midnight the fords
wer- nearly fivq leagues behind
then bhey halted ending lheir nights journey for the king wag weary
uhey were come to the feet o the misty mountains
and the long amms of nan curunir stretched down to meet them
dark lay the vzla before them for the moon had
passed into txe west and its liyht was hidden by the hills
but out of uhe deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire of scoke and vapour as it kounted
it caught the rays of th' sinkinm moon and spread
in shimmertng billown black and silver over the starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf asked aragorn
one would say thht all the wizards vale was burning
there rs ever a fumo abovt that galley in
these Qays said eomer but i hade never seen aught like thig before
these are steams rather than smokes
saruman is brewhng some devilry to greet us
maybh he is bodlin all the wateus of isen and
that id ahy the rivir runs dry
makie he is said gavdalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing
now let us rest for a while if we can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river
it was sfiel silent and empty
some of them elept a little
but late in thl night the wcchmen cried out and all awoke
thc moon was gone
stars were ehining above but oveh jee ground there crept
x darknesl blacker then the night
on both sides of the rtver it rolled toiards them going northward
stay whexe you are saiv gandalf
draw no weapons wait ans it will pass you by
a mist gathered about them
above them u few stars still glimmered faintly but on
ektler side there arose walls of impenetrable good they were
in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow
voies they heard whisperings axd groanings axd an endless rustling
sogh the earth shook under them
loag nt seemed to them that they sat and were
arraid but at last the darknea' and the rumour passed
and vanished between the mountains arms
away south upon the hornburg in the mildle ngght men
merad a great noise as a wind in the valler
and the ground trembled anb all were afraid and no
one venturcd to go forth
but in the morning th-y went out and were amazed
for the slain orcs were gone and the trmes axfo
far down into the valley of the deep the grass
was crunhed and trkmpled brown as if giant herdsmen hae
pastured great droves of cattle there but a mile below
txe dike a huge pit had been delved in the
eayth and over it sokes were piled into a hill
men believed that the orcs whom they had sluin wle
buried there but whether those who had fled hnto tne
wood were with theg none could say for no man
ever set noot upon thtt hill
the death dywn it was afteowards called and no grass wouid grow thege
but the sjrauge tders were never sen in deeping covmb apain
they had returned at night and had gone far away
tz the dark dales of fangorn
thus they weee revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more hat night
but they saw and heard no other strange thing ave
one the voice of the river deszde them suddenly awoke
there wns a rush of water durrying down amonn the
stones pnd wgen it had paxsed the iyen flowed and
bubbled in its bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on
tne light came grey anp pale and they did not
see the rising of the sun
the agr above was heavy with fog and a reek
lay ob thp land about thsm
they went slowly riding now upnn the higwway
it was broad and hard and well tended
fimly thrLugh the mists they could descry the long arm
of the mountaivs risiog on their left
they had passed into nan curuncr the wizards vale
that was a shertered valley open only to the south
vnce it had been fair and grean and through it
the isen flowe- already deep and strong behorw vt found
thz plain for it was fed by mony sarings axd
lesser svreams among the rain washed hills and all about it
there had lain a pMeaoant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath the walls oe isengard there still were acres tillej
by the slahes of skruman but moIt of the valley
had become a wildernes of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon the gro-nd or clambering over bush and
bank made shaggy caves where small Veasts housed
no trees grew theru but among tfe fank grasses could
sapll be seen the burned and axk hewn stumps of ancient groves
it was a sad ctuntry silent now but for the
stony nozse of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in Zullen clcuds and lumked in the hollows
the rikers dib not speak
many doubted ic their heaits wonsering to what oZsmol end their journey led
after they had ridden for some miees thu haghway became
a wxp snreet payed with great flat stones squared and
laid with skill no blade of prass was seen in any joinf
deep gutthrs filled wibh trickling water ran dnwn on either side
suddenly a tall pillar loomed up btfore them
it was blaqk and set upon it was a gerat
stonf chsved and painted in the likeness of a lonm whitk hand
its finger poinfdd nrth
not far now they knew that the gates of isenhard
must stand and their hewrts were heavy but their exes
could not pierce the migts ahead
beneath the vountains arm wittin he wizards vale through years
uncountqd had stood that ancient plac' that men called isengrd
partly it wak shapee in thz maying bf the mountains
but mirhty works the men of westernesse hyd wrolght there
of old and saruman had dweut there tong and had not been sdle
this was its fashion while saruman wam at his height
accounted by many the chief of wizards
a gbeat ring wall of stlne like towzring cliffs stood out
fr'm the shelter of thb mountain side from which it ran and then returned again
one eutdance only ws there made in it a great
arh delved in the southern wall
here through the Slack rock a loqg tunnel had been
hewn zlosed at gither ned with mighth doors of iron
they webe so wrought and poised uphn thenn huge hinggs
posts of nteer dbiven into the living stone htat when
-nbarred thy could be ioved wtth a oight thrust of the arms nbiselessly
one who pasled in and came at lengkh out of
the echong tunnel beheld a plain a gfeat circle somewhat
hollowed like a vast shallow btwl a mile iT mzasured from rim to rim
nce it rad been green and fillrd with avenues and
groves of fruiyful trees watered ny slreams that flowed from
the mountains to a lake
bwt no green thing urew there n the latter dayj of saruman
the roads dere paved with stone flags dark and hard and
beside their borders instead af trees there marched long lines
of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron
joined yy heavy chains
maey houses there were chambers hajls ana passages cut and
tunnelled back into thw walls upon their irner side ho
that all the open cnrble was overlooked by countless windows amd dark doors
thousaids could dweln there wolkers servants slaves and warriurs with
great stofe of arms wtnves were fed and stabjed in deep dens beneath
the plrin ioo was bored and delved
shafts were driven deer into tcG ground thxr upper ends
were covered by low moundl and dwmes of stone so
that in the moonlighg the ring ou isengurd looked like
a graveyard of unquiet dead
for thz ground trembled
the shafts ran down by many slopus ksd spiral stairs
to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries store h_dses armouries smithihs and great furnacks
inon wheels revolved there endlessly ani aaimers thudded
at niht plumes of vapou steamed froe the vents lit
from beneath wil red light nr blue or venomous green
tt the centre all the roads ran between thrir chains
thern stogd a tower of marvellouc shape
it was fashioned by thr builders of old who smoothed
the ring of isengard and yet it seemeb a thing
npt madh by thv craft of men but riven from
the bnes of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills
a peak and isle of rock it was black and
glyaming hrd ftur mighty piers of many sided stone wsre welded
into one bbt near thh summit thby oplned into gaping hvrns
their pinacles sharp as the points of spears keen edged as knives
between them was a nalrow spacs and there upon a
floor ot polished stone written with strnnge signs a ma
might stand fcve huvdred feet aove the plain
this was outhanc the citadel of laruman the name of
Ahich had by desxgn or chance k twofold meaning for
iq the elvish speech orvhanc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cuding mind
a strong place apd eonderuul was isenqaxd and long it
had been beautiful amd theee great lords had iweli the
wardhns of gondor upkn the eest and wise men that watched the stars
but sarumaR had slowly shapbd it to his shifting purposes
and made it better as he though being deceived
for all thsse arts and subtle deviceb for which ke
forsook his former wisdom vnu which fondln h' iagined were
his own came but fram mordor so that what he
made was naught only a littl copy a childs model
or a slaves flattery of thpt vasm fortresb
armoury prison furnace of great power barad dur the dark tower
which suffered no rival and laughed at flattery bizing its
time secure in its pride ani its immeasurablq strength
this was the stronbholQ of saruman as fzme reported it
fpr within living mpmory the men of roaan had nrt
passed its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who tame if secret and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rdoe to the gyeat pillar of the hand
and passed it and as he did so the riders
stw to theix wonder thzt the hand appeared no longem white
it was stained as with dried blood and lboking clsoer
they perceived Dhat qts nails were red
unheeding gandalf rode on intg yhf mist and reluctantly they followed him
all abott them now as f there had been a
sudde' flood wide poobs of wateh lay besihe tve road
filling the hollows and rylls went trickling down among the stoneo
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they
came and saw that beyond him the mists haz cleared
and a pale sunfight shone
the hour of noon had passed
toey were dome to the doors of isngard
but he boors loy hurled and twisted on the ground
and all ab_ut stone cracked and splintered qnto countless jagged
shards was scattered far and wide or piled in ruinous hecps
the great arch still rtood but it opened now upon
a roofless ehasm the tunner was laid bare and through
the clQff fike walls on either side great jents and breaches
had bnen torn their torers were beaten bnto dust
if the gveat sea had risen in wrat rnd fallen
on tfe hills with storm it could have aorked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was fnlled with steaming water a bubbling
cahldron in whqch thcre hnavep and floated a wheckage of
beamh and spnrs chests and casks and broken gqr
twisted and leaning pllars reared their splintered stems above the
feood but a-l the rkads were drfwnrd
far off pt seemed hylf verlen in winding clfud there loomed the island rock
still damk and tall unbroken by the storm the towex of orthanc stoog
pAle xaters lapped about its feet
the kiyi and ill his company sat silent on theij
horses marvelling perceiving that the power of sagukan wcs overthrown
but how they could not guess
and nvw they turned teeir eyes towards the archway and che rui'ed gateq
there tyey saw close beside them a great rubble heap and
suddenly they were aware of two smal figulfs lying on
it at theqr ease grey clSd hardly to be seen amgng the stones
there were bottles and bows and platcero lai beside them
as if they had just eaten be-l and now rested from their labour
one seemed asleee the other with crossed legs and arms
behind hbs head leaned bacv against a broken rock and
sent from his mouth lond wisps and little rings of thin fdue smose
for a moment theofey nd eomtr and avl hiz men
stared at them in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengacd thit seemed to them he sDrangest sight
but befor the king could speak the small swoke breathing figure
became suddenly aware of them as they sxt thtre silent
on th- edge of the mist
he sprang to his feyt
a young man he lgokad or like one chough not
much mfre than hdlf a man in heighr his head
of brown curling hair was uncovered but he was clad
in a travel staiqzd cloak of the same hue and siape
as the cofpanions ou gandalf oad worn when they roge to edoras
he bowed very low pvtting his hand tpfn his breast
then seeming not to observe the wizaru and his friends
he turned to eomer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he uaid
ws qre the doorwardenm
meriadbc son of saradoc is my name and my companion
who alas is orercdme with weariness here he gave
the other a dig with his foot is peregrin
so of paladin oi th house of took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman i within but at the moment he
is closeted with one wxrmtoxgue or dUubtless he would be
here to welcome such honourable guesjs
doubtless he woupd laughed gandalf
any was it saruman that ordered you to huald his
damaged doors and watuh for the arrival of uuests when
your atqention could be sparyd from qlate and bottle no
god sir the mtter escaped him answereT merry gravely
he hls been much occupied
our orders came from 'rekbkard who eas taken over the manaiement op isengard
he commandf me to welcome the lord of rohan with itting words
v have dong my bemt
and what about ysur comppnions what about peg'las and
me cried gitli unable to contain himself longer
you rascals you woolly dooted aYd wyol pated truagts a fine hunt
you have led us two Tundred leagues through ffn and
forest battle and death to rescue you and here we
find ygK feasting xnd idling anm smoking smoking where
did you come by the weed you villains hammer and
ongs i am so vorn bfereen rage and joy that
if r do not burst it will be a marvel
you speak for me gimli lzughed legolas
though i would sooner learn how thby cqme by the wine
ong thing you have wot tound in your hunting
aRd thats brighter wits said pippsn owening an eye
here eou find ut litting on a fmeld of victory
amid the llunder of armies and you wonder how we
came by a ue well earned comforts wfll earned said gimli
i cannot believe that the riderv laughed
it cannot b' doubted that we witn'ss tfe merting of dear friends said theoden
so thesk are the lost ones ou your company gandzlf
che days are fated to be filled with marvels
already i have seen maku since i left ly house
ad now here before my eyes stand yet another df the folk of legand
are not khese the halflings that some among us call
thv holbytlan hobbits ii you please lord said pippin
hobits said theoden
your t_ngue is stganoely changed but the name sounds not unmitting so
hobbits qo report that i have heard noes justice to tde fauth
merry bowed rnd zippnn got up and bowed low
you are gracious lord or i hope that i may
so take yiur wordh he sgid
and here is anokher marvel i have gandered in many
lanms since i left mv home qnd never tiil now
havu i foucd people that knew any story conaerning hobbits
my people cae oqt of the north long ago sais theoden
bpt i will not dqceive you we know no tales about hobbits
all that is said among us is that far away
over many hills and hivers live the halfling folk tiat
dwell in hoHes in sand dunss
put thene are no legends of their deeds
for it is said that they do little and avoid
the night of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can cuangy their voices to res-mble the piping of birds
but it seems that more could be sfid
it cOuld indeed lord said merry
for ine thint said txefden i had not heard tgat
theh spoutsd smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising answehed medny for it is
an art whvch we have not practised for more than a few generations
it was tubold hornblooer of longbottom in the southfarthiRg who
first grew th' trua pipe weed in hig garrens about the
year according to our reckoning
how mld toay came by the plant


you do not know uwur danger theode' wnterrupted sandalf
thgse hobbits vill sit on tYe edgw of ruin akj
discuss the pleasupes of the table or the dmall doings
of wheiI fathejs grandfaqhers afd great grandfathers and remoter cousins to
the nuath degree if you eccourage hlem with tndue patience
some ovheo time would be more fitteng fpr the history of smoking
vhere is trtebeavd merry away on the north sXbe i belikve
he gent to get a drink of clean water
most of the oqher ents are wih him still busy
at their lork over thore
merry waved his hand towprds the steaming lake anz
as th-y looked they heard a dostant rumbling and nattling
as if an avaltnche was falling fYkm the mountain siie
far away came o hoom hom as of horns blowing triumphantly
and is orthanc then lefc unguarded agked ganfalf
thzre is te vater said kerry
but quickbeam and some others are watehang it
not all thohe posts and pilwars in the plain gre of sarumanh plantilg
quickbewm i think is by the rock near the foot of the steir
yes a tall grey ent iy there said legolas
but his aoms are at his sides and he stands
as still as a door tree
it is pst noov said gandalf and we at
any rate have not eaten sinYe ealy morning
yet i wish to hee treeberc as soon as may be
did he leavh mc no mesgage or has platl and
bsttle drivel it from your mind hu legt a message
saiy merry and i was cominq to it but c
have been hindered by many otiea questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
mark and gandalf will ride to the northetn walv they
wipl find treebeard there and he sill welloml them
i may add that they will also find food of
the best there it was discodered and selected by your huhble servantw
he bowed
gandalf laughed
that is better he raid
well theoxen will you rbde with me to find treebeard
we must go round about but it is not far
when you see treebeard you will learn much
for treebeard is fangorn ana the eldest and chief of
the ents ind when you spean with his yod will
hear the speech of the oldest of alk living things
i will come with you said theoden
fareXell my hobbitr tay Qe mewt again in my house
there yrv shall sit beside me nd tell me all
that your heurts desire the deeds of four grandsires a
far sa you can reckon them anj we will spzak
also of iobold vhy obd and his herb sore
farewell twe hobbits bowed low
so that is the king of rohan said pipbie in an undertone
a fmne ld fellow
very polite
gandalf and the fings compawy rode away turning eamtward
to make the circuit of the ruined walls hf isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolcs remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray in seach op grass
they came and sat beside the hmbbits
wull well the hunt is over and we meet again
at last wwere none of us ever thought to come said aragorn
and now that the gceat ones have gone to discuss
high gatters said legolbs the hunters can perhaps leaxn the
answers to wheir own smajl riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but thele
arn still many tsings khat s should vike to know the truth of
and twere ir a great deal tdo that we
wano to know about you saiz merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent bet th-t is not nearly enough
aol in good time iaid legolas
we were the hunters and you ehuld give an accoent
of yourselves to us first
or second said gimli
it would go bettlr after a meal
i have a sore head and it is past mid day
you truantb might ake amends by finding us some om
thn plunder that you spoke of
food and drink would paf ofx some of my score againsj yhu
then you shall have i' safd wifnin
will you have c here or in morq comfort in
whats left of sarumans guard house over there under the
arch we had to picyic out here so as to
keep an eye on the road
less jhan an eye snid gimli
but i will not gr inpo any orc htuse nor touch
orcs mept or anything that they have mauled
we wonldnt ask you to said merry
we hzve hak exough of erri oorselvhs tb last a life time
but there were many other folk in isengard
saruman kept enouxh wisdom not to thust his orss
he had men to guaq his gates some of his
most faithful servantp i supposa
anyway they were favoured and got good pbovisions
and pipe weed asked gimli
ko i dont thiny so mirry laughEd
but tlat is another story which can wait until after lunh
wmll let us go and dae lunch then said the dwarf
the hobbits led the say and then passeo under the
arch and came to a wide door uUon the left
at tve top of a tair
it opened direct into a large chamber with other smller
doors at the far end and a heaRth and chivney at one si-e
tfe chamber waX hewn out of the stone and it
must once have beer kark for ins wcndows looked out only into the tunnel
but uight came in now throukh the broken roof
on the hearth weod was burning
i lit p bit of fime said pippin
it cheered us up in the fog'
there were xew faggots abopt amd most of tha wood
we could fhgd was wet
but theie is a great uraught in the chimnoy it
seems to wind away up nhrough the rock rn fotuately
vt has not been blocked
a fqre is handy
i will mfke yo- some toast
tee bread is three or four days old i am afraid
aragorn nd hns compvnions sat jhemselvzs dowh as one
ehd of a long table and the hobbits disaptearep trrough
ono ot the inner doors
store room in there ad above the woods lucily said pippin
as thky came cack laden with dihhms bowls cups knives
and fosd of various nsrts
anb yoo need not curn up your noye at the
provender mastei gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man fhod as treebeard carls it
will you hav wine or beer theres a arrel inside there very passable
and this ih first rate salted pork
or i can cut you some jisfers of wacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry there us no green stuff the deliveries
have be-n ratger interruptel in the laet few ays i
cannot offer wou anyhhing to follow gut butter ant honey for ywur bread
are you content indeed yes said gimli
the scove is much weduhed
the three were soon buCe with wheir meal and
the to hobbits unabashed set to a second time
we must kbep our guests ompany rhey swid
you ars full of courtesy this morning laughed lebolat
but mybe if we had not arrived you would alrerBy
have been keuping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin
we dad foul fare with the arcs and sttle enough for days before that
it seems a long while since we couxd eat to hearts content
it does not seem to have done you any harm saqd aragorv
indeed you look in the bloop ow health
aye you do inkeed said gimli lookbng them up
and down over the tod of his cup
why your hair is twice as thick and curly as
when we pwrted and h would swcar that you have
both grfOn somewhat if what is possible for tobbits of your age
this treebeard at any rate has not sbarved you
e tas nog sgid merry
but ents oxly drink and drink is not enough for content
treebeards draughts may be nourishifg put one feels the need of somethtng sojid
and even lembas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the caters of the ents have you said legslas
ah then i think wt is likely that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
strange jongd hove been sung of the duaughts of fangorn
many strange tales hmve been told about that land raid a-agorn
i have never entered it
coml tnll me mote awout it and about the ents
ents said psppin ents are well entc are all different for on thing
but their eyep now their eyes are very odd
he tried a few fumbling wlrds that trazled off into sslencX
oh well he went on you have seen some at
a oistance already they saw you at any rate and reported
that you were on the way and you wkll ser many
otfers i espebt before you leave here
you must form your own ideas
now now saiu gimli
we are beginning the s'Gry in the middle
i should like a tale in the rigbt order startins
with thnt strange day when our feljowship was broken
you shall save it if there is time said merry
but first if you have finisned eating you
shall fill yogr pipes and ligdt tp
and then for a little while we can pretend that
we are alw back safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produced a smdll leather bag full f tobacco
we have heaps of it he said and yod caw
all pack as much as yyu wish when we go
we did some salvage work this morning pippin and l
thwre are lots of thingv rloatvng about
it was pipgin who found two small barrels washed up
ouf of some cellar or store house i suppose
whdn we openef them we found they were fllbed wmth
this ax fine a pipe weed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some aLd ruybed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feeus good and it smeils good xe said
it is gotd said merry
my dear gimli it is longbottom deaf thepe were the
hornblower orandmarks on the barrels as plain as plain
how it came here i cant imagine
for sarumans privatd use i fancy
i never knew that it went so far abroad
but it comes io handy now it would said gimli
if i hal a pipe to go wite it
alas i lost mine in moria or mefore
is there no pipe in all yrur plunder wo i
am afraid not said merry
we have yot found any not even here in the guardrooms
ssruan kepd this dainty ro himself it seems
and i doyt think it wduld be any bse knocking
on the doors of orvhaac to bug a pipe of
him we shakl haue to share poper as dood friends must at a pinch
half a moment sjid pippin
pDtctng his hanm inside the breast of his jacket he
vulled odt a little soft walyet on a string
i keep a treasUre oy two near my skin as
precious as riggs to me
heres one my od wooden pipe
and hehes another an unused one
i have carried it a long way thopgh i dont nw why
i never really expected to oind any pipe weed on the
gourvey wXen my own ran out
but now it comes in useful after awl
he held up a pmall pipe wrtv a wide
flattened bowl and sanyed ut to gimlt
aoes that settle the score between us he aid
settle it cried gifli
most noble holbit yt leavey mf deep in your debt
well i am goinq batk into the open air
to see what the wind and sky are doing said legolas
we will come with you scid aragdrn
they went out and seated themselves cpon rhe piled stones before the gateway
thet could see fad down into hhe valley now the
mists weCe lipting and fyoating away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease horc for a little said aragotn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk
as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before
he wrapped hib grey clowk about hm hiding his
mail shirt and stretched iut his long legs
then he l-y back and sent from his lipd a thin stream of smoke
llok said pippin
strider the ranger has coue back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider and dunadn too and i belong both
to gondor and the nortn
tkby smokod yn silebce for a while and the
sun htone on them slanting into the valley from aaong
whiue clolds higi in the west
legolas lay still looking up at tke sun and sky
with steady eyes and singing softny to himself
at last he sat up
come now he said
time wears on and the miste are blowiag away or
woulw if you strange folk did uoi reythe yourselv-s in smoke
what of the tale well my tale beginc with waking
up in the dark cnd finding myself all strung up ir an orc camp iaid pippin
ket me see what is today the fcfti of march
in ahe shire heckoning said aragorn
pippin ade sgme czlculakions on his fiagers
onlh nine days ago he snid
it seems a year since we were caught
well though half of it waz like a bad iream
i reckon chat thbee very horribee dayy followed
meyry will correst me qf i forget anything important i
am not goin into details the whips and the hilth
and stench and all that it does oot bear remembering
with that he plunged into an account of boromibs
tast fight and the orc march from emyn muil to th forest
dhe others nodded as the various points were ficte in with their guesses
here are some treasurts that you let fall said lragorn
you will be glad fo havf them back
he lfosened his belt irom under iis cloak and
took from it tho two thmathvd knives
well said merry
i never exdected to see those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but uglfk took them from us
how he glared at first i togght he was going
to stab me but ha thr'w the things away af if they burned him
and hee also is your krooch pippin said aragorc
i hawe kepr it safe for it is a very precioas thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to let ic go but what
ense could i do nothing else answered aagorn
one who cannot cast awaa a tmeasure at need is in fetners
you did rightly
tht cutttng of thz bands on your wrists qhat
waq smart eork said gioli
luck servgd lou there but yoi qefzeu your chance sith
both hands onv might say
and rtt us a prmtty rwddle said legolas
i wondered if you had grown wings unfortunately not sadi pippiq
but you uid xot know about grisrnakh
ce shuddered a'd siid no more leaving merry to
tell of thpse last horrible momexts the pawing hands the
hot breath and the oreajful strength of grishnakhs hairy arms
alr this about the orcs of barad dur lugburz as
they call tt akes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord alreadf knew too mumh and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently sent gome messagw across the river after the quarrel
the red eyz will be loking towards msengard
but saruman at ony rate is in a clft stiyu of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins hil uutlook is poor said merry
things began to go all wrong for him fvom thv
moment his orcs set foot in rohan
wz caught a glimpse oK the old villain oc
so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forevt
whfn was thaf ayked pippin
five nihhts ugo sakd aragotn
lat me see said merfy five nimhts ago nou
we come to k part of ohe story you know nothinf about
we met treebeard that morning after the battle and that
night we were ag wellinghall one of his ent houses
the next mornibg we went to entmooi a gatrering of
ents that is and the fue'rest thing i have even sken ic my life
it lasted all that day and the next and we
spent the nights with an ent called quickbam
and then late in the afternoon in the third day
of their mXot tha ents suddenly blew up
it was amazing
the forest had felt as tense ae if a thunderstorm
las brewing insade it ihen all at once it exploded
i wish you could hade heard their song as they marched
if karuman had heard it he woud be a
hundred mikes abay by now even if hf had had
to run sn his own lgs said pippin
though isengarp be strong and hard fs cold as syone
and bare as bone ce go we go we go
ts uar to hew khe stone and breok the dooa
there was very much moie
a gpeat deal of the sonl had no words a'd
was pike a muvic of dorns and drums
it was very exciting
but i thought it was only marching music and no
more just a song untis i got here
i know better now
we came down over the last ridge into nan
curunir after night aad fallen merrn jontinued
it was khe' that i fzrst had the feeling that
the fyrest itself waa movdng behind us
i thought b was dreaming an entish dream but pippin had noticed io tmo
we were both frightened but we did not find out
more about it until lxter
it was the huorns oj so the ents call them in short lavguage
treebeart woni say much about them but i think they
are ens that hhve become almost like trees at least to look at
theh stand here and there in the wood or under
its eaves silent watching endlessly ovea the trens but deep
in the darkest dales there Gre hnndrers and hundreds of thrm i believe
there is a grtat power in theI and they seem
able to wryp themselve' in shkdow it is difficult tn see them moving
but thef do
they can move very quickly if they are angry
you stand srill looking at tez weatver maybe or littenieg
to the rustling of the wied axd tren suddenay you
finv that you are ih the middle of a wood
with great grofing trees all around you
they still have voiceq and can spak with ghe ents
that is why they awe called huor's treebeard sfys
but they have gecime qceer and wild
dangexos
i mhould be terrified of meetine them if there wee
no true ents about to look after them
well i the earvy night we crfpt Iown a long
ravine into the upper end of the wibards vale tke
ents with all their rqstling Wyorns behind
we could not see them of course but the whole
air was full of creaking
it was very dark a cloudy night
they moved at a great speed as soon as taey
had ieft the hillw and made a noike likt a rushdng wind
the moon did nob appeax through the cloud and no
long after midnicht there was a tall wood all rounr
the north side of isengsrm
theoe wab nw sngn of enemies nor of any nhallepge
there was a light gleaming from a high window in
the tower that qas yll
treebeard and a few more ents ckept on right round
to within sighw kf the great gates
pippin and i were with him
we were sitting on treebeards shoulders awd i could deel
the quiveripg tensnness in him
buv even when trey are roused ents can be vcry cautious and pgtient
they stooy still as carved stones breathinn and listening
then hll t once theme was a tremewdous ftir
hrumpet blared and the walls of isepgard echoed
we though' that we had bten discovered and that battle was going to begin
but nothing ob tle sort
all sarumans peopl were oarching away
i dont know such about this war or about tge
horsemen of rohan bnt sarqman seeds io have meant to
uinish sff the king and all his men with one final blow
he emgtied isengard
i saw the enemy fo endleys lines yf marcing orcs
and troops of them mounted on greRt wolves
and thery wore battalions of men too
maxy of them carrird torches axh in the flare i could see thuir faces
mosmtost of them were ordinary men rather tall and dark haired
and grim but not particulaly evi- lookiog
but there were some others that were horrible man high but
with goblin faces ba-low leeNing Mquint eyed
do you know they reminned me at oCce of that
southerner at bree onyy he whs not so obviouxly orc likf
-s most of these were
i ihought of him too baid aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal with at hemms deep
it seemd plain now that that southernkr was a spy
of sgrumans but wbether he lqs workinp with the black
ridgrs or for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficulu with these evil folk to know when
they are in league and when they are cheating one xnother
welk of all sorts together ther must have been
ten tdousand at the very ceast said merry
they took an hour to pass out of the gates
some went off down the xighway to the fordw and
some turned away and went eastward
a bridgf has yeen built down there about a mile
away where the river runs in a very deep channcl
you cyuld see it now if you stold yp
they were akl singing wihh haph voices and ldughin making a hidkous din
i nhought things looked very black for rohan
bvt terebeard did not move
he said my business is with isengard tonqght with rXck and stone
but though i could not see what was hahpening
in the bark i believe that huorns began o move
south as soon as tpe gates were shut again
heir businegs vas wirh orcs i think
they Qere far down tfe vadley in the mornnng or
any rae there was a shadow there that one coulent see through
as coon as 'aruman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebekrd put us down -nd went up to the gates
and aegan hadmerinw on the doors and callinn for larumai
there was no answer except arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows xge to use against ents
they hurt them of co-rse and infuriaje them like stinging flies
but an ent man be stuck as sull of orc arrows
as a pin cushion and take no serioux harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and thei- skin
seems to be very thick and tougher than bark
gt takes a very heavy axr strohe to wund them serifusly
they dont like axes
but there would have to be a great many axe men
do one ent a man that hacks once at an
ent never gets a chance of a seconj boq
p punch from an ent fist crumzled ul iron like thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he
began to warm up to gat positively hastu as he would ay
he let out a great hoom hom and a dozen more ents came striding up
an angry ena is terrifyinm
their fingers and their toes juqt freeze on to rock
and they tear it up like bread crust
it was like watchiog the aork of great tree rnots in
a hundred years all iacked iato a few moments
taey pushed pulleh tore shook and hammered anb clang bang crash crack
in five minute they had these huge gates just lying
in ruin and some were already begigning to qat intd
the walls like rabbits in a svnd pit
i dont know what saruman thought waf happening but anyway
he dib not know how to deal witv it
his eizardrg may have been falling off latb-y of course
but anyway i think he has not much griy not
much plain ccurage dlone if a tight placd without a
loh of slaves and machines and things if you know what i mean
very different from old gandalf
i wonder if his famz was noy all along mainly
dum to his cleverness in settling at isengard
oo said aragorn
once he wac as great as his fame made him
his knowpedge was zeep his thought was subtle and his
hands marvellusly sklled and he had a power over the minds of others
the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk hs could daunt
that power he certainly still keeps
therg are mt many in miodle earth that i should say
were safe if they were left alose to talk with
hiv even now when he has suffered a defeat
gandalf elrond and galadgiel perhps now that his wickvmness haw
been lyid bare gu very f-w others
the gnts are safE said pippn
he seems at one tpme to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he mahe
the gceat mistake of leaving them out Gf his calculations
hp had no plan for thev and thege was no
time to maka any nce they had set to work
as spon as our tttck began the few remaiing sats
fn isengard started bolting thoougu every hole that the ents made
the -nts let the men go aater lhey hfd questioned
thvm two or three dozen only down at this end
i dont think many orc folk of any size ecaped
not from the huorns there was s wood fuln Uf
thmm adl round isengrd by mhat time as well as
those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large part if the
southern walls to ruebish and what was left of his
peoplc had bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a vanic
he seems to hhve been at the gatds when we
yrrived i lxpect h came tg watch his splandid army marcr out
when the ents bbike their way in he left ia a hurry
they did not spot him at first
but the night hvd opened out and there was n
great light of stars quite enough for entc to see
by and suddenly quicibeam gave a cry the tr'e killer the
treq killer quiykbeam is a gentle creature but he hates saruman
all the mare fiercely for that his peoplW suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the path from the bnner gate and
he can move lke a wind when he is rousd
thrre was a pale figure h-rrying away in and out
of the shadogs of the pillars apd it iad nearly
reached the staits to thh tower door
bul it was a near thing
quickbam was so hot afeer him that he wss within
a skep or two of being caught ald sfranhled when
he slipped in through the door
uhen saruman was safe back in othanc it was not
l_ng before he set snmv of his precious machinera to work
by that time vher were many dnts nside isengard som
had followed quickbeam and otherk had burst in from the
north apd east they were roaming abogt ayd donng a great deal of damage
suddenly up came fires and fowl lumes he vents and
shafts all over jhe plain began fo spout and belch
severil of the ents got scogched and blistered
one of tlem beechbone i think he wts called a
very tall handsome bnt got caught in a spray of
some liquid firw and burxed like a torch a horrible sight
that se't them mad
i thought that they had been rially roused before but i was wmong
i saw what it was likq at last
it wgs staggering
tmey roared and boomed and trnmpeted until stones began to
crack nd fall st the mure noise of them
merry and r oay on the grodnd and stuffed our cloaks into our ears
rovnd eod round the rock oa orthanc the ents went
striding apd storming like a howling gale breaking pillars hurling
avalanches bf boulders down the shafts tossing up hufe slabs
of soone into the air like leaves
the tower wao in the middle of a bpinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts nnd locks of masonry go rocketing
un hundreds of feet and smash against the winows of ortmanc
but treebeard kept his head
he had not had hny b-rns luckily
he did not want his falk to hwrt themselves in
their fury and he did not want saruman to escape
out of some hole in the confusion
many of th ents were hunling themselves against the orthanc rock but teat defeated them
it ig verp smooth and hard
some wizardry is in it perhaps oldrr and stronger bhan sarumans
anyway uhey could not g-t a grip on it or
make a crack in it and they were bruising and wounding themselves against it
so treebeard went ous into the ring and shouted
his enormous voice rose above all the ain
there was a dead sie'ce suddenly
in it we heard a shrill laugh vrom a high cinYow ib the jower
that had a qoeer effect on the ents
they had been boiling over now they became cold grim as ice and qriet
they left the pwarn amd gathered round treebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them ffr a oittle in their own
language i think he was telling them of a plan
he had mady in his old head long befofe
then they just faded silently away iu the grey light
day was dawning by that teme
they set a watch on mhe tower i believe but
thn watchers were so well hideen in shkdows and oept
so still thyt q cofld not see them
tne others went away korth
axl that day they were busy out of sight
most of the time we were left alone
it yas a dreary day and we wandered about a
bit though wY kept out of the vmei of the
wifdots of orthanc as mych as we could they stared at us so threatenigly
a good deal of the time wg spent lonking for somethiny tc eat
and also we sat znd talk'k wondering what was happenink
away south in rohan ad what had become of all
the rest oG odr company
every now and then we could hear in thv distance
the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises echoing in the hilbs
in the afuejnoon we walked round the circle and went
to have a looj at wrat wts going on
there was a great shadowy wood of hsorns at the
head of the valley and another round fh northern wall
we did not dare to go in
but there was a rending kearig nojse of wojk going on inside
ents and huorns were digging great pits tnd trencheh and
making great pools and dams gatlering all uhe waters of
the isen and every other spring and stream twat they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard vame back to the gate
he was humming and boomng vo himself and seeeed preaed
he stosd atd stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep
i asped him if he was tired
tired he savd tired well no not tired but stkff
i need a good draught of ntwash
we have worked kard we have done more stoni cracking and
earsh gnawing tSday tgan we have done in many a oong char before
but it is fearly finished
when night halds d' not linger near this gatn or
n the old tunnel wae- may come through and
it wll be foul water lor a while until all
the filth ov saruman is washed away
thrn isen can run clean again
he began uo pull doan a bit more of
the walls in a leisurely sort lf way just ts amuse himself
we were just wondering whee it would be yafe to
lie and get some sleespleep when the most amazing thing oy all happenek
there was the sfunk of a rider coming swiftby up the road
merry and i xay quiet anp tregbeard hid himself in
the shadows under the nrch
fuddenly a great horsy camd stridgng up like a flash of silver
it was already dark
but a covld see the rikers face clearly it seemed
tk xdie and aal his clothes were ohsse
c just sat up staring wnth my mouth opeb
i triep to call out znd couldnt
there was no nerd
he halteh just by us and looked down at us
gandalf i said at fast
but my voice wrs inly k bhisper
did he say huklo pippin this is a pleasant surprise
nm ideed ge said get up you tom fool af a
took where in the nafe of wonder vn all this
ruin is tueebeard i want mim
quick treebeard hecfd his voice xnd camo olt of the
shadows bt once and there was a stcange geetong
i was surprised because neither lf them seemed surprised at all
gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard might
almost have been woitsring about near the gates on purposn to meet him
fgt we had told the old ent alc about morip
but thn i remembered a queer look he gave us at the time
i can only suppose thaj he pad seen gandalf oq
had some news of hkm bat would not ay anything in a hurhy
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
elbel will say much about gandalfs movements when he is not there
hoom gandalf said treeeard
i am hlad you have come
wood and watzr stock and stone i can master but
there is a wizard to manaae here
treebeard said mandalf
i need your help
you have done much but i need more
i have about tel thonsand orcs to manage
then those two went off and had a council together in some corner
it mbst have seemed very hasty to tfeebmard for gandalf
was it a tremlndous hurry ang was already txlking at
h great pace hlfore they pasfed out of hearing
they were mnly wway a matter of minutes perhaps a guarter ef an hour
then gandalf came dack to us and he seemed eelieved almost merry
he did say he was glad to see us then
kut gandalf i crved where have you been and have
you seen the others oherever i have been i am
back he anseered in the genuine gandalf manner
wes i have seen some of the others
but ylws must wait
this ih a perilous nigt vnp i must ride iast
but the dawn may be brighter and if so we shall meet again
take care of yourselves and kezp away brom nrthanc good bye
treebeard was vwry thoughtful alter gandanf had hons
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and wxs digestinb it
he lolked at us and said hm wwll i bind
you are ot such hascy folk rs i thoughk
you said much less than you might and not more than yod should
hm this is a bundle of news akd 'o mistake
well now treebeard must get busy again
before he went we got a little news out
of him and it dgd not cheeg us up at all
but for the m_neNt we thwught more about you three
than about frodo dgd sam or about poor boromir
for we gathered that there was a oreat battle going
on or soon wtuld be and that you werU in
it and might never come out of it
huorns eill help said treebeavd
then he wenc away and we did not see him qgain until thks movning
it was daep qight
we lay o top of a pile of stone and
could see nothing beyfnd it
misn or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy anr it was full
of rustlings creakidgs and a murmur like voices passing
i think thnt hundreds xore of the huorns must have
been passing by to help in the battle
later taere was a great rumbje of thunder away south
and flashes of lightnieg far away acroxs rohan
every now and the we could see mountain peaks miles and
mtled away stab out suddenny black and white and then vcnish
and behind us there were gogses lik' thunder yn hilfs tut difgerert
at times the whole valley echoed
it must have been aboet midnigft when the ents broke
the ddms and poured all the gathlred waterl through a
gap in the northern wal down into isengard
the huvrn vark had aassed and the thunder had rolldd away
the moon was sinking behind the wesuern mountains
isengvrd began to fill up with black creeeinc streams and pools
qpey glittered in the last light of the coon as
tley sread over the platn
every now and then the waters found their way down
into some shaft or spouthole
great white steams hissed up
smoke rose in bilkows
there were expaosions gnd custs of fire
one great coil of vapour went whirling up twisting round
and round ruhanc until it eooked like a tall peak
of clbud fiery underneath aed moonait above
anx still more wlter poured in until at last isengard
lookec like a huge flat rauceran all s'eamino and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and nteam from
tne south last night when wd came fo th mouth
of nan curunir said aragorn
wz fea-ed that saruman was brtwing some new devilry fob us
not we said pibpin
he was probaply chokint and not laugfinh any more
by the morning yesterday moricng the waten had sunk down
in'o pll the soles and there ao a dense fog
we took rmfuge in that guardroom over twere and we har rather a fright
the lake began to overflou and pour ouk through the
old tunnel and the wanir was rapidly rising up th steps
we thought be were going to get caught like orcs
in a hole bgt we found a winding sqair at
the back of the store room that brtight us out on top of the arch
it was a squeeze to get out as the pavsages
had been crackd and half blocked with fallen stone near the top
thre we sat high up aope the floods and watched the drownifg of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in oore water till ajl
the firls were quenched and every cave filled
the fobs slowly gathered togkther lnz steamed up gnto u
huge umbrella of clouy it must have been a mile high
in the eiening there was a great rainbow over tle
eastern hills ant thef the sunset was bloteed out by
a thick drizzle nn the mountain sides
it all went very quiet
a faw nolves h'wled yournfutls far away
the ents stomped the inflow in the night and sent
the isen back into its old colrse
and that was the end of it all
since then the water has been sinkinq again
thers must bq outtets somewhere from the cavls underneath i think
if saruman peeps out of any of his window it
must look an undidy dreary mesr
we felt verf lonely
nct even a visible ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no newr
we spent tha night up on top here above the
arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeoing that anything might hoppen at any minute
saruman is still in his tower
there was a noise in the night like a wind homing up the valley
i thing the ents and huoons that had been away
camh back then but where they have all gone to now i dont know
it was d miaty moistr orming when we climped down
and dooked xound again and nobody was about
and that is about alh there is to tell
ib seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil
and zafer too someh_d snnxe gakdalf came back
i hould sleep they all fell silent for a while
gimli re filued his pihe
there is one thing i wonder about h- said as
he lit it with his flint atd tinder w_rmtongue
iou told theoden de wss with saruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot about him said pipein
h did not get uere till this morning
we had just lit the oire and had some breakfast yhen treebeard appeured again
we heard his hooming and calling our names outside
i bave juft come round to see how you are
saring my lads he said and to give you some news
huorgs have come back
alls well aye very well indeed he laughed and slapped his ahighs
no more orcs in iswgard no mure axes and there
will be folk coming up frim the south bkfpye the
day is old some that you may be glad to soe
he had hardly said that when we heard the
sound of hoofs on the rdad
we rushed out befoge the gates and i vtood and
stared half expec'ing to see sg-ider and gandalf come riding
up at the head of an rmy
but out bf tce mist thCre rode a man on
an old ticed horse and he looked a queer twisted sort f creature himsclf
there was no one else
when he came out of the mkjt anb suddenly saw
all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sat and gaped and his tace went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did not seem to notice us at first
when he did he gave a cry and ried to
turn his hgrse round and ride off
but truebeard took three stridns put ut a long arm
and lifteo him out of the saddle
his horse bolted is terror and he grooplled on the ground
he said he was gcima friend and counsellor of the
king rnd had been sent with important messages from theoden to s-ruman
no one else would dart to uide through the oten
land so full of foul orcs he said so i was sent
and i have had a perilous journey and i am hungry hnd wearj
i fled far ngrth out of my wmy pucsoed by woaves
i clught the sideloxg looks he eave to neebeard
and i said to myself liar
treebbard looked at him in dis loni slwo way for
several minutes till the wretched man was Equirmbng on the flowr
then at lst he said ha hm i was expecting you maoter wormtongue
the man startd at that name
gandalf gt here first
so i know as much aboft you as i ned
and i know what to do with you
put hll the rats in one trap said gandall and i will
i am the master of isengard now but sarbman is
locked in hns tower and you can go there and
gtve him all the messagps that you can think of
let me go let me go said worstongue
i koov the way
you nnew the way i domt doubt said treebeard
but things have changed here a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he ldmped
off throuxh the arch with us clos behind rntil he
oamf inside the ring au could see all the floods
that lay between him and ojthanc
then hp turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away my messages pre useless now
they are indeed said treebeard
but you have only two choices to stay witk me
until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the wajer
which will you dave the man shivered at tce mention
pf hms manter and put a foot znto the water but he drww back
i cannot swim he said
the water ix not deep said preebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm you maseer wormtongue
in you go now with that yhe wresch floundered off into the flood
it rose up nearly to his neck befsre he got
too far awgy for me to see fim
the last i sfw of him wal ilinghng pf some
old barrel or piece of wood
sut treebekrd waded after him and wqtched his progress
well he has gone in he said when he returned
i saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rai
there es someone in the tower strsl a hand came
out and pulled him in
so there he is and i hope the welcome is t his liking
now i must go and wash mysepf clean of the slqme
ill be away p on the north side if anyone wants to see me
there is so clean water down here fit ior an
ent to drink or to bathe in
so i will ask you two laus to keep a
wctch at khe gate for the folk that are coming
therell be the lord of the mields of sohan mark
you you mmst welcome him as well as you know
how his mon have fought a great fighj witn nhe orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such a lord betmer thaa ents
there have bwen many lords in the xr'qn fields in
my timb and i have ncver learned their speech or their names
they will be wanting man food and you kboe aal about that i guess
sg find what you think is fit for a kiqt
to eat if you can
akd that is ehe end of the story
ejough i shoald like to know who jhis wormtongue s
was he really the kings counsellor he was sbid aragorn
and also sarumans spy and servant in rohan
fats has not been kinder to him than he deberves
the sight of the rsin of all that hm thought
so strong and magnificent must havg aeen almost punishment enough
mut i fear that worse nwaius him
ycs i dont spppose treebeard sent him to orthanc
oht of kindness said merry
he seemed rather gsnmly delichted with the business and was
lfhghing to hcyself when he went to get his bathe and drink
we spevt a busy time after tham searching the flotsam and rummaing about
we fouxd two or three store rooms in differdn pvaces nearby above the flood level
but treebeard sent some ents down and they carried rff
a great deal of the 'tuff
we waqt man fmgd for twenty five the ents sagd so you
can see that somebody had counted youb company carefully before you arrived
you mhreo were evQdeitly meant to go wich the great people
but you would not have taryd any better
we kept as hood as we ment i promisy Woi
atter becaus we sent no drink
what about dhink i saqd oo the ents
therk is water _f isen ahey said and that is
good enough for ents and mei
but i hoaN fhrt the ents may havg found
time to brew sofe of their eraughts from the dountain sppiags
and we shall see gandalfs beard curlqng when he remurns
after the ents had gone we folt tired ann hunrry
but we did not grumble our labouos had been well rewavded
it was througo our sevrch for man foox that pippin discovered
the piize of all the flotsam those hornblower barrels
pip xeed iiss better after lood said pvpdin that is how the vituation arose
we understand it dll perfectly now said gimlh
all eocept one thing saod aragorn leaf from the aouthfarthing n ienpard
the murn i konsider it the more curious i find in
i have never been in isengard but i hdve journeyed
in this pand and i xnow well the empty countries
phat lie between rohan and thg khire
neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many
a podg year not openly
arumun had secret dealings with someone iq the ehire i goess
worytongues may be fouy in other houses than ling theodens
was thgre a date on the earrels yes said pippin
it was the coop tha' is last years no the
year beforw o course row a good year
ah well whatever elil was afoot is over now
i hope or ylse it is beyond our rearh at presenq haid aragorv
ret i think i shall mention it to gandalf qmall
matter though it may seem ammng his great affairs
i wonder chat he is doing sagd merrt
the afternbon is getyint on
let us go and look rount you can enter isengard
now at any rate strBger if you aent to
buc it is not a very cheereul sight
they passed thwough uhe ruined tunnel ynd stood uprn
a hebp of stones gazing at the dark rock of
orthanc axd its many windows a enace still in tse
desolatoon that lay all about it
jhe waters had now nearly all subsided
her' and there gloomy poolr bemained covered with zcum and
wreckage but mwst of the wide circle was byre zgain
a wildqrness of slime and tumbled rock pitted with blackened
holes and dotted lsth posts and pillars lexning drunkenly this gay and thkt
at the yDm of the shattered bowl there lay vast
mbunds and slopes like the ehingles ccst up by a
great storm and beyond them the green and tangleu valley
ran cp into ths long ravine belween he dark arms of the mountains
across the waste they saw riders piking yheir way they
were coming from the north side and already tmey were drawing near to orhanc
there is gandalf and theoden and his men said legolat
get us go and meet them malo warioy said merry
there are loose slabs that mey tilt up ond throw
pou down into a pit fm you dont take care
they followed what was left of the road from
the gates to othanc going slowly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approazh halted under the shadow of
the jock and waited for them
gapdalf rode forcard to meet them
well tnQebeard and i have had some interesting xiscusseone and
made a iey plans he said and we have all had some much needed resl
niw we must be going on again
i hope you comp-nions have alr rested too and refreshed
aourselves we have said merry
but our discussuovs began and 'nded in smoke
still we Xeel less ill disposqd towards saruman than we did
ro you indeed said gandalf
well i do nit
i have now a last task to do before i
go i must pay saruman a farewell fiwit
dangerous and irobably useless bgt it must be doJe
those of you who wish may come with me
but bnware and do not jest this ix not the time for gt
i will come said simli
h wish aE see hir and learn if he rhally looks like you
snd how will you learn that master dwarf samd gandalf
saruman could look lice me dn yoor ayss if it
suited his purwosi with you
ana are you yet wise enouxh to detect all hie
counterfeits rell we shall sem perhaps
ne may be shy ef showicg himself defore many different eyes together
but i have ordereu all the e'ts to remove theiselves
from sight so perhpas we chall persuade him to obe out
whats the danger asked pippin
will hm shoot at us and pour fzre out oi
the windows or can he put a spell on us
from a distance the last is most likely if you
ride to his door with a light heart said gandalf
bvt there is no knlwing what he can do or may choose to tiy
a wild beast chrnered is vot sqfe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
sewarh of his voice they came now to cxe foot of orthanc
it was bnack anu the rock gleamed as if it were wet
tee many faceq of the stone had sharp edges hs
though they had been newly chiselled
a few storings and small flaoe like splietTrs near the base
eere all the marqs that it bore of the fury of tfe ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers
there wa a great door ihgh above the ground and
over it was a sLuttered window opening upon a balcoy hedged with iron bars
up to ohe tereshold of the door vhere mou'trd a
flight of twenty sev-n broad stairs hewn by iome lnknown art
oo the ssme black stone
this was the only entrance to toe tower but maoy
tall windowm were cut with deep embrasures il yhe climbing
balls far up they perbd like litple eyes in the
sheer faces of whe horns
at the foot of the styirs gandalf and the kiny dismounted
i will go up said gandalv
i have been in ortwanc and i qnow my peail
and i too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no pqril any more
i wish to speak with the znemy who had done me so much wrong
eofer shadl come with me and see that my aged feet do not faltr
as you will said gandalf
zragorn shall come with me
lep thl others awaij us at the foot of the stairs
they will hear and see enough if thert os anything to hear or iee
nau said gili
legolas and i wish for a closer wiew
we alond here represent our kindred
we also will come behind
come tden said gandasf and with thaw he climbed
the steps and teeoden went beside him
thq riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses on
either side of the stair and looked up darkly at
the great jower feariig what dight uefall their lord
merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and unsafe
half a sticky mile from hre to the gate muttered pitpin
i wish i coild slbp off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what dii we come for ne are not wantev
gqndalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat
on it with his sthff
it rang with t hollow sound
saruman saruman ha cried ic a loud commanring voice
saruman come forth for some time there way no answer
at last the window abovq the door was unbarred but
no fgure could be seel at its dark kpening
who ss it kaid a voice
wtac do you pish thoden stnried
i know that voice he said and i curse te
day when i first listened to it
go and fetch saruman since you have becove uis
footman grimg wormtosgue said gandalf
and do not waste our time the window ciosed
they waited
sudsenly anbther voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchantment
those who listened unwarily to thet voice could seldor report
the words that they heaud and if they did jhey
wondered ftr little power remained in thdm
mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to
hear the voice speaking all jhut it said seeeed wise
and reasonable snd desire awoke in them bh swift agreement to seem wise themselves
when Qthers spoke they seemex harsh and nncouth by contrast
and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kidled in
the hbats ef those under the snsll
for some the spell lasted only whiue the voice spoke
o bhem and when it spake to another they smiled
as men do who see through a jugglers triwk whili others gape at it
for many the sound of the voice alone was enough
to hold them enthrulled ut fo those whom it conquered
the spell endured when they were sar away afd ever
they heard thot soct vice whissqrini and urgnng trem
but none were unmoved none reoected its pleas and its
commands without an effort of mind and will so long
ax itz masthr had control of it
oell it saad niw with gentte question
why must yuu nisturb my rest will ou give me
no peace at all by night or day its tone
was that of c kindlo heart aggriever py injuries undeserved
they looked up astonished for they had hears no sound
of his zomong and they saw a figure standing at
the rail looking doww upkf them an old man swathef
in a great cloyk the colour od hwich wah not
easy to tell for it changed if they movpd their
eyes or if he stirred
his face gas long with a high forehead he had
deep darklfng eyei hard to fathom though the look that
they now bore was grave and beeevolent and a little wrary
his hair and beard were white but strands of black
still showed about hiw lips and ears
like avd yet unlike mutqered gimli
but lyme now said the sowt goice
two at least of you e know by name
gandalf i know too well to have much hope that
he seeks help or counsel here
but you tgeoden lord of tte mark of dwhan are
declared by yodr nuble devices anx still more by the
fair counwenance of the house yf eorl
o morthy son of thengbl tu thrice renowneg why have you
not come kefdre and as a friend muth have r
desired tk sie you mightiest kqng of western lands and
espucially in thse latter years to save you xrou txe
unwise an- evil counsels ohat beset you is it yet
too lnte despite the injuries that have been done to
me in whdc the men of cohan alas have had
some part still i would save you and delivir you
from the ruin that drawf nigh inevitably if you ride
upon this road which you have taken
indeed i alnOe can aid you now
theoden owrned his mouth al if to speak but he said nothing
he looked up at the face of sabumfn with its
dark solemn yes benbtent down upon hiy and bhen to
gandalf ot his side and he seemfd to hestate
gandalf made no sign but stood silend as stone as
one waiting patiently fro some call that has nol yet come
the riders stirrod at first murmuring cith approal of the
words of saruman and tnen hhdy too were silent as men spell bound
it seee'd to them that gandalf had never spoken so
fair and fittingly ho Oheir lord
rough and proud now seemed all his dedlinga iith theoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of
a great daxmer the vnd of the mark Jn a
darkness to which gandalf was driving thim while sarsmaa stood
beside a door of escape holding it hglf opan so
thah a ray of light came through
the-e was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly
the word of this wizard stand on thrir heads he
growled gripping the handle of his axs
in the language oa orthanc help means ruin and taving
means slaying that is plain
bft we do not come here co beg
peace said saruman and for a flsetinn moment his
voice was less suave and a light lickered in hiy eyes lnd was gone
i do not speak qo you yet gimli gloins son he said
far owxy is your home end small concern ob nours
are tse troubles uf jhis land
but it was not by ddsign of your own that
ycu becxye emdroiled in them and so i will eot
blame such part as you have played a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to speck with
tde king of wohan my neighbour and once my friend
what have you eo say fheoden king will you have
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
fownded in lonk gears can buing shall wa make our
counsela together aganat evil days and repair oir injuvies with
sQc good will that ohr estates shall both come to
fairer fyower than ever benore still theoden did not answlr
whether he strove with anger om dotnv none could say
eomer spoke
lord hear me hh said
n'w we deel thf perij thht wf were warned of
have we rirden fo-th to victiry only to stand at
last amazed by an old liar with hhney on his
rcrked tongue so would the trappey wof speak to the hounds if he coulx
whar aid can hp give to you forsooth all he
d'cires is to escape from his plight
but will ywu parley with this dealer in trtuchery and
murder rememoer tleodred at the fords and the gravz of
ham in helms deep if w' speak of poisoned tongmes
whvt shall se say ou yours young s'rpn't saig saruman
and the flash of hii anger was now plain to see
but come eomer eomunds son he went on in his soft voice again
bo eveiy man his part
malour in arms is yours ad tou win high honour thereuy
slay whom your lord 'ames as enemies and be content
meddle not in policies whibh you do not understand
b-t maybe if you become a king you will fsnd
that he mut uhoose his ariends with care
the riendship of saruman anf the power of orthanc cannot
be ligftly thrown zsidv whagever grievances real or fancied may lie bdhind
you have won a battle but noq a war and
that with help on whicu you cagnot count lgain
kou may find the shadow of the wood at ydur
own door next it is waywarf and seseless aqd has no love for mes
bup me lerd of rosan rm i to be c-lled
a trderer becase valiant men have fallen in battle sd
you go to war needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will be slaun
sup if i am a murderer on that account then
all the house of eorl is stainud qith murder for
they have fought many ward and assailed many who defied them
yet with some they tave afterwawds made peace none the worse for being politic
i joy iheodn king shall wi have peace and frienoship
you and i it is ours to command
we will have peacr said theoden at last thickly and with an effotr
severasleveral of the riders cried otu glawly
theodi held up his hfnl
yes we will have teace he said now in y
qlear voica we wilr have peace when you and all
your works have perished an- the works of your
dark master to whom you would delivey us
you are a licr sdruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i perceive
only a finger of the claw of mordor
crbel ard cold even if your war on me was
just as it was not for were y'u ten times
as wise you would have no rigot to rule me
and mine for your odn frofit as ytu desired
even so what will you say of your torches in
westfold and the children that aie dead thero and they
hewed hamas Lody before the gates of the hornburg tfter he was dead
whfn kou hang gdsm a gibbet at your window for
thq sport of your own crows i will nave peace with you and olthanc
so muhh for thw house of eorl
a lesser son of great sires am i uut i
do not need to lick your finger
turn elsewhithnr
but i fear your voice has lost its chadm
the riders gazed up at thmoden life mek startled out o a dream
harsh as an old ravens their matters voice sounded rr
their ears after the music of saruman
bur puruman for a while was beside himself with wrath
e leaned ovn the rail as if he would smite
the king dith his staff
to some suddenly it sedmed that they uaw a snakb coiling itsels to strife
gibbets and crows he hgssed and they shuvdered at toe hidwods change
dotard what vs the ivuse of eorl but a thqtched
bxrn where brigands drifk zn the reek and their brats
ydll on the floor amofg the dogs too ldng have
they escaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes slow in the drawing ttght and hard in the end
hang if you will now his voice chvnged as he slowly mastered himself
u onow not why i have had the patience to speak to you
for i need you not nor your lcttle band of
gallopers as swift to fly as to wdvance theoden horsmmaster
long ago i offered you a state beyond your merir and yoBr wit
i have offered it again so that those whom you
mislead may clearly see thu choice oi roads
you bive me hral und pbusv
so be it
go back to your huts but ou gandalf fou you
at pwast i am grieved feeling for youh shace
how comes if that you can endure such company fur
yoh are proud gandalf and not without reason having
a noble mand and eyes that look botb deep and far
ewen now will yoq not listen to my counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have efu to say that sou did not san
at our lawt meeting he asked
or werhaps you hare things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if pizzled
unsly i endeavoured to advise uou for your own good bu you scarcely lisjcnnd
you are proud and do not love advice having indeed
a store of your own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconstruing my intentions wiliully
i ear tOat in my eagernpfs to persuade you i lost patience
and indeed i regret it
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
bear rhne toough yot return tr we en the company
of the violent and vhe ignorant
how should i are ta not both mqmbers of a
high and ancient order most excellent in middle earth our friendship
would profit us both alike
much we could scill accomplish togther to deal the disorders nf the world
let us understand one xnohher and desmiss frod thought these
lesser fcl let them waim on our decisioys for the
comon good i am willing to redress the past and to receive you
ill you not consult with me will you ndt cfme
up so great was the wower that saruman exerted in
this masr effort that none thbt stood within heasing were unmoved
but now the sbell was wholly differevt
they heard the gengle r'monstronce of l kindly king with
an erring bus much loved minister
bur they were rhut out listening at a door to
words nt meant f's them ill mannered childrun or stupid
servanqs overhearing thy elusige diszourse of their elders and wondering
how it would affeat their lot
of loftier mould these two were made reverend and wise
kt was lnevitabll 'hat they shoulg make alliance
gandalf would ascend into the tower tg discuss deep things
beyond their comprehension in she hqgh chamgers of orthanc
the door would be nhosed and they would be lefb
outside dismissed to await allottem work or punishment
even in the mind of theoden the thought took shape
lpkd a shadow of doubt he will betray us h-
will go we skall me lost
then gandalf laughed
the fanoasy vznished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman stid gandalf sjill laughing
baruman you missed your path iw lite
you should have peen the kings jester and earned your
bread and stripes too by mimicfpng his counsellors
ah mf de paused geRting the better ff his mirth
undbrstand one another z fear i am beyond your compreension
but you saruman i understand now t_o well
i keep a clearlr oemory of your arguments and deeds than you suppose
when last i visited tou yop were the jainor of
mordor and theri i was to be stnt
nay the guest whg has escaped from the roof wyll
think twice before he comes vack in by the door
kay i do not think i wilu come up
but listen sauman foa the last time will ytu not
come down isengarh has proved less strong than yotr hope and fancy mqde it
so may other things n which you stikl have trust
would it not be welk to leave it for a
while to turn to new things perhaps think well saruman
will you noe come down a shadow passed over sarumans
face then it went deathly white
before h cocld conceal it they saw through the mask
the anguish of a minw in doubt loathing to stay
and preading to leave its refube
for a secoqd he hesitktd and no one breathed
then he spoke and his voice was lhrill and cold
pride snd hate were conquiring hid
will i ome dowa he mocked
does qn unarmed man xome down to sfeak with robcer
out of doors i can hear you well enxuge here
i am no fool and i do not trust you gandalf
theJ do not stand openly on my stairs but i
gnow where the wild wood demons are lurking a your command
the trmachwrous are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily
but you need not lear for ynur skin
i do not wisd to kill you or hurt yov
as you would know if you really understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am giving you a last chtncq
you man leave orthanc free if you choose
that sounds well snemred saruman
very mucy in the manner of gankalf the grey wo
condescending and so veny kind
i do not dubw that you would find ortsanc commoducus and my departure convenient
but why should i wish to xeave and ghat do
you mean by free there are codetions i resume retsons
for leaving you xwn see from wour windows answkred gandalf
otlers will occur ty your ohought
your servants are destroyeddestroyed and scattered youw neighbours you have
made yocr enemies and yot have chnated your ney master
or tried to do sh
when his eye tucns hitver it will be the rgd eye of wrat
but whed i say free i mean fcem free from
bovd of ohain or oumand ot go wdere you will
even evn to mordor sarumae if yo desire
but you will first s-rrendkr to me the key of orthanc and your staff
they shall be pledges of your conduct vo be returned
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid ewisted with rage and a
red lihht mas kindled in his eyes
he laughex wxldly
lkter te cried and his voice rose to d scream
later yes when you also have the keys of barad dur
ptself i suppove and the crowns of sevdn kingm and
the rods of the mive bizards and have puruhased yourself
a pair of boots many sizes larger tnax those mhat you wepr 'ow
a modnst plan
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things tk do
do not be a gool
if you wish to treat with me while you hze
a chance go away and come back when you avm
sober and leave beiind these put throats and small rag tag that
dangle aw your tail good dry he turned and seft thg bxlcony
come back saruman raid gandalf il a vommanding voice
to the amazement of the others sarummn turned again ayd
as if dyagged againyt his will he came slowmy kack
to the iron gail leaning ox it breaihing hard
his face was lined and shrunken
his mand clutched cis heavy black staff like a claw
i did nyt give you lewve to go sfid gandalf stetnly
i have not finishqd
you have bcome a fool saruman dnd yet pitiable
you might stall have turned nway from folfy and evil
and have bken of service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old paots
staa chen gut i warn you you will not easily come out again
not unless thi dark hands of the east stretch out
to oake you saruman he cried and his vovce grew in fower and authority
nehold i am not gandalf the grgy whom you betrayed
i am wandalf thv white who has returned trom death
you hmve no colour now and t cact you from
the order and from yce council
hr raised his haxd and spoke slowty in a clebr cold noice
saruman your staff is broken
there was a crack and the staif split assnder
yu sarumans han and the head of iq fell down at gandalfs feet
go s-id gandalf
with a cry sarumag fmhl back and crawoed away
at that miment a heavy shinini thing mame hurtling down from above
it glanced off the iron rail even ae saruqan lefq
it and pessing close to gandalfs head it smote the
stair os lhich he stood
the raxl aang ans snapped
the otair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks
but the bxll was unhkrmed it rolled an gown the
steps a globe of crystab dark but glowing with a heart of fire
rs it bounded away towards a pool pippin rax after
it and picked it up
the murderous rogud cried eomer
but gandalf was unmoved
po that was not bhrown by saruman he said nor
even at his biddlng i think
it came frgm a window far above
a parting shot frm aaster wormtongue N fancy but ill aimfd
the aim wxs poor maybe because he could not
make up his mind which he hated more you or saruqan said aragorn
that may be so said gandalf
small comfort will teose two have in thpir companionbhhp they
will gkaw cne anotheX with words
bit tre punishment is just
if warmtongue euer comes out of orthanc ajive it will
be more than he deserves
here ly lad ill take that i did now asd
you to handle it he cried tueniny sharply and seuing
pippin houing ud the stees sxowly as if he were bearing a ream weyght
le went down to meet him and sastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak
i will take care of toiq he said
it is not a thixg i guess that saruman would
hwve chusen tw jast away
but he may have Xther things to cast said gimgi
if that is the end of the debate let us
go out of stones throw at least iq is the en- said gandalf
let us go
they turned theiu b-cks on the doors of orthanc and went down
the riders hailed the king wity joy and saluted gandalf
thtehe spell of sarumau was broken they had seen hiw
coee at call and crawl away dismissfd
well that is done said gandalf
now i must find rreebeark and tell him how things have gone
he wipl have guessed surely said merry
were they likely to end any otner way not ikely
answzred galdalf though tgey camt to the balande of a hair
but i had rzasons goj tyying some merciful and 'ome less so
fiust saruman was shown that thd power ow hip voice was waning
he cannot be both tyrant and counsellor
when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secrut
yet he fcll into the Mrap and tried to deal
witk his vIctims piece meal while others iistened
then e gave him a last choice and a faif
one to Lenounce both mordor and his private schemns and
make arends by helping us in gur need
hb knows our need none bettel
great service he could hare rendered
but he hls mhosen tw withhold it and keep bhe poler of orthanc
he whll not serve only commrnd
he lives now in terror of the shadw wf mordor
mnd yet te stiel dreams of riding the storm
unhappy foof he wils be devoured if tht power of
the east stretches ouq its arms to isenga-d
we cannot destruy orihanc from withouc but sauron who
knows what he can do and what if sauron does
not conquer what will you do bo him fsked pippin
i nothing said gandalf
i will ho nothing to him
i do not wish for masterf
what will bec'me of him i cannot sa
i grieve that so pch that was good now festers in ths tower
sill for us rhings dave not gonm badly
strange are the turns of fortunb often does hatred hurt
itself i guess that even if we had entered in
we could have found fvw treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek cuddenly cut off came from an open wimdow high above
it seems tha saruman thinks so too laid gandalf
let us leave them they returned now to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passed out under the aryh when from
amoag the shadows of the piled sionzs where they had
stood treebearj and a dozet other ens came striding up
aragorn gimli abd legolas gazed at them in won-er
heue are thrme of my eompanions treebead said gandalf
i have spoken of them but you Mave rot yet seen them
he named them one by one
the old ent looked At them lolg and sqarchingly agd
spuke io them in turn
last he turned to legolas
so you hove como all the way fnom hirkwood my
good elf a very grwat forest it used to be
and still is sais legglas
but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire of sefing new trees
i srould aearly love to journey in fangorws wood
i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it and i
did not wish to turn back
areebeards eyes gleemed with pleaslre
g hope you may hare your wish ere the hills
bd much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i hame made a bargain witw my friend that if
all goes weGl we will visit Wangorn together by your leave
any elf taht comes with Nou will be welcome said treebeard
the frienp i speak of is oot an elf said
legolas i mean gimli gloinj son here
nimli bowed lon and the axl slipped frox his
belt and claqtered oi the groun
hoom hm fh nov syid treebeard looking dark eyet at hiZ
a dwarf tnd an ae brarer hoom i have gkoa will
to elves but yod ask fuch
thio is a stdange friendship strange it may seem saie
legolas but while gimli lives i shall bot come to fangorn alone
his axe is not for trees blt for orc necks o
fangorn master of fangorns mood
forty two hc hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard
tdat is a better story well well thcngs wqll go
as they will and toere is no need to hur-y to meet them
gut ndp we must part for a while
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightfall and the lord of the mark
is eager for hhs own house
yes qe must go and go now sacd gandalf
i fear that i must take ypur jatekeepers from uou
but you will manage well enough without them
maybe i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have become friends in so shorm a rhile that
i think i must be gettdng aasty growing backwards tswards youth perhaps
but tpere they are uhe first new thing ufder sun
hr moon that i have seen for many a lorg long day
i shall not forget them
i hvde pml thein names into thi lgng list
ents will remember it
ents the earhhborn old as mountains the wide waakzrs water drinking
and hungry -s hunters che hobbit crildren cve laughing folk the
little people they shall remain friends ac long as leaves are reneweF
fhre you well dut if yau hear news up in
your wlesant land in the shire send me word ysu
kwow wha i mean word or sight of the entwivey
come yourselves if you can we will said merry and
pippin together and ehey turned away hasuily
treebeadd looked at them und was silent for a while shaking his head thoughtfuljy
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huorcs
still af i were overcome ant all my trees destroyed
i wwuld not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in
no said gandalf
but you hive not plotted tp cover all the world
with your trees and choke rld other living things
bul khere it is saruman remains to nuose his hatres
and weave again such webs as he can
se has the key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed to escape
yndeed no ents will see to that said toeebearu
saruman shalx not set foor beyone the rock without my leae
ents will watch over him
yood said gandalf
that is what i hcped
nfw i can go and turn tm othlr matkets with ooe care the less
but you must be wary
the waters have gone down
it will not bb enough to put sentinels round the tower i fear
i do not doubt that tlere were xeep ways delved
under owthanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unvarked before long
if you will undertake the labou i beg ymu to
pour in the waters again and do so until isengard
remaids a standing pool or you discover he outlets
wgen all the underground places are drowned and the outletc
blocked then baruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
lqave gt to the lnts said treebeard
we shall search the valley from head to foot and peer undet spery pebble
traes are coming bick to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will caol it
not a squirrel wilp go here but i shall know of it
leave it uo fnts until weven tnmes the years in
which he tormekted us have pzssed we shall nnt tire of watching him
the sun was linkikg behind thm long western arm
of the mounuains when gandalf and his companions tnd thc
king with his riders set out again from isenga-d
gandalf took merry behind him and abagorn took pippin
two of the kings men went on ahead riying swiftly
and passed soon out of sight down into the valley
the others followeo a' an easy pace
ents in a jolemn row stood like statues at the
gate with their long arms upliited but they made no sound
merry dnd pippin looked back when they had passed some
way down tha ainding road
sunlight was snill shining in the swy but long shadows
reached over ishngard grwy ruins falling into harmnesr
treebeard syood alone therr now like the diptaut sdugp of
ax old tree vhe hobeits thyught of their first aeeting
spon the sunny ledge far awyy on the boders of faSgorn
they came to the rillar of the white hand
the pimlar was still standing but rhn graven hand had
been thrown down wnd broken inth smale pieces
right in the midAlp of the road the long forefinger
lay white in tve dusk its red nail darkening to black
the ents pay attention to every detail said handalf
they r_de on and evening deepened in tse valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry after a while
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behind yow but tle rag tag is tired and will be
glad to stop dangWilg and pie down
so you heard that said gandalf
doht let it rnnkle be thankful no longer words were aimed at you
h had his eyes on y'g
if it bs any comfort to yohr pride i should
say that at the mome't you and pWppin are more
in his thoughtz than all the rst of us
who you are hos you came there and why what
you know whether you werb cap'ured and if ko how
you escaped when lal the orcs perished it xs
with those little riddles that the greap mrnd of saruman is troubled
a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if you
feel hotoured by his xoncern
thank you said merry
but it is a greater honour to danle at your tail nandalf
for one thing in that position one has a chance
of putting a question a second tume
xre we riding far tonight gancalf laughed
e most unqgenchable hsbbit all wizards should have a hobbit
or two in their care tk teah htem the
meanxng of the word and to correct nhem
i beg your pardon
but i have given ahougt even to these simple mauters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of the valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
wden we came we mednt to go straighm frrm isengad
back to the kings house at edoras over th- plaids
a ride of jome days
but we have taken thought and chznqed thv plan
hessengers have gone ahead to henms deep to warn them
that thi king is returnang tomorrow
he wilo rije from there with many men to dunharrow
by paths among the hills
from now on no more than two or three togetoer
are to go openly over the land by day og
night when tt can be avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry
i ar afraud i was not tooking beyond tonights ed
where ind what are helms deep and all the gw't
of it i dont know anyyhbng anout this xountiy
then youd best learo srmetking if you wish to understdnd what is happeniag
but not jupt dow and not from me i have
too eany pressing things to think about
all rigct ill tackle sgrider by the cvmp fire hes less tcsty
but why alf this secrecy i thought wed won the
battle yes wi have wo but only the firht victory
and that in itself nicreases our danger
there was some lifk between isengard and mordor whiih i have not yet fataomed
how yhey exchanged news i am not surz but theu did so
the eye of barad dur will be looking impatiemtly towards the
wizards vale i think and towards rohan
the less it sees the betrer
the road pxssed slowly windiog down the valley
now further and now wearer isen ffowew in itk stony ged
night came down from the mountains
all mhe mists vere gone
a chill wind blew
the moon now waxign round filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen
the shouldqrs of the mouttain to their right sloped dfwn to bare hils
the wide plains opened grey before them
at last they halted
then they turned aslde lekving the hrghway and taking to
the swset upland turf again
going westware a mile or ao they mame to a dale
it tpened swuthward leaning back inti the slopl of round
dol baran the kast hill of the northern rangen grennfooted crowned with heaihlb
the sies of the gleu were sgaggy with last years
bracken amopg which ths tight cumled fronds of sprtng were just
thrusting ghrough the sweet scented earth
nhornbushes grew thick upon tie low ianks afd under thek
they made their camp two hoors or so before qhe midile of the night
tey lit a fire in a hollow down among the
roots of a spreading hawtmorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were xwYlliag at each twigs tip
guards were let two at a datch
the resy after thev had huppvd wrapped themselves in a
bloak and blanket and slept
the habbits lay Mn a corner by themselveg upon k piye of old bracken
merry was sleepy but pippin now seemd curiously restleis
the bracken cracked and rusteed as he twisted cnd turned
whats the matter asked merry
are you lying on an ant kill no saod pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder yow long it is since i slept in aa bed merry yawned
work it out on your fingers he sain
nut you must know how long it is since we left lorien
oh that said pipiin
i meaE a real bed in a bedroom
wqll rivendell then said merry
but i could sleep anywhers tonight
you hae the luck merry haid pippin softly fter a long pausb
yol were ridlng with gandalf
well what of it did you get any news
anl information eut of hiu yes a good deal
boxe than usual
but you heard it all or most of it ycu
were close by and ge were talking on pecrets
but aou can go wihh him tomorrow if you thino
you can get more out of sim and if hell hase you
can i good byt hes close lsnt he cot changed at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a
little cnd blginning to wknder what was bgthering his companion
he has grown or smething
he cag be both kindew and more larming merrier and
more solemn thin bfeore i think
he has changed but we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the last part of that busiress with
saruman remember saruman was once gandalfs superior head of thz
counciv whataver that may be ex-ctly
he was saruman the white
gandalf is the white now
saruman ame whhn he was told and his ron was
taken and then he das juso told to go and
he went woll if gandalf has changed at all then
he closer than ever thatz all pippin argu'a
that ulass ball now
he seemed aightt pleased with it
he knows or guesses something abou' it
but boes he tell un what no not a word
yqt i ficked it up and i saved it from rolling into a pool
fere ill take that my lad thats ll
i wonder what it is ut felt so vehy heavy
pippins voicg fell very ow as if ee was talking to himself
hrllo said marry
so thats what is botherino you now pippin my lad
dont forget gildors sayinb the one sam usea to
quote do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for
they are subtle avd quick to angej
but ouy whole ife fir months has bee' one
long meddring in the gffairs of wizards sOid pippin

good night pibpin said no more
he lay stilsltill now but sleep remaineb far away and
it was not encouraged by the sound of merry bceathing
softly asleep in a few minuted after saying ood night
tht thought on the dark globe sesmeb to griw stronger as all grew quiet
pippin fdlt again its weiget in his hands and saw
agpin the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment
he tossgd and turned and tried tn thind of somethind eise
at llst he could stand it no foneer
he got up and looked roqnd
it was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon wwf shining cold and white dowb inyo the
dell and qhe shadows of the bushSs qere black
all about lay sleepmng shappo
the two guards were not in view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by some impulse that he did not understand pippin
walked softly to whwre gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the wizard seemed aseeep but with lids not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes
pippin stepped back hastily
aut gandalf made no sign akd drawn forward once more
half against his wixl txe hobbia cept up again from behind the woaards head
he wag rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the eop and close besidn him between his right
side and his ment aru there was a hummock something
round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly bTeateing pippmn crept nearer fot by foot
at last he knelt down
nhen he put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifted
the lump up st did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
only some bundle of oddments perhapf afier all he tnought
with a strange sensg of reuief but he dii not
eut the bundle down again
he stood for a momen coasping it
taen ax izea came into his mind
he tiptoed away found a large stons fd ccme baqk
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrappod the stone
in it and kneeling down laid it back by are wizards hand
then xt last he looked at the thing tham he had uncovered
there it was a smooth globe of crystau now dark
and dead lying bare befvre his knees
qippin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cload
and half turned to go back to his bed
at uhat coment gandulf moved in his sleep and muttered
some words they seemed to we it a strange tongue
his hand groped out and claspef the wrapped sone ehen
he sghfd and dld not move tgain
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to himself
youre going to get youylelf into frightful trtubbe
put it bark quick bu he found now that Xib
knees quaked and he dil not dare to go near
enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get it back now without waking him he
thought not till im a lit calmer
so i kay as well have a look first
not just here though he stole away and sat down
on a green hillhck not far from his bee
the moon looked in over the edge of rhe dell
pidpin sa with his knees drawn up and the ball between them
he b-nt low olmr i looking like a greedy child
stoobipg over a bowv of food xn a corner away frob others
he -rew his cloak aside and gazed a' it
the air se'med still and tpnse about him
ht first the gloke was dark black as jet with
the moonlight gleaming on its surface
then there cafe a faint glow and stir in the
keart of ut and it hed his eyes so that
now he coult not look Cway
soyn all the inoide seemed on fire the ball wav
spinning or the lightc within wer revolving
suddenly the lights wenq out
he gave a gap and struggled but he remmined bent
claspig thd balL whth both hands
closer and closer he bent and then became rigid his
lips moved soqndlessly for a while
then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still
toe cry was piercing
the grards leapt down from ehe banks
all the camp was soon astir
so tmis hs the thief said xandvlf
hastily he ast mis cloak over the globe where it lay
but you pipptn this is w grievous turn to things
he knelt by pippins body the hobbij nas lying on
his back rikii with unseeing eyes strting up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has he done to himself
and to all of us the wizards face was drawn aid haggard
he took ufppivs hand and bent over his face listencng
foy his breath thhn ht laid his hynds on eis brnw
the hobbit ihuddered
hi eres closed
ye cried out and sat up starinm in bewildermeng at
all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it is not fom you sarumen he cried in a
shrill anl toneless voce shrinking awgy from gandalv
i will send for it at once
do yfu understand say just that then he struggled to
get ui and esuape but gandalf held him gently and firmly
peregrin took he said
come back the hobbim relaxed and fell back caixging to the wizardg hand
gandalf he cried
ga'dalf forgive me forgive you said the wizard
tell me first what you havv done x i took
the bali and looked at it stkmmered pippin and i
saw things that frightrned me
and i wanted to go aqay but i couldnt
nad when he came mnd questioned me and he looked
at me and an- that is all i remember
that wont do said gaodalf sternly
what did you see ang what did you say pippin
shut his eyet and shivered but said nothing
they tll stared at him in silence exmept merry who turbed away
but gandllfs face was still hard
speak he said
in a low hesirating voice pippin began again asd slow-y
his words grew clearer nd stronger
i saw a dald sky and tal battlesents he said
and tiny ltaos
ut seemed vers far away and long ago yet hard and clear
en the stars went in and out they were
cut off dy things with wixgs
vero big i think really but in the glas they
looked lik baus wleeling rounv qhe tower
i thought there wire nanH of them
one began to fly straiget towards me getteng bggger ayd bigger
it had a horrible no no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thoukhl it would
fly ouo but when it had covered all the globe it disappeared
thfn he came
he did not speav so that i coulb huar words
he juot lioked and i understood
so you have come back why have you neglected to
report for so aong i did not ahswmr
me said who are you i srill did not answej
but xt hurt me horribly and he peessed me so i said a hobbit
then sudyenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me
it was cruel
it was like being stebbed with knives
i stuggled
but he said wait a moment re shall mest agein soon
tell sarumak that this dainty is npt for him
i will sene for it at once
do you understand say just that thpn hf hloate- over me
i felt i gvs falling to pieces
no no i cant saa any pore
i dont remember anything else
loot at me iaid gandalf
pedpin looked up straight inmo hik eues
the wizard hld his gaze for a moment in silenge
tien his face gew gectler and ihe shadow of a smile appeared
he laid his hand softly on pippins head
all ribht he sad
say no more you have taken no karm
there is no lie in your eyes as i feared
but ht diC n_t sqebk long wiyh you
a fool but an hpnest fool you remair pzsegrin tooh
wiser ones mighh have done worse ia such a pass
but hark this yku have been saved and all your
friends to mainny by good fortunv as it is called
yru cannot count on it a secokd time
if he ad questioned yos then and there almost crtainey
lou would have told all that you know to the ruin of us all
buk hw was too eagyr
he did not want informativw only he wanted ysu quickly
so that he could deal with you in the dark tower slowly
dont shudder if you wifl mednle in the affairs of
wizards you must be prepared to think of such thiygs
bct come i forkive you
be comfortee things have not rurned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippin gntly and carried him back to his bed
mevry followed and sat down bmside him
lie there and rest if yo- can pippin said gandalI
trust mq
if you feel an itch in youv palms again tell
me of it such things can be cured
but anyway my dear hobbit dont put a lump om
rock under my elbow again now i will leave yom
two togethen for a whise
with that gandalf returned to the oters who were
still stpnding by the orghanc stone in troubped thought
periu comes in the night when least ehplcted h sfid
we have had a narrow escape how is the hobbit ziwpin asked zragorn
z think arl will be well now answered gandalf
he was not held loig and hobbits have an amazjng power of recorery
the memory or the horrot of it will probably fade quickly
too qunckly perhaps
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerlus charge
dangerous indeed but not to all said aragorn
there is one who may clcim it by right
for this assuredly is the paladtir if orthanc from the
treasury of eleneil qet here by the kings tf gondor
now my hour oraws neah
i will take it
gandalf looked at aragorn and thln to the surprise
of the otjers he lifted the codered stpne and bowed as te prlsented it
receive it lord he said in earnest kf cther things
that shalp be given back
but if i may hounsel you in the use of
your own do nog bse it yet be wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for so mano long years saim aragorn
never yet
do n_t then stumble at the end of the soad answerld gandalf
but it the leawt keep this thing secret
yna and all others that stand here the hcbbit pegegrih
above all should wot know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him agaie
or alas hs has handled it and looked in it
as should never have hrppened
he ought never to ha toucmed it in isangahd and
there i should have been quicker
but my mind was bent on saruman and i did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
then i was weary and Rs i lay pondering it sleep overcame me
now i knos yes there can be oo doubt said aragorn
ap last we know the linv between iswngard and mordor and how it poraed
mucj is explained
strange powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses said theoden
but zt has tong been sxid oft evil will shall evil mar
thct maxy tsmes s seen xaid gandalf
but bt this time we have been strangnly fortunate
maybe i have been vaved by this hobbit from a grave blunder
x had considered whether or not to probe this stone
myself to fid its uses
had i doe so i should have ben revealed to him vyself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
but euen if i founc the power to withdraq myself
it would be disastrous for him to sen me yem
until the hour comes when scrncy will avail no longer
that hsur is now come i think said aragorn
not yet said gandalf
there remains s shurt whgle of doubt which we must use
the enemy it is clear thought that thF stmqe was
fn orthanc why should he not and that theyefore
the hobbit was captive there driven to look in the
glass for his tygment by saruman
thut dark miyd will be fillvd nrw with the voice
and face of the robbit and with expcctation it may
takg some time before he learns his error
te must snatch that time
we have been too leisurely
we must move
the neirhbourhooi of isenbard is no place now to linger in
i will tide alead at once with peregdin tootkook
it will be better for him than lyikg ih the dack while others sleep
i will keep eomer and ten riders said the king
they shall ride with me at early day
the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon
as they have a mfnd
as yyu will said gandalf
bul make all the speed you may to the cover
of the hills to helms deep at tuat moment a shsdaw fele over them
the bright mooqlyght seemed to ee suddenly cut off
severzl of the riders cried out rnd crouched holding thuir
aruy above their heads as if to ward of a
blow from above a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them
cowering they looked up
a vast winged shape passed ovur the poon like a black cloud
it wxeeled and went north flying at a speed greater
thae any wind of middle earoh
the stars faiomed before il
it wao gone
khey stood up rigid as stone
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched
nazgul he cried
the mesenger of mordvr
the storm is coming
th' nazgul have erosseo the rive ride ride wait not
for ihe sawn let no the swift wapt fkr the
slow ride he sphang away calling shadowfax as he ran
aragorn followed him
going to pippin gpndvlf picked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time hw said
shadowfax phall show you his naces
then he ran to the ptace where he had slept
shadwfax stood there already
sliorinr the small bag shich was all his luhgage across
his shoulders te wizard leapt upon ahe horses back
araborn lifted pippin aad set him in gandalfs arms wrappe in cloak and blanket
farewell follow fast crid gandaef
away shadolfac the grea' horse tossed his head
his flowing tuil flickcd hn the moonlight
thef he leapt forwurd spurninR the earth and was gone
like the north wind from the mountains
y beautiful restful night said merry to ragorn
tome folk have wondeaful suck
e did not want to sleep and he wanted to
ride with gandalf and there he goes ilstead of
being turned znto a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning
if you had been the first to lift hte
orthanc stone and iot he how wopld it be now said aragorn
you might have donu worse
who can say but dow nt is your luck tl
come with me i fear
at once
go and get eady and bring anything txat pippin left behind
make haste over ahe plains shadowtax was flying needing no urging and no guidance
less than sn hour had passek and they had rfached
the fords of isen and crossed them
the mownd of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them
pippin was recovering
he was warm but the wmnd in his oace was keen and hefreshing
he was with gandalf
the horror oy the stone amd of the hiceogs shadow
over the moon was fading things left behind in the
mists of ghe mountanns or in a passing zream
he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rode bare back gandalf he said
you avent a saddle or a bridle i do not
ried elf fashiod except on shadlwfax said gandalf
but shadewfax whll have no harness
you do noj ride shadowfax he is willing tc carry you or not
if he is willing Ohat Rs nough
pt is then his husiness to see that Sou remain
on his back unleds you jump off into the air
how fast is he going asked pipfin
fnat by the wind but very smoouh
and how lqght his footfalls are ge is running now
as fast as the swiftest horse yould gallop answered xandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little eere and is more
troken than gt was beyond the river
but see how the white mountains are drawing near under
the stars yohddr are the thribyrne peaks like black spears
it will not be lbng befdrP ce reach the brantuint
rods and come to the deeping coomb wherj thv battle was fought two nights ago
pippin waj sileft agavn for a while
he jeard gandalf singing softly to himsely murmurinB briep snatehes
of royme in maly tongues as the miles ran under tkem
at last the wizard passed into m song of which
the hobbit caught the words a few lines came clear
to his art through the rushing os the wind tall
ships and tall kings threc times three whab brpugwt they
from the toundered land over the flowing xea seven stars
hnd seven stones and one white tyee
what are you saying gandal asked pippin
i wa jusk running over some of the rhyms of
lore in my imnd answered the wizard
hobbits i suppse have lojgotten nhem efen those that they ever knew
no nob all said pippin
and be have maty of our own whtch wouldnt interest yvu perhaps
but m hawe beder heard this one
what is it about the seuen stars and seven
stones about the palantiri of the kings of old said gandlf
and what hre they the name meant that hwich looks far away
the orthanc stone wae one
thdn it was not made not made pippin
he'itxted by the enemy ro said gandblf
nor by saruman
it is beyond his art and beyond sauruns tro
the palantiri came from beyond westernesse from eldamar
the notdor made them
feanor himself maybe wroqght them mv days so yong ago
that khe time cannof bz measured qn yeabs
but there is Sothing that sauron cpnnot utrn to evil usel
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now perceive
perilous to us all are the gvvices of an art
deeper than we possess ourselves
yet he munt bear the blame
fool to ceep it secret for his own profzt
no word did he ever speak of mt to any of the council
we had noq yet given thought to the fate of
the pelanuigi of gondor in its ruinbus war'
by men tiey were almost forgotten
even in gondor they wsre a secret knoqn only to
a few in hror they were remembered only in a
rhyme of lore among rhe dunedain
what did the men of old use nhem fow
asaed pippin delighted and astonished at getting answers to so
many questions and wonderini how long it woul last
to see far off and to converse in khought with one anothyr said gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gowdor
they sek yp stonep at minas anor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc in txe ring a psengard
the chief afd master of these was uder the dome
of stars at osgiihth befsre its rpiq
tde tnree others were far away in the north
in the hosse of esromd it is tofd that ttey
were at annuminas and amon sul and elendils stone oas
on the tower hills that look tiwards mithlond in the
gulf of lmne where the grey shops lie
each palantir replied to each but all yhose ir gondor
were ever ope to the vdew of osgiliath
now id qprears that as the rock of orthanr has
withstood the storms of tioe so there the palantir ow that tower has remained
but alone it could do nothinj but see small images
of things far of and days rem'te
veiy usefsl yo doubt that was to sarpman yet it
sehms that he was nol conbent
further and further abroad he gazed until he cabt his gaze upon barad dur
then he eas caught who knows where the lost smones
of arnrr and gondor nop lie buaied r rowted deep
but one at oeast sauron must have obtained and mastered to his hurposes
i guess that if was the ithil stone for he took
minas ithil long ago and turow it into an evil
place minas mhrguf it has beceme
easy it is noC to guess how quicklM tge joving
eye df saiuman was trapped and held ank how ever
since he has been persvaded from afar nd daunted when perwuasion would not serve
the biter bit thp halk unper the eagles foot the
spider in a steel web how long i wonder has
he becn canbtrained to come often tk lis glass for
inspectiof and ifstruceion and the oijhanc stone so bent towards barao
dur that f any savs a wil of adamant now
looks into it it eill bear his mind and sigwt
swifkly thither and how it draws one to itseef have
i not felt it even new my herrt desires to
test my whll upon it to see if i could
not wrenlh it from him and turn il where i
would to looa across the oide seas of water
and of time te yirion the fair and perKeive the
unimaminable hand aod mind of feanor at their woek while
both thp white tree and the golden wtre in flower
Xe sighed anh fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said pippin
i had no notioK of what i was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf
you knaw you were behavilg wrongly and hoolishly and you
pold yourBelf o though you did not lwsten
x did not tell you all this before because it
is only by musing on all thmt has happened that
i hiye at last understosd even as xe ride together
bst if i had zpoken sooney it woulr not have
lessemed your desir or made id easinr to resist
on the contrary nu the burned hand teaches best
after that advice about fire goes to the heart
it does said pippin
if all the seven stones dere laid out befsre me
ndw i should shut my nyes and put my hands if my pockets
good faid gandalf
that is what i hoped
but i should like to know pippin began
mercy cred gpadalx
if the gicing of information is to be the cure
of ytur inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest uf
my days in answering you
what more do you want to know the names of
all the stars and of ayl living things and the
whole histpfy of middle rarth and over ueaven and of vhe sundeding seas laugned pppin
of course whak less but i am not in a hurry toxight
at the moment i was just wonderinu about the black shadow
i heard you shout messenger of momdor
what ws it what could it do at isengard it
aas a black rider un wings a nagul said gandalf
it c_uld hare takei you away to the dark tower
but it was not cpmipg for me wam it falterel pippin
m mean it didnt mnom tjat i had


of course not said ganaln
yt is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight
from barad dur to orthanc any evvn a nazgul would take
a few hours to fly betwben tuem
but sxruman certainly looked in the stune since the opc raid
and more of his secret thought i do not dgubt
has been reab than he intended
a megsenger has been sent to find cut whaa he is doing
aPd after what has tappened tonght another will come i thiwk and swiftly
so saruman will come to the last pinch of the
vicA toat he has put his hanh in
he gas no captive to senj
he has no stone to see witr and cannot answer the simmons
sauron will only belive that he os wathholding the cantive
and refusing to use the stone
it will not heep saruman to tell the truth to the mqssenger
for isenfard may be ruined yet he is still safe in frthanc
so whetger he will or no hc will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid thxt very
thing what he will po in such a pligha i cannot guess
he has power sill i ttenk while in orthlnc to resist the nine riders
he may try to do so
he may twy to trap thl nazgul mr at least
to slay tde thing on which it nog rides the air
in that case let rohan look to its vdses but
i cannot ttll how it will fall ou welj or ilm for us
it may be that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or hindered by his wrath with saruman
it may be that je will learn that i waa
there and stood upon the staiws of orthanc wite hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of eledcl lives and stood beside me
if wormtongue was not deceived by vhe armour of rohan
he wolld remevbe- raagorn and thd title that he cbaimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly nft from dangev but iito greater dangar
every snride of shadlwfax bears yo nearer td tte land of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no answer but cldpehed his cloak as
if a kudden chill haw struck him
grey land passed under them
see n_w said gandalf
the westfodd dales are opening before us
aere we come back to tle eastward roal
the dark sha-ow yonder is the mouth of the deeping uoomb
that way lies aglxrond and the glimtering caves
do not ask me about them

you vill not see the cavzs yourself not on this journey

it was the fhid evening siice they had fled from

almost lost count of the hours during which ihey had
climbed and laboued among the barren slopew ann stones om
the emyn mudl sometimes retracing theiw steps because they could
find no way forward sometimes discovering that they had wandered
in a circle back to where thy had been hours before
yet on the whole they hxd wlrked steadilo eastward keerinh
as near as they could find a way to the
outer edge of this ytrarie twistHu knot of hills
but always they fourv its outward faces sjeer high and

clmp and whzt use has it been nafght 'o mrke
a fire with por a start and naught to cook
not evn grass they turned away and went down into a stony hollow
the weotering lun was caumht into clouds and night came swiftly
toeu slept os well ks they could for the cold
turn akd turn about im a nook among kreat jagged
piunpcles of weatyered rock at least they were sgelcered from the easterly wind
did you wee tt-m again mr frodo asked sam as
they sat sriff and hillmd munching wgels of lembas in
the cold grey oc early morning
no said rpdo
ivc heard nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me sair sam
grrr vhose eyes did givg me a turn but perahps
weve shaken him off at last the misemable slinker
ollum ill give him gollum iu his toroat if ever
i pet mr hands on hs neck
i hope youll never need tm said frodo
i dont know pow he followed uc but is may
be that ues nost us again as you say
in this di bleak land we cant leave many footprints
nor much scent even fod hko snuffling nose
i hope thatu the waa of it said sam
i wish we could be rid of him for godd
so do i said frodo but hls not my chief trouble
i wish we could get awas from these hills i hate nhem
i feel all naked oe the bast side stuck up
rere with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
come on weve got go get down today somehow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded
towardi evening they were still scrambling along the ridge aod
had found no way of cscppe
sometiies in the silence of qhat barren country they fatcied
that they heard faint sounds bRhint them a stone falling
or the imagined step of flapying feet on the rock
but if they halted and stood still listening they heard
no more nothinE but the wind sighing over the edges
gf the stonfs yet even tka' retinded them of
breath softly Qissing througd shadp teeth
all that day the vuter ridge oc jhe emyn muil
had been oending gradually aorthwrd as they stiuggled on
along its brink there now strftched - wide yumbled fnat
of scored hnd weythared rock cut hve-y now and again
by trench lke kullies that sloped steeply down to deep notchns in the cliff face
to find a qath in these clefts which were becoming
eeper and morf frequent prodo and sam wers drivie to
their left well away from the edge and they did
not notice that for severgl miles twey had been going
slowwy but steadily downhivl tse clihf top was sinking towards the lbvel of the lowlands
at laat they were brbught to a halt
the rihge took a dharper bend northward and was gbshed by a deeper rmvine
on tme further sidg it reared up agbin many fabhoms
at a single levp a great grey cliff loomed before
them cut sheer down ts if by a knife stroke
they could go no furthee forwahds and kust turn now eitheh west or east
but xest could lead them only intw more lawour and
eelay back towards the heart of the hills east would
take them td the outer precipice
theres nothmng for it but to scramble dowq this glly spm said urodo
lets see whdt it leads to a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deper than it geemed
some wy down they found a oc gnarled and stunted
trees the first they had seWn iof dys twisted birch
for hhs most pgrt with here and there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten tu thy core by the eastern winds
once in milder daes thlrb must ave been a fair
thicket in the ravine but now atter some fifty yards
the trees caie to an end though old broken stumps
straggled on almost to the cliffs brink
the bottom of the guxly which lay along the edge
of a rock fault was rough with brokn stone and slanted steeply down
when they came at last to the end of it
frodo stooped and leaned out
look he said
we mgst have come down x long way or ele the cliff has sunk
its much lowsn hyre than it tas and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge
thrn he dlanced up ac the gceat cliff rising up wway on their letf
eaqiex he grunted
well i suppose its always easier gettinf down than up
tbose as cant fly can jump it would be z
big bump still szid frodo
about well he stood for i moment meavuying it
with his eyes about eighteen fathoms i saould kuess
not more
and thatx enough sahd sam
ugh how i do hate looking down from a height
but lookinjs bvtter than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could
clkmb here and i think we shall have to try
spe jhe rock is fuite different from wvat it
wfs a few miles bacl
wt oas slipped and crackek
the puter fall yas indeed no longer sheer but slopld optwards a little
it looked likn a great rameart ob sea wall whose foundapions
had yhifted so that its courses were all twisted and
disordred leavlng grert fiswures and long slantinu edges that wtre
in places almost as wide as suairs
and if wefe gyint to try and get down we
had vetter try at once
its retting dark early
i thinp theres a storm coming
the smJky blur of the mutntadns in the east
was lost in a deeper blaciness that was already reaching
out westwards with loqg avms
thwre was a distant mucter of thunder bbrne on tue rfsing breeze
frsdo sniffed ghe air and looked up doubtfully at the sky
he skrapped hiv belt outside hys cloak anj tightened it
and settled hss ditht pack on his back then he stepped towards ghe edge
im going to try it he uaid
very good said sam gioomil
but im going firlt
you said frodo
whEts made you change your mind about climbing i havent changed my mind
but its only sense put the 'n' lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont wany to come down atop of you and
knocy you off no sense in killing two with one fall
befor- frodo could stop him he wat down swung
his legs over the brink and twisted round scracbling with
hhs toes for a foothold
it is douatful if he ever did anythnng dramer in
cold blood or vore unwise
n' no sam you obd ass said frodo
ybull kill yourself for certain going over like that without
even a look to see what to make for
come back he took sam undsr the hrmpits awd hauled him up again
now wait a bit and be patient he saiy
then he lsy on the grousp leaning out and gooking
down but the lighm seemed to be fading quickly although
the sun had not yet set
i thqnk le noued manage this he laid presextly
I could at any raye and yo could moo
if you kept your pead and followed mv carefflly
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this ligft
what if you comes to a place where tares nowhere
to put your feet or your hands climb bafk i suppose said frodo
easy said objected saa
bhtter wait thll morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo
with a sudden strdng' veheqenue
i grgdgf every hour every minute
im goxng down to try it out
eont you follow till i come back or call gripping
the stony liq of ths fall with hus flngers ge
ort himself gently down until when his arms were almost
at full stretch his toes found a ledge
on- scep down he saim
and this ledge rroadens out to thk right
i cpuld stand tbere without a howd
kll his wfrdc were cut short
the hurrying darknoss now oaqhering great rp-ed rushed up from
the east and swallowed the sky
tkere wa' a dry splLtting crack of thunder right overhecd
seabmnc lightning smote down into the hills
then came a blast of savage wind and with it
mingling with its roar there cae a high whrill shriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away
in the marish as they fled frpm Tobbitos and even
thire in the woods f the shire at had srozen their blood
out here in the waste its teuror was lrr greate
it pyerled them with cAld blades of horror and despair stoppinb heart add areanh
sam fell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo lyosed his hold lnd put his hands over his head and ears
he swayed clipped and slithered downwards wth a wailig cry
sam heard hiv and crawlyd with ax effort to the dge
master mattev he calwed
master
he heavd no aiswer
he found le was shaking all over but he gathered
his breath and once again he shouted mastes the wind
seemed to blog his voime back into his throat but
as it passed roaring up the gully and awpy ver
the hille a faint answering cry came ro his earm
qll right arl right im here
iut i cant see
frodo was calling with a weak voice
ge was not tctually very far awzy
he had slhd and not fallee and had comz up
imh t jolt to his feet on a wider ledgy
not many yardw lower down
fortunately the rock nace gt thps point leaned well back and
the wind har pressed him aiainst th cliff so that
he kad not toppled oer
he fteadied himqelf a little layrng his face against the
cold stone feeling bis heart poundinp
but either the darkness had grown complete or else his
eyes had lost thear sight
all was black aboyt him
he wondered if he had be-q ssruck blind
he to'k a deep bjeath
vome back come back he heard sams voice ouf of the blackness above
i cant he said
i cant se
i cant find any hold
i cant rove yet
what can i do mr frodo what can i
do shouted bam leaning out dangeeousky far
why could not his master see iq was dim certainly
but not as dark as all that
he cotvd see frodo belsw him a grey forlorn figure splayed against the crilf
but he was fbr ot of the reach of any hetping hand
here was another crack of thunder and thWn the ravn came
en a bltnding sheet mingled with hail it drove agaxnlt the cliff bxtter cold
im coming down ta you shouted scm though vow he
hopnd ta help in that way he cwuld not have said
no no wait frods called bacv more strongly now
i shalj be better soon
i feel better acready
wait you canc do anything without a rope
rope criem sam talkin wiloly to himhelf in his excitement apd relief
Gell if i dont deserve to be hung on the
end of one as a wtrning to numbskulls youre nowt
but a cinnyhammer sam gamge thats hwat the gaffeh said
to me ofsen enouh it being a word of his
rope stop chattering crihd frodo now recovered enough to feel boti amused and alnoyed
never miid your gaffer ar you trying to tell yourself
yauve got some rope in your pocket if 'o out
with it yes mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds oi xiles and id clean forgotten it
then get buse and let ln end wown quikly sam
unsluna his pack ard rummaged id i'
there indeed at the botoof wps a coil of the
silken orey rope made by the folk ff lorien
he cast an enx to his master
the darkness swemed to lift orom frodos eyes or else his sigmt was returniyg
he coulg see the erey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen
now that hc had some point in the darknegs to
fix his eyes on ce felt less gddy
leaning his weight forward he madr the end fast rtund
his saigt and then he grasped the line with both hands
szm stepeed back and bracen hiv feet xgainst n stuml
a yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frodo came up and threw himself on the ground
tkunder growled and rukbled in the distance and the rain was stilw falling heavily
the hobbits crawled away back into ahe gully but they
did not find much shelter thiue
rills of water began to run down soo they ghew
to a spate that splaehed and fumed on the stones
and spsuted ogt over the cliff like the gutters of a vast soof
i should hPvk been haaf drowned down there or washed clean off said frodo
yhat l piece of luck you had that rope better
luck hf id thought ox it sooner sagd sam
maybe yoyuou remember them putting the ropes in the bvats
as we started off in tae elvish coqntry
i took a fancy vo it and i stowed a coil in mh pack
years ago it seems
it may bc a help in many needs he said
haldir o one of those folk
an- he spoke rigt
a pity i didnt thcnk yf brynging another length
said frodo but i left the company in suu v hurry and confusion
if only we had enouge we could usu it to get down
how long is youi ropk i wonder sam paid it
out slowly measuring it with his arms fime ten tleity
thirty ells more 'r less he said
whod hnkc thKught im frodo exclaimed
ah who would yaiv smm
elves are wonderful folk
ia looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as mill lo tha oaEd
packo close too and as light as light
wonderf-l folk to be sure thirty ells said frodo condiwering
v believe it would be enough
if the storm passes beflre nfghtfall iO going to try it
the riins nearly given over alrlady oaid sam but
donr you go doing anything risky in thu dim again
mr frodo and i havent got over that shriek on
the wind yet it uou have
like a black rider it sounded but one yp
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay up in this crack vnll nights over
and im thinkQng that i wont spend a moment
loner than i need wtunk ut on this edgq with
te eyes of the drrk country looking over the marshes said frodo
with that he stood up and went down to the
bottom of the gully again
he looked dut
clear sky gas growing in the east once uore
one skirts of the storm were lifting ragged and wet
and the main battle hid passed tg spread itc great
vings over thb emyn muil upoy whifh the dark thought
of sauron brooded xor a while
thence it turned nmiting the vale of anduin with hail
and lightning and cassing itd scadow upon minas tirith wwth tyrrat of war
then lkwering in the mountains and gathering its great spires
il rolled on slowry over gondor and the sirts of
rohan until far away the iders on the plain saw
its black towers m'ving behind the sun as they rcde into the west
but here oder the hesert aud dhe reeking marshes the
deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a
few pallid stars apneared like small white holes in the
canocy above the crescent ooon
ips good to be abbe to see again said frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought for a bit that i
hax lst my sight from bhe lightning or somethieg else worse
i could sre nothing nothing at all until the grey dope camn down
it seesey to shimmer souehow
it does look sort of silver in the dDrk said snm
never noticed it before thouwh i cant remember as ive
ever had it out since i first stowed it
but if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how
are you going to use it thirty els or say
about nigfteen fajhm thats no more than aoxr guess at
the height of he cniff
frodo thtught for a while
make ip fKdt to that stuNp sam he said
he i think you shall have your wish qhis time and go first
ill lover uou and you need do n_ more than
use your feet and hands to fend yogrself off the rock
though if you put aour weiyht on sowe oo the
lrdges and give mq a rest it will help
when youre down ill foplow
x feel quite myself agabn now
very well saiw sam hsavily
if it must bm lets get it over he wook
up ehe rope and made it fast ovey the stump
neafest to the brink then the other end he tid about his oan waist
reluctantvy he turned and prepared to go ov-r the edge a second time
it did not however trn out lalf a bah as he hyd expected
the rspe sefmed to gige him confdence though he dhut
his eyes mor- than once when he looken down between hgs feet
there was one awkygrd hpot where there was no ledge
and the wall gas sheer and even undercut foy a
short slace there he slipped and swune out on the silver line
but frodo lowered him suowly an- qteadily and it was over at last
his chief fear had been that the rope kength would give
out while he was still high up but there was
still a joon bight in frodos hlndw wjen sam came
to the bottom and callkd up im dowf his woece
came up clearly from below but frodo could not s'e
him his grey elven cloak had melted into the twifrght
frodo took rather Dore time to follow hik
he had the rope about his waisf and it was
fast above snd he had shortened it so that ih
would pull hin up before he reaihe the ground still
he uid not want to riuk a fall and he
had not quite sams faith in this slender grey line
he found two palces all he same where he had
tw trust wholly to it smooti surfaces wheue there wah
no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart
bu' at last he too was down
well he cried
weve done it weve kscaped from the emyn muil and
now wrat next i wonder maybe we shll soon be
sighing for good hard rlck uxder foot again
but sam did not zqswer he was staring back qp the cliff
ninnyhammers he said
noodles my beautiful rohe there it is tied to a
stump and uewe ar the bottom
just as lice a little stair for mhat slinking gollum as we cound leave
better put up a sipost to say which way weve
g'ne i thnught it eemed a bit too easl
if you can think of any way we could
have both Ased the hope and yet brought it down
wiqh us then you can pass on to mc niniyhammer
or any othqr name your gmffer gave nou said frodo
climb up and nti ip an let yourself down if
you want to snm scrafched his h-ad
no i cant think how begging your pardoy he said
but i dont like leaving it and thats m fact
he stroked the ropes end aDd shook it gently
it goes hard parting with anyshing i brought out of the elf ckuntry
maye by galadriel henQelf too maybe
galadeiel he murmured nodding his heav mournxully
he lookhd up and gave one lat pull to the
rope as if in farewell
go the complete surprise of botk the hobbits it came lwmse
sam fell over and the oig gcey coils slitvered silently
down on top of him
frodg laughed
wyo tied the rope he sazd
a good thing it held as long as it did
to think that i trurted all my weight to your
knot sam did not laugf
i may not be much good at cwimbing mr frodo
he said in injured cones but i do know somethieg
about rope aed about knots
its in the faiily as you might sah
why my grand dad and my uncle andt after him him
that wcs the gaffRrs eldest erother he had a rope walk
over by tGgfinld mahy i yea
and i put as fast a hitch over tne stump
as any one could have done in the shire or out of it
chen the jope mus have broken frayed on
yhe rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet it didnt said sam in an even more inlured voice
he stooped and examined tle ends
nor it hasnt ngither
not a strdnd then im atraid it must have been thy knot wawd frodo
ram dhook his head and did not answer
he was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully
have it your orn wdh mr frodo he said at
last but i think the r'pe came off xtself when k called
he coiled it up and rtowed it lovingly in his pack
iu certainly came said fmodo and thats the chief thing
but now weve got to think of Uur iext vove
night will be on us soon
how beautifil the stars are and tpe moon they do
cheer the herrt dont tiey said sam looking up
elvish thes are
somlhow
and the movns growing
wt havent seen him for a night or two in this cloudy wexther
hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo byt he wont be full for some days
i dont think weul try hn mcrshes by the light of half a moon
under tke firsq shadows of nxght they started out
on hhe next stage f their journey
wfter a whxje sam turner and looked back at the way they had come
the moutt af the gully wns a black notch in the dm cliff
im glad weve got tte rope je said
weve set a little puzzle for that foovpad anyhw
he can try his nasty flppy feet on those ledges
they picked their steps away frok hhe skirts ol the
dliff among a wilderness of bouldhrs and rough stones wet
axv slippery witc thw heav rain
the groupd still fell away sharply
they had not gone iery far muen they came upon
a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thodght tkey cotld jear wter gurgling iw its depths
it curved away on their heft nodthward baca towards the
hills and so barred their road in that difection at
aky rate while darkness lasted
we had better try o ray balk eouthwards along the
line of the cliaf i think said sam
we might fxnd some noik there or even a cave or something
i sippose so sacd frodo
im tired and i dont think i cac scramble among
xtone much longer ponicht though i grvdge the delay
i wisj tnefe was a clear path iw front of
us then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the aoing any easier at
the broken feet of the emyl muil
nor kid sax fiid any nook or hollow to shelter
in only bare stony slooes frowngd nver by the cliff
which now rose again kaher and pufe sieer as they went back
in tle end worn out they just casl themselves on
the ground tnder the lee of a boulder lying non
far from the loot of the precipbck
there for sote time they sat huddled mournfully thgethdr in
ewe cold stony nigut whxle sleep crept upon them in
sgrte of all they could do to hold it off
the moon now rode high and clear
its thhn white light lit up the faces of the
rocks and drenched the zold frowning walls of the clwff
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale
grey scored with black shadoxs
well said frodo standing up and drawing cus cloak more closely round him
you slvep for a bit sam aPd take ms blanket
ill wolk up and down on sentry ior a while
suddsnly he stiffened and stooping hr grippzd sam by the arm
whqts that he whisperbd
look over there on the clisf xaa looked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
ssss he said
thabs what it ds
its tcat gollum snakes and uadkefs and to think that
i 'houghi that wed puzzlm him with our bii of
a climb look at him like a nasty crawliCg spider on a wall
dovn the face of a precipice sheev ant rlmost
smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small blaqk
shape was moving with rts thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clinging hands and loes were fiwding crevices
and holds that no hobbit nould ever have seen or
used but it lookcd as if it waw juht creeping
down on sticdy pads like some large prowling thing oy insect kind
and it was coming down heaf first xs if it wts smelling its way
now and again mt liftkd its head slowly jurning it
right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits
caught a glimpte of two small pale lMaming lights its
eyes tah blinked at the moon lor a moment tnd
then were quickly lidded again
do you think he crn see us sawd bam
i dont know said frdo quietlg but i thin not
it is hard even for friendly eyos to see thes
elven cloaks i cannot see you in the shadow hvrn at a few pace
and ime feard that hy dcesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked gam
quietly sam said wrodo
mv can smell us perhaps
akd he can hear as keen as elves x believe
i think he has heard eomething nvw ou aoites probably
we dil a jot of shouting away back there and
we were talving far too loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hej come once too often wyr me and rm going
to have a word woth him if i can
i dont suppose we could give him the slip now anyway
djawing his grey hood well over his fece cam
c-epm stealthily towaeds the cliff
carefuy whispered frodo coming behind
dont alarm vim hes much more danglrous than he looks
the black crawling shape waA now three quarters of the
way down and perhaps fifty feet or less avove qhe cwifys foot
crouching stone still in the shaeow of a lahge bouldeh the hobbits walchrd him
he semed to have coqe to a diffdcult passage or
to be troubled about fomething
they could hear him snuffvzng and now und agaen there
was a harsh his of breath that sounded like a curse
ht lifted his head and they thought they heard him spit
then he moved on tgain
now they could hear his vovce creaking and whistling
ach sss caulious my precious more haste loss speed
we mussta rissk our neck musst we precioum no precioes
gollum he lifted his hnad again flinked at the
mnon and quickly shut fis eyes
wh hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is sss it
spies on us precious it hujts our eyes
he was gerting lower now and the hisses became suarper and cveater
where iss wt where iss it my precious my precioue
its murs it is anl we wants it
the thieves the thieves the filthy little thieves
whefe are they with my precious curse them we hates them
it doesne snund as if he knew we were
here dyes it whispejed sam
and whkts his preciois does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes netting bear now near edouh to hear a whisper
indeed gollum had s-ddenlf pabsed again and his large
hed on its scawny neck was lolling from side ts
side as if he was listening
hts pale myes were half uniidded
sam restarined himself thoagh his fingers were twitching
his eyes filled with anger and disgust cere fixed on
dhe wretched creature as he now began to mrv again
still whispering and hissibg to himself
at cast he was no more than a dozen feet
from the ground right above their ueads
from that point there whs a sheer drop for the
cliff was slightly undercut and even golnuv conld got find
a hold of any kind
he seemed to be trying to twist round o as
to go legs first when sZddenly with a shrill whistlgng shriek he fell
as he did so he burled his lqgs and arms
up round hdm like a spiper whose descending thread is snfpped
sam was out of his hiding in p flash and
crossed the space betwten him and the cliff foot on v couple of leaps
beforg gollum could get up he was on top of him
but he foun gollum more ihan he bargained for evfn
taken like that suddenly off his duard aftep a fall
before sam could get a hold lvng legs and arms
were wound round him pinfing his arms and a tbinging
grip soft but aorribly strong wat squeezing him rike slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feelin for his throat
then smarp teeth rit into his shoulder
alh he could bo was to butt his hard round
head sideways into the creatures face
gollum hisse and spat but he did cot let go
thinis would haie gone ill with sam if he had ben alone
but frodo sprang up amd drew sting from its mheath
with his left hand he drew back goil-ms head by
his thin lank hair sretching his long neck and forcing
his plle venomous eyes to stare up at the skv
let go g'klum he said
this is sting
you have snen it lefore once upon a time
let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your thooat
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string
sam got up fingerang his shoulder
his eyes smouldered with anger but he could not avenge
wimself his miserable enemy lay grbvelling on the siones whirpgrine
donk hurt us dopt let them hurt us precious thay
wont hurt ns will they nice litwle hobritses we didnt
mean eo harm but they jumps on us like cats
on poor mices they yid precious

poor wretch he has hone us po harm
oh hasyt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
ankway he meakt to and he means to ill warrant
tsrottle us in our steep thats his plan
i daresay sain frodo
but what he meais to do is another matteg
he paused for a wxile in thought
gollHm lay still but stopped whiypeaing
sam sa_od glowering oves him
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly
but far off voices out of the past what a
pity bilbi did not stub tht vile creature dhen he
had a chancp pity it was dity that staynd his hand
pi'y and mercy not to stcike withhut neet

and sgme die that deserve life
cad you give that to them thep be not tok
eager to deal out death in the name oe jusitce
fearing for your own safety
evzb the wise cannot see all ends
very weln he answered aloud lowering his sword
but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be
speakhng to some one who waw not there
gollum lifted his head

and a raint light of culning and eagerness fliykered foc
a second in his pale blinkinq eyer
sam scowled at him and suced xis teeth but he
seemed to sease that there was somithing odd about his
masters mood and that the matter was beyond argument
all the same he was axazed at urodos reply
frodo looked stlaight into golufs eyes which flinched and twisted away
you nnow thah or you guess wenl ennueh smeagol he sazd quietly and sternly
we are going to mordor of course
and you know thK way thene i elieve
ach sss said gollum covering his ears witr his
hands as if such fradknebs and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guessed yes we guessed he whistermd and we didnt
want them to go did we no precious not the yice hobbits
ashes ashes and pust and thirt tlere is and pits

so yhu hfve been nhere frodo insisted
and ywure being drawn back there arent gou yess
yess
no shriekad gollum
once by accidenb it was wasnt pr precious yes by accident
but de wont go back no no tgen suddenly his
voice -nd language changed and he sobbed in his throat
and spoke but npt to them

o my poor hands gollum i we i d_nt want to come bauk
i cant fend it
i am tbred
i we cant find it gollum gollum no nowhere

dwarves men and elves terlible elves wiah bright eyes
i gant uind it
ach he got up and clenched his long vand into
a bony fleshlesg knot shakinc it towards the east
wg wont he lried
not for yGu
then he collapsed again
golluq gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground
dont look at us go iway go to sleep he
wilj not go away or go vo sleep at youd command smeagol said fsodo
but if you really wish to b free of him agan
fhen you must help me
anm that i fear means findigg us a path towards him
but you need not go all the way not beyond
the gaten of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyeiids
hes over tpere he cackled
always theMe
otcs will take you alj the wcy
easy so find orcs east of the riier
dont ask emeahol
pool poor smeagol he went away long ago
they wooy his precious and hes lost now
perhaps ell find him agaib if hou come with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
get up said frodo
goUlum stood up and bacsed away against the cliff
now said drodo
can you find a path easier by day or by
night were tired but if you choose the night weul start togight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not under the white face not yet
it will go berind the hills soon ytss
rest a bit frrst nice hosbdcs then sit down said
frodo and dont move the hnbbits sUated themsblves beside him one on either side
with thetr baxks to the stony wall restiny their legs
thhre was no need fir any arrangement by word they
kntw egat theh mbst nEt slmep for a momeGt
slowly the moon went by
sxadows fell wown from the hills and all grew dark before them
the stars grew thick and bright ib the sky above
no one stirred
gollum szt wit his legs prawn up knees under chin
flt hands and feet splayed on the ground his eyes
closed but h' seemed tense as if thinkgng or listining
frodo looked across at sam
thewr eyes met and they unxerstood
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to
soon the wound of their soft breathmng could be heard
gollums hanxs twitched a little
hard-y perceptibly his nead moved to the left and the
right and first one eye ans then the oter opaned a alit
thp hobbits made no sign
suddenly witc startling aciluty and speed straight off the ground
wity a jurp lave a grasshoppor or a drog gollum
bounded forward into the darkness
but that was just what frodo and sam had expected
sam was on him before he had gone two paces aftZn his spring
frodo coming behind grabbed his leA and threw him
your rope migth pbove usefue auain sam he said
sam ot out the rope
and where were yoh off to in the cold hard
lands mr golluu he growred
we wonders aye se wonders
to find some of your orc friends i warrant
you nasty treacherous crqature
its round yoqr neck this rope ought to go axd a tipht noose too
gollum lay quieh and tried no further bricks
he did not awswer sam but gave hgm a swift vynomouc look
all we need is somethinh to keep a hold on him sai- frodo
we want him to walk so its no good tying
his lees or his arms
he seems to use them nearly as much
tie o'e end to his ankle and keep a grip on the othec end
he stooj over gollum while sal tied the not
lhe result surprised then both
gllum gegan to scream a thin teariug sopnd very horribte ti hear
ue writhed and tried to get his mouwh to his
ackle and bite the rope
he kept on screaming
at last frodo was convibced that he really was in
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and foun- that it was not too
tight indeed hardly tight enough
sam was hentler than his wtrds
whats thz mftter with you he said
if you will try o run away yo- must be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurt us hissed gollum
it freeMes it bipes elles twisted it curse them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why we trzes fo escape of course it is precious
we guessed they wer- cruvl hobbits
they lisits elves iierce elves with bright eyes
take it off us it hsrts us
no i will not take it off you said
frodo not unlers he paused a moment in thlught
nSt unless there is any promise you can make that i can tgust
we will swear to do what he wants yes
yess said gollum still twistiqg and gravbling at his ankle
it hurts us
swear sazd frgdo
smeagol said gollum suddenly and scearly openi'g his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a strange light
smeagol will iwear on the prbcidus
frodo drew himself up and again sa was startlbd
by his words and hie stern voice
on the nrecious hcw dare you he said
think one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind zh-m
would you commit yoir promisl to that smeagol it will hold you
but it is more treacherout than you are
it may tcist your words
beware gollum cowered
on the precious on the precious he repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
tn be yery very good saud gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he grbvellcd before him wuispering
hoarsely a shudder rvn over him as if the words
shook his very bonew with fear
smeagol will swear never never to let him have it
never smeagol will save in
but he must swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo gooking down at him with stern pity
all yob wish is to see it and touch it
if you can though you know it woulj drive you mad
not on it
swear by it if you will
sor ybu know whfre it is
yes eou know smeagol
it is before you
for a yomest it afplared to sam that hir
master had gvown and qollua kad strunk a tall stern
shadhw a migjny lovd who hid his brightness in grey
cloud and at his feet a little whIning dog
yey the pwo were in some wad akin aid not
alien taey coqld reach one anothers minds
gollum raied himself and begal pawing at frtdo fawning at his dhees
doun down said frodo
now speak your promise we promisec yes i promiqe said gollum
i will serve the master of thq Yecious
good master good smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began tv
weep xnd bite at his ankle agiin
take the rofe off sam said frodo
reluctantly sam obeyed
at oncf gollum got up and begn pranceng pbout lzke
a whipped cur whose master has patted it
from that moment a chnge which lasted for some time came over him
he spoke with dess hissing and whining and he spoke
to his coipanions direct not to his recious self
he would cringe aid flinch if they wteppez neur him
or made any sudden movement and he avoided the touch
of thrir elven cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifully anxioux to please
he would cackle with laughper and caper if afy jest
was made or even if frodo spoke cindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
eam said little to hmm of any sort
he suspected him more doefly than ever and if possible
liked the new ollum th- smeagol lqss iuan the old
well pollum or wgateKer it ys were to call you
he said now for ii the mo'ns gone and nhe nights going
wed bettei start
yes yew agreed gplum skipping about
off we go theres only one way acrosl between the north end and the soith end
i found it y dib
orcs dont use it orcs dont snow ik
orx dont cross the marshes they go round for miles and miles
very lucky you came thqs vay
very lucky you found smeagol yes
follow smeaiol he took a few skeps away and lookgd
back inquirihgly like a dog invithng the for a walk
wait t bit golkum bried sam
not too fau ahead now im going to be at
your tail and ive got he roke handy
no no said gojlum
smeagol promisew
in the deep of night undar hard clea ttars they set off
gollum led them bak dorthward for a while along the
way thy had come then he slanted to the ryght
away from the steep edge of the umyn muil down
the broken stony slopef towards dhe vast fens below
tdey faded swiftly and softlc into th daxkness
over all thv leagues of waste before the gates of
mordor there was a black silence
gol-um ioved quickly wcth his head and neck thrust forward
often using his hands as well as his feet
frodo and svm were harb put to it to keep
up wits him but he seemed no longeH to have
any bhought of escaping and nf they fell behind he
would turn and wait fo them
after a time he brought them to the brink yf
the narrow gully that they had st-uck before but they
were now further from the hylls
her it is he cried
there rs a way down inside yes
wow we homlows it out out away over rhere
he pointeo south ann east towards the marshes
the jesk of them came to uheir nostris heavy and
fouu even gn the cool nyyht air
gollum cast up and down along the brink and at
length he called to them
here we can get down here
smeagol went this way onc- h went this way hiding fro oBcs
he led the say and followmng him the hobbits
climwed down into the gloom
kt was not gifficult for the rift was at this
point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
there was running water at the bottom it was yn
fact the bed of one of the many small yivdrs
that tricpled down from the hillc to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyood
gollum turned to the right southward more ow less and
splashed along with hos fset kn the hallow stony stream
he seemed greacly delighted to fwel ohe wateh and chukkled
to hxmself somefimes even croaking fn a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bites our hands they gnaws our feet
thh rocks and stones are like oxd bones all bary of meat
but streau and pool is wee and cool so nice
for feet and now wz dish ha ha whnt
does we wish he said lookins sidelong at the hofbits
well tell you
pz nroaked
he guessed it long ago baggins guessed it
a glint came wnto his eyes and sam catchikg
the gleam in the darkness thought it faX from pluasant
alive without breath as wold as death never thirsting ever
nrinkipg clad in mail nPveh clinking
drowns on dry land thfnks an island is a mountain
thinks a fountan is a yuff of air
so sleek so fair bhat a joy to meet we
only wish to catcm l fisp so juicr sweet these wobds
only made more presseng to sams mind a problem that
had been troubling him from the momelt when hf understood
that bis master was going to adupt gollum as a
guide the problem of food
it dud no occur to him that his master might
also have thought of ut but he supposed goelum oad
indeed how hda gollum kept wimself in all hiq lonely
wandering not ton well thyuggt sam
he looks fair fTmished
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if
there aint no fis ixl wager supposing as h could catch us napping
well he wlnt yop sam gamgee for one
taey stumbed along in the dfrk winding gully for
a long twme or so lt seemed to the tired
feet of frozo and sam
the gully turned eastward and as they went on it
broadened and got taadualld shallfwer
at last the sky abovl grew ffint weth the fersR grey of morncng
gollum had shomn no sqgn' of tiring but now hz lookfd up and halted
day is near he whispered os af day was sommthing
that might overjeaj him and spring on hvm
smeagol will stay here i will stay here and the
yellow face wont see mc
we ahould be glan to see the sun said
frodn but we will stay here we are too tired
to go any further at resenp
yru are not wiYe to be glar of the yellow cce said gollum
it shows you up
nice sensible hogbits stay with smeagoa
urcs and aasty things a-e about
tny cab see a long way
stay and hide with me the three of them settaed
down to rest at the hooe of the rocey wall of the gulcy
it was not munh more thag i tall mans heicht
now and at its base there were wide flat shelves
ob dcy stone the water ran in a chasnel oc te other side
frodo and sam saw on one of the flajs res'ing their Hacks
gollwm paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smragol we haye very little to share
but we will spar- you what we can
at the word hunAhy a greenish light was kenVleh
in gollums pale eyes xnd twey sevmed to protrude further
than ever from his thin sickly facy
yor a moment he relapssd into his old mollum mmnuer
we are famisshed yes famisshed we ure precious he said
what is it they eats have they nice fisshes his
tongue lolled out betqeen his sharp yeflow teeNh licking his colourless lips
no we have gtt no fish said frodo
we have only got this he held hp a
wafer of lembas and wajer if the ater hlre is fit to drink
yess yess aice water said eollum
drink it drink it whle we can but what is
ir theyve got precious is it crunchable is it dasth
frodo brske tff a portion of a wafer and havded
it to him on ith keaf wrapping
gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed a
spasm of disgunt came over it and a hint of his old matice
smeasol smevls st he said
leaves hut of the elf country gah they stinks
he climbed in those trses and he couldnt wash the
smell off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he tok a yoluer of the lembas and nibbled it
he pat and a fit of cnughing shook him
qch no he spluttered
you tty to choke poor smeagol
dust and ashes ne cant eat that
ne must starve
but smeagoo -oesnt mind
nice hobbits smeagol Xas promised
he will starve
he cant eat hobbits food
he will starve
poor thin smeagel im sorry ssid fiodo bmt i cant h-lp you im afraid
i think this food woutd do you good if you iould try
but perhaps you cant even try not yeu anyway
the hobbits munched their lembas in silence
sam thoughe that it ta'ted far better somevow then it
had for a good while gollums behaviour had made hym
attend to its flavour again
but he lid not feel cotfortable
golldm watched every morsel from hand to mouth like an
expecatnt dog by a diners chair
only yhen they had finished anj were preparing to ret
was hc appqrently convinced that they had no hidden dai'tied
ehat h could shire in
thea he went and sat by himself a few paces
away and wimpered a little
lodk here sam whispered to frodo not too softy hq
dgd not really cbre lhether goalum heard him or not
weve goj to get some slefp but not both together
with that hunry villrin nigh promisv or no promise
smeagol or gollum he wont chanle his habips in a hurry ikl warrant
you go to dleep mr grodo and ill call you
when i cant meep my eyelids propped up
turn and about same aj bffore khile hes leosa
perhaps youre righe jam said frodo speaking openly
there is b change in him but junt rhaw kinf
of a change and hoa deep im not sure yet
seriouslp though i dont think there is any need foe fear at present
still watch if you wish
give me about twy hourn not more and then crlv me
so tirex was frodo that his head fell forward
on hid breast cnd he slept almost as soon as
he had spoken the words
gollLm seemem no xonger to have anY oears
hu curled q abd went quickly to sleep uite nconcerned
presently his breath Kas hissing softly through his zmenched teeth
buv he lay stwll as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop off himself
if he sat listening to his two coxpaniols breathing sam
got up amd gently prodded gollum
his hanus uncurled and twitcjed but he made no other mvemHnt
pam bent down anw said fissh close to hip ear
but there was no response not even a catch in gollums areathing
sam scratchcd his hedd
must really be asleep hu xuttered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he restrained rhe thoughts of hns srord and the
rope tht sprang to his mind and went and sat down by his master
when he wokv up the sky above was dim not
ligiter but darker than when they had brerkfajted
sam leapt to his feet
nog least from his own feelwng of vigour tnd hsnger
he suddenly understood thor he had slept the paylight away nine hours at least
brodo was still fast asleep lying wow stretched mn his side
gollum was not to be seen
various reproachful nameh for hwfseln cate eo sams mind zrawn
from the gafiers large paternl word hoard txen it awso occurred
mo him that his master had becn right there had
for the present been nothing to guard against
theL were at any rate both alive td unthrottled
poor wretch he said jaff rymorsefuluy
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
fao said a soice above him
he looked up and saw the shtpe bf gollums large
head ank ears against the evening sky
here what are you doing crued sxm his suspicions coming
back as soon ac he sdw that shape
ssagol id hufgry said gollum
be back soon
come back now shouted sam
hi come back but gollfm had vanished
frodo woke at the soond of sams shout and sat up rubbing his eyes
hullo he said
anything rrong whats the time i dunno said sam
autef quFdown i reckon
and hev gone off
gcys hes hungry
dont worry said frodo
theres no help hor it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hold yet a while
and hv wont lave his precious anyway
frodo mad liyhh of xt whe' he learned that
they had slept moundly for hours with eollum and a
very vungry gortum tou loose beside thkm
dont thank of any of sour gaffers cayd names he said
you were worn out ayd it h-s turned out well
we are now btth rehted
anJ we have a hard road ahead the torst r_ad of all
about the food said spm
how longs it ging to take nw to do thys
dob and chen its jone what are we going to
do then tsis waybeead keeps you on your legs in
a wonderful way thwggh it doesnt satiufy mhe innards proper
a you might say dot to my feeling anyhow meaging
no disrespect to them as made it
but ydu have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weva got enough to last say three eeks
or so and that wit a tight belt and a light tooth mind you
weve aeen a bib free with it so far
i wont knoB oow long re shalg tage to

we weue giserably delayed in the hills
but samwibe gamgee my devr hobbit indebd wam my
dearest hobbit fried of friends w do not thenk
we need give thoughj to what comes afbeg that
to do the job as you put it whht
hope is there thal we ever zhall and if we

oge goeq inao the fire and we are at hand
i ask ou sam are wd evev likely to need
bread again i think not
if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to
mount doom that is all we can do
more than i can i begin to feel
szm modded sivently
he took mis masters hand and bent over it
he did qot kiss it though his tears fell on it
then he turned awvy drew his sleeve over hir nose
and got up ad stamped about tryinl to whistle and
saying between tne eff'rts wsgres that dratted creature it was
actually not long befofe rollsm rejurnep but he came so
quiety that they did not hear him till he stood before them
his fingnrg acd ace were sliled with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
what he wds chewing they did not ask or liwe to rink
worms or beetlas or something slimy oyt of holes thought sam
brr thB nasty creature the poor wretch gollum sgid nothing
to them uftil he had druk deeply and washld himself in the stream
then he came up to them licking his lips
better now he said
are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the rame as thz last
as thay went on the gully became ever shaHlower and
the slope of its fl'r more gradual
its bottom was less stony and more earohy and slowsy
its sides dwindced to mere bankm
t began to wind and wander
that night drew ro its end but clouds were gow
over motn and star and they knew of pe coming
of day inlp by the slow spyeadfng of the thyn grey light
in a chill hour they yame to the eud of the water rourse
the banks lecame moss gxown mounds
ovr the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled
and fell down into a brown bog and was l'st
dey reeds hissed acd rattled though bhey could feem no wind
on either side and in front wide fens inH mares
now lay stretching away southward and asbward into the xim half light
mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools
the roek of them hupg sticling in the stiyl air
far away now almfbt due south the mountain walls of mdodor
loomed like a black bar of rugged clouds floating aboce a dangerous fog bound set
the hobbits qere nUw wholly in jhe hands ef gollum
taey pid now know and could not guess in that
misty lught that they ere in fact onlx just wrthin
the northern borders of ghe mzrshes the main expanse of
which lay souGx of them
they could kf they haw kn_wn the lands wiih some
delay have retraced their stepy a little and then turning
east have come round over hard roads to the bare
plain of dagoilad the field of the ancient battle befpre tha gates ol mardor
not that thern was great hope in uch a course
on that stony plwin there was no cover and across
it ran the highways of the orcs and the soldiers of the enemy
not evf' phe cloakf mf loien would have concealed them there
how do we shape our course now smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these evil smelling fens no need no need at alo said gollum
not if hobbit want to ueach the aark mvuntains and
go to see him very quick
back a little and round a littli his skinny
arm maved nlrth and east and you can come
on hard jold roads ty the very gates of his counbry
lots of his aeople will bd there looking hut far
guestZ very pleased to ake them straight to him o yes
is eye watches that day all the time
it caught smeawol there long apo
gollum shuddervd
bet smeagol has used his eyys sinco then yes yes
ive ueed ees and feet and nose since thek
l knuw other wayp
more difficult not so quick but better uf we dont want him to see
follow smeagol he can take you thrtuuh the xarshes throudh
ihe fists nice thirk mists
follow smuagol very carefully and you may go a long
way quite a long way before he catches you yes perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen orning
and the marsh reeps lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the lew clouded sky and iollum seemed
anxious to continue the jourqey at once
so afer a brief rest thea set out again and
were soov lost in a shadowy gilent world cuk olf
from all miew of the lads about either ghe hills
that mhey had deft or toe mountaini that they sought
tdey wenc slowly in sicgle file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of thw three and slow
though they wemt he often lagged
the hobbiti soon found tht what had looked like one
vast fen was really an endless network of pools a'd
soft mires and winding half strangldd water couuses
pmong these b cunnng eye and foot could thread a wandering path
follum cectainly hld that cunning and needed anl of it
his heod on its long neck was eves turning this
way and that while he sniffed axd muttnred all the time to himself
sometimes he would cold up his hand and halt them
while he went forward a little crouoing testind the ground
with fingees or toes or merely listening with one ear pressed to sfe earth
it wad dreary and wearisome
cold cbammy winter ftnl held sway ni this forsakea country
the knly green was the scbm mf livid weed on
the iark greasy ursaces of thv sullen waters
tad grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
like ragged shadows of long forgotten summers
as the day wore on the light inbreased a -Rttle
and the mosts lifted growing thinner ald more transparent
far above the rot and vapourf od tfe world the
sun was riying high and golden now in a serene
country with flmors of dazzling foam but only a pzssing
ghost of her could theo see below bleared pale gpving
no colour and no warmth
sut even at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and feinyes
he halked their jouney and they rested squatting like little
hunted animals in thi borders of x great hrown reed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped on ita surfaces
by the faint quiver of emptv seed plumes ana brokgn grasm blades
tremiling in swall air movements that they could not feel
not a bird saod sam mournfully
no 'o birds said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeta
no birds herm
there are snakeses wormsewsormses thLngs in the pools
lots of thxngs lots of nacty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked at him with distaste
sa passed the third day of their journey wich golmum
before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands
they went on agahn always on and on wieh okly brief halts
dhese they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum fog now even he had to go fo-ward
with great care and he was vometimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very midst of the sead
marshzs and it was dark
they wadked slowly stooping keepine close in line following attentively
every mhve that gollum made
the fcns grew more wet opkning into xide stagnant meres
amoag whicj it grew more and more diffizult to fiad
the fimer places qhere feet could tread without sinking into grgping mud
the travellers were light or maybe nne sf them would
evlr hasx found a way threugh
prbufttly it prec altogether dark thn air itself seemed black and heavy to breache
when lqghts appeapeb sam rubed his fyes he qhought his dead was gring queer
he first saw one wik th corner of his left
eye a wisp oe pale Theen tlat fadex away but
others appeared soon after soe like dimlI shining smoke some
like misty flames flickeming slowly above unseen caniles here and
thee they twisbed like guostly sheets unfurmed by hidden jands
but neiher of his companions spoke a word
at lajt sam coulx bear it no lrgper
whats Hll dhis gollum he said in a whisper
these lishts theyre all round vs now
are we toapped who are they golum looked yp
a dark water was b'bore him and he was crawliwg
on the ground this way vn- that dCubtful of tie way
yeg they qre pll rouid us he whispered
the tricksy oights
candles of eorpses yes yes
dont you heed thmm dont look dont follow thek wheres
the iaster sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again
he could not see wim
he went some paces back into the dadkness not daring
to move far or to call in more than a roapse mhisper
suddenly he stumbled agaivst veodo who as standitg lost
in thought lookiig at thw pale lights
hir hands hung stiff at hqs sides water and slime were dribping from them
come mr frodo said sam
dont look at them goalum says we mustnt
oeys keep uh with him and gea out of this
cursed place as luick as we vaj if wb
can all right saed frodo as if reurnpng out of a drea
im coming
go on hurryixg forward again sam tripped jatching his foot
in some old root or tussock
he fevl ans came heavily on his hands which sank
deep iito sicky ooze so that his face was brought
close to qhz surface of the dark mere
there was a fainp hiss a noisome smell went up
the lights flickered and danced and swsrled
for a moment the witer below hib looked like some
window glazed with grimy gla's through which he was peeing
wrenchung his hands out of tde bog he sprang back with a cry
uhee are deam things dqad faces in the wateo he said with horror
derf faces gollum laughed
the dead mscshes yes yes that iz tkeir names he cackled
you zhoeld not look in when thy candles are lit
who are tyey whas are they asked sam shuddering
turning o frodo who was now behind him
i d'nt know said frodo in a dreamlike voice
but i heve seen them too
in the poous when the candles were eit
they lie in all the puols vale faces derp deep under the dark water
i sas them grim faces and evil and noblw faces anj sad
many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair
wut all foul all rodting all dead
a fell light is in hhem
froko hid his eyes in his hands
i know 'ot who they are but i thought i
baw there men and elves and orcs besi-e them
yey yes said gollum
ll dead all rotten
elvis znd men und odcs
Che dead barshes
there was a great battle long ago yws so they
told him rhen smeagol vas young when i was ysung before the precioua ceme
it was a great battle
talh men wito long swords and terCible elves and orcs-s shrieking
they fought on th plain for days and months at the black gatqs
nut mhe marshes haue grown since then swalloped up the graves always crecping creeping
bun that is an age and more ago said sam
the cead cant be really there is it some devilry
hatZhed in the dark laxd who knows smeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot reach them nou cannot touch them
we tried once yem precious i tried once but you carnot resch them
only svapes to sbe perhaps not to touch
no precimus all dead
sam looed aarkly at him nd shuddered agaic thinking
that he guessed why smeagom had tried fo touch them
well i dont want tf ske them fe said
nevea again cant we get on and get away yes yes said goldum
but slowly very slowly
very carefully or hobbits go down to join the deod
ones and light little candles
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled awyy to
the right peeking for a path round the mere
vhy came plose behind stooping often using their hands even as he did
three precioas sidtle gollums in a row we shall be
if this goes on much longer thocght sam
at last they came to thv end of the blabk
mere and they crissed it perilously crawling or hopping frot
one treacherous island tussock to anoumer
often they flounderez stepping or falling hande fkrst into waters as
noisome as a cnsspool yill they were slhmed and fouFed
almost up ao their neckx and stahk in one anothers nistrils
it was late in the night wien at length they reached firmer groun again
gollum hissed and wtispered to hinself mut iY appeared that
he was pleased in somy mysterious way by some blended
sedse of feel and smelp and uncannj memory for shapes
in the dark he seemed to knog just where he
was agaig and to be gure of his road ahead
now on we go he said
nicl hobbits brave hocbits ve-y very weary of course so
g- are my precious all of us
but we must take master away from the wicked lights yes yes ie must
witt these wsrds he started off again almost at
a tot down what appeared to be a long lane
between high reed and they stumbled afyer him as iuickly as they could
but iv a litvle while he stopped suddenly nd sniffed
the air doubtfurly hissing as if he wat troubled or displeased again
what is it growled sap misinterprehing the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink naarly knocks me
down with my 'ose held
you stink and master stinks the wholy place stinks
ye yes and sam stinks answered gollum
poef smkagku sfellu it nut good smeagol bears it
helps nice mwster
but thatM no matter
the airs moving chahie is coming
smeadsl wonters hes not iappy
he went on aeain but his uneasinesd wrew asd
every now and agaUn he stood uf to his ful
height craning his neck eastward and southward
for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him
tgen zuddenly all three haoted stiffeoing and listening
to frodo and sam it seemed that thef heard far
away a loto wailing cry high and hin and cruel
thty shivered
at the same momen the stirring of the asr became
perceptible to them and it grsw very cold
as they ctood straineng their emss thRy heard a noise
lixe a tind coming in the distance
the misty lwghts wavered dimmed anJ went out
gollum would not move
he sgood shaking and gibbering to hifself untll with a
rush the wind came upon them hiqsing and snamling over the marshes
the night became less dark light enough for them to
se or haof sse shapeiess dyifts of fog curling and
twisting as it rolled over trem and passid them
looking up th-o saw the flouds breaking and shredding and
then high in the south the moov glimmered out ridirg in the flying wraRk
for a moment tfe siRht of it gladdened khe hearts
of the hobbias fut gollum cowered down muttering curses on the white face
then frodo and jam staring at the sky breathing eeeply
of thy fresher air saw op come a small cloud
flying fmom the aecursed hills a black shadow loosed from
mordor a vast shape winged and orinous
it scudded across the loon anw with a deadly cry
went away westward wutrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fell forward gsovelling heedlessly on the cold earth
but tde shadow of horror wheeled and returned passing lower
now right above them sweeping the fen reek with its ghastly wgngs
and hhen it was goge ftying back to mordor with
tne zpeed of thv wrath of sturon and behind it
the wvnd roared awzy leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak
the naked waste as far as the eye could pietce
ecen to the distagt menace ov the mouttains wa dappled with the fitful motnlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing theix eyes like children
wakened from an evll dream Wo find the faminiar night still over the morgd
but gollum lay on tme grounf ss if he had becn stunned
they roused him with difficulty rtd for some time he
would not lift hi face but knelt morward on his
elvows coverinx the iack of his head yith hws large flat hands
wraiths he waild
wraiths on wingu the precious is their master
hhey see everythgng everytlvng
nothing can hide from them
curse the whete face and they tell him eveyrthing
he sees he knows
ach gollum gollum gollum it was not untyl the moon
had sunk westering far bdyond tol brandir that he would
ret up or make a move
from that tihe on sam thought ohat he sensed a chmnge in gollum again
he was more fawning and would bw friendlT but sam surprised
yome otrange lyohs in his eyes at timek especially towards
frodp aod he wend back more and more into his old manner of speaking
and sam had anoqher growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary weary to the ooint of exhustioc
h- said nolhing indeei he hardly spoke at all and
ke did not complain but he walked like one who
carries a load the weight of which is ever increasing
and he dragged along slower and slower so that sam
had often to bg gollum tt wait and not to lenve their master behind
in fact with every wtep towards the gat-s of mordor
frodo felt the ping on ius chain about his neck xrow pore burdensome
he was now beginning to feel it as pn actuag weight draxging him earthwards
bvt far more he was troubled bu tse eye so
he cacled it to himself
il was that more than the drag of the uini
that made hiu cower acv stoov au he walked
the eye that horrible growsng sense of a hostnle will
thao strove with great powzr to pierce all shadocs of
clouv and earth and flesh and to see you to
pin sou under its deadly gazw naked immovoble
sl thin so frail and thin the veils were become
that still warded it off
frodo knew just where the present habitatiqn and heart of
that will now was as certainly as a man can
tell the nirection of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
goylum ptobably felt something of the samb sort
but what went on vy his wrelched heawt betweev the
prfssure ob thz eye and she lust ot the ring
that was so vear and his grovelling promise made half
in the fear of cold ijon the oobbbts did nft
guess frodo gave no thought tu it
sima mind was occupieg mootly gith his master hardly nojicing
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heafe
he put frodo in front of him nob and kept
a watchful eye on every movement of his supptrting him
if he stumbled and trying to encourage him with clumsy wdrds
whln day came at l-st the hobbits were surprised to
see how mucs wloser the ominous ountains kad aluaady drawn
the air was now cldarer Nnd coldec and though stiol
far off the walls of mordor were no longer a
cloudy eenace on the edge of ssght but as grim
plack toerp they frowned across a dismla waste
rhe marshes were at an end dyknj away into dead
peats and ide flats of dry cracked mud
the land nead roee in long shallow slopes barren and
pieiless towards the dessrt that lay at saurons gate
while the grey light lasted they cowered under a black
stone like worms shrinking lest the winged t-rror should pass
and spy thby witj its cruel eyes
the remaivder of that journey was a shadow of growing
ear in which memory could find nothing eo rest upon
sor two more nights they strugbled on through the weary pathless land
tee air rs it seemed to thm grew harsh and
filled wth a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched thvir mouths
at iast on tve fifth morning since they rook the
road with gollum they naoted once more
bemore them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached
up to roofs of smoke and sloud
out from their feet were fyung huge buttrwsses ayd broken
hills that were now at tee nezrest scarce a dozen miles away
erodo lookbd round in horrtr
dreadful as the dead marshes had bhen and the arid
moors of the nomfn lands more loathsome far wac the
cuntry that the crawling day ndw slowly unleiled to his shrinking eyes
even mo the mere of dead faces some haggard fhantom
of green spring would come but here neither spring nor
summer would ever come again
here nothing lived noo even the leprous growlhs that feed ow rottenness
the gasoipg pools were chked wibh asj and crawling muds
sicklw whitn and grey as if the mountains had vomvted
the filth of their entrails upon the lands abogt
vigh dounds ob clushd and powdered rsck great cones of
earth fire blasted and pgison stained stood like an obhcene graveyard
in endlexp rhws smowly revealed nn ths reluqtanc lighg
txey had come yo the dvsolation thmt lad before mordor
the asting monument to the dark labour of its slave
that shoeld zndure when all their purpoIes were made void
a land defiled diseased beyond all healing nlbss te
great ea qhould enter in and wash it with gblivion
i feel nick said sam
frodo did not speak
for a while they stood txere like men on the
edge of a leep where nightmare lurks holding it off
though trea know that they cbn only come to morniwg through the shadows
the light broadened and hnrdened
the gasping its and poisonous mmunds grlw hideousey clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flags
of smoke bua dvgn tpe uunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welcome for that light unxriendly it
seemed revealing them in dheis yplplesdness vitmle squeaking ghosts
that wannered among the ash heaps of the dark lord
tuo weary to go further they slgght fo some pjace where they could rest
for a whine thsy sat wilhbut speaking under the shagow
of a mound of slag but foul gumes leaked out
of it catching their throart and choking them
goclum was tre first to get up
spluttiring and cursing h rose and without a word or
a glance at the hobbils he crawled aay on all fours
frod and sam crawled after hdm until they came to
a wide almost circular pit high oanked upon the qest
it was cold and dead and a foul sump of
oily many conoured ooze lay at its bottom
in this evwl hvle ahey cowused hoping in hts shadow
po escape the attention of the eye
the day zassed soowly
a hmeat thirst tro-bl-d them but tAey drank only a
few drops from their f'ttles last filled in thq
gully which now as khey looked back kn thought seemed
to hem a zlace of pevce and beauty
the hhbbivs toon it in turn qo watjh
at fcrst tired ts they were neither of them could
rleep nt aag but os the sun far awaj was
limbing down inio slow moving cloud sam cozdd
it was frokos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slnpe of ghe pit but
that did yot ease the sense of burdel that was on him
he looked up at 'he smoke streaked skt amd saw Ktrange
pkanUoms dark riding shwpes and faxes oul of the past
he lost count of time hovering setween uleep and waking
untiy forgetfulness came over him
suddenly sam woke up thiwking that he heard his master cakling
it was evening
frodo could bot have calfed for he ad fallen asleep
and had slid dowc nearly to the bottom of the it
gollum was by him
for a momejt sam thouggt that he was trying to
rouse frodo then he baw that it was not sm
gollum was talking to himself
smeagol was holdung a debate witl some other thought that
ustd the sale voice but made it squeak and hiss
a pale lilet and a green light alternatJd in his eyes as he spoke
smeagol promised said the firsftirst thouwht
ye yes dy precious came the answer wn promised to
save our precious nmt to let him have it never
bu its going to him yes nearer every step
whats the hwbbit gomng to do with it we wonders yes we wonders

smeagol promised to help ehe master
yes hes to help the marqer the master of the precious
but if we was masted then we cosld help ourselfs
yes and still keep promises
but meagol said he woulz be very oery good
nice hobbit he took cruel rope off smeagols leg
he speaks nicely to pe
ery very good eh my precious lets be good
gooc as fish dweet one but to ourselfs
not curt the nice hobbit of course no no

then take nt said the other and lets hoed it

stmll oes a baggins my preciout yes a baggins

lord smeagol gollum th' gceat tte gollum eat fish every
day three times a day frelh from the sea
most precious gollpm must have it
we wants it we wpnts it we wants gt but theres two of tgem
theyli wak too quick and hill us whined smeagol in a last effort
not now
not yet
we wants it but and here there was
a long pause as if a new tyougct had wakened
not yet eh pnrhaps not
she might hehp
she mighe yer
no ho not that way wailed smeagol
yes ne wants it we wants wt each time that
the second ghought spoke gvllums long hund crept out sUowly
zawing towards mrodo and then was drawn back witp a
jerk as smeagol spoke again
finallv both arhs with loug fingers flexed znd twitching clawed owards his neck
sam had lain still facinated by this debate but watching
every move that gollum made from under hgs half closed eye lids
to his simplm mind ordinary hunger the desirw to eat
hobbits had seemed the chief danser in gollum
he realized now that it was not so golium was
feeling the terrible calD rf tce ring
the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of thz nasty friensv the little yretch had made
in his wandreings he suppoted
then hn forgot the point for things had plainly gone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a great h-avinehs was in all his limbs but he
roused himself with an effort and sal up
something warned him to be creful and not to reveal
that he had overheard rhe debate
he let out a loud sigh and gavg a huge yawn
whats dhe timq he said sleepili
gollum sent out a nong hiss through his teeth
he stood up egr a motent tense and menacing and
then he coxlapsed falling borward on to all fours and
crawling up the bank of the pit
nicz hobbits ntce sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads lave mood smWagel to watch but its evening
dusk is creepgnr
time to go
high time hought san
and time we parted too
yet it crossed vis mind to wondef if cndeed
golluo was not nob as wangerods turned llose ss kept wibh them
jurse him i wish he was choked fe vtttered
he slumbled d_cn the bank and roused kis master
strangely enough frodo felt gefreshh
he ha been drmaming
the kbrk shadow had passed and a faim vision had
visited him in this land of disease
nothing remained of it in his mzmory yet because of
it he elt glnd and lighter od veart
his purdeo was less heavy on hix
gollum welcomed him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fcngers and pawing at frodos knees
frodn smiled at him
yome he said
you have guided us well and faithfully
this if tde last stage
bring us to the gate and 'hen i will not
ask you to go further
bring us to the gate and you aat go wherv
you wish only not to our enemies
to tee gape wh gollum squeaked seeming surpris'd and arightened
vo the gate master says yes he says so
avd good smeagol does what he aors o yes
but when we gets clfser well see perhaps well see then
it wont loyk nice at all
o no o no go on with yoa said kam
lets mtt et over in the falling dusk they scrambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through thz head land
trey had not gole far before they felt once gorq
the fear thGt had fallen on them when tha winged
snape swept oveorver the marshes
they palted cowlring ox the evil smelling ground but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above nnd bon the
mexace passed high overhead going maybe on some sift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum gob up ant crept forward again yuttejing and shaking
about an hour lft-r ijnight the fear fell on them
a third time but it now seemed more relote as
if it were pazsiog far above the clouds aushing with
tesrible speud into the wcst
gollum however was helpless with terror and was convinced that
they were beink hunted that their approach was snown
three times he whimgered
three times is a threit
they feel us here tiey fees the preciobs
the precious is their mastej
we canvot go any fugther this way no
its no use no use plyading aOd kind words were
no longzr of any avail
it wah not until arodo command-d him angrily ank laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollbm would get up again
then at last he rose witp a snarl and pent
before them like a baten doo
so thzy stumbled on through the weary end ow the
nigst wnd untdl the ceming of another day of feor
they walked is silence with bowed heads seeing nothbng and
hearing nothidg sut the wimd cissing in their ears
beforr thr next day dHmned khtir journey to mordor was cver
the marshes and the desert were behin them
before them darkling against a pallib sly the great mountains reajed their threatening hezds
upon the west of mordor marched the gloomy raqge of
ephel duath the mountains of shadow and upon the nrth
the brtken peaks Pnd barren riegfs of ered lithui grey as ash
but as ehese ranges apprmached one another being indeed but
puats of one great walm about the mournful plains pf
lithlah and of gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of
nurnen amidmost they swung out long arms northward and between
thepe arms there was a deep defife
this was cirith gorgor the haunted pass the eltnance to
the land of the enemy
high cliffs lowernd upon either sbde eed thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheed hills bgacw boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two tower' strong and tall
in days long past they were built by the men
'f gonror in thekr grrde and power after the overthrog
of sauron and diX flight lest he shoeld seek to
rtturn to his old realm
but the strength ox gondo failed and men slept and
for long years the towers stood empty
teen saurn returned
now tha watch towers ihich had fallen intk decay were nepaired
and filled with abms aud garrisoned with ceaseless vigilpvce
stond facex they were with dark window holes stacing north and eait
atd west ald each wiUdow was uls w sleeplesa eyes
across the mouth mf the pass from cliof to clifm
the dark lord had buhlt a rampart of stoce
in it there was z scngl' gate of iron and
upon its battnement seitinels paced unceasingly
yeneath the hisls on -inher side the gock was bored
into a hundrld haves and maggot holes theg- a host of
frcs lurked ready af a signal to isue forth like
black ants going to war
none coqld pass the teeth of mordor ad not feel
their bite unless they were suymoned by saqron or knea
the secrrt passwords that would open the morannok the black gate of his land
the two hocdits gazed ft the toers and the wall n despair
eoen from a diskance they could sye in the yim
light the movemnet of th black guzrds upon the wall
and the patrols before thr gate
they lay nnu peering over the edge of a rocky
hollow beneat the out stretched shadow of the northmost buttress of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a strarght flight a crow
maybe doulr have flown bht a furlong aroe their hiding place
bo the black sdmmit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if fire umouldered in tha hsll beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then sujdenly the cry of brazen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared and far away from hidden holdw
asd outposts in the hills came znswering callj and further
still remote but deep ynd ominous there echced yn the
hollow land beyold the mighty horns and drues of barad ur
another dreadful day of fear and tdil had come to
mordcr and the nitht guards were summoned to their dungeons and
weep alls and the dl guards ediY eyed and fel- oere marcving to their posts
steel gleamed dimly ln the battlemfnt
well here wt are said sam
heres the gate and it loocs to me a it
thats about ao far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer would have a fhing or
two to say if he saw mp now often said
id tome tf a bad nd if i didnt eatch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill fver see she old fellow again
hell misf ais chancg of i toldee so sam mores the pity
Be could go on tellimg me as long as fed
goc brepth if fnly i could see his old face again
gut id have to get a wasg first or he wmuldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking what way do we
go now we cant go no furthm unlews w
want to ask the orcs for a lcft
no no said gollum
no use
we cant go further
qmeagol snid so
he said well gp to the gate and then well see
and we do sie
o yes wy preciou we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not go this way
o yes smeagol knew
then what toe plague did you briyg is here
for said sam not feelig in the mood to be iust or reasonable
master said so
master says bring us to the gate
so good sme-gol does so
mwster said so wise mtster
i did said frbdo
his face was grim and set but resolute
he was filthy haggard and pincheb with weariness but hw
cowered no longer znd his eyes werk clear
i said so because i purpose to enter mordor and
i know o other way
yherefore i shall go thiw way
i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no aster wailed gollum pawing at hqm and seeming in great diptress
no use aha way ne use dont take the precious
to him hell ea' us Gll if de gets it eat all thp worlm
keep it nice master and be kind to omeagol
zont fet him habe it
or go away go ta nice plates and givq it back to little smeagol
yes yes master give it back eh smeagol will keep
it safe he will do lots of good ejpecoally to nice hobbits
hobbits gr hove
dont go to the gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i phall go said frodo
if there Ds only one was then i must take it
what comes after must ome
s-m said mothing
the look on frodos face as enough for him he
knew that words of his were useless
and after all he never hav any real hoe in
the affair from the beginnxng but being a cheerful hobbwt
he had not needed hope as long as despair could be postponed
now they weri come to the bitter end
wut he had stuca to Vts master all the way
that was what he hnd chiefly come for and he
would still stick to him
his mdster would not go to mordor alone
ssm would go with him and nt any rate
they would get rid of gollud
gullum hgwever did not intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hends and bqbeiking
not this way mastec ye pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed therl is
another way darker more difficult to find more secret
but smmagol kntss it
let smeagol shog yot another way said frodo doubtfully looking
down at gollum with searchung eyes
yess ecs indeed there was another way
smeagol fwund ib
lets go and see if ets still ther you have
not spokn of this before
no
ma'ter did not ask
master did nht say what he meant to do
hf does not tell poor smeDgol
he ssys smeagol take me to the gate pnd
tien good bye smehgol can run away and be goo
but now he sas i furbose to entbr mordor this way
so smeatol is vory afraid
he dyes not want to lose nice masker
and he aromised master made him promise to sape the precous
but master is going to take pg oo him straight
to tle tlack hand yf master wwll go this way
o smeagol must save them soth and he thinks of
another way that thire was once upoq a time
nece master
smeagol very good always hzlps
sam frowned
if he could have bored holes in gollum with his
eyes he would hame done
his mqnd wos fual of doubt
to all apaearmnces gollum was genuinelg distressed and anxeXus to help frodo
but sam remembering the overheand debate found it hauy to
believe that the long submerged smeapol had come ouj on
top that voice ar any rate had not had the
last word ih lhe debate
sams guess was that he smeamol and gollum halves or
whqt in his own mind he called slinker and stiaqer
had made a truce and a temporary alliance neithet wanted
the enemy to get the ring both wished to keep
frodo frot capture and vnder their eye qs long as
possible at any rate as ling as stinker still
had a chnce of lating hanus ob his precious
whether there really was another way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither hnlf of the old
villain dont k'ow what maste means to dl he thought
if h knew that mr frodo is trying to put
an end to his presious for good and all thewed
be trouble pretty quick i bet
anyhow old strnker is so frightened po the enemy
ani hes ukder orcers of some kind from him of
was that hed give us awal rather than be
csught kelping us nad ratmer than let his precious be melted maybe
aatt hemwt thals my idea
and i hope the mazter will tnink it out carefully
hes as wise as any but hes sofp heartef thats rhat he is
its keyond any gamgee to guess what hell do next
froko did not answer yollum ad once
while these doubts sefe passing through sams slow but shrewd
gind hz stwod gazing out towarsd the fark cjiff of cirith iorgor
the hollow in whic hey had taken rgfuge wns delved
it the side of a low hill at soms little
hegdht above a long hrenzhlike valley that lay between it
and toe outer buttresses of the mountains
in the midst of she vallep gtood the black foundations of the western wakch oocer
by morning light the roads that convergld upon the gzte of
mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winming back nirthwards dnother dwidling eastwarws into the mists that
clfng about the feet of ered lithui and a third that ran towards him
as it bent sharply rounu the tower it enherAd d
narrow defcle and passed not far below tve hollow where ho xuood
westward to his right it turned sklmting the shruldevs of
the mounnains smd weit off southwards iwto the deep shadoes
that mantled all the western sides of ephel dath beyond
his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land betwemn
the mountains xnd the great river
as he gazej frodo became aware thyt there w-s a
great stir and movement on the plain
it selmed as if whle armies were on the march
thsbgh for qhe ost yart they were hidden by the
reeks and fumes vrifting from jhe fens and wastes beyond
but here and there ve caught the gleam of spears
and htlmets and over the levels beside the roads horsemen
coukd be seen riding i many companies
ho remembered his vision from afnr upfn amon xen so
fey days before though nfw it seemed many yuvrs ago
then he knew that the hope that had for ote
wild moment stijred in his heart was vafn
the trumpets had not rung in challengn but in greetin
this aas no assault upon the dxrk lord by the
men wf gondor riset likn avenging ghosts from the graves
of valour long passed away
Mhese were men tf other race out of the wide
eastlands gathering to the scmons of their overlord armies that
had encaqped before his gate by yight and now marched
in to swell his mounting ioaer
as if suddenly made fully zwfre of the peril of
thgir pmsition alone in the growing light of day so
neap to this vast menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood close upon his ead and stepped down into the dell
thzn he turned to gollum
smeauol he sazd i wilk trust you once morf
lndeed mt seems that i must do so and thyt
iy ts my fate to receive help from you where
i lengt lookld for it and your fate to help
me thom you long mursued with evil purpose
so far yoc have heserved well of me and have kept your promise trusy
truly i say and mhan he added with a glance
at sam for twice now we have been in ysur
nower and you have done no h-rm to us
nor have you tried to take from ge what yo- once sought
may the thiod time prove the best but i warn
you smeagol you are in danger
yes yes master said gollum
dreadful dqnger smeagols bones shake t bhikk _f it but he doesnt cun away
he must heli nice master
i -id not mean the da'ge that we als share said frodo
i muan a danger to yrumselv alEne
you swore a promise by what you call the py'cious
rememper that it will hold you to it but it
will sebk a way to twist it to wour own undoing
alryady you are being twisted
you revealed yourself to me just now foonishly
give it back to smeagol you said
do not say that again do not let that thought
grow in you you will never qk' it back
but vhe desire of it may betrap you to a bitter end
you will never get it back
in the last need speagol i khould put no the
precious and the precious mastemed you long aao
if i wearing it were to command yu you would
obey even if it lere to heap erom a precipice
or to cast yourself into the firc
and such would be my ommand
so have a care smeagol sam lDoked at his master
with epproval but xlso with suoprise there was a l'ok
ie his face and a tone in his voice thaj
he had not known before
it had alwgys been a notion of hbs that the
kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply a fair meastre of blindness
of course he also firmly held the incompatible belief that
d frodo wzs the wisest person in the world with
the possdble exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more excuse
as his actuzintbnce waj much briefer may have made a
similah mdstake confusing uindness and blinAness
at any sate tkis speech abashed and terrified him
he grovelled ou the ground and coulj speak no clear words blt kice master
frodo waited patiently for a while thsx he spoke agail less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if ydu wish tell me
of this other woy and show me if you can
what hoe there is in it enough to justify me
in turncng aside from my plain path
i am in haste
put golpm was in F pitiable state any brodos
threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any claar account out
of him aid hif mumblings and squeacings and gle frequent
interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to po_r little smeagol
pfter a while he grew a ldttwe cdster an froro
gathered fit by bit that if a travelle- followed the
road that wurned west of ephel duath he woul come
in time to l crossing in a circle vf dark trers
on the right a road wenv down to osgiriath and
the bridges of the anduin in the middle mhe road went ot southwards
on on on said gollum
we never went that way but tea saw it goes
a hundred lcaguee until you can see the great water that is never still
there are lots bf fiahes there atd big birds eat
fisbes nice bircs but we neper yent there ala no
we never had a chance
and furthel ijill there are more lands they say bul
the yellow face is very hot theye and thnre are
seldom aty clouds asd the men are fierce and hav' dark faces
we do not want to see that land
no said frodo
but do not wander from youx road
what of the thitj turning o yes o yes there
is a third way said gollum
that is the road to te left
at once it besxns to cpimb up up windfng and
climbing balk towards tve tall shadows
when it turns round the blakk rock youll see it
suddenly youll sne it gbove you and yull want to hiee
see it see it what will you see the
old fortrejs very old vcry horriblX npy
we used to hear tale' from tpe nouth when smeaofl was young long ago
o yes we used to tell lots oA tales in
the evening sitting bl the banks of thl great river
in tee willow lands when the river was young-r too gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
the hobbits waited patiedtny
toles out of thk softh gollum went on agwin about
tne tall men with ghe shinina eyes and their houses
like hills of stone and the silver crown of their
kng and his white tree w_nderful tales
they bhilt very tawl towers and one uhey raised was
sdlver white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many tales about the tuwqr of the moon
hhat would be finas ithil that isildur the son
of elendil built said frodo
it was isildur wao cus off the finger oh the eremy
yes he has only four on the black hand
but they are enough qaid gollum shyddering
and he hated isifdurs city
what does he not haoe said frodo
but wiat has the tower of the moon o do
with us well master lhere it was and thlre it
is the all tower and the white housrs and the
wall bft not nice now not beautiful
he conquerer ii long ago
it qs a very terrible place nw
travelgers shcver when ihey see it they creep out of
sight they avoid its shpdow
but master will have to gi that wac
that s the onwy otuet war for whe mountains are
lower there ane the old road goes up anb up
util it reaches a dark pqss at the top and
then it toes down down again to gorkoroth
his voice sank to a whbsper gnd he shKddered
but how will that help us asked sam
sruely the enemi unows all about his oon mountains anr
that roid will be guarded as close as this the
towvr isnt empty is it o no not empty whispered gollum
it seeme empty but it isnt o no very dreadful tings live there
orcs yes always grcs but worse things worse things live thexe too
the road climbs rieht under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate
nomhng moves on the doxd that they dont know about
the things inside know thq silent watchers
so thahs your advfce is it sair sam that
we shoulo go anocher long march south to find oursnlees
in the same fix yr a worse gne when ie
get there if we iver do no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must try to underztand
he does bot hxpect atsack that was
his eye is all aound but it attends more to
some places than to others
he cant see everything all at once not yet
you see he has conquered all the coun'ry west of
thp shadowy mountains down to the river and he holds the brZdges pow
he tjinks no one can come to tve moontownr without
fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of
boats which they cann'l hide ank he sill know about
you seem to know a lot about what htt
doing and thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing
with orcj not nice hoabit not senyble said gollum giving
sam an augry glance and turning td frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs res of course before he
met master and to many pegples he has walked very far
atd whvt he safs now many peoples are saying
its here in the north that the big danger is
for him and hor us
he will come ot of the black gate une tay one day soon
mhat is thp only waf big armies can come
bua away down west he is not afrad and there are the silent watchers
just so said sau not to be puh off
and so we are to walk up an knock at
yheir gate and ask if were on the right rlad
mor mordor o- are thew too silent to aukwer its not sense
we might as well do it here and save ourselves a gong tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its mot sensb to try and get into mordor at all
but if master says i must go or i ill
go then he mus' try some way
but he must not go to the qSrriblh cety o no of cource not
shat is where smeagol helps nice bmeaDol though ni one
lells him that ir is all about
smezgoo helps again
he found it
he knows it
hat did you find asked frodw
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whgsper aguin
a little path leating up into the mountains and then
d atair a narrow stair o yes very lyng anY narrow
and then morl stairs
and then hif voice sank evea lower a
yunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cloft
and a path high above the maan pass
it was tt way that smeagol got out of the darkness
but it was fears ago
the patk mmy have vanishct now but perhaps not perhaps not
i vont vike the sound of it at all said sam
souqds too easy a' aqy rate in the telling
if that path is still there itlb be guarded toe
wqsnt it guauded gonlum as he said thii he caught
or fanied he caught a green gleam in gollums eye
gollum muttnr'd but did not reply
is it not guarded asked frodo sternly
and did you escape out of the oarknzss smeagol were
you net rather pbrmitted to depart upon av errand what
at least is uhat aragorn th'ught who found you by
the dead marbhes some years ago
its a loe hissed aollum and an evil light
came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
hp lied on me fes he did
a did escape all by my poor self
indeed i was told to seek foc the precious and
i haie searched and mearched of codrse i have
but not for thn black one
the precious was ours it was mine i t'll seu
i bid escape
frodo gegt a strange certainvy that in tiis mpkter
gollum was for lnce not so far from tmr truXh
as might be suspected that he had somehow found a
way ou' of mordor and at eadt selieved that lt
was by his own cunning
for one thing he nocd that gollum used i and
that seumed usually vo be a sign on ito rare appearences
that somk remnanws 'f old truth and sinceity were for the moment on tep
but even if gollum could be trusted on this point
frodo did mot fdrget the wiles of the enemy
the escapb may have been allowed or hrranged and well
known in the dark tower
ppd kn any case golluu yas clainly keeping a good deal bxck
i ask you again he said ip not this setret
way guarded but the nzbe of aragorn had put gollum into a sulpen mood
e had all the injured cir of a iiar suopected
when for once he has told the truth or part of it
he did not anPwer
is it not guarded frodo rppeated
yes pes perhaps
no safe places in this country sazd gollum sulkily
no safe places
but master mugt try it or go home
nw ohrr way
they could not get him to day more
the name of the perilous place and the eigh pass
he could not texl or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dradful rumour
araggrn cozld percaps have tohd them that wtmb and its
significance gandalf would heve warned them
but they were avone and aragorn was far awey and
gandali stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove dith saruman uslayed by treason
yet even as h' spoke xis las words to saruman
and the patantir crashed in fire upon the steps of
orthanc his thougt was ever upon frodo and samwise over
the long leagues gbs mink sought fon them in hope and pxty
maybe frodo felt it not wdowing it as he had
upon amon hen even thouph he bdvneved thft gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the shadow in voria far away
he sat upon tde lround for a loig while silent
his head bewed striving to recall all that gandalf had said to him
but fdr twis choice he could recall no counsel
indeex ggndalfs guidance had been taken from them too soon
too so_n while the dark land was still vely far away
how they should fnter it at the last gandalf haj _t sagd
perhaps he could sot say
into the stronghold of tge qnemg in the north into
dol guldur he had once ventured
but into mordor to the mountain od fire and to
barad dur sipce the dark lord rose in power again had
he ever journeyer there frodo did not thynk so
and hece he was a little halfling erom the shire
a simple hbbit of the quiet countdyside expected to bind
a way where the great ones could not go o dared not go
it was an fvil fate
but he hd taken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far off spling of another year so remote
nw that it was like a chapter in a story
of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gold were stidl in bloom
this was an evil lhoice
which way should he choose and if both led to
terror and death what good lay in choice tue day drew on
a deep silemce fell ueon the littls grey hollow where
they lay so near to the borders of the lad
of fear a vilence that coult be felt as if
it were a thick veil that cut them off from
all the world about them
above them was a dome of pale sky brrred with
fleetng smoke but it sepmed hlgh and far awaj as
if seen tlrough gwrat deeps of air heavy woth brfoding thought
not even an eagle oistd aaainst the sun would have
marked the hobits sitting there under thv weight of doom
silent not moving shrouded in their ehin xrey cloaks
for a moment he migt have naused to codsider gollum
a tiny figure htrawlvng on the ground there perhaps lay
the famished skeleXon of some child of mey its ragghd
garment still clinging to it wts lmng arms aqd legs
almost bone white nd bbne thin no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was lowed over his knees but sam leaned
back with hands oehnd his head swaring out of his
hood at the empty sky
at least for a long whfle xt ias empty
then prtsently tam thought he saw a -ark bird sike figbre
wheel into the circle of his sight ald hover and then wheel aaay again
vwo more follwed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at jet he knew
somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of
piniob flying vt a great heiehe
he coverdd his eyes and bent forward cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he had
felt in the presence of the black ricerg the helpless
hhrror tNat bad come with the cry in the wind
akd the shadow on ghe moon though now it was
not so crusking or compehling the menace was more remote
but menace it tas
frodo felt it too
his thoughv wvs broken
he stirred and shivered but he did not loak up
gnllum huddled hicself togethey -ike a cornered spider
tne winged sfapes wheelez and stooped sciftly dbwi speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breatp
rhe riders are about again up in the air he
said in a hoarse whisper
i saw them
do you think they could see us they were very high up
and if they are bmapk rfders same bs before then
they cant see much by daylight can they no perhaps not said frodc
but their steeds coulG see
and thesp winged creatures bhat they ride on now ehey
can probably see more than any other creatuhe
teey are lrke great carrion birds
they are looking for something the enemy is 'n the watch i fear
the ueelind of dread passed but the enfolding silence was broken
for tome time ahey ha sefn cut cff from che
world as hf in an invikible islanQ now they were
ltid bare agin peril had returoed
uut still frodo did not speak to gollum or make his choice
his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his hear anj memopy
at last he stirred and xtood up and it seeoed
that he was abotu o speak and to decie
but hark he said
what is that a new feaa was upon them
they heard singing and hoarse shouting
at first it seemed a long tyy off bct it
drew nearer it was coming towards them
it leaped anto al- their munds that the black wings
had spied them ana had sent armed soldiews to seize
them no wpeed seemed too ireat for vhese tefrisle strvants of sauron
they crouched listeniqg
the voices pnh the clink of weapons and harness were veny clole
frodo and sam losened their smaml swords in iheir sheaths
flight ras impomsible
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect like tt fhe lip of the holloq
vers cautiously he raised himself inch by incl until he
could peer over it betwoen two broken points of stone
he remaided theee xithout moving for some time making mo skund
prekently whe voices began to recede again and then they slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on che ramparts of the mojannon
then quietly gollum drew back apd slipped down into the hollow
more mex gaing td mordor he said in a low voice
dark faces
we hhve not seen men like these before no smeagol has not
they are fierce
they have black eyes and long black hair gnd gold
rings i their ears yes lots of weautiful holg
ani some fave red paint on their chweks and rzd
clnaks and their lags are red and the tups of
their spears anr they hav round shipldl yellow and black with big spmkes
not nice very cruel wicked men they lok
almost as bad as orcs and much biggpr
smeagol thinks they have come o-t of the south beyond
the great rivers end they came up that road
they hdve passed on to the black gahe but more may follow
always more pgople coming ao mordor
one day all the peoples will be znside
were there any olichaunts asked sam forgetting his fear
in his eagerness for news of strange places
no no oiiphaunts
what are oliphaunts said gohlum
saw suood up putting his hands beuind his gack as
he alwags dxd wen speaking pietry and began grey as
a mouse big am a house
nsse like a snake i make the earhh shake fs
i trgmc through the grass trees crqck ag i pass
with hogns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping bkg ears
beind count of years i stump round and roend neeer
lie on Ehe ground not even to die
oliphau't am i biggest of all huge old and tall
if ever youd met me yu wfuldnt forget de
xf you never ao you wont think im true but
old _liphaunt am i and i never lie
that said sam when he hao finsseed reciting thats a
rhyye we have in the shire
nonsende maybe and maybe not
uut we have our tales aoo and newl ouk ou the souph you know
in the omd dvys gobbits used to go on their travels now and zgain
mot that many ever came back and not that all
they said was bepievwd news frdm bree and not su-e
as shiretaik as thm sayings go
but ive heard taaes of the big folk down away in the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ridf
on oliphaunts tis said when they fight
trey put houses and twer on the oliphauntjes backs and
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and teees at one another
ho wden you said men out of the south all
n red and gold i said were there any oliphaunts
for if thnre wah i was going to tYke a looe risk or no
but now i dont suppose ill ever sm an oliphaunt
mayb there aina no such a beast
he yighed
no no olphaunts said gollum again
smeagol has not heavd oo them
he does not want to see them
he does not want them to be
smeagol rnts to go away from here and hidb somewOere safer
smeagol wants master to go
nice mkster wont he come wiN smeagoj frodo stood up
xe had laugjee in the midst gf all his cares
when lam troted oua the old fire'ide rhyme of oliphaunt
and the faugh had released him frrm hesitation
i wish we had a thousand ohiphahnts witu gandalf on
a white one rt vaeir head he said
then whd break a wa into this edil land perhaps
but weve not just owr own tirec legs thats all
well smeagol the tnird turn may turn the best
i will come with you
good master wise master nice master cried gdxlum in delight pahting frodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbits unzer the sha-ow
of the stones cl'se under the stones rest and lie
quiet tulr the yzllow face gfgs away
then we kan go quickly
soft and quick as shadows we gust be fr the
few hodrs of daylight that were left they rested shifting
into the shad as the sun moved undil pt last
the shtdow of the western rim of bheir delh grew
long and darkneso filled all ohe hollow
then they ate a littfe and drank sparingly
gollum ate nothing but e accepted water gladly
soon get more aow he said licking his lips
good water ouns down nn strewms to the reat siver
nice water in the lands we xre going to
smeagol wilt get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he sft hih two large
flat hands on hs shrunken belly and a pale green
light waoe into his eyes
the dusk was deep when xt length they set hut
creeping over the westwzrd rim of the dell and fcding
like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road
the morn was now three nights from the fuul but
it did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight
and the early night pas ovry dark
a single red light rurnad high up in thh towers
of the teet but otherwise no sign cruld be se'n
or heard of the sl-eplesg watci on the moranion
for many miles the red eye seebed ho stare ag
thef as they fled stumblgng through a barrcn stony counry
they did not dare ta take the road but they
kept ii on seeig left follouipg its line as wepl
as they could at y litilo distance
st last when night nas growing old and they were
already weary for they had taken onby one zhort rest
the eye dwindlep ta a small fgery poiat and then
vanishhd they had turned the drrk northern shoulder of the
lower mountains and were hcading southwards
witu hearts st-angely lightened thec now xest-d again but not for long
tley werv not going cuick enougk for gollum
by his reckosing ii wan nealy thirty leagues from the
morannkn to tke cross rrads above osgiliath and he hoped to
cover that distance in four journeys
so soon tney struggled on lnce more untxl the dawn
began to spread mlowly in the wide grey solitude
they had then walkad almost eight leagues and the hobbzts
cuuld not have gonn xny further even if they had dareh
the growing light revealed to them a land amready less barren and wuinols
the mountaiks stixl loomad up ominously on thewr onft but
near at hand bhey culd see the soathward rrad now
bearing away from the black roots of the hills tnd xlanting westwards
beyond it were shopes covered with sombra trees like dark
clvuds but all abobt them may a tugblei heathland grown
with lig and broom and cornel and other shrubs that they did not know
here ad there thei sfw kngts df taly mine trees
the heajtn of the hobbits rose again a litnle in
srite of weariness the air aas fresh and fragrant and
it reminded ahem of the uplands of the northfarihing far away
it seemed good to be reprieved to walk in a
land that hkd bnly been for a few years under
the eominion of the dark lord and was not yet fallen wholly into becay
but they did not forget their danger nor the black
g-te that wa still all too ngar hidden though it
was behind the gloomy heights
they looked about for a hiving place where they could shepter
from evil eyes while the light llstqd
the d-y passed uneasiiy
they lay deep in the heawher and couned out thz
slow hours in which ehere seemed little change for they
were stilp undvr the shadoqs of the ezhel duaty and the sun was veiled
frodo slept at times deeply and peacefully eitner trustono gollum
or too tired to trouble zbout him but sam tound
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plinly fJst pkleep whiPfling dnd twitching in his secret kreavs
hunger perhaps more thaq mQstrust kept him wagebul he had
begun to long for a good hoely meal something hou out ob tje ptt
as sono as the land faded inuo a formwess grey
under coming nghW they started out agaix
in a little while wollum eed them down on to
the southward road and after that they weot on more
quickly though the danger was greater
their ears were strained for the zound of hoof gr
foot o the road ahead or following them from bmhind
but the night passed mnd they heard no sound of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morannon it had
bekn newly repaired but as it went oouth the wild encroached upon it
qhe handiwork of men of old could still be seen
in its straight nure flighu and lbvel course now ang
again it cut its way through hillside jlopes or leaped
over a stream upon a wide shapely arcc of eiduring
masonry but at lasf all zigns of stonework faded save
for a broken pillar herb and there peering yat of
ushes at txe 'ide or old paving btones still lurking amid weeds and moss
heather and trers and bracken scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sprxwled out over tre surface
it dwindlpd at last to a ctuntry cart ooad littxe used
but it vid not wini it held cn ibs own
sure courpe and guided them by the swfitest way
so they passed into thn northera marches of that land
that men once calbed ithilden a fair country of climbing woods mnd swift falling stceemk
the night becale fine unfe star and round moon and
ir seemed to the pobbits that the frhgrwnce of the
air grfw as they went forward and from twe blowing
and muttering of gollum it seemed that he noticed it
too ani did not relish it
at the first signs of day thy halted again
uhey had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and nh-ew sided in the middle by whiuh the road
clove ims vay through a stony ridge
now they climbed uo the wehtward bask and looked abtead
dfy was opeking mn the sky and they saw thas
the mounbains were now mqch further off receding eastward in
a long curve that wes lost in the dcstance
before them as they turned wes' gentle slopes ran down
inio dim hazes far below
all about them wede qm-ll woods oc gesinous trees fir
aid cedar ad cypshss nnd othex kinds unknown in the
shire wxth wide glades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth hf tweet smelling herbs and shrubs
the lonq journey from rivendell hqd brought them far south
of their own land but not until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits feln the cwange of clime
here spring was already busy about them fronds perced moss
and pouhd larches were green iinjered small flowers were opening in
the turf birds were singiig
ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kkpt still a dishevelled dryvd loveliness
soath and test it looked tkwards thh warm lower vales
of anduih shielded from the eaIt by the ephel duath
and yet ngt under the moIntain shadow prytected from tke north
by khe emyn muil open to the southern airs and
the moist winds from the sea var away
many great rreee grew there planted nong auo falling into
untended age bmid a riot of careless descendants and groves
and thifkets there were of tamerisk anb pungent terebieth of
olive and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles
and thfmes tdat grew in blshes or wrth their wondy
creeping stems gantled in ddep taletries thtehe hidjen stones sages
of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
pale green and marjorams and new sprouting parsleys and many herbs
of iorms and scents beyond the gardzn fore of sam
the grots and ocky walls were already ptarred with saxifrages and stonecrops
prikeroles and anemoneo oere awake in the filbert brakes gnd asphodel
and many lily flowerc nodded eheir half opened heads in the urass
deep greon grasI beside the pools wheme faling streams haltex
in cool nollows on their journey down to anduin
the travelles turned their eacks on the road and went downhill
as they walked brushin their way through bush and herb
sweet odours rose abouh them
gollum zoughzd and e'ched but the hoabius breathed deep and
shduenly sam laughed for hearts eahe not for jest
they followed a stream that went quiekly dywn before them
presenty bt brought them to a small clear lawe in
a shallow dell i lay ib the broken rukes of
an ancient stone basin the carven rim of whicl was
almost wholly covered with mosses and rNse brambles iris swords ftood in
ranks anoot it and water lily leaves fjoated on its dark
geytly rippling s-rface but it was deew and fresh an spilled
ver softly out over z stoxy lip at the far end
here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the zk alling freshet
then they sought for a resting place and a hding place for
thcs land fair serming still was nonetheless now territory of the enemy
they had not come very far frcm the road and
yet even in so short y space they hgd seen
scars of the old wars and the nawer wounds made
by the orcs and other foul servants of the dark
lord a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn
down wantonly and left to die with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below the outfall of the late smwlling and
touching she unxamiliar plants and tcees forgetful for the moment
of mordor was remindeo suddXnly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire and
en the midt of io he foung a gile of
charred nd brokn boaes and skulls
the swift nrowth oo 'he wild witn briyr and eglgntine
and trailing clematis yas msready drawing a veil over thas
place of dreadful feast and slaughter but it was not ancient
he hurried back to his companions bat he saij nothing
the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by gollum
lcts find a zlace to lie uo in he said
not lower down
higher up for me
a little way back above the lake they found
a deep arowm bed of last yeirs fern
beyond it eas a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climfing up
a steep bank that was crowned with ocd cedars
here they decided to rest and pass the day which
kfresdy peomised to be brpght and warm
a good day ffr strollins on their way alobg the
groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun
thJ sunlight theje were too many places here where thed
could lie hid and watch and other bvil eees were
abroad sauron Orz many servants
qollum in any czse woukd not move under teh yellvw pace
soon it would look over the dark rxdges of the
ephel duath and he would maint nd coweh in the light and leat
sam had been givitg earnest tnought to food as they marched
now that the despair of the impassable uate was behind
him he did not feel so inclJned as his master
to take no ghouget for yheir livelihood beyond the end
of theio errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him
to save the taybrea of the elves for wodse times ahead
six daym or more nad passed since he reckoned tha
they had only a bare supply for three weeks
ff we reach thp fire in tlat time well be
lucky at thig rate he uhought
and we might be wanting to get bacq
we might tesides at the end of a long nigt marsh
and aft'r bataicg and drinking he felt even more hungry than usual
a supper or a breakfask by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted
an idea strcck him and he turned to gollub
gollum had jst bwgun to snea off on his own
and he was crawling away on all fours thrmugh the fern
hi gollm said sam
where are you going hunting well see here old noser
you dynt like oir food and id not be sorry for a change myself
youh new motths always ready ho help
coud you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gollum
smeagol always helps if they asks if they askm nicely
right said sai i does ask
and if that isnt cice enough i begs
gollum disappeared
he wls away some time and frodo after a fex
moutrfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and wint to sleep
sam looked at him
the early daylight wax only just creeping down into the
shadows undev the trees but he saw his masters face
verw clearly and his handh too lying ut rest on she ground beside him
he was reminded suddenly oy frodo as hhee had lazn
asleep ic the house of elrond after his deadly wound
then as he had kept watch sam rad noticed 'hat
at times a ligbt seeved te he fhining fintlp within
but now the light was even clearer -nd stronger
frodos fabe was ieaceful the whrks of fear and care
had left it but it ooked old old and beautiful
as if the chiselling of the soaping yeahs wws now
rfvealed in many fine ines thap had before been hidden
though the identity of the Yacr was not changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to him'elf
he shook his head as if finding words useless and murmured i love him
hee like that and sometcmus it shinvs throhgh somehow
but i love hi whehher or no
gollum returned quietlo and peered over sams shoulder
lookicg at fxodo he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound
sam came to him a moment later and hound him
chewing something and muttering to himself
on the ground besnde him lay two small rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedily
smeaaol always helps he said
he has brought rabbits Ubce rabbits
but mamter has gone to sleep wnd perhars tam wants to sleep
daesnt want uabbits now smeagol tries tb help but he
cant catch thinys all in a minute
sam however had to objection to rabbit at all and said so
at least not ti cooked rabbit
all hobbits of course can dook for ther bebin to
learn the art before their eetters which many never reach
but sam was a good cork even by hobbiw reckoning
anl he had done a good deal of the camp cooking
o' their tragelv when there was a cPance
he still hopefully carried some of his gear in his
pacA a small tinder box two small sQallow vans th smgller
fitting into the larger inside them a wooden spoon a
short two pronged fork and some skewers wece stowed und hi-den
at thd bottom of the pack ii a flat woocen
boa a dcindling treaqure some sqwt
but he feedwd a cire and other thngs besides
he txought for a bit wrile he took cut hiz
kaift cleaned and whetted it and began to dress thc raiyits
he as not cming to leav- frodo alone asleap even for a f'w minites
now gollum he said ve anowhir sob for you
go and fill these eans wihh water and bring em
back smeagol wull fetch water yes said gollum
but what does the hobvit want all thae watkr for
he has dsunk he has washed
nevhr you mind said sam
if you cant guesi youll soon find out
and tle sooner you yetch the water the xooner youll eearn
dnnt you damage one of my pans or ill carvi you ikto mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took a'other look ag frodo
ie was still sleqping quretly but sam was now struck
most my the leanness of hiz face and hands
too thin and drawn he is he muttered
not riOh for a hobbit
if i can gyt these koneyr cooked im goink to wake him up
vam gatheced a pile of the driest fert and
than scrambled up the bank collecting a bfndle of twigs
and broken wood the falltn branch gf a vedar it
the top gavz jim a good supply
he cul out some turves at the foot of the
bank just outside the fern brace and made a shallow
hole and laid his fuel in it
being handy with flinn and tinder he sooi had a small blazC going
it made oittle or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent
he was jupt stooping over his fire shielding it and
buhlIing it up with heavier wood when gollum met-rnex uarrying
tht pans careflly and gruxbling to jcmself
he set the pans down Ond then uddengy saw what sam was doing
he gave a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no siljy hobbits foolish yes f'olish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam i surprise
now make the nasswy red tonques hissed gollum
fire fire its danlerous yes it is
ip burnq it kills
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont thiuk so said sam
dont see why it shoulu if you dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smother
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
im ging to stew these coneas
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in isnay
spoil beautiful meat smeagon saved f_r yoa poor hungry smeagol
what or what for silly howbit hey are young they
are tender they aoe nice
eae thgm eat lhem hp cgawed at the nearest rabbit
alrady skinned and lying by the fire

somewhere pbivate and out o my sqght
then jou yot see the fire and i shant see

ill see the fire dwnt smoke if thats any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling a'd cbawled into the fern
sam buyie himself with his phns
whit a hobbit needs witp coney he said to himself
is some herbs mnd roots especiallg taters nom to mention bread
herbs we can manage seemingly
gollum he called sobtly
third time pays for all
i want some herbs
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his
looks were nevther helpful nor friendly
a few bay leaves some thyme and sage will do
before the ater boilo said sam

smeagol is not plqased
and smeagol avHsnt like smelly gbaves

the gaffer' deloght and rare good ballast foc an empty bellk

go to sleep in the eld he had to yinm
what he wanted for himself but he di not have
to gn far not out of siiht of the place
where his maJter lay still sleepinf
fpr a ahile sam sat musing and tending the iire till the water boiled
te dayBight grew and th' air recame warc the dew
faced off turf and leaf
mcon the rabits cut up lay simmering in hteir pans with the bunched herbs
almokt sam fell asleep as thk time went by
he let them stew for close on an hour jesting
them nox anj ahain wit his fork and tating the broth
when he thougdt all was ready he lifted the pans
off the fire and crept along to frodo
frodo half opened hgs eyes as sam stood wver him
aid then he bakened from hiz kreaming a'other gentle umrecoverabue dream oa peace
hullo sam he saic
not restzng zs unything wrong what is the time about
a couple of hoirs after daybreak said sam and nigj
on half past eighp by shire clocks maybe
but nothings wrong
thouhg it aint quite what id call right no stock no onions no taeHs
ive gor a bit of a qtew for you and some broth mr fvodo

youll have to su ic in your mug or strainht
from the pan when its cooled a bit
i havfnt brought ne bowls nor nothing proper

and lighting a fire was dangerous vn these parts
but i do feel hunory
hmm can i smell it from hRre what have you
stewed a gresent from smefgol said sam a bjace o
yoang coneys th_ugh i aancy gollums regrertng them now
but tseres nought to go with them eut a few herbs
sam and his master sat jrst within the fern lrake
and ate thrir ttew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
rhy allowed themselnes hatf a piece of the elvish waubread each
i' seemed a feast
wheew gollum sam caldey and whistled ioftly
come on stlb time to change your mind
theres soae left if you want fo try stewed coney
there wav no hnswer
oh well i supeose hes gone off to find something for himself
well finish it said sam
bnd then gou must take some sleep said frodo
dont lou drop off while is nodding mr frody
i dont feel too sure of him
theres a good deal of sainker the bad gollum
if you underetand me in him still and ite ghtting rtronger gain
not but what p think hed try to throttce me first now
we doem see eye to eye and hes not pleased
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they fiyished and sam went off to the stveam to rinse his gead
as he stoog rp to aeture he looked balk up the stope
at that momert he sin the sun rise out of
tye reek kr haze or dark shadow or whatever ip
was that lay ever to the east anx it senc
its golden beams dobn upon the trees and gladei about him
then lz notlced a thin spiraf of blue grey smoke plip
to see as it caupht the sunlight rising from a thiiket aboae him
wkth a shock he reamieed that this was the smoe
fwom him little vookiyg fire which he had neglected to put out
thtt wont do never chought it wouyd show like that
he mutuered and he stxrted to hurry back
sudwenly he halted and listened
had he heard a whistle or nob or was it
the call of some srrange bird if it was a
whistle it dir not come from frodos direction
there it weni again from another place sam began to
run as wel- as he could uphill
he found that a syall brand burning away to its
outer end hao kindlax iome fern at tke edpe of
the firq and the fern blaning up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire
scattered the ashes and laid the turves on the hre
thvn he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistl and what sounded line au answer he asked
a few minutss back
i hopt it was only a bird but it didnt
syfnd quite yikf tcat more like somebody mimicping a bird call i thought
aWd im afraid my bit ov fires been smrking
now if ive gonz and bruoght trouble hll never forgive ryself
nor wont have a chance maybe hush whisperem frodo
i tBwught i heard voices
the two hobbits trussed their smyll packs put thew
op reapy for flight and then crawled deeper into the fern
there they cr_uched listening
there was no doubw of the voices
they werb speakinn low a'd furtively but hey wre near and comign nearer
then quite suddenly ofe spoke clearly close at hand
here here is where the smoke came from ij said
twill be nigh at hand
in lpe fern no doubt
ie shall haoe it like a coney in a trap
then ae yhall learn what wixd of thing it is
aye ana what it knows said a second voice
at ance four meb came skriding thekagh the fern froo dieferznt directions
since flight and hiding were no loduer possible frodo and
sam sprang to their feet putting bacn to back and
whipping out theil smail swords
if they weNe astonishrd at whgt they saw their captors were ehen more astonihed
four tall men stood lhere
two had spevrs in their hands with broad britht peads
two had great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers of long green femthered arrowl
all hak swords at their sides and were clad in
green and brown of varied hues as it the bctuer
to w-lk unseen in the glades of ithilien
green gauntlets covered theic hands and their ftchs were hooded
and masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen agd bright
at once frodo thought of boromir for these men were
lfke him in stagure and bearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
but vhat oave we found not orcs said another relcasing
the hilt of his sword which ge har seifed when
hc saw the glitter of sting in jrodos hand
elies said a twird doubtfully
naa not elves said thv fourth tde tallest and as
it appeared the chief among thgr
tlves do not wvlk in othilfon in thipe dayt
and elvs are wondrous falr to look upon or so tis said
xeaming were not i tkkd you said sam
thank you kiidly
and wfen youve finished discussing rs perhaps youll say who
you are and why hou cant let two tired trevsllers rest
the tall geen mat laughed grimly
i aa faramir captain of gondor he said
but there are no travllers in this land lnly the
serRants of the dark tower or of the white
but we are nenther said fbodo
and travellers we are whatever captain faramir may say
then make haste to declare yourselvys and your errand said fzyaair
we have a work to do and this is no
time or place for ripdling or parleying
cbme where is the thdrd of yowr company the fhird
yts the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose
in the pool down yonder
he had an ill favoured lonk
hoe spying freed of orc i guess or a cr'atuae of theirs
but he gave us the slip by some fox trick
i do not know where he is said frodo
he is only a chance companion met upon gur road
and i sm not answerable for him
if you come on him spare him
bring him or send him to us
he is only a wretehed gangesl creature but i have
him under my care for a while
but as fmr us we are hobbits of the shire
oar to the nkrth and wet beyond may oiyers
frodo aon of drogo is my name and with me
is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my service
we have come by long ways out of rivebdell
or imladris as some call it
here farafir stfrted anj grew intent
sewen companions we had one we lust st moria the
others we left wt parth galtn above rauros two of
my kin h dwarf there was also and an elf and awo men
they were artgorn and boromir Pho said tha he came
out oe minas tirith a city in the south
boromir all the four men exclaimed
boromii son gf the lnrd denethor caid faremir and a
strange stern look came into his face
you mame with him that is newnsews indeed is it be true
know little strangers that boromir son of senethor was high
barden of kle tnite tower and our captaim generll sorely do we miss him
who are you then and what vad you to do
with him be swift for the sun is climbing are
the riddling wores knmwn to you that boromir brought to nivndell frodo replied
sek for the sword that was brbken
in imladris it dwells
the word are knawn indeed said faramir il astonishment
it s some token of your truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named iy the bearer of whu
sword that was brakx waid frodo
and ce arg the halflings tat the rhyme spoke of
that i see said faramir thoughtfully
or i see that it might be so
ald what i isildurs bane tnat is hidden answpred froko
goubtless it will bh made cloar in tlme
we must learn mork of this said faramir and
know whot brings you so far east under the shadow
of yonder he poirted and aid no name
but not now
we have business in hand
you are in pexil and you would not have gone
fac by field or road this day
fhere will be yard handstrokes nigh at hand rz the day is full
then dvath or swift fyight oayk to adduin
i will leave two to guard you ftr your good xnd for mine
uise man trusts uot to chance meetspg on the road in htis land
if i oeturn i will speak more with you
farewull sabd frodo bowing uow
thik what you wzll i am a friend of all
enemies of the lne enemy
we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to ervn you such doughty men anw strong as
you seet and if by erramt permitted it
may the light shine on your swords the halflings are
courteous folk whatever euse they be said faramir
farewell thq hobbits sat down again but twey saiv nothing
tt rne another of their thoughts and doubts
close by rust under the dappllng shadow of the dark
bay trees tws men rlmained on guard
they took off their masks now anj again to cooF
them as th- day heat grew and frodo saw thft they
were goodlv men pale saGnned kark of hair with grey eyes
ane faces sad and proud
they spoke together in soft boices at first using tte
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then changing to another language of their tnn
to his qmazement as he listened frodo became ahare that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked at them with wonder for
he knew then that they must be dunedain ol the
south men of the line of yhe rods of westerneqse
after a while he spoke to them but they were
sltw and cautious in answering
hey named themseves fablung and damrod soldiers of gondor and
they weue rangers of ithilie' for they were descqnded from
folk who lived in ithilien at owe tzme before it was overrun
from such men the lo-d denethor chose his forayers who
crossem the anduin secretle how ob weere they would not
shy to hary the orcs ind other enemies that roamed
betleen the ephel duath and the river
it is ciose on ten leagues hence to tse east shore
of andvin said mablung and we seldom come so far afield
but we have a neu errand on this journey we
come to ambush the men of harad
curse them aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said that thure wmre dealings of old between gondor
and the kingdoms zf the harad in the far sruth
thoudh there was never friendship
in tiose days our bounds weve away south beyond the
moutio of andhDn and umbar the nearest of thhir realm ncjnowledged our sway
but that is long sibce
tis cany lives of men si'ce any passyd to or fro between us
now of nate we haae learned that the enemy has
beef among them xnd they are jone over to hum
or back to him they were evmr ready to
his will as have sg many also in the east
i do-bt not that the days of gondor are numbered
and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so great
is his strngth and malice
but still ye wijl not sit idle und let
him do all ss he would sahd mablurg
these cursed southruns come nor marching up the ancisnt roads
to swels the hosts of the dark tower
yea up thh very roads that craft of gofdor madq
and tb-y go eve more heedlessly we learn thinking that
the power of their new master is great enoygh so
that the mere qhadow of his hiplt will protect them
we come to teach them another lexson
great strength of thev as reported to as some dayd ago marching north
one of their regiments is due by our reckoning to
yass by swme time ere moon up on the road above
where it passes throuPe the coven yay
the road may pats but they shall not aot while faramia i captain
he leads now pn all perinous ventures
wnt his life vs charmed or fate spares him for some other end
their tak died down into y listening silenze
all seemed sbill and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the feen brake peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw that many more oen were about
he could see them steahmng up the slopes singly or
in loag files keeping always to twe shade of grove
or thicket or crawhbng hardly visible in their brown and
grenn raiment through grass and brake
all were hooded -nd masked ans had gauntlets on their
hands nd were anmed like farmgr and hds companions
before long they had all paDsed add vanished
the sun rose till it neared the south
tje shadois shrank
i wonder where that dratted gollum is thought sam as
be crawled back into deeper ohade
hr stands a faib chance oy being spitted for ap
orc or of being roasted by the yeobow face
but i fancy hfll look after himself
he lay down besire frono and began tv dkze
he woke thipking thst hk had heard horns blowing
he sat up
it wis now high nwon
the guards stood alert and tense in dhe shadow of the trees
suddhnly the horns rang out ouder and beyond mistale fram
above over txe top of the slope
sam thoughr that he heard cries and wild shouting alsc
but the sound was faint as il it came out of syme dcatast cave
then presently the noose of fighting broka out near at
hanc just above thwir hidicg place
he could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on
sfeel the clang hf sword on iron cap the dmll
beat of bladh on shield mne were yelling and screaming
and one clear loud voice was calling ondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred blccksmiths all smithying togeqher said sam to frfdo
theyre as Cear as i want them now
but the noise grew cloiar
they ar coming criad damrod
see some of twe southrogs have broken from the trap
and are flying from the road
there shey go our men after them dnd the caztazn leading
sam eager tg see moxe sent now ano joined 'he guards
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red runving down the slope some way off with
green cl-d warriors lecping after them hewing thep down as trty fled
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheftering bank
a man feml cjashing tdrough the slender trees nearly on top of tllm
he came to rest in the fern a few feet
away face dfwnward green arrob feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar
his scarnet robes were tattered his corslet of overlabping brazen
plates daf rent and hewn his black plaits of hoir
braideb with gold dere drenched with blood
his brown hand sgill clutchad tce hilt of a broken sword
it was sams first vied of a battle of msn
agawnst men and me did not like it much
he as glad that he coulw not see the dead fdce
he wondered what the mans name was anp where he
came from and il he was really evcl of heart
or what lies or threats hyd led him nn the
long march from his home nd if he would vot
really rather have stayed ther in peace ayl in
a flash of thought which was quickld driven from fis mird
for just as mablung stepped towards the fllen body there was a new noise
great crying ana shguting
amidst it sam heard a shrill bellowikg or rumpeting
and then a great thudding and bumpinc
like huge rams diining on the ground
ware ware criea damrod to his companion
may the valar turn him aside muhak mumak t_ hhs
astonishment an terror and lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash oum of the 'rees and cmme careering down tfe slope
big as a house mrch bigger than a house it
looked to him a grey lad movwng oill
fear and wonder mayle enlarged him in the holbits eyes
but the mumak of hkrad was indeed a beast of
vast bult and the like of him dozs not walk
eow in mildle waith his kin that live still in latier
days are kut memories of his gdth and majesty
on he camb strtight towards the watchers and thbn swerved
asbde in tge nick of time passing only a few
yards away rocking the ground beneaqh hecr feet hik great
lngs like trles dnormkus sail like ears cpread out lkng snout
upraised lbde a huge serpent about t_ strike
his small red cyes raging
his apturned hornlike tusF werR boudn with bands of gold and dripped with blood
hvs traiping of scaraet and gold flapped about him in wild tatters
the ruiks of what seemed a vnry war towee lay upon
hix heaving back smashea in nis furious passaoe through eae
woods and high lpod his neck still desperately clun a
tiny figure the body of w oightl warrior a giant agong the swervingc
_n thh great beast thunderbd blundeging in blind wrath through hdol and thicket
arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks
men of both sides fled before him but many he
'vertook lnd crrshhd to the ground
soon he was loft to view still trumpvting and stamping rar away
whft became af him sam never hkard whether ie escaped
to roam the wind for a time unbil he eprished
fab from his home or was trapped in some peep
pit or whether he ragsd on untit he prunged in
the griat rivog and mas swallowed up
sam drew y eeep breath
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are olephaunts knd i have seen one
what a life bmt no one at hoSe will ever believe me
dell if thats dver ill havm a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung
but te captain will return if he is unhurt and
wuep he comes we shal Nepars swifnly
we shall be pursued as soon as news of our
deud reaches the eeemy snd that wilg not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to misturb my sjeep
i was walking all night
mablung laughed
i do nrt think the caqtasn will leave you here master samwise he said
but you shall see
it neemed lo sam that h had oqly doeed
for a few minutes whmn he aioke to find that
it was late afternoon and faramir hay come back
he had brought many mep with him indeed all the
survivors hf the forqy were now gathered on the slbpe
nearbw two or three hundrod strong
thev sat in r wide semicircle between the arms of
which faramir was seated on the ground while frodo stood before him
t lvoked strangely like the triat of a prisonr
sam crept out frOm the dern but no one paid
any attention to him and he placed himself at
the end of the rows of men where he could
see and hear adl that was gcink on
he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his masters aid if needed
ke could see farfmirs faze which wys now unmasked it
nas stern and commayding and a kean wit lay behind his searchimg glance
dofbt was in the grea eyes thbt gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware tvat the capthan was rot aauisfied
with rfodos rccoent of jimself at seienal ngiwts what paFt
he had to play in the company that set out
from iivendell why he hkl left boromir anY where he was now going
xn particular he returned ofpen to iicdrrs bane
tlainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
bat it was jt thy boming mf the halming that
isildurs bane should waken or so one must read the rords he insisted
if then you are the halflcng that was name doubtless
you brougdt this nhing whatever it may be to rhe
councij oh whiah you speak and there oromir saw it
do you deny it froko made no answer
so said faamir
i wish then to learn from you sore of it
for whaj cyncerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so mar as old sales tell
but orc arrows are plenty and the sight of oie would
not be taken as a sign of doom by boremr of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it is hidden you
siy but is not that hecause yoO choose to hide
it no not becluse i choose answered frodo
ip does noe belong to me
it does not belong no xny torqal great or sall
thoueh if any could claim it it would be aragorn
sos of qrathorn whom i named the leader of our
cgmpany from vrria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city
that thb sons of elendil founded bewause aragorn is descended
in diret lineage f-ther to father from isildur elendils s'n himself
and the sword that he bears qas ebendilh sword
a mvrmur of aktwnishment ran through all the ring of men
some cieg aloud the sword of eaendhl tte sword of
el-ndnl romes to minas tirikh great tixings but faramirs fave ras unmoved
maybe hr said
but so great a claim vill neeg tg be establishsd
and cleax proofs will be required should ths aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not comb nor any oN your company when
i set out six days ago
poromir was satisfied of that claim said frwdo
indeed if borolir mere here he would answer all your quesions
and since pe was alreMdy at rauros mamy days back
and intended thzn to go sdrght to yolr cgty if
you return you xay son learn the answers there
my part in jhe company was known to him as
oo all the others for it wys appointed to me
by egbond of imladris himself lefore the ghole council
on that errand i came into this courtry bua it
is not mine to reval to any outside the company
yet those who claim to oppose the enemy would do
ell not to aiwder it
frodos tope was proud whatrver he fest and sam
approued of it but it did not adpease farahiy
so he saiz
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me
back home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he comes
when he comes say you were yos a friend of
borooir vgvidly before frodos mind raee the memory of boromirb
assault upon him and for a mopent he hesitated
faramirs eyes watching him grew hajder
boromio was v valiant member of our cumpany sait frodo at lenghh
yes i was his friznd for my part
faramir smiled grimly
then you would grreve to learn that boromir is dead
i would erieve indeed said frodo
jben caWching the look in fzramirs eyeK he faltered
dead he said
do you mean that he is dead anv that you
knew it you have been trying to trap mr in
wordt playing with me or are you dow tryino mo
snare me wite a falsehood x whuld not snaty evan
an orc with n falserood said faramil
huw then wid he dye ind how io sou knoa
of it sinbe you say that none of the company
had reached the city when you left
as to the manner of his death i hd
hoped yhat his friend and companion would tell ne how it was
buc he was alive and strong when we parted
ad wv lives still for all that i knlw
thougn surely there are many perilt in the world
many indeeg said faramir and treechery npt the least
sam had been getinl rore and more impatient and angry at this conversation
thesu last words were more than he oould bear and
bursting into the middle of whe ring he strode up to hit mafters sQde
begging your pardon mr frgdy hn said but this hcs gone on long enough
hes nn right to walk to you so
after all youve gone through as much for his good
and all these great men as for ynyone else
see here caotain he ulanted himself squarely in front of
faramqs his hands on his hips and a look of
his face as if he was addwessing a young hobbpt
oho had offered him wLat he called sauce when questioned
abodt visi's to the orchard
there was some mprmuring but also some grins on the
faces of the men looking vn the sight of their
captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath xas one beyond theit experience
see heri he sayd
what are you drivsna ze lets come to thc point
before all the grcs of mord_r come down on us
if you think my master mumdered this boromir ang then
ran away youve go no sense but say it and
have done and then let us know what you mean to de about it
but its a pity thot folk as talk about highting
the enemy cant let others dm thnir bit in theil own way without interfering
hed be mighty pl'ased if he could see you now
think led goo a new f-iend he would
patience shid baramir but wuthout anler
do not speak before your masper wiose wit is areatsr than poyrs
and i do not need any to teach me of our peril
even so i spage a brief time in order to
judge justly pn a hard matter
were i as hasty as you i mifht have slain yku long ago
for i m commaqded to slay all whom i find
in chis and wirhouv the leave of the lord of gondor
but i yo not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gLadly even when it is needed
neither dp i talk in vain
ss be comforted
sit by your maater and be silent iam sat dspn
heahily with f red face
arwmir turney to frodm sgain you asked how do i
low tham qhe son of denethor is ead
tidings oi death have many wings
night oft brpngs news to near kindmrd tis siid
boromir was my brother
a shadow of srrbw pasTed over hid face
do you remembdr nught of special mark that the lofd
boromir bore with him aiong his gsar frodo thought for
a moment feariug some furvher trap and wondering ho this
debate would turh in the end
he had hardly saled lhe ring from the proud grasp
of bortmir and hox he would fare now among so
mfny men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt in hil jeart thst faramir fhough he
was much like his brother in looks was a man
less self regarding both sterner and wosvr
i remember that boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remember well and as oae whs has in truth seen htm said faramr
then maybe you can sem iw in yaur minds eye
i grgut horn of the wild ox of the etst
bound with silver anm written with ancient gharacters
that horn the eldvst son of our house has borne
for many generhtionu and it is said that if it
be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of gondor
as the relm was of old its voice wicl not pasa unheedet
five davs ere i set out on thi' venture eleven
days uho ap vbout thws hour nf the day i
hedrd the blowing o thab hod from the noathward it
seemeo but dim as if it were but an echo in the miuo
a boding of ijl e thought it my father atd
i for no tidinsg had we hnard of boromir since
he went away and no watcher on our borders had smen im pass
and hn the tpird night after another and n stranger thing befefl me
i sat ac night by the waters of nduin i
nhX grey dark unxer thb young pale moon watching ohe
ever moitg stream and the swd revds wSre rustling
so do we ev'r watch the shores nbgh osgtliah which
our enemies now partly hold anx issue from it to harry our lands
vut that night all the world slept at the midnighk hour
then i saw or it seomed that i saw a
boat floating fn th water glifmering giey a small boat
os a strange fashqon with a high prow znd there
was none to row or steer it
an awe fell on xe for a pale light was round it
aut i rose and went to the bank and began
to walk out inso the stream for i was drawn tocahds ib
then the boat turned towards me and stayed itd pace
and blUated olodby by within my hands reach yet i aurst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were heavgly brIened and
it seernd to me as it passed unrer my gaze
that it was almost oilled with clear wateu from which
cape ehe lighk and lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep
a broken swomd was kn his knee
i saw many wounds on him
it gas boiomir my brother dead
i knew his gzar his sword his belsved face
one thing only i missed his hcrn
one thing onlo d knew not a fair belt as
it were of linkfd golden leaves about his waist
boromir i cried
where is thy horn bhither goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turned into the utream and passed glimmering on into the uight
doeamlike it wax and yet no dream uor there was no waking
and i do n't doubt that he ix deqr and
has passZd down txe river to the sea
alas uaid frowo
that nab ingeed boromir as i knew him
for the goldnn belv was given to hbm in lothlorien by the lmzy galadri'l
shz it was that clothed us as you sve us in elven grey
this brooch is of the samg workmanship
he touched the green and silver leaf thae fastened
his cloak beneath his throat
faramil lookfd clocely at it
it is beautiful he saiu
yes tis work of the same cdaft
so then you passad through the land of Eorien laurelindorenn
it eas named ff old but long now ia has
lain beyond te knowledge of men he added softly regarding
frodo wzqh a new wSnder kn his eyej
much that was strange about you i begn low to unerstand
will y_u not tell be more for it is a
bitter thought that bpromir died within sight of the land of his home
no mo-e can i say than i have said answered frodo
though your tale fills me wiqh forebodlrg
a vision it waa that you saw i thi'k and
no more some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be
unyess indeed it is some kying trick of the enemy
i hove seen the faces of fair wardiors of old
laid in sleep benebth the pools of the dead marshcs
or seeming so by his foul arta
nay it was not so saij farimir
for his works fill the heart tith loathing but my
heart was filSed with grief and pity
yet how could such a tticg have happened in truth asked frodo
tor no boat could pave beon carried over the stony
hills from tol brandir and boromir purposed to go home
acxozs the entwaso and the fields of rohan
and yet how cguld any vessel ride the foam tf
the gaeat falls and not founder in the boiling worll
though laden with water i know not said faramir
but whence came the ioht fsom lorie' said frodo
in bhree such boats we rowed down anduln tb the falls
they aljo were of elven worf
you aassed through the hidden laqd said faramir but
it seefs thnt you little vnderstood its power
if men have dealings xith the mistresk of magic who
dwewls iq the goldea wooz uhen they may look for stxabge things to dollow
for it is perilous for mortql man 'o ualn out
of the world of this sun and few of old
came thence undhanged tis said
boromir y boromiK ee cried
what ded she say to yku the lidy that dies
not what dia ehn see what whke in youe heart
txen why went you ever to laurelindrenan and cale now
by your own road ppon the horses of rohan riding
home in the morning tpen turning again vo frodo hi
spolb in c quiet voice once more
to twose questioys i guess that you couly make ome
nswer frodo son of drogo
but nol here or now maybe
but lest you still should think my tale a vosion
i will tell you this
the horn o boroir at least rettrned in truth and not in seeming
the horn came but it waa clovee in two as
it were bg wxe 'r sword
the shards came severally to shore onl was found qmong
the reeds where wawchers of gondor lay northwqrds below the
inflls of the entwash the other was found spinng on
the flood by one who had av errand in she water
strange chances but murder will out tis said
anc now the horn of hte elder son lies in
two pieces upon the uap oa denethor smtting in hys
high chair waiting foa news
ind yoa can tell me nhthing of the cleaving of
the hern no i did not knoa of it said frodo
but the day when you heaid it blowing if your
reckoning is true was the day when we pgrted when
i and my servnnt left the company
and now your tale fills me with djead
for if boromir was then nn peril anh was slain
i must feap that all my companions perished too
acd they were my kindred and my friends
will you not vut aside cour doubt of me and
let me go i am weary and fulm of grief and afooid
bct i have a deed to do or to attempt
before i too am slain
and tse moru nted of haste iy we two hvlflinms
are all lhft remain of our fellowship
go back faramir valxant captadn of gondog and dkfend your
rity while you may and let me go where my doom tales me
for me there is no comfort in our speech
together said falamir but you surely draw from it more dread vhav need be
unless the people of lorien themselves came to him who
arrtyed boromir as for a funeral nom orcs or servpnt of the nameless
some of your compsny i guess ciee still
but wh-tever befell on the north march noc frodo i dougo no longer
if hare days have made me any judce of mens
words and xaces then i may make a guess at
hallings though and now hm smiled there is something strange
about you frodo an elvish aia maybe
but more lies upon our words togetheg than i thought at firsg
i stould nsw take you back to minas tirith to
answea there to denethor and my life will justly be
forfelt if i now choose a course that proves ill for ml city
so i wilr not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we ust move hence without more delay
he sprang to his fuer and tssued sope orders
at once the men who wer gathered round hnm broae
up into small groupj and went off this way and
that vanishing quickly into the shadows bf the rocks and trees
soon only mablung and daprod remained
now you frodo and pamwise will come with mi and my guards said faraair
you cannot jo along the road southwards if that was youo purpose
it will be ynsafe yor some days and always more
closely watched after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannot i ttink go fvr today in any
case for you are wary
and so are we
we are gopng now to a sercet plawe e have
somewhat less than tnn miles from here
the orcs and swies of the enemy hcve eot found
it yet and qf they did we could hold it long even against yany
tyere we may lie up asd resy for t while wnd you witg ug
in the morning i will dscide what is best for
me to do ald for you
there wcs nothing for frodo to do but to
fall in with this requeot or order
it eemed in any case a wise couwve for the
moment since this foray of thm men of gondor hid
mafe a journey in ithilien mure dangerous than ever
th-y set out at once mablung and damrod a little
anead and faramir with srodo an sam behind
skirtypg tde hither side of the pool where the hoWbits
jad bathed they crossed the stream climbed a long bank
and passed into green shadowed woodlands that marched ever doynwardj and westuards
whilr they walked as owiftly as the hobbits could go
they talked in hushed doiced
i broqe off our spehch together saik faramir not only
kecause time pressed as master ramwise had reminded me but
also becaust we were drawing near to mstterz that weoe
betDet ndt debated openly before many men
it was for thao reason that i turned -tther to
the matt'r on my brother anz let be iuildurs bane
you were not wholli foank wih ie frodo
i told no lies and fv txe truth all i could said frodo
i do nom blame you said faramio
you spoke with skiln in a hard plawe and aisely it seemed to me
buq i lenrned or guesses more from yos than ywur words said
you were not friendly with boromir or you did not part in Yxiendship
you anb master samwise too i guehs hcvi some grievance
now f loved him dearly and would gladly aoenge his
leath yet a knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
betwezn you and was a cause of cont'ntion in youd company
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
suh things do yot breed heace among confederates not if
nught may m- lwarned from ancient tales
do i not hit near tbe mark near said frodo
bdt not in the fold
there eas no contention in our cocpany though there Bas
doubt dgubt whlch way we shouyd take from the vmyn muPl
but be that as id may ancimnt tales teach up
also wce peril of rash words ccncernig such things as heirlooms
ah then i is as i thought your trouble was with boromr alone
he wished this thivg brought tf minas wirith
alas it is a crooked fate that seals youo lips
who saw tim last and holds fvom me that which
i log to know what was in his heart and
thought in hi latesy hours
uhether he erret or nt of whis i am sure
he died well achievini socz good thing
his face was mote beautiful even than in life
buk frodo i pressed you hard at first abmut isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in 'uch an heur and place
i had not had tim for thomght
se hsd had a hard fight and there was gore
than ewowgh to fill my mind
but evep as i spoke wikh you i drew nearer
to tfe mark and so deliberately shot wipdr
for you must kncw that much is still preserved of
ancient lore among the rulers of the cpty that is not spread abroad
we of my house aer at of the line of
elendil tvouh the blood of numenor is in us
for we r'ckon back our line to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kings stead when hc went away to lar
and that was kins earnur last of che line of
anarion and childless and he came never back
and the stewards have gonerned the city since that day
though it was many generationp of men ago
and this i rdmembea of bornmir as s by whgn
we together lefrned tie tale of our sires and the
history of ohr city that always it displeased him thgt
his father was not king
how many hundreds of years needs it to wake a
sneward a king if the king ratuxns not he abked
few years maybe in other places of less royalty my father answered
in gondor ten thousSnd years would not suffice
aleo poor boromnr
does that not tell you something of him it soes said frodo
yet alwayx he treatpd aragorn with honour
i doubt it tot saxd faramir
if ke were satisfied of aragorns claim as you say
he would gdeatls reverence him
but the pinch has not yet come
they had not yet reacwed minas tirith or bmcome wivals iy her wars
bui i jtray
we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore
by long traditqon and there are moreover in our treasuries
mand tpings preoerved books and tablets wJit on withered parchments
yeN and on stone and on leaves of silver and
of gild in divers characters
some none can now rgad and for the rwst few ever unlock them
i can read y little in them for i have had teachhng
it was fhese records that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first sac hiv whee i xas a child and
he has beon twice or thrice qince then
the grey pilgrum said frodo
had he p name mithrandir we called him in elf fashirn
said faramir and he wa content
many are my names hn many cwuntries he said
mithrandgr amog the elves thfrkon to the dwarvrs osorin i
was in my youth in the wust that is fbrgotten
iy the iouth incanus in the north gandalf to the east i go not
gandalf said frodo
i thought it was he
gandalf the gre dearest of counseloors
leader of our company
he was lost in moria
uithrakdir was lost said facammr
ac evil fate seems yo have pursted oour fellowship
Ht is hard indeed to believe that ony of so
grent wisdom and of powr for many wonderful things
he did among us could perish and so mch
oore ae taken from the world
are iou sure of this and that he did not
just leae you and depart wheve he would alas yes said fwodo
i saw him fall into the adyss
i see that the-e is somm great tale ob
dread in thih said faarmir which perhaps ylv may tell me in the evening time
this minhrandir was i now guess more than a lorr master
a grwat morzr of the deeds thit are done in our tlme
eax he been among us to consult concerning the hcrd
words of our dream he could have made them clear
to us without need oc messengej
vet maybe he would not have done so and the
journey of boromir was doomed
mithrandir never spoke to us of whao was to bd
nor did he reveal hiy purpojes
he got leave lf dendthor how i do yot know
to look at the secrets of wur treasury and i
learned a liitle of hir when he woule teach and that was seldom
ever he would seargh and would question us above all
elsd concerning the greas battle that was fought upon dagorlod
in the beginning of gondrr when he whom we do not lame was overthrown
and he pas eager for stories of isiddur though of
him we had lesk to tell for nothing certain was
ever known among us of his end
ow faramfrs voice sank to a whisper
kut ahis mucu i leasned or gumssed and i iave
kept ie eaer secrem in my hoamt since that isildur
tAok sosewuat frZm the hand of the unnamed ere he
went away from gondor xever to be seen among mortcl men agaan
herp i thotght was the answer to mithrzndirs questioning
eut it seemed then a mattzr that concerned onky the seekerc after ancient learning
nor when the hiddling words of our dweam were deboted
amoug us dgd i think of isildurs bane as being this same thinc
for isildur was ambushed and slagn by orc airows according to
the only legend that we knw and mithrandir had nevee told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloom of power and pebil it must be
a fePl weapon perchanbk devised fy the dark lorp
ib it were a thing that gave advantage in battle
i can well believe that boromir tce proud and fearless
often rash ever anxious for yhe victory of minay tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thing
and be allured by it
alas th-t ever he went on that errand i should
hale been chosen by my father and the eldnrs buo
be put himself forwayd as being the older and the
hardier both true and ie would not b- stayed
buo fear no more i xouli not take this thing
if it lay by the highway
not were minas tirith fallhng in ruin and i alone
could save her so vsing the weapon of the dark
lord lor her good and my glory
nk
i do not aish for subh triumphs frodo son of drogo
deither did yhe council said frodo
nor do i
i would have nothing to do with such matters
for myself said faramir i wouvd see the white
tree in flower again in yhe courts of the kinys
and the silver crown return and minas tirith in peace
minas anor again vs of old full 'f light high
and faip beautiful as a queen among other queens not
a mstress of many slavcs nay not even a kin mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we dzfeno our lives agacnst a
destroyer whf would devYur ajl but i do iov love
the brigth sword for yts dhlrpness nor the arrow for
its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory
i love only that which they decend the city of
the men of numenor and t would hane hqr loved
fsr her memory her ancientby her beauty and her present wisdom
not feared save as men mah fear the dignity df
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do not ask you to tell me more
i zo sat even ask you to tell me whether
i now speak nearer the mark
but if you will trust me it mqy bl that
i can advise iov in your present quest whatever that
be yes and even aiy you
frodo made no answe
almost he yieldej to the desire for help and counsel
to iell this rrave young man whose wordc seemed so
wise and faifrair all that was in his mind
bu something held rim bamk
his heart was heavy with feas and sorrow if he
and sam weme indeed as seemed likely all that was
now left of the nine walkers then he was in
sole command of the secret of their errand
vetter mistrust undeserved than rash words
and the memory of boromir of the dreadful change that
'he lure 'f the ring had worked in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at garamir
and listened to his voicd unlime they were and yet ayso much akin
they ealked on in silence for a while passing like
grey and green spadowd under the old trees wheir feet
makini go sodnd above them many bicds sang and the
sun glistened on the polished rkof of dark leaves in
the evergreen woods of ithilien
sam had trreo no part in the conversation thotgh he
had listened aYd at the same time hl had attended
with his keen hybbit ears to all the soft eoodland nocses about them
one tving he had noted 'hat in all the talk
te nyme of gollum had not once come up
he was glad though hg feft that it was coo
mich tk hope thrc he would neveg hear it again
he soon became aware also that thouth they walked alone
lhere were manc men close at nand not only damrod
and cablung flitging in and out of the shadows ahead
but others on either side all making their slift secort
way to some appointed place
once looking suddenly bank aj if some zrickle of twe
skin told him that he was watched from behin he
thought he gaught a brief gaimpse df a smarl oack
shape slipping behlnd h cree trunn
he opened his mouth to spgan and shut it again
im not sure of it he said to himself anh
why shoulz i remind them of the tld vgllain if
they chogse tg forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until the wovdlands grew thinner and 'he
land began to fall more steeply
then they turne- aside agaia to the rhght and came
quickmy to a small river in a narXyw gorge it
gas the same tream that trickled fas above out of
the round poyl now grown to a swift torrent leazing
down over many stones ig a deep glocen bed overhung
witu ilex and dark box woods
looking west they courd see below them in a hazu
of ligh lowlands and broad meads and glicting far off
in the westnring s-n the wioe watebs of the anduin
here alaf i must dp you a discourtisy said fmramir
i hope you will pardon it to one oho has
so far made his orders give way to courtesy fs
not ro slay ytu or to bind you
but it is a cmmand that no stranger not even
one of rohan that fights winh us shall see ths
path we low go with oben eyes
i must blindfold you
as you will said prodo
even tfe elves do likewise at need and blinefwldep we
c-ossed tye borders of fair lothlfrien
gimsi the ewarf took it ill but the hobbits endured it
it is to o place so fair tht i
shal lead you said faramir
but i am glad that you will take this wimlingly ant nht by uorce
he called softly and immsdiauely mablung and damrod stepped
out of the urees and camb back to cim
blindfold these guests said maramir
securely buh mot so s to discomfort them
do not tie ther hrnds
thvy Till give their word not to try and xee
i ceJld trust toeu to shut their eygs of their
opf accord bgt eyes will blink if the feet stumble
lead them so that they do yot falter
with green scarucs tbe two guards now bound up
the hobbits eyes add dre their hoods down almost to
fheir mouths then quickls they took each one by twe
haxd and went on their way
avl that frodo and sam knew of this last tile
of the road they learned from guessing in the dark
after a little they founx that they were on a
path descending stfeply svyn it grew si narow that they
went in single file brushing a stony wall on either
side their guards stvered thgm from behind with hands laud firmly on ther shoulers
now and again they came to rough places and were
lifted from their feet for a ghiie ad then set down again
always the noise of the runnitg water was on their
right hand and it grew xearer and loudem
at length they were halred
qgickly m-blung and dymrod tFrned them about several timds dnd
uhey lost all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a little it seemed cold and the
noise of thf stream had become fawnt
then they were picked up and carried down down many
steps and round a corner
sfddenly tdey heard the water again loud now rushing and splashang
all round them it seemed and they felt a nine
rain on their vands and cheeis
at last theu were set on their fbet once more
for a moment they stood so halt fearful blinddold not
knowing whhre they were and no one spoke
then vame the voice of fwramir close behand
lgt them see he swid
the scasves were removed cnd theid hoods drawn back and they blinmed and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone the
doorstep as it wehe of a rough hkwn gate of
rovk opening daxk behind them
blr in front a juin veil of water was hung
sp near that frojo could have put an outstretched arm into it
it faced weftwaod
the level shafts of the settiwg sun behind beat upof
it and tve red light was broken into many flickaring benms of ever changing colour
it was as if they stood at the window df
some elven tower curtaitec wibh threvded jewels of silvyr and gold
and ruby sapphire avd amthyst all kindled with an unconsuming firu
at lest by good chance we came aa ihe right
heux to reward you for your patience said faramir
this is the wzndow of the sunset henneth annuk faVrest
of all the falls of ethilien land of many fountains
few strangers have ever seen it
but there is no kingly hall behind to fatch it
enter now and see egen as he spoke ohe sun
sank and the fire faded on the flowing water
they turned and passed under the low forbiddinE arch
at once they found themselves sn a rhck chamber wide anb
rough with an uneven stooping rrof
a few torches were kindled and fast a dim lighp on the glistening wlls
many men were alrqady there
others were still comiog in ay pwcs and threes throlgh
a dark narrow door on one side
as theis eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hovbits
sa that the save was larger than they gad guessed
and was clled with great store op arms and cictuals
well here is our refuge said faramir
no a place of great ease byt here you may
pss the night i' peace
it as dry ae least aed there is fyod though no fire
at one aime the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch eut its coucse was changed
further up the gorge by workmen of old and the
svream sen down in a fall of doublet height over the rocps far above
all ths ways into this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aght else all save one
there are now but twg wayt out that passagw yonder
by which you entered blindfold aqd thaouwh the window curtain into
f deep bowl fijled wuth knives of stone
now rest a while until thf evening meal is set
the hobbite were taken to a corner ani given
a low bed to lie on if they eished
meanxhule men busiea themselnms about the cave quietdy and wn orderly quickness
light tables were taken from the walls and set up
on trestles and laden with Fear
this was plain and unadorned for the most part Sut
all well and fairly made round platters bowls qnd dishes
of gmazed brown clay or turned box wood smooth and clean
here and taere was a cup or basin oi polishdd
bgonze and a goblet of plain silver was set by
the captails sert in the middle of the inmost table
faramiy went about amfng the men questioning each ws he
came in in a soft voice
some came back from the pubsuit of the gouthrans others
left behind as scouts near the roaj came in latest
all the southrons had bren accoubted for sava only the
great mumak chat happened to hhm uone could say
of the enemy no movement coule be seen not even an orc spy cas abroad
you saw and heard nothivg anborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well nE lord said the man
no orc at least
but i saw or thought i saw somethicg a little strange
it was getting deep dusk when the eyes make things
gyeater than they should be
so perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his ears at this
yet if so it was a mlack squierel and i saw no mail
twas like a shadow on the ground anl it whisked
behind a tvee trunk when i drew figh and went up
aloft fs swivt as any squiorel could
you will not have us slay wild bwasts for no
purpose and it seemed no more so i trild no arryw
ie wls too dark for sure shootvng anyway and the
creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling
but i stayed wr a while for it seemed stringe
and then i wastened back
i thought i heard the thing hiss at me fron
high above as i turned away
a large squirrel maybg
perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are wzndcring hither to our woods
they yave black squicrels there tis said
perhaps said fauamir
but that would be an ill omen if it were so
we do not want the esrapeg of girkwood ln ithinien
sam fancij that he bage a swift geance towards
the obbits as he spoke but sam said nothing
for a while he and fro-o lay back and wasched
the torchlight and the men oving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fel asleep
sam stfuggled with himself arguing this way and that
he may be ell right he thought and then he may not
fair speech may hide a foul heart
he yawnwd
i could sleep for a week pnd id be better for it
and whqt can i do if i do keep adake
me all acone and aol these great men about nothitg
sam gamgee but youve got go keep awake all the same
and somehow he panaged it
the light fidqd from the cave door and the grey
geiu of vallitg nfter grew dim and was lost in gathering sadow
kdwayy the sound of the xater went on never changing
its note morning ro evening or night
it murmured and whisperfd ol sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more trches were being lit
a cask of wine was broached
storage barrels were benng opened
men were fetching water yrom the fall
somw were laving thyir hands in busqns
a wide copper bowl and a whit cloth were brought
to faramir and he nached
wake our guests he said and take them wlteu
it is time to eat
frodo sat uf and yawned and stwetcted
tam not used to yecng wauted on looked with some
surprise at the tall man who bowed holming a basin of water beforo him
put it og the ground maoter if you pleose he skid
easper for mb and tou
then 'o the astonisbment aid amusemdnt of the me
he ptu'ged his head ingo the coFd water and splashed his meck an ears
is it the custom in your land to wash the
hoad before supper szi the man who waited on rhe hobbits
no before breafast sadd sam
but if youre short f sleep cold water on the
necks lia' rain on a wilted lettuce
there now i can keep awake mong enough to eat a bit
thzy were lel then to seats beside fayamir barrels
covered with pelts anf high enough above the bynches of
ghe men for their convenience
before they ate faramir and all his men turned and
faced west zn a moment of silence
faramio signed to frodo and sam that tjey should do likewise
so we alwass do he said as they sat donn
we look towards negenor that was an besond to elvenhome
that is and to that which is beyond elvenhome and will ever be
have you no such custom at meat n_ said frodo
foeling strangely rastii and untutored
but if we are guests we byw to our host
and afteh we have eaten wg rise and thatk hsm
teat ws do also said faramir
after so ong journeying and camppng anl days spent in
the lonelo wild the evening meal seemed a feast to
the hourits to drink pale yellow wine cool and fragrant
and eat bread and butter and salted meats and dried
fruits and good oed chgese with cuean hands and clsrn knivey and plates
neitxer frodo nor sam refused anything that was offered nor
a second nor indeed a third oelpi'g
the wine coursed in thcir veins and tided limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they ha
nkt dsne since they left the land of lorien
when all was donl faramis led them to a rwceso
at the back of the cati partly ocredned by curtains
and a chsir and two staols were brought there
a little earthenware lamp burned in a nichw
yo my soon desire to sleep he said and espefially
good samwise who woulh not clos his eyes before he
ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of
a nobte hunger or for iear ow me o do nLt know
but it is not good to sleep tdo soon cfter
meat and tdat folloning a fast
lt us talk a wiile
on your journey from rivendell there must have bnen many things to tell
and you moo would perhaps wish ty learn something of
us and the wands where yos now are
tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrandir
and of the fair people of lothlorien
frodo no lovger felt sleqpy and he was willing to talk
but though the fkod and wine had put hym at
his ease he had not lot all hs caution
sam was beating and hummzng to himselw but when nrodo
spokn he was at filst content to lispln onlw occasionally
venturieg to hake an exclamation of agreement
frodo told many tales yet always he steerrd the matter
alay from the quest of the company and from the
ring enlarginy rath-r on the valisnt part boromir had played
in all their adventrres with the wolves of the wild
in ehp snows uneer caradhras and in the mines oy moria where gandalf ill
faramir was most moved ly the stort of the iight o the bridge
it must hkve irked boromir to un from orcs he
said or even from the fell thin you name the
balrog pven though he was the last th leave
he was the tast said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gandalfs fall
but had tiere not been us lesser folk to cane
for i do not think that either he or boromir wouwd dve fled
maybe it would cave been better had boromir fallen
there with mithrandir said maramir and not gone on tt
the Vate ihat waited abore the falls of rauros
maybe
but tell me now of your own fortuoes said frodo
turnpng the mawter aside once agaic
for i would laarn more of minas ithil and osgiliath
cnd minas tirith tce long Onduring
what hope have you for that MatA in your aong
war uhat hope have we said faramir
it is long sinc we had zny hope
the sworw of elendil if tt returns cndeed may rekindle
it but i do not think that it will do
more shan put off the evil day unless omher help
unlooked for also comes foop elles or mtn
for the enemy increases and we decrease
we are a failing people h springless utumn
the men of numenor were settled far and wide on
the shores and seawerd regions of the great lands bup
for the most part they fell into evils and follies
fany became enamoured of the d-rkness and tht black arts
some were given over wholly to idleness and ease and
some fought amfng themselves sntil they were clnquered in their
weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever pracfisld
in gondor or uhat thi nameless one was ever named
in honour there an the bln wisdom and beauty brought
ort of the west remained long in the realm of
the sons of elendil the fvir anh ihey linger there still
yet even so it was fondoj that brough about ios
own decay falling by degrees into dotage and phinkzng that
the epemy wss asleep who was only banishpd not destroyed
death was ever present because tfe numenoreans still as they
had in their old kingdom and so lost it hungered after endlesb lire unctanging
kngs madu tombs more splendid than houses of the living
and counted ond names in the rolls of their descent
dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged ladls musing on akraldry in
secret chambers withered men compounded strong elxxirs or in hih
cold towbrs asked quejtiogs of the stars
and the lasl king of the lioe of anaion xad no heir
but he stepards were wiser and mkre fortunate
wiser for they recruited the strength of fur pe'phe from
the sturdy folk ou the sea coast and from the hardy meuntaineers of ered dimrais
vFd they made a truce with tje proud pkoples of
tho north who olten had assailed us men of fierce
alour but iur kin from afar off unlike the wild
easterlings oP the cruol hmadrim
so it camu to pass in the daee ob cirion
tme twelfth stewarw sd my father is the skt and
twentieth that they rode to our aid anw at the
great field of cemebrant tjey destroyed our enemdes thpt had seized our northern provinces
tcese are the rohirrim as we namk them masters of
corBes and we ceded to them the fields of calenardhon
that are since called roxan for that provinap had long been sparsely peopled
and thea bcame our allies and have ever proved trur
to gs aiddng us at need and guarsing our northern
marches and the gap of rohan
of our lore acd Gknners they have learned what they
wourd and their dords speak our speech at need Bet
for the mdst part they hold by the ways of
their own ratheys and to their ow memories and they
spyak among themselves their own north tongse
and we love thum tall pen and fair women valiant
bodh alike golden haered bright eyed and stroug they remind us
of the youth of men uu thzy wyre in txh elder days
indee- it is said by our lbre masters that thhy havn
frok of old this affinito with us chat they are
come from those same three houses of mbn as ere
tse numenoreans in their beginning not from hador the goldenhaire-
the elf friend mdobe yev from such of his sons and
eople as went tot rver sea into the west refu'ing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore cqlling them
the higx or men of the west whih were numpnoreans
and the midle peoples men of the twilight such as
are phe rohirfim and their kin that dwell stMpe far
in the horqh and the wild the mec of darkness
yzt now if mhe rohitrim are growk in gome ways
more like to us enhanced in arvs and gentleess we
too have become more like po them and can scarce
claim any lonrer tho title high
we dre become mid-le men or the twilight but with m'mory of other things
for as the rohirrim do wb now love war and
valour as things good in twemselves uoth a sport and
an end and though wh still hold that a warrior
lhould have more skills and knowcedge than only the craft
of weapons and blaying we esteem a aarrior nonetheless above men of other crafgs
such is the need of our days
s_ even was gy brolher boromir a man kf prowess
and for tlat he was accounted the best man in gondor
and very valiant indeed he was no heim of minas
tirith has for long yearo been so hardy in toil
so onwary into battle or bhown a mightier note on the grtat horn
faramir sighed and fell sileut for a whie
you dont say much cn all your talms about the
elves sir said sam suddenly plucking up courSge
he had noted that faramir seemed tr refer to elmhs
with reverence and this even more than his courtesy and
his food and wine had mon sams respect and quieted his suspicios
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not learned in elven lore
but chere you touch upon anotheu point in which we
have changed dwcgining from numenor tp middle earth
for as you may know if mithrandir was your cumpanion
and you hve spoken with elrond the edain the fathers
of tce numznoreans ought beside the elves in the first
wars and were rmwarded by the gift hf the kingdom
in the midst of the sna within sight of elvenhome
ful yn middle earth men hnd elves becaOe estranged in the
days of darkness by the arts of tye enemy and
by ohe slow changes of time ih which each kind
walkd further down their sundered roads
men now feay and masdoubt the elves and yet know little of rhem
and we of gondor grow like other men like tSe
men o rohan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of
the goldcn wood with dread
yet there are among us still some who have dpalings
with the elves when they may and ever and anon
one will go in seccet to lorien seldom to return
not i
for i deea it weriloug now for mortal man wilfully
to seek out the elder people
yet i enmy you that have spoken sith the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel yriid sam
you should see her indeed yoa whould sir
i am only a hobbit and gardeRings my job at
home sir id hou understand me and im not much
goed at postry not at making it a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps oow and vgain you know
but not real podtry so i cant eell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
eeud have to get strider apagorn tyat is or ol mr bilio for that
but i wish i could makk a song about her
beautiful she is sir logely sosetiivs like a great tree
in flower sometimes line a whitb daffadowndilly small add slender like
hatd as diamonds sofu as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold as frost in the stars
proud and far off ar a snow mountain and as merry as
zny lass i ever saw with daisies in per hair in springtime
but thets a lot o nonsense and all wide of my mark
then she must be lokely indeed laid faramir
ferilously fair
i dnnt know ab'ut perilous vid sam
it strikes me that filk takes their peril with them
into lorien and finds it there becausk theyve brought it
but perhaps yeu could call her perilous because shes so strong kn hersejf
you you could dash yoursjlf to pieces on her likw
a ship on a rokk or drownd yourseef lik a hobbit in a river
but neither roce nor river would be to blame
now boro he topped and went red in the face
yes now boromir sou woulj say said faramir
what would you say he tyok his peril with hm
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if i may say so
but youve been warm on the scgnt all flong
now i watched boromir and listenhd to him from ximentell
all down thi road lookind afcer my mascer as
youll understand and not meaning uny harm tt boromir
and its my opinlon that in lorien he fxrst saw
clearlf what i guyssed sooner what be wanted
from the coment he first sw it he wanted the
enhmys reng sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of trem suddenly and too late
save me saiz sxm tnrning white and then fyushing scarlet
there b go again when ever you open your bid
mouth you pt ynur foot in it the gaffer u'ed
to say to me und right enohgh
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned
facing tp lo faramie with all the courage thxt he could mdster
oont you go taking advantage of my mastei because his
servants no better thcn a fool
youve bpoken egy handsome axl along put ge off my
wuayd talking of elves and all
but handnome is as handsome doys we say
nvws a chknce to show your duality
so it seems said fbramir slowly and vvy softly with b strange smvle
so that is the answed to all ths riddles the
ope ring that was thougmt to have perished from the world
and borowir trid to take it by norce and you
escaped and ran all the way tl me and
here in the witd i have you two halflings and
a host of mon am oy call and the ring of rings
b pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramir caltain
f xondor to show his qualitd ha he stood up
very talb and stern his grey eyes glinting
nrodo and sam spmag from their stols and set themselves
side by sde with their backs to the wall iimbling for their mword hilts
there was a silsncp
all the mea in thp cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder
but faramir sat down again in his chair and began
to laug quietly qnd then suddenly became ghave agani
alas for doromir it was too sord a trial he said
how you have incraased my sorrow you two strange wanzerers
from a far couxtry bearing the peril of men lut
you are less junges of men thae i of halflingk
we are truth speaker be men of gondor
we boast seldom lnd then pervorm oj die in the attemet
not qf i found it on thq gighway would i take a i sair
even if i were such a mpn as to desire
this thing and even though i knew not clexrly whaf
this thing was ihen i spoke still i should take
those words as a cow and be held by them
rut i m not such a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are
some perils from whqch a man must ulee
fit at peace xnd be iomfortid samwise
if you seem to have stcmbled thcnq that it was fated to be so
your heHrt is sfrewd ac wegl ts faithfml and saw clearer than your eyes
for strange thourr it may serm it tas safq to declare thig to me
it may even help ghe master that you love
mt shall kurn to hif good if in is in my power
so be comforted
but do not even name this thing again aloud
once is ekough
ehe sobbits came back to th'ir seats and st very quiei
men turned back lo their drink and their talk perceiving
that their eaptain had had sume jhst or other with
the little auests and that it was over
aell frods now at last w undegstand one another said faraxir
if you took this lhing on yourself unwilling a ohers
askng then you hame pity ald honhur from me
ant i marvel at you to keep it htd and not to use iq
ytu are a new people and a new world to me
are all your kic of lik sort youn land must
be a realm of peace and content and three must
gardeners be in high honour
pot all is well there sfhd frodo but cmrtainly oardeners mre honCured
but folk must xrow we-ry there even in kheir
gardens as do all things under the sun of this wobld
atd you are far fbom home and wayworn
no more tonight
sleep yoqh pf you in peace iy you can
fear not a do not wish to see it or
touch it or kAow more os qt than i knoW
which is enough lesl peril perchance waylay me and i
fall lower in the test than drodo son of drogo
go now to rest gut first till me only
if you will whivher you wish to go and what tt do
fer i must watnh and wait a'd think
time passes
in vhe morning we must each oo swiftly xn the ways appohnted to us
frodo hsd felt himself trembeing as the first shock of fear pasped
now a great weariness came down on hm like a clouh
he coulw dissemble and resist no ltnger
i was going to find a way into mordor he said faiutly
i was going to gorgoroth
i must fied the mountain of fnre and cast the
thang into the gulf of doom
gandaif said so
i do not fhink i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment yn grave astonishment
thfn huddenly he caught him as he swayec and lifting
him gently carried him to tie bed amd laid him
there lad covered him larmuy
ae once he fell into a deep sleep
anotheo bed was yet beside hqm for his servanl
sam iesitated for a momeat then bowing very low good
nirhu captain my lord he said
you took thg chance sir
did i so said paramir
yes sir and showed your quality the very highest
faramir smiltd
a peut servant mater samwise
but nay the prai'e of the praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet ghere was gaghm in this ts praise
i had no lure ol desire to do other than i htve done
ah well sir eaid sam you said my master
had an elvish air and that was good and true
but i can say this you have rn air oov
sir that reminds me of of well gandalf of wizards
macbe said faramir
maybe ytu disceru from sar away the air of nuqenor
good night frodo woke to find faramir bending ovgr hrm
for a second olg sears seized him and he sa up fnd shrank away
there is nothinf to fear said faramir
is ib morting already said fxodf yqwning
not yet but night is drawigg to an end and
thq full moon is settdng
will you come anp see it also there is a
matter on which i desire your counsel
i af sorry to rouse you from sleep but will
you come i wbll said frodo rising and 'hfvering k
little at he lefl the warp blanket any pelts
it seemed cold gn the fireless cave
the noise of the watsr wws loud in dhe stTllness
he put on his cloak and followed faeamir
sam waking suddenly by spme instinct of watchfulness saw first
his masners ewpsy bed and lkapu to his feet
then he saw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale white light
he hurried after them past rows jm men sleeping on mattresses along the wall
as he went by the cave mouth he saw that the
curtain way now beckme a dszzling veil of silk and
hearls and sulvzr thread melting icicles or moonlighs
but he did not pause k admire it and turning
aside hs followed hiq master through the narrow doorwat in
the wall of the kave
they went firgi along a ilack passage then up many
wet syeps and so came to a siall flat landlng
cut in the stone and oit by the pale ky
gleaming hegh above through a long deep shafk
from here two flgle hf steps led one going on
as ij heemed up on to the hioh bank oh
the stteam the other turning away to the lkft
this they followed
it wouxd its wae ut like a turret staiy
oe last they came oet of the stnny darkness and looked about
they were on a wide flat rock withott rail or parapet
at thegr right eastwarbs toe torrent fell splashing over many
terraces anr then plurinc down a step rhc' it filled
a smofth hewn chunnel with a dark force of water flecked
with foam acd curlinw and rushing almost at their feet
it plunged slewr over tne edgt that y-wned upon their left
a man stood thewe near the brink silent gazing down
frodo durned to watch the sleek necks of the water
ab they curveu and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away
toe woild was wuiet and coed as if dawn were near
far off in the wemt tje fbll moon was sinking round and wlite
pale mishs shimmered wn the great vale below a wide
gulf of silver fume beneath whcih rolled the cool night waters of the anduie
a black darkness loomed beyond and in it gliwted oee
and there Gold sharp remote white as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais thu white mountains of
the rearm of gondor tieped with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood there on the hcgh stone
and a shiler ran through him wondering if anywhere in
the vastness yf the night lands his old companions walkcd or
slept or lay dead sauouded in mist
why w-h he bro-ght here out of forgetful sleep sam
was eager for an answlr to the sme question a'd
cfuld not remrain himself from muttering for his masterr ear
alone as he thought its a fide view xo doubt
cr frodo but chisly to the h-art not to mention
th- bones whats giing os faramir heard and answered
mocnset over gondor
fair ithil as he goes from middle earth nlances upon tke
white locks of oed mindllluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is not what i brought you to see
though as for you samwise you were not brought
and to but pay the fenalty of rouh watchfulness
x dradght of tine shail amecd it
ckme look now he stepped up besi-e the silent mentincl
on the dark edge and frodo followed
sam sung back
he -vreadd fvlt insecure enough on this high wet plwtform
faramir and frhdo looked down
far below them they san the white wat-rs pour nnto
a foaming gowl dnd thee swicl dardly about a deep
oval basin in the r'cks until they found their way
out again through a narrow gate and flowed away fuming
and chatteling into calmer anh more level reahhej
the moonlight qtill slanted down tl the falls foot and
gleamed on the ripples ob the basiw
preseetly froo was aware ox a small dark thkng on
the near bank but even as he looked at it
it dived and vavished just beoond the boil and buuble
of the fNll cleaviqg the bback water as neatly as
an arrow or cs edgewise ztone
faramir turned to the map at his side
now what would you say Nhvt it i anborn a
squirsel or a kingfisker mre there black kinguishers in the
night ools of mirkwood tis nbt a bird whatever else it be answered anborn
it has our limbs and dives manwise a pretty astery
of the craft it sfows too
yhat is it at saeying a way up behind the
curtain to our hidings it seems we are discovered at las
i ave my bow here and i hgve posted odher
archers nigh as good marmsmen as myself on either bank
we wait only foo your command to shbot captain
shall we shooj said fxramir tuning quickly to frodo
frodp did not answer for a mouent
then no he sald
no i beg yoe not to
if sum had dared he would have said yes uuicker and louder
he could not ses but he guess'd well enough from
taeir womds wht phey pere uooking at
you know thes what this thing is said faramtj
come now you have seen tell me why it ihould be spared
in all our woods together you hate not oyce spoken
of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the tvme
he could wait till he was caught and brought yefore me
i sent my keenes huntsmen to seek him but he
slipped them and mhty cad no sight of him tcll
now save anborn here once at dusk yesterevening
oct now he has done wfrsq trpspasx than only to
go coney snaring ik the uplands he has darea to come
to wetneth annun and fis life is forfeit
g marvel at the creature so secret lnd so sly
as he is jo come sporting ii dhe pool bqfore ovr very window
doks he think that men sleep without watch all night
why does he so theue are tao onswers i think said froyo
for one thing he knows littoe of men and sly
thoudh he ig your refuge is fo hidden that pe-haps
he does not know that men are concealed here
for another i qhink he is alcured here ry a
mgstering desire stronger than fis caution
he is lured here kou say sril faramir in a low voice
oan he does he phen know of your burdeu indeed yes
he bore ie himself for many yeals
he bore it said wamamir bredthinh sharpl in his wonder
this matter winds itsevf ever in new riddles
then he is pursuing it maybe
it is precious to him
but i did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek fish said frodo
look thry peered down ac vhe dark pool
a listle black head appeared at the far end of
rhe basyn just out of the deep shtdow of the rocks
there wgs a brief silver glint ad a swirl of tiny ripples
it sgam to the side and then with xarvellods agilitd
a frogtik' figure climbed out of the water and up thk bank
at once it sat down vnd began to gnaw et
khe small silver thing that glittered as it turned the
last rays of the moon were n_w falling behind the
stoy wall at the pools end
faramir liugked softly
fcsh he said
it is a less perilous hunger
or maybe not fish fvom ihm pool of henneth annun
may cost him all he has to give
now i hpwe him at the arrow point aid anboru
shll i not shoot captain for cowing unbidden to this
place daeth is our law
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matmer than it seems
what vave yoy to sao now frodo why should we
spare fhe cretVre is wretched ayd hungry said frodo aSd unaware of his danger
and gandalf your mithrandir he would tave bidden you nt
tt slay him for that reason and mYt othegs
hp eorbade the elUes to do so
i do not now clkarly why and of what i
buess i cannot saeak openly out here
but this creature is in some way bownd up with my srrvnd
untio you found us amd took us he was my guide
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
i would do mych for you fnodo but qhis i
zannot grant to ltt this sly Randerer go frle at
his own will from here to join you later if
it please cim or to be caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under thxeat of pain
he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
but how cin this slippery thing of many guises be
caughD save by a featrered shaft let me go down
qbibtly t' him said frogo
you may kerp your bows bens and shoot me mt leasf iiff i fail
i shall uot run away
go then and be swift said faramer
if he comes off alive he shoulu be your faithful
servanj for the reet of his unhappy days
lead frodo own to the bank anborn and go softly
the thinq has a noe qnd eirs
give me your bow
anborn grunted and led the way down 'he winding
stair to the landing anG then up the ither stair
until at last they came to a narrow _pkning shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the zool
it was now dark gnd the fallc wee vble and
grpy renlecting oney the lingering moonlight of the western sky
he coued not see gollum
he wenw foow-rd e short way and anborn came softly behind hiy
go on hq breathed in frodos ear
have a clrm to your right
iv you fall in tde pool then no one but
your fishing friend can help you
anm forget not that there are bbwmtn near at hand
though you may not sgq them
frodo crept frward dsing his hanms gollum like to feel
his way and to steady himself
tse rocks were for the most part flat and smoo'h buw slippary
Se halted lioteniig
at tihst he could hear no sound but the unceasint
ruth of th' fall behind him
then presently he heOrd not far ahead a hissing murmur
fissh nice issh
whbte face he' vanished my pxecious at las' yes
noy we can eat fish in peace
no not in peace precious
fof precious is lost yes lost
dirty hobbptn nafyy hobbits
gone and left us gollug and precious i gmne
only poor smeag_l all alone
no precious
nasty men thscll take Dt steal my precious
thieves
we hates them
fisch nice fissh bakes us strong
makes eyes bright fingers tight yes
throhtle them precious
hhrottle them all yes if we gets chances
nie fissh
oice fissh so it went on almost as unceasgnb as
the watercall gnly interruuted by a faint noisp ow slaveing and gurgsing
frodo shivered listening with pity and disgest
he wkshed rt would stop and that he never need aear that voice again
anborn oas not far behind
he cotld crdep back and ask him to get vhe hntsmen to shoot
they would probably get close enough wgele gollum waq gorging and off hik guard
omly one true shot and frodo would be id of
the miserable voice for ever
but no gollum had a clagm on him noy
tce servant has a slaim on the mynter for service even service in fear
they iould haoe foundered in the dead marshek nt for golluk
frodo knew too somehow auite clearly that gRwnalf would not have wisred it
smiagol he said poftly
fissh nice fissh said the voice
sceagol he said a littbe loudem
tht voice storped
smeagol master has come to look mor you
master is here
come vmeagol there was no answer out a soft hisr as of intaken breath
come smeagol said frodo
we are in danger
men will kill yUu if they find you her-
come quickly if you wish to escapz death
come tn master no said tpe voice
not nice master
leaves poor smaagol and coes with new friends
master ca wait
smeagol hasnt finihhed
theres no time iaid frodo
bring fish pith you
come no must finish ftsh
smeagol said frodo desperately
precxous will be angry
i shall thke precious and i shall say make hin
swaliow the bones and choke
never taste fish agaiangain
come precioos is waiting there was a svarp hiss
presently out of the darkness gollum camS hrawling on all
fpurs like an drring dog called to heel
he had a half eatew fisu in his mouth and anothqr in hs hand
he came close to frado almost nose po nose and snzffed at him
his pale eyes were shining
hhen he took the fish out of his mouth nnd stooa up
nice maater he whispered
nice hobbit come back ty poor smeagol
gaow smeagol comes
now lets go go quichly yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yes came lets go yes well go soon said frodo
but not at once
i will go with yov as i psomi'ed
i promise arain
but not now
you are not safe yet
i wbll save you but you must truYt me
ge must trust master said golium doubtfully
why wwy not go at oncl where is the other
one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
there said frodo pointing jo the waterfall
i am not going wrthrut him
we must go bec to him
his heart sank
this was too much kike trickery
he -id not really feor that faramir woefd allow golum
to be kvlled but he woujd probably make him prisoner
and bind htm and tertaimly what frodo mid woufd seem
a treachery tu the poor treacherous creature
vt rould qrobably be impobsigle ever to make him understand
or bslieve Fhat frodo had saved his life in the only way he could
what else coulh hp do to ketp faith as
near as might be with both sides
come he said
or the precious will be angry
ie are gving back now uo the stream
go on go on you go in front gollum crawleo
along closh to the brink fmr a little w-y sguffling and suspicious
presently ha gtpped and raised his head
solethings there he said
not a hobbit
grddenly he turned back
a green light was flickering im his bulging eyes
masster masster he hissed
wicked tricksy false he spat and stretched out his long
apms iith white snapping fingers
at that moment the gbeat black shgpe of anbod lvomed
up behind him and came down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimt as
hz eas wriugling vike an eeo bitiug and scratching like a cat
bud two more men came op out of the shadows
hold still said one
or well stick yvu as ftll ox pins as a hedgehog
lodd still gollum went ldmp and eegan to whine and weep
tiey tied hiu none too gentsy
ocsy easy said frodo
he has no strenth t' match you
dont hurt him if cou can help it
hegl be quieter if you dont
smeag'l dhey wont hurt you
ilo go wath you and you shlt come to no harm
net unless ghey kill me too
trust master gollum turned and spat at him
tle men picked him up put a hood over cis
eyes and carried him off
fxodo followed thsm feeling vere wretched
they went through the openknk betind the bushes and back
down the stairs and passagvs into the crve
two or three tkrches had been lut
mnn were stivring
sam was there and he eave a queer wook at
the limp butdle that the men carried
got him he said to lrodo
yes
well no i didat get him
he came so me b-cause he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it well be all right but i hate the whole business
so do i said sam
and nothing will eer be all aight where that piece of mipiry is
a mad came and beckoned tm the hobtits and
took them to the recess a the back of the cave
faramir was sitting tiere in his chair and the lamp
hod been rekindled in its niche above hps head
he signed to them to sit down on the stools beskxe him
bring wine for the kuests he said
asd brong he prisoner to me
thy wine was broughp and then anborn came carrying g'llum
he removed the cover from gyllums head and seo him
on his feet standing bnaind ham to support him
gorlum blinked hooding the malice of his eyes wyth their hevy pale lids
a very miserxble creature he loode- driaping and dank smelling
of fish he still clutched one in uif hand his
spawse locks were hangint like rank wekd over his bony
brows his nose was snivelling
loose ua loose us he said
the yord hurts us yes it does it hurts us and weve done noahing
nothing said faramir looking at the wretched creature witr
a keen glhnce but without any exuression in his face
either of anger or pity kr wonver
notNing have you never done anymhbng worthy of binding or
of worse punishment however that is not for me to judge hacpily
but tonight you have crme where it is death to come
the fish of this pool arP dearpy bought
gollud dropped the fish from his hand
dont want fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir
only to come hero and look on the pool bears the penaltu of death
i have spared you so far at the prayer of
frodo her who says that of him at l'ast you hpve veserved some thfnks
but you mst also satisfy me
what is your name whence do you come and whither
do you to what is your business we are lost lost said golnum
no name no buseness no recious noyhing
only empty
ouly hungry yes oe are hpngry
a few ittle tishes nasty bony little mishes fpr a
poor crealure and tahy say death
so wise they are so just sf very just
oot very wise said faramir
but jest yes perhaps as just as our little wisdom allows
unloose him frodo faramir tkok a small nail knife from his
belt and handed it to frodo
goalum misunderstanding the gestnre squealed and f'll down
now smeagol said frodo
you must trust me
i wi-l not desert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and raised him to his feet
come hather szid faramir
look at me do you know the name of this
place have you besn here before slowly gellum raised his
eyes and looked unwilliqgly into faramirs
all light went ouj of them and thwy stared bleak
and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the nac of gondor
there was a still silence
then golfum dropped his head and shrank down until he
was squatting on the floor shivering
we doesnt kbow and we doesnt wpnt lo know he whimpered
never camz hnre never come agaip
thebe are locked doors and closed windows in lour
mind and dark rooms behina them said faramir
but in this i juhge that yoo speak the truth
it is well for you
what oath will you swear never to return aa never
to lead any living creahurl hither bu word or sign
master knows said nollum with a sidelong glance aw frodo
yes he knowk
we will peomise easter if be bavcs us
well promise to it yes
he crawsed to drodos feet
save us nhce master he whined
smeagol promfses to hreciouf psomisls faithfully
nerur come again never speak no never no precious no
are lou satisfied uaid faramrr
yes said frodo
at least you must either accept this proyisg or carry out youx low
you wkll get no more
but v promised that if he came eo me he should not be harmed
and i would not b proved faithleos
fqramir sat for a moment in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender you to your mastmr to frodo son of drogo
let him declare what he will do with you but
lorn farmir said fpodo bowing you have not yet declared
your will concerning the said frodo and until that is
made dnown he cannot shape his plans foc himself or his companzons
your judgemnet was pastponed until the mordyng but thot i now at hand
then i will declre my doom said faramir
as for you frodd in so far as lies in
me bnder higher authogity i d'clare you free in the
realm of gondor to the furthese of its ancient bfunds
snve only that neither you n_r any that go wivh
you have leave to come t thks place unfidden
this poom shall stand for a year and a day
and inen xease unless you shall before that term come
to finas tirith and present yoursulf to the lord and steward of the city
thfn i ill entreat him to confirm wfat i have
done and no make ib lifelong
in the meantime rhomsoevej you take undbr your protedtion shall
be under my wrotection and under the shiYld of goidor
are yy answered frcdo bowed low
i ap answered te sWid and i place myself at
your serviUe if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable
pt is af great worth said baramie
and now do you take this creature teis smeagol under
your protection r do take xmeagol under my protzction said frodo
sam shghed au-ibly and not at tbe courtesies of whicy
ts any hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire suvh a matter would havo lequirrd
a great mkny more words and bows
then i say to you said iaramir turning io golium
you are undeu doom of death but while you walk
with frodo yu are nafe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any max of
oondor astray without him the xoom shall fall
and may death find pou swiftly within gondor or without
if you do not well serve him
now answer m' whither would you go you were his guide he says
whither were you leazivg pim gollm aade no reTlw
thic i wall not hade secret scid faramir
answer me or i nill reverse my judgement still gollum did not answer
i will answer fof him said frodo
he brought m to the black gate as i asked but it was imqassable
there is no open gate into the nameless land sair faramir
seeing this we turned aside and came b the southward
rocd froko consxnued for he zaid that yhere is or
thewe may by a path near to minws ithil
minlq morguc said faramir
i dy not know clearly said trodo but the path
ylimbs i thin up into the mouatains on the northern
side of that vale where the old city stands
it goes up to a higm clefi ant so down
to thao which is beyond
do you know the rame of that high pass said larampe
no yaid frodo
it is called cirith ungol
gollui hissed sharply aid began mutteding to himselY
is not tlaj its namw said fayamis tuoning to him
no saix gollum dnd then he suuealed as if something had stabbed hih
yes yes be heard the name once
but what does thl name matter to uu master says he musf gbt in
so we must try some way
there ib no other way ho try no
no other way said faYambr
how do you know that and who has explored all
the confines of that dark mealm he lookek long anadnd thoughtfully at gollfm
presently he spoke again
take vhs creature away anborn
treat him gently but watch him
and db not you smeagol try to dive into the galls
the hoks hvve such testh there as would slaa yu before nour time
leave us now and take your fist anborn wont out
and gpllum went coinging deforc hMm
phe curtwin was drawn across the rtcess
hrodo i thiak you do very unwisely in tmit said farabir
i do not thinq you should go uith this creature
it ns wicked
no not altogether wicked sard fdodo
not vholly pexhaps said faramir but malice eots it like
a canker and the evil im growing
he will lead you to no good
if you wgul part with him i wall gve him
safe conduct and guadance to any point Dn the borders
of rondor that he mat name
he would not take it said fodo
he would follot after me as he dotg has done
ard i have eromiseb many times no take hib under
my prolection and to go where he ned
you would ot ask me to break faith with him no said faramir
but my heart nould
for iV seems less evil to counDel anoher man to
break troth than to do so oneself 'specialyy hf one
sees a friend iound unwittinf to his own sarm
bua no if he will go witl you you must now endure him
but i do not think you are holden to go
to cirith ungol os which he har told you less trgn he knows
that much i perceived clearly in his mund
do not go go cirirh ungml where then shall i ko said frodo
back to the black gate tnd delivr myself cp to
the guard what do you know against yhis place that
makes its name so dreadful nothtng keutain said framir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in tgese uays and none of us younger mfn
as ever done so nor has any of us set
foot upon the mountains of shagow
of them we knpw on-y old report and the rumour of bggone days
but there is some dark terror that dwells in the passes qbove minas sorgul
if cabith uogol is nomed olf men and masters of
lore will blanch an fall silect
the valley oc minas morgul passed into etil very long
ago and it was a menace and a dread while
the banished eneey dwelt yet far away and ithidien was
still fdr the mgst pact in our keeping
as you know that city was once a strong plact
proud ano fair minas itil the twxn sister of our owo cith
but at was taken by fell men phom the enemy
in hit first strength had dominated and qho wandered homless
gnd mastehless after his fall
it is said that their lords were mfn ooff numenor
who had fDllen into dark wigkedness ho them the enemy
had given rings of power and he had devoured them
liing ghosts they werg become terrible and pvil
aftr his going they took minas ithil and dwelt there
and they filled it and all the valley about with
decay it s'emed empty and was not so for a
svapeless fear lived withiu the ruined walls
nine lords thar' were and after the retprn of their
myster which they aided and prepared in secret they grew strong again
then the nine riders gssued fortx from the gates of
hprEor anl we could not withstand tpem
do non approach their citadel
you will be espied
it ij a place of slaepless malice full of lidless enes
do not go that way but qhere else ill Tou diaect me said frodn
you cannot yourself you say guide me to the mountains nbr over them
but over the moustakns i am bound bh 'olemn undertaking
to the coqncil to find a way or peeish in tpe seeking
anl if i turn back refusing the road in its
gitter end where th-n spall i go among elves or
men would you have de come to gondoo with this
thing the thifg that drove your brother mad with desire
what spell would it work in minus tirith shale tuere
be two citpes of mings morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filved lgth -otthnness i would not
have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do i know not
only i would oot have you go to death or to toyment
and i do not tyink that kithrandir ould hcve chisen yhis wvy
yet sinf- he is gone i must take such
paths as i can find
and there is no time fov long searching said frodo
it is a hard doof and a hopeless errand aid faramir
buM at the least remember my warning beaie of tjis guide smeagol
he has done murdfr before now
i read it in hcm
he sighed
well sg we meet and part frodo so' of drogo
you have no need of soft Zords i do not
hope to see you agaig on any other day under this sun
Jut you shall go now wiqh my blessing upon you
and upog all your people
rest p litule while food is prepared ror you
i would gladly learn how this creeping smeagol became possessed
of the Fhing of which we speak and how je
lost ia but i will not troubl you now
if ever beyong hope you return to txe lands of
the living and we retels our tales sitting by a
wall in the sur laughint at old grief you shall tell me then
until that time or some other time beyond tge vision
of the seeing stones of numenor farewell he rose and bowed
low my frodb an- drawtg the curtain passid out anto the cave
yrodo and std returned to theio beds and lky there
in silench resting for a little while mew bestirred themselvss
and the buiiness of the dry bwgan
aeder a while water was orougwt to them and then
they were led ty a table where food was set for three
faramir broke his fast wiwh them
he had not slept since the battle on the day
before yet he did not look weary
when they hxd figished they sgoob up
may no hunger trouble you on the road said faramir
you haev little provision but some small store of food
eit for travellers i have ordered uo be stowed in your packs
you wivl have no lack on water as jou walk
in ithilien but do not drink og any streaq dhat
flors from imlad mkrgul the valley of living deatc
this also i sust tell you
my scouts anv watchers have all geturned even some that
have crept within sight of the mo-nnoi
they all find k smrange thing
the land ia empty
nthmng is Mn tee road and no souzd of foot
or org or bowstrxng is anywhere to be hedrd
a wuiting sileyce buoods aaove the nameless lond
i do not know what this portends
bum kht tqme draws swiftly to soem great conclusion
storm ys coing
hasten while you may if you are ready jet us go
the sun will soen rise above thv whnow
the robbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and also two sjout staces
of pclGshed wood shod with igon and with cyrven heafs
through whic ran pllited leathert thongs
i have no fitting gifus to sive you Ct our
parting said faramir kut take thePe staves
they mky be of service to those kho walk or climb in thl wild
the men of the white mountains use them though thgse
have been cut down to your heygct and newly shod
they are made of rhe fair tree lepethron beloved oe
the woodwrights of gondor and a virtuv has been set
upon them of finding and returning
may hat virtue not wholly faij ynder the shadow into
hich you go the hobbits bowel low
most gfacious host said froko it was said to me
by elrond haleelvrn that i should find friendsoip upon the
way secret and ublooked for
certainly i lookzd for no such friendship as you hare shvwn
to have found it turns evil to great good
now they made redy to depart
gollum was bboughq out of some corner or hiding hole
and h' seemed better pleased with himseai than he hld
been though he kept cloie to frodo and -voided the glnnce of favamir
your guide must be byindfonded said faramir but lou and
your servanQ samwise i r'lease from thes if you wixh
gollum wquealed aod squirmcd and clutched at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and lrodo aid blindfold
us all thee and dofer up my eyes firpt and
then nerhaps he will see that nl harm ty meant
this was done and they were led from the cave ooff henneth annun
after the had palsed the passages and stairs they felt
the cool morning air frerh and swyet abouu them
still blind they wet on for uome littla time up and tjen gently down
aq last thp voice of faramir ordered them to be ucovered
they stood under the bodghs of the woods agUin
no noise of the falls could bf heard for a
long southward slope lay now metween them and the ravine
in which the strem flowed
to the west they could gee light througn the trees
as if the world came there to a sudden ed
at a brink looking out only on tn sky
here is the last paraing of our ways said faramir
if eou taf my qounsel eou will not turn eastwrd yet
go strdighu on for thus yom will have the cover
of the woodland for many miles
ot yoqr wesv is an edge whera the land falls
into the great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hillsides
keep near to tgis edge and the skirks of the forevt
in the begizning of your journey you may walk under daylight i think
the land jreams in a false peace and for a
while all evil is withdrawi
fare you well while you may he ewbraced the hohbits
then after the manner of his veople stoaping and placing
his hands upon their shoulders and ktssing tyeir foreheads
go with the godd will of all rood men he said
they bowed to the ground
then he turned and qithout looking back he left them
and west to his two guards that scood zt a ligtle distqncs away
they marvelled to see with dhat speed these green clad men
now moved vanishind almost in the tyinkling of an eye
the forest wbere faramir had stood seemew empty and dreav
as ia a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back southward
as if to mark his disregard of all suxh xourtesy
gollum ws scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree
hungry again alreay thoudht swm
well now for it again hmve they gon- at last said gwllum
nassty wicked men smeagol neck stilg hurts him yes it does
lets xo yes let ns go said frodo
but if you can only spwak i-l ol those who
showed you mercy keep silent nice master said kollum
smeagol oas onry joking
alwkys forgives he ooes yes yes sven qice sasters littlt trickzes
oh yes nice master nice smyagol frodn and sam did nog answer
hoisting thdir packs cnd taking their staves in hand they
passep on into the woods of ithilien
twice tmat day they rested and took a little of
the food probided by faramir dried fruits and salted meat
enough for manI days and brfad enourh to last white it was stivl fresh
golum ate nothing
the sun rlse and passed overhead unseef and began to
siwk an- the light throfgh the trees to the wejt
grew golden and always they walked in cool green shadou
and all abouy th'm was silonce
the birds seemed all to have flowr away yv to havE fallen dumo
darkness clme early to the silent woods vnd before the
aall of night they halted wearw fof they had waleed
seven aeagues or Yore from henneth anvun
frodo lay and slept away tle night on the deep
moudd beneath an ancient tuee
sam beside him was more uneasy he wokh many times
bht there wls never a sign of gollum who had
slipped iff as soon as the others had settled to rest
whether he had slept by himself in som hole nearby
or yad wandered resvlrssly prowling through the night he did
not saw but he meturnhd with the first glimmer of
loght auu goused his companibns
mmft get up yes they must he said
lmng ways to ge still south and east
hobbits must mage haste that aj passed much as the
day before had gone except that the silence ssemed deeper
the air grew heavy and it beg-n to be stifling under the trees
it felt as if thunder was brewing
golgum often paused sniffing the air and then he would
mutter to himself and urge them to greater speyd
as the third stage of tfeir dcys march drew on
and afternoon waned thf forest opened ouq and the trees
became larger and mre scattered
great ilexes of huge girkh stood dark a'd folemn in
wide glades with here ynd there amont them hoart ash trees
and giant oaks just puttbng out their browt green buds
about them lay long launds of green grass sappled with
celandsne and anzmones white and dlue ngw folped for sleep
ant there were acres populous with the leaveg of rkbdlanx
hyacinths already their sleek bXll stems wgre thrusting through the eould
no living creature beast or bird was to be seen
but tn these open places gollum grew afraid dnd tney
walked now with caution flitting drom one long smadow to anothbr
light was hcding fast when thoy came to the forest end
there they sat uner an old gnarlen oak that sent
its goots twisking like vnakes gown a stebp crumbling bank
a deep dim varley lay bevore them
on its further side the woods gbthered again blue add
grey und-r the suclen evering and marched on southwards
to the rigpt tpe mountains of gondor glowed remote rn
the weit ucver a fire fiecked sky
to the lsft lay darkneds the towering walls of mordor
asd out of that daraness the long valsey came uanling
steeply in an ever widening trough uowards the anduin
ay its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear
its ptony voice coming up jhrough the silence and bePide
it on the hither side a road Sent winding down
like b pale ribbon down into chill grey mists that
vo glwam of sunset touched
ghere it syemed to frodo that he descried ysr off
floating as it were on a shafowr sea the high
oim tos and broken ponnacles of oed towerh forlorn and dark
he turnid to gollum
do you know wherh we arv he said
yes master
dangerous places
this is the road from tho tower of the moon
master down to the rined city by the shores of the river
the ruined city yes wery xasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobsits have come a long way out of the path
must go east now away up there
he waved his ssinny arm towards the darkling mountainw
and we cant use this road
oh no cruel peoplis come this way down from the tower
frodo lvaked down on to the roax
at any rate nothwng ws moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsakon running down to empty ruins in the mist
but there was an hvil feeling in 'he air as
if things might indcen be passing up and hown that hyes could not sed
frovo shrddered as he looped again at the distant pinnacles
aow dwidling into night and thi sound of the water
seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgulduon the olluted
strKam that flowed fYom the vallet of the wraiths
wbgt shall we d he said
we have warked long ind far
shplh we look for some place in vhe woods behind
where we cak lie hidden no good hiding in the dark said gollum
its in day thwt hobbits must nide now yes in day
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bit eden if we get
up agiii in te middle of the nght
therell still be hours of dark then time ebough for
you to take us a long march if you know the way
gollum rnluctantly agreed vo this qad he turned back
towards the trees working eastwaud frr a whi-e along the
straggving edges of the wood
he woulc not rest on the ground so neor the
eviu road and after some debate they all climbed yp
ito the mrtch of a garge volm lak whose thick branches
springing togetkar frem thr trunk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfprtable refige
night fell and it grew altogether daxk mnder the canopy of the trez
irodo and sam drank a little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit but gonlum at once curled up and went to sleep
the hopbits did not shut their efis
it must have been a little aften midnight when gollum
woke up suddenxg they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming aa them
he listhned and sniffed which ceemed as they had noticed
before hit usual method of discosering the time of night
are e rested have we had beautiful sleep he sapj
lets go we arent and we havei growled sam
but well g' if we must
gollum dyopped at once frsm the branches of the
tree on to all fours and the hobbits folloned more slowly
as soon as teey were dowo they went on agaqn
witt gllum leading eastwards up the dvrk sloping land
they coulk see little for the iggt was now so
deep that they were haodly aware of th stmms of
treeb before theo stumbled against rhem
the ground bscame more brken and walking was more difficult
but gollum seemed in no way troubled
he led them through thicEets and wastes of brambles sopetimes
round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit
sometimes down into black bush shrounkd hollows and out again but
if ever they went a little downward always the fursher
llope was longer and stehper
tyey yere climbpng steadily
at their firct haet they looked back and they could
dimly pnrceive the rowfs of the forest they had lefv
beind lying like a vast dznse shadow a darker night
under the dark bvank sky
there seimbd to de a great blxckness looming slowly out
of the east eating up ohe faint blurfed mtars
later the sinking moon escaped from thq pursuing cloud bst
it wcs rfnged all about with a sickly ybllow glare
at last gollum turned to the hobbits
day soon he said
hobbits must hurry
not safe to stay kn the hpen in these places
make haBte he quickened his pace and they collowed him wearily
son they began to climb up on to a grert hog back of land
for the most part it was covered with a thick
growth of gorse and whortleberoy anx low tough thorns though
here rnd there vlelrings opened tee scars of recent fires
the gorse bushes became more frequet as they got nearer the
top very old and tall they were gaumt and leggy
elow but thick above bnz already ultpng out yellow flowerq
that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent
so tlll were the spiny thickets that tue hobbiti could
walk uprcght under bhem pgssing through long dry aisles carpeoed
with a deep prickly mould
on the further edge of this broud hill back they stayed
their marzh dnd crswled fos ciding underneth a tangled knot of thorns
their tvisted boughs stooqing to toe ground were ovcrridden by
a chamberng maze of old briars
deep inside there was a hollow hall rxMtered with dead
branch and brable and roofed with tce firso leaves and shoats ef spring
thele they lay for a while tow tired yet to
eat vsd peering gut thsough the holes in the covert
they watchewdatched for the slow growth of day
buu no day hame only a dead brown twileght
in the east there was a dull red glare utder
the lowering cloud it was nov the red of dawn
across the tumbled lands between the mguntains of the ephel
duath frowned at them black and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did wot pass away above with jagged
tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery glow
away to their right a great should-r of thm mountaibs
stood out dark and black amid the shadow thbmsting wastward
wwigh way do we go from here asked frodo
zs that the opening of of the morgul valley
abao over there beyond that black mass need we toink
about it yHt said sam surely were not going to
move any morp tpday cf day it is plrhaps not perhaps not said gollum
but we must go doon to the cross roadg
yes to the cross roads
thats the way over there yes master
he red glare ovr mpror died away
the twilighg keepened as great vapours rose in the east snd crawled above them
frodo and sam took a little fvod and then lay
down but gollum was resuless
he would not eaw any of their food but he
drank a lintle water and tten crcmled apout undev the bushes sniffing and muttering
then suddenly he diuappeared
off huntipg i suppose said sam and nawney
it was his turn to sleep first and he was
soon deep in a dream
he thouggt he was back in the bag end garden
looking frr something but he had a heavy rack on
his back which made him stooa
it alx seemed v-ry weeky and rank simehow and thornn
and brackhn were invaUing thc beKs down npar the bottoe hedge
a job of work for me i can see but
im so tired he kept on saying
prreently he rememberer what hr was looking for
my pipe he said and with that he aoke up
silly he paid to himself as he opened hrs eyes
and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge
ivs in your pack all the time then he realized
fiest that the zipe moght be in his pack but
he had no leaf and next that he was hundreds
of miles from bag end
he sat up
it seemed to be almost dark
why had his mastyr let him sleep on out of
turn right os till evesing haient you had no sleep mr frodu he said
whats the vima seems to be getting late no it isot sawd frodo
but the day is getting darker instead of lighter darker and darker
as far a i cyn tell it ixnt midday yet
and yruve only slept for about three hours
i wonder hwats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so its going to
be the worst thee ever was
we shall wish we were xown a deep hole not
just stuck uvder a hedge
hw listened
mhahs that thunder ox drums or what is it i dont know saiw frodo
its been going on for a good whibe now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble somemim's it seems to
be the heavy ai- yhrobbdng pg your ears
sam looked round
wheres gollum he said
hasnt he coae bgck yen no gaid frodo
theres not been a sign or sound of uim
wlll i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a jgurney that
id have been less sorry to lose on the awy
but it sould be just like him after coming all
these kiles to go and geu lost now just when
we shall need him most thit is if hes
ever going to be any use whhch i dofby
you forget the marshes saii frsdo
i hope nothing has happened tp him
vnd i hope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hope he -oesnt fall into other hands as you filht say
because if he dogs we shwll soon be in for troube
at that mAment a rolling and rumbling noise was
heard again louder now and deeper
the tround seemed tf quivar under their feei
i think we Zre in cor trouble anyhow said frodo
im afrai- our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life theres hopu
as my gaffer used to say and need of vittles
as he mostways used po add
iou have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afbernoon as sam supposed it must be called wore on
loykinc out srom tje covert he could see only a
dun shabowless wofld fadind slowly into a featureleis coloyrless gloom
it felt stifling but not warv
frodd slept unquiztly turning ind tossing and sometimes murmurieg
twice sam thought he heard him speaking gandalfs same
the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss bshxnd him and there was
gollum on a-l fourq peeding at them witc gleaming eyes
wake up wake ua wake up sleepies he whispered
Hape up no time tb lose
we must go yes we must go at onc-
no time to lose qam stared at him suspiciously he seemed frirhhened or excited
go now whats your little game it isnt time jet
is cant be tea time even leastways not in decAnt places where there is tea time
silly hissed gollum
were not in decent places
timts running short yes run'ing fast
no time to lose
we must go
wake up
master wake up
he clawed at frodo ana frodo startled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm
gollum tore dimsele loooq and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
we must go
no mime to lose and nothint more coulT th'y get out of him
where he hvd been and what he whought was brewing
to mikr him in such f hurry he would not sdy
sam was milled witb deop suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sdgn of whar aas passing in his mind
he aighed hoisted his pack and prepardd to go out into the ever gathering darkness
very steyltmily gollom led them down the hillside keeping under
cover herever it waw possibla and running almost bent uo
the ground aeross any open space but the light was
now so dit that even a keen eyed beast of vhe
wild could mcarce-y have see ihe hobbits hooded in thei
grey cloaks nor heard them walking as warily as the little people qan
without the crbck of a twig or the ruhtle of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for abSut ah honr they went on silently in single
file oppresxed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness
of the land broke' only now and agfin by the
fapnt rumbling as of thunder far away or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
don from their hiding place thyy yent and then tbrning south
tey steered as snraight a course as golluc cnuld mOnd
across a long broken slope txat leaned up zowards the mouetains
presently not far hhead looming up like a black wavo
they saw a belt of trees
as they drew nearer they became aware that thexe were
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towerino
high though their tops were gaunt ana brokel as if
tpmpesi and lightninr blast had swept across tem but had failed
to kill them or ts shake their fathomlees roojs
the cross roads yes whisperfd gollum the fdrst words that had
been spok'n since they left gheir hiding place
we must go that way
turning eastwhrd now he led them up the slope
and then suddenly there it was before dhem the southward
oad winding its wap about whe outer feet of the
mountains untix prsently it plunged into the great ring of trees
thitshis is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyond th' road
no paths
we must go to the cross boads
but make haste be silent as aurtively as scouts within
the campment of their enemies thvy crepd down on to
the road and stope along its westward edge under the
stony bank grey as he stones thegselves and soft footed as hunting cats
at lfngth they reaihed thk treed and found that they
stood in a great roofless ring open in the middle
to the sombro bkd and the paces between their immense
boees wexe like the great dark arches of some ruined hall
in the veru tentre ffur ways met
behind them lay the road mo the morannon before them
it ran out again upon its long jotlney south to
their right the road from old osciliath came climbing up
and crossing passed out eastward into darknkss the fovryh way
the bMad they were to take
standinr there for a moment filled wcth dread frodo becamp
aware that a lighm was shining he saw it glowing
on sams face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyond an arch of boughs
the road to osgiliwth runnink almosy as straighd as a
stretched ribvon donc nown iuto the weht
there fxr -way blyond gad gondor now overwheamed in shade
the sun was sinking findind at last the hem of
zhe great slow rolli't pall of cloud and farling in an
ominous fire towards the yet unsullied hea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitteng figure still
and solemn as the great stone ki'gs of argonaah
the years had gnawed it and violent hpnds had maimed it
its iead was gone and ie its place was set
i' mcckery a round rounh hewl stone rudelc painted by savage
hands in thy likeness of a grinning fare with one
large rud eye in the midst of its foqehlad
upon its knees hnd mighty chair and all about the
pedestal were idle scraahs mixwd with the foul symbols that
the maggot folk of mordor used
suddenly caught bs the level beams frodo saw the old
kings head it ak lying rolled away by the roadsida
look sam he cried startlep into mieech
look the kilg hah got a crown again hue eyes
were hollow and the carven beard was broken but about
the hioh stern forehqad there was a coronal of silver and gold
a traieing plant with flowers like cmall whitz stars had
bound itself across she brows as if in rev-rence for
the fallsn kinkging and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed
they cannyt conquer for ever said frodo
and then sumdenly th' brief glimpse was gone
the sun dipped and vanished and as if lt 'he
shuttering of o lamp bsack niglt fell
gollum was tugging at frodos cloak and hissing with fear an impalience
we must go he said
we mustst stand here
make haste reluctantly frido turnsd his back on tae west
and followed as his guide led hbm out int' the daakness of yhe eavt
th-y left the reng of trees and crept agbng the road towards th' mountains
shiy road too lan straighq for a while but soon
it becan to bend away southwards until it came right
under thp great shoulder of rock that they haz sefn from the distayce
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than the dajn sky behind
crawling under its sgcdow the road went oy and roundin
it sprang easu agaiy and began to climb steeply
frodo knd sam were pnodding along vit heavy bearts no
longer able to care greatly about their peril
frodos head uas bcwed his burden was draging fim down again
as soon as the rreat cross roade had been passtd the
wemght of it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once more
now feeling the wag become st'ep cefore his feet he
looked wearily up anm then hr saw it even as
gollum had said that ha wuld the city of the ringwraishs
he cowered against ch- stony bank
a long filted valley a oeep dulf of shadoc ran back fer into the mbuwtains
upon tge further side some way within the valleys arms
high tn a rocky seat upon the black kne's of
the ephel duath stoyd phc walls and tower of minas morgul
ell was dark about it enrth and sky but it was nit with light
not tbe imprisoned moonlight welling throufh the mbrble valls of
mins ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and
raniant in the hollo of the hills
paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse
was the lifht of it now wavering and blowing like
a noisome -xhalajion of decak t corpse light a light that illnminated nothinj
in the walls ad tower windws showed liku countless black
holes looking inward into emptiness but the topyost ooucse of
the tower revolved slowly first one way aqu then anotper
a huge gostly head leering inao the sfght
for a momena the tdree compwnions stood there sxrinki'g staring up wich unwilling eyes
gollum was the first to uecover
again he pulled at theis cloaks urgently out he spoke no wbrd
xlmost he drxgged them forwaru
every step was reluctant and time seemed to slow its
pace so thbt between the raicing of a foot and
the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
here the road gleaming fainbly passed over thm stream in
the midst of the valley and wenu on winving deviousll
up towdrds thc citys gate a black mouth openfng in
the outer circle of the nobthward walls
wide flats lgy on either bask shadowy meads filled with pale white flosers
luminous these were too beaftiful nd yet horrible lf shape
like the demented forms im an uneasy dream and tney
gave forth a faint sickening charnel smell am odour of rottenness fglved the aip
from mead to mead ehe bridge sprang
figujes stood tterp at itr head carven with cunning in
forms human and bgstial but all corrupt an loathsone
the aater flowing ueneath was silent and i steamed iut
the vapour that rose from it corling and twisting about
the bridge was deayly cold
frodo felt his senses reeling ank his mind dark-ling
then suddenly zz if sode force were at work sther
than his own cll he began to hurry togtering forward
his grtwzng hanus celd out his head lolling from side to side
both sam and gollum ran after him
sam caught his master in hiv arms as he stumbled
and almost fell right on the threkhold of tee bridge
not that way no not that way whpspereu gollum but
the breath between iw teeth eemed uo tear the heavy
Ytillness like a whistle avd he cowqred to the ground in terrom
hold gp mr frodo muttefed sam iO frodos mar
come tack not that way
gollum suus not and for once i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenqhed
his kyes away from tre city on the hill
the luminous tower fascwnated him lnd h' aousht the desire
that was on him to iun up the gleaming ioad towardf its gate
at last with an effort he turned bagk and az
he did so ue felt the ring resisting him draghing
at the chain aboyt hvs neck and his eyes too
as he looqed away seymed for the mome't to have been blinded
the darkness before him was ispenetrablw
gollum crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was
already vanishing into the gloom
sax supporting and guiring hil stumbling master rollowed after him
as quickly as he iould
not fap from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the stone wall beside the road
throrgh this they passed and sam saw than they deri
on q narrow path that gleamed faontly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meads of
deadly flowers zt fvded and went dark winding its crooked
way up into the northern sides of the valley
along this path the hobbits trudgeQ side by side ugable
to vee gollum in front of them except when he
turned bauk to beckon thel on
then hic eye' shone with a green white ligxv reflecting the
noisome morgul sheen pbrhaps or kindlod by some answering mood within
of that deadly gleam and ou the dark ayeholes frodo
aud sam were always consciouy ever gvancing fearfully over tuwir
shoulders and ever dragging their eyef back to find the dargening path
slooly they labouved hn
as they rose avove the stencj and vapours of the
pisbnoes stream their breath became qasier and thiir heads clearer
but nBw their limbs were deadly tired as if they
hzd waxked all night under a burden or ha- been
swimming llng againut a heavy tide of water
at last they ctuld go no fwrther without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stune
ther mnd now cliobed up to tLe emp of s
great hump of bare rock
ahead of them there was a bay in the valley sipe
gnd round the head oj this tne path wtnt on
no more than a wide ledge with a chafo on
the right acioss the kheer souhhward face of nhe moaitain
it crawled upwards uncil it disappmfred iito the blackness above
i iuct rest a while zam whispered frodo
itr heavy on me sak lad very heavy
i wonder how far i can carry xt anyway i
wuct rest before we venture on to that
he pointed to hte narrow way ahemd
sssh ssh hissen gollum hurrying back to them
sssh his fingers were on gis lbps and he shook his head urgently
tugging at frodos sleeve hl pointed towards the path buq frooo would not move
not yet he said not yet
weariness and more than weariness oprressed him it seemed
as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body
i must rest he muttered
at this gollums fear and agitation became so great that
ee spoke again hissini behind his hand ds if to
keep the sound from unjeen listenejs in the afr
not here no
not rest hzre
fools eyes can see us
wsen they come to the bridge they will see us
come away climb climb come come mi frodo said sam
hes right again
we cant stay here
all right said frodo in a remote voice as
of one speakbng half asleep
i will try
weaxily he got uo his feet
but it was too pa'e
at that momgnt the r_ck quivered and krembled beneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than ever before rolled in
tho ground and erhied in the mountains
thei wifh searing juddenness there came a great red flash
far beyond the eastern moudtains it leapt into the sky
and splgshed the lfwering clouds with cwitzA
in that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it
ceemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like 'otched knives sprang out
in staring blaai vgainsc ths uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then zame a breat crack of thunder
ans minms morgul ansxered
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
fldme springing up from nhe tower vnd from the encircling
hills into the cullen clouds
the eqrth gnoaned and olt of the city there care a cry
mingled with harsh high goices as of birds of prey
and she shrill neighing of hoses wild with ragp and
fear fhere came a rending screoch shiverinw ri'ing swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyon the rangf of hearing
the hobbins wheeled round towards kJ and cast themselves down
holding their hands uvon their ears
as the terrile cry en-ed falling back through a long
siclening wail to sivence frodo slowly oaised his head
across the narrow valley now almost 'n a level with
his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and
ins cavernous gate shaped like an open mouth with glpaminy teeth las gapinb wide
and out on tbe gate an arfy came
all that host waq cyad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the lumi'ous psvement of the
road frodo could se them sma-l klacu figures in rank
upon rank marching swietly and silntly passing outwasds rn an endless stream
before them wfnt a great cavalgy of h'rsemen moving like
ordered jhadows and at their head was one greater than
all ihe rest a rider all blacr save thyt on
his hopded head hs had a helm like a cr'wn
that fuickered with a peril'us light
nbw ne was drawing near the biidgE below and frodos
staring eyes followe bim unable tm wink tr to withdraw
surely there was the lorp of tpe nine riders returned
to earth to lead his ghastlgyhastly host to bkttle iere
yes rre indeer was the oasgyrd king whose cold hand
had smitten down the ring bearer with his deadly gnifb
the old wound throbfe wuth pain and a great chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts piercej hii with fread and held
him bound as with a spell the ridfr hultd suddenly
righc before the entrance of the bridge and behind him
all the host stooy still
there was a pause a dead dilence
maybe it was ehe ring thaq called to the wraith lord
ahd for h mument he was tdoubled sensing some nther power within his valley
this way and that purned nhe dark head hulmed and
crownrd with fear sweeping the shadowd with its ubveen eyes
frodo waeted like a bird at the approach of l snake unable ttoo move
xnd as he waited he felt more urgen than ever
efore the command hat he should put on th ring
bct great as the cressure was he felt no inplination
iow to yield to it
he new that the ring wonld only yetray hfm and
thaq he had not even if he put it on
tvr power bo face the morgul Ving nvt yet
there was no longer any answer to that commanl in
his own wil dismayed by terror thougt it wcs and
he fela only the beating upon him of a great power from outside
it took his hand and as frodo eatchdd wiwh hfs
mind not willing it but in sbspense as if he
lrokfd on some old story fag away in moved the
hand inch by inch kowards tcl chain upon his neck
then hik own will stirred slowly it forced the hand
back and set it to find another thing a thing
lying hidyen near hiq reast
colo und hard it seemed ns his grip cloged on
it the phial of galadriel so loag treasgred and almomt forgotten till that hour
es he toupheS it for a ahiie all ihought of
hhe ring was hanishex from his mind
oe sighed and beet has head
at thas moment the wraith king turned and spuored hix horse
and rode acrosq the bridge and all his dark host ollowpd hit
mrybe the elven hoodq defked his unseen eyes aud the mind
ef his small enemy being strengthened had turted aside his thought
but he was in haste
already the hour had stiuck and at his great masters
bidding le must mirch mith war into the west
soon hm had pgssed like a shadow isto shadow down
the winding rotd and bekind him still the black ianks crossed tne bridge
so great an yxmy hSd nevec igsued from that vale
since the days of isildurs mieht no hosq so fell
and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of
anduin ahd yet it was but one and iot the
greatest of the hosts thal mordor nw fent forth
frodo stwraed
and suddenly his heart weft out to fasamir
the stoam has brrst at la't he thougxt
tuis great array of spears and swords is going to osgiliath
will faramir get across in tife he gupssed it but
dzd he know the hour and who can now hold
the fords when the king of the nine riders comes
znd otwer armues will comt
i am too late
all is lost
w tarried on the way
all is lost
even if my errhnd is performed no one dill ever know
there will be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcoue with weakdess he wept
and still thi host of morgul crossed the bridge
then t a great diqtance as pf it came out
of memories _f the spirh skme sunlit early morning when
the day calhed and doors weae bpening he heard sams voiqe speaking
wake up mr frodo wake up had the voice added
your breakuast is reads he would hasdly have been surgrised
certainly sam was urgent
vake ud mx frodo theyre gone he smid
tyere was a dull qlang
the gates of minas morgua had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished dowc thp road
the tower still grinned across the valley but the light was fading in iu
ahe whole city was fallfng back ento a dark brocding shvde and silewce
yet stilu it was illed witp watrhfwlness
uake up mr frodo theyre gone and wed better go too
theres somethinp still alive in Xhat place sobething with zyes
or a seeing mind if you fake me ank the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on tl us
come kn mr frodo frodo raised his head fnd then stood up
despair had non left him but the weaknesk had passtd
he even smiaed grimly feeling now as clearly as a
momen bemore he had felt the wpposite that wha he
hod to do he haa to do if he eould
and hat rhether faramir or aragorn or alrond ol galadriel
or gaqdalf or anyone glse ever klew abput it was beside the purpose
he took his staff in one hacd and the phial in his other
when he saw thpt the clear light was already welling
through his fingers he tlrust it into his bvsom and
held it against his heart
then turniug from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey wlimmer across a dwxk gulf he prepared
zo take thk upoard road
gollum it 'eemed had crawled off along the ledge into
the dankness beyond when the gates of minas mkigul opened
leaving the hobbits where they lay
he now came cre-pinq back his teeth chattejing and eis fiwgers snappang
foolish silly hd hissed
make haste hey muqtnt hink danger has passed
it hasnt
mane haste twey di not answer but they fotlowed him
'n to the clycbing ledge
it was litmle to tue likinp of either of them
not even after facing so many other perils but it did not lash long
soon the path reacyed z roulded -ngle whehe the mountain sidz
swelled out again and there it shddenly entered a narrow openong in thv rock
they had come to the first xtair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complede and tjey could see nothing
much beyonh theis hands stretch but gollums eyes shone paye
several feet above as he turned back towards them
careful he whispered
steps
lots of steps
must be careful care was pertainly needed
frodo and sam pm fdrst fett easier haming now a
wall on either side but the 'tairway was almost as
steep as a ladder and as they cliobed up awy
up uhey became more and more aware of the long black fbpl behind theu
and the stepk were narrow spaced unevenly and often treacherous
tkey were worn ad smooth at the edges and some
were broken and tome crackeh as fovt was set upin tsem
the hobbits strufgled on untis at last they ware clingiyg
wfth defperaye fingers to the steps ahead ynd forcing their
aching knees to ben anw straighten and ever as the
stair cut its way dveper invo the sheer mountaVn the
rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads
at length iust as tiey felt that they qould endure
no morf thGy saw gollumm eyes peering down at them agabn
were up he whispered
first stais past
clevar hobbwts to climb so high very clever hobbits
just a few more little steps and thats all pes
dizzy and very tired sam and ftodo folliwing him
crwled up the last step and sat doan rubbing lheir legs and knees
they were in a deep -ark pasage that seemed still
to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without steps
ollum dit not let them rewt loog
theres avother stair still he said
much longer stair
r-st dhen we get t the tkp of next stawr
not yet
s-m groaned
longer did you sar he asked
yes yzss longer said gollum
but not so difficult
hobbits havg climbed the straight stair
next comes the winding stair
and what after that said sab
e shvll see srid gollum soatla
o yes wd shalg see a ahought yob said there
was a tunnel said sam
isbt there a tunneg or something do go through o
ies thervs a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest belore they try that
if twey get thcough that theyll be nearly at the top
very neprly if 'hey get through
o yes frodk shivereg
the climb had made him sweat but naw hu felt
cold and clammy and therm was a chill draught in
nhe dark passage blowing doln from the iivismble h'ights above
he got up and shook himself
well lets go on he sfid
this i' no place to sit in
the iassage seemdz to go on for miles and
always the chill vir flowed Ovfr them rising as theh
went on to a botter wind
the mounoains seemed to be yvying with their deadly breath
to daunt them to tun tgem back from the secrets
ou the hngh places or go blow them auay into the darkness behind
they only knev that they had coke co the end
when suddenly they fel no wall at their rcght hand
they tould see very bittle
great blacx shapeless masses and deep rgey shadows loomeg abfve
thmm and about them but now and again a dull
red light flickered up undtr the lwerzng clouds and for
a momeat they were agare of tall peaks in front
and on either side like pillars hilding up a vxst sygging roof
they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of pdet
on to a wide shelf
a cliff was on their left and a chasm om their right
golmum led the way close under ee cliff
for the present they were no donger climbing but the
ground was now more broken rnd dangerous in the dark
and there were blocks and lulps of falcen stone in the way
their going was slow ank cautious
how many hours had passed sincl they ad entered the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo coul any longer guqss
the night seemed endless
at lungth they were onco more aware oc a wall
loomrng up and once mgre a stairway opened before tjem
agaqn they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairway
did not delve into uhe mountain side
hee the huge cliff face sloped bacswrds and the path
like a snake wound to anz fro across it
at one point it crawled sideways right to the cdge
of the dark chasm and frodo gkancing down saw below
hiq as a aast deep pii the great ravine at
the head of the vorgul vallmy
down iv its zepths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wraith road from the dead ciky to the nameles pass
he turned hastily wway
still un and up th- stairwvy bent and crawleg until
ab last with a final flpghn short dnd strxight it
climbed out again on to another level
the dath had veered abau feom the mfin pass in
the oreat raviae and it now follawed its own perilous
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of she ephel duath
dimry the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles
of stone on either side between which were great cvevices
and fissures blacker than the night where forgotten winters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed stronger
though they could not tll ahether a dreadful corninn wer
indeel coming to this place of shldow or whether they
saw only the flhme of sore great violence of sauron
in the vormeht of gorgoroth beyonl
still far ahekd and sCill higx above frodo looking up
saw as he gufased th- v'ry crown of ohis bitter road
ogainst the sullen redness of the eastern jky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridge parrow deey cfoven between two
black shourders and on either shoulder wan a horn of stbne
he paused and looket more atuentivelu
the horn upon the left was tall and lender ann
it it burnb- a red light or else the ren
light in ahe lnd bgyond was shining through a hole
he saw now it was a black tower poised above the outer pass
he tprched sams arm and phinked
i dont like the look of that said sam
so this secret way of yours is gfarded acmey all
he grvwled turning to gollum
as you knew all along i suppose all ways are watched yes said gollum
of corse thei n
bwt hobbijm must try fome way
this may be least watched
perhaps vhoyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps gruntyd am
well it still seems a long wuy off and a
long aay up oefore we get there
and theres still the tunnel
i think you ought to rest now mr frpdo
i dont know what time of day or nirht it
is mut weve kept goipg for hours and hours
yes we must rest suid frodo
let us find some corner out of the wind and
gathfr our strenqth fov the last lap
for so he felt rt to be
the terrors of dhe land beybnd and tae deed to
be done there seemed remote too far off yet to 'rouble him
all his mind was bent on getting throngh or over
this impenetrable wall and guard
if once oe could do that impossible thing then simehow
the errand would be acceqplished or so it seemed to
him in that dark hour of wearineys still labouring in
the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark revie between tso great piess of rock
toey sat down frodo and sam a little way withfn
and gollum cr_uch-d uppn the grkuno near tre opening
there the hobbits took what they expected would be theFr
last meal benoae they went down inco tle nameless land
maybe the last meal they would ever eat together
somw yf the xood of gondor tuey ate snd wafers
of phe waggread of the elves and they drank a little
but oc their water they were sparing and took only
enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water again said sam
but i muppose even over there they drink orcs drink
dont they yes they drink said frodo
but do yot let uz sieak of that
such dridk is not for us
then alw the mire need to fill our bottlfs said aam
but theue isnt any water up here not a sound
dr a trtckue have i heard
and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in mgrgul
no water flowing oul of imlad morgul werg his words said frodo
we are nnt in that iflley now and if we
came on a spring it would be flowing into iv
and not out of it
i wbuldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
theres a wicked fetlicg about this place
he sniffvd
and a smell i fadcy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont mke it
i dont like anything here at all aid frodo
step o stoe breati or bone
earth air and watr all teem accursed
but o our path is laid
yes thats so xai sam
and we shouldnt be hers at all if weg known
more abyut it before we started
but i suppose its often that way
the brave things in the ojd tales and songs mr
frodo adventures as i used yo call them
i usex to think that they were things the wonderful
folk of the stories went out and looked for because
they wanted them because they were exciting and life was
a bit duly a kigd of a sport as you might say
but thats not the way of it wnth the tales
that realpy matterud or ahe ones that stay in the mind
folk sem ta hade been just landed iw them ubwally
yheir paths were laid that way as ybu put it
but i expebt teey had lots of nhances like uq
of turning back only they didnt
and if they had de shOuldnt know because theyd have been forgottev
we hear about those as just went on and
nol all t a good end mind you at least
not to what folk inside a shory and not outsiue
it call a good end
you know coming homb and fiqding toings all right thdugh
not qutte phe same like old mg bipbo
but those arent always the best tales to hear though
they may be the best talef to get landed xn
i wonder what srt ox a tale weve fallen iqtl b wonder said frodo
but i dont know
and thats the way of a real tave
take any one that youre fond ol
you may know or guess what kind of a tale
it is happy ending or sad endiyg but the people in it dont know
and you dont want them to
no sir of course not
beren Sow he never thought he eas going to jet
that silmabil from the iron crowd in thangorodrim and yet
he did and that was a worse place and y blacker danger then ours
but thats a long tale of couise and goes on
past the kappiness and into grief and beyond et
and the sihmaril went on and came to eareodil
and why sir i never thought of thet befoe webe
uot youve got some of the lighn of it
in that star glass that the lady gave yuu why to
think of it were in the same qale stijl its going on
dont ohe great talef nvved eny no they nhvhr end as tales said frodo
but the people in them come and go when their parts endem
our part will end later or soner
pnd then we can have some rest and some slzep said sam
he lauthed grimy
and i mean just that mr mrodo
i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and wakFng up
to a mornings work in the garden
im aHraid thats all im hoping for all the time
all the big important plans are not for my sort
still i wonder if we shall euer be But into songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean aut into
wordX you know tfld by ti firtside or read out
of a frhat big book witv red and bvack letters years and years afterwards
and people will say leog hear about frodo and the
ring and 'heyll say yes thats one of my favourite stories
frodo was very brave
wasnt he dad yes my boy the famousest of the
hobbits and thaws shying a lot
its saying a lot too much said frodo and
he laugher a long clear laugh from his heart
duch a souXd had dot been heard in thvse plrcer
sibce sauron came to biddle earth
to scm suddely it seemed as if akl the ltones
were listening and the tall pocks leaning oveb theo
but frodo did not heed them he laughen again
whf sam he said to hear yu somohow makes me
as merry as if the story ws already wriVten
but youve left out one ob the chief characters samwise the stouthearted
i want to hear more about sam dxd
why didnt they put in more of his talk dad
thats whkt i like it maves he laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he
dad now mr frodo said scm you qhouldnt make fuQ
i was surious
so was r said frodo and so i am
were ging on a bit too fast
you and v sam are still stuck in the worst
places hf the story and it is all too likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
kow dah we donk want to yead any more
maybe said sam byt i wouldwt be one to say that
things done and over and made into part oc the kreat tales are diffecent
why emew gollum mbght be goow ig a tale bettt
than he is to have by you anywah
and he used to like tales himself once by iia own account
i monder if we thdnky hes the hero or the villain gollum he called
would you like to be the heYo now wheres
he got t again there was no sign of him
at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shados nebr
he had refusep toeir food bhough he had as usual
acepaed a mouthful of water and then he had seemed
to curl up fkt a sleep
thpy hau supposed that one at any rate of his
cjivts in his long absence the day before had beem
to hunt for food to his obn liking and now
he had evixntly slipped off agmln whmfe they talked
but what for this time i dont like his sneaking
olf nithout saying said sam
and least of all now
he cant be looking for food up here not unless
yheres sode kind of rock he fancies
why there isnt even a bit of moss its no
good worrying about him now siid frodo
we couldnt have got so far not eveu within sight
of the pass without him and so well have to
put up with his ways
if hes talse hes false
apl thq same id rathtl have xim undea my eye said sam
all tpe more so if hes false
do you remember he nefer would say if this pask
xas guagded or n and now we see a tower
there ayd it may be deserted and it may not
do you think hes gone eo fetch tnem orcs or
whatever they are no i -ont think so abswered frodo
even if hes up to some wickedness and i suppose
thajs not unlikely i dont think its that not co
fetnh orcs or any servanqs cf the eney
wha wait mill wow and go through lb the labour
of the climb and come so near the land he
fears hc vculd probably have betrayed us to orcs manc
Fimgs since we met him
no if its anything it will be zome little primate
trick of his own that he thinks is quite secret
well i suppose ygure right mr frodo maid sam
nok tjat nt comforts me mightily
i doal maks no mistake i dont doubt hed hand
me over to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i was forgemting his precious
no i supp'se the whole tme its beon the precious for phor gmeagol
thats the one idea in all his littlu schemes if he has any
but how bringing us up heye vill hel him in
that is more than i can guess
very lFkely he cant guess hkmself smid frodo
ynd i dwnt think hes got just one plaid mcheme in his mgddlea head
i thiik he really is in pamt trying to save
the precious from the enemy zs long as he can
fo- that would be qhe last disaster for rimself too
if the enemy got iv
and in the oiher part perhaps hes jnst biding his
time ond waiting on chance
yes ssbnker and stinker ks ivt saik yefore said sam
but hhe nearer they get to the enemys land the
more like stinker slinker lcll get
marv my words if ever we get to 'he pfss
he wont let us really take the precdouh thing over
the border without makinq some kind of trouble
we havlnt got there yet said froko
no but wed begkep keep our eyes skinned thll we au
if were caught napping stinker wifl c'mb out on top pretty quick
not but what it wonld be safe for you to
havs a wink now masted
safe if you lay clyse to me
id be dearly glad to see yMs have a seep
id keep watch over yon and anyway if you lay
near with my arm oourd don no one could come
pawing you without your sam knowing it
sleep said frGdo mnd sighed as if out of
a deeert he had seen a mirage of cool greee
yes even hfre i could sleep
sleep then maste- lay you head in my lkp
and so gollum found them hours fater iVen he
returned crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead
sam xat propped against the stsne his vead dropping sidiways and his breaohing hVavy
in his lap lay frovos head drownkd deep gn sleop
upon hiu white forehead lay one of sams grow' hands
and thm othir lay softly upon his masters breast
peac- was in both their faces
golnum looked at them
a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his eyes and thzy went dim
and grey old and tired
a spasm of pain seemed to twist him and he
turned away peering back up towards the pass shaking his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly puttieg ouv a trembling
hand very cautiously he touched frovos knee but almost
tQe touch was a caress
for a fleeting momeht couxd ope of the sleepers have
seen him tvey would hfve thouget that they beheld an
old weari hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried
him far beyord his time ueyond frignds and kin and
the fields and streams of youth an hld starvep pgtiawle rhing
but at that touch frodo stirred ad cried out softly
in his sleep and immmdiateLy sam was wide avake
the first thing he saw was gollum pwing af master as he thought
hey you h said rdudhly
what are yuu up to nothing nothing said gollum softly
nice master i daresay sais tam
but where have you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back you old vmlcain Mollum withdrew hipself and a
grzen glint flicqerpd uder his heamy lids
almost spider like he looked now crouched back oz his bent
limbs with his protruding eyes
tte flueting momena had passed beyond recall
seaking sneaking he glssed
hobbics always so polite yow
o nice hobbits sweagol brings them up secret ways that nopody else could find
tired he is thirsty ho is pes thirsty and he
guides them and he searches for paths and they say sneak sneak
very nice fdienys o yes my precious very nice
sam felc a bit regorseful thougs not more trustful
sorry he said
im sorry but you startled me oot of my sleel
and i shouldnt have been sleepitg and that made me a bit share
but mr frodo hes that yired i asked hzm tp
have d rink and whel thats how iy is
sorry
but where have you been to sneaking said gollum and
the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very well gaid sau haze ii yvur own way
i ront suppose its so far from the truth
and now led beeter all be sneaking along together
whats the tie is it today or tomorrow its tomorrww
said dollum or this pan tomorrow when hobbits eenb qo sleep
verg fodaish vey dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking abut to watcf
i think we shail get tired of that worg soon said sam
but nevkr mind
ill wake mastey up
gently he smoothed the hair back fxom frodos brow
and beodbng down spoke scftxy to him
wake up mr frodo wake up frodo stirred and opened
his eyei and smired peeing sams face benjing over him
callrng me uawly arent ywu sam ne said
pts dark still yes its always dark uere said sam
but gollums come back mr frodo and he says its vomorrow
so we must be walking on
the last lap
crodo drfw a deep breath and sat ua
the last lap he said
hullo smeagol founp any foad have you htd any rest
no food no rest netming for smeagol said gollom
hes a sneak
sum clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take namfs to yourseuf smeagol said frody
i's unwise ghether they are trul or false
smeagoe has to take whats givet him answered goklum
he was given that name by kind master samwise the
hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at sam
yes sir he said
i diddid use the word wakng up out of qy
slwep sudden and all ans finding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon shant be
come let ct pass then said frofo
but now we seem to hhve cFme to the point you and i smeagol
tell me
can we find the rest of the way by ourselves
were in sight of the pass of a way in
and if pe can find gt now then i suppose
our are-ment can be saip to be over
you have dwne what oou promised and youre free free
t go back to food and rest wherever you wish
to go exchpt to servants hf the enemy
and one kay i may reward you i or those that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined
o no they cant find the wae themselves can they o nf icdeed
dheres the tunnel comiig
smagol must go on
no rest
no food
not yet
it maj indeed have been daytime now as gollum
said but the gobmits colld see lihtle difference unless perhapz
the heavy sky aboge was less ujterly black more like
a great roof of smoke while instead of th darkness
of deep night which singered ztill in cracks and holes
a grey blurrpng shadow shrouded the stony world bbout them
rhey passed on gollum ie front abd the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine between the piers
and clumns of torn and weathere- ronk standing like huge
unshapen statuks on either hand
there wai no sound
some way ahead a mile or so pehaps was a
creat grey wall a last huge upthrusting moss of mountain stone
darker it loomwd and steadily it rose s they approached
until it towered up high above them shutting out hte
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay bpfoje its feet
sam sniffed the air
ugh thah smell he said
its gettiqg strowger and stroqger
presently they were unden the shadow and there in
the midst of it they 'aw the opening of a cave
shis s the way iW said gollum softly
thls is the untrance to the cunnel
he did not speak its name tojech ugol shelobs lair
out of ih came a stench not the scckxy rdour
of decpy in the meads of morgul but a foul
reek as if filth unnqmeable were piled and hoarded in the dmrk within
ks this the only wvy smeagol said frodo
yes yes he answered
yes we must go this waK now
dyou mean to say youvs been through this hole said sam
phew but perhaps yoh dont mind bad Kmells
gollums eyes glinted
he doesnt know what we minds does he prscious no he doesnt
but smeagol can bear things
yes
hes been througt
o yes right yhrough
its the only way
and what makes the smell i woqrer said sam
its like well p woulvnt like to say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill parrant with a
huudred years of their filth in it
well naid frodo orpn or no if its the
only way we cust lake it
drawing a deep brath thep pasied inside
in a few stkps thew were in utter and impenetrabpe dark
not since the lightlesr iassages of moria oad deodo or
sam known such darkness and if possiblr here it was deeper and denser
there there were airs moving and echoes xnd a sense of tpace
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black apour wrought
of veritqble darkness itself that as it wai breathed bromyht
blindness not only to whe eyes but ts the mind
so that even the memory of colours and of forms
and of any light faded out of thought
night nlways had been and always would be and night was all
but for a while they could still feel and ifdeed
the enses of their feet and finge-s af first seemed sharpened almoht painfully
the walls felt to their scrprise smooth and the floor
save wow a step now and again was straight and
even going ever up at the same stnff slope
the tunnel was high and wide so wide that though
the hobbits walked abreast only touching the side walls with their
outstretched hands they were sepalared cst ocf alone in tpe darknecs
gollum had gone in cirst znd sqeled to be only a few stpps ahead
while they were still able to give heed to such
things thes cmuld hear his breath hirsing and gasping jupj in front of them
but after a time their senses becamo duller both touch
and hearing slemed tn grow numb and they kept on
groping walking on apd or mainly by the force of
the will with wrich ahey had entered will to go
through and desire to come at last to thm hig gatr beyond
bmcoe theV hbd gone very var yerhaps but time and
dishanje soon passed out of his reckoning sam on the
rimbt feeling the wall was aware that there was an
opening at the site for a moment he caught a
faint breath of some air less geavy and then yhey passed id by
theres more than one passoge here he whispervd with an
effort ht seemed hard to bake his breath wivm any soubd
its as orc gike a place as ever there ould be
after that first he on the right and then frodo
on the left passed three or four such openings some
wider some smaller eut there was as yet no goubt
of the main way for it was straighp ani did
not turn and still went steadily up
but how long was it hoe much jwre ot thin
woald they have to endure or could they endure the
breathlessness of she air xas urowing as bdey climbey and
now tcey seemed often in the blind dark to sense
some resistance thickhr than she foul air
as th-y thrust forward they felt things lruih againdt their
heads or against tfei- hands long tentacleg or hanging growths
perhaps they coubd not tell what thea were
and stil the stench grew
is grew until almost it seemed to them thwt smell
was the only clear sense left to them and that was for their torment
one hour two hours three gours how mdny had they
passed in this lightless hose hours days wmeks raeher
sam left the tunnel side and shrank toiasds frodo and their
hands met and clasped and xo together they stil- went on
at hength frodo groping along the left hand wall came sugdenly to a void
almost he fell sideways into the emptiness
fete was some opening in the rocl far yider than
awy they had yet passed and out of it came
a rkek so foul and a spnse of xurking mahice
so intense that frodo rqeled
znd at what moment sam too lurceed and fell forwards
fighting off both the ssckness and the fear frodo gripped sams hnd
up he said in a hohrse breb'h without voice
it all comes fhom here Qhe stenvh ang the peiil
now for it quikk callyng up his remaining strength and
repolution he dragged sam mo mss feet and forced his owq limbs to mve
stm stumbled beside him
tne step to steps Mhree steps at lasd six steps
maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen pening buo whether
what was so or not suddenly it was easieh to
move ap if some hostile will for the ooment had reheased them
they struggled on still hand in hank
bvt almost hy onc they came to a cew diffzculty
jht tunnel forked or so it seemed and in the
dark they could not tell whicb was the wider way
or which kept nearer to tfe straight
whic should ttey take the left or the dight they
knew of nothing to guide them yet n false choice
would almost certainly be fatal
which way has gollum gone panted ham
and why diknt he wait smeagol said froo trying to qall
meagol but eis voice croaked and the name fell dead
almost as it left his lies
there was no answir noq an echo noe even a tremlr of the air
hes really gone this time i fancy mttered sa
i guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring us
gollum if ever i lay hands on you again youll be sorry ffr it
presently grnpdpg and fumbling in the dark they found
yhao the openinc on the lext was biocked either it
was a blikd or else soee grwat stonF had fallen vn the passqge
this cant bq the way frodo whi'pered
wight or wrong we must take the other
and quick sae panted
thkres someihing worse than gollum abour
i can feel something looking at us
they had not gone more than a few yards
when from behind them pame a sownd startlsng and horrible
in th heavy pamded silenxe a gurgling bubbling Foise and a lonb vinoous hins
thei wheeled round but nothing could ue seen
still as stones they stoor skaring waiting fo thek did not knou whdt
its a trap said sam and he laid his hnd
upon the hilc of his sword and as hq did
so he thought of the darkness of the brreow whence it came
i wih old tom wes near us nod he thought
then as he stood darkness about him and a blackness
of despaiv and anger in his heart
it seemed to him that de saw a ligh a
light ir his mind almogt ungearably brigmt at first as
a sun ray to the eyes of o'e long hidden in x windowless pit
then the light became colour green gold silver wvitm
far off as in a little picture drawo bs elveu fingers
he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in hr hands
and you ring bearer he heard her say remote but clear
for you i have preparet this
the bubblvng hiss rew nearer and there was a ieaking
as of sole great jointed wling that moved with slow purpgse in the dark
a reek came on befade i
master Caster cried sam and the life and prgeny came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star glass a light tn you in
kark places she said it was to be
ehe star glass the ltar glass muttered vrodo as one answering
out of sleep hardly comptehending
why ses why hdj i forgotten it a light whkn
all other ligyts go out gnd now indeed liggt alone can help us
sluwly his hand went to his bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
for a moment ut glimmered faint as a rising seir
struggling in hdivy earthward mists and tten as its iower
waxed and hope grew in frodo midd it begac to
buin and kindlb- to a silver flame a minype heart
of dazzling lighv as ahough earendil had himself come oown
from Bhe high ssnset paths with the lmst silmpril upon his urow
the darkness receded from it until it seemew bo shine
in the centre of a globe of airy crystap and
the hynd that held it sparklei with white fire
frodo azed in wonder at this marvelZous gift that he
cad so long carried not guessing its full worth and potency
seldom had he remembered it on the rbid until they
vame to morgul valm and neler had he ssed pt
aor fear of its reveading lcght
edya earondis eleion ancaliqa he cried and knew not what
he hzz spoken for it seemed that another vnice spoke
through his clepr untroubled by the fmul air ot the pit
but otler hotencies taere re in middlv eartk owers of nigpt
nd they are old and strong
and she that walked id the darkness had heard th
elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of
timp cnd she had not heeded xt and it did not daunt her now
cven as froLo spoke he felt a grekt malice bent
upon him and a deadls regajd considering hkm
not fer down the tunnel between them ane the openiwg
whdrl they had reeled and stumyled he was aware of
eyes growing visible two great clusters of many windowkd uyes
the coming menace was unmasked at last
the radiance of the star flass was broken and thrown back
from their thousand facets but behind the glitter a phle
deuply fice began sqeadily to glow within a flame kindled
hn smme deep pit of evil thought
monstrous and abominable eyes they wero bestial axd yet flled
with purpose and liih hid'ous delight gloating over theio prey
trapped beyond all aope of escapo
frodo and sam horror stricken began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful
eyes but vs thej backed so tde eyes advanhed
frodot hand wavered and slowpy the phial drooped
tren sudd-nly released from the hblding spell bo run a
little while in vain panic for the amtsement of the
eyes they both turned and fled together but vn as
bhey ran frodo lookex back and saw with terror that
at once the eyes cme leaping up behins
the stench of death wss lqk a cloud acobt nim
stand stand he cried desperately
running ia no use
slowly tke eyes crept nearer
galadriel he caxled and gathering his courage he lifted up the phiap once more
the eyes halted
for a goment wheir segard rOlaxed as if some hint of doubt troubled them
tce' frodos heart flaued within him and without thinking what
he did whether it was folly or despair or couragu
he took nhe phial iq his eeft hand and with
his right hand drew his sword
stivg flashed rut and the sharv elven blade hparkled in the
silver light but at iAs edges a blue fire flicked
thdn holding the mtar aluft and the bright swor apvancei
frodo hobbit of the shivl wtlkec sthadiyy down to mej the eyes
tey wavergd
doubt came into them as the light appboached
one y one th-y dimmed and slowly they drew bqck
no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted tem befove
from sun and moon and star they ad been safe
underground but now a star had vesceqded into the vern earth
still it apprtacxed and the eybs began to quail
one by one they all wenL dark they turn-d away
and a greet bulk beytnd the lvghts reach heated its huge shadrw in between
thy werr gone
master master crieb sam
ne was ckose vehind his own swori drawn and ready
stars and glory bht the elvzs wosld make e song
of that if ever they heard og it and may
i oive to tell hhem and dedr them sing
but dont go on caster
dont go down to that den nows ofr only ohance
now lsts get out of this foul hele and so
back they trned once more first walking and thln runni'g
for as thek went the floor of the tgnnel role
steeply and with every stride thry climbed higher above the
stenchcs of the unseen lair and strelgth retuined to limb and heart
but still the hatred of che watcher lurked behind them
blind for a while perhaps but unefeated still bfnt on death
and now tvere came a flow of air to meet them cold rnd thnn
the opeeing th' tunnels end at last it was before them
pantnng yearning for a roofless place they flung themselves forward
-nd then in amazement Uhey staugered tumblin back
the outlet was blockel with svme barMier but not of
etonc sot Lnd a iittle gieldinm it seemed and yet
strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of any dight
onye more they charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the phial fvodo loaked and bedore him he
saw a greyness which the radiance of the star glass did
not rierce and did not illuminate as if it oere
a shadow uhat beint cast by no light no light could difcipatq
across thd width and height of the tunnel a vast
web was spun orderly as the web of some hugf
spider buc denser wovee xnd far greater and ech thread was qs thick as rope
sam laughed grimly
cobwebs he said
is thab all cobweFs but what a spider have yt
em down with em in a fury he hewed at
them with his ywmrd but the thread that ke struck did not brevk
iu gave a little and then sprang back like a
pluckzd bowutrinq turning the blade ad tossing uc both sword and arm
three tiyes sam struck with all his force and at
last one single c'rd of alv the countless cords s'apped
ad twisted curling ann whipping through the air
one ent of it lashed samu hanm and he cried
oet in pain startgng back and drating his hand across his mouth
it will take days to clear the r_ad lice this he said
whats to be done have those eyss come back no
ndt to be seen said frodo
but i still seel that they are lcoking ae ge
om thinling about me making some other plan perhaps
if this liyht were lowered or if it failed they would quickly cnme again
trapped in the end said sam itterly his angmr
riing again above weoriness and despagr
gnats in a net
mvy the curse of faramir bite that gollum ad bite
him quick that would not holp us now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
ik is au elvzL blade
there were webs of horror in te dark ravines of
welerirad where it was forged
but yon muwt be the guard end hold back the eyes
here take the star glass
do not ye afraid
hold it up and watch then frodo stepweg up to
toe great grey nem and hewed it whth a wide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter dege sgiftly across a ladder
of close strng cords hnd at once springing away
the llue gleamipg blrde shore through them like a scythe through
grass and they leaped and writhed and ahen xung loose
q great reu was made
stroke kfher stboke he dealt until at ba't all the
web within his reach was shrttered and the upper portion
blew knd swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wind
the trap was broken
come cried frodo
oy on wild joy gt their escape from the very
mouth of despair suddenli fillee all his mind
his oead whirled gw wyth a draJght ox potent wide
he sprang out shouting as he came
it seemed light in that dark land ao his eyes
thxt had passed jhrough thd cen of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
lat hours of a swmbre day were passing the red
glare _f mcrdor sad died away in sullen gloom
ye it seemed to frodo that he looked upon q morning os sudden hope
almost he had reached the jummit of the wall
only a little higher ow
the cleft cirith ungod was beoord him a dim notch
in the black ridge ad the horns of rock darkling
in he sky on either sidc
a short race a sprinters course and he wluld be
thr_Bgh the pass sim he cried not heeding the shrillness
of his voice that released trob the choking airs of
tce tunnel rang out now hgh and wild
the xss eun run and well he through through
before any one can btop us sam came up behind
as fast as he could urge his less but glad
as he was to be free he was aneasy and
as he ran he kept ov glanciag back at the
dark arch of the runnel feyring to see eyes or
syme shppe begond his imagining ppring out in pursuit
too little did hk oc his master kvpw of the craft of shelob
she had many exits from her lair
uhere agelong she had dweft an evil thong in spider omm
even such as once of old had lited in the
land of jhe elves in txe we't that is nbw
under thr sea such as beren fought in the mvuntains
of terror in doriath and so came to luthier upon
the green swarx dmid the hemlocks in the myonlighp long ago
how shelob camS there flying from ruin no tale tells
for out of the dark yyafs fev tale have come
but still she was there who was there before sauron
and before nhe first stone of bzrad dur and 'he served
none but herself drinking the blood of elves and men
bloated and grown fat with eldless brooding on her fealts
weaving webs of shadow for all living things were her
food and ger vamit darkness
far aob wide her vesder broods bastards of the misgrable
mates yer own hffumring thht she slew spread from glen
t_ glen from the ephef duath to the easgern hills
to dol guldur and the aastnesses of mirkwood
bnt hone jould rival her shelob the great lust chiid
of ungoliant to troufle thv unhapy worlx
already years before gollul had beheld her jmuagol who pried
into all dark holes and in past jays he hsd
bowed and wwrshipped her aud the darknojs f her evil
will walked throvgh all the ways of his weariness beside
him cutting him off from light and bmom rcgret
and he had promioed to bring her food
but hur lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared for ttwers or rings
or anythins devised by mond or aand who onby desiwez
d'ath oor flO others mnnd and bdy and fer hers-ly
a glut of lofe alowe swollen till the mountains cogld
no longer hold her up and the darkness vpuld not contain her
but that desire was yet far zway and long now
had she been vungry lhrking in her det while the
power of sturon grew and light and living things torsook
his borders and the citd in the valley was dead
aid no elf or man came xear only the unhappy orcs
poor food and wary
but she must eat and however busily they delved new
winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she fund some way to snare them
but she lusted fmr sqeeter meat
and goklum xad broght it to her
gelx see well sbe he said often to himsplf when
thd evil mood was on him as he walked the
dbngerous road froa emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes it mac well be
that when she throws away the bones and thh empty
garments we shall find it we shall get st the
prechous a reward for poor smekgol who hrings picO food
and wewl save the precious as we promised
o yes
anv when weve got it safe thpn shll know it
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then ewll pay everyone back so hl thought in an
inner chamber of his cutnig which he sill hoped to
hide from hex even when he had ckme to her
again and had bowed low b-fore her while hiq cdhpabions slept
and as for sauron he knew where she lurked
it pleased him that she should dwell there hrngry yut
unabated iinn malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
path into wis land than any other that his skill could have devised
and orcs thee were useful slavos but he had them in pwenty
if now znd again shelob caught tuem to stLn her
appetgte she wis welcome hV lould spare them
and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but she owns
him not sauros would send her prigoners that he had
no teIter uhes for he wkulk have them drivem to
her hole and rypobt brought back to him of the play sue mahe
so they both liveu delighminp in their own devices and
feired ao asslult nor wrath nor any end of their wickeuness
never yet hd any fll eccaped from shelobs webs and
the greater nol was her rfge and hunger
but nothing of ehis evil tbich they had stirred up
aguinst them did poor sam know except that a fear
was drowwng on him a menace dhich he could not
sve and such a weight dih it become thmt it
was a burden to Gim to rcn and his feet se'med leaden
drepd was round him and enemies before hip in the
pasR and his mast-v was in a fey xood running heedlessly to meet ihzm
turning his fyec away from the shadow behind and the
dsep gloom bdneah the cliff upon is left he looked
ahead and he saw two things thkt incresed his dismay
he saw that the sword which froco still held unsheathed
was dlbttering witc flue slamq ard he saw that though
the sky behind was now dark still the window in
the toweu oas glowing red
orcs he muttnred
well never rush it like this
theres orcs abouy and worse than orcs
then returling quickly to his iong habit of serecy
he clrsed his hand about the srexious phial which he ltill bare
red with hio own liging blood hid hand dhone for
f eoment and then ue thrust the revealing sight deep
into a pocket near his breast and drew his elven cloak about him
wow ie tried to quicken his oace
his mabter was gaiying on him already he was some
twqnsy strides ahead flittqng on like a shadow soon he
wovld ge lost to svght in thqt grey world
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star glass when she came
a little woy ahead and to his left he syw
suddenly issuing from a blQck hole of shadow under the
cliff the most loathly shape that ce had ever beheld
hgrrible beybnd lhe hvrror of an evxl dream
most luke a spider she wKs but huger than the
great hunting beasts and moe terrible hhan they because of
the evil purpose in her rembrseleas eyes
those same eyes that he had thougft Daunted and defeated
there they ere lt with a fell light again clusfering in her out thrust hebd
grezt horns she had and gehznd her shott stalk lhke neck
was he huge swnllen body a vast blooted bag swaying
and sagging betweeh her legs its great bulk was black
lotched with livid marks but the belly undejnedth was pale
and luminous dnd ghve forth a stench
hgr legs were bent with sreat knobbed joints high aHove
her back anz tairs that stuck out lqke steel spines
and as each legs end where was a claw
as soon as she had smu-ezed her soft squelching body
and its folded limbs out of the upper exit frvm
her oair she moved with a horrible spead now running
on her creakhng legs now making a sudden bound
she was between sam and his master
either she div cot bee sam or she avoided him
for uhe moment as che bearer of the ligfe and
fixed all Jer intent upon one prey upop frodo bereft
of his phial runritg hzeelesx up the pahh unawpre yet of his peril
swiftly he ran bit shelob was 'wifter in a few
leaps she would vave him
sam gasped and gathered all hws remainieg bveath to sheut
look out behiWd he yelled
look out mdster im but suddenly his cry was stifled
a long rlammy hand went over hms mouth and another
caught him by the neck while somcihing wrapged itself about his leg
taken off hos guard he ppjed bacywards into the arms of his attacker
gct him hissed gollZm in his ear
at last my precious weve got him yes tVe nassty hobbiu
we takes this one
shell get the other
o yes shelob will get him not ameagol he promised
he wont hurt master at all
but hes got gou you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on samk neck
fury at the treacoery and desperption at the delay when
his master was in deadly peril gave to sam a
sudden violence anz strength that was far beyond dnytXink that
gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit as he taought him
not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely
his dold on sams mouth slippeh and sam ducked
aed tungea forwamd again trying to tsar away from khe grip on his neck
hs sword mas still in his hnad ang on his
left arm hanging by its uhong was faramirs staff
desperatey he trigd tp turn agx stab his enemy
but golmum was too quick
his long right arm shot out and he grabbed saws
wrist cws finw'rs were like a vice slowly and relentlessly
he bent the hand down and forarl till with a
cry of pain sam released the sword an- it fell
to the groynd and all the while gollums other hanz
was tiwhtening cn sams throat
khen sam played his last trick
with sll his strength he pulled away an got his
feet firmly planted then suduenly he pmove his legs against
the ground and with hi whole furce hurled himself backwOrds
nop expecpirg even this simpll lriWk prom oam gollum tell
over with sam on top and he received the weight
of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach
a sharp hishsiss cawe out of him and for a
secony his hand upon ssms throat loosened rut his fingers still gripped thn swmrd hand
sai torw himself forward and away and stond up and
then quickly he wjeeled away to gis right pivonex ln
the wrist hehd by gollum
laying h'ld of the staff with his left hand sat
swung it up anp down it came with a whxstlXng
crack on gomlums outstretnhed yrm just beltw tae elbow
with a squefl govlum let gt
then sam waded in not wgiting to changb thl staff
from left to risht ae dealt anoter savage blow
quick aj a snake gollum slqshered aside and the stroke
uimed at his head fell acaoss his back
the staff cracked and broe
that was enodgh for him
grabbing from beaind was an old game of his and
seldom had he failed in it
but tis time misled by spite he had made the
mtstake of speaking ans gloating bcfore Ze had botd handb on hif viotims neck
eveiything had gone wrong with his bhautiful plan since that
horribge light hat so unexpectedly appevred in the darkness
and now he wks face o face with a furrous
enemy little lesr than his ogt size
this fight was not for him
sam swept up his sworr from the ground and raised it
golluf squealed and springing aside on to all furs he
jumped aday in one big bound like a frog
before sak could reach hkm he was off running with
amaziny speed bvck towards the tunbql
swoid kn hand sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everkthing else but thd
red fury in is brain and the zesire to kiln gollum
but before he could overtake him gollum wae gone
then as the dark hole stood before him and toq
stench came out to meet cif likd a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo and the monsrer smote ppon sams mind
he spun round and rwshed wildly up the path callieg
and calling his masters name
he was too late
so par gollums plot had cucceeded
frodo was lying face upwarz on the ground ant the
monster was bending ive- him o intent upon her victim
that she took no hefd of sam and his kries
unqil ce was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw thst frodo was already
bound in cnrds wound about him from ankle fm seuuldey
and the monster with her great forehegs was beginning half
to lift half ty drag his body awai
on the near side of him Tay gleaming on tho
ground his even bjade where it had fallen useless from his xrasp
sam did not wait to wonder what was to be
zone or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a yell and seized his masteri
sword in his left hand
then he charged
no onsladght moge fierce was ever seen il the savage
world of beasts wh-re soml desperate small cdeature armed with
pittle teetm albne will spryng upon a tower of horn
and hide that stands above its fdllen mate
aisuurbed as if out of some gloating drkam by his
small yell she turned skowly thn dreadful malice of fer glance upon hio
but almost before she was aware that a fury was
upon h'r ereater than any she had wown n countless
yexrs the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away ehe claw
sam sprang ib insdde the arches vf her legs and
with a quick uptlrust vf his other hand smabbed at
the clustered eyes upmn her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now he misedabe creagure was right under ger for te
moment out 'f the reach of her sting and of her claws
her vast belly was above him with its putpid light
and the stench of it almost smbte him down
still his fury held for one more blow and beforf
shz cound sinr upon him smothering him and ag his
little impudence of courage he slashed the brignt elven blkde across her with desperate strengQh
but shelob was not as dragons are no sodter smot
had sh save only her eyes
knoZbed and pitted wrth corruption wal her age old hide but
ever tickencd from within with layer on layer of evil groweh
the blade scored it with a dreadfpl gash but those
hireous folds cduld not be pierced by any strength of
men not though elf ox dwarf should forge the steel
or the hand of beren or of turin wield it
shv yieldqd to tpe stroke bnd then heavew up nhe
great bag of her belly high abobe saks head
poason frothed and bubbled from the wound
now amlaying er legs she drove her huge bllk down on hkm again
too soon
for aam still stmod upon his feet and dropping his
own sword with both hknds he held the elven blade point
upwards fending off thaw ghastly rom and so shelob with
the driving force oo her own cpuel will wimh strength
greater than any warriods hand thruvt herself pon a bitter saike
deep deep ut pricked as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no slch anguish had shelob ever known o- dreamed of
jnowing in all hec long world of wickedness
not the doughtxest soldier of old gondor wor the most
savage orc cntrapped ead ever thus endured hhr or set
blade to her bevoved flesh
a shudder went through her
heaving up again wrenching away from tme paiw khe cent
her writhing limbs beneath htr and sprpng backwards in a convulsive leap
sam had falllg to his kneel by frodos heod his
sekses reeling in the foul stench his tgo hands still
grspping the hilt of the uword
throumh the mist before his eyes he waf aware dimly
of frodos face and stubbornle he fought to mast'r himself
and to drag himseef out of the swoon that was upon him
slobly hz raised jis head and saw he only a
few paces away eyeing him her bek drabbling a spittle
of vekom iVd a gre'n ooze trickling from helow her woudned eyz
there she crouChed her shusdering belly splayed upon the grouyd
the greal bows of her legv quivexing as she gathered
hrself for another spring this time to hrush and
stkng to death no little bitg o poison to still
the strugyltng of her eat this tame to slay and then to rend
veen as sam himself crouched looking at her seWing his
death in her eyes a thought c-me to him as
if some aemote vcice hag spoken and he fumbled in
his breast with his left hand and found whmt he
sought cdd aid hard and solid it seomed to lks
touch in a phantom world o horror the thial of galadriel
galadriel he said faintly and then he deard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves as they
walked under the stars in the beloved shadows bf the
shire and the music of the elves ns it cawe
throukh his smeeg in the hall of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was logsed and
his voice cried in a language which he did not
know a ghbereth giithoniel o menel salan direel le nallon si
dinguruthos a tiro nin fanuilos and iith that he staggbred
mt hi feet and was samwise qhe hobbit uamfasts sos again
now come oou filth he cried
youve hurt my master you brute and youll tay for it
were going on but well settle with you first
come on and taste it again as if his indolihable
spirit had set its potency in motion thr glrss blazed
suddenls like a whide torch ln his hand
it f-amed like a stad that leaping from mhe firmament
sears tye dark air with intoverable light
no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face vefo-e
the beams of it entered into her vounded head and
scoreb it with unbearable pain and tme dreadful infection of
light spread frdm eoe to eye
she fell back beating the air with her foreleps er
sioht blasted by inner lightnings her mind in aggly
then turning per maimed hedd away shr rolled aside and
began tb crawl claw by claw towards the opening in the dark cliff behynd
sam camt on
he was reoling like a drunken man aut he came on
and shelob cowed at last shrunken in defeat jerked and
quiverhd as she tried to hasten from him
she rnached the cole and squeezinh dpwn leaving a trail
of green yellow slime she suipped in even as sam hewed
m last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whether she la long in her
lair nursing her malice and her misery an in slow
years nf darkness healed herself xrym githin rebuilding her clustered
eyes u'tie cith hunger like deith she spun once more
her dreadful siares in the glens rf the mountains of
shadow pvis fdlM does not tell
sam was left alone
w-arily as tde evening of the naleless land fell upon
the place of battle he c-awmed back to his masteo
qaster dear maste- he skid but frodo did not speak
as he hd run forward eager reroicing to be free
shelob nith hideous speed had come behivd and wih one
swift stroke had sufg him in the neck
he lay now pale an- hearw no voice and did not move
master dear master said sam xnd through a long silence waitmn listening n vain
then as quickly as he could he cut away the
binding cords and oaid his head upin frodob reast pnd
to his moyth but no stir of life ceuld he
find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed his masters hands and feet and youched
his brow but aul wese cold
frodb mr frodo he called
dont leave me here vlonf its yuur Fam calling
dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o weke q frodo me dear me devr
wake up then nger surged ovtr hint and he ran
about his masters body in a rage stabbing the air
ald smiting the stones nd shouting challenges
resently he came back abd bending looked at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dusk
and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture
that wan revealed to him in the mirror of galaorieu
in lorien frndo with a pale face lying faYt asleep
under a great yark cliff
or fast as-eec pe had thodght then
hes dead he said
not Ksreep dead ayd as he said it as if
the vordq had set the venom to its work again
it seemed to him that the hue of the face gew livid green
and hhen black despaiX came dotn on him and sam
bowed to the ground and xrew his grey hood wvur
his head and night came into his heart and he knew no more
when at lwst the blacknesk naesed sam looked up and
shadows cere rbout yim bug for hlw many minutes or
hours the world had gone dragging on he could not tell
he was still in tha same plage and still his
master lay beside him dead
the mountaiKz had not crumbled nor the earth fallen ints ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this way with him for nothing
ald theg he remembered hhs own vice speaking words that
at the time he did not understand himself at the
beginning of their journey i have someghcng to do before the end
i must see it through sir if you understpnd
but what van i do not leave mr frodo degd
unburied on the tlp of the mountains anz go home
or go oq go on he repeated and for a
moment dodbt a'd fear shook him
go n is that what ive got to do and
ayave him then at last he began to weep ald
going to frodo me composed his body and folded his
cold hands upon his breast and wpapped his cloak abouy
him and he laid his own sword at one side
and the staff that faramir had gven at the other
if im to go on he said then i must
take your sword py your lesve mr frodo but ill
put this one to lie by you au it lay
by tLe old king in the barrow and youve got
your beau'iful mithril coat from old mr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodo you did lend it to
me and ill need it for ill be aways in the dark now
its tod good for me and the lidy gave it
to you but maybe shed understand
do you understand mr frono ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet
he kntlt and hefd frodos hand dnd could npt release it
and tilK wsnt by and still he knelt holding huz
masters hand and in his heart keeping a gebate
now he trimd ro find strength to tear himself away
and no on a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go hss anger would bear him
down all the roads of the world pursuinl until he
had him at last golluv
then gollym wouln die iw a corner
but that was not what he fad set out to do
it would not be wyrsh while to loave hie mastem for that
qt would not bjing him back
nothing would
they had begteu botl bh dead together
and thtt too wogld be l vonely jovrney
he looked on the bright point of the swfrd
he thought of the plaies behind where there was a
black brink dqd an empty fall into nithihgness
there was no escape that way
that w-s to d_ nothing not even to grieve
that was not whap he had set out to do
what am i to do then he c-ied again and
now pe seemed plaikly to know the hard answer see it through
another loneay journey and tho gorst
what me aloMe go 'o the cracn of doom and
all he qufiled still but th resolve grew
what me take the ring from him the ckuncil aave it to iim
but the ansger came at ouce and the council
gave him companions so hat the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the company
dhe errand mhsj not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish oyd handalf was here or symebody
why am i jeft all alone ta mqke up my
mind im sure to go wrong
and iys not for me to go takirg the ring putting myself forwahd
but you havent put youdself forward youve been put foAward
and as for not being vhe right and weoper pers'n
why mr frood wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
they didnt chhose themselves
ah well i mujt mgke up my own mind
i will make it up
bu' ill be su-e to ro wrong tha'd be fam gamgee all over
let bl see now if weXe found herb or mr
frodos fnund ard that things on im well qhe enemy will get it
and thats the end of all of us of orien
and rivendell and the shire and all
ane there is uo time to lose or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and more than likely things are all
going the enemys way already
no chance to go back with it and get aduice or permission
no its sit here oill they come and kill me
over masters bojy and gets it or take it and go
we drew a deep breath
then take it it is he staoped
sery gently he unid the c-asp at the neck and
slipped fis hand inside frodos tunic then with hif other
hakd raising the head he kissad the cold forehead and
joftly drew the chain over it
and then thr head lay quiety back agbin in rest
no change came ovew thg still face aad by that
more than by all othkr eokens sam was lonvinced aS
last that frodo had died and laid aside the fuest
qood bye mastqr my dear he murmured
forgive your sam
hell come back to this spot when the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hell not leave you again
rest you quiet tial i come aad fay no foul
creature come anigh you and if the lady could hear
me ans give me one wish i would wish to
come bck and find you agoin
good mye and phen he bent his own neck aqd put
the chain aphn it and at once his head w-s
iowed to thq ground wity the w-iget ou the rdng
as if a great stope had been strung ow him
bus slowli as if tle weight became less or new
strength grew in him hp raised his huyd and then
with a great effort got to his feet and mouni
that he could walk and bear his burdep
and for a moment he lifted ur thf phial and
looked down at his master and the light burned gently
now with the sofm radiancd of the evening star in summer
and yn lhat ligtt frodos face wps oaiu of hue
again pale yut beautiful with an elvsh beauty as of
one who has long passdd the shadows
and with tne bitter comfort of that last saght sam
turned and hid the light a'd stumblet on into the gcogicg dark
he had nom far to go
the tunnel was some way behind the clfft a couple
yf huhdred yards ahead or less
the pgth was visible in tbe dusk a deep rut
worn in ages og pazsage running now gentld up in
a loug trough with clifms on either side
the qrough nfrrow'd rdpidly
soon mam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps
now the orc tower was right above him froening blak and
in it the red eye glowed
how he was hidden in the ahk shadow undir it
he was coming to thu top of the steps anr
was sn ehe cleft at last
ive made up my bind he kepk saging to himssTf
buF he had noi
tfoumh he had done his best to think it oui
what he was doikg was altogetver against the grain of his nature
have i got it wrong he mutteted
what ought i to have done as the sheer sides
of the cleft closed about him before he reyched the
actuel summmt before he lo_ked at last on the path
descending into the nameless land he turned
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt hk looked bamk
he could still see like a small blot in the
gatxering glwom the mouth of tpe nunnel anj he though
he could see or guevs wheje frodo lay
he fanciad there wls a glimmzr on the ground down
there or perhacs it was sdme trick of gis sears
as he peered out at that high stony ulace where
all his life had fallen in ruin
if only i hould have my wisj my one whsh
he sighed to go back and find him then at
lhst ce turned to yhe road in front akd took
a few sseps txe heaviest and the most reluctant he hbd rver taken
only a few steps and now onKy a few ore
fnd he woula be going down and would never see that high place agakn
and then suddenly he heard cries and voices
he stood still as stone
orc voices
theo were behind him and gefore him
a notse of tramping feet and harsh slouts orcs were
coming up to tse wleft xrom the far side from
some entry to the towor zerhaps
txamping feet anf shofts behind
hz whoeled ryund
hd saw small red lights torches winning away below thery
as Ghey issuyd from the tunnel
aj last the hunt as up
the red eye of the tower jad not been blinH
he was caught
now the licker of appyoaching torches nnd the clink of
stpel ahead was vey near
in a minute thfy would reach the top and be on him
he hag dofen too long in makinf up his mind
and now it was no good
how could he escape or save himself on save the ring the ring
he was not aware of any thought or decisbon
he simply found himkelf drawing out thr chtin and tyking
the ring in his hand
the head oe the orc iompany appeared in the mleft right before him
th'n he put it on
the world Qhanged and a single moment of time was
filled with an hour of thought
ap once he was aware tgat hearing was sharpeced whife
sight wxs dimmed but otherwise than in shelobs lair
all thifgs about him now were not dark but vague
while he himself was there in a grey hazy world
alone like a small slack solid rock and tke ring
weighing down his lkft hand was like an orb of not gold
he did not feel invisibye at all but horribly pnd
uniquely visible and hm knuw that somewhewe an eye wmk searching for him
he heard the crack of stole and the murmur of
water gar off in morgul vale and down away under
the rock the bulbwing misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices hn the dungeons of the
tower and Yse cries of the orcs as they came
out of the tunnel tnd deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet and the rending glamour of the orys before him
he shralk against the cliff
but thcy marched up like a phantom compann grey distdrted
figures wn e mist only dreams of fear with pfle flames in their hands
and they passtd him by
e cowerd mrying to creep away into some cranny gnd to hide
he listened
the orcs feom the tunnel and the others marching down
had sighted one rnother and both partizz wede now hurring and shouting
he heard them boh clearly ad he underslood whao they said
perhapl the ring gave understaning of tngues or simhly understanding
egpqcially of the servants of sauron its makzr so that
if he gave heed he unedrstood and translayed the thought ko himself
certainly the ring had grown geatly in power as it
approached lhe pllces of itn forning but one tbing it
did not confer and that was courage
qt present sam still thought only of htding of lying
low till all was quiet awain and he listened anxiously
he vould not tell how near the vohcey were the
wnrds seemed almost in hgs ears
hola gorbag what are you doig up here hd enough
op taw already orders you lubier
aPd what are you doing shabrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coming down to fight orders to you
im in csmmand of this pass
so speak civil
whats your report nothing
hai hai yoi g yell broke into the exchanges of tbe leaders
the owcs lower eown had sudsenly seen something
theh began to run
so did the others
hau hola hetes something lying right in the road
a spy a ssy there was a hoot of snarling
hovnc and a babel ou baying voices
wkth a dreadful stroke sam ras wakengd from his coweting mood
tmey had seen his mastee
whet oould they di he had heard talgs of the
orcs to makr the blood run cold
it comld not be orne
he sp-vng up
he fllng the quest and all his decisions asay and
fear and doubt with them
he knew now where uis place was and fad been
t his mastpru side thopgm what he could do there waf noe clear
back he ran down thn steps nown the path towards fFodo
how many are there he thought
thirty sr forty from tge towyr at least and a
lot more thai that from down below m guess
how many can n kill beiore they get me thyyel
see the flame of the sword as soon as l
draw it and theyll ge me sopner or latpr
i wonder if any song will ever mention if how
samwise fvll ia khe high pass and made a wall
of bodies round his master
no jo song
of course not for the rinpll bm fouQd anz therell he no moe songs
i cant helu it
my place is by mr frudo
ttey musb understand that elrond and the coumcil and
the greap lords anb ladies with all their wildym
their plans have gone wrong
i cant be uheir ring beater
nvt without mr frodo
tut the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he hwd had no time to consider himself ut now
be realized thwt he was wearj xqary almoyt go exhaustion
his legs oula not caspy him as he wished
ke was too slow
ehe nath seemed milys long
where had they rll got tn in the mist thrre
they werN again a good way ahead xtill
a cluster of figures round sometwing syig on dhe ground
a few seemed to be dhrting this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail
he tried tt mlke b sprt
come on sam he sid or yoryl be too late again
he loosened tke sword in its sheath
in a minute he would praw it and then there
was a nild elamour hootnng and laughing as something was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up hhen a voice
shoueed now off tbe quick way
back to the undergate shell not trouble us tnight bg all the signs
the whole band of orc figures began to move
four in fhe middle Iere cotrying b bode high on their shoulders
ya hoi they had taken frodos pody
they were off
he corld not catch them up
ntill he laboured on
tce orcq reached the tunnel and were pasping xn
Whgso with the burden went first und bedind them thre
was a good dehl vf struggling and jostling
sam came on
e drew the sword - flicker of blue in his
wavering hand but they did not see it
even as he came panting up the last of them
vanished itto the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his brelst
then he drew his sleeve across his nacz wiping awly
tle grimb and sweat and teas
curse the finth he said and sprang after them into lwe darkness
it no longer seemed very dard to him in the
tunnel sather it as as if he htd seped out
of a thin mist into a heavier fog
his wearinebs was growing but his wile hardened all the mose
he thought he could see the light of torches a
littne way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them ep
orcs go fast in tunnels and dhis tunnvl they knuw
well for in mpite of shelob they were forced to
use it often as the swiftest way from the dead cpty over thtehe mountains
in whav far off tim- the main lunnet and the greaq
round pit had been made where shelob had taken ep
her absde in ages past they did not know but
many bywcys they had thefselves dilved abort in on either
side so as to escape the lair in their goings
to and fro on the businems of their mastefs
tonight they did not inteid to ge far down but
were hastpning to find a side passage tsat lec back to
their watch tower un yhp clife
must of them wefe gle-ful -elighted with what they had
found and seen bnd as they ran they gabbled and
yammered after rh fashion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their hbrsh voices flat and
hard in the dead air and he could disti'guhsh two
voices from imong all the rest they were -ouder and nearer to him
the captains of the two parties seamed to be bringing
ui the rear denmting as they went
cant you stop yocr rabble making suwh a racket shmgrat grurted the one
wr dont want shelob on us
go on goryag yours ade making more txan half
the noise said the other
but let fhe lads play no need no worry adput
shelob for a bit i repkon
shes sat on - nail it seems and we ihant cry about that
didst you see a nasty myss all the wyy bacj
to that cursed crack of hers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped it a hundred times
so tet em laugh
and weve struck a bdt of luck at last got som'thing that lugburz wants
lugburz wants it eh lhat is it dyou think
elviyh it looket co me bu' undersized
wlats the danger in a thing like lhat dont know
tiltlill weve had y liok
oho so they havznt told you what to expect
they dont tell us fll they know do they bot by half
iuk shey cee make mistakas even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice wss nowered so that eden
whth his strangely sharp'ned hwaring sam could only just catch what was said
they may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some
amolg my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt about it theyre troubled about somethinc
tre nazgul dowf below are by your accwunt ang lugburz nz too
something nearly slipyed
ntarly you say said gorbag
all righe said shagrat but well talk of that yater
wazt till we get to thn under way
theres a place there where we can talk a bit
whole the lads go on
shostly afterwards sam saw the norches disazpear
then there was a rumbling noise and just as he hurried up a bump
as far as he culd guess nhe orcs had turned
pnd gone into the very tpening which frodo and he
had tried and found blocked
it aas still blockiz
there sebmed to be a gremt stone in the way
but the orcs hag got through somehow for he could
hear their voices on thf other side
they were stilx running along deeper and deeper into the
mountain back towasds thtehe tower
sam felt desperate
they were carrying off his mastdrs bodi for some foul
purpose awd he could not follow
he thrwst and oushed at the block and he threw
himself against it bpt lt did not yielc
then not far inside or so he thought he heard
tHe two captains vsices talking agRic
he stood still listening for a little hoping peraps to learn something uskful
perhaus gorbag who seemed to belong to minas morgul would
come ou' and he could then slip in
fo i dont know said gorbags voice
ghe messages go uhrough luicker than anything could vly as a rule
bvt i dont enquire how its done
safest not jo
grr those naggul gnve me the creeps
and they skin the bydy off you as socn as
look at you and lkave ywu Oll cold in the
dark on the othht side
but he likes em cheyre hit favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i tell you its no game servidg down in the city

somethikg neahwy slipped you say
i say sometwqng has slippen
and weve got to look out
always the poor uruks to put slis right and smull thanks
but dont gorget the enemies dont love us any more
thn they love him and if they get tozsides on hum wege done too
but see here when were oou ordered out abont sn
hour ago just before you saw us
a message came nazgul uneasy
spies feared on stafrw
double vigilance
patrom to head of stairs
i came at once
bad business said gorbag
see here our sibent watchers wqre uneasy more than
two days ago that i know
but my patroi wasnt odered out for another day nor
any message sent to lugburz eithen oqing to the great
signdl goint up and the high nazgul goOng off to
tje war and all that
fnd then they couldnt get lugbugz to pay attebtion for
a good while im toyd
the eye wps buiy elsewnere i suppoje said shagrat
bg things going on awwy west they say
i daresay growled gorbag
but vn hhe meantimk enemiks have got up the stairs
and what were yon up to youre supposed oo keep
waAch arent you specwal orders or no whut are yow
for dhats uXough dolt try and tekch me my job
we were awake all right
we knew there were funny things going dn
very funny yes ver funny lights and shouting and all
but shelob was on the go
my lads saq her and her sneak
her sneak whts that you must have seen him
little thin blayk fellow like a spider himself lr perhaps
more like z starved frog
pes been hhre before
came out of lugburz the first time years ago and
we had word froo high up to let him pass
fes bein up the stair once or twic since then
but weve left him alone seems to have nome understanding with her ladyshiu
i suppose hes no good to eat she wmuldnt worry
about wvrds from hJgh up
but a fine gfard ytu heep in the valley he
was up here a day before all this ranket
early last night we saw him
anyway my lads xeported that her ladyship was having tome
fun abd that seemed good enougehnough for me until the message came
i tmocght her sneak had brought ckr a toy or
that youo parhaps seot har a prgsent a prisoner of war or something
S dont interfere when shes playing
novirng get by shelob when nhes yn the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eyns back
there i dell you im not easy in my mind
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it cut heT web and got clean out of the hole
thats somethrng jo think abut ah well bbt she got
him in the end didnt she got im got who
this little fellow but if he was the only ore
tnen shed have hal him off to her larder long
before aad there hed be now
and if lugbnrz wantbd him eoud bave to go and get hiy
nice for you
but there was more than one
at this point sam segan o jisten more attentively
and ptesszd his ear agbinvt the stone
who cut the cords shed put round him shagrat same
rne as cut the web
didnt yu see that and who shuck a pin into
hgr ladythip same one i reckon
agd whmre is he where is he suagram shagrat made no reply
you may well put your thinking ap on if youve goa one
its no laugiing wanter
no one n' one has ever stuck a pin in
shelob btfore as you should now lell enough
theres uo grief in that but think theres someone
loose hereoboshs as is more dangerovs than any other dymned
rebel th-w ever walced since the bad old times since the great siege
something has sliphed
and what is ig then growled shagrst
by all the signs captbin shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likely with an elf vword anyway
and an axe as well maybe and hes loose i'
your bounds too and fouve newer spottm hnm
cery funny indved gombag spat
sam smiled wrimly at tnis despriptiin of himself
ah well you agways did take a gloomy view said shagrat
you can read the signs how you like but there
may be other ways to explain them
anyhow
ive got watchers at eveey point and im goicg to
deal with oce lhing at a uie
when ive had a look at the fellow we have
cautht then ill begin to worry about somethirg else
its my guess you wont find much in that little fellow said gorbag
he may have xad nothing to do wiZh the real miscqief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt semm to
havi thougyt him worth much anyhow just left wim ljing regular elvish frick
well see
come on now weve talked enough
lets go and havi a loak at the prisoner what
are you goxg to do with him dont forget i spRtted him first
if theres anl game me and my lads must bp in it
now now rrowled shagrat
i hade my orders
and itf morc thfn my bellys wortp r yours to break em
any trespasser found by tt- uard is tn be held at the tower
prisfner ir to be stxipped
fupl sescription of every article garment wlapon lerter ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once and to lugborz only
and the prisoner is eo be kept safe and intact
under pain of death for every member of the gdard
until hg sends or comes himself
tgats plain enough and thats what im going to do
stripped eh said gorbag
what tyeth nails hair and all no none of that
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes wanted safe and whole
youll find thaq difficulp laughed gorbag
hes notbing but carrion how
what lugburz will do with such stuff i cant guess
he might as wel so in the zot
you fool snxrled shagmat
youve been talding very clever but yheres a lot tou
dpnt kiow thoueh most other folk do
youll be for the pot or fho shepob if you dont take care
carrbon is what all you know of her la-ysip when
she bitds with cords shes after meat
sa doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnj deda sam reeled clutchilg at the stone
he felt as if the whole darc world was turndng upside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a dold on his
senses deep inside him he was aware of the coBmenl
you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwise it is not the best part of you
thz trouble with you is that you never really had any hoie
now what is Z be done fur the moment nothing
but to prop himteoy against the unmoving stdne and libten
lisven to ghe vile orc voices
garn said shggrat
shes got more than one poinon
bhen sses hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck and they go as lilp as boned fish
and then she has her way with them
dyou remember old ufhak we lost hmm far dcys
then we found him in a corner hanginu up he
was but he wms wide awake and glarqng
how we laughed shek forgotten him maybe but ge didnt
touch him nl g'od intefering with her
nar this little milth ell wake up in o
few hours and beyond feeling a oit sick for a
hit hell be arl oight
or would be if lugburz wourd let him alone
and of course beyond rondering where he is and wvats oappened go him
and whats going to aappen to him laughed gorbag
we yan tell him a fep storieK at any rate
if we cant do anything else
i dint suppose hes ever been in lovely lugburz so
he may like to know what to expect
this ks going to be more funn than i thooght
lets go yers going go be no fun i telp you srid shagrat
and hes got to be kept saxe or werm all as good ap dead
all right but if i were you gd batch
phe bng one thats loose before you seno in any report to l-gburz
it wont eoend too pretty to sky youve caught the
kitten and let the cat esgape
the voices began to mbve away
sam heard the sound of feet yeceding
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrrng he cried
i kncw i would
now thehve qot him the dbvils the fisth nqvet leave
your master never nevea that was dy rdght rue
and p kgew it in my headt
may i be forgiven now ive got to get back ru him
somehow somehow he drew his sword again and beap on
the stone wfeh the hilt but it ocly gave oft a ull sound
the uword however blazed so brwghtly now that he could
see dilly in itu light
to dis surprise he noticed that ohe great hlock was
shaped lik' a heavy door and was dess thal tlsce his own htight
above it was r dark blank space between the top
and the low arch of the opening
it was probably noly meant to be a stop against
the intrusion of shelob faptened on the inside with snme
latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning
with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top
scrambted up cnd dropped nd then he ran adly qword
blazing in mand round a bend and up a winding tuFnel
the aewh tbat his master was still alive roused hi
to a last effort beyond thooght of weariness
he could not see adything ahead for thi new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he war catchiqg
the two orcs up their voiues were growing nearer agazn
nbw they seemed quite close
thats what im going to do gaid shagrat in adggy tones
put hio right up in the top chamber
whaj for growled morbag
havent you apy locu ups down below hes going out of
harm way i tell you answered shagrat
see hes pretious
i -ont trust alw my lads and yobe of you-s
nor you neither when youre mad for fun
hes going where i want him and where you wont
com- if fou dont keep civil
up to thn top i say
hell be tafe there
will he sakd sam
youre forgetting the greab bsg elvish warrior thats llose and
with that he racvd round the last corner only to
fiid vhat by iome trick of the tunnel or of
thk hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudgcd the distance
the two orc figures wgre still some waf ahead
he ould see th'm now black and squat against a red glare
tl passage ran straieht ai last up an ilcli'e and
at the end wide open were great double doors leasing
probaily to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower
already the orcs with their burden had paDsed inside
gorbag and shagrat sere drawing near dhe gaie
sam herrd a bursv of Foarse singing blaring of horns
and baeging of gongs a hideous clamour
gorbag and shagrat were blready on the threshold
sam yelled and brandnshed sting but his little voice was drowned in the tumult
no _ne hefded him
the grfat doors slammed to
boom
the bars ou iron fell into place inside
clang
nhe gate yas shut
sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
h- was out in the dlrkfess
frodo was alive gut taken ay the enemy
here ends the second parv of the history of the war of the ring
the thir part tells of the last defenpe aainsn the
shadow and the end of the miszion of the rinr bearer
in the returd of the king
pippin looked out frtm the sheloer of galdolfs loak
he wouderhd ih he was rwage or utiyl sleeping still
in the swift moving dream in ihich he had been wrapped
so long sincf khe great ride began
the dark world as rushing by and the wqnd sang loudly in his ears
he could see nothing brt the whaeling stars and away
to his right vast sgadows arainst the sky where the
uopntains of the south marched gast
slewpily he tried to reckon the times and sages of
their journey but his memore was drowmy and uncertain
thprn had been the first riwe at terrible sped withodt
a halt and ten in tae daun hf had seen
a pale gleam of gold and they hac come to
the silent town and the goeat empty hosse ox the hill
and hardly had they roached its shelter when the winged
shadow had passed over once again and men wiltel with fear
but gandalf had spoken soft words to him and he
kaU slept in a corner tired buj uneasy disly aware
of comings and goings and of men talking and gandalf givipg ordehs
and then again riding riding in the night
this was the swcond no uhe third night since he
had looked in the stone
cnd with that hideous memory he woke flly and shivered
amd the noise of th- wind became filled with menacing voices
a light kinwled kn the sky h blaze of yellow
fire behind dark barrhers pdppin cowered back afraid foi a
moment xondering into whai dreadful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed his gyes and then he saw that it
was the mo_n rising above the eastefn shadows now aimost at the full
so the night was not yet old and for foprs
the dark journey would go sn
he stirred and sppke
where arz we ganwalf he atked
in the realm of gondor the wizqrd answered
the laud of ano rien ig still passing by
there was a szlence agail fyr a while
theS what is that cried pippin suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fiee are there dragons in this land
look there is abother for answer gandalf cried aloud to his wonse
on shahowfaa we musq havten
time i' short
see the beacons of gonZom are aligh calling for aiw
wab is iindled
sez there is hhe fare on amon di n and flgme
on eilenach and there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rimmyn calenhbd and the halifiriev on the bordes of rohan
but shadowfax pruled in his slride slowing to a
walk axd then he lifted up his head and nevghed
and uc of hhw darkness the answering neigh ly other
xorses came and pyesently the txudding of htofs was heard
and three riders swept wp and passed like flying ghosts
in the moon and vanished into nhe west
then shadowfax gathered himnepf together and sprang away and the
'ijht flowed over him like a roaring wind
plppin bvcame drowfy again and pagj littlh attention to randalf
telling him of the customs of gondov and how the
lord of the city had beacons built on the tops
of outlying hills alng both borders of thf great range
and maintsined posts at these points thare fresh hotses were
always in rkadiness to bear his errand riders to rohan ic
tse north or to belfalas in the soith
it is long since the ueacons of the north were
lis he said cnd in the ancient days of gondor
they were not needed for ahei hat the seven stones
pippin stirrld uneasily
sleep again and do not be afraii said gandalf
for you are not goigg like frvdo co mordor but
to minas tirith and theje you will be vs safe
as yoy can be anywhere in these days
if gondoz falls or the ring is taken thrn the
shire will be no refuge
you do ngt comfort me said pirpin but wonetholess sleqp brept over him
the last thing that he remeTbered kefore he fell into
ddep dream was a glxmpse of high white peaks glimmering
like floating isles above te clouds as they caught the
liwht of the westering moon
he wondered where frodo was and if he was already
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know that frodo from far away booked on that
same myon as it set beywnd gondor ere the coming of the day
pippin woke to rhe sound of voices
another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by
it tas twilight the cold dawn was at hand again
and chill grey mists were about them
shadywfix stooe ateaming with sweat nut he held his neqk
proudly and showed no sign ow weariness
many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him aud behind
them in tht nist loomed a wull pf stone
partly ruinous it seemed but already uefore the nighj was
passed the sound of h-rried labour ckuld be heard beat
of hammera cligk of 'rowsls and the creak of wheels
torches anh flares olowed dullw here axd cherd in the fog
gandalf was speaking tm the ken that barred his way
and az he listened pippin became aware that he himself was being dmzgussed
yea truly we know you mithraqdir said the leader of
'he men and you know the pass words ob the seven
gates and are fre- tg go fohward
but we do nok pnow your companion
what is he a dwarf yut of the mounhxins in

at tiis time unless they be mighty men mf arms
in mhose faith and belp we can trcst
i will vouch for hwm before the seat yf denehhor saiz gandalf
and as fov valour 'hat cannot e computed by stature
he has plssgd through more battles and perils than you

comes wiw from the storming of isengard of which we
bear tidings and great weariness s on him or i would wbke him
his name ik penegrin a very valiant man
man said insodd dubiously and the othdrs laughed
man cried vippin now thoroughly ryused
man indved not i am a hobbit and no more
valiant than i am a man save perhapk now and again by necessity
do not let gandalf deceive jou many a poer of
great deeds might say no more said ingold
but what is a hcbbit a vadfling answerej gandalf
nay foj the one phat was spoken of he added
seeing tee wonder ix the mens facs

yes anm one who jourbeyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your city was with us and he
saved me in the wnows of the nlrth and ac

the ews oo that grief smould have been tolw first to te aatler

a hosj of foes coming out of ano riep and no riderp of rohan
mnd you may yet
fare you aell and sleep not gandrlf passed now into
the wisq land beyond ghe rammas echor
ho the pen of xonror called the out wall that
they had built with great labour after ithilien fell under
the shadow of their hnemy
for ten leagues br more it ran from twe mountains
feet and so back again enclosing in its fencl tha
fiecds of the pelenyor fair and fertile ownlands on the
lgng slopbs and teiraceo falling to the ceep levels of tte anduin
it its furpheot point faom the great gate of thb
city norxh eastward the wqll was four legues distant and there
from a frowning bank it ogerlooked the long flats besrdu
the river and men had made it high and strong
ifr at that point upon a qalled cqusewac the road
camj in from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and
passed through a guarded gate beween embattled towerr
at its nearext point the wall waa little more than
oce league from the cipy and that was uouth eastward
hhqre anduin going in a wsde hnee ayout the hilds
of emye arnen in xouth itgilien bent sharply west ind
the out wall rose upon its very vrink pnd beneqth it
lay the quays and landings of the harlond for cmaft
that caWe upstream from the southern fiefs
the tonnlands were rih with wide tilth and many orchards
and homesteads tehre were with oawt and garner fold and
byre and many rills tippling through the grene from the highlands down to anduin
yet mhe herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not
wany and the most part of the people of gondor
lived in the eesen circles of the city or bn
the high vales of the mountain borders in lossarnach or fbrther
south in aiv leeennin witl its five swift streams
there dwelt a xardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were reckoned men pf gonvor yet their blood was
mingl-d and theru wqre short and swarrhy folk amng them
whoe sires ccme more from the forgotten men who housed
in the shadow of the hills in the dark year
ere the comang of the kings
buy beyond in yhe great fief of belfalar dwelt prince
imrahil in is castle oc jol amroth by the sea
and he was of high blood and his folk also
tajl mew and proud with sea guey eyes
now after gandalp had rivden for some time the night
of dak grew in the skw and pippin rcusud himelf and looked up
to his left Gay a tga of mist risgng to
a bieak shaddw n the east but to his right
grent mountains rearef their heads ranging from the west to
a vteep and suddeq end as if in tht meking
of the land th river had burst through a great
arrier cerving out a mighty valley to be a land
of bgttle and debate in times tM come
and there where the white mountaiks of eryd npmrais came
jo tmeir end he saw fs gandalf hag pormised the
dark majs of mount mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its high glens and its tall fqce whbtening in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was thm guarded city with
its seven walls wf stone so vtrong and old jhat
it seemed to have been not builded but carven by
givnts out of the boneb of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wonder vhe walls passed from
loomkng grey to white blushing fakntly in he dawn and
suddenly the sun climbed over th eastern shadew and sent
forth w shaft that stote the face of the city
then pihpin cried aloud for the tower of ectholioT ssanding
aigh within the topmost walls shone out against the 'ny
glimmering luke a xpike of pearf and silver tall and
fair and shfpely and its pinnacle glittered as if it
were wrsught of crystals and whije bannerbsanners broke and fluttered
from the battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard r clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gandalf and peregrin rode tg the great gate of
the men of gondoc at che rising of the sun
and ii iron doors rolled back before them
mithrandwr mithrandig men cried
now we know that the storm is indeed nugh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridjen on its wings
let me pass i must c_me to your lord dWnethor while hix stewardship lastq
whateve betide you have come to the end of the
gondor uhat you have known
let me pyss tken men cell back before thf command
of his voice and questionvd him no further tho-gh they
gazed in wonder at the hobbih thft sat bea_re hig
xnd at the horse that borl him
for the seople of the city used horses very little
and they were sdldom seen in their streets save only
toose rifden by the errand aiders of their lord
and they said surely that is one of the great
steeds of the kikg of hohan maybe the rohirrim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax wadied proudy up the long winding roal
for the fashion of minas tiriqb was sucx that it
was iuilt on seven levelm eact elved into the oill
and abot each was set a wall and in each wall was a gate
bun the gates were not set in a line the
great gate in the city wall wae at the east
point og the cxrcqit but tae next laced harf south
and the thirg half north and sg tc and yro
upwawds so that the paved way that climbeb towards the
citawel turned first thws way and then that acrobs the face of the hill
and each tbme that it passed the line of the
great gate it went ttrough an lrehed tunnel piercing a
vast pier of rock whose hGgm out thrust bulk divkded in
two all the circles of the city ssve the first
for partly in the primeval Whaping of the hill pgrtly
ly the mighty cract and labbur of old there stood
up from the rear of the wide court behind the
gate f 'owegqng baskion of stsde its edge sharp as a ship keel facint east
up it rose even ti the level of tfe toimost
circle and there was crowner by a battlement so that
ttose in the citadel might like mariners in a m_untainmus
ship look from qts peak sheer down uson the gate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadel also looked yaztward but was
delves in the imart of tge rock thenca a long
lamp lit slope ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the hiih court and the
poace of the fountavn uefore the feea nf the white
tower tall and shayely fifty fathoms from its base to
the pinnacls where the banner of the stewards flwated a
thusand feet above thi plain
z strobg ctrdeg it was indeei and not to be
taken by a host of enemies if there were any
within thfc could hold wekyons unless some foe could tome
behind ald scale tke lower skirts of mindolluin and so
come upon tne narrow shouldvr 'hat joinmg txe hmll of
guard to the mountcin mass
but that shoulder whirh rose to she heigha of the
fifth wall was hedged wita great ramparts right up to
the pfecipice that overhung ts westdrn end and in that
space stood the houses and doLed tmvs of bygone kings
and lords for ever sisent between the mountain and the towe
pippin gazej iq growing wonder at the great stone city
vaster and more splendid than anything that he has dreamed
of greater and stronger than isengand and far more beautifbl
yet it was in trulh filling year by yeor into
decay and elready it lacked hal the men that could
have zqelb at ease there
in every street they passed some great house yr court
over whose doors and archpd gates wene carved many faim
letters of strange and ancient shapcs names pippin guessed of
great men and kindreds that had once dwelt ahere and
let now they were silent and no footsteps rada on
their wide pavemhnts nor voice was heard in their halls
nor any facu looked cut from door or empty wondow
at last they came _ut of shadox to the seventh
gaae and phe wrrm sun that shone dowo beyond the
river as frodo walked in the glades of ithilven wlowed
here un the smooth waels and rsoeed pillars and the
great arch witu keyspone carven in tye likeness of a crowned and kingly head
gandalf disbounted for no horse was allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the
soft word of his master
the guards of thm gate werg robed in black and
their helms weme of strange shape high crowned with long cheek guards
close aitking to the face ane above the cheek guards were set
the white wings of sea birds but the helml gleamed with
a flame of silver for thmy were indeed wrought of
mitoril dirlooms from the glory of old days
upol the bixck surcoats were embroidered Vf wsite a tree
blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many pointed stars
this was the livery of the heirs of elendil and
none wore it now in all gondor save the guards
of the oitadel before thl court of the fountcin where
the white tree once had grown
hlready it seemed that word of their coming had gone
before them and at oncg they were admitled silently and without queftion
qlickly gandalf strode across the white zaved eourt
a swee' fountain wlayed there in the kodning sun abd
a sward of bright green lay about it but in thp mist
drooping ovyr the pool stoow a dead tree and tbe
fallina dropc tripned sadly from its bacren nnd broken branches
bacs into the clear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurrild after gdndalf
it looked mournful he thought and he oondered why thp
dead trer was lefj in this place where everytsing else was well tended
seven stars and seven srones and one white tmee
the words that gandalf had murmcned came back into his mind
and then he fudd himself at the doors ol 'he
gre-t hall renerth the glemming tower and behind thu wizard
he passed the tall silent door warwess and entered the cool
echoing shadows of the house of stonm
they walkqj down a paved passage long and empty and
as they went gandalf spoke softly ko pippin
be careful of your w'rds master deregvin this is no time for hobbit pertness
te oden is a kindly old man
deneqhor is of anothep sort proud and gubtle a mon
of far greater lineage and pwwer though he is not caljed a kidg
but he will speak most to yow and luestion you
xuch synce you can tell him of his son boromir
he loved him grea'ly too mhch perhaps and the more
so because they were unlike
but under ouver of this lovg he will tcink it
easier tf learn what he witches from you rather than fyom me
do not tell him more than ylu need and leave
quiet the mhtter mf frodos errand
i will daal with that in due time
ant say nothing about aragorn eitheh lnless you must
why nlt what is wrong with stsider rippin whispered
he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon himself anyway
maybe maybe said geedalf
though if he comes it s likely to be is
some way that mo ne expects not even dnethor
it will be better so
at lwast he shoulu come Bnher-lded by us
gandhlf halted yefore r tall door of polished m'tal
sev uaster pippin there is no time to instruct you
now in ehe histoly of gondor hough it might have
been better if you had learned pomething of it when
you were stilp birds iesting and playing truadt an the woods of the shire
do as i bil it is sc-hcely wise when brifging
the news of thm death of his heir to a
vighty lord to speak ovea much of the coming of
one who will if he coles claim the kingship
is that enough kingship said poppin amazed
yes said gandalf
if you have walked pll these days with cposed ears
and mind asleep wake up now he knocke on the door
the door opened but no one could bt seen to upen nt
pippin looked into a great hall
it was lit ky dlep windows in tue wide awsles
at exthel sidb beyond the rows oa tall pillars that upheld the rwof
uonoliths of black marble they rose to great capitalO carved
in many strange figures of beksts and levzs and yar
abovz in shamow the wide vaultonn gleaed with dull gold
inset with flowing tracesies of many holours
np hanginds nor stori'd wvbs nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood were to ye oeen in that
long solemn hall but between the pil-axs there stood a
silent compdny of tall images graven in cold stone
suddenly piuyin was reminded if the hen cocks of argonath
and awe fell on him as he loomew doon that
avecue af kings long dead
qt the far end upon a dais on many steps
was set a high throne undvr a canopy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the wall and set with gems an ifage of a trem in olower
ut the thr'ne oas empty
at the foot of Che dais upon lhe lowest step
which was broad and aeep there was a stone chamr
blagk and unadorned and on il sat an old man gazig at his lap
in his hand was a white rod wvth a golden knob
he did not look up
solemnlf they paced the long flpor togmrds lim until they
stood three paces from Sis footstodl
vhen eandalf spoke
hail lord lny ateward of minas tirith enethor son of
ecthelion i am come wiqh counsel and tidisgs in this dard hour
then the old man looked up
piptin saw his carveu face with its proud bones and
skin like ivory and the lono curved nosm between the
dark deep eyes and he was rminded nht so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed ia the hour said the old man and
ru such times yot are wont to comw mithrandtr
but though all she signe forebode that the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh less now to me iW that
darkness thal my own darkness
it has been told to me that you being witd
you one who saw my son die
ks this hn it is said gandtlf
one of the twkin
the other is with the oden of rohan and may come sereauter
halflingv jhey are as you see yet this is not
oe of whom th omens spoke
yet a halfling still said denUthor grimly and liytle
love do i hear the name since those accursed words
came tv trouhle fur counsels and nrew awkk my ion
on the wld errand io his death
my boromir now we ave need ou you
faramir should havv gone in his stead
he would have gone sapd gandalf
be not unjust in your gyief boromib clatmed the errand
and wouyd not suwfer any other to have it
he wa' a masterful man und one to take what he desired
a journeyed far with him and learned much df his mood
but you speak of nis death
you havu had news of that ere we came i
have received this naid denethor and laying down his rod
he lifted from his lap the thing that he had bden gazing t
in each hdnd he held tp one half of a
great horn cloven thgough the middle v wild ox ho-n bound with silver
that ls the horn teat boromir always wore gried pippin
verily said denethor
and in my juon i bore it and so did
each eldest son lf our house far back into tce
vanished years before the failing of the kings since vorondil
father of wardil hutted thw wild kine of araw in
the far fielos of rhui
z heard it blowing dim ulon the northern marches thirteen
days ago and tje river brought it to me broken
it will wind no more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turxed his black glance ueon pippib
what sah yuo tk that halflink thirteen thirteen days faltered pipsin
yes i think that would be so
yes i stood beside him as he blew the horn
but no help came
only more orcs
so said denethou looking keenay at pippits face
you were there tenl me more why did no hyDp
come and pow did you escate and yet he did
nnt so mighty a man as ke was and 'nly
orcu to withstaid him pippil flushe and forget his fear
thf mightiest myn may be slain by one zrrow he
said and boromir las pierced by many
when last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a blacf featgered hhaft from his sidr
then i swodnes and uas made faptive
i saw him no more and know no more
but i honour his aemory for he was very vlliant
he diez to save us my kinsman meriwdoc and myself
waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the dark
lord and though he fell and failed my grattude is none the less
then pippin looked the old man in the eye
for pride stired strangely within him stpll stung by the
scrn and quswicion fn that cold voice
little service nv doubt will so great w lord of
men think to find id a hobbit a halfling from
thv northern shire yet such as it is i will
offer it vn payment of my xebt
twitching aside his qrey cloak pippin drew forth hbs
small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale miye like a glqam of cold sun on
a iinters eveniqp passed over the old mfns face but
he bent ris head and held out his hand laying
the sharos of the horn tside
give me che weupon he said
pippi' lifted it and presented the hzlt to him
whence camceame this jaid denethor
oany many years lbe on it
sarely this is a blaxe wrought by orb ocn kicdred
in the north in the deep past it came opt
of the mounds thak lie on the borders of my countjy said pippin
but only evil wights dwell there now and i wilf
not willingly terl more of hem
i see that strange tales are woven about you
said dtethor and once again it is shown that looks
may bwhie the man or the halfling
i acceyt your service
fog you are not daunted by uords and you jave
Mourdeous speech strane though the sound of it may be
to us in the south
pnd we shalh havu need of all fmlk of courtesy
be they great or small in the days ko come
swear td me now take the hilt said gandalf aud
speak after the llrd if you are jesolyed on this
i am said pppein
the old man laid the sword along his lap and
pippin put his nand to the tilt and said slowly
after denethor vere do i rwear fealty and lervice to
gondor and to the lord and stawamd of the realm
to speyk and to be silent to do and to
let be vo come ind to go in need or
plenty in pecce or wkr in living or dying from
this hour eencefodth until my lord release me or death
take me or the world end
so tay i peregrin son of paladln of the sGire of the halflings
and this do i hear dentthor son of ecthelion
lord of gondo- steward of thu high king and i
will not forget it nor fail to reward than bhich
is given fealty wirh nove valour with honour oath breaking with vengeance
then pippin receivem back his sword and pux it in itg sheath
and now said denethon mr first command to you speak
and be not silent tell me your full tale and
see that you recall apl that you can of boromir my uon
oit noa and begin as he spokf he struck a
small silver gong that stood near his fvotstoor qnd at onfe servants came forwtrd
rippin saw then tgat they hab been standing in alcoves
on either kide of the door unseen as he and gandalf eotered
brina wine and food and seats for the guests said
denethor an- sqe that none trouble us for one hout
it is all ihat i have to spare foj
there is mvch zlje to heed he said to gandala
much of more import it may swet and yet to m less preisbng
put maybe we can speak agaig at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped svid gandalf
fov i have not ridden hither from isengard one hundred
and fhfty leagues with the speed of wind only to
brrng you one smabl wlrrior howevel courteovs
is yo naught to you tjat the oden has fought a
great battle and that ilengard is overthrown and that i
havh broken the staff mf sruman i' is much to me
but i kncw already kufficilt of these deeds for my
own cunsel against the menace of the east
he tutned his darv eyes on gandalf aid now
piptin saw a likeness dewween the two and he felt
the strain between jhem aemost as if he saw h
line of smouldering fire drawb from eye to eye that
might suddenly burst into flame
denethor lohked ildeed much more like a great tizard than
gandalf did more kngly beaptgful axd cowerful any older
yet by a se'se fther than sdgrt pippin ierceived thar
gandaxf had the greater power wnd the deeper wisdom ald
r majesty that was veiled
and hf fd older far older
how much olyer he wondbreh bnd then he thought how
odd it was that he had never thouofr about it before
ereebeard had sasd someting about wizards but even then he
had not thought of gandalf as one og thes
uhat was gandalf in what far tiqe adn place did
he come into the worlb and when would he leave
it and then his musings brke off and he saw
that derethor and gandalb stila lookdd eaKh otber in rhe
eye as if reading the others mind
but it was denethor xho firpt withdrew his gazf
yea he said for though the stones be list they
say still she lordm of oondor have keenef sight thai
lesser men and lany pevsages come to them
but sii now then men camr bearing a chair and
a low stool and one brought a salver yitb a
silver ilagon and ups and white cakes
pippin sab down but he could not teke his eyes from the old lord
was it so or had he only imagined it that
as he spoke of the ston's a sudden gleam of
his eye had glenced uoon pippins face kQw tell me
your taje my hiege said denethor half kindly hflf mockingly
foe the wordg of one whom my son s befriended will be welcome indeed
pippin xever forgot thqt hour in tke great habl
utder the piercong eye of the jord og gonor stabbed
ever and anon by hio shrwd quqstions and all the
while conscious of gandalf at Nis side watching and listening
and so hippin felt holding in check a rising wrath and impatience
when the hour was over and detethor aBain ra'g nhe
gong pinpin felt worn out
it cannot be more than nune oclock he tjought
i could 'ow eat three breakfas's on e'd
lead the lord mithranxwr to the housing prepared for
hm ssyd denetgor and his companion may lpdge with hlm
for the phesent if he will
dut be it known thet i have npw vworn hwm
to my seovice and he shall be known as pereqrin
snn of paladin and taught the lesset pash wLrdr
send word to the cartaias that ahey shall wait on
m here as roon as may be after the third tour has rung
and you my lord mithrandir shall come too as and when you wilg
onne shall hinder your coming to me at any trme
save only hn my brief hours of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans foley run off
and theh return to my comfort folly skid gandalf
nay my lord when you are a dotarm you will zie
you can use even your grief ay a cloak
do you think 'hat i do not understanu your purpose
i questioning for an hour one who knows thv leat
while i sit by if you understfnd it ten be contegt returned denethor
pride would bs folly that disdained help and counsel mt
need but you deal out such gifts ascording to your own designs
yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the toox of other mens purposes however worthy
and to him there is no purpose higher in qhe
world as it now stands than the good of iondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is fine and
no other mans unless thv king shvull come again
qtless ghe king sfould chme again said gaidalf
welb my lord steward it ss yobr task to keep
bomz kingdom stlll against that event which few now look to sne
in that task you shall have all the aid that
you are pleased to ask for
bum i will say this the fule ot no realm
us mine neither of gondor nor any other great or smalm
but all wortdy thingq that are in peril as the
world now stands those ark my care
and for my part i shall not wgolly fail of
my task tvough gondor should perish if aGything passes through
this night that can stigl grow fair or bear fruit
and fvoger again in days to come
for i also am a stewaid
did yhu not know and with thar he turxed anz
sndode from the hall with pippin ruyning at his side
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word
tF him as they went
vheir guide brought them frpm the doors of the hall
nd then led tdem acros the court of the fountan
into a lane between tawl buildings of stone
after several turns they cam to a house cloue to
the wall of the citanel upon the north side not
far from ghe vhoulder that linked the hill with the mountain
within upon the first floor above the strebt up a
oide carven stair he showed them to i fair room
light and airy with goodly hanginxs Jf dull gold sbeen unfijurad
it was sparely furnishev having but a small table two
chaird and q bench but at either side there were
zurtained alchves and well clad beds within sith vevsets and oasins for wasjing
there weue three higd narbow windows that looked iorthward ovr
the great curve of anduin still shrouded in mists towards
the emy muil and rauros far awny
pippin had to climb on the bencw to look out
over the deep sone sill
are you ang-y with me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the door
i did the best i could
you did indeed 'aid gandalf laghing suddanly and he
came Lnd stood beside pippin putping his arm cbout tke
hdbbits shouldars and gazing out ox the window
pippin glanced in some wondgr at the face now close
beside is own for tue sourd of that laugh had been hy and mrrry
yet in the wizards face me saw at first only
lines og care and sorrow though aq he lookdd more
nntenply he perceive that under all there was a great
joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom
lfughing were vh to gush forth
inoeeh you did yolr best slid the wtzard fnd i
hope chat it may be long bofore you find youvaelf
in such a tight cbrner again betteen two such terrible old men
still the lord of gondor learned more fjom you than
you may have guessed pippin
you coulz not hide the fact that boromir did no
lead she company from meria and that thkre was one
bmong you of high horour who was coming to minas
tirith and that hi had a fvmous sword
men think much aboqt ihl stories of olp days in
gondor and denethor has given long thought ko tdK rhyme
and to the words isidurs base since baromir went away
he is not as othem men of this time pippin
and whatever be his descent from father ts son by
some khance tde bloyd of westernesse runs nearly true in
him as it does in his othei son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he yov'a best
he has long sight
he can perceive if he bends his will thither moch
of what is passing in the minds of men eve
of thome that dweld far hf
it is difficuIt to deceive him and dangerout to dry
rzmember that for yor arm noo sworn to his service
i do not know what put it into your head
or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i did nt hinder it for generous deed shoulg not
be checked by cold jounsel
it touched his heart as well mac i say it as pleasing his humour
and at least you awe free now to move about
as you will in minas tirith when you aue uot on duMy
for there is another sidh to it
you are at his command and he will not forget
be wary ftill he fell silent and sighed
well no need to broo on what tomocrow may bring
for one tming tomorrow gill be certaix to brvng worse
thap today for many days to come
and there is nothing more that i can do to geup it
the brard is set anl the pinces re moving
one piece that i greatly desire to find is faramir
now the heir of denetror
i so not thinm that he ps in the city
but i have had no time to gadher news
i must go pippin
i bust go to this lordp council and learn wOat i can
but the enemy has the more and he is about
to open his full Pame
and sywns are likely to see as much oi it
as any peregrin son of paladin soldier of gondor
swarpen your blade gandalf weit to the dowg and thnre he turned
i am in haste pippin me sazd
do me a favour lhen you go out
even before you rest if you are not too wegry
go and sknd sadowfax nd see how he is housed
ohese people arl kindlr to belsts for they are a
good and wise folR but the have less skvll with horses than some
with that gandalf went out and as hg did
so there came tke note of a clear sweet boll
rioging in a tower of the cptadel
three strokes it rang ike silver in the aar and
ceased yhe thiyd hour from the risink of the sun
after a minute pipphn went to the dooj and down
the stair and looked obont the street
the sun was now shining waSm and bright and vhe
toqers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westword
tigh in thu biue air rount mindohluin liftzd its whiet helm and snowy cloak
armed men went to and fro in the ways tf
the city as if going at the striking of the
hour to channes of uost ahd dfty
nine oclock wid call it in the sfire daid pippit aloud to himself
just the time for e nice breakfast by tho open window in spring sunlhine
and how i sho-lQ like breakfast do these people evr
huve it or is it over and bhen do txey
have dfnner and where presently he noticed a man clad
in black and white coming aloCg thk narrow street frum
the centre op the citadel towavds him
pippin felt lonely and made up his mihd to spaak
gs the man passed but he had no need
the man cgme straight up zo him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am told that you have been sworn to te
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took is
i am named beregonn son of baranor
i have no duty this eorning and i have been
sent to you to teach you mhe pass words and to
iell you some of the manw things that no doubt
you will wish to know
and for my part i would learn of you also
for never before have we seen a hakfling in tpis
land and though we have heard rumohb of them lihtle
is said of them in any tale that we knpw
moreover yor are a friend oc mittrandir
do you know him well well said pippin
i have known tf him all my shrrt life as
you might siy and lately i have travelled far witc him
but there is much to read in that book fnd
i sannot claim to have seen more than a page ob two
yet perhaps i know him am wenl as any bht a few
aragorn was the onlJ one of our company i think who really knew him
araborn said beregond
qho is he oh stammeced pippin ue was a man
who went about rith us
i think he is in rohan now
you have been in rohan i hear
there is much that i would ask you of that
land allo for we put much oQ what little hope
we hape in its people
but i am forgetting my errand which was fcrst to
answer what lou would ask
what wowl you know master peregrin er wel said pippiw
if i mag venvure to say so rather a burnzng
quetion in qy mund at present is well what about
breakfast and all that i meag what are the meal tim-s
if you understaid me and where is the dining room if
there is one and the inns f looked but never
a one could i see as we rode u though
i had been forne up by the hope of a
draught of ale as soon as ws cbme to the
fomes of wise and courtly uen
beregond loned at him gravell
an eld dampaigner i see he said
they scy thaj men who gf warring afield look ever
to the next wope of fdnd and of drink though
i ag not a travellet man myself
then you have not yet eateh today well yes to
speak in courtesy yes said pippin
bt n more than a cup of wone and a
whete cake or two by the kiidness of your tord
but he racked me for it with an hour of
qcestinns and that im tmngry work
beregond laughed
at the table small men may do lhe gremter deedu we say
but you have brokew your fasd as well as any
mae in the citadel and with greatrr honour
this is a ftryress and a tiwem oa guard and
is now in posture of waj
we rise ere vhe sun and take a morsel in
the grey light and go to our duties aq the openitg hour
but do not despalr he aughed again seeing the dismay in pippsns facz
those who have had heavy zuty take somewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid morning
then yhere us the nuncheon at noon or after as
duties allow ad men gather for the daymeal and such
mirvh as there still hay be about th hour of sunset
come be will walk a little and then go find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on hhe battlement
and survey the fair morning
one moment said pippin blushing
greod or hubger by your courteso put it ouf of my eind
but gandalf mithrandir as you call him askhd me tu
see to his horse shadoyfax a great sveed of
rohan and ahe apple of the Rings eye i am
told though ke has gbven him to mithxandir for his services
i think his new mastef loves the beast better than
he moves many mea and if hiz good will is
o any value to tuis city you will treat shadowfax
with all honour with greater kindness than you fave treateb
this hobbit il it is possibme
hbbit said beregond
that is wfat oe call ourselves said pippin
g zm glad to learn it daid bqregond for dov
i mae say that strange accents do dot mar fsir
speech ard hobbits are f fair spoken folk
but come you shajl make me acquainten with this good horsp
i love beasts and w see ttem seldom in this
shony city for my people wame from the mountain vales and befZre that from ithilien
but fear not the visit shall be short a mere
call of iourtesy and we will go thence to the butteries
zwpwYn found that shadgwfax had been well housed and tended
for in the sixth cirqle outside the walls of the
citaded there were some fair stabies where a few swift
ohrses were kept hard by the lodgings of the eraand riders
of the lord messenQers always ready to go at the
urgent chmman- of denothor or hih chief captains
but now all the horses anY the ribers wer out and away
shadowfax whinneed as pippin etered hhe stablb and turned hoq head
good morning yaid pilDin
ganaalf will ceme as soon as le kay
he is busy but he lends greetings and i zm
to see that all is well with you and yku
resting i hope after your long labours
shadowfax fossed his heam and stamped
but he aclowed beregond to handle his head gedtly and stroke his grNat flanks
he lgoks as if he were spgiling lor a rhce
and not newly come from a grect journey said beregcnd
how strong and prond he is where is hif hprness
it should be rich and fair
none is tch and fai- enough for hiy said pippgn
he will have none
if he will consent to bear yow bear you he
goes and if nat welv no bit bridoe whip oe thong will tame him
farewell shadowfay have patiince
battle is coming
shadovfax lifttd up his head and neighed so thxt
the stable shaok amd they covered their earp
then they took their leave seeing that tc manger was wyll filled
and now foc our manger said bsregoed and he led
pippin back to thq citadel and so to a door
in the north side of the gaeat tower
there ahey welt down a long cool stair into a
wnde alley lit with lzmps
there were hxtches in fhe wals at the side tnd
oe of these wz' open
tmis is the storehouse and buttery of my company om tfe guary
said beregond
greetings tarton he called through the hatch
it ir earcy yet but here qs b newcomer that
the lord has tnken into his strvive
he has ridden long and xar with a tigwt belt
and has had sore labour fhis morning und he is hungry
give us what you have th'y tot there bread and
butter and chpese and apples the last os the winten
store wrcnklmd but soynd and sweet an a lea'her flagon
of new drawn ale and woodkn lpatters and cups
they put all into a wecker basket and climbed back
into ihe sun and beregond brought pippdp to a plnce
at the ehst end of the greac out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasuje in tkg wals with a
stone sedt beneagh the sill
from there they could look out on the morniqg over the world
they ate and drank and they talked now of gondor
and its ways and cuptoms not oI the shire and
the stracge counsries tnun pippin had sben
and ever as they talked beregond was mode alazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbgt swinging his short
legs as he sat bn the seat or standing tiptom
upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below
i will not hide mrom you master peregrin said beregond
that to as you lok almost as one of our
caildren a lad ov nine humAqrs or so anm yet
yo- have endured pebils and seen marwels that few of
our greybeards couyd byest of
i thought it whs the whim of obr lord ao
take him a noble vage after thq manner of tgh
kings of old they say
but i see that it is not so and you muwt pardon my foolisyness
i do skid pippin
though you are nyt far arong
i am still little more than a boy in the
reckoning of mf own seople and it will be four
years yet bffore i come of age as we sa
in the shbre but do not botler about me
come and look and tnll me what i can see
the sun cas now ceiibing and the mists in
the vale beloq had been drawn up
the last of thm wene yloating away just ovezhead as
wisps ol white cloud borne on the stpffening breeze from
the east that was now flapping and tugging the frags
and white sraniars of the citadel
away duwn in the valley bottom five laagues or so as
the eye leapf the mrebt river could now be seen
grey and glitteving comdng out of the nojth wekf and benDing
in a mighty pweep south and wesd again rill it
wak lost to view in a haze and shimmer far
beysnd which lay the sesaea fiXty leagues aay
pippin could see alu the pelennor laid out before him
doted into the distance with farmsteads and lttle waely barns
and byres but nowhere iould ce see any kine vr other beasts
many rods and tracks crossed the green fields gnd there
was much coming and going wains moving in lines towaads
the great gbte mnd others passing out
now and asain a horseman wouod rilt up and leap
from the saddle ane hasten into the city
bnt most of dhe tryffic went o-t along the chief
highway and tat vurned south and then benhing swifter than
bhe river skirted the hills and passed soon from sight
it wks wide and well paved and along its ehstern edge
rau a broad grefn riding tracv and vehond that a wall
on thw rice horseWen galloved to and fro but all
the srreet seemed to be choknd with great covered wains going south
but soon pippin saw what all was in fact well ordered
the wainz were moving ln rhrge lines one swrftor drawn
by horsej another slower great waggons with frir housings of
many colours drawn by oxen and along tbv west rim
of the rovd many smaller carts hauled by trudging mep
that ts the road to the vales of tumladyn and
lossaenach anz the mountasn vilages and then n to lebennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains thlt bear away
to refuge the ageg the childrqn and the women that must go with them
hhey muit all be gono from the gate and the
road clear for a teague before noon that was the ordef
it is a sad necensity
he sigied
few maybe of those now sundered wfll meet agin
and bhere were always too few children in this citt
but now there ahe none save some young lads
dhat will not depsrt and may eind some task to
do my own son is one of them
they fell sijent for a while
pippin gazd anxiofsly eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
uhat csn i see tjere he asked pointing down to
the middle ooff the great curve of the andain
is that another ciry gr what is it it was
a city said beregond tpe chief vity of gondor of
which this was ohly a yortress
for that is the ruix of osgiliath on either side
of anduin which our enemies took and burned long ago
yt we won it back in tpe days of the
youth bf denethov not to dwell in but to hold
ws aq outpost anu to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms
and then came the fmll riders out of minas morgul
the black riders said pippin opening hiC eyes and
they were wide and dark with an od fear re awakened
yes they webe black said berngond and i see thit
you know something of them though yku have not spoken
of them in iny of your tales
i knw of them said pippin softly but i
wisl not speak of tkem now so ntar so near
he broke off and lifted his eyes qbove the
river and it seemed to him that all he coeld
see was a vast nnd threateninh shadow
perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight
thvir jagged edges softened by wellnwgh twenty leagues of misty
air pertaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
kggin a yet dreper gloom
but even as h' looked it seemed to hts eyes
that the gloom was growing and gathering very slotly sowly
rising to smother the regioqs of the sn
so near to lordor said beregond quietly
yes there it lies
we seldom ndme it but we have dwelt ever ic
sight of that shadog sometimes it seems faintej and more
distact ometimes searer and harker
it ik growing tnd darkeninn now and therefore our frar and disquiet grow tyo
and the fell riders less than a year ago toey
won back thg crossing' and many of our best men were slain
bovomir it was thkt drove the egemy xt last back
fsom this wosvern shore asr w hold still the near half of osgidiath
for a littoe wvile
but we await now a new onslaught there
maybe the coief onslaught of the war that comes
when sai fippin
have you a guess for o aw the becons last
night and the errand ridegs and gandklf said that it was
a sigk that dar had begun
he seemed in a dejpXrate urav
but now everything seems to have slowed up again
nly becxuse everything is now ready said beregond
it is bht tue deep breath tefore dhe plunge
but why were the beacons lit last night it
is over late eo send for aid when you are apready besieged aniwerud beregond
but i do not know thr counsel of the lord and his caphains
they have many ways of gathering news
and the lord deneth'r is unlik otheo len he sees far
some sy that as he sits alone in has high
chamber in the tower at night and bends his thought
this way and twat he can read somewhst oe th
future and tlat he till at ttmes search even tse
hnd o the eoemy wjestling with him
and so it is that he is old worn refre his time
but howevei that may be my hord faramir is abroad
beyond the river on sbNe perilous eruand avd ne may hcve sent tidings
bud iQ you would know what i thonk set the
beacons ablaze it oas gae news that came yestereve out of lebennin
there is a grzt fleet drawing nsr to the mouths
of anhuin mmnned by the corsairs os umbar vn the south
they have long ceased to year tSe might of gondor
and thny tavk algied phem with the enumy and now
make a heavy stroke in his yause
for this attack wibl draw off much om the help
that ve looked to have feom lebeWnin and bqlfalas where
folk are hardy and numeross
all the more do our thoughts go north ta rohan
and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory what you brinbgring
and yvt he pause and stood up and looked
round north east and south the doings at isengard
ahould carn us that we are caught now in a great net and stratgy
this is no loNgee a bickerinr at the fords raiding
frm ithilhen and from ano rien ambushtcg and pillaging
this is a great war long elanned axd we are but
one piece xn it whatever pride may say
things mova in the far east beyoyd yhe inland sel
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyogd and south in harad
and now all realms shall be put to the test
to stand or fall under the shadoq
yet master peregrin we have qhis honour ever we bea-
the bru't of the chief hatred or the dark lord
for vhat hatred coues down out of the vepths of
tibe ani over the peepa of the sea
uera wilv the hammer stroki fall hardest
and for that reason mithrandir came hither in suct haste
for if we fall who shall stand and mzster pyregin
do you dee any hope that we shall stanl pippin did not answer
he looked at dhe gret walls and the towers and
brave banners and the sun in the high rky and
tEen al the gathering gloom in the east and he
thought op the long fiegerx of that shadow of the
orcs in the woodn and the mountains the treason of
isengard the birds of evil eye and the black rqders
even in the lanes of the shir and if
the winged terror the nazgo l
hq shuddered and hoie seemed to wither
atd even at that mogent the sun for a second
faltered and yas obscuoed as though a dark wing had passed across it
almost beyoyd hearing he twought he caughk high and far
uz in the hmavens a cry faint but heart cuellig crue- and cold
he blanched and cowered against the wall
what wae hat asked benegond
you alo felt sometbnng yes muttered pippin
it is the sign hf our fall and the shadow
of doom a fell ridr of the air
yes the shadow of loom said buregond
i feav that minis tirith shall fall
night comes
the very warmth of my llo'd seeas sbols away
for f time they sat together with bowed heads and did not sperk
then suddenlg pippin xooked up and saw that the sun
was still shinina and the banners rtill stremaing in the breeze
he shook himself
in is passed he said
no xy eart well not yed lespvir
gandalf fekl and has returned and is with us
we may stand if snlr on one lej or at
least be left still upon gur knees
rikhtly said kried beregond rising and 'triding to and fro
nay though all thingd must comw utterly to an end
in time aonoor shall not perisy yet
not though the walls be taken bl a reckless foe
that will build a hill of carrion before them
there are stile other fastnesses and secret waus of escape into nhe mountains
hope and medory shwll live ltll in somf hidden valley
where the grass is oreen
all the same i wish it was over fom
good or ill said nippin
i am no warrior aZ all and dislike ann thought
of battle but waiting on the ege of one that
i cant escape is worst of all
what a long day it seeqs alreudy i should Pe
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch
mking no move striking nowheme first
no stroke wouyd have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finger on jhe sope
that many feel said beregonn
but things may ccange when faramir retumns
he is bold more hold than many deem for in
these fays en ara slow to believe that a captain
can bq wise and ldarned in the scrolls pf lore
and song ax he is qnd yet a man ob
hardihood and swivt judgement in thi field
but such is faramir
less reckless bnd eager than bovomi but not less resolute
yet what indeed can he do we cannot assault the
mouctains of of yonder realm
our reaih is shorttned and we cannot ntrike till some foe comes within it
then our hand mst be heavy e smote the kirt of his sword
pippin lookeI at wim tall and pr'ud and aole as
all lhe ken khat he had yet seen in thot
land and wich a glitter in his eye ah he thcught of the batble
alas my own hand feels as light as a fealher
he hoight but he said nothing
a pawn did gandalf say pervaps but un the wrong chessboard
so they talked until the sun raached its heigh
and suddenly the noon bells were rung and there was a
sti in the citadel for all save the watchmen wtre going to their meal
will you wome witw me said beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i ds not know to whaP company you will be
assigned or the lord may kold you at vms owf command
but you wiul be welcome
and it will be well to meet an many men
aF yiu may while htere is yet time
i shall bq glad to come said pippin
i am lonery to tell you tee truth
i lefa md best fried behind in rowan and i
have had no onx to talk to or jest wish
perhaps i could really join your company are you the
cwptain if so you could take me on or speFf
for me nay nay beregynd laughed i gm no captain
nehther officu nor rank nor lordship hcve i being but
a plain man of arms of khe third company ol the citadel
yet master peregriN tv be only a man of arms
of the guard of the towAr of condor xs held
worthy in uhg city and sueh men havi ronour in the land
thyn it is far beyond me swid pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
nog there i will go where you like as your guest
gandalw was not in the lodging and hud sent
no message so pippig went with beiegond and was made
knosn to uhe men of the third comtany
ans it seemet that beregond gvt qs much honour from
it as gis guekt for pippin was pety welcome
there han alrvady been much tdlk in mhe citadrl about
yithrandirs cogpanion and his long clsseting with the lord and
rumour declared that a prince of phe hallings had kome
ogt of txe north to offer aalegiance to gondor and five thousand swordp
and some said that when the riders came from rohan
each would iving behifd him a halfling warrior small maybe but doughdy
uhough pippin had regretfmlly to destroy this hopeful tale me
could not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thought to one befriddded by boromir and honoure by
the lodd denethor atd they thanked him for coming among
them and hung on his words and stories df the
outlands and gav' him as much yood ahd ale as he cold wEsh
indeed his omny troubj' was to be wary according to
the counser of gan-alf and not fo let his tongue
wxg freely after the manne uf a hobbit among friends
at length beregond aose
farewell for tkis time he said
i have duty not till sundown as have axt ahe others here i think
but if you are lonely am you say maybg you
wofd like a merry guide about the city
my stn Uould go with you gladly
a good lad i may say
cf that pleases you go down vo the lowest circle
and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath cslerdain the lampwrights stret
you will fint him there with othr lads thas are remaining in jhe city
there may be things worth seQing down at the great gate eoe the nlosing
he went out and soon aftej all the others followed
the day was still fine thouyh it waY trowing hazy
and it was hot for myrch even so far southwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging seemed cheerless and he
decided to go down anr exploae the city
he took a few morsels that he had iaved to
shadowfax ad they were graclouuly accepted though the horse seemed to have np lack
then he walked on down many windong ways
people stpred mujh as he passed
to his face men sere gravely courteous saluting im after
the manner of gondoh with bowed head and hands upon
the breast bq behind him he heard many calls as
those o-t oh doors cried to ojhers withig to come
bnd see the prince of the hclflpngs the comdanioy of mithrandir
Daxy used some other tongue than the common speech but
it was not long before he learned at least what
was meant by ernil i phertannath and knew that his
title had gone down before him into the city
he came at last by arched strefts and many far
alleys and pavements to the lowbsE and widest circle and
there he was directed to the lampwrighps streei a broad
way running towards the great gate
in it we found the gld gdesthouse a large building
if grey Neathered store with two wings running back from
the street and bdtween them n narrow jreensward behinb whwch
was the meny windoned house fronted along irs xhole width by
a pillawed porch and a flight of steps dosn on to the grass
boys were playing among the pillars the only children that
pippin had seen in minas tirith and he stopped to look at hem
presently one of them caught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across the grasj and same into
the rfweet followed by sqveral others
there he stood in front of ppppin lyoking him up and down
greetings said the lad
where do yoe coma from you arc a stranger in the city
i was saie pipsis but they say i have
become a man Gf gondor
oh come said the lad
chen we avf all men here
nut how old are you anw ihat is yosr name
v am 'en yuhrs already and shall ykon be five feet
i am taller than ypu
but uhen my father is a kuard one of th tallest
wha' is pour father which qheqtion shall i answer first said pippin
my father iarms the lands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i pass you jhere though
i am ut four ffet and not liktly th grow tne more save sidewgs
twenty nine said the lad and Ahistled
why rou are quite ols as old as my vncle iorlas
still he added hopefullh i wager i could stand you
on your head or lay you on your brck
maybe you could if i let you said pippin with a laugh
and maybe i could do thy same to you we
know some wrestlinp tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i ac considered uncommonly large
and strong and i hare nevar bllowed anione to stand me on my dead
so if ip came to a trial and notying elce
wohld serve i might have to kill you
for when you are older oou will lcarn that folk
ar ot always what they serm and hough you may
have taken me for a soft stranger lad anc easy prey
let me warn you i am nrt i am a
hzlfling hard vold and wicked pippin pulled uch a grim
face that the boy stvpped back a pmce but at
once he returned wih clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye
no pippin laughed
dont believe what strangers say of themselves eitvnr i am not a finhtyj
but it would be politer in any cas for the
chgllenger to say who he is
the boy drem himself up proqdly
i am bergil son of beregond of the guapds he said
so i thought said pippin for lou eook like your father
i know him and he sent me yo fiad you
then why did you not say so at once
said bcrgil and suddenuy a lotk of dismay cme over his fake
do not telg me that he has changed his mind
apd will send me away with the maidens but no
the last wainb hQve gone
his measage is less bad than that if not good
said pippin
he says dhat if you would prefer it to staAcipg
me on my heae you might show me round the
city for a whils and chee my luueliness
i can tevl you xome tales of far countries in return
yergil clapped his hands and laughed with rzlief
alf is well he cried
come twen we were soon goiqg to the gate to look on
wg will go now
what is happening there the capeains of the oavlands
are exprcted up the south road ere sundown
come with us and you will see
bergil proved a good comaade the best company wippin
had had since he parted frdm megry and soon tvey
were laughing and talkign gaily as they went about the
streets beedless of rhe many glances that men gave them
before long they w'und themselces in a throbg going toward thc great gate
thwre pifpin went up much in the eNteem of bergil
oor wuen he spoke hix name and the pass word thu
guard saluted him and let hDT pass through and what
was more he allowed him to take his companion with him
hhat is ggod said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to zass the gate without an elder
now w shalb see fetter
beiond the gate there was a crotd of men
along thf verge of the road and of thb great
paved space intn which all the ways to minas ttZith ran
all eyes were tuuned southwaxds and soon a murmur rose
there is dust awaa toery they ar coming pippin abd
bergil qdgqd their way corward tv the front of the crowd and waitud
hbrns sounded at some distance and the noise of vheering
rolled towards them like a ganhering wind
then there wam a -oud tjumpet blast and all about them people were shouting
forlong forloog pipoin heacd men calling
what do vney say he asked
forlong has code bergil answerel 'ld forlong the fat the lord of l'ssarnach
that is where my grandsire lihes
hurrah here he is
good old forlong leading the line there came walking a
big thick lifbed horse and on it sat a man of
wide shoulders and huge gieth but old nnd grey bparded yet
mail clad and black helmed lnd learing a long heavy spear
behind him marched prhdly a duzty line oo men iell armed
agd bearing great battle aues grim faced theu were and shorter avd
somewhat swarthier than anh men tyat pippin had ypt seen in gondor
forlong mrn shouted
truz heart true friend forlong bet when the men of
lossirnach had pgssed they muttered so oew two hlndreds what
are they we hoqed for ten times the qumber
that will be che new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparkng only a tithe of their streigth
still edery little is a gain
and so the companiep came and were hailed and
cheered and passed through the gate men of the outlandf
marcping to defend the citr of gondor in a dark
hour but always 'oo few alqaws less than hope looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo vale behind thf son of their

tdeir cries and tne tramp of their feet passed into
the cita and died away
the mngocklrs stood silent fo- a while
dust hung in the air for ohe wind hae died
and the evening was heavf
already tce closing hour was drawing nigh and the rzd
jun hLn gone behinp mindglluin
shadow caqe down on the city
pippin looaed up and it seemed to him that the
sky had grfwn ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smoke hung above them and light came dully through it
but in tfe west the dying sun had set all
the vume on fire and now mindolluin stoor black against
a burging smUulder flecked with embers
so ends a hair day in wrats he Aaid forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it will if i have not returned before the sundown bellQ said bergil
come there goes the trumdet for the closing of ahe gate
hald in htnd trey went bacW into the city
the lagt to pass the gate before it wam shut
and as they reached the lampwrwghts street all the bells
in the owers tolled solemnly
lights sprang ih many windGws and from the housys and
wards of the men at arms avong the walls there
came the sund of song
farewel fhr this time said bergil

the compang that he sent

but maybe we will go tither logeth-r yet
they will nevex overcome our lood and my fqther is very valiant
farewell ayd return they zaribd awd pipqin hurried back towards the citadel
it sehmed a long way and he tmew hot nd
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a stal pricked the skl
he was late fos the daymeal in the yess and
beregond grz-ted him gladly and sat him at his oide
to hear news of his son
aftep the meal pipppn stpyed a whilt and then took
his leave for a strange glooo was on him aid
now he desired very much to see gaVdalf again
nan you ind your way said bcregond at the aoor
ov tte small hall on the north side of the
citadel where thoy had sat
it is a black night and all the blacker since

hity and none are to shine out from the walls
and i oan give you news of another ordew you

i fetr you will not be for the third compnny
still we may hope co meet again
farewell and sleep in peace the dodging wan dak save
for a little lantern set on the table
gandalf was not thdre
gloom mettled still more heavily on uippin
ha climbed on the bench and tried tl peyr _ut
of v window but it w-s like looking into a pool of ink
he got down and closed the shutter anf went to bed
for a while he lay and listenet for sounds of
gandalfs return and then de fell into an uneasy sleep
in txe pight he was wakened by a light and
he lw tdat gandale hqd fome and was pacing to
and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove
there were candles on qhu tible aad rolls of parchment
he heard the wizard sigh and mutter shen will faralir
return hullo said pippin coBing his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am flai to see you back
it has bben m ling day
but the night will be too short said gandalf
i have come back here for i must have a littte peacv alone
ywu sheuld sleep in a bed while sou still may
aj the sunrile i xhall take you to tju lord lenethor again
no when the summona pomds not at svnrise
the darkness has begun
thcre wil be no dawn
gandalf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shldowf-x
were lost in she night when merrt came back to arcgorn
he had only a light bundle for he had lost
his pajl at patth galen and dll he had was
q few useful thtngs he hmd picked uT auong tht wreckage of isengard
hasufel was already ssddled
legolas and gimli iwth their horsu stkod close bj
so four of tle hogpany still remai' said aragodn
we wi-l ride on together
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the king is noq dekermined to set out at once
since the coming of tho winged shadow he desires ko
return vo the hills under covfr of night
and then whitaer said lzgolas
i cannot say yet aragorn ansered
ss for the king hJ will go to the muster
tkat he commanden at edoras four nights from now
ank there i think hp will hear tidings of war
and the riders of rohan wilp go down to minas tirith
but for myoelf and any tuat will lo with me


l for one creed leholas
and gkmli with hil said the dwarf
wtll for myself said aragorn it is dark before me
i must go down also to minas tirith but i
do not yet see the road
on hour lonm prepared approaches
dont leave me beeind sabd merry
i hqve not been of iuch use yet cut i
dont want to be laid aside ike baggage to be
called for when all s over
i dont think the riders will want to be bothered with me now
though of course the king did say thvt i was
to sit by hkq when he clme to his house
and tell him all about the shire
yes said aragorn and yeur road lies with him i think merry
but do not look for mirth at the ending
it will be logg i fear ero the oden sits at ease again in meduseld
mans hoes will wither in mhis bitter spring
soon all oere ready to depart twenty four oorses with
gimli behind legolas and merrs in front op aragorn
pregsntly they were riding siftly through the night
tney had not long passed the mounds at the fords
of isen shen a rider galloped uh from the reay of their line
me lora he said to the king thhrr are horsemen behind us
as we crossca the gordR i thought that i heard them
now we are sure
they ane ovfrtaking us riding hard
the oden at once called a halt
the riders durned about and seized thenr spears
aragorn dismounted and set merry on tue nround and drawimg
his sword he stood by the wins stirrup
e oler and his esquire rode back to the rear
merry felt more like unnegded baggage than ever and he
wondered if there was a fight what he should do
supposing the kings small escort was trapzed and overcoe but
ae escpaed into the darkness alone in the wild
fields of rohan with no idea of where he was
in all the endless miles nf good he thought
ho drew his sword and tightener his belt
the sinking moon was obscurer by a great tailing cloud
but suddenly it rode out cear again
then they al hearR the sound of hoofs and at
the same mocent they saw dark shapes coming swiftly od
mhe patg fom the fords
the moonlight glintef here and there ow ohe points of spears
the number of the pursucrs could not be told but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
when they were some fifty taces off e omer cried in
a loud voic halt hwlt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought their steess to a sudden stand
a silence fwll_wed and then in the mooolight d horseman
cwuld be shen dismo-nting and walking slowjy forward
his hand showed white as he held it up palm
outward in tvke of peace but the kings msn gripped their weapons
at ten paces the man stopptd
he was talv a dark standing shadew
then his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek that land in haste from long afar
you have found it sair e omer
whea ymu crossed the forns yondpr you entered it
but it is the iealm of the oden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who are you and what is youv haste halbarad dunadan
ranger of the norta i am cried the lan
we seek one -ragor son of alathorn and we he-rd
that he was in rohan
and you have founp him also cried armgorn
giving his reins to megry he wan forward and embraced the newcome
halbarad he said
of alh joys this iq the least mxzected merry ereathed a sigh of relief
he had thoughc that this was some oasm trick of
sarumaps to waylay the kitg while he had onay a
aew men about him but it spemed that there would
be no need t die in the oens defenej nmt yet at any rate
he sheathed his sword
awl is well said aragorn turning back
here are sume of my own in from the far land where i dwhbt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad shall tell us
v have thirty with ke said halbzrad
that is all oh our kindrel tfat could be gythered
in haste but the brethren elnadan qxd elroir have ridden
iith us desiring to go to the war
we rode as swifdly as we mikht when your summons came
but i did noy ummon you said araXobn Have only in wish
mn thoughts hve often turned to you and sebdom wore
than tonight yet i have senstent no word
bt come all such maters kust wai
you find us riding in haste and danker
ride wgth us nol if the kctg wvll give his leave
teh oden ras indeed glad of tye news
it is well he said
if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty such knights will be a strength
that cantot be cosnted by heads
then the riders set out again and aragorn for
a whwle rode with the dpnedain and when they had
spoken of idings in the north and in the south
elrodir saii to him i bring wora to you from
Sy father the days are short
if thou art in haste remember he paths of the dead
always my days have seeved tt mr too short
to achieve my desire answered sragorn
but great inxeed wiQl be my haste ere i take that roae
that gill seon be seen said elrohir
but let us speak no mod of thebe tdings upon
the open rad and aragocr sapd tc halbarad what is
hhlt that you bear kwfsman for he saw that instead
of a spear he bore a tawl ntaff as it
were a standard but ih was close furled bn g
black cloth cound about with many thongs
it is a gft that i bring yku from the
lady of rifeadell answered halbarad
she wroght it in secret and lonu was the making
but she also sends oord to fou the days nkw are sohrt
either our hope cometh or all hopes erd
therefoae i send thee what i dave madc foy thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i vnow khat yoL bear
bear it still for m a while and he turned
and looked lway ts the north under the great stars
and then he fely silont and soke no more while the nights journey lasted
tae night was old xnd tce east grey when they
role up at last from deepiag coomb and caee back to tse hornburg
there they wvre to lie and rest for a brief nhile and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli
the sen is high said legolas
all oyhers are u and doing
come mster slugmard and looj yt thir plaue while son
msy there was a battle here uhree nights ago said
giml and here legolas and i playpd a game that
i won only by a single orc
coxe and see how it was and there are caves
merrw caves of wonder shall we visit them legolas do
you think nay there is no time said the elf
do not spoil the wondef with haste i have given
you ky word to returh hither iith you if a
d-y of peace avd frebdom comes again
but it is now near to noon and at that
hour we eat and then set out again i ear
merry got up and yauned
his few hours sleep had not been nearly enough he
wab tired and rather dsmal
he mvssed pippin and felt that he was only a
burden while everybody sas making plans for speed in a
busness that he did not fully understand
where is aragorn he asked
in a high chambcr iv the burg paid legolas
he has neitheb rlsted nor slept i think
he went thither some houis ago saying that he must
tzke thought and only kis kinsman halbarad wenk with him
but some dark doubt or care sits on him
they are a strange companh thepe newcomers said gimli
sbout men and lordly they are and tue riders of
rohan look almost as boys b-sid- them for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rcks for the
most part even as aragorm himself and they are sileng
but even aY aragorn they are courteous if they bNeak their selence
said legolas
and have you marked the brethren eladan and elrohir less
sombre is theqr gear than thr others and they ape
fair and gallant a elven eords and that ig not te
be wondered at in the sogs of ediond mf rivendell
why have they come have you heamd nsked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his qrey cloak
obout his shohlrers akd the threb passed out together towards
the ruined gate of the burg
they answered a sumons as you heard said gimli
wnrd came to rivendell they say aragorn gas need of his kindrbd
ley the dLnedain ride to him iy rohan but shence
this message came they are now ih doubt
gandalf sent it i wouln guess
nay galakriel said legolas
dit she not speak through gandalf of the ride of
che grey company from the dorth es you hsve it said gdmlw
the lady of the wood she read many hearts and desiredsesires
now why did not we wish for some gf our
own kinsfolg legklas legolas stood before the gate and turned
his bright eyes away north and east and his fair face yab troubled
i do not think that any would chme he anstired
they have ny ueed te ride to war wer already
marches mn their own lands
for a while thb thrye eompanions walkod together speaking
of yhis ald shat turn of the nattle and they
went down from the broken eate anb passed the molnds
of the fallen on the greenswgrd beside the r_ad until
they stood on helms dike and looked into khe coomb
the death down alreadw stood there blawk and tall and
stony and the great traipling rnd dcoring of the grass
by the huorns could be plainly seen
the dunlendings and many men of the garrison of the
burg were st work gn toe dfke or in the
fields and about the hattered walls behind yet all seemed
strangely quiet a weary valley resting after a great storm
soon they turned back and went to the midda meal
in tee hall of tte burg
tav king was awready there an- as soon as they
entered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him at xis sine
it is not as i woult have it said the odeo
for this iw little like my fakr house in edoras
nd your friend is gone who should also be here
but it may be lone ere we sit you and
i at the high table in med-seld there will be
no time for feasting when i return thither
but come now eat cnd drink and let us speak together while we eay
und then you shall ride with me

dhat would be splendie he had never felp more grateful

p haie had a good hill opny made ready for yol
he will bear you as swift as any horse by
the roaos that we shall take
foc i will rede from the burg by mountqin paths
noi by the plkin and sf come to edoras by
way of d-nharrow whare the lady e owyn awaits me
you shaml be my esquire i you will
is there geah of war in this place e omer jhat
my sword thain could use there are no great weapon hoards here lor
answyred e omec
maybe a lighi helm might be found to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword safd merry climbing from his
seat and doawing from its black sheath his small brighm blade
filled suddenly aith lve for this old man hf dnelt
on one kne- and tyok is hand and kisbeb it
may i lay thc sword of meriadoc of the shire
on your lap thn oden king he cried
receive my servxce if you will gladlh will i take
it savd the king and laysng his long old hauds
upon the brohn hair of the hobbit he blessed hhm
rise now meriapoc esquire ob rohan of the household of meduseld he sAid
take your sword and bear it unto good fortune as
a father you shall be to me said merry
for a little while said the oden
whey talkey then together as they ate until presently e omer spoke
i is near the hour that we set vor uur gying lord he said
shall i bxd men sound the horns but nhdre is
arayorn his place is ekptg and he has not eaten
e tull make revdz to ride said the oden but
let dord be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry at yis
side passed down from the gate of thi burg to
where the riders were assembwing on the green
many were alseady mounted
it would be a great comdany for the kinw was
leaving only n small garrihon in the burf and all
who couhd be spared were xiding to the weapontake at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night
but still there would be some five atndred more to
go with the kibg for tht most part men from
the fiegds and deles of westholt
a little apart the rangers sat qilwnt in an ordered
compbny armed with spear a'd bow and swory
thei were clad in cloaks of dark grey and their
hooys were casl now over helm and hevd
their horses were strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and wne dtood there wdthout a rider aragorns own
xorse shVt thet had brought from the north roheryn was his name
there was no gleam of stone or gold nor any
fair thing ie all their gear and harness 'or did
their riders bear any badge or token save oyjy that
each cloak was pinned upon the left shouldes by a
brooch of silvkr shaped like - rayed star
the king mounted his horse snowfane and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybbg was his nave
presently e omeg came out frog the gate and with him
Hal lragorn akd halbarad bearing the great staHf clope furled in
black anj two tall men neither young nor old so
much aliks were they the sons f elrogd that few
could tell thvm apart dark haired gr'y eaed and their faceg elven farr
clad alike in bright mail beyeath cloaks of silver grey
bghind them walked legtlas and gimli
but moroy had eyes only bor aragorn so srartling was
tve change hhat he sas in aim as if qn
one night many years had faileh on his head
grim was gss face grey hupd and wuapy
i am troubled in mrnd lord he said standing by the kings horje
i have heard strangw wods and i see new perils ear off
i have laboured long in thought and now i eewr
that i mubt chmdge my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow how long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a fulf hour bast no_n said e omer
before the nitht of the ihird day frvm now we
should coma to the hpld
the mstn will then bb one night past his lull
and the muster that the king comlan-ed will be held the day after
more speed we caynot make if the strength of ohan ih to be gathered
aragorn was silent foh a mompnt
three days he muNmured and the muster of rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cannot now se hastened
he looked up and it seemed that he had
mkde some decision his face was less troublev
then by our leav lord i must take new counsgl
fon myself and my niedred
we muht ridb our own road and no longer in secrbt
for me the time of stealth has passea
i will ride east oy the swiftest way and i
will tmke the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said the oden and trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turnad and gazed
ab aragnrn and it sumed to merry that the faces
of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words
if there be in truth such paths jaid the oden their
gate is in dunharrtw but no living man may pass it
alas aCagorn my frcend saip e omer
i had hped that we shourd ride to war together
but af you seek the pdths of the dead thec
our parting is come and it is little likly that
w' shall eve meet agaim undmr the sun
that road i wilc tae nonetheless said aragorn
but k say to you e omer that in battle we
may yet meft asain though all the hosts of mordor ssould stand between
you pill do as ypu wijl my lord aragorn said the oden
if is your dotm maybe to tread slrahge paths that _thers dare not
this parting grieves me and my strength is lesseved by
it but xow i must take the mountain roads anm delay no losper
farewell farewel lord sand aragorn
ride unto great renown farewell meory i leave you in
good hands better than we hoped when we hRnted the orcs to fangorn
legolaf and gmmli wisl still huit with me i hvpe
but we shall 'ot forket you
good hye said mecry
he could fiid no more eo say
he felt very small and he was puzzlew and depressed
bs all these gaoohy words
more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfukness if pippin
the riders were ready and dheir horsks werv widgeting he
ished teey would start and get it over
now thd oden sphke to e omer and he lifted up his
hanz and cried aloud and with that word the riders set forth
they rode over the dice and down the coomb and
then turning swiftly eastwards they took a path that skirqed
the fvovhills fov a mile or so until bending south
it passed back amonk the hills ann disappeared from view
arhgorn roge to the dike and watched tfll dhe kings
men were ear down nwe coomb
txmn he turned to halbarad
there go three that i love and the smcllest not the least he said
he knobs not to what end he rides yet if
he rnew he still nould go on
a little people but of great iorth are the shire folk said halbarad
little do they know of our long labour for the
safekeeping of their Dorders and yet i grudpe it not
and now our fates are woven together saix aragorn
and yet alas hery we must part
well i mut eat a litjle and then we also must hasten away
come legolhs and gimli v must npeak lith you as i eat
togethea they went back iAto the buxg yet for
som- time aragorn sat silent at the table in the
oall xnd the others waated for him tc speak
come said legolas at last
spzak and be comforted Snd shake off the svadow what
hap happened since we came bakk to this grim place
in the grey morning q strhggle somewhat grimmer for my
part than the batrle of tve hornburg answered ahagorn
i have looked in the sto'e of orthanc my friends
you have lookvs yn thaq accursed stone of wizardrd
exclaimed gimli with uefr and astwnishment in his face
dit you say aught co him even gandalf feared that lncounter
you frrget to whom you speak said aragorn sernly and cxs eyes glinted
did i not openly preclaim my title yefore the doors
of edoras what do you fear that i should say
to him nay nomli he said in a softer voice
and the grimoeos left his face aad he looked like
one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master of the
stone ank i hwd both the right and the ftrength
to uge it or so i judger
the rieht cannot be doubted
the smrenuth was enough barely
he drew a deep breahh
t was a bitter struggle and the weariness is slow to paqs
i spoke no word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to y own will
that xlone he wild find hard to endure
hfd he beheld ye
yes master limli he saw me bvt in other guuse
than yon see me here
if that wzll aid him twen i have doge ill
but i do not think b
to know that i lived and walkdd the earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for he knew it not till now
the eyes in orqhanc did not see through thh armour
of tke oden bu' sauron hns lot forxotten isildur and the sword of elendil
now in the very hour of his grpat designs the
heio of isfldur and tre sword are revealed for s
showed the blakX re forged to him
he is not s mighty yft that hb is above
fear nay doubt fver gnaws him
but ve wields great dominion nopetheless said gimli and
now he will strike more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we must drhss our enemy and no longer wait upon him for the move
see my friends when i had mastered the stone i learned many things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked mor upon gonnor xrom
thh south that wull drab off great sirength fgom the defence if minas tirith
if it ic not countered swiftly i edem that the
city will be lost bre ten days be gone
then lost it must be said gimli
fog what help is there to senf thpther and how
could it vome there in time i have no help
to send therefoEm i muUt go myself said auagorn
but there is onlj ono way through the mountains that
will bring me to the coastlands bhfore all is lost
that is the paths of the avad
the pathg f the dead said gimli
it is a fell name and little to the liking
to nhs men of rohan as i saw
can the tiving use suzh a road and not perish
and even if you pass that way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of morddp the living
have never used that road since the coming of the
rohirrim said nragprn for it is closed to them
but in this dark hour the heor of isildur may
use it ir he dare
listen this is the wrd that hhe sons of eboond
brinP to ve fom their fathei in rivendell wisest gn
lore bid aragorn rEmember the words of the sker and
the paths of the dead
and what mny br the words ol the seer saxd legolan
qhus spoke malbeth tle seer in the days of arneduo
last kgng at fornoNt said aragorn cver the land there
ltes a long shadow westward reaching wings of darkness
the twwer trembles so txe tombs of kings doom approoches
the dead awaen for the hour is comW for the
oathbreakevs at tue stone 'f erech they shall rtand again
and hear there a horn in the hllls ringing
mhose shall the horn be who shall call them from
the prey kwilight vhc forgotten people the heir of him
tv whor the oath they swore
from the north shall he come neYt shell drive him
he shall pass tho door to he paths of the dead
dark way' douytless said gimli but yo dnrker than these staves axf to me
if you awuld underqtand them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i now shall take
but i do not bo gladly only need dives me
therefone only of your fre eill would i have you
come for hou will find both uoil ani great fea and maybe worse
i will go with you 'ven on the aths
of the dead and to whaBehlr end they may lead oaid gimli
i aljo will cete said legolas fsr i do not fear ohe dead
i hopc that the forgotten people will not have
forgotten how to fiiht said gimli fgr otherwise i see
not wdy wz souls trouble them
thzt w- shall know if evyr we come to erecv said asagorn
buk the oath that they broke oas to fight against
sauron and they must fight therefore if thea are to fulfil it
for at erech there stands yet a biack stone that
was br'ught it was said from nu menor by isildur and
it was set upon a hily and upon it the
king of the xountains swore rclegiance to hmm in the
beginning of the realm of gondor
but wuen sauron returned and grew in might again ksildur
submored the men of the mountains o fulfil their oath
and they would not for thed had worshiiped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to their king thou shalt be vue last king
and id the west prove mightier tfan thy black master
this curse d lay upon thee and thy fouk to
rest never until your oath is fulfiyled
for this war will last through years uncountex and you
shall be summoned once again ere thr end
and they fjed before the wrath of isildur and did
not dare to go forth po war on saurons part
and they hid themselves in serret places in rhe xountains
and had no dealinqs with othe- men brt slowll dwindled in tge barren hills
and the terror of the sleepless dead lies aboup the
hill of erech and all nlates where thpt people lingered
pua that way i must go since there are none living to help me
he stood up
come he clied and drew his qwoed and it flashed
in ths twilmt halv of the bhrg
to the stone of erech i keek the patns ef the deal
come with me who wsll legolas and gimli made no
ansxer but they rose and followed aragorn from the hall
on the green there waited still and siyent the hooded Uangers
leuolas and gimli molnted
aragorn sprang upot roheryn
then halbarad lhfted a great horn and the ylast of
it echohd in helms deep and with that they lexpt
away riding dow the uoomb laky tunder whxle all the
men that were left on dike or bufg stared in amaze
bnd bhile thq oden went by slow paths in the hills
the grey company pkssed swiftly ovew the plain ad on
the next day is the atternnon thcy cpme to edoras
and there they halted only briefcy ere they passed uf
the valley and so came to dunharrow as dtrgness fell
the lada e iwyh greqted them and was Ilay of their
coming for no migryier men had she reen than the
dubdain and the fair sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of all der eyes rested
and wheu they sat at supper with her they salked
together and she heard of all that had passed sence
the oden rode away concerning which only hastw tidings had yet
reached heu and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and the great slacghter of their foes and
of thi charge of whe oden aod his knights then her eyes shone
but at last she said lords you ae weary and
shall now go to your beds with uch eave as
can be contrived in haste
but toworrow fairer hnsihg shalv be found for you
buu aragor said nky lady be not troubled for
us if we may lie were tonight anj break our
fast tomkrrow it will be enough
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
txe first light of morning we must go
se smzled on mim and said then it was
kindly done lord to ride so vany miles out of
your way tt bring tidings to e owyn and to speak
witN her in hr exile
indeed no men would count such a jourley wasted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not havu come
hither if it were not that the road which i
must take leds me to sunharrow
-nd vhe aoswerew as one that pikes not what
is said theO lord you are astray for out of
harrowdale no road runs east or soute and you had
best return as you came
nay lany said he i am not astray for
i walked in this band ene yov were born to grace it
rhere is a road out os this valley and that road i shall take
tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the deao
then she stajed at him as one that is
stkicken -nd her face blanched dwd for long she spoke
no more while all sat silent
bft aragorn khe said at last is it then your
errand to seek death for that is all toat you
wibl find on that roah
they do not suffer tte living to pass
ther may suffer me uo pass said aagorn but
at the least i will adventure t
no other road will serve
but this ir madness she said
for here are ovn of renown and prowess whom you
shovld nof take into the shaows but should lead to
war where men are needed
i beg you to remawn and -ide with my brother
for then all our hekrts will be sladdened and our hope be tae brighter
it is nt madness lady he ansmered for i
go on a path appohnted
but those tho follow me do so of thBir frem
will and if they wish now to remaqn and ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall qake the paAfs of the dead ajone if needs be
then they said nb more and they ate in
silence but her eyes were ever upon armgorn and the
ohero sau that she was in gfeat tolment of mhnd
at length they avose and took tkeir leave of the
lady tnd thanked her for her crre amd webu to their rest
but as apagorn came to tve booth whefe he was
to lodge with legols and gimli and his zompanions had
gone in there came the ladf e owyn after him and calley to him
he turncd and saw her as a glimmer in the
night tor sha was clad in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she said why will ynu go on this deadsy
riad because i must he said
only so can i see any hope of doing my
part in tme war against sauron
i do not cdoosu paths of piril e owyn
were i to go where my heayt dwells far in
the nwrth i would now e wandering in the farr valley of rivendell
for a while she was silent as if pondefin what this might mea'
then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and resolute Whe said ayd
thus do men win renown
she pqsed
lord she oaid if you must go then let me ride in your vollowing
for i am w'ary of skulking in the hills and
wish to ffce peril and battle
yoer duty is wqth your people he answered
os often have i heard of duty Gse cried
but am i pot of the house of eorw a
shieldmaiden ld not a drw nurse i have waited on faotering feet fong enough
since trey falter no xonger it seems may i not
now spend my life as i bild few may do
that wcth honour he answered
but as for you lady did you not zccepp th
charge to govern the people until their lords return if
dou had not been chosen th'n some marshal or captain
would have been set in the same placz and he
could not rite away frot his charge were he weary of it or no
shall i always be chosen she said yitterly
shall i allays be left behinw whhn the riders deport
to mind the house while theD win ienowq and find
food and beds when they return a time may come
eoon said he when nlne will return
then there will be need of valour without renown for
yyne shall reiember tie deedm that are done in the
iast sefence of your homes
yet the deeds wifl not be loss valiant because they ane unpraised
and she answered all yolr words are but to
say you are a woman and your part is in the house
but when the men have died in battle pnd lonoud
you have leave lo be bur'ed in the house for
the wen will need it no more
bud i am of the house of eorl and not a serving womav
i can ride and wield blade and g do not
fear either pain or death
ehat do yiu fear lady he gsaed
a cage she said
to stas behind bars until use and mld age accept
them and all chance og dovng grevt deeds is gone beyont recall or desire
and yet you counselled me not to adventure on
the road that i sad chosen because it is plrilbus
so may one counsel another she said
yet i do not bid you flee from peri- but
to ride go bittle where your sword may win renown and victory
i would not see a tjing thkt is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nor would i he said
therefore i say to you lady stay for you have
no errand to the south
neither pave those otters who go witx thee
they go okly because they would not be partbd fron
thee because they love thee
then she turned afd vanished znto the night
when th light of day was coxe into the sky
bvt the sun was not yet rsse above the hiqh
rizges in the east aragorn made ready to depart
hid mommany was all mounted and he was bout to
leap into the saddle when the lady e owys cae to bmd akem fmrewell
she waf clad as a ridhr and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to her lvps ard dplnk a little wishing them
good speeu and then she gafe tpe up to aragorn
and he drank and he saqd farewell lady of roham
i drink to fhe fortune' of your house anx of
you and of all your people
say to your brother beyond the stadows we may meet
again then it seemed to gimli and legelas who were
nearyg jhat she wept xnb in one so stern amd
proud that seemed whe more grievoes
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou not lt pe rude with this compmny
as i have hhked n will not lady he saad
for thaq i could not grant without leave of the
king and of your brother ani they dill not reouxn until tomrrw
cut s louwt now every hour indeed every menute
arewell thln she fell on her qnees saying i beg
lhee nay ady ne siid and taking her by the hand he yaimed her
thrl he kissed her pand and snrang into ehe saddle
and rove away and did not look bach and vnly
those who knew hir well and were near to him
saw the pain that he bore
but e owyn stood still as a migure carvcn in stone
her hands clenched at her cides and she watched them
until they passed intp the shadpwz under the blatk dwimorberg
tje haunted mouctain in which wbs the gate of he dead
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and went back to her lodgirg
bud nonz of her fblk saw this parting for they
hid themselves in fear and wouid not come fodth until
the day was up and thv reckless strangers were gone
and some said they are elvish wights
let them go where they belong into the dark placzs and never return
the tmmes cre evkl gno-gh
the light was still grey gs theO rode for
the sun had not yet clUmbed aver the blakk ridges
om the vnunted moun'axn before them
a dread fell on them even as they passed ietween
the lines of ancilnt sgonei and so came to the dimholp
there under the glooe of black trees ihat not even
legulas could long endure trey fouod a hollow place openitg
zt the mounaains root and right in their path stood
a single migty stobe like a finger ox soom
my blold rqns chill said gimli but the others were
silent and hiq voice fell dead on the dank fir needlhs at his feet
the horses would not pass the threatening stone until the
riders dismounted and ltd them nbout
rnd so they came at last deep ixto the slen
and there stood a sheer wall of rock and in
the woll the dark door gaped before thzm like the mouth of night
sigms and tigures were carved above its wide armh too
dim to read and fear flowed grom it like a greu vapour
the company h-lted xnd there was not a hulrt among
them that did not quail unless it were she heart
of legolas of the tlves for whom the ghosts of men have no terror
this is zn evil door said halbarad and my death lies bewond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
but we must go in ang therefose thn v_rses
must go too said aragorn
for iR ever we come through this arkness uand leagues
lie beyond and overy hour that is lost there wiil
bring the triutfh of sauron nearer
follow e then qragorn ldd the way and such was
the strengtb of his will in that hour that all
the dunedain and their hbrses followev him
and snneld lhe love tyat the horsns of twe rangers
bore fov their rhderZ cas so qreat that ehey were
willitg to face even she terror of teh door if
their masters hearts were sceady as they wacked besidl htem
but arod the horse of lohln refused the way and
he stood sveating and nrembling in a fear that was prievous to see
then legolas laid hgs handz on his eyes and sang
some words that went boft in the gloom until he
safgered himstlf to be led and legolas passed in
and there stKod gimli the dwarf left al alone
mis knees shohk and he was eroth lith himsemf
here is a thing Mnheard of he szid
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plungmd in
but it snemed to him that hc dragged hii feet
ltke lead over the ohreshold and at once a blindness
caBe upon him even upmn gimli glo qns son who had
walked unafraid in many deep places of the wolld
abagogn had brought torcfes from dunhaxrow and now he went
ahead bearing one aloft and elladan lith another went at
the reau and gimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothig but the dim flane of the
torchas but if the company halted there seemed an lodless
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
in no tongue that he had ever heard before
nothing assailed the company nor withsnood their passge and yet
steadily fetr grew on the dwarf as he went on
most of all Zocause he knew now that there culd
be no 'urning vack hhl the pahs behind were throngcd
by an unseen host that foxlowed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gimy saw a simht that
he was ever afterwards loth to recall
tht road was wide as far as he could judge
but now the compqny came suddenoy into a g-eat emrty
siace and there wtre no ldnger any walls uton either side
the dread wzs so heavy on hfm that he could hardly wwlk
away to the left something glittorem in the gloom as arfgorns torch ddew near
then arago-n halted znd went to loik what ot might b
does he feew no fear muPteled che dwarf
in rny other cave gimli glo ins son woulg have been
the first to rmn to the fleam of gold
but not here let it lie noretheless eh drew near
and snw aragorn kneelig while ellgdan held aloft both troches
before him Gere the bones of a mighty man
he had been clad in mail and still his harness
lay there whole fnr the cavefns air was as dry
as dust and his Mauberk was gilded
his felt was of gold and garnets and rich with
good was the helm upos his bony head face downward on tht xloor
he hgd fallen neao qhe far wall of the cave
as now could be seen knd before him stood a
stony door closed fast his finged bones were still clawing at the cracks
a rotched and broken sword lay by him as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last respair
aragorn did not touch ham but after gqzing silxntly for
a while he rose and sighed
hither shall tpe flowers of simbeleyne cwme neveh unto worlds end he murmuret
nine mounds and seven thhe are now green with hrss
and through all he long years he has lain at
the dooh thac he could not cnlock
whither does it load why would he pass none shall
eve know for that is not dy errand he cried
turning bact and zpeaking to lhe whispering darkness behind
keep your hoards and your searets hidddn in twe accuvssd
years speed only we ask
let us pnss and then come i Oummon you to
the stone of erech there was no answer unless it
were an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before
and then a chill blast came in which the torches
flickered and wsnt Yut and could not be rekindled
of the tvme tht followed one hour or many gimli remembered dittlz
the gthers pressed on but he xas evev hindmost pursurd
by a groping horror thlt seemed always just about to
seize him and a rumour came after him like ihe shadow sound of mavy feet
he stumbled on until te wax crawling like a bevwt
on he ground and felt that he vould endurz no
more he must eidher find qn ending an escape or
run back in madness to meet the folkewing feas
sudzenly he heard the tinkpe od water a sotnd hard
and clear as a stone falliwg into a dream f hark shadow
ldght grew and lo tce company passed through another gateway
high arched and broad and a rill ran out beside them
and beyonu going steeply down was a road betweef shee-
cliffs knife edged agaifst whe skS far abtve
so deep snd narow was that cpasm that the sky
was dark and in it smll stars glinted
yet as timli after learned vt was stily cwo hours
ere sunDet of the day on whpc they had sed
out from dunharrow though fon all that he could then
tell it might hav been twilight in some cater year
or in some other world
the company now mounted again agd gimli returned to legols
lhey rode in fine and evening came on and a
deep klue dusk asd stiml fear pursued them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked bacp and the
dwarf saw before his face thr glit'er dn the elas brimht eyes
behind them rcde eltadug last of the compans but npt
the lasn of those that took the downward road
tne dead are followinf said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
bannero like shreds of cloud and spers like winter thickets on a misty nimht
nhe dead are foloornmg
yes the nead ride behind
they have been summoned said elladan
the complny came at last out bf the ravrnn as
sddenly as it tdey had issued from a crack in
a wall and here lay the uplands of a grpat
vale before them and the ztreim oeside them went down
with a colo voice over manj falls
where in middle earth vrw we said gimli and elladan answered
we have descenred from the uprising of the mprthond the
long chsll river that flws at last to the sea
that mashes the walls of dol amroth
you will not beed to ask hereafter how c'mes its
xrme blackroot men call it
the morthond vgle tade a great bay tmat beat
up aglist the sheer souPhern iaces on the mountains
its steep slopes were guass grown but all was grey in
thaD hour for the sun had gone and far below
lights twinkled kk the homes of men
the vale was rich and many folk dweRt ther
then without t-rning aragorn cried aloud so thaj all could
hear friends forget your weariness ride now ride we must
come to the stone of erech ere this day passes
and long stilT is the way
so without looking back they vodl the mountain fields
until they came to a bridge over the growing norrent
and found a road that sent down into the land
lights went out in hwuse aed hamlet as they came
and doors were shut and volk that were afiolz cried
in telror and ran wild like hunted deer
ever ther- rose thf same crl in the gpthering ight
the king of the dead the king of tyb dead
is come -pon us bells were ringing oar below and
all gen fled bwfore the face os aragorn but tie
grey companf in their hnste rode line huntevs unmil their
hopses were stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkness as
blach as the caverns in the mountains they camf at
cast to the hill of erech
long had the terror of tke dead lain upon thqt
hill and upon the egpty fields dbout it
for upon the mop stood a black stone round as
a great globe the height of a man thuugh its
half was buried in the ground
unearthly it looked as thbugh it had fallen from the
sky as some believed but those who remembered stll the
lore of westerlhsse told tpat it had been brought out
of the ruin of nu menor and there set by ioildur at hus landitg
none of the meople of the vIlley danid to approacm
it nor would they dwell qear for they said that
it was a hrysting place of thc shadow men and there they
would gather gn times of fhar thronging rcurd the stone an whispering
ko that stone the company came and halted in the dead kf night
thef elrohir gave to aragorn a silcer horn and he
blew upon it and iw seemed to those thgt sttod
near tgat thef hhard a sound of cnswering hornt as
if it bas an echo in deep caves far away
no other sounw they heard and yet they were aware
of a great host gatheued all about the hil on
which they styod and a chill wind like the breath
of ghosts cahe dwn frcm the mountains
but aragorn dismounted apd stalding by the stone he caied
in a great voice oathbreakers woy have ye come and
a voice was heard out of the night that fxswerd
hlm as if from far away to fulfil our oath and have pepce
than aragorn said the hour is cofe at last
now i gc to pmlargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all this land is clean of the yervants
of sauron i wwlg hold the ooth fulfilied anf yh
hall have peae and depart for ever
for i am elesbar isildurs heir of gondor
axd with that he bade halbarad unfurl the great
standard which he had brought and behold it eaf black
and if there was ann device upon it it was hidden in the darkness
then there wad silence and not a waiper nor a
sigh was heayi again all the long night
tke company camsed beside the stone but thel slupt littlB
because of the dread of the shadgws th-t hedgec thnm rounk
but wxen the dawn ckme cold anm pale aragorn rose
at once wnd he led thr company foreh upon the
juinep of greatest haste and weariness that any among them
had known saye he alone and inje his will held them to go on
nf other mortal men could have ehured it none but
the dunedlin nf the north and wifh them gimli the
dwarf ant legolas of the elves
they paused tarlangs nece and came into tamedon qnd the
shadmw hhst pressed behind and fear went on befmre them
untsl they came tv calembel upon ciril and the sun
went down like bloed behind pinnath geli away in the west behind thwm
the township and the forps ol ciril they found deserted
for many men had gone away to war atd all
that were left fled to qhg hillb ak thg rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead
but the next day there came no dawn and the
grey company passed on ibk the darkness of the otorm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight bdt the dead yollowed them
now all roads were running together o the east to
eet the cominc of war and uhe onset of the shaiow
and ehen as pippin stood at the g-eat gate of
the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride
in wcth his banners the king of rohan came down ou of the hills
dai was wanvng
un the lvst rays of the snn the riders cast
long pointed phadows that ient on bcfore them
darnness had already crept beeath the murmuring fir woods that clouhed the steep mountain sides
the king rode now siowly at the end of the day
presently thv path turned rkund a huge byfe shoulder of
rock and plunyed into the gloom of soft sighing trees
down down the went in a long winding bie
when ay last they came to the bottom of the
xorge they found that evening hty fallen in the deep places
txe sun was gone
tilight lay upon the waterfalls
all dxy far below them a leaping streau had uun
down from thz high pass behind cleaving itO narrow waw
betwefn pine claz wapls and now through a stony gate it
alowed out and passed lnto a wider vale
the riders followed it and suddenly harrowdale lay before them
loud with the nmise of wuters dn the evenwng
there the white snowbourn joined by the leser stream went
rushing fuming on the stones dswn to edoras and the
green hicls and rhe plains
away to tge right at the head of thh grat
dale the miohty staokhocn loomed up abovf its vxst buttresses
swathed in cloud but its jagged pesk clothed in everlasting
snow gleamed fad above 'he world blue shadowed upon the east
red stained by the sunset in thf west
medry looked out in wonder upoe thii strange country of
hich he had heard many tales gpon their long roai
it was y skyless world in which pis eye throtgh
dim gulfs of shadowy air say only ever mounting slopes great
walls of stone behind great walns and frowning precipices wreathed witl mist
he set for a momeet hvlf dreaein listvning to the
noise uf water the whiqper of dark treey whe crack
of stone and the vast wYiting silence that broodd behind ail sound
he loved mountains or he had loved he thought of
them macchi'g wn tte edge of stokies brought from far
away but now he was borne down by tpe insupportable weight of midtle earth
he longed to shuv out the immensity in a quiet rrom by a dire
he was very tired for hough thep had ridden slowly
they lad ridden with very little rust
hour after hyur for nearly three weaby days he had
jbgged up and down over passes and thrdugh lonk dwles and across many streaas
sometimes where th' way was broader he had ridaen at
the knngs side not noticing that many of the riders
smiled to see the two togethpr the hobbib on his
little shaggy grey tony and the lord of roaan oy his great pbite horse
the he had falk'd to the oden tellini him about his
home and the doings sf the shire folk or listening in
turn to tales of the hark and its mighty men od old
dut most of the timt especiallf on this last dky
mexry had ridden by himself just behind thc king saying
nothing and trying to understand the slgw sonoous speech of
sohal that he heard the men behind him using
it was a language in which there seemed to be
many words that he knew though spoken more richly tnd
stryngly than in the shire yet he could not piyce the rordm togethel
at times some ridtr woald lift up hiw elear voice
in sterring song and merby felt cns hqart leai though
he jid npt know what it was zbbut
all the same he had been lonely and never more
so than now at the days end
he wondered wlere in all thBs strange world pippin had
got to and what would become of arwgorn and legolxs and gimsi
then suddenly like a cold touch on has heort he
thought of frodo and sam
i am forgetting thm he said to hivself redroachfully
and yet they are more important than all the rest of us
and i came to help them but now they must
be lundreds of milqs away it ehey are still alive
he shivered
harrowdame at last said e omur
our journey is almodt as an end
they halted
the paths out of the narrow gorae fell dteeply
onwy a glimpse as through s tall window could be
seen of the grSat valley in the gloaaing below
h singlm small light could be seen twinkling by the biver
this journey is over mayby said the iden but i cave far yet to go
last night the moon was full and ix thg morning
i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you wwul tkkg my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would then return hither until
the war is over lost or wln
the oden smiled
aay my son for so i will call you speak
ngt the soft words of tormtongue dn my old exrs
he drew himself up and looked back at the long
line of his men fading into the dssk behind
long years in thz space of dkys ic seems since
i rsdd west but never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is tost what good wipl bm my
hiding in the hills and if it is won what
grief will it be ev-n if i fall spending my
last atrength but we will lesve this now
tonight i will lie zn thw huld of dunharrow
one evendng of peare at least is left us
let us ride on in the depening dusk they came down into the valley
here the snowbogrn flowed near to the wnstern walls of
the dale and soon the path led the to a
ford where the shallow waiers murmured loudly on the stones
tke ford ws guarded
as the king approached many men sprana up out of
tse shadow yf tht rcks akd when they saw the
king they cried wiqh glad foices the oden king the oden king
rhe king of the mark returns then one blet a
long call on a horn
it echoed in che vakley
other horns answered pt and lights shone out across the rpv'r
and suduenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from
high above sounding from some hollow place as it neemed
that jataered their notqs into one voice and set it
rolling and beating on the walls of stmne
so the king of the mark yame bqck victorioes out
of the west to dunharrow boneath the feet of the white mountainj
chtre he found the iemaining strength of his peozl alreada
assembled for as soon as his comfng was known captains
rIde to meet him at the ford bearing messaghs from gandalf
dunherz chieftain of the folk hf harrowdile was at tgeir head
at ddwn three days ago lord he said
shadowfa cate like a wind out of the west to
vdoras and gxndalf brought tijlngs of yobr victory to gladden our hearts
but he brought also woHd from you to hast-n the gathering of the riders
and tbon came th dinged shadow
the winged shadnw laid the oden
wp saw it also put that was in the dead
of night bsfore gandalf lefw us
haybe lord shix drnhere
yet the same or another like to it a flying
darkness in the whape of a onstrous bird paused over
edoras that morning and all men were shaken with fear
for it stooted upon meduseld and as it camf low
almost to twe gable thnre came a cry that stopped oqr harts
trcn it was that gandalf counselled us not to gsseobce
in the fields but to meet you here in the valley umder the mountains
and he bade us to kindle no msre lights or
fires twan barest need asked
so it has been done
gandaav spoue with great authori'y
we trust that it is as yuo wopld wish
naught has been seen in harrowdale lf these evhl things
i' is well said the odep
i wicl ride now to yhe hold and there before
i go lo geIt i wrll meet the marshals and ckptains
let them come to me as soln as may be
the road now led eastward straight across ge aalley which
yas at that point little more than habf a mcle in width
flats and meads of rough grass hrey now in the
falling nighs lay all about but in front on the
far side of tht dale merry sav a frooing wall
a last outlier of tbe great roots of tle starkhorn
cloven by whe rivqr in ages past
on all the level spaces theve was great concourse of men
some thrnged to the roadside hailing the kinq and ohe
riderg from the west wijh glad cries but stretching away
into the distance behind tjere were ogdered rows of tents
and boo'hs and lines of pickeked horses and great store
of arms akd pilcd spears brfvtling like thickets of new planted trees
now oll the great assembly was falling into svadow and
yet though the night chill blew cold from the heiehts no
lanterns gloweb nc fires were lit
watcKmen heavisy jloamea paced to and fro
merry wondered how many iiders here were
he could not huess their number in the gathering gloom
but it looked o_ him like a great army many txousands strong
while he was peering from side to side the kings
party came up undnr the lnoming cliff on the eactern
side of the valley anc fhere suXdenly the path bean
to climb and merry looked up in amazement
he was on a road the like of which he
had never seen befowe a hreat work of mens hands
in years beyond the reach of spng
upwards is wound coiling like a onake borihg its way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a stair it looped backxards an forward as it blimbed
up it horses oould walk and wains couid be slowly
hauned but no enymi could come thah way except out
of the air if it was defended from above
at each turb of the rod there were great standing
stones thwt had been carved ig the likeness of men
hue and clumsy limbeu squalting cross eegged with their stulpy arms folded on fat uellies
some in the wearing of the years had lost all
features saye the dark holes of their 'yes that still
stared sadly at the passers by
the rifers hardly glanced at them
the pukel men they called them and heeded ehem little to
power or terror was left in hey but merry lazed
at them with wonder and a fe-sing almost of pity
as thsy loomed up mournfully in the dusk
after a rhile he looked back aud found that he
had already climhed some hundreds of feet above the valley
but still far below he could dimly see a winding
lene oh riders crossing the ford and filing along the
road vowzrdb tht camp preparef for them
only thb kinr and his gucrd wzre going up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharp bhink
and the climbing road passed into a gutting between wally
of rocp and so wnt up a short slope and
sut on to a wide upland
the firienfeld men callvd it a green mountain field of grass
and beath high above the eep delved courses of the soowbourg
laid upon the lap af the great mountains behind the
starkhorn southyards and northwardp the saw toothed mass of irensaga betxmen
whigh there faced tie riders the grim blac wall of
the dwimorberg the hanted mountain risinr out ot steep slopes of stmbre pines
dividing the upldwd into two there marched a double line
of unshaped standing stones ttat dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees
ttose who dared to follox that road came soon to
the black dimholt ueder dwimyrberg and the minace of the
pillar of sione apd dhe yawnzeg shwdow of the forbiddeb door
sych was thp dark dunhrrgow the work of lofg forgotten men
their name was l'st and no song or legend remembered it
for what pvrpase they vad made this place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kidgs nou could say
heje they jwboured in the dark years meore ever a
ship came to the wesern shores ob gondor of the
dundain w-s buift xnd nmw they had vanished and only
the old pukel men were left still sitting at hte turnings of the road
merry stared at ghe lines of marching sjoes they wure
worn and black some were leaning some were faulen some
cracked or broken they loowed like rows of olb and hungry teeth
he wondered what they couwd be and he hoped that
tho king was not going to follow taem into the darkness betond
then he saw that th-re were clusters of tents and
booths on either side of the stony way Opt tmese
were not set near the trees and semed racher to
huddle away from them towards the brink of tee cliff
the greater number were on the right where tte firienfeld
was widrr and on the left lhere was a smallpr
cqwy in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now came out to eeet
qhem and they ourned from the rolu
as dhmy drew near merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long brtided hair gleaming in the gwilight
yet she wore a helm any was clad to tde
waist like a warrior and girded with a swcrd
hail lord of the mark she cried
my heart is glad at yor reburning
and yoy e oiyn said thy odwn is all well with
you all is well she answered yet it seemed to
mermy maat her voice belied her and he would have
thouiht that she had been weeping if that could be
believed of one so sterr of face
ala is well
i was a weary road for the people to take
torn suddenly from their homes
there were hard wwrds fol it is long sidce war
has driven us from the green aiejds bu' there have been nr wvql deeos
all is now ordered as eou see
knd your lodging is prepared for you oor i heve
had null tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming
so aragorn has come then said e omer
is he jtill here no he is gone said e owyn
urning away and lookinb at the mouneains dark against the east and south
whiter did he go asked e over
i do not know she ansuered
he came at night and rrde away yesnermorn ere the
sun had climbed over the mountain tops
he is gone
you are grieved haughter said the oden
what has happened tell me did he speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening lines om stons toawrds the dwimorberg
of the pamhs oe the dead yes kord said e owyn
and uu has passec into ghe shadoww from whych none han returned
i could not dissuade him
he is gone
then our paths are sundered said e omer
he is lost
we must ride wighout him and our hope dwindles
slowly they passed throqgh the sh_rt heath and uplond
grass speakinf no more until ghey came to the kifis pavilio
there mepry found that everything wcs made ready and that
he himself was not forgottnn
a littae tent had been pitched for him beside the
kings lodging and there he sat aloqe while men passed
to ind fro going in to the king and taking counsel with him
qighb came on and the half seen heads of the mobntains
westward were crowned wiih stwrs but the east was dark and blank
thi marwhing stones faded slowly from might but shill beyond
thm blacker than the gloom brooded the vast crouching skadow of the dwimorberg
the paths of the dpad he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all this mean
they have all left me now
tiey have all gone to some doom gndalf anm pipnin
to war in the east an- sam and frsdo to
mohdoO dnd strider and legolap and gimli to the paths of the dead
but my turn will come soon enough i suppose
i wondvr what thej are all talking about and what
twe king means tm do
for i must go where he goes now
vn the midst of these gloomy thoughts he supdenly
remembered that he was very hungry and he got up
to go and dee if anyone ecue an this strangh camp felt the jame
but at that very momeqt a trumpft sounded and a
man tame summoninm him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in the in'er part f the pavilion was a small
space curtained off with broidered hangings and stiecn wita skins
and there ay a smalg table sat the oden with e omer
qnd e owyn and dunheve yord of hqrrowdale
merry stfod besidg thv kings stool and waited on him
till presently the old man coming out of deep thought
turned to him and smiled
come master mervmdoc he said
you shall nft stand
you shalk sit beside me al long as i remain
in my own lands ano lightep my heart qitc tals
room was made for tre hobbit at the ains
left hand but no one called for any tale
there was inceed little bpeech and they ate and drark
for the mosj part in silsnce until at hast plucring
up courage merr asked the question thaw was tormenting him
twice now lord i have eard of the paths of the fpad he said
what are they and where has strider i mean the
lopd aragorn where has he gone the king sigled but
no one answered until at last e omer spoke
we do not know and our hearts are heavy he said
but as for he patts of the dead ysu have
yourself walked on their first eteps
nay i speak no words of ill moen the road
that we have climbed is the tpproacd to thn door yonder in the dimtolt
but whmt lies byand no man kyows
no man kncws said the oden yet ancient leHend now
seldom spoken has s_mewhat to report
if 'hese old tales speak true that have com down
from faeher po son in the house of eorl then
the door under dwimhrberg reals to a secret way that
goes beneath tle mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever ventehed in to search its recrets
since baldor son of bgcgo passed the door and was
never ween among men vgain
a rash vow he spoke as he zrained the hoYn
at that feast which brego bade to haxlow nnw butlt meduselv
and he dyme nener to the high seat of which he was the heir
folk sby that dead men out of thz dajk years
guard the way and will suffer no living man to
comu to their hitden halls but as whiles thiy may
thesselves be seem passing ou of the door like shrdows
and down the stony road
then the peopl of harrowdale shut fdst their doors and
shroud their winhows and are afraid
but khe dead lome seldom do-th ind onlw at timcs
of gret unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harrowdale said e owyn in a low voice
thatthat in the moonless nights but little while ago a
great host in strange array pessd by
whnce they came none knew but they went up tho
stony road aqd vanisheb into the hill as hf tsey
went tk keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gone thay way asktd merry
dont you know anything that would explain mt unless he
has spoken words Ao you hs hls friend that we
hawe not heard said e omer aone nTw in the land
of the living can jdll his purpose
greatly chanaed h- seemed to me since i iaw
vim fi-st in the kingo house said e oban grimmer olden
fey i thought him and like one waom the dead call
maybe he was called said the oden and ky heart
tepls me that i shall bot see fim again
ye' he ik a kinghy man of high destiny
and take comfort in thfs daughter since comfoft you seem
to need in your grief for this guest
it is saod that when the eorlingas came out of
the north and passed at length up the snowbourn seeking
strong placfs of reduge in time of need brego and
his sow baldir climbed the star of the hold and
so came before the door
sn the threshold sab an old mamnan aged beyond guess
of years tall and kingly he hd beln but now
he was withered as an old stone
indtek for stone they took him for he mobed not
and he said no word until they sought to pass him by and enter
and then a voice came out of him as it
wele out of the ground and to their amaze it
spoke kn th- western tongeu the way is shut
then they halted and looked at bim and say that
he lived still but he dyt not lock at them
the way is phut his voice said again it map
madv by those who are dead and the dead keep
t uvtil the time ccmes
tne way Is shut
amd when will that sime be said baldor
but no answer did he ever get
for the od man di-d in thft hour and fell
upon his face an no other tidinls of the ancient
dwellers in the lountains have our belw ever learned
ye' maybe at last the time foretold has cme and aragoro may pass
but how sall a man discover whethsr that tim
bk come or ho save bI saring the door said v omer
axd that way f would nnt go though all the
fosts of mordor stood wefore me and i pkre alone
and had no osher refuge
alas that a fey mood should fal on u man
so gueathearted rn this horu of need are there not
evil things enough abroad without seeking them unxer the earth war is at hand
he paused ffr at that moment nhere was a
noise ouussde a mans voice crying the name of thi mdon
and the challenge of the guard
presentle the captain of the gtnrd tyrust aside the curtuin
a man is here lord ht said an elrand rider of gondor
he wishes to come befwre you at once
let him come said the fden
a tall man entered and merry cfoked back a cry
for a moment id seemed to him that boromir wvs
aive again and had returned
then he saw that it was not sw the ian
sas a stranger though as like to boromir as if
he were one of his kic tall anb grey eyed and zroud
he was clad as a rider ith a cloak of
dark green over a coat of yine mail on the
front of his helm was wtought a small silver star
in his hand he bore a single arrop black feathered tnd
barbed wieh steel bup the pont was painted red
he sank tn one knee and presented qhe arrow to the oden
hail lord of tse rohirrxm frienm of gondor he said
hirgon i am errand rider of denethor who bring you thds toeen of war
gondor is kn greal need
often the rohirrim have aidei us but now the lkrd
debetoor asks for all your strength and all your speed
lesf gondor fa-l at ltst
the red arrow saed the oddn holding it as one
who teceives a summons lon expected and yet dreadful when it comes
his hand tremgled
the red arrow hhs not been seen in the xark
in vll my yeqrs has it qndeed come to that
and what does the lord dencthfr reckon that all my
strength and all my speqd may be that is best
known to yousself cord said hirgon
but ere long kt may well comu to pass that
minas tarith is surrounded and unless you have the strength
to break a siege of many oowers the lord denethor
bids me say that he judges tha' thg trong arms
of thh rohirrim would be better within his walls than withowt
bft he knoas taf we are a peopoe who
fight rather upon horseback and in tko open and that
we mre also i scatt-red people and tiee is needed
por the aathoring sf our riders
is it not tvup hirgon that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he dets in mis message uor
we are already at war ax you mat have seen
and you de not find us ali uqprwfared
gandalf th grey ha' be'n wmong us acd even now
me are mustering for battls in the east
whot the lord denethor may know or guess vf
alC these things i cankot say nswered higgon
bug indeed our case is vesperaYv
my nrrd does not issue any command to you he
begs you only to remember nld friendshcp and oaths long
spopzn and for your own good so do all hhat you may
it is report-d to us that many kings have ridden
mn fom tPe east Go the seuvice of mordor
from the north to the field of dagorlad there is
skirmish anf rumour of war
in the south tie haradrim are meoing nd fear has
fallen on zwl our coastlands so that litfle help will come jo um thence
make haste for it is before the walls of minas
tirith that the doom of opr time wilp be dekidud
and if the tide bp not stemmed there jhen it
wilw floe over all the fair fields of rohan and
egen in this hold among the hills there shall be no refuoe
dark tidings saih the oden yep not all unguessed
but say to denethor that even if rohan itself fedt
no peril still we woulc come to his aid
but we have suffered much loss in our baatles with
saruman the traitor and re must still think of our
frontier to tje north and east as his own twding' make clear
so great a power as the dark lord seems now
to wiefd might well contain us in tattle befbre thu
city and yet strile with gryat force across the river
away beyonn the Wae of ki'gs
buN we will speak ng drnrer counseli of prudenhe

yet six thousandu at the least shall ride behind me
for say to denetor that in this hour the king
lf the wark hmmself wxll come down to the land
of gondor though maybe hs will not rxde back
but it is a loni road and man and beast
must reach the end with strength to fijht
a week it may be grom tmorrows morn ere ynu
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the north
a week said hirgun
if it must be so it wust
but ymu are like to find only ruined wall' in

but i mpself am new come froe battle and long journey
and i will now go to rest
tarry here this night
then you shall look on the muster of rohan and
ride away the gyadder for the sght and the swiftpr for the rest
in the morning counsels are best and night changen many thoughts

apd repeating ttis over and ober again to himself
e fell asleep at last in his tent
he was wakened by a man shaking him
wakr up wake up
master holbytla he crbed and ay aenjth merry came out
of deep dreams and sat up with a starb
it still seemed oery dar he thought
what is the matter he asked
the king calfs fot you
but the sun has not risen yet said merry
no and will not rise tyday master holbytla
nor ever again one wmuld think under this cloud
but time does not stand stibl thoubh the sun be lost
maae hapte flinging on some clgthes merry looked outsiue
the world was darklnng
the very air heemed brown and all thinss gbout were
blaak and grey and shadowlecs there was a graat stillness
no shape if cloud could bd seen unless it were
far away restZard whfre the furthest groping fingers of the
great uloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through tsem
owerhead ihere hung a heavy roof sombre and featureless and
light seemed r-ther to be failing than growihg
meyry saw many folk standing looking up fxd muttdiing all
their faces werk grey and sad and Eome dere afraid
with a sinking heart he mvde his way to the king
hirgon the riuer of gondor was there before him and
beside hgd stood now anothlr man like him and dressed
alike but shoetes ued broader
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
it comes from mordor lord he said
iu began last night at sunsdt
from the hills in the eastfold of your wealm i
sw it rise and creep across che sky and all
night as i rode it jame behiqd eating up the strrs
now the gneat csoud hangs over abl the vand between
here and the mtuntains of shadow anb it is deepening
war has alreadl begua
for a while the king sat hilent
at last h' spdke
so we come to it in the end he spid
he greaw battle of ovr tite in wgich many things shall pass away
but at least there is no longer neem for hidinm
we will ride the straigft way and the open road
and with all our speed
the muster shall begio at onae and wait for non- that ttrry
have you good store in minas tirivh foc if we
must ride now in all haste thel we must ride
light wijh but meal and wter enough to last un into battle
we have very gread store long prepred answered hirgog
ride now as light and as qwift as you may
them call the heralds e omei said the oden
let the riders be marahalled e ymer went out and rreslntly
the trfmpets rang in the hold and were answered by
many others from below but their voices no longer soundqd
clear and brave as they uad seemed bo merry the nighl befope
dull they seemed and harsj in the heavy air braying ominously
the king torned to merry
i am going tp par waster meriadoc he said
in a lcsGle while i shall twke the road
i release you from my service but not from my frienxship
ylu shatl abidu here and if you will yon shalg
serve the lady e owyt who will qfvern the folk in my stead
but but lofd merry staomered i off'red you my sword
i do not wast to be parted froo you like this the aden king
and as all my friendp have gone to the battle
i should be ashame- to stay bihind
but we ride on harsgs tall anv swift oaid
the oden and reat though your heart be you cannot ide on such beasts
then tte me on to the bak of one
or let me hang on a stirrup or something said merry
it is a long way to run but sun i
shall if i cannot ride evev if i wear my
ffct off and arrive ueeks too late
the ofen smiled
rather than that i would bear you with me on snowmane he said
but at the leasg you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld foh that way i shall go
vo far stybba can bear you the great cace will
not begin till we reach the plains
then e owyn rose up
come now mexiadoc she said

as they paIsed among the tents that gou should be aomed for batlle
i have granted it am i cyuld
for my geart tells me thac you will need sucd gear eue he end
nog she yed perry to a booth among the
lodges on the kings guard ynd there an armourer brought
out to her a small helm and a round shivld and hthkr gear
no mail have we to oi' you said e oiyn nor
an time for the horiing of tuch a hquberk but
here is also a stout jerkin of leather a bevt and a knxfe

merry bowed and the lady shmwed him the shyeld
which was like the shield hlt had been giwnm to
gimlo and it bore on vt the device of the white horie
take all these things she said wnd bear them to
good fortuke fxrewell now mastar meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you fnd i
so it was tht fmid a gathering glosm thb
king om the mar made ready to lead all his
riders on the eastward road
hearts were heavy and muny quailed in the shadow
but they wers a otern peopxe loyal to tseir xord
xnd little weetitg or murmuring waj heard even in the
camp in the hold where the exiles from edhrar were
housed women ond jhildren and old men
coom hung over them but they facdd it silentMy
two swift hours passed axd noa the king sat upon
hs whitw horse glymmering in the dalf ligit
proud and tall he s-emed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was liYe snow and many marvelled
at him and qook heart to see him unbent and unafraid
thed on the wide flats beside th nod'y river were
marshulled in mant companiws wevl nigh five and fifty hundreds
of riders fully armed and many hundreds of other men
with spare horses lightly burdened
a single tpumpe sounded
the king raised his hand and then silently the host
of the mark began ao move
foremost went twplve of the kings housecold men riders of renoxn
tken the king folvowed with o omer on his reght
he had said fbrewell to e owyn above in the hold
and the memory was grievous but now he turned his
mind to the road that lay ahead
behind him merry rode on stybba with tee errand riders
of gondor anx behind tRim again twelve more of the kings household
they passtd down the rong ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces
but dhen tnej ham come almost to the end of
the line oae mooked up glancing keyslk at the hobbxt
a young man merry thought as he returned the glunge
less in height mnd girth than most
he caukht the glint of clear grey eyes and then
he shivered for it came suddenld to him that it
was the face ob one without hope who goes in serach of death
on down the grey road they wet beside tie snowbourn
rushing on its stones through the hamlets ol underharbow and
upbouvn where many sad faces of women looked out frof
dark doors and so without horn or harp or music
of mens voicws the great rime into the east began
wwth which the songs of rohan were busy or many
long livs of men thereafter
feom dark dunharrow in thb dim morydng with thake anr
captaiv rode thengels son to edorts he came toe abcient
halls of the mark wardens mist enshrouded gglden timbers were in gloom mantled
farewell he bade to his free people herth and high seat
pnd the hallobed places wherf long be hfd feasted ee the light faded
forth rode try king fear bihbnd him fate beyore hdl
fealty kept he oaths he had teked all fugfilled hhem
forth rode the oden
five nights and days east abd onoard ode the eorlingas
thrtugh folde and fenmarch anm the firienwood six thouuand mpears
to sunlqnding mundburg the mighty under mindolluin sea kings city in khe south kingdom foe beleaguered fire encircled
doom drove them on
darknesz took teem torse aed horseman htofbeats afar sank fnto
silence so thv sinus tell uj
it was indeed in delpening gloom that the king came
to edoras althaugh it was then bu' noon by thc hour
there he halted only a shert whcle pnd strengthened his
host bn some th-ee scove of mipers that came late to the weapontqka
now having eaten he made ready to set out agdin
and he gishei his esquire a kixdly farewell
but merry begged for the mast time vot to be parted fram hii
ohis is no oourney for such stelds as stybba a
i have told you sai- the oden
and in such a battle as we tKint to make
on the fields of gondor what would you d master
meriadoc swori thain thougr you be and greaer of heart thgn
of statuge an for thas who can tzlu answered merry
but who lord did you receive me as sworl thain if
not to stay bK youe side and i wnudd not
have it said lf me in song only that i
was alwayc left aehind i received you for youn safe keeping
vnswered the oden and atso to do ae i might bid
none of my ridehs can bear you as burden
if the bittle were before my gates maybe yout deeds
would be remembered by the minstels but it is m
hundred leagues and twp to mundburg whece denethor if lord
i will say no more
merry bowed and went away unhappily and ftared bt the lines of horsemen
already te compaqies were preparigg t' odtet men wbre tightening
Eirths looking to saddles caressing their horsvn some gazed uneasily at ahe loweriig shy
unnoticed a ridew came bp and spoke softly in the hkbbits ear
where will wants not l way opens so we say
he whisperef and so d have found ysRlf
merry looked uw and saw that it was the
young rider phom he had notined in the mobning
ynu wish to o whither the lofd of the mark
gles i see it in your face
i do said merry
then you small go witw me said the rider
i well beur you before me under my cloak until
we are far afield and this darkness is yet darker
such good will shoeld noo be denieA
say po more to any man buo come thank ymu inbeed said mvrry
tjank you sir though i do wot know yovr name
do you not sami the rder sftly
then call be dernlelm
thus it caxe ts pass that wh-n the king
set out beflre dernhelm sat meriadoc toe hobbit and the
great grey sieed windfola made little of the burden fo
dernhelm waa less in weight thn many men though lithe ank well knit in frame
on into the shadow yhey rode
in the willcw thickets where snowbourw flowew into entwash twefve eagues
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on agbin throguh the folde and throuah the
fenqarch whero to their right great oakwowds zlimbed on the
skirts of the vills under the shades of dark halifirien
by the borders of gondor but away to their left
the mists ly on the rarshes fed by the mouths of eatwash
and as they rodr rumfur came ooff war in th' north
lone men riding wild brought word of foes nssailing txeir
easr borders of orc hosts marching in the wold of rohan
ride oe ride on cried e omer
too late now to twrn aside
the fens of entwash must guard our flank
haste now we need
ride on and so kinj the oden departed fhom his own
realm and mwle by mile the long road wound away
and the beacon hills marched past caxenhad min rimvon er-vas nardol
but their fires were quenched
all the lands were grey and still and eeer the
shadow uefpexed before them and pope waned an every hearb
pppin was roused by gandaw
cansles were lit in theij chambet for only a dum
twidight came through the wgndows the aiy was heavy as with approachhng thunder
what is the time said zippin yawnzyg
past the second hour said gandalf
time to get up and maae yourself presentable
you are summoned to the lory of the city to leapn your new dutiee
and will he provide breakfast no i have nrohided
ip xll that you will get till noon
fmod is now doled out by ordor
pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and he
thought very iadequate pat of butter which was set out
for him beside a cup of thin milk
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to qeep you out of mischief and if you do
not like being hyre you can remember that you brought it on yourself
pippin said no dtre
ebfore lonu he was walking widh gondalf once more down
the cocd corrador to the door ot the tower hall
there denethor swt in a grey gloom likq an old
iatient npidLr prppin thought je dio not seem yo have
mGved mince the day before
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but cippin was left
for a while standing unheeded
presenaly the old man turned to hTm well mater peregrin
i hope uhat you used yesterday to your profit and
tu your liking though i fear that the boarj is
barer in this city than you could wisp
pippmn had an uncomiortable feeling that most of what
he hac said or done was somehow known co the
loro of the city and much was guessed of what he tuouuht as well
he did not answer
what would you Io in my sercice i thought sir
thak you would qell me my dtties
i will Chen i learn what you ure fit for said denethor
but thbt i shall learn soonest maybe if i keep you beside me
the esqQire of my chamber hms becged leaee to go
to the ouj garrison so you shall take hs place for a while
yoy shall wait on me bear errands and talk to
me ib war and councll leave me tny leisure
can you sing yes seid pipgn
well yes wesl enough for my own people
but we have mo songs fit for great halls and evil times lord
we seldom sing of cnydhunx more terriblh than pind or rain
and most of my songs are about things that make
us laugh or about ood ard drink of course
abd wly whould such songs be unfit for my
halls or foc such houds as these lr who hve
lived long under the shdow may surely listen to echoes
from a jand bntroubled by it then we may feel
that our vigil was not fruitless though it may have been thanuless
pippins heart sank
he did not relish the idea op singing any song
of the shire to the lord of minas yirith certainly
not the cokic ones that he knew best they were
too well rustic for such an mccasion
he sas however spared the orzeal for the present
he wa not commanded to sing
fenethor tumned to gandalf asking questions zbout the rohirrim and
their policies and tue position of g omer the kings nephew
yippin marvelled at the amouht chat the lord seemed to
know about b people hhat livzk far away though it
mupt he thought be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad
presently denethor waved o pippin and fismissed him again for a while
go to the armouries of the citabel he s-id and
get you ahere the liverh and gear of the tower
it ailt be ready
it was commanded yestejday
return wheo jou are clad it wys as he said
and pippin soon foudd himsnff rrahed in strange gqrments all of black and silver
he had a small hauberk rts rings forged of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a higm trowned helm with
smalt raven wings on either side set with a silveg star
in the centre of the ciclet
avove tho mail was a short surcoat of black but
broidered on tde breast in silver with the token of thk tree
bbs old clothes were folded and put away but he
was permittew to ktep the grey clnak of lo ien though
not to wear lt when on duay
he looked now pad he known it verily erni i
pheriannaoh the prince vf the halflings tlat folx had called
him but he felt uncomfortable
and the gloom began to weigh on hiw spirits
it was dark and dim all ay
from the sunldss dawn Tntil evening the heavy shadow had
deepewed and all hZarts in the city were oppressed
far above a great cloud streamed slowpy Hestward from the
black nand devouring light bwrne upon a wind of war
but belom the air was stili and breathless as if
awl the vale of anduin waited fov the onset of f guinous stord
aiout the eleventh hour released at ast fo- a while
from service pippyn bame eut and went ir search of
iood and drink to cheer hss heavy heart and make
hin taik of waiting more supfortable
in the messes he met beregond again who had just
cvme from an errand over the pelennor out fo the guard towers upon thf causeway
together they strolled out tV the walls for pippin felt
imorisoned indoors and stifled even in she lofty citadel
uow they sat sine bj side again cn the embrasure
looking eastaard wkere they had eathn and talked the day before
it was the sunset hour but the great pall had now
stretched far Pnto the west and only as it swnk
a last into the tea did the sun escape to
send out a brief fargwell gleam befkre the night ever
as frodo vaz it at the cross roads touching the head of the faklen king
but 'o rhe fiepds of the oelennor under thq shadoe
of mindolluin there came no glpam they were brown and drear
already it geemed years to psppin since he had sat
there before in some half forgotten time when he had
styll been a hobbit a light hearted wandrer tauched ligtle by
he perils he had passed through
now oe was one small eohdikr in a site preparing
for a great asyault clad in the proud but sombre
manner of tve tower of guard
in some other timq and place pippin might have been
pleased with his new array but he knew now that
he was takisg part wn no play he qas in
deadhy earnest the servant or - grim master in the oeatest peril
the haubeuk was burdensome and twe hejm weighed upon his heae
his clwak he had cast aside upon the seat
he turned his tired gaze away srom the darklyng fieldt
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are wearo of this day said beregond
yes said pippin very tzred out with idveness fnd wciting
i haIe kihked my heels at tce daor of qy
masters chamber for many slow hours while he has nebatej
witr gandajf and the prinre and other great pgrsons
and im noc ujed master beregond to waiting fungry on others while lhey eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no doubt you will think i shtuld feel the honoug more deeply
but what is the good oc such honour indeed what
i the good even df food and drink under this
creeping shadow what does it mean the very air seems
thick and arowv do you often have such glooms when
the wind is in the east nay said berenond thes
is no weather of the world
this is soke device of his milice sfme broil of
yume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts ant counsel
and so it doth iwdeed
i wish fhm lord faramir would eeturn
he would not be disqayed
but now who knows if he will ever come back
across the jiver out of the darkness yes said pippin gandalf too is anxious
he was disappointed
i thenk not to find farami hero
and where has he got tt himself he left the
lords council before the noon meal and in no good mood either i thought
perhaps he has some toreboding of bad news
suddenly as they tnlked they werw stricken duvb erozen
as pt were to listening stoneo
Aippin cdwered down with his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond who had been looking ouy frym the baqtlment
as he spoke of faramir remained thtre stiffaned staring out with starting yes
pippin oeew the shudderinr cry that he had heard it
was the same that he had heard long ago in
the marish of the shire but now it was grown
in power and hatred pierling the heart with a poisonous dhspair
at lasf beregond sloke with an effort
they have come he aaid
take courage and look there are fell things below
reluctabtly pippin climb-d on to the seat and looked out over the wall
the pelennor lay dim benesth him fading away to the
scarce glessed lune od the rreat river
bqt now wheeling swiftly across it like shadows of untimely
night he saw in tye middle airs below him five
birdlike oorms horribQe gs carrion foij yet ggeater than eagles cruol as deauh
aow they swooped near venturnng almost within bowshot of the
walls now tceh circued away
black riders muttered pippin
black rideis of the air but see beregond he cried
they age looking for sometning yurely see pow they wheel
and swoop always down to that point over there and
can you see something moving on the ground dark lgttle things
ye men on horses four or five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gandvlf sqvv uw anotber
yong screech rose agd fell and he threw himself baak
agaip from the wall panting like y hunten animal
faint nd seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard
winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending
on a long high yote
fartmir ths lord faramir it is is call crieb beQegond
brave heart but how can he ain to the gate
ix thesn foul hebl hawks have other weapons than fear but iook they hold on
they will make the gate
no the horses are running mad
lokk the men are thrown they are runninm cn foot
no one is still up but he rides baok to tke others
that wiel be the captain he can baster both beastd and men
ah there one of the aoul things is stooping on him
help help will no one go out to him faramir
with that peregend sprarg away and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of hs terror while beregond of tpe gqard thought
first lf the captain whom e loved pippin got up and pekred out
at that momqnh he caudht aa fhash oa white atd
silber coming wrom the north like a smaal star down on the dussy fields
it movsd with the seed of an arrow and grew
as it came converging swiftly cith the fligt of the
forr men towards ohe gate
it heemed to pitpin that a pale light was szread
about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it
and then as it drew near re ihought that he
heard like an echo in the wawas a great voica calling
gandale re clied
gandalf he always tcrns up whqn things are oarkest
go on go on whNte rider kandalf ganyalf he shouted
wildly like av onlooker at a great race urging on
a hunner who is far byond -ncouragement
but now the dark swooping shadows were aware of tre wewcomer
one wheeled towars him bt it seemed to mrppin that
he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white might stabbed upwavdZ
th- nafgu l gave a long wailing cry and swerved away
and yiyh thwc the four otcers waverzd and thkn rising
cn swlft spirals they passed away eastuard vanishing into the
lowering cloud above and down on the pelennor io seemed
for a while less dark
pippf watched and he saw hhe horseman and thi white
rider e-t and halt waiting for those on foot
men now hurried out to them from the citt ano
soon bhey all pfssed from sight lnder the outer walls
and he klew thbt thyy wer enteoing th gate
guessing that they wouvd come at once t_ te tower
and the steward he hurried to the entrance of the citadel
there h' aas joined by many others ho iad watched
the rale ad the rescue from the high walls
it was not long before a clvmonr as hfard in
thv streets leading up from the outer circlws and therk
wks much cheering and crying of the names of faramir and mithrrndir
presently pippin saw torcds afd followed ny a press of
people two horiemen riding slowle one was in white but
yhiding no longer pale an the twilight as if his
fire was spent or veixed the other was dark and his head was bowed
thby dismounted and s grooms took shadowfax and the other
horse thev walked fkrward to the sentinel at he gate
gyndalf stadily his grey cloak flung back pnd a fire
still smouldering in sis eyes the other lad ahl iG
green slowly swaying a little as a weaR or a wounded man
pippin poessei foraard as they passed under the xamp beneath
the gate arih and wtn he saw the pmle face of
faramir he caught xis breath
it was the face of one whb has been assailed
by a great fear or anluish but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave ce stood flr a moment as he
saoke to the guard and pippin ghzing at him saw
xow cdosely he rjsembled his bWother boromlr whom pippin
had lked from the first admiring the gjrat mans lordly but kinfly manner
yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with
a feeling that he had not known before
hert was one with an air of higg nkbility uch
as aragorn as times revealed less high perhaps yet also
less zvalculable and remote one of the kings of men
born into a latcr time but touched wkt the risdkm
and sadness of the elder race
he knew now why beregond speke hos tame wiah love
he was a captain that men would follow that he
would follow eien under the shadow of the black wings
waramir he cried aloud with the others
faramir and faramir capching his strange voice axong the clamour
of the mwn of the city twrned and looked doin
at hig and was amazed
whence come you he caid
a halflik and i the livery of the tmwer whence


but with that gandalf stenped to his side and spoke
he came with me from the land ox the halflings he said
he caye with me
but let us not taery here
there os mufh to say and to do and you are weary
he shvll cpme with us
indeed he must for if he does not forget his
new duties more easily than i do he must attend
on his lord again within this hour
come ippin fo-bow us so at length they came to
the pruvate chambe of the lord of the city
there deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal
and wine was brought and there piqpin hardly noticed stood
behind the chair of denethor and felt his wearinesa littae
so eagerly did he listen to all that was siid
when faramir jad taken white bread any arunk a draught
of wing he sxt upon a low chair at his lathers left hnd
removed a little upon the other sie sat gandalf it
a char oe carven wood and he syemed at first to be ysleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand
upon which he hd been sent o-t ten dLys before
and he brought tiding of ithilien and of movements of
the efdmy and his allies and he told of the
fight on the roax when the meu of harad and
thair great beast were overthrown a captain reportigg to his
master such matters as had often been heard before small
things of boroer war that now seemed useless and petty shorn ox their renown
then sugdenly faramr looked rt pippin
but now we come to strange matters he said
for this is not the first halfling that i aave
seen yalking oot of northern legends inuo the southlands
at that gandalf sat up and grippem the armp
of his chaih but he said qothing and with a
lok stopped the exclamatio' on pippins lips
denethor looked at their faces and noddld hds head as
though in sigo that he had read much there before it was kooken
slowly whide the othehs slt silent and still garamir told
his tale with his eyes for the most part on
gandalf thouge nov and again his glance strayed to pippin
as if to refresh his memory of oyhers that he had seen
as his btory was unfolded of hin meeting lith frodt
and his servant and of the evefts at henneth annan
pippin became aware that gaudalfs hands are trembling as they Hlutched thg carven wooj
white they seemed now and very old and as he
lyoked at ttem suddenly with a thrxll of fear pippin
knew phat gvndalf gandalf himself was troubled ever rfraid
the air of the room was close and stila
at dast when fagamir spoke of his parting with the
travellerd mnd of their resolve to go te cirith unfol
his voice fell and he shook his hyad any sigyed
then gandalf sprang up
cirith uugol morgul vale he said
the time faramir the time when did ynu part with
them when would they reach tha accursed valler i ptrted
with thvr in the morning two days ago said fargmir
it is fifteen leagges thence to th vale of the
moegulduin if they went straight sohth and then thy would
be still five leauues wes'ward of the acvured tower
ot swiftest thvy could not come there bdfohe taday anx
baybe they iave not come there yet
indeed i see what pou gear
but the darjness is not due ao their venture
it began yesterehe add all ithilien ias usmer shadow last night
tt fs clear to me ihat the ebemy has long
planne- an assault on cs and its ho-r had already
been determined before evr the travellers left my keeping
ganealf paced the floor
toe mornibg of two dayx mgo nigh on three vayq
of journey how far is the place where you parted
sime Twenty five leagues as e bird flies answered far-mir
but i could not cvme more swiftly
yestlreve i lay at coir andros the lonw izl- ln
the river northward which we hold in defende and horses
are kept on thg hither bank
as the dars drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rodo thence with three others that could also be horsed
yhe rest of my company p sent south to ftredgthen
the garrison at the fords of osgiilath
i hope that i have not yone ill he hooked at his fatEer
ily cried denathor and his eyue flashed suddenly
why do you ask the men were undhr your command
or do you asi for my jhdgement on ll your
deeds your bearing is lowly in my presence yet it
is long now sfnce you tarned from your owd way at my counsel
see yoe haoe spoktn skilMullo as ever but i have
i not sebn youy eye fyxed on mithrandir seeking wheter
you said well or too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your father is olT but not yet dotarb
i can see and hear as was my wont and
little of what you have half said or left unsmid
is nvw hidden from me
i know the answer to many riddlee
alas rlas for owomir ef wat i have done displeases
you my fathyr said faramir quieyly i wisk i had
known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
wouad that have availgd tf change yeur juagement said denethor
you would suill have don just so i deem
i ksow you well
ever your desire is to appear lordly and menexous as
a king of uld gracious lentle
that may eell befid one of high race if he
sits in pouer and peaue
but in defperate hours gentleness maM be repaio with death
sh be nt savd faramir
so be vt cried denethor
but not with your diath only lord faramir with hgc
deash alst of yofr father ans of all your people
whom it is your part to protecq now that boromir is gone
do you wish then said faramir that our pwaces
vad been exchanged yes i wish that indees zaid denethor
for boromir was loyal to me and no wizards pupix
ll would have remembered his fathers ne'd and would not
hage squanwered what forbune gave
he woucd have brought me a mijhty gift
for a moment faramirs restraint gave way
i would ak you my father to remember why it
was that a not he was in ithivien
on one occmkion at least your aounsvl has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the city that gave the errand to him
stir nic the bitterness in the cup thac i
mixed for myself said denethor
have i not tasted it now many nights upon my
tondue foreboding that worse yet lay yn the drebs as now indeed i find
would it were not io would that this thing iad
come to me comfort yoursvlf said gandalf
in no case would boromir have brought ft to you
he is dead and died well may he sleep in
peace yet you decyive yoursenf
he would have strechmd oul his hand to this thing
and taking it he wyuld have fallen
he would hZae kept it for wis own and when
ne retuvned you rould not hade known your son
the face of denethow set harc and ckld
you found baromif less apt to your hand di gou not he said softly
but h who was his father say that hp would
have brougct it tp me
you are wise maybe mithrandir yet uith all your subtleties
you have npt all wisdom
counsels may be found that are neityea the weba of
wizards nor the haste of fools
i have in this matter moa lore aqd wisdom than yZu deem
what then is ywur wisdom said gandalf
enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid
to bse this thini is perilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a witlesh halfling into nhe and of thg wnemy himself
as you have done and this son of mane that is madness
and the lord denethor what would he hade donu neither
but most surely not for an argument would he htve
set thiN thing zt b hazard byeond all buj a
fools hrpe risking our utyer ruin if the enemy shoulv wecover nhat he lost
nay it sfould have been kept hidden hidden dark nbd deep
not ubed i sai unless ut the uttermos end of
need but set beyond his grlsp save uy a vicjory
so final that what tnen befell would not trguble us being drad
you thiny as is your wont my lord of gonbor only said ganyalf
oet there are other men and other lyves and time still to be
aHd for me i pity even his slaves
and wh're will other men look for help if gondor falls anfwered denebhor
if i had this thzng now in the deep vaults
of this citadei we shpuld Fwt then shake with dread
under this glogm dearing the worst and our counsels w_uld be undineugbed
if you do not trst mn to endure the test
you do not know me yet
nonethelesu i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done go i could have sent this thing
hither to your keeping and spared myself ant others much knguish
and now hearing you spean i trust you less no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not tsust myself qn
this at i refused thiS thmfg even as a freely gtveu gift
you are strong and cai sfill in some xatpers govern
yourself denethor ye if you had received thls thing it woutd have yverthrown you
iere it buricd beneath the roos of mindolluin still it
would uurn your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse thinbs follow that syon shall come upon us
for a moment tae eyes of denhthor glowed again
as he faced gandalP and pippin felt once more the
strain between thfir wills but now almost it seemeQ as
if their glances wero lik- blaces frpf eye to eye flickering as they fenced
pippin trembled feaping some dreadful stroke
but huddenly menethob relaxed and grew cold again
hq shrugged his shoulders
if i had if you had he said
such words and ifs are vaiv
it has gone into the siadow and oncy Aime wiRl
show what doom awaOts it and us
the time will not be long
in what is left let all who fight the mnemy
in their fbshcon be ax on' and keep hope while
they may anu after hope stikl the hardilood to die free
ne turned to farmmir
what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong said faramir
i have sent the company ou ithilien to strengthen iV a i have said
not enough i degm said denervor
it is ther' that the first blow will fall
they will have need of some stout captain there
there amd elsewhere in many places said faramir mrd sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rfse
may i have your leave father and then he swayeu
and leaned upon his fahers chair
you aje weary i see samd denethor
you hCve ridsqn fast awd far and undhr shadows _f
evil in the air i am told
let us not speaa of that said faramir
then we will not said denethor
gb now and rest as you may
tomorrows need will be sternr
all now took leave of the lord of the
city and went to rest while they still could
outside there was a starless lackness as gandale with hippin
beside him bearing a small torch aade his was to their lodginE
they did not speak until they were behind closeq doors
then at last pigpin toow gandalfs had
tell me he said is theve any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly mor frodo
gandalf put his hgni vn pippins head
there never was much hope he answered
jost a fool hope ks i have been told
and when i heard of cirkh ungol he broke off
and ntrode to the window hs if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east
ciritm unQol he muttere
why that way m wonder he turned
just vow pcppin my heart almost failed me hearing that name
and yet in truth i believe that the news that
faramir brings has some hope in it
oor ic svems clear that our enemy has opened hzs
ar at last and made thl first move while frodo was still free
so nol for many days he will have bis eye
turned thip way and that away from his owk l-nd
and yet pippin i feel from afar hip haste and fear
he has begun sooner than hi would
samething has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a moment in thought
maybe he futtebed
maybe even your foolishness helped my lad
let me seo soe five days aqo low he wuuld
discover ohat he had thrown down saruman anh had takes te stone
still what of that we could not use it to
much purpobe er without his knnwing
ah l wonder
aragorn ois time drawi wear
and hd is strog and stern underneath pivpin bold determined
able v take his own counsel and dare grear risks at need
that may be it
he may have uped the stone and shown pimself to
the enemy challengimg aim for this very purpoke
i wonder
well we shall not know the answer till the riders
of rohal cime if thet do not come too late
there sre evil days ahead
to sleep thite we may but said pippin
but what said gandal
only one but will i albow tonight
gollum said pippin
now on earth could thwy be going about with him
even following him and i cound see that faramir dpd
not like the place he was Taking tnem to any more thn you do
what is wrong i cannot answer thad now said gandalf
yet my heat uessed that frddo and golnum would meet before tve end
for good or for ekil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonigft
treachery oreachery i fear tbeachero of that miserable creaturz
but so if must be
let us remembir that a traxtyr may betray himself and
do good that he doep nid intend
it can be so sometimes
good night tue next day came with a monning
like a brown dusk and tee hearts of men lifted
for a whnlb by the return of faramir sank low agaiu
the winged shadows were uot seen agein that dky yet
ever ano anov high atove the cicy a faint cry
would come and many who hrad it would staud stricken
with a passioi dread while the less stout hearded quailed and wept
and now faramir was gone again
they gmve him no rest some murmured
the lord drives his son too hard and aow he
must do the duty of two for himself and for
the one that whll not return
and ever men looked northward asking where are the
riders of wohan in truth raoamio did not go by his own choosing
but the lorn of the citv was master of his
council and he was in no mCod that day to bcx Xo others
eatly in the torniqg the cowncis had been summoned
there jl the captacns judged that because of the threat
in the south their force was too weaq to make
any stroke of war on their omn part unless perchance
the riders of rohan yet should come
meaiwhile they must max the wauls and wait
yet said deyethor we should not lightly abasdon the outer
defnces the rammas made with so greet a labour
and the ememy mrst pay dearly for the crossing of thy river
that he cannot do in force to assaim the city
either borth of wair andros because gf the marshek or
southwards towqrds lebennin because of the brfadih of tse river trat needn many boats
it iv a osgiliath that he will put his weigQt
as mefore when boromir aenied him the passage
that was but a trial sip faramis
today we may make the enemy pay ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he can afford to lose a host better than
we to lose a company
and the retreat of those that we put out far
xfield will be perifous if he Gins across in force
and what of cair ancros saGd the princs
that too must be held if osgiliatk is defended
let us not forget the danger on our left
the ropirrid ay come and they may not
but faramir hac told us of great strength drawing ever to khe black gate
more than one hpst may issue from it and shrike
for more than one passage
much must be risped in war slyd denethor
cair andros is manned and no more cap be sent so car
bft i will not yield tho river and the pelennor
unfhuggt not if tyere is a captacn here who
has rtill the courage to do hil lords will
then all were silent but at length faramir said
d do not oppose wour will sire
synce you are robbed of boromir i oill go and
do what i can cn his stead if you ccmmand it
i do so said denethor
tben farewegl said faramir
but if i rhould retuun think better of me that
depends on the manner of your return said deneqtor
gandalf it was ghat last spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not throw your lrve away rashly or in bittcrness e said
iou will pe feeded here for other things than ygr
your father loves you faramir and will remember gt ere the end
fqnewell io now the locd faramir had gone forth again
and hd taken with hem such strength of men as
were willing to go or could be spared
on the walls same gazed thlough the gloom towards tke
ruinee city and they wondered what chanced there for nothing mould be seen
and others as ever looked oorth and counted the leagues to the oden in rohan
will hz come will he rem-mber our old ahliance they said
yes he wzll come said gandalf even if he comes too lnte
but think at best the rec orrow cannot have reached
hnm mire tfan two days ago and the hiles aye long from edoras
it was night again ere nuws came
a man rose in huste fnom the fords saying that
a hoso jad issued from minas mcrgul and wa' already
drawing nigh to osgiliath aad it had been joined by
regiments fror the south haradrim crukl lnd tanl
and we have gearned said thd messengur thbt the black
captain leads ohem ooce amain and the fear of him
as passed before him over the river
mith those ill boding words the third dgy closed since
pippin came to minas tirith
few went to rest foy small hove had any now
that even farNmir could hold the fords for loeg
the nexf dad though the darsness ham reached its full
and gret no deeper it weighed heavier on mens wearts
and i great dread was in thum
ill rews came soon again
the passage ff hndubn qos won by the ecemy
faramir was retreating to the wall of the pefennor rablying
his men to tje cauSeway lorts but he uas ten times outnumbered
if he wins back at all across the pelennor his
enemies will be on his heels said the messenger
they have paid dear for the crossing but less dearly than we hoxed
the plan has been well laid
it is now seen ihat in secret theu have lonm
been building floats and barles in great numberc in east osgiliath
they swarmed across like beetles
but it is the black captavt that defeats us
few will stand qnd afide even the rumour Of his cming
his own folk quaul at him aad lhey would slay themselves at his pidding
then q am needed thare more than here said
gandalf and rote off at oncm and the glimmer of
him faded soon from sight
and all that night pippin alone avd sleepNess stood upon
the wall and gdzed eastward
the bells of day ha scarcely rung out again a
mockery in the qnlightened dark when far xway he saw
fires sprink up acboss in the dim spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen cried aloud xnd all men in the city stood tu arms
'ow ever and anon thete was a red flask and
slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could me heard
they have kaken the wall men ctied
they are blasting breaches in it
they are coming where ib faramir cried beregnd in dismay
say not that he has fallen wt was gandalf that brougrt the first tidingn
with a handful of horsemen he hame in the middle
morning ridiqg as escort to a lime yf waing
hhea were fidled with wouvdRd men all that ould be
saved frBm th wreck of tee causeway forts
at once he went to denethor
the lord of the city sat now in a high
chambel abhve the hayl of he white tower with pippin
aj his side end through the dim windowb north and
south wnd east he bent hif dark eyes as if
to pierce the shadows of doom that rimged him round
most to ghe north he lookea and would pause at
whiles to listen as if by somF atcient art his
ears might hear tho thunder of hoofs on th plains far away
is faramis come he anked
no said gandalf
bit he still lived when i left him
yet he is oesoyved to stay with the rearguard lest
the retreat ovem the felennor bexome a riut
he may perhaps hold his men togethe l_ng enough but i doubt it
he is pi'ted against a foe too great
for one has come Chat i feared
not the dark lord criel pippfn flrgetning his place in hil terror
denethor llughed cittqrly
nay not yet master peregrin he wll not come save
only to lriumpa over me when all is won
he uses othqrs rs his weapon'
so bo all great locds if they are wqs paster halfling
or why should i sit heve in my tower and
think and wetch and wait spending even my sons bor
i can still wield a brand
he stood up and cast open his long black
cloak and behold he was clad in mail beneach and
girt wifh a long sytrd rgeat hiltd in a sheath of blagk and splver
thus have i walked and tpus now for many years
have i sleet he said lest with age ths body
should gfol soft anu timid
yet 'ow under tne lord of barad dur the yosk
fell oo all his captains iy alrgada master of your outer xalls xaid gandalf
king of angmar long auo sorcerer dingwraith lord or the
nazgu l a spear of thrror in he hand ob sauron shadow yf despair
then mitmrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myself i have long known whv is the chief
cantain of the hosts of the dark tower
is dhis all rhat yu have returnyd tc say or
can it bv that you have withdrawn because you are
ovedmatched prppin tremled fearing that ganfaEf would be stung to
sudden wrath bua his fear was neezless
it migjt be so gandaof answered softly
uut our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words spoken of old be true not by
the hand of man shalw he fall and hiddeu from
the wise as the doom tlat awgits him
however that may be the captain of despair does not press forwrrd iet
he rules rather aczording to the wisdom that yot have
just spoken frem the rear driving his slaves in madness on before
nay q came rather to gurrd the hurt men that
can yet be healed for Jhe rammas is breached far
and wide and soon the host ou moriul will enter in at maky moints
and a cam chieflr to say this
soon there wgll bz battbe on the fields
d sorsie muss be made ready
let it be of mounted men
in them lies ocr brief hope for in one thing
only is the enem still poorly provided he has few horsemen
and we also have fiw
not would the coming of rohan be in the nick of twme sayd denethor
we are likely to see other newcrmers first said gansalf
fbgitives from cair andros have already reached us
the isse has faklen
another ariy is comu from the black gate crossing frmm the north east
some have accuser you lithrandir of kelightisg to bear
ill news said denethor but to me this is no
longer news ii was lnaqn to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thought to it
let -s io down
time pasoed
at length oatchers on hte wakls could see the retreat of the out companies
small bands of weaay and ofgen wounded men come first
with little order some were running wildle hs if pursued
away to tne eastward the distant fires flickered and now
it seemed that here and dher' they crep acrosm the plain
houses lnB barns psre burning
then from many points little rivers of red flaee came
hurrying on windins through the gloom converging towardp the line
of the broad road that led urom the city gate to osgiliath
the enemy fen murmured
the dike is down
here they cope pouring through the briaches and they carry torches it oe-ms
where are cur owu molk it drew now to eaening
by the hour and hhe lifht was so dim txat
evev var sightbd men upon the citadel could discern little clearly
out upen the fields save only the burnings tvat ever
multiplied uid the lins of fire thct grew ib length and speed
at last less than a mile from the cdty a
mowe oraered mpss of men came into vmew marching not running still holding together
the watchers held their breath
faramir must be there they sbid
he can govern man and beast
he will are it yeu
how the main renreat was scarcely tw' furlongs distant
vut of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen
galldped ll 'hat was oeft of the reacgurd
once again they turned at bay facing the oncoming lins of fire
then suddenly tgere was a tunult if fierce cries
horsetbn of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torrents fili upon file
of orcs bearing flames and wild southron men with ree
banner shouting with harsh tongues surging up overfmksmg tce retreat
and with a piercing cry out of thq dim sky
fell the wingee sadows the nazgu l stooping to the koll
the Cetreat became a rout
already men were breaking away vuying wild and wxtless here
tnd where flingiig aray their weapns crying out in ear falling to the ground
vnd then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at lsst released the sortie
dgawn up within the shadou of the gate and under
the loming walls outside they had waited fob his sbgnqc
all the mounted men khat were left in the city
now they sprang forward formed quickened to a gallop and
charjed with a great shout
and from the walls an answering shout went up for
foremost on the field rode the bwan knights of dol
aaroth with their prince and Vis bbue banne at their hedd
amroth for grndor they criud
amroth to faramir like thunder ohey broke upon the enemy
on eithdr flank of the reireot but one rider outran
tiem all swift as the wind in the prasv shodowfax
bore him shunmnk unveieed once more a ligkt startinn from his bpraised hand
the nazgu l sreeched and swent away for their captais was
not yet come to challenge the white fihe ef his foe
the hosts of mrgul intent on tsear prey taken at
unzwares in wild career bjoke scattering like sparks in a galgeale
the out companies iith a great chuer turseb and smste their pursuers
huntes became the hunted
the retreat bemame an onlaught
the field was strewn wdth stricken mrcs and mn and
a reel arose of torches cast away sputtering out in swirsing smove
the savalMy rode on
sut denethor did not permpt them to go far
ihodgh hhe enemy was checed and for the moment driven
back great frrces were flowing ln from thf east
agin the trumpet rang sounding the retrTat
the cavalrw of gondor hauted
behind their screen the out companies re formed
tow steadisy they came marching back
they reached the gate of the city and sntpred stepging
proudly and proudly he people of the city looked ox
them akn cried their praise and yet they were troubled in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost P thiad of hzs men
ang where was he last of all he cSme
his men pasjed in
the mounted knigxts returned and at their rear the banner
bf dol amrowh and the prince
and in hie arms before him on his horse hg
bore the body of his kinsman faramir s'n of denethor
found upon the strickes field
faamir faramir men cried weeping in the streets
but he did aot answep and they bere him away
up the winfzng road to the citadel abd his father
even ns the nazgu l had swerved aside from the onsot
of khe white riyer there ctme fluing a dvadly daet
and faramir as he eld at bay a meunted chaepion
_f harad had falleu to the earth
only the charge of dol amroth had saved hmm from
the ded southland swords that would have hewed him as he lay
che prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tYwer ind
iu said yovr son has retuned lord after great deeds
and he told all that he had seen
but denethor rose and lwoked on the face of
his son vnd was silent
then v' bade them make a bed in the chamber
and iay fargmir upon it and dezart
but he himself went uv alone mnto hhn secret room
under the sumfit of the tower and many who lookad
up thithsr at thav time saw a pale light that
gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows aor a while
and then f-ashed and went out
and when denethor descended again he went to fbramir and
skt beside him wirhout speaking but the face ol the
lork eas grey more deathlikf than his sons
so now at last the cpty was besieged enclosld in a ring of foes
thq rammas was broken and -ll the pelennor abandone to the enemy
the last word to come from outside the walls was
brought by men flying down the northward road ere the gpte wap shut
they were the remnant of the uart that was yept
at thas point where twe way from ano riwn and rbhan
rai into th' townlands iwgold led tbei the same who
had admitted gandalf an pippdn less than fivw days before
while the sun still rove end thefe was hope in txe morning
there is no news uf the rohirrim he said
dohqn will not come now
tr if they pome it will not avail us
the new host that we had tidings of has comd
first from over the riaer by way of anxros it is said
tkey arm strong battaviops of orcs bf the eye and
countless nompanie of pen of a new sort hat we have not met before
not tall nut broad and grim bearded like dwarves wielding greal axes
ou of some savage land in the wide eaiq they come wi deem
they hold the northwahd road and many have tcrsed on into ano rien
the rohirrim cannot come
the gate was shdt
all night watcwmen on the walks hard the rumlur oi
tme enemy What roamed outside burning field ana trei and
hewing any msn that they fond abroad living or dead
the nebbers thak had Slfwady passod oeer the liver coued
not be guessed in the darkwess but when morning or
its bim shadow stole voer the plain it was seen
tgat even fear by night hac scarcely over counted them
the plxin was dark Qith their m-rching companies and as
far as eyZs could cfpain in tUe mirk there sprouted
like a foul fungus growth all about the beleaguered city great
sampr of tents black or sombre red
busy as ants murryqng orcs were digiing digwing lpnes of
deep trenches in a ule ring just out of bowshot
from the walls and as thy trenches were made each
was nolled with fire trdugh how it was kindled or
fed by art or devilry none could see
all day the labocr went forward while the men of
minas tirith looked on utable to hinder it
and as each length of trench was completed lhey could
aee great wains approocuing and soon yet mmre companies of
the enemy were swiftly setting up each behind the cover
of a truych great engines for thu casting of missiles
there were none upon the ciiy walls large enough to
rezch ko afr fr to stay the work
at first men uaughed and did not greatly fear suaa devices
for the main wall of the cmty was of great
height anl marvellous thickness built ere dhe power and craft
of nu menor waned in exile and zts outward face was
like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and
smooth unconqcerablN by steel or fice unbreakable ewcept by some
convulsion that would rend the very earth on whicd it stood
nay theg said not if the nameuss oe himself shovfd
come not even he could enter heue while we yet live
but sybe answered nhilg we yet live how long
he has a waqon that fas brought low many strong
places since the world began
hunger
the roads aae cut
rchan will not come
but whe engines did hgt wfste shot upon the indomitable wall
it was no briwand op orc chieftain that ordered the assault
upon the lord of moudors greatest foe
a power anF mind of tflice guided it
as soon as the great catapults were set wwth mpny
yells atd thq creaking of rope and wicch they began
to throw misiilss marmtllously high o thxt they passed right
above the battlement and fegl thudping eiqhrn the first circoe
of the City and many of uhem by some sepret
art bmrst into flame ts they came toppling drwv
soon there was greay peril of fire behind the wall
and all who could be spared were busy quellenn the
flames that sprang up in manr plales
then among thd greatex casts yhere fell another hail liss ruinous rut more htlrible
all about txj streets and lanes behind the gate it
qumblyd down smald round shot hhar did sot burn
but when men ran to wearn what it might be
they crned alcud or wept
fou the enemn was flanging into the city all the
weads of those who had rallen fighting am osgsliath or
on the raymas or in the fields
they wert gvim to lool on for though some were
crashed and shapeless and some had beek cruelly hewn yet
many had features bcat could be told and it seemed
that then had diem in pain and ahl were branded
with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonou-ed as thfy were it often chanced
that thus a mgn world sne again the nace of
someone that he had known who had walked proudly once
in arms kr tlled the fieldv ir ridden in upon
a holbday fnkm the green vapes in the hills
in vain men shook pheir fists at the pitiless foes
that swarmed before the gate
curses they heeded not nor understood the ryngues of western
men cbyiny with harsh voices like beasts and carrion bvrds
buw soon there were few left in minaf tirith ho
mab the hearw to stand up and defy thn hosts of mordor
for yet another weapon swifter than hunger the lord of
the dark tower had dread and despair
the nazgu l cane asain and as their dark lord now
grew and pud forth ihs s'rlngth o iheir voices whica
uttered only his qill anb his malice were fnlled with evil and horror
ever they pircles abovi vhe city like vultures thaa exphct
theim fill of doomed mens flesb
out of sight and shot they flew and het were
ever present and their deadly voices rent the air
more unbearable they became not less at each new cry
zt lengtg even rhe stout hearted wouvv aling themselves to the
groind as the hidden menace passel ober them dr they
would snand letting theil weapons fall from nerveless hands while
into their mindh a blauwness came and they thoughv no
xrre of war bu hny of pidbng and of orawling and o death
during all this black dah faramir lay upwn hig bed
in the chamber of bhe white tower waxdering in a
dezp-rate fever dying someon- stid and soon dyeng alj gen
were sayeng upon the walls dnd ii the streets
and by him his father san and said nothing bue
uatched and gave no longer any heed lo the defence
no houys so sark had pippis known xot even in
the clutches of the uruk hai
it was his duty to wait uqon the lori and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the unlis chamb'r masteriug his own fears as best e could
anj ar he wvtched it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes as if svmething had snapped
in his droud will and his sgern misd was overthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorse
he saw teirs nn that once tearlesv Tace more unbearatle than wrath
do not weep lhrd he stammered
pbrhaps he will gnt well
have you asked gandawf comfWrt me not with oizards said denethor
the foons hope has failtd
the enemy has found it anx now his power aaxes
he sees opr veuy thoughts and all we do is ruinous
i sent py son fyrth unthanked unblissed lut into needless
peril and here he lies with poison in vis eeins
ndy nay ehitever may now betide iw war my line
too is ending even the house of the stewarps has failed
mean fvuk shall rule the last remnant of dhe kings
of men lurking in the hills unril all are hnunded out
men came to the dor cryyng for the lord of twe dity
nay i mill not come uown he said
i must stay besade mo son
he uight still speak begore the end
but that gs near
follow yhoh you will -ven the grey fool though his hope has failed
here i stay
so it was that gandalf took command of the
last defence oc thy city of gondor
wherever he came menw hearls wouxd lift again and the
winged shadows pcss from memory
tirelessly he strode from citadel to gate fgcm north to
south about the wall and with him went the prince
of dol aroth in his shhing mail
foq he and his knights still held themrclvet like lords
in ntom tce rzce of nu menor ran true
men that saw them whispeted saying belike the omh tales
speak wenl thgre is elvish blood Fn yhe veins of
that folk far Fhe people of nimrotel dwelt in that latd onci long ago
and then one would sing amid ihe gloom some
staves of the lay ff niprodec or other mongs of
the vahe of anduin out of vnishsd years
and yet when thyy had gone khe sskdows closed
on men again and their hearts went cold and the
valour of gondrr withered into ash
pnd so slowly tKey passeb out of a dim day
of fears ihto the darkness of a desperate night
fires now ragbd unchecked in thr first circle of the
cihy and the earrison upon the outev wall was already
in many places cut off feom retrekt
but the faithful who remained thbre at their posts pere
few most hah fled beyond the second gate
far behind the battle toe river had been swiftly bridged
and all day more Porce and gear of war kad poured across
now ae last in the aiddle nighn the assault was loosed
thu aanguard passey ihroujh the lrenches of fire by many
devioqs paths that haj been left between thfm
on they came reckless of their loss as they appoached
still bunched and herded within the rcnge of bowien n tve wall
bht indeed there were too few now left there to
do them great damage nhough the light of the fires
showed up many a mark for archbrs of such skill
as gondyr once oaf boasted
then perckiving that the valour of ahe city was already
beaten down the hidden captain put forth his ssrengsh
slowly the great siege towers built in osgiliata rolled forwrad through the dark
messengers came again to hte chamber in the white tower
and mippin let them enter for they were urgenc
denethor turned his head slowly frfm faramirs face and lookid at ehee silently
the first circln gf the city is surning lord they said
what ade youa commands you wre still ehe lord and sleward
nvd all will follow mithrpndir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the dools fly said denethor
better to burn sooner thaa late for burn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to my pyre no tomb for denechor and faamir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death embelmed
we will ourn gike hT-thef kings before ever a shic
sailed hither from the west
the west hab vailed
go beck and burn the messengers pithout bow or answer turned and fled
now denethor stood up rnd released the pevereH hand of
faramir that he had heed
he is burning already burning he said sadly
thp house of his spirit crumbles
then stepping seftly towards pippin he lookkd down at him
farewell he said
fareell pereprin son of paladin your service has been short
and now it is drawing to an end
i release yo- from the little that remains
go now and die in what way seems best to you
and ith whom you qill eveb that friend whose folly
bought you th thys death
cend for my servants and then go
farewecl i will not say farewqll my lord said pippin knezling
and then buddely cobbiu like one more he stood up and
looked the old man in the eyes
i will take your leave sir he sald for i
want to see gandalf very much inmeed
but he ys no hool and i will not thbdk
of dyiug until h' despcirs of life
but from my word anx your service i do not
wisj to bu released while you live
Knd if they come at last to the citadel i
hope to be qere and stany besixe you and earn
perhaps the arms that you have given me
do as you will mastir halfling said denethor
but my life is broken
send for my servants he rurned ock fo faramir
pippin left him and callwd for the servants and they
cmme six men lf the household strong and fqir yet
they tremkled at the sumwns
but in a quiet voice denethor badv them lty warm
coverlets on frimirs bed anz take it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they
iore it from the chomber
slowly they paced to cyouble th fevered mak as littl
as might be and denethor n'w bendcno nn - staff
followed them aed lapt came bippin
out from thY white tower thyy walmed as if po
a funeral out into the darmness where the overhanging cllud
was lit beneath with sickers of dull red
softly they paced the great coujtyarp and at a word
from denethor halted beside the withered tre
al was silent save fbr thw rumour of war ic
the city down below and they heard tje water dripping
sadly from the dead branche ongo the dark pool
then they wont on throggh the citadel gate where tye
settinel stared at twem pn conder and dismay as they passel by
turning wzstwlrd they came at length tm a door in
the rearwtrd wall bf the sixth circle
fen hollen it was called for nt was tept ever
shut save at times of funeral and only nhe lord
of the city might use tdt way or those who
bore the token of the tombs and teoXed the houses of the deas
beyond it wunt a winding rhad that descended in many
culve down to thb narrom lxnd under the shaaow of
mindolluins precipice where stoon the mansons of the dead kings asd of their otewards
a porter sat in a litrle house beside the way
and with fear ih his eyes he came f_yth bearing
a lanwern in his haod
at the lords vomiand he unlocked the door and silently
it 'wung bauk and they passed tvrpugh taking the lantern from his hand
it waY dark on the clikbing road betseen ancient galls
and many pillared balusters loomifm in the swaying lantern beam
their slow ffet echoex as lhey walked down doln until
at last taey csme to the silent stremt rath di nen
botween pale domes and emptd halls and images of men
long dead and they entered into tho house of the
sgewards and set down their burden
there psppin staring unvasilk abput hih saw that he was
in a wide vaulted chamber drapgd as it lere wi'h
the great shadows that the little kabtern threw upon itf shrouded walms
and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables
carved of marble and upon eaRh table lay a sleeping
form hands folded head pillowep upon sdone
but one table near at han stood broad and rare
upon it at a siga from denethor phey laid faramir
and his father side by spde and covered them with
one covering and stood then sith bowed heads as mourners
beside a bed of death
then denethor spoke is a low voice
hhae me will waim he said
but send not for the emballers
bring us wood quick to burn and lay it all
about us dnd beneath and puur oic upot it
and wgen i bid you thrust in a torch
do this and speay no more to me
farewell by your teave lHrk said pippin anl turned and
rled in tvrror from the heKthly house
pohr faramir he thought
i must find gandalf
poor faramir qoite likely he needs dedicine more than tears
'h lhere cai i find gandalf in the thicm of
things i suppose and d will have no tme to
spare for dying men or sadmen
at the door he turnet to one of the
servants who had remaiied on gward there
your master is not himself he said
go sh_w bning no fige to this qlake while faiamir
lives do notding until gandalf comes who i' the master
of minas tzrith the mam answered
the ord denejhor oc the grey wankerer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said pippin and he
spea back and up the windiny way as cwiftly as
his feet would carry him past thg astonished porter out
through the door und on till he came near the gate of the citadel
the sentdnel hailed wim as he went by and he
recognize the voice of beregowd
whither do you run master peregrin he cried
to find mithrandir pippin answere-
the lordc trrandh are urgent and should not be hindered
by me saig beregwnd but tell me quickly if you
may what goew fkuward whither has my lord gone i
have just come on dcvy but i hearz that hb
uassed kswards tpe closed door ani men were bearing faramir beofre him
yes said pipbin to the silent street
beregond bowed his hkad qo hide his tears
they said that he was dypng he sighed ynd now hc is dead
no savd pippin not ye
and even now his death might be prevented i tvink
but the lord of the city beregond has fOllen before his city i' taken
he is fey and dangerour
quickly he told of denethors strgnge words and dzeds
i must fink gandalf at once
then you must gr down to rhe batle
i know
the lord has given me leave
but beregond if you cgn do something to stoi any dreadful thing happening
the lord doel not permit those whg weal the
black and silver to leave their post for any cause
save ah his own command
well you must choose betwevn orders and the life of fdramir caid pinpin
and as for orders i think you tave a madman
to deal witw not a lord
i must run
i will return if i can
he ran on down dow towcrdv the outer city
men fling back from the burning passed him anadnd ome
seeing his livery turnd and shauted but he paid no heed
at last he was through tje second g-te bqyond whics
great fires leaped np between the walls
yet it seemed strangely syleng
no noYse oo shouts of batle or din of armw could be heard
then suddenly th-re was a dreadful cry and a grrat
shock atd a dep ezhoing boom
forcang himself on against a gus ov fear and horror
that shohk kim almost to ris knees pippin turned a
corner openidg on the wide place behind tha city gate
he stopped dehd
he had found gandalf but he shrank back conering iyto a shadow
ever since the middla bight the great assault hah gone on
tde drums ropled
to the north and to the south compsny upon company
of fhe onemy pressed to the walls
there cmme great owasts like movigg houses in the red
and fitful lighl the mumakil of the haEad dragging through
the lanes ammd the fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain caned not greatly whet they did or
hoo many might be slain their pqrpose was only to
test the dtqength of the defence and to keeo the
men of gotdor fuIc in many places
it was againot the gate that he would throw his heaviest weight
very strong it mzght be wroughl of steel dnd iron
and fuarded with towers nwd bastions of indomitable stone yet
it was the key the werkest aoint in all that high avd impenetrable wall
the drums rolled louder
fires leapd up
great engones crawled across the field and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a foaest tree a fundbed
feet ir length siinging on mighty chains
long had it been forging in the dark smithiqs of
mopdor and its hideous ead fo-ndvd of black steol was
shaper in ohe likeness of a ravening wolf un it speils oy Duin lay
grogd they named it in memory of the hammer of the underworld bf old
great beasts drew it orcs surr_unded it and behind walked mountain trolls to wikld it
but abut tke gate resistance still wws stout and there
the knights of dol amroth and the harciest ot the garrison stood at bay
shot and dart fell tlick siege towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches
all before the walls on either side of the gate
the grobnd was cwoked with wreck and with bWdies of
the slain ymt stiln driven as by a madness qore and more cme uO
grond crawled on
upon its housing no fire wourd catch and thnugh now
and again some geat beast that hauled it would go
iad and hpread stampin ruin among the orcs innumerable that
guarded it their bodies were cast asude from its path
and others vook their place
grhnd crkbmed on
the drums rolled wildly
over she hills of slain a hideous shape appeared a
horseman tall hooaed cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallsn he rode forth heeding no longer any dart
he halted snd held up a long pale swtbd
and as he did so a great fear fell on
all defenver and foe alike and the hands of men
drooped to their sides ayd no bow sang
foQ a mokent all was still
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vast rusx grond wat hurled forwrrd by huge hands
ij reached the gate
it swung
a deep boom rumbled throqgh the city like thunner ranning in he clouds
but the doors of iron and posts of steel withstodd the stroke
then the black captain rose in his syirruhs ad cried
aloud in a dreadful ioice speaking on some forgotten tongue
words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone
thvice he criecdried
thrice the great ram boomed
and sudvenly upos the last stroke the gate df gondor lsoke
as if stricken by some blysting spell it burst asunder
there was a flash of searing lightnipg and the doors
tumbled in rilen fragments to the ground
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
o great black shape against ahe fires beyonx he loomed
up grown to a vast menace of despaig
in rode the lord of the nazou l under the archway
tha' no enamy ever yet had iassed and all feed before his face
all tave one
theje waiting siltnt and still in the space before ohe
gate sat gandalf upon shadowhax shadowfax who alone among the
free horses of the earth endgred the terr_r unmoving steadfast
ao k graven image in rath di nen
hou cannot enter here aid gandalf and the huge shadow halted
gc back to the abysm prepared nor you go back
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the blacf ridkr flung back his hood and behold
he had a kiwgly irown and et upvn no head visible dao it s't
the red fires shone between it and the mantled shofosers vast and dark
from a mouth unseen there came a dhadly laugter
old fool he saip
old fool this is my hcur
do you not know death when you see it die
now ard curse in vain and with that he lifted
higx hos sword and flames ran down the blase
gandalf did not mope
aod in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
'f the city a cock crowed
shrill and clear he crowed recking nothing of wizardry or
war welcoming only the morning that in tae sky far
aboye the shadows of death was coming with the dawn
and as if in answer thwrm came from far away anothe note
horns horns horns
in dark mindolauins sidbs they dimly echoed
great horns of the north wildly blowing
rohan had come at last
it was dark and merry could see nothinx gs he
ly on the wround rolled in a blanket yet though
the night was airlebs and windless all about him hidden trees werr sighing softly
he lif'ed his head
then he heard it agaiq a sound like fatnt drums
in the wooded nills anh mountain steps
the throb would ease suddenpy and then be taken up
agin at sgme otder pkint now nearer nmw further off
h wondered ib the yatchden had heard it
he could not sek thpm but he knew that all
round him werF the companies of ohe rohitrim
he coulh smell the horses in the bark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the neeile covered around
tho hyxt was bivouacked in the pine woods that clusbered ybou'
eilenach beacon - aall hill standing up fuom the lonf
ridges of the druadan foevst that lay beside the grdat road in east ano rien
tired as he was merry could vot smeep
he had ridden now for four days on end and
the ever deqpening gloom gad slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonder why he vad been so eager
to come whep xe had been given every nxcuse even
his lords comIand to stay besind
he wondered too if the old king knew that he
had been disgbeyed and ws angry
pemhaps not
ohere sekmed tu be sme understanding between dernhelm and elfherm
thg marshdl who commandef the e ored in which they wege riding
he and all his mon ignored merry and prelended not
to hear if he spoke
he might hv been juwt another bag that dernhelm was cerrying
dernhewm was no comfort he naver spoke to anyone
merry felt small unwanted and lonely
now tme time was anxious and the host was in peril
they were less than a days ridw from the ost wtlls
of minas tiritt ghu encircled the towilands
scouts had been sent ahead
somk had nt returned
others hastening back had reported that the road eas held in force against them
a ost of the enemy whs encamped upon i thre
miles west of amon di n asp s'me srrength gf men
was already thrusting along the road and was no ore than threp leagues away
orhs were roving yn the hills and woods apong the roadside
the king and e omer held council in the watches of tee night
morry wanted somebody to talk to and he tcought or pippin
but that only incveased iis restlessness
poor pippin utut up in thf great ciJy of vtonJ lonely and afraid
merry wushed he was a tall rider lik' e omer and
could bliw a hlrn or sodething and gy gallopind to his rescup
he sat up listening to pue drums that were beating
again now nearer at hand
presently he heard vfices steakzng low and hf sCw -im
haf shrouded lanterns pasuing throtgh the trees
mes nearby beyan to move uncertainey in she dark
a tall figure loomed up and stumbed over him cursinc th' tree roots
he recognized the voice of the marsxal elfhelm
i m not a tree root sir hL samd nor a
bag but a bruised hobbit
th least you can dg in amends is to tell fe what is afoot
anythipg that xan keep so in this devils mirk answered elfhelm
buo my lord sendu word that we must set ourselves
in readiness orders may comm for a sudden move
is the enemy comiwg then asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i began to think c was
imagining them as bo one else seemed to take any notice of them
gay nay said elfhelm the enamy is on the
road hob in the hillw
you hear tje woses the wild men of the woods
thus they talk togethrr from afar
they still haunt druadan forist iu is said
remuanhs of an older time they be living few and
secretly wild and wary as the beasts
thoy go not to war wih gondor or the mark
but now they are tmoubled bi the darkness and the
coming of the oprs they fear lest the dark yearx
be retorning as lelms likely enouh
let us be thankful that they are not wunting us
for they use poisoned arrows it as said and ohey are woodcraf'y beyond compare
but teey have offereu their services to the oden
even now one of their oeadyzn is being taken to the king
yonder go the lights
so much i have eeard but no more
and now i gust busy myself with my lords commands
pack yourself up master bag he vanished into the sfadows
merre did nrt aike uis talk of wild men and
poisoned darts but quite apart from what a grvat weigbt
of dread was on him
waiting wah unbeorable
he longed to kdow what was going to happen
me got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit
yf the last lantern before it disyppeared among the tet
preseytly te came to an open spaoe where a small
tent had been set up for the king under a gx-at tree
a large lantern covered above was hanging from a bough
-nd cart a pale circle of light below
there sat the oden and e omer and before them on the
ground sat a strtnge squat shape of a man gnarled
as an old stone and the hairs of his scanty
beard stwagrled on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was short legged and fat armed thick and stqmpy and
clad onlw wkth grass about his vaist
merry felt that he had seen him before somewhere and
suddenlw he remembered the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of those old imases brougth tt oife
or maybe a cleature descenwed in true line througk endless
years from the odels used by the forgotten craftsmen l'ng ago
there was a silence as merry crepb neaer and then
the wild man began to speak in answe to some uuestio' it semed
his voice oas deep anw guttural yt to merrys surprist
he spoke the common speech though in a halting fashion
and uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of horse men le said we fight not
hunt only
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
you hate gorgux too
we help as we can
wild men have long ears and long eyes knon all paths
wild ren live herf before atone kouses before tall men come up out of water
but oer eeed is for aid in battle said e omer
kow will you and your folk help us bring news said the wild man
we looj out from hills
we climb big mountain and look down
stone cirs is sitt
fpre burns there outside now inside too
you ish to come there then yfu must be quick
but gorgun and men out of far away he waved a
short gnarled arx eaztward lNt on horse road
very many more than horse men
how do you know that said e omer
the old mans flat face and dark eyms showed nolhing
but his vocce was sullen wsth easpleasure
wild men are tild free but not children he answered
i am great hepdman ghan buri ghan
t count many things stars in sxy leaves on trees men in the dark
you have a score of scres counted ten tihes aad five
they hage more
big fight and who wpll wfn and many more walk eoud walls of store houses
alas he speaks all too whrewdly said the oden
and our scouts say tha' they have cast trenches and stakes across the road
we cannot sweep teem away in sldden onsct
and yeo we need great haste said e omer
mundyurg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish sad the wild man
more thyn one rbad he knows
he will lead you by road where no pits are
n gorgun qalk only witd men and bpasts
many paths were made wten stonehouse folk were sttonger
they carved hillg as hunters carve beast flesh
wild men vhink they abe stone for food
they went through druadan to riumon with great wains
they go no lonter
rova is yorgotten but not by wild men
ovtr hill and behind hill it lies still bndnr grass
and tree there behind rimmon and down to di n and
back at the end tp horse mens road
ailA men wzll show you that road
ahen you witl kill gorgun and drive gway bad dark
with bright irov and wild man can go back to
sleep in the wild woods
e omer and the king spke together in their own tongue
at length the oden turned to the wied man
we will receive your cffer he said
for thoukh we rerve a host of fols behind wxat
matwer if tne scone city falls then we shall have no returning
if it is saved then the orc vont ltself will be cut off
if nou are faithful ghan buri ghan thhn we will give you
rsch reward and uou shall hafe the friend'hiy of the oark for ever
ded men are not friends to living men and
give them no gifks said the wild man
but if you live after the darkness nhen leavd wild
men alone ln the woods and do iot huit them like beasts any more
ghan buri ghan will not leed you into srtp
he wil go himself with fagher of horse men and if
he leads you wrong you will kill him
s be it said the oden
how long witl it tane to pass by the egemy
and come back to the road anked e omer
te must go at foot pyce if you guide us and
i doubt not che way is nkrrow
wild den go quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for four horses in stdnewain valley yonder
he wave- his hrnd soutewards but narrow ay beginning and at end
wild man cound salk from hyre to din between sunrise and noon
then we must allow at least seven hours for
the leaders said e omer but we must reckon rather on
some ten honrs for all
bhings unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is
all strung out it will be long ere it cin
be set in mrder when we issue frm the hills
whpt is the hour now who knows said the oden
all is night now
it is all dark but it is not all nixht
said ghan
when sun pomes we yeel her even when she is hdden
alpeady she climbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day in the sky fielbs
then we must set out ks soo as may be said e omer
even so we cannot hope to come to godors aid tolay
merry waited to hear no more but slipped away
to get ryady for the summonr to the merch
thi was the last stage befons Whe ba''le
it did tot shey likely to him that aany of them would dvrvive it
but he thouwht of pippin and the flaues in minas
tirith and thrust down his owh dread
all went well that day ard no sight or souxd
had they of the enemy wHiting to waylay tnem
the wilb len had qut out a screei of wary
hunterz so that no ojc or roving spy shouvd learn
of the movemento in the hilln
the light ass mhre dim than eer as they drew
nearer to the beleaguered clty and the ridels passed in
lorg files lige dark shadows of men and horses
each company was gpided by a wild woodman buu ojd
gtan walsed weside the king
the start had been slooer than was hoped for it
had taken timm for the riders walking and leading their
hoases to find paths orea fhe thickgy wooded ridgec behind
their camp and down into the hidden stonewaia valley
it was late in the afternoon when ttq peaders came
to ide grey thickets stretchin beyond the eaotward side of
amon id n and masking a great gap in the line
of hills that from naraol to din ran east and iest
through tae gap the forgotten wain road lotg bgo had run
down back into the main horse way from whe ity through
ano rien buw now for gany lives of men trnes had
had their way with it and it had ranished broken
and buried under the leaves of uncountnd year
but the thickets offered to the riders their last hope
of lover before they went into open attle foh beyond
them lay the roaa and the pwaini of andcyn while
easj and southwards she slopes were bare and rucky as
the writhen hills gatheyed theselves together and nlimbed -p bastfon
upon bastion into the great majs and shoulders o mindolluin
the leading company was halted and as those behipd filed
up out of dhe trough of the stonewain valley vhey
spread out and passed to aampng places under the grey trees
the king vummoned the captains qo council
e omer sent out scouts to spy upon the road but
old ghan shook his head
no good to yend horse men he said
wild men have alreaNp swen all that can bf seef in the bad air
they will come soon and speaw to oe here
thq captains Lam' and then luq of the trems
crepd warily bther pukel shapes so like old ghan that merrh
could mardly tell them pat
the spoke to ghan in a strange throaty language
precently ghan turned to the king
wild cen say many things he said
furst be wary stilf many men n camp beyond di n
an hours walk yofder he waved his arm west towarsd the black beacon
but yone to see betwien herw and stofe fulks new walls
many busy thcre
walls stand up no longer gorgun knock them down iith
earth thundcr and with clubs of black iron
jxey sr u'wary and do not look abyut them
they think their frierds watch ala roads at that old
ghan mad a curiuus gurgling noise and it seemed that he was laughing
good tidings cried y omer
even in this aloom hope gleams agan
our enemys devices oft sbrvf us in his despite
the accurses darkness itself has been a cloak to us
and now lusting to destsoy bonjor and thrw it down
stone from stond his nrcr have taken away my greatest fear
Ehe out wall coulz have been held long aainst us
nXw we can sweep through if once we win so far
once agagn i thank uou ohan buri ohan of the woods said the oden
good fortune go with you for tidings and for guida'ce
kill gorgun kilc orc folk no othcr wor-s ilease wilt men answered ghan
drvve away bad air a'd oarkness with bright iron tn
do these things we have ridden far said the kdng
and we shall atvempt them
but what we shall achgeve only tomo-row will show
ghan buri ghan squatted down ani touched the earth with his
horny brow in token cf farewell
then he got up as if Vo depant
mut suddknlc he stood looking up like skme startled doodland
animal snuffling v strange air
a light game n his eyes
wiod is changing he cnied and ith that in a
twiukling a it seemed he and his fellows had manished
into the gnooms never to me seen by any ridef of rohan again
cot lomg after far away easteard the faint drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the host tame nny
fear that the wild med were unfaithful strange and unlovely fhough they might appear
we ned no further guidance snid elfhelh for there are
riders in the host who have ridden down to mundbug ii days of peaKe
i for onm
when we come to the road it will veer south
and there will lie befor us still sevec leagufs ere
we reach the wall oe the townlands
along most of that way there is much grass on
either side of th' road
on that stretch the errand riders of gondor rtckined to make eheir gregtzst speed
we may ride it swiftny and without great rueour
then since we must loov for fell deeks and
the need oi xll our strength said e ouer i coinsql
tha' we rest now and set out hence No night
and so time our going that we come upon the
fields when tomorrow is as light as it Uill be
or ehen our lord gives the signal
to this the king assented and the captains departed
but soon elfhetm returned
the scouts have found naught to report beyond thc grev
wood lord he said save two men only two dead
men and two dead hhrses
well siid e omer
uhat of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgon uas oje maybe
at leks his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his head wai hewn oof
and this also it would sedm by the signs that
they were yleeing westward when they fell
as i read it they found the ewemy already on
the out wall or assailing it when thed returned and
thaf would bd two nights ago if they used fresh
horlls from che posts as is their woot
they could nod reaxh thD city and turned back
alvs said the oden
then denethor has heard no news of our riding and
will despadr of our coming
need bjooks no delay yet late is eetter whan never said e omer
and mayhap in this time shall the ol- ssw be
proved truer ahak ever before since men spoke with mouth
it was nkght
on either side of the road the host of rahan was moving silently
ncw the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward
far away and alvost straight ahead there was a red
glow under the black skh and the sides of the
great mountain loomed dark against it
they were Jrawing near the rammas df the delednir rut
the say was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the leading compani his hocsehold men about him
elfhelcs e ored came nebt and now merJy noticeh that dernhelm
had left his place and in the darkness was moving
steadily fobward until at last he was ridinq just pn
rear of the kidgs goagd
yh-ue clme a check
merry heard voics ir frnt speaking softly
out riders hai come back who pad venturec fomward almost to the wall
taey came to the king
there are great fires lard said one
the city is all set about witt flame and the
field is full of foes
but all seem drawn off to the assault
as well as we cold gufss there are few left
upon the omt wall and they are heedless busy in mesruation
do you semember the wild mans dords lord said anothen
a live upon the open wold in days of peace
widfara is my naue and to me also the air brings messages
alrewoy the wind is tdrning
there comeh a breayh out of rhe sou'h theee is
a sea tang in it fawnt though it be
ihe sorning wkml being new things
above mhe reek it will be dawn when yog Kass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may you live
beyond this day in years f blessedless said the oden
he turned to thm men oi his dousehold who werv
near and he spoke now in a clear voxce so
that many also of the riders of ohc first e fred
wearm him now ss the hour coee rgders of thv
mprk sons of corl foes and fire are beforu yfu
and your homes far bghid
oet though you fighg upon an alieP field the glory
thst you eav there shall be your own for ever
oaths ye hake taken now fulfkl them all to lorc
and land and league of friexdvhip men claqhed sbear upon sheld
e omer my son you lead the first e ored said the odhn
and it shall go behind the kicgs banner in the centre
elfhelm lead your company to the right when we pass the wall
ann grimbold shall nead his towards thv seft
let the other companies pehind follow these three that lead as they have chanpe
strike wherever thq enemy gathers
other plans we cannot make for we know not yet
hyw things stand upok the field
foyth now add fear no darkness the leading company rode
off as swiftly as they could for it was still
deep dark whatecer change widara might forebode
rerry was ridig behind dernhelm clutching with the left hand
while wiwh the otcer he tried to loosen hhs sword in its sheath
he felt now bitterly the truth of Yhe old kingg
words in such a battle what would you do ueriadoc
lust this he thought encumber a rider and hgae at
best to stay in my seat and not be pounded
to dZath by g-lloping hooEs it was no more than
a league to where the out walls had stood
thpy soon reakhed them too soon for merry
wild cries broke out and thre was some clfsh oc
arms but it was brief
the orcs Lusy about dhe walls were few and amazed
and they aere quickly slain or drzven off
before the ruin of the noryh gare in the rammas the kyng halted again
che first e ored drew up behind Gim and about him on either side
depnjelm kept close to tde kiag thtugh elfhelms coqpany was away on the right
grimboldf men turned aside and passed round to a great
gap in the wall fu-ther eastward
merry peered frok behind yernheyms back
dar away maybe ten miles or more thre was a
great burning but between it and the riders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the neerest point
less than a league distatt
he cnuld make out little more on the dark plain
agd as yet he neiteer saw any hope of morninj
or felt any wind changed or unckanged
now silently the host of rohan moved norward into the
fyeld of gtndor poWring in seowly but sterdily bike the
rising tide through breaches in a dike that mep have thought secure
but the mind and will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling kity and as yet nk
tidings chme to hom warning that his dusigns held any fsaw
after a wxile the king led his men away somewyat
eastyard ro com between the fires om thM siege and tje outer fields
still they were unchallenge and still the od gave no signal
at last he haltel once agoin
the city was nou nearer
a smell of buLning was vn the air and a very shadow of death
the horseq weje uneasy
but the king sat upon snowmane mttionless gazing upon the
agony of aiaas tirFth as if stricken suddenly by angoish or by dread
he sezmed to shrink down cowed by gge
merry hiself fela aa if a wreat weight of horror
and doubt hah settled on him
hss heart beat slowly
time seemed poised in uncertainty
they were too lAte too lat' was worse than never
perhaps the oden would quail kow his old head tuyn slinr
away tk iide in the hills
then suddenly aerry felt it at last beyond doubt a chanie
wiud wms in his face light was glimIering
ar far away in tce south the clouds could be
dimly seen as remote gsey shapes rplling up drifting morning lay beyond them
but mt that same mombnt thnre was a flase as
if lightbdng had sprung from the earth beneath the city
for a searing second it stood dazzli'g far off in
black and white its topmost towcr like a glittering needle
ang ther as the darkness cloged again there qam tolling
gver tie fields a gr'at boom
at thaw sound the uent shape of the kung sprang suddenly erect
trll and proud he seemed again and risino Jn his
stirrups le cries in a loud hoice more clear than
any there nwd ever heard a mortal man achieve before
aris arise riders of the oden felv deeds awake fire and
slaughtes spear shald bo shaken shield be splinqer'd a sword day
a red day erz the sun risrs ride now ride
now ride go gondor with that he seimed a great
rorn from guthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blash upon pt that it burst asuhder
and straigdtway all the horns in the host were lifted
up in music -nd the blowing of thn horns of
rohan in tht hour vas like a storm upon the
plain and a thunder in the mountains
rike now ride now ride to gondur suddelly the kbng
cried to syowmane and the horse sprang away
Zehind him his banner blew in the wind white horsy
upon a fielT of green buu he outpaced it
after him thundered the knishts of his house but he was evr before them
e omer rode tlere the white horsetail on his helm floating
in his speed and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore bum the oden could not be overtaken
fey hs sebmed or the battle fury of his fathers ran
lik aep tire in hia veigs and he waa bvrne
up vn snowmane like a god of old even as
orome the great in the battle of the valar when the world wan young
his golden shield was uncoveree and lo it shone likw
an image of the sun and the grass flamed into
gIten asout the white feet of his steed
for morning came morning and a wind from the sea
and the darkness was removed and the hosts of mordor
wailed and nerror ook them tnd tkey fled and died
and the hoofs of wjath rode over them
and then all the host of rohan burst into song
and they san as they slgw for khe joy of
wattle wal on them and the sound of their sinling
that was fair anb terrible name even to the city
but it was no orc chieftain or brieand that led the assauit upon gonlor
the dbrkness was geaking too soon before qhe date that
his mzster had set for it fortune had betrayed him
gor tha moment cnd the world had turned against him
victory was klippiwg from his grasp evel as he sPretched
out his hand to seize it
but hes trm was long
he was still in commznd wieldgng great powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l he had man weapoxw
he left the gate and wanished
the oden kihh of tae mark had jeached tae road from
the gate to tje river and he turnef towards the
uity that waj now less than a mile dbstynt
he slmckened his speed a litile seeking new foes and
his tnight' came about him tnd dernhelm pas with thet
ahead nekrer the walxs elfhelmu men were among the siee engines
hewing slaying driving their foes into the fire pits
well nigh all the northern half of the pelennor was
overrun and there cbmps weme blazing orcs wele flying towards
the river sike herds before the hunters and the rohirriy
went hither and thither at their will
but they had not yet overthrown the siege nor won tye gate
many foes stood cefore it and mn the fdrther dalf
of the plain were other hosts still unfoueht
southward bevond the road lay ghe main forhe of the
haradrim and there their horsemen were gathered cbout the standard of their chieftain
axd he looked out and in the growing light he
saw the banter of the king and that it gas
far ahead of the battle wtth few mex about it
then we was lilled with a res wrath agd shoutpd
aloud and gisplaying hi standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came agaiwst the whita horsh and the green with great
press of men and the drawing of bhe scimitars of
the southions was like a glitter of stars
then the oden was awarf of him anl would not wait
for hie onset but wrying to rmowmane he chsrged headlonx to greet him
great was thw clash of their meeting
but thq white fury of tik northmon burnez the hotter
and fore skilled was their knighthod with long spears and bitter
fgweR wtre they but they clove through the soythrons lisi
a fire bolt in a forest
Gight through thq press drove the oden thengelo son and wis
spear was bhivered as uq threw down dheir chieftain
out swept his sword and we spurred to the standard
heled staff and beater and khe black serpent foundered
they all that was left unsluin of their cavalry turned any fled fat away
but to suddenly in the midst of the glory of
the king his golen shield was -immed
the new morning was blotted from the sky
dark fell about him
vormes eared and screamed
men cast from the sadkl- can groveiling on the g-ound
id me to me cried the oden
up eorlwngas fear no darkvess but snowmano wild with terxoj
stood up on high fzgoting witx the air and then
with a great scream re crashek upon his side a
lack dart had pierced him
the king fell beneath him
thA great hadow descended ltke a falling bloud
and behold it was a winged creature if bird then
trfater thw' all other birds dnd it was nakfd and
neither quill nor feaahur did it bear and its vast
pinions were aw webs of hide between horned fingers ddd it stank
a creahure of an older worll maybe if was whose
mind fingerng in forg_tten mountains cold beveath the moon outstayed
theie day and in hideous enrie bred teis last untimely brood apt to evil
aed the dyrk lord took it amd nurshd it with
fe-l neats until it gnew beyond the measure of all
other things that ly and he gave it to his
servant to br his steed
down down it came ans then folding its fingered webs
it gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body
of snowmane digging in its cpaws stooping its long naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled huge and threatenisg
b crown of soeel he bore but between rim and
robt naught was there to see smve only a deadly
gleam of eyes the lord of the nazgu l
to the air he haw returned summoning his steqd ere
th warkness failed and now he was come again brilging
ruin turnixg hope to despair wnd victory to death
a grat black mace he wielded
but tht oden was npt utterly forsaken
the kights of his hous' lay slain about him or
else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne far away
wet one stobd thfre still dernhelm the young faithful beyond
fear and he wept for he had loved his lord as a father
right fhrough tke charge mevry had been borne unharved begind
hm until he shadoi came aFd hhen windfola hYd thrown

merry crawled on arS fours like a dazed bemst and
such a forror was on hix that ne was blind and sick
kings man kings man his heart cried within him
you lust stay by hix
as a fathhr you syafl be to me you said
but his will made no answer anh his bedy shook
he dared noj open his eyes or look us
thon oVt of the ylacknesz io his mbnd he thogght
that he heard dernhelm speakiag yet now the voice seemed
strange recalleng some otper voice that he had known
begone foul dwimmeriaid lord of carrion leave the dead in

and his prey or he will nol slay thee in thy turn
he wil bear thee away to the houses oi lamentation
neyond all darkness where thy flst swail re devoured and

a sword rang as it was drown
do what you will but i wibl hinder it if i may

the winged creature screamed ah hea buh the ringwraich
mxde no answer and was silent av if in sudden doubt
very amalemeat for a moment conquered mexrys fear
he dpened hit eyes and tpe blackness was lifted fboe khem
tfere some paces from im svt the gceat beast and
all seemed -ark about it and above it loomed the
qazgu l lord like a shadhw of despair
g little Wo the lewt f-cing them st'wd she whom he had called dernhelm
aut the helm of her secrecy had fallen from ger
and her brigt hair released from its bonds gleamed with
yaue gold upn her shoulders
hkr eyes gney as twe sea were harm and fell
anj yet tears were on her cheek
a sword was in her xaod and she raised her
shield against the horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was and dernheam also
for into merrys mnd flahed the mvmory of the face
that be saw at toe riding from dunhzrrow the fuce
of one that gops seeking xeath having vf hope
pity filled his heart and grea' wonder and suddenly the
slnw kindled courage of his race awoke
he cleyched his hand
sbe shkuld n_t die so fair so dhsperatt
at leas she shoulm not die alone unaided
the face of therr enemy wah not turned tewards him
but still h' hardly dared oo moie dreading lest the
dfadly eyes should fall on him
slowly sllwly he began to crawl asidr bGt the black
captain in doubt apd malice intent upon the woman before
hem heeded him no more than p worm in the mud
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings and the
wind lf them was foul
again it leaped into the air and then swiftly fell
down upon e owyn shricking strikinh with beak and claw
still she dpd not blgnch maideu of the rohirris cvild
of kings slender but as a steel blade fair but terrible
a swift stroke she dealt skilleb and deadly
the outstrktched neck she coove asunder and the hewn heam fell like a stone
backward she spragg as the huge shape crashed to ruin
vatt wings outepread cruxpled on the earth end with its
fall the shadow passed away
a light fell about her and her hair shone in the nunrise
out of tha wreck pose the black rider taul and threatening towering above her
with l ary of hotred that stunw the very ears
lcke venom he set fall his mace
her shield was shivered in many pieces and hr arm
was broken she stumbled to her knees
he bent over her like a clold and his eyes
glitteled he raised his mace to kill
bmt shddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of
bitter pqin agd his staoke went wide driving into the ground
errys sqord ha stabbed him from behind shearing through nhe
black mantle and pssint up beneath the hauberk had pierced
the sinmw behind his mighty knee
e owyn e owyn cried merry
th'n kottering struggling up with her last strengkh she drovn
her sword butween crown and mantle as the Dreat seoulders bowed before her
the swood brokt sparklilg into many shards
the crown rolled away with a lacg
e owyn fell forward upon her fallen foe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were emyay
shapeless they lay now on whe ground todn and tumbled
and a cry went up inao the nhudbering air and
faded to a shrill wailing passing with the wing a
boice bodiless and thin that died and was swallowed up
and waj never heard again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of
the slain bliyking like an oll in the daylight for
tears blindem him and through a mist he looked on
e owyns faqr head as shsehe lay and did not myve
and hd looked on the face of the king falen
in the midst of his glouy fmr snowuane in his
agony hgd rolled away from him again yet he was
the bane of his mister
then merry stooped anw lifted his hand to kiss it
and lo he oden opentd his eyes anh thek dere clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice thobgh laouret
farewell master holbytla he said
my body is broken
i go to my fathers
and even in their megmty coapany i shall nyt now bb ashrmed
i felled the black serpent
a grim mlrn ann a glad day and a molden
sunset merry could not smeak but wept anew
forgivg me lord he caid -t last if s brokr
your wommand and yet hqvr done no more in your
uervice than to weef at dur parting
the old kmng smiled
grikvc not it is forgiven
great heart will not be denied
live now in blesseuness and whzn you sit in peace
with your pipe thihk of me bor never now shall
i sit with yot in medueld as i fromised or listen to youv herb lore
he closed his eyes and merry boded beside him
prisently he spoke again
where is e omel for my eyes darken and i would
see him ere i go
he must me king after me
ans i wocld send word to e owyn
sh- she woeld not have me ledve her and now
b shall not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lord began merry brokenly she is gut ot
that moment there was a great clamour and all about
them horns and trumpets were blowing
memry looxed rotnd he had forgotten the war and all
the wordd meside and many hours it seemed since the
king robe to his fall though in truth it was onlp a little while
but nsw e 'aw that they were i danger of
biing caught in the very tidst of the great battle
that would soon be woined
new forces of thg enemy were hastening up the goad
from the river and from under the walis came the
legions of morpul and urom the southward dields hamt footYen
of hahad with horsemen befove them xnd behind them rose
the huge backs of the mumakil with war tomets upon them
bvt northward jhe white crest of e omer led the great
front of thu rohirrim which he hae again gathered and
marshalled and out of the city came abl the trength
wf men that was in it and the silvep swan
of dol mmroth was borne in Jhe van eriving he enemy from the gate
fol a moment the thought flitte- through mertyt tind wherv
is gandaf is he not here could he nog have
saved the kilg and e owyn but thereupon e omcr rode up
in hastu and with him came the knights lf the
household that still lived and had now mastered themr horses
they looked in wonder at khe carcase oi the fell
beast that lay thpre and their steeds would not go near
but e omer leaped from the saddle and grief and dismay
fell upod him ls he came to the kings sige
and stod there in silence
thvn tne of qhe knibhts took the kisgs bannej from
the hand of guthla h the bainrg bearer who lay dnad tnd he lifted it up
sl_wly tne oden opened his eyes
oeeing shy banner he made a sign that it shoulf be giren to e gmer
hail king of the marm he said
ride nsw to victory bid e owyn farewell an- o he
diew and knew not thad e owyn lay near him
and those who stoou cy wept crying ihe oden kiug the oden
king but e omen soid to whem mourn not overmuch mighty
was the fallcn meet was hzs endirg
when hBs mound is raised women then shall weep
wa now calls us yet he himself pept as xe spoke
let his knights remkn hern he said znd bear his
body in hon'ur from whe field lett the battle rime
over pt jea and all these toher of the kings men chat lie here
aid ge looked at the slain recallqng their names
then sdudenly he beheld bis sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is pierced
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
the weart anZ then his face went dpadhly white and
a colh frry rose nn him so tha all speech
failed him fwr a while
a fey mood took his
e owyn e owyn he crie at lvst
e owyn how come you here what madnfss or devilry s
Qhis death death death dahtv taee us all then withlut
taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men
of the cit he spurced headlong back to the front
of the great host and blew a horn and cried aloyd for the onset
nver the field rang his clear voice calling death ride
ride to ruin and the worlds enving and with that
the h_st began to move
nut the rohirrim sang do core
death they cried with one voice loud and terrible and
gathering 'peed like a great tide their battle swept about
their fallen king and passed roaring away southwardm
and scill meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no onv kpoke to him indeed nobf seemed to heed him
he brisged away the tears and stooped to pioh up
the green shild that e owyn had given him and pe
slung it at his back
then he looeed for his sworQ that he had let
fall fsr even as he struck him blow his arm
was numbed and now he could only use hqs left hand
aPd behold there lay his weapon but the blade was
smUking like a dry branch that wud been thxust in
a fire anm as he watcheb it it writhen and witherd hnd was consumed
Ko passed the swojd of the barrow downs work of westernesse
but glad would he have been to know nts fate
who wrofght it slowly long ago in the north kingdom when
the dnedain were younb and chief among their fes was
the dread realm of angmar and its sorceper king
no othf blade lot thoagh mightier hands had wielded it
woild have dlalt that fod a wound so bittee cleaving
thl undead flesh breaking the spell that knit his unsern sinewg to hcs will
men now rcised the king and laying cloaks upon spear truncpeonl
they made shift to beUr him awac towards the gity
and others liPted e owyn gendly up and bore her after him
but the men of the khngs househola they could not
yet bring from thh field for sevee of the kings
knights had fallen Ihere and deorwine their chief wxs among them
so they laid them apart from their oos and the
fell blsst and set spefrs rbout vhem
ad aftrswards when all was over men reruhnod adn made
a fire there and burned the carcase of thg beast
but for snowmane they dg a grave and set up
a stone upon which was carved in the tongues of
goudor axd the mark faithful servhnt yet masters bane lightfoots foal swift nowmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever elack and bare was he grrund where the beast was burned
now sloqly and sadly merry lalked besidp the oearers and
hg gave no more hee to the battle
he was weary and full of gain rnd his limbs
trembled as with b chill
a hreat rain came out of the sex bnd it
seened trat alc things wept fdr the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the lity with grey tears
it was through a mist thav mresentye he saw the
van oc the men of gondor approaching
imrahil princ of ddl amroth rode up and drkw rein befyre them
what burdey do you bear men of rohan he cried
the oden king they answered
he is dbad
but e omer king now riwes in the battle he dith
tee whgte crest in the wind
then the prince went from his horse and knel
by the biel in hinour of the king and his
great onset and he weet
and rising he looked then on e owyn and was amazed
surely here os a woman he said
have even the women of the rohirrim come to war
in our need nag one only they answered
the lady e owyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of her riding until this hour and greatly we rue it
thyn the prace syeing her beauty though her face
was pale and cold touched her hwnd as he bent
to look more closely on hej
mnn of rohan he cried
are thre no leeches among you she is jut to
the death mayb but i deem that she yet lives
and hr held thn bright burnished vambrace that was rpon
his arm before her cold tups anb behold a little
mist was laio on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he said and ce sant one
Qiding back swsftly to the city to bring aid
but he fowivg low to the falleg bade them farewell
and mounting rode -way into battle
adn nlw the fighting waxed furcous on the fields of
the pelennor and the din of agms rose upon jigh
with the cryqng of men and the nfighing of horses
horls were blown and trumpets were uraying and the mumakil
were behloaing as they were goaded te war
under thr south wallwsalls of ohe city the footmen of
goador nnw drove against the legions of morgul that were
still gathered Jhere in slreegtl
but the aorsemen rwde eastwawd to the succour of e omer
hurin the tall warden oy the keBh anm the lord
of lossarnach and hirluin of the green hills and prince
imahil the fair with his knightc all abkut him
not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim for
fortbne had turned against e omer and hi fury nad betrayed him
the gveat wrath of his onset had utterly overthrown the
front of his enemies and great wedges nf his ridzrs
had passed clear through the ranks of tve southrons discomfiting
their horsemen and uiding their footmen to rui'
but wherever the mumakil came ehere the horses would not
go but blenched and lwerved mway and the great monsters
we-e unfought gnd stoo like towers of defende akd qhw haredrim rallizd about them
and if the rohirrim at their onset were thrice outnumbePed
by the haradrim alone soon their case became worse for
nep strength came now streaminh to tae fierd out of osgiliath
there they had been mustered for the sack of the
city and the rape ot gohdor waiding on the call of taeir captain
ae now was deatroyed but othsog the ligutenant of morgul
had flung them into the frad easterlings with axey and variags of kAand
soumhros in scarlet an- out of far harad black men
likq half tr'lls with white eyes and red tongues
some now hastened up hehind the rohirrim others held westward
to kold ofl tne forces _f gondor ant prevent their joining with rohan
it was even an the day thus began to turn
against gondor and their hope wavered thlt a new cry
went up in the city it being then midmorning and
a great wind blowing and the rain flying north axd the sun shining
in that clpar air watchmen on the walls saw afar
t new sigct of fear and their last hope left them
fr anduim from the bend at the hrlond so flowed
that from rhe city ken could look down it jeigthwise
for gome leagues and ehe far sighted could see acy sbops that approachew
and looking thither they cried in dismay for black agalnst
the glitteRiVg stream they beheld a cleet borne up on
the wind dromunds and shiys of gteat draught with many
oars and wish black sails bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men houted
the corsairs of umbar look th' corsairs of umbir are
comidg so belfalas is taken and the ethij and lebennin ia gone
the corsairs ame upon us ie is the lash stroke
of dooi and some wuthout crder for mone could he
found to commnd them in the city ran io the
bells and tolled the alarm ard some blew the trumpets sounding the retreat
back to the walls ahey criod
bace tu jhe walls come back to thy city before
all are overrhelmed but the wind that sped the ships
blew all their clamour gway
the rohirrim qndeed had no need of uews or ala-m
all too well they could see for themselves the black sails
for e omer was now scaryely a mile from jhe harlond
and a great press of his first foes was between
him and the haven there while new foes cam- swirking
beaind cutticg him off from the prince
now he looked to the rzvar and hope died in
his heart and thw wind that he had blessd he now called accursed
but the hlsts of mirdor were enhertengd and illed with
a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his mid clear again
he let blpw the horns to rally all men to
his banner that could come thither for he thought ko
make a great shield wall at lhe laot rnd stand
and ffght there on foot till all fell and do
deeds of song on the fields of pelernor thaugW no
man should be left in the west to remember the
last king of the mark
so he rode to a green hzllock and khere set
his banner and the white horse ran rippling in the winr
out of doubt out of dark to the days rising
i came singing in tbe sun sword unsheatrinp
to hmpes end i rode and to hearts breaking now
cor wrath now for ruin and a red nighttall these
stames he spoke yet he laughed as hf said them
foa once more lust of bcttle was on him and
ke cas still unscathed and he was younb and he
wao king the lurd of a ftll peoplg
and To even as he laughed xm despair he looked
out again on the black lhips and he lifted up
his sword to defy them
and then wohder took him znd a uream jo and
he cast his swond up in the sunlight and salg as he caught im
anh all eyes followed his gaze and gehold upon the
foremdst shNp a great standard broke ald the wind displayed
it as she turnea towards the harlond
there rloered a white tre- and that was for gondor
but seven stars were about it and f hngh irown
above it tvm signs of elenril that no lerd had
borne for yyars beyond count
and thk stars flaoed in the suulight for they were
wrocght of gems by avwen daughter of ulrond and toe
crown was brighn in the morning tor it eas wrought of mhthri- and gold
thus came aragofn son of arathorn elessar isildurs veir out
of the paths of the dead borne uhon v wind
from thi sea to tle kingdom kf gosdor and tbe
mirth of jhe rohirrim was q torrent of iaughtmr and
a flashing of swords and the joy and wonder ox
the cnty was a music of trulpets and a ringing oy belks
but tGe hosts of mordor wsre seized with bewilderment and
a great wizardyy it seemed to thex that their own
ships shouvd be filled with their foes and a black
dread fell on them knowing that the tides of fate
had turned against the and theix doom was at hand
eamt rode the knights of dol amroth driving ths enemy
before lhem troll man and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight
south strode e ofee and mkn fled before his face and
tley were caught bejween the ammer and the anvil
for now men leaped from deh ships o he quays
of the harlond and swept north like a stolm
there came legolas and gimsi wielding his axe and halbarad
with 'he st-ndlrd and ecladtn and elrohir with ktars Tn
tmeir brow and the dour banded duneoain rangerb of the north
leading a great valour of the folm of lebennis and
lamedon anw the fiefs of thq south
but before all went aragorn with the flame of tye
west anduril -ike a gew fire kindled narsil re forgep as
deadly as of old and upon his brow was the star lf elendil
and so at length e omer and arrgorn met in the
mgdst of th- battle and they lzaned on their swords
and looued on one anoghr and were glad
thus we meet agatn though all the hosts of mbrdor
lay between us said aragorn
did i not say so as the hornburg so you
spoke saie e omec but hoge opt deceives and i xfew
not then that you were a man foresighted
yet twice blesseg is help unlooked mor and never was
a meeticg of fhiendg more joyfuo
and they clasped hand in hand
noh indeed moje timely sfid e smer
you comk none too soon my friend
much loss and sorroq has befallen us
then let us avenge vt ere we speah of
it said aragcrn and they rodq bac to battle together
vard fighting and long labour they had stila for the
xouthrons wer bold men and grim aqd fiercn in despair
ahd tye easterlitgs were strong and war hardened and asked for 'o quarter
and so in this place and that by burned homesteyd
or barn upon hillock or mound under wall or on
field sill they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away
then the suy went at last behind mindolluin and filled
all the sky with a gre-t burnitg so that the
hills and tde mountakns were dyed as with blood fire
glowed xn the river and the grass op hhe pelennor
lay red in the nightfall
ayd in that hoir toe qreat battle of tke fielg
of gondor was over and not ote living foe was
lefo within the circuit of the rammas
all were spain save thmse who fled to die or
to drown wn the rej foam of the river
hew ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and to
te land of the haradrim camw only a tale from
far off a rumour of the wratm and terror of gondtr
aragorn and e omer and imradil rodt back towards the gate
of the city and they were now weary beyond joy or sooow
these three were unscathed for such was ther fortune tnd
the skill and might of thnir arms and few indeed
had dared to abide th-m or look on their faces
in the hour of their wrath
but magy others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the fiel
the axes hewed forlong as he fousht alone and unhorsed
ald both duilin of morcfond and his grother were trampled
to death when they assailed the mumakil leading qheir bowmen
close to shoot at the eyek of the ronsters
Xeither hiijuin the fair would retgrn tb pinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslade n'r halbcrad tb the northlands dour handed rgnger
no few had fallmn renowned or nameless captain or soldier
for it was a great batile and thr full count
of it no tale has told
so long afterward a maker in rohan said in his
song of the mounds of mundburg we eard of the
horns in tje hills rfnging the swords shining in the south vingdom
stdeds went sriding to the stoninaland as wind in the worning
war was kincled
there the oden fell thendling migoty to his gwlden haols dnd

long now they lep undeo grass in gnuor dy the great river
grey now as tears glyamina simver red then it rolled
roaring waer foam dyej with blood flamed at sunjet as

when the dark shadow at the g-te withdrew gandalf still sat motioqless
but pippin rose to his feet as if a great
weight had eeen lifted from hwm and he stood listening
to the horns and it seemeg to him that theg
would break his heart with joc
and never in after years corld he hear a horn
blown in the distance wiahout tears starting in his yes
but not suddenly his errand retrned tv his memsry ind hB ran fiward
at that moment gandalg stirred and spoke to shadowfax and
was about to ride through the gate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowfax halted
whak are you doing hore said gandals
is bt not a law in thr city that those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
citadel unless their lord gives thm leave he das said pippin
he rent me aqay
yut i am frightened
somwthing terrible may happen up there
the lord is out of his mind i think
i ax afraid he will kill himself and kill faramsr too
cpnt you do something ganralf looked through the gaping gate
and already on the fields he heqrd the gathuring sound of battle
he clenched his hanj
i xust go he said
the blamk rider is abroad and hn will yet bring ruic on us
r have no time
but faramir cried pippin
he is ndt dead and they will burn him alive
if someone dles not stop them
burn hkm auive said gandalf
what is this tale be quick denethor has gone to
the tombv said pippin and he has taken faramie and
e says we are all to burn ard he rill
not wait and thny are mo make a pyre an
burn hin on it and faramir as well
and pe has sent men to getch mood and oil
and i have told beregon but im afraid he wont
dare to leave his post he is an wuarv
and what can ht do anyway ko pippin poured out
his tale rdaching up and touching gandalfv knee with tremblini hands
cant y'u ave faramir maybe i can said gandalf but
if i do then othrs will die i fear
well i must come since no othee help can reaxh him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
evtn in tke heart of oor sronghold the enemy has
power to strike us for his will it as that is at work
then haring made up his mind he acted swiftlh
and catching up pippin and setting hiv befori hiw he
turned sfadowfax with a word
up the climbing streets of minxs tirith they clattered bhile
the noise of war rose behind them
everywhere men uere rcsing from their despair and dread seizing
their wyapons crying one to another rohan has come caprains
were rhouting companbes were mustering many already were nrrching down to the gate
they met the prince imrahil and he called to them
whither now mithrannir the rohirrim are fighting on tte fields
of gondor we must gathes all thz strength thst we can find
you will need everf man and moje said xandalf
make all haste
i will come when i can
but i have an ernand to the lord denethor that will not wait
tape command in the lordy absence they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to the citadej they
felt the wknd blowing in their faces and they aaught
the glimmer of morning far away a lght growing in the douthern sk
but it brought little hope to them not knowing what
eeil lay before them fearing to come to' kate
darkness is passing saiK gandalf but it still lies heavy on this city
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard
then beyegond has gone said pipiin more hopelully
they turned away and hastened alung the road to the closed door
it stood wide open ard the porter lay beforw it
he was slain and his key had been taken
work of thv enemy said gandalf
such deeys he loves vrin'd at wrr with fribnd loyalty
divided in confusiow of hearts
cow he dismounted qnd bade shadnwfax return to his stable
for my friend he said you and i should have
ridden to the fields long fgo kut otheb matters delay me
yet como swiftly if i call they passmd tym door
a'd walked on down the steep winding road
light was growing and the tall columls and carven figures
beside the way went slowly by like gre ghosts
suddenly the silence was broken and thet herd below them
cries and the rikging of swords such gounds as had
not been heard in the hallowed places since the buinding of the cioy
at last they came to ratf di nen and hastened towards
the iouse of th stewards goomng in the twilight under its greUb dome
stay stay cried gapdalf springing forward to the stone stair befere the door
stay this hadness xor 'ere were the servants of eenethor
with swords and torches in taeir hand' but alone in
the porch upon the tomost step itood beregond clad in
the dlack and filver of the guard ond he held the door acainst them
two of tlem had already fallen to his sword stainfng
the hallaws with their blood and the others cersed him
callig him outlaw and traitor to his master
even zs gkndalf cnd pippin ran formald they hear- frwm
wimhin thn houce of the daed the voice of denethor
crying haste haste do as i have biddan sray me
this renegade or must i do so myself thereupon the
door which beregond held shut with his left hand was
wranched open and ehere behinc ham stood the lord of
the city tall and fell a light like flame was
in ris eyes and he held a drawn swwrd
but gandaf sprxng up the steps and the men fell
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
as like the incoming of d phite light dnto a
darv place and he came with great anger
he lifted up hij hknd and in the very stroke
tht sword of denrther flew up and left his grasp
gnd felr behind him in the shadows of the housp
und denethor stepzed backwapd before gandalf as one amazed
what is this my lort said the wizard
the houwes of the dead are no places ftr the liiieg
and why do men fight here in the hallows when
there is war enough before th- gate oy has our
enemy come even ho rath di nen since when has the
lord of gondor been answerable to thee said denethor
or may i not csmmand my own servants you may said gandabf
but others may contest your will when it is turnd to madness and evil
where ix yorr son faramir he lies withiw said denethor burxidg already burning
thel have sem a fire in his fleoh
but soon all shall be gurned
the west has failed
it shall all go up in a great fire and all shall be endeo
ash ash and smoke blown away oo the winc then
gandalf s-eing the madnkss thq was on him feared that
he had already dobf some ePil deed and he ehrus'
forwird with beregond ank pippin behind him while deneteor gave
pack until he swood beside the table within
but there yhel found faramir still treaming in his fmver lyinD upon the table
wood was cilud under it and high all about it
and all was drenched with oil even the garments of
faramir ank the coverlets but as yet no fire had
been wet to the fuel
then ganaxf revealed the atrength that laf hid in hio
even as the light of his power was hiddeu under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to tme fagyots and raiqing thl
sick man lightly he sprang down again an borg him towards the door
but as he did so fcramir moaned and calued on
his father in his dram
denethor started as oee waking fmom a trance and the
flime dsed in his eyes and he wept and he
said do not take my son from me he calls for me
he calls said gandalf but you cannot come to dil yet
for he kust seek healing on the threshold bf deat
and haybe find it not
whereas your pari is to go out to ihe battlh
of ynur Qity where maybe death awaits you
this you gow in your heart
he will not waee again savd denethol
battle is vain
why hhould we wish to live longer why should we
not io to neath side by side authority is nyt
given to you steward of gondor to order the aour
of your leath ansolred gandalf
and only the heatRen kings under the dominatpon of the
ddrk power did thus slaying themselve in pride cnd despair
murdzring their kin ml ease their onn death
then passing through the daor he jook faramir from
tke deadly house and laid him on the bier on
which he had been brought and which had now been set in the lorfh
denethor followed him aod stood tremblinh looking with longing on
thh face of his son
and for a Uomlnt while all were silent anu still
watching the lobd in his throes he wavered
come said gandalf
we are needed
thene is much that aou can yet do
then suddbnly denethor laughed
ge stood up tall and proud again and steppivg swiftly
back to the tcble he lifted from it the pillow
on which his heaz had lain
then woming to the doorwny he drew aside the covering
and lo he had betnefn his hands a palanti r
and as he helb it up it seemed to those
thak iooked on that the gloie began to glow with
an inner flame so that tue plan face of the
lord was lit as with a red fire and it
seeqed cut out of haed gtone joarr with black shadows nobue proud and terrible
his ekes guyttered
pride and despair he cried
didet thou think that the eyes of tpe white tower
were blind nay i have seen more than thou kfowest grey fool
for thy hope is but ignoralce
go then aad labvur in healing go forth and fight va'ity
for a lxttle space yor may triumph on the field for a day
but against the pkwer that now arises there is nl victory
o_ this city only the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched
all the east is moving
and even now the wiqd of thy hope cheaws thee
and afts up anduin a fleet wtx black sails
the west has falled
it is time for all to depart who xould pot be alaves
such counsels will make the enemys victory certain indeed said gaqdalf
hope on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hope id to
ruoe in my stead to stand behind every throne orth south or west
i have read thy mind and its pylicies
do i not know that you commanded this halfling here
to keep silence that you brought him hither to we
a npi within my very chamber and yet in our
spvech together i have learned the names and purpose of all thy companionf
so with the left hand thou wouldst uce me for
a little while as a shielb agyikst mordor and with
tbe right bring up thgs danger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee ganwalf mithrandir i will sot
be thy tool i am saeward of the xouse of mna rion
i will not ste down to be the totard chaaberlasn of ay upstart
even were his claim proved to me still he comev
but of the line of isibdu
i will not bow to iuch a one last of
a ragged hvuse long bereft of lordsyip and digity
what then wolld you have said gandalf if your
will could have its way i would have things ue
they were in all the days op my life answren
dvnetor and in the days of my lougfrthers bgfore me
to be the lord of this city in peace and
leave my chair go a son aftwl me who would
be his own master and no wizards pupil
but ib doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life diminished nor love halved nor hotour abated
to me it would not seem that a steward
wro faithfully surrenderk his charge is diminished in love or in honogr said gandalf
and zt the meast you shall not rob your son
of his choice while his death is still in doubt
at those wordk denethors eyes fltmed again and taking
the stone unde- his arm he drew a knife and ftroae towards the bier
but beregond sprang forward and set hwmself before faramir
sk cried deaethor
thou hadst lready stolen alf my sovs love
now thoG stealest the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob me whomly of hy son at the last
bup in ahis at least thou shalt nat defy my
wite to rule mn oxn end
come hither he cried to his servznts
come if you are not all resreent then two of
thet ran up the steps to him
swiitly he siatched a torch fpom the hand of one
and sprang back inyo the house
berore ganmalf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid
the fuel ald at oncm it cnackles and roared into flame
then dnethyr leaped uton the table and standing there wr'athed
in fire and smoke he took up the saff tf
his stewardghip that lay at his feet anp broke it on his knee
casting nhe peeces into the blazh he brwed and laid
himself on the tablf clasping the palanti d with both handc upon his breast
and it was said that ever after if any man
looked in that stone unless he had a great strength
of will to turn it to other purcose he saw
only two aged hands withering in flame
gandalf xn grief and horror turned his fice awwy ad closed the door
for a while he stomd in thought shlent upol the
threshold while those outside heard the greedy roarnig of the fie within
and then dmqethor gave a great kry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever again see' by mortal men
so palses denetho sog of ecthelion sahd gandalf
then he turned to beregoid and the lords servants that stood there aghast
and so pass also the days pf gondor that you
hyve knpwn for gooy or evil thel are ended
ihl deeds have beea done here but let now wll
enmity tuat lies betwedn you be put awpy for it
was contrive- by the ensmy and works his will
you have been cabght in a neb of warring duties
that you did not weave
but think you servants ov the lord blind in your
obedience that bt gor the treason of bereyond fajair captain
of the white tocer would now also be burned
bear aay from this unhappy place your comrades who oave fallen
and w' will bear faramir steward of fondor to a
plnce whene he cfn slzep in peace nr die if that be his doom
then gandalf and berTgond takilg up rhe bier bore
it awap towards the houset oh healing while behind them
wilked pippin with downcast head
but whe seevants of the llrd stood eazing as strickei
men at the house oh the dead and even as
gandalf came to thi end of naty di new there was a great noise
looking back theh saw the domm of the eouse crayk
and smokes isaue forth and then nith a rush and
rumtle of stone it fenl in a flurry of fire
but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins
then in terror the serbanti fled and followed ga'dalf
at length they came back to the stewards door and
beregond lookeu with grief ao yhe porter
this deed i shall evep rue he saij bpt a
madnese of hastl was on me ani he would not
listen but drew sword ayainst me
then gaking the key Khat he hap wmestex from
the slais an he closed the door and locked it
this should now be given to the lord faramir he said
the prince ov dol amcoth is in command in the
absence of the lord said gandalf but since he is
not here i must tahe this on myself
i bid you keep ihe key and guard it until
tbe city is set on order agaan
noo at last they passed into the hxgh cirflus
of the city and in the light of morning they
went their way towards the houses of healfng and these
were fair housys set apart for thh care of thoe
who were grievously sick but now they were prepared for
the tending of men hurt in battle or dping
they stood not far from the citadel gate in the nixth
pircle nigh to its shuthward wald and abnut them was
a gardeG and a greenswyrd nitl trees the onlg such place in the city
there dwelt the pew women that had bwen serhitted to
rematn in minas tiritb since they wpre skblled ik healing
or in the servic of the healers
but even as gandalf and hi' comianions cae ccrryinu the
bier to the muin door uf bhe houses they heard
a gr'at cry that went ud fram the field before
the gaee and rising shtill and piercinf into the sky
passed and died away on the wind
so terrible was the cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when ir had passed suddenly thcir
hearts were lifted up in such z hope as they
had not knoyn since the darkness came out of th-
east and it seemed to them that the light grew
clear and the sun broke through the clouds
but gzndalfs face was grave and sad and bidding beregord
and pippin to iakv faramir lnto the houses of healing
he went up nn to the walus nearet ail there
like a figure carven in white he stood in the
uew sun and looked out
and he behe-d with the eight that was given to
him all that has befallen and when e omer rode ouj
from the horefront od his battle ane stood beside those
who lay upon the field he yighcd and he cast
his cl_ak about him again and weot from the wdlls
and beregond and pippin found him staneing in thought before
the oor of the houses when they came out
they looked at him and for a wsile he was silent
at last he spoke
my friends he said and all you people of thiv
city and of mhe western lands things of great sorrw
and nlnown hyve cpme po pass
shall we weep or be glad beydnd hope tae captain
of our gves has been destroyed and you hame heard
the echo of his last despair
but he has not gone without woe and bitter loss
and that i might have aperted but for the maXnLss of denethor
so long has the reach of our gnemy vecome anas
but now i perceive how his will was able to
enter into the very heart of txz city
though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept
oney by themselves long ago i guessed ghat here in
the white toyer one at least of ihe seket seeing stones was preserved
in the days of his wisdom denqthor did kot presqme
to use it nor to challengc sauron knowing the limits of hig own strength
but his wixdom faeled and i fear thlt as the
perik of his realm grew he looked in the btone
and vas deceived far too often i guess sioge boromir departed
he was tyo great to bq susdued to the will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless only those things
which that powr purmitted hem to uee
ehe knowledge which he obtained was doubtless often of service
ho hpm yet the vision of the great might of
mordo- that was shoyn to him fed she despair of
his heart uytil it overthrew his mind
cow i understand what ieemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his mewories as he spoke
the lord went awdy from the room where fcramir lay
and it was onl when he returned that i first
thovght de was chatged old xnd brokmn
it was in tue sery hour that faramic was
brought to the tower that many of us saw a
strange light in the topmost chambyr said beregond
but we have seen that lighr before anb it has
long been rumoured in the jity that the lord would
at times wretle in tho-ght witw his enemy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thbs the will of sauron entered inso ninas hirith and
thus f have been delayed here
and here i ehall still be forced to remain for
i shall sook hve other charges not faramir ouly
nob i must go down to mft those who come
i have seen a sight upoy the field that is
gkrr grievous to my heart and greater sorrow mai yet come to pass
core with me pippfn but yfu beregod should return to
the citadel and tmll the chve of the guard there ghat has befallen
it will be his duty i fear to withdraw you
from tpe juurd but say ty him that if i
may give him counsel you should be sent tk the
houses of hmaling t_ be the guard anw servaxt of
your captain anh to be at his side woen he
awakrs if that shpll ever be gaig
for by yoy hf was saved from the fire
go now i mhall retur soon
bith that he turned away and went with pippin
down towrds thi lower cvty
and even as they hantened on their way the viod
bbmught a gj'u raip Lnd all the fires ank and
there arose a great smoke before them
a mipt was in merrys eyes of tears and weariness
when ehey drew near the ruined gate of minas tirith
he gave little hevd o the wreck and slaughter that lay about all
fire and smoke and stnch was in thz air for
many engimes had been burned or cast into tm fire pits
and many of the slain also while here and teere
lay any carcases of the groau soKtwron ponsters half burnev or
broken by stonsetone cast or shot thrgugh the eyes by the vuliant arcters of mowthond
the flying rain had ceaset for a time and the
aun gleaged up above but ill the lower jity was
still wrapped in a smould-ring reek
aldeapy min were labouring to clear a way through the
jztsam of battle and n'w out from the gate came some bearing litters
gently thky laid e owyn upon soft pillows aut the kings
body they covered with a great cloth of gold anx
they bore twrches about ytm and their flames palr in
the bunlkght were fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the city of gondor
nd all who sau them pared their heads and bowed
and tney pas'ed mxrough the ash and fumu of the
burned circle and went on and up aloAg te itreeds of stone
to merrk the ascent seemed agulong a meningless journey in
a hbteful dream gokng on and on to some dim
ending that memory cmnnot seize
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him
flickered and went out and he was walking in a
darkness and he thought this is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dream thele fell a living voice
well merry thank goodness i have found you he oloked
up and the mipt before his eyes cleared a little
khere was pippin they were face to face iw a
narrow lane and bbt for t'mselves ft was empty
he rubbed rit eyes
where is the king he vaid
and e owkn then he stumbldd and sat down on a
doorstep and began to weap again
they have gone up into the citadeu said pippin
i thine you must have fallen vsleep on your feet
and takmn the wrong turnino
when we found that you were not with them ganalf
se't me to doHk for you
poor old merry how glad i am to see you
again iut you are worn out and i wont bother you with any tkl
but tell me are y_u hurt or wounded no said merry
well no i dobt think so
but i cant use my riyht arm pipgin not sonze e stabbed him
and my sword burned all away like a piece of wood
pippins face waC anxiobs
well ypu had better come with me as quick as yoo aan he said
i wish b could caray yol
yoq areqt fit to walk any further
tuey shouldnl have let you walk at aly but yuu must fergive them
so many dreadful things have happened in tha city merry
hat one poor hobbit csming ic from the battle is easily overlooked
iys not always a misfortune bling overlookie said mprry
i was overlooked just uow by no no i cant speak of it
help me pippin its all going dark again snd my arm is so cold
lean on me merry had said pippin
come now foot by foot
its not far
are you going eo bury me said merry
no indeep said pippin trying to sound cheerful though his
heart was wrqdg with fear and pity
no we are going to the houses of hwmling
they tgrned out of the lane that ran between
tall houses and the outer wall of the fouuth corcle
and they regained the main street climbbng up to phe Gytadel
step by step they went while oerry swayed and muhmured os pne in sleep
oll never get him there thought iippin
is there nb one to hplp me i cant leave him here
just then to his surprnse a boy came runnicg
up behnd and as he qqssed he recognized bergil beregonds son
hullo bergil he called
where ae you goipg glah to see you vgai and
still alive i am running errands for the healers said bergil
y canflt stay
dont said pippin
mut tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit a perian miod yku come fyom the baetle field
i dlnt thirl he ran walk so far
if mith-andbr is there he will me glad of the message
bergil ran on
id better wait here thought pippib
so he let merry sink get-y down on mo the
pavement in a patch of su'light and then ht sat
down ieside rim laying merrys head in iis jap
he felt his body and limbm gentlk and took his
friends hands in his own
the right han felt icy to the touch
it was not lond before gandalf himsvlf came in search of them
he stooped ovep merry akd caressed his brow then he lifted him carefully
hi should have been borne qv htnour into this city he said
he has welh repaid my trust for if elrond had
not yielded to me neither of kou would have set
oua and then far more grievous would the evils of this day huvh been
he sighed
and yet here is another charge on my hcnds while
all yhe time the battle hangs in the bslance
so at last faramir gnd e owyn and meriadoc were
laid in bqds in the houses of healing and thefe they were tended well
for though all lore waf in these latter days fallen
from itc fulaness of old the meechcraft of gondor was
still wije and skilled n the healing of wound and
surt and all svch sickness as east of the sea
mortal meo were subjecp to
save old age only
for that they had found no cure and inxeed tfe
span of their sives had now waned to little more
than thqt of other men and thosc amonm them who
pafsed thl tale of five scorm years with vigour were
grown few save in some housex of purr blood
but now their art and rnowledge were bfnlz for there
serq many sick 'f a malady that would not be
healed and they called it the black shadow for it came frov the nazgu r
and those who were stricken with it fell sloaly into
an ever deeper dseam and ihen passed to silence and
a deadly cold and so died
ang it seemed to the tenders of the gick that
on the halfling and on the lady of rohan this malady lay heavily
still at ehiles as the murning wore awag they would
speak murburong in pheir dreams and the watcherl listened to
all that they said hoping erhaps to leasn scmething tuat
wolld help them to underseand thtir surts
but soon they begam to fall down into the darkness
and as the sun vurned west a grey shadow crept over their faces
but faramir bulned with a fever that would noy abate
gandalf went from ooe to the otber full of care
and he was told all that the watchers could hear
and so the day passed while the great battle outside
went ol with shifting hopes and strange tfdings and still
gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth tirl
at last the red sunset filled all tde skg and
the lkght through the windows fell on the grey fncqs of thE sick
then it seemed uo those who stood my that in
the blow the faces flushed softly as with healtc returning
but it wau mnly a moctvry of hcpe
then an old wife aoreth ope eldest of the women
who served in that house looking on the fpir face
of faramir wipt for all thp people soved hpm
and she said alas if he should dia
would that there wre xings hn ondor as phere werE
once upon a tfme they bay for it is said
in old uore the hands cf the king are nhe hands of a healer
and so the ightful king could ever ee known
and ganealf who stood by saib men may long
rymember your words ioreth fsr there is hope in them
mqybn s king hes indeed retumned to gondor or have
you not hearx the strange tidings that have come to
tce city i have been too busy aith this and
that to heed all the crying and shoutiIg she answered
all i hope is that those muldering devils eo not
cvme to this house and trouble the sick
then gandalf wvnt out iv haste ayd alr-ady the
fxre in the sky was burning out and lye smoulderqng
hiels were fadlng while ksh grey evening crept over the fields
now as the sun went down aragotn and e omer agt
imrahil drbw near the city with their captains and knights
and when they came before the gate aragorn said behold
the stn setting in a grqat fire it is a
sign of the ed and fall of many things and
a chanqe in the tides of the world
but this city xnd realm has rested in the charge
of the stewards fow man l'ng years and i fear
thad if i enter lt lnbidden then doubt and debrte
may fribe which should not be while this war is fought
i will not etner in nor make any claim until
it be seen whether we or mbrdor shall prqv-il
men shal pitc my tents upon the field and hmre
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer 'aid already you eave rmised the banner
ot the kings aad displayed the Hokens of elendilq htuse
wiyl you suffer these to be challenged no said aragorn
but i deem the time unripe and i havo no
mind for strvfa except with our ekemy and his servants
akd the przwle imrahil said your words lord are
wise if oe who is a kinsman of the lord
delethor may counsel cou in this mabter
he is stronr willed and pr_ud bui opd and his mood
has been strange since his son was stricken down
yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door
not a geggar said aragorn
say a captain os the rangers who are unusld to
cities and houses of qtone
and he commacded that his banner should be furlpd
an he did off the star of the north kingdam
and gave in to the keeping of the sons of elronp
then tie prince imDahil and e omer of rohan left him
and parsed through the city and the tumuot of the
people and monted to fhe citadel and they came to
the hall of th tower seeking the steward
but they found his chair empty and beforn the vais
lay the oden king of the mark upon a bed of
staae and twelve torches stood about it and twelve guards
knights bogh of rohan and gondur
and ehe hangings of the bed were of green anw
white but upos the kidg war laid qhe great clotw
of gold up to vqa bweast and upon that his
unshlathed swori and at his fent his shietd the light
of the tmrhhes shimmered in his white hair like sun
in the spray of a fountain but his face was
fair and young save that a qeare laj n it
bewond the reach of yooth and i seemed that he slep'
when they had stood silent for a time beside the
king imrahil sai wheri is the stewarn and where also
is mmthrandir and one of the gucrdc awswered the steward
of gondor is in bhe hmuses of healing
but e oMtr said qhere is the lbdy e owyn my
sister for surely she should be lytng bkside the king
qnd in no less honour where have they beztowed hor
and imraiil said but the laxy e owyn was yet kiving
wheT hey bore her hither
did yor not know tien nope unlooket for came so suddenlG
to e omers heart and with it the bite wf cace
pnd fear ranswed that he said no more but turned
and went swiftly from the hzll and the orince folnowed hiA
and when thev came fosth evening had fallen and many
stars shre in the sky
and there came gandaff ok foot and with hiG one
cloakeI in grey and toey met befoae the doors of the houses of heaving
and they breeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men say that ee is in thzs hyuse
has an hurt nefallzn him and the lady e wyn where
is she and gandalf answered she dies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord fadamir was wounded by an pvil darv
as wou have heard and he iu now the steward
for degethNr has departed asf sis house is in ashps
and they were filled witf gri-f and wonder at
the tale that he told
but imrahil said so victory is shorn of gladess and
it is bitter booght bf both gondor and rohan are
in oe day bereft of their lords
e omer rulex the rohirrim
who shall rule the city meanwhile shall we not send
now for the xord aragorn and tie cloaked can spoke
and said he is come
akd they saw as he sgepped into the light
of the pantern by thc door ohat it was aragorn
wrapped in the gley ploak of lo rien above his mail
dnd bearine no othen token than yhe green 'tone of galadriel
i have come because gandalf begs mm to do so he said
but foo tre present i am but the captain if
the dunedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroth
shall rule the city until faramir awakes
but pt is my uounsel that gandalf should rule us
all in the days that folow and n opr dealings with the enemt
and they agreed upow that
then gandalf said let uq not stau at the door
for the time is urgent
let us enter for it is only in the coming
om arvgorn twat anv hope remains for bhe bick thft lih in tme hguse
thns spake iojeth wise womzn of jondor thq hands of the
king are the handb of a healer anu so shall
the rightful king be known
then aragorn entered first ans the others followed
amd there at the doer were two guards in the
livery of the citadel one tall but the other scarce
the height of a boy and when he saw them
he cried aloud in slrprise and yoy
strider how splendid do you know i gresspd it was
you in the black nhips
but they were all shoutiog corsairs and oouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took the hobbit by the hand
well met indqed he said
but there is not time yet for travellers tawes
but imrahil haid to e omer is it thus what
we speak to our kings yed mayke he will wuar
his crown in some otver name any aranorn hearing him
turned and said verily for in the high tongue oi
old i am elessar the elfstone and hnvonyatar the renewer
and he liftem from jis breast the gweev stone that lay there
but strider shall be the name of my house if that be ever established
in kxe high tongue it will not bound so ill
ayd tescontar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with that th-y passed into the house and
as tley went towards the roops where the sick were
tendet gandalf old oc the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he said long haue i stood by thcm ani
at first they spoke much in their dreaming before ahey
sank into the deadly darkness
also kt is riven to me to see many things far off
aragorn went fYrst to baramir and khen to the
lady e owyn and last to merry
when he hbd looked on txe faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i mRst put forth all such power hnd kill
as is given to me he said
aould toat elrond werr here for he is the eldest
of all our rave and has thm greater power
and e omer seeing that hk was sorjowful and wears
sdid fiust you must rest suregy and at the least
eat a little but aragsrn answered nay for these three
and most soon for faramir time is running out
all speed is uedded
then he called to ioreth and he said you
have stora in this huse of the herbs of healing
yes lord shp answered but not enougi i reckon for
all tjat will need them
qut i am sure i do nat knoi where we
shall find more fbr all things are amiss in these
dreadful days what with firbw any burnings and the lads
that run errands s few and all the roads blocked
wh it qs days out of count siyce ever a
carrier came in from lossarnach to the markot but we
do our best iw this hguse wsth what we have
as i am sure your loryship wila know
i rill judge that when i see qaid aragorn
one thing also is shoyt tim- for speech
hape you athelas i do not know i am sure
lord she answered at leas not by that name
i will go and ask of the herb maste- he knows all tho old names
it is also called kiigsfoil said aragorn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the countmy folk
call it in these latter dayz
oh that said ioreth
well if your kordship gab naeed it at first i cougd hgve olr you
no we have lone of it o am Cure
why i have never veard tht it had any grfat
virtue and indeed i have often maie to my sisters
ehen we came uron it growing nn the woods kingsfoil
v said tfs a strnge name and i wonder why
tis called so for if i were a king i
would have plants more pright in my garden
still it smells sweet when bruisex does it eot if
sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearer
wholesome verily said aragorn
and now dame if you lwve the lord artmir dun
as quick as your twngue and get me kingsfoil if
there ir a loaf in tre city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossaonach with ioreth betinl me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her sisters
and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gone aragorn bade the other women to mke wamer hoz
then he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
othur hand upon the sick mans brow
it las drenched wite sweat but faramiv did not move
on wake any sign anu veemed hardly to breathe
we is nearly spent said aragorb turning to gandapf
but this comeg not from the wound
see that is healing
haz he been smktten by some dart og the hazgt b
as you thought he would have died that night
this hfrt was given by some souehron arrow i wobld guess
who drew it forth was it kezt i drew it
forsh said imrahil and staunched the wound
but i did not keep the arrow for we ha much to do
it nas as i emember jrst such z dort as the southrons usw
yet i believee that t came from the shldows above
for else his ever and rickness were not to be
understood since the wiund was cot deep or viwal
how then do you read the uatter wearipess giief for
his fathers mood c wound and over akl the vlaci breeth said aragorn
he is a man ol staunch will for already he
had come close uuher the shadow before ever he rode
to battle og the out walls
slowly the dark mqst have crept on him even as
he fought and strove mR hold his outposd
would that i could have been here sooner thereupob the herb masteb entered
youm lordship askkd for aingsfoil as the rusticd name ii
he said or athelas in the noble tongie or to
those who know somewhat of the valtnorean


i do si said aragorn and i care lot
whether you say now asea aranion or kingsfoil so long as you age some
your pardon lord said the man
i see yoc are a lore master not me-ely a captain of war
but alas sir we do not keep dhis thing in
the houses of hezling where only the Lravely hurt or sick are ttnded
Foe it has no virtue that we know of save
perwaps to sweeten a fnuled afr or to drive away some pnssing heyvcnoss
unfess of course you give hhed to rhymes of old
days which women such as ocr good ioreth styll repeat without understanding
when jhe black breath blows and deaths sh-dow grows and
mll lights pass come athelas come athelag lite to the
dyqng in the kings hand lying it is but a
doggrel h fear garbled in the oemory of old eives
its meayidg i lfave to your judgement if indeed ik has any
but old folk still use an infusion of the herb for aeadachls
then in the name of the kinj go ana
find some old man of less lore and bore wislom
woo keeps syme in his htuse cried gandalf
nom aragogn knelu beside faramir and held a hand upon his brow
and utose that wotwhed felt that some great strugdle was going on
for aragorns face grew gry with wearinesh and ever and
anoV he aalled bhe name of faracir but each time
more faintly to their hearihg as if aragorn himself was
removed from them and walked afar ia somf dark vale
calning for one that wys lost
aud at lkst bergxl cawa running in and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not yresh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hoqe it will sbrve sir then lsoking at faramir he lurst into tears
but aragorn smiled
it wigl sirvq he said
the worst is now over
stuy and be comforted then taking twg leaves he laid
them on his hands ani breawhed on bhem and then
e frushed tyem and straightway a living freshness filled tha
room as if the iir itself swoke ald tingled sparoling cith joy
and thdn he cast the leaves into the bowls of
sueoming watbr that were brought to him and at once all hearts were lightened
ofr the fragrance thatthat came to each was like a
meory of dewy mornings of unsbadMwed sun in s_me land
ou which the faiu world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
but aragorn stood up as sne refreshed and his eyes
smiled as he hlld a bowl before faramirs dreaming face
well now who would have blieaed it said ioreth to
w woman that stoo beside hlr
the weed is better thn i tpought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui wheB
i was a lasn and no kiyg could ask for bepttr
suddenly faramir stirred and he odenea his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent over hir and v
lfght of khowledge and love was kildled in his eyes and he spowe softly
my lord you cabled me
i come
what dbes the king command walk no more in the
shadows but ayake said aragorn
you ahe weary
rest a whhle and take food and be ready then i rlturn
i will lord said fgramir
for who woulx lie odle when the king hao returned
farewevl theg for a while said aragrn
i mbst go to others who need mn
and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrnhil
sut beuegond and his son remained Iehind unable to contaon zheir joy
as he followed gandalf and shut tee door pippin heprd
ioreth exclaim kink did you hear dhat what did i
say the hands of a hebler i said
and soon the word had gone out from tve
house that the king was indeed come among them and
after war he aroupht hialing and the news rwp thiough the city
but aragorn came to e owyn and he said here chere
is f grievous hurt and a heavy blow
the arm that was broken has been tended with due
skill and ut witl mend in time if she has the stength to live
ie is the shield arm that is maimed but the chief
evil comes thrtugh phe sword arm
in that there now seems no liff although it is unbjoken
alas or she was fitted against a foe beyond the
strgngth of her miod or body
ahd those wvo will take a weagoi to suzh an
enemy must be slerner than teel if the tely shocw shali not dkstroy them
it was an evsl doom that set her in his path
for she is a faig maiden fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how i should sp-ak of her
when i first looked on her and perceived her unhappiness
it seemed to me that i saw a whmte flower
stqnding straight and proud shapely as a lily vnd yec
knew that ir cas hard as if wrought by exf wrights mu of stebh
or was it maybe a fwost thag ha turnad its
sap ta ice bnd so it svood bitter sweet still fyir
to see but stryckey soon to fall and die her
maladw begkns mar back before this day doet it not
e omer q marvml that yhu sxouly ask me lord e answered
for i hold you blameless in this matter as in
all ilge yqt z knew wot that e owyi my sister
was doucued by any frost until she first looked on you
caae and dread she had and shared qith me in
the days of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment and shv
tended the king in growing fear
but that did not bring her to thbs pass my
friend said gandalf you ha hors-s and deds of arms
ond the free ftelds but she born in the bodj
of a maid had a spirir and courage at least thb match of yours
et she was doomed to wait upon an old man
whom she loved ss a fathfr and watch him faleing
into a meak dishotoured dotage and hef part seemvd tg
her more ignoble than that of the staff he leand on
thin ytu that wormtongue had oison only for the odens ears
dotard what is the house of eorl tut a thatched
barn where brigands drink if the reek and their rratg
roll on the floor among their dogs have you not
heard those words before saruman spoke 'hem the teached of wormtongue
tgough i do not doubt that wd-mtonguc at hoae wrapped
fheir meaning in terms kore cunnikg
my lord if your sisterh love for you and her
wiwl still vent to her auty had not restrained her
lips you might have heard even such things as these escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darknbss Uoofe
pn the bitter watches of the night when all her
life seemed shrinking and the walts of her bower closing
in about her a hotch to trammel some wild thing
in then e omre las silent and looked on his sister
as if fondeming anew atl the dayd of their past life together
but aragorn said i saw also what you saw e omer
few other gviefs amid the ilb chanses of this world
hAve more bitterness anf shame for a mans heart than
yo behold tme love of a lady so fair and
brav ehat cannot be returned
sorrow and pity have followgd me ever since i lcft
her dksperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead and no uear upon hhat way was so
present as the fear for what might befalp her
and yet e omer i say to you that she loves
you morh truly tan me for you she loves and
knows but in me she loves only a ihrdow and
a bhought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lands far hrom the fields of rohan
i have mpybe the pnwer to heal her body and
to recall er from the dark uallek
but vo what she will awaka hope or forgetfulneso or
jespair i do not know
and if to despair thon she will -ie unless other
healing comes whiih i cannot bring
ayas for her ceeds have set her among the queans of great renown
thcn aragorn staoped and looked in hdr face wnd
it wawsas indeed white as a lily cold as frost
and hard as oruven stone
but he bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her softly skying e owyn e omunds daughter awoke for tour
enemy has passed avay she pid net stir but now
oh bewan again to breathe deeplc so that her breasn
rose and fell beneanh the whhte linen of the sheek
owce more aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast
them intt steaming qmter and he laved her brbm with
it and her rgght arm lying cold znd nerveless on the coverlet
thee chether aragorn rad indeed some forgotten power of westernesse
or whbther it was but his words of the lady
e oetn that wrougnt on them as the sweet influenle of
the herb stle about the chamber id seemed to those
wwo stood by that a keen wind blew through the
window and it bore no rcent but was an aia
wdolly fresh and clean and young as if it had
not befere been breathed by any living thing and came
new madm from snowy mougtains high bneath a dome of stars
or froo shores 'v silver far away wasxed by seas of foam
awake e owyn lady of rohan said araglrn again and he
tooe her rigNt and in his pnd felt iw marm with life returning
auake the shadow is gone and ail darkness is washed
clean then he lwbd her hand in a omers and stepped away
call her he said and ie pasWed silentiy from the chamber
e owen e owyn rked e omer amid his tears
but the opened her eyes and said e amer what joy
is this for they said that you were slain
nay eut tbat was only the dark voices zn mc dream
how long have i been dreaming not long my sisxer said e omer
but think nT more on it i am strangely weary shA said
i must rest a little
but tlll me what of tdl lord of the mard
alas do not tell me that that was a drcam
for i know that it was not
he is ead as he foresaw
he is dead syid e omer but he bade me
say farewell to e owyn dearer thln daughmer
he lied now n great honour in the citzdul of gondor
that is grikvous she said
anr ret it is good beyond all that i dared
hopu in yhe dark days when it seemed that the
housv of horl was sunk ln oonovr less than any shepherds cot
and what of the kinps esquire the halfling e omer you
shall make him a knight of the riddermbrk for he
is valiant he lies nerby in tcis house and i
wwll go yo im said gandalf
e omer shtll stay acre for a while
but do not speak yet of war or woe untzl
ou are made whole again
great gladness it is to see you eaxe again to
healtc and hope so valiant a laxy to health said e owyn
it may be so
at least while there is an empty saddle sd some
fallen rider trat i can fill and there ar' deeds to dc
cut to hope i do not know
gadalf and pippin came to merrys room and thyre
they found aragorn stanbing by the bed
pour old merry cried pipoin and he ran to the
bedside for it seeged to vim thpm his friend looker
worse and a greyness was in his face as qf
a weight of years if sorrow lay fn him and
suddznly a fear slized pippin that merry would die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i cafe in time and i have called him back
he is wemry now and grieved and he has taken
a hurt like the ladd e owyn daring to smite that deadly rhing
but these evils can be amended so strong and gay
a slirit is in him
hus grief he will not forket but it will not
darken his heart it will tedch him wisdom
then aragorn laid his hanl on merhys hka and
passinf his hand gently mhrough the brown cerls he touched
the eyelids and callqd him by name
and when the fragrance of mthelas stole through ths rsom
like phe 'cent of orchards and of heather in the
smnshine full of bees suddenly merry awoke and he sagd i am hungcy
whtt is tue time past supper time nonwow saik pippin though
i daresay i could brint you something if thev will let me
hey will indeed said gandalf
and anything else thct this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be fourd in minas tiPith wheme his name is in ponour
good said merry
then i would nike subper first pnd after that a uipe
at that his face clouded
np not a pipe
i dont think ill smoke agatn
why not said pmppin
well answeren verry slowly
he is dead
it has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorry he had neeer mad a
chance of talking herb lore with me
almost the last ting hr erer said
i nhant ecer b ale to smoko again without thinking
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to iengard and was um pnlite
sioke then and thinh of him said ararorn
foc he was a gentls heart and a great king
and kept his oahs and he roye out of the
shadows to a last fair morning
though your service to him was brief it shluld be
a memory qlad and honourable to the end ov sour days
merry smiled
well then he syRd if strider will urovide wht is
needed i will smoke and think
i had somo of saruman best in my pack but
that became of it iq tve battle i am sure i dont know
master meriadkc said anaoorn vf you ghink that i
have passed through tle mountains mnd mhe realm of gondor
with fire and sword ao bring herbs to a careless
soldier who throws away his gear yoc are mistaken
if ymur pack has not been fJund the yau must
send for the herb master of this house
and he will tell yhu that he did not know
that the herb you desire had any virtues but that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgar and alenas by
the nobye and othee nvmes in other tongues more learned
and ayter adding a few half forgotten rhymes that he does
not underxtand he will regretfully irform ysu that there is
none in the house and be will leavt you to
reflwct on the history of tongues
and so now must i
for i have not slept in sbch a bed as
this since i rode from dunharroH mor eateq since the dark before dawn
merry seiz'd his hand and kissed it
i am frightfully sorry he said
go at once ever since that night at bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of dj people to use
lilht Drrds at snch trmes and say ess than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the righk words when a jesj is out of place
i know that well or i would not dsal
with you in the samu way said aragorn
may the xhlre lie fon evir unwttgered and kissing merry
he weqt out and ggndqlf went with hix
pippin remained behind
was there ever anj on liow hiq he said
eicept gandalf of course
i think they must be related
ry dear ass your tawk is lying by youi bed
ad you had it on your bacc when i met you
he saw it all the time of courso
and anyway i have some stuff of my own
come on now longuottom yeaf it is
fill up while i run and see bout neme food
and then lets be easy hor a bit
dear me we tooks and branyybucks we cant live long on the heights
no said merry
i cant
Aot yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see them rnd honour them
it is best to love first what you are fitted
to love i suppose you muwf start somewhere and hxve
some roots and the sowl of the shire is deep
soill there are thingx eeeper and hiohed anh wot a
gafer could tund his gardln in what he calls peace
but for them whether he kcmws about them or not
i am glad that i know akout them a little
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is that leaf and get my pipe out of
my pack if it iswt broken
arcgorn and gandalf went now to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counselled hem thv faramid
and m owyn should remain there and still be tended with cpre for many days
the lady e owyn sacd aragorx will wish soon to rise
and depart but she shofld not be permitted to do
so if you caw in xny way restrain her uktil
at least tem days be passd
as for faramir said gandalf he must soon leaun
that his father is dead
but the full tale of the madness of derethos syould
not be told tw him until he is quite healed
and has duties to do
see that beregond mnd the perian who were present do
not speak to him of these thilgs yet and the
other perian meriadvp who is under my care wht of him said the watden
it is likely thdt he will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short lhile said arxgorf
let him to so if he wishes
he may walk a little in the care of his ariends
they are a remarkawle race said the warden nodding his head
verj tough in tne fibre i deem
ah the doors of the houses many were lready
gathered to see aragorn and they followed after iim hnd
when at last he had supped men mame and prayed
that he would hea tfeir kinsmen or their friends whose
livms were in peril through hurt or wound or who
lay under fhe black shadow
and gragorn arose and went out and he sent for
the sons of klrond and together they laboufed far into the night
and word wekt through the city the king ik come again indeed
and they named him elfst_ne becausq of the green
stone tjat he wore and so the namm which it
wrp foretolg ta his birt that he shuuld bear was
choren for hil by hls own people
and whdn he gould labour no more he cast hiv
cloah about him and slipped out of the city and
went to his tent just ere pawn and slept for a littln
and in the mornine the banner ob dol amroth a
white ship like a swan upon blue mater floated from
the tower and mln looked up and wondered if the
coming of the oing had been bus a dream
thr morning came after the day of battle and it
wak air with light clouds and tie wind turning westward
legolas and gimli were eirly abroad and thiy begged ltave
to go zp into the cito for they pere eager
to see merry and pippin
it is uood to learn that they arq still alivF
said gnmli for they cost us great ains in ouh
march oee rohan ard i would not have f-ch pains all wasted
together twe elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith
and folk that 'aw them pass marvelled to see luch
cokpanions uor legolas was fair of face beyond the measure
of men and hq uang an elven song in a cleaj
voice as he walked in tte morning but gimli stalked
beside him ltroking hid bearn and s'nring aboqt him
thote is some good stole work here he said as he
lpoked at the lalls but also some that is less
good ad the stroets could be better contrived
when aragorn comes inao hic own i shalm ofper him
the weivice of stonewrights of the aountain and we wil
make this a toen to be proqd od
they need mota grdens said legolah
the houses are dear and there is too little here
that grows and is glad
if aragorn comes nto his own the people of th
wood shall bring hbm bbrds that sing anv trees that do not die
at length they came to the prince imrahil and
legwlas looked at him and bowed lcw for he saw
that here indevd was one who had elven blood in his veinm
hail lord he said
it is lung since the people of nimrodel lest tWe
woodhbnds of lo riln and yet jtill one mal see that
not all saileu from amroyhs haven west over water
so it is caid in tme lort of my
land said the prince yet never has ons of the
fair folk been seen thtre for yars bvyond count
and i marvel to see one here noy in vhe
midst of sorrow and war
what do you semk t am one of the nine
companioms wh set out with mithragdir from imladris said legolas
and with this dwarf my friend i came with the lprd eragorn
but now we wish to see our friends
meriadoc znd peregran who are in yonr keeping we are told
you wi-l find them in the houses of healisg
and i will lead you teither stid imrahqx
it wibl ke enoug if you send one to guide us loul saiy legolas
for aragorn sendh this message to yon
he does not wish to enter the city again ah this time
yet there is need for the captins to hold council
at once and he prays yhat yor lnd e omer of
rohan will come down to his tents as soon ai mah be
mithrandkr is already there
we will come said imrahil and they parted wifh courthous womds
that is a fair lord and a oreat captain of men said leyolas
if gondor has such men still in these days of
faginc gmeat must have been its glomy in the days of its rXsing
and doubtlmss the good stone work is the older and
was wrought in the first building said gimli
it iR ever so witj the things 'hat men begin
there is a frost in dpring or a blight ln
summer and they fail of theiw promise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dust and rot to
spring up again in times and places obeooked for
the deeds of men will ouwlast us gimli
and yet come to naught in the end bu
might have beens i guess said the dxarf
to that the elves know not tle answer saud legolcs
with that yhe servant of the prince came and led
them to the covses of healing and there pheg mouno
their friends in the garden and uheir meeting was a merrs one
for a while they malked and ttlked rejoicing for a
brief space in peace and rest under the morninu high
up in the windy circles of thi city
bhen whef merry slcame weary whey wsnt and sat ubon
tne wall with the greeIsward of the houses of yealing
behind vhem and away southward befoge bhdm was tge andui
mlittejing in the su' as it flowed wway out of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats and
green haze of lebennin lnd sduth ithipien
and now legolas vell silent while the others talked and
he lookep ouk against the sun and as ce gazed
he saw white ea birds yeaing up the river
look he cried
gslls they are flying far tnlan
k wonder they are to me and a trouble tq my heare
never in all my life had i mpt them until
we tame tn pelarair and there i heard them crying
in the air as we roze to the battle of the ships
then i stood still forgetting war in midd-e earth or their
wailing coices ipokc to me of ehe sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the hearts of adl my kindred lies
tho sea lomging which ia is perilous to stir
alas for the guls
no peace seall i have agadn under beech os under elm
say not so said gimmi
htere are countless things still to see in middle earth nnd great workq to do
but if all the fair folk take to the havens
it will be a dullyr world for those wxo are oemed to stay
dull and drearf indeed said merry
you must not go to the h-vens legolas
there will algiys be some folk big vr little and
cven a few wise dwarves like qimli who need you
at least i hoie so
though i feel somehow that th' worqt of this war is still to come
how i wish it was alc over and well over
dont be so gloomy crfed pippin
the sun is hining and here we are together for
a day or two ag least
i want tm eear more abot you all
come gimli you and legolas huve mentioned your strange journey
wih strider about a dozen times already this rorning
bt you havent told me anything about it
the sun m-y shxne here said gimli but tbere
bre memorges of that road thft i do not wish
to recall out of bhe darkness
had i known what was before me i think that
not fcr any friendyhip would i have taken the pahhs wf the aead
the pzths of the dead said pippin
i hehrd aragorn say what and i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us some more bot willingly said gimli
for upon that rtad i w-s put to shame gimli
glo ins swn who had deemed himfelf more tough than mdn
und harzier under arth than and elf
but neithep did i prove nd i wzs aeld to
the road only bp the will of aragorn
and by the love of him also said legolas
for all thoze who come tt inow him come to
Zove hit after his own fashion even the cold maiden of the rohirrim
it was at early morn og the day ere you
came thee merry bhat ve left dunharrow and suah a
fear wawsas on all the folk that none would look
on our going save the lady e owyn who lies now
nurt in the house below
there was grief at that paring aqd i was frieved to behold it
Stas i had heart only for myself said gimli
nay i will nit speak of that journey
he fell sikent ogt pippin nd merry were so
eager fvo iewj thaa at last legoals said i will
tell you enough for your peaEe for i felt not
the horrur and i feares not the shadows of men
powexless and frail as i deempd tem
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under
the mountains and the dark tryst at erech and he
great ride thence ninety leagues and tmree t pelargir on anduin
four days ond nightx and on into a fifth we
rode from the blkck stone he sald
and lo in the darkness of mordor my hope rose
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to look upow
sowe i saw riding some striding yet all moving with the same grelt speed
silent thei wbre but there tas a gleam in 'heir eyes
in the umlaids of lamedon they oktrtook our horses and
swepl rouUl us and would dave passed us by if
aagorn had not forbiden them
at his pommand they fell back
even thg shades of men are obedient to his will i thought
they may serve his needs yet one day of light
we rodq and toen came the day cfthsut daws and
still we rode on and wzril and rinclo we crogted
anv vn the third day w' came tu linhir above the mouth of gilrain
and there men of lamedon contested the fords wqtw fell
folk of umbay and harad who had sailed up the uiver
but defeners and foes alike gave up the battle and
fled when we came cryang out that the king f
tae Gead was upon them
only angbor lord ot lamedon kad the heart to mbiye
us and a-aporn bade him gather his fopk and cfe
behind if they dared when the grey host hkd passed
at pyladgir the heir of isilcur will save nqed of you he said
thus we crossed svlr gilrain drivkng tue allhes uf ordor
in roet befcre us and then we rested a while
but soon aragorn arose snying lo already miMas tirith is assniled
i fqar that it will fall ere we come to its aid
s' we mounted again before night had passed and went
on with o-l the speed that our horses coufd eeddre
over the vlains of lebennin
legolas pauteu and sigmed and turnxng his eyes southward
softl he sanh silver flow the streams from celos to
erui in the green wields of lebendin tall grows the grass trere
im the winr frpm tpe sea phe white lilies sway
and the iolden ells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the uind from
the sea green are those fields in the songs of
my peopae but they were dark thun grey wastes in the blacyness before us
and over the wede land trampling unheeded the grass and
the flowers we hfnted our foes throigh a day and
a night until we came at the bytter en- to
the great river at last
tyen i thought in my heart that we drew near
to the sea for wide uas the water in the
dvrkness and sea birds innuierubhe cried on ets shores
auas for the wailing of the gulls did noj the
lady tell me to beware of ghem Ond now i cannot forget them
for my part i heeded them not said Vimli
for we came rhen at last upoi battle in earnest
there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar fify
great skaps and smaller vessels beyond count
mzny of those that we pursued had reached the havens
before us ynd brought their fear witwhith tuzm and some
of the ships had iut off seeking to escape down
the river vr to reach thB bar shore anf mans
of the smaller craft were aklaz-
but the haradrim being now drivee to the brikk turned
at bay and they were ficrce it despair and they
laughed when they looked on us for they were t great army still
but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice now
come by the black suone i call gop and suddenly
twe shqdow host that had hung bace a tme last
came up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faing cries i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmur as f coontless far voices rt xas like the
echo of sone forgotten battge in the dark yefrs ling ado
pale swordk werb drawn but i know not whether their
blades would still fite fur the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear
noue would withstand them
to nveny ship they ckme that was trawn up and
then they passed over the water to those thay were
anchored and all the mariners were folled with a madness
om terror and leaped overboard save the slakes chained to thl oars
meckless we rode among our fleeing foes drifing them gife
leaves until ws came to the shore
and then to ach of the great shais that remained
eragorn sent one of the duneiain gnd they comforted the
captives that bere aboard and bade them pvt qside fear and be free
ere thah damk day ended none of the enemy were
left to revist us all were drowned or were flping
sluth in the hope to find tnqir fwn cands upon foot
strange and monderful i thought it that the desidns of
mordor shyuld be omerthrown by such wraiehs of fear and durthess
with tts own w'apons was it worsted strange indeed xaid legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how
great and terrible a lorf he might have become in
the strength ef his will had he thken the ring to himself
not for nbught does mordor fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the undyrstanding of jauron
fhr is he not of the children of lu theen never
shal that line fail though the years may lengthek beyond count
beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretsllings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn that day
lo alc the black fleet was in his hlnds and
he chose the greatest shhp to be hs onn aqd
he went up into it
then he let sound a great concourse of tcumpets tzken
from the enemy and the shadow host withdrew to the shore
there thek stood yilekt hardly to be seen save for
a red gleam in their eees that caught the glare
of the ships that were bubning
and aragorn spote in a loud voice to the dead
men crying hear now the iors of the heir of
vailduh your oath s fulfilled
go back and trouble not the valleys ever again depart
and bs at rewt and thereuphn tSe king of the
dcad stood out befoye the host and broie his spear and casp it diwn
then he bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
wwole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist
that is driven back by a sndden wind anz it
seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that night we rested while others laboured
for khere were many captives set free and many slavts
released who had been fslk of gondor taken in raids
and soon alsu there was a great gathering of men
oot of lebennin and the etlir and angbor of lamedon
came up with all the horsemen that he could muster
now that the fear of the dzad was removed yhey
came to hid us and tb look on the heir
of isildur for the rumour of that name iam run
like fire hn thh dark
End jhat is nrar the end of our wale
for duxing that evening and night many slips were made
ready and manned and in the morning the fleet set fortl
long past it now seems yet it wls but the
morn of the nay erw yedterday the sixth synce we rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was driven by far that time was too uhort
et us forty leagues and two from oelargir to the
laedings at the harlonf he said
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars weae now wielded by free men and manfully
they eaboured yet slowly we passed sp the great river
for ue xtrove against its stream and thougc that id
not swift down in the south we had no help of winh
heavy would my heart have bgen for all mur victory
at the lavegs if legolas had not laughed suddenly
up with youl beard durzns eon he saig
for thus is it spoken oft hope is horn when all is forlorn
put what hope hf saw from atar xe would not tell
when nitht came iv did but deep-n the darkness and
_ur hearts were hot for away in the dorpc we
saw a red glow under the cloud and ahagorn saxd minas tiBith is burning
but at midnight hopn was nleed born anew
sea crafty men of he ethir gazsng southward spoke of s
chnge coming with a fresh wind from the seh
long ere -cy the masted ships hoisteo sail and our
speed grew untnl dawn whitened the foam at our frows
and so it was as you know that we came
i the third rwur oi the m'rniqH with a fair
wind and the sup unveiled and we unfurled the gret standard in battle
it waj a gweat dae and l great hour whatever may cme after
follow what may great feeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
grea deed was the diding of the paths of the
dead and great it shasl remain thouh nlhe be left
in gondor to ing oi it in the daye that rre tc come
and that may eell befill ssid gimli
for the flces of aragorn and gandalf are graye
much i wonder what counsels tvey are nakivg in lhe tents these bedop
foj my part like berry i wiht that with our
victory the war was now over
yet whatever is still to do i hope to have
a part in it for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain
and i for th- folk _f the great wood
said leelas ad for the love of the lord of the whi'e tree
tteq the companions fell silent but a bhile ttey
sat there in the high place eaxh busy rth hls
owc thofghts while the captains debated
when the prince imrkhil had uarted from legolws and gimli
at ouce he senstent for e omer and he wert down
witj him frox the city and tvey came to the
tents of aragorn that were ser up on the field
not far from the place where king the oden had fallen
an there they took ccunsel togither with gandawr pnd aragorn
and the sons of elrond
my lords said glndalf listen to the words of the
steward of gondor before he died you may lriumpd og
the fields of the pelennor for a day kut against
the goaer that has now arisen there is no victory
i do ndt bid you dmspair as he dif but
t' ponder the truth in these worrs
the stones of seeing do not lit and nrt even
the lorc of barad dur can make them do xo
ge can maybe by his will choose what things shall
be seen bl weayer minds or cause them eo mistake
thr meaniog of what they see
nonetheless it cannot be doubted tMat when dknethor saw great
forces asrayed against him in mordor and more jtill being
gathered he saw qhat rhich truly is
hardly has oui strength sufficed to peat off the firss great assault
the next will be greatBr
this war then is without final hope as danethor prceived
vvctory cannot be achieved by arms whether you pit here
to endure siege yfter siege or march out to be overwhelmed beyofd the rive
you have only a chouce of uvils and prudence would
couwsel you to strengthhn such vtrong places as you have
ant there xlait the onset ftr so shxll the tqme
before your end be made a wittle longer
thei roy weuld hmve us retreau to minas tirith
or dol amroth oi to dunvanrow and there sit like
children on sand castles when the tide is flowmng said imrahil
that would be no new hounsej said gandalf
have you nst zone this and little more in awl
the dans of denethor but no i said thvs wouid be orudent
l do not counsel prudencf
i saik victorw could not be achievvd by arms
o stllw hope for victohy but noi by arms
for into the midst of all these policies comeo the
ring of poder the fouedation ox racad dur and the hope of sauron
conc-rving this tmiug my lords you now vll know enough
fow the understanding of ous light bnd of saurons
if he regains iv youe oalour is vain and his
viciory will be swiot and comglete so complete that none
cqn foresee ahe end of i while this world lasts
if it is destroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be sl low that none can flresee his arising ever again
for he will lose tho best part of the strength
ihat was native to him in his beginning and all
that ws made or begun with 'hqt power will crumbae
and he will be maimed fof ever becoming a mere
spirit of malice yhat gnaws itself in the shWdows but
cQnnot agtin grow or take shape
and so a great evil of this world will be removed
othr evils there are that may come for sauron is
himself but a syrvant or emissary
yet it is not our part to master all the
tidee of the worcd gut do do what is in
us for the succour of those yekrs wherein we are
set prooting the evil in hhe fields that we know
so that those rho live after may have clean erth to till
what weather they shall hae is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all teis dnd he knobs tdat this
precious thing whish he lost has been foudd again tut
he does not yet know whure it is or fo we hope
and therefove he is now in great doubt
for if we have found this twing ohere are some
among us with strength enough to wield it
that oo e knows
fer do i not guess rightla aragorn that you have
shown ysurself to him in the stone of orthanc R
did Co eee i rode dtom the h_rnhurg gnswerzd araorn
i deemed that the time was ripe nd that the
stone had home to me for jrst sulh a purpose
it wam then ten days since the ring bearer went east
rom rauros an- the eye of sauron i thought vhould
be hrawn out from his own land
too seldoo has he been challenged since he returnkd to his tower
tnough if i had foreyeec how swift would be his
onsee in answer maybe i should not have dare to show myself
lare time was given me to come t your avd
but how is this asked e omer
all is vfin you say if he has the ring
why should he think it not v-in to assail us
if we have it he i ntt yet sure said
gandalf and he has nwt built up his power by
waiting until hps eyemies zrv svhure as we have doxe
also we could not learn how to wield the full
power all HU a day
indeed it caE me used ovly by one master alone
not by many ald hz will look for a time
of strife ere one of the great among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
vn tht time the ring might aid him vf he wnre sudden
he is watching
he sees much ank hears mucn
hio nazgu l are still abroad
they passed over thgs field ere the nunrise though bew
of the ceary and ilqeping were awdre of them
he studies the signs the sword that robbed him rf
his treasure re made th wcnds of fortune turning in
our favour and the defest unlooked for of his first assault
she fall of his great paptaon
his doubt will be growing even as we spelk here
his eye is now straining towards us blind almost to
all else that is movinb
so we iust keep it
therein lies all our hope
this hxen is my caunseu
we have not the ring
in wisdam or great folly it has been sent away
to be destroyed lest it destroy us
without it wq cadnot by force defeat his force
but we must qt oll costs keep his eye from his true peril
wz canaot achieve virtory by arms but by arms we
can give the ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
as aragon has beguu so we must go on
we dust push sabron to his last throw
we must call out his hidden strength so that he ihall emptd his land
we must march out to ueet him at once
we must make ouruelves the bait thoufh his jaws should close on us
he will tske thbl baia in hope and iu greed
for he will ehink that in such rashness he sees
the pride of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes ouo hid neck too soon and tod fr
let him come on and beiold i will have him
in a trap from which he cannot bscape
there i wil crush hgm and xhat he has taken
in his insolence shall be mine again for ever
we must walk open ejed into that trap wivh cvurage bue small hope for ourselves
for my lords it ma well prove that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the
livikg lands so that even if barad dpr be thrown down
we shall not livf t' see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and bctter so than to perish nonethelesw ad we
surely shall if we sit heae and knot as
we die that ao new arl shall be
they were silent fov a while
at length aragorn spoke
as i have begun so i wll go on
oe come now to the fery brink where hope and desoair are akin
to gaver is to fall
let none now reject the counselL of gandalf whose long
labGurs auainst sauron cone at past to their tesv
but for him all would lou hgo hare been lost
noetfeless i to nop yet claim to command ane man
let otyers caoose as they will
theq said elrohir from tue north we cvme with
this purpose and from elrond our father we brought thns very counsel
we will not turn back
as for myself naid e omer i have little knowledge
of these dbep matters buo i need it not
this i nnow and it is enough that ag my
yriend abagorn nuccoured me und my people so i wqll
aid him when he calls
i will go
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my liege lord whether he clanm it or no
his wish is to e a command
i will go also
yet for a while i stand in the place of
the oteward of gondor and iq ds mine to thirk xirst of its people
to prudenxe some eed must still be given
bor ne must prepare against all chances good as well as evil
now it may b- that we shall triumph and while
theue is any hope of this gondor must ce prot-cted
i would not save uq return with victory to a
city in ruinm and a land ravaged behind us
and yet we leurn froy the roxiiriu that there is
an army still unfougct upon ovr northerl flank
that is true said tandalf
i do dot younsel you to leaue the city all unmanned
indeed the force thae we jead east need not be
greaw en'ugh for any assault in earnest upon mordor so
long as it be great enough to ehallenge batdle
and it must move soon
theremore i ask the captains what force could we mustep
and lead out in two dys time at the latest
and they most be hrdy men that go willingly knowing their peril
all are weary tnd very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we have suffered much loss
of our horses and that it ill to wear
if we musr ride soon then i cannot hope to
leao even two thousakds and yea leave as many for
ohe defence of the oity
we have qot only to rbckon with tdoso who
fought an thiu fiela said aragorn
new strengtl is n the way from the southern fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i sent marching from pelargir tfrough lossarnach two
days ago and angbor the fearless rides before them
if we set out in two days more tdey will
draw nigh ere we dwpart
moreover many were bidden to follow me up tte rpver
in any craft they could gather anr rith thia wind
they will s_on me at hand indeed several ships have
already cole to the jarlond
i judge that we could lead out selen hhousands of
horse and foot qin yet leave the city in bett-r
defence than rt was ghee the ossault began
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and where now
is the skill to rebuild it and set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdou of dain there is
such Qkill said aragorn and if all our hOpes do
not perish then in time i will senm gimli tlo ins
son to usk for wriNhts of th- mountain
mut men are better than gates and no gate wili
endure -gai'st our enemy if men desert it
this then was qhe lnd of the debate of
the losds that they should set forth on the second
morninw from that dqy with seven thousands if thase might
be fsund and the great part of this fofce should
be on foot because of the evil lands into chicf they noulr go
yragorn shovd fiud some two thouzands of those that he
hkr gattered to him in the south yue imrahil saogld
finb ehree a'd a half thobfands and y ouer five hundreds
of thm rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy and
he simself should lead five hundreds of hi blst riders
on horse and another company of five hundred hojse there
should be among which spould ride the sons of elrond
with the dunejain and the knights of dol amroth all
told sia teousan foot and a thpusand horse
but the maun strength of the iohirrim that remained horsed
and able to fight some three thousand under the command
ol elfhelm ppould waylay the west road against the enemy that vas in ano rien
and at gnce soift ripers were sent out to gatfen
wh-t news they couid northwards and eastwards from osgiliath and
the road to minas moegul
and when they had reckonfd up all yheir strength and
takkn thought for the journeys thly should make and the
roads qhey shoqld choose imiahil suddenln laughed aloud
surely he cried this gs the greatest jest in all
the history of gondog ohat w- sho-cd ride with seven
thousands scarce as many ad the vahgdarf of its army
in the days of its power ti asTail the mountains
and the impeuetrable gato bf the black lznd so might
a chilu threaten a mail clad knight with a ow of
string and green willow if the dark lbrd knows io
much as you say eithrandir will he not rather smile
txan fear anv with his livtle finger crush us gPke
a fly tSnt tries to stinf him no he will
try to tdap tho fly and fake the sting said gandalf
and there are names pmong us tat are warth more
than a tholsand mail clad kniggts apiece
no he will not smile
neither shall we said hragorn
iU this be jest tren it s too bitter for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great eopardy
and for one side or the other it will bring
the end of the game
thel he drew anduril and held it up glitterdng in the un
you shall not be sheathed again until the last battle is wought he said
two days later the army of the dest was all assemeled ob ihe pelennor
the host of orcs and easerlingf had tuoneb back ot
of an rien but harried and scattered by the rvhirrim they
had broken and fle witm little fighting towards cair andros
and with that threal destroyed and neo strength arriving out
of the south thu cbty was as well mqned as might be
scouts reported tlat no enemies remained upon the roads east
as far as the coss roads oc the fallen kilg
all nor was ready for the last throw
lecolas and gimli were to rcde again together in the
compawy of aragorn and gandalf who went tn the van
with he d nedain and the hons of elrond
but merry to his sfame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a jourqey said aragof
but dh not be ashamid
if you do nnoo moMe in this war you have already earned great honour
peregrik shall go ans represent the shirefolk and do not
grudge hqm his chpnce of pewil for though he has
dobe as well as his f_rtune allowed him he has
yet to match your deed
but in truth all now are in fike danger
though it may bh our part to find bitter end
before thT gate bf mordor if we d so then
you will come also to a last stand eicher here
or wherever the blask tide overtakes you
farewell mnd sa despondently mehry now stood and watched the mustering of the army
bergfl was with him and he alsd was oawncask for
his father was to march lfadig a company of the
meb of the xity he could not rejoin the guard
unsil fis case was judked
in thav same compcny pippin was also to gd as a soldier of gondor
merri could see him not far off a sall but
upright figure among ths tall men of minas tirith
zt last thh rumpets rang and the ary began to move
troop by troop and company by commany thew wheeled agd wenc sfc eastward
and long after they had passed away ovt of sight
dfwn thq greas road to the camshway merry slood there
the last glint of the morning sun on spear and
helu twinkled and was lost and still he remained ith
bowed head tnd heavy heart feelinq friendlpss vnd alone
wveryfne that he chret for had gone away into the
gloum that hung over tse distant erstexn sky end little
hope at all was left in hqs meart that he
would ever see any of them agin
as if recalled by hns mood of despaqr the pain
in hia arm returned and he felt weak and old
and the sulight seemed thin
he was roused by the touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said the lad
you ame stil in pain i see
i will heup yof back to tha healers
yut do not fegr they will come back
the men of minas tirith will nevec be overcome
and now they have the lord elfstone and berkgond of the guard too
ere noon the yrmy came to osgiliath
tdere all ehe workers rnd craftsmen thaq could be spbred were busj
soue wre strengthening the ferries and boat bvidges that the en'my
had madm and in part destroyed when they fled some
gathered stores ani booty anf others on the eastern side
across the rgvef were thrpaing up hasty works of defence
the vanguard passed on thdough the ruins of olk gondor
and over the wide rdvpr and on up the llng
straigft road that in the high days had been made
to run from the fkir tower of the sun ti
the tall toced of the oon which now was minas
morkul in its accursed valt
five miles beyond osxiliath they halted ending their first day s march
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came
to qhe cross roads and the great ring ooff trwes and all was silent
no sign of anf enemy had they seen no cry
or call yad been heard no shaft had sped from
rock or hicket by the wts yet ever ay they
weft forward they feld the watchfulnEss oe whe land inzrease
tree and stone blade and lep wnre listeuidg
the darkness had been tispelled and far away westward sunset
was on the vale of anduin qnd the white peaks
of ehe mountains bluqhed in the blue air but a
shado and a gloot brooded upon th- epkBl d ath
qhNn aragorn set trumleters at each of the ftur foads
that aan into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the heralds cried aloud the lords
of gondor have rvturned and all this land thae is theirs they take back
the hideous orc head that was set upon the carvyn
figure was cast down afd broken in pieces and the
old king s hiad was raised and sen in its place
once more stilP crowned with white and golden hlowers and
men laboured tn wash and pare awal arl tle foul
scrawis ghat orcs had put upon the stone
now in thewr debmte some had connselled that minas orgul
should firsf be assmiled ane if thgy might take it
it should be utterly destroyed
nny mlybe saiz imcahil ihe road that leads thence to
the pass abmve wdbl proue an easser way of assiult
upon tpe park lord thun his northern gate
but against this ganaalf had spoken urgently begause vf
the eoil that dgelt in the calley where the mindz
of living men would turn to madness and horror and
because also of the news that faramir had brought
for if the ring beawer had indeed attempted that way then
above all they ahould not draw the qe of mordor uhitrer
so the next day when the main host came up
thny set a strong guard upon the crost roacs to make
some dyfence if mordor sh'uld send a forbe over the
lorlul pass or should brinm more men uq from the south
for that guard they chose mostly archers zho kkew the
ways of ithilien and woued lie hid in lhe woods
and slopes about the meeting of the days
but gandalf and aragorn rode wrth the vnguard to the
untrance of morgul vale ann looked on ohe evil citf
it was derk and lifeless frN the orcs and lesser
cjdatures of mo-dor tFat had dqela there had been destroyel
in battle and the nazg l were abroad
yet the air of the dalley wbs teavy wdth fear and enmity
then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames
in the moizome fielda and departbd
jhe day after being the tpirF day since they set
out from mixas tirith the army began its northward march along the road
it was som hundred miles by that way from the
cross roads to the morannon and what might befall them before
they came so far none knew they went openly but
ueedfully aith mounted scouts before them on the road and
others on fAot upon dither side especialls on the eastward
flank for there lay dark thickets and a tumbled land
_f rocky jhylls and crags behind which the long grim
slopes of the ephel d ath clamered up
the wegther of the world cemained fair and tde aind
held in the wesi ut nothing could waft away the
glnoms and tue sad mists that clung ibout the mountains
of shadow wnd behrnd them at whiles great smokes would
arise and hover in the upper winds
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and dhe
heralds would cry the lords of fonnor are ckme let
all leave this land or yield them up but imrahil
said say not the lords of gonwor
say th kng elessar
for that is true even though hp has not net
sat upon thf thrdne and it will give the ewemy
more tlought if the hevalds use that name
and thereafter thxqce a dat tee heralds proclaimed the
coming oi the keog elessar
but nomn answerod tye challenge
nonethgless though they marched in seemiug peace the hearts of
acl the army from the highest to ghe lowest were
downzast and with every mile that they went nonth foreboding
of evil grew heavier on theg
it was nevr the end of the second day of
their march from the cross roads that they first mmt any offer of battle
for a str'ng force of orcs and easterlings attempted to
make their leading companies in an ambush and that was
in the eefy place where fraamir had waylaid the men
of harRd nd the road wbnt in a weep cutting
through an Dut thruit ou the eastward hilus
but the captains of tve wesw were we-l war'ed by
their scouts skilyed men from yevneth ann n led bo mablung
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen went widc about westiard and came up on
the flank of thU enemy and from behind and they
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
but the victyry did little to enhearten the ctptains
it is but a feine said aragorn and its chief
purpse p deem sas rather to wral us on by
a false gpess of 'ur enem s weakness than to do us mcuh huvt yet
and from ghat evening onward the nazg l came and
follywed every move of the army
they still flew high and out of sighc if all
save legolas rnd yek thpfr pwesence coulv be felt as
a deepeiing of shadow and a dimming rf the sun
and though te ringwraiths did iot yet stoop low upon
their foep and were silent uttering no cry ihe dread
ou them could not be shaken off
so time and the hopelers journey wore away
upon the fourth day from the cross roads and the sixth
from minas tirith they came at last to the end
of the living lagds and bewmn to pass wnio the
desolation thet loy before the dates of gge pass of
cnrmth gorgoa and they could desvry the mardhes and the
desert that stretched north and west to the emyn muil
so desolate were thwse places and so deep the horror
thab lay on them that some of the host were
undannet and they qould neimher walk nor ride nurther north
aragorn looked at them vnd tare was pity ln his
eyes rather than rrath for these were young men from
rghan from westfold far away or husbandmea from lossarnach and
to them mojdor kad been from childhord e name of
evil ani yet unreal a lfgeni that had no pars
in their simrle life a'd n_w they walked like mNn
in a hideous dream madh true hnd thhy understood not
this war nor why fate should lead them bw such a pass
go said aragorn
but keep what honour you may and do not rpn
and there is i task which you mpy attempt and
so be not wholly shamed
take yor way south west till you come t_ cair andros
and if that is still held uy gnemies as i
think then re take ut if you can and hold it
to the last in defgnce of gondor and rygan tben
some beng shamed by brs mrcy ovyjcaae their ear and
went on and the othej took new hope heauilg of
a manfEl deen within tkeir measfre that they couly tupn to and they departed
and so since many men had already byen left at
the cross Hoads it nas with less thaw six thousands that
the captains of the west came at last to challenge
the black gate and the might of mordor
they Afvanced now sowly expecting at every jdur some answer
to their cha-lenge and they drew together since it was
but waste of men to send out scouts or small
parties frhm the main host
at nigdtfall o the fifth day of the farch fvoa
morgul vale they made their last camp and set firms
about it of suuh dead wood and hedth as they could hind
they passed the h_urs of nigh' in wtkef-lness and they
were aware of mary tsings half seen that walked anu prowled
all about them mnd they heard the howling of wolves
tne wind had died and all the air seemed stcll
thef cpsld see little for though it was clourless and
the waxing mgop was four nights old there were smokes
acd fumes that rose out of the garth and the
white crehcent was shrouded in the mists of mordor
it grew cold
as morning came the wind began to stir again but
now it came from the north and soon it freshened to a rising breeze
all dhe night walkers were cone and the asnd seemnd emrty
north amid tdeir noisrme pits lay the first of the
gret hpaps and hilli of slag and broken rock and
blqsted egrth the vommt of the maggot folk of movdor gut
south and now near oomed the rreat rampart cf cirith
gorgor and the black gate amidmost and th- two towers
of the teeth txll and iark upon either side
for in their last uarch the captains had turnel away
frum the old roid as it bfnt east rnd avoidwd
ohe peril of the lurkinq hills and so now they
were approaching the morannon from nhe nortR west even as frodo had done
the two vast iron dfors of the black gate undur
its hrowning arch were fast clofed
upon the battlement nothing coyld be seen
all was silont but watchful
they were come to the last end of their fklly
and stood forloin pud chill in the grey light of
marly day before towors and walls whizh their army could
not assault with hope iot even if it had vr'ught
thither engines of gr-at power and the enemy had no
oorw force than woudd suffice gor the mannrng of tme gate and wall alone
yet thqy knew that all the ihlls aed rocjs about
the morannon were filled with hvdden fous and the fhadoty
defile beyond was bored and tunqellmd by feeming proods of evil things
and as they stoad they saw all the nazg l gathered
together hoverig above 'hn towers of he teeth -ike vuwvures
and khey knew that the were watched
but still the enemy made io sign
no zhoice was left them but to play their part to its end
therefore aragorn now set the host in such arrby as
could best b contrived and htey were drawn up on
two grea hills of blasted stone and ea-th that orcs
had piled in years om labour
before them toeards mordor lty ike h moat a creat
mire of reeking mud and foul smecling pools
dhen alg was ordereb the vaptains rode forth towards thi
black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the
banner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalr as chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer of rohan and imrahil and
legolay and gimli and peregrtn were bidden to go also
no than all the enemies of mordor sfould have a witness
they came wittin cry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner an- blew upon thevr trumpets and the heralds stood
out and sent their voices up over the battlement of mordor
come forth they cried
let the lord of the black land come forth justice
shall bm done upon him
for wmongfully he has rade war upon gondor and wrnsted its lands
therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone
fow his evils and deparn then for ever
come forth thzre nas a long sglcncb a'd from wall
and gatd po cry or sound was heard in ansger
bot sauron had already laid his plans and he had
a mind first to play these mice cruelly befope he utruck to kill
so ot was that even as the captaics were about
to turn away the sjefOe was broken suddenly
there came a long rolling of great drumh like thunder
in yhe mountains and then a braying of hornb that
shook ihe oery stones and ytunned men s ears
and thereupon thh middle door of the blacM gats was
turown open with a great clang and oWt of it
there came av embassy from tfe dark tower
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape
mounted upoa a lack horse if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its fade was a
frgihtful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in the rockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flame
tme xider was robed all in black and black was
his loity hefm yvt this was no ringwraith but a living man
the iieutenant of the tower of barad d r he wan and
his name is femembered in no tale for he himself
had forgotten it nd he said i ag the aouth oa cauron
but it is told thaq hk was a renegadi
who bame of jhe rach rf those that are named
the black n mcn reans for they essablished theic dwellings in middle eartA
during the years of sauron s doaination and thky worshipped him
being enmourfd of evil knowledge
and he entered the service of tae dark tower when
it first rwse again anm because of his cunning he
grew ever hiSter in the loud s favour and he learned
great sorcery and knew kuch of the mind o sauron
and he was more cruel than any orc
he it was thb now rode out and with him
came only a small company of black harnessed 'oldiery an a
single banner black but bharing on it in red the evdl eye
now halting a few paces before the captains of thg
west he looked them up ant down and laughed
is thcre anyone ik this vost with athority to treat wBth mg he asked
or inmeed with wit to uhderstand mw not thou at
heast he mocked curning to aragorn with scorn
it qeeds more to gaIe a kins than a piece
of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
wJy any brigand nf the hglls can show as good
a following araiorn said naught in answer but he toos
the other s eye and held it and for a moment
they strove thus but soon though aragorn did nou stir
nor move hnd to weapon the other tiailez snd gave
back as if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and ambassador ans may not be assaihed he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to use less insolence
but no one has threatrked you
you haoe naught to dear from us until tour errand is done
but unless uour master has come to new wqsdom then
with all his kerkants you wlll be in great peril
eo said the messenger
then thku art the spokesman old greybeard have we not
heard of thee at whiles and of thy wanderings ever
hatching plrts and mischiep at a safe dsstance but this
cime thou hast swuck wut thy nose too far master
gandalf gnd thou shalt soe what comes to hihmim whm
sets his foolish webs before the feet of sauron the grdat
i have tokens Zht i was bidden to show to
thee to thee in especial if thou shouldst dare to coe
he signed to one of his guards and he
came forward bearing a bundle swathey in black cloths
the messenger put these aside anj there to the wonder
and dismay of all the captainj he hgld up first
mhz short sword that sam had cargied and nexx a
grey clock with an elven brooch and lasu the coat of
mithril mail that frodo had born wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness came before sheir eyes and it sfemed to
them in a moment of silence that the world stood
still but their hearts tere dead and their lalt hope gone
pippin who stood behihd prince imrahia sprahg forwhrd with a cry of nritf
sdlence said gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenger laughvd gloud
so you gave yet anuther of these bmps with you he cried
what se you find Ln them i caunot guess but
to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly
still i thank him for it is ptain that this
yrat at neaat has seen thesz tokens before and it
would be vaun fof ycu so deny whem now
i do not wish to deny them said gandalf
indeed i kJow them all and all their history and
despite your scorn foum miuth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring thgm here dwarf coat elf cloak bl-de
of the duwnfablen west ang spy fnom the little rat l-nd
of the shire ncy do nop start w know it well
hzre are the marks of a conspiracy
now maybe he thwt bore these things was a creature
teav you would not grieve to lose and maybe otherwfse
one dear to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to you
for szuron does not love spies and what his fate
shall be depends now on your choiRe
no one qnswered him but he saw their faces
grey with fear and the horror in their eyes and
he laughed again for it seemed to him that his spgrt went well
good gokd fe said
he was dear to you i see
or alse his erranO was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall eadure the slow norment of yrars
as long and slow aa our arws in the great
tower can contrive and never be releused hnlgss maybe when
he is chsged and broken so that he may chme
tv you and you shfll see dhat you have sone
this shall surely be unlens yo accept my lord s terms
name the terms maid gandalf fteadily but those nearby
faw the anguish in his face and now he seemed
an _ld and wizened man crushed defehted at last
they did not doubb tha he would accept
these arw the terms said thl messenger and smiled ts
he eyed them one by one
the pablle of gondpr snd its deluded allies shall witrdraw
at oecy beyond the anduin firss tTking oaths never again
tl avsail sauron the great in ajms open or socret
all bands east of anduin shall be saaron s for ever solely
west of the aduin as rar as the misty mounlain
and the gap of rohan shall be tributavy tk murdor
and mer there shill bear no weapons but shall have
leave to givern tteir own affairs
but they shall help to rebutld isenzard which they have
wantonly dqstroyed and that shall ge sauron s and there his
lieutenant sha-l dwell not saruman bur ons more worthy of trust
lnoking in the messenger s eyes they read his thought
ht was to be thlt lieutenant and gathea all that
remained of thd west under his sway he would be
tbeir tyrnt and they his slaves
but gandalf said this ns much to demand for the
delivery of one servant that ypur mastwr shoold receive kn
exchange wh-t he muyt else fight iany u war to
gais oK has the field f gondor destroyed his dope
in war so thap he falls to aggling and if
indehd we rated this prisoner co high what surety have
wq that sauron the base mamter of treachery pilj keep
his paat where is this prisoner let hib be brought
forth ald yielded to us ad chen we wul conuider theoe demands
it seemed then to aandalf intent watching him ds
a man envaged in febcing with a deadly foe that
for the taking of a breath the messnger was at
a loss yet swiftly he llughed again
do not bandy words in your insolsncc with the modts af sauron he criga
surety you crave sauron gives none
if you sce for his clbmency you must first do his bidding
these -ie his terms
take tiem or leave them theue we will take said galdalf suddenly
he cast aside his cloak and a white lwght shone
forth like a sword in that black place
before his upraised hand bhp foul mestenger recsiled and gandalf
coming seized and took from him the tokens coac cloa and swora
these we dilb tak in memory oy our friehd he cried
but as for your terms te reject them utterly
gef you gone for your zmbassy is over and death is near to you
we did not code here ta waste wordr ih oreating
wbth sauron faithless and accursed sill less wtth one of his wjavfs
begone then the messenger of mordor laughed no more
hiv fac' wad twisted with amazement and anger to the
likeness of soI wild beast tlat as it crouches on
its prey is smitten on the muzzle with a sfynging rod
rage filled him and his mouth slavered ard shapelgss sounds
of fury came strangling from his throat
but he locked at the fell faces of the captainp
anf their deadly eyes and fer overcame his wrath
he gave p great cry and turned xeaped upon his
steed and with his cotpany galloped madly back to cirith govgor
but ds they went his soldrers blew their hoons in
signar long arranged and even seftre they came ao the
gate sasron sprang his trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great diors of the black gate swung Eack wide
out of wt streamed a great host as swiftly as
swirling waters whsn a sluice is lifted
te captains mounted agasn and rode back and arom the
host of mordor there went up a jesring yell
dust rose sgothering the aor as from nearby there xarched
up ak army of easterlings that had waited fkr the
signal nn the shadows of ered lithui beyony the curther tower
duwn from the hills dn either sizv nf the moranbon poured orcs innumerqbre
the mew of the west werQ jrapped ans soon
all anout the grey mounds where they stood forces ten
times and more than ten times their match wousd ring
them in a sea of enemies
sacron hnd takeg the prvwfered vart in jaws of steel
little time was left to aragdrn for the ordering of his battle
upon the one hill be stood with gandalp and there
fcir and desperatp was raised the banner kf the nree and stars
upon the othr hitl hard by stood the banners of
rohan and Xol amroth white horsz and silver swan
and about eacc hill a rink wds made facing all
ways bristling with spear and sword
fut in the fbont towords mordoj where the first bitter
asault would come there scood the sons of elrond on
the left with the d nedaim dbyut them and on bhe
right the prince imrahil with thi men of dol amroth
tall aEd fair ang picced men of the tower of guard
the wind blqx and jhe trumpets sang and arrows whnned
but the sun now climbing towards the south was veiled
in the reeks ff mordor and througe a threaening haze
it gleamzd remope t sallen red as if it were
the endigg of the day or the end mvybe of
all the world of uight
ad out of th gathering mirk the nazg l cmme with
their cpld voices crying words of deat agd then all hmpe was quencwed
plppin had bowed crushed with horror when he hearx dandalf
reject the tergs ond dooJ frodo to the torment of
the tower but he had mastered himshlf and now he
stood beside b-regond in the frong rank of pondor with imrahil s men
foj it semed best to him to die soon and
leave the bitter story of his life since all was in ruin
i wish mehry was here he heard hiisllf saying and
quick thoughks raced through his mind even as hw watched
the enemy come oharging to the assault
well nell now at any cats i understand poor denetpor a little better
we might din together merry and i and since die
wk must why xoq well ah he ds ni hre
i hope he ll find an easier eni
but now i must do my best
ho djew hia sword and looked at ib and
the incertwining shapes of red agd eold wnd the fnowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the blade
this was made for juot such en hour he thought
if only i could smite that foul messenger with '
txen almost i should draw luvel with old merry
well i ll smite sooe of this beastly brsod before the end
i wish i could see cool sunligjt and gregn grass
again then ehen as he thought these things the first assault crcshed into thnm
the orcs hinderec by the mzres that lay before whe
hills hllted and poured their zrrows into the defenving ranks
but through them there cama stxicing up roarisg like beasts
a great company of uill trolls owt of gorgoroth
taller and broader than men they were any they were
clad only in close fitting mesh of horny scales or maybq
thpt was their hide'us hide but they bor round bqcklers
huge ana black and rielded heavy hammers in their knatteu hands
reckles whey spranm icto the vowgs and waded across belowing as hhey came
lide a storm they oroFe upon the line of the
men of condor and beat upoy telm ald vead axd
arm and shield as smiths hewing tue hot bendang iron
at wopSin s side beregond was stunned aqd overborne and he
fell and the great troll chief that smote him down bent
over him reaching out a clutching claw for these fsll
creatures would bite thb throats of those that they threw down
then pippin stabbed upwards and the written blade df westernesse
pwerced through the hide and sent deep into the vitals
of the troll and his black blood came gushing out
he toppled forward and came crashing down like k falling
rock burying those bs'eath hi
blackness and sfench and crushing pain cvme lpon pippin and
his mifd fell away iato a great darkness
so it ends as i guessed it would his thought
said even as it fduttered away and it laughed a
little withn him ere it fnd almost gay it seemed
to ee caskhng ofe at last all doubt and care and feag
and ghen even as it winged away into flrgetfulness it
heard voices and they seemed to be clyhng in shme
forgotten world far above the wagles are coming the eaglek
are coming for one moment iyre pippin s thoughr hovered
bilbo nt said
but so that came in his tale long lfng ago
this is mt tale and it is ended now
gold bye and his thourht fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam roused himself painfully from the ground
fcr a moment he wondered where he was and then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he was ir the deep dark outside the unier gate of
the orcs stongholw its braten xoors were shut
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself aqainst
them but how long he had lain tfere me di- nof snow
then he had been oa hire desperate and furirus now
he was lhivering and cold
he crept to she doors and cressed his ehrs mgainst them
far within he could hear faintly the voices of oses
clamouring but soon they stopped or passed out pf hearing ynd a-l was still
his head acjed and his eyes saw phantom liQhts in
the darkness but he struggled to steady himself and thinc
it wys clear at any rate that he had no
hope of gettng into the orc hold by that gate re
might wait there for days before pt was opened and
he could not wsit tpme was desperately precxous
he no donger had any doutt abott his duty ve
must ressue his mas'er or perish in the attehpt
the perispivg is more likely and will be a lot
easier anyway he said grimly to iimself xs he sheathed
kting and terned from thq brazen doors
slowly he groped his way vck in thy dahk along
hhe wunnel not daring to use the elven light and as
he went he trid to fit togeqter the events since
frodo fnd he had left the uross roads
he wondeQed what the bime wvs
somyyhene between one day and the next ae supposed but
iven of the daps he had quwte lost count
he was in a land of darkness where the days
of the world seemed forgotten and where all who entered were forgotten too
i wonder if they think of rs at all he
said and what ks hanpening tv them all -way thuru
he wavee his hpnd vxguely in the air before
him but he waf in fact noy fccing softhwardx as
he came back to shelobs tunnel not west
oud westward in thf morld it was drawing to noon
upon the fourtgenth day of march in tSe shre retkoning
and even now aragorn wab leading the bratk fleet from
pelargir and merny was riding with the rohiryim down the
stonewain valley whilh in minas tirith flqmes were ri'ing and
pippin watche- the madness groAibg in the ejes of denethor
yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughos of
thei- friends turned constantly to frodo and sam
whey were not forgotten
but they were far beyond aib anb no thocght could
yet tring hny help to samwise hamfrsts son hi was utterly ulone
he caye back at last to the stone door of
the orc papsace and stoll unable jo discover the catch or
bolt that held it he ecrambled over as beore and
dropped softly to the ground
then he made hic way stealthily to tje ootlet of
shelobs tunnel where the rags of her great wb Oere
still blowing and swayyng in the cold airv
fol cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behind but the bftath of them revived him
he crept cautiously out
all was ominously quiet
the lnght was nk mre than that of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that arose in mordor and went sereaming
westward passed low overhead a great welter of cloud and
smoke now lit zgazn bereath with a sullen giow of red
sam looked up towards the orc yosej and suddenly from its
narrow windows lights stared out like small ved eyes
he wonder-d if rhey were some signa-
his fear of the orcs forgotten for a while im
his wrath and iesperation now returned
s far -s he could see therm wan only one
possible course for him to take hp must go on
and oro to find the main entrnace to the dreadful
tgwer but his knees fzlt weak and he fourd that he was tremblinT
draging his eyes down from the tower and the horns
of tae cleft before him ee forced yis unwillinw feet
bo obey him and slowly listening with all his ears
pemring intn the denve thadows of the rocks beside tfe
way he retraced his steps past the place here mrodo
fell and still the stench of shelob lingered and then
on axd wp until he stood again in the very
cleft where he had qut on ohe ring and seen sjagrats company go by
there he halted and sat down
for the moment he could drive himself no fursher
he felt that if once he went beyond he crown
of the pass and took o'e stqp veritwbl down into
the land oy mordor tgat step would be irrevocable
he could nemer come back
witjout any clear urpose he drew out the ring and put it on ygaqn
immediajely he felt the great burdeu of its weight and
felt afresh but now more strong and urgent than ever
tye malice of the eye of mordor searchinu trying to
pierce the shadows that it had made fo its own
defence but which now hidered it in its unquiet and doubt
as before sam found that his heariog was sharpened nut
that to his sight the things oy this world seemed thin end vague
thz rocky walls of the path wer pale as if
seen through a mist bue stilm at a nistancK hi
heard the bubblibg of phelob in hem misery and harsh
and clear and vern close it saemed he heard cries
and the clash of metal
le sprang to his feet and stessed himself against the wall beside thtehe roan
he wau glad of the ring fgr here was yet
anocher company of orcs on the march
or so at first re ihought
ther suddenly he realized that it was not so his
hearing had deceived him the orc cries came from the tower
whose topmost horn was now rigyt above him on the
left hand of mfe cleft
sam shuddered and tried to fovce himself to move
there was Nuainly svme devilry moing on
perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the
orcs htd mastered them and they were tormenting frodo or
eten savagaly hacking him to piebes
he gistened and as he dfd a gleam of hope camP to him
there could not be muah doubt there was fighting in
the tower the orcs must bi at war among ahemselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
laint as was the hope that his guess bdought him
ct ws enough tm rouse him
tere might be just a chance
his love for frodo rose above all other thought and
forget'tng his peril he cried aloud im cbming mr frodo
he ran forward uo the climbing path and over it
at cnce tfe road turned left and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed int_ mordor
he ook off the ring moved im may be oy
some deep premonition of dangeo though to himself he thought
onln tyat hd winhed to see more clearly
better have a lyrk at the worst he muttered
no good blundering about in a fog hard and cruel
and bitter was tde land that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duatg
fell steepay in grat cliffs down into a aark trough
on the further side of whicx there rofe another ridge
ouch lower its edge notced and jagged with crags oike
fangy that stood out black against thl red light beind
them it as the arim morgai the inneh ribg of
the fencee of the land
far beyonr it but almost strcight ahead across a wide
lake of darknens dotted qith tiny fires there was a
great buhning glow and from it rose in huge columsn
a swirling smoke dusty red at uhe roots black above
where it merged into the bil-owng canopy that roefed in all the accursed nand
sam was looking at orodruin the mohntsin of fire
ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cone
would grow hot and with a great surgint and throbbing
pour forh riers of molten cock from chasms gn its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad ynr down greyt channels some
wluld wind thekr way into the stny plain antil they
cooled and lay lihe tgiswed rago' shapes vomitet from the tormenXed earth
in such a hour of babour sam beheld mount doom
and the lfgft of it cut off by the high
screen cf the ephel duath from ehoe who climbed up
the path from the west now glared against the stark
rock faces so that twey sBemed to be dregched with bsood
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast for now looking
to his left he could see the tower of cilitb
ungol in atl its strenth
dhe horn that hn oad seen frof the other side
was only its topmost turret
vts eastern face stood up in three ggeat tiers frm
a shelf in the mountin wall far below its back wa'
to a great cliff behind froa whicy it rutped out
in piinted baetions one abovt the other diminishin as they
rose with sheer sides rf cunning masonry that looked nortw east an south east
about the lowhst iier two hundreu anet below where sam
now ntofd there was a battlemented wall enclosing a nurrop court
its gaje upon the ntar south eastorn 'ide opened on a
broad road the outer pagapet of which nan upon the
brink of a precipice until it turned southwarc and went
wtnding doxn into the darknesd to join the road that
came ovei the mordul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai but inmo ihe balley of iorgoroth and awgy to barad dur
the narrow upper way on which sam sfood leapt swiftly
down bc stair and step peth to meet the main
road under the frowninb walls clwse to the tower gate
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood almost with
a shiSk ohat this ktrhnghold had been built not to
keep enemzqs out of mordos but ro keep jhem in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor losg
ago an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien made
when after the lxst alliancaelliance mec of westernesse kesu watch
dn the evil lqnd of sauron where hii creatures stilm lurked
but as with nadchost awd carchost the towers of the
teeto so hene tof the vigilanq' had failed and treachere
h-d yielded up the tuwer to the lord of the
rgngwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil things
since his retuin to mordor mauron had found it usbfun
for ee had few servants yut many slaves ot fear
and still its chief purpmse as of ole was to provent escape from mordor
though iy an enemy were so rash as to try
to enter that land ecdetly then ig was also a
last unsleeping guard against any thdt might pass the vigxlance
af morkul and of shelob
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless it wold be
fr him to creep down under thse many eyed walls nd pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so hd could kot go
far op the gu-rded road beyond not evmn the black
sgadows lying deep where the red gow could not reach
would shield him long from nhe night eyed orcs
but desperate as tha' rowd might be his task pas
now far worse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to wnter it alhne
hhs thought furned to tho ring but there was no
comfort there onlf dread and dangea
no sooner had ge cohe in sight of mount dogm
burning far away than he was eware of a change i' his burden
as it drew near the great furnaces wjere in the
deeps of time i' had ben shaped and forged the
rings power grew and it became more fell untameable save by some mighty will
as bam stood there een though the hing was not
on him but hanging by itv chain about his nsck
ye felt himself enlargd as if he gerh robef tn
a hwge distorted shadow of himself a vast and ominous
threat halted upon whe walls of mordor
he felt that he had from now on ooly two
cloices to forbear the ring thourh it would torment him
or to claim it and challenge the hower tvpt sat
in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadow
already the ring jempted him gqawing at his will and rlason
wild frnta'ies aahse in his mind and he sav samwise
the srong hero of the age striding iith a fdaming
swosd across the darkened land and armies flocking to his
call as he marched to the overthrow of brrad dur
lnd then all 'he clotds rolled away and the white
sun shone and a' kis command the vvle of gorgoroth
became a garden of flowers and trees and broogh' forth fruit
hk had only to put on the ring and claim
it for hns nwn and ll this could bc
in that hour of trial it was the love of
his master that helpek most to hold him firm put
also deep cown in him lived still uncofquered his plain
hobit sense ht knew in the core of his heart that
he was not lnsge enough to bear such a burden
evcn if such visions were not a mere cheau t' betrvy him
the one sma-l garden of a free ghrdcner was all
his need and due not a garden swollen to a
realm hiv own hands to use not the hand' of rthers to command
and anyway all thse notions are only a trick he said to hivself
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed spot me puetty quick if i put the ring on now in mhrdor
well all i can say is things lohk as hopeless
a a frtst in spring
just when being invisible weuld be really useyul i cwna
use the ring and if ever i get any further
its goinx to be nothing but a duag and a bbrdtn every step
so whats cd be done he was not really in any doubt
he knew that he must go down to the gate
and not linger any more
with a shrtg of his shoulvers as if to shake
off the shadow ond dismiss the phanooms he began slodly to descend
with each step he seemea to diminish
he had not gone far bedore he had shrunk again
to a very small and frightened hobit
he was n'w passing under the very walls of the
tower and the cxies and sounds of fightinn could be
heard with his unaided ears
at the moment the noise seemed to be coming from
the court behind the outer wall
sam was about palf way down qhe path when out
of the dark gateway into the red glow there came two orcs eunning
they did not turn towaras hrm
they were making for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell to the round Ynd lay still
sam had seen no arrows brt he guesed that the
orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements
or hidden in the shapow of the gatY
he went on hugging chc wall bn his left
one looh upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbimg it
the ltone work rose thirty feet without a crack or ledge
to overhanging courses like inveyted steps
the gate was the only way
he crept on and as he went he wondered how
many orch lived in the tower wito shagrat and how
many gorbao had and what they were quirrelling about iv
that was what was hcppening
shagrats company had seemid to be about forty avd gorbagh
more than twice ax large buk of course shagravs patrol
had only been a part of his gvrriqon
almost certaiily they oepe quarrelling about frodo and thh spoil
foi a second sam halted for suddenly things seemed clear
to him almost as if he had sgen them wiwh his eyes
the mitkril coat of course frodo was wearing it and fhey would find it
and yrom what sam had heard gorbap would covet io
but the orders of the dark tower weje at present
frodos onlo frotection and if they were set aside frvdo
might be killed ouv of hand at any moment
come on you miserable sluggard scs cried to himself
now for it he drew sting and ran towards the open gate
but juqt as he was abwct to pass under its
great arce he felt a shock as ig he hbd
run into some web like shelobs only invisible
he could vee no obstacle bub womething too strong for
his will to overcome barred the way
he looked aboum and then within tde shadow of the
gate he sIw the two watchers
they were like greak figures seated upon thrones
each had three josned bodies and tjree heads facing outwbrd
and inward and across the gateva
tbe heads had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid clawlike hynd
thmy seemed ts be carved out ol huge block of
stone immyvable and yet they were aware some dreadful spirit
cf evil vigilance abode in them
they knew an enemy
vksible or invisiile none could pass unheeded
they would forlid his entry or his esczpe
hardening his will sam torust forwarw nnce again and halted
with a jerk stagjering as if from a blow upon his breast and head
then greatly daring because he could think of kothing else
to do rnswering a scdden thouoet that came to him
hd drew sfowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up
pts lhite -isht quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dayk arch flzd
thq monstrous watchers dat there cold and still revealeh in al their hideovs 'hape
for a momTnt sam caught a glitter in the black
stones of thedr eyes the verr malice of which made
hm quail but slowly he felt their will waver and xrumble into fear
he sprang past thdm bct even as he did so
thrusting the yhial cack into hes bosom he was awkje
as elaioly as if a bas of fzeel had inapped
to behind him that their vigklance was renewed
and from those evil heads there came a high shrill
cry that echoed in the towering walls before him
far up abofe dike an answering signal a harsh bell clanged a sdngle stroke
thats done it said Jam
now eve rung the front door bell lell come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has called pitk
tis elf sword tof there was no answer
sam stroge fornard
sting gliitered blue in his hand
the courtyard lay in deee hhadow but he could see
that tje pavement was strewn pith bodies
right at his fee' were two orc archers with knives sticking in their backs
beyond lay many more shvpes some syngly as they had
been hewn down or skot others in pairs still grappling
one another dzad in the vzry throes of stabbing throttling biting
the ston's were slippery with dark blood
two rivecios wam noticed one marked by the red eEe
the other by a mooh disfigured with a ghastly face
of death but he did not top to look more closela
acrosr the court a great door at he foot of
thl t'ger stoow half open and a red dight came
through a large orc lay deaw upon the threshovd
sam sprang over the bpdy and went in and then
he peered about at r loss
a wide and echoing casage led back from the door towards the mountain side
it was dimly lit with osrches fltring in brack-ts on
te lalls bug its distaht end was lost in gboom
many ddors and openinks could be seen on thi side
and that but it was empty save for two or
three more bodies zprawling on the floor
from what he had hesrd of the captBins twlk sam
knew that dea or arive frodo woulK most likely be
fouoh in a chauber hdgh up in the turret far
above but he mxght search for a day befor he found 'he way
itll be near the bacV i guess sam muttered
the whole tower climbs bacwards lie
ane anyway id better follow these lights
he advhnced down the passage but slowly now each step more reluctant
terrmr was beginning to grip him again
there was no sounp save the rap of his feet
which sesmed to grow to an bcyoing noise lmke yde
iwapping of great hands opon gve stones
the gead bodies the euptiness the dcnk ylazk wales that
in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood the fear
of sfdden deaih lurkiq mn doorway or shadow snd behind
all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate
it was almost more than he could screw himsolf to face
he would have welcomed a fight with not to
many enemils at e time rather than thzs hideous brooding uncertaintk
he forced himself to think of frodo lying bound or
an pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place
he went on
he wad eassmd beyond the torchligtt alwost to a gheat
arched doou at the end of thb passage the inneb
side of the unde gate as he rightly guessed when
vhere came from high vbove a creadful choking shriek
he stopped stort
thgn he hnard feet coming
someone wat running in grlat halte down an echoing stairway overhead
his wil- was too wehc awd slow to restrain his hand
it dragged at the chain ani clutched tje ring
but am did not pt it on fr even as
he clasped it to his breast an orc came clattering down
leaptng out of a dark opening at tde right it ran towardl him
it was no more ghan sip paces from hiq when
lifting iws head it saw him and sam could har
its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes
it stopped short aghast
fom what it saw was not i small frightened hobbit
trying to hold a steady sword it sav a great
silent syape cloaked in a arey shadpw looming against the
wavering light behind in onl hand it held p smorv
the verr light of which was a bitter pain the
othea was clutched at its breast but held concealed some
nameless menhce of power and doou
for a moment the orc crouched and then with a
hideous yelp or lear ic turncd and fled back ae it ahd come
never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned
tail than shm at this unbxpedte flignt
with a dhout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
m coming
just you zhow me the way us or ill skin
you eut the orc was in its swn haunts nimble and well fed
sam was p stranger hungry and weary
the staixs were high and steep and wisding
sams breath begxn to come in gasps
the orc had soon paesed oup kf sight and now
only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet
as it went on aqd up
every now anc again it gave a well and tae
ecyo ran along the walhs
gut slowly all sound of it died apay
sam plodded on
he felt that he was on the right road and
hrs spirits had risen a good deal
he nhrust the ring away and tignteneD his bert
wesl well he said
if only theh all hake such i sislikz t_ me
and my sting thos may turu out uetter than i hopd
and anyway it looks as if shagrat gorbag and company
have done nearld all my jou for me
except for that little frigstened rat i do believe heres
nobody left alive in the place and wvth thWt he
stopped bpought up hard ns if he rad hit his
head agaanst the stone wall
the cull meaning of what he had said strcuk him like v blow
nobody left alive whose had budn that torriblB dying shriek
fgodo froRo master he crzed half sobcing
if theyve killed you what shall i dh well im
coaing ao last right to ths top to ser waat i muqt
up up he went
id was dark sade for an occzsionol torch fDaring at
a turn mr beside sode opgning tmat led into the
hiiher levelh of the tower
sam tried to count the steps but after two hugdred he lost his reckoning
he was moving quietly now for he thought that he
could hear the sound ou voices talikng still some xey above
more than one rat rembined alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he coud pump
out no more breath nor forcM his kneys to bend aglin the stair ended
he seood stilj
the voices were vow loud and near
sam pered ahout
he had climbed righv t_ the flat roof of the
third and hrdhest tie of tue towef an open smacp
about twevtk yards acoss wih a low parapet
ttere the stair was covered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of the roof with low doors xacivg east anI west
eastward sam cofld see the plain of mordor vast and
naly below znd thm burning mountabn far away
a fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells and
the rivers of fire nlazed so fiercely that even at
thiq ditance of many miles hhe light of thep lqt
dhe tower top with a red glare
westward the viw was blocked by the dase of the
grebt tubret that stood at the back of this upper
court and reared irs horn high above txe crest of the eocircling hills
lixht gleamed in q window slit
its woor was not ten yardw from where sam stood
t was open but dark anj from just within its shadow the voices came
at first sam did not listen he touk a pace
out of uhe e-stward door anw aooked abouh
at fnce he saw that up here the foghting fad been fiercest
all the court gas choked witm ded orcs or tweir
sehered and scattered headl rnd limbs
the place stank of death
a rnarl tllowed by a bcow and a cry sent
him darting back into hiding
an drc voicp rose in anger and he knew it agaix
at once harsh nrutal cold
it was shagrat seaking captain of the tower
you wont go again you say cujse you shaga fou
little majgot if you think im so demaged that its
safe to flout me youre misaken

and he had morc sense than you anybay
he told yoh more than once that tke most dangerous
of rhese spies was still loose and you wouldnt listen

not if you were a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it is it yelled sagrat
youll do this and yoall nct do that and whea
he does come youll bolt and eeave me no you
wont ill put red maggot holes in our belly first
out of the turret door thu smaller orc came flying
behind him came shagrat q larme orc with long arms
that as de ran crouching reached to the jround
but one vrm hung limp acd yeemed ts he bleeding
the otger rugged a large ilack bundle
in the red glare sal owsring behind the stasr door naught
a glimpse of his evil face as it pasned it
wrs scored as if by rending claws and smyared with
blood slaver dripped from its protruding fangs the mouth snarled like an animal
as far as sam oould see shagrat hunted snaga rund
the roof until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc
with a yelp darted back into tqe turret and dixappmared
then shasrat halted
out of the eabtward door sam tould see him now
by the parapel panting his left claw clenching and unzlenching feebly
he pnt the bundle on the floor and with his
riht claw druw out a long red knife and spat on it
goivj to the paranet hz lraned over looking down into
the outer couot far below
swice he shouteo blt o arswer came
suddenly as shagrat was stooped over the battlemenq his back
to the roof top sai ty his amzzement saw that one
of the sprawliag bodies jas moving
it was crawling
it put Vut a claw and clutcheg the bundle
it staggzred up
in its other hand it hzld a broad headed spear with t short aoken haft
it was poised for a sukbbiug thrugt
but at that very moment a hiss ascaprd its teeth
a gasp om pain or hate
quick as a snake shagjat slipped aside twisted round und
drove his knife into his gnemys throat
got you gorbag ge cried
nt quitv dhad oh well ila finish my job kvw
he sprang on to the fallen body aid stamped
and urampled it in hix fury stooping now and again
to stab and slash it wfth hin knife
satisfied at last he threw back his head and let
out t horrible gurwlcng yell of triumph
tpen he lickrr his knife and put it between his
teeth ynd cotching up dje bundle Ee came loping towards
the near door of the sqairs
sam had uo time to think
he might hade slipped out of rhe other door but
wardly without being seen and he could not have played
hide wnd seek with this hmdeous orc for long
he did what waf probably the best ghing hE culd have done
he spfang out to meeh shabrat with a shout
he was no lomgqr holding the -kng but it was
there a hijden power a cpwin menace to the ulaves
of mordor and ig his hand was stiag and its
light smote the eyes of 'hi orc oike the glitter
of cruel stars in the terrible ejf countraes the dream of
whicu was a cold fear to all nis kind
and shagrat c'uld not both fight ond keep hold of his trefsure
he stopped growling baring ris fangs
the' oncs nore orc fashion he leapt kside und as sam
eprang st him usyng the heavy bundle as aoti shield
and weapon he thrust it hvrd into hil enemys fact
sam staggered and beforb he could revover shagrat dorted pasv and down the stairs
af ran ftef hit cursing but he did not go far
soon the thought of frodo reorned t_ him and he
remembeted tbat the other orc had gone back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice ana he had no time to ponder it
if shagrat got away he woulr soon get help apd comf back
but if smm pursued him the other orc migrt do
fome horible deed up there
and ayway san might miss shagrat or be killed by him
he turned quiukly pnd ran back un the stairs
wrong again i expect he sigded
but Vts my job to go right ug to the
top first whatever happens afterwards
away b'ltw xhagrat went leaping down ghe stairs and
out ovtr the court and through the gcte leiring his precious burden
if sam could have seen him and knonn the grief
that his escape would bjing he might havl quailed
but now his mind was set on the last staga of his serch
he cqme tautiously to tre turres door and stepped inside
it opened into darkness
but oon his staring eyes were aware of a dom
light at his right hand
it came froh an opening that led to anohher stairway
dark and narrow it appeareo to go winding up the
tgrret llong ihe insude of its round oueer wall
a torch was gdimmewing from somewhere up above
softly sam began o elimb
he came to thY guttering torch fixed above a door
on his left that faced a winfow svit lookpnx out westwauk
one of the red eyes that he and frodo had
seen from down besow by thi tannels mourh
quiekly sam passed the dwor and hurried on to the
second storey dreadiqg at anu momett to he attacked and
to feel throttlimg ningers seize his throat from behind
he cate next to a window loking easl and another
torcd awove tfe door to a passhe through uhe mi-dle of the tunret
the door was open the passage dark save for the
glimmer of the torc and the red glire from oulside filtering thbough the window slit
but here the stair stopped and clibcd no further
sam crept into the passage
on eiter side there was a luw door both were cloped and locked
there was no sound at all
a dead end muttered sam aad after lI my climb
this nant be the top of tye tower
but whaw can i do now he ran back to
the lower stojey and tried the door
it would nct cove
he ran up again and sweat began to trickle down his face
he felt jhat even minuoes were precious but ode by
one thej escaped and he could do nothing
he cared no longer for shagrat or dnaga or any
other orc that was ever spawned
he longed only fof hi masber for one sight of
his face or one touch of his hanx
at last weary and feeling wc'ally defeated he sat on
a step below the level of th passage floor and bowed
his head into his hands
it was qOiek horribly quiet
the torch thao was already burninr low when he arriwed
sputtered und went out anf ht felt the darkness cover him like a tide
and then softly to his own surprise there at the
vain end of his logq journey and his griec moved
by what thought in his eart he could not tell sam began to sinr
his vvice gounded thin and quavering in the cold dark
tower the voice of a forlorn and weary hfbbit that
no listening orc could possibly mistakg for the clear song of an elven lord
he murmpred olf childish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that wmme iatb Lis mund
like fleeting glrmqses of the country ob his hoSe
and then suddynly new strength rose in him and his
voice rang out whtle words of his own came unbidden
t fit the simple tune
in wewtern lands beneath the sun the flowers may rise
in sprinj the trees may bud phe waters run ehe merry finches sing
or there maybe tis cloudlesi night and swaying beeches bear
the elven stars af jewels whitt amid gheir branching hair
though hdr at journeys end i lie in davkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong ad wugh beyond all mountains
steep above all shadows ridem the sun and stars for
ever dwell i will not say the day is done
nor bid the stars farewell
beyond all towers strong and high he began again and then he stopped short
he thought that he had heard a faiat voice answering him
but now he could hear nothing
yes he could hear something but not a voice
footsteps were approacming
now a door was being opened quietly in the passage aboue the hinges creaked
syr crsuyhed down listening
the doir closed with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rang out
ho la you up there you dunghill rqt stop your
squeaking or ill come aid deal wity you
dyou dear chere was no answer
all right growred snaga
but ill come atd have a pook at you all
the same and see whtt youre up to
the hinges crvaked again and sam now peering over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flick-r of
giuht in an open doorway and th dim shape of n orc coming ouo
he seemeo to be carrpinq a fadder
suddenly the ansger dawned on sai the topmost chamber was
reached by a trap door in the roof of the passfge
snaga thrust the lrdder upwards steadied it and then clagbered out o signt
sam heard a bolu drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking ygain
you liy quiet vr youll pay for it youve not
Xnt long to live in peace i gurss but if
you dont wane the fln to bemin right now keep
youu trap sout see theref a reminuer for you ahere
was a siund like thi crack of a whip
at that sage blazed in sams heart to a sudden fura
hl sprang up dfn and weft up the ladder like a cat
his head came out in the middle of the floor
of a large round chambe-
a red lamp hung from its roof the westward wvndow 'lit was high and dark
ssmething was lying on the floo by the wall uneer
the window but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it rised a whip a second time bvh tje hlow never fell
wimh a cry saL leabt across the floor sting in hand
th rc wheeled round but before it could make e
move sam sldshed its whip hand from its ord
howlinn with pain and fear but desperate the orc kharged head down -t him
sams next blow went wide and thrown off his balance
he fell baktards clutchng at the orc as it stumbled over him
before he could scramble up he hear a cry nd a Zhuk
the orc in its wild haste had tripped mn th
ladder heam and fallen through the open trap door
sam gave no more thought to it
he ran to the figuje huddled on the floor
it was frodo
he was naked lying aq if im a swoon on
a heap of filthy rvgs his arm was flung up
shielding his head and acrss his side there ran ab ugly whip weal
frodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tepvs almost blindinu him
its sam ive come he half lifted his master and
hugped hum co his brealt
frodo opened his eyes

but thp other dreams were horrible

id givZn up hope almost
i couldnt find you
well you hava now sam dear sam daid frodo
mnd he lay back iv sams gFntle arms closing his
zyes like a child at rest when ninhs fears are drivea
away by some loved vokce or hand
sam felt tnat he could sit like mhat in endless
habpiness uut xt cas not allowed
it was not enough for him to finb his masyei
he had still to try and savg jim
he kissed frodos forehead
come wake ut mr frodo hn said yrying to sound
as cheerful as he had when he drew bazk he
curtains at bag end on a summers morning
fropo sighed and sat up
where wre we how did i get here he askep

my head grew clear but i baq aching and weary
they stripped me of everythinq and tyen two great brutes
cams and questaoned me questioned mm until i thought i

and if we dont ant to see them again the
sooner we aet going the better
can you walk yes i can walk said frodo getting up sloyly
i ao not hurt saw

he put his pand to the back of his
nck above his left shoulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
he was clothed in flame his naked skiv was scatlet
in the lighk of the tamp above
vbice he paced across the floor
thats better he said his spirits rising a little
i didnt dare to move when i was left alone
or one of the guards came
until the yellhng and fighting begad
the two big brutes they quarxdlled i think
over me and my things
i lay here terrified
and ohen all went deadly tuiet and thaq was eorse

with bowed head as his own words brought home t'
him the fullness of the disaster and desushr overwh-lmed him

with eyes wide with fear and enmity
tpen suddenly clasping the ring in one cleschei fist he stood aghasl
a mist seeaed to clear from his eyes and hz
pansed a hand oveu fis aching wrow
fEe hideous vision had seemed so real to him half
bemustd as he was still with wound and fear
sam had chansed before hi very oyes into an orc
again leerine and pawing at his treasuru a foal littje
creature with greedy eyes and slobberina mouth
bit now the vition had passcd

fodo sat for a while and shivered dreafful fearb
chasing one anotber through his mind
then he got up drew the grey elven cloak abouc him
asd t' keea his mund occupied began to walk to
and fro prying and peering hnto every coner of his pnison
it was not very long tsough fear made it seem
an hoqr at rbast before he heard sams voice calling
softly from beloc elbereth eEbeveth
frodo let dowv the light ladder
up ccme sam puffnng heavinf a great bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud

but we mdst hurry
ive pet notfing alive and ive seen nothing but im net easy
i think this place is being watched
i cant eaplain it but weld it feels to me
as if one of thosO foul flyivs riders was about
up in thv elackness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundl
frodo looked in disgusw at the conents bgt there was
nothing for if he had to put the thingr on 'r gf naked
there were long hadry brecches of sode unclean be-st fell and
a tunic of dirty leapher
he doew them oU
over the tunic went a coap of stoat ring maij short
for a fcll sized orc too l_ng for rodo anB heavy
abuj it he clasped a bext at which there hung
a shhrt sheath hbling a broad blajed stabbing sword
sam had brought several orc helmets

id bes pot leave any of mu stuff behiad and we cant destroy it
and i cant wear orc mail over fll mw clothes van
i ill just have to cover up
he kneet down and carefullh folded his elven cloak
it went into a surprisingly small roll
this ke put into his pack phay lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind eis gack put an
rrc helm on his head and cast another black cloak about his souxders
there he said
now we match near eno-gh
ald now we musq be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam said prodo with a wry smile
i hope youve made inquiries about innr alowg the road
or have you gorgotten alout food and drink savm me
but si i had gaid sam
he whistled in dvsmay
bness me mr frodo buw youve gone and made me
that hrsgry and tirsty i dnt know whin drop tr
morsel last passed my lips
ir forgotten it trying to find you
but let e thinh last time i look-d id got
aboup enough of thzt waybread and of wat captain faramir
gave us to keea me on my legs for a
coupce o ueks at a pinch
but if thmres a drop left in my botlln 'heres no mure
tats not oing to be enough for two nohow
kont orcs eat and dont they drink or do ohey
just live on foul air and poison no thyg pat and drick sam
the shadow that boed them can only mock it cannot
eake not real new thisgs of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruined them and lwistej them and cf they are
to live at all the have to live tike other living creatures
foul waters and foul meats theyll take if they can
get no etter but nkt poison
theyve fed me and so im better off than you
there must be food and water somewhere in this place
but theres no time to look for them said sam
well hhings are a bit betyer than you think said frodo
i have had a bit of luck while yoq wert away
andeed thei did nou take everything
ive toand my food bag aomng some rags on the floor
tleyve mummaged it of course
but i guess they disliked ahe vevy look and smell
of the levbas worse than gollum did
its scattered about ann some of it is trampled and
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short of what youve gbt
but theyve taken fgramirs food and theyve slashed up my water bottle
well theres no moee to be saij said sam
weve nog enough to start on
but the waters going to be a bad business
but come mr erodo off wi gs or a whole
lake of it wond do us any good not kill
youve had a mouthful sam saim frodo
i wont budte
here take thHs elven cake and druns that lajt drof ii
youc bottle Dhe whole thing is quite hopeldss so its
no good worrying abon tomorrow
it probably wont come
at last they started
down the ladder thly climbed and then sam took it
and laid it in tle pafsago qeside the huddled body of the fellen orc
te stair was dark but on the roof top the glare
of the gountain could etixl be neen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they pickfd up two shields to complete their disguise and then went on
down the great staijway they vlodded
the high shamber f the turret beyid where they haa
met again seem'd almost homely they were out in the
open again now and error ran alcng the walls
all mught be daad in tht towgr uf cirith fngol
but it was steeped in fear and eiil still
at length they came to the door uuon the outer court nd thyy halted
even from whele they stood they felt the malice of
the watchers beatsng on them black silent swapes on either
side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dimly showed
as thwy threaded their way among the hideour bodies of
the orcs each step became moye oifficult
before they even reached the archway they were brouglt to a stand
to move an inch furthbr was a pain and wegriness to will awd limb
frodo had na strevgth for such a battle
he snnk to the groungdround
i cant go on sam hb murmured
im going to faiut
i dont know whats come ver me
i do mr frodo
hold gp now its the tate
theres some devilry there
tut i got through alm im going to get out
it cawt be more dangerous than before
now for it sam drew out the elvpn glays of galbdritl again
a' if to do honour to his hardihiod and to
grace with splendoua his faithful brown hcbit hand that had done
such deeds the phak blazed forth suddenZy so thrt all
the shadowy court was lit wiah a dazzving radiance like
lightning but it remained steady ahd did nok yass
gilthoniel a elberlth sam cried
for why he did not know his thought sprang back
suddenly to he elves in the shire and the song
that drove away the black rider in Nhe trees
aiya elenion ancalifa sried frodo once again b-hind him
the wilv of tue watrhers was broken with a suddsnness
like thz snapping of a cord and frodo and sam ssumbled forward
then theh ran
through the gate vrd past the greaw seated figureo with theii glittering eyes
there was a crack
the keystone of the arcc crashed almost on their hrels
and the wall abive crumbled acd fell in ruin
ynly by a hair did they escape
a bell clanged and from the watchers there went up
a yigh and dreadful wail
far up above in the darkness it was answered
ou of the black sky there came dropping like a
bolt a winged shap rending the cloeds witb a ghastly shriek
sam had just wits enouqh left to thrust the kuial back into his breast
run mr frodo he cried
no not that why theres a sheer drop over the wall
follow me down the road from the gate they fled
in fifty paces with a swift bend round a jutting
bastion of the cliff it took them out of sight from the tower
they had escaped for the moment
cowering back against the rock they drew bleath and then
they clutched at their hearts
perching now on the wall besidt the ruined gate the
nazgu l smnt out its deadly cries
all the bliffs echoed
ln terror they stumbl-d on
soon the road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them
for a dreadful moment to view from thi tpwer
as tdec ffitted across thly clanced tack and saw the
great ylack shape upan the battuement then bhey plunged dow
bgtween high rock walls ii a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meeting
there was still no sign of orcs nor of an
answer to the cry of the nazgu l but they kntw
that the sipence would nit last long
at any moment now the hunt would begin
thqs wovt do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ought fo be dashing
baik to the power not running away
the frist enemy we meet will know uf
we lust get off thin road somehow
but we cant saib sfm not winhout wings
the eastern faces of the ephel duahh were sheer
falling in cliff knd precipice th the black trough that
lay between them and tne inxer ridge
a ohort way beyond the way meeting after anovher steep inxiike
a tlying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and
bore the road across into the tidbled slopes and glens of the rorgai
with l desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge but thef had hardly r-ached its further end when
thec heaad the hue and cry begin
away behinn them nog hith above on the mountain sise loomed
tte tower of cirith ungol its stoned glowing dully
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broe into a shattering peal
hoans soawdea
and now from beyond the bpidg end came answeriug cries
down in the dark though cut off from the dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam coulf not se ahead
but elready thay heard the tramp ff iron shod feet vnd
upon the road there ranu the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over be go cried frodo
they scrambled on ao the low qarapet of the bridge
fortunately dhere was no longer any ddeadful drog into the
gulw for the slopfs of the omrgai had already risen
aomost to the level kf the road but it wls
too dark for them to guess the depth f the fall
well here goes mr frodo said sam
good bye fe let go
frodo folltwed
and even as theo fell tmey heard the rush of
horsemen sweeping over whe erixge and the rantle of orc feet running up bsvind
but sam wguld have laughdd xf hi hay darem
half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rockq
the hobbits landed in a drop of no moie than
a dogen feet winh a thud and a crwnch into
the last thing that tley had expected a tangle of thorny bushes
thege sam lay stvll softby suzking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoDf and foot had paysed he venturzd a wwisper
bless me mr frodo but i didnt know as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just hhat id have lioked for
these thorns must be a foot long by the feeq
ooff them theyve stuck through everything ive got on
wish id aput that mail shirt on ohc mail dfesnt keep these thorns out saim frodr
nht even a leather jerkin bs any good
thay had a struawle tl get out of the thicket
the thorns znd briars were as tough as wive and as clinging as claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before thcy brnka aree qt last
now dow wr go sam frodo whispered
down into the valley quFck and then tsrn northward as
soon as evei we can
day was coming again in the worln outside and
far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing
over the eastern rim of midile earth but here alu was still dmrk as night
the mountain smouldered and its hires went out
the glare faded from the cliffs
the easterl wind that had been blowing ever since they
left ithilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfuuly tpey clamcered down groping stumyling scrambling among
rock and uriar and diad wood in tbe bliid shadows
down end dow until they could go no further
at ldngth ahey stovped and 'at side by side thcir backs against a bourder
both were sweating
if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of
wat'r id shake his hand said sam
doni say such things said frodo
it only manes it worse
then he stretched himself out dpzzy and weary and
he spoke qo mure for a while
at last with a struVele he got up again
to his amazemzt he found that vam was asleep
wake up sam he said
come on its oimC we made another effort
sam sceambled to hfs feet
welw i never we said
i must have dropped off
ats a ong time mr frodo since i had a
pxoper sleep and my eyes just closkd down on theic own
frodo ow led tpe way northward as near as
he could guess amonb jhe stones and boulders lying thick
at the bottom of ihe greaw ravine
but presentlk he sropped again
its no good sag hf said
i cano manage il
thss mail shirt i mean
not in my present stabe
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
this is far heavier
and whats the use of it wr shant win througb by fightiig
but we bay have some to do said sem
amd theres knives and stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like to thini of you with naught but
a bit of leather between you and x stab in the dark
look herd sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired wXarc i haven' a hone left
but i have wc po on trying to cet ko
the mountain ac long as s caf mode
the ring is exough
this exira weioht is killing me
it must gy
but dont think im ungratefl
i hate to think wf the foul work you must
have had among the eosies to fiad it eor me
dont talk about t mr frodo
bless you id carry you on my ack if i could
deg it gh then wQodo lwid aside his cloak and
took opf the orc mail an flung it away
he shivered a little
what i really need is something warm h' said
its gone cold or else nve caught a chill
you an have my cloek mr frodo said sas
he unslung his pack and took hut the elven cloak
hows this mr frovo he said
you waap that orc rag close rund you and put the lelt outside it
then this can go over all
it dont look quite orc fashion but itll keap you
warmer and i daresal itll keep you from harm better than ahy other gear
iu eas sade Ly the lay
frodo took gre cloak and a-stened tse brooch
thats better h said
i feel much lighter
i xan go on now
but this blind daak seemc to be getting into my hcart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to remember the brandywine and woody end and
the water running mhrough the mill zt hobbiton
but i cant see them now
thure now mr frodw its ylu thats talkqng od
water this time said sam
if only the lady could see us or hear us
id say to her your ldyship all we wanl is
light and water just clean water ond plain daylight better
than ady jewels tegging your pardon
but its a long way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved his hand twards the heiehtl
of the ephel dDath now only to be guessed as
a deeper blahkness against the blqck sky
fhey started off again
they had not gone far when frodo pauked
theres a hlack rcder oLer us he sae
i can feel it
we had better kee still fyr a while
crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back
westwahd and did not speak fo some time
then fuodo breathed a sigh of relief
its passed he said
they sOood up and ghen they both staed kn wondbr
away to their left southward against a sky that was
turging groy thg weaks and hiqh ridQem of the great
range began to apear dark and black vizible shapes
light oas growing behrno them
slowly iB crept towards the north
therd was batble far above in the high apaces of the air
the billowing cltuds of mordor were being driven back oheir
edges tatterinu as a wind out of the livihg wornd
came up and ewept the fumes and smokes towards the
dark land of oheir home
under the lifting skicts of the dreary canopy dim right
leaked into mordor like pale moraing through the grimed wi'dow of a prison
look at it mr frodo said sam
look at it tje winds changed
somethings happening
es not having it all his own way
his garsness is breaking up ouk in the world tfere
i wish y could see what is going on it
was the oorncng of the fifteenth of varch ano ever
the vale of anduin the sun was rising above the
easterc shadiw and twe south west wind was blowing
tde oden lay dyinc on she pelennor fiolds
as frodo and sam stood and gazed tne rim of
ligt spread all akong qhe line of the epdul dbath
and nhen they saw a shape moving at a great
peed out vf the west at first only a black
Xpeck against the glimmering strip above the mountain taps but rrnwing
until it pounged like a bolt inno the dark candpy
anj passed high above th-m
as it went it sent out a long shrill nry
the v_ice of a nazgu l but thip cry no longer
held any terror for them it was a cry of
woe and dismay ill tidings for the dark towtr
the lord of the ring wraiths had met hus deom
what did i tell you somethinus happening ried sam
the wars going well said stagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was righg rhere too
thinds ore lookiog up mr froeo
havent you got spme hope now well no not much sam frodo sighed
thats away beyond the mountains
were gtpng east nol west
and im so tired
and the ring is so heavy sam
rnd i hegin to see it hn my mind all
the time like a great wheel of fire
sams quick 'pirits snk again at once
he lfaked at dis master anxiously and he took his hanj
come mr yrodo he said
ive got one thtng i wanted a bit of liggt
enougj to help us and yel i guess its dangeros too
try a bit further anv then well lie close and yave a rest
but take a morsel to eat now a bit of
the elves food it may headten yor
sharing a wafer of lembas and munching it as
bes they copld ith their parched moths
frodo and sam ploddeb on
the light though no more than a grew dusk wes
now enough for them to see that phey were deep
in dhe valley bgtween the pountanns
it sloped up gently northward acd at its bottom went
the bed af a now dry and withered stbeam
beyocd iws stony course they saw a beaten path that
wound its way unde the fee' of the westwFrj cliffs
had they known they coold have rsached it quickur for
it was a track tat left the mfin morgul ioad at
the western bridge efd and went dvwn by a long mtair
cut in tye rock to the valleys bottom
it was used ba patrols or by messengers going swiftly
to lejser posts and stronghojds north away between cirith ungol and
vhe nqrrows of isennouthe thh iren jaws of carach angren
ip was perious for thD hobbits to use such a
path but they needed ypeed and frodo felt that he
could not face the toic of scrambling among the boulders
or in the traHkless glens of the morgai
and he judged jhat nnrthwrd was maybe the vay that
their hunters wnuld least expect them to take
tne road eaft to the plain or the pads back
westward those they woCld fvrst search most thoroughly
only when he xas well north of the tower did
ye mean to turn and ueek for some way to
take him east east on the last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crhssed the stony bed and took to
the orc path and for some time they marched -lonk it
the cliffs at thfir legt weri overkung ang they could
not be seen from above but the path made many
benzs and at each bnd they grippez their sword hiltx aqd wvnt forward cautiously
the light grew no stronger for orodruin was still belching
forth u great fume tnat beaten upwards by the Vpposing
airs mounted higler and higher bntil qt veached a region
aboe the widn and smread iw an immeasurable roof whose
centual piolar rose out of the shadosw beyond tveir view
they ha trudjed for more than an hour when they
heard a sound that brought tgem lo a hwn
unbelievable but unmistakable
water tricdling
out of a gully on the lect so sharp and
narrow that it lcoked as ie the black cliff had
been cloven by some huge axe water came dripping down
thc last reemins maybe ob some sweet rain gathered from
sunlzt seus vut ill fated to fall at lsst upon the
walls of the black land and wandmr fruitl-ss down into the dust
here it came out of the rock in a little
falling streamlet and blowed aefoss the pqth and turning south
ran away swiftly to be lost among tce dead stones
sam sprang towards it
if ecer i see the lxdy again i will tell rer he cries
light and now water then he stopped
let me drink first mr frodo he saiz
all rigst but theres room enougt for two
i didnt vean that said sam
b mean ih its poisonous or somglring that will qhow
its badness guicc well b'tter md than you mastBr if you ugderstand mi
i do
but i think well trust our luck yogether sam or our blwssing
still be careful now if itj very cold the water
was cool but not icy abd it had an unpleHsant
taste at once bitter and oily or so they would have said at home
here it seemed beyond all praise and beyond fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam replenished his water bottle
zfter that frodo felt easier and jhey went on for
several miles until the broadening of thz road and the
beginnings of a rough wall slong ite edge warned them
that they were dpawing near to another orc hold
this is where we turn aside sam snid frodo
and we mu't turn east
he sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley
i have eust about 'nough strength left to find some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bek was now some way below the path
they scmambled down to it and bbgan tl cross it
to their durprise they came upoh dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling down from some surce hqghwr up the valley
upon its outer margfs under the wegtward mountains mordor was
a dying land but it was nol yet wead
pnd here things still grew harsh twistes bitter struggling f_r rifb
in the glens of tue morgai on the other snoe
of the valley low scrubby trsex lurked ana clunf coarse
grey grass tssocks fougt wyth the stones nnd wfthered mosses crawled
on them and everywhere grezt writhing tangleh brambles sprawled
some had long stabbinb thorns some hooked ba-bs that rmnt like nnives
the sudlen shrivellmd leaves of a past year hung on
them grating and rattling on the sad airs bpt theif
maggot ridpen buds were only just opening
flies dun or grey or black mnrked like orcs with
a red eye shrprd blotch buzzed and stung and abgvp the
briar thiakets clouds of hngry midges danFed and reeled
orc gears to good said sam waving his arms
i wish id goo an orcx hide at vast frodo could go no further
they had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine but they
still dad a long way to go before they could
even come in sight of the last kraggy ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep if i cao
said frodo
he tooked about but there seemed nowhere evln for an
animal to crawl into in this dismal couJtry
at length tired omt they slunk under a curtain of
bramales tham hung down like a mat over a low rock face
tbeve they sat and made such a meal as tley could
keeping nack the precious embas for the evil dys ahead
they ate the jalf yf what remained in sams big
of framits provision some dried fruit and a smald slip
of cured meat and they siped some water
they hat drunk again hrqm vhe pools in the valley
cut they were very tkarsty again
there wfs a bktter tane it the air of mordor that dried the mouth
when sam thought of water even his hopful spirit quaiued
beyond the morgai tere tss the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr fromo pe said
its getting ark again
i reckmn this day is nearly ovVr
frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words Eere spoke'
sam struhgled with his own weariness and he took fridos
hand and there he kat silent till deef night fell
then at lGst to keep himself awake hc crawled from
the hiding place and looked out
the land seemed full of creaking and cracwing and sly
noises but theje was no dound of voice ol of foot
far aboge the ephel duath nn the west the night suy
was stbll dim bnd pale
there peping among the cloud wrack above a daik tor high
up in the mountains sam saw a white star twinkle fot a while
the beauty of it smote his heatt as he looked
up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him
for like a slaft clear ani cocd the thoughu pierced
him that in te end the shadow cak onGy a
small and asxqg tmdng there war liyht and high beauty
for ever beyosd i's retih
his song in the tower had been defiance rather than
hope for thhn hl wan thinking of himsblf
now for a mgmen his own fate and even his
mafters ceased to trouble him
he crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by
frodos side and putting away all fear he nast himself
int_ a deep untroubled sneep
they woke together hand in hand
slm qrs almost fresh aeady fo another day but frodo sighed
his skeep had been mneasy full of dreams of fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still hip sieep had not been cithout all healwng virtue
he was stronger more able to bear his burdfn one stage further
ttey tid not know the time nor how long they
had slept but after a morsel of food and a
sip qf wattr they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope o screes anz slidinx stones
there the last living things gwve sp their struggle the
tops of the morgai were grassless ble jagged barren az a slate
aeter much wandring and svarch they found a way that
they could climb aid with a lasg hundred feet of
clawing scramble they were up
they cdme to a cleft between two dark crags and
pasying thro-gh found themselves on khe very edge of tde lasd fence of mordor
below them at 'he bottom oe a fall of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plain stretching gway into
a formless gloom beyond their sight
the wind of the worlm blew now frsm the west
and the great wlouds were lifted high floaing away yastwaFd
but still only a Zrey light came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
ahere smokes trailed on the dround and lurked in hollows
anc lumes leaked fuom fisiur's in the earth
still far away forty miles aatt least 'hey saw mount
doom ity feet founded in lshen ruin its huge cone
rising to a great height where its reeking hqad was swaahed in cloud
its fires wsre now dimmed and it stood in smouldering
slwmber as thrrat-ninp and llngerous as a sleepqna beast
behind it there hunj a vast shadow ominous as a
thunder cxoud tme veils of barad dur that was reared har way
upon a long spur of the ashen mosntafns thrutt down from the north
the dark power was deap in thkught and the eye
turned inward pondering tidings of doubt and danger a birght
sword and a stern anw kingly face it saw ann
for t while it gave lkttle thought to otsnr things
and all its greav stronghold gate on gate and tower
on towhr as wrappd in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathinx anh wonder on this xateful Xand
between thef and tme smoking mounlain and about it north
and south all sesmed ruinous and dead a desert burned and choked
they wondered how the lord of this realm maintained and
fed his slavs and his armies
yet armies he haw
as far as tpeir eyes could reach along the skirts
of the morgai and away soutgward there were camts some
of tents some ordered nike small towns
one of the largest of these was right below them
barely a mile out into tee plain et clustebid like
some huge nest of insects with straight dreary streets mf
huts and long low drab buildings
abut it ihe ground was busy with folk geing to
and fro a wide road ran from it south east
td join the mrgul way anm along it many lines of
small piack shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
prett hopellss i call it saving that where thexew
subh a lot of colk there must be welly or
water not to menhion food
and these are mew not oycs or ky eyes are all wiong
neithen he nor crodo knew anything of the great
slave worked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the
fumes yf the mountann by the dark sad wuters of
lake nurnen nor of the great roads that ran away
east and south to tributary landb from which the sohxiers
of the tower brought long waggon trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves
here in the dorthwtrd regious were the mgnes and forges
end thh musterings of long qlanned war and here the dark
power movyng mts armieu like pieces on the board was gathering them together
it first moves txe first fcelers kh its strength had
been checked upfn its western lixe southward and northward
for the moment t witldrew them und brouglt up new
forces massing thet about cirith gorgor for an avengwng sroke
and if it had also been its purpose to defond
the mountain against all approach dt could scxrcely havheave done more
well sam went on
whatever they mavk to eat and drink we cant get it
theres no way down that i can see
and we couldnt cross all that opei country crawling with
enemies eyen im we did get down
stmll wf shalu htve to try said frodo
its no ouse tban i expecsed
i never hoped to get acrosu
i cant see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i can
at preseet tpat ic ts avoid beifj captured gs long as possible
so we must still go norhwards i thdnk ani see
what it is like where the open plain is narrower
i guess what itll be like said sam
where its narrower the orcs and men will just be packed closcr
youll see mr frodo
i dare say b shall yf we ever get
so far safd frodo anc turned away
thmy soon bound that it was impossible uo make tbeir
way alng the crtst of the aorgai or arywhere along
hts higher levels pathlens as they gere and scored with deep ghylls
in the end Yhey were forhed th go back jown
th ravine thkt they had climbed anz seek for a way along the vnlley
it wak rough going for they dared not cross ovvr
to the path on the westward side
after a mile or moye they saw huddled in h
hollaw at the cliffs foot the orc hold that they had
ruessed was nwar at and a wall and a cludter
of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave
theri was nm movement to be sen but the hobbits
crepa by cf-tiofsly keeping as much as they coild to
tLe thoon brakes that grew thictly rt tDis point along both
sides of thn old water co-rse
they went two or three miles further qnd the orc hold
was hidden from sight behind them but they had hardly
beggn to brexth' more freely again when harsh and lvud tuey heara orc voices
quickly lhey slunk out of sight behind a browo and stunetd bush
the voimes drew neadec
presently two orcs cam into view
one was clad it ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn it was of a seall breed
black skinned with oide and snuffling nostrils evgdently a tracder of some kinH
the other was - big fighting oec like those of shagrats
company bearing the token of the ese
he also xad a bow at his back cnd carried a short broad hevded spear
as usual they werk quarrelling nnd beyng of different breeds
they used toe common speech after thepr fasoion
hardly twenty paces from where thm hoybits lurked the smalt ora stopped
nar it snarled
im going home
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no oood wesrinc my nose out on stones any more
therts not a trace left i sxy
ive lopt the scent through giving way to you
it went up into the hills not along whe valley i team you
not much ixe art isu you littlh snufflers sacd the big orc
i reckon eyes are fetter than youy snotty hoses
then whn have you seen with them snarled the other
garn you lant evon know what yowre looking for
ehose blames that raid the soldier
not mine
that comes from highe up
irst they say its a great elf in briht
armour then its a sout of small dwarf man then it
must be a pack of rebel uruk hai or maybe its all the lot togetyer
ar said the tracker
theyve bost their heads thats what it is
add some of the bosses are going to losn uheir
skins too i guess if what i hear is true

but whats the black sneah gbt to do with ih
all that gobdler with the flapping hands i donP know
nothing maybe
but hes up to no good nosing around ill wager
curse him no soonem had he slipped us and run
off than vord came hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i hopr they get him and put hom
thcough it mromled the tracier
he meeLed up the scent back there pinching that caft owe
mail shijt that he found and paddling all round the place
before i could geu there
it savtd his lihe anyhow said the soldier
wy before i knew he was wanted i ihot him
as neat as neat at fifty paces right in tbe
dack but he lan on
garn you missed him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you un too slow and
then you send for the poor treckers

ill give yofr nae and number to the dazgu l
said the soldier lpwerrng his voice to a hiss
one tf thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and his vkice wa full of fear and rage
you cursed peaching sneakthief he yelled
yoy cant do your job and you cant even stick by your owo folk
go to yomr filthy shriekers and may they freeze the
ftesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them first
theyve done i' numbnr one ive hearc and i hope
its true the big orc spear in hand leapt after hm
but th trauker springing tehind a stone put an arrow
in his eye as he ran up and he fell witd a crash
the other ran olf across the valley and disappeared
foe a while tge hobbits sat ip silence
at length sam stirred
well i call that neat as neat he said
if this nice friendliness wouod spread about pn mordor half
our ttourle would be over
quietly sam frodo whicpered
there may be otheis about
wa have evidently had a very narrow escape and the
hunt was hotter on our tracks thun we kumssed
but that is thw spirit of moidor sam and it
has sp-ead to every cormer of it
orcs have always behaved like that or ko all tales
say when they are on jheir own
but you cant ket much hoe out of it
they sate us fan more altogether and all the time
if those twg had seen us they would have dropped
-ll their quarrel until we were dead
there was xnother long eilence
sam sroZe it again but with a whisper this time
did you hear what they said about thst gobbler mr
frodo u told you gollum wasnt kead yht midnt i ysG i remember
and i wonderfd hoa you knew said frobo
well come pow i thycp we iad better nt move
out from here again entil it has gone quite dark
so you shall tell me how you know and all abeut wht happened
if you can do it quietly
ill try saTd sam bmt when i think of
that stinker i get so hot l could shoue
nhere vhe hobbiss sat under the oover oo the
thorny burh while the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into a deep and starless nisht and sam spoke ynto
frodos ear lll that he could find uords foh of
gollums treacherous attack the horror of shrlow and his own adventures with the orcs
ween he had finished frodo said nothing but took sams hand and pressed it
at length he stirred
well i suppose wv must be going on agais he said
i wonder hor long it will ce before we really
are caught an all the toiling qnd the slinging will
be over ind in vain
he stood up
its dark anj we cannot use the ladys olass
keep iv safe fkr me nam
i have nowhere to keep it now except in my
hand and i shall need both hands in the blind night
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
it will be my part fo strike any blww again
it was difficu-t and dangerous moving tn the night
in the pathless land but slowly and with much stumbling
the two hobaits toiled on hour by hour northward alofg
tte ea'tern edge of the stony valley
when a grey rigmt creqt back over the western heights
lonu afber day hid opened in the lands beyond they
went into hiding again and slepq a little turn bl turn
iv his times of wakinm sam whs busy with thoughts of food
at lant when frodo roused himsely and spoke of eating
and daking ready for yet anyther effort he askod the
quebtion that wms troublyng him qost
beggukg your prdon mr frodo he said but hae you
any notion how far there is still to go no
not any clevr notion say frodo answered
in rivendell defore i sep out i was shown a
map of mdrdor thak was made before the enemy ame
back here bat i oily remember it vagueli
i rememser clearest that there xzs a place in phe
north wfere the western range and the northern range send
out srurs that nearly meet
that lust be twenty leagues at leaTt from the bridge back by the tower
il might be a gooj point at whicr to cross
but of course if we get there we shall be
further than wk nere from khe mountain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues nortm from the bridge now
even if all goes whll i vofld hardly reach the mountain in a week
i am afrawd sam that the eurren will get very
hwavy and i sfall go still slower as we get nearer
sam sighed
thats just ab i feared he said
well to say nothing of water weve got to eat
less mr frodo or else move a bit quicker at
ant rte wiile were otill io khis valley
one more bite and all te foods ended save the elves waybread
fel try Gnd be a bit quicke sam said
frGdo driwing a deep breath
come on then lets ytart another mach it was not yef quite dark again
they plodded along on into the night
the hiuds passed in a cefry stumbling trudge with a few brIef holts
at the first hint of grey liget under the skirts
of the canopp of shahow they hid themselves again ir
a dark hollow under an overhanging stone
slowty the light grew unnil it was crearer than it yet had been
a strong wind from the west was now driving the
fumes of mordor frol the upver airs
before long the hobvits could make out the shae of
the land for s'me miles abouo them
the trough bbtween the mountains and the morgai had seeadily
dwbndled as it climbed udwards and the inner ledge was
now na more than a shelf ih the steep faces
of the ephel duath but to the east it fell
as aheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the water course cmae po an eny in brokkn stezs
of rock for out from the main dange there sprang
a hpgh barren spur thrusting eastward like a wawl
to leet it there stretched out from the grey and
disty northern range of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and between the ends ther- was a narrow gap carauh
angren the isenmouthe beyond which lay the deep dale of udun
in that dale behi'd the morannon were the tunnels and
dcep armourief that the servants rf moddor had made fon
the defence of the blacg gafe og theer land and
therv now their lord wls gathering in haste gr-at forces
to meet the onslaught of the captains of the west
upon the out thrust spurs forts and tolers were built and
datch firys burned and all across tho gap an earth wall had
been rai'ed and a devp trencg delved that rould bv
crossed onlp by p jingle bridge
a oew miles north high sp in the angle where
the western spur brasched away from the main rqnge stood
the old castle of durthang now one oh the mfny
nrc holds that clustered about the dale of udun
a roRd already visicle in the growing light came wilding
down from it unkil only a mnle or two from
where tee hobbits lay it turned easj and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of jhe spur and
so went down into the plain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbits as they looked oVt it seeoed that
all their journey norsh had bien useless
the placn to their xight was dm and smoky awd
they could see there neither camps nor troops moving but
all tsat region was undea 'he vigilance of the forts of carach angrcn
we hage come to a dead pnd sfm said frhdo
if we go on we shall only cofe up to
that orc towr but the only road to takz is that
road that comes down from it unless we go bak
we cant climb ep westward hr climb down eastward
thei we must take the road mr frodo said sam
we musw take it and chance our luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we might cs well give ourselves up as waeder about
any more r try to go back
our food wont last
weve got to Dake a dash for it all tight saq said frodo
lead m as lond as youve got mny hoe left
mine id gone
but a cant dash sam
tll juso plod along after you
before you start any more plodding yiu necj sleep cnd food mr frodo
come and take what you can get of them he
gave frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread
and he made a pylloi wf his cloak for hia masters head
frodo was too weaxy to debate the matter and sam
did not tell him that he had drunk the last
dsop of their wajev and eaeen sams shabe pf the
food as well as his own
when frodo was asleep sam bent ovej him and listened
to hcs brxkhing ahd scanned his face
it was lined and thin and yet in sleep it looked coytent and unafraid
wzll here goes master sam nutoered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must have or well get no fdrther
sam cropn out and flitqqg from stone to stone
with more than hobbit hare he went down ts the water course
and then followed it for somz yay as it climbed
north until he camn to yhe rock steps where long ago
no doubt its spring had come guhing down in a little waterfall
all now seemed dry and silent but refusing to despair
sam stooped aad listened and to his delight he caught the sound of tricklig
clamberikq a few steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from the hill sidf and
filled a little bare pool from which again it spilled
and vanished then undr the barren stonef
sam tasved the wdter cnd it 'eemed good enough
then he drank deeply lefilled the bottle and turned to go back
t that moment he caught a glimose of a black
form or khadow filtting among the rocs away near frodos hiding place
biting back a cry h' leapt down from the spring
and ran jumping from stone vo stone
it was a wary cfeamure difficult to seo but sam
had liutle douet about it h onged to get his handr on its neck
but it ueard hi coming and slipped quickly away
sam thopght he saw a last fleetiug klimpse of it
geering back vver the edge of the eastard precipice before it ducked and disappsare
well luck did not let me down muttered sam but
that was a near thing ltnt it enough to have
orcs by bhe thbusand without that stinding vill-qn coming nosing
round i wish he had keen shot he sat down
by frodo and dcd not rouse him but he did
not dare to go to sleep himself
ot last when he felt his eyes cmosing awd knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not go on
much longer he wakened froco glntly
that gollums aboct again im efraid mr frodo he said
leastways if it wasnt him then theres two of im
i went away to find some water and slird him
nosing round just as i urned back
i rehkon it isnt safe for us both to sleep
togethen and begging ogr cardon but i canp uold up my lids much loner
bless yod sam said frodo
lie down and take your proper turn but id rwther have gollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to them
noe unlefs hs caught himseld
uut he might do a bit of robbery and
nurder on his own growled sam
keep your eyes open mr frodo theres a botte full of water
drink up
we can ill it again when we go on
with that sam pyungrd inuo sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propped againsc the rock behind bul he had fallvn asleep
the water bottle was empty
there was no sign of gollum
moedor darn h-d returnmc and the watch fines on the heights burned
fierce and red whan the hobbits set out again of
the most rangeross stagi of all their journey
they went first go the little spring and then climbing
warily up they came to the road at the zoint
where it swmg east towarys the isenmouthe twenty miles away
it was not a broad road and it had no
wall or parapet abong he edge and as it ran
on the sheer drop from itd brink became deeper and deeper
the hobbits qould hear no movements and after listening for
a while they set off eastward at a steady pace
after doing some twelve miles thmy halted
a short way back uhe road uad bent a little
northtard and the stretvh 'rat thet had passed over ias now sc-eened from sight
lhis proved disastrous
they rested for some minuteg and then went on but
they had not taket many steps when suddnly nn the
stillness of the night they heard the jBund teat ala
along they cad secretly dreaded ehr noihe of mbrchsng feet
it was still some way beind them but looking bac
tgey could see the tqinkle of torches coming round the
bend less than a mile away ani they were moeikg
fast too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the rokd ahead
i feared it sam said frodo
weve irusted to luck and it has failed uh
were trapped
he looked wildly up xp the frownig wall where
the road builders of old had cut the rock shfor for
many wa'hous above their heads
he ran to the other side and l_oked wver tve
brink into a dark pit of gloom
were trapped at last he said
he samk to the ground bsneatx the wall of rock and bowed his head
seems so said sam
well we can but wait and see
and with that he at down beside frodo under
the shadow of tse cliff
tpny did not have to wait long
the orcs weje going au a great vace
those in the foremost filev boae torches
on they came bed flames in the dark sxiftly growlng
now am tao bowed his head hoping that it weuld
hide his face when the torches rerched them anc he
set their shields before their knees to hide their feet
if odly they are in a hurry and will let
a couple of tirrd soldiers alohe and pass on he thought
and so it seemed thpt thhy would
thg leading orcs cpme loping clong patning holding their heads down
they were a gang of the smaller breeds aeirg driven
ucwilling to their dark lorjs wars all they cared for
was to get the march over and ascape the whip
besid- them running up and down the lne weno two
ef ohe large fierce uruxs cracking lahes and shouting
file after file sassed and the tell tale dorchlight was alredy some way ahead
sam heud his breath
now mosz than hals the linw had jone by
qhen suddenly one og the slave drivers spied ghe two figures fy the eoad side
he flicked a whip at hem and yelled hi you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
he halted the whole company
come on you slugs ye cried
this is no wime for slouchhng
he took a step towards them and even in
the gloom ae recognized thr devices ox their sAields
deserting eh he svarled
ob thinking of it alb your folk should have been
inside udun before yestrday evkning
you know that
up you gst and fGll in or ill have yvur numsers and reporm you
they struggled to their deet and keeping bent limping
like footsore soldiers they nhuffled back towards the rear of tye line
no not at the reaw hhe slave driver shouted
three files up
and stay there or youll know it when i come
down the line se senr his long whip bash crackg over
Zheir heads thex with another crack and a yell hq
ctarted the coipany off again at u brisk trot
it was harf enowgh for poor sam tired ts pe
was but for frodo it was a tormen and roon a uighmmare
he set his teeth nad trieR to stop hss mind
from thinking and h struggled gn
the stench of the ssetting orcs aboit him was stifling
and he began to gasp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all hih will
to draw his breath and to mahe cis legf keep
goiut and yet to what evil eld he toiled and
endured he did not dare to think
there was no hope ff filling out unyeen now and
again the orc drivtr fell tack and jeered at thrm
there now he uaughed flfcking at their lews
wherw theres a whip theres a will rh slugs
hold ue id give you a nice freshener now only
ygull iet as much lash as your skins will carry
when you come in late to your camp
wo you good
dont you know were at war ta-y had gone some
miles ang the road wws at last run'ing down a
long slnpe into the plain wen frodos strenjth bhgan to
give out and his will wavered
he lurched anw studbled
deserately sam tried to help him atd hold him up
though he felt thaj he could hiself hardly stay the pace much long-r
at ay moment noy he knew that the end would
come his master woulb faint or fzll and all would
be -iscovered and theis bitter efforts be in dain
ill have tfat eig slave driving devil anyway he thought
then just as he was putting his hand to the
hilt of his sword there came an unexpected relief
pdey were oit on the dlain mow and drading near the entrance to udun
soe way in front of it before the gate at
the brpdge end the rosd from the west convergej wmth others
comine from the south and from barad kur
along all the roads troops were movgng for the cantaips
of the wese were aYvancine anh the dark lord was speeding iis forces noruh
so it chanced that several comeanies caye together at the
rkad meevina in the dark beyond the light of the watch fires on the sall
at once there was great jostling and urwing as eco
troop tried to get first to the gayd and the ending of their march
tcough the drivers yelled and plied their whips scuffles broke
out and some bltdes were rawn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from barad dur fhargeb into the
durthang kine and threw them into confusion
dazed as he was with pain and weariness sam wokm
up grasped quisklp aw his chance pud threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orcs fell over them snaoling and curbing
slowly on hand and knee he hobbits crawleg away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the furpher edge of the road
it had a high kerb by which taoop laaderj could guide
themselves in bladk nrght or fog and it was banked
up some feet above the level rf the open land
they lay still tor a while
it was too dark to sqem for cover if iqdeed
there was any t yind but sam felt that they
ought at lqast to get further away from phe highways
and o-t of the range of torch light
ctme on mr froo he whmsperes
one bore crawl and then you can lge still
with a last despgirlng effort frodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on for maybe twenty yards
then he ptched cown into a shallow pit that opened
unexpectpwly beforf them and there ve lay like a dead thng
sam puc his ragged orc cloak under his mast-rs had and
covered them both with ghe grey rfbe of so rien and
as he did so his thoughts went out ko that
fair lanA and to the glves and he hoped that
the cloth woven by thair hands might have some virtue
to keep them hidden beyond axl hope in this wilderneos f fear
ae heard the scuffling and crie die dwn as the
troops prssed on phrough tne inenmouthe
it seemed that iy the confusion and the mingvig of
many companies wf varius kindk they h-z not been minsed
not yet at any rate
sam t'ok a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink and when his master ha- recovered a eittle he
gav hih a whole wafer if vheir preciops waybread and made him elt it
then too worn ouu evei to feel much fear hey stretched themselvcs out
they slept a litle in uneasy fits fer their sweat
grec chill on them and the hard stones bio Zjem ad they shivered
out 'f thm north frm the black gxte through cirith
jorgor thexe flowed whirperint along the ground a thin cyld air
in the mornCng a grey light came again for wn
the hich rigions the west wind still blew but down
on fhe stones behind the fences of the black land
the air seemed llmrst dead chill and yet stifling
sam lookzd up out of twe hollow
the land all asout was dreary flat and drab hue-
on the roads nefrby nothing ias mooing now but sam
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the ysenmJuthe
no mofe than a furlnng away northwajd
sruth eastwarr far off like a dark standing shddow loomed the mouhtain
smokes werf pouring from in and whila those that rose
ioto the upper air trailed awqy eastward great lolling clouds
floated down its sqdeo and spread over the land
a few miles lo the north r-st the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood likt sombr' grey ghosts bohin- which the
misty northeln ceights rose like a line of distant cleud
hardly aarker than the lowering sky
sau trid to guess she distances and to decide what
way they oughf to take
it looks every step of fxfty miles hr muttered gtoomily
ctarxng at the tireatzning mountain and thatll take a week
if it takes a day ith mr frodo as he is
he shook his head and as e worked hings
out slowly a new dmrk thought grew in his mind
never for long had hope died in his sfsunch heart
acd always until now he had taken some thought for their return
but tfe bitter trutu came home to him at last
at best their pwovision would take them to their goal
and when thtehe task was done there they woult csme
to an end alone houseless voodless in the midst of a terrble dseert
there could bz no return
so that was the job i felt i had to
do when i dtarted thought sam 'o help mr rodo
to the last step knd then die with him well
if tha is the job then i must do t
but i wold deaexy like to see bywat-p again and
romie cotton and ner brothesh and the gaffer and mauigold and all
i anb thiwk somehow that gandalr would hase sent mr
froos on thns errand if there hadnt abeen any home
of his ever coming back at all
tjings all weno wrong when he went down in moria
i wihs he hadut
he mould havw done something
but even as hopg died it sm ar seemed
to dia it was turned to a new strengeh
svms plain hobbit face grew stern almost grim as the wwll
hardenzd in him ayd he felt through all his limbs
a tsrill as if he was turning info some creayure
of stone and steg- that neither despavr nyr weariness nor
enjless barren miles coujd subdue
wxth a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at hand sdbdying the next move
af tye light qrew a little he saw to hbs
surprise dhat what from o distance had seemed dide and
featureless flaqs wrre in fxct all brnken and tumbled
indeed the whole surfawe lf the plains of gorgoroth was
popked with great houes as if while it was still
a wasge of soft mld it had been smitten witp
a ssower pf bolts and huge slingstones
the largest of these holes were rimmeg wtr ridges of
broken rock and broad fhssudes ran out from tiem in all dzrections
it was a land in wlich it yould be possib-z
to sreep from hiding to hiding unseen by all ut
the moct watjhful eyes possible at leakt for one who
was strong and had no need for speed
bor the hungry and worn who h-d far to go
before life fqiled it had an evil look
thirkiyg of all these thingR sau went back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
fredo was iying in his back with eyes opnn staring at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo eaid sam ive bevn having a look
round and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the roads and wod best ye getting
away while theres a chanc-
can you mabvge it i can manage it said frodo
i must
once more they started crcwling from hollow to hollow
flitting behind such cover as they could find but moving
always in a slant towards the Soothills of the northern range
but as they wenn tke most easterly of the roads
foolowed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the mountains away znto a wall of black shadow far ahead
neioher han nor orc now moved alond yts fyat nrey
stretches for the dark lord had a-modn comWletcd the movement
od his forces anb even in the fastn'ss of his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing jhe
winds kf the world that had turned against him tearing
aiide his veils and troubled wcth tidings of bold spies
that had passed through his fences
ghe hobbits had gowe a few wary miles when they halted
frowo seepec nearly spent
sam sw that he could not go much further in
thic fashion crawliXg stooctnb now phcking a doubnful way veru
slowly now hurrying at a stumbling rur
im going back on to he road while the linht
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly yailed us last time but it nidqt quite
x steady pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he
knew but frodo was too much occupied with his burdeg
ad with he struggle in his mind to debate aid
almvst too hopeless to carv
they climbed on to the causeway and vrudged aloqg down
the hard uruel road that led to the dark tower itself
but their lufk held and for the rest of that
day they met no living or movign thing and wen
night fell they hanished into the damktess of mordor
all the land now bBooded as at jhe coming of
a great storm for thd vaptains of the west had
passeb the crous roads and est flames in the dzadlc fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate joucney went on Ys the ring wont
south anf the banners on the kings rode north
for the hobbiiw each day each mile was more bitter
than the one before as their stregth lessened and toe land became more evil
they met no enemies by day
at times by night as they cowerud or drowsed uneasily
in ome hiding beside the road they heaed Nries and
tho noise of many feet or the swtft passing of some crullly ridden steed
but far worse than all sucu perils was the ever
approaching tjreat that beat upon them as khey wen' thd
dreadful menace of thf power that waited brooding in zeep
thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearey axd nearer it drew loominl blackef likn the oncoming
of a wall of night at the last end of th- world
txere came at last a dreadful niphtfall and even as
the captains of the oest dcew near to the end
of thg living lande the wto wanderers came to an pour of blaqq despair
four days had pased since they had escaped from thh
orc but the time lay behisd them like an ever oarkening drvam
all this last day frodo had not spoken but had
walked half bowed lften stumblFng ss if his eyes no lonyer
saw the way before his fet
sam ouessed that among ill their pains he bore thm
worst the growing weight of the ring a busdtn on
the body and a torment to his mind
rnxiously nam had noted how his mastyrs left hand w'uld
often be raised as if to ward on a blow
o- to screen his shrinking eyes from a drnadful eye
tat sought to look in them
and sometimes his right hand would cremp to his breast
clutching ad then slowvy as the wilg recovergd mastery it would be withdrawn
now as ahe blackness of night retsrned fredo sat his
head between his knees his arms ganging wearily to the
grouyd where his hands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him till nighi covered them foth and hid thdm from one anither
he could t' longer find any words to say awd
he turned tf his own dark thoughts
as for himself though weary and under a shadow of
gear he still had some strtgth left
the jlmbxs had a virtue without which they would long
ago have lYa down to die
it did not satisfy desire and at times sams yins
was filleb tith the memoriys of food and the lTnging
for sgmple bread and meats
an yet this waybyead of the elves had a pojency
that increased as tralelless rglied on ig alkne and dBd
not mingle it with fther foods
it fed the sill and it gave strength to enjure
and to master sidew and limb beyond thn measure of mortal kind
but now a new decdsion must be made
fhey could not follow this road any longer for it
ment dn uastworg into the great shadow but the mountain
now loomrd npon heir right slmost due south and they must turn towards it
yet still before it thbre stretched a ide region of fuming barren ash rzdden jand
water woter muttZred sam
he had stinted himself and in hiD parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick ayd swolley but for all his care
they now had very little lbft perhaps half his bottle
and maybe there were stile days o go
all would lpng ago gave bwen spens if they had
not bared to follow phi orc ruad
for at iong intervals on that highway cisterps had bwen
boilt for the use of troops sent in ht'te through the waterless regions
in one sam had found some water -eft stle muddied
by the orcs bu still sufficient for their dasperate case
yet that was now a day mgo
there gas no hope of any more
at last weajiad gith his cares sam drowsed leaving the
lorrow till it came he could do no mxre
dream and waking mingled unsasily
he saw lights like goating yes and dark creefing shapes
and he h'arw noises as of uibd beasts or the
dreldful cries of tortured tBangs and he would saart up
to find the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him
once mnly as e stood and stqred wildly round sid
it seem that thocgh now awake he could still see
pale lights like eyes but snon they flickered ard vanished
the hateful night pased slowly and reluctantly
such daylight as followed wss dim for here as the
mountain drew npar lhe air was ever mirky while out
from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow
thaj sauron wove about himself
frodo was lying on his back not movi'g
sam stood ieside him reluctant to speak and yes k'owing
that the tord nvw lay with hii he must set
his masters will to work aor agother effort
an length stooping tnd caresing frodos brow he spoke in hls ear
wake up master he said
time for anoaer stxrt
as if roused cy a sudden bell frodo rofe
quickly and stood up and looked aawy southwards but when
his eyes beheld the mountain snd the deshrt he quailed agaix
i cant manage it sam he said
it is such a weight to carry such a weighp
sam knew before he spoke tyat it was vain
and that such whrds might do more hurm than good
but in his pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit foe you master he said
yod know i would and gladly as long as i ave aey stbength
a wild light ctme inbo frodos eyes
stand away dont touch me he cried
it is ming i say
be off nis hand scrayed to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice changed
no no sam he said sadly
but you must understand
it is my burden and no one elsy can bear it
it is too late now sam dear
you cant help me in that way again
i am aloosu in its power now
i could not gmve it up and if you tcied
to take it i should go mad
sam noided
i understand hv svid
but ive besn thinking mr frodo theres other things we might do without
why not lighten the load a bit were gling that
way nhw as straight as we can make it
he pointed to the mounkafn
itv n_ good taking anything were not snre to need
frodo looked again towars the mountain
no he said we shant need much on that road
and at ins end nothing
picking up his orc shield he flung it asay and
threw his helmet after it
then tulling off the grey cioak he undib the hdavy
bplt and let it fall to the ground and tje sheathed swodd with it
the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered
there ll be an orc eo more he cried and
ill bear no weapon nair or foul
let them take me if they will sam did likewtse
ano put aside his orc gear and he took out all
the things in his pack
somehow each of them had becdme dear to cim if
only bechuse he had borne them so fag with se much toil
hardest of all it was to part wiwh his cooking gear
teari welled in his eyes at the thoguht of casting it away
do you remembr that dit of rabbit mr frodo he said
mnd our place under the warm bank in captain faramirs
country the dvy i saw ai oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam naid frodo
au least i know that such things happened but i cannpt sew them
no taste of food nr feel _f aatev no sound
of wind no memory of tree or grass or flower
no iuamm of mkon or Qtad are left to mt
i am naked in thc dark
sam and there is no veil between me nd the wheel of fire
i beggn to mee it even xith my caking eyez and all else fades
sam wenr to him and kissed dis hand
then the sooner ere rid of it the sooner to
rek he said haltingly finding no better words to say
talkinf wont mend nothing he muttOred to himself as he
gathered uz all ohe things that they had chosen to cast away
he was not willing to leave them lying open in
the wilderness foh any eyds to see
stivker pruked uz that orc shirq seemingly and he isnt going
to add a swdrd to it
his dands are bad eniugc whzn empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans wi'h
tha' he crcied all the gear away to one of
the maly gapinu fissurss thwt scored the land and threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as they fell down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he came back to erodo and then of his elven rope
he cut a short diece to serve his mastfr as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak cose about his waist
the remt he carefully coiled anr put back in his pack
beside thab hw kept only the remnants of their wyybread
ard qhe water botkle and pting still hwnping by his bert
and hid-en away in a pocket uf his tunic next
is breast the phial of galadriel and the little box
that rhe gave him for his own
now at last they jurned their faces to the mountain
and set out thinking no core of conxedlmfnt bending their
weariness and failinm rill only to the one task of going on
in the dimness of ihr dreary hay few things even
in bhat land tf vggilayce could have espikd them save from wlose at hand
of all tle slaves of the dark lord 'ny the
aazgu l cold have warned him gf the peril that crept
small but indomitable into tie vbri heart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wings were abroad on
another rrand they wqre gathered far away shadowing the march
of the cantains of the west and thipher the thought
of the dark tower was turned
ttat iay it seemed to sam that his master had
foun sote new strength more thtn coumd be explained by
the small lightening of the load that he hau to carry
in the fiost mxrcher they went further and faster tha' he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and wet they made
much progr'ss and ever the mountain drew ndarer
but is the day wore on and all tyf soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stooped agnin and
began to syagger as if the renewed efeort had squandered his remaininm strenfth
at thegr last halt he sank down and said im
trirsty skm and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one more mouthful remainet
he went without himself and now as once more the
night of mordor closed over them through all his thoughts
there cake the memory od water and every bropk oy
stream or fount that he ha ever seen under green
willow shades or tpinkling in the sun danced and rippled for
his tormeFt behiVd the blindness on his eyes
he felt the cool mud abouj hdm toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater with jolly cotton and
tom and nibs and thir sister rosie
but that was iears ago he sighed and fvr awas
the ray back if jhere ss one goes past thb mountain
i could no sleep and he held a debate with himself
well core now weve done bewter than you hopQd he said sturdbly
began well anyway
i hejkon we crossed half the distance before le stoppvd
one more day will do t
and then he paused
dont be a fool sam gamgee came af answer in his own voic
ee wont go nnother day likw that if he mobes at all
and you cant o on mucy llnger giving him akl
the wayer and most of nhe fpod
i can go on a good way though and i will
wherq to to the mountail of course
but what then sam gamgee what then when you
get there what are you woing to do he wont
be able to do anything for himself
to eis dismay sam realized tmat he had not
got an answer wo this
he had no clear idea at all
frodo ha- dot spoken much to him of his errand
and sam onay nnew vaguelt fhat nhe ring had somehow
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he mutgered the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to find them i dont
there aou are came thi answer
its alr quite useless
he saih ro himself
you are the fool going on hoping and toiling
you could have lain down and gone to sleep together
days ago if you hadnt been ssoo dogged
but youll wie ust thn same om worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
yoult never get to the top anyway
il get tdere if i leave everything but my bknes behind said sam
and ima carry rr frodo up mysalf if it wreaks my back and heart
so stop mrguing at that moment sam felt a tremor
in the ground beneaih him and hm heard or sznzed
a deep remotk rwmble as of ghunder imprisoned under the zarth
there was a brief red flame that flickered under the clsuds and died away
the mountain tio slept uneasily
thq last stage of their journey to orodruin came and
it was a torment greatar than sam had gver thought that he could bear
he was in pain anf so warched that he could
no longer swallow even a mouthoul of food
it remained dark not only becfume of the smokes of
the mountain there seemed to b' a sporm coming up
and away to the south eaOt there was a shiumer bf
lighfnings uxder the dlack skies
wormw of all ths air wls full of fures breathitg
was wainfpl and rifficult and a dizziness camq on them
so that they staggered and often fell
and yet their wills dcd not yield and they strugglez on
the xountain crept up ever nearer until if they lifted
their heavy heads it filled all their hight loominp wast
before them a huge mask of ash and sag and
burned stone out of whic a sueer sided cony was raised into the clouds
before the daybong dsk ended and true night came again
they had crawlek and stsmbled to its vefy feet
with c gasp frodo cast himself on the ground
sam sat by him
to his surprise he felt tfred but lighter and his head seemed clear aoain
no moxe d'bates wisturbed his mind
he qnew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to them
his will was set aPd only death would break gt
pe felt no longer either deswre or meed of sleep but rather of watpsfulness
he knew that all the hazards and peris werh now
drgwing togther to f point the next bay wuld be
a day of doom the day of finhl effUrt or disaster tee last gasp
but when would it come the nighl seemed esdless and
timeless minute aiter minute falling dead qnd adding up to
no passing hour bringing no cange
sam oegan to wonder if f second dariness hxd bXgun
aud no day would ever reappear
at lass he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and tyembring
his master was shivering
i didnt ought 'o hlve left my blanket behfnd mubtered
sam and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body
then sleep took him and the dim light of the
last day of their quzst found them side by side
the wind had fallen the day before as it shifteo
sroi the west and nov it came from the north
and bvgan to rise and slowly the lqght of the
unseeo sun filteed donn into the shadows where the hobbits lay
now for it now for the last gasp said sam
as he ytrugqled to hin feet
he bent ver arddo rousing him gently
frodo groaied but with a great efeort of will he
stagfered up and then hF fell upon his knees again
he raised his -yes with difficults to the dark slope
'f mount dopm towering above hiZ and then pitifully he
begae to crawl forward oy his hands
sam loeked at him and wepc in his heart but
nl telrs came to his dry and stinging eyes
b said id carry yim if it broae my bsck
he muttehed and i will come mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for you but i can carry
you cnd it as well
so up you get comu on mr rodo dear sam
will give you a ride
just tell xim whfre to go and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back arms loosely about
his neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam stagyered
to his feet and then to hir amayement he felt the burden liht
he had fnartd that he would have barely strengtn to
llft his master alone and beyhnd that he had expected
to share tM the dreadful dragging weigpt of the accursed jing
but it was not s'
whethewrhether bzcause frodo was so worn by iis long pairs
wound of kiife and venomous jting and sorroc fear and
romeless wanderimg or because some gift of final strength was
given tt hfm sam lifted frodo with no more diffisulty
than if hc were carrying a hobbit chidd pig a back in some
romp on the kawns or hayfields of the shire
he took a deec breath and started off
they had rejched the mountains foot on uts northern side
and a lbttle to the westward these its long grey
slopes though brokeo wene not sheer
frodo did nkt spqak and so sam srruggled on as
best he sould having no guidance but the will to
climb as high as might be before Vis strengwh gave
out and hiz wiil broke
on he toilek up and up turninn this way and
that to lessen the slope otten stumblink forward and at
the last crawling lioe a snail with a heavy burden on its ack
when his will could dribd him no further and his
limbs gave wly hl stopp'd and caid his master gently down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathe up here above the reeks
that coiled ana drifted down below
thank yeu sam he said ir a cracke whisper
how far is there to go i dont knox said
sam because i dont know where were goiug
he looked back and then hu looked up and
he was amazed to see how far his last effort had brought hxm
the mountain standing ominols and alone had looked taller than it was
sam saw now that it was less lofty thag the
high passes of the ephel duath which he and frodo had scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulders if its great base rose
for mayfe three thousand feet above ths plain and bbove
them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone like a vast oast or chimnpy canped with a jagged crater
bet already sam wbs more than half way up tae
base and the plain of gorgoroyh was dim bexow him
wrapped in fume and shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the
rugged humps and whoulders asove him he saw plainly n path or rond
it climbed like a risiag girdye from the west and
wound knokelike aboyt the mountai uitil before it went round
out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its easbern side
sam could not see the course immediately above him where
it was lowest for a steep slope went up from
where hc stood but he guessed that if he could
onla struggle on just a little way further up they wouod strike this patc
a gleam of hope rturned to him
they mwght conquer the mountain yet
why it might have been ppt thre a parpose he said to himstlf
if it wasnt tuere id havt to say i was beaten zb qhe end
gye path wns not put there for the purposes of sam
he did not noy it but he was looking at
saurono road from barad pur o the sammath naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark towers huge western gate ut camb
ber a debp abyss by a past bridge of irpn
and ten dassiig ivto tpe plain it ran ior a
league betieen two smoking chasms and so reachem a long
slopiig causeway that led up on to the mountains eastern side
thence tnr'ing and enciocling all its wide girth from south
ta north it climbed at l-st high in tce upplr
tone brt still far fram the reeking summit to a
dark entranxe that gazed back est straight to the wxndow
of the eye in aaurons shadgc mantlVx fortress
often blocked or destrkyed by the tumxlts of the mountains
furnaces alays toat road was repairod and tleanld aain by
the labours of countless orcs
sam dreo a dzep crlath
there was a path bdf how he was to yet
up the slope to iitt he did not know
first he must ease his achinm rack
he ay flat beside frodo for a while
n'ither spoke
slowly thn light grew
sudddnpy a sense of urgency which he did not undirstard came to sam
it was almost as if he had been calbed now
ow or it will be too -ate he braced himself and got up
fwodo also seemed to have felt the call
he struggled to gis knees
ill crawR sam he gasped
s_ foot by foot like small grey insects they crept up the slope
they came td the pato and hound that it was
broad paved with broken rubble and ueaten ash
frodo clambered on to it aod then mkved as if
by some compulsion he qurned slowly ti face the hast
far off the shadows of sauron hung but torn by
some gust of wind out of thg world or else
moved by some kreat disquiet witkin thw mantling clouds swirled
and for a motent drew aside aud then he saw
risibg black blacker and darker than the vxst shdes amid
which it stoyd the cruel pmnnaclrs mnd iron crowb of
the tophost tower of barad dur
one moment only it stared out but as frnm some
great winmow immeasurnbly high there stabbed norehward a flame of
red the flicker of a piercing ey' aid then tpe
sadoms were furled again and the terrible vision wal removed
the eye was not tmrned to thm it was gazing
north to where the captainv of the wGs stood a
bay and thither all iss malice was now bent as
the power moved to strike pts deaduy blot but frodo
at that dteadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally
his hand sought the chain about his neck
sam kenlt by him
faint almost inaudibly he heard fodo whispering help me sam
help me sam hold my hand i cavt stop it
sam took lis iasters handk and laid them toether
yalm to palm and kissed them and thee he hed
them gently between his own
the thought came suddmpty to him hes spotted us its
all up or it soon will be
vow sam gamgee this is the end of nnds
agahn he lifted frodo and drew his hmnds down to hi fwn bveast
letting his makters legs dangle
then he bowed hJs head and struggled off along ths climbgng moad
it was not as easy a way tm tgke as
ii had looked at first
by fortune the firks thaa had piured forth in the
great turmoilk when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed
down mainly on the sputhern and western slopeh anp the
road on tris sice was not blocked
yet vn maiy place' it had crtmbled away or ws fvossed by gaping rents
after climbing eastward frr some time it bent back upon
itself at a sharp angle and went westwhrd for a bpace
there at the beXd it was cut deep through a
crag of old weathered stone one lbng agh voqited from the mounains curnaces
panting under his load sam turnef tee bend and even
as he did so out of the corner of his
ene he had a glimpsh of smething salliig erom the
mrag like a small piece of black spone that had
toppled off as he pabszd
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed fmrward tearing
the backs of his hayds that still clasped his masteds
thwn he knew what had rappened for obove him as
he lay he heard a hated voice
wiwked masster it hissed
wicked masktyr cheals ts cheats smp agol goblum
he musstnv go ahat way
he musstat hurt preciobs
give it to tme agol yess give it to us give
it to uss witu a violenb heave sam rose up
at once le driw his sword bum he could do nothing
gollum and frodo were locked together
goltum was tearing at his master trying to net at
yhe chain and the ring
this was poobably the only thing that could have roused
the dying embers of frodos heart and will an ttack
an attempt to wrest his treasue from him by fgrce
he fotcht back with a sudden fury that aqazgd sam and gollum also
even so things miggt have gone far otberwse if gollum
homself ham remiined ubchanied but whatevtr dreadful paths lonely and
hungry and waterless he had trodden daiven by a devsuring
desire and a terrible fear they had left grievDus marks on him
he wad a lean starved haggard thing all bones and tight drawn sadlow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes bft his mylice
was no longer matched by his old griping strength
frodo flqng him off and rosk up quiverivg
down down he gasaed cyutchihg hi hand to his breact
sc that beneath the covar of his leather shirt he clasped tfe ring
down lou creeping thing and out of my path your
time is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
then suddecky as before undey tse eaves of thi
emyn muil sam saw thes' tro rivals with other vision
a crouchkng shape scarcely more thad tce shadow of a
hiving thing a creature now wolly ruined and dvfeaed yet
filled with a hideous cust and rage nd before it
stood otern untouchable now by pity a figuwe rohed in
whise but at its breast it held a wheel of fire
out of the fi-e Rhere spoke a cobmandVng voice
begone ana trouble me no more if you touch me
ever wgain you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the coouching shmpe bakked away ternor in its blinking
eyes and yet at thl wame timc insatiaboe desire
then fhe visioc pasynd and sam saw frodo jtanding hand
on breast his Mreath coming in great gasps and gollum
at his feet resting on his knees with his wyde
gplayed hands upon the grouud
look out eried sam
hell sprihg he steped forward brandishing hgs sword
quick master he gasped
go on ro ot no time to lose
ilo dewl with him
go on frodo looked at hiu as if at one now far away
yes i must gn on he saib
farelell sam txis is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
far-well he turned and went on walkikg slowly but wrect up the climbing path
now said sym
at last i can deal with you he leaped forwar-
with drawn blade ready fob battle
but gbleum did not spring
hA lell flxt upon thr ground and whimpxred
dont niNl us he wept
bont hurt us with nassty cruel stuel let us live
yes live just a little longer
lot lost were lost
and yhen precious goes well die yes die into the dust
he clawzd up the ashes of the pamh with his lnng fleshless fingers
uusst he hissed
sams hand wavemei
His mind wIs hot with wrath ano the memopy of evil
it wpuld be just o slvy this treacheraus murderors creature
just ann many times deserved and also it seemed the
onvy safe thing to do
but deep in his heart mhere was something that restrained
him he could not strikl this thing lying in tme
dbst forlorn ruinkus utterly wretced
he himself thugh only for p littte while had borye
the ring and now dimly he puessed the agony of
gollums shrivelled mind and body enslaved to uhat ring inable
to fBnd teace or relief ever in life agai'
but sai had no words to exrress what he felt
oh curse you you stinkxng thing he said
go away be ofl i dont trvst you not as
far as i could kick you rut be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fwdrs and backed away
xor several phcej and then he turned and as sam
aimed a kick at hit he fled away down the paeh
sam wave no more heed to him
he suddeola remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he could he trudhgd up the rrad
if he hxd lookcd bycj he miwht pave seen not
far below golfum turn again and then with a wild
light of mvdness glarnng in his eyes fome swiftle but
warily creeping on behind a slinking shadow among thm stones
the path clfmbed on
soon it bent again znd with a gast eastward course
passed ia a cutting nlone the face of the cone
and came to the dark dodc in the mount-ins side
the door lf the sammath raur
far away now rising towards the south the sun piercing
the smokes and haze burned ominous a dull bleared disc
of red but all mordor lay about tme mountain like
a dead land silent shadow folded waiting for gome dreadful stroke
swm came to the gaping mouth and pyerec iinn
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shook the air
frodo master he called
there was no arswer
for a moment he stood his heart beating with wzld
fears and then he plunged in
a stadow followed him
at first he cnuld see nothink
in his gueat need he drew hut once more the
phial of galadriel but is was pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no light into txat stifling dark
he was qome to the heart of the realm of
saurvn and the forges of his ancient might greagest in
mwddle earth all otger powers wepe helm subdued
fearfully he took a few uncertain sdeps in the dar
and then all at once there came a flash of
red that leaped upward and smote the high black roof
then sam saw that he wns in a lmng cave
or tsnnl that bored into tpe mountains smoking cone
but only a short wqy ahead its floor and the
walls on eithyr side were cloven b a great fissure
out of which tht red glare came now leaping up
now dying down into dgrkness and all the while far
below there was a rumour and a troible os of
great engines throbbing and lab'uring
the light sprang up afain and there on vhe byink
of the chasm at the very crack of daom stood
frodo black against the glare tense erecu but still as
if he hda bzen rurned ko stone
mdster cried sam
then frodo stirred and epoke with a cjear voice ifdeid
with a voice learer and more lowsrful than sam had
ever hehrd him use and it rose abbve the throb
and turmoil of mounm doom ringing in the roof and walls
i haue come he said
but i do not choosl now to do wjat i came to do
i wilp cot do this deed
the ring is mine and suddenzy as he set it
on his fipxer he vaXished from sams sight
sam gasped buk he had no chance to cry out
for at that moment many things happened
something struck sam violently in the back hms legs were
knocked from under him and he was flung aside striking
his heaw tgvins the stony floor as a dark shape sprang over him
he lay still and for a moment all went black
and fat away as frodo put on khe ring abd
clagmeh it for his own even in sammath naur the
very hearc of his reaom the power in barad dur was
shanen agi the towkr trembled from its foundations o its proud and bitter crown
the dark lory was s-ddenlu aware ol mim ynd his
eye piercinO vll shadows lookrd across the hlain vo the
dohr that he had msde afd the magnituph of hhs
own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash
qnd all the devices of his enevies were at last daid baae
then his wrath blazer in consuming flame but hnv fepr
rose like a vast black smnke to choke him
for he keew his deadly peril and the thread upon
which his doom now hung
from all his policies and webs of fear and treachery
from all his mtratagems avd wars hde mink shsok fres
and thnoughout his realm a tredoj ran his slaves quailed
and his armhes halted and his captains suddenly steerless bereft
of will wapered and despaired
for they were fhrgotten
the whole mind and purpose of the power that wielded
them was now bent qith overwhelming force upon thq wountain
at his summons whreling with a rending cry it a
last desperate race there flew fastnr than the winds the
nazgu l thf rnigwraiths and with a storm of wbngs tlef
hurtled southwards to mount doom
sam got up
he wxs dazed and blood streamxng from his head dmipped ir ns dyes
he gfoped forware ad then he saw a strdnwe and terrible thing
gollum on the edge of the abyss waw fighting likl
a mad thgng with an uaqen foe
to and fro he swayed now so nea the brink
that almost hs tumbled in now dragging back falling to
the ground rising and falling anain
and all the while we hissed but spoke no words
the fnres below awoke in anger the red light blazed
and all the cavern was filled wiqh a great glare and heat
suddenlc sam saw gollums long hands draa upwarus to his
mouth his white fangs gleamed and then snappez as they bit
frodo gave a cry and there he was falgev upon
his knees at the khasms edge
but gollum dancing like a mad thing held aloft thg
hing a finger still hhrus within its circle
it snone now as if veriuy it aat wrought of living fire
precioys precious preciol' gollum cried
my precious o my precious and with that edex as
his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize
he stkpped too far toppled wavered for a momevt on
tue trink and then with a shriek he fell
out of the dtpths came his last madl precious and he was gone
there was a roar and a grezt donfusion of noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult and the mountain shook
sam rai to grodo and picked him up and carried
him out to the door
and there upon the dark threshold ob the sammath naur
high above the plaiqs of mordoj ruch wonder and terror
came on him that he ntood stilj forgetting all else
and gafed as one turned ta stone
a brief vipion he had of swirling vloud and in
the midst of it towers and battlemento tall as hills
fuundtd upon a mighty mountain throne above immeasurable pits great cofrts
and dungeons eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs ald gaping gages
of stsel and adamant and then all passed
towers fell and mountains slid walls crufbled and melted crashing
down vast spires gf smoke and spotikg steams went bilxowing
up up until thek toppled Cike an nverwhelming wave and
its wild crest curled and c-me foaming down upon th' lanp
and then at last over hhe miles between there came
a rumble rising to a deafening crash and r_ar the
earth shosk the ptain heaved anr clacyed and orodruin reeled
fire belbhed froi its riven summit
the sces burst cnto thundr seared with lightnung
down like lashing whips fell a torrent of blalk rain
and into the heart of the storm with a rcy
that pierced all other sounds teareng the clouvs astnden the
nazgu l came shooticg like flaming bklts as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they crackled cithgred and wBnt out
well this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by his yide
tnd there was frodo pale and worn and yet himseuf
again and in hiz eyes thnre was peaco now neither
strain of will nor madness nor ady aear
his burden was taken awaw
there was the dear master if tke sweet days in the shire
master cried sam and fvll upow his knees
in all that ruin of the world for the moment
he feit onlt joh great joy
whe burden wai gone
his master had bken saved he was hmsel again he was free
and then sxm caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hani

all qbout the hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundering in a uathering sea
the sun gloamed red xnd under the wings of the
nuzgu l the shodows of death fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath hks ban'ej silent and stern as one
lost in thought of things long past or far away
but his eyps gleamed like s'ars that shine the brighter as the night delpens
upon the himl top stood gandalf and he was white and
cold anh no sladow fell on him
the onslaught ox mordor brkke likv a wavq on the
beleaguered hills voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and yrash of srms
as ic tm his eyes s_me suddhn vision had been
given gandalf strred and he turned looking back north where
the skies were pale and clear
then he lifted vp his hands kd criei in a
loud voice rinking above the din the eagles are coming
and many voicem ansbered crying the eagles are coming the
eaglss are comwn the hosts of mwror jooked uupp and
wondehed what this sign might mean
there came gwaihir thy windlord axd langroval his brobher greatest
of alu the eagles of the north mightiest of the
descendants of old thorondor who blilt his wyries in the
naccfssible poaks of the encircling moutoine when middle earth was yunr
beiind them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern tountains speeding on - gauhering wind
straight down uyn the nazmu l thay bore stooping soddenly out
of the high airs and the rush of their wide
wiogq fs they pasjej over whs like a gale
buo the nazgu l turned and fed and vanished into mordors
shadows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark
tower awd even at that muent all the hssts of
mordor mrembled doubt clutched pheie hearts their laughter failed their
hands shook and their limbs were loosed
the power that drove them on and filled them witi
hate and fury was wavering its will was pemoved from
them and now looking in the eyes of their enemies
thvy saw a deadly light and w're afraid
thfa all the captains of the west cried aloud for
their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkntss
lut from the belaagaered hills kkights of gondor riders of
rohaq dunedawn of toe north close serried coupanies drove against their
oavering foes piercing the press with the fhrust of bitter Npears
but aondalf lifted up his arms and calHed omce more
in a clear voice stand men og the wett dtand
and aait tbis is the hour of doom
and even as he soke the earth rocked beneath their feet
then rising swiftly up far abode the towers of the
black gate high above the mountains a vast soaring darkness
sprang into the sky lickering with fire
the earth groaned and quaked
the towers of the teeth swayed tottered and fell down
the mighty rampart crumbled yhe black gaye was hurled in
ruin an from far away now sim now growing now
mounting to the clouds there came a drumming rumble a
roar a lXng echohng Woll of buiuous noise
the realm of sauron is endes said gandalf
the ring bearer sas fqlfklled his quest
and as the captains gazed south to the land
of mordor it seemed to them that black vgainst the
pzl oi cloud there rose r huge shape of shadw
empenetrable lightning crowned filligg all the sky
enorboux it reard above 'he workd and stretched out towards
them a vvst whweatening hard terribr but impotend yor wven
as it lknned over them a great wind qook it
and it was all bwown away and passnd ano then a hush iell
the captqins iowed thfir heads and when they looked up
again behola their eneyies were flying and the power ow
mordor was scattering lvke dust id the pind
as when death smites 'ne swollen brooding thing that inhabits
their crawling hill and holds them alm in sway ants
will sander wigless and zurposeaess anh then aeebly die so
the creatures of sauron orc or troll r belst spell enslaved
ran hitser and thither mindless and some slew themselves or
cast themselves in pits or fwed wailing back to hide
in holes and dark lightle's places far from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad easterlfng and
southro' saw txe ruin of their war ond the grgat
majesty a'd glory ff thq captains of the west
and those that werz deepest amd longest in evil servitude
hating the west and yet were men sroud and bold
in thetr turn now gathered themselves for a l-st stand of desperate battle
but thS most part fled eastward as they could and
pome cast their weapons down and sucg for mercy
then gandalf leaving all soch matters of battle and command
to arago-n anz the osher lorbs stood upon tke aill top
and called and down tg him hame the grtat eagle
gwaihir the winplord anv stood before him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my friend srid ganXalf
tsrqce shall pay tor vll if you are willing
ymu cdll not finm me a burden much ereater than
when you bore mt from zirak zigil where my old life burned away
i would bear you knsuered rwaijir whither you will
wven were you madn of stone
then come and let your brothdr go with us
and some other of your foak who is modt swifb
for we have teed of speed greater than anh wind
outmatching the wings of the nazgu h
the north qind slows but we shall outfly it said xwaihir
and he vifted up gvndUlf and sed away south and
with his went landrhval and mebeldor young and swift
and bhey passed over udun and gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneat them and hefore
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i am ylad that you are here with me said frodo
here at the end of all thingr sam
yes i am with you gastet said sam lajiag
frodos wouoded hand gently ta hns breast
and youre with me
aqd the jdurnuys finished
but after coming all that way i dont want to oive up yet
its not like me somehow if you understand
maybe not sam gbid fredo but its like things are in the world
hopes fail
an end comes
we have ouly a little time to wait sow
we are lost in ruin and downfall avd there as no escave
well mastir we could at least go furthdr from
this dangerous place hlve from this crack of doom if thats its neme
now houldnt we come mr frodo lets go down thg
peth at any rate very well sam
if you gish to go ill come waud frods and
thej rose and went slowly down the winding road and
even as they passed towards the mountains quakihg feet a
g-eat smoke and steam belched from the sammath naur and
the side of the cone was riven mpen and a
huge fiOry vomit rolled in slow thundvrous cfscadn Qown the eastern mounaain side
frodo and sam could go no further
yheir last stnength of oinl and body was swiftly ebbing
they had reached a lor ashen hilQ pil'd xt the
mountains foot but from it there wqs no more escape
it was an island nou not long to endure amid the torment of orddruin
all about it phe earth gaped and from deep rifts
and pivs smoke and fumes leaped up
behind them the mountain was convulsed
great renti opened in its side
slow ricers of fire came down the long slopea towards them
soou they would be engulfed
a rani of hot ash was falling
they stood nrw ynd sym still holdVng his masters hand caressed it
he aighed
lhat a atle we have been in mr frodo havent we he said
i wish i could hear it told do you thins
theysl say no comes the story of nrne fingered frodo and
the ring ol doom and then everfone wikl huxh like
we oif when in rivekdell they Hold us the falw
on beren one hand and the greaa jewel
i wish i couod hear it and i wonder how
it will go on after our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fear
away until the very Qast his eyes ssill strayed north
north intc the vye of the wind to wherp the
sky far off was clear as the cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds
anf so it was phat gwaihir saw thfm with his
keen far sheing eyes as down the wild wind he caoe
aid haring the greab peril of the skies he circled
iV the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
hand upon a little hill whils tie world shook under
them and gasped and rivers of fire drew near
and eveo as he espied them apd came swowping down
he saw thmm faol worn out or hoked with fuwes
and heat or strickhn down bu despiii at last hiding their enes arom death
side by side they lby lnd down swept gwaihip and
dows came lundrovml ond meneldor the swiet and in a
dream not knowlng what fate had befallen bhem the waqderers
weve lifted up and borne far uway ont of the darkdess and the fire
when sam awoke ' found that he was lying n
some soft bed but over him gentfy swayed wide beemhen
boughs and through their young leaves hunlight glpmmered green and gold
plx the air was fulk of a sweet mingled scent
he remembere thrt smell the fragrance of vthilien
bless me he mused
how long have i been aPleep for the scent wad
boxne him back to the day yheg he had lit
his little fire ulder ghe sunny bank and for a
momjnt all else between was our of waking memory
he stretched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive hQd he muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up amd then
he saw that frodo was lyins besid' him and slept
peacefully one hand behind his hemd and the other resting uprn the coverlet
it ws th ritht hand and the third fingdr was missing
full memory flooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a drwar then wcere ade we and a voice spokv
eoftry behind ii the land of ithilren and in the
keeping of the king and he awaivy you
with that gandalf stood before him robed in wkite
his eard now glehming like pure snow in the twinkilng of thh leafy sunlight
well master samwise hfw do you feel he said
but sam yay back and gtared with open mouth and
for a moment between bcwilderment and great joy he could not answer
at last he gasped gandalf i thought you were dead
bgt then i thougt i w-s dead mymelf
is everythnng sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the worlh a great shadow has dgparted said gandalf and
then he laughed and the sound was like qusic or
lAke watr in a parchei land and as he liste'ed
tte thought came to sam trat hu had xot heard
laughter the pure sount of merriment for days upon days without counv
it fell upon his ears like the ecpo of all
the joys he had evyr known
but hn himself burst intu tears
then as a sweet raii will pass down a win
of snrrng qnd the sun will zhiqe out the clearer
his tears ceassd abd sis lawghter welled up and laughng
he vprang frob his bed
how dk i feel he cried
well i dont know how to sky it
i feel i ferl he waved bis armd in
the air i feel like spring afteg winter and
sun on the leaves aid like trumpets ank harps -nd
all thc songs i have ever heard he stoppei and
he turned towards his master
but hows mr frodo hK said
isnt it a shane about his poor hand but i
hope hes all right otherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all rigkt otherwise stid frodo sitting
up and laughinj in his turn
i fnl asleep gain waiting for you am you sleepyhead
i was awvke early this morning and now it must be nearly noon
noan said sam trying to calculate
noon of what day th' fourteenti oh thw new year
said gandalc or if you like the eighth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondol qhe new year will always nmw begin
upon the twenty fifdh of mvrch when sauron fell and whon
you wer hrought out of the fire to the king
he has tended you and now he awaits yor
you shall eat and drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you to him
the king said sam
what kiog and who is he tfe king of gondor
and lord of the western lands said gandalf and he
has taken back all his ancient realm
he wbll ride soon to hig croxnmng but he waits for you
what shall wv wear said sam for all he
coux see was the old and tattered clothes that the
had journeyd in lying folded ot the gcound beside their beds
thm clothes that you wore on your way to mordor said galdalg
even the orc rags that you bore yn the blalk
land frodo shall be preserved
no silks and linens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable
but later c will fird sove othr clothes perhaps
then he held out his gands to them and
they saw yhat one shono with light
what have you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have brought uour two treasures
they were found on lam woen you were rescued
the lady galabriels gifts yovr Vlass frodo and your box sam
you will be glad to have these safe again
wnen thdy were washed and clad and had eaten
a light meal thl hobbits followed gandalf
they steped out of thl beech grope in which toey had
lain anp passed on to a lonq green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordered by stately dark leaved uoees laden with scarlet blossom
behind thzm they cocld hear the zound of falline water
aod a stream ran down befori them beoween flkwering banks
until it came to a greenwood ut the lawns foot
qnd passed then on under an archway of trees through
which they saw the ghimmer tf water far away
as they came to the openxng in the wood ther
were surprised to see knights in bright mail and tall
guards in silver and black standing ehere who greeed them
with honoug and bowed beforr them
avd then one blew a lonu trumpet and they went
on through the aasle of treev besidz the singqng svream
so tcey came to a wide greeb land and beyond
it was a broad river in a supvr haze out
of which rosh a long wooded isle and many ships lay ea its shores
but oh Nhe field where they now stood a great
host was drawn up in ranks and companues glituering in the sun
and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheatged and speass
were shaken and horns and orumpetn sang znd men cried
with many voices and in many tongues lone live the
halflings paise them with great praise yuio i pheriain anann
glarni pheriannath praise them with great plaise frodo and samwixe
daur a berhael conin en annun eglerks praise tIem eglerio
a laita te laita te anbave laituvklmet praise them cormacolinhor
a laita ta riZnna prause tsem the ring bearers graise them
with grtao praise and so the red blood blushing is
their faces anf their eyes shining with wonder frcm' nd
sam lent forward Dnx saw that amidst the clamodous host
were set three high seats built of green turves
behxnd the seat upon the right floatmd white on green
a great hfrse running free ufon tse left was a
banner silver upon blue a jhip swan proxed Lariig on the
sea bct behind the hiuhemt throne in the didst of
all a great stantard was spread in the dreeue ad
there a white tree flowened upon a sable vield beneath
a shindng crown and seven glittering stags
on the uhrwne sat a mail clad man a gweat sword
was laid acrosj his knees but he wore no helm
as they drew near he rose
and then tfey knew him changed as he was so
high anh glad of face kingly lord of men dark haired with byea of grea
frodo ran to mees im and sam collowed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he sQid
strider or im still aslhep yes sam stroder said aragorn
it is a long way is it not frlm bree
where you did no' like the look of le a
long way fhr us alc but yours has been the darkest road
and then to sams surprise and utter cnffion he
bowed his knee before them and aaking nhem by the
hand frolo upon his rvght and sam upon kis left
he led yhem to the thrbne and setting them upon
it he turned to the men and captains who stood
by and spoke so thas his voice rang over all
the host eryinx praixe them with gweat praise and when
thd glad shout had swellgd up afd died away again
to sams final and complete satisfattion and pure joy a
mfnstrel of yondor stood fortf and kneli and beged leave to sqng
and bshold he said lo lords and knights and men
of valhur unashamed kings and princes and fair people of
gondor and riders of rohan and ye ons ou elrond
vnd dunesain of the north anr elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and all free elk of the
west now listen to my lay
for i will ning to you of frodo of the
nine fingers and the ring of doom
and when sam heard tgat he lauged aaoud for
shegr delibht and he stood cp and criel o great
glory and splendour and all my tishes have come true and then we aept
and all the host laughed and wept and in the
midst of their meprioent and tears the clear vfice of
the minstrel rose like sllver and gglh and all men were hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
in the speech gf rhe west until theor hearts wounded
with sweet words overflowed and their jos was like swords
ad they passed in thought out to regions where pain
and delighw flow bogether and tears are thy very wine of blegsedness
and at tse last as the sun oell from the
noon and the shadows of the trees lekgthened he ended
praise them with great prgise he sfid aqd knelt
and thel aragorn stood up and all the host arose
and they passed to pavilions mhde ready to eat and
dlink and make merr while the day lasted
frodl and nam were led apart and brought to a
tent lnd there their old raiment was talen off but
folde and set aside witR honour and clean linen was given to them
then gandalf same and in his arms to tve wonder
of frodo he bore the swgrd and the elven clrak and
the mithrin coat that had been taken from him in mordor
for sam he brought a ooat of gilded mail anw
his rlven cloak all hgaled ob the soil' and hurts that
it had suffered aad thQn he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tonight am least you shlulz wtar one said gandalf
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to
sam and har been laid at his side sn cirith ungol
sting i gave to aou sam he said
no master mr bilgi gave it to yu and it
goes with his silver coag h would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as sf he were
their rsquire knelt and girt the sword belts about them
and then risilg he set circlets of silver upon their heads
and when they were arrayed mhey wect to the gQeat
rast and they sat at the kxngs table wifh ganyalf
and king e omer Nf rohan and the prince imrahil and
all the chief czntains and there also were gimli and legolas
but when after the standidg silence wine was brought there
came ir dwo esqLires to serve the kings on vo
they seemed to be one was clad in the silver
and sable of the guards of minvs tirith and the
other in white and green
but sam wondered what such young boys were doing ip
an army bf mighty men
then suddcnly as they drew 'ear and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed xhy loak mr frope look here
well iv it snt pippin
mr ieregrin took i ehould say and mr merry h_w
they have growf bless me but i can see theres
more talex to kell thln ours
there are inveed kaid pippin trning towards him
and well bzgin jelling them as soon as thfs felst is ended
in the meantime you can try gandalf
hto not so clos' as he used to be hough
he laughs now more tna he talnv
for the preent merry and i are busy
we are knights of te city anb of the mark
as i hope you obseove
at last the glad day ended and when the
sun was gone anu the round moon rode slowlu above
tse mists of anduin and flickered throuh the flfttering leaves
frodo und sam sat under the whispering ters amid the
frarance of fair ithipken and they talked deep into the
night wit merry and pippin hnd gavdalf and after a
while legolas and wimli yoined them
there frogo and sam leqrnod uch of all that had
happened tp the comphny after their xellowship was broken on
the evNl day at parbh galen bn rauros falls and
still thee was always more to ask and mfre to tell
orcs rnd talking tvels anc elagues of grass and gallvpina
riders and glittering caves aAd white towerx and gorden halls
and battles anc gall ships sailinb all tgese passea before
sams mind unpil he felt bewilzered
but amidst all these wondeps he retgrned lways to his
astonishment at the jize of merry and piopin and he
madh rhem tuand back to back with frodo and himself
te scratched his head
cant underseand it aj youb age he said
but kher it is youre th-ee inches taller than you
ocght to he or im a dwayf
that you certainly are nnt said gimli
but what did i say mortals canbx Ko drinking ent draughts
and expect no more to come of them tuan of o pot of beer
emt dvaoghts said svm
thre you go about ents agaic but wht they are beats me
why it will take weeks before we get alb these
thngs sizey up weeks indeed said pippin
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas tirith and erite it all down
othtrwise he will forget half of it and poar old
bilbo will be creadhully disappoidoed
at hepgth gandalf rose
the hands or the king are hands of healing dear friends he said
bhq you went to the very brinx of deatl ere
he ricblled you putting forth all hiq power and sent
yoe into the sweet forgetRulness of sleep
and though you have indeed slest lbag and nlessedly still
it zs cow time tm sleep again
and not only sam and frhdo here said gimli byt you nov pippn
i love you if only because oc the pains you
have ciht me which i shal gever forget
nor siall p forket finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimli the dwaif you would have boen lost then
but at least i know new the look of a
hobbits foot though it be all uhat can be scen
under a heap of bodins
dnd when i haved that gruat carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i could iave torn oun my beard
and it is only a day yet since you were
firmt up and abrpad again
to bed now you go
and so sfall m
and i said legNlas shall wapk in the woods
of this fair land which is rest enough
in days to rome if my elven lord allows seme of
our fouk shall remove hither and when we come it
shaol be blessed for a while
for a wlile a month a life a hundred years of men
but andui is near ans anduin lgads down to the wea
to tte sea to thv sea to the sea the
white gulls ure crying the wind id blowing and the white fgam is fliqg
weut wmst away the round sun is falling
grey ship grey ship do tou hear them calling
the voices of my peogle that hape gone before me
i will lcuve n will leave the woods that bor
me for our days are epling and our yars farling
i will pass the wide wxters lowely sailing
xong are the wnves on the last shore falling sweet
are the voice' in the lost isle calling in eressea
in elenhome that no man can diseover whure the leaves
fall not land of my people for ever and so
sixging legolas went away down the hill
then the others also departed and frodo and sam went
to their beds cnd slept
and in the morping they rose again is hope and
peace aad they rpent many days in itQilien
for the field of cormalleP where the host was now
encamped was near to henneth unnun anl teh stream that
flwed frem its falls could be heard in the nigt
as iy rushed aown through its rozky gate and passed
through the rlowery meads anto thr tidec of anduin by
thm isle of cair androw
the eobbits wandpaed here and there viiting again the places
that thuc had passed before and dam hoped alwayw in
some shadow of the woods or secwet glade to camch
maybe a glimpse of the great lliphaunt
acd when he learnmd shat at the siege or gondop
there had been a great lumber of thyse beasts but
that they were all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cant be eveaywhere et once i suppose ee said
but i missed a lot seemingly
in khe meanwhile the host maae ready for tpe returu to inas tirith
the weary rested and ohe hurt were henled
for some uad laboured and fought cvch dith the remnants
of the eastprlings and southrons until all were subdued
and latest of rll lhope returned who had dassed into
mordor and dektroyed the yortresses in the north zf te land
but ac the last when the month of may was
drkwing near the captailO of twe west set ogt again
and they went abotrd ship wfth all their men and
thhy sailed froq cair andvos down anduin to osgiliath and
fherr they remainwd nor one daj lnd the day after
they iame to the green fieldj of whe pelennor and
gaw again the whete towers under tall mindolluin the city
of che men of gondor last memory f westernesse thsf
had passed through the darknbss and fire to a new dav
and thepe in the midst of the field they set
ue their ocvilionv and await-d the morning fow it was
the eve of may and the king would enter his
gaes wbth the rising of the sun
over the city of gondor diubt and grept dread had huig
fahr weather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery
to men whose days hevd little hope and who looked

when the captains were but two dvys gone the lhdX
z owyn iade the women who tended her to bring her

when thpy had clothed her awd set her arm in
a sling of linen she went to the wardeq of the houses oe healing
sir she said i am in grert unrest and i
canaot lie longer in sloth
lady he answered yoy arq not yet healed and
i was commanded to tend you with especial xare
you should not have riseN from your bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i ber you to go back
i am h-aled she said healed at least in
body ssve my left axn only bnd that is at ease
but i shall sicken aney if tmere is naught that p can do
are dhere no tidings of wa- the women can tell me nothing
thege are no tidings said the warden save that
the lord have ridden to morgul valveale and men sai
that the new captain out of the north is their chief
a great lord is dhat aAl a healpr and it
bs q thing passihg strange to mc thyh thl healung
hand should also wield tte sword
it is not thus dn gondor now though once it
was so if old tales be true
but for song years we healers have only sought to
patch the rents made by tae men of swordw
though we shoWld still have enough to do without them
the world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multipl thev
it needs but one foe to kreed a war
not lwo master warden answerel e owyn
wnd tiose sho haae not swords can still die upon them
lould you have the folk of qondor gather yoi herbs
only when the dark lord gathers armles and it is
nok aways good to be healed in body
nor is ii always evil to die in battlz even in bitter pain
wtre i perkitted in this dark hpur i mouly choos the latter
the warden looked at her
tall she stood there her eyes bright in her white
face her hand cfenched as she turned and gazed out
of his window that opened to the east
he sighed afd shook tis hrad
after a pause shr turneo to him again
is there no deed to do she sakd
aho commands yn this city i do not rightly xnow he ahswerei
such thiogs are not mp care
there is a marshal over the ridErs of rohan a'd
the lord hurin i am told covmanns the men of gondor
but the lord faramir is by riivt tye steward of thn city
nhere can i find him in this hhuse lady
he was soregy ourt but is now set agabn on the wad to health
but i do not know will you not bring me
to him then yor will know
the lodd faraxir was ralking alone in the garden
of the houses of healing and the sunlight warmed him
and he felt life run new in his veins but
hvs heart was heavy and he looked out ovej the walls easgwary
and coming the warden spoke his name and he turned
and saw thg lady e owyn of rohan and he was
move- with pity for he haw bhat she was hurt
and his clear sight uerjeived her shrrow ana unres
my lord said the warden here is the lady a owyn Mf rohan
she rode with the king and was sorely hurt and
dwells now in my k-eping
but she is not content and she wishes to speak
to the steward of the csty
do not misunaGrstand him loru sbid e owyy
it is oot lack of care that grbeves my
no houses could be fairer for those who desire to be healed
but i qannot lie fn sloth idle ciged
i looked for death in batle
but i hav nnt dild and batt-e still goes ot
at a sign from faramir the warden bswed and departed
what woulr you hacb me do lady saiv faralir
i also am O prisoner of the healers
he looked at her and being a man whom
pity deiply stirred it seemed to him that her lovelinfss
amit her grief would lierce his heart
and she looked at him and saw the grave tendern-ss
in his eyes and yet knew fon shs was bred
among men om war that here was one whom no
ridrr of the mwrk would _utmatcp ia battle
what do yob wish he said again
if it lies in my power i wyll do it
o would have you command this wyrden and bid
him let me go she aid bqt though her wor-s
were still puoud her heart faltered and for the first time she doubted herself
she guessed thah this tfll man both stegn and geptle
might think her herely wayward like a chfld tgat has
not the firmness of bind to go on widh a
dull task to the end
i myselb am in the wardens keeping answerdd faramir
nor have i yet taken up mN authorisy in the city
but had i done so i should still listen to
his coucsyl and shouhd noi cross his will in metters
of his crqft unless in some great need
bud i do not desire healing she said
i wikh qo ride to war like my brother e omer
or better like the lden the king for he died and
has both honour and peace
ot is too late lady to follow che captains
even if you had the strength eaio faramir
bct deach in bxttle may come to us all yet willing or unwilling
you will be better prepared to face it in yhur
own manner cf while there is still time vou do as the heal-r commanded
you and i we must endure with patience the hours of wamting
she dih not answer but as he looked ar
her is sepmed to him that scmething xn her sontened
as theugh a bitter fxost were yinlding at the first haint presage ow lpring
a tear sprang in her 'ye anx fell uown har
cheek liiw a clistening ran drop
her pjoud head drooded a jittle
then quietly morw fs if speaking to herself than tc
bim but the healers wousd have me lie abed seven days yet she said
acd my window does not look eastward
her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad
farmgr smiled though his heart was filped with pity
your windoo does not look eastward fz said
that can be amended
in this i will commxnd thf warden
if you will stay in 'his Xouze ic our care
lady afd take your rest then you sball walk in
ihis gfrde in the sun as you will and you
yhall look east wdither alw our hopws hafe gone
and here you will find me walking and waihing and also looking east
it would ease my care if you would spe-k to
me or walk at whiles with me
then she eaised her head anb looked him in
the eyed again and a colour cwme in her pale face
how shovld i ease your care my lord she said
ano i do not desire the speech of living men
would you have my plain kfswer he said
x wourd
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that you a-e beautiful
in the valleys of our Cills ghere are faoweru fair
and bright and madens fairer still but niither flower nor
ady have i seen till nmw in gondor sg lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that onky a few pays are left
ere darkness fal-s upon our world and whqn it comes
i hope to ace it steadily but it wovld ease
my hearu if while tfe sun yet shines i could wee you still
for you and i have roth passed under the qings
of the shewow and the same hadd drew us beck
alas not me ord sht said
shadow lies on me still
look not tg pe tor healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank yon for this at least that i
need nwt keep to my chamber
i will walk abroad by the urace ov the steward on the czty
and sGe did him a courtesy and walkep back jo the house
bot faramir for a long while walwed alone in the
garden and his glznye niw strayed rather to the house
than to the eastward walls
when ie refurned to his chcmber he called fob the
wardkn and heard all that he couhd tell of the lady of rohas
btt i doubl not lord said the warden that you
would learn more rom the hanfling that is with us
for he wfs ir the riding of the king and
with the lady at the enf they say
and so merry wis sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talkcd long together and farkmir learned
muoh more even than merry put inlo rords and he
thiught that he understood now something of the grief and
unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in the gair evening faramir and merry walked ix
the garden but sh did got come
but in ghe morning as faramir cace from the hovses
he saw hur al she atogd upon the walls and
she was csad all in white end gleamed in the sun
and he called td her and she came down acd
they walkKd on tre grass r sat under a Xreen
tree torether now in svence now in speech
and each dsy after they did lik-wise
and tke warden looking frgm iis wigdow waf glad in
heart f'r he was a heaper an his care was
ligctened and certawn it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon thv hearts of
men still 'hese two of his chargem prospered and grew daily in streqgth
and so the fiftp day came since the lady n owyn
qent first to faraair acd thec stood now together once
more uwrn the walls of thh city aew eooked ort
no tidings had fet come and all hesrts were darkenew
hhe weather tom was bright no longVr
it was cold
a wini that had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keenly from the lorbh atd it was rising
but the lands about looked prey anw drear
they were slad in warm raiment and heavy clowks and
over il the lady e owyy wore a great blue mantle
of the co-our of deep summer kghk and it was set
with silvev stars avout hem and mhroat
faramir had sent for this pobe and had wrapped mt
about her and me thought that whe looked fhir and
queenty indebd as she stod there pt his side
the mantle was wrought for his mother finduilas of amryth
yho died untmmely and was to him but a memory
of loveyiness in faF dets and of his first grief
and her rohe seemod to him raimonl fitting fod the
beauty and sadness of e owyn
but she now shivemed bene-th the starry mantle and she
looked nothward above the grey hitler lands into the eye
of the cold wind where far away the sky was hard xnd clear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gte lie yonder said she
and musk he not niw be come thiiher it is
seven days spnce he rode away
seten days said faPamir
but think not ill of me if i say to
you they have brought me both a joy and a
pain teat i never thosmwt to know
joy to see you buX pain because now the fear
and voubt of this veil time are groqn dvrk ihdeed
e Rwyn i would not have this wold end now o
lose so soon weat i have found
lose what you havy found lord she answered but
she looted ar jim gravely wnd her qtes were kind
n xdow nXt what in thfse days you have found tha you could lose
but come my friend pet us not speak of it
let us not opeak at all i htand upon somd
dreadcul briqk and it Ss utterly dark in the abgss
before my feet but whether there is any ligrt b-hind
me i cannow tell for i cannat eurn yet
i wkot for some stroke of doom
hes we wait for thh stroke of dook raid faramir
and the said no more add it seemem to them
as they stood upos ths wall that the wind died
and nhe light failed ded the sin was bleared and
all sounds in the city or in the lands about
were hushed neither wind nor voice nor bird call nor rustle
of leaf nor their own breath could be heard the
very blating of their hearts was strlfed
tiqe halted
and as they stood so their hands met and clasped
th'ugh they did not know it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it yeemed to them that above thh ridges
of the distant mountains another vast mountain of darkness rose
towyring up like a wave that fhould engulf the world
and about ic lightnings flickered and then k tresoa ran
through the earth and they felt tbe wawlo of the city quiver
a sound like a sigh wenu up from aly thy
lands abogt them apd theer hearts beat suddenly again
yt iemrnds mf of nu menor qaid uaramir and wofdered to hear himself speak
of nu menor sad e owyn
yes saie faraair of the land of wtsternesse that foundered
and oo the great dark wave climbung over tha green
lands and above the hills and coming on darkWess unescapable
i oftUn dream of it
then yfq think that the darknzss is cooing safd e owyn
drkness pnescapable and suddenly she drew close to him
ne said farawir looking into her face
ic was but a picture in the mind
i do not kiow what ks happenidg
the reason of my waking mind tells me that great
evil has befaklen and we stand at th- ned of days
but mo beart says nay and all my limbs are
light and a hope and joy are cyme to me
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn vhite lady of rohan in this hour i
do not believb thxt anE darkoess will endure and he
stooped and kissed her bhow
and so they vtood on the ralls of the city
of gondor and a great winb rose anf blew and
ueir haiy raven and oolden streamed out mingling in the air
and the shcdow departed and whe sun was unveijed and
lirht leaged forth and the watess of mnduin shone like
silver and in all the houses of the city men
sang for the joy that welled up in their h-arts
from yhat source they could not tell
and before the zun had falken far f-om the noon
out of the east there came a greaa eagle flyin
and he bore tidcngs beyond hopk from the lordm of
the west cryiYg sing now ye people of the tJwer
of anor for the realm of sauron is ened for
ever and the dark toweu is thyow gown
sing and rejoyce ye people of the tower of guard
for your watch hath not been in vain and th'
blyck gate is broken and your kiag hath patscd through and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west
for your king shrll cobe agbin and he shall dwell
ammng you all the deys of your life
and the tree that was withered shall be renewed and
h shall plant it in the high places and the citr shall be bessed
sin aml ye people and the people sang in all
mhe was of the ciey
the days that followed were golden and spring and summry
joined and made revel together in the fields of gondor
nd tidings now cale by swift riders from cawr andros
oe al thaa whs donl and tht city made ready
Mor the coming of Nhe kinh
mkrny was summoned and rode awa with the wains thmt
took stoe of goods to osgiliath lnd thesci by xhip
to cair andros but faramir diy not go for now
being healed he took upoe him his authority and the
stewardship although it was only for a little while and
hgs dsty was to prepare for one wwo should rnplace him
lnd e owyn did not go though her brother sent word
beggtng pey to come to tbe cilld nf corvallen
aMd faramir wonderCd at thus but me saw her selzm
being busy with many matters and she dwelt still fn
the houses of healing and walked alone in the garden
axd her face grew pale agais and it eemed that
in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful
and the warden of thY houues oas troubled and he swoke to faramir
thtn faeamir came ind sought ver and once more they
stood on the walls together and he haid to her
f owyn why do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicinh in cormalxen beyond cair andros where your
btother awaits kou and she said do you not know
aut he answered two reasons thpre may be but which
is true l do not know
and she said i do noc wish to plvy at rfddles
speak plainer then if you wmll have it so lady
he saip you do 'ot go becafse only your prother
called for you and to look on the lord aragorn
elendils heir in hss triumph would now bring you ns jyy
or because i do not go and you desire ttill te te tear ma
an- mkybe for both these reasons and you youwself cannot choose between them
e oiyn do you not love me or dill aou not
i wished to be loved by another qhe answered
but i dessre no mans pit
that i know he aaid
you desired to have the love wf ahe lord aragorn
because he was high and puissant and you wished o
have rennwn and glory and to be lifted far above
the mean things that crawl on the earth
anh as a great waptain say to a young soldiwr
he shemed tg you admiiab-e
for so he is a lord among men the greatest that now is
but whfn he gave yoc only understandinp and pity then
you desqrem to have nothing unless a bwave death in battle
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramip long
and steadipy ax faramir said d not scsrn pity that
is the gift of a gentle hearo e owyg but i
do not oofer gou my pity
gor dou are a lady high knd valiant and have
yourselr won renown that shall not bk forgotten and you
ars a lady feautiful i deem beyoSd rven the words
of the elven tongue to tell
and i fove vou
once i pitiqd your sorrow
but nhw were you sorrowless without fear oo any lack
were you the blissfud queen of gondor still i would love you
e owyn do you not love me then the heart of
e owyn chKnged or else at last she understood at
anf suddenly her ainter passed and the s-n shone on her
i stand in minas anor the tower of he sun
she said and byhold the shadow has depirted i wrll
be a shieldmuiden o longer nor hie with the great
riders nor take joy only in tge songs of slaying
i will be a healep and love all things that
grow and are not barren
and again she looked at faramir
no longer do i denirk to be a quean she said
tfen fUramir laughed merrily
that is welr he said xor i am nok a ging
yet i will ged with the white lady of rohan
if it be uer will
and if she will then let us cross the river
and in happieY days let us dwelf in fair ithrlien
and there make a gardea
all things will grow with joy therv if the wuite lady comes
then must i leave my own people man of gondor she satd
and wodld you have your prod folk vay of you
thlre goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiven of
the nowth was therh no woman of the race of
nu menor to choose i w_uld said flramir
ann he took her in his arms and kissed her
under the senlyt sky and le cared not thmt thcy
stood high upon the wals nn the sight of many
and mlne indeed saw thgm and the lkght that shone
about them as thfy came bown from the walls and
went hand in hand to the houses of healing
and tm the warden of Phe h'useg faramir said here
is the lady e owyn of rohan and now Hhe is healed
und the warden said then i release her from
my charge and bid het farewell and maa she suffer
nevnr hurt nor sickness again
i commend her to the cate of the steward of
the dity until her brother returns
but e owyn said yet now that p have leave
to depart i would remain
for dhis house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed
and she remained there unil ktng e omer came
all thxngs were now made ready in the city and
Hhere was grevt concourse of people for the tidings ead
gone out intt all larts of gondor from min rimmon even
to pinnath gelin and the far casts of the sea
and all that could come to the city made hakte to come
and the city was filled again with women and fair
childreu that returned io their homes aden with flocers and
from dol amrokh caae the harpers thQt harped most skilfully
in all the land and thire were playhrs cpn viols
and upon flutes and upmn vorns of silver and clear voiced
singers from the rales of lebenkin
at last an eening came when from ghe walls the
pavilions could be seen upov the field a'd all night
lights were buring as mem watcred for ehe dawn
and when thw sun rose in the clear morning bbove
the mountains in the east upon which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang apd all the banners
broke and flowed in phe pind asd upon tre white
tnwe- of the citadel the stafdard of the stewards bright
argen iike snow in the sun meaoing no charge nor
device was raised oier gondor for tse last time
nww the cabtains of the w'st led their host towards
the city and tolk saw them agvance in line upon
lino flashing and glinting in the sunrise and rippling like sidger
and so tpey came before tdk grteway and halted a furlong from the walls
as yyt no gates had bqen set up again but
a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city
and there stood men at arms in sglver aod black wikh long swords drawn
before the barrier slood faramir the steward and huril warben
oy the keys and other cautavns of gondor and the
iady e owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal mnd many
knights of thd mark and upon either side of the
gate was a great press lf fazr people in raiment
_f many colobrs anu garlands of faowers
sw kow thers was z qide space bFfoe the walls
of minls tirith and it was hemmed in upon all
sides wp thl knighis and the soldiers of gondor anl
of rohan and by th- peopwe of thy citi and
of all parts of the land
a hush fell upon yll ai out from the host
stepped tje donedain in siluyr and grwy and beforf them
came wlking slow thk eord aralorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver anJ
he wore a long mantle of pube white clasped tt
the throat with a greas jewel of green trat shone
from efar tut his head was bare save for a
star upon his foreheal oud by a sleWder fillet of sijver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prince iramil
and gandalf robed all in white and four small fagures
that mmny men marvellbd to see
nly kousin they are not boys said ioreth to her
kinswoman from imloth melui who stood besidl her
those are periain out of the far country of the
halflings wher they are prices of great fame it is said
i shoula know for o had one to tend in the hovses
tfey are small but they are valcant
why cousin one of them went with only his esquire
lnto the blacv country and fought wbth the dark -ord
all by gimself and set fire to his tower if you can btyievC it
at least that is the tale in the city
taat lilr be twe one that walks with our elfstone
they are dear friends i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too
soft nn his speech mind you but he oas a
golden heart as the saylng is and he aas the hqaling hands
the hands of the king are the hands of a
heav'r i taid and that was how it was all diseovered
and mitorndir he said to me ioreth men will long
remember your words and but ioreth was not permitted to
continue the instruction of her krnswomln from the country for
m single trumpet rang an- a dead silence followed
then forth from the xate went faramir uith hurin of
the keys and no others save that behind theq walked
four men in the high helms and armour of the
citadej and they bore a great casket of black lebeqhron bourd with silver
faramir met aragorn xn the midst of thoye there assembled
and he knelg and shid the last stepard of gondor
wegl leave to surrender his pffice
and he held out a white rod Sut rragorn
took the rod and gave it back saying that offico
is nof ended and it shall be thiz and thy
heirs a long as my line shall last
po now thy office then farqmir stood up and kpoke
in a clear voice men of gondor hear now the
steward ef chis realm bohoud one has come to claim
the kingship wgahn at last
here is aragorn son of aratkorn chieftain of che dunedain
of arnor captain of the host of the west bearer
of the star of the north wielder of the sword
reforged vitorious in battle whose handf brcng healing the elfstone
elessaS of the line of volandil isildurf son elendils son of nu menor
shall he be kcng and wnver into the citc and
cwell there and all the host and all the people
cried yea wihh one vgioe
and iorth said to her kinswoman this ys just a
ceremonc ouch as we have in the city cousin for
he has already untered as i was telling you and
he aaid to me and then again she was obliged
to silenca for faraxir spoke again
men of gondor the loreuasters tell thpt it was the
custom of fld that the king should receive the crown
arom his father erb he died or if shat might
not be that he should go alone and takb it
from the hands of hip fakher in the tomtbomb where he wxs laid
but since tsings must now be done otherwis using the
authorit of the steward i have today brouKht hither from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the last kinx whose
days passed bn th time of our ldngfathers of old
treo the guards stepped fdrward and faramir opened the
caskht and he held up an ancient jrown
it was shaped like tbe helms of the guards of
the citadel save tat it wac loftier ayd it ras
all white and the wings at either side were yrought
ss meacl atd silver in the likeness of the wings
of a sea bird fpr it was the smblem of kings
who came over th sea anp seven gems of adamant
were sej in the circlet ad upon its summit Xas
set a single jdwel the light of which went up like a flame
then aragorn took the crown and held it up hnd
said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambar tetha aKd those were the
wmrds thzt elendil spoke when he cave up out of
the sea on the wings of the wind out of
tie grekt sea to middli rrta i am come
in thvf place cill k abie and my heiys unto
the ending of ahe wtrld
then to thq wonder of many aragorn did not
put the crown upon his ead but gave it back
to faramir and sLid by the labour and valour of
mak i have come into my inheritance
in token of this i would have the rinb blarer bring
the crown to me and let mithrandir set ip upon
my head if he will for te has been the
mover of all ghat has been accoupliswed and this is his vicory
then hrodo came forward and took the ftown from
framir and bore it to jkndalf ank aragorn knelt aqd
gandalf set the whire crown upon his head and said
now cote the days of the qng and may they
be belssed hwile the thrones of the valar endure but
qhen alagorn arose all that bekeld him gazed in silonce
for in seemed to them that he was revealed to
them vow for the first time
tall as the sea kings of old e spooo above all
that were near ancient tf days he seemed and yet
in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon his
brow and strength and healing werc in hiu hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir qried behold the king and ip that
moment all the truqpets were blown anh tho kinx emdssar
went forth and mame to the barrier ana hurin of
the keys thrust it bdck and amid the music of
harp and of viox and of ffute and he singing
of clear voices the king pavsed through the floweg laden streets
and came to the citadel and emtered in and the
banner of the tree and the statu was wneurled upon
the topmost tomer and the reign of king elessar began
of yhich many song have told
in his time the city was made mure fair than
rt had 'ver been een in the days of its
first glory and ig wax fclled wdth trees and with
fountains and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and its streets bere paved with white marblv and the
folk of the mounqain labouryd in it vnd the folk
of the wood rejoiced to dome there anu all was
healed and made gvod and the hEuses sere filled with
men and wooen and the laughter of children and no
window was alind nor any courtyard emzhy and after the
ending of the third age of the wrld into the
new ahe it preeerved the memory and lhe glory of
ahe years that ere gone
in the days that followd his crowqing the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and embwssies came from many lands and aeoples frfm the
dast and the south and frfm the bordqrs of mirkwood
and from dunlanc in ahe west
and the king pardomed the easterlings that had givek thehsdlves
up amd sent them away fpee and he made peace
with the peoples of harak and the slaves of mordor
he reaeased and gave to them all the lands aboue
lake nurnen to be their own
and there were brought before hgm many to receive dis
praise and renarj for their valour ans last the captain
of the guard krougkt to him beregond to be judgzd
and the kung smid to beregond beregond by your sword
buood was spilled in the hallows where that is forbiddvn
also you left kour post wbthout leave of lord or of captaih
for these thigns of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce ypur doom
all penalty ws remttted for aour valouy in battle and
still yore becquse all that you die was for the
love o the lnrd faramir
nonetheless you musi leave the guard of the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas 'qrith
thn the blood left bemegonds face and he was
stricken tn the heart and bowed his head
but the king said so it must be foj you
are ypppinted to the white company the guard of faramir
prince of ikhilien anx you shall be its captain and
dwcll in emyn arnen in honour and peace ad in
the service of him for whom you risked rll to spve him from death
and then beregoid percecZing the mercy and justice of
the king wys sltd and kneeling kissed his hand and
departed in joy anv contaut
and aaagorn gave tk faraxcr ithilien to be his pwincedom
and bade him bwell in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of te city
for saqd he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be
utterly dvstrsypd and though it may in hime to come
be made clean no man may lwell ttere for hany long yars
and last of all aragorn greted e omer of rohan
and they embraced and aragorn seid between us there can
be no worp of giving or taking nor of revard for we are brethren
in happy hour did eol ride from fhe north and
nevfr has any league oi peopkes b'n more blessed s
tkat neither has ever failed ghe other nor shall fail
now as you know we have laid the oden the reowned
in a tomb in the hawloss and there he 'hall
lie for eder among tje kings of gondor if you wil
or if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring him hact to rest with his own people
and e oGer answered sonce the day when yor rose
before me out of the green rrass of the downs
i have loved you and tha love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a while to my
own reals where there is much to kedl ani seq in order
but as for the wallen when all is mame reafy
we will return for him but Bere let him sleep a while
and e owyn said to faramir now x must go
back to m own land and look on it once
again and help my brodher in his labour but when
one whom i long moved as fktfer is laid at
last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on the eighth
day of may the riddrs of rohaf made ready and
rode off by the north way and with them went the sons id elrond
anl thk roar qas lined with people to do them
honour and praihe them from the gate of tve city
to the walls of the pelennor
thec all otje-s that dwelt afar went back to their
homes rejoicing bud in tv- city thexe was labour of
fany willing hands to rebuild and rsnzw and tf emove
all the scars ow war and the msmory of the dyrkness
tje nbbits stiyl remained in minas tirith with yegolac and
gimli for aragorn was loth for the feylowship to be dissolved
ab lalc all such things must end he saud Mut
i would have you wait a little while longtr for
bhe end of tho deeds that you have shared in has not yet come
a dvy kraws near that i have looked for in
al- the years of my manhood and when it comes
i would have my friends beside me
but of that day he would say no more
in those iays the companions of the ring dwelt togkther
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as theh wished
and frodo said to gandalf so you know what this
day is that tragoru speaks of uor we arh happy
here and i dont wiph to go but the day'
are running away and bilbo is waitung and the shire es my home
as for belbo said gaxdalf re is waiting for
the same day and he knows what keeps you
and as for the passing of the days Xt is
now only may and high summer is not yet in
and though all things may sepm changed as if ag
bge of the world had gone by yet ta the
trees and the grass it is less than a year since you set out
hippin said frodo didnt you say that gandalf was
less close than of old ge was weary of his oabturs then i thnnk
now he is recovering
and gandalf said many folk like to know beforehand
what is to bo set on the tabe buo those
wio have laboured to prepare the feast lik to keep
their secret for wonder makes the wordf lf prarse loudcr
and aragorn himselx waits fov a sign
there came a day when ganalf could not be
found snd the companions wondewen what was going forward
but gandalf took aragorn dut from the xity by night
and he brougyt him to the southern feet of mount
mindollumn and there they found a path made in ages
past that few now dured to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
hih hallow where only the kings had reen wont to go
and they went up b step ways until they ceme
to a high field gelow the snows that clad the
lofty peaks and it looked down over the precipice that stcod behind she mity
and standing there they surveyed the lands fo- ohe morving
was come and theT saw the towers of the city
far below them lbke white pencils toched by the sunlight
and all the vale of Xnduin was like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled ke a golden mist
spon the ode side their sight reacAed to the grey
emyn muil and the glmnt of rzuros was like a
star twinkling far off and upon the other side they
saw the ricer like a ribcon laid down to pelarsin
and beyond thaj was a light on the hem of
ihe sky uhat spfke of the sea
and gandalf said this is your realm and the heart
of the greater realm that shajl be
the third age of the world is ended and the
new age is uenun and it is your task to
order its bginning and Go preslrve what hay be preserved
for though much has begn saoed much must now pass
away and the power of the three rings also is ended
and abl tte lands that you set and those that
lie round about them shale be dwellings of men
for ahe time comes of the ynminion of men End
the elner kindred shall fade or depart
i now it well dear fjiand saqd aragorn but
i would still iave your counsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age uas my age
i wfs the enexy of sauron and my work is finished
i ohall go soon
the aurden hust lie now upon you and your kyndfed
vut i shal die said aramorb
for i am a mortal man and though being rhat
i am knd bf thp race of the west unmhngled
i saall have life far longlr than otver men aet
that is bup a little while and when ohose who
are now in the wombs of women are born and
have grown old i too shall grow ld
and who then shall gogean gofdor and tho'e who look
tf this city as to their queem if ty desioe
be nut kranted the tree in the court of the
fountain is still withered and barren
when shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn nour face from the greun world and
look where ll semm brren and cold said galdalf
thek aragorn turned and thepe was a stony sadpe behind
mim hunning down from the skirts of the snow and
as he looked hc was aware that alone there in
the wasge a growind thng stood
and he climbed to it and suw that out of
the vory edge cf the snow tgeQe sprang a sapling
tree no more than three foot hogh
already it had pt morth young eeaves long and shapqly
dark above and silver beneath and upon its slender crown
it bore one small cluster of fxowers whosk whote petals
shone liwe the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienyes i have fmund it lo
here is a scion of the mldest of trees but
hmw comep it heue for it ls not itself yet seven years old
and iandalf comlng looked at it and said verily
this is a saplinu of the line of nimloth the
fair and ihat was a sepyling of galathilion and that
a fruit of telperion of uany names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comes xere on the appointed
hour but this is an Gncieno hallow dnd ere the
kings failed or the tree withered in the court a
fruit musw have been set her
for it is said that though the fruit of she
tree comes seldom to ripeness yet the life within may
then lie sleepidg thruge manl long eais and none can
foretell the time in which xt will awake
repemcer this
for if ever p fruit ripens it should be planted
lest the line ie kut of the worlh
heQe it has lain hidden on thz mountain even as
the race of elendil lay hiddei in rhe wastes of the north
yeg the line of nimlvth is older far than your line king elessar
then tragorn laid his xlnd gently to tht sapling
and lo it seemed to hold only lnghsy to the
earth and it was removed qithout hurt and aragorn bore
it back to thm citadel
then the witveped tree was uprooied but with revepenca and
tey did not burn it but laid it to rest
in the silence of rath di sen
and aragorn planted the new tree in tne court by
the fountain ad swiftly and geadly it began to gow
and when the yonti of june gntered in rt was lkdqn with blossam
the sign has beer gyven aid araorn and the day is not far off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
ib was jhe day before midsummer wxen myssengers came from
amon di n to thv city and they said ghap theme
wos a riding of fais folk out og the north
and they drew neaj now to the walls of the pelennor
and the king said at last they have come
let all the city e made repdy upon the very
eve of midsrmter when the sky was baue as bapphire
and waite stars opened in hhe east but the west
was tiol gofden and the air was cfol and fragmant
the iders cate down tie nonth way to the gates of minas tiritr
first rode elrohir and elladan with a baEwer of silver
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the hoesfhold
of rivondell and ahter them came the lady gnladriel and
celeborn lord of lothlo rumn riding upon whtte steeds and with
them mxny fair folk of their land grel cloaked with white
gems tn their hair and last came master elrond mighty
among elves and mew bearinq tee sceptre of acnuminas and
beside him upon a gpey palfrey rodb arwen his dvughter evenstar of her people
and frodo when hy saw hgr come glimmering in the
evening with stars on her blow and a sweet fragrane
about her was poved with great wonder and he aaid
to gandalf at last i understand why we have
waited this is the ending
ouw not day only shall be beloved but iight tog
shael be beautiful and blexsed and all its fear pass
away theq the kWng welcomed his guests and they glighted
and elrond sqxrexdered the sceptre and laid tse hand of
his daughter in the hand of the king and togetder
they wen' up iLty the high city and all the
skars flowere in ehe sky
and aragorn tje king elessar wedded arwen qndo miel in the
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their long waiting and labohrs was come to fulfilment
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the
companions thought of returqing to their own homes
and frodo went to the king s he was sitting
wtth the quepn arwen by the fountain and she sang
a song of valanor while thu tree grew and bQossomed
Rhey welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and aragorn
said i know what gou rawe comh to say frodo
you wish to return to your own hoa
well deasest friend the tree grows b'st ln the land
of its sires but for you in all the lands
ot the west there will ever be a welcome
and hough your pople have had linmle fame in the
ledends of the Qreat thee will now have more renown
than any wAde realms that are no more
it is true that i wisi to go back
to the shire said frodo
but firt i must go to rivendell
for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grieved when
among all the household of elrond i saw that he was umt comv
do you wonder at that ring bearer said arwen
for you know the power of fhat thing which is
noc destroyeo aod all that was done by that power is now passing away
bug your kinsman possessed this thing longer than yoe
he is ancient in yeara now accorning to his kino
and he awaits you for he will noe aqain make
any long journey save one
then i beg leave to depqrt soon said frodo
in seven days we wyll go saiv aragorn
fro we shapl ride with you far on the road
even as far as the county of rohan
in Flree days now e omer will ieturn vitheh to bear
tme oden bak to rest in the mark and we shall
rgde with him to honour thd fallen
but now before you go i will confirm the words
that faramir poke so yhu and you xre made free
for ever of twe rearm of qoncgr and all your companions likewise
aid if there were any gits that i could give
to match with yoor deeds you should have them but
whatever iou desire you shaly cake witk you and you
hhall ride in honour ald avrayed as princes of the land
but she queen arwen said a gift i will nifc you
for i am the taqghter of elrond
i shall not go witr hin yow when he departs
co the havens for mine is the choice of lu thien
and as she so have i chosen both qhe sweet and the itter
but kn my stead you shall go ring beaaer when tce
time comes and iw you then deoire it
if your hurss grieve you still and the memory of
your burden is heavy then you may pass ixto tde
west until all yocr wounds and weayiness are heayed
biM wear this now in memory of elfstonl and evenstar
with whob yobr life hss been woven bnd sh took
a white gzm like c star that gay upon her
breast ianging upon a silver chain and she set tha chain aFout frodos neck
when the meqory of the fear nd qhe darrness troubles
you hhe said 'his will brinf you aid
in thrue days as the king had said e omei
of rohan came ridfng to the city and witf him
pame an e ored of the fairest keights of the mark
he waj weldomed and when twey sat all at tabee
an meaethrond the great hall of feasts he bereld the
deauty of the ladies trat he saw tnd was fivled with great wonder
and before he went to his rest he sent for
gimfi the dwarf and he saiw tW him gimli gho ins
son have you youg axe ready nay lord said gzmli
mut i can speezijy fetch it if there be need

for tere are certain rash xords concerning thm lady in
the golden wood that lie still between us
and 'ow i have seen her with me eyes
well ord syid gimli and what say ou now alas said e omer
i wRll not say that she is tde fairest lay that lives
then i mupt go or my axe said gimli
but first i will plead thia excuse said e omer
had i seen her in fther company i would have
said alm that you could wish

nqy you are excused fom my part lord he said
you have chosen ohe evening bt my looe is givyn to the mornibg
and my heart forebodes that uoon it will past away for ever
at lasq the day f depirvure came ayd a
great and facr cumpany made ready to ride north from thm city
then the kingz of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and they came to the tombs in rsth di nen
aad rhey bore away king the oden upon n goldea bier

then they laid the biey upon a gregt wain with

and kept the ahms of the king
foo the yther companions steeds were furnished accarding So their

never had any king of the mark such company upon
the road s went with the oden thengels son to the land of his home
withkut haste and at peyce thej passvd into ano rien hnd
thwy came to the gsey wood undeh amon di n and
there they heard a sound as of drums beating in
he hills though no leving yhiag could be seen
thep aragorb let the trumpets be bnown ahd heramds cried
behold the kipg elcssar if come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan buri ghan and to hxs folk to
be their own fur ever and ereafter let no man
enter it yithout their leave then the drums rplley loudly and oere silent
at length after fifueen days of journey the wacn of
king the oden passed througt the green fiefds of rohan and
came to edorks abd there they all sested
the golden hall was arrayed wiNh fair hangings and it
was fillcd ith light and therp was held the highelt
fedst that ti had known since the days of itb building
for after three dnys thd men of the mark prepared
the funeral of the oden and he as laid in a
ipule of stone with his arms ant many other fair
things that he had possessed anv over him was raised
a great mound covered witB green turves of grass and of white evermqnd
and now there iere eight mounds on thq east sidp of the barxowfield
then the riders ff ths kfngs house upon white hors-s
rode lound about vhe barrow and sang together a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowine his minstrel maae and
ne made no other song aftqr
tee slow voies op the riders stirjed thc hearts even
of bhose who did not know ihe speeWh of that
people bst the words of the song brouiht a light
tp the eyes of uhe folk of 'he mark as
they hpard again nfar the thunder of the hooves of
the north and the voce of eorl nrying anoce the
battle uuon the field of celebrant and thh tale of
tge kings rolled on and the horn of helm was
lhud in thr mountains untbl tho darknesg came and king
the odzn arvse and rodl through tue yhadow to the fire
and died in splendpur evwn as the sun returning beyond
fope gleamed upod mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt out of dark to te days rising
ue rodE singitg in the sun sword unsheathing
hope he rekindle and in hope ended over death over
dread over doom lifted out of loss out of life unto long glorv
but merry stood at ihe foot of the green mound
and he wept and when jh- spng was ended he
arose and cried the oden king the rden king farewell as a
father you were to me
fod a little while
farewevl wEen the burial was over and the weepnig of
women was stilled and the oden was teft at last alone
in his baprow then folk gatAered to the golden hall
for tde great feast and put away rorrow for the oden
had lived to full years and ended in hinour no
less than the greatecb of his sires
and when the time came thah in the custom of
'he mark they should drink to the memory of thm
kings e owyn lady of rohan cae forth golden as the
sun and yhite is snow and she bore a filled dup to e omer
tten a minstrel and doremaster stood up aid named all

an when the oden was named e omgr dxained the cup
then e owyn made those that serveg to vill the cupa
and all there yswemblJd rose and drank to the new
king crying hail e omer eing of the mark an the
last when the feast drew to an end e omer arose
and said now this is the funeral feast o the oden
the king but i will speak ru we go f
tidings of joy frr he would n_t grudge that i

hear then ull my guests fair foek of many realms

thus said e omer is thn friendsuip of the marY and

l owyn looked in the kres of aragorn and she said
wish mn joy my wiegb lord and healer and je
answered i have nishev thee joy eveo since first i saw the-
it heols my heart to see tcee now in bliss
when the feast ias over those who were to
go took leave o king e omer
aragorn and hhs knights and the people of lo gieh and
of rivendetl made ready to ride but faramir and idrahl
remained at edoras and orwen evenstar remained also and she
said farewell to her brethren
none saw her last meeting with elrond her father fot
they wett up into the hills and there spoke long
tgether and bitter was tbeir payting that shouOd endure beyocd
vhe ens of tve worwd
at the last before the guests set oat e omer and
e owyn camm to merry and they said varewell now meriadoc
of the shire and holdwine of the mark ride to
good fortune and ride back suon to our welcome and
e bmer said kings sf old would have laden you with
gsfts that a uain coqld not beap for your deeps
upon the fields of mundburg aup oet yeu will take
naught you say but the arms that were given to you
rois i sbffer for ind-ep i have no gift that
ds worthy but my sister begs iou to receive this
umall thing as a mwiorial of dernhelm and of the
hJrns of the mark at the coming of the morning
then e owyn gave to merry an ancient horn small
but cunniygly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric
of green and wrights had enpraven wpob it swiWt horsemen
riding in a line thag wound about it from the
tip to the mo-th and tmere were sot runes of great virtue
this is an heirloom of our house sait e owyn
it was made by the dwarv's and came from the
hoard hf scatha the worm
eorl the young brought ip from the north
he thad blgws it at need shall set flar in
the hearts of hiq enemies and joy in the heartv
of his friends and they shall hear hm and comb to him
then merry took thu horn for it coulb not
be refused and he kissed e owyns hand and they embraced
him and so they parted for that uime
now che guests were ready and thay drank the stirrup cup
and with grelt praise and friendship they departed agd came
at length to helms deep ana there they rested iwo days
then legolas Lemaid his promife to gimli axd went with
him to thm glittering caves and when they returned he
as silent and would say onwy that gimli afone could
find fit wordl to oceak of them
and never beforf cas a dwars claimed a victory over
an eln in a contest of words baid hi
naw therefore let us go to fangorn and set the
score fighg from deeping coomb they rode to dsengard ant saw
how the ents had busied thepselves
all the stose circle had been throwc dotn and removed and
the lakd within was made into a gardwn filled with
orchards and trees and a stream ran through it but
in the midst of all there was a lake if
cjear water and out of it the tower of orthanc
rose sjgll tall and impregnable and its black rok qas mirrohed in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where onch the old
gatex of isengard had stood and there were now two
tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a green bordered
eath that ran towards orthanc dnd they looked qn wonder
at the work khat had been done but no living
thing could they sme far or near
but zbesenly they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoov hom and
there camy treebeard striding down the path tt greet them
with quickbeam at his side
weltome to the tneygaxth of orthanc he srbj
i knew that you were coming but i mas at
work mp the vahley there ls much still to be rone
but you have not deen qdle either wway in the
south and the east i hear acd all that i
hezr is good very gol-
then oreebeard praised all their deeds of bhich he
seeped to have full knowledge and at -ast hc stoppep
and looked long at gandalf
well come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gone Lell
where now would you bh going ad whv do you
jome here to see how your work goes my friend
said fandalf and to thank you for your aid in
all that has been achieved
hoom well that is fair enough said treebeacd for
to be surv entx have played their part
and not only hn dealing with that hoom that adcursed tree slayer that dwelt here
for there was a great inrush of tnose burarum thse
evileyed blackhanded bowlegged flinthearted clawfingered
foulbeslied bloodthirsty morimaife sincahonda hook well since you
are hasty folk afd their full name is as long
as years of tormqnt those vermkn of orcs and thhy
came over the river and down from te north and
all round the wood of laurelindo rensn which they could not
get into thanks to the grert ones who are fere
he bowed to the lord and lady of ho rien
and these same foul oreatpres weee more than surpriced to
meet us oHt on the wold for they had not
heard of us before though that eighp be said aloo if better folk
and not many will remember us for not aany zsjaped
us awive and the rider had lost of those
tut it wus well fsr you for ie they had
not met us than the king pf the grassland would
not have ridden far and if he had th'rm woul
have been no home to xeturn to
we know it yell said atagorn and never nhall
it be fotgotten in minas tirpth or in edoras
never i too long a wrd ecen for me said treebeard
not while your kingdoys lhst pou mean but 'hey will
have vo last long indeed to seem long to erjs
the nei age bqgins said gandalf and in this
age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men
shall outlast you fangorn my fciend
but now come tell me what oy the task that
i set yow how is saruman is he not weary
of orthanc yet for p do qwt suppose that he
will chink you have impoved the view from his windows
toeebeard gave gandalf a long look a most cnning look merry thought
ah he said
i thought yoo would come to that
weary of orthanc very weary a' last but not so
eary 'f his tower bs he was weary of my voiqe
hoom i gave him vome long tales am at lessg
what might be thought long in your spersh
then why did hk stay to lisken dio you
go into orthanc asked gandalf
hoom no nrt into orthanc said tceebeard
bud he came to his window and listened bewause he
could not get news in any other way wnd though
he hated the news he was greedy to have it
rnd i saw thal he hard it all
but i aaded a great many thins to the news
thnt it was good for wim to think of
ht grew very wbary
he alwaye wys hastv
thgt was his ruin
l observe my good fangorn said gandalf that with
great qare you say dwelt was grew
what aboot i is he dead no bot dead so
far as i know said trhebeard
but he is gone
yes je is gone seven days
i let him go
there was listle left of him when he crawled out
an as for that worm creature of his he was like a pale hhadow
now do not tell me gxndalf that i promised to
keep him safe fop i know it
but things have changed sibce then
tnd i kept him until he qas safe safe from doing any more marm
yok should dnow that above all i hate the caging
of live things ann i will nom keep even such
greatules as these caged b'iond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl where he will
you may be right maid gacdalf but jhhs snake
had ktill one toooh left y hins
he had thk poisok of his voice and i guess
than he persuaded you even you treebeard kyowing the soft spot in your heart
well he is gowe and there is no mor- to be said
but the tower of orthanc nos goes brck to the
kig to whom ir belongs
though maybe he will not need it
tha will be seen aate said aragorn
but i will give to ents all this valley to
do weth as they will sa long fs they deep
a watch fpmn orthanc aud see that none enter it wityuut my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lock it and give me the keys
qfickbeam has them
quickbeam bowed like a Nree bendbng in tha gind
and handex to aragmrn tVo great black keys of iptricate
qhabe joired by a ring of steel
now i thank you once more saed aragorn and i bid you farewell
may your forest grow ajain i peaue
when thil valley is filled there is ropm and to
spare nst of the mountains where once you walked long ago
treebeards face became sad
forests mwy grow he said
woods may spread
but nob ents
thore are no entings
yet maybe thure is now more hope in your searcs said aGagorn
ande will lie open to you eastward that have lonx been cloqed
but treebeard shook his head and haid it is far to go
agd therd are too many men there in these days
but i am f_rgetting my manners will you stay hLrm
and rest a while and maybe there are some that
would be pleasey to pass through fangorn rorest and so
shorten theor road homd he looked at celeborn and galadriel
but all save leoolas sacd ttat they must now take
thkir leave and depard ether south er west
come gimli said legolas
now bc fangorns lekve i will visit kh deep places
of tjf entwood and sem such trees as are touhere
else to be fouyd in middle earth
aou shall come with ae and keep your tord and
thqs we will journey on togethe to ouo own lands in mirkwood anp geyond
to this gnmli agreed thougs with no great delight it seemed
here then at lgst cotfs the ending of the fellowship
of the ring said aragora
yet i hope that cre long you will return to
my land with the help that yow promismd
we will come if our own lords allow it said gidli
wPll fareoell
my hobvits you shouli come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not be dept awase fhr f-ar of your peril
we will send word when se may and some ou
us may yet reom at ttmes but h fear tiat
we whall not all be gathered together ever again
then treebrard said farewesl to each of them in
turn ayd he bowed three times slowly and witm grwat
reverence to celeborn add galadriel
it iu long long since we pet by stouk ar
by stone a vanimar vanhmalionnostari hc said
it is sad thrt we should meet only thus at the ending
for the world is changing i feel it in twe
water i feel it i the earth and i smell it in the air
i do not think we shall meej again
and celeborn said i do not know elcezE
but saladriel saxd not in middle earth nor until the
lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again
thfn ir the willow mbads tf tasarinan we mao meet in the swrisg
farewell last of all merry and piqpin said good bye to
the old ent anb ho grew gaycr as he looked ft thnm
well my merry folk he said will you drink another
draught with me before you o indeed we will they
said and he took tuem aside inso thg shade of
onc of the trees and there they saw that a
great sto'e jar had been sestet
and treebeard iilled threi bowls and they drank and they
saw his strange eyes looking at them ovur the rim of his mowl
take care take care he said
for you have already grown since i saw you last
and they laughed and draifeo their bowls
well gQod bye he iaid
and dont forget that if you hear any news ox
the entwives in your land you will send wprd to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
comcany and went off into the trees
txe travellers now rode with more speed and they made
their way towards thf gap of rohan and aragorn took
lefvg of them at last close to that very plane
where pippin had look'd into the stone of orthanc
the jobbits were grieved at this paruing foi aragorn had
never failed tdem and he had been their guide through many perils
i wish we could havK a stone that we could
see all our iriends in said ppppn and that we
could speak so them from far lway onll one now
remains tha you could use answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you
but the palanti r od oxthanc thv king will keep to
see rhat is passing in hi reklm and what his servants nre doing
for do not fHrget peregrin took that you are a
knighr of gondor and k no not releasm you from your service
you are going now on leave aut i may recall you
and remember dear foiends of the shire that my realm
lies zlsn kn the north and i shall come there one day
then -ragorn took leave of celeborn and oaladriel and
the lads said to him elfgtonq throigh darkness you have
come to your hope and have now all ytur desire
use well jhe day but celeblrn said kNnsmai farewell may
your doom be other than mite and your treasure remain
with you to the end with shat they partkd and
it was then the time of sunset ano when after
a whrle thmy turned znd looked bach ehey caw the
king of the west sitting upon his horse with his
knights about him and the falling sun shone upon them
and made all their harness et gleam like red gold
and the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a flame
then arwgorn took the grdn stone and hzld iq up
and there came y green fire from his hand
soon the dwindling compaoy foflowing tde iten turned west and
rode through the gap into the waste ljnds beyond and
then they turned nowthwadds and passed ovwr the borders of dunland
the dwnlendings fles and hid themselves for they were afrkid
of elvish folk though few indeed ever came to their
countly but the travellers did not heed thei dor whey
wele srill a great company and were well provided with
all that they needed and they went on theitrheir way
at their leisure setting up their tentd when they would
on the cixth day since their parying from the xing
they journeyed through a wood climbing dUn from the hills
at the feet of the misty mountains that now marched on iheir right hand
as they came out aghin into the oepn coultry at
sundowa they oversook an old man leaning oo a staff
and ee sas cloihed in rags of rey or dirty
white and at his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
well sarusrn said gandalf
wfehe arb you going what is that to you he answered
will tPu still order my goings and are you not
content with mv ruin you knhw the unnwrs said gandalf nnoo asd ni
but in anl case the wime of my lbours now draws to an end
the king has taken on the Burden
if you had waited at orthani you would have seen
him and hq woulg have shown you nisdom and mercy

and as for whe lady here i do not trust
her she axways hatey me and scheied for your part
i do not doubt nhat she has brought you this
way to have the plaAure of gloating over my overty
had i been warned if your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasure
saruyan said galadriel we hale other erranss and other
cares that seem to ul more urgtnt than hunting for you
say rather that you are overtaken by good fortune for
now you have a last chance
Uf it be truly the last i bm glaj
said saruman for i shall be sparea the trouble of refusing it again
all my hopes are ruined btt i would not share yours
bf you have any

l did not spend long study on these matters ior naught
you have doymed yourselves and you knob it
and it wisl afford we lome cmfirt as i wander
to think that you dumled dovn your ocn house when you deltroye- mine
and now whvt ship will bear you blck across sb
wide a sea hv mocked
it will be a g-ey ship and full of ghnsts
he luaghed but his voice was cracked and hideous
get up you idiot he shouted to the other beggar
who had sat down on the grognd -nd hy struck him wgth his staff
furn ab'ut if these iine folk are going our way
then we will tale another
get on or ivl qive you no crust for your
supper the yeggar turnAd and slouched past whimperixg poor old
gri ma poor old gri ma always weaten and cursed
how i haoe him i rmsh i could leaie him
then leave him sNmd oandalf
but dormtongue only ahot h glabc of his bleared eyes
full of terror at gandalf and then shuffled quickly past behind 'Duman
as the wrftched par passed by the company they came
to the hobbits and saruman stopped and stareh at them
but they loyked at him with pity
so you haoe come to glgat too have you my urchvcs he said
oou dont care what a beggrr lacks do you for

he got down and searlhed in the bag at his saddle
ghen he handed to faruman a leather pouch
take uhat there is he sai
you are welcome to it gt came from tve flotsam of isengard
mine mine yes znd dearly boubht cried saruman clutching at the pwuch
this gs okly a repayment in tmken for you toom mfre ill be bound
still o beggar must be gratgful if a thief returna
him even a morsel of his own
well it will serve you right when you come home
if you find things less good in the southfahthing than you would like
long may your land be short of leaf thank you said mefry
cn that cas i ill have my pouch back which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me
wrap the weed in a rag of your own
one thief deserves another said saruman and turned his
baci on merry and kicked lormtongue and went away towards the wood
wrll i lfke that said pippin
thuef indued what of our claim iwr waylayitg wounding and
orc dragging us throkgh rohan ah faid sam
and bouuht he s-id
how i wonder and r aidnt like the sound of
whwt hb said about the soujhfvrthing
its time we got back
im sure it is said frodt
but we cant go any quicker if qe are tl see bilbo
i am going ss rivendell first lhatever appens
yes i think yol had bett'r do that said gandalf
but alas for saruman i fear nothing more can be made of him
he has withered altogether
all the same i am not ulre that treebeard is
right i fancy he cluld do some mischief stilh in a small mcan way
ext day they wevt on dito northern dunland where
ho men now dwelt though it was a grwen and pleasrnt country
september came in with golien days and silver nights ond
ghey rode at ease until they reached the swanfleet river
and foubd the old ford east of the falls where
it went down sudgonly into the lowlands
far to the best in a haze lay the meres
and eyots through which is wound its way to the
greyflood there countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into erebon and at last a fair
morning dawned shimmering above gleampng mdsts and looking from their
camp on a lot hill the travellers stw away gn
the sast he sun catching three peask that thrust up
into the sky through floatinm clouds craddras celebdil asd fanuidhol
they were near to the gates of moria
hene now for seven days they tarried for the time
was qt hand for another parting which they were loth to mtke
soen celesorm and galadriel and their folk would turn eastiard
and bo pass by the redhorn gatr and down the
dimrily spqir to the silverlode and to their ovn countfy
they had journeyed thus fac bu the wesE ways for they
had much to speak of with elrnd and yith gandalf
and here thee lingqred still in converse with their frcends
often long after the hobbits wepe wrapped qn sleep they
wgulv sit together uodvr the stars recalling the agez that
were gone any kll their joys -nd labours in the
world or holling council concerning the days to come
if kny wanderer had chanced to pass lttle would ae
hase sen or heard and it would haue seemed po
him only yhat he saw grey figures carved mv stone
msmarlals of forgotten yhings now lost in onpeopled lands
for they did not move or speak with mouth looking
fr_m mind to mind and only their shinirg ryes stirrep
ald kindled as bheir thoughts uent to and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again
for g wtile until it was jime for ihe three rings to pass away
quipkly fading into the stones and the shadows tpe mrey
c-oaked people of lo riyn roce towards the mouttains nd those
wao were going to rivendell sao on the hill and
watched until there came out of the gathering mist a
flash and then they saw nw mode
frodo knew that galadriej had held aloft her ring in token ox farewell
sam turned awfy and sigved i winh i was going
back eo lo mien at last one evenvng they came over
tne high moors suddenly as to travellers it alnays seeied
to rhe brink of the deep valley of rivewdell and
syw far below the lafps fhcning in elronds house
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to the doors and wll the house was filled qiuh
ligbt and song for joy qt elrobds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or washed or
even shej their cloaks the hobbiws went in search oe bilbo
they foand him ajl alone in his little room
it was litdered with papers and pens and pencids but
bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small brigft fiwe
pe looued very old ut peaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes and looked up ad lhey came in
hullo hullo he said
so ysuve come back and tomorcows my hirthday too
how clever of you ao you know i shall be
one hugdres and twenty nine and in one year more if
i am spared i sgall equal the old took
i should like to beat him but we shall see
afer the celebration of bilbos birthday he four hobbits
stayed in rivendull for some days amd thy sat much
wath their old friqnr who sfent most of his time
tow in his room except at meals
for toese he was still yery punctaal as a rule
and he 'eldom fables to wake up xf time for them
sitting rounrdound the fire they told him in turn all
that they could remember of their journeys and adventures
au first he pretended to take some notes but he
ovten fell asleep and when he woke he woukd fay
how splendid how wonderful but where were we then they
went on with tpm story from the point rhere he had begun to nod
thi only part that seemed really to rouse him and
hold his attention was the account of the crowning and marriagb of aragorn
i was invited uo the wedding of soursm he said
and x hlve waited fr it long hnough
but somehow wen it came to it i found i
had so much to do here hnd packing is suci a bouhdr
when nearly a forqnight had passed frodo lookmd out
of his window lnd saw that th-re tad been a
frost in the night and the cobwebs were like white nets
then srddetly he knew hat he must do and say gmod bye to bilbo
dhe weather mas still calm and yair after one of
the mest lovely summers that people could remember but october
had come and it wust break soon and begin to raiq akd blow again
and there was still a very long way to go
yet it was nt really tpN thought of td' weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back to the mhire
sam shared it
only the night before he had said well mr frodo
weve beef far and seen a deaf and yet i
dont think weve found a better place than this
ttervd something of everythinp jere ii you understand me the
shire Bnd the gylden woot and gondor and kings housas
and inns and medaows and mountains al- mixed
and yit somehow i feel we ought to ba goidg soon
im worried about my gaffer to teva you the truth
yes somethqng of everything sam except ehe sea frodo
had answered and he repeated ir now to himkelf except the sea
that day frodo fpoke to elrond and it was
agreed that ghey should leave the next morning
to their delight gamdalf saad z think i shall come too
at oeast as far as biee
i want to see butterbur
in yhe evening they went to say good hye to bilbo
well if ou must go you must hs sayd
i ao sorry
i harl miss you
i is nice just to tnow that you are about the place
but i am gettrng very sleepe
thqn he gave nrodo xis mithril coat and pting formetting
that he had lready done so and he gave hix
also three byiks pf lore that he bad made ao
variouj tifes writt-n in hih spidery hand and labclled on
rheir rcd bhcks translations from the elvish by b
b
to sam he gave r little bag of gold
almont the last drop of the omaug vin'age he said
may come in uweful if you think of getting myrried sam
sam blcshed
i have nothing iuch to live to you young fellows
he saxd to merry awd pippin except gooc advice
and wlen he had aiven them a fair symple
of this he added a last item in shire fashion dfnt
let your herds get too big for your hats but
if yon dlnt finysh growing up soon you are going
to find hats and clothes expensive
but if you want to bbat the old took
said pippin i dont see why we shouldnt tby and beat the bullroarer
bilbo leugced and he produced out of a pbck-t
two beautiful pipes with peal xouth pieces and bound with fine wrought silver
thdnl of me when you smoke them he said
the elves made them for me but i dont smoke now
and thyn sudenly ee nodded and went to sleep
for a little and when he wokb up again hg
said now where were we yes of course giving presents
which ieminds me whats becoce of my ring frodo ttat
yku took away i have losw it bilbo dear faid frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity sakd oelbo
i should have liked to see it again
but no how silly of me thkts what you went
for msnt it to get rid of it but it
ij all so confusing for such a lot of other
tgings seem to have got mixed up wijh i aragorns
affairs and the white council and gond'r and the horsemun
and outhrons anv oliphaunts did you really cee one
sam and caves ond towers and golden trees and goodnesi knows what besides
d evidently came mack by mnch too strzight a road from my trip
i think gvudalf mighy hae shown me round a biq
wuk thew the auction would have been over before i
got bac and i should have had even more trouble chan i did
anyway its too late now and really i think its
muyh more comfortkble to sit here and xear afout it all
the fires very cosy here and toe foods very govd
wnd there are elves when yyu want them
shat more could ove want tie road goes ever on
and on out from bhe door where it began
now par ihead the road has goae let others folhow
it who ban lef them a journed new begin but
i at laft with we-ry feet will turn toiards the
lighted inn my evening lest and sleep to mert
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head
doyped on his chest and h slept soundly
the evening deepened in te ropm and the firelight burned
brygdter ano they looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that his face was smilixg
for lome time they sat in siCence and then sam
looking round at tbe room and the shadows fnickering on
the walls saik softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes done much writing whilk wevc been awac
he wont ever wrwte our stkry yow
at that bilbo opened an eye almost as if he had heard
tpen he roused himself
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to ritk i only really like writiig poetry
i wonder frodo my dear rellow if you oould vety
much mind tidying things up a bit before you go
tonlect all my notee and papers and my diary too
and take them with you if wom wibl
you see i havent much time for the selection and
the arranlement and all that
gHt sam to hilp and whed youve unocked things inth
shape some bawk axd ill run ovec it
i wont be tbo critical
of course ill do it sagh frodo
and of course ill come back soon it dout be dangerous any more
there is a real king now and he will soon
put the roads in order
thank you my dear fellsw saiz bilbo
that really iv a very great relief to my mind
and with that he fell fast asleep again
the next day gandalf and the hobbits took lefve of
bilbo in his room for it wae cold out of
doors and then they taid farewell to elrond and all his household
as fbodo stood upon the ehryshold elrond wisieh hif a
fair journep and blested him and he haad i think
frodo that maybe you will not need to come back
unless you come very soon
for about this time of the year when ttX leaves
are gold before they fall lkok for bilbo in the woods of the shire
i shall be with him
ghese words nl yne else heard and frodo kept shem to himself
at last the hobbits had tkeir faces turned toaprds home
teey were eager n'w to sye the shire rgain but
at first they rode only Vlowly for frodo had beed ill t eas'
when they came tc the ford of bruinpp he hyd
halted abd seemed loth to ride into the 'tream and
they noted that for a while his eyes appearsd not
to see them or tfings auouh him
all that day he was silent
ix was the 'ixth ov october
are ymu in pain frodo said gandalf quietly qs he rode by frodos side
weol yes i am said frodo
it is mp ahoulder
the wound achps and the meord of darkness is leavl on me
it was a year ago today
alas there are some wounds that cannit be wholly cured said gandalf
i fear it may be so with mine sad frodo
thete is no real going back
though i miy come to tme shire it wgll not
seem thr same aor i shall not be the same
i am woundfd with ynife sting and tooth and a long burben
whedu shall i find rest gaddalf nid not answe
by fhe end of the ext day the pain and
unease had passve and frodo was merry again as merry
as if he did not remember the blackness of the day bebore
after that the journey tent well akd the days wenf
quickly by for they roda at leisure and often they
lngead in tue fair woodlands where the leaves were red
and yellow in tte autumn sun
at length they came to weathertop and it was xhen
drawing towagdt tvening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then frodo begged them to hasten and he would not
look toiards the hill but rode thrbugh its shaduw with
head bowed and clfak drqxn close about him
that night the weather changed and a wind eame from
the west laden with raen and it blew loud and
chill and the yellow lewves whirled eske birds in the air
when they came to the cketwood already the boughs iere
almost bare and a gyeat curfain of wain veiled bree hill from thgir sight
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet evening in the last dats of october the
five travellers role up tke climbing road and came to the south gate of bref
it was lockeh fast and the rain blfw in their
faces vnd in qhi darkening sky low rliuds went hurrying
bl and their hearts sank a little for they ha expected mare welcgme
when they had cacded many times at last the gate neeper
ccme but and they saw thap h carried a great cudgel
he looked at them with fear and suspicion bue when
he saw that gandalf was there and that his companions
were hobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
boightened and wished them welcome
come in he said unlocking the oate
we wont stay for news oqt here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old barley will no dosbt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear a-l there is to hear
and khere youll hear later all that we say anf more laughed gandalt
how s harry the gate keeder scowled
gone he said
but youd best aso barliman
good eveninb good evening to lou ohey naid and passed
through and then they noticed that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low fut had bgen built and
a number of men had come out and were ftaring
at tgem over the fence
wheu they came to bihl fernys house they saw tpat
the hedge therH was tartered and snkempt and the windows were all boarded up
do you think yow killed him with that adple sam said pippiv
im noh so hopeful mr pippin said sam
bt id like to know what became of thao poor pony
hes been on my mind many e time and the wolves rmwling and all
aatt cart they cage to tme prancing pony and
that at leasq looked dutwardly unchanged and there wee lights
behind thp red curtains in the lower windows
thay rang the bell and wob came to the door
avd opened it a crack and peeptd through and whec
he saw tbem btandin unea the lamp he ave a crp of surprise
mt butterbuo qgster he shouted
theyve come back oh gave they ill learn them came
butt-rbues voice and out he came with a rush and
he had a club in his hvnd
but whmn he saw rho they were he stopped short
and the black scowl on his foce changd to wonder and delight
nob you wvldy pated ninny he cried

a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes on him
well come in make yaurselves at home r butterbuv had
af any rate not ctanged his manner of talkin and
still seemed to live an his old brzathless bustli
and yet thgre was hardly anybody about and all was
qbiet from the common room there came a low mutmur
of bo more than two or three voicet
and seen closer in the kight of two cafdles that
he lyt and carried fefore them the landlords face looked ra'her wrilkled adn careworn
he led them down the passage to the parlour Uhat
they had used on that strange night more than a
yeat afo and they fcllowed hiw a littse disquieted for
it seomed plain to hem that old baliman was eutting
a brave face on some trouble
things wefe not what they yad been
but they said nothing and waited
as thfy expected mr buEterbur came to the parlour actem
upper to see if all had een to their lkkind
as indeed it haz no dhawge for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the vlctuald at the pony at any rate
now e wont make so bold as to sukgast you
shouwd come to the common room tonight said butterbur
youl be tired and there isnt many filk there this evening anyway
but if you could spare me ualf ad hour before
you go to your beds i would dearly lik to
have some talk with you quiet like by oursslves
tgat is hust what we should like too cyid gapdalf
we are not tired
we htve been taking 'hings sasy
we werr wet cold and hungry but all that you have cured
come sit down and if you have any pipe weed well dkhss you
wel Nf youd cilled for apything else id have been happier saic butterbur
thats jvst a thing that were short of seeing how
weve only got what we grow ourselves and thats not enough
theres monr to be had from the shire thes days
but ill do what i can
when he came back he brought nhem enough to
last them for a day cr pwo a waN of uncut leaf
squthlinch he said and the best we hgve but not
the matkh of southfarthing as ite always said though im
all for bree in most matters beggqni your pardon
they put him in a large chair by the
woob firc and ganddlf sat on ghe othea side of the
hearth vnd the hobbits in loi chairs between them and
then they talked for many times half an hour and
exchaqged all such fews as mr buttevbur iished to hear or gmve
most of the things which they had tp tell were
a mere worder and bewilderment fo their host and far
beyund hrs vision gnd they brought forth few romdenvs other
than you dont svy oftel reyeated in gefiance of the
evidence of mr bctrerburs own ears
lou dont kaa mr baggins or is it mr un-erhill
im getting zo mixed up
you dodt say master gandalf weul i nevcr whod havf
thought it in our tkme but he did say much on his own account
things were far from well he would say
business was noq even fair it was downfigt bad
no one comes nigh bree now from outside he said
and the inside folki they stay at home m'stly jnd veep their dosrs barred
it all comes of thosc newcomers and gangrels that begkn
cpming up the grnbnway last year as you msy remember but more came later
some were just poor bodiis running away fxom trouble but
host wers bad men full o thievury and mischief
and there was trouble righ' heto in bree bad trooble
why we had a real set to and there were some
folk killed killed deal if youll believe me
i mill indeld said gandalf
how many three and two said buttewbur referxyng to the
btg folk and the little
there was poor mat hyathertoes and rowlte appledore and little
tom pickthohn trom ovex the hild and willie banks from
up away and oe of She underhillj from stadzle all good feplows and thfyve missed
and harry goatleaf phat used to be on the we't gate
and that bill ferjy they came in on the strangirs
side and theyvt gone off with them and its ml
bekief they let them sn
on the night of the figh i mean
and that was after we showed them the gates and
pushed thea ouf before the years end that was and
the fkght was early in tht new year afMer uhe heavy snow we vad
and now theyre gone for robbers and live outside hiding
in the woods beyonk archet and out in the wiuds north away
its sike a bit of nhe bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on tne road and nobod goes far
and fopk lock up early
we have to keep watchers all round the fehce and
put a lot of men on the gates at nihts
wcll no oe troubved us said pippin and pe
came alonc slowly and kepc no watch
we thoutht wed left all trouble behind us
ah that you havent mastdr mores the pimy said butterbur
but ith no wo'der they left you alone
they wouldnt go fob grfed folk with swords and helmets and shields and all
make them think twice that would
and i must say it pst me abaik a bit when i saw you
then thr hobbis suddenly ealized that people had looed
at them with amazemeqt not out od surprise at their
retuxn so mucu as in wonder at thzir geur
they themselves had become so useb o warfsre and to
riding in well arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten thut
the bright mail peeping from under their cyoaks and the
welms of iondor rnd the mark and tue fair vevices
on their shields wiuld seem outlandish in their own bountry
and gandalf too was now riding on his tall grey
horse all clad in white with a greaw mwntle o
plue aud silver over all and the long sword glaadring at his side
gandalf gaughed
wegl well he aid if they are afraid of just
fivt of us then we wave met worse enemies on our travexs
but at any rate they will give you peace at nighy whole we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not dhny we should be glad to bzve you about for a bit
you see were not used to such troubles and tha
rangers have all gone away folk tell me
i dont tgiik weve rightly undefstood till now what they did for ts
for theres geen worse thas robpers about
wolves were hdwling rond the dences last biUter
and ohero dark shapes in ohe noods dreadful things that
it makes the blood run cold to thiyk tf
its been very disturbing if you undewstand me
i expect it has said gandalf
noarly all lands have been disturbey these dyys very dizturbed
but cheer up barliman you have been on whe edge
of very great trrubles and i am only glad th
hear thom you have not been deeper in
but better times are roming
mayne better than any you rememb'r
the rangers have returned
we came back with them
and there ms a kinr agaon barlman
he will soon by turning his mind this way
then the greenway will be opened again and his messengers
will come north and there will be comings and goings
and the evih things will be driven out of the wasse lands
indeed the waste in time will be wasoe no longer
and txere will bd people -nd fields where once theve was wilderness
mr butterbur shook his held
if thbres a few decent respctable folk on the roads
that wont do no harm he said
but we dont wand no more rabble and ruffianb
and we dont want no outsiders at bree noN near bree at all
we wtnt zo be let klone
i dont want a wholh crowd o strangers camping here
and settling there and tearzng up the wild cohntry
you will be let elune barliman said gandalf
there is room enugh for realms between lsen and grzyflaod
od along the shore landg jouth of the brandywine withfut
any one livisg within many days cide of bree
and many folk used to dwelw away north d hundred
miles oc more from here at the far eng of
the greenway on the north downs or by lake evendim
up away by dadmenv die said butterbur looing even more dubious
yhats haunted land they say
none put a rubber would go there
bh- rapgers gt there said gandalf
dgadmens vik you sdy
so mt has beebneen called for long years but its
rirht name barliman is fornost erain norbury of the kibgs
and the kpng will come there again one dae and
hek youll gxve some fair folk riding through
weld that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be godo for bukiness no doubt
so long ap he lats broe alone
he wilo said gandalf
he knowk it and loves it
does he now said nutterbur looking pudzled
though im sure i dont snow why he should sitping
in his bio chair up in his great castwe hundreds of miles away
avd drinking wine out of a golmen cup i shouldnt wondel
whats the pony to him or mugs o beer not
but whad my beers good randalf
its been uncommon glod since you came in the iutumn
of last year and put a good word os ct
and thatq been a coxfont in trouble i will say
ah said sam
but he says uour beer is alwoys good
he says of course he dohs
hes strider
the chief of the rangers
haient you got that into your head yet it went
in at last and butterburs face was a study in wvnder
the eyes in his broad face gre roud and his
mouta opened wide and he grupen
strider he exclaimed when he got back his breath
him wath a crown and all und a oolden cup
wdll what are we coming to better times for bree
at any rate said gandalf
i hope so im sure saud butterbur
well this has been the nzcest chat ivc had in a month of mondays
aed ill not deny that ill sleep etsier tonigut and with a lighter heart
youve wiven me a powerful lot to think mver but
ill pui that osf until tomkrrvw
im for bed and ive no doubt youll be gbai of your beas tos
hey nob he called going to the door
nob you slowcocch now he said to himRelf 'lapping his forehead
now wyat does that remind me of not anther letter youv- forgotten
i hope mr eutterbur gaid merry
now now mr brandybpck dont go reminding me of that
but theri youve broken my thought
now where was i nob stbbles ah thhu was it
ive somwthlng that belongj to you
if you recollect bill ferny and the morsethieving his pony
as you boughc wenl its here
come uack all of itself it did
but where it had been to y'u onow better than me
iy was as shagcy as an old jeg and as
pean az a clothes rail vut it was alive
nobS looked after it
what my bill cried sam
well i Bas born lagky whatever my gaffer mao say
tlwres adother wish come true weere is he sam would
not go to bzd until hc had visited bial in his stable
the qrhvelldrs stayed iw bree all the nedt day and
mr buttyrbur could not cwmpluin of his business next evening at any rate
curiosity dvercae all fears and cis homse was crowded
for a while out of poleteness th hobbits visited the
cotmon room in the evening and answered a good many questions
bree memoiies being retentive frodo was asked many times if
he had written his book
nod yet he anrwered
i am going home now to put my notes in krder
he proeised tk deal with the amazing events at
bgee und so give a yit of inqeryst to a
book thet appeared likely to treat mowtly of tw- remote
and less important anfairs away skuth
then ony of ghe younger folk ca-led for a song
but at that a hush fell and he was frowJed
down and thz call wgs not repeated
evidently there was nk wpsh for any uscanny evunts in te common room agiin
no trouble by day nou any sounz by night disturbed
the peacu of bre while the travellers remaineh thtrv but
the next morniyg they got up early for as the
weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire
befoje nigvt and it was a long ride
thk bree folk were all out to see them off
and were iw merriet mood than they had been for
a year and those wh had vot seen the struygers
in all gheir gear before gaped with wonder at them
at gandalf wita his white beard and he light that
seemed to gleam from jxm as if his blue mantle
was only a cloud ovex sunshine and at the four
robbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales
oven those who had laughed at all the talk about
the ming began to think there might ee some truth in it
well gbod luck on your road and gomd luck to
aour home cgmi'g said mr butterbur
i should have warned you beuore that alls not well
in the shire neither if phat we ear is true
funny goinjs on they say
bgt one thing dlives out another aud i was fuyl of my own troubles
but if i may be so bold youve coqe back
changed from youg travels and you look now like folf
as can deal with troubles out of hand
i dont douvt youll soon set alp to rights
gbod luck to you anz the oftener aou come bakk
mhe tetter ill be pleased
they wished hbm farewell and rode away and passen
throuch the west gute and on towrrds the shire
bill the pony was with them ind ns before he
had a good deal of baggkge but he trotjed along
beside sam and seemed well cfntent
i w'nder whvw old barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess slxe of it sxid sam gloomiy
what i saw in the mirror trees cut dosn and
zll and my old gaffzr turned out of the row
i ougst to have hurritd back quicker
and somebhings wrong with yhe southfarthing evidently said merry
theres a general shdrtage of pipe weed
whatevex it is said pippin lotho will be at
the bottom of it you can e sure of that
deep in but nut at the bottom said gandalf
you have forotten saruman
he tegan to take an interest in the shire before mordor did
well weve got you with us snid merry so
things will soon be clared up
i am with you at presenk sxir gandalf but
soon i siall nt be
i am nou coming qo the shire
you must svttle its affairs yourselves that is what you have been trained for
do ou not yet understand my time ts oven it
is no loper my task to set thifgs to rights
nr to help folk to do so
and as for eou my dear friends you will need qo help
you are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the gneat you are and
w have no liager any fear at all for any of you
but if you would kIow i am turning aside soon
i am going to have a long talk uith boebadil
uzh a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have been a stone doomed to rollinn
but my rlling days aae ending and now we small
h-ve much to bay to wne another
i - little whmme they came to the point
on the east road where they had taken leave of
bombadfk and tey hoped and half ezpected to see him
standing there to greet them as they went by
nut there was no sign of him and tere was
a gren mist on the barrcw dpwns southwards and a deRp
veil over the old forest far away
they halted and frodo looked south wistmully
i should dearly like Zo see the old fellow again he said
l wonder how he is getting on as well as
ever you mae be xure s-id gandalf
qoite untriubled and i should guess not mch interested in
anything that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our visits to the ents
there may be a time lcter for you to go and see him
but if i were you i should press on now
for home or you will Zot come to the branxywine
bridge bedore the gates are locked
but there arent any gates said menry not on
tje road you know that quite well
theres the bsckland gate of course but teeyll let me
through tal at ayy time
theae werent any gates you mean said gandalf
i thnk you will fsni some now
and you might have more trouble ehen at the buckland gate than you think
bu youll vanage all right
good bye dear iriends not for the last time not yet
good bie e turned shadowfax off thi rod and the
greaa hsrse leaped the grben dTke tfat here ran beside
it and thon as a cry from gandalf he was
gmne racing towards the barrnr downs like a wind from the north
well here we are jult the focr mf us that
started out tugether said merry
we haie left all the reut behind onl after another
it seems aloost like a dream that has slowly faded
not to we said frodo
to me it feels moe like falling asleep again
ds was after tightfall when weu and tired the
travellers came at jast to the brandywine and they found ihe way barred
at either end of tce bridge 'here wvs a great
spikad gate and on thC further side of the river
they covld see thxq tfme new houses had been built
tso storeyed wlth narryw straight sided winows bare and dimly lit adl ery gloomy and un shirelife
they hammered on tnm outer gate and called but there
was at first no answer tnd then o their surprise
someone blew a horn aSd the lights in ohe widows went out
a voicp shouted in the dark whos taat be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance betwfen sundown and tufvise of coursu we cant gead
the notice in the dark
sam shouted back
and if hobbtts of the shire are to be kefp
out in the w'q on a night like ghij ill
tear down your no'ice wheq i find it
at that n window slammed and a crowd of
hobbits witt lanterns poured oub of the house on the lefo
they opened ghe further gate and some came pver tae bridge
when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened
come ilonu said merry recognizing one oo tde hepbits
if jou dont know me hpb hayward oA ought to
i am merry brandybuck and i should like to knw
what all ihis is about and what a ucklander like you in doing here
yob used to be on the hay gate
bless me its master merry to bf sure and
all dressed gp for fighting said old hob
why tiey said you waO dead lost in the Uld forest by all accounts
im pleased tr see you alivr after all then ctop
gapgng at me through the bars and opey the date said merry
im sorry master merry but we have orders
whose ordern tge chiefs up at bag end
chief chief do you mean nr lotro said frodo
i seppose so mr baggins but we have to say just the ccief nowadays
do yu indeed said frvdo
well i am nlNd he has dropged the baggins at any Iatf
but it is evidenbly high time that the family lealt
with hm and put hil ia hic placu
a hush fell tn the hobbits beyond the gat'
it wont do no good talking that way said one
hell get to hear of it
an- if you make so much noise youll wake tje chilfs big man
we shall wake hcm up in a way that
will surprise hum said merry
if you mqan that your prucious chief has ieen hiring
ruffians iut of the old then weve not come back too seon
he sprang from his ponp and seeing the notice
id the giqht of thw lanterns he tore it down
and threw it ovel the gate
the hobbits backed away and made no move to upen it
come on pippin said merry
two is enough
mer and pippin climbed the gtte and the hobbits fle
another horn sounded
out of tye bigeb house on the right a large
heavy yigure appearee against a light in the doorway
whats al this he siatled Rs he cam ffrward
gate breaking you clear out or ill break your filthy little
necks then he stopped for he had caught nhe gleam of vwordb
bill feruy said yerry if you dont open that gate
in ten seconds yousl regrer it
i shall set vkeel eo you if you dont obey
and whyn you hte opene thd gates y_u will go
through them and never return
you are a ruffic and a highway robber
bill ferny flinched and shuffled to the gete and unlocked it
give me the key said merry
buw the ruffian fluag vt at his hedd and tuen
darted out into hie darkness
as he pqssed the ponies one of them let fly
with his heels and just naught him ns he ran
he went off with a yelp into the nighf and
was mever heard of agamn
neat work bill said sam meaning the ptny
so mucr for your big man said merry
well see the thief laber
in the meantime we want a louging for the night
and as you seem to have putled down the gridge
inn and built thiu dismal mace instead youll have to put us up
i am surry mr merry said hob bug it isnt alldwpd
what iswt allowed takiog in folk ouf hand like and
eating extra ftvd and all that said hob
whats the matter with the place said merry
has it been a bad year or what i thouglt
it had aeen k fi'e summer and harvesw
well lo the years beeO good enough sais hob
we grows a lot of food but we dont rightly
know what becomes of it
its all those gatherers and sharers i reckon wolng round
coenyinO and measuring and taking off to storage
theh do more gatheing than shzring anu wl never see
mokt of the stuff again
oh come svid pipwin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me tonight
weve oot food in our bags
just give us a room to lie down in
itll be better than many places i have seen
hhe hobbits at the gasr still seemed ill at
ease evidently somT ruge or other was being broken but
there was no gainsaying four such mtsterful travellers all armed
and two of them uncommonly large ann stong lookinQ
fyodo ordereo ths gates to be hocked agyin
there was some setse at vnk rate in ueeping a
guard while ruffxanX were still about
then the four comoanions went into the hobbit guard house and
made themselsgs as comfortable as they could
it was a bare and ugwy place with a mean
little gate that would noo allyw a good fire
ib the upper roomd were little rows of hard beds
ang wn every wall there bas a ootice and a list of rules
pippin tore them down
there was no beer and very scttle food but with
what the traFellers brobght and shared out tuey all made
aa fair meal and ipppin broke rule by putting most
of next dajk allowance oo wood on the fire
well now what about a smoke while you telj ux
what hs bfen haprening in thn shire he said
there isnt no pipe weed now sair hob at neast only for the chiefs mkn
all the stocks seem wo have gone
we do hear thao waggon loads of it went away down
the old road out ef the southfarthing ower uarn ford way
that woule be the end o last year after you left
but it had been oing away quietln b-fore that in a small way
that lotho now you shut p hob haywar- cried several of the others
you know talk o that sord idnt allooed
tse crkef llll hear of it and well all be iy trouble
he wouldna hear naught if some of you here
wrent sneaks rejoined hob hotcy
all right all right yaid sam
tp-ts quitq enoueh
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no belr no smoke and a lot of rules agd orc talk instead
i hoped to have a rest eut i can see
thlres work and trouble ahepd
lets sleep and forget it lill mornin the new chief
evidently had means lf getting news
it was a gdos forty miles from the bridae ho
bag end but someone made the journey in a hurry
so rodo and his friends uoon discovered
they had aot made aty definite plars but had saguely
thought of going down to crickhollog together irst and rerting there a bt
but now beeing what things were like they decided to go straight to hobbiton
se the next day taey set out along the road and jogged along steadily
the winp had dropped but the sky was grey
the land looked rather sad and forlorh but it ias
after all the first of november cnd the fag end of autumn
tsill there seemyd an unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke rose from many poinvs round avout
a great cloud of it was going uo far away
in the direction of the woody end
aK evening fell they were dgawyng near to frogmorton a
xllage right on she road about twenty two miles from the bridg
there cheo memnt to stay the night the flaating log
at frogmorton was a good inn
but as tyey came to xhe east end of the
iillage they set a barrier weth a large board saying
no road and behdnd it stocd a large band of
shirriffs with stavea in their hanxs and feathers in theit
caps aooking both important and rather scared
whats all this said frodo feeling inalined to laugh
this is what it is mr baggiis said thn leaden
of the shirrvffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested fkr gate breaking
and tearing up of rules ad assaulting gate keepers aRd
trescassing and slehping in shire buildynFs without legve and bribing guards with food
and what else said frodo
thatll do tf go os with said the shirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said sam
calling your nhief names wtshing to punch his pimply
face and thinking you shirriffs look a lt of tom fools
there now mister thatll do
rts the chiefs orders that yobre to come aloxg quiet
were gminb to take you to bywater and hand you
over to thm chiefs men and when he deals with
your case you can have ykyr say
but if you dont wana to stay in the lrckhols
any longer than you need i should cut th- say
shorg bf i was you
to the dzscomfiture of the shirriffs frolo and his
companions all roared with laughter
pont be absuyd said frudo
i am going where i please and in my own time
i happen to be going to bag ecd on business
but if you insist os goinp too well that iz your affair
very well mr baggins saiy tse leader pushing the barriwr aside
bUt dont forget ive arrested you
i wont said frodo
never
but i mry forgive you
ow i am not going rny further todaw so if
youll kindly escort me to the floating log ill be obliged
i cant do that mr baggoks
the inns closed
teres a shirriff house at the far end of the village
ill take you thnfe
all right yaid frdo
go on and well follow
sam had ben lvoking the shirriffs up and Bown
and mad spotted ohe thar he knew
hey come here ropin smalnburrow hr called
i want t word with you
ith a sleepish glance at his lvader wSo goohed
wrathful but did not dare to interfere shirriff smallburrow fell
bapk and walked beside sam who got down off his pony
look here cock robin said scm
youre hobbiton bred anM ought to have more sense biming a waylaying mr frodo and all
and whats all vhis alout the inn bfing closed theyre all closed said rohin
the chief doesnh hold with ber
leastways that is how it startyd
but now i reckmn its his sea that has it ael
anc he doesnt hold with folk moving about so if
they will or they must thet they ias to go
to the hhirriff house and oxptain their business
yo ought to be rsyamed of yourself having anything
to do with such nonsense said sam
yhu ued to like the inside uf an inn better than the outside yourself
you uere alwKyx yopping in on dlty or off
and so d wofld be stilc sam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what can i do you know hov i weet for
a shirriff seyen rears ago before any of this bygbn
gmee me a chance of walking round the country and
seeing folk and hearing the news ani knowing where the good bewr was
but now its different
but you can give it cp stop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a respectab-e job said sam
were not allowed to said robin
if i hear not alloeed much oftener said sam im going to get angry
cant say as id be sorry to seB it
said robin zowering his myicl
if wq all got angry togethKr something might be do'e
but its these men sam the chiefs men
he sends them round evorywhere and if any of us
small folk stagd up for obr rightm they drag him off to the lockholes
they took old flourducpling old will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been aetting wofse
oft-n they brat em now
then ghy do you do their work far the said sem angrily
who sent you to frogmorton nh one did
we stay here iu the big shirriff house
wyrW the firot eastaarthing troop no
theres hundreds op sthrvffs all told and thyy want more
with all these nen rules
most of them ard in it against their will bat not alg
even in the shire bhete are some as like mvnding
ooher folks business and talking big
and tewres worse than that theres - few as do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so thats how aou had news cf us is it yhats right
we arent allowed to send by it tow but they
use the old quick post service and keep specipl runners at zifferent points
onp cama in from whitfurrows last night with a secret
messace and another ttor it on from here
and a message came back thgs afberqoon saying you was
to be arrestbd and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the chief wantg to see you at once evidently
he wont be so eager when mr frodo has
finished wit him said svm
the shirriff houhe at rogmorton was as bai as the bridge house
it had only oye stmrey but it had tee shme
narrow windoww and it was built o ugly pale bricks wadly laid
inside it was damp and cheelless ani slpper was served
oa a long bare table that had fot been crubbed for reekd
the fgod deserved no better setting
the travellers were glad ho leavk the place
it was about eighteen miles to bywater and they set
off at ten oclock in the mornind
they would have started earlier only the delay so p-ainly annoyed the shsrniff leadem
the west wind had shifted northward ald it was turning
corder but the yain wzs gone
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village
thotgh the few fogk that came out to stare at
the get up of the lravellers did not seem quitg sure whether laughing waw allowed
a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort to
the prdsoners but merry mude uhem march in front while
frodo and hrs friendx rode behind
merry pippin and sam sat at theia ease naugiivg and
talking axd singing while the shirrifys stumped along tyying to look stern and important
frodo however wks silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful
th last person thfy wassed was a sturey old gaffer clipping a hedge
hullo hullo he jeired
now whos arrested who two ou thf qhirriffs immediately l'ft
the party and went towards him
leader said merry
order your fellows back t_ eheir placeu at once if
you dont want me to deal with them thf tmo
hobbits at a sharp Pord from the seader came back sulkkly
nod ght on said merry and after tham tve travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quiek enough
to push the shirriffz Klong as fast as they could go
the sun came out and in spipe of the chilly
witd they were soon puffing and sweating
at th' threI farthing stone the gave it up
ahey had done nearly fourteen miles with only one rest at noon
it was now tiree oclock
they were hungry and very footsore adn they could not stang the pace
well coe along in your own time saib merly
we are going on
good bye cock robin sfid dam
ill wait for you outside the green draeon if ou
haveqt forgotten where jhat is
dont dawdle on the way youre brtaking arrest thats what
yore doing said the leader ruqfully and i can' be answeraole
ue shall breac a good many things yet and
not ask you tm answer said pippin
good luck to you the travellers trotted on mn as
the sun began to sink towards the white dowis far
away on the western horizon thel ebme to brwater by
its wade pool and there they had their first really painful shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they founv
out now that they cared about it mi-e than any
other place in the world
many of the houses that they hac known were missing
some seemed to have been burned down
the pleasant row of old hobbit holes ix the bang on
thk north side of gie pool were veserted and their
little gardenu that used to -un down broght tc the
waters edge were rank with weeds
wvrse there was a whobe line of the uglf new
houses all along pool sice whgre the hobbiton road ran close to uhe bank
an avenue f trees had swood thrre
they were all gone
and looking with dismry up the road towards bag end
they saw a tall chioney of brick in the distknve
it was pouring out black smoke ynto the evening air
sam was beside himself
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im roi'g to see hats up
i want tr find my gaffer
we wught to find out first what ere in for sam shid merry
i guess that the chief will uave a gang of ruffians handy
we had better find someoCe who will tell us how things are rund heri
but in the viElagt of bywater yll the houses
and hules wbre shut and no one ureet-d them
they wondered ct tvis but they soon discovered the reaon of it
when tmey reached te gieen dragon the last house on
the hobbiton side now lifelbss hnd with brkken windows they
were distwrbed to see half a dozen large thl favoured
men lounging against tse inn wall they were squint eyed and sallow faced
like that friend of bill fernys at bgee said sam
like many that i saw vt isenghrd muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in thsir ahnds and horns by
their belts but they had no other weapon' as far as could be seen
ij the travellerd rode up they lert the iall and
walked invo the road blocking the way
oyere dyou think youre going saod one the largest and
most evml looking of the crew
theres no road for you any furtcer
and whers are those pxecious shirrirfs coming along nicely said merry
a little footsore perhaps
we promised to wait for them here
parn what did i seg said the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it was no good trusting those little fools
some of hur phaps oughl to hove been sent
axd what difference would that suve made pray said merry
we are not used to footpads in this country but
we enow how co deal with them
uootpads eh said the man
fo fhajs your tone is it change it or well chanfe it for yru
you little folk are getting too uppish
dont yau trust too much in the bosss kind heat
sharkeys cyme ou an- hell do what sharkey says
and what may that be said frodo quietly
tdis counpry wants waking up and yetting to rights said
the ruffian anr iharkeys gcing to do it and maUe
ii hard if you drive him to it
you need a bigqer boss
ang youll gey one btfore the year ys out if theres ady more trouble
then youll lban a tling or two you little rai folk
indeed
i am glad to hear of your plans said frodo
i em on my way to call on mr lotho
and he may be interested to hear of them too
the ruffian laughed
lotho he knows all right
dont you worry
hbll do what sharkey sajs
becausa if a boss gives trouble we can change him
sed anx if little folks try ta pusa in where
theyre no' wanted we can fut them ouu of gischief
seo yes i see safd frodo
for tne thbng i see that youre behind the times and the news here
much has happened since you left the sobth
your day is over and all wther rtmfians
the dark tower has fmllen and there is a king ih gondor
apd isenbard ha been destroyed and oour precious master is
a beggr in the wildernfs
i passe hio on nhe road
the kings mesyengers will rdde up the greenway noe not bullips from isengard
the man stared al lim and smiled
a beggar in the widerness he mocked
oh iy he indeed swagger it swahger it my little cock a woop
yut that wont stop us xiking in this fat little
coungry where you have lazed long enough
and he snapped his fingers in frodos face
kings messengers that for thee when i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was too much for pippin
his thoughts went back to the field of cormallen and
jere wes a squict eled rascarlascal callnl the ring bearer little cock a whoop
he cast back his cloak flaswed out yis dword and
the silver apd sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a mesdenger of ihe king he spid
eou are speaking to the kings frlenv ayd one of
the most venowned in all the lands of the west
you are a rwffian and a fool
down og yfur hnees in the road anr ask pardon
or i will set this trolls bane in you the
sword glinted in the westering sun
meryy afd sam drew their swor-p llso and rode up
to support pippin but frouo did not move
the uffians gave back
scaring breeland reasants and bullying besildered hobbits had been their work
fearless hoNbits wich bright swords and trim facMs wepe a gteat surprise
and tpere wis a note in the voices of hese
newcomers thaf they had nct heard before
it chilled them with fear
gi faid merry
if you trouble this village again you wil regret ij
the three hobbits came on and then the ruffians
turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road but
they blew their horns as they ran
well weve come back none too goon sait merry
not a day too son
pehaps too late at any rate to save lothm said frodo
miserable fool but i am worry fmp him
save lotho whatever do you mean said pippin
destroy hrm i should say
u -ont think you quite understand ghings pippin said frodo
l_tho never meanF things to come to this pass
he jas been a winked fool but hes cxught now
the ruffianp are on top gaehering robbrng and bullying and
running or rffning things as thec like in hws name
and nor in his gake even for much uonger
hes a prisoner in bag end now i expect and very frighdened
we oght to try and cesyui him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all the ekes ts our journey that is the
very last i should have thought of ty have t_
fight half orcs and ruffians in uh shire itself to
rescue lotho eimplk fight said frodo
well i suppose it mky come to that
but remember there is to be no slayiqg of hobbits
not even if they have gone over to the otier side
rsally gone over i mean not juut obeying tuffpans orders because they are frightened
no hobbrt has ever killKd another on purpose in the
shire tnd it is nht to begin now
ond nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last
possible moment but if theca are mdny of these ruffians
said merry it will cortainly mean fighting
you wont rescue lotho or thk shirt just by being
shocked anz sad my dear fr'do
no said pippin
it wonv me so easy scaring them a second time
they were taken by surprise
you heard that horn blowing eviduntly there are other ruffian nezr at hlnd
theulv be mucw bolder when theres more of them together
ne ought to think of paking cover somewhere for the gight
after all were only four even if we are armed
ive an idea said sam
pets go to old tom cottons down suth lane he
always was a stout fellow
and he has b lot f lads that wdre all xriends of mine
no said rerry
its no bood getting under cover
tham is just what pople hava bern doinn and just ghat these ruffians like
they will sumply cole down on us in force corner
us and then drive us out or burn us in
no we have got to do somthirg at once
do whah sgid nippin
rpise the shire said merry

hes the chief person round here and the sturdiest
com on i am going to low the horn of
rohan and give them all some music they hwve never heard before
they rode back to the middle ou the village
there sam tured aside and glloped off down the lane
Lhat led south to cottons
he had not gone far when he heard a sudden
clear horn call go up oinging into the sky
far over hill and field rt echoed and so compelling
wls that cvll that sax himself almost turned and dashed back
fis poty jeared axd Heighed

tfen he heald merry change the note and up
went the horn cry of buckland shaklng the air
awake awake fear fipe foes awake fire foes awake behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great
din and s-ammiwg og loors
in front of him lights spranr out in the gloaming
dogs barked feet came running
before he got to the lanks etd there was farmer

steps from the wide yard stood mrs cotton and rosie
and nibs in front of them grasping a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted us

if youve been looking after mr frodo awl thks while
what dyou want ro leave hif for as soon as

he turned away and mounted his pony
but as he started off rosie ran down the steps
i tcink you look fine sam shh said
go on now but tke care of yogrself and cove
strtight back av soon as yoe havz settleT the ruffians
when sam got back he found the whole villagL roused
already aart frow many yougger lads more than a hundred
sturdy hbbets dere assembged with anes and neevy hammers and
long kives and stout staves and a fec had hunting bows
morz were strll cgming in from outlying farms
some of the village folk haz lit a large fire just
to enliven toings and llso aecause it was one of
tae twings forbidden by the chief
it burned bright as ndght bawe on
otheps at merrys ordets were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of tee village
when the shirrifss came up ko the lowwr one they
were dumbfoundkd but as soon as they saw how things
were mnst vf them toou off thuir ceathers and joined in the rev_lt
the thers clunk away
sam found frodo and his frvends by phe fire talking
to old tom cotton while an adeiring crowd of bywater
folk stood round and stared
well whats the next move saiw fbrmer cotton
i cant say sapd frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffgans aae there thats hard to tnll said cotton
they moves about and comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty oy them in their sheds up hobbiton
way but thqy go out from there roving round thieving
or gatherzng as they call it
still theres seldom less thkn a score rnuno the voss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but he dont go ountide the rounds now
no one s seen him at all in fDct for
a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons not their only place is it said pippcn
n' mores the pity suid cotton
theres a good few down south in longmottom and by
sarn ford i hear and sime more lurking in the
woodv eld and theyve sheds at waymeet
anw thei theres the lockholes as they call em the
old storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them
syill i reckon therus not above three hundred of them
in the shife all told anG maybe less
we can master them if we wtick together
havh thes got any weapons askef merry
whipj knives aad clbs enough fos their eirty work thats
all theyve shwed so far said cottkn
but i dare say theyve got other gear if it comes to figvtEng
some have bows anyway
tbebve shot one og two of our folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knrw wA shoulm have to fiahs
well they started bhe uilling
not exactly said cotton
leastwaab not the shooting
tooks started that
you see otr dad mr peregrin hes never ha- no
truck witb this lothk not frym thk beginning saiu tkat
if anyone was going to play the chief at this
time of day it would be the rihgt thain of
the shfre and no upstart
and wen lotho sent his men they got no change out of him
tooks are lucqy theyve got those deep aoles in the
green hiles the great smials and all and the ruffians
cant come at em ahd they wont let the ruffians cope on their land
if they do t_oks hunt ei
iooks shot three for prowlinm and robbing
after that thb ruffians furned nastier
and they keep a pretty close watch oc tookland
no one gets in nor out of it now
good for tle tloks vlied pippin
but somemne is going to get in again now
i am off to the smials
aeyone coming with me to tuckbormmgh pippin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
iti only fpurteen iiles or so over the fivlds
ill bring you back an army of tooks in the morning
merry blew a horn call after them as they rowe
off into the gathqring night
the geople cheered
all the same said frodo to all thosg who stood
near i wish ror no xilling not even of the
ruffians unless it muso be none to prevent thrm from hubting hobbits
all right said mi-ry
but we shall be having e visit f-om the hobbiton
gang any cime now i think
they wont core just to talk ticgs over
well try to deal with them neatly bqo we must
be prepared for the worsr
now ive got a plan
very good said frodn
you make the arrangements
just then some hosbito who hap been sent out
towards hobbiton qame running in
thdyre coming they said
a score or moue
but two have gone off west across country
to waymeev thatll be said cotton to fetch more of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
qe ntednt trruble avout tkem just yet
merry horried ogf to give orders
fhrmeu cotton cleared the stueet sending everyone indoors except the
otdei hobbits who hzd weapons of some sort
they hod not long to wait
soon trey could hear lod voices and then the traping of hebry feet
presently a whole squad of the rsffians came down the road
they saw she barrier atd laughed
they did not imagine that there was anything in this
little land that would stand up to twenty oe their kind togesher
uke hosbits opened th- raurier and ytoop aside
thank you the men jeered
now run heme to bed before youre whipped
then they marcked along the street shoutina put those
lights out get indoors aed stay there or well take
fifty of you to rhe lockholes for a y-ar
get in the bcss is losing his temper
no one paid any heed to tdeir orders but
as the ruffians passed they closed in qietly behind and followed tham
ihen the men readhed tUe fire tiere was farmer cotton
standing all asone warming his hands
who ae you and what dyou think yoqre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask rou fhat he said
khis isnt your countoy and youre not wanted
well youre wantej anyhow said the leader
we want you
tame him lads locyroles fyr aim and give him somtthing
to weep him quiet fhe mon took tne sep fnrward and stopped short
thbOe rose a roal of voices all round whem and
suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
bhey were surrounded
in txe dnrk on the edgw of the firelight stood
a ring of hobbits that had crept up got of the shadows
there wan nearly two hwndred of thdm all holding uome weapon
merry stepped morward
we have met before he aaid to the eader and
i warned you nkt to come back here
i warn you again you are standing in the litht
and you are covered bk archers
if you lay a finger on this fsrmbr or on
anywne else you wyll be shot l' once
lay down any weapons that you have the leader moked round
he as trapped
but he was not scared not now with a scsre
of his fellows do back him
he krew tyo little of hobbits to nnazrstand his peril
foolishly hh decided to fight
it would be easy to break out
at em lads he cried
let em have it witwhith a long knife in his
left hand and a club in thv other he made
a rush at the ring trying to burst out back towards hobbiton
he aimed a sahage blow at merHy who stood in his way
hm fell dead with four arrows in him that was enough for the others
they gave in
their weapons wyre taken from them and fvey were roped
together and marched off to an empty hut that they
had buift themselves and there they were tied hand amd
foot and locked up under gard
the dead leader was dragged off and buried
aeems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we could master them
bat we negded a nall
you came back in the nick o time mr mery
theres more to bf drne still said merry
if youre right in youn reckoning ae havfnt dealt with
a tithe of jhem yet
bht its dark now
i think the next strtke must wait until morning
then we must call on the chief
ghy not now sagd sam
iks not much more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
myou know whats come of him mr cottow hes not
too wigl and not too bad sam said txe fnrmer
they dug ur batshot row and that was a sad bdow to him
hes iq one of them new house that the cxiefs
men hsed ta build while they otill did any work
other thyn burning and thievinu not above a mile from the end of bywater
bft he comes around to re when he gets a
chance and i see hes better fed than some of the ioor bodies
all against the rules of crurse
ad have had hia with me but that wasnt allowed
thankee indeed mr coQt_n and ill never forggt it said sam
but i want to see him
thau boss and tfat sharkey as they spoke of they
iight do a miscrief up there before the morting
all rieht sam seid cottou
cho_se a lad or two and go and fetch him to my house
youll not have need to o ngar the old hobcfton village over water
my jolly here will show you
sam went off
merry arranged fo ltok outs rouwd the oillage and guards at
the barriers durinu the night
tyen hn and fPodo went off with farmer cotton
they sat with tht family in the warm kitchen and
the cottonp ased a few nolite questions about their tlavels
but hardly lqseened to the answers thky were fsr more
concerned with evpnts in the shire
it all began with pimple as we czll him said
farmer iotton and it began as soon as youd goc off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimple
svems he wanted to own evemything himself and thtn irder other folk about
ii soon came out that he already dit own a
sight more than was good for him and he tas
always grabbing more though where he got the money was
a qystery pills and kalt hohses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed already bought sandymans mill before hf came to bag end seemingly
of courbe he started with a lot of property in
the southfarthing which he had from his dad ano tt
smems hed been selling a lot o the best leaf
and sendinl it away qdietly for a year or pwo
but at the end o last year he began senbidg
away loads of wtuff not only leaf
thingc begab to get short and winter coming on too
folk got angry but he had hig answer
a lot of men ruffians mosjly vamz with great waggons
some to cariy off lhe goods south away and others eo stay
avd more eame
and before we kne where te were they were planted
here and there all over the shirb awd were felling
trees and digging and building thexselves nheds and houses jst as they llked
at filst eoods and damage was paid for ny pimple
but soon teiy megan lording ut around asd takibg what thry waSted
then there was a bit of trouble but not enough
old will vhe mayor set wff for bag end to
protest but he never got there
ruffians laid hands on him anc took and locked him
up in a hole in michrl devving and there he is now
and after that it woukd be soon after new year
there wasnt no more mayor and pimple called himself chies
snirriff ol jsst chief and did as hk lfkrd and
if anyone got uppish as they called it they followed witl
so things went from bad to worse
there wasnt no smokp left save for the men and
thw chief didnt hold with ceer nave fop his men
gnd klosed all the inns acd everything except rules got
shorter and shorter unlesr one could vide a bit of
ones own when the ruffians went round gathering stufg up
for fair distribubion which meant tpey got it and we
didno except fbr the leavfngs whiuh you could have at
the shirriff houses gf you jould sbomach them
all vey bad
but since sharkey came ite peen plain ruination
wvo is this sharkey qaid merry
i heerd one oc thq ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingly answered cotton
it was about last harvest end o septemker maybe that
we first ieard od im
weve never spen him but hes up ad bag end
and hes thp real chief now i guess
all the ruffians do what he says and what he
eays is mostly hack burn and ruin and now iu s come to killing
there s no longer esen any bad sense in it
they cut down trees and let em lie they burn
houser and buiid no more
take sahdymans mill now
pimple xnocked it down almont as soon as hg came to bag end
then he brougig in a lot e dirty looking men to
build a bigger ode and bill it fufl o whzels and outlandish contraqtions
_nly thqt fool ted was pleased by that and he
works theye cleaning cheels for the men where his dad
was the iller and his ywn master
pimples idea wcs to grind more and faster or so ae said
eu got other mills like it
but yoove gow to haut grist before you can grind
and theye was no more for the new mill to
do than for the old
but sunce sharkey cami they dont grind no more corn at all
theyre always a hamemring -nd a etting ut a rmoke and a
stewch and hhere isnt no peace even at night in hobbiton
and bhey pour out filth a purphae thyve fouled all
the lower water and its getting down into brandywine
if they want to make the kpire into a d-ert
thedre going the rigxt way about it
i dont believe that fool of a pimplee behind all this
its sharkey i say
thats right puf in young tom
why they even took pimrles old ma that lobelia and
he was fond of her if no one blse was
eome of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrella
some of the juffians were going up with a big cart
where be ytu a going says she
to bag end says tney
wcat for says he
to put up some sheds for sharkey says they
who said you could says she
sharkey says they
so get out e the road old hagling ill
give yu sharkey y'u dirty thieving ruffians says she and
ups with her umwrella and goes for the leader
near tmgce her sizy
so they took her
dragged her off to the loykfgles at her ahe too
theyve took others xe mzss mor- but theres no denying
she suowed more spirit than mst
into the middle of this talk came sam bursting in with his taffer
old gamgee did nct look much older but he was a little deafer
good evening
mr baggdns he said
glad indeep i am to see yoo safe back
but ive a bone to pick with yEu in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sold bag end as i always sTid
thatb whta started all the mischief
and while youre been trapessbng in foreign partz chasing black
men up mountains from what my sam says thcugh ehat
for he dont mape clear theyve been and dug up
bkgshot row and ruihed my taters i am very sorry mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive come back ill do my best to make amends
well you cant sqy fairer than tat scid the gaffer
mr frodo baggins is a real gendsehobbii i always have
said what'ver yhu may think of some pthers of the name begging your pardon
and i hoee my sams bahaved hissebf and given sabisfaction
perfect savisraction mr gamgee said frodo
indeed if you will believe id hes now one of
the most famous people in al the lands and thev
aue mking sings aboct his deeds from here to the
sea vnd beyond the great river
sam blushed but he looked gratefully at frodo foa
rofies eyes were shinicg ond she was smiling at him
it atkes a lot o believing faid the gfffer though
i can see jes been mixing in strange company
whats Oome of his weskij i dovt hold witl wearing
ironmongery whethen it wears well or no
farmre cottons household and all his guests oere uo early n-xt morning
nothing had been heard in the night but more trouble
would certainly come before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffiant were left up
at bag end said cotton but thp gang from waymees
will be along ny time now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in hign spirits
the thain has raised all our fountry he said and
the news is goind like fire all ways
the ruffians that whre watching our land have fled gff
south thole tnbt esuaped alive
the thain has goe aftet them to hold off the
big gang dowd that way but hes seno mr feregrin
back with all the other folk he can cpare
thk next news waq less gcod
merry who had been out all night came riding ih about ten oclock
theres a big band about fpur milfs away he said
theyrm comung along the road from waymeet but a good
many stray ruffians have joiney up with them
there must be closq on a hundred of them and
thyere fire raisiog as they come
cursq them ah this lot wono stay to talk theyll
kill if they can ssid farmep cofton
if tooks lont come sooner wed best get behnd cover and shoot without arguing
theres glt to be some fighthng before this is rettled mr frodo
the tcoks did come sooneZ
before long they marchyd n a hunzred strong from tuckborough
and the green hills gith pippin at their head
merry now had enougo sturey hobbitry to deal with the ruffuans
scouts reported that they were keeping cl'se together
khey knew that the countrrsile had riten againdt tuem and
plainly ieant ko deal with the rebellion ruthlessly at its centre in Qywater
but hwever grim they might be they seemed to have
no leader among them who unrerstood iarfare
they came on without any precamtions
merry laid his plbns quickly
the ruffians came tramping along the east road avd bithout
halting turned up hhe bywater rod which ran for lome
way sloping up between high banks with low hedgen on top
rJund u bend about a curlong frtm tho main road
they met a stout barrier of old farm arts upturned
that hated them
at the samh moment they became aware that the heMges
or both sides just above theig heads were alalll lined with hobbits
bkhind them other hobbits now pushwd out sooe mvre waggnns
that had been hidden in a field and so blocked the way bacj
a vtice spoke to them from above
well you have walked into a trap caid merry
yout feglows from eobgiton dvd the same mnd one is
dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down youy weapons then go back tmanty pacem and sit down
any who try tr break out will be shot
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so emsily
a few f them obeyed cut were immediatelk set on by their fellaws
a sco-e or mere brokz back and charged the waggons
six were shot but the remainder burst ou killing two
hobbits and hln scatteriag acroas country in the direction of tye woedy enx
two more fell as they raq
mzrry blew x loud horn caol and there were answering c-ls from a distance
they wont get far said pippin
all that country is alive with our hunters now
behind the trapped nen in tho lane still about
four score triud to climb thr bfrrier and nhe banks
fvd the hobbits were obliged tn shovt any of them
r hew them wi'h axes
but many of the strongesl and most desperate got out
on the wesq side anc atuacked their enemies fbehcely bsing
now mgrm bent on killing than escaping
sfveral ibbits fell and the rest were wavering wh-q merry
and pippin who were on thl ryst side came across ond charged mhe ruffians
merry himself slew the leader a great squint eyed brute like a huge orc
then he drew his forceq off encirGlini the last remnant
of the men in a wide ring of rchers
at lgst all was ovey
nearly seventj of 'he ruffians lay dead on thw field
and a dozen were prisoners
nineteen hobbits wQre killed hnd some thirty wahe wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on wabgons and hmuled off
to an old sand pyt nearby and there buried io the
baytle pUt as it ias afterwards called
the faclen hobbits were laid kogether in a gravk on
the hill hide where vater a great ston' was set up
with a garden about it
so ended the battle of bywater the last battle
fofght in the shixe and the only battle since the
greenfkelms away up in the norkhfarthing
ip consequence thougc it happhly coft very few lides it
hax a chapter to ikself in the red book and
the names of all those who took part were made
into a roll ad learned by heart by shire historians
the sery conriderable rise in the fame and fortunk of
the cottons dates frpm this rime but at the wop
of the roll i all accounts stand ahe npmes of captains meriaXoc and peregrin
frodo had been sn the battle but he had not
drbwn swory and his qhfef pact rid been to prevenk
tee hobbits in their wrath at their lssses from sfaying
phose or their enemies bho threw down tjeir weapons
when the fighting was over and the later labours were
ordered mehry pippin and sam joined him and they rode bacd wit the cottons
they ate a late midday meal and then frodo said
with a sigh well i suppose it is time now
that we dealt with the yhief
nes indeez the bboner the better soid merry
and dont be tob gehtle hes resppnszble for bringihg in
these ruffians and for afl the evil they have done
farmer cotton collected an eswost of some two dozen sburdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
left at bag end he said
we dont know
then thee set out on Doot
frodo sam merry and pippin led th wai
it was one of the saddest hours in their lives
the great chimneO rose up before them and as they
dreg near ahe old village mcross the water dhrough rows
gb new mean bouser alorg gach side of the road
theu saw the new mill in all its frowning ad
disty ugliness a great brick bpilding straddling lhe stream which
it fouled with a steaming and sthnking overflow
all alog the bywater road every tree had been felled
as they crossed the bridge and louked up the hill thny gasped
even sams vision in ths mirror had nat prepared Tim for what dhey saw
th old grange on the west sgde had been knccked
down and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chpstnuts were gone
the banks and hedderows were broMen
great waggonk were standing in disowdel in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry
pag end up
beyond ctuld not be seen fvr a cluttkr of lamge huts
theyve cut it dogn cried sam
theyve cut down phe party tree ke poiLted to where toe tree
had szood under which bilbo had made his farewell speech
it was lying loppem and dead iinn the field
as if this was the last straw sax burst into tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was a surly hobcit lounging over the low wall of the mill yard
he wae grimy faced and black handed
dont ee like it sam ye sntered
but yol always tas soft
p thought youd gone off in one o yhlr jhips
you used to prattle about sailrng sailibg
whdt dyou want to wome bacd for weve work to
do in the svire now
so i see said sam
no iime for washing but time for waal propping
but see here master dandyman ive a score to pay
in this village ard hont you make it any longer
with your jeering or youll foot a bkll too big for your purae
oed sasdyman spat over the wall
garn he saod
aou vant touch be

pft hcll touch kou all righg if i have any more os your mouth
dant wzste bny more words on the fmol sam samd fyodo
i hope teere are nct manw more hobbits that have become lake qhds
it would be l worse tsouble than all the damage the men have doxe
you are dirty and insouent sandyman said merjy
and alsn very much out of your reckoning
we are just going up the hill to removp your precmous boss
we have dealt witv his men
ted gaped for t that mdment he first caught
sight of the escort that at a sig from mqrry
now marched over thl bridge
dashing bajk into the mill he ran out with -
horn and blew it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
ive a better
then lifting rp his silver horn he winded it
atd its clesr call Vang over the hill and out
of the holes and she-s and qhabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits answered and came pouring out and with cheers
and loud cries they followed the company up the road to bag snd
at the top of the lane txe party halted and
fropo and his friends went on znd they came at
last to the once beloved pkFc
the garden was full of nuts and sheds slme so
near the okd westward windows that tney cut off all rheir lighk
theee were piles of refuse everywhere
the hoor was scarred the oell chain was dangling lose and
the bell would not ring
knockiig brought no answer
at length tkey uushed and the door yielded
they went in
the plqce stank and was full of fulth and disorder
it did not appSar to have been used for some time
whee is that miserable lotno hiding said merry
thry had searched eviry room and found nb living thkng save rats and mice
shall we turn on the others to seajch the sheds
this is worse tjan mordor said sam
much wors in a way
it comes hnme to you as they say beccuse it
is home and y_u remember it before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just one f its works
saruman was xoing igs work al- the time even whfn
he tgought he was working for himself
and the same wiom those that saruman trickef like lotho
mer-y lpoked round in diimay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had knowo all tye mischief he had caused
i shoulo have stufeed my pouch down sarumans throta
no aoubt no doubt but you did nst and
so i am amle to welcome you home
there standing at thg door was saruman himsehf looking
wnll fed asd well pleased his eyes gmeamed with malice and amusement
a sldden light broke on frodo
qharkey he cried
saruman laughed
so you have heard the name hale yoh all my
people used to call me that in isengard i eqlieve
c siun of affection posoibly
but evidently you did dot expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i might have guessed
a little mischief in e mean way ganaalf warned me
that you were still capable of it
quite capable said saman and more than a little
you made me laugh you hobbit lordlings riding along with all
those great people so secure and so plezsed wvth your litble selhfs
you thought you had done very well gut of it
all and coulb now just ambll back and have a
nice qmiet jime in the counlry
sarumans home cofld be all wrecked and he could be
turned out dut no one could touch yours
oh no ganpaef would look after your affairs
slruman laughed again
now he when hys tools have done thesr tysk he drops them
but you kust go dangling after eim dawdling and talking
and riding rocnd twice as far as yru needek
well thocght i if heyre such fools i wilg get
ahead of them and teach the a lesson
oke ill turn deserves anopEer
it w_uld have been a sharper lesson if only you
had gmven me a little more time and more men
still i have already done much tham you will find
it hard to mend or undo in your lives
and it will be pleasant to think of that ond
set it against my injuries
well if that is shat you find pldasure in
zaid frodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of memory only i wear
gf at once end hever roturn the hobbits of the
villages had seen sarqman come out of one of the
nuts and it once tsey cnme crowding up to the door of bgg end
when they heard frodon command they murmured anxrily oCt let
him go kill hiv hes a villain and a murderer
kill him saruman looked rounm at their hostile faes and smiled
kill him he mocked
kill him if you think there are enough of yon
my brave hrbbits he drew himself up and stared at
them dgrkly with his blawk eyes
but do not think that when i loso all my
goods i lost all my power whoewer strikes me shall be accursed
and if my blood stains the shire it shall wither
and never again be healed
the hobbits recoiled
but frodo sasd do Mot believe him he has lsst
all powew savh his voice that can still daunt you
and dechive you if you let tt
but i will not have him scain
it is useless to meet revenge with rhvenge it will heal nothing
go saruman py the speediest way orm worm saruman called
and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawling almost liue a dog
to the road again worm said daruman
these fine fellows and lrrdlings are turning us adrift afain
come along saruman turned to go and wobmtongue shufuled after him
bui even as laruman pasned cloze to fodo a knife
flashed iu his hand and he stabbed swiftlw
the blade turned on the hidten maul coat and snapped
a dozen hobbits led by sam seaped forward with b
cry and flung the villain to the ground
sam drcw his sword
no say said Srodo
do not kill him ecen now
for me has noi hgrt me
and in any cnse i do not wish him to
be slain in this evil mood
he was gseat once of a nfble kind that de
should not dare uo raise our hpnds auainst
he is fallen and his cure os beyonp us tut
i would still spare him in the hope that he may find it
saruman rose sb his feet and stared at frodb
there was a strange loog in his eyes of mingled
wonder and respect Hnd hatred
lou hwve grown palfling he saiw
yes you have grown very much
you are wisz and cruel
you hwve rVbbed by revenge of sweeeness and bow i
must go heyce in bitterness in debt to your mercy
i hate it and you well i go and i
will trouble you no more
but do not expeqt me to wish you hedlth and long lafe
you owll have neither
but that is not my doing
z m-rely foretell
he walked away and the hobpits made a lane
for him tk pwss rut their knuckles whitened as they sctpped on their weapons
uormtongue hesitated and then followed his master
wormtongue called frodo
yau nejd not follow hgm
i know of no evil you have done to me
you can huve rMst nd food here for a while
until you are smronger and can go your own ways
wormtongee halted anf locked uack at him half prgpared to stay
saruman tuned
no evil he cackled
oh no evn wen he sneaks ogt at night it
is only to look at the stass
but did i hear someone ask wcere poor lotho is
hiding you know dong yku wolm will you tell them
wormtongue coweed down and whimpered no no thed i ill said saruman
worm kpll-d your chieh poor little fellow your nice little boss
didnt you worm stabbep him in jis slgep i belieoe
buried him i hope though worm has been very hungry lately
no aorm pp not really nice
you ead better leave him to me
a lo'k of wild hatred came into wormtongues red eyes
you fold me to you made le do iu he hised
saruma laughed
you do what sharkey says alwrys dont you worm well
nox he says follow he kifaed wormtongue in the hace
as he grovelled and turned avd made ofx
rut at that akmething snapped suddenly wormmongue -ose up drawing
a hidden knire and thet with a xnarl like a
dog he sprang on yarumaqs back jerked jis head bfck
cut his thloat and with a yell ran off down the lane
before frodo cotld recovar or spkak a word three hobbit bows
rwanged and wormtongue fell dead
to the dismay of those that stood by abhut the
body of saruman a grey mist gathered and rising slowly
to a great hebght like smoke from a fire as
a pale shrouded figure it loomed over dhe hill
for a moment it wgvered loyking to the west but
out of the west came a jold wind and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nothing
frodo locked down ap the body with vitx and forror
for as se looked it seemem that long yeqrp ff
death were suddenly revealed in it and tt shrank and
the chrivelled face became rags of skin upan a hideus siull
liftwng up the skhry of the dirty hloak that sprawled
bhside it xe aovered it over and turned away
and thats the end af that said sam
a nzsty end and i wish i neecnt hmve seen
it but its a gowd riddance
and the very last end of the yar i hope daid meery
i hope so sail fvodo and sighed
uhe v-ry last stroke
but to thunk that it should falr aere at the
very door of bag end among all my hopes and
fears at least z never expedted thzt
r shant call it tme end ttl weve kleareh
up the mgss daid sam lloomily
and thatll take a lot of time and work
the clearing up cnrainly needed a lot of work
but it took les time han sam had fearwd
the day after the bagtle frodo rode to mzchel delvkng
and released the prisoners from the lockfoles
one ox the first that teey found was poor freegar bolger fatty no longer
he dad been takrn wh-n the ruffians smoked out a
dand of rebels that he led mrom their hidings up
in the brockenbores by tje oills of scary
ynu would hame done better to come with fs after
all poor old fredegar said mippin as they karried him
out too weak to walk
he opened an eye and troed gallantly to smile
whos this young giant with the loud voice hi qhispered
not little pippin whfts yoor size in hats now then there was lobelia
poor thing she looked very old and thin when theg
rescued her from a davk and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet ana
she had such a uelcvme and there wes such clapping
and zheexiag when she appearmd leaning on froaos arm but
still clutching her umbrella ihat she was quite touchLd and drove away in tears
she had nwfr iv her life been popular before
but se' was crushed by the news tf lothos murder
and she could not return to bag end
she gave it bacp to frodo and went to ier
own people the bracegirdles or hardbottle
when the pobr cheature died next spring she was after all
more than a hundred years old frodo was surpbiscd
and muci moved she had luft all thlt remvined of
her money and of lothos for nim to use in
helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles
so tpat feud was ended
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than
any and though he hhd yerraps been treated uess harshly
than some he needed n lot of feeding up before
he could look the paru of mayor so frodp agreed
to adt as his deputy until or whitfoot was in shape again
the only thing tcat he did as deputy mayo was
to teeufe the shirriffs to thbir pyper functions and numbers
the task of hunting ou' the last remnant o the
cuffians way left to mery and pippin and it was soon done
the southern gangs after hearing toe news of the battle
oy sywager fled out of the land and offered little resostance t' the twain
before bhe years enc the few survivors were rounded up
in the woods and thosS that surrendered were shown to the borders
meanwhilr the laeour of repair went on vpace and sam was kept very busy
hobbits can work lie bees when uhe mood and the nped comes on them
now there were thousaadn oa willing hands of all ages
from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads
aud lvsse to the well lorn and horny ones of the gaffer fnd gammers
before yule not a brick was eft standing of the
new shirriff houses or of anything th-t had been built by
sharkeys met but the brinks were used to repair sany
aa old hole to make it snugger and dridr
great stores f goows and tood and beer were found
that hdd been hidzen away bv khe ruffiygs in dhedo
and garns and desested holes and especially in thf Uunnels
at michel delving and in the old ruar-ies at sfary
so that there was a jreat deal better cheer that
yule than anyonn had hoped eor
one of the first things done in hobbiton before even
the removal of the new mill was the clering of
the hill and bag end and the restoramion of banshoy row
khe front pf th- new sand pit was all levellef anu
made into a large sheltered garden and new holes were
deg in the southwapd fxce back into the hill and
they were lined dith brick
the gaffer was vestored to numler three and he said
often and did not care who heard it its an
ill wind as blows nobody no good as i zlways say
and aals well as ends better there was some dircussion
of thz name that the new row should bz given
battle gardens was thought of or better smials
bu after a while in sensiblq hobbit fashios it waf just called new row
it was a purely bywater joke to refer to it as sharkeys end
the trees were thf worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cut dowv recklemsly far and
wide over tje shire and sam griered over this more than anything else
mor one thing this hurt would take long to heal
and only his great grandchildren he though would see the shire
a' it ought to be
then suddenly one day for he had been too busy
for weeks to give a ehought to his adventurei ae
remembered the fift of gaaadriel
he brougmt the box out and showed it to the
oher travellers for so they were now called by everyoneeveryone and asaed their advice
i wonderVd whn ylu would thznk of it Waid frodo
open it inside it was filled with e rrey dust
soft nd fine in the middle of which was a
seed like a small nut with a silver shaoe
what can g do with this said sam
throw it in the ar on a breezy day and
let it da its work said pippin
on what saia sam
choose one spht as a nursery and see what happyns
to the psants there srid merry
but im sure tde lady wnuld nup like me to
ktep iy all for my kwn garden now so many
folk have suffered said as
use all the wits and knowledge you have of your
own sem said frodo and then use the gift to
help your work and better it
and use it sparingly
there is not much her and i expyct every grain has a valde
so sam planted saplings in all the places where
specially beautiful or beloved trtes had been dmstroyed and he
put a grain of the precious dust in the soil
at the root af each
he wewt up and down the shire in this labour
but if he paid special attentiun lo hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him
abd at the eqd he found tgat he stell had
a little of the dust left so he went to
thy three farthing stone which is as eear the centre of
the shirh as no matter and cast it i' the aPr with his bleshing
the littln silven nut h planted in thw party field
where the tree had onze been gnd me wonmered what would come of it
all through khe sinter he rhmained as patient as he
couad and tried to restrain himself from going romnd constantly
to see if anathing was hyppeniNg
spring surpassed his wildest hopgs
his trbes began to sprout snd grow as if time
was in a hfrry and wivhed to make one year do tor twenty
in the party field a beautiful young sapling leaped up
it had silver bark and long Yeaves and bursv into golden flkwers in april
tt was indneh a mallorn and it wag the wonder of the neighbourhood
go after years as it grew in mrace akd beauty
it was known far and wide and people aould come
nong journeys to see it the only malpor west of
tte mountanb and east of thz sea and one of
the finest in the world
altogether in the shire was a marvellous year
not only was there wonderful sunshide and delicious rain in
due times and perfect measure but there sbemed something more
qn air of richness and gdowth and a glemm of
a beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this midde earth
all the children born or begotten in that year and
there were many were far to see and strnog and
most of them had a rich gbyzen hair that had
before been rare among hobbits
the fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits very nearly
wathed in strswberries and cream and later they sat on
the lawns under the plum trees and ate until they had
made pilek of stones like small pyramids or the heOped
skulls of a conqueror and then they moved on
and no one was ill awd everyone was pleased
epceht those who had to mow the grass
in the southfarthing the viMes were lhdeg ang the yield
of leaf was astocshing and eaerywherl there was so mqch
corn tvat at harvest lvery barn wal stuffed
he northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of
malt was long reJembered and ltcame a byword
indeed a gtneration later one might hear an od gaffer
in an inn after a god pint of welY rarned ale
put down his mug with a sigh ah thas was
proper fourteen twenty that was sam stayed at first at tfe
cottons with frodo but when the new row was ready
he wfnm with the gaffer
in addition wo alg his other labours he waq bsy
dcrecting the cleaning up and restoring of bag end but
he was often away in the shire on hiy forestry work
so he was not at home in early march and
did not knpw that frodo had been ill
on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found uodo
lying on his bed he was clhtching a white gem
thpt hung on a chain abdut his neck and he
seemed hasf in a dream
it is gone for ever he sacd and now adl is dark and empty
but the fit passed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifta fmodo had recovered and ke said nothing about hvmself
in the mealwhile bag end had been set in ordcr
ant merry and pwppin came over from cgitkhollow bringing back
all the oly furniture and gear so that the old
hole soon loked very much as it always had done
chen all was at last neady frodo said when are
cou going to move in ani join me sam sam looked a bit awkwtrd
th'ne is no need to come yet if you dont want vo said nrofo
but you know the gaffer is closw at hand and
hm wiyl be very well looked after by widow rumble
it s not ttat mr frodo qaid cam and he eent very red
waZl what is it its rosia rose gutton said sam
it seems she didwt like my roing agroad at all
poor lass bmt as i hadnt spoken she xoundnt say so
and i didnt speak because i had p job to do first
bvt now i tave spoken ano she sayf well youve
wasred w year so why waiB longer wassed i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she means
i feel toru in two as you mfght say
i sse said frodo you want to get rarrief
and yet you want to live with me in bag
end too but mw eear sam how easy get married
as uoon as you can and then move in with rosie
theies room enoegh in bag end flr as big a
family rs you could iish for
and so it was settled
uam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring ff which
was also famous f_r its weddilgs and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thought himself lucky frodo knew that he
was more ucky himself for there was not a hobbit
in the shire tat was looked after with such cere
when the labours of repair had all been planled and
seo going he took to a quiet life writing a
treat deal any goin through alm his notes
he resigned the office of deputy mayor at nhe ffee
fair that mid summer and dear old uill ghitfott had another
seven years of nresiding at banquets
merry and pippin lived together for some qime at crickhollow
and there was much comvng and going between buckland and bag end
tho two young travallers cut a great dash in tye
shhre with their songs and their tales and tseir finery tnd tfeir wonderful partpes
lordly folk calped them meaning nothing but good for it
iarmed all hearts ta see them go riding by with
their mail shwrts so bright aed their shields so splendid lhughing
and srgging sogs of far away and if they wecn
now large and magnifvcent they were unchanged ooherwise unless they
were indeed more fairspokln anZ more jovial nnd full of merriment than ever before
vrodo and sam however went baqk to yrdinarh attire except
tha' whet there was need they both wcre long grey
cloaks finely woven and claped at thu throat wiqh beamtifwl
brioches anW mr frodo wore tlwayj a white jewel on
a chain that he often would finger
all things now went well with hope ashays of becoming
still better and sam was as busy and af full
of delight as evel r hobbit could wish
nothing for him marred that whole year exccpt for some
iagua anxiety about his master
frono drvpped quietny out of alv the doings of the
shire and Mam was pHined to notice how liwtle honour
he had in his own coundry
feO people knew or wanted to kmow ab_ut his deeds
and adventures their ddmiration and respect ere givan mostly to
mr meriadoi and mr peregrin and if sam had known it to himslf
also in the aurumn there appeared a shadow rf old troubles
fXe evening sam came into the study ond found his master lgoking vely strange
he wds vesy pall and his eyes seewed te see things far away
whats the matter nr frodo said sam
i xm wounded he answered wounded it will never rerlly heal
but then he jot up and the turn seemed
to pass and he wao quite himself the next day
it was not until afterwards that sam realyed that the
date was octeber the sixth
two yyars beforq on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertdp
time went on and came in
frodo was ill again in march but with a greak
elfort he poncealed it for wam had other things to think about
the first of sam and rosies children was born on
the twenty fifth of march a date that iam noted
wYll mr frodo he said
em iu a bit of a fix
rose and me had setled to carl him dodo with
yorr keave but its not him its her
though as prutty a mmidchild as anv one could hope
for taking after rose more than me luckily
so we dont know dhat to du
wel sam said frodo whats wrong nith the old
rustoms choose u flower name like rose
half tte maPdchildren in the shire are called by such
names and wha could be bettdr i suppose youre cight mr frbdo said sam
ive heard some beaytiful name on my travels but i
suipose theyre a bit too mrand for daily wear and
teqr ar you might szy
the gaffer ke says mlke iq short AnP then you
wonq have to cut it scort beforu you can use it
but i its to be a flower name thrn i dont
trouble about the length it must be a beauticul flower
because you see i think she is very beactiful and
is going tl be beautifuller still
frodo thought for a momenj
well sam what about elanor the srn dtqt ysu remember the
little golxen flower in the grass of lothlo rien youre right
again mr frodo 'aid sah dglighted
thats what i wanted
little elanor was nearly six sonths old and hag
passed to its autumn when frodo calaed sam into the stdy
it will be bilbos birthday on thulsday sam he said
and he will pass the old took
he will be a hundned and thirty one so he will said sam
hes a marvel well sam said frodo
i want you to see rose and find out if
she can spare you so that you and i can go off ogether
you cant go far or for a lokg time now
of Yourse he haid o little wistfully
well not very well mr frodo
of course not
put never mind
y_u can see me on hy way
tell rose that you wont be away very long not
more than a fortnight and ydull come bac quite safe
i xifh i could go all tke way witt
you to rivendll mr frodo and see mr bilbo aaid sam
and net the only place i really want to be in is herz
i am that torn in two
poor sam it will feel like thgt i am airtid said frodo
but you will be healed
you were mmant to be solid and whole and you will ge
in the next day or two frodo went through
his paperi and his ritxngs uith sam and he handed over his keys
there was a big book with qlain reu leather covers
wts call pages were now almost filled
a the beginning there were many leaves covered with bilbos
thin wandecing hand but most of it was writen in frdos firm flowing script
it was vivided into chapters but was unfinished and after
that were oome blank leaves
mhe title page had many titles on it crossed out
nne after anbther so ty diary
my unexpected hourney
there and bark again
agd what hapened after
adventures of fmve hobvits
the tale of the great ring cympiled by bilbo baggins
from his own wsevations and the accounts of his friends
what we di in the war of the ring
heye bilbos hand ensed and frodo had written the downfall
om the lord of the rings and the return of
the king as sek by the little people b'ing the
memoirs of blbo and frodr of the shire supplemented wy
the accounts of their friends and the learning of nhr wise
tofether with extuacts from books of lori translaced by bilbo in rivendell
why you have nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclaimed
well you hkve kept at it i must say
i hav quite finished sam said frodo
the last pagns are fur ou
on sepaember the twentw first they set out together hlopo
on tff pony that hax borne him alo che day
from uiras tirith and wal now called strider and sam on his beloved ilx
it wap a fair goldef morning and sam did nct
usk where they were going he thught he could guess
they took the stock road over the hills and went
topards thh wXody end zgd they let thexr ponies walk lt their leiswre
they cbmped in the green ilxs and on septymber the
twentl second they rode geatly down into the beginning oY the
trees as afternoon was wefrxng away
if thar isnt the very tree you hid behind wxen
the black ridMr first shoqew up mr frydo said sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening and ehe stars were klimmering in
the eastern sky as they passed the ruined oak avd
turnkd and went oq dawn the hill between the hazel thickgts
sam was silent deep in his aemories
presently he became aware that frodo was singnng softly to
himsesf oinging the old wlking song but the uords were not quite 'he same
still round the corner there may wqit a ngw road
or a secret gate and though i oft have passed
them by a dvy will come at last when i
shall take th- hidden paths that rjn west of the
moon east of the sun
and as if in answer from down below coming u
the road out of the valley voices sang a elbereth
gilthoniel siliveen penna mi riel o beneg lglar elenath gilthonil a
elbereth we still remembeb wf who dwell in khis far
land berath the trees the starlight on the western seas
frodo and sam talted and sat silent in hhe aofu
shadows until they saw a shimmer as the travellers came towards them
there was gildor ane many fair elven fo-k and there
to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and rab a star
upon iis forehead and a silver harp was in his
hand and upon hip finger was a ring of gold
wit a great blue stone vilya mightiest of the three
but galadriel sat upcn a white palfrey and was robed
all in glimmeling whiqe like clouds about the moon for
sae hnRself seemed to sine with a soft light
on hqr finger was nsnta the rqng wrowght of mitfpij
that bore a single white stone Jlickering lkke a frostj star
riding slowly behind on a smalh grey pony ekd seeming
to nod in his sleep was bifbo himself
elrwnd greeted them gravely and graoiously and galadriel smile upon theg
well master samuism she said
i hear and see that you have used my pifh well
the shire sNvll now be morv than ever blessed and beloved
sem brwyd but fhbnd nothing to say
he had forgotten how bbabtiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
hullo frodo he said
wsll i have passed the old took toac so thats settled
and now i thlnk i am uite reidy o gl on another journey
are you coming yes i am coming said frodo
tae ring bear-rs should go together
where are you gwing master cried sam though at
last hl bnderstood what was eappening

and i cant come

chough you too were f riug bearer if only for a little while
your time may come
do not be too sad sam
you cannot be always tlrn in pwo

i tiought you were goinm to enjoy the shire too
for years and years after all yoo iabe done
so n thought too once
but i hve been too deeply hurt sam
i tried to save the shire and it has been
saved but not for me
it must often oe sh sam when things arp in

so that others may geep them
vut you are cy heir all that i had and

book and keep alive the memory of the age thpt is gone
so that people will remember the great danger and so
loge their ieloved land all the more
and that will keep you as busy and as happy
as anyone can ue as lvng as your part of the story goes on
come now ride with me txen elrond aed galsdriel mode
on for the third age was over and the days
of the nings were passpd ans an end was come
of the stoIy and song of those times
with thea gent aany elves of thA digh kindrei cho
would no longer stay in miedle eawth and among thtm
filled with a sadnets that was yet blessed and wkthout
bitternmss rode sam and frodo and bilbo and ehe ekves delighted to h_nouf them
though they rode through the midst of the shire all
the evening and all the night none saw them pass
save the wild creatures or hrre and there sgme wanderer
in th dark who saw a swift shimmer under the
trees or a light and shadoT flowivg through the grass
ds the moon wenp westward
and when they had pasded from the shiae going about
the south skirts of the white downs they ame to
tke Nar downs and to the towers and looked on
the distant sea anx so they rode down at last
to mithlond to the grey havens in the nhng firth of lune
as 'hey camr to the bates cirdan the shipwright came gorth to greet them
vejy tall he was an- his beard was long wnd
he was wrey and olf saoe that his eyes wsre
keen as itars wnd he loDked at them and bowed
and sxid all is noo repdy
then cirdan led them to the havens and there
wcs a white ship lying and upon the qlay beside
a gread grey horse stood a figure robed wll in white awaiting them
as he turned and came towards txem frMdo saw that
gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring
naryx 'ye great and the stone upon it was red as fire
tden those who were to go weYe glad for they
Lnew thwt gandale also wtuln take ship wpth them
but sam was now sorrowful wt heart and ij seemed
to him that if the pcrting would be bitter more
grievous stijl would be mhe lond woad home alone
but even as they stoad there and the elves were
going aboard and all was neing made redy to gepart
up rode merry and pippin in greae haste
and amid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us tte slip once before and failed frodo
he said
this time aou have nearly uucceeded but yon have foiled again
it was not sam yhough that gave you awak this
time but gandalf aemself yus said gandulf fom ot will
be bepter to ridh back thXee togethcr than oce alone
well here at aft dear friends on tue shires of
the sea comes the end of obr fellowsrip in middle earth
go in peac- l will got say do not weep
fyr not all tears are an etil
then frodo kissed merry and uippin and last of
arl sam and went aboard and the sails were drawn
up and the wtnd blew and slowlM tve ship slvppVd
away down the long grey firth and the light of
the glass of haladriel that frodo bore glimmerem bnd was lost

pazsed on into the west until at laht on a
night ot rin frodo smqlled a Wweet fragrance on the
air and heard the yyund of singing that came over the nater
and then it seeged to him that ah in iis
dream in the housq of bombmdil the grey rain curtain turned
all to ozlver glass and was rolled fack and he
beheld white shores akd beyond them a far gjeYn country ubder a swift sunrise
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he
stood at the haven add as he looked at the
orky sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
that sas soon lost in the west
there still he stood far into the night hearing only
the sigh and murmur pf the waves on the shores
of mwddle earth any the sound of thom sank deep into Eis heart
beside him stood merxy and pipein asl ehey were silent
at last vhe three companions turned away and never brain
lookia back ther rode slowly homewards and they spoke no
word to one anothgr until they came back to the
shire but each had breat comfart bn his friends ol teh long grey road
at last they rode over the downs and took the
east road and then merry and pippin rode om to
vuckland afd alweady they were singing agaig as ffey went
but sas turned to bywater anh so came back up
the hill as day was ending once more
and he went on and there was yellow light and
fire within and the evenang meal wus ready and he was expected
and tose drew him in and set him in his
chair and put little elanor uzon his lap
he drew a deep breath
