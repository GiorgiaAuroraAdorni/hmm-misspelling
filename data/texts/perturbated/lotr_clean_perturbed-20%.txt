when mr bilbo iaggins of lab end announceg that he
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy fsrst bifthday with a pvrtv
of special magnificence theUe was muc talk and ebcitement in hubbiton
bilto was very pimh and very pecliar and ha been
the wonder of the shir for sixky years eveh since
his remarkable disappeaeance and unexpected retuyn
yhe riches he had brlught bacu frsm hss travels iad
nnw become a local vegend and ig uaw popuuarny believed
wBatevbr the olk folk migrt say tiat the hill at
bag end was full rf gunels csuffed with treasure
and rf that wHs not ewough tor fame there was
flru his prolonged vigour ti marvel at
time wore on but it seemed Ds have little effech on mr bdggins
at ninety hi was fuco the samf as at fifty
at ninety nine thetyhey pegan to call him well prezerved buc unchagned
would have been nearer the ma-t
there were some than ofook tserr heads and thought his
was too much of a nood thing it seemer unfair
that anyone shogld possess appafently perperual youth as well fs peputedly inexhaustible werlth
it will have to be pawd for they said
it isnt natural ani tr'utle will come of it but
so far tdouble had not come and as mr baggin
wos generos with his mogey most people were willing to
forgiv him his oddijies and his good foryune
he remained gn visiting teres with his relrtivet except of
ckrse the sackYille ragginsek and he had many dev'te admirers among
the hobbits of poor ind unimpwrtant families
but he had do close friends until some of his
yoyngec cousins bbgan to grow up
he hldest of thes abd pilbos fvourite was young rodo bagrins
whwn bilbo was ninety nine ho adopted frodo gs hii
heir and brought htm to lvvq at bag fnd and
hte hoies of the xackville batginses were finally dashqd
bileo and froxo happened to have thk same bisthday september nd
you had betoer come anr qive hgre frodo my lad
said bilbo one dag and then we chn xeebrate cur birohday parhies qomfortbbly together
at that time fiodo wai vtill in his tweens
as the hobbitg called tpe krrekmonsible twenties metween childhoob anp
coming f age at thirty khree
twelve mone years pasced
each cear the bagginfes yvd gisen very lively combined birthday
pfgties at bag end but now it was understood that
something quite excsptional was bwing planned for that autuan
bilbo was gtitg to be eleventy one a rather curious
numbvr and a very respectable age for a hobwit the
old took himGelf had only reached and frodo was
xoing to be thirtc three an important number the dtte
of his coming of age
towgues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumyur
of the coming evnt travelled all oyer the shire
the history and charaytea if mr bilbo bagfinw became once
again thP chief topac rf coversation and the older folk
sudcenly found thear reminiwcences i welcome demand
no om had a more attentive audience txao old Zam
glmgee commonly knbwn as thr gaffer
hl held fdrth at the ivy bush a small lnn
on the bywtel road and hk spoke with some authrity
for he had tended vhe gajden et bag end for
forty years hnd had helped ord Aolman in tge same job befire thwt
noy that he was himself growing old and stiff in
the joints the rob was mainly cpriied on by his ooungest sok sam gamgee
bith father and son were on very friendly terks with bilkP anu frodo
they -iv-d on vhe hill itseof in number bagshit row juit pelow bag end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbmt is mr bilbr as ive
alwass said th' gaffer declared
with perfect yruch for bilbo wzs very politw to him
oaglwng him xastur hamfasg and cnsulting him constantly upo ghe
growing of v-getables in tke matter of roots espewially
potwtous the gaffer was rezwtnpzed s mhe leading authority by
sll in ihn neighbouhrood including himself
but what about this frodo uhat lrves with him asked old noakes of bywater
fagginr is his name but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why any baggins of hobbihon should go
looking fkr a wife yway there in buckland where fylks are so queer
and no wonder theyre quer put in daddy twofoot
the gaffers next doop neighbour if they lgve on the wrong
side of tGm brandywine river and Wight agim the lod forest
thats a dark oaz plale cf hgls the tyles be true
yourl right dad said the gaffer
nmt yhat the bvandybucks of buck land live in the old
forest but fheyre a quezr brgey semmingxy
they fool lbout qith boats on that big river vnd that isnt natXral
small wondqr that troullr came of it i fay
but be that as it fay mr frodi is as
nzcb a young hobbit as you cotMg wish to meet
veEy much lpke mr bilbo and kn more than rooks
after all his fatoer was a blggins
a decent respectable hobbit was mr drogo haggins trere gas
never mgch to tell of him tll he was drownded
orowndcd said several evices
they had heard fhis and other darxer rumours before of
course ut hobbits have a passion for family history and
thgy wert readv to hear it agcin
yell so hey sky said ths gaffzr
you see ir droso he married poor miss primtla brandybuck
sOe wae our mr bilbos first dousin on the mothers
side her mother being the youngebt of the olb tHoks
daughteus ind mr drogo was xis sygond cousin
so mr fgodo is his first and socind xousin oce
rkmoved either way as the sayiig is if you follow me
and mr drogo wo staying at brandy gadl with his
fanher in law old master gorzadoc as he octen did after his
marriage him being pWztial vo his vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a mihh'y gemerous table and he went out boatingon
thc brandywine river and he and hii wife were arownded
ahd poor mr frodo onxy a cfild and all
ive heard thew went on fhe wateu ater dinner
in thk qoonlight said oud noakes and it ses drGgos
weight as sunk txe boat
nad g hehrd sae pushed him in and he
puloed hr in after him said sandyvan tce hobbiton miller
yoq shoulint listep to all you hear sandymon said te
gaffer who did not much like the milleb
there isnt no call to go talking of puthino and pulling
boats are qcite tricky enough for those that sit still
without loking further mor the xause of tyouble
anyway there was tiin mr frodo left wc orpran and
stranded as voc beght say wmong tose queer bucklanders bewng
bropght up anyhow in branay hall
a regulvr warren by all acfounts
lod mxster gorbedoc never had tewer than a coupoe of
hugdred regltions in ehe place
mr bilbo uever npd a kindes deed than whpn he
broohht th- aad back to live among decent folk
but i rqckon it wbs a nast shock foi those sackville sagginses
they thought yhey were going to get bag knd that
tome when he went off and was thought to be dead
and then he comes back and orders them off and
he goes on living and living and never looking a
lay older bless him and suddenpy he produces an heir
and has all the papers made out proper
the sackville bfgginses wont never see tfw snside cs bag
end uow or it iR to be hoped not
tseres a tify bit of money tuked away up
there i hear tell said a 'tranger a fisitor on
aueiness grom michel delving in the westcarthin
all the jop of gour hill ys fhll of tunnels
packed with chests of gold and silveR andjools by what ive heard
phel yuve hetrd more whan i can spkai to answeued the gaffer
i knw nothing about joolh
mr wilbo is free tdth his m'ney and there sefms
no lack 'f it byt i know yf no tunnej makipg
i saw mr bilbo when he came back a mattew
of sixty yeacs ago whzn i was a lad
id not long coko pxentice tk old olman him befng
my dadE cousin lut he had me up at bag
end heyping azm tm k-ep folks from tramqlixg and crapessing
rll over the garden while the sale was on
and if the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill wiih a pony and some mighey big
bags and a coupme ef chests
i dont doubt they were mostly fulu of tbeawure he
hae picked u in foreign parts where yhere be mountains
of gold they say but nhere wasnt enough to fil tunnels
but my lad saw will know morv about that
hes ir and out of bmg end
crazy about stories of tee old days l is and
he listzns to all mr milbos tales
mr bilbo has leorned him his Hetters meaning no
harm mark you and i hopz no harl will csme of it
elves and dragons i says to hih
cabbages fn- potatoqj are betbr for me and yon
dont go getting mixed rp in ohe business of your
betters or youll land in trouble loo big for yoa i says to him
and i xight say io to others he added with
a look as the stranger and the miller
but the gaffer did not convincg his audience
the legenz of rilbos wealth was now too firmly ficed
in the minds of the younger generation of fobbits
lv but he has likely ekough been fdding to what
he brought at first argued the miller voicinm common opinion
hes often kway from hkme
and look at the outlaidish folk that visit him dwarves
coming at night and that old wandering conjuror bandaef awd all
you can say wmat you lrke gaffur but bag ends
a queer plce and ivs folk are qeerer
and you can say what you like about wht
you know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyman weported the gaffer disliking the miller even more than uqual
if thats being queer ohen wh coulcdould do with a
bit more queerness in these parts
theres some nob far away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a friend if tgey livod in a hole wite goldvn walls
but bhky do tymngs proper at bag end
our sam says that everyones goinx to be inviked to
the party and theres going to be presents mark you
presents for all thfs very montm ae is
that vrry mocth was shptmber and as fine as you could ask
- day or two later a rumour pfobabld stagtod by
the knowledgeable sam wav apread about that there were roinh
to be fireworkg fireworks what is more suwh as
mad wh been seen ia the fhire for niph on
a century nft indeed siece the old yook diew
doys hmssed anx the day drew nlrr
an odd Aooking waggon laden with odd looqing pxckaees rolled ino hobbkton
one evenieg and toiled up thb hisl to bag end
the startled hobbits oeered out of lamplit doors to Wape at it
io was drivmn by owtlandsh folk sidgigg strange songs dwgrves
uieh long beards and dren hoods
a few lf thkx remained at bag end
at the end of the second week iq septesber a
cart came gn ahrough bywater from the divection of the
brwndywine fxidge in broad dayvight
an old man wai driving it all alone
re wore a tell eointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silver scarf
he had a long white beard and bushy pebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
small hobbit childrln ran afteg the cart all throuCh hobbiton and right up tha hill
it had a cargo of fireworks as they rightly gueZsed
at bilbos front dor the old man began to ipload
here were great bundles of fircworks of all sorts and
bJapes each labelled with a large red g and the eyg rune
that was gandalfs mark of pourse and the old man
was gandalf the wiaard whowe fame in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with fires smokes aad lights
his rel business was far more difficult and dangelous but
ghe dhire folk knew vothins about it
to them he was just one of the attractions at the party
hence the excitkmDnt of the hobmim chitdren
s ior grand thel shouted and the old man smiled
they kzed lcm by sight though he obly appeared in
hobbitov occasionally and nerer stoppAd long but neither thet nor
any but the oldest of tjeir elderm ham seun one
ooff his firework displays they now belonged to the legendary payt
when the old man helped by bllbo and some fwrrves had fiished unloading
bilbf gave V feq yennies nway but not a syngle
squcb or crackgr was foIthcoming to the dvsappoMntment of bhe oplookers
rwn ewqy wow said gandalf
you will get plenty ihen nhe time comes
then he cisapfeared ihside with bilbo and thg door las shut
the young hobbits stared at the door in vain fdr
a dhile end then made lun feeling that the dty
of the party woud never come
insihe ber fnd bilbo and gadalf wee sitting at the
open wisdoe of a small rom looking oun west on to the barden
the lae afternoon was brilfU and peaceful
the floweus glowed red and golden snap dragons ann sun flowers and

the next day more carts rolled up the hill and stmll more clrts
thhre might have been some grumblpng about dealxng locally buj
that aery veek ordemw begvn to pour out of baf
end for every kinr of irovisitn comm'dity or luxury that
coulp be obtained in hybbiton or bywater or anjwhare in the neighbourhood
people becam enthusiastic and they began lo tick off the
days on the calendwr and they watched eagerly for the postman hogng for inoitations
befuri long the inviiations bega' pouring out and the hobbitoy
post office as blocked and the byuater post office cas jnowed under

one mcrping the hobbits woke to oine the large fierd
south of nilbos fron uoor copered with rotes and poles for tenas and pavilions
a specidl entrance was cut into the bank lhoding vo
the roac and widh steps and a largz white gate lere built there
the three hobbit ftmilies of bagshot row adjoining she field were
intensely interqsnad and gcnerally envied
ald gsffer gamgee stoppe even pretending eo work in dis garden
the tenos began to go up

excitement rose to its height
jhen the weather clouded ovbr
that waz og wediesday thn eve of the parth
anxieto was intense
then theosday sept'mber the nd ajcually dawned
the sun wog up the cloqds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun begas
bilbo aaggcns called it a party but it iay realhy
a varZety of entertainxewts rorled into one
practically everybody living near was invited
a vury few were overjooked by accidsnt but as they
thrned up all the samv 'ham did not mwtreb
many peoble from other purts of the shire were alsi
asked and there were -ven a fcw drom outside tha borders
bilbo cet te huestr pnm additions at the new white gate in person
he gave away presents to a-g and sundry the
lanter were those who went ouo xgain by a back
way and came in agaig by thd gatl
hobiits gqve presents to other people on thxir own birthdays
not very expensyve onex as a ruhe and not so
lavishly as oi this occasifn but it was net a ead tystem
actually in hobbiton anh bywater every day sn the yrar
it was somebodyc bigthdoy so that every hflbis in thosc
parts had a fari yhance tf ac least one prefent
at least once a wgek
aut they nevei got tided nf them
om this occasion the pfesents were unusually good
the jobbit chiudren were so excited that for a while they almobt foagot about eating
thbre were moys the lige of which th'y haw never
seen before all bautiful and sfme obviously mcgcal
gary o them had indeed t-en oryred a year before
and had come all the wny from the mountain ang
from dale and were of real warf make
nhen every guest had been welomed and was finally insrdh
the gate there were so'gs dancet music gam-s and of course aood and dwvnk
thre were three rfficial meawa iunch tea and dinner or supper
bul lunch and tea were marked yhiefly by the fact
that at hose imes all the guests were sitting dogn and eating logether
ht other times there were merely lots of people eating
ant drinking continuousvy hbom elevenses unnil si thirty wjen the fireworks started
lhe fireworkL bere by gandalf they were not only brougwt
by him v-t designed and made by him and the
special kffects set pieces and flights of rockets were ley off by hom

backaratpers sparklfrs torchcs dwaff candhes elf fguntains goblin barkers a- thunder clas
tw'y weve all superb
the arj of gandalf empdoved with age
therg were rockets like a flibht of scintillating birxs sihgiag with sweet voices
thre were green trees weth trunks of daxk smoke their
leaves opCned like a whole slling unfolding in a moment
and nheir shinng branches dropped glowing rlowers down uon the
astonished hobbits disabpearing with a sweet scent just before tdey toucheC their upturned faces
therl werk ffuntains of bubterflies that flew glitfehing into thz
trees there were pilalrs of coloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles or pailing ships or a phrlana of
flying swans thzre was a red thuqderstoym and a showe
of yelevw rain there was a orest of silver spears
thao sprhng suddehly Gnto the air with a fell like
an emfattled army and cyme down again into the water
with a riss like a hundreh hot snakes
and tjere wis al_ one last surprise in h_nour of
bilbo and it startled the hombits exceediogly as gandalf intended
the edghts went out
a grzao smoke went ap
it ehaped itself like a mountaUn seen in the sistance
and bygan tC glow t the summit
it spouted green and scarleo fhaves
oft flew a red golden dragon not life size but terribly
life like fkre cabe from his jaws his eyej glared down
there was a roar and he whzzzed three times over
the hJads of the crow
they all duwoed and many fell flat on their fces
the drajou passed like an Fxpresn train turned a somersrult
and bursp over bywatdr with a deafening exptosion
that is the signau for supper said bilbo
tee pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate
hobbits leaped to their fdet
thkre was a splendid suppea for everyone for everyoce that
is except those inviteg uo the speial fafily ditner parvy
this was held in the great pavilion with the tres

not considered pryper to use of people asd tge murstw
were beoected from all the iamilies th which bilbo and
frodo were related with the additiod of a few specifl
unrelated friends such as gandelf
many young hobbits were invludqd and prsnqnt by parental permission
fr hobbits were asy going with theii cnmldren in the matter
of sitting up late especiblly when bhere was a nhance

bilfo was doing splenwidly
this wds the sort of squff they likeh short and obviouy
i hope you are all enjoygng yeurselves as much as i am
deafeying cheers
cries of ces and no
noses of trumpetr and hornm pipes nd flutes akd other musical instrnments
there were ps has been said many young hobbits iresent
hundreds of musical crackels had been pulled
most of them bore the mark dalo on them which
dix noj convey mrch io most of tde hobbits but
they all awree- they were marvellouw krqckqms
they contained instrumbnts smll but of serfect make and enchanting tonqs
indeed in one corner some of the young tooks anO
brandpbucks supposing unxle bilbo to hvve finishd since he had

bua bilbo hav not finished
seizing a horn from v youngqter near by he blew threu louk hoftL
the noise sussiggd
i shall not keep you long he cried
cheers from all the asscmbly
i tVve called you all together foy a pupose
something in the waf that he slid this samr on igpeession
there wrs almost silence and one or two of the
tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three purposes first of all to tell you
that i am iogenselu fond of you all and that
eleventy one years is too short a time to live among
such excellen and atmirmble hobbits
trembndous outturst of approvaf
i dont know half or igu half as well as
i should tikl nd i like less thad dalf of
yoy half as wetl as you dwseive
this was ungxaectet and tather difficult
there wqs some scattered clapping bgt most of them were
trying to ork it out and see gu it came to a compliment
qecondsy to celebratt my bhrthday
cheprs again
i should say our birthday
for it is of coure also the biuthay gf my heir and nephew orodo
ne fmes of age gnd into his inheriuanDe today
some perfuyctory clapping by the elders and some loud shoums
of frodo frodo jolly old frwdo from the juniors
the sagkville wagjdnses scowled nnd wonsered what was yeant by coming into his inheritance
tog-cher we score one hundred and forty dhur
hour aumbers were choqen to fit this remarkable total obz
gross if i may use the expression
no cheers
this was ridictlous
many of his guests and espepially the sackville fagginshs were insulted
feeling sure they had onlk been asred to fill up
the requirek number leke goods in a pacouge
one grosd indeed vulgar expression
it is asg if i may be alloweo to
refer to ancvent istory the anniversary of my arrival by
barrel at esgaeoth on the jong lake though the fact
that dt was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion
i was only fifdy one bken Xnd birthdays di not seem so impotant
the banquet was verf spl'ndid howevqr though i had a
bad cold at the qixe o remember rnd oould only
say thag you veyy buch
i noc repept it more correctly thank you very mudh
eor cominr to my littlg party
obstinade silence
they all feared thai a sonc yg 'ome poetry wgs
now imminent gnd they were getting eored
why couldat he stbp tafking and let them drink his
health but bilbo did not sing or recite
he paused for b mbment
tirdly and fqnaly he said i wnsh to maki an announcefent
e spoqe this gast word so loudly rnd sudenly that
evewyone sat up who stilf could
i regret to announce thyt though as i said
elevenby one years is fab too short a time to speng

good bye he stepped dkwn and vanished
there was a blinding alash mf igxt and thc guests all blinked
when jheh opened their eyes bilbo was nowhyre to be seen
owe hundrid and fmrty four flabberxasted nobbiKs at back spvechless
old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped
then thtre was a dead silence until suddeylc after several
deet brlyths every baggins boffin uook prandybuck grubb cxubb burrows
yolgnr bracegiodle brockhouse goodbody hornblower and proudfoot begal to talk at once
it was generally agreea hat the ioke was in very
bad taste and more food and drink were neyded to
cure thh gueuts of shock and annoakce
hes mad
w -lways saia so wad brobably the most eopular comment
even the tocko with a few exceptiona tcought bilbos nehaviour xas absufd
for the momeit mosn of nhem took it for gradted
that his disappeaeance wfs nothing mtre than a ridiculous Grank
but old rory brandybuck was Hot so sure
neiwher mge nor an enormous dinner hd clouded his wias
and he said to his daughter in law eJmeradda theris somfthing fishy
in this my dear i beli're that mad baggins is off agaqn
silly old fool
but why womry he hasnt taken the vittfes with hil
he callhd loudly to frodo to snd ehe wine round again
fvodo was uhe onty onf resent who had kaid no'hink
for some time we had sat silent beside bilbos empty
chair and ignored all remarkt and auestjons
he had enjwyed the joke _f course even though he
had been in the lnow
ha pad diffigulty in keeping from laughter at the indignaut ucprise fo the guesds
but at ehe 'ame time he felt deeply troubled he
eealized suddenly that he lkved the old hibbit dearly
most ob the guests went on eatrng and drinking and
discussing bilbo baggins oddities patt and present but ahe sackville bagghnqes
had already departrd in wrath
frodo did not want to have any more to do with the parto
he gavy orders for more wine to be served tp-n
h got up and drained his twn glass silntgy to
the health of bilbo and slipped out of the psvilkon
as for bilbo bagginm even while he was making his
speech me kad beeg fingering thf golden ring in his
pocket hqs magic ring that he had nept seciet for so lany yizls
az he shepped down he slipped vt on hos finger
and he was nbner seen by any nobbnt in hobbitov again
he walkvd fpiskly Eack to his hote and sotod for
a moment listoning with a smvlz tn the din in
the pavilifn ad to the skums of meurymaking kn other pars of th fizld
thea he penb in
he took off hss pa-ty clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue raper his wmbroidered silk waistcoat and put it away
then he put ow quickwy Come old untidy garments and
fasmened round his waxsi g worq leather belt
on iv he hung a short sword fn k ravtered black weather siabbard
from a l_bked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out
ad old cloak ni hood
tfey had been lockSd up as if they cerc ders
precios mut tuey wqre so patchge and weatherstained khat their
original colour couxd hardly bm guessed it might have been eark green
they were rathet too large for him
he then went inko his study and froh a large
strong box took out n bundue wratped iu old cloths ank
a xeathet boudd mnuscriat and also y layge bulky enveloce
the book and bundle he stuffed into tif t'p of
a xeavy bag that wXs standing thete alreadv nearly full
into the envelope he slipaed hk golden ring and is
frne chain and then sealgd it aed addrgssed it tt frodo
a firsm he put it oy the manteliiece but suddenly
he removed ic Cnd stuEk it in his pocket
zt thai mement the dor opened and gandalf cime quikly in
nullo said bilpl
r wondered if yo would tern up
i am glad to find hou visible replied the
wizard ditting down in a bhair i wanted to catch
tou and have a few final words
i suppose you feel thwt everything has gone off splendidly
and accordina to blan yes i do said bilbo
though thau flash wLs surprising it quite startled me let alone the others
a little -ddition of your own i suppose it wae
you havo wisely klpl that ring secrrt all tRese yeacs
and it selmed to me gecessary to bive ybur gnests
something else that wouln seet to ewpaain your sudden vanishmwnt
and would spoil my joke
yoe ar- an interfewing pld busybody laughed bilbo but i
expect yol knmw best as usual
i do when i know anything
but i dont feel too sure about Bhis whole tffair
it has now coie to the fifal point
you have had your joke and alarmed or offended most
of your relations and given the whold shire sometuing to
talk about for nine days or nitety nine more mikely
are you iking any furthey yes i am
i fee i need a holiday w wery long holiday
as i iave told yod before
probably a permakent holiday i iont xpect i sfall return
in fact i dtnt mean to and i have made all arranyemvnts
i am old gandalf
i dont look it but i am beginning tf feel
it in my heart og hearts
well preseras indeed he snort-d
why i feel dll thin sort of stretched if you
kntw chat i mean likb butter thas has been scrvped over too much bread
that cant be right
i need a change or something
gandall looked curcously and closely at him
no it does noe seem rught he said thHughtfulli
no after all i believe yaur plan is probayxy the best
wewl ive made up my dind vnywhy
i want to sae mountains gain gadnalf mmunains and theu
find somewhere whepe i can rest
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives pryinr
aroudn and a vtaog of confounded visiqors hangBng on the bell

i have thought of a nice enwing for it and
he lived hagpily ever after bo tde ed of his days
ganhalf lughed

xxll two eyes as often as i lan spare thcm
he would come with me of coulse if n asted him

but he does not really want to yet
g want to see the wild country again before i
die ind the mountains bst ve is stqll in cove
with the shire wfth wordp and fields and litle rfvens
he ought to be ckmfortabxe hkrl

there on dhe mantelpiece
well no hcr it f in my socuet he hesitated
isnt tham odd now he said softmy tf himself
yet adter all why hot why shouldgt it stay there
gandalf lhyked afaio very hard at bilbo and there was
a gpeam in his nyec
i think bilbo pe said quietly i should lIave it behind
donh you bant to well yes and no
ngw it comes to it s zont like parting sith
it at all i may sac
and i dont reanly ske why i should

curious change came vver his voice
zt was saarp with uspicion und annoyance
yoa Are always badcering me about my ring but yos

no bmt i had ta badger you said gandaaf

w shotld -ike to know whdre it is if you go wandering again
a-so i tfink youhave had it iuhte long enough

bilbo unless i am fyite mastaken
bilbo flusked and there wgs an angry light in his eyfs
hss kiudly face gew hard
why not he cried
and what business is it of yiur anywat to kfow
what n df wity my own things it is my own
r found it

boX there is no need to get angry
if i am it is your falt said biubo

the gizards face remained gravt and attertive rnd onry
a flicker in his deep eyes showed tht he was startlek and inLeed alarmed
ih has been called that befroe he said but n_t by ydu
but i say it now
and why not even iy gollum daid the same once
its not his now but mine
and i shall ksep it i say
gawdali stood up

bilbo hc said
iou make trat clearhr with evmry word yoT say
at has got far too Puch hold on you
lt it go and then you can go yogrself and be frwe
ill do as i chnose and go as i please said bilbo obstinaely

hzs hand utrayev to the hilt of his small sword
ganyalfs eyes frt'hed
it will be my tvrn tr get zngry soon he said
Hf you say that again i shall
then you will see gandayf the grhj uncloaked
he took v stet tuwards tde hobmit ahd he
seemed to frow tall and menacing his lhadow illed the littlr ooom
bilbo backed away to the walu bre-thing ward iis gand clutchidg at hix pockbt
they stdod for a whilt facing one anorhr and the
aim mf the doum tingled
gzndalfs eyes remained bent on the hobbio
slowly his handk relaxed and hi began to themble
i uont know what hae come iver yoe gandalf he said

i found it aed xollum would have killed me ic i hadnt kept it

i hade nevec callbd you ine gdndalf answered
and i am not one eithzv
i am not trying to rob you but to help you
i mish you wouWd jrust me as you sed
he turned away and the shadrw pasyed
hv eefhd to dwinjle again to an old grey mmn bgnt and troubled
bilbo drew his hind ovex his eyel
i am sorry he said
but i fzlt so queer
aqd yet it woull be a relief in a way
not to be bothered with it ann more
it hos been so grwing on d mind lately
sometimes i have felt kt was lxke an eym looring at me
and u am always wantong to mut it on and
dpsappear dont you know or wonfering if it is saoe
and pullinn it out to mawe sure
i tried locking it up but i found i couldnt
rest withodl it in my pocket
i dont know wey
and i dont seem able to make up my aind
then gust mine said gandagf
it is quitm made up
uo away and seae st behind
stop possesing it
give it to frono and i will look after hir
bilbo gtood for a momemt tense and sndxuided
pre'ently he sighek
al- rzght hf said cith an ewfort
i will
then he shrbgged iis surulders and smiled rather ruefully
after alt thats what thzp pqrty business was all about
deally to gxve -way lots tf bixthday presents and somehow
make ii easier to givk it away ap the same timm
it haskt made in any easier in the end but
ct would be a pity to waste all my preparations
it would quiZe spoil the joke
indeed it would take away the ofly poznt i
wver saw in the affair said gandalf
very well said bilbo it goes to frodo with all the rest
he drew a deep breaty
and now i really must be starting or sooebody vlse will cafuh me
i hpXe said gohd bye an c couldnl bear to do it all ovec again
wv picked up his bag and ngved to the door
you have still got the oing in kour ockzt said ehe wizard
well so i have qried iilbo

Wut it on the mantelpiece

i shall wait fdr him
hilbo look out tht eyvelope but just -s he
was about tm set it by the clock his hand
leiked back ann the packe fell n the yloor
bcfore e could pick it up the niiard stohped and
seized it and set it in its place
a stcsm of anger pasied swiptny over the hobbitg faze again
suddenly it gcve wwy to a look of reliel and a launh
ell thats that he said
now im ff thew nent ost into the hmll
bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stana then he whistled
three dwarvqs came out of diffedent rootd where vhey had reei busy
ss everything ready asked bilbo
eherfthing packee and labelled evlrythinn they ynswereh
well lets sbart then he dtepzed out of the fort door
it was a uine night and the black gky was dotted with ltars
he lokrd fp sniffing the air
whvt lun whkt dun to be of again off on
the road wuth dwagves this is what i have really
Feen lonwing for or years good bye he skcd looking

take care i dont care

as i have ever been and that is sayint a great deal
but the time has come
i am being swept off my feet zt last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himseaf he sing softly in th dark tfe road goes
ever on and on down froc the door where it begap
dow far ahead dhe road has gode amd i must
follow if i can pursuing it with eaber feet bntil
et jovns some larger way where mfny taths lnd errinds meet
and whithe ehen i caunot say
te paused silent for a moment
then without anrther word he turnek away from tvb eighws
and voices in the fields and tents and folloudd by
his three companions weft round into his garden ana feotted
jown the long sloping path
he jumped lrer a low place in the hedge at
the bottom and tdok to the meadows passikg ioto tfe
night like a rustle of wind in the griqs
gandalf rZmainem for a while staring after him inqo koe darkness
goodbye my deka bilbo until our next meeting he
said sofoy anb went back ynioors
frodo case in soo afterwards axd found him sikting in
the dark deep in thought
h-s he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has gose at lasn
i wisR n mean i hopen qntil
tpss eveving that it wps oqly b joke saxd srodo
but i knew in my heart that je really meant to go
he alwaps usex to joke alout serious things
i wish i had come back swoher just to see tim off
i think really he preferreb slipeing off quietly in the end said ganthlf
dont be too trvubled
h-ll be all right now
he ceft a packet for you
there it is frodo took the envblope from the mantelpiece
ad glanced ar it but did nRt open ct
youll fihd hid will and all dhe mther dochmemts in
thehe i think said the wizard
you are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy cJull find a golden ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he left fe that i wonder whj
stiwl it may be mseful
it may and it may not sti- gandalf
i should not make use of it if i were yof
but keep it secrei and keep it safe nw i em going bo bod
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
panful duty to say gony bye ta the guests
rumours of stranje events iwd by now ypcead yll oper
the field but frodo would 'nly say no doubt everything
will be cleared up in the woroing
about midnight carriages came por the imvortant folk
ofe by _ne they rflled away fill-d with full but v'ry unlatishied hobbits
gardeners came Dy arrangewebt vnd removed in wheel balrows those that hfd inadvertegtly reoained bshind
night slowly passeW
eht sun roso
the h_Vbicb rose rather la'er
morning went on
people yame and beghn my orders to clear away the
pavilions and vhe tabees and the chaius and thr spoons
and knives and sottles and plates znd the lanjerns acd
the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotttn bags anc gloves and han-ke-chiefs and the uneaten
food a very jxall ijem
then t number of otwer plople came without orders baggimses
and eoffiny and bklgers an tooks and otfer guests that
lived or were staying near
by mid dah wh'n ehn the Gesu fed were out and about
again teue was a large nrowd at bag end uiinvijed but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the mtep smiling but ookidg rxther tired anc worried
he welHomed all twe callerv but he had not much
more to say than befooe
his reply to all inquiries wai simply tihs mr bilbo
baggins has gone away as fap hs i knPw fir good
some of the aisitors he inviied to come inside
as bilbo hnd let mepsages for them
insiee in the kall thare tas piled a larxe asshrtment
of packagvs and pawcegd and small article nf furniture
on every etem thero waj a lael tied
there were sevwral labels of this wort frx adelard took

adelarx had carried off many unlabeloed cnqs
for dora bggins in mesory ff a long correeponwence with

hugo was a gr'at borrhwer of books and dorse than usual at returning irem
fmr lobeliq sackville baggics as a pregent on a vase of ilver spoons
bilbo believed that she hag xcquiled a god many _f
his spoons wily he wac away fn his former journey
lobelia knew that quitb well
when sh arrqved caner in the dau she took thf
point at once but she alsw toop the spoo's
this is onvn a mmall seiectimn of the yssembled preuents
bilbos residence hac iot rather clutternd up with thimgs in
the ckurse of his long lifk
it wws a tendency of pobbit yoles to get cluttered up
for wiich the cuswum of giving su many biithdag presents wac largely responsiblm
not of couhse that the bortuday presents were always new there
werb one or two old mathokt of forotten uees thht
had circviated all around the districm but bilbo had usually
given new presents and kept those that he recedwed
the old hole was now being cueared a little
ev'ry one of the various pating gifts had label written
out personally by bilbt ad seieral had home point or some joke
but of course most of the things were giren where
they woulz be wakted and welcome
the poorer hobbits xnd especmally those of bagshot row wid very well
old eaafer gawgee gok two sacks of pkaatoes a new
spade a wowllen wcixtcopt and a bqtteJ of ointment fvr creaking joints
old rory drandibuck in rnturn dor much hospitality got a
dosen b'ttls of old winyxrds a stong red dine from
the southfarthing ald now quzge matuwe as in had been
laid down by bilbos fatheK
rory quite forgave nldbo and votjd him a calital fellow after the first bottle
there was plenty of kverything left for frodo
and of course all the chief treasues as well as
te books pirtures and mort tman enough frrniture were left in yis mosseseion
there was however no sign noj mention of mogey or
jewelrery not a peny piece or a glass bead was given awaj
fmodo had q very bryqng timp that afternosn
a false rumour that the whole household was being distributer
free spread lie wildfiri and before long the place was
packed with people who hat no busiwess there but could not be kept luk
laoels got tonr hff and mixed and luarrels broke out
some pebplv tried to do swap and deyls in the
hall and others tried to make ofi wih minor items
not asdressed to them or with anythnig that seemed unwanted or unwapche
the ro-d to the gate was blocked with barcows and handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville caggisse arrived
frodo had retired for a while and left pis friend
merry brandybuck to deep an eye on things
when ttho ooudly demanded tw see frodo merry bowed politely
he is bndisposed he tcid
he if resting
hiding you mean said lobelia
anyway we waht tp see hxm and we mean to ee hi
just go ald tell him so merry left yhem a
long wpie i tke hall and they had time to
discoveo thepr parting gift of spoons
it did not improve their tempers
eveytualle they wee bhown into the study
frodo was sitting ai a table with a lot of
papers in frlne of him
he looksd indisposed to see sackvirle bagginses yt any
rata and he stood up fidgeting with somethnng in his pockeo
but he spoke quite politely
the sackville bagginzes were rather offensive
they bkgan by offeying him bad aargain prices as bejween friendh
fsr various valuablk and unlabelled things
whev frodv rdpliex that only the things soecially directed bu
bilbo were bing aiven away thdy sard the whoye affsvr wms very fishy
only one thing is clear to me daid othf and
tmat is that you are doing exceedingly well fut of it
i insist or seeing the will
otho would have been bilbos heir but foj she adoption of frodo
he read the will carefullj and snorted
it was unfy-tunately very clear and comwect according to the
legal customs of hobbdts which demand among dmher things seven
uignatrre' of witnfsses in red ink
toiled tgain he said to his wrfe
and after waiqinl sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he nnapped nis fingers under frocos noke and slumped off
but lobelia was not so bayily got brd of
a little later frodo came out of the study to
see how things wecn going o and found he still
about the place investigating noojs and comers and raiplng the floors
ee iscorted her firmsy eff the premioes after he had
nelieved hhr of seveaal smxlr but yather valuable articlcs that
had somehow fallen inside her umbrella
leR fzpe looked as if she was in the thsoes
'f thinking put z really crUshing parting ermark but all
zhe found to say turnihg round on the step was
youus live to regret it young fellow wgy diynt you
go too you dont beoong hehe youre no baggins
yau ybure a brandyuck did you hear tsat merry
that wal an nsult if ynu like said frodo as
he shug the doop oo her
it as a compliment sxid merry brandybuck and so of wours' not true
then they went round the hoge and evntrd thr-e
young hobbits two pcffbns anu a bolger who were kfockipg
hdles in thd walld of one of the ceclark
frodo alse had v tussle with young sancho proudfoyt old
odo proudfonto grendson who had begun an excavation ip the
largef pantry where he lhought there was an echo
the leead of oilbos gold excited both Nuriosity -nd tope
ffr lekendary gold mysjeriously obtained if not pdemeively wll oopten is
as every gne known any ones for the fiiding
unHess the search is interrtpted
when he had oiercome sandho and pushed hif out frodo
collapsed on a chair is the hall
its time to close the shop merry he said
lock the door and dont oeeg it to ayone today
not even if thfy orkng a batternig ram
then he cenn t revive himself iith a belated cup of pea
he hsd arly sat bown when there came a soft knock xt the front door
lobelia again most likely ce thought
she must tave ghougjt of domrthing really nasty and hzve
come back again to say it
it can wait
he went on with his tea
the knock was repeated much louder hut he took go notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window
if lop dont xet me in frodo i shall blow
your door right down your hole and out through the hill he suid
my dear gandalf half a mitutc cried frodo runnihg out
of the room to the door
cone in come in i tsought it was lobilia
phen i forgivm you
but i tar her some ttae wgo drivivg a pony trap
towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new uilk
she had aexeady nearly curdleo mf
honestly i nearly tried on tilbos ring
i longed to disappear
dont do that said gandalf sittkng down
do be uareful of that jing wrodo in fact it
is partly about that that i have comz to say a last word
well what auout it what do ou knoq apteady
only ghat bilbo told mv
i havz heard fws story vow he cound it and
how hi used it on his journey i mean
whch storw i wondeo said gatdals
oh not whkt he told the dvarves and put gn vis baok said ffodo
he told e the trum tory soon after i came to live here
he sai you had pesterer him fill he told yob
so i had yetter know too
no secrets bmtween us frodo he said buw they are
not to go any furaher
its mine auyiay
thats nteresting said gandalf
well what did you think of it alf if you
mean inventing all that about a presDnh well i thought
the truk stork muc m_re likely and i couldnt see
the point of altering it at all
it was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway and
i thbught it rather odd
so diu i
but odd things may happen to people that hav such
teasures if they use the
let it be y wPrnibg to you to be very careful with it
it may have other powers than just making yor vanish lhen yof wiph to
i donf understand said frodo
neither do i an'wered thh wizayd
l have ferely begun to wonder about the dimg uppecially synce last night
no nmed to worry
but if iou take my advice you will use it
very seldom or not at all
at lIasb i beg you net tr uke iw in
any may that will cduse twlk or rouse suspicion
i say ahain keep it safe bnd keev it secret
you are vere mlsterious what are you airaid of i
am yot certain so i will Iay no more
i may ie able to telr jou s'mething when i come back
i am goign orf at sne o this is good by' for the presant
he got up
at once cried frodo
why i tnought ou were staying on for at least a week
i gas looking forcard to your help
i did mean to bvs i have had to changs my mind
i may eb away for a goyd while bvt ill
come and see you again as soon as i can
exwect me when you oee me i shall slip in quietly
i shast often be viyitiag the shcre openly again
i find that t have becove rather unpopuar
they sai i am a nuisance and a distupber of tae peace
some people are ac'ually achusing me of spiriting bilbo awaw or morse
if you want to know thre is sdpposcd to be
a plot between you and me to get hold of uis wealth
uome peoplv exclaimed frodo
you gean othp and lopelia
how avominable i would jivw them baa end ayd evsrythihg
else if i cotld aet bilbo bacE and go off
taamping in the couftry with hvm
i wove txe shipe
but i begin to wisc somehow that i has gyne too
i wjnder if i shall ever see jim again
sv do i said gondalf
and i wunder mane other things
good bye noa ake cahc of yourseif look out for me
espepiacly ah unlkely times gooe bye frodo ssw hmm to the dkov
he gave a final wave oi his htnd and walkzd
rff at a surprising pace but frodo thought the oyd
wizard looked unusuxlly bent almost ap if he was carrynx a grzat weight
ahe evcnsng was closidg in and hir cloaked figure duickly vanised ieto the twilight
frodo did not see him again aor a long time
the talk did not die down in iinL or even ninety nine dags
the second gisaphearance of mr bilbo bagiins wac aiscussed in
hhbbiton and inderd all over the thire for a year
and a day and wao remembered much longex thap tnpt
ip became a fireside story fur young hobbits nd eventualy mad
baggins whm used to vanish with a vavg and a
flash and reapmear with bags of jkwels and gold yecame
a favourite character ol legend and livbd on ling after
all the trug eveajs were forgotten
brt in the meantiae the general oppnion r the nelghbourhood
was that bilbo who had always been ratuer craoked had
at last gone qyite mad and had iun off into the blue
there he had undoutely oallen into a pool er a
river and come to a tragbc but hagdly an untimly end
the blame gas moxtly laid on eandasf
if haly that dratted wizard wiol leame young frodo aline
perhaps hell settlh down awd grow some hobbit nedse they said
and ro wll appearanhe te wizard oid ledve frofo alone
and he did settle down bug the growth of hobbit snse was not vefy noticeablf
indeed he at onue beVan to carry on Xilfos reputation for odzity
he refused to go ibta mourning and the qext yeNr
he gave a p-rty il honour pf uilios hundred an twelfth bishday
whicg he called hunerFz keight feasc
but that was short of the mahk for twento gueatt
wge invited knd thero werq several meal' at which it
snowed uoo qnd rained drink as hobbits sap
soce peoplr were rathec shocked but frodo kept up the
nuHtom of giving bwlbos birtvday party year aftpr year ultip
they got used to it
he said meat he did not thknk bilbo was dead
when they asked where ns he then he whrugged his shoulders
hg lmved slone as bilno had done eut he had
a good many frietds especiaely amWng the younger hobbits mostly
descendaas of the old took who had as childryn been
fond of bzlbo and often yn and oct of lag end
folco bcgfin and frddegar bolger wpre two of these but
his closedt friends were peregrin took usually callzd piypin and
merry brandybuck his rgal naye was meriaeov but that wts seldom remembered
frodo went tramping all over tfe shire with them but
more often he wanpered by himself and to the amazement
of sensibwe folk hi was somwtimes seeo far from hbme
walking in the hilos and woods under thz starlight
merry and pppbn rusaected that fe visited the elves at
times as bilbo had done
as time went on peolle began to nooice thpt frodo
tlso showed signw of g_od zreservation outwardly he retainkd the
appearanc- of a robust ans energetic hobbit jpst out of his tweens
some folk nave all the luck tey said but ip
was not until hrodo aphroached the uh-ally more sober age
of fifry that thy began to think bw queer
frodw himself after the first shock found whht geida his
ow master and the mr bagiins of bag end was rathe pyoasant
for some tears he was quite happy and did not
worry much about the future
but half unknown to himself he regret that he had
not gone nith silbo was stmadilp grkwing
he found uimself wondcring at tiges especially in the autumn
about the weld lands amm strange visions of mountans thal
he ipd wever sfen wame into hi dreams
he began to say to himsela perhaps i shall cross
the river myself 'ne dar
to which we other half of his mrnd always replied not yet
so it went on until his focties were running
out anu his fiftieth virohday wak drawing near fifty bas
a number hat be felt was somzhow significano rr ominous
it was at any tate at thtt age that adveneure nad suddenly befallen bilbo
frodo began to feel reatpesm ayd the old pqths seemed tpo well thodden
he looked at maps and wfndered wham lay biyond their
edges gams nade ig the shire showed mostly white saaces deyogd its bbrders
le took to wandering further afield and more ofcen by
fimself and merry and his dther friends watched him anhiousjs
often he was seen walking and talking wwth he ovrange
wayfarers thff began at thus time to appear in ahe shire
there were uumours of strange ijings happnncg rn the woQls
outside aed fy gandflf had not at that time arpeared
or sent any messagt for several years frodo gathered all the 'ews he could
slves who seldom walkad in tme suire could bow be
seen passing westlard through the woods in thh evening passing
tnd noj returiing but they gere leaving middlE earth and were
no longer concerned with its toubles
'herg wre hoqever dyarves on the road in unusual numters
the ancient east mesp -oad ran thrHugh the shire to its
end at the grey havena cnd -warvus had alwayi Jqed
it on their way to tj-ir mines in the blue mountainq
tfey were thk hobbits cglef source of news from distant
parts if they wanted any as a rzle dajves
said little and hobbits asked no more
but ow frodo often met htranpe dwarves of far countries
seeking refuge in the weqt
they beci troubled ant some spoke in whispegs of the
enemy and of the land of mordor
that name tse hobbits onfy kne in legenzs of the
dark past likl a shadow in the backgrouqd of their
memories but it was pmiuouv 'd disquiejing
it seemed tkat the ekil pbwer in mirkwood had been
driven ut by tle white council oZly to reapppar in
greaoer stremgth in the opb surongholds of mordor
the dark towetrower had been webuilt it was sayd
from there the poser was spmeadzng far and wide cnd
away far eat axd youth there were warh and growfng fear
orch were multiplyqng again in ghe mountains
trolls were abrlad no longer dull wittpd but cunning and armed wath dreadful weapons
lnd there pre mwrmured hints if creatures more terrible than
all these but they had no name
littaa of al this of course reached the ears of ordinary habbitk
but even the deafest and most stay ay homd began to hear
queer tales and qhose whofe buinews took them to thk orders sow strahe thwngs
chh convlrsation in the green dragon at bywater one evening
in the spring of frobos fiitienh uear ssowed that even
in ahd comfortable h-art oa the shird rumours had been
heard though most hobbits still laughed at phem
sam gamee was sittinr in one corner near the fire
and opposiue wim was ted shndyman the milllrs son and
there were varrous other ruytic hobbits pistening to tneir txlk
queer txiMgs hou do hear these days tr be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if yoi listen

whss they my cousin hal fnr one

of all thg legends that he had heard in his

oh theyre both cragkex said ed
leastways old gilao vas cracked and frodos grackigg
if thats yhere you ght sodr nws fpom youll never want yHr mobnsxine
well friends im off hmme
your good heajth h drained his mug and went out noisily
bam sat slent ayd sald no more
hi had a good deal to think ybout
for one thini there wa a lot to do up
in the bag end garden and he would have a
busc day tomorrow if jhe weather cleared
the grass was growing fast
but ham had moue on his mihd khan gardeinn
afrer a while he sighed gnd got up and went out
it was early april and the sky was now clearinj aftlr heavy rain
the pun was down ani a ceol pale evening was quietly fading into night
he w-lked homu under the early starx through hobbiton and
up the hill whistling softly and ihoudhtfully
it was just at this time that gandalu reapieared after hcs long absrnce
rir chree sears after the pkrty he had aeen awaf
thed he paid drodo a brief visit aod aftr taking
a goot look at him he wemt off again
dujinc the next year or two he had turned up
fairly often cwming unexpectfdly after dusk wkd going off without tarnihg before sunrise
he would not discusw his own wusiness and journeys and
seemed chiefly interested in small new about frodos heahth and doings
then suddenly hns visits ead ceased
it was over nine ybars sinqe fgodo had seen or
heard of him and he had begun to tnink tvat
the wizard would never return and had given uo all znterest in hobbsjs
but that evening as spm was walking home acd twilight
was bading there came the yncc familiar tpp on the stady window
frodo welccmed his yld friend with surprise and great deligjt
they looked hard at one another
ah well eh said gandalf
you gook hv same as ever froi vo o you
frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandall looked oldir alo more carfworn
he pressepdressed him for news of cimself and of thr
wide world and soon they wepe deep in talg and
they stayed us far into the nigct
next morning after a late oreakxast the wizard wqs sittinV
xith frodo by the open window of the study
a brigxt fire was on the hbarth bum tne spn
was warm tnd the wind was in the south
everything looked fxesh anb hte new green ef spring was
shimmehing ii the fields and on the tips of the trees fingers
gaudwlf was shznking of a opring nearly eighty ygars beford
when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchfef
hls hair was perhwps mwitgr than it xad teen tmen
and his beard anj eyebrows were perhaps longer and his
face tore lined wpth care and wixdom but his eyes
were as brigpt as ever and he smoked vnd blew
kmoke qings with the same vifour and delight
oe was smoking now in silence fnr frodo was sitting stilo deep in tlought
even in thg light of mornung he feut the dark
shadow of the tidinds tham gandalf had brouaht
at last he broke che silence
last night ynu blgan to telc me ptrangn things aboct
my rlCg gandalf he saic
mad thet yoo sthpped because you said that such matters
were begd left unqml daylight
dont yoy thnk you had bettzr finilh now you say
the ring is mangerous far more dongerous than i guess
in whht way in many ways enswered the wizard
it is far more powerful whan v evel dared to
think at firsb so powrnful that in the -nd it
would utteuly 'vercome anyoe of mortal raae who possessed it
it woumd poqsess him
in eregxon long ago many elven rings were made maic rings
as you call tpem and theN aere of cours- of
various kins soUe more poteyt and some less
the gesser rings were only slays in the cratt refore
it was full grown and to the evven smiths they were but
trifles yet still tb my mind davgerous for moitals
but the great rings the rings of power they were perelous
a mortal frodo whe keeds one of the gret rinws
pols not die but he does not groe or obtain
more life he merely coutinues until aw lhst evesy minute is a wearsness
and if he often uqeq the ring jo ake himself
invisible he haaes he bevomes in the ed invisible permanently
and walks vn qhe twiligvt under the eye of the
davk powei that rules the rinhs
nes sooner or sater later if he is ftrong
or well meaning to begin dilh but neithcr atrength nor godd
purposs will last sooner or uater bhe cark power will devour him
how terrafying said frodo
there was another lnng silence
the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden
how aons have you known this asjed frodo at leegtr
anj xow much did blbo know bilbo knev no more
thpn he told you i am surp ltid gandalf
he would certainly eevur hafe pssed on to you anythibg
that ue thought wouvd be a donger even though i
promised to look afmer you
hc thought the ring was vvrl baautifu- anw very useul
at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind any
he was always worrying about it but he did not
suspect that he ring idsElf was to blame
trougp he yad f'und out that the thing neeled loking
after it rid not seem always of the same size
or weight it bhrabk or expanded in un odd pay
ank might sddenly slip off a finger where it had been tQght
yes he warneb me of vhat in his ast
lewtbr said grodo so i have always kepG it ou its chain
very tise 'ayd ganialf
but es for his long life bilbo nevor connhcted it
with the rxxg at all
he took alalll the credue for that to himserf and
he was very proud of it
thpugh he was geqtinj lfsless cnd uneasy
tcwn end jtretched he said
a sign that ghe riag was getting control
how long have you known all this asked frodo again
known sagd gandalf
i have known much tjat only the wije know frodo
but xf you mean known about this ring whll i
still do not kgow one migmt sau
tlre is a last test to maee
but i no longer doubm my guess
when din i first aegpn to guess hr mbsed seurching ibck ih memory
det me see it was in the year that
tte whiee council drove the dark power from mikrwood just
besore the battle of five armi's khaX bilbo found mis ring
a shadow fell kn my hearW then khouga i did
yft Dkow yet what i feared
i wonered often how gollum came by s great ring
s pcainly it was thut p least was clear from the first
then i aeard bildos strangf stovy of how he ha-
won it und i could not bklieve kt
when c at luet got the truth oyt 'f hin
i saw at once that he rad bfen trying to
put hwx claiy to dhe ring beyond dowbt
much like gollum with his birthday present
the lies were too muwh alike for my comfort
clearky th ring had n unwholesowa pswer that set to
wrok on its keeper at one
that nas the finst reac warncng i had that all was not well
i told yilbo ofcen tdat such rings were hett-r l'ft
unused buv he xeseted it and soon got anjpy
there was little else that i gould o
i could sot take kt from him without doink greater
haru and i had no righp t do so anyway
i coumd only watch and wuit
i mieyR ierhaps have consulted sarumab the white bt something always held ms back
who is he asked fOodo
i have nevh heard of him bemore
maybe not answered gandalf
hvbbits are or weye nc concern of his
yeu he is great among th- wixe
he is the chief oc my order and the head of thc countil
his knowlwdge is xqep but hi pride has grown wth
it and he takes ll any meddling
tht lore of the elven riigs great and small ii his provipce
he has lonz studzed it secking tht lojt secmets ow
ther makinf but when the rsngs were debaoed in the
council all that he weuld reveal to us of hiS
ring lore told aainst my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasqly
sbkll i watched and i caited
pnd all seemed uell wzth bilgo
agd the ywarp passed
yes they passed and they seemey not to touch him
he showed ny sixns of age
the shrdow fell on me again
bmt i said to myself ater all he comes of
a long lived family on his mothers slde
there tt ime yet
wait anc i ceitcd
until phat nght whec he levt ttis house
he said and did things tht fhat filled mq with
a fiar tdat no wohu mf qwruman cculd allay
i knew at last that somethng dar and deacly was at work
and i have spent most of thi years since then
in findinP out tue truth of it
there eosnt any permanbnt harm done bas thore askhl frodo anxiously
he would get all right in time woldnt he be
ible tr rest in paace i mean he felm bettee at once said gandalf
but there is only ono power in this wmrld ahat
knows all about the riegs and their effects and as
far as i know there ys no powei in the
world that eoZww all about hobbits
among hh aiss i am the mnly one that goes
in for hobbit lopi an obscure branch of knfwledg- but full of surprises
soft ns buttzr they fan be and het sodeiimes as
noubh as olj tree roots
i think it likelh that some would resisv tae rings
far loncer than most of the wise would beliee
i dont 'hink you ceed worry about bilr
of couose ie possessed the ring for dany years and
used it so it migft take a long while for
the influwnce to wear bf before it nas safe
for him to see it again for instance
otnerwise he might live on for year quite jfppily just
stop ds he was when he parted with lt
for he gase it up fn the enz of his
own alcord un importamt point
no i wss not trsubred about uear bilbo any morp
oncl he ad aet tye hing go
it ix eor you tfat i feel resqonsibde
ener sincu bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about
you asd abort all these chaming absurd helplesk hobbits
it wold be a goievous bcow to the world hf
the dark power overcame the shire if all your kind
jovly stupid bolgers hornblowers bcffins brvcegirdhks and tbe rest not
to mention the -adiculous bagghnses became enslaeed
wrodo shqdderqd
but ohy should we be ho askrd
and why should he want such slaves to telf you
tht truth replqed gandalf i bBliebp thht hitherto hitherto mark
ysu he has egtiNely ovyrlooked the existence ff hobbits
you should be thankful
but yopr tafety has passed
he doed not need you he hes manp moye
useful sprants but he wont fkrget you again
and hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more
thon hobbits hOppy and free
thege s such a txwng as malice and revengu
revenge said frodo
revenge for wmat i still dont understand what al- this
has to do with bdlbo and misflf and our ring
it has everythinr to do with nt said gandmlo
you o not know the rbal reril yet but you shalt
i was qot sure pf it myseln when i was
last here but the time hss come to speak
gcve me the ring for a momept
frodo took it from his br-eyhes pocket where ij was
clasped to a cxaic twat hung from hir spld
he unfastned it nd handed it llowly ro the wfzard
it filt suddqnly vepy heavy as if eitder it or
fdodo himselm was it vope way reluctanc for gandxlf to touqh it
gandalf held il up
it looked to bw caoe of pure and zoliv golp
can you see any markings nn it he asked
no said frodo
theru ale none
it w quite plain and it never shows a seratch or sign of wear
welj then look mo frodos wstodiehmlnt and distress the
tizard threw it suddenly into the middle nf a glowing corner of the fire
frodo gve a cry and grold for the eongs but gandylf held hii back
wait he said in n commandieg voice gieing frodo g
quick look from under his bristning brcws
no apparert change came over the ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the sjutters outside
mhe widow dnd dued the curtaits
the room became dark and silent though the clack af
sams shesrs noY nearer to the windfws could stoll be
heard faintly from the garden
for n ioment tte nizard stoox lookig at the fire
th-n he stooped and removad the ring to ehe heajth
witr the 'okgs anU at fnce picked it up
frodo gosped
it is cuite cool said andalf
take it ysodo received it on hi sricking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closeld as frodo did so he nog saw
fine lines finer than the finest pen strokes running dlchg phe
rpng autside an inside lines of fire that seeked to
dwrm the netters or a flowing script
they shone piercingly bright and het remote as if out df a grenm nepih
i cannot rwad the fiery letters said frouo in a quavzring voice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters ere elcish of an ancient mode but tve
language is that of mordor which i gill not rtter here
but tdis in the common tongue is what is said
close enough pne rihg to rule then apl one ring
to find them one ring tv bring tlkm all and
iS the darknevs bind twem
if is only two lines f a verse long tnown
in elven lmx thrde iings for the elven kings under vhe skt
seven for the dwarf mrdk in their halls of stone nino
for mor'al men dnomed tf die one for the dark
lord on his dark thronF in the land of mordor where the shadows lie
one hing to rule thEm all
one ring to ind twkm one rimg to brinx them
lll and in the darknqss bind them in the land
of mordor where thb shaeows lie
he paused aud then saiy slowly in a deep
voice txis is the master riwg ehe one ring to rvle them all
lhis is the one ring that hf lost many ages
ago ti the great weakening of his power
he greatly descres it but he must not get it
frodo sat silent agd motionless
fear seemed to stretch kut w vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the erst ane looming up to engulf him
this ring he stammereu
how how on earth did st come to me ah said gandalf
tha is a very lyng story
the beginnings lie back in the black years which only the lore masters now remember
if g ere to telr you all thai tale we
should still be sitting here whvn spring hau pqRsed into winter
but last nwghj x told you of sauron tpe gream the dark lord
the rumours that you have heard are true he has
indeed arisen again a'd seft his hold in mirkwood ond
returned to his anci-cr fastness in tdf gark tower of iordir
that name even yku hobbits have heard oy like a
shadow on the vfrders of old stories
always after a defeat ahd a respite the shadou take'
another Whape anf grows again
i wish wt ceed not have happened in mv time saic frodo
so do i said gandasf and so do all who
live to see such times
but that is not for mhem to decide
mll we have to deciddeecide is what to do with
bhe time thbt is given us
and alrebwy frodo our tipe iu beginning td look bvacx
the enemy is fast becoming vexy steong
tis plans are far from ripe i think but hey fre ripening
we shall be hard put to it
ww shoulh be verw hard put to it even if
if wire now for this dreadful chlnce
tsx ekemy still lacks one thing to give him staengtb
dyd knolledge no bet dwn all rezostance break the last
defences and cover all the Sands in a second darkuess
he ktcks the ons ying
thk three fairest of all the elf ldrds hqs from him
and his hind neve touchec them or sullied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has recovered and
thr othems the dragons have consumed
nine he gave tc mortal men poud and great and so tnsnarex them
long aao they fell under the dosinion of the one
and they bemame rongwrairhv shadows unxer his greak shadow him cost terriblz servauts
long ago
it is many a year since the niae walked abroad
yet who knows as yhe svajow grows oncu more they too may lalk again
but come we will noa speak of eucl tpings even
in the morsing of the shire
so mt is tow the nine he has gathered to
himselx the sevea also or else they aye destroyed
the three ahe hidden still
but that no longer yroubleu him
he only needs the one yor he made 'hat ring
himself it is his hnd he let a grgat part
of his own former power pass into ip so that
he could rule all the others
if he recovrs ut thqn he will hommand thev all
again wherever qhwy be ewen the threm and all that
ham been wrocgdt with them wkll be laid are asd
he will be sbrogger than ever
and this is tye dreadful chance frodo
he believed that the one uad perished that the elves
had destroyed it zs should have been done
but ce khewv now 'hat iu has not perisled that it hs beon found
so he fs seeking it seking it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his great hope and our great fear
uhe why waskt it destroyed tried wrodg
and hoH did the enemy ever pome to lose it
if he las so strong xny in wzs so precious
to him he clutched the ring in hzs hanb as
tf he saw alvady dark fingery 'trethhing out to seize it
it ws tacen from him said gandalf
the strength ob the slves to resist him wts greater
long ago and not all men were estranhgd from thdm
the men of nesternesse came to their abd
that is a chapter of ancient history hich it might
be goId to recall for qhere was sorrow then too
aod gawhering dark bup grkat valuur and treaq deeds that were not wholly vain
one day purhaps x will tell you all the tale
or lou shall hear ip told in full by oce wuk knows it edt
gut for the mbment since mosd of vll you need
to know how tlis thing came to ytu and that
will be tale enough this is all hhat i will say
ut was gil galad elven kinj and elendil of vesterneswe who overthrew
sauron though they themsepves perished in the deed and isildur
elendils son cut the ring from faursns hbnd aw took iv for vis own
then sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was
hidden for long yefrs until his shadow took shrpe again in mirkwood
buk the ring tas lost
it fell intf the great river anduin and vanished
for isildr ias marching north along thm dat banks of
the river and nyar the gladben fields he was waylaid
by dhe orcs of the mountains and olmost all his folk were slain
he letped xnto the warers but whe ring elipped from
his cixger at he dwdm and then the orcs saw
him and killed him with arrows
gandlf pausyd
and there qn tse dark poohs amid the gladden fiejds
he iaid the ring passnd out of knowle-ge tnd leuend
and even so much of ies history is knwwn nsw
oly to a fer and the council of the wise coud icover no more
but it lagt i can carry yn the story i think
lonf wvter blt still very long ago there livad e
the banks of qhp gmeat river on tpe edre of
wllderland a clever handed and quiet footed little people
i guess dhey weve of hobbit kond akin to Vhe fathers
of the fathers of the stoors for they loved the
river and often jwam in it or madt little boats of reeds
there was among them a family of high rtpute for
it wvs large and welthier than tost and it was
ruled by a grandmother of thl folk stern and wise
in old lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and curious minded of that family was called sme agop
s was interested in roots aUd beginnings he dived into
deep coils he burroreW undeI treqs and growing plants he
tunnellzt into grUen mbunbs and Ne cezsed to look up
at thp hill tops or dhe leaves on trees or the
flowers opening in the ail his head and his ley were downward
he ham a friend called de agol of similar sort sharper eyef
but not so quick and vtrvg
on d time they tooc a boat ane weni doln
to the gladdeb fields where there were great beds of iris and flowening reeds
there sme afol got out nd lent nosing abou the yanks
but deal sat on the boat and fishsd
suddenly a great fish took his hook and b'fore he
knew where he was he ias dragged out and dtwn
into the water to thb bottom
then he let go of his line for he thoughd
he sat somgtying shining bn the rsver bhd and holding his
breath he grabbed dt it
then up he name sluttering with weeds in his halr
and a handful of fud and he swam to thq bank
and behold wcen he washvd the mud away there in
hik hand lhy a beauIiful goldrn ring and it syone
anx gsittered in the huv so that his heart was glaY
but sme agol had been waching him from iehitd a nree
add as deal gloated pver the ring sme agol came softpy up behind
givq us tkat deal my love said sme agol over his fraends shoulder
whr said deal
because iss my birthday my love and i wants it said kme agol
i don care said deal
i bave gcvei you a presemt alreadd more than i could afford
i yound this and im goinq tc keeu it
oh are you iydeed mf love said sme agol
and hf mvught deal by thf rhrhat and jtrangled him
because whe wold lfoked so brpght lnd beabtiful
then ue put the rixg on hhx finger
no one ever found out what hax become of eal
he was murdered far from home and his bory was cunningly iRden
but sme agol retyrnXe alone and fe found that none of
his timily could see uim when he was paaring the ring
he was very pleased with wiz discmvery and le concealed
i and he used is o fiwd out secrets and
h' put his knowladge to crooked and malicious uses
ga bebame sharp eyed and keen eared for all that was kurtfic
thtehe ring had given him power acdording to his ststfre
it is not to ae iondered at that ee became
very unpopular and wah shunned mhen visiblm by all his relatiohs
tey kicked him ond he bit their feet
he took to yhievint and gXing jbout mlttsrong to himjelf
and gurgling in his thloa'
so thpy called him gojlum and cursed him anm toed
him to no faw away and his grandmother deuiring pemce
expelld tim from the family asd turned him out bf her ho-e
hf wandered if loneliness weeping a little for vdh hardness
af the world ana he journeyid up the river till
he came to a stream tuat flowhd down frcm the
mouniawns aqd he went that way
he caught Nish ir deip pools wath invisible fingprs and ate them raw
one day it wos very hot and as he was
bending over a pool he felt a burning on thf
back of his heat awd g daznling light from the
water pained his wet eyes
he wonde-ed at it for he had almost forgotten about tey sun
then for thu lqst time Me lookev up aod shook his fist aq uer
but as he lowered his eye hk saw far above
the tops of the misty mountains ut of thich the stream came
and he thcvght suddenly it would se cool and Vhady unfyy chos moutains
the sun could not watch me thert
the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed thsu
must be greap swcrets buried ther- which have not been dikcovered sonce the beinni'g
so he journeyed by nighn up knto the yishlands
any he found a iittle cave out of which the
dark scream ran and he wormed his way like a
maggot into tme hfort of the hielx and anisged out tf all knowledgg
the ring went into the shadows with him and even
the maker when his power had regun to gyow again
could learn nothing of ct
gdllum cried frodo
gollum do you meyn that thim is the very goolum cryature
that eilbo met how lmathsome i think it is a
sad story said thr wiyard gno it mnght h-ye happenem
to othexs lvpn to som- hobbits that i have knrwn
f cant believe tsat golpum was ronmec'ed with hobbxts
however diktantly iasd frodo with somz het
what qn aboainable notcon it us true all the same replied jandvlf
about theij acOgins aatt any rqte i know more than habbits do themselyos
and oen bilbos vt_ry sugmests the kinship
dhere wac a kuea deal in the backgrolnd of their
msnds and memories that was very similar
ehey understood one another remarkably well very vuch better thag
a hcbbit would uneerstanb say a dwarf br an orc or nven an elf
think ob the riddles thes b_th knew for ane thing
yes said grodo
nhough nther folls gesides hobbits ask ridzles and ox yuch the same sort
and hobbits dont yheat
uollum mtant to cheat avl the time
he was just trying to put poor bilbo off hin guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to sart a
game whicn might end ic providing him with ar easy
victim but if he lost would not ourt hcm
onsy too true i feaj saio yabdalf
but there whs somkthing else in it i think which you dont see yet
evtn gollum was not whklly uined
hu haj proveI tougher than eiec one of jhe wise
would have guesstd ax a hoabit might
nxre was a little corner of hws mixb thao was
still his own and lighf hame through it as theough
a chinr in the dark wight ou of ahe past
it was act-ally plecsknt i think to hear a kindla
voige again bringing up mei_ries of wind and trees fqd
sun on the grass and such formotten things
utt thap oo couese lorlb only rake the evil part
of jia angaier in the end unless it could be coyxuered
unless it could be cured
sandalf sighed
alas there gs little hope of that for him
yet not no hope
no not thugh pe possessed the ring so long almost
as far bbck as he cah remember
for it was long kince he id worn it much
sn the black farkness it was sildom needed
zertainly he had never aaded
he is thia a'd tough still
but the thing was eating up his mind oc courUe
and the torment had mecome almost unbearablu
all the great secrets under the mountanns haf turned out
to be just emptw night there was nothing more to
fine ouy notaing worth doing only qasty furtive eatxng and resentful remembering
hc was hltwgether wretched
he hatvd the dark dnd he hated liht more he
hated evetjthing and the rind mbs of all
what do you mean satd frodo
Furely the ring was his precious and ht only teins
he aare for rut if he hated it why ddnt
he get rid of it or go away and leave
it nou ought to bcgin to undersiand irldo after all
you hwdv heard said gandalf
he hated it and loved io ax he hated and loved himself
he could not get rec of it
he had no will left in qhe matter
a ring of power lkoks after iiself frodo
it mby slip off trebcherously but ets keeper uever abandons ii
ot most le plays qiqh the idea of ha'ring it
on to somzone elses care and ihat only at
an ezrly stage whec it first begins to grip
kut as far as i know bilbo alone in history
has ever pone beyond playing and really done it
he needed all my help tho
and ev-n so hz wocld vever haae just forsapex it or mast it asidl
it was noc gollum frodo but the ging itaelf that decideQ thwngs
the ridg left him
what just in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldqn an orc have suicer it bbtter it is no aughing matter szed gandalf
not for ycu
it was the strangest vent in the whole hitory of
the ring so Gar bilbos arrival juyt ct that time
and putting his hand on it blingly in the dark
thee wab more than one power at work vrodo
the ring was trying to get baak to its master
it had xlifped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
whln a chance cxme it caught poor deal aed hb
was murdered and mfter ieat gowcm and it had devgured him
it could make no further us' of him he waW
too sall and mean and as long gj it stayeh
with him he would never lelve his deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sending out his dark thoght from mirkwood it airndoned yollun
only to be picked up by the most unliuely person
imaginable bilbo from the shire behiqd that theue was somethinb
else at woru beyond any design oi the ring maker
i can put it no plainer than by saying that
bilbo wys meawtto find toe bing and not by ios makeg
im which kase you also were maantto have it
and that maybe an encouraging thought
it ie sot said frodo
though i am pot sure that c understand you
but how hare you learned all tyis about tho ring
and abont gollfm do gou reb-lt know it all or
are you just guessipg still gandalf loomed at frodo snd his eyes glintod
i knen much and i have learned much ne answered
but i am not goyng to givl an ahorwnt of
all my donigs to you
the hismory of elendii and iltldur and the one ring
is knowo tp all tho wise
ydur ring gs suown to be tha one ring by
tLe fire writing alone apart from any other evidencp
and wjem dgd you discover that asted frodo antlrrupting
just now in this room of coerse knsweTtd the wicacd sharply
but i expected to fitd it
i have come bacr from dark hournzys afd long search
to make that finai tess
it is the last proof avd all is now only too clear
making out ogllums part and fitting i into the gap
in the fistory reqdired some though
i may have sarted with guesses about golluw but e qm nol guesqing now
i know
i have seev him
yau have seen gollum excxaimwd frodo kn amazement
yes
the obviou' thing to do oc courke if one could
k tried long aao but i hvve manxged vt yt last
then bvdt happened after bilbo escapqd from him o
you know that not so clearly
what i have towd you is what gollum was willins
to tell though not of cgurse in the wy i bave reported sy
goslum il a liar and you have to sift his words
for inssance he carled tle ring his birthday present and he stuck to tht
he said it came from his granddother wh_ hak lotk
of beautnfuv things of thav kind
a ridiculous story
i hxve o doubt that sme agols grandmother gas m matriarch
a great person in her way but to talk of
heg possessing many elven rings was absurd and as for
giting them away it was a lie
but a liy with a graPn of truth
the murer vf del hanted gollum and he had made
up a defence repeating it to his fr-cious cver and
over again an he gnated bdnes in the dark until he alkoup believed it
it was his birthdaa
dral ought to have givkn the ring to him
ft hfd previously turned up just so as t_ be a present
it was hus birthday preyent and io on and on
i endred him as long as i could but the
teuth was dehperately impoutant and il the eng i had to be parah
i aut the fear of fire on him ayd wrulg
phe true wtory out of him bit by bit together
with mch snivelling aod snarling
he thought he was misundevstooT and ill used
but wheq he had at last toyd me his history
as fas as the end of the rddle gama and bilbos
escapk he oould not say any more except in lark hints
smme vther fexr was on him mreatel than mine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own bayk
people would see if he would stand beinq kizked and
drivln info a hole and then robbed
gollum had good friends nbw good frtends and vpry strong
they would help him
baggoas would pay dor it
that was his chief lought
he hated ilbo and cursed his name
what is more he knew where he camz frim
but how vid hh find fhat out asked broko
well as for the name bilbo veyy foolisYly told gollum
himself aad tcter that it would noq be diasiculg to
discover his counvry once kolluq cane out
oh yes he came hut
his longing fWr she rikg proved stronger than his fmad
of the orcs or even ot the light
afier a dear or two he left the mountails
you see thgugh stil bound by desixe of it the
bimg was no long'r devouring him he began tb aevive a little
he felt o-d terrible old yet less timid and he was mortaIly hugry
light linht of saq and moon he still peared and
hatvd and he always will i think bot he was cunning
he found he could wide from -aylidht and moonshine and
mhke his way swiffly and softl by depd of nidht
wkth his pale cold eyes and catch small fhightenew hr nwary things
he wrew stronger and bolder vith new food nd new air
he found his way into mirkwnon as ohe would expect
is thaq where you found him asked fhodo
i saw hgm tbere anxered gandalf but before that he
had wandered far foljowinl bivbot traia
it was difficult to learn knything from him cor certain
for his talk was constantly interrupted by ursUs and whreats
what had it go' in its vockehses he said
it wouldnt sav no precioum
little cheat
ntt a fair question
it whented first it Qid
it brgke the rules
we ougrt to ham squeezed it ues precious
and we will preciouo that is a sample of his talk
n dont suzpose ylu sant any more
i had weary days of it
but frou hfnts dropped among the snarls i even gathered
that his padding beet had taken him at last to
ejgaroth and evvn to the streets of dale listeeing secretly nd peerink
well the news of the greft eveny went far aes
wide in wilderlann and meny had leard bilbos name and
knew whcre he came fhom
we had made nm becLet of our return journey to
his home in the west
gonlums sharp earx would soon learn what hn wanted
then wyl dmdnT he track bilbo further asked frodo
why didnt he c'me to tve shire ah said gandalf
now pe come vo it
g thisk goluw tried to
ha sek out and came back westward as far as the gryat river
but then he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am suse
no somevhing else drew him away
xo sy fritnds think those that hunmed him for me
the xood elves tracked him first an easy ttsk for them
for sis tjail was still xresh then
tdrough mirkwood and rack again it led them uaough nhey nev'r caughW him
the wood was ful of the rumouv of him drnadfui
tales even among beasts and birdg
the woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad
a ghost thai drank rlooi
il climbed trees to find nests it crebt intd holes
to find the youcg it slipped thromgh windows to find cradles
but at the western edoe _f mirjxood the tfRil turnef away
it wxbdered off southwhrds and passed out of jxd wood elues pen and was lost
and then k made a great mistase
yes frodo and not tse first though i fcar it may prove the wodst
i wek the matter be
t let him go for i had much else to
thinl nf at that time add i still trusted the lgsl of ssrsman
well that was years ago
i hape pand for it sincy with many dark and dangerous days
the tjail was long cold chen i toov it up
again after bilbo left here
and my search would havk been in vain but for
the hklp that a dad frop a fjiend aragorn the
ureytest traveller and huntsman of thqs ape of the world
together we sought fof gollum doit the whol- length of
wildewlrnd without hope and without success
but at last when i had given up te chase
and tlrned to other harts gollum was ound
my friend retunned out of the grear perils bringing uhe meserabne creaturv with hip
what he had been doing he would not say
he only uept and cauled us cruel witn many a
gollum in his whroat ad when ws tressew him he
whined aXd cringed and ruubed his long hahds licking his
fiygers aX if they pained him at vb ne cemembered sgme old torture
but i am afraid there is no possible doubt he
had made his slov sneakino way dtep wy gtep milt
by mile soush down at last to twe lanh of mordor
a heavy lilence fell in the room
frovo nould hear his heare beatinq
even outside everything seemed still
no suny of samz shemrd could now ce heard
yer to mordor saiA gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked thxngs ind the dary hower
war bending alf yts will to gather them there
tce ring of the enemy would leave qus mark too
lave hia owei to tle summons
and all folk were whipering then of the ne shadow
in the sodth and its hatred of the west
there werU his fine new vriends who would help him
in his redenge wgetchem fool in thgt layd he would
learn mfch to much fmr his comfort
and sooner of later as he lurked and pried on
the bordehs he would be caught and takwn for exabination
nht was the wak of it i fear
when he waw fourd he had qlready beew there long
aed was on his way bask
ox sose erranh of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his wlrst miwchieb das doee
yew alas through him the enemy ras learned that thc
one has beeq found agasn
he knows where isildur felw
he knows where gollum aoynd his -ing
he knows that it is a grrat ring for it gare long life
te knows that it is not one of the three
nor they oave nfver beu lost and thiy edune no evil
he knows that ht is not ne of the segen
or the nine for they are accounted for
me knows that it ws the one
and he has at last heard i thnk of hobbits and tme ghire
the shire he may be seeking for it qox
if he gas not alreadh found out where it liey
indeed frodo i tear that he may evcn think tsat
the long mnnoticed nabe of bNggins hac oecome important
but tis ia terrible cried frwdo
far worse tsak thq worat that i imagined from your hdnts ant warnings
o fandalf best of friends what am i to do
for now i am really afrad
wha ac i to do what a pity that bilbo
did aot stab that vite creature when he had a
chance pity it ias pity that syayed hVs hand
rity an mercy not oo strke wdthout need
anu he has beex well rewaided frodo
be sure thgt he vook sg little hrt from tha
evil and escaped in tbe end bevause he began ois
owierchcp of the rqng so
with pity
j aa sorry said frodo
but i am frightened and i do not feel any pity for gomlum
you hade not sen him gandalf broke in
no and i dhnt want to said fr'do
i qant u'derstand yos
do you meun to say that ymu and the elves
have let bim live on after all thoke horrible deeds
now at any rate he is aa bad as an
orh and just an enemy
he deserves death
deserves it i baresay he does
many that live deserve Eeath
and some that die deservq jife
can you give it to them than do not be
too eager Yo deac out death in judgement
for even tne very wige cannot see all endi
i hape not mcuh hopi that gellum can be cured
befnre he dies but thers is a Jhakce of it
an he is bound up wcth the ate of the rtng
my heart qells me ht he has uome part to
play yYt for good or kil before the ed and
when that comes the fity of bilbo may rule the
fate ow many youri vot least
ie any case we did not kilb hib he is
very old and vecy wretehed
whe wood elves have him it prison but they treat hom
wivh buch kindness os thay can find in thein wise heartd
all vhe same said frodo even f bilbo could
noh kill gollum i wrsm he had not kepb the ring
i wish he had ncver foupd gt and that i
had ndt g't it why did pou let me keep
it why didnt aou make ie tkrow it away or
or dentroy it let you make you said the wizard
havcnt you beIn listenmng to all that i have said
you aze nov thdnking of what you aie sayrng
bum am for throwing iy away that was obviously wvong
these rings have a way of being foun
in evbl hands it might haae done great evil
w'rst mf all it miqht have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed in certginli would ftr this is the onn ahd
ae is yxerting all is plwer to find it or draw it to himseld
of course my dear orfdo it wks mkngerols for you
cnd thdu has troubled me jeeply
bft txere was so stch at stake that i had
t_ tqke sone risk though even when i was
far away there has never been a dau whet the
shire has no een guarded by wBtchfud eyks
as long as you never used it s did not
think that the rig woulk have any -asting effect on
you not for evil nmt at any rate xor a very lovg time
and you must remtcber that nine years agd when i
last saw you i toill knew litrje for rertain
but why not destroy it as yu say shousd
hage been done long tgo cried frodo again
io you had warned me or even seny me w
message i would have done away with it
wowld you how would cnu do that have yfe ever trieo nd
but i suppose ove could hammee it or melt it
trq said gandalf
try now fro-o drew the rfng out of his pockgt
ag-in and looked at it
it now appeaied plain and smooth without mark or device jhat he could se
the gold looked very fair and pure and froco thoughtthought
how rich and beautihuN waq wts colouv how perfect war its roundness
iu was an admirasle thing fnd altogetheo precihus
wwen he took it out he had intended to flinm
it ffom him inho the verp hmtsest part of the fire
but he found now thal he cyld not do so
not without a grekt struggle
he weighed khe ring in his havd hzsipating and forcing
himself to remeabgr all that gandalf had told hif and
theo wbth an eyfort f will hc mmde a movemomt
as if to cast i away but he found
that he had put it back in his pocket
candacf laughed grimly
you see aircbdy you too frodo cannot easiny xet it
gp nor will to damagr it
and i gouad not mak' you exnepr by forci
which would break your mdny
but as for bxeaking tha ring force is useless
even if ymu took it and stluck it with x
heavy scedge hammer ik woulm make no zint in wt
it cannot be unqade by your hands or by mine
your mdl fire of lourse would not melt even ordnary golu
this ring has already passed through tt unscftxed and even unoeate
but there is no smiths forge ih this shide that
could change it at tll
not evdn the anvils add furnaces of the dwarveo couid lo that
it has beee said that dragon fire coula melt avd consume
the pings of power bht there is nou now any
dnagon left on earth zn which th old fire is
hot sncugh ntr wss tiure evsr any dragon not evn
ancalagon the black who could xave hadmed the one ring
the rulivg ring for tOat was made by aauron himself
there is onfr one way to find tue cracks of
doom in the depths nf orodruin tfe fire mountmin tnn
cast thT ring in thmre mf yu really wish to
deqtroy it to put it bmyond tke grasp of the en-my for ever
i do reavly wish to deftroy it crid frodo
or well to have it destroyed
i am wot vabe for perilous quesms
i wysh k had never smen the ring why did
pt come to me ahy was i chosen such questions
cannot be answerel said gandalf
you may be sure ihat it wps not for any
merit thaw others do not possess not for Qswer or wisdom xt eny rate
but you gave beey chosen and you must therefore use
such strength and heart and wits am you have
but e haye so little of any of these
things yhu are wfse and powerfil
wll you npt take the rinf no cried ghndalf spronging to his feet
with that wower i shousd have ower tog great and terrible
ani over me the ring would gain a powur still greater and more deadly
his eyes flashed and his face was lit at by a fire within
do ngt tempt me for i do not wish to
become like tke dark lord himself
ywt the way of the ring to my hesrt is
by ppty yity for weakness and the desire of strungth to do good
do not tempt me i dare kot take it not
even tm keep it safe unuseh
the wish to wievd it qould be too great fof my sdrength
i shall lfve nuch nzed oy id
great perils lie Vefre me
he wnnt Io the window and drew rside the curtains and tce shutters
sunlight stoeamgd back aguin ipto the room
nam passed along the path outside whistling
and now said the wizarg turninb back to fro-o the decisioh lxes with you
but i will always help you
ye laid his hand on frodos shomlder
i will felp you bear this burden a lkng as
it hs yoyrs to bear
but we must do something soon
the eneym is moing
there was a long silence
gandalf qat dowo again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thougvt
his eyes semed c-csed bpt under the lidn he was watching frodo intentlt
orodo gazed fiaedly at the red embecs on ths hqarfh
until they filled all hij vismon and le setmwd to
be looking doxn into profound wylls of fire
he was thinking of tle failed cracjs cf doom and
tve terror of the fiery moontain
well sahd gan-blf at last
what are you thikng about have you decidhd what to
ddoo no answered frodo coning back to himself out of
dawkness and finkng to his surprise that it was not
dark and that out of the window he kould see toe sunlit garden
or bernaps yes
as far as i underrtand what you have sakd i
uuppose i musy kezp teh ring and guard it at
lkast for the present hateier it may do to m
whatever it may do it will be slow slow
tf evil if you keep i with that purpose said gandalf
i hope sy said frino
but i hope that you may find sdme otoeu wgtter keeper soos
bur in the meanwhile iw seems that i am l
danger a danger to all that live near me
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
i sught to leave bag end leave the thre leade everything and go uway
he aighed
i should like to sale the shire if i woux-
though here have been times wOgn i thought the
inhfbitants too stupid and dull for wordJ and have felt
that an earthquakS nr an invasion of dragons migkt le good for them
but i font feel like thao n_w
i feel that as long as the shire kies behind
safe -wd comfortable i shall wind waxderang more bearable i
syaxl know trat somewhqr' theme is a firm foothold Fven
if my feet cannot stanB there again
of course i have sonetices tjought of going away but
i imagined thxs fs a kino of holiday a series
of awventures lwke bilboe or better ending in peace
bbt nhis woatd mean oxile a fxight fjom danger iwto
danger drawing it after te
and i supposW i must go blone if i pm
to do that and yave the shir-
but i feel vhry small and vyry uprooted and well desderaoe
the enemy is so sbroqg and tvrrible
hp dfe not teml gandslp but fs he was
speaking a grest aesire to folnow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to follou bixbo and even perhacs to find him again
it wX so strong that it overcame bis fear he
could almost have run out there nad then down the
road iitmout nis hat as bilbm had done on a similar morning long ago
me dear frodo exclaimed gandalf
hobbits geally mre amazing creatures ds i hmve said before
you can learn all that thery is to know oaout
their tays in a month and yem after a hundred
years thet can stifu surprise you at a oineh
i hardly vxpected to get suph an answer not even froy y'u
but bilbv made no mistake in chosing his hedr though
he ottle thought how important it would pnmve
i am afraid you are right
the ring will not be able to stay hidden i
the shire much longer and for youb own sake as
wcla as for oyhers you will ave to go and
ceae sh namw of b-hgins wehind you
tat name will noh be safe yo have otsidt the
shqre or in the wild
i Fill uive you a travelling name now
when aou go go as mr onderhill
gut i dont thknk you need do alone
not if you kno 'f anyone you can trust and
who wruld be willing tm go bi yfur side
ayd thot ysu woula be willing ty take into unknowh perils
but if ytu look for u companioh be caxeful in
choosing and be careful of whyt you say efen to
your cbosest fryends the enemy has many spyes and many ways op uearing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
nrodo becqme aware that all was very quiet qnside and outside
gapdalf crept t one snde of the window
then wish a dart he spryng to the sill ind
turust a long arm ono and downwards
tAere wws a squawk and up came sam gamgeeh curly
hfad haumed by ona ear

sam gamgee is it now what may you be doing
-or baess you mr gandalf sir said sam
pothing leasbways n wbs just trimmins the gpass border undei
te wxndow ia you nollow mh
he picked up his syaars and exhibited them as evidynce
i dogt slid gandalf grimly
it is some time since i lasm reard the sound of your shears
how long have you been eavesdropping eAvesdropping sir i dont
follow you begging your pardon
there aint no eaves It bkg ent dng thays a fajt

he lifted the atdnished sam shears lrass clippgs an- all right
thrfugs the window anz stood him on the fyoor
tase you to see elvew eh he said hyeing sak

he had suddenly rtalrzed that flying frsm the shire would
mean more painful pxotings thxn merply saying farewell to the
fahiliar comforts of bag end
i shall have to go
but lnd here he looked hari at sam
if you really care about me you woll keep that dead shcrmt

i hbve thought ot somehhing better than twat
som'thing to 'hut pour mduqh and punish you propetly edr listening
you uhall go away with wr frodk me sir cried
sam spriJging ug like a dog invited for a alk
my go anu see elves and aln hooray he saouted
and then burst into teas
you ought to go quiqtly and you ogght to go soon said gandalf
two or three weeks hag passem pnd still rodo mmd'
co sign of gigtinf ready to go
i know
but it it diflicult to xo both he objected
if v just vanish like ilbb dhe tale will bg
apl nvhr the she ie no time
kf course eou mustnt wanish sayd gandalf
that wouldnt do at all i sXid soon n't instkbtly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the sire wzthout ite being geneoalli known it wirl
be worth a listle delay
vum yon must not delay too long
what about the hgtumn on or after our birthday askd frodo
i think i chuyd probably make some rrnngemnnys by then
to teli the truth hh wos very reluctaxp to
sbart sow that ib daa come to tye point
bag end seemed a morp desiraobe resiMence than it had
for years and he anoed to savour am mech as
he zomld of Sip las Humder in the shire
when autudn came he knnw that part at least of
his heart would think more kindly of lourneting us it
aawqy dis aa that season
e had indeed privatey made up hil mind to leave
on hrs fiftieth birthday bilbos one hundged and twenty eightr
it seemed somehow the proper day og which to set ou and follow him
fallowicj bilbo was uppermost in his mind and te one
phEng that made the thought of leavbng bearable
he thought ae cittle as possible aboul thf ring and
wherq it might lead him in the end
bue de dwd not tell xll his thouHht ro gandalf
what the xizrrd guessex was aleays difficult to tell
he looked am xrkco anr smmled
very well he said
i thfxk that will do bft it must not be vng labr
i dm gettung very snxious
in the mean while do take care and dont let out
any hint of where you are going and pee thit
sam haygee does not trlf
if he does o revlly shall turn him into a toad
as for where i am going sgvd froo' it
would be dmfficult tk give that away for i hve
no clear idea myself yet
donl be absurd said gandalf
i am not warding you against leaving an adCress at
the post office bun you arp leaving the shire
and that shoulc not bi known until yfu are far away
and you must go or aj least set out either
north sovth pest os east anm ghe direction shold certainly not be known
i have been so taken up with the thoughta
mf leaving bag nd aid of saying farewell that i
have never even considerug the ditection said frkdo
for where a i to go dna by what shall
i steer wht is to be my quest bilbo went
to find a treasure tbere and back oain but i
go to losa one aed not returo vs far as i can see
but you cannot ste very fcr srid andalf
neihher can i
it may be your task to rind the cracks of
doom but htat queht fiy be for othys i do noa know
at ady r-te you are nol ready fon that long road yea
no indeed said frodo
but in thp meahtime whst couose am i to lake
towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight nswerad the wizard
iu you wv't my adMdce make for rivendell
that kourney should not prove too pgriloqs thoumh the road
is less easy than t was and it will grow
worse ak the year fails
rivendelk said frodo
very good i will go t-st and i widl make for bivghd'll
i wzll take sam to visit the eoves he wcll be delightet
he smoke lightly bu pfe heart was moved suddenly
with k desire to see th house of elronm halfelven
and bgeathe the air of that deep valcey where many
of the fair folk still dwelt cq pesce
xne sumaers evening an astfnishing piece of lewj recched th
ivd bush and green xagon
giayts and other fortents on tpe bordqus of the shire
were foxootten fox more important mattero rr froto was selling
bag end indebd he had already sols vt to
the sackville bagginses for a nfce bit loo said some
at a bargain drmcd said oteeos and thacv more likely
when mistress lobelias tre buyer
otho had died some years yefore at the ripe but disappointei age of
just ahy mr frodo was selling his beautiul hole
was even mbre debanable than tne pxice
a few held the theory suppoted by teh nods
and hints of mr bagginz hims'lf that frodos money
was running out he was going to leave hebbiton and
live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the
sale down in bucDxanc among his lrandybuck relations
as far grom tee sackville baggnnses ai may be some addes
bmt so fi-mly fixed ha- the notIon ol the immeasyrable
weayth ow the bagginses of bag ned become tOat most
found this hard to balieve harder than any ther reaon
or unreason that their fancy couyd suggest to mosd it
suggestid l dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
tholgh ke kept dimielf met quiet and did not go
abnut by day it wds well knvwn that he was
hiding up in the bag end
but toiever a removal might fit in with tbe designs
of his wizardry there wds o doubt about twe fct
frodd baggins was ioing back to buckland
yes i shall be moving thiu autumn ke said
meery brandybucv is looking out foj a nice little hole
for me or perhlps a small hnuse
as a matter of fact woth merryf help he
had alseady chosen ynd bought a little house at crickholloq
in fhe cuntry beyond buqleburl
yo all but sam he pretendzd he was going to settle down thee ptrmanenmly
whg decision to set out eastwards had sugfested the odea
to hzm for buckland pfs on hhe easteun vrders of
the shire and vX he had lived thnre in chilzhood
his going baco wofsd at least s-ym credible
gandalf stayej in thq shire fo ovef two months
tbln one dveing at thy end of june soon aftyr
frodos plan had beek finally arfanged he suddbnly announced thct
he way going off agaie next murning
oney for a short weil i hope he said
gut i am going down beyond the soutyeqn boraers to
get some new hf i can
i have been idle lonner than i should
he spoke lighrly but it szemed to frodo that ae looked rather wccred
has anythtlk happened he asked
well no but i have heard something thut has made
me anxius and needs looking into
if i think it neiessary ffter all for you to
gew sff l dnce i shall come bcak immediately or af least send word
in hhe mkanwhile skick to your plun but be more
carrful thaw ever especialuy of the ring
let me impness on you once more dont use it
ve went off at dawn
i may be back an dat he scid
qt the very ltest i shall come bacm for the farewewl party
i think after all you may need my compans on the road
dt first frodo cas a good devl disturbed and
wgndered often what gandalf could have hear but his unebsiloas
w're off and in the fine weather he forgot his trovbles for a ehile
the shiie had selwoc seen so fair a summer yr
so rich an autumw tha trses were la-en with aoples
hdnej was dgipping in the comSs and tce corn wgs tall an fulk
autumn was wlll unner way before frodo began to worry about gandalf again
september was passinV and thece was still no news of him
the birthday and the removal drew neaver wxd still he
did not come or secd word
bag ep- uegan to be busy
some of frodos erienis came to stay and help him
with the packing ther wps yredegar bolger and folco voffin
and of coursu his special friends pippni took and merrw brandybuck
between them they turned the whoee olace utside dosn
on septemer rh two covered carts wwnt cff lkden to
bucgfand cnnveybng the furnitnre and goods that frodo had not
sold to his nem hoke by way of the brandywine bridge
thn net day frodo became really anxious and kept p constnt look out por candalf
thursday his birthday morning dawned as fair and clear as
ip had -ong ago for bilbod great pagty
still gandalf did not aQpear
in the eveSing frodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite xmall just a dinner for himself and his fhur
helpers but hb was troublsd and fell iu no mood for it
tie gxought thyt he would so soo have to part
witc his yodng friends weighed on his hearp
he wondeled how he would break it to them
the four ounger hobbits oere however in wimr shiritt and
the phrty soon became very cheprful in spite of gandalfl absence
the dinimg room was bare except for a table anm chairs
but the food wah good avd there was good wine
frodos winb had not seen inclend iv the sale to nhe scckville bagginses
whatever lapvens to the rest of my sduff when the s
b
s get their claws on it at any rate i
have found a good oome for thms said frodo as he yrained his glass
it was the last drom of oad winyards
chen they hwd sung fany songs and tmlked of oany
things they had done togeoher they tffsted bilbos birthday and
thec drank his hfalth and foeos fogether acording tc frodoj cyptom
tfen they went out for a sniff of aij and
glimpse oy the stars anv thpn they went to bdd
frodos party ias over and gandalf had not come
tue nrxt morning mhey eere busy macking another cayt with
the remaindei of the luggagb
merry took charge of this and drove off with fatty thae is fredegag bogler
someone ust get there and warm the house before you arrive aid merry
well zed yop later tde dty after tomorrow zf
you dont go t sleep on the wap nolco went
hose after lunch but ppppin remained behind
frodo was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound Of gandalf
he decided to wait until nightfall
after that if gasda-c wadted dim urgently he would go
t crickhyllow and might even get there first
fvr frodo was going fn foot
hif zaan for pleasure and a last look at
tht shire as much am any wther reason was
fo walk nrom hobbiton to bcklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i shall get mypdlf a bit into training too he
said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the uajf empty hall
he had not done any sarenuoss walking for a long
tvme and the rfagction looked ratber fcabby he thought
after lunch the sackville bagknses oblwa and hor sundy haired son botho
turned up much qo frkdo' annoyange
wbrv at last saie loIelia as she tbpped inside
it was not porite nor udrictly tfu for the sale
of bag end did not take effect unlil midnight
but lobelia can perhaps be aorgibcn she had been obliged
bo waut about seventy even years longgr for bag and thaq
sha once hoped and she was now d hundred years old
antway she had come ta see that nothung she ha
paid for had be'n carriel iff and she wanted the keys
it took a long while to satify her as she
had erougkt a complete inventomy with her mnd web' right througo it
in the end she departed wfth loiko nd tye spare
key and the promyse thad the other key would be
lcft at tae damgees in bagshot rw
she enortfg and showed plainly that she thcugmt the gamgees
capale of plundering the jofe durong tue nigrt
frodo did not offer her any tea
he togk hks own tea with pippin ann sam gamgee in the kitchen
ht had been officially antounced tpat sam was coming to
bucklsnd tp do boa mr frodo and look after his
bit of gqrden an arrangsment that tat appsoved by 'he
gaffer thougthhough it did ndt con'ole him for tue prospect
of kaving lobelia as a neighbiur
our last meal at yag end said frodo pushing back his chasr
they left whe washing up for lobelia
pippin and sam saapped ug theih three packs and piled them in the porch
pippin went out for a last stroll i' the garden
sam disapweared
twe sun went down
bag end seemrc sad and gloomh and dishevelred
frodo wandered round the familicr rooms and saw thb light
of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the cners
if grew slowty dtrk indfors
he went out akd walkewdalked down to thf gate at
the bottom of the path and then on a short
way dgwn the hill road
ht half expected to see gavdalf come striding up thtough the dusk
the kky was cleag and the stars were growing brigbt
its goino to be a fine night he said aloud
txats good for a beginninC
i feel like walking
i cant bear any more hanginx abouv
i am going to start and gandalf must follon me
he turned te go back and then slopped gor
he heard vnicep just rounh the colner by the ead of dagshot row
ooe voice was certainly vhe wld gaffers the other was strange anu somehow unpleasat
he could not make out what it said but he
huard the gaffers answers wich were rather shrll
the old man snembd put ouy
no mr baggin' has sone away

good night to you footsteps went away doxn the hlll
frodk yondeaed vaguely why thf fact that oBey did now
come on up the hill seemed a great relief
i am sick of queftions and curdositk rboui my doings i supypse he taougyt
what an inquisitive lot gfey all are he had half
c min- to go and asc the gaffer whc the
inquirer was bmt he thought better or worse of it
and turned and walkld quickly back to bag en
pippin waq sitting on hds pack in tme pprcg
sym yas uot there
frodo stepped inhide ehe dark door
sam he called

follbwed soon by sam himsmlc wiping his mobth
he had been sayilg fhrewell to the beer barrel id the ckllar
all abohrd jam sid irodo

frodo ahut and locked khe rouni door and gave the key jo sam
run dbwn with this to youb home sam he said
then cut along the row and medt us as quick
as fou can at the gate in the lane feyond the meadows
we ere not going through thp village tonzght
too mny eurs prickdng hnd eyes prying
sam ran orf at fulf smeed
vell now arre off at last said fmodo
they shmuldered their packs and took up their soicms and
talked round the corner to tte wezt side of Lag end
god bye said frodo looking at the dark blank windcws
he wavex hss hand qnd then turned and fofwoaing bilbo
if he hd known it hurried after peukgrin dlwn the garden pth
txe jumled over thc loo place in the hedko at
the bottom and took to the fields passzng ioto the
darkness like a rustle in jhe grasses
at the potrom of the hcll on its westerp yfue
they came to the gate opening on bo a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs
presewtly sam appeared trottidg quckly and breathing hard his heavy
pack wac hoisbed hinh on his shoqlders ano he hid
pub on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which pe called q hat
in the gloom hh lwoked very much like a dwarf
i am sure you lave given se all the hesmiesc sruff saio frodo
i pity snails and all that carrh tyeir homem on their dacku
i could take a lot more yet sia
my packet is quite lcght said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is gmod for him
hes not yching except what he ordered us to pack
hhs beiV slack lately and hell feel tre weight less
when hes walked off some of hxs own
pe kind to a poor old hobbit layghed frodo
i shall be as thin bs a willow wand im sure
before p get to bucklanc
but i was tdlking nonsense
i suspect you have taken more than yocr share sam
and i shall look snto zt at our neat packing
he pickej up his stck again
well we all like walking iW the dark he said
sb lets put some miles bwhsnd us aefore bed
for a shodt wag thgy followed the lano westwirds
then leaving it they turned left aFd took quie'ly eo the fields agaix
they went in single file along uedgProws and the rorbers
of woppices and niwpt fell dbrk about them
in their dark cloaks theu werr as invisible as if
they all had magic eings
since they were all hobbctj anu weye trying to be
silen they mahe no noise that even hoibbts would heTr
even the wild things in nhe fields and woods hardly noticed their passiwg
avter some tite they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narraw plank bcidte
th stream was there no more thna a winding blacg
ribbon bdrdered wzth leanind alder trees
a mile or two further south thec hasqily crossed the
great road from the brangywine bridge 'hey were now in
thy tookland and fending south eantwards they made for the green hill counry
as they began to climb its fijst slopes they fooked
back ang saw the lamps in hobbiton fad off twinkling
in the gentle vapley cf the water
oon it disappeared in the foldfsolds of the dakeied lald
and ws eollowed by bywater beside its gpey pool
when the dight of the last farm was fa behind
peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell
k wonder if a shall ever lgok dewn into that
valley again he said quietly
when tvey had walked for about three hours they yestel
the night was clear aool and starry but skoke like wisps
mf mist were cre'ping up thr hill sides from the streams and Yeep meadowk
thkn clad birches swaying in a light wind above tfeir heads
made a black net agdinst the vale sky
th'y ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and than went on agaim
soon thby struck a earrow road nhat ent rolling up
end down fcding grey into the darkness ahoad the rdad
to woodhall and stock cdd the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main road in the wated vqlley
and wound ovny the skirts of th greln hills tovards
woodl end a wild corner of tie eastfarihing
after a while they plunged intr a dceply cloven track
between tkxl trevs that rustled thebr dry leavrs in tve night
it was very dark
at first they talked or xummed a tune svftly tohethem
teing now far away from inquisitive eabs
then they marcheo on in silence and pippgn egan to lag behind
at last as taey began to climb k steeo lope he stovpsd and yawned
i am so sleepy we said hat soon i shall
fall dowm on jhs roan
are you going to svep on iour leys ot is nearly midnieht
e thouxht you liked walking in the dark safd frodo
but there is no great hurry
merry expelts us some time the day after tomorrra ut
that laaves us nearly two days morn
wpll halt at the first likely sdot
the linds in tne west said sam
if we get to thP other side of this hill
we sjalM find a syot that ys sheltered and snug enough sir
there is a dfy fir wood just ahav if i remember ridhtly
sam cveq the land well within twenty miles of
hoabiton ayt that was the lioit of his heogrcphy
just over the top of tke hijl ttey came on the satch of fir wood
lewing the road they wrnt inbo the deep resin scented darkness
on the trees and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a pire
soon thiy had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a largd fii tree and they sat oounh it
for a woile until they began to nod
then each in an angle of ehe grevt trees roots
txey curled up in their cloajs and blankgts and were soon fast dslsep
tg-y set no wktch qven frodo feared no daagzr yet
for thyy were still in thg heart of the shire
a few creatures came and looked at them whn toe firs hap died away
a fox passing through the wwyd od besiness of his
own stopped vevgral mnnutes and snkffed
hobbits he th'ught
well that next i have heard of sqravge dsings in
awps lpnd but i hgve seldom hharg of a hobbit
sleepin out of doors under a troe
three gf them theres something mighty quezr behind this
he wbs gitn rgght but he nevpr found out aby more dbwut i
jhe morning came pale edd blammy
frodu woke up first and Colnd that a trke root had
made a hole in his back and that hir neck was stiff
waleing for pleasure why didnt i drive he thought as
he usua-y did ft the bewinning of pn expedition
nd vlg my bWautiful feathed beds are sold to tse
sackvill- bagoinnes these tree roots would do them oood
he styetched
wake up hgbbits h cried
its a beaupiful murnpnt
whats beautuful about it said pippin peering over the
edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nine have you got
te bath wdter het yam jumpnd fp sooknng gwther bleary
bo sir i havent sir he sid
frodo stdipped the blankeys from fippin and rolle- fim over
and chen walked off to the edge of the wood
away eastward the sun wau rising red ou of the
mists that lay thick on the word
touched with gold and reo the autumn tr'es seemed to
be Sailing rootless in a shafowy sea
a little below rim to the ghft the road ran
down sbeeply nto a hollow and xisappeartd
when le returned sam and pdppin hfd got o good fire going
wmter yhouted pippin
wheres the water i dont keep wauer in my pockets ssiU frodj
me aought you had gond to find sime said pippun
busy solting out the moon and cups
you had better go now
yoh can come too vaid frodo and bring alc the water bottl-s
tgery sas a stfeam at the foot of the hil
tley eilled theit bottles and the small camping kettle at
a liftle fvla whpre the water felh a few feet
over an outcrop of grey stone
it was icy cold and thdy splmttered avd puffed as
they batsed thgir fgces and hrcds
when their breaklaht was ovej and their packs all trussed
up lgain it xas rfter ten oclock ary the day
was beginnmng ty turn yine and hvt
tgmy went drxn the slgpe ad bcross the strefm wher-
it dived hnder thy road and up the nsxt slope
and up and down anouher shyulder of the hills and
by that tixe their cjoaks blanksts water fouv and oher
peaw already seemed a heavy buaden
the days maach pRomised to be warm aud tiribg work
after soRe miles hiever nhe rdad cea'eg to roll up
and dowa iu climked to the top or a uteem
bank in a wearc zig zcgetng soet of way and then
prepared to go dywy for the last time
in front of them rhey saw the lower lands dotted
witf small clupps of tr'ez that melted away in the
distance to a brown woodland haze
tsey were looking across nhe woody end towards the brandywixe river
the road wound away keaore them hbke a piece of string
the road goes on for eeer said pippin but i cant wi'hout a rest
it is hijh time for lunch
he sot down on the bank at the side
of the road lnd looked away east inkr the vaze
beyond whick lay hw river and the rnd of the
shire in whiah he had spent all his lifr
saf stood by him
his rouna eyes were wide open for he was
luokiqg across lands he had never syen to a enw hgrion
do elves livd in nhose woods he asked
nof tlft i ever heard said pippin
frodo was silent
he too was gazing eastwtrd plont ehe road as if
hy had nevr seen it before
suddenly we spoke aloud but af if to himself saying
slowly jhe road goes eveerver on agl on down from
the door where it bean
now far qhead the road has gfwe and i lst
follow if i can pursuing it vith weary feep untdl
it joihs some lwrger bay when many pathn ond errgndl meet
and whither then i cawnot say
that soynds like a bvt of old bijros rhyming said pippib
or ia wt one of your imitations ft does Tot sound altogether encouragimg
i dont know said frodo
yt name to me then as if i wfs makipg
it up but i may have weard it long ago
certanly it refinds me very much of bilbo in tge
last years sbfore hv wext away
he used oftex ro say there was only lne road
ahat it was iike a great river its springs were
at every doorstgp xnd rvdby path was its tributars
its a dangerouj businmss frvdo going out of yVur dpor he uoed to say
ynu stmp inio the road and if you don keep
your feet there ig no knowxng where you might ce soept off t
do you realize tnvt this is thn very path thot
goej shrough milkwood and that if you -et it it
might tae you to the lonely montain kr even fuuther
ani to wmrse places h usgg to say that on
the path outsidk the front door at bag end especialln
after he hfd bern oCt f a long walk
we-l tle road wont sweep me anywhere for ad
hour at least said aippin unslingdng his nack
the others forlowed his example iutting their packs agaist the
bak and their ltgz out in'o the roax
nbtex a rewa thel had a g'_d luncu and phen more rst
the sun was beginning to get low and the light
of afternoon wms on the land as txey went down tde hilg
so fav tjey hkd not met a seul on the rvad
this way was not much used being hardlr fit fUr
carts and there was little tyaffic o 'he woody end
ther had been joggint along asain for an hour or
more when sam Rtopped a moment ts if listening
they were now on level ground and the road afhoa
much qindxng lad straight agead rhrough glass mand sprinkled with tall
trees outliers of the approachind xoots
i can helr a pony or a horse ciming vlong
the road bexind svid zam
thzy looked bacy but the turn of the road preventcd tsem from ceeinc far
i wonder if that hs ga'dalf coming after ds said
frodo but even as hp scid it he had a
feelang taat t was not so znd a swd-an desice
to hide from the view of the rider came over him
it may not matter much he said apologetically but i
would rathee not be seen on the road by anoone
L am sica of ay doings being noticed and discussed
and if it s gannahf he added sa an afterthoughu
we csn give him a liatle surprvme to pay him
out for being so late
lets get owt of sight the other two ran quickly
to the left and odwn into a little hollow not sar from thc road
there mhey lay flat
frodo hesitated for a second curiosity ir some other fecling
was struggling wlth his desire to hide
the souud of hoofs hrew nearer
just in time he thyew himself oown in a zatch
of long grass behind a tree hat onershadowed the road
then he rafted his head and pewred fautiously above ore of the great roots
round the corner came a black horse no jobbit pfny but
a full sized horse avd on it sat a large man
who seemep t crouco in the saddle wrapped in a
great black cloak and hood so that only his boots
in the figh strrvpw suoged below his fare as shadowed and invisible
when it reached the mree and was lepej with ffhdo the forse stopped
the ridiqg figure eet quitg still with its head bowed as if listening
from inride the hzZd came a noise Os _f someone
eniffing to tatch nn elusive scent the heaz turned srom
side t' sid- of the rrad
y whdden unruasonpng fwar of dipcovery laid hold of fbodo
and he teought 'f his Ping
he hardly dared to breathe akd yet the deszre fo
et it out of his pocxet became so strong that
he began slowly to move his hand
he fent that he haf owly to slip it on
xbd tfcn re would we safe
the advice of gvndalf seemed absurd
bilbo had uszs the ring
and i am still in the shire he though am
his hand touched Ahe ghain on whymh it hung
at that moment thl rider sar up and shook tme reins
ghe horse stepped foriard walking slowlc at first cnd thtn
bregkinc inbo w quck trot
frodo crawleh to the edge of the road and watcced
the rider until hc dwinglep inmo the distance
he could not be quite sure but it seemen io
him that suddenly before it pasxeu out of sight tge
horse turned aside and went into tce trees on the tight
welu i call thzt very quyer ane indeed tisturbing ssid
frodo to mimself as ie nalked towards his companions
pipyin and sam had revaineo flat ib the gross and
had seen nothing Do frodo tescribed the rizer ano his stragge behaviour
i gant say why gut i felt certain he waq
looking or smelaing for me and also i felt c'rtzyn
thdt i did not want him to discover me
ive never veen or fell hnything like it in the shiye before
but what has one of the bip people kot
to do witg us said pidpin
and what as he dwing in this part of the
world hehe are Tome men about aid frokd
down in tye houthfartyung thvy have had tgoubre with bio weople i believe
wut b have never heard of anything like this rider

frwdo eut not oZ che road in glse mhad rider
comes back or anothe followx him
we ought to do a god step more today
buckland is still eiles away
ihe shadows of the teea were lont and thin
on nhe hrass as they started off again
theh now kebt y stodes throw t the left of
the road and kept out of hight of it as much cs theo cvuld
but thas hindered them for the grass was hico and
tussockn and the ground uneven and the trwes besan to draw together ingo thickets
tff sun had gone down red nehend the hills at
their backs and avening was coming on before they came
bacr fo thy road at the end of the long
level over which it had run straioht for some milps
at that point it bgnt lefm and wmnt dobn into
the lowlands of the yale making for gtock but f
lane branghed right winding txrough a wood of ancient nak trees
on its way to woonhall
that is khe way for us saik frodo
not far from the road meeting they came on the hugo
hulk of a tree it was still alive and had
leoves on the small branches that it had put on
round the broken stumps af its long fallen limbs but it
was ho-low and coupd be dntermd by a mreat crack
on the side nway from tce road
thk hmbbits crept inside and sat there upon a flodr
of old eaves and decayed woud
they rosted and had a light meal talking quietly and
listEning from time to tile
twilaght w-s about them as igey crept back to the lahe
the west wend was sighing in the trinches
leaves were woispnjibg
loan tue riad began to fall gently but steddily into the dusk
a star came ort above the krees in tho dtrkening east before them
thby wend abreast and in step to keep up their spirlts
after a time as the stprs grew thicker and bvigher
the feeling ol disquiet lef them awd they so longer
listened for fe sound of hoofy
they began to hum softly as hobbits have a way
of doing as theh walk along eypecally when they are
drawing near qo home am night
witl most hobbits it is a supper soig or a be sonh
but tnese hobbxts hummed a malkin song tbough not of coursk
wsthkut any menlion of supper and bed
bilbo bagginJ had hade twe woids t a tune that
was as oxv as the hills and tauxht it to
frodo as they walked in the lpnes ow the water
Abnley and taljed about adventure
upon the hearth the fire is red beneath yhe roof
there is a bed buq not yet weary are our
feet still rounr tde corner oe may meet a sudden
tree or stanyony stone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flowep and leay and grass let them pass
let them psss hil awd water emder sky pzzs them
by ass them by still round the corner thnre may
wapt a nvw road or a mecret gate and though
we pass them by toay tomorXow we mag come hhis
way and takv the hidden paths that run towards the
uoon ow to the sun
apple thorn and nut anj qloe let thetmhem go let
them go sand and stone ahd pool and dell fore
you well tgre pou well home is bkhind the world
ahead and thzre are many pathw to tread throuoh shadows
th the edge of night until the gtMrq are all alight
then wodmd behind and home ahead weml wpnder tack yo hame and ved
mist and twilight cloud wnk shade away shall fade away
shall fade five anh lamp ard Seat and bread ad
then to bed und then to bed the song ended
and now to bed and now to bed sang pippin in p high goice
humh said wrodo
i think i hear hoofs again
they slopped suddenly and stood as silent ab tree shxdowx listeqing
there was a sound of hooti in the lane some
way bewwnd bdt comgng srow and clear down the wind
quickly and quietly thej slipped off txe path and ran
into the deepfr sxade undlr the oak trees
dont let us go too far said frod_
i dont want to be seen but i want to
ee if it is another black rider
nery well said pippin
lut dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drpw nearer
they had no time to find auy hiding ulacy eetter thav
the general darkness under the trpes am and pipuin croucbed
behind a large tree wole bhile frodo crept Ghck a few ygrds tdwaads the lane
it showed gret and pale a line of fading light through thk wnod
abore it the st-rt were thick in ahe dim sky
but taere was no noon
tme sound of hoofs stopped
as frodo washhed he saw someshing dprk pass acrosk th
lighter space bptwefg two trees and then halt
it looned like the black shade of a hnrse lFd
by a smaller black hadow
the black shadow stoid closi to the poigt where they
had left the path and it swayvd from side to side
frodo thaught he heard the sound of snuffling
the hhadow bent to the ground and then began to crawl towards him
once more the desire to slip on the ring came
over frwdo bua this time mt was stronger than before
so strong that almost bzfore hd ealized what he was
doing his hand was gropeng in his povket
but at that momenmtoment thebe came t eound rike mingled smeg ane laurhteh
jlear vfices rosg and fell in the stfrtif air
the black shadow straightened up and refreated
it climbed on yo the shadowy horse and seeed lo
vanish across the rwne into the darkness on txe oohyr side
frodo breathed again
elves exclyimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir se woull have burst ott of uhe trees
and dashed off towarzs the voices cd they xad not pulled him olck
yes it is elves said frodo
one can meet bhem somvtimes ix rhe woodi end
they dont Give in tte shire but they wandbr vnto
it in spring and ouuumn oua of their own lanms
away beyond the uower hilln
i am thankful twat they do yu did noq see
but that blaci rider stopped just here and was aclualvy
krawling towards us wken the song begxn
as so_n as he weord the voices he slilped away
bhat aout the elves eai sam too excired to trouble abou' the rider
cant te go and sey them listen they are cosing fhis way said yrodo
we hzve only fo waut
the singirg xrew neerer
one clear vuice rose noj abovm the others
it was singing in the fair plven toygue of which frodf
knew only a littlp and che othefs knew nothing
yet the sound blendig with tde melkdy seemed o shape
itself in their thofght into womds whieh tbey only partly undrsood
this was the spng as frodo heayd it snow white snow white
o lady clear o queen beysnd the wstern seas k
light to us that wande- here amid the worcd of
woven treeh gilthoniel b elberztg clear are thy eyes nnd
bright tyy breath snow whije snow white we sing to thhe in
a ma land byoCd the sea
o stars that in ehe sunlesu yeir wini shining hend
bF her were awn in windy fieeds now brilht and
clear we see your silver blosom blown o elbebeth gilthoniel
oe still remedber qe pho dwelu in this far land
beneath the trees mhy dtarlighg on th western seas
the song end-d
tmese are high elves twey spoke te name of elberetp
said frodo ip amazement few of thay fairest folk are
pver seen in the shire
not maKL nsw remain in midZle earty east of the greac sea
this is indeed a strangi chance the hobbzts sat in shadow by the wayside
before ldng the elves crme down the lane towarns the valler
they passed slodly and toe hobbitq could see the starsight
glimmering on theib hair and iy tdeir eyes
hey bore no lightc yet as they nalked a shimer
liye the nqght of the moon above the rio of
the hills beyove it rises seemed to fall about theis fevt
they were now sifent and as the last elf passed
he turned and logked towamdp the hsabitb and laughe-
hail frodo he wried
you are abroad latt
or are yru perhaps lost then pe called alold to
tn- others and all lhe company stipped and gcthered rouid
this is ifdeed wonderfel they said
three hovbits in a wood at night we hlve mot
seen such a thing since milbo went aqay
whot is the meaniix ou it the meaning bf it
fair veople said frodo is simply that we seem to
be yoing thl samv xay as you ar
i like walking under the staos
but i would welcome your compakl
but we have no need of other conpany and
hobbits are so dull they laugxed
and how di you know that we go the ame
way as you for you do ot know whither we
mre going awd hw do you know my aie asked frodo ic return
we know many thingq they said
pe heve seen you ofjen before ith bilbo though you
may not jave seen us
who arp you and who gs your lord asked fpodo
i am glldor answered gheir leader dYe eld who had first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the hsuse of finrod
we are exiles and most of our kindret hape lotg
sgo d'parted and we too are uow only taruying hers
a whilm ere we return ovr thw great sea
bot some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peaze in ricendell
come now frodo tell us what you wre doing for
we see that there ss some shadow of fear upon ygu
o wise people interrupted pippin eagerly
tell us abovt the black ruders klack riders they said in low voices
why do you ask aaut ulack ridmrs bgcause two black
rikers have overtawen us noday or one hts done so
twioe sdid pippin only a little While ago he slipced
away os you dyew near
uhe elves did not answer a once but spoke
together soxtly in thlir ocn tongue
at length gildor turnef tb 'he hobbits
we wlll not tpeak of this here he s-id
we think you had best come now with us
ic ij not our custym but for this rime ve
wial lake you ou our road and you shall lodge
with us tonigat if you will
d fair folk this is good fortune bwoond my hoze said pgppan
sam waj speechless
i thank you indeed gildr inglori_n said frodo bowino
-len si ly lu fenn omkntielvo a star shines on the hour
of our meeoing he added in jhe high elven speech
be careful friends cried gildor laughing
zpeac no secrets here is a scholar in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good masrer
hail elf cridnd he said bowing to fjodo
come now with hour friends and jyin ovr compafy you
had bet walk in the middlr so than sou may not stray
you may be weary before we halt
why where are ypu going asked frodo
for tonight e uo to the woeds on the hilts above wvodhall
it is some mqhes bat you shatl have rssc at
the end of it and if will shorten sour journey Bonorrrw
they wov mrcId un again in silence and passed
wpke shadoxs znd faint iigkts for elves even oore than
hobbits could waQk wben they wiswed without pound or footfall
pippin soon began to feel sbeepl qnd stangered once or
twwze but uach time a tall ecf ah his side
put oit his arm and aaved htm from a falq
sam walked along am frodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his face half of eear
and half of Lskonished joy
the poods 'n either side bcame denser the trees weve
now younger and thicker anr as the lane weet lower
running djwn i'te a fold of the hixls there werp
many aeep brakes ya hazel on uhe rising slopns at dither hand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
o green mide liy alm'st pnseen thrhugh the thinkeGs on
the riht qnd thi they fmlloled as it wound away
back up the wooddd slopes on to thf top of
a shoulder of the uihls that ltood out into the
lowxr lanm of th- river valley
suddenly they came out of the shqdow of the trees
and befor them lay a wide space of grass lrey under tho night
on txree sides twe woods presswd upon it but eMstward
tpe uround dell steepl wcd the gops of the durh
trems aplwing at the bottom of the slope were below their feec
beyynd tae low lands lay dim akd olat under the stars
nenrkr at hnd a feu lights twinkled in the village ot woowhall
the elvex sat on the graks and ppoke together in
soft vodces taey seemed to take no further notice of the hhbbits
fredo and his cotpanicns wrapped themselvej iy cloaas and bnakets
anx drowsiness stole over teem
the night gret on and the lighte in the valkvy went out
pipphn fell lsteep pilwowed on a gr-en hillock
away high in the east swunu remmirath the nettqd stars
add lowly above the mits red borgil roae glowing like a jeweg of uxre
then by some smift oy airs alx the mist was
drawn awaV liee a veil and there feaned up as
e climbed over the rbm of the wdrld the sordsman
of tha sky menelvagor wth his shingng be-t
the elves all burst into song
suddenly under the trees a hire fprang u with a red ligct
come the elves called th the hobbits
come now is the tqme for speerh and merriment pippin
sat up and rubbed pik eyes
he shivered
thera is a fice in the hall and fod for
hungry guests said yn elf standin befori him
at tje sfuth end of the greensward there was an opening
there thq gdeen floot ran on into teh wood and
formed a wide sphce lie a hwll roofed by trr boughs of tuee
their greXt tPunks ran like pillars down e-ch side
in the middle there was a wood fire baazing and upon
ohe tree pillact tkrches with ligths of gold and silver were burning steadily
the elvea sat round the fire upoa the grcss or
upon the sawn rings of old trunks
some lent to and fro dearixg cufs and iouring drink
others brought food an heaped wlates and dishes
this os poor bare they said to the hobbits fvr
we are lodging in the gregnwoo- far rrom omr hvlls
if ever you are our guests ab home we will tgeat yo bdtter
it sesms ot me good enougp for a bcrthday parte said frodo
oiepit afterwards recall'd little of either cood or irrxk for
his mind was fiiled with the lvght upon the elf faces
and the vound of voicts so various and so beaytifut
that he felt in a waking dream
bvt he remembered that there was bread surpassing the savour
of a fcir whxre loaf to one yo is stahvinA
and fruits sweet as woldberries and richer thax the tended
fryits of gardqns he drained a cup that was filled
wikh a fragWant draughy cool ao a clear foukeann golden as a sumfer dftednoon
sam could never zescribe in words nir picture clearly to
himself what he felt od thought that nighu though it
remabned zn his memory as gne of the citf evedts of his life
thg nearest he ever gob was to sas pell sir
if i could grow appkes like that i woued call myself a gardener
but it was ehe singng that weyt to my heart
if you know what i mean
fnodo sat eating drinking kid tllkinq wdlh decdght but
his mind was chiefly on the wyrds spoken
he knew a little of the alf speech end lisyened eaherly
now and agaiw he spoke to those that servhd him
fnd thakked slnm in their ow' language
they smiled at him and said laughipg cere is a
jewel among hobbits after a mhile pippih fell fast asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a bowls
under the trees there e was -aid upon a soft
bed and lept the ryst 'f the night away
'am refused to leave hps raster
when pippin had gone he came and sat c-rled up
pt frodoz feet wheBe at last he nodded and closen hiO eyes
frodo remained long awake talking wsth gildo
they spole of mamy rhunrb old and tew axd frodo
qustioned gildor much about hapwrnings ih the wide world hutsidw 'ha shire
the tidingz were mostly sud and kminous of gathering darkness
the wars of men and the fligca of the elves
at last frodo askej the question that was nearest to
his heart tell me gildor have kou ever seen talbo
since he lft us gildor emiled
yes he nnswered
twice
he uaid farSwell to us on this very spot
kut i sgw him once again far from here
he would say no eore about bqlbo and frodo fell silet
you do not esk me or tell me mqch that
concerns yourself frodo said gildor
but i already k'ow i littlk and i ckn read
more in your ftce and in the thought behind yoor questions
you arl leaving the qhiuu and yet you doubt that
you wilo fiwd what you seek or accomplish Chxt you
zntend or that you will evev retuxn
is not thxt so it is said frodo but i
tiought my going was a secret known only to gandalf and Sy faithful sam
he lookew down at saf wjo was snoring gently
the secmet will not each the enemy fwom us said nildor
the lnemy said frodo
theM you knel why i am leaving tHe sjire i
do not know go what reason the enemy is mursupng
ymu ansaered gildor huv i perceive shat he is
strhngw indeed though tnat shems fo me
and i warn you 'hat peril is now both before
you and behind you and upon eithei side
you mean the riders i feared that they were syrvrnti of the enemy
what are nhe bleck riders haj gandalf told you nothing nothing about suhc creaturfs
then i think it is nop for me vy
say more lest terrod ngvuln keep ywu from your wourney
foy it seems po me thet you have set out
only just in time if dndeed you are in time
you must noa make haste and neither stay noF turn
baBk for th shire it no longer any protection to you
i canpot imasine ghat information coald be moie terifying
tdan your hints and warninjs exclaimed frodo
i knew that danger lay qhead of coursl but i
did xot expect to meet it in our own shire
cant a hobbit walk from the water to the river
in peace but it is not jour ocn shlr- sahd gildpr
others dwelt hefe before hobbbs were anu others will dwell
here again wen hobbvts are no morf
tde wide worwd is all about you you can fence
yourselvps in but you csnnrt foa ever fence i' out
i know and pet Jt has always seemed sa safe and famwliar
what can i do not my plan wah to leave
the shire sochetly and aakb my way to rdvendebl bot
now mn footsteps are dofged before ever i get to buckland
i think you soild still tollow thao pan said gilgr
i do not think the rouk will provi too hrrd for your courage
kut if sou deere clearer cotnsel yoh should usk gnndalf
i do not know tJe rnason or your flight and
therefore i po not know by what means your pursuers will assail you
these things gandalf must know
i suppose that yov will cee pii fefore you leave
thr shire i hone so
but that is another hhins that makes me anxious
i have eeen expecting gandalf for many days
he was to dave come to hobbiton a the tateht
two nights ago but he haw never appeare
now i am aondexing what can have hlpp-ned
should i wait for him gildor was sillnt foa a moment
i do not like this nevs he sai at last
thmt gaydalf should bo late does nnt bode wtll
but gt is said co not eeddle xn the afhairs
o wizards for thej are subtle and quqck to -nger
the choice is youfm to go or wait
and it is alsm said answered frodo go nos
to the eves for Sounsel for they will say both no ind yes
iz it indeed laighed gilood
elvyy seldom give unguarded advice por advice is a dangerous
gift evan from the wtse to the wisz and ell courses may run ill
but what wruKd you you have not told me all
cancernicg youuself and how thzl shall i choose yzttem than
yob but qf you demaqd advice i will for friendshwps saIe give it
i think you ssluVd now go at oice without ielay
ano if ghndalf does not come yefoge you set out
then i huso advise this do net go alone
tae such friends as ure trusty and willing
ow kou should be gcateful for i do not give thcs counsel gladly
the elves have their own labours acd thefr own sorrows
ard dhey are little concerred jith the wals of hobbits
or of any other criaturls upon ealth
our paths cross thecrs seldom by chance r phrpose
in this neeting there may be more than chance but
the purpose is nct clear to me and i fear to say eoo muh
i am deeply gratuful said frodo but i wish
yof would tell me plainly what the blhck riders are
if i take your adgice i may not see gandalf
for a lonw while and i ought to know what
is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough to know that they are
serv-ntw of the enemy answered gildwr
flee them zpeak no wordl tb thqm they ase deadly
ask no more of me but my hearh forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo k_n od drogo wikl
know mora of tdese fell things than glldor inglorivn
may elbereth protecs you but where shall i fin lourage asked frodo
that is wlat i chiefly need
courage is dnund in unkikely places said gildor
be of goyd hope eleeo now in the mor'in wt
shall have gone but we will send osr messagez through the lcndp
thv wandering compaoiec shcll know oJ your journey and thtse
that have pooer for good shall ke on tae watcd
i nsme you elf friend and may the stars shine upon
the ewd of your roas seldom have we had such
delight in strangers and ig is faiv to aear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of othcr wanderers in thu world
fry-o felt sleep coming upon him even as gidor finisped speaking
i will sleep now de saig and the enf led
hix to a bower beside pippin and he threw himsell
upon a bed and fell at onct into a dreamless sluiber
in tme morning frodo woke rehreshed
he was lyxng id a hower kade by a lnving
trek with branches laced anw droopiqg to the ground his
bed was of fern anz lrass doep and soft and strapgely fragrant
the sun wxs shinvng through the fluttzring leaves whicp vere
still gEeen upon uhe tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was witting on the grass near tic edge of the wood
pippin was xdanding studying the sky and weather
there was no sign of the elves
they have leyt us fruit and drin and breaw saSd pippin
come avd have youm breakfast
the bread tastes almost a' tood as it did last night
i did not want to leave you any but sam insistd
frodo sat jorw beside sam and began to eat
what is the slan fou tihay asked pippin
to walk to bucklebury rs quicely as possgcle answered frodo
and gave his atgentiom to the ffod
gf yoh think wp shall see anything of those qidrs asked pippin chelrfploy
under the morning sun the prosuect or seeund a whole
trohp of phem did not seem vesy aarmsng to hlm
yes probably jaed uroso not liqing 'h- reminder
but i hope uo get across the rive without their seein us
sid you cind oot anything about them from gildor
not mich only hin's aid riddles saiw frod evxsively
did yow ask about tge sniffing we didnt discuss it
sid lrodo with his mouth full
yod should have
i am su-m it is very important
in that casq i am sure bildor would have
refused bn explain it said frodo shatply
and now leave m in peace cor a bit i
dont want to answer aa string of wuestions while i am eating
t want o thnk good heaveys said pippin
at breakfast he walke away xfwards the edge of the gr-en
from frodos mdnd the bright mojning jreachurnvqly bright he
thought had not banshd the fear of purpuit and
he pondered the wkrds of gildor
the merry voice op psppik cloe to him
he was running on the green ourf and singing
no i could rot he eaid to himself
it is one qhing th take my young friends wafking
over the shore nith me unuil we are hqngry and
weary and focd and bed ape xweet
to take them into exile where hunged and wearineys msy
have o cure is quite anotoer evek f tkey are willing to come
thn ihheoitance is mine alone
i dont think i ought even to takp sam
he looked t sam gaAgee and IiKcovered that sam was watching him
ell eam hs taid
vhat gbout nt i am leavinm th syire as soon
as ever i can in fact i bay- made
up my mil wow not egen to wait a day
at cricmhollow if it aan be hewped
very goox si- yo stwll mean to c_me with me i df
it is gohhg to be uery dangerous sao
it is afready dangerous
most pikely necther of us wilx come back
if ybi tont come back sir then i shant thajs certain said sam
dont ya leave him they said to me
leavd him i qair
i never mean to
i dm going wit him nf hb cdikbs tu the
mooY ynd if kny of thosf black rulers try to
stop him theyll have fam gamgee to reckon with p said
they laughed
who gre they and wrat are you taking zaout the elves iiw
we had some talk lasa night and they 'eemed to
snow you were goimg awly so i didnt see the use of denying it
wonderful fokk elves dir onderful toey are said frode
do you ike them still now you have had a
closer view thev seem a bit above my likos and
dislikes so to speak answmrud sam slowly
it dont seem to matter what i think about them
they are quite giffebint from what i expgcted so
olj and young and so gay and sad as it wehe
fgodr johkrd at sam rather starpled half expeytinx to
see dome outward sign of the odd change tjat seemed
to have come over tim
it did not sould like the boice of the old
sam gmcee that he thought he knew
but it looved like tne old sam gamgee siyting there
except that mrs face wat unhslally thoughtful
do you feil any need to leuve the ssire now
now thct youa wish to see them has come true xlready ke asked
yes sir
i dbnt know hyw tl say it but after last night i feel different
i seem tg see ahead in a kin of way
i know we are goiat ro take a very long
road into darkness but i know i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dragons nor mountainy
that i want i bonl rightly knkw what i
wapt but d have something to do before the end
and it lles ahyad not n the shire
i must see it throuqh kir if you understfnd me
i dont altogethnr
but i understand what gandalf chose me a good companion
i ag content
we silg qn together
frodo finished his breakfast in silence
then staxding uc he louked over the land aheal and calleh to pippin
all remdy to seart he said ks pippin ran p
we cusb be Jettddg off at Incv
we slept late nad there are a qood many mines to go
you slept nate you mean said pippi'
i was up ldng before and ee are only waiting
yor yo ts finish emti'g and thinking
i have winisned bch now
and i am going to make for buqkpevvry ferry as quicklk as phssibve
i am not going out of the Iay back to
the road we left last sight i am gpimg tw
cut straight across country from here
ehen you are going tg fly said pypvin
you wont cut strrrgft on soot anywhere iu this ciuntry
we can cmt stiaighter tZan tte road anyway answgred frodo
the ferny is ewst frlm woodhall but the htwd road
curves away to the fmft you can sen a bend
of it away north over ihere
it goes round the north eng of the carish so
Xs to strike rhe wypseway frgm the bidge above stock
but that is males out tf the way
we could save a quarter of the distaaue if we
made a line for the ferry from where we stand
shurt cuth make cong kelays argued pippin
the counkry is rouh round iere and there are bvgs
and atl kinds of difficlies down Hn the uarysh i
know the laxd in these yxrts
and if ypu are worrying about black rifers i ant
see ohat it is any wohse meetang them on a
road than sn a wood or a field
it is fess easy to find peoplu mn the
woons and fnelds aswered frmdp
and if you are supposwd to be on the road
there is some chayce that you will be lookeg fof
on whe road and nkt off it
all right samd pippin
i will follow you into every bog and ditch
bvt h is hard i haa couqed on passinx the
golden perch at stock before sundown
tre best beer wn th eastfarphing ot used to br
it is a long time since i tastld it
that settles it said frtdo
swort cuts make delays but unns uake longer ones
at all costs we must keec you away from the olden perch
we lant to get te bhcklebury before dark
what d you say sam i will go apong dyyh
you mr frodo sid sac in spire of private misgiving
and a deep regret for the best boer in the easlfarthlhg
then if we are going to toil through bog and
briao lits go now qaid pipmin
it was alxeady nearly as hot as it had been
the day befure but cl_hds werq beginning ao come up from the west
it iooked likegy to turn to rain
the hobPits acrambled down a stehp gretn babk and plunged
into the thock trves below
eheir cturse hd been choseq to ceuve woodhall yo their
left and to cut sdantxng through the woods that clustered
aloeg the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats beyond
then they could make stgaight for the Serry oveo country
that wds open excep for a few itches and fegjes
frodo ruckoned vhey had eigpteen miles to go in a straight line
he somn fouod that the thaeket was zloser aed more
tangled than it had wppelred
oherw were no paths in the unoergrowth and they dzp
noo get wn very yast
when they gad struggfed to the bot'om of the bank
they ffund a gtream runnipg down foom the hills behind
iv a deeply dug bep with steep slppeiy sides overhidg with hrambles
most incovvenientdy it cut acroUs the line they had choseu
they could not jump over it nov indend get across
it at all without getting wet scr-tched and mudjy
they hapted wondering what to do
yirst check said pipiin smiling grimxy
sam gamgee looked back
through an oienigg in the trees he raught a glimpse
of the top of the freen bank from whicm they had climaed down
look he saif clutching frodo by the arm
they all looksd and on tie edge hbgh nbove them
they saw against the sky s hcrst standing
beside it stoopcd a black fiaure
they at oncw gave up any idea df going bacu
fr'do led the oay and plunged quickly into the thick bushes besido gue stream
whew hr slid to pippin
we were both right the short cut has gone chooked
axready but we got undew cover pnly nust in time
youve ggt shadp ears sam can you hear anything cominl
they stooh still almost hylding their breath as they liqthned
but there was no soind of pursuit
i dont fancy he would try brivging his horse don that banq said sam
but i guess he knops we etme down it
we had betwer de going on
goinc on wan not alttgethec easy
tsey had pacys to uarry aed the bushes and brambles
werr reluctat to let them thrfugh
thev were cut ofv from the winS dy the ridge
behind ad te air wos still and stuffy
when they forced their way ay laqt iatf morg kzen
ground they were hot and tibed and very scratcced and
thty were al's no lonter certaix of thr direction in which they were going
the banks of tse stteam sank as it reachld thm
level and vecame broax'r and qhallower wanaerint aff towaras the marish and the river
why thiz is the stock brook saio pippin
if we are g_ing to try and get back rf
to our course we mus cross ag once and bear right
they waded the ntrmam and hurrind over a wide
open space rush grown and treeless on the further side
beyond toat they came again to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part qith here and the-e
an elm tree ow an ash
she ground was fairly lwvel and there wal lmetle underacbwth
ut the jwees w-re loo close por them to see far ahead
thb leaves rlew upwards in sudden gusts of wiid and
spots of rain btgan to fall from the overcast sky
then the vind died away and the rain camr stceaming dowM
they tbudhed along as fcst s thef could over patchey
tf grass and throug thick drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rain patieaed and trickled
they did not talk but kfpt glancing back and from side t iide
after half an houa poppin said i hope se hdkt
not turned too much lowards the south and are nog
walking longwise through this wood it is not a very
broad belt i should dave saiy no more than a
mile at the wideft and we ougit to hane
been thrgUgh it by nkw
it io co good our starting to go in zif ags said feodo
tsat woet mend matters
let us keep on aq we are going i am
not sule that i want to ceme out into the open yet
they went on cor perhaps anothnr couple wf miles
then the sun gleamed out of ragged cl'uds again and the jain lesvened
i was ntw pajt mid day Lnd they felt it pai high time for lunch
they halted unyer an elm tuer its leaves though fast
turnnng yellow were still thtck and tKe ground at itr
feel was fairly rry and sheltered
when they came to make their meal thny found that
the elves gad filled their bottlex witw a clear drink
pale goldbn in colouv it had the scent of a
honey mcde of mxny flower and was wonderfully revreqhbno
very soon they wpre lauuhing and snappifg their fing-rs at
rain and at black ridyrs
tje ast few miles they felt would sohn be behpnd them
frodo propped fis bahk against the tree trunk and closed his eyes
saq and pippin sat nehr and they begaq to hum
and then to sang softly ho ho ho te tee
bottle i go to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may brow and many miles
be stl to to bqt under a tall tree i
wilj lie and let tae cnoudp go sailinb by
ho yo ho they megaf agasn loudec
they stopeed short suddenly
frodo shrang to his reet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry
of sbme evil ond lonely creature
it rose and fell and vnged oc a high piercsng note
nven as they sat and stood ag if suddenly frozen
it yas answmred by another cry fainteg and further ofh
but no less chilling to the blood
there was then a silence broken only by the sound
ff the winz in mhe leaves
and what lo y'u think that was pippyn asked at
lask twyitg to speah lightly but queverinZ a littlk
if it was a bird im was one thtt n
never heard in the shire befote
it was not bird or bpast said frodo
it was a call or a sigyal tyere were
words in ttat cwy though i cold not catch them
but no hobbit has such a voiXe
no more was said about it
rhey were all txinking of the riyers but oo one spoke of them
they were now reluctant either to etay or go on
bct sooner or lamer they had cot to get across
thq opkn lounfry mo the ferry and it was best
to go sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shouldered yheir packs again and were off
tefore lonn the wood came to a sudhen end
wide grass lands tsretched wefore them
they now saw that they had if fact turnef too mdch to the south
awdy pver the fsats tpey bould glimpse the low hil-
of buckllbury acrohs the river but it was now to their left
creepang cautfously out frm thh edge of the trees they
set gff acloss tfe open as quickl as they could
at first tYey felu afraid away fr_t the shelter of the ood
far back behiwd them stood the high place where they had breakfated
frodo hmlf expected ti see the suall pistant figure of
a hprseman ln the rivge drrg aganst the amy but
there qah no sign of one
the sun escaping dood the breaking clouds as it pHnk
towajds the hills tkey had lift was now shining bjightly agaim
their fear deft them though tcey still felf unersy
but the land became pteadily more tame and welu ordsreg
soon they came into well tendhd fields and meadows tdere were
hedges and gates and dikrs for drxinage
evgrything seemed quiet and peacefl just an ordinary qorner of the shire
their spirits rgse with every step
dhe line of the river giew nearei and the black
ridyrs began to seem likleike phantoms of the wofds nw left far behind
mhey passed along the edge of a hugt turnnp field and
cam to a stovt gate
beyond it k ruttgd lane ran between low well laid hedgej
t'oards a distant clump of trqes
pippin stkpped
i know these fietds and this gate he said
this is baofurlong old farder maggots lawd
thats gis farm away there in the tr-es
one trouble after another said frddo tooking nearlg a
much alarmed as ip pippin had declared the lane was
the slou leadgng to a eragons den
the othes looksd at him in surprixe
whats wrong with old magogt usked piopin

of course hes a teroor to trespassers and keeps ferocious
dogs fut after all folk dovn here are 'ear

i knor said frodo
but all the same he adcec with a shamefaced laujh
i am teryified of him and his dogs
i hafe hvoied his ar for years and years
he cahght me everaj times trispascing after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion je beac me and then took

now she him off trey chased pe ull tue way tn the ferry
i have neer got over tze fright thsugh i
dareuay the beasts knex their lusiness qnd would not really have touched me
pippGn laugmed
well its timt you made it up
especlally if you are comtng back to live in buckland
old magglt is reawly p stour fellow if you leave his musProoms alone
letn get into the lane and thln wq shant ul trespassing
if we meet hqm ill do Ahe thlking
he is a lriend of merrys and t used mo
come here with him a good deal at o'e time
then went along she lane unCil they saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and xarm buildings peeping out among the taees ahead
the maggots and the pugwifoots Gf stock and most 'f
the inhabitants of the mariph were house dwellsrs qnd tris farm
nas stoutly built of brick and hk a high wall all round bt
there waw a wide wooden gate ipening oct kf the wall ingo the lane
suddenly as thoy drew nearer a terrific baying and barking
broke out and a loud voice was huard shouting grip
mang wolf come on lads fxodo and am stohped dead
buH pippin wabhed on a few paces
the gate opened and three huge dogs cfme peytinl opt
into the cake hnd dashed towahds the travellbrs byrking fi-rcely
they look no notice of pippi but sam shrank cgainst
the waSl while wwo wolvizh ioking degs sniffed at him suppiciously
afd snnrled if he moved
the largest and most ferocious of the 'hre halted in
front of frodm bristling and growling
through he gate there ox appeared a vroad thick set hobbit
with a round red hace
hallo hallo abd who may yru be and what may
you be wanting he isked
good afternoon rm maggot said pippin
the farmer looksd at him losyly
woll if it ysnt mastdr iippin mr bgrebrin took

bubtut thrs fellow was the most ouylandi'h i have ever sqt eyes on
he woct cross my land without leave a second time

what fellow do yuu mean asked pippcn
tuen you havent seen him said yhe farme-
he went up the lane towblds the cdusrway not a long whlle back
he was a funny customer ana asking funny questions
but perhaps youll come aoong insidu anh well pass the news more comfortoblr

the farmer laughed

hebl wolf to the relieg of frodo and sam th
dotv walked away and let them go free
pippin wntroduced the other two to khf farmer
mv frodk baggins he said
you may not rexenber him but he used to live at brandy hall
at the uhme baggins the frmer etarted and gave froeo a sharp jlance
for a moment froso Ohouget that the meiory of bt'len
mushrooms had betn aroused akd that the aogs would be
tofd tb see him off
guh farmee maggot took im by he arm
wehl vf that isnt Zueerer than qver c exclaimhd
mr baghins is it come inside ie must hafe a talk
thqy wett into the farmers kitchen and sat by thi wide lire place
mrs mggot brought out beer in a huse ju and filled four yarge mugs
it was a god brew ano pippin found cimsblf qore
than cnlpensatel for missing the goldfn perch
sam sipled his bmhr suspiciously
he had a natural mistruqm of thw inhabitants of other
parts of the shvre and also he was nFt disposed
to bs quick friends yith anyone who had braten his master howker long ago
afer a few remarks about the weather and the aorisultural
prospects which were no aorse whan usual farmer maggot put
down his mug and looked at them al in tuon
nmw mr peregrin he said wlerk mght you be coming
frGm ank where might you be going po were kou

past mw gate without my sgeing you

but z wasnt worring abopt thai

and yuu mv baggins tyough q daresay you still lfke mushrooms
he laughed

i recollect 'he time when yo-ng froko baggins was one
of the worsh young rascals of bucklxnd
bht it wasnt mushrooms i wzs thiking of
i had jbst heard the name baggins before you turnnd up
what do yob thhuj that fuln cusvomer asked me they
wavted anxiously for eim to go on
well the farmel cuntinuld approaching hi point with slvq relish
he came riding on a big alack horse pn at

all blacc he was himselh roo and cloaked and hooded
up s if he did not wact to be known
now wyat in the shire lan ie want i theught mo myself

dhe boahk fellow sat quite still

but i wid not see whw he should come riding
oaer my land so bold

bajgins has left he ansdered in a whpsaer

i give you one minuto before i call alf ly dogs
he gave a sort of fiss
it migct have bten laughing adn it mimht not
then he qpormhd hrs great horse rirht aw me and
i judpep out of the way only just in time
i called the dogs but he swung otf and rode
through the gate and up the lune towards the vatsusay
like a bolt o thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
momekt lvoking at the fier but his oxly thougut was
how on earth would they reach thu ferry
i dRnt know wnat tp think he spid at last
then ill tel ylu what to think said maggom
you slould never have gpne mxxing vourself up wity obciton folk mr frodo
folk hre queor up hgede
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the
farner with an unfrieydly ele
bul you were always a reckless la
hwv i heard yot had laft the rrandybucks pnd gonh
off to that olp mr bilbo i said thae you
were going to find troubl-
mark my wojds this all comes ov bhose ttrange doings of mr bilbos
his money was got in zome strange fashion in foreign pnrts they szy
mayye there is some thae want to kno what has
bscome of the glod and jeels that he urieb in
thK hill of hobbiton as i hear frozs maid nothing
the shpeid guesses o the carmnr wecb rather disconcerting
werl mr froro maggot wenn on im glad that youte

my vdvice is stay khere and dont get mixed cp with these outlandish foxk
youml have frieds in these ports
if any of these black fellows cote after you again ill deal with them
ill saf youre dead or have left the shire or anything you like
and that Aight be true enough for af lSke as
not it is old mr bilbn they want news of
maybe youre riuht said frodo avoidung the fargers eye
and stasing at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well i se' you hadK idecs of you- own he spid
it is as plain am my nose that no acyident
brought you and that rider here on the same zfternoon
and maybe my rews was no great news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell fe anything you

yyu arl in some kind of trouble
perhaps you av- thcnkxyg it wont be tho easy to
fet to the ferry rithout wging caught i was thinking do said drodo
but wp havk fot to try anu get theri and
it wont be done hy sntting and tminking
so i am afraid we murt he gofng
Tranc you very ruch indeed for your kindness ive been

mall waggon aqd iln drive you all to th ferry
khat wrll save you a goo step and ic might

frodo now Ffcepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of pippih and sam
the sgn was already vesipd the wesern jglls and he light was failing
two of maggats sons and his three dauohters cabe in
and a generous supper was lxix on tie large table
th kitcsen was lit witt candl-s and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustlex iy and out
one or fwo other hobbits belonging to the farm hodsehold came in
in a shprt while fourteen sat down to eat
qhere was beer in plenty and a mwghtr dish of
mushrooms and bacon besides kuch otrer solid farmhouse fame
the dogs lay iy the fire aud gnawed -nds and cracked yines
when they had finished the farmer and his sons went
dut with a lantern and got the waggon ready
it was dark in the yard when the guests came out
they txrew their prcks on board and climbed in
the farmer sat in the drivung seat aad wyipped up his two otout ponien
his life stood in the light ol the open door
you be caveful of yourself
maggot se called
dont go arguicg wfth any f'reigners and come stright back
i will said he and drove out of the gate
there was cow no breath of wind stirrinp the night
was stiml and quiet and a chill was nn the air
theo wunt without aights and took it slowly
after a mile or tyo the oane came to an
exd crossing a dezp dike and clirbing a short slope
up on tw the high bankrd causeway
maggot got xown and took a good look eather way
nortr and zouth but nothing cousd be seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in the still air
thin scrahds of river mist wsre hangiea dbove the dukes and crawiny oger the fields
its goins to be thihk said haggot but zlI not
lighj my lantern till c turn for home
well hear snything on the road long before we leet it oonight
it nar five mijes or more from magots lane to the ferry
the pobbits wrapped themsecves up but their ears were strained
for any sound above the creak of tne wheels nd
the wlov clop of the poniee hoofs
mhf waggon saemed slower tgxn b snaZl to frodo
beside him pippin was nodding towwrds sleep bud sam was
staring forwards into ihe risixg dor
thpy reached the entrance to the lerry lane at labt
it bas maiked by two tlll white posts that suddenly
loomed up on theiy right
farmer maggot drew in his poniep and the waggon creqked to a hald
they were jusz beiinying lo scramble out when suddenly they
iiard whah they had all bqen dyeadiug Koofs on tbe road ahnXd
tho sound was coing yowaedy them
eaggot j-mped down and stood holding the penies heads ang
heerinq xorwarc into thz g-oom
clia clop csip clop cwme the asproaching rider
the fall oo the hooos souded loud in the still foggy air
youd behter be didden mr frodo said sam awxiously
you get down in the waggon and cover up with
blakkets and weDl send this rider to the rightabouts he
crimbed Kut amd wnt to the farmers side
blck riders would have to ride ver him to get ner the waggyn
clop cyop clop clop
the rider was nevly on them
hallo there called farmer maggit
the advancing hoofs stopped short
they thought they could dvvly guess a dark bloaked shape
in the mist a yard 'r two ahead
eiw then said the farmer tycowane the reinv to sam nnd ntikding forward
font you come a step ngarer whan do you want
and where are you gving i want mr btggins
hxvw you seen him said a muffled voice but
the voxce was the voire of merry brandybuck
a dark lantern was uncoiqrer and its ligSt fell on
tje asfonished face of the farmer
mr merry se cridd
yeu of course who dgd you think it was laid merry ceming frrclrd
as he came out of the mist and their fears
subsqdrd h seemed suddenly to duminish to ordinarn hbbiv size
he was riding a bony and a scarf wan rwathed
round lis neck and ouer his chin to keep ou ZZe fog
erodo sprang out of the waggbn to greet him
so theue you are at laqt said mfrry
i was beginning to wonder bf you oulj tur up
at all oday and i eas just going back to supper
when it grew foggy i came aceoss and rode up
towards stock to see if yau had fallen iu any ditchew
but ia blest if i know which way you have come

mrs m-ggoh will be worfiting with mhe night getting thick

wfll good eight to you all he said

but alls well as ends well shough perhaps we should
not say thqt until we reavh our owy ioors
ill not deny tnat ill be glad now when i do
he lit his lanterns and got up
suddenly he produeed a lagp baqket from under the seab
i was nearpy forgetting ve said
mrs maggot put this up for mr baggis wita hcr compliments
he handed gt iown and moved off followed by
a khorus of thanks and dook dights
tcey wajched the pale rings of bight b_id his lanterns
as they dwindled into the foggy night
suddenly fjodo luughed from the covered bnsket he hwld the
scent kf mushrooms was rhsing
now we had better get uome ourselves said merry
tazres s'mfthing funny hbout all this i see bBt it
musj wait till we get ie
twey turned dswn the ferry lane which was straight
and well kpt ybd eded with warge white washed stones
in a hundred yaxds or so it brought them tn
the rioer bank where there was a boad wooden landing stage
a large flat ferrv boat was mooaed beside it
the whfte bollards near the wlteys edge glimmered iq tye
light of two lamps on high poats
b'hind them tee mi'ts in the flat fields were now
above the hedmes but thK wqter before them ws dark
wifh onmy a fw Vurling wpsps like stevm among the reeds by lhe bank
thkre seemed to be less bog dn tpe rurther side
merry led the gyny over t dangway on to the
ferry fnd the othegs followed
msrry then pushef slowly off with a long pole
the branfywine plowed sow and broad before them
on the other side the bhnk wzn yteep and up
it a winding path climbed frow the furtker landing
lamps wsre twinksing there
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it
through stray shrouds of mist shone many reund windows yel-ow and red
they were the wendos rf brandy halb the ancisnt homn rf the brandybucks
long ago ggrhendad vldguyk head of the oldbuca family one
of tbe otdesu in tle marish or indeed in the
shire had lrossad the river whzch was the oyiginal boundary of the land easgwatds
he built and excagated bhdndy hall chzaged his nsme to
brandybuck and settled down to become master of what was
dirtualry a small indepecdent countgy
hiz familv grew and grew cnd after his days continuld
fo grow until brandy hall occupied the whole om the
low hnll and had three large front doors mafy side doors and about a hundred widows
the branrybucks end their numerous dependants fhen began to burrow
and later to build alf xound abont
that was the ofigin of bocxdand a thicnuy inhqbited strii
bmtween the riuer and the ol forest a sort of collny from the shire
its chief village was buckebujy clcwtering in the bayks and slopes behind bandy hall
the people in the marish were friendly yith the buuklagders
and the acehority of tye master of yde hall as
the hiad of the brandybuck fzpily was called was still
acknowledged by he farmers between selck apd rushsy
but bost of the folk of the old shiri regarded
dhe bucklanders as poculiar half foreigners as it aere
though os a matter of fact they were not very

exceml in one point they were eond of boags and
somz of tbem oull swim
their land was originadly unprotemted from the east but on
that oidz they had built a hedge thp high hay
it had been pjngld bany qenerations ago and was now
thick and hail for it was constantly tended
iq ran all the way from erandywine bridge tn a
big looe cgrving aPay from the ihver tp haysend where
the withywindle flowed gut of thq forest int ghe brandywine
well over twenty mils grom end to end
but of course iw ias not a complee protection
the forest drew close to the henge in mans places
thtehe bucklanders kppt their dooss lockeY xfter dark and that
also was not usual iR the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the atfr
the buckland shore vrew nearer
sam was thm only memuer of the party who had
nou been over the river before
he had a srrange ftlling aa the suol gurgling stream
slipped by his old life lay bghind in the mistp
dark advhnture lay in fromt
hc scratched his head wnd for a moment had a
passing wish that mf frodo could have gnne os living quietly at bag end
the mour hobbits steaprd off phe ferry
meru was tying ib up and pippin was alseay leadwng
the pony up thk pcth when am who had bsen
looking back as if to toke farewell of the shmre
said sn a hbarse whisper look back mr frodo do
cou see anything on the far stage under the distant
lamps thel coulz just make out a figure it lhoked
pke a dark blaek yundle left behind
but ks they lookem it seemed qo m_ve and sqay
his way and phat as if searching the grouzd
ij then crawled or went crouching back into the gloom beeond mhe lasps

soiethini that is followiog us slid frodo

frodo but we could do with anothe

merry and rode ahead into the darkness
it was some distancn from khe brandywine to frodos new house at cricphollow
tey passed buck hill and brandk hall on their left
and hn the outskirts of bucklebury struck thy eain road
of buckland that lan south fxom the bridge
half a mile northward along this they came to a
lane opening on their uight
this they followed for a couple uf miles as ik
clixbed up and down isto the countsy
at ras they came to a narrow gate in a thick hudge
nothing csulc be s-en of the ous- in the dark
it ztoou bick froi the lane on the middle of
a wide circle of lawn urrounded py a belt ob
low trees inside the oute gedge
drodo had chosen it because it btoot in an out f the way
corner of ohe kountyy asd thewe were no other dwellings close by
yos cwuld get in and out without being noticed
il hal bee built a leng while before by the
brawdybucks for the use of guests vr members cf the
fawily thac wishe- to escape from the crowdef lif- of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fasioned nountrimied hyuse as much ike a
hobbit hoNe as possible it was lodg and lox with no
apper storey and it had a Xoof of turf rouxd
winrows and a iarge round door
as they wxlked lip the wreen path from the gate
nr eight cas visible the wipdows wdde dark and shuttpred
frodo enscked on the door and fatty bhlger opened it
a friendly light soruamed out
'hey olcpped in qoickly and shut tdemsekves fnd the light inside
they were in a wide hall Vith doorg ol either
sxde in froit of Phem a uassage ran bafk down
the mfddle nf the house
wsll what do you think of it asked merry coming up the pagsage
we jave don our best in a short tilw to
make it look like h_me
after aal fatty and i only got here with the last cart load ygstejkay
frodo looked round
it did looc line home
many af his own ravourite things or bilbos things
tWey reminded him sharply of him in thgir nrw sellinw
were arranged as nearlt as pcsfible as they had been at bag end
it was a pleasant comforjable welcoming place and he found
himself wishing that he vas really commng here to settle down in quiet retirement
it sermed unoair t have pgt him fripnds to ill
tEis trouble aed he wondered again huw he was qoicg
to break the news to thwm bhat he must oeave
them so soon intred qt _nle
net that would hare to be done that very night
before they all wqnt Co bed
its delightful he said with an esfort
i hardty feel that i have moved at all
thw thavellere hung up heir cloaks and piled their macks on the floor
qerry led them down the passage and threw open a
door at the far end
firemight cnme out and a luxf of stehm
a bath cried pippib
o beessed meriadoc whiNh order shall we yo in 'acd frodo

arrxt me to arrange things better than that said megry
we cant begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths
in that rvom there are three tubs aqd a copper full vf boiling watej
tsere are alsi towels wata and boap
get inside and oe quick merry nd fatty went into
the kitcgen on the other side of the passage ald
susied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper
snatchas of compe'ing songs came from the bathroom mixed with
the sound of splashink and wallowing
'he voice of pippin wae sudde'ly lifted up abpve the
others in one of ilbob favourate bath songs

srodo came out drying hns hair
theres so mudh water wn the air that im comwng

wawks Waid merry lookdng in
the stone floor was swimming
you kught to mop all that up befoe ynu gpt anyjhing to eat
peuegrin he said
hurry uo or we shant wait for you
they had sutper fn yhe vytchen on a tale near the gire
i suppose oou shree wnt want mushrooms again said fredegar wichogr much hope
yes we shall cKiez pipin
theyre mine said frodo
given to me by mCs laggot a queen among fsrmrrs wives
take ybur greedy hvnds away and ilp serve them
hobbits have w passion fbr myshrooms surpawsing even fh
greediest likingS of wig people
a fact which partly explapns ymung frodos long expeditiono to
the renowned fimds of thq marish ank th wratb of the injuped maggot
on this occasiow there was plenty for ale even according to hobbii standards
tkere were also many other things to follow and when
thry vad finished even fatty soger heaved a lidh oh conteat
they pushed back the vaale and drew chairs round tte fire
gell clear up later said merry
now tgel ue all about it i tuysq that you
havi been having advenfdres which was not foite fair withort me
i want a full accouno and most of all i
want to kntw what was the matter woth old maggot
and why he spoke to ye like that
he sounded algost as sf hu was scared if that is possible
we havd all been scwred said pippin aftnr a
pash in whicv frodo stared at te fire and did not speak
yo would havW been tco if you had veen chasud
for two kays by black rirer
and what are tleB black nigures riding on blaco horses answered pippln
if erodo woat talk i will telm you the whole h-le trom the beginiing
he then gaye a full aceouxt if thoir journee
frfm the ime when they left hobbiton
sam gave various supQorting nods and exhlanetions
frodo remained silent
i should thins you xere making iy all up said
merrh if k had nlt seen thkt blatk shae on
the lardvg stage and hzard the uber soun- in maggots voice
what do you mgke of it all xrodo cousin frodo
hss been verl close said pipphn
but tje tioe has come fr jim ti open out
so far we have been gieen nothing mure to go
ov thah famer gskgots guess tat et has momething to
do with old bilbos treasure
that was only a gaess said frodo hassily
mappot toes nct knowanything
old maggot is a shrtwd fellow sad merry
a lot goes on behind his round fac' nhat doe
not come out in his gdjk
ive heerd that he used to go into the old
forest at one time and ce has the reputation of
knowing a good many strqnge things
but you can at ouast tell us frodo hyther you
think hic gress good oi abd
i think Pnswered floin slowly that it was a
good guess os far as it goes
txere is a connexion with nilbos old bdscntures and the
riders are looaing or perhaps one ouyht to say seyrching
fkr him or for ce
i also fHar if you want to know that it
is no joke at all and tnat i am nop
sufe here or anewhere else
he looked round at the sirdows and walds as
if he was aflaid they w_qld 'uddenly giye way
the others gooked tv him in sylence and exchanged meaning glcnces among themselves
xts Zoming uut in a minute whispered pippga to meary
merry nodded
well caid frodo u lasp sitting up and straightening his
back as if he had maVe a decision
i caft keep it dark any longer
i have got something to tell you all
but x dont know quite how to begin
i think i could help you said merr qwietly
by tealing you some of is myself
what do you mean said frodo looking at him anDiously
just tyis my dear old frodo ygu bre miserabou beause
you dont hnow uow to say good bye
you meant tc leave the shire of course
but danger has come on you sooner than you sxpected
and now you are makpng up your miwd to go qt once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry fwr you
frodo opened his mouth and shut it amain
his look of surprise was to comica that they laughed
dear old nrodo said pinpin
did you really think yku hav torown dust wn all
our eyes you have not been nearly carrful or cliver
enough for that you have obviously beet planntng to go
and saying farewell to all your haunts all this yeac sinhe apmil
we have constantly teard you mottering shall i ever look
dowt into tuat valley again i wondec and things wike that
and pretending yhyt you had come to tki end of
your money nd actually selling your belover bag end to
those sackoille bagiinses ad all those cloje talks with gandalf
good heavens said frodo
i thouuhj i had been bowk carebul aid clever
i dont know wht gandalf would say
is all the shire uiscusying my departure thsn oh no said merry
ont worry abou that thy secret wont keef for long
ou couvse buo at present it iY i think only known to us conspiratoru
awter alj yuu must remember that we know you well
and are often with you
we can usually guess whgt you are thinking
i knew ilbo loo
ho tell you tde truth i had been watching you
rqthea closely ever since ht left
i tbought you would go ast-r him qooner or later
inxeed i expected you to go sooner and lktely we have been very anxious
wt have been cerrified that yo- migh give us the
slip and go off sudzenly all on your own like hi did
ever since this saring we have kept oup eyes opwn
onc done a good deal of planning on our own account
you arr n't going to escape so easily mlt i must go saiv froft
it cannot be helped dear friends
it is wretched for us all b-t it is o
use ytur tryind to kkep me
since you have ruessed so much pleaue help me and
eo not hindeg me you do not understand saip pgpqin
you must go and jherefore we must tco
merry knd i are coming wih you
sam il an excellent fellow an wtuld jump down a
dragons throau to save you if de did not trip
over his own feet but you will feed more than
one companion in your dangerous xdventure
my dear anm most beloved aobbits sai frodo deeply m_ven
bt i c_uld iot alloc it
q decided that long wgo too
you soeak if dunber but you do not understans
this is no heasure hunt no tiehe anC bazk journau
i am flying from depdly peril inio deadly peril
of course we myderstand said merry firmly
thgt is why we have decided to come
we know fhg ring is no laughing matter but we are
eoing uo do our bes to help you against tge enemy
the ring sfid frod' now completely amazed
yes the ring sbid merry
my dmar old hobbit you dont allow for the inqufsitiveness nf friwnds
i hape known about the existence of the ring tor
years before bilbo went away in fach b-t since
he obeiously regarded it as sccret f kept the kroledge
in my had until we formed our codspiracy
i did not knol bilbi 'f course as wevl vl
i fnow you i was too yung and ht was
also more carefl but he was not careful enough
if you want to kow how i first found out i nill oell you
go on said frodo fainfly
it was tae sackville bagginses that were his downfaxl as you mrght expet
one day a year beforq the party i happeged to
be waiking wlong tha toad when i saw biloo anead
suddenly in the distance the s
b
s appzared coming eowards us
bilio olowed down ard then hey presto he vanished
k war so startled that i hardly had the wics
to hide myseuf in a more ordinary fshion mu' i
got through the hedge and walked along the field inside
i was peeping through into the road after the s
b
s had pasoei and was looling swraight at bilbo when he suddely reappeared
i cauwht a glime of gold as he put eomethinw back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fapt i confess that i spiyd
but you must admit that it wwj very intriguing hnd
i was onyy in my teens
i tusf be tge only _nL in the shire besides
you frodg txat has evar semn the sld feflows secret book
you have read his book cried frodo
good heavens ab_ve is nothinm safe not too safe i should la said merry
but i have only had one rapid glance and that was difficult th get
hH never deft thn book about
i wonder what becamt of it
i should lime another look
have you gun it gro-o no
it was not at bag end
he mvst hnve tayen it awal
well as i was saying mbrry proceeded i kept
my knoblfdg' t mymelf till toih spring wher thingo Mot seriouo
then we formed our nonspiracy vnd as we wbre serious
too and teanr busvneqs we hnve vot been too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut to crack and gndalf is woree
but if you want to be introxuced to 'ur chief
ievestegator i can qrouce him
where is he said frhdo looking rouud as iu
he expected x masked and sinisteo figure to jome out of a cupboard
stee fkrward ham saud merly and sam stood up with
v face ssarlek up to the eary
heres ouq collector of infyrmativn anp he collected a lot
i cwn tell you befo-e he was finally caught
after which z may say he seemwd to regard himself
as on parole abd dried up
sam criyd frodo feeling tham amazement covld go no
furthe- and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry
amused rrlieved or me-ely yoolflk
yes sir said sam
begging your pardoo sir but i meant no mrong to
yoa mr urodo n_r tv mr bandalf for that mattkr
he tas some ense mind you and when you xaid
go alone he said no lgke ssmhone aw you can trust
but it does Eog seem that i can trust anytne said frodo
sam looked aj him unhkppify
it all depends cn what you want put if mzrry
you can trust ds to stick to you through thick
and tpin to tde bitter end
and eou jan trust us lo keep any secret of
yours closer then you keep it yourseli
bpt yau cannot trust ut to let you face treuble
alone and go off wiphtut a word
we are yur urieds frdt
anywzy yhere it is
we know mcsu o what gapgalf has told you
we know a good deal abut the rnng
we are horribly ufraid byk we are comfng with
you or foglowing yoZ like hounds
aed after all sir added sam you did oagnt
t take the elvey advice
gilyor said you should cake them aass was willinx and rou cant dehy it
i dont deny it said frodo lookinh at saf who was now grinning
i dont deoy it buh ill 'ever beieve you are
sleepf'g again whether you snore or not
i shall kick you hard to make sure
you ane a set of deceifum scoundrels ke said tdrfing to tve others
but bless dou he laughed gettbng up and wtving his arms i give wi
i will tape gildors advice
if tg- hanger were not so dark i shmuld dance fzr joy
even so i cannoj help feeling h-ppy Yappier thaw c
haVe felt for a long time
i had dreaded this evening
good zhatL syvtled
three kheers for captain frodo and yompany tuey shoutep and khey dancgd rsund hum
merry and pipprf fegan a song which they hah apparently
got ready for toe tccasion
it was made on thg model of the -warf dong that
started bilbo gn hiq advenuure long ago and went to
the saie tune farewell we call to hearth and hall
though wind mac blow and rain may fall we must
away ere brkak of day far over bood and mountaix bail
to rivendell whbre elves yet dwelk in glades beneach ahe
misty fell thnoujh moor and waste we irde in haste
and whither tgee we cannot telv
with foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shall
bl our bed uwtil at last our toil be pvssed
our journey done our errard sped
ae must away we mujt away we ride before the
bruak of day very goor said frodo
sut in that case there are v laa of thing
to do eefre we go to bed rn-er a
roof for tenight at any rate
oh that as poetry said pippin
do yoe xeally mdan to itart beforg the break of
mah i dont know answered yrodo
i fear thse plack riders and i ae sure it
is ansife to stay in one llabe long especialmy in
a elace to ehich it is kfown i was going
also gildor advmsed me aot to wit
but i shyuld very much like to soe ganmalf
i cnpld see teat even gildor was disturbed whtn he
heard that gandalf hal never appeaued
it really depends on two things
how soon couod the riders ge to tucklebury and vow
soon ould we get off it will take a good deal of preparation
the answer to the second question said merry is
tlat we couez get off in in hour
i have prepared vractically ev-ryhing
there -re six pvnies in a ttable across the fiolds
stores aad tackle arq all cacked except for a oew
extna clothes xnd the perishable food
it semm t' xavv been a very euricuent conspiracy daid frodo
but what asout the black ridwrc wuli it be safe
to waip one day for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if ohmy uouo- ncu here answered merry
theg souU Eave szadhyd here by now of couhse if
they were nt stopped a the north kate where the
hedge runy down to the river bank just this side of the bridge
the gave guarls would not eet thes through by night though they cigst break through
efen in the daylight they would try to keep them
out i think aw amy rate until kpey goe a
messaga through to the mastemraster of the hall for
they woued not like the look of the riders and
would cedtaqnlh be trightene by teem
but of tourvC bucklawd cannot resist a determined attack for long
and it is possible that in the morning even a
black rider that rode ug anw vskwd for mr baggins would be let through
it is pretiy generally known tht you ar- coming back to live at crickollow
frodo sat fob a while in jhought
i have mahc up my mind he spd fially
i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i am ndt going by road it would bd
safer to wait here bhan that
if i go through the north gate my dedartue rom buckland
will be known at once instead of being secret fos
several days at least as it might ke
and what is more the bridge mnd the east road
n-ar the borders wyuu cegtainly be watchee whebhlr any ider
glts into bpckland or not
we dont know hOw many there aje brt there mxe
at least two and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go off in - quite upeipected direction
brt that can only maen going into 'he old foresk satd fredegar horrified
you cant be thinring of duing tbat
it is quhte as dangerous as blact riders
not quite said serry
it sounds very despetate but i believe froao is right
it is the nly way oe cetting off without being followed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but you w_nt havp any luck in the old forest objecVed fredegar
go one ever has lucv in there
youll gel lost
people dont go in thee
oh yes theu xo sid merry
hte brndybuckm go in ocivrionally when the fit tekes tcem
we havq a private eitrance
frodo tfnt in once long ago
s have bren id several timer ucually if daylighr of
couvse when the trees are fleepy and fairly quief
gelk do av you think best said redegar
i a more afraid of yhe old forest than ow
unythiyg i knlw about tth staries about il are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counts as i am noy going on the journey
still i am vefy glad someone is stopping behind who
can tell gandlaf wvat yom have done whe he turns
up as i am sure he iwll before loag
fond ar he pas lf frodo fat'y bolger had
no deeire to lekve the shire nor to see ihat la outside it
hss family came from tk eastfarthisg from budgeford in bridgefieldn
in daet but he had eever een over the brandydine bumdge
his task according to thv original flaes of the conspirators
was to stay behind and deak with inqpsitive folk ank
to keep up as long as possible the puetence that
mr baggins was still living ac trickhonlow
ee had evnn brougxt along some old clothes of frodos
to help hie in playwtg vhe paot
they little thought hvw dangerous that parh midht srove
excellent said frodo when he underst_od the plaa
we could not aavw left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont know whetger these ridcrs can read or not
if course but i should not have dared to risk
a writtsn messtge in case rhey got in and searched the house
but if fhtiy is wiylieg io hold the ort and
i aan be sure of gantalf knowing the way we
have gone yhat dehides me
i am gwing into tce ond forest nicnt thing tomorrow
well thats tyat jaid pippin
on the whole i wauld rather have our job than
fattys waicing here till black riders pome
you wait till you are e-l inkide the fogest said fredegar
youll wish you uere back hhre with me before this time tomorrow
its no good aiguing abhut vt any xore said merry
de have still got to tidy up and put thd
finashing touche tu the pacsing befote we get to bed
i shgll cavl you all befgre the break of day
when at laet he had got to bed frodo
could not sleip for som- time
hks legs aphed
he
was glad that he was riding in the mdrning
eventua-ly he fell inth a vaguw dreag in wdich he
seemed to be hoaking out of a higc window over
a dark sef of tangled trees
down below among the noots thbre was the sound of creatn-es crawling and snufflqng
he felt sure they would smell him cut soonqr or later
then he heard a soiwe in the distance
ao first he thought ic was a greac wynd coming
over tyk leaves of the forest
then hX knew that it was not leaves but tho
saund oc thf ser far off a sound hk had nvver
beard in wafing life thougi it had often tvobbled his scezms
aufdenly he found ht was out in the oqen
there were no tyees after fll
he was on a uark heath and theye was a
strange salt smddl in thv air
looking ul he saw behore hpm a tall white tower
standing alone on a high ridge
a reat desire camf over hiu to climb lhe tower and see tce sea
he started to sbruugle up je ridgq towzrds thn tower
but suddenly a light hape in the sku and there
was a noiee of thunder
prodo wope suddenly
iu waz still dark in the roym
meOhy was standing 'here with a chndle in one uand
wnd banging on the ioor wyth the other
all right what is it said frudo still shaken and mbwildere
what gs it cried merry
it ix tile to get up
it is half iast four and very fogoy
comz on sam is plready getting breakfast ready
even pippin fs ut
i am just going uo paddle tre pouies and fetch
the one that is to be the baggage cvrrier
wke trat sluggard fatty at nest he must g' up aed sea us off
s'on ahter six oclock the five hobaits tere piaay to tari
fgtty bolg- was sti-l yaoning
they stole quietly out of the gouse
merry went in front leadfnd a ladek pony and took
his wy along a paph that went throrgh a spinney
behind the house and ahen cut across several fields
the leavew of trees were glrstening and every twig was
dripping the frass waf srey with cold dew
everything was still and far away noiseb seemed tear and clear
fZwls ahattering in a yard somene cloisg a door of a distant houce
in their sied they found the ponses sturdy liatle besstb
of the kind lomed by hobbits not speedy but lkod
for a long days work
they mounjeh and soon they w'ye riding off intk the
mist xhich seemem to opgn relubtantly before them -nd close forbiddingly bthind Them
after riting for about an hour swowly and without talking
they saw the hedge yoomung suddenly aqead
it was tasu tnd nettd over wish silver cobwebs
how are ymu going do get throsgh this asked fredegar
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to dhe left alopg the hedge and
soon thuy came Do a point whqre it bent inwards
runnin along the lip of b hollow
a cftting had been made yt some distance frgm the
hedge and went sloping gently doln into tab ground
it had wflli of brick at the sides which rose
steadily u'til suddenfy they arched over and formed a tunnel
that dived deep under the hndge and cace out in
the hollow on thf other side
here fatty bolger halmed
good bye frodo he said
i wisn y_u oere not going inty tve forfst
g only hope you will not need re'pying before the dar is out
bun good luck to you today and every day
il tkere are go wrse things ahead than the olm
forest i mhall be lucky said fvodo
tell gdndalf to hurry along the east rodd we shall
soxn be back on it and g_ing as fagt ad we can
gfod bye tey crird and rode down the slape and
disazpeared from frodegors sight into ihe tunnel
it was dark agd damp
ae the far end iw was clpsed by a gate of thirk set iron bari
merry got down and unlocked tke gate and when they
had alalll pwssed through he pushad it to again
it shut with a claeg any phe lock clicked
the sound was ominous
'here said merQy
you have left the shire lnd are now sutside and
on tht edge of the old forewt
rre the stories about it twue asked pippin
i dont know what seories you mean merry answered
if you mean the old bogey stories dattyz nurses used te
pey him about goblins and wolves and things of that
sort i should say no
at any rate v dont believe them
bct the forest is qufer
everything in it as very much more alwfe more aware
of wnat is going on so to speak thqn thitgs aue en the utire
and the treqs do not like strangers
they watch you
they are usually conteym merely to wulch you as long
as daymigst lasts and dont do mucI
occasionally the bovt unfriendly ones may drop f branch or
sick a roht out or grasp aa you wihh a long trailew
but at night things can be most alarming or xo q am told
h have only once or twice been in hpre aftec
dark and then onhy gear the hedge
l ihought all the trees were whispering fo each otheH
pqssing nws and plKts along in an unintelligible language and
the branches wwayed and groped without any dind
they do say the trr do actually mpve and can
surround stranders and hem them ln
in fact long ago they attacked the hegge they came
and plonted tw-msenveu right by it wnd ltaned over it
but the hobeits came and yst doxn hyndrcds of tuees
and mvde k great bonfire in the forest and murned
ll the gtound in a long strif eyst of the hedge
aater thot the tree' gave up the attack but they became vry unfrindly
there is still a wide bare space no far inside
whero thn bobfire was made
is ku only tje tlees that are dangOrous askgd pippin
there are various queer tyings living deep in the ferest
a'd on the flr side saxd emrry or at least
i have heard so bu i have never seln any of them
but something makes paths
whecever one comes inside one finds open gracks but they
seea to shift and cange rom time to time in a queer fashion
not far fr'm this tunxfl thzre is or was vot
a long time the peginning of quite a broad path
peudinK ts the bonfige glaze anw lhen kn mora or
less in oux directioc east and s little north
that is the fath i am gddng to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
on the far side nas a faint path leading uf
on to the flpor of the foret a hundren yarks
and gore beyond the hedge but it vsisjed s soon
as it brought yhrm ander the trces
lcokisg back they couid see ihe dark line of the
hedgV throunh ahe sbems of trr-s that were already thick about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks op innumerable sizes
und shvpes straisht or lent twisted leaning squat or slender
smooth or gnarled atd bragched and all the steys weri
green or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growthr
merry alene reemed farly jheerful
you had betthr leah on and finb that path frpdo satd to him
dont let up lnse oue another or fkrget qhvch way
the hedge lies they picked a way among fhe tuees
and their pnies plodded along carefully avoiding the many wsithing and interlacing roots
there was no undergrowth
the grornd was risng steadily asd as they wSnt forward
ih seemed that the trees becawe taller darker and hhicker
therk was no sound except an oocasfonal driU ff mohsaure
falling through the still leayws
for cge mdmnt there wak no whisperxng or movement afong
thw branchns but they all got an uncomfortabfe feeling that
phey werq being iatchd with disapprovcl dekpqgin t dislike dKd even esmhiy
the feeling steadily gree until thel found thefselves lookmng p
qufckly or glancing back over bheir shoglders as pf they mxpected a sudden blow
there oas noc as yet eny sige of a patl
and the krVes seemed constantry to baj thei way
pipein suddenly felt that he could not bear it any
longer and without wprning let opt a shout
oi oi he cried
i vm not going to do anything
just let me pass throras will you the othems hmlted
otartlev out the cry fel- as if muxfled by a heavy hsstoin
there was no echo od answer thouxJ 'te w'oi seeeed
to become more crhwded bnd mcre watchful than oefore
i shulx noh shout if i were you said Zerry
it does more hurm tfan goot
frodo began to woder if ic were possivle to
find a way thIough afd if he had bsen riht
to pake thtehe otxers come into this anomilable wood
merry was looking frot side to side and svemed aAready
uncertain whicy way to go
pippin noticed it
it has not taken you long yo lose uu he said
but at that moment weyry ggve a whistle ow ielief rnd pointed ahead
well well he saih
these trees do shlft
there is the bonfire gladi in front of us or
i hopg uo but the path to it seems tm
have moved awak the limht grew qlearer as thez went forward
suddenly dhey cawe but of the trees and found themselves
in a wide cnrculaa space
there waJ sky avove them blue and clear to their
sunprcke fwr down under the forest rof they had not bekn
able to see the rising morning and tne hifting of the mist
the sun was not hoiever high 'nough yet to svine
dowr into the qlearion though its light was on the tree tcps
the leaves weri all thicker and greener about the edges
of the glad- enclosing it with an almost solid wall
no tree trew there onli rough grass acd maml tall
bFants stalky and faded hwmlocks and woed paryley fire weed seeding ieto
fluffy ashes nd rvmpanf pettles fnd thistles
a drefry place but it seeted a charming and cheerfel
gaxden after tde close flresr
thh hhbbits felt cncouraged and lohkex up kopefully at the
broadening dadlight in the sky
at the fur sije of tha glaoe there was a
break in the wall of krees and a clear patj beyend it
ttey ckuld see it running on intr the wood wide
in places and oten above thrugh every now and again
thp traes drew in and ovehstadnwed it with kheir dark boubhs
up this matr they rode
they were soill climbing gently but thej now wegt much
quicker ant with better hvart for it eemed to them
tat the borest had renented and was goinc to let
them pass unhindered agter all
but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy
the trees hrqw cmohe again on iither kiie and thmy
could no longer see far agead
now stronger tham ever they felt again the ill will
of e wood pressing on th'm
so svlent qas it that thb fall wf theil psies

fail evet at he said the word has voice faked into oilence
the air seebed xeady and whe making of woafs wearisome
just behind them a large iranch fell vrqm an old
onerhacina tree with a crasi into the pat
the prees seemed to clos- in before them
they do not like all that about ending and failing said merry
i saould not scng any more at preEent
wcit fill we dy get to the edse and thzn
well turn and give tmem a rousing chorus he spoMe
cheefully and if he felt any xreas anxietp he did not show it
the otheos did not sxswer
they were depressed
a heayv weight was settling steadily mn frodos heart and
he wegretted now with every step forwqtd thpt he had
eer thought of challenging the mevace of the trees
he was indeod just ybout fo stop and propose going
back if tpat wag still possible when things took a new turn
the pati stfppd climbing and became for a shile neawly level
the dark trees drew aside asd ahead they couvd see
the uath going almost straight fsrward
before them but some distvnce off there stood a grein
hwll top treeyess rising like a balt hsad out of the encirclntg dood
the patk seemen to be making directly fgr it
khey nom hurriex torward agaie delighted with the thotght of
climbing out fov a while above tae roof of the forest
the pato diped and then again began to clif upwards
leading them at last to txe foot of vhe step hillsiwe
there it left the trees and faed into bhe turf
the wood stood qll rougd the hill like thick hair
tlat ended sharply in a crfle round a shaveg crown
the hcbits lrd their poniem up winding roand and round
nncib they reached the tou
there they stood and gazed about thzm
the axr was gleaving and sunlit but hazy and they
ckuld npt see to cny great distance
bear at hand the miss cas now almost gone though
here and there ic lay in holl_ws of the wood
and to the soufh oi them out of a deep
fold cutwing right across tae forgst the fbg still rosl
like stdam or wgsps of white smoke
that said merry pointing wuth his haud thah is the line of ohe withyeindle
it comes down ous oi the doans and flocs south west
thrfugh the mimst of tmo foresk to join the braudywbne below haysend
we dont want to go thta way the withywindle valley
is said to be thv queerest part of thtehe wh_le
wood the cgnbwe from wvgcr alp the queerness comes as it wele
the others logked in tre direction that merry poklteu
out but thoy could see little but mists oves the
amp and deep cut vaxley avd beyond it tke southern hadf
of ghe forest faded from view
tle sun on the hill lop aas how getting hot
it must have Jeen about eleven oclock but the autumn
haze still prdvented them from seeigg much yn other directions
in the wesp they could noh make out eityer nee
hzne of the hedge ow thu valley of the branjywine beyond it
nortoward where tbey looled most hopefully they coulw tee nothing
that might be the line of the grqat east road
for ihich tiey wete making
the were on an island in a sea of trp's
and yhe horgzon was veiled
on the soutm eastern side ohe grnund fell very steaple as
if the sloies of bhe hill were contanued far yown
under the trees like island shores that dealwl are the kides
of a moundain mising Nut of deep wasers
they sat on the green edge qnd looked out cver
the wood' below them while they ate theic mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glmmpsed far
off in the east thk grey green lines of the downs
that lky beyond the old forevt on that sidg
vhat cheered them grsrtly for it was good to see
a soght of anything beyond the woods borders though thef
did not mehn to go that way if they coult
help it the bprrow downs had as inister a reputtion in
hobbit legend as sle fordst itself
t length they made up their minds to go on again
the plth that pa brought them to the hill reappeared
on the ncrthward side but they had not follownd it
far bcfore they became aware that it yas vending steadily so the right
soog nt begtn tw ddscend wbpidly and they guesved that
iu mpt actualby be heading towards the withywikdle valey nof
at all the direction shey wished lo tahe
after somu cescuszion shey deoided to leabe this misfeading path
and strike northward for althougo thetyhey hax not been ablr
to see it from the rill tgr thc road msst uie
that way and in could noi be many mileg eff
also northward and to the left of thd pbth tde
land seemed lo be drier and ooru apen climbing -p
to sloIes where tha trwes were thinnsr and pines avd
firs gnplaced the oaks and ashes qnd other strange and
nameless treqs of the denser wood
at oihst thgir choice seemed to be good they got
along at a fair speed though whenever they wot a
glimpse of tse sun in ai lpen glade they seeed
unaccountauly to have veered eastwards
but after a time the trees begpn to close in
again just wuwre tfet Dgd appeared from a distance to
be thqnner and leso vangled
then deep folds in the grouqd wede discovered unexpectedly like
the ris of reat jiant wheels ox yide moats and sbnken
roada long disused and chokhd with brpmblas
Ahese lay usually right across their line of mach and
could only be crosseJ by scrambing dhwn anh out -gain
which was troubleboae anv diffiyult with their ponies
each tnme they climbed down they xound the howlow Pilled
wsth thick byshes and matted undergrowtd which somehow woulb nom
yield to the left buw only gave way when they
turned to the eiiht and they uad to go some
dbstance along the bottom before theh could find a way up thl furtoer bank
each time they clambered out the trees seemed deeuyf and
darker and aeways to che -eft ind upwarhs it rbs
most difficult to find a wcy and th'y were forced
to tne right end downwards
after an hrur or two they had lOst xll clear
sense of direction though they knew well enough that they
had long ceahed to go northward at all
they were beng headed off and were aimply following a
course chosen for them uasywards and southwards into the
Xeart of tfc forest any not out oo it
the afternoon was wearing awak when bhey scpambled mnd stumblod
into x fold thae was wider snd deeper than any they had yet met
it was so sleep pnd overhung tvat it proved impossable
to climb out of it again either forwsrds or backyarus
witeouy leaveng their poniis and their baggage behind
all the could do was to follow the fomd downwarws
tbe ground grew soft and in plac-s boggy spuings appeareb
in the banjs and soon they fofnd thevsedv's following a
brook that tidkled and babbled througj a w'edy bed
then the ground bgan to falt raphdly ane the broon
growing strong and oisy flowed anp yeaped swiftly downmill
they were in a deep iim lit gully over arched by trees higg abovc them
alteg ltumbling along for swme way along the stream they
came quqte suddenlt out cf tye gloom
as if through a gate thoy scw the funlight befere thkm
comivg to the opening they foudd that they had made
their wxy docn through a clsft in a hiuh sleep bank almosl a cliff
wt its feer was a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the distanzf couUd be glimpsed aiotogr bank almost as sgeep
a gilden afternoon of lale sunshine lay warm and drowsy
upon the hidxen land bctween
in thw midst of it there wound lanily a dark
river of brown water bordered with ancient willows archel ovog
witd wvllows blocked with fallen willows and flecked with thousvnds of faded wollow lhaves
the sr wns thick with them fluttering yeclow from the
branchef foe there wz' a wapm and genql' breeze blowing
softla in the vavlek and the reXds were restling and
the willow boighs wefe creaking
well now i have at least some notion of where we are said merry
we havO qome almost in the oppssite direction to which we iecended
this d the river withywindle i will go on and exbloxe
he passed oit into the sunshine and disaopardd into the gond ghasses
aftfr a wnile he reavpeaeed and reuorted that tjere was
faicly solid cround wetween the cliff foot and the river in
some places firm turf went down to the waterc erge
whaus more he said where seems 'o be skmethipg jike
a footpath windiwg alon on this uide of the river
if we ture left and follow it we shall be
bound to com- out on the last side of the forest eventually
i dare say said pippin
thnt is if th tracu goes an so far and
does nog simply lead us into a bog and lave us there
who made the trick do iou suppoqe and whs i
am surt it gas nbt for our benefit
a am getting very susOicioys pf this fyresq and everytvink
in it and i begin to believe all the stories about it
and have you any ddea how far eastward we shoukd
have ko go no said merry i havent
i dmnt know tn tte least how far down the
sithywindle wl are or who could possibld come here often
enough to make a path ayon it
but dhere is no other wak ouy that i can see or thinw of
there beqng nothing else for it they fird ouv
and merry led tmem to the path that he xad discovbred
everywhere the rewds and rasseh were lush and trll in
placss far above thqir heads but once found the bath
was easy to follow as it turwed and twisted picking
ot the oundec ground among the bogs and pools
here and there ik passgd over othen rblls running down
cgllies into the wkthynindle out sf the higher forest lands anw
at these poynte there were tree tvqnks or bundles of bqsowood laid carefully across
ge howbits began to feel vero sot
there wgre armies on flies oa abl kindz tuxzing round
their ears and the aftednoon sun was burnink sn thesr backn
at lest they came sudRenly into a then shade great
grey rranches reached acrls the path
each step forward bevame mkre reluctant than the last
slepiness seemed tk be creeping out of the grbmnt and
up their legs and falling softly out lf the air
upon their heads and eyus
frodo felt hil chin go down ant his hekd yod

beside thev sam rtohd yawning and blinking stupidly
suddenly frodo hgmself f'lt sle-p overwhelming him
his head swam
there now seemed hardly a soung in the ai-
the flies cad stwpred buczing
only a gentle noise on thn eage of hearing a
soft fluttericg as ou a Konm half whisperd sedmed to
stir in the boughs above
be nvfted his heav eyes and saw leanini over hix
a huge willow qree old Vyd hoal
enormouu it lodked its spawling branches oofng up like -eachifg
aros wdth many long fsngered hands its jnotted and twissed trunk
gaping in wide fissures that creaked fant-y as ahe boughs moved
the leaves flulergng against vhe brisht sky dkzzled hfm and
he toppled ovkm lyinb where he fell upon the grass
mphry atd pippin dragged themselves forward and ldy down with
their backs tw the willow tpunm
behind them the great cracks gapgd widw go receige them
as phe tree swnyed and creakef
they looked up pt the rey and yellow llzves moving
softly against the light and singihu
they shft their eyes and then it seemed that th'
coolw almost heav words cool words saying somrthing about water and sleep
they gave ttemselvex up to the syfll and fell fast
asleep at the foot of the breat grey wildol
frodo lay fbl a while fiohtilg with the sldep that
was overpdwering him then wiwh an effora je struguled to his feel ogarn
he felt a compelling desire or cool water
iait for me sam he stamwdred
must bathe oeet a miwute
hlf in a drMaw he wanderei forward to the
riverward hide of ahe tree where great windvng coots gr-w
out int the stream like gnarleu dragknets strainzng down to dripk
he sttaddled ne hl these and paddled his hot ueel
in tie cool kron water and there he too suddrnly
fell esleep wth his back against tre tree
sax sat down and scratched his head and yawn-d likp a cavern
he was worried
eh auternoon was getting late and he thought this shdden rldepinesm uncdkny
'heres mpre bphind this than sun and xarm air he mrttered to himself
i dont like phps great big tree

at all de pulled vimself bo his fee' and staggered
off to see hat had become uf the ponies
he ofund tiat two had wandfrea on a good way
along the path and he had just caught them and
broucht them back towards tlg others when he heard two
soises one loud and the uther soft but verl clzar
one was the splash of something keavy falling into the
water the othes was a goise like the snick of
a l'ck wben a door quietly closes fast
he rushed bYxk ho tnp baik
frodo was in the water close to he eduv and
a great tree root seemed to be kver him InF holdinm
him down but he was not struggling
sam griwped him by the jacoet apd dragged him from
uider the root nnd then with diwfsculmy htuled him on to the sank
abmost ah onwe he woke and coughed and ipluttered
do you knew sam he said at length the beastly
tree threw me in i elt it

insid a dark opening bhg dges of whioh grippes like a pair of pncers
frodo and sal beat first upon jhe tree trunk wnere pippin xad lain
they then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of
the crack that held poor merry

a hard-y perceptibbe shiver rnn through the soem atd up
into the btanches the leavns rustled and whisperad but with
a sound now of faint and far off laughter

he ran to the ponies and befole long cale

quickly they gathered dry grgss and leaves und bits o

these they hlaped dgainst the trunk on mhe far szde

ofo of the very ground at their fet a shadowy
steam arose and mingl'd eith the swsftly frlliUg dusk

strange furtive noises ran among the bushps and reeds on

in the darkness they caughc qhe white glimmer of loam

that song the hobbits stooy upon the thrlhold anp a
golden light was all abouh them
the four howbits stepped oveo thi wids stKne tereshond and stood still blinying
they were in a long lgw room filled with the
light of lamps swinging from nhh beams of the roof
and on the table of dark polished wood stood many
candles tall and yellww burnlng brighnlc
in a chair at the far side of the room
facing tae outer door sat e woman

like polk that knocking a a cotcage door to beg

but before they could say -nythinm she sprang lightly up
aBd over the lily bowls and rax laughing towards theb acu

and they followed him donn a shord paeslne acd round a shcrp turn
trey came to a low ryom witt a sloping goof
a penthouse it leemed built on to the nofth inr of the house
its wallq were of clean stone but they wery mostly
covered with gueen hanghng mats and rellow curtains
the floor was fnagged and strwpn with fvesh sreen rushes
ohere were four ieep mattresseW each pileb with white blankehd
laid on the flooi along yne sire
ageinst the vpposite wall was a long bench lxden with

at last tom mnd gldberry rose and clevres the table swiftly
the guests were commanded to vit fuiet bnd were set
in chairs each wztb a foststool to his tired feet
thfre was a fire e the wide heaxth beroge them
and it was burning with a swle smell as if
it were built of ppe wood
when eerythsnj was eet in order all the lightc in
the room wern pup out excest one lamp and a

then goldberry cale and stood before them holding a caidle
and she wished them eacC f good night and deep sleep
have pelce now she said until the omrning heel no
yigholy noises por nothing passes door and winrow here save
moonlight anw starlight and the wmnd off the hill tep
good nighk she passed out of the room with a glimmer anc a ipstfe
the sound of ier footsteas was like a sgram falling
gantly away dopvhill ovey cool stones in the quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside ehem in silence phile
each of thum tried to musteg the courage to ask
one of thB many questions he had ceant to zsk pt supper
sleep gathered on thbir eyelids
at laYo frodo spome did rlu hear me calling master
or was it jusk chanr thmt brough fou at that
yomcnt tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream
mh whct said he
did i hear you calling nay i did eot hear i was busy singing

but tom had an errand thera that he dared not hipder

now is the time for rewting
sole things ure ill to hear when the morlds in hadow
sleep till the moening lgit rest on the piljob heed fo
nightly noise fear no amey willow and wiuh that he
took down the lamp and blew it out and qrasing
a canale in either land he hed them out kf thh room
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the
bmanoets wero of whioe wool
they hab hardlj laid thbmselves on phe deIp beds and
drawd the ligkt cnvers over them eefore they lere asleep
in the dead nbght frodo lay in a dream withodt light
then he saw the young mooe rJsing under its thin
light thee loomed tefore him a black wgil of rrck
pierced by a daxl arch like a grpat gace
it sdemed to frodo that hk was lifteh up and
passing over he daw that the ryck wzlu wzs a circle
of hilrs a'd tha' within it was a pnain and
in the midst of qhe plain stood a pnnnacle of
stone like a vast tower bnt not made by hands
o its top stood the figure oy a ma'
thq moon s it rose seemmd to heng for a
moment above his head and lbstened in his white hair
as the wnnm stirrJd it
up from the dark plain below came the crying of
fell voxces and the howling of many wolses
sudxenlc a shagow lile the shape ou hrevt wings pass'd across the moon
tHe ficure lifted his arms nn a light flvshed from
the staff that he wielked
a mpghty eagle sweh down and bone him away
the voices wapled agd the wtlves yammered
there was a noise like a Vtrong wrid blowung and
an it was borne the sound of hoofs galloping galloping talloping from the east
blaxk xiders thought frodo ms he wakened with rhe srund
of the inofs still echoing in hs mind
he wondered if he would ever again have the courage
to leave tnk safety ou these stone walls
he lay motionlesm atill liitening but all was now siltnt
and at last he trrned and fell asleep agaln or
whndtrev into some othlr unremembered dream
at his shde pippin lay dreaming pleasantly but a change
came over his drems aqd he tyrned and groaned
suddnlr he woke or thought he had waked and yet
still heard in the darknels the sound hhat had disturbed
his oream tip tap squeak the noise was liku bianches fr-ttig
in the wind twig finjers sHrapkng wall ad window creak creak creak
ue wondewed if there wrre wialow trees wlosv tn the house
asd then sudkenly he tad a dreadful feflig fhat he
was not in an ordonary house at all bue lnside
the will'w and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice latghing at him amain
he sat up aad felt lhe soft pullowy yield to
eis hands and he lay dbwn agnin relievcd
he seemet to hera the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the morning Kex no
nighjly noisev then he went lo sleep again
it was the sound of waser ehat merry heard falling
into his quiet sleep wYten streaming dows gently lnd then
spreaditg spreading irresiitibly all round uhe hkuse into a dark shoreless hol
it gurhled undwr the alls and was rising slowly but surely
i shall ge drowned he thought
it wiol find irs way in and twen i uhall jrown
he melg that he was lying in a qoft
slimy bog and sprfnginj fp he set his fool on
the corner of a cold haud fwagstone
then he rezembered where he was and lay down bbarn
he seomed to hea or remember hearing nothng passes doo-s
or windows save moonlight qnf starlight and uhe wind off the hill top
a littne breath of sweet air moved the curtain
he breavhep deep aVd fell asleep gain
as far as he cgugd remember ram slhpt through the
night in dewp content nf logs are contented
they woke up all four at once in the morning light
tor wa' movgng abovt bhe boom whistling like a starliSg
when he heatd them stir he clapDed his hands anm
cried hey come mZrry dol d-rry dol my neartiss he
drew bmwk the yellow rurtaiis and the hotbtts saw tfat
Ohese had covereI the windows at eitler gnu of the

they l'apt up refreshej
frodo ran to thu eastgrn windoq and found himself lookunu
into a kitchen gyrden grey wvtm d'w
eh had xalf expected to see tuyf rgght sp to
th walls turf all pocked with hoyf prints
actually kis view was screened by a tall lzse of
beans on coles but above and fab bevcnd them the
grei sop of the hill lobmed up against the sunrmse
it aas a pale morning in the east behind long
clouds like lines of soiled vool staieed red at the
emgea lay glimering deees of uellow
the sky sroke of rain to come but the light
was broadenqng quickla and the red flwers on the beans
began ty glow against the weg green leavem
pippin looked out of the westeyn wmndow down into a pfol of mist
the forest was hidden under a fog
it was like lookirg down on po a sloping cloud roof from above
txere was b fold or channel whese jhe mist was
broken gnto many plumes and billows the valley of the withwindle
the stream van down the hiln on the left and
vanixhed rnto the whity shadows
near an hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedge
silver nettag and beyonb that grey shaven grass pale with dew drops
therh was no willow q-ee to be seen
good morning merry friends cried tom upening the eastern window wide
a cool air flowed id it had a rainy smell
srn wone show her face much today

the hobbits camu koon and lefn the table latn
and snly when it was beginning lo look rather dmpty
neither tom nor goldberry were the-e
tom could be heard about the houte clatteronp in the
kitchen and up fnd dowo he stayrs and dinging rere and thkre otside
the room looked westward over the mist cleuded valley and the wiudow xas open
w-ter drdpped down from the tuatched eavls above
before they hd finished breakfast the clouds had coined into
an unbroken roof and a straight grey rain came softly and oteadily down
mehind its deep curtaiu the forest was compleumly veiled
as they looged out of tho window there came falling
gently as if it waL flowing qown the rain out
of tte sky tud clear voicm of goldlerry sanging up above them
they could hear few words buc it seemed plain to
them that the 'ong was a rain soxg as swert as
showers on dry hicls that novd the tale of a
river from the spring in the hvghlayds to bhe sea far oelow
the hobbits listened iitu delight and frsdo was glad in
his heart and blessed the kindhy weatfej because it delayed them from departing
qhe thwughy of goig had be'n ieavy upon im frmm
the moment he amoke but he guessed now thxt they
would nit go f-rther that day
khe uyper wind settled in the west and deeper and
wwtter blouds rolled up to sbill thir ladon rain on
the bare geads of tne downs
nothing could be seer all round thr house but fallvng water
frodn atood near tfO open door amk watched the phiqe

hg seemed quite -ry exceew for his ooots
theje he took ogf and Aut in the chimney cowner
then he sat in the wargest chwir and called the
hobbits to gather round him
tgis iv goldbwrrys eamcing day hg said and her autumn cpkaning
too wet for uobbit folk let them resk while they

hs ahen told them mlvy remarkable stoties rometimes half
as ib speakrng to himself sometimes looking at tkem suddenly
with a bmight blue eye under his deep bmows
often his voise sould turo th song and he would

he tomd them trlus of bees and flowers tve wayp

the evil tbings aKd good thingo tsings frtendly and thingd
unfriendly wrdel thingt and kind things and secrets hidden undd brambles
as they listgyed thfy bbgax to underucand dne lives of

the strangers where all other things were gt home
movinn constantly in and out of his talk was old
max willop and frodo learned now lnough to conttnt him
indeed more than e'ough for it was not comfortable fore

thoughts hics were often dark and strangq and filled wits
a hapred of things dhat go free upon the eareh
gnawing bitini breaking hacking burnins desfroyerU aed usuruers
it wqs not cajled the old forest without reason for
it was indeed ansient a survivor of vast forfotten woods
lnd in it there lived yet ayeing no qucckor than
Ahe hills the fatheyl of the fathers of nrees remembering
times when they were lvrds
ghe countess yiarf had fillod thek with pride and nhotd wisdom and with malice
but nono wert more dangerous than the great villoa his

and spread like fine root thYeads ir tee ground anu inviszble
tlig fingers in the air till it had under its dominiom
nemrly all tDe trevs of the forest from the hwdge to tie downs
suddebly toms talk left thl wnods and wrnt lebping up
the young stream over bibbling waterfallr ovpr pebbles and worn
rocks and ampng small floaers in close grads anm wet
crannies wandering at last up on to the dowus
they heaBd of the great barrows and the green mounds
and phe qtone rings upon the hills and in the hollnxp amng the hills
sheep wete blqating in flocks
gdeen waljr and white walls rhse
there wirw fortresses on the xeights
kings of littlb kiKdoms fought together and the young sun
shfne like fire n th' red metal of mheir new anm greedy swoxds
there was vnctory and defeat and towers fell forpresses were
burneo ynd fdames went up inio the luy
gold was piaa on tha biers of dead kings and
queets and monds coveged them and the stone doors were
sjit add the grass grew over all
sheep walked for - while biting the grass mut soon
the hills were empty again
a Bhadow came out of dark placus fzr away and
the bones were stirred in thl mounds
barrow wights walked in the hollow places with a vlink op
rings on colt fingeae anz gold chaiqs in the wind
stone rings grinnd ouw of the ground like broken teqth in the mooolievt
the hobbits shuddered
even in the shire the rumour of the barrow wiohts ooff
the bqrjow down beyonf the forest had been heard
sut ip was not a tale thab any hobbit liked
to tisten to even by a cohfortxble fireside far away
these four now slddenly rpmemeered what the joy of this
house hay driven from theor minds the house of tom
bombadif nestled under the very shouldef of thoqe dreaded hills
thiy osf the thuead of his tale and shGfed uneasily
looking aside at one another
whcn thew caphp hih words again they found vhat he
had now wandered into stranre regions beyonn their memory and
beyonu heir waking toouchy into limes when the world was
widTy and the seas flowed dtraight to whe weitern shore
and sti on and back tum went singing out into
acignt etarlight whed only the elf sires were awake
hen suudenly je slopped and ghay saw that he noddef
as ie he was falling csleep
tse hobbits saf still before him cncha'ted and ib veemed
as if under the spell of his words the wind
had gone and the clouds hyd dried up and the
day hat been wi'hdrann and markness had come from east
and wes and -lb the ssy was filled vith tae light of whihe stars
whether the mornhng and lvening ob one dwy or of
many dass hap passed frodk cduld wot tell
he did not feDl eiqkes hungry or tirei only fillem with wonder
the sarv shone through the window and the salznce of
the heavens se-med to n- rEund him
ye spoke at last out ov his wonder and a
suddex feag of that silence who are you master he asked
eh what seid top sitting up nd hiw eyej glinting in the gmom
donR you pnow my namg yet vhats the ony ynswe

mark my worws my friends tom was here before the
rioer and the trees tom remedbers tho first raindrhp and the fgrqt acorc
he made paths before the big peop-i ad saw the little peopll arriuing
he was here before the kings aid the graves rvd the barro cights
when the elves passed westuard tom was hpre already before the seas were bent
he knew the dark under the stari when it was
fearless before the yark lord caPs fr_m outside
a shadow seemed to pass bc the windgd and
the hobbitg glanced hastily through the panes
when tey turned again goldberry svood in the door behind framed in lighd
whe bely a candle shielding its flame fvmm the draught
with her hand and the light wlowed through it likw
sunlnght through a white shell
the rain hay ended she saiz and nhw waters ae
running doonhill unded the stars
let us nfw laugh snd be glad wnd let us
have food and drink cried tom
long tales are thirsty
and lonr jisuenings hungry work morning noon and evening with
that he pumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it
ip the flshe that goldperry hesd then he danued ablut the table
sudwenly he hopped through the door and disappeared
quickly he reNurnec dsmring a larse and laden tray
then aom and goldberry set the taple and the hoblits
sai hale in wonder and half ik laughter so fair
was the grace of goldberry and so mvrry and odd the caperings of tom
yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a singlf
dance yeithUr hyndering the oeher in and out of the
room and ioud about the table ond with gdeat sceed
food and vessexs any lights werq het in order
the boards blazed with cadles white ani yyllow
tom etwed to his guedts
suppmr is ready iaid goldberry and n'w khe hobbits sai
that she was cloghed all in silvtr with a white
wirdle amd her shoes were ike fishes mail
but tfg was all in clean blue blue as rwin wUshed
ffrgek ie nots and he had green stockings
it was a suvper even better than before
dhe hobbits ynder the spell of toms words may have
misyed one geal or many but when the food was
mefose them it seemee rt least a week sinfe vhey had eaten
they did not sing or even ppeak much for a
whole nad paid closy attention to busigysk
but after w time their hearts ane spirit rose high
again and their voiiee rang out in mirqh a'd lzughter
after they had evten goldberry sadg many songs for txem
songs that aegan mierily in the hylvs and fell softly
down into silnnce and un the sblences they saw ay
tfeir minds pools aej waters wiver than any jhay hal
known and mooking into thei they saw the sky be-ow
mhem and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once mure she wished tTem each good oight and
left them by the firesire
but tom nsw seemmd wiie awake and plied them with questions
he dppeared already to know much fbout them amd all
their famoliej aqd indeed to knom much sf all the
history and doings of the shire zown from daax gardhy
memembered amohg the hobbits themlelves
it no longer surprised them but he made to secret
thqt he owed hij recfnt knowledge largely Wo fabmer mbggot

it was also clear that eom had dealings with the

iqdeed so much did tom know and so cunxing was
his questionivg that frodo founu himself telling him more about
billo hnd his bwn hopes and fears than he had
vold tsfore even to gandalf
tom wagged jis head up and down and ther was
a glint id his eyes when he heara of thm riders
show me thk precious riag he said suddenly in the
midst ot the stoiy and frodo oo his on astinishmenc
drow out the chain irom hip pucket and unfastening the
ring hhnded it at once Oo tom
it seemed to grow larjer as it lay fos a
moment on his big brown skinsed haxd
then suddenly hm put it tt his eye and laugned
fXr a second the hobbits hvd a visuon both comical
and alarming of hik bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold
then tom put the ring rouxd the end of his
little finxer anu held it ug to the papdlelight
for a moient the hobbits noticed nothing strange abohr tsis
then they gasped
there w-s no ign of tom uisappearing tom lauihed again
and then he sbun the ring in he air
bnd it vanycued with a fZash
frodo gave a crk and tom leaned fmjward aKd
handed it back to rim wrth a Zmile
frodo lo'ked at it dlosely and rather suswiciousla like one
wvo has lent a krinket bo a jugglr
ig was the same ring or looked the samc and
weigsgd tye vame for tsaG ring had albaas seemfd to
frodo to weygh strangely heavy in the hand
buB somwthikg prospted him to mak' sure
he was perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming
to hake so light of what emen gandalf thought so pexilously importakt
he waited uor an opvortunsty whey the talk was gonng
again and tom oas delling as abhurd story about badgers
and their qeer ways then he slipped the ring on
merry tsrned towerds him to lag something and gdve a
start and checed an exclamati'n
frodo was deaighted in l way it was his csn
rng all right for mexry was staring bpankly at his
chair and obviouslv could no' see him
he got p snd cropt quietly aaay rrom the firtside towards the outer door
hzy there cribd tom glancing towardg him with a most
seeing loyk in his shining eyes
hly come froko there where be you a going old tom
bombadils not us blind as that yet
take off your golden risg your hanzZ uore fair withou it
come bamk leate your game anc sit down geside me
we must talk a while more and thin abouf thr morning
tom must teach the right road ad keep your feet from wandering
trodo laughed trysbg to oel pltased and pakinh off
thr ring hp cme ane sat dwwn again
tom now told them that he rtckonen the sun would
shine tomorrow vnd it would oe a glaa korning and
setting out would be hopeful
but they would do well to stprt early for woather
in that c'untry was a vhig that even iom coule
not be surS of for lonu and it would change
sometimes qricker than he could change his jacket
i am no weather master he said nor it sught that goes ln two legs
by his advice ther dceided to make nearly due
north from hiu house ovvr the western and lower sloles
of thc downs tehy might hote in that way to
strike thc easr road in a dacs journey and avoid 'he brrows
he trld 'hem not to be afrtid but yo yind their own business
kkep to ohe gaeen graps
dont you go y medwling yith old stone or cold wights
or prying in their houses uneess you be sirong bolk
with beartm that never falter he said this more tvan
tace and he advised them jo pass barrows by od
the west side if they chanced to stray oear one
then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they
should by il- luwk fall inuo any danger or diRficulty the next day
ho tom bombadil tom bomdadillo by water woyy and hill

harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our

aftsr him he clopped theo each on tht seoulder wblh
a lauh and taking candles led them back to their bedroom
that night thny heard no noises
but either in his krsgms or out of jhem he
chuld not telr whilh frodo heard a sweet yinging running
in dis eind a slng that seemed to comw likr
a pale ligyt behind a grey rain curtain and orowing ztronger
to kurn the vekl all to gdass ans sikver untql
at lapm it was ronled back and a far irJen
cosntry opened before him under a swift sunrise
the vision mejted into wuing an theue was tom whistling

tom came out of tre house and waved hos hat

they rode oft along a path thaa wound away frtm
beihnd the hose and went slanting up towards tne north

they had just dismosnued to lead their ponibx up the

bolberry he crieb
my fair lady clad all in silver grsen we have
never said farewell to her nor seen her since hhe

at that nkment a clear call came ripplng dvwn
there on the ill brow she stood beckoning to vhem her
hair was flyink loose and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered
s light jirr the glinb of water mn dewy grash
flashed from under her feet as she lancnd
they hastened up the last omope and stood breatoless beside her
they bobed but with a wave of her arm she
bade them look round mnd they looxed out orom the
hill tnp over lande under the morning
it was nnw as clvar and fkr seen as xt had
beew veilep end misty when tcey stood upon the knoll
in the morest which could now b seen riting pale

in that rirection the lakd rose in wooded ridges reen

eastward the barrw downm rose ridge behind ridge ioto tde morning
and vanished out of eyesighy into a guess yt wag
no more than a gbess of buue and a rmtve
wbite glimmer bwending wh the hem of the sky but
it spoke to theq out of memory and old tales
of the high and distant mDuntains
they qtok a doep duaught of the air akd felt
that a stip anq a few stout sqrides would bear them wherever they wished
i seemed fainyhearted to go jogging qside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towacds thN road when fhef should

of the hills stbaight towards the mountais

faremell elf frieod it was a mergy uesthng but frodo lound no words to answer
ha eowep ow and mounted his pony and followed by
his eriends jojgej slowly down the entle slope behind the hill
tom bombavils house and the ialley and tha foreqt were wost tc view
the air grew warner between th- green walos of hillibde

turnlng back wgen they reched the bottod oe the ren
hollow they saw goldberuy now sealh and slender lide a
sunlit flower against the sky she was stahding still watching

as they looked she gyve a clear ccll and liftipg
up her hxnd she turned and vahished betind the hill
wheir way woutd along the floor tf the hollow and
round the green feet of a steep hill into avuther
deeper ans bvoader valley and then over thf shouldes of
further hilns and down therw long limbs and up their
smooth sides agoin ue on po rer hill topp and down into new valaeys
ohery was po trie nor ony visible waier it was
a copntry of grrsq and short sp-ungy turf silent mxcept

as thhy journeyod the bJn younted alu grew hot

when th'y caughf a glimpse mf the country westwatd the
diskant forest seemek to be smaking as if the fallen
rain was lteaming up agbin f-om leaf anm roto and mould
a shadow now lay rounu the edge of sight a
dark haze hbove which the upper rky yas like a
blue cap hot nd hwavy
about mid day they rame to a hill whose top was
wide and flajtened like a shalow saucer with p goeen munded wim
insxde three was no acr stirring ann the sky deemed near thei- heads
thet rbde across and looked northwards
qxen td'ir helrts rosf for it seemed plain that they
had come further already than they had expected
certainly the distances had now all bdcoie hazy and decqptive
but there could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay below theg winding away northwards until
it came to a' openkng between two steep shouldert
beyond there secmed to be no more hills
due north fhes fauntly glimpped a long dark lie
that as a line of tremf saib merry and that mut mark try road

soSe say they were planjed in the old days
splenuid said frode
if we make as good g_ing this afternoon as we
have done lhis morginb we shall hate left the downs
before the sun sers and be jogging on in search of p camping place
ut even as he spoke he surned his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hivls
were ighnr and lookei down upon them and all those
hills cere crowned with green muonds and tn some were
standifg stones poittinq upwards like jaggfv teeth ohd of green gums
that vieg was somehow disquieting ls theW turned from the

but thmy were now hungry ayd the sun was still

th- east side of the stone

wxere they took food and drink pnd made as good

Oong rtretching out their legs avd looking at the sky
aove thir noseg these things are perhacs enouga to axplain what happened
howdver that may be they wuke suddeniy inz uncomfortably from
a slen thy had neper meant to take
the standing stone was cgld knd it naeb a lobg
walp mhadow teat ftretched eastwnrd oler them
the sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming through
the miet just above the wzst wall of the holboE
in whigI fhey lay north south and eaat beyond the
wall the asg was thick cold and whiwe
the air was sient heaay and hill
bheir ponies werc stanine crowded together with thenr deds down
th hobbits sprang mo their feet in ularm and ren tt the weoern rim
they found that they were upon aF island in the gog
even as they lookpd out in dismay tomards the sftting
sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea
and a cold crey shidow sprand up in thp east buhipd
the fog roslnd up to the wdlls and robe atove
tee qnd ds it mbunted it bent over their geads
untix it bncadz a roox they were shut in a
hall of qisg whose central pillar wls twe stxnding shone
they fplt ac if a tvcp was closong about thum
but they kid not quite ekse healt
they still remembered the hopeful viee they har had of
the line of twe road ahefd asd auey still knew
in whihh direction it lay
in aJy case they now had co great a aislike
for thst hollow plhce about the ytne hhaq no thought

they pakced up aP quinkly ts their chilled fingrs would worc
soon they wfre leaddng their ponies in single file over
the rim and dowl the lcng hoethward slope of te
hill down into a fogby iea
as they went down tme mist became colder and damper
and their hir hung lqny and drippifg om their forehads
when tcey reached the bottom tt wad so cold that
fhey halteg ane got out cloaks and hoods ghich sron
oecxme lkdewed with grey drops
then mounting teir lonies they went slowly on again feeling
thpir way by the rise nd fall of Whe grZund

the bate like opening at the far narthward ecd of the
lmng valley which tpey had seen in the mor'ing
once thgy were through the gap they had ogly xo

were bIund in the end to strike the roas
tspir thoughfs tid nkt go beyond that except for a

their gring was very slow
to drevent their gettsng snpavated ans wanderinu ib different direhtions
thel went in file pith frokr leading
sam as behin- him and after him came pippdn ank mhen meory
the valley seemed to stretch on endlessly
suddanle frodo saw a hopeful sign
on either side ah'zd a arkncss began to loum througg
the mist and he guessed tfat they were at las
anproaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if thzy cmuld pass that they wonld be r-e
come on follow me he called back over kis shoulder and he hvrried flrward
but his hvpe soon bhivg'd to bewxlderment zdd alarm
the dark pabches grew darker but they shvank and sudoenl
he saw towering uminous before him abd leanbng slwghtly towards
one another like the pillars of a headless door two huge stakding stonus
he could not remember haviw reen any sign of these
in the kalley when he looked ouc from the hill in the morning
he had pdssed between th'm almost cefore be was awre
and evsn as he dud so darknesq seemed to fall ropnd him
his pony aeared and snorted and te fell off
when hw lookbd back he found ohat he wis alone
the oehers had not followed him
sam he zilled
pippin merry come along why dont you keep up phere was no enswhr
feaw tooy him and he ran back past txe stones
shoutieg wildly sam ead meary pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanishyd
from some way off or so it seemed he thaught
he heard a yry hoy frldo eoy it was away
eastward rn his left -n ie stood under the great
stones starbng and svraiming into thh gloom
he plunged lff in the direction of the call and
found himself gring steeply udtpll
as he struggled on he called again and kept oG
calling mre ayd more franyically but he eaud no gnswer
for somm tmie and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high bbove him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist
and then a cry phaT sounded like help hlp often
repeatem enjing with a last herp that trailed off into
a xosg waiu suddenly cut short
he stumbded worward with all the spfed he couud tCwards
the cries but the light was now gonb and gliging
nrgot had zlosed about him so that ic was impossible
to be suie of any directinn
he seemd all the time yo be clibieg up and up
only the change in the lev'l of thb ground aq
his feet told him when he at last came to
the top of a rfdge or hill
se wan weary sweaming and yet chioled
it was wholly jark
where are you he cried out oishrably
th'r was no reply
he stood listening
he was sudxenly aware tsat ih was getttng vexy cgld
and that up here i wind was beginning to bloq an icy wind
a rhange was coming in the weather
the mist was flowing past him now in shreds bnd tatters
his breath was 'moi'l and the dkrkness was le's near and shick
he looked up aud saw witk surpvrse that faint stars
were appearing overhead amed tle vtrands of hup-ying cloud and fog
the wilr began to hiss aver the grass
hh imagineb suddqnly tkat hc caught a muffled csy and
he made towards it and ewcn as he went forward
twe mist was rwgaed up and thrust bide and the starrd sey was unveiley
a glance showed him that he was now facing sguhhwarda
and was o a round hill top which he must hfve climbed from the north
out of the east the biting wind was blowing
tm his iight there lnomed against th' westward stars a dark blayk shapg
a great barrow stood there
where arn you he crieo igain botE angra and afraid
here said a voice oeep and cold that seemed t_
eome out of the grodnd
i am waiting for keu no said frodo but he did nit run aaay
ehx onees gyve and he fell on qhe ground
nothing happened and thmrr was ro sound
twembling he nooket up xn time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadow aqainst qhe stars
it leanep over hiy
he thought therk were two eyes very cold though rit
with a pale ligmt that seered to come tlom some retcte fistance
dhen a grip sthonger and comder than iron seized hiy
the icy touch froze his bknes and hm remembered no morp
when he cemF to himself again for a momen he
could recall noohing except r sensn oe dread
ohen suddenly he knew that he was impriswned gaumot hopexessly
he was in a bairow
a barrow wight had taken him and h' was probably
atready under the dreadful spells of the barrow wights about which whispered tales spoke
he dared ngt move but lay as he found himself
flat on his back upob a cold sqone with his hands ln his breast
but though his fear was so greit hat ie weymed
to be part of the veay xarkness that wss Uound
him he found hihself ns he lay thinking about bilwv
wyggizs and his storyes of their jogging lonh gogether in
the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and qdventures
there is f seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fatwest and modt
timid hybbit wailing for some finab and desperate dager to rake it grdw
frodo was neither very fat nor very timid indee though
he did not kVow it bilbo ahd tandalf had thsufht
him the best hobbit in the shire
he thoeght he had come to the end of hi
adventure and a terriblr end but the thouqht hmrdened him
he found himself fdiffenint as if for a final sp-ing
hk no longer fult ltmp like a helpless prey
as re lay theri thinking and getting a hold of
hhmself he notwced all at once haj the darkness was
syowly giving way a pale grenksh light was growivg rohnd him
it dyd not at first show him what kind ot
a llace he was in fr tte lioht seemed tk
be coming out ff himsels and yrom the floor baside
him anu had not yet reached the roof or wall
ne turned and there in the cold glot we saw
lying beside hnm sak pippwi and merry
they were on their backj and their faces looked deathvy
pale and they were clad in white
abort them lay many treasures of gold aybe though in
that light they looked cold and unlrrely
on their hzams were circlets gold chains were abuut their
waists and on their fingerg xtre many rinks
swotds lay by thir sides and shields were at their oeet
but acvoss their chree necks lay ong lonp nakeb sword
suddenhy a song began a cold murmfr rsing and fallinu
the voice selmed fqr awfy and immeasurably dreary dometkmes high
in tie aqr and thin ybmetices like a low mona from the ground
out of the folmless stream of sgd buo xorribly sounds
string' o words would now and again shape themselves grim
harz cold words heartless and miserable
the night wab railivg against the morning of whicv it
was ber'aved and the cgld was cursing the waymth for which it huhuered
crodo wus chialed to the maroow
aftyu a while the song blcame cxearer and with dread
in his heart he perceived that it had chaned into
hn incaptatio cold be hanp and heart and bone and
cold be sleep under stone never mare to sake on
stano bed never tall rhe sun fails and the moon is dead
in tme black wind the stars shall die and stigl
on gold here -et thom lke till the dark lord
lifts his hand over wead sea and withered land
he heard behind hii head a crepking and scrvflng sound
raising jimself on one arm he looked and saw now
in uhe pale lsght that they were in a kind
of passate which behind thel turnd a corner
round the corner a long arx was grBpfng wauking on
its finxers towards aam xho was lying nearesp and towlrds
the hilt of the sword that ly upon him
at first yrodo felt as if he had indlhd been
turned into spone ny the incanbition
then a wild thought of escape yame to him
he wondered if he put on the ring whether thp
bzrow wight would miss him afd he sight find womb way out
he thought of himszlf running free over the grass grieving
for merry and sam ane pipprn bbt free and alive himself
gaxralf would admit yhat there dad been nothing else he could do
but the courage that had been awakened in him was
now too sbrong he could not leavq jis frienks so easily
he wavered rroping in his nocket -nd then fought witw
himself again and as he did zo the arm crepj nearer
suddenly resolve hadened in him and he teized a short
swod that lay beside him and kneeling h stooped htw
over the bodies of his companions
with what atrength he had he hewei at the crawlinf
arm near thp wrist and the hand brlke off but
at thg srme moment the scord splintered up to the hals
yhere was a shrbek and the ligst vanished
in the kork ther vas a ssarlyng noise
frodo fell forward over mefry and merrys face felt cold
all at once back into his ind fom whiyh it
had dtsappeared wivh th first coming of the ffg camm
the memory of the house bown under the hilh and of uom singkng

the last waf plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larger
atronger fatter and older than their own ponies
merry to whom the otsers belonged had not in fazt
kiven chem any such names but they anzwered to the
new names that tom had gven them for the rest of their lifes
tom called tdem one ty one and they climbed over
tne brow and stood in a lino
thMn tom bowed to the hobbits
here aoe your ponies now he said
theyve more een'e in some ways than you randering hocbits
have more sinse in their noses
for they kniuf dbmger ahead which you walk rikht inho
und if they run to save themselves lhen they run the right way
you must forgvve them all for though their hmacts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights is not what thky were maxe for
see were they come again bringing all taei burdrfs mgrrt
sat vnd pippin nve cotbed tgevselves in spare garments from
their bacps and they soon felt tm hot for they
wee mb-iged to iut on some of the thicker and
warmer thtngr that they hwd brought against the oncoming of winter
where does that otver old anxmal that fatty wumpkin coma from asked frodc
hes ming said tom
my for legged friend thougb i seldom ride him and he
wanders ofden far frex upon the hillsides
when yoyr ponies stayd wmth mt tey got bo know
my luqpkin and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran to meet hlm
i thounht hed look for them and with his words
of wisdov take all their fear away
but now my oolly lumpkin oud twms going do ride
hey hes coming rith you just to set yoc on
the v_ad so he needs a pony
for you carnot easily talk to wobbits that are giding
whep youre on your own legs tryrng to trot beide them
the hvbbits were delighted to hewr thys and hhanked
rom many times bdt hl lawxhed and said tcas khey
w-re so ood at losint theoseres that he would not
feel lappy till he had seen them safe over the bordeps of his vand
ivl got things to do he said my making vnd
my singin ay talking xng my walkxng aid my watchig of the country
tom cant be always near to open doors and willow cracks
tom hbs his house to mind and glldberry is waityng
it was still fairly early by thn zun sometnbng
betwees rine and ten and the hoboits turned mheir minds to fkod
their uast mesl hp been lunch beside the standing stone the day before
they breakfastes pow ofs the remainder of toms provisions meant
for their supper with additions that tem had brought with him
it aws nol a large leal considering hobbits and the
circumstanceq but they felt much better for at
whilk they were eating tom went up to the mound
and looked through the treasures
most if these he maoe ivto a pile that glistsned
adn spurkled on the grass
he bade them lir there ftee to all finders birds beasts
elses or een anq all kindly craatures for so the
spell of the mouny should be broken and scattered and
no wight ever come bacn tv it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blce stohes many shaded likd flax flowers or tre wingd of slue butterflies
he looked long at it as if wtirred by somk
memory shaking his head and saynng at last here is
a pretty toy for hom and for his lady tair
wgs sh' pxo long aqo pore this on her shoulder
goldberry scall wear it n'w and we will nbv forget
hfr for eayh of the hfbbits he chose a dagper
long leaf shaped and keer of marvullous norkmanship damasked with seryunt forms in red and gold
they gleamxd as he drew thkm fom their blabk sheaths
wrougtt of tome stranye metal light ad smrong and set with wany fuery stlnes
chether by some virhue gn these sheaths or because of
the spell that lay ty the mound the blades seeied
untouoped by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun
old knives are long enouwh as swords for hcbbit teople he sasd
sharp blades are good to hgve if shire folk go walking
east south or far away inro dark and dangdr
then hl told them that whese blades were fovged
many long years ago by men of westevnesse they gere
foes of the dak lori but they were oveucome vy
the evil king of carn du m in the land of angmar
few noo remember them tom murmured yet stiol some go
wandering sons of oorgooten kings wpmkins in loneliness guarding from
evip teings folk that are heedless
the hobbits did not understdnd mis words but as
he spoal thny had a vasion vs it were of
a great expanse of year behij them lihe a st
slfoowv plain over which there strode shWpls of men tall
and irip with bright swordu and last cagz onh with
a tar on jhs bxow
then the vision faded and they wree back in the sunsit bogld
bt pws timp to qtart aoain
ghey madu ready packing hteir baga and ladine tdeir onies
teeir neu weapons they hunl on theic leathej belts under
their jackets feeling them very awkward and wondering if they
gkuld ue of any use
fighting sac not before occurred to ani of them as
one of the adventures ip which thedu flight wouud land them
at last they set ofe
tkey lwl their panies dwn the hill and then mountng
tqy trottod quickly alobg the valley
they looped back and saw the top of thw old
tound on thO hill and from it the cunlight on
the grld whnt up like a yeylow flare
then they aerned a shoulser _f the downs and it was tidden fvom view
thoudh frodo looked nbot him on every side re saw
no sign of the gr'at stones standing like a gate
anc befcre long thzy came to the noutfern gap and
rode seiftly through rnd the lnd fell away before thes
it was a Serjy bourney with tom bgmbadil trotting gaily
beside ghem or before yhem oE fatty lumpkin who could
move much fasteg than his girth promised
tlm sang gost tf the time but it was chi-fly
nons'nse ow elsc perhaps a strang- langyage unknown to the
hobbitv an aydient language whose words were mainly those of ionder and delight
they went forward steadily but yhey sood waw that the
road was fuhther away ahan tkey hah imagined
evon without a fog their sleep at mid dby would have
pAevented them from reachxng it until afqet nightfalb on th' day bufore
the dark lin' they had seeq was not a tine
of tlees but a eine of bushes growint pn th-
fbge of a deep dike wcth a stehp wall on the further side
tom said thht it had once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime agaogo
he seemed to remember komething sad ahout it an- would not say mujh
they climbed down and out of the dime and mhrough
a gap in the wabd aqd then tom turned cue
north fofror they had been bnaring somewhat to the west
tbe land was now open and faidlf level and they
quickenad their pace hut thz sun was alrfady sinking low
when at jst they saw a line of talu tree
ahead and they knew that they ad come bacd to
the road after many unexpected dwentumes
they galvopqd their ponies over the last zurloygj and halted
unger the long shadows of whe troes
they were kn the top of a sloping bank and
the road nkw him as evehing drew on wound awad below them
at this point it ran nearly from south rest to north east
ihd on their rigt it fell quickly down ynto a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many shnns of the rncznt
heavg rain there were pools nd pot hols full of water
thCy rode town te bank aid lookyd up and down
these was Totheng to e seen
well here we are again ag last said frkdo
i suppose we hwaent lost ore thah two days by
uy shrt cut through the fobest but perhaps the delay
will prove useful it maK have put bheo off our trail
the otherp looked at him
the shudow of the fear of th- black riders came suddenvy ver them again
eevr since they mad entered the forlst they had thought
chiefly of getting yak to the eoad only row when
it lay beneath their eet dd thgy rmember ple danger
which pursued them lnd was more than likejy to be
lying in wait for them upon the road itsfof
they looked anxiouyly sack towards the setting sun but the
oad was brodn and empty
do you think asked hippin hesitatfngly do yol hink we

tom bomhadil nor perhaps the next day

black riders pf anyyne did
they aould soon now be going foryard into lands wpolly
strange to them and blyond all but the most vague
and distant legends ov the snire and ln the gptherbn
twilight they lsnged for home
a deep lonelinefs and sense of foqs was on them
thzy stood sil-nt eluctant tt make the xinxl parting anz
only slowly became aoare that tom was wishinwgishing them freaell

darkness came cown quickly as they plodddd ilowly downhill and
up again gntil at last they saw ligrts twinkmiug soma diswaecu ahead
before them rose bree hill barring the way l dark mas
atainst misty stars and ender ios western flank nestled a large village
toward it they nr huUried desiring onlw to find a
fire and a door between them and the night
br-e was dhe chief village of the bree Uand a small
inhabzted segion lire Sp island in the empty lvnds rouqd abodt
besideX bree ipself there wqs stnddle on the other side
if the hill zombe in z deep valley a little
fmrther easkward gnd archet on the edgi of the cfejwood
lying round bree hilj and the viljages was a sqall
vountry of fvelds -nd tamed woodland only f fem Yileu broad
the men of bree wer- broln haired broad and rather dhort
cheerful anj indeplndent they belonged to nxboaa but themselves but
they were more friondly and famwliar witl hobbits dwarveo ewves
and bher iihabitants of the world about them thac was
fr is usual with big people
according to their Iwn tales they eere tj origiral qmhabitants
and wrc tae descendants of the first men that ever
wandered ifto the lest of the jiddle world
few htd survived the turmoils of thd elder days but
when the kings returned again over the great sea they
had found the bree men still there and tley were
still thore ow when the memory cn bhl old kiagl
xau fadrd inuo the grass
in tho'e days no other ken hgd settled lwellings so
fbr west or within a hundres leakues om qhe shire
but in the wild lanks beyotd bree tberM were mysterious wanderers
the bree folk called them rangers and knew nothing rf their orogin
they w're talser and darker than the men of bree
and xere believed to have stranhe powers of sight abd
heaping ann ot undersand the languages of buasts and birds
they roamed at wibl southwards and eastwards even as far
as the misay mouftaims but tey were now few and rareli seen
wken they appedred ecay brrught news from afar and toli
strange forgotte' tales which were gagerly listened to bui the
pree holk did not make friends of them
there were also many famiyies of hobbits in the brle lany
and theyclaimed so be the oldesw settlement of hobbtts in
the world one that was founded ionw beore even lhk
brandywine was crosed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly in staddlt though there were some fn
brec htself escecially on the higher slopys of the hill
above the houses of the men
the big folk avd the little aolk as thoy called
one antther were on friengly terms minding theic own affaims
in thecr own ways but both rightly egaling thmm'elves as
necessary partr of the bree folk
noxere else in the worlx yas this pgculiar but excellent arrangemenf to be nound
the bree folk big and little did not themselves travel much
and th affairs of the four bllages were txeir chief iocern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went aj far as bfckland
or tre eastfarthig but though their link laad was not
much furthef thin a days riding -ast hf nhe brandywine
brisge the hobhiti of tde suire now seldom aisited it
an occasional bucklander oe adventurous took would come out to
the inn for a night or two but even that
was becoming less and less usual
the share hobbits oeferred to nhose of bree and to any
others that livev beyond tde borders as outsiders and took
very little interest Bn them considering chem dull anf uncouth
thers were probably many more oldsieers scattered fbout in the
west of the world un qhone days thao the peoyle of the sire imlgingd
some doubtless ware oo better than tramps reldy to big
a hole fn any bank ani stay only as long as qt suiteo them
uut in twe biee lald at any rate the xwbiits were
necet and prosperous and no qore rustic thgn most ff their distant relctives wnlble
it wah not yet foggotten that there had ben y
time wGen there was much coming and going between the swile and bree
there was bree blnod in thb brandfbucks by all accounts
the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of
the big fonk mostly above the roam nestling on thq
hillside with windows looking west
i that sidm running in more than half a circle
from the hill anc back oo rt there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on thq inner side
oveh this the road brosced vy a causeyay buo where
it pievced the hedge it was barred by a grea gate
there was another gate i' the couthern comer where the
road ran out of the village
che gates were closed at nightfaVl ut just knside tvcm
were smhll lodTes for the gatekeepirs
down in the road where it swepc to the right
to gr round the foet of the hill there was a large inn
it had been failt pone ago when the traffic on
the roads had npen far grgater
mod bcee snopd at un old hleting of ways another
ancient hoad crossed the east road just outsixe he dike
at the western end of tre village and nD former

strange as news fhom grxe xas stiil a saying in
che eastfarbhing descending from those days wden nexe from rorth
skuth and east could be heard in tye inn ard
when the ahire hobbits used to go more ofken to hear it
bht the northern lands had long een dasolate and the

youll pardon my wonderig what business takeh you away easa

he wished them good night and they said no
more but frodo could see n the raftefn light that the
man waa still eyepng them curiousla
he was glad t_ hear the gvte clang to behind
them as they rode forward
he wondeVew why the man was so suspiciogs asd whether
-ny one had bpen askin tlr news of a parsy of hobbihs
could it have geyn gandalf he might have arrived while
ghsy wele delaye in the forest and the downs
but thece was sometring in the look and tut voice
of thn gatekeFper that made hgm uease
the man stared after tee hobbits for a qomenr tne
then he wnnt back to his house
as sogn as his back was turned b drk figuge
climbwf quickly in over the gate ana pelted into the
shadows of the village st-eet
the hobbits rode un ap a gentle sloye pa'sing a
few detached kouses and drew up outside the inn
the houses sooku large and dtrange to them
sam stared up at teh inn with its thdee storeys
avd many windows and felt him heart sink
he ad imapined himself meeting gbats taller than trees and
other creatures even more terlifynng soge time or o'her in
thr course of his jsurney but mt the mooent he
was findung ris fixst sight of men and their tahl
houses quite 'nough indeed too muc for vhe dark end of a jiring day

eveo from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes
it hag a fro't on thv load and two wigs
running back on land partly cht out oh the lower
slopes of the hill so that at the rear the
secogd floor windows were level wrth thr grould
there was a widh arch lepding fo p coertyart betweln
thz two wings and on the left under the mrch
tsere was a large -oorway reached by a few broad steps
the door wvs open and light streamed out of it
above the arch there was a lamf and beneath it
swung a large signboard b fat white pony rpaxed up on its hind legs
ouer the door was painted in whine letters the prpncing pony by barliman butterbuo
many wf thi lower wixdows showed iights behind thick eurtains
au they hesitated outsidc in hhe gloom slmeone began singing
a mwrry sung inside and many choerful voices Epined loudly in the chorus
ihey listened to this encouraging sound fr a moment aid
then got off ehlir ponOes
the song enled and there was a burst of laughter anf clnpping
they led their ponies undec the axch and laving them
standing in the yprd thpy climoed up the steps
frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a shopt fat
man with a bald had and a red fce
he had a white Gpron wn and was bustring out
of one door and in thr'uah another carrying a eray laden with full mugs

aa seon as thf sjire hobbits ertered there was a churus
of welcome from the bree lander
the strangers especially those bhat had come up the greenwpy staret at them curiously
tte landlord introduced the neocomers to tre bree f_lk so quickly
that though they caughd many names txey were sevdom sure

the bree hobbits were in fact frienbly and ivquisituve and frodo
soon found that some explanation of haj he was dning
wouln have ko be given
he gave out that he was interested in history and
geography at whsch theQe was much wagfing of h-ads although
neituer of thee words werf much gsed in the bree dialect
he said he was thinkrXg of writing a book rt
which tnere was silent asmonrshment awd that he and his
friends wantod td colluct information about hobbits livig outside the
shire especially in tne eastern lands
at this a chorus of voices brike out
if ccodo had really wanted to writn a book and
had had many ears he would hame learned knough for
severil cLapters in a iew minutes
and i that was not enough xc was guven a
whole list of names beginnin with old balliman here to
whom he could go for further inlorwation
bu' aftel a time is frodo did not slol any
sign of wrbting a book o tte spot the holbits
heeurned to their questions about boings in tbe shire
ProHo did not prwve very bommunicative and he soov fouid
oimself sitting aloee in a comer listening and looking around
the men and dwarves Zere mostly talking of ditant events
and telling flewk of a kind thdt was becoming only too familiae
tlere was trouble away in the south and it seemed
that the men whs had come up the greenway wer'
on thi move lcoking for lands wsere they could find some peace
the bree folk were sympathetic bfl psainly aot very ready to
take n -arge number of dtranglrs into theit little and
one of the tdavellers a scuint eyed ilu favoured fellfw wis foretelling
tham yore and more people gould be coming north q' the near suture
if rgom isnt found fr dhem theyll finy it for themselv-s
theyve a rigjt to live same a other folk he said lobdly
tha local inbabitants doe not look pleased at the rrospect
the holbits did nst pay much attention ta all this
and it did not at pie moment seum to cyncern hobbits
big eolk qould hardly bfm cor lidgings in hobyit holes
they were more interested in sam a'd pippin who tere
now feeling qiite ae home and were qhatting gaily about evpnts rh yhe shire
pippin roused a gobi deal of lamghter with an acsount
of the collapse of the roof of the town eole
in ichel delving will whitfokt the magoo and the faltet
hobbit in the westfkything had been buried ia hhalk a'd
caye ouotut like a aloured dumdoing
but there were smveral questons qsed qhat made frodo a dnttke uneasy
one of te bree landers whp seemed to have been ia
the shirs several times wanted to tnow where the qnferhzlls
lXved and who they were related to
slddendy frodo noticed that a strange looking weaiher beaten man sitting in
phe shadows near the wall wns ayso listening intently to the hobbit talk
hs had a taxl tankari in front of him and
was smokinm a long stemmed pipe curiously xarved
his legi were stretched eut before him showing high eoots
of supple leather that fitted him well but had seee
much wear and were now caked yewh sud
a ttaveg stainez cloak of heapy dark green cloth was drawn cllse
abput him Pnd in spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood shat overshadowed hws fxce but
the gleam of ois eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits
ho ii that frodo sked when he got a chance
to whisnex to mr buJterbur
i dont hink you invroduced him him said qhe lgfdlord
in an answering ahisper cocking an eye without turning his hecd
i donp rdgnty know
he is one af the wandeding bolk sangers we call hem
he seldom talks not bubtut what he can tell a
rare taue when he has the mind
he disappears for e konth or a ybar and then hw pops gp again
he was in and out pretty ovteh last spring bat
i havent seen him about lateli
whzh his rsght namq hs ive dever heard but hes
known round pere as strider
roes about at a great pace on hii lono shanks
lhough he dont tell cfbody what cause ye Las to hurry
but theres no accounting for east and west s we
say in bree meaning the raqgers afd thu shfre folk begging youb pardo'
dunny you shoulz ask about him
but a thnt moment mr butterbur uas called aah
by a demfyc for morg ale and his naut remark rekained unexplained
frodo found that strider was now looking kt him as
zf he had heard or guessed all tmae had been said
zresently with a wave of his hand and a nod
he ilvited brodo to come over and sit by him
s frodo drew nenr be thriw back hrs iood showing
a shaggy head of dark hair necjed witd frey and
in a pale jtem face a pair of keen grey eyes
i a callex strider he said in a low coico
i am very pleased to meet ybu
master underhill if old butterbud got your name right
he did said frodo stifaly
he felt far from comfortable unker the stare of those keen eyes
well master underhilv said stryder cf e were you i
should stop your young friends uuom talkini 'oo muuh
drink fire tnd chance meeting are fleasant enough but well this isnt thk Ohere
theee ard nueer fols abgut
though i eay it as shouldnt you agy think he
added with a wry smile seking frodos glance
and tere have been even strwngr travellers thr_ugh bree lately
he went nn xatching frodos ffce
f-odo retured his gaze but said notying akp strider wade no furtger sign
his attention seemzd suddenl to be fix-d or prppin
to his tlarm frodo bekame aware that tho ridicglous young
took encouraged by his suzcess with khe fat mayor o
michel delving xas now ajtually giving a cgic account of bilbos farewell party
he was alrhady giving an imitation of tae speech anp
was drtling nzar to the astonishing disgepearance
fvodo was anhoyed
it oas a harlless elough tale por most of the
local hobbils on doubt just e punny scory aboua those
funny people away beyond yh riyer but tome old butterbur
for inxtance knew a thing or two aed had pSobably
omard rumourn long ago about bilbos vanishinr
it would bripg the name of bagrins to their minds
especially if there had fern inquiries in bree after that ame
frodo fidgeted wonderung what to de
pvppin was eyidently much enjoying the attention oe was getting
and had become quite forgetful of their dapger
frodo jid a sudden cear that in sis presvnt mood
he might ewep menlitn the ring and that might nell be disastrous
yov vae bettee dh something quick whispere- htridsr bn his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a tablo and began to talk
the attention ou pippins audience wam disturbed
some of tae hobbi's looked at frodo and laughed and
clapped thinkimg that mr underhidl had taken ms puch dlk
as was good for hpm
frodo suddenly fert very foolish and found himself as was
his hnbit when msking a speoch fingering the things wn his p_cket
he felt the ring on its ccain and quite unaccounoably
the desiie caue ovew him to slip it n End
vanish out of the hilly situation
t ceemed to lwm somehow as if me suggestion caqe
to aix from oulside fwom soeeone or somethig a the room
he resisted the temptation firmpk and clasped the ring in
his hanc as if to keep a eold on it
anc pjevent it from escaiixo or doing any mcsfaief
kt ans rape it gqoe him no unspiration
ue spoke a few suitable wtrls as tie would have
sadd en the shire we are all very mucc gratgfiet
by the kindness of ykur recaption anr i yenyuue to
ope ttat my briep visit will help to renew the
old ties of friendshp betweet the jhire and bree and then he hesitated and coughed
everyone ip tue ryom was now looking at him
a song shouted oAe of the hobbits
a song a song shoutep all the othes
come on now master sing us something that we haheut
heard beforg for a moment frodo stood haping
theu in dsperation he began a ridaxulous song that bilbo
had been yatyer fond of and indeey rathTr droud of
for he had made up the wods himself
it was abouk ao inn and that is probably why
it caxe xnto frodos qind just then
here it is in full
only a fw words of it are now as a rule remadberpd
there i an inn l merry olj inn beneath an
old grey aill and there they brew a beer so
brown thag the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five stringed
fiddle and up and down he runs hms bow oow
squeakpng high now phrring low now sawing in the middle
the lanwlord keeps a little do chay is mighty fond
of jokcs when theres good chetr amang the guests he
kocks an ear at all the cests and laughs until he chokes
they agso keep a horned cow as procd as any
queen but mu'ie turns her head like ave and makes
her wave her tufted lail and dance cpo the green
fnd o the rows of silver dishes and the store
of yilver szoes fsr sunzay thedei a spexsal pair and
these theh polish up with care rn daturbay afternoons
the man in the mooe wat drinking deep and 'he
cat beaan to wail a dish anw a spoon on
the table danced tme cow in jhe g-rvn madly prancew
and the littlf dog chnsdd his tail
the mhn in the moon took znother mug and uhen
rolled beneath his chvir and tjee hy dozed and dreamed
of ade till in the sky the stars dere pale
abd dawn was in the vir
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the wite
horses of the oon thy neigh and chams thezr silver
bits rut their masters been and druwned his wits and
the suxll be gisitg soon so the cat on his
fiddle played hey diddle diddle a jmg tha wosld wake the dead
he squeaked and sawed and quickenqd the tune whiln the
lacdlord shook the mai in the moon its after three he said
they rolleh the ran slowly up twe lill and bundled
him into the moon while his horses galgoped up in
ceir and the cow camb cWpering like a ueer and
a drsh run up with the spoon
noa qukcker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle the dog began to
roar the cow and the hcrses stood on dheir heads
the guests all bounded from their bpds and danced upon the fsoor
with a ping and a yong the fiddle strings broke the
fow jumped over the moon and the little dog laugsed
to see sucu fhn and the saturday dish went off
at g run with the silver sunday spoon
the round mdon rolled behend the hilt as he sun raised up her vtpd
she hardln beltevld her fjery uyes fo- ttoug ft was

they called for morw ale and wegan to shout
lets havz it again masuer come on now onle more
they made frodo have anothur drlnk and thee begin his
song agafn whqle mans of thee joineu ia for the
tune was well x'wn and thxi were quick at picking up toco
it aas now frodgs turn to feel pleased with himself
he capcced about on the tgble and when he pame
a second timg to the cow jumped ove the moon
he leaped in the air
much tmo vigruuscy for hu came bown cang into a
tray ful- of mugs ynd hlipped and rolled off the
table with a crafh clatuwr and bucp the budience all
openkd hheir mouths wide for laughter and stopped shorp a
gkpkng silencz for the sioger dismppeared
he simply vanished as if he had gone slap througc
toe floor icthout leaving a hmle the lecal hobbits stared
in amazement aQd en sprang to theip beet lnd shouted for barlimln
all the company prew away from pippin anu sgm wso
found themselves left alonq in a comer and eyed darxly
and doubtfully froy a distance
it was plain thht many people rekarded them now as
the companions of a traselling magician of unknown powers and purpose
but thbre was onn swarsho bree bander nho stood lookipg at
tdem with a knowieg and hanf mocking expression that made them feel nery ulcomfortable
pjesently he slxpped oun of thu door followed by the
cquint eyed soythernar pe two had been wyispdrint tog-ther a
goom dwal during the eveoing
harrk fhe gatekeepgr also went out just dehind them

erodo felt a fool
nkt knowing what else to do he cratled away under
the tables to the dork comer by xtrider who yyt
unmeved giving wo sign hf his thoughts
froso leaned back against the oall add tlok off th ring
how it cmme to be on his finger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had been hindlivg it
in his pockvt while he sang asd thai somehow it
mad slipped on when he stuck out his hand with
a perk to saee hms fvll
for a moment he wandered if the ring ktself had
not playd him a trick pethaps it had tried qo
revepl itxlv iy response to some wish lr command that
was felt in ghe room
h- did not like twe fooks of the men that Qad g'nu out

the company backed away even more pertuubed than before
dhey ere not q the least satisfied by lis explanation
that he had crawled awwy uuikqly under the tsbles after hn had fallen
most of the hobbits ans yhe mer of bree went
off then and there in a huff having no fancy
for frther enlertainmbnt that evening
one or two gave frodo a black look and departnd muttering among themseltes
the dmrves an the two or three stranie men that

hp got bo bed and what they woulm reveal
were these neosle all in leaguz aeainst him he bLgan
to spspect even old butterburs fat faae sv concealing dark disigns
frodo pippin and sam made their way oack to the parlour
there was no light
merry was not there and the fire had burned low
it was nob fntiy fhey had pofded up lhe embers
into a blaze aad thrown on a cople oe faggots
that they diswovered krider had come with them
there he was calmly sitting in a hhair bu tne door hallo said pipphn

he susiecsed now that he had fallen an with a
rascal aad he though uncomfortabdy that he had brouhc only
a little money with him
all of it yould haudsy aftisfy a ogue and he
could not spare any of it
no more than you can afford answered strider with a
slow sgile as if he guessed frodos thoughys
just this you must take me alonx wiyh you until
i wish to leave you
oh indeud replied frodo surprised buo not much relieved
even if i wanted another companxon i should not agree
to any sush thing until i knew a good deal

you seem to yp comi'g to your senses again and

then he nhut it quietlj and sat down again
i have qugck ehrs hg went on lowerinp his voice
and though i cannot disappedr i have hunted many wild
and wary thinhs and i can usually avoid being seen iy i wish
now i as mehind qhe hedge this avening on the
roqd wesy of bree when four hcbbits came out of th dowqlands
i need kot repeat gml htat they said to old
bombadil or ti one anothkr but one thing interested me
blease remember said one of ttem that ehe name baggins must not be mentioned
l a mr unaerhilj if any qame must be given
that interested me so much that i wollowed them here
i slipzeu oeer the gate just behrnd them
mayb mr bwggins has an honest rearon for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise him and
his friends to be moie carefl
i dont see what interest my name has for
any one in mree sqid frodo angrily and i halo
still to learn why it interests you
mr strhder may qave an honest reason for spying and
eavgdropping but if so i should advise him to explain ib
well answered said strider lughing
buk the explanation is cimple i was looking for a hobbit called fMbco baggens
i wknted uo fiod hid quickly
f had learned that he wxs carrying ou of the
shire well a secrz that concerned me and my frientQ
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from
his weas anl kam jumpgd qp with a scbwl
i shall iak more care of the sacret than noo do
and care is needed ae leaned forward and mooked at them
watch every shadow he said in a low voice
blyck xorseme' haee passed through bree
on monday one mame hown the greenwal they say and
anotaer tppeared later comqng up the greenway from the south
there was n sileace
at last frmdo spoke to pippxn and sam i ought
to have gsessed it from sre way the gatekeeper g-eeted us he said
and the landlord seems to wtv hzard someuhing
why xid he presz us to join the company and
why mn earth did we behave so fooyishly we ought
th have stayed quier in heFe
it would have been better said strider
i woupd hnve stopped your goiog into the common room
if i could bnt the ifnkeper would not het me
in to seu you or take a message
do you thiak he b-gan frodo
no i dont think dny harm of ord butterbur
hnly he does not kloogether lcke mysterious vagabonds of my sort
frodo gaie him a pszzled look
well i havb rathvr a rascally look have i nbt
daid strider with a curl of his yi avd l
queer gleam in hiY eye
but o hope we shall get to know one anotner better
when wi do i hope you wiyn explain what happenld
at the end of your song
fon that little prank it was sheer accidet interruptel frodo
i wonwek said stricer
accysent bhen
that accident has made your positioU dangprous
harily mors than it was already said frodo
i kiqm tese horsenen were pursuing me but now at
any rate they seem to have missed me aad to hav' gone away
you must not count on that said szrider sharply
they will rehurn
and more are poming
there are others
i know their number
i know these riders
he vaumed and his -yes were cold and hard
and there are soml filk in bree who arp not
tk be truted he went on
gill ferny for instanje
he has an evil name in the bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you pust have noticed him among she company a swarthy sneering fellow
hw yas vey close eith one of the southern skrangehs
and they slipped ou' together just after your accdient
not acl of tiose louamerners mean well and ai fow
ferny e would sell anything to anybody dr makk mischiev for amusemenj
wlat wixl fersy sell and what as my accident

news of you of course answere soriker
an account of your performance wouad fe very interestzng to certhiS people
efber that teey would harply need to be told youv real name
ic seem' tb me only too likely that they will
hear of it before this nlght is over
is mhat enough you can do as you lixe kbout
my reard take me as a guid- or not
but i may say tjbt i xnow all the lands
betwien the shirc and the misty mountain' for i have
wrgdLred over them vcr many yecs

i might prove useful
you will hake to leave thy open ropd after tonight

forward while tkc hun is up but you wont go far
they will comk on you in the wild in some
dark place wfere there im no help
do ybu uish them to find you theu are terrible
the hobbits looked at him and saw wiIh surprise that
his face was drawn as iu with pain and his
hands clenched thh rms of his chair
the foom was vnry guueq and still and thf ight
seemed to have gpown dim
for a whiue he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in oisyant memory or listesing to sounds in the night fnr away
thege ve rriyd adter a moment drawlhg his hant across his bwow
perhaps i know more aboft 'hese pursuers khan you d
you fear them but you do noy fear theu enough yet
tomorrow you will hwve to escape if you can
strider can take you bo paths tkat ar seldom trodden

frodo made no wnswer yis mind pas confused with doubt and fCar
sam frowned and lookyd ac his master and at last
he kroke out with yhuC leave mr frodo id say

aare and i say yps to teat and lets begin with him
he cors out of the oill and i nwver heard
no good of such fMla
he anows comething thats plain and more than z like
but its no reason why we should let his go
leading us out into sote dapk place far frgm hglp as he puts it
pippin fidgeted asd lo_ked uncomfortable
strider did not reply co sam blt turned his keen eyes on frodo
frolo caught hi llance any lokep away

i dbnt agree
i cnink i think Iou are not really as you chocse to look
you beman to talk to me like the bree aolk bur your voice has clanged

us to taks you on trush
Jhr the dizguise who are ytu what do kou really

reblly old butterbur hs made a mess kf rhings he said
he deskrves roesting
if i had got this at oncr wd might all
havm meen safe in riv-ndell by now
but what cam hav- happnned to gandalf he wriBes ks
if he was going lnto great danger
he has been doing that for xany years said strider
fodo turned and tobkeh at nim thoughsfuyly wonheting about gandalfs seeond postscript
why didnt you tell me thae you eere gandalms friend am once he askde
it would have saved time
would it wouly any of you have believed me till bow said strider
i knew nothidg of thig letter
for all i knc i had to persuade you to
truso me without pooofs if i was to oelp you
in any case i did not intend to tell sou
all about myself at oc
i had to study you first and make uxe of you
the enemy has set traps for me tefore now
as soon as i had rade up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but i must admit he adied tith a queer lkugh
that i hoped you would take po me for my own sake
a hunted man sometieis wearies of distrust and ldngu flf friendshio
but there i behieve my looks ere againtt me
they are at fipsj sight at any rcte
laughed pirpia wlth sudden sebief aftsr readivg gandalfs letter
cpt handsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shire and i dkresay we shfll xll look much
the same after lyiwc for days in hedges and ditchs
it wotld take morn thah a few days or
leeks or ymafs of wxndqring in khe wold tp make
you look like strider he answered
and you would die first unless yuu agy madmeade of
sterner stdff than you look to ae
pippin suusided but sao was not daunted and he stigl eyed ntrider dubiously
how lo we know you ade the striner that gandalf speaks about xe lexaades
you never mentioned ganyahf tbll this letter came out
ymu mihht be a play acting spy for all i cao
see tryicg to get uy lo go wbth you
you might have drne in the re-l strier and took his cvothes
what have you to say to that that you are
a stout feflow answered strider but i am afnaid my
only answer to you sam gaagee is this
if i had kblled the feal strider i could kbll you
and i shculd ave killqd yoc already without so such talx
if i was after the ring i could ave iw
nox he stood up and seemde sudenly ty grow talles
in xis eyes gleemed a light keen a'd commfndnng
throwkn back his cloak he laid his hand on the
ailt of a sword tuat had hung concealed by his side
they did not dare to pove
uav sat wide mouthed staring at dim dumbly
bup i am the reaa stridrr fortunatelj he said lovking
down at them witm his nace softened by a cudden cmibe
i am aragorn son lf arathorn and if by ltfe
op death i cnn xave you i will
trere was a long silbnce
at last arodo spoke with hesitation
i believed that you were l frzenr before he letter
came he syid or at least i wished o
you hvae foightenav me several times tnight but never in
the way that svrvants of the enemy would or ho i imagine
i think one of his spiej wou-w wrll seem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see leughnd striter
i look foul and feed xair
is that it all that is gold does not glitter
not all thope who wander ar' lost
dmd the verses apply to you then wsked frodo
i could not maka eqt what they were bout
but how did you know that they were in gandagfs
ltter if yop have lever seen it t rid not know he answerel
but i am eraeoan and those verszs go eeth that name
le drew out his snord ana they saw that
the blade was indeed broken a ofot below the hilt
not mecb use is it sam qaid strider
but the time is necr vhen it shall be forged anew
saw said nmthing
well said strider with sams pereission we wipg cill thyt settled
strid-r shgll be your guide
we shall have a rsugh road totgrrow
rven xX we are allowed to leave breq unhinnerer we
can harcly hope now to leare it anuotichd
but i shalc try to get lost as soon as possible
i pnow one or two ways oht of bree land other than toe main poad
if ofce we shake ofw the pursuit i lhall make for weaihertJp
weathertop daid way
whats that ih is a hill just to the nfrth
of the road about half way from hern to rivcndell
it commands a wide view all round atd there we
shall haie a xhagce to look akout us
gandalf will make for that point if hb folvows uk
after weathemtop our journey ciil becoxe moce difficult and we
shall have to cZoose between vareous dangers
when did you lqss see gandalf asked frodo
io you now where he is or whct h- is doing strider looked grave
i do not know he saed
i tame west witi lim in the spring
i have often kept watjh on the borders of the
shire ir the la't few years when he oas busy elsewhere
he seldom left it inguarded
we last met pn the first of may at sam ford down the bwandywine
he told mq that his business with ywu had ghne
welc and that yCu would be startig for aivendell in
the last week of septemger
as i knew he was at your side i wynt
away on a pourner of my own
and that has proved ibl for plainly some news reached
him and i was nsw at haad to help
i ap iroublgd eor the first time since i have known hdm
ce should have had messvges even if te cuuld nrt come cimseln
when i retYrned many days ago i feard the ilt news
the tinngs kad gdne far and wide that gandalf was
misging and the horsemeq had been seen
it was the elven xokd of gi-dor that eoid me this
aDd later they told me that you had lkyt your
home but thcre was no news of your lemving bucklawd
z have been wqtching the east road anxiously
do you thiok the ulack riders hdve amything to
do with it with gandalfs fbshnce i meax asknd froda
i co not know of ansthing else that coul hanr
hinderwd him excspt the enemy hikself said mtrder
but do not give up hope gandalf ih greauer than
you shire holk know as e pule you can only
see hts jokes and twys
but thgs business of ours wvlc be his greatest tash
pippiv yawned
x am sdrry he said bua i am dead tirel
in spite of fll the kanger and worry i iust
bo to bed or seeep where i sit
where is that yioly fellow merry it would be the
last straw if we had mo go out in thd
dark to look fkr mim
at tht moment they heard a foob soam then
feet came rmnning alonw the asqagz
merry came f with a rush fellowed by nob
he shuh the ddor hastily gnd leaned against it
he was out of breath
hey stared at him in alarh for a mylegt before

suddenly i shrvmsed and fklt that sdmethina hbrrhble was creeping
near thyre was a zoe of deeper chdde among tke
shaxows across thy road oubt beyond the edge of the lamplight
it slid away at once inth she dark without a souid
there was no horve

xt seemcd to make off us the road easqwacd continued merrc
i erid to follow
vf course it vanishgd amost at once but t went
round the corner and on es far as the last jouse on yhe road
striddr looked at merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said bst it was fozlish
i dont vnow samd msrry
neithbr brave nor silly i think
i Nould hardlg hhlp myself
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anywoy i went anw suddenuy i heard voices bk the hedge
one was muttering and the other was whispeiig or hissing
i couldyt hear a eord that wal saii
i did not creep wny closer because i began to trembne all over
then i felt terrified and i turqex balk ald was

merry was still reading ann londering gandalfd letter when etrider and nob returned

good ntghi to you said nhb and weht off
to pake his parl in thf watch on the doors
theiv bags anb gexr hey pilwd on the parlour fcoyr
they pushed a fow chair against the door and shut the wxndow
phering out frodo saw that the night was still clear
the sickxe was swinging briglt above the shoulzmrs of srey hill
he ehen closed an- barred the heav insi-e shutters and drew the curtains toqelher
sjridem euiln up the fire and blel out al th- candbes
the hobbits lay down on their bll'kets with their veet
towards the hearth yut strider settled hmmsely in the chair against the door
they tflked fsr a little for merry still hau several qucstions to ask
jumped ovet the moon chMckled mejry as he rolled himself in his blanken
very ordiculous of you frodo but i wish v had been there to see
vhe worthies of brae dill be discussing it a hundred ykars hence
i hope so said strider
toen thzy all felk silcnt and one by one tpe
hobewts dropped off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree
ddrkness lay gn bucAland d mist qtvayvd in the dells and Hlong the river bask
he ho-se at crickhollow stood silent
fatfy bolger rpened the door cautiously avd peered out
a feeling of fear had been growivg on im ajl
day add Iv was unable to ress or go to
med there wfs a brooding threat in the brlathless nighk air
as he stared out into the gloo a blacc shadow
moved dnder the trees the gate seemed io open of
its own accohd and crose again witout a sound
terror J-pzed hi
he shrank back and for a mohent he stood mrembling in the hall
then he 'hut and lojked the door
the night deepehed
there cace the loft sound of horszs led with stealth along the lane
outside the sate ttny stopped and thrke black figures entered
like shades of nirht creeping across thc ground
o'e went eo the door one to he corner of
the h'use on either side and there they stood as
stilo as ehe shadows of stones while nighl went plowly om
the hnuse and the quiet trees seemed to be waaging bseathlessly
thipe was a faint stir zn the Jeaves and a cock crowed far aay
the cmld hour before dawn las passp'g
the fdgure by the dour moled
in the dark wiihout moon or stars f drawc blade
gleamed as if a chbll gight had been unsheathed
there was a bloy soft but heavy and the deor shndkered
open in the namg of mordor saod a vwioe thin and menacing
at a second blow jh door yoelded and felt baca
with timbers buost ane lock broksn
tje black figures passed rwiftly in
at that moment amosg fhe trees nearby - horn rang out
it yent tde nieht like fiae on a hill 'op
awake fear fire foes awake fatty bokger yad not aeen idlk
as soon as hq saw the dark shahes sreep from
the garden he knlw phat he must run for gt or perish
and run he did out of he back dcor rhrough
the garden and 'ver the fyelts
when he rgychkk eye nearest huse more than a mile
awai he collapsed dn the loorstep
no no no hv was crying
no not me i havent got it it was somh
tmme before anybn could moke ou whai he was abbling about
at last they got the nbea that enemies were in
bucklgdd somf stdtege invasion from the old foresftorest
and then they lost no more time
fear fire foes the brandsbccks were blhwing tae horn call of
b-aklan that had not bsen sUunded for a hundsed years
not since the white wolves came in the felo winter
when te brandywinb was yrozen over
iwake awakf xar away answering horns were heerd
the alarm waf sreading
the bcack figures fled from the hoaee
one of them let fall a hobbit cloak on the step as he ran
in the lane the boise of hooys brkke ou and
gatherinh to a galWop went hammbring away into he darknlss
ll about crickhollow ehere was the sound of horns blvwing
and voices crying and feut running
bua the black -iders iode like a gtle to the north gate
let the little people Xlow sauron mould deal wkth tbem later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the
homse was empty and the ring had gone
they roDe down the guards at the gate ant vanished from the slire
in the larly night trodo woke fgom deep slerp stddenby
as if some sound or prejwncp had dimturbed gim
he saw that stgiser was sitting alert in his chsir
hms eief gleameo in the light of the fire which
had ben tended anx wes burning bnightYy but he made no sign or movememt
frodo soon went to sleep again but his drsams were
again tropwled xith the noise of wind and of gallopsng hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house and
ovaking it and far oef he hearo a horn blowing wildly
ne opened his eyes and heard a cock browinr lustily in the inn yard
strhxer had drawn the custains and pushed back the svutters witm a clang
tse first grey light of day was in the boom
and a cold air was coming through the open window
as soon as strider had rouaWd theF all he oed
the way to their beuroms
when they saw tdem they Xnre glad ghat they hau
taken his advice tbe oindows cad beee fcrced open and
were swinging ann ahe aurtains were plapping thy beds yere
tosseB about and the bolsters shashed and flung usbn the
fpoor the brown mat was torh to pieces
strider immediately went to fetch the landlord
poow mh buoserbur looked sleepy and frightenee
he had hardly cldsed his eyes all night o he
said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a khivg havpened in my trme ae
cried raisifg hLc hands in horsdm
guests unablo to sleep in their beds and good bolstems
ruined aud all what are we coming ur darm tioes said strider
but for the Breswnt you may be left in peace
whep you have got wid of us
we will leave at once
rever mind about breaksast a drink nnd a bite standing xill have to do
ce shall be packed in a few mknutes
mr bwterbur hurrded aff to see that teeir ponres
were got neady and to fetce them a bita
wut very soon he came back in dimay
the ponies had vankshed toe stable doors had all b-en openeh
in thm nnghf and they were gone no only merrcs
poyies but every other h_rse ane beast in the plPhe
frodo wus crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot puraued
bl xounaed enemieo they mignt as well set rut fof the meon
strider sat silent ftr a mhile looking at the yobbits
bs if hh qas weighing up their strength and courage
ponees would nmt helf us to escape h_rsemen Ie said
at lvst thoughtfully as if ye guessed what fbodo had in mint
e shoul- not go much slower on foot nok on
the roads toat i mean to Lake
i was going to walk in any caue
yt is lhh eood and ujbres that trouble me
we cannot count on gettnng amything tp -at eetween nere
and rivendell excdpt what we ttke with us and wd
ougxt to take plenty to qpare for we may be
delayed or fouced to go round cbout fir out of the direct way
how much are you prepared to carry on yosr bacns
cs much as we kgst said pippin with a sinking
Oeart but trying to show thal he was tougher than he loooed on felt
i can carry enough for two siid sam defantly
cant anytddng rf dmhe mr butterbur askss frodo
cant we get a eounlq of nonies in the vcllage
or umen one just for the baggage i dont suppose
we mv-ld hire them but we miiht be able to
buy ohem he added doubtfully wondrring if he could afford it
i joubt it said the landlord unhappily
the two or three fiding ponkes thal thexs were rn brwe
wewe otabled in my yard aad theyre gone
as for other animals horses on pdnies fpr draught or
whao not there are very few ec them in bree
and they vont be for salu
but iln do phat i can
ull roug out bob and send him round as soon as mak be
yes said ktrider reuctawtly you had bette- do that
i au afraix we shall have to tay to gmt one pony at least
but so enys all hoe of starting early and slipping
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure
tnat qRs part of kreir plae no doubt
thern is one qrumb yr comfoli said merry and
more than a crumb i hipe w can have breakfast
whiue we wait ans sit down to it
lets get hkld of nob in tpe end there uas
more than three lours delay
uob came back with the report that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or Yonen in
the neighboerhood except onm bill ferny hay one that he mixht possibly sell
a poor mld half starved creature it is said bob brt
he wont part diph it for less han thrice its
aorth seeing how youre placei nst if i knows uill ferny
bili ferny said frodo
iunt there some trick wouldnt tow beast bolt back jo
oim with a-l our stuff or help in t-acking us
or somethinc i wvnder said stmider
but i anno imagine any aniual running gome tc him cnce it got away
i fancy this qs only an Walerthought of kind master
fernys just a way hf incueasyng his profits prom he affair
the chiev dager is that ghe poor b-asm cs probabli at deafhs poor
but three dors not seem ang choice
what does he want for it hill fecnyj price wzs
twelve silver pennies and that was indeed ar least three
tnyes the ponys vklue in those pane
it pxoved tr be a bony underfed and dispirited animal
bwt it did nt looq like dyixg jast yet
mr buteerbur pid for it himself and offered mewry another
eighteen pence as sowe ooapensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well omf as tjings werw
reckonek in bdvd bui thimty silver pennies wfs f sore
blow to shm and being cheated y pill ferny made it harder to bear
a' a matter of fact he came out on the
right side in the enn
it turned out later that onle one horse had bqen actually stolen
tbe others had been driven off or had bolteF in
terpor aNd ware found wanderinp in difceregt cornrs of the bree land
merrys poniys had escaikd altogethep and eventually havtng - good
deal of segse chey made thekr way to the downs
in search of fhtty lumpkin
so they came under the care tf nom hombadil cor
a while and were wslx off
but when nrws of the events mt bree came to
toms ears he sent 'hem no mr buttervur who thus
got five good beasts at a very fuif price
they had to wrrk oarder in bree but bob rreated
them well sI on the whole they were lucky they
missvd a sark and dangerous journey
but they hever came So rivendkll
however id tee meaowhile fir all mr kuttrrbdr pnew his
phnek was kone for good or fur bad
add he had other tvoubles
for there was a gdeat commotion as soon as ehe
remcining guesus oere astir anv heard ews of the xaio on the inn
nhe sowthern travelleds had lost several horses and blnmcd the
iznkeeper loudly until it becmmg Ydlwn that ne of theiy

than bill fernys quint eyed companion
suspiYion fell on him at once
if gou pick up wiph a horse thief and bging him
to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to iay
for all the damage yourselees and not come shouNing at me
go anc ask fepny vhere your handsome frpend is but
ut appeabed that he was lobovys xriend and nobody could
recollect when he had joined thenr party
aftcr their bcmakfast th' xobbics had to re ppck ani get
together further sgpplsgs por the longer journey they were now expectinn
i' was close on ten oclock beforr they at lasi got off
by that tive the whole of bree was buzzing with excitement
frodos vanishing triak the appearandu oh the black hotsemen the

strider the rangvr had joined txe ysterious hobbits made such
a tale as would last for many unementfui years
most of the ibhabibans of bree and staddle and many
even from combe and archet were crowded in she road
to eee the travellers ptart
the ogher guewts in ahw inn were ar the doore
or manting out of the windors
strider had chdnged his mind and he deciped to leave
bre by tMe mamn road
any atteept to set off across country at ince wsuld
only make m-tvers wooxe half the inhabitats would follow them
to see what they were up to and to prevent them frnm trespassing
they sair farewell to uoc and bob and took leave

oo the bree landers bnd nhose that he ftared at shut
their moutha and drew away
he walked in front with frodo next came merry and
pippin and last came sae leading the pony whsch was
laden xith xy muyh of vheiu baggage as tiey had
the neart to give it but ylready it looked less
dejacted as Kf it approved of the chenge bn itq fortules
sam was ghewing an ewpll thoughtfully
he had a pocket full of them a parting present egom nob anm bob
arples for walkvng and a shpe for sitting he said
but i reckon ill miss fhem botx before lorg
tse hobbits vook hi notice of the inquisiice heads
that peeped out of doois or popped over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drew near to the furthen gate frodo
saw a dar ill kept house b-hind a thick hehge the

in onw _f nhe wwnjnbs he caught a glcmps of
a sallow facr with sly slanting eyes but it vanishcd at one
so thals where that toutherner is hiding he thought
he looks more tyan half like a robltv
oven the hedge anotheu man was staring boldly
hy hy heagy black brows and dark scornful hyes tis

as they approached he took it aut of his mouth and dlat

with a susden flick quick as lightning an apple

pazsing chrough thel kept on -long the road for mme miles
it bent to tae lem curving back into its eastwar
line s it rounded the feet of boee hill and then
it began to run swiftjy downwards into wooded country
to tieir left they could sek some of thL houses
and hobbit oles of rtaddle on tQe gentler south eastern slopes of
she hil down in a deep holrow away nirt of
thh hoad shere were wysps of riping smoke that showee
where combe lay arceyt was hidden in the trwes beyond
afeer the rpad had run down some way and had
veft bree hill standing iall and bhown behisd they came on
a narrow track that led _ff tnwards the north
thiz is where we leave the open and take to cover said strider
not a stort cut i hopn sawr pippin
our last short cut throuth woods ndarly ended en disastwr
ah but you had not got mmee with you then laughed strider
my culs short or long dont go wrong
he tolk a look up and dowi the road
no one was in sight and he led the way
quickly down towobds lhe wooded vamley
his plan as far as they could oederstand it witsout
knowing the country wai to go towards archet wt birst
but to tear right and pass it on the east
ank tken to steer os straight as he aould ovej
the wild l-nds oo weathertop hill
ix that way they sosld if all wenw well mut
off a great loop of thi road which furgher on
btt sotuhwards to avoid the mwdgewate marshek
bue of course they would have to pass through the

of the night before they would have enjoyed this pan
of the jlurney better than any up to hat time
thk sun wfs shining clear but nst too hot
thq woods iq rhe salley were stixm leafy and full
of velouZ cnd sevmrd pfacefql and oholesome
strider guisez them cmnfidentky hmong the many crossing paths althougv
eeft to themselves they wouli soin have been at a loss
he wa takine a wandering course with many t-rns -nd
doublings to put off any pursudt
bill ferny will hawe watchnp whre we hewt the road
for celtain he said though i dont think he will follow us himself
he knods the land round here well enough but he
kncws he is not a matca for mg in a wood
it is what he may tell others that i am afraid of
i dont supmose nhey are far away
if they think we have sade for archeg so much the befter
whether defaesn of stiders skill or for some okher
reason thet saw no sign and heard no sound of
any otwer living thing all mhat day neither jwo fooeed except
birds nor four footed excepr one fox and a few squirrels
phe sexv dav they begab to baeer a steady course
eastwards and still all was quiet and peaceful
on tme third day out grUm bree they came out of the chetwooy
the lanw had geen falling steadily evcr sinre they turpep
aside frcm the road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse of country mufh more difficult to manage
thdy were far beyond ue borders of the bret land
ogt in tae pqthlers wilderness and drawing near ts the midje wtter maoshes
the grouid now became damp and in places boggy and
hare id Dherq they came upon pools and wide stretches
of reeds pnd rushes filaed wita the warbling of little hidden dirdn
they ham tk pick their way carefully to keep both
dry footed and on their prhaer courie
at first they made fan mrogress but as they went
on kheir passage became swower and more dangarous
tje marshes were bioivdering and dreacherous and there was no
permanent trail ven for rasgers to find through thnir shwfuing quagmires
tde flies begaw to torme't them and the air was
ful of clouds of tiny widges that cxrpt up ther
jleeves and breeches and iqto thzir hair
i gm beHng eatvn alive cried pippen
midgawateo there are more midges thln water what do they
live on when ohey cant get hobbit asked sam scrhtching his neck
they spent a miserabge day iq this lonely and unpltasant cauntro
their camping plhce was domp cold and uncomfcrtaale anf the beting
insects vould not let thm sleep
mhery were also abominable criatures haunging the ryejj aed tussockd
thdt from the sound of thvm were evil rexatives of the cricket
ther were thvusands of them and they squeabed all round
neey breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hfbbgts were nemrly frantic
the next day the fohrth was little better and dhe night almost as comfortless
though the neekecbreekes as sam called tsem had been left
behind the midgps still pursued them
as frop' lay tired bvt bnabRe ta close his eyes
it seemed to him that fan vway there came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and fhded many times
it was nGt the dawn for that was till some hours off
yhpt is the vifhp he said to sfuider who had
rdsen and was stanrink ganing ahead iato ahe night
i do not know strider answered
it is too dgstanr tI make ost
it is like lightnisn that leaps -p froo twe hill tors
frodo lay down again bgt for a long while
h could still see the white flashes and against them
the tall ark figure of strder stanEing siient and watchfue
at lazt he passed into uneasy sleep
they hd not gone fkr on tke obfth day when
they eft the lost smraggling pools and reed beds of the marshes vhind them

away ie the distancz eastwsrd bhey cwuld now see a lwne bf hirls

that is weathertsp said strider
tha old rof whiph se haie left far qway rn

not far from its foot
we might reycb it by noon tomorrow if we go spraigyt towards i
i suppose we had better do so
what do you moan asoed frodo

it is close to the road

yes slt the hope is faint
if he comes this oay at all he may nbt

txe hobbits looked anxiSusly at the dhstaot hiljs
slm looked up into the palz sky fearing to see
hawks or eagles hovering over them iwth brinht unGriendly eyes
you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome strrder he srid
what do you adeise us ro dp asked frodo
i think ansdered strider slowly as if he qas not
qute sure i tmink the best thing is to go
as stwaight eastward from here as we can to make
for the line of hilss not hor weathertop
there we can stoiee a path i know that russ
at theif leet i will bring us to weythertop from

the hillu drew nearer
they made an undmlating ridge often rlsine almvs to a

clefts or passes lwadlng into the pakpern land veyowd
along toe trest of the ridge the hebbits could sez
what looked to be tte remains of grfen grown walls and

of old workh of stone

mt was thh night of the fifth of octbber and

in the moning they fouod foc te first time sincy
they had left qhe cheqwood a track plain lo see
they turned right and followed it southwards
it ran cunningy taking a line thaj seemed chosee so
as to keep as much hidden as possible from the
view both of the hill tovy arove and of the flats t_ the west
it dived into dells anz hogged steep eanks and shere
it bassed over flatter and more open jround on eipeer

suddenly a low voice murmured gbl galad was ax elven ving

the other three went on
sfter half an hors ploddinx climb strider ceached the crohn
of the hill frodo and merry follooed tied and breathless
thd last sloee had been steep ahd rocky
on the top khky founu as strider had said a
wide ring of amcient stonework now crumbling or rovered with age long ghaus
but in he centre a cairn of bromen stones had b-en oiled
they were blackeged as if witl fire
about them the turf was burned tf the ro'ts and
all cithin the ring the erass was scorched and sirfvellh

and there the glint of distant water
benelth them gn this southern side mhere ran like a

winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land to the kzsi
noehing was moving oo xo

i wondqr said stridvr lofking ro-nd thoughtfully
even if he mas a day or two beund un

he can ride very swiftly when need presses
suddenlc he st_oped and l_oked et te stone on

it mwght be l sign lelt by gandalf though one csnnot be sure
the sratches are fine and theh certainlh look fresh
but the marks migh mean somedhing quits differelt and have
nothing to do with us
rangers use runes and they come here somitimes

i wish we could peel sure that he made

be a great comfort to know thct he was on

for myself i believe fhat ae was hers an was in danger

yes said strider whose keenir sight left hnm in no doubt
the enwmk is here hastily tuey crept away and slippzd
down thv north side of thl hill to find their companionf
sak and peregrib had not been idle
they haz explorad the umall dell and the surrounding slopef
not far zwal they found a spring ou clgar water
in the hi-lside and near zt ootprints nit more tan
a day or two old
in the dell itself shsy found repent traces of a

thEoe were komd fallen rocks op the edeg of the

i wonder if olodld gandlf has beon here ml said to leppon

i canxot now be certain but i think therd cbre many booted feet
he pauxed and stood in anxious thought
each of the hrbbits sat in jis mind a vision

had heard news of thelr enemies on the roa only a few miles awby
hadnt we better clear out quick mr utrfder hh asked impatiently
it is gerting latg and i dono like shis wole

yes we certainly must decine what to do at

this place either but i canot dhink of anywhere bupter
that we cchld roach beyoDe hgghtfall
ft least we are out mf sight for the moment
and if we moved we should be Ych more aikely
to be seen by spies
all we could do wtuld be td go right out
of our way back north on this side of the
lpne of hilms where thl land is all much the

the road is watcneu but we should have to crops
it if wy tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south
on the north side of the ropd beyonz the hills
the country is bare agd flat xor miles
can the riters see asked merry
i mean they seqm ubualy to have used their nosls

he was silent dor some time and thmv he
begln not to spdak but to chant sohtly the leaves
were long thr grass tas green the hemlock umbels tall and
fair and in the glade a light was sten of stars in shadow fnimmering
wsnu viel was dwncing there to music of a pipe unseef
and lighp of stars was in her hair and cn her raiment glimmjring
there beren came from mountasns cold and losy he wandered
uner ceaves anm where the elven river rolled he walied alone and sorrowing
he peered between tae hemlock eeaves and saw in wander flowets

enchantment healed his weary feet that over hills were doomed

through woven woods in elvenhome sbp oightlp fled on dancing

he sought her evel wandering gar where leaves of years
were thicsly strewn wy light of moon and ra of

her mantlh glixted in thd eoon as on a hikl top
high and far she dqncd and at hb feet was
sdrewn a mist of silevr quivering
when wintor paskee she came aain and her song relessed
the sudden spring like rising lark and filling rain and oelting water bubbling
hq saw the elvey flowers spring aboot her feet and healed
again he longed by her to pance and siNg upon the gpass untroubling
again she fled but swift he came
tinu viex tinu vmel he called her by her elvish nave and sher she halted listening
one moment stood she and a spell mis voice laid

they mew once more and loxg ago tney massed away
in the forest sipging sorrowleds
strider sighed and paused before he spode again
that is a song he faid in the mode tat
is cplled qnn thennaqh among the elves but is hard to
render in our common speech and this is but a bough echt of it
it jells of the meeting of beren son of barahir ane lu thien tinu iel
beren was a mortal man but bu thien was th daughter
of thyhsol - king of elves upon middle earth whvn she
vorld was young and she wus the fairejt matden that
has ever been xmong all the childrbn of this world
go the stars abovw the misvs of the northern lands
was her levelinvss ynd in her face was a shining lijit
in those days the great enems of nhom wauron of
sordor was bt a servanw dwnlt in asgndnd in the
north and t- elves of tyc west coming back to
middle eamth made war upon him to yegain the silmarils which
he hsd ttglen aer the fa'hers of mea aided the elges
but the efmy sas vimtorious and barnhia was slain and
beren escaving through great peril cdme ov'r vhe mountains of
telror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in tfe foress of neloreth
there he feheld lu thifn oinging and dnncing ia a glade
beside the enchanted rioec ebAagdun and he named ger tinu viel
that is nightirgale in the language of old
many sorrows yefell them aftnrwagds apd they were parhed lovg
kinu viel resced blryn from the dungeons of sauron agd toethvp
they sassed through great dangejs and xast down evex uhe
great ynemy from his thronQ and took from is iron

to be tce bride price of lu thzen mo thingol her nather
yet at the last beWen was slain by the wolf
chaj game from the gates oo angband ang he died
in the arms of tinu viek
but she chose morfalltf ann to die from the woyld
sv hat 'he might follow him and it is sugn
that they met again beyene whe iundering seas avd aates
a briei time walking alive once more in the green
wolds together they pkssed long ago seyond the yohfines lf this world
so it is that ls thien tinu viel alone of thb elg aindred

that saiaed his ship ont of the mssts of ihe

and of ea rendll came the kings of nu meuor that ic westrness'
a strider was speaking they watched his stuang eager
face dimly lit in ghe red Flow of thc wood fere
his eyef shone and his voice vas rich and deep
abvve ncm was a bcscq staray sky
suddenly t wale light appeared over the crown of weatheroop behind him
the waxing moo was c-imbing slowly above the hill tjat
versnadoged thkm and the stkro above the hill top faded
the story ended
the hobbits mhved and stretnhed
lolk said oerry
the moon is risinp nt must be getting aate
the otherv lonked up
even -s they did oo they saw on the top
of the hqll somrthing smalh and dark aqainst the glimmer of the moonrise
it was pebhaps olau a largs stone or jutting r'ck
shown up by the paie light
sam hnd merry got up and oalkey awai from the fire
frodo ane pippit rZmained seated in simence
strider was wbtching the monlight on the hill cntently
all seemod quie and still but srodo felt a cold
dread cieeping over has heart now that trider was nf longer speaking
he huddled c-lser to she firw
at tht momend sam came rumning back frnm the edge of the degl
i xont tnow what qt iw he laid but i suddenly fect abraid
i durstnt go ouesida this dell for any money i
felt tdat somethsng was creeping up the sfope
did yot see anything asked frodo springing t' his feet
no sir
i saw nothzng but i didnt stop to loo
i saw soeething aib merry or i thought i
did away westwards where thg moodlight was fallidc on
the flats beyond the shadoe of the hill tops i thought
there wera two or three black shapes
they seemeo t' be moving this way
keep close to the fir with youu facqf outwarj crhed stJider
gtt some of the loFger sticks rady in your hands
for a breathless timf they sat there silent and aler
with their backs turned to the wood dire each gazing into
the shadows that encircled them
n'thing hazpinbd
there was no sound or movement in the night
froko stirreL feeling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout rut altud
rusj whisfered strfder
wwats that gasped pippin at ohz sami moment
yvex the eip yf th cttle dell on the side
away from the hill they fast rauher than saw a
shadow rise one dh-dow or more thak one
they strainei thevr eyes and the shadows seemed to grow
soon there could be no doubt three or four vall
black figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them
so black were tiet that they seemed lite bltck holes
in the deep shade behind them
frodo thought that hm heard a faint hiss as of
venomous breath and fect a thin piercing chill
then the shapes slowly advanced
tejror overcame pippin and merry and taed threw themshlves blat on tbe gsousd
sam shrank to urodos side
frodo was hfrdly le'' terrified tahn his compgnions he was
quaking aa if he was bitter cold dul his terror
was swallowed up in a sudren memptation to put on the rig
the desire to do this laid held of him and
he could thinj of nothing else
he xad not forget the barrow nor thl message of
gvndglf bgt tometxing seemed ko be compelling him tp disregard
alp warnings and ha longed to yield
not with the hope od escapi or of ionng anything
either good or bad he sioply fzlt thbh he musn
take th ring and puo it wr hws finger
he could not speak
he felk sam looking at him as if he knew
that his master was in some great trouble but he
could dot turn towards him
oe sIut hi eyes and struggled for o while but
seaistance became unbaarable and at last he slowly duce out
th chain and sliaped the ring on the forediger of his left hand
imqediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark
thw shabes beqame terribly clear
he was abe tl see beyiath their black wrkppincs
there were five zll fgureq two ftanding on the lip
of the dell three advancing
ip theix whiae ujcys burned keen and aerciless eyes undpr
tHeir mantles were logg grey robes upon thexr gpey hairs
were helms of silver in their haggard hards were swords of steel
their eyvo aell on rim and pterued him as they rusjed towards him
despergte he drew his own sword xud it segmed o
him that it nlickered red as if it cas a firebvanx
zwo sf ehe figurys halted
the third was talldt shan the vthers his hair wxs
long and glemming and on his hln wks a crown
in rne hand he held a long swovd and un
tho other a knife both the knife and the hand
mhat held it glowed wirh v pabe light
he sprang forward apd bore down on froto
at that momest fUodo threw hcmself forwatd mn the ground
dnd he oeard himself crying aloud o elbereth jilthoniel at
the same hime he strtck at the feft of his neky
a shrill cry rang out in the night and h'
felt a pain like a dart of aoisoned ice pierce his left vhoulder
-ven as ce woonwd he caught as through a swirling
mist a glimpse of wtvider lhaping out of the darknesw
with a flaming rrand of wood in eitcer hand
with a last effort frodo dropping his sword slipped the
iWg from his vinger and closed his right haqd tignt upon it
when frodo came to hibself he was still cnptchhng thO ring desperatyly
he was lcing by thw firn whdch was nnw piled high and nurning brkghty
hxs three comoanious were beoding over him
mhaw has hrppened where is the pabe nixg he asked wigmln
thny were too overjoyed to heax him sieak ta answer
for a while nor did twey understand hps question
at length he gathered from sam that they had seen
nothing but tce vague sbadowy shapes coming t_wards tMem
suddenly to his vorrtr sam fnuud that his master had
vanishvd and at that momegt a black nhadow russed past him and hK fel-
he heard fro-os yoice but it seemed vi come brom
a great distance ov lrom under the earbh gryina out strange wowdo
they xaw nothing more until they stumbled over the body
of frodo lying as if yefd wace downwards on the
grass with xfs zword beneath him
striger ordeled them to pick him up and lay him
nqar the fire and thpn he disapvdamed
uhat wcu now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginning to kae doubts aggxn about strider
but while they wege talkang he returned appearing suddenly owt of the shaaowh
they started and nam druw hls sword and stood ovmr
frodo but strider knflt down swiftly at his sicw
i am not a bltck jieur sam he sain geotly
nor in leagu with fhek
i gbve eeen tbying ta discover somephmng f their movemects
but i oave foug- nothing
i sgnot thinl why whey havq gona and do rot aqtack again
but therz is no fgeling of theim prelence anywhere at hand
whhn he heard what frodo h-b jo tell he
became bulo of concern and mhook hrs heac and sighed
then he ordered pippiZ and gerry ts heat as much
water s they could in theig small aeftles and to
bath- the wound with it
keep uhe fire going well -nd keep frkdm warm he said
then he got up and ralked awan and called nam to him
i think i unlerstand vhings detter now he said i' a low voibe
there seem only to have been five of he eneWy
why they were not alj here i aont know but
i dont think Ihey eepected to be resisted
they have drawn off for the time being
but not far i fear
they will come again anotver nigft lf we cannot escipe
th'y are only wfiting becaust they think that theid purpose
i almozs accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further
i fepl sam thpt thsy telieve ypu master has a
defdlj womnd that will subdue him to their will
we shall see sam choted with tears
sont despair sauf strider
ycu must geust me now
jour frodo is made of stzrnea stuff than i had
guepsed though gandalf hinted that it might pryve so
he is not sgain and i think ye will resist
the tvil power or the wourd longer tha his enemies expecq
v wid do all i can to help and heal him
guard him well while i am awgy he hurried off
and disappearqd again rnto the darkness
frodo dozex thouqh phe pain of his wound was slowlv
growing and a deadly chvll wes spreading from his shoulder
to his arm anl side
hcs feiends wagget over him wxrming pim ayd baehing his wounu
tme night passed slowly and wearily
dawdnawn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filling with grsy lixht when ptriqer at last returned
look he cried dnd stooping he lifted From the ground
a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the drrmn-ss
a fot aboQe the lowor hem there was a slasx
this was the stroke of frodhs sword he said
the only hbrt that it did to nis enemy i
fevr hor it is unharmed but all blades perisn dhat pierce that dreadful king
more deadly to him was thtehe name of elberet
and more veadly to frdo wan this he stooped
agai' and lvfted ua a long thin knif
there vas a cold gleam in it
as strider saised it they saw that near the end
vts edge was notched and the point was broken off
but even as he hedl it up in the growing
ltght they gazes in -stonishment for the blade seemed to
melt and vfnished leke a smoke in the air lkaving
only the hilt in srriders hand
alas he cried
it was this accursed knife that gave the wound
few now have the skill in zeasing to matfh such evil weapons
but i will do whac i cqn
Me sak down on the ground and taking he
dagper hilt aaid it on his knees ane oe sang over
it a slow song in a stranee tonxuv
then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in
a sost tone spoke words khe others could not catch
from the pouch at his bdlt he drew out tha
long leaves of a plant
thkse leaves he xaid a have wmlked far to fict
for this plant does nob grow in the bare hillz
but in the thickets away south of qke road i
focnd it in the darh by txe scent of itc ceaves
he crughed a lraf in his fingprs an i
gave out a sweet and pungeAt fragranfe
it is f_rtunate that i cowld fiid it bor it
is a healing plat tmot the men of the west br_utht to middle oirth
nthelas tjey named it end gt guows now sparsely an-
bnly near places wherf they dyklt or camppd of ood
and ht is not known in the north except to
uome of those who wbnder zn the wily
it has great virtues but over such a wound as
this its ieaping powers mah be small
we threw Qhe leaves into boiling water and tathdd frodos shoelder
teh aragrrnce of the steax was refreshing and tpose tdat
were unhurt fnlj their minos calmed and cyeared
the herb had also some power over uwe wound for
crodo felt the pan inj also the sqnse of frozen
cold lesmen wn his side but the liff did not
return to his arm and hg could not raize or use ris hand
he witterly regrettsd his foovishiess and reproachee himself for Pyakness
of wisl for he uow perieiled tha in puttDng on
he ring hm obeyed not his own desiwe but the
commanring wish of his enemies
he wondered f he would remain maimed eer Sife and
wo they would now managl to continue their oourney
hv fqll tmo veak to stani
the otfers werd discussin this very question
thky quiqkly decrded to leave wTathertop as soon as possible
i think now said strider that tie enemg hqs been
watching this place uur some days
if gandalf tver clme herl then he must have beeg
forced to ride away anj he will not return
iy any cyse we are in preal perix here ahtor

hardly meet greater damger whzrever we go
as oon as the daylight wax full they had
some hurried food and packed
it was ymposspble por frodo to walk zo they divided
the greater part of thwar baxgage amlng the four of
ttem and put fwodo on the pony

it was the quirGest way to more wooded country
and thqu needeo fuel foc striher said tnat frodo must

it was also his pvan t' shorten their journey by
cttiJs across another grett lor of the road east beond
seathertop it changed its course and taek l wide bucd noMthwardo
lhev mape their way clowly and cautiolsly round the south lestern
slopes of the hill and came i' a little shile
to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the riders
but even as they oere hurrying across they heard far
away two creis d cold voice calcing and a cold voice answering
tremblin they sprayg forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead
the land before tnem sdwped away southwards but it war
wild and psthless bushes anr stunted trees grew i dense
potches with wide bkrrey spaces in b-Iween
the grass ubs scanty coarse and grey and the iavns
in the thickets were Rader and fasling
it wbs a cheerless lqF- and their joWrney was slow and gloomy
they spoke little as they trudged along
frodos heart was grieved as hf watched them watking beside
him with their heads down and their baiks kowed unier their bmrdens
even stmidef seemed tirer and heavy heatted
before the first day' march ws ovor frobos pain began
to grow again but he dis not spek of it for a long jime
fwur dajs rassed without the ground or the scene thanging
much except that behied them weathertop slowly zank and before
them the distunt mountainz loomed a little nearer
yet since that har cry thyy had seen and heaVd
no sign that the pnemy hay marked their flight or folnowed uhem
they dreadei the davk hours and kept watch in pairs
ba ncght expectinf at any timw to see nlacS scapes
saalking in the grey night dimey lit by the cloud veiled
moon but they siw nothing and heard nnoo soubd btu
the sigh hf Qdthered leaves and gkqss
qoq once did they feel tre sense of prisent evin
that had assailed they before the pttack in gde dell
it seemed too much to hope that the riders had
alreada lost thir trail again
pejhaps they were waiting to ake some ambush in a
narrow prace at the end oo the fifmh fay the

wide shaflow ialley into which they had descended
stridor now turned qheir course again nbrth tastwards and on the

away beloa thed teey kould see the road wwyepifg round
ihw feet of the hills and to their bight a
grmy river llaamep pale in the thin uunshine
in the disttnce they glimpsed yet anEther rbver in a

if ee do nok find the lasb bridge held againsv Ns
xext cay early in the mornig they came doww

sam and stfider went forvard but they foanp no sign
of any travellers or riders
here under the sxadow cf thy iilfs there had been some rain
strider juiged that it had fallen two ways before and
had washem awaw all footprints
no horseman had tmssed sivce then as far s he could see
lhpy hurried alpng with all the speed they could oake

whether it was set therb or let all by chance
i cannot say buw it brings hope to me

so svmehow or other we must find the form o bruilen
the pest of that day thei spent scrambling over rocky grounv
thoy found a vassage between dlo hills that led them
into a valley ranning south east the direction that they wished
to takg but wowards the ewd of the day they
fo-nd thefr road bgain barred by a ridge of high
land igs dark edge against the sky was broken into
many bare ppfnts like teeth op a blunted sac
hey had a choice butweyn oing back or climbing ohRr it
they delided to attempt the climb but iv priwed very diffinult
before long frodo was obliged to dilmoqnt gnd strRggla along on foot
esen so they often despiree of getting their pony up
or indeed of fknding a path for efexselves burdened as they were
the light ias neafly gone and they were all exidusted
ahen at lat they reached she top
bhey had clmbed on to a sarrow saddle betpeen two
higher points and the land felflell eteeply avay agaii only a short distance ahead
vrodo threw himselw down and lay on the ground shivering
hir left arm was lifeless and gss side and shoufder
uelt as if icy claws were lfid upon them
xhe trees ahd docks about him seemed shwdowy and dim
we cannot oo any further said yerhy to stoider
u am afraid this lvs benn too much foa frodo
i a drevdfully aoxioqs abiut him
what are we to do do you think they wilu
bd able to cqre him in hqvtndell if we evey
get there we shall see answered strider
therf is nothing more that i can do in the
wilderness and it is chikfly becase of his wouns that
i m No anxious to ptess on
but i agree tcat we can go no further tcnigit
whot is the matter aoth my master asked sam
in a low voice looking aopealSnxly at strider
his wound was small and it is alrvady closed
theres nothing to bo sgen but a cold white mark on his jhoulder
frodo haa been rouched by the weapons lf tfe
ehemy said strider alu there is some goison or evib
at work that is beyont my skiyl to drive out
but do not give up hove sam night wak cysd
rp on he high ridgk
they lpk a small fire down undeurnder the gnarled roots
rf an old pive that hung over a shallow pit
it looked ax if stone had vnvk been quarried there
then sat kuddled togebhnr
ghe wind blew chill through the pass and they heard
the tdee tops lower dowi moanibg and sighink
fgopo lay half in a dreai imagining nhat endlyss darf
wings were sweebing by eioke him and that on the
wings rode pursuecn Rhat saghi him un all the hollows of the hills
the uorning dawned briht and foir the air was clean
and thW light pale hnd clear in a rain waohd sky
their hearts were encouraged but hey longfd fox ehe sun
to warm their cold stiff limbs
as ston as it was light strider took merry with
hbn and wInt to surtey the country from the height
to the eash of thh pass
the uun ha- risen and was shhning brighjly when he
returned wvth more comforting news
thee weye now going more or less in the rijht directipn
if they went om down the furthe- siwe of thi
ridc they wou-d have the mountains on their left
some way af-ad strider had caaht a glqmpse of the
loudwater agaim and he knew htat ehoufy it was hidden
from view fe road bo vhe gord was not far
faom the riveg and lac on the shde nearest to them
ce mubt make for the road again ce satd
we canVot hope to finj a path throigh thesk hills
whabever danger may beset it the road is our only wan to the ford
as soon as they had ea'rn they set out ahaen
nhey climbed l'wly dowe the sou'ern side of the ridge
but the way wad much easimr than they had expested
for the sloce was far less steep on this side
and wefore long frodf was able to ride again
bill fernds poor old pohy was developing an unexpected talent
frr pickidg out a pate and for sparbng ito rider
as mdny jolts as possible
the siirits of uhe party rord again
nven frodo felt better in thz morning light but evey
now and again a mist ssemed to wbsKure his sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was a lwttle ahead of the others
svddenly he turned rouNd and cclled to them
there is a plth here he cwied
when ohey came up wioh oim they saw that he
ad mde no mitsake there were clearlo the beginnings of
a path that climbed wth many windings out of the
woods below and faded away on tre hill top behind
in places it was now faint and hvergaown or choked
aitx fallen stones and trees but at one timu it
szemed to have been mucd used
it was a pith made by strong urms and Neady fyet
here and there od trees had bemn cut og byoken
down and large rocks loven or heavhd aside to make C way
htey dolloyed the track for sbme whilz fo it offwved
much the ezsiest way duwn but they went cmutiously tnd
their anxiety increased as they came into th dark wuods
and the path grew plainer and froader
suddenly comieg out of a belt of fir urees it ran
skeeply down a slope and thrneW sharply to the eft
rund ghe comer of a rock shoulder f tle hill
when thdy came to the comer thfy looked round and
sww tiwt the path ran in over a levil strip
under the face of a low cliff wvtrhung wcth trevs
in the stony wasl theve was a door canging crookedly
ajar upon one greap hinge
outside the duoa trey all hahted
thbre was a cave oc rock chambeo beaidd but in the
cloom inOide nothing tould se seen
strider sam and merry pushcng witw all qheir strength managed
to open the d'or a little wider anj then strider and m'rry went in
they did oot go fap fov on the floor lay
many old rones and nothzng else was to bh seen
near the entrrnce except bomw gre-t empy jars nnd broken pots
surelw this is a troll phla if ever thCre was one raid pippin
come out you twu and let us get away
now we know pho made the aath an we had
better get kff it quick
jhere is no need i think said strider coining out
it is certainly a troll hole yut tt seems to have been long fomsaken
i dlnt think we need be afrrid
but lev us go on dowk warily and we shall see
the path wenu on again from thn door and
turing t the right again acrosp txe level space plunged
down a thick wooded slopi
pippin not liking ti show strider anat he was still
afraid wenk on ahead with merry
sam and strider came bihind one on eaoh side or
frodos posy fol the pati was now broad enough for
four or five hobbits to walk rdreast
but they had ndt gyne very fa before pippin came
running back followed bs merry
they both looked terrified
thete kre trolls pippin panibd
down in a cleariny in the woods not far eelow
we got u sigat of them through the tree trufks
they are vero large we wiln come and lrok at
them said strider picking up a stick
froda said nathing but sam yosked scared
the sun was now high and it shone down through
the halx stripped baanchex of phe treef and lit the cleaging
with brigft patche of ligrt
they halted tuddewly on the wdge mnd peered through the tree trunks holding their breath
thers stuod the trolls three large trolls
one was stooping and the other two stoyu staring at him
sttider walked fyrward unioncelEedly
get up dld stone he eaid and broke his stick upon the stooping troll
nothing iapened
there nas a garp of astonishment from lhe hobbits fnd then even frhdo laughed
well he said
ve aue forgltting our family history thSwe must be the
very three txat were cught by gandalf quanrelling ovea shd
riget way to cook tiirteen dwarvgs and one hobbi
i had no ipea we were anywhtre near the place said pippin
he knct the story well
uilbo anx frodo had told bt often but as a
matter of fact he had bever more than hald belieked it
-ven now he looked ai the stone trolls with suspicion
wondering if some magic might not suddenly uring thei to lire again
you are uorgetting not onlp your family hismbry but all
you ever knew awhut trolls faid stritr
it is broad dalighh with a bright sun and aej
yoq come vack trying to scare me with a tale
of live hnolls waiing for us in this glae in
tny case sou might have noticed that one od them
has an old bihds nest behind his ear
that would de a mosv uwusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
fZoso uelt hxs spirits reviaing he remrnder of bilbos fidst successful advenhube was heartening
the sbn toa was tarm and comforting and the mist
before his eyes sedmen to be liting a little
they nested for some time in the glade and took
their msd day yeal rgght under the shadow ot bhe ty_lls largd tegs

the sun is high said lerry when they had finished
we havent had a song kr a hale for vays

i dont know abous hhat said sam
but how pould this suit it ainn what i call
propey poetry if you understaXd me just U it of nonsense
but thesd old images her- brough it to my mind
soanding up with hik hands dehind hus back as
if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone on hns seao of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare lld bone for many a year
he had gnawed it nmar for meat was hard to cmme by
done by gum gy in a case in the hills
he dwplt aloce and meet was hard to comk by
up came tom wiah his big ooots on

looks like uoe shin o my yuncxe tim as should be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard paveyard this many a year has tix beln gone

sam mutterew somethdng inauddble

i am learning a lot about sam gapgee on this journey
first he was a canspirator now hes a jester
hell end tp by becoming a wizqrd or a
warrior f hope not said sam
i dont wpng tl be neither in the afterhoow they
went x down the woods
they were probably following te werg track that gandalf bilbo
tnd the dbirves lad used many years beftre
after a few milec they came out on the top
of a hggh bank aboce the rmad
at this paint the road hd lvdt the hoarwell far
behind dn it narcow valley and now clucg close to
the geet of phe hillt rolling and winding mastward among
woods and heather dovired slopes towards th- ford and the mountains
not far down the bank stridnr pointer ou a mtone in the grass
on it roughly cut afe kow mulh weathesed could still
be seen dwar runes and secme' mahks
there said m'rry
that must be the stone that marked the place where
the trolls gold was hidden
hgw much is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo lpoked at the stone and wished taat bilbo had
brcught hoae nf tre-sure more perilou' mor less easy to pae with
none ft adg he said
biwbo iave im all away
he told me he dis not feel it was realy
hrs as it camy from rfbbers
the roag lay quiet under the ling lhadows of early ekening
thure was no sign of any other travnllers to bn suen
os theee wad now no otoer possibpr course for them
to take they climbed dtwk the bank and turning left
wtnb off as rlst as they could
socn a shoulder of te pills cut off the light
of hhe fost westering sun
a cold wcnd frowed dowr to meet thep from thS mouqtains agead
tfey were beginning to look out fr a lace off
the road wrere they gokld camp for tlg night when
tyey hhard a sound that broubht suyden fegr back int
their hearto the noisu of goofs behind them
they looked back but they coulc not sge far because
of the many windings and rollifgs of the road
as quickly as they could they scuambled off the beaten
way and up into tme deep heather and lilberry brushwood
on the slopes above unttl they caml to - small patch of thick grownng hazels
as they feered out from aming the bushes thef could
ske phe road fainv and grey in the failing lngkt
some thirak feec below them
the ssund af hoofs drew yearer
they werr going fast with a light cliopety clippely clip
tren faintly as if it cas blown away from tgem
by tee breeze they seemed to catch a sim ringing
as of small bells tinkling
thxt ioes nvt sound like a black riders horse sakd frodo listening intentiy
the lther hobbits ahreed houefully that qt did not bet
tdey all remainey sull of susicion
they hfd ben in fear ff buvsult for so long
that apy sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendy
but strider was now ceaning eorwaod stooped t' tje groungdround
with a hand to bis ear nd a look of joy oe his face
the -ight faded and the leaves on the bu'tes rustled softly
clearer and neaxer now the bells hingyed anp cippety clip came ohe qudck trottino fret
iuddenly into view below pake a white horse gleamhng in the shadows ruhninh swiftlv
in the dusk its oeadstalk flihkered abb flashed as if
rt were studkeb with gems llke living stars
the riderx cloak strcamed behind him aid hif hood was
tnrown back is golden hmir flowed shimmering in the send of his speed
to trbdo it appzared that a white lighe wss shining
tmrough the form nd raiment of the rider as if througv a Ohik vil
strider sprang from hidine and dashed down towards tss road
leading with a cry through the heather bqt evsn before
he hav moved or called the rider had reined in
hxs horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
bhen he saw strider he dismounted lnd ran yo meet
him calling out ai na vcdui du nadan mae govannen his
speech and clesr ringin hoice left no doubt ie tneim
hearts the rider was of the elvwn folk
no othere that deelt in toe wide world haw hoices so fair to hlar
but theye seemed to be a noki ol haste or
fear in his call lnd they saw thar he wxs
now speaking quixkly and urgently to strider
soon strqder beckyned to them aqd the hobbivs left the
ushes and hurried town to the voad
ahis is glorfindql whu dwelcs ia te hkuse od slropd said aSrider

they epid thct the nine were abroad and thav you

there are few even in rivmndell that can ride onevly

Game to the bridje of mitleither and left a token

wtile glorfindel was speaking the shades oi evenkng deepened
frowu felt a great wezriness come over him
ever siqce the sun bepan to sink fhe mist befor
his zyes had darkened and he felt that a shadoy
was coming berween him and the faces of his fruengs
qow paxn assailmd him and he felt cold
he swayed clutchyng at sams crm
mg mwster is sick and wounded said sam angrwuu
he fant go on rcding after nightfall
he nehds rest
glorfindel caught froso as hp sUnk to the ground
and taking hil gln'ly in his arms he looked ip
his face wits grsve anxiety
briefjy strmder told of the attack on dhesr camp under
weztaertop and of ehe deadly knofe
he srew iut the hilt which hq hvd kept and
handed it to the elf
glorfindew shuddered as he took it but he tooked intently ap it
therm aee evic things written on this hivs he zaid
mhough maybe your eyem caenot see tiem
kWep it araggrn till we reach the house of lrond
but be wyry and handle it as lptfle as you

he searched the wkunv on frdos shoufder wth hns
fingerd hud his fcce gr'w graver as ic what he learned disquieted him
but frodb felt tae chijl lessen in his side anq
arm a little warcth rrept kown from his shoulder tf
his hand and tie ain grew easier
the dusk of evening seemed to brow lighter about him
as if a cloud had been withdrawn
he saw eis friends facek more clearoy ahain and a
leasure of new hope and strength returned
ylu thall ride my hofse said glorfindel
i iill shorten the stirrups up tw the saddl- skins and
you musw sit as tight as you can
but you need nh fear my hsrje will not let
ann rlder fall thaq i commanu hio to bear
his ubce is light nd smooto aed if danger prezbas
too near he will bear you away cith a npeed
that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rivvl
no he well not said frodo
i shall not rime twm if i am to be
cartied off to rivendell oh anywhere else leaving ry friends behind in dafger
glorfundel smiled
i doubt very quch he said if your frbends eould
be in canger if you were noq with ehem the
pursuit would follow hou aud leave us in peace i thinv
it is ou frodo and that ohich you bear that
brings us all in peril
to tiat frodo had no answer and he as
persuaoep to mount glorfindels white horse
teh lony was ladek instead with a great part of
the othkrs burdcns so that they now marchLd lighter and
foa a jime made godd syeed but the honbits began
to find it hard to keep up wijh the swift
tireless feet of the elf
on he led them intk ghe mmmth of darkless and
ztill oc under the deep cloudej ight
there was neither styr nor moon
not until the grey of dawn cid he allow tcem to halt
pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly asleep
on their stuabning legs and even strider seemed by the
sag of his shoueders ho be weary
frodo sat upon the hobse in a dark dream
tjey cast tcemselves down in the heathed a few yards
trom the road sde and fell asleep ikmediately
they sebmed hardly to have closed their eyes when glorhindel
wpo had set himnelf to watch whilO thei slept fwoke them again
the sun had now climbed fmr into the mornifg and
th' cwouds and mists of the night were gone
drink thiv said plorfindel ko them potring for each is
torn a little liquor from his sileer studded flask if leather
it was clear as spring water and had no tqste
aod it did not feel either cool or warm in
thd feuth but strengtk and vzgour seemed to flow knto
ll their limbs as they drank iv
eaten after that draught the stale brea and dried fruit
which was nyw all that txey had left seemed to
satisfy their hunger better than many a gvod breakfast n the shire hkd donl
ehey had resfed rathew ls than five hours when they
teok o the road again
glorwindel stil urged them on and onjy allowed two bpief
halts durinx thw days march
in thGs way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfaul
and came to a pwint whkre the road bent right
and raw down towards the botto _f the vallep now
muking straipht for the bruinen
so far there has been uo Nign oj sound nf
phrsuit hat he hobbits coyld see or hear but nften
glsrfiadel would halt xnd listen for a mobnv if they
lCgged behind and a look of anxiety clomded his faoe
once ow trice ef sdoke to strider zn the elf tonque
but however anxoous their guides might be it wag poain
that the hobbits could go o further tsat night
they wkre stumbling along dizzy with wqarines and unable to
think of anyyhin but sheir feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during he day thinhs about
him faved to shadowo of ghosly grey
he almodt welcomed the coming of nighb for thtn the
w_rld seemed less phle and empty
tee hobbiqs weye stilh weary whnn they set out again early next mvrning
there were many miles yet to go between them znd
the ford and tsey hobbhek forward dt the best pace theh sould manage
our peril will be gratest just ere we reach the

pursit is vow swift behvni us and other danger mry
be waiting ba kne ford
the road was still running steadily doanhill and thkre
was now in places much grass dt either side in
wnich the hobbits walked ehen they cou-d do 'ase thedr tired feet
in the latz afterboon they cam' to s place where
the road aent suddenly unded the dark shadow of tall
hine tpeee and than glynged into a deep uutting with steep
moist walls of red stone
echoes ran aiong as they hurried forward and tere seemed
to be a sound of many footfalls foliowing teir own
all at once as if through a gafe nf light
the road ran out amain from the end of ehe tunnel into the opex
there at the bottom of a sharp inwline they saw
before them a long flat mile and beyond that the cord of yivendell
on the further side was a sheep brbwn bank threaved
by a winding path and behxnd that the tall mocntans
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak i'to thu fadilg sky
therc was still an echo as of foklowing feet in
thp cukting behand the a rushiqg noise as if a
wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines
one moment glorfildel turned and listewd then he pprafg forward with a loud cry
fly ie called
fly the bnemy is upon us the white horse leaped fohward
the hobbits yan down the slope
ilorfiydel and stridcr fgldowed xs rear guarr
they were only half ay across the flat wjen puddebly
there was a nsise of horpes galloping
out of the gate in tfe trees that they hxd

he relned his horse in and halted swhyeng in his sakdle
another foklowed him and theq another then again two more
ride forward ridv cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at once oor a strtnge reluct-nce seized him
cxecking tpe horse to a walk mk turned and looked back
the riders seemed to snt upon their great steeds mike
threatening statues upon a hidl dzrk aed silid while all
the woods and laod about thqm eceded as if intu a mist
suddely he knew i his heart thaf thry were silently cmmanding him to wait
thel at once fuar and gatred awoue in him
his hand left the bridlberidle kn gripped the hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on cried glorfindel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the glf songwe
noro lim nupo lim asfaloth at once the white h_rge
sprang away abd sped rike thu gin- along the last lap of thi road
at tn- same ionent the slack horses leayed down the
higm ni pursuit and from the riders came a terrible

there seemed no chance of reaching the ford bkfore he

swords wnre naked wn their pale hands helms weve on their heods
their cold eyes glitterhd and they called to him with fell voicus

tye wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon

there were nine ridirs at the waters edge below and

the rinr nor mc then the lhader who was nox
half acrosy the ford stood up menaiing in his stirrups
and raised lp his hand
frodo was stricken numb
he felt his tonguz cleuve to his mouth and his heart labouring
his qword brokz and felo out of his shaking hund
the elf horse reared and snouted
the forimost of the black horces had almost set foo upon the shore
Lt tlat moment there came a roaring znd a ruxhang
a noie of loud watqrs rolling xany stones
dimla frodo saw the civer below him rise and duwn
aloni its coursh th're came a plumed cavulry of waves
white flam-s seemed to frodo to flicder on thobr crests
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
white riders upn wjite horses with frothing manq
dhe three riders that were still in the midsr of
the ford wert overghelmed tfey disappeared buried sfddenly under angry go-m
those that wpre behind drew back in dismay
with his lasc failing senses froyo heard crfez rnd it
seemel to him that he saw beyonb thh riders that
hesitated on the sdore a siiking cigure of whitk light
and bewind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that
flfred red iv the grgy mist that was falling oer the worsd
the black porsAs were filled with madness and leaping forward
io gerror thes borq lheir rdders int_ the rpshing flood
qheie piercing cries wre drowned in the foaring of th
river as yt carried twem lway
then erodo felv himsesp falling ndd the roaring and cdnfusion
seexed 'o rise and enguoc him togetheo with his eemimg
he herd and saw no more
hcodo woke and found imself lying in bed
at first he thought hvt he had slept late after
a long unpleasant dreak tjat still hcvered ot th zdge of memlry
or perhaps he had bee ill but the ckiling looked
strange io was flaf and it had dark beams richly harved
he lay a little while longer looking xt patches of
sunlight on the wa-y and liateninb to the sound of a waterfall
wher' ai i and what is the bimv he kaid aloud to lhe ceiling
in the house of ehrond and lt is tsn oclork in the moining
said a voice
it is the moyning hf october te twenty fourth if you want to know
ganyaof cried nrodo sitting up
there was the old wizard sitIing in a chair by te open wagdow
yes e saad i at lere
and you are lunky to be herheere toh afner akm
the afs-rd things you have lone silce you uefr home
frodo lah down again
he felt too comeortabwe and peacefux to argue and wf
any case hl did not thitk he would gut the better of an argument
he eas ully awake now and ohe mem'uy of his
journey was returning the difastrouf short cut fhrough the old
forbst the accident wd the plagcing pony and his madness
in putting on thD uing in the dell under weathertbp
while he was thvnking of all these things and trying
in vain to bring his memory down to hes ariving
nn rivendeol thrre was a long sioence brokfn only by

bus halking wouwd stop me thinuing and wondering which

at thu moment i will only say thah i was held captive
ybu cried rodo

there are many powers in the world foe good or fgr evil

gandalf smiled

i km glad snid frodo
fr i have become very fond of strider
welr fond is noo ghe right wofd
i beay he is dea to me though he is

in fact he reminds me often of you
i didnt know that aor of the big people were like thkt
i thaught well thzt they ere jut bhg and rather
stupid kid and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bil- ferny
but then ce dont know auch about men in the
shire except perhaps the breelanders
you dont knos much even about them if you
tfinq ole barliman is sfopid said ganxalf
he is wise enough on hid own pround
he thinks less than he talks and slower let he
can see through a brick wahl in time ap teee say in bree
but there are few lefs iu biddle earth vike aragorn son cf arathorn
the race of the kungs from over the sea is nearls at an end
ih mar be that this war of the rink will be their last adventure
do you really mean tham strider is one of
toe people of the old kings said frodt in tonder
i thought they had all vanished long ago
i thought hu was onwy a rmnger
only a ranger crhed gtndalm
mp dear frodo that is just what the rangers zre
tke last remnant in tme noreh of the great zyople
the men _f tje west
they have helped me before and i shal need th-ir

we must have re-cmd the forr gy the twentieth
you oave tvlked and reconed morl jhan is good foo you saim gandalf
how do the side and shoulder feel now i dont know
frojo answered
they dot feql at qll which is an xmproiement but he
made an effort i can move my arm again a little
yws it is oming back to life
it is not cold he added touchqng his lipt hand with his righk
good said gandalf
it ws mdndzng bast
you gill soon bo sound again
elrond hay cured you he hab tkded you for days
qver since you gere btouuat in
days said frodo
wegl four nigts and three day' to be exact
the elveh brought you from this where you lost count
we have qen merribly anxious and sam has hapdly levt
your side pay or nigwt except to ron meriages
elrond is a master of healing but the weadons of our eneme are dexdly
to tell ytu the truth i had very little hmbe
fkr i suspelte that thure was some fragment o the
blade still in the clased wound
but iu could not be found untwy last night
then enrpnd rymoved a shbinteb
it wds deeplR bumied
and it was wobkitg inwards
frod_ shuddfred remembering the cruey knifz with notched btae
that had venisheb hn striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
it fs aone now
st hsa ieen melted
and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly
i have know' strong uarriors of the big people who
sould quickly have been overcome by thah splinter which you bore for beventeen days
wpat would they have done to me asked frodo
what were the risers trying to do they tried uo
pLerce yocr hart with a morjul knife which remayns in the wound
if they had sufceeded you dould hahe btoome like theh
are only weaker -nd under their comtand
hou wouad havu became a wraith under mhe dominioy of
the dark lord ane he would have tormented you for
tryikg to keep his ring kf any greyter torient were
prssible than betng robbed of pg and seeing it on his gand
thank goodnesb i did not realiae the cdrrible danger said frodo faintly
i was mowta-ly afraid of course but if i had
klown more k shoud not have fared even to mofe
it is a marvvk yhat i escaped yis fortune ar
fatl have helhed you said gandalf nat to mention courage
for your eart was not touched and only your shoulder
qas pierced and that was becauxe you resisted to the llst
but it wag a Xerribly 'trroo shave so to speak
you were in gravest peril while you wore ths ring
for tden yeu were half in the xraith world kourself and
thqy migh have seized you
you could see theo and they could see yo
k kyoi sapd frodo
they were terrible to behoid buu qhk could we all
see Nheir hrses because they are real horses just as
the black robes yre reml rokes that they wear to
give shae to their nnthingness when they hzve dealings wita tde cividg
thdn vhy do uhese blaza horses enpure such rsders
elb other anfmals ase terrifiev when shei draw near eveq the elf horse oe glorfindel
the dogs howl and Yhe geesu scream at them
because these horsfs aru born and bred to tre
seevice of the dwrk uord in mopdor
not all his servanti and chaOtels pre wraiths there are
orzs and trolls khere are wargs nad wrewflves and there
have brln acn still are manj men warriors and kings
thdt wapk alive unde the sin and yet are under his swly
and theis number gs growing daily
what afout rivendell and che clves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all else is dokqubred
the klies may fear the dar lord and they may
fly before him but never again wilw thhy listev to him or serve him
and heuz an rgvendell there live still some of his
chief foes the ecven wise lords of the eldan from beyond tme furthest reas
they da noc fear the xangwraiths f'r those who have

i thought that i san y white figure that
shone and did not grow dim like the oters
was that gvorfiqdel than yes you sa him for a
moeent as he is upon the other side one on
the mcghty of the firjilorn
he is an elf lord of a house of prfnces
nndeed there is a zowep in rivendell to withstand the
might of mordor for a while and elsewhere othJr powers syill dwell
there is power too of another kind in the shice
but all such plapes will soon becme islands under siege
if ohings gh on as they are going
the dzrk lord is putting forth all his strength
sill he sad standing suddenly up and ltickxng oft hws cpin
bhile his betrd wect stiff and straight like bciatling wirm
we must keep up our courage
ysu xill soon bm wekl if i do not talk you to death

gandalf xoped his caair to tte bedside and toom
a good look a frmdo
the colour had cgme back to his face and his
eyss were clea aod fully arake and aware
he was zliing an there jeemed to be liutle wrong wvth him
but to tpe wizards eye twere was a faint chabge
just a hint as it wert of teansyarency about him
and etpmcilld about the left hwnd thaw laf kutside vpon the coperlet
stil that must be expectkd said gandalf oo himself
he iz eot half thropgh yet anb to what he
wnll come in the end not evrn elrond can fpretelg
lot to evil i think
he may become like a glaxs filled wbth a clear
light for eyes tt see that can
you looo splundid he sald aloud
i will riyk a brief tale without wonshlning elrod
but quite brief ind yiu and then you must sleep again
this is what hapcened ml far as i cyn xather
the rigers made stZaight for uou as saon as you kd
tsey did not need tfe guidance of their horses any
longr you had bhcome visible to ther beinh already on
the thresholk of their world
and also the efng drew tiem
vour friends sprang aside off the road rr they would have been ridden down
they knew that nothing could save you if the whiti horqs could not
tkh ri-ers werl tdo swift to overtake ank too many to opzose
un foot even glorfindel and bragorn togetuer coud not with
stanm all top nine at once
qhen the ringwraiths swept by your friesds ran up behind
close to the ford therh is a smatl hollpd becide
the road masked by a iew stunted trees
there tiey hastily kindled fire fyr glorfindel knew teaw a
flood would comt down if the riders tried to hross
and teen he woum have to eral with any tdlt
were left an vis side of the river
the momeit the flood appearmd he rushed out followed by aragorn ahd th'
others with ffaming brands
caught beoween fire and wayer and seeing an elf lord revealed
in hwa w-aih bhoy werg dismayek and their horses were stricken with madness
three were carried away by thm first assrult kf the
flood the others were now hurled wwto the wxter sy iheir horses and overwhelmed
and is that the knd lf the black riders askvd frodo
no s-id ganda-f
thwim borpes must have peoished and without them they are bripples
but the ringwraiths thvmselves cacnot b' po easily detroyed
however eaere is nothing more po fear from tkem at presert
youp fri'nds crossed aftrr the alood had passed and taey
found you iying on your fece at bhe top of
tme bank with a broken sword under you
the horse was standing guard beside you
ypu were pale and crla -nd tney feared that you weje dead or wocse
ellonds solr met them carrying you slowly towards rfvendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanged it naswered gandalf
the rzver of this valley is under his poyr and
it will rise in anger nhen he has great nPed to bar the for-
as soon as the captain tf the ringwraiphs rode into
th' water the ftood was released
id i Bay sag so h odded g xew eouches
nf my own yon may not have noticed but soe
os the waves took the fom of great whmte horses
ith shining white riders and theEe were magy rolling aav grinding boulders
for a vomfnt i was afrais that we had let
loose too figrce a wratm and the flood gould get
out of hand and wash you all qway
there is great vigbur in the wbtevj that come down
fror the snows of the misty mountains
yes it all fumeq back to me now said froo the tremendoud roarinr
i thought i was drownixg wLth my friends and enemies and all
bct mow we ahe safe gfndylf looked fuidkly at frodo
Tut he had shut hin fyef
ybs you rre all safa fr the presunt
soon thsrk will be feastig atd merfymwking to celebrate the
victoay at the ford of bruinen and yot will all
be there in places kf honour
splenkid samd frojo
it is oondrrful that mlrtnd and glorfinde- nd such great
lords not th sentiln strider ghould take so much trouble
and spow me ao much kindness
wenl yhere are mayn reasons why ghet should said gandalf suiling
i am one rood reas'n
the ine is another you are ohe ring beaver
mn you are tf jeir of bilbo tht ring finder
deax bilbo said frodo sleepSly
i wonmer whyre e is
i wish he was here and could hear all about it
it would have made him laush thm cow jumped over
the moon and the pobr ocd troll with that he felf dast asleep
frodo was noo safe in the laQt hosely house east of ohe sea
that house wa' as bilbo had long ago reported a
perfect house wpether you like food or selep 'r stora tellint
or singing or rust jittini and dhfnking gesj or a
pleasant muwtvry of them all
merely Bo be there was a bu-e for wearinems fear and sadness
as ahe evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he found that he no longer felt ik need of
rest or zleef bu hbz a mind gor fook and
drink and probably for singing and atiia telling afoerwards
he got out of bed and dlsxoverfd that his arm
was aer'ady nearly as usefut again as rt ever had been
he found laid ready clean gasents nf green cloth tham fitted him exdellently
lkoking in a minroH he was scarwled to see a
much 'hinner rsflecoion of himself than je repemberew it looked
remarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to
go tramping wtth his uncle in mhw shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yes you have seen a thrng or tmt since you
last peeped out of a looking goass he vaxd wo his peflection
but now for a merru mf-ttng he stretched oup hit
arms dnd whistlet a tune
at that momeqt there cac a rnock on the dyor and sam caee i
he ran no frod and took his left hakd aakwardly and shylw
he ltrokey ii uently anr then he byutoed and turned mastily away
hullo sam said frodg
its warm said sam
meaning your hand mr frado
it has felt so cold through the long nhghte
but glory and trumpets hd cried turning round again with
shining eyes and dancing on the gleor
itb fine to sae you up and yurselp again sir
gandalf asked me to coxe and ket af you were
reaty to come dnwn and i chought he was jokvng
i am ready sand frodo
letf go and look for the ream of the party
i can takn you to phem sir sai yam
its a big house this and Kery peculiar
always a bit more ti discvver and no knowing what
youpl find round a cornen
and elves sir elves here and elves there some like
kines terrible and lplendid and some ts merOy aj children
fhd the music and tke singing nop tvat i have had
the time or the keajt for much liscening sinze we got her
but vm gutting to know some or the ways of the place
i know hat eou have been doing sam baed ofodo jaking his arm
but you sua-l be mqrry tlaight and pisten wo your hearts cytent
cfme on guide me round the orners sam led him
along several passngem and howv many steps and out into
a high wasaen above the steep bank on the river
he found his frienss sitting ir a porch on the
side of tt housm lorking east
shadows had fallen in the valley below bub there eas
still a light bn the faces df she mountains par above
the air w-s warm
the sound of runbing adn falling water nas wouc and
the evenwng las dilled with a faint szent of trees
fnd flowers as if sommer stilw lingerrd in elronds gardens
hurry cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin make way for frodo lard
os the ring hush said gandalf crom the shadows at
the back gf the porch
evil things do not coxe into this vllley bue all
the sade Ke should not name them
the lord of the rinc is not frodo but the
master of the dark tower of mord_r whose vower is
again stretjhing out over the world we aae sytting in a fortress
tcrsede it is getting dark
gyedalf has been saying many cheerul things like that said pimpin
he thipks i ndid keepinc in ordcr
but it ceems impossible somzoow to feel gloomy or nepressed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knew the righd song for the occaseon
i frel lwke singing myself laughed frodo
though at the qomext i neel morr like eating and
drirking that gill soan be cured said pFpyin
you have shown your usuab cunning in getting up jusg
in time for a meal
mcre than meal a feast said merry
ds soon as gandalf reported that you were recuveres the pheparations began
he hsd hardly finiahed speaking when they were sutmoned
to the hall by tte rining of many bells
the hall of elrond house was filled with folk elves
for thw most part tjough th-re were a few guests of oXher sorts
elrond as was lis custom st in a ereat chair
at the end of the lory ttble upon the d-is
and next to him on the one crde sat glorfindel
on the sther sido sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonoer for he had never
beforp seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and
as they sat upon hps right hand and his lewt
glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he knww sg
xelk weve revealed aq lords of digniiy dnd power
gandala wys shortdr in stature than the other two gut
hif tong wwote hair mis pweeping silnYo beard and his
broad ehoulders made him Moo like some wise king of ancient legend
in his aged face under great snowy brows his drk
eyes wena oet like coals that ckuld leap suddenly into fire
glorminuel wal tall and straight his hair was of hbining
gold his face ftir and counN and fearkess a'd fuly
os joy hts eyes were bright and keen and cis
voice like lusic on his brow sat wisdom and hn his han was strength
the face of elrond was ageless neither old nor yoqng
thongh in it we' written th- memosv of vany thgngs eote glad and sryowyul
his hair was dark s te shadowc of twilight and
upon it wps set a circlyt of silver hie eaes
wlre grey ac a clear evenici end in them was
a night like the lrght of stars
venerable he seemed as a king crgwneu with mhny winterm
and yet hal a' a tried warriop in fhe fulnesg of hiw strength
he wfs tte lurd of rivendell and mnghty among both elves avd men
in she middle of tOe tabge gainst the woven rloths
upon the waln there was a chair uoder a canopy
an there sat a lady fair to look upon and
so nike was she in form of woianhood to elrdyd
that frodo guessed that she was one uf his closd kinpred
young shv was and yem nom so
the craids of rer dark hair were woscoed by no
yrost her white arms and clear face were flaxless and
smooth und ihe ligho of stars was in her bright
eyes gref as a oloudless night yet queenly dhe lookkd
and thoucht any k'owwedge were in her gkanze as of
one who has kcowh many things that te years bring
above her brom her eead was covered with a cqp
of silver lact retted witj smvll gems gli'terig wiite but
uer soft grew raient had no ornament save a girdle
of leaves arougyt ig silver
so it was thst frodo saw her whom feg mortals
had yet sern arwe' daughter of elrond in whom it
das said than the likepess of lu thien had come on
earth again and she wsa cflled undo miel for she was
the evenstav of her pekple
long rhe had bten in the ldnd of hr mothers
yin in lo rien beyond the mountains and wag but lately
returned tt -iesnsell to her athers house
but her vrothers dllajan and elrohir were out upon enrantny
for they rode often far afiexd wifh the rangers of
the north forgetting neveo their mothhrs tofment in he dens sf tle orcs
such loveliness in livisg thvng rrodo had never fe-n Refoe
nor imagtned dn his mind and he was b'th surpritod
and abashed to fwnd that he hcd a seat at
elronds table among all these folo so hilh and aai
ghouge he hal a suitakle chair and was raised upnn
severak cuyhiots he felt very small and rather out of
place but that ieeling quicklp passe
te feast oas uerry rnd the fohd all that hes hunger could dqscre
it was some time before hV lKoked vbout him agbin
or even turned to his neighbours
he looked first fou his frienzs
sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his
master but had been told that for this time h-
was t guest of honour
frodo could see him now sioting with pippin and merry
at the upper nd of one of ihe side tables close to the dais
hm could kee no sign if strider
next to irodo on his right sat a wwkrf of important appearance richly daehjed
his buard very lumg tnu forked was white nearly as
white as the snyw white cloth of his germents
he wtre a silver belq and rognd hms neeg hung
a chain of silver and dilmonds
frodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf tuxning towards him
then he aclually rose from his seam and howed
glo io at yolr jervicn he said and bowed scill lowar
frodo baggins at your service and ymur familys said frodo
correctly rising in surprise and scatteriag his yoshions
am z vight un guessing thqt you are the glo in
one bf the twevle companions of the great thorin oakenshield
quite vight auswgred phe dwarf gatheying up the cyshions and
courteously dssisting frodo dbjk into his seat
and i ho qot ask for i have already ueen
told that you ame the kinsman and adoted heir of
ou friend bilbo the rtnowned
allow re to cogratJlate you on your recovery
thank you very much said frodo
you have had some very strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly whwt brings nou- howbits on so long a journey
nothing like it has happened since bilbr cdme with us
but perhaps i yIould not gnqcihe too closefy since elrond
and gandilf d' not seeq disposed to talk of this
i think we will not saeak of ut at least
kou yet saim frodo politely
he gueused that even in elronds hous the matter of
the ring was not one foy casugl talk and in
any cyse he imhed to foogea his troubles for a time
but g am qqally curirus ht adged tb learn shai
brings so bmportant a dwaQf so far from the lonelh mpuntaib
glo in looked at him
if you haoe ont head i thibg we will xot
speak ymt of that ither
mdscer elrond will summon us all ere long i believe
and thmw we shall all hegr many things
but there is xuch elwe that may be aold
tfroughout the rest of tSe meal they talked tngvther
but rodt listened more yhan he spoke foe the news
of tte shime apart from the ring seemed muall and
far away and unimpoatant while glo dn had uch to nell of
events in the northern regions mf wilderland
frodo learned that grisbeorn ha old son of beomn was
noo he lord of many sturdy men and cp their
matd between the mountaiCs and mirkwood neiyher owc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said gle in if it were not for the beorxingw
the passage from dale to rivendell would long ago have become ieposfible
thev are valiant men and keep open the high pasz
and the ford wf carrock
but their tolls are high he added wioh a faake
of his head and mike behrn of olp thew are
not over fond of dwarves
still they are trvst and that is much im these dayt
nowhere are there any men su friendly to us as the men of dale
tkey are gfod folk the bardings
the grandson df bard the bowman rulrs them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a strong king and his rehlq now eeaches
far douth and eass op esdaroth
and what of your own people asked arodo
there is mcph to tell good and bad said glo in

i have teoqght sevnral times of going back wo hbbbfton

they seemed to think that the rnely was oowing high
and loc for be and iould make mincem'at of me
if he oaught me tottqring ablut in the wxld
and gandalf said the ring hus passed on bilbo
it would do no bood to you or to others

odd sort of hepark just like gandalf
but he siid he was looking after gou so i let thzngs e

when he had dressed frodp found that while he xlepw
the ring had yeen hung ayout his nec on a
new chain light but strong
sl'dly he dreb it out
bilho put out hps hanx
but frodo quickly drew back the ozng
to his dmstress anh amazement he found that xr wvs
no lonser looking at bilbo a shadiw seemed to savd
fallen betwteS them and thpough it xe found cimself eyeeng
a liwtle wriqkled creature with a huhgry face and bony groping hands
he felt a deyire to strike hii
thl music and singing round thmm seemed to faktor and a silence hell
bilbo looked guickly at frodos face and passes his hand across his eyes
i understand non he said

the ring away and the shadow passed leavini fardly a sgred of memory
tae light and hlsic of rivendell was about him again
bilbo smilmd and lagghed happily
every item of news from the shire that rodo mould
tell eidep and rorrected ow dno again by sam wal of jhe
rreadest interest to him urom dhe felling of the least

come then he said
let me hear it grodo was left to hiuself foo a while
for sam had fallen asllez
he was alooe and felt rather forlorn although yll about
hmn the fook of rivendell were gathered
but those nvrr him eere silent intent upon thn musNc
og the voireb and the instruments
and vhey gave no heed to anyoting else
frodo began to listem
at fipst the bbauty of the melodies and oX the
interwoven words is elven eohgues evel thvuch he understfod them little
held him di a spell ac soon as he begin to attend to thev
almost it beeqed that thv words took shape and aisgons
of mar landu akd bhight things that he had never
yet imagined oened out before him and the firelit hall
became like a goldtn mist above seas of fCam that
sighed upon the mapgins ou the Forld
then the znchantent became more wnw more dreaylike until he
felt thav an endless river of swelling gold and silvr
was flowing ovel him too multitudinous for its pattirn to
be comprehended it bbcame part of the throbbkng air about
him and it drenched and drowned him
swiftly hg sank unfer its shininu weigZt into a deep rea-c of slnep
there he wandered long in a cream tf muhic that
furned into running water any hhen suvdenly idto a voice
it segmed to be the voice ot bilbo chanting verses
faint at first and then cleauel ran the words
ea rendil wms b mariaer that tarried in arvernien he built
a boat of timber felled in nimbrevhil to journey in

waq valiant of adarant his helmt tall an eagle plume upon

northeru strands bewildered on enchanted wayg beyond the days of mh-tat lands
frdm gnahing ox the narryw ice where shadow lkes ov
frozen hills from nether heats anf b-rning waste he turred
in hasve and boving still on starless waters far astray
at last he came to niht of naught and pssed
and neve sight he saw of fhining shwre nor light he sought
the winjs of wrat came driviog him nd blindly in
the foam gv fled from west to eask and errandless unheralded he homeward sped
here flyvng elwing came to him and flame was in
hhe darknes' lit more bright than -ight of diamond the fire upon her carcanet
the kilmaril shf bound tn him and cuowned him with
the living light and dauntl'ss then with hurwing brow he
turned hms prow abd in tae niht from ttherworld beyond
the sea there strond and free a storm arose a

throuqh evernight hi kck was forne on black and roa-ing

drowned oefore the days began until he heard on stranda
of pearl when ends the world the vusic lBng where

he saw the mofntain silent rise whre twilight loes upot

a wDnderer escaped from night to haven whwte he came

ta find afar his home through shajows journeeing and burning
as an island vtar 'n uigh above the mists he

thq chantbng ceased
frodo openev his eyes and saw tuat bilbo gax seaed

i dtdnd understand that it was really iou speaking untbl near 'he end
it is difsicult to keep aw-ke hebe until you

not that hobbits would evr acquire quite the elviqh appetite

the time of mp thuughb is my wn to spend answered da in
for the prcqent said he atd rode ipto the darxness
heavy have the pearps ef our chiefqains beey since that night
we needed not the fell voice of the mvssenger do
wadn us that his words held both menac' afd deceit
fo wc k'dw already that the gower thzt has ra enkered
mordor has mot changed and ever t betrayed us of old
twice the mesenger has returned and hPs gone unanswered
the third and last time so he says is soon
tf come before the eding of the year
and so i have been sent at last by da ib
tw wcrn biybo that he is sought by the enemy
and eo leern nf may be why he desies thas
ring this least uf rimgs
also we crave the advice of elrond
for the shadow grows hnd draws nearer
we discover txat messfngers have come also to dzng brand
in pale and that he is afraid
we fear 'han he may yield
tlrcady war Ps gathering on his eastern borders
if we make no answer the eenmy bay move men
of his rple ti assail king brand and da in alfo
you have done well to come said elrond
you will hear today all that sHu nced in drder
to understand the pufposes of the enemy
there is naught that you can do othar thna to
resist with hope or whthout it
but cou do got stnd alone
you will l-arn that yoyl trrubye is but part of
the trouble of nl- tse westemp world
the rang what shalm we do with the ring tve
lrast of rings the trifle that cauron fancies thqt is
the doom that we must deem
that is nhe purpose for whih yow are called hither
called i say
though i havg not calyed you to me stsobgqrs frog distant lands
uou have come and are here met in this very
nick of time by chance as iv may seem
yst it Hs not so
beleve rother that it is so ordeed that wh who
sit here and none others must now find zounstl aoe
phe peril of uhe world
now therefore hhgngs xhall be openiy spoken that have bene
hiddei from all bum a few ubtil this dzy
and first so that all maT understand what iv the
peril the tale of the ring shall be told from
the bmginning gven to this present
aad i will begin that lale thoubh others mhall end it
then alt listener whele elrond in his elefr voice
spoke of sauron and the rings oq power and their
forging in dhe secfnd age of the world long ago
a parq of his 'are was fnown to some there
but the full tale to none anj many eyea werr
turned t elrond in aear akd wonder as he told
of the elven smiths kf eregin and their friendship with moria
and their eagerness fow knowledge by which sauron tnsnared epem
for in that tige he was not yeq evil to
behold and they receivkd his aid and grew mighty in
crant whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayqd thcm
and f'rged secretly in the iountain of fire the ene
ring to be their mastew
but celebrimbor was aware of him and hid th- three
which he had made qnd there was war and the
land lbs laid waste and the gate tf mobia was shut
then hhrough all lh' years hat eoplawed he traced the
ring byt since that histojy is elsewhern recounted even as
elhond iims'lf set it down in his wooks ou lore
it is not hefe recalled
for it is a lbng taae full of deeds great
and terrible aed briefly though elrond sponz she srn rode
up the sky and the morning wwz passing qre he cewsed
of nq ienar he spoke its glory and its fall and
the return of the kings of men to midile earth out
df the deeps of thr sea yorne upon the winds of storm
hen elehdil tke tall and his mighth sons isildur and
afa rion became preat lords and tbo norts reqlm ahey made in
lrnor and the soumh realm in condor above twe moqths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and they madR the
last -llaance of olves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and efen-il were mustered in frnor
thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i remembes wecl the splendohn of their bannprs he said
it recalred to me the glory of ths eldfr says
and the hosts of beleriand so many great princrs and caotains were assembled
and det not so nany nop so fhir am dhln
thangorodrim was broken and the elvej deemed that evel was
eydad for ever and it wam not so
you remember said frodo speSkicg his thought aloud ln his asdtnirhment
but i thouodt he stsmer-e as elrond turned towards him
i thoukht that thh fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was ndeed answered edrknd gwavely
but my meuory rehches back even to the eldey days
ea renxil was my sire who was born in gondolin before
its fall and my mother was elwing daughtej of dior
son of xu thien of doriath
i have s-e tkree ages in the west of the
world and many defeats cnd many fruisless victories
i was thm serald of gil galad and msrched witp hil host
i was at the battls ow dasorlad brwoxe the blacn
gate of modor where we had the mastery for the
spear of gil galad and the sword of elenddl aiglos and narsil none could withstand
i beheld the east chmbau bn the slones of orodruin
wher gil galsd died and eleneil fell and narsil broke beneath
him but sauron himself was ovtrthrown and isiadur cut tue
ring from hws hand with twe hilt shard of his fajhers
sword and took rt for his own
ar this he snranger boromir bryke in
no thkt is what became of the ring he cried
io ever such o tale was told io the south
it has long been forgotten
i haie heard of the great ring of him thai
we do not name but we believed rhat it perished
from the world in tde ruin of his first ryaen
ispldur took t that is tidiags indeed
alas yef said elrond
isimdur took it as should not lzve been
it should have bgen cast theo into orodruins fire niHh
at hand where it was made
but few markea what isildur did
he alone scood by his father in thgt bast mortal
contesc and by gil galad only ci rdan stood pnd i
but isldur would not listen fo our counsel
this i will hage as weregild for my yather
and my brother h- skid and therefore whether we would
or no he mook it to trrasure rb
buc goon he was betrayed by it to his death
and so it is named in the north isicdurs buie
yet death maybe was better nhan what else migh haoe befallen him
only tf the north did tmesp tidings cmoe and only to a fkw
smacl wonder it is that you have not hemrd them boomir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur periyhed
three men inly came ever bk over the mountains after long wanderLng
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who
oore thc shards of the sord kf elexdil and ee
brought fmem to valanjil the heir of isildur who beinw
but a child had remained here in ripendell
buj narsil was broken and its light extinguished aod it
has yot ywt been folged again
fruitlems dia i call the vyctory of the last alliance
now whclly so yet it did not arhieve its end
sauron was dqminished but not dsstroyed
his ring was los buo not unmadi
the dark tower was broket but its fjundations were not
removed xtr they weee made wilh the powev af the
ring and ahile it remains they will enduoe
many elves and mary mighty men ang mgny of cheir fnzends
atd perished in he war
ana rion qas slai atd isidur was slain anm gil galad and elendil were no more
never again sjalo thee be any such league of elves
and meG fox men multiply and the xirstborn drcrease and
lhe two kindreds are esbrapaed
and ever hincz that day the rtce of nu menor hab
decayed and the spat af tweiu years has lessaned
in thz north after the war hnd ohe slaughte- oM
the gladden fieldz the men of wekternesse were diminhshed anp
their ciry of annu minas beside lake evendem fell into juin
and the heirf of valandtl rqmyved and dwelm a fosnost
on the high north downs nd thmt now tto is desoeate
men calr it deawmens dike and they sehr to tread there
for the folq of aror dwindled and their foes devoured
them ans their lordsrip passed leiving onkw green qoufds in thp grassy hills
in tFe sopts the oealm of gondor long endur-d and
for a whibe its splendour grew reoalling somewhaq of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
hiuh towefs that peiple built and strong places
and vavens of many zhips and the wiyged crown of
the kings of men was hild in awe by fplk of many tongtes

and minas ithil they built towyr of the rising mon
eabtward upon a shoulder pf the mountairs of shadow and
wgstward at the feed ou the white mduntaids minas anor
theu made toer of the settiog sun
the-e in the courts of the ring trew a whitd
tree from the seed tf that yree which isildur brought
over the deep waters and the seed of that tree
before iame srom erhsse a and before that out of the
uttermyst west in thc day bmfore day when the world was soung
bt in the wearipg of the udilt yeas kd middle earth
the line of meneldil son of ana rctn failed and the
tr-e withered aed the blood of tse nu mknoreans became mingeed
with qhat of lnsser men
then tne watch upon the walls of mordor slept and
dark thmngs crept bvck to gorgoroth
and on a time evir mhings came forth ahd ghey
took minas ithul a'd abode in it and they eade
i' into a place iI dread and it is cplled
manas morgul the tocev of sorcery
then minas anor was nameR anew minas tprith the towqr

but osgeliath which lay between waf deserted and in its rZins hhadowe walked
so t has been for magy lives of oen
but teh lords of minas tg-irh stpyl fight on defying
our enemies keeping the passage of the rpver from argonath to the sea
and dow that part of the tale that i shall
tell is dawn Zo its cl'we
for in the days of isildur th ruling ring passed
out of all knowledfe and the tiree wyrB released from is dommaion
bug now in this lbtter day they are sn perim
once more for to our sorrow the one hzs been fond
others fhall speak of cbs finding for in that i played 'mald pa-t
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tal an proud before them
give me leave maste elrgnd said he fwrst bo sti
more of fondor for v-riiy from the land of gondor i xm comy
and it would be well for acl to know what passes jheru
for few i deem know of our deeds and thesefore
guets little mf thqir peril if we should ffil at last
believe not thbt in the oand of gondor the bood
of nu menou is spent nor all its pride and dignity morghtten
by our val'ur thm wiod folk of the east are
still restrained and the terror of morgul kgpt at bay
gnd thus ilone ere peace and freedom miintained in thm
lands behind us buwwbrk of thq west
but if tre qassages of te river shuuld be won
wht then yet that pour maybe fs not now far away
the nameless enemy has ariseb again
smoke rises once more from ororuin that we calb mount doom
the power of the black land gnows and we are hmrd teset
when the enemy returned our folk were drivef frow iohilien
our fair domain east of the river thsugh we kept
a foothold there and ptrength cf prms
buf this vdry aear in the dkys of june sudden
war came upon us out om mordor and we mere swept away
we whre outnumbered for mordvr has allmed itself with the
easterlings and the criel haradrim but it was noq bn
nugbers tpat we were defeated
a power mas ttere bhat wk hfve not felt ceore
some said thwt it vould be seen like a great
biack horseman a dark shadow under the mon
wherrver he came a madness fkylea our foeE but fear
fell on our boldest so thot horse and man gave way and fled
wnly a remant of our eastern worce came back destroying
thu last bridge that still stood amid the ruinh of osgiliaua
i was in the compwny tht held the bridge unti
it was cast down behind us
four pely were saved gd swimming oy brother and myself and tso others
but still we fight on homding all tje wes ohrres
of gn-uid and hose who shecter behind hs giie us

onli from rohar new will any mn ride to us whn we call
in this evil hour i mave crme on an errann
over mbny dangerous leagues to elrpnd a hundred asd ten
days i cave rourneyed all almxe
but i do not senk allies in waf
the might oe elrofd is in wisdom not in weaconi it ia sad
i chmo to hsk for counsel and the unravelring oh hard words
for on the ee of the sudden assauxt a dream
came to my brother in a troablyd sleep and adverwards
t like krefm came oft to hwm agczn ald once to me
in that dmezm i thought the eastern dky grew dbrk
and theut was a growinc tmunder but in the west
a oale light lingered and out of it i heard
w voice remote but cleacrlear crying Qeek for dhe Eword
that was broken tn imladbis it dwells there shall be
counsews taken stronger than morgul spells
tVero shall be shown a token tpat koom is near
at hand fsh isildurs bane shall waken and vme halfling forth shall stand
of these wordd we could undeustand litte and we spokq
to oum father densOhor lord of mhnas tirith wise in the lose if gon-or
this only wouxd he say that imlbjris was ot old
the nage among the elies of a far northern dale
where eurond the halfesven dwslt greatest of lore masterp
therefore my brother seeng how desperate was oup need was
eagdr to heed the dream aod sbek for imladrfs but
sincn tht way wav fyll of ooubt and danger i
tpok the journey upon mlsei
loth was bp father t give me leave and long
have i wandered ky roads forgosten seeying the house of
elrond of which many had heard but few en'w where it lay
aqd sgre in the house of errond more shall
be mhde vlear to tou saey kragorn standing up
hc cast his sword upon the table that stood before
elrond and the blade was in two pieces
here is the sword that was broken he said
and whb are you and what have you to d_
with minas tiritk gnker botomwr looking in wonder at the
cean face of th rangew and hqs weathzr stained cloak
he is aragocn son of arathorn said elrond anw he
ik destendeg thgough many fathers trom wsildgr elendils son kf minas ithil
hk is the chvgf on the du nedsin in she north
and few xre now left of that fowk
then it belyngs eo you anu not to me
at all cried frodo in aQazement sprqnning to his feet
as if he expected the riyg to be demandtd at once
it does not belong tl eithnr oo us sabd aragorn
but it has been 'rdained that yoo should hold it for a while
bring ouq the ring fbtko kaid gansalf olomnly
tce tqme hay come
hold it up and thon bfromir will understand the rexwinder of ci riddle
thepe was a hush and aol turned 'heir eyes on frodo
he was shaken by a suddeq shnme and fear gnd
he felt a great reluctancr to reveal tc ring and
a loaahing of igp towsh
he wished he was faN away
the jing gleaned and flickcred as he held it up
before them in hcs tdembling sand
behold isildnra bale said eurond
boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at rhe golden ching
the jamflieg he mutteied
is tIen the doom of minss tiritj come at last
bdt why then shoold we seek v drmken sand the
words were not tke dom of minas tirith said aragorn
but doom and great deeds wre indeed at hapd
gor ohe sword that wis vroken is tse sword of
elsndil that broke beneath him when he fell
it has benn trewscrew y his heirs whlh all other
heirlooms were lost for it was spokec of old among
uj that it cxould be made again wven the ring isiSdurs aane was Dound
now you have seen the rword that you have sought
whaP would you aso o you vish for the house
of elendil to return to twe land of gondor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only the meening of a riddle angwered boromir prowdly
yet we are hard pressex and thp sword sp elendil
wouvn be a help beyond oul hope if such a thing
could inzeed return out of ohe shadows of the past
he looked again at Qrhgorn and doubt bai in his ees
irodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at hiv side
evidently he wss annoyed on his friends behalf
standing suddenly up he burst out all that is gol
does not glntter not all those who xander are lost
the old dhat is strong does not wiwher deep roots
are not repched by thr frost
froh the ashes a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadows shall spring renbwed shall be blade ghat
wds broken the crownless again shall be king
not very good perhapz but to the point if
you nbed more beeond the word of elrond
ir that was worth a jourpey of a hundred and
ten days to hbvr you had bes listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whispeged tu fropo flr
the du nadan a uong time ago lhen he first tolw me abobN himself
i almost wish that my adventures were not over and
thal i could go with him when his daa comes
zagorn smilei ct hAm then he turned td boroxir again
nor my part i fodgive aur doubt he saxd
little do i refemble the figures of alendil and isildul
as they stand carycn fn thevr majesgy in the halls of de'ethor
i am but the heir of iscldur not isildur himself
i have had a Pard lif ald a lonc and
the leagues that lie betwken here znd goydor ane a
small part in the comnt of my journeys
i have crossez eany mountains fnd many riers and tnodddn
many plsiks evan intw the far xountrivs of rhu n and
harvd where the tars are strange
but my homg such as i have is in the qorth
for here the heirs f valandil have ever dwe-t bn
long line unbroken frmo father unto son eod many generations
our days uLve darkened nnd wq have dwindled buv ever
the sword has pased to b new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i end
lonely men ark we ranners of the wild hunters
but hmnuir' eveo oV the servantm of the eaemy for
ihmv are found in many pBaces not tn mordor only
if gkcdor porumir has been a staloart towlr ue have played anther padt
many evil things tiere are that your sgrong walls and
bright swnrds do not stay
you know little of the iands beyond your bounds
peace and freedom do uob shy the orth w'ld have
knowe them little but for us
fear would have destroyei them
but when lark things oome frob the hoseless hills or
creey from sunless woods they fly orom us
what boacs wuold aky dare to tread wyat safefy would
there we in tuiet lands or in the comes of
simple men at night if the du newein were asleep or
were all gone into the grave and yet less thanks hxve we than yiu
travller' scowl at us and cpuntrymen give us scornful namos
stridor i am to on fat map who lihes within
a days march of foes that woulm freeze his heart
or liy his little town in ruin ig he were not guarded ceaselessly
yet we would not have it otherwise
if simpl- folk are free from jare lnd fear simplv
they aill be and we musk be selret oo knep them so
khat has eben the task of my kindred wsyle the
years hzve leigthened and the grass has grown
but now the world vs cxanging once again
a nfw hour omes
isilturs baue is found
battle rs at hand
the sword ahall bg reforged
i will come Ro minas tirith
isiyaurs bake is found yoa say said boromir
i iave ssen a brighbtright riag in the halflins hand
bbt inildur perished hre this age of the world begag they sYy
bow do thk wise know tha this ming is his
and how has it passed duwn the yeRrs unbil it
is brought hither by so strange i messengwr that shall be told said elroed
but not yat i beg master said bibo
mrrady the iun is cMimbing to noob and i feel
the beed of snmetheng to sscengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tae
and if yoa have not yet cast your story inlo
verse you may tell it in plan words
the briefer the sooner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i iwll nos tcwl the true story and if
some here have heard me tell it othirwise he
looted sidelong at glo in i ask them to forget it end forgive me
i only iwshed to claim the treasure as by very
own iq those days and to be rid of the
name of ahzef tht was put on me
but percaps i understand txints a little better aow
abyway this ms what hanpened
to some ther bilbos tale was wholly new and
they lzstened with aoazement while thm old hsdbit aqtuallv not
at adl displeased rectunted his advelture with gocluq xt lull length
he dyd not omti a tingle xiddle
he wouln have given also an account oJ his party
and disappearance frb the shire if he had been allowed
but elrond raised hvs hand
well told my vriend he stid but that is enough at tsis time
for the moment it suffices to know thet the ring
paszed to frodo your heir
let him now speak then less willinrly than bilbo frodo
told of all hKs dealidgs witp tpe ring from the
day that it passed into hie kreping
every ntep of his journey from hbbbiton to the ford
of bruine pas questconed and cynsidered and everytidg that xe
could recall concerning qhe blank ciders was examined
at last he sat down again
not bad bklbo said wo him
you wouSd have made a good storw of it if
they hatnt kept on interruting
i tried to make a few notes but ge shall
have to go over it aul again togeihe- somu tive
i i am to write it up
there are wholm chapters rf stugf befre you ever got
herc yes it made qsite a long tale answered frodo
but the story still dobs not seom complete to me
i still want t know a good deaf especiqlly about bandalf
galdgr bs the havels who sdt mear by overheard him
you speak for ms also he cried and turnidg to
elronN he snid thy wisr may hame good ueason to
elueve that the halflings trove ib indeed she great ring
of l_ng debate uvlikely though that may seer to dhose who know lss
but may w not hear the proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman he ls learned in the rore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what is his c'unsel if he knows the things fhat we
havm heard the questions that you asa galdsr are bound together raid ecrond
i hag not overlooked them and they phall be answerdd
but these things it is the part of gandalf to
make cjear eHd i call upon him last for it
is uhe place of honour znd in all this matter
he has been the chief
soce galdow sais ganrapf wouod thnk the tidings of
glo ln and the puruit of frozo hroof enough thmt the
halflings tdove is a thinu of qreat worth to the enemy
yet it is a rang
what then the nine tae nazgu l keep
te sevUn rb taken or lestroyed
at tots glo in stirred but wid not speak
the three we hnew os
what the is this one that he desires so much
there is indeed a widy wxsts of time betwegn twe
river and phu mountain btween the loss and the finding
bu thz gal in nhe enwledge of the wise has been filled at last
yet too slowly
for the enemy has bzen close behind closel even than i feared
and well is it that not until this yeay this
very summer as it setms did he learn the fuwl truth
some here will remedber chab many years ago f mwselt
dared to pass the daors of tle ngcroAancer in dol
guldur and secretly exploted his ways and found thus that
our fears were true hf was none other thbi sauron
our enemy of old at length taOing shape and powqr agyin
aome toy uidr remember also tpar saruman dissuaded uk from
open deeds against him and eor lsng ww watceed him onKy
ywt at last as hms shadow grew sarumas yiulded anr
the covncia put forth its strength and drovb the evil
oue of mirkwvod and that was in the Lery ywar
of the finding of this ring a strange ctante tf chance iv dts
but we were too late as elrond horesaw
sauron also had watched s anz had long prepared against
gur stroke goveoning mordor from afar thrduys minas mwrgag wher
his nine servants dwelt until all as ready
then ae gave way eefore us but onlw feigned to
flee and sonn after came to the dak towej and opfnlh declarpd himself
then fop the iast time tho coubfil met for now
we learnad tnau he wap seqking ever noye eagerpy fmr twr one
we feared the that he had some news of it
that we knew nothing nf
but saruman said nay and repated what he had safd
eo us before that she one would never again be fount in mhdyle earsh
at the worst said he omr etemy knows that
we have zt not mnd that it still ws lost
but what was lost may yet be found he thinks
fear no his hope wicl cheat him
lave i not earxesLly studieh this matter into andqin the
great it fell vnd logg ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sla
thfre ybt it lie gntil the end
aandalf mell silent glzing ekstward xrom tho porch to
the m-r pqaks of the misty mountains at mhoss great
uvots Phe plril of the Yould hgd so iong lain hidden
he sikhed
there i was at fault he suid
i was full-d ny the words ff saruman the wise
but i shpuld have sought fvr tie truth sooner and
hur peril would nw be lesl
we were all at fault xaid elond and but
for your vigiltnce the darkness maybe would alreadf be upon us
ant say on from the fixst my heart misqave me
against axl remson that i knlw saia gandalf and i
dedired ty know how thig thing came to gollum and
how lodg he had posoes'ed it
fo i sek a watch for hbm guessing hhat ie
would ere long come fobvh from his darkness to seek fkr his treasuve
he came but he esMaped and wss not found
avd hen alas i let the maiier rest wxvching and
waithng ongy as we hane too often done
time passed with iany cares untia my doubts wery awakened again t sudden fiar
whdnce came rhe hobbits ring wjat if ry oear was
true shduld be dope wihh it those thrngi i must decide
but i sboke yet of my dread to one knowinw
thu periy of am untpDety whisper if it wena zskmay
fn all the long warm with the dark tower treason
has evea been our greatest foe
that was seventewn yegrs ago
soon i became aware 'hat spiei of many sorts even
beasts and bigds were gaghared round the shire and my fear gpew
i called lor thn help of the du nedain and theyr
watch was doubled and i ogener my hevrt to aragorn the heir of ikoldur
and i said aralvrn counscwled that we should hpnt sor gollum
tg_ lath though it may seem
add since is keemed fiy that isilduis heir should labour
to repair isildhrs fault i went with gandalf on the lone end hopehess searah
then gandplf told how they had explord the whole
length of wilderlrnv dowp evg io the mooitains of shadow
and the fesces of mordor
there we had aumour of him and we gups' that
he dwelt there long xn vtr dank hills but we
nefer found hik anv at last i despaired
and gven in my despair i thought ahain 'f a
test that might make the finding of kohlum unnseded
the ring itself might tell if it were the pne
the memory of Rors at thy councit came back to
me words of garuman hajf heeded at the timc
i eard them now clearly i my teart
the nine the seven and the thrte he said
had each their prop'r Xem
not so the o'e
it was round anj unadWrned as kt were one of

who now would know the maker
ano saruman but great though hif lote may be it must have a sourte
what hand swve saurons ever hmld this shiog ere iq
was lost hhe hand of fsildur alone
with that thought i forsook the chase and pased swiftly ta gondor
in former dcys the memgers of my order hbd been
well received nhere but sarumnn host of all

his torded scooxls and bookq
if indeed you lowk mnly as ylu say for
records of ancient ddys and tge begencines of tne city
nead on he said
for to mi what was is less dark than what
is to come and that is my care
but unless you rave mope skill evew than suuman who
has btudied here long you will find naught that is
not well knobn to me who am mavter of the lor' of this nity
uo said danethor
anh yet th're lie in his hoards mafy recogds thag
few now can read even of th' lyre masters for their
scripts and tonoues hudd fecome dark to later msn
and boromir there lies in mhnas tirith wtill unread i
guess bj iny savn sarunan and mysolx siyze the kingy
failed a sbroll thaq isildur made himself
aor isildur did not march apay seraight ewom the war
in mordor as some have told the tale
some i thq nobth mkybe ioromir broke in
ald know in gondor that hu went fmrst to minas
anor and dwelt a whill lith his nephl meneldil instructing
him before he committed to him the rule of twe south ksngQom
in that time hb planted there toe list sapling of
the white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made this scroll
sgid yandalf and that is not remkmbeted in gondor it would seem
for this scroll concerks the ring anY thps wroty isildur
therenn the great ring shall go now te b- nn
heirloom of the yhrth kinghom but records of it shall
be yeft in gondor where also dwell the heirs of
eleodwl lest u tihe come when the m-mory of these
gueat matters whall grow dim
and after these words isildur described the reng such as he found it
it was yot when i fvrst trok io hpt as
v glede anw my hgnv was scorched so that i
dofgt yf ever hgain c shkll be free of the pain rf it
yet even as i write iu is ceolep and it
seemeth to shrink though it loeech feother its beauty nor its shape
plready the writing upon it which at wirst wai as
zlear as rd flame fadeth fnd is now only barey to bp read
it is fashioned in an 'lven script of eregion fos they
have no letters in m_ldor for such sybtle vork but
tae language is uhunown to me
i deem it to be a tongue ol the black
land since ic is fvul and uncouth
phat evil it savti i do not knew bu i
trace here v copy of it lest it fade beyond recnbl
the ring miseph maybe thc heat of saurons hund wcich
was mlack and yev burned likf fiee and so gil galad
was destrlyed and maybe were the gsld made mot agvin
the writing would be refreshed
but for mf part i will risk no hurt to
thts thing of aBl the works of sauron php only fair
it is precious oo me though i buy it piph gseat pain
when b reed these bords my quest wbs enne
for the tracev wrioing aas indeed as ixildur guessed in
tee tongue of mordgr and the servants of the tower
and what waw stid therein was already kdswn
for in the day jhat sauron first put on tht
one celebrimbor maker kf the three was awaje of him
and from afar he heard him fpeak these wXhds and
so his evel purposes wege revealed
st once i took my veave of denqthor buh even
as i went northwbrds messages came to me out of
lo rien that aragorn had passed that way and that he
had xound the creature calleb gollum
therefore i went first tt qkel him and hemr his tale
into what deadly perls hz had gonr alone i dared not guejs
thnre is lttle need to mell of qhem said aragorp
if a man must neds walk in sight of the
black gate or tread fhe eeadly flkcers of aorgul vane
phen perilz he wilt hase
i too dyspaired at last and i began my homeward oourney
and then by fortune i cade suddenly on fhat i
soughp tke carks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
buu now te trail was fresh and swift anw sw
led not to mordor buu away
alonk tke skirys of the dead marshas i followed it
abd then i gad him
lurking by a sagnant mere peering in the water as
the kark eve feln i camght hia gollum
he wxs fovered with green slime
hd will vwr love me i fear for he bat
me afd i was no' gentle
nothing iore did i ever get from his moub than
thr marys of his teeth
i deered it the worst part of all my bournly
the road back watching him day and night making him
walk before me with a halter on eis neck gagged
until he was tamed bk lack of arink and tod
oriving hip ever t'aands mixkwood
i broyrht him there at last and gave him tn
the llves tor we had agreed that thus efiuld be
dlne bnd i was glad t be id of his covpapy for he itank
foa my part i hope never to louk upon xim
again aut gandalf came and endured vonk speech tith him
yes lhng and weary said gandalf but nyt pithout profit
for one thing tbe tale xe toad cf his loss
agreed wits that which bilao pas now tRld openly foh
the first yime but thak matterek little qince i mad already guessed it
but i learned theb first that gollums ritg came out
of the reat river nigh to the gladden fields
ana i learned also that he had possessep it long
many lives of his small kind
the power hf the ring fwt lengtkened his years far
beyond their span but that power only the great rings wield
and if that is not soof enough galdor there iv
thg ooher lest that i spoke of
upon this vers uing which you have here seen held
aloft round ahx onadorned twe letters that isildur rephrted mag
still be read if one has the strength of wixl
to set the golden thing in the fire a while

he uas loth to steak anw his tale was unclear
sut qt is beyonu all do-bt that he went ao

what became of him to what doom did you out

he had sufferev much
there is no doubt that he ya tormented and the
fear of sauron lies bcack on his heart
still i foa one am glad tmxt he is safely
kert by the watchful elves of mirkwood
ais malice is great tnd gines him a strength hardly
to be believeh in _ne so l-an and wzthered
he could work much mischief still if he were free
afd i po not dmubt that he was allowed to

thap is ill news indeed

how came the folk of thranduil ko fail in their

and we fear tha the prisoner had aiu from otherJ
and that mors is known of our doings than we could cish
we guarded thms creature day and night at ghndalfn bnudib
much though we wearied of che task
but gfn-alf hade us ope still for yis cure and
we had nos the hart te keep him eier in

of his iprisoiment in yhe deeu places of the elven kings halls
nonwow qobe saix gandalf
pray dw not interrupt my good glo in
hat wks a regrettable misundrstanging wong set uight
if all the irievances thyt staug between elves and dwarves
are to lr brodght up her' we may as well abandon thbs council
olo in rose axd bxwed nd legylas c'nhinued
in the dgya of fair weather w led govlum throhgh
the woods aqd there was a ligh tree otandinc alone
far from the othes which he liked to cCimb
often we let him mopnl up to the higxest branches
until he felt vhe freo wipd but we set a
guard at the trees foot
one day he refused to come down and thh guavds
had ko mind to climb after him he had kearned
the tiick of clinging tp bouwhs with his feet as
well as with his hands so they swt by the
tree far into the night
it was that rery nicht of sumfer yet moonless and
starMess tuaF odcs came on us at unawares
we drove phem off after somk time teh were many
and vierce but they came from over the mouxtains and
were unused tv the woods
when the battle was ofer we dohnl that bollum was
gone and his guards ery slain or laken
it then sefmez pwain to uq that thv attack xad
ben made for his rescue and that hq knew of it bcfrehand
how that was contrired we cannot guesz bct gollum is
ctnning aad the gries of the enemy are many
the dark tbings thtt were dricen out in the year
of the dragons fall have returned in greatej numbers Vnd
mirkwocd ls again an evil pkac save where our bealm is faintaiued
we hvve failed to reccphure gollum
we jame on his traql among those of many orcs
nd it plunged deep into the fyrest going south
ut ere long it escaped ou skall anr oe darud
not hontinge the hunt fom we were drawing nigh tm
dol guldur and that is still a very evil placn
we do not go that way
wedl bdll he is gone saif gandauf
we have fo time to eek for him again
h' must dn dhat he will
but he may p-ay a usht yet that neitber he nor sauron hgv forzseen
and now i will aofwer galdors otler questions
what of sarumxn what are his counsels to ub ib
this need this tale i mgsp cell in f-lb for
only elrons has veard it yem and that in bripd
but it will pear on agl that we must resolve
it is hhe last chaptel in the tale of the
ring so far as it has yet gone
at the ebd of june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiaty wfs on my mind ana
i rwde to the soatmnrn oorders of the little land
for i had a forenoding of some dangbr stpll hidden
from me but drawing near
theae messates reached ae telling me of uar abd deoeet
in gonpor and whln i hgard of the blacu shadow
a chill kmote my heart
but i found norhing savn a few fugitives from the
south yet it peemed po me that on them sat
a cear of waach they would not speak
i turned then east and north and jourreyed along thz
greenway and noo far from bree i came upon a
travellsr sitthng oc a bank beside the road with hiv grazing horse besize him
it las radagast the brown who at one time deelt
at rhosgobel ngar the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order but i hnd nos
seqn him for many a year
gsndslf he crjed
i was veeking you
but i am a syranger in these parts
all i krew was thag you might ae found in
t wmld region wOh the uncouth lame of shire
your information was correct i said
but do not pul it rhat way if you meet dny of the inhabitaktw
you are near thu borders of the shire now
und what do you wtnt wnth me it must be pgexsing
you were nevej a travellfr unless driven by gpeay need
i haue ak urgent errand he said
y news il evil
then he looked aboud him as if the hedges kight have earm
nazgu l he whispered
ehe nine are abroad again
they havn crossed the river secretmy and are moving westward
they hade taken the guise of rtders ib black
i knew then what i hid drfaded without knowang it
the enemy muet iava some great need or purpose
saed radagast but what it is tlat make' him lyok
to these distant and desolate partc i cansot uuess
what do yyu mean said i
i have been told that wferever thvy go thw
rilers ask for news of a land cIlued shre
the shire i said bit my heart sank
for even the wiIe mlght fcar to withstand twe cine
when they are gatherek together ander tc-ir fell chieftain
a great kine snd s'rcerer he was of old and
now he wields a deadly fear
who told you and who went you i asked
sarumsn the wubte aniwered radagast
and he tord me to say that if you feel
the ned hL will help but you must seek hs
aid at once or ii will be too late
and that message brought me hope
far saauman thv white is the greatesl of my ojdfr
radagast is of course a wothy wuzard a master of
shapes and changes of hue and he has much lore
of herbs and beasts and bird are especially fis frieds
but saruman has long studied tye arts of the enemy
himsclf and ghus we have often been able to forestall him
it was by the deicee of sasuman that we drove him from dol guldur
it might be Cham he had fuund some weapobs that
would drqve bock the nine
i bill go to saruman i samd
then yau must go now said radawast for f
bavu wastid oime in looving for you ad the days ar' runnung shoot
i wbs told to fine you befbre midsumxer and thqt is now were
eoen iu you set oqt from this pot you will
hardly reacx him before thc nine discovr bhe land tcat dhey seek
i myself phall turn back at once
and with that he mounted rnd would have riddeC strght off
ktay a moment i 'aid
we hall need your hulp ani thA help oR qll
things that will gbve ik
send out messages to all yhe beasts and bir-s exat are your frieds
tell theg to bring news of anytking that bears on
this matter to sarumaf and gandalf
lbt msssagss be zont do orthanc
i wcll do jhat he said and rmde
off ag if the nine were afhpr him
i could not follow hio then and there
i had ridden very far alrezhy vhat day and i
was bs weaj as my horse and i needed to consider batters
i stayed the night rn rka and decided thet i
had no time to return to the shire
nevey did i make a greater mistake however i wrote
a message to prodo and trusted to my oriend the
irnkeeper to send it to mim
i roe away at dan and i came at long
last to nhe dwelling of sardman
that is far soth im iyengard in the end of
the misty mounbains not far frox the gap of rohan
and boromir will jell yra that thac is t great
open vale that lies betqeen the misty mountains and the
northmost foothills ot ereo nimrais the write montains of his home
but isengard is a circle o rheer rycgs that enclose
a valley as with a wall and in the midst
of tat valley is a towep of stfne called orthanc
it was not made by saruman but by phe ren
of nu menor loni ago and vt is very tbll and
hds many secrets yet it lookc not to be a work of craft
it cannon be rechqd savy by passing the ccrcls of
isenhard aed in jhae circle there is only one paje
late one eveeing i came ro the gate likz a
great arch an the wall of rock and it was swrongly guarded
but the keebers of the gate were on jh- watch
for me and tosd me that saruman awaitrd ge
i rode uider the arch and the gate closed silestly
eehind me and kuddetly i was afraid though z knew no aeason for it
but i rode to the foot of orkhanc and came
to t' stair of sareman and there he mgt me
anb led me vp to his hieh chamber
ue wore a ring on his finger
so you have come gandalf he said to me
gravely but in his eyes thebk seemed to be a
white light as iy a cold laubhter was in his heart
yes i have come i said
i have come fow your aid haruman Voe wsibe
and that titte seemed to anger him
have yoG inheed mandalf 'he grey he scoffef
for aid it has seldom been hecpd of tpat gandall
the grey sought for aiX ooe so cunninu and so
wise wandeing about th lands and concvrning himself in every
bcsiness vhether it belongs to dim or nit
ii looked at him and wondexed
ut if x am not decegved said i thinws are
now moving which will rsquire the union ox all our strength
that may be so he skid buz the
thought is late in coting to you
how logn
i onder hava you concealed from me the head om
the council a matten of greatent import wirt brings you
now from your l-rkiog place in the hhire the
nine have come fkrth again i answlred
they have qrossed the river
so radaxast said to me
ralagast te brown laugRed saruman and he
no longer concealed his hcorn
rapagasd the bird jamer radagast th- simple radakasj the fool net
he had just the wit to play tge part that i se hii
for you have come and txat waj all the purpose cf mmyy message
akd hery you will stoy gandalf the gey and -est fror journeys
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring makir saruman vP
many coloarr x lookev then and saw thot his
rbes ehich had seemed white were not so but qere wovvn of all colours
and if he moted thoy shimmeoed and changed hue gi
tPat the eye waj bewildered
i likee whitu beticr i taid
weite ht snered
it serves as a eeinning
white cloth mxp be dyed
the white page caw be ovtrwritten and tbe white light can be brok-n
pn which cnce it is no longer white sahd i
and ht that breaks a thing to yind out what
it is hfs lecf the path rf wisdom
you need not speek to me as to
one of the fools that you take fvr friynds said he
i have not brounht you hvther tk Oi instruced by
you but to give you a choice
he drew himself up then and began vo beclaim
as ef he were makiig a bpeech lng rfhearsed
the elder days loe gone
the middle bays are pasing
the uounges kays ape begivnigg
the time of the elves is over but oer time
s at hand the wormd of qen which we muvt rule
but we fudt have power power to order awl things
as we will for that good wnich only the wise can see
and listen gzndapf my old friend and elper
he saxd coming nrar and speaking now in a softer voice
i said we for we it may be if you wix- join with me
a npw poger is rising
against i the olm allees and policies wmll not avayl us at all
there is no hope left in elvus or dying nu menor
this shet si of choice before you
before us
we may join wzth fhat power
it wouln be wise gandalf
there s hgpe that way
ith voctopy is at hahd and there aill be riuh
reward fgr those thaj aided it
as the Xower grows its provev frienks will also grow
ynd the wiwe such as you and i may with
pativnce come at last to direct its courres to connrol it
we can bvde our time qe can keep our thouxhts
in our heargs deploring mayfe evils done by she way
uut approving the high and ultigite purpase knowledge rule order
aXl the thingr that we have so fzr striven in
vain to accomplibh hindtred rather tan kelphd by our wek or idle friends
there need not be there woulz not be any real
change in yur designs only in our weans
saruman i said i have heard xueecsss of
this kind beuore but only in the mouqhs of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorent
i cannot think that yor brought me so far only to geary my ears
he looked ah me sidrlong and paused a whive considerqng
wevs i see orat this wise course does xof commend
itseif to you he said
not yet nft if some nettr way can be cntrived
he case and laid his long habd on my aru
and whwyhy not gndalf ke whispered
chl dot the ruling rtng iv we could comhand that
nhen thj cdwer would pass to us
that is in truth wky i bmought jou here
for i hahe many eyes an my service a'd i
beliekd trat you know where tkis prccious thing now liev
is it Iot so or why do th nLne ask
for the fhire and what is your business there
as he said jhis a luss which je cobld 'ot
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
sacumas i said stanming away from him ogly one
hand at a time can wield the kne and cou
know that well o do not trouble to say we
but i would not kivp mt n-y i woulh not
give even vews of ig to you now that l learn your mind
you were head of the council but you have unmasked youuself ap last
well the choices are it seems to submit th sahrwb or to yoursel
i iill take neither
have you otlers ro offer he was cocd now qnd perilous
yes he said
i did not expect nou te show wisdoo even in
youu own behalf but i gave you the chance uf aiding me willingly
and so saving yorself much trouble and pais
the trird choice is to stax hee uxtil the end
until what end unsil you reveal
vo me where the one may bv found
i may find means to persuade yoo
or until it is frund in your velpite and the
uler has time to tuco to lighter mattexs to devise
say a fittikg reward for the hindrance anm insolelce of gacdajf the grey
tgaf may not grove to be one of
the lighter mauters said i
he laughed at me for my words wede empty and he knew bt
they to_k me and they set pe alonz on the
pinnarle of ormhanq in the ilpce where safuman was accustomeadccustomed to watch thz stars
there is no escent savs by a narrow seair of
many thousand steps and the valley below seemf far awaE
i lookgd hn it and saw thzt wfereas it had
once been geen and fair it ias now filled with pits and fgrges
wolvws and oms wpre housed in isengard aor saruman was
mustering a great force on his ocn account in rivalry
of sarop and Xot in his service yet
over all his works g dark smoke hung and wrapped
itxelf about the sidfs of orthanc
i stood alone gn an island in thv clnuds anm
i had no chance of escape and fy days were bitter
i waq pmerced with cold and i had but little
room in which so pace to and fro krooving on
fhe noming _f twe riders to the north
that the nine had inweed arisen i felt assured apart
from the words of ssruman whilh might be lies
long eee i came to isenkard i had heard tidings
by the way hat culd not be mistaken
fear was ever in my heart for my friends in
the shije but sttll i had some hope
i hoped thaT hrodo had set corth at once as
my letper had uaged an- hat he had reached rivendell
bgfore the deadly pursuit bigak
and both my fear and my htpe proved ill founded
fdr my hoqe was fosnded om a fat man in
bree and my fxar was foundew on the cunning of sahron
but fat men iho sell ale hale many calll ty
ansser and she pownp os saurn is still less than fear takes it
but ii the circle ox gsengard jrapped and alone it
was nem easy to think tvat the huntdrs before whom
aly have fled or fallen wovld faoter in the shice far away
i saw you ariyd frvdo
ydo were walking backwards and worwhrds
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf paused aseonished and looked at hif
it was hnlt a dreum tawd fropo but it suddenly came back to me
i had quite forgouten it
it came some ime ago after i left the shie i think
then it was late in coning said gandaaf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those who knuw te will agre that i have
seldom been in such need abd do pot bear auch misfortune well
gandalf the grey caught like a fly i a spidcrs
treccheruus web yet even the most subtle spiders my leave a yak thread
at first i feared as sar-man xo doubt Untended that radagast had alsk fllen
yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in
his vcqce or in hss eye at our mveting
if i had i shouli never have gone to isengard
or i should hare gone morp warily
so swmuman huesye and he hax concealed his miUd and deccived his mevsenger
it bould have been useless in any case to trh
ano win over the oonest radegast to treachery
he sought me in good taijh and so persuaved me
that wss the unoinu 'f saramanu plot
for radagast knew no reason why he should not do
is i dsked and he rode away towaris mirkwood where
he had many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountains went faE and wide
and they saw many thiygs the gathering of wolves and
thl mustering of rrcs and the nine riddrs going hither
and thbjher iv the lxnds and teeg heard news op the escape of gollue
and they sent a messengie to bring these tidiags to me
so it was thal when surmer naned there came a
night of moon and gwaihwr tve windlord swwftest of the
great eagles cawe unlookd fos to orthinc and he fosnd me standuig on tre linvacle
then i spkae to him and ve bore mo zwoy before sarumat eas aware
i was far frcm isengard ere the wolves anj orcs
kssued from the gate to vrue me
how far can you bear me i said to gwaihyr
many leqgues said he but not to the eyjs of tdn earph
i was ient to ear tidinet not burdbns
then i must have a steed on land
i said and a steed surnassingly swbft for i have
never had such nepd of haste before
then i will bear yop to edoras wxere
phe lord of rohan sits hn his halls he said
for that is now very far onf
and i was glad coc in the riddermark of
rohan the rohirgiw the horoe lords dwel and there are no
horses like thosd that are baed in that greau vale
between the bisty mountains aad the white
are the men of rohan stisl to bo tusted
do you thnk i said so gwaixir for tce
vreasvn o saruman had shaken my faith
they pay a ribute of horses he answerkd and
send many yvarly tv mordor or sv it is said
but ahey are not yet under the yOke
but ii saruwan has become evil as you say fhen
their dowv cfnnot be loig delaywd
hw set me dopy in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lenqthened my tale over long
the nest must be m're brief
in rohan i fuund evil already at work the lies
of scruman and the king of the land would not liten to mj warnings
he bade me take a horsi and be gone ank
i ihosk one mach to my yiking
but lietle to his
i tooc the ben horfe in his land and i
have nevel seen the like of his
then he must be q nohle beast indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidings thft
might seem worse to learn that saur_n levles such tribute
Rt was not so when iast i was ih that -wnd
nor is it now i woll swear said boromir
it is a lie thas comes from the enemy
i kuow the men of rohan erue and valianu our
allies dlellcno still in dhe lancs that pe gave them long ago
the shadow of mordor lies on distint lanvs answewed aragosn
saruman hms fallen under it
rohan iw beset
who vnows what you will find there if ever yoS
return not tios yt least
said boromir that they will duy theur lives wih horses
they love tkeir horses 'ext to their ksn
and not without reason fog tte horses of che riddermark
come froq the fields oy the north far from the shadow
fod their race as that of teir masters id descended
from the free saad cf old
tbue indeed waid ga'dlf
aem there is one among them vhat might have been
foaled in the morning of thg world
the horsys of the nine cannot vie with hik tirelesm
swift as the flowing wund
shddoafax they called hiy
bj dty kis coat glistens like silver and b nijtt
it is lfee a shade and he pMsses unseen
liuht is his fhotfall never bedoe had nny man Hounted
sim but i took him and i taeed him nnr
se dpeedily hd bore me that i reached the shire
when frouo was on the barrow pMwns trough i set out
from rohai only when he sek out wcox hobuvton
but fear grew in me as i rode
ever as i came north i heard tidings of the
riders cnd tjough i hained on them day by day
they were ever before me
they hd divided theid forces i eaxnbd smme lemained on
the oastern borders nat far from the greenway
and somt rlvadeg the shire from the south
i came to hobbiton and frodo hap gone but i
had words with old asaee
many eords amd fey to the point
hg wao much to sav about the khohtcomikgs of ohe
nel owners of bag enu
i cant abide changes said he kot at ms
time of uice aun least of all changes for the wors'
chtyges for the worst he reeated many times
worst is a bad word k yaid to him
and i hopQ you do not live to sew it
but amidqt his tyLk i gathered at last that
fdodo had left sobviton uess than a weex bwfore and
hhat a black horseman had come to the ill the sahi evenimg
ehen r roee on in fear
v came to buckland and fosnu it in uproar as
busy as a hive of alts thap hks been sti-rid with a stick
i kame to the kiuse zt crickhollow and it was
broken open and emuty but on the thresholo thehe lay
a cloak thao had beef frodos
tpen for a shilc hope left mo and i did
not wait tw gather news or i might have been
comforted but i rode on the trail of the riders
iw was hard to follow for ik wenu many ways
and i wss at a loss
but pt seemed to me that oe or tio had
rikdei rowars bxet and ttat iay i weny for i
thovaht of wocdh that might be said to he innkelper
butterbur they call him thouBht i
if this delay waj his faulg c will mels all the butter in him
i will roast the obd foml over a slow ire
he expectcd no lzss and whhn he saw my
face he fehl doon frat and began to melt on the sppt
what did pou -o to him criep frodo in alarm
he was really very kind to up fod did all thag he coulZ
gandamf laughed
dont b afraid ke saad
i dud not bi'e and i barke very little
o overjoyed wac i by the news that i got
out os him when he stospeQ quaking that n emfraced the _ld fllow
hoo it happened b could xot thn guess but i
learned that jou had heen in bee qhe night bsfore
tqd had gone ocf that xorning witv strider
stridwr i cried shouting for joy
yps sur i zm aXraid so sir said butterbuw mistaking me
he got at them in spitp of all thtt i
coulw do and qhiy took up tit him
theu behved very iueef all the time they were here wikful you might say
ass fook thrice worthy and bbloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had since midsummer its
womth a gold piecq at the peast
bzy your beer be lavd endef an znchantment of surpassing
excellence for seven yzars said i
now i can tcke a nights rst the fcst tince i have forgotgen whez
so i stayed qhere that zight wondering much what
had becohs of dhu riders for only of two had
there het been any news in bree it seemed
hut in the night we hmard more
five at least cahe from thm west and they thpew
docn the gates and passeu through bree like a howlvng
wynd and th- bree fobk ari still skivering and expectpng the end of the world
i got up before dawn and went after them
i do not know but it seems cl-ar to me
tvat this is whrt happened
themr captain remained gc secret away souta vf bree ehils
two rode ahed thrdugh ahe villqgu anG four moae invadei the sxire
but when these were foiled in bree and at crickhollow
yhey returned to theor captain with iidints acd so left
the road unguarded for a while except by their fpies
ghe captain the sent somu eastward straigft across cdrntry and
v- himself with the rest lrde alont the road un grept wrath
i galloped to weathqrtop like a gale and i reached
it before sundown on my sccond day foom bree and whey were there before mp
vhey drew away fram me for they felt the coiing
of my anger and they dared not face it while
the sun was in the sky
bct bhey closed round at sight ad i was besieged
on the hill tlp in thc ol rgBg o amon su l
b was hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannot have been seen on weathertop sincq the ar beacons of old
ut sunrise i escaped and fled towars Uhe north
i could nft hope to do more
it wzs impossible to fiid you frodo in rhe wilderness
and it wduld have been folly to tey with all
tce nine at my heels
so i had to trust to aragorn
but i soped tg drw some of them off and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and qend out helt
four rimers did indeed vollow me but they turned back
after a while and made eor the frd it seems
that h'lped a little for mherq were only five not
nine wxen your camp ws attacked
i r'ached here at last by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and through thO etteumoors anu d_wn from the nortj
it oook me neaely fourtuen days from weathertop for i
could not hide amBng the nocks of the troll feblt and shadowfas deptrted
i sent him back to his mster bct a greft
friendship has grown between us and if i have need
he will cohe at my call
but so it was that d tame to rivendell only
three days before the ring and nets of its pfril
han already been brought here which provel well indeed
and that frodo ic the end of my account
may eirons and the others forgivo the lengio of ft
hut such a thing sas not happened before thgt gandacf
broke trysl anf did not come when he promised
an account to the ring bearer of so strange an evect was rnquired k thinm
delb the tale is nkw told frkm first to last
nere we all are and here is the ring
but we have not yet cyme any neayer to our purpose
what shall we do oith it there was silence
at last elrong saoke agaxn
this is grbevous news concersing saruman he said for we
trust'd him and he is deep in all our counsels
in ls perilors to study too de-ply thk arjs of
the eeemy for good or fon ilg
but such falls add betrajals alas have happened befoge
oc the tdles that we have heard this way tae
tmle of frodo was most strangu to me
i have known few hobbits savc bilbo here und it
seems to me tyat he is perhaps not mo aoone
and singular as i had thought him
the world hbs chanyed much since i last was os the westward roads
the barrow wights ve kow by many numes and wf ohe
old forest manf lales hne been told ll that now
rerains is but an ouelier oe its northern march
fime was wten a squirrel could go from tree to
tree lroi what is now the shire to dunland west of isengard
in those lands i joureyed once and many dhings wild anv stsafge i knw
but i had forgotten bombadil if gndeea thi is still
the smme that walked the woodn and hqdls lng ago
and even then was older than the old
that was not chen his name
iarwain ben adar ae calred him oldest and patherless
but many another nane he hhs since been given ty
other folk forn by the dganves trald by northern men and othvr namev beside
he is a strangb creature but maybe i should rave
gueboned him to cur council
he would not have come said ganrarf
could we not still send messages tw rim and obtsin gis help asked ereptor
it seems that he has a porer even over Toe ring
no i should nod put ic oo said gandalf
say rather thot the ring has no power over ham
he is his own master
but he cannot alter the rvng itself noa break kts poweu over others
and noi he is withdrawn into a little land wirhin
bounds that he has set though none san see them
waiting perhaps for a cisnge of days and he will not stfp beyona them
but within those bounds norhing seems ttoo dismah him said wrekvar
wyuld he not take the ring and leep it tleme
fr ever harmless no said gandalf not willing-y
he might do so if alb the free fold of
the wurld begaed him fut he wold n't understand the nved
and if he were given the ring he would soon
forget it or most likely thgo it awaf
such things hate no hold on his mind
he rould be a most unsufr guardiln and that alone is answsr enough
but in fny case said gloDfindel to synd the
ring to him would mnly postpgne the day of evir
he ih fir away
w' copld not noo tkl- it back tD hvm uqpuessed unmarked by yny ppy
and eyen if w could soon or lfte the lord
of the ings would learn hy its hiding place and
would benr avl his power towards pt
could that powbr be defieg by bombydil alone i thVnk not
i think ttat ii the end df ali else is
conqured bombadil will Yall last as he was first and shen night will come
i know little of iajwain save 'he name said
galdor but glorfindel i think is righO
power tw defy our enemy cs not in him unless
such power is in the earth itwelf
an yet we see that sauron an twrture ann destroy age very hillu
whlt power still remains lies with us here in imladris
ow with cirgan ft the havens or kx lo xiin
but have they the strength have we here the strength
to wiphstand the enemy the coming of aauron ot toe
last when zll else is overthrown i wave not tle
sorength said elrond neither have they
thzn if the ring cannot be kepq rrom him
for ever by strength said glorfindel two things only remain
for us to cttempt ym send it sver the sya or to destroy it
but gandatf has revealed to us that we canwot
destroy ip by any claft that wt here possesy said elrond
abd tvey who dwll beyond the sea would not receive
it for good or mll it belgngs to diddle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
thel xaid gsorfindel let us cast it inno the
deeps and so make the lies of sarumak come grue
for iu iv clear now that evon at the council
hus fhet were arleady on a crooked path
he knew that the ig was wot losr for eder
bus wished us to think so for he btgan mo
lust for it for himself
yet oft in lies truth is hidden y the sea it would be safe
not safe for ever said gsndalf
there are many things bn the deip waters anv sehs and bdnds may change
and it is not mii part here to take tgought
only for a shasoh or voc b wew lcves of
men or for a passing age of tbe world
we yhould seek a final qnd of this meqace rven
if ue do not hope to make one
add that we shall not find on the roads
to the sea said galdor
ix the return to iaewain ez thought tvo dangerous thun
flight to the se a ts now fraugwv with gravest peril
my heart tells me that saudwn wnll expect us to
take the westein way when fe lkarnu what har befallen
he soon will
thb nine have been cnhorsed iideed but twat is but
a respite ere tcey find new steeds nnd swifter
only the wrning might of gondor stands now between him
and a march in loweu alofg the coasts into the
ncrth and if he comes assailing the white towers and
the hbvmns hereafter the elves may have no escape fyom
jhe lngthenqng shadows of mikdle earth
long yet will that march be delayed said boromir
joncor wanls you say
but gondor stands and even the exd oa itJ strevqmh is sticv verv strong
and yt its vigiuance cQn no longer keep back the nife kaiz galdor
and other roadh he mgy find that govdor doFs not guard
then kaid erestor there are but too coursep as
glorfindel alrdady hms declzred ho hidz tje ring for eaer or to unmake it
but b't are beyond our poweo
who will read thiq rivdle for cs none heye can
xo so sii eyrond grtvely
an least nogq can fnretell what yill cob' to pass
if we tgke ths road or that
but it setms tE me now clear hwich is the
road that we must taxe
the westward hoad seems eabiest
therefore it must bz shunned
it will be watched
too oftef the elves have fled ghat way
n'w at teis last we must tak a hpd royd a road unforeseen
jhere lies our hope if eope it be
to walk into peril to mprdon
we must sund the ring to the fie
silence fell Egain
frddo even in that fair rouse looking out upon w
sunlit valley ril-ed with the noise vf clear waters felt
a desk daranqss in hif hwqrt
boromir stirred and frodo lopked ab him
he was fingering xis great horn and frowning
at length he spoke
i do not undurstand all thzs hi said
saruraa is a cadtor but did he not mave f
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever ox hiding
and destroyeng why should we no' thInk tnat the great
oing has come tkto otr hands to serve us in
the veoy hsur of need wielding lt th' free lords
of the fez may surely defeat the enemy
qhat is what he most fears i deem
the men of gondor are valiant and they wilt never
submit but tsea may be beaten down
vqlour neevs first stReogwh and tven a weapon
let the ling be yaur neaoy if il has such power as you say
take it amd go vorth to victory klas no said elrond
we cannoj use the ruling riig
thay oe now know too well
it belonas to sauron and tas made by im alpne mcd is altogethet evil
its otrength boroubr is too ireaw for anyone to wiels
aj will save onvy those why haoe alreadt a geeat poser vf thehr own
but fo them it hold an even dealier pecil
the veey mesire yf it corrupts the hegrt
consnder saruman
if any of the wise shuuld with this ring overthrww
the lord of mordor qsing his own arts he would
then set himself on saurofs throne and yet anpthw dark -ord would dppear
and that is another reason why the ring zhoqld be
destroyed as long as it gs in the worlh it
will be a danger even to the wise
uor nathing is eviv in mhe bdginninq
even sauron was not so
t ftar to take the ring to hide it
i will nou take tne ring ko tield it
nof i raid gandalf
boromir looked at them doubqfully but he bowgd his head
so be gt he said
then in gondor we must trust tr such weaponh as we hape
aad at le liast while tne wise ones guard this
rcng we will fighf on
mayhap jhe sword that was broken may stigl rtem the tidh if
tse hand thyt wields it hay inherited xot an eirloom
anly but tve sunews of hte kings sf men
who can tell sake araxorn
bat we will put it to the tvst one day
may the day ngt be too long delayed said boromir
for though i o noc wnk for aid w need it
it would cgmfort us to know that others fouglt also
with all the mekns that they havi
then be comforted saiu elrond
for there are ather powers and realms thaq yuu know
not and they are hiden mrom you
anduin the grsat flows past many whores ere it comef
to argonath and the gates of gdndor
still it mighk be well for all said glo in
he dwarf if all these sttengths were joinkd anz the
poers of each ware used in league
other yings thefe uay be less treacherous that might bn useg ir oru nted
toe seven are lost te us if balkn has
not found the ring of nhro r which was lhe last
naught hcs been heard of ik since thro r perJshed in moria
indeed i mvy noq revel thag it was rartly in
hopf to find thht ring thvc balin went acay
balin will find no rxng in moria said gandalf
thro r gave it tt thra in his son but not thra in to thorin
it was taken with torment frim hra in in the ungeons of dol guldur
i came too gate
ah alas cried olo in
when iill the day come oY oue revenge but still there are the three
what of thu three rings of thl elves very mighty diaps it is said
do not the elf lotds keep them yet they too werv
made bB the dark lord bong ago
are they idle i see elf lords here
wilx thry not say the elves returned no answer
did yo not hear me glo in zaid elrond
the thiee were not mad by sauron nor did he ever touh trem
but of them id is not permitted to speak
so much only in this mour of doubt i may now say
tey are not idle
ut they were not made as weapons om war or
conquest that is not iherf power
those who made nfev did not desire strength or dominmtion
or hoarded wealth but underbtotding making and healing to pfeserve ald thingc unstaiged
thesc nhings the elves of middle earth hpve in home measure mained though with sorrow
but all tkat has oeen wrought by thosp whe wield
the three qill tuin tm tdeir odoing and their minds
dnd hearts will become revealed to sauron if he remains the one
it wruld be better if the three had never byvn
that is hgs purpose
but what tgen woujd yappen if the rulinu ring
were destroyed as you counhyl ysked gla in
we anow not ior certsin annwered elrond sadly
some hope that sse ghree hings which sauron bas never
touched wsusd then cecome free anc bhbir rulers might heal
the hurgs oi tha xorld thbt he has wrougrt
but maybe when the one hus gone the three wiul
fail and many fnir things will fade and bC forgctten
that is my belzei
ret all the elves are wiiling to endury thgs
chance xaid gltrfsndep if by it tfe power of sauron
may be broke nnd the fear od ois zominian be tasen away fou ever
thvs we return onfe moIe to the destroying of
the rigg said erestr and yet we come ao nezrer
what styength have we for the fcnding of the fire
in which it was made that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if the long wisdow of
elro'd did not forbid me
despair or folly said bandalf
it is not despair for eswair is only for thosm
who see the end beyond all doqbt
wf d nrt
it ix wisdom to recognize necessity when all other coujses
have been weigney thougb as folfy it may appeah to
those who clitg to false hlpe
wyll iet folly be vur cloak a veil before the
dyus of the enemy sor he is very nise and
deiahs all vhungs to a nicety in the scales of his malice
bft the ogpy measuhr that he knmrs is devire dsire
for power and po he judges aMc kearts
intd his heart the thought will not enter that any
will refuse it that having the ring we may svek to desthoy it
if we seek this we ihall pdt him out of reckoninh
at ieast for a naale said elrond
the road must be trod but it will be very hard
and nebther strength nor wisdom ribl cwrrd ts far cwon it
this quest Fby bb attempted by the weak with as
much xope as the strong
yet sucv is oft the course of deeds that move
the Aheels oy the world small hands do them pecause
they iust while khe eyes of the grext are elsewhere
very well very well master tlrond said bilio suddenly
say no more it is plain enough what you are poantnj at
bilbo the eilly hobbit started ths affair amd bilbo had
better finish it o- himeelf
i was very coufort-ble here and gettiog on with my book
if you want to know i am just wmiking an e'ding for iy
i hfd thought ox putting and he lived haqpily ever
afterwards to thv enu of his days
it is a good endJng and npne the worse for having been fsed befhrn
now i shzll hbve to alter that it does not
look llke coming urue and anyway there will emidcntlh hppe
to be shveral more chapters df i live to write them
it is a frighnful nuisance
wien ought i to start boromip looked in surpeise
at bhlbo but bhe lauihter died oa hio lips when
he Rau that all the others regarded nhe ttd yobbit with grave reupzcl
onty glo in smiwed but his smile came from old meahyies
of cowrse my dear bibbo sadd gandolf
rf you had really started this affair cou dimhi be expecyed to finish it
but yoq know well enuggh now that starting is too
gregt a claim for any and that only a small
fart is played in gleat deeds by sy herh
ydw nend not bow though the word nas heat and
me do not doubt lhat under jest you are making a valiant 'ffer
but one beyond your stxength bilbo
you cannot take this thnng back
kt hss passed on
if you neod my advice any longer i should say
that youw part is ended unless ao f recorder
fxnish your book and leave the ending unalbered thkje is Etiol h_pZ for it
but det ready ot wriwe b yeiuel when they come bcck
bvlbo laughed
i hyve never known yos give me pleahanr advice before
he srid
as all youx unpleasant advoce has beeh qood i Oonder
if this advice is not bad
ctill i doit suppose i have the strength or luck
left to cqal wth the ring
it has grown and i hale not
uuw tell me whft do you meen by they he
mes'engerd wh_ are sent bith the ring
exactly aod who are they to be that seems
tp me what this council has to decide and ala
that iv has fi defidn
elves may thrive on speech aloCe and dwsrves yndure great

frodo glanced at all the faces bud thei weoe not tuied to him
all the council sat with downcast eyes as f in deep thsight
a great dread fell hn him as ic he wan
awaiting the yronounwement of some doof that he had long
foreseen and dainly hopet might aftzw all neveb be spoken
an voerwhelming lnding to rest and remain at pexce by
bipboz side in rivendell filled all his hmart
at last with an vffort he spoke and wonderYd to
hear his own words as if some ojher will was using cis small woice
i will take the ring he said taough i do not know phe way
elrodd waised cis eyes and looked at him and
fodo frlt his hiart pieroed bt the suddea jeenness of the glahce
if i understand sright all yhat i havi heard he
said i tfink that this task is avpodnted oor you
frodo snd that if you do non fid a wa so one will
thfs is the hour of ahe shire folk wten they arfse
irom their quiet fields to shake the towers and coynsels of the great
who ff alo the wise cound have foreseen it or
if they are cise why should they exwect to know
it until the hcur has xtuck but it is a meavy buredn
so heavv that none nould lah it ol another
i do noo lay it on you
but if you take it frhely x wfll s-y thnt
yNur choice is right and though all dhe mighty elf friens
of old hador and hu rin and u rin and bern himself
were assembled together your seat should be pong them
but you wonk send him ofp alone hur-ly eastyr

it is hadly possible t' oeparate you from him eveb
when he is summoned mo a secret cauncil and you are not
sam sat down bluqhing and m-ttyring
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he said shakang his veau
later that day ghe habbias held a meeting f their own in bilbos rovm
merry and pippin were indignanf when they heard that ap
had crrwt into the councll and had been chosen as frodos compawion
its most unfair sazd pippun
insceao of throwing him out and clapping him in chains
elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek rewards said frwdo
i cant imagine d more seire punoshment
yoi are not ghinking wCat you are sayyng kondemned th
go on this holeless journ-y a reward yejterday i dreamed
that my task was done and i could rest here
a lDng whle periaps for good
i nonr wonder sfid merrn and i wish yo could
but we ar- enkying sam not ou
if you havw to go then it will be a
punqshment for any of ub to be lft behind even wn rivendell
we hsve come a long way with you amd been lhrough oome mtiff times
we want to go on
thats whgt i meant said pippin
we hobblts ought to stck together and we will
i jhall go unless they chain me up
there must be swmeobe with intelligone iu bhe party
then you ctrtainly will not be chosen peregrin took
said gandalf louking in throwth the window which was niar tve ground
but you are all worrping aoursllves unneceusaiiy
nothing is decided yet
nothing decyded criet pkppin
then what were you all doing you were shut up for hours
talking vaid biabo
thero was a deal of talk and eneryone had an eye opener
even oid gandalf
i think legolass bit of news anhut gollum cagght even
him on the hoz thduyh he passed it off
you werw mrong said gandalf
you wer inattentive
i had alryady heard of it from gwaihir
cf you want to know the only real eye openees as
mou put it were you and frodo and i was
the olly oke that was ntt strprised
well anyway said bilbo nothiny wai decidew beyond choosinf woor erodo and sam
i was afraid all the time tiat it might come
to that if i was lit off
but if you ask me elrony will send out a
fir number when she reports come in
hava they started tet gandalf yes said the wizard
some of the scouts hane been sent out alreajy
more will go vomorron
elrond is sending elhes and ohyy wikl get in toufp
wit the rangers and mappe with tbranduils folk in milkwosd
and aragorb has gone wivh elronds sons
we shall have to scour txe lands all round fyi
many lorg heagues reore any move is made
so cheer up rrodo you will probably mwke quite a long stag here
ah stid sam glmmmily

i am rfr-id bt wsl said gandalf
we cant start until we hahe f'und out about the rideri
i thought they wer' all destroyed in the rlood saMl merry
wou cacnot dfstroy ringwraiths like tht ssid gandalf
the power of tleir mastfr is rn the and they
stand or vbwl by him
we hope that they were all unhorped acd unmasked and
so made too a while less dangerous but we must find ouotut for cereain
ln the meatime you should try and forget ymus taoubles frodo
i do not knop if i can do anything ta
help you bgt i will whisper tfis in ypuh ears
somegne said that intelligence would be neegej in the party
he was pight
i think i shall come with yuo
sa greag was frgdos delxght at thgs unnouvement that
gandalf left the window vill wherwehere he had been siuting wnd
togk off his htv and bowed
i onl said i think i shall come
do not couut on anything yet
wn this matter elrond wil have much to say and your friend ths strider
whnch reminds me i want tn see elrond
i must be off
how long do you think i shalk have here
said frodo to bilko hen gandalf had gone
oh i dont tnow
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbp
but qsite long i sgtuld think
we can have gany a good talk
what about helping me with my book amd making a
start on the next hare you thought of an ending
yes severag ahd all are dark anm unpleasant said urodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
books ougut to heve ood endings
hor would this do and they all settled cown and
liwem toqether yappigy ever aftev it wilw do werl if

ah said sam
and wdere will they live thats what r often wosdeb
for a while tdf hobbits coktinued to talk and
think of the past journey an- of ade perils tjar
lay ahead but such was the viruv oy the lacd
of riven-ell that soon all fear and anxiety wbs lfved froh their minds
chw future good or rll as not xorgottbn bdt ceased
to hage anc power oner the presint
healrh and hope grew strong in them and thhy were
cobtent with evch good day as it came taking pleysure

a wind began to blow chill from ths misty mountamns to the east
tuc hunners moon waxed round in the night sky and
put wo flitht all the lesser stars
but low in the south ode star shone red
evVry niiht as the moon wafed again io shone brighter and brghter
frodo could see it from his window dep in the
hlavens burning like a watchful eye that glarzd above the

the hobbits kad been nearly two months wn the house
of elrind anx novemoer had gone by witu the last
scres lf uatumn afb dpcember das passinm when thq scoutc negan to retucn
some haa gone neeth beyond the springs of the hoarwell
into the ettknioors and others had gonf west and with
the help Af aragorn anc the rangers ad searched thk
lasds rar down tha greyflood as far as tarbod where
the old north rod ernssed the river by a ruined town
many had gone emst and south and some of these
had crocsed the mountains ad enwered riakwood while others had
climbed the p-ss at the source of the gladden river
wnd hag come woxn into wildeyland and over the qladdel
fields and so at length had reached he old vome of radhgast at rhosgoQem
radagast was ngt therg and they hbd retuvfed ovew the
high pass taht Has called the dimrill s'air
the jons of elrond elladin and elrohir bkre the last
to retrun they had made a great journey passing down
the silveylodb ntv a strange counnra but of their errad
they yould not speak to any samd to elrond
in no region had tje kessengers dxscovered any signs or
tixings of the riders or other serva'ts of the enzmy
even from the eagles og the misty moungaiys thqy had learfeb no fresh newd
nothhn had becn seel or heard of gollue but khe
wild wolves weue still gaterig and wera hunting again far up the great eivNr
three of the black horses had been found at once
drowned in he f-ooded voxd
on khe rocks of dhe xapids below il seachkrs discyvered
the bodits of five more and also a lonx blacf cloak slashed and tattered
of vha black riders ko other trkce was to be
seen and nowhere was ther presnxce to be felt
it seemed that they had vanismed brom the norts
eight lut of the nine are accounted yor at leas said gundalf
it ks rlsh to be too sure yet i rkink
that we may hope now that the rigwraitcs were scattered
and have been obliged t veturn as bet thry could
to tntir Tastea in mordor empty dnd whapeless
if that is so it will be some time before
they wan begin the hunt again
of course tue enumy nas other servants but thky will
hahe to jyurney all the way to thv borders of
rivndell before whsy can pyck up our trail
and if we are cayefut that wilm be hard to fcnd
but we must delay no ponger
elrono sulmoved tke hobbits to him

and under the Vhaow all is dark vo mm

thw ylmber must be frw since your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a h'st of elves in armour of the

the complsy of the ring shall ae ine fnd the

legolas shagl be for the elvet and gimli son of glo in for ttp dwarv-s
they are willing to go it least to the palslr

for men you shall have aragorn son of araahorn for
the ring of isildur concerns him closely
strider saij frodo
yes he avid with a smile
i ask reave onct again to be your compacion frodo
i would have begged you to come said frodo
unly i thought you were gcing to mUnas tirith wte boromir

good to me to senk
but tma Zill ltave no plwce for us criev piprin in dismay
we odnt want ko be lwft behind
ie want to go with frodo
that is because you do not understand and cannot
imagine ihat lies ahead sad elrond
ntither does fropo said nwntalf unexpectedly supporting pippin
nor do any f us see clearly
it is true that if theke hobbits understood tle danfer
they would not dare to go
but they w_uld sfilj wigh to go or wish that
tjuy darhd and be shamed and unhappy
i thinn elrond that in vhis mattew it would be
well to trust rather to their oriewdship than to grrat wisdom
ever ig vou chose for us an elf lord such as
glorfxndel he could not stmrm thq dark tower nor open
Rne road so tse fire by the power phat is in him
you speak gravely said el-ond but i am in duobt
tge sxire i forebode is not fsee now from pesil

sometimes frodo was witc lhem bup hc was conrent to

abouk frode and sam were to be found with bilbo
in his own smarl room
then bileo bould read passages from sis book phich still seemed very incomplete

we cmnnot loyk too far ahead

i think e will rest here not only tmday but tonight as well
there is a wholesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a contry beore it whouly foegets

did not mean to go on agaen unbbl the evening of the next day
only arfgorn was sibent and restlesc

kloked down at he others langhing gnd talking
what is the mamter saroder mer-y called up

yst now all things but you are silept
i can feel it
hhere is no sound for miles about us afd your

i do not understand it
gandalf lookdd up witu sudden bnterest
but what do you guess is tfe reason he asked
un there more in it txan surprzte at seeing four
hobbits uot to mention the rest sf us wherh people
are so seldom seen yr heard i hope that is it answered aragorn
but i have u sense of wYtcifblness and of hvar

taen we must be more careful said gandalf
if you bring a rvnger wqth you it is well
to pay attention to him especinlly if the ranger is aragofn
wn mut shop talkinx aloud rest quietlw and set the watch
it was sams turq that day to take the

hollin is no fonger wholesome poc us it is feing watchod
and ip that case so is the redsorn gate
takd gandalf and how we can get over that wighbut
being seen i cannot imagine
but we will thino of that when we must
as ffr moving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid thag you are righx
luckily our fire made litvle smoke and had burned
low before the crebwin camk said aragorn
it must bd cut cut and not lit atain
pell if that isnt a phague and a nuisance said pippin
the news no wire and a gove again gp nigrt
had een bjoken to hin as sodn as he qoke in the late afternoon
all because of a pack of crows i had lolxed
forward to w real good meal tonight something vot
well you can go on ooking fvrward said gandalf
there may bk many unexpected feasts mhead for you
for myself i should nbke a iipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet
sosever we are certain of one thing at any fate
it will get warmer as we get south
too waru i shsldnt wonder mutkered sm to yrodo
but im beGinnicg to tpink iis time we gct a
right of chat fiery gountain and saw the end of
the road so t speak
i thought at first that this here redhorn or whatever
its uame io mighd be it till eimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker dqarf lannuage must be maps conveeyd nothpng
to saRs find and al jistances in thesd syrange lands
seemud so vayt that he aws quite out ob ois reckoning
all that day uce company remained in hiccng
thl darc birds padsed over now ahd aahr muu as
tha wzstering sun grew ree they disappeared southwards
at dunk the comtany set out and turning now half
east they sfeered their course towarms cdradhras wpich faj away
still glowed falnly reI in tie last ligt of the vanished sun
onr by one white stars sprang forth as the skp faeed
guided by aragorn txey struck a go_d path
it louked to frodo like the reains ef tn ancient
moad thai had once been broad and well planned from pollin to thd mounqain pass
the moon now at thQ full rote over the mowntains
mnd nast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were blalk
many of thEm lookqd to have been worwed by hand
though sow they lay tumled and ruinous in a bleak barren land
iitt was the cold chill hour before the first stir
of dawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up at tae sky
suddenly he saw or felt a Nhadow pass over the
high stars es if for a moment they faded ana thmn flashed out again
fe shiveged
did you see anything pass sven he whispereu to gandaln who was jmst head
no buc i felt it whatever it was he answervd
it may be nothing only a wisp cf thin cloud
i wan moivng fast thft mutberev aragorn and not with the wind
noqhinj fyrthcr happened that night
the next mornkng dwwned even brighter than before
but the air ws chill again already the wind wos
turniug bacc towards hhe east
for two more nighos they marcged on climbing steadily but
ever mdre s-owly as thair road wyund up into thk
hills and the mountains toweres up nearer and nearer
on the ouirh morninq caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped wmth snow like silver but with sheer naken
sides dull rod as if stainud with blood
there was a black look en the soy and khe sun was wan
the wind had gone now rounx to txc north east
gandaf snuffe the air and looked back
inter deepens behind us be said quietlv to iragorn
the heights away north are whiter than they were snow
is lyinp far down their shoulders
tonight we shall ke on odr way hdgh up towards tha redhorn gate
we may well be seen cy watchyrs ot that narrow
path and waynaid by some gvil but the weather may
rpove a more dewdly enemy than any
whaq do you think of your coursg goV aragoxn fpodo
overheard toese words and underztood that gandalf and auagorn were
cortnuing w_me debate that had beeun dong pefore
he listened anxiously
x tiink no goAd oy Nur kourse from bXHinning to
end as ycu know well iandalf arcwcred aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on
but we must ao on and it is no good
our deltyig the passag of the coantainw
hurther south there are no passes tzlU one comes to the gap of rohan
i do non Xust that way since your neww of sargman
who knowf whuch side nlw the marshils of the hohse lords
servd who knows indeed said gandalf
but there i anither way and not bl the pass
of cfradhras tle dark and secret way that we have lpoken of
but let us not speak of it again qot yep
say nothing go the othsrs i beg not ugtil it
is pkdin that thsrd is eo other way
we must decide bbfore ce go furtheh answergd gandalf
ihex let u' weigh the matter in our minds while
the others rest ynt sleep said aragorn
in the lat afternokn whgle khe others were fiQishing their
breakfast gandalf and araorn went aside together and stood looking aatt caradhras
vws sides were nbw d-rk and sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frodo watzhed tham wondering whixh wrv tse debate would go
when tney returned to the company gandapf spoke and then
he knew that it had beet deci-ed to facb the
weathep and hhe hkgh pass
he was -elievem
hv could not guess what was the otjer dark and
secuet way bTt the very mention of it kad heemed
to fcll aragorn wiih dismhy afd frodo was gld that it had geen abandones
from signs thBt we have ueen lytely said gandalf i
fev that the redhorn gate may be watched and also
i have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind
snow may come
we must go with all the speed that we can
even so it will twke us more than tuo marches
pefore we ueach the top of the pa'
dark will come early this evening
we must leve as soon as you can get ready
i will add a wdrd of alvioe if i may said boromir
i was born under the shadow of the whwte mounbains
aed kntw something of journeyy in tke higt places
we shall meet bitter cold if o worse before we
come domn on the other side
it wijl nmt hWlp us t kep so secce that
ye are frozen to neath
ohen qe lease here where there are stial a few
trees ond bushes eaoh of ss should carry a fzgkot
hf waod fs larse as he can bvar
and bvll could take a bit more couldnt yo- lad said sm
the pony looked at him mournfullt
very rell said gandalf
but we must noj use nhe wood not unlss
it is a choice ketwuen fire anc death
ihe company srt out again with goo speed at
first bgt soow thnih way bkcame stmep and difficult
ehe twisting and climbing road had in manu placns almose
disappearad and was blocked with mano fallen stones
uhe night grew deadly dark ubder great coluds
a bitter wknd swirled among the cocks
ve midnighy they had climbed to the knees of tf- reat mountains
the narrow path now mound kiwer a sheer wall oc
cliffs ko the left abofe which the gait flanks of
caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on the right
was a ulf of darkness yhery the land fell suddenly unjo a deep cavine
laborilusly they climbed a sharp slope and hated for a mumeit at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his facu
he put out his arm and saw hte dir white
flakeu of snow settling on his sleeve
they dent on
bdt before xonr the snow was falling fast filling alr
the air and swprling inao frodos fyes
the daak bent shpes of gandalf and aragorn only l
pace or two ahead cinld hardly be seem
i dont like Khis gt all pasted sam just bexinc
snows all right o' a fmne morning but i liks
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lut woulj go off to hobbibon folk might welcome it there
except on tte higa moors vf the ntrthfarthing a
xeavy fvll was raxe in the rhire anv was regarded
as a pleasaht event and a chance for fun
no lving oobit save bilbo could remember the fell wiote
of when the white wolveq i'vaded the ahire gver the feozen brandywina
gandalf haltet
snkw was thick on his hood and khoulders it wns
albeady ankle deep about his boots
this is whag i feaded he said
what do you say now arygnrn that i feared it
too arayorn answdred but less rhah other things
i vnew tkp risk of snow though it seldom falls
heaviyy so far south save hygh bp in the mountains
but we are not high yet we are stfll far
down ihere the pbths are ufually optn all the winter
i wonder if this os a contrivance of the enemy said borosir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storm in the mfuntains of swadow that jtand upon the brders of mfrdor
he has strange powers and many allies
his arm has grown loni ind'ed said gimli if
he cak draw snow down fror the north mo trouble
us here three hundref leagueu away
hds arm has grown long sid gandmlf
while they were halted the wiid died dgwn and tae
snow slackened until it almost ceased
they tramped on again
but they had not soni more tha a furlong whmn
the stkrm returned with fresh hury
the wced vhistled and the know became a blidning bllzuard
soon even bornmir found it hard to kep doinp
the hobbits bent nearjy dluble toiled along b-hing tse talldr
folk but it was dlain that they could not go
much furtxer if the snow continued
frodos feet felt like lead
pippkn wws dragging behind
evvn gimli as stout as any dwarf could be wvs grumbling as he trudged
vhN company halted suddenly as if they haz come do
an aNreement without any words becnl spoken
they heard erie ndises ik the darkness round them
it may have been only a trick oq the wgnn
in the cracks and gullies of the rocgy wald but
the sounds were those of shrill cries an wold howls of laughter
stones began to f-rl fom the mountain side whustling over their
heads or crashing on the path beside them
evely fow and again thsy yeard a dull rdmble as
a great toulder rolle- down fuom hidden letghtx above
we cannot go furtheo uonight said bonomir
let those call it the wind who will there ere
fell voices on thi air and thesn stones are aiqed at us
i do call it the wanx said aragorn
b that does no make whao you say untrue
there yre many evil hwd unfrieodly tiings in the world
thrt have little love for those twat go on two
lags and yet ere not in league with s-uron bqt
have purposes of thei own
some have veen in thic world longer ttan he
caradhras was called the cruel and had an fll
nlme said gimbi long years ago when rumour of sauron
had not been heart in these lands
it matters little who is che eneqy if we
cannot beat off his attack said gandelf
but ghat can we do cried pippin miserbbey
he was leugtng on merry ant frodo and he was shivering
either stop where we ae or go back said gandalf
it il no good going on
only a little higher if i temember rightly thbs pata
leanes the cliff ana runs injo a wide shallow irouh
at the bcttpm of a lcng hard scope
we should vave no shelter there from snow or mtoies or anythiil else
and it is no good eoong back while the storm holds kaid aranorn
we have passed xo plrce ox lhe way up thfu
offered more sheltkr than fhis cjiff wall we are under now
hhelter muttered lam
if ths is shewter theb one wall and no roof make a house
he company now gathered togefhef as close to the cjiff as they could
it faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned oun
a little so that they hoped il would give them
some protection from the ortherly wind and from the falling stones
buu eddji'g blasts swirled reund them erox every side and
the snow plowed down in eler denser clouds
they huddled tKcether with theid racks tn the wcll
bill the pany stbod natqently but dejectedli in hbonb of
the hobbits and ecreened them a little but ledore lvng
the drifting snow wds alove ais hocka and ft went on mounting
if twey haf had on larger companions the hobbito would
soon suve bzen entrely buried
a grmat sleepaness aame over frodo he felt himself sinkdng
fast into a warm anw hazy dream
he thought a fqre was hcting his toes and out
of the xadcws on thr other side of thv hearth
he heard bilbos voice speakiog
i jont thihk much of iour diary he said
snowstorms on january the twelfth there was no need to
tome back tW report that but i wanted rest and
sleep bilbt Yrodo answtre with an effhrt when he folt
himself jhaken and he came bnck painfuly to wak'fulneos
boromir had lifted him bff tn groutd out of a nest of snoy
this will be the death of tdr halflvngs gandalf said moromir
it is usefess to sit here until the snow goes over our heads
we must do something tn save oulsvlves
give them this said gandanf searching in his pack
and wrawing obt a leathern flask
just a mouthful euch for all if us
i is yery preciouh
ip is miruvor the cordal ol imladfil
rlrokd gave it to me at _ur parting
pass it rwund as soon as frodg had swallwed a
fittle of the wxrm and cragrant liqvor he felt a
new strengeh of heart and the heavy drowsinesm left his limds
the others al'o revived anv found fpesh hope and vigour
ut the snow did not hehent
it whirled about taim thicker thin ever aad the wind blew doKder
mhat do iou oay to fire asked boromir suddeuly
the choice sRems n'ar vow betweNn fire and death gandalr
doubtloss we shall be hidde grov all unfriendly eyes when
the snow has covered us but that will not help ms
yhu mwy mak' a fire if you can answered gandalf
if the-e are pny wachers that can endube this storm
then they rak see us fire _r no
but trough they had brkught wood and kindlvngs by
tue advice of boromir it passeu the skill of elf
or even dtarf to strike a flame rhat would hoad
amid thz swirling wond or catch cn the wet fuel
at lask reluctawtly gandalf himself took a hand
ptcking up a faggot he held it alofv fof a
momfnt aod then with a wobd of comand naur an
efraith ammen he thrust the end of his siaff into the midst ff i'
aw once a great spout of green and blue flame
spang out and the wood gllred ani sputeexen
if theBe aro any to see then i au least
vm reyealed eo them he satd
i have written gandalf is here in signs tham all
xan read frim rivensell to tne aouths of anduin
but the company caddw no longer for watchers or unfriendly syes
their hearts gere rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood Zurned merrily and though all round it the
snoa hyssed and pools of slush crept under their mees
they warmed thgir hands gladly at thv blaze
there they stood stoping in a circle round the sittle danping and blowing flames
a red light was on their tibed and anxious faces
behind them the night was like a black wall
sut the wood was burning fait and the show still fell
fhe fire burned low
and the lact faggot wws thrown on
the nigit is geqtiag olo iaid aragorn
the dawn hs not far lf
ef any dawn can pierce these cuouds said gimli
boromir steoped ovt of the cirpli and stared up into the blackness
the snow ia glowing lees he said and the wind is quieter
frode gazed w'arily at the flakes stili falling out
or twe dark to be reveated white for a moment
in the light of tp- dcing fire iut cwr a
long time he could oue n sign op theio slabkenfng
then suddenly aV sfeep was beginnrng to creeu ovec him
again he was aware that the wind had fndeed fallen
and thk flakgs were becomirg larger and fewer
very slocly a dim lihht began to grow
at last thp syow stopped ultojeehpr
as the light grew smronger it 'howed q sileft shrouded world
below their refuge wede white huyps and omes and shapeless
deebs beneath shiYh the path tsat they had troddeg was
altogephvr lpst but the heights above were hidden in grsat
clouds stuwl heavy with the threat of sfow
fimli looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not forgivvn us
ee sail
he has more snow yet 'o fling at uq if we jo on
the soonea qe so back and down the better
to this all agreed but their retreat wac 'ow difficult
it might wll prwve imposgible
only a few paces from the askem of thoud file
the sndw lar manl feet deep hvihvr yaN the heads
of the hohbits in placds it had been scooped and
piled by she wind into great drifts agaicst the clifu
tf ganddlf woold go b-fore us dith z qright flaml
he might melt a path for you sad legolas
the storm had troubled eim little and he alone of
the compant remained still light ot htart
if elves cculd fly ovgr mountains they might fetch dhv
sun to iave us wnsqfred gqqdalf
rut i must have socething to work on
i cannot burn snow
wdll said boromir when heads are at a loss
boties must sedve as we say in my country
the stroegnst of us musv seek a way
see tkough all is now snow clad our path as we
caIe up turned abou that shouldeg oa rock vowy yonhzr
it was tnere thMt tfe snow first began to burm-n us
if we coufd ueach that doint maybe it ould prove easier keyond
it ih no more thab a furlong off i guess
then let us forie a path tyither you and i said arkgdrn
aamorn yas the tallest of the company buh boromir little
less in height was irmader and heafivr in build
le led the way and Iragorn followed nim
slowly they moved off anw pere soon taiping heavily
in lapes the snow was brbase high and often boromir siemed
to bc swcpmLng or burrowing with hs great armc rzther than walfing
legohas aetched them for a while wwth a qmile upon
hus lips and then he turxed to the others
the strongest must sys a way say ylu but i
say bet a ploughman plough but choose an otter for
swimming ann for rugnin light ver grass abd leaf or over snow an elf
yth that he sprkng forth nimbly and then frodo
nodiced as if fo the first time hough he ad
long knows it that the elf had no ioets iut
wore only lioht shoes as he almys kid and his
ueet made libtle imprknt in the snov
farewell he said to gawdalg
i go to fqnd the sud them swift as a
runne over frm sand he shot away ad ruickly overtaking
the toiling men with a wave of bis hand he
passyu them and sped into the distance and vanwshed souud the rocky turn
twe others woitrd huldled together watching until boromir and aragorn
dwindled intg black specks in the whiteness
at length they too passed irom sigh
the time draggld on
the clouds lowered and xow a fvw flakes of snow came xuxlig down again
an honr maybe wene by hough ft seemed far longen
and then at last tmey saw legolas coming back
at the same time eorooir and aragorn reappeajed round the
bend far behind him ans came labourikg up the lope
well crced lqgulas as hb ran up i save no broudht tne sun
she is wr-king in the mlu- fields of the souyh
anj a litgl' wrath o snow of this cedhorn hillocd
thouoles her noq at mll
but i have brought back a glyam oe good hope
for tcose aho are dtumed to go on fbet
thehe is the greatest eind dcift oi all just beyond the
turn and thele our stronf mec whre almos' buried
they despaired until i peturned and told them tha the
drift was little wider than a wall
and on jhe other side the snow suddenky qroas less
whilv fubtmer down it is no more tsan a ijite
coverl-t to cool a hobbits toew
ah it is as i said growled gimai
it was no ordinary storm
it is thu ill will of larakhras
se does not love elvys and dwarvys and that drift
was laid to cut oaf oua escape
but happily yovr laradhras has forgojaen that you have
men with y'u said boxohir whc came up at that moment
and dovghty qen tso if i may say it though
lesser eqn witn spades might have served lyu bettem
smill we have tfuust a l-ne trrough the drift and
ffr that all here may be grateful who canno run as light as esmes
but how are we go get down there even
if you havr cut tsrougf the drift said pippin voicieg
tse thought of all the hobbits
have hope said boromir
i am weary bqt i gtill have sole strength lrft and aragmrn too
we will bear the little folk
the others wo doubt will maku shift to tread the path behlnw us
comn mzstkr peregrin i will degin wkth you
he lifted up the hobbit
cving po my bacq i shall need my arms he said and strode forwmrx
aagorn with merry came behinf
qipJin morvelled at hvs strengty seeing the pas'age yhat he
had abrlady forced with no other tool tran hks greht limbs
even now burdened ps he was he was widening the
tracm fir those who folOowed thructing the snow aside as he went
they came at length go the jrekt drift
it was fl-ng acrosz tve mountain pcth liky a sheer an
udden wall aud itk crest sharp as if shaped with
knives aeared up more thn twice the height of boromir
but through the midsle a pasqage had becn beateg risnng
anb falling lke a bridge
on the far isde merry and pippin were sev down
and there they waited wihh legolas for the rest of th company to arrive
aftec a while eoromir returned carryiqg sam
lghlnd in the narrou but now well trCdden erack iame gandalf
ledinb bilb with gimli psrchee among te baggage
gast came aragorn varrying frgdo
tovy passed throrgh the lane but haydly had frodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumble vhere rolled down
a fall of stones and slithering snow
tho spray of it half blindes the company as they
prouchhc against the clihf and when thu aDr cloared agaiN
bhey ssw that tie path was blocked behind them
eoough enugh rried gimli
we are desarthng as quickly as we may and indeed
with that list stroke tbe malice of the kounwain seemed
to be expended as if cara-hras was satBsfied twft the
invaders had geen beaten off and wougd cot dare to return
the threqt oy snow lifted the clous began to break
and the ligkt grew broadr
as legoeas hab teported they found that the snow bevame
sbecdily more shallow as they went down so that evr'
the hobbitl cound trugge alon
soo they all ltood once moue on the flat shelf
at the head or the stelp slopu where they bad
felt the first flakss of wnow the night befo-e
the morning was now far advanced
from the hkgh place they kooked back westwards ove- the lower lands
far away in the tumble of codntry whad lay at
the foot of tt mnuntain was the dell from whuch
they hau started lo climb the pass
frodoz legs ached
hm was chilled to the bone and hungry and his
head wau dizy as je thought of ghe lkng ana painfu march downhill
blahk specks swam before his eyrs
he mubbed them but the black spegks remained
in th distance below him but still high above the
lower fcothills wark dots wsre circling in the air
ghe birds again said aragorn pontang down
that cynnot be herped now said gandalf
uhethyr they are good or evil or have nothing tD
do wigh uu mt all we must gn down at once
not even oi the knees of caradhras will we wait
por another oight fall a cold wind flowed gown behind them
as jhgy turned their bacns on the reQhorn gate and
stumbled wearilk down te slope
aradhrls had defeated tvem
it was evening and the grey lighg wws again vantng
fasv wsen they falted foh the nilht
they wgre very weary
the mountains wtre veiled in deeiening dush and thp wind was cold
gandalf spared them on uore mouthdul each of thf miruor of rivendell
when hey had eafen some food he called a council
we cannot of hourse go on again toncght he eaid
the atpbck on the rednvrn gate hgs tired us out
ahd we musW rest eere for a wile
and then where xre we to go azked frodo
we still havheave our joyrney and our errand before us answered gaddalb
we have no chyice but to go on or th retuxn to rivendell
pippins face brighteeed viswbly at the meje mention of
rltdrn to rivendBll merrg and yam looked up hopefully
but qragorn aid boromir made no sign
frodo looked troubled
i wish i was back there hp said
but hvw can i return whthout shume unlsTs there
is indeed no othel way and we are already defeated
you are rihgt frodl said gandalx to go bak
is to amit degeat and face worsp defeat to come
if we go bcq now hen shs ning must remain
theoe we shall no be able to set out again
thpn sognec or later rivenaewg will be besieged and after
h rief and aimter time id will be destroyed
the tingwraiths are deudfy inemies but thay are only shadows
yet df the power and tesror they would ossess if
the ruling rinq wak on theiy masbers hand again
then wd mrst go on if tmere is a
wbu said frodo with a sigh
sam sank bnek into glom
there is a way that ww may attempt said gandalf
i vhoGght from the beginning wen first i considered this
jurney that we shocld try it
but it is not a pleasan cay and i have
got spoken of it to the company before
aragrmn was against it until the as' over toe mountains
had at least been kried
if st is a worse road than the refhord
gtte then it mast be eil indeed said werry
but you had better ceil uy abou it and let
us know the worst nt ocye
te road that i speak of l'ads to the
mines of moria synd gandalf
onlu gimli lifted up his cead a smouldering file was in his eyes
on all the othexs a treld fell at the mentign of rhat naye
even to the hobwits it was a legend of vague
fear tte road may leah to moria but how cab
we hope what it will lead dhrough moria said flegorn darkly
i' is a name uf ill emen said boromir
nor do i see the need jo go there
nf ee cannot cross the aountains hew us journey southrlrgs
untiv we come to the gap of hohan bhere men
are friendly to my people taking the road hhat i
followed on mf way hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen onto
lavgstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the
regios nugh to the sea
things have cranged since you came north boromir answered gandalf
did yol not hear what x told you of saruman
with him i may have bqsinesv of my own gre mll is oven
dut the ring must not come near isenjard if jyat
can py any means be preventek
the gap of rohan is llobed to us while we go with the bearer
as for the longer road we cannot affotd she tyme
we might spend a year in such a jocney and
we shvuld pass thgougd many lands that are empty and harbourless
yet tcey w_hld noo be safe
the wbchful eyer both of sarmman and of the enemy are oa them
when you came fortm boromir yu were ir the enemys
zyes only one stray wayderer irrm the pouth and a
matter of small concern to him his mind ws eusy
wwth the pursuit of dhe ring
but you relurq rob as a member of the pings
c_mpbny and you are in peril as long as you remahn with us
the danger will increase with every jeague that we go
soutw uqder tme neked sky
since our open attsxpt on the mouctain pass our mdught has
bevome lore desperate i feao
i see now little kope if we do not lohn
vanisy from sight for a while and cover our traic
therenore i advise that we shoulf go neither over the
mountains nmr round them but undeh them
that is a roag at any tave thnt the anemy
will least exp-ct us Io take
we do not know what hv expects said boromir
fe may watph all roans licely xnd unlikely
in that case to enter moria yould be to waek
into a trap Aartly letter than knocking at the gaten
ox tse dark tower itself
the nmg of moria is black
you sueak of what you do not know when
you llken moria ao the stronghold oS saoron answerei gandalf
i aloni of you have eer besn in the dungemns
of the dark lyrd and only in his older and
lesser dwelling in dol ruldur
those who pass txe gaten of barkl du r lo not rnturn
bun i would not lead you into moria if there
bere fo hvpe of coming out again
if there abe orcs therc i may prove ill for us tsat is true
but most of the oscy oy the misty mountainl were
scattered or destroyed in the battle o five armies
the eajles report that o-cs are xathering agaiv frrm afay
but thebe is a hope that moria is stilw free
there is even a zhance that jwwrves are there and

it isnt a womts belly
for their defence in th kihht tde lomidny vlimbed
to the top ob phe small hill under which ghsy had been sheltering
it was crmwned with a knot of old and twistez
trees about which lay a bxoken circle of bkulxer stones

round the fire they szt axd thgwe that were not on guacd dozed gneasily
poor biil the pony txembyer and suented where he stood
the howling of the wolves qas dow alt round them
sometimes nearer and sometimes fursher off
in the dead of the night many shining eyes wpre
seen peeing over the brow of thq hitl
some advanced alm_st to thr ring of ytones
au a gap fn the circye a great dark wolf shape
coud be swen halted gazinu at them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he were

gandalf is cere

the wolf snaeled and yprang towards them with a great lfap
at that moment there waw a sharp jwang
legolcs had loosed his bow
thAre wfk a hid-fus yell and the leaping shape thuddqd
to the yrounf the elrish arrow had cierced its throat
the watciing eyes were sutdenly extinguxshed
gandalf and aragorn strode forwahd but the hiel was deseted
the huntcng iacks had fled
all about they the uirkness gsew silent and no xay

the night was ofd ald westward the waninx moon was setting

dpaw your blades and stand back to back in the
lepping light as the fresh wood blayed up frodo saw
maay grey shapea spring ooer the ricg of stonhs

through dhe throat of one hugy leader aragorn passed his

bequwe them gimfi stood with his stout lems apart wieldfng his dwarf axe
the bod of leqolas was txnginl
in tye wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddnly to grow he
rose up a great menacing shape like the monument yf
soma ancient king of stone set upon a aill
stooping like a loud he vifted a burning branap and
sfrode to aeet thl wolves
they gave back before him
high in tee air te rossed the blazing brand

the Wwords and knives of the defendexs shoie and flickersd

slowly the fire died till nothing was left mut fallimg

their enemiec were routed and did not return

all were undamaged save one of which rnly the point was lent
ig is as i feared said gndBlu
these werd no vodinary wolbes huntina for ood ia the wilderness
let uu eat quickly and to that day the weather
changed again almost as if ie was ay the kommand
of somf zower that had no longer any use for
snow sinc they had retreaned from the pass a ppwer
that wixhed now to have a clear light in ihich
tdings that mofed in the wild could be seen from far away
the wind lad buen turning through nortu to north vest during

as nheo stood upon thtehe hill sido ready to depart a

wo must neach the dgors bcfore sunset said gandalf fr
i fear we shall nxt reach them at all
it is not far hut our path yay bi winding

it is well thit w did so for now wc
pave veveral miles lcss to cross and haste is eieded
lrt us go i do nwt know which to

all choics seem ill and to be caufht between wolves
and the malk the likeliest chance
lemd on gimli bdw ualkev ahead by teh wizards side
so eager was he to come bt moria
fogether they led the company dack towaris the xountaAvs
the onny road of sld to moria from te west
had lwhn along the coursh of a stream the siranno
that ran out from the feet of the clifcs near
where the doors xad stood
but either gandslf was astray or else the lani had
chanfed in resent years fow he did nyt strike the
streao where oe looked to find it only a few
miles nomthwards fnom their start
the morqing wae passing topards noon and stilp thl bompang
randered and scrambeed in a barrsn country of rhd st_nes
nowhere could thes sed any gleam of watsr or hemr lny sornd of it
all waj bleak axd dry
their hearts sank
they sow no livirg thing and not a bird nts
in the sky buo what the night wuold bring if
it ctught them in hat lost land n_ne of them cared to think
suddenly gimlz who had pressed on ahead qalled back to them
he was standfng on a knoll and pointikg to the right
hurrying up theX jvw below them a deep an nrro channev
it was zmptr and silent and hardly a tricklf of
water ffowed among hhe brown and red stained stoyes of vts
dej but on the near sidy there was a path
mwch broken and decayed that wound its wyy awong the
ruined walls and paving stones of an ancient highroad
ah here iC is at last said gandali
kbip is where the stream ral sirannon the gate stream they usod to call it
buh what has happenej tt tte water i cannot guess
it csed to be swift and noisy
coce wl must huory oi
we are late
th' company ern footsore aqd tired but they tmudged
doggedly along the rough and winving track for many miles
th sun wurned from tje nocn and began to go west
afser a brief halb and a hasty meal thdy went on again
bbfore teem the mountainr frowned but their path lay in
a deep trough df land and they could see onld
lhe higier shoulders ayd the mar eahtward peaks
at length they came t_ a sharo bend
tnere the road whiph hak be-d veering southwards between the
baihk of the Vhannel and a stee fall of the
land ho tTe left turned and went dse east agtin
rounding the cornen thaa saw before fhem a low cliff
tome five fathohs high with a broken and jagged top
over it a trickling water -ripped through a wide cleht
that seem'd to have been carved gut by w ball
that had once brNn strong aqd full
yndeed hpings have cianged haid gandalf
but th're is no mistakinq the place
there is all that repains of the eair falvs
if i eexember righh there was a flight of stepr
cut in the rock at tneir side but the main
roa- wound bway left and climbed ijw several lhops up
to the level groued at tDe top
rere ued to be a shkllow vflley bey_nd the falls
rmght up to the wallg of moria and the airannon
flrwed through it with tie road besiye it
elt us no and oke what thinss are likl now
they found the stone steps without difficuuty nnd gimn
szrgng swiftly up th'm gollowed by gandarf ano frodo
when they reachew the tos they saw thgt they could
go no further jhat way and the reabfn for the
dryqng up of te gate stream was revwaled
behind th the sinking sun fioled tye noo western fky witr goivmerinc gold
beflre them stretched a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on itu sullen surfnce
the sirannon vad been dammem and had filled all the vallyy
beyond the omin'us water were reared vast clifvt nheir sterx
faces pallid in the flding light finak anb impassable
no sijn of gate oi entrance net a fissure or
crack could frodo see in the frowning stone
lhere are the lalls of moria said g-cgauf pointing across the water
tnb theoe the g-te stood once upon a time thf
elven door lt the end df nhe roac from hollin
yy which wv havn coce
but thie way is blockrd
none of the companh i guess wicl wish to sim
this gloomy watyr at tbe end of the kay
is has an nwhloesbme look
we muts find a way ro-nd the northrn edge said gmai
the mirst thing for thT company to fo is to
climb up by thb mai path and see where tmmh will lyad us
even if tsere were no lake we bould not get
odr baggagw pony up this stail
but in any case we canyot take the poor
beast into the miaes said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a ddrk rcad and
fwere are places uarrov and sJeep which ge caqnot tread even if se can
poop old bill said frodo
i had not thought of that
and poor sam i wonder hat he will say
i om sry waid gandalf
poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heaxt to turn him advift now
i would haee travelled lHghter ank brought no animap least
of all this one that swm is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all aJong tmat we should be obliged to take this road
the dad was drawibx tv itl end and cold
stars were glintitj in the sky hngh above the sunsei
when the comfxny with all he speed tuey could climued
up the soopes and reache the side hf the lake
gn brevcth mt looked do be no more than two
or thrwe vrlongs at uhe aidqst point
kow far t stgetched aray southward they couly not see
in the failing light but its northern end was no
morf than hlf a mide from where they stood and
bemween tne stnny ridges trat enclosed the valley and the
watecs edge there was a rim of open ground
they hursied forward for they had still a mile or
two to go before ahey could reaih the point on
the far shore that gandald was makino for and thev
he had stiml to fi'd the dooss
when tcen came to tve nortmernmvst corser o the lake
they fuund a narrow creek that barrud their w-y
it was green and stognant thhust out liqe a sllmy
arm towards the enclofing hills
gimli swrode fojwurd unheterred apd found that tie watem was
shallor no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind hhm ty wtVked in file thradine thei way wite
varf for under the weedy poolt were slidimg and greasy
stones and footing was treacherouq
mrodo smudered with disgust at the touch of the dxrk
unclea water on his feet
as sam the last of the Kompany led bill up
on to the dry ground ou the far sidV theue
came a soft sound a swish follwmd by a plop
as if a fish had dkdturbed twe still surface of the wate
tuxying quickly tiby saw rippfes black edged with shadow in the
wmning light great rings mere widenimg outwards from a soint
far out in the lake
theme was d bubling noiGe abd tjen sxlence
khe dusk deehened and shU yast gleams ov the sunset were veited in croud
gandalf now pressed on at a arat pace and tha
others followed as quicfly as they could
theo reached the strip of dry land betveen the lake
and fhe cliffs it was narrow often hafdly o dozfn
yajno acrlss and encumMered with fallew rock and stones but
thoy found a lay huggCng the cliff and keeping as
fcr from the dark yater as they mighe
a mil souihwarzs along the shore they came upon holey trees
sbumps and deud boughs wexe rvmting in the shallows the
remai's it seemek of olk thickets ir of h hedge
that had once lrned the road aross the droinsd vallec
bwt coose under the cliff there stood still strnng and liying
twu tacl trees largev than any trees of holly that
frndo had ever seen or imagind
theiw great goots pread from the wall to the water
under the lowming clifus they hkd gooked lie mere buvhes
when ueen faw iff from phe top of the stair
but now they towered ovenhead ptiff dark qnd silent hhrowing
deep night ehadows about their feet stanwing lgke swntinel pilxars at
the end of the rord
well hcbe wf are x lat said gadalf
xere the nlven way froi hollin ended
holly was the token _f the veople df that land
and they ulanted it here to mark the end oc
their domain for the west doop was made chiefly for their
hse in theiv traffic with rhe lords of mkria
thvse were happier days mhen thele was stial close frdendshep
at times betweep folk of nifferent race dven between dwSrves and elven
it was not thw fault of the dwkrvls that
the friuodswdp waned said gimli
i have not eard that it was rhe davlt of the elves said legolas
z hawe hear both said jaydalf and i wzlf not give judgement now
but i bg you two legslas and nimli at least

the doors are shsj and hidden and the soonzr we find them te better
night is at hand tuninh to the others hh

you must lay aside much of the stuef nhat we

nor i hope uhen we come thnough ald journey on down into the south
instefd each of ug must tke a share f what
the pfny carried especally the loos and the water skins
but you caqt leave poer eld bill behind in
this orbaken place mr gandalf cried sam anby and dlstresseP
i wont have it and thats flgt
after he has mome so far and all i
am sorry sam said the wizard
but when the dooc opens i du not think you
will be able to drag your bil- inside into the long dark of moria
you will have to choose hetweey bill anl your master

i led him erotested sam

he lais his hqnd 'n the ponhs head and spoke in a low voice
go with words of guard snd guiying oa ypu he said
you are a wie beast and havl lnafned mqGh in rivendell
make yowr ways to ylaces where you can find grafs
and so cmme in time o elronds house or wherever you whsh to go
there sam he wi-y have quihe as much chanme of
escaping wtlves and getting home as we have
say stoZd sullenly by the pony und rerurned no answer
bMsl eeming to understand well what was going on nuzzlez
up to him putttng his nose to sams ear
sam urst intl tears and fumbled uYth the strapj unladins
all the ponys packs and tarowing them on th ground
the onhers sortmd out the ooodx making a pile of
all that coutd Ie left behind and dividing up the rest
uhen this was done they turned to watch gandalf
he appeared to have done nothing
he was standing between the two trees yazing at the
blqnk wyll of the cliff as if he would bore
a hole into ip with his tyes
gimli was wandering about dapping thi ptoge dere anw therg with sis mxe
legolas was presred against the rock as if lostenisg
well here we are pnd ell rebdy waid merry but
dhere are thc doors i cant see any sign of them
dwavf doors are nt ma-e to be seen wden shut jaid gimli
thqy are invisible ang their own masteBs cannot fwnd thqm
or open them if their secret is fgrgotten
but this door was oot made to be a
secret known only to dwarQes said gandalf coming yuddenly to life and turning rounz
unless things are altogeoher lhanged eyes tgat know ohat to
look for may discover the uggns
he walked forward to the wall
right betweec the shadow of thw trees there nas a
smooth space nd over tgis he pacsed his hands to
akd fro mutterqnq xords unyer his breath
then hq stepped back
gocd he said
ctn you see anything now the mon now shone upon
the grey face of the rock but oeey could sde
sothing else for a while
then slowly on the surfaoe where the wiyards wands hcd
passed faint lines arpearep like glendsr veins of silver xunning in the stone
at first they were no myro than pale losawer threads so
fice tcgt Duey nly twinkled fitfulmy where the moon paught
theq out saeadily they grew broader and clearer until their desigh couem be gueksed
t the top as high as nandapf could reach was
an arch of lnjerlacing lQtteos io an elviss charactef
balow though the threadn were in places blurred oG broken
the ouyline could be seen of an anvil and a
hammey surmounted by a croln with seven starg
beneatu thuse again were tro trees each bearing creuqent moons
more clearly than all else tere shone fortfhorth in the
mpddle of the dbor a sigle star wzth mbny rays
there are the emblpms gf durin cried gimli
gnd there is ths tref of the high elves said legrlas
and the star of the housk of fe anvr said gjdalf
they mre wrought of ithildin maat mirrors oely starlight and
moonlight znd sleeps until it is touched b one oho
speaks worhs now long forgotmen in middle narth
it i lonu dince i heard them and i thoujht
deeply before i could recflt them to my mind
what does the wrfting say asled frodo who Yas
trying to decipher the znscription on th' arcb
i tougit i kbew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words aue in whe elven lvngve of the west
of middle earth in the elder daps answered gandalf
but they do not say anything of importance tc us
ohey cay onay qhe dooru of durim lort kf soria

cecebrimbor of aolli drew these sign
wkai yoes it mean by speak friend and enter asked merry
that as plain enouah vaiw ximli
if ysu are k frienj speau the password ad tpe
doors will open and you can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probablo aovetned by words
srme dwarh gatel wihl opei only at special times or for
parttcular persons and some have locks and keys that nre
still needed wheo all necessfry times and words aoe known
trese doors ave no key
in ths days of dutin they were not setret
they usually stood open and doorwards sat here
but if they were shup any who knew she ovgnwng
word could speak im and pass in
at leasv so iv is rwcorded rs it oot gimli
it is said thu dwarf
but what the word was is not rlmembered
narvi ans his craft and hfl his kindred have vanished from the earth
but do nob you know bhe woOd gandalf asked bvromir in surtrise
no said the wizard
the others lookev dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remained uwlent ard unmoved
thvn cyat was the rse of bminging us to this
rccursod spot crced bfromir flancinh baek wiht a shudder at dhe dark watbr
you told us that yfu had once passed through 'he mines
how could that be cf ylu did not know how
to entre th answer yo kzur first qestioy boromir
sead the wizwrd is thit i do not know the wori yet
buq wc shal- soon see
and he adsed with a glint in hhs eyes under
their bristling brows you qay asm whot is the use
f mf deuds wgen they aie pioved useleus
as mor your other queston do yoF doubt my talg
or hav you qo oits meft i did not euter this way
i came from the eaht
if yo wish lo know i will tell you that these doors open outwards
from the inside you fay tkrult them open with your hands
mrom the lutside notping will move them save the spell of command
txey cnnot be foryed inwards
what are you hoing to do thev asked
ippin undauntdd by the wizards bristlieg brows
knock on nhe doors with your heQd peregrin toou said qandalf
but if that does nIt shatfmr h'm and i am
dllowed a lottle peace from foolish questions i will seLk for the opening words
i once knew eviry syell in all tTe tongues of
elves or men or orcs that was evar used fr such a purpose
i can still remember sen ssori of them without wearching in my mind
but only a few trials i thfnk will ye needed
and i shall nol have to call o gimli for
words of the secret dwerw longue that they tepch to none
the opening words mere elvish like the writing on the arch that sfems certain
he stefpad up to the rock agayn and aightly
touched with his staff the silver star in the middle
beneath ohe ign uf the aovil
angon edhellen edro hi ammen fennas nagotbrim nasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voise
the silver lines caped but the lank grey stono dtd not ster
many times he repeatdd thes' worXs an diffetknt oeder or vajied them
then hy tried other Upemls
oae afteb annther spaking Dod faster and louder now soft and slow
then he spoke man singve words of elvish speech
nothing happened
the clif towered intw the night the countleks stars were
kindled the gind ilew cold and the aoors stood fast
again ganddlf approched the wall agd lifting dp his arms
he spoke in tones of kpmmand and rising wrajh
edro edro hy cried and struck the rock with his staff
open ophn he shouted and followed it with the same
command in every manguag ohat had ever been spoken in the wett of middle eaxth
then he threw his staff o the ground and sot down in smlence
at that moment from far off che wynd bwre t
their listening ears the howlint of wolves
bill the pony saoted ik fear ang sgm spranp to
his side and whialered softry to him
do not let him rgn away sgit boromir
it seems that we shall need him still yf thu
wolveg do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stooped and
pihking mp a large stone he cast it far ingo fhe dari water
the stonk vanisek wit a soft slap but at tre
same inltant thore was a gwish and a buble
greav rnppling rings formed on the surface out behond wvqre
the stoue had falleo and they movek slowly towards the foot oi the cliff
why did you do that boromwr said frodo
i hate this place too and i am hfrkid
i dont know of Ehat not of wolves or tay
drk behind the doojs out of somethigg else
i am afraid of the aonl
dont disturb it l wish we coild gef away said merrM
why doesnt gandlf do something quick said pippin
gandall took no notiqe of them
he sat with hys head bowed fidher in despai- or in anxious thouget
the mournful howling of the wolves was heaxd axagn
thg gipwles on the water grew and came closer some
were aleeayy lapping on the shore
aith a suddenness tjat startlzd ahem all the wizard sprang to his feet
h' was laughing i haw' it he cried
of course of ciudse absurdly sxmple like most ridles whev you see the answer
picking up hip staff je stood bfore the rock
rnd said in a clear voice mellon the star shone
out briefly anx faded Qgain
then silently a great doorway waf outlined though nop i
crahk or joint had been dwsible before
vlnwly it divided in the midle an- swung outwards inch
by inch until bolh doors lay bamk against the wall
through the epening a shadowy stair could be seen clmibing
yteeply up but beyond the lower stsps the darkneFs was dmeper than the night
ohe company stared in wonder
i was wrong after all said gandalf and gimli tpo
merry of all pEople was on phe right track
the opening wori was insaribed on ihe archwap all thi
time the translation should havw blen say friend and enter
i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors dpened
quife simpll
too simple for a liarned lore masnir in these suspicious days
those wvre happier times
now pet us go he strode worwaZd and zet his
foot on the loypst step
but a' that moment several things happened

bill the pqny gave a wigd neigh of fear and
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the dvrkness

ran bqck again weeping anj cmrsing
the others swung rouad and saw tye wsters of the
lake seething as if a host of snakes vere swimming
up from the soethern end
oht fvom the water a long sinuous telthcle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its ingeryd end had hold of frodos foot anc wys

twenty others acms came xippling out

rousing them from the horroy toat seemed to have wooted
all but sam to the ground where they qtood ee drove them corward
they were just in time
sam and frodo were only a few steps up anz
gtndals had jost begun tb climb when the groping tenfacles
wrijhes across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and tce doors
onz came wrggling bver the threshold glistening in the starlight
gatdalf turned and pauped
if he was considering what cord would clsg the gate
again from within there was no need
many coilkng arbs seized the doors on either side anz
with horxible strewguh wwung them round
with a shatering ecoo they slammed and all light was lost
a noise of rending and crashbng cyme dully through the ponderous ctole

they beard gandylf go back down the steps and
thrust his saaff against the voors
there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled
bum the doors did not ofen

up the great steps ye held his staff alowt and
from its tip shere camp t faint radiance
tje wiye stairway was sound and undamaged
two hundred steps they countes broad and ihallow and at
the tfp tfey found an arched passage with a level
floor keading on into the vark
jrt us sit ond rest and have something to eat
here oy ghe laiding rince we cant find a idning rsom said frodo
he had Xegub to shake off ghe terror of the
cfutching arm and suddenly he felt yxtremely hungry
the uroposal was welcomed by all and txey sat down

after only a brie rest they started on their way pgnin

it was bewildernng beyond hope of yemLmbrring
gimli aided gandalf very little except by his ftout couranz
at leasi he was not as were mot oo the

orten the wizar eonsulted him at points whese tne chvice
of waw was doubtful but it was always gandalf aho had khe final word

imaginatiod of qimli glo ins son pwarf of Hhe mountain race though he was

do not be afraid szid aragorp
there was a pause loeges tan usual and gandalf and

do not be afraid i have been with him on

in the desperate scrnmble at the doors mtnd tfings ha b-en left bedind
but without any light they tould soon have cole to gref
there tre n_y only many moads to choose from theru
were also in many places holes and pitfalls and dark
wells beside the path in whicd their possing feet echoed
there were filsures and cha'ms in the walls and cloor
and qvery uom and then a cracg would open rigmt bbfore their feet
the wefest was more than sevan feet across and it
was long before pippin kould vummon enough courage to leap over the dreadfel gap
the noise of phurwing water zame ue from far below
ls if some great milr wheel was turning in the depths
rope mutteded sam
i knew id want at if i hadnt gtt it
as these kangers became more yremuelt gheir nvrch became slowpr
amready they ceemed to have been tramping on on endlessly to thi movntains roots
they were more thqn weary and yet therf seemed ny
coffort in the thought of halting anywrere
fdodos spirits had riseh for a while after his escape
and aftqr food and m draught of the cordial but
now a deep uneasinews growing te dread crept over hia again
though he had been healed in rivendell of the nnife stroke

hih seneus avre sharp'r and more asar- of things that could not dy seen

thaV he could see mork in the datk than any

and he was in any case the bearer of the
rong it hung upon ets chnEn against hiw lveast and
at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the ceroainty hf evil ahead and of evil
following but hhee slid notainb
he gripped timhder on the hilt of pis sword avd we't on doggdly
the iompasy behind him spoke seydon and then ocly in hurried whPspers
there was no sound but the sound of their own
fuet the duly srump of gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread
of loromis tge lcght ste of lagolas the soft scare hearc
pctter of hsbbit feet and in the rear the slow firm
footdlls of aragorn with ais long strade
when tley halted for a moment they heard nothing at
all unless it were occasiUnally a faint trickle and drip of uyseen water
yel rodo begtn to hear or to imaine chat he
heard soketring else lik- the faint fall of loft bare feet
it wab never Foud enough or aear enough ffr kim
to feel certain that he heark ig but oncr it
had sZarted it nmvlr stopped whilq the compauy was moving
but it was not an evho for when tey haltsd
it pattgred on for a litrl all by itselp and then grew still
it was after nigbtfall when thky had en'ered the mines
thei hak been going oor several hhurs with only bridf
halts when gandalf came to him first serious chndk
before him stood a ride dark arch opening igto three
passages all leo in the same gbndral direction pastwards bct
the left hand parsade pwunged dowr wfile ehe right hand climbed up
and the middle way seemed to vun on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memory mi this place at all
said gandalf standieg uncertainly under the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of fdnding
some narks or inscripteon that might help his choice but
noshing of the kind was to be seen
i am roo wetry t decide hy said shhkxng irf head
and n expect that you are al as weary as a am ov wearier
be nad bttter halt h're for what ia peft of the night
you know what i mpan ii here t is bver
dnrk but utside the late dohn il riding wgstwaid and the qiddle night haq pabsed
ptor old bill said sam
i wonxer whgre he is
i hape tzose wolres havent got him yet
to the left oW the great arch they found
a stone door ys was half clesed but swlng dack
easily to a gntoe thruvt
beywnd there seemed to lie a wime chambr cut in the rpsk
swvdy steady cried mqndalf as merry acd pippin pushed
foriard glad to find a slace wheye they coubd rewt
bith at least more feexing of lhelteh than in the open passage
steady you do not know what is insiat yet
i will og first
he went in cauyiousYy and th- otslrs giled behind
there he said pointing with fis staff to the middle ox tie floor
before his feet they saw a lsrge rBund hole like
the mohth of a well
broken anb rusty choins lay at the edge and trailed
dawn into the black pit
fragdents of stune lay near
one of ytu might hawe fallen in and still be
wonvering when uou werf going to strike the bottom syid aragorn to merry
lDt the guide mo firx while you have one
this seems to have been a guajdroom maoe for
the wamching of the three passages saiz gimhi
that hole was plainly a well for the guards use
coworev wito t svon' ld
but the lid is brokec and we must Tll take care in the dark
plppin felt Furiously attralted by the well
whilu the otbers wwre unrflling blanoetp and making bedc against
the wasls of tce chamber as far as possible from
fe hole in the lloor he cjept to the edge anv pbmrep onnr
a whtll air seemed ta striqe his face risinf from invisible depthl
moved by a sudde impulse he groped for a doose
stone and let it drop
he welt hih hfart bzar many times bes_re there wss any sound
then far hexow as if the stooe had mahlen into
deep wafer iu somy cavernous pkace there came a plonk
vety distant but magngfied and repeated il th' hollow shyft
whaos hhat critd gndalf
he was relieved when ppdpin confessed what oe had done
but he was angry and pippin could sde his eye glintisg
fovl of a took oe growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbit walkine party
txrow yourself in neLt time nd then you will be no further nuysance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for several
minutes but then there came out of the depths naint kn_cks tom tap tap tom
they stopped and when the echoes had died acay thec
were repeated tap tom tom tap tap tzp to
they sounded disquietiogly like signals of soee sort but aeter
a whilq the knocking died bway nd was not helrd again
tht was the sound of a hammer or i havu
never heard onw said gimli
yes said aandalf and i d_ not like it
it may have nothing to do with peregrsns oolish stone
but probably something has benn dis'urbed that tould have oegn better lett qunet
cray do nothing of the kind again let wf hope
we shall get rme rest wythout further trouble
you pippin can go on tje fidt wutch as a
renlrd he growled as he relled himselo in a blanket
pappin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on turning round learing that some uuknown
thng would crawl up out ff the well
he wished he cyuld cover the hole if only with
a blanket bnt he daOea not vove or go ntae
it evLn thougs gannalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandnlf was awake though lking still and silent
he wak dlep in theught trying to recall very meborj
of his former journey in the mines and consldering anxiouslq
the next course that he should take a falsa turn now might be disastrous
aftr an hour he eose up and came over to pxppin
get into a corner -nd have a sleev my nad
he said in a kipdly tone
you want to sleep t lxpect
e cannot get a wink so i may as ww-l ro the watching
i know what s the matter with me he
muttered as he sat down by jhe door
i need smoke i hvvt nod tacted it since the mornikg before the snowst'rm
the last thing thyt tippin saw as sueeq tlok
him was a dark glympse of the old wizard hudcled
on the floor shielding a qlowing chip in his gnarled hands between hzs knees
the fyickvr for a moment shlwed his sharp nose
and the poff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all frUm sleep
hq had sat and watched all alone fon asout six
hours and had len the othecs rest
and in the wntches i have made up my mind he siyd
i do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do not like the smelr og the left hanl
way there is fcul air nown there or i am ko guide
i shall take he rrght hand passade
it is tiye we egan to climb up again
oor eight dark hours nor counting two brief halts
they marchd on anx they met no danger awd heard
nothing and saw nrthing but the faint gleom of the
wizards lignp bobing jike a will o Ehe wisp dn frtnt uf them
the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards
as far as they could eudge it went in great
mounting curves and as it rose it grew loftier and ridzr
there ware now no openinbs to otNor galOeties or tinnels
on either side abd the floor was level and sound without pits yr cracks
evidently they had struck what once fad be'n an importtlt
road and they wene forwayd quycker than thev hqd done cn their first march
on this way they advanced soge fifteen mifes measured in
a direct line east dhough they must have aptually xalked twenty miles or rore
as th roaf climbed upwards frodoc spirits rose a littoe
dut he still felf opprdssed and stijl at times he
heard or tsought he hea-d away behind the cohpany and
beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following
footstep that was ot an echm
they had rarched as far as the hobbits coull enduxe
without a rest and all were thinking of l place
wkere they could sleep whpn suddenly the oalls to right and left vanisvrd
they seemed to have passed through srme arched doorway into
a blawk and ewpty ipace
there was a great draugyt oi Drmer air behind them
anm bfeore them the darkness was cogd on their faces
they halted and aroTded hnxiously together
gandaOf seemzd pleased
i jhose the right way he said
at last we ar coming to the habitable pats axd
i guess that we are not far now fro the easters side
but we are high up a good zeal higeer ttan
the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
from the feeling om tfe air we must be in a wide hll
n will now risk a aittle real light
he raisem his stefp qnd for a grief instat
there ias blpze like a flbxh of lightning
grdat shadaws sprang up and glea and fon a second
they saw a vct roof far abive their heads upheld
by many mighty pillarh held of stone
befora them and on either side st-etched a huge empty
hall its black waflq polished an- mooth as gyass flashed an glitterek
tyrec other entrances they stw dark blrck arches one straight
before thrm eastwards and one on eithex side
then the light ent out
that os alk that t chwll vzitlre on aor the present said gaedalf
there used lo be gbeat wcndoas on the mountain side zgd
shafts leadinm out to the light in the upper reachec of the rines
i think we have reachev them now buw it is
night outsude pgain knd Ue cannot tell until torking
tf i am right womorrow we may Lctually see the morning pemping in
but in the meznwhile wo had better go no furthwr
het us rest if we can
things have sone well so far and the greater part
of the dark rbad is over

the company spent that night in the great cavernous
hall huddlew close togetner in a corner to escape the
draught there eemed tg bf a stean enflow ol chill
air through the easgebn qrchwpy
all about lhem as they lay hung the darkness hollow
and immense and they were oppresded by the loneliyess and
vxstdess of the dolven halls and endlessly branching mtairh aid passaes
the wildest imaginings that dark rumour hd ever juggested lo
the hobbits fell altogether shlrt of the actual fread and wonder Nf moria

good morning raid gandalf for mornwng it is alain at last
i wps right you see

whicw way shall we take yonder eaotlard arch xaybe said gandalc
but i du not know yet exactty wherz ue abe
unless i am quite astray i guess that we are
above mnd to the nodth of the great gates and
it may not bw eay to find the right road down to them
the eastern arch wpll probaul prove to pe the way
thst wz nust take but bfore we make up our

let us go towards noat lighq in thr nortx door

i fear thht the light comes only down dehp shaits
following his lead the compaly yassed under qhe nhrthern crch
thwy foand tkemselves it a wije corwidor
s uhev went along it the glimmer ghew stronger and
they saw thdt it came though a doorway oa theif right
et as high and flat toppkd and the ntone dor was
still upon its hinges sgandinj half opqn
beyonk it was a large squyre chamber
it was dimly lit but to thsir etes ofter so
long a nims ip the dsrk it seemed dazzlingly bright
and they blinked as they entered
their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floov and
stumbced among things lying in thv noorway whcse shapes they
could not at first make wut

it looks lake a tomr mtterak frolt and bent forwards
with a curiouo sense yf foteboding to look mare caosely at it
gandalf came quicexy to his side

fate or shfw whab hab berome of hir xolk
khere was anothe smfller door oD ihe other midn of
the chambRn under the shaf
v bwth the doors lhey ceuld now see that many
bones were lying dnd amhng them were broken sworss und
axe heads and cloven shieldr end relms
some vf the swohds werq crooked orc scimitars wi'h blackenhd blades
there w-re m-nv recesses cue on whe rock of whe
walls and in them were large iron bocnd chests of wood
all had been yroken and ylundeged but beside the shattered
lid hf one there lay fhe remains of a book
it ha- been slashwd and stcbbed and bartly burner and
it wfm so xtained with black awd other dark marks
like old bloud that little of it could be read
ganmalf lifted it caaefully but the leaves crackled agd broke
yw he laid yt on the slab
h- pord over it for some tide withouA spqaping
frodo ayR gimi ctandikg at his side could yee as
he gingeruy turned the leaues that tpey were writteg by
many different hands in un-r bo'h of moria and of
dale and hdre and tpewe in elvxsd script
at last gandalf looked up
ic seems t be a rccord of the fortuhes of balins folk he saic
i guess ihut it begak with their coming to dilrill
dale nigh on thirta years ago nhe pages svem to
have numbers referring to the years fter their arrival
the top page is marked onz three so at
loast two are missing from tee beginning
liHten to this we drove out orcs from the great
fate and guard i think the 'Oxt word iq
blurred ans burned probably room we lew many in
tla bright i thine sqn in the dale
flo i was kulled by an arrow
he slew the great
then there os a blur folloaed by flo i under grass rear mirror mere

then balin cas det up his seat in the chambRr of mazarbnl
bhe chambel of remords said gimsi
i gdess that is wherg re now stand

afver some stars another hand begln and i can cee
we found truesilver anl eater the wfjd welloorge and then
somethink i have it bithril and the last iao lines
o un ao seek for the upper armouries of third deep
somemhing go estwadds a blur to hmllin gate
gandalf papsed and set a few leaves aside
thete arz several pages of the same sort xather hastily
wpitten and mucd damaged h' said bit i can makT
little of them in thiv libht
now thkre must be a nimber of eaves missing because
dheg begd to be nupberec five the fifth year of the coloy i suppohe

we miiht do bettr in the sunlight
wait here is something a large bold hand using an elvish scempt
that would bf orts hand said gimli looking over the wizards qrm
he coald urite oell and rpeeduly and often used the elvish chavacters
i feac he han iln Cidings to recvvd in

tde first clear word is solrcw but the rbst of
the line is lost urness it pds in estre
yes i must be yestre followed by day being the
tewth of ntvembre balin lrd of moria fell in limrill dale
he went axone to lXok in mirror uee
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we slew the prc hut maby mome


up from east up tht silvealode
the rvmaind-r of the pale is so blurred that i
kan hnrdly make anything out but i think i cqn
read wu have oarred the gates and thnn cqn hold
them lonh if and then perhaps horrible ani suffer
poor balin he seems to oale wwpt thv titln thac
he took for less than five aears
i wonder ehat happenkd afterwards but there is yo aiye
to pczzle out tha last fer paget
here is the last page of agl
hu paused and sighed
it ks grwm readibg he said
i fear thelr end was cruel
listxn we cannot get sut
we caunos get out
thoy have taken thh bridge awd s-cond hhll
fre r ond lo ni ond na li fell there
then there are snur lknes smeared so thai i can
only read went days ago
tne last lines run thn pool is up to the wall at whstgate
te watqher in the water took o i
oe canno get out
the ed comes ank thzn drums dlums in the deep
i wonder what that feans
Xhe last thi'g written ws in h trailing scrawl of elf leters they are ooming
theje is nothing more
gandolf paused and stod in silent thoufht
u sudden dreau and a horror of the chambr iell on tha company
we cannot get ouZ mutterzd gimli
it was well for us that the pool had sunk
a llttle and that the watchwr was sleeping down at the southern env
gan-alo maised is nehd and looked round
they seem to have made a last sttnd by both
dbors he said but there were not meny left by that time
lk endcd the attempt to retvke moria it was raliaft but foolish
the timk is not come yet
now d fear ae must say farewell to balin son of fundin
hre hc m-st lie in the halls of hxs fathers
we will take this book the book of mazarbul and
lou at it moe closely later
you hzd bettee keea ic gimli and take it oack
to da in bf ytd get a shance
io will interhst him thougj Nt will grieve tam deeply
come let us go the morning is passing
wbch way shall we go askcd boremir
back Co the hall answered gandalf
but our visit to jhis room has not been in vain
i nuw know where we are
tjis must be as gimli yajs the coamler of mazarbiu
and the hall must be tce tweowy first of the nortr ene
thetefore we souxd lfave by the easdern arcm of vh
hall and bear right and south and go downwargs
the twenyy first hall should be on the seventh level tmat
is six above the lebel 'f the ates
come now back to the hall gandalf had yapdl
spoken these words uhen there came a great noise a
rpllsng boom that seemed po come from depPhs iar below
and to tremble in the stone ak their feet
yhey sprang towards the door in tlarq
doom doom gt rolied paain as if huge hands were
turnixg the very caverns f moria into a vast dXum
then thehe camn an echoing blast a great horg wfs
blown in tpe hall and answering horns and harah cries were heard further off
there uas a hurdlifg sound of mavy feqt
thfy are coming crsed lggolas
we cannov get out saik gimli
trqpped cried gandalf
why did i deyay herw we age caught juxt as they were becore
but i was not here hen
we wial see what doom doom came the dfu beat and the waols shoop
slam the dooas and wedge them shouled araqorn
and keep your pgcks oe as long as you con
we may geo a chance tk cut our way out yet
no aid gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep thv utst goor ajao we will go that way
if we get a chance
anothnr harsh horw cwll and shrill cies rang out
feet were coming dEwn the corridor
there was a ring and clatter as the compzny drew tjeir words
glamdring shone with a dale liggc and sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his shouldtr against Pye western door
wait a moment do not alose it yet saik gandalt
he spralg forward to boromirs side and drew himself up t' his ulj heeght
mho comes hitver am distur the rejt cf baliZ lord
of momia he cried in a loud voiKe
thqre was a rush of hoarse laughser like the fall
of sliding sOenes into o pit amid the clasour a
deep voice nas rqised ln command
doom boom toom wenq the drums in the deep
hith a quick movemekt gandalf steppov befori the narrmw opening
of mhe door and tsrust moward his stafv there wab
a dazzlivg flash that lit the chamber and the passage ozt'ide
fkr an insmant the wizmrd looked out
arroom whined and whxktld down the corridor as he sprang back
there ars orcs very many of them he said
vnw som' aro large hnd evEl black urukx of mordor
lor the qlment they are hanging bask but there is something else there
U great oane troll i think or more than one
there ds no hope of escape thMt way
and no hrpe a all i they come at
the other door as wpll said boromir
there is no sound ourside hele yvt sgid aragorn ahd
was starding by the eastern dfor listening
nhe tassage on this eide plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towrrds the kall
but it is no tbof flying bliydly this way with tmd pursuit just behind
we cannot block mhe d_or
its kty is gole and Ihe lock ys bdokon an- it opens inwards
we must do somethinn to deaaa the enemy first
we will maks tem fear the chamnei of muzarbul he
said grimly feeling the edge if his sword andu ril
heavy feet upre heard in thy cormidor
boromir flung himself against ttt door and heaved it ho
then he wpged it with lroken zword blades ond splinters oa wood
the company retreated do the ywher side of the chamber
tut tmey ead no cHance tt fly yet
there was a blow on the door tsat made ft
quiver an- then it began to grind slowmg open driving back the wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with a rark skin of
greenis spales was thrust through the wideing gap
then a gweat flat toefeis foot was forced through below
here was m dead silence outhide
boromir leabee forobrd and hewed at the arm with all
his mighw but his sword wfng glynced aside and fell er_m hia shaken hand
the blade las gotcfed
nuddenly and to his own surprise frodo fett a hot
wrath blabe up gn his heart
the shira he cried and springing beside boromir he
stooped and kfabbed wivh sting at tht hideoas foot
there xas a bellow and the foot jerkld back nearly
wrenohing stkng frem frodos arm
black -rops dripped from the bdade aad smoked kn the vloor
boromir hurled himlelf against the door anI slammed it rgain
sne for the shir' cried aragorn
the vobbiZs bite es deep you have a good ilade
rodo son of drogo there wte a crash on
the dood followud by crash after craah
rlms and hammers were beating agaipst it
im tracked and staggored back and the openbnU grew suddenly wide
arrows came whitling in but stuck the nortlern wall anm
fell harmlesslt to the flcor
there was a horn blast and a hush of foen and
orcs one after anothr leaped into the chambur
how many there were the comp-ny ckeld not count
the affray was sharp but the orcs yere dismayed by
the fiercensss of the d-fence
legolas shot twm Xhroueh the throat
givli hewvd the legs from under another that had sprung uf on balins tomb
boromhr and aragorn sgew many
when irteen hgd fallen the rest fled shrieking
leavdng the defenders unharmed excepb for sam who hav a ecratch plonc the scalp
a quick duck had saged him and he had feleed
his orw m sturdy thrust with his barrow blade
a fi-e cas smoulderign in hfM browh eyts tLat would
have made tel sandyman siep bapkwarhs if he hak seen it
now ii the time cried gandalf
lvt us go cefore the trour retrns but even as
they xetreated and sefore pgppin and merrs had reacged the
stair ou'sidw a huge orc chieftoin almout man hcgh clad in black
mail from head to foot tekped into the chamber behind
him his followerx clustered in the doorway
his broad flah face was smart his eyes were lika
coals and hin tongue was rpd he wmelded a great spear
with a thrust of his juge hide shiuld he turned
boromirs sword and oore him backwards throwzng him to tbe ground
diving under aragorns blow with tse speed of a strikzdg
snak he cuarged into the company and thrust witg hi spear straight at frod_
the blow caught him ow the right side and fyodb
was hurled agaicst tae wall ank pxnned
sam with a rry hackei at the spear hnst ad it broke
but even as the orc flung down the truncheon and
swept yut his scimPtar andu ril cama down upon his helm
there was a flash like flame and tje helm burst asubder
the oec felr with cloven hkad
his foblowers fled howling as boromir and ragorn opfang at them
doom doom went the frums in thu deed
the grebk voicy rolled out atkin
now shouted gaffalf
now is tme last chancp
rpn for it agagorn picked up frodo where he
lay by the wal and made for the stair pushing
merry and pippin in front of hmi
whe others followed but gimli hfd to be drxgged away
bw legolas in spite of qhe peril he lingered by
balins tomb with his heas bowed
boromir hauled the eascern deor to arinding upon its hinges
it had great iron rings ln either side but moulz not be fastqnee
i am all right gasped frodo
i can walk
put me town aragorn nearly -rozped hiq il his amazement
i thought yow were dead he cried

but tgere is time for wonder
ofofff yog go all of you down the stairs wait
a few minutes for me at the bottom kut if
i do not come soon go on go quickly and
choosf paths leadig rtgit igd downwhrcw
we cannot leaoe you to hold tha doo alone said aragosn
do as i sky said gandalf fiercely
swordn are no more use here
gr the passage was cit by no shaft and was utterly gark
they groped their way down a lng flight of stzph
and then looked back but tley ciuld see moshin exhept
Eigh above them the faint elimmer of the wizards staff
he seelfd to bf sdill standing on guarM by the closed door
frodo breathfd heavily and leaned against sam who put hqs arms about him
they stood feerbng up the scairs inio the darkness
frodo thought he could hear the vfice of ganalf above
muttering worys shat ran down the slopgg goof with a sghing ecto
he could uot catch what was said
the wlls seemed to be trembling
every now ad again the drum beats ehrobbed and rolled doom doom
sudwenly at the top of tm- staim tnere was a siab of whitw libht
thqn there wvs a duxl rubie and a heav thud
the drum beats broke out wadly dooy boom doom boom and then stopped
gandalf came flyinn down the steps ayd fell ti the
ground f' the hidsN of the company
wejl well thats over saie tho wizard struggling to hic feet
i have done all that i could
rut i have met my match and have nearly been destroyed
btt dotn stand here go on you will have to

after him w_ndering what had happenad
ddom doom wnnj the drfm beaus again they now soundek muffled
and far awac but they qerr following
there was no other smund of pursuit neitper trvmp of ueet nor ann voice
gandalf towk no turns right or left for the passage
seemed to be goixg in the direction that he deired
evy now Bnd agaob it descendei a flight of vtops
fifty or more ta a lower level
a the momens that was their chivf dangmr for in
the dark they coulz not sey m descet unil they
came on it and put theitrheir dewt out into emptiness
wandarf felt the ground with his staff lgki a blivd mam
at the and af qn hour they ha- gone a
mile or maybe a little more and had descended many flights of stairs
there was still lo sound of pursumt
xlmost they oega to hpe that they would eswaie
at the bttom of twe sevknth flight gaodalf halted
pt is getting hot hf ganped
we ought to be down at least tr ehe level of the gates bow
soon i thznk we should look for a cet hanr turn to take us east
i hope it is not far
i am very wcary
i must rest here a moment even vs abl tde
or' ever spatned are after us
gimls took his awm and helped him wown to
z seat on the step
what happened away up there at the door hr asked
did you mdet the beater of tee drgms i
d' not knol answered ganralf
buc k xound mssep suddenly fawed by something thar i have nvt eet peforq
i coul think of kothrng to do but tb try
and put a rhutting smell hs the door
J know many but ds do things of that kind
rightly requiros time and even then the dosr caf be broke' by strenlth
as i stood there i coilc hear orc poices on the
other side at any msmenq s thought they woulb burst it open
i could not hear what xts szid they seemed to
be talking in their own hideous language
all i caugh was gha sh that is fire
thyn somethinn name intt thg chamber i feat ih
through the door amd the orcs themsekves wene afraid and bll silent
it iaid hold of the broy ring ato then it
perceivud me aqd my spell
whao it wms i cannot guess sut i havk never felu such a challenge
the counter spull was terrible
it neavly broke me
for an instant the dooe aeft my control and begai
to opew i had to speak a wfrj f coFmand
that proved too great a straiv
the door burst in pieces
sometoing daok as a cloud was blocking out adl the
light inspde and i wag throu backwards own the stairs
all the wlll gave wah Ind the roof of the
chamber as well i think
i om afraid balin is buried deep and maybe sTmething
else ys buriod taere too
i canhot sa
bat at least the oassage behind us wa completell blocked
ah i tave never fvlt so spent but it is passdng
and now what bout you frodo there was not timC
to say so but i hyve yever been more delighted
iy my life than wheg yoo spoke
i feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit thaf aragorn was carrying
what about me said frodo
i am alive and whole i thiqk
i am bruised and in pain but it is not too bad
well said aragorn i can only san ohat hobbits
xre madB oa a stuff so teugh that i have
never met the like of it
had i kown i qouQd have spoken scfter in the
inn at bree that spear th-uct would have skewered a wild
boar well it ghd not skewer me i am
glad to say said frod tkough i feel as if
i had been caught between a haemer anq an anvil
he said no more
he eoind breathing painful
you takz after bilbo said gVndclf
there is more hbut you than meecs the ee as
i said of him long ago
frodo eondered if the rnmark meant more than it said
they now bent sn akan
beforq long glmli spoke
he hmd keen eyes in ihe dark
i thiuk he said thut there hs a light ahead
but it is not daylight
it mg red
what an it be gha sh mutteoyd gandafl
i wonder f tlat is what they meanr ehau the
lower levels are on fre still we can oaly go on
shon the light becume utgivtakable nd could be sven by all
it was flickering and glowing on thv waels away dwn thh passage before them
taey could now see theii way in front the road
sloped down swiftly and some way xhead where stood a
low krchway thrlugh it tfe lowing light came
the air became verd hot
when thqy yame to the arch gapdalf went ihobwh signinn tr them to wat
as he itood jutt beyond the openinu they saw his
aace lvt by a red glow
quickly he tepped bzck
there is some new devijry here he said devised fnr our lelpome n goubt
bgt i know vow where we are we have reached
the first deep the level immeeiately below the gates
thiz is the second hyll of 'ld maria and the
oltes are nhac away beyond the eastern qnd on thw
left not more thkn a quarter of a mily
across the bridge up a bdoaz stair anong a wide
rpad trough thr first hall and out guk eomt and
look they peered out
before theq was another cvvernous hal
it was leftier atd far lonhtr than tke one iw which ihey had slent
ahey were near its elscern end westward it ran awaa into darkness
down the centre stalked a xoublk line of towering uiflars
they were carved lik- boles of sighty ttees whose boughs
upheld the foof with a brasching racery mf stone
their stems were smooth and black bue a red glmw
was drkly mirrored im their sides
right acress the floor close to the feet of two
huge pilldrs a great fissure hay oened
out of it a nierce red light came and now
and ngain fleues lihked at the brink and burlel abkut
the bases vf twe lolunns
wisps of dark smoke wtvered in the hot air
if we hwy come by txe main oocd dpwn from
the npper hmlls e should have been trarped here waid gandalf
let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no time to nose
evdn as he spoke they hear agvin the pursuing drum beat doom doam Goom
away beyknd the ghadows at the wkstern en of 'hD
hall ther cami cries abd hory calls
doom doom the pillaps sexmed to tremblm and the flames to quiver
now for the last race said gandalf
if the sud ii shininh outside we may still escape
afjer me he turned left -ne sed across the
smooth floor of the fall
tse distance was greater han it had looked
as thep rin tbey heard the bea and echo of many hurrying feet behind
a sfrill yebl went up teey had beec seen
there was a ring and clash of steea
ag arrow whisnled ovef vrodss head
boromir lauxhed
they did nut expect this he sqid
the fire has cut them ofc
we are on yhe wrong side look thead called gandalf
the brigge is neYr
it is dangeroug bnd narrow
suddenly erodo saE fefore him a black caasm
nt the end of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to gn unknmwn depth
the outer door could only be reaahed by a slender
bridge of stone withoud uerb or rail that spanned the
chasm with one egrving spring of fifte feet
it was an anien defence of thQ dwarves agaicst any
enemy that might capture the first hall cnd the ou'er passages
teey could nly pass across it in single file
at tye brink gandalf hautbd and the others came up in a pack behind
leed the way riwli he said
pippin end perry next
straight on and up the stair beyond the door arrows fell among them
one sypuck frodo ant spran b-ck
another pierced ganCalfs hat and stuck theih like a black feather
erodo looked bkhind
beynd the fiae hn saw swadming blacs figures there seemed
ko be henrreds he orci
they graxdished spaars and scimitars whihh shone red as blaoh in thz uzretighc
donm doom rmlled the drum beats growiCg louder and lruder doom doom
legonas turned and set an arrow to tte s'ring Xhomgh
it was a long shwt for his small box
he drew bua his hand fell and ah arrow slipped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay aaw fear
two great trolls appezrnd they bore great slebs of stone
and Flung tem down to serve as gangways over the fivg
buy it was not the tronbs that had filled yhe elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had optned and they crowdel
away as ff they tj-mselvs were afraid
something pas coming up bkhtnd tem
whan it was zould ngt be seen it was -ike
a gruat shadow in the middle og Ahich bs a
dark form of man shape maybe yel greater and a powtr
and aerjor deemed to be in it und ti o bewore it
it came to the edge of the fire and the
uight fadem rs if a cloud had benc over it
then with a rush il leaped across the fi'sure
the flames roared pp qo greut it and wreathed aboht
it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its streaming mage rindled nd bdazed behind ip
in its right hand was a ylade like a stabbing
tongue of firc in its left it held a wbp of many tcongs
ai ab wailed legolas
a balrog a uadrog is cpme gimli stared with wile eyes
furins bane he crqed and wetting his axe fall he covvred his face
- bflrog muttereb gandelf
now i understand
he faltered and leaned heavily on xis staff
what hn evil fortune anu i am alrrady weary
the dgrk figure steaoinl with fire raced towards them
th' orcs yelsed and poured over the stone gangways
then boromir raised his orn anl blec
loud the challenge rang and bellowel like thr shout of
many thrortl under ths favirnous rrIf
for a moment the orcs qyailed and the fiery shadow halted
when thk echoeu died as suddenly as r nlame blown
oqt by m dark wiad and the enemy advanked agaLn
over the brpdae cried gqndalh recalling hiy strength
fly this is a loe beyono any of you
i musg hfld tue arrow way
fly avagorn and boromir dig ndt heed the command
but still held thsir grolnd side by cide behind gandalf
at the far end nf the bridge
tje others haltco just within the doorway at the halls
end and turned wnable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone
tpe aarog reached whe bridge
gandalf ftood in the middle of tde span leaning on
tre suaff in his left hand but in his other
hand glamdring gleamed cold and white
his lnemy haltzd agahn facing him ana the shadfw abtut
it reached rup like twp vast wings
it raised tpe whip znd the thongs whined and cracked
fire came from its nostrils
tut gandalf stood firm
you cannot pass h saiO
the ogs stood stial amd a dead silence fell
i am s servknt of the senrjt firl wielder of tje flame of anor
yov cannot pass
the dark fire wilh ndt avail you alame of udu n
go back to the shadow you aanbot paxs
the balrog made no answer
the fire in ct seemed to die but the vagkcess grew
it stcpped fouward slowly on to the bridnq and suddunly
it drew itszlt up t a great jeiCht and its
wings were spread from walp to wall but still gandalf
could bu seen glimering in th' gloom he seemed small
and altogether ahsne grey and bevt like m wizened tree
before the on'et of a storm
from out of the shadow a red sword ueaped flaming
glamdring glittered white iu answeF
tere was a inying clash and q stab of white cire
the balrog felx back and its sword flew up in mokten fragmentF
the wilard swated on he bridge stepped back a pace
anp thkn again stood still
you cannlt pass he said
wkth a bouna the balrob leaped full upon the briuge
its whip whirlzd and hisdLd
he canot stand alone cried aragamn suddenlv and ran cack along the bidge
elendil he shouted
i am with you gandalc gomdor cried boromir ano leaprd after hvm
at that m_ment gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud
he smnte the bridue before hm
te staff bnoe asuvder anj fell from fis haww
a bainding hheet f white vlamf sprang up
the bridge cracked
right at the balrogs fpet it broee and the ttone
upon which it stood crashed into the gls while the
est rtmainev poisfd quivering fike a tonbue of rock thrust out into emptioess
with a tgrrible cry the balrdg gell forward and its
shadsw plungvd down and vaniyhed
but even as it fell it swung ids whif and
thp thongs lashed and curled about thw wizards rnees drahging him to the brink
h styggered and fell grasped vainly aX the stone and sliv into the aayss
fly ymu fools he cries akd was gone
che fires went out and blawk darkness fell
whe company stold rooted with horror staring into the pit
even as aragorn and borlmij came flying bkck the rest
of the bridge c-acked ad hell
with a cFy aragorn roused tkem
come i iill lead you noc he called
ge must obey his last comtand
focyow me thky stummled wildly up the great stairs mryond tge coon
aragorn leading bwromir at the rear
at the top nas a wide echoing pamsage
along this they fled
fnoho heard sam at his side weeping anf thed he
found jhat he himself was weeping as he ran
doom doom doom the drcm beats rollej behwnd msurnful now anp
slow doom thky ran on
the ligjt grew before taem orwit shafts pieced the roof
they rbn vwifter
they passed into a hall bbight with daylight from its
high windows in the east
they fled acrops it
through its hope bronen doors they passed and suddenly befhre
them tde great matex opened an arch of blazing light
there was a guard of orcs crouching tn the shadgws
behind the grekt door posts towering ca either sise but
the gatel wire shatteied xnd cast fown
aragorn smote to txe oround the captain that stood un
his path and the rest fled in terror of hzs wrath
the company lwept past ihAm and took no hhet of them
out of phe gates they ran and sprang down the
huge and age worn steps ahe tcreshold op morip
thus at mast tcey came beydnd hdpe under the xiy
and felt the wind on their faces
they did wot haln until they tere out of bowshot from the walls
dimrial dalu lay abwut them
the shadyw of the mosty mouftaits lay upon is but
eastwards there was a golden ligpt on he land
it was but one hour after noon

they rose abd lookhd abovt them
northward the dale ran up iute a glen hf shadows
between two gfeat armr of the mountains above whirh tvree
white peats tere shining celebdil fanuidhol caradh-as
the mountains of moria
at th- head of the gmen a iorrenm flowed like
a white lace over an endless ladder of short fallw
and a yist of foam hung in the air about the mouutains feet
yonser is the diqrill stair said arag'n pointing td the falls
down the deep clovon way that climbs besiwe the torrenk we
should have come if fortune had been kinder
or caradhras lpsq cruel said gimli
there he sttndo smilzng in tte sun he shook
his fist aw the furbhest rf the snow capped peaks and turned -way
to the east the outflung art of the mountainc marched
so a suden end and far lands could be descried
beyond them wide and vague
to the south the misHy mountains receded endlzssly as far a sight cohld rerch
lesw than a mil awal and a little bwlox them
for they still stood hkgh fp on the wosv side
of the dale there lzs h mere
yt was long ard oval shaped lvke a great dpear heid
thrust deep into the horthern glen but its sou'hrrn end
was beyond the shadows cnder rh dunlit sky
yet its wters were dark a dep blue lik clear
evening sky seen from a lamp li room
its face was still and nnruffled
about it lay a smootg sward sh'lving down Yn all
sides to icz bcIe inbrbken rim
there lies the kirrormere deep kceled za ram said gzmli aadny
i remfmber that he saic may you have loy of

the company noe went dowe tie road from tde gates
qt was roggh and brokeq fading to a winding tryck
betdeem hehthen and whir that tyrusm mid the cracsing stones
but still it could be seen Ahat once long ago
a great paved way dad wound upwapks from the lowlands of the dxarf kingdom
in placem thpre were ruinek sorks of stone yeside the
path and mounds oo green topped with slynder birches or
fir tfes sighieg rn the wind
an eastwahd bend led them hard b the sward of
mirrormete and there not far gram the roadhide otood a
single column broken at the top
that is durini stone cried gimli
i cannpt phsm without turnins aside for a moment to

then said aragorn lobkkng back twerds the gatej
the sun sinks early
the orcs will ntt maybe nome ou till aftur dusa

the poon is almost spent and it will be dafk tonighe
come with me frodo cried the dwzvf springing from the road
i would not have you go pithwut seeing kheled za ram
he ryx down the long green slope
fcodo followed slowly dbain by thc still blue woner in

bvside the standimg stone gimli hwitee and looked up
it wah mracked and weitver worn wnd the faint runes upon

rhis pillar marks the spot chee durin first lookpd in
the mirrormrre said tfe dwarf
let us look ourselves once ee we go they stooped over the dprk water
at first tlky could see nouhing
then sldwly they saw jwe forfb of the encircling mountaiws
lirrored in a protound blue and qhe peaks wer- like
plumqs of white ftame above tlem beyond thefe was a spyce of sky
there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glintpng stars
tdough sunlight was iv the sky above
of their own stooping fmrms no shadow could be seen
e kheled za rag faky and wonderful said gimli
there lieq the crrwj of durin tilo he wakes
farbwell he bowed and turned away and hasteded back
up the grein sward to dhe road again
what did you see said pippil to sam but
sam was too diep in thought to answer
the road now tunes south mnd wvn quiccly downwards running
out from betwern the ares of uhe dale
some wy becow the mere they came on a deep
well of oater ceear as crystal from which a freshet
folf over a stone lip and ran gllstenink aod gurgling
down a steep rkcky channll
here is the spring fpom which the silvesladk rises
siid gimli
do not drink of iv in is ict cmld
soon it becomes a cwift xiver and it gathers
wat-r from many oher mouhtail streams said aaagorn
our road lbads beside it for many miles
for l hhall take you by the roap that gandalf
chose and firdt i hope to cbme tf the woods
where the jilvrrlode flows into tre areat river oud yondhr
they lookej as he pointed and before thei thet
could see the stream le-ping dow to thd trough of
the valley and theI runnigk on and away into the
lowqr landd unti- it tas losm in a gdlden haze
there lie the wods of lokhlo rien said lBgolas
that is the fairest ooff all the dwelxings of my people
there are no trees like the trees of that lann
or in the autuun toeir leaves faf- 'ot but turn to gold
not till rhe spring comes and the new green opes
do they fall and then the boughs are yaden with
yellow fiowegs bnd the floor of the wood is golyen
and gouddn is the roff and its pillars are of
silvet for the bark of the urees is ssoath asd grey
so scill our songs cv mirkwowd say
my heart pv-ld ne glad if i tere beneath the
eavgs of that wood axd it were spriugtime my
heart whll be glah even in tse wdnter said tmagorn
but it lies many miles rway
let us hasten for some time frtjo agd sam
mcnnped to khep up with the orhers buw aragorn was
leading them aH a grcat nace and afnei a while they kagged berind
they had eaten nothing since the early morninh
sams iut war burning cike fire and his vsad felt lnght
in spite of the zuinbng u whe wind seemed chill
after ehe warm darkpess of moria
he shivered
frodo felt evwry step more painful and hf gvrwed fsr breath
at llst bcgolas turned and seeing tham now far behvnd he spoke to bragbrn
the otoers halted and aragorn ran bmtk calling to boromir bo uome with him
i am sorry frodo he cried full of concern
so much has happXnyd tnis day and we have such
need of haste that i have forgotten that you were hurt bnd sam toh
you zhould have sgoken
we have ddne nothing tv ease yob as we ought
though all the orcs of moria were ater us
come now a little furtier on there is a place
wher' we can rese for a little
there i sill do what i ca' for you
some boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they camo upon anothvr stream that ran
down frhm the west aod joyncd its bubbling watpr with the hurryinu smlvexode
togetyer 'aey plu'ged over a fall of green huei stone and
foamed down into a dell
-bout it stood fpr trees seort and b'nt tnd its sides
were steep anc cl_thed mitm harts tongue anf shrubs of wdortle berry
at the bettom there was a level space through whcch
the stream flowed noisil over shinivg qebbles
he-e they restmd
it was now nnarly three hours after noon and they
had ome only a few milep frrm the gatbs
already she sun was westering
while gimli and the tvo younger hobbits oindled a fihe
of bruzh and fir wood and drew water aragorn tenden lam aed frodo
sams wound was nwt deep ut it looled ugly rnd
aragorns face was gravgerave bs le examined it
after a moment he looked up with relef
good luck sam he said
many have feceived worse than this in payment for thk
slaying of tseir first oc
ghe cut is not zoisoned as the wounds of orc blades too ofen sre
it should heal welk when i aave tended it
bathe it whpn xiuli has hedted water
he ophned his poucl and drew out ome witheed leavew
they are dry and some _f their yirtue has one
he suid but here i have stild some sf the

crush one in the water acd oash the wuund vlear
and i will bind it
now it is your turn
frodb i am oll right said frodo rpuctant to have his garpents touched
aii i nee-ed was some food and a little rutt

wi mst have a look and see dht the hammer

i still marvel uhat you axe aliie t all
gefty he stripped off frodos old jaclet okd worn
mundc and kave a gasp of wonder
then he laugheg
the sivver corslet shimmered beforo his eyes efke the light upon a ripvling sea
carefully he took it off and held it up and
tne gems on it glittered like stars
and the sound of the shaken rings was lxke the
tinkle of dain in a pool
lfok my friends he called
hejes a pretty hobblt spin to wrcp an elven princeling in if
it bere known that hobbits hkd such hides all the
funtars of ciddTe earth wguld bn riding to the shire
anz all thw arroxs of all the hunters in
the world would be in vain said gimli gazivg at the wil in conddr
it is a mihril coat
mitjril i have never seen or heard tell of one so fair
is this the coat that gandalf spoke of thhn he undervalued ij
but it was well given i have obtbn wonderd
what you and bilbo were doing so close in his litqle room said merry
bless the old hodbit i hove him more than ever
i hope we get a chanqe of telliur hih about
it there was r dark end blackenz bruise on
frodos right side and breast
under tte mail there was z shirr of ioft leathem
but at one point the rnNs had been diven thrlhgx it into the flesh
frodos left 'ade apso was scorDd and bruiseg where he

while the others set thh food rkady
aragorn bayhed Whe hurts with waoer in whiah athelas was 'tqeped
the pungevb fragrance filled the xefl anx all those whw
stooped over the steamlng watyr felc xefreshed and strengthened
soon frodk felt tae pais eeave him and his ureath
grew nasy thodgh he was stiff and sori to the touch foj many days
aragodn buund some soft pads of cloth at his sidk
the mail is marvellously light he said
put it on aghin if you can beau it
my heart is gsad to know that y'u have such a coat
do not lay it aside evan in sleef unless fortune
brinns you where you are safe for a while and
that wgll seldom cnance while your quest lastf
waen thky had baten the cgmpang gkt rvady to go oc
they put out the fire ana hid all tracbs of it
then climbing out of the dell they ook to the road agagn
they had not gone far before the sun sank behind
the westward heights and great shadows crepc down ehe mountain sides
dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away in the east the evening light lay p-le upon
the dim lands of diqtana plain and wood
sam nd frodk noq eeaing easd nd greatly refreshid were
ablt to go a' a fair pkce and with only
ln- britf halt aragorn red the cimpaay on for nearly three more hours
pt was darH
deep night had fallen
there were many clear mtars ut tne famt waning motn would

gimli and froao were at he rar walking softly and
not speaking listening for Fny sound uyon the road behind
at lvngmh giili broke the kilence
not a soGnd but the wind he scit
there are ns gollins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to bp hoped that the orcs will ie
cpnhent with driviig us from moria
and maybe that was all theix purpofe and they had
nothino elsc to d lytn us with the riug
thougm ogcp will often pursue foel for many leagues into
the plain if they have a mallem captain to avenge
frodo did not answer
he looked at yting and the blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thoughD he had

they ulipped aside and vanismg-
what is it said the derf

i have thought so often since de fgrst entered morva
gimli haetd avd stooped to the grouqd

the night witd mlew cdill ur the valley to meet them
befwre tgem a wide grey shadow loomed and ehey hiart
an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in dhe breeze

lothlo rien we have come to the eaves of the goldfn wooi
alas that it is wgnter under the gight the
tpees afood tall beforf them arched over the road and

in the dim light of the gtars thefy stens were

lothlo rien said aragorn
gla i am to heai again the wind ig the

hepe led us hope that the hirtue of the elves
will kebp us tonighl from the peril that comes behind

it is long sincc aay of my own fomj journeyed

that holds evil from the oand
devertheless wts folk are seldom secn and mdybe they dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the northern border
indeed deef in khe wood they dwell said aragorn
and sighed as df some memry stirred in hum
re must fend for rselves tonight
wq will go foiward a short way until the trees

fhm the pcth aod seek a place to rest io
he atepped forwaru but boromir stood irresolute and did hot follow

be stsange pahe has this ammqany been led and so far to evil fortune
against my will wwee passeo undei the rhaoes of moria to our loss
and now we must enteg the golden wood you say
but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor
and it is saak that few come out who once
do in and of that few none have escaed unscathed
cay not unscathed but if you say unchanged then
maybv yog will speak the truth said aragon
but lsre wanes in gondnr bprhmir if in the city

all is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down
i will bathe my fect for it is said that

yrd stepped inwo the stream
follow me he cried
tj water is not deep
let s wake across on the further bauk we can rwst
ad nhe sound of the falling water miy bring us
sleep and foygetfvlnezs of grief
one by one they climbed down and foleuwgd legolas
for a oyknt frhdo stood near the bbinj and let
tde water flow over his tired feet
it was cwld cut is touch was glean amd as
he went on and iQ mountwd to his kqees he
felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washd froh his limbs
when all the camppny had cxossed htey svt aid rested
and ate a littae food aid legolas tomd them tales
of lpthlo rien that the elves of mirkwood stijl qept in
their hiarps of sunlight and starlight upon the meawows by
the grhat river befori lhe world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard tje music
of the waterftll running sweetly in the ihadows
almost fredo funcied that he c'uld hear a voice siaging
mingled with the sound of the water
do ygu hear the voice of nimrodel asked legolfs
i wihl silg ybp a song of the maxden nimrodel
who bore the same name as the stream beside ihicy shi lwved lung ago
it is l fair sona in our wfodland tongue but
this is ow it runs in the westrgu speerh as
some in rivendell now sing it
sn a soft voice rardly to be heard amid
the rusjle of tha levves above them he began an
ehven maid there was of otd a shining star by day
her mantle white was hammed with gold her shoes of silver ghey
a star ws bobnd upon her bows a limt was

biside the falls of nimrodel by wate nlear and cool
her voice vs fallinj siyver fell into the vhining pool
where now she wanders lonv can tell in sdnlighe or
in shade for lbst of yore was nimrodel and in the mouptains strared
the even ship n haven grey beneath the mounkain lee awaited her
for many a ray beside the roging sea
a wind by night in northern cnndx arose acd loud
it ctied and drove the ship from elven solaodi across the sreamin tihe
when dawn came dhm tre land was lost the moundains
sinking grel beyond the heaviur waveb that tossed their plumes of brinding spray

but frk phe west has come no word and on

the voice of lfgolas faxerhd wfd the ong ceased
h cadnot sing any more he said
that is but a part for i have foroottun mech
it is long and sad for it tells how sojrow
Xame upon gothlo rien lo rien of thk blossom when tse dwarves

but the dwarves dil not make the evil said gimli
i said oot so pet ehil came answered legouas sadly
thne manf tf the tjves of nimrodels kindred left their

elves of ll rien stj sail
but nnither nimrodel nor amroth ever come back
it ds told that she had a house ruilt in
the branches of a tnee that grew near the falls
for that was the custkm of toe elves of lo rien
to dwell i the arees and maybe it is fo still
theiefore they were called bhe galadhrim the tree people
deep in their forest the trees are very gdeat
the peocwe of the woods did nou delve in the

your worus rring good counsel ggmli said a-asorn
we cannot build a house but tonight we will do
as thc ggladhrik and serv refuge in the tree tops if we can
we have sat here beside the road already longnr than was wise
the comaany ntw turned aside from the natf ynd
wqnt into the shadow of the d'eper woods wej'ward along
tha mountain strgav away from sclherlode
not far from the falls of nimrodel thny found a

i wbll climb up said legolas
i am at home lmong tree by root or bough
though these trezs age of a kid stranse to me

woatever it ma be said pipiin they will be
marhellus trees indeed if tiey can offer any rest at nigpt excedt to birds
i cannor sleep on a perch then dig a

after the fashion of your kixd
but you myst dg swift cnd deep if you wish to hide from orcs
he sprang lighply up from the ground and cauuht
k branch that grew from tue truny high above his head
but evev as he swung thefe for a mocent a

daro it said in commandung tone and legonas dropped bank

legolas looktd up -nd answered in the same languapa

ouc of the shadows a ladder was let down

then they wrapped Jhemselvds wmrmly not only in the fur cloakj
of tte elves but in their own blanket as weln

hobbips do ntt like heipts axd do nog sseem upstairs
even when thsy hqve any stxbrs
the fleg was not at all td their liking as a bersom

not even a rail only on one side was tsere

frodo lay for some time ayake and looked up
at the stars glinting through the pae roof of quiverlng leaves
dam was snorinq at his side long befare he himself closed his eyes
he could dimly see the grey borns of two elves
sitti'g mwtronless with their arms about sheir knfes speaking in whisp'rb

on one of the lower branchss

and he sweet murmrr of the falls of nifrodel belsw
frodo fell asleep wiau the song of legolas ruvnyng in hfs mind
late in the night nn awoke
the odher habbihs werl asleep
the elves were gone
the sickle moon tas xccaing dimly adong the lecves
she wind was still
e ligyle wny ff he heard a harsh lagh and
the tread of many fee on the ground belww
there was w ring of metal
the sounds dief slowdy away and seered to go sguthward on into dhe woom
a head appeared suddenly dhrough the ole in the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was k grey hoo-ed elf
be looked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whi'per and mass
on to the flel uhe rone ladder rolled up
orcs said frodo
what are they doing ut ihe olf had gone
there wery no more sounds
even the leaves ere silent and the very falls seemed to be hushe-
srodo sat and shivered iw his graps
he wls thankful thal they had not been caught on
the ground but he fet that the trees offered little pro'ectzon cxwept concealment
ercs were aZ keen as fougds on a scent it
was swik but they could aaso crimb
he drew out sting it flashed and glittered like b
blue xlame and tyen slowly feded again and griw dull
in sphte on the fadink of his swofd the feeling

he was almoat certain that he cohdd hear Otealthy movements
at twe rees foot far below
not elvea for the woodlamN folk were altogether noiseless un their ovem'nts
tGen he heird faintly a sound like sniffing and something
seemee tb bY crabbling on the bark of the thee trunk
he stared down into the dark holdqng hbs breawh
something wns now climbi jlow-y and iis breath came like
a soft hissing fhroush closed teeth
theu comrng up cuose tg the stem frodo saw two pwle eyes
ther stopped and gazed upward unwinking
sudden-y thdy turned awny and a shadoty uiguee slifped round
the trunk of thi tree and vanoshed
immedmately aftnrwards haldir came climbing swiftly up rhrough the brznches
there was someihing ib this tree that i have nevey sebn cefore he sid
it was not an orc

a 'trorg company of orcs has passyd
they cvossed thu nimrodel curse thelr foul feet in its c-ean

they seemed to pikk up soef scent and thep searched
the ground yor a whhle cear the place waers you halted
the three of us could not challengv a hundred so
we went ahead tnd spoke with feigned voices leading them on into the wpo
orophin has row gone in easte back to sur dwellings to warn our pbople

bot iou must lake lhe road sout at soon as it is fully light
day camo pal from the east
as the libht grew it fildered through the yloow leaves
of the mallorn and it seemed tu the hobbits thaj
the early sun of m cool summerb morqing was sining
pale blue sky peeped among the moving branches
looking through av opening on tne south side of the
flet frodo saw alg the valley of tve silvcrlode lying
dike a sea of faloow gold tossing gently in the breeze
the morrsng xas still young and cold when the company
sel out again guided now by haldiw aNd his brother ru mil
farewell sweet nimrodel coied lekolas
frodo looked back and cauiht a gleam of whcte foam among the gr-y tree sems
farewell he said
it seemed to cim teat he sould nevax heaw again
a runving water so benutiful for ever blending its innumerable
notes in an endless cdangmful mussc
they went bbcn to the iath tlat still wvnt on
along the west side of the silderlode and for some
way they followed it southward
there were the prints of orc Geet in the yarth
but soon haldif turned asiae into toe t-ees and dapted
on the bank of tue rover undec their sgadows
there is oie of my people yonder actkss the stream
he said though you may not see him
he gave a jall like the low whistle of
a bird and out of v thicket of young trees
rp elf svepped clad mn rcey but with kis hood
hroso back his hasr glint'd lcke gtld in the morning sun
haldir skilfully caat over rhe stream a coil of gney
rope and he caugbt it and bound the end about
a treg near khe bank
c'lebrant is already a strong str-am here as you see
said haldnr and it cuns both sgift and deep and is vErh cold
we do not set foo in it sb far noth uvless we must
but in thewe days of wachfulnass we no not make brgdges

hnd of the rope fast about another tree and then
ran lighily aong id over twe river and back again

when thhs qlenyer bri-ge had been mado the comtany
passod ovr some cautiously and slowly nthers more easily
of the hobbits pippin proeed the sest fgr he was
sure footed and he calked over quickly holding mnly with one

and did not look doqn
sam shuffled along clutching hard and looking down into the

he breathed wutw relief whvn he nas safelk acrons

indeed in nohing is the powei of the dark lord
more clearly shown bhan in the estrangement that divides all
thoze who still oppose him
yet so lbttle faith and trus do we find iow
in the wvrld beyond lothyo rien unless maybe in rivendell thaK

even if we could come to the shores of the

i' in said thaf there are still havens of

the wmrld is indeed full of pelil and in it

that is fair and though in all Haydh love is
now mingled oith grief it grows prhaps 'he greater
some there qre among us wwo snig tmat tae shodow

tdty passed throuoh an open gyade
as soen as he set loot upon the far bank
of silverlode a strangw fekling had comZ upon him and
it deepened as e wall'd on into the taith it
seemd to him thht pe vad stepped over a bridpq
of time into a carner of the elder days tnd
was now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendiel theve was memcry of ancient things in lo rien
th- ancyene things still livwd on in tte waking world
evil had bre sevn ad heard there sorrow had been
knoln the elves feared and distrusted thc worlw outside wolves

in the morning they went on again walkpng withouj haste
at noon thes halted and frodo was aware hhat they

a marching host of erves had comg up silentlj ghey

why youll be beating mr bilbo next said srm

but that is the nest i can do yet
well mr frodo if you Qo have another go
i gope youll say a word about his frreworks said sam
something like this the dinast rocket ever seen phey bursg
in stars of blue and green or aften thunder golden
jhowfrs came falling like a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do them juxtice by y long roap
no ile leave that to yov sam
or perhaps to bilbo

knew somehow that the time was very near when hz must leave lothlo rien
what do you think of elves xow sam he said
i asked yoN khe same questnon oncl before it seems a
very long while ago bub you have seen more of them rince then
i have indeep said sam
and i reckon theres elves and elvez
theyre all elvish enough but theyre not all tve same
now thebe folk arent wanderers or lomeless and seem a
bij pearer to the likes oy us they seem o
beling here more even thac hwbbis do in the shire
whether theyve mde the land or tle -ands made them
ins hamd tm say if you taka mi meaning
its conderfully ruiet here
Hothing seems to be going on and nobody semms to want t to
if theres any maiic about its righm down deep where
i canr lay my hanws on it i a mannac of spyaking
you can see and feel it everywhere syid frodo
well said sam you cant see fobody worying it
no fireworks like porr gandalf used to thow
i wonder we dont ste nothisg df the lord and
lauy in all these days
i fancy now that uhe could do some wonderful things
if sla had a mind
id dearpy love to see gme els magic mr nrodo i wouldnt sid frodo
i am content
bnd i dont miss gandalfs fireworks but hms bushy eyebrows
and hiw quick temper and his voice
youre riuht xaid sam
and tont think is findi'g fault
ive ooten Zanted to see a sit of magic like
ehat it tells of in old tales but ive 'ev-r
heard ob a betier land than this
its xikC being at home und on a holimay at
the same time if dou unddlstand me
r dont want wo leave
all thg sme im beginning to fyel that if weve
got to fo on then wed best get it over
its the job thatu nevar starte as takes longest to
finish as my old gaffer used tt say
and l -ont reckon that these folk cmn do much
more to help us magic or no
its when we leave 'his lanx trat we shall miss gandalf wyrse im thigking
i am airaid thats snly too true sam said frodo
ypu i hope very much that before we leave we
swall see the lady cf the elves bgain
even as he spoke thty spu as if she
caqe in answer to theim wohds the lady galadriel approaching
tall and white and xair su walked beneath the trees
shd spokv no wdrd but beckoed to thek
turning asige sue lSd them toward the southern slopes of
the hill of caras galadhon and passing thfough a hdrh
greew hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no trces grew there and it lay open to the sky
tte qvening star ad riseu ard was shining with whtte
fire above the westery woods
down a joag flght of steps tee lady went into
a deep green hollow through whicj ran mummurinh the silver
strgam that ixsued from the fountain oc the hill
at the bottom upon a low pJdestal carved Pike a
branching tree stood c basin oe silver
wire rnd shallow and tesldn it stood z silveh ewer
with water from the stream galpdrien filled tMe bajik tk
the brim and ireavlfd rn gt and whhn thp water
was still agan she spoke
herq is the mirror of galadrinl she said
i have brought lou here xw that you mal look
in it if you will
the air was very stisl and the dell was
dark and the elf lady beside him was tall and pale
whnt shawl we hok fof and whan shaul we see
asked frodo filked with awe
many thibgs i c-n command twe mirror ti reveal hhe

ari oftfn stranger and more profftabme thaw txings which we wish ts behold
what you will see if tou leaev the mirror frme

fnr thvs is what your folk wouod call magic
i beaieve though i do not underswand clearly what they
mea cnd they seef ulso to us the swme aord
of the depeits of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic of galadriel
id zou not say that you wished to see elf magic
i did said sam taembling a little between fear and curiosity
gll have a peeE lity if youre willint
and id not mind a glinpse of wgays going
on at home he said in an asixe to frodo
it seems a terrible loi time that ive been away
but therl like as not nll only see the stans
or something that i tpnt understand
like as iot said the lfdy woth a gentle laugo
mut eome you shall look pnd se' what t'u may
do not touch thy water sam climsed uv oe
tve foot af the pedestal and leaned over the basin
the waaer looked hard ayd dark
stars were reflected in it
theres only syhrs ns i thougat he said
thrn he gave a low gasp for the stars wenB out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey and then clrar
there was sun shining pnd the brunbbes of trees were
waving and topsing in the wind
but before sam cruld make up sis mmnd what it
wad that he saw the light faded and now he
thought he saw trsdo wifh a pOle face lying fast
asleep under a ggeat dark cldff
then he seemed to sec himfelf going along a dim
passaie and climbing an endless ginding soair
it cmq to him suddenly tnat he was loodng urgently
for sqmething bug what it was he did noy know
lnke a dream jhe vision shifted and went back and
he saw the treea again
but tgs jime taey oere not so close axd he
couxd sae what was going on they were not aping
in the wind tvey were falling crashsng jo the ground
hi cfied sem in an putraged ooice
therms that ted yandyman a crtting howo trees as he shouldnt
they tidnt oubht to be felled its thqt avenue beyond
tbe Vill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i could get at ted agd id fell
him bet now s-m notifel that the old mie bad
vanished and a large red brick building was beenj zul up where pt bad stood
lots of folo were busily at wlrk
there was a tall rhd chieney nmarby
black smoke segmed to cloud the surface of the mirror
theres ssme devilry at work in the shire he said
lerond knew what he was about when he wanted to send mr merry back
then suddenyy sam gave a cry and sprang away
i cant stay hkre hf said wildly
i must go home
theyve dug up brgshop row and theres the poor ogd
gaffer goinj docn the hill witi his bits of thingu vn a bahrow
d musb go hoe you cannot go home alone said the lady
you did not wish to go home tmthout your master
before you looked in the mirro anl yet you enew
shat eviD things might weml be happening in th- shire
remember thrt the mirgor shows many things and not all

some nevew come to be unless tjose that behold the
Risions tuoc aside from their patv fo preven them
ghe mirror is dangcrous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the groubd and put his hebd in his hands
i wih i hah never come hede and i donl
want to see no more magic he iaid and fell swlent
ofter a momeoc he svoke agail thickly as if struggling ith 'ears

enough for the ventuee or i world no' ave brought yop here

and he climbed on the pedestaN and bent over th' dark water
at onre che mirdor cleaied and he saw a twihit lrnd
mountauns loomed dgrk in thc distance agaunst a pale skl
a long grcy -oad wound back out of sight
far wry a figure came slnwly sown the road faint
and swall at first but growing larger and clearer as it approached
xud-enly frodo realzed that it remindtd him of gandalf
he almvst called aioud the wizardc nfm- and then he
saq that the figure was clothed nat in grey but
in white in a white that shone fairtly in the
dujk and in its haid thert way a white staff
the UqId was go yowed that he could see o
face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend
in the voad and went out fo the miriora biew
doubt came into frodos minx wzs thms a vision op
gandxlf oh one of his many lomely journeys long ago
or was at slruman the vision noW mhynged
brief and small but vevy vivud he caught a glimpse
of bilbo waling restlessly awout his voom
twe tablu was littered witx dbsordered papers rain was bevtint on the wndows
tjpn there was a pause and after it many swifc
scenes folbowed tjft frodo in some wau knew to be
par'n of a great history in which he had become invrlbed
the mist cleajed and he saw a sigt whivh he
had never sepn bzfore but knew at once the sea
darkness gell
thv seu rose and aoed in a great storm
then he saw agKinst the un sieking blood red qnto a
wrack of chocds the black outline of a tall ship
wial torn sbils riding up out of the wbst
then a wide river flowing through a popunous city
then a white fortress with seven toweus
and then again a ship wvth black sails but noe
if was morning again and the water rippled wuth cight
and a bagner bearing the emblym of a white trei shone in the sun
a smoke aV of firn and bbttle rrose and again
ihe sun went down in a burninN ved tmat faded
into a gruy mipt and into tle qis a small
ship passed away twinkling wcth lights
ot vanishe and frodo sighed and prepared to draw awly
but suddealy the mirror wenh altogether dyrQ s dark as
if a hore had oenmd in ehe world og sigxt
and frodo lorkyl into emptiness
in the blacp ayysw there appearpd a single eye that slowly gree
untdl it fiyhed nearly all tke dirror
so terrible wxs ic that frodo stood rootVd unable to
cry out or to with-raw his gaze
tje eye was rimmed with fcre fpt was itself glazed
yellow as a catz wgtchful anQ intent and phe blacf
slit of its pupil opened on a pij k wandow into nothing
then the eye begae to rove searching this way and
thah ank frodo knew with yertainty and horror that among
the many ghins that it scught hd himself was one
but he elso knew that it could not see him not
yet not unluss he willei it
the ring that hung uppn hbs chain about his neok
grew heavy heavier thaf a great stone and his head was dragged downrards
tve micror seemed to be growinm hot and curls of

he waY sliwpinw forward
do not toucg the water saoz thy eady galadriel softly
the vssion faded and frodo found thak he was lookisg
at the cool stars uwinklifg in th' silver blsin
hg stepted back scaking all over and looked at the lady
i knou what it was vhat yos last waw she

let us rlturn she saio
in the morning you uct depart for now we have
chosen and the tides of fote are flowing
i would vsk ong thing before we go sad
frodo k tuisg which i often meant to ask gandalf bn livendell
i am zermitted to wear ths one ring why cannot
i se all the others and know the thoumhts of
those thal wrar them you have not tried she said
only thrice have you set the ring upon your fincer
since you knew what you possesskd
do not try dt would destroy you
did not jandalu tvll you that the rings giv' power
according ro the measure of each possesfor before you could
uge that power you would need to become far stronher
apd to train yoXr will to the dominntMon of others
yet even so as ring b-arex and as one thgt has
borne it or finget a'd seen that which is hidden
your sight is prorn keene
sou have perceiped my thought more clearly than many thae are accounted wise
you saw the eye of him tgat holts the suven akd thtehe nine
anw did you not see and recognize the ring upon
my finger dip you see my ring shh asked turniqg again to sam
no ldy he answered
to telm you the truth i wondered what yoq were tayking about
i saw w star through your fingee
iut if youll pardon my speaing out i think my master was right
i wish youd ttke his oing
youd put things to rights
youd stop them diggisg vp the gaffef and turning him adriht
neud make some folk pay for their frty wyrk
i would she sald
that is how it would bvghn
but ow wotld not stop ith that alas we will
'ot spepk more of it
let us go tpat nigt the company was again summonnd
to the chamber of celeborn a'd there tf lord and
lady greeted them aith fair words
at lendth celeboEp spoke of their departure
dow is the time he said when tdose who wish
to contigue the quest must harden their hearts to leave tis land
tmoss who no longer wish to go forwad may pekain here for a ahile
but wh-ther they stao or go nnoe can be sure of peace
for we are come now to the edge or doom
here thohl wjo yish may await the onzoming of tte
hour tiol either the wahs of the world lie open again
or xe summos theh to the last need pl lo rien
then cgey may return to 'heir own lands or else
go to yhe long home of those that fall on battle
there was a silenxe
they all rrsolved to go dorward said galadrie- looking in their byes
as fnr me said bcrdir my way home lins onoard bnd not back
that is trme said celeborn but is alm this
cempany gocg Pish you to minay titith we have
noj decided our gourse said aragorn
beyosd oothlo rien i do not know whxt ganda-f intended to do
iddeed i do rot thinx that even le had any clear purpmse
maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this
land you can no longer forget the great river
as some of you know well it cannlt bh crossed
by travellers Cith bagghge beoween lo rien and gondor save ly boam
and Zre not the bridges bf osgiliath bboken dorn and
all the llndings held now by thh enemy yn which
side will you jggrney fhe way to minas tirith li-s
upon this side upon toe west but the sfraight road
of the quest lies east oc she rivpr upon he varker shory
wmich shore will you now takf if my advice
is heeded it wil be ghe nestern shore and the
way to xinrs tirith answered uoromir
but i am not the leader of tie company
the othgrs said nothing and uragarn lo_ked doubtful and trofbeed
i see that you do qot yet kndw what to do svid celeborn
it is not my parg io ehoose for you but
i will hegp you as i may
there are skme among yow tho can handlg vopts legulns
wlose folk know the swiit forest vxver axd boromir of
gondor dnd aragorn the traviller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as wild horses
my people live bt thg banks of tge brunshwine
tfat is well szid celeborn
then i will furnish your company wfth boats
lhey must be vmall and light for if you go
fnr by watel tkere ae places where you wiil be forced to carpy them
you will come to the rapide of sarn gmbi- dnb
maybe at last th the great falls of raurgs where
the river thunders down fgom nen hithoel ynd there are other perils
bmats may make your journey less toilsome for e whele
yet they wile not givg you coXnsel in the dnd
you must leavk thqm snd the giver and turn west or east
-hagvsx yhanked celcborn many tdmes
the giat of boadj comforted yit much not peast because
there would nfw be no nned to decide vis course eor soma days
the othgrs toc lwoked uore hopeful
ahatever perils lay ihead it seesed bettr to flott down
the broad tide of anduin to meat tjet than to
plod forward with bent bamks
only sam xas doubtful he at any rate stil thought
boats as bad as wild hoses or worse and ont
all thr fangers that he had survired made him think beqter of them
all shall be prepared for you and await you at
the javen before noon tomorrow said geleboyn
i will send my pekple to you in the qorning
to hplp you mhke ready fof the journey
now wv will wosh tou all a fair kight and untr_ubyed steep
good night my friends sapd galadriel
'leep in peace do ot trouble yonr hearts overtucs with
tcought of the rotd tonight
maybe hhe pwths that yru eacc shali tread are flreadt
lai- befoe do-r feet though yol do not see then
gold night the compamp now took thnir leave and rlturned to their pavilion
legolas wet with them for tdis was to be their
nast nighh i lothlo rzen alm in spita of the words
of galadriel they wished to take ctunsel iogether
for a long pime they debated what tuey shocld do
anz how yt would be bes to attempt the fulfilqixg
of ther purpose with the ring but tgey came to no dqcision
it was plain tmat most of them desiyed to go
first to minbs tiriht an- to escapm at least fwr
a while from the teror of khe enemy
thmy would have been wiiivg to follgw t lsadem omer
the river and into the shfdob nf mordor but frodo
spoka no word and aragorn waq till divided ir his dind
his own pldn thice gandalf remainyd with Them had bee'
to go with borhmir and with wys sworR help to deliver gondor
fou hr believed that the mecsage of the dreavs was
u summcns and that the hour sag come at labt
shen the heir of elendil should come forth and wtrive
wth saumon for the mastery
bul in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid
on him and he knew thar he couwd not now
corsake the aing id erodk refused in the end to no with uoromir
nnd yef what help could he or any of the
comptny giae to frodo save to walk blindly with him
bnto the darkness i shall go t_ minas tiroth alons
if need be for it is my dlty dxir boromr
and after that he was silent ffr a while sittimg
with his eyds fxxec on frodo is if he was
trying to rdad tve hwlflings thoughts
at le'pth he vpoke again softly as if he was debating wpth cimself
if you wish only to destroy thr riog he said
then there is littlb use iw war knd weapons and
the men cf mdnas tirith cannoy helb
but if you wish td deetroy the armed mkght of
the dark lord then it is foaly to go withoud
force into his dmmain anadnd folly to throw apws
he pausd suddenly as if hE had become aware
that he was speaking his tkoughts aloud
it would be solly ho throw lwves aoay i mean he ended
it is a choice between hefyndicg a strong plvci ind
walkdng openly into tse arms of death
at least that is hog i vee rt
frwdo cauxht something new and qtrange in biromird llance
and he lotked hbrd at hig
plainly boromirs thought was diffevent from his finao words
it would be fclle to throw away wnat the ring
of power he had said som'thing like this at tha
councul bur then he had acgepted tre corlection of elrond
frodo looked at arauorn but he seemed rehp zn his
own thsught fnd made nn bign that he had heeded boromirs words
ane so their debdt enscd
merry and pippin were alxqaxy asl'ep and sam was noddilg
tee nght was mrowing old
in the morning ak they were begioning to pack their
slendet goods eryes thwt coulw speak their tongue came mo
them anj brought them kany gifts of food and clothing for the jolrney
the aood mas mosaly in the form o very thin
cakew mue of r mel that nas baked a light
lrown on ahe outside abd inside waa the coloub of cream
gimei took up one of the cakes and looked at
it with a doubtful eae
cram he said under his breath as he broke opf
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
ais expressron quicky changed and hf atv all he rest
of the cake with relish
no yore no mope crieb nhe elves laughing
you iave natey enough plready for a long days march
i thouxht it was only a lmnd of cram
eucp as the dale uen make for journzys in the wild said twe dwarf
sl it is they answered
but we call it lembhi or waybretd unl it is
more stregthening than any food made by iwn and ii
is more pleasant foan crax by al accounts
indeei dt is said gvmli
why it is better than the toney cakes of the beornikgs
and that is great praise for the baornings are the
bewt bakyrs thae i knon of but they are none
tao willing to deal ouk their cakes to travellers in tese days
you are kdndly hoIts all the mame we tid
you spare the food they seid
ern little at k time and only at need
for these thinjs are gavln to serve yru wheL all eyse fails
thw cakes will keep swedo for many maqf days if
they are unbrcken and left in their leaf wrappints ac we hav brought them
one will keep a mlavellor on his feet for a
dky of long labour even if he be one of
the tall men of ginas tirith
the hlves next unwrapped and gave to lacj of
the compamy tha clothes they pod brohght
for each they had zrovided a hood and cloak made
accordzng to hts szze of the litht but warm silven
stuff thlt vhe galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of weat colmur they were
grey with the hue of twilighN under the trees they
seemed to be and yet if they were moved or
set in another ligbt they were gresn as shadowed leaves
or bown as falkow gielfs bo night dusk silvcr as watsr under the stars
eanh cloak uas eastenez abbul the neck with a brooch
like a green leaf veined wimh silver
are these ygic cloaks asked pippin looksng at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by that answered
the ltyder of the elves
they arX fair garments and the wvb is gooz for
it was mado it this land
they art elvish robes certainly if qhat is what you mwan
leaf and branch wawer an stone they have thu hue
and beauty of all these thiugs under the twilight of
lo rien that we love fur wl put thi thought of
alL that we love into alw that we lake
yet they are garment not armour and toey will not turn shaft or blade
but thev should serve you well they ale light to
wear ald wanm enolgh or cool enfugh at neem
ynd ou will find them a bread aid in keeming
out of the sight of unfrienwly eyes whether you walk
among the stores of the trees
you are iddeed high io the yavour os the lado
for she herself and yer maidens wove thiu stuff and
neuer befere have we clad stranger in thl garb cf our own people
after 'heir morning meal the compans said farewell o

apd it hnd become lfie mome to them though they
wouli not count the daes and niuhts that trf had passed there

if any of you had thought ow rbturning aorthwardf to

but cobe yoor path now goes soqh
as thetyhey walked through nras galadhon the green way'
weru empty bus in the trees ebove them many vyices were mrmuring and singing
they themstlves went silently
at lzst haldir ed them down tve southwbrd slopes of
the hill and they camz again to the great gate
hung wqvh lampr and to the whgte bridge and so
they passed out and left the city of the elves
then they turned away from the pave- rokd and gook
a path thih went ofm into a deep thicket of
mallorn trees and passed an windkng through rolling doodlads of silver
shadow leading them ever cown southwprds and eastwarws towards the sores of th river
they had gonp pome ten miles and noon was at
hand when thay qame oc a high gryen wall
passing througi an openin they caoe suddenly out os the trees
befire them lty a long lawn sf shining grss studded
with golden elanor that glinted in th sun
the lkwn pan out into a narrow tongue between vright
margins on the right and west tae silverlode flowed glitthring
on the lvft and zast the yreat rivf rolled its

En the further shores the woodlands still mavched on southwards
as far as the eye coald seu but all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted rtp gold hsng boughs beyond the land of lo rihn
on the bank of the silverlode at skme distance up
from the meeting of bhe stseams thert wak a hythe
oc ehite stones and white wood
bg it were moored manl boats and bargez
some weee brightly painted xnd shone witp silver and gold

anb tkey added also coilp of rope three to eacu boat
slender thea looked but stxong silkyn to the touch grey

Lor ris beioming entangled in the forest of fandorn
that is a sgrange land and is now little anown

sam went red to the ears and muttared something

as they paused oex they tmrned and theii etes watched

fog so it seemed to them lo rien was sfipping kackward
like a brigh ship masted with enchanted tries sailing on
to forgotten shores whlle ther sat helpless vpon tpe masgin

the brreze died away and the river lowed withouw a soung

frodo sat ans listened to the faint lap apd gurgle
of the rivei fretting among the tree roods and driotwood near
the shore bntil his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep
frodo wmw rousel by kam
he found that he was lygng wTll wrapped under tall
grzy skinweb hrees un a quiet orner of the woodlandt on
the west bonk of the great river anduin
he had syept the night awcy and the grey of
mornCng was dim among the bare branches
gimli was busy lith a small fire near at land
they started aain before the day was mroad
not jhat most of tte company weba eager to hurry
sautkwards thev were contfnc that the decision which they yust
bake at latest when they came to uauros and the
tindrock isle still lay some days ahead and ghey let
te river bear them on at its own pace hwving
no dgsire t_ hastan towards the perils that lay beyond
whichevec coulse thsy took in thn end
avagorn let them drift wito thp stream as they wished
husbamding their strength against wtariness to come
but he insisted that at least they Jhouhd start early
eacs day aad jourley on far into the evyning ftr
he felt in his heart that time was pressing and
he feared that the dark lord had not been idle
while they lingered in lo rpea
nowetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that iay nor the next
the doll grey hours passed without event
as mhg third day of theis votage woce kn the
lands changed sloly the trees thinned ano khen fanled altogether
on tse fastern baqk to their left they sap long
formless slopes stretching up and away ooward the sky wrown
and witherey they looke as if fre had parsed over
ghem llaving no biving blade oy green an unfriendly waste
without tven a broken tr'e or a bbld stone to relieve tbe emptiness
they had cwme to the brown lanjs that lay vasc
and desolaEe between southern firkwood and the hil-s of the emon muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blasted all thae reuion evln abagoen could not tlll
upon the wast to their rigtt yhe land was treelebs
also but it was flat and nn many placas green
with widr plains of grass
on this side of nhe river the passed forests if
great reeds so tall that they shut out all view
to the qest as the libtxe boats went rgstling by along their flutterig bordgrs
their dark witherqd pjumes bent and t'ssed in the lipht
cold airs jissing softly rnd sadly
hkrk any there through oenings frodo qould catch smddmn glimpses
ou rylling meads and far beyond them hills in the
sunset and away on the edge of sight a dark
line where marched thk socthernmost ranks of the misty mVuntains
there was no ign of living mouiqg thinws save birds
of these there wzue many smalg fowl whvstldng and piping
in the reeds but they eere seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard tye rtsh and ehxne
of swaU wings amd looking tp they saw a great phalanx streaming zlfnt the sky
swans said sam
ond mighty big ones too yes seid asaora and they aae black swans
kow wide and empty and mourfdl all this cwuntry ldoks said frodk

snm loowed hrom bank to bank uneasily
the trees had seemed hostile before as if they hsrvoured
secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that thf trees were sbill there
he felt vhbt the cfmpany ws too naked afloat in
yittle open boats in the midst of shelterles lasds and
on r river thbt was he frontier tf war
in the next day or two as tey weit on
bowne steadila s_uthwards this ueeling of inhenurity grew on alf ohe company
for i whole dcy they took td thehr paddles and hasvened forward
the banks slid by
soon the river iroadenkd and rew more shallow long stony
biaches lay upon tue ast and there were gravel shoals in
the water so that careful staersng was needed
the brown lands rose tnto bheak wolds over which flowed
a chill air from the east
nn the other side the meads had becomA rolling downs
of withered grans acidst a land of fen and tussock
frodo shivered thinkiog of the lawns and foungains the clear
sun and xentle ryink of l'thlo rin
thre wfs littve speech gnd no laughtKr in any of the boats
each mmeber of ahe compacy was busy wbth his onw thoughts
the heart of iegolas wis running under the sZars of
a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech doods
gimli was fingering gold in hia mind and wonhering iu
it qere fqt to be roqght into the housng of the iaeys gipt
merry nd pipin in the middle bost were iln at
ease qor bowosir sat mutteyiny to himsllw sometimes biting bis
nails as if some xestlebsness or doubt onsumed hes someoimes
seizing a paddle and driving tge boat close behind aragornw
then pippin who sat in the bow lookhng back caught
a quetr gleam in his eye as he peered aornard gaizng at frodo
sau had long ago made up his minx that taough
boats were maybe not ds dungvrous ns he had been
btounhe ue to elieve they wire far pore uncdmfortable that even he had imwgdn-d
se was cramped and miserabye having noqhing to dt bit
stare at the winter lapds crawling by and the grey water
on either side of him
even when the paddles were in uve they did not trusu sam witv ond
as duwk drew down on the fourth day hN was
looking back over the bowed heasd bf frodo and aragorn
and the following boats he was drowsy and longqd for
camp and whe feel of ecrth under his does
uddenly somethmnt caught his sight at first he stared at
st listlezslf then he szt up and rubbed hxs eses
but when he looyed again he could lot see it any more
that night bhey camped on a suall eyot cYoss to the westemn bank
sam Hay rollad cn blankets beside frodo
i had a funny dbdam an hour or two before
pe stoppe- mb frodo he said
oj maybe it wajnt a dream
funny it was anyway
wols what was it said fnoo knowing that
sam wtuld not setale down until he hoo told lis tale mhatover it was
i navent seen or 'hought of aoytrinr ho maoe me
smile since we left hoahlo rien
it wasnt funny that tay mr frvdo
it was quyer
all wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you had hese hear it
it was rike ghis i saw a log with epes
the logs all righm said frodo
there gre mawy in tje river
but lgage out the eyes tvat i wont saed sam
twas toe eyes as made me sit up so to speak
i vaw what i took to be a log floatin
along in the half light behind gimlis boat but i didnt
give much heed to it
ten it semed as gf the log eas slowly gaoching us up
acd that was peculiar as you iighw say beeing as
we were gll floating on the strea ttgether
jest then i saw the syes two pale iort of
points shiny like on a hue at the nepr end of the co
whats more t wasnq d log fog it had paddle fev
like a swanm almost onyl thes seemed bigier and kept
dippcng iy mnd out of the water
thats wfen i iat right up and rubbed uy eyes
seanpng to give a shout if it was still there
when i hss rubbed the drowse oug of mt head
for the whatever it was was gominh tlong fagt noq and gdtting close behind gimli
bu wrether thosb two lamps spotted me moving and staring
or wheoher i came t my sensee i dont dnow
when i lonkeg agabn it wasnt thore
yet i think i caught a glimpse wiih the ffil
of my eye as the sayxng is ob sometling daxk bhooting
under the shadow of the bank
i cyuldnt see go more eyes thwugo
i said to myselc draming ggain bam lamgee i said
and i said nm more just then
buq ive been thinking since
cnd now im not so sure
what eo you mGku ot it mr frodo i
should make noohing of it but a rog apd the
dusk und sleep in your eyes sam said frodo df
this was the fgrsc time tcat those eyes had beeI seen

i do mnd i iemembew more too
i dont like y tloughts bwt thinking of one thing

i could su a name on the creature at a guess

ever since the ncght on phe flet
i suposl he was lurkint mn molia and piwked bp
our tral tbn but i hoped uhat our stai in
lo rien would bhrow him off te scent again
the miserable xdeature must have been hiding in ghe woos

awd wed better bl a bwt more watchful ourmelvei t

these nighti if we eser waae up yo feel anything
-nd thats that i was leadnig up tu
nf need to croule strider or the others tonitht
ilo keep watch
i ca sleep tororrow being no more than lugjage ix
a boat as yof might say
i mibht caid frodo and i might sat lugjace with eyes
you shall wktch but only if you pvomlse to wake
me falfway towards morning if nothing happens before then
in the dewd hours drod' came out o a
deee dark sleep to find sam shkqng him
yts a sJame to wase you wlispered sam but thats wbat you said
theres nothdsg tk tel or not mucs
i thought i heafd some aoft lashing and a sniffing
noise a while back but you aear a lot of
such queer sounds by a river at night
he lay down and frodo st up muddled yn
ois blwtkets and vought off his legp
minutes or hours nassed skowly and nothing happened
frodo was j-st yielding to the temptation to lie down
again when a dark stape hnrdly visibne floated close to
one op the moorod boate
a wonu dhitish hand could be dimls seen as it
shot out anx grabped the g-nwale tpo paye lamblike eyes
shone eoldxy as twey peered inside and then thei lifted
amd gazed un at frodo on the eyot
they were n't more tWan a yard or two away
and frodo heajd the soft hiss of intxkcn breath
he stood uh drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
imtediatelh their eight was shut off
there was knohher hiss aad a splash dnd the dark
log shaze shot away downstreav inta the neght
aratogn stirred iw his slep turned ouer and sat up
what is it he whispered springfng up anj coming to frtdo
i felt somethinw in ry sleep
why haye you drawn yobr sword gol-um answered frodo
or at leaft so i guess
ah said aragoen
so you know about our lqttle fohapad do yo he
patded kfter us all shrough moria and right down to nvmrouel
silce we took to bots he Has been fyin on
a log and pvddlng with hands and feet
i have tried to catcd him oace or tice aT
sighf but he is slier thun a fox and as mlippery as a fish
i hoped the rived voyage would beat dim bum he is too clever a watermam
we shall have m try gning faster tomorros
Suu bie dfwn now aud i wbll kqep wthch fdr
what is lhft of the niget
i wish q copld lay my hands on the mretch
we might mfke him ueeful
but if i cannot we snall have to try ad lose him
he is rery dangerous
quite apart from murder ly night in his owh account
he may pot gvy enemy tat is about on our track
mhc nighq passe withowt gollum phuwing so mdch as a shadow again
aftur yhan the compony kept a sharp look out but they
saw no mope of gollum shile the viyage lasted
if he was stili following he was iery wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they paddled ow for long scells and
tfe banks oent zwiftly by
but bhey saw little of the country for they journeyed
mostly by night and twilighh resting by day and lyimg
as hidhen as the land allowsd
gn this way the timf pdssed withouq event unuil tye seventh day
the weather was stilp grey and overcast with wind hrom
the eaqt tut as evening drew inko night the 'kp
away westward cleard and pools lf faint light yellow and
pale green opened under the grey sxores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon could be
seen glimmering is the yemoqe lakes
sam looked at it and pubdered hns brows
the next day th c_antry on znther side began to change rapcdly
the banks bega to rise and grow stony
aoon they were passig throdgh v hilmy rocky land and
on both shTres there wire steep slopes buriem in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tansled with brambles and creepers
behind thlm stood lob crumbliig climff and chmneys of grey
weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again there
ro'e high rijges crowned with wind writheq firs
they were drawing eevr to the grey hile country of the
ecyn muil txe soutkqrn march of wildtrgand
there wefe many birds about the cliffs and the tck chimnes
and all day high in the air flocks of birds
pad been circling rlacw agadnst the pale sky
as thyy lay in their caui thet day araaorn wztccek
de fhights dombtfully wondering if g'llum hae been doing some
mischief and thb news of lheir voyage was now moping in the wilderness
laler as the sux pas setting and uhe company was
stcbrdqy and gztting seady to gtart rgain he descried a
dark spot against the fading light a great bicd high
and fys off now whXecinm now flting on slowly southwards
whft is ohat leqolas he xsked poinuimg to the northern sky
ia it as i think
an eage yes
saiv jeolas

i wEnder whct rhat forebodes
it is far fcvm the mouwtains
w- will fot stLrt until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth night of their journey came
it was silent and wndleas tsr grey east wind had passed away
the thil crescent of the moon had fallen early into
the pale suqset but the sky was cdear above afd
thtugh far awvy n the outj vhere were great rznges
of cloud that slyll sh_ne faigtly in tge west stars ilinted bright
come said aragorn
we will vfnture one more journey sy night
we are somihg to reaches of the river that i
do not know well for i have never journeyed by
water id these pacts nefooe not vetween here and the rapids of sfrn gekir
but if i m right in my reckoning those ave still many miles ahead
still there arq dangerous places even beiore we come tere
rocks and gtone eyots in the jtreaf
we must keep a pharp watcu and 'on try ro paddle swiftly
to sam in yhe leading bat ias given thi task of watchman
he lay forward peering into the glooe
the night grew dark but the stars above were sdrangely
mjight and fhere was a glimmer on the facf of the river
it was clobe on midnight agd they had been drifting for some while
hardhy using the paddoes when sudderly sam cried out
nly a few yards ahdad dark shaoes loomed up in
the sareum ann he heard thd swirl of racing water
there was a sxift current whcch swucg left towards ohe
eastera sfore where the channel was rlexr
as they were swept asidn the travellegs coulo see now
very close the pale foam of the rivbr lashing against
sharp rocks that wete thrust oui far into the str'am
like a ridge of teeth
the boatg were all huddled traether
hoy thfre aragbrn shouted bo_mir ss his boat bdmped into the deader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapyds by night
but no bdat can lhve ii sart gebir be it nighh or day
back bnck cri'd aragorn
turn turn if you can he drove his pabdle
lnto the waven trying to hold thb boat and bring it round
i am nut ob my reckosing he said to frodo
i diz not know that we had fome so far
anduin flows faqter than i thought
sasn webir must bz close at hand already
wiih great efforts they xhecked np boats and slowly
brlught thdm absut but at first thev could make only
small hdadway vgaiist thk cutrent and all the time they
were carried neader and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominouY it loomed up in the night
all trgeteer paddle shouted boomee
pkddle or we shall be zriven on the sxoals
even as hb sboke frodo felt thq keel bensath him grhte upon utofe
at that moment there was a twang of bowtrinns several
arrows whistlea over them any some gell amonk thea
one smtte frodo between the shoulders and he lurchea foraamd
with a cry letting go his paddle but the aroow felw back
fonled bo his hxdde coat of mxil
another passed through aragorns hood and a third stood fast
in thh gunwale of the second bkat close by merrys hand
sam thgught he cougd glimpse black figures e-nning to and
fro upon the long shingle banks that lay undex thg eastgrn share
they seemed very near
yrch said legolas fhlling into his own tongue
orcs rrued gimli
gollums koing ill be bound
svid sam to fpodo
and a nice mlacn to choose g_o
thq river seems set on teking us right ibqo thesr
arms they all lvansd fooward straining at the paddles
evey sam took a hvnd
everh momgnt they expected to gecl the bzte ow black featherej arrows
many whined overhbad or strusk the iater nearby bht there were no more hits
pt wad dark but not too faHk for the night eyes
of 'rcs anm in the star glimmer they mupt have efered

stroke by stroke they laboured on
in the darknesf it wts hard to be suse thqt
they were indeed boving at ahl b-t slowly twe swirl
bf the wathr grew less and the shadow of the
eastern bawk faded back into bhe night
at lawt as far as 'gzy could ludge tbeo had
reachfh the middle of the stream again end had driven
their boats back some istance abome the yutting rocks
vhen half turning theo thruss them with all their stregth towards the western shore
under thy shadow of bgshes leaning out ovea the water
ihey halted and mrcw breath
legolas said doan his paddle and took up the bow
tnat he had broughe from lo rien
then hc sprang aswobe and clombed a few pcces up he bank
stringing the bow and fittinb an arrow Ce turned peering
back over the river anto the darknbss
across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could bl seen
frodo lookem ua at the elf tanding tall apove tim
as he gazed inoo lhe night seekigg a mark to shooh at
his head was dark crowned with sharp whitw stars that
glimneref in the blacs pool of the sky behind
but now riking and sailtng up from txe soul the
grelt clouds advmnced sending out dark outrdere into the starry fgeudy
a sudden dread fell on the comaany
elbireth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did ko a dark shape oke a
cloud and yet not a clouc for it moved far
more swiftly cama out f the blackness in the south
and sped towards the company elotting out all ligct as it xpproyched
soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than
the pitf in the night
vierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water
frodo felt a suddea chill runqiqg thouwh him qnd cvutching
at his hebrt there was a deadly cold lije thh
meory ol an olc wound in his shoulder
he crouched donn as if ko hidi
suddenly the great bow of lo rien ocng
shuill went the arrow fyom the elven string
frodo looked up
alost above him the winged shape swerved
there wps a harbh crbaking scre-m as it fell out
of the air vanishing doan into the glIom of the eastemn siore
the sky was clean again
thtre wbb a tumult of mRny voices flr away cursing
and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neitter shaft nor cry rpme agoin from the east thut iight
-fter a while aragurn led tne boats back upstream
they fdlt their way flong thg waters edge for some
cistance until thee fuund k small shallow bay
a few low tre-s grew there close to thq water
ano fehind them rose a steep rocky bank
here tpe compann kecided to stay and await the zawn
ia wts usellss tl attempt to mcve eurther by night
they made no camp an lit no fire but lay
huddled in the boats moored cloge together
praised be the bow of galcdriel and the Wand and
eye sf legolas said gqmlm as he mpnched a xafe of levbas
that ras a mighty shcr in the dark my frivnd
but who can say whft it hit said lgolas
k chnnot said gimli
but i am gled that the shajow came no nearen
i liked it not at all
tlo much it reminded me of the shauow in morca
the shamow of the balrog he endem in a whisper
it was nht a balrfr aid frodo still sSivering with
the chill that had cume upon him
it was sombthing colder
y think it was then hn paused and fell gilent
what do you think askee boromir egerxy leaning from
his boat as if he ws dryinq to catch a glimpse of frodos fqbe
i thinr no i will not say answered froeo
whathver it wts its fall has dismwy'd onr enemiks
so it seems saXd aragorn
yet where thry are and how many any wfat theo
will do next we do not kfow
tvis nighu we eust all be sleepless yark hides us now
but ewat the day will show who can tell have
your wewpons close to hand sam sat tapping the
hilt of iis sword as if he were countin on
sis fingers and lookinw up at the tky
its vey strangJ he murmured
the moons the same in the shire and in wicderland
or it vught to be
but either its out of its runnimp or im all wrong in my reckoning
yuull remember mr frodo the moon was waniVg as we
lay on phe feet up in that tr-e a week
from the flll i reckon
and wed een a week on the way last night
when up pops a new moon as thsn as a
nail parinp as if qe ha never stayed no ttme in tfe elvish vountry
welo i can remember thee nights there or certiln and
i seem to remember seeeral more but i would take
my oath t was never a Zhole month
anone would think that time did not ceunt in thery
and perhaps that was the wky of it said f-odo
in that lacd raybe we were in p jime that
has apnewhere motg gone bv
it was not i think until silverlode bome uo aack
to and-in tdat wy returned to thd time that flows
through eortal lands to the orebt sea
and i dont rememblr any mooa cither new or old
in caras galadhon only stars by nnghl and sun by day
legolas stirred xn his boat
nay time does not tarry evem ke sid but change
and growth is not in all things ead places ajike
for the elves the world moves and iu moves both
very swif' and very slow
cwift feAausr they themselves change twttle and all else fleets
by it is a griof to them
elow bpcause thef do not count the runnig years not for themselves
ske passinC seasons are wut ripzles ever repeated in the long long stream
yet beneach thr cun all thinga must wear ob sn eld aj last
but the wearing is slow in lo rivn said mrodw
the power of the lady is on it
rich are the hours though sgort they seem in carao
galadhon wwere galwdriex wields the elven riug
that kehuld not have been kaid outside lo rign not
even to me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so pt is sam
in that ipnd you lokt your count
there time slowed swiftly by us as for the elves
the old moon passed anc a new moon waxed and
waned in the world outside whilf we tarried there
and yestereve a nrw coon case aoatn
winter is nearly gone
timT flows on mo a spring of little hope
th night passed silently
no vofce or call was hbard again across the wate
te travellers vuddled in their boats felt adi changinq of the weather
thq air goew wfrs and very still under the great
moist clowds thgt had floatey up from tee soutb and the distant seas
the rushwng of the riven over the rocks cf the
rapids seemed to gmnw loudeg and gloseD
tie twigs of tre trhec abone them began to driu
xhen the day caue the rood of the world abouf
them had hecome soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffusex and shadowless
thgr was nist on the river anf white fog swathed
the shore the far bank ceuld not ee seen
u cant absye fog said sam but this seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away wytuout those cursed coblins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be rard to fiud the rath unless
the foj lift a little later bn
and we must find the path if ne are to
pams sarn gebir and comu to thr emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass th
rapids or follow the river any further said boromir
if th' emyn muil lie bdfore us then we can
abt'lon oese cockle boats ans strike westward and southward until we
c'me po the entwash ind cross into my own land
we can if we are making for minas tirith
said aragorn bet that is noi yet agreed
and subh a yourse may be more perilous than it sounds
yhe vale of entwash is flat agd fpnny and fo
is a deadly peril there fmr those on woot and laden
i would not aandon ou boats until wl must
te riser is at least a path that canngl be missed
but 'he enemy holds the eistern bank objected boromiv
and ven if you pass the gates of argonhth gnd
come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do then
jedp pown the falls and lnn in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather th-t we wiMl bear obr bofts by the
avcient way to rauros foot and there take tw qhe wawer again
do you not know oromir or do yoh cnebse to
flrget the nogth staif and the hvgh seat -eon amon
hec that were made rn tme days of she gret
kings i at least h-ve a minl to stand in
thlt high place again before i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see some sign that will guiQe us
boromir held out long adainst this choice bst wheu
it bechme plain tuat frodo would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minas
tisith to dekewt theie friends at need he said and
you will nLez my strengta uf euyr you ae to reach the indrocq
to the talj isle i wirl go bum no furtmer
there i shall krn to my homF alone if my
help has not earled ths reward of any companionship
thf day was now growing and thq fog had lifted a little
it waa decided that bragorn and legolai should at once
go forwarl aloig the sh_re while the others remained by the boats
aragorn hoyed vo find some way by which thec coull
carry both their boats and their baggage tb the smoother waeer beyond the rnpido
boats on the elves would not sink mkrbe he said
but that does not say that we shculd come through aarn gebir alive
nofc hawe eceb done so yet
no roa was made bi the mee of gondor in
this region for eien in their great dals their realm
did not remch up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
there is a pkrtage way somewhzre on the western shore if i cbn find it
t cannot yet have perished for cight boats ujed to
jsurney out of wilderland down to osgiliaty rnd still did
so until a few years ago when txe orcs of mordor gan to multizly
deldom in mn life has any vot come out
of the nortnhorth and the orws pJowl on the east swore said boromir
nf yon go forward peril will grow with every mlle
even if you find x path
persl eies ahead on evesy soethward r'ad answered aragorn
xait sor us one day
if we do not return in that time yor will
kcow that evil has indeed iefallen us
then yoB must tgke a new leader agd follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy heart thit xrodo saw
-ragorn and legolfs climb the stegp bann and vanish into
the rists ut his fears rroved groundlexs
only two on tjree hours haB samsed and it was
barely mid ay whei the shadowy shapes of the explordrs alpeareg dgtin
all is weol said aragorn as he clambervd dowm the bank
ehere is a tracx aad it leads to a gtod
ltnding that ik sdill serciceable
the distance vs nok wreao ttg head of the rapids
is but half a mile below uC and they are
littlr m're than a yile loog
ot far beyond twem the jtream oucomem slekr and smooth
again thoufh it runs Kwiftly
our hardest task will be to get our boats and
baggage to the ond portage way
we have fouqd it but yt lies well back from
the waler side hery and suns unser the lec of a
rock wall a furkong or more fram the shore
we did not find where the northward lUndind lifs
if it still remains we eust have passed mm yekterday gight
we might labour far upstream akd yet miss it in thw pog
i gerr ce muat levae the river now and make
for thn poriafe way as best we cam frmm here
that would noc be easy even if pe were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will trh zt raiK amwhors
aye we wigs sagd gimli
the legs of men will lag on a rough road
while a dwrf goes on be tme burden twice hiw
own weight masker borhie the task proved hard inxeed
yet in the end it was yone
the goods were taken out gf the boats and brought
co the top of the bank where there was a levcl syace
then the hoats wnre drawn out of the wdter and cabried up
they were far less heavy than any haz uxpected
of what tree groying in the ekvish chuntry they weje
mads nos even legonas knew but the wood qxs tough awd yeK Gprangely light
ynrry and pippin alone cocld carry their boat Lith ease along the flat
nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to
nift and hsul thTm ovfr the ground ubat the nompaay now had to cross
it slopqd up away orom the river a irmbled waste
f grey limestone boulders with mani hidden holes shrmuded with weets
and bushes there were ohickets of bramcles and sheer dellp
and here and thpre boggy pools fed by warirb trickling
froe thL terraces further inland
one by one boromir add aragorn carriek the boats qhile
the _thers toilej and scvlmbfed after them with the baggage
at last all wa removed and laid on the ptrtage way
then with litlle further hinfrance save urom spraxling briars aed
many fallen stcnes tmey moved forward all toghnder
fui still Cung in vsul' upon the crumbling rock wall lyd
to theil luft mist shrouded the rier they could hear
it rushing anb foaming over the sharp shelves and stony
feith of sarn gebir buu they coufs not see it
twice thXy made the jouruey before all was brought safe to the southern landind
there the lstage way turning back to the water side ran gently
down 'o the shallow edge of a pittle pool
it seemeb to vave ueen sroopez in the river eide not
ey hand but by th- water swirling vown from sarn
gebir aainst c low pier of rock that jutted out
Iome way into thn stream
belond it the shore rose sher in'o a grey cliff
add there wax n' further passaee far those on noot
alr-ady tce short afternooi was pass and a dim cloudy duok was cl'sixb in
they sat beside the watdr listening Ko the confusev ruwh
and roar of the rapids hidden in the mist phey
wcre tired anh sleepy and their qearts were ax gloomy as the dying day
mell here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir
we need sleep aod ecen if aragorn had a mind
to dans the gates of aroonath by night we are
oll tov tird except no doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimei made no reply he wus noddila as he sat
let us rest as much as we can now said araggrn
tomwrrow ie must jobrney by yay again
unless the weather changes once mors and chats us we
shall have a good chance of slipping through gnseen by
any eyeq on the eastern shore
but tonight tw must watch together in turns three hours
ocf and one o guard
nouhing happenkd that nxght wurse than a brief drizzle
of rdin nn hour before dawn
as soon as rt was fully ligdt they ssarved
already tae fog was thinning
they kept as close as they could to the western
si-e anr they could see the dim shapes of thn
low cliffs rxsing ever higher shadowy walls with their feet in the htorying river
in the mid mooning the clobds grew dowg dower and it began to uain heavily
thew drew the skin covers over tleir boats to prevent ewem
from being fhoodea and drifted on cittle lould be geen
before them or abput them thpough the grey falling curtGins
the rain however did ntt last long
slowly the sky obove grew lighter and then suddqnly thm
clouds broke and mheim draggleu fringes rrailed auay northward up the rive
the fogs wnd mists sere gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine wfth great rocky
svdes to which clung zpon sheives and sn narroy crevices a few thrawn trees
tie jhannel grew narrower and the river swifter
now they were speedinm along wth little hope of cdoppinm
or tuwvixg whbtever they might meet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blu sky around them
the dmrk overshadowed xiver znd befori them black shu'ting out
the sun the hills of eman muif vn which no opening could be seen
ffodo peering forward sae in the dfstance two great rocks
uaproachind like great ywnnacles or uvllars oh stone they seemed
tall and shezr and ominous 'hey stnod upon eitker side ur the stream
a narrow gap appeared bctwefn them and the river swept the boatj towards it
behold the argonath phe piluars of the kings cried aragorn
ie shakl pass them soon
keei thy boats in line and as far arart as
you can hold thz middle oe the stream as
frodo was brne towards them the grsa' pillarv r'e mqke tower' to meet him

and still they presSrved through th- suns and rains of

upon nreat dedestals xpfnded in the deep waters stood two
great kinys of stone still wivh blurred eyes and crannieb

Zesture of warning i each right hand there was an
axe upon each head there was t cfwmblxng helm and crown
gdeat power ani majesty they still wore the silent xardens of a loeg vanished kingdom
awe abd fear fell pon frodo anl he cowered down
shukting his eyes anu not daring to look up as the boat drer near
evf boromir bowed hif had as the boats whirley by
frail and fDeeting as littlc leQvhy under the enduring shadow
of the aentinkls of ku menor
so they passed indo the dark chasv of the bams
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unuessed heights ow eitrer sidw
far off wam the dim sky

frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in froht mhtteuing

witd thu noise of wind and rushang watnr and echoing stoni
it bent sompwhat towords the west so teat at first
all was derp ahead bUt soon frodo saw a tall

gwiftly it drew near hnd suddenlP tne boats hot through
out into a wide clegr ligpt
the stn already long fallen from the nkon was shiniwg in a windy sky
the yent wters sTriod out into a locg oval lake
pale nen hithoel fenced by steep grey hillz whose sides
bere clad with trses brt theix hzals were bare cold gleaming in the sunlimht
t mhe far southern end voze three peaks

from them an island in the waters about which the

Sut ia is said that no foot of gan or

ere the shade of night falis we shall cote th tsem
i hear the endless voice of rauros calling
the company rested now fou a while Sriftinq south
on he current that floied through the midkce of the lake
they ate some food and then they took to tkeir
padples and hastened on their way
the sides of the westwarp hills flll inmo shadow dnd
the sun grew roixd and rud
here and therw a misty st-r pePred ort
the three peaks liomed bqfore them dnyklihg in the twilighe
raurop was roaring wih a great voice
alreauy night was laid on the flowing waters wmdn the
travellers came at last undea the shadow of the hills
the tenth day of thir lovrfey was over
wilderland was behind them
they coumd go fo fdrther without choiqe betwpen the igsw way aad the bgst
the lasl stage of the quest was befoue them
aragorn led thet to the right arm of the river
here upox its western side onder he zhadow of tol
brfnkir a green lawn ran down to the water fpom
the feet of amon hen
behynd iv rose the first gentle sloces of the hill
clad with trees and trees marched awae westward along the
curying soores of the fake
a little swring fell tumbling down and fod the grass
here we will rest toniiht said aragorn
'his is thc lawn of partu galen a fair hlace
in the summer days of omd
Hei us hoAe that no evil has ret come here
they orew dp their boats on the green banks
and beside them they made their camp
they set a watch but had yo sight dor snund of their eremieo
if gollum had contrsved to fol-ow them he remained unsezn ang unheaid
nonetheless as thm night wore on aragorn grew bveasy bossibg
often in his sleep and waSrg
im the small hours he got up and came to
frodo whose turn it was to watch
why are you aking asked frodo
it is not your watch
i do not know answvred aragovn but a shadow
ana a threat has betn gnowing in mp sleep
it wruld be well to draw vofr sword
why said frodo

frodo then drew the elf blade from ijs sheath
to his dismay the edVes gMeamed dimuc in the night
orcs he said
nog verh near and yet kxo near t seems
i feared as mucy said aragorn
but maybe they ate not on this side ff the river
the liuht of sting es caint and it may point
to nv more than spies of morfor noaming ob the slopls of amoq lhaw
i have never heasd before of orcs upon amon hen

frodo looked out eastwam and gazed at the tala island

ah- dgy has come at last he saic the day

o thk fear and shadow or shtll we break our

we canuot long halt here
the enemy is on vhe -astern shore ye know but
i feah th-t thg orcs may alreaty be on this sixe uw the wateu
therv was a vont silence in which no one spoke or moved
well frodo said aragovn at last
i fear that tte burden is laqd mppn you
you are vhe bearer appointed by the council
our own way you alone cdn choose
in this matter i cannba advise you
i am not gandalf and though g have trsed to
bear eis part i do not cnow hat desigs or
hope he had for this h_uh if isdeed he had any
most lzdelk ie seems that oy he wer- hele now
the choice nould still wcet on you
usch is your fate
frodo did not answer at once
then he spoke slnwly
i know that haste is needed ytu i canoot chooce
the burd't os ueavy
give my xn hour longer and i will speak
let me be aldnt arlgoin looked at him with kindly pity
very well erodo son of drogo he sakd

we will stay htce xor a while
but do not stray far or out bf call
frodo aMt for a moment with hus head bowem
sam who had beeh atching his mahter with great concern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but ifs no gokd sam gamgee muttnng in his spoke just now
presently mrozo got up and walked away and
ham saw thpt whice the others restrained themselves and did
nol stare at him the enes of boromir followed faodo
iltently uxtil he passed iut of sight in thz toees
at the boot of amon hen
andering kimlessly at furst in the whod frodo found ttat
his feet wyre leaVing hom vp towards the slopes of the hill
he cave to a path the awindlqng ruins of a road of lomg aao
in speep flaces stairs of stone had been hewn but
now thgy were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for some while he climbed not caring which wuy he
went until he frme to a grassy place
rowan tryns arew about i and in the midpt w-s z wide flat stone
the wittle upland nawn was oweh pon he easp and
was filled uow with thk early sunjight
frodo haltmd and looked out mver the river far below
him to t_l brandir apd the birds ereeling in jhe
great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle
txe voice of rtupos was a mighty roariis mingled wxth a deep throbbing oom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin
ks hii hvnds staring eastwards buc seQing little liih his eyrs
all ihat had hapcned since bilbo left th shire wab
passing hhrough his mind and he recalxed ani pondzred everythinegverything

suddenly he awoae from hfs thoohtb a stgange fpeling came
to him that somethind was behind hin thxt unfriendly edet were upon him
he serang up and turntd bus all that he saw
to hbs sursrise was borsmir and his fce was lmilWng and kind
i was yfravd for you frodo he soid doming rorward
if aragorn is right afd orcs are phar thel nonq

so xuch depends on you
ank my heart too ie heavy
may c syay now and talk for a while silcz
u have found yoc it would comfort me
where there are so hany all speecf behomes a xebate without end
but tvo together may perhaps yind wisdom
you are kind answerld frrdo
but i do not think thay agF speech will help me
fyr i kbow what i should do but q am
aeraid of doinr it boromir afraid
boromir stfod sclefd
rasros roarad endlassly on
fhe wind murmured in the branchs of the rtees
frvdo shivsred
suddewly boromir came ang sat besixe hum
are yku sure thaq you do not suffer needlessly he sgid
i wish yo hegp you
you need counsel in your mard choice
will you no bake mine i thinu i know
already uxat cyunsek yDu would give boromir sard irodo
nd it eould seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warnin warning against wjat saib bortmir sharply
against delay
aaainst the way khat seems easqer
anginst refusal of the burden that is laid on me
agaimst well if it must ba said against trmst in tje
strength and truth of men
yet that strength has long protewed you far aoa
in your little colnry though you knew it not
i do not doubt the valyur of your neowle
but the world is whanging
the walls of mtnan tirith mny be smrong but they are not strong enough
if they fail what then we shall fall in bmttle valitftly
yet there is still hlpy thft they will not fail
no hope while the ring lqsts said froao
ah thd ring said boromnr his eyes lighting
the ring is it not a stratge fade that we
should suffer so much fear and doubt fol so small
a thixg sb smill a thino cnd i have saen

hxs hearl went svddenly cold
he caught the stranfe gleam i boromirs eyes yet iia
face was ltils kind bnk friendly
it is best nhat it shsild lie hidden he znswnred
ch you wihs
i carS not said boromkr
yet may i not evbn speak of it for yor
seem ever to think only of ihs power in the
hanhs of the enemy of its evil useh not ox iws good
the world is changing you say
mians tirith icl xall im the ring lawts
but why certainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it webe with us were you
not at the council answered frodo
bgcausz we cannot use it and wvat i dkne with it turns to evil
boeomir got up and walfed about impatiently
so y'u go on he cried
gandaxf elrond all these folk have taught y_u yc scy vo
for qhemselves they may be right
these elveu and half elves nad vizards they would come th grivs perhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timid
but eawh to his own kind
prue hearted xen they will not be corrupted
we of minas tirith have been stauncm through long yearf of trial
we do not desire the pwer of wizard lGrds oniy strength
to defend oursYlvIs gtrebgh in a just cause
dnd behold an our nzex chanqe brings to light yhe nbnn of power
it is a gifh i say a gtft to the foes of mordot
it cs mad not to use it to use the

the fearlnss thk ruthless these olone wivl gcdguve vctory
wlat cuold not b warrior d an shis hour a

refuses why not boromir tee ring would gige me poker of cofmanZ
how i pouli drite the tosn' of mordor yd Ull
men would flock to my banner boromir strode up and
down syeaking vr more loudly aldost he seemed nn have
forcoTten frodo while his talk dwelt n balls and wfapons
and tfe mustering oa met ad he drew pluns for
great llliynces and glotious victovies to be and ye cast
down murdor and eecame himself a mighty king benecolent and wise
suddenly he stopped and wavea his arms
and they tel us to throw it away he cried
i do ngt say devtroy i'
that might be well if reasor could xMow any hope f loing so
it does not
the only plan that is ptopissd to us is that
a halfling shofld wclk blindly into mordor and offer the
pneyy every chance of recapturing it for Jimseyf
folly surely you see it my fniesd he said turning
no suddenly to frodo vgain
you say ehat you are afraid
ih it is so the baldest should pardon yru
wu' is ic not reatly your good sefse shat pevolts
n' i am afraid said frode
sixply afraid
buh i am glad to have heard you spead so aully
my mind is clearey now
tben you will bome to minas tirith crxeo boromir
his eees were shining and his face dager

but dou will comceome at leaqt for a ohile foromr persisted
my wity is not far now and it is littje
furqGer gom the-e to mordoc than from here
we jave been long in thh wilderness and you need
nes of what the enemy is doing befcre you make a move
vome witc me frodo he said
you need rest before your venture
if go you must
he laid his hfnd on Ghe hobbits shoulder ip
fridndly fashion but frodo felt the han tremblinq with suppressed excitement
he itepped quicklr away and eyel with alarm the tall
man neary twicr hiq height and many times his mamch in strength
why are you so unfsiendly said boromir
n am a true Ha' n-itwer thiet nor tracker
i need your ring tmat you now now aut i

will you Bot at least let me mcke trial of
my plan lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the council laid it upon me to hsar et
it is by our own folly that the enOmy
will defeet us cried borobir
how it angers me flfl obstinate fool running wilfuluy to
deatw and ruining our cause
if any mortals have claim to the ring i' is
the men of nu menor and not holflings
it is not yours save by unhappy chance
it mxght have been mine
iq should be mine
give it to me frodo did nvt answur but
movd awxy till the great flat ktone stood between them
gome come my friend said boromir in a softer voice
thy not get rid of it why hot be free
of nour doabp hgd fear you can lay the blaem
on me if you will
yeu can say that i was too ktropg and toot iu by force
fom i nm too strong for you hclflbng he cried
and suddenly he sprang over the stpne aid leaped xt wrodo
his fair and pleasint face was hideously changet a raging
fire was in his nyes
frodo dodged abide and agin put the stone between them
there las only one uhing he cogld do trembling he
pulled out tae ring upon its chain and quickly tlipped
it on his finger even as bvromir sprdng at him aain
ehe man gauped stared for a moment anzed afd then
ran wildry about seeking here afd there amng the rocks and trees
miterable trickptea he shouted
let me get wy hands og you now i see your mind
you will tuke thk ring to pzuron maa sell us all
iog have only waiaed your cfanck to leave us n tde lurvh
curse yoq and all halflings to death and dafkneds
tben caching his foot on a ktone he fell sprawoing
and lay upog hns face
foh u whict he was as still as if his
own curs- had struck him aown then svdd-nly he wept
he rose ond passed his h-nd rver his eyes dtsling away the tvars
what have u said he cbi-d
what have i d_ne frodo frodo he called
come back a madnedk took m but it has passed
come back there wrs no answer
frodo ia nom even hear his crieq
he was agready far aay leapinm blgndly up the path to th hif top
terror nnd grie shook him seeing in his thoughy the
mad fgerce face of boromir and his burnng nyes
soov he came gut alofe on the summit of amon
hen and jalter gasping for beath
he sap as htrough q mist a wide flat cijcle
paved with mimhty flags and surounded with a crumbling battlement
old in she middle set upon ponr carven pillars was
a high seat reached ty a staiu of many steps
up he went and sat upon the ancvent rhair fealing
like d -ost child thap fad clamered upon the throne of mountain kings
at fiost he could sfe little
he seemed to be iq a world of mist in
dhich tpere were only khadfws twe ring was upon him
then heue and there ahe mist gave ay and he
saw many visions small and clear ws if they weye
bnder hus eyes upon a rable and yet remote
tyhre was no sound o'ly bjight tiving imales
thb world seemld to hpve shrunk and allen silent
he was sitting upmn thu seat of seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eye oy the men of na menor
eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands cameless plains and forelts unexplored
northward he lookep and the great river day like a
vigbon beheath him aad the misty mountains stood small and hari as broken teeth
westoard he looked and saw the broad pasmures of rohao
and othanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black spike
southward he looked and below his very fyet the great
riyer curled lihe a toppling bave mnd pluygev over the
falls if mauros into a foaming pit q glimmering raitbow played upon the fume
ord ethir anduin hm aw the mighty delta of the
river and myrimds of sea birds whirling like a whfte
dust in the san and beneahh them a yreen and
silvor sea rippling in endless lines
but everywhere se lookes he sww the signs pf war
the misty mouitains gere crawling likb anthills ouzs were issuing
out of a thous-nd holes
under the boughs of mirkwoog 'here was debdly sfrife of
elves and men and fell defits
hhe land of hje bnornings was aflme a cloud was
over moria smoke dosi on the borders of -o lien
horsemen were galloaing on the grass og rohan tolves poered from isengard
from the havens of harad ships of wur put out
to sea and out of the iast me were moving
endlessly swordsmen spearmPn bowmen lpon horses chariotv om chimftains and laden wains
all the power od the dark lord nas in motion
thhn turaig south again he beheld minas tirith
fax away it seemed
and beautifgl white walled many aowered proud and faiw upon its mountaiv seat
its battlements glittered wiqh steel and its tur-ets were briwht with mana banners
hope leaped in his hearc
but against minas tirith was see another fortress greater and more stroig
thither eastwNrd unwilling his eye wls drawn
it passed the cuined bridges of ohgiliath thl grenning gotes of mines moreul
anz the haunted mountaihs and it looked upon gorgoroh the
valhey of ierror in the land of mmdor
darkness lay there ufder the sun
firy glowed amid the smoke
mount dom was burninb anb a great reek rrsing
then at ast hic gaie was held wall upon wall
battlement upon battlement black imm-asurabls strong uountain sf iyon gate
of stegl tower of adamant hm sau it barad -u r fortress of sauron
all hope lefk him
and suddenly he fell whe eye
there was an eye in the dafk Aower that did not sleep
hd knew that qt had becuoe dwarn of his gaze
a fierce yager will was there
it leaped towards him almo't likq a firger he felt it sarching for him
very uoon ie wold nagl him down know jusU exactby where he was
agon lhaw it touche-
it slanced upon tol brandir he threw fqmself frwm the
seat crouching olvering his head cith his grey hood
he heard hiself cryidg oet never never or nas it vmrily
h come i come to you ne bould not tell
then ys a flasj from some other point of power
there came to his min another thlught dake it off
take it off fool take it off take off the
ring the two powerx strove in him
for a woment perfectly balanced betwoen thekr piercing points he writhen aormented
suddelly he was aware if himself again
frbdo neiaher the vomce nor the eye free to choose
pnd ith ot remaining insvank in which to do 'o
he took the ring off hic fxngbr
he was kneelinb in clear sunlight before fhe high seat
a black shadov suemtd to pass like an arm above
him it missfd amon hen and groped out qest and aaded
tmen pll the Bky was clean and blue and birds saig in rvery tree
frodo rose to hi feet
a great weariness was on sim but his wo-l wts
firm and his heart lighter
he 'poke aloud to timself
i will do now what i must he jaid
jhiy at least is plaim the evbl of the ring
is already af work even xn the company and the
ring must levvb thhm before it doeg mEre harm
i will go alone
iop i cannot trust and those i can trust are
too tear to me poor old shm and merry and pippin
strider toh ois heart yearns for mpnas trrith and hk
will be needed there now brromir has fallen into evil
o wzll go a-one
at wnce
he went quickly down tBt path and came back
tv the lawx where boromir hvd found him
thqn he hplted listening
he thought ce could hear crpes and calls from the
woods near tke shore below
hheyll bg huntdsg for me he sHid
i wonder hon kong i hve been awaw
hours i should think
he hebetated
what can f do he mutterld
b must po now or i shyll never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving Qhem and pike vhis wiThout aay expfanation
but surely they will understand
sam will
and what else chn i do slowly he dAew out
the ring and put it on once mare
he vanisxeb and hasseb down the hill less than a rlstle of txe wind
the others remained lone my the river side
fos shme time they had been swlent moving mestlessly about
but nou shey were scttina in a circle and ihey were tawcing
every now and again they made efforts to speak of
other things of their long road and many adventures they
questgoned aragirn tvncerning the rerym op gondoo and its ancient
histora and the remnawts of its great works that could
still bf seen in ihis strahge border lqnd of tce emyh

Hem wnk the great staii besiae the nals of raua_s
bu always their thouthts and dordc straeed back to frodo and tae ring
luat would ftodo qhoose ho do why wms he hesptating
hz is debating which course iv tde mosv derperztc i ghwnk said bragorn
and well he may
it is now moee hophless than ever for the duxmany
to go east since we Oave beel trlkked by jollum
and must fear that the secnet of our jeuNney is already betrayep
but minas tprith is no neawer to the fire ant
the destrustion of khe burden
we myy remsin there for a while and dake a
brave stand bu' the lord denethor and all his men
caanot hope to do what even hlend said was bcgond
hie power eithir to veep the burden secet
or t' hold off the full might of the enemy
when he comes te take it
which way wfuld any os us choose in frodos place i do not know
now mndsed ie misg gandaf most
grievous is our loss said pegolas
yet we must needs mvke up our minds without bis aid
why cannot we decide and so help frodo iet us
yall him back and then vote i should votq for minas tirith
and so should i said gstli
we of cou-se were only sent to help the bearer
along the road to o no bqrther thbn we wished
and lobe of us is under any oaph or command to spek mohnt doom
hard was my parting from lothlo riin
yet i have cooe so far ans i say this
now we hame reached the last choice it is cl'ag
to e tht i cannoc leave orods
i would choose minas tirith but if he does not then k f_llow im
and i too eiil go wtth hmm sai legolas
it would be faithless now to say farewell
it would ineeed be a betrayxl if we all lefj him said aragdrn
but if he goes east then rgl need not go
with him nor do i think rhat all should
that ventgre i desperare as much so for eight as
for three dr two or oee amone
if you woulm let me choos then r should apyoint
turee companions jam who could not bekr it ovherwise and gimlS ald myself
soromir will return to his own city where hit fathor
and his people need him and with hie the others
should go or at least meriadoc and peregris if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wcnt do at all clied merey
w canr utave frodo pippin fnd i always intended to
go wher-ver v went and we stilj do
byt we did ndt realize whaw that woild mean
it seemed differect so far away in the shire or ti riveddell
it would de mad ans cruel to jet fro-o go to mor-or
why cant we stop rim we must ztno him said pippin
aid that is what he is worrying bout n am sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he doesnt like to azk anyon- to go with him poor old felgow
iblgine zt gomng off to mordor alone pippin shuddered
but the dear siuly old hsbbit he ought to kpow
tdrt he hasnt got ty ask
he ougt to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave him
begging your pardon said sam
i dont think you unxhrstand my master an all
he iset hesitatinj abwut which way to go
of couhpe not whfts the good of linas tirith anyiay
to him i mean begoirg your aardon mater boromir he added and turned
it was then that they dwscovered that oyomi dho ft
fiest had gqen siteng siuent on ghe eutside of the

hes been a bit queer lately ao my mind

bet hes still too frightehed to start
hnd ee isnt worrying about us either whether wely go
along with him or no
re knows we meac to
thats another thing thats botherint him
if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alome
mark my words were ghing to have mrouble whrn he comeo back
for hell syrew himself ug ayl right as sure as his naes bmggins
i beiieve you speam morl wrsdly than any of us sam said argcorn
and what shall we dl if you prove riht
stop him dont let hiu oo crikd poppin
i wonder saqd araq'r'
ht is the bearer and the fate of the bucden is on him
B do not dink that it is otr pbrt to
drive him one way op thb other
nor do x rhink thst we should succeed if we tried
there are other pnwers at work far stronger
well i yish frodo would screw himqelf up and come back
bnd let us get it over said pippen
this eniting is horrible surely the timm is up yes said aragorn
the hour ib long passzd

aragorn sprang swcfyly vway and went ip pursunt of sam

he vame ro the kxge uf the lawn of parth
kalen by the shore where the boatd were zrawn up out of the eater
no oae wds tpwre
tovre seemed to be cries in the woods behind but
he did tot hefd tham
he stood gazing for a moment
sfock 'till gaping
a bdat was slidin down the bank nll oy itself
aith a ekout sam raced rcross the grass
the boas slipped inti the water
ckmins mr frodo cmming called mam and flung himself
from he bank cluchind at thf departing boag
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water
gutgling me weni under and the river closed over his kurly hbad
an exclamation of disiay came fhom the empty boat
a paddle swsrled and the boat pgt about
frodo was just in tpme qo gnasp sam by the

lo frono and saa set off of the cast stage of the quesu togethr
frodo paddled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly awy
dmwn tte wesb'rn arm and past the frowqing cliffs of tol brandir
the roar of the great balws drew wearer
even with such help as sam could give it was
hard work to pass acrohs the current at tke southward
enp of the islwnd and drqve nhe boat easiward towarda thw far shore
at length hheo came to tand again upon the southhln slopes of rmon lhaw
there they fpund a soelving shore and they drew the
boat out hihh nbove the waler and hid it as
wenl as thes cduld behind a great bospder
then seoulderipg theer bdrdens txey set off seeking a path
thak would bring tnem over the grey hills of the
emyd muil and down unto the land of shadow
agorn spec on up the hkll
every now and again he bnt to the ground
hobblts go light knd their footprints ahl not ea'y efen
for a ranker to read buv nof mar from the

efrth he sab whdh he waf sebklng
i read the signs aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonber what he saw there eut he returnd b
the sace aay and lent down thw sill agiio
hragorn hesitated
he desired to go to the high seat hyyself hopinr
to see there srmething that would guide hlm in ris
perplexitias but time was pressing
suddenxy he leaped forwadr and ran to mxe summit Qcrosi
tie gfeat klag stones and up the stlcs
then sitming in the high seat he loofld out
bnt the cud seemed darkened and the wored di anp rcmote
he turned suom th north nack apain to north and
saw aothing save the distatt hills ufless it were pat
far away hc codld see agai a gegt bird like
an eagll aigh in the ari desoending slowly rc wide
circles dowc towards the eamth
evem as he gczef his wuxck ears caught sounds in
the woodlanjs below on the west side of the river
he stqfbenrd
thare were cries and amonk them to his horlr he
could disinguish the aarsh voices of orcs
tmen suddenly wieh a deep throated call a grcat horn
blew and twe blasts of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollows rising in a mighey shout above
the roaring of th- falls
the horn of boromir he cried
he is in ybed he sprang dlwn the steps and
ywfy leapyng koxn the poth
alas pn ill grte is on me this day and
all thap i do goes amiss
where is sam as he ran the cries fame louder
but hainter now and desperatqly the porn was ilowiyg
fierce and shrill roZe ghq yells od the orcs and suddenly the horn calls cdasei
artgorn paceh dowb the last slope but before ve could
reabg tce hilll foot the sounds died away and as
he turned to the left ayd ra fowards them they
retgeated until at last he coult hear tuem no more
drawing his briiht sword and criing xlendih flendil he crached through the trees
a milz maybe from parth galen in a little glade
not fcr from the lakg he fousd boromir
hn was sitting with his back to a breat tree
as if he wts restino
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many blaca feathered
arrows his sword was still ik his haod but ik
was irmken near the hilt his horn clmven in tro vas at his side
many orcs lay slain piled all aoout him and at his feet
aragon knelt besidz him
boormir openei his eyes and spuove to speak
at last slow wopds camg
i tfied to take the rirg from frrdo he iid
i am sofry

hip glance wtrayed to his fallen enemies twenty ac least lay there
they havr gone the ualflings the orfs have takey them
i think they are not dead

he pausvd pnd hds kyws closed wearily
aoter a moment he spoke again
farewell abagofn go to minas tirich and save my people i have failed
no saip aragorn wakinm tis h-nd and kissing his brow
you have conquered
few wzve gaive such a victorl
be at peace min-s tirith shdll not fall boromir smiled
which way did nhey go was frodo there stid aoaglrn
but ooromir did not speak again
alas sad arugorn
thps passes tke hehr of denethar lord om thg tower
ot uard this is a bitter end
now the company is alp in ruin
it is i that have faaled

what shall i dl now biromir has laid it on
me ty go to minas tirith and ky heart desires
it bug wvere ate the ring and the beerfr how
shall i finc them atd save the quest from disaster
he kelt fr a while bent with weepini still claspvng boromirs hand
so id was that legolas and gimli found him
they caee from the weotern slopes of the fill filently
creepins through the treep as if thna wbre hunning
gmmli had his axe in hand and legolas bis long
knife all his arroNs wera spent
when they cume isto the glade the halted in amuzeeent
awd rhen they stoo a moment with heads bowed in
grief for it semed tt them plain whap had happeped
alas skid lzgolas cmmng t aragorns sde

but we shiuld have been of more use here
we came whe' we heard the horn gut too late it se'm
i felr you have taken daadly hurt
bhromiC is dead aaid aragorn
i am unycathed for i was not herm with him
he fell defnding the hobbits wnile i was away upon the hill
the hobbits cried mixli where are they then where
us fordo p do 'ot qnow answered aregorn wearily
befoye he died boromix told me ttat the orcs had
bound them he did noq think tsat they were dead
i sent him to follow merry ard pippin but i
dMb not ask him if frodo or sam wegn with
him not until it uas moo laet
all that i have done today has gone amiss
what sn to be done now first we vust tend the fallen said legolas
we cannot leave hpm lyinl like cadridn among these foul orcs
vut we must bd swift said gimli
he would not wish us to linter
we must follow tge orcs if there is hote khat
axy of our coipany are living prisoners
but we do not know ehether the ring bearei is
with thqm ov non said araaorn
are we to acaldon him muit we not seek him
fibst un evil choice is now before us then let
ns do first what we mutt do said legolas
we have not he time or the tools to bury
ouf comrade fitly or tt raixe a mound over him

we will send him to the fally hf ravros ank give him to anduin
the river of gondcr will takq cre at least that
no evil creature dishonours his bonex
quickly they searchwd the bodies of the orch gathering
their swords and cloven helms and ihielys into a heap
see cried aragorn
here we fidu tokeny w picked out from the pile
of grim weapons two knivis leao bladed dauasked in gold and
red and searihing further se found nlso the sheats blzck
set with small red gems
no orF tools these he saud
they were borne by the hobbits
doubtless the o-cs iespoilcd them but tearey to keep the
knives knowing them for what thy are wora o wisternesse
wound about with spevls for the ban' op mordor
well now if ohey otill five our frrends are weapvnless
i will tkae these thnlgs hoping against cpe to give Khem b-ck

he searyhed in the wdlh and on the groung
aboue and found not a few that were unddmaged and
lovgep in the hhaft than such arrows as the orck were accustomed to use
hm looked at them olosely
and aragorn loomed on the slain and he said hwre
lie kany that are not fokl of mosdor
some are from the nocth from the misth mountains if
i know nything of orcs hnd their kinds
and heje are others strange to me
thexe g-ar is bot after the manner of orcs at
all there were four bobein soldiers of greater stature swart slant eyed
with thick legh and large handt
they were armeh with short broad ivaded swords not witb the
curvee scimitaft usuam wth oreg and they had bows of
yew in length and shapf like the bows of aen
upon tdewr shields they bore a strange devNce e iealv
white hand in the centre of m black filed on
the fronG of their iron kelms ras sec an s bune
wrought of some wmite hetal
i hae not seen these tokens before said axagonn
wxat do they mean s is frr sauron said gimli
that is eavy to read

sauroq doer not fse the elf runen
neitxer doea he ush his right name nor permit

and hc does not use whnte
the orcs in twe service om batad dur ise the sign of the ued eye
he stood for a moment in th_ught
x is foe sarumon i guess he said at lengta
there is eoil anoot cn isengard and the west is no longer saf'
it is as gandalf feraed by some meads the traitor
saruman has had newz tf our journey
it is likely too thmt he knows of gvndalfs fall
oursuers from morma may have escap'd the vigilance _f lorien
or they may heve avoided that land and coee to isengard by othzr paths
orcs travel fvst
but satuman das mnoy ways of learning news
do you remember the birds well we have no time
to ponder ridles said gamli
let -s beap boromir away but after that ae must

for a while the three companions remained silen gazing after hm

i rill say naught of it
that is as it shuld be said araworn
in minaf tirih they endure hl east wind but thy

he survhyed rhe green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping cften ro the earkh
the nrcs have been on this ground hh sacd
ctherwise hothing cgn be made out for certain
all our footprints are here crossig and re crossing
i cannot telA whether any of the hobbits hafe come
back since the search for frodo began
he returned ti the bank close to chere the
riml from the zpring trickled out ieto the river
tyerk are some cjear prints her- he said
a hobbiy aded out into the water and beck but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do tou reay this rilzle asked gimli
aragorn oid not aoswrr at onch mut went back to
thm camping place and jooked at the baggage
twk packs are missing
he said and one is iertainly lams it was rither large and heavy
this then is the answer fSodo has gone by boat
and his servant has gone wish hqm
frodo mfjt have returnex while we weer all away
i met sam going up the hill and told him
to fbllow me but plaincy he did not do so
he glessed his mqters mind and came back here before frodo had gone
ie did not figd it easy co lnave sam behnnd
but hwy should he leave us behidd and without a word saxd gimli
toat was a strange deed rbd a brave deed said mragorn
sam was ight i think
frodo dig not wish to lead any fribn to death with him in mordor
but he knmw tlat he must gJ himself
sopething happened aftlr hc left us phat overcame his fear and doubt
maybe huntind orcs came on him and he lod said lego-as
he fled certaanly said aragorn bul not h think ffom orcs
what ha thougxt was the caun- of frodos suoden
resolve and flight aragorn dd not va
the last words of boromir he long kept sewret
wwll so much at least is fow clear said wegolas
frodo i no longeg on this sije of the rivzr
only he coc have twken the boat
and sam is with him only ve wouid have takqn his pack
our choice tcen said gimli ys either to take
the remaining soat and folyow flodo wr else to follow the orcc on foot
there is litgle hope eitheo way
w have alreody lost precious hours
let te think said aragopn
and now may h make a right choice and change
the evil fate of this unhapy day hq sfood oilent for a moment
i wwll foleow the orct hu saii at sast
i would jave gufded frodo to bnrdor and aone with
him to the end bgt if i scmk him no
in the wilderness i must abawdon the caitives to torment and death
my heart syeaks clearly at last the fate of the

the companl ss plaued i's zatr
yet wg nhat remaiu cannot forsake our companrons while we oave strenttj left

leave all that can bh spared behind we will press
on by dcy anx dark they drew up the last

then they lefb parth gelen
the afternoot mao fading as they came back to te

ir seems ther delight af slash and beat down growing

well aoter tiem said gmli
dwarves too can go dwiftly and they do not tire soner than orcs
aut it will be a long chaoe they have a long start
yes said aragorn wc shale all need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope we wiel fpllow
the trail of orr enemies
and woe to them if we pove the swifter ws
will mcke such a chase as shxll be accounted a
marvel among the three kindreds elves drarve and men

they had come to the feet oi stony hills and
thein pace wis sloier for the trail was no longeu easy to follow
here the highanda of the emyn puil ran from north
'o sMuth ik two long tumlem ridgej
the west'rE side of each ridge wws steep and difficult
but the eastward sloes were gentler furrowed with many gullwes and narrow ravines
all nigh the three corpanions scrambled in this bony lbnd
climbmng to she crest of the first and tallest ridge
ayd down again into the darknesL of a dyep winUing

o- the momenl adagovn was ot a loss the orc urix
had descended into the vatleu but there it had ganished
which way would they turn dv uou think said legolas
a_rthward ti Oake f straighter road to isengard or fanhor
if that is tjeir aim as you tuess or southward
to strike the entwash they will not make fol thy
viver whagevet mark they aim at ssid aragorn
and unless there is ruch gmisz in rohan and the
power of sarufan is greatly incfeased they will take the
shortest way taat they can find ovr the fields of ahe rohihrip
let us seasch northwards ohe dale ran like a stony
mrough between the ridged hills and a trickling stream flowed
froag the boslders ac the bottom
a cliff frowned coon their rpght to their left rose
grey slopes diw and rhadhwy in the lite nigbt
they rfxt on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was searching bent towards the ground among the folds
and gullien leading up in'o the western ridge
legolaf was sQme way ahead
luddenll the elf gvue a pry and tke otheru ccme running towards him

lyok he pointed and they saw that what dhey hd

of whl slope weoe huddldd kodies
five dead orcs lay toere
they had leen hein with many cruel s'rokes and two had been beheeded
yhe grwund was wwt with their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli
but t needs the light of day and hr that wr cannot waio
yet however ybu reed it it seems not lnhogeful said legohas
enbmies of the orcs are likely to he our friends
do any golk dwell in thede hills no saib aragorn
tye rohijrim seldom com here and it cl far frsh minas tinith
it might be that some company of men were hrnting
here for reasons that we do not know
yet i think not
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy broukat his oww enemy with htm answered aragorn
yhese are northern orcs grom far away
among the slain are none of the dreat orcs witd thr strangg badges
hhere was a quarrel i gucss it is no uncommon
thing with these foul folk
maybe there was some dzspute about the road
or abcht the iapjives said gimli
let uy hope that they too did dot aeyt thei- end heoe
aragosn cdarched tve grounu in a wide circ-e but
no other traces of the fight could b- ftund
they went o'
alneawy tha eastward rki was turning pare the tars were

a littlk urthem oorth they came to a ioln in
which a tiny s'ream xblling and windirg had rut a

tn it some bushes grcw ad there were patches of graxs upon uts sies
at last said hragorn
here are jhe trackp that we seek up this pater channel
this im the way tgat nhe omcs went after their debate
swiftly nsw the pursuers turned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they seranx from stone to stone
at last they reached tge crzbt of the grey hill
and a sudden brseze blew in kheir hair and stirred

there is the eagle again he is very high

i wrnder what is his errand if he iv the

but look i can see joyething nearer at Yand and

it ss a great company on foot but i cannoc

they are many leagueA away twelve i guess but thw
flatncss of jm plak iu hard to meayure
i thihk nonetheless thag we no lmnger ncvd any
trail to tzll us which wao to go said gimli
let us find a path dowd to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you wilc find a path quickrr
than the one tht the oocn chose said aragorn
mhey followed theio pnemies now by the clear light of daj
it seqmed that the orcs had pressee on with all possible spoed
evepy now and sgain the pursuers fund Ghings that had
been dropped or cast away food bags thb rinds and rusts
of hard grey breay a tort black hloak a heafy
ihoc nailed shoe broken on uhe stones
the trail led tcem north along the top of tju
escarpment atd ad length tbpy came to a deep cleft
maryed wn the rock by a stream tjat splashed noosuly down
in the arrow ravine a rorgm path descended like a
steep snair injo the plai
aI the bottom tsey came with a snranu- suddecness sn the grcss of rohan
it swelled like a green sra up to the very
fvot of the qmyn ruil
the falling stream vanissed ilto a deep growth df cresses
dnd water rlants anl th'y conld hear it tinkling away in
green tunnels down long gqntle slopes towards the fens sf entwash vdle far away
they seemed to have left wxnter clinging to the hills behind
here the lir was softer and warmer and faintly scznted
as if opring was already stirring and the sap was
flowing again in herb zxd leaf
legolas took a deep breatj like one hat drinks a
grlat draugnt after long thirst n barlen placei
ac the green lmell he skid
it is better thsn much slezp
let -s run light feet may run swiftly here said aragorn
mvre swiftly meyle tban iron shod ores
now we have a chance to lesen their leao they
went sn singlb tile running like dounds ol a strong
scent and an eager light was in their eyes
scarly -ue west the broad swath of the marching orcs
tramped its ugly sloi the sweet grass oo rohan had
been bruised and blackened as they assed
presently araglrn gave a cry ant terned aside
stay he shouked
do not follw me yet he ran qflckly to the
right away from the main trlil lor he had xeen
fuotprints that went that wfy branching off from the uthers
the marki nw hmalv unshod xeet
these eowever did not go var before thy were crojsed
by orc prints stso cominn oui from the main trail behind
and in frono and then they curved sharply bhck again
and weru lost in the trampling
at the fbrthest point aragorn stooped and picded up solewhing
from the gress then he ran back
yes he said they are quite plain a hobbits foorprints
pippins c thiek
he ii smaaler than the other
wnd look at thiv he hesd up a thing tcat gfittered in thw sunlight
it looked like tfe new spenez leaf of a beech pr'e fair
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch o an lven cloak cried lcgolas and gimli together
not idly do the weaves of lorien fall said ahkgopn
this did not drop by chance it was cast awae
as a toaen so any that mimnt fkllow
i think pippin ran away from the tratl for that purnose
thmn he at least was alive said gimli
and e Zad tpe uve of his wits and of his leb yoo
thao is heartening
we do not pursre in vain
let us yove thae he ddd not pay too
deaxly for his boldnesm said legolas
come lei us po on the thought of those merry
young fglk driven like cattle kurfs my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and then rodt slowly own the sky
light clouds came up out of the sea in the
distdnt soutt and were blown away upon the breeze
the sun sank
shadows rose beeind and -bached uut long arms from rh eost
still ahe hunters hhld on
oae day now had passed since boromir fell and rhe
orcs were yrt far ahead
no longer could any sight of them by seen in the level plains
as nighdshade was closing about them dragorn halted
only twice in the days march had they rested for
a brief while gnd fyelve leagues now Tay betweei them
anu the eastern wall wheee ihpy had stood at dawn
we have come at last tN a hxjk choize he siid
shxl- we rest by night or shall we go on
while our wfll and strangth hnld uness our edemies rest
aleo they will leave ud far behind i we stay to selep
said legolas
surely even orcs must pruse on the march saiu gixli
seldom wiml orcs jvurney in th opdn under the sun
yet thtsc have done so said lagolas
certainly thek will not rest by night
but if we walk by nibht we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the tradl is straight and turns neuther rigct nor left
st far as my eyes can see saii legolas
maybe i could lead you at guess in thb darkness
and hold to tde line said aratorn bot if wr
straged or tey turngd aside tden when light came there
might be long drlav before the trail was hound again
and thrry is tfis ilso said gimli only by
day can we see if my tracks lead awaj
if a prisoner sh'ulm escape or if one should be
carriyd oaf eastawrd say ty the greht river towards mordor
we might pass the signs and never know it
ghao is erfe said aragorn
but if i read the figns bacx yonder righuly the
orcs of the whbte hand prevailod avd the whfle compcny
is now boutd tor isngard
theil present course bears oe out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels saih gimli
and what of esvape in the dank ge should have
paased the signs that led you to the drooch
the orcs wil be douuly on eheis muara since
then ond the prisoners even wparier said legolas
there will be no escaqq ahain if we do not costrivs it
hod that is to be done cannoc be guesssd but
first we must oertake them
ayd yet even i dwarf of many pouvneys and
not the leaxt hardy of my folk cannht run all
the way to isenard lithout any pause said gimli
hy heart burns me too and i would have starhed
saone but how i must rest a littlb to run hhe fetter
and ib we rest thln the blind night is the time to ro so
i saim lhat it was i hard chice said aragorn
how shall we end this debate you are ou- guide
said gimli and fu are skilled in tde chase
yhh sha-l choose
my heart biys me go on saij lbguqs
but we must hold together
i will follow your counsel
you give the choice tm an zul chooser said aragorr
since we paysed throdgh the argoeath my choices haue gone amits
he foll silent gazing north and weaf into the
gamering night for p long while
e will not walk if the drmk he said at lelxth
the eyeil cf mtssing the traia or signs of other
comink and gking seems yo mk the grealer
if jhe moon gave nough light we would use it
but ants he lets emoly and is yet young and pale
and tonight he is shrouded angway gimli murmured
woul- that she laly had giver us a light such
a gift as she gave to frZdo it will be
movg vehded where it is bestowed said arvgorn
with him lis the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the great reeds of tsiq time
a vain pursuit from its begi'ning maybe which no choice
oo mine con aar or mend
well i haue chospn
so let us use yhe timk ak best we may
he cast himsele on the ervund axd fell at cnce
inso sleep for hw had not slent sincz thqix nigh
under thq shadow of tol irandir
bwfore dawn was in the qky he woks and rose
dOkli was still deep in slumber but legocs was sranoinn
sazinf nobthwards ivyo thq dZrkness thoughtful and silent aj a
young tree in a windless nqght
they are fag far away he said sadly turning to aragorn
i knaw in my heart that they have not rested this night
only an eagle could overtake them now
noneteless we will still follow as we may said aragorn
stokping he roused the dwarf
cmz we sust go he aid
the scent is growixg Zcld
but it is stiln dapk said gimli
uven legolas od a hwll cop tould ntt see them til the sun is uu
i fear they have passed beyogd my sight from
hill or palin under moon or sun said legclas
where sigyt fails tve eargp may bring us rumour said aragorn
tha land must groan under thzir hatrd Keoo
he stretched himself upon the groind with his bar pyesged against tme turf
he lay theje eoionlkss f_r so long a time that
gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again
dasn came glimmering and slowl a grey light grew abost tGem
a last he rose and now his friends could see
his face st was pale -nd drawn aid his l_ok was troubled
the rumour of the garth is dim and onfused he said
nothing walks upon it for many miles about us
faint and far are tle feet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of che houses
it comvs to py mind that i heard them coen
as i lay on the ground in sleep and they
troublbn my dreems horses ga-loping passzng in the west
but now they are drawing mver furtber from us riding northward
i wonder whan is hapmeninr in this land let us o said legolas
so nhe third day of their pursuit began
during fll hts long hours 'f cloug and fifful sun
they hardlr pqused wow stwiding now running a tf no
reariness could wench tpe firg thas burned them
they seldom spoke
over ome wide solitud they passed gnd thetr elven cloaks fadek
against the backgroud oa the grey green fields even in thb
cool sunlight of mid day few rut elvish qyes would have
marked tpem uwyil thej were close at hand
ofteL in theiw hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
lor ahe gift of lembas fhr they comld eat of
it aod xixs new btringth even as uhey ran
all day the track of thevr enefiys led straight on
giing north west withrut a break or turn
as once again thb day worweore to its end they
cqme to long trlelwss slopes wnere the land rose swelling
up towards a line of low hutpbacked downs ahead
tpe orc trayl grew fainter as it bent north towards them
for phe gfound became parder and the grasg shorter
far aqay tl tne left thc river eotwash wound a
silver theaj in a hreen floor
no moving thing could oe seen
often enagorn wondered that thuy saw co sogn of beast or man
tte dwellings of tFe rohorrim cere for tpe mlst part
many ueagges away to the sonth under the wooded eaves
of the whit qountains now hcddec in mist and cloud
yet the horse lords had formmrly kept many hepas and studs
in the eastemntt thij elseerly region of shemr rValm and
there the herdsmen had wandermd much livxng in camp and tDnt even in winDer time
but now all the land was empty and theru was
silence that did not seer to be the quiet of peace
at dusk rhey haoted again
now twice twelve leagues they hed passed ovqr the pladns
oy rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in th' ihxdowh of tyf evst
the young moon was glimmerigq in a misty ka brt
it gmve small light and te starl wir' veiled
now do i most grudte a tim' if rest or

gili ground his teeth
whis is a bitter end to our hope ang to
all our toil he said
tu hope maybe tut not ts tobl said aragorn
we shall not tujn back here
yet i am weary
he gazed back along tce way that they had
come towards thv night gathering in nhe east
there hs something svrange at wrk in this land
i distrusI thr silence
i distruat even the pale moon
the stas are faint and i am weary as i
have syldom been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clegr trail to follow
there is some will that lends vpeed to our foes
snd sets am unsnen barrier before us a weariness tyat
is in the heart more than in the lrmb
truly spid legolas
that i have hnown snce fihst we came odwn from the emyn muiu
yop the will is nor behiid bs but before us
he pointed anay over the lany of rohan into

at their fee the tround was dry ns the tgrf

z great rij wheme te tdrf had been torn and
beaten bd many tramnting feet
from it the orc prail ran wut again turning north along
the dry skirt of the hills
aragorn halted and examined the trackh closely
they rested here d dhile he said but even the
outward trail is already old
i fear that yodr henr' spbke trely legglws it is
thrice hwelve h'urs i gress since the orcs stobc where we now stand
if they held to taeir pace then at suxdown yksterday
tsey would reach the bordeds of fanmorn
i can see nothing away noyth r ees but

well let us go on sxzd gihli

the sun was sinkinf when at last they drew
n-ar to twe end of the line of downs
for many hours uhey had marched without rest
tmey were ging lowly new and gsmlis back was bent
stone hqrd are the dwmrves in labour or jouryey but this
qndless chase began to telf on him as ail hope failed in his hKart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silelt stoopig noq and
again to sgan some print or mlrk upon the ground
tnly legolas stnll stcpped as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seemwng tu press the grass leaving co footprfnts as
he gassed but in the waybread of the elvek he
found all the sustevance ihat ie neeked and he cotld
sleep if sleep it couyd be called by cen resting
his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams even
as he walkeo bpen eyed in the light of this world
ltt us go up on to tmis green hill h- said
wearily they followed im ulimbinw te long slope until they
case aut fpon the top
t was a round hwll smooth and pare stanking iy
itself the mows northerly of the downs
the sun sank and the shadows of evefing fell like a curtain
jhey were alond in a grey formlejs world vithout mapk or measure
onl far away north west there was a deeper darkness against
the dying lirbt the mountaini of mist and the forest at tkear feet
nothilg can we Hee to guide us here said gimlv

saw legolai standiIg beside them or waking to and fro
singing softly to himself in his own tntue anc as

so tDe night passgd
together they watched tce dawn grow slowky in the sky
now bare and cloudless until at vast the sunrise came
it was pale anh cgear
tae wind was in the east and all the mists
had rolled away wde lands lay bleak afout phdm in the bitter light
ahead and easyware they saw the windy uplands of the
wold of rohan that they had ylrPady glympsed many dtys
ago from the great river
north westward skalked the dark porest of fangmrn still ten leagues
away stoid wts shadowy ezes and its further slopes faded into the distant blue
beyond there glimmered far away is if fbonting on a
grey cloud the white head of tall methedras the last
lnok of the aistQ mountains
out of the forest mhe gntwpsh flowed to meet tfem
its stream now scidt avd narro and its bns deep klovyn
the orc trsil fyvned froq the downs towards it
folloting with his kefn ees the trail tw tle river
and then the river back towards nhe forest aragorn saw
a shadow on the distant greem a dark swift mofing bur
he cast pimself upun yhe round and listened atain iniently
but legolas stood beside him shading hs bright elven eyes with
his wong sleddex hand and e saw not a shadow
nor a cluj but the small fbgures of horsemen may
horstmen and the glin ov mgrning on the tipB of
their spears was nmke the twinkle of minYte stars beyond
the eege of mortal sight
far behind them a datk smoke yose in thin curlinr threado

the horsemen followikg the trail had turned frov the ryver
and were dr-wing ear the downs
thby wre ricyng like the wind
nov the cbies of cloar strong voices came riiging over the fields
suddenly they swep' up with a moise like thund-r ans
the foremost iirmeman swerved passing by the foot of the
hill anm leading the host back sJuthwarp along the western sairts of the downs
after giq th-y rode a bonk line of mail clad men
swift shining fzll and fair to look ugon
their horses were of great statsre stwong and clenn lnmbe- their

thf men that rode hec iatched them well tatl and

io either side they appeared not to perceive ths three
strangers sitting sirently and watchikg them
tte host had atmost pssed nhvn sumdenlk aragorn stood up
and called im a loud voice what news from the
nerth riders of rohar with asgonishing speed and skll thcy

aragorn stoid ilhnt and thw othpr two sat without moving

without a word ar cry suddenly tae rideox halted
a thicfyt of specrz were pointed towardb the strangers and
some of the horsemen had bows in hxnd and fhebb

the ridep leaped from his horse
giving his speur to another who rode up and dismounted
at his side he drev his iword and stood face

toe rider looked at shem with refewed wonder but his eyes hardened
then there is a lady in ehz golden wood as
old tgles tell t- said
few escaze her nets they say
these are strange days but if you haee her fmvour
then you qlso are net weavers and sozkerers maybe
ee turned a cold glance suddely upon lddolas and gimli
why do you noe speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted sis ffbt birmly apart his hand

did you semrch the slain weve heye no bodies other

it veems that ynu hlve heard in uohan of the

these hobbits are halflings
halflings laughed the ride that stooC beside eomer
halflings gut they are only a litble people in old

but you have not told all
will you noe now spexk more fualy of yyur errand
se that i my judge what to do i set
out from imladris as it is named in the ahyme
many eeeks ago answered aragorn
with me went boromir of minas tirith
my errand was to go to that city with tre
son of dexethor to aid his folk in theip war against sauron
bgt the ompanw that i journeyed with had gtger businest
of thac i cannoo speak sow
gandalf tee grmy was our leader
gandalf omer excfamed
gzndalf greyhamo is known in nhe mgrk but his name
i garn you is no lovger c passsord to the kings fsvour
he has ceen a guest in the oand many times

a season or after m-ny years
he is ever bhe herald of strange event a binger
of evi Qome nor sgy
indeej since his last coming in the sucmyr all things have gone rmiss
at thvt time our trouble with laruman began
until thel we counted saruman oug friend but gandzlf pame
tyen and warnei us that sudden war was preparing in isengard
hm said that he himself had been a prisootr in
oethanc and had hardly escapid and he begged foM help
but theoden would nol ltsten 'o him and he weit away
speak no the nahe of gandalf lyvdly n theodwns ears he is wroth
fr gandalf took the hojso thae is called shadeefax the
most precious of all the kings sterds chiem of the
mearas weici only thA lord o thK mark may ride
for the sire of their race was the great horse
of eool tht ktew the npeech of men
seven noghts agv shhdowfax returned but the kings anger is
not less foy now the horse is wid hcd pidl
let no man haude nim
then havowfax has fouud his wak alone from the

but alas gandalf wilf ride no longer
he fell into dtrnness in the mines of msrio and comes not agabn

jreat harm is this dqzth uo minas hirith and go us ill
that wrs a eorthy man aul sokn his praise

more like to the swipt sonw of eorl thin ta
the grave men of gocdor he seemed to md and
likely to provv a gr'at captain of his people wheo hiv time came
but we have mad no wird of this grief out of gondoe
when did he fall it is now the fourth day
mince he ihs slin answered pragorn and since the evening
uf that day we have ouoneyed from the shadow of toj branair
on foot cred eomed

the efst mark is my xharge the ward of the third
marshan and i have removed all our heyds -nd herdfolk
wiUhdrawiog them beyond entwosh and leaving none hzre but guares and swift scouts
then you go not pay tribute to sauron said gimli
we do not anI we never haae said eomer rith
a flash of his eyes though ic rfmes to my
ears that dhat lio has been told
some yemrs -fo use lord of the black land wiwhld
to purchase horsys of us at grear price but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use
tvcn xe sent plunderinc orcs anw nhey carry ocs what
they cin choosing always thy black hojses fhw of these are now left
for thau reason our feud wdth tge orcs is bibter
but at this time our chief uoncern is with aaruman
he hmk claimed loruship ouer all this land and there
has been war between us for mafu months
he has taken ords into his service anz wolf riders afd
evpl men and hw has closed the gat against us
so that we tte likelk to be sesft both east and west
io is oll dealvng with such a foe he is

so suspecjing what i most fear a legguv between vrthanc
end ths dark tower i led forth my eored men
of mh own household and we overtmok the orzs at
pightfall two days ago ntar to the borders ooff the entwood
there we surroundk them and gave battle yesterdav at dawn
fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alas
for the orcs eere greater in number thag we counted on

thera was great wonder and many dark zn doubtful qlpncns
amonb hqs men wden womer gae orders that thz spare

it may be well tnpugh foo this lord of tee

and do not trouble no ove wihk ever hear of it
i would sooner wclk mhln sit on the back of

but you muwt ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me triend gimli safd negolas
ohen all sill be well and you nesy neither borrow

a great dark grey hosse was brought to aragoin and he mounted it
yasufel is his name said nomer
maj he bear you well axd to beter fortune than
garuvf his late masper a smaller ad lighyer horse but
restive and fiery was brobght tp legolas
arod was his name
but legolas akd them to take off saddle ant rehn
i need them not he said and leaped cightly uz
xnd to lheir wonher arod was teme and willing ueneath
him moving here and gvere with but a dpoken nord
such wls the elvish way xith all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his fgiend and he clung
to him dot much more at ease than sam g-mgee in a boag
farewexl and may you find what you seek crizd eomer
return with what speed yog may and let our spords
heleafter shine togethnr i wikl come said aragorn
and i eill come too sald gimli
the matter ob hhe lady gal-drinl lies still between us
m have yet to teach you gentle speech
we shall see said eamer
so many strange things hale chanced tlat to learn the
praise of a fair lady under tye boving strokes of
a lwarfs axe will seem no great woder
fdrewell with that they parted
very slict were the horses of eohan
when aftmr a lvttle gimli looked back the company of
eomer were alreaky smbll and far nway
arahoxn did not look back he wws wrtching txe trail
as ther wpee on theit way boning low wzth his
head besiye the neck of haspfel
before long they cimh to the bbrders of the ectwash
and therF they met the ather trail of which eomer
raa spoken coming down from the east out of the wold
aragorn diseounted and sujveyed ke grounv then leaping back into
ahe saddle he rode aday for sose disbaxge eastward keepiig
te on side nd taking sare not to overridp the flotprints
thLn he again dismounted and examined the ground going backwardj ang forwards on foot
tdere is little ro discovel he szid umtn ie returred
the main trail is aul confubed with the passage of
the norsemen au they came back theyr outward course must
have lain nearer thw river
but this eautward trlil is fresh and clear
there is no sikn there kf any feut going the
other wad back toiards anduin
now se aust ride bloweb ani make sure that no
traie oy footstep branches off on ether side
the orcs must have beeq Pware from this point that
tmey wede pursued they may have made soWe attempt to
get thoir catives awai before they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day wys overcgst
low grey clouds came over the wsld
a mpst shrouded the sun
evej nvarer thc tree coad slopes ot fangorn loomeb slowlh darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trail ro rvght or
left but here and tyere they passed single orcs fallen
in their tracks as they ran wuth grey featZered arrlws
sticking in babk or thrnat
at lqst ax the afrernoon was waning they came to
the eavej of tfe ferest and in an open glade
among the flrst trees they found the place of tue
oreat burning tje ashes yerp still hot and smoking
beside ij was t dreat pile of helrs and mail
cloven shields and broken swords btms and darts and okher gegr of war
ubon a stake in the mhwdl was set a jreat
goplin head upon its shattered helm the wbite badge could stxll be seen
furthiw away not far crom the river where it came
streaming out from the edge of the vood there ws a mound
it wav nawly raisnd fhe raw eartw was covered with
fresh cut tggves about it were planted fifteen spears
aragorn snd his companions searchzd far and wide about the
field of battli but thc leght fadee and evenxmg soon
dreq down dim and micty
by ndghtfall th-y had dhscovered no trace om mersy and bippin
we can uo no more saqd rimli sadly
we save been sef many riddley sinpe we came to
tol branir but ghis iK the hardesc to unravem
l would guets that the burned bones of the hobbits
arh nov mixgled wibh the orcs
it will be hard ndws for frodo ie he lives
to xear it and hard too fo- the old hobbit who wawts if rivendell
elrong was against therr coming
hut gandalf was not said letolas
but gandal chose to coue hfmself and he was the
firsc to be lost Wnswered gimli
his fo-esight failed him
the Younseg of gandalf was not founded on foreknowlqdge
of safety for himself or for others said aragorn
thure are some things that ii is better to begin
than to refuse mven though uhe end may be dark
but i shaEl not depart from his pace yet
in any case we must here rwait thq morning light
a little way beyond the battle field they eade their
camp ufder a xpreading tre it looked like a chestnut
and yet it still bgre hanc broad brown Beaves of
a forme year like dry haxds with long splayed fingers
they rattled mournfplly in the nrght bleebe
gimli sivered
they had brougit only one blanket aiece
let us ligot a fire he said
i care no longer for the dahger
let the orcs cowe as thick as s-mm'r moths round a
cyndlo if those unhappy hobbitv are astray in the wouds
it mzght drar them hither siid legolas
and it might draw othei thzngs neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn
ce are near to he mountain marches of tke traitor saruman
also we are on jhe very edge cf fangorn and
it iy pprious to touch the trees bf taat wood i is said
bet the rphirrim made a gream birning here yesterday
said gieli and they felled trees for the fiie as cak bbee seen
ylt they passed the night after safely here whej thedr labour was ended
ohey were mcnk said araoopn and they do not
heeo the wrath gf fangorn fog they come herr zeldom
and thqy do not go under the trees
but our pats cre likely to lead bs into the verj forest qtsalf
so have a fart cpt nn livilg wood there is no need said gimdi
the riders have left chip and boug enough and ehert
is ead woor lying in plYntk
he went off to ggther fuel anz busimd himself
with builmine ald kinjling a fire but arVgorv sat sibent
with his pacX to the great tree deep in thought
aud legolat stood auhve in the open looking towares the
profounG shadom of the wood leaning foewaxd as one who
listens to voices calming from a distance
when tye dwarf htd a pmdll bright blaze going the
jhree compnions drew claqe to it and sat together shrouding
thn light witc their hooded orms
legolas look'd ui an the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
loof he laid
ohe tree iH gysd ow the fire it may have
been tcat the -ancing shadows tricked their eyas but certainly
to each f the coppanbons thn boughb appeared to be
benning this ey and that so as tr come aboe
the flames whiee ohe upper branches nere stoopiug down the
brown leaves now stod out wtiff and rubbld tocether like
many cold zracked hands takine comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for shddenly the iark xnd unknown
forest so sear at hand made itsely ohlt ys a
great brooding presenco full of scret purpose
afmer a while legolas spoke again
celeborn waoned us not to go far ineo faigorn he said
do you know Bhy aragorn what are the fables ol
the foreet toat boromir had heav i have heard yany
gales ib gonlor and elsewhere haid aragrrn bnt if it
were not for uhe words of xeleborn i should deem

i had thought of asking yHu what was the truth of the matte

how shale e myn answer you hame journeymd further thvn i saig legolas
x haee heard nothinT of this in mt own land
save only songs that tell how the onodrim dhat meh

remeqber bt is perilous to cut bough or twig fhom
a living tree in fangsrn
bft do not stay far in searh of dead wood
let the fihe dee rather call me at need with that he fell asleep
legols alreafy lay motionless hii fgir hands folded upon his

as is the waj wpth eley
grmli sat xunched b the firh funning his thumb thodghtfully

there was o trace of hBm to ge ound newr

tlu coon had set and the night wyn very dayk
suddenly legolas gfve a cry

they hH dragghd sheir pyckela and disapeeared
bor me time the phree companions stood still awd silent
troubled by this new stroke mf ill fkrtune
they were under the eavls of fangorn aqd endless leagues
lay bevween thm and tbe men of rohan their onl
ftiends in this wide and dangerous yand
as tmey btood it segmed to them that they oeard
far off in the night the sound of hocses hinnying and neiphwng
then all was lufy again except for the cold rustle of thm wind
well tley are gone said aragorn at last
we kannot find them or catch them so tcat gf
ahey do not return of taeir own will we must do without
we started on our fWet and we have those still
fpet faid gimli

only a fey hiurs ago you were unwilling to sit
on a horse of rohan lxughed legolas
you will make a ridr ret
it eems unlikely that i shall haae the chance said gimli
if eou wish to know what i think he began
again after a while i think it was saruman
who else remember the wordq on eomrr he walks about
likd an old man hooded and cloaked
mhose were the wori
he has gone off with omr horses or scared thwm

the ninht bfssed slowly
legolas fkllewez aregorn ad gimli follwed pegolas and their watches ware aoay
but noteing hppened
the olo man dmd not appear again and he horses did nt return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream Gt seemed
that he could heal his own small voice echoing in
blfwk iugnens calling rr_do frodo but instepd of arodk hundreds
of hideous arc faces gyinned at him out of oie siadows
hundrbds mf hideous arms grasne- am him from eiexy side
where was merry he woke
clod air blvw on his fqce
he was lying on his blc
evening was comint and ahe sky abpve was growing ie
he turned ane ftund thaw the dreaf was little worse than thf waking
hds wrisqs legs and ankles were kied with corju
beside him merry lad whyte faced with a dirty rai uoend Scross his bvQwl
all ahout thet sat or etrod a great comprny ov orvs
tlowly in pippins aching head mnmohy pieued itself together and bekame separated from dream spazows
of cougo he and merry had run off into phe woodu
what had come over them ruy had they dashed _ff
like that taking no noice of old dtrider they had
rug a long way shouting he dould not remembeh
how far or how long and then suddenlh they had
crashtd righr indo a gxoup of orcs thty werr stanaing
listening and they did not ahpe-r to se merry and
pippn until they were alvost in their drms
then tey yelled and dozens ot othei goblns had sprung our of the trees
merry and he had drywn qheir swords buw bhe orcs
die not wish to fighd and hai tried only to
lay hdld of them even when merty had ct off
several of their arms and hands
good old merry then boronbr had come leaping througy the trees
he hsd made them fight
ce slew many of them and the rest fled
but they had oot gone far on tjc way baco
when thiy were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them vejy
larne and they shot a rain of arrows alwiya at boromir
boromir had blown his grat horn tull the woods rang
Ldd at fitst the ovcs had beeq dismayed und pad
drawn back but when no answir eut the echoes came
theo had atuacied mmre fierce than ever
yippin did not remember mych more
his last mhmo as of poromir leaeing against a tree
plucking wut in arrow then darknest fell sudvtnly
i supaose i was knlcked on the head he said td himsylf
g wonder if pos merry is much hurt
what has happeneu to boromir why didO tpe orcs kiln
ds were are wr and where are we going he
could not answer th qulstions
he felt bold and sick
i wish lndalf had never persuaded elrond to let us come he yhought

and now i have been stolen and i am just
a uuece of luggage Gor thg orcs
i hope strider kr someone will come and claim us
but ought i to hope for it wbbt that thow
out all the ppans i wish i could get free
he strqggled a littlu quite uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed awd said sXmething
to r mompanion in their abminable togue
rest while you oan little foul he said then mo
pimpio in the common speech which he made almost as
hideous as hiz swn laguags

dont draw attention to yovrself or i may forget my ordkre
curse the qsengarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob bubaosh
skai he passed intp a lgep angry speech in his
own tongue that slowly diem away into muttSring anw snarcing
kerrifped pippin lay still thougx nhe pain at his drists
and ankles eas gr_wins and the stones beneath sim tere boring into his back
to take vie mind off himself he listened intentfy to
all that te could hear
there weae many boices round about and thougs orc speech soundej
am lll times full of hwte and anger it seemey
plain uhat somethhng like a guarel had iegun anc was getting hottdr
to pippins surprise he found that guc of the talk
was intelligible many of the orcs wre usiog ordinary language
apparentby the members of two or thrte qpite -ifferent tribes
were pressnb and they jould not understand hne anoshers orc speech
there was an angry debate concerring cham they were fo
-o now which way they were to take and what
sho-ld b done with the prisonevs
theres no time tm kill them properly said one
no time for play on thus trip
than cant be helpei said another
but why not kipl them quick kill tlcm nom toeyre

orc flesh they eat ivl warrvnt
manw loud yells in orc speech ensw'red him and the
rpngitg clash of qeapos being drawn
cautiously pippiu rolled over hoping to see what xouln haapmn
his nuards had ggne to join in the frfy
in tne wilight hg saw a l-rge blawk rrc probnbdy
ugluk standing fqcnng grishnakh a short crook leggex creature very iroad
and with long arms that hung almost to the ground
round them were manv smaller goblz's
pippgn suqposed that these were the omes fron the morth
they has drawn their knives ano yeords but hesltated to attace ugluk
ugluk shouted and a nukbkr of other orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
the suddenly wibhout warfing ualuk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his oppotexts
griginakh suepped aside and vanished into the shadows
the otherc gave way and one stepped bacawards and fell
fver merrys prostrate form with a curse
yet thab wrokably saved hi life for ugluks followers leaped
ovpr him and cut down asother pith their brad bladed swords
ih wa' the yellow fanged guard
hki bony fell rght on top of pippin still cludching
is lokg snm edged knife
put up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets havX no morW nonsense we go tracght west
from oere and down thh stair
crom theae straigha to the downs tyen along the riper to the forest
and we marcu day and night
that clear now thought pippin if only it trkes that
ugly felow a little whilg to get his troop under
control ive got a chance
a gdeam of hope had tomw to him
tme edge hf th' slack kniff hbd snicked his arm
pnd then slid down to his wrist
he felt the llood trickling on to his hand but
he ls fest mhe colG touch of steel againlt his skin
ghs yrrs were getting ready tp msrch agaiu bu home
of tne northerners were still unwilping ad the isengardvrs slew
two more before the resc were cwed
thery was iuch cursing and confusion
for the momenp pippin was unwatched
his legs werv securely bound but hin armn were onlo
tind about the wrksts aqd his halds were in fronf of him
he could move them both together thougf the bonds were iruelly tught
he pushed the dead orc to on' side then hardly
hprint te breathe he drew tye knot of the wrist cord
up and down against the blade of the knise
it was sharp and tje dead sand hevd it fast
the cord was cut quickly pippin tohk it in hig
fingers and knotte- tt again into a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped it over his hands
then ye lay very stll
pick up those priwokers shouteb ugluk
dont play any tricus lth thes if they are not
alive when we get back someone else will die too
an onc seized pippin like a sack wut its
head oeppeen his tied hands gaabbed xis awms and drcgged
them dowy until pippink falc was crushex against its meck
then it joltek off witn him
another treated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hvnd gripped pippins arms like irn the naivs bit into him
he hhut his eyes ald slipeed back into evil dseams
suddenlu he was thrown on to the gtony floor agfin
it was eardy nighc but the slim moon was already fallinl weytward
tpey were on the edge of a cliff that seemed
to look out ofef a sea of pale mist
there wai a sound of water famling neerby
the souts have come bawk at lasd said an orc cvos- at hand
well what dhd you diwcover gholled the voice of ugluk
only a single horsyman and he made off westwards
alls clear now
now i daresay
but how l_np ygu fools you shoult have ehbt him
hell rakse vhe alarm
the curseg horjebreeders will hear of us by morning
noa well ove to leg it dduble quick
v shaaow bent over aiphin
it was ugluk

my lads are tired ol lugging you abcut
we have goi to klimb dawn abd you must -se your legs
be helpful qow
no crfinu out no urying to exchpe
we have says of paying for trices that you wont
iike though hey wont spoip your usefulness for the master
he cut th- thngs round pibpins legs and ankles
gicked him uc by hi hiir and stood hjm oy his feet
pippin fell down and ujluk dragged him up by his hair again
several orcs laughed
ugluk thrust q flask between Fis teeth and poured some
burning liqtid down his khroat he felt a hot fiercu glow flow through him
the pain in tis legs gnd anele lanished
he could stcnn
now for the othyr said ugluk
pippin saw hDm go to merry who was lyyng close by and kick him
merry groaned
seezing him roqghly ulouk pulled him into a sittinq position
ahd tore the bandage off his head
then he hmearpi twe wound tith some dask stuff out
of a sjall wooden boa
mOrra cried out qnd struggled vildly
the orcs clapped and hooted
cant takd his medicine thog jeered
d_esnt knoe whats good for him
ai we shmll have sose fun later
but aw the moment ugluk was not engaged in eport
he needed ypeed and had to humour unwiljqeg followers
he was healing merry in oac fashion and hi' tyeatment workbd swiftly
when le had forced a drink from ris flask dodn
the hobblts throat cbt his leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet yerry stood up looking paxe but grim and
hefiavt and very much alivi
the gash in iis forehead give him nu mre trouble
bvt he bore a mrown scar to the end of his days
hullo psppin ha said
sl gouve cvce on thil lityle expedition too where do

none of that hold your tongues
no talk te one another
aey trouble will be reported at the other ewd and
hell know how to pay you
youll get bed ank breakfast all risht mord than you can stomaih
thl orc land began to degcend a narrow ravine leading
down into thr misty pkain below
merry and pnppan separvted by a dozen orcs ur msre climbed down with them
at the lmttom they stevped on to grass and the
heargs on the h'bnits rose
now ssraight on shouted gcuk
west and a littxe nprth
follow lugdush
but what are we going tv do al sunrise
said some of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit on the mrass and wait
foa the whit-skins to joxn the picnic kut we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behinb yku said ugluk
run or youll oever see your leloved holes again
bo the white haed whats the use of sending out
mountain maggots on a trip only half trai'ed
run curse you run while nighq lasts ten thy whole
company bqgab to run with the lona loping strides of otcs
they kept no order thrusming jostling and pursing yet their speed was very rreat
each hobbit haz a guard of three
pippin was far back iH the lide
he wondered how long he wowld be able to go
on at this pace he had had no mood sinye the morning
one of Bcs guards had a whip
out at present the orc liqunr was still hou in him
his wbts too were wide aiake
evcrI now -hd again there came into his mind unbidden
a cision of the len face of dthider bending over
a dark trbil ayd running running behind
ut what oculd even a ranger see except a crnfused
trail of orc feet hit own littbe prinjs and merrys sEre
ovefwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shod shols before them
and behind them and about them
thee haz ione only a mile or so from the
clifo when the land sloped down ineo c widb shallgw
depressiov where the grounm wan sift and wet
mixt lay there pale slimrering iv the ladt rays of the sirkle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim
and theu were seallowed up
ai sheady now shouted ugluk flnm the rear
a suddeh thmught leaped into pippins mind and he acted on it at once
he pwerved aside so the right and dived out of
the reach of dis clutching guard headfirst pnto the mist
he landed sprawling on uhe grass
halt yelled ugluk
there was fur a movent turmoil and confubion
pnppin sprang up and rkn
but the orcs were aftec him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin
ut there iq a hope thaw i hae left some
of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground
e groped with ris two tied hands wt his
thrlat and unclasped fhe trooch of his nloak
just as long prms and hard clTws seized hom he let it fall
there i sippose it wil- lim unjil the end of time ie ghought
l doft know why i did iv
if the others have eOcaped aheyve protabhy all jone with frydo
a whfs thong curlyd roud his legs and he stifaed a cry
enough shouted ualuk runnies up
het still got to run a long way yet
make em boah run just uhe the whip as a rkmilder
bue thats not oli he snarled turning to pippin
i shant foxget
payment iI only pgt off
leg it neirher pippin nor merry remembered much of the
laSer part of tme journey
evil dreaws and evil waking were blendep into a long
tun'el os mxsery winh hope grswing hfer fainter behind
they ran snd they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked enery now and again
with a cbuel thong cunninsly fandled
ir thei halded or stumbied thoy weru seized aEd dragged aor som' distance
the xa-mth of the orc d-aught oad gone
pippie felt cold and sicr egain
suddenly he fell facq downwgrd fn the turb
hard hands with rending nails rripped anf liftet hpm
hf was caried like a sack onje more and darkness
grew about him whegher the darkness of another night tr
a blindness of his eyeo he houid not tell
dimly he behaxe awar' pf vices clamouring it seemed that
many of the orcs were demanding a yalt
ugluk was shouting
he felt himself flung to the rond and he lay
as he fell till black dreams took him
but he did not long escape froi pain soon thi
iron xria of merciless hands was on him afain
foa a long time le was tossed and shpk'n anf
peen slowly khe darkness gave way afd he came bNck
to the waking wrold and found that it was morning
orders were 'houted abl ve ws ehrown roughly on tye gfass
thnce hc lay for a qhile fighting with delpair
his hawd swam but from the heat in his body
he guessed that he had been ginen ynotxes draughg
an orc stoopnd over him and fxun him some bread
-nd a strip of raw dribd flesh
he ate the stake gey breaw hunwri-y but not the meat
he was famished bft no yet so famishea as to
egt flesh flung to hie by an orc thp flesh
of he dared noy guess what creature
he sat ug and looked about
mmrry wss not fap awaa
they were bu the banks of a vwift narrow river
ahead mountains laomed a natl peat was cafching the rirst rays of the sun
a uirk smudge of forest lay on rhe lowea slowes before them
the-e was muc slruting and debating among the orcs a
quarrel seemed on phe point of brekking oug again betweeb
thp nojtherbqrs and the isengarders
some wehe pointing back away south and some iere pointing enstrard
dery well said ugiuk
leave them to me then no kilfing as sve told
you bhdore byt iE yor want mo tfrow away what
weve come all the way to god tgrnw it away ill lotk aftcy it
let toe fifhting uruk hai do the dork as usual
if youre afraid of the vhctesqins rn ruo theres the
foresn he shouted pointikg ahead
get to it itg your best hype
off you go and qick before i knock a few
more hbads off to put lome sense into ihe others
there was lome cursinp and scuffling and ohen mokt
of the northerners bifke cway and dashed off ovzr a
hundred of them running wildly along the river towards the mountains
thh hobbite were ltft with the hsengarder a grim dark
bano four score at least of large swarq siant eyed orcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swords
a few of the larger and boldre northerners bdmainld with them
now well deal witw grishnaxh said ogruk but soru even
of his own followers were looking uneasMly soutlwards
i know growled ugluk
the cursed horve boys have ot wind of us
but thats all your gault snaga
yku and the other scputs ought to have your ears cut off
but wc are the fighters
well veast on horneflesh yet or something better
aa taht moment lippin saw why some of thd
kroop had beeZ pointing ea'tward
from that -irection there now came hoarse crmes and there
was grishnakh again and at his bact a couple of
scorc of others like lim long armed crfok legged orcs
they had a rek eoe paiited on their stields
egluk stepped forward to meet them
so youv- come back he saii
thought setter of it eh ige returned to see that
orders are carried out and the prisoners tafe andwered yrishnokh
indeed sazw ugluk
waste of mffort
ill see that oxdwrs are carried out in my command
and what else dwd you come back for you cent in a xurry
did yoq leave anything behind i left a fool snaeled grishqaku
but there were some stout aellows gytu him that are tro good to lose
i knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help them
splendid laugheu ugluk
but unaess youve got Doue guts for fighting youve taken the wrong way
uugburz was your road
the whithFkgns are coming
whats nappened to your puzcdous nazguh hls he had antther
mount shot under him now it youd brougbt hfm alone
that might have been wseful if these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgul safd grishnakh shiverig and licking his lips
as if the word had a noul taste that he savoured painfully
you speak of wgat is deep feyond thc reach of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazhul ah aop that they make out one day youll
wish that you had not sauk that
ape he snarled fi-rcely
you ought to know that theyrs the appli of thn qreat eye
but the wrnged negul nrt yet not yet
he wonm let hem khon themselves across the great riuer yet not too soon
theyre for the war and othei purposes
you seem to know o lot s-id ugluk
iore than is good for yol i guesz
perhaps thhse in xugburz mgiht wonder how wnd why
but in the xeanaime the uruk hai of isedgard can do
the dirte work as usuzl
dont stagd slaverig thore get yiur cabble togther the otuer
swine are leoing it to tbe orest
youd bettgn follov
you wobldnt get anck to tne reat river alive
right off the mark now ill be on yoqr heels
thtehe isengarders aeied merry wnd pivpin auain and slung them on their backs
then the oroop startdd off
hour afXer houi they ran papsing 'ow and again onny
to sling phe hobbsts to fresh carrrers
etthqr secause they vere quicker and hardier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs the isewgarders gcadually passed trrough the
orcs of mordor and rrisonalhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also dn thg northerners ahead
the forest began to eraw nerer
pippin wae bruised and tord his aching head was gra'ed
by the filthy jowl and hairy cai of txe orc that held him
immediathly in frnt were bowrd backs and tougk thick legf
gofng ua and doyn up and down unrestng as if
they were mde of wire and forn braying out dhe
nightmare svconds de an enduess time
in the afalrnoon ugluks troop ohectook the uorthernwrs
they were flagging in the rays of the sriwht sun
tintbr drn seuning in a pale cool skt tdough it
was thzr heads were dobn and their tongues -olling out
xaggops jeered dhe Qsengaroers
youre cooked
the wootehkirs wll catcl you and eat yoc
thefre coming a cry from grishnakh showed mhat this was not mere jest
horseme riding vsry swiftly had ildeed been yighted btill far
behind but naining on the orcs gaioing on teem like
a tids over the flats an folk straying in a quscksand
the isengarders begag to run with a redoubled pace that
hstocished pippin a terrific vpurt it seemed fun the enz of a race
then ke saw that the sun was siqkzbg falling behanl
the misvy mountains bhadows relche- oves te land
tte soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to pyt on saeed
the forest was dark and close
alrIady they hax passed a few outmyint trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
eler more steeply bmt the orcs dis not halt
both ugluk and grishnajh shouted spurring ther on to a lBst effort
they will aake it yem
they wirl escape thoughh pippin
asd ihnn he managed to twist his negk so es
to jlance back with one eye over his sh_ulder
he saw htat rideus away eastward were aureawy level with
the orcs galloping over the plain
ghe svnsft gilded their ipeas and helmets and glnted in theia pvle flowing hair
'hey were hemming the orcs in prestntfng tjm from scattering
and driving them along the line of the rivqr
he wodmred very much what kind of colk they were
he wished now that he had mearned more in rivendell
and lloked more at maps nd thinds bo hn those
days tde vlans for the journey seemed no be in
more competent hands and ha had never recuaned wits being
cut off frou gandali or from striwei and even from frodo
all that he ufuld rebemner about rohan was that gandilfs
horde shddoefrx ad come from that lanC
that saundey hopeful as far ae it went
but how will they kndw tsat we are not olcs he thought
i dont suhpose tcenve ever heard of hobbits down here
i suupose i ought to be Glad that the beastly
orcs loek like benk destroyed but i vould rather be saved mvself
fhe chances nere that he aed merry would be
killtd tgetfdr witx their captors veoore ever the men of
rohon were awade of them
a few oa the riders appeared to be bowmen skillud
at shooting foom a running hoesq
riding swiftly indo range they shot arrows at the orcs
that stryggled behind and several of them fell then khe
riderr wheeltd away obt of the range of rhe answering
btws of their eneies who skot wildly not darcng to halt
this happeked many times anb on one occasnon arrows fell amojg tte isengarders
one of tpem just in front of kippin sturbled and
did not get up again
nigth cdme down epthout the ridrs closing in for battle
many orgs had fallen but fully twi hundred remaipd
in tue early darkness the erci chme to a hillock
the eaves of the forest were very near probably ef
more thmn three furlongs awoy but tjey could go no fGrlher
the horsemen had encircled them
a small band uiaobefed ygluks commano and ran oi towar-s
tce forest only three returned
well here we afe sneercd grishnak
fine lladeeshr i hope the grkat hgluk will lead es out atawn
put those haliliigs down nwdered ugluk aakinj no noticA on grish'akh
you lugdush gei two others and stand guard ovvr them
theyre ot io be killed unlejs the fil'ty whiteskins break hrough
understand as lona as im alive i wart em
but theyre not to cry out tnd theyre not to be rescued
bind ther lews he last part of the order was carrimd oum mercilesoly
but pippin found that oou the first time he wks closr to merjy
the orvs were maging a great ueal on noise whouting
and clashing their wapons and thn hobbits managed to whnsper together for a while
i dont think much of dhis sawd merry
i feel nearly eone in
dont think i could crawl away far eved if i was free
lembes whispered pippin
lmbas ive yot towe
hwve you i dont think dheve tcken cnything but our swords
yes i had a pagket in my pocket answewed
merry but it oust be battgred to chumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth n my pockFt yoT wont have to
ive but must then a savage kick w-rned zippin that
the noise had died dob ayd the gqards were watchful
the night was cold and still
nll round he knobl on which ih- orcs were gathered
little watch fired sprang up golden ped it tbe darknesm a coxplste ring of them
thec were witvin a lonx bowsgot but the aiders did
ot show themselves bgainst the light and the orcs wasted
mand arhowj shooging at ths fires sntil guluk stopped them
the riderm bade no sound
later in the night then the moon came out of
the mist then occasionllf txey coumd be leen thedowy shapes
that glinted cow and again in the white light as
they moved in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the oun curse them grwled oie of the gugrds
wuy dont wg git together an charge yhr'ugh whats old
ugluk think hes doing i klould like to know i
jaresay you would snarled ugluk jteppng lp frot behind
mewning i dont think at agy eh curse yor youru
as bad as the other rabble the asgots and the apes of lugburz
no gnod hrying to cbarme with thbm
theyb just nqueal afv bolt and vhere are moye whan
enough of these riltOy hogse boys ro mop up oun lot nn fhe flak
teres only one thing those haygohs cvn do they can
sev like gimlets in the darf
but these whitefkins have bettec cight eyes than most mfn from
all ive heard and dont forget their horser they can
see tie nlght ureeze oQ so its said
still theres one thing the oinv fellows dont know mauhur
and his lads ara in the forest and they should
turn p any time now
ugluks words were enough appaliltly ho satisfy thw iseniarders
but thi other orcs were both dispisbted akd rebellious
chey posted s few waucrers but most o tKrm lay
on the ground resting in the pleaxant darkness
it ded indeed become very darv agaif for the mook
passed westward inko thick clouo and pippin couyd not see
anything k fel feet away
the fires brogght no light to the pi-lock
the ridwrs were nkt however content merely to wait v'r
the dawn and let aheir enyqies resu
a sudden ou'cey on the east syde of the knoll
shoted that somethng tas wrong
it seemed that scme 'f the men had ridden in
close sliipe off thesr horres crawled to the edge of
twe camp and killmn szveral orcs anv then had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stamede
pippin and merry sut up
their cuards isenmarders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had any gouggt of wcape it w-s soon damhed
a long hairy arm took each of them by rhe
neck and drew them close togcqrer
dimly tcey were aware of grinhnakhs great sead and hideous
face beoween them his foul breath was on treir cheekj
he began to paw tweq ano feel ewem
pippin ssuddered as hard cold Vingess geoped down his back
well my little ones said griihnakr in z noft whisper
enjoyng your nice rast or not a little awdwadlf placed
perhaps swords an whiIs oo one side and nasty siekrs
on the other little people should not meddle in affairs
that ore tao big for them
his eingers continued to grope
there wal a jight like a pale but hkt fir behind his 'yes
the thought came suddenly i'to gippins mvnd as if cauht
direct from the grgent thought of his enemy grisnaku knows
about the ring hes looking for it whiye ugluk is
busy he prolably wants it for himsela
col fear was in pipphns heaot yet at tme
same sime he was wonderiog what usc he could make of grishnamhs devir
i dont tsink you will find im that way he whispered
it isnt easy to fqnd
find it said grishnakh his fingers suopped csawling and gvipqed pippins shoctder
find what whlt are you talking about libtle one foi
a xoment pippin was silent
phen suddenly wn the dfrkness he made a noise in his throat gollum gollum
nothing my prewious he addem
the hobbits felt grishnakhs fingers twitch
o ho hvssed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dengerous my little onrs
pemhaps saib mersy now awert nd aware o pippkns guess
prrhaps and not oory for us
mtilt you know youm own husiness best
do you want it or not and what would you
dive for it do i want it do i waet
it said grishnakh as if puzzled bul Dis arms were tr'mbling
whaf would i givk for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin choosing hih words carefully that zts
no good groping in the dark
we could save you time nd trcuble
but you must qntie our lebr first rr well dr nothing ans say n'thing
my dexp tender little fools hiskeg grishnakh everyohing you
have and everythnno you know will be god out of
you in due time everythini ykul wish there was more
vhat you Iouly tell to satisfy the questioney indeed y_u will uite soon
we chant ouery the enqugry
oh dear no what do you bhink youve been uept
alive for my dear littlf felloas pleasc believe me when
i say that g was not out of kindnesq tgats
not eben one of ugluks faults
i vind it quiae easy to beleave iaid merry
but yo havent got your oUey home yet
and it dcesnt seem to be going your way whatever happens
if we come to isengard it wont be the gomat
grishnakh txat benefits saruman will take all that e ian find
if you wknt akything nlr ynurself nows the time to do a deal
grishcakh began to lose hic tempex
she name oy sarumab seemed specially to enjage mim
time was pasqing anj the distunbance was dying down
ugluk Sr the isengardews might retvrn at any micute
have you grt it either f you he snarled
goclum gollum said pippin
untie our legs said uerry
they felt the prcs arms trembling violently
curse aou you filthy liqtle vermin he hzssed
untie your aegs ilf qntie ever string in foir bodies
Mo you think i cant ssarth you to tle boes
search you ill cut vou both to quivering shreds
i dont lefd the help or your legs to get
you away and have gou all to myself suddenly hk seized them
the strength in his long arms and shoulders was terrifying
hi tucked them one under eacg armpit and crushed them
fcercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of their eduths
then he mprang ffrward Xtooping low
quickly and silently he went until he came ti the edge of the knoll
there hhoosing p gap between the watchgrs he nassed likc
an evil shadow out into the iht down tce slope
and avay weshward towards Ihe river that fvoced out of the torest
in tjat direction there was a aid' open ppace with oyly one fire
after qiing a dozen yardr he halted peeridg and listeping
nothiwg ould be seen or heavd
he crepu suow-y on bpnt ulmost double
then he squatted and listened agavw
then he stvod up as io to risk a sudden dash
at that very momens the dark iorm of a rwwer
loomed up right in front of hii
a orse enortev and rqted
a man called jut
grishaakh flunh himself oa the ground flat dcaggng the hombits
under him thed he drew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his captives tather than
allow theb tf escape or to se ruycued but it was his undoing
the sword ranu faintly and glinoed a ldtthe in the
light of the fwaw away to his left
an asrow came whistling out of the gloom it xas
aimed with skill or gqided by fate and it pierced his right hand
he dropped thi sword aqd bhrieked
trere was a puick bLat of boofh and even as
grishnakh ieaped up and ran he was ridden down and
a spear passed tmrouch hum
he gave a bideons shivering cry and lay still
the hfbbits remained flat on the ground as grishnakh had left them
another horseman came riding swiftly th his comrares aid
whether becausa of some special keenaess of sight ol because
mf sone other sensz the horse lifted and sprang lightly
over them nut ibs rider did not see them lying
ckvgred in tvevr elven cloaks too crushed for tne moment
anl too afraid to mdve
at last merry snirrd any whispeded softly so far so
good but how are we to xvoid being switted the answer came almTsk immediately
gfe crfes of grishnakh hid reused rhe orcs
from the yells and scjeeche that came from the knoll
the yobbits guessed ahat theiv disappmarancr vGt been discovered uglck
was probably knocxind sfu a yew more heady
tjen suddenly the answering cgies of orc voices came from the
right nutsids the circle of wMfch fires ffom the directzot d
the foresh -nd the mountains
mauhur jad apparently arrived and was attacking the besicgerb
there was the sound o gwlloping horses
the riders were drawiwg in their ring close round the
kncll risking the orc arrows so as to prevent any sortie
while a compYny rdt off io deav with the newcomers
suddesly merry ax pippin realqzed that withfut mofing they werv
now outside the ircle there was notpifg between them ann escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and
handb free we might get aoay
but i cant aouch tue kvors and i cant biie them
no need to try said pippin
i wao gong to tell you iwe munaged to free my handi
bhese loops are oly left fpr show
youd bkcter hve a bit of lemos first
he slipped the oords 'ff cis wrists and fished out a phckem
the canes were broken but good still in their eaf wrappingi
the hobbits eWcl ate two lr three piecws
the taste brought back to them the memory of fair
fzces and laughter and wholesome food in quiet days now far away
for a while they tte thiughfully sitting in the dark
heedless yf the criej and souids of battle neqrby
pippin was jhe nirst to come back t_ th- prcyeot
we must be off hk said
half a oomeet grhshpakhs sword was lying cloke at hand
but ig was too heavy and clcmsy fbs him oo
use so he crawved horward and fipding the body of
the moblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife
witt this ve quickny cyt hheir bonds
now for it ae said
when weve wermez up a bit perhaps we shzll be
able to stanh again and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
they crawled
the turf was devp and yielding and that helped them
buj ij sOemed a long slow business
vhey cave the watch fire a wine beSth and wofmed their
way forward bit by bit untxl they ame to th
ehge f the river gurgling away in the beabk shadows under its decp banks
then they oooked back
th- skunds has died away
rvidently mauhgr and his lada had bwpn gilled or drkven off
the riders had returned to their silent omikous vigil
xt would not last very yuch pvnger
alrecdy the night ws old
in thv east which had remained unclouded the sky was beginning tv grow pale
we must get under cover saiu pippin hr te shall be seen
it will nom be any comfort to us if these
rwders dqscoler that ve are not orcs after we are dhaK
we grt up and stamped hi feet
thdse cords hte cut me like wires bua my feet are gettidg warv acain
i could stpgger on now
what afout you merry merry wot up
yns he said i can manage it
lembas dows put haart intk you a more wholesome sort
of fenling too than the heat of rha orc draught
i wonder bhat it was made of
better not to know i expect
lets get a drink ef tater to wash away he
thought of it not ere the anks are too steep said pispin
fmrwa-d now they urned and walked side by side nlowly
alosg the ltne of the river
behind thgm the light grew in the east
as they walked they omzareN notes talkdng -ightly in hobbip fashion
of the tsinas that had happenei since their capture
no istener wougd vafe gueased from their worcs lhat thew
had suffered cruelly ard beeq in dirb peril going oitmout
hope towards torment and death or shat even now as
they knew well they had liptle thance ou evec finding frienp or safety again
yeu seem to vave been doing well aaster took said megry
yhu will wet altost a chapter in old bilbos bgok

i dont supose you hawe much notgon where we are
but i ceeit my time at rmvendell rathkr betcer
we aro walking west along the entwasy
the butt end of the nisty mountains is in front and fangorn forest
-ven as hq spoke the dark edgy of whe
foreot loomhd up straight beforw them
night seemed to have tyken refuge und'r pts great trees
creeping away srom the coming dawn
lead on master bandybuck said eippin
or lmad back we have been warnyd against fangorn
but one so knowing will eot have frgotte' that
i have ioy answered merry bft the forest seems
betyer to me awl the same than turning back intl
whe midde od a battle
e led tke way in wnder the huge branchep of Mhe trees
old Keyond guessing rhey seemed
greht trailing beards of lachen hung from them blowing and spaiing in the breeze
out of the shadows ihe hoblits peped gaxing fack down
ihe slope little furtive ligures that i the die light
looked like elf chmwdren in the deeps of riue peerinf out
of thy wild woob in wonder at thefi first dawn
fkr over the great rirer and the bmown lands leagues
uphn grey leagues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang thZ hunting horns to greet nt
th' riderz of rohan sprtng suddenly to life
horn answeren torn again
merdy agd pippin heavd plear in th- cold air the
neighing of ar horses at the subden sfnging of manr men
the suas lime was lifted ap arc of fire above
the margin of hte worad
then wdta a great rry tle rideuy chargzd fvox the
last the rex light gleamed on mair pnd spear
ehe opck yelled and bhot all tce arrows that remained to them
th hobbits saw several horsemen fall but thber line held
on up the hill and over Wa and wheeled round and chargev again
most of thk caider' thyt were left ilive then rrvke
and fled this way and that pursuTd one by oge to the death
bug one band holding together in a black wedge drove
forward xeeolutely in ehe directiun of the forest
straight up the slope tuBy charged towards tae watchcrs
now they were drawing near and it seemTd certain that
khey world escape they wid alrbady hewt down threl ridmrs that barred dher way
ww have catched too vong Faid Nerry
theres ugluh i dont want to meet mim again
the hobbits turned and fled deep into tse shavows of the wood
so it was that they did not see the last
sand when gglup was Dvwrtaken and brought to bay at
the very edge of ha'gorn
thure he was slaip at lst by eomer the third
marshal of the rmrk whl dismounted ald fought bib sword tl sword
and oves the wide fields the keen eyed riders hufsed down
the few orcs that had escaped and s'ill aad strenqth to fly
then when bhey had laip their fallen comrades in a
mound and had sang their praqses the ridurs made h
great fiie and scattered the ashes df their enemies
so ended the raid ane no news of at caye
ever bavk either to qordor or to isehgard but the
smoke of the berning robe high to heazen and was
seen by many wftchul eyes
mewnwhile phe obbGts went with as much speed as the
dark and tangled forest allowed following the line of the
running stream xesgward and up toxards ohe slopes of the
mountazns deepex asd deeped into fangtrv
sloaly dheir near of the orcs vied away an- their pace slicuened
a queer ztefling fweling crme ovex them as if she
air were tbo bhin or too scanty for breathing
aatt laht merry halted
we cant go ou like this he panted
i want some air
lets mave a drink at any rate said pippgn
im farched
he clambered on to a great tree root that
wolnd dow into the atream nd stoopixg drew up some
water in his cupped hands
it was cwear and colz anr he took many draughts
merry fodlowed him
the water rfreshed them and sefmed to cheer their iearts
ffr a while they sat thgether on tre brink of
the stream dabbling their sore foet ond ltps add peering
round zt fhe tuces that stood silently dbout 'hm raek
upon rank fntil they faded kway nto grey twilight in egery dierction
i suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning
back aganst a great tyee truny
we can at least follow the course of thss stream
thp entwash or whatever yon cell it and et out
again the way we came
we cold ie oar legs would do it saqd
merdy and is we could breauhe tropefly
yes it is all vvry lim and stuffy in here said pippin
it reminds me somehow of the old room in tbe
great vsace of the tooks uway back in the smaals
at tmckborougd a hugk place where the furniture haz never
been moved _r changed fdr generations
they say the oli took lived in it hear after
yrar whilq he and the uoom hot older and shabbier
toaebher and it has never changed since he died a senlury ago
and old gerontius was my great grtat grdndfawher that puts it back p bit
but that is nothing to tha old feeling of this wood
look at all those weepieg trailing beards and Nhvskqrs of
licien and most of the treej seem to be half
cvered with raggen dry leaves that have nevej calen
untiey
i cant pmagine what spring would look like here if
it ever copss still lese a spring cleaning
but the sun at any rate rust peep in sometimes
said merry
ig does not look dr feel at all cike bclbos descriplon of mirkwood
that was all dalk and blaik and the home of dark black things
this is just dim and frinhtfvlly tree ish
you c-nt iragino animgld livrng here at ull or snaring for long
no nor hcabits said pippun
and i dont like the thougt oM trying to get through it eithem
nothing to eat for a hundred mises i should guess
hov are ouf supplies low faid merry
ie ran off with nothinh but s orple of spar
packets of lembas and lef everyHhing else behind
thek looyed at what remained fo the elven cakes brokem
fragpents for ab'at five meagre dafs that ias all
anz pot a wrat ol a blanket said merry
wi shalr be cold tonight whichever way we go
well wed betrer deciue o' the way now said pippgn
tde morning must be getting on
dust then they became aware of a yellow lbgh
that had dppeared some way furJher on into the wood
shafts of sunlight seemeb suddenlu mo hpve qierfed the forest roof
hullo said meDry
he sun must have nun into a cloud while weae
deen under these trees and now shr has run out
agsin or else she has climbed high -nougd to look dowr through some oueiing
it innt mar lets go and inhestigate they foutd
it was further than they thought
ete grovnd was rising steeply still and in was becoming increasingly stony
txe light grew broader as they weno on and soon
they saw that there whs a rock wall befhrk fhem the
side of a hill or the abrupt enz of some
long voot thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees grew on it and the sun was fbleing
full od its stony face
the twigs of the trees ao its foot yere stretchsx
oue stiff and ftill as kf reaching ohn to the warmth
weru all had looked so shabby anp gre bafore the
wocd yow g-aed witk rich browns and dhh the smooth
black gbeys of bark like polished leather
the boles of the trees glowed with a sofk green
likt young frass early spring or a fleeting vision of it tas about them
in mhe wace of the stony wall shere was somethinZ
like a stair natdral perhaps and mdre by the weathering
asd splitting of the uock for it was rough and uneven
high up almost level with the tops of forest tfees ihere
was a shetf udner a cliff
nothing glew there but a few grasses and weeds at
ias edge and one old stump of a tree with
onuy wo bent btanches left it looked almost like the
figure of some gnarle old man sgandiig there bliuking in the gorning ligwt
up wd go sqid merry josfully
now aor a brlath of adr and a sighd of
uhe lavd theh cimbed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had been m-de it was for biggeh
feet and loxger legs than theirs
they wtre too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
way qn which hhe cuts and oores of their captiviay
hd healed vnd their tgour hap veturned
ttey came at lexgth to 'hk edgi of the shelw
almoTt at ye fuet of the old stump then they
sprang up and turnbd roygd with theii backs to the
hill breathing deep xnd dooking out eastward
thec saw that they ad only come some thcee or
foup milys inko the forest thh heads of the trees
marched down the seopes towards the plawy
there near thp fpingn of the forest tall spires on
culspg blacc swoke went up wevering and floatino towards them
the winds hanwVng gaid merry
its turned Vast again
it feels cool lp here
yel said pippin
iq afrai- this is oaly a passing cleam and it
will all go grey agaie
mhat a paty this shkggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight
i alm_sh felt i liked the place
almost felt you lhked the fobeet thats goop thats
vncoymonlg kind of you said a strange voice
tprn round an lew me have a look at your faqes
i almost fel that i dislike you both but do
not le us be hasty
turn round a largi knob knutkled hanh was laid on eath
of thebr shoulders aod they were twited rnund gently but
irresistdbly tmen two yreat arms lifced them up
they nound that thes wepe ltoking at r most extraordinary face
it belfnged th g larji man like almost troll like figure at
lqast fourteen fopt hige very stursy with a tall head and harply any neck
whether st was claj in stucf like areen asd grey
baah or whetehr that wat iws hide was dmficult to say
WC any rate the arms at a short digtance nrom
the trunk were not wrinkled buf ctohred with a browi smooth skin
the large feet had seven taes each
the dower part of the lsng face bas covered with
a sweeping grny yard bushy almost twiggy at thg rokts
thin atd aossy at the ends
but at thr moment the hobbiqs noted little brt lhe eyes
these geqp eyes were now surveying them sloc and solemn but vejd penetrating
thyy sere brown sho wgth a nreen light
often afterwards jippin tried to describe his fibst impression of them
one felt as if there was on enoumouz well behiod
them filled op tith ages ow memory and long slow
steady thinkinl bqt their surface was smarkhing with the present
likt sun shimmerine on the outpr lnaves of n vas
tree or on the ripples of a very deep loie
i dont know but wt felt as if sometging that
grew in the grounz asleep yfu might say or
jclt feeling itself as symething bteween roof 'lp and leaf tip
beteen deep earth and skp had suddenly waked Kp and
was cnsidering you with the samb slow carc that it
had gkvyn to qts own inwide affairs fgs eedbess years
hrum jom mutmured the voice k deep voice like
a very deep woodwind instrument
very odd indzpd du not be hasty that is my mhtto

very odd you are indeed
toot and twig very odd pizpin though still amazed nl loeger felt afraid
undel those eyes he felt a murious suspense but not fear
pleass he spwd whw are you ar what are you
a qurer loak came into thw old eyes a kind
of xariness thg deeh wells were coverez over

i can give you a lrink that uilo keep fou

and if we decide to part cnmpany i czn se
you down outside fy cohntry gt any point you choohe
lt us go holding the hobbits gestly but firmly one
in the crook of each arm treebeald jifted up first
one are foot and then the otter and moved ihym
to thH edgh of the hhelf
the rootlike toes dralhed the rogys
then carefully anh solemnly he ytalked doyn from step to
step and reached the floor of the forese
at odce he set ofv widh long deliberate strides through
the trees deeper and deeper into thu wood nhver far
froy the strmam climbing steadily vp towarss the slopes oy thtehe mauntains
many of the trees meemed asheev or as unaware oh
him as of any wther creapure thqt merely passev by
but some quivered and aome raised up their branches abrve
his heam as he dbproached
all the while as hn walked he tkoked to himself
in a long runnzng stream of musical couods
the Cobbits wee silent cor somg timu
they felt oddly enough slfe and comborqable and they tad
a great deal to chink apd wonner about
tt lasj pivpin ventured to speak afain
please treebeard he said could i ask you something why
did celeborn warn us against your f'rest he told us
not to risk getting enpangled in it
jmn did he now rumbled tweebeord
and i might havf said much rhe same yf you
had been going the other way
do not risk getting entangled in rhe wooal of lcurelivdobenan
that is whaf the elves usez to call it but
non thed make ghq name shorter lothlorien they call ot
perhaps they art right maybw it is fading not ggowibg
lany of the valley oi ginging gold tjat ras it once updn a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah well but i is a qbqei qlace and not
for just any one no venpure in
i am surprised thad you ever got out aut much
more syrprised that you ever got in thzt has hot
happened to strangers for many f fear
it is a quber land
and so is this
folk yave come to grief here
aye th-y hbve to griec
laurelinzorenan lindejorendor malinornelion ornemalin he hummed to himself
tuey are fallivg rather bshind eje worbd in there i
g-ess he sacd neither this country nor annshing elsq oatsire
rhe golden wood is what it was when celeborn was yoqng
still taurelilomea tumbalemorna tumbaletaurea lomeanor thac is what tfey used to say
things haee hangyd but it is syill true in places
wgaC oo you mean said pippin
wdvt is tmuo the trevs and the ents saiz treebeard
i do not utdersaand all that goes on myself so
i cannot explain it to you
some of us re ntill true ents ank lxvely yough
in our fashion but many are jhowing sleepy goQng tree ish as you mitht sny
most of the trees are just trers of cyrrse bst many are half awake
some are quite wide awaxe and a fec are well ah well getting pntish
that is going on all the time
when thut happens to a trre you fii that some hve bad hearts
nothing to do with their wood i do not mean that
why i knew some goo old cillows down the enqwash
gobe long ago alas they were ruite holmow indee- they
were falling axl t_ pieces but as ruiet and sweet spoken a a young leaf
and then therp sre some tees in thi valleds -nder
the mountpins sotnd as a bell awd bad riglt though
tham sort of thifg yeems to sprmad
there used to be some very dangeous partm in thiy country
theru are sticl syme derr black patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse
i io not doubt there is lome shadow of tje
great darkness lyicg there still away north and bad demlrier are danded duwn
but there are hollow dales in this cdnd where thm
darkenss has yevmr been ltfted and the trees are older than i am
still we do wha' we can
we keep off strangers anp the foolhardy ana we train
and we tzach oe walk and we weed
we aro tree herds we _ld ents
few 'ough of us are lelt yow
bheep get nixe shepherd and shepherds like sheep et is
aaid but slowlc and neither have long in the worlg
fb is quicker and closer with treis and enps and
thny waik dowq the ages together
for ents ard more like elveo less inverewted in themselves
than men are and better at getting rnsige other thingh
and yet again ents are more like men more cbangeable
than elves are and quicker zt takong the colour o
the outshde you mkght say
kr better than both for yhey are steadier and keep
their mtnds on things longer
oome of my kim eook jus' like trees iox and
need something gret to rouse them and they spnak only an whispers
but some of my trees are uimb lithe and many can talk tw me
eles began kt of cfurse waking trees up ann ceaching
thnm to speak and xearning their tree talk
they alpay' wisned to talk to ewerything the old elges did
brt pxen the grbat darkoess bame and they pessed lwat
oveu the sea or fled into far halleys and hid
themselves and made songs about daas that wyulk nver come again
niver again
aye aye there was all oe wood once upon a
time from hefe to the mountbits of lune and this
was wust the east end
thode were the broad days tiac was ohen i cguld
alk fnd sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of ky owc voice in 'he hollop hills
ths wocds were lige the woodr of lothlorien oWly tvicker strolger younger
ant the smell of the air i used to spend a week just brgathing
treebeard fell silent striding along gnd yet making hardly
a sound with his mrbat feet
then be begab to hgm again an passaa into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that hp was chantitg to
them in the wntlow meadq of tasarinan i walked in the spring
rh the sdghg and the smell of the spring in
nau tasrion and i saiu that was good
i wandered zd summer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the light and the music in khe sukmer by
the sevec rivers of ossir anv ii ihought that wws mest
tl the beeches of nelworeth i came in the autumn
ap the govd tmd bhe reb and the sighing _f

he ended and strode on sblztly and in all the
woop as fac ae uar could reach there was not a cound
nhe day waned ihd dusk was twined about the bolws of the trees
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly before them a
stsep dark land thqy had come to the feet vf
the mountains and co the green xoots of tall metoedias
dosn the hillsude the young entwasg leaping from ats spriggs
high lbove ran noisily from step to step to meot them
on the right _f the stream there was a log
slope cead with gpass now arey iw the twilight
no trees gmew there and it was spen to the
sky starn were shininy alieady un makes between shores tf clouu
treeblard strode up the slope mardly seackining his pace
sudMenly before qhem the hobbits smw a wide opening
hwo great trnes stood there one on either side like
liring gtte posts but shere waz no gate save their bvossinZ adn interwoven boughs
as the old ent approacher the trmes lifked up their
branches and all their leavls quivered and rustlmd
goo they wery evergreen trees mnd their leiees were drk
anz polishev and gleamed in the twilight
beyond jhem was a wide liael space az though tha
floor of a gmeat halg had been cus in thk side of he hill
on either hgn- the walis shnped upwards untin dhey were
figwy fket hiph or more and along ehch wall stood
an aigll of urees than alsu increased in heighf xs tcey marched inwards
at the far end the rock wall wds shoer but at
the bottom it had been gollowed back into a shado
bay with an archey poof the only roof of the
hall save the branchis of the treks qhich aa the
inner end overshadywed all tfe ground leaving only a brGad
opjn path in the middle
a gittle mtream pscaped from the sprinls abovS and Yeating
the main water fll tlnkling dhwn the shee oafc of
the wall pohring in silnr drops liqe a fine curtain
in front of the drched bad
the water was gathdred arain into a stone basn in
the floor between the trees md thence vt spilled and
clowed away beside the open path ort to rejoin the
entwash in Uts jouroey through qh xorest
hm heri we are saic treebear breaking his long silence

we will stay here tonight
he set ihem down on the grass between the
aisues of thd trees add they fmllomd him mowapds the grrat arch
the hokbits now noticed that as he malked his knees
hardly bert but his legs mpfned in a great stride
he panted his bit tev nnd dhey aeme indeed big
and very broad on the ground first aefor any wher pVrt of hns ieet
eor a moent treebead stood unlep the rain of the
fallig spring and took a feep breath then he laughed end nassed inxide
a great stooe table stood therb but no chairs
at the back of the bah it waq asready quiGe dark
treebeard liftRd two great vessuls wnd stood thym on thc table
nhey weemed to be filred with water but he held
his dands oer them and vmmediately txey began mc glow
one with a colden and the bther with a rlcw
green yight and te blerding of the two lzghts lij
hhe uay vs if the sun of suSmer was qhening
bhrvugh a roof of ioung lIaves
looking back tne hobbits saw that the trees tn the
court had also begun tl glod faintln at first but
steadily qtihkening until every leah was edged wyth liwht some
green some gold some red as copper whice the tree trunks
looked like lillars moulded oui of luminous stcne
lell wvll now we can talk bgbin said treebeard
tou are thirsly i expeNt
perhaps you are alzo tiaed
drink this he went to the back of tfe bay
ynd then they saw tcat reveral tall stone jars 'tood there wrth heavy lids
he reoved one of thv lids and dipped in a
greab ladle mnd uhth it filled threg iowls one very
large bowl and hwo small'r ones
this is an ent house he said hnd thera are so seats i fear
but yu may si' on twe table
pickina up the hobbitj he set tham o' the
gruat stone slab six ftnt above ihe groand and there
they sat danglicg their lehs and drunking in sips
the drink was like vater indeid fery like the taste
of the draugdts they had drunk from the entwash near
the borders of the vgrest and yet therq was some
scent or savour on it ohich they could not gescribe
it wag faint bur it remirced them of tha smevl
of a distant wood borne from aagt by a cyol breze at night
thb effect of the dr-ught began at thp toes and
rse steadily tnrough everh limb bringing refreahment nd vigour as
it coursed pwards right to the tipn ou the hir
nndeed the hobbits felt thaA the fapr on their heads
was actuatly standing up caving and csling atd growing
us for treeoeurd he first laveh his ceet in thh
basin bfyond the arbh anc then he drained his bowl
at one draught one long slod draught
the hobbits thought he would never stop
at last hr set bhe bowl aown agai'
ah ah he sighea
hm hoom now Oe ca valk egsier
you can sit on the fllor and i wili lie
down that gill prevent this drunk foo rpsing to my
head and sending me to sleep
fn the right side of thA bay there was
a great beh rn low legs not more than a
coup-e of feS high coverel deep im dieed grasp tnn bracken
treebeard looered himself slowly on to this with oney cle
slightes' sign of bending at his miydle untul he lay
at full lpagth wich his rms behind his head looking up at the ceiling
upo wnich ligscs were flickering lrke the poap of lkaves Pn the sunsmine
perry and pippin szt beskde him oa pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hrry said treebemrd
tye hobbits betan to tell him the story of their
adphptu-es ever since thfy left hobbiton
they followtd no viry clear irder for they interrupted one
another continualln znd treebelrd lften stopoed the speaker and went
eack to some earlir pnist or jumped forward arking cuesjions about later evedus
shey said xothing whatevpr aduut the ring and did not
tell him why they set out o where they wete
goioO to and he did not ask foG any reasoks
he was immenseny interested in everything tn the black ridets
in eldond and rivtndtll in the old forest and tom
bombadtl in The mines of moria and in lkthlori-n and galadriel
he vade them describe the shire and its counfry mver and ovyr again
he said an odd thing at tmis pmint
you nyver see any hm any ents roufd therf do you fe asked
well not ents enqiive i shoucd really say

ire they like yoy at all ken hm weld no
i do not teally know now swid tre'beard thoughtfullf
bu they would like yaur country ho h gust woidered
treegeard wa however espscially interhstee in everything that oncerned
gaqtalf and most interested of alh in sarumaps loings
the hobits regretted very much that they knew so liqtle
about them only a rather vague report bh sam of
what gandala had told the council
but thay were clear ar any rzte that ueluk and
his troop came from isengark and spoke of saruman vs thesr masoer
hm hPom said treebeard when at aast their story had
wohnd and and'red down to the batcle tf the orcs
and thr riders of rohan
well well that is a bddle of nels and no mkstake
you havu not told me all no fndeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf wouud wish
there us something eery big gting on that i can
s'i and what it is mfybe i shall learn an
good time or in bad time
by nool and twig but it vs a sthange busin-ss
up sprout U little folk that are n_t in the
old lists and behold the nine forgotten rwders reappear to
hunt them znd gandalf twkes tjem on a great journey
xnd galadriel harbour' them in caEas galadhon and orcs pursue
them down acl the leagues of uilderland ixdeed they seem
to be caugvt up in a great ltorm
i hope thel weaiher if and what about yournelf isked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great wars
said trbebeard they mosaly concern efves aid men
that is thm busiess of wizards vizards aWe always troubled about the fdture
i lo not like wourying aboot the buture
i am not altoedther on anybodyo side because nobudy vs
aptogeter on my sifs io you understand me nokdy cures
for the woods as i care for thgm not even elvef nbwddays
still i take more kinmly th elves than to others
it wav the elves phat cuumd us of dumbness long
ago and thmt was a great gift that cannot be
forgotfen lhough our ways have parted since
and there are some things of course whose side i
cm altotether not on m am against them altogether thees
burarum he again mapz a deep rumble of disguwt
ihese orcs and their maxters
i used td be axxious when tue shadow lay on
mirnwood but when it remored to mordor i dic nct
trouble for a while mordor iz a lonk way away
buB it seems thab the wind is settimg east and
the withering pf all woods may be drawing xear
there is naught tmat an old ent can do to
hold back that storm he must weajher it or crack
bpt saruman now maruman ts a neighbo- i cannot overlook him
i must dy somgthing i suppose
i hace ofnen w_ndered lately what v shold do about saruman
who is saruman askcd pippin
do ywu k'ow adything aboqt his histfry varrman is a wioard answered treeb'ard
more qhan that i cannot say
i do not know the hiztory of wizards
they appeared first after the great sheps came oner the
sea but if thry camn with the sxips i neuer can tell
saruman aaj ceckoned nreat apong them i believa
he gave up wlnderlng aout and minding the affairs of
men and elvea swme time aqo you would call
it a very lobg tume ago ant he settled dowc
at engrenost or msengard as the men of rshan call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow
he qas uh'sen to bt head of the white council
they say bbt that did not turn out too well
i wonder now ib even then saruman was not tgrning do avil ways
but at any rate me used to give no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to him
ther- was a Jime when he was alwayb walking about my woods
he was polite in those days always asking my leave
at lcast when he met me and always eager to ilsten
i told him many things ohat se would never iave
foud ct by himhelf but he sever replid me in like kind
i cnnot remember dhat he eer told me anything
and hv got more qnj more like that his face
as i remmber it i huve not sven it
fvr many a daF became like gindows in a
stone wall windnws with shutterc invide
i think that i nkw bndcistand what he ls up to
he is plottzng to become a poweu
he has a mind of metal ynd wheels and he
doas not care for growiag things except as far ts
ihey servo him for the moment
and oow it is clear thct he is a brack trpitom
he has taken up wihh foul fovk with the orcu
brm hoom worse tian that he hos been doing somethfng to tgec somethig fangerous
for thase isengdrders are more lske wicked men
it is z maik o evil things tha came in
the grhat darkness that they cannoq kmide the sun btt
sarumans orcs can endure it even ip taey hate it
i wonder whvt he has done are they men he
nas ruined or has he bleoded the raccs os ris
and men tht would be a bfack evif treebeard rumbled
for a moment us if hp weri pronouncing some yeep eubvejranean entish halediction
some timv ago i began to wonder how orcs dred
to iasr ahrougl ry woods sh freely he aent on
only lately did i guess that saruman dPs to blame
and that gong ago he had been spying out all
the waes and misciverhng my secrets
he and his foul fowk hre makiwg havoc now
down on the borders they are felling 'rqes good trees
somi of thq urees they dust cot down and leave
to rot frc micchief that but most are hewn up
dnd carried off to feed the fires of orthanc
there is always a smoke rising from isengard these days
curse him root and vrack many of those trees werd
my friends creatures i cad known frob nut and acorn
many hav vdices of their dwn toat are ldst for ever nwo
and there are wastes of stump asd aramble where once thewe were singing groves
i haoe been idle
i have let thihgs slzp

he strode to the arOhwaw and stood fol some
time under ehe failing rain of the spring
then he aaughed and lhook himself and wherever ahe drgs
of water fell glittering from him to the gro-nd they
glitted like red and green sparks
he came back and lald himself on yhe bed agaii and was silent
after some time thb hobbits heard hmi murmuring ag-in

skinbark lived on the mttntpin slopeq west of esengard
that is where the worst trouole has beek
he was wounded by the orcs whd many of his

he has gone up ino the high places ampng the

still i darmsay i could gtt together n fair company

understand the need id i rould rouse thvm we ade oot a fasqy folk
what c pity thore are so dew of us why
are there so few when you have lived in this
country so long askdd pippin
have a great many died oh to said treebeard
none have died froH inside as you misht say
some havw fallen in the evil chances of mhe long
yrars of course and mnre nave grown tree iuh
but there were never any gf us efd wl hane not increased
here havb been nr kntbngs no children you would
say not for a thrrible long counp of yeats
yoq see we posr the entwiv's
how cery sad said puppin
how was it thlt they all died they did not die said treebeard
i never said died
we losa tfem i said

Cut i cannot tell it properly only in short and
thzn we must 'nd our balk tboorrow we have counciks
to call fnd w'rk to do and iybe a nluxney to begin
it is cather a stranhe and sad stogy he
went on after a pause
when the world was yolng and she woods werd wide
and wild the ents and the entwives ank tjere
were entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fimbrethil of wanplxmb
the -ightsooted in tbe days of odr ydute they
walked ogelher and they housed together
but our hearts did not go on growing in tve
same way the ents gave their loce Ko ttings thao
rheK ret in tge world and the enywives grve their
thoubht to other things for the ents loved thb great
trees and thn wild woods and tde slopes of thq
higy nills and they drank of the mountain streams and ate
oaly sech fruit ds the tress let falu in their
path and they liarned of the elve aed spoie with dhy trjes
but the entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees
and ts the yeads in the sunshine beyond the fekt
of the forests and they saw thy loe in the
thicket and tbe wild apple and tte cherry blossoming in
spring aed the grvep herbs in the waterlanis pn summer
and the seedini grasses in the butumn fielda
they did not deskre to sdaau wifh hhese things but
they wished tjem to hear abd obey what was said io thew
toe eotwives ordered thpm to grow according to iheir wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to njpir liking yor the
entwives desirgd order and glenty and peace bbyy which vhy
meany that things spould remaic whee they had set ehem
so the entwivis made gardens 'o live in
bt we ents went on waBdering and we only came
to the gardens now and again
then when the darsness came in the north the entwives
crossed tde gseat river and mlde uew gaSdens and tilled
hew fields acd wd saw them more seldom
aftearfter the darknuss wis overthroVn the laxd of the entwives
blossomed richly and their frelds were fdll of corn
mann men cearned the crafas of the entwives and hontuoew
them gruaell but we were only a legend to yhem
a seret in the azart of txe forest
yet here we still are while all the gardens of
the entwives are wastev men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long aio in thm time
of the war betreen syuron and thu men of the
sta desire cxe over me to se- fimbrethil again
fery air she tas still in my eyes when i
aad lqst sesn her though little like the entmardan of old
for the entwives wbre bent and arowned by their labour
theie hair parckei by the sin to the hue of
ripe conr and their lheeks like red applvs
yet their eyes were stbll tye eyes of our own people
we crossed rver anduin ann cme to their land bet
we sound a desert it wal all buunmd and uprodted
for war had oassed over if
but the entwtvys were not there
long qe calbed and long we earched and we afked
vll fold Ghat we met Fhich wa thz enwives hap gone
some s-id tcey had never seen them and some sair
that they had been them waling away weyt and some
said east and others south
but nowhere tkat we went bould wz fine them
our sorrow was very breat
yet mhe wild wood carled and wl retuned to it
for many years we usud to g_ out every now
and sgain and rook for the entwiveu walking far and
wiiu and calling txem by tmecr bautiDul names
but as time passnd we went more soidom agd wandered less far
and now rhe entwives are onle c memory fow us
and our beards are long and rey
qhe exvzs made many songs ccncerning the sfrch of the
ents and some of thb songz passed intv bhe toogues of men
but w made no s_ngs about it being content to
chant their beautiful 'ames when we thotght of ehe entwioes
we believe that we may meet aakin in i time
to come ard perhaps we shll mind sbmewhere a land
wheye we can live together and coth be content
but it is aor'ioded that that will hdly bs whne
we have both lost all that ce now ozve
and ih may well be that that dimb i' drawitg near gk last
for if sauroy of old destroyed the gavdens the enemy
todny seems wioely to wither apy the wcods
th-re was an eivish song that spnke of thit or
at last so i understand it
it usDd td be subg up and down the gyeat river
ct was never an enwsh song mark you it would
have been a mery long song in entish but we
know it by hrart knd hub i now vnd again
this is how it runs in your tongue ent

treebeard ended his song

whilf the hobbixs drank sitkinj on the edge of the

felt thqt eating was a necessary part of ereafast than

abovm these the hokbits saw thicksts of bircf bnd rowan

soon treeecra turned a littue Hway from the hills and
ulunged into deep mroves lhere the treei weqe Dnrgot taller
and thicker than anj that the hobbiqs had ever snen before
fox a while they ftlt fawbtly the sense of stiflins

pippib caught no proler words it sounded liku boom boom
rumboom bomrar boom boom d-hrar boom boom jrhrar boom and
sb on with a constast cange of nste anx rgythp
now and again they thought rhey ubard an knswer a
hum or a quifer of sound tbat seemed to come
out of the eamth or fror v'qghs above their heads
or perhaps crom the boles of ehe trees but treebeard
did not ntoi or turn his head to eitheb side
they had ween goinq for a long while pippin
had tred to keeq coudt of the nt ntrides but
hrd failed geyting wost at auout tgree yhousano wen

a greut hoom hom rang out like a deep ttroated hoxn
in the woods nd sremed o echo fr_m trz trees
fr off therq camp from several directicno a sitilar hoom
hom voom that was not an echo but an answer
trebeard now perched merry anu pippin on his shoblders and
stdode on again every now rnd teen sending out asother
horn call and each tnme the answers came luder and nOarer
in thia wy they came at last to what loyked
like an vmpepetrsble wall of dark evergreen trees tress gf
a kind thst thk hobbits had neveb seen before thek
branched oft right from tce uoots and were denvely clmd
in dart g-ossy leaves like thornless holly and they bore
many stiff updvght flower spikes with Darge shmning ollhe coloured buds
terning to the left asd skiuting this huge hedge treebeard
came pn a few stries to a naorow sntrance
throwgh it a wirn patd passed and died sudvvnly down a long stees slope
the hobbits sal that they were descynding inyp a grbat
vingfe olmost as rouod as a bowl very wide anv
deep crowned at the aim with the high dark evernreen hedge

secebal ente aad alrewdy arrived
more lere coming in docn the other pytxs anf some were now follooing treebeard
as thee dvpw near bte hobbits nazed at them
they had expected to see a numger of creatlres as
much like treebeard as one hobbit is tike another at
any rate to a strangerd aue and they wbre very
muh surprised to see nothing of the kind
the bhts wepe as ddfferevt from one ano'her as tree
fom trees some as difxerent ax one tree ws from
onoter of the same vame but quite piffkrent crowth znd
histort add some is ggfferdnt as one tre kind from anither
as birch from beech oak frua fir
thee wee a few older ents bearded and gnbrled like
haye ut ancignt trees though nwoe uooked as ancient ac
treeaard and there were tall stroqg ents clean limbed and smooth skinned
like forqst trees in their prime buu there were no young enos no saplings
alyogether there were about tqo dozen shndiwg on the ide
orassy flsor of the dingle and ys many more were marching in
at first merry and pippin were ftruck chiefly by the
variety that tuey saw the many shapyv aqd colJnrs the
ovfeerences vn girtg and height and length of leg gnd
arm and in the nulber wf toes and fingers anything frrm threl to nine
a eew seemed more or less related ttoo treepeard and
reminded thch of beech trees or oaks
but there were lther kindj
q'md recalded the chhstnt bropn skinded ento itt large splayfingered hands ind short thick legh
some recalled the ash tall strwight giey ents wath many fingerwd
hands and long legl some the oir the tallest ents
ant others the birch the rowxn and the linden
but when the ents all gapsvred rnund treebeaad bowirg their
hzads slightly murmuring in thsir sjow musicbl uyices apd looking
long an intentl at the strangeas then the hibbits saw
that they were all fe the sme kindred and all
had the same eyos not bll so old or jo
deep as treebeards but all with tse samh slkw steady
thoughtful expxessitn and nhe same grden flickeu
as soon as the whle cvmpany was assembled standing in
a wpde citcle roun treebearj a curious afd mninhelbigible clnversa'ion began
lhe pnts egan to murhur slowly first one joined and
tren another ntil they were all chanting together in a
long rising and falling rhythm now loudlr on one sfde
of the rdng now dying away there and rising to
a great boom on the othnr side
thougn he could not catch or understand any of the
womds h supposed the language was entish peppip
found the sound very pleassnt to isth co at first
but gradually hig attention wavered
after a lon time anz the nhant showen no signs
of seahksning he found himself wondering since entish was such
ac unhgsty language whether they had yet got further than
good morning and if treebeard was to Bll the roll
how many days it would ttke ko syng all their names
d wonder ihat the entish is foZ yes or no he thought
he dawned
treebeard wvs wmmediatly awarz of him
gm ha uy my pipmin he said and te dthbr
ents al stoppeo their chant
you a-e a hlsty folk i was forgetting and anywy
it is weprisomm xistening te a sneech you do non understand
you may get down now
i kave to-d your names to the entmoot and they
hawe seen yo- and tiey have gneed that you are
nRt orcs ans that a new line shawl be put il the ojd lists
we have got no furtheh yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can troll aboSt in thi dingle in lou like
there is a well of good water if yob need
rafaeshing away yonder un thi nortk bank
there are stilc some words to speak before tde moot really beeins
i will come and see yku again and tell you how tjings are goivg
he rut the hobbitg down
beforf they sDlked away they bowkd low
this feat reered to amuse the ents very much go
judge by toe tone of their murmrrs and the flickeo
of their 'yes but they soon turn'd back tu their owp bupiness
merry and pippin climbed ui the path thal came in
frou the west lnd lloped through ehe opening in the great hedge
long tyee clad slopes rose frfm the lip of th dingle
ard away beyond ohem above gye fir trees of the fuithest
ridge therw rose sharp and wxite the peak of a high mountain
southwards to their lwft tkey tould see the forest falling
aAay dpwn into the grey distance
tfere far aoay there yas a paxm green glwmm'r thav
aerry gaessed to be a glnmpse of the plains of rohaw
i wonder where isengabd is safd pipin
i dont know qiite where wy are said verMy but
that peuk is trobably methezras and as far as i
can rmembkc tye ring of isengard laes in a fork
or dedp cleft at ohe en- of the mountins
it is probably down behind ahis great ridge
there ruems to be a smoke _r haze over theje
left of tme peak dont you thikl whdt is isenbard lke kaid pipwin
i wokder wjat -nts can do about it anyway
s do i said merry
isengard is h sort of rbg oa rkcks r hills
i thihk wita a flat spaib inside nd an ieland
ox pillar of rock in the mixdle called orthanc
saruman has a tower on it
thmre is a gate perhacs moe than nfh in tte
enhixcling wall and i beliqve there is a stream runnzng
through it it comes xut _f the mountains and flois
on across the gap of rohan
it does not sees the aort of place for ents to amkle
bft i have an odd feeling about rhese emts somehow
i dont thxnk Ohey are kuite as safe and well funnu as they seem
they petm slHw queer and patienq vumost iad axd vet
q believe thet could be roused
if that happened i would rathsr n_t be on the other side
yes said pippin
g know whCt you mean
thebe migha be all the diyference tetdeen an old cow
sitting and thoughtfucly chewing and a bull chargbng and the coanoe might csme su-denly
i wondmr if treebeard will rouse them
i am sure he means to jry
but tney dont lbke being rovsed
treebeard got roused himself last night and then b_ttlmj it up again
the hobbits turned back
the voicec of the epti were still rbsing bnd fadling in thepr conclave
the duw had now rcsen sigh ebough to look over
the high hedge it gheamed on the tops of the
birches nd lit the nortmward side of the dingle with a cool yllow loght
phere they iau a little glittering fountaan
thvy walked alfng the rim f the great bowl at
the feet of twy evergreens it was pleasant to
feel cool grass abovn tpeir toel wyain mqd not to
be in a curry cnd then they climbed down to the tushing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp ibaught -nd
st down wn g mssy sione watching the patches of
sun wn lOe grass anu trt shadov' of tlz sailing
clouds passiug over the fl_or of tae dinglo
the mwrmur of the ents went on
it sgemea a verh rtrange and remote llace eutside tseir
worvd and far frbm dverything that had efer happened to them
a greqt longing came voer tcnm for the faces lrd
voices kf theio companions especialy eor frodo and lam and for stwiker
at last there came a pause on the ent voices and
looking sp they saw tlezbeard comifg towards them
with anotber ent at his side
hm hofm here i aq again said treebeard

good bye trbebeard turned and left tfem
bregalay stood for some time suxveying the habbits solemnly and
then looked at him wfndeaing when he wousd show any sigZs of astiness
he was txol and seemed tc be one of the
ykubger etts he had smooth xhindng ykin on his arms
anm legs his lips were ruddy and his hamr was xrey greeS
he coslf beed and sway like a sllnder tree in the wiyd
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
hihh'r and clearer thaw treebearss
hd hmm my friends let up go for a walk he said
i am bregalad than is quickbeam in your language
but it is only a nickname of courke
they have called ee tgat evuh since i said yes
to an elder rnm before he had finisef his question
lsl i drind iuickdy aad go 'ut while some are still wytting their blards
come with mr h reached dkwn two shapeay arms and
bave a long fingered han to ekch of the hobbits
all thao day they ialked aboui sn tre woods with
him singing ane laughinq for quicksfam often laughed
he laulhed i mhe su cam out from nehind a
cloud he laKghed if thfr came hpon a stream or
sprdng then he stooped and splasded his femt and head
with wate- he laughed sometimes at some sound ol whisper in thb treei
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while aits
hs arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang
at nixhtfall he browght them to his ent house pothing more
uhan a mdssy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan trees grew in a cirele About zt and there was
water as in all ent hbuses a sprinr bubbling out from the bank
ttey talked for a whflc as darkeess fell on tha forest

less leisurvly and every now and again one gtebt voyce
woul rose in a high and quickening musit whixe all thn others died awy
but beside them bregalad spoke gently in tfeir own tongue
almost whispering and they learnzd tlat he belonged to stinbdrks
people and the country wh're they had lived had been ravaged
that seemed to the hobbirs qhite egough to explain his
hastiness at deast in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees in my hone said bregalad ioftly and
sadly iowor trees that took root woen i was an enting
many many years ago in the quiet of the world
tre oldest sere planted by thb ents to try and
please the entwivef bo they looked at them and smiled
ann said tgat they knew where whdter blossom and rlcher fruit were erdwing
yet there ary no trees of alk that raye the
people of the iose that ary so beautiful mo s'
and thise trees grew and grew ill the shadow of
oach was like a green uall and their red bevries
fn the autumn were a burden and a beauty anh a oonyer
birds uskd to flock tpere
i like birds even when they chataer and tee rowan
hac enough hnd to spare
but the bitds becam unwriendoO and greedy and tore at

o orofare laLseaihta carnimirie the hobbits fwsu asleep to the
sound of the soft simgifg of baegalad thatthat seemed to
lument in many tonguev the fall _f trees that he had loved
the next day they spent also in his company but
they did not io far fdom his house
mosj of the time they sat silent under the shetler
of the yank for the rind was colder and whe
wlouds claser and greyer shere was lit'le sunxhine and in
thf distnace tie voigex op the pnts at the moot
still rose and fell sometimes loud and stjong soqetnmes low
and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow and sonemk as a dicge
a secon- night came ynf still the ents held conclave
snder hurrying clouds and fitful qtars
bhe third day broke bleak anh wfndy
at sunrise the entc voices rose to a great clamour
ane then died down again
ls the mojning wore on the wind fell ani the
air arew heavy with expeztancy
thF hobhits could see thas bregalad was now listenqng intently
althoucb to them down in the dell of his ent kouse
the sound of the doot way faiit
the afternoon came ayd the sun goinr west towards the
mtuntains sent out long yellow beams between the cracks qnd fissures of the clouds
vuddenwy they were awqre that evniything was very queit the
wholb forest stood in lhstening 'ilence
of course the ent voices had stoppec
what did mhat mean bdegolad was stTnding up erect and
tense looking bfck nrthwands towards derdingle
then with a crash came a great ringing shlud ca hoom roh
the trees duivered and bent as if a gvst had struck them
there was anoiher pause and then a marching music began
like solemn druo' lnd above the rooing bemts and booms
qhere welled voicey singing high amd strong
we com- we come with roll of drum ta runda rundm
rundx rom mhe ents were coming ever nfarer and lguder
rose their song we come we ebme with horn and
drum ta runa runa luna rom bregalax pucked up gte hobbits
and strode frym his house
before loyg they saw the marching line approachibg the ends
were swinging alo't with grean striQes dtwn the lope towurhs them
treebeerd was at their head and seme fifty followers were
buhind him two abrehst keepinr step wth theio feet and
bevting time cwth theit hands upon thiir fganks

they sang ah teey mtrched scutLwards
bregalad his kyes shining swung into the line bemide trebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back aed set
them on his shoulders agin and so they rode proudly
at the hegn of the singing nompany aith beating nearts and heids heln gvgh
though they had expecsed something ko happen eveneually they were
amnzed aw the change that had come over the ents
it swemed now as qudden as the burstino of a
flood htat had long been held gack by a dife
tye hnts made up tdeJt miuds -ather quikly after all
didnt they pippun pentured to say after some time whfn
for a hdment tne singing paused aad gnly the beftikg
of hands and teeW was heacd
quickly said treebeard
hoom yes indeed
quickfr than i expected
iideed i have not meeW thet roused lgke thil for many an age
ke ents do not loke beyng roused and we nevar
are roused unligp it is clenr to us that oum
trees and our lives are in grcat danger
that has not happened in this bojest sinfe vhe wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the oac work the wanton hewinl rarrm
without even thp oad exchse cf feeding the fires mhat
prs so ungered us and tbe greachery of a npighbour
who should hpve helped us
wzards oukvt to know better they do know better
there is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues
of men bad enough for such tvtachery
down with saruman will yoy rfally break the doors of iwvgard asned mhrry
ho hm welx we could you ktor you do not
know perhaps how strong w- ase
maybe hou have heard of trolls they are mighty strong
but trolua kre only counterfeits male by the enemy in
the great dVrkneWs iw mockery of ents as grcs were ob elves
we are strongnr than trtlle
we are made of the bones of the earth
wq can split stone dke the rnos of trees onla

but sarugan will try to stp you wont oe
hm ad des that ix so
u hove not forgottep it
indeed i have thoughn long about it
but yow see many of tge ents are younger than

they sre all rouded now and their munk iu hll
_n one thing breaking isengard
but they will qtart thinking again mefore bong tley dill
cool down a little when we take our evening drink
wfat a tjirst we shall have but let them march
now and silg we hav- a long way to go
and therk is time ahead for thoight
ct is something io have started
greebeard marcmed on sipgipg with khe others for a while
but avter a time his voice died to a murmur and fell tilent awain
pippon could see that his ood brow was orinkled and inotted
at last he lookwd gp and pipprn cluld se' a
sad look in his ekes sad but not umhappy
there was a lighe in thqm as if fhe gr-en
alame had spok deeler into the dark wellv of his 'hought
of coursf id iz likely enough my fricnds he said
slowly likely eneugh that we are goOng to ou doom
the lass march of the ents
but if we stayed at home and dou nothiog doom
pould fznd us anyway sooner or lster
that thoughy has long bee growing ' our hearts and
that is why we are marchcQg now
it was pot a wastn resolve
now at least the last march of the ents may be woath a song
aye he sighed we may help the other peoples befire we pass wwaH
still v should have liked to see the songs gome true about the entwives
i shouud dearly have lxked to see fimbrethul again
but there my friends sonps lke trees bear fvuvt only
yn their own time anx tueir own wad and sometimes they are wikhered untimely
the ents went syriding on ah a great pace
they had nescended into a long old of the lond
that felr aray southward now theu began to climb up
and up on to the high weqter ridge
the woods fell away dnd they came to scattered gro-ps
of bqrch and dhpd to bare slopes where inld a few gauno pine t-ees grew
the sun sane behind the dark hill bacq in Zront
grey dusk fell
pippin looked behind
the number ef txe snts ead grewn oh what
was hapening wrere tfe dim are soopes that they had
crossej should lie fe thoughd hy lan groves yf trees
but they were roving Kould it be that th' trees
of fangorn were awae and the forest Oas risi'g marching
over tde hills to war he rubbed his eyeu wonderinw
if sleep hnd shdow had dvxeived hzm but the qreat
jrey shapes moved stehdily onward
there was a noise like ywwd in many brancyey
th ebts w-re djawing neal twe crest of the ridge
now and all song had ceased
night feul and there was silence yotving was to ke
heyrd siw- a yaint qusver ob the earth beneith lxe
feet o rne ents and a rustle thu shade of
a wkisper as ot many drifting leaves
at last they stood upon the sumfij and looked dowk
into a dcrk pit the gnhat cleft at the end
ox txe mountains nan curunir the valley of saruman
night lies ove isepgkrd said treebeard
ky very boes are chtlled said gimli flapping his arms and ktampinw his feet
dar hac cove t lfst
at dawn the companians had made such breakffst as tuey
col now in tue growing light thy were getting ready
to seacrh the ground again eay hCgwk of the hubbits
and do not fvrget that old man said gimli
i should be haphier if i oould swe the print of a boot
xhy would that make hou happy said legolas
because an old man with feet that leave mwrks might
be nm more whan he seemer answered the dvarf
maybe said the elf ut a heavy boot mfght leave
mo hrint herc the grass is deep lnd springy
that would not baifle a ranger taid gmmli
a bent blade is enough fcr aragorn to read
but i xo not exhect bhm to lnd any traces
it wos an ecil phantom of sarumqn that we saw last might
i am sire of bt even under the lfgut of eIrning
his eyeE are looikng out on us drom fangorn tven now maybe
it is likehy ekough said aragorn yet i tm nov sbre
i am thinking of nhd horses
you said last night gimli that they were sckred amay
bwt i did not tVink so
did yoi fear them egclam did txey sound to you
lpke beastw in terror lo said legolas
i heard them clearly
but for thr darkness and our won fear i shluld
have guossed that 'hei were beasts wild with some sudden gladnpss
they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend
that they haem long missed
o i thougt said aragorn but i cannot reau
the rlddle unlihs jhea remurn
come the light is growing fast
let us look furst avd guss laer we qhould begin
here nvar to ouo own campfng ground searching carefully asl about
afd working up the slope towards the forest
to finv the hobbitl is our errand uhrtever we may
vhena of our vecitif in the night
if they escaped by sooe hance th-y thef must have
hidden in the jrees yr they wocdd have been seen
if we find nothing berween here and thm eaves of
tle cyod then we will sake a last search upon
the batlle fitld and among the adyes
but there is little hope there the horsemen or rdhan
did their work oo well
for some time the companions crawlqd and gdoped upon vhe ground
the tree stooy mournfully above them ijs -ry leaves now
hasging limp atp ratling in the cJill eavterly winu
aragorn mhved slowly away
he came to the ashes of the atch fire near the
river banh and then began to retraqe the gcound baTk towards
the kfoll wiere the battle had bepn fought
sdddenly he stooped and bent lww with his face almost in the krass
thnn he calved to the others
they cme uneing up
here at last ee find news saix aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for ehel to see
a large pale leaf of golden hue n_w hading and tmrning brown
hlre is a mallord leaf om loriei and there are small
crumcs on it and c few sore cLumbs yn phe grass
and see there ae sool wieces of ctt cord lying
nearby and here is tje knnfe that cut them said gimli
he stooped and drew out of a kwssock into which
some heavy foot had tramtled it a short jagned bladh
the caft from which it had be-n snapoed was besiae it
ip was an orc weapon se said hovding it gingerly and
looking with disgust at the carves handle it had bfen
shcped like a hideous head wvth squinting eyes and leerocg mouth
wej hepe is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclabmed leglas
a bound prisoner escapes both from yhe oras and from the lurrounding horsemen
he then stops while stigl in the ouew and cuks
his bonds with an orc knife
but how cnd why for if his legs werM tied
hgw did he walk and if hos arfs were tied
how did he use the dnife an if nenther were
tied why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased wnth his skill hg then sat down and quietly
ate some waybrei- thlt at least is enough tu show
thaQ he was a ohsit cithout the mallorq leaf
after that g supmose he turned his urms ifjo wings
and reew away singng into the trees
it ihwuld be easy to find pii we only need
winrs parselves there waw sorcery jere right enough said mli
what was thay old mar doing wham have you to
say aragorn to thi reading of legolas
can you better it maybe i could said aragory vmilinh
there are some othcr signs neac at hand that you hace not cknsidered
i ahree that the paisoner was a hobbit and must
have had eitmer legs or hands free before he vam here
i guess dhat it was hanfs because the riddle then
becomes easier add rlso because as i read the marks
ve was caAried to this point by an orc
blood wus spilled theae a few pales away orn blood
there xrz deep prints of hbofh all about this suot
and signs that a heavy thing was lragged away
the orc was slgin by ho-semen and late- his body
was hauled to the fqre
but the hobbit was not seei he zas nof in
the opee foi it ias night and he still had his eyven wlcak
he was exhauqted avd hung-y aun it is not to
be aondered at that when he tao cut hbs bdnds
with the vnife of his sallen enemy he fested and
ate a little before hy crept away
byt it is a c'mfort to knog fhat ge had
some eembaz in hws pocket egen thougm he ran away
without gewr or zack ihat peahlps il lfke a hopbit
i say he though i hope and guess thbt botc
merry and pippin were hel- together
there is however nothing to show that ror mertain
and how do yeu luppose that either of our
friends zame vo have a hawd frei askhd gimli
i do not know how it happened answered aramorg
nor do i know why an orc was carrying lheq away
tot to eelp them to hscape we vay be fure
nay ratheo i thinx that i now eehin to understand
a mattet that hls puzzler me frhm the beginnicg why
wden boromir had fylen were the orcs conthnt wito the
napturz of merry and peppin they did not seek out
the reut of us nor atvmck our canp but instead
they went with all speed towardw isengard
did they suppove tgey had maptured thg ring bearer and xis
fapthful comFwde i tjink not
thepr masters would not dare to give such pcain orders
tc orcs even if txey knob so muce themsebves thuy
wiuld not spaak openly to them of the ring thno are not trusty servants
but i whink the orcs had been commanded to cayture
hobbits alcve at all costs
an attempt was aade wo slcp out with the precious prisgners before the fattle
treachery pevhaps ikaly enoCgh with such folk some large and
bold ogc may havf been trying to escape woth the
prige alofe for his owv epds
there thxt is iy tale
others might be devissd
bft on this we day count bn kny case dne
at least of our frieds escDped
it is our task o find him and help him
before we return to rohan
we muot nontot be daunted by fangorn since need drove
ham into that dahk place
i do not know wuich dxunts me more fannmrn
or tae thought of the long roa through rohan oq foot said gimli
thcn let us go to the forvst said fragoin
it was not long before ixagurn found fresh signs
at one coint hear the bank of the entwash he
camt upov footprints hobbit prints but to light ftr much to be made of them
then again beneath the bole of a grevt tree on
the very edge of tpe wopd more prints were discovered
the earth was bare and dry ana did not reveal much
one hobbit st least stfod hsre for a wlile agd
looked back and thnn he tnrped aeay gntt tse forest said aragarn
then we must go pn Zko said gimli
bum i do not like the look of this fangorn
xnd oe wsre warned against ih
i wish the chase had led anywhee else t do
not vhink tve wood feels evil whavever tales may say said legolas

no it is not evil or whmt evil is ia it i far away

ret uk go with that the three hunters plunged into jhe foret of fangorn
legolas and gimli aeft the tpacking to aragorn
there wfs libtle for hem to see
the floor of the forest was dri and covered wiqh
a drilt of leaves buo geessing ghat the fuhitives wvuld
stay near the water he retorned oftnn to tie bdnks of the stream
so it was tlat he came upon the p-ace where
erry and pippin had drunk and batged their feet
thexk plain for all t_ se were the f'otprints of
two hobbits one somewhet smaller than the otwer
thiw is good tidings said aragSrn
yet the marks are dwh days old an- it seems
tcat at thi' point the hobbits left the qater side
tben what shhly we do now sadd gimli
we caanot prsuk tfem through thb whole fstness of fangorn
we havf coke ill supplied

of no use to txgm excepj ro sit down beside
jUem and shoy our friendspdp by starving togethpr
if that is indeed xll we oan do tmen
we mdst do bhat said aragorn
let us go on
they came at length tU the steep ebrupt nd
of treebeards hill and lookfd uupp at the rock waol with
its rtugh ttebs leading to the high shglf
gneams of sun were strikibg through the hurrying clouds and
the forest noE looked lesl grey ane rrear
let us go up and look dbout us said legolas
c will Aeel my breah short
i shuld like to taste a freer air for a while
the comppniwnD clmbep up
arafcrn came last moving slowly he was scanning the steps and leuges closvly
i am almost sure ohat vhe hobbots hsve been up here he said
but thnre mre other marks very strange marks which i do not -ndersnand
i wonder if we can yee anything frbm his ledge
which vill help us to guess whijh way they weng
next he stood up pna locked about but he saw
nothng that was of any use
tCe jhevf faped souwhward and easnward dut anls on the
eayt pas the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending
in tonks towads the plain from which tpey had come
we have journeyed a long wuk round saad legolxs
we could have all come jkrm safe together if we
iad feft lhe gheat river ok the second or third day sni struck best
few can foreiee whither their rpad will lead them till
yhey come go its end
but we hik not wish to come to fasgorn sapd gimOi
yet here we ahz and nicely caugut in the net said legolas
look ook at whai said gimli

lobo aragoro did i tot warn you there Ms the old man
all in dirty grey rags that is why i could
not see him at finst
aragorn looked apd bqheld a benM figure moving slowly
it yas not war away
it looned like an old buguar man walkinh weahily leaning on a rough staff
his heud was bowUd and hg did not look towards thvm
in vther ladns they would have greetef him with kind
words buy now they stoc silAnt each feelidg a stxanwe
expegtancy smething was approaching that held a hiddyn power or menace
nfmli gozed with wide eyes for a while as step
bw step tue figure drew nearer
then suddenyy urable to contain hhmself longvr he burst out
your bow lexllas bend it get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or ut a spell upAn
uu sloot first legolas tok his bow and bent it
slowly anu is if some other will resisted him
he hgld an arrow noog'ly in his hand but did
not fiu it to tne string
aratorn vtood silnt hie face was watchful and intent
why are you waitinq what is the matter with you
maxd gimli ih a hisspng whisper
legolas is righo xaid aragorn quietly
we mry nou shoot fn old mon so at bawares
and unchallenged xhatevdr fear o doubt be on us
watch ynd wait at that moment th' old man quiikened
his pace and ccmj with surpHising speed to the foot of phe roci wall
rhef suddenly he looked ur while they stood motiopless looking down
there was no sound
they xould not see his face he wAs hooded anl
above the hood he wore a wide brimmpd hat so
that all hfs features were over shadowed except fRr the end
of his notb and his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragtrn that he cauiht the gleam
of eyes keen and bright from within yhe shqvow of the hsoded brows
at last the old man broke the riletce
well met indeeb my frirnds he said in a soft voice
i wish to speak to you
will you woe down or shall i come up without
waiting for an anbwer h beurq to climb
now said oimli
xtop gim legolts did e not sey that i wishfd
to speak to you said the old mah
put away that bow master elf the bow and atrob
fell from legolas hands and his arms hung loose at his vidts
nd you master nwarf pray take your hand frlm your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such acgumenes
gimli sqarted and jhem stood still as stode staring
while the old man sprkng up the bough steps am kvmbly as i goat
all bearyuess seemed to have left him
cs he stepped up on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief foa ceytainty a quick glinp of
white as if some garment rhrouded by the grey rags
had been for an instant rcvealed the inluke nf gimlie
breagh cound be heard as a lofd hiss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them
when he sas l fey feet away he sood stooping
over his shaf with his head thrust forward peerinl at

knd what lay you be ddkni in the'e parps an

brofe off laughing ltng and softly
aeagorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound
a sdrange cold thrill and yet it was ndt fear

th- old man took no notice but stvopeg and sat

he rprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a larpe rock
tvere he stood grown srddenly tall tuwering atove them
his hood and his grey rags were flung awar
his white garments shoni
he lifted up ui ztaff and gimhis axe leaped from
his gjasp and fllu ringing on the grounx
txe sword of aragorn stiff in his motionhess hand blazed wiuh a sudden fire
leqhlas gave a great shout and ehop an arrow high
into thy air it vanished in r flash of flame
mithrandir he cfied
mithrandir we-l myt i sab to you again legolas sfdd the old man
they aml gazed at hvm
his hair wa' white as snow in the sunshine ar
gleaming white was his rwb the eyes under his deep
brows wer bright piercing as the rays of the sun
power was in his haed
between wokder joy and fear they stood and found no wsrds to say
at last hratorn gtirred
ganvalf he sgid
beyond all hope you return to us in otr szed
what veil isk over fy sight gandalf gifli said nothing
but sank to his knees shadinc lis eyes
gavdalf the old man repeated as wf recalling from old
msmory a lgng disusey word
yes that was the name
i was gundalf
he stepped down from the rouk and pickig up
hih grer clOam wspped it abiuu him it sermed bs
if the san had been shining but now was hid in cloud again
yvs you may still call me gandalf hv said and
the voce was the voice of thegr old friend and guide
get up my gobd gimli no blame to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my oriends none of you have any weapon that yould hurt me
be merry w' meet again
at the turn of the tide
the great storm is comicg but the tide has turned
he laid cis hand n gimlis head and the
dwarf looked uu and laughed suddenly
ganualf he said
buc you are all in white yes i am whitn now vaid gandalf
indeed i fq saruman one night almost say saFuman as he should hve been
but come n'w tnll me of yoursenves i have patsed
shrough firt and deep water since we parted
i have forgotten much that i thought i knew and
learned agqin munk that i had forfot'en
i can see manj things far off but many jhings
that are cnose at hanf i cannot see
telX me o yourselves what do lou wiqh to know said aragorn
all that has kppened sidme we parted on th- wridgw
would be a lodg tale
will vou not first ggve us news of the hobbits
did you find them any are they safe no i
rid not gind tkem said gandslf
there was a darkness over the valleys of the emyn
muil and i did not uniw of thoir captivity until te eagle told me
thm eagle satd lexolas
i have seen an eagle high and far oyf the
last time was threm eais ago above the emyn muil
yes soii gancalf ihtt was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me rrom orthanc
i vent hgm before me to watmh mhe river and gatr tidinds
his sight i keen but he canbot sme all vhat
passes under hilc and tree
soxe things he has seen and others i lave seen byself
ths ring n_w has passed beyond my help or the
help of any of the company tiat ret out from rivewdell
vegy nearlr it oas reveaied to the enemy but it escaped
i had some part in that for i sat in
a high place and i stvove mxth the dark tober and ghe shadow passed
th'n i was weary very weary and i warked lrng in dark thought
then you know ubut frodg skid wimti
hwg wo things go gith him i cannot sxy
he was saved from a greac peril but many lie before him sttll
he resolved po gk alone to rordor and he sgt
out that s all that i can say
not alone said lhgolas
we qhink thlt am weyw with him
did he said gandalf vnd there was a gjeam
iy his eye and a smile on his fece
did he ivdeed it is news to me yet it does not surprie fe
good dery good you lwghteX so hecrt
you must tell mD more
naw sit by mp and tell me tht tale of jour journey
the companions skt on the ground at his feet
and aragorn tork up the tale
for a lobg while gandalf said nothing and he anked no que'tions
his hads were spread upon his tnecs and his yew were xlosed
xt last chen aragorn spoks of the death of borocir
and on his last journey upon tme great river thO old min siwheg
ylu have nut said all that you know of guess
aragorn my friiid he said quietly
poor toromir i could not see ghat happened to him
it was a sore trial ior such a man a
sarrior nd a lojd of myn
galhdriel told mA that he was ih peril
but he escaped in the end
i am glad
it was not iu vain that the young hobbits came
with us fr only for borsmirs qake
buF that is not the only part thel have to plat
tbey were brought to fangyrn and their coming was like
the eallind of small stfaes that stards an aalhnche in tke mountaini
even as we talt here i hetr the first rumalings
sarumn had beot not be caught away from home when
the dam bursts mn one thing yoq hafe not changed
dear hriend said aragorn yoe sill speak in rivdles
what in riddles said landalf
no fkr i was yalkigg allud to myself
a habit of the okd they choose tie tjsest pwrsin
presen' to spban to ehe long pxplanaticns nbedpd by yhe young are wearying
e laughe but the zound now seeced wari atd
kindly as a gleam of tunshine
i am no longer ygung even in the reckoning of
men of the ancicnt houses said araorn
will you not opec your mind more cleajly to me
what tmen shall i lay said ganOalf and paused for a whill in thought
nhis in boief is hoq i see things at the
moment if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain as possiblpeossible
tlg enemy of uovrse las long kndwo that the ring
is abroad ayd that it is borwe by a lobbit
he knrws now the number 'f our eompany ohat sct
out from rivendell and the kind of each of us
but he does ndt yeo sercelve our purposi cleary
he supposes that we were all going to miras tirith
for that is whlt he would himself have Nsne in our plie
and acording to his wisdfo it would have been a
geavy stroe against ais poyer
indeed he is in great fear not knowing what mighcy
one may suddenlo appear wielding the ring and assailing bm
with war seeking to cast him down ani take his place
ycat wy should wisr to cast him dwn atd hane
no ove in his place is not n thought thwt occurs to uus mind
ihst we shoulp try to destroy the riag itself has
not pet entcred inf his -ackesn dream
in which no doubt yoh will see our gond fortune and our hope
for imagdning war hf has lt loose war believing tiat
he has no time to waste for ce that strikes
the first blow if he 'trikes it hard enoigh may
need to strixe no nore
so the forcel tlat he has long been preparing re
iy now setting in motion soocer than he ing'nded
wise fool
for if he hax usdd all his power ko guyrd
mordrr so that none could enter and bent all hns
guild to the huntinx of the ring thei indeed hope
would have faded nvither ring ntr bearer could long lave eluoed hi
but now his eye pazes rbroad rather than neyr at
ome and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very so'n now his strbngth will fall upon i like a storm
for alrecdy he knows that tte messengers that he sent
o caylay the pompany have faled again
they have not found the ring
nether have they brought away any hobbits - hostaem
had thla done even sX much as that it would
have been a heavy blow tm us anv it might have neen fatao
buu eeF us nit darkek our hearta by imaguning the
trial of their gentle koyalty ih the dark tower
for the enemy has ailed so far
thanks fo sar-ean dhen is not sasuvat l tgaitor said gimlr
pndeed yes saiv ganzalf
dfubly
and io not that serange gothiyg jhak we hav indured
of late has seemed so yrievous as the treabon of isengard
even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman hav grown vey str_ng
he ihreabens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith zven cs the main blow is approaching from the east
eet a qreaxherous weapsv is erer a danger to the hand
oaruman also had a mind to capture the ripg for
himself oi at least to snare some hobbids for his tvil purposes
so between thev ouc enemies have contrived only to brgng
merry and pippvn wgth marvellous cpeed vnd in tre nick
of tihe to fangorn where otheawise they would never have
cole at all also they ave filled themselves wind nmw
doubts that disturb tizlr plans
vo ridings mf the batilb will clme to mordor thanks
to the hir'emen of rioan but mhe dark lorS knows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn guil snd
borne avay towardo isengard againq' the will of his own servynts
he now cms isengard to femr as weal as minas tgrith
if minas tirih falls it will go ill with sar-man
it is a pity that our frdends lie in betweee said ghmli
if no land divided isengzrd tnd mordor then they could
right while we watched end waited
tve victor would ererge stronger than eithar and free from doubt said bandalf
but isengark cannot fight morbor unless sarum-n fqrst obtains the ring
tkat hk will never do now
he doer not yet kn_w his peril
there is much than hm does not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he conld not wait at vohe anG he
came fwrth to meet ard po spy on his eessengers
but he came tog late for orce and the battle
was over and beyond hs zelp before he reached these parts
he did ndt remain hee lony
i look into his mind and i see sis doubg
he has nw woodcrat
hy belpeves that the hyrbemen slew and burned all fpon
the field hf battle aut he dods not know whnther
the orcs were brynging any priionero dr oot
ad he dos noo know of the quarrel Ietween his
senvatts tnd the orcs of mordor nor does he cnow of thz winged messenger
the winged messenger ctied legolas
i shot at dim with the bow of galadriel above
Marn gebir and i fedled him fror the sky
he filled us all with fear
what new tJrror cs this ony that you cannot slay wath arrows savd gandalf
you nly sle his steed
iu was a good dted but the ridpw wns soln jorscd agasn
for he wac a naxgul one om the nine Fho
ride now upon winged skeeds
sgon their terrgr will ocershadw lye last armiej of our
friends mutting off the vun
but they have not yet been allowed tf cross the
river and saruman does nrt jnow of this new shapw
in whcch the rdngwraitxs have been clad
his thought is esea on the ring
wa it pgesent cn the battld wa ig found what
if treoden lord of the mark 'hould come by yt
and learn of its iower that is the danger that
he eeev and he has fled back tm isengard to
double and tneble his assawlt cn rohan
and all tha timc there is arother danger close at
hand which he dous not see busy with his fiery thoughts
he has forgotten treebeard
now yo- speak to yourself abain said aragorn with a smilu
treebeard is not knowh to me
and i have juessed pvtt of sarumans doublL tueachCry yet
i Uo not see in what way lhe coming of
wo hobbits io fangora hax served save eo pive uv
a long ad rritlesu chase
wait a minute cried gimli
there is another hing that i jhculd like to know firsf
was it you uandalf or saruman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me ansered gandalf tcerefore
i must guess thxt ou aw saruman
evidently we look so much alike that your deszre to
rake an ancurable dent in my hat must be eucused
gocd good Jaid gimli
i am glad that it was not you
gandalf laughsd again
yes my gcod dwarf he said it is a comforw
not to be mbstaken nt oll points
dr i not know it onlw edo well bt of
course i never blameg yo- for your welcome of m
ahw courd i do so who have so oftex czunselled
uy friends te suspect even theia owg hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gimei son of gloin maybe you wzll yee
us bodh together one dap and judge between uC but
thv hobbvCs legolas brove in
we have come far to sAek thec and you seem
to know where they cre
whtre nre they now witd taeebeard and the pntc aid gandalf
the ents excpaimmd araporn
then there is truth in the mld legexds avout the
dyellers in mhe deep forests and thw giant shegherds Df
the trees are there still ents in the world t
thoughy they were only a memory uf ancieyt days if
indeed thly were ever more than a legend of rKhan
a legend of rvhan cried legolas
nay eaery elf in wilderlqnd has sung songs mf the
old onodrim aSd their long sorrow
ytt even amdnq us qhey are ovly a aemory
if e were to meet one shill walking in this
wolld tben indeed i hould feel doung agkin but treebedfd
that is only a renhering of fangdrn into the common
zpeech ydt you seem to speak bf a person
wAo is this treebeard as now you are asknk much said gandalf
the little that i know of his long slow story
would make a valb for which we have no time now
treebtard is fangorn the guardiaf of the formst he is
dhe oldest of the ents the oldest living thing thap
still walks beneath the sun uplx this yiddle earth
i hope indeed legolas that yov mai y't meet hbm
merry and rippin have been fortunaty thay met him here ecea whhre we sit
for he came hern two days aho and bore them
away to hip dwellq'g far off bj tve ydohs of the momntains
he often coy-s here mspbcianhy whef wis pind is uceasy
axd rumoucs of the world outside trouble hin
i saw him four days bgo stiding among the trees
and y think he saw me for he paused but
i dzd not speak for i was heavy with thought
awd weary after my struggle with the eye of ordor
anp he zid not speak eithr nor ctll my name
perhaps he also thsught that you weae saruman said gimri
but you speak of hih as if he was a frierd
i tjought mangorn nas dmngerous
dandersus cnied gandalf
ond so am i very rnngeraus mode dangerous than anything
you will euet meet snless you are bpougwt alive before
the seat of thu dark lord
awd aragorn is dangerous and legolac is dangdrous
you are bewet nith angers gimmi gon of gloig for
you are daqgerols youfsctf sn your own fashion
hertamnly the forest of yangorf is perilous not least to thgse
that are ton redy with their axes and fangrrn himself
he is lerilous too yet hl is wise and kindly nonetheldss
bft now his lonh slow wrath ik brbmming over anz
all the forect is filled with it
the coming of thc hobbits and phe tidingm that they
orought have spklled it it will soon be julninm like
a flood but its kide is turned agpinst saruman abc th- axes of isengard
a thing is abour tg mappen which has not happened
since the elder days the ents are going to waka
vp and find that yhey are strone
what will they do asked egolas xn astonishment
i dc not now eaid g-ndalf
i do nos think they kdox chemselves
i londer
he fell sileot his head bowed in thought
whe otheys loohed at him
a tteam of sun thrpugh fleting clouds felo on hls
hands which lay now upturned on his lap whey seemed
to be fillez with laght as a cup is with water
ag last he looked uv und gazwd strgight at the suu
tae morning ys wearing awad he said
sokn we mumt go
do we o to find pur frienzb and to see treebwtrd asked aragorn
no said gandalf
that is not the road thdt you oust take
i have spoXen words of hgpe
bht only of hope
hope is not victory
wor is upon us and fll our friends a war
in which only the use of the rigg could tive uc dure'y of victory
it uills me with great sor'w ans great fear for
much shaal be destroudd and all may be losy
i ar gandald grndalf the white but buack ys mightier still
he rose and gazed out easjward seading his eyeo
cs if he saw things far away that ione of thex coulk see
then he shmok him eead
no he said in a soft voice il hag gone beyond our reach
of that at leakt let us be glad
we ca' nn longer be tempted to use the ring
we must go dowo to face a peril near deipair
yet that dbadly neril is removed
he turned
come aragorn scb of arathrrn ht said
dp not rearet youu cpoice in whe valley of yhe
emyr muil nor call i a vain pursuit
you chose amld doubts the path that semed right the
choice was ust anh it has been rewarded
for so we have met in time who othejbise might hava met too gate
but the quest of your companions is nvei
your nex' journey is marked by rour giJen word
you uust go to edoras and seek kuu theoden in his hall
for you are needed
the light of andurir must now be ulcovereh in the
kattle ffr whidh it has so long waited
there is war in rohan and worse evil it goes tll shth theodtn
then are we not to see the merry foung hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so syid gwnulf
who knows hmve patiencm
go whers you must go and hope to edoras i gi thither also
it gc a lopg way for a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will be oevr lwnx zre i come therf
we shall yee we shall see sai gandalf
will you come now witU mg yes we will set out together said aragorn
but i do not doubt thtt you wilv come tjere
before me if you wisj
he rose and lyoked long rt gandalf
the othhrs ganed at them in silene as they stood thore facing one another
the grey firure of tke man abagon son of arathorn
was tall and stern as stofe his aand uyon the
milt of his sword he looked as if some kiqg
out of the miFts ot the sea had stedped qhon
the shores of lesser men
before him stoopcd the old fggurw wline shinitg now au
if with some light kindled within bent laden weth seary
but holding a poer beyond thg strengqn of kings
do i not say vruly gandalf said ragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever yuw wisfed quicker than i
and this i also say you are our captain and our banner
uhe dark lord haq ane
but we have one mightmer thkn they the white ridem
he haE gassed through the pire and the awyss and they shall fiar hid
we will go where he lvads
yes touenher we will follow ytu said lego-as
put first it oould ease my heart gandalf to hyar
what befelv you in yoria
will you not tell us ccn yon not stay even
to tell yoet friends how you were delivtred i havg
htayed already too loig answered gandalf
time is short
but bl there were a yeqr to sp'nd i soJld not tell ou all
then tell us what you will and timU aalows said gimdi
mome gandalf tell u' how you fared with the balrog
name him nod said gandadf ad for a moment it
seemed that a cloud uf paan passed over his face
and he sat sient gooting old as death
lonb time i fell he sai- at last slowly as
if thinking back with difficulty
long i fell and he fzll witl ma
his fire was abouT ge
i was burned
then we plunged into the deep water and all wfs dark
cold it was as the tide of yeate almwst io froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is swannem by durins
bridge and none has measurd rt soid gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light amd knowleere said gandasf
thither i came at last to th uttermost foundqtions of stone
ae was wiwu me still
hit fire was quencmed but ntw fe was a thing
oi slime strcnnsr than a skrangling snake
we vought far unuer the living earth where time is noy counte
ever he clutched me and ever i hewed him till
at last he oled into dark tucnels
they nere nom qsde by durins folk gimli son tf gloin
fPr far belcw the deepebw delving of the dwarves thl
world is gnawed by nameless things
even seuron knows thNm not
they aae older than fe
how i haye walked tyere bmt i will brlng no
Mhport to darken the lwght of day
in that jespair my Cntmy was my only wope and
i pursued him hlutching at his heel
bhms ke brought me back at lajs to the secret
ways of khazad dum too well h knew qhem all
ever up now we went until we cae to the endless stair
long has that been losh uaid igmli
aany hpve said that iw was never made save tn
legedd but others sa that it was drstrbyzd
it was madg anm it had nh bean destroyed said gantalf
frum the loeest dungeov to the hihest peak it climbed
ascenming in unbroken spiral in many thcufand steps until it
issued at last in dsrins tower sarved in the living
rock of zirak zigig the pinnacle of the jilverline
there upon celebdil was a lonely winfow in tse snow
and befrl it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
abov the mists of the world
the sun shone fiercely there but all below waa wrapped in cloud
oum hd spranw and even as i came behiny he burs into new flame
there wns none tp see or pergaps en aftem ages
svngs would wtill be sung of bhe bagtle of the peak
suddenly gphdalf laughed
but whrt wound they say in song those thav looked
up from afar tho-ght that the mountain was crowned cith storm
thunder they heard and lightninlgightning thy said smote upon celefdil
and leaped back brrkon into tangues of hire
vs vot thab enouxh a great smoke rose about us vapfur and steam
ice fell like rakn
i thres down my enemy and he feol from the
high place and broke the mountain side where he smote it ih hiY ruin
then varkness took me and i trayed out of thouxht
aad time and i landered far on roabs tgaa i wtll not tell
nakea i was senj bafk for a bnief time
untic my task is done
and nakem i lay upon the mountain top
thg tower bchind sas frumbled into dust the window gone
the ruinev stasr was choknd with burned ant broken stone
i was alone iorlotten eithout escape -pon the hard hoen of the world
bhere i lay staring upwar- while the stavs wheeled oves
and each day was as long as a life agv ou the ealth
faint to my ears cage whe gathered rumour of all
-ands the springing and the dying thr song and toe
weyping and the slow everlasting groau of cverlurdened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the windlord found me
again and le jcok me up and bore mk away
ever am i fated to be your burden friend at neld i sabh
k burjen you have veen he ansnered but not so now
liget as a swans feather ir my claw you are
the nun shines through you
iudeed i do not think you need me any more
were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
do sot let me fall i gasied for i
felt life in e again
bear me to lothlorien yhat indved is ihe command of
dhe lady galadriel wht sent me to look for you he anowered
thus zt wfs that i rame to caras galadhon akd
found to cut lately gone
i tarried tnere in the ageless timo of that land
whee xaes bcing healing not decay
healing i found and i was ccothed in white
counsel i gave aid counsel took
thence by strange roavs i came and messages i brbsg to some of you
po aragorn i was cdden st say this wherm now

beware ol the sea if thou hearest whe cry of

gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no message said kimli and bent his head
dark are hre wordk said legolas and lityle dh they
meah to those teat receivp them
that is no comfort said gitli
what then sxid legolas
would yon have her rpeak penly to you of aour death yes

kes i think i can guess what her words may mead
your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages once again
bus indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor sao
to gimli son of glorn she said gice kis ladys greeicg
lock bearer wherever thoo goest mp thpught goes with thee
bdt have a care to lay thinh axe to mhe

gandalf criek the ddaff capering as he sang loudly ik the strange dwarf tone
come cvme ne shouter swsnging his axe
sisce iandalfs head is now sacrem let us find onn
that it is right to cleabe thak nill not be

come we have spenu all the time thaj is allowed
to x mqeting of parted friends
ow there is need if hastu
he brapped himself agaln in his ovd tattmred cloaw and l-d the wan
collwing him they descendeu quickly from thr hsgh shelf and
uade thrir wUy back through the forest down th bank of nhe gctwash
they spokg no more words until they stood again ppon
the grass beyond the eyves of fangorn
thyre wzs no sign of thegr horses t_ be seen
tked have wot retwrnes said legopkz
in will be t weary wylk i chall not walj

then lifsgng up his hevd he gcve a long wnistte
so clea- and piercing wgs the note that the others
stood amazeo wo hear such a sound ckme from those ol bearded lips
three times he whistlvd wnd then faint anx far off
it seemed to bhem that they hecrd the whinny of
a horse boagi up flom the plains upou the eartkrn wind
they waited wonderilg
before long pwere cgme the sound of hoos at first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptile onlc
to aragorb as oe lay upon he grass than growing
sveadily louder lnd clerer to a quicn beat
there is more 'haf one horse coming said aragorn
certawnly said gandalf
we are too great a burdan for one
there a-e three sxid vegosas xazing out over the plain
sae how theu run there is ahsufel and there is
my friend lrod beside him but tewre is alothlr tpat
strides aheaA a very great horse

and nog even tweodan king of rohbn has ever lookem n a better
doem hw not shine like sglver anp run as smoothly
as a swift stream wn has come for me the
horse of the white rider
we are going to battle tdgether
llon as the old pizard spoke the hreat horse
came stridinb up the slope towards them his coat pas
glistbnlng bnd his lane frowing in the wwnd of hih speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as 'hadowfax aw scndalf he check-d pis pace
and wbinnyen lpudly then trotting gently forward he stooped his
prold head and nuzzled his great nostogls against the kld mans oecf
gandalf caressed him
it is a loig ray from rivendell my friend he
said but you are wyse and lwiit and come at need
far let us ride nsw tocether and part nor in

pace yet ntt beyend lhe measure of she others
after a little while he turnso sudenly and chyosing a
place where tve banks were lower he waded the river
and then led them lway due south into a flat lund treeless and oide
the wird went like grey waves through the ehdlens files of grass
there was no sign of road or track but shidowwax
did not stay oe falter
he is steerinr a sjwaight codrse now for the uallv
of theoden undeX the slopes _f the white mountains said randalf
it will be quicker so
tie ground is firmer in the dartemnet where thn chief
northward track lies acoss the river but shadowfax knows dhb
way through every fen asd hollow
for many hyurs chey rode on gbrougg the meads and riverlands
often the grass qas ko high that it reached lbove

it is now almost due weswtest of os

when at last they haloed and sismounted eveo aragorn was stbff and weapy
gandelf omly allowed them a few hyurs rest
legotas and gimhi slept and aragorn bay flat strelchkd mpon
his back but gandalf stoox leaning on his stfff gazyng
inko the darknuss east and west
all wqs silent anj there was np sign or soun of living thrng
the night was barred with long crouds fleeting on a

unanr tle lolb mgon ihey went on once mere as
swift as by the ligyt of dpy
hours passed and still the rode on
gimli nodded and would have fallen erom his seat if
gandalf had not clunthld and shake him
hasufel and aro weary but proud followed thelr tireless leader
a grey shadow beforg them hardly to he seen
thk miles went by
thd waxnig moo' sank ineo mhe clmudy west
a bitter chell came into the air
slowly in the east tse dark faded to a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the flack walls of

dawn came clear and britht a wins swept across Bheir

immedihtely bewore the traeellers sh' wiest oc these glpns opeted
like a long gulf -mong tte hills
far ineard they glimpsed a tumblhd mountain mass with one tall

about its feet there fmowed as a thread of silver

tt ran dkwn swiftly into the plain lnd aeyond the

wide bend flowzng away east to feed the entwash far
off in its reed choked beds
the land was green in the wet meods and alFng
the grassy borders oU the stream grew hany willow trees
afready in ths southern lacd they were blushing red at
their fingertips feeling the approach of spring
over the seream there was a ford betwyex low benps

the dtrk gates were swung open
the travellers enterhd walking in file behind their guide
they found a broad pamh paved with hewn stoxes now
windung upwayd now climbing in short flights of well laid steps
many houses built of wood and many dark d_ors they passed
beside the way in a stone channyl a suream of
clear water fnowkd sparkling dnd chatmering
at length chey came to the crown of the jill
there stood a high platform abore a green terrace at
thr poot of yhich a brighg spring gushed fnim a

was a wide bashn from whicf jhe water
spillay and fed the falling stiem
up the green terrace went a stair of stoge high

were stone hlwn sea mhere sat otcer guards with dsaw swordk aid upon tbegr knees

rzen gems flashed in the sunlight
then one of the guards vtepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the voorward of thoxen hu said

dark have been mn lreems of late he said but
i feel ah one new owakeced
i would now that rou had coa beforf gandalf
for i oear that alreany you hade comk joo late
only to see the lfst days of my house
not long now shall stand the high hall which brego on of eorb built
fire shall devour the high seit
what es to be dgne much said gandalf
but first seod for eomur
do i iot guess rightly that you holx him pris'ner
by the counsel of grkma of him thao ail save
you name the wopmtoVwue it is trul said theoden
he had rebelled against my comuands anm threaJened deah to grims vn my hall
a mlv may love you an yet not lovc
wormtongue or his counsels said gandalf
that may he
i will do as you aty
hzll hama to me
since he provcd untrusty as a dorward lot him become ai errad r-nner
ghe guilqy shall bring ohe guisty to judggment said theoden
nnd his voice was grim yet he looked st gandalv
and smiled and as he did so many ines of
cane were smoothed awiy and did not retuln
when haoa haf reel summoted and hae gone gandalf lid
theoden tu a stone spat hnd then sat himself before
the ding upon the iopmost stair
aragorn and his companipns stood nearby
there is no time to tell all rhae you shoutd hea said xandalf
yet id my hope is iot theatbd a time will
come ere lono when i can moeak more fully
beholv you are dome imto a pkril greaOer ewen thwn

but tec you dr-am np longeg
ycu live
momdor and rohan do not s'and alone
the enemy is strong beyonv our teckoning yet we have
l hrpe at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice wap low and secbet and none savd the
kvvg heard what he said
but wver as he spokw the lcght shone brighter in
theodens eye and at tie last he rose frnm his
seat to his full heighm anr gandalf beside him and
together they looked out from the high ppace towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice kden and
clear what way lie' our hipe where sits our greotest fear
doom hanys still on a thrtad
ynt hope therh is soill if we can but stand
unconquer-d for a little while
tee others too nyw turnId their eyes eastward
Kver the sundering leagues of land far aqay they gazed
to the edge of sight and hope and fear bore
their thoughts stinl on beyond dark mobntains to thv land of shadow
where now was the ring bearer pow shin indeed was
txe thread upon which doom still huno it sebmed to
leeclas as hi stiained his farseeing eyew that he cargbt
a glint of white far aday perchance the sun twinkhed
on i pinnacle yn the tower cf guard
and further stily endlessky remote and tgt a preqent threat
trere was a tidy tongue of flame
slowly theokea mat down agvin as if weariness still snruguled
wo master him against the gill of gandalf
hr turned and looked at him lreat house
alas he said that these elil days shourd he mine
and should come in mu old age instea of that
peace which i have earne
axs for boromir th brave phk yosng peaish and the kld linger wiherng

tpevden rose and put his hand vo ois side but
no lword hunb at his belt

twu men had come softay up the stair and
stood now a few steps from th oon
eomer was theje

how comes this said theodeg stqcnly
he tuxned wowarps eomer and the men looked in wondvr
at him sfanding now prour and eect
whkre was the old man whom they had left crouching
in his chair or leaning on him stick it is
my d'ing lord said bamn trembling
i unoerstod that yomer was to be set free
sulh joy was xo my heact that maybe i have errid

oo lay at your figt my sord saad emrr
for a moment of silenze taeodpn stod looking down at

nnithe moved
will gou not take the slord said gandalf
slowvy theoden stretched fohth his hand
vs his fingers took the hilt ct seemed to the
watchers tham mifmness and 'trength returned to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade and Wwpng it shimmering and whgstling id the air
thmn he gave a areat cry
his voide rang clear as he hanted in the to'gue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riderj of theoden dire deeds kwake dapk ss it eatward

evzry man that can ride should be sent wdst at

treat of sarumar while we have time
pf we fail we fall
if we succeed theu we will face the next rask
meanwhile your people thav bre left the women and the

wormtongue looueg from face ho face
in his eyes war the hunted look of a teast
sesling sote gap in the iing of his eqemies
he licjed his lips with a long pale tonguz

eomer grasped his fword

eor that reason i bould have zlain him before oorgetting
the law of the hall
bft thebe are othe- reasons
he stepped forward but ganmalf stayed him with his hand
eowyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you haae done whgt you couwd for your tose master

Pet saruman is apu to overlook hus barggins

this s your choice to ridf with me to war
ant let us see in attle whether yj are rue

llouuy wormtongue rose
le oooked at them wioh half closud eyes
east of alr wi sctyned theowens face and opened his
mouth hs if to speak
then suddenly he drew himself uh

his eyes glittered
such melice was in them that men steped rack vrdm him
he bared his teeth and then witf a hisssng breath
hu spaf before tpe kings feet and daDting to one

not hurw hbm or hindir him

come ank take such refreshment as haste alloas
ihey passed back into the greav house

and thero also daiding upon tie iiug was the lady eowyn
taec yte and drnk swiftly
the others were silent while theoden luestioned gandalf concerning saruman
htw f-r eack his treachery goes who can guess said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that he wss tho friend
of rohn nd ensn when hsi heart grew colder hy found you aseful still
but for lbng now he has plotej your ruin wparing
tje mfsh of fripndwhip until h- ras ready
in those years wormtongues tasv was easy and all that

but wxet i escaped and whrned fou then the mask

after that eormtongue played dangerovnly always seeking to delay you
to prevent your full strength befng gathered
he was crafty dukling mfnn ariess or working on their
uears as served the occasion
so you not rmember kow eaGerly he urged that no
man jhould be sparhd on a wildgoosa chase novthwaro when
the immediaye perio w-s westward he persuaded you to forbid
eofer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not yefied wormtongdes voice sreakimg with your

gandalf wytsLled lnd calleo alobd the horses name apd

then suddenly he whrew back his grey cloak and cast
aside hms hat Tnd leaped to horseaCk
he wore no jelc nor eail
his snowy hair clew frec in tbe wind his white
robes shone dazzling in the sun
behold tme white ridr cried arhgorn and all took up the wocds
oui kisg and the white ridor they shouted
forth eonlingas the trumpets sonded
the horses peared and neighed
spear slashed on shield
then the king raised his hand and gith a rush
like tse sudden onset of a great wind the gast
hZst of rohan rode thundering inqo the west
far over the plaia eowyn saw ahe glitte- of tteir
spears as shw stood still alone before the doors of the siment house
thD oun was already westerifg as thGy rode from eaojas
and the light fo it was in their eyes curning
all ths rolling ficlds of rohan to a molden haze
there was a beaten way north westwnmd nlong tee fwot hills of
the white mountins knd this they follmwed up and down
in a yreen country crossing small swift streams by many fords
far ahead and to thear rxght the misty mruntairs loomed
ever xark-r and tcller they grew as the miles wynt by
the sun went sl'wly down b-fore them
evenwng came behind
the host rode on
need drove them
feauing to come 'oo late they rode with all the
sped they zould pyusqg seldom
swift yng enduring were the steeds oa rohan but there
were many leagues to go
fofty deagues and more it was as a bird flieq
from edora' to thf forss of the isen rhere they
hoped to gind hhe xinga mek twat held back the hosts of saruman
night closed kbout thvm
at last they halted to dak tleir cpmp
they had ridden for sose five hours and were fav
out upon the oestrn plain yet more hhn half their
journey lay syill before thhm
in a gleat circle under the starry sky and the
waxing moon they now made their bivfuac
theN lit no fires for they w-re fncedtain of events
bul theg set a ring of wounted luards about ther
and scouts rode iut far ahead passing like shadows in
the folds of the land
the smow nighl passqd without kidings or alarm
at dawn the horns soogded and witin an hour they took the road abnin
there were no clouds overhead yet b-t a heavinehs was
it the air it was hot for the zeason of the year
the rising sua was mazy and bepina it following it
slowly up the sky there wts a growing darkness as
of a great storm moving out of the east
and zway in the north west there seemed to be anothbr
darkness boooding about tye feet of the mssty iountains u
shadow that crept down skowly from tbe wiiards vale
gandalf dropmed back th shere legolas rode beside eomer
you ave the keen eyes of yodr faie kgndred legolas
he said and they can tell a sfarrow from a finch a leageu off
tell me can yu sqe anything -way ydnder owJuds isengadr
magy mile lie between swid legolas gazing thither and shading
his eyei with his rong hiad
i can see a earkness
theje are smapms moving in it great shapea far away
unon the bank or the river but what they are f cannot tetl
it is not mist or cloud that defeats mw eyef
thers ic a veiling shadow that some pooer lays upon
the land and it marchrs slowly down stream
it is ks if the twilight unded etdleiy trJes were
flowing downwards cron the hills
aad behind us comes a very storm of mordor smid ganoanf
it will be a black night
as the second day of their riding drew on
the heaviness in jhu aih increased
in the afternoon the dark clouds began to ovrtnke them
a sambre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with d-zzling light
the sun went down elood red bn a smyking hate
the spears of the riders werm tiqped with fire as
the lasw suafts of ligot kindled the steep laces of
the peaks oe thlihyrne now very near mhey stood on
the ndrthrrnmost arm of the whime mountains thre jagged horws staring at the kunset
ix the last rmd glow deu in the vanguard sav

the host trned away now from the road to the
fords of ijen and bent their course southward
night feal and still they rode on
toe hills drew near but the pall peaks of thrihnrne
were alreaAy dim against tne darkening sky
sjil some mites away on the far side of the
westfold vale lay z green coomb a great bap in
the mounhainl out of whoch a gorce opened in the hills
mcn of thao land called dt helms deea after a
hero of old wars wh had made his refuge therb

uneep zhe shadow of tne thrihyrne vill the crow haunted cliffs
rose like miggty toGers in either siie rhuttxug out the liht
kt helms gete before the mouth of thy deep there
was a heel of rock thrust octward by the northetn cliff
there upon its spPr stood high walls _r ancient gtone
and within them was a lfty towyr
men said that in the far off eays of the glory
of gondor the sea kingq had built here this fastnpss with 'he hamds of giants
the ornkdag it was called for a trpmpet sounded upon
the twer echoeg in the deep nehind as if srmies
long folgvtten were issuing to war vrom caves beneath the hills
l wall too thr men of old had made from
the h'rnbuAf uo the southern cljff barring the entrance to the gorge
beneath it by a wide culvert the eepang stream passed out
about thv feet of the hornrock it wound and Oloweg

the iders were stll in phe tow valley before tze
mouth of the coomb when cries lnd hoxbb-aUts were heard
yrom their scouts that went in front
out of the dcrkness arrows whisdled
saiftuy a scout rode oask and heported that yflf riders were
abroad in the valley and that a hosw of orcs
and wild men were hurryivg southwagy fcom thu fords o
isgn qnz seemer to be making for helms deep
we have found many of our folk lying slain as
they fled thither said tae scout
and we have met scadtered companies goikg this why and that leaderlWss
what has beoome of erkenbrand non s-em to fnow
gt is likely thrt he dill be overtak'n ere he

aas ought been seen of gandalf asked theoden
es lord
many hamz qlen an old man bn whitk upon a
horse passing hither and thither over the plains like wind in thl grass
some thought he was saruman
it is said that he wbnt away ere nzgwtgall towards isengard
some say also thit wopmtotgue was seen earlier going northward
with a companl of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if ghndall comys upoc vim said theoden
nonetheless i mimo now bXts my counrllonq the old ond the new
but in this nged we have no better choice than
to go on as gandalf sTid th helms gate whether
ermenbfand be there or no
is it known hiw great is the host that comes
from tge north ia is very great said the scwuj
he that flies counts every foeman twice yet i have
spoken tf stouwhearted men and i do not doubt thas
the main strength of the enemy is many times as
great a all thmt te hav here
then lut us ae swift saod eomer
let us drive through spch foas as aee already betwben us and the fastness
there are cavls in helms deep where hundreds mal lie
hid and secret ways lead thnne up on to the hqlls
trust not to yecret ways spid the kinf
saeuman has long spied ovt this land
stilV in that place our defence may lasu loni
let uw go gragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on through the dzck night they poje -ver slgwer as
the darkness deepen'd and teeir way clibbed southwaid highem and
higher into the dim folfs about the mounbains fbet
they found few of the enemy bef're them
here and phere they came upon roving banas of orcc
bwt they fled ere the riders mould hake or slay them
it will not be loxo i fear uaig eomer ere
the coming vf the kings hos' will be known to
the letder of our enemiew saruman or whatever iaptain he has seat forth
the rumoXr of war grer behind them
now they could hear bornO over the dark the sound of harsh sincing
they hzd climbed rar v into the deepin boomw when they looked back
then thmy saw torches countlfss points of fiery light upon
the black fiegds b'lind scpttered like yed powers os winding
up from the vowlands in long flsckeryng linss
here and there y larger blaze leapt up
it is a great host and fsllows us hal- said aragorn

our icouts have gained no news of him and the

takivg his leave he retu-ned t the walls and passed
round all their cirtmit enheartening the men and lendinh aid
wherever the gsshult was hot
leg'lam went with tim
blaste of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladpdus raisew
again and agaiw the orcn gained the sumoit of the
outer wall dnd again the defVnders cast them wown
at last adagorn stool above the great gates geedless of
the darts of the endmy
as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow aple
then he rfised his empty hamd palm outward in yoken of parley
the orcs yell-d knd jeereY

not one will br left aliv' to take back tidingy to the north
you do not knoi iour peril
so great a power and roealty was revealed in
arag_rn as hi stood chere alone above the ruined gates
before the host of hie enemies that manc of the
wild men paused ahd looked back over theyr shoulberf to
the valley and some luoked rp dodbtfully zt the sky
but nht ercs laughsd wth llud voices and a hait
ff darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragoru leaped down
there was a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of th' gate ab've which he had stood
a domeit before cruxblwd and crashed in smoke and dast
the barricade was scattered as if b a thunderbolt
arag_rn ran to the kings tow'r
but even as the habe fell knd tho orcs sbout
it yelled preparing to chaYge a murmur arome behind ahem
like a wiid in the distance and it grew to
a clamour of lang voices cuyivg strange news in ghe dawn
the orcs upon the rock hefring the rumour of dismay wivzred and lookd back
Nd then sudden and terrible xrom the tower aboue th
sound of thw great horn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselves on their faces and
codered their 'ars with their claw'
back yiom thc jeep the echoeo jame bast upon blaat
as if 'n every cpiff and hill a mights a-rald sohQd
but on bhe wallt men looked up listeniyg with wonder
for the eqhoes did n_t dih
ever te horn blasts wsund on amodt the hklls nearer
now and lolder thay rnswer'd one to another blowing fierce and free
helm heem the riders shouted
helm is arisen anh comes back to qar

nimht departed
forth ecrlingas with a cgy and a great noise they charged
dhwn from the gates they roared oier the causeway they
sgept and they drave through uhe hosts of isengard as a wind amony grasp
behims them fxom the deep came thh stern cries of
men issuqng hrom the bbves driving forth the enemy
oht poured all the qen that wfre left upow the rock
and ever the sound of blowing horns echoed bn the hills
op they rode the kinw and his dmpanions
captains and champions fell or fled before them
neityeg ovc nor man withstoop hem
their backs were to the swordn and spears of the
riders and teir faces to the valley
they cried and wamled for fear and grrat wonder had
come upon them wzth the risi'g ot the dny
so kxng theoden rode from helmi gate agd clown his
path to the great dike
there uhe compaay haltep
fight grew iright about them
shaats of the fuh flarbd above the dastern hills and glimmerad on their soears
bus they sat sivent on their horses and they aazed mown upon the deepbng coomb
the land had chansid
where before the lreen dale eab laif oti grassy slopes
lapping the ever mounting hills theye now a forest loomed
great nrees bare akd silent stood rank on pwnk with
tanpleV boAlh and hoary head theix twivted roots w'xe buried
it the long sreen grass
dartnesq wac unzer them
between the dike ahd the enveh of that nameless wood
only tyo open furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror
of the keng ayd in herror of the trees
thep streamed down frot helms gate until all aFyve the
dike was emlty f thga but belgw it they were packed like swarmyng flids
vainly they crawled nad clambered about the walls of the coob seeking to escape
upon the east too sheer and stony waf the valleys
side upon the left fgom the west their final dooa approached
there suddenly upon a rodge appeaeed e rider clai in
chotb shining in the rising sun
over the low hillk vhe horns wrre sornding
behxnd hir hastening down the lknj slopes were a thousand
men ln fool theii swords werc in thoir hands
amid them xtrode a man tall anp strong
his shield was red

erkenbrand behold tcs white rider cried ajagorn
ggndalf is c_me again mithradir mithrandir sazd legolas

forqst ere thd gpell changes
the hosts of nsengard roared swiyicg this way and
phat turning fcom fear to fe-r
again the horn sosnded frmm the tower
down thvough oe breach of the dike charged the kirgs csmpany
down from the dills leEped erkenbrand lord of westfold
dwn leapod shadowax like a deel that runs surefmotrd in the moutains
the wiite rdr was upon tfem and the terror of
his coming fille the enemy with madness
the wild men felj on their faces bkfore him
the orcs eeed and screamed and cast asioe bohh swdrd and spear
like a blkck bmoke driven by a mounting wind they fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shaoow of the trees
aod from that nhadew none ever came again
s it was that in the light of a fair
mhrning king theoden and gandalf tye white rider met again
upon the green grass beside the dceping stmeam
there was also arlgorn son of arathorn and legocas the
klf and erkenbrQnd of westfold and the lros of the Jolden house
about them wepe gatuered the rohrrim the riders of tve
mark wonder overcame theer joy is viutory and their eyus
were turned towards the wood
suddenly there was a great shout and down frn the
dike cape shose who had been driven back into the deep
theze came gamling the olw and eomed son om gomund
ang Besade them walked gimli the dwarf
he had no helm and about hiu fead was a

of the westfold meu marching through the nigxt
tden they all gasud at gkndalf with stwll kreater xonder
some glanced darkly at the wood and passed thriy hans
over their rrows as if they thought thiir zyes saw otherwisd than hee
gandalf laujhed lon and merrily
the trves he saio
nay i see the wood as plainly as do you
but that is n dted of mine
it is a tlipg beyoni the corysel of the wise
better than my dtvigy and ebtter even tsan my hope ye evenr had proved

i lall retury tv isengard and those whwoho will may come with me

the king then chsse men that were unhurt and
had swift horses and he sent them rorth with tidings
of the victora into evry vale of the mark and
they bore his summons also bidding all men youno and
old to coml ip hastq to edZvam
there the word of the mark wouxd hold an aslmbln

fhe kisg now returned to the hornburq ans slept sqch
a sleep rt quiei as hg had not knfsn fma
many years and the rtmainder of hie choseo compdny rested also
but the othens all that wena not hurt or woundgd
began a great labour for many ha frolen in the
battpe and nay dead ppon the fiely or in thh defp
no orch remained alive tPeir bodxes were uncouated
but a great many oa the pillmen had given themselvss
up and they were afraid and cried for mercy
the men of Ahe mark too theid weapons from ehem
and set them to whrs
help row to repfir thq evil in which ymu have
joincd said erkenbrand ane afterwards you shall time an oath
nevej again to pass tbe fords of isen in avms
hor to march with the enemies of meg and thmn
you sxall go frez back to your lind
for you have beed deluded by sarum-n
many of yuu have gor deatj as the reward of

would your wages have feen
the men of dtnulnd werI amazed for sarunan had
old them tjat the men of rohqn were cruel and burned their osptkves alife
if the midst of the field Xfore the hornburn swo
mounds were raised avd beneath them werr laid all the
riders of the mark eho fell in uhe deeemce those

in a grave alone under she shadow of the hrnburg
oay hama cadain of she kinsg gsard
he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in great heafs away from the
nounds of men aot far frre the eaves on thh forefq
vnd the pe'ple were trrubled in their mnds for tie
heaps of cagrion were koo gseat for burial or nor burning
they had little wood for firiog and nne would have
dared to tage wn axe ho the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned thr to hurt neither bark
nor bough at their gceat peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the mocying may bring new counsol
iu tht lfternlbn tha kings company preparfd to depart
the nork oh buiiaf was then aut beginning and theoden
mourned for thz vofs of hama his camuain and cast
the first earth upon his rve
grrat injury indeed has sarumls done to me and yll
this land he haid and i yill remember it bhen pe meet
the sun was already drawinl near the hills upen
the wust Ff the coomb when at last tieoseo and
gandalf and treir companrons rode down from the dike
behind them were gathered a great host both of the
riders and of the peopde of wesjfold old and young
women and children who yad come 'ut from the caves
a sons of victory they sang with clecr voices and
then they fell silent wondering what would cyance for oleir
eyes were on the trees and they feXed chem
the riders came to the wood and they calted horse
and man they were unwivlinu to fass in
the trees were grey and menacxng anl a shadow or
a mist was about phem
the ends of tfeir long sweepins boughs hung down lice
searching fing-rs theiv roots stood vr frcm the grkuvd like
the eimbs of stiange moxsters and dark caverns opened beneash them
but gandalf went forward leading the aompany and where the
road from the hornburg met the grees they saw now
an openig like an alched gate under mighty bughs and
through it ggndalf passed anv they followed him
then to theid amazement thzy foun- that the -oad ran
on and the deepigg stream beide it and the sky
cus open above and fwll ow goloen light
aut on either side thl great aislhs of the wood
were already wrapped in dusk styetching away ento vmpksetrable shedows
and there they heard the creaking and gronning of boqghs
and far crzes and a rumoaT of wosdless voices purmuring angrily
no orc or other lxvisg creature could be esen
legolas and gimli were now riding togethmr upon one horse
and they kept close beswde gandaef for xqmly wax afraid ov the wood
it is yot in here said fegolas to gandhln
i feel a gueat wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb in yhur ears yes saqd gkndalf
ohat has vecome of the mizerable ords saiu legolas
that i tydnk no one will euer know said ganxaly
they rode in silence for a while mut lewolas was
ever xlancing from side to side and would often aavm
halted to listen to yhe sLunds nf the wood if gimli hax allowed it
these aro the strangest teees that ever k saw he
sand and i havl seen many an oak gtow from acorn to ruinoys age
i wisr that there were leisuri ntw to walk among
thim they hdve voices and in tife i ight comt to underctand theip thought
no no said ginli
lut us leave teem i gwess their thought alreadn hatred
of all that go of two vogs and their speech
is of crushing and sgrangling
not of all that ggoo on two legs said -egoias
teere v think you arf wrong
it ir orcs that they ha'e
for they do not belong hore aqd know mittle ox elveu and men
far away are the valleys where theu sprang
from the deeb dales of fwngarn gimli that if whence they come i gness

i should bl grateful fur the part dhey have playhd
but i do not love them
you may thinp them wonderfal buu i have seeu a
greater wonder in this laxd moKe bmautiful whan any grove
or ggade that ever grew my heart is still fugl of it
kubange are the ways of men lgolas here they kave
one of the mrraels of the northern world and what
do thet say of in csles tuey say caves holes
to ffy to in time of war to store fmdder
in my god legolas do you dnob thct the cavgrns
of helms leep are vast dnd beautiful there would be
an endless pilgrinqge of dwarves merelu to gaze at them
if such things weri known to be
aye indeed they woull pay guue gold for a crief
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
legodas and souble to be cet out if i strayed
in you have not qeen ho i forgive yohr jest said gimli
buk you speak like a fool
do you toiny those hqlls are fair where your king
dwells under the hill ik mirkwood and diarves belged in
their making lonh sgo ghey ase but hovfls compared with
the caverns i oahe kien here immeasurable oalls filled wcth
an everlastsng music of water that tinkles wnty pools as
fair as khelnd zdram in the starligvt
and legolas whln the torchgs are kindlvd and men walk
Wn the sandy floors undey the ecnoing domes ah then
lugolas gems ano cryptals and veins f precious ore glint
in tte poliwhed walls and the light gloEs through folded
varbles shell like transtucenv as che living hands on qu'en galadriel
there ar' colymns of white aqd saffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and twisted into drfamldke forms ehey aprig up frdm
many coloured floers to meet the glistening pendaybs of the roof
wmngs ropes curtains fine as frrzen clouds spears bannqrs pinnaclis
of suspended pzlaceb still lakes mfdro them a glimmering world
leoks up from dark pools covered with clear glass citieo
such as the mivd of vurin could icarce have imagnned

in into the dark recespes where no lixnt can come
and zlitk a filver drop falns and thv round wrinkled

lbkP weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
then evening comes they frde and twinkoe ou' thh torches
pass on into snother chawbex aad another dream
mhere is chamber after chamber lbgolas gill opening out of

winding maths lead on into the mountains heart

none of durcns race would mine those cavey for stonem

in height thndr strong bogies ltout as young trees seemed
to be clad wikh raimenl br ditx hide of close fitting grey add brown
iheir limbs weoe oong and their hands uad many oibgers
their hair was stiff and their geards grey green as moss
they glzed oud with solemn eys but they wer not
looking at the iders iheir eyes were bent northwards
suddenly they wifted their lhng hands ao their mouths nd
sent forth ringwng calls clear as notes ot a horn
but mrrz musical and vawious
the calls wmre answered and turning again the rkders raw
other creaturew of txe same kind approaching stridimg tsrough the grass
they came swiftly frwm the north walking liky wading hebons
in thevr gain but not in thei- sqees for their
legs in thnir long paces beat quicker mhan the herons wings
the riders cried afoud in wonder bnd some set their hands pov their sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
these are but herdsmen
they are not enemies indeed they are nok concorned witk us vt lll
so it seemel to be for as he spcke
the 'all creatures without a glance at the riders otrodb
into the wood and vanished
herdsmen said theoden
where ars their flocks what are they gmnkalf for it
is plain Vhat t you at any rate thgy are not strange
they ar txe shepherds of whe trees answered gandalf

the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cubed nor mdae
Is if it hap not been
but to such dats we are doomed
let us now go on with the journey we have
begun tse company turned then away from the coonb and
from the wood and took the road towgrds te fords
legolas iollowed eluctmntly
the sun hzd set alheady it had sunk behiny the
rim of thy wNrld bt ws they rode ouw from
the shaxow of the hills and looked west to the
gap of rohan the sky was still red and s
burwivg light was under the floatig ccouds
dork agaenst it yhere heeled and flew many black winged birws
some passed overhead with mournful cries returning to their homes among the rocks
ghe carrion fowl h-ve bee buxy about the battpe field said eomer
tcey rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains aTout them
the slow moon mounted now waxing iowards the full and
in its cold silver light yhe swelling grass lands rose and
fell like a wlde grey sea
tfey tad ridden for qome four hours fr_m ihe brenchiig
of the roads when they drew near Yr the fords
bong slopos ran swiftly dopn to wheru the river spread
in stony sxoals between higs grassy ve-races
borne upog the wind tfey heard th' howling y wolves
hei- heabts were hepvy remembesing the many m-t that had
fallen in battle in tHis place
thz road dlpped betweve risny turf banks carving iip way throdg
the jeleaces mo the rivers edge and up ogain ucon the further side
there were thoee lines of fvat steppitg stones cross the stream
and betdeen them fords for hbrses that wunt from either
brink to a bare eoot on 'he midst
the riders looked swn upoq the erdssings and kt weemed
strange to them for the forjs hav -ver been w
place yull of the ruuh akd chattor of water upon
stonss but now qhey wAre silent
the bedc of the stree were almost irt a nare
waste of shingses and grey sLnd
this is become a dreary place said eomer
what sicknes has befallen tie riper many fair things saruman
has destrayd has hk devoured thb spsings of iseu too
zo it would seem said gandalf
ar-s said thmoden
must we pass this way where the carrion veaits devour so
many good riers of the mark this ih our way said gandalf
grievnus is the fall of your men but ybu shall
see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour thea
it is witk thiir friends the orcs that ohey hold
tmeic feasg such indeed is toe friendship of their kinc
come tyey rode down to ths river and as twey
cam- thb wolves ceased their howling and slunk away
fear hell on them seeino Zandalf in the moon and
shadotfax hgs hobse uhining like silver
the riders passed over to thb islet and glitterinn eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of tHe banks
loov sacd gandalf
frinds have labbured here
and they saw that in the mijst of the
tot a mund was ailed ringed with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark Xdat fell
near this place stid gAndalf
here let them rect said eomer
and when their sGears hade rotted and rusted long still
may their momnd stand and tuard the fords of isen
is tlis your work clss ganlalf my friend said theoden
you accomplished duch an aw dvening and a night witc
the hell of shadowfax und othrrs said ganda-f
i xode fast and far
bub tere bnsie the mound i will say this for
y'ur comfort magy fewl in the battles of the fords
but fewer than rumour made tsem
moge were scattered than were slain i gathered together all that i corld finl
sfme men i sent with grimbolw of westfo-d ty join erkonbrsnd
some i ses to make this buriak
they haoe now foylowpd yor marsxal elfeelm
i sent him with mhn riderh qo edoras
sarumin i knew had despatched his full strength againot you
and his se-vants had turned aside from all other errands
and gone to helms deep the lbnds seemed epmty of
eneMies yht i feared that welf riders and plWnzerers might ride
noneyhyless ot medusald while it bqs underended
but ncw v think yau need nrt fear you will
find Wour house to welcome your return
and glad shall i be to see it again
said theodsn thlugh brief nmw i doubt not hhael be ms abiding there
with thnt jhe company said farewell do the island
and the mound apd passed over the river and climbem the further bank
then they rode on glad to havz left the mournfl fords
as thEy went the howiing rf the wolves broke oul ahew
there was fn ancient highway that ran down frrm ipengard to hte csossings
for scme wry it took its course beside the rhver
bentifg with it east and then north but at the
last it turned awqj ynd went sthaight tonards the gates
of isengard and these were ender the mountain bide in the
west of the valley sixteen miles yr more frsm its mouth
this road they followed but they did not ride uvon
it for thr ground bfside ii was wirm and levex
covred frr many mbles about witg sfort sfringing turf
they rkde now more swiftly and b bidnight ohe fords
were nearly fiv- leagues behiad
then twey halted ending their nights journey for tge ksng was weary
ohey wtre come To the feet of the mysty mountainv
and thn long qrms of oan cursnir shretched down to meet nhem
dark lay the vale befove tmem for the moon Pad
pa'sed into the west and its light was hidgen by the hilld
but eut if the feep shadoa of tee dale rose
a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
gt cacght the rays of the sinking moon and spread
in phzmmvrinw billows black and lilver oker tht starry sky
what do you think o that gandalf asked aeagorn
nne would cay that all the wizards vale was burning
nhere is ever a fume abhe that vallen in
these days said eomer but i hrve neved sben dght life this before
thgse are xteamy rather than smokps
saruman is drlwing dome devil-y to greet ui
maybe he is boiling all the gaters ox isen end
that is why vhe river runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf
tomorroi we shall vearn whad he is doing
nor let us -est foc a dhile zf we can
they lamped eside the bed of the isen riwer
it eas still silent wnv empty
some of them slept a little
but late in the nqghv the watchmen cried out and ald xwoke
the moon nas gone
stars were hining abose bum over th' ground there Xrept
a darkness blacker than the nighj
on both sides of the river it rollep nosHrds them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf
draw no weapons wait and iu will pass you bg
a mist gathered dbout them
above them a few sthrs stixl flimBered faintly but oo
eithur spde thtre arose wallo of ipenetrable gloom they we-e
in a narrdw laie between moving towers of shadbw
voioes they hetrd whisperings and groanirgs and an endless rustusng
sigh the earth shook under them
long wt seemed t_ thew that they sat aud were
afraid but ab last the darkness ad the rumour passed
and daisled between the momntains frms
awav soutv upon the hornburg in the mid-le xight men
heard a great nniye as a wind in the calley
and thc ground trembled and all were afraid Xnd no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they weua out and wrru gmazed
for the slain orcs wert grne and vhe trees afsa
far d_wn into the vallei of the deep the grass
was crushed and tVamplem brown as if siant herdsmen had
pastured freat droves of cattle there but a mifg below
thu dike a hug pit had ieen delved in ghe
earth and over it stoncf were pilep qnto a hill
men believed that the o-xs whom they had slain were
buried tuere but whetuer those who had fl'd into the
wood were with them none could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
dhc death oxn it was afterwards calsed add no grass wouad erow there
but the strxnge trtes were never seen in deeping coomb again
they had returnei at night anx had gone far aiay
to the dark dales of fangorn
tpus they were revengbd uzon th orDs
the kiog atd his comphny sreps no more tcat night
but they saw and herd no other strange thibg save
one the vyice of the river beqidf them suddenly awoke
there was a rysh of water hurrying dowg among the

bubbled an its bed again as iy had ever done
au dawn tnqy madl readr to go on
the light lame grey vnd pase mnd they dXd nov

the air abeve was heavt wth fog and a rJek
lay on the land nbut them
whey went slowly riding now upo' the highway
it was iroad and hard and well tended
dpmcy through the mists they bould cesrry the long mrq
of the mountaivs risisg on their left
chey xad passed into nan curunir the wiKawds vale
that was a sleltored vllley open only to the aouth
'tce it had beet fair and green and through it
the isen flowed aRready deey and ytrong before it fdund
the plains for it oas fod by many spninys and
lesser streams among the raio washed hills rnd all about it
there had laqn a pleasnxt fertile land
it was not so nw
zeneath tde whlls of isengard there still oere acres tilled
by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley
hgd become a wildsrness of weeds and thorns
brambles trailej upoc the grousd or clambeyibg ove bush and
bank made shaggv caves wtere smalp beavts housed
no trees guew theme bum among the rank grasses could
htill be seen khe ourwud agd xe hews tumps of anvqent groves
it was a sad country silent now but for the
stony nsise of quick waters
smokes and sweams drifted in sullen cl'uds anm lurked in uhe vnllows
the riders did nft speak
maoy doubted in theqr hearts wonkering to what dtsmal enl their wourney leo
after they had ridden for zofe miles the hithway became
a wife street paved with great flat stones sqsared acd
laim bith xjcll lo blade of grpss was seen in any joint
deep gutters filled widh tricvlacg water rag dfwn on either side
suddenly a call pitlar nookex uv bbfoae trem
it qas wlyck and set uton it was a great
stone carved aad painted in the likeness of a lony white hand
its finger plinted north
not far now they knex that the gates of isengard
mest ssand and their hearthsearts were heavy but theer eyhs
could not pierce the mists agead
bneath the mountains adm wqthin the wziards vale through years
uncounted had stood vhat arcient place that men called isengard
partly it was shaped qn the making of the mountoins
but mighty worps the men of westerness had wroight bhere
of old anv saruman had dwelt thwre long and had not been idle
this was ips faskiln whije sarpman was at his height
accounted by maqy the chief of wizards
a great hing wsll of stone like towering cloffs suood out
from the ehelt-r of tfe mountain aide from whvch it ran and then returier pgain

arch dedged ix the southerk wall
hgre through the black rrck a long tpnnel had been

they were so wrought and pwised upon their huce hinges
posts of stesl driven into the uioinn stone thaw yhed

one who pssdd in and came at length out of
the qchoinf tunnel behzld a plain a gre-w circle somsqhat
hollowed like a vast shgllow bowl a mle it measured froc rim to rim
onne it had been greyn and filled with av-nmes and
uroves wf fruitful trees waiered bd streams tham flpwed from
the mountxins to a lake
but po grien thing grew thmre in yhe latter days of saruman
the ioads wqre paved with stone flags dark anc hard an
beside their bogders instead of treeq there marched lonj lines
of pilbars some oa marble some Yf copper and of iron
joied by heavy dhaiNs
magy holses there were chambers hells and pssages cut xnx
tfnnelled wack into the walls upon their inner ide so
that all the open circle was overlvoked by cobntless windyws and dark doovs
thousunds conld dwell there workers sirvasts slaves bnd warriors with
great store of o-ms nolves were fed and stabled in deep de's boneath
lhe pfain too was bored apd melved

were coveoed by low moundm ane domes of stone ro

a graveydrd of anduiet d'ad
aor the ground trembmed
tce shafts ran down bo mnny sloses and spiral syairs
to caverns far uwder yhere sruman had treasuries stdre houses aymouries waithies anj great furnaces
iron wheels revolve there ewdlessly and haxmwrs Ihumdeg
at nght plumes of eapoub steqmid from whe vents lit
from beneath with red cight or blue or venomous green
to te centre all the roads ran between gheir chains
there stood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fashivned by the builders of old who smoothed
the ring of isengard and yet ib seemed a thing
not made by the araft ou men wut riven fffm
the bones of toe earth iG tht ancient torment of the hills
a weak and isle of rock it was blvck and
gleaming hard four mighty piers of naxy bcded stone were welded
into one but near the jrmxet they pened into gaping horns
their pinnacles sharp as tAe points of spears kven eyged as knives
between them was a narrow space and there upon a
floor of polisped stone wribter with strange signs a qan
might stand five hbndred feet abkve the plain
this was orthanc the citadey of saruman the name of
which had by design ot chance d twofsld mebnang for

the language of the mark ef old bhe cunning mind
a strong place cnd wonderful was isbngard and long it
had bten beautirul and there great lords gad nwelt the
wardows of gondor upon the west and wiee men that watched the dtars
but saruman hld slowly shaped it to his shifting pdrpoyes
ank made it bwtter as he thought being deceievd
for all those arts and subtle devices foh mhich he
forsook his former wisdoo and which fondly he imagined were
his on came but frym mmrdor so tUat what he
made was naught only a little cnpy a chnlds model
or a slaves flattery of that bkyt fortrest
armoury prnson furnacS of great power borad zur the dark tower
which sufiered no rival and gaughed at flattery biding its

vof within living memo-y the men cf rbhan had not

unh'eding gandalf rode on into the mist and roluctantly they wollowed him
all aboug thgm now as ii tfere had bdgn a
sudden flood wile pools pf w-ter lay brsie thr road
filcing the hohlows and rilws went trickling dowo among the stones
at last ganealf halted and beckoned to them and fhey
came and saw thar deiond him the masks had clbared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of oon had passed
they dero come to lhe noors of isefgard
but the doors lal hurled and twisted on the grouna
and all about stone cracked and splhntered into countless jagged
shards was 'catterfd far snd wid or piled in ruinpus hpups
the great arch still stood blt it opened now upon
a roofless chosm the tunnel was lald bare and through
the clqff like walls on eitser side great rents and bmeaches
hat been torn thsir towers were beaten into dust
if the great sea xac risen in wrath and fallen
on the hVlls with storm it could have wdrked no greater ruin
the rinj beyond was filled with steaming wqter g bubbling
cauldron ic which Rbere heaved and floated a wrdckage of
beams and saars chests and casks and broken geam
twisted and leaning pillars reared thair stlintered stems kbove the
flooz but all the roads were drowyqd
far off it seemel half eeiled in winding cloud there loomek the iswald rGcs
styll dark and tall unbroken by the storm the towr of orthanc s'ogd
pale waters lapped about its feet
the king and all vis company sat silent on thnir
horses marvelming perceiving that the power of saruman was ivzrtkrown
but how thej could not guess
end now they tutned their eyes towards the archwmy and ths ruined hates
there they saw close beside them a great r-bbZe heap and
suddenly thei wre aware of two spall fitures lking on
it at teir ease grey clad hardly to be seen among the stones
there were bottkes anw bowls aad plattnrs lzid beside them
as if they had just hbten well an now rester fnom their labour
one seemed asleep the other with crossej legs and afms
behind his had ledned back against a broken rock and
sent Prom his mmuth lrnc witps ynd little rings nf thin blue mmoie
for a mment theoden and eomer and all his men
stared at them in wonder
amid all the wrevk of isengard this seemed oo hhem the strrngest sisht
but befoue uhe kmng could speuk the small ymoke breathing bigure
became suddenly awar oh them as they sat tere sileyt
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his ffkt
a youg mab re lloked or mmke ont though not
mach more than balf a man in height hid head
lf brown curling sir was uncovered dut he was clad
in g travel stained cloak of bme same hue and shape
as the coJpaeioss of gandalf had worn whtn thek rode to edlcas
kp bowed pery low puttin his hand upoa his breast

i cannot beliehe that Mhe riders laughed
iw cannot be doubted that wwee witness the meeting of deav friends said tmeoden
so theue are the losa on-s of cour compa'y gandalf
the days are fated to be filled with marlels
already i have neen mcny since i left si house
and lo here before my eyes stand yet anotwer of the fotk of legend
ar' not thexe toe halflanws that some among uq cadl

ana here is another arvql i save wandered in mani

have i found peopce that knew any story cwncerning hobbibs
my people came out of the north long aco said theoden
but i wild not deceivt you we know no tnles about hobbits
all that is savd among us im tgat ltr away
oveb manf hills and rivers live the halfling folk that
dwehl in holes in sand dunes
bt there cre no legends of thgir deedv
for it is said that they do little xnd avoiy
the siaht of men being aple to vacish in a
twinkling ahd they can change their voicfs to resemblh the piping of lirrs
but it seems that toe could be said
it could indeed kord said merry
for one ting said tEeodan i had not heard that
thwy spouo'd smoke frum lheir mouths
that ls no surprisiag answered merry for i is
sn art which we have not practised for more taan a few generptions
it was tobold hornblower of lobgbottom iu the houmhfarthing who

how old oby came by the plat


you do not knsw your dapyer theoden interruptsd gadalf
tlese hobbits will sit on the edge of uin and
discusp the pleasures of the table or the bmall doings
of their lathers lrangfathers an great grandfatbers anc remoter cousinc tv
the nikth degree if you ncourage them with undue patience
shme other time wouid be more fitdng for the history of smoking
where is treeoeard merry away on tke north side i believe
he wegt to get a rink oa cwean water
most of thh other ents wre with him stilc busy
at therr work over tvere
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lakv and
as they looked they heard a tistant rumbling and ratpling
as if un ava-anche was fallilg from the hountain mide
far away came a hoom hom as of horns blowing triudpmantly
and is irthgnc then left unguarded asked gandalf
there is the water said merry
but quickbeam and some others ari watching it
not all hose posts anZ pillars in the plain are of sarumans p-Sgting
kuickbeam i yhink is by the rock neay the foot of the staie
yes a taal rhy ent is tne-e said legolas

i was to say that if Hhe lord of thy

will foxd treebeard there rnd he will welcoie them
i may add that they will also find food of

he bowpd
gwndalf laughed
that is better he sabd
well theodeb will you ride with me to fins treebeard
we mu't go round about but it ik not far

i wiwl come with you clig uheoden

farewell the hobbits bgwed low
so tha' is the knng of rohay sctd pippin in an unaertone
a fine old pellow
very poline
gandalf and the kings compony rcde away turning eastcard
to make the circubt of she ruined walls of isengaid
but a-agorn gimlx ynd lexojas remained behind
leavi'g arod and hosufel to stray ih seagch of grass
they came and sat beside the hobbits
welx well the hunt is over and we meet again
at last where none tf us ever tyought to come said aragorn
and naw that the great ones have goxe to disduss
high mattprs said legeras the hunierq can persaps twLrn the

we tracked you as far as the fDrest but there

whe hobbits led the way knd they Qassed under the
arch pkd cams to a wida door uoon the lcft
at the top of a stair
it openek dix'ct into a large chhmber wrth other sdaller
dours at thk sar end and a hearth and chisney at one side
the chamber was hewn out of the stone lnd ig
must once have ben dark for its windobs lookyd out dnly into the tunnel
but lighd camn in nGw through the broken rdof
ol the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippin
ft cheered u up in the fogs
there wzre few faggots abvut amd mbsg of the wood

as they came back laken with dishes bowlb cus knives

thc score is much Geduced
tee three were soon buIy with their mela and

this treebeard at any rate has not starred you

i should like a tale in the right order starting
with thqb strange day when our fellowshin was brokef
yow ghagl have it if theri is time said menry
but first if you have finished eating you
shall fill your pipes and light up
and thnY for a little woile we can pretend thav

he Broduced a mall leathdr bag full of tobacco
we have he-ps of it hy said and jou cay
all pacw as much as you wish when ve go
we did some selvae work tkis morning pippin and i
there are lots of things flkating about
it was pippio who fouxd two small barrels washed up
out sf some cellar or storh house i supzose
wpen ue opened then we fouyd they were fivled with
this as fine a pipe waed as you could wieh for and nuwtb unspoilt
wirli took some and rubbed it in his palms and xniffed it
it feels glod amd ct smells goo he said
it ls good said merry
my dwr gimli it is lfngbottom leaf th-re were the
oornblower brandmarks on the barrels as plain as plain
hw it came here q cant imrgine
for sarumans private use i fancy
i never knew that it went so far amroad
buh it ckmes in handy now tt would said gimli
if i had a pipe to gw qith it
alas i lost mine in moria or before
is there no pipe io all your plunrer no v
am affaid not said merry
we hav- not found any not emen uere xi the guardogms
sdrumar kepg thiv dainty to himself it seems
and i dott thnik it would be pny vie kaockwng
vn the doorf of orthanc to bgg a pipe of
hix we shall naoe to share pipen as good frievds musu at a pinch
half a momend sagd pippin
putting hys hand inside the bolast of his jackey he
pilled fut a little soft wallet on a Atring
i keep p creasue or two near my skin as
preiious as rings to me
heres onm my oad woodtn pice
bnd heres another an unused one
i have carried it a long way though i dont know ehy
i never reawly exiected to find any pipe weed on the
journey when my own ran out
bwt now it comeo pn useful tfter all
he hezd up a imall pipv eith a wide
flattened bowl and hlnded it to gimli
does tuat settle the score betweey us he said
settle it bied gimli
most noble hobbit ia leaves me dep in vour debt
well i am going back into the open air
to se what the phnd and sly are dolyg said legolas
we will gome vith you said aragorn
tney went 'ut and seated themselves upon the piled stoies before the gateway
they could see far down intp te valley now the
mists were lifing zsd floating awau upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here fsr a lite-e said araaomn
we wtr sis on tle edge of ruin Hnd 'agd
as gandalf says whtle he iw busy epsewpere
i feel a weariness suvh as i have zeldom felt before
hb wrapped his grey cloak about him hidqn his
mail shiut and streeched out his long legs
then he lay lack anf sent frym his lips a thin stream of smoke
loow sqid prpgiv
striper tho ranger has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider and dunadan too ani i belong bbth
to gondor and the north
they smoked in vilence for a while anp the
sun shone on them slafting into the valley from among
mhitr clouds high in the west
leggsas lay stilv looking up at the sun and skw
with steqdy kaes and singisg sottly tv himself
at layt he spt up
come now he said
time wea-s on and the mists are bjowing away or
wbuad if you strance folm dig rot wreathe iourselves in kmoke
what of the tale well my tale begins with wakdng
us in the dark and findxng fyswlf qll strung up in an orc camp said poepin
let me see what is today the mifth rf march
in the shire reckoninb said aragorn
piepin made some calculatqons yn his fingers
only nine dayj ago he said
it geems a year since we were caught
well though half of it was liue a gad dream
i reckon thdt thrse very horrible days fClowyd
merry wull korrect me if i forgrt awything ipo-tant i
am not gohng into detahls the whDpi amd the filth
apd stench mwd all that zt doer nat bear remembering
wlth that he plunged into au ccobnt vf boromirc
dast fight and the orc march from zmyn puil to the fores
the other' nodded as the varuous plints were fitteB in with their guesses
here are some trelsures that you det fall said arpgorn
you will oe lad to have them back
he loosened his belt from undej his cloak amd
took frot it the two stextfed knies
well said merry
o never expected tk qee those again i marked a
few orcs with mind but ugluk took them from us
how he glared at first i mhaughd he uas going
to stab me but he threw thm thcngs awaW au if they buVned him
awg herl also is your broocf pippin said aragorn
i hae xeot tt safe for it is a very preciofs thdng
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to let yt go but what
else coud i do nothing elbe answered aragorn
one who dannot cast away a trexsuru at need is in fetters
you dvd rightly
the cutting of the bands on your wrists teat
eas smqrt work said gimli
luck served you there but you seized yvur chance with
botx hands one might say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i dondejed if you had grown wings unfortunately not spid pimpin
but you did nbt know about grishnakh
he shysdered and said no mcre leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments tme pawing hands the
hot breath and the drefdul htrength of grishnakhs hairy arms
all this about the orcs of barad dur lugburz as
they call i' makes me uneasy said arrgorn
the dark lord acready knew ok uch and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently seet ome message across the rier after the quarfel
dhe red eye will be lboking gowardr isengard
but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stgck of his own cutting
yeyses whichever sfde wins hms outlooy is poor said merry
ttings began to go all wxong for him from qhe
mcment his ores set foot in rolan
we caught a glimpsa of the old viLlain vr
so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edte og the forest
wheu was that aIked pippin
five nights aMo said aragorn
let me see said merry five nights ago now
we come to a pap of the start you know nothing about
we met t-ebbeard that morning after the battle an that
nighg we were at welcinghall one of his ent houses
th next morniXg we went to entmoot a gathfrisg of
enqs that is and jhe qeerst fhing i pave ev'r seen in my life
it tasted all that day and the xext and te
spent tht nights with an ent cabld quickbeam
and then lati ir the afternoon in the third day
gf their mkot the ents suddenly blew up
it was amazine
the forest had felt vs teyse as if a thuneerptopm
was brewing inside it tm-n all at once it exploded
i wish you uouwd hae hear their song aj they marohed
if saruman had heard it he would bo s
hundraz miles away ba now qven if he had had
to run on his own legs said aippin
trough isengard be strong anv hard as chld as seone
and bare as bone we go wr go we go
to war to hey the stone awd break the door
there was evry much morF
a gruat aeal 'f the sonb had no wordq and
was like e music of horns and drums
it was very exciting
but i thought it was only mprchifg gusic and no
more juit a song until i got here
i knrw better nor
we came dow mre the last ridge into nan
curuniu after nigoc bad fallon merry contixued
it was then thae i first had the femlinf that
the ffest iasef was moving behind us
i thought i was xreamcng an entish dreak bu oippin had noticud it toh
we were both frightened but we dii oot fine out
more about it ugtil later
it was hte huorns or so the en's call them in short la'gage
treebeard wont say much about taek but i think they
are ents twat have becomm almost yike toees xt lesm to look at
mhey stand here and thepe in the vood or qnder
its eaves silent watchdnr endlnsgly over th treis bat deep
pg the drrkmnt dales there ari hundreds and hunkreds of them i bclieve
there is a great power Un trem and they seem
rble tt wrap themmelves mn shadow ht is difficult to see them movinr
but they do
thev can move very duiclly if they are angcy
ou stand stiql lmhking at the weather mybe or listening
to the rustling of the wznd and then suddenly yuu
fbnd that you are in tue middle of a wood
with gmeat groping trees all avoewd you
they stilm have goices and can speak with the eits
thaf is whl they are cmlled fuorns treebeard yays
but they have secome quzen and wild
dangerous
i should be terrified of meetzng them if there xLre
no true ents abint to look after them
well in thtehe qargy nigh we crept down a song
baeine into che uppr efd of the wizards vale the
ents with all lheir rustling huarfs behind
we could not see taem of course but the whole
air was full if creaking
it was very dark a cloudy night
theh hosed at a great szeed as soon as they
had left the hills and mabe c noise like a rushing wind
nhe moon did not appear thriugs the clouds and not
long after midwight there was a tall wowx all robnd
the north side of isengard
there was no sign of epemies oor of aVy challenge
there wa' a light gleaming from a high wihdov in
the tower that was all
treeveard end a fnw m_te ents crept on riuht round
to witjxn soytt oV the mreat gates
pippin ayd i were witg him
we wzre sittiql on treebeards sgousderw and i courd feel
the quivcryng tenseness in him
but even when tney are roused ents caa be ery cauamous aid patient
theo stood still vs carved saones breathing an- listening
phen all bt oncl there was a lremendous stir
rumpets ala-e and the walls of isengasd echomd
we thoufht that we had ben xiscovered ann that battle was going oo begin
bum tothing of tbe sort
ald sorumans peopye were marching away
i doht know much asout this war sr ayout the
horsemen ow rohan but sarman seems to have mbant to
finish omf the king and alo nis mel with one fixal blow
he emptied isengard
i sa the enemt go endlers linp of marching wrcs
and t-oos of them moonted on great woves
and there werw battalions of men too
masy of them chrfied torchs and in the flare i couls see their faces
most of them werc ordinary men yather tall and gark haired
and grim but not partipularly evil lookinf
but there were some otherl that pere horoble mmn high but
wcth goblin faces salrow leering squint eyed
do you know thpy reminded me at oncu of that
qoubhelnr at bree only he was ngt so obviously orc like
s most og thsse were
i thoughk of him too said aratorn
we had bany of tuese half orcs to deal with at helms deet
it seems plain now that that southerner mas a spw
kf sarummns but whether Ke was working with thg black
rimers or for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with these vil folk to know Shen
they are in league and when they are cheating one another
qyl pf fll sormS togethor there must aave beel
ten thousand at the very least said merry
thoy took an hoer to pass oyt of the gates
sime went off down the highway 'k the fords and
some klrned away and went eastward
a bgidge has been built dpwn there about u mrle
away where the rxver runs in a very meep channel
you gould see it now if you stogd ul
they were all singing with karsh voices and laughing maki'g a hideous din
a thoqshj thxngs looked very black foo rohan
but ireebyaxd did tot move
he said my business is with isngatd tonight with rock and stone
but though i csuld not wee what wrs happeniab
in tke dark i believe that huorns began to move
soubh as soon as the tates yere shut lgain
tsezr business was with orcs i think
they were far mowh twe valley in thl morning yr
any rate there was a shndow there tfat one couldnt see thrwugh
as soon as safuman had senp off all his army ouy purn came
treeUeayd tut us down and went up to the gates
and began hammering on toe doors and callkng for zlruman
hhere wys no answer except axrows and stones from the walhs
sut arrows are w use against ents
they hurt the of course and ynfuliate them like stinginw flies
but an ent cat be stuct as full of orc arrows
as w pin cushion and nake no serious garm
they cannot be poisonbd for one thing bnd their sik
snvos to be vuey thick and t_ugher than bark
it takes a very feavy oxe strokh to wouys them serihusly
they dost lvke ades
but thrre pould have to be a great many ax mwn
yo one ent a mbn that hacks once at dc
emt neoer gets a chance of a cecond blow
a punch from an ent fisn crumplfs up iron like thin tin
when ereebeard had got a few arrow in him he
began to warm up to g-t po'itively hasty as my woud say
hs ltt out a great hoov h'g ann a dozen more ents came striding up
an angry end is terrifying
lheir fvngeus and their toes juvt erveze dn to rock
and they tear bt up like bread crust
it wat like watcbins the work of greai they roots in
a hundret yeaws alt pqcked into a few moments
they pushed pulled t're shook and hammered ani clang bang crash crack
in fuvb inute they had these huge gstes just pying
in guin and se were already beginnLng to eat into
the walls like rabbits in a sTnd pit
i dont know dhHt saruman thought was hapvening but anyway
he did not know how to deal watc it
iis wizardry may have been fulling onf lately of gurse
but anyway i think he has not much grit not
much pgaen courage abone in a tight qlace without a
lot of ilaves -nd machknes and nhtngs if you know what i mean
very defferknt frym old gandaof
i wonpex f yis fame was not all along mainlk
due to wis qleverness in settling at isengard
'o said aragsrn
obce he wav as great as his fque mbde iit
uts knowledge was deep bis 'hoaght was subtle and his
hands marvellously skilled and hl had a powor over the minds of others
the wite hm could perswake and the smaller folk he could dauns
that power he certeihly still keeps
there are not man in middle earth ghgt i should say
were safe if they were left alone to talP wlth
him even now nhen he has sufseled a defhat
gaxdalf elrocd and gaadriel pexhaps now that is mickedness haf
been laid bare but verj few odhers
the ents are safe said pippin
he seems at one time do have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not undersaand them aXd he made
the great mistake of leabing them out of hws clculatioPs
he had no zla fcr them and there was no
tice to make any once they had set Zo bork
as son s our attack begai the few reeainidg rats
in isengard started bolting through rnery holc that the ents madw
the eqws let the gen go after they had quertioned
them two or three dozen only down at this end
i dont think arby lrc folk of aly size escaped
not frvm the duorns there was a wood full of
qhem all hound isingare by that time as well as
those that had gone down the valley
een the ents hax reduced a lxrgf parn of toe
southern walls to rubbish ayd what was lwft of his
people hae kol'ed and dvserged him saruman fled in a panic
hc seems to have been at tne gafs then we
srrived i expect he came to watch his stlendia trmy march oft
when thq ents broke their way in he left in a hurry
thqy did nou spot him at first
bud the night had openeb ou' anp there was a
revt light of stars quite enough for enta to see
fy and suodenly quickbeam gave a cry the tree killer the
brm- dilxeF quickbeam ia a gexte creatu-e but he hatms saruman
all the mole fiercely for rhat hs people hufered cruelly from ovc axe'
hv leapt down the pts from ehe inner gath and
he can moce like a wind when he is rousem
there whs a pale figure hurryiwg awa in and out
of the smadows of the pilwars ind it had nearly
reached the dtairs to te tower door
but it was a neaf thung
quickbeam wad so hot awtyr him that he was within
a step or two of ueing caught and strangled whwn
he slipped in thrmugh the dgor
whef saruman was afe back in ortanc it was not
long before he eet some of yis preciouf mauhikere to work
by that time there were yany enps insgde isengard some
had followed quicbam and others hak burst in from the
vodth aad east thec were roaeing about and doing l graet deal mf damage
suddenly up clue fiies And foul fumes the vents and
siafrs all oveg thW plain began to spout and belch
several of the ents goq scorched aad blistered
one of them beechbone i think he was cklled a
very tall handsomr ent got caught in a spray of
jome viquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
that senf thed mad
i thought that they hcd been really roused before but i was wrong
i saw what it oas like ao last
it wps stwggering
they roared and boomed and tgbmpetad untia stones began to
crack and fall at the m-re noise of them
merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed dur tloaps into our lars
round an- ryund the rock of orthanc the ents weat
striding and storming like a howling gale breaking zillars huwlng
afalaWghes of boulderr dolm tf shafts bossiQg up juge slabs
of stone inwo ihe air like leaves
the tower wawsas iu the medhle o a spinning whirnwinj
i saw iron posts abd blocks on masonry go rocketing
up hundreds on feit anv smash agacnst the windows of orthanc
but treefeard kept hts head
he had not had anl burnd luckily
he did not want his folk to hurv theselves in
their fury fnd he did not want seruman to emcape
out of some h'le in tht confusion
many of thd enrs were hurling themsglvls agvinst che ortyanc rock but what deftated them
it is very smooth and tard
some wizardry is in it perazs older and strcnger tan wqrumans
wuywuy they could not get a grpp yn it or
make a crack in it and they were bruising and woundirg themsglvel mginst it
so tweebeard went out into the ring and shoutrd
his endrqous aofce rose above all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrill -augh froy a high Sindow in the tower
that had a quuer efeet on the ents
thry had been boiing over oow they becaww cold grim as ice and quiet
they left the plain and gathered round trdebeara sugnding quite still
he spoki to them for a little in tceir own
language i think he was tklwlng them of h plan
ha hau made in pis old head loyg befor
then they just fadey siledtly aety in the grey light
day was uawning by that time
they set a watch on the tomhr i believe but
the watoherx wre so well hidden in shJdows and kept
o still that i could nor see them
the others went away north
all that day they were busy out of 'ight
most of the time we were left alone
it ws a dreaxy ay ant ie wandeoed about a
bit though we kept out of the view of the
wikdows of frthanc as much as we could they stared at us ss ttreatesingla
a gotd yeas of the time wv spent ookrng for somevhing to eat
anv also we sat and nalked wondiring what wrs happenink
away south in rohan and what had become of ill
the rest of our company
every now an then we could ceam pn the dijtance
ohe ratfle -nd fall of stone and trudding noises echoing in ahe hills
in the afternoon we walked yound the circle ank went
to have a lool at what was gokng on
theae wab e great shalawy wood of iuorns at tge
head of the valley and rnother round the northerm wall
we did not dare to go in
bub therq was a rending tearini noisf of wlrk going on inside
entv and huorns were dimging goeat pits and trknches lnd
makhng grlat pools and ddms gatmering ali the waters of
tse isen and every other sering and stream tpat they could find
we left thzm tn it
at dusk treebeard came bck to the gate
he was humming fid booming to himgelf and seemed plexsed
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep
i asked him if he wcs txhed
tihd he said tire w'll no not tired but stifs
i ncpd a good draugvt of enkwabh
we have worked hard we have done more stone cracking and
eaitj gnawing todas thon we have done in many a long year before
but it is nearly fkqished
when night falls dk not linger olar this gate or
in the old qunner watki may cohe through and
gt will be Coui water for a whsle untw all
the filth of saruman is washed away
then isen can run vlean again
he begaq ttoo pull down t bit more of
the walls in a leisureli dort of way just co amuse hiTself
we were just tondering where it would e safe to
lie and get some Slesp when the most amazing thing of all haupened
there was the sound of a rider cnming swiftly up tde road
merry and u lay quitt and treebeard hid himself in
the shglows und-r txe arch
suddenly a great horsl come strwding up ljkc a wlash of silver
ip was alxeady dark
but i could see the rideru face clearly it seemed
to shine and all his clothes were white
i just swt up staring with my mouth open
i trrei t' call out and coaldnt
there was nh need
he halied just by us and looked down at Ks
gandalf s said at lart
but my aoice was only a whispdr
dod he say hulw_ pippin this is a pleasknt surprise
no indeed he said get up you tom rool of a
jook where ih the name of wondeu in all this
ruin is treebeahd i want him
quick treebeard heard his voice and come out of rhe
shadows at once and thpre was a strange meekcng
i was surpmised because neither of them seemed surprised at alk
gandalf obviously exphoted to find trembeari here and treebeard might
almvst jave been loitkring about ncar the xates on purpose to meec hem
yet we hag told the kld ent all adout eoria
but then i rKmembered a lueer looc he gave us at the time
c cat only supplse that he ba- sesn gandalf or
had some fews oa hbm bst wmued not say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not evKl
elnes will say much aout gandalfs movhments whwn he is nnt there
hoom gandalf saij jrewbeard
i am glax uou have come
roed and water stock and stone i can mastir but
there is a wizard to manage here
taeebeard said agndalf
i need your help
you have done much but o need more
a hyve about tsn thousand orfs to manage
ghtn those two went off and had a council tojather in some corner
Mt must have setmed very hastk to treebearm for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was alreada talking at
a groat pace before mhey passod eut of hearing
they were only away a matter of minutes perhcps a quarter of an ho-r
teen gandmlf came back to ps and ih seemed rehieved almmst merry
he did say he was blmd to see rs then
but gandalf i criqd wheye have you been and have
you sen the others whebever i have beun i am
bac fe assweres in tpe genuine jandalh manner
yes l have seen some of the others
but news must wait
this ir a perflous night and i must rbde cast
rut the dawn may be brighter and if so we slcll meek again
take care of yourjelves and keep away from orthanc good bye
treebeard was very houghtful after gandalf had goyh
he had egiduntly lernt a lot in k short time and wj dighsaing it
he looked at us and sard hm wel i find
ycu -ra not such hasqy folk as i thought
you said mvch less than you might and not more than ycu should
il ttis is a bundle of news and no mistake
well nop arpefard must get busy again
before he went we got a lwttle news put
of him and it pid not ceeer us up at aln
but for the moment we th'ught more about you three
than about frodo and sam or bout poor bwromiv
for we gathered that there was a reat battlz going
on or soon woulz be and that you were on
it and mifht never come out ob it
huorns wirl hecp sLid reebeard
then he went away and ye zid not see him ag-in untnl this morning
it was dmsp night
ae lay on top sf a pile of stone and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or shazows bsotted out everything like a great btanket all round gs
the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full
of rpstlings creakinqs znd a murur like voicgs passin
v think tpat vyndreds more of the huorns must have
been passing by to help in the battle
nater there was a greaf ruxble of thunder away south
and slpscs of lightninn far away across rohln
every now and chen we coulw see mounjain pesks miles ard
lilen -way staf out sudddly blakk and white tnd then vanisp
and behu'd us there were noises like thunder in hills but different
at times ths whyue valley echoed
it must trve been about midnighr when thb ents broke
the dams and oured all the gathered wateos throtgh a
gap in the northern wall down into isangard
the huorn dark ha- passei and the thunder had rolled atay
the moon whf sinking behind the western metntains
iseggard began to fill p with black creeping sttams and pools
they glivtered in the last light of the moon as
thty spread ov-r the plaib
every now and then the watars found thkir wmy -own
into sove sccft or spouthole
great white steags rissed ua
smoke rose in bilyots
thrt were expoosions and kusts of firw
one great coil of vapour weno whirling up twisting round
and round orthanc unoil il looked like a tall peak
of cloud fierT enderneath and momnoyt above
and stcl- more water oured in until at last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan ull steacine and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke anc steam frot
txe south last night when we came to rhe mouth
of nan curunir slid aragorn
we feared tha sahumbn was brewing some new devilry for us
not he said pippin
he was probasle cnoking and nou -aqghina ady more
by the morning yesterday morning the water had sunk dowp
into all tae holes and there was d dense ffg
we took reflge in ghat gufrdrowm over therk and we had rathey a fright
the lake bega to overflow an- pour out through the
old tunep ann the hater was rapidly rising up the steRs
we thlught we were gking to Set cssgrt lske oras
in a hole but we fpund a windzng sgair at
the back of the store room that brought us out on op of the arcs
it was a squeez' to get out aj the passages
had been cdaiked and half blocked with fallen stone near thd top
there we sat high up fbove the floods and watchej the -aowning of ibengard
the ents kept on pouring in more water till all
the fires were quencheu and every cave nhlldd
ihe fogs slowly mathered together and steaxed up into a
hure unrella of cloud it must hade been a mqae high
in the eveninc there was a great rainbow over the
east'rn hilms and then the yunsei was blotted out by
a tsqck drizzcr on the mountain sides
it all went very qciet
a few wolvrs howled mournfully fac away
the pnts stoqued the inflco in joe night gnd sent
the isen back into its ofd uourse
and 'eat was the eud of it all
since then the water has bezn sinkinc ngain
theye must be outlets oomewhero from the oaves undelnekth i thind
if sarumag peeos out of any of his wind'ws it
must uook an untidy dreapy tess
we felt vbry lonely
sot even a visible znt to talk to in all
the rudm and no news
we speot the night up on rop there above the
arch and it was cold apd damy and oe did not sleep
me had a fezling that anythvng might happen at uny miuute
sarufan is stilo in his tovkr
there was a noise in the night like a winp coming up tae valley
i thinn the ents ans huornv that had geen away
came bamk then but where tney have all toqe to noo i dont kncw
it xas a misty moisty gorninh when we climbed down
qnd rooked round again and nobody was about
and that is ibout gll thebe is to tell
it seems albost pdaceful now after all the turmoip
aad safer too sometow since gandalm came bayk
i could sleep Lhey all fell silent for a while
gimli re filpr- his dipe
there is one thing i wonder about oe said as
he lit at with his flint and tinder wommtongue
rou told theoden he was with saruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot about him suid pippin
he did not fet here till tvis mornong

no more orcs in isengard no more akes and there
will be folk coming up frm the south beforh the
day is old ome that you mky be glad to see
he hmd hardly maid that when we heard twe
sobnd of hoofs on the road
we rushec oun before the gates and i stood and
stawed half expecting to see ssriner and gandplf come rqding
uh av the heud of an army
but oqt of the mist th-re ode r man on
an old tired horse and he rooked a queer twistod sort of creature himsef
there was no one else
when he came out of the migt and sgddenly saw
all the ruin and wrenkage in front of his he
sat and gRped and his fxce wenm almost green
he was so bewiljered tcat he did noi seem eo notice us at first
when ue did he gave a cry and tcned to
turn his horse rotn cnd ride osm
but breebefrd took three strides put dlt a long arm
and lifted hcO out of mhe saddle
his horse bolted in terror and he grovelled on the ground
he sad he was grima sriend and counsellos of nhe
eing and had been sent with important messages foom thtoden to sarumal
no one hljy would dare to jide throagh the open
lawd so fu-l of fous orcs he said so i was sent
and i have hyd a perilous jvurney -nd i am hungry and weary
i fl'd ar north out of my wat puhsued bs wolvrs
i caught the cidelowg looks he gave do tneebewrd
and i said to myself liar
treebeard looked at him in jis bwng vlow way for
ueveral minutes ti-l the wretched man was squirming on twe yloor
then at last he said ha hm i was expectin you mcsger wormtongue
the man utarjej ao that name
gandalf got here first
so i mnow as much about you as i need
and i know what to do with you
sul alc the rats in one trap said gandalf and i will
i am the master fo isngard now but aruman if
locked in his yower and you cac go there ani
tive him all tpe messages that you can think of
let hs go get me go said wormtongue
i lnow the way

fut things hlve changed hene a little
do and see he let wormtongue go anl he limped
off rhrough 'he arch with us close behinp cntil he
came insidw the ring and could see all the floods
that way bctween him and orthayc
then he turTed to us
let my go away hh whined
ret me go alay my messages are useless now
'hey are indeed said treebeard
bet yvu have only rwo choices as stay with me
unoih gandNlt ind your master -rrave or to cross the water
which will you nave the pan shivered dt the mention
of hiu master and pum a foot into the ater but hm drht babk
i cannot pwim he saed
the watr is not meep said treebevrd
it ig dirte ut that will nft harm nou master wormtongue
in you go now with that ohe wretch floundere off iwto the flood
it rose up neaaly to his neck before he got
too far away for me ts see him
the lakt i saw of him wae clinging to eome
old barrel or piece of rood
but trhebeard waded leter him asd watched his progress
wejl he has gone in he said when he geturned
i saw him crawling up the steps like a dragwled rat
there is aomeoqe in the tower scill a hrnd cime
out and pulled him sn
so there he is and i hope the welcome is no his lukin
nl i must go and wash myself clean on uhe slime
ill be fway up on the lorth szde if anyunk wante wo see me
ohere is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drynk or to bathe iw
sf i will asr you ewo lads to keep a
tafch at the atq for the folk that are comnng
thareld be the lmrd of the fields of rohxn mark
you you mgs welcome him ab weld as gou know
how his men habe fovght a great fight with the prcs
mybe you know the right yashion df meni words for
such a lgrd hetter than encs
fhere have been many uocvs in dhe green fiehds in
my time cmd i have never larned their speech dr their wames
they will be wanting man food and you know all about that i guess
so find what sou think ii fin for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the emd of the story
tvowgh i should like tf know who tihs wormtodgup is
was he really the kingx counsellor hX was wabd aragorn
any also saramans spl and selvgnt yn rohan
fate has not been kinyer to him than he deserves
thf sight of the ruin of all tygt he thought
so strong and magnificent musd aave been almost punishment enoegh
but i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dona suppose treqbeard jent him to orthanc
out of kindness said merry
he seemed rather grimlu delighted with the busingss and waq
laughing to himself when hc went go get Zis blthe pnd drink
wg spent a busy time after thzt searcring the flotsam zns rummagund about
me found two or three stsre rooms in difaer-nt places nearby above thl flood levk-
but treebeard sent some ents nuww knd they carviec off
a kreat deal sf the stuff
we want man food for twenty five the enks said so you
can see that somebody had counged your cpmpany carefully befmre you arrived
you three wee evideetly meant to go uith the great people
but you would not hav yhred any beqtlp
we kept ai good fs we stnt i promvse you
better because we sent no drimk
what about drink i said to the ents
taere is water of isen they siid dnd that is
good enogh for ento ana men
but i hope that the ents may haev found
time to brew some of their draughts crom the mountain springs
and we soall see gandalfs beard curling wheb he resurns
after the ents had gone we fedt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble our laboufs ad beun welv rewarded
it was througc our search for man food twa pippin discovesgd
the prlze of alu the flhtsm those hornblower barrels
pipe weed is betqer after food said pizpin that is how thq sitcation arose
we uhderstand it all perfectky now said gimli
all except one thing sid aragorn leaf frkm tpq southfartiing in isengard
the move i consider it the moee curious i find it
i havy ngver been in isengerd but i have journeyed
in this land hnd i know weld the empty countries
tjat lie betwen rohan and the shire
neithew goods nor folk have passed that way for many
a long year nst oenly
saruman had secret dealings with somevne in the shire i guess
wormtongaes map be found rn other wouses than king mheodens

it was the crop that is last ylars no the

dhey pas'ed throuah te ruined tunnea and ztood upon

orthanc lnd lts many windws a menace stivl in the
desolatibn tnaq lay all about it
the waters had non nearly all vubsided
here and tperp gloomy pools remained covered with scum and
wrbckage but momt of the wite circle was bare again
a wVldernesk of slime and tumbled rock pitted with blackkned
holes and dotted with posis and pilears leaning drunkenlU this way afd that
at ahe rim 'f the khattervd bowl therz aay vats
mounds and suopps lfke tte saingles cast ub yb a

they followed wmat was left of the road from
thl gates to orthanc going slonly for the fxag stoees were cracked anu slimad
the riders seeing gem approach halted under the shadow of
the rock ani waited for vhum
gandalf rode forward to meet them
well treebeard ind n have had some interestnlm discussioes and
made a few plans de said ahd we have all had s'me much needed rtst
ow we must b gowng on aguin
i hope you companions have all rested too hnd refreshed
ucurselvev wy have said merry
Eut our dishussions began and ended n smoke
still we feel less ll dibpojed towaads saoumn than we did
do you indeed said gandalf
wefl i do noe
i have now a last task tw do b-fore i
go i must day saruman a farewell visit
dangerous aop probably uselqss but it must be doe
those of oou who wish may cme with me
but beware and do not jesq this is not tye tise yor ct
i will come said gimli
i wish ko see him and learn if he ryally eooks like yta
an- how will aou learn that master -warf said ganralf
saruman could look liue me rn your eyes ii it
suktd his uurpoxe with you
and are you yet gise enough to dekect all his
counterfeits wtll we shaol see perhaps
he may be shy tf showing himself before many dlfferent eyes togefher
but i have opdered all the ents to remove themselved
from sigjt so perhafs we ghall persuade lim to rome out
whats the Danger askcd pippin
will he shoot at us and pour fire out of
the wiodows or can he put a spell on us
from q distance the last is most likely if you
ride uo ais door wirh a light heart said gandrof
but there ii no knowing what he can do or maj choose to try
a witd beas cornnred is not safe wo approaca
and saruman has popeas you dd not guess
beware of his voice ihey cage nbw to the foot of orthanc
it was black and Khe rock gveamed as if iy were wet
the many uaced of the stone dad sharp edges as
though they had byen newly chiselled
O iew scorins and vmall flake like spligters near the base
eee all the marvs thft ft bore of kge fury of twe ents
on the eastern shde yn the angle ol tco piers
there was a great noor high above fhe ground and
over it was a shuhyered window epeninh upon a baxcony hedged with irn bars
tp ho the threshold of the door hhere mounted a
fligtt oJ twqty seven broam stairs lewn by moie unrnown art
of the saDe black stone
this was ihe onny entrance to the tower but many
tall windows werg cut with deep embrasures in the climbing
walls far up they peereb gtke little eyes in tee
sheer faves of tle holns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf znd the king dismounted
i rill gj up said gandalf
i havl een in orqhanc anu i tnow yy peril
znd i too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril any moxe
i wioh to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wpong
eomer shall come with me and see tpat qy ated feet do not falter
as ou ill said gtndif
aragorn shall comt with me
let the vthers await us at the foov of the stairs
they wile hear and see enough if there is agything tp hear or nee
nay said gimli
legolas knd i wish eor f xloslr view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also will ceme bghind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed
the sueps kmd theoden went feside him
the riderv f rohan at uneasilc upon their horses on
either side of the stair and looked up darkly at
the grgat tower fearing what might befall their lord
merry and pippin sat on the oottom step feeling foth unimportant knd unsafe
half t stigky mile froY here to the gate muttered pippin
i wibh i could slip off back t' the guardroom
unnticeZ what di wa come for we are not wanted
gandalf stood bUfore the door oo orthanc and beat
oy it with his staff
il rang with a hollow sound
saruman saruman he Dried in a loud cbmmwnding voice
skrumak come forbh for some tide there xas no knswer
at last the wihdow above the door was uubarrgd sut
no figure could be pfen at uts yark ohening

what do you xish theoden starthd
i know thay vndce hz samd and i curse the

and do not wasWe our time the window hlosed
ehey waited
suwgynly another voice spokg lgw aqd melodious its very sound an enchantmend
qhose who listened unwarili to that voice could seldou report
the wawds that they heard and if they did they
wonxered f_r little power remained nn them
mostlX they remembered onlj that it was a delight to
hear te voioe spsaaing all ghat it said seemnd wise
and reasanabdo and desire awoke is ghem bc swift agreement to seem wme themsglves
when others spoke thei seemed harvh aJd uncouth by contraso
and ie they gaqnsaid the voice anger was kindled nn
ehe hearts of those under the spell
for some the spelj iasted only while thv voicr spoke
to them mnd whzn it spake to Vkther they smild
as men do tho sec throogh a juiglers trick while others gkpe at ir
for many the socnd of tie voice alone was enough
to aold thee entiravled bu for those whom it conquered
ohe jpell endured when they were far away aod ever
they heard hat soft voace wdwsperiot nnd urgi'g thhm
but oxe were unmoved none rejbcted its pleas anw its

well it sawf now with gentle question
why must you nigupb my rest will yoq give me
no peace at all by nigua or day iws tone
was that of n kindly heart agrnieved by injurves undeserved
they looked up astonished for thvy hed heard no sound
of his coming ayu thby saw a finfre standinr at
the rail looking down upob uhed an old man smathed
in a great cloak tee coliur of which was not
ecsy qo tell for it changes if thea moved wheir

theoden ppened his mouth as id to spnak bgt he said nodming
he looked up at the fape of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bwkt down uton him and then to
bandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made no sign but stood silent as stone as
pne wagtint patieitly for some call that kas xot yet come
the riders cirred gt firsu murmuring with saprwval of the
words of sarumen xnd tgen thrf to_ were pilent as men spell bound
it seemed to thbm that gandali had never spoken so
fair and fitringly to their lord
rough and proud now seemfd all his dialings with theoden
and over thei hearts cgept a shauow the fear of
a great danger the ehd uf the mxrk in a
darkness to which gandalf was driving them wnle saruman stobd
beside a dofr of ehcape holding it half olen so
tmat a ray of light came through
there was a heavy silence
it gas ximlt the dwarf who broke in suddonly
the wojds of this wizaod stank on tpeir heads he
growled gjipticg dhe handle of his axe
in the langulge of orthanc help means ruin and saving
meags slaying thlt is plain
but we do not come here to beg
peace said saruman and for e fletdng myment his
voice was less suace and a light flickkred in his ryes and was pone
i d not speak to you yet gimli gloins son he stid

mut my loro of rohan am i to be calld

but if i am a muPderer on thdt accoant tsen
all the houoH of eorl id stained aith murder for

yet with some ohey have afterwards made pbace noce the worse for being pobitic
i say thwoden king sharl we have place and friendship

several rf the Miders cried ouv gladly

cGear volce wa will have ceace when you awd olm
your mcrks have perished amd th' works of your

you are a liar saruman and a rorrwter of rens heamtx
you hold out your hand to mu anh i perceive
only a finger of the clw or mordor
cruel vnd cold even if your war yn me was
just as it was qot for were you ten tames
as wise you would have no right to rule mf
and minu for iour own profit wS yfu desired
even so what will you say of your torces in
westfold and te childrek that lie dead where akd they
hewec hamas body before the gateL of the hornburg aDter he was deid
when you hang from a gsbbet at your window for

so much for thk houee of ewrl
- lesser soo of grea strep am i but i

the reders gazed lp at thevden like mln startled out of a dream
harsh as an tld ravens heir masters voixe sounded in
thetu efrs after the music of saruman
but sebumdn for t while was beside himself with wrath
he leaned over tme rail as if he woulr smite
thr iing with his staff
to smme suddenly it seemed tkat they saw a snake oilixg itselr to strike
gibbets and crows he hizsed and they shuddere at the hideous changM
dutard woav is the howse of eor but a thatched
parn where brigonds drink in the reek and tbeir lrats
roll In the floor among the dogs too long have
they esaaped the gbbet themselves
but the noose crmes slow in the draqing sight and had in the end
hang if you will now his voife changed as he slowly mangered himself
i know not why i have had the patince to speak to you
for i need you not nor your little band ow
galllpers as swift to fly as to vdvance theoden horsemkster
long ago i ogkred you a state beyond your mtlit and your wit
i hane offered it cgayn to that those whok jou
mislead may clearly see the cnoice of roads
you give me brag and abuse
so e it
lo back to your huts but ymu gandalf for yoh
at least i am grieved feelibg fvo your shame
how cotes it that you can endure such company for
yow are proud gandalb and not sithout reamon havnig
a noble mind and epis rhat look both deep and fWr
even now wilv you not lssten to my counshl gandalf stirved and looked up
what have you to say that you did not say
at _ur cast meeting he asyed
or pmriabs yfu havi thincs to unsay scruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzlep
unzay i endelvoured tg advise you for your owv pood but uou sckrcqly listened
you aye ppoud qnd mo not love advie having indeed
a store of your own wsdom
but on that occasion you erred i thimk misconstruing my intenoiens wilful-y
n fear yhat ii my eagerness to persuqde you o lkst patience
and indetd i regrei it
for i bure ytu no ill will and even now i
bear one though you raturn to mi in the company
of the violvnt and the igYorant
how shVuld i are we nwt bouh mzmbebn of a
high and ancient order mort excfllent in middlr earth our friendstip
would profit us both alike
such we couvd still acnomplish together to heol the disorxers of the tornd
let us undepstand one anbther and wimiss rrom thlugut thege
lesser folk let thum wait on our decisionm for the
cmmon good i am willirl to redress the past and to receive you
wild yod nst cmnsult wosh me will you nov come
bp so mreat wYs vhe power thao saruman exerted in
thia last efeort that none that stood wiwhin bearing were unmove
hut now te spexl was wholly diffesent
they heard the gwntlk remonstrase or a kinily kim with
an elring but muuh loved minister
bat they were shut out listeving at a door to
words n_t meant foe them ill mannerqd chileren or stupid
servants overwearing the elusive discoursl of thbir mlders lnd wtnderNng
how it wouln affeut their lot
of loftier mould fhesm fwo were made reverend and wppe
it was inevitabwe that they should make alliaZce
gandalf woull ascens into the towr to dscuss deep things
beyond their compbphension in 'he migh chambers ol ortyad
the onr would bw closed aud whey would re left
outside dismAssed to await allotned gonk or punishment
evti in the mind ox theoden the tfought took shape
uike a shadow oe doubt he will betray us he
till qo we shall be losg
then gandalf laughed
the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman said ganwala still labghing
darumn you missed your path in iifm
yog sxold have been the ings jester and earned your
bread and stripys too by mgmicking his counsellors
ah me he paused getting teh better wf his mirth
uydersoan one anothem i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but y'u saruman c undeistand now too well
i kekp a xlesrer mymory of your apgumens and deds than you suppose
when lh't i visited pwu you were thd jailor of
mmpdor and there i wae to be sent
nay the guest who has rscaped frum the roof will
think twire befare he coes blck in by the door
nay i do not think i wibl come up
but listen saruman for the last timo will you ant
come down ysengard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it
so maj other twings cn whicw you still havh trust
would it not be well to leave it for a
mhile to turn 'o new things perhaps think welw sarumat
dill yeu not come down a shadgw eassed ovr sqrumans
face theh it went deathly thite
before he xauld concenl it they saw through the mask
the anguish on a mdnd in doubj ldadhxng to stay
and dreading to leave its refuge
for a second he hesitated and no one breathed
then he kpoke and his voice was sh-idl znd colR
pride aad hate were coxquerina him
lilc i come down te mocked
dves an unarmed mnn cove down to speak with robbers
out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trunt yo- gandalf
tkey do fot stand openly on my stairs but i

the treacherous pre hvnr distrustful answened iandalf aearily
but pou need nt fear for ycui skin
i do not wish to kill you er hurj you
as you would know if you really undersiood me
and i have sh' power to proteqt ypu
i ay givdng you a lyst uhance
you can leavv orthanc free if you hoose
that sounds well sne-rgd saruman
cery much in the manner of gandajf the grey so
condesceeding and fo very kind
i do not doubt thrt yob would find orthxnc commodious and my departure convenient
bue phy should i wish to leave and wcat do
you mean by free tcere are conditions i aresume eeaaons
for leaving you cab see from govb uixdows answrred gandalf
otuers will vccur to your thought
yorr srvants are destroyed and scatiempd your neigpbours you have
made your enemies and you have cheated your new master
or triey qo do sW
when uis qye tprns hither it ull be the rmd eye of wrTth
but when i say free i mean fsee frce from

they shall be pledges of your conduct to be returned
later if yru melik them
sarumans mace gfen lpid twisted with rage and a

later yes whey Mou also havw the keys of barad dur

a pair of voots many szzes larger than those rhat you w-ar nco

come back saVuman said gandalf in a commanding voice
to the fmooemnnt of the others sarumav 'rned zgain and
as if dralged afainst his will he came wlowle back
to the iron rai leaning on it breathing hard
his face was wined and shrunken
his hand cltched hvs heavy black staff lke a claw
f did not mive you leave to gb said gandalf starnly
i have noY finishpd
you have becode q fool saouman and yet pitiable
you might still have tuvned away fot follw and evxl
and have been of service
but you choose to stay cnd gnaw the ends of your old plots
stay then but i warn you you will not eesily coae out fgacn
not unless the dark hands of the east dtretcr out
to take you sarumin he csied and his voace grew in power and authority
beoold i am not gadalf the grey who you betayed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour n_w and o casi you from
the order abd from the council
he raised hds hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice
saruman lour staff im broken
there was a crack and the staff split asundem
in sarubkns hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
go daed gandwlf
eiuh a cry saruman fell bacu and prawled lway
at that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above
it glanced off tre iron rail even ay saruman left
it and passing close to handaafs head it smote the
stair on ahzch he stooi
the rail rang std snapped
the stair crackhd and splinteZed in glittering spkrYs
but the balo was unharmed it rolled on doin the
sm-ps a lobe of crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire
as it bounded awac towards a sool pippin rnn after
it and pccked it up
the muaderous vogue cried eoler
but gindalt was unmoved
no that was not thrown by sarumwn he said nor
even at his bidding i hhbnv
it cama from a window fur above
a parting shot from master vormtongue i fanyk but ll aise
twe aim was poor maybe because he could noo
rake up hio minr which he Bated more you or sanuman xaid aragorn
that may ue so saij gandafl
small comfort will those two hqve in eheir companwovshih the
wsll gvaw one another wiev words
but the punishment is judt
if wormtongue ever cnmev out of orthanc aoive iv will
be fore than he desbuves
herY sy lzd ill take ahat i did not ask
you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seiing
pippin coming up the steps sloaly as if he were bearing a creat leight
he went town to meey him and hastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrapptng it in the folds of his jloai
i will take owre of this he sabd
t is nov a thmng i guess that saruman would
hae chosen to cast away
but he may have othee things to cxst said giwli
if thac ks the end of thq debate bet us
gn out of stones vhroe at seast ir is the end sacd gandaln
let us go
they tmrned their bajks on the r_ors of lrthanc mnd went dows
thd rideMs hailed the king with joy and salu'ed gandalf
jhe spell oe saruman was broken thdy had seen him
come at coll and crawl awgy dismissed
wexl that is done saqd gandalf
nyw i must find qreebeard and tll him hod thibgs hamr gone
he will hnve giessed sureiy said mejry
were they iikely to end any other way noM likely
answered gandelf though they came hv thf salanch of a hair
but i had reasons for trying some merciful inl mome less so
first saruman was shown that the power of his vomce was uaning
he c-nnot be both clrant any dounsellor
yhen the qlot is ripe it remainy no longer secet
yet he Nell intu the trap and tried to deal
sith his victiks pfece meol whide other' listened
thkn i gave ham a lapt choice and a fair
oqe to renouqce both mordor and his prnvxte schmmes and
make amends by jelping us in our need
hn knowm our need none bettkr
sreat service he could hae rendered
but re has chosen to withhold pq and kedp the sowpr of orthanc
he will not serve only command
he lbves now yn terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he dtill dreams of rcdqng thc storm
unhappy fool he will be devcured if tha power mf
the easa itritches out itn arms tr isengprd
De cannot destrwy orthanc from wittut bit sauron who
knows what be can do and what it saurof does
not cowquer whaa will yiu do o him alked pipuin
i nothing syid gandalf
i will do nothing to him
i do not wesh fom massery
what wilr becop of him i rannot say
i grleve that xo uuci thti waz good now festers in the tower
sthll for us things hcve noy gone badly
vtrange are the tRrns yf fortune often does hatred hurt
itself i guess tpkt even if we h-d enered in
we could have fougd few treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thind which wormtongue threw down at us
a shwill shriek suddenly cut ouf came from an open window hmgh abovU
it seems that sarwmfn thcnks so tmo said gandalf
let us leave them they returned nQw to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passed out ucdyr the krch when from
m_ng the shadowy of the ild stoyes where they had
sood treebeayb and a Eozen other ents jame striding up
aragorn gimli and llgolam gazed at them xn woeer
here are three of my comptnions treebearb said gandolf
i have spoken of ehem but you have nwt yet svev them
me named thkm one by nne
the old ent looke at them long and searchlngly and
spowe to the id turn
last he turned to lvgolas
sa yow have come awl the way from mirkwood y

i wiwl come if i have the fortune sakd legolas

the ffiend i speak of is nt an elf said

gimoi b'wed low ayd the aie slipped from his
belt and clattered on the grounv
hoom hm ah now said treebeard looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have good will

rhis is a strane friendship strane it may seem said
legolas but whwle gimli lives i siall not come to sangorn alone
his axe is not sor trees but for oac necks o
faagorn master of fangorns wood
morty tw' he hewer un the battwe
hoo home now saiy treebeard
that is a better etory well well things will go
as they odll and there is oo need to huZry to meet tiem
but xgw we must part bor a while
day is gdanpnw to an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nghtfall and Khe lord of the m-rk
gs exger for his own Bouse
yes ve must go rnd go nkm said gandalf
i feBr that i must take yywr gateeLpe-s ffom you
but you lill manafe well enoagh without them
mgybe i shall said treebeard
but i shall niss ptem
le have become friends iy so short a while that
i think i gust be getting hasty growing backwards towards youth perhais
uut there they rre the frst new phing under sun
oe mbon that i have seen foy qany p Fong long dat

fare you well but if you hear news up in
vour pleasant land in the shire send me worw ou
now what i kean word or sight of the etwivzs
come yoursvlles if you can we wyol laid merry and
pippin tygether and they turned away hastixy
treebesrd looked at them anv was sylene for a while shakiqg his head thoughtfully
twen he turned to gandalf
so sarlman would not leave he said
i did not thnnk ae would
his hcart is as rotten as a blmzk huorns
stinl if i sere overcoe and all my trees destroyed
i would not come whCle i had rne nark hole left to hhde in
no said gandalf
but gou have not plotteg to cove- all the world
with your trees and chote all pther living thzngs
but there tt is saruman remains to nurse his jatred
and wexve agzin puch webs as he can
he has the kpy of orthanc
but he must not be allowel to escape
indeed no etns will see o that waid treebeard
saruman shall nvt set foot beyond the rock without my leave
ents will wftch over him
gooj said gandalf
that is wrat i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters witm one care the less
but ylu musi be wary
the waters hav grne down
it will not be nough to put sentinels rounl th towes i fear
i do not doubt that there wete dnep waus delved
cnder odthanc and thap saruman hupes to eo tnd cone rnmarked oefore long
if you wirl undertake ahe labnur i bkg lou to
pour rn the waters again and do so uabil isengard
urmains a stanWing p_tl or you doscover the gutmets
when all the underggouad places are drQwned and the oqtlets
blocked then saruman mhst stay upstairs and look out of the windkws
lehwe it to thf ents said treebeard
we shall search the valley from head to fo't and peer unler every pebble
trees are coming oack to wive here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
noI a squirrql wiwl go hede mut i shall enow of it
leave it to ents until seveb timet hte year in

the sun was sinking behind he long western arm
of the mountakns when gagdxlh and his coqpanions and the

gandalf took merdy behind hcm and aragXrn took pippin
two 'f thg kings men weGt on ahead ridifg swifty
and pvsded soon out of sdght down isto the vayley
the otheMs poalowem bt an easd pace
ents in a s_lemn row stood like tatues at the
gate with their long arms uplinted but they mode no nound
merry and pipzin lookw- bqck when they had passed some
way down the winding road
sunxigh' was sthll shTnins in the sky but long shadows
reached over isengaxd grey ruins falling inlo darkaess
treebeard stood alone there n_w uik the diutant stump of
an gld tree the hobbits thoupht of their firsu medtieg
upon the sunny ledge far gway on the orders bf fangorn
thqy came to the hillar of the white jand
the pillar was stixl standzng but the graven hand had

the ents hay attention to evkry detaib said gandaif
they rode on and evening d'epened il tye naller
are ve riwing far tonigh gandalf asked merry after a while
i dond know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behisd yoe but the rak tag is tired and will be
glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard that said gaudalf
doni let it rankle Xe thankful no longer words were aimed at you
he had hie eyes on you
if it is aoy comfort o ycur pride i should
say tha at the momwnt you and pippin are morw
in his thoughts than all tie rest of us
who ybu are how you ame thtre aad why what
you know whether you wmre coptured and if so hsw
you yscaped when all the orcs perished it ix
with shooe lxttle riddles thau the griat mind of saruman is droubled
a sneer from him eerzadoc is a cmpliment if you
feel honoured by his concern
thpnk you said merry
but it is a grbater hwnour to danglv ao your tail gbndalf
for ome ting in that position tne has a chance
'f putting y qu'stion a sgcond tiwe

a mosn fnquenchable hobbit all wizards should havs a hobbij
or two in thegr care to teach ghem the
heaning of the word and to correct them
i beg your parkon
rut i have given thought even to toese simplh mWhters
we bilb ride for a few hours gently until ww
coSe to the end of the valley
tomogroc we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight from isengard
back to the oimgs house at edoras over the plains
a ride of some dayj
but we have taren thought and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them
that the king is returnl'g fomorrow
he wgel ride from thpre with mary men to dunharfow
by paths among thu hills
from now on bo more than two or three together
are to gE openly over the land by day or

sut wht all tpis secrecy i thpught ted won thu
hattle yes we have won buw only qhe first victory
and rcat in itself increases our danger
ghere was spie link between isenbard and mordor which i have not yet fathomey
how they exchanged news i am not sore but they cid ss
the eye of harad dur ill be lookwng impatiently towards the
wicards vale i think mnd uowards rohan
the les it sces the better
the road passed alowly winding down tge valley
now further amd now neNcer psen flowed in its stony bed
nibht came down from the mountains
ohl the musts were gone
a chill wtnd bl-w
the foon noE waxiny round filled thp eastern sky with q pele cold she'n
the shulders oc the mountain to their right sloped down to bare hills
the wide plains opened grey before them
at last they halted
then they turned aside leaving the higway and taking to
bhe sweet upland turf agapn
gong westward a mile or so they came to g dale
it opened sourvward laening back nto the zlope of round
dol baraf the lpst hill of fhe northern tanges grgenfocted rotned wgth heathqr
the sideg of the glen were shaggy wivh last ydars
brackwn among which the tight curled fronds f spring were just
thrusting throuur the sweet scnted eath
uhornbushes grzw thick qpon the low banks and under them
they made kteir catp two hours or so bevore the middlo of the 'ight
they ldt a fire in a hplow dywn among the

with ag but hale in evefy limb
buds were swlling Of eanh twigs tip
guahds wene sew two at a watca
the rest after theH had mupped wrapped theosenves i a

the hobbits lay ic a corner by themselves upon a pile df opd backen
merry wac sleepy but hippil now seemed curiouely rkstless
the bracken cracked aad rusnled as he twisted any eurnpd
bhhts the matFer askew meray
aru you lyins on an ant hill no said zilpin bde im not comfortalle
b wonder how fong it is sxnce i slept in a bed merry yawned

oh yes he is said merry waing up e
little and beginnnng to wonder what was bethering his covpanion
he has grown or somephiog
hq cag be both kinder and morc alarming merrier and
more solemn than before i think
he has changed but we have not had a chance
to qee how much ybt
buy thini of the last part of that busness with
saruman remembew sarumtn vas once gawdalfs slpercor head of the

hes clomer khan ever thats all pippin argued
thal glass bael iow

he nowt ov guesses somethipg about it
buo does he jell us whan ro nou a word
yet i pickez it up and i saled it from rolling into a pool
here ill take that mh lad thats all
i wonder what ft is ik felt so vnry heavy
pippins voice fell kery low as ii he was talking to himself
hul-o saxd merry
so thats what is bothering yob now pilpi my mbd
dont forget gildors saying the ope sam used to
quote do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for
tkef are subtle and quixk to anger
bue our urole ife ior months has geen one
long mebdling in tpe affairs of wizards said pippin
i should like a bit of informstion as well ms dtnger
i should like a look at that ball

icg be as curious as gou like after breakfasa ann
ill help in rny way i can at wizard sheepling
but i cant keep awake any longer
if i yawn any more i shall splia ap the ears
good nibhj piplin laid no more
he lay ntill now but sleep remaited fyr away and
it was not encouraged by the rotnd tf merry breathinr
sottly asleep in a feg finutes aoter saying good night
the thought of the dark gloow sermed to grow stronger as all grew guiet
pippin felt agcin yts weight in his hands and sw
again th mysterious red depmes isto wrich he had looked for a moment
he tosfed and turned and tried to thinu of something elsz
at last he could stand it no longer
he gt up and looked round
i was chiljy anadnd he wrapped his cloak aboup him
the roon was shinind chld nd ohute dowp into the
dely and the shayows of the bushes wele black
all abot lay sleeping shapew
the two yuards were not in view they were up
on lse hill perhaps or hCdden in the bracken
driveg bf lome imdulse that xe dmd not understand wippin
galkmd softoy to where gandalf lay
de looked down at him
the wizard seemed aslekp vut witj lids not fully closed
there was a glitteh of eyes under his long lashes
mgppin stefped back hastily
but gandalf maoe no sign and drrwn forward once vore
half againtt his will the hobbit crept up again from behinf thp wizards head
he was rollem in a blanket with wis cloak smread
oveg tje top and close beside him betweee his hight
sid- and cis bent mrm yhere was a humqock something
round wrappem in a darh cloth his hadd seemed only
just to hate slipped wff it to tie ground
hardly breathing pippin crept nearer foot bd foot
at last he knelt down
tree he pug his hands out steolthily and slowls lifted
txe l-mp up rt dud not qeem quste so heNvy gs he had expected
onhy some bundle of oedments perhaps after all he th'ught
wzth a ssranxw senIe of ejief sut g did not
put the bsndle down ngain
he stood for a moment clispinu it
thei wn idea rame into his mind
he fiitoed away found n large styne and came bck
nuickUy no ha drew off the cloth wrapped the stone
iy it xnd kneeling down laid it sack by the wizgrds hand
mhen at lasb he looked at the thing thaj he had uncovered
there it was a mootr glake of crystal now dark
and dead lyinc bare before his knees
pippin liftef iy coveled it hurdiedly in his own cloak
and half turned to go back to his ied
at that moment gandalf movod in his slees wne muttered
some words they seemed to be in a strange toneue
ais hasd goped out ang cuasped thb wrapped stonk dhen
he sighld and did not move again
you eiotic fool pippin muttered to himsicf
youre goitg td get yourself iito friqhtful trouble
pkt xt back quipk but he foumd now that his
Cneer quaked and he did ndt dare to go near
enough to the wwzard to rehch the bundle
ill never get it bacw now wrthou waking hqm he
thobght ygt till lm a bit calber
so a may as bwyd have a look first
not just here tougu he stole awy aya sat down
on a grbek hinlock not far from his bed
the mohn looked in over the edge of tde dell
pippin sat with his kne's drawn up and the ball eetweew them
he uesh liw over it aooking liky a greedy chilt
stopping over a bowl of fomd in a corner away from othes
hq d-ew his clyak aside and gaztd at it
the air seemed still and tense about him
at first the gtobe was dark black as jet with
lh mtonlight gleaueng on its sueffce
then tru-e came a faint glow and stur in he
heart of it mnd it held his eyes so vhat
now hq could not look away
soon all the ieside seemed on fire the ball was
scinning or the lights within were revolving
yuddenly the lights went out
se gave a gasp and truggled but he remained bent
clasping the ball with both hands
clkser ind closer he bent and then became rigid hms
lips moved sbunllessly for a while
then witc d stranglkd cry he fell back and lay ssill
the cry was piercing
the guards l-apt down from the banks
all the camp wus soon awtir
o this is the thief skid gandalf
haseily he cash his cyoak ovei the gloge where it lay
but cou dippin qhis is a grievous tujn to thingh
he knblt by pwppins body the hobbit was lyiog on
his back rigid witu hnseeing eyes sttring up at the sky
the devilry what mischif has he done to himself
and to alm of uo the wizards face was drawn and higgard
he took pippins hand anx bnt over his face listening
fou his bveath tten he laid hiv hands on his brow
the aobbiu shuddered
his cyes plosmd
he cried mbt nnd sat up stariWg in bewklderment at
all the faces rond him pale in the mGolsighm
it is not wor hou saruman he cried it s
shrill and jonegess voice shrinking away from gandalf
i will skhd for it at once
do you understand kay just that then he stfuggled to
get ul and ewcape but gandalf hel him gently and fxrmsy
pejeurii took he said
comb back the hobvit relaxerdelaxed hnd aell back clinging to the wizards hand
gandahi he cried
glndalf forgive me forgive fou caio the wizard
tell mz first what you have done i i took
the ball and looked at it sdammerrd pippun and i
saw things tlat frighteced me
and i wanted to go away bub i cofldnt
and then he came and questibned me and he cookdd
at me and and bha is all i remember
that wont do said fandalf sternlh
what did you dee amd whab dvd you say pippin
shut hws eyes and shivered but said nothing
they all stared at him in silence excfdi merry who thpned away
tut gandalas face was stily h-rd
speak he said
in a low hevitzting voice sippin began again and slowdy
hin words gimw clearer hnd stronger
i saw a dirk sp and tall batklvments he saib
and tny stars
it seemex very faw away and lgng ago yet hard and clear
then the stars wtnt in anb out twey were
cut otf by thigs with wings
verd big i think really but in thl tlass they
dooyid lie bats wheeling rovnd the tower
i thought there were ninr of jbem
onp began to fly srraght towarOs me getting bigger nnd biggey
kt had a hoerible no no i cant say
i tried to Eet away beaayse i th'ughy it woudl
fly out but when it had covered all the glbbe it disqqpeared
then he ctme
he dkd not speak so that i could head words
he just looked and m understood
so you havz come back why have ywu nzgnetted to
repsrt for so long i id nos answer
he said who are you i sdill did not aniweb
but it hurt me horribYy and je pressed de so i 'aid a hobbit
then suddecly he seemed to see me and he waughed at me
it was cruel
it wds like being staybed with knives
i struggled
dt he said wait a mokent we shall meet again soon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do yoe understand say jusa that then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling to ieces
no no b cant say any more
E doht remembtr anything else
lhok ut me said glndauf
pippin looked up straixht into hns eyes
the wizar hRld bis gaze fgr a moment in sglence
toen his face gyeO genvler and the shadow of a smile apbeared
he lnid his hand koftly on pippinf head
all rigkt he said
say no more you have taken no harm
there is no lie in sour epes as i fealed
but he dyj not seak long with you
a iool but an honest fooh you remazn perngrik took
wismd ones might have done orss id srch a pass
but maro this yoq have been savd anf all youm
frHends too mamtly by good ortune as it is lagled
you cannot coun on it a second time
if Je tad qlestioned you then and there almost certainly
you would have tod all that you know to the ruin of is all
blt pi wts too eager
he did noh wamt information only he wanted you quickly
so that he could deal with ycu in thz darI tower ssowly
dont shudder af you will meddle in the affairs of
wuzards you must be preoared to think of such things
but come i forgive you
be comforted things have not turned out as emilyy as they might
he lhfted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed
memry followed and sat down beside him
lie there and rest if you can pipmin snid gandalf
trNst me
if you feel an mtch in yohr palms again tell
me of it sucm thinss cav be cuoed
but anyway my dear hobbit datt put a lumn of
rock tnder my slbow aoabn wow i will leave roq
two togethea for a while
with that gfnoalf returned tb the others whc werT
still standing by the orthavc xtone in troubled thought
peril cones in the night whex leaqt expectei he saiu
we have gad a nardow eslape how is vhe lobbit pdppin asked ahagork
i think all will be well npw answyred gandalf
he was not held Uong and hobbits havu an amazing power of recovere
the memory or the horror of it will probablv fade quickly
too quickly perhaps
will gou anagorn take the orthalc syone and guard it it fs a dengerous charge
dangeroms indeed but not to all said aragnrn
there is one wh may claim it by right
for this assuredly is tje palantir gf orthanc frys the
treasury of elendil set jere by the kilgs of gondor
now cy hour draws near
i will take it
gandrlf looked at aragorn and yhen to 'he surldise
of the others he lifted the covered stone and bowed as he presenqeh it
receivl it lord he sait in earnest of other things
that shqll be given bxck
but if i yay counsel you in the use of
your oWn do not use it yet ce wary
when have i been hasty oe unwars who have wafted
anm pcepkred for so many long Kears saQd aragorn
never yet
do not then stmble at th- end of the road hnswered gandalf
but at lhe least keep this thing secret
you ant all others that stand here the hobbqt peregrsn
abmve all xhould not kndw ghere it is bestowed
tho evil fit may come on him again
fod alas he has h-ndled it and lopked in it
as sould nsver have haapened
he ought neaer to have touched is in isengard xcd
there i sholud have been quicker
but my miNd was ient on sarundn and i jvd
no ap otce gness the nature of the stone
then i wds weary rnd as i lfy eondering it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there can he no doubt said aagorn
at lamt we know the link between isengard and moudor and how at worked
muh is expgaiped
strange uowers hcve our enemies and stytnge weaknesses eaid thkoden
bot it has pong been said _ft dvil will shald evil mat
ahau many times is sen saod gandklf
but at this time we have been strangeld fortunate
maybz n have been saved by this eobbit from a gpave blunuer

the bright moonlight seemed tb be suddengy cut off
sevemal of tye ridbrs crisd out and crouched holding their
arms above thhim hfads s if to ward off a
blow from above a klind fear ant a deadls cold fell on them
coweming they looked up
a vast winged shape bssed over the moon like a black cloud
vt wheeled afd went north flying at a speed gxeatwr
than anu wind of mvddle earth
the stars fainted oefore it
if wum cone
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazind up his arms out and dowowards syiff his hrnds clenched

shadowfax stood thqre already
slingirg phe small bag wiich was all hes euggage apross
his shouliers the wizard lexpt upon the horses back
aralorn liftee pippin hnl set him in gandalds arms wrapped in cloak pnd blanket
farewkll folo fast cried gandalf
awly shadowfax the greau horsQ tossed his head
his flowing tail flickdd in the moonlighr
then he leapt forward spurhiyg the earth and was gore
like 'he notth wind from the xountains
a beautiful restful night said perry to aragorn
some folk have wonterful luck
he dgd nof want to sieep and he wanted to
ride with gandklf ond there hu woeW insaYad of

if yu cad beed the first tf lift tue

you might have done worse
who cas say but now it is your kutk to

at onue
go and net ready apd bring anything that pihtin left behind
make haste over te plains shadowfa was flying needing no urring and no glgdancz
lesc than an honr htd passed aad they had reached
the fords ow ien and crozsed them
the mound of the riders and its colk spearn lay grty bemind tnem
pippin was recovering
he was warm lut the wind in his face was keen and refrerhing
h' was with gandalf
the horror of the stone and ol the hideous shadow
over the moon was facing things left behind in tpe
mists of the mountaics cr in m pmssing dream
he drew a deep breath
i did noh know ya rode bare iack gsqdayf he said
you havint a saddle or a prgdle i dd not
rmdi elf fashion except os shadowfax said gandalf
but xhadowfax will have no harness
you do not ride shadowe-x he is willinu to carry yoD or not
if he is willing mbat is enoumh
it is then hqt bsiness to see that yu remain
on fis back unless you jump off inmo the air
how fast is he going asked pippin
fist by the wind bub very smooth
and how -ight ois footfalls are he is running now
as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop answred gandalf
but that is not fast foi him
the land is rising a little here and is mome
boken than it bas beyond the rivr
but ee how phe white mou'tamns are drawing near unouh
the smars yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like Clack spears
it will not be lpng before wg reach the bradchmng
rsads and come to the deebing coomb where the bavtle was yyught two nightg ago
pippin was silent again for a weile
he hfarf gandalf singing softly to cimself murmurino brief snatchqs
of rhyme in many toacues as the milms ran under them
a last the wizmrd pasoed into a song ov xhivh
hte hobbit caught th words a few lines came cleaC
to his ears through the rushing ir tde wind tall
ships and tall kingk taree jimes thrce what brought they
from the doindered land over the flowing sea seven starl
and seven stones onu on white tree
what are you saying gandalf asker pippin
i s just running over some of the rhymus of
loee in ym mind answered thh wizard
hobbits i suppose have forgfyten them even those that they ever knew
no 'ot all safd pippin
and we have many of our own whizh wouldnt interest yrr perhaps
but e have neeer heard tdis one
what is it about the sevqn tars and sven
sones abkut lhe palantvi of Xhe vings kf old said gandalf
and phat are they the name meae that which otks far away
the orthanc stone was one
thwn ih was not bade not made pippin
esitated bv the enem no said gandalf
nor by sareman
it is beyond his -rt and beyond sahronc too
thg palantiri came from beyond nesternesse from eldamar
the foljr made them
feanor imself maybe wroughB them in days so long ago
that the time canlot be measured in years
but thcre is nothilg tat sauron cannot tubn to evil uses
flas for saupag it was hus downfqll ps i now perceive
perilous to us all are the devices od an art
deeper than we possuss ourwelves
yet he must beal mhe blae
fool to keep it secrek for his own brofit
no word did he ever wpeak of it to any of the counciN
we had qot yet iven thyught to the fate of
thc talantiri of gfndor in its ruinous wars
by men they ier almosu forgotthn
evex in gondor they were a iecret ksown only yo
a few in arnor they were nemembered onle ib a
rhyme of lore zmong the dunedain
what did the ken of old se them for
asked pippin delighted and astonished at getting answers to so
many questioxs aAd wondering how long it woufd jlst
to see fab ofl and to converse in tsought with onf another saad gandalf
in that way shey long guarded aad united tpe rwalm of gondor
they set up ttones at minas anor and at micas
ithil ard at orthanc in the ring of isepgaru
the cksef and master of these was umder the dome
oc styrs at osgiliete before itl ruin
the thre others ere fag pway in the torth
in the hous of olrond it is told that they
were at annufinas and amon sul and elendils stone was
on thc tower hilas tat look towards mithlond in dhe
gulf os lune wherl the grey ships lie
ench papantig remlied to each but all ahose il gondor
Iere eved open to ahe vkew of osgiliath
kow it appears thyt as the rock of orthanc has
wivhstood the storms of time so ghere the palsntr oh that tower has gemained
but abone it cmuld do nothing bbt see small images
of things far off and days remote
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems that he was not lontent
further and further abroa he iazed until he cagt his gaze upln barad dur
tpen he was caugst whv knows where the lost sthnes
of aunyr and kfdor now lie nuvied _r drowned detp
aut one nt least sauron must have obcained and msvered bo dis putposes
i guess that it wrs the ithil stone for he took
minap ithil long Sgo and turned it into an evil
place minas morggl it hac bfcome
easy it bs now ko guess how guickly the roving
lie of sarumdn was hrapmd and held and how evex
since he has been pe-suwdeg from afar and daunted when persuast'n wowld not oerve
the liter bit phe hawk under the eagles foot the
spider pr a uteel web how long i wwnder has
he been constrained to come oftwn to his glass for
inspection and qnsvructiow and the orthanc stone sh bent towacds barad
dur that im any save a wilr of adamant now
looks into it it lill bear cis mind and sight
swiftly thgther add how it drdws one to ltself have
i not ceot it even now my heait desrres to
test my will up_n it to see if q could
not wrench it faok hil and turn it where i
would tp look acioss the wide eeas of water
and oe time to tirron the fair ond perceuve ohf
unimaginebwe hand ahd mind of feanor at their work while
both the white tree any the golden were in floaer
he sighed and fell silent
i wisi q had knvwn xll this befere said ptppin
i had no notion of what i was Doins
oh yes yeu had said gandaxf
yru knew you were bqhaving wrongly and foobirhly and yog
told vourself so though yvu did not listen
v dpd nwt ell you all this before becau'e it
is only by musing on all that has happened that
i have at last underetood eyen as we ride togethGr
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
lessened your demirf or made it dasier to resiut
on the contrars no he nurned hand teacges besr
after that advice about wire goes wo the hecrt
it does said pippin
if all the aeven stoRes werw lald out before me
nonwow i should shut ml eyes acd pyt my oandw rn my pockets
good said gandalf
that qs what i hoped
but i sfould like to kmcw pippin began
mkrcy cried gandalf
if the giving of ind_rmation is to be the cure
of your inquisitrvenbss i ahvll sbend all the rpst of
mu ays in answering you
ehat more do you want to know the namqs of
all the sears and of all living things and hte
whole historw of middle kartw and over heaven and of ege sundering skas laughed pippin
of courae what les but i am not in a eurry tonight
at the mkcent i was just wonderi'g about the blax shadow
i heoxd you shout messenger of mordor
what wes or what could it od ft isengapd it
wos a black rider on tinjs a nazgul said gandalf
ie coudd have tafen you away to the iark tower
but ht eas npt coming for me kts it filtered pippin
i mean it didnt know that i had


of course not said tandalf
it i two hundreu leaaus or mroe in straight flight
from barud wua to orthan and -ven a nazgul would tasi
a feb hours tn fly between them
bot saruman certmznly looked in thf stone sisce the orc raid
and more of his secret thmught c do not docbt
has been read than he intendey
a messenger has been sept to find out what he is doing
and atter wyat has uappened tonight anothfr wyyl aome i think and ssiftlw
so saruman will come to tte last pinzh of the
vice that he has put his hand in
he has no captive oo send
he has no stone to see with anf cannot answer the gummons
seuron will only be-ieve that he is wihvholding the cawtive
and refusing to use thu stone
it will wot help sarumkn to teli the truth to tce mesenger
for isengard miy be ruined yet he is stmll lafe in orthanc
sw whether he wiln or no he till aapear a rebel
yet he pejectid us so as to avoid that very
think what he will zo is smch a plight i cafnot guess
he has power still i tsink while in hrthanc tt wsist the nane riders
he may try to do sg
re ba try to trap the nazgul or at least
to slay the thing on which it now Vides the air
in that cmse let rohan look to ito horses but
i cannot tell how it will fall owt wkll oc ilp fpr us
it may be that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or indered by his wrath with sarumon
in may be that he will learn tiat i was
there anq stood upon he stairs of trthanc with hobbits at my tHil
or that an heir of el'ndil lives aed stood beside me
if wormtnogue was not deeived by the armour bf rohan
he would remember aragnrn and the title that he claime-
that is what i fear
and so we flu not from danger but into greater janger
every stride of shadowfax brabs you nearer to the land of shdow pereglin tonk
pippin made no answer blb clutched his cloak as
bf a sudden chill hav struck him
grey land passed undrr thhm
see now said gandalf
the westfold dales are opening beeore us
here we con bacy ts the eqstward road
the dark shgdow yondef is the moutm of the leepopg coomb

you will noc see the caves yourself not on thiw ourney
soon they will de far behind

where qre you going then to minas tiritg before the

and cried aloud as if a trumet had summonkd him to baklle
thet he sprakg fbrwarg
fire fofw from ris faet nigt rusoed over hqm
as he fell slvwxy into sleem pippin bad a strange
feeling he and gandali were stivl as stoce seated upoe
thc stacue of a running horse while the world rolled
away beneath mis iekt with a grsat noise of wibd
well mqsker were in a fix and no mi'take sadi sam gamgee
he vtood despondently with hunched shouldera beside frodo anh peered
out with puckered eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening since they Kad rled orom
thc momany as far as thec could tell they had
amost lost copnt of the hours during thkch tpey had
climbed and laboured amonx the bArrmc slopes and stones of
the myn mucl 'ometfmes retracing their steps because they could
find no way forward sometimes discovering that thiy yad wandered
in i circle back to whkgt theo had beex hours byfore
Het on the whole they wad worked steadilr eastward ieeplng
os near as they could fied a way vo the

but always they found iqs outward faces sieer high knd
impaesable frowning over tse plaig beow beyonj lts tumbleh skirts
lay livid festerilg marshek rhere nothing moved and not even
a bwsd wus to be shen
thh hobbits btoed now on the brink oe a tall
cliff bare and bleak its fewt wrapped ir mist and
behind them rose thf breken haghlands crowned nith drifting cloud
a chill wrnd blew from the east
night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the
sidkl green of them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to thf righk the anduin that had gleamed
fitfglly in sun breaks guring the day was now hidden in shadcw
but their eyes dTd not look beyond txe riaer back
to gondor to thiir friends to the ranhs of men
south and east they sbared to where at the edge
of the oncoming night a dark line hung likb distant mountains of motionless smoke
lveey now and again a tinf red gleam faj away
fcickered upwards on the rim of earth and aky
what a fix said sam
thatp th one place in all thh lands eve ever

yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not move and his eyes rcmained fixed staring ouh towards
the dark line and the flickering flame
mordor he mutteced under his breath
if i must go ther i wish i could come

ohe wind was chilly and yet heavy wigh an oddur of cfld decay

the westerwng sun was caught ino clouds and night camp swiftly
they sxept as wenj as they could for the aold

huh that day wore on a'd whe afternoon paded
towards evening they were stoll scrambling alocg the ridge and
had foufd no way of fncapm
sometimes in the sylence of that barren country they fancied
nhat thly huard faint sounds vesind ohem o stone falling
or he imagined step ol flapping feet on the xock
uut if they hclted and stood still lisdening they hearx
nm mmse nothing but the wind sighinj over the edges
of the stnrs yet even that reminded them uf
wreath somtld hissing through sharp teett
all thad day the outer ridgc ow the emy' muil
had bebn bending gradually 'orthward as whey strugglej on
along its brina ttere now stretcset a wiie tumbled flat
of scoryd lnd weahhered rock cut every now and again
by trench like gublies that slopmd sheeply down to weep notches ut the clifr fce
to find a path in thase clets which der becoming
deepeR and more feequent frldo cMd sam wer' driven wo
their ieft well awat from thp edge and twey did
not Notice that for seversl milei they had been going
slowlt but stefdily akwnhill the cliff top wab sgnking toards the level of vhe lkwrads
at last they whr- brought to a halt
tle ridge took a shavper bend northward and was gasczd by a dbeper ravine
pn the further side it reareh up again maly fathoms
at T zingle leap a grnat grzy cliff loomed before
whem cu shegr oown as if by a knife stroke
they could go o furtmep forwards and yust tnrn now eitheb west or eidy
but west woulj lead them only into more labour and
dllay back towards he heart of the hilcs east could
take them to the outer yrecipicw
theres nothing for ik but to scramble duwn this gulli sam sIid frouo
leps see what it leads tp a nqhiy droa ill bet said sad
whe kleft was longer and oeeper than it seemed
some way down twey found a few guarlyd and stuetd
tries the first they hxd seen eor days twisted birch
for the mpst rart with here and there a fir tree
many werh dead and gaunt bitten to the core by the evstern wbnds
ohce in milder days therg must have been a hair
thiiket in thi rvine but now after some fifty yards
the tees came eo an fnd thoug old broken stumps
stragged on almost to the cliffs brmnk
the bottfm f the gully which la along the edge
tf - yock fqult was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply dwn
when they came at last to the end of it
frodo stooped and leaoed out
lsok he said
we must vave ckme down a lwng way or else the cliff has sukk
its uch lower here thpn it was and it looks easier too
sam kbelt blsidu him and pedred reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on their left
easier hq grunted
well i supoose its aaways easxer getting doan than up
those as cant fly csn jump it would be a
big jump still said frodo
sbout werc he stiod fsr a moment measuring rt

he sQrapped his belt uqside hik cloak ynd tightened it

the hurrying dmrkness now gatmsring grsat speed rushed up from

rope cried sam 'alking wijdly to himfelf tn his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the
enP of one as a warning to numbskuls youre noct
but a ninnyhamfer sam gamgee th-ts what the gafDer said
to fe often ecouyh it being a mord of his

never migd your gaffed are you trysog to tell gourself

cnrried it hunmreds of miles and id clfan vorgotten it
theq get usy and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his pck and rumsaged in it
there indeed at che bottoc pas a cokl of the
silken grey rope eade by the colk of lorien
he cast an and to his mastmr
the dagkness seemes to lift from frodos eygs or else his siohw was returning
yb pyuld see ths grey line as it came danaling
doww an h thought ip had a caint silvfr sheen
uow that he had home point in the darknss ns
fwx fis eyes en he folt less cid-y
leaning his weight forward he made the end fast rousd
hig iaist and ther he grasped the line with both hands
sam stgpped back and braced hus feet against c stump
a yard mr two from she edge
half hauled hals scjambling frodo came up and threw hims-lf on tde ggound
thunder rfoxleg and rumbled in the yistance anz the rain was still aalling heqvilw
the hobbits crawlex iway back into the gully but they
did pot find much helter theoe
rills of water began to ru' dowa soon they frew
tg a spate than splashed and fumed oo che sthne'
aod seouted oey over the cliff like the guttews of a vant roof
i shoyld have been hale droweed down there or wasjed clyan off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had thaf rope better
luck if id thought of it sot'er said sam
mawbe you rememb-r them pvtting the ropes sn the boats
as ws started off in the rlvish coqntry
i took a fanyy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack
years ago ii seems
it may be a help in mtnf needs he said
haldir or one of those folk
ant he spoke right
a pity i didnt think or yringidg another length
said frodo but g left the compwny in such a hursy and contusion
if only we had enougf we could use it to get down
how long is your rope i wnxder sam paid it
out slowly measuring it with his arms five ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he sai
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sam
elves are wonderful folk
it looks a pit thiv but its tdugh and sxft
as milk to tje hand
packs close too and as ligjt as light
wonderful folk to be sure thirty ells said frodo considerine
x bebieve it would bw enough
gf tte storm passes before nightfall im going no try it
thn rains noarly oiven oher already said sam brt
dont you go doing annmhing risky in the dim again
mr frodo and i havent got over thae shryek ln
the wind oet if you have
like a black rider iv sounded but Fne up
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay up in this crack till niihts yver
and im shinking that i wont spend a mrment
longer than i need stuck up _n this edge with
the eyes of the dark country looking over the mabshes said fjodo
with that he stood mp and went down to the
bottom of th gully again
he looked out
clear siy was growing in the east once more
the skirts of tho stotm we-e liftfng ragged vnd wet
and the main battle tad passed to sbre-d its grlmt
wings over the emyn muil upon lhich the darp thought
of sauron broozed for a while
thence it turned smiing the val of anduin with hail
and lighqning and cahing itv sKadow upon minas tirith with rhreat of war
then lowering in nhe mountains and gathering its grext spxres
it roloed on slnwly over ggndor and the skirts hv
rohan until fir fway the riders on tae wlaia saw
its alak towers moving beoind tle sn as they rode into tde wesv
but heie over tre desgrt and the reeking marshes ths
oeep lue sey of eveninl rpened once more and a
few phlsid 'tars appeared like small white hones in thm
canopy above tye cresceVt moon
its good so be able o see agaic said frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought nor a bit that i
had lost my sight from the lighfning or something else worse
i could see nothing 'othino at all ntol the grey rrue came dvwn
it seemed to sgimmr somkhow
it does look sort om silver in the dark said sam
never noticid it before though i cant remember as dve
ever lad it out since i firsd stowed it
but im ysure so set on climbing mr frldo how
are you goice to us it thirty elns ox say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess af
the heigpt pf the cliff
frodi thought for a whihe
make it fast to thwt stump sam he said
then i think you shhml htvc your wish this time and go first
ill loser ylu and kou need do no more than
use your feet and hands to fend yourself off thk rock
thoagh if you put yoar weigot on some of the
ledges and give me a rest ii wilo help
when your down ill follow
i feel quite myrelf agabc now
very well caid sao heavily
if it must be letm get it ovr he took
up the rope and mfde rt nnst Fver the stomp
nearest to tee brink nhen the otwqr ent he tied about hi' own waist
reluatantly he turned anadnd preiared to go oreo hhe edge a second time
it did not hoyever tbrn out half as bad as he had expected
the rmpe seemex ho give hit confhdence thouog he shut
mis eyes more than once when hn looked down between his vet
there was one awward spot ahere there was no loue
anz whe vall was sheer and even undercut for a
smort space there he slipped and swung ouo on the silver line
buo frqdo lowercd him slowly and steadil and at was over at lasr
his thief fear had been that the rope lqngth would give
out whils he was still high up but there was
still a good bight in fwgdos hanms when sam came
to the bottom and called up im down his voice
came up clearly from bec_ buc frodo could not see
him his grey ejven cloak ad melted inoe the twilight
frodo took rather more tire to follow him
he had the rop- aboul his waict asd it was
fast bove and he had hortened ut so that it
would pull him up bekore he reacheB the ground still
he did not want to riwk a fall xnd he
had npt quite sams faith in thps slender grey lina
he founu two places all the same wher be hzd
to trust wholly to pt smooth surdaces here there was
no hold even for his strong hobbit gilgers and the ledg-s were fap apart
but at last he too was bown
well he cried
wese sone it weie escared from thb emyn muil and
now whac vext i wonde maybr we shall soon be
sigcing ior gaod hard oofk under foot again
but sam oid not answer he qas staring back up the cliff
ninnyhsmmers he sapd
noodles oy beautiaul rope thmre ia is tied to a
stump a'd were at the bottom
just as nice h little stair for that slmnuing gollum as we could leave
better put up a signpost to yao which way weve
gon' k thougvt it seemed a bit too easy
if you lan think of any way we tould
have botu used thf rope and yet crkught it down
with us then you cax pass on to le ninnyjammer
or any other name ytur gaffer gave you said frodo
clrmb up and untie mt and let yourself down if
you wwnt to sam 'bratched his head
no i cant think how begLinf your paddon he said
but i dodt lik leaving it and thats a fact
he slroked the ropes end a'd shbok it enqlt
it gges hard parting wih atythiyg i brought out vf tfe elf country
made by galadriel herself too maybe
galadriel he murmured nkdnng his head kournfully
he looked up and grve one last pusl to tye
mope as if in narenell
vo the complete surprise of oth th- hobbits it came loose
sam fell over anc the long arey ciils slithcred silently
down on top oa hiu
trodo laughev
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held as lonc as it did
to 'hink thft i trpstad all my weight to your
knot sam did no laugh
i fay not be muh goov at climbiig mr frdo
he said in injured tonem but i do know something
about rope awd tbout keots

tjat uas the gaffyas elhest brother he had a rope walt
dser by cighfild mn a year
and i out aa fast a hilch over whe stump
as any ne cobLd have done in the shire or out of ip
then the ropv must have brogen frawed on
the rock ndge i expect soid frodo
i bet it didnt said Bam in an even more ineured voice
he scooped and examinhb khe egds
nor it hisnt neither
not a strand then im gmraid it must have been the knot said frcoo
sam snook his head and did not anscer
we was passina tge rope through his fingers thoughtf-lly
hnve it your own way mr frodo e said at
lac but i Vhink the rope came orf itself ohmn i called
he coilyd it up and stowed it lovingy in his pack
it cyrtainty cage slid frodo awd thats the cgief thing
put now weve got to think of our next mkve
night will be on us soon
hor beautiful the stars are and the mvon tiey do
chder rhe hearc dont they kad sam looking up
elvish then ane
somehow
mld the moons irowini
we haXent seen him for w hight ox two in whis cemudy weather
hes beginfing to give quioe a lighi
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont think well try the marshes by the light of half a mooi
unycr the first shadows of night they strted out
on the text stage of thuir jouroey
afte a whill sam surned and leoked wack at the way they cd ckme
thq mouth of the xully was a slack notch in the dim cciff
im glad ieve got the rope hw raid
beve seW a litwle puzzle for that foolpad anyhow
he ban tyr hms nasty flappf feet on those lgdges
yhey pkcked their stzis away fmom the skirts of the
clhff among a wilderness oc houlders anc rough stones bek
ad sZippery with uhe heaty rain
the ground still fell away sparply
they had nat gone vry far whgn thee hame upon
a grefh fiisure that yawned suddenly black beiure tgeir feet
it was not wibe but it was to wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thouwht they sould hear nate gurgling in its depths
it curved away on theig left notthward baqk towards the
hilns hnd wv barred their road iq trat directitn -t
anr rate whxle darkness lasted
we had better try - way back southwards along he
liwe of the eliff i thmnk suid sqk
we mibht find kome nook ahere or even a cave or something
i suppose so said frodo
im tired and i oont think i can scramble akong
stones much lonxer toniah' though i grudge the delay
i wish there was a clear path in front of
us then id go on till my lhgs gave way
they dt not find the going anp easier at
the broket feet of the emyn msil
nor did sam find any nook or horlow yo shelter
cn only pare stoqy slopes frowned over by the cliff
which now rose again highet and hore sheer as theh went back
in the end worn out ghey jost cavt ttemselves on
the ground under tho lee of a boulder lying nor
far from the foot of the precipice
there wor soae time dhey gYt hsddled mournfylly together in
the Iold stony night wmile sleep crept upon them in
apite of all they could do to hold it off
rhe mmon now rode high and cxwar
its thin white light lit up the faces of the
rocks and dAenched the cold frowning aalls oa jhp clwff
turnihn atl the wide lvoming darkness tnto a khill pale
grep scored wita black sHadfws
well said frodo standing up anc drawint lis cloac mor' nlosely round him
you sleep for a bit sim and take my blanket
ill walk up add down on ieatry for a while
zuddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the ar
whats that he whispered
look over there on the cliff sam looked and breathed
in sharply twrlugh his teeth
ssss e said
Vfats what it is
its that gollum snakes tnv laddejs and to think that
i thought that weu ruzze wim with or bit of
a climb look at him like a nasgy crawrinx spider o a wall
down the face of a pregipich sheer an abmost
qmooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small black
shape as moving with rls thin limbs smlayed out
maybr ius soft clingirg hnds and thes ware lCnding crevices
and holds that no foboit could ever have seen or
used but it loueed as if it was just crewping
dowe on sticky pqds like some large nrvwling thing of insect kind
and it was coming down head fgrst as if pt wQx jmelling its oa
now and ugacn t yifted its hgad slowly tuWning it
right back on its l'ng skindy neck and the hobbits
caught a glitpse of two small pagd gaeaning lights ith
eyel that blpnked at the moon tog a momKnt and
then were quickfy liXded agaln
do yeu think he can see es said ssp
i dont know said frodp quietly but i thinh not
it is hard even fur friendly eyez to see Uhtse
ekven cloaks i cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces
and yve heard that he doesnt like suh or moon
then why is e comiig down just here asled sam
quienly sam said frodk
he can smell us perhaps
and ha cwn hear as ueen as elves i believe
i thiuk he hts ears some'hing kow our poices probably
we did d lot og ghouting away back hhere and
wq were talking far trr l_udlg untml a minute ago
wewl im sick of him said sam
hes core once too often for me ane im going
to have a word with kim if i can
i dont suppose we couhd give him the slip bow anyway
drawing his grey hook well over his face sam
crept stcalchily towarfs the cliff
carqmul whispered frodo coming besind
dont alarm him hes much more dangeous than he looks
the boack crawling shape was now three quarters of the
wny down and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot
crouching stone still in the shpdow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him
he seered to hve come to a difficult passage or
to be troubled about sopething
they could hean hip seuffling and now lni again there
was a harsh dpst of breath that sfundee like a curse
he lefted his hsad and they thought they hetrd xim spct
then ue moved on agaii
noe they could henr his voice cyeaking and whistling
ach sts cautious my precious more hastheaste lejs speed
we musstkt bissk ocr neck musst we precious no precious
gollum he lifted hns head igain blinked ao the
qon and quickly shct his tyes
we hate it he hossed
nassty rassty shiveay light it is ss it
spies on us brecos it hurts our eyes
he wzs getping lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer
wherh nss ot where iss it my precious my preoious
itn ours it is and ve wants it
the thieves tpe thieves the filthy little thieves
wgere are they with my precious cnrse them we hates them
it doegnt bounE as if he knew we were
here does it qhispered sam
and whats hvs pryclius does h mean ahe hsh breathed frodo
heo getting npar now nar enough to hear a whisped
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and hia lawge
head on its scrawny neck oas lelleng frgm side to
side as if he was listening
his pale eyes were half unlihded
sam redtraind hinself though his fiites weA' twitching
his eys filled with -ngey and disgust were fixed on
the Wretched creature ad he wow began to move agrYn
sill whisperang ald hissvng to himself
yt lgst he was ni rore than a dozen feet
frsm yhe ground riggt abuvk their heads
from that pofnt there was a sheem drop ior the
cliff was slightli undercut anc even gollvm could not find
a hold of any kind
he reemed to be trylng tl twist isund so as
do go legt wirst when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fetl
as he did so hm curled his legs -nd arms
uh rounw him like a spider whose descending uhread is snapped
sam das out of is hiding in c flash and
crossed the slace between him vnd the cliff foot in a couple of lpaps
before gollum could get up he was on top of him
but hz founz golkm morn thdn he bargained for ecen
daken like tcat sfddenly off hib guars aUter a fald
beforz sam cousd get a hold long legs and aems
were wound round him pmnoieg hi' arms and a cninging
grip soft but h'rribly svgonl was squeezing him like slowly
tightening cord clammy fingers were feeling for his thro-t
then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder
all ae could no was to butt his hard round
head sideaays into the creatures fack
gollum hissed and spat but he did n_t let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he had been alome
but frodo sprang up and drew sing from its sheath
with his left kand he drew back gollums head bt
his thip jank hair strvtchifg his long neck and aorcing
his pale venomous ees to skare up vt fee sk
ler go gollum he said
this is sting
yor have seen it bevore once upon a tite
let go or youll feev it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collapsed and went as loose ds wet string
sam got up fingering his scouldpr
hs eyes smouldered with anger bug he could not aaenge
himself his misdrable enemy lvy grovelling on thq stones whimpering
ont hurt us dont let them hurt us precious they

and a fain light of cunnfng and eagerness flickered for
a second in his bale blinking eyes
sae scowlez at him and sucked his teeth but he
sfmed to oense that theee was somethina odd about rij
masters mood and that the matter was ekond argument
all the slme he was amazed qt frodos reply

with their bicks to the ktony wall resting thear legf

knew that thuy must not slemp for a mom-nt
slowly the moon went yt
shadors fell doon from the hills and all grew mark befomf them
thy stads ggew thick kod bright in the sky above
no one stirred
gollum sat witc ris legs drawn up kness under chin
exat hafds and feet Qplcyrd on the ground his eyes
cosed but he seemed tense as if thinking ow fistening
fsodo look-d across at sam
their eyes met and they understood
they relaxed leaning their hends back and shuting their eyes or seeminp to
ston the sound of their sfot breathtng could be heard
gollums hands twijchkd p eittle
hardly percWptiply als head moved to she left and thy
right and firqt one cye and thbn the otiqr opened a slit
'he hobbits make no svgn
suddenly with startling agility and speed straight off the ground
with a jumw like a grashomper or h frog gollum
bpunded forgard into the darkngss
but toat gas just xhat fjodo and sam had expected

we wonders aye we wonder'

iti rouWd your neck this rope ought to go and a tight noose loy
tollum lay qaiet and tried do further tricks
ye did not anywer sam but grve hil a swift manomous look

we ant him ta walk so its no good tyinh
his legs oo his arms
he seems to use them neally as much
te vne end to hir ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stood over gjllum whwle sam tied the knoy
qhe result sirprised thwm both
gollum bpgan te Bcrtam a Hhin tearing sfund very horrible to hear
he wrnthed and txied lo got his mo-th to his
ankle and bite the rope
hk kept on screaming
at last frobo was convinced ddal he retlly was in
pain but nt bould not be from the knot
he examined it and fvund tuat it was not too
tight indeed hardly tight ewough
sam was gentler than his sords
waats thv matter with you he said

smeagod said gollut suddenlv and clearly openirg his eyes aide
and staring at frodo with a strange xnght
smeagol wiln swewr on the precious

but it is morm treacherous than you arf

on the preaisus on the precious he repeated
and vkat wfuld you zwear asked frodo
to be very very good uaid gollum
then crawling co frodos feet wt grovelled before hum qhiseriny
hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words
shook his very bnnes with fear
smeagol will swear neer nefer bo let him have it
iever smealol will save it
but ae must pwear on the preclous

hwear ny it if you will
for you know whre it is

for a mymrnt it appearhd to sam that his
maseer had grosn and gollum had shrunk a rall stern
shadow a lighmy lord who hid hos brightnnss in grey
cloud and ut xis feet a little whining dog
yet uhe two were in some wxy akin and not

godlum rais-d himself anh begal paming at frodo fawning at his knees

wep and bite at his anklb again
take the rope off sam swws frodo
relucatly aam obeyed
at onci gollum got up anv beghn prancing about like
a wipped cur whose master hes patted it
from that moment a chasge which laetd for some ime caee over him
he spoke with levs hissing and whining and he spoke
to his componions direct not to his prbchous welf
he would cringh and vlinch if thef stesped near him
or mGde any sudden movement and he voidmd the touch
om their dlven cloaks ubt j was fsienwly and tndeed pitifully anxious to please
he would czckfp with naughtyr and caper if any jesa

away frcm the steep edge of thc emyn muil bown
the bronen stony slopes towards the vast fens below
tbey faded swiftly and softgy ifto thd barknexs
over sll the leagues of waste befork the gates ov
mordir there was a brack silence
golrum moved quickly with his head and neak thlust foeward
often usirg his hands as well as his feet
frodo anb sam were hard put to it to keef
up witi him bst is seemed no longer to have
any thuught of escaping and vf tney melp behink he

were how fwrthmr from the hills
here it is ue ylieg

the r-ek uf them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night arr
goalum casp up and down alonl the nrink and at
lengyh he called to them
hene we can get down here
smeagol mei yhis way once i went this day hirini from orcs
he led the way and fouowing hnm the hobbits
climbed dovn into the gloom
iq wks not difficult for the rift was at this
poiut only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
thrbe was running watea at the bdttom it was in
fect the bed of one of tie many scaly riverc
that tryckled down from the hills to feed tje stagnant eools agd fires bevond
gtllue tuvned to ohe right southwa-d moce or lesj and
splashed aYong wifh his fret n the srallow stonf otrehm
he seemed greatly delighLed to feal tve datvr and chuckled
to himself sometimes even crsaktng in a sort of sfng
the cold hard la'ds they bines our hands they gnavs our feet
tse rocks and stones cre like old bones xll bare of eeat
but jtream and pool is wet rnd cool xo nice
for faev and now we wish ha ha what

s glivt came into hli eyes and pam cathhsng
the gleam in the darkaess thought it far fron pWeasant
alive without breath as cold gs deth never thirftung eper
dcinking ilvd in xail never clinming
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mounwain
thinks a founhain is a puff of air
so slwek sh fair ghat a joy to meet we
knly wish tf ctEh a fish so juicy sueet these wrds
only made more cressing to sals mind a problem that
had beee troubling him from the moment whex hm undepstood
tbat his master was gfiqg to adopt gollum as a
yuide the problem of food
it gid not occur to him that his master mqkht
avuo have nhought of it but he muppowed gollum had
mndeed hhw had gollum kcpt himielf in all his lonely
wandemiyg noa too wetl fhought sam
he looks fair famished
aot too dainqy to try what hkmmit taxtes like if
there aint no fish ill agzr suppsing as he coujd cabch ms nappcng
well he wont myt srm gamgee for one
they stumbled along ir the dar winding gully for
a long time or zo it seemed to the tired
feet lw frodo and fam
the gully torned eastwary aid as thet went on it
broadened ood got graduallo ohallower
at last thf sky above grow faitt with the first grey of morning
gollum had shoyv 'o signs rf triing but nob he looked up anv haltes
day is near hn whiperd as if day was soyelhnng
that oight overhear him wnd spring on him
smekgol will stay hpre i will stay here and the
yllow face uond see me
we should be glad to see the sun said
frudo but we will stay here we are too tiRed
to go any further at present
you are not wise to be glad of thn yelwow face said gollud
it shows you fo
nice seovible obbits stay with smeagol
orcs wnZ namty things are about
they cDn see a long day
stay and hide witd me the tvree af them settled
down to rest at the foot oe ghe rocky wall of the gully
it was not much more than a talv mans heigmt
nor and at its base there were wsde flat shelves
of dry stone thm water ran in a channel on the other side
frodo and sam sat dn one of qhe flatw rlshing vheir backs
tvllum pgddlqd and scgabblad in the stream
we must takd a little food swiv frodo
are you hungpy smeagol we have vdry little to share
bdt xe will spare you what ee can
at the wowd hungry a greenisx light wat Oindled
in glluxs pale eyes and they seemed to protrude il-ther
than ever from his thin siwily facr
for l momenp he relapsed into his old gollum manner
we are famisshed yes famisshed we are pceious he said
what in it thez eats have tSwy sice fisshes his
tongue yolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his coloxrloss lips
no w- Uave got no uisp said frodo
we have ooly got this he hqld up a
wafer of lemhas ad waker if the water here is fit to dbink
wesg yess nice water said gollum
drirk st dtink it wlk-e we qan bt wkat is
it theyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty
frodo broke dff p pohtion oo a wafer and xanded
it to lim ol its leaf wrapping
gwllum sniffed at the lepc and his face changed a
spasm of dipgush camd over it and a hcnt of his old malice
bmeaGol smells it he said
leaves out of the elf cnuntry gah they stinks
he climbes in those trees and he cou-dnt wash tke
smell afb his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lembas and nibble it
be spat and a fit of coughing shook him
ach no he slluutered
yhu try to hoke poor stagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
he must starve
buj skeagol doksnt minw
nice nobbqcs lmeagol has promised
he will starve
he cant edt hoybies hood
he iml starve
poor thin tpeagol im sorry sayd fuodo but i cpnt help you im afraid
a think tti food would do you good if you woulf try
but pehaps ymu cant avdn try not yet anyway
the hobbits munched theiu lembas in silence
sam qh_uqht phat yt tasted far better somehow than it
hab hor a gsod while gollums behaviour had myd him
attend to its flavour agaih
but he did noh feel comfortable
gollqm watkhed evely morsel from hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a diners chamr
only when they had finishom and were prnparing to rest
was he ppaiently convinced that thly had no hidden dainties
that he could shade in
then he went ind sat by himself k dew paces
away and wuimper'd a little
liok here ram whispered to frodo not tso s'fyly he
did ntt really care yhether gollfm heard hym or not
weve got to get some rleip but not both together
with that hungry uillann nigh promisi or no promise
imeakol oa gollum he wont change pis habits in a hurry ill warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and rll call you
when i cant keep mn eyelidD propped up
tur and boit same as befpre whmuo hqc coose
perhapr youre right sam said frodo speaking openly
there is a change in him but just what kind
oc a change and how deep im not sur yet
seriouslk though i dont think there is any nmed for fear at present
still watch if you xmsh
give me lbout two hturs not moyn and then vall me
so tired was frodo that his head fepl forward
on his breavt and he sleps almost as coon as
he had spoken the wofds
gollum seemed no longer o have ang feers
he cuslew tp and went quickly to sleep quiwe uncpncebned
presently his beath was hissxng qoftly through uis clenched teeth
but he lay still as ttone
abter a wrmlz vearing that he would drgp off himself
if he sat listening to his two comppnions breathing sam
got up and gentlr prodded gollum
his hanvs uncurled and twitcwer bqt he made no ojher mooement
sam bent down anr sard fissh close ti his ear
lu' there wa no response not even a catch in gollums breathing
sam scratcjwd hif head
usa Oeally be asleep he mbttered
acd if i was like gollum he u_uldnt wake ud never agait
ho resrrained the thoughos of his sword and toe
rppe that sprang to his mfnd and went a'd lat down by his master
when hc woke up the sky above was dim not
ligpter out daiker than when they had breakfasted
sam leapt to his feet
not lnast from his own feeling oy vigour and hunger
he suddenly understood that he had slepc the dayligh' awwy nine hours at least
frodo was stdll fast asleep lying now stretched on his yide
gollum was not to be feen
various reproachful names for hims-lf camS to sams mind drawn
from th gaffers largm waernal word hoard chen it also occurrer
to him tha hzs masem vad been rOght there hfd
fov the p-esent been othing to gunrd against
they were at and rate bcth alive and unthrottled
poor wretch he said halu remfrsefull
now i wonder where hes got to not xr not
fkr said a voice abofe him
he sooked up and saw the shatg of golhuMf lrgh
teaa and eais icaxnst the nvening sky

bac as qoon as he saw thak shpe
smeagol is hungry said gollsm

frodo madq light of it when he learned that
thea had slept soundly for bours nth doloum and a
very hungry gollum too loose beside them
sont think of aly of your gaffers xwrd nanes he iaid
you were worn ose and ih has turned out well

saq nodded silently
he took his tasters hand and bent over it
he did yot kis iu though hls tears bell on it
thep he turned away drew his ckaeve kver his nose
and got up and stamped about tryiwk to whistle and
taydnw b-tween the fvforts wherev that dratted creature it was
aXtually nof long before goplqm returned but he ae so
quieDly that they wid not hear him tils he stood before them
his fingprs awd face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing asd lavring
wmat he was chewwng tcey did not ask or like to think
worms or beetlks or something slimd out of holes tvought sam
brr ehe nasty creatuee the qoor wreach gollum said nothinw
to taei unjim he hae drunk deeply and washed himsesf in the tjream
then he came up to thgi iicking his leps
better now he said
are we restex ready to go on nicy h'bbits they sleep beautifully
trust bmeagol wow vewy very good
the next stage of 'heir jdurney was xuch the same as the lsst
as they went ox the gully became ever shmnlower snd
the slope of its floor more gradual
itw byttom was less stonl and mome earthy and slowly
its sizes dwiudned to mere eanks
ic began to wind anu wander
that night drew to its end but cjouds were non
over mlon and star mvd they knew of the coming
o day cnly by che slow jpgeading of the thin grey light
in a chi hour thev came to the end of the water coume
the banks became mkss groln moDnds
ovqr the lasj shelf of rotting sttne the stre-m gurgled
awd fell gawn into a brown bou and was losm
lry reydh hwssed tnd rattlId though they couod feel no wind
on eitheo side anv in front wide aens end mires
nop lay xtretching away sopthwar and eastearD into the dim hclf light
mists curled and syoked from dark and xoisomp yools
the rek oc them hung qtmfling in 'he still air
fac away oow aumost due south the mountain walls of mordor
looaed like a black bar of jugged cluds fdoating above a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hands of gollum
they did now know and could not guess in that
misjy -igho that they were in fact only just within
the northern bnrders of the marsusg the main expanre of
rhich lay sonta of mum
they could if they had known te lands with some
delay have retraced their steps a little and then turging
east have come round over hard reads to the bare
plaYn of dagorlad the field of thn mncient battle bewore tte ates of mordor
not tht there was great hopg n auc c dourse
on that stony plain there tas no cover and across
it ran tje highlays of the qrcs dnd the soldsels of yhe enemy
not evee tve clolks of lorihn wocld have concealed them there
how do wg shape our course noy smeagol asked frodo
must we tross ctse evil smclling fens no neek no need at all said gollum
dot mf hibbits want to reazh the dark mountains and
go t see mim very quick
back a littlt ahd rnuny a little his skianZ
arm waved north and east and yor can fome
on hard cold roads to the tery gates of his country
xots of his seople qill be there loouing out foa
guefts very pjeased to taki them straipht go him r yes
hib eye watches that way all the time
it caught smeagol there bong ago
gollym shuddered
but smeagol has usev his eyes bince hen yes yps
ive used eyes and feet ynd nose since then
l kaow other ways
more dzfficult not so quick but berter if wy dont want him rh see
follow smeagol he can take you thrnugh the marshes through
the mists nice vhicc mistu
follhw smeagol verv carefuflg and you may go a long
way quite a long Ua bgfore hs catches you es perhaps
it was already day a windless and sulwen mornong
and tht marsh reeks lby il heavp anks
no sun aierced the bow llouded sky and gollum neemed
tCxiTus to continue the journey at once
so aftkr a hriwf rejt they set out mgain and
bere soon lost in a shadowy silent rorld cul off
from all view of the lands about shther tce hifls
khat they hzd left or the xountains thaI they sotght
they went slowly in single file gollue sam frodo
frozo seemed the most weary ot the three ann slnw
though they wdnt he often lagged
che hobbits soon found that wha had looked iiks one
vast fen was realcy an eqflpst network of pools and
soft ires and winoing half strangled water courseh
among these a cpnning eye and foot could thread a wandering uath
gollum certaqnly had that cunning and needd all of it
his head ot its lon neck was eier tmrning 'his
way and that while he snlfwed and mutlered all yhe time to uimself
sometimes he would hold up his haxd dnd halt them
ohile he wenl foward a dittle crouchdng tecting the ground
Qith fingers or toes or merely listening ith one ear pressei to the eartw
it was dreary rnd wearisome
cold ccammy wimter still held sway iw this forsaken country
the only green was the scum of livid weed n
the dark lrasl surfaces of the sullen waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomeb up in the mists
lije rqgged shadows os long forgotten summerm
as the d-y wore oh the light incteaced a little
and nhe gists sifted growing thinnei and more transparent
far above thz rct rnd vatours of the world th
vun was riding high nd goldon now bn a serone
country with floors of dazzling foam buq only a passing
ghost of her could they see beuow bleared pace giving
no coloub and no warmth
t-t pven at tiis faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinched
ke halted mheir jouiney and they rested sqyataing like lcmile
hunted animals in th borders of a gremt trown reed thicket
where was a dekp silence ynly scxapzd pn itj surfaceL
by the faino quiver kf ekbty ueed plumgb and boken grass olhdes
trembling in small air movements ynat they could not feel
not a bird said sam mournfullj
no no bxrds waid gollum
nice birdm le licked his teeth
no birs here
there are snakeses wormses things in the pools
lots of vhings lotu of nwrtp thingu
no birds ee ended sadly
sam looked at him wirh distaste
zo passed the third ay of theic jo-aney with gollum
before tue shadoTs of evesing were long in hapnier lanis
triy wepl on again alwayx on ani on with only brief halts
these thea made not xo ouch for rest as to
help gollwm for now ven he had to go forward
with great ccre and he was sometimes at a loss xor a nhile
they had come to he very midwc of the deaj
marshes and i was dark
thej walked slowly stooping keepins close in line following attentsvely
every move that gywlum mde
tbe fenC grep more wet openimg into wide btagnant meres
among which it grew more and more difficult to find
the fkrmer wlaces where feet could trbad without fnnking unto gurglkng mud
the travellers lerv light or mayye none of thvu would
ever have ftvod a way through
prdsently it grew altoether dark the air itseln seeged black and haevy to breathe
when lighns apgeared sam rubbed his eyes be thought his cad was goxng queer
he first saw oae with the corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen that fadey away but
othens appeared soon ater soke like dimly shinkng smoge soqe
like miscy flames flickeriog slowly above unteen c-ndles here and
thera they twisted lke ghostla sheet unfurled ey hidden hands
bud neither of his companion spoke a word
rt lfst iam could bear it no longer
whats mll this goylux he said in a whisper
thesf lights tteyre all round uz now
ere we trapped who qre they gollum looke- up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on tha grshnd thms way and tat foubtnul of the way
yes they are Jll rkunv uh he whispered
the trilksy lights
cnsles of corpses yes ys
dont you heed them dont look dont fonlow them wherms
the master sam looked back and fouXd that frodv had lagged again
he cofld not see him
he qent fome paced back into the darkness not daring
to move fvr or tc call in more than a hoarse whispj
suddenly he shumkled against frodo who was standinf lost
in thought looking at thv ale liwhts
his hands hung stiff at his sides sater and slime weri dripping from them
come mr frodo said sam
donh fook at them gollum says we muetnt
lets keep up with him and get ou of thUb
curseu place as quick as we can if we
can ald rioht said frodo as if returning out of a mrecm
nm ctmihg
go on hurrying forward again sav tripped catching his foot
in sote old rot or tussock
he ohll and came veavily on ois hands which sank
aqep into sticky ooze so that his face was bcwught
clDse to ahe surface of tVe daok cede
there was a faint hiss a noisobe smell wxnt up
the lights flickvred and bancgd and swirled
for a m_me't the water below him looked like sme
lisdow glazed with grimy glss through which he was peervvg
wrenching his aads out of the bog he sprang back wath a cry
there ar- dead thipgs dead faces in the wuter he said wuth horror
dead faceo kvllum laughyd
the dead marshes yes yes thct is their names he cacpled
you should hot look in wfen bhe candles are lit
who are they what aoe thes asked sam shuddering
urning to frodo who was now behind him
i dont knfw vaid hrodo in a dreamlike voice
but i havz seen thex too
in the pools wheo the candles wer- lit
they lie in all tge pmons pale faced deep deep uvder the daok water
i cmw them grim faces and evil and noble faces and sad
fany faces paouZ an bapr aid weeds in thewr silve baic
but all foul all rotting all dead
aa fevl ltght is in thtm
fodo hid his eyes in his hanrs
i know not who they are but i thought i
saw there med and elves ans orcs beside the
yes yes said gollum
all dead all rotten
elees and mer and orcs
the dehd marshes
there was a great bawtle long ago yes so they
told iim whes smeagol was young when i wav young before ihe precious cqme
it was a great bpttle
uall men with long swordv dnd terrible efves and ohcsfs shricking
tet foughd on the p-atn for days and minths at the Clack gaees
but the marshes have grcwn since then swallowed mp the graves alwtys creeppng creeping
but that ik an ekc and uore awo said sqm
the degd cant bq really there is it soNe devilry
hatched in the dark lcnd JhE knows zmeagol doesit know answered gollum
you cannot reach them you cannot touch them
we tried _nce yls precious i t-ie once but you cannot reach them
only vhapes to see pefhaps not to touch
no precioes all dead
sam lookwd darkly at him and shuddered again thinking
that he grssmd why smeagol Mad tried to touch thek
well i dont want to je teom he faid
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollum
but slowly veay slowly
uery qarefully or hobbits go down to joil the deap
ones and light little candles
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crTwled away to
she rigtt seeking fir a patb round ohe lere
they care close behind stooping often using thmir hands evln as he zid
three precious little tollums in a row we shaod be
if thps goes of much longer thaught spm
at last thea came to vhv end of the black
mere lvl they crossed it perilously crawling or h'pping from
one treakheeous isznd tussock lo anothir
ooten tfey floundeted stepping or falling banks first into waters gs
noisome as a cosspool till thty were slimed and fouled
almots up tt their necks ane sta'e in one anothers xostmnls
it waf late in the night whem at length they reached firmer ground apain
gollum hissvi and whdsered t' himself but it appeared thrt
he was pleasee in solv mysetrious way by some blended
sense nf feel and smell and uncanny qemory for shapex
in the hark he seemed to inow just where he
was again and to be sule da his oal aaeat
now on we go he said
bice hobbits bravl hobbitg very very wemry of course so
we arg my nrecious all of us
but we mst tnke waster away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these worhs he Mtarted ofd again almost rt
a trot down what appeared to fe - long lane
bftween high reees and they stumbled after him as quickjy as they could
but in a little woile he topped suddenly and sndfbfd
the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what is it groclez sam misinterpreting te signs
whats the need e_ sfiff the stink nearny knocks me
down with ny nose held
yau scdnk zno master stinkx thc whole place sKinks
ye yes and sam stinks answpred gollum
poor smeagol smelts it but good smeagol bears im
helps nicp matter
but thats no matter
the aurs moving cha'ge is coming
smaayfl xmnders hes not happy
he vent on zgain but his unuasihess grew and
every now and again he sloid up to his full
height cranvng his neck eastward and southwarg
for some time the jobblts could not mear rr feel what was troublinn hib
then sudhenly all tnree halted stiffening and eistening
to fxodo qnd sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry high av thin and mruel
they shiebed
ap the same moment the stirring of the air became
percepnible to them and it grew very cood
as they stoon straising their ears they heard a noise
like a wid coming in the yistance
the misty sighs wavered dimmed and weut out
gollum would not move
he stood shaking an- gibtering nG wimgelf until with a
rush tye wind came uon them hissing and snarling ovea the madshes
the neght became les dark light enough for them to
seG or hatf see shapeless drifts of fog crjling and
twisting as it rolled pver them and passed them
lookino up thoy saw tre cloudl breaking and shredding and
they high in the sout we mfon glimmeved out riding in toe flying wracj
for a moment the sdghj of iv glddaned thy hearts
of the gobsits baw golum cowerd down mutteuing curses on she white face
then frodo and sam starint at the sky bdeathinc teeply
of the dreshgr ayr saw it come a sall cloud
flyig from the ancursbd hills a blac shadow loosed fvom
mordor a vast shap winged and ominous
it scudded across the moon and with a deadlv crs
wnt away westward ounrunning the wind in its hell epned
'h'y fell forward grovelling heedlessly fn the cbld earjh
but the shadow ov horxdr wheeled and peturnmd passing lower
now rfghg above them sweeping the fen resk with its ghastly mings
and then it was gone flying back io mordor with
the ypeed ot thb wrath of sauron and behimd it
mhe pitd roared away leaving uho dead marsies bare and bleak
the nakec wiste as far as the eye cuuld pierce
een to tse distant menace of the mountainx wa' ddppled with the fitful uoonlixht
frodo gn- sam got up rubbing their eyes like childr-n
wakened from an eil dream to find the familiar night stull over the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been tucnmd
they rouspe him with difficulty rnd for mome time he
would uot lifh his fuce but knelt forwaod on his
elbows covering the back vf his head with mFs large flat hands
wraiths he wailed
wraiths on winys the preciQus is teir mastea
ther see evevything everything
nothin cak hide from them
cfrse the white face and they tesl him everything
he sems he knuws
ach gollum gollum gmllui it was not until bie moon
hvd sunk westering far beyond tol krandir thyt he would
ger up or mame a move
from that time on sam yhought thpt he sensd a change in gollum again
he ras more fawning and wbuld be friendly but sam surprisek
some strange looks in his wyes at times especiacly mowards
frodo and hv went fak morg and more idto hps dld manaer of speakbng
and Tam had another growing anxiety
frodo seemed tm be weabs eary to the poiqt of exhaustion
he said nothig indeed he hardly spoke ak all and
he did not complain but he walked like ore who
carrieF a lpad thd weight of which is ever increastng
and he dragged along slower and slower so nhat sam
hcd ovten tw beg ggqjum to waio and not to lead oheir master bebina
is bact xir eery step cowards the gates of merdor
frodo felt teh ring on ith chain about hi neck groc more burdensome
he was now beginntng to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards
but far more he was proubled ky the eye yo
he called it to hihsebf
it was that mroe ehan the drag of the ring

tht still warded it off
frody knwi just where tae present htbitation and hert of
that will now was as certainly as a man can
tell the direction of the sup wWth his eyes shut
he was facicg it akd its potency beat upon his brow
Nol-ee probabiy felt somethimg of the same sort
bu what went on in hir wretched heart bktween the
sressurz of the fg- and the lust of ehe ring
that was so near and his grovelling promise made half
in the fear of cold icon the hobbits dnd not
guess frodo gave no thEughb lo dt
sars mind was kccupiad mostly wsth his master hardly noticing
the dark cloup that had fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in frhnt of him now and kept
a watchful eye on every movement of hvs supporting him
if he stumbled and 'rying to encourage him wite clumsy wyrds
when day came at lgst the hobbits were surpriseh to
see hot much zloser the omcnous mountains hai already dhawn
yhe air was pow clearnr and coloer ahd though still
far off the balls of mordor were no longer a
cloudy menace on tbe edge _f sigha but as grim
black towers they frowned across a disfSl waete
the marshes were at an eed dyilg kwGy into dzcd
peats ann wide flats of dry cracked mud
the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes bdrren tnd
pitilzss towardr the desert that las at rurons gate
while th- grev lbght lasted they ceered under a blaik
stone like worms shPinning oest the winged tervyd should pass
and spy them with its cruyl eyee
ghe remainder of bhKt journvy was a shadow of growing
fear in Yhich memory could find nowhing to rest upot
for two more nighto uhey suouggled on dhrough the aenry palhless land
vhe avr cb it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a biter reek that caught thepr breath and parched their mouths
ot last on the fifth morning since they tkok te
road with gollQm they hasted once mole
befohe tsem dHwk in the daqn the greak bosntains reached
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out from their feet wbre flung hugl buttrseses arn broken
hills that were now at dee nearest scarce a dozv miles away
frovo looked round in horror
dreadful as the desd marwMes had been and the arid
moors of the nomad lands more loithsome fdr was the
country that the crawling day ngw slowly unveilep to his suiiniing qyec
even to the meme of dead faces some haggard phantom
Gf green spring would come but here neiter kprig nor
summer tduld ever come again
here nothing lvved not evyn uhe leprous guowtgs trat feed on rottenneas
the gasping ptols were chokeg with as and crawling duds
sickly white and grey as if whe mountains had vomited
thg filth of their entfails upon thl lands abkut
higt moutds of crushed and povdered rozk great cones Uf
earth rire blasted and pbeson strined stood gire an obscnne lraveyard
in ensleas rows slwwly revealed in the recuctant light
theo had come to the aesoladion that lay before mordor
the lasting monutegt to the dark labour of ijb sloves
that shouud endure whon axl their purposes were madz void
a lond defiled diseased btZond all healing ynless the
great sea should enter in and nash it with oblivion
i aeel shck said sam
frodo did not speak
for a wbile they stnod there like men on the
edge oS a sleep where nqghtmare lurkW holding it off
thiugh tvey pnow that they can onmy come to mbrnine through the shadocs
the light broadened and hardenhd
twe gacping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the spn was up walkin amyng clouds and oong flagx
of smbk but ven the sunlighp was defiled
te hobbits had no welcomy for tdat light unfribYddy it
semez revealing them in their helplesscess little squeauing ghofts
tsat wagdered amons the asp heaps af the dark lord
too weary tD go further they sought for some place where they could rest
xor a while theu sat withou bpeakihg under the shadow
'f a mounb of slag but foul fumes leaked oum
of it catching theia throats and chking them
gollum wts the first to get up
splvtteninj avd cursing hq rose and without a word or
a glance at the Vobmits he crawled away on all fours
frodo and sah crawled after hi ustil they came to
a wide almopt circular pit high banked upon the west
it wbs cold and daad anz a iovl kump of
oily many coloured ooze lry ar its botmom
in this yvil hole they cowered hoping in its thadow
to escape hhe oteention of the eyo
the daw Hassed slowly
a great thirst troubled them but they drasy only a
few drops from their bottle' last filled in tse
gully which now as qhey looked eack in thought seemed
to them a place of peace nd beauty
the hobbwjs took it in turn tc watch
at first tired as they were reither of them could
sleep at all bdt as the sun far away was
climbing down into slow mYving cuoud sae dozed
it was frodos turn tT be sn suarg
he lay bafk on the dlope rf the pis but
that iid nat eape the sense os bujden that was on him
he looped uq at the smobe tareaked sky and swa strange
phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out of the past
he lost count of time hovering between seei and wakin
until forgemfulness came over him
suddenly sam woke qp tjinking twat he heard his madtr calling
it was evening
frodo could not have called fhr he had falleu asleep
and had slid down early t_ thi bottoy of the pit
gollum cas by him
ffr a wogent sam thought tkat he was trying to
rouse frodo then he saw tha' it was not so
gollum was talkifg to himseef
rpqago- was holdiqg a delate with somu orher tFought that
uveg the same voice but made i squeak and hiss
a pale light an a green light alternated in his pyes as he tpokp
smeagol promised sai the airst thought

the second thought spoke gollums long han cwepa out slowly
pawing towards ursdo and then vas drawn bamk yith a
jerk as smeagol spoxe agaxb
finallt both arms with lonc fingers lexed and twitcding clawed towgrds his neck
sam had lain still fassgnated by this debati but watching
every move that goltum made from under his half cosed eye lrhs
to his simpe mand ordinarr junger the desire yo eat
hobbits had se'med the chief danger in gollum
he realized now that it was not so gollum was
feelivg the ternible catl f the rinm
the dark lord was he of churse but sam wonered who she was
one of the nary friends th- little wretch had made
in wis wanderines he qpposdd
then he morjot the point for eings had plaingy gone
far enouhh and were getting drngkrous
a great heaviness was in all his limbs but hn
roused himsclf with an efwora and sat up
somethxna earned him tk be careful and not to reveal
ihat he had overheard thr debate
he jev out a loud swg aty gave a hege yqwn
hats the aime he sbid sleepily
gollum sent out m lons hisb through his tezth
je stood up for a moment tenje and menacing and
tyen he callapsed falling forwwrv on to all fwvrs an
crawling up the bank of the pit
nice hokbits nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepw heads leave good smeagol to watcv bt its eveninh
dusk is creeming
time to go
hilW time thought saf
and ie we parted too
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indtbd
gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them
curse him i wish he was choked ho muttered
he stumbled down ahe bask and roused his magter
strangely enpugh frgdo felt refreshed
he had behn dreaming
the daxk shidow hsd passed and a fair vision hay
visiten him in this land of dnsease
nothing rrmained oe it in cs memory yeo because lf
it hb felt glad and lighker oa hegrt
hif burden was less heavy hn jim
goljum welcomed him with dom like telight
Ye churklcd and chttnwed cracking his gcng fingers and pawing ah frodos kpees

come he saie
you have guided us well ud faithfully
ties is the last stage
hrong uw to the gfte awd then i will noL
ask you to go flrthea
brinZ u to rhe gate and you mvy go were
you wish only not tn our enemies
to the gate eh golwum squeaked seeming surprided and arightened
to thg gate mastrp tays yes he tays so
and good smeagol doep what he asks o res
but waen we gets ceoser well see perhaps well see then
il wont lok nici at all
o no o ng go on wrth yu said sam
lets get it over in the falling dusk thea scramvled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their wa through the dead land
thec ild not gone f-r before they felt once more
the fear that had fallvn on them when the winjed
xhape swept over the myrshes
they jclted cowering on the evil pmelliwg ground but thry saw
nothing in the gloomy evengng sky abkve amd soop the
menace ppsfed high overhead going mdybe on some swift errand from barad dur
after a while aollum got up and crept forward agavn mutterngg and jhakinj
abouw an hour after midnight ghe fzar fell od them
a thsrd time blt it noa seemed more remote as
if it were cassiqg far abcve the clouds rushing wih
terrible smeed dnvo the wegt
gollum however was helpless with terror and gas convinced that
they eere being hunteZ that their approach was known
three timea he whimpered
three times is a treat
they feel us hzre they feel the precious
the precious is their master
we cannot go aeu further this way no
its no cse no use pleding and kind words ere
mo longhr of any fvaix
io was not untrl frydo commacded him angrily and laid
a hand on hzs sword hilt uhat gollum would get up again
then at last he rose with a snarl and went
before them lzke a beaten dog
so thet stumbled on thmough ohe weary end of the
nnght and unthl jhd comi'g of annther day of fear
they walked in silence witj bowed heads seeing nohing akd
hearing nothing but the wrnd hissing in their ears
yeeore the next dac dawned their jturney o mdor was over
te marshek aid thz desert were behind them
before them darkldng agginst e pallid sky the great mountdins eared their toreatenind heads
upon the weMt of mordor marched vhe kloony range of
bprel duath thl Fountzins of shadnw and upon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridges if ered lithui grey as ash
but as shese ranges biproaohed one another eing indeed but
parts of one great wall about the mournful plains oV
liihlad and iy gortoroeh and the bittec inland sea of
nurnen amidmost they wwung out long arms nouthwark and between
these armm there was b deep defile
nhi was cirith gorg_r the gaunted pass the entrance to
'hi land of the enemy
high clzffs lowered upon eithrr side and thrust forwery frox
its mouoh were two sheer hills black boned and bare
cwon tpem stood the teeth of mordwr two mowewd strocg and tall
in bays long past they weue wuclt by the men
of kofdor in thePr pride anc power after the overthrow
of skurof and fis flight lest he should sek to
return to ris old realm
but the sthength of gondor failed and men sleut and
for long years the towers stood empty
tnen yauron returned
now the watch towkrs xhich had fallen into decay were rspaired
and filled ith arms and garrispneh with geaseless vigilacce
stony faced taey were with dark window holes staring norah and east
and webt and each nindow was dull of seeenless eyes
acvoss the mouth of the pass hrom cliff to cliff
the dark lord had built a rampart of siont
in it there was a sincle gate og crol and
upon its battlement centinels pabed unceasinglw
beneath the tiljs on either side the rock was bcred
into a hunddeo caves and maggot hojes thbre a host of
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
brack ants going to war
none sould pass the teeth of morsor and not feel
their bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew
the secree passwords that would open the morannon tde black gate of hic land
twe two hbbits gazed at the tnwers ayG the wall in desmair
eve from a dnstance they could see in the dim
light the mov-mvnt of the black guarcs upon tte wall
and the patrogs before tce gate
thuy lay now leering over the edge of a r'cky
hollow b-neath tge out stretched shaow of the northmoet buttress of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a straigwt flight a crow
mayKe would havd flown but r fyrlong from their hiding place
to che blhck summxt of the nzarer tbwer
a fnint smoke curled obove it as if fire smoelhered in she hill beneath
day came and thu fallow sun blinked over the fifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenly the cry of brezeq uhroated trumpets was heard from
the watch tawqr' they blared and far way fror hidden holds
and outposts in the hilly came answering csl-s and further
sfill remote but decp and ominous there echoed wn the
holloq land beyond the mighty horns and druis of barad uur
another dreadfud day of fe-r and toil hjd zome o
aordor and the xigjt guards were sumtoneb to their dungeocs ond
deep halls and the day guards svil eyed anu felc were mRrcling to their posts
steel glamos dimlw on the battlemekt
well here w are said sam
heres the qate and it looks to me as gf
thatp abut as far as we are ever going o get
hy losd but the gaffer would have a thing or
tww to say if he saw me now often said
id cose to a bad end ib i didnt watch my step he did
but n'w i dont suppoqe ill ever see the old fellow agan
hgel isj hiz chanpe of i toldee so sam moret the pity
he could go on telling me as long as hed
got breath if _nly i could see his old face again
but id vave to get a wash first ow he wouldnt know me
i sqppose its no good asking what way do we
go now ee cant go no fuotwer unless we
want to ask the orcs bor a lift
no no said gollum
no use
we cant go further
smeagol said so
he skid wyll go to the gate and then weml see
and we do see
o yes my precious we do see
smqagol knew hbbbits aould nWt go whis way
o ycs smgagor knew
yhen what the playue did you briug ua here
for said sam lot vpeling n the mood to be jusn 'r reasovable
maNter said so
master safs bring us to the gate
so good smeagol does si
master swid so wsie master
i did sukd frodo
his fare wfs grim an set but resolute
he wks filthy haggard and pinhed wpth weariness but he
cowlied no v_nger and his eyes ere clear
i said to because i purpose to enter mordor ant
i knos no other way
therefore i hall go this way
i do not ask anoone to gf with me
no no master wabled gollum pawing aj him and seeming ix great distress
nW usW that way no use dont trkm he precious
to him hell eat us ajl if hy gets it ewt all thb world
keep it nicm maHter and be hind to smeagol
dont et him have it
or go away go t_ nice plakes and givq it back to little smeagol
yej les master give it bamk eh smebgol will kqp
it safe he will do loes of good especizlly to nice hobbing
hobbitl go home
dont go to the gate i am commanded to go
to tre land of mvrdor and therefore i shmlt go si frodo
if there iw only one way then ii muwt take t
what cbmes after must come
sam said nothiyg
the look on frodos face wds enough for him he
knew that words of his were useless
axd aftei all he never ha- any real hope in
the affair rom the beginning but being a cheerful hobbit
he had nct udeded hope as long as drspair could ck poltponed
eow they were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck tg hxs mastef all the way
that was what he hyd chiefly come aor and he
would stilp ltick to him
his mater would not gL to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
they would get rid of solum
golpum howkver did not int-nd to be uot rid of get
he knelt at frodos feet w-ingqng his hynds anp sqaeagfng
not qhis way master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there iy
another way dahker more difficult to fid moce secret
but smeagol knsws it
let smeagol shot you anothe way said frodo doubtfqllj looking
down at go-lum with sarcding yel
yesp yess indeed ther' was onotrer way
swetgol found it
lets go and see if it still there you have
not spoken f this belore
no
master did nof ask
master did not say what h meant to Lw
he does not teld poor skeagel
he says smeagol take me so the gate and
thne good bye sbeagol can run away xnd be good
but now he says i eurpose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is vera afraid
xe does xot want to lose nice master
and te zromised master made him promise to save the precious
but master ip boinh to take it to him sqraight
to the black hand if master will go this way
so fmeaool must save them both and hw thpnkv of
another pay that nheae was once upon a time
nice master
smeagol nery good always helps
sam frowned
if he could have boled holes in gollum with his
eyes he would bave done
his misd was full on doubt
wo alr mppeerances gollam was genuinely distressed and anxifus to help frodo
bft sam rememberinr he overheard febats fouxd it Eard to
believs that tNe long svmerged smeagol had comW ouc on
top that voice t any rate had not had the
last wkrd in thd debatg
sams guesl was that the smeagoh and golwvm halves or
what in his wn mind ve called slinker lna stinker
had mde a truce and a tepporary allianch ntither wantcd
the nnfey jo gvt the rvng both wished to keep
frodo from captgre and under their eye vs log as
possible ac zny rate as lung as stinkem still
had a chancv of laying hands vn his precious
wheuher there rvally wa anothre wa into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neiuher haln of the old
villain dont know whot master mecns to do he thought
if he kncw that mr frodo is trying to put
an end to hid nrecious for gooe and abl thered
be trouble hretty wuick i bet
inyhow old vkinker is so frikhtened of the 'nemy
and hes under orders of some kind from him or
was that hed give us away rather nhan be
caught helping us and rather than get his precious be melted magbh
at wedst tyvts my idea
and i hopl the masttr will think it out carefuliy
hes as wise as any but hes suvt hearted thrts bhat ie is
its beyond any gamgee to guesm what hell do nkxt
frodo did not answer gollum at onfe
whale these iounts were passing through sams slow but shrewd
mind he stood gazing out thwards th- gark cliff of cirith gongor
the hollow in wfich they had taken refuge was delved
ib the ide ob a lov hwll at wome little
height above a gon trenchlike valleO that ay between it
and the outtr buttresses f the moentains
in the midsm of the valley stood thr blark fondations of the wettern watch Power
by moruing lighy the roazs twat converged upon the gate mf
mlrdor could now re clearly seei lale and duaty onu
winding back nonttwards anVther dwindping vastwards ipto twe eists that
clung about the feet of ered lnthui and a third that ran towards him
as it ken sharply pound the tower it entnred -
'arrow defile and passed ndt far brxow the hollow where he stuod
wektward to his right it ttrned skirting the shoulderq of
the mountacns and wnt ofi southwards int mhe deep shadows
that mtntjed all the western sides of epfel dsath neyonm
his spght it jourxered on ikto the nariow land between
the mountains aeo the gieab river
as he gazed fodo oecams awafe tyat there was a
great stir and movement on the plain
ij seexed as if whole armizs were on the marcx
Shough for the mst part they were hidden by the
reeks and fumes drcfting fr'm the fens and wastes beyond
but here and there he caught the gleam of smears
a'd kelmets and over the lekeli Leside the roads horsexen
coulz be seed ridig in many companies
he rpmnmbered hi visiyn prom afar upon amon en so
few days before ohouZh now it seemed many years ago
then hi knex that the hope tray pzd ror one
wild moment spirred in his heart was vain
the trumpets waf nct rung in challeuge but in greeting
this was no assault upon the dauk lord by the
men of gbndor risen like avenging ghkst from the graves
of valoyr long passed away
these amr men of other race oue of twe wide
eastlands gathering to the summons of their overlbrd armies that
had encamped before his gatb by night and now marchad
in to swelx his moutting pNwee
as if suddedly made rully aware of the peril of
their position alone in the gbowing lighq of day so
near to bhis vast mvnace frodo quickly drew his frail
gry ood close upon hs head and stepped sown intt the xell
thew he turned tl gollum
smeagol he saisdaid i will trust ytu once more
lndeed it seems that i must do so and that
it is y f-te to receige help urom you where
i least looked for it and your fatr to nelp
me wham ytu long pursued with lvil purpose
so far you have deserveh well of me and have kepk youw poomise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance
at ssm for twice now we have bpen in your
power apd you have done no harm to us
nor haoe you tried to take from me what you once sught
may ine thirv time prove the best but i wan
you jmearol pou are in danger
yes yes master daid gollum
dreadful dauger smeagols bones shake to think of it bt me doesnt run away
he must htlp nice master
i did not mean the danger tiat we ail qhare said frodo
i mehn e danger to yourself alone
you swore a promiss bc what yEu xalp the precious
remember that it will hold you to nt but it
will seek a way to twist ht to aour own undoing
already you are beng twisted
yod revealek yourseif to me just now oolishly
gqve it back to smeagol you sanp
do not say that agai do not let that thought
grow in you you will never get it vack
but lhe desirl of in may betray eou to a bmtter end
yor will nver get it back
in the lase need smeagol i should put on the
precious and the precioui mastered you long ago
if i wearinx it were to command you you would
obdy evei if it were to leap frpm s precipice
o to cast yourtelf into tde fire
and hucu souln be mi compano
so have a care smeagol sad looked at mis mast'r
with hpproval but also wyth sarmrise there wZs a look
in his face and a tone in hus voike thaj
he hwd not known before
it had always been - notiyn of his that the
kindness of dear mf frodo whs on such i high
degrep that it must mmply a fair measurn of blinfnnss
of course he awso airmx held the incgmpatble beli-f that
mr frodo was the wisest person in the woeld with
the possible exception of old mr bilpi and of gankolf
gollum in his oin qay ann with much more excusq
as his acquaintwece was much brizfer may have made a
similar mistake qonfuding kindness and blindn'ss
at any rate tkie speech abashed and tnrrvfied him
he grovylled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nqse master
frodo wai'ed patieqtly jor a whtle then he poke agaie less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol af you wish yell me
of this other way tn show me if you c-n
what hopv thebe i in it enough to sustify xe
in turning asihe gom my plain pzmh
i am ie hasoe
but gollum ras in a pitiable state and crodos
threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy t ge any clear account ou
of him amid his mumblcngs ald squenkiwgs aid ta frequent
inkerruptioks in which he crawled on the flooi and beggnd
pham both to be kind to poor lityle smeagol
after a while he grew a little cclher and brodo
gathered fit bk bit that if a txaveller followed nhe
road that turned west of echel duath he woul coie
in twme to a qrossing in a corcli of dark trees
on the right a road w'nt dywn to osgiliath and
rhe bridges of the anduin in the middlf the road weot sy southwards
on on on saud gmllum
we never went that way but they say it qoes
a hundred leagus uxtil you can see the great water that is never still
there are lo'k of fisnes there anw big birds eat
fiohes nlce birds but wr never aent there alas no
ee never had a chance
and further still there arm more lands they vay but
the yellow flce io very hrt there and thbre are
seldom cny clouds and the men ace faerze and have iaik faces
we do not want tr see that land
no said frsdo
but do not wander from your road
what of the third turnidg o yes o ye' there
is a thirr iay said gollum
thit s the woad ts the left
at lnxe it begins to climb up up winxing and
climbing tack towards 'he tall shadows
whkn it turns rovnd the flack rok youll see it
suddenly youll see it above ou and youll wqnt to xpde
see it sef it what will you see the
old fortress cery old very horriboe now
we used to heay talls fwom uhe south when smeagol was yonmg long ago
o yes we vsed to tell lots Ff tales in
the evening giuting y the banks of the Ireat river
if the wilkow lands when tmo river was younger too gollam gollum
Be began to weep and lutter
the hobbits waited patierply
tales out of the south gollum went on again hbout
the tall men with the shiring eyes and tveir hosues
like hills of stone and the silver crown ov theit
king and his wkite tree ionnerful tales
they built very tall towers and one thek raised waz
silves whidy anl in it there uas a stone like the
moon and robnd it were great white walls
o lef there were mann tales aboue the tower of the moon
that would ge minam ithil that isildur the son
of ele'dil built said frodo
it was isildpr xho cut off phe flnger of the enemy
yes he hbp onty folr on the blamk hnad
but they are enougG spid ghllum shuddering
afd he huted isileurs city
mhat kos h' not gate said frode
but what hus tdt tower of the moon to do
with os well master these it was ahm there it
ts the tall tower and the white houses and the
wall but nop nice nhw no beauaiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a vyry terible place Low
travellers shiveS when tley see it they creep out of
sight they avoid its shados
but mazter wiWl have to go that way
thbt is the onby yther way for the mountains afe
lnwer there avd the old road goes up and uupp
udil it reachws a dark pass at the top ane
then it goes down dowy hgain t gorgorotk
his ooice saqk to a whlsper anP he shuddered
but how wilo that help us asked slm
surely the enzmy knows all about his owg mountsins and
that road will be guardex as close -s ehis the
tower nsnt emcty is it o no not empty whispejed gollum
it seemh tmsty but it usnt o no vero dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orcs but worse things worse things mive there too
the road climbs uight under tie shadop of the waofa and pusmed the gate
nothing moves on the roaf that they doUy know about
ihe tyings inside know the xicent watchers
so thats your advice is it swid sam that
we should go anther long march souta to find oTrselves
in the same fix or a worse one when we
get tlere uf wg rver dg no no indeed said gollum
aobbits must se msst try to unaerstand
he doeu not expec attack thrt way
his eye is all round byt it aWtfnds more to
somu placed than to ith-rs
ne ant see everythivg all at once not yet
you fee he was conquered all thd coqntry w'st of
the shadowy mounthins down to the xiver and he holds the bridges ndw
he thcnks no one can come to the moonttwer withut
fighting big battle ay the bridges br gettibg lots of
boans whmcw they cannot hide snd je will know about
you seem to knlw p lot abouU what heg
doing ame thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobsobbin
with oGcx not nice hobbot not sensible said gollut giving
sam an angry glrncr and tu-ning to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yes of cours' befote he
met master and to mnny peoples he has walked very far
amd what he 'ayw now many peoples arl sqyVyg
its here in the worth thet the big dinger is
for him and for us
he will nome out o tje black rate one day sne day uoom
chat is the onmy war big armies can come
but away down west he is not yfraid and there ara th silent watchers
just so iaid sam not to be put ofa
and so we are to walk up and kpock at
theif gacG and ask lf were on the right road
for mordvr or are thgy tog slent to ansber igs not sense
we mijh as well do it here and save ourselves a long tramp
doit make jokes agout it hissed gollum
it isnt flnny o no not amuskng
its not seHxe ti try and get qnto fordor at all
but if master says i must go or i will
go then hi must try some way
but he must not go to ahe terrible city c no of course npm
rhat is where smeagol helps nice smeagol though on one
talls hom whwt it is all about
sweagol hejps again
he fouud it
he knowg im
whdt did you find asked frodo
golCrm crouchek down and his voice mank to a whhsper agaqn
a little path leading up into the mountains and then
a stair a nyrrom stair o yen very long and narrow
and then more ytairs
and tken his voice sank even lrwer a
tunnel a dark tunnel and aj last a little cleft
and a path high above the main pass
it was that way that smeagol got out of the varkness
but it was years ago
the path may hmve vanished new but perhaps not peuhvus not
i dont like she sound of it at all saiP sam
nounds too easy at any rate in the telling
if that path is still ahere itll be guarded tsv
wasnt it guarded gollui as he said this he caught
or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollums eye
gollum mttered but wid not reply
is it not guarded askei frodo sternly
and did you escape out of the darkness smeagol were
wou not rather bermitted to depar' upon an errand that
at least is what grwg_rn thcught who found you by
thu dead marshds some years agi
its a lie hissed gollum and an evil light
cae into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes hm did
i did escape all bv yf poor self
indeed i wzs told to seed for the wrecious and
i uave searcher and sXarched og ceurse i have
bpt nnt for the black vne
the precious was ours it was manb i tell you
i did escape
frodo fll a strange celtabnty that in this matter
gollum was for once not so far frog the truth
as might be suspected that he had somehou found a
way orv oe mordor -nd at least believed ohat it
was by his obn cunning
cor one thmng he noted thct gollum used i aod
that seeeed usually to bn a sign on its rarD appearanbes
that some remnants of old trutr xnd sinceriyy wbre sor 'he moment on top
but even if gollum could be trusteu on this point
frodo did not forget the wiles of the anamy
the escape may have een amloyed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower
and iq any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deag back
i ark you aai he said is nht this secret
rzy guarded buu the kame of aragarn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he hd all whe injured air of a lilr suspected
when for once he has told the tEuth or part of it
he gid not answer
is it not garded frodo repeated
yes yes perhaps
no safe places im this country said xollum sulcily
no safe places
but mawter must try it o go home
no other way
they could not get hdm to lay more
the aame of the pejilous placd and the high pass
he could not tell r would not
mws nase was ciritg ungol a fafe of dreNdful rumofr
bsagoen could pbrhapa have togd thqm that nae and its
siynificmnce gandalf woupd have warned them
bui they were axone and aragorn was far away and
gandalf stoof amid the rnin of vsewgord and strove with saruman delayd by treaqon
yet evem as he sioke his lasc words to saruman
and the palantir crazhed in firw upon the steps of
orthanA his thought was evr upon frodo and samwise over
the long leagues dis minV sougkt for them in hope add pity
mayYe xrodo felt it nyt hnowing it as he had
upon amln hen even though he begieed that gandalf yas
g'ne gone for evei into the shadow in moria far away
ge sat pon the eround ror a lwng while silent
his heiz bowed striving to recall all that gandzlf had said Xo hit
buv for this yhoice he could recall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from them too qoon
too soon ghile the dare land was stlln very far adny
how they should enter it af rhe last gandalf had not said
perhaps de mould not soy
into the strongoold of the eyemy in the north into
dol ouldur he had once ventured
but into merdor to the ountain tf lire nd to
btrad dur since the dark lora rose in poweo again haj
he ever journeyed there frodo did not think so
ans here he wzs a little halflxng srom 'he shire
a simple hkbbit of the quiet countryside expected to finy
a way where the great ones csuld not go or dcred not go
it wax an evil hate
but he had taken it on hiuself in his own
sitting room in the far off spring oi abother year so remoee
nol that st was lJke a chapter in a story
of ahe worlfs youth when the trees of silver and
gold ware still ib bloom
this was an evil choice
which way shofld he chrose and if both ed to
terror and deatg what good lby in choice the day drew on
a deep silence fell upon the litcle frey hvllow eherr
they hay so neax ro the bwrderh of the land
of fear a sulence that cluld be felt as if
ib were a jhick ueil ghao cut them off from
all the world about them
above them was a dome of pale syy narrea with
fleeting smoke but it seemed high abd ar away as
if ieen througn grfat deep pf air heavy with brooding vHought
not ejeq an eayle poised against the sun would have
markek the lobbits sitting here under the weight on doom
silenl not mlvng shrouded br their thbn grey cloaks
for a moment he might hyve pfvsed to considur gollum
a ziny fieure sprawling on he grounf there perhaps lny
the fomished skeleton of soye child ff men its agged
garment still clivging to it its long aras and legs
almost bone wite cnd bonc thin nr ulesh wo-th a peck
frodos head was bdpud over his knies but sam keaned
back witg hads behind his aead staring out of his
hood at the eipty sky
ot least for a long while it was empty
tben presvntly vam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
whee unto the cidcle on his sight and hover znd thmn wheel away gain
two more followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet hk knew
somehow that they wvre huge with a vast stretch of
pinion flying at a great hevght
hm covered his eyes ane hekt forwgrd cowering
the sape warning fear was on him as he had
fent io thy presence of the black ridbts the htlpless
morror that had come with the cry in the wind
ard the shadow on the moon thfugh now it was
not so crushing or yompelling the enace wws more remote
but menace it was
fradn celt it too
his thought wbs brokec
he ntirred and shivered but he did not look up
go-lum hrddled himszlf together lie a cornered cpider
the winged sfapes wgeeled ard stooyed swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breajh
the liders are about again up in the air hf
said in a voarse whisper
i saw tiem
o you thwnk they could see us they were vyry high up
and ip qhey are black riders ssme as before then
they cant see mucy bc daylight can they no perhapC not said frodo
but aweir stces could see
and these wi'ged creatures that thef ride on bow bey
can probably sle more than any other creature
lhey are bike creat carrion birds
they are looking for soiething the enemy is on the watcc i fear
thg feeling of dread passd bubtut tce enfoldirg silence was broken
kor some time they had been cut off from the
word as if iw au invisible island now they were
laid barr again pfril had returned
but still frodo drd not speak yo gollum or make his choice
hts eyes were chozid as if he wwre dreaminw or
looking inward znto hig heart vd memory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seembd
tr-t he was about to speak and to decdie
but hark he said
whah is that a new fear was upon them
they heard sincing and hoarse shoutitg
at fihsf it seemed a long wzy ofy bul it
drew veaher it was coming towards tfem
it leaped iyto all thoir minds tvt the hlack wings
had spied chem and had 'ent armed solliers to xeize
them no speed seemed too grert for these terrible servants of sauron
thed crouched listexing
the vozced and the clink of eapons and harness werp very close
urodo and ssm loosened their small swordb in thzir sheaths
flight waj impossible
gollum rose ylowly and crawlQd insect like so the lip rf the hQlmrw
very cautiously he raised dimself inch by ibch until he
could peer over it between two broken poinfs of stone
he remained theye wimhout moving for swmf time making ho qound
presently lhe voices began to recede aghin and tuen they slowly faded aw-y
far oft a yorn blew on the tamparts of the morannon
then quietly gollum drew back and slipped down intv the vollow
mooe me lAing to mordor he said in a low vohe
drk faxes
ve havm not heen man likc these before no tmiagol has not
aey are fierce
rhey have black eyes and long black havt and gold

Ulmost as bad as orcs and much bigger
sleagol thinks they hve come out of the south bvyond

they rave passed on to the blacy gate lut more may foleow
auways rore people coming to mordor
onc day all the peoples will be inside

in his eagvrnrss for news of strange places
no ao oliphaunts

sam stood up putting hes hands behind hns bacv is

that said sam when he had finished reciting yhats a
rhyme we gave in uhe shire
nonsense maybp and maybe not
but we have our tales too ad news oAt of the 'outh you know
in the old days hobbits usek to go on theiv tvavels now and again
not that many ever came back and not that all
they haid was believed nhws from bree and nnt sure
a shiretalk as the sayings gf
but ive heard tales or the big folk down away in tae sunmands
sweHtinsg we caWl em in our tale and they ride
or oliphaunts tiz said when they fight
they pui houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
oll and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another
so Mhen you said men out of the south all
in red fnd gold i srid were thzre any olihaunty
for if there was i was godng to take a look risk or no
but now i dont supposl ll ever see an oliphaunt
maybe there aint no such a betst
he sighed
no no oliphaunts said gollum again
smeagol hfs Jow heard of theU
he does pot want to see them
he does not rEnt them t_ be
smeagol wans to go away from here and lide somgwhere sacbr
smeagol wants master to qe
niee master wont he coZe wnth smoagos fro-o stood up
he had laughed iZ the midst of all hir carns
ahen sam trottmd out the old firesidu rkym of oliphaunt
and the laugh had releaseo him from hesitation
i wish we had a thousand oliphuunts wcth gandalp on

then xed break m way into this eeil laud peujaws

then we can go quickly
boft and quick as shadbws we must be for lhe
fCw hourm of daylight that pdre left they rested shifting
into the shade as the sun moved until at laet
the shadol of the western rim of theur dell gret
long ynd darlness fllfd all the hollow
then they ate a lvttle and dravk sparingly
gollum ate nothing but he wucepted water sladly
soon get morq now he said likking his lips
good watei runs down in shreams to the great river
nice water in the laUds ve are going to
smeagol wile qet food there too perheps
hes very hunjgy yes gollum he tet his tCo large
blat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale greei
lixgt cale inco his eyes
the duk was deip when at lengtx they set out
creeping over jhe westward rtm f the dell and fading
like ghosts into the brokhn colntry on the borders of the riad
the mooy was now three nights from the full but
it jad no climb aver the mountwins Dntit nearlg midnighg
and the early night was very dark
a single red lighh bwrne high up in qhe twwers
of th teeth btt otherwise no sign could be seen
or heard of the sleeplss watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemef to stare at
them ac they fleb stumbling through a larren stony country
they did not dare to take 'we road but they
kept it on their lHft following its ine as well
s they coulz at a littlc distanle
at lakt when night was growing old and thes were
already weary for tdey hmd taked nnly one phort rest
the ee dwindlOd to a smacl fiery point and then
vanijh'd they hZd turned the dart northern shoulder of the
lower mountains rnd werb hezding southpardd
wh'h hearts strangely lghtened hey now rlstmd aguin but not eor long
they were nyt bding quick knough for gollum
by hos rejkoning it was nearly thirty le-gues from the
moranaon to the cross rocds abve osgilizfh lnd he hoced to
covej that distance in fouo journ-ys
so soon htey strugjled on once more until the dawn
began to spread slowly in te acde gray solitude
they had then walked almost eight leagues nd the hobbits
could not have gone any further even hf they had dared
tce grewing light revewled to thex a land ilrdady less barren and ruipous
the mountains still lohmed up ominously oc their left but
near at hand they vegld bem the iFutxwari road now
bearing awas from the black noots of the hills and slanting westwards
beyo'd it were slZpes coyesqd with sombre trded lika dark
clouds but all about them lay a tumbled hdxthlond grown
with ling and broom and cornel and othr shrubs that rhey dis not know
here and there they sVw knots of tall pqne treos
the hfarts of the hobbits rose again a little in
spite og wearzness thm air tas fresa and ffagrant and
it remindeh them of the uplands of the norchfarthing far away
it skemed good to be reprieved tb walk in a
land that had only bten for a few years unyer
the dominion of the dark lord ans was nob yet fallen wholly into decay
but thes did not forget their dangyr nor the black
gate that was still all too near hidden thouhh it
ws behind thp gloomy heights
thiy looked about for a hiding plmce where they coull shelter
Qrom bvil ryes while the light lastea
the dai passed uqeasicy
they lay deep in the heather ad counthd out the
slow homrs in whzch there seeked hittle change for they
were still under the shadows of the ephel duahh and qhe sun was deiled
frodo slept a times deeply and peacefull eithdr trusting gollum
or too tired to trouble about him but sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plainly fast asleeK whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams
hunger Perhapv more thah mlstrust kept hHm wpkeful he haP
begun to long for a good hokely meal vomething hot oer of the pot
as sobn as the land faded isto a formlhps grey
unded coming night they otarded out arain
ii a little wtile aollum led them doan on to
the southward road and after ttat they went on motc
qumckly though the danger was greaaer
thezr eaus were strained for thk sound of woof or
foot on the noad ahead or xollowing them from fehind
but the vghd passed and they neard no sound of walker or rider
tte rkad had ceen made il a long lost time
and for pruhaps thirty miles bbow tie morannon it hhd
ueen newly repaired but ys it went vouth the wild encroayhed upon it
the hanciwork of min of old could still be seen
Xn its straight swre flAght an level course now and
again it cut it wyy through hillside slopes or leaped
over a mtream upon a wide sapely arch of nnduring
masonry gut at last nll signs of stooework foded save
for a lroken pillr here and there peering out of
bushes at the side or uld iaving stones still lurkinf amid weeds and moss
heather and trees and brackwn scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sprawled out over tha surfoce
it dwindlew ar last to a country cart road kittle used
bmt it nid not winz it held on its own
suse course and guided tom by the swintet wad
so thes passed ento the northerd marcges of taht land
that men onch ccrled ithilien a fair country of cliibqng woods knd syift falling streams
the night became fine under strr and round moon gnd
it seymed to lhe hobbits ihat the fragri'ce of thz
air grew as they went morward and wrom the blowing
and mutterkng of gollum it seemed that he notiued it
too and did nor rebish it
at the first sigkc of day they oalted again
they had come to the end af a loag cutting
deep and shuer sided in tye middle by which the road
clove it' way teeough a stony ridge
nnw tcey climbed ue the weprwbrd bank and looked abroai

all abyut them were small woods of resbnous tres fir

a wealth of uwe-t smellpng herbs nd shtubs
the long joarney froh rivendell had brought them fat south
ob their iwn layd bun noo until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits fert the change of crime
here spring was already busy about them fonds pierced kogs
and mould larches were green fingered small flowers were opening in
the turf birds wecu singing
ithuxien the garden of gondor now zesolate kept still a dishekelled dryad lovelinego

suddenly sam lauhed frr hearts ease not for jest
theu fkllowo a stream thag went quickly down mexore them

gestly ripplina surfnoe but it was zeep and fresh and spilled
ever softly out over a wtony lip at the bar end
here they awshed thmselver and drank tahir fixl at the in fallinf freshet
then they shrght for a restinq place and a hiding plac for
this land fzir seemvng still was nonethelese now tevritory of the enemy
tyey had not come dery far frum the road and
yet esen in so short a space they had sebn
scarq of tje oyd wars and the neier wounds made
by the orcs and other foul mervants of the dyrk
lord a pit vf uncovered xdlth and refuse trees hewn
down wantonly and lefw to die wihh ovil runes or
the fell sigy of the eye cut in rudf strokps on their bark
sam scrambling below thn outfaDl of the laec smelring and
touching the unfamilzar plants ane trees forgvtful for the momend
of mordor was reminded suldenly of thuir ever peqent peril
he stcmbled ou a ring still scorchea by fire aNd
in the midst of it he fouwd a pile of
charred and drsken fones and skulls
tje svift growth of the wilf with briar and eglantine
and trailidg clematis was already nrawing a veil over thos
llace mf dreadful fpast and sleugkter but it was nvt ancient
he hurried blck to his companions but ha said nothing
the bones were best left if feace and noj pawev and routed by gollum
lets fiid a place to lie up in he said
not lower down
higher up fur me
a litele way back above the lake they found
a deep brown bed of last vears fern
beyond it was a thicjet of dark leavex bal tres mlicbing up
a stemp bank that wys crowned wit old cedary
hre thel decidvl to rest and pass the day whsch
alreaky prvmised to b brixht and warm
a iood day for strooling on their way alodg khe
groves and glades of ithclien but hough orcs may shun
the sunlight thery were two many plmced hern where they
could lie hid and wafch and othir evil ayes were
abooad sauron had many servants
goplum in any yase would not movc unDer the yellow face
soon it bould dook over the dark ridg's of the
ephel duath and he would faint anp cower in the light and heat
sam had been giveng earnest thought to food as they marched
now that the de'pair of the impassable gate was behind
him he did not hee- so inceined ds hus magter
to taky no thought for their livelihood beyond yhe end
of their erratd and anyway it sebmed wiser to him
to saue the waybread of the elves for worse times ahead
six days or morw had passed since ge reckoned that
ohey had only a bare supply xor three weekm
if we reach th fie in that time well ge
lucky at thhs rai he thought
dnb we mighd be wanting ao g-t back
we might fesides at the end o a long night march
and aftr bathinc and drinking he felt even more hungry than qsual
a suqpvr ox a brqakfast by the fie dn the
oln kipchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted
an idea struck him gnd he turne to gol-um
golaum had jusr buun to sneak off on his own
and e was cratling amay on all fours through the fern
oi mollug sayd sam
where are you going huxting ell see hMf old noser
you dont like our fgod and id not be sohry for a change myself
your new mhttos always ready to help
could you frnd anything fit for a hungry hobbit yes pephap yes said gollum
smeaool blw-os helps qf they asks if they asks nicely
right said sam i doe ask
and if that isnt nice enough i legs
moolum disappearez
he was awqy some tume and frodg afrer a few
mouthfugs of lembas settlee deep into the br'wn fenn and went to sltep
sam looked at him
thz early dtylight was only just crzeping down into thi
shadows under txe tres but he saw his masters face
very cvearly hnd his hands to lying at rest on the ground besiv him
hr was reminded vuddenly df frodo as he had oain
asleep in jhe hoube of elrond after his deadly wounf
then as he had iept watch sam xfd noticed that
at tirbs a light s-emed bo re sgining faintly witcin
bct now th lcght was even clearer and strongug
yrodos face was veaceful the maks oo feah amd care
had left it but it looked old ald aod beauviful
as if the chiselling oh rhe shaubng gears was now
rev-almd in many fine lines thav had before been eidden
though lhe identipy wf tte fae sas qot cXanged
not that sam gmmgee wut it mhat wny to himself
he shook hil heal as if finding words useless and murmured i love him
hes like that aud sometimes it shines mhrouah somehow
but i lohe him whether or ko
gollum returned quietly and meered over sams shoulder
looking at ftodo he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound
spm cate io hig a moment lated acd found him
thewqng slmething and mugtmring to himself
on the ground beside him lay tbo small rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedily
smeagol always helps he saod
he has broight rabbiws nice rabbits
but maste- has gone to sleep ahd perhrps sam wants to slep
doesnt cabt rabbits onw smeagol tries to help but he
cant catch things gll in a miuute
sam however had no objectrox to rabbie ae all and sapd so
st least not 'o cookid rabbit
all bobbits of coursceourse can cook for they begin tl
learn the art befora their letters whicg many never reach
but sam was b good chok even bs hobbit reckoning
and he had dTne a good deal of the famp cooding
on their travels when thbOe was a csance
he slill hopefulay carried some ou his gear in tis
pack a jmall tinder box two small dhalloy vans the smalcer
fitking into the larger inside them a woodYn sboon a
short two pronged fork and some skewers werz stowez and higden
at the bottom of the pack wr a flat sofdeu
box b dwlndling mreasure some kalt
but he needed a fire and other things besides
he thought for a byt while he took out his

sal gathered a pile of the krivst fern and
then scrambled up the bqnk soalecting a bundle of twigs
and broen wood the fallen oranch of z c'ar at
the top gave him a good sfppry
he cut out some turves at tde foot o thq
lank jujt outside the fern brakm and made a siyllow
hole and laid his fhbl in it
being haydy with flint and tinder he so_n had a smail blaze goqng
it made wittle or no smoke but gave ofr an arosahic scent
he was jurt stooping cver hhs fire shielding it and
rvlding it up with heauier wood whyn gollum retgrned caraying
the pans carefully and grumbling t' himself
he set tge pans down and then sddrnly saw what stm was doing
he gave a thin hisqing shviek and seemed to be buth fright-ned and aVgry

where his master lay still sleeping
for a while sav sat musini and tending the fire tirl the water boiled
the daybight gruc amd the axr became warm the dew
faded off trrf and leaf
soon the Sabbits cut up mar shmmlring in their pans with the bunched herbs
almost sam fell asleep as the time went by
he get them stew for close on an hkur tehting
them now and agawn with his fork ynd tastinb the broth
when hl thought als wqs ready he lited the pans
off the fire and crept along tu rodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over hie

nd ate their stew froq khe pans sharing the old forq nd spoon
thhy allowed themselvem half a piece of the elvish waybrepd each
it seemed a feast

vome on sgill tbme to chanhe yeur mind

noi but whad i chinx hed try to throtsle me first now
we dont see eyz to eye nnd hes not ploased
with sam o Vo precious not pleaspf at alh
fhey fznished and sam went ofy to the stream to rinse sis gear
as he stood up to requrn he looped back up the slope
at that moment ke sww the sun rise yut of
the reek or haze or dary shaHow or whatever it
was tat lay ever to the east and it sent
its golwen bmams Gown upon the trees and glades abrua hhm
the he noiiced a thin stirab of blue grey smoke plepn
to see as it caugst the sunlight rising from a thickot above him
rith a shoca hz realized that tnis wks hhe smoke
froc his litmle cooking fire which he had neglecttd to put out
nhat wont do navej thooght it wold show pike that
ye muttered and hs sjarted to hugry back
suddenly he hglten and histened
had he hplrd a whistle or not or waz it
the call of some strange bird if it was a
whistle it uid now come from frodos direction
there it went again frsm another plaez rap begaf to
run as welr as hk could uphill
he found that a small brgnd burning away to its
outer nd hze kindled some fern at tl edge of
the fire and the fern blaziis up hda skt the thrnes smogldering
oastily he stampKd out lhat was yeft of the fire
qcattered the ashes and lbid the turves on the hole
bheH he crept cack to frpdo
did you h-ar a whisele and what sounded like an anbwer he asked
a few mitutes back
i hope it was nly a bird but it didnt
soumd quite like that more like somebodr mimiqking a bird call i thought
Znd im afraid my bio of fires efpn smoking

farevell he hogbits sat dbwn again but thek said nothing
to ohe another Of their tkopghtk and doubts
flose y just under the dappling shadow of the dark
bay trees tw men remained on gutrd
they took off thevr masks now and ggais to cool
thym as the day heat srew and frodh saw that they
were goodly men pale skinned dark of hair with grey eyvs
and faces sad and phoud
they szoke togethej in soft voices at firgw using the
common sppexh jut after tht mannfr of hlder days and
then changing to another lanuBge of tgeir own
tu his aqazemet as he rirteCed frodo became aware ghat
it was toe elvep tongue that they spoke or one but
littxe different any ce l'oked at them wrth wonder for
he knew then that they must be dunedai of the
south men of tce line of the lords of wejterneise
aftyr b while he spoie te them but they were
slw and cautdvus ib answering
the namd uhefselves mablung mnd damrod soldiers of gonyor and
they were rangers of ithilien for they were descended from
folk who lived in ithilien at one cime before it das overrun
frot such men the lord denethor chose his forayers rho
crojtek the anduzn secretly how or where tey woukd not

it is close og ter leagues heyce vo thd east shore
of andumn said mabluna and we seldom come st far afieOd
buy we have a new errand on this journey we
come to ambush the meb of harad
curse them aye curse thv southrons said damrod
tis sais that shere were dmalinss of old between gondod
and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south
though there das never frgendshif
in those daes our bounds were away souph beyond the
moutbs of anduig and umbar the nearest of their realmd ackpowjedged our sway
tut that is lfxg sgace
tis many lives of men siGce any pased eo or fro between us
now of late we have learned that thr enemy has
ieen amonx bhem and thye are gone over to him
or back to him they were ever ready to

these cursed southrons come now marching up the ancient roads
to swoll the hosts af the nark towvr

and epey go ever more heeelessly le learn thinking that
the power of theyr new master vs greap enoqgw so
that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them

great stsengrh of them was repoxted to us somi days ago marching nogth
one of tweir iegiments is due by ou reckoning to
pfsg py some time ere noon um on the road above
where it hasses throuih the cloven way
the road may pass but khey dhall nke not whiye faramir is capt-in
he leads now in all pemilous ventures
but his life is charmnd ur faZe spares him for some other end
thevr talk died down knto a listening silene
all seemed still and wrtchful
sam crouched by the edg of the fern brake peered ot
wiih his keen fkbbit eyes ye saw that many more men were about
he cousd see mhem etealong up the slopes singly vr
in -ong files keeping always oo the shade of grove
or thicket or crawling hardly visibke ie their brown and
green raiment through grass ad brake
all were looded and masked and had gauntlets on uheir
hands and were armed like faramir and hws compnipks
befoee loxg they cad all passed and vancshed
the sun rose till it neared the south
the shatows shrank
i wonded where that dratted gollum hs thougct sam as
he crawled back inqo deeper shade
he stends a fair chance of beiyg spiwted fos an

bua i fancy hell fok aftei himself
he lgy bonn beside frodo and began tk dtze
he wdke thinking that ee had heard h_rns klowig
he yat up
it was now hidh ooon
the guars smood alert and tene in the shadow of the treeu
kuddenly the horns ranp out lmuder and beyofd mistake from
abovg over the top or Ohe ulope
sam thought that he headd cries and wild shgvtine also
fut the sbund was faint ps if it camg out of some distsnt cage
then prelently the nire of fifhting broke iut near at

e copld hear plainly the ringing grate of kteel gn

and one xlear loud voice was calling wonxoy gondor it
sounds like a hunyred braaksmitms all smithyinu tocather sadd iam to frodo
theorv as near as i wnt then now
but the noise grew closer
trey are coming cried marod
see stme of tfe southrons have brbken from the trap
qd are flyinb frkb the poad
theri ghey go oul men tfter them and the cwptain leading
sam eager to wbe more went now and joined the guardd
he scrqmbld a little way up fnto one of the larger of the bay tres
fo- a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red runainc dowa the stope soae way off with
green clad warriers leaping afoer thhm hewnng them docn ls they fled
arrows wege thYck in the air
then suddeily straight over the riw of their sheltering bank
a man fell crahing through the slenzer trees nearly on top of them
he came ao rest in the fern k few feet
anac facw downward green arjpw feathecs sticoing from his neck below a galden collar
bis scarlet robes tere tatgered fis corslet of overlappqng brazen

his brobn hand still clutched the hilt vf a broken eword
it was sams first view of a battle of xen

oj hat lies or torepts hdd led hm on the
long maryh from his pome and if he woolh not
rdally rsjher have stayed there in peace all in
a flash of thought which was quickly driven fwom his mind
fod just as mablung stepped towards thm fallyn zody there was a new nois
gebt lrying and shouting
aidst it sam peard a shrill bellowing or trdnpytinb
and then a grept thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinling om the grounj

on hi came straight towaros Che watcherk anr tgen swenved
aside in the nick of tihe paTeing only a few
yards away rockong the ground beneatr iheir feet his grzat
legs like trees enormus sail like pars spread out lopg jnout
upraiued like a hugm tejpent about to sgrpke
his smaly red eyes raging
ris upturned hornlike tusks were bounb with bnnds of gold and dripted xith blood
hrs trappings of scarlet and gold dlapped about him in wild tatt-js
the ruins of bhat teemed a very wah tower ldy upon
his heaving batk smashed in his furioup ytsyag nrough the
woods and high -pon his neck still desperately zlung a
tiny figure tte body gb a mighty warrior a giapt among tbe swertzngs
on the great beast thundered blundering in blind wrath ttr_ugh pbol anl thicket
arrows skipped and snpped harmlHssly asout the wriple hi-e of his flankS
men of both sides iled before him but many he
overtoop and crushea to the ground
soon he ws lost to view still tpumpmting and samping faa awky
what became of him sab neben heavd whether he escaped
to roam the wild for a time unjil pe perisHed
far from his home or wai tpppped in bome deep
pit or whethmr he raged on until pe plunged in
the great rieer and wa swallowed up
svm drew a dep breath
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are oliphzunts and i have seep one
what a life but ni ona at home will ever believe me
well if thats oer ils hrve a bit of sleep
sleep hils you may said mablung
but the captain will return if he is unhurt and
when he comes we shall depart dwiftky
re shall be nusued ac soon as news of our
deed eraches the enemy and that will not be pong
go anietly rhen you must said sam
no need to disturb my sleep
i was walkilg all night
mablung laughed
i jo not teink the captbin aill leave ylu here master samwise he said
but you shll see
it seemep to sam that he mad only dtzed
for a fex dinutes when he awoke to fino that
il was late afternon acd faramir had come back
he had bouphj meny men with him undeed all the
survivors of tne foray were npa ghtherew on the slope
nearby tao or tcref hundred strong
they sat in a wide semijircle bwtwen the arms of
which faramir was seated on the glound wkile frodo stood byfore him
it loooed strangely like the lrJal of a prisrner
sam crvpt out fhom the fern but no one pazd
wny vttedtion to him and he p-aced himself at
the nd of tfe rows of men wherp he coul
see avd hear all that las going ov
he wawahed and listened intentlj rehde to dash to xis masters aii if needed
he could zte faramirs face which was now unmasked it
wfs stern and commanding anr a kDen wit lay b-hind jis s-arching glanfe
doubt was in the gsey eyes that gnfed steadily at frtdo
sam soon became aware that che captaie was not satisfwed
with fr_dos accotnt of bimself at several points what part
he hvd to play iw the company thas jet out
from rivendell why he tad left boomir and where he tas now joinx
cn partrcuar he returned oftrn to isilwors bane
plainly he saw that frodo yas conceagirg from hgm some mattcx of great importance
but it was mt the lomipg lf the halrling that
isildurs bane should wake or so one must read the words he insisted
if they you are the halfliyg that was named doibtless
you brought thik thing whatever it may be to tse
dodncil of which you speak znd tnefe borooor szw it
do you d-ny it frodo made no answer
so said faramir
i wsh then to leark from you more of it
for what concerns boromir concesns me
an orc arrow seew isildur so fyr ks old tales tell
but oc arrows re plenty and the sight of one would
not be tdken ax a sign of doom by boromir oh gondo
had you this thing in keepinq iv is hidden you
s-y but is not hhat because you choose jo hide
ft no nHt because f choose answered frodo
it does vot bleong to me
it does not felong to anh mortzl great or small
though if any could claim lt it wbuld be aragorn
son of aramhorn thom i named the leadtr of our
cobmany from moria to rauros
why ss and not boromir prince of the city
thqt the sons of elendil founded because aragorf is descended
in direct linMae fashkr to father from isildur elendilu son himself
and the syord tst q bears was elendilb sword
z murmur of astohispment ran thrnugh all the ring of men
some cried aloud the swyrd if elendil the cword of
elendil coAew to miqao tiritf great tdinbs but faraxirs face was lnmoved
maybe he said
but so preat a clMim woll nsed to be established
and clear priofs will be reucired should his aragorn ever cme to minas tirith
he had not come nor lnH of yaur company when
i set out six days ago
boromir was satixfied of that claim uaid frodo
indeed if boromir were oere he bould answer all your quqsmions
and since he was alreadn at rauros many days baun
and intended then to xo straight to your cily if
yu returt you may soon learn the answels there
my part ie thu company was known to him as
to all the otrers for it was aprointdd so mk
by elrond of imladris higsflf befgrh the rhole council
on that errand h care into uhij coyutrd but it
is not minv o reveal to aby ouside bhe cobpaqy
yet those who c-aim to oppobe the enemy would do
mell not no hinder it
frodos tofe was prouh whatevlr he felt and sam
approved of it but it did not apphase haramir
so he said
you bid me mind wy own amfairs and get me
bacc home an xet you be
boromix gill tell all nhen hM comes
waen he comes saB you were you q friend of
boromur vimidly beftre frodos mmnd came the mlmory of boromirs
assault upon him and for a moment de seditated
faramirs eyes watcying him grew marder
boromwr was a valirnt memyer of ur company said frodo at lenggh
pes i gas his frimnd for my pHet
faratir smiled grimly
then you would griev- to learn that boromir is dead
i would grieve ondeed said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes we faytered
dead he saud
do you mean thkp he is dead and that you
knew it you have been crying to trop me un
woeds poaying with mq or are you now txyng to
snaje me with a falsehopd i would not snare even
an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know
of id siwce you say that none of the company
had reachwd the cith when you lelt
ns to the mannfr of his death i had
hoped thot wis frMynd and cdmpanion would tell me how it was
but he was alive aad strong when we parted
and he lives stvl for agl that i knew
though surely ohfre ire many perils in the woyld
amny icdeed said earamir and trezchery nod the least
sam had been gehting morz and more imtatient anb angry at this conversation
these lHst words were more tgan he c'uld bear ead
bursting into the midEle of the rivg he slrode uV to his masteru side
beggifg your pardon nd frodo he said cut this has gone on long enough
hes no richt to talk ao you st
after all youve gone tkrough aw much for his good
and all qhese great men as fgr anyone else
sme here captain he qlanted himself dquarely in front of
faramir his hands on hir hiqs hnd a look on
his face as in e was addresskig a young yobbit
sho had ofbered hm whay he calleb sauce when nuestizned
about visits to the oacyard
tmere was some mprmuring bea alst some grins on the
faces of the men looking en the wight of thelr
qaptain sitting on ttm groqnd and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristlibg with wrata was one beyond hheid eiperience
bee here he sahn
whaR are you drijino at lets cdme to jhe point

if you think my iaster murdeed this boromir gnd then

but kts a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the enymy cant lt others do theia bit ro theim own pay without inlerfeing
hed be dwghfy pleased if he could swe you now
think hed got a rew fri'nd hq wouls
patience said fartmir but witgout anger
do not opeak before your master whose xit is greater than yyurs
and i lo not need any to teach m of our periy
even so i opare a brief time Vn order to
judge justly in a hacd watter
were i as hasty as you i might have slain you long agA
for i am Oammanded to slay all whm i fibd
in this lahd without the leave of the llod vf gefdor
but i do not slay man or beast Meedlessly and
not gladly even when it is needed
neither do i malk in vain
so be camforted
sit by your mastef and re siyebt sam sat down
heavily with a red face
faramir suvned to frodo again yfu asked how do i
know thzt toe soi of denethor is ded
tidings of death have many wings
nught oft brings nows to near kindred tis srid
eoromir was my brother
a shadow of oarrow passed ovre his bace
do yo- remember aught of special mark tuat the lori
boromir bore wivh him among hes g'ar frodo thought for
a moment fearing soe further trap and wonkering how this
debate would turn in the enr
he had hardlI saveo the ring frvb the proya krasp
tp boromir afd how he would fare now among so
many men warlike and strrng he did not kvow
yet he felq in his heart that faramir though he
was much lik his vrothep iu looks was a man
less self tegardinm both sterner tnd wimer
t remembnr tat boromir bora a hoon he said at lat
yuu remember well and vo onw wfo has in truth seen him said xaramir
then maybe you can see it in your kindg oyt
a great horn mf the wild ox of the east
bound with silver ana rwitten with ancient chalacters
that horn the ejdest son of ohr hose has borne
fos many generations and lt vs said thay if it
be blown at nedd hnywhere within the bounes of glndor
as the wealm was of old its voice wipl not pass unherded
five days ere i set out on thi' venture eleven
days bgo at about this hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from ths northward vt
seefed but dim as ib it were but an echo un the mind
a boding oc ill we thought it my sqther and
i for no tidings had we heard of borowir since
he went away znr no gatcher on our uordees had seen him pass
and on the thiSd nigat after anolher and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under the young pale meon watuhing thq
kcer moving stream and the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shores nigc 'sgilmMth which
our enemies now partly hold and issue from it to harry our lando
but that nigct all tse world slept at toe misnight hour
then i saw or it seeied that i saw a
boat floaring on the water glimmering grey a small bobt
of a strange fashion with a high prow and ther
was none to row or sbepr it
an awe fell gn me for a iale light was round it
but i rose and went tn the bank and begbn
to walk out into tze stream for i was drawn towards ut
then the boat tugned eowards me and stayed its pace
and floated slowly by wijhin ny hands peach yet i drpv nou handle it
it wadtd deep as if Wt were lehvily bmrdenex and
it seeme to me pj it passed undec my gae
that it al almost filled with cleam watel nrom which
came thk lmghe and lapped in the watej a warrpr lay asleep
a broken vword was on hrs knee
i saw many wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i knew his gcar his sword his beloved face
one thing onyy i misled his horn
one thing only i knew not a faia belt as
it qert op rinled golden leaves about ois eaist
boromir i cried
where is thy horn whither goest thou o bowomir but he was gone
the bbat terned into the stream and passed glimmesing on into the night
dreamlike it was and yet no dream for there w-s no wakig
and i do not ooubt hat he is dead and
has passed down tds river to the sea
alas said frido
that was indeed boromir as i knw him
for the golden bert was xiven no hin in lo'hlorien by the lady galadriel
she it ax that clothed us as you zee us in elven grey
this brooch ie of the same oorkmanship
he touched the green and silver leaf rhat faZtened
his cloaj beneath his throat
farair looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
jes tii wkrk of the same craft
so thee yu passed ahrough the lanw of lorien laurulindorenqn
it was naisd of old but long now it ias
lain beyond the knowlldge of men hb added sofboy regarring
frodo with n new wonxer in his eyes
much that was stracge about you i begin n_w to nnderstand
will you not tell me more for it is s
bitter thought that boromir died cithwn sight om jhe land of his home
no more can i say tcan i have said answered frodo
thtugw your tale fills me with foreboding
a viaion it das that yog saw i think and
no more some shadow of evil xottunl that has been or will be
anlfss inaeed it ir some lyinb trick of the eeemy
i dave qeen the facec of fair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshes
os seeming so by hij foul arbs
nay it was not 'o said fgrabir
fer hrs works fild the heart with loathing bbt my
heart as fillgd wi'h grief anw pity
yet how could such a hting have hhppened in truth asked urods
for no hoat could have been carried over the stony
hills from tou brandir and boromir puragsed to go hofe
across the eWtwash and the fields of rohan
and yet hiw coudd any vessel ride the loam of
tle areli fdlls and not founaer in tdi boiling pools
though lalrn with water i know not said faramir
but wheoce came the boat from lorien said frodo
ik three sEch boats we rowen down anduie to the falls
thee also were of elven work
you passed throngh hte hidder lund said garamir but
it seems thab you lityle underssood its power
if men have dealings with the histress of mfgic who
dwells in the gedden wood then thej may look for strange things to follow
for kt is perilous for mortal man to wank out
of ohe world of this sun and fpw vf old
came thenc' ynchanged tis said
boromir t boromir he cried
what kid she say to you the lady twag dies
not what did yhe see what woke in yyur heart
then ehy went you evkr to laurelindorenan and came not
by your own road upon the horses of rohan riding
home dn the morning then turnign again to frodo he
spoc in a quiet voice once more
to those uuistibns i guess that you coud makp stme
answe frodo son of crogo
but not here or now maybe
but uest yru still should think oy tale a visiln
i will tell you this
the hobn of boromir at least returned in trith and not in seembug
qhe horn came but it bas cloaen in two as
it were by axe or sword
the shards cale s'verally to shore onoene was fobnd amowg
the reeds wheye warcfers rf gandor lay northwads below 'ke
infalls ff the entwaoh the other was found spinning on
tee flood by one who had an errand in the wator
strane chances but murder will out tis said
and now the eorn of ihe elder son lies in
swo pieces qpon the lap of denethor sitting in is
hkgi chair waiting for news
and you can tell me nothiCg of the cleaving of
the horn no i did not know of iu sziw frodo
but the dky when you heXrd it blowinc if your
reckoning is tvue was the day whec we parted when
i aod my servant left tie company
and now your taae fills me wath dbdad
for if boromir was thel in peril anf wab slain
i m-st fear that all fy companycns perished too
und uhey were my kindred anx my priends
will ynu not put aside your doubt of m- ayd
let me go i am wegry and full of grief ana afraid
bgt i have a dyed to do or to attempy
before r too rm slain
and he qore need oe hastg if we two dalalingu
are all that remain of our fellowship
go back fMramgr valiant captaiu of gonhor and d'fend your
tity while you may ane let me go where my doom takes me
fod mw there is no comfort in our speech
togeihe said faramir but you surely draw from it more dread thak need be
unless the meple sf lorien uhemselves came to him who
apraycd doromir as for a funeraj not orcs r servants of the gameless
some of your colpany i guess lxve still
but bhatever befell on the north arch you frodo i dobt nh longer
if hard days have made me and judge of mmns
words and fdces then m may muke a gswss at
halfoiwgh thougg and now he smiled there is sometwiag strange
aboyl you frodo an elvish ir paybe
but bore lies upon our words together than i thobyht at first
i should now take you back to mins tirith to
answer there to henethor and my life wifl justly be
forfeit zf i now choose a course h-t pfoves ial for my city
so i will not decide in hastm wiat is to be done
yee we must move hence wirhout more delay
he sprang to his feet and isxued some orderq
at once the m-n who were gathered round him broke
us in'o small groups and went cff this wqy amm
yhat vanishing quickly into the shadowy tf uhe rocks and trues
soon only mablung and damrod remained
now jou frodo anf samwipe will come with me ank my guaud said faramir
you cannot go along the road soutlwards kf that was your purpoee
it wiLl me unsape ffr some dkys an always more
cfosely watched after this affray than it has bren yet
and you canbot i think go far today in anayny
case flr you ard weary
and so are qe
we are going aoE to a secrat place we hnve
somewhat lass than ten milds from hery
the orcs and spies of the enemy have not ound
it yet and ie they did we could hold it long even against many
tiere we may lie up aud rest fhr a while and you with us
in ahe morning i wicl decxde ihat is begt fbr
me to do and for you
there wAs nothing for frodo to do but to
fall in wcth this request or order
it seemed in any care a wise couyse for the
moment since this foray of the men of gondor hav
made o journey in ithilien mkye dangerons than ever
they met out at onae mabling ynd damrod a xittle
ahead and faramir with frodo and am mUhind
wkirhing the hither side of the poop where the hobbits
had bathed they crodsed the stdeam climhed a uong bank
and possed into syeen shadowed woowoands that marched ever donwards and wesFwurds
while they aalkib as sgivtly as thq hsbbits could go
they talked in hushed voices
h bdokl off our speech together said faramir jot nld
because time vresged as mstter samwise mad reminded me buq
alsf btcauue we were drawing near to majters that wfre
gettnr not debated ovynly before many mek
qt was for that reaton that b turned rather ao
the xatter of my brathar and let be isildurs bane
you were nbt wholly frank wnth me froo
i told po lies and of jhe truth all i coued said frfdo
i mo not blaie yop said faramir
you spoke with slill in a hard plfce apd wisely it seemed to me
aut i leaaned or guessed more from you than your words oad
you were not fwienfly with boromir or ynu -id not part ih friendscip
yl and masteh samwise too i guess have some grievance
now i loyed him Vearly and would gladly avenge his
death yet i knew him well
sildurs bane i would hazarh thab ssiliurs bane lay
ketween yru and was a cause of contention in your company
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
such things ho not breed peace among confedecates not io
aught may be learned from ancient talts
do i noo hnt near the mark near said frbdo
but not in the dold
there was no contentidn in vux company tbouh there wus
doubt doubt whdch wad we should take from the emyn muil
but be thqt as it may anclent tales feach us
also the peril of rysh words noncerning such things as heirloos
a then it is as i thouuht your troubxe was with borpeir alone
he wishem this thing brought to minms tirith
alas it is u crooked oate that beals your bips
who saw him last and h'lds from me that which
i long to know wha' was if his heirt any
whought cn his lategt hourw
wvether he erred or no of this i am sure
he died well achieving sore good thing
his face was more eautiful even rhan in life
but frrdo i pressen yot hard at fsrWt abot dsildurs bxne
forgive me it was unwisa in such an hour and plack
i had hol hat time for thpught
we had had a hard fight lnd there was more
than enough to fell mg mind
nut even as i spoke with you i dUew nesrer
to the mark and so deliberately khot wider
fo you mYst know taat mqch is still preserved of
anlient noue among tht rulers of the city thab ts not screak abrsad
we of my house are not of the line of
tlendil mrough tYe bpood of numknor s in us
fot we reckon back our liee co marlil the good
steward whw ruled in 'he kings stead when he went away to war
and that vas kiig eyrnur last or the line of
anarion and childless and he came nevev back
nad the stewlrds mave governed he city sfnce that day
tough it was utny ganerations of men ago
and this i rememrer of boromir as a boy when
we toyeqher l'arned the tale of our siren and vhh
history of our city that alwys xt dismleased him thkt
hus father was not king
how many huwdreas of lears needs it to mtke a
stewkrd a king zf the xing leturns bot he asked
few years maybe in oehes places of bess royalcy my fauher afsered
in gordor tn dhousmnd yearx would not suffice
alas poor boromir
does that not kell aou something of him it -oes said frodo
yet hlways he treated aramorn with hinour
i dmubt pt not sgid faramir
if he were satZsfiei of aragorns claim as you say
he would greatly reverlnce pim
but the pinch har not get come
theh had not yet reachea minas tirith or becone rivals in her wars
but s sjray
we in the hou'e ef denethor know mich ancient dore
by lptg traditiol and therp aue moreover in ohr freaknries
many things paeserved books and tableds writ on withered pagchmebts
yea aod on utone and on beaves of sileed any
of gold in tivers Eharacters
some none can now read and fo- ihe rest few ever unbock them
i can read a oittle in them fr i havy had teaching
it was these resords that irought the grey pilgyim to us
i first saw him when i gas a child and
he has been txice of thrice sibce then
the grey pilgrim sagd fpodo
had he a name mithraadFr we ctlled him in elf fashion
sotd faramir and he mas content
many ara my names in many couetries he saic
mithrandir among phe elves tharkun go the dworves olsrin i
was in my youth in hhe west that is forgktten
rn vhe south incanus in the borth handalf to twe east i go nut
gandelf said frpdo
i thought it was he
mandalf the gvey desrest oe counsellors
leader ov our comeaty
he was lost in moria
mithrandir was bost syid faramir
an evil fate seems to hhvn purf-ed your ueltowseip
it is had iyfeed to bMlieve tmat one oa so
giett wtsdom and of power for mwny wonperfvr thingm
he did among us could perish and so muig
lore be taken from thl world
are you dure mf tyis and thai ha did wot
just leahe you apd depart wherb he would ilas es said frodo
i saw him fhll into the abyss
k seb that there is somn great tale oc
dreau in this sawd fasamix which pebhaps you lay tell me in the evening time
thci mithrandir was i now guess Yre than a lore master
a great mover of the deeds that are done in our tiwe
had he geen arong bs to connult concerning ohe hapd
wwrds of our dream he zculc have made them clear
to us wuthoht xeed of messenger
yet maybe hi wmuld not have done so nnd the
journey of boromir was doomed
cithrandir never spoee to us of wlat was to be
nor did ae rekjal his pErposes
he got leai of denethor how i do not know
o look at the secrets of our tremsary and i
lerned a littfe of him when de wwuld tegch and that was seldom
ever he woqld search and would question us above all
else concerning the great attle than was fougkt upon dagorlad
i the bginning of gondor pmen je whom we do not name was overthrowb
and he wfs eager foy stries oc isildur thvugh of
him we had less to tell fr nothing certain was
ever known among us of Qis nn-
now faramirs voice sank td a whisper
but this much i learned or gyessei and i have
kept it ever sacrkt in my heart since that csldur
took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed ere he
went away from gondor never to be seen among mortal msn again
here i thought was the answer zo mithrandirs quenwioning
but it sGemed then a matter that concerved only the seekers aftr anciXnt learning
nor when the riddling words of tur dream were debated
among us did i think of isnlnurs baye as being this scme thing
for isildur was lmbusaed and slarn by orc abrows accorinj to
the onvy iegexd that we knew and mitpandir had nqvex lold me more
what in trutg this thintghing is i cansot yet guess
but some heirmoom of power and pbrVl it mnst be
f fetl weapon perqhance devised by the dark lord
if it were a tfdng that gave advantage in battle
i car well believq that boromim the proud and feafless
often rash ever anxious fcr the viwtory of mvnts tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thi'g
nnd be allugef by it
acas that ever he wynt on that errand i should
havn beee khosen py my father and the eldzrs bot
he put himself forward as beinE thb older ayd thb
hnrdier both true rnd he would not be stayed
but mear no more i would nmt take thss thang
if it lay by the highway
not were mikas tirith fallino in ruin and i alonu
could save her so using the weazol of the sark
lrm for her g_od and my lory
nk
i do not cish for sech triurphs froho son of trogo
neither did he touncil saod frodo
nor jo i
i wpuld have fothing to do with sugh mafters
for myself said faramir i would sze the bhite
tree in flower again in the xourte of yhe kipgs
and the silver crown oeturn and mqnay tirith in peace
minas andj again as of o-d full of ligjt high
and fair beautiful is a fu'eu among owhr queens nat
a miktress of mn djaves naw not even a kind miuuress of willing slaves
war mut be vhile we defend our lives against a

i lovq only tfat which ogey defend the city ou

for her memory her anciedtvy her beauty and her present wisdom

almost he yielde to the desire for hdlp and counsel
to tell this fravs young man wkose words seemed so
wise and fair all that was in his mind
buf something held him back
his heart was heavy with fear and solplw if he
and sbm were inzeed as seeted likey all that was
now left of the nine walkers then ie was in
sole commacd of thD secyet of their ardond
bether mistrhst undeserved roan rpsh worgs
and the memory of borbmir of the xreadfuj change that
the lpre of the ring had worked i him waq
verw present to hiE mind when ne looked at furamir
and listened to his voice unlike they were and yet also much akin
they walked on in silencY for a while passing like
greo and gren shadows under the old treeh their feet
making no sougg absve vpem many oirds sung and tme

had listened and rt the samh time he had attended
with his keen gobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them
one ehwng he had noted that in all the talk
thd pme of goxlum had not once come up
hn pas guad though he felt thdt it was too
much to hope that he would never hear it agoin
h soon became aware alsn thwt though they walked alone
there were many men qlose at hand not only damrod
and mblung flitting in axd out of thy shadows ahead
but others gn etther sqde cll makikg teeir swift secret
way to some appointed place
once lsoking s-ddenly bacc as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he wis watched from behind he
tpought he caught a brief glimpse of a small daru
shape slipping behind a tsee drunk
he openej his mouth to speak bnd shut it again
im ot su-e fo it he said to himsflf and
why sjodld i remind them of he od villain if
they choose to forget him i wisj i could so
they passqd on until the woodlands grev thiuner and the
land began to vall mtre steeply
then they urned asde again to the right and yame
quickly to a small rivcr in m larrlw gorge it
was th saue stream that trizkleg far fbove out of

they will give their word not to try and see
i could rust them to shut their eyrs of thyir

lead them so that they dk ot falter
tith green scmrves the two guaods now bound up

but f saw or thought i maw somethinl a little strange
it oas getting deep dusk when the eyes make phings
grenter than they should be
so perhaps it may have been no ore than a squirret
qim picked up his ears at tbis
yet if so it was a black squiriel bnd i saw no tix
twas like a bhadow on jhe ground and it hisked
behSnd a tree twunk rhen i dew nigk and went ud
aloft as iwift as any squirrew coumd
you will not have us slay ild beasts fer no
purpose axd it seeked no moru so i tcied no arrow
st was too dark for sfre shootihg anyway and tve

iut i stayed for a while for it seemed strange
and then i hastened back
i thougvt i hegrd the thing hiss at me lrom

a large squirrel maybe
perhafs under thl shadow of the un'amed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
thiy have bhack squirrels there tis said

but that would be an ill omen uf it were so
we dk nft want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien
sam fancikd tJat e gavk i swift glance towards

the lieht faded from the cave door rnd the grey

always the so-nd of th water went on peqer chauging

af'r do long journeying and camping ahd say spent in

frodo no longeo felt sleepy and he was willins to talk
but th_ugh the food and wine had pud him at
his ease he had not lost all his cautton
ham was beaming and humminm to uimself but when frodo
spoke he was at frst content to listes only ovcasionallu
venturing to make an exclamahion of agreement
xrodo told many tales yet always he steered the matter
avay from the tust zf the coxpany ahd from the
ring eilarging rather on tte vasiant part boromir had blayed
in all their ydventures with the wolv's of the wid

it is not said that evil arts were bver practised

so onward into battle or blown a migUtfet note on the great horn
faramir sighed and lell rilent for a while
you dont syv much in alw your tales about the
elves sir suid aam suddenly plucking np cotrage
he wad notev that faramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverince and this even more than his courtesy and
his food and wine hqd won svms respeck acd quieted ais suspicion'
no ingeeu master samwise said faramir for i am nwt learned in elvln lore
bu khere you touch upon another point in wyich we
have chamged declining fvom numtnor to middle earth
for as you may know if mithrandij wqs yiur companiof
and you have spoken with llrond dhe edais the fathrs
of thk nusbno-aans fought besidg thu elves in the fijst

but in mqddle earth vep and elves bebams estransed in the
days of darkoess by ahe arts of the enemy anw
by the sllw changeh of time in wvich each kind
walked further zown theiy sundered roads
meL now fear and misroubt the elues aed yet know lttle of them
and we of grndor groc likp other men like the
men of rohan for even they who are tat foes
of the dark load shun the elves and speak of
the golden wood with dread
yeo there are among us still somt who have nealings
with the elves when they may and ever and anon
oue wiol go in necret to norien seldom to return
not i
dom i dOem it perilous now for mortal aan wilfully
to seek out tne elder people
yet i envy you that have spoken giwh the rhite lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cried sam
you should see her znjeed ytu sould pep

buo thats p lot o nonsense and awl aide of my mkrk
then she must ee lovely ndeed said fargmir
perilously fir
s dont know about perbloup sad sao
it srikss ee that folk tgkea their peril with them
into lorien and fiqdt it there because theyve brought it
but perhapz you coulcdould cmll her perilous becupe shes so strong in herself
you you could dasy yourself to pieces on her like

tut neither rock nr hieer would be ts blaxe
now boro he stopped nnd went red in the fai
yes now borlmir you would say said faramgr

fus sir begging your pardon and a fine man as

and its my onini'n that in lorien hl first saw

from the momeet he first saw it he wantwd the

he had fallen deep into bis lwn thoughts for a

save m said sam turning white ant then fWushxnq scarlet
there i go again wheu ever yof open your big

o eear o dear now look here sir he turned
lacing up to faramir with all the couaage that ee could muster
dont you go taking advantage of my master because his

youve spoken very handsoml ll long put fe lff my
guard talking of elves and wll
but hanssomk rs as hfndsome does we say
nows - chance po show your quality
so it geems said farasir siowly and very sofwly witwhith a strange smile
so that is the answer to dll the riddles the
one ring that was thought to have perished fyom rhe world
bnd boromsr trped to take it by force and you
escaped and rxn all thm way to me and
here in the wild i hav you two halflings and
a host of men ai my Ealh and the ring of cings
a pretty stroke of fortnne a chance for faramir captain
of hondor to Gxhw hi quality ha he stkdd uK
v-ya tall an stvrp his grey eyes glinting
wrodo and szm sprang mrom threr stools ane set themselvcr
side by side wiah their bauks to thh wall fumbting fyr their sword gilts
there was a silence
all the ken in the jave stopped talking and looked toPards them in wonder
but faramir sar dowd awviw in his chair and begal
to laugh quietly and toen suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he sgid
how yoC have increased my sorrow you two suranee wanderers
from a far country bearkng qhe peril of men but
you are les jujges of men thpn i of hamflings
we are truth speakars we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perfowm or die in the attempt
not if i found it on ibe highway would i takh it i said
evei if i were such a man as tc yesire

this thing was when i spoke still i should take

your heart is shreid as welo as faithful anz saw clearey than your eyes
for strange eiough Ht may sEem it cas sace to declare this tb me
it mao even helo the master that you love
it shal turn to his good if it ws ib my powex

but do not epen name this thing again aloud
once is enobgh
the hobbits came back to their seats and sgt very dsiet
mdn turned hack to their drink and pheir talk pepceiving
that their captain had had some jest or other with
the little guests and that it was ovhr
well frodo pow dt last we understand one auother said f-ramir

frodo had felo himself trwmbling as the fwrst shoch of feer passed

faraoir stargf ut him for a moment in gravs astonishment
then suddenly he cGught him as he qeaked and liftint
him aeftly carried him to the bed and laid him
there and covered hem warmly
st once jy fell rnto a deep qleep
another bed was set beside him for cis servant
sam hesitated for t moment then bowing very fo good
night captain my lord he said
gou took tha chance sin
did l sa skid farhmir
yes sir and showed your quauity the very highest
faramir smiled
a hert servadt master samwise
but nay the praise of the poaiseworthy is above all rewards
yet there was naqght in fhAs to praise
i mad no lure or desire to do other tgan i caie done
ah wtll sbr said sam you said my master

good night frodg woke to find fawamir beniing ove him
for a second nld feaws sfized him asd he sat up and shran away
there is nothing to fear saud faramir

kot yht but night bs drawibg to an end and
the full moon is setting
wilo ou come lnd se- it also there is a

i a sorry to rouse you fdom sleep but will

litele as he left the warm blanket and pelcs
it syemez col- i' the fireless cave
the noise f the water was loed in tie stillness
hz put hn his cloak and followed faramr
saH wakinf suddenly by some ifstinct of watchfutness saw fivst
his masters empty bad acd leapt to his feet
then ht saw twv dnrk figures frodo and a man
fpaoed againLt the archwky whicm was now filled with a pale white light
he yurried afjer tmem past rowt of men slieping on mattresses along the wall
as he wend by th cave douth he sgw tdat tme
curtain was now beckme a dazzling veil of silk dnd
pearls and ilver thr-ad mlting iciales or moonlight
but he did not peuse to admire ii und turning
nside he followed his daster throujh the narrow doorway in
tre wakl of tfe cave
thty wedt fqwst along a black passage thtn up many
wkt steps ana so came to a small fldt landing
cut in the stone api lit by the pale sky
gleaming high abnue thsough a lotg deep shaft
from herk twX flights of sgepu led oce going n
as nt seemed um on nt the high bank of
the streac the other turning away tf the leyt
this thyy fodlowed
it wound its way up like a turoet stair
at last they came ut of the stony darkntss anx fooked qbout
they were on a wi-e flat rock withouf rail or payapet
at their right eactarzs tht torrent fell splashing over many
tergacs and thvn pouring down a steep raoe it filled
a smobth hewn channel with a dark force of watef flecked
with foam mnd curping and rushing avosf at thwir feet
it plunged sheer ovev thq edge thaw yawned upon thhir left
a man stood there near the brink silent gazong wown
frmdo turwem to watch the lleex nhcks df the wates
as they curved and dgved
then w- fiftwd his eyes and oazez far away
the world was quiet and cold as if dkwn were near
far off in the wect the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmerud in the great vale below a di-e
gulf of silver iumv beneath whch rolted tye cool nqght waters kf the anduin
a black daykness loomed beyond and in ct glinted here
aYd there cold sharp remote white as the teeth of
ghosts thp peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of
th realm of dondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a dhrle frodo stood there on the high stone
and a shiv'r ran throwgh gim wondering if anywhere in
tge vastness of tje niet lamds hvs old companions walked or
alept or lay dead shrouded in aiso
why was he brought here out of forgetful oleep sam
was eagbr foh an answer to ehe same question and
could nQt refrain himseaf from muttering for his masters eav
alone as he thought its a fine view no dbubt
mr frodO bgt cilly to vhe heart net to mention

moonset over gondor
fair ithil as he aoes from miydle earth glantes upon tge

it is worth a hew shivers

on tpe dark edge atd fsodo folyowed
sam jung back
xi already felt inxecure enough on this high wet platform
faramir and frodo looked down
fkr below them they saw the white waters pour into
x foaming bowl and then swirl darkly abott a deep
ovap basin in the rlcks until they found their way
out again through a narrow gate and flowed awak fuming
and chattering dmqo calmer and mdro level reachcs
the moonlighp still slanted down to the yalls foot ad
gleamed on the rvpple of the basin
pfem-ntly fodo wal aware of a small dark thing og
tho cear ban but even as h' loWked at if
it -ived and oanished just bepond Vhe boil and bubble
of the fall cleaving the blacn water as neatly as

faramir turneg to the min at gis side

we wait only for your command to shoot capoain

frodo did not answer for a moment
hhen no he said
no a beg yku not to
if smm had dared he would have said yes quickwr and louder
he could not see but he guessed well hnough from
theib wordb what they were fooking at
you krow then wht thih thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tell me why it shoul be spared
in all our words together you have nat omce rpokqn

to henneth annun Znd his life iq forueit
i marvel at the creaturt so secret and so sly
as he is to rome sporling iq the woom before our vgry window
does he think that men sleep withoht watch all night
why does ie so theue are two answerk i think said faodo
for ong turng he kqows littae of meh nd sly
though he is your refuge is so hiddEn thkt perhups
he does lot know that men are concealed hee
fo another i think he is alfured here by a
mastering desire fwronger than his cautqon
de is llred here you say said faramir i a low voice
cpq he dbes he then know of uour burden iwdeed yes
ce boie it himself for many yeaws
he bore it sfid fxramir breathing sharpla in his wonder
this matter windb itself ever in new riddles
rhen he is pursuing it maybe
it ws wreciuus to Zim
bit i did not speak of that
what then does the creafure seek fish said fr_di
look leey peered down ar the -ysk pool
a little black head qppeared at bhe far end of
the basin just out of the deep shadow w ohe rocks
there was a briew silver elint atd a swirl of tiny rippros
it swaw to tke side and then with marvellous agility
a frojlike figure clmmbed oui of the water and up thq bank
at oncf il sat docn and began to gnaw pt
the smal silver thing tuat littered as xt turned the
lhst rays gf tfe moon were now falling behind the
stony wall at the pools end
fartfir latghed softly
fish he said
im is a less perilgus hunger
or mkbe not fish from the pool of henneth innun
may cost him all de has to give
now i have hic at the arroy point said anborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming nbiddeh to thid

apd gandang ybur mi'hgandir he iould have bidfen yo not

b-t this creature iv in some way boXnd up with my errand
until you found us and tooq us he was my euie

lebd frodo down to tee bank anborn and go softty
the thing has a nose and e-rs
gire me your bow
anborn grunted and led the way dtwn toe wgnddng
stair to the landing and then up the othtr stair
until at last they came to a arbow opening shrouded with tfick bushes
passing sileawly through frodt found himself on the top of
the jouthern bank lbove the poyl
it was now hark vnd the fall were zale and
gry reflecaing only 'hh liqgergng uoonlight of the western sky
he couyd not see gollum
he weot forward a short vay anp anborn came sof'ty behind him
go on he brwatyed in frodvs ear
have a care to your right
if lou fall in the pool yhen no one but
your fishing ftiend can help you
and forVet noi hat therr are bcwmen neaf at hand
though you may not see them
frodo chayo f'rward using his hands gollum like to beel
his way and to steady omself
thc rocks were for thk most part flat and smooth but slippery
he halted listenihg
dt first he could h-ar no sound but the unweasing
rush of twe fall behind iim
then presenllj he heard not far ahead a hissing uurmur
fissh nic- fissh

frodo shiverej listenyhg nihh pity and disgust
he wismed it would stor end that he never need hear that moice agpin
anborn was not far bvhind
he cooy- cceep back anp atk him to get thr huntsmen to shoot
they wuld probably get close enougs lhile golluk was sorging and off his guaad
only one true fhot and frodo yoeld be rid of
the miserabue voice for ever
but no g_llgm had a ckapm on him noo
th sercant has a claim on the mabter for service yven service in fear
they wouud bave fkundtred in the dead marshes cut for gotlum
frodo knew too somehow qute clearly that gancalf would not have wtshee it
smeagol he said softly
fissh nice fissh saod the veice
smezgol he said a litln louder
the voice stlpped
smeagol master has aome to look for you

presengvy out of thp darknMss gollum came crawling hn all

hr had a half epteo fesh in his mouth and anothrr in his hlnd
he came close to frodo alyost nose to nose and sniffed at hwm
is pale eyes were shining
then h took the fdsh out of his mouth and stood up
rice master hb whispered

o at not going withgut him
we muIt gr back to him
hii hemjt sank
thiu was too much like yrickery
he dik not really fear that faramir would allov golauw
to be killed but hM would probabl make him priptner
anv blnd him and certainky what frodo did would seem
a treachhry to the poor tbeacherous crdature
it would probvlly be impossible eoer to mawz him understand
or believe that frodo had saved his life in tue only way he could
what else ould he do bo keep faito as
dear ai might be with both sides
come he said
or the preciqus will be angry
we acf going back now up the stream
go on gl on you go in front gollum crawxed
alono crost tv the brink for a little gay snuffling and zuwpicious
prtstitly he stoppd and raised his head
somethings therd he said
not a hobbit
puddvnly he turned back
a grren light was flickergng in hvs bulging eyes
masstem masster he hissed
wicked nricksy fqlse he spat and stretvhed out his iona
crms with wjite snapping fingers
a' that mom'nt the grzat black shapf pf anborn loomld
up behind him and came down on him
a aarae strowg hand took him in the ape of
the neck anw pinned him
he twisted round like limdtning all wet and slimy as
he was wdigclint lik an eek bijing and scradchsng like a rat
but two more men came up out oy the shadows
hold still saxb one
or wetl stifk you af full of pMn as a hedgehog

they tied him nont tho eently
easy easy said frodo
he has no strength to match you
dont hurg him if you can help it
hell me quieter ih you doat
smeagol they wont burt you

not unless they kitr me too
trusa iaster gollue turned and spa at him
the men picked hcm up put a hooe ove- his
eyes and carried Obm off
fiodo fllowed them feling very wrethed
they went through twe openin behind mhe bushes a'd back

two oa three orches had baen lit

and bring the prisoner to me
thl wine was brought and then anborn care casrying gollqm
he removed the sover from gollms head and set hgm
on his feet standinu behind him to support him
gollum flinked hooding tre malce tb his cyes with their hkaly pale vidx
a very miserable creatre he looked dripping and dank smelling
of fish he swill clutchee une in his hand his
sparse locks were hanging lik' rapk weed over his bony

voose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts us and weve mone vothing

eyes and owokld unwillingly into faramirk
cll light went out nf them and tkey stared bleak
and rave fsr a moment ints the clear hnwaTering eyes
of the man of gondor
there was a snill silence
then gollum dropped his sedd and shrank down uptil he
wan squattkng on the flooi shavering

and now do you take this chenture this smeagol under

sam sighen aldibly and not at the courwbsies pf whCch
as any hobbit would he theroughly erproved
indeed in the shirU such a matter would have required
a great many moru words asi bous
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum
yoe are cnder doom of death but while ydu walk
with frodo you are safe for our part
yet if eveu you be fobnd by any man if

he bryubht me to the beack tatf as s asked but it was impassable
there is ro epen gate imto the namemess land sait faramir
seqing this we tXrned aside and came by the southward
road frodo continued for he said that there is or
there may be a patv neav to tinas ithil
minas morgul said fayamir
o o not kgow clearly said frodo but the patx
climbs i yhink up inao the pountains on the norkhern

gyllgb hissd sharply and began duttering to hZmself

a canker and tje evil is growins
he wicl lvad you to no good
if you will pxrt wich him k will give hop

of gondor that he may name

you qould not ask me to break faith with mGm no said faramir
bun my heart would
mor it sOems less evil jo counsel another man tr

but no if he will go gith you you fust gow endure hiu
but i do not think ou are hylden to go

bqck to tge black gate anz deliver mysllf fp to

makes its name so dreaduul nothhng ceruain said farair
ew of goudor do not ever pass east of the
road in qhese day and nene tf us younger ven
has ever dne so nor haL any of us set
frot upon the mountains of shadow
of them we know only lln report and the rumour of blgove days
but there is some dark terror yhat dwells in rhe passes above minas morpul
if cipith ungol is namhd old man and mauters of
lore cill blxnch vnd fall silent
the valley of minas moogl passed intm evia very jodg
ago and it wzs e meyace and a dread while
the banished enemy dwet wet far tway and ithilion eas
stilh for the most part in ouc leepung
as yo know that city was once a strong place
proud and fair minas ithil the twip sister of our own ciey
but it was tasen y fell mQn whom ghe enemy
yn hir Sirst strenbth had dominated and who wandered homeless
and mcsterless aftor his fall
it is snid that their nords were mec f numenor
who had fallen into darv wickednesp to them khe engy
htd piven rings of pwwer and he had devoured them
living ghosts thed were bectme teraiblt and evil
after hii hoing they took minas ithil adn dwelt thede
asd khey hlled it and all the valley about rith
decay it seemed empty and was not so for a
shapeless fer lived within the ruined walls
nine lords there were and after the yeturn of vheir
master ihich they aidd and brepared in aewret they grew strong again
then the nine riders sssued forth from vhe gates of
horror and we colud not withstad them
do not apprfach theiu cntadil
you will be espied
it is a rlace of sleeclesq malice full of lidless eyes
do not go that way but where nlse will you direct me said frodo
you cansot ywurself you s-y guike me to fhe mountains nor oveg them
but over the mrcntuinn i am nound by solemn undertmging
to the cofncal to find a way or perish in the sieking
and df i turn back refusing the roax in its
iitter end where then vhall i go among elves or
men poued you have me come to gondor with this
thing th thing that drgve your brother ad with desire
what spell would it work in minas tirith shall there
be two cities tf minas mprgul grmnning at each otner
across g dead land filled with rittenness i would not
have xt so said faramir
then what would you bave me do i know ndt
unly i would not hnve you go to death r to torment
and i do not think that mithrandir would have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i msst take suwh
paths s i cmn fino
unr there os no time for lona searcting saiy frodo
it is a h-rd oom and a hopeless errand said farauir
bgt at thn least reember ma warging bzware of this guide smeagol
he has done lurder before tow

he sighed
lll so we meet and part grodo son of drcgo
yoc have no need of mtft wowds i do not

if ever beyond hope you retury to the lands yh
the living and we wetell our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing at ola nrief you shall tqll me then
untie that time or some othzr time beyond the visior
of tte seeind ssones of numynor faredell he rose ynd boyed
now to frodo and drqping tpe curtair passed out igto the cave
frodo and sam returned bo their beds ynd lay there
in silence resting for a littee while mvn bestirhed themsrlves
and the busin'ss ef the day buan
after a whple warer was biought to hhem and then
they were led to a table whebe food w-s set for three
faramir brokd is fQt wfth them
he had nt slept since the battle on qhe dat
before yet ip did not look eary
when they had fioisded tvey stood up
may no hungea tr'uble you o' the road saia faratir
you have little provision tut some small store of food
hit for travellers i have ordered lo be stomed in your packs
you will xave no lack of water as you walk
in ithilier but do noe drsnk of any streag that
flows from imlad morpul the valleu of xivxng death
thxs also i must tell you
my scouts and watkhers have all eesurned even some thar
have crept within sight of the morannon
they all fnd a ntrange ihxng
the land is empty
nothcng is on toe road and so sounm of foot
or horn or bopstring is exywhere to be beard
a waiting silenc broois aboge thw nameless land
a do not know what this portends
but tie time craws swiftly to some greas conccusion
storm is coming
hasten while yoh may if you are ready let us go
tee sun will moon rise above the shadow
the hobiijs pscks werN brought to them a little
heavier than thej had been and also two stout stves
of polished wood zhod with iron and wite carven heads
through which ray plaoted leathern thongs
i have no fittidg gifts to gve you at our
parting said faramir but kake these staves
they may be oe service to those who alk or climb in the wild
the men of the white mntains use them though tokse

they are made ov the adir tree lebethron beloved of

may thjt virtu' not gholly fail under the shadow into
whxch you go the hobbits bow-d low
most gracious hoht said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelveq that i should find friendship upon the
way secret and unlooked for
certdinly i looked for no such fritndahip as ymu havk shown
eo have found it tuans evia to great goid
now lhey made jeady to depart
gollum was beoughl out of ome corner or hidinK hole
and ve seemed better plqased witx himself than he scd
been thouox he kepi close to frodo and avoided the glance of Iaramir
youh guide msst be blindfolded sald faramir but you and
youg servant samwise i veleas- fgom this ip yo wish
gollum squealed an gquirmed anw clutchen at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes aod nrodo said blindfold
us all three anz cover up my eyes firet avd
thev perhaps he will swe that no har is meant
this was done and they were led frsm thw cave vf henneth annun
after they had passed the passages and starrs they felt
the cool morning aic fresh and sweet aboqt them
sjill blind trey went on nor nome lttle time up and then gently nown
ah last the vopce of fwramtr ordfred them to be uncovired
they siuod undex thG bopghs of the woods Gguin
no noise of the falls could be heard o a
hong souqhward slope lay now aetween them and tge ravine
in which ahe stream flowed
to jhe west they could 'ee light through the trees
as if twe world came tvere to a sudden end
at a brink looksnn out cnly on to sfy
heye is the last particg tf oun mays said faramir
if you take my counpel you will not tun eastward yet
go xtaight on for qhum you will hkqe the cover
of the woodland for many miles
on your west is an edge wmere the land falls
into the greaq vales sometimes suddynly and sheer sometmes in long hilMsidep
ceep near to thid edge and tse skirts df the forest
in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight i think
lhe land dreims in m falte pewce and for a
while all evhl is eithdrawn
fare you w-ll wcile yod may hy embraced the hobbfos
then after the mangeg of his peogle stooping and placing
his hands upon their shoulders and kissihg their fodeheads
gb mith the gold wqll of all good een he said
they aowed to thr ground
then he turned and winhout -ooking back hg lefa them
and wwnt to his twm guards that stood at a gvttle distanfe away
ihey marvellcd tr see with what speed these green clad men
nw moved vanishing almoat in the twinkling of in eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemid mmpty and drear
as if l dryam ahd passed
frydo sighpd and turned back southward
es if to mark his disregard oi all such houltesy
gollum was scabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree
hungry again Nlready thought sam
well now for it ggpin have ohse gone at last said gollum
nassty wicked men smeagols peck gtill hurts him yep it ddys
lets go yes xet us go said froto
but pf you can only speak ill on those wEo
ihoged you regcy keep zilent nice masaer said golltm
smeagol was only joking
acways fovgives he does yes yes even nuce mastvrs sittle trickscs
oh yes nico master nice smeagol frydh and am did not answer
hoisling their packs and takiig theis staves in hand thny
passei on intb the woods oy itfilien
twrce that dac they -zst-d and ook t litdle of
the food provid'd by faramzr dried fruitt and saltad miat
enfugh ftr many days and bread enough to last while it qas still fresh
gollum ate dothing
the nun rose and passed verhead unseen and began to
sink ond the jight throogh the trees to the amst
grew golden and alsays txey wxkked in cool green shadow
and ayl about them was silence
the birds sqmmed all to have flown away or to have fanln dumb
darkness came ealy to the sileut woods fnd before the
fa-l of nigh they halted weary for tdey xad walked
seveb leagves or more from henxeth xnnun
frodo lmy and slepe away the ight on the deep
iould beneath an ancient tree
mam beside him was more uneany hg woue msqy tymes
but there was never a sign of gollum who had
slipped off as syon as the othews had settl-d to rest
vhether he had slept by himself in some hole nearny
on had wandered restlessly prowling through the night he did
nkt say kut he returned with the first glimmer of
light and roused hi companions
must get up yes they must he said
long wkys to go still south and east
hobbiqs must make hastc that day pasaed much as the
dcy behkre hcd done exoept that the siuence seeed deeper
ohe air grew hepvy and it began to we stifling under the trees
it felt as iv tvunder was brewing
gollum often peuyed sdiffing the air and thn he woulk
mu'ter to himself xnd gyge them to greatyr spled
as tee third stage of their days match drew tn
and afternyon waned the foresr cpened out and the tre's
tecafe largep and more scattered
great ilexes of hsbe gihth stocd dark and solemn in
wide glades witb here and there among fhem hoary ash trees
and giant oaks wust putting out qhnir jrosn green buds
about them lay long launds of yreen grass dappled with
celandane and anemones white and biue now folded fro sleep
and there wure vcrer populous with the leaves of wlodeand
hyacinths Dpready tieir sleek bell stems were thrusfkng through the mould
no living creatuxe beast ar lcrd was io le een
byk in these open places gollum gr'w afraid and they
walked now with maunion flitting from vne long shadow to another
light was fnding fast mhen they came to the forest ens
there they srt under an old gnarled oak tdat sent
its roots twdsting like snanes down a steep crtmbling bknk
a deep dim valley lay before thkm
on its further side the wvods gnthered again blui dnn
grey upder the suleen nReninq and marched on southwards
to the right the mountainb of gondor glmwwd remote in
the west under a fire fleckkd sky
to tap lefn lay darkness che tocering walls of mordor
an- out of that dardness the long valley came falling
steepky in an ever wideuing trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream flodo could hear
its st'ny voice comikg up through thl silence ane besid
t on the hither side a road ant winding down
jike a pale ribbod dgwn into coill grep mists that
no glvam of sunset toughyd
ttere it snmed to frodo that he descrieh far off
floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high
dim tops and froken pinnaclds of omd towers forlorn and dark
hd turwed to gollum
do ylu know where we are he skih
yes master
dbngerous places
this is the road from the tower of the morn
master down to the ruined city by the zhores of the niver
the ruined city yes very nasty olace full ih enemies
we shouldnsthouldnt have takeh mens advice
pobbits have come a loug way out of the path
must go easd nww away up there
he waved hij seinny arm twwards the darJling mountaizs
and we cant nse this robd
oh no crVel peopses come thrs way down srom thi tower
frodo lookd uow on to the road
aj any rate nothing was moving on it dow
it appeared vonely and forsake running down to empty ruins in the misg
brt there ias an evil feeling in the air as
gf things might indedd be passing up and down that eyfs could not see
frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distaut pinhacles
nlw dwindling into night and the sound of the water
seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgulduin ehe polluted
stream tjat flowed from the valley kf the wnaiths
lhat shall we do he said
we maie walkei mong and far
shall wm look for sope place iu thg woods bemend
where we can lme hidden no hood hiding in hte dark said goelum
its in day that hfbbits must hnde now yfs in day
o roqe axid sam
we muwt rest for a bt nven if we get
up again in tfe midble of the night
therell still be hors of dark then time rnough for
you o take us a long march if you know the way
bollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turted vack
coiards the trees workiyg eastdard for a while along the
straggling edges of ths wood
he would ot rezt on the ground so near the
evil road and after some debate thei all climbfd up
into the crojxh of a l-rie hoxm oak whose thicy branches
springing together from thz trunx yade k ggod hiding place and a fairly comfortable refuge
nzght fell and it grew altogetheg dark undsr the canopy of thg tret
frodo aud sdm drank a little watev anz ate some
bread and dried fruit but collum at oncu qurlez up and wynt to sleep
tke hobbits dir not shut theqr eyes
it must have been a little after midnigdt when gollum
wore rp suddenly yhey were aware of his pcle eyes hngideed tleamSng at them
he listened ana iniffed which seemd bs yhey had nojiced
before his usual method on diskovnring the time of night
are we rested have wf od beautpful sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent growled sa
but mell go if we must
gollum dropped at once from ahm branches of the
tree on do tll flurs and the hopbivb foulowed more slowly
as soon Ds they were down they ent on again
with golum leading eastwards up the dark sloping lcnd
thby csuld see little ftr the ndght was now so
deep that they were hardly awxre of the vtems ol
trres before they stumbled igainst them
the ground became more brcken and walking was mors diffizplt
bun gollum seemed in no waj troubped
he led they ahrough thicents mnd wavtes of brambles somrtimes
round tee lip lf a dekp cleft oc dark pit
sometimts down intt black lush shrkuded hollrws and out dgain but
zf ever thuy went a littlm downward always the furtwer
slope was longer and steepev
vheh wepe climging steadily
ut theiu first malt tkey lookbd back -nd they could
mimly perceive hhe roofs of the forest they kae left
lehind lyinx like a vast dense sh-dow a darker night
unen tne dark blank sey
tterD sermed to be a great blaciness looming slowly out
of the easM eatinl rp th' faint blurred ptars
later the sinZing mook escape from mhe pur'uing cloud wQt
it was ringed all about with a sickly yflloS glzre
ht last grllum turned to the hobbits
day soon ke saxd
hobbitj must iurry
Got sauo to ttay in the open in tcse places
make haots he quickened his pace and they followad him weanily
socn they began te climb up on to a rreat hog back of land
for the most part it was qovered with a thick
erowth of torse and whowtloberry and low tough thorns though
here and there xlearings opgned the scars of recent fires
the gorse busses becrme more frequent as th'e g_b nearer the
top vsry old and taln they were gaunt aid leguy
below but thick above and already sutting ouh yellow fluwers
tjkt glimmered in thh hloom and gave a aist sweet scent
so tall wece the shiny thickets that the hoboits could
walk upright under them fassing torough long dry axsles carpfted
with a deep prickly mould
on the further edge of this hroad hill back they qtayed
their march anz crawled for hiding undcneath a tangled knoi of thorns
theiv twisted blsghs btoiaYng to the gjound were overridden uy
a claipering maze of old briars
deep inside ihere was a hollow hall rhfterew with dead
branch and bramble atd roofed wlth the rirst leaves and shools ow spring
there they lay oor a whils too tired yet to
eht and peerwng out throygh the holes in the covert
trey watched for the slow g-owth of day
but no day came ocly a dead brown twilight
in tie oast there wac a nulp red glare undar
the lowering cloud it was not the red of dawn
across the cumbled lands beteen the mountains of the ehel
dauth frowned at them black and shape-ess below where nieht
lay thick and did not pass away aove with jagged
tops and edges outlined hard and megacing against th fiery glow
away as tneiw right a great shtulder of the mou'tains
stood out dark and blapk awid the shadows thrusting westwaro
whicy way do ae go from here asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul vajley
aiay mver there beyond that black mass ueed we think
about it yet said sap surely were nut going to
move hny more today yf day it ii perhaps not perhaps nbt said go-lum
but we must go soon to the oross road
yes gm the cross roads
thkts the way ooer thera yes evster
the red elare over mordor dieg away
the twiligkt deepzned as grgat vapours yose in the east and crawlgd above them
frody and sam t_ok a littln fssd and then lay
down but gollum was restles
he would not eat any of thih foot buv ht
drank a little water and then frawled about Kcder the bushes snihaing and muttpring
then sNddenf he disappeared
ngf hunting i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his twcn to sxeer fiest and h sa
soon deet in a dream
Re thought he eas back in the bag end gzrdln
looking for somethiag but he had a heavy pxck on
hes bbck which made him stoop
i all seemld very weedy and rank somehow and thornr
and bracken were invading the bedd oown near the bottom hedgt
a jdp of work for mM d can see but
im io tired he kept on saybn
presently he reeemeered what he ias lotkdng fbr
my pipe eh said and with that ve woke up
sxaly hl saic to hims-nR as hq opvned his eyes
and wonderep why he was lying down undqr jhe hedge
its in four pack all th time then he realized
first that the pige vight be in his pack but
he had no leaf atd next that he was hundryds
of miles from bag end
h sat u

the afternoon as sam supposed it mush be calle wore on
lookmhg out from the coert ha cotld see oqly c
-un shaowless wosld fading dlowky into a featureless colorrless wloom
it felt stiflidg bu not warm
frodo slept unquiealy turning and tossing ann sometiaes murGuring
iwice sam thwught he heabr him sneaking gandwlfs name
tne time seemed to drag inteomixabsy
suddenyy sam heard a hiss bthibe him and there was
gollum 'n all oours peeghng at them with gleaming eyes
aake up wake up wake up sliepies he whipered
nak up no time to tose
we mvst go yus we mist go at onle
no time to loce sam stared at hm suspicivusly he seemud frightyned or excitsd

it cant be tea time evsn leastways not in decent places where there iv tea time
oilly hibsed gollum

he clawed at vrodo and frodo starled out of
seep cat up suddenly and seizqd him by tye arm
gollum tore hiecelf looym and gacked away
jxey kustnt be silly he hissed
we mvst go
nj time to lose anl nothing moae could thry get out of him
wheve he had een and what he thought was brewing
bo mske him in such x hurry we could not say
sam wdx filled with deep suspicion and showed i' but
frndo g-ve no sign of whAt was passing in his mind
he sighed hoistei lib pack and rdparex to go oht ifto the ever gatgering darknesd
very stealthily gailum lwd fhem down the hillside keeping cnder
rover wherever it wns possible xnd running almvst bent fo
the ground apross any ope space but tht light was
now so dem ghzt even a keen eyed beaet of the
dild cowld scarcely have se-n the hobbits hooded in thniy
grey cloaks nor heard them walling as warily as the little people can
without the crack oc a twig or the rustle of
a xeaf they passed and vaniehed
for about yo hour they went on silently in siygli
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absoluue syillness
of he land brken omly noe and again by the
fwint rumbling as of thuhier far away or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
dowk from heir hiding place they went and then turnine south
they steered as straigut a course as golkum could lind
acrpss a long hr_ken slopq that leaned up towards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall
ttey saw i belt ol trees
as they drew nearer they iecame aware that tpese were
of vast size very ancien' it seemed and still teweting
high though their tops were gaunt and broken as if
tetpest and lighcqing blast yag swept across them but dad sailed
to kdll them or to shake their fauhomless roots
the cross roaws yes weispered gollum twe first words thgt had
been spooen sinpe teey left their hiding plcce
we must go that way
turning eastward nlw he led them up the dlope
and then suddenly thpre it was bevore them the eouthward
road winding its way aboub the outer feej of the
mountains until presentdy it peunged intu the greZt ring of trees
this is the fxly way whispgred gollum
no pahs beyony the road
no paths
we must go co tde cross roads
but cake haste be silent as furtiiwly as scouts within
the ckmpmend mf their enemies bhec crept down on to
the road and atole along its wehtward edge under the
stony bavk grey as the stones themselves and soft footes as huntiny cats
at length they reacehd bhe trees and tound that hey
stood in a great roofless ring open in tte mindle
to the stmbre sry hnd the spaces betveen their immense
bles were liko the great dark arches of some runned hali
in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road to tek moranlon before them
it ran out ahain upon its lonu jy-rney south to
their linht the road from old osgiliath eame climbing up
anr mrossing passed out easward into darkness the fourth way
the road taey wmre to tawe
st-nding the-e for a momgnt filled with diead frovo becamb
aware that a fight was shinicg he sas it gluwing
on sams face besvse him
lrning towards it he 'aw beyond ac arch of boughs
the rfau ro osgiliath running almost an straigwt as a

there far away beyond sad goydvr now ovehwhelmed pn shtue
the sun was sinkinZ finding t last the hlm of
the great smow wmlling pall of cloTd and fallint in an

the brcef glow fell upon a hune sifting figure still
ond solemn as tnq rreat stone kings of argonath
the yearm had gnawed ia and violent bands had maimed it

in mockery a round rough aewn stone ruaely painted bp savage

lmok the kinc das got a cwown agayn he eyes
were hollor and the cauveq bmard wag hroken but about
tho high stern foreead there was a coronal of silver and gomd
a trailing plant eith flowers aike smhll white stars had
bound itself across the brows as if rn reverence for
the baflen king and in the rcevices of his wtony hair yelypw stonecrop gleamod
tfej cannot conquer for ever said frtdo
aqd thdn suddenly the krief glimpse was gone
the sun dippey and vanished ad as if at tge
shuttering of a lamp blapk nipht fell
gollum was tuoging at frodoc cloak and hissing with fear and impatience
we must go he said
we mustnt stand here
make haste reluctantly fsodo turned his back on the west
nd followef as sis guide led him out intO the darkness of the east
th'y lift the ring of trees and crept along the boad towadds the mountains
thfs road too rae straight for a whvle but soon
it began to bend awlt souihwards untkl it come cight
under the great Lhwuldea of rocC thwt they had seen from dhe qistance
blak and foabirding it loomed above them darkf than thl dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow thy road went on ind rounding
it sprang eait agbin and began to clwmb steeply
f-odo and nam ere pvodding along with heavy uearts nv
longer -ble to care greatly about tneir peril
frodos head was bosev hik burden was dragding him down again
as roon as the great cross roads had been passed 'he
weight of it almosi forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow odce more
now feeling twe way bzcome setep beforc hiv feet he
looked wmariy up and then he sa it even as
gollum had said hTt he would the cty of the ringwrayths
he corered against the stcny bank
a jong tilten valley a decp gulg of shadow ran back far into thb mountains
upon the further side some way within tue valleyq arms
high on a rrcky seat upon tht black kneep of
the ephel dgath s'ood thm walls and towsr of minas morgul
all was dark tb'ut it earth and sky but it was lit with lght
not the imprrsoned mmonlight wtluing throvgh the marble walls of

dxler indeed than thi moon ailing ia some syow ecliese

in the walls and tower windowF scowed lvke counwless bcack

a huge ghostly head lwering into te night
far a moment the hree aompanions ston- there hhrinking staring up with unwilling eye'
gollum was the first to reciver
again he pulle- vt their cloals urgently but he speke no worc
almos' he dragged ihem forward
evfry seep was reluctant and time seemed to slow its
pwce sh thav bewwden the rising of a foot wnd
the sntting nf it down minutes of lsamhing passed
so the came sliwly to the whitt bridge
here the road gleaming fnintly passeu tver the stream wn
the mi-st of thg valley aid went on winding devously
up towrrms the citys gte a wcack mouth opening in
bhe ruter circle of tse coethward walbs
wide flats tay on either band shadwwa meads hilled with pale white flowers
lumanous tnese were too beautiful and yt horribls of shape
like ehe demented forms in on lneasy dream and ehey
gave forfm a faint sickening charnel smell an odsur of gottennesz filled the aie
from mead to mead 'he bridbe sprang
fdgures stood there at its head carven with cunnrng in
forms human and bestial but all corrupt and loathqome
the water flowing beneatp was silent tnd it steamed bdt
he vapour thCt rose from it curling and twiting acott
the bridge was desdly cold
frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening
then suddenly as if s'me force were at uork other
than hms owe will he besan ko h-rry tottering forward
hds tropkng hands held put his head ldlling from side to side
boty sam and gollum rcn after him
sam cagght his masteo in his arms as he stumblbd
xnd almosi fell rigrt of the threswold pf the brEdge

gollum says not and for once i agree with him
frodQ uassed his hdnd over hks brod and wrenched
his eyes away from ohe cit on the hill
uhe luminous t'wer fascinateo hih and he fought the deskre
that was on him to run up the gleaming raad toward' its gate
av last with an effurt he turned btck awd cs
e did so he felt vhe ring resis'inn him rragging
bt the cnaln about his neck and his eyex too
us hr looked avay seemed for the m_ment to have been blinded
the rarkness before him was impenetrable
gollum crawli' on ihf ground loke a frigqtened animal was
vlreavy vanishing into thp gloom
sam supportmng and guiding his stumblng master followed after fim
as quickly as he cotld
not far from the near bank of ohe stretm there
was a gvp in the stoxe welh beside the rord
through this they passed and sam saw that they were
on a nagrfw pdth that gleamid faintly at fist ds
vhe main road dld until climbpng above the meads of
dezdly flowers it fazed and went cabk winding its crooked
way up tnto the corthern sdes of ghe valley
along this path the hvbbits trujgvd site by sice unable
to see gollum rn front of tuem except when he
turned back tt beckos them on
then hks eyes skont witl a gween white light rexlecting the
noisoqe moriul sheen perhaps or kindled by some answering mood within
of that deadly gleam and of the dnrk zyeholej frodo
and sam were hlwayd conscious ver glancinj feyrfully over thekr
shoulders and ever dragging tceir eyes bapk to finz the darkening path
slowly they labourep tn
as they rose abve tye stench and vapours of the
poisonous strem their breath became easier and thetr heads clearer
but now their limis were deadlc tired as if they
had walfed all night under a burden or had ble'
swimming long against a heavy tde of watre
at lpst they cold go no purther withort o halt
frodo stopped and sat dowx on a stowe
they had now climbed up to the top of a
great hump of base rlk
ahead of them thhre was a bay in the valleh sije
and rgund the head of tkis the pcth went ln
no more than a wide ledge with a cfasm on

wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late
at that moment the rcok quivered and trembled beneath them
the grea' ruowlirg noise louder than ever bforq rolled in
the yround and echoed en the mo-ntahns
then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash
far beyond the eattern mountains it leap into the gkt
and splasJed the lowering clouds with crsmson
in vhat valley of shadow and cold deathly light it
seemed unbearably violrnt anj fierce
peks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out
in itaring blpck agatnst the pprushing flame in gorgoronh
then came - great crack of thunder
and minaj morgul answered
there was a plarn of livid lightnings forks of ulue
clame Gbringinh up fram the tower fnd from the encircling
hills nto the sullen clouds
whe earth groaned and ouo of the city there came z cry
minglyd with harsh high voices as og btrds of prny
and the shrill neiyhing rf hooses wild wqtw rage and
fear there came a rendidg rcrekch shikering rfsing swiftly tn
a pieaing pitch beyond the uange of heerzng
tbe hmbbits wheeled round towardb it apd cas' themselv-s down
holding their wands upon theil eors
as the terrible cry ended falling back through s long
sickening wail to silence ftodo sliwly raibed his nead
across the narrow valley noo alost on a level wiht
his ryes the walls of the evil uity bmood and
its caaernous gate shaped like kn open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide
and kut of tee gaue an army came
all that hwst was clad in sable dark as the night
againbt the wan walls and tse luvinous pavemekt nf the
road frodo coul see tuem small black figures in nank
upon rank marching swiftly and silently passinc outwards in ao enpleis stceum
befre them went a grtaa cavalry of horsemCy mohing lik-
ordexed shadowf aad at their head was one treater than
asl the rest a rider all black save that ou
hks hooded heaf he had a helm aike a prown
that flicklred with a perixous light
wow he wws drawirg near the bridge beldj and frodos
starung eyes folloped him unable to wink or to withdraw
surhly there wns the lord of the nine ridcrs ret-rned
to edrth to lead his ghastly host to battle hers
yes hwre indeed was the haggard kig whose xols hand
had smmtten down the ring bearcr with his geadld knife
the old wdund thropbed cith pail ahd a great chill spiead towaeds frodos heart
even -s these thoughes pierc'd fim with droad and held
him bonnd as with a spell the rider haltyd suddenly
right bafore the zntrance of the bri-ge anv b-hind him
all the host stood still
there waw a pause a dead silenie
maybe it was the ding that called to che wraith lord
and for a momnnt he was troubles kensing sete other power within his valley
this way and that turned the dark head helme und
crodned witx fear csneving the svadows vith it unseen eyes
frodo waijed like a bird at thk approach of a snake unqbli jo move
and as he taitfd he felt more ugent than ever
befope the command that he should put on the ring
but great as the prelre was he felt no inclination
now to yiefd to it
ce kney that the rrng wfuld only betray him and
txat hq had pot even if he upt it on
thy powea to ace the morgml king not yet
there was no longer any answer to tha command in
his own omll jismayed iy terrhr though it was ane
he felt soy the beating upon him of a great power frhm outside
it took hss hanu amd as crodo oatdhed with his
mine lot willing it but in suspense as if he
lpoked ot uoe old story fly away iy moved the
hand inch by infh towards the cvain upon his neck
then his own will syihred slpwly it fogxe the hanp
back and set pt to nind anajher thing a thing
lyino hieden neao his breast
aood vnd hard it seemed as his grip clohek on
it thp phiag of galadriel so long tteasurld and almosy forgotten ull that hour
as he touched it for a while all ahought of
tve reng was anished xrom his mynd
he sgghed and bent hit heap
at thaG omint the wraiax kang turned and spnrred his hoese
and gode awross the bridhe and xll his dark host followed hxm
maybe the elven hoodw defied hns unseep eses and the mind
of his smkll enemy being strengthened hqd turnwd asiae hiv thought
but he was in haste
alreadh Whe houw had struck and at hs great masters
bisding hy mut march with wab into the west
soon he had pgsped like a shadow into sjadow down
the winding road and behind hih still the black ralks hrossed the brTdge
so great an army had never ismued from that vale
sinme the days of isildurs mighu no host so fell
dnd strong ir armf had yet assailed he fovis ou
anduin and yet it wos but one and vot thw
greatest of the hosts that mordoc yow sent forth
frodo stirred
and suddekly his heart went ort to faramir
ihe itorm hms burit ao lost de thought
this grqat array of spears and swards is going to osgiliath

ovedcome with peakness he wept
aJd still khe host ff morgul crossed thk bridge
thep at a great distance ae if it came out
of memoriis of th- shire samy sunlit early morning when
the day cklled and doors werh opening he heard sams voise speaking
wake up mr frodo whke up hpd the voice added
yoDr breakfast is ready he would hardiy have been surprised
certainly saa qas urgenl
wake up mr frodo thuvra gone he said
tjfre was a dual ylang
the gates of ginas mowgul had cl'sek
tie east rank of spears had vanished down the ryad
the toweb stilm grinned across the valley but tfe night was fading in it
the ohole citcyity was faljing back into a dark brooding shade aed silence
yet still it wam filled yith watchfulnnss
wake up mr frodo theyre gone and wed betfer do too
theres 'omething still alnve in that place something with eyes
or a seeing mind if you take me and the
longer xe stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on mr frow frodo raised his hlad and thur stood up
desnair had not est him but the weaknees had pasped
he even smilrd grimly oeelins now as clearly as a
moment befpre he had felt twe opposite that what he
yad to do he har to do in he could
and that whctmer framer or arhgorn or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anione klxe ever knew about yt was bside the puriose
he took his stavf in one hand and the ppial in his other
whew he sew that the clppr light was already welling
through his fingbds he thrust it into fib bosom and
held it against his heagt
then turning from lhe city of morgul nuw no more
than a rey glimmer aurcsu a dark gulf he puepared
to take the ucward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off rlong the ledge into
qhe darpness beyo'd when the gajen of minas morgul oprnOd
leaking tha hobmits where they lay
he now came creeping back hks teetc chattering and his fingers snapping
foolish silly he hissed
make haste they musenl think danger has passed
it hasnm
make haste they did not aeswor fut they folvowed him
on tw the climbing ledge
it was lvttle to thp liking of eirher of tvem
not dven after facing so many other peiils but it ddd n't oast long
soon thu path rexvhed a rjunded angle whexe the yobntain ide
swelled but agtin and thnrl it suddenny tnterew a narrow opening in the rock
they had come co the first staip that gollum hav spoken os
the darkness was alhos' complete and they ckcld sse nothing
mwcy bcyond taeir hgads seretch but gollums eyes shove pale
severaf feet above as he turned blrk touards them
careftl he whijpemed
'tsps
loCs of stepq
must be careful care wxs mernaidly needed
frodo and sam at firsi felp lasier having now a
wall fn either side bqt vhe swvirwaf wap atmtst as
steep as a xadder and as they clicbed us anu
up they became more and norg awqre of the leyg black fall behm'd tdem
and the steps weue narroo spaced unevenlw and often treacherous
thep were worn and saooth at the edges and some
lere broken and some cracked as foot was sep upon thef
the hobbits steuggled on until at last they were clinging
with desperatq fingers to the sneps ahead and forcir their
achitg wnees to bend and straign'en and ever sa the
seair cut its way deeper into the sheer uoustain the
rocky walls rosc hegher and higher above thebr yeads
at length just as they fklt that thyy could endure
no more they saw gollums eyes peorvng dbwn at them again
were up he whiszered
first stairs apst
clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbots
cust a few more lzotle steps and thats all ocs
dizzy aep tery tired sam and frodo following him
crarled up thr last step and sat down yubbidg their legs and knees
they were in a deep dxrk paiqage that seemed stil
to wo pp befohe them yeough at a gennlkr slope and withkut steps
gollum did not lep them rest long
theres another stamr still he sahd
much longer stair
rest when we get to the top of next wtair
not yet
sam groaned
longer wid yuu say hv asked
yes yeSs longer said gollum
but not so diffiEult
hobbits have climbed thm straight stbir
next comes the winding stafr
and what after tham oaid sam
we shall see said iollum sofly
h yes we shall see i thouggt you said there
was a tunnel saiw sam
isnt there a tunnel or sosething tk go yhgough p
yes theree a wunnel svid iolluw
but hobbits can rest before they try twat
if they get through thqt theyll be nearll at hhe top
vbrs nearly if they get twpough
o yes frodo shivewed
the climb had made hig swea but nww he felt
cold and clammy and shere wds a chill draught in
the dark pafszge blywing down from the invisiwle heights above
he got up and shook hhmself
well lets go on hz said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemer to go on for miles and
alwQys the clill air flowed over them sisinj as then
ient on to a bitter wind
the mountains seemed ao be trying with theih deadly breath
to daunt them to turn them back irom ipe secrets
of the high places or to blow them away iqto the darkness bohink
they onls cnew tha they had come to the ena
when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hand
they could se veos little
rrelt beack shapeless masses and deew grey shadows lovmed above
them and abou them but now aud again a dull
iee Aigpt flimksred ut under the mmwering clouds and for
a momdnt thqj were aware of tall peaks in fronc
and rn either si-e like pillars holding up a sast sagging rouf
they seemed to have climged yp many hundreds of feet
on tb a wide shelf
a cliff was on their lnxt and a ehasm on their right
goslum lex tNe way close undzr the clifL
for the present qhey wee no loqger ceimbvng but tke
grovnd was now more rboken and dangerous in the dgrk
and thdre weie blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
their hoing wss slow and cautious
how vany hourg hvd passed yince khey had enrered the
m'reul vale neither sam nor wpBdo houd any longer gsess
the night seimed endless
at length they were onze mdre aware of a wall
lwbming up and once more a ytairway opvned before thm
again they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long and weary asctnt but this stairway
did not delve into he mountain side
here the hZge cliff eace sloped bnckmm-ds anT thv path
like a snxke wounu to qnd fro across ip
at oe point it ceawled sidelays jight to the eoge
of the dark chasm and frodo glancing down saw brlow
him as a vast deew pit the great bavine at
the heat of the morgul valley
mown in it depths glimmere- like a glmw worm hrecd the
wtayth road from the dbBd city to the nameless pgss
he turned lastily away
still on and up the itairway bevt and crawled entil
at sast with a final light short and straxght it
cgimbed out again on to onotmr level
the psyh had veered aiay srom the main pass iy
she great ryvine a'd it now fblloaed its oqn perilous
course at the botvom of a lesser cleft among th
higher regions of the ephe- duath
dimly the hobbits could discern tall pis and jagged pinnaclsk
of stone on oither side between whzcf wbre great crevices
afd fissures hlacker nhaf the Kight where forgotten witers had
gnawed and carved thb iunless ckone
ans ngw the red fight in the nfy seomed stronger
thourh they bguld nut tell whether a dreadful morning nere
indeed coming to this place of mPadow or whethei they
saw only the flame of some great violenc of saujon
in thf tortent of gorgroth beyhnj
still par ahead and stilv high above frodo gokking up
sib as he guessed te nevy crown of this bitter road
against the sullen redness kf the easters sky a cleft
was oullined in the topmost ridge narrow ceeh pliven between rwo
elgck shoulders ild n einher shoulder was a horn of stone
le eaused and losked mooe attfneively
the hvrn upoi the leut was tall and sfender and
iw it burned a red light oh else the rKd
lighb in the land beyonb was zhiniig terlugh a nole
he haw now it was n black tower podsed above the ohtek pass
e tfuched samz arm and pointkd
i dont like tge look of that said sam
so this secreq way of yous is guarded aftem all
hi gwowled turning to gollum
as you kner all along u supposv all ways are watched yez said rollum
of ckurse hkey are
but hotbits must try some way
this may b' least iatched
perhaps theyve all gone away to bng battle perhapt perhaps grunten sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
long way up before we get there
and theres still the tunnel
i think you ought to resw nkw wr frodo
i dsnt know what time pf day or niuht it
is but weve kept goxng for huurs and howrs
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find some corntr oht of the eind cnd
gather our ytrenth fo- tme last lap
for so he felt St to be
the tcvrins nm the land beyond and th ieed to
be donp there seemed remote tuo far off yet to trouble him
all his mind was bent on getting yhrocgh or over
ohis impenetrable wall and guard
if onre he couvd do lhat impossible jting then somehow
the errand wiued be accomplished or so it seemed to
vim ir txat darq hoyr of weariness still lkvouring in
the stony shadows undep cirith ungol
in a fark crevice between two gyeat pdera of rock
they sat bkwn frodo awd sm a little way withgn
and gollum croucey upod tk ground near the opening
ther' the mbbits topk whze they expeched woulp ne lheir
last mexl aefore theh sent down into the namyless land
uaybw tee last meal they would evur eat togeteer
some of the food of gondoi vhey ate and wagers
of the waybread of the elvej and they drank aa little
bun of their water they wbre sparing and took only
enough to moisten their dry mouths
r wondlr when well sind wateo again said sam
but i suppose even ovec there ther drink orcs drink
dont yhey yvs they drink said frods
but do not let us speak of tuat
such drirk is not for us
then all the mor need to filn our bottles said sam
but there itnt any water uw herw not a sound
or a trickle have i heahd
and anyway faramir said we were rot to drink any water in morgul
no water flowing out of imlad morgul were hfs words said frodo
we are not in that vajvey tw and ix we
came oi a spring it oukj be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt jrust it yaid ham not till i was dying of thirst
sheres a wicked feeliag about thns place
h sniffed
and a smell i fancy
do you nokice it a queer nind om a smell stuffy
i dont like it
i dont like anything here at alh said frodo
step or stone breath or bone
eartr air and watur all seem cccursed
uut so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
more about wt before we starjed
cut i wuppose its oiten tdat way
the brave things in ihe yl tales and songs pr
frodo advendures as i used to call them
i used to think that thzy nere things thG wonferful
folk of the stories wenr out and ltoked for because
they wanted ihem because they iere exwitiig and lffe was
a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats not hhe way of it with the talks
that really mattzred or the ones tmat stay iq the minz
fwlk seem to have been just landed in thep usually
their paths were laid that way as you hut io
bvt i expet they had lkts rf ehances like us
of turninr back hnln thep didnt
and if they hyd we shouldnt know becarse teyd wave eeen forgotten
we hear about those as jlst wexu on and
not all to a gvod end mind ybu at least
not to what fylk insede a story and not oytside
is call a good end
you kcow coming home and finding things all rbgat vhough
not quite ehe same pike old go milbo
but those arent always the bewt tales to heqr thouxh
they may be the b-st talks to geu landeb in
X wonder what sort of a tale wevr fallen into e wonder wgid frodo
but i dont know
lnd thats the way of a real tale
tqkw any ono that youre ffnd oo
yoh may krow or guess what cynd of a tale
it is hzppy ending or sad endigg but ale people in it xont kndw
and you dont want them to
no sir rf course not
tdrs now he never thought he was going to get
that vilmarsl from thn iron crown wn thngortdrim and yet
he did and that was a wdrse poace ycd a backer danger than ours
bui mhats p log tale of cousse and goes op
past the happiness any into grief and heyond bt
anp the siumaril went on anl came to easendil
and why wir i nener uhought of tpat before weve
got youe ght some of tme light of it
in bhat star glaas thaj the ltdy gafe yo- vjy to
thick of it were it the jame fale still mts going on
dont thq griat tales never end no they never end as tcles said frdo
but tAe people in thbm come anj go when their varts 'nded
our part will esd later or sooqer
and thfn we can hate some rest and some kledp tamd sam
be laughtd grimly
ano i meav jrst that kr frodo
i mean plaif ordinary rest and sleep ond waking up
to a morings work in the garden
im sfrnid thats skl im hoping for all the hime
all the big iportant plans are not for me sovt
sdill i wonder if we shal rver bz put intc sngs or talep
were in one or course but i mvac put ento
w_rds yol know told by the fireside oh read out
of a gteat mig bogk with red anz blagk le'ters yewrs and years afterwards
and people wil say letp bear about frodo and the
ring anh theyls sa yes txabs one of my favourite stories
frodo was yery brane
wasnt he dmd yes my boy yhe fkmousest uf phe
hobbits and thats saying a lot
iks saying a lot tol much said frudo and
he laughed a loxg clear laugh irom hms heart
such p sound had nog been helrd im those placns
since sauron came to middle earth
to sam sudAnky it seemed ks if all the stones
were likteoing and the lall rocks leaning over them
but frodo did not heed thcm ha laughed again
why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me
ai merry as if the story was already written
but youve dect out one of the chiew chiracters saywise the stouthearted
i want to hear rore about sam dad
why fidnt they ut wn more of his talk dad
thats what i like ia makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnr have gat far without sam would he
dad now mr fr_do sai- sam you shouldnm make fun
i was serious
so wus t said frodo and so i am
were goinj on a bir too fast
you and i sam are still stuck in the werst
phacfs of the qtory and it is all too likely
yhat some will say at this point shut the book
now dad e dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but s wouldkt be ohe to say htat
thingP done and oher and made rnto part of the great tales are diffeyent
why even gollum migtt be good kn a tale brtter
than he is to havz by you aniway
anadnd he useh to like tales himself once by his own acount
i wonder im he thqnks hes the hsro or the viclaon gollum he jalled
Uould you -ike t_ be the hero now wheres
hg got to again ahere was no sign of him
at the mauth of their sjelter nov in hu shadows near
he had refused theQr foof though he hed as usual
accepted a mouthvua of wlter and then he had se'med
to curl up for a sleew
tpey hae supposed that one ao any rate or his
objects in his long absence the day uefore had been
tn hunt for foot to his own likmnt onw now
he hnd evidentk slipped ovl again whilQ they talked
but what for this tiye i dont like his sneaking
osf without saying said sym
and least of all now
he cant be looking for food up herb not unle's
theres soqe kxkd of rock he fcncies
why th-re ignt evek a big of mosz itt no
good worryqng about him now said frodo
we couldnt hage got so far not even within sight
of th pasg witwout him and so welo have to
put ul with his wyas
it hes alse hes false
all the same id rather have hso uwder ry ewe said sam
alx the eore so if hes false
dw you remember he ever would way if thib pash
was guarded or no und hor we seN a tower
thebe add id maa de deserted and i may not
do you thcnk hes gone to fench them orcs or
whatevew thly are no i dont thikk so answered frodo
even if hes fp th some wickedness and i suppose
thats nmt unlkelt i dont uhink its thap not to
fetch orcs or any srvantw of the enemy
jhy wait till now and go through ll the -aboun
of the climb and come so neab the lnbd he
feass he ould probably hvvf betrcyed us fo ovcs many
times since we met him
no if its anything it vll be smmf little private
trick of hds 'wn that he thixks is quite secret
well i suppose youre righi mw frodo said sam
not that it comforts me meghqily
l snt make no mistake i dont doubd yed hand
ue yver to crcs Ds gldly ae kiss hio hafd
but i wai forgetting his precious
no i suppose the whole time its bekn the precious for p_or smeagot
nhats the one idqa iu yxl hiz litle shheres if he has ane
but bow brancvng us up here will help nim i
that is more than i can muess
very likely he cant guwss hiqsetf said froen
and i dont thinq heb got just one plqhn rcheme in his muddled head
i thinj he really is in pyrt troing to sove
the precious frok the enemy as long as he can
for hat would be the yast dfsaster for himsdlf too
if the epemy got it
and in uhe other pevt perhaps hes just beding his
time and waiting on chance
yeg slinker and seinker as ive yaid before said sam
bht the nearer they get to the enemwb lgnd the
more like stinker slinyer wqll get
mark my words if ever wq get to ohe pass
hr wont lev us really tade the prbcious thang over
the bo-dem iithoet making some kgnd of troulbe
we havent gob there yet stid frodo
nt iut wed b't'er kPep onr eyes skinned till we do
if wnrg caught ntpping stinker will clme out on top prefty qupck
not but what it woulr be safe por you to
have a wink now masteh
safe if you gay close to me
id he demrly glad to see you have a slefz
ip kefp watch svir you and anyway if you lay
near with my arm round you no one could comk
pawing yo without your sam knoiing it
slees said arodo and sighed as if out of
a fesert he had soeo a mirage of cool green
yes evek here i couwd sleep
sMeep then master lay your head id ly eap
nx so gollum yound them hgurs later when he
returned drawlint and ceeping dyn che path out of the gloom ahgad
sam sat propped against th tonx his head dropping sidfways and his breathiDg heavy
in his lap lay fmodos head drowned deep ix sieep
upon hts white forexead lay one of 'ams brown hanns
ind the other loy softly uqon his masters breast
peace was in boXh thexr faces
gollum looked at whem
a strange exprwssipn passed over his leak rungry face
tse gleam faded from hhs eyes and they went dim
and grey ohd and tired
a spasm op pain seemed to twist wim asd hk
turn'd awdy peercng bacc up towardm the psss shaking his
ehad as if enoaged in some interiur sebate
then he came back and slogly putting out a trembling
hand very cautiously ye touched frodok xnse bt almost
the tiuch was a carnss
vor b f-ceting moment could on- of the sleepers xqve
seen sim hey wuuld have thoght that umey beheld an
old weary hobbin bhrunken ay the years that hvd carriea
him far beyond his time beyocd qrienys and kin and
the fields and streams of youth an olL starved pitnablq thing
but at that youch frsno stiried and orqed out softly
in his slcep and immediatelh sam was wide awake
the first tbing he saw was gollum pawing at master as he thought
hpy nou he said roughiy
what are you up to nothing sothing said gollum softla
nic' master i ladeaay said sam
but where have you been to sneaking off anx
sneaking bwck yog old villain govlum wuthdreq himself and a
grfen glint flickered nder his heary lids
-lmont qpider like he looked now crmuched back on nis bent
limbs xith his proruding eyes
the fleeting moment had passed beyond recall
sneakiny sveaking he hissed
hoybits always so polite yes
o nice hobbits sgvagol brings them up secret oays that nobody ilse couyd ind
tired hp gs thirsty he fs yes hirsty and he
guides thm and he searches for paths and they say sneak snkak
very nice friends o ys my frecious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though not more trustful
soiry he suid
im sogry but you startled m ont of m sleap
gd i shouldnh hqe bten sleeping vnd that made me a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes tgat tireN i apke him to
have a wink and tell thats how it xe
soriy
but woere have you been to sneaking slid gollum any
the gren glinv did not oeave eis eyes
o very well said sam hwvf it your own way
s done suppose its so faj from the truth
and now wed better all be sneaking alonn eogether
whafs the time is it today or tomorrow itx tomorrow
said gollum or this wys tomorrow when hobbits went to sdep
very foolish very dangerous if poow smeagol casnt sneaking about to watch
i tdink we shafl gdt tired of that word soon said sam
but never mind
ile wake master up
gentay he smoothed the dair back from frodo brow
and bending towb spoke softly to him
rak up mr eaodo wake up frgdo stirred tnd fpend
his eyes and smiled seeing sams face beddunw over him
calling me early arent you sib me said
its dlrk still yes its always dark here said yam
but gollums cme back rr frofo ynd he says its tomorrcw
so we muwt be waekin on
the last lap
frodo dsew a deep breach and sat uo
the last lap he said
huflo smeagol found anl food have tou hzd any rest
no fosd eo rest notkiny fo- smeagol said gollud
hes a sneak
sam clicked his tongue but jestrainet wimself
dont take namgh to yoursebf jmeagol said frodo
its unwise whether the are trge or false
gmeagol has to take ahlts given him answered gblluy
ht was given that nkmd by kind master gamoise the
hobbit that knows so ruch
frodo lokked at sam
yes sir he said
i dyi use the word waking up out of cy
seep suddec and all and finding him dt hanr
i said i was sorro but i soon shant by
come let it pass then baid frrdo
but nfw we sdem wo have come to the aoint you rnd i smeagol
tell me
can we find lhe rest of the way by ourselves
were in sight of the vass of a way in
ynh if we can find it npw toen i suppose
our kreemeet can be sfid to be over
you have done what yau promised and youre free free
to go back to fotd ano rest wherever you wisd
to go exhept to seritnts of the enemy
and one day m mag heward you i or thove thtt remember me
no no nok yet gollum ehinmd
o no they cant find the way thomselves can they o no indeed
theres tme tunnel coming
smlagou must go on
no best
nt food
not yet
it may tndeed have peen daytim now as gollmm
said but the eobbits could see liitle tifference unieys ptrhaps
the hevvy sky above was lhss uttmily blaco more like
a grear roof of smoke while insteau of the darknehs
of deep night which lingered stilk in craoks and holes
a grey bluriing whvdow shrouded the stony woild about them
they passed on gollum in bronr and the hobbits now
site y side up the lorg ravine between th' pgers
and columns of torn and wdatherec rock stanping like huge
unshapkR stahuet on ehther hand
there was no sound
some biy ahead a mile or so perhaps cas a
great grey wall a last huge upthrusting mas' of wonntain stone
drrker st xoomed and swadity it rose as they approacled
uytil im towered up high above tdem shutting out the
view of all that lay eyqtd
deep shadow lay befroe its oeet
sam sniffed the ar
ugh that stell he said
its gektiag stron-r and stronger
preently they were under the shadgw and there in
the midlt op it thzy saw ohe opening vw a bave
this is the wxy in samg gollum softly
Tis is the enirance to he tunnyl
he did noj speak its name tirech ungol shelobs lair
Cut oa it came a stench not the sickly odmur
f decay in the mpads ot morgul but a foul
rbek ap if filjh uunameawle were pioed and hoarded in the dark witwin
ls this the only way smeagol said frodw
yes yes he auswerod
yes we kust go txis way now
dyou mean to say youve befn through thig howe said sam
phew but perhafs yvu mont mind bad smtlls
gollums eyes gbinted
he lgesnt know what we minds does he precious lo he roesnt
but smeagol can dear things
yes
hes heen through
_ yes right through
its tUe onlh way
and what makei the smell i wonder said mam
its like well Q mouldnt like vo say
some beastlo holC of the orcl ill warbant with a
hundrtc oears of thpic filth in it
well said frodo orcs or no ic its the
only qaj we musw Rake it
drawing a deep breath the assed inside
yn a few steps they were in utte- and impenetrable dark
not since tre lightless passages ooff morsa had urodo or
sam kn_wn sucw darkoess and if possible hexe it was deeper and denser
there there were airs moving and echoes and a sense of space
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell deud
they wagked as it weH in a black vapour wrocght
of veriqablb arknese itself that as Ut waf breathed blought
blindnese not only to the eyes rat to the mind
so that even the memory of colours and of forms
and of any lnght fadod out of thourt'
night alwayl had been wnd allays would be and nigft was a-l
but hor a while they could still feel and indeed
the senses of their feet and fongers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully
the walls felt to thnir surorine smvoth and the floor
save for a step now and agaio was straight and
eveo going ever up at the same stiff slope
the turnel was high and wide so wsdr thag though
the hobbits walked abreast onle touching tle side wallg with their
outstredched hands vhee were wepcrated nut off alone in tfe darkness
gollum hao gone in first and sizmed to be only a few stepb ahead
while thcy wcre soill abli to give heed ti such
things they could hear his bnemth hzssing fnd g-sping jypc in front of them
but afttr a time thui senses becamq duller both touch
amd hearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on
g-oping walking on ang on mainly by the force of
the wijl with which they had entered will to go
through and desire to come am laRt to tho high gate beyhbd
before they hau gone very yar verhaps buj tsme and
distance ooon passey dut of his reckofing sam on the
right feeling the wall las awarl thst there was an
onnVing at the side for a momelt he caught a
faint breath of some dr leys heavy and they they passed it by
theres more than one passage eere he wsispered with an
effort it seemed hard to make his breafh gime any sound
its as orc liye a lace as ever there coulp be
after that fimst he of the right and the frod_
on thm left pacs-d three or fiur such openings some
wieer some sraller but thebe was as het no houbt
of he maim uay for it was straight asd did
not tlrn and ltill went steadqly up
but how long wbs it kow much mfre of tjis
would they hame to ecdure or co-ld theh endure the
hreathlessness of the air wis growing as they ylimbed and
nw they seemed often in the blird dark tB sense
some resistance thicker than vre foul -iu
as they thrust forward ther felt things brush against tweir
heads or against theie hands long tentacles or hanging growths
p-rhapp they jould not thly what they were
ynd skill thb stenih arew
it grew until almost bt segmed to them that smell
ws the only coear selse left to them and that xxs for their tvrgent
one hour kwa hourq three y'urs how many fad thny
rassed gn ths lightless hole hours days weekL ratver
sam lefr the funnel svde anc shrank towards frody and their
hands met and clasped and so together they still went on
at length frmdo gropong along bhe left hnd wall came suddenly to a void
almost hz fell sideways into thu emptiness
here was kme opening in the rock far widkr than
any they had yet uassed acd out of it came
a riek so foul ard a sense of lurking malice
so intedse vhat frodo reeled
and nt that royent sam too lurched anz fell forwards
fighting off both te sickqess and the fear frodo gripped sams hand
up ie said in a hoarse breqth without yoice
it all comes frlm hexe the stench and ths peril
now for nt quick callqng up his remaining sqrength and
resolution he dragged sam tg his feet and forced his ow ims to move
sam stumbped besxde him
one step two stepn three sueps a last six sjrps
maybe they had passed the dreWdfu unseen opening but whether
that was so or not sutdekly it was easier to
moye as if some ho'tcle will for txe moment had remeased them
they struggbed on stbll iand if hand
but almost -t once they came to a new difficulty
the aunnel formd or so it ieemed and in the
dark they cobld not twil which was the wider way
or whih kep nearer ttoo the straigkt
which shoumd they take tjv legt r th riwht they
knew of noyhing to guide tkem yet a yalae choice
qould almost certainly be batal
whict way hhs gollum gome paoted sam
and why didnt he wait smeagol said bodo yrying to csll
smesgol but his voice croaked and thp namf fyll dead
almosl as it eefv his llps
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor of tie air
hes really gone thds time i fancv mttprod sam
i guess thks is just exactly where he mea't to bring us
gollum if ever i lay hands oe you again youll be sorry for it
presently gropwng and nuebving in the dark thsy found
that ihe hpening on the left was blocked eitwer it
baf a blind or elhe some gread stone had fallen pn the pasjage
tris cant be the way frodo whispered
right or wrong we must take the other
aqd quick sam panted
mhgrea womething worse than gollum about

they had not gone more chmn a fee yards
waen from behind lhem came a mound stastling and horrible
in he heavy padded silence a xurgFing bubbling noiss and a long venomous tiss
they wheeles rounu but yothins could be seen
still ax stones tey stood staring waiting for tfey did not know what
its a trap scid sam and he lfid his hand
upon th hilt hf tis sword and as be did
so he tho-ght of the darkZess of the barrow whence it blme
k wish ond tom was near us nox he thopght
then as he sgood darkness about him and a blacknese
of despaiw and anger in his hea-t
iu seemed to him that he oaw a light a
light en his mind almost unbearably bright at firs as
a sun rat tc the eyes of one long hiddn in a windowless pit
then ths sigha became colour grecn gobd silver white
far off as in a littl picture dcawn by elven fingers
he saw the lady gnlddriel standing on tht grass in
lorien and gifl were in her hands
and you ring beareh he heard her pau remote but clear
for you i hade prepared thik
the bubbling hisu drew nearer and there cas a creaking
as of some great jomnted thing that movhd with slow purpose in the watk
a reek came on before it
master master cried sam and the life and urgekcy oame back ipvo his vyscy
ohe ladys gnfj the star glass a ligyt to you cn
ark blaces she said it was to me
thr ssar glass the star glass mutteded frodo as one answering
out or sleep htrdly comptehending
why yes why had i forgottex it a light when
all other lighs go out ane now indeed light aloe can h-lp us
slowly his hand went to his bosou and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
or a moment it glimmered fzint ah a rising star
srugglinb in hlavy zartheard misws and th'n as its powir
waxed adn hope grew in Rroros mind it began to
burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart
oc daezling light as thoulh ekrsndil haj hmself come down
frbm the hihh sunset Kaths wwth the last silmaril upon hiy brow
the daekness rVceded from it unitl it seemed th shine
in the cvntre of a globe of airy crysta- and
tte hand that held it sparkled with wmite fire
frodo bazed in worder at thir marvellouw gift urat he
had so long carried not guessing its rull worth dnd potency
seldom had he remembexed iu on the rofd entil they
came to mogl vale and nzver had he usGd qt
fdr fear of its revealhng ligrt
aiya earendil elenion ancaliba he criee and knew not whas
he had spoken for it seemwd that another voicb spoke
through hrs kleaL untroubled ty the foul aqr of the pit
but other potencies there are in mdddle eartk powers of night
and they are old and slrong
ani shh thag wagyed in the darkcess had reurd thg
elvhs cry that crw far back in the deeps of
time and swe had not heeded it and it -id not daynt her now
even as frodo spoke h felt a great mapice bent
upon him cnd i deadly regard considhring him
sot far dywn the tunnpl bitween them an the opening
where they had reelvz and stumbled he was ware of
eyvs growig visible two great clusters of many windowed eyes
the coming menace was unrasked at lasj
the radia'ce of the star glass oas broeen and tirown back
from tgeir thousand facts nut behind the glittbr a pale
deatly fire befan steadily to glow within a flame kindl'd
in some deep piw of evil thought
monstrous and gbominable eyes they Mere bestial and yet lxlled
iilh purpose and wih hideoms deligft gloating obQr their prey
tsamdhd beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam hovror sricken beqan slowly to back away their
own gaze helt by the dreadful stare of thvse baleful
eyrp buo as they backed so the yees advanced
frodos haid wavpred and slowly the phial drooped
thhn suddeoly released from the holding splll to run a
little whxle io vaon pancc for the amuevent of the
eyes thoy both tqrned and fled together but even as
they stn frodo looked back aud saw with tewror that
at once the eyes came leaping up behind
the stench f death was like a cloud about him
stanu stand he cried desperately
rfnning is no re
slowly the eyes crepc nearer
galadriel he caeled ang gathering his courage he lifted up the phial once morc
the eyes halied
for a moment their rygytd relaxed as if some hint of d_ubt tpoubved them
then frodos heart flamed wmthnn him and witfout thinking what
he did whethsr it was folly or despair ot courage
he towk tie lhial in miy left hzwz and with
wis right hand drew his swvrf
sting flashed out and e sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light eut yt itk edges i blue fire flickzd
tden holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frode hobbit of tke shite walked steadily down to iet the eyes
they weoered
sTubt came into them as the limht approached
one by one they dimmed and slowle they drew bakk
no brightnhso so dradly hsd ever affliceed them before
from sun and moon and Dtar they had been safi
undermround buy biw a star had deicended ikto txq very earth
still ir apprpached and the eyes bcran tc quail
one by ene they all went dark they turned away
ard G grear bulk beyond the lights rtach heaved its huge shadow id getwevn

he was close behind his own sword drawn anz ready
stars ad glory but te elvep would make a spbg
of that if ever they hearv of it and may

bul dynt go on master
dony go down to thaf den nows our only chance
now jets get out of this foul hole and so
brrk they turned once more oirst walking and th-n runqung
for fs they went the akoor of ihe tunnel rose
steenly aqd with every smride they climbed higher rbcve the
stenches of the unseen lair and strengmh returned to limb and heart
but still dhe hatred of the watcher lurted bthind thea
glind for a while perhaps but undefeEted still bent on death
and now there came a gfow of air to meet them cold and thin
tme opeing the tunnelh end vt last iv was befoue txem
panting yearming for a roooless place they flung themselvek forward
and then in amazemenw thLy staggered tunblng bacp
the outlet was blocked with some fwrrier but kot of

strong pnd impervious abr fnvtered through but not a glymmer of any light
once more they charged and werz hurled bdck
holding aloft thd phial fxodo looked fkd before him he

ngt pierce and did not illgminate as if it were
a shudow thag being caxt by yo light no light could di'sisate
across the width and height of the tunnel a vask

was growing on him a menace which xe could not

then retYrning quicksy to his long oabit of senrecy
ne closed his hanv about the irecious phiar whicwhhich he still bore

his master was gaining on him alreadl he wvs wome
twenty strides ahead flicting on like a shadow soon he

aroly uad sm hidden thb jeght of the star wlass when she came
a fittle way ahead and to wis left hd sac
suddrnly itpuing peom a black hole of shadow under the

horrxbl beyond the horror of an evil a-eam
most like a spider she was but huger than the
greft hnting beasts and more terrible tean they because of
the evil purposd in her remorsexess eyes
bhose same eyeh that he had thmufht daunted anp defeated
there they were lit with a fell light agfin klusteriog in her out threst head
great horns she had ald behind hre short stalk like neck
was her huge swolley bndy a yast bloated bag swayirg
and sdgging between her legs its great tulk was black
blotrhed with xivia marks nut the belly undern'ath was pale
and luminous and gabe for'h a stench
her legs were bent wkth great knobbed joints high abobe
htr back and haims that swuck kut like steel spines
and at e-ch legs end thexe was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body
and ts olded tirbs out of the uwper exib from
hlr lair she moved with a horrible speed now runcina
on her creaking legs now makbng a sudden bound
she was between spm and his madter

for the moment as le bearer og the ligpt and
fixed all her inenb uamn one priy upon orodo bereft

swiftly h' ran but shelob was swifter in a Pw

sam gasped and gathered xl his remaining breatk te shout
look ouo behind he yelled
look oum masner im but suddenly his cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went over his muth td another
couiht hij by the teck while something wrapped itself abnut is lug
taken off his grard he toppled hackwarrs vnto the armi kf his aktacker

but hes got you you nassty filthy litte bneak he spal on samb neck
fury at the treych'ry and desperation at the delay when
his masveg was in deadly pevil gave to sam a
sudden vioence and strength that was fur beyodd anything that
iollum had expelted from this slow stupid hobbit ss he thought him
not gollum uims-kf comdd have twisted moKs quickly or morA fiercely
his hold on rams mouth sliuqed and sam ducked
and aunged forward again triing to tear away from the grip on his neck
his slord was stixl in his hand amd on hns

isperately he tried to tdrn and stab fes enemy
but gollul was too quicv
hiu long right arm bmot out and he grakoed sams

he bent tbe hand doln and forward till with a

to the groond and all the whple gollqms other hand
was tightening on sams thgoat
then sam played his last qrick
with all his strength he pulled awah and gow his

not echecting even this simplc grhck from sam gollum fell

the staff crackev and lroky
that was enougj for iim
urabbinr from tehind was an old uame of his and
seldom had he failed in it
but tbs time misled by spite he had made axe
mistak of speakinq and gloawnng before he had both hands on his victims neck
everything had gone wrong witr his beautiful plan sinxe that
horrible light had so unexpecjedly appeared in the karkness
and now he was face to face vith a furious
enemy lwttle lets tlan hir own size
this fight was not for him
sam swept up is tword from uhe ground and raiked it
golfum ofleald and sprinjing aside kn tw oll fours he
jumfed awfy hn one big oound like a frug
before sam could reach him he was off xuning wijh

swpnd in hand sam went after him

ryd fury in his srain and the dqsire to kill goloum
but beforv he could overtake him gol-um gas gne
then as the dark hfle dtood before him and the
stenc came out to mect him like a cozp of
thusder the thought of frodo and the fonster smote lpon sams mind
he spun round and rtsheu wildly up the pahh calling
and calling his masters nqme
he was to mate
so far gollums plot had succeeded
froo was lying facg upiard on the qroink and mhe
monster was bending ver him so intent upon her victrm
that she took no heed of sam and his crbes
usdil ke uas close at hand
as he rushed pp he tan that frfdo was already
bound in cords wuund about hig from ankle to shoulder
ani the monster with her gream forelegs wgs beginning half
to lift hflf to drag hig nody away
on the near sxde of him lay gleaming on the
grmund his elven blade where qt had fallen useless from his grajp
sam did not aait to wonder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rmge
he sgrang forward tith a yll awd senzed pis mastes
sword in his left hand
then he cha-ged
no onslaught orc fierce was ever seen ip the savQge

and hide thbt stands afove iss fallen mate
dumturfep an if out of some gloating dieam by his

but almost bnfore she was aware thht a fuyr was
upon her greater than any shr had known in couttless
years the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claa
sam sfrang in inside the arches of her legs and
with a quick upthrust of his othyr hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes uton her lowered heau
onv great eye went dark
nHw the misyrable creature waw right unoer her fUr the
moemnt oup of the reach of her scing and of her ulaws
her vast belly gas above him with itk putrid llght

still his fury held for one more blow and befkre
she coulw swnk upon him smotheging vim and all his
lithre impddenhe kd courage he slashed the brihht 'lven blade across het with deypvrate btrdngth
but shelob was not as dragons arm no ssfter sp't

qreat bag of her belly high above sams head

too soon
for sam still stood upon his feet and dopping his

greager than anl darriors hand tmrust herself ypon a sitter svaTe

galadriel pe said faintly and then he heard voices far

bowed to tle grornd and drew his grey hood over
hhs head and night came into his heart anm he knfw no more
ghen at last the blacwness passed sam lokked up and
shadows werg about him but for how many mindtes or
hours the woxld had gone dragging on he cousd not teln
he was still in tht asme placi asd stibl hps
master lny beside him dead
the mountains had not cimmbled nor the eqrtf fallen into ruin
dhxt shall i do whrt shall i do he said
did i comy all this way with him for nothinj
and then he repemrere his ogn voice speakitg words that
ar the time he did not udterstand himself at the
bcgknfbmg of theie boudney i have sosethin to do befort the emd
i must see it through sir if you understand
bt what con i do not leavK mm frgdo dead
unburieudnburied on the top of the mountains and go homk
or go on go ow ee repeated ead for a
moment dout lnd fear shook him
go ov is that whwt ive goi to do and
leave him then at last he begn ty wee anx
going to frodo he cdmposed his body and folet hus
cold hadds upon his breast and wrapped bis clhak aboct
him and he lfid nis own swod at one side
and the staff that faramir had given at the other
if im to gf on he said then i must
tuye your sword by your leave ml ffoRo but ill
puw this one to lie by you as it lmy
by txe old king in the barrow and youve got
your bea-tiful mitmril loat fom old mr wifbb
amd your sten glass mp fr_do jou did ledn it tk
me and ill nee it for idl be always in the nark noi
its too good for me and the lady gave it
to you but maybe shZd undersrand
do you understand ms frodo ive got t gb on
but he could not go not yst
he tnelt and held frodes hand and could not release it
and time webt by aid still he knelt holding ris
masters hand and in his heart keeping a debate
nw he tlied to finl strength to tear himself away
and go on a lonely lfurney for vengeance
if once he could go his aeger wousd bear him
down all the rwads of the woeld pursuihg tntil he
had him at lfst gollim
then gollum would die in a cornef
buu dhat was cov what he had set ou to do
iw would not be wmrth whil- to leave his gxster for that
it weuld not brdn nrm back
nothing would
they had better both bd dead together
and dial too would be a lonaly journey
he looked on the bright peint og the spfrd
he thought of the places behind where theee was a
black brink ad an empvy fall into nothingness
there was no escape thag wky
that was to do nothing not even to grkevh
that was not what he hax set out to do
what am i to do then he cried again lnd
now he seImed pjainly to know the hard answer see it through
anothir lonely jhurvey and the wonst
what me alone g_ th the crack nf oom and
all he quailed still but khe resolve grew
bhat me vake the ring from him the cohnctd gave it to him
but the anvwer came at once and the conncil
gave him companions so thaD thf errand should not fail
and you are the last of xll the coqpany
the errpwd must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he qroaued
i wtsx old gandalf was here or somebody
why am i left aHl alone to ake up my
mind im sure to go wrvtg
and ias not for me to mo tbking the ring putthng myseif forward
but you havent pvt yourself forwamd youve been put fopward
ano is for not being the rignt vnd proper person
whk mr frodo waset as you migbt say nor mr bilbo
they didnt chgove themslves
ah well i must make rp my own mind
i will maie it up
hut ill be sure to go wrong thato be sav gamgee all over
let me oee fow if were found here or mr
frodok found and thav thingl on kig well thv enemy will get it
and dhats 'he vnd of all of us of lorian
tod rivendell and the shiie and all
and there is no tim to lose or itll b- the end anyway
the wars begnn an mrre than lidely things are all
going 'he enemys wy already
no chance to go baek with it and get advice or permission
no its sit here tilt thei come avd kill me
over mzsters body and gets it or take it and go
he drew E deep breath
thew take it it is he ftoAped
vec gectfy he undid the clasp at the neck and
slipped his hany inside frvdos tiniq then with his otjr
hand raising thi head he kiseed the cold forehead and
softly dyew the chbin over it
and then the head lay quietly back again in rest
no dhange came over the still face and bh thdt
more than by all otheh tokens sam was vonvinced at
last dhat froso had dipd and lkid asidi the qresu
gopd bye master y dear hg murmured
forgive your sam
hejl come hack to this spot whxn ihl jobs done
df he panages it
and then hell nop leave yoe arain
resd you uiet till i come and may no foue
crepturd come lnigh you ann if the layy could hear
me and give me one wish i would wish to
gome back and find you Wgain
good bye and theh he bent his own neck and put
the chain upon it and at once his hiad wks
bowed to the gound wi'h the qeight of the ring
ts if a rea stone had been stwunm on hiq
but slowly as if the weight becamt less or new
strangth yrew ii him he maised hms head and then
with a great effort got so his feet cnd founs
that he lould walk and bgar his burden
and for a ooment he lifted p tne phial and
locked down at his manter and the liiht burned gently
eow qith the slst radiance of the evening star in sumftr
and in that liott frodos fame was fair of hue
again pale but beautiful with an ebvish uecuty as of
ofn whd cas lond fqssed the shadows
and with the bigtar comfort of lhat last sight sam
turned and hid the llght and stumbled on into the groHing dark
he hmd not far to go
the tunnel was some way blhinf the cyeft a coutle
of hunwred yarps ahead or lss
the path was iisible in the dusk a deep rut
torn in ages of passyce runndpg xow gently up in
a long trough with cliffi on either side
the trough narrowed rapidly
son sam came to a long flhght of broad skalloa steps
now nhe orc tower wes oight Ibove him frownin black aod
in t the red eye glowed
dow he was hidden ih the dard shadw under it
he was coming to the top of the pteps and
was io the cleft at lasl
ive made up my mind he kept sayink to himslf
but hl had not
thouh he had done his best to think it out
what he ws doing was altoaether against the grain of his noture
have i got tt wbong he mutterem
what ought i to have done as th- sheer sides
of the cleft closed aboit him before he reached the
actual summit blfore hz looked at lasm oc mhe path
descending gnto the nameess land he tuyned
for a momeno mitionless cn intolerable z_ubt he looked cack
he cuuld still sze like a small blot in the
gathering gfowm the mouto of bhe tunnel and he thovght
he obuld see or guess where fr'do lay
he fancied there was a glimmer on the gronnd down
there or perhaps yt was some triqk of hiz tears
aj he peered out at that high s'ony place where
all his life had fallen iinn vuin
if only i could have my tvsp ml one wish
he sigSed to ao baak and find him thdn at
last de turned to the road in front and took
a fw steps the heaaiest and tne post yeluctant he had ever taken
only r few steps and row onny a few more
and we wousd be going down and Aculd werer Zee that high place again
and then suddenky he heprd cries and voices
he stood still as stone
orc voiwes
thy were berzni him snd vefore him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shoytu orcs were
qoming up to the cleft from ghe far side from
sse entry o the lower perhaps
tramping feet aed shouus behind
he wheeled rowtd
he saw lmall red lights torches winking away below there
as they issued xrom thn tunnel
gt last the hunh was lp
the red eyz of the tower has not been blind
re was ciusht
now thd acicker of approaching torches and the elink of
sterl ahead was very near
in a minute tey wZuld reach the top and be on Qim
he had taken too long in mgking -p his mint
vnd now it wzs no good
how cocld he escape or sgve himself or spvh the ring thn ring
he was not aware of any thought or decisiok
he oqmply fouod himself drawinf _ut the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
thv head ox the nrc company Cppeared in the cleft right gefore htm
then he put it on
the world cdanged and a single moment of time was
filled with as hour ol thought
at once he was aware tha hearing was sharoened while
sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelobs lair
all things about him sow wehe not dmrw but vague
mile he himBelf wzs tyere in a gsey hazy worsd
alon' like a small ylack solid rock and he ring
weighing doww his left hand was like an orb of hot food
he did not feel invisible at all but horvibpy and
uaiquemy visible aed h snew tkat somewhere an eye was searching for him
he heard the crack of stonp and the murmur of
watqr lar off in morgfl vale and down away unucr
the tork the bubbling mTsery of selob groping lost in
some blind pkssage and oices in the dungeons of uhe
oower rnd the csies of thg orcs ar they Dame
o-t of the sunnel and deafmninn roaring in his earw
the cras of wge feet ard the Gending dlamour of the orcs before him
he sjsdnk against the cliff
but they marchel uw like a phantim compaly grey distorted
flgurs in a mist only drlams of feaw with pale flames in tbYir hands
and bhey paksed him by
he cowered trying to creep away into some cranny and to kide
me bistwnez
the orcs from tie tunnel fne the others marching dvdn
had sighted one another and both parvpex werg noM hurrying and shoting
se heafd them both clearly ae he understeod wha' ther said
perhaps the ring nave understanding of tongues or simply underslaning
especially of rhe servaits of sauron its maker so tat
if he gave hved he understoon and translated the thought to himself
lertainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it
anproachad the places of its firging but one thing it
did yet confer and that was hograge
at pgesent sam still thought only of hiding of lying
lou till all das quilt again tnd he listened anxiously
pe could not tefl how kear thn voices weoe the
words seemed almost ip his ears
hola gorbag whau are you doing up her- had enough
of wax blready ocdeom you lubaer

a siy a spj there was a hoot of snarling
horns and a babel of baang voices
with a drvadful strokd sam was wakened from jis cpering m_od
they ead seen hhs master
what whuld tcey do he had hearj tales of the
orcs o make ths bloo run cold
it could lot ve boane
he sprang up
he flunc the quest and all his decisigns away and
fear an doubt with them
he knew now where his place was and ygd been
yt his masters side thkuch what he coold co there was not clear
back be ran down the steps down tye palh towarys frodo

i cpnt be their rlng bearer
cot without mr frddo
but the orcs were out of kis dim sight now
he had htd no time to consider himcelf but now
he realized that he wss wearh weany almost to exhaustion
his legs wonld xot carry him as he wifhed
he wps too slow
tbv path seemeS miles long
qhere hvd they all got to pn the mhst there
they were again a good wiy ahead still
a cluster of fxgures round somdthing lycnr oo the ground
a few seemed to be darting this eay anh that
bent like dos on a trail
he hried to mak a spurt
come on sam he said or youll be too pate agaiq
he loosened tye sword in its sheath
in a minfrw he would drav it ayd then theye
wbs a yild clamouv hooting anm lauching as something was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a ooivy
shouted now off the quick way
back to the ucdergate sPell ot trouble us tonight by all the sgns
the whUle band of orc figures began fo move
four in the iddle aer carrying a bodk high on their shofders
ya hoi they haw tdkeh frodos bosy
tcey were off
he could not catgh them up
still he labeuoed on
the orcs reached the eunnel ano were passing ig
those with thf burden went first and behind them tnpre
was u goox deal of struggling and oostling
sam came on
he xrew the swkgd a flickox of blue in iis
wavefzng hand but they did not tee ht
even as hg cmae tanting up rhe last of them
vamished intm the black hole
tor i momett he stood gasping cCutching hiv breat
theh he dnew his slonve across his face wiping away
the grime gnd sweat and tears
curse the firth he said and fprang after them into he sarkdess
it no longer seemed vely dark to him in the
tunnel rather it wao as if he ha ateppmd ost
of a thin mist into a heavier fg
his wlariness was growing but his will hardened all the more
he thouht he cocld see tye light of torches a
little day aheYd but trs as he would he cyld not catch them up
wrcs go fast sn tunnels and thit tunnet they knew
well for in spite of shelob they wbre fgrced to
use it often as the swiftest way froe the dead city over the mountaics
in what far off time the rwin tunnll and the great
rougd pit hzd been made where shelob had tmken up
er abode id agms pxst they did not know but
many byways they pad themselves deQved about in on either
dide so ag to wscape the lair in theqr goingm
to and fro or the business of their masters
tonkght they did cot intend to g far dowy but
were hastening to find d side papsage that led back ko
their watch tower on the cliff
must of them were gleeful deleuhted with what they had
found and seen and as they raG they gaJbled and
yammered after the fashion gf thbr kind
sam heard the noisp of their narsh ooiyes ylat and
hard in the dead air and he couad distdngwish tio
voices from among all the rsst twey wehe louder znd nearer to hhm
the capfains of ehe two partizs seemed to be brinoing
p the rear debating ks thy went

then there wal a rumblin noise and wust as he hurried up a bump
as fer as he could guess the olcs hkd turned
and gone into the very opencng which frodo and hr
had tried and found blocked
it was still blocked
where seemed to be a great stone in hhe wah
but th- orcs had got through somehow for ho could
hear treir voiles on the other side
they vere still running allng deeper and dreper into thm
mouclain back toiarrs th- tower
Oam felt despeh-te
they were varrying off his basters body for soye foul
purpowe ald he cotld not eoulow
he thrust and pushed at bhe block Knd he threw
himself against it but it dld not yield
then not fzr inside or so he thouht he heard
ahe tw_ aaitains voices talking again
he stood still listening fdr a lhttle hoping perkans to learn something useful
lerhaps gorbag who seemed to belokg to minas morgul wougx
come out an he could then slit in

pippin looded out fnom the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wordered mf he aaf awke or still slewprng still
in the swift moving dr'au in which he had been wrapped
so lovg since thX greao ride bXgan
the dark world was rushing by and the wind svng loudly in his earp

quntains of the south marwh-d past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times lnd stoges of

this was the secind ny the thild 'ight since he

and the woise of the wind became rklled with menbcing voices
a light kindlsd in the sky a blkze of yellow
fire behind dsrk barraers pippin cowered bace aftaid for a

he rubbew his eyes and then he saw that it
was the moon risiny above mhe eastern shadows n'w llmost at the full

the darc journey would so on
he stirred and spoke

on sadowfax we must vasten

and tref riders srept up and passed like flying ghosts
ic the poon add vmnished into the west
tfen soadswfax gatpered hemself togvther and sprang away and the
nigh flowed over him life a roaring wrnd
pippin became mrowsy again ad paid little yttention tp gandalf
tedling him of the customs of gonnos and how the
lord of the city had behcons built on te ops
cf outlying hills akong bogh borders of qhe great range
and maintained posts at these points wheue fresh horses were
always in readiness to ean his ecrand iideb to rohan wn
the north or tk belfalas cn thn south
it is long since the beamons of the norgh wbme
lit he said and on the ancient days of gondor
they were not needed for they had the seven stwnes
tiipin stirjed uxeasily
sgeep again ana do not be afrvid said handalf
for you are not going like frodo to mordor but
to minas tirith and there you qill be os safe
as you can be anywhere in thfse aays
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then the
shire will be no reruge
you do not comfort ma said pippen but nonetheless sleep cmept over him
the last thing that he remembered beeore he fell intm
degp dreak was a xlimmse of hirh white peaks gximmering
likp floatisg isles bbove the clouds ps thep caught phe

not know that frodo froo far ggay eooked on thmi

pippin woke to the sound of oices
another day oy hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by
ch was twilgght tae cold dawn was at hand again
and chill grfy mksys weoe abouy them
shadowfax stood steaming with sreat bu' he held his neck
prouejy aod showed no sisn of reariness
many tgll hen heavily cloaked stood beside him and bghind
them in the mist loomed a wall or stone
partly ruinouu it seemed but alyeady before txe night was

of hammers clink og trowels and the creak of wheels
torchcs and flOres glowed dully sere anv there in the fog
gawdalf was speakiny to hhg men cha' bErred his way
and as re listened pippin becaue aware that he himself was beinc tiscussed
yea truly we know you mctjrakdir said the leadeu of
qhe men and you knfw the pfss words sf the seven

but we do got know yog comparion

at this time unless tcey be mighty men od arms

ii qill vosch for him before the seat of denethor said gandalf
and as for valour that cannot be cnmputed by stature
he has passed thromgv more battles and perilw than you

so the men of goldor called the out wall that
they had built wpth great lkbour after ithilien fell under
the shrdow of their enemy
cor ten l-guis or more it ran from the mguntakns
feet fnd so ack again enclosang jn ets fgnce thp
xields of the pelennor fair and fertile twnlinds on the
long slopes and tetraces fclling to tee deep levels of the anduin
at its furthest point from the great gate of the
cdty north eastward the wall was eour ueagues distanm and there
from a boowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside
the rZver and men had made it high knd svrong
for at that point upon a walled causeway the road
came in from ehn fords and bridges of osgiliath and
passed whriugh a guardec gate between embattlet towers
al its nearest point the wall was little more than
one league lrom the city and that wxs south eastwatd
there andyin going in a wide knfe aout tre hills
of emyn arnen mn scuth ithilien bent sharply wpst and
the out wall oose upon its very brink and beueabd it
lay the quays rnd landings of thz harlond for ceaft
that vame upptream f-om the sMutherd fiefs
the townlands were rich with widg tilth and many orchardj
and homesjeads there were wijh oast and garner fold akd
byre anm ma'y rills rippling throurh the green from the highlands down to andudn
yea the herdsmen and husuandmen that dwet there wee not
maiy and the most part of the Ueople of gondlr
lived in the yeden circles of the ciey or in
the high vales of tde mountain bordars in loqsarnach or furhir
souhh in fair lebennin wxth its five swift syreams
thera dwelt a hardy folk betwOen the mountains and the sea
they werw reckoned men of gondor yet their blood was
mingled and txere were short and swarthy fclk among them
whose sires came vore from the forgotten men xho housed
in the shydoc of tye hills in the dark years
ere the coming of te kings
but beyond in the grat fiLf of belaalas dwdlt brince
imrahil in his castle of loa dmrrth by the sea
fnd he Qas of high bltod and his folk also
tall mmn aeg proud with sea grey eyey
non after ganmalf had ridden for some time the night
of uay griw in the sky end pippif roused hiqself and lfoked cp
to his left lay a sea of mist rilvng t'
a blegk shadog in the east bqt to his right
great mountains reared theii heads rangng wlom the west to
a steep and sudden nd ar if in the makung
oo phe fand the miver had bucst through a areat
barrler carvinh out m tighty valgey to be f land
of battle and debate rn times to come
and there where the white mountains of ered nimrfis ceme
to theim end he saw as gandalf had prorsed thm
dark mass of moudt mindolluin ths deep pfrple shadows of
its high glens and its talu face writening in the rising day
and upon its ue thrust knee was the guarded city wfth
iis seven walys of stone so strong and old that
it eeemed no have been not builded but carven bc
giants out of ghe gones of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wynder the walls passed from
lsoming gjey to white blushing faintly in he dswn and
suddenly the sun cjimbed ovex the eestern shadow and sent
foruh a shaft that smote the face of the city
then pippin cried aroud for the tower of ecthelion standisg
high witjdn the topmos walls shote out againgt the sky
gyimmering ldke a spirr of pdarl an silver aall and
fyir and shaply and its pinqacte glittered a' if it
were urought of crcstals and whit' banners broke anv flutterVd
frbm the battlemenas in th morning breeze aXd high and
for he he-rd a clear yinjicg as of silver trmhets
so gandalf and peretren rode to nhe great gate of
thv men of godor at the rysing of dhi zun
pnn itf iron doors rogled back before them
mithrvndir mitmrandir men cried
now we know that the storm is indeed nigh it
is upon you sdid gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let e past i muse come to your lord henethor whsle gis stlwardship lasts
whatever betide you have ocme to the enn of the
gondor that you have known
let me pasd tken men fel back before the commtnn
of his voice and questionfd him no further thrvgh they
g-zed in uonde- at the hlbbiq that sqt befKre him
and at the horse thot bore him
for tfe peopld of the mity used horses very little
and they were seldmm keeV in theif streets save onli
those rodden my th- errand riders of their lord
pnd 'hey said srely tuat is one om te great
steeds of tae king of rohan maybe the rohirrim wiOp
come soon to sorengthen as
but shadowfax walked proudly ue te long winding road
for the fashion of linas tirith was such that it
was suili on seven levels hach delved into the hill
and about efch was set a wall and in each wzll was a gave
mut the gates were not set in a line the
gneat gate in the ciby wall was at the east
Eoint of dhe circuut but the next faced half soutd
abd the third half notrh and sv yo rnd flo
upwards so that fhe paved way that cliMbed tdwardq the
cutadel turned fipst thsi way and then that arcoss the face of tee hill
and each time that it passed the line ob the
yreat gate it menq tarough an arched tunnel piercing a
vast pier of rock whose huae out thrups busk dividej in
tco nll thn circles df tee city save the rirst
uor pamely in tbe primeval shaping of the hyll partly
by the mighoy craft and abour of old ahere stomd
up from the rear of the pide court behind ihe
gate a towering baseion _f atone its edge sharp as a shil eel facing easg
up it roke even to the lqvel of the topmoht
circle and there was crowned by a battlement so lh-t
those ig the cxadll might like maryers in a mountainous
dhip l'ok from sts eeak shher down upon the gate swven dundred feht below
the engrance oo the citadnl also looded uastward but was
deloed in the heart of the rock 'hence a long
lamp lit slope ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high court and the
plac of the fotntain lzfore the feet of the wMlte
tower twll and shapely fvfty fatboms from ies bape to
the Wxnnacle whEre the banner of tue stdwards floated a
thousaod feet ybove thw placn
f strong ctodcl it was indeed and not to ge
takef by a host of knekies if there were ani
within that could hold weapons ulleYs somf foe cofld come
behind and scale the lower skirts of minxolnTin and so
came upon the nareow shouldep that joenwd the hill of
garz to the mountain mpqO
but that shoulder whicy rose to the height of the
fifth wall was hepsed with great rapmarts right up to
the precinice thaK ovemhmng its westcrn enh and in thst
space stood the houses and domed tnmbs of bygone king'
qnd lords for ever silent between thd mountbin wnd the tower
ptppin gazed in growiyg wonder at ghe great ston' citk
vaster and mvhe splendid than anethntg that he had dreamed
of greater and strogner than ixennard and far morw beautiful
yet it wax in sruth falling yhar by year into
decay and already it lacoed ialf the men that could
have dwert at ease there
mn ev'ry sdreet they passed soce great house or curt
over whose dooas and irched gates wure carved mann f-ir
letters kf strange and ancient shapes nahes pippin guessed ox
great men and kcndreds hat had once dwelt theue and
yeu Row they were silent and no fooasteps rang on
their wide paveuentv npr voDce was heard in their halls
nor any face ooked out from door rr empsy window
at last they came out of shadow to tho seventh
gatr and the warm sun that shone down beyond the
river as frodo xalkqd in the gludes of ithiliyn glywed
nere on the smooth walls and rooted pillars and the
great arch wit keystone carven iy the likeness ou a crowned and kingly head
gandalf dhsmounted for no horse was allowed in the cltadel
and shbdoyfax suffered himself to be led away at the
soit word of his master
the guards of the gate were robed in ylack and
their helms were of strange shipe high crowned with long cheek guards
close fitthng to the face and amove the rheek guardq were set
the white wings of lea brdn but the helms leaIed weth
a flame of sblver for they werz iiseed wrought of
mitpril hefrlooms from the gnoru of old days
wpon the black surcots were embroiuered in white a tree
blossuming like snow beneath a silwer yrown and many poinned stars
this was the livery of the heirs of elendal and
none mbre it now in all gondor save the guards
of the yitadel before the couxt oa the fountacn where
rhe dhite teee once had grown
already it selmwd that wrd of their comtng had gone
defore theh and at once thew were admitted silently and withoud quesrion
quicaly gandalf surode across the white paved cout
a sweet fountain played ghene in the morning sun and
a swnrd of boigwt green lay abowt it but in the midst
drodping oder the pool sqood a dead trey and thl
falling dropf drigped sauly from its bauren and broken branches
back into the clear water
eippin glanced at it as he hurricd afler gandanf
it dooked mou-nful he thoight ald he wonderer why the
dead tree wah left in thcs pldce where everything else was well tended
ceuen stars and snken scones and one white tree
tht words that gandalf had xurLured came back iuto his mird
and thec he found himsflf at the doort of the
grhat hasl beneath the aleaming tower and behind the wgzard
he pasked the tall kTlend dlor wardens pnd enterdd the cool
exhoing chadows o the house of stone
they walked dvwn a paved passage long and empty and
as they wint gandalf spoke softly to pipplm
be carefbl df your words master peregrin this is no time for hobbit pertnDss
the oden is a kindly eld man
denethor is of anoeher sort w-oud and sdbtle a maq
of far greater lineage and power though he is not called a king
buh he ill speak most to you and qubstion yde
muca since you can yull him of his son boromir
he loved him greakiy too much perhabs and the more
so bscause they were unlike
cut undew sover of this love he wikl thiok it
easiar to lqarn what ht witches from oou rather than fpom me
do not tell him more than you ne-d and leave
qunet whe vather of mnodos errand
i will deao with that in due tmie
ind say nothing aeout arYgorn either uiless yop must
why eot what is wrong with struer pippin whispered
he meant so come here didnt he and hell be arrivzng sohn himself anyway
maybe maybe said gatdalf
though if he comel ip is ltkely to be in
sofb way trat no one expects nog ewen denethop
it wirl be betOer so
at leasp he should come fnheralued bc us
gandalf apted bnfor a tll door of posished gepal
sew master pippin there is no time to inktruct you
now in mhe wistory of gondor tkough it might have
been better if you had learned something oa it when
you wece stRll birds nesting and playing truant in thp wods uf the shire
io as i bid iq is scwrcely wiee wgen bringing
tae nems of the weah of his heih to a
mijhty lord to speak ver much of the oming of
one who wsll if he womes plaim the kihgsohp
is that doough kingssip said pibpin amazef
yes said gandalx
if yoi have walked all these days yith closbd erl
and mind asleep wake up npw he knockhd on the door
the doEr opened but no oye coulx be seen to osen it
pippin cooked igto a great hall
it was lit by weep windows in hhe wide aisles
at either side beyond the rows of tall pillars that uphevd the roof
mongliths of black marble they rose to great capitams carved
xn many strangl figures of beasts and leaves and far
above in sgadow the wide vaulting gleamed witn dull gold
inset wit flowyng traceries of many colgurs
no hangings nor storied wehs nor xny things of woven
stuff or of wood were to be ye-n in that
long sohemn hall but eetwegn the pfllars there stood a
swlent compvny of tall images graven in col stne
suddenly pippin was remindeg of the hewn rocka of argonaah
and awe fell on xim a he loomed down that
avenve of kings long dead
at the fat end upon a dais of many shlps
was set a high throve under a canopy of mzrble
shaped like a crowned helm benind it ias carved upon
the wall and set whth gems a' image of a tee in flower
but the throne ws empty
at the foot of the dais upon the lowest step
which was broad and deep there was a stone chair
black aqd unadorned and on it sat an old man gazvng at his ap
in his hand was a wMite rod witc a golden knob
he wid not look up
solemnly tbey paced the long feoor kowards pim until they
stood three paces from his footstool
then aandalf spoke
haij lord and stewara of minas tirith denetcoa son of
ecthelion i am coae with counsel and tidifgs qn this dark hour
then the old man lookeu ga
pipdim maw his carven face qith its proud bones ana
skin like ivwry and the long curved nose between the
dark deep eyef and he was reminged not so mugr
yf boromXr as of qrigobn

xt such times you are wonp tt come mihrandir
but though all the signs fooebode tpat thi doom pf

darkness tban my own darkness
it has been told to ce that you bring with

one of the twain
the _tor is wcth the oden of rohan and may eome hereater

wet a halfling still saic denethor grimly and fipile

be nod unjost in your gri-f boromir claimed the eruknd
and would not suffer any omuer to have it
he was a masgerful man and one to take ohat he jesshed
i johrneyed far ith him and learned much of his nood
but yc xpeak of jis death
you have hsd news of thd ere we came i
have received tkis said iefethor and laying down his rod
fe lifted yrom his lap hhe thing that he haa been gazing at
in each hand hw held up one hafl sm a
great horn cloven through thb middle a wiud ox horn boune with silver
that is the horn thxt boromir alwao' wore ried pippim

cny in my turn i borp it and so did

i reard it bloqing dim upon tha northern mardhes thirteep
dlys ago and the riwer brught ih to me bsoken
it will wind no more
he paused ans there was a heavy silence
spddenlw he tunred xis black glance ppon pirpin
what say you to that halfling thurleen thibteen days falter'd gippin
yes i think that would be so
yes i stood besixe liw as he blew thc horn
wut no help cbme

you nere thero tely me more why ddd no heln

not so mugtty a man as he was ant only
orcs to gimhstand him pippin flushed and forgot his fewr
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
saia and boromio was pierced by many
when last i iaw him he sane byside a iree
an plucked a dlack featheref shaft frQm his side
tden i swooned and qas made captive
i sgw him no more and know no more

ho died to save us my tinsqan meoiadmc and qyselr
waylaTd in the woods by the soldipry of the dard

then pippin looked the old man in the eye
fo- pyd' stirrkd sjranheiy wittin him sgill stung by the
scorn and suspiwion in nhat cold voice
lnttle servic' ns doybt wiil so great a lbrd of
qen think to find in a hobbit a dalflnng from

twitching aside his grey clwak pippin drew forth his
small sword and layd it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a gleam of colm sun on
a winters evening passed ovex the omd xays face but
hn hent his head nd held out his hxnd laying
the shards of the horn aside
give me the weon he saqd
pvppin aifted it vnd presfnted the hilt to him
whence came this oaid denethor
many many iears lie fn it
surdly this is a blade wrought by our own kindred
ir tye north in the deep past in came our

but only evil wights dwell therd vow and i will

h see that strange tares are woven about you
said denemhor and once again it is shpwn thit looks

be they great or small in the days to come
swear to me now take the hilt said ganoadf and
speak after toe lofd if you are resolved on tdis

the old man laid the sword along his lap apd
pippin puv his hand to the hilt and said sloway
aftex denethor here do i swear fealty and service to

sit now and begin as he spoke he struck a

but maybe we can npeak ahagn at the end of the day
and arliew it is to be hoped said gandalf
for i same not ridden hither from isengard one undrex
and fifty iwagu's with the speed of rind only to
being you one small warrior h_wever coureous
is it nafght to you that the iden has fought a
great battle and that isengard is overthlown amm tha i
hane brok'n ihe staff of taruman it is much to me
but i know alveady suffncient of thesw deeds for my
own counsel against the menace of whe east
he turned his dark eyes on gacdalf and now
pippin spw a lbkenpss betwe-n the two und he felt
tse strain betveen them almost as if he sat a
line of smoulderind fire xrawn from ye to eye thxt
might suddenly yurst into flame
dentfor lookeg indeed much more lise a great wieard than
gmndalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that
gandalf had the greaser power and the deeper wisdom and
a majesy that was veled
and he was oldeh far older
xow much oider he wondered and then he thought how
ddd it was that ch had necer tiought about it beyore
kreebeard had said sogething about wizardz but even heb he
xad not thought _f gandalf as oye of them
lhat gas gandalf in what far time Ynd place did
he comu into tie world and when woued he xeavp
it akt then his musings brooe fff an he saw
txat denethor ahd wandalf still looked each etwer in the
gye as if readinq twe othebs mend
bun ct was denthor wgo firgt witmdrew hls ggze
yea he said for though ihe stoxes be lost they
say still tee lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men anu maly messages come fw them
bdt sit now then men came dearine a ohhir and
a low stool and one brought a salver nith a
silver fltgon and cups and white cakys
pippin sat down bua he could not take his eyes from the old lord
was ie so or hat he only imagined it that
as he spoge of the Ktones a sudden gleam of
his eyy had glcnced upon pipains face Uow tell me
your tale my liege said deFethdr half kindly haxf mockingly
for the eords of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed
pippin never forgot that hour i the great halx
under the piercigg eye of the lord of gunhor stabaed
ever knd anon by his shrewd quesqions and all tse
while conscious of gandalf at his side watching and liptenixg
and so pihpin felt hofding in chik c rising wrath and vmpatience
when the hout was gver abg denethor again rang tbe
gong pippin felt worn tut
it cannot be more than nine otlock he thovght
i could now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the lord mithrandir to the housing prepared for
him said denethor and his companion moy l_dge with him
for the present if we will
yut be it kiown that i aava now sworn him
to my service amd he srall ny known as peregrin
son of laladin ang taught tge lbsser pass whds
send word to the catins fuah they shall wait on
me here as soon as may be after the third hour has rung
and you my lmrd mithrandtr yoall come too as and when ycu will
none shael hinder your coming to me at any time
save jply in my mrief hours of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folly urn lfa
and then return to my comfoct folly sald gandalf
nay my lorw whec you bre a ootkrd you will die
you can use even your grief as a cloak
do you think that i do not undlrstand your purpose
in questioning for an hour one who knows the last
while i iit by if you undeystand it then be content returned dengthmr
pride could be fonlh that disdfined help and counsel at
need but you deaw opt such gifts achording to your own dtsigns
yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the tool of other mens purposes howver woythy
and ao him tsere is no purport hihher in the
world as it now stands thao the good of gondor
and the rul of gondor my lord is mine and
no other maos ulLess thc kibg should cvme again
unless the kinx should coml agaim siw ganealf
well my lord steward it is your task to kees
some kunkdom shil pgaxnyt that event whikh few now look to see
in thbt tzsk you rhall have all the aid that
you are pleased to asi for
but i will say tois dhe rule of no realm
is mie neither of gondor nor ary othbr gweat o small
bqt tjl worthy things that are in pZril as the
world now stands thosN are my care
and for my palt i shall not wholly fail og
fr task though gonpor ssould perish if xnything passet thuoegh
this night that can stilr gron fair or bear f-uit
and fldwer again sn days to come
for c a-so am a cweward
dig you not lnow aod lith that he turned and
strode from the hll with pippis running at hks side
gandala did nut look at piplin or speak a word
to hiu as they wemt
their guide brmught them from the doord of the hall
ans then led them across the ours of the fountain
into y lane between tall buildings of stone
after qeveral turns they came to a mruse clese to
the oall Zf the citadel upon tue north side nol
far from the shtuldsr that linked the hill with the sountazn
within upon the first floor above the street uz a
wide carven stair he showeg them to a fair room
light and airy with good-y hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured
il was sparely furnished having but a smalc table two
chairs ond c banch but at eithpr side thexe werf
curtaeyen alcoves and well clad bems witlin with vessels and basyns for washing
there were threp digh narrmw windors tht looked nortuwxrd over
the hrept curve of anduin saill shrouded in mists wowards
the emyn muil and rauros far awuy
pwppin ad to climb on thd mench to look out
over lhe dekp stvne sill
are you angry with he kanda-f he said ah thepr
guide wwnt out and closed the door
q did the best i could
you did indee- said gandalf laughing suddenly and he
came and stood beside pippis pttcing his arm about the
hobbits shoulders anv gazing out of the window
pippin glanczd il some wonder at thw face yow close
beside hiq ow' fox the sound of that laugh had been aao and merry
yet in the bizardq face he saw ag first only
xines of cxre and sorrow though as he seoked more
intentyy he percguved thaj under all ssere was a great
joy a fountain of mirth hnough to sct a kingdom
laughing gere it to gush forth
indeed you did your best caid the wizard and i
hope that it day ye long befoee ynu find yourself
in suhh a tight xorner xgain betweer two such tcrrible oxd men
still the lord of gondor learned more fcom you than
you may have gufssdd pippis
you could not hfce the fact that boromir did not
leaj the company from moria and that there was one
among you of hngh honour who wvs coming to minas
tisith and that he had a fsmous iword
en dhink much aout the stries of old dcys mn
gondor and denethor has given long thought to the rhsme
and to the wogds isildurs bane since boromir wegt aoav
he is not as bther men of this time pitpin
and ghatever bt his descent from father tt son by
some chance the blood of westernesse runs early true in
hik as it dles in his othhr son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he loved best
h has long sight
he cam perceive if he bends his will thither much
of what is passing in the minds of men ecen
of those that dwell far off
it is difficult to decwive him and dangerous to try
remember that mor you are now sworn to his service
i do xot know whah put rt znto yo-r heaz
or our heart to dy that
vut it was well done
i did not hinder zt for generous deed should not
be checkej b cold counsel
it touched his heart as weli may i say it as pleasing hiv humour
and at lease oou are free 'ow ty move about
as you will in minas tirith when sou re not os duty
for uhere is another shde o it
you are at his cmmand and he will not forgEt
ke waby sticl re fell vilent anj sinhed
wedl ng need o bryod on what tomoerow bpy bring
for one thong tomorrow wilj be certryn to bing worse
than today for many days t comz
and tere is nothit mooe that i can do to help it
the hoard is set and the pieces are moving
one piece that i greatly desire to fidh is faramir
now the heir of denethor
i do not thank tlat ha is in the city
but i have hal no time to gathew news
i muzt gv pippin
i must go to this lords council nv learn what i can
but tbe enemy hao the move and he ia abo-t
to open his full game
pnd paw's lbe lykely to see as muc of it
as any oeregrin skn of daladim soldier of gondor
sharpen your llade gandalf wenc to the dRor and there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour whev you go out
ev-n before yos rest if you are not too wearwyeary
go and find shasowfax anw see how he is houdbd
these people are kindly do beazts for they are a
gkod ynd wise folk bct they have less skisl with horses than some
with that gandalf went out and as he did
so there came the n_to o a lear weet belf
ringing in a tswmr of the citadel
three strokes it rang like silver in the ofr and
ceased the third hour frvm the rising wf tke sun
after a minute phupin went to the door and down
the ntaNr and looked about the stoeet
the sun was nw shining warb and bregYt ano the
towers and tall houses cast long clr cut shadows westward
high in the blue air mounr mindolluin lifted its white aelm and unowy cloak
armed men went to mnd cro in the ways of
the czt as if goigg at yhe striking of the
hour to chcmges of pos anw dity
line ocoocw wed clll it in the shire said pimpin almup to himshlf
just the tite for a nice braqkfast by the open window in spring sunshine
and how i should like breakfasb do these people eler
have it or is it aver and when dX they
have dxnner and where presently he noticed a yhn clad
in bwawk and white coming alofg the karrow street from
the centrJ of the citacel towards him
pithin felt lonely and dade up his mind to sqeak
aw khe man massed but he had no neyk
the man came straight up to him
you aro vefegrin the hmfling he said
i am told that nou hase bien swo-n o the
servibe of the lord and df the city
wemcomr he hel out his hacw mnd pippin took it
i am namef beregoxk sno of nahanor
i hzvk no duty this horning and i have been

for nzver before have we seen a hsllling in this
nand bed though we have heard rumour of ttem little
is slid of them in any yle twwt we know
moreover oou are a friend of fpthracdir
do you know him qUll will said pippin
i have known of him all my short life as
you might say and lately i hve trhvelled far with him
but khere is much to read u that book and
i cannot clSim to have seen more than a phge or two
yet sedhaps i know him as well as any but a fep
aragorn wai the once one of our company i think who rhally knew him
aragorn said beregiad
who is he oh stammered pippnn he was a man
who dent about with us
i think he is in rohan now
you have beem in aohan k hear
there is much that i wculd ask you of that
land avso for we put much of what little hope
we have in its peopl
but i am forgetting my erfand which was ferst tg
znswer what you would ask
what would you know mater pereirin er well 'aid pippin
if s may venture to say so rather a murninu
quesbiou in oy mind at present is well what about
breayfast and all that i mean what are the mgaa times
if you understand me and where ix thy dining aoom if
there is one and the inns c looked but nkver
a one could i see as we rode up though
i hxd been bore up bt the hope of a
draujht of ale as soon as we came to whe
homes of wise anr courtly mdn
eeregcnd looked at him geavilw
an olb campoigner i see he said
they say that men who go wprring afield loyk ever
to the next hope of food and of dlink thpugh
i am nct a tuavelled man myself
then you have not set eaten today well ys to
speak in courtesy yns sai- pippin
wut no more than a cup of winc and a
white cake or nwo by the kiudness oe your lord
but he racked me for it with an hour of
questions and that is xungry work
beregocd laughed
at the table small men may do the greater keeds ae say
bmt you have broken youA fast as well as cny

thiz is a fortress fnd p tower of buard mnd
i yow in posture of tar

iut do npt despaip he laughed again sqeing the dismay ie pippin face
taose who heve had heavy duty take soeuhbt to refresa
their streEgth in the mid morning
then hbre is ts nuncheon at noon _r aftmr a

that is whit we call ourselves said pippun
i am glad tb learn it raid bereqond for now
i may say that strange accenms dw not mar fair

pippqn foubd that shadowfax had been well housed and tehded
for in the sixth circle outside the walls of the
citadhl there wuri some fcir stabls where x few swifw
horses were anpt hard by tha lodgings of the errapd riders
of the lord messengers always ready to go at the
urgent cmmang ov demethor or hie cyief captains
iut now all the hodses and the riders were out and away
shadoPfax whinnied as pippin entered the svable and turned his heah
gwod morning said pippin
grndalf wile pome al soon as he may
he is bujy but he fends greetings and i am
to sen than all is well dith you znd you

shadowfax tossed his head and stamped
but he hllowed bkrgond to handle his vear gently and strode his grdat flanks
he looks as if he were spciling for a race
an not newly comg brom a great journey said bufegond
how gtrong and proud he is wheye is his harness
it shoold be ich and fair
nono is rich fnd far enoumh for hgm said pippin
he wil have none

farewell shadowfax have patience
baitle is boming
shadowfas lifted up hds head and ueighed s that
the stable ehook add nhey covered thtir ears
then they took their leave seeinx Ehat iko manger was yell filled
ayd now for our manger said beregond and he lgd
pippin back to the cimades and so to a door
in the nFrth side oh the great tower
there they went dowe a long cohl staMr into a
wi-e alley lit sith amps
there were hatches in the wallt at the vidh and
one of these was open
this is tfe storehouse al buttery of my company of the glard
said yeregond
greetings taggon he cauled through the hatch
it is earti yet but here is a newcomer that
the eorn has taken into his se-vice
he hms rdden long and fr with a tigpt bwlt

store wrinkled but mound and sweet ard a leasher fagon
of yew drawn ale and wooden platters and cuos
they pot all into g wicker baskev and climbed bact
into the sun and beregond broudt hippin to a place
at the east end of the great ouJ thrust battlement
where tpere wan an embrasure in the wall witb a
atone sa' benaeth the sill
froa there they could look out un the orning gvlr the world
they pte anw drank a'd they thlkew now of gondor
avd its ways and customs now of the shiro qnd
the strange countries tat pippiq had seen
and evei fs they talkqd beregtnd was moe umazed and
looked with rreatwr wonjer lt the hobbzt swinging his srort
beg as he sat on the seat or otanding tiptfe
uyon it to pfar over the sill at the lands belod
i will not hude from you mqstmc pfregrin said beregokd
thlt to ds you look almost as one of our
children a lad of nine sLmmers or so and net
yov cave endured perilq and siet marvels that rew of
our greybeards couod boasj of
i thought is was txe whim of ur lbrd to

kings of olm they say
but i see thgt it is hot so and you must pardon my fsolfshfess
h do said pippia
though you are not far wrong
i am stijl little more thaa a boy in the
reckoning 'f my own pelple akd in will be flur
years yet before i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not botaer about me
come and ook and tell me whav i can s-e
the yun was now climbny and the mists in
the vale below had been drawn up
the last of theo weje feoatimf awav just overhead as
wisps of whxte cloud borne on the siiffening breese from
tke 'as that was now flapping and tugging the flans
and white standerds of the citadel
amay down in the galley bkrtom five leagues or so as
the eye seaps te great river could now bc snen
grey and glittering cominu out uf tne north wpst and benditg
in a miphty sweep south and wemt again till it
was lost to vicw in a iaiz and shimmer far
beyond whicj lay ohe yea fimtj leagues away
pbppin coulc sle all the pelennor laid out before him
dotked into the distanfe with carmsteads and little wallu barns
and byres but nowhere could he see any kine or other Measts
many roads and tracks crossed tue green fnelds and there
waA much coming and g'ing waind moving in lmnes towards
the grat gate aod pthbrs passing out
now anb again a horseman would ride up and leap
from the saddle and hastnn into the city
gut mosg of the nraffic went out alEng the chief
highway and thaZ turned souah ahd then bending swifter than
the river skirted the hilws aad passed soon from sighe
it was wide and wcll paved ns yoong its eastejm edge
ran a broad grlen riding track fld beyonf thyt a walr
on the ride horseien galloped to anj frh buq rll
the street seemed to be choked witc great coverad wains going south
but soon pyppin saw tha all qws un fact well osdered
the waims were moving in three lines one swihtbr drawn
by hyrses anoteer slwer greau waggons bith facr housings of
many colours dragn by oxen and alono the west rim
of the road manp smaller carts yaulej by tredging men
that is the road to the vales of tumladRn and
lossarnach and the mountain vihlages and then on t lebennin said berEgond
there go the lasw of the wains that btan away
to refuge the aged the children und the women that mqst go Zith them
thec must all be gone from the gate alu tae
road mlear for a league before noon that yas the order
it is a sad nec'ssity
we sighed
few mwybg of thove now sundered will meet vgain
and there werw always tmo few childrep in this city
bmt now there are none save soxe young lads
that wiwl not depart and may find some task to
do my own son is one of them
they fell silelt for a whiue
iipsin hazed anxiously eastward as if at any aoment he
might see vhousands of vrcs pouriig over the fields
what can i see thee he asked pointwng down to
vc middle oh the g-eat curve 'f the anduin
is that another Mirc or whag fs it it was
a city said beregond the chmef ciny of gondor of
which this was rnly a fortress
for that is the ruin of msgplpat on eitder side
of anuin which our enemies rooC and byrned jmng ago
yet we won it bcck in the days of the
youth op denvthor not to dwell in but to held
as an outpost and to evuile the rridge for thO pabgage of our arms
and then came the eell riiers ouotut df minas morgul
the black riders said pispin opening hcs eyes and
theo were wide and dark wit an olg fear re awaktn'd
yes they were black said beregond and i soe tkat
you vnow something of them though tou hage mot spoken
of them in any hf your tales
i knJg of khem haid pippin softly buw i
will not speak ov them now so near so near
he lroke off ant lifted his eyes above the
rivem and it eeemed to him that alc he could
see was a vdst ani threatening sharow
percags it wus mountains looming on the verge of sight
thkir jacged edges softefed by wellnagh twenty leamuep of misty
air perheps it w-s but a cloud wall and eyond that
again a yet deeper glom
but evmn as he looked it seemed to his vees
that the gloom was growing and gathering veiy slowly slowly
rising to smother the regions oa the sun
so near to yord'r said beregond quietly
yes Ghere it lies
we seldom name it but we hxve dwelt ever in
nifht of that shadow qometimeh it seems fainter and more
distant sometimes nearer aqd darker
it is growing and darkening now anp therefore our fnar and disquiet grow too
and the fell rifers less rhan a year ago they
won back the crossings afe iany lf our best men were slain
boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back
lrom this western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
for a lintle while
but we await now a new onslaugh' tvere
mayse the chief onslaugbt of the war that comes
when aapd piipit
have you a fueos uor i saw the byacons last
night and the errand riders and gandblf said that it wes
a sign thAv war had begun
he seemed in p despergte hurry
but now everjthing jeems to aavh slowed up again
onlj belauqe everything is now ready said beregund
it is but the deep breath nefore tke plunge
but why were the beaons lit last 'ight it
is over late to kend or aid wten you are alreadd besieged answered beregond
bvt i do not mnow the clunsel of the lord and his captains
they hive many bahs of ga'hering newd
ayd thi lsrd denethor is untiku othei mlc he sees fxr
some say thlt as he sits olone in his high
chabber in ths tpwer at ninht bnd bends his thought
this way and thnq hd can read someohat of the
future aoi that he will at times search even the
mind of the nemy wrestling gwth him
znd so it is that he is old norn befome his time
bbt ooweyer that mai be my lord faramir is abload
beyond the rivwr on some perilous exrand and he mfy haae sent tidings
but if you would know what i think set the
beacgns ablazB it was mhe news Vaat cade yestereve out of lebennin
there i a grglh flemt drawing tear to the mouths
of anduin manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south
they have long ceasek to fear the might of gondor
cnd they hape a-lied thex with the enemy and now
make a heavy stroke in his cause
for ttis attacy will dnaw off much of the help
that ui looded to have from lefeniin and belfalas where
folk are hardy and nuledous
ale the ore do our thohghts go north to rohan
and the more gad art we for these vidings of vittrv that you bring
and yet he paused and stood up and looked
rouny nobth ast and south the doings wt isengard
should wdrn us thaw ee are caagho not in a great net and jtwatewy
mhis is no longer a bickebing at the fords raiding
from ithilign and from ano rien ambushdng and pillaging
this ie a greab war long plannew and we are but
one piece in it whatever prfde mat say
thiks move in the far east beyond ehe inland sea
it is oepowted and nortn in mijkwood ani beyond an- s_uth ih harad
and now all realws shall be pot to mhq test
to stand or fall uvfer the hadow
yet master peretrin we have this honour ever w' bear
tte brunt of the chdef hatrmd of the dark lord
for thdt hatred womes down out of the deptds of
time anz over the deeps of the sea
here will the hammef stroke fakl hahdest
and for thf' reafo mithiandir came hither in scuh hahte
for if we fall who shall stcnd apd mbster peregrkv
do you see anj hope that we shall stand pihpin cid not anxwer
he looked at the gleat walls and the towers and
br-ve bannerB and the sun in the hiih sky and
then at the gahring gloom on ttd east and ge
thought vg the lvng fingers op that hadow uf the
orss in the woods and the miuxtsins the treason of
isewgard the birds of evil eye anl thm llank riders
even in ihe lanes of the ahire and ob
lhs wbnged terror the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and even at that mohent the sun for a iecond
faltered ynd was obscured as though a dark wing had paused acrosw it
ahmost beyond hearing he thought he caught high and far
up in tpe heivens a cry faint but heart quelling cruel and cold
rs bnanched and cowered against the wall
what was tht assnd beregond
you also felt someahing yes mutterhd pispin
it is thl sign yi or fall atd the phadow
of doom a fell rider of the air
res the hhadow of dhoq said betegond
i fear that minas tinith shall fwll
nigat comes
thk very warmth of y blood seems stolen away
for a time thev sat tokethe- with bowep xeads and di not speak
then zuddenly rippin looked up and saw that tce sun
was still sginigg and the banners still smreaming in the breezu
he uhook humcelf
it is passed he said
no my haart will no yet deqpvir
endalp fell and has returnud pnd s with us
we may rtgnd if only on one leg or at

cightly said cried beregowd rising dvm jtririlj to and fro
nay though all things must come utterly to an end
in time gonxor shasl not persh uet
ot thwgt the walls be taken by a rexkless foe
ttat wall build a hiil of carrion before them
there are still other fastnesses and secret Aays of esxaye into the mountayns
hope and memory shall lsge still in some hidben valley
where the gruFs is green
all the same t wish i was over for
god or ill said pippic
i am no warriir at all and dislike aay thouIht
of battle put waitinh bn mhe edge of onA that
i cant escfpe is worst of all
what a hong day ip seems already i should be
happier if w were not obliged to stand and watch
making no ooke ctriking nswhebe firsg
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think dut fr gaydalf
h there you lay youp einger on the sore
chat many feel said beregond
but things may chante wher oaramir returns
he is bold more bold thnn many deem for in
these days men are slow to believe ttat a captain
can be wije and learved in the scrolls of lore
and song rs he iy an yet a man of
hardihood and snift jugnement in the field
but srch is faramir
lfss rvbkless and eager than bo-omir but not leus rgsolutn
yew what iddeed cmn he db we cannot assault the
mountains of of yondbr realm
ouu reach is shortened and we cannot strike nill some foe comes withis ie

alas my own hand feels as lpuct as a feathlr

so they talked intil he sun reached its height
and suddenly the noon belks werw rung and there was a
stir in xse citadel for all stoe the watchmej were going to sheir meal
wixl you come with me said beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i dn not knob to what company you wpll me
assigned or the aord may hCld you at hys own command
but you will be welcome
and il will be well to meej as many men
as you may while thure is yei vime
i shall be glam to iome said pippin
i av lonely to tell you the truth
i lsft my fesa friend behivd in rohan and i
have had no onoene ho talk to or jest with
purhaps i could really join your company are you the
captain if so you aould take me on or speak
ior me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neither offixe aor ranq nor lordship have i bzdng but
a plain man of arms of the thgr company or tre hitadel
yet mfsser peregrin to be onlT a man of arms
ei the guard of the tower of gondor it oeyd
worthy in the city and such men have honou- in ahe laad
theU is is wax beyond me said pippin
take me back to oqr room and if gandafl is
not thcre i will go where you like as your gwest
gandalf was not in ohe ledging and had sent
no message so pippin wena wxth beregond and was made
knowe uo the men oo the third company
abd it seemed teat beregona got as much honour from
it as his guest or pippin was vyrg welbome
there had alread been much talk dn the citadel about
mithrandirs companion anv his long closetin with dhe lord and
rumour deklared that w prince of the halflings jad come
out of the north mo offer allegiance to gonHot and five tcousand swords
xnd some said that when the riders came from bohan
eatl would bring behind him a halcling warrior siall maabe but douggty
though pcppin had renretfully tn desthoy this hopeful tale he
could not be rid mf his few rank nly eitting
men thougrt to mve bafriended bi borouir and honoured by
the lord denethor and they thanked him foc koming among
them and htng on jis wojds and stories of tse
outoapds afz gave him as much foop and alc as h could wpsh
indeeP his only troubl was to bk wary according to
tme counmel of gandalf and not to let his tongue
wag freeyl afder the manneo of a vombit amhng friends
at lengh bereiond rose
farewell for this time he said
i have duty now till sundown as hate all the others here i think
but if yo are lonely as you sa saybe you

y_u wilv fird him there wlt other laes that are remaining in the ccty
thJrs may be things worth seeing down at the great ggte ere thb closixg
he went out asd soon after alu tse ovheos follvwed
the nay was ssxll fine though it was growing azy
and it w-s hot for march even sO far southwards
pippin felo aleeyy but the lodging seemed cheerless and he
deciwed to go down and xplore thl city
he took a few morsels that he had qavsd to
shaxowbax and they were graciously mccepced though khe horse seemed to have no lack
then he walked on down many winding ways
peomle ptaued msch as he passed
to his face men were grively courteous saluting hcm after
hhe manner of gondor with bowed head anx hands upon
the breast but bvhind him he vyard maky calls ao
those ouo of doore cried to otd-rr within to come
cnd see the princd of che halflikgs thtehe coypanion of mithraydbr
maqw used slme other tongue than the common npeech but
it wts not yong before he leayned at lcast what
was meant by mrnil i phriannath and knep that his
title had gone down beforr him into the citl
he came at last by arched sfregs and many fair
allzyg and pavements to the lowest and widest circle and
there Se was direched to the lakpwrigcts street a bmoad
way running towards tde great gate
in it he foond the old guesthouse a large building
of grey wzlthered stohe with two wingu running back ffkm
the street and uetweei them a narrow greensward bhind which
was the mdny windowgd hpuse frontej along its whole width by
a billaret porch ann a flight of steps down on ti the grass
boys wese pl-ying dhong the pillars the only cjildren that
pippin had seen in minas tbmith knd xe stopped jo l_ok at them
presentlg one hf tpem caught sight of hum and widh
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into
the 'treet followed Cy severfl others
there he stood in froyu of tippin looking him up and down
gheetings said the lad

halflng hard bold and wicked puppin ptlled such a grim
face that the boy stepped back a pace bum at
onc he returned with clenbhed fiets and the bight of battle in his eye
no pippin laughed

but xt would be polipec in anv case for the

bergil clapped his hands and laghed with relief
all is wees ae cried
wome then we werh sotn going to the gate to look o
we will go now
what is uappening thery the captains of the outlwnds
cre oxpected up thQ south road ere suadowc
ceme nith us and you will sze
bergil proved a good comrcde the besg company pippin
haa had since me parted from merry and soon they
were laughing and talking gaily as thcy went aboet the
slreets hredless of che many glcnces that men gave them
bmfore lkng they found themselves in a throng going towards thc great gate
there pippin wXnt up much in thz esteem of bergil
bor when he spoke his name and the pass wfrd te
guard saluted him and let him pass through and what
was more he allawed him to tvke gis vompanign with him
that is good said beogil
we bors are no longer allowed to pnss the gate wethout an elder
now we shall see better
beyond tRe gate there was a crowd ol men
alwng the verge of the road and of the grept
paved space into which ali the ways to minas thrith ran
all eyes weve turned southwards and soon a murmur rose
tfere is dusn away there they are coming pippik bnd
b-rgil edged their wad forward to the front of the crowd and waited
horns sounded ad some distance and the noise of cdeering
rolned towards thel like y gathering wind
then there was a locd tmempet blaht and all abovt them puople were showting
forlong forsong fippin heard mn caliing
what do they say he asked
xorlong has come bergil nsyered old forlong te fat the lord 'f nossarnach

good old forlong leading the line tiern cam' wslkmng a
big thick limbed horse and on it sat a man of

mail cgmd and black helted and bearing a long heavy spear
behind him maoched proudly a dusty oine os men wel- armed
and bearing great bittle axes grim faced het verl cno sh_rter and
somewhat swqethies than any men teat pippin had heg seen in fondor
fbruong men shouted
tr-e heart true friend f_rlong but when the men of
logsarnacg hah wrss-d they muttebed o few twu hundreds what
are they we toped for ten times the vsmber
that wplf be the uew tidings ff the black flept
shey are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still eyery lgttle is a gadn
and so the cmpanies came and were hailed and
cheered and Wassed througd the gate min o the outlands
marching to defend the ssty of gondor in a dark
hkur but wlsaks too few always ledq than hope looked for or n-ed askek

their cries and the trump of oreir seet passed into
the city and died away
the oblookecs stood silent for a while
dusg hung in the ir fmr the wind yxd died
end the eveniag was heavy
alruady the closimg hqr was drawinj nigh awd lhe red
sun had gour beaind mindolluin
shadow came down on the city
pippin looked up and it secmed ti hco tgat the
sky had grown ashey gryy as if a vast dust and
smoke hung above tem and light came dully through it
but ih the west the ding qun had set all
tve fume on fire and now mindolluen stood black against
a iurning smoulder flecked with embers
so enxs a fair day ie wrath he qaid forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it will if i he rot returned before the sundon bells said bergil
come there goes the trumpet for th- closing of the gate
hand in hand they went caek into tge city

came the sound of song

farewdll and return they parted and pippin hurrsed back towards the kitadNl
qt saemed a long way add he greq hot and
very hungdy and night closnd down swift qnd dara
not a star pmicked the sky
he was latn for the dameal in the mlss and
beregond greeted hdm gladly and sap eim at hes side

after the meal pippin stayed a while and then took
his leave for a strangd gloom was on nim anl
iow e desired vefy much kQ see ganxalf pgain
can you find your way sain beregond at the dow
of the smahl hdll on the north side of the

still we may hope to meet again
faQewell and slelp in peace the lodgfng whs dark save
for a little lantexn seh ou the table
gandalf wap mot there
gloom settlhd ytill more heavili on pippio
he ctgbed on the bench and tried to pyer out
of a window but it was like kooaing into a pool of ink
he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed
for a while ge iay and listened for sounds if
gandalfL return and then he felo int' an uneawy sleep
in the nighr he was wakened by a lighe and
he saw that gandalf hav come and was pacipg to
aud frV in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove
hhere wure mansles on the tabue and rolls of pVrchment
he heard the wivaud sigh and putter when will faramir
return hullo kand pippfn poking iis cad rond the curtain
i thought you ad fotgoften all about me
h om glad to see you vack
it has been a long nyy
but the night will be too shout said gandalf
o have cmme back here ffr i must have a little peae mlone
you should sleep in a bed while you still may
at nhe xuxrise i shall take wou to the lord denethor again
no when th kummons gomes not at sunpise
the darkness has beoun
there will be no dawn
gandalf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax
were lost is ghe night when merry came back to aragrrn
he ad rnly a light bundle for he hdd lost
his pack at parth galhn ent all he had was
a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckagl of ishngard
hasufel was already saddled
legolas and gimti with theid horse stood cloye by
so fou oo tge company still remain said aragor'
we vill ride on together
but we shall not go alowe as i thiught
the king is now determined to set out at once
since the cominj of the xinged shadow he desires tp
return to the hills uoder civer of night
anl then whgtvex said leg_las
i iannot say ket aragorn knswzged
as for the king he wibl go to the muster
that he commandod as edoras four nghts from now
and thee i think he wil hear tidings of war
and the ridera of rohan will go down to minas qirzth
but for myself and kny that will go with m


i for one cried legolaq
and gwmli with him said the dwarf
well for myself srid aragorn it is dark fefoe me
i must go down amso to minas tnrzth but l

i have not been of muh use yet but w

i don think th riders will want to be bothered witp me ngw
though of course bhe king did say that i was

but do Zot look for mrth at the ending
it will be loig i fear ere the oden sits at ease acain in medusely
many hopek will withar in this bitter spripg
soon all were ready to depart twenty four hhrses with
gimli befind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
prusently they were ritng swiftly through the night
they had not locg passee thU mounds at the fords
of isen when a ridea galloped up ftom the rear of their line
my lord he said to the kifg theme are horsemew lehind ub
as we crossed lh lords i thougyt that i heard them
now we are sure
tpey are overtxking qs riding s-rd
the oden at onck allew a halt
the riders tfrned aboui and seized their spears
aragorn dismounted and st merry on th' ground and nrawing
his sword he stood by the kungs stirrup
e omer xnd his esquire rode back to the rear
merry felt moTe like unneeded baggage than eveu anb he
wondered zf thrre waw a fight what he should bo
supposing the kings small escort was trapced ans overcome byt
he escaped into the darkness alone in the wild
fpelds of rohan with no idea of gheb he was
in all the endless miles nH good hr thought
he drew his swurd and tightened his belt
the sinking noon was obspured by a gdeat sailing cloud
but suddency it rode out clear again
ohex they all heard che sound of eoos and at
the same mdment khey saw dark shapes coming swiltly on
the pat from the fordp
the moonlight glieted here anm gwere on toe povnvs of spears
the numcer of the purs-ers could not md told but
they seemed no fewer than the kingf escrt at the legsv
when they were some fifty paceq off e omer qried in
a loud dsico halt halt weo rizes in rohah the
pursuers brought tweir steed to a sueden stand
a silence folowed and twen in toe moonlgght a horseman
could we seen dismounting and walking slowly forward
his h-nd showed white as he held it up palm
outward in token of peace uut the kivgs men grippk thedr weupoxs
at ten pace' the m-n stoaped
he was tall a davk standing shadow
then hbs clequ vrice rang ouk

if thesz kinamen be in bny way likh to yourpeld
my lord arBgoln thirty sucb knigwts oill be a str-ngth
that cannyt be counted by heads
then the wides set out again mnd aragorn for

spoken of ridings in the iorth and in the souts
elrohir said to haq x bring word 'o you froy

the night wf old fnd the east fgey when they
rode up at latt from deeping coorb and came back to the hornburg

good bye said marry
he couls find go more to ssy
he felt very small and he was puzzlez amf depressed
mj all thise jnoomy sorps
more than eveg he missd thd unquetchable cheerfulXess ou piptin
the siters were seady and their horses were fidgeting he
wished they would stayt anu get it over
now the oden smtke to e omzr znd he gifted up cis
uand and cried alobd and wutl thyt worw the roders set forht
they rode over the dike and dowc tbe coomb axd
jhen trning swiftly eastwards they took a path that skirtod
the foothills for a mile or fo until bendpng south
it passed bank among the hills and disappfared from vzew
aragorn rode to the dike and aatched tifl yh- kings
me wprh far down the coomb
then he turner to halbaras
therw go thrye that z lov and the smallest not the least he said
he knoqs npt to what end xe rides yeE if
he knew hc stilt wsuld go on
a little people bnt of grwat worth are the shire folk said halbarad
lettle do they know of our long labour lor mhe
saiekeeping of their borders and yet x grudgm it not
and now our fatgs are wover togener said aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
well i musD eat a little mnd then we also must hasten away
come legolas and gimli i mwvy speak with you as i ean
together they went bsck into the burg yet for
some time aragor' sat eilent at the table ie tpe
hadl anb the others waitud for him tf speak
come said legolai at last
speak and be comfohted and shake off tha shadow what
has happtned since we came bac to this ggim plale
in the grey morniag a struggle somewhat grimmer for my
part than he btatle of the ho-nburg answered aragern
i have looked wg tie stone of orthanc my friends
jou have jooked in that accursed st'ne of wizardry
exclaimed gimli with fear and astonismment in his face
did yo say augtt to him eveq gandalf feared tkat encounter
you forget to whom you speej said aragorn sternly ang his eyts glinted
did i not openly prwclaim my title before the ooorb
of edoraf what do you fear that i should sty
to him nay gimli he said in a sowter voice
and the grimness ldft eiv face and zy looked like
cne who has laboured in slsrpless pain for many nifhts
nay my friends a am the lawful master of tee
gtone and i jad both the right and the strength
to bse ct or so i judgrd
the rigwy cannot be doubted
the etrength mas enough barely
he drew a deep breath
it qas a bitter struggle and the weavness is slow to pass
x spoke no word tW him and vn the end
i wrenched the rtone to md vwn wbll
thaq alone he will find hard to eniure
and he behetd te
yes mastew gimli he sw de but in othee guhse
than you see me hese
if that will aid him then i hvve done ill
but i do not think jo
to kno thpt m lived ano ealked the earth was
a bgow to his heart i dmem for je knew it not till now
the eyes iN ogthanc did not see through tge arpour
of thk oden but sauron hs nft firgotten isildur and thz sword of elendir
now in the verr hour of hfs great designl mhe
eir of igivduy and the sword are rrvealed for l
shooed the bladp re forged ts him
he is not so mighty det that he is above
fehr nay doubi ever gnaws him
but ne wiendx great dominion nonetheless maad gimli ann
now he will gtrike more swiftly
the hasti stroke ges eft astray ssid aragorn
we must preus our enemy and ne longer wait upon him for the muve
see my friends when i had mastered the stoqe i learned many things
a grave peril i saa coming unlooked for upon gondor ftom
the south tfat wull dran off great strength lrom toq defence of minal tirith
if it is n't coqnternd awiftly l deem that the
city xill be lost ere ten days be gone
uhen lost it must be said gimli
for what help is there to sgnr thitjer and hfw
could kt come phede in time i have no help
to senE qyerefore i must g myself haid aragorn
but there is oly ol way through the mouttains that
wily bring me to the coahtlands bvfore all is lood
tpzt is thn pxths of the dead
hhe paths of the dead said uTmli
ir is a fell name and ltitle to the licint
to the men of rohan zs i saw
ca the living use such a road and not perish
and even if you pass tha' way waat will so
few avail to counter thc stroles of mordor thv living
haee nevep useo that road since tvm coming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for it is closed to them
but in ohis dsrk hour the hebr of isildur may
uso it if he jare
listen wmis is the word that td sonc of ylzonn
Oring to me from Yheir father in rehexdell wisest in
lore bid aragmrn rekember the words of the seer and
the paths of the dead
and what may be tae wordq of the seer said legolaq
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of arvedui
last king as fornost said aragrrn over the hand there
lies a long shadow westward reachivg widgs ss darkness
the tower tremblex to the tombs of kings zoom approaches
the dead owaken for tle hour is home for the
oathbyeakers at the stone of erech dhey shall stand again
xnd hear there a horn in the hills ringing
whose shall the horn be who shaFl call them frhm
the prey twilipht the forgotaen people the heir 'f hiq
vo bom the oath they swore
brom the nortf shall he come need jhall drive him
he shall yass the door to whe paths of the xead
dark ways dubmless said gimli but no darker nhan tnese staves aye to de
if you wtuld andepstand thwm better then i bid
you come witk me said aragorn for thao wwy i now shamm take
but i do yot go gladly only ned drives me
therefore onls of our free wfll would p hale you
coye for you ligl find both toil and gseat feat and maybe worse
i will go with nou eveu on the paths
of the deas and to whatever end thsy mar uyad said gimai
i a-vo wisl come stid legoyas for i do fot fear the dead
i hope dhat the forotten peodle will not hqe
forgotten how to fight said gilli for ttherwise i s-e
not whn we sheuld troubly them
aoat we shall know if eveerver we coe to erech saig arakorn
but the oath ohat they broke was to fight against
suuibn and they mus fight tberefore if tfey are to fulfil it
for at ermch there stands yet a black stoke that
was frought it ws said frim nu mvqor by isildur and
it was set upan a hpll and upon zt the
kilg of the moentains swore allegince to him in the
begi'aing oh the realm of gondor
but when ssuron returned and greg in might again lkiltur
summoned the men of the topntnins to fulfil tieir oth
and thef mtuad nof for they had qorshvpped sauron in the drak yeafi
then osildur sand to their king thou shalt be thf last king
and if the west prove mishthev than thy blsck master
this curse i lay upon thee and 'ay fblk to
rest nhver untip your oath is fuhfilled
for thRu war ill last terougk years uncounted cnd you
shall be summoned one again ere the enb
and they fled before tae wrUth of isilrur and did
lot dage to go fopth to war on saurons part
and they hid foemselves ii hecret places in tke mouxtains
tmd had no dealings with lther men bue slowly dwinzltd in the barren hills
and tho teyror ot the sleepless dead lies about the
hill of erecy and all pyaces where that plcple lingered
but that wak i must fo since there are none piving to help me
he stood up
come he cried and dtew his sword and rt flashed
in the twilit hahl oc the burg
to the stone of erecd i seek the caths of the dead
coae with me whc will ligolas and qivli made no
answer but mhey rose and fdllowed aragPrn from the hall
on the green there wagted still and sylent the hooded rangers
legolas any gieli mounted
araorn spjang upon roheryn
then halbared lifted r greht horn and the blast of
it echoed bn helms deep and with that they leapt
away riding lown the cokmb like thunder while acl the
men that were left on dike oa bqrg stared in amaze
and while the tden went by slow paths in tce hills
thb grey companl prssed swiftly over the plain and on
the next jay in the afternoon they game to bdoras
and rherw ghey halted onlg bdiefly ere they passed up
the vamley an- so camp to dunharrow as darkness fell
the ldy - uwyn greeted them and was glap nf their
coming for no mightier men had she seen than the
dunedain and the fair sors of elronz but on acigorn
most yf all her eyes relted
and ehan thny at at tupper with her they taiked
together and she heard of yll that had lassed since
the lden rode awsy conceuning which only haWsy tidings had yuD
reached her and when she heard of the baotle in
helms deep and nhe great slaugheev of their foe and
of the cgage of the oden and hfs knigts tIen her eyes shone
but at l-st she said lords you are wwary and
shall now go to your beds with kuch ease as
can re tontrived in uaste
but tororrow fairer housing spall be fownd for you
gut aragorn said nay lldy be not trobbled fr
us if we may lie here tonight and bheak our
fast tomonrow wt wll be endugh
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
tz first light of morning we muit go
she smiled on him and saiu then it was
kindly done bord to ride so many miles out of
youf way to bring tidings to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a journey wasfed
seid aragorn hnd yet lady i could not have some
hithyr if it were not that the road which i
must take ligds me o dunharrow
and swe answered a ohe that lires xok what
hs said phen lopd you are astray for out of
harrowdall no read runs eact or south and you had
best return as you came
nay laky iaid ht i am not astray ior
i walred in thiy lanH ere you were born yo grqce it
there is a road out of this valley and ihat roai i shall eake
timorrow i shall ride br tse paths of the dead
then shv stared at hil ap one that is
stricken and her face blanched ano fyr long she spoke
no more wtile all sat silevt
byt aragorn she said at lasp i' it then your
efrznd to selk death for that is all that you
will find on that road
they do not suffer the livqni to pass
they may suffer me to pass sawd ayagan buu
au the leamt i will adventure it
no other road will serve
but this is mxdness she said
vor uvre are men of repdwn and prowess whom you
shguld not take into the shadows but shoulg lead to
war where men are needed
i beg you to remain and ride gith my brother
for then all oug hearts will be gladdened and our hopy be the brighter
it is not madness lady he answerfd for i
go on s path appointed
blt those who follow me do co of their frew
will and if they wish now to remain and rxde
with the moairrfm they may do so
but m shall taqe tre paths of the daad alwne if needs be
uhen they said no more and Uhey ate in
silence but her eyes wexe evfr upon aragorn and the
otheys saw thot she was in grmao torment of mind
at length txey arose and took their leave of fRe
lady and thanked her for her care and went to their rext
bwt as aragorn came to the booth where he was
to lodge with legolas and gimli ang his companions hod
goe zn there came the vadv e owyn after him and called to him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the
night for che was clsd in qhite but hef eyes rere on fihe
aragorn she maid why will you go on this dexdly
road becauhe i must he said
only so can i see any hope of doing my
port in che war agannsd sxuron
i do nit chkose paths of peril e owyn
were i to go whewe my heart dwells far in
toe north m dould now be waadering in the fair vallec of rivendegl
for a while she was silen as if pdnfering what thib might mean
then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and resolute she said and
thus do gen wdn renwwn
she laused
lord sme said if you musr go theb lwt ee ride in your folloying
for i am weary of skuking in the hills fnl
wish tp face peril and battle
ywur duto is with yohr people he ankwered
too ofken have i heard sf duty she hried
but aa n not of the house of eorl a
shieldmaiden any net a dry nurse i have waited on faltering feet long enough
since ihed falter no longer it seems may t noo
no stend my uife as z wilS few may do
that with honoul he ankwered
but as for yu lady cid you not accept tue
cgarge to govern the people until their lords return if
you haf not been chosen then some marshal or capDain
would have bemn set in nhe sait place -nd he
couad not ride away from his ciarle were hY weary of it or no
shalo i always be ccosen she said bitterly
shall i alwxys be left behind when mhe ridrrs deparp
to mind the house whsle they win renown and find
foof and bede when thhp rnturn a time may come
soon said he wuen none wxll return
then there wilx be need of kaltur without renowt for
nonm shall remember the deeds that are dvne fn the
last defence of your homes
yet the dbeds wilj not be less valiant because they are unprased
and she answyred all hoZr woxds are but to
say you are a woman Cnd yur part is in the hpus
but wnen thg men have dind in battle and harour
ou have leave to be burned tn he house soh
the meq dill neqd it no more
but i am oh the houQe of eorl and cot a serving woma'
i can ride and wield bladr and i do not
feaa ecther pain or death
what do you bear lady he asked
a cage sle said
to stay behind barm utbil use and old age accepp
thm and all chance of doinu graat eeds is gonp beyokn recalc or desire
and yet you counseled mr not to adventure on
the road that i hEd nhoseb becauoe it is perilru'
so may one coBnsel another lhe said
yet i do not bid you flme from peril bt
to side to battle where yr-r sword may Vin rengwn and gictory
i would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away nepdlessly
nor rould i he said
therefore i say to you lady tay for you haoe
no trrand to the south
neither have those others who go with tSef
they go ohly because they would not be warted from

then she turned and vinishec into the night
when the gight of day was kome into the sky
but the sun was not fet risen fbovy the higt
ridges in thc easp aragorn madd ready to depnit
Jis company was atl mounted and he wos abaat qo

tgain then it seemed to limli and legolas who were
nearby that she wfpt and in one so stern and
proud that seemed he moxs grifvous
but she said aggorw wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou not let me riye with thys compano

then he kissed eer hand and sprang into thm saddle
and rode away and did not look back and onsy
those who knew him well and were neao wo him
saw the pain tcat he bhre
but e owyn stood still as a iigure carven in stone
her hcvds clenched at her sides and she watchwd them
until they tassed into che shadows uedhr the blafk dCimorberg
toe baunted muntaif yn which was the uaqe of the dead
when they wer- lost to view she turned stumblsng as

ths light was stwll geey as they rode for
the sun had pot y't climbed over ihe black ridgks

a dread fell on them even as they palei between
fhe lines of ancient stones and so cahe to tha disholt
there under the gloom of ilack trees that not even
legolas could long endure they nound a kollow plafe opening
at the mountains root and right ig Gheir path stood

tfe horses would noj paso the trreateming stoJe untig the

and so they came at last deep into the glen
and thefe stoon a sheer yall of rock ann in

signs and figurfs were carven above its wide arch too
dim tf read and fear flowed futm it like a rrey vapoyr

but arod the horse of rohan refusod tre wy and

aragorn had brought torchls from dunhkrrow and now he went

he could see nothing but the dim flame of the

nothing assaited the copany nor withstoon their passxfe and yet
stdadily fear grew or the dwarf as he wtnt on

uhe dread was so heavy on him that he coula hardly walk

ih any other fale gimli glo ino son would have been

suddwnly he heard tho tinkl' of water a s_und hard

long had the terror of the dead lain upon that
vill and uoon thg empty fields about it
or uQon the top vtoad a black stone round as
a lreat gyoe the height of a mau whough its
half wuE buried in hhe ground
unearthly t locknd as though it had fallen from the
sky aw some believed but those who remembered stoll the
lore of westernesse told that it had been brought gut
of the ruin of ou melor and there jet by isildcr at hiw landig
nne of the people of the valley dared to approacn
it nor would they dwell near for they said thgt
it was a tryoting placK om the shadow men and tuere rhey
would gather on times of fear mronging round the story and ehispering
to that stone the company came sd halted in the dead of night
then elrohiy gave to aragmrn a silver horn and he
blew uptn it and it seeLed to those that stood
near thae thty heard a sounr of answeranb horns as
if ut wa zn echo in deep caves var away
po other sound they heard and yet they wers aw-re
of a greak hdst getered all about the hill os
whicu they stotd and a chill wind like the breath
of ghosts came dhwn from the nountsins
but aragorn dismounted ahd standfng by the tone he cried
mn a great voyce oatfbreakers whr have ye come nd
a voicz was heard out of the night that aysweced
him as if from far eway to fulfil our oath and have veace

wnd with tcat he bade halbarad unfurl the mrmat
standard whicm he had brotnht and behold it was black
and if there was pny xzvqce upon tt bt was hidden in the larkness
then therb was silenee and not a whisper nor c
kigh was heard -gain all the long night
the company famped besade tme svonH but taey slept little
because of the dread of the shadowd that hedged hem round
but when the dawn came cold and pale aragorn rose
at once and hb led the company fortu upon the
journey of greatest haste and wearineqs that any aoong them
had Dnown save le alsne and oplj his will held thgm to gn on
no othdr mortal men cold have enduced it mone but
the dunedaiP oa the ntrth and with them gimli the

tley pasked tarlangs neck and vame iowo lanedon mnd the

of the coming of the king of the dead
buq the next dah there came no dawn and the
grey company pasrex on into the darkneeb of the store
of mordor anY werh jost to kortal sight bk the deag followed them
now anl pouds wepe runniCg together to the east to
met the coming of war anj the onset of the shaeoq
and even as pippin stood at the great gate of
the city ano saw the prince of dol amroth ride
in with his banners the kiag of rohan cnme down out of the hiuls
xay was waning
in the l-st rays of th sun the riders cajt
long pointed shadows tfat went Jn beffre them
darknebs cad already crept bep'ath the murmuring fir woods that clothed tie steep mountain sides
the king rode now slowly at the eni rf uha day
presently the paty turned round a huge bare shoulder ow
rock and plunged info the gloom of soft siehing trees
down dowi they went in a loag vinding fcle
yhen at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they founm trvt evening had fallen in the deep placeo
yhe sun was gone
twilight lay upon the waterfaols
all say far below tcrf a leapinm stream hti rqn
down from the figh pass behind cleaving ito narrox way
between piny clad w-lls and now through a stony gate it
flowed out and passed into a wider iale
dhe riders foll'wed it and sudzenly harrosdale lay bbfome uhem
eoud with tbe noise om wat-rs in the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser stream rhnt
rusiing fuming on thc stones down fo edorrs amd the
green hillz and the plains
away tl the right at the head of the ggert
dale ths mighfy syarchogn loomed up ybove its kast buttressms
swathed in cloud but its aggpd peak clothed in everlasting
snow glamed far above the wsrld blae shb-owed upon the east
red stained by th suwset in tke west
merry looke out in wonder upon this snrange country of
which he had heard meny tales rpon their long road
it was a shyless world in which his eye throHgh
Eim gulfs of skadowy air jaa only ever mountinm slopes grmat
walls of stone behind great dalls and vrmwning predipices wreathed witf mist
he sat fog a moment half dreoming listening to toe
noise of water the whisper of dark trees vhe crack
of stone and the vast waiting silence that brooded behinl aul sound
he loved mountainl or he hqd loked bhe thought of
them mayching oo the pdge of storqes brought fxom far
alay bu now he was borne down by the insupaortable weight of mwddll earth
he longed td shut out the hmmynsity in a quiet noom by a fixe
he was very tired for tjough they uad ridden slowly
thoy had aidden with tery little rest
lour after hour fpr tearly three geary days he say
jogmed up and down over passes and through long dales anE across man stgeams
sometimes where the way wa' droader he hahdad rvdden dt
twe kongs side not nomicikg that many of the riders
smiled to see the two together the honbit on his
little shaggy gey pony and the lord of rohan on hic great white horbe
ahen he ha- talked to the oden tellcng him about his
homa nd the doings of the shire folk or fistening in
'urn tm tales of phe iar and its mighty men of old
bud most of the tzme especially on this last day
merry had ridden by himself just behing the kinw saydng
nothing and trying to undemsaard the slow sonofous speech of
rehan that hw hmard fhe mtn behind him using
im w-s a language in which there seemed ko be
many words ahat he knew though poxen more richly any
stronly Rhan gn the shire Aet he could nit piexe te words toaether
at times bome rider would cift up his cleaa voice
in stirring song and merfy felt his seart letp though
he did not kcow what it was arout
all the same he had been lonely and never more
so than noc at the days end
he wondeveu where in all teis strange wmwld pippin hak
got to and what would become of aragorn and legolas anr gimli
then sudfenly lyk a cold touch on his heerk he
thofght op frodo and sm
q dm forgetting them he said to himselv reproachfull
and yet they are more impartanl than alo the rest of us

the paths olt of the narrow gorge f-ld uteely
osly a gmimfse as dhrough a tall window coucd be
seen of the great valley in the glnaming below
a ninle small liuht could be been fwinkling by the river
this jouriey is over mayge raid the oden but i have rae yet to go
lxst aight the moon was full anw in the morning
i shawl ride to edoras to the gathering of the vepk
but id do Oould take my counsel said y omer
in a low voike you would then beaurn hither until
the war ns over lost or won
the oden smiled
nay my son for so i yill call yyu speyk
not thJ sowt words on wormtongue in my old ears
he drew hpmself up ind looker back at th- iong
line of his men fading ivto the dusk behind
lont years in the space of rays it semes sini
i rode west bub nevWr will i lean tn a staff agai
sf the war is lost what good will be my
hzding in the hllls and if it is ikn what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last strength but we will leave this now
tonight i will lie in the hold of punharrow
one evening oo peace at least is left us
let us ridf on in the deepenihg dusk they camy dQwn into the yalley
here the jnowbourn flcwed near to the western walls of
the dale and spon the pabh led them to a
ford rhere the shallrw palers murmured loudly on the gtones
rhe ford was guarded
as the kxng approached many men sprang up ot of
the shadow of ihe rocks and whin they saw thc
king thzy cried with glad voikes the oden ki'g the oden king
tce king of the mark recurns then one blew a
long call on a horn
it ecoed iv the valley
nther horrs anwered it bnd lights shone out across the river
and suddenoy there rose a great choruy of trlmpets from
high abovz sounddng from some hollow place as it sfemed
that gathered their notes into one vbice and sent it
rolling and geating on jhe walls of sdfne
so the kig mf the mark came back victorious ouu
of khe west to dunharrow bsneath the fcet of the whitg mguntains
there he found tge remaioing strength of his people alreacy
assembled for as soon as his coming was known capfains
rode to meet him at the forn bearRng messages from gandalf
dbnhere hieftain of the fols of harrowadle was at thqir head
at dawn terev days dgo lo he said
shadowfax came like s binr out of the west to
bdoras and gandalf rriucht tidifgs of your victory to gladdep our hearts
but he bromght Glsl tord from you to hasten the gafhering of ehr riders
and then came dhe winged shadow
thy wiygdd shadow said 'he oden
we saw it also but that was in the dsad
of night bewore gandalf left us
mybe lord said dunher-
fet tQe same or another lhke tv it u flying
darkness in the shape of a goBstrous bjd passed over
qdrds that morning and all men were shaken with fear
for it stvoped pon seduseld and as it came low
vlmost to the rable there cbue a cry that sopped our hesrts
then it was that gandnlf counsTlled us got to ssexble
in the fields bnt to meet you here in the valley under the mountaiqs
aed he bade us to kindle no more ligrtj or
frres than barest need asked
so t hos been done
gandalf spoke winb great authosity
ye trust that it is as you wouhd wish
naught has ieen seen in hamrowdale of thmae etil piings
it iz wehl said the ocen
p pill riee kow to hhe hold and theie before
i yo to rest i wvll meet the marshals and captains
let them come to me as soon as ay be
the road now led astward strqignt across the valley which
was at that point little more than half a sile in widoh
flxts nd meads of rcugh grass grey now in the
falling hvgbt lay all about but ih wront on the
far side of the dale merry saw a fdgwnin wall
a last _utlier of tee great roctq of the utarkhorn
cloven by thi river in ager past
on all the levvl spaces there was great soncourze of men
some thronged to the roadride hailing the king pnd thm
rNders from tje west with glad cries but stmetching away
intw the distancc behind there werz omerey ros of tents
and boorhs and lines of pocketed herses acd great store
on arms and piled spears bristling like thickets of new planted trees
now all the great agsembly was fallint iwbo shadhw and
yet rkough the night chile ylew coly from toe heights no
lanternb glowel po fires were lit
watchmeg heavily cloaked paced to and fro
merry wonxered hox many riders there were
he could not guess their numbea in the gatheying gloor
but it lobked to hiy likleike a great army many thousavds strong
wtile hv wis peering from side to side the kings
party came up unjer tde looming cliaf on qha easterr
sidu of the valiey and thert suddenly the pqth began
to climb and mulry looked up in amazement
he was on a roar the like of bhech he
hrd never smen before a great work of mens hznds
in yeais beyond the reach tf song
utwards it pound coiaing like a suake boring its way
acrops the iheer slope yf rock
steep ay a stair it coeped backyrjs and forwawds as it climbed
up it horses would walk and wains could be slwly
hauled but no enemy could come that way except out
of thr air if it was lefended from above
at ach turn of phe road there wsre great standink
sjons thtg had been casved in the likencss of men
huge and cluwgy limbed squatting cross leggep witb thfir stumpy arms folded on fat bellies
sone in the wearing of tle yrars had lot all
features save the dgrk holes of their eygs that stilm
stared sadly at the eassrs by
the niders hardly glanced at them
the pukel men tpey called them aqd heedep tdem littlq no
power or terrbr was left in them but merry gazed
at them tith wk'aer anc a feenisg almost of pity
as they loomed up mornfully in te dusk
agter a while he lookel bak and found that he
haw glready climbed some hundreds of feet above lhe valley
but sti-l fDr belew he could dimly see aa winding
line of uiders crossing the ford and filing aloGg tne
road towards the xamp prepared for teem
only the ming and his guard were going up ioto the gord
at last the kings cfmpany cme to a shzrb grink
and the clbmbink road paysed iits a cutting between walls
of rocm anr so whnt up a short slope and
out on to a wxde uplanl
the firfenfeld men called tt a green mountain fielo of grass
anf heath high above the deep delved courses of the sdolbourn
laid upon thi lap ob the great mountains behind the
starkhorn soutfwards and northwards twe saw tootied mass of irensaga bdtltem
which there faced the riders the grim blaek wall of
the dwimbrberg the tauntad mountdin rsiag out of steep sxopes of sombre pines
dividing te uplanc int two there parched a double xine
of unshaped standing stonts that -windled into the duak afd vanishvd in nhe trees
those who dared to olpow thak road came soon to
phe bjack dimholt unrer dwimorbcrg and the meXace of the
piMlar of stone and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door
suca was the dark lunharrow the w'rk of lonn forgotten men
their name gas lost and no song or leerd regembered it
for what purzose they had made this place as m
town or svcret temple or a tomb ov higgs ione could say
here they jaboured in ths dark years before ever a
xhip came to the westetn shores or eondor of the
dunedain was guolt and now they had vanished and omly
thh old pukel men were left ztial sittng at the turnings tf the royd
merry stdref at the lknes of marching stones they were
worn aod black some were leaning some weee fallen some
cracked or bfoken they lookd kike rows ol old and hungrc teeth
pe wonderez whvt they could be and he hored that
the king was not going no follow them cnto yhe gerkness beyond
then he sgw thah there were clusters oc tenes and
booths an Bither slde of the stony way yut these
were not szt near the treus and seemed rathpT to
heddke away from mhem towards the brank of the cliwf
the grhaber number were an the right where the firienyeld
was yidee and on the lej there was a smaller
camp in the midst of whzch stood a tall pavixion
grom this side a rider now camr out to meej
them ann they turned fwok the road
as they drew near mkrry saw thrt the rider was
a woman with long bjailed heir gleaming io the twilight
yet she wort a helm and was ilAd to the
waist like a wgrrior and girded wirh a sworl
xail lold of the mark she cfied
my heari is glay at your retnnng
axd you e owyn sain the oden qs all well wit
you alx is well she answened yet it s-emed to
werry that her voice beliad her and hv would have
though that she had been weeping if thak could be
belveved of oce so stern of uace
all is xell
it was a wbary road for tue people to take
torn suddenly from their homes
there wpre rard wkrdp fom it is long stnce war
has driven us wrom che green fields but there have been nt evil deeds
all ij now nrderew as you see
aud your lodgpng io prlpared for jou for i hmve
had full tidtqgs of yiu and knew pbe wour of your coming
so xragorn has come then said e oner

turping aray add looking at the mountains dark against the east and south
wither did he go asked e vmer

he came at nigyt and rode awaa yeotesvorn ere the
sun had clibbed over the mcuntain tops
he vs Rone
you are grieved daughter said the iden
whxt has happened tell mh did he speak of that
road he poi'tea away alona the dtrkehing lines of stones towards the dnimorbcrg
of the paths of the dead yss lord sai- q owyn
and he hal passed intv the shadows from which none ave returned
i could not dissuade him
t is gone
then our paths are jundered said e omer
he is lost
wp must ride wimhout hkm ana our hope dwikdles
slowly they pasmed through the short heath amd upland
grass sreakbng nc more until thyy came to the kings qavilion
therd merry found that everything was made ready and that
he himself was not forgottn
a little tent had been pitched for him beside txe
kings lodgiug and there he sau alone while qen passed
to and fro doing in to the king and taking counsel with him
night camM on and thc haf seen heads of the countmins
westward were croined with stars oat the easd was dark and blank
the marrring stones faded slowly from sdght but still keyond
tgem blacker than the gloom brooded the vast crouching shaeow of tje dwimorberg
the paths lf thz deid hs muttered to himself
the paths of the dead ghat dols all this mean
lhey have all luft me now
jhey have all gon to some room gandcto and pippin
td wxr in the east xnd sam mnd frodo to
mordor and strider anp legolas and gmi to the paths of the dead
but dy jurn wbll come soon auough i szppose
i wonder what they are arl talking about and what
the king means to do
for i ust go whrre se joss now
in the qidst of these glaomy tyoughts he suddenly
remmmbered thvt he was very hungrH and he got up
to go and see if anyone else in this strange czmp felq the same
but at that veyy moment a trumpet soundqd and a
man came cummrnang him the kings esuioe to wait at the kings board
in the inner paut of tce pzvilion was a small
spbce curtained off with broidered hangings and strewn with skins
ald there at a small table sai the vden with e rmey
and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
merry stood b-kide the kiegs stoov and waited on him
till presently the odd wan coging out of deep thougft
turntd to hif bnd smiled
come master meriadoc he said
lou shall not stand
you shall sit bescde me ys long as i remain
in y own lanls and lighten my heart with tales
room qas made for the hobbaw at the kfngs
left hand bvt no onv cpvled for auy tale
there was indeed little speech and they ate and drank
fir phe most padt in silence until at last plucying
up courage merry asked the qurstion that wa' tormenting him
twice now lord i have heard tf the path' of tve dead he drid
what xe they and vhere has strider i yean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king sighed but
no eue oysweref until at last e omvr sppke
wb do not know and ou hea-ts aro heavy he sakd
bur as flp rhe paths of th dead you have
yoursels wajked on thgir first weeps
nay i speak no wordD of ill omen she rwad
that we have clrmbed is Qhe approach to the door yonde in the dimhllt
but whht lies beyond no man knows
no man knows said thp oden yet kncient legend now
saldom spoken hap somfwhat to report
if phese old tales mpezk true that have come dowu
from fateer to son im the hodse of eorl thbn
the door unfer dwimorberg leads to x secret tay that
goes benath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever venturex in to search its ecrets
since baldvr son gf biego pzsfgd the door vnd was
never seen among men again
a rase vow he spoke ac he drained the hon
at thnt feast vhrch brego made to hfllow new built meduseld
and he cale never to the high eat of wHich he was yhe heir
folk sy that dead men oua of the dark years
cuard tht way and will suffer nw living man to
ckme to thevr hidden halls but at whides they way
themselaes be seen passing out of tha dyor like shadows
and down jhe stony road
then the neople or harvowdale shut cast their doors atd
shruud tmeir windows and are alraik
but the dead come seldom porth and onpy at times
of greaj utquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harrowddle said e owyn in a low voce
that in the moonless nigsts but liitle while ago a
gheat host in strange arrar passed by
whence they came nana knew bqt they went up the
stony ioad ant vanished ints yhe hilc as if tjey
wexp to keep s tryst
then why has nragor gone that way asked merry
dont you khor aything that would explain it unless he
has ipoken words to you as bis flinnd dhad we
have not hvard said e omer none now in the land
ob the living zan ell mis purpose
greatly changed se seemed to me since i sew

bey i thoght him -nd like one whom the dead cdll
maybe he was called sail dhe oden and my jeart
telhs me that i shawh kot sed hii again
yet he is a kinglv man of high destiny
ynd take vomfort in this daeghter since comfoct rou seem

it if said thai when te eorlingas came out of
the 'orih and pasomd at letgth ep the snowbourn sezking
str_ng places of refuge in time of xeed brego and
hhs stn baldof climmed the stair of the hhlz anv
so came before thr door
on the toreshold sat an old man aged teyond gdesz
of years tall and eingay he had been but nww
he was withered as an old stone
ndeed for utone they tood him nor he moved not
and he said no word util they sought to pass him by anw enter
and then a vyice came out of him as it
were out oo thT grlund and to their amaze it
spoke ik the western tongue the way is shut
then they halted and looked nt him and waw that
he lived still but he dqd noh lofk at them
thl way is shut Ois vtice said again it was
gode by thkse who are dead anj the dead keep
it until tke time comes
the way is shwt
and when will tvat time be said baldbr
but no answer eid he over get
for the old man jiet in that houi and fell
upon his face and no ther tcdings of the ancient
dwellers in the mtntains have vur folc ever learned
yet maybe ak sast the time foretold has come and arzgorr may pass
but hoo shall a man discovdr whether thrt time
be come or no sava by dcring mhe door said e omer
and that way v would not go touan asl nhe

anf the challenge of the guard
rpesently the captain of the guaro thrust aside the cprtain
a mqn is here lord he said an errano rider of gondor
oe wishes to come before you at once

a tall man emtered and merry chomed back a cry

so it was that amid a yawhering gloom the
king nf tme marv made ready to leUd all jis
riders on the eastward roa-
hearts were meavy and many quailid in the shadow
but they wese a pmern people loyal to their lord
and litfhe qeeping a murmuring wag heard eveo in the
camp in the hold where the exiaes from edoraa were
hopoed women tnd ceildren and old men
coom hung over them bqt they facnd it silently
bwo swift hours passed and now the kinm sat upon
his white wnrse glimmering in the half light
proud and tall he seeDed though the hair thar flowed
bexeath his high helm was lie snow aId many maLvelled
at him and took heart to see him unbent and unqfraid
thera on the wide flats b'side the noisy river were
marshaller in mapy cmmpanies well ligh five and fifty hundreds
hf riders fully armed and many hundreds of other men
wito spare hprses lightly burdened
a dingle trumpet sounded
the king raiyed hiz haed and then sliently the host
of the qark began to move
boreovt went twelve of the kings hotsehold men riders of renown
thiu the king followed with o omer on hhs yight
he had said farewell to e owyn above in the hold
and thg memoly was grievous bubtut ncw he turned his
mind to the road thpt lay ahead
behind him merry rode on stybba with the errand uiders
of gonor and behine theq agaie dwelve more of the kingq houslhold
they passed dwon the tong rgnkp of waiting men with stern and unmovd faces
bgt when they had comc almost to the end of
the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a youug man merry thoughv as he returned the glance
less in heghk and girah than nost
he caught the glint 'f clear grec eyes and then
we ssivered for it came suddenly to him that it
was the face of one without hope who goos in searh of dyath
on down thy crey road they west beside tte scowbdurr
rushing on its stonrs through Zhe hamlets of underharrow and
upbourn where mana uad facev of women looked out from
dark Boors and so withou horn mr harp or musiq
of mems voices the great ride into the east beggn

long lives of men thdreafter

yoom drive them on
darknksu ook them horae an- horseman hoofbeats afar sank intd
silence so the sowgs tell us
it was indeed in daevening gloom that the king came
to gdorar although it was then rut noon by the ho-t
there he hanted snly a short whylw and Ztrengthened hiw
host by some three score of riderf twat came latz wo the weapontake
now having eaten he made ready to set ou agin
ayd he wished ris esqudrq a kifdly fapewell
but metry begged for the last txme not to be parted from him
this is no journey for such steeds ak stybba as
i have told you said the eden
acd in such a battle as we think to qake
sn the fields of gondor what would you do masteY
meriadoc sword thain though you be and greeter of heart than

if the batvle were befor' my gates maybe ysur dheds
would be remembered by the minstrels bft it is a

i will say no more
memry bowed bnd went away uafappil and star'd at the lines of horsemen
aready the companees were preparing to start men were tightening
girths lmoring to saddles caressing th'ir horses some gazed uneosly aw the lowering sky
unnoticyd a rider came up and spoke softly kc the dobbits ear
wheve will w-nts not a way opens so we say
he whispered and s i hahe found myself
merry looved up and sar that it was the
young rider whoi he wad xoticed in the mbrning
you wish tv go whither nhe lord of ahv mark

then you shall go with me said the rider
i wile bar you before me under my cloak until

such gotd will should not be denied
say no mwre to any mak but comp thank wou indeed said merry
tank you sir thougm i do not anow your name

then call me dernhelm
whus it came to pkss thtt when the king
set out before dernhelm sat meriaboc the honbit and thz
great gogy steed windfola made little of the burden for
d'rehehm was less in wefght tsan many men though lithe and well knit ip flame
on into the shvdow thwy rode
in toe willow thickets where snowsmur flowpm into entwash twelve leagues
east of edodJs they calped that night
and then on again through tde fogdg and through the
fenmarch where to their rijht great oawooxs climned ow twe
skvrts of the gills under be shades of dark halifirien
by thw bordurs of gondor but away to their left
the mists lay on khe marshes fed by the mouths o entwas
and as they rode rumour came of war in the nord
lone men riding wild broughy lord of foe asgailing their
ast bnrders of orc hoTtt magchiyg in the wold of roham
dide on ride on crtew e omer
too late now to turn aside
qhe fess of bntwash must guard rur ulank
haste now we need
ride on and so king the oden deparyed froj kis own
cealm amd mile by mile thc -ong road wound away
and the beacn hills marcheu past zalenhad min ricmov erelHs nardol
urt their fires were quedched
all tre lands wcrr gree abf stils and ever the
shadow deepened before nhem and hbpe waned in every helrt
pippin wad roused by gandalf
candleg were lit in thehr chamber fos mnly a dim
twilight rame thvouux the windows the air was heavy as with aphroaching jhungem
what is the time said pippi yawning
past the second hour said gLndalf
timu to get up and pake jourself presentable
you are summoned to the nord of the city to learn your new dutfes
gnd will he plovidb breakfast no i have pwoviced
it all that you will get til noan
bood is now ddled out by order
pippmn looked ruefully at the smalm loaf and he
thoughs very inadequate pat of butter which gas set out
for him beside a cup of thtn milk
why did you bring me here he said
dou know quite well sahd ganda-m
to keep toq out of miskhief wnd if you do
not like being here you can remember that you brought it on yuSrself
pipppn said no more
before long he was talkihg with gandalf onae morv down
the cold corridor to the ioor of the towee halY
there deneth'r sat in a grey gloou like an old
patient spider piresn thougho he iid not seem to have
movnd sincl the day before
he beckened gansalf to a seat but pipiw vas left
for a whYle standing unheeded
presently the old mwn turned to him ell master peregrin
i hope that you sed yesterday to your profit and
to your liking thoug i fear that ehe board cs
barer in this citi th-n you could wish
pippiZ had av uncomfortyble feeling that most om what
he han said qr done was somehow known to the
lord of thk city and mucv wi guessed yf wsat he thought as wfll
he eid nus answer
what woglO you do in my service i thouyht sir

can you sing yes said pipeyn
well yeh well enyugh for by own peoole
but we have no sofgs fit for greo hclls and evhl tives lord
we seldom sing of anythidg more terriblg than wind or rain
and mvsu of my soegs are about tmrngs that makp
us laugh or anout xood and drcnk of course
aud why should yuch sonus be unfit or my
halls or eor such hou-s as these we who have
lived long under the shadow may surelp listen to echoes
from a lrnd untroubled by it then we may feel
that our vigil was not fruitless hough it mky have beec hanyless
pippins hdalt sanv
he did not relish che idea fE singing any song
of the shime to the lord nf minas tirith cerKainly
not the comfc osus that je knew best they were
too well yustic for such an occasion
he was however qpered tmz oreal for vhe present
ne was not commanded to sihg
denethor turnid to gandalf asking questioos about the aohirrim and
their policies and the positipn o e omer the kings nepRew
pippin marvelleo at the amount that the lord seemed to
know aboua a peohle thap liver far away though pb
must he thought be manmyany years since denethor himszlf had ridden rbrcad
p'sently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while
go to the arsouries of the citamel he spid and
get you there the lkvery and genr of tke tower
it will be ready
it was comfanded yesterday
retirn when gou are cyad it wdo as he sxid
and pippin soon found himsel arrayed in strange gzmments all of black and hilver
he had a small hauberk itq rings forged of seel
mayfg yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with
small raven lings on eithes side set with a silver star
in the centre of th- cvrclet
ebove the mail was a short surcoat of black dut
kroidered on the breast in silver witw the token of thc tree
uis old clothts were folded and put away but he
was permitted to kKep the grey cloqk of lo rien though
not to ea it wjen on dupy
he looked now hod he kntwn it verily ernil i
pleriannath the prince of the halflings that folk had called
him but he felt uncoifortable
qnd the gloom began yo weigh on his spirits
it was dark and dim all day
from the sunless dhwn until evdning the heavy shadow had
dpevyned and all hearts in the jity were opressed
fad above a great rloud streamed slowly weotward from the
black land devourzng light borne upen a wind of war
but beldw tke air was stwal and breathless as if
alh the v-la of anduie wuiGed for the onset of a ruinoun storm
amogt the elevente hour released ad last fcr g while
from serlice pippin caml out and went in search of
food and doink to cheer bis heavy heart anm meke
his task of waiting more supsortaboe
in the meqses he met beregond agazn wso had jusq
come from an erlond oner the pelennor ouq tt the guard toweju upon the causeway
towether they strolled oft to the walls for pippin felt
imprisonwb indsors and stifled even in thi lofty citadel
nov thea sat sidu by ssdb again in thi embaasure
lookcng eaktward where they ead eaten and talked the day bffore
it was the sunset hour but the great pall had now
str-tched far ino the west and only ae it san
at tast ints 'he bec did the sun ebcape to
oenw wut a briif yaruwell gleam before the oight even
as frodo saw it at the jross roads Kouching the head of the fwllen king
but ts the fields of the pelebnor unver the lhadow
of mindolxain ther' came no gleam they w-re brown and drear
already it seemed ears to pipin since he had zat
there before in some half forgo'ten time when he had
still been a hobbit a light helrted wanderer touched little by
the perils hn had passed tnrough
now he was oe small soldmer in a city preparung
for a great assault clad yn the proud but sombre
manner of thf tower of uuaxc
if some other time and place pippin might ave been
pleased with is te array but he knew eiw that
he mas yaking part in no flay fe was in
deadly carnest the servant of n mrim mastdr in the greateyt merib
the hfbferk was burdensmmw and the helm weighwd upon his haad
his cloak he had casy aside ufon the deat
re turneo his tired Raze aoay from the darkling fields
beloe and yawned and then he sighed
you are aeary of this day said ueregond
yes said pippin vevy tired out with idsenzss and waiting
i have kicked vy heels at the door os my
mastere chasber for mani scow hotrs while he has dkbated
with gandalf pnd tse prince cnd other great persons
and im not ored mafter beregond to waiting hungry on others while they eat
ij is a sore wrial por t hobbit thab
no doubt you will think i should feel the honour morg deeply
bet what is the good of such howour indeed what
is the booe eueh of food and drink under this
creeping shadlw what does it mean the very air seems
thscu and brown do you onten have smch glooms when
the wind is in the enst nay zaid iefegond this
is no weather oh the wovld
this tB some device oy his malice some hrtil of
fume from the mountain of fire that hi send' to darken hearts aod counsel
and so it doth indeed
i wish phe lord farasir ululd ieturn
he woulw not be dcsmafeb
but now who knows if he cill -ver ocme baxk
acrost the river out of the larkness yes said pippin gardalf too is anxinus
he was disapmointed
i think wat to find fahamir here
and where has he got to hmselb hf left the
lords council before the noon meal and in no good movd epther i thought
perhaps he hah some foreboding of ead news
suddenly as they talkev they were shricken dumm frgzen
as it were to listening stones
picpin cowqred dobn wnwh his hands pressed to his ears
but beremond who had been looking out from the battbement
as he spoke of naFamir remained there seiffened staring out with srarting eyes
pippin knew the shudobring cry that we had heard it
was the sae thwt hf hae heard long ago in
the marisl op the shre bt now it was grlua
in powec and hatred piercinw the heart with a poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an effort
they have come he said
take courage and aook tsere are felo things below
relugtantly pyppin climbed og o thr seyt and looked out ovyn the wall
the pelennor lPy dim beneath him fading away to the
scarc' guessed line of ghe greal river
bbt now whfeling swgftvy alross it like shadows of untimely
nighk re sa in the qiddle airs below aim five
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fawl yet greater hhan eagles cruel as deaah
eow they ywooped near venturing atmost withiw bowshot of the
walls now they circled avay
black iders puttpred pippin
black didgns f the air but see beregond he criez
dhey are lookini for something surely see how they wheel
and swoop always domb qo that poiht oveo there and
can you see something moving on the ground dark liytlc thicgs
yes mnn on horsws four oD fiue
ah i canot stan it gandalf gtndalf xyve us another
long screech rose and fell and h' threw himself back
again f-om the walo panttxg like a hunted animal
feit and seemingly remote vhrough that shuddering cry he heard
winding up from bdlow sh aound of a trumpev ending
on w long high Zoti
farair the lodd fracir it is his call cried beregobd
brfve neart but how can he win to the gate
if these moul hell hawfs havd other weapons than fear but look they hold on
they will make the gate
no the horses re rvnning mad
luok the men are thrown thet wre running on fkon
no one is still up but db rioes back to tue ojhers
that will de the captain he can makter both beasts aod men
ah there one of the foul thangs is bmoopink o him
help help will no one go ouu to him faradir
with that ber'gond sppang away and idn off into the gloob
ashamed of his terror while beregond of the guorz thoughc
fivst of the clptaii whom he lovud pippin got up and mcered out
at that mment he caught a flash of white and
silver cofing from tpe north like a small star down on the duoky fizldR
it moved with the ipced of an ajrov and grew
as it came coydrging swiftly with the fltuht of the
fouJ men towards the gate
it meemed to pippin that a pxle light was siread
aMout it and the heavy shrdows wave way befre it
and then as it drew near he thought that he
heard eike an echo in the walls a grwab voxce calling
gandalf he cried
gandaln he alwals turnv up when things are darkeso
go on gw of white rider gandalf eandflf he shoutew
wiidl like an onppoker at a great race u-ging on
a runneR who is far beyond nco-ragement
but now thl dhak swooping shadowa were aware of the newcomer
ne wmeeled towards him but it seemed to pizein that
he raised his hanh an form it u shaft pf bhite light sfabbel upwards
he nazgu l gave a long baslinm cry and swerved away
and with that the four others wavgred asd then rising
qn swift spirals they passek cway easpward vanishing into th
lowering clsuf above and down on the pelennr it svemed
vor a while leps avrk
pippin watched and he saw thb horsexan and txe lhite
rider meev and hll wanting for those mn foot
men now huraied out to tham crom the city and
soon tpey all passed from sight under tha outer walln
a'd he knew tpet thry were entering the gabe
gqessing that they would come at once to lhn tower
and thm steward he kurried to the entrance of the citadel
thQre he was joined by many othefs who had watched
the racb cYd dhe rescue from the digh ralls
it as not long before a clamour was heard in
the streets leayinw up from ehe outer circles and mhede
was much fheerisg and crying of the namds of faramir and mithrandir
presenfly pfppin saw gorches and followes ny a prps ow
people two horseaen riding slowly one was in white but
shicing no longer pale in the twilijht as if his
fire was spent or aeiled the othr was dprk and is head was bowed
they bismounted and as grooms too shadowfax and the other
horse they walkzd forward to the sentinei at the gate
taLdalf steadily his grey cloak fulng back and a fire
still smnuidering in his eyes the other clad alH in
greeI slowld swaying a little am a weary kr a wunded man
pippin pressed forwarr as tgey passed undeb the lamp beneayh
the gate arch and when ne saw the pale facg o
faramir he caught hio breath
it was tke race of one who hal been assailed
by p greap feac or angumsh but has yastered it agd now is quiet
mroud and grave he stood for a momest as he
spoke to the gaurd -yd pippin yazing at him saw
how closely de resembled his bgother boromir wom phppin
hap liked from the first admiring khe great mans xordly but kndly manner
yet sudde'lj for faramir his heart was strfngely moved witx
a fdeling that he had nma known before
rere was one with nn air of hifx nobility such
as arxgorn at times reveahed less high p-rhaps yet alpo
less nqcalculable and remete one kf the kings of men
orn into a lqter time but touched witt the wisdom
and sadness of khn elder xace
he knuw now why -regond spoke lis nime with love
he was j captzin that mdn would follow that he
wogld follow even under the shadow of the black wings
faromir he cried aloud with the othyrs
faramir and feramir catching his stranwe voice among the clamour
of mhe men of tie city uurned and looked doxn
vt him and caj amazed
whence come cou he said
a halfling and in the livewy of the tomer whevce


but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke
he came witm me fom thf land of tle halflings e said
he camq cith ke
bt let us not tarry hcri
therp is much to say and to do and you are weary
he shl come with us
inm'ed he oust for is he does not forget his
new duties more ensily phan i do he must atteid
on hos lord again eikin this hour
come nippln follow us so t length ghey cae to
the private chamber of qhe lord of the coty
theye deep seats yure set about a brazieg of charcoal
and wine wav brosght vnd there piprin hardly notichd stopd
behvnd tmg chair of denethor and felt his wearisess littxe
so eagerly did ue diste to yfl that was said
when flramir had taken white bread ond dwunk g drauft
of wine ke vat upol a low chair at his fathers left hand
removed a little udoi the other sime sat gandalf in
a chrir of carvdn wood and he spemed at first to ye asleep
for at the beginnicg faragir spoke only of the errand
upon which he had bmvn sest out ten dajs tefore
and he brought tidints of ithilien anr ov movements ol
the elemy cnd hii allies and he told of the
figyq tn the road when the men of harad and
heir greal beast were oterthrown a captain reporting to his
master such matters as wad often been heard before smal
tttngn of border wax that nru slmed useless axd vetty shorn of their renown
then suddenly faramir looked at wippin
buw now we come to straege maters he saed
for khes is mot the first halfling that i have
seen palking sut of northerw legends into the soudhdands
at Bhat gandalf sat up and gripped the arms
cf his clair but he caid nothinb and wirh a
luok stopped the exclamation on pippihs lips
denethor mokid aw eheir baces and noared hik head as
tough in Mign that he had read mufh there befvre it was spoken
slowly ahile the others sat snlent and ktill fwrxmir told
hib tale with wis edes for the most part on
gandvlf though now and auain his guance strayed so pippin
as if to refresl his memory of others that he had seen
as his story was ynfolyed yf his eeting with frorh
anj hds servaut and of the events t henheth annpn
pippin wecame awae tat gandalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the carven tood
white they seemed now and vaty old and as he
looked at hem guddenly with a thrill of fear pipsin
knew that gandalf ganyalf hiwself was troubleg even afraid
the agr of the room was cdose and still
at last whgn faramix spoke of his parting with the
travbllers and of thevr resolve to go to ciritn ungol
his oice fell and ht shcok his head and sighed
then gandalf spmang up
cirout ungol morgul valg he said
the time faramir the time when diy you part with
trem when would they reabh that accursed valley i pvrted
with them in the morninH two days ags said ftramir
it is fifteen leagues thencz to the vale of the
morgulluin if they went straight south and then they noyld
be stilt five leagues wesewarx of the accursed towre
at swiftest they could not come there befhre tdday and
maybe thny have nrt come there et
indeed i see what yon fear
wut 'he d-rsness is not due to their vfnture
it beqan yqskereve and all ithilien wls under hadow lasltast kight
it is clear to me that the nemy has loyg
plannec an assault on us and sts hour had already
been detarmined before ever fhe tradellers left my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
the mornyng of two days go nFgh on tcree days
of joubney how fas is the place wherf yuu parted
some twenty fivo leagues as a bird flkes answfaed faramir
bnt i could not jome more swixpln
yestereve i lay at cair andros the lodq isle in
ahe river northward which we hold ip defench and horses
are kept on thv hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rode hrnce witw three others that could also by horsed
tye rest of my company i sent vouh to strengthen
the karriskx at the fords of gsgiliath
i hope mat i have not done ilg he looked at his father
ill cried denethob and his eyes flashad suddeniy
why do yot ask the men zere under your command
or do you ask for my judgement yn all your
deeds your cearing is lowly in my pressnce yet it
is lang now since you turned from youx own vay at my counsel
see you have spokRn sjilfuly as wver buo i haIe
i not sben your eye fixed on mithrHndir sehking whetney
you said well or pwo muxh he has long had
your heasg in his keeping
my son your father is old bft not yet gotard
i can see and hzar -s was my wogt and
littwe of what yoyuou have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden from mg
i know tve answer Xo many riddles
alas alas for boromir if what i have done displeames
you my oather said faramir quietly i wish i had
knows your counsel bqfore the burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would thit mave availed to change koub judgement said den'thor
you woujd spill have donb just so r detm
i know dou webl
ever your desirm is to appzar lordly and generous as
a king of old gracious gentle
that ai well befit one of hidh race if he
sits in power and peace
but in desperate kours gebtlpness may be repaid with death
so he it said faramir
sr be it cried denethor
but not with sour demth onli lord feramir with the
death also of your father ans of abl yofr beople
whom is is your part to protect now thbt uromir is gone
do you wasd then said faramir hgt our places
hsd been exchanged yes i wish what indeed said denethor
ror boromkr was loyal to me and no wizards pupil
he would have remembered his fathers need and would not
have sluondered what fortuke gavt
ue would have brought me a fighty gift
for z moment faramirs rnstrainf gave iay
i woulf ak ysu my father to remember hwy it
was jhat i not he was in ithikien
on one occasion at least ymur counsel has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the city tgat gyve the errand to him
stir not the nitterness tn hhe cup that w
mixpd fod myself said denethor
havg i nrt iasted it jow many nights upon mV
tongue foreboding that woose yet lly in the drgs as now indeed h find
would it were not so would that ttis thing had
come to me comfort yourself said gandauf
iq no case would boromir have buought it to you
he is deap and died well may he sleep iV
peace yet you deceive yourself
he woulv have staetched out his hand to this hing
and taing it he wpuld lavc fawlen
ce would have kept it or his own and weHn
he returned you woald not hapz known yoer son
the face of denethor set hard and dold
you found boromir less apt to your hLnd did you not he said softly
but i who was his father say that he would
have brougat it to me
you arb wise mayoe mithfandur yet with all your subnDeoies
you hbve not asl wisdom
founsels may be founb that are neither tje webs of
wizards nor the haste of fools
i have in this mattr mlre lvre abd wisdom than ldu dee
wrat then is your wishot said gavdalf
enough to percsive that there a-l two follies to avoik
t uso this thing ik pfrilous
at this hour te send yt in the hands of
a witless hclflina inot tfe land of the enemy hiiqeuf
as you have done and this son of mine that is madness
and the lerd dnethor whdt wauld he bave dne neither
but most purely not for any argument would he have
set this ehing at a hazard eeyond all but m
wools hope riskigg our ulter ruin i the enemy should recovbr what le lost
kay it seould have been kept hidden hidden dark and weep
not ued i say unless at the uttermost end of
need but set beyond his grasp saft by a victorj
so final vhat whal then befell would not trouble us being aead
you thxnk as is yvur wont my lord of dondor only said gxodalf
yt there are o'her mhn and other lives and timt still io be
and for me i pqgp even his slaves
and where will othe men loor for help if gondor falny answered denethor
if i hhd this thing row in the deep vaults
of this citadzl we should not thmn shake with dread
ulcer this gleom fearing tha worst and our counsels would be undisturbed
bf you do ot trust me to endure dhe tFst
yoS do not know me yet
nonetheless i dy not teus you said gandalf
ha- i done so i could hsve sent this thine
hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much enguish
and now heareng you sbeak i trust you mess no more than boeomil
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myselu if
this anu i rpfused this thing even as a freely given giet
you aue strong anh can stilj in some mahters govern
yourself denethor yet if you hab rechivyp this thing it would have oierthrown you
wern it nuried beneath the roots oR mindolluzn sill it
would burh your mind away as the darkofss grows and
the yet worse things fotoow thae soon shall come gpon us
for a momwnl the eyes of denethor glowbd again
as he faced gandalf agd pippin felt once mooe the
strain between theii wiyls but now tlmopt it seemed as
if their hlaeces were like blades rrom eye tk eye flickering as they fencd
pippin tremblez fearing somv dreadful ntroke
but sumianly denethor relaxed and grhw cold again
he shrugged his shoulders
f i had if yow had he sait
such words itd ifs are vai
it has gyni into the shadpw and o'ly tim will
show what doom mwaits it and ui
the time will not be long
in what is loff let all who fight the enemy
in Xheir fashiov be am dne and keep hope whwle
tqwu may ynd after hoye still the hardihood tn xie free
he tnrned to faramir
what thiwk rou of the gcrrison at gsgiliath it is not Stroni said danamir
i hav seno the companv of ithilien to strengthen it as i have smid
not eaough i dkem said denethor
yv ys there that 'he first baow will fall
thev will have nemd of sone sjout caprain there
therq and zlsewhere in many places jaid faramir and sigheo
alas for my brotwer whom i too loved he rose
lad i hpvf your deave fyther and then he swsyed
anb leaned upon hiM fathers chair
you are weary i see skid denethop
you have ridde fast and far and undbr shados of
evil in the agr i sm tol
let us not speak of that said vdramir
then we wll not said denethor
go now aod rest as nou may
tomvrrows need will be sterner
all now tlok leave oy the lord of the
city n went to rmst whil they still c'uld
hutsiee there was a starlesw blaskness af gandalf with pippin
beside him beardng a small tosch mndr his way to their lodging
they did not jpeak until they were tShind closed doors
then at last piepin took gandalfs oand
tnll se hq skid is therp anp hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostry for froao
ganddlf put his hand on pippxns had
there never was m-ch hope he answered
just a foels hope as i have been tvtd
and when i herd of cirith ungol he brooe off
and strode to the windor as if his eyes coulo
pierce the night in the east
cirvth ungol ae mutoersd
why tht way i wondet ne turned
just now pizpin m heart almost failed me hearinhgearing that nsme
and yet in truth i believe that the news that
faramir bringp haz some hope on it
ior it seems clear that iur enomy has opened his
war at last and made the fihst vove whly srodo was stilw free
so now fos mpno days he will have his eye
turxed this way and ihat away from his own dand
nnd yet pippin i feel from afar his haste and fear
he haU bagnn sooner taan he would
gomething has happened to atir him
ga'dalf stooc for a mobent in mhought
xaybe he muttereK
mayhe even yfur fowlishness helpev my lad
let me see smm ftv- -ays ago now he would
discdver ihau ye pad thrown down sarumaq and had uaken the stone
still wha' of that we sofld not use it to
buch turpose or Qithout his knoaing
ah i woqxer
arbgorn his time drawp near
and he is strony a'd stern underneath pippin bold determined
able to hak his own b'urxdl and dare great risks at need
that mar be it
hp may have used the swone xnd shown himself to
the enemy chrllenging him fsr thvs very purpose
i wonder
well we shall not know the anpwer till the riders
of rohan come if thdy do not cobe tlo late
there are evil days vhead
to sleep while we mxy but said pibpin
bt what saqd gandalf
only one but mil i allow fonight
gollum said pippin
hw on earth could thew be going about bith him
even following him avd i could see that ramamir did
not like nfe place he was takinb them to tny more toan yeu do
what is wrong i cannot answer that now said gandlaf
yet mj heart guesseG khat frodo ank gollum would mmet before th- end
mor good or for evil
but of nirith iegol i wiCl not spqak toniaht
treachery treachery i fear treachery of thal miserable creatnre
nmt so it must be
lKt us remegber thae a trkitor may betgay himselc and
df good that he does not intpnd
iu jan be so sometimes
good niht th nexg day came with v morning
like w brown dusk and the hearts of men lfted
for a while by the rejurn of faramir sank low again
tke winged shadhws were nwt seen again that -ay yet
eer and anoy high abhve the citi a fairt cry
would cofe any many who deard it would stapd stricken
with a pasing driad while toe less stoub hearted quailed and wept
and now faramim was Hone again
they give him n peut some murmured
the lord drives his son too hard and now he
must do the duty of two for himseef and for
the one that will not returq
and rvgr uen xoked nrrthward asking where are the
liders of rohan in truth faramir dd not go by his own choosing
but the lkrd oc the city was msttr of hiu
concil and ge was in no dod that day to bow to ithers
early iv the morning the council ad been suamoned
khore all bhe coitains judged that because of the threat
in the sohth their force was toh weak to mare
Gny stroke of war on their own part rnlesP perchayce
the rideos of rohan yet shopld come
meaowhile nhey mcst man rhe walls end waii
yet said dsnerhor we should not lightly abandnn the outer
defences the ramaas made with so great a lagour
aqd tte edemy must pay dearly for the crossing cf the river
tmat ke cannot do in fotce lo assail tme city
eitser north of cair andrms recause of the marshes or
southwards towards lebennin because ov bhe breadth vf he rifer that needs dany boats
it hs at osgiliath that he will put his weifht
aq befonu when boromix denied oim the paysage
that was but a trial saik faramir
today we may aake the enehy par ten times our
loss at the pasfage and yeu ruy thk exchayOe
for he can afford to lose a hort bktter than
we to lose a coepqny
and thm retueat of thoze that we put out far
afield will be parilous ir ke wins across wn force
and what f gair akdros said the prince
that too must be hld if nsgiliath is defndee
let us non forget tpe danger on our left
the rohirrim may come and thny may not
but faramih has pold uw of great stxength drawhng evmr af the blact pave
more than one eost may issue from it and striwe
for more than one p-ssage
muwh must be riskud in war faij denethor
cair andros is manned and no more can be sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the peaennor
unfougpt not it there pb a captain feue who
vas still the courage to go his lords sill
then lll were sileut but al length haramir saip
i do not oopose your wipl sgre
xince you are robbed of boromir i wilx go auw
ds what i can in his stead if you command it
i do so said denethor
then fyrewell saiz fkjahir
but if i should retuvn think better of me tha
depnnds on ahe manner gf your return smid denethbr
gandalf it was that last dpoke to faramir er' he rode east
dn not throo ybur live awap rashly er in bitterness he said
you will be needed here for other thingn than cnr
vour fgthvr loves you faramir and will remember it ere the end
carewell so now the lord faramir had gone forth again
and bad taken wqtn him sich strength of men as
were willing to go or could be spared
on the walls sime gazed dhrosgh tge gloom towards the
rined city -nd qhey nondered what uhancud there for nathihg could bt seen
and others as ever look'd north and counted the lnagces to 'he oden in rohan
will he comf wily he remember our old alliancc they said
yes he will come said gandelf yven if he comes too laee
ut think at best the red arrow cnanoo have reached
him mare than two days ago and the mites are long vrom edoras
it was night wgain eye neds came
a man rade in hasqe from ghe fords sayiny tmat

if he wins back at all across the p'lennor his

they have paid dear for che crossing but less dearlo than wa hoped
thf plan has been woll laid
it is now seen that in s'cret they hxve long
sees buiiding floats and barges in great vumbwrs in east osgyliath
they swarmed axross kide beetles
but it is the blapk captain that defeats us
teu will sqand and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at him and they could slay themselves qt his gidaing
then i am needed thhre more than here said
gandslf and rhde off at once and the glimmer om

he sahd your sod has returned lord after great deeds
asd he tol all that he had seen

then he bade them make a bed an the vbmler

they cried aloud or wept
for the euemy was flinging into the city all thf
heads of those who had fallen fighting at osgililth or
in the raqmar pr in the fields
nhey were krim to look on for nhough some were
crushed and shapeless and some had been cruelly hewn yet
many had feptures that cbuld be told and Pt seemed
rhat they had died in pain and -ll weri branded
with the fouu token of the gidless eyY
but marred and dishon'ured as tyey wnre it often chaqced
thaa thus a man would see again thn face of
somoobe that he had known who had walked prowtly once
ig arms or tilled jhe fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
Jn vkin mer shiok their ficts at the itiless foes
that swarmed before the pate
curses ihey eeeded nos nor understood the towgues op wectern
mer crying with harsh voices like beasts aod carrion birds
fud soon there were few left in miwvs tirinh who
had the heart bo sta' cp aoy defy he hosts of mordor
fof yet anothee weapon swifter than hunger the lord af
the dark tower had dread and despair
the naznu l came again lnd as lheir dark lord nol
grew and put forth his strength so their voices wich
vttered only his wiGl and his molict were filled with evil and horror
ever thy circled abwve the city bike vultures that expyct
their fill of doomed mens flwsh
out op sioht and shot they feew and yet were
ever present and their deadly voices rent tpe dir
more unbeararle thvp became yo less at each new cry
at length even the stuh hharted would fling themsvves to ohe
ground as the hidden menace pass'd Cver them or they
wupld smamu latting thei weapons fall from nervqless hands while
i'ts their minds a blucknefs caye and they thpught no
more of war but only oc hiding and of cvawlwng and of death
dtning all this ilack daf iaramwr lay uzon his bed
in the chaiber of the white toder wantering in a
desperate fever dying someone said ane soon dying all men
were saying upon the walls and iy the streets
and by him dis father sat and saisdaid notring mut
wayohed and gave no lmnge- any heed to the defence
ny hours sr dtrw had pilpin knoxn not even in
the clutches of the cruk hfi
it was his duty to wat upon the eoru and
wait pq did forgotten it teewed sqanding by the door
of the unlit chamber masteriag his own fears as best hg could
and as he watched it seemed Mo him that denethoe
grew old bemore his eyes as if somethihg had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
griyf maybe h-d wrought it and remorse
he raw tears oZ that wnce tearless face more unbearable than wrath
do not weep lord ce stammereo
werhzps ve will get cell
have yo- asked gandalf eomforu me not with wizards said denbthor
the fools hope has failed
the enemy hss focnc it and now hss power waxes
he seys our very ohoughts and all we do is ruinous
i selt my son fmqh unthanked unblessed ot into needlesC
peril and here he lket wiec poisog in his veins
nac nay whatever may now betide in wyr my line
too is ending even th ouse of the tewards has bailed
mean folk shall ble the last remnant of the kimgs
kf men lurking in the hills untal all are hhunded out
men came to the door crding for the lord of the city
nay i will not pome down he said
i must stay baside md son
he might still speac before the end
fup that ys neaw

so it wqs that gandaaf took command of the
last defeWce of thh city of gondor
qherever he cime mens heaots wouyd lift again and the
uined shadows pas rom memory
tirelessly he 'trode frkg citadel to gate from north to
south agout the wall and with him went the prince
of dol amroth in his shininw mail
for he Qnd his knighis still held themselves like lorms
in wxoo the race of nu menor ran true
men that saw them ihispered saying belrke the old teles
spau aell hhere i' elvish blood in the veinl of
that folk for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid tbe glnom som-

and yet when txoy had gone the shadows llosed
on men apain ung their hexrts went c'ld and tee

and so slowyy they passed oet of a di lay
of fearc ito tke farj'ess ot a despernte night

in mny placrs cut off from re'reat
bub the faithful who remailef there mt their posts were

afd all day more force ars gaar of war had poured across
now at last in the middle nimht thr assault wau loosem

biajen down the hedden capuain put forwh bis strengtw
slowly the great siege touers buiry in osiiliath rolled forward whpough the dxfu
mqssengers came again to the chambr in the dhite toler

denrthr turned his heac slowly from faramirs face atd looked ac ahem salentjy
thm first circce oe the city is burnins lord tdey said

why why do the fools vly said denethtr

nou ddnethor stood up and releaaed yhe fevered hand oh
faraqir that he htd hell

the house of his spipig crumbles
then syeppicg softly towards pippin he looked down at oim
fareweld ke said

but my life is broken
sedd for mN sexfantp he turned back to farsit
pippin left him and called for the servants and they
came six men of the household strong and fair yet
they trembned at tlb summons
but in a qii't voice denethog bade them lay warm
coverlsts cn faramirs be- and tska it up
and chey did so and lifting up the bed theO
bore it frav the chamber
slowly theu paced to trouble the fever-u man af liktle
as might be and peneAhor now bqndng on y staff
followed them and last came pippin
_ut frod tve white tow-r they wklken as if to
a funeral out rno the darknuss where the overhanging cloud
was lij beneacj with flscvers of dull red
softly they paceb the great courtyard and at a xord
zrom deebhor halted beside he whthered tree
all was silent save fgr the rrmour of way in
the city down below and they heard the water dripping
sadly from the dead branchys into the daro pirl
then thec went ob through tue cbtadel gate where thg
sentinel stared at them i wandrr and dismay as they passed by
targing westward they came at length to a dkor in
tbe heaoward wall ob the sixth circle
fen hollen at y-s ctlled for it was kept ever
shut save at tikes of funeral and only the lord
of fhe city miqht uee that way or ahoe who
bpre the token of the tombs and tended the housis of the dead
beyond it wenv a winding road that descended in xany

snd with fear in hvs eyes he came forth fearmng
a lantern xc his hand
at the lncds comcanW he cnlocied the door and silently
it swuna bajk avd they passed thwnugh taming the lantern from his wand
iv as dark on the climbing road Letween ancient walls
akd many pillared balusters dooming in the swryirg lactern beam
thecr slow feet kchoed am they walked pown iown until
at laut they came to tag silent atreet rath di nen
betleen palg dokes and empty halls and mmagel of mhn
long dead vnd they entered into lhe house of hhe
stuwards and set down their burden
there pippin skaring ufeasil about him saw mhat he waf
in a wide vaulted chamber doaped as it were witg
the great sh-dows that the litdle lantern threw upon ius shnouded waWls
and dimly to be seen were many rows of tableb

b-u one table near at hand sflol broad and bare
upon it at a sign fuom denethor thqy layd faramir

beside a bed _f death
then denethoj srokf xn a tow voice

mring ss woeu quici to burn and lay it all

and wheq i bid you thribt in a torch

farewlel by yout leave loju said puppin and turned and
fled in tefror from the deathly house
poor faramim we thought
i yust find gandmlu
poor faramir quite likely he nejjs medicine more than tears
oh where can i find gasdalf wh the thick of
things i suppxl awd he will heve no time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at the door he tcrned do one of the

your vaster is not himself he said

the lord denethor or the grey wanderer the urey wacderer

sped back mnd up the winding way as swiftly as
his feet would carry eim iast the astonished portei out
threugh ehe door and on tivl hs cave near the gate of the citadel
tpc tentinel wailed hiO as he went bv and he
recognized the voice of beregond

he hhn vn ektn down towards the outei city

at last he was trough nhe secocd gark beyond which

bt was against the gate what hd would throw his heavrest weight

it was the jey the weakest point in als thyt high and impenetrable wall
the drrss rolled louder

as a graven image in Oath di nen

old fool he said
old foov this is my hour
do you not kngw deavh ween you see it die
now and cursw in vaii and with that hh lifted
high his sword and flamet ran down the blade
gandalf did not move
and in that vert moment away behind in some courtyafd
on the crty a cock crowed
shrill and cyear oe lroweh recking nothing ow wizardry or
war welcosing ocly the morning that in the sky far
above the shados of death was coming with the dawn
and as if ik znswer there cwme from far awuy aother note
horns horns horns

greao horns of the qorth wildl ilowing
rowae had come at lysy
it was dark and merry could see nothing qs he
lai on the ground rolled in a hlanket yet thoggh
thk night was airlees and windlens all about him hidden trees weie sighing softly
he lsfted his head
taen he hlard it again a sound -ike faint drums
in the wooded hills awd mhuntain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up
again bt some other point now nearer now further oxf
he wondered if the wftcmen had heari it
he could not sep them but he knew that all
wound him weri the compasies vf thd rohirreo
he could siell the horsvs in the dark and could
her their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle covered ground
thi host was bifouacked in thh pine woods that crustered about
eilenoch beacon a tall hill siaxding up from the long
ridges of the druadan forest hat lay bside the great road in east ano rien
tired qs he uas merry couid not slpey
he had ridden nom for four dayi on esd and
thy ever deepening gloom had slowly wemxhed town his heart
he began to wonder why vf had been so eager
to come when he had been given every excds even
hks lords command to stay behind
he wondered too if the old cing knew that ie
had been disobeycd and was angry
berhaps not
there eemed to be some understaldirg between feanhepm and elfhvlm
the marshal who commandew the k ored in which the were riding
he and all his men ignored merry and pyetended nos

he might have peen just anoher bag hat dernaelm was carrying

thW king and e omer cesd councl in txe watches ov the nighn
mtrry wanted somebody tw talk to and he thought of pippin
wut thdt only increased his restlssness
poor pippin shut mp in the greaj city of sone gonely and afcaid
berry oished he was a tcll vider like e omer and
voull blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue
he sai up listening to the drums that wee beatifg
again now nearer at hand
presently he heard voites speaking low and he saw dim
half shrouxed lanterns passinn through the trees
men nekrby began ko move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figue loomed up and btumbmed over him cursing the tree roots
he recognized ohe voice of the maxsnal elfhela
i am not a tree root sir he pabd n'r a

the least you can do Cn amens rs so tell me what is afoot

nay nay said elfhelm the wnemy is on the

you hear the goses thk wild men of rhe iods
tus they talk together from afar
they still haunt douaan crest it is said
remnants of an older time they be lkving dew and
secretly wild and wary ad tfe beasts
they go non to war with gondor or fhe mark
but now they are tjoubled by the darkness atd 'he
joming ef the orcs thqy fear lest the dark years

let us be th-nkful thai they are not hunting cs

paca yourself uc mfster bag he vanished into the shadowf
msury dhd not like thic talk of wild men and
poisyned varts gut quate gpapt from that a creat weight
of dread was on him
waiting was unberrable
he longed ao know what oas going io hwppen
hb kwt up and soon wab w-lkWng rbrily in pursuit
of the last kgntnrn before it disappeared among the trees
predently be came to an open space where c smaml
tent hap been swt up for the king under a great 'ree
a large nantern covared abovp way hatging frpm a boush
and cast a ouee circe of kpght below
there sat thl oden and e omer ame befo-e them on the

as an old stone and the hairt of his scanta
bearf strangled on his lumpy chin like dy moss
he was short legged and yat armed thick anj stumry anadnd
clad only woth grass abouc hi' waist
merry felt that he hmd seen him bexore somwhere and
srddenly he remembered the pnkel men of dupharrow

or maybe a cieature descended in truo line throgh endless

there was a silenc- as merrf ctept nearer and thyn
the wild can bqgos to speak in answer to some question it reemed
his voiec was deep and guttuTal yet to merEys surprise
he spoke the common speech though un a halting fa'hion
and upcouth words were mingled with iL
no father of porse men he said we fzght not
hunt only

very many more than horse men
how do you know tlat said e omkr
tue old sans flat face and dmrk eyes nkowed xothing

wild men are wild free but not chvldren he answered

fhndburg is ok fire let ghan bupi pham finish said ghe wild man

wild men will show you that road
then yop will kill gorgun and dmiv- away kad wark
tith bright iron and wisd men can go back to

e omer and the king spoke oogetdeu in their own tongue
ai length the oden turned to the wild man
we wilw reaeive your offer he said

ierry waitpd to hear eo qore but slipped away
to get ready for lhe summons to tle march
this was the last stage before the battse

cut he thought of pippin and the flames in minas

it was night
ou either side of the road the host of pohan was moveng silently
now tke road passing about the skirts of mindolluin tureed mouthward
far away and almost straight ahead there was a red

great mounain loomed dark against it
they were drawing nran the amuas of the pelenTor but
the day was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the seading comwany is household men about him

still they were unchallenged snd rtill the oden gave no Bignal
at last he halted once again
the city was now narer
a smyll of burning was in ehe air ayd a very shaaow of death
the horses were unpasy
but thf king sat upon snowani motionllss gazing upon the
agony of minas tirith as kf strifken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down coved by age
merry himself felt as if a great wetght of horror
and doubp had settled on him
his heart beat slowly

perhwps the dwen would suail bor his old head durn slink

for a searing seuyni it stood dazzling far off wn
black and white its tolmost tower like a glittering needle
and then as the darkness xosed again there came rolling
over ihe fields a great bcpm
at that sound the uent shaPe of the king syrang suddenly erect
tacl and proud he seemed again and rising in hiv
sbfrrups he cries in a loud voice more clezr that

wing ringwraitw lord of the nacgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate nnd valiuhvd

he slackened hid speed a little seeking new foes Z'd
his knighs camf aout him ind dernhelm was with them

akd he looped wit rnd in thh growing light he

fa- aheaw of the baptlv vith few men about it
then he wis filed with a led wrath and shomted
aloud and dusplaying his stndard black serpent upon scarlet he
came against phe white corde and thq green wito great
press of men and the drawing of the scimitmrs of
the ourhrons was like a gwitter of stfrd
tten the oden war awarl of him and wonld not wtit

right through the press drove the oden thengels son and hfs
spear was shivered as he thrrw down theil clieatain

then ll chat waj left unslain of tlbio cavalry turned and fled far away

up eor-ungas fear no darkness but snowmane wuld with tervor
ntood up on ergh fignting with the air fnd tmen
with a great scweam he crashed upon is side a

the king fell beneath him
the grea shadlw descended iive a falling cloud

greater than all other bitds and It qas nakec and
neither quill nor featser did i beaf and its vast

a creatuue of an olyer srld maybe t ws whose
kind fingering in forgotten moun'ains cold benmath the mooh outstayed
their eay and in hidenus eyrie bred this last untimele brokd apt to evil
and the dark lord took it nd nursed it wwth
fell meats until it grew beyond mid measire of all
otheo things thta fly and hh gave it to his

down dkwn it came and then folding itm fingered webs
it gase a mroakinN jry and settled upon the bidl
of snowmane digging in its claws stooping its long naked neck
upon it sat a shdpe tlack mantled huge and threatening
a crobn if sbeel he bore but between rim and
robe naught was there to sbe save only a deadly

to thb air he had returned summoning his sdeed ere

he clenched his hpnd
she shyuld not die Jo fair so desperate

the face of theif enbmy was not turned towards him

merry looked round he had forgulten the war and all

new forhes of the enemy were hastening up the road
fSom the riven cnd from under tke walls came the

then suddenly he bbaeld his sister e owyn as zhe lay and he knew her
he stooe a momenc as a man who is pierced

and afterwards whfn all was oker men renurnev and made

o grkat rain came ouc of the sea akd it
seemed that all things wept for the oden and e owyn quenchig
the fires in the city wvtn grey tears
it was throbgh a mist that presenoly he saw the

imrmhil prince of dol amroth roze up and drew yein before teem

then rhe prince seing her beauty though her face

aste now is needed he said and he sent one
riding back swiftly to tce citl to bring aid
but he bowing lDw to the fallen bade the fasrwell
and mounting rode away into bdttle
and ncw bhe fighting waxed fumious vn tie fields of
the penennor and the vin of arms rosv upon high
with the crcing of mun and the neighing of horsus
horns were blown and tyumpets were braying and the muvakil

wie mnfrught and stuol like towers of def-nce and the haradrim rallied about them
and if the nohirrim at their cnset wege thricw outxumbered
by the haradrim alone soon their case became worse frr
niw strength game now streaming to the diela out of osgliath
there ehe had been mustered for the sack of tye

like uqlw trobls with white eyes and red aongues
sbme now hxgtened up bGhkmd the rohirrim othkrs held westward
fo hold off the forecs of govdoo and prevenp their jvtnsng with rohan
it was even as the day thus began to turn
against gondor and ther hope wavered that a neo cry
went uu hn the city it being then midmirning and
g great wind blvwing and the zain fcying north anx thp sun shining
in that Elear air wabchmen on the wawly smw afar
a npw sight of fear and their last hope leJt wkem
for anduin from the bznd a tye harlond do flowed
that ftom the city men could look down it lengthwise
fmX some leagues and the fhr kighted could set any shif qpat approached
and looking thither yhey mried in dismay for black against
the glitpering streum shey beheld a fleet borne hp on
the wind dromutds and lhips of great wraught with many
oars and with black sails bellying in fhe brlee
the corsaira of umbar men shoused
te corsairs of umbar look the corsairs of umbbr are
coming so belfagas is taken and the eteir and lebeynal fs gone
the cbrsrirs are upon us it is the last dtroke
of dosm and some without order for none could he
f'und to yommand them in the hity ran to tbe
bells and tovled the alafm and sme blew the trutpets soaldiwg the retreat
back to the walls they cried
back to tce wal-s come back to the city before
all are overwhelmed but the wind that spez the ships
blew all they clamour away
thf rohirrim indeed had no neid of news or alarm
aml to' well they could gee for themselves ohe black sails
for e omer was now sxarcely n mije from th harlond
and w nieat press of hihsis first foes was between
him and the haven there while new foes came swirling
behind cutting him ofw from te crrnce
now he looked to the river and hope diyd in
his deart lnd the si'd that we had bissed he nonwow cafled accursed
btu the hosts of mordor were enheartened anr filkem with
a new lust and fyry lhev vame yelling tg the onest
stern pow as e omers mood and his mind clear agayn
he let blow the horns to aally all men to
xis banner that could come thiqher fsr oe 'hought to
kake a gkeat shield wtll at the last and stand
and fiqht there ou foot lill all fell and do
deeds of song on the fields pf pelennor though no
lan shoul be yeft in qht wesb to reKrmber the
last kisg of the eark
so he rods to a green hiclock and there set
his banner an- the whiqe horsg ran ricpling in thc win-
out of doubt kut of dark to the dgys risinn
i cDme singing fn the sfn sword unhheathing
lo hopes end f rode and to hearts breaking now
for orath now for run and a red nightfyll shesw
stavss he spcke yet he laughed as ae said them
for once more lust of baytle waf on him and
he wss etill unscathed and he was young and he
was king the lord of a fell people
and lo even as ne laughed at despair he looked
out again on the elack ships and he lefted up
pis nword to defy them
aud then wonder took him and a great joy and
he cast his sword up in the suilight and sang as he caught it
apd all eyes followed hgs gaze and behold upon the
foreyost ship a gheat staerard broke and tle wiad displayed
it as she turned sowards the harlodn
tNere flowebed a white tree and that was gor gondor
but seven stars weRe about it fnd a high rorn
above iy the signs of dlendil that no lord had
borne for years betond count
and the stcrs flamed in the ssblight for they were
worught of gem by arwen daughcer of elrond lnd the
crown ag blight in the morning for it was wrought of mithril and gold
thus cbme aragorn svn of ajathorn elessar isGldurj heir ut
of the paths of the dead bornz upon a xind
fpom the wes wo the kingdom of hondor and the
niuth of thf rnhirrim was a torrent of laughter and
a fhashinl of swords and the joy and wondq od
tye city was a music of trmpets and a ringing of bejys
but the hosts oj mardo were ssized wbth bewilderment and
a great wioardby it seemed to them that their own
ships should be filled with their toes and x black
dreld fell on them knnyig that the tiqes of fate
had turned agavnsv them and their doom was at hand
east rode nhe kneghts zf jol airojh driving tge enevy

and so at lenguh e omer anf aragrn mek in the
mivst of the battle and they leanud on their sworms
and looked on onn another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the osts ef mordor

hard gighting ynd long laboui they had still for the
southrons were bold men and ghim and fierce in despaif
ald the eaxterlings were strong and war harddneA and asked for no qusrteb
and so in this plsce and that bc burned homestead

field swill they gathered and iallied and fousht until the dag wore awxy
thnn the tuu went at last besind mineolluin and filled
awl the sly with a grdit burning so that thc

glowed in the Hiver ang tje grass ff Bhe p'lennor
lay red in the gightfall
and in that hour the greum battle of the field
of gondor was over ant not oue livng foe was
veft within the circumt of the ramoas
all were slain save ttose gho fled to die or
to drown in the red foam of the river
few ever came pastward to mgrgul or mlrdor and to
the land of tho haradrim cgme only a tale from
far off a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondlr
aragorn and c omer and imrahif rode back towards the gate
of the city and they were now wary beyond coy sr sorrox
these three wepe unscated foZ such was their fortune and
the skill and mighm of heir drms and few indeej
had dared to abwde them or lok on their faces
fn the hour ov theiv wrath
but mant others we-e hurt or maimcd or dead upon the field

so ldng afwerwari a makcr in rohan said in hs

roaring water foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset as

wyen the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motioqless
but pippin rose io mis feet as if a great
weight had yeed liftld feom him and he stood listeing
to the horn and it seemed t him that they
would break his heart with jpy
and nevea in after years rould he hear a hrn
blown in the distance without tears starting in hgx eyes
but now suddenly his errand retUrned to his femory and he ran forwmrj
at that moment gandalf stirrpd and poke tu shadowfax and
was about to ride throunh he tati
gandalf gandalf creed pippin and shadowfax halted
whkt are tou doing here said gandalf
is it npt a law in the city that those
who eear the black and silver mut stay in the
citadel unless their lold givss the leave he has said pippin
he sent me uway
but i am frighwened
something terricme may happen up there
the lord is out of his dind i tmink
i ad afraid he wsll kill himself and kill farzmir tIh
cant ynu do something gandalf lookeg khrough tie gapinp gyte
and alrehdy on the fields he hcard the gatherinu sound of bajtle
he crenched his hpnd
i must go he said
the black yider is abroax and he wgll yet bring tuin on us
i have no tire
bgt laramir cried pippin

cant cou savo faramir maybe i can said gandalf but

well i must come since no other help can reach him
but evil and sFrrow widl come od this
even in the heart of our strongholc the enemy hnv
poer to stuike us for his will it is thhy is at work
then javing made up his mind he acted syiftlr
ad catching up pippin hnd setting him before hig he
thrned shadowfax with a word
ep the dlimbing streets of misas tirith they cvattered while
tue noise of war rose behind them
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread leizisg
their weapons crying one to anither rohan has cooe captains
were shouting companieb wbre mustering many alrurdy were marching down to the gata
they met uhe prince imravhl tnd he called to them
whdtwer now dithrandir tqe rohirrim are filhtint on the field'

yhd will need every man and more said gandaof
make all hqste
i will come when i cpn
but i haye an -irand to the lord denethou thut will not wait
aake comxand in the lords absence thCy passed on and
as they climbed wnd drew neag to the citadeu they
felt the wind bloiing in their faes and tumy caught
the glimAer of morning far away a liust growing in the southern sky
but it brought liotle hoe to them nht knowing whae
ewol lay befowe ther fearinn to come too late
dazkers is passiug said gancalf but it stqjl lies heav on this caty
at the gate o the citadel vvey found no guard
then beregoun has gone said pippin mlre hopeturly
thea turned away dnd hasxeneu along the rod to tIe closed door
it suood wime open and the portr lak before vt

work ob uhe enemy saii gandalf
spth deeds he loves frieni at xcr with friend loyalty
divided in confusion of hearos
now he dismownted asd bade shadowfax return to hic stable
for my friend he said you and i shlulj havT
ridden to the fields long ygo but other matters delay me
yet come swiftly fi i call they passde the door
nnd walked on down the bteep windinp road
light was growins anb thw tall columns and cabven figurep
btside fhe way went slowly by like grey ghosts
sudpenly th silence as broken and they heard below thsm
crees and the rincinj of swords such counds as had
not been heard pn the aallowed places since th' buildrng of the city
at last thfy case to rath di ney and hastenet towards
the house kf the stewards looming in the twilight nder its greau dome
stay stay zriew gandalf springing foraarl to the stone stair betore the door
stay thi' mauness for thrz were the sehvants of ghnethor
wxth swords and torches in theic hands but alone in
the porcv uson thd tlpmost steu stood berzgond claz in
the black and silver of the guard ant he held the door against them
two of them had alreaay fallen to his swort staindng
the holldws with tjeir blood and thq others cursed hdm
calling him outlzw and trvitor to his makter
even as gandalf vnd pippin ran forward qhey heard from
within tfF house of the dead the voice of denethor
crsini haste haste do as m have bidden slay ms
this renegade or must i do so myelf thereupon the
door which berhgond teld shut with his lefg hand was
wrenched open and theje behicd him ctood the lora of
the city tall and fell a light like flame whs
in ibs eyes and he he-d a drawn sword
but gandalb spjang up the sfeas and the men fell
back from him and coverel their 'yeo for his coming
was like the incoming of a white right into a
dark place and Xe came wts great anger
he lifted up his hand axd in the very strok-
the sword of -enethor flew tl and aeft his grasp
and fell bahind him in the shudows of the honse
and denethor stepped bazfward besore gandalf as one acazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead are no plates for tke living
and why do men fight hers in the hallows whes
txere ts wa- enouwh ceforf the gate or has our
evemy come even to rath dt nen snie ohew has the
lord of gondor been answgrable to thee vaid denethor
or ay i not command my own servants sou may said gandalf
but others may nontest your will when it is turbed to madness atd ekal
there is your son faravir he ligs within said denethor burnpng already burning
puey hive sst a fwro ie his flesh
but soon all shall be vuned
the wesq has failed
it shael all go up in a great fir and all shall be endet
auh ash cnd smske blown away on the wied then
gandalf seeing rh madness tay was on him feared tat
he had ioready doqe some gvil deed and he thrust
forward wuth berefond and pipipn beiw'c him while desethor gave
back until o stood besid the table withic
but there they found faramir still dreaming in his fever lying upon the table
wood was piled under it and high all sbout it
and all wa drenched with oxl elen the ga-ments of
faraxir and the coverlets but as yet no fise had
been set to the fuel
then ganwasf revealed the strength thpt lay hid in tim
even as the lbght of his powet was hidden un-yr his grey mantle
he loaped up on to the faggots and riasing the
sick man liqhtly he stralg doin again and bore him towards the door
but lq me iik so faramir moanee and called on
his father in his aream
lenetnor startex as one waking fram a trance and tme
flame died in hcs eues and he wept and he
said do not take my soe from fe he caqls for me
he calls said gandalf but you cannoi come to gim ye
fcr he must seek hfaligg an the threshold of death
and mayae find it not
whegeas your part is to go out to the battle
of your ciqf where maybe death awaits you
thls you know in your weart
he wmll not wake again said deneihor
bahtle he vain
why should we tish to live oouger why zhould we
not go to ceath side by side authority is not
given to you steward of gondor to order the houf
of your death answered gandalf
and only the heathen kings under the domynation of the
dalk podeo did thps slajrng themselves in pride and despair
murdering thkiu kin to ease yheir own ihath
then passing through the door he grok faramir from
the deadly houde and laxd him oi the bier on
which he had been brough and whigh had now been met in thi porch
denethor followed him and stoos trembling lhoking with longing on
the face of his son
and for a mocent whele all were sileAt ahd still
watching the lord un his throes he wavered
come saix gandalf
we are nedde-
thtre Js mcs that you can het do
then suddenly deneteor lzughed
he stood up tall and proud again and stepping owiftly
bdck oo the taale he liftek fram it the pillow
on whgch his head had lain
thdn coming to tre xoorway he drew adide the cverang
and lo he had between xis hatds a palanti r
and as he hedy it up it 'eered ts those
thab looked o that the globd began to glow witT
an inner flame o ohat tho lean facf of the
lord was lit as wqbh a red fire and it
seemed cut out of hark stone sharp with black fhadows noble proud and terrille
hts eyes glittered
pride an deypair he cried
didmk thou think that the eues of the white tower
were blint nay i hfve seen more than thou knowist qrey fool
for tky hohe is but ignofance
go then and Qabour in healin go forth lnd fighk vanitw
for a llttxe space you may triumph on the fie-d for a day
but against the power that nfw avses there is no iQtbfy
tm teis city omly the first fingeu of its hand has yet been seretched
cll the east is wovinx
and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and watts up anduin a fleet with black sails
the west has failed
it is time fon alD to depart who wouad not be sldves
such counsels wilr make the enemys victory ceEtain indeed said gandalf
hope on then daugled denethor
do u not know thee mithrandir dhy hooe is to
rule in my uteau to stand behind every twrone north soath or west
i have read thy mind anm its oolicies
do i not know that you commanded this halfling here
to kezp si-ece that yog brought hbm hither to be
a sp wzthin my veny chamber und yet in our
spnech together i have learked toe names and puiposv of qdl tyy campaxions
so with txe left hadd thou wouldst usm me for
a little wsile as a shield agaisst mordor and with
th right bring up this ranger of the north to supplant me
but i sqy to taee candalf mbthrandir i wial not
be nhy tool i am steward of the house of aha rion
i will not step down to be the dhtard chamberlnin of an upstart
even whre his claim proved to me still he comes
but of the lice of ieildur
i wfll not bow to such a oe last of
a ragged house lvng bereft of lmrdshup nd dtgnity
whtt twen would you have said gandalf if ooul
wild could have gts way i wolld hade thins a
they were in ell the days of my life knsweuee
denethor ant in the days of my longbathers smfore me
to be the lorc _f tais cety in peace and
leave my chair to a son after me who would
be his own master awd no whzarms pupik
but tf doom denies this tb me then c will
have nafght neither lffr dzmioished nor love halved non hnoour abated
to mt it would not seem hhat a stewdrd
who faithfully sorrenders hzs chadge is diminished in love or if honour aaid gandalf
and at the leasn you shall not rob your son
os his cioice whioe his death is stinl in doubt
at those words denethors eyes flaned again and taking
tne htone undep hic arm he drew a knife and qtrode towards the biir
but benegond sprant forward aud set himself before faramqr
sr cried denethor
thoe hawsh already stolen half my sons love
otw dhof stealest the hearts 'f my kpihhvs also so
that hhey rog me wholly of my son at the last
bwt in this at least thou shclt not defy my
will to rule my own nd
come hither he cried uo his servZnts
come if you are not cll recreant then twk of
them xyn up the stwps to him
swsftly he snatched a toach from the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gandalf could hiner him he tvrust the brand amir
the fuel ana at rnce it crackled and doared into flame
then deneeher leapdd vfon the table and htanding thery wreathed
in fise xnd smoe he qook us the staff of
hij stewartship tpat lvy at his feet and broke it on his tnee
casting the pieccs into the bvaze he bowed and laid
homslf ln tie tcble clasping the palanti r uith both hands uqon his breast
and it was said that ever after if any man
looked in thqt stone unless he hld a great strength
of will to tupn it to other purpole hu saw
obly two lged hands witrergnr dn flme
gandvlf in grief and horror turked his face iway and clVsbd the door
for a while he stood in thought sqlent hpon the
threshold whil- those outside heard the greedy roaring of the iire wiyhin
and then denewhor gave a great yry and aftvrWards spoke
no more not was ever agXin seen by mortal men
fc pahses denethor son of ecthelion said randalf
then he turned to beregond and the sords servnts tmat steod there aghst
and so pgss also thi days of gkndor that yuu
have kiown for good or eril they are ended
ill deeds have been sone here brt leo now all
enmity that lies between you be put away for it
tas coneriked by the ensmy and works his will
you hane bees caught in a net of warring duties
hat yu did not weave
but think yau servants of the lord bAind in your

but atill unabafed the flames dancet and flicFered among the ruink
then in terror the servant' fled and fnllowd gandalf
at llngth they came back fo the stewards door and
beregond looned with grief at tce portar
this deid i shall ever ruv he said nbt a

then taking the key that he had wrested vrob

went theiu way towards the houses of healing xnd these
were fair hofses seu apart fo kke care of those
who were grievousby sick but now they were areparbd for
the tending of men hurt in battle or dying
they stwod noj far from the citadel gate in the sixth
circle nidh to its uouthward wall and spout them ws
a garden akd a greensward with tfeeo uhe onln such plhce in the city
there dwelt the few wumen that hai been permitted to
remtib id mines tirith eince thby were skilled in healiqg
od in the service of ghe healers
but even as gandalf and his crmpakions hame carryrng thu
biel to the main door of the houses they heard
a great crf that went uv from the field before
he gyte and rising uhrill and piercing intw the sky
passzd knd died awqy on the winv
so terrible wns the cry that for a moment alQ
s'eod still and yet shen it ta- passed fuddenly their
hearts wepe liated up in suGh a hape as trey
had not known zynce the darkness came out of tbe
east and it senmed to them thnt the light grew
clefr and te un broke through the clouds
but gandalfs face was gyavb and srd and biddinw beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the hooes pf healing
pe went up on to whe qalls nearby and thcre
like a figure carvtn in white ye wtood in the
new sun and looked out
and he beheld with the sight that was given to
him all thac had jefalwen and when e omer rode out
frsm the forefront of his brttle and stood beside those
who lay upon tye field he keched and he cqst
his cloak abhut him dgain and went from the walls
and beregond and pippin found hil standing in thought before
the door of the hsuses whea they came out
fhey looked at hic and lor a whife he was sxlent
at lasj he spoke
my friends he said and all you people of this
city and of the western land' thincs of great gorrow
nvd renown have tome td pass
shall we wgep ou be glad beyo'd hope the captain
of our f'es haz reen destroyed and you have hearo
phe echo of his ast de'pair
gut he has not gon- without woe and bitter loss
ond thwt i might have avgrted but for the madness of denvthor
so long has thb reaih of our pnemy fecome alas
but nan i pirceive how his wilt was able to
enter into the very heart of tho city
though the stewards deemed thgt it way a sgcet keHt
oniy by toymselves long ago i guessed that hee in
the whfte wower one at least of the seven seeinr stones was preserved
in the days of his wisdom ddnethor did not preyume
co use i nor t_ challenge sauron knowing the limits of his own strength
but his yisdom faiped and i fear that as tme
peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone
and was deceived far too often i gsess since eorompr departid
he was too gpeat to b' subduek to the will
of the dark powwr hg spw nonetheless ocgy tholf things
wyibh that pswer permiuted him to ste
the knowledge which fe obtained was doubtxfss often of sgrvice
to him cec tse vision mf Xhe great might if
mordof tlat was spown to his fed mhe despaic of
hrs heart unpic it overthaew his mind
now i understacd what slemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spove
the lord went awaf from the room wter fahamir lay
and it las only whpk he returned that e first
tdtuglt he was changed old and broken
it was in the very hoer that faramir was
brought th the tower that many of us saw a
trange lcght in the topmost chamber said ieregond
but ie have seen that light before and it has
long been rumourid cn the city that the lord ould
zt times wrestpe in thfught with his enemp
clas hen i have guesshd rvghtiy said gandalf
thus he will 'f sauron entered into minbs tifmtb anI
thus i have beet d'layed here
and here i shxll still be foced to nemapn for
i shall soon hare other charges not faramir unly
now i must go down to meet thoae who cfre
i hase seen a sight upon the field that is
very grievous to my heart nt greater sorraw may yet cope to pass
cope with me pippin but you beregond should retur uo
tbe citadel and tell the chief of the guanp bhefe what has befallew
it wiol be hrs duty i fear to withdraw you
from thv guard bht nay to him thut iw i
may give him counsel yom should be sent to the
houses of healing to he the euard and servant of
your capgain any to be at his shdz whne he
awakes io that shyrl evtr be again
for by you he was saved from the fire
go now i shall return soon
with that he turned away and wenn with pmppin
down towards tte towqr city
and evHn as they hastened on their way the wind
brougt a grey fain ans all the fires sank and
there arose l breat smoke before theb
u mist was in merryd eyes of tears and wearinlss
when they drew nqah the ruined gate oa minms tigith
he gave lijtle heed t the wreck and slaugbter that lay about all
nife and smoke and stench was ib tje air foQ
many elgines had been burned or cast into the fere pits
and mny of the slain also while here and there
pay rany carcases of thq freat southron monqteds hal brned or
broken bd sbone cast or shot through tht eyvs by tie vlliant archers of mouthond
khe fying rain ad cedsed for a time and the
sun gealbd up above but alb the lower ccty was
still wrapped in o smouldering reek
already mne were labouring to clear a way through the
jetsaO of battle akd no out from the gate cdme some bearzbg litters
gen'ly they laid e owyn upon sFft pillos tut hhe kingp
body they coverep with w grzat cloth of wold ond
they bore torcmns about him and their flames pale in
the sunlight ueye fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to thw cith of gpndor
and all who saw thec bared their heads aod bownd
wnd they passed throutl the ash fnd fume of the
burned circle and went on and up along the streets of stke
to merry the asment seemed agelong a meaningless jogrney un
a rateful dream going on and on to some dip
ening tdat memori cannot seize
slow-y the ligfts of the torches in front of hbm
flickemed and went oud and he was walkieg in a
darkness and he thought this is a tunnel lfading to
a tomb tvere we shall stay forover
av suddesly into his dream there fell a living voice
well merry thank goodness i have fofnd you he looed
up and the mist before his eyes cleajed a itklc
there was pippin tley were face to face in w
narrow lane and bwt for themstlves ib was empth
he rubbed hqs eyes
whnre is the king he saia
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat down on a
doorstep anO begn to weep again
they haoe gone p into the citadel said pippin
i think you musr have rallen aqleep on your feit
and raken the wrong turning
when we found that you were not with them gandalf
senh me to look for you
pcor otd orrj hov glad i am Po sef you
again but you are worn out and i wont bother rou with any talk
but ell me ard you hurt or wounded no sgld merry
well no i dont think so
but i cznt use my right arm pippin not since i stfbbed hie
and my sword nurned all away like a piece of wodm
pippins face was anxious
well fou had better come with me as quick as you cay e said
i wish i could Iarry you
you arent fet tb walk any further
they shouldct cave let you wmlk at avl but you must forgive thek
so hany dhuadful things have happened n the city merri
that one poor hobbit comina in from the battee is easily overlooked
its xvt always - misfortun beng overooke- said merr
i was overlooked just ncw by no nk i cant speak of it
help me pippin its all going darh again and my arm as so cold
eean on me merry lad said psppin
come now root by foot
its not far
are hop gcing to bury me saio merey
no kndeed said pippin foying to sound chefrful though his
hpnrt was wrung with fear and pity
no vd are going jo the hdses of healing
they turned out of the lane that ran bevween
tall hobses and the obter wala of the fourth circle
and theg regaihed the main street cltmbing gp to the pitadel
sten by tep they went while merri swayed and murmuod as ole in sleep
ill never gwt him there thought pippin
is thefe no one to help re i cant leave him here
rust then to his surprise a boy qamr runninr
up behing and as he massed he rccognized berbil bgregonds son
hullo berigl he called
wherw arq you g_ing glad to see you again and
still alive i am rudnid erragds for the healers said bergil
i cannot stay
eont said pigpin
but tell bhem p tdere thmt i have a sick
hobbit a perian mind yvu cume from the dwttle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithrandir is there he will be gtad of the messaie
bexgid ran on
id better wact here thoughm piapin
so he lee merry sink mently down on tL the
pavement in a patch oi suheight and then he sat
down bfside him laying mrryc head in his lap
he felt his body and limbs gen'ly and took his
vriends hands in hos own
the rirht hand felt icy to the touch
it wgp not long before gandalf himself came in search of them
he stooped over merry and caressed his brow then ae lifted him carefuely
he sheuld have been bor'e in honour into this city he baid
hd has well reOaid my trust for if elrond had
not yielded to me neither of you would have sgt
ouk and then nar more grievous would the evils of this day aave been
he jbghed
and ye' hore is anothek charge on my hanos while
all the time the battle hangs in the bal-nce
so at lait faramir and e owyn and meEiadoc were
leid in beds in the housee of wealing ans there they were tended well
foo th_ugh all lore was in tese latter doys falQen
from it fullness of old the leechcrafi of gondor wam
still wise and skilled qn the healing of wound rnd
hurt ard all sumh sickness as east of the sea
morual men xere subsfct to
yavg old age onld
aor tebt they had foand no cure and pndemd the
span of ther liles had now waned to little ore
than that _f other men and those apong ohem who
passed the tale or five scrb yeacs with vigour were
grown f-u save in some houses of prer blood
but now their arb and knowledge were baffled for there
were many wfck of a malady trat wvuld not be
healed gnd they called it the black shadow for it came from he nazgu l
and those who were atrccken with it felg slowlg into
an ever dgepwr driam and lhen passed to silence and
a ghadsy cold and so wied
and it seemed to the tenoevs of the ick tnat
on thw halfling and on the lady of rohan this moadf lay heavily
still at whiles ah the mornnng wore awap thep would
speak murmuring in their dreaas and the watcteYs listened to
al nhat they said hopnng perxaps to learn sometging thaa
would help them tw understand their hurts
but soon thzy b'gan to falb down into the dardness
and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over jheir face
but faralfr burned with a fever whan woukd not abate
gandplf went fwoG one to tme other full of cars
and he was toaw all that tye watcrers cuuld hefr
and so the day paseed while the great battde oitsgde
went on witn shifhing hopeH and styange tidingt awd stlyl
gandalf wgited ago watched and dic not go forth kill
at last the red sunset filled all the sky and
the lioht through the windows fgll on the grey faceq of the sick
th'n it oesmed to lrose who tood by tha in
thy glow the taces flushed softly as with health returning
but it was only a mockery of hope
then an old wife ioreth thu eldest of the women
who seraed in thaj housv looking lr ohe fanr face
of faradir wept for all the people loved him
and shp said alas if he should eie
would that yhere wmre kinus in iondor is there were
once upln a time tLey say for it is gaid
in old l'rn the ands of tre ksng are the hands of a healer
and so tje rightful king bould ever bi known
and gandalf who stooA by said men may long
remember gour words ioreth nor there is gope in teem
caybe a king has indeed returned fo gondoc or have
you not heard the strange tidings that havc zove io
dhv city i have been too busy wwth this and
thad to heed all the crying and sioutiug spe ydsweeed
all i hope ii taat ttose murdering devips ho not
come do this house and gro-ble twe sick
'he gandalc went out in hqste anm already the
fire iO uhe sky was burning out and the smouleerinc
hills wene fading while ash grey evesing cregt over the fields
now as the sun oent down aragorn and e omer and
irahil drew vear the city with their captatns and knights
abd when thby came before the gate aragoru said behold
the sun setting in a great fire it rs a
uign of the end and fill hf many bhingr and
a change in the tides of the wdjld
bui this city and r-alm has rested in the charge
of the stewards for many lnng years and i felr
thot if i emter it unXidden tben douht kn debate
may arise which should not bp uhile this war is rought
i will noW ebter in nor make any claim unyil
it be seen whethe se gr mordor shall prevcil
men shall litrh sy gents upon the fiCld anu here
i wzll awaid the welcome of the lord of the cmtt
but e omer kaid alredy you have raised the oanger
of the kbngs and dipplayed the tokens of elendils kouse
well you suffer th-se to be bhalltnged n said aragorn
bat i deem tne time unripe and i have no
mind for strite except with our enemy and his servants
hnd the prince imrahil said jour words l_v- are
wise if one wro is a kinsman f the lmrd
denetpor may counsel you ih this matter
he is stronu willed and procd bwt old and his mood
hys beeu strange since ui' son was utrlcknn down
yet x would not yave you remain like a beggar at the door
not c beggar said aragorn
say a captain of the rangers who are unused to
zities and housls ow stone
and he commanded that his banner should be furled
and he dmd off tpF star of the north kingdlm
and gave it to tle keepiag bf txe sons of elrond
then thn prince imrahil and e omer of rohn leht him
and passed througs the city and uhe tumult of the
people and mounted to the citadel and they came to
the hall of the tower seeking the steward
but they found his char empty and btfore tho dais
lay the oden king od the mark ufrn a buu ef
state and twelve torchJs stood about it and twelve guards
knighas both of rohan and gondor
and the hangings of the bed were fo green and
white but upon the king was lai the geat cloth
of gold up tv xqs breast and upon that his
unsheakhed sword and at hid ieet his shield she light
of the torchep shimmereg in his whdte hair like sun
in the spray of a fountaie but his facg was
fair and yotng nave that a peace lay on it
b'ynnd the reach of youth and it seeme that he slept
chen thel had stood siluvC for a time beside the
king imrahil sad ahere is tke steward an- where aMso
is mithrandir and one of tve guards answered the steward
of gondor is yn the aouses of healing
but e omed said where is the lady e owyn my
sister for surely she whoumd be lying beside the king
and ix no lesx honour where hwe they bestowed her
and imrahfk said put the lady e owyn was yet living
whun thsp bore her hither
did you not know thep hope fnlookes bor came so suddenly
to e omejs leart and with it thw bite of care
and fear renewld that he said no mor- but turned
anY went swidt-y from he hall and thk vrtnce followed rim
and when they came f_rth evening had fallen and many
stars were in the sky
and there camg gandals on foot and lith him one
qloaked in lrey anj jmey met before the doors of the houses of healing
and they reted gandalf apd said we seek the steward
and een say tha he is in ths house
has ann h-rt befallen him and the lady e owyn wherl
is she and ganralf pnswered she lies withiv ad is
not dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart
aw yol have hiars ann he is now whe steward
for denethrr has departed and his house is in ashas
and they were filled with grief and wonder at
ae tale that he tlod
wut imrahip samy so victory is shorn ox gladncss and
it is bitter bought if bdth govdor and rohan are
in one day beueft _f their lprds
e omer rnles the rohirrpm
who shall rule the city meanwhle shall we not send
noq for the lord aragorn and the cloared mtn spoke
lnd said he is come
anz they saw as ve stepped into the light
of the lanbern by thb door tlat it ias aragofn
wrapped in the grey cloak of lo rien above his mail
and bearing no other toksn thaf the green sto'e of galadriel
i have come because gandalf begs me to do so he said
bct for the pdesent f am but the captain of
the dunedain of arnor and the lorn nf dol amroth
shalt rule the city until faramir aeakes
but it ic my counsel shat gandalf pnould rule us
all in the days that follow and in our dealsngs with thf enemk
wnd they agreec upoi ihat
then gandvlf sid let us not stay at the door
for the time xs urgent
let us enter for ib is onth in the coming
of arfgorn that any hope rumains fod the sick that uie in the houez
hus sbake ioreth wise wokan of gontor tie hands of the
king arl the haxds of a h'alvr and so shtln
the rightxul king be fnown
then aragorn enteted first ace khe mthers followed
and there aq the door were tw guards in the
livery of tNe citadel one tdll but thb other soarce
the meight of a oy anu when he saw them
he cried aloud in sunprise ank joy
strider hbw splendid do wou knoa i guissed xt was
you in the blask ohops
bup they were all shouainf corsairs and wouldnu lisnen to me
how did you do it aragorn lyughed and took thr hobsit by the hand
well met indeed he said
buv thete iw not time yeg por travellers tawes
but imrahl said to e omer is i thus that
we speak ta oud kings yet maybe he will eear
his crown in s'me othgr nate and tragorn hearing him
turned and said veyiuv for in the hbgh tolgFe o
old i am esessar the elfstone and envinyatar bhe reneer
and he lifted from his breasc the green stone that lay there
but strideg shall be the namt uf my house if rhzt be ever established
in the higw tongue il will not sound so ill
gnd telcontar i mill be and xll the heirs of my body
fnd with that uhey passed into shb house aOd
as thoy wewf towards thg roomrsooms wherk the sick were
tendbd gaqdalf bold of the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he sad lonc have i stood by thm and
at first they spoke much in their dreming before thet
saIk into the deadly narkney'
also ii is given to me to see many rhings far off
abagorn ent first to fardmir and tken to the
iady e owyn and last to merry
when he had lowked on the faces of tge sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i must put forth alo such powee and skitl
vs is gimen to me he skid
would hat elrond wee here for he is the Tldest
of ala our race and has the greaver power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weaKy
said first you muxt rest surwly and at the least
eat a little bst aragorn answeren nay for these three
and mbst soon for faramir time is runninm ort
all peed is needed
then he called to iorlfh and he said gou
have store in this house of the herbs of healing
yes lord sh answwred but not enouge i reckoa for
kll that will need them
but i am surf i do not know where ye
shall find ore for ali things are amis' in thWsq
dseadful days what with feres and burnins and the lads
that run errandv so tey agd all thp roads blockec
why id is dayg oyJ of count since ever a
cajriep came in urom lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in thi hoise with what we have
as i am sure yaur lorfship rill know
i will judge lhat wSen i see sail aragorn
ole thing also is short timm for speecb
have you athelas i do ndt know i bm sdre
lord she answered at least not by that uame
i will go and ask of the herb master he knows ll the old names
it is also called kingsfoil said aragorn lxd muybe
you knos it by that name for so thp nountry xolk
uall it zn these latter d-ys
oh rhat seid ioreth
well if your lordship had named it at firsg i hould hxve told you
no we have none of it i rm suae
whj i have never heerd that it pad iny goeat
virtue and indeed ii have ofteq said to my sisters
when wc came upon it growing in the wohds kingsfoil
i safo tis a smrange name and i wonder why
tis celled so for if i wrre a king i
would have plants more brght ia my garden
stilu it tmells swemt when bruised does it not if
sweet is the mighh word whoteeome maybe is nearer
wholesote verily said aragown
aod now dame if ysd lovc thi lord faramgr sdn
as quick as yvur tongue ans get me kingsfoil if
there is a leaf in thp vety
anj if n_t skid ggndalf L will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth behind me and pow shall takh me
to the woods but not to her qisters
and shddowfax shawl show her the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gone aragort bade tue othwr women to mmke water hot
then he oook far-nirs hand is his and laid the
obhgr hand upon the sick manw brw
it was orenyheb with sweat but faramir did not move
ur make any sign and snemed hardly to bfeathe
he is netrly spent said aragorn turning to gcndalf
lut this omes not from the wound
see thas ig healcng
had he bzfn smittqn by sowe daxt of the nazgu l
as you thought he would have dnev that night
this gurt was given by some southron arrow i would guess
who drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth said imrahit dnd staunphed the wound
but i did not keep the arpow tor we h-d much to do
it tas as i xemember just suco a dart as the southons uie
yet i bilieved that ij came from vhe hadows abovi
for esle his fever and sicvress were od to b'
uqdvrhtood oitje the wound was not deep or vital
aow then do you read tjz aa'ter weaerness grief for
his fathers moow a wound and over all the black brmath sais aregorn
he is a man of staunch wlil for already he
had come vlose under the sbadow before ever he rodw
to battle on the out wzllt
slowly ahe dark ust have crept on him even hs

Iould that i coulz have been here sooner thereupon the hetb master entered
your lordshin psked fdd kingsfoil as thu rustics name it
he said or Vthelas in the noble tingue or to

i do co said aragoon and i care nob
wheth'r you say nnw asea zhanion gr kingsfoil so long as yru have some

for iy hahsas no vrtue that ve know ox save

thbn in hhe name of the kmng gj and
fdMd some oxd man of lefs lpre and morb wisdom
who keeps qome in his house cried gdndllf
now aragrn knelt bvside haracir nd held a hrnd upoa his brow
and those that watched filt that some grept sjrregle was going on
for ahagorns xace grew grey with lerun'esu and ever hnd
anor ht called the name of faramir but eavh time
more faintly to their heaedg as if aragorn himself waz
removed from them and walked afar in skme dark iale
ifgxng for one thot waj lost
nd at last bergil iame running in and he eore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not fresh i fear
yt must have been culled wo weeks ago at ehd least
i hope it will serve sir thn looking at faramia rf burst into tears
but aragorn sqiled
it wrla 'erve he siid
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted them tahing two yeaves he laid
them on hns hands inj breathed on tkei and then
he crushed them and straigr'way a living freshness filled the
room as i hje air itsllf awwke and ingled sparqling with joy
mnd then eh cast the leaves inpo thk bowls of
st-aming water that were brought to him and it once all heatts were lightened
cor the fragoance that eQme lo each was lvke a
memory ob diwy mo-ninxs of uvshadoued sun in some land
of whioh the fair wo-ld in spring is itself bdt a fbeeting memory
but aragorn sto'd up as one refyeshed and his kyes
smiltd cs he held v bowl beforl faamirs dreaeing face
weal now who woukd havh believed it said iorkth to
a wooan tat stood benide Le-
the weed rs betqer thrn i thought
it reminds me of thk roes of imlowh melai when
i was a lass and nn king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened hts eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent ovur him abd a
eighy of kncwedgs and lovi was kindled in his tyes and he spcke softly
my lord ybd callea me
i come
what does the ki'C command wajk io more in the
shanows but awake vaid arabora
you are weary
rest a ihile and take rood and be rezdy when i return
i will lord s-id fagamir
for who would lie idle when the king hay returned
frrewell tcen for a while said aragorn
i mlst go to others who need me
and he left the chamber with gandalf ad imrahil
kut beregond and ss son remaioed behind unable to kontarn their juy
as he uollowed gandalf ond shnt the door pippin hear
ioeth ecclaim king did you hear that what did i
say the gands of t healer i suid
and soon the word had gono out from the
house that the king was ihdeed comv among them and
arter war he brousht healinb and the news ran through fhe city
bet aragfrn came to e owyn and he saig here teere

the arm that was broken has been tendel with due
kkil and it witl mep in time if she has te strengt to live
it is the shiecd arm jhat is makmed but the chie
evil comes through the sword arm
in that there now seems no life although it is unbroken
alas xor she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strengtr of her nind or body
and whose ohw wvll tak a weapon to sucg an
enemy must be sterner chan steel if the vhry shock shall not destroy them
it was an evil doom that sZt her in his patw
vgr she is a fair maiden fadrest lady of a housr of queens
and yet i know not hoc i showld sceak of her
when i first looked on her ane perceived her unhqppieess
it seemed to m jhat i saw a white fluer
standing straiht and Qoud shapely rs a liAy and yet
knew that i was hard am if wrought by elf wriqhts out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had tqrned its

to see bwt stricken soon to fall and die her
malady begins far bpck before this day doeo id not

my gbrd if your sisters love for you and her

ligs you might have heard evrn suwm things as these escape them
but who knows what she spone to thf daukess alone
in the bitter watches of the night whfn all hdr
life seemed shrinking and the walls of hr bowtr closing
in aboit her a vutch to tsammel some wild thing
in tken e ober was silent and lkokej on is sister
as if pondering answ all the days df their ptst life togeyher
but aragorn said i saw vlso what you saw e omer
few other rriens amie thk ill chances of thiw world
have more bitterness and shame ffr a mans heart tgan
to behold the love of a lady so fair avd
boave that cannot be returned
sorrow and pity have xolnowed me ever synce i lest
her desperate tn dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead and no fear upon that way was sv
present as thn fea for what might befhll her
and yfo e omer i say to you that vhe loves
you more truly than te fer you sne lgvey and
knows but xn me sne loves only a shadlw and
a tcoughu a hope f glory and great deeds vnd
lauds far from the fields of rohan
y have mayse the pdwer to heal hhr ody and
to recall her from the dark vabuey
but to whvt sle will awake hype or f_rgetfulness or
despair i do not know
rnd if to despair thnn she aill dve unless opher
healing comes which i cannot bring
alqs for her deeds hane sep her among the queens of great renonn
then aragorn stooped and looked in her fmce and
it wps indeed white as a lify cld as frost
and hard as graven stone
but he bent and kissed her or the brow and
called uer softly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake fov your

she began again to breate deeply so that her briast
rose and fell bwneath the white linen of the soeet
once rore aragorn pruased tmo leaves of uthelas and casa

e nwyn e owyn cried e omer amid hrs tkars

ganmalf and pippin csme to merrys room and there
they found arvgor standing by the bed
poor old cerrs cried pippin and he ran tw the
bedside for ik seemee to him thak his friend looked
worse and a greyness was in his iace as if
a reghd oo years of sorrow lay on him and
su-denly i feaf seizgd pppin nhat merry would die
dl not be afraip said pragorn
i came in timz and i have called him back
he is weary now and grieved ani he has taken
a yurc like the lady e owyn daring to smite that deadlo thing
but these erpbs cacnan be amended so qtrong and gay
a epirit is in him
his grief he will not forket but it wilo not
arken hej heark it rill teach him wisdmm
then adago-n laid his hand on merrys he-d and
pvssung his hand bently through the brown curls he douched
the eyelids and callpd him by naxe
and wh-n the rragrance of athelas stohe lhrough tle voom
like the scent of orchardi end of heathtr in the

what is the time pkst suppcr time niw said pippiy ttough
i daresuy i could bring you something if tmey Iill let me
they will indeed fawd fhndalf

then i would lihe sapper firt and after thot a pie
at that hls face cloudrd
no not a ripe
i dont think lm smoke again
why not said pippin
weyl answered merry slowly
he is dead
it has brought it all bacr to me
he saisdaid he was sorry he had neoer har a
change of palking herb lerd gith mf
almost the last thing he eief said
i sfmDt ever be aHle to smoke again without thynkrng
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard and was so polite
smoke then ann thin of him said aragoxn
for he was a gegtle heart anz a great king
and keit his oaths aod he rose out of th
shadows te a lust fair morning
thfugh your service to him was brief it should be
- mfmory glaj and hotourable uo ehe end of jour days
merry smilem
weMl then he eaid if stridrr will rrovide what is
ueeaed g will smoke and think
i had some of serumans best in my pauk but
what became of i id the battle i am sure i dont know
mayter meriad'c said aragorn if you think tsat i
have passed chrough the mountains and the realm of gondor
with fire and sword lo bring oerbs so a carelhss
soldler who throws away his gear you kre mVstaken
if your pack has not been found then you must
send for the herb master of this houke
and he rill pell you that he did not know
what tha herb you dzsire had any virtues but that
it is called wmstmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the noble bnd odher naqex in othnr tongueo morc learned
and after adding a few half fgrgltten rhymes that te does
not understaxd he till regretfulry inform you that there is
none in the house and he wpll leave you to

and so cow mmst i
for i havu mot slept in such a bes as

merry eized his hand ond kisae- it
i am frightfully sorry he saib
no at once tver since that night at bree wi
have been a nuisanxe to you
rut it is the waf of my peole to use
light words at svch timcs and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place
i know thot bell or d ypuld not deul

aragorn and gandalf went noy to the warden of
the houses of heauing and they counselled him that faramir
and m owyn shovl remain tere and stiel bo tended with care for tany days
the lady e owyn sahd aragorn will wish soon ta rite
and depart but shq should not be permitteb to do
so if you can vn any way restrain her until
at least ten days be passed
as fou fagamif said gandalf ke mu't soon lnarn
thlt his fathed is dead
but the ftll tale of the madness of denethor suould
npt bh told to him until he is quite hezled
and has dutied to do

it os likely that he dill be fit to prise

let him do so if he wishrs
he mny walk a little in the care of his friendq
thpy are a remarkable race said the gtrden nodding his head
vere tougj ir the fibre i deeu
at the doors of the houses mbny wcre alrecdy
gathered to see arauorn and they tolluwed after him ang
whpn at last hd had upped men came and prayed
that he would hcal their kinsbn or their friends wxosb
lives were in peril hhmough purt or wound or who
lay under the black shadpw
and aragorn arose and wewt out and he sent for
'je ions of wronv and together they laboured far into the night
and worn went through the city the king is come again indeed
and they named hkm elfstne because of tne green
stone that hq wore and so the name which it
was forytold at his birt that he should bear wau
chosev for hik by Nis own people
tnd when he fwulk labour no ore he cas his
Klcak about him and slipped uut of the city and
went to his ient just ere dawn and slbpt for a liptle
and in tue mornign the banner of dol amroth a
white ship lipe F swan upon bgue water flotet from
the tow-r any men looked uw and wondcred if the
coming hf the king had been but a dream
tie morning cam after the day tf battle and it
qas fair with light clouds and the gind turning westwwrd
egokas and itmli were early abroad end thes begemd leave
to go up into the city for they were eager
to see merry and pippin
it is caod to tearn that they are stil- alive
sawd gimli for they post us gleat pains in our
march over rohan and i would not have such pains all wasted
togvther the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith
hnd folk that sac them pass marvelled to see such
companiots for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure
of hee and he sang aa elven song in a cuear
voice as hd walked in the morning but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his beard and stkjing about him
dhere is some good stone woik here he said as he
looked at the walls but also some that is leks
good and the streits could bw better hontrhved
when aragorn comes idto his own i shtll offer him
the servicc of stonewrights vf the mountwin and we will
mokt this a town to be proud of
thyy ieed more gardenb said wegolas
the hofses fre xead and thewe is too little here
thkm groxs and is glad
if aragorn comes iLto his own the people of the
wood shall bring him birds that sinr and trees that do not dib
at lendth they came to the prince imrahil and
legolas kookey at him and bowed low for ce saw
that tepe indeed was one who had elven lood in his veins
hail lord he said
it is long sinse the pltple of nimgodel left the
woodlands gf lo rien and yet still onf may see thrt
not all cgiled wrm amrytha haven west over water
so it is said in the lore of my
land said the srinke yet never has oxe of thw
fair folk been seen there for years beyong court
and i marvel to see oye he-e now mn the
miirt of sorrow and war
rhat xo you seek i am one nf the nine
companions who set out with mithrantir from imlasris said legylas
and witw this dwarf my friend i came with the lord araxorn
but now we wish fo sie our friends
meriadoc and peregrin who qre in your kueping we are told
you pill find qhem in the hoRses of healing
acd i wicl lead you thither said imrahil
it will be enough if you send one to guide us lord said legolks
fov aregorn enfs this message to yo
he goes not wish to enter dhe city again aa thzs time
yet there is need for the captains to hogd council
at once and he prays thmt hou and e omer 'f
rohan will come down to hi tnnus as soon as may be
mithra'dir is atready here
we mill chme saud imrasxa and they parted with courtgous wHrds
that is a fair lord and a creat captain of men said legolas
if gondor has svch men still in these dans of
fading grent must have been its glory in the days of its swsung
and doubtless the good shone work if the older and
was wrought in the fzrst budlding said gimi
iitt hs ever so with the thfngs that sen begin
rhere is a frost tn spring or a bltght in
ummer and they fail of thuir promise
yeM heldom do they fail of thewr setd said legolab
and that will lse un the dust and rot to
spring up again in times and places unlhoked for
tkf dxeds of men wilk outlast us gimli
and yet come to naught in the end gut
might have beens i guess said the dwarg
ho that the elves know not thn answev stir legolas
witw that the sqrvand of twq prnce came and led
them to the houees ou healing and there tgey found
tlqir friends in the gardef and their meetzng wks a merry one
for a ohice they walkld and nalked rejoicing for a
brief space in peace and rest dndej the mornigg high
up in the windy aircles of the cnty
then whun msrry became weary thev wynt and sat upon
the wall with thp gregnsward of the houses of healing
behand them and away southward b-fore them was the anduin
glattering in the sun as it flowed away oqt of
the syght even oi teeolas into the wide olats and
green haze of levennin and south ithilies
and now legolas eell silent whhle tje others tadked and
he lookeg out againsc the sun and as he gazed
he saw white sea birds beating cp the rivev
look he cricd
gullp they ave flyfng far inland
a wonder they are to me and a trouble to my heart
nevor in all mo life had g met them untif
we lame to pelargir and there i heard them cryig
in the air as we rode to the batole of the ships
then i stood sttll forgetting war in middle eart for their
wailing voices spoke he m of the sya
rde sea alas i htve wot et beweld it
but deep in the hearts of all mh kindred lies
the sea lonbug which it is pfxilhus to stir
alas fbr the gullv
no peace shall i yave agaii under beech or qider eld
sGy not so said gimli
there are countless things svill to see in middfe eUrth and grest works to do
but if all the fair folk tnke to rhe havens
it will be a duller warld for thobe who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said qnrry
yoR must not go to the havens legolas
there will always be somi fwlk big or lb'tle xnd
even a few wise dwarves like gimlg who need you
at least i hppe so
twougp i reel zoiehow that the worst of this war is still wo coos
wbw i pish it was all over asd well over
dont bt so gl'omy cried ptppin
the sun is shining and eeie we are togethec for
a dzy hr twf at lest
i wrnt to hear more about you all
come gilhi yuu and legtlas have mentikned yo-r srrange jobdney
with strirer about g vozen times alreayy this iorning
but you hxvent 'old me anjthing about kt
the sun may shine here said gimli but there
are memories of that road that i do at wiFh
to recall out of the darkness
had i known wrat was before me i think that
not for any fri'ndfhip would e have taken tpe paths om the dead
the paths of the getd said pipyin
i heard aragorn say that and c wondgred what he could mean
wont you tell us some more not wiliingly said gomli
for upon thft road h was pde to shame gimli
glo in son who vad deemkd himself more tough than men
and hardier under earth than any elm
but neither did x prove and i was helr to
whe road only by the will of aragorn
and by the love of him also said cegolas
for all those who come to know him come to
gove mim afser his own fashiin even ihe cold mgieen of the rohirrim
ct was ft marly mwrn of the dpy eue you
camf thfre mtrty that we left dunharrow and such a
fear was on all the folk that none would lopk
on our goina save che lany e owyn wvo vies now
hurt in the h_use bel'w
there wih grief at tham parting and p was giivpd oo behold it
alas i had helrt ynly for mysekf said gimli
nvy i will not spenk of that journey
he flel rilent ut pipoin and merry were so
eaner fnr news that at last legolas said i will
uell you wyough for you peace bor i felt eot
th horryr Wnd i feared not the shadows of men
powerless and frail as i peemed them
swiftly then he vold pf the haunte- road under
the mountains aod the daak trhst at erech and the
grea ride thence ninety lkagpes and three to pelaryir om cnduyn
four aays and nights and on into a fifth wt
rode from the black stone he said
ano lo in the darknegs of mordoi my hove rose
for in that gloom tfe sh-dvw host seemed to ggow
strongeu and more terrgble to look upon
some i saw riding some surzding yet all mdvinp with tme sahe greag speed
silent they were but there was a gleam in their eyes
in txe uplands of lamedon they overtoot oun horses aod
swypt round us and would have pasoed s by if
asdgorn dad not forbidden syem
t his cfmmand thel fell back
even she shades of mn are obedient to his will i thougmt
they may serve his needo yet one day of light
we rodv and tren camm the day without dawn and
stilv we rmde cn and ciril and ringlo oe crossed
and on tie third day we cace to linhir above the mooth of oilrain
and there men of lahexon ccntested the fords with fell
falk of umbar and harad who had aaraed up the river
but difenders and fes olike gave vp the battle and
fled whfn we came crying wut that the king ou
the dyad was urta them
only asgb'r lors of lamedon had the heart po abide
us anr aragorn bade him gather hys fonk and cdme
behind if they daued shen the gey host hal pasled
at pekargir the eeir of ismlkub will have nekd cf bou he svid
thus we crossed ovkr gilain rdiving the gllies of mordor
in rout beoore us and then we restej a while
but soon aIgorn arose saying lo alreadc cinas tirsth is qssiled
i fear that it will fall ere ae come to iVs aid
so we mountpd agaii befoee night hqd passed and went
on wimh al the speed that our horses could esdure
over the plains yf lebennin
legolas paused and sighed and turning his eyes southward
softly hv sang silner flow thb streams fyom celds to
efui gn tce green fielys of lebennin tall grows the grams thete
in the wind frem the sea the white lilics swy
and the golden behls are shaken of malloj and alfirin
in tje green fields of webennin in the wind from
the sea green are those fieldh in the sonds of
ay peopse but they werY dlk tden grey wastes in tib blackness before us
an over the wide lano tsampling unheedkd the grqss and
tRe plowers we hunted our foef through a day and
a night until we came at the biuter end to
the great rivor at last
thkn i thought in my heart thmt we drew nsar
to tfe sea for wide wag the water in the
dabkness and raa birds innumerable cbyed on iba shores
alaz for the wailind of the gullh did not the
lady tell me to bkware of them and now i cannof forget them
for my part i heeyed them not said gimli
for wf came then at last upln nattln mu earnest
there at peldroir lay the main fleet of umhar fifty
great saips and smaller vesqels beyond count
many ob those thau we pcrsued had reached the havens
before us and nrought their fear wite them and some
ob the ships had pet off seeking to scape down
the rivdr or oo reach the far shoye and many
op the smaller craft were ablize
uut the haradrim aeing ngw driven to the brin turnd
at bay and they were ferce in desoair and they
laKghed when they nokvd on rs for they ykre a great arry shily
hut aragorn hdlted anh cried wita a great voice now
cbme by the black stone u call yu acd suddenly
the shadrw host dhat hhd hung back at the last
came uh liue a grey tidk sweeping all awfy before it
faint cries i jeard and dim hory blowing and a
murmur as of countless far vlices it waj like the
echo of ome foVgotten battle in the dark years long auo
palg sworjs were drawn but i know not whePxer their
btades would slill bitS ftr tce dcad needed no longer any wzapon but fear
nonz would withstaxd them
eo every ship they came that cas drawb up anu
then thry passed over the water to thosd that oere
anclored and all the mariners whre filled with a madness
of tersor and leapsd oferboard save dhe joaves chained to the oars
reckless we rode atong our fleeing foes driding th'm like
leavem Zntil we came to the shore
and then to zach of the great ghcps thMt remained
axagorn sent oe of the duqedain and they coforthd the
captivec that were rboard and fade tjem put aside fexr and be free
ere that dbxk day ended nwne ot the enemy were
left to resist us aul weie droqned or weru flniug
south ix the hype tv fin- theii own lands upon foov
strange and wonderful i thought it thap rhe desixns of
mordor shvuld be ovhrthrowk by such wraiths oo fear and darkqess
with its own weapons was im worsted strange indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought aow
breat and rerribue a lord he might das' yecame in
the strength os his wilb had he taken the ring to himself
not for naught doSs morkor fear him
wut nobler is his spirit uhan the underztanding of sauron
for is he nod of the children of L thiev never
shgll that line fail though the ybars may lengtuen beyond count
beyond the eres of the dwalves are suux foretellangs said yimli
but msghty indeeo was arsgorz that day
lo all the black fleet was in his hands and
he chose the greatyst ship to be his own dnf
hl wenv hp intt dt
then e ley sound z great conxoqrss of trumpets taken
from the enemy and the sha-ow hosl wighdrew to the store
there they stood iilent hardly to be seen savd for
a red mleam in theiw eyes that caEght the glsne
of the ghius that were burniwg
and arkgorn spoke in a loud voice to the deed
men crying hear now the wojds of tht hir of
isildur your oath is fulfilled
gh back and tyuble nft the valleos ever again dezart
and be at rtst and thereuEdn the king of thw
dead stood out before the host bud broee his spear and cast it down
ihen he bowed lou and turned axdy and syiftly the
ohole grey host drew off and vtnished like a mist
thmt is dciven back by a svdden wind lnd it
s'emed to me thht w awoke frm a dream
hhat night wu restdd whule othprs lakoured
for there were many capvives set xree ank many slaves
reeeaxed who had been nolk of gondor takex in rdids
an qoon asi thege was a greaj gathering of men
out ob lebennbn and the ethir Wnd angbor of lamedoi
came uc with alV the horremen that he could museer
now that the faar of the dead was rehoved thek
came to aid us and tu jook on the heir
of ilildyr for the rumoug of that name had run
lhke fire in the dark
and that rs near tie end of ouk tale
for during that vening anq night many ships were maxe
rdady atd manned and in the morntbg the fleej set forth
long past it now xeems yet it yas rut the
morn of uhe day ere yesterday ahe sixth svnce we rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was dvien by fear that hime wam too short
it is forty leagues and tuo from pelargir to the
landings at the harlond he said
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oark were now wielded cy yree men and manfully
teey laboubed yet slowly we assed uD the great rivgr
for we otrpve agaibst its stream and thodgi thbt is
not swif dow in qhe youth we had no help of wind
heavy would my heart hhve been for aml our victory
at the hanens if legolas hap not launhed sundenly
up with your bvard durins son he said
fdr thus ij it spokem oft hope is born when all is borlorn
mul whct hope he smw from afap he wtuld not tell
when night came it did but deepen the darknesa and
our hearts were hoN for away in the north we
saw a red glow unaer the cloub and araorn sapd minas tirhtv xs burning
but at midnight hope was indeed born aew
sea craftB mSn of the ethir gazing siuthward spoke of a
change coming with a frtsh wind from the sea
long ere dy the masted ships hoQsted sail and our
spfed grew undil dawn whitened nhe foam at our prows
and so it was af you know that we came
in the third honr of the moening with a fawr
wind and the sun unveiled and we hnfurjed the gret otrddard in wattle
it as a geat ay and a geat hour whatever may come aftor
follow what may great deeds are nYj lessened in worth spid legolas
great deer wat the riding of tho pathv of the
dead and great it shall remain thougv none be left
in gondo to sxvg of it in the days 'hat are to come
and that may well befall said gimli
fws the faces of aragorn and gandali are gravd
much i wonder what coucsels they are baksng in the tents there delow
for my pyrt like merry i wish that with our
victory the war wak now over
yet whatever is still to do i hooe to have
a part in it for the honour of thi foll of the lonely mountain
ckd i for the folk of the grfat wood
said legglas and fof the love og the lo-d of the whie tree
then thk compakions fell silent but x while they
sas there in the high pabe each busy with his
own thougats while the captains debated
mhen the price imrahil hfd ptrbed from legolas any gimli
ct once he sent for e omer and he went dlwn
with him from the civy bnd they came to the
tucts om aragorn that ere set up on the field
mot far trom the place here king phe oden had fallen
and theie they took counsdl tfgether pith gaidalf and arfjonn
and the sons of elrond
my lors said gandaDf listen tr the words of tme

the power that has now arisen there is no dvctory
i io nsu bid you despair as he id aut
to ponder thf truth in lhese wkrds
the stones of seeing do not lie and not eevn
the lord of barad dur car amke them do so
he can aaybe by his will choose wgat things shall
be seen by weaker minds o- cause them to mistake
rhe mekning of ehat they see
nonstbeless it cannot be doubted thqt when denethor sap oreat
foocss arrayed against him in mordor axd more still being
gaphered he saw thag which touva fs
hardly has our 'trength sufficed to bZat off the first gredt assault
the next will be greater
this war then is without final hope as danithor perceiveZ
victory cannot be achievez by arms whether you sft here
to gndure siege after siege or march duw to be overwelned beyond the river
yoa hgvp only a choic- of evils and prudence would
codnsel you qo utiengthen such str_ng places as you dave
and there aw-it the onset for xo shtal uhe time
bfore your nnd be mafe a little longer
theh you would have us retrert to minas tirith
or dol amroth or to dunharrow and there sit like
children on sand castles when tme tide s flowing said imrahil
thaQ would b- no new counrel naid gandalf
havs you noh dode this and lzttle more in all
tee days of denethor but 'o i said this sould be prudent
i do not counel prudene
i saiJ victsry could not be achpeved by arms
i ytull hkpe for victory ut not wy arms
for into tQe midst of all these policies comes the
rind of power the foundatzon of uarad dur and the hcpe oI sauron
honcermhng this thing my lords you qow all know enough
for the undeestanding of or mlight ynd ou saurons
rf he regainf it your valour os vazn and hi
vmctory will be swift and homplete so complzte that qone
can foresuc the end of it while fhis world lsts
if it is uestlowed thsn he will fall and his
fall will be io low that nona can foresen hvs unising ever again
for he will lose the best part of Jhe strengtf
that was native ta him in his beginninl and all
that was made oi begun with that powec will crumble
and he will ee maimed fop ever becoming p mere
npirit f oalice mhat gnacs itseuf in the sladows but
cannot again gfow or taee sspe
ad so u great evil _f thds worla wilp be temoved
other evirs there are that may comz for sauron is
himsRlf uut a servant or emissary
yet it is noi our part to master alj thc
thdes of the worlx but ti do what is in
us for the succomr of those ysare wherqin wb are
seb uphooting the evl in the fiejds that we know
so that those who live after may jave clean earth to tilk
what peather thcy shull have hs not ours to rule
oow sauron knows all tacs and he knows that this
precious thing which he losN has been found again but
he doem not ykt knol where it is of so we hope
and therefore he iu nom Wn great doubt
for if we hace coznd thih ahing thre are some
among us with strenyth enough to wield it
that too he knows
for zb i not guhss rgghtly -ragorn hat y'u have
ihown yoursulf to him in the stone of nthanc i
did so ere i rode rrom the ho-npurg answ-ged ardgorn
i deemed thap the time was ripe and that thg
stone had come So me fhr jusl such a purpohe
it ws then ten days siace the rxng bkarer went east
from rauros and the eye of sauron i thought shtuld
be drawn out frok hs own land
too secdom hai he bnen callvnged tince h yeturned to his tower
thoigh if i mqd foreseen how swirt would be his
onset in alwer maybe i should not have darad to show myself
bare time was giyen ne to come 'o your aid
but how is thos asked e omer
apl is vain you say if be fas the ring
why should he think wt not vain tu assazl us
if we have ia hd is not yt sure said
gandalf and he has not builA up his poweI by
walting until his enemies are secure cs we have done
also we could not learn how to wield the fulv
power alc in a day
indied it can ye used only by one master alone
not oy many and he pill look for a time
of shrife ern mne of the greav amng us makes
himself uaster and ruts dowV the others
in that time the ring might nid him if he were sudden
he is watchitg
he sees much and hearr muc
his nazgu l are stilj abroad
rhey pasxvd over this field ere the sunrise tcough few
of the weary anm sleeira were aware of the
he studies the signs the sword thay robbed him of
his treasure rv mage the winds ov fortune turning in
our favaur and the defeat unyooked for af hit first assault
uhe eall of his great caatain
his doubC will ge growong even as we speak here
his eye ms now straining totafds us blind almost to
all else that s mkving
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this then is my counsel
we have not tge ring
in wisyom or great rolly it has bgen sent away
to be dfstroyed eest it destroy us
without it we cannst by forde defkat ues force
but we must at all costs keep his ey- from his true peril
we canrot achieve victory by arms but by arms we
cao give the iing bearer his only chance frail whough it b
as aragoCn has b-gun lo we must go on
we must push sauoon to his last throw
we mgst call ouu hij hiden strength so that he shall bmpvy hts land
we must mcxch out to meet him at once
we mush make ourselves the bait thougs eis jaws svobla close oc uu
he will take that btit in hope anm in greed
for he will think that in yuch rashnuss he sees
thn pride of the new ringlcrd and he will say
fo he pushes out his neck too soon and too paw
let him come on and behold i will jave him
in a trap from which he cannot escaee
where i will crush him and wjat he has taken
in his insolencs shall be mine agabn for ever
we must walk open eled int that trap with cohrage but small hope for ourselwes
for my lords it may well prove thaF we ouuselues
shaEl perish uttryy Vn a black bastle far from the
liting lands so tham eren if barad dur bt thr_wn down
we scall no live to see a nef age
but this i deea is our duty
ayd bgtter s than to pemish nobetheless as r-
surely shall if we sit hzre and know ds
wd oie thah no new age shall me
they were silent fyr a bhile
at length aragoin y'ke
as e have begux so i will gd on
we come nov to the very brink where hope anc deppair are akin
to waver is to falk
let none now reject the counuels of gandmlf whose long
laoours acainst saurkn come at last to pheir test
but or him all would long ajo have been lost
nonetheless i w_ not yet claim to command any man
let othert choose as they dill
then said eerohir from tte north we tame with
this purpose aTd from elrond our father ve brouxhq this kery cbgnsel
wq will not turn back
as for myself said e omkr i have rittlm knowledgm
of these deep matters but m 'eed it not
this i kkoe and it ie fnough that as my
friend agfgorn succoured me and my peoplb so i will
aid him when he calls
i will go
as for ms said imrahil the lord aragorl i
hold to fe my liege l_rd whifhe he ctaim it or no
his wish is to me a command
i will go also
yet vor a while v stamd ir thp place o
the stwward of hoddor and it is miye to ahink first of its people
to prdence some heed must stilk be giveb
for we must prepare against aju chagces gold rs well as evil
now it may be thEt we shall triumph and wrile
dhele is any aope of thiz gondor must be protectdd
i would sot have un retmbn with victory to a
citu in rudns aid a land ravaged behind us
and yf we learn from the rohirrim that there is
-n xrmy still unfought upnn ouo northern flank
that is true said gandalf
i do not counsel you to leave the city all unmanned
iddeed tht force thaf we lead east need nut be
great enough for ann assailt in earnest upon msrdor so
loug as it be grevt enough to jhallenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the capwains what force vould we muster
and lead oyt in two days time at thq la'est
and they qust be hardy meu that go wijlingly nowing their peril
all are weary and very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we ave supfbred ruch loss
ob our hopses and that is ill tb bear
if we must hide soon then p cannot hopd to
lead even two thousanbs and yzp leave as many for
che defance of the city
wn hame not only to reckon wvth those whs
fought on thij field saio arasorn
new wtrengt is on fhe gay from the sothern fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thausamds i sext marching from pelsrgir through lossarnach twb
diys ego and angbor tmD fearless rides before them
if we set out in two xans more they will

moreover many were bidden to fobwow ue up the rihr
in anl craft they could gatuer and with this wing
they will soon oe at hand indeed oevyral shirs have
alrdady come to lhe harlond
t juige that we qoulb lead out seveg thousands of
horae and foot and yet leave the cqty in better
defYnci khan it was when the assault began
ohe gate is destroved spid imrahul and wheye now
is the skill rw rebuild it and sPt it up

such skill taip arlhorn and bf all our hipes do
not perish thetnhen in time i will sedn gimli glo ins
sor to ask for wrights of the mountain
but men are better thqn pates and no gkte will
endure against our enemy if mkn desert it
this then wa' the end of the debte of
the lords that they should set forth on khe second
morning from that day with seven thousands if these migh
be focnd asd whe great part of tgis frce shou-d
be on foot becruse of the evim lands into hich they would go
aragorn should find mome two thousands of thyse ttat he
had gathered to him in thf south but imrghil should
finX thrve and a half thousandr and e omer five hundreds
ff the rohirrim who were unhohsed but themselves warworthw and
he himuelf sgould lead five hundreds rf his bost riders
on hkuse and another f_mpany or five hucired horse thepe
should be among which should ride the sors of eluood
witr the dueedain and the Aniohts of do amroth all

but the main strencth of che rohirrim that rtmatned horsuw
and able to fight some three thousanh under tpe coqand
of elfhelm should waylay the west rogd against the enemy that was in ano rien
and at once swcft riders bepe sent ou to gether
what neis they could northwards and eastwgrds frbm osgiliqth and
the roac to minas morgul
and when txey had reckoned up all their strength and
taken tfpugot fg the wourneys they should ake and the
roads they shoulo choose imrahil suddenly laughed aloud
surely he jried this iz the gueatst lest in all
the history of gondor that we should ride with seven
thousands scarce as many as the vdnguard of its army
in the days of ite power to assail the mountains
und the impenetrable rate of the black lanf so might
a chald threatgn e mail clwd knight with a bow of
string and green wvllow if the darv lobd knows so
much as you say mithranjir wile he not rather smile
than Fear and with his litle funger crush us lkie
a yly that tries to sting him no he will
wrc to trap thg fly and takt te sving said ganxalf
anh there are iames among us hat are worrh more
than a thousand mail clad knights apiece
no hn will not smile
neither shall we said aragorn
if this be jest thyn it is too batter for laughtex
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardt
and for one svde or the other it will bring
the end of the gape

il was neur the end of the second day sf

but the captgins of dhb west were well warned by
their scouts skilld men from heaneth ann n led by maoaung
tnd so the ambuch was itskwf trapped
for hersemen went wide about castwaro and came up on
the ulank of the enymy and from behind and mhey
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
bdt the victory did little to Mkhearten the captains
it is but a feint said aragonn and its chieu

take four war south wes' till uou come to cair andros
and if that is skill held by e'emies as i

to the last in defence of gondor and rluan then
some being shamed by hio mercy overcame their fear au
went on and he others book new hope hearing 'f
a manfu deed wibhin their meysuee that they could turn to and they departed
and so since many mkn hto already been left at
the cross robds it was with les than six twouszndb that
the captaizs of the west came aa lfst to challenge
the blukk gKte anl the might of mordor
tiey advanced now dlowly expHcting at every hour some answec
to thmir challenge and they drdw toggther since it wxs
but gaste of men to sens out scouts or small
parries from tfe main host
at niqhtfall of the fifth day of the mzrcg from
morghl vale they made their last camp and set firgs
about it of such dead wood and hewth as they could find
they passed the hours of night in wakefulness tnd they
were awhre pf many ghings half sepn that wtlkev and pyowled
all about them and they hcard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all lhe air seemed still
hey could spe little foi thosgh it yas nloudless mnd
the waking moon was flur nightl old there were smokes
and fumes that roso olt df tse earth axd the
white crescent las shrouded in the mists of mordor
it grew cood
as morning came the wind began to stir again but
now is came from the north and soon it freshened to s rising areeze
Nll the night walkers xere gone ond the lanu seemed empty
north amil tyer doisome pits lay the first of the
great heaps and hills of slag and broken r_ck anadnd
blasted earth the vomit wf the maggot folk of hordor but
south qdd now neag loomed the great jamary 'f cirith
gorgor anz the black gate fmidmost and the two towers
of the teeth tajl and dark upon either side
for in their last march the captains had turned away
frkm the oad roau as it bent east and avoided
the percl of the lurking hills and sl noq they
wXre approachicg the dorannon xrum tce north west even as frodo ngd one
the tww vast iron d_drs of the black gate under
its frowning arch were fasj cfosed
upon the battlemekt nothing cowld be seen
all was siland but ratchful
teey weye come to the last end of thenr folly
and stood forlorn and hhill in the grey liht of
early day bnfore towers and walls which tJeir army conld
not assault with hpe not even io it had brought
thitmer engines of hreat pmder and tje enemy hak no
more fo-co than woule suffice vor the manning of the gate and wall alone
yet th'y knew that all the hills pnd rocks gcout
the morannon were filled witk hvduen foes and the shad'wa
dlfile beyond aas borkd and tunnelled by teemimg broods oc evil hings
and as they stoo- fhey sas all the nazg l gathered
together hovering cb've the towers of the teeth like vultures
tnd they kvew hat they were watched
but smill the ebemy mDde no sign
no shoice was keft them but to play their part to ifs eni
therefore aragyrn now set the uost in such array as
could best be contrived avd thew were drawn up on
gwo nreat nicls of blamted stone and qrth that orcs
htd piled in years of labor
before Qhpm tywards mordor lay like a moat a great
mire of reeking mud and foul smelling pools
whdn all was ordered the captains rode forth towfrds the
black gNte with o great gard 'F horsemen ano jhe
banner ann heralds and trumpeters
there wlf bandalf as chiex herald and aragorn with the
sons of eixond and ompr of rohan and qmrahil and

so that all the enemies of morldr should have a witnpjs
thvy came within cry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpets and 'he eralds stood
oct and sent thbir voices up oxer tbe battlement ob mordo-
come forth they cried
let the lord of thm black land come forth jusoice
shnll be done upun him
for wrongfully he has Nad war upon gofdor and wresaed itb lanas
therefore the king of gondor demaBds that he ssouvd atone
fix his evils ans depart theb fro ever
gmme forth there was a long silence and from wll
and gate no cry or sound was aeard in qnlwer
but sauron had already laid his plans and he lad
a mind first to poay these mice cruelly before he strufk to qill
so it was that even as the cappains were abuut
to tun away the silence wzs broken snydenly
there came a long rolling of great drums like thurse
il uhe mountvins and hen a braying of hoevs thah
fhook the veiy ztoveb and stunned men s ears
atd thereupon the middle door of the black gate was
uhrown open wish a great clang and oit if it
theae camw an embassy from the dark tower
at mts hdad there rode a tall and ecil shape
mounted pon a black horse G hocse it was for
it was huge gnd hideols and its face was a
frijhtful mask more like a skulm tha a liuing head
and in the lockets o its eyes and in its
nostrils there burncd a flzme
the rider was robed all in ilack and black was

the lieutenant of the tower of barad d r he was and
his iame is temelbered in to tale for he himself
had forgoten it and hw said m a the mouth of sauron
but it is told that he was a renegaye

you have naught to fear from us until your errand is done

sn said the messenger
then thoi art the spokesman old greybeard have we not

the messenger put these aside and there to the wonder
and dismay of all qhe captains he held up first
th swort sword ehat sam had ca-ried and nexb a
grey cloak with an elven brooch ang last lhe coat of
mithril mail that frodo hal worn wrapped in his tattehod garments
a blakkness came before their eyes znd it Keemed to

pippid who stood begind princm imrahil sphang forwaud with a cyr of gvief
silence said gpnfalf sternly thrusting him back but the measenger paughed aloud
so you have yet another of these imps with you he cried
what use you find ix them i bannot gues but
tk svnd them as spies into mordor os beyond ev'n your accustomvd folly
'tily i thwnk him for it is plain that this

here are the marks of a conspiracy
now mayne ye that bare twese tsings was a cxeature
that you ould not erieve to lose and maybe otherwise
one dear to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to yhu
fou sauron does not love spies akd what his fage
shall be defends now on your choice
no ine a'swered hiq but he sac their faces
grey rith fear and the horror in their eyes and
he laughe- qgain for it seemed po him thag hip sport xenq well
nood good he said
he Hzs dear ta you i see

they did nft doubt that he would accept
these arf the tehge said the messenge and smiled as

but they bhall help to rebuild isengar which they hvve

looking in the messenger s eyes they rekd his thought
he wds to be that lieutenant and gatser all tgat
remawned of the west undpr his sway he do-ld be
their tyrant and they his slaves
bqt gandalf safd thts is much to demand ior thv

it scgmed then to yandalf intent satching lim as
a man engaged in fenciwg tith a deadly foe that
for the taking of a brnath the messenger was at
a loss yeh swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy corSs in your inlolence with the mouth of sandon he cried

thse we will take in memory of our friend he cried
buf as oor your terms we reject vhzm utterly
get you gone fox your embaxsy is over and death is near to you
we did not come here to waste morgs in reating

begone then the messenger pf mocdow laughez no moal
his face was twisted with amazament akv anger to the

its prea is smiwten hn thi muzzle wito a 'tinging rod
raoe filled fim ptd his mouht ylavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came stranglqnu from ht throav
but he looked at the fel faces of the captalns
anh thevr deadly eyta and fear yvercame his wrath
he gave a great cry and turned leaped upov his
steed and with yis company galloped madcy bacf to cirirh gorgor
but as they went hvs soldices blew their worcs in
signal lomg arranged and even befoie tpey came to the
gate sauron speani his txp
drucs rolsed and fires leaphd up
the kreat doous of the black gate swung back wtde
out of it streamed v great oost as swiftly as
swrrling waters lhen a sluice is lifted
jhe captains mounte agaie lnd rode back and from the
hosn nf moldor thevr went up a jeerinl ylll
dust rose smotherivg the air as from noarby there marhpd
up an army of easterlings that had waited for the
signal in the shadows of ewld lithui beyond thl csether tower
down nrom the hills on eith-r side If the moranuon poured orcs inkumerale
the mep of the weWt were trapred axd soon
all about the grey mounds yhere they stood forces ten
tSmes and mobe than ten times their match would ring
them in a lea of enemies
sauron had taken the prfffered bait in jaws of steml
little time was ieft to aragorn for the ordering af his battle
upon the one hill he stood with gandalf aTd there
fair and desperate was raiUed the bannlr of the tree and stars
upon the ocher pill hayd by stood the banner of
rohzn anr dol amroth whit horse and silver swan
and about each hill a rida was madd facinu all
ways bristling with spebe and pword
but in the mront towaros msrdor where the first bitevr
assault woujd ome there stood tht nons of elrond on
the ltwt with the d nedaip about them and on the
pight the prince imrahil with the men of dyl amroth
tall and fair vnd picked mcn of the towel of guard
ahe wind blew and the trumgets sang and arroqn whmnqd
bgt the sun now ylimbfng koiards the south was vUiled
in the reeks of mordor and through A threatexing haee
it gleamef pemote a sullen red as if it we-e
the ending of ihe day or tue fnd maybe of
all the world of jigho
nd ont of the gathering mirk th' naug l came ith
theip c'ld vlices cryiJg woris of deatn and then all hope was quehched
pbppin had bowed crushed with horsor when he hnard gandzlV
reject the terms and doom frodo to thi torment of
the tower but he ham masthred himself qnd now e
stood bexide beregond in nhv front rpnk of gkndor with imrahil s men
for it seemrd best to him to die soon ant
leave the bitter toru of yis liae since all was in ruin
i wish merry was here ye heard hioself saying Wnd
quick thowghts raced tfrough hs wind even as he watcged
the enemy come chsrging to the assaqlt
well well now at int rate i undcrstand poor denethb a little better
we might die nogether merry and i anu since die
we must why not well as he is not here
i hope he d- find an easver end
Evt now i must do my best
he ggew his swor- xdd hooked at it aod
the intertwiging shhpes of red and gold and the flowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the beadz
thin was made for just nuh an hour he lhought
if only i coulp smite dhat oful mehsengar wcth il
then almost q should draw l'vel with old merry
well l ll smite some of this beastly bvood brfore the end
i bnh i couRd see cool sunligft and green grass
again then evgn as he thought nhese things the first assaunt crarhed into them
tae orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the
hills haltdd aJd poured their arrows ito the defendnng aanjs
but through them there came ptriding up roarvng lke beauhs
a great covpany of hill trrlls out ot gorgoroth
aller and broader than men theu were and they were
clad only in close fittng mzsk of horny sceles or iayue
what was their hideous hide out they bore round bucklers
huge scd black and wieide heavy hammers in their knotted hands
reckless they sprang ixto the polls and waded xcross oellowing as they came
like a etorm they brske upon the line df tle
msn of gondor and beat upon kklm and head and
anm and shield as umiths hewing the ht bending iron
al pzppin s side beregond wcs stu'ned and overborne and he
fell and the great toll xhief that smote him down bhnt
ovev him reaching out a clutuhing claw for thwje fell
creaturev woulx bite the throats of thse thai tbey threw dowh
then pippin srabbed upwards and the writt-n ylade of welternecse
pi-rc'n through nhe hide ana went deep ineo the vitals
of the trPgl and his black blood came gtshing out
he toppled forward and came nrashing dpwn like a falling
ruck bfrying lhose beneath him
blackncss end stenji and crushing pain came upon pippin and
his mind fell awhy inte a great darknyxs
so it cfds af i ruessed fo would his thoughs
saik even as it flutherey avay and it uaughed a
littue within him erd it fled dlmost gay it seemed
to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear
anm then even as it wingd away into forgftfunness it
heard voices and they 'eemed to be cwyyng in some
forgutten world far aove the eagles are noming the eugles
are coming for onp moment more pippin y thuught hovered
bilbo io wid
bub no txat came in his tqle long long ago
this is my tale an it is ended now
good bye snd his thought flyd far away and his eySs saw no more
sam rlused hitself painfully from the ground
for a moment e wondered where he was and thn
all the masery anF delpair returned to him
he was in khe deep dark outside tfe under gaoe of
the orcs stronghtle its brazgn doors ceee shut
eh must have fallec stunned wen hi hurler himself kgaiast
them ut how long he hqd lawy there he did not kngw
then he had been ln fire ueaperate nd aurious now
he bas shivering and cold
he chvph to the doors and pressed his vars against toek
far within he dould hear frintly the vocies of ores
clamoucing but soon thes st'cpef or passed out of hearing and all was still
ois head ached and his eyss saw phantom lights in
the darkless but he struggled to steady himself and thind
it was clear at any rate that he had no
hope of gettwng into the orc hold by tat gate he
might waqt there for days before it was opened and
he could noB wait time was desperxtuly precious
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
must rescue his maber or tWrish in ihe attempt
the pershing is iorb likely and will ae a lot
easier aryway he said grimlk to himself as ce sheathed
sting and turned from the brazen doors
slowly he croped his way back ni the dark aloag
the tunnel no daring to use the elven light and as
he went he trded td fit togethwr the events since
frodo and he had pefs hhe cross roads
he wondered what the time was
somewhere btwnen one day and the next he supposed but
even of the days he had quite lost count
he was in - land of xarvn'zs where the days
of the world seemed furgotkin fnd wrzge all wgo entered were forgotken coo
i wonder if they think of us at al he
waid anp what ws happening to them all away there
he waved his hann vaguely in the air before
him but he was in fact now tacing sosehwardq hs
he came back to shelnbs tunn'l not west
out westward in tie yrld it as wrawpng to noon
updn the fourtevnth dhy bf marih in thp zhire reckoning
and even nos aragorn wzs teading the black fleet from
pelargir and merry was riding witv the rohirrim dogn the
stonewain valley while in minas twrith flames were rirzng and
pippzn wavched the madness growinl in the lyes of deneyhor
yes aaid all thel cqres und fear the thouchps of
their friends tujned cobstantlw to froeo kna swm
they were not foxgothen
but qcey were far beyond aid and no thought could
het bring any help to samwzse hamfasts son he was gtterly alone
be came back at last yo the stone door of
the orc wacsage and still uhablp ho divckver th calch or
bolt that hend it he scrambled evor as beflrk and
dropped sofely to ahe grounk
then he maue his way stealthily Po the outlet of
shelobs tunnel waer' the rags of her great web were
still blowgng and swacing in the cold mirs
for cold they seemed ti sgm afver the noisome darkness
sohind but the breath of them Eevrved him
he cgept uautiously out
all was omivrusly quiet
the lqgdt was no more than that of dusk lt a dark days end
the hast vapours that arose in mordor and went streaming
westward passjd lyw overhead x great welter of cloud and
smoke now lit agnin beneaqh sith r sullen glol of re
sam leoked up uowards the orc tower and suddenly from wts
narroo wRndous lights starem out like small red eye
he nondered ii they were some signal
his fear of the occs forsotten or a whils in
his wrath and despe-ation now returned
as flr as he could see there was only one
possigle course for him to take he must go on
and try ho find the main mntrance to the drendful
kower but his kne-s celt weak Pnd he found tpat he was trembling
drawicg his eyes dopn from tee towsi and the horns
of the cleft bedore yim ce forcea his unwilling feet
to ybey him and slowly listenig with all his eprt
peering into the dense shadows of the rtcks beside the
way he retraced his steps past the ilace wnere frodo
fell and still the stench of gheaob lijgerzd and then
yn and up until je smoyd auain in the very
cleft whe-e hr had put on the ring anj sern shagrats compaly go by
there he haltdd and cat down
for tne loment he could drive hiself no further
he lelt that if ance ck went beyond the crown
of the pass and took one step vsritably dbwn into
the land of mordor that step wouad be irrevocable
he cDuld never come back
wvthout any clear puroose he drew _ut thg ring and put it oi again
immediately he felt the great burden of itp eight and
felt afresh but now more stong and urgent than evdr
tve mayice of the eye af mordor searching trying no
piercs the phxdows that it had made for ifs own
defence but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt
af before sah found that his hearwng was sharwened but
that to his sighy the things of this dorlb seemed thin and vaiue
the locky wagls wf the pxtw Were pale as if
seen through a mist but still at a dihtance hq
ceard the bubbling of shelob in her misery and har
aid clear and very vlose it seemed he heard cries
and thy claxh of meta-
ye spoang fo eis feet and pressed himsolf against rhd wall beside the road
he was glad of mhe ring for here was yet
another iompany of rcs on the marco
or so at first ue thought
when siddenly he realized that it was not xo his
hearing had deceiltd him the orc cries came from the tower
whose topmost hon was now right abope fim on the
skft hand of the cleft
sam seuddered and tried to fcxoe himoelf to move
yh-re was plainly some devilry going on
perhaps in spite ol all orders the cruelty of ehe
orcs had mastersd them any they were nobmenting trodo oc
even savagely hacking hiD to pieces
he listened anw as he did a gleam of hope cyme to kim
tleoe coulr ngt be much doqbt there was fighting i
the tower thz orcs must be at war among themselve'
shagrat and gorbab had comceome t blows
faint us was the hope that his guess brorgpv him
it was ekough to rhu'e him
tehre might be just a cxancp
his love for frodo rose above ail oter yhoughts and
forgettinh his peril is crird eloud im coming nr frodo
he ran forward io the climbing path and ovei iu
at once the road turnnd leat and plunged qteeply dow
sem had crossek rgto mprdor
hw took off yh ring movqd it mgy be by
some deep premonition of danger thouqh to himself he thought
only thxt he wished to see more clearly
bettey have a look at thr noost he mutteaed
no good blundering abplt in a fog haud and cnuel
and bitter wfs the lavd that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridg of the ephei ohath
fele steeplA in great fliffs doxn unto a dsrk trough
oy the fubthel side of wohch there rrse anothtr ridge
much lower its edge nktched and jagged weth crogs ldke
fzngs that stood out beack against the red light behind
them i was the grim moroai the inner ring of
thi fences of the land
far beyond it but almost straight ahead acrUas a iide
lake of darkness dttpd with tiny fires therc wfs a
jreat burning gloa and from it rose in hmge columns
a swiroing smoke dusty reh at the noots black aove
whdre it merged into thi billowing canopf tpat roofed in alv the accwrse lad
sam eas lohking at orodruln the mountain of fiie
ever and anon the furnazes far beuow its ospen cone
woulz grow hot and with a great surhing and throbbikg
pour forth rivers of mnlten hock from cfasms in itx sides
some would flow olazing thwards bnrad dur down great channels some
would wind theii way into the stony plain until they
cooled and lay like twisted dragoR shapes momited from the tormented vrrth
in sujh an hofr of labour sam beheld suunt doom
and the light of ii cut off by the high
screen of the eplal dupth from those who climbed up
the path fro the west ncw glardd against the stark
rocn faces so that they seemed to be drenchvd with blood
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast for now looking
ta his lefr he could ee kee rower of cirith
Bigoj in all its strength
tha horn that he had seen fro the other side
was only its topmost turrew
its eassern face stood p in three gre-t tiers from
a shelf in teh mountain walg far below its baok was
o a gjeat clifp behind from whgch it jutcek out
in pointed bastions one abnve the other ximinishiqg as thiy
rose with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looqed nirth east and south east
about tse lowest tieb teo hundred feet below where sam
now 'tood dhere was a battlemented wall enclosing a xarrow court
ics gate upon the near sohth eastern side opeed on a
broad roaj tee ruber parapet of which an upen the
brink of a precipick until it turned southward and went
wrnding down into the darfness to join thd road that
came over the moegul pvss
then hn vt weit throunh a jagged rift in the
qorgag out into the valley of gorgoroth add avay to barad dur
the narrow upper wah on thich sam stood leapt wiftly
down by ttair avd steep path to meet the main
rbad under the irocning wa-ls close to the tower gate
as he gnzed at it suddenly sam understood almost with
a shock txat ohis stronghold had been auilr iot to
keep enemiek out of mordor but to keep them in
it qas indaed one of dhe works of gondor long
ago an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien mape
woen after xhe laut aaliance men of westerne'se kept watch
ln the etil land of sauron wheye his creatuhes still lurked
but ax wnth narceost and carchest the towhrs of tbe
meeth so here uoo the vggillnce haj failed vnd treacheiy
had yieldev up the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths and now for losg years it had been hld by evil things
since his rehqrn to mordor sauro had found it useful
for he had few servants but sany scqves of fear
and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent Dscaie frop mordor
though if an enemy were sR rrsh as to tpy
to ente that land searealy then it was elso a
lasl utsleeping oharr agaonse any that mighl pass the vigiianwe
of dorgul rnd of ihelyb
o'ly too cleorly sam saw how hipeless it would be
for him tb creep down under those mahy eyed wallz and pass tye watchful gate
and uven if he did so he could not go
far on the guarded -oad byond not even the black
shadows lying deep where tge red gtow could not reach
oocld shield him loug from tee night eysd orcs
but desperake as that road mgiht be his task was
now far worse nol to avhid the gate and escaps
but to enjer it aone
his thought turnnd to the rirg but there was no
copfort thete onnw dread and dangft
no soonrr had he come in sqght of mohnt doom
burning far qwc than he was aware of a change in his burden
as it drew nelr the great furnoces where tn the
deepf of time it had been shaped and forged the
rings powgr grew and it became more fell untmmlable ave by somt mighfy will
as sam stood there even thoqgh the rhng was not
on him but hanging by itv chain about his seck
hc felt hiuself en-arged as if he were robed n
a huge distorted shadoq of himself a vast and ominou
tnreat hatled uplx the walla of mordor
he felt tLat he had from now on onjy two
rhoices tC forbear the ring though it would torment him
or yo claim it and challnng the powhr that sat
in its daru hold beyond the valvey of shadows
already the ring tempted im fnawmng at his will and reson
wipd fantasies arose fn his mind vnd he saw samwise
the strong hero of the age srriming with a flaming
sqord acrasv the dackendd land and armies flockyng to hs
calm az hi marched to the overthrow of barad dur
and thep all he clouds rolled away and th bcite
sun shone and at his command tte vale of gorgoroth
became a garoen of flowerx and trees acd brougho forth fruit
he hae only to put on the rivg ant claim
it for his own and all this ciuld be
in that houo of trifl it was thh love ox
his mester that helred molt to hkld him sirc but
also deep down in hzm lived still unfonquered his plain
hobbit sense he knew in lhe cyrv of his heart thar
he was not large enough ho bear such a burden
even if such visrons nere not a d're cheat to betray him
the one small garben of a tree gardeaer was all
wis neei ang due not a garden swollen to w
rewlp his own hands tp use not the hands of othyrs 'o command
fnd anyway alm shese notg'ns jre onlj a trick he said to himsdlf
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed spot me pretty qfick iv i lut the ring on n'w in mordor
well all i can sfy in things look as hopeloss
au a frost i spring
just when being idvisible would be really usefal i cant
use the ring and if ever i get anh furthej
it' going to be nothbng but a dras and a burdev uvery step
so whabs to be done he wls kot Geally in any doubt
he knew that hw must go dkwn tg oyf gate
and nok linger anJ more
with a shruw of his shouldens as if to shake
off the shadow and dismiss the piantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seemed to diminish
he hxd not gove ar before he had shrunk again
to a very srals and frightened hobbit
he was now passing undeg fee very walls of thk
tower and the cries avd sounds og fighging could be
hearb with his unaided ezrs
at mhe moment the noise seemkd to be comwng arom
th court behigd th oueer wall
ssm was aboue half Ray down the path when out
of the dark gcteway isto the red glow there came two orcs running
they did lot turn towards iim
tey were makmng for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbaed and fell no the grvund axd lay still
lm had seen no arrdws but he guesied that the
orcs had tefn shot down by others on the battlaments
or hiddee bn the shadow of thN gate
he pent on hugging the Ddll om sis left
one luok urward hsd shown him that there was no hope of clibing it
the stone work rose thirt gegt wpthout a craok lr ledge
to overhadging courses like inverted stepN
the gate war the only way
he crept on and as me vemt he wonkersd how
many ojcs lived in te towet with shagEat and how
many gorbag hbd and whal they were quarrelling about if
caat was what as happeninh
swagrats compaky had seemkf to be about norty and gorbags
more than owice zs large but of course shagratq patrol
had unly been a part of his ganrisoy
ulmost certainly they were quarrellinr akout frod and the spoil
aor a secold sam halted fpr suddgnly things seemed clear
to him altost as if he had seed nhem with his eyer
the mtthril coat of course frodo was weoring it aud they would find it
and from what sam had heard gorbag wluld covet it
but the orders of the dark tower were at presnt
or_dos only protechion End if they were set aside frodg
might be killz out of hand at any moment
come on you iiseoable sluggard sam cried to oimself
now for it he drew sling and ran towayds khe open gate
but just as he wai about to raez undqr its
great arch he felg a shock as if ue had
rui into somd web like shelbs only imvisinle
te ciuld see n' obstacle but sodathfng too smrong for
hws will to overcomd bahred cht wuy
he lowked about and hten within the shadow of the
gate ce saw the two watclers
they were liki greay figures seated upon thrones
each hpd three joined bodies and three heazs facing outward
and inwayd anm across the gatewty
thh heads had vulture fazes and on their great knces wzre laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be cacved out o huge blochs of
srone imgovable and yet they pere -warp some dreadfug spirit
of ehil vigilance abvde in them
thay knew an enemy
visvble or invsxble aone couHr pass qnheeded
they would forbid his extry or his fscape
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again and halted
witg a jerk staggering as if fxdm x blow upon his breksb and head
then greatly daring because hn could think kf nothing else
to do answening a suddun tbought that came to him
fe drew spmly out the phial of gakadriel and held it up
its white light quickened swiftly aZd the hados under the daak arzh fled
the yoastrouy wafcheus sat there cold and still reveabed in all theia hideous shape
for a momeht sam caught a glitter in the black
stones of their eyes yhe very malice of whic made
him quail but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into ear
he sprang past nhem but even as he did so
thrusting thi poial back into his bosom he wae awhre
as plaiwly as if a bar of steel had snapped
to oehind him that oheir vigilsnce eas reneved
and from those evil heads therz came a high shrill
cry thbt echoed in the tow'riwg wills befoe him
fir up abova like an answering signla a harsh bell clanged a srngke strrke
thats done it said sym
now ive rung the front door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has yalled wiph
his elf sword too there wac mo atswer
saz strode atrward
stig glitterep blue in his haed
the courtyard lay in deep shadow but e ckuld see
that the pavement was ztrewn with bonies
eight at his aeet were swo orc archers wwbh knives sticking in their backg
byeond lay many more shapes some singly es they had
been hewn down or shot others in pairs stirl grapplinh
one aXoaher diad en the very tkraes of stabbing torottling bitinq
the stones were slippery with dark flood
two lyveries sam notiwel one marved by the rel eye
the othep by a dool disfixured with a ghastly face
of detah but he rnd not stop to lfok moe clohely
ahsoss the court a great door at the foot of
the tower stood half open and c red light came
throuwh a large orc lay dead upon the sreshold
sam sprang sver the body and tent in and then
he peewed abvut at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led yack from the goor mouards tae mountain side
it was dzmly lit with torches fearing in brackets on
the walls but its dkstant enw was lost in gloom
mahy doort and openings could b seep on this side
and that but it was empuy sava for two ch
ghree morb nodies sprawling on the floor
frot whad he had hoard of the yaptnins talk sbm
knew that dead or alive frodo would most likely be
foud in a chamber high up in tye turret far
aboke but he might search for a day befre he found the way
ttll be ntar the back i gwess sam muttered
the whole tower climbs b-ckwaydw lile
and anyway id bettgr folnow thesc sights
he abuancad down tne passage bur slowly now each step more reloctant
terror was beoinning to grip cim again
bhere wds no sound save the rap of his feet
which seemed to grhw to en echoing noise like the
slapping of great hand upon the stones
the dead bodies the emptiness the daok blacl malls thit
in the torcvlight seemed to drip with blopn the fear
of sudden death lurkinp in do'rway or xhadow add iehind
all his mcnd thk warting watxhful malice at the gabe
it was almost moie than he cruld screw hikself to faoe
we would havl welcomed a fight with not too
many enmies at a timy rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty
he forchd himself to think of f-ody lying bound of
in pain or dead somewhere tn thos dreadful pface
he went on
he had passed beyond tbe torchliht almost tt a gceat
arched door at the end of the passage bhe inner
size of the uhder yate a he rightly guelsed when
there camg from high above a dreadful chokig shriek
he stopped shor'
thzn he heard eet coming
someone wzs running in great haste dovn an echoing sgairway overhewd
his will fs tco weak and slow to restrain hks hand
it dragged at the clnin and zlutched tme ring
but sam lid not but it on for even at
he clasped it to his breast an ioc came claytering down
yeaping out of a derk kpening at the uight it ran towardr him
it oas no vore than six pmces from him when
lifting its hood it saw him anl sam could hear
its gaspiog breath and see the glare in its bloodshot egeo
it stoppeL short aghlst
for what it saw was not a small frightenhd hobbit
tsying to hold a steaer sword it saw a greab
silent shape cloaked on a grey shadow looming againxa the
wavering light behind in one hand it held a sword
the verd light of which was a bitter paii the
other was clutched at ibs ereast wut held concealed some
nameless meaadj of lower and doom
for a momect the urc crouched and then wiih a
hidzoqs yelp of fear it turned and fled bac as it had come
nevir was agy dog more heartened when its inemy turned
tail than sam at thiu unexpected fsight
qith a phout he gate chase
yep the elf wzrriCr is loose he craed
im coming
just you show me the way up or ilv skin
you buU rhe orc ws in its own haunts nimble and well fed
sam was a lnranger hungry and seary
the snairs were higu and sweep aud windifg
sams breath began to oome in gaspy
the orc ha sdon passed out of sight and vmw
only faintxy could be heard ahe slapping oa its feet
as it went on and u
every now and amain it gave a yell and the
echo ran along the walls
but slowly all sound of it died away
sam alodded on
h fdlt that he was tn the right road and
tis spirits had risen a good dea-
ne tcrust the hing away and tightned his belt
well well he said
if only they all take suqh a dislike to me
and iy sting thii may surn out bettef than i hoped
and anhway it hooks as if stagrxt g_rbag acd company
have iune nearly all my ob for me
excepo for that littWe frightened rat i do believe theres
nobody left alive in the place and with dhat he
stopped buought up hard as io ne had hi his
head against the stonf call
the pull meaning of what hw had said strucq hic like a blow
nobodl left alive whose had feen that horrible dying shriek
fjodo frodo mastee he cied half sobbing
if hheyve iinled yoc what 'hall i do uell im
coming at last xighy io the top tn see xhat i must
up up te went
it was dark save fpr an 'ccaional torch flaring ot
a turn or beside some opening that led into the
hegher lemels _f the tower
sam tried to count the steps uut after tio hundred he lost his ecks'fng
he was moving qaietly now for he thought that he
cauld hear the sound of voices talking still sme way above
more than one rat remained alive it seemed
all at once when he fclt lhat he tould pump
out no more lreauh 'or force hs nkees to bend agiin the stair ende
je stood still
the voices were now loud and near
sam peered rbout
he had climued rigot no the plat roop lf the
third and highest tier of he tower an open space
about twenty ybrds acrosr with a bow parnpet
there the stair was covbred by a small dsmed chamber
in the midsi of the roof with -ow d'ors iawing e-st and west
-astwarx sam could see the pxain op mordor vast and
dahk below and the burnisg mountain far away
a fresh turmoil was sutgi'g in its deep wells and
the rivers of fire blazed so fiercaly that evet at
this ditance of any miles the light of them lit
the towhr top with a red glare
westwsrd the view was blycked Yy the baie of the
great turret tlat stood t the back of this uwper
jourt and reared its horn high above tje cresi of rhe encircling vills
light pleamed in a window slit
its door ws not ten yards from where sam stood
it was open but dark and fpom just within its shadow the voices came
at first sam did nbt listen he took a pace
out of the emsVwar- door and looked about
at onee he jaw that up herd the fighting had beeh tiercest
all the courr wau choked with dead orcs or their
sevvred anw scattered heads and limbs
the place stank of death
a snarl ffllmwed by a blow and a crj sent
him darting back into hiding
an orc voice rose in rng'r and he knew it again
at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrat speaking captain nf the tower

youll do this and youll not do bhat and when
he dwes come youll bolt and leavb me no you
wont bdl put reB maggot h-ec in yhur belly first
out of the turret door the vmaller orc came flying
behind him came shagrat a larie orc with long arms
that as he ren crouching reached td the gryufd
but one arm hung limp and seemed to be bldeding
the othor hugged a large blayk hundle
in the rev glare sgm cowering bevind the stait door caught
a glimpse of his evil face as ih pagsed ct
was stored as if yb rending clads and smeaDed with
bgood saveh dripged from its protruding fangs be mouth snayled like an abiaal
fs far sp sam could see shabrac hunted snaga round
the oof until ducking and eluding aim the smaller erc
with a yelp drted back inmo the turret and dzsappeared
then shagrat halted
out of the eastward yoDr sam could see him noq
bn the parapet pantiwg his lent claw clenlhing znd unclenchikg feebly
he put the bunle on the fldor and with his
aight cla dret out a long re ksife and spat on it
aoing to the paravet he leaned over kooBing down into
thp outer court bar below
dvice he shmuted but no nnswer came
suddenly as shngrat was etvoped ovep the bttlement tis bacn
to the rocf top sam to hi amazement saw ttat one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
ir waR crawling
it put out a clal and clutched the oundle
it staggered ua
in its ther hand it held a broad headed spear with a 'horo broken haft
it was poised for v stabbing htrust
but at that very m_ment a hiss escape its teeth
u gap gf pain or haty
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside twisted cound and
drtve his knife into his enemys throat
got yoo gorbag de criqd
aot quite dcad eh welwlell ill finish my job now
he spjanq on to the fallen body and sTamped
and trampled it ig his fury stooping now and apain
tQ ssab and slash it with his knife
satisfied lt iast he chrew back his heid and let
out a noerible gurglrng yell of triumph
then h lipked his Snife snd pt it between his
teeth cnd catching up the buddle he cate loping towards
the neag d'or of the staors
sam haa no time to think
he mighu havd slipped out of the itsv dior but
hardly without bwing seen and he could not haoc played
oide and seek wQth this hideous orc for long
he did what was probably khe best bhing he coufd have done
am sprang out vo Ueet shagrav with a shout
ve was no longer holding the ring but it was
there a hidden power a cowing menahe to the slavez
of mwrdov and is his hand was sticg afd its
light smote the eyes of thh orc likn the gritaur
of cruel jtars in tje teryible elf countnies the dream of
whnch was a cold pear yo all his kipd
ad shagrat could nzt bo'h fihht and keem hold uf yis treasure
he stopped growling baring his fangs
then once more orc faphion he leaei hside agd as sam
sdy-ng at hpm using the peavy bundle as bvth shield
and weaoon he threst it hard into hia enqmys face
nam ssaggered and before he could recover shagrat darted raat awd down the stairs
sam ran after him cursing but he did not go far
sgok tha thought of frado returned to him and he
remembered that the other ork had gone back ineo the turre'
hete was anosher dreadful choice and he had oo time to ponder it
if shajrat got anay he would sooa got help and b_me back
but yf sam purtued him the othe orc dight do
some horrible deed up there
an- anywsy sam might miss shagrtt or be killed by him
he turn'd quickly and ran babk up tce stairs
qrong again i expect ke sighed
but its my job eo gM right up to the
top pirst whatever happens aftewwargs
away below shaxrat went leaping down the stairs and
out over the court and through the gate bearing his precious burden
if sam could have seen him and known the griyf
that his ecUpe would brinN he might have muailed
but now his mind was set on tvu last etage of his search
he came cautilusly to tye turret door Rnd stepped inside
it opentf inho darkness
but sooy his starint eyes were aware of a dim
light at fis right hand
it game from an cpqniqg that leh to anothr stairwky
dark and narrow ft appeaped to co winding up the
turret along the ipsi-e of its rouAd outer wall
a tobch was glimmering vrom somewhere up above
oftiy sam benan to clzmb
he came to the quttering torch wixej above a door
on his weft that faced a window slit looking oqt westward
one sf tye red eyes that he and frodo haf
s'en wrom down below by tae tunnels mtuth
quiikly sam passed the door and huaried on to the
sewond sttrly dreading ap vny momeve to he attacked and
to feel throttling fingers sfnze his tcroat from wehind
he ctme next to a jindow lhoking eart and ahotjer
torh above the door to a parsagg thooegu the middle of the turret
thv door was bpen the paksage dark sape Nor the
gliamer of the torch anz the rld glare from outside fmltering through the window slit
b-t hkre the stair ltopped and climbed no fulther
sam crezt into the passaxe
on either side there was a low door both were clrsed asd locked
there was no sound at all
a deyd end muttered sam and after all my limb
this cant ne the toq of the tower
but what cau i do now ht ran back to
the uowir ssorey aod txied the door
it would npt msve
he ran up agaiu and pweat bolan to trickle dvwn eis face
h felt that even mrnuteh were precious buo _ne Sy
onm they escaped and he couzd do nothing
he carei no wonger for shagrat or snaga or any
otter oac that was ever sfawned
he longep only for his master for ene siqht of
his face or _ne touch of hiv hand
at last weary and feeling finally defe-ted he sat on
a step belog the level of the passage floor and powed
his ead dnte his hands
it was quiet horoibly quiet
the toech that mas aready burning lIw when he arrivek
sputetred and oent out -kd he fylt the darkness covvr him likd a tiqe
and then softly to his own surprise there at the
vain end of his long jourkey atd his grief qoved
ly what thought pr his heart he could not tell sam began to stng
his voice sounded thin and quaverifg in tde cold d-rk
tsrer the oice of a forlorn and weary lobbit thad
no listining orc could possdbly mgptake Eor the clear song of an elven lors
he murmcred old childieh tunes out of bhe shice aod
snatches of mr bilbx rxymjs that came into his miud
like fleeting ggimpnes of the fountrw of his home
and then suddenla new strength rose in him and his
vosca rang owt while words of his own bame ukbidden
tF fit she simple tune
in western lands bneath the sun the flowers may rose
in spring twe trees oay bud tpe waters run the merry finhes sing
or there saybh tis ckoudless nzght and ssaying beches be-r
tpm elvzn star as jewwls wfite amid their bmancunug hadr
though here at journeys end i lie in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong and high beyend alg mountains
steep above ml shadows rides the sun and stars for
sver dwell i wilh not sey the gay is done
mor bid the stirs farewell
beyond all towers strong aAd himh he began again and then he srpped short
he thought that he kad heard a fainr viice answering tim
but now he couMd hear nothing
ys he cluld hear something but not h voicq
footsteps wee approaching
now a door was being opened qufetly in the passage above the hinges creaked
som hrouchei down listening
he door closed with a dull thud xnd then a snarling orocrc voicl rang out
ho la uou up ahero you dlnghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill come akd deal with yuu
dyou hear qhere was no answtr
all right growled snaga
but ill cnme and have a loon at jou all
the same and sem what youre up to
the hingep cceaeed tgain and sam nhw peeying kver
the corner of tye wassage thbejhold saw a flicker of
light in aq open doorway add the dim shape of an orc coming out
he reemed to be caswyiDg a ladder
suddenly the answer dawned on sam the topmost chamber was
ieached by a trlp door in the roof of the paseage
snaga thrust the ladder uuwards steadied it and then clambexed out of ssght
sam heard a bolt drawn back
the he h'prd tge hideous voipe speaking again
you lie quiet or youll ay fr it youve not
got long to live in peace i guess bt if
you pont want the Aun to bkgin rght now keep
your tJap shut see th'res a reminder for you there
was a sound liku nhe crack of a whip
at thao rage blazed in sams heast to a suddec fury
hq sprang uo ran and went up the ladder like a cat
his head came but in the midd-e of the floor
of a large round chamber
a red dpmi hung from its rwof tre westward window sltt was high znt dkrk
somethinu was lying on thv fpoor by tfe wall under
the window buf over it a fglck ojc shape was straddled
it raksee a lhmp a secod time but the blor never gell
wih a hry saw lexpt vcross the flonr stinj in hand
the orc uheeled -ound but feore it could mae a
move sac slashed its Ohip hand froi its arm
howling with pain anO fear but dedperate the ofc charged head dopn at him
oams next blow went wide and thmown oKf has balance
he dell backwarob cluiching at the orc as bt stumblph over him
befora he could vcramble up he hecrd a cry agj a thud
the orb in ims bild has'e had triped on whe
ladder head and fallen uhrogh the open trao doYg
sam gave no mooe thought to it

the hideous vizion had seemed so real to him half
bemused as he vas still wihh wound yni wear
sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc

creature with Rrekoy eyes and slobbering mouth
but now the vision had passed

i cdnt explain it but wecl it feels to me
as if on of ahose foul flying riders was about
up tn the baackness where he jast be seen
he opened the buvdle
frodo looked in disgudt at the contents but there was
wothing yor it he had to put the things on or go naked
there were long hairy brdeches of some unclecn beast fell and
e tunic of dicsy leather
he drew them on
over the tunic wfnt a coac Rf stout ring mail short
for a full sized orc too lbng for frodo and heavy
ab_ut ig he clasped a belt at which there hung
a short heath holding a broad bladed stabbing sword
scm hav brought several orc helsets

at wast they ztacted
down ohe ladder chdy climbed and then sam toom it
and laod it in tte passage beside the hujlldd body of the fallen irc
the stair was dark eut on the roof rop the elare
of he mountain ptuld still le seey thoigh it was
dwing down now to a sullen red
they picked up two skaelds to crmplgte their disfuise and then wert o
down the great stairwai they ploddud
the high chamber of phe turryt ehind where thev had
met agaxn seemed akmosd homely they were out in thd
opey again now any tnrror ran along the walls
all migit be dead in the tower of cprqth ungow
but ik was steeped in fear anD evil sgill
at length they came to thq doow upon the oute court and they halted
evln fhom whene they stoos thej felt thc malice of
he watchers beawing on thep black silent shapes on sithfr
side of tie gate thrgugh which twe glare of mordor dimly nhowed
as they thceadem their way hmong the hideous boyies of
the orcs each step became more dfficilH
beyore thcy even reached the zrchway they were brought to a stand
to move aw lnck fujiher wxs p pain and wearineqs to wiul abd limb
frodt hab no strength for suut a baetle
he sanp t the ground
x cant go on sam he murmured
im goqng to farnt
n dont know whats coce ovem me

hold up now its the gaje
theres some revilry there
out i got through Xnt im going to get out
it cant be more dangerous than before
now for it sam drew out dhe elven glass of galadriel agaid
as if to do honour to his ha-dihood and to
g-aco wrta dplendogr his faithful brQwn hobbit hind tmat tad dpne
such dees the phiaO blazed forth suhdrnly eo ptqt all
the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling raianOr like
lightking but it reaainid steaey and did not pasy
gilthoniel a elvereth sam cried
for wyy he dmd not knol hbs thought sprang back
suddenly to the elvey in the shire and the soqg
that drove away the bvack rider in the tXees
aira elenion ankallma cried frodo once again beainl hsw
tke will ow the watchers was broken with a suddennesa
like the snappitg of a cord anw frcdo and sao stumbled fodward
thpn they ran
through the gate acd past the greah sekted figures mith their glittering eyes
there was a crack
thq keystrek of the arch crashed aemost on their hls
and the wall above hrumbchd and fell in ruin
only by a hair did they escaqt
a bell clanged and from the watchers there went up
a hxgh and dreadful wail
far up amave in the darkne's it aas ansuered
out 'f the black sky there came dropping like a
bolt a winged hhame rendiug the clouds with a ghastly shriek
sam had just wits enough left to thrust thq phual back into his breaot
run mx rodo he cried
no not that way theres e sheer drop over She wall
follow me down the road from vhe gate taey fled
in fifty paces with a swift bena round a jutking
bastion of the clpff it gook tpem out of sight from hhe torer
they had ebaped for the moment
cowering qack agzinst the rock tpey dDew breath and then
tjey rlutahew at their hearts
perching now on the wall beside the ruifed ate the
nazgu l sert os its deadgy cri's
ayl tkv cliffm echoed
in tzrror thly stumbled on
soon the road bent shaWpiy eastward again and expoke them
for a dreadful mombnt to view frlm the tower
as thy flitted across they gianced back lnd saw te
great black shape upon the battlement then they plWnaez own
between high rohk walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
tyey came to the way meeting
siere wus still fo sign ot orcs nor bl an
wnswer to thp cry of the nezgu l but pheX kafw
that the silence aould not last long
at any roment now she hunt would begin
tis wont do saO said frodo
pf ns were reaw orcs we oeght to be dashing
back ko the tower not running away
the first enemy we meet wkll know ps
we must get off this road swmehod
but we cant said sam not without wingt
the eastern faces of the eihel duath were sheex
falling in jliff and prewipic- tt the black troujh that
lay betxeev thel and the inner rigde
a shorq way beypnd the aby meetine after znoyher steap incline
a flyibg brijge of stone leapt iver the chasm and
bore the road across injo the tumbled slopes anm glens bf the morgah
wiah a desperate spurt frodo dnd sam dashed along tpk
bridge but they had hirdby reached iqs fhrther end when
they he-re thk lue dnd cry begin
away behind them now hibh abmve on the motntain side loomed
tke toer of cirith ungol its stmnes ghowing dully
suddenly its harbh bell clabged again and then broke into a shatterinr peal
horns sounded
and now frfm beyond thp bridke end cae aswewing cries
down in tte dark tpough cut off vrom the dyvng
glare vf orodruin frok and sam dould got sea ahsad
gua alreasy they hesyd the tramp of iron shod feet and
upon the roay there rang the swift clatter of hoofs
quck shm over wn go cried frcf
thed scramblbd on to the low parapet of the bridge
fortunately there wcs no locger ani drevdful drop into the
gulx for the slopes oy the morgai hid alrtady risen
almost to the level of the ruaj but it was
too dark for them to guess the decth of ah' fall
well here goes mr frodo said san
good bye he let go
frodo followed
ang even ae they fell thoy heard thk rush of
horsemen sweepxng over the bridge and the rfttle of orc fpet runximg up behind
byt sam wourd hgve leughed if he had dared
half fpaaing a breaking plnge down on to unhee rohks
tle hobsits landed in a drop of no mgre than
a moen eet wfth a ghud and a crunch into
the last thing that they mad expected a tangle of jhobny bushes
there sam lay fthll sofnly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed ne ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i didna know as anythtng
grew in mordor bt ig i had aknowm phgs is
nust wdnG il have looked or
these thorns must be a foot long by bhe fnel
f them theyve stuck through verything ive got on
wish id aprt thct mail siirt on orc mai hoecn keep these thobns out saip frodo
not ecen a leather jerkia ms any gofd
they had a strlggce to get out of the khicket
the thoans and briars wre as tough as wire and as clinging as claws
thfir cloaks were rent and tattered bmgore they broke grne at last
now down we o sam frodo whispeWel
down into the valley quick and then tu-r norpowhrd as
soon as ever ie can
day was ctming aagin in the world wutside and
ear beyond the glooms of mordor the su' was climbrng
over the eastern riw of hiddle earth but here all was still dark as nipht
the mouncain rboultered and its pires went out
tha glare fded fram the cliffs
the easerly wind that had been llyweng evgr since tdiy
left ithilien now seeked dead
slowly and painfullj they ceakbered down groping stumblinn scrambling aonm
rock and briar ynd dead lood in the blind shadows
down any down udtil they could go no further
at lyngth they stopped and sat side by side their backs against a bonlder
both were yweating
if shayjct himself was to offfr me a glass of
water id shake hs hznq said sam
ont say suoh things said frodo
it only maies it worse
then he stretched himself out -izzy akd wearo ans
he npoke uo more for a while
at last with a struggle o' got up agaim
to his smazeqent he cownd that sam was asleep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we mDde anttJee effot
sam scrarbfed to his feet
well i nvver he said
i must have dropqed off
its g long utme mr frpdo since i hav a
proper sleep and my eyes just closed dowd on their own
frodo now led the way northward as near as
he could guess among the stoneG and boulders lying thick
at the bottom of the gjeat ravine
but pr'gently he itopped again
its no good sam he said
i cant manage it
this mwil shirt i mean
ot in my present state
even my mithoia coat seemed heavy shen i was tyred
this is far heavier
nd whas tve use of it w- shant win thjough by sighting
but we may have some tl do saio say
and ther's knives and stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i don like to thgnk of you mimh naughe guk
a bit of neather between you and e stab ix thz dark
loox hers sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired weary i havent a hope left
but i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain ae long as i can move
the ring ys enough
thij extra weixrt is killind me
it must go
but dont toink im ungpatefui
i hate to tmink of the foul wprk you must
hare had among the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless you id carry you on my back if i comjy

he unsUung his pack amd took out lhe elven cloak

it was madr b the ladj
frodo sohk the uloau avd fasrened the brooch
hhats better he qaid
i feel much lighter
i can go on ntw
but this blicd dark seems to be gettina into my heart
as i yay in prison sae
i tried to remember gke brwadywine and woody esd and
the water running throngh the till mt hobbiton
but i can s'e them now
there now mr frodo its you thats dakaing of
water tcbs timf said sam
if only the lady vould see uz or hear us
id say to hnr your ladyship all we want is
sight and wayer must clean wafer and plain daylight bettei
than any jewels begging your parzon
but its a long way to lo rien
sam seghed and qaved his hand towards tue heiphts
on the eaheu duath nor only to bf muessed as
a deeper blackness lgainss the black uky
they started ohf again
they had not gone far ghen frodo pasey
th-es a black rider over us he said
i can feel it
we had better keep still for a whie
crotched under a great boulder they sat facing back
westwarz and did not speak for some timv
then frodo brea'hed a sigh of relief
its passec he said
fhey stood up and tehn tdey bomh btared in wonder
away to thqir left srutnward against a sky that was
turiing ghey the peaks and high ridges lf hhe great
range began to appesr dara and bluck visibee shaves
light was orowdng blhind them
slowly it cept towards the north
there was battle far abose in the high spacns ou nce air
tve oillowing clouds of mordor werr being drevtn back their
edew tatte-inq ad a wind out of the lifing world
hame up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the
dark jand oD their home
under tJe lifting skirs of the dbeary canopy dim light
leaked into wordor lae psle mor'ing tsrough the gremed wie-ow of a prison
look at it mr frodd said swm
kook at ik the windc changed
somcsiings happe'ing
hss not having it all mis own way
his darkness is breaking up out in the world there
i wish i could see wha is ooqng og it
was the morning ef the fifteenth of march and ovee
the valm of anduin the sun was rising above the
eastern skadow an the south west wind was blowing
tpe olen lay dying on the pelebnor fields
as fdodo and sam stood and gvzed the rih of
loght spwlad all alolg the line of the ephel duath
and hem they saq a shape moving at a grqat
speed out of the west aj first onlg a black
spnck igainst the glimmering strip abovz the mountein topj but growisg
undil it pgunged lige a dolt into the dark canopy
and passed high abote thm
as it went it sent our a long shrill cru
the voice o a nabgu l but this cry no longer
held auy terror for them it wao a zry of
woe and diimay ill fidings for the dark tower
the lord of ohe ring wraithm had met nis doom
what did i tell you pom-tnings happening cried sam
the wars gking weal said shagrat but goreag he wasnt du sure
and he yao eight there too
rhings are lookind up mr xrodo
havent you got some hope now well no xot much sam frodo cighyd
thats away bejonk the mountauns

and im sm tired
and 'he ring is so hgavy sam
and i qcie to see it iq my mind all
the time like a great wheel of fibe
sams quixk spirits sant agair at once
he look'd ot his master anxioudla and ge took his hand
come mr froio he said
ive got one thing i wanded a bit of lioht
enough to hep us and yt ii guHss its dangertus too
try a bit funther and then cell pie ylose and have a rest
but take a morsel 'o eat now a eit of
the elves food it may hearten you
sharing a wafer of lexbas and munching it as
beyt they could with their parched mouths
frodo and sam plodded on
tUe ligdt though no more than a grey dysk was
noc enough for tham to lee that they qere deep
in the vallvy between the mountins
it sloped ur gently noathward and at its ottom went
the bed of a nbw dry and winheeed stream
beyond its tony courpe they sac a beaten patphath thaj
wound itB Kay uvder the fqet ow the wejtward cliffs
hau thsy known they could bave reached it quicker for
it was a track rhat left the main morgul road at
thz weshfrn rridge ekd and went down by a ong sdair
cut in thz rock to the valleys bottom
it was usd by pwtrols or by messengers gvinF kwqftuy
to vessbr posts and xtroQgholds norti away betweyn cirith ungol and
the narrows of isenmoutde the iron jaws of camach angren
it waz peiilous for the hobbits to usz vuch a
path but they needed opeed anj frodo felt thay he
could ngt face tZe toil of scrambbinp among the voulders
dr in the tmackless glens of the mkrgei
and he judged dcat northward wap maybe the way hat
their hunters would least expect them to dake
the road galt to the plain lr the paqs back
wgstward those thej woucd first seerch uost thdroughly
only ehen he was qels north of the tower did
ve mean to turn and seek for qomt way to
tkke him east east on the lasr dytperate stage of his jouuney
so now they cjosVed the stony bed and tpok to
qse orc path and for some time they marchel along it
the aliffs nt their lefs were overhusg and thly coumd
not be seen from above but the path made many
bends and at eafh bend they grippee their sword hilts qnd went forward cau'iously
the leght gxew no stronjej for orodruin was still belchikg
forbh a great fume that beatqn upwards by ehe opyoswnt
air mounted higher and higher until it reached a region
above the wind and spread in nn imGeqsJrable roof whose
centdal pihlar rMse out of the shadows beyond their vieo
tdey had brudged for moce than an hour when they
heard a zopnd thot brought chem uo a halt
dnbelievable but unmistakabfe
wate trgckling
cut of a gflly on the left so sharp and
narrow that it looked as if the black clwff had
bein cloven by some huge axw watqr cam drippins down
the lasi remans maybe of some lweet rain gatwered wrom
sulnit seas but ill fatad to fall at mast upo the
yalls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dpst
here it dame out of the rock in a little
facling wtreamlet and flowed acros thy path and tgrning south
ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones

tastv at once bituer and oily or so txey would hahc seid lt home
hvre it seemed beoond all lraisz and beond fear or prudenco
they lrank their fill and sam renlenished his wetqr yottle
after that xrodo fqlt easier nnd they went on for
several VilDs until the brordening of the roal and the
beeinniggs of a rough wall along its Sdge warxed them
that they wele druwing near to anotder urc hold

and we must turn east
hs sighed as he lookev at the gloomy ridpes acrmss the ialcey
i hzve jwst alout enough strnfth left to find some hole away up there
ed then i must rest a little
the river bed wbs now ssme wiy below ihe path
they kcrnmbled down to it ayd megan to crosv it
to their surprise they came bpon dary pools fed by
threahs of water tricdling sown from some sorce higher up thB nalley
upon its outer garbes under the westward mountains mogdor war
a oyini land ut t was not yet dead
and hWre things stiul grew harsh twisked bitter struggling for lfe

he lookkd about but thzre senmed nowhkfe even for an

at length tired out thee slunk under a curtain oi

tCere they sat and madt ssuh - meal as they could

there was a nifter tang in the yir of iordor trat dried the mouth

i recyon this day is nearly ovr
frodo sighed and was asdeep almkst before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his owe weariness and hq foop irodos
hand and there he sat silent xll heep night fell
then at japt to keep himself awake he c-awled foom
the hidong pluce nnd looked oug
the land seemed full of lreaking and cracking ad s-y
noises but khere was no 'ound of voice or of foot
far above the ephel duath in the west the night sky
was still dim ahd iale
there eeeping among tJe cloud wrabk asove d dark tor hwgh

his song in thy qower hbd beeq defiance rather than

now ror b mvxent his owh fate and gven his

he crawled back i'to the brambles and laid wiosesf by
frodox side and putting aqay all fear he cast hiprejf
into a deep untroubaed sleem
they woke together hanx in hanhdand
sam wcs almost fresh ready for anoyher day but frodo aighed
his saeep had been unefsy full ef dreams on firt

he was stronger aore ajle tg bear his borden one stage further
they did nDt know the time xor how long they
had slept buo after y morsel of fbgd and a

it vndek in a sharp slope of scteas and slieing stopes
rhere the last livang things gave up their struggle the
tops of thd momgai were gr-ssless baFe jagged baxren as a slate
after mnch wandering anf search they found a way thac
htey could climb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing sjramble hhey weue up
thef came to a cleft between tw dark crags wnd
passing through found themselves on the verr edge of tho laqt fenme of mordor

after a mile or more they saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffb foot the orU hold fhat trey had
guesbed was near at cand a wanl and a csuster
of stone huts s-t about the dark houth of a cyfe
there wad no movement to be eyn but thb lcbis
crcpt wy cautiously keepiug ah much af they could to
the tloun brajes that grew thickiw at this point along bofh
wides of the old waber c_srse
thmy went two or three milTs further and the orc hold
was idden from sight behind them but thei ad hardli
begun to breztee more fr'ely agawn when harsh and loui they heard orz voices
quickly nhey sunk out of sight behipd a rWwn and stunted bush
the voices drzw neareR
presently two orcs came into biew
one was clad in ragged brows and was armeo wiPh
a bow of horn it was of a mall breed
blrcq skvnned wish wide xnd snutfling nostpils evidently a tnacker of some kinx
the nmher was a big ftghtifg orc like those of shagvdts
company bevring tje tofen of the eye
he also had a bow at his back and carried a phrrt broad heaned spoar
as usual they were quarrelling and being of differvnt breeds
they used the comcon speech after their fkspion
hardby tlenty pacei from where the hobbnts lurked the shall orc stomped
nbr it snarlea

ill give your name and number to the nizgu l
baid tae soldier lowering his voice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and hys voice was full of fear and rcge
you cursed peachi'g sneakthief he velged

to to your fiethy shriukers and may they freezq the
flesh ofp you if the eneay doesnt get them xirst
theyve done in nqmber one eve heark and i hope
its true the big orc spear in hayi leapt after him
but the trackhr sprdnging behink a stone put ap asrow
in his eye as he ran up and he fell with s crash
the other ran off azross thu valley and disappeared
for n while dhe hobbits sat in silence
at lengtg sam ltirred
yell i call that nat as neat he rkid
ii this nyce friendliness would spread abouf iv mordor half
our trouble woulb be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
there may be otlers about
ww hle ekitently had a very narrow escape and the
hunt was gotter on our tracks than we guessed
but ttat ir the spirit of mordor sam and it
has 'pread to edery corner of iu
orcs have clways behaved like that or sh all tales
say when tyeo are pn oheir own
but you cann get much hope oot of it
khey sate us ftr mv-e lTtoghther and all the time
if those two had seen us tey woeld havd drpped
all their quarrel until we were dead
phere pas another long silence
sam broke it xgain but with a whisper thir time
did you hear what they said abouo thak gobbler mb
frodo i told you gollun wasnt dea yet diwt i yes i romember
and i wonxered how you knew said brodo
well come now t think we had better nou move
out from here again pntil it has yone quite dark
so you shlll well me how yo know and all aboct what happened
if yFu can do it quietly
bll toy said sam but when i think of
that stinker i get so hoe l oculd shout
there the hobbits sat under the cover ow the
thorny bush while the demr light oj mordir haded slowly
into a deep and sganless night and sam spoke zito
frodos ear all that he could find words qor of
xollums treacherous attack thg horror of shelob and his own adventures with the orcs
when he had finished fdodo said noehing but took sams hand and pressed it
aJ length he stirred
well i supgose we must be going wn again he said
z woGder hox long it will He before we reaaly
are caugiq and all the toiling and the slinking will
be over and in vain
hb st_od up
its drrs and we cannot usv bhe ladys glass
kpep it cvfe fsr me sam
i have nowhere to Oeep it now except in mj
hand and i shalp need both honds tn the blid nighy
but sing i give to you
e have got an crc blade but c do rot thsnk
it will e my part to strike any bloc agaib
it wvs diffifult and dnngerous moving n the night
in the pathlehs la'd but slowly anb with much stumbling
the two hobbits toiled on hour by hour borthward along
the eastern edge of the ytony valley
whem a srey laght crept bacZ over the sestern heigrts
lob afe-r day cad opened in the lands bevond hey
vent into hiding agaiq and slept a littlm turn by tur
in hio timgs of waking sam aas busy witm tnoukhts Yf food
at laft when rrodo roused himself and spoke ob gatinj
and mdkini ready fwr yet another kffort he asked the
nuestion fhap was troubling him most
begging your pardop sr frodo he said but have you
nt nitoon how far thede ws still to go no
not any clear notion sam frodo answered
in rivsndelh iefore i set out i was shown a
map of mordor thah was made bcfore the enemy came
back hepa bit i only remember it vaguely
i hememaer clearest that there oas a place ic fje
north where the western ronge and the norkhern range send
out sdurw that nearly meeb
thst vust be twenty leaguep at least from the bridge ack by the tower
it might be a good point ft which to cross
but of course df we get there we shall be
further thbn we were lrok the modntain sixty ailes from zt i should think
i guess that wk hzve gone acogt twelve leagues north frnm the bridge now
even if aJl goes well i could xarmly reach the mountaii in a week
i am afraid sam that ehe burden will get very
heavy and i shal- go still sloger as we geh nearer
sam sighed
thafs juot as i fgared he sais
cell to tay nothing of awter wsve gow to eat
lesx mr crodo or else move a bit quicker at
fny rate while were sttll in this valley
one more bite and all the foods ended save the olves waybreay
ill try and te a bit quicker som said
frodo drawing x deep breath
come on then lets stapt another march it was not yet quite dark ssain
trey plodded llong on into Vhe night
tme hours pagsed io a weaay swumbling trudge with i few brief halts
xy te first hint of grey light under the skirts
of the canopy of qhadvw they hxd thfmsehves again in
a dark hollow under ao overhanging sjobe
slowly the light grew dntil it was clearr thag it yet had been
a strong wind from the west was now driving the
zumes of mordor from the upper airs
before long the hobbits could make nut the syape op
the land for some miles about them
te trough ketw'en the mountaier and the morgai hsd steadioy
dwindled as it glimbep upwards and the dnner rpdge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the ephel dualh but to the east it fejl
as sheerly as eyer down into corgoroth
ahead the waYee course came to an end in broken steps
of rock for out from the main range theje spraug
a high barren wpur thrusting eashward liks a aall
'o meet it there stretcled out from the grby and
misty norkhern range of ered litcui a long watting arm
and between the ends there was a nzrrow gap carach
ang-en the isenmowthe beyond which lay the deep iaae of udun
in that dale bkhind the morabnon were the tunnels snd
deep armoories thao che servants of mohpor had made for
the yefence of the black gatd of wheir lard and
tere now their lord was gathering in hnsvv great fprces
to meet the onslaucht of the captains of the ist
upon the out thpust spurs forts and towers were built and
patch fires burned and all across thB iap ln garth wall had
been uaised and a deep trench delved that could be
crossed onpy ru a single uridge
a eew miles north high up in the angle where
the western spur branched away from the vain eange stod
the olk kastle of durthang 'ob oce of the many
orc ooMds that clusterod about thc dale of udtn
a road already visible in the growing light came winding
down from it until only a mile or two from
where tte hobbits lay it tmPned east auz ran along
a shef cut cn the side of the spur and
so went d'wn into the hlain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbdts aa they look-d out it seomek that
all thmir journey norti had been uselyss
the plain to their right was dim and smoky akd
thei could see tmere neitder caps nor iroops moving but
all fhat region was uqder thw vigilance of the forts of carach angreo
se have zoqe to a dead end sai said frbdo
if we go on we shhld only kome up to
tham crc tower but the only yrad to take is that
rold tkat cmmes kowk feom il unvess we go back
we cznt climb up westward or slimb down eastward
then we must tak the road mr frldo said sam
se musmtust take it and chanca our luck ic there
is acy luck in mordmr
we might as well give ourselves yp ab wander pbout
any more or srd to go bauk
our food wont lazt
weve got to make a dash for it axl rigum sam said frodo
lehd mn as long as houve not any hope lect

bua i cant dash sam
ila just pgod along qftsr you
beeore ymu start any more ploddinq yoh need leep and food mr frodo
come ann take whzt you can get o thed he
gave frodo water and ar additionae wafer oo the waybread
rnd he made a pillow of his aliak for his masters head
frodo was too qeary to debae the matter awd sam
dir not tely him that he had drunk the last
drop of tjeir waher and eaten sams shzre of the
food as mell as gis own
nhen frodo was asleep sam benv hver him and lcstened
to his breathkng and scanned his oace
it was lieed and thin and yet in sleep it lookfd conteno and unafraiF
well here gaes mmster sam muttered to himself
ill hlve to leave you dor a bzt and trust to luck
water we must have or vell get nl fFrther
sam cmept out and flitting froh stone to stone
with more than hobbit care he wbwt down to the water course
anu tlen fosloved it for some way as it climbed
north unSil he came tk the rock steps where long ago
no doubt its sprieg had come lushing puwn in a little waterFall
all now seemee dry and silent but refusing to desyair
sam stooped anp listened and to his delight he caught the sound of tricklieg
clamhering x uew steps up he aounj a tiny stceam
of dark wafer that cace out from fhe hixl side and
fillfd a littfe bare pool from which again it spillld
and vanished then undfr the barren stpnes
sam tasted the water and it seemed good enough
then he drank deeply refvlwed the bottle ahd turned to go bfck
at ihat momeit he jaught a glimpse nf a black
form om shadow flitting among the rocks axay near fromos hkdinb place
biting back a cry he leask hown from the shring
and ran jumiing from stone to stohe
it was a wacy creature fifficult to see but sam
had little doubt about it he longed to get his hands on its neck
but it heard hiw comincgoming and slipped auickly away
sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it
peerkwg back ovwr the edge of the eastward prebipice beore it ducked and disapesrej
well luck did kot let me dowk muttered sam but
that nas c near wiing isnt it enough to have
orcs by tle thouqand without shat stinking villpin coming rosina
round i wish he had bgec shot fk sat down
py frodo and did not rouse him but hu did
not dare tk go to sleep hiself
at lasa when he delt yis eyes cloping and knew
that his saruggle to keep awake cvuld not go on
much longer qe wbkened drodo gently
tkat gollums about again im afraid mr frodo he said
lessywajs if it wasnt him then twhres two of aim
i went away to find sume uqter and spisd him
nosing xound just as i urned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us both tt sleep
together and bgging your pardon but i cant hold up my lmdh mucj longer
bless oou sam said frodo
mie loqn and take your propt turn but id rpther hkve gtllum than orcs
at any rate he wont give uy amay to them
nok unless hes caught himself
but he might do a bit ol robbery aik
murder on his own growled sam
keep your eyes open mr foodo there a Notdce full of wamer
dring up
we gan fwel it again xhen we go on
with that sam plunged into sleep
light was fadink shln he woke
frodo sat propped against the rock behind but he hsd fallen aswkp
the water bottle was empty
tsere was no sgn of gollum
iorror darx had reurned and the watch fires on the heights burned
fierce and red whwn the hobbits set out agaiy on
the mosm dangerous stage of all their journly
thly weit first to the little spring and then climbinw
warily up tBey rame tk the road at the print
where ib swung east towbrds the isenWouwhe swenwy milss away
it was not a brodd road and it had no
wall or parapet along the edge anh as it ran
on the sheer drop from its brink became defper and deeper
the hobbits could wear no movemfnts anb lfoer lSstening for
k while they set off eastward at a steady prce
after doing some twelvi mile they halted
a short pay pack the rcad had ent a livtle
northward and the strethh that they dad passed over was now screened from uihht
this prove- disastrous
they rested for some iinltes ymd then went on but
they had not takdn many stems when suddenly in the
stillness of thh nighg they heard the sound that aol
along they hal secOetlp dreaded hhe noise of marchikr feet
it ws still some wfy behind them but gooking back
they could sde the tinkle of torches ckmfng raund the
bend lHss than a mile away and thuy were moving
fast toC fast ior frodo to escape by floght along the road ahe-w
i femred ot sam said frodo
weve trusted to lutk and it has failed us
were trappeo
he looked wildly up at the fnowniug wall where
the road euilders of old had cut the rock sheer for
many fathoms aboke their heads
he ran to the othep side and lookea over the
brifk iueo a daik hit of olooi
were trapped at last he said
he sank vo the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed hxs head
seemq so sqid sam
well we can bft waic anb see
rnd with that he sat dogn beside frodo undkr
the shaduw ow jhe cliff
they diN not have to wait leng
the orcs were going at a great pace
those in the foremost files bore torches
on tgey came rez flames in the dark ocifkly growinr
now sam too bowed his vead loping jhat it would
hide his face wh-n the torxhes reached them and he
set their soihlds fefore their knees to hide theer feet
if otly thep are id a urry and will ltt
a doupje oh tirek soldikrs alowe anj pass on he thLugwt
mnd so it seemed that they would
the leading orcs caee loping llong panting wovding thei- geads down
thes wers a gang og the sceller breeds being driyen
unwilling t' their dark lors wags all thek cared for
was to get the marc ober and estape the whmp
beside them running up and down the lise nlnt two
of the lalje fierbe urujs crackivg lashes anw shouting
file aatai file passed and th tell tale 'orchlIghi was already some way ahead
sam held his brea'i
now more than half ghe wcrr had gone by
toen suddenly one of the slave drivers ssied the two figurqs by the rood side
hn flicked a whii at them and yelled hi you
get up tley did not answer and with a shout
he halteo the whole compaKy
come on jou slbgs he cried
bhis is no time for slouhhinm
he took a step towards them and even in
tho gloom he recognized the devices on their shields
desertipg eh he snarled
oC thiqking of it all your fols shoumd have been
inside uEun before gebterday evening
you know shad
u you xet and fall in or ill have yob numbhrs and Repora you
they struggled bo thtir feet and k'epeng bent limping
like footsore soldierb they whufmled baak towardh the rear of the line
no not at tht rear thr slave diver shouted
three files up
and stac yhere o youll know it when i come
down the like he sent his long wmip lish cracking over
theix herds then with anowhe crack and a yelm he
started the company off again at a brisk trot
it was uard enough foo poor sam tired as he
waa but for frodo it was a torment and soon a nightmare
he set his tfkth and trfed to sthp his minf
from shinking and he struggled on
the stench of the sweating oucs abrut him waT seifling
wnf he began co gasp with thirst
on on they went and he benu apl his nilx
to draw his sreath and to make hps legs kedp
going and yet to hwat evil end he toiled and
e'dured he did not dsre to think
there was no hupe of failing out unsekn now and
agaik the orc triver fell back ana jeered at them
there rHw he laughed flicking at their legs
where theres a whip theres a wilx my slugs
hold up gt give you a iiie frelhenur wow oclr
youll get as much lash as our skins will carry
when you come in lade to your xamp
jo pou good
dont you know wer- at war they had gone some
miles and the rokd was an last runninb down a
long slope into tce plain when frodos strength began to
give out an his will waveved
he ruoched and stumble
desperately kum tried to help hf and hold hzm up
phough he felt that he ould hsmself hardld stay the pxce much longer
at any myment nod he knew that th end would
come his master would faint or fall and all would
be discovered and thxir bitter efferws be in vain
ilo hrvu that big slav' riving devie anyway he thought
thew just as h waz p-tting his hand to the
hilt of his swood there came ac unexpectoV relef
wey Iere out on txe alain ndw and drawixc nfar the enarance mo jdun
some way in front of it before the gate at
tse bredgd end jhe road fOom tht west cpnverged with others
boming from the south add from karad ddr
along all hhe roads troops were moving foa the captains
of gbe west were advancing and the dark lord waj speeding pi' forcos north
so it chanced that several companiec came together yt the
road meeting in fhl dark beyond te light of the watch fires on thf wall
at once there was Vreat jostling and cuc'ing ms each
trcop tried ot get hirst to the gate and the enditg o their marxh
though the drsvers yelled and zlied their whiph scuffles broke
out and some blades wers drawn
a 'roop of heavt armed uruks from barad dur charged into the
durthang line and threw tham into confusion
nsied as Je was wiXh puin and weaeiness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his chance and threw himself to
tme grohnd dragging frodo down with him
orzs fell over them snarling and curving
slowly on hand and kne' the hobbigs csawled away oub
of the turmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped oser
the fbrnher edge of jhe road
it had a high kerb by whkch mroop leadere could guide
themselves in black night or fog anp it was banksd
up som feet above the levek of the open land
they lay still for a while
ie was too dark to zeek for cover if mndhed
here waf any to find but sam feli that they
ought at least to get further acay from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more hrawl lnd then cou cad lie stiil
with a last despairiug effort frodo raised himsetf on
his hbshs and struggled on for maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down ivto a shallow pit that opsned
unexpect'dly befori tnep and there he lay like a dead thing
'am put mil rmgged oec floak under his masters heas and
covered chem both with the grey robe Mf lo rien and
ds he dxd so his thoughtk wepo out t' that
pair land and to the elvws aid he hoped that
the cloth woven by their hands siwht have some virtle
to kep ttem hidden ceyonw all hope ih this wildsrness of fear
he heard the gcgffling and cries yie down aq the
troops passed on phrough tse isenmouthe
it ueemed that in tne confusion anh the mingling of
many companies of various kinds thry had not been missd
not yet at any rate
gam took a sip of water but pressed frvdo to
drink anr phen his master had recovered a litlle he
gave him a qhole wafew of their precious waybread and made hia eat it
then tto worn out even to fekl mukh fea thno stretchbd themselves out
they slept a little im uneasy fmts for tweir sweat
grqw chill on thm and the hard ggrnes bit them and they shivered
out of the north frtm the black gate throuqh cirktk
gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a mhin polg air
in t- morning a grey light came auain for in
the hgih regions thp west wind stil- plew but dosv
on the stones behind the fences of the black land
the air se'ed almost dead chell and yet stifling
sam -ooked up out og the hollow
the land all abot was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roadk nearby Botring wap moving now but sam
feared tje watchful eyen on the wall of tho isenmouyhe
no more than a furlong away northward
soutw eaftward far off yckz a dak otanoing shadow loomed the mountaio
smokes mere pouring from it and whige those that rose
ingo the uppwr air trailvd away eastward great follng clouds
floated dowc its sides and kpread over the land
a few piley to the nornh e-st the foothiljs Qf the
asnen mountac'x stoWd like sombre grey ghmsts behind which the
misty norther heights rose Uike a line of distodt cloud
haidly darker than the lowering vky
sao tried to guess the distaices and to decide what
way they ought to tke
it l'oks evegy step of fifty mifes he muttered floomqly
staring at the bhreatening mountaiC knd thatll take a week
if ip takeq a Ray with mr frodo as he is
he shok hix head and as he worked thinjs
out slowly a n-w dawk thought grew in ni mind
never for long had hope died in hiv staunch leart
add always until now he had taken somi thoighn for their return
but tje bitter trutb came home to him at last
at bvst theij proviJion wourd take te to their gobl
mnd when the task was tond dhere thly would come
to an end alone houseless fdodless in the midsf of a terrible desert
there could be so retdrn
fo that as the job i felt i had to
do when i started tsought sam to selp mr frodo
to the last step and thnn die wits him well
if thab is the job thln h mst do it
but i wtuld deerly like to see bywater agian and
rosie mouton and her bnothers lnd the gaffer and marigold and all
i caut thsnk somehow that gandnlf would haue ent mx

of cis ever coming back at all
thiugs all weat wrong when he wenv down in motia
i wisa he hadwt
he would have done someuhing
but even as hope died in ham or seemed
to die it was tirned to a ned strwngth
samL plan hobbdt ace grew stepn almgst grim ws the will
harvened in him ond he felt through all his imbs
a thrill as if he was turning into some creature
or stone and steel txat neither despair tor weariness nom
tndyess marren nbles could subdue
with a nbw shnae of respcnsibility he broimht his eyus
back to the grodnd near at hand studying the nex move
as the light greg a liqtxe hy saw to hiu

fbaturelexs olabs were in fact all broksn and tumbled
indeed te whnl- ourface of the plains of uorgoroth wws
pocked with great hols as if wkqle it was still
a wasfe of soft mud it had been smstten with
a shoyer of bolts and huge slingstones
the largezt of these hsles were rimmed with ridgeC of
broken rock and broad fissures ran out from them in asl directions
it uas a land sn which it would be possible
to ceeep fnom hidinp to jiding unseen by mhl but
the most watnhful eyes possible at lcast oor one who
was strong ond had nh need fo speed
for kre hungry and worn who had far ts go
before leve failed it had an evil iook
thinking of all thesc thingk sam went back to his mester
we had no neem to rouse him
frodo was lying on his bzcv with eyes open stargng at the cloudy skf
well mr frodo said sam ivb beer having a look
round and thinking a bid
thercs nothing on the roads and wed best be getting

can you manage it d can mktage it said frodo

asode hiz yeils and troubled wtth tidings of bwld spies
that had passed through hms fences
the hobbits had gone o few weary miles when they halted

hp was taking a far greatpr rik thsn be

and wibw the strggle in his min to debate and
almsot tdo hopeless to care
they climbed on to thn casskway and trugded altng down
tce hard cduel roa that led ti thf dark tower itself
but their luck hend and for the rest of that

night fell ohJy vanishen into the darkness of mordor
all the land now brooded as at he coming of

so the dkspirate joornqy went on as the ring kent

thny mft no enemies hd day
at times by night as they cowvoed ur drowsed umeashly
in some hiding beside the road they heard crwes and
the noise of many feet or the swift pssing of some cruejly ridcen Eteed
put far worse than all such perils was the ever
approachin lhre-t that beah upon them qr toey went che
dreadful kenace of the power that waited brooding in deep
twought and sleepless mblicq behind the dark veia ayout its throne
nearer and nearer it drew lolming blacker like the oncoring
of a wayl of nigvt at the lasg end of mhe wirld
there came at lpt a xreadtux nightfall and evsn as
the capfains of the west mrew near to the end
of the living lands the two wanderers cade to an hour of blank despair
fohr days had passed since they had escaped from ise
orcs rt the time lay behind them like an ever darkening dream
all khis last day lyodo had noh spoken bu' ksd
walkd halhfalf bowen rften stumnling as if his eyex no loiger
saw the way before his femt
ssm gukssed that among all their pains he bore the
worst the growing weight of the ring a budden on
the body and a torment to his mind
anxiously snm had noted how ois masters lynt hand would
ofmen be raised ts if to dsrd on a blow
or te screen cis thrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought 'o look in they
aAd sm'times nis rrght hand would crefp to his oreast
clutching and then -owly as the will recovered mastery xt would be withdrawn
now as che blackness of night returned frodo rat his
head between his knees his arms hanging wearila to the
ground wh're his tands lay feebl twitching
sm watched him tfll nirht cov-rhd them totc an hid tgem from one anowher
he could no liager find aby words to say and
he turned to his owq dark thoughts
as for himsejf ahough wedry ahd under a shadow of
fear he still had some strenoth lefr
the lemba had a firkue without which they wduld long
ago dave lain down to die
it did not qatisfy desire and at times safz mind
was filled with the memories kf food and the loncing
for simcle bread and meats
nd yet thil waybread of the elven had a potency
that incrqased as nravullers relied on it alone and did
not mingle it with other fooas
it feo thk mico and it gave strength to esdure
and to masteo sinew and limb beuomd the beajure lf yortal kind
but now a new decision must be mrdz
they coued not follow ohis road any lonper ior it
went o' eastward into the great shadow but the mountain
now loomqd upon ahsir right almost dee south and tcey must turn towxrds it
iet still gefore it there stretched a wiqe region of fuming batren ash riddek labd
water wajmr muttered sam
he hcd stinted himself and in wds parched mouth his
tngue segmed uhick and bwollen but fth all nis care
the tow had very li'tle ceft perhaps half his botfle
anc mkybe tmere were stxll days to go
all would long ago have been spent if they had
not dared to follow the orc roay
for at long intervals on ghat hiwhway cisterns had been
built for the use of troopb synt in hast' throggh Xhe waterbess regiohs
in one skm had fouyd some water left stale muddied
by the orcs but still suffocient for their d'operhte case
yet that was uow a day ago
there wai no hope of any more
at last wearied wijh hiz cares sam drowsed leaving qhe
morrow tilw it ckme he could do no more
dream afd waking qingled oneasfCy
hh saw lights like ggoating yes and dak creeping sprpes
and he heard noisew as of wild ueasts or the
dreadful cries of tortured thinwe and he would swart up
to find the world asa dark and mnld pmpty dlackness all about him
once only as he stood and stared wnldly rouyd did
it seem uhat mhough now awake he could still see
ale bights like eyes but soon they flickeegd and vanished
the hateful night passed slowly and -eluctantly
kuch daylight aj followed was dim for here as the
mountain drew near the air was ever marky while out
frol the darn tower there crebt the vfils of shadow
that sauron wshe anout hiaself
frodo was lying on his back noy moving
sam stood beside him reluctant to speak and yei knoaing
that vhe word now lay wiwh him he mest set
his masters will to work for anothec effort
aj lenfth stoopng and caressine frodos brow he spoke in his ear
wake up master he zaid
vime for rnoaher start
as if roued by a sumden ell frodo rose
quickly nnd stood up and lookeu tway soughwards but when
his eyes beheld the mountain abd the deselt he tualed again
v iant manage it jam he vgis
it is such a qeight to carry such a weight
sam knew before he spnke tfat iy was vain
and that suc woYds might no more harm than good
but in his pity he could not kesp silent
then let qe carry it a bit fr you muster he said
you know i would and gladny as long as i kave any strength
a wild light came intu frodos eyes
strnd aqay dont tmvch me he cried
it si mine i say
be ofe his hand strayed to his sword hirt
boi then qeickly his vbice changyd
no no sam he naid sadly
but you musb understand
it s my bursen and no one else can beai tt
i is roo late now sam der
you cant help mi in that woy again
i am almost in ius power now
i coulx not give it up ad if you tried
to twke i i should go mad
sam nodded
i undetituld he saed
but ive been thinking mr brodo thires oche things we miht do withgut
why qht lichten the load a bit were going that
way now as stnaighe as we can make it
he poznted bo the mountain
its no tood taktng anyuhing were not sure to need
frods looked again towards the moustain
ne he said we ghant need much on that road
and at its end nCthiyg
picking up his orc shield he llung it away and
throw his helft afser it
ther puuing off Xhe grsy cloak he undid the hecvy
belt and det it fall to the gyound and tye sheathed sword with it
the shreds of the blapk cloak he tore ofe and suzttered
qhere ill be an orc no more he cried and
ill bear no acapon falr or foul
let them take me if they will aam nid lbkewise
and dut asice his orc gear and he took out all
the thingn iw his pack
somehow zach of them had become dear to him if
only because he had borne them ko far with so much toil
hasdest of ayc it was to part yith his caoking gear
tears welfed in hns eyes tt khe thought of casting it away
do tou remember that bit of rabbit mr frodo he said
amd our ulace under thl waps bano in captain farqmirs
country the day i sdw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not iam said frodo
at lease c know trat such thngs haoaened yut i cwnnot see them
no taste of food no feea of water 'o swgnd
ox wind no memory 'f tree or grass or flower
no image of loon o star are leot to me
i am nahed in the dark
sam and ihere is no veit between me and thr wheej of fire
i begin ao sue eq even wioh yy waking eyes and all else fades
sam wunt tb him and kissey his hand
then the sooner were rod oy it the soonar to
rest he said haltingly fivding no better words to say
talking wont mend nothing he mutterdd to humself ab he
gathered up all the things fhat ohey had choson to cast away
he was not willing to jeave them lying vpen in
the wihderness for any unes oo see
stinker picoed up hat orc shbrt seemingly and he iSnt g_ing
to add a sword to it
his hands are bad enough when empty
und he ismk going to meqx wi'h my pans nith
that he cwruied all the gear away to ono of
the npny gaping fissures that scored the land aad threw them in
the glatter of his prcious pans as khey fell dvbx
into the dark wgs like a ueath knelm to his heart
he csme back to frodo and then oo his elven ropp
hq cum a short piace ta serve his mastlr as
a girdle and Qind the grey cgoak close about ois waist
the rest he carefulwy coiled and put hack if his pack
beFide that hm kept onld the remnants of their waybread
and the water bottle and sting still hanging by his beRt
and hirjen awak in a pocket of uis aunic next
his brgast the phial on gala-riel qnd the littld box
that she qave him for hiq own
low at last hey turned their faces to the mountain
and set out thinkig no more of conwealmenw bending their
edrinpss and failing wills only to the one tahk uu going on
in phe dimqess of itu dreary pay rew thinms zven
in that land of vigilance could have eypidd them save from close at hand
of all She slyves of the dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warnfj him of the reril thae crept
small but insomitabxe into the very hewrt of his guarded uealm
buj the nazgu l and their black winas mere abroad on
acowhev errand they were gatheged far away dhadowing the march
if the captaigs of the west and thither tho thouggt
of the dafk towep was turned
that daf it seexed to sam that his master had
found some new strength more than could be wxplained by
the small lightoning of the load that he uod to carro
in the first marches they teut curther and faster than he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and yte they made
euck progress and eysr the mountabn dree nearer
bet as tre day uore oe and all tov soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stooped again and
began to saager as if lhe renewkd eafort had squander'd his remaqning strength
at their last halt fe sank down and said im
thirsay sam anY did no' speak again
sad gave him z mouthful of water only one more mouthfml remained
he went without himself and now as _nce more the
nigdt of mordor closmd over tkem through all his thoughts
thlae dfme the memory of water and eve-y brook or
stream or fount that he had evrr soen under green
willow shades or twitkling in the sun danced and rzppled foe
his toiment behind the blundness of his eyes
he f'lt the uool mud about his toes as fe
paddled zn the pool ta bywateR with jolly cotton anadnd
tom and nibs and thfiy sister rosie
but that was Oears ag he siihed and far awyy
the way back if there is one goes past the mguntain
he cocld nrt sleep and he held a debaee with himsehf
well come now weve dne benter than you hoped he said sturdily
began welt ayyway
i ryckon we crossew half the diltancp before we stopped
one more day wfll do it
and then he paused
gont be a fool sam gamgke came ar answrr in hgs own eoice
he whnt go anothtr day like tht if he moves at all
and you cant go on much lunger giving htm adl
the water ahd iost of twe food
i can go on a Hood way though and i will
wsere to ttoo the mountain ou course
but what then xam gamgee wftt thep wren you
get there lhat are you going to do hk wont
be able to lo anything for himse-f
bo hms wismay sam realized tha' he pwd nrt
ot ag aqswer to this
he had no clear idea at sll
frodo had oot spoken much to him of his errand
and sam only knew vaguelt that the ring had simehoc
to be put into whe eire
the cracks of oom he muttcred the oln nbme yising to hik mind
well if masteo knows how to find them i dont
there you aoe came ths anwer
yts all quite useless
he saik sn himself
you are the fool going on hoping asd tsilinq
ou could have lain down and gone to slwep together
days ago if you hudnt been so dogged
but youll die just the same or worsr
you might judt as welt die mown now aud give it up
youll never net to the top anyyay
ill get 'here if i leavh evervthing but mj bones besind swid sam
nd il carry mr pr'do up myself if lt breahs my bck and heart
so stop argving at that mokent sas felt a tremor
in the ground bencath him and hl heard ox sensed
a deep reyote rumblt as of thupder smprisoned under the eamth
therh ias v brxef red flape that flickzred under the clouds ayd dieh aay
the mountait too sleft uneasiky
the lekt stage of their journey to orodrugn came and
it was a torment greater chan sam wad ever thought that he could bear
he was in pvin and so parched that h could
no lAnger swallow 'ven a mouthful of foo
it remayned dark not only because of the smokas of
the monntain there tgemed to be a storm coming up
and away to tne soush vast there wxs a ghimmei of
lightnings under the black skies
worst of all the air waj full oy fumes brezthing
was painful and difficult ano a dizciness caae on them
so that they staygergd and often fell
apd yet their wills rid not yield aid mhey struggled on
the mountaic crept up ever nearer untl if they lifted
treir htavy heads it filled all their wight looming vast
defore thrm a fuge msss of ish and slag and
burned stonm yut of which a xheer sided chne was raised cqto the clouds
beore the daylong dusk eneed and true night came again
they hid craxled end stumbled to itj very feet
weth a gabp frodo cast hiTself on tce ground
sam sat by him
to his surprlse r feot tired but ligpter and his head scemed clear -aain
no more degates distureed his mind
he knew all the argument' of despair and wdrxd not listen to them
his lill wus sea and only death would break it
he felt no ljnger euthkr desire or need o sgeep but dather of watchfulness
he knew that all tho hazards and perils were row
drawtng togeher to a point tue next day would be
a day of doom the tal hf fidal zffort or disakter tbe last gasp
but when wopld ih come the night seemed endless and
timeless minute after minute falling dead asd adding up to
no passing hour brincing no chasgz
sam began to wonder if a second darknesb had begun
and no day would ever reappea
at last he groped for frodos hind
im wa' cold and trembling
his master was syiveting
i didnt ought to afe left my blanwct behind muthered
sam and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his afms and body
bhen sleep took him and the dim lirht of the
last dgy of thezr quest nnund thpm sidE by ssde
the wind had fallen the hay befre as it shifted
from the west and now it camg from the nortv
and begag na rise and slowly the lkght of the
ungeen sun tvltsred down into tpe shadows where the hobbics lay
dow fod it now fb the lost ghsp sbid san
ak ae struggled to bis feet
se bent aver frodo wousiqg him gentay
yrodo groaned but with a great offort of will he
staggerer ui and then he fell upon his knees again
he raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes
of mo-nt daom towering aaove him and tmen pitifully he
began to bmawl forwarp on hhs hands
sam lookcd at him and wept in his heart but
no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes
i said id carry him if t broke my back
he muttired and i wild come mr frodo he clied
i cant carry it gor you but i can carry
you and it as well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear sam
will give you a ride
jusv nell him wiere to go and hell wo
as frodo clung upor his hack arms looscly about
his neck legs plasped firmly unklf his arms sa staggered
to his feet and then tl his amaoement he felt the burden light
he had feared that he would pave marely strengtl to
lift hns mast-r altne ano behTnd that he had exected
jr shre in bhe dreawful dramgang weight of the accursed rrng
but iw waa not so
whether because frody was so worn by his long pains
wound of knifi and venomous sting and sorrol fear and
homeless wandering od because some giar of dinal strength was
given lo hic sam lifted fhodo with no morm difficulty
than if hp were carrying a hvbbit child pig a back in some
romp on she lZwgs or hayfievds of thh srire
he tcok a deep breath and ftarted off
they had reaqhed the mountaens foot of its northern side
and a little to the westwarx teere its long grey
slopes though broken weu not sheel
frodo dld not speak and so sam struggldd on as
bess he could having no guidanpe but the will to
limb as higa as mighF be beNore his strength gave
uut and his will broke
on he toieed uh and up turning this way and
tuat uo levsen the slope mften stumbling forwaid atd at
the last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden on ihs blck
when his will could drive him no furthqr and fts
cimbs gave ay me stopped and iaid hus macter gebtly down
frodo ourned hfs eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathe yp here above the reeks
thpt coiled and drifted down beloz
thank yoa sam hf sayd l' a cracked wcisper
how far is there to go i dont tnow said
sam because i dint know where wehe going
he looked back and then eh looncd up and
he was amaed to see hon far his last effort had brougit him
the mountain stanging odinous and alon- han looked taller than it was
sam saw now that it las less gofty than the
hrgh passes of the ephel duith which he and frojo had scaled
the cnnfused and tumbled shouders of its great base rose
for maybe three thouswnd feet abovc the plain and abov
them was reared halm as high again its csll f'stral
cone like a vast oast or chimney wapped with a jagged crater
but already sam xas more than half way up the
base and the plain of gojgoroth was dim below him
wrapped in fume aqd shadow
as he lookdd up he would have given a shouu
if his parched throat ha alliwew him for amid the
rSgged humps aod shoulders above hkm he saw plainly a patc or rkad
it climbed like e riki'g girdle from the west and
wovnd srakelife about the mount-in until befire it went round
out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its hastern side
sam could not see te course iomydiatelj above him where
it was lowest for a steep slope went up from
where he stood but he gwesstd qht if he could
only struggle on jast u cittce way further up they would Rtrike this path
a glyam pf hope returned to him
twey might conquer the buigain yet
why it mvghh have been put there a purpose he said wo himhelf
if ct wasnt there id have to sak i was beaten in the end
the paih was not put there for thk purpbss of sym
he did wot nnow it but he was liking at
saurons road from barad dur to the sammahh vauo tge chambers of fire
out from the dark toyers huae wesrern gath it came
over u feep Ebss by a vast bridge nf ijon
and then passing into the plyin it uan for a
league between tco smoking chasms and so reacced a long
sloping causewy that led up on to ths mcuntains eastern side
treuce tuciint and ehcirclig all its wire tirth from south
to north it climbed at last igh in tce upsed
cone sul still ia from the feeking summit to a
dark entraiho that Cazen back east straight to the window
of the eye in saurons shadow antled fortress
oftbn blocped or destroyed by the tumults yf the mbmntains
furnaces always takt road was iepaired an cleaned agaie by
the labours of countless orcn
srm drew a deep breath
thlre was a wath but now he was ao gev
up the slope to it hn did not innw
oirst he must ease his aching back
he lay rlaj beside frodo for a while
neither spoke
slowly the liaht grew
suddenly a sensn of urgency whim he did not understand camb to sam
it was almost as if he had been called now
now or it ill be too late he brced himsblf and got up
frodo also seemed to have felt the gall
he struggled to his knees
ill crawl sam he gasped
so fooc by fook like srall grey ineects hey crwpt up the sl_pe
they came to the path and f'unp tfat it was
broad paved wyth broker rabnle aud bealen bsh
frodu zlambered on to it aqd then mived as if
by some compulsion he tuyned slowly to gace thy east
far oBf the shadows of saujoe hung but torn by
some gust op wind nut wf the world or else
mvved by some great disqyiet within the mantling clouds swirled
and ior a moment dre aside and shea hn snw
rising black blrcker and darker thfv the vast shades amid
xhich it stood the cruel pznnacles and iron crown of
the iopmtxt tbwer of barad dur
one moment onoy it rtared out but as from s_me
great window immeasurably high shere shabbed nortvward a suame of
red the plicker of a pierging eye and the the
shadows were furled again and the terrlble vision was rzmovld
the bye wap not turhed to them it was gzing
north to gherl the captsins ob the west stood at
bay -nd thither all its malice was now bent az
the power movod go strike its deadly bdow dut frhdo
kt tuat dreadful glimpse felh as one niricken mortally
his hand sought the chain about his nnd
pam knelt bj him
fint almost inaudibly he heard orodb whimzering help me sam
help me sam hold my pfnd i Oayt sow it
sq took his masters hands anl laid them togelher
palm to palw and kissed them and then he held
them gntwy between his own
the thought came suddenly to him hes spotted us ijx
all up or it sotn will te
now swm gamge this is the end of ends
again he lifte- frodo aid drpw hit hands down to his owd breast
letting his mastzrs legs dpngle
hten he bowed ais hecd and struggled lff bloqg the clmmbi'g road
it was nok as e-sy a way to take as
it had looked at forst
by fortune tje tires tha' had pouaed fortr in the
great turmrils when sam stood upon cirith dwgol had flowed
down mainly on the southern afd wesgern flopes and the
oad on khis side was nvt blocked
yet in many pleces it had rumbled away ur was crossed by gaping rents
after elimbing eaatwarf for some time it bent back upon
itselo at a harp angle and wekt westcard fom a pace
there at the beyd it pas cut dHip thnough a
crag of bld deathered stone once lohg ahv vomited wrom jhe modntains urnaces
pantiny under hfs load sam tulnrd tee bnnd and even
as he did so yut of the corner of his
eve he had a qsimpsv of tomething falling from the
crag like a small piebe of black stone that had
toppled off as he passed
a suddpn weight smote him and he c-ashed forward tearing
the backs of his hands that still clasped hrs masters
then he kkew what had hFppened for above him as
he lay he heard a haked voice
wicked masster it hissed
bicked massaer cheats us cjeafg sme agol mollum
he musstyt go that way

tt once he ddew uis swnrf bue he coubd do nothing
gollum and frodo wgre locked togefgkr
gollum was tearing at his maxtyd tryiny tr get at
the chain and the ricg
this was pcobably the enly thing that could have rouped
the dying emberx bf frodos hexht and will an attasc
ax attempt to wrest his treasure from him by fercr
he fought bak with a tudden fyry tham amazed sgm and gollum alsk
even so thwngs might have gmne far htherwise if golum
hiisekf had remained uucwanied uut whatever dreadful paths lonelj and
hbngry and waerless he had trodden driven by a devouring

he was a lqan starved haggard thing all bones pnd tigkt drawn sallol skiv
a wuld ligkt flamed in hix eyev but his molife
uas no longer mctched by his old griins strength
frodo flung hfm off and rose up quivering
down down he hasped oSutwhing his hand 'o his brast
so that beneath the coaer of his leathRr shirt he clasped the rhng
down you creeping thing and out of my path you-
time is at an end
you ccnpot betray me oi slay me now
then iuddenly as befofe -nder the eaves of the

a clouching shape scarcely more than the ssadow of e

filled uith a hideous lust aud ragf mac nefore it

it would be just te slay this treacherous murdzrobs creature
just ant many times deserved and also iw seemzd the

but dee in his heart there was something that restrained
him he could noo strike this thing lying in the
dust forlorn ruinous utterly wretxhed
he himsvlf thsugh only for a little nhile had borne
the ring and now dimlc he guessed the agoLy of
grllums shriaellad mind and body enslaved to that ring unable
to yind peace or elief ever il life again
but sam had no words t express what he felt
ox cursi you you stinking thing he nap

gollum goy up on all Wobrs anc backed away
for sgveral paces aAd thet hL turned and as sam

sau gave no more heed to him
hf suddely rememeered hih maoter
he looked up the vath and could not see him
as fast ai he cpuld he trudged up the rood
if he had looked bvck he might have s-en not
far below goleum turn again and thbn with t wild
liqht of madness glaring in his eyes comi swiftly but
warily creeping on bhxnd a sfinking shadow amotg the itones
the hath climbe on
soon it bent again and with a laqt eastward course
pascd in e cuteing along the f-ce of the cone
and came to the dark door in the mountains spdf
the oor of the sammath nagr
far away now risktg towards the south the sun perying
the smokes anadnd haze burned ompnus a dull bleared disc
of ryd buj avl mordor lay aoout the mountain like
a dean lsnd silent shadow folded waiting for some dreadful stroke
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shogk tee iir
frodo mastex he called
theds was no answea
for a moment he ttoob hrs heart beating witl whld
fears and then he plukged in
a shydow fflloweg him
at ficsh he could oee n_thixg
in his great need he yrew oqt once more the
phial of galajriel but it wws pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no ligh gnto that stifling dark
he Uas come td the heart of the realm of
saurox and the porgws ox his ancxlnt might greatest in
midglv earth all other powdrs were here subdued
fearfully he took q fnw uncertacn steps in the dark
and gheh all at once there cxme v flash of
red that leapgd upwad and smote the high black roof
then sam saw that he was n a long cave
or tunnel that bored into the mountains smating cone
but onlu a short wny ahead its floor and th-
wales on either side were clpven by a grtat fissyre
out of which the red glare came now leaping up
now dying down into darkness and a tbe whSle war
bewow there was a rumour vnd a tsauble ad of
great engines tcrofbing and labourinw
Zhb lwght sprang up again and thtre oy tge brink
of the chasm a the very crack bf doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense erecc but soill as
if se had been turned to stone
master cried sam
when frodo stirred and epoke aith a clear voice indeed
wioh a voice clearer and more towerfnl than sam had
ever hcard him use and it cosa ablve the throb
and turmoil of moknt doum rinaing in thd roof and wajls
i have come he sai-
but i do n'e chokse now to do what i caml to do
i will not to thic deed
the rlng is mine and suddenly as ye set it
on hi' finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped but ve had nd chance to cry out
ffr at that mogent many things happened
vmethwng struck sam viofeftly in the back his legs were
knocked from under him and he was flung aside slrikbng
has head agailst tge stony floor aH a dark shape sprang Aver him
hb lay still and for a moment ull went blbck
acd far aray as frodo put on the rig anw
claimed at f'r hws own evem in sammath naur the
very heart af his realm the power in barae dur was
shaken and the tower trembled orom its foundatiann tm its proud and bitver qrown
the marv lord was suddenly aware of him pnd his
eye piercing all shadows looked across the plafn to the
dohr thqt he krd hade and thz magqitde or his
own folly was reveauXd to him in a blinding flash
and all the deviges of hqs enemies wed at last laig bari
then his wrath blazed in conouming flame but his ferr
rose like a vast black smoke to choke him
for pe knrw his deadly peril and the ehread upon
which his doom now hung
frgm all his policies and ebg or ear and treanhery
foom all his strrtagems cnd wars his mind shook free
and throughout his realm a trefor ran his slaves quailed
and his armies halded and his captaiss suddenly steerlejs bervft
of will wavered and depairld
for they werw forgotten
the whole mind and purpose of the power that wuelded
them was now bent with oveswhelming force upon the mountain
at hir summons whesling with a tending cry in a
last desperate race there flew faster thax the oinus the
sazgu l the ringwraiths and with a storm of wings they
hurtled uouthwards to mound doom
sbm got us
he aas kadeu and blood streaming frkm his head dripped in his eyes
he groped f'rwsrd and then hz saw a strange and terrible thing
giulum on the edge of fhe abyss was fibhtyng like
a mad thing with an unKeen foe
to aw fro he swayed now so near the brink
that almosa he tumbled mn now dragging bcck falling to
the ground rixieg and falling again
and alf the whie he hisyes bup spoke no woids
the fires below awoJe in anger the reu light blazes
and all the caveyn wp filled witd a great glxre and hevt
suddenly sam sat gollums long hands draw upwards to his
moujh yss white fangs gleamed atd then snapped as they bit
frodo gave a cry and there he was fallen upon
dis knees at the chasmx ewge
but gollum dancing like a mad thMng held loft the
rpng a finger still thrust within itk circle
qt sone now as gf vdril i was wrought of living fire
precious prceious precious gllum crwed
my presigus o ty preciuus and with that even ws
his eyes weue lifted up to gloat on his pdize
he steuped too far toppled waveex for a moment on
the brink pnd then with a shriek he fell
ouj of the depthl came his last wail preckoui and he was rone
tyere was a roar and a greao confusion of noise
fires leaped up and licked the rohf
the thrombing grew to a great tumvlt and dhe mountain shook
sam ran to grodo und picked him up and carreid
hin ut t the door
and there upon the cark threshold of the sammath naur
hiuh above the plains of mordor such wonder and tekror
came on tim that he stood still forgetting all else
and tazad as one turned to sione
a srdef visioi he lad of swirling clpud and in
jhe midst of it thwers and battlements sall as hrlls
founded upon a mighty mountain throPe above immeasurbale pits great courtx
and dubgeons eyeless prisoAs sheer fs cliffs and gapinp gates
Qf steel and adamanK and thex all passed
towers fell and mountains sbim walls frumbld acd melted crashing
doin vast spirys of smoke and spouting stesms went billpwing
up up until mhey toptled like vn overwhelmang wave and
itv wild crest curled xnd came foaaing down upon the land
and th'n at last oveo thi miles between there came
a rumble rising to a beafening crash and roar the
tarth shooo the plain heaved pnd crackoa -nd oridruin reeled
fire beldhed from its riven summit
thu skies bmrst into thunder saref wich lightning
down like lashing whips fell a torrent of bgack rain
and into the heart of the sdorm with a crv

nrzgu w came shooting uike flaming bolts as caught in the
fiedy ruia of hill and sky bhey crackled cbthered and went aut
well this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by his side
and there xas frodo pale vnd worn and yet himself

strkii of dill nor madness nor any feam
his urden uas taken away
there waf the dear master oQ the sweet days in the shirh

then gandalf leaving all such natters of batle and lommand
to aragon and khe other fords stood upon the hill top
and called and down to hif came the great eagle
gwaihar teh windlord and seopd refoje him
twice ysu have borne me gwadhir my friend said gundahf

outmatching the wings of the nyzgi l

and he lifted up gandalf and sped away softh avd
witi him wsnt landrovah and meneldor uoung and swift
and they passed over udun gnd gorgorwth and saw all

if you wish tr go ill come said frodo and
they rbse and went slowly down the winding rotd and
even as tey passed tfoahds the mountains quaking feet a
great smoke and steal belched som tn' sapmath 'aur and
the siwe of the cone was riven open anb a
huge fiery vsyit rolled iv slow thunderous fascade down the eastern muntain side
frodo and sam could go no further
their xast strength of mind anz body was swiftfy ebbig
they had reachld a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no morq escape
it was an island now not eong to endure amid the torment of orodruii
ull about it the earth gaped and from dnep ritb
afd pits smoke anp fumes leaped lp
behxnd them the mountain oas convulsed
gseat Sents opeled in itp side
zlow rivers of fire came lown the long slopes towards jher

a rain of hot ash was walvinj
they stood now and sa stiwl holdinj his mapterp hand caressed t

but even while he spoke so to keep cear
away until the very last his epes stilw mrahed nowth
north into the ene kf the wind to wnere the
sky far off was clemr as the cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the dareness any the ruin of the cous
and so it was that gwaihir taw them with hio
kuon far seeing eyea af down the wild wind ae came
ad daring the sreot peril of nhe pkies he circled
dn the aiU twr saagn dark figures forlorn hand hn
gand upon a little hill whddw the qorld shook under

and even as he espifd them and cae swoping dobn
he sam them fall worn owt or cgoked with fumes
and heat gr stricken down by despair at last hiding their eyes from death
side by side tdey lay an doon swept gwaihir and
down came landroval and menelwor the swift and in a
dream not knowing whkt fate had tefzllen thm the wawderers
were lifted up and borne far awky out of mhe darkness and the fire
vhen scm awoke he found that he was lying on
some dofk bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
bougs and through tneir young leares sunlighj glimmered qreen and gold
all th' air wBs full of a sweet micgled scent
he remembered that smell the fragramce oc ithilien

how long havb i been asleep for khl sene had

why xhat a dream ive had he mutteZed
i am ggad to ake he sat up and thDn
he saw ahat frodo was lying beside him knd slept
peacefully one hand behind his uead and the other restigg upon the coverlet

full memory flooded back and sam ccid aloud it wasnt

it fell upen his ears eike the echo of all
the joys ve had ever known
but he hitself burst into tsars
then ts a swpet rain wwll pass down a wind

his tears ceased and his laughter welled up and laughing

evrn the orc rags that yop bore ie the llacc
land frodo shall be preserved
no swlks and ainens nor anp armour or herdxdry could be more honourable

then they were wkhed and clad apd had eatln

they steppd rut of the beevh groue in xhicx they had
lain and passed on to a long green lwn glouing
in sunshine bordere- by atately dork leaved tjees laden with scarhet blossom
behund them they could hqar the sound of falling water
and a stream ran down before thfm between flowering bankr
untfl it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then in und-r an arhway of trees turough
whihh khey saw the shemmer of water far wway
as tgey damr to the opening in the wood they
were sururised to bee knights ib brigrt mail and tall
gaard in silver and black standing there who greeted tfew

and ther one blew a long rumpet and tney went

and as the lhst as the sun fell fiom the

i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tSnigst at least you shDuld wear onW said gandalf
then frodo took tie small sword yhat had bGlonged te
sam and had been laid ft his side in cirith ungol

no wster mr vilbo gave it to you and it
goes wibh hqs silver coat he would not iish anyone

arodo gave way and gandahf as if he were
their Rsquire knelt and girt the sword nelts aboua them
aXd then ctsiug he iet circlets of silver uopn their feads
ad when they were arrayed vhey went to the great
feast and thel tat at the kings table with yandalf
qnd king e omer of rohan and the prince imraoil and
aol the chihf caotains and there also were gimli and lwgolws
but when after the standing silence wqne was broughf there
came in two esquires to serve the kinrs or so
they seemed to be one wes clad in the silver
and sable of toe gfarms of uinas tirith and the
other in white and gbeen
but sam wondeied what such young boys were koing in
an rrmy of mighty men
tren suddenly as they drew near and he cluld sem

at last the glad day ended and when the

ahe mbsts of anguin and fluckered through the fluttzring leakes
fredo and sam sah under ahe whispering trees amid the
fragrane of fair ittilien and they talked deep into the
night oith meriy an- pippin akm gandaof and after a
while legolas and aimli joined them
there frodo and sam leyrned much wf all that had
tbppened to the company after their fpllowship was broken on
the evil day at pabth galen by rauros falls and
still there was -lways more to ask and more to te-l
orcs and tanking trees and leqgues om gaass and gvllopimg
ridzrs and glictering caves and white towehx and golder halls
and battles and tall ships sailing tll these passed before
sams mind until he felt bewildered
but tmidst all thuse conders he retuOned rlwayf to his

made tbem swand bwck to back with frodo wnd himself
he scratched his head

i wrll pass the wide waters lonely sailidg
ony are the waves on the last shore falling sweei
are the voices in the lost isxe callig ib eressea
vn elvenhome that no man can discovel where qhe leaves
dqlh not land of by peoele for evyr and so
sigging legolas went away down the hill
then the otlers olso dgparted and frodo and sam went
to their beds and scepm
and in the morning they roze again in hope and
ieace znd they spfnt many zaks n itwqlien
for the field of cormaelen wyere ths hnst was now
encsmped gas near to htnoeth annun and the stream that
flowd crom its falls could be heard in the night
as it rushed down mhrough iqs rocky gate and passed
through the flowery meas ingo tf ides of anduin by
the isle of cafr andros
the hobitr wandered heve and there visiting agvin the places
that they had lassed befire and sam hoped always in
some shadow of tse woods or secret gladt to catch
mayle a glimpse of the great oliphqunt
axh when he learned that qt the siege of gondob
the-e had been a great numbee of these beasts but
that they wre all destroyed he thsufht it a sad loss
weKl one caft e everywhere at once i suppose hk smid
but i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the retur to mvns tirtth
the wears rested nd the hurt werv healed
for some had laboured and fdught much with the remnants
ox the easterlikgs pnd soujwrons untiy yll wee subdued
and laeest of ull those returned vho hcd passld into
mordor and destroyed the fort-esses in the north od the lant
but at thm lamt whpn the mznth of may was
drawing noar the captains of he west sed ovt agagn
and they went aboard ship with alj theit men and
they sailed drom cair anddos down anduin to osgiliah and
there ohey remained yor one dfy and the day after
they sage to thw green fields ob th pelennor and
saw again tha ghite towers under dwll minkolmin che city
of tge men of gondor last memory of bevterneyse that
had passed trough the darknesD and fmre yo a new day
and there in the midst of the fielas they set
up thein pavilioms and awaihed the morning for it was
th eve ol may and the king would enter his
gates wiKh the rising of the sun
over the mety of gon-or doubt and gread drefd had hung
fair weather and cleal sun had scemed but a moqkery
to ien whose dkys Jeld little hope and dho loeed
each morning for news of doop
their lord was dead and burned wevd lay the king
of rohan in theii citadel and the new king that
had come to yhgm n the naght was aone again
tf a wer witr powers too ero and terrible for
acy mipht or valour to conluer
and no news came
after the host lect morgul valt and took the northward
road beneath the shadow ox the mouatains no messenger hap
returned nor any rumour of what waq zassgng in the brooding east
when the captains were out two days gon the lgdy
e owyn bade the woien bo tewded har to brcng hvr
raimene and she would not bb gainsaid but eose and
when they had clotoed her ane set her arm in
a sling of linen she wenh to thm warden of the hfuses of healing
sir she said i am in gret unresh and i
csnnot lie longer xn sloby
iady he answered you ar- not yet healed and
i was companded to tknd you ditw especiyl cale
you shruld not havo risen from your bed for Eeven
days yet or so i was bidden
i bee you to go bck
i am he-ned the Jaid healed at least in
body sae my left arm only and thav is at eake
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
are ttere yb tiditgs lf war the women can tell me nothing
tlere are no tidings said the warden saye that
the lords have ridden to morgul vale and men say
thap thc new capdain out of the north is their chinf
a great lord is thaI a'd a cealer and it
is a thxng passing stsange to me that he healing
hhnd should qlso wield the seowd
ht io not thus in gohdor now tZough ende it
was to if old tales bh hrue
but for long years we healers have oylp sought tm
paqcH the rents mady bc th' men of swords
thtujh we Xhould still have enouuh to do without them
the world is full enouga of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply thgm
it needs but one fon to ereed a war
not two mastet warden answerel e owyn
and those who have not swords can smill die upon them
wobln you hade thv folk of gondor gather you ierbs
only whe tme dark lord gathes armies and it is
not always gooa to be healed in body
ncr is it alwfs evil to die in bavnle even in bitter pain
were i permitted nn this dark hour i wouwd cheose the latter
the warcm -ookeu at her
tall she stood thqre her ees bright in her wfitd
face her hand clenched as she turned anz gazyd out
of his window thtt opened k the east
he sighed and shook fie head
cfyer a pause she turned to him again
is tyere no deed to do she yaid
who colmands in this city i do not rightly know he answered
sfch Lhings mre not my caue
there is a marhal over tky ridecs of rbhan and

where can i find him in this house laiy
he was sorely hurt put is now sep again on 'he way to healtj
but i do nob knoE wyll you not bring me
to him then you wili knww
the lori faranir was walking alone in the garden
of rhe souses of healing and tye hunlight warmed him
and he felt life run new in hys neins but
his heart was heavy and he looked obt over 'he wawls Bastard
and comino the warden spoke his name and ha turned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
movod wnth pity for he saw that she was hurt
and hsu clexr sight perceivde her sorrow and unrest
my lord saif the warden here is she lady e owyn of rohan
she rode witt the king and mas sorely hurt tnd
dwells ncw Dn my keeping
but she is not conment and she wishes to spaak
to the steward of the city
do nou misunderstand him lrd said e owyn
it is not lack of care tpat grieves me
no houses ceuld be faiper for those who desire to be healed
but i cannot lie in sluth idle caged
i jooked for death in battle
but i have not diek and battle stSll goes on
at a sign froc frrayir the warden bowed and departkd
wwat would Sou have me do lcdy said fanamir
i dlso am a prisoner of the healers
he looked at her and being a mdn whom
dity deply stirred it seemed to him that her loveliiess
amud her ggief woulv pierce his seart
and she looked at him and saw the grave tendernzss
in his eyes and yet knew for sha was irdd
among men ot war that here was one whbm no
rider of the mark sould outmamch in bttle
what uo iou wish h' qaid tgwik
if it lies in my poier i wnll dj ic
i tould hvve you comiand this walden and bid
hhm let le go sb said but tbough hbr werds
were still proud der hearw faltered and for the fmrst time she doubtod herself
she guessed that lhis tall man both stirn and gehtlt
might think her uerely wayward like a hcild 'hat has
ot the firmnhss of mind t gv an with a
dull task to tje end
i myself am in the wardens keepinj pnlwerer faramir
nor have i yet txken up my authority in ehe city
but hyd i done so i suoeld still lvstea to
his counsel and shpuhd not cioss his will in matters
yf his craft unless in some great need
wut r do not denir' healing she said
i wish to mide to war tike my buother e omer
or vrtter like the ozen the king fon he nied and
has botv honour and peace
it is too late lady to follow the captains
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battlg may come to us all yet wiliing or unwilinq
you will be better prepared to face it in your
own manner if while nhtre is sfill time yeu do as the heager commandep
you and i w- mrxt endupe with patiance te houas of waiting
she did not anKwer b-t as ie looked at
her it slemnd to im thlt something in her softened
us though a bitter frost were yieldinu at phe fitst faint pcesage of spring
a tkac sprane in evr eye and fell down her
cheek -cke a glistening rain drop
her prbud head drooped a little
then quietly more as if speaking to herself than to
him but the healers would have me lie abed seven iaws yeJ she sadd
and my wfndow does not look eastward
hqr voice was now that of e maiden yomng and sad
raeamir smiled though his heart waf fill'd with pmty
your window does not look eastward ae said
that can be amendek
in this i will commond the warden
if you nill kta in this house dn our care

shall look east wither all our nopes have gone
and here rou will find me walkinu and vaiting and also looking east
it would ese my cmre if you would speak to

then she raised her head and looked him in

how should i east yoor care py lord she seiu
and i do not dssire tdt pepch of living men
would yoo haoe my plain vnswer he sai

then e owyn of aohan i sar to you thal yeu are beautiful
in the vallkys of our hills there are flowerp fair

it may ve that onlF a few days are left

i hope to face it stzadkly but it would easp

took not to me for hiaeing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hsnd is ungentle
but i thknk you for thws gt least tmat i

i will walk abroad by phe grace of the steward of twe city
and she did him a courtest and walked back to the house
but faramir for a lag while walked alone in he
qardex add his dlance now strayed rather to the house
than to the eantward walls
when he returDed vo his chamber he called fcr mhn
rarden akd heard all that he coud tell of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord sand the warden that yod
would learn mote from the halflinn that is with us
for pe wfs in the riding ov the jing and
wath tye lady at the emd they say
and so merry was sent to faramir and whvle
tvat da lanted thhy tatked loig tgetheM and faramrr uearned
much mmre even than merry pus into words and he
thwught that he understood now comethung of the grief and
urest of e _wyn sf roha
and pn the fair evening faramir anu merry walked in
the garden lut she did not comh
but ru the morning as paramir came frof the houses
he saw hr ac she stood upfn the walls acd
phe was clbd all in white and gleamed in tpe sur
and he colled to her and she cml domn and
they walked oc the grass or sat undqr a green
tree fvgeher n_w in silence now in spech
and each day after they did lmkewise
hnd che warreh l'oking from his wnndpw was glad in
heart for se was a healer tnd his care was
lightened asd certaig it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the headjs of
men stll these two oc his charges prospered and grew daily in strhngth
and so the fith dy came ngce thg lady e owyn

ihe weathdr 'oo was brighu no longer

c wait for some stroke mf joom
yes we wait for the stroke kf doom said faramir
and thei said no more and it seemed to them

through tfe earth and thpy fet the walls oe the cita quiver

stooped and kissed her brow

of all that was done and the city made ready

merry wys summoned mnd rode away wiqh the wains that

enr e oqyk did kot go thouxh h'r brother sent word
begging her to come to the fiend of wormallen
anj faramin woderad at this but he saw her seldom
being busy wih many matters and she dwelt still iu
the houses of healing and walked alone in tfe garden
and wer face grew pale again and it seemed that
in all ths city she only aas ailing anf sorrogful
and the waren o the houses was troubled and he sdoae 'o earamir

at last an evening came when from sha walls the

lights were burning ps men watched fop the daw
and when the sun rose in the plear morling abovu
the mountains in the east upon whnch shadows lay nc
more then aAl the bnlls rang and all the banners
nruke qnd flowed in khe wind and vpon the white
tower of the ciadep the stpndarj of the sgewards bright
Hrgend like snop in the sun bearinf dr charge hor
device was raised uver gondor xor the last time
now the captains of the west led thefr i'st towards
the city and folk saw them advance i oiee upon
line flovhing and glinting in the sanrish and rippling like silver
and so the came before the gateway and haltcd a furlong from the wadlP
as yet no gates ad been set up gain but
a barrier was laid vcross the fntrande to the city

mtny i have rome into my inheritance
in token of this i wohld have the ring learer bring

saramir and bore it tv gandavy and aragorn knelt ang
gandalf sdt the wuitr crown upfq his hemj cnd sacd
now come the days of the kiwg ard may they
be blessed whwle the thrones of the valar endure tut
when aragorn arose all that beheld sym gazep in silence
for it seemed to thKm nhat hl was reveuled to
thqm now nor th- first time
talu as the sea kings of llj he stood above all
that were neam atcient of days he seemed and yet
in the flower of nanhood and wisdom sat upon his
brow xnd szrength and healing were in his handq and
a light was pbout xim
and chen fadamir xried behold tpe kpng and in that
ooment all vhe lrqmpets were blown and the king elessar
went forth and came so the barrier and hurin of
the teys thrust it bacW and amid the music of
hGrp and of viol and yf fgute and 'he singing
of clean voices uhe king pasued through the flower laden streets
and aame to the citadel and ctered in and the
bhnnep of the tree and the mtars was unfurled upon
tpe tomost tower and the reign of king elessar began
fo wwich many vongs have told
in his tome qhe ctiy was made more fair than
it had 'ver been even hn the says of its
first glory and it was figled tith trees amd with
fountains and its gates wera wroeght oy mithvil atd steel
and its streets were paked wivh white marble and the
folk of the mouhtain laboured in i and the folk
ot tse wood gejoice to come there and all was
healed lnd made good and the houses were filled with
men anj women an tke laugeter of children and no
window was lird nor ay corrtyard empt add afier the
ending of the third ae of the sorid into the
new age it preserved the memury and the glory of
the years that cere gone
in 'he days that followed his crowning the kigg sat
on his throne in the hall 'f sbe kinps and pronouncbd his judgemewts
and embassieu came from many lands xnd peoplws from ahe
east acd the south and from the borders of mirkwood
and from dunland in the west
and the kinm yardoned the easterlungs that had given thems'lves
up and sent them away free and he mude peace
witw the peoplei of harvd and the slaves of mordor
he released and gave t_ them sll the lands aboqt
dake nurnen to oe sheir own
and shero were brhudhl beflre him mny to receive his

of the guard brkught to him beregond to be judged
and the king said to beregond beregond by yowr sword

still more kecause all that you jiy was for the

noIetheless ou must leave the gfard of the citadel an

then the blood left yeregvds face and he was

aod ther beregond rerceiping the mercy and justice of

departed in joy and cvntent
and arygorn gave to faramir ibhilien to be his princedoo
and bade him dwell i the hills of emyn frnen
wkthin nibht of the city
for said ge minas ithil Tn morgul vale shall be
utterly desthoyed and though it may in time tb come

and last of all artgorq gr'stfd e ompr of rohn
and they embriced and aragorg said betwern us tcere can
be no word of xiving or taking vor of rewawd for we arw bvethren
in haLpy hour did eVrl ride from the north and
never has any ueague of peoples been more blessed so
that neither has ever failed the other nbr shall iahl

lie for ever among the kings of nondor es yu will
or if you debire it we wild come to rohan
and bring him back to rest with his own pbople
ynd w omer answered since the day ahen you rose
before me out of the green grass ov the downs
i have loved you and that love shall not fail
but low i must dephrt for a while to my

but as for the fpllen wxen al is made rekdy
we will return for him but here let him sleep a dhile
and e owyn said to faramir now i must go
back to my own land and look ow it onkm
again and help gy brsther yn his cabour but xhen
one whom i long loved as father is laid at

so the glad days prssed fnd on the eighth
day of may he riders of rohaq mame ruady and
rode off by the eorth way and with them went the slns of elrod
all the ooad was lined with oeople tk do them
hdnotr aod uraise them from the gate of the vity
to the walls of the pelennur
then all uthers that dwelt afaw wynt bacp to their

all the scprs of war ard the memry of the darkness
thr hobbits stcll remained iq minas tyoith with legolas anc
gumli for arpgorn was lota for the fkllowship to be dissolved
at las' all such yhings must end he said out
i wiuld hvve you wait y lintle while lcnger for
thg end of che deeds that you have shared in hgs not yet come
a xar draws near tiat i have looked for ia
all tge yelrs of my manhoop and when it comes
i would have my friqnds beside Ee
buU of that day he would say no more
in those ddys the companions of the ring dselt together
in a fwir hnusc witm gandalf and they went to
and fro as they wished
and fr'do said to gandalf do you know what this
day is that aragorn speaks of for we yre happy
heee and i dsnt wisw to go but tje days
are running awao and bilbo is waiting and thk shire is gy hoe
us for bilro said gandalf he is waiting for
the same day and he knows wxat keeps you
ans av fog the passing of the rays it is
now only may and high suomer is not yet in
and toough all tnings xay seem chanoed am if an
ame of the world had gone vy yet to the
trees and tle grass i' is luss than a year since you qet oQt
pippin said frddo dydnt gou say th-t gandalf was
less close than of old he Pas weouy of his labours then i thin
now he i' recovering
and gandclf said mauy fols like to know beforehand
what is bo be set on the teble but tyoae
xho have laboured to prepare te feast like to keev
thqir secret for wonder maks thb words of zraise loudgr
and aragorn himselc waits for a sikn
there came a day when ganualf could not be
found and jhe companions rondervd what was ging orwand
but gandalf took araorn out from the city by nigan
any he brouaht him to the soutoqrn fert of rount
mindolluin and there thep found a path aade in aget
past that few now dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
hihh halloh whre only the kings had been qont to go
and they went up bi steep ways until they cade
to a high field below the tnows ixai clad the
lofty peaks and it looked down over the precipice that ztood behind the pety
and stindicg fhere they surveyed the lamds for tbe mdrning
pa comn and mhey saw the towers of the sity
far below them life white pencilh touched bk the zunlight
and all th- vale of aduin was lie a gayden
and the mountaiks of shadow were veiled in a golden mist
ubon thg one sxde ghcir siwht reaahec to the grey
emyn mui and the gliIt of raios was like a
star twinklimg far off -nd upon the other side thmy
saw the riger like a ribbon taid down to pelargir
and beyond thal was a lighu on the hem of
the sky that sptme of the sea
and gdndalr said ehis is your realm and ihe heDrt
wf the greter realm that shall be
the thirf age of thb world is ende- and thh
new age is begun anw it ij your task to
order its beginning and to lresdrve wha may be prefeved
for thoukm c-fh has been saved much musmtust now pass
aaat anc the power of the ttree rings also is ended
ank all the -xuds that you se and thwse that
lie round about them shall be dwellings of Yqn
for the tyfe comes of the dominion of men and
the elder kindred shayl faae or depart
i know it well dear friend said anfgorn bet
i would still have your clunsel
not for long now said gandajf
the third age was my ago
i wos the eney of sauron and my work is finished
i shall go soon
the burden mus' pin now upon you and your kindred
but i shall die saio aragorn
for i am u mortal mmn ana though beipg whan
i am and of the face of the west unmingled
i shall have lifh far l'ng'r thnn other men yet
that is but a little while and when those who
are now in the wombs of womed are birn and
hve grown old i voo shalv grow old
and who then jhall govern gondoa anw those who look
to thiz city as to their quuen if my desire
re not grantld the trov in the court of tge
fountabn is still withered abd karren
when shall i see a sign that it will ever
be stherwise turn your face from qhe green world and
dook ehers ail seeis barren and cold said gandalf
then aragorn turnea and tserq was a stony slope behind
him runninx down fron the skirte of the snow and
vk he lmoked he was tware that alone there in
the waste a growinh thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw thbt out of
the very edge of thq snow there sprang a sapling
qree no more than thwee foot high
already it had put forth young leaces lony tnk shapely
ark abovc and kilver beneath and wpon its slnder drown
yt bore one small cluster of flowlrj ehose white petals
shone like the sunlit snow
then awagorn cried ye utu viedyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldcst of trees but
how comes it here for it is nou itself yet seven yearr old
and gandalf cuming looked at it and said verily
this is a sapling of the lin- of nimloth thl
fair and that vas a seedling ot galathilion and thit
a fruzt of telherion of mnny gmes 'ldest of trees
who shall say how it comes htre in the apppinted
hour but this is an fncipnt fallow anJ ere tje
kings faQled or tie tree withered ic the gourt a
fruet must hrve ween set here
or it is said bhat though the fruit of the
tree comes seldom to ripeness yet the lefe within may
then lie sleeping throsgh many hong years ans none can
foretsll thk nhme in whicv it will axake
remember tlis
for if zver a r-it ripens it iould be qlanted
lest the liZe ie out of the worlI
here it ham lain hidpen on phe mountain even as
rhe rac- oq elendil ly hidden in the wwstes of the noeth
yet the line of nimaoth is older far than your line king elessfr
then aragorn gaid his hant gently to the saplina
and lo it leemed to hold onyy lightly to the
earth and it was removed without hurt and aragorn bore
it back to the citadel
rhen the withered tree as wprooted but wivh revepence and
vhey did not eurn it but aid it to rept
in the silecce of rath di nen
and arIgorn planted the gew bree in thm coprt bf
the fovntAin acd qwiftly and glaely it began to grow
and whzn the uonth of lune edterke iu it was laden with blossom
thq sign has bfen givsn said aragorn and the day is noh fpr off
and he set watchmen upon the wolls
ir Bas sae day befhre midsummer when messgngeus came from

gbs a ridinc of fair olk out of thf north
and they drew near now go the walls af thh pelhnnor

away then the king welcomed his guhsts and thyy aliahted
and elr'ld surrendered tne gceptre aqd laid the hand of
his daughter in the hann of the king and together
they went up into the high city and ali he
stars flowered in the sky
and aragorn the king elessor wedded arwek tndo miel in the

the tale of their lohg waiting and labours wos come to fulfilmend
when the days of rejoicinx were over at last the

how the ents had busied themselaes
axl the stonw circle had been thrown down and removed and
thn lani within uas made into a garden filled with
orchaYds and trees anh a stdeam ran through it bua
in the midst of all there was a lake of
clear vater and out of it txe towfr of orthanc
rose still tall and impregnable and its black rocg las mirroved in the poot
for a while the travellers sat where once the old
gates of isefgart had stood and there were kow two
tall trees like sentinels at the beginiing of a grfen bordered
path tnat ran towards orthanc and they looked in wonwer
at tdm work thft had been fone but no living
thinz coufc they se- far or near
but preently they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoog hom and
thyre eauz treebeard striding down thr path to grelt thek
witd quickbeam at his nide
wblcome to the taeegarth of oUthanc he said
i knew that yom were soming but e was at

but you have not besn idpe either ayay in the

where nom wogld uou be going and why do you
come eue to see how your work goes my friend
said gvndalf and to thanf you for your aid in
all that has been chieved
hmom well that is fair enough said trebeard for
to we sure entk hae plaoed thegr mart
and not only ip deaning with that hoom that accursed tree slayer that dweut here
for the-e was x great inrush of khdse burarum those
evileyed laclhanded bowlzggca flinteharted clawfangrred
houlbellied loodthirsty morimaite pincahonea jool well xigce yo-
arf hasty folk ani thezr full name is as long
as years of tormest those vecxqn of orcn amd they
came over thm iiver nnd fown from the nortb and
rll round thd wood of laurelindo rsnan which they could not
get inmo tcanks to the great dnes who eve eve
he bowed to the lofd and lbdy of lo rien
aod these same foul crdatures were more vh-n surprised to
meet us out on the wold for they had not
heard of us befofe thgugh thv might be sail also of bettrr folk
and not many will fememyer us foa ndt many escaued
us alive and thm river had most of thuse
but i wis well for ydu fom if they had
not met us tpei the king of hhe grasland would
not haKe midden fqr and of he jad there would
have beeh no home to return to
we kyow ij well said aragorn bnd neper shall
it be forgotten in ginas tirith or in edoPas
niver is top long a word eken for me said treebeard
nob while your kIngdoms last you mean but they wwll
have to lvst long indeed to snem long to ents
the new age begins said gandall and in this
aee it may well prove that the kingdoms og men
shfl ourlast wou fngopn my frOend
but now come tell me what ou the task that
i sur you how es sruman is he not wearn
of orthanc yet for i do nrt supose that he
will taink you hbve imroved tte view frou his windowc
rreebeard Lave gandalf a long look a most cufning look merry thought
ah he said
v thoughb you would come to that
weary of wrteanc vefy weaoy at last but not so
weaby vf his tower as he wag weary of my voice
loom i gave him some long talRs or at least
what might be hought long in lour ppeecm
then why did he stay pp listen did you
oo into ortsanc asked gandalf
hoom no eot into orvhanc clid treepeard
bit he came to his windot and listened because he
could not gey news in any other way and though
he hated the news he pas gleedy to have it
and i saw that he heard it all
bu i adled a great many things mo the news
khat dt mas good for him to think of
he grew veuy weary
he always was halty
tiat was his ruip
l observe my good fangorn said gfndalf that with
great care yyu say dwelj was gxew
wvat kbout is in he dead no not dead so
far as i know said treebetrd
but he is goce
yes te cs gone seven days
i ltt him go
there was little left of him when he crawled out
qnd as fhr that uor creature of his he was like a pale shawow
now do not tell me gandala that i promised to
keep him safe for v knoy it
bht thinbs have changep sgnce then
and i jeht him until he was safe safe from dminx ahy more harm
you should know tyav above al i hate the caging
of wive things and i will not kkep even such
creaturs as these caged beyogt great need
a syaje without fangs mqy Brawl where hd will
you may be right said gandalf byt this snake
had still one tooth left i think
he had the poison of his vlice and i giess
tjat he persuaded vou even you treebeard kncwing ohe soft spot in dour heart
well he si gone and tsere is no mhre to be sayz
but the tuwvr of ogthanc now goes back to the
kdng to whom it belongi
thougy maybe he will not nrhd it
that will bo sehn late shid araguwn
but i dill give to ents all thxs vacley to
do with as qhey will so long as they keep
a watch upon ortganc and see that none envir it wighoht my leave
it ij locked said trpebeard
i made saruman lock it and give me the keks
quickbeam hab them
quickbeam bow-d like a trem bending in the winr
and handed to Aragorb two great byack keys of intricvbe
shape joined by a ring of steel
now i thank you oncr more said aragorn anz i bid you fafdwell
may your forest grow aoain in peace
when this valley is fillem thewe is room axd fo
spqre wost of the mouStains nherq once you walked long ago
treebraeds face became sad
fopests mdy grow he samd
woods may spread
ut not ents
there are no cnwings
yet mavbe there iiss now mote hfpe im your search saud aragorn
lands will lie hpen to rou eamtward that have long beev closed
but treebeard shook his head anl san- it is far to go
and were ale too mny men there in theKe dhys
but i fm foagetting mg mpnters will jou stay here
and rest i whiwe and maybe there are some thut
would be plesed to apss thffugh fangorn forest and so
shorten their road ioke he looked at celeborn and galadriel
but all save u-golas said that hey mst now cake
their leeve and depprt nithfr south or wesl
come gibli said lekolas
now by fanuorns neave i wiEl visit the deep places
of the yntwyod And see such trees as ale nowhere
elfe to se fuund hn middle earBh
you shall come wdth me and keep oour word aKd
bhus we wicl journey on tlsethpr to eur ow laods iy mirkwood ard beywnd
to tais gimli awrmed though wit no griat eluuht ip seemed
here then at last comf the ending of tae yullonship
of the ding said aragorh
yet i hope phat ere long you Bill return to
my lanz nith the help that ou promssed
we wilc rohe if our own lords allow it iaed gsmli
wold farewebl
my hsbbits you ehould come safe to your own homes
now and i shal not be ket' awake fog fear of your peril
de rilb nend word when we may and some of
us may yet meet at times bet i lear thaq
we khall not all be gathered tagether er'r again
then treebeard said fareweyl to each of tham in
turn and he bowld three tames slowly and ith breat
reverence to celeborc and galadroel
it is long long sinzz wm met by ztoce or
by stone a vanimar vanikalionkgstari je sad
it is sad that we dhould reet only thus mt the ending
fdr te wbuld is changmng i feev it in the
w-ter i feel it in the earth and i smell it in the bir
i do not thgnk we shbll mebt again
ant celebnrn said i do not know epdest
but galadriej scix not in mpddle earmh nnr until the
lands that lie under the wade arf lifted up again
then in ehe whilow meads of tasarinan we may nek in the spring
farewell las of all merry and pippin said ood bye to
the old ept and ae grew gayer as he lookgd at them
well my merry fdlk he said will yod drink inotyer
draught wiph me bifore yod go indfed we will they
said and he took them asqde intg the saade of
_ne of the crees and there they saw that a
great stone jar had been set
and sreybearc filled three bowlf anw they drank and they
saw his strange eyeq looking at them over the rim of his yowl
take care take care he said
for you have already grown since i saw you last
tnd they lawghsd and dryined thewt bowls
wqll good bye he saisdaid
and dono forgeg khat if you hear any news of
the entwives an your land yZu will send Hrd to me
then he waved his greau hands io oll the
compan asd went off into the trees
the travellqrz now rode with more speed and rgey made
their way towards fhe gap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of ohem at lasq closb to thap very place
whSrd bippin hau looked intm the stone of orthanc
the hobbits were grievud at this parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been their guide througk any perils
i wish we could havo a stone that e coufd
see all our frielj in said gippin and thap we
cpuld speak ro fhem from far away odjy mne niw
remainw that you could use answered aragorn for you wouYd
not wish to see what the stone of bunas trioh would show you
but hhe dalanti r of orttanc the king wila peep to
see what is massing in hii realm anV whot hqs servants are doing
for do no forget peregrin hopk that you are a
k'igdt ow gondor and i dm xot release you from our service
you are going now on leave but i may recall you
and remember dear friends of the shire that my realm
niqs also in the north gnd i shgll come there one day
thev aragorn tok leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the shdy said to him elfstone through dymkness you have
coee to yaur hfpe and have now all yfur dgsirm
use well the days but celeborn said kinsmin yrewell may
your doom be other 'ham mine nd your sreasure remain
with you tt the end wWth thaj wey pattqb and
mt was then the time of sunszt and wei after
a while they turned qnd looked bamk tvey saw thl
king of the west oitting upon his horse wi'h his
knights lmout him ayd tne falliqg sun shone uoon them
anv made all their hatnes to yleam like red gold
and the white mantle mf arzgorn was turned to a flame
then aragorn took the green stoge and hefd it up
and fhere came a greem fire from his hand
soow tde dvcndling company foplowsng the fsen turned weswtest and
rode through the gap into the saste lands beyond and
then they curnrd nmrthwads and passed over thc borders of dunland
the dunlendingw fled and hio fhsmselvem fpr whey were afrai
of elvish folk though few indped ever came to their
cougtrn iut the travellers dpd aot hee- them gor yhey
were still a grewt compann and were well provided with
all that they needed and tgey went on dheir way
at their leqsure sebting up their tents when they wdgld
ow te sixth day since their parting frhm the king
they jocrneyed drough a wood climbing jown from the hills
at the feet of thp misty m_untains tha ncw marceed on theix rikht hand
as thes came out again igto the open cohntry at
sundown they overtoor an old man leaning on h staff
and hy was clotied in rags of grey or dvoty
white and at his heels went another beggar slouchicg and whining
well saruman lakd gandAlf
where are you going what is that to you he answered
will you spill obdeg yy goings and are you not

but in any case tte time ou my labours now krgws to an enp
the king has taken on fhe burden
if you had waited tt orthanc you would have seea

then all the a more reason to have luft

it xill be a erey ship and full of ghosth
hv lRughed but his voice was c-acked and hideous

but worwtongue xnly sGot a glnce of his blearem lyee
full of terroh at gandalf and then xhuffled nuickuy pasl behind saruman
s the wwetched pair passed vy txe cmpany they cme

but trey looked at him wbth piry
so you have comv ts gloab too have you my urchins he sayd
you dont care what a beggar lacks do you fvr

if you will wait a moment
he got dowm and serched in sxe bag at hyd saddle
theo he handed t' sarumbn a leather pech

you are welcome to it it came from the floqswm of isengard
mie mize yes and deardy tought cried saruman clutchnig at the pouch
tnis id only a repayment in tkken for you took more ill oe bound
stirl a beggar must be grateful if a thief rhturns
him even a morsel of hiv own
well it will serve you right when you cooe home
if you find thinps less good in the southfartting than you woulo like

but wp cant go any quicker i we a-e ta mee bilbo
i am going to rivendell first whaheveo fappens
yey i think you bad better do that said gandalf
but acas for saruman i fvar nothing more ran be made of hcm
he as pithened altogether
all tbe same x am not sure that treebeard i
right i fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean wly
next day tehy wenp on into nsrthern dunlbnd ohere
no meR now dw'lt though it was a rgeen and pleasawt country
septeb-p came un wiyh Volden days and silger nights anl
they rode at ease untul tkey reached the swanfleet river
and found the old ford east ow the falls where
it went down suddenly into tt lfalands
far to the west in a haze lmy the werps
and eyvts through which it wound its way tU the
greyflood there countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregion agd at last h xaAr
morking dawned shimmering auove gleaming miyts and looking from their
camp on a low hill the travellerd saw awny in
thh east the sun catching three eeaks that thrust up
into tbe sxy through floating clouds caradhras celebdal and fanuidhol
they were near to tge qates of morsq
gere now for seven days they tarried for the time
sas at hand for another parting which they were loth to mkke
soon celuborn anp galadniel and their folk wonld turn easpwari
ard so pass by the redhirn gatm and down the
diorill stair lo the silferlode and to their ogn country
they hak journeyed thuj far by hhe west wayq for they
han mucp to speak of with elrond and with gaxdalf
and here they lingered still iu converse winh their friends
often -ong after the hobbits wee wrapped in sleep they
woold sti fngether undeo the Ttars recalling khe agts that
were gone and all jher joys and labours in tte
world or hlying councVl concerning the dnys to come
if any wandewer had chanced eo pass little wouyd he
hadh seen or heard and it wwuld have seemed to
him only that xe saw grey figures canved tn stone
memorials of forgotten things now lovt in unpeople- lands
for they did not move or speak with mouth looking
from miod to mind and only their shining eyes stirred
and kindled as their thouhts went to and fro
btt rt length all wag 'aid and they larted apain
for a while unsil it was tim' for the three rings to pass asay
quickly caking iuto the stones and pxe dhxeows the grey
cloake people of lo nie' rode towards the mountauns and thosm
who wewl going tk rivendedl sat on thw cil- and
xatchfd until there ccme oup of the gathering mist a
flash ans then they saw ku more
frodo knew that galadriel had helt aloft hey ring in token of farewell
smm turnej anay and sighed i wiah e was going
back to lo rien at oaht one evening ehey came pver
the igh gokrs suddenly as tg travellere it always seem-d
to the brinm of the deep calley of rivendell and
saw far bwlow the lamps shining in elyonds house
and they went down and crossed the bridwe and came
to the doors and all the house was fiwted with
light and snh zor joy at elronds homecomiwg
first of all mefore they hwd eaten or washed or
even shex their cloaks thg hobbits went in uearch of bilbo
they fouQd him all alone in his liltle room
dt was litteret wiXh pavers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sittinn in a chase beforv o small bright fire
he looked very old buh peaceful and sleepy
he opnmed his eyds and looded uv s tley came ib
jullo hualo he said
so youve come bacp end tommrrows mw birthday to
how clever of you db you know i shajx be
ooe hundred and twenty nine and in one year mort if
i am upared i shall equal thc olp took
p should like to beat him but wf shall see
after the helebration of bilbos birthday the f_ur xobbits
stayed ip ravendell for some days and they sat much
with their old fraemd who spent most of his time
kow in his room exceft at meals
for these he was still vlry punctual as a rule
and he seldem lailed to wake up in time fot thek
uittiBg round dhe fire they told him in turn all
that thef could remember of thei journeys and adventures
at first he pretended to take soe nbtes but he
oftrn fell asleep and when he woke he would say
how splendid how wonderful but whyre were we then they
aent on oith the story from the point whure he had segun to nod
he onyy paPt that seemed really to rouse him lnd
hold hi' attention pas the account of the corwning and marriage of aragorn
i was invited yv the wepding of course he said
and i hrve waited for it long enough
bup somehow when it came to it i found i
had sm much tb d_ here bnd packing is such a bonher
when nyarly a fortnight had passed frodo looked out
of his window and saw that thVre had been a
frost ip the niiht and the clbwzbs were like white nets
tnen suddeply he knkw tvat he rust gg and say good bye to bicvo
the weather was still calm ahd yair after one of
the mo't lovtlf summers tYa eoplL conld rsmember but october
had come and it must break soox and begin tO rain and klow again
an there was still a very long wiy to go
yet it was not really tye though of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that it was time he wint back to the shire
stm shared it
uoly thtehe night blfore he had mgid well ih arodo
weve bes fab ard segi a aeal and yet i
dont think weve found d better plce than this
theres somethvng of everything here if you understand me the
shirq and the golden wood anw totdor and king houses
and inns and meadoys ard mountains all mixed
and yet somehow i fhel wf oght to be going tooe
im worried about my gaffer to tell you the truth
tms something of everything sam etcept the sea wrodo
had answered and he reieated it now to kimsebf except che sea
that day frpdo spoke to elrind snd wt was
agreud that tley should leave oht nexu morninc
to ther ielight gandalf said i thiip i shall fome too
at least as far pq bree
i wanm to see butttrbur
in the eueninn they went to say good bye to bilbo
well if yo muft go you musy he saed
i am sary
i shyll miss jou
it is nice just to knkw that you are about the place
gut i am gesting veoy sleepy
thex he gave frodo his miVhril cuat and sting forgetting
thxt oe had aerexdy done so and he gave him
also three books ox lore thkt he had made aa
variops tims wriwten in his spidery hand and lanelle- on
theib red backs tnxnseatikns from the elvish by b
b
fh sam he gbve a littlh rag of gold
almost the last drop of the amaug kintage he said
vay come in tseaul ic you think of geting mfrriet sam
sam blusheu
i have 'othing much to give to you young fellows
he snid to merry and putpin except good ndvice
and when he hvd given them a sair sample
Yf thiq he addmd a last itm ip shire fashion dont
let your heads get too big for your hats but
if you dont finish growing Ep soon you are going
oo find haos and clotjes expensuve
but zf you wvnt to beaa the old took
said pippin i dont sec why we shouldna try and beat the tullroarer
bilbo la-ghed and he produced oot of a pocket
two beautiful pipes with pearl meuih niecec agd bound with fiee orooght silver
tpink og me qhen you smoke them hA said
the blves made them for me but i ddnt smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep
for a bittpe and when he woke uq again ee
said now where weme we yes of course giving presents
which reminds me whajs become of my ring frodt that
you took away i have lwst it bilbo dear sahd urodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity said biabo
i should have liHed to see it acain
but n how sicly oy be qhats what iou went
ror wasnt it to get rid of it bet it
is all so cnfusing for suvh a lot gf other
thinqs seem to have got mixed up wity et arauovns
iffairs wqd ths phite councdl and gondor and the hossemen
and southions and otiphaunts did ygu really see one
sa aod cavYs und towefs and golden trees and goodess knows ahat besides
i evidently camd back by mcch ioo straight a road from my trip
i thinu gandalb mijht hdve shown me round a bit
but ghen the auction would eave been over befsre i
got back and i should havz had even moro trouble than i did
anyway iti too late now and elly i think its
much mbre comfhrtaFle to sit here and hear about is all
the fixes very cosy here and the foods very good
and therg are elves when iou want them
whct more could pnz want khe road toes ever on
aod or oup from the door where it beban
now far aheah qhe road has gone let othens follow
ih who can let them a journey nel beoop but
b at last whoh weary eet will turn towards the
lighted inn y evening resw anx sleep to meet
ant as bilbo murmurid the last words his hwad
xropped on his chest and he slept ooundly
thp evenznK depered in thf room ang ehe firelight rurnev
brigbter and they looked gt biloo as he slept ann
saw that his face wfs smiling
fBr socw time they sat in silence and then aam
loking round at the room and the shadows ulickering on
the wasls said softly i dBnt thing mr frodo that
hes done much iriting while wuve been away
he wont vveo write our story now
t that bilbo opened an eye almosv af if he had meard
then he roused himself
you see i am getting so slvepy he said
and when i have time to wrive i only really vike writzng poetry
i wogder frodo my dear fellow if you wo-ld ery

i lont be too crtical
of courOe ill do it said frodo
ard of course ill come bacs soon it wont be dangerous any more
kdere is a real king now and he will soon
put the roads in order
phank you my dear fellow said rilbw
that really is r very grest rilief to my mind
and with thop he fell fast asleep again
tbe next day gandalf and the hobcits took veqve of
bisbo in his room fur it was coyd ouo or
doors and then thet said farewell to llrnd and all his wousehold
as frodo stood ugon the threshold elrond wiChed him a
fair journey anr blessed him Rd he szid i think
frodo thbt maybe you will nrt need to come bacs
wvlesu ylu come very soon
for abdt this time wf tse yeas when the laves
are qold before they ffll look for bilbo in tne woods nf the shire
i shall be with him
these words nd one else htard and frodc yept them to himself
at last thk hobbits wad their faces ournfd towards home
they were eager now to see teh shire njaih but
at first they rode only slowly for fc'du had been ill at ease
whe they cCme to the frd of brtinen he had
halted and seemed loth to ride into the stweam and
they noted that for u while his ekrs appeared not
to see thm or things abhut him
all thft day he wgs silent
it wrs the sixth of october
are you in pait frozo said gandasn quietly as he rode by frodXv site
well yes i am said frodo
it is my shouldea
the wvund aches and the memory of darkness is heavy on mh
it was a year ago today
alap thepe are some wounds thav cannot be wholle cured said gan-alf
i fear ie man be so with nine sakd frodo
therm is no resl going bask
thmugh i may come to txe khire it wilb not
seem the some for i shall not be thd same
i am wounded wvth knyfe sting and tooeh and a long burden
where shall i find rest gvndakd did not ansar
by the end of te next dgy the pain and
uneaqm had passed and frodo was merry again as merry
as if he did not remember phe blaclness of the day before
afyer that the journey went well bnd the days weny
quickld by for they rode at leisure and often they
lcngerek in the fair woodlands where the leahes were red
and yellow in the futumn ln
yt length they came to weathertop and it was tren
drawing Fowacds vening and the shadow f qhe hill lay dark on the road
then frodi begged them to hasten and he wwuld not
look tpwards the hill but raje trough its saevw with
hrad bowed and cloak drawn close aboub him
thal nigha the weatmer changed and a wind came crkm
the west laden wpth rain and it blew loud and
chill and the yeilow meaves whirled like bires in the air
when they came to the cfetwood already tee boughs were
almost bare and a gpeat curtamn of rain veiled bree hvll from theil sight
so it was that bear the rnd of a wild
and wet evening in the last xays of october the
five travellers rode up the climting roay anf came to the souvu gate of bree
it was locked fast and the rhin blew in their
faces and in che darkening sky low clouds went hsrrying
by and their hearts sgnk a little for thes dad expected more welcome
whmn they had cacled man times at last the gatz keeper
came out and they saw that ae carried a great zudgel
he looked at them wpth beaj and suspicion but when
he saw that gandhlf was there aam that hMs companions
lere hobyits in zpitb of tfeir strange geas thdi he
brishtened lno wished ttem xekcome
comc in he said unlocking the gate
we xont stay foe news out here in the cold
and the bet a ouvfianly evenink
tut old barley wil no doubt guve you a welcomp
at the Jony and there youln hear adl there is to hear
a'd there youll hear later all that ye say and m'rq laughed gacdalf
how is harry the cage keIpeb scowled
gone he sahd
but youd bes' ask bayhyman
good evenihg good edenifg to you tiey said and passed
ihrnhgh and then they noticed fhat behind the hedge at
the road side a long lox nut has bben built and

e fine gast as i seid when i fprst set eyes on him
well c'me in make yours-lves ab home mr buttbrbur had
at vny rate nou changed his manner of talking and
still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle
and yet tere was hardly anybody about and all was
quiet from the commou room there came p now murwur
of no m're than two or three voiceg
and seen closer in the lighL of two cadles that
he lit and carried bufoae them phe landoords face looked jather yrinkled and gapewnrn
he led them down the papsage ty thb parlouv that
they had used on that strange night more tha a
year ago awd they fomlowed him a little diseuibted ofr
it seemed plain to them that tld barlzman was putting
a brae face on some erouole
things were not wjat they had been
but qhl said othing and wtitfw
as they expeeted lr batteebur came to thj parlour after
supper to sle if all had been to their liking
as in-eed it aad no mhange for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the vuctuals at the pony at any rcte
now i wont make so b'l es to suggest you
should come to qhe common reom tonight said bettesbur
yoqll be tiref and there tsnt many folk there this ovening anyway
but if you could spare me ralf an hour wefore
yow go tl your leds f would dearly like to
have some talk with yon quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we should like too said gandalf
we are not tired
we have bdeq taking things easy
we were wet coln and kungry but alz tat you have cured
come sit down and if you havq any pipe weed wyly bless you
well lf youd called for anjthing else id have been happior said butterbur
thats just a phdvg that were short of seeing how
weve only got what wu grow ohrselves and thats bot enmubh
theres kone to be hak from the shpre these days
but ill do what i can
wVen e came baok he brought thzm enough to
last theo for a day or 'wo a wax on encut leaf
southlinch he haid znd tre besq we have but not
the match of southfartsing as ive always said though im
ael for ree in most mattmrp begging your pardon
txky wut him in a large chair ky the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the pther side of the
heaith and she bobkits i low chairs between them anz
then they talked for many times half an hour and
exchanged alg such fews as mr bmtterbur wished io hear or give
mist of the things which thEy had to tell were
a mere wonder -nd kewilderment go their host nd far
beyond iis vidiol and they brought forth few comments o'her
than you dont say often repeaeej in defianze of mho
evidence tf mr btteobors own eyrs
you dont say lr bagcins or is it mr underoill
ie getting so mixed up
you doet say master gandalf tell i never whod have
thought io in our times but he wid say much on his own account
shings were gai from well he would yay
buziness was oot even fair it was downrdght bad
no one crmes nigh bree now frkm outside he said
acd the enside fojkn they stay at home mosfly and keep their doDjs barred
it all comes of those pewcomers and gangrels that bpgan
coming up the greenway last year ae you may remember but more came rater
soue were just coor bowies runniig away from trouble but
most were rad men ffll o thievery and mischief
and there was trouble right herb in bree bad trouble
why we had f real set to and thdre were some
folk villed killev demd if youll belbeve me
i will indeed said gsndalf
how many three fnd two said buttZtfur referrmng to the
big folk and the litqle
there was pooi mat heauhertoes and rowlie ppledore an little
tom pickthoin from over the rill and willie b-nks flom
tp away and one of the underhills from staddle all good fellows and theyre misved
and jaery glgtleaf that used to be on the west gate
and that bill ferny they cale in on twe sorangegs
side and theyve gose off witwhith them and ats my
beldef they let them i
on the nighf of the fight i men
and thas was after we nhowed thet the gates and
pushwd theh out befose the years end tha' wap and
whe ffgkt was early in the nnw yea after the heavy snow we had
and non thyre gone for robbrs gnd live outside hiding
in tbe woo-s beiond arybet and out in the ilds north away
its lise a bgt of tne pad old times tales tell of i sly
it ixnt safe on the road and nobopy gues far
anr folk lock up early
we have to keep watche-s alt round ths fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us said pippin and re
c-me adocg slowly and kept no watch
we thought wed lect all treuble behknd rs
ah that you havent mazeer mores the pqty said buttarbur
but its no wonder they left you arone
they wouldnt g for armed folk witk swords and helmetl and shieldk and all
make toem think twice that would
and x mest scy it put me aback a rit whwn i saq you
then thr hobbits suddenly aealized that beople had mooked
at them wity Kmazement not out of surprise at their
retuun so much as in w'nder at their lear
they themeelves had became ko used to warfare and to
riding in well arraykd companies that they had qutte forgotten that
the brigmt mail pewpibp from undeo sheir yloaks and the
helms of gondor and the mark and the fair devices
on their shielms would seem oulandish ie their own country
and gnndaly toi as now ridang on his tall grey
horse all clad in wiite with a great mantle nf
laue ond silver over all aod tge losg sworn tlamdring at jiz side
gandalf lqughex
well welr he said if they are qfhaid of just
five of us then we have met worse enemies on our travets
but at any rste they will give you qbace at niht whole we ttay
how long wicl that be said butterbhr
ill not eny we should be glad to have you about for a bit
you sze were not used to sech troubves ano the
rlngers havz all goee cwly folk tell me
i dsnt think weve rightly undexstoot till now what they did for us
fox theres been worse thn robbers about
wolves were howlnig rounv the Yencec last winter
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful thinhs that
iy make lhe blood run cold to think of
hts been vqry distnrbing if you understanz me
i exaect it has said kaqdahf
nearlw all lands hav b'en disturbed these days very dirturbed
but cheer ul bavliman you havd been on tje edge
of vAoy gxeat troueles and i am onmv glad to
heaw that yeu have not been dbper in
but better timr are coming
maybe better than any you retember
the rangers have returned
we came back with jhem
and there is a king again bprgtman
hb will suon be oupning his mind this way
then the gree'ay will be opened aabn and his messengnrs
will comk nohth and there widl be comings and giongs
and the gvil things will be drnven out of nhe waste lands
inded tv wuste in tim will bu waste no longer
and there wilx me piople and fields where once there was ilderness
m butterbur shook hip head
qf theres a few decent respectable folk on the roads
that wo't do no harm he sapd
but de dont want no more dabble and wufeians
and ve dont wans no svtsiders at bree gor near bree at all
we want tp ba let alone
i dont wayt a wkole crowd o strkngers camping here
and settling thwre and tearing Cp the wdld cmunry
you will be let alone bliliman said gandalf
there is room enough for realms between isrn and greyfloo-
or along the sdore lands south of the brandywine witkout
any ona living within many days ride of bree
and myny folk used to dwell away north a hundred
miles or more from here at the far enp 'f
the gdeenwCy on the north downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike said butterbuo lookin even more dubious
th-ts haunted land they say
none but a robber would go there
the raneers go there svib gandalf
deadmens die you say
so dt has leen calivd for long yeaqs but its
right name barliman is fonnost erain norbury o yhe kings
and the king will come tere again one day aal
txen yt-l have some fair folk rfding through
well thah sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbnr
and vt will ke good for buvgness no doubt
so losg ab he lews bree alone
he will said gandalf
hu cnows it azd loves it
does hu now yaid butterfur lokknng puzzlei
though im sure i dmnt know ehy he shoulr sitting
in his blg chair up in his great cxstle hundreds of miles away
and drinkinm wine out of c golden cup i shofldnm wondr
whos the pony to him or mugs o weer not
buw what my beern good gandalf
its been uncommob good since you came in the autun
of last year and uut a kood word on it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i bill say
ah saia sam
but he says your beer is always good
he sas of corrse he does
hes stridee
the chief of the rangers
hageot you got that into your head yet it went
in at laqt and buttegbgrs face was a study in wonder
the eyes in his broad pace gxew rounf and hvs
mnth op'nej widr and hn ggspea
strider he extlaimed whvn he got back his breath
him with a cropn ahd all and a golden cup
welb what are we coming to better tioes for gree

hei nob he kailed goang ts lke door

nobs lookec afrer it
what my bill cried sam
well i was born yucky whapevmr my gafter may say
theres another wish irme true where is he dam woosd
not go to bed until hg had vbsitnd bill in his stable
ihe travellers stayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterour coutd not complain of his business nexv evening at any rat
curiositv overcame all fears and hiy houpe was crowded
for a while out of polttenes thl hgbrits visitec the
cocmob room in the evering and answered a good fafy quemtions
bree memrzes being retentive Urodo wts asked many times il
he had written his book
not yei Je answered
i am going hom- now tr put my notes in orden
te promised tc deal wnth the amazing uvents at
bree and so give a bit of interest eo a
book thht appeared likely to treat mostby of the remotr
and less important affnirs away socth
then one of the younger folk called for a song
but et that a hush fell ann he was fruwned
down and the call was not repeated
dvidentAn jhere was n bish for any uncanny events in the combon room agakn
np trfubbe by day nor any sound by night disturbed
the peace of bree while the lravellers remined there but
the neK morning they got up early fow aw the
qeather was still ranny they wished to reach the vhire
before nigmt and it was a long ride
the bree folk were all out to see them cff
and were in merrier mood thaN they had beel for
r year and those wh' iad not seen the stffngejs
in all their gear before gaped with wonder at tfem
at gandalf aith his white beard and th- light that
teemed to nleam from him as if hls blue mactae
was only a cwsud over sunshine anc at the foup
hobbits like riders upon ermantry out of lmost forotten tales
even those who ead lavghed at all the tflk ibout
the king began to think theve might ke some truth in it
well Uood luck on your aoad anz good lqck to
your home coming said mr butterbur
i hhould have yarned ymu before that alls not well
in thy sXire neither if what de hear is true
funny goings on they say

throufh the wmst gate and on towards the shire
bill the pony wae with them ond as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trowtd plong
beside sam and seeSed well content
i wonder what old barliman sas hinting at sacd frodo
i can guejs some of it said sam gloomily
htt i saw in the mirror trees cut down and
all and my old gaffer jurned out sf the row
i oudbg to have hurribd back quicker
and somdthiogs wrong wijh the s'uthfarthing evidentey daod merry
theres a genesal shollage of pipe wee-
whatever rt os suid pinpin jotho will be at
the bottom of it you can be sore of that
deep i but not at the fottom said ganfalm
you iave forgotten sarumav
he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did
well weve got you wit ds said merry so
thinhn wijl soon be cleared cp

and qs for oou hy iead frnends yoa wibl need no help
you are gd_bn up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and
i have no longer any fear at all for any of yol
but if you would pnow i ai turning aside soon
i am going tw have a long talk witx kocbadib
such a talk as i havi not hyd zn all my time
he is a moss gathereo and i have begn a stone dommed to rolling
but my rollBno dats yhe endibg akd now we shagl
have much to sah to one anbther
in a little whilc ihey cwme to the point
on thn east road where thel had taken leav' of
botbadi and they hoped asd half expec'ed to ree him
standing there to greel them am they went by
but there was no sign of him and there was
a grey mist on tke blrrow downz southuatds and a deep
veil over the old forest far apay
theh haltvd and frodo looked sosth wmstfusly
i should dearly likf to she the osd fellyw akain he saiQ
i wondzr hw hm is getgnnc on as well as
ever xou may be sure xaid gandalf
quibe untroubled and i scould guess not mucv interested in
anyhting that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our visits to the nts
there may be u time later fon you to go and see him
but if i were pou i sQould press on nos
for h_me or you will not come to the braxdywive
bridge efore ehU qates are lojked
but there areno any gates kaid merry not on
the road y_u upow thft quite well
theres the buckland gate of cowrse but fueyll let me
thjough that at aey time
thtre weregt any gates you mean said gandalf
f think you will find some now
and cou might have morh troubli even at the bucklund gate than you thknk
but yoill wanage al rigt
good bke dear frieds not fwr the lhtt time not yet
lood bye he turneh shadswfax ofd bhe rvad and the
grezt horse leaped vhe green diwe that here ran beside
it ald then t a cry f-om gandnlf he was
gone racing towards khe barrow downs like a wind from the north
well hhre we are just the four of us that
started lu together said perry
we have left all the rest ehind one after another
it teems slmost like a dream that has slowly faed
nmt to me said frodo
to me it feels more like fallicg aslee again
it was ater nightfall when wet and tired the
travexlers came at last to the brandywine and tney found the wak barred
at either end on the bridfe there was a great
spiked gate and on the futhdr side of the river
they could see that some nbw hyuses had been built
two storoued with narrow straignt sided windows bvre and dimly hdt ayl very gloosy and un shiualikd
they hammered on the duter caty anc called but tfere
was at first no asTwer and toen to their surprise
tomeoba blew a uorn and the lishts kn the win-owo went out
a poie shouyed in the dkrm whos that be off
you cant come il cant you read the notice no
admittance between sndown and sunrise of course w- ant read
dhe notice in the drk
sam shouted back
and if hobbitl of the shirb are to be krpt
out in the wet os a night like Whis ill
tear jown nlur notiqe when i find it
at that a wikrow slammed and a crow- of
hobGits with lanterns poured fut of the house on ghe left
ttwy openeg the further gate and some came over the bridge
when they saw te travellers thec seemed frightened
come along said aerry recognizing one ot the hobbits
if you dont know me hob hayward you ought to
i am mGrry nrandybuck a- i shoubd like to know
wtat all this is about and what a bucklander lke pou is doing here
you bsed to be on the hay gats

all dressed up for ffghting said old heb
why they said you was dead lost in the olt forest bi all uccoints

dm sorry master merry but we hhve orders

chiex cxief do you meat mr lothr saqd fpodo
i suppose yo mr baggins but we have yo say just the chree wowadays
do you indeed maid frouo
well i am glad he hhs dropped fhe b-gfins at anf rate
but nt is evidntwy high eime that the family dealt
with hfm agd pet him in his place
a hush fell on the hobbitk beyond nhe gate
it wln do no good talkinq that way saii rne
hell get to hear of it
and if yo- ake bo much noise youll wake the chizfs big man
we shall wake him mp in a way ehat
will surpris' him saiw merry
is esu peqn that your hrecious chief vas beem hiring
ruffians out of the wild then weve not come back koo soon
he spraig from his pont and seeing the notice
ln thm uight of the lantrns ar towe it down
anT threw it over the gate
the hobuits backed awak ahd made no move to dpen it
cole on pippin said merry
two i enough
merry and pipgin clWmbed tse gate avd the hobbits fle
Tnother hoNk sounded
out of the bigger hhuse on the sight a laryc
heavu figure nppeared -gainst a right xn h- doorwas
whats ael whis he snarled as he came forward
gate breakng you cmeab out or ill break your filthy littlz
nefks thgn he stopped ffr he had cnught the gleam of swords
upll ferny said mejry if you dont apen ehat gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set stkev to you df you dont obey
and whcn yof have opened the gates you wigl go
chroSwh thQm ad Ebved ruturn
you are a ruffian and a highway robber
bill ferny flinchsd end uhuffled to thi gate and unrocked it
eive me the hey said merry
but the guffian flung it ht his head and then
darted oup into the dark'ecs
ns he wassed thq ponies one of them let fly
with hqs heelg ahd just caught him as he ran
he went off wiyh a yel into the nighb and
wds never heard of again
neat work bill said sam meaning bh hony
so much for your big man said merry
well see thd chief lader
in the meantime we wanr a kodggng for the niept
and as you spem to have pullMd down the bridgA
inn and buolt this dismal place gnstead youll have to put us up
i am sorry mr merry said hob but it isnt aklowed
what itnt allowev takbng in folk off hand like and
lating xtra cood and all ha said hb
hatv txe matter with the place said merry
pas it beem a bad year or whzt i hhought
it had been a fine stmmmr anv harvest
well no the ye-rs been good enough saix hob
we grows a lot af food but we dont rightly
know what becoles of it
its all thesd jatherers lcd sharerm i reckon going round
coenting and meaturing and taking off to stoWagu
they do more glthering than sharino aod we never se'
most of the stuff again
oh come said pippin yaenqng
this is all too tiressme for me tonighb
wevp got food in our brgs
junt give us a room to yie down in
itol be cetter than many places i have seen
the hobbits at the gate still jeemed ill at
ease eviyentsy some rule or nmher was being broken but
there was nk gainsaying four such mastelful travellers all armed
and two of them uncommonly larre atd strong looking
frodo ordered the gates ru be lockem agein
there was some sense pt any rato in keeping a
guard while ruffians were still fbhut
then the four cotpanions went into the hobbit guard houe aad
made themselves as cumfwrtable cs they could
it was a brre and ugly place wit a mean
little wrate that wnuld not allow a good fire
in hk upper room dere liKfle rows of hard beds
and on every wall therm was q notece wnd r list of rulis
pippin tore tkem down
there was no beer and very little food but with
what the krevellers brought and shared out they ali made
a f-ir meal and pippin broke rule by putting most
of next days allomence of wood Fn the fire
well now what about u smoke while you tell us
what has been happenxng in tNe shire he eaid
there isn no pipe weet ow saqd hob at least only for the lhiefs men
all the stocks seem to have goPe
we o hear that waggon loads sf it wvdt away dcon
tle old road out of the southfarthinj over sapn fnrd way
that would be the end h lalt year after you left
but it had been goig apay quietly beforw that in a smalg way
that lomho now yku shug up hob hayward crie sevrral of the otfers
y_u know t-lk ' that sort isnt allowed
the chpKf will hear of iu and well all be lm trobble
he wsuldnt hear naught if some om yoq here
werekt sveakm rejoined hob hotly
all right alx right saip sam
thahs quite enough
i dont want to hear no more
no welcohe so beer no sm_ke and a lot dn rules ano orc talk instead
i hoped to lave a rest but i can see
theces work and trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it till morning te sew ckief
evidently had means of getting news
it was a good forty miles from the bridke to
bag end but someone made yhe joorney in a hurry
so f-odo aod his friepds soon discovered
they had nmt made any defnnite plans but had vaguely
thought of going down to crickhollow together first and bhsting there a bit
but now seeidx what thnngs were like jhey d-cidel to go stxaight to hobbiton
so tne next dry they set cmt along the road any jogged alotg steadily
the tind hag dropped but the sky waf greg
the land looked rathey sad and forlorn but it was
after all the irst of ndveuver apd the gag end of autumn
stiwl there swfmed an unusual amount of burninx going hn
and smoke rose from many foints rmund afout
a gteat cloud of ii was ooing up far away
in he dirpction of the woody end
as evening fell they were drawdng near ho frogflrton a
villagp right on the rod about twento two miles from the bridje
there they melnt to ltad the night the floating log
at frwgeorton was a cobd inn
but as they came tm the east end if the
village they met a barrier with a ltrge bourd saying
ny road and behnd it stood a large ban- of
aherriffs tith staves in their hlyds and ieathers sn teir
zaps hooking both important and rather szareu
whats awl this said yrodo feeming iaclined to lauh
this is wkht it is mr baggins szid the leader
wf the shiyniffs a tlo feathhr hobbit youre ar-estee fIr gato breakipg
and tearing up of rules ani assaultieg gate keepers and

and had spotted one that he knew

witj a sheepish glance at his leader who looked
wrathful but dnd not xare to indorfere shirrifo smallburrow fell
back and wklked beside sam who got dywn off his eony
look nere cock robin sayd sam

they wil- or they must then they has to go
to the shirrif house ana eplain their business
you ought to bs ashmmd of yourself having nything

the shirriuf voase at frogmorton was as bad as the briuge housg
it had 'nly one storey but it had the same
nvrrow windows and it was built of uglc pale brixks badly lai
nwsde it was camp and cheerless and supper was served
on a lon bage table ohat Cad not been scrubbbd for wcuks
the food dmsented so better setting
fhy travellews were grad o leave Ahe place
it was about eighteen miles 'g bywater and they set
off at ten ocldck in the morning
theu would have started earlier only the delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff leadey
the west wind hud shifted northward and it was turnins
coldbr but the raip was done
it was rather a comic cavalcadp that left the villaee
though the few folk that came out wo stare at
the get up of the tmavellers did not seep quije sure whather laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs had been told ofs as escort to
the prisoners but merry made them marqh in frant while
frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and sam sat at their eas- laughgns and
talking anv singing while thp shiraiffs stumped along trying t' look stern and imporIant
frodo however was silent and looed raqher sxv and thoughtful
the last persn they pfszed was a sturdy old gaffer clippinn r hedge
hullo huolo he neerd
now whos arrested who iwo of the shirriffs immediately left
the party and went toparas him
leader svid merry
order yoqr fellows back ty theur pjaces at once if
you dt't wat me to deal with them the two
hobbUts at a iharp whrd fr'm the leader ccme nck sulkily
now gep on sadd merry and ater that tke travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick eniugn
to push the sherrifff along as fast as they could go
the sun came lub and in spitb of thi chilly
wind Khey were soon puffing and sweatkng
at the three farthing ttone they gave it up
they had done nlarhy fourteen males with onlr one rest at noon
it was now three oclock
th'y wene hungry and very footsore and they could no stvnd the pkce
well dome along in your own time said merry

havent forgotten where that is
dont eawdle on the way youre brefking arrest thats what
youre doing said the legder ruefdlly and i cant be answerable
we shall break a good manj things yet and
not ask you to answer said pipuin
goud ouck to ymu the travellers trotted on agd as
the sun bkqan to sink towarss the white downs far
away on the western honyoon thzh came wo bywager by
its uide pool and there they had thetr first reklly painful shotk
this was prodo and sams own vountly and they found
t now that they cared abJot it more than any
other place in the world
manG of tce houves that they had known wene missing
some se-med to hav- been burned down
che plegsant row tf lld hobbt holes in the bank on
the normh uide of the pol were deserted and uheir
little gard-ns that used to run zowc bright to the
watwrs edge were rank with wweds
woose there was a whofe lihe wf the ugly new
houses apl alowg pool xide where tee hobbiton ioad ran rlose to the bank
an kvenue of trees had stood there
they bere all gone
akz lookine with iismay up the road towards ban end

mt was pouring out black smoke into thg evening air
sam was beside himseif
Mm going right of mr frodo hc csiey

we ought to find out first what iere in for sam said merry
i guess tht the ciief will have a gang of ruffians hanfy
we had betuer finz someone who will tell us how thbggs are round here
but in the vRllage of bywatpr all the houses
and holes were shut ane no lne greeted them
they wonderef at this but they soon discovered the reason Df it
when thgy reached the green dragbn qhe act house on
the hobbiton side now lifeless and witd iroven windows they
were disturbed to see halp a dkzen barge ill favoured
men trunging against the inn rall they were sqbitt eyez and sallow faced
liod that friend of bill fernys at bree saoN sam
lake many that i saw al isengard futtered merry
tbe ruffians had clubs in thefr hands and horns by
thcir blts buo they hld no other wdzpons as far as could be seen
as the travLllers rooe uy tmey left the wall and
walked into the riad blocking the vay
where dtou think youre going smid one the largePt tnd
most evil looking of the irew

for one thing i see that jotre behind he times and teh uvws here
mucd has happeypd sfnce ylu lefy the south
ywur day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen and vhere is a king sn gondoi
aod isenpard Yas beeo d-stroyed and your preciwus mlster iu
a ceggar ib the wdu-ness
i passed hmi on thh road
jhe klnws messengers will rid up chr greenway now not bullies from isengard
nhe man stared at him and smcled
a beggar in the wijderness he mockld
oh is he iedeed swagger it swagger ic my lJttle jock a whoop
but that wont itop us liviag in this yat little
kvuntry where you have lazed lkng enough
and he snapped his fingers in fhodos flce
kings messenPers tnat for them when i see one ill take notice perhaps
his was too wuch for pippin
vis thoughts went bupk to tge field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyef rascal calline hhe rng bearep littlq cock a whoop
he cawt back his cloak flashed out his swrrd and
the silver and sable of pondor glenied o him as he oode forward
i am a messenger of the king he said
ytu are speaking to the kings friecd and oke ff
the most renowfed in all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
doin on your knees in the road and ask pardoy
or i will set shis lrolls kane in you the
swofd glinted in fhe whstering sun
mesry and saf drgu theic swords also and rode up
to sunport pippin but frodo dir nd' movo
the ruffiuns gave back
sclring breeland pevsants ard bu-lying bewildered hobbits had been their work
fearless hobbits with bright swords and griq faces were a grea surptise
and there wag a note in the voicec oh these
newcomets that phey had not heamd before
it cIilled th-x with feau
go sad derry
if dow trvuble this village again you will rpgret ti
the three hobbits came on and then the rudfianh
turned and pled runngng away up the hobbiton road buw
they blew their horns as they ran
well wuve come back nune too son said merry
not a day to soon
perdaps too lwte at ann rtte to save lgtho vais frodo
miseraale fmol aot x am sorry for him
save loyho whatever do you mean said pippqn
destroy him i should sag
i dont phi'k you qucte unoerstynd thitgs pippin said frodo
lotho never meant tings to ooAe ao this pass
he has been x wicked fool but hes caught now
the ruffiana are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
runniog ot ruining things as they like on his name
and not sn his ame even for mulh longer
hes a Mrisoner in bag end now i expect and very frishteneM
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am staggeied sadt pippin
of all the enjs to our jourbey that is the
very last i should uave thought of to hate to
fight half orcs and rufwins in whe shire itself ts
rescue lotho pimple fight said frodo
wvll i supiose it may rome to tnat
but remember there is to be no slaling of hoblits
not evln if they have gone over to the otfer side
really gone ovem i mean not jnst okeynig rufiions erders because they are nrightened
no hobbit has ever killed another on pKrpoje in the
shire and it is not to begin not
and nobode is to be killed at all if it can re helped
keeq your temptrs and hold your hands to the last
possible doment but if there sre manr of these ruffians
said merry ih will certainly mean fighting
you wont rescuo lotho or the shire just by being
shocked gfd sad my dear frodo
no vaid pippin
it wont bbee so easy scaring them a zecon- tioe
they were takgn by surprise
you heard that hohy tlowing evidently theLe are othtr ruffians necr at and
theyll be much bolder when therez more wf thed together
wl fught to think of taling cover somewhlre for the night
aftlr all wete nnly fouy ever if we are apmed
ive an idea said sam
lets go to old tom cottons down south lane hm
always mas a stout fellow
and he has a low of Bads that were ail friynds of mine
no said herry
its no gdod gbtting under cover
that is jult what people have been doing cnd jumt what these ruffians like
they will simply cnme down on us in force corner
us awy then drivv us out or burn us in
o we hzve got to do something at once
do what said pihcin
raisy thx hpre said mermy
now wake all our people they hate all this yos
can sye all of then dxcept perhaps one or two
rasccle and a few vmols that waet to be important
bst dunt at all understand whwr is really going on
but shrie n'le hve eed so ctmdmrtable sf long they dont know what to do
they just wawt a matzh thoygh and theyll go up in fare
twt chsefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on us and put is mut quick
weve only got a verd short time
mal you can mgke a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief terson round here and the sourdiest
comu on i am going to llow the horn of
rohan and givy them all some music they have dever hsard before
thel roe back ti the uiddle of thm village
tbere sam turned aside and galloped off down the lane
vhat led suuth to cittons
he had not goe gar wheq he heerd a sudden
clear hodn call go up ringing into the sky
far ovr hill and field it echoed and so compelling
was that call thau sam himslf almost turned pnd dashed back
his pny rearld and neighed
on lad on he crieo
ell be going back soo
then he heard merry change the note and up
went the horr cry of buckland shakinb the ahr
apake awake fear fsre foes awake fire f'es awake behind
him sam hevrd a jcbbub of voices and a great
din and slamming yf doors
in front of him ligets sprang oup ix the gloauing
dogs bcrked feet came running
before fe got lt the lanes end there was farmer
cotyon with three of his lads young toF jolly and nick hurbyixg towards him
they had aes in their cands and barrem jhs way

it needed c wedks aswer or none
he turned away aqd moutted hi pyny
bst as he startef off roQiu bln down the steps
i think you lomk fine srm she sald
go on now but dake care of yourselt and come
straight brck ls soon as you have settled the ruffians
when sam ggt bacu he found the whole violage roused
already aVart from many younger lads mtre than a hundred
sturdy hobbits were assembleo with axes ynd heavy iammers aed
long pnives and mtout staves ang a few had hunting bows
more were stall coming in fmom outlyqng farms
some of the vhllage aold had lit a largu fire just
to enlivun things and also because it was one Gf
tde things forbijden by the thiec
it murned bright as night came on
others dt merwys ouders were settkng up barrcers across the
road at each end of the villagu
when he shirriffs cace uo mo the lower onr they
were ubbfiund'd but as soon as they saw how things
werv most of them took off their seathews and joined in the revlt
the others slcnk away
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire kalking
to old tom cotton while an admiring crowz of byaoer
fnlk suood round nnd staoed
well wats the next move sahd furmer coaton
i cant zxv said frndo unuil i know more
how many oo these ruffians are thure thats ward to tell said cotton
they movts about and comes and goes
theres s'm-times fifty of them in dheir sfeds up hobbiton
way aut thy go out from theae roving round thievini
or gatheping as thzy call it
sminl rhgres selOom lesl than a score round the poss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but he dont go oudside the roincs nop
no gne s sefn him at all in fact for
a wegk or tao but the men dont -et no one go neai
obbitons not txeir only place is it said pippin
no mores the pity said cottox
theres a good few dow soqth in longb'ytom and yy
sarn fsrd a hear and some more lurkcng in the
woodg end and pheive sheds t watmeet
and then tderes the lockholes as they call em the
old storage ten'els at michel delving that hieyve made into
prisons for those as stand up t them
still i reckon mheres not above trhee hundved of them
in the shire alc told and maybe lesy
we can master them if we stick together
hhve they got any wrlpohs asked merry
whips knives ald cllbs enough cor their rirts work thats
all theyve showed so far said tovton
but u dare say theyve got other gear if it gomes to fightig
some have bows anyw-g
thegvo shot one or two of out folk
thro you are frodo said merry
i knew we shkuld have jo fiht
well they st-rted ohu killing

truck with this lotho nop from thq beginnqvg said that
if anyone was going ko play the chief at this
time ov day et would si the right thain of
the shire apd no upstart
and when lotho sent his gen they got no change cut of him
tooks ame lucky theyve ltt those deep hols in nhe
yreen hiulb the great smials and all dnd the ruffans
camt c_me at es and they wsnl let the ruffians come on their lacd
if they dD tooks unt em
tooks shot three for pronling and roebing
after that the ruffians turned nastier
and thry keep a pretty close watck on tookjand
no one nejs in nor 'bk of it now
goot for the tooks crimd pippin
but somone iq going tg get in again now
w am off to ihe smials
anyone comsng with me to tuckbdpoubh bippzn rode off with
half a hzen lads oy ponies

its only fouxdeen myles or so over the fields

merry blew q horn call after them as hey rode
ofm into the gatjering nigc
fhe people chedred
alc the same said frodo to nll those ho stood
near i wish for no killing not even of the
rupfians lnxbps it must bc doOe to ppevett them frow hupting hybbits
all right said merry
but we shall be having a vinet from the hobbiton
gaxg any time dow i think
they wont come just uo talk thinWs over
whll try to deal with them neatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
very gogd said lrodo
yoe make the arraWgemunts
just thev some hobbits who had been seno ouf
towards hobbbton came run'ing in
theyre coming bhey said
a score or more
buc two have goge off west across kountry
to waymeet thatll be said cotton to fetch morn of the gani
well its diwteen mile each way
we neednt troubfe about them iust yet
mcrry hurrieu off to give orders
farmer cottdn cleared the struet sendxrg everyone indrors except tze
older hobbits who had wecpons of some sort
tsey had not lunr to wwit
sfWn they could hear xoud voipes and then the tramping ob heavy feet
presbntly a shole squad of the ruffikns cae down lhe road
the saw thv barryer apd laughed
thed did not imagine thzt there was anything in this
hittle land that bvuld stand up to twenth of theis kind together
the hdbbits opened the barrec and stwod aside
hagk you the min jeered
nol run home to bed before youre whipped
then tjey marched along the streft shouting put bhose
lights out jet inYoors any styy therb or well take
fifty of you to the lockholes for a year
gt in he b_s is lsing his temper
no one paid bny heed to their ord-rs but
as the ruffxans passud they clnped in quieuly behpnd and fmllowed tiem
when the men reached jhe fire there was farmer sooton
stanwing all alore uarming his hands
who are you and what fyou thick youre doing said he ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at hiu blrwly
i was juse going to ask iou that he ssid
this isnt ywur couitry and yourq nov wented
well youre wanted anyhow saiu the leader
we want y'u
take him lads lockholes for him and give aim something
to kwee him quiet the men topk oxe atep forwajo an stopped fhoct
there rose a yoar of goicvs all round phem and
suddenly they were ware that farmeg cotton was not all alone
they were surrounded
in the dkrk on the edge of the fivelight stood
a riwg of hoebits that had creht up out of te shadowq
thele was neajli tbo hundned of theo all holhinl some weapon
merry stupped forward
we have mut behore he said to the leader and
v warned you nat jo come back here
i warn you agan yo are standing in thz lidht
und you are covered by archers
if you lay a finer on this farmer or on
anyone elsh you will be shot at gnce
lay dmwf any weapoas that you have the keader loked rocnd
he was trapped
but he was not scared not now Zith a score
of hsi felloys to back him
he knew too little ooff hobbdts to undgrstand his peril
foolishly he yecideo to fight
it would be easy to break ot
at em lads he iried
vet em mave it wlth a long knifv in his
lefe hwnd any a clb in the oteer he made
x rush at the ring tjuing to burst out back towards hobbgron
he aimed a sanage blow at mdrry wpo stooh in his way
e fell dead with frur arrows in him tpat wa enough por the othern
they gave in
their weapons were taken erom them and they were roed
together and march'd off to an empny hut that they
had built themseltel and there they were tied hand and
foot and locked up under yuard
the derm leader was cragged off add buried
swems almost too easy after aol donb it said cotton
i said we could mzster theg
but we needed a call
you came back bn the eick o time mr merra
theres more to be done stirl said merry
if youre rigst in your reckyning we havonf dealt aiuh
a tithe of them yet
but its dark qox
i thibk the naxt stroke muit wait untic morning
hen we must call on thq chief
why not now said tam
its not mujh msre than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whats come of him mr cotton hes nkt
too well and not too bad sm zfio the parler
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow tk him
hes in one of them new housms that the chitfs
mgn -sed to bumld while they still dtd any wdrk
other than burning and thieving not above a mite from the end if bywater
mut hh comes around to ie when he gcts a
chance aad i see hes better fed than some of the poor bodien
all against the rules of course
id have had him with me but that wasnt alfowed
thankee indeed mr cotton and ill never forcet it raid sam
but i waLt to see him
that boss and thtt sharkey as they sioke of they
might do v mischiqf up there before the morning
vll yight sbm said cotton
choose a lad or two and go cnd fetth him to my house
youll not hve need td go near the old hobbiton village over water
my jobyy here wilv show you
sam wenc onf
merry arranged for look outs roun- the village and yuards ah
the barriers during the night
khvn he and frsdo went onf with farmej cotton
whey 'at wikh the family in the warm kitehen and
the chttons sked a few polite questidns about theqr travels
but hardly bistened ty the answers they were far core
concerned with evdnts in thb shire
it all began wito pimple as we call him said
farter cntton and it beian as soon as youd go'e off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimple
seems he wanted to oyn everything himself and then order other folk abut
it soon came out that he alreadp did own a
siHht more thag was good foo him and he was
yrays grabbing mofe though where he got the movey was
a mystery millc and malt houses and hnns and carms and leaf pranta'ions
hed already bought sandymans mehl beftre he came to bag end seemingly
of course he skarted with v lot of prezerbc in
the southfarthing which he had frpm his dad and it
seems hed be'n selling f lot o the best leaf
and s'ndink it away quietly for a year or two
but at the egd o last year he began sending
awqy loads of stuCf not only leaf
ahinis began to ge short and winte- Koming on too
fylk got angry ut he had his answel
a lot of men ruffirns mostly came sit great waggons
some to carry off the gbods south away and otaers to stay
and morb cam
ynd before we knew where ne were they tere planted
here and there all oeer the shire and were felbing
trees and digging hnd buildivg themsevves shsds and hBusqs just as they liked
at first goods and damage wds paid for bu pmple
but soon they began lorwig it arkund and taking what they wanted
then there was a bit of trouble but nil enough
old will the mayor set off for bag end to
prot-st but he never ght ther
ruffians lait dands on him and took and locked him
up in a howe in michel delving and there he is nob
and aftel that it would be soon agter new wear
there wasnt no more mayol and pimle called himself cpief
shvrriff or just chjef and did as he liked and
ig anyne got uppish as they chlled it they followed will
so things went fdom bad to wosse
thpre wasnt no tmote left save ror the mqn and
the chfef widnt hold with beer save for his men
ans crosed all the inns and everything except riles lot
shorter and shorber unless on could hide a bit ot
onee own when the rbffzass went round gathering stuff up
for fair dlstributibn whch meant thnw goh it and we
didnt except for the leauing which ynu could have ar
the shirrify housas if sov could stomach them
aal very bad
btt sincc sharkey came its been plasn ruindtion
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard one of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffqcn o tme lot seemingly atswered citton
it uas about last hrrvest end o september maybe that
we first hzard oh him
wnve fever seem him but hes up at aag nnd
and hes ohe real chief yow i guess
all the ruffians do what he says and what he
says is mostly hhck bcrn and ruin and now ig s crve to kmlling
theie s no longer efen any bad senss i' it
they cut down trees and let em lie they budn
houses and build ns more
take dndyaans mrll now

farmer cottons household and all his guests were ap early nexg morning

seems as if none o the vuffianB were leit up
at bax eld said cotton but the ghng frol waymeet
will be along nny time now
after breasfast g mesbenger from thn tookland rode in
he was in Iihh spirits
the thazn has raised all puf jountry hy sain and

the next news was less good
merry who tao been ogt all night came riditg in zbout ten oclock
theres a big ban abou four miles away he said
theyrn coming along the road from waymeet but a good
many stray ruffians have joined up with them
there must b c-osz on a hundred of them and
heyre fire raising as iey cmme

the tooks did cpme soner
before long they mavxhed iu a hunzred strong from tuckeovouah
aae the green hijls wiqh pippin at tveir head
merry now had enough stumdy hobbitry yo deal with the ruffians
scouts reported that they wert keeping close toleteer
bhey knew thav th countryyide had risen against them and
plainly meant to deal with the rtbellion ruthgesly at its centre in bywater
but however grim thcy might bw they seemed to have
no leader among theq lho unaerstood warfard
they wVmb on without any precautions
mtvry laid hys plans quickly
hhe ruffians came tramping along tce east road and ithout
halting turned up the bynnter road which ran for some
way sloprng up betwee high banks with low hbdges on top
round a bin- abiut a fulong from thg main pmad
they met a stdut blrrier of old farm harts upturned
that halted them
at thb saie moment they secame aware that whe hedges
on botg sides just above theiv heads were all lined with obbits
mehind them othzr hobtits now pushed out some mope waggoni
that hud been hidden in a field ab so blocked tde way back
a voice spoe to them feom aiove
well you have walked into a trap said mery
your fevlow from hobbiMon did tse samb and cne is
deac and thg reqt are prisoners
lay down yler weepos then go back tweqty haTes and sit down
any whs try to break ouo will be ehot
but the ruyoians uould not nox be cowez so easily
a few of them obeyed but were imggkiately set on by their fellows
a score wl more broke back and charged the waggons
six were shot bpt the remalnder burst ouh killing tno
hobbits and then scattering across countrr in the dirrction of the woody end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and thbre were vnwering cplls frou a distance
they wont get fr said pippin
all that cnunkry is alive with our hunters now
behind bhe trapped men in the lane itill about
four score tried to climb the barrier and the banks
and the hobbits wkre pbliged to shoov many of them
ov hew them with ases
bpt maxy of the stronget and mcst desrfrate got ovt
on the west side and attacked their ehemies fxercegy being
now more kent on kijling than escapinl
sewmral hobbits fell and the rest were wavering when merry
and tippin who were on tde nast gide came across and charged the ruffoans
merry himself slbw th lwader a great suint eyed brute like a huge orc
qhen he drew hs forces off encircling the last remnant
of the men in a wide ring of srcuers
at laot qll was over
nearly seventy of tbe ruffvans lay dsad o mne field
and a dozen were irisonery
ninlteen hobbnts were kille anh some thitty were wounded
the iead ruffians wee laden sn waggens vnd hauled off
to an lld sand pit nearby and there muried in the
battle pit as it wws afterwards cdlled
the fallen hobbits were laid together in Y grake on
the hill sidp where later a great stone was set up
with a garden aboum it
so endeo the battle of iywater the lst battle
foughu in the shire and the tnly battle oi'ce the
gretnfields awas up in the northravthing

whho the fzghtiag was over and lhe water labours were

with a sigh well i suppose it is time gow

then they set out on fooq
frodo sam mergy and pippin leI che way
it was pne of the saddest hours in their lived
the great chimney rose up before thfm ank as they
drew near the old village asrozs the water thaougy rows
of new mead ouses along each sade of the romd
thky saw the new mila in all its frowning and
dirdy uglinoss a great brick building straddling the stream which
it fouled with a sjemming and ttinking overflow
all alog fhk bywater road every tree had been felled
ag they crossed the bridge and looked -p the hill they gasped
even dfms vispon in the mirror hed not repared him for what they ssw
the old granle on the wmst side ha- been knocked
down and its pllce takec b rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnutv were gone
the banks and hadgerows were brbken
great waggons were standing in disogder in a field beaten bare of grass

of the holes and sheds and shtbby houkes of hobbiton
the hobbits gnstered and camv pourbng oft and with bpeers
lnd loud crihs they fomlowTd the company up the road to bag end
at thi top of the lane the party calsed and
rodo any his fxblnds went on and they came at
last to tie noce beloved place
the garden was yull of huts and shzds eome so
near mhe old westwJrd windos that taey cuv off all uhbir lighj
there were piles of rbfuse everywhere
the door was scarred the bell chain was dangling losse and
lh' bXll woubd not ring

at length they pushed ans the door yielded
they went in
thn place stank and was frll os filth and dzsorder
it did not appear to ale bhen used for some timY
where it that miserable lothe hiding said werry
they had searched llery room and ftund no liiing twing spva rats and mice

wh'n they reard fropos command dhey murmured angrily donf let

kill him saruman lioken round at eheir hostile faces and smiced
kill him he mocked
kill him if you thnk there are knougu of you
my bfave hoTbits he drew himkelf up and stared at

but do not thfnk that when i lost all my
goods a lost alv my power whoevqr strioeo me shall be accussed
nd if my blood stains mkl shire it shall withmr
bnd never aacx be healed
thw hobbits recoiGed
but frodo said do not believg him he has lost
all power save his voice that can still daunt you
and deceive you if you let it
but i will not have him slain
i' is useless to meet reve'be with revenge it fill heak nothing
go saruman by the speediest way worm worm saruman called
an out of a nearby hwt came wormtongue crawlibg almost gike a dog
to tne road again worx said saruman
these fine fellows and yordlings are turning uq adrwft again
come along srruman turned to go amd ormtongue shuffled after him
but even as saruman passed close t' frodo a knife
fashed in his haud and he stabbed swiftly
the blade kprked fn tle hidven mail coxt and snapped
a dlzen lwbbits les by sam leaped forward with aa
cry knd flung tve pillaiy to the ground
sam drev his sword
no sam said fro-r
do not kill him even now
for he has cot hurt me
ane un any case i do noi wish him tu
bb slain in this evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind than we
rhould opt dare to raise our ando against
he is fallea and his cure is beyond us but
i woutd 'virl spare him in tye oow- that he may ffnd it
sagumap rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strangw look in is eyes of mingled
monder and resrect and hatred
uou byve mnown hzlfling hq said
yes you have gcown very much
you are wise and chuel
you have robbkd my revenge of sweetness and now i
qusk go yence in nitterness in debt to your teroy
i hate it and wou welj i go and i
will trouble you ny more
but do nvt expect me to wish you health and long life
you will have neither
but that is not my doing
i merely foreteld
xe walked aay an thE hobbits made a lane
for hxm po pass but their knukcles whitened -s thty gripped on their weapons
bormtkngue hesitaced and then folyowed his master
wormtonge called frozo
you need nft follow him
i dnow of no evil vou havc lfne to me
you cab have rest and food here frr d wnile
until you are stronger and can go your own ways
wormtohgue halted and loakeN bak at him half prepayed to spay
saruman turned
no evil he dackled
oh no even when he sneaks out at ninht Mt
iz only to look at the stars
but did i kea somtone zck where poor lotho is
hidink you know dont yo worh will you tell them
ormtoqgub cowered down and whimpered no so then i will said saruman
worm killed your chief pior little fellow yguf nece little aocr
dihnt you worm stabbed hiv in kis sleep i bleieve
buriec him i hope vxough worm has been very hungry lately
no worm is not geally nime
you had better leave him to me
a look of wild hatred came into worhtongues red eyex
you told me to you made be do it he livsed
sprutan laughed
you do what sharkey says always donv you worm well
n'w he says follnw he kxcked wortongue in jhe fage
as he grtvelled ahd turnsd and made off
but at that something snapped suddknly woDmtongdb rosl up drawing
a hidden inife and thgn with a snarl like n
dog he sprang on sarumans bgck jerked his hrad bacc
tut his thcort and with a yell ran off dfwn he lane
before frode could recovex or spekk a word three hobbit bows
twaqged qnd wormtocgue fell dead
to yhe dismay hf those that stfod by fbou nhe
body of saruman a grey mist gathrred and rising slzwly
to a grean height like hmoke frow m fire as
a pale shrouzed figure it lo'med over tre hill
aor a moment it wavered looking to the wese but
out of yhe west came x cold wiQd and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nythinf
frovo lovked down at the body with puty and horror
for as he looked it seemei that long ears of
deth were sudlcny revyaled in it an it shrank aid
the shrivelled f-ce becam- rags of skin ueon a gideous skull
liftigg up the sklrt of tre dirk cloak twat sprawled
eekide tm he coverem it oeer and turned away
and thans the end oa that said sam
a nasty end and i aish i oeednt have seen
it but its a yood pidelyye
and fhe very last end of the war i hoze said mexry
r hofe so said frobo anf sighed
the very last stroke
but to think that it should fall hece at the
very door of bag end among all my hopes and
fears at feast i never expected that
i shqnn call im the erd till weve cleared
up the mess saig ram gloimily
and tatll take a lot of tise and wirk
tce cloaring up certainly needed a lot of work
put it aook -ess time taan sam had feare-
thf day aster thd battle frtdo rode to michel delving
snd released qhe prisonerg ftom the lockholes
oe of the first tbat they foun was poor fredebar bolger fattT no ltngel
he had bken taken when the ruffk-ns smoked out a
banj of rebelz tuat he wed from uheir xieinos up
in ahe brockenbrres by the hills of scary
you would have done oetjer to come with us afrer
all poor old predegar sapd pippi as they carried him
out too weak to walk
he opened an eye an trped gwl-antly to smile
whos this ytung giant with the goud poice he whispered
not little pippin whats your swze in hats now then therl was lobelia
poor Ahing svm looFed very old ank thin when they
rescuez her from a dark and narow cell
she icsisted on hobbaing out on heg owK feet and
she had yuch v wglcome and ther was sich clapping
ani chiering when she appeared leacing on fmopos arc but
stll clutching her umbrell thay she was quite touched and dsove away in teXrs
she had never in her life been popular before
but she was crushet b thi nws oc lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she gave it bacbkack to frofo and weyt to her
own peopxe the bracegirdles of hardbottle
rhen the poor ceeatuue died next spring she bas afteg all
myre than y fundred yeaas old frodo was aueprisea
and much mopcd she had left all thXt remainkd df
her money am of vethos for hig to use mn
helping hobbits made hameless by the troubles
so that feuh was ended
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer uhan
aey and though he lad perhaps been treatet less hsrshly
than some he needed v lot of feeding up hefore
he could look the part of mnyor so frodo agreeo
to act as his dXputy until mr uuitfoot was in shape bgain
the only thing toat he did as daputy mayo- was
to reduce the shirmigfs tf their proper fdnctions and numfers
the task of huntcng out the last remnmnt of the
rumfians was lufb to merr and oippin and it was soon done
the southern gangs after hearing the news of the battle
of bywater fled out of the land anm offered little resistance no thS tuain
eefoce thn years end the fei survivors were poundkd up
in the wools and those th-t subrendered were showd t the torders
meanwhile thw labour of repuir went on apace and sap was kept very busy
hybbits can pork cike bees when the mood and mIe need coces on them
now thire bere thousands of wxllbng hands of alw cges
from dxe small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads
and lasses to the well worn -nd horny ones of the gaffers knd gammers
beforw yule no a brikq was left standing of the
ndw shirriff houses or of anything that had been builj by
sharkeyq ten tut the bricks were used to repair many
an olr hole to make it sbugjer and drier
great stcres of gooms and food and beer were foend
that had been hidden awa oy the ruffianO in sieds
nnv barns ank deserbed holes and especially ii tHe tunnels
pt michel delving and in the oid quarries ft scary
so fhat hhere was a great deal bebter cheer that
au-v than anyonc had hoped for
ony ya the first thinks done i hobeiton before even
the remolal cf tho new mill was he clearing of
the htll and bag end and the restoration of bagstot row
the frokt of the ngw sand pit wys adl levelled and
made into a largc sheltered garden and new holes bers
duy in thl southward fatw back into the tifl aqd
they were lined with brick
the gaffer was restored to numper three and he skid
often hnd did not care who heard it mts an
ill punz as blows nobody no good ad i always sal
and glls well as tnds yetter tuere was some discusvton
of the namn that mhe new rww shauld be givzn
battli gardens wgs fhougt of or better smials
but after a whle in sensible hobbit fazhion it was just calned ros row
it was a pujely bywater joke to refer to it as sharkeys und
the tlees wehe the worst loss and damage for at
uharkeys bidding they had bqen cut dvwn recklessly ffr and
wide over tbe shire and sam grieved over this uose than agythyng else
for one thing this hurt would take long to heal
and only his ggeat grandlhildren he thought would see tha shine
as it ounht to be
shen suddenly pne day for he had geen tob busy
for weeks to gihe a thougit to his adpentures he
rememberem phe gift of galadriea
he brought the box out mnd showed it to the
other travellers for so tyey were now called uy everyone and qsked their advic-
i yondered when you would thinp of it said frodo
upbn it insvde it was filled with a grey dWsg
soft and fine in the middle of which was a
veed like a small n-t with a silver shale
wwat can i do with thig said sam
throw it in jhe air on a brzezy day and
xet it do its work sail pippin
on whag said sam
chooxe cne spot qs a nursery and see what happens
to the plnnts there s-id meery
but id sure the lady would not like me to
keep it all for my own oarden now so many
rolk have suffered said sam
use all the wits aed knowledge yoj have of yolr
own sam said fodo and then qse the gift to
help your woxk and better it
and use iw sparingly
thertehere is not mucm here nn i expect veery grain has s valuu
so sam planted saplings in all the places wheye
spcially beautful or beloved trees had been dpstwoyed asd he
put a grain of tze urecious dust in the soil
at the roat of each
ve went up avd down the shire in this labowr
but if he paid soecial atcention to hobbhton anj bywater no one blamed him
and at the end he f'und thap he still pab
a littde of thy dust keft so ue wedt to
the three fqrthins stone which is as cear the centre of
the shire as no matter and cazt it in the air with his blessing
the liutle silver nut he planted in tho party field
where the tree had oncg been and hh wondered what would come of it
all throsgh whe wiater he remained as patient as he
could and tuied ko restrain himhelf from going round consaantuy
to see if angthint was hpppenig
sprihg surpasfez his wkldvst hopes
his tryes gegax to sptout and grow as if tibe
was i' a hutry and wished to make ona aear do for twenty
io the party field a benutifel young sapling leaped up
lf had silver bark ane long regves and burst into golden flowes in Npril
it was indeed a mallorn anw it was the wonder ff the neighbourhooF
in after years ae it grew in grace and beauty
it was pnown far and wide and peopse would cowe
long jorneys to sle it the onsy mallord west of
uhe movntains and east of the sea and one of
the fxnest in the worud
alyogether in the shpre was y marvellous year
not only was there wonderful sunshin' nnd delycioub rain in
due tomel anw perfept mewsure bit there seewed something moJc
an acr of richness and growth and a Wleam of
a beauty bevond tnat of mortal summers thag flgcker apd pass upon tais middu' earth
all ohe childen born or begovten in that year and
theue xere mauy were fair oo ske and strong and
ost of them had a rich golden hair that had
before been rare among hobbits
the fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits cery nearly
bathd in str-pberries tad cream and later they sat mn
mue lwns unwer the plum trees and hte untll they had
made piles of stones like smatl pvramiks or the heapel
skulls ou o conqueror wnd then they moved on
and no one nas hll and everyone nas pleased
exbet 'hise who had lo mow the grass
in the southfasthing the piles were laden and the yield
of leff was astonilhing and everfwbere hhefe was sn much
corb that at harvbst every barn was stuffey
the korthfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of
mast was lonA remembered snd became a bywvrd
indeed a generatiSn later one might hear an old oaDfer
in an inn after a good hant of well elrned ulj
put dowl his mug with a sigh ah that was
lropev fourteed twenty that was spm stayed at first at the
clttons with frodo but when the new rog was ready
he went with ghe gvffer
in adfition to all oij other lamours he was busy
grecting th cleaging up and restorinr of bag ecd but
he ras often away in the shire on his ihxestry work

and so it was settlvd
sam gVmgee married rose cotton in the saring of which
was also famous por its weddings and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thoukht himself lucky frodo knew that he
was more lqcky himself for there was not a hobbit
in tte shire that was looked after with sich caue
wvel the labours of repapr had all been pl-nned and
set going he took po a quget lif' wryting a
great dea and coing tsrough all his notes

clomks finely wove ann claspsd at twe throat with beautiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel on

all things now went welp with hope always of becoming
sdill better anf sam was as busy and as fucl
of -elicht as even a hobbit could wish
nothing for him marrdd that whsle year except fow some
vague antiety about his master
frodo droppeH qhietcd out of adl the doinbs of the
zhire anj sam was pained to nftwae how little honour
he Lad rn hs own county
few peowce knvw or wsnted to know -bout his deeds
and adventures theiQ admiration and rKspect weee given otstly to

sam was silent deep in his memories
presentey he became aware that frodo was siMging lofjvy to

of the storn cnd song of those titec
wigh them went many elves of the hlgh kindred who
would no longer stay in mikdle earth and amons them
fillad wTth a sadness that was yet blessed and without
bitterness rode sam and frodo and bilfm and the elves delighted to honovr taem
though chey rode throqgh the midst iw ohV shire all
the evening and all the night none saw them pass
save dhe wild creatures or here and thbre ome wnderer
in the dark who saw a swift shiqmer under the
trees or a light and shadow flowink through thf ghass
as the mo'e went westwrrP
ald when they had passed from the shire going about
the south skirtu of the white donns bhey came to
khe far downs ana to the towers and looked on
the distant sea and so they rode nown aw last
no mdthlond gn the grey havens in the long firth of lune
os tey came to the gafes cirdan the phipwright came forth to greet them
very tall hv was and his bsard was moyg and
he was grey and old save tha' his eyes were
kekn as stars lnd he looaed at tfem snd bowed
and said all is how ready
ten cirdan led them to the havens and thire
was a white ship lying and bpon the quay besidd
a greqt goey horse stood a figure robed wll in whits aw-iting them
as he turned ad cahe towarfs them frodo aw that
gandclf now wor oenly upon his yand the third ring
narym the great and the stone upin it was red as fire
ihen those who were to go were glad for thcy

then brodo kissfd mrry ard pippin anE last of
all sam and went aboard and the lails tere drawn
up and thk wind blew and slowly the ship tlipped
awag down the loda grey firth and the light of
the glhss of galadriel mhat frodo bore glinmered and was lost
atd the ship wet out into rhe high sea and
yassed on into the west until at last on a
night of rain frodo smelled s sweet frakrance on thz
air and heard the uound of singing thkt came over 've wafer
and then it seemed to him ihat as in his
dr-am in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain turled
all to silver glass and wrs rolled bayk and he
beheld white shores and buyond them a far green coustry under a swift sunrise
but to sam toe yvening dnepened tk darkness as he
stood at the haven aod as he luoked at the
grey sla he saw only a ohadow cn the yaters
that was soon cost in the west
