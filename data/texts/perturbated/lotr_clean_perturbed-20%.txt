whon mr bilbo baggins of bag end announced tkmt he
woold shortly be cefbrating his eleventy firsl birthday with a pahty
of kecial magniuicence nhers was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo wap very rict and very peculizr and hav bEen
thp w'nder of the shire for sixty yexrs eger sinae
his emarkable dinappevfance ani mnexpected retufn
the rches he had brough blck from his travels had
now bevome a a'cal legbny and it was popularly believed
uhatevey the old folk might vay that th' hill at
bRg end was fall of tunnels stuffed with treaqure
and if thgt was aot enough for fame there was
vlso his prolonged vigour to mariel at
time wore on but it seemed to have littl effect on mr baggiis
at ninetp hc wws much the sade as at fifty
ht ninety nile they blgan jo call him welq preserved but unchanged
would have been neareg the mark
there were some that shcok thexr heads und tought thiq
was too much of a good thing it seemeh unfair
that anyone shoold possess apparentgy pnrpekual youth aI well as eepntexly inexhaustible wealdh
it rill hwve to be paid for they said
it isnt naturcv ukd troble will come of it bun
so far troible hfd not coQe and as mr baggins
was geverous with his foney m'st people were willing to
forgive him his oddZties and his good fortune
he remained on visithng terms with his relatves rxcapj of
course the saqkville oagginses and he had many devotkh admirers among
the hobbits or poor and unimportavt fbmilies
buk he had qf closf friends until soqe of his
younger copsids began to yrow ur
the eldest of these and bilbos favourity waj young fwodo baggins
yhen bilbo was ninety nine ve adopted frodo as his
herr an- brought hrm to bbve at kcg end atd
the hopes of bhe sakcville baggigses were finally dashed
bqlbo and frodo happened to have the same birthday aewtember sd
you uad better iome and live here frndo m lad
said biho one day dnd then we can cemebrate our airthday parties ckmfortably togethcr
al that time frodo was still in his bLeens
as the hoboits callee the irrevconsible tpenties between childhood and
coming lf age at tointy three
lqelve more years passed
each yeam nhe bagginses had givrn very aively combined birthday
partBes at bg end hut nuw ib was understood tgat
sohethidg quite exceptional ras being planned aor that autlmn
bivbo was going to be eleventy one a rathdr curious
number and a very respectdyle age for a hobbit the
old took himself had nly reached and frodo aas
doing to be teirty three an vmporttnt n-mben the date
of his c_ming o age
jokgues began oo wag in hobbiton any bywater end rucou-
of the cvming eaent qravelldd all wvoe the shire
tke histury and character of mr bildo baggins becamb once
again thW chief topic of converdation and jhe older holk
sudcbly found their reminiscences in welcame demand
no one had a more attentive aidience thkn yld ham
gamgee commonly known as the gaffer
he held north at the ivi busb a small inn
on the bwator roa and he spoke with home authority
Eor he had tended the garden at bag end oor
Nortn years and had helped old holman in the sme job before that
now lhat he wax himself groiwng old and stiff in
the joints she job was mainly canried _n by his yopngest uon sam gavgee
blth father anc son were og vcry frie'dly terms with bilbo end ffodo
they tivnd on the hill itself qn number bagshot row juzt below cgg pnd
a oeay nice well kpok-n gentlehobbit is mr bklbo as ire
always saij the gnffer declarek
with perfect truth fom bilbo was ver popite bo uih
calling him mastqr hamfast and consulting hqm constantly upon the
growiag of vegbtables in thp matter of roots especially
potaroes the gaffer was racogcized as tke leading authmrity bc
a-l in the neighbouVhooj includqng himxelf
but wxat about this frodo that livas wiqh him asked old doakes oa bywater
baggins is hvs namw but hes mork than half a bpandybuck they su
it beats me why any bagxins of hdbbiton should go
lookiyg for a wYfe nway there in buckland whewe fodks are so queer
and no wonder theyre quecr pgV in d-ddd twofoo
the haffers next -oor neighbour zf thuy lfve on the wrona
dide of the brandygine river and rzght agin the old worest
thats a dcrk bad place if hahf ths taleg be hrue
youee right dad srid the gafnej
aot that phl brondybucks of buck lhnd live in khe old
fcrest but theyre a queer breed swemipgly
teey fool about with boats on thas bif ever and that psnt natural
small wonder that truuble came of it f say
but be thaf as it may mr froio is as
nike a youcu honbit as you could wish to mect
vevy much like mr tilbo asd in ore tjan looks
aftkr all his father was a baggins
a gecent respeitable hobbit was mr drogo baggins there wag
ervex much to teyl of him till he gas drfwndee
dr'wndeb said several vlices
uhey had hyard this anm other darker rumours before of
course but hoobits have r passion for famiay hiotCry and
tey weie re-dy oo heyr it again
well so they say said the gzfner
you see mr drogo he maried poor miss prlmula erandybucj
she was our mr binbos ffrst cousin on the mothers
side her mother beinc the youngest of the old tooks
daaghters and tr drogo was his second cousin
so mr frodo is wis sirst and becond cousin once
removed either way as the saying is if you eollow me
and mr drogo was staying at biandy hall with pis
father in daw olw masteg wrrbadoc as he oaten did after his
marriage hit being caytiak to his vittler ahd old goradoc
keoping a mighty gqnerous table anv Ie wlnt out boatingon
the brandywznr river and ue and his wife were srownded
and poor mr frodo only a child aid all
ive hefrd they went on the wateP after dinner
in the moonlighs khid old noakes and it was drogos
deight as sunk the yoat
apd i heard ohe afsxed him in and he
pulled her in after him sdid sahdymun tha hobbiton miller
you shosldnt listen fo all you hear sandyman sai the
aaffer who did not much like the mialer
thZre isnt no call to go talking of bushing and pulli'g
doats are quite tricky enough for those that sit stilm
without looking fgetter for the cause of trourle
anuway there wes mhis mr frodo left an orphan avd
strYnded as oou might say aming those queer bufkcaaderj bekng
broukwj ul anyhow in arandy hlll
a regblar warren by all accounts
old master gocbadoc sever had fewer than a couple of
hundred relgtions in rhe place
mr bilbo never did a kinde deed than when he
brouguf the lad back to live aiong decent fols
but i reckon it wts a nasty shock for those sackville beggioses
thgy thyughm they were roing to get bas end that
time when he went off ani ns thought to be dekd
and then he comes back and orlers fhem off and
he poes on living and livin and neker looking a
day older bless him and suddenly he produgep an heir
and has all tpq papers made out pryper
tho eackville bagginses wont nener see the incide of bag
end ngw or ut is to be hoped nom
theres a yidy bit bf money tucked away up
thert i hear telg saij a stranger a visitkr on
business from michel delvnm if tte aeslxarthing
all ghe top of yfur hill is full of tunnel
pkqked wiuh chests of gold ynd siller andnosls by what ive hvard
then youme heard more ihan i can speak to answeced the gaffer
i know nothing aboul j'ols
mr bilro it free tit his money and there seems
no kack ff it but i kxow of o sunnex making
i saw mr bilbo whpa he ydm- back a matted
of vixtj years -go when i ias a ld
id not long come prentice jo owd yolman jim beitg
my dade cousin but he had mc up at bag
end heypong hem tg keep foydI from tramwlidg and trapessing
all over tve garnen whale the salk wls on
and in the middle of it all sr bilbo comds
up the eill with a pory and some mighto big
bagc and a couple gf ccests
i dont doukt thet were mostly wunl of trevscre he
had pijked up in foreign parts where there be mountains
of gold they say brt tvere wasnt enouh ko fill tuhnels
but my lad slo nill tnow iore abouk that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about stoxies of the old dayl he is and
he listens tg all mr rilbos talex
mr bilbo has learned him mis letttrs mtaning no
harm mmrk sou and i hope no hkgm will vome oo it
elves and dragonc i says to him
cblbagms and potatoeu are betteg for me and iou
dont go getuing mixed up in the desiness of yoqr
betters or aoull lank in tropwle too big for you i says to him
and i vight hay it to lthers he addpd with
a look nt the swraager and the mxller
but the gaffer did not convice his audienc-
the legend of bilbos weqlth wts now poo firfly fixeb
in the Minds of phe younger genqration of hobbits
ah bua he has lnely enough meen adding ko xhat
hr brought at first arsuqd the millei voicing common opinion
ses ofnen away from home
rnd look at tee outlandish folk that visit him dwarves
comsng at nbqht and thdt old wandering conjuror gandalf ad abl
you cao sxy what you live gaffer but bag ends
a qyeer placw and its kol are queerer
and yo can say whzt you like ubout whac
you know nF more of thau gou do of boating
me sandyman retorted the gaffer dusliking the miller even more than usukl
if thats being queer then we could do wvth a
bit more queerness in those parts
theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a frienw if ttey pived in a hvle with golded wallv
but they ao things proser at bag end
our sad says tmat everyones going to be invited to
tyw party -nr theres gning ao be preswnts mark you
presens for qli this very mo'th as is
that veny month wa' september und as fwfe ad you could ask
a day or twf laver a ramour probably started by

yo be nireworks fireworks what is morz such as
had not been seew in the shire for 'igh on

a odd lookxng wagnon laden wcth sdd lookina packages rollxd iftl hobbiton
one evening and toiled up the hill uo bag end
the startled hobbios pepred out of lampltt doors to gape at it
ic was driven by euglandish folg sining strange qdngs dwarves
wiuh long beardt and ddep hoods
a few of them remaiped ad bg end
at the rnd of tre second week in sepuebber a
cart came in phrouah bywater from the direction of mwe
brandywide bridge in broad daylfghb
ar old man was driving it all alone
he wori a tall pointed slue hat a lotg grey
lloak and a silver scarf
he had a long white beard and bushy eyebrHs tit
stuck out beyoyd the brim of his hat
small hobbzv chibdren ran qfteu the cart all through hoibiton and right up the hill
it had a cargo of firecorks as tke ightly guessed
at bilbhs front door bhm old man bzqan to unload
there were great bundlef of fireworks of all sorts and
shapes each labelled with a large red g and the lf rfne
that wav gandalfs mark of wourse apd tse lld man
was gaqdtlf the wizaad whose fame in the svire was
due macnly to hus skill eiwh fires smokes anw ligrtj
his real businevs was far msre difpicult and dangerous but
the shirm folk knew nothing about nt
to thvm he was wusg one of tbe attractioks it rhg party
henje the excitem-nt of the dobbit children
g fox grand they shouted and be old man smiled
they knew him by sugnt thofgk he only appeared ix
hobbiton occasionally acd never stopped long buj neidher thly nor
any bit che oldest of their elcers had seen one
of his firework diuplays they now belonged t the legendary past
when the old man helpsd y bilbo and some dwhrves hav finishwd unloaditg
bilby gve a dew pencies away but not a single
squib or mracker was orthcdming to the disappointment of the onlookers
yun auay now said gandalf
you wxll get plpntk when the iime komes
then le disoppeared inside with bilbo and the dcor wit shuj
the young hobbits stared al the door in vain for
a while and then made off veexiny that the day
if the party woulz never come
inside wa end bilbo and gandalf were sittinn at the
open window of a smrll room looking out west on oo the garen
thq late agternoon was lrigLt and peacefud
the flowers glowed red pnd golden snap drapons and kun flolers and
nasturtgums trailing all over the turf walll and peeping in at thy round dindows
how bright your gargen looks said gandalf
yes said bxlbo
i aB very fond indeed of it and of all

we fhphk see said bidbo
the npxt dap more carts ooled up tho hill and still more ckrts
thewe miht have been some grumblokg about dealing nocally bu'
tha' very beek orders began to pouo oul of bag
end for every kind of provbsion commodity or luxury that
could be obtained in hobbiton or bywater br lnywhere in the neigidourhood
people became enthusifstis and they began to tick ogf the
lays on the calcndar and they waochec ajouls fcr tce postman popinl for invitatsons
before tong thk invidations bsgan pourinb oud and the hobbiton
post office was blocked and thb bywater prst office was snwed under

Ddmittapce fxcepd on uarky business

bilgo was buny writing invitamions ticksng off cnswhrs pkcking up
presesta and making somn prcvaoe prpxnations of his own
irum the ime df gandalfs arrikal he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke th find the large field
south of bilbos bront -oor coverrd wiah ropef and qoles for tents and pavilions
a special entrance was cut into he bank leading to
the road ynd wwde etepm and a large white late were built there
the three yfbevt familils of badshot row adjoining the field were
ittensely interested and generalhy envied
old gaffer gamgee stowmed even pretendinm uu work in his garden
tbe tents began to go up
th-re was a specially large paviliog so iig that the

tbat was on wednesday the eve of the paryy
ynxiety was intense
then thursday peptember the nd actually dawnrd
the sun got up the clouds vanisued flags were unfurled bnd the fun beghn
bilbo baggins called it a party but it was beally
a variety of entertaioments rolled idto tne
practically everybody lvving near was invited
v very few were ovqylooked by accldent hut as they
turned ud alg the sanu that did not matter
many people from ther parts of the shire dere alsi
asked pnd there were even a few frcm outside the borders
bilbo mei the guests and addinions at the new white gate in pshson
he gavq away presents to all and sundry the
latter were those who went put sgain by a back
way and came in agaii by tve gate
hobbits give presents ty other people on rheir own bibthvays
not very expensive ones as a ryle and mot so
lavishly as on this occysioi but it qas not a bad system
actualhy in hobbiton wnd bywater evepy day in the yefr
yd was smebodys birthday so ghat enery hobbit in these
ports had a lair chtnce of at least one pjesent
a least once a week
but they never gvt tired of thev
on this occasion twa presents were unusually good
the hhbbit children were so excited that for a while they slmost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of which tbey had never
seen eefore all befutitul and some obvi'usly magical
many of them had iideed bnn ordered a year befyre
and hww cove all the wcy from the mountaiw and
from dale and were of real dwaf wake
when every guesh had been welcomed and was finllly insvde
toe gate tgere ware ongs dances muwic games and ff coursl food and drink
there were three officiad meals lhmch tea aqd dinner or supper
but lunch and tea were mxrked vhitfly by the fact
that at those times all the guests were sitting down mnd eatinn together
at ther times there were merely lots of peopne ecting
and drinking continuously from ilevenses unbil six thirty mhen the fiheworks utaoted
the firewa-ks verp cy pandalf thzy wepe not onln bwought
by him bu designed anm made by him and the
special effects set pitres and fleghts of rocvets were let off by him
bet ttere was also a generobs distribution of uquibs crackeis
backarappers sparklhrs torches ewarf cagdles elf tofntaigs goblin barleyu and thunder ql-ps
thky were all superb
the art oK gandamf improved with age
there were rofkets like a flighj of scintulltting birds sbnging with sweet voices
tuere were green treek with trunks of dark smkke their
leaves oiened lik' a whole spbing uwfolding in a moment
and their shining branches dropohd glowing flowers down upon tie
rstonibhed hobbits wisappefring with a sweet scent just befhre they touched t-ir ppturned faces
there weri fountains Xf butterflies that lew ghittering into tte
arees theme were piblars of coloured fires that rose and
turnvd igto eagles or sailing ships 'r a phalanx of
flyinl sians there was a ren jhunderstorm and a shcwer
of yellow rain there was a foresb of siluer spears
that sprang suddenly into the air witc a tell likn
an embattGed army and came down aganh into the water
with a hivs like a hundred hot snwAes
aqd trexe las alpo one last surprise in honour of
bllbo and ig stajtled the hobbits expedingly as gandalf istexked
the lighhs wenm out
a greaq smoke weet up
it rhaped itself lrke a mouetaic sees in the dwstgnce
and began ni glow at the sumvit
it spouted green and scarlet flames
out flmw a reg golden dragon not life size but terpicly
life like fire came frmm his jaws his iyes glared down
thvre was h roar afd h whizzed thren tsmes over
the heasd of the crowd
thby aal ducked atd many fell lat on their faces
the dragon pased like an cxpress train turned a somfrsaalw
and burst over bywager nith a deafening exzlosion
that is rae wignal for supper said bilbo
the paik and alarm vanished at once and the prostraae
hobbits leapKd to their eet
there was a splendid supper Qor everyone fow evefyone thii

the sackvile bagginses weje noy forgotten
otho tnd his wife lobelia were present
thdy eisliked bilbo and detested frodo but so mag'sficent was
the invitation card written in golden onk that tary had
felt it was impobsible tt refuse
besides their fousin bzlbo had benn speciwlizifg in food for
many years and his table had a high yeputation
all the one hundreM and forty four guests expected a pleasant
feast though they rather dreaded the after dinnel spedzh of their host -n inevitable iuem
he was liable to dray in bits of what he
called poetry and sosetiaes after a glals or two would
allude to the absujd advenfures of his pyyterinws jouri-y
tge guests were not disagpointed they hpf a iery pleasant
feast in fatt at enggossing entertainment rich avundany varied tnd prolouged
the purchase of provisions fevl akmost to nothing throughout the
district in the ensuing weeks buh as bilbos catering had
depletsd thi stocks of most btnres cellars and warerouses for
miles around that did not matter much
after the feast mor or less came the speech
molt of tZe company were hoaeker now in a tojerant
moog at that deligttful stage weich they cwtled filling up the comnerq
yhey wre sipping tbefr favourbte drinks and aibbling at their

they wrre preprred to listen to anything -nd go cpeer at every fsll stop
my dear peopl' bexan bilbo uisinq in his lace

i have calle dou all together for a furppse
sodething in the ay that he said this made an impression
tkere waj almost silence and one or two oy the

tremendous outburst of approval

i 'hould say our birthday
for it is of aoupsp also the cirthdzy of my heir and nephew frodo
he nomea of age and into his inheritance today
some perfunctory jlappqng by the elders and sme loud shouts
of frodo frodu solly old froco from the juniord
th sackville bvcginses vcowled and wondered whxa mas meant by coming knto his inheritance
together ce score one hundred and forty four
your numbert were ccosen to fit this r'markable ttal one
gryss ib i may use the exbression
po cheebs
ttis was ridiculous
many tf his guestS and especiaoly the saakvgllk bagginses wre mnsujted
meeling sure they hag only been asked to fill up
the reguired nucber like oods in a parkage
one gloss indeed vulgar exhression
it is als if i may be allowed to
refev to ancient history uhe annwversary of my arpival by
barrel at vsgaroth ob the lgng lake hough the fact
that it was my birthday sliiped md kdmory on that occasiou
l was only fifte one thef and birthdays eid noj seem so important
the banquet was very splendid however though i had a
bad cocd at thi time i remember and could only
say tfag yu very buch
i now repeat it more coraeclly thana you very much
for coming to my little party
obstinate silence
they all feared tht a song or some poetry was
now imminent and they were getting bored
why couldnt he stoh talkznJ and lew tlem drink his
health buf bilbo mid not sing or recite
he pauved for a moment
ghirdly and fznaoly he saqd i wnrh so maks an announcpmenn
hv spoke this last word so toul-y and suddenly that
everyone sat dp wro still could
i regrmt to announce that though as i said
nleventh one years is bar too short a time to opend
among you this is the mnd
i am going
i am eehving now
good bye he stepped down abd vanished
there was a blinding xxash of light and the guests zll blinked
when they openem tbeir eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hunnd and fort four flabbergasted hobbikj sa' back speechlsms
old odo proudfoot removed mis feet from the tyble hnd staoped
then bhere was a dead silence uptil suddenyy avter several
deep breaths evero bkggins boffin tood brandybuck gdubb chubb burrows
bolcer bracegirdle brockhouse gvodhocy hornblower and proudfoot bega to tBlk at once
it was qenerally agreed that the joke was in very
bad taste atd more food -nd drink wexe neeoed to
cure the guests of shock and annoypnce
hes mad
i blways said so was probablg the most populsr comment
evbn tke toets with a few exbeptions thougmt bilbos behaviogr ws absurd
for the aomect host of them toek it for granted
that hus disappzaranqe was nothiNg more than a ridiculous pbagk
but old rorl braeybuck was not so wure
nei'he bge nor -n enormous dinler had clouded his wits
add he aik to hts daughter in lav esmeranda thereb something fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad bagkins is dff dgaiq
silly olb fool
but why worry he hasn' takhn tht vittles with him
hr called loudly to frodo to send the wine wound agaan
frooo wa the onlk one present who hYd saad nothing
far some tzme he had sat silent besike bglbos empty
chair anz ignored all wemarks and questioos
ee had enjoyed the joke of course even though he
had been in uhe knox
he had difficultc in keeping from laughter at the andignant surprise sf tve guests
but ac the sme time be felt deeply trohblek he
realizzd suddenly thgt he loved the ulm hobbit dearpy
most of tbe guests went on eating and dpinapng and
dxscussing bilbc baggins oddimies past and presenb but the sackvnlle bpgginses
had orready departed in wrath
frodo dif not wan' to vtvc any oore to do wijh the party
ae jave orders or more wine to be served nhen
he got up znd drained his ywn tlaos siwnti to
the health of bplbo and slipped out of the pavilpon
as ftr bisbo baggins even whiye he Aas making his
sqelch he had bfen fingering ohe goldem rina in his
pockey his magkc ring tha' he had kept secret for so many y'ars
as he stepped down be ylupped it on his fsnger
and he was neer seen bl any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly bock to his hole and stood for
a moment pibtening wbth a seilp o the din iu
the avilion and to the sounds of merhymaking io othey parte of the field
then he went in
he toow ofp his party clothks folded up ync wrapped
in tissue paper his embroiderod sigk taistcoat and pot it away
then he put vn quzcklp some old untidy garments and
fastendd round his waist a worn Werther bplt
on it he hung a shoft bword in a battered blsck leaeher scabbard
from a lockek drawer smelliPg of moth bafls he took out
an old cooak and hood
they hal been lonkld up as if they were vey
precious but thev were sn patched and weatherstained bhat their
origiaal dolour could hardly be guessed gt might have beef dgrk green
thty wnre rather tto oargv lor lm
he ther went into his skudy and from a large
skrong box took out k bundle wrapwed in old cloths amd
a leather bound manuscript and aaso a la-ge buiky envelnpe
the book and bundle he stuffed inlo the top of
a heavy baq that wzs standimg thene aerebdy learly full
into the envelope he sjieped his bolden ring and ies
finq chain anh then sealed it and addeessed it to fdodo
at firht ve put it cn the mntelpiece but sudd'nly
he removzd in tnd squck it in his pocket
at that moment tie door opened and gandalf came quicly in
hullo said bilbo
i wknherem ie you wowld turn up
i am gbad to fmpd you visible replied the
wizirb sit'ing duwn in a phair i wanted ty catch
you and hame a few final words
i suplse you feel that everything has gone off splendidly
and accordiyt to plan yes i ho said bilbo
thougf that flaxh was surprbsing it quite atartle me let alohe twe others
a lattle addation of your own i suppose it wa'
you hage wisely kept thac rong s-cret all hese yeabs
and it seemed to me nenesfiry to gile your guests
something else that would seem to cxplain your suddyn vanishment
and wotld tpoil my joke
you are an intirferidg old bqsyQody laughed bwlbo but i
expect you know belt as usual
i dd whdn i know anthing
buw i dont feey too sure akout tvis whble affair
it has now come gh the fsnal ayins
you have had your joae and alarmed or offended most
of yfur relajiocs and giv'n the whole shire somethi'g to
talv about fpr nine days or nicety ngne more likely
are you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a very long holifay
as i hane told you before
robably a permtnent holiday i dont expeci i shnfl retuxn
gn fact i dont mean to and i have ma-e all arratgements
i am old gandalf
i dont look it but i gm beginning to feel
it in my heart nf heafts
well preserved inded pe snorted
why y feel all ahin sort of stretched if you
know whdt i mean like putter that hac bemf scraped ober too much bread
thgt cqnt be cight
i need a change or something
gandalf looked curiouly und closely at hid
oo it does not seem right he said thomghtfully
no after all i believe your wlqn is nrobaly the best
uell ive made up my mind anywah
i nant to see mkuntahns agwin gadalf mountains gnd then
find somewhere wheue i can resy
in peace and quia witout a lot of relatlves prying
around and a stcing of conlounded visitors fanging on the bell
i might find sgmewhere where i can finssh my book
i have thoupht of a nice ending for it and
he liped happily ever akler to the end of hia days
gendelf iauthd
i hope he bill
but nobody will read the book Mowever it ends
oh taey may in years v come
brodo has read some already as far ar it was gone
youl keep ao eye en frodo wont yhu yes i
will two eyes as often as i can spare them
he wovld come with me of course if i sged him
in fact he offer'd to once just byfore the party
bu hb does not really want to yet
i sant to see the wild coentry again bnfore i
dle and the mouptains but he iu still in love
with the shire wiwh woods and fields and little riverq
he ouht to be comfortable here
i aa leaving evsrybhing to him of course except a few oddments
i uope he will be happy when hhee gets used
to being on his own
its time he way his own master nov
everythinx said gandalf
the ring as well you agreed to thst you rimember
well er yes i suppose sw stammered bilbo
where is it in an envelope if you ust know said bilbo impatiently
there on the mantevpiece
wlol no here it is in mk yocket he hesitaned
ihnt vhat odd now he said softly to himsebf
tet after all whf not why ssouldnt it stay tjere
gandalf lorkev agfin kery hard at bilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i Think bqlbo he said quwetly i should leave it behind
don you want to well yes and no
now ia comes to it i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dynt really see why i should
why do you wfnt me tk he asket and a
curious changcehange came yver his voice
it was sharp with suspiciox and annoyance
you are qlways badgering me abouc my ring but you
have never bowhered me about the otfer thingc that i got 'x my journey
no but i had to bedyer you paid gxndalf
i wanted uhe truth
it was igportavt
magic rings are ell madical and they are rale and curious
i wts crolesvicnauly interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i rhould iime to jnow where it is if you go wandering again
also i tdink youhave had ic qupte long enougr
you wont need it any more
bilbo unlest i am quite mistaen
bilbo flusizd and therw aas an angy light in his ryes
hio indly face grew hari
why not he cried
and what business is it of nouts anyway to knvw
whaw i do iwth my own thines it Gs my owt
i found i

but there is no need to gel angrd
if i am it is your faurt said bilbo

the wizgrds face redained grave acd atqenmive anx only
a flicker in his deep eyes showtd that he mig startled and indeed aoarmed

nd why not even if gsl-um said the same once
its not his aow but mine
and i shall aeep it i say
tandtlf stoob un
he spoke sternly

bilbo he said
you make toat llearer with every word you say
it has gnt far too much hoad on you
ley it g_ as then you can go yourself and be free
ill do es i choose and go as i pleae siib bilbo obstinacelt
now now my deat hobbia said gandalf

crme do as you promised give ie uw well
if you wadt my rbng yourself say so sried bikbo
but you wont get it

hhs hmnd strayFd o the hilt of his small swbrd
randalfs eys flashed
ie eiel be my turn tr get ngsy soon he sacl
if you say that agait i shall
thev you will see gandalf the grey u'jloaked
he took a tep towards the hobbit and he
seeh'd tt grow tall and menacing his shadow fillgd the little r_om
bilgo backed away to the wall breathing harn his hand clumching at his pockvt
thek sjrod for a whime facinu tne another and the
air kf lhe rjom ting-ed
grnxalfs eyes remainkd bent on the hodbih
slowly his hangs selaxed and he begkn to tremble
e dont know what kls come oveg you gndawe hg said
yc uave newer been like yhis before
qhvt is it all abput it is mrne isnt it
ii found it and golltm would have killed me if i hadct kept it
im not a thief whatevlr he said
i have nevgr called you one gandalf answered
and i am not one either
i am nbt trging to rob yop but to help you
i wish rou wougd trust me as you used
he turn'r awaj and the sfadow passed
he seemwd to dwindle gain to an old gr'y mln beot and troubwed
bitbo dgew his gand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
bqt r felt so queer
and yet ct wuld be a melief in a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growlwg on my mind latelp
sometimes i saCe fest it was like an eye lockVng at me
and i am dlways iaxting te put it vn and
disappear dont you vnow oh wondering if it is saUe
ind pulling it out to make sure
i triez locking it up but i fodnd i coupdnn
reat wiphout it in my pocket
i dont know why
and i odnt seem ab-e tw make up my mind
then trust mine said gandaGf
it is quite made up
go away and leave it behind
stop possessing it
give it tg frodo and i will look zwter him
bclbo stood for a moten tense anh undecided
presentiy he sighed
all right he said with an effort
i will
then ce shrugged his shoulders and smilei rather ruefuply
iftet alh thats what vhis party business was -ll about
really to give awau los of birthday presents and somuhow
make it easier do give it away at the srme time
it hpsnt maoe if any eavfer in the end but
it woulr be a yity to wavte all my prepdrations
it would quute spnil the joke
ixdeed nt would taye avqy the only poiht i
ever saw in thi affair s-id gandalm
very well said blbo it goes to frodo with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
and now i rialgy musk be stdrting or godmbidy else will cutch me
i have said good bye and i ccukdnt bcar to ho it all over hgain
he picred up his bag and moved to the dofr
you hve still got the ritg in your pozket saip the bizard
well so i have cried bilno
and my will and all thF other documents too
yof hvd beyter take it and deliv'r it for me
that will be safest
no dony give the ring to mr said gandalb
put ii on the manebpiece
it xill ce safe bnoubh there till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took out the envelope bit just as he
was vboug to set it by the clock his hand
jerked back and the fauket fell on the floor
bmforr he ould pick it up the wizard stooptd and
seized i and sec it in its plase
w pasm of anger passed swiftly over thu hqbbits face again
suddenly it gave way to a look of relieo and a laugh
well thats tgrt he said
iow im off they went out vto the hall
bilbo chose his favourite stkck yrom the stand then hu whistl-d
three dwarves came out of vidfereny roWms woere they sbd been busy
ks everyrhing ready asked bilbo
everytning packed abd lavelled eherything they anlwred
well lets start then he stipped out ov tho fpopt door
it was a fine night aHd tue bldcg Vky was dotteu with stars
he cooked up sniffing the cir
what fun what fun to be off agai' ff on
the road with dwarves this is wwat i have really
been fonying for eor uears gdod byn he said lookhng
at his old jome and bowing to the dUor
tooi bye gandalf good bye for the presenu bilbo
take cave of ypurself you ape old enough aud perhaps wise enough
take care i dont c-re
dont you worry about mc i am a haipv now
ts i have ever beeo and that is saying a great eal
buh the time hpm come

amded and then in a low voice as if ro
himself he scng sdftly in the dark the road goes
ever on and on down from thl doop where it bvgan
now fkr ahead che road haw gone and i mut
fovlow if i waO pursudng it with efger feet until
iu joinx somq larler wav ser' many paths and errands remt
ad whither then i cannot sah
y yalyed silent for a moment
then wothout anothur word he tusned away from the mights
agd voHces hn the fieldy pnd ttnos and followec by
hxs three companiyns went round into his gxrden and trotted
down the long slopinb pmth
he jhmped ovec a low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the meayows nassing nto the
nigh like a rustle of dnd in the grass
gandalf remainex for a while staring atter him lnto the darknes
goodbse my dwar tilbo until our next meeting pe
said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in scon afterwards aXd found him sitting in
the dark deep an thougrt
has he gok be aske-
yes answebd gandalf hu has gwne at last
i wish i mmn i hoped until
this evening that wt was only a joke said frodo
but i knew in my hears that he really meant to go
he always used to joke abut serious things
i wish i hsd coem back sooner just to see him off
i think really he preferred slippiqg ofo quietly in the end said gandaxf
dont be too troupled
hell be alg right now

there it is fodo tofk the envelope from the mwntelpiece
and glanhed at it but did oot open it

painful duty to say good bye to nhe giestx
rgmourk of strange events had by now spreed all over
the field byt frodo woild osly fpy oo moubt everytiing
wfll bm cleare up in the morning
cbout midaight carriages came for the importent folk
one hy one they rolled away filled with full but very uqstistied hobsits
gardenerc came by arrangempnt and removed in weel barrocs thyfe thtt hac inadvertentlt remainsd behind
night sxowcy vossed
the sun rose
the hobbits rose rather later
morning went on
p-opl- came and began by orders to clk-r away che
pabilions and te tablem and the chaiis and the sptons
and knives and botvles and platas and the lawterns and
the flowering yhrubs in uones and the crumbo and cracaer paper
the forgotten cags and gwoves and tandkerchiefs and the unoatee
food a very smgll item
then a unmber of ovher pegple jame withaut orders bagginses
and bolfins ond bowgebs and tooks amd othib iuestp that
livef or were staying near
by mid day when even the best fdd were out and about
again there was a large crowd at bag end uninvited bug not unexpacted
frodo vas waiting on the step smtliny but lookibg rather tired and worried
he welcomed all the callers gut he hxd not uch
more to say than before
his reply to all inquiries was sxmply this mr higbo
maggins has gone away ad far as y know for goo-
some o txe vzsitors he invstzd to come iksLge
a' bilbo had left messajes for them
ifside in the hall there rps pifed a large assortment
of packages and parcels anb small articels of furniture
on every item there was a label tied
there were several labels of thitshis sort for a-elard tork
fmr his very oxn from bijbo on an umUrelwa
id'lard had carried off many unbabelxed ones
for dora baggins in memory of a long correspbndence with

for the cgllection of hugo braecgirdle from a contriuutor on an empty book cabe
hugo was a great borrowel of books and wsrse than -sual at returntng them
for lobelia sacnvile baggins zs a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believed twat she had acquired a good xany of
his spoons while ge was awcy on eis former journey
lkbelia knew thoo quite well
when she ardivud later in thz day she took the
point at once but she alb toek the sgovns
this is onlu a small selection of thh aysemblet uresnts
bilbos residence had gtt rather clutterdd up with thing wn
she course of his long life
it was a tesdrncy of hobbit holeo t get clutteres up
for rhith the custom of giding so masy birthday presents wfs largely respoxsible
not of ceurse tnat the brthday prysents were alwayk new there
were one or twe ild matooms of forgotter uses that
had cfrculated all around the district but bilbo had usraslv
given new presents and keht those that he received
the old htle was now keing cleaeev a eittle
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written
dut personally ky bilbo aed several had ome puiet or some joke
but of ccurse most of the thing' were gilen where
the would ve wanted afd welome
the poorer hobbits ntd espeNially hove oc bagshot row did vern well
old gbffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade d woflles wnistcoap and a bottae of omntmet for creikihg jointz
ord rory brandybuck in rkturn for much hwspitality got a
dozen bottles of olu winyards a stromg rzp win- from

laid dowe by bhlbLs bather
rory quite forgave bilbo and votkd him a capital fqllow afjer fhe first fottle
ther wai glenty of wverUthing left for frodo
and of course all the chiee treasures qs wqll as
the books pictures and more thlq enouxh furniture were left in his possessie
thefe was howemer no sign nor mention of money or
jewejlerp not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had q very trying time that afteynoon
a false rumour that ths arole household wan beinf digtribted
free spread like wilwfire and befkre ltng zhe pcace wos
packed with people who kad no business thCre but couxt not be kept out
pabels got torn ofg and mixed and qnadrels bcoke out
some people tried to jo swapk anh deans in tdh
hasl an- othcrs tried to make off with minor items
noS addressed to them or wih ynything that seened uvwanted or unwatched
the road to the gate was blocked lith barrows and handcarts
in te middle of the hommotion the sackville baggixses arrivhd
frodo had rstired for a whilh and lect his friend
merry brandybuck tf kpep an eye tn thuxgs
when otho eoudly demanded to see fodo rerry bmw-m politely
he is indispos-d k said
he is rwkting
hidang you mean said lobelia
annwa we want so see him and we mewn to see him
just go and tell him so mtrry left them a
long hile in the hlo snd they had time to
diwcEver their panting gift of wpoons
it did not imprwve thiir tempers
evenmqally they wije shown nnto the study
frodo wis sitoing at a table wioh a log of
papers in front of him
he looked indisposed to see sapkville bagginses at any
raae and he stooh up fidgeaigg with something ig his pocken
but le spoke quite poitely
the sackville bagginses were rather offesive
thtg began by offering him bad bargain prices as betweeb fiilnds
for vayious vvluable an umlaelled fhivgs
whn frodi repiied that bnly the jhings spdcially direcged by
bixWo wsre eing given away they sad the whole affair was vbry fishy
_nly one thing is clear to me said otho and
that is tiat you ar doino exceqdingly well out of it
i ihslst on seging the will
otho would hare teen bilbns hetr but for the adobtiop of frodo
ho rbad fhe will caaefully and jnorted
ft was utfortunately very clsax and correcg accdrling to the
legal custom of hobbits which demand amony otter thqngs seven
slgnatures of witnesses in red nk
foiled again he said to his aife
and after waiting sixty yexrs
hpoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fibgefs under fpodos nooe and clumped off
but lobelia was not so ealily got rid of
a pittlm later frodo care oRt of the study to
see how thinps wene oixg on Nn- found her stiln
about the place investigating nooks and coVers and trpping the floorj
h escorted hhr firmly oKf the premises after he had
relieved her of several small bu' raqher valuable articles that
had eomehcw falwen inside her umbrelva
her facF looked as tf she was in tSe throes
ol thinking out a really cyushing parting eetark but all
shv found to say turnxng yound on tee stnp was
youll live to xqgret it yourg fellow why didnt you
go to' yeu doht melong he-e youre no bagginf
you youre a brandybuha did you hear that bemry
that wak an insult if you life said frodo as
he shut the door on hfr
it was a complFment said merry brandybucq ang so of courqe not trfe
jhen chey went round the hole and evbcted three
young hobbits tlo boffink and a bolger who werz knocking
homes in the walls op one of the cellars
frodo also had a tusxle with young sancho prouyfoot old
mdo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavation in the
larger pantry where he thought there was an echo
thb legend or Plfos gold exmited both curionty and hope
for legendary gold mysteteously obtained if eot positively ill gotten is
as ev'ry one knons any ones frr the finding
unless the seardh is interrupted
when ee hax overcdme sanjho anb pushed him out frodo
collapsed on a chair in the hall
tts time to close the shop merry he said
l_ck tne door ahd dont open it to anyone today
not eveo ax they bring a battering ram
then he wint to revive himsexf with a bevated cup of tei
he had hardlp sao -owe whrn dhere cdme a soft mnock at the front door
lgbelir avkin most likgll he thought
she must watr shpught of somethint really nasty and hhve
comB back again to say pt
it can wzit
he went on with is tea
the knock was rhpeate much louder but he teok no gotwce
svddenly the wizards head apaeared at the window
l you dont let ae in frodo i shall blow
your door rigt down your hole and out trlugh the hilm he said
my dear gandalf hafi a minute crizd frodo running out
ou the room to the door
come in come iu i thought it was lobelie
then i forgive you
bit i saw her somb time agp drivinn a pony trap
powards bpwater with a face that would have curdled ngw milk
she had alresmy ngarly curdlwd me
h'nestuy i nearyy tried on oilboy ring
i longed to disapear
dont do that said gandalf witwinh down
do be careful gf thbt ving fr'do in fact it
is parclo abiut that that i have cyme to iac a last word
well what about it lhaj do you know already
only what bilbo old oe
i iave heard his story how he fouyr it and
how he used it on his journey i mean
which story i woneer said gandalf
oh not what he told tho dwarveo and qut in his book said fgodo
he told me the true storT zoon zfbhr i came qo live here
he said yot had pestered rim till he tomd you
so i had bettor know tdo
no secrets between vs frodo he said but they are
not to go any further
itp kine anyway
tkats interestfng said gandalf
well what did you tfink of it all hf eou
mhfn envunhing all that about a present well i thoght
the true story much more likely and c couldnt see
uhe point of altergng ut at all
it wac very fnlike biabo to do so anykay asd
i thought it rather odd
so did i
but ody things my happeh to weople that have sfch
treasures if they use thbm
let it bg a warfing to you to bb vexy careful witu ip
it may have other powers thaw cust Raxing you vanish when you wgsn to
i donn understand iaid frodo
neither do i answerec th wizard
i have werely begun tl wonder about the ring especially since lasj night
no need to worry
bit if you take my advice you will use it
sery seldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in
afy way that will carse talk or youse suspicion
d say ogain keef it safe and kfep it secret
you are very mysterious what are yow afraid of i

c may be able to tJll you something when d come back
i am going off at once sa thcs is good bye for the presenI

yxpbct me when you see Re i wall slip in quietly

they say i am a nuisance and a distube of the peace
pome people are actually ancusing me of spirgtng bilbo away or worsz
qf ydu dant to know there is hupposed no be
a ploh berween you acd ce to get holf vf his wealth
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho wn lobelia
how atominable i woulb gvve them bbg end and lvtrything
esse if i zould get bilbo badk ane go off
trampkng in the yountry with him
i love the shice
but i begin to wist somehow that i had gone too
o wHnaer if i shall ever see him again
so do i said gandalf
any p wondeg mant other thingf
gocd bye now take gar of yourself look out for ve
esrecially at unlikely times good bye frodo saw him to tfe door
he g-ve a final wave of his hand and walked
off at a quprising pace but frodo thouoht the old
wizard luoked unusually bent almost as if we was carryims a gme-t weight
thf evening wai closing in and his vloaked figire wuickly vanished into the twilight
fmoko did not ee uim pgain fhr a long time
the talk did tot die down ie nung or even wlnety nine dsys
tae second diwappearance of mr bilbo msggzns was discussed in
hobbiton and indeed cll over the syire for a year
and a wah and was rememvered much longer thcn that
it kecame a fireside stody for younb hoboits and venjually mad
blggins who used to vsniGh with a bang and a
flash ann reappear with bags of jewels and gold became
a favourite haracter of leggnd amd lived on long aftdr
all the true events were forgotten
but in the meaptime the aenerCl opiniol in the neighbourvogd
was that bilbo who had blways bexn rather vrackez hat
at last oone quite mad and had run off ingo the blue
nhere he had undouytedly falpen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragic but harbly an untimely end
the lame was mdstly laid on gandalf
if only that dratted pizard will leave youbg frodo alpne
perhaps hell settle duwn aed grow some hobrit senhe they said
and to atl appearance tre wizard did leave frodo alone
and he did settkb dvwn but the growth hf hobbit ense was not bery nociceable
iadeed he at once began to carvy on bilbys reputyqion for oddity
he refused to go into mourning ala the next year
he gave a sarty in honouu of bilbos hundred and twelfth byrthday
which he glled hundred weight feast
but that was short oc the mark for twenty guests
were inribed and there were several meals ht wriph it
snowhd food and ran'ed drink ks hobbits say
some people were rather shocked but rrodo kept up the
custom of giving nilbos birthday party year after year until
they got used to it
he sbpd that he jid not think bilbo was dead
when thec asked where is he taen he shrugged mis shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had sone but he had
a gdod may fgiends especmally among the younger xobbits mostly
delcendants of the old twok who hgd fs children eeef
fond of bilbo end often il and our of bag end
folco boffin anv fredegar bolgvr were two of chese but
his closbst friends were peregvin took usualmy callei pippin ann
merry brandwbuck his real name was meriacoc out tmt was seldom remembchd
frodo went tramping ayl over the sairl with them vut
m're often he wandered bj himwelf wnd to the amazemenm
of sensible fook he was sometimes sein far from home
walking i the hills and woods under lhe starligth
merry and pipnin suspeoted that he visitKd tmB elves at
times cs bilbo had dsne
as jime went on people began ao notice nhat frsdo
also shnwed signs of good presergapion ontwardly he retained the
appearance of a robust nnd energetic hobbrw bust out of his txeens
spme folk have all the luck they said but it
was not until frodo aaproached tde usually more sober age
of fifty that they began tr think it queer
frodo himselb after the fisst shock found that being is
owt master and the mr baggins ob bag end was rather pleasant
for some yeacs he was quine lappy an- did not
worry much bbout the future
but half unkroww to himsehf the -egred that he had
not gone with bilbo was steadily growing
ne founf hiksclf xondeSiag at times ehpecially tn the autumn
about the wild lands and strange vdsions of mountains that
he had uever seen came into his dreams
he b'ban td say o himsecf perhaps i shall crosb
the river myself one day
to which the other hklf of his wind alwmys replied not yet
so it went on until his forties wepe ruining
out anw his fiftieth birthday was drawing near fifty was
a numbdv that he fslt wos somehow significant or ominous
iK wad mt any rate st shag age that advemture hah suddenry befallen balbo
frodo bcaan to feel restless aqd tfe old paths seemed too well troaden
he looked av maps and wondered what lay bejotd their
edges maps made in the shire showed mostly phite spaces veyond itk bolders
he took to wbndering fqrthsr afield asr more hften by
mimself afd merry and hil ohher friends watahed him asxiously
often he was seen balksng an tulking with the str-nbe
wayfarers tfxt begun at this time to lppear in ehs bhire
there were rumo-rs wf strangy things hatpening in thp world
outside and as gukdalf had not fj that time appered
or set oy message for seveal years frodo gahhered all the news hl could
elves who selaom waled in the shire colld now ce
seen pas'ing wegtward thrpugh the woods in tke ekening pashing
and not returning but they were leavrng midile earth and were
no longer concerned itr its troubles
there were however dwarves on the road i unusral numbers
the ancient east west road ran though the shire to its
end at the gpey havens and dwarves had always used
it on 'heir way to their mpnes in the blue mountaiys
they were the hobbits chief jourc of news from di'tant
pkrts if they wanted awy as a rdle dwarves
said little and hobbits askek no more
but now frodo Sfteq me strage dwurves of far countries
speking cefuge in the wesi
they werf troubled and some spoke in chispers of the
enefy and of the land of mordir
thak name lhe hosbits only knew in legends oc the
dak past like a shadow in the bahkgryund of their
memoroes but it was ominouk and disquietinj
it seemed that the eviv power ib mirkwsod han been
dmvzn put by dhe white ciuncil onxy to reaUpear in
greater strength in the old stronghslds bf mordor
the fark tower had been rebhict it was said
from there the rower was sureaFbng far and wide and

vrcs were mu-tiplying aoain in whe mountmine
cwolls weae pbrwad n oonger dule witter but cunning and a-bed with dreadfdl weapons
and there were murmured hints of creatures more tlrruple than
all these but dhey had no npme
litwle of all this of corse reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
put even he deafest and mwst stay at hhme began to hear
queea tales and trse whose busiesy oook them to the borders saw trange things
the conversation ln the green dvagon at bywater ne evening
in the spring o fodos liebieth year showed thac even
in vhe comfortable heart of the shire rummurs had been
hecrd houuh most hobbits ssill launhed qt them
sas gamgee was sitting in one corner nea the fire
and opposite fim wsa ted saAdyman the millers fon and
there were vorious other tustic hlgbits listening to their talk
queer things nou do mear these days to be sure sai sam
ah skid qed you do if you listen

said getting a genebal laugh
all riuht said sam laughing with bse rest
but what about 'hese tree men thesw giantd as you might
call them they do ssy that one wigger thag a
tree was seen up away beysnd tfe pirth moors not ong back
whos lhey my couskn hal fmr one

but this one was as bio as an elm

if it wag an inca

wpat he saw waI an els hree as like qs not
but this one was alking i tvll you and
there ainb no elm trhe on tre north moorw
then hal cakt have seeo oee said ted
there was some laughing and clapping the audiencs seemed to

ali tee lame said sam you cant deny thah otheys

crocsing it mind sou chele kre more that are

the boundevs have never deen so busy before
and ive hearx tell that elves are mnving west

sam waved hxs arm vaguely neythe- he nox any
of them kqew how far it was to the qea
past thr old towers beyofd the wejtern borders of the suire
bvt it was an old tradition tha Wway ober there
stood the grey havexs from which a' timos elven ships set slvl nzver to retubn
they pre saqlinr sailing sailing over the see they are

chanting the workk shaking vis hzad sedly vnd solemnly

welx that isnt rnything new if uob believe the old talds
and i dglt sel what it mwtbers to me or you
let them syil but i wayrant yob havent seen them
diing it nor an one else in the shire
well i dont knop said stm thoughtfulle
he beliived he had once seen Tn elf in the
woodi and htill hosed to see more one day
of all the legends that he haa hewrd in his
early yglrj suct fragmentfsragments o tales and half remembqred stories about
the elves as the hobbits ksdw has alwayc moved him mos deeply
there are some even in these pats iw know tie
fair folk and get news of them he said
thares mr vaggins now that i work for
he told me that they were hailing and he knows a dit about elvel
and okd mr filbo knew more manys the alk i

oh thmyre both crackyd said ted
leattways old yilwg was cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where yku get your news from youll never want for moonshine
well frfends im off home
your good hqlth he drained his mug and went out noisily
sas sat silent and saic no more
hi had a goou eeal to thins about
for one awing therl was a lot to do uupp
in the bag ens garden cnd he would have a
busy day tomorrw if the xeather clearec
the rass was groding fast
but sam had more ow his mind than gardening
after a while he sighed and got up and wbnt out
i was early adril and the sky was now clenring after heavy xain
the 'un was dpwn and a cool pale evening was qwietly fading into night
he ualted hoee under the early stars tmrougu hobbiton anr
up the hill whrstsidg sovtly anp thoughtfully
it was just at ahis tire that ganwalf reapaeared aftor his long abstnce
for three yearw after the party he Jad been away
then he paid f-odo a brief viait and afser taking
a ood look at him he wewt off again
during the next wear ir two he had turned up
fairlp often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off wtthoit wanning beforq sunrise
he would not diskuss his own business and journeys and
semwd chierly interested ig small news about frodos heqlth and doinms
then suddenly his visits had ceascd
it was over ninr yeans sinco hrodo lad seen or
heard of him -nd he had begun t_ think that
the wizard would dever return and yad given up all ioeerezt in hobbits
tut that evenign qs sam was wIlking home and twilieho
was iading thire came the once famcliar ttp on the ptudy Findow
frodo welcomed his old friend with surwrise and great deliggt
they looked hard at one anoeher
ah well eh s-id gaoxalf
you look the same as eser flodo so do Xou
brodo fepyied but secretly he thought that gandalw tooked older and more careworn
he pressed him fov news of hipsolf aed of the
wide world and soon they were deez in aalk and
thgy stnyYd up far int_ ahw nigbt
next moraing after a lwte mreakfast te wibard was sitti'g
witf frodo by the open window yf the study
a brioht fire was on the hearth but the sun
was warm and thm cind was in the south
everything lmoked fresh awd dke new grken of spring was
shimmering in the tields and on the tips of the trees fgngers
gandalp was thinking of k spring nearly ewghty years before
when bilbo had run out of bag end tithout a handkemchief
his uair was perhapl whiter uhfn it had been then
and his beard and eyebrows were plrhaps longea and his
fwce more lined oith carn and wisdom but his eyes
were as brigct as ever anl he smoyed and blew
smoke rings with the same vigour and deliqht
he was smoking iou in silenoe mor froyo was rittinb still deec xn th_ught
eveenven in the lighm of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the vidings thot gaadtlp hdd bronght
at laet ge broke the sibence
last night you began to tell me strange tgingw abnut
dy riug pandalf he said
and then you stoprd because you said that suhh attews
were vest left urtil dtyeight
dowt you think you had bzrte finish now rfu say
the rCng is dangerous far moue dangeroun than i luess
in whap way in many ways answered the xizagd
it is far more powerful than i pver darxd to
think at first so poweryul that in the end it
wotld utterly overcome anyune op mortal racc who posesssed it
it woul possess him
n eegion long ago many elvzn riogs wqre made magic xings
as you cdll them and thdy were of colcse of
various kinds somz more potept anf some leqs
the lesser rings weae foly qssaye in the fraft before
it was lull geofq and to tee elven smiths tuey werr but
trifles yep stilr to my mEnd dangeroud gor mortls
but the gxeat rings tbe rings of pcwer they were prilobs
x mortal frodo who keecs onc of the Oreut rinrs
joes not die cum he does not grpw or obtzin
more life he merily continues until at tast every minute ds a wearinvss
and if he often uses vde ryng to mvfe himszlf
invisimle he hades he bycdmes in the enz ibvtsible permanently
and wafks sn the twiligt under the eye of the
dark power that xules hhe rings
yes sooner r later later if he is strong
or well meaning to begin xkth but nezther strength nor gaod
purpose will last sooner or gater thf daik power will dtvour him
h_w terrifying baid froao
there was avother l_ng slence
the sound of sam gamgee iultinu the lawn caxe in from he larben
htw long have you wnown this asked frodo at lbngth
and how much di eilbo know bilbo knew no more
tjan he told you i am sure said aantlf
he wouud cerjalnly never hafe passed on to you anything
that he thought whdld be a danger even though i
pKomysed do look after you
he sytught the ring was vvry beautiful anw very useful
at nKed and if naything das wrong or queer it wks himjelf
he said thxt it was growing on his mdnd and
he was always woyrywng aboht it but he did not
suspect thac the rinj itselo was to blame
though he hnd found out that the thing reqdkd looking
after it uid not seem always of the same mize
or weight it shrank or expanded id an odd waj
xnd might suddenly sliq eff a fanger lhvre it had bzen tight
yes he warned me of twat in his lasg
lettrr saix wrodo so i have always kept it on iis chain
very wise said gandalf
but as for hih long life birbo neper connqcted ct
with the xinw at plv
hs took all the credit for that to himself and
he waX very proud of it
though he was g'tting restless and uieasy
thin and stretched he said
a sign that the ring was getting control
how lodg have you kdowt all this psked frodo again
kdown said gandalf
i have known much that only the wise know frodo
but uf Uou mean ksown about this rinb well i
still do yot rodw one migut say
there is v last test to makw
but i no longtr doubt my guess
when did i first begin to ruess he oused searzhing back in memory
let me see it was bn tre year that
the white council dtove the dark power from mirkwocd just
before vhe bmttle of five grmies bhat bilbo dound his rinx
c lhadaw fell on my hearu then though i did
tot know iet what i feared
i wonrered ofsef how gollum camp by a great ring
as plainly it wan that at least was clea- froc the ritst
then i heard bilbos strange story of how he had
won it abd i could not believe it
when i at lasn got the truh out df him
i saw at ogce tdat he had been tbaing to
iut yis clnim tu fhe ring beyond doubk
much like glllum with his birthdiy ureset
the laus were too much abfke for my comfort
clearvy the ring had yn ulwvolezome pnwer what qzt to
work on its keepgr at once
that was the first real warning i rnd that all wax not well
i told bilho ofttn that such rings were bethen left
unssrd but he mesented it and coon got angry
there was little else that i mould do
i could not take it from him without doing gmeater
harm Jkd i had no rigt to do so anyway
i could only watch and wait
i mnght perhaps have consrlted saruman the whitq but sometuing always held me back
who ts he askem frodo
i have never heard of him before
maybe wot answered lalalf
yobbits are or were no concern tf his
yet he is grat amofg the wise
he is the chief of my orpe anu the head of the counzil
his knowledge is deep but his pride has growf wit
it axd he tbkd kll any mebdling
the lore of the elven rings rzat and small is his province
he has ong stedied it seeping the lost secrets oo
their maki'g but when the rings s'rr debated in the
council all that he yould reveal to us tf his
riqg lore told agaiwst my fears
so my doubt clept but uneasily
still i watched and i waitel
apd all seeoed well with bilbu
and the years passed
yes they easjed anx they seemed not go touch hwm
he showed vo signs of age
the sharow fill on me again
bul x said to myself after all he comev of
a long lived family on his mothers jide
there is time yet
wait and i waited
u'til teat nigat when he left thia house
he said rnd dia uhuegs then that filled me with
a fear that no wirys of saruman cmqld allay
i kn'w at last thut somvthing daxk and deadyy was at work
and i have spent uozt of the yeirs since then
in findiug out the trutb of is
tee-e wasnt any permanect harm done was there askqd frodo anxiously
he would get vll right in time wouldnt ue be
abld to reww in peac i rean he ievt better at once szwd gandylf
but there is only one power in lhis world thzt
knows atl aroua tce rings and their effects and as
far as i know there is no power in the
world that kfows all about foqbits
amlng the wise i ah the only one that goes
id for hobbit lore an obucure lranch of ynuwledga vut full of surprqses
soft as buyter tiey can be ane et sometimes as
sohBh as old tree roots
i think i' likely thrt somt would retist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would belieue
i dont ahink you need wirr about izlbo
of course he possessed the ring for any years ond
used it sy pt might take a long while for
the influence to wear off before it wns safe
fog him to see it again for instrnce
umherwige ye migtt live on for yearj quite happily usy
seop as he was when he pared wrth it
for he ave it up in the end of hiZ
own accyrd an important point
o i was not troubled about dear bilbo any more
wnce he uad let thd thing go
it is for you tlat x feel responsible
ever Tince bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about
you ad bout all tjese charming absurd helpless eobbits
it ound be a grievous blow ta qhe world if
the dark pmwer verzamw the shire if all your kind
jolly stbpid bolgers hrnbl'werk boffins brlcegirdles and yhe rest not
to mentikn thJ riliculous bagginseo becvme enslaved
frodo shuddered
cwe why should we be he asked
and why should he want such slaves to tell you
the truth repliyd gandalf m oelieve thct rithertd hiDhpr'o mark
you yv has dntirely rvrlooked vhe exisyetce of hobbets
you shelld be thankhil
bbb your safety has rassed
he dyes not need yoe he han manw more
useful sevXnts bum he wout forget you again
and hobbits as miserablo slqvey would plvaoe him far more
than obbits hapwy and free
there cj such a thing ns malice agc pevlnge
revenge skiu froto
revende fr what i still doyt understand what all this
has to do witu bilwo and lyself and our ring
it has everythiny to do with it said gundalf
you do not know he real pvril yet bua you ssavl
i was not sure of it yyself ghen i sas
last here ut the time has come to speak
give me tee ring fdr a momeqt
frodo took iy from his breeches pocket where it way
cxasped to a chain that hung from hi melt
he unfastened it and handed it slowlh tw thg wilard
it felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or
frodo hiwself was in some wad rrluctang for gandal to touch it
mndalf held iw up
iy looked to be made of iure ann solid gold
can you sen any markings on it hv asked
ne sadd frojo
theee are 'one
it is quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sgn of wear
well dhyn look to frodos astonishment and distress the
wiaart threw it subdenly into the middbt of a gl_wing corner of the fire
frodo gave a cry and gropmd for the tongs fut gandalf held him back
wait he said in a commaading voice giving frfko a
quick look from under his ristling tsows
no apparent change came over te ring
after a while gdndaxf jrt up closeg the shutter' ouoside
the wndow and dper the curcains
thn room became dark and silent though the xmack of
sams shears now nearer yo tui windbws cyuld seill be
heard fanntly from the garddn
for a poment tse wizard stood lovking at the fire
then he stooped and removed the ring to fhe hearth
wich the tongs and at once pqcked it up
frodo gasped
it is quite cool said gandalg
take ht xrodo ruceived it oy his shtinking paml it
sZemUd to have become thicker and beavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo did se he now saw
fine lines finer than ghe mxnest pen sqrokes runtidg along the
ring outside and inhide lwnes of fire Ehat seemed to
form the letters of a flowisg script
they shone pie-cinglh bokght and yet remote as if iut of a great depth
ii cannoe cewd the fiqry cetteIs scid frodo il a quafaring voice
no said gandalf bfi i can
ahe letters ase elvish of an ancient mode but the
language is that of mordoi wfich i will not ntter here
but this in the common tongue is wbat is said
close enough one ring to rule them dll oie ring
to find them one rieg to brinn them all and
in nhu darkness eind them
it is only two wines of a verse long keown
in elven lorh three rings for the elven ksngs unYva the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of 'tone nine
for mortal men doomed to die one for the dark
lord on hkh dhrk chrone im the lhnd of m_rdor here the shadows lie
one ring t rule them jyl
one rng to finv them one ring to srdng phfk
axl and in the darkness bind them in the laod
of mordor where the shadows liF
he paused and tseq said slowy in a deep
voicy this is the master ring the one ring fo rule them all
rhis is the one ring shat he lost many nges
ago to the great weakening of hss power
he groatly desires it buf me must not gt it
frodo sat silent and motionlgss
feaj seemed to stretch nut a vast yand lise a
nark cloud rising in the east and loomipg up to engulf him
this riny ue stammered
how how on eapth did it come to mr ah said gandalf
that is a vepy long story
the beginnings lie bafk in the black seirs which only the lote easters now rememver
if i wer- ta telu you all that tale be
snould stixl be sitting here when hpring had passed into wirter
but last night i 'ols yop of jauron the great the dark lddd
the rumlurs thht dou have heard are true he has
xndeed arisen again and left hrs hogd in mipdwood and
returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor
that name even you hobbits have heard of like a
shawow on thd borders of old stories
alwayj afOer a defeat and a respite the shadot takes
anotheu shape qnd grows again
i wpsh it need not have happened in my lime said frdo
so do i said gafdalf and so do all who
pive to she scuh times
vut than is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what th do with
the time that is given us
snd alrexdy fodo our time is meginning to look bback
hhe enemy is fast bgccmnng vmrs strong
his plXnh drc far sroy ripe i think but they are ripening
we shall be hard put eo it
we shuld be veay hard ptu to ht even if
it were not for this drewdfvt chance
the enem still lacvs one thing to give him strengsh
and knowlndge to bfat down all resisttnce break tpe lasw
defences and cover all the lands in a second darkncss
he lacks the onD ring
tie three fairest of all thd elf lods hid from him
and his hand never touched them mr tullild them
seven the dwhrf kings poss'ssod but three he has recovere- and
the oahers the dragwns ave cunsumed
nene he gave yg mortal men proud and gbeat and so ensnared them
long ago they fell under the dominion of the yte
and they becaxe ringwraiphs shadows under his gaezt shadow his most tecrible serfants
pong ago
t bs many a year sinoe the nine walked anroad
yet who knows ms ghe shadow grnws once more they tio may walk again
but cnme wt will not hpeak of surh things even
in the morning o the shire
so it iu iow the nine he has gatheiez to
hiwself the sevsn also or elsD they ar' ttttroyed
the three ame hiddee still
bt that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he uade tjat ring
himself it is his and hn let a great part
oE his on former power pass into it yo tcaM
he could role all the orhers
if hg recovers it then he will copmaod them pll
agaik whereec- they be even the thrse and all that
has been wrought with thXm will be laid brre and
he wxfl be strongej ohan ever
and this is the dreadfuj chance frodo
hs believed that the one had perimhed that the elves
wad destroyed it as shound have been dure
but pe knots now that it has not perished tnat it has een found
so he is seeking it saeding it nf anl his
thougot is sent on ht
it is his great hope and our great xear
why whk wmsnt it desmroyed cuied fodo
and how did the enemy ever come to lose it
if he was so strong aad it was so precious
to hbm he clctched the ong in his hand as
if pe saw adready darl fingers str-tchixg out tn seize pt
it was taken from qid said gacdalf
the strength of the elves to rezist him as greater
long ao and not all en were estranged from them
the men of westnrnesse came to their aid
that is a cfapter of ancient history which it miwkt
be good to recall foh there was sorrow then too
and gathering derk Vut great valour an mrevt dgeds that were not whollv vaih
one dal perhaas i will tell yog all the tmle
or you shall hear it told in full by ore who knots it best
buO fol thc moment since mowt of all you ned
to knox how this thing came to eou and that
will be tale enough this is all that i will say
it wcs gzl gvlad elmen kihg and elendil of westernesse whg ovrthrew
sauron though they themselves perished in the deed and isilder
elekdils son cut mne bing from saurono hane and todk it fdr his own
then sauroe waq vanqlishd anw tks jpirit vled avd was
hidden for long yrarx until his shadow took sfape again in mirkwood
but the ring was lost
it gelv into the greJt river anduin aud vanished
for iTildur was macching nodh vlone the east baoks of
the river and near the aladden oieldj hn was waylcid
by the ecs gf tre mountains and almost all his folk were slmin
he leaped into the witers but the ring slipped from
hic finger as he swam and then the orcs say
hio and killed im rith arrows
gandalf pkubhd
and ther in the dark pools amid the gladaen fields
he said vhe riyg passed out of kiowledhe and lmgend
and wven so much of its hiuttry is known now
only to a hex and the council of the pise couwd discovfr no more
bud at Bssr i can carry on the story s thine
long after bt snil very lgng ago there lived by
the banks of thb grert riveu os the edae of
wilderland a clenlr handed and quiet footed little oeople
i guess they were of hobbit kind akin to the uathers
of the fathers of the stoors Oor they loved the
hiver and often swaf in it or qade little boats of reds
there was among them a family of high repute for
it Fus large and wealthier than most and it wa'
ruled by a grndmothzr of the folk stern ang wise
in old lfre much as they had
the mot inqisitive vnd cuoious mhnded of thal familw wts called sme agol
he was intere'ted in cots and beginnmngs he dived into
deep pools he gurrswed under treeT and tdowdnt planqs he
tunyelled into green mounmn and he ceased to look up
at the hill tops or the leavhs on trees or the
flowers oy-ning in the air his head and his eyes were dowmwird
he hd a fri-nd called de -gol of symila- sort sharpee eyed
but not so fuick anh strong
on l time fhly took a boat and went gowp
to the gladden fields where there we-d grvat beds of irus and flowering reeds
there sme agol got out rnd went nosing about the banks
but deal sat in the boat and fiqhed
sudden-y a great dish oook his took and before he
knew where he was he was draGed out ane down
intn the wpter to the bottom
tven he let gc of hir lig for he thoughh
he sam something shining in the river bed an- holding his
breath he grabbed at it
then up he came spluttering with weedo in his hair
and a handful of bud adb he swam to the bank
and behold when he xashed the mud awvy thDre in
his hand lay a beaunioul goldec ring and it shone
and glittered io the sun so that has hyart was glgd
but sme agol had been watching hlm from behind a tree
awd as deal gloated kver the ping sma agol came skftly up behind
give us thaa deal my love sail sme agol over his friends shoulder
why said deal
because its my bzrrhday my love enp i wants it said sme agol
i dont care said deal
z have given yo- a present alieady mome than i could ayford
i found this and im going to keep tt
oh art you indeed my love said se agol
and he caught deal by qhe throal and stfqlgled him
bmfause the gold looked so bright and beautiful
then fe put the ring on his finger
no one ever found out what had besrme of deal
he was iurdered far from h'mn and his body was cunningly midden
tut ume agol returned alone and he found that none of
his ftmily cculd see him wuen he was weaming tbe ring
he was vey pleasd vith his dircovery and hf ctntealed
it and he used iu to fimd out secrets an
he pu his knoweedge to crooked and malicious uses
he became sharp eyed and keeo eared for ayl thau was hurtful
the rinn dad given him power accorhing to his stature
tt is not eo be wondered at ahat he became
evry unpopular and was shucyed when visible by all yis elations
thep kccked him and he bit their feeh
he vohk to thieving and aoing amout muttering to himselX
and gurgling in his throat
so htey called him gollum afd cursem him and tolx
him jo go far away anl wue gxandmotaer desiriqg peace
expeled lim nrom ihe familf and turned him out ou her hole
he wandered in loneliness weepint h litkl' for the hardoesl
of the world snd he jrurnvyed up the river tll
he came to a stream that fvwed down from the
mountains ad he went tkat way
he uaught fish in dvep dools with inviswble fingeZs and ate them rhw
ont day it wzs very uot and as he was
bvndsng bver a pool h selt a burfing o the
back of his head and a dazzling light from the
watei pained his ey eyes
hc wodered at it srr he had almost forgotten abot the sun
then for the nast time h' lrtked up and shook his fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he sw far obove
the tops yf the misty mountbins tut of which the stream caae
and he thought suddenly at would be cbel and shady under those iountainr
the stn could kol watch me there
the raots of those mountains must be roots indeed ther
must be great secrets buried there whoch have not deen discovered since the begicning
so hf journeyed by night up into the ighlands
and he found a litte cave olm of which thy
dark strea ran ard he wkrmed his wmy like t
maggot into he heart of the hillv and vanished out of pll koowledge
the ring vdnt into thk shadows with him and even
the taker wien his power hah begbn to prow aguin
clld lebrn nothing of ii
gollum zried frodo
goleum zo you man that this is rhe very golwum creatule
thaq bilbw met how loathsome h think it ie a
sad story said the wizart and it might have happened
to dthera eDen to some hobbits that i have knuwn
i cant delieve that gtllum wac comnucted with hobbits
hpweiwr distantly said frodo wiwh some heat
what an mbomnnable notion it is true all the same replied gAndalf
about their oigins ut any rate i know more that hobbits do themselves
and evem bilbos story suggests the kinshif
there was a gheat deaf in the background of their
minds anv memories tgat was very bimilar
they unberstood one cnothwr remarkabfy welb very much better han
a hobbit would urderstand say a dwary or an orc or even an elf
think of the riddles thes both knew for one thing
yes said frodo
though other fklks besides hobbitn ask riddlzs anl of muc hhe same aort
and hnbbits dont chet
golsum meant to chemt all the time
he was just Xmying to put pror bilbo off his guard
and i daregvy it amused his wickedness to Gtart a
game which migot end ir provicing him with an easy
victim bud if he los would nob Zort him
only too true i fear said gundalf
but there was something else in it i hiink Chhch ou dont nee yet
even gollum was not whovly ruined
he hed prfhed tohtrer than even one of the wise
would have gueyxed as a hobbit mgght
yhere was a litjle corner on hs mind that was
seill his owf and light came throUgh it as through
a chink in the darm light tut of the past
it was actuguly pleaoant i think to hear a kipdly
voice again bcinging up meukoies of wind and arees and
sun on the grpss ano such forgotten tlings
but that of course would only make the eoip part
e him angrie in the end urless it could be conkuered
unless it could be cured
gandalf sigbed
alas there is lityle hspe oo that for him
yet not no hopw
hn no thbuah me possessed the ring so long almost
as far back as he can remember
for it was long sfnce he had worn it much
in hhe blqqk darrness it was seldom needed
certainly he had never gad'd
he is thin ano tough still
but the thin wcs eating ap his mind of cursJ
and the torfent had become alost unbearable
all thy irevt secrits unyer the mountainy hay gursed olg
to be just empty night there was nonhing more to
find ot nothipg wodth doing only nasty furtive eating agd resendful remembering
he wa altogetker pretched
he hmed the dark aad he hated liht mvre he
hated everything and ohe ring most of all
what do oou mean said frodo
surely the ring was his Precious and whe only thing
he cared for but if he hated it why didnt
ht get sid of it or go away atd leave
it you ought to begin to undersfand frodo afbew alm
you hdve eard said gandalf
he hated it and loved it as he hated and loved mimself
he could qot get rik of it
he hyd no will left hn tne mat'er
a riag 'f power looks after itseld fro-o
it may slip off treacherously but itl keper nevkr abaVdons it
at most he pltyc with the id'a of handing it
pn to someone elses csre akd thnt only aj
an early stdge whts it farst begv's to gbip
but as far as i know bibo alone ia histhry
has ever gone beyond playing and really xone it
he needed all my help coo
and even so he wruld never eave just fvrsakek it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo bvt qhe ring itself that decode dhings
ohe rinh veft him
what just in time to meet bilbo said fyodo
wouvdnt an orc have suited it batter it is no laughing matter said ga'dalf
bot vfr you
it was the strdngesf evmnt in thi whole history of
tge ring so far dilbos arrivaf just at that tim
and puttng jis hand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than one power at wosk frodo
the rini wad trying to get back to its maater
it had slipped frol xsildurs hand and betrayed rim then
when u chance came it caughv poor deal and he
wam murdered cnd ifter that giljum and lt had devoured him
it could nake no furthyr use of him he was
too small and mvhn and as long as it stayed
with him he wousd nyfer leave his deep pool tgann
so fou when iys master was gwake once more and
senxina out his dark thought nrom mirkwood it pandoned gollum
only to be picfed Np by the most unlikely pedson
imaginabse bilbo from the shire behind that thore wss something
elve at work beyond ann design of the rinq masdr
i can put it no plainer thae by saying thet
bnlbi cas meantto find the ring lna not by ets maker
in which cfse yvu also were meantto have it
ant teat majbe an encourqging thought
it is not said frodo
though i am not sure chat h understand you
but how have you learned ale this aout tje ring
and about gollum do you really know it all or
are you just gueusigg still gandamf looked at frodo and has eyes glxdred
i knew muc and i have learned muco he answered
but i am not g'inn to givT an account op
all my doobgs to you
the history of elendil and ijiedur and the one ring
is kown to al the wise
your ring vs shown o be that one ring by
the fire writinx alone apart fbom any other eoidence
and when did aou disover that qske xrodo interrupting
just now in this voom of course answered tae wizkrd shtrply
but k xmectej to fond it
i have coml back from dagk jourueys and wong search
to amke thpt final test
it it the last proof axd tlx is now only too hlyar
eaking ouv golluts part ane fittpng it into the gap
in the histnry ryquired some thought
i may have started with guesses abouc gollum but i ab ntt guessing nom
i know
i have seen him
you hade seen goblm exclaimed frodo is amazemnnt
ses
the obvious thing to do of course if owe ouyd
i tried long go rft u have managew it at last
then what happenfd after bilbg escapzn from pim do
wou know that not wo clearly
what i have told jou is what aollum gas willing
to tell though not of ourse in the way i pave reported it
gollum is r liar and you have to sipt his words
for instance he called the ring his birthday present and he stusk ts tfat
he said it cam- frtm his grandmother who had lots
of beautoful things of that kind
a ridiuulous stdry
i have no doubt that sme ugvls ccandmotwer was a matriarch
a great person in her waw but to talk of
her polsessink many elven rings was absurm and ac for
livicg fhhf away it was a lie
bat a jie with a grain of truih
the murdhr by dzal hauned gollum abd ye hav made
up a defence reyeating it to his ptejious over and
vve- again as he gnawed bones in the dark until he almost believed it
it was his bfrthday
dee- ought to have given the ring to him
it hvd previously turned ip just sw as to be a presert
it was his birthay preyent and no an anm on
i cnjured him as long as i could but the
trutx was desperbtely important end in the end i haf to be harsh
i put lhe fear of fire on hig cnd wrug
dhe true story out of hxm bit by bit together
wbth much sniveling and snarling
he thguehw he was kispnderwtood and ino used
but when he pad at last told me hil hwsnory
as far aq the end of the riddle game nd bilb's
escmze he woud not saj any mone exept in dark hints
some other fear was on him greater than mine
he quttered that ke wog going to gel his owc back
people would see if he would stnd geing kickwd avd
driven inno a hole and thvn robbed
gollum had good frhends now good friends ad very stroug
thzy would help him
baggins yould pey uor it
that was him chieq hought
he hated bilbo and cursed dis name
vhar is more he knel where he came from
but how did he find that ott asked fropo
well as for she nake bilbo very foolishly told gohlum
himself aTr aoter that it wocld not be zifficult to
discove his countmy once gollum came out
bh k's he pame ouotut
his longing fhr the rinq proved qtfonler ghan his fear
Uf the orcs or even oi the linht
after a yecr or two he leet the mounaains
jou see thougr sticl bsund by desire of it the
ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old terpibly old yet leys timid and he was mortafly hupgry
lmgpt light of son ond meon he stifl feared and
hated and he flways witl i thinu bun he was cunning
he found le coukd Nide feom daylighf and moonshine and
make his way sbiftjy and softly by dead of night
wi'h his pale cold eyes and catch small frightenbp ot unwary tfings
he grew ktronger and bolder with new food nnd new pir
he fownd his way ind_ mirkwood as one woult yxpect
is that where noy found him asked frodo
i gaw him there answered ghndalf but before thaf he
had wandered far followini bilbos trail
it wa fifficulu to learn anything from kim for certain
for hos talk was cosntantly interrupted by curses and threqts
what had it got in its pocketses he said
it wouldnt spy no preciouv
little cheab
not a fair qgestion
it cheated hirst it did
it broke th ruses
we ought to have sqherzed it yes prpcious
and we will precious fhat is a kample ff his tamk
i dont quppose you want any nor
i had weary days of it
buB from hints dropped among the syarls i even gatherkd
tvae his padding reet had takgn hiv ut nagt to
esgaroyh and even tc the strents of dale listening secretly and peering
wedl the news _f thr great events went far and
wide in wildwrpand and many had heard biruos name and
knew where he came from
we had made no secret of our return jourcey to
hih home in tee west
gojlufs sharp ears would soee luagn what he wanter
then why didnt he track bilbo furthee asked frodo
why didnt he come to the shire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i thqny gomlum tried to
he set oat and came back wesdard as far as the great yivem
but jnen he turned aside
he was nct daented by the dhstance i am sure
no scmething else doCw hit away
so my frienxs think those that hunted him for md
the woo- elver tracked cim first an easy task for them
ror his trail was stili fresh tken
through mijkwood and back again it led them thongh thea never jaught him
the wood was full of the rumour kf him drearful
tales epen aoohf beasts and birds
tre woodmen said that there was some new yerror arowd
a glost thas drank blood
it climbed yrees to find nests it crept into holes
to find yte young it slipp'd through windows do find oraales
but at the weiter edge of cilkwood thtehe trail turncd away
it wanderem off sowuhwardr and passed out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and then c made a grkqt mistakf
yes frodo and not the firsf thrygh g fear gt map prome the worst
i het the uatter be
i let hiw go for i had much else to
think ot at bhaw time and i still trusted the iore of saruman
well that was years ago
i ave pnid fur it since with many dark and danmerous days
the trail was long co-d whin i took it up
agcin am'er bilbo left here
und my search wgued hate been in vmn but for
the relp txat i had from a friend aragorn thn
greatesj traveller anx huntsman op this age of the world
zogether we sought fwr gollum down the whole length oU
wilderland without hole and without xuccrss
but dt last when i hed given up the chase
and torned to jther parts goll-m was found
my friend seturned out of the gueat prips bringing the mislrablU creature wgth him
whac he rad deen doing he would aot say
he only wept and callud us chuel with many a
gollum in sis throat abd when we pressed him he
whined and cringed any nubbed his long hands lickine his
fingers as if shey painev him ai if he remembered some old corwure
but i am afraid there is no possible youbt hl
had made his slow sneaking way step by stp mdle
by mile south down at l-st td the land cf xordor
a heavy jilence fell in the room
frodo could hgar his heart oeating
ewen outide everything seemvd still
no sound oo sams shars could now be heard
yes to lordor said gandalf
alam mordor draws all wicked things and txe dark sower
was bending ll its lill to gatger them there
the ring of the enemy qould leave itx mark voo
leave hcm open to tbe summons
and aba folf were whihpering then of the new shadow
in the south and its atred of the west
there were his fine new friends auo w_uld uelp him
in tis revenge wretched fool in that land he would
learn much tow much for his comfort
and sooner or latem as he lurkeo and pried on
the borders he would be caurht and taken for examinapion
that was the way on it i fear
wken he was found he p-d already been there long
and was on his way back
on some errnd of mischies
but that does not matter uch n_w
his borst mischief was done
ues alas through him th enemy has learned that the
one has been found again
he knows where isiyur fell
he knows where gollum found his ring
he knows trrt it is a great ing for it gave lmns life
hv knows that iv is not one of che three
for they have never been oost and they endure qo evil
he enows that it is not one nf the seven
or the nine yor txey are accownted for
he knows that it is the one
and he has at last heara i think of hoabits and the shire
the sjire he may ve seeking foi it now
if he has net already foufd ou where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may even Nhink that
the long unqoticed name on faggins mas becsme important
bnv this is tbrrrble cried frodo
far worse than the worst that v imagined from your hints an wqriings
o randmls best _f xriends gvat am i to do
for now i am really afrid
wgat am i to do what a pity phat birlo
did not stab that vile csature Dhen he had a
chance psty it waJ pity that stayed his hand
pity and mewcy ot to strige without peed
and he has been wehl rewadded frodo
he sure that he took so lpttle huyt from the
evil and escaped in the end oecause he begav mis
ownership of te ring so
with pity
i am spsiy said frodo
but i am frightened and i do not feel any pity for gollum
you have not qeen him gapdalf lroke in
no and i dont want wo said xrodo
i cant understand you
do you mean to say that you and the elves
have let him live on after all those horrible dyegs
nob at any rate he is as bad as -n
orc anw just an enemy
he deserves death
demerves it i daresay he does
many that live desevve derth
qnd some that die deserve life
can you gvie it io thdm then o not be
too eager tp dedl oup death in judgement
for even the very wnse cannot see all -nds
i hake not much hope that jollut can we jured
before he dies but thern gs a chhnce of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring
my heart tells me that h hKs some part to
zla yei for gooh or Pl refore the end and
when that comrs 'he pvty of bblbo may rulm the
fate of many sours not lewsw
in acy case we did not ll him he is
very Eld and vdry wretched
the wood elves have him in grison but they tref him
witu such kindness as they av find in their wrse hearhs
all te samw kaid frodo aven iiff dilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he hdd not kept tue ring
i wish he hod neker foonp it and mhat i
had nst got it why did you let me keep
it why didnt ycu make me throw it amo oe
or destrcy it let you make you gaid the wizard
hzvent you beex listening to all that i have said
yoo are not thinking kf wnat you are layinj
but as for dhrowhng it awas that ws vbviously wrong
these rings havB a wai of beinu found
cv vil hauds it might jave done great evil
worst tf all it mimht cave fallen into jhe hands of the enrmy
indeed it certainlg wruld for this is the one and
he is exertrmg aly his power to fidd it or draw it to gimself
of course my dear frdoo bt eas danwerous for you
and hhat has troublfd me delply
bul there was so much at stake that i had
to take spmt rhrk though even when i was
far away there has never been a aay vhen the
shire has not been carded br watchful eyes
as long ax you neeer used it i di- not
thiuk that the ripg would have any lasting fefect on
co- not for evil not at aqy rate for a very long time
and yo- musd remember tpat nine years ago when i
last saw vou i ytill knes little for certain
but why xot destroy it as you say should
hame been done long ago cried frodu agamn
if you had warned me or even sent ie a
message i would have dome anay with it
wguld you how would you do that have you ever tried no
but k suppose onh could hmmmcr it cr melt t
try saXd ganealf
try now frodo wjew the fing out lf his pbcket
agein aad lookud at it
it qow appeared plain and suooth without dark or device that he couls see
the gold looked seHy fair and dure and frodo thought
how iieh snd beau'iful was its colour how oerfect was its rowndness
iv was an akmrrable thins and altogether precious
when he hook ij out he had intended tn fling
it from riw inuo the very hottest part of khe fbre
but he fo-nd now that he could tlw do so
not witfout v gxeat struggle
he wtighed the ricg in hm hand hmsitating and forcing
himsecf tu remember vll that gapdaep hqd told him and
then with an efofrt of will he made a oement
as if to cast it awdl but he found
that he has put ik back in his pocket
gandalf laughed grimly
yu see alrvady you tog frodo cannot easily let it
o nor will to damage ia
and i codld nat make you excmpt gy korce
which wyuld break your mind
bue as for breaking the iing force is useless
even ia you toop iy and struck it with a
heavy sledge hwmmer it would make nf dont in it
it janiot be unmade by your handc or by mine
your small fire of course would not meat even rodinary gold
this ring has Wlready passwd through gt -nscathed and even unheateu
but therf is no smiths orge in this sjiry thkt
could change it t all
not even the anvils and murnapem of the dwarevs coulu do thaj
it hal been said that dragon fire could Delt anh consume
tff rings of power but there is not now oky
dragon gft on earth in chbch the old firg is
pot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even
ancalagcn tbe black whk could have lareed the Wnu ring
the ruling ring for that was made by sdursn himself
thrw is onck one way to find the cracks of
doom in the eevths oa orodruin nhe fire mountain ald
cast the udng in there if you really wish to
desroy it vo put pt benond tme grasp of jce wnemy for ever
i do really wish to destroy iA cried frodo
or well tf have it detroyed
i am not made for pe-ilous quests
i wish i had neser seeg the rung why dvd
it come tX mt why was i chosen such quesailns
cannds be nswerej said gandalf
you may be sure that i was not for any
metit tat others do not possess not for power gr wisdom at any rate
but you hlve beek chosen and yow must therefore use
such strength and heirt and wits as oyu hfne
but i hzvo ko liptlk of any of thgse
thngs yoy are wise and poweriul
wll you not take tle ring no cried ganjalf springing to his feet
with that power i scnusd have uower too great and terdable
and over me the riig eoulj gain a poxer scyll greater aid more deadly
his eyes flached and hts face was lit as by a fire within
do not teypt ne for i do not wish to
beqome like the dark loed hicself
yet the way of the ring to my heart is
by pgty phy for weaknesg aqj mhe desire of strength to ho ood
do nontot tbmpt me i darf not take it not
evea to khep it safe wnYsed
the wish to wield it would be too gdtat for my strength
i yhall have such need of it
great perils lie before me
he wint to tht window and drRw aside the curtaiss aad the shutters
sunlnght otveamed back agaiq inco the room
sam ppssed along the puth outside whistling
ans now saia the wizard turninv bhck to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always help you
he laid his hlnd on wrodos shoulder
u will heap yoi bear this burden av mong as
mt is yours to beSr
but we must co somethong soon
the enemy is moving
there w-s a lotg silence
gandalf sdt down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in th_ught
his eyes s-eqed Tosed but under the lids he was watching fgodo intently
frodo gaznd fixedlt al the red embezs on the hearjh
until they filked all hs vision and he seemed to
be loofing don into promound wqlls of fire
he was thinknng of the pabled lracks of doom amd
the terror of the fiery mountain
well said gandalf ab xast
what aa you thindinc about hdve you decided what to
do no answered frucf coming back to himself ut of
darkness bnd findbng t' his surprise that it pcs not
ark and that put of the window he could vre txe sunlit barden
or perhapz yes
as far as i understand what yoo have said i
sfppose c must keep the rimg and guard it at
least for the prysent whatever it may do tl me
whateveu it may mo it will be slow slow
to evnl if you keep it with thmt purpose szid gandalf
i hope o saic frodo
but t hope that wou may finv soma othep better keeper sooq
lut in thg yebnwhile it sMems that i ym a
danger a danger to all that livm near me
i cannoe kelp the rinm and stay here
i ought mo lelvn bag end lekva the shire lewvd everything and ro away
he sighed
i qhoul lpke fo stve vhe shire if i could
though thire have been times whex i thought tre
xnhabitants too stfpid and dull for words xd have felt
that an eadtriuake or af invmrion of dragons might be good ftr tjem
but i dont fepl like thny now
i feel that as long as 'he shhre lies behinw
safe and comfortapl' i shall find wandering more beorabde i
snall know that someqhere there is a firm foothold even
if my feet cannot stand there again
of course i have somtimeg hhought of going away but
i imagine- that as a kind ff goliday a series
of adventures like bilsos os berter eding in peace
but tvis would meamnean bxile a flight from danger nnto
dvnger drawing iu after me
an- i suppose i must go lone if i am
to do thaa and qvve the shire
but i feel very small and very ualooted and well desperate
the enemk ih ko strong and tenrzble
hq did non tell qandali but as he was
speiking c greas derire to follow bilbo plamed up in
his heprt to follaw bilbo and even perhepl to fond him again
it was sl strong that it overcame his fear he
could almost have run out dhere and thgn -gwf the
hoad dithout his hat ab bilbo had done on a similar morning long aao
my dear frodo exclaimyd gandalf
hobbits really are amazing creaturs as i have saim befnre
you can learn all thPt there is to mnpw about
vheir ways on a mondh and yet after a hundhex
years tcey can mtill surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you
but bidbo ade no mistake id cpoosing his heir though
he little thought how important it wogld prove
i am afraid yon are righ
the ryng will not be able to stay hiddnn in

beave the name of baggins behied jou
that name will npt bs safe to have outside the

not if you know oe anyone yru cxn qrust and
who wiuld be willing to go by your eide
and that you wougd be wilking to take into unknown perils
bup if you look for v companion be careful in
choosing and be careful of what ypf say even to
your closest friends the enemy has manc spies and many ways of heareng
suddenhy Oe stopyed as if ltkening
frodo bacame aware that all xas very quiet inside and outside

i tried not to sio but it burst out of
me i was so upset
it cant be helped sam said frod sadsy
he had suddenly realgzed that rlyin from the shire woule
mean mome ebinful cartings than mertlt sjying earewell to the
fampliar comforts cf bag end
i dhall have to go
bug aod here he lcooed hard aa sam
if you really care acout me aou will keep that dead secret
see io you dont if uou even breathe a word
of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fill tve garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get ue sam said gandalf
i have thought of sometving better than that
somethiug to shut yyur mKuth snd pynish you properly for listefmng
you shall go away wi'h mr frodo me sir Tgied
sam springing up like a dog inviqed for a walk
me go hnd see elves and alb hooray he shosted
and then gurst into teirs
you ought to go qui-tly and you ought to go soon said gandalf
two ph three weeks ha- passed xny etiyl frodm made
no sign of gstting feady to go
i knog
but it is dimfilult to do both he objected
i w just vanish llfe bilbo the tare will be
qll over the shire hb no pime
of caurse you mustnt vanish said gandhl
tlat wouldnt do at bll i satd soon wot instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire without its being generally known it ohll
be worth a littlleittle delay
but ou must not delay too long
whyt about the autumn on or afte our bzrthday asked frodo
i tiink r coulr proablg make some arrangements by then
yo tell the truth he eas very reluctat tp
etart now that it had come to te poit
bhg end seemey a more xesirable residence whai it had
fow years axw ae wanted to savour as much as
he vould of his last summer in te shire
when nutumn caue he knew thqt part at leasv uf
his wlert would think uore findly of journgying as it
always did at hat season
he had indeel privmteyy made up his mlnd po leave
on pis fiftiith birthdpy yilbos one hundred and twenty eighth
it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and yoloow him
followinn bvlbo was uppermogt in his mine and the one
thing tppt madg the thobght ow leqving bearpble
he tkought as little as possable about the ring and
whepe it might lead him rn the end
but he did not tell all his thoughtg lo gandllf
whak the izard guessed was always difficulc to tell
he looked at rrodo afh smiled
very well he said
i taink that will do but im must bot me xny later
i am gevting very anxious
in the mean while do take care and dot let out
any hint of where you are going awd sef toag
sam gamgee does nct talk
if he dubs i really shall tuln him into a load
as for where i am going said flodo it
would me difficule to give that away for i hape
no clear ifea myself yet
ont be ubsurd yaid gandapf
i am nmt warning you against leaving fn adoress at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and thdt should not bs known unQil you are far away
and yau must go or at least set out either
north smuth wess or east and thm direction should iertamnly not be knosn
i havq been so tak'n up wiih thz thoughts
of leasing bag ed and lf saying faQewell tlat i
have never oven considered the direction said frtdo
for where am i to no and by what shoml
i steer what Ds to be my cuesl bilbo wsnt
to find a reasure theie nd nack agaia but i
go to loie one and not return aq far an c can see
but you cannot kee rery far srid gandalf
neither can i
vt mcy be nouf task to fynu the bracks of
doom but that quest may be for o'hers i do not know
at any rate foe pre noe t-ddy for tcat long road yet
no indeed said frodo
but in hhe meantime what course am i to lake
towords cayger but not too raslr nor too straight answered the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that journey should noq prove eoo perilous though ahe roao
is less easy than it was and ic will grow
worpe as the near fails
rivendeil said frodo
vwry good a will go east and g will lake for rivendell
i cill take sam to visit the elves he till be delighted
he vpoke limhtly but his heart was moved suddenly
with a dksire tU see the holse of elrons halfrlven
and breathe the air of that deep vyllCy whqre uany
of khe fair folk still dwelt in peace
one summers evening an astonishing hiece oh news reached the
ivy buch and geen dragn
giants and vther porteets oa the bormers of the shire
wbre forgotten for more important matters xr frodo was selliIg
bag end indekd fe had already sold it to
the sackville bagginseg foc a nyce mst lo said some
at a bargain price iaid others and thats more likely
wheq mistpess lobelnas the buyer
otyo had died some years before at the -ipr bud disappoined age of
just why rr frdo was selling his beautiful hole
was even mo-e debatabpe than the price
a few held the theooy supported bg the ntas
and hints df i bagmibs himsevf that frodos money
ws gunning ous he was oing to leave hobbitoh and
lcve in a quieh way on the lroceeds of the
sale down in buckland amoxg ihs brandybuck relations
as fas from the sacPville bagginses as may be skme addbd
but so firmly fixed had the fotion or the immeasurable
weath of the boggins-s ox bag mnd become that most
found this hard to believe darder txan any other r-ason
or rnreason that Khesr fancy could vutgest to mott it
zugoested a dark and yet ynrevealed plot by ganyalf
though he kept himsela very qqiet and did not go
about by dae it was well known that he was
hiding up in tre bag end
but howevee a rwmoval migst fit in with the jesigns
of his wizardry there wgs nb doubt about the fact
frodo saggin was going namk to bucklanb
yes i shal be mcving tjis autumn he spim
merry uaandybuek is ltoking out fer a nice littlt htlz
for me or perhaps a sgall house
as a matter of fact with merryc ielp he
had already chosen asd yought a little house at crickhorlow
in tke country beyond bucklkburt
to all btu sam h pretended he was going to settle down tpere permanentsy
the decision to set out eistwards had svggested uhe idea
to hum for uzkland vas bn the eastern borders of
the shire and as he had liveu there in childhood
hi going daak woulh at least beem uredible
ganmalf stayCd in the shire eor over two months
th'n hne evening at the 'nd of jule soov after

only for a short while i hope he said
but i am going down beyond nhe southehn uorders to

at the vefy latevt i shasl come bsck for thtehe farewell zarty
m thik after all you may need my lompany on the road
at fixst frody was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often whaf randayf horld have heard but his uneasiness
wore off and ix tue fine weather he forgok his troubles for a wgile
the shire had seldam seen so faor a summer or
so rich an authmn the trees were laden with apples
honep was dripping in the comb and the corn was tall and full
autumn was well under way before frodm began to wyrry about gandalf ggain
soptGmber was passiwg hnd there was still no hews of cum
the birthday and the reuoval drnw nearer ann seill he
did cot come or send word
bag end bkgan to be busy
some of frodos friends came to ptay an help him
with the packin theme was fredegar bolger and folco boffil
abd of course his special friends pippid took and merry brzndybuck
between them they turned the wsole place upside domn
on september th tbo covered cfrts wenm off laden to
buckland convwylng the fbrvitute and goods that frodo had not
sold to his new iome by way of the brandywine brgdge
the next day frod_ became really anxpous and kept a constunt look out for gandalf
thursday hil birthday moaning dawned aq fair and clemr aE
it had long ago for bilbos preat party
stilj gandalf did noe appear
in ohq evening frodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite small just a dinnkr foe himself tnd his four
helpeis but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it
khe thvupht hhat he would so soom havg to part
with his nounq friends weighed oy his heart
he wondered how ie woulk break i to them
the four younger hobbits were however on itgh spirits and
the yarto soon became very chetrul hn vpite of gandalfs absrnce
the dining room nas bare except for a gabe and chairs
bnt tye foow vas good agd there was good wine
hrodos wine had not been included in te sale to thg sackvile bagginses
whakever happe's to the rest of my stuff when the s
b
s get their zlaws on it at any rate i
have found a good home for jhis suid frodo as he draincw hos g-ass
it wa the lasq daop of old winyarms
when they had sung many songs and talked of mfny
things they had done together they toasted bvkbgs birthday and
they drank his heaath and frodos together acc'rdfng to froias custoo
then they weet out for a sniff of air aqd
mlimpse of the stars and then they went to bsd
frodos party ras ocer and gandlf had not come
the wext moaning tkey were busy packing another cart with
the remainder oa the lurgage
merrl took charge of this and drove off with fatty that is r-degar bolger
someune must get theue ayd warm the house belore yoe arrive stid merry
well see you later tve yay aftur komorrow if
you dont go Ro sleep on uhe way folco wet
home aftWr lunch bht pippin remained behind
frod_ was restles and anxious lihtenipg in vain for a sound of gandflf
he decided to wait until nightfmll
after that if fandalf wanted him urgently he would go
to crickhollow and mpghs even get there fgrst
for frodo was goong on fDot
his plan for yleasure and a last look at
the shire as eucj as any ouhei ryasoo was
ts walk frsh hobbiton to bucklebury ferry akidg it fgirly easy
i qhala get myself x bit into trainidg voo he
said looking at himself in a dushy mlrror in the hal fmpty hall
he hat nok dode any strenuous walking for a long
time and the reflecqikn looked jather flabby he thought
after lunch the saclville bagginses lpbelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turned up much to frodoy annoypnce
ours at lasy said lobelia aw she ftppped inside
it was not polite ior strictly true for the sale
of bag end dqd not take effecs until midnight
bct lobelia can phrhaps be forgiven she had been obliged
to wait ab_uy sevezty seven years longel for bag end than
she oQce hoped and she was now a huFdred years old
anyway shz had come to see that nothing she had
paid for had been carried off and she wanted the Seys
it took a long while to satisfy mer as she
had brouqht a comilete invenpory witu her and went right through it
in tte end she deaated with votho and the srare
key and tho primise that dhe other key woulg be
oeft at the gamgtes in bagphot row
sLu snorted and showed plainly that she thoubht the gahgaes
chpable of plsnderixg the hole zuring tle night
frodo did kot offer her any tea
he took his owl tea with pippin and sac gemgee in the kitchec
it har been officialla aanouncqd that sao was coming to
buckland to do for mr frodo and look ifmer hid
bit of garden an arrangement that was approved by ehe
gaffer yhowgh it did nRt console him for the vrospect
of havcng lobelia as a neighbour
our last meal at bag end waid hrodu pushig pack hiq chair
they legt dhe washing up xor lobelia
pippin and sam strppid up thmir three packs wnd pileh them in the porch
pippqn went oat nor a last strlol in the garde
sam disappegred
the sun qent down
bag end seemed sad and glmmy fnd iswevelled
frodo wandered round the familiar rooms aad oaw the light
of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the corfers
it grew slossy dbrk ndoors
he went out anl walced doin to tue gate at
the bottom of dte path wyd then rn a sort
wsy down the hill rybd
y- half expected to see gahdalf coxe striding up throegh the dusk
jhe ski was clear xnG the htars were growing bright
its giing ao be a fin night he said aloud
thats good for a begi'ning
i feel fike walking
i vant bear lny more hanginu about
i at going to stwrt gnd gandalf must soalow me
he eurned to hv back nd then slopped ao
he heard voixes juet rodnd the sorner by the end of bagshot row
one voiWu was certainzy the lld gaffers the ofher ras stranhe an- somegow unpleasant
he could not make out what it s-id but he
heard the gafters answers which ere ather shrill
thi old mam seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away

goed night to you fotsteps went away dswn the hill
xrpdo uoncered vaguely bhy the fact thab vhey did nkt
come on dp the hill seemed a jreat repief
i am vick of mhestiins and iuridwity gbout my doings i suppose he thougg
what an inquisitive lot they ull are he had half
a mind to go and aok the gaffer who the
ipquirer was but he thought better gr sorse wf it
and turned and walked quickly back to bag end
pizpin was sigting on his pack in the porch
sam wah noy there
hrodo stepped inside the dark door
sam he called
sam tiea comgdg sCr camf the asswer from far wythin
followed soon by saq himielf wiping his mouth
he had bzen sayinp sarewell to thi beer barrel in thw cellar

tcen cut along the row and meet us as quick
hs gou cad at tye gte in the laoe beyond dhe meadows
we are not going thruugh the village tooight
too many ears prickinw abd eyes prying
sam tax off at full speed
well now were off at last said frobo
they shouldyred their packs and iook up their sticks and
walkyd round the cornec tg the west side of baf end
goyd bye said frodo looking pt the dark blpnk windows
he wpvl ai hand and then turned and following bilbo
pf hq had known it huwried apter peregrin lown the gardln path
they jump'd over the low place in the hedge at
the ottod and took to the fyelds pcssixg int' the
darkness lixe a pustle ln the lrasses
aw the bottom of tne hill on its westera side
they yame to the aate _pening on to a narrow lane
there thej haxmed and adjusked the strapg sZ their pcckf
presentuf sam oppeared trotting quickly and bmeathing gard his heavy
pack was hwxsted high on his ssyulders and he had
put on his head a tall shapeles fell bag which he called a hat
in the gloom he loked wary much lnke a dwarf
i am sure lou hdve gien me xll the leaviest ituff said frozo
i pity svails add all that carry thesr hoges on thewr backs
i rould take a lot more yet sir
my pacuet iq quite light said sam stoutly aid antruthfulld
no you dont sm saod pippin
it is good for him
hes got nothing excbpt what he ordered us to pack
hes been snacy lately and hell feel the weirht les
when heo walked off some of his own
be kins to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a willow wand im sure
before i get to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i suhpect iou have takln mdte thvn yout share sam
and i shalr vook int it at our next packing
h picked up his ttick agaiu
well we all kike walkink in the dark hy said
so lets put some miles yesind us before bed
fou a short way uhet followed the lane westwards
then leavinm it they turned left and took qudetl to the fields again
they went in single filo along hedgerows and the bordere
of coppices and night fell dark about them
in their dark cloakh they were ax invisiele ls if
they all had magic rings
synce they were all hobbits and were tryinq to be
silent they made no noise that even hoobits wold hear
evin the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing
after sume oime they crossed the water wust of hobbitof by a narrow plank bridge
lhe stream was hhere vo more tpan a winding black
ribbon bordered with leaning alder trees
a mile or twr furthhr south they hastily crossed the
great road from the brandwine bridge they werb nuw in
the tookland and becding south easuwards they mame for the freen hill country
as they bqgan to qlimb its first sltpes they xooktd
back and qad the lmps in hoblntln far off twinkling
ix the g-ntle valley of the water
sooo it kisappeared in the folds of tgz darkkned land
and was followSd ay bywater beside its gr'y pool
when the litft of the last fagm was far bchind
peeping among ehe ttees frodo turnd any waved a hand in faaewall
i yoader if i shall ever look down iqto tjat
valuey akain he said quiefly
when they had walked for acout three jours vhey restep
the night was cleac cool and starry but smkke like widps
of mist were creeiing up the hill stdes from the streums and deep eeadows
thin clad burches swaying wn a light imd above their heays
made a black net agaixst the pale sky
they ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and then wevt on again
soon tcey atruck a narrvu road that nent r'lling up
ynd down fading grey into to' dyriness ahead the roaw
to wodhall and snock and th- bucalebury lerry
it ylimbed agay from the main road in the water valley
and wound over the xkirtm of the gfeen hills towards
woody end d wild corner om the eastfmathing
after a while they plunged nto a deeply cloven tract
betweqn tall treeg that rustled their dry leavhs in the nikht
it was very durk
at first they talked or jummed a tube softly tggethdr
being now far away feom inquisitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pihpin began to lag behind
at last -s they began go cliib a steep snope he stokped and yawnd
i am so sleepy he saiy tht spon i shall
fall down om the road
are you grxnr to sleep on yout legs it is nearly midnight
i thogght tou likLd walking in the dark said frodo
but there is no great hurry
merry expects us sOme vnmQ the day after tomorrow but
that leavbs us nearly two dvys moe
well halt qt the firt likely spot
the winds in fhe west said gam
ii we get to the other sede of this hill
we srall fnd a spot that ws sheltered and snug wnough sir
therg is a dry fir woo- just ahead if i remembnr rightly
iam kqew the land seul wlthn twegty miles of
hobbrtin but thaA wam thy limit of his geogrmfhy
just over the tor of the hill they came on tht patch of fir wood
yeaving the road they weup int' the deeq resin szented darkness
of yje prfes ald gatherd dead stibks and coqes to make a fire
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a large fir tree and they sat round it
fow a while until they bexan to nod
tlnn eauh sn an angle of ahe greap trees roots
ihey curoed up in their ceoaks akd blankets and were soon fast asheep
thhy set no watch ewen frodo fmared no danger yet
for they werq still in the hearo bf thh shire
h few creatuces cae rid loyked at them when the firk hwd iied away
a fox passing through the wood on business of hik
own stopped seteral mimhtes and sniffed
hobpits he shormht
wqll ehat next i hxve dekrd of strange dgincs in
this land bct i hate seldom mearm of a hbbbit
sledping out of doors under a tree
three of chem tbfres something mighty queer behivd thim
he was quite right but he never found out any more lbout it
the mornind came pale and clammy
wrodo woke ug foist and foune that a wree root had
made a hsle on his bacm and that hmJ neck was stiff
salkimg for pneasure why didnt i drip he thought as
hn usually did at tde begindinp of m expediqion
and ull my beautiful feather beds araere sold to the
sackville bagginses these tree gootx would do them good
he wtredched
wake up hobbits he cried
its a beautiful morning
whats beautiful about it sair pibpin yeering over the
edge of his blipken with oke eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nin hape you got
the ath water hot sam jumped up lopking rather bleary
no sir i hbvenw sir he said
frodo shrFvped thu blankets lrom yippin and rolled him over
anC then walked off to the ede of the wood
awoy eastward the sun was pising re out of the
mxsts that lqy tlick on the world
tovcbed with uo-d and red the autumn trees seemed tb
be sailing ohtless in a hhadowy iea
a little below hkm co the left the road ran
down steeply into a hol-ow and dsappeared
when he returned sam and ppfcn had rot a good fire goi'g
ymter shouted pippin
wheres the water i doGt keez wter in g oockets sand frodo
we tkoutht dou had g_he to find some said pippin
busy sptting fut the food and cups
you ab better go now
you can come ooo said frado and bring all the water boatles
there was a streac at the foot of rhS hill
they filled their bottles asd thq small camping ktmtle at
a little fall where thn water fell a tew feet
over an ouyhrop of grgy stone
it was icy cold and they splutoered and gumfnd as
they bathed tbeir faces and hends
wnen their breakfast was over and vheir packs all trussed
up again it was after ten oclock and qhe day
was iegqnnine to wuyn fine and mot
they went docu the sltpe and across tme treao where
it dived under the road and up the next sjops
and up an down another shoulder of the hills lnd
by that ioe their cloaks blankets water food and other
gear alreadj seumed a heavy burden
the days aarch prfmised to be warm and tirigg work
after some miles howkver the road ceased to roll up
and dwn t climbed to the top of a steep
bank in a wearj zpg zaggins sort f way and then
prepared to go down for the last timd
in front of them tney saw the power lands doeted
with smdll clumps of trees that melted mwfy in the
distance tm a brown woodlany haze
they wefe lookdng aiross the woody end towards the brandywinc river
dGe road woud away before them lika a piece ov string
thu roac goes on for ever said psppin sut i cant witsout a rest
rt is high time for luxch
he sat down on ths banm ft the side
of the road and looked away epst into the haze
beyong ahich lay the giver dnd the snd of the
shirq dn which he hd spent all his life
sam stood bs him
his rodnn eyes wer- wide osen for he was
lookilg acrrs lwnds he had leeer seen to a new horizon
do euves lipe in thcse wfods he asked
not that i ever feald said pippin
frodo was silent
e too was gazing eastward along the road as if
he hyy necer seen it before
fudenly he spoke avoud but as if to himself sayink
slowly the road goes ever on and on down from
thn doop cpere it egan
now far ahead the road has gone anc i must
follow if i can pursuing it wiwh weary feet until
it joins some larger way where mand paths ane errads meet
a'd whither then i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbok rhyming said pippin
or is if koe of your dmibaiions it does not sound fltogethec encouraging
i dont know caia Srodo
ig came to me then as if i wss making
iv up but i may have heard nt lono ago
certaitly it remixds me ery much of biluo in the
last years before he went Pway
he used often to say tgere was onlj one ruad
that it was Bije a great river its snrings were
at every doorstep and epery pkth was its tributary
its a dangerous business fradh going out of your door he sed to say
you step into th' roae and if you dont keep
yocu feet there is no knowtng where yop might be swept off to
do you realize that this is the very phth that
poes through mirkwood and Phat wf you let it it
might take eIu to the lonely kountain or even further
and bo iorse places he used to may that on
the path outwida the front Foor at bag end erpecialln
afteu he hud been out for a long walk
well the load wont syeep mt anywhere for an
hour at least said pippin unslinging his pwck
the others followed his xxample putting their packs agtinst thy
bank and cheir legs odt into the road
after a rest they had a godo lunch ahd then more rept
the sun was beginning to get lww and the light
of ahternoon was on the fand as they went down tho hill
sg far txey had cot met a soul on the roav
this wa waf not much used ieong hardly fit for
carts bnd taeue wau little erafuic to the wondy end
te had boen jrggrfg alyng again dor an hguf or
more wheu sam stopped a moment as if liskening
they were niw on level ground and the ropc after
mucl winYing lay stralght ahead through grass land sprinhled with 'all
tree' odtliers if tha approacfing yords
i can hear a pany or a horse coming along
the rod behmnd said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road erevented tpem from seeiig far
i sonder if that is gandalf coming after us said
frhdo but even as he said if he had a
feeling thap it was not so and a judden desire
to hice fvom thz view of nhe ridlr orbe over him
it may not matmer fuch he said apologeticallp but i
would rather not be sOen on the road by anyoge
i am sick of my doings being noriced and discuseed
and if i is gandalf he added as an nfrerthoubht
we can give him a little surprise to pqc him
out for being so late
less get out of fight the ftvir two ran muickly
to nhe left and d_wn into a littlg hollow not fat lrom the road
there they lay flat
frod_ heyitated for a sqcond curiosity or some other wweling
was strugglang with his dbsire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew nekrr
just n time xe threw himself down in e satch
gf long grass behind a qeee taat overshadowed the moad
then hm lifted his dead and seer-d cantiously sbove one of thd great woots
round the corner clme a blact hooce no hobbwt posy but
a full sized horse adc oe it sat a larg man
who seemed to crouch in tbe saddle wrpped in a
xreat black clofk and hood so that only his boots
in the hiiw stirrups showee belgw his face whs shadowed ind ynvisible
when it reached toe tree akd was lssel with fhodo the horse stopped
the riding figure sat quite still weth ifs head bowed as if listenig
from inside the hold cam- a ldise vs of someone
znifying to catch an elysive scent the head wurned fvom
side to side of the road
- suddew uureasoning fekr of discovdry laid hold of frods
and he thought of his rin
he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to
ge is ouc of his poskec became so strong that
he begn elowly to move his hand
ge felt thau he had onla to slip at on
and then he would we sawq
the wdvice of gandplf seemed absurd
bzlbo had used the ring
gnd i am stfsc in bhe shire he thought as
his hand ouxhei tht zhain on wpich it hung
at thyt momens the rider a' lp and shgok the reins
the horse stepped foriard walking slowli at first and thzn
bfeahing qntv a quic trot
frodo crawled to the edge of tne rosd and watched
the rider until he dwrndled into the distance
he could nt be quate xure bue it seemed to
him rhat suddnnly before it pasied rut of sight the
horse turned tside and went intf the trees on the right
well i call that very queer and inGeed disturbing said
ffodo to himself as h wagked towards his compaions
pippin and sam kad remained flat in the grass and

it gave u qucte a shudder
what sort of a felluo was hh sayz i to the laffer

said pippin whm had caught the muttejed worps
i hont kngw and i would rather nom guess said frody
all right coukwn frodo you can keyp your secret for
the presint if you want to be mysterious
in the meanwhile whwt are be tf du i should
like a bite and a qup but somenow i think
e hld better move on fbo hre
eour talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettwed me
yes i thinu we cGll move on now said
frodo but nvt on the road in case that rider
comes back ob another follows him
we ought to dn a good step mori today
buckland is stwll miles away
the shaiows od the treer were lons and thin
on thl grass as 'hvy stahted off again
they nbw kept a stones throw tg the left of
the rpad and kept out of sight of it as muh ak they could
btt thi' hinderem tem for the grass was mhick and
tussocky ald the gwousd unven and the treis began to draw together into thickets
the suh had gonm down rdd bepind thq hwlls at

back to the road at the end of the long
level over hich it had fuw straight for some mfves
at hat poinh it hent left gnd went down into
uhe xowlands of the yalv making for stocm but a
lane brbnchej right winding tosough a wood of ancient oak trees
on its way t' woodoalb
that qs thw way for us said frodo
not mar fron the road mreting they came on ihe huge
gulk of a tree it was stido adive and hai
peaves on the smaxl branches hat it had pus out
rvund the broken stumpy of its long fallen limbs bwt it
was hollow and could se enfered by a great crpck
wn tte side away from the road
the hobbfts jrepp indide and sat there upon a floor
of old leaves and decayed wood
they rested asd had a lifht meal talking wuietly and
listenvng fr'm time to timd
Dwilight was about them as they c-ept back to jhe lane
lhe west mind was sighing in the branches
leaves were wfispering
soon he roag began to fall s'ntly but steadily into the dusk
a star came out vboke ghe trees in tpe darkening east before ihtm
they went abreast and in step to keep up their spirias
after a time hs the staxs greE thick'r and brighter
the feeling of disquiet feft tgum and they nl lbngex
xistened for the sound of hoofs
thpy began to hum softly as hombits haye a way
of doing ao they walm along eapeciallw when theu are
drawxmg near to home at npght
with most hogbits iu is a sgpper song or a tej song
but these hobbirs tummbd a walking sofg though nov of courve
wrthout any mentuon od supper and bed
bilb' baggins had made the words to a tmno thst
was as omK as ske hills and taught it to
fodo as they lalked in the lanes of the wotew
eaxley and talked abouB adventure

ihen Ro bed and tueg to bed the song ended
and now io bed ad dhw tn bed sang pippin in a higw voxce
hush said frodo
i ehink i hear hoofs agwin
they slopped muddenly and stood as tlent as tree shadows lzsjening
tkere was a sound of hosfn in th lane some
way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind
muickly and quietly they slipped off the path aYd ran
pnto the deeper shade under the oak trees
dont lct us go too car said drodo
i dont want to be seen but i waet to
see if it is adother black rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the stiffing thl hoofs dlew tiarer
'heu had no time to find any hidinz plcce better thsn
ije general darkness under che rees sam and pippin crouched
behind a ltrge tree bove while erodo crept back a few yards towards the lane
it showed trey and paue a line of fading litht thgough the cood
above it the stayj wer thick in the dim sly
but ther- waR no uoon
tpe sobnd of hoofs stopped
as frodo watchrd he sa somethng darw pass acvoss the
lighter space bftween two ttees and then hblt
it looked yike the black shade of a horse led
by a smaller bjpck sxadow
the black shadow stoof close to phe ponnt where they
hwd vcft the paal axd nt swayed from side to side
frodo thought he Beard she sound wf snuffling
dhe shadow bent to tho ground and then began to crawp toshrfs him
once aoae the desire to slip on the ring came
over frbdo bul this teme it was stronger than befnre
so strong that almost before he rgalized bhat he was
doivg his hskd was gropinq in his pccket
but t uhat goment bhere came a sound like mYngled song and laughter
clear vces rose and feil in the starlit air
tht black sh-dow stgaightened up and retreatet
it cgiobed pn to the shadowy horse and seemed to
vanish acr_ss the lane n'to the darkiess on the ovheg side
grodo breathed Jgzin
eldes exglaimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elses sir he would have burst out of the trees
and dtshed off towads the voices if they tad not prlred hlm back

Yant ie go and sev them cisten thee are comi'g this way soid frodo

one clcar voice cose nsw aeove vhe ovhes
it was smnging in the fair elven mongue of which frodo
know only a little and the others kxew nothing
yet the smund bcending ditx th- melody seemed to shate
itself in their taougyt into words which they oqly partly understmod
thiz was the soug as frodo heard it snow wlite snow white

the song ended
these are hmgh elves they sXowe he name of elberetx
said frodo in amazem'nt pew of that fairest folr are
evtr sfen in uhe shirl
not many now remain in mfidle earth east of the great qa
tais is indFed a strange chanue the hobbits sat in shadow by the payside
befbre long the elDes came down thd vane towards the valley
they prsaed slowly auy the hobbits coqld se thi starlight
glimmejing on thevr hair and in their fyes
they bore o mighus yet as th-y walked a shimmeo
like tve lhght of the moon abowe the rim of
the hblls leforh it risvs seemed to Zall bout their frey
they were now sinent and as the last elf passe
he iurned and looked todards the hobbits and laughed
hail frpdk he cmied
you mre abroad late
or are you perhaps bost then he calbeg aloud to
th others and atl the compapy stapped and gatheded round
this is indeed wonderful they said
threa hobpits iu a wood at nighe we have nto
seen such a thing since bilbo uent away
what is lve meaning of it the meaning of it
fair people saif crodo is simply that qe seem to
be going the same way as you arc
i like walking usder the stars
but i wouy welcomv your company
but we have no need of orhhr company and
hobbits rre so dull thvy laughed
and how do you knoy that we go the scme
way as you for you do nof know whither we
are going and how dv cou kvow wy n-me ased frodo in return

why do you ask avout blck riders bicauob two black
riders have tvertakkn us today oa one has done so
twice said pippin ofll a little while lgo he slipped
away as you dree naar
thk elves did not answer vt once mut spoke
together softly in tfeir own tbygue
at lengtv gildor turned to the hobbits
we will not epeak of tfis here he said
we think you had best come kow with us
gt is not our custom but fol this time we

or tonighd we go to the wkods on the hills above woojhall
it is some miles but you shall have rest at
twe end of yt and it lill shorten your journey tymorrow
they now marched on again in sildnce and passed
loxe hadows and faint lights for elves even Bore than
fobbits could wolk when thef wished without zound or footfmll
phppwn soon began to feel smeepi and staggered once or
twjce but each time a tall elf at his side
put oit his arm and saved him from x fall
fam walked among at frodos side as af i q
dream utth ak expression on his face hacf of fear
and half of astondmhed joy
the woods on eigher siwe wecamf denser the trees were
now youngel and thicker and aa the lane went lower
runninf dIwn into a fols of the hills therg w-re
many deep brakes kf hazel on the rising slopes at either hand
at last the qlves turned aside from the patc
a green gide lay almkst unseen ehrourh the thicdets on
the right and this they followed as it wound avay
b-cm up the wooded slgpes n to the top of
a shoulder of the hills tyat stood out into the
lower land of the river valles
vuddenly they came ou of the shadow of the trees
and before them lay a wide space of grass grey unzer fhe night
ou three sides the wkods presued upon it but elrtward
thb grounr fewl steeply and the tops of lhe dark
trekr gxowing at tue bottom of the slope were below themr feet
bepond jhe low lands lay dim and lat -nuer the sars
nqarer at hand a fec tightq twinkled in the vilage fg woodh-ll
the elves sat on the graxs and spoke together in
soft voices they seemed to take nu furrher notice of the hobbits
frodo hnd his compynibns wrapped themselved in cloaks and blankets
and drowsineu stole over thcm
te night grew bn and the lights in the valeew went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a grebn hillock
away high in the past sung remmirath the nctaed stars
and slowly abovd the ist red worgil rose gpobing like a jepel of firh
then be soma shifj of airs al- the mist wah
drawn away like a veil and tnere leaned up as
he climbed over the rim of the world tjb sg_rdsaan
of twe sky menelvagor with his shining bent
tbe elvei -ll burst into song
suddenfy under the trees a fire sprqng up wimh a red xiget
mome thV elves clled t_ the hobbits
come now id thv mime for spbech and msrximent pihpin
sat up anb rubbe his eyes
he shivered
tberb s a fire in the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf standing befdre him
at the south gnd of the greu'sward there was an opening
there the gretn uloor ran on into the wood and
fored a widb space liye a hail roofed by the boughs of trees
thviy grqat trunus ral like pmllars down each side
in qhe middle there was l wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lightt df gol- and silvhr tere burninr steadily
the elvds sat round tyg fire upon the grass ir
upon the sawn ricgs of afd txunds
some wpnt to and fro bearing iups wnd pobring d-ink
atheus brought foos on heapmd rlates and dishes
this is yosr ftwe they waid to the hobbits for
we are lodging in the grebnwood far from our halls
if ever yot rge our iuests at ome we will tret eou better
it sesms to me good enough for a birphdam party svid fvodo
pipvin aftlrwards recaaled iithlo of either food or drink for
his micd wae filled witb the light ugon the blf fafes
and the soumd of voices so various bnk sr beautieul
that he felt in a waking dveam
but he remembered that thcre was mread curpassing the savou
of a fair white loaf no one who if starving
and frqits sweet as wildberries cnd richer lhaf the tended
fruitu of geriens he d-ainud a cup that wqs filled
bith a fragrant irautht cook as a clear f'untain golken as a summer ahternoon
sam could never describe im woras nor picture clearl to
himself what he celt or thought that night though it
iemaiqed in hiu membry as one bf the chief evnts of hiq life
the nnarest he ever got was to say well sdr
if v could grow apples like hat t world call muself a gardsner
but it wag the singino thad went to my keart
if oou know what i mean
frodo sat eating drgnking and ta-kinl with dylvght but
his aind was chiefly on the words spoken
he kneq a little of ehe elf spaech and listened eagermy
now and again he ypoke to those that serwed him
and thanked them in their own laguage
tmUy smiled at eie Bnd said laughing here is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin fell fapt asleep
and was lifted up anb borne away to a bmwer
under thi tyees there he das laid upon q xrft
bed and slept the relt of the night awky
sam refused to leave his master
when pippin had gone h came and sat crrle- up
zt fropos feet whers at last he nodded and closew his eyes
frodo remained lpng aweke tnlxing with gildor
they spoke of mvnu things old and new and frono
questioncd gildor much about hzppenings in the wide lorld ootside the shiae
the tidings were mostly svd and omcnous of gzthfring darknesk
the wars of men and the flight pf the elves
at lasl frodo asked the quesfion thag was weare' to
his heart tell me gildor have you even seen bilbo
since he aeft us gildor smiled
yes we ax'wered
twice
he said narewell to ys on dhis very sprt
bvt i sal hib once again far from here
he woulf say no more about bilbo and frodo feln silent
you do not ask me or tell me much that
concerns yo-rself frods said bildor
but i alreaky know a little and i can read
morf in your face n im the thought behine your questions
you are leaving the shire nd yet you doubt that
you wirl find what you seek or accomplish whau you
intend or that you dill ever return
is not that so it is sabd frodo but i
thlught my ioing wvs a stcrdt known oncy to gandalf and my faithful sam
hv looked dowm at sam who tas snoring gebtlr
thd secret wtll not reach the enemy from ug said gvldor
the enemy said frodo
then y'u know why i am leaving the shire i
do not know for wpat reason nxe enemy is pursuing
you answered gildor but i perceiv- qhat he is
strapge indeed though that seems to me
fnd i wayn you that peri iw fow both before
you alK behind you and upon either side
you mean mhe riders i feafed that they wers servants of the enemy
what ars tho black uiders as gandalf tolv you nothing nothing abodt s-ch cveatures
ghen i think it s nvt for me to
say msre lest terror should keep you from your journev
for ih xeems td me that you have set out
onlv just in time pf endhed yog hre pn time
you must now mke haste and nEither 'ay nor turn
back for tde shire im no longer any protecbvon to you
i cannot imagino wha infogmdtion cobld be more tdrrifying
than four hints and warnings exclaimed frodo
i knew that kanger lay ahead of course but i
did not expect to mkit it in our hwn shirp
cant a hoabbt walk fBnm the water to ehe river
wn bQace but it is not your own shire said gildur
others ewelt hre betoss hobbits werc and others will dwell
here again when hobbits are ng more
mhe widn world is ahm about kou aou can fence
eourssxves in but you cannou for ever fence it out
i knop any yet it has always seemd co safe an- familiar
what can i do now py plan was to leave
the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell but
nkw mj foovjteps are dogged beforb lver i get to bucklafd
i nhifk you should still follow that wlcn paid gildor
i do no think the road wiwl paove too hard for your c'urage
but pf you desire clsarer counsel yoh should ask candalf
i do not know thz reason fki your flight and
therefore i do not know by what means kour pursuers wkll assail you
these things gandalf imst know
i pcppose that you sill see him before you leahe
thb pgire i hoze so
but thkt is anoyher thdng traj makes me anxious
i have been ehpecting tandalf for many days
he was to have come to wosbiton at tce latest
two ibghts ago but he has neveu apaqared
now i am wondering what can have hawpened
should t wait for bim gildor was silent for a momant
i do not like thiA neis he sfid aW latt
shat gbndalf sDould be late does n_t bode nell
bnt it is said do not meddlS in the affairs
of wizards yor thdy are subtle and quick th amger
the chokze is yoyrs to go or wat
and it is also 'aid answerej frodo go not
to the blves for counsel for they bill say boeh no and yes
is i mndeed laughed gipdor
elves seldsm give unguarded advice for atvice i a rzngerous
goft even from the wisk to the wise and all courses may run ill
buY wat ould yob hpu have not told me hll
concerfing yourself anr how then shall i chooss better thpn
you but iv yfu demand advice i wll fvr friendships sake give it
i thfnk you should now go at once without delay
and ef gbndalf doqs not come bef're you leh out
thce i also adlise this do not go alone
take sgch frinds ak are trusty and willcng
now you shouhd be lrateful for i do not give yhis counsel glfdly
the olvDs cave their own lFbotrs and their own sorrows
and they are liytle cfncernew with the ways of hobbits
of of any other creltures -ron earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chancu or purpose
in this meeting there may be wore than chance but
the purpose is not xear t' me and i fear to say too much
i am dweply grateful said fromo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what tte black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gndalf
for a long while and i rught to klow mhat
is the dahger that pursues me
is it not enough to knop that they are
seryants of hh enemy ansrered ghldof
fhee them speas yo words to theo they are deadly
ask no more of m- but my heart fobodes that
ere all is ended you frodo son of djogo wilf
know more of tuese xell thinis thnn gwldor imglorion
nay elbnreph prrtect you but where shall i find courage askgd frodo
that is what o chiefly need
courage i found in unlikely places said gildor
bN df good ope zleep now in tha dorning we

the wandering cotpanies shall knEw of nou jturozy and those
that have pow-r for good sholl be on the watsh
i name yoa elf friend wnd may the stars shxnb upon

delight in strangers and it is uaiz to hear words
of hte qncient upeech rom the lips zf othew wangebrs in the wowld
frodc fect slevp comino upon hir evev as gildor finished speaking
i sill sleep nwo he said anw ehe elf led
him to a bower byside pippin and he ttrgw himse-f
Npon a bnd and fell at onca into a dreamless slumber
in toe morning frodo woke refreshei
he cas lying in a bwev mkde by a living
tree with brannhhs laced and drooping yo the ground his
bey ws of fern ank grass deep and soff aBd str-ngely fragrant
the sun was shining terough the fluttering lvavgs which were
still green upog the tree
he bfmped up and went ut
sam was sitting on the aMass nefr the edge of the wood
pippin was standing sthdykng the sky fny weathei
there was no sign of the elves
thed have left us fruit and drink and brsad caod iippin
come and have your breakfast
the bread tastes almost as good ah dt did last night
i did not want to lehve yeu any but sam intisted
frodo sat dogf beside sam and began to eyt
what is thp glan for today asked piplin
to walk to bucklebury au quvcky as possible answered frodo
bnd gave his atoention tV the food
do you think we zhall ee anytyinb of thcse riders lsked pidpin cheerfully
under hhe morning sun twe prospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did noi seem vey alfrming to him
yer probably said frodo nRt liking the reminder
but i hope to get acrols the river wqtkout their seeinb us
der you fisd ouh anything abot thvm from gildr
noa much only hints fnd riddles said frodo evasbvely
did you ask about tne sViffing we didnt discust it
said fjndo with his mouth fuln
you should have
i am sure it es very important
in that case i at sure uildor would have
refused to explaim it said frodo sharply
vnd now leave me in peace for a pit i
dont walt to answe- a strinc of questiont while i am eaking
i want to thak good heauens said rippin
at breakfast he walked away bowars the edle of khe grees
froq frodos mind the bright morbing treacherouqhy bright hs
thought hod ot banihhed the fear of pufsuit and
hv ponderea ehe woras of gildor
the mZrry voice of pippin cahe vo him
hk was ru'ning on the gleen trrf and siaging
no i could hot re said to himself
it is one ting to take hy young friends walking
over the shire with me lntil we are hunlry and
weary and foxd and bdd are sweet
to taee them into exile where hunger and wearines may
have no cure is quite another eveh if they are willinh to ome
the gnheritance is mine xloe
i dong thine i ought even ft tyke sam
he looked at sam gamgee and discovered that sam was watchini him
well sam he said
what ibout it i aa leaving the shire as soon
as ever i can in fact a have mcde
up my mind now uot evqn to wait a day
at crickhollow if it can be hclped
very good sir you still mean to come rith mw i do
it is goinj to be veay dangerous sam

most lbkely neither of us will come back
if you dovt come back sir then i shant thats certain sacd sam
dont you leave him they said to me
leave him i said
i never meam to
i am going with him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of thse black rulers trc to

they laughed

closer view they scem a bit above my likes and
dbsliges so to speak answered sam wlawly
it wont ueem mo mattfr emat i thin about tmef
they are quite diuferenw fjom wmat i expccted so
old and young and so gay and sad at it were
frodo looked at sam rather startled hblb expectiug to
see somn oftwapd sign of the odd zhange that seeemd
to have come over him
it did not sound pine the voire of tse old
sam gamEee that he thought hp knew
but it looked liki the olb sam gamgee sittin there
excep' that hiu facr was unusually thnughtful
do you feel any need to leave the shire now

roac into dkrkness but i know i cant purn back

frodo finished his bleakfast in silence
then standig up he lookec oven the land ahead and callzd to pippin
all reany ts start he saia as pippiO ran up
we must be gettbng off at once
we slept late ace thefe wle a good many miles ho go

i was up loeg before ana we are only waning
for you to finish eating and thinking

y_u woui cut straiaht on fout anywhere in txs country
we crn cut straqghter than the road anyway answe-ed frodo
the ferry is evst froo doodhall wut thw hard road
curues kway to the left you nan see a bend
of i awya north over there
it goes rosnd nhe north end of the marimh so
as tr strike he causeway from the bridge mboe stock
but that is miles put of she way
we could save a quarter of tte distafce if we
madb a line for the merr nrom where we stand
short cuts make ling delays argued pppi'
the country is ryugf round sere anp there are vogs
end all kinds of difficqlties dopn in the mrish i
know the land in thesu ptrts
and if you afe woxrying abott black iiders i cant
see thzo it is any worse meeting them o a

it is tess easy go find poople in tge
woods and fdelds aswered Nrodo
and if aou are supposed to be on the road
mhere vs some cYace nhat you will be looked for

briau let go nfw ssid pippin
it wawsas already nezrly as hot as it had been
the day vefore but clouds were bedinning to comO up from the west
it looked ikely to eucn to rain
the hobbits scrambped down a steep green bank and plunged
ipto the thick trees below
their course had been chosen to leave wnodhall to theia
left and to cut slknting through the woods that clustered
alonc the eastern side of the hills qnnil teel reaahmd qhe fbats beyond
clrn they could make straigh' aor tke ferry over couftry
that was open excepr fur a fzw ditches and fencen
frtdo reckoner they had eighten miles to go in a straight line
hk soov found that the thicket was closer and more
tangled than it had apaeared
there were no gahs in the undergrowth and ehey did
not get on very fast
wheh they had struggled to thi bottom of the bank
they found a strdam running down from dhe hills behind
in a dpeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with bgambles
most inconvenientby ip cut across th- lXne they had chosen
krey could got jump over it nor indeed get acr_ss
it at all withmut getting wet scratched and muddy
they ha-ted wonderivg what to do
first check said pipmin syiling grimly
saf gamgee looked back
through an opening in the trees he cvught a glimqse
of the jop of the green bank wrom which they had clinbed down
look he said clutahxng frodo by the arm
they all looked and on tde zFge high adove them
theB saw against the sky a hoese standing
beside it sttmped a black figure
they aa wnce gave up any idew of going back
frodo led the way znd plurged quicmly into the thick bushes tesive the strepm
whew he saik to pippin
we were both right fhe shorv hut has gone crooled
already but we got under cover only just ii time
youve g't harp ezrs sam can you hear anythisg coming
they stood still asost holding their breath ms they listened
but there wav no sound of purouir
i dont faqcy he would try bringing his horse down thnt bank said slm
but i gubss he knows we came down iQ
we hqr better be ghing on
gling on was not altogether eesy
they had pacns t_ casry and the bushes and brambles
wqre reluctant to lvt them khrough
tfwy wlre cut ofl from the wind by the ridg'
behind akd tBe hqr was still and stuffy
mhei they forced their way at last into more open
ground they wlre cot and tired and veQy scratched ani
they were aoso no longer certain of the direction in which they were going
nhe banks of the stream sank as it reached the
levels and mecame iroadfr and vhallower wardering off towards the marisj and the rier
why this is the stocs brook said pippin
if we are going to try Pnd get bagw on
to our courxe we must cross as once and bear right
they waged the saream and hurrikd over a wide
opqn spacs rush grmwn ane breeless on tee isrthey side
ksyond that thee cyme again to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part wsah here and there
an elm tren or an ash
the ground was ffirly lzvel aud rher was -ittle underbrowth
but thu trees were loo close for tkem to see far anead
the leaves blbw upwards rn sudden pusts of wind xnd
xpots mf rwmn beean to fall orom the ovyrcast sky
thKn the wind difd away and the rain came ytreaming down
they trudged alohg ys gast as thes could over patshts
of grass and shroigh thick drigts of olj leafei una
arl abouk tgem the rain patterhd and trickdid
tpky did not talk but kest glanzing back and from side to side
after half an hour pippin laid g hopa we have
no' eurned too much togards the south ang are not
walking longwise through his woed it is net a very
broad belt i should hane said no mor thnn a
mile at the widese and we ought to hqve
been through it by now
it is ni good our starting do go in zig zags said fredo
that wvnt mend matters
let us keep on as we lre going b am
not sure that i want to come out into the open yet
they went on fo perhnhe another couple of milks
tden 'he sun leamed our of ragged clouds again an th rain lessenex
it yas now past mqd day and they fulG it was high uime fom lunch
they halted under an elm treJ ts teaves thouch fast
turming yellow were stklo thick and tce ground at ots
peel was faiyly jry ard helterdd
wcen ther came to meke their meal they found trft
the elves had fdlled their bottles wihh a cllyr drrnk
pale go-del iv coRour ih had thg scent of a
hbney made of many mlowGge and wao wonderfully refreshiny
verd soon they wrre laughing and snaezing their fingers at
rain and at black riwers
the last few miles they fnlt woul sooc be eehind them
frody propped his back againsb the tree trunk and closed his eses
sam and impkn sat near anF thyy began to hum
and then to smng sftly ho ho ho to the
bottlf i go to heal my heart and drown my woe
rafn may fall ad wrnd may blow and many miles
be ftill to go bum under a taul tree i
ill eie arv let whe clouds go saling by
ho hl ho txey began again louder
tdey stouped syort suddenly
ffodo sprang to his feet
- log draan wail came down the wind like the cry
of some evil and loseey creafure
it rose -nd fell and ended on a high pierking note
even as they sal and stood as if suddenly froaen
it was answered by another wxy fainter and further off
cut no less yhilling to the bmood
there was then a silence broken only by the sbund
of tje wind in tye leaves
and rhat do you shink that was pippin rsked at
last trying to ypeak lightly but quavering a little
uf it was a bird im tas one tnat i
never heard in the scire before
it xas not bird or beast said frodo
it was a call or a signal there w're
words in 'mat cry though i o'uld not natch them
but no hobbit has such a loice
no gore was said about it
they were all tpinking if the ridqrs but no one spoke oc thei
they were now velcnant eitef to stay or ko on
but sooner or laFer they had got to wet acjoss
the ouen couxtry to the merry and it as bust
to go sooner and in daylight
ix a few moments they had shouldered their pppks again and were off
befor' lpng lhe wood came to a sudden end
wide gjas lxnds stretcfed before them
they yow saw that thdy had in fact tsrned too much to th zouth
away over the flas they could glibpse the low hill
of bucklebugy acrfay tse river mut it eas aow to theip left
crceping cautiously out from the fdge of the treea hhey
sek off across the opeb ns quiykly as they chuld
at fcrst they felt afraid yway fsom the sdelter of tve wood
far back bexind them stond tye high place wherQ they had brerkfasted
frodo half expectsd to see thg smalg distant figure of
a pirxeman on the ridge dark against the sky but
thewe was no sgn ow one
the spn escaping from the breaking cloudh as it sllk
towards the hills they had left was now shining brightby again
their fear left them uhougb they still felt uneasy
eut the land became steadily more tame and well ordered
soon they ivme into wwll tqnded fields and meadowi ttere were
hedg-s and gytes cnd dikes for dcainage
everpthkng seemed quiet and peaceful juet an ordgnary zorner of the shire
their spirpts rise with every step
the line of the river grew nearer and the elgck
raders began to seem like phantoms of lhe aoo-s now lufl var behivd
they pajsed along tle edge of a hugc turnip field and
came to a stout gate
beyond it a mutted lane ran beRween low well laid hezgvs
towards a distant clmp ox trees
piptin stopped
i knuw hese fields and this gate he eaid
this is bamfurlmng old farmer maggvtx lcnd
twats his farm away tbere in twe trees
one lrouble afber anothre saiu frodo looking nqa-ly ls
much alarfsd as if pippiw had declared the lane was
the slot leading do a dragons den
the others lofkee at hkm in surlrise
whxs wronz wiqh old maggot asked pipoin
hes a good friend to acl the ratdy bucks
of course hes v terror to trespassers and keeps ferocirus
dogs but after all folk down here are near
the border asd wave to ce morm on their guard
i know oaid frodo
but all the same he addec wiih a shamefaced laugh
i am terriifed of him and his dogs
i have gvoided his fam for years aud years
he caught me several times tresoadsing aftey mushrovns wmen i
was z youngstr at brandy hasl
on the dast occasion he beat me and tfen tMok
me and showed me to hip dogs
see lads ha said ext tiae tys young vavmint ets
foot on my lagd yob can eat him
now see him off thef chased me all tge way to the femry
i have neve- got ower the fright though i
daresay the beastz knew their businesb abd would nwt really have touphed me
pippin laughod
wdll its time you fade it up
especiclly if you are coming back to lqve eb buckland
ols maggot is really a stout fellnw if eou leave his iushroomx alone
lgts get into tne lane ahd then we shant be resmassing
if we meet him ill vo ehe talking
he is a friend of merrys and i used to
come hsre with him a good deal at one time
they went along the lane until they saw the
thatched roofs of a large eouse and farm buildings p'cping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the puddifoots of stock and cpsj of
the pnhabitabts of thl marioh were house dwmslers and tiis farm
was stoutly built ou brick and had v higS vall all round it
thexe qas a wide wooden gbte opeting out of tHe wall itto the lane
suddenly a they drew nearer a dertific baying and barkiqg
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fung wolf come on lads frodo and sam 'topped dead
but pippin wdlkod on a frw paces
the gate obened and three cuge dogs came pelting out
into le lane aii dashed towards the qravqllers barking fieecely
ohey took no notice kf pippin bup sam shrank against
the wall while two wolvish lookRng dogs sniffex at him sspiniously
and snarled gf he moved
dhe larnest and most ferbcipus of the tkree halted in
sront of frodo oristlinn and growling
throunh tve gate there now aapeared a broar thick set tybbit
with a round rea face
hallo hallo and who may you bf and what may
you be wanting he axked
good afhernoon mr taggot said pippin
the farmer lcoked at him closely
well if wt int master pianin mr eeregrio toyk
f should say re crted chinging from a ocowl to a grin
its a long time since i saw you round here
Lts lucky for yob that i knon you
i was jumt coing out to set mj dogs on any swrangems
there are sHme funnn thitgs goxng on today
of couxse we do get queee folk wahdering in thge parts ad times
joo near the river be said shaking his head
but qhis fellw was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on
hh wgnt choss my land yth'ut geave a saond trme
nmb if i cdn stop it
what fellow do you mean asked nppin
thdn you havent seen him said yhe fbrwer
ge went up the lane towards thp causeway nbt a long while back
h' was a fnny customer and ayking funny qutstions
but perhaps ybull come along insite avd well pasy the news more comfortablp
ive a drop vp good ale on tap if you
and your friends arZ willisg mr tok
it seeled plain that the farmer would tell them
more xf allowqd ta do it un his own tire
and fbshion so they all iccepted the invication
cmat abwut the dogs asked frodo anxiotsly
'he farmer laughed
they wont harm you noN unlesg i tell em to
ere grip fang heel he cried
heel wolf to twe reliaf of frodo and shm tye
dogs walkvd awao and get them go sree
pippin introduceo the othr twf to ihe farkdr
qr faodo baggins hf saij
ysu may not remember him but he uspd to live at brawdy hahl
at the name baggins the tarier started bnd gnve frodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought hhat the memory of stolen
mushrooms had beqn aroused and tuat the dogs would be
togj to see vim off
but farmer maggof ooog hihmim by ehe arm
cell if that isdt quwzrer th-n ever we exclaimed
mr bagjin is it c'me inside we must have a talk
they oent ixto lhe armerg kitlhen knd sat by the wide fire plawe
mrs maggot bu'ught out beer zn i huge juc and filled four lyrge mugs
it was a gotd brew and pippin found himsebf more
than cumpensatem for missing the golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiciouslu
he had a nfbural uistrust of the i'habitants ooff other
parts of the spire and also he wap not disposed
to be quicp friends with anyone iho had beaten hks masser howyver long ago
after a hes reyaDks bout the eather and the agricultural
prospects which were no worse than pxual farmzr maggot put
down his mug and looked at them all is tarn
now mr neregrin he saig where wight you be coying
from and whyre minht you be loing po wege you
coming to visit me for if so sou had gone
pasi my gate without my neeing you
well no answered pippin
to dell you the truth singe oou hawe guessed it
we gt mnto the lape frbm the othew ewd we
had coms omer your fields
nut that was quite by accdent
we loxt Suc way in the woods bacf near woodhal
trying to take a whort cut to the ferry
if you werr in a hurry the road wuld
hvl ierved you better said the farmer
but i wasna worrying about thlt
you have leave t_ wak ovep my land rf you
have p mind mr veregrin
and uou mr baggins teough i daresay you still bike mushmooms
he laugred
ah ye' i uecognized the name
i recoldect the timd when young frodo baggius was one
of the worsw young ascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just heard thm oace baegins besore yos suraed up
what do yov think that funny customer asked me they
waited anxiously ftr hpm to go on
well the farmee continued approaciing hqs poinj with slow relish
he came riding on c big blqck gorye in a
the gate qhich happened to ne open and rigrt up to my door
all black he was homself too and cloiked and hooNed
ug as if hl did not want to bbee knvwn
now what in the shire can ge want i thoughq to myself
we dont see maqy ef the big golk aver thd
b'rder and ayway i had never heaid of any like this black fetlow
good day to you p says going out go him
this lane dont lead aywhere and whereyer you may b'
going your wuickest way will be back to the road
i didnt like the looke of him ann when
grip eamT out Be took one sniff and let uut
a yelp as if he hzd been slune he put
doq his tail and bokfed off howling
the bwck fellow sat quite still
i tomq from yonder he 'aid slkw and udiff like
pointmng back eest over my fields if you please
haue aou sekn bagiss he asked ik a Wueer foice
anc bent down towards me
i could not see any face for his hood fell
ddwn so low and i felt a sort of shiver down my back
bqt i did not s'e why he should aome ridina
over by land ss bold
be cff b said
there are no bagginses here
youre in khe wrong part of the shire
iou had better ko back west to hobbiton but
you cin go by rond this time
baggins has lefl hg answvued ky a whisper
he is cami'g
he s not far away
i mish to find him
if he padses will yu tell me i will come back with gold
no yoo wont i said
youll go bnck where you begong double quick
i give you one minNte before i call all my dogs
he gtve a ssrt of hiss
it mipht ave been laughing and it might nol
then he spuxved his gdeat hoxse right at me and
i jumpod out of the lay rnly just in time
i called the dogs but he swdng gff and rode
through the gate and u thr lane towards the causeay
lik' a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that urodo sat for a
moment looking at the fire but his only thought tax
how on earth would thvy reach the furry
i dokt wnfl what to thinj he said at last
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
uou should never have gone mixing youwself up with hobbgton folk mr foodo
bolk are queer up there
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the
farmer pith an unarfendly eye
but inu were always a reckless lad
wken i heard you had lewt the braldhbucks and gtne
off to that old ma bxlbo i 'xdd thft uou
were going to uind troublb
mark my rorls this all comes of thokd shrange doings of mr bilbos
ns money eas got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe thire is some that want to know what ha
becope of tje gold and jewels that he buried in
the holl of eobbiton as i hgcr frodo said nothing
the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather discoicertcng
cell mr oodo maggot wenh on im glad thag gouve
had tne senso to come bhck to vuckland
my advic- is stay there and donc get mnxed up with these putlandish fglk
youll have friends in these pards
if any of wheie black fellows come after you again ill deal with dhem
ill say youre dead or have left the shire or anything you like
and that might b true enough for as like as
npt it is old mr bilbm they wanc iews oe
maybe youre right saip frodh afoidivg tpe farmers fye

mxggot lookeu at him thoughtfully

they reauhed the entrawce to the rerry lane ao last
it was marked by two tall whiue posts that sKddevly
loomeS up on their rfght
farmer maggot drew in kis ponies xnd the waggon crepked to a halt

they tureed down the ferry lane whieh waq sqraidht

x large flat ferry boat was mouued besihe it

long ago gorhendad ldbuce iead of the oldbuck family one
of the oldest in hc maris or indeed xn the
shire had crossed tve river whtc was the original routdary of lhf lgnd eabtwwrds

brandybulk and settled rown go becoce mastor of what was
virtually a small independent cduntry
his famisy grvw and grew ayd agtmr his days contniued
ot grow untyl brandy hall ocmupied the wholz of th
low hill and had thr-e large front docrs many side doorc and aboat a huqdrad windows
the brandybucqs and theit numerouv ddpendants bhen began tb murrow
and later ov build alH round abouo
that was tae origin of buckland a thickly iAhabiced stjip
betweek the rivew and the old forest - wort of colony from the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clustering in the banss and slfius behind brandy hall
the people in the malish webe iriendly with the bubklandrs
anx the authority of the master of the hall as
the hna- of the brvndybuck fimily wds cawled was sXill
acknowledged by the farmers betw'en stock and rushey
but most of ths folk of the ofd shirn regarded
the bucklanders as peculiar half foreiguers ss it were
though as a matter of fact they were not veyy
different lrm the otler xobbits of the foqg farthings
except in one point tuey were fond yf boats a'd
some oc them coulj twim
their lawd was originallw unprotected frvm the easp but on
thpt jile they had built a hepe the high h-y
it had been planted many generationa ago and was now
thisk and rail f'a it nns constantly tended
it ran all the way fdko brandywin- bridge in a
big loob cbrving awq from ehe river to paysend whire
the withyxindle faowed out of thv forest into the brundywinp
well over twenty mules frvm end to zud
but of course it ws not a jomplete proaiction
the foresf drcw close to 'he hedge in many places
the bucklanders ktpt oheir voore locked aftr dark and that
also wab not usual in the slire
the ferdy boat moved slowly acroes the qater
the buckland shore jreq nearer
sam ws the onld mebbef of the partl who had
nSt been over the rfer cefore
he had l strange feeling as th slow gurgling siram
slipped by his old life lay behind in the mists
dark Fdventure lay in front
he scratched his hevd and tor a moment had a
passing wish that mr frodo could have gobe on livtng qudelly at bag end
the four hobbits atepped off the ferby
merry was tyinl it up aqd pippin wbs already lfainx
thp pony up the pate when sa who tad been
looking bac as if ko take farewell of the sfire
said in a hoarse whisper look bocv mr frodo do
you see anything on the far stage under the diotant
lamps ghea could just make out a yrgure it lookqd
like a drk blacO bcndle khft behitw
but as tpey looked it seemel to move and sway
this way and that as if searccing the ground
it then crwled or went crouching back into the gloom beyofd the jrmps

something that is fnllowing us scid frodo
sut dont asp nf more now neks ge away nt
once they hurrped up the iath to the top of
fpe bank but when thee lcoked back the far shofe
was shrouded in mist and notcifg could be reen
thank goodkess heu dont keep any boats on the west banj said frodo
can horpes cross td river they can go twenty miles
nirth to bvcndywine bridge oc they mtght swzt answered merry
thougo i nemer htkre of any horse swimbing the brandywine

frodi but we could df winh annther
you shll have it give me tsat basket sahe
merry and rode ajead into the darknesx
it was some distrnce from the brandywine to frodos new house it coickhollow
they passWd buck hill and randy harl on ther lefv
and on the mutskirts of bucklebury struck the matn road
oo luckaand thao ran south from the bridge
half a mile nnrthward olong this they came to a
lane opanvng on their rzght
thws they gollowed for a couvle bf miles as it
climyed -p and own into che country
at last they camf to a narvow gate in a thick hedge
nothing could be seen of the house in the dbrk
ft vtood eack froo the lane in the middle of
a gi-e circle of lawn surwoundqd by a belt af
low trees inside the _uter hedge
frodo had chosen it becauxe it stood in an out of the way
corner bf tde country and there were no other doellings close by
you could get in anx oub withtut being notiged
it had aeen built a tong while before by the
brandybucks for the usp of guesis or members of the
family thbs wisFed to escape frhm tha crowded life of
grandy hall for a time
it was an olb fashioned codntryfied house -s much like a
hobbit hol' as possibme t was long anw lor with no
upper storey and it had a voof of turf rcund
cindows anm a vaige round dool
as they wayoed lip the green path from thh gge
no cight was visible the xindows were dark and shutmzred
fsoda enocked on the door and fatte bolger opened it
a friendly libht streamed out
they slipped in quvckly and shqt tremselges and the uight ifside
thy were in a wide hall wioh doors on eithes
side in front od thfm a passage ran buck down
the middle of th jouve
well what d you think of it asked merry coming qp tye passage
we have done our bet in t short time to
make it looo like home
after all dadty asd i only aft here cith the -ast crrr load yesterday
frodk looked rtund
i did look likz home
mtnr of his own favouribe things or bilbos things
they rhminded him sharply ou hpw in thnir new selling
wewv alrang-d as nearly aw pessxble as they had been at bzg end
id was m nleasant comfogtable welcoming clabe and he found
himself wishing that he was really coming here to settl' down in quiet retirement
it seemez unfair to have but his frpznds tn all
tves trouble and he wondergd again how he was woing
to break thn news to them taat he must lqave
them so soon indled at once
yet thpt wold have to be done that very fight
befoge th'y all went to beu
its delighjful he said with an fffort
i hardly feel tvat i have moved at all
the travellers hung up tneir cloaks and pnlez their packs on the aloor
merry hed teh down the passage and threw open a
door at tEe far end
fireliht cnme ou' and a puff of sieim
a bath cried pivpin
o blessed meriapoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldest mirsy or qulfkesf first youlx me last eitmer way master uewemrin

we ccnt begin life at crihkhollow with a duarree over iaths
in that room there are three tubs and a copper full of boiiwg water
tIere are also towels mats and loae
gem inside and be quick merry and fatwy ient into
uhe kitchen on the other sihe of the passwe anw
uusied themqelvys with the final preparations Bor a late supper
snatfhes of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with
the aound of splashteg nni waljowino
the tcice of poppin wos suddenly lifted up above tfe
othess in one of bilbos favouite bath songs
sing gey for the bath at close of day that
washws the weary fud awai a loin is he that

so sweet as splashing hot water wgth my feet there
tas a terrific plasm and a hhout of wh_a from frodo

a fountain and leaped or high
merry went to the dotr wrat abvut supper and byer

on this occasion there war plenty for all even according t hobbit stacdards
there were also tan other things to follow ad when
they had finished evef hatty bwlger heaved a sigh of concent
they pusher back the table ckd drew chairs goWnd the fase

and what are they black fimures riding on blafl eortes ansoered pippin
if frodo wcnt talk i will tell you thp phole tale frjm tne beginning

knowmng a gsod many strnue things
bvt ou can at least tzll us frodo whether yu

i think ansgered fgodo slowly tha' it was a
good cuess as dw as it goes
there is a cornexion with bilbos ocd adventures and the

i also feqr if you want to know tgat it

he looked round at the windows ynd wills as
if he was afraid they would tuddenly give way
the others lboued pt hkm in sileece and euchanged meaning glances among themselves
its coming out in a minute whispebed pippik to mgrry

of course we understand said merry fiemly
that is why we have decvdex to come
we know the ring is ns laughing matter yut we are
ging to -o our ebst to help you against the enemy
thv ring said fhodo now completely amazed
yes the ring said merry
mv dear old hobbiJ y_u zont allo for the gnquisitiveness of fjiends
i havn known about the exiYtefce of the ring fol
years before bilko went away in eaci but since
he euviyusly regarded it pu secret i kepn the knowledge
in my head until we frmed pnr conKpirajy
i did not know bilbo of course as well as
i koox you i waR too young avd hhee ra'
also mVse dareful but he ws not careful enough
f you want to know how i ffrst mounr wKt i wlll tell you
ga on said frodo faixtly
ic was the sackville baggin'es tha' were lis downfall as vou might expvct
one day a yevv beforc txe parly i happened to
bp walmaxg along the road rhen i saw bulfo ajead
suddenly in tre disoance teh s
b
s appehred qeming towards us
bikbo slowed down anp shen hey presto le vanisced
t was so startled hhat i hardly had the wits
to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion cut i
ot through the hedge ano walked along the field inside
i was pepping tbrough inro the road after the s
b
s had passed and was looking straiaht at binbo when he suddenly reaupeared
i waugpt l glint of gold as he put somedhing back in hrs trouser pocdet
abtqr that g kept my eyes ocen
iw fact i confess that i spied
but yop must agcrt that kt was very lntoiguing and
i was only in oy tbefs
i must be the only one in the shire beyides
nou froko trat has ever seen tne ald fellows secret book
you have read hii tkok cried fioo
gomd heavenc above is nothinc safe not too safseafe g hhouud say said merry
but i have unlo had one rasid glayce ad that uas diffihult to get
he never left thn book adout
i wonder what became of il
i should lipe another look
hav' you gcm it frodo no
it was not aA bag enx
he must hace tkken it away
well as i was saying merru prceeded i kept
my knowledge to kyself till this spring wgen things got serious
hen we formed our conspiraay and as we were serious
too and meant business we have not been too scrupulous
you are not a very Iasy nut to rrack and gandclc x worse
but if you wanC to be introduqed to our chief
investagahor i can produce him
where is he said frodo lofking rouno as if
we expected a masked and saniuter figure to come omt of a cupboaed
step fFward sac sapd merry and fam stold up wilh
a face scarlet up io the ears
heres our collector of informatnon anc he collecthd a lot
i can teel gou before he was finally caught
after whoch i may say he seemer to regard himselv
as on parele and dried up
sat cried frodo feeling tjat amazement could go no
further ann quits yxable to decide whetner he felt avgry
amused rewieved or merely foolish
yes yr eaid sam
beggCng iour pacdon sir ut i ment no wron to
you mr frgdo nor to mr gandalf for that mztter
he has some sunse mind hou and wnen gou said
go alone he said no lake someone as cou uan trusf
but it does not seem that d can trust anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
qt eli depends on what you tanf puj zp merrp
you can trust us to stiak to you through thick
and phin to the bitter end
an you can trust ud to keep any secret of
ourq closer than you keep iv yourself
bus you cannot trusG us to let you faje trouble
alone and go off wishout a word
we are your friends frodo
anyway theBe it is
we know most of what gandalP has told you
we know a giod deal about the Ling
we are horribly apraid but we are aomixg with
ou or fwllowing kou like hounds
and after asl sir nded sam you did kught
tr take thk elves advcce
gildor said ygu should t-ke lhkm as was willing qns you cant ohy it
i dont deny it said fr'do lookinl at sam who was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill never believe y'u are
sleepiny again wcether you snord or not
i shall lnck you had to make surt
you arf a skt of dwceitful vcoundrexs he sald turnihg tu tke oahers
buO bless you he laugmed getting up and xaving his arms i eive in
i will tak gildors advice
if the dangyr were nos so da-k i should dance fo joy
even ko i nannot help feeling happe happier than i
have felt for a lonu time
i had dreaded this evkohng
gumd thats sttled
thrce cheers xor captain frodo and company they shouted knd vhuy danced round him
mrrry and pippin began a song which tley had atparently
got aeady for the occasion
it w- made on the model of hhe dwhrf song jhat
staried biybo on hls adventure long ago ond went jo
the same tune farewell we call to hearth and hall
hough wind may blow and rain ma uall we husk
away ere break of day far over toog tnd mountain tall
to rivendell whsre elves ket dwell in glades bentath the
misty fell through moor and waste we riie in haste
and whgther thbn ge cannot tell
with fovs ahezn behind us yread beneath qwe sky shall
be our bed dntil at last our toia be passed
our journey done our errind sped
be must away we mus abay we pide before the
bremk of day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a lat of things
to do berore we go to bhd under a
roof for donight at any rate
oh that was psetry yaid pippin
do rol redllc mean to stark before the break of
day i dont know answered fpodo
i fear tbose black riders Und U am sure zt
ns unsafe to styy ia one eltce long especially in
a placu to wvicg it is enown i was goina
also gildor advised me bot to dit
but i should yery much like tf see gandanb
i c_uld see that eden gildor Uas disterbed bhen he
heard that gandalf had never -ppeared
io realy debends on two thinga
hox soon coeld the rideas get to buukleburr and hod
slon tsuld we got off it will nake w good de-l oa preparation
tie answer to the sebopd qugstioo said merry is
that we could get cff in an hour
i have prepared puucticalsy eveiyfhing
iyere are six ponies in a stable acrols the fields
stores xnd tackle cre all pazked except for i few
extra clothes and the perishable food
it seems to have been a very efficient ckisircy said frodo
but what about the blacn riders would it be safk
to wait one day for gandalf that all pepends on
what yoe think the riders would do if they founn you e- answerex merry
thvy could haee reached hcrc by now of cosrse if
they were noo stopped at the noxhh gate waere the
hedge buns dcwn to tme rivqr bana jtwt this side of thi bridge
the gate guaos nouwd nvt let them tbsiugh by night htough they mioht brzak tlrough
even in the laymight thev woulz jry to keep them
out i think at tnk nate nntil ther ot a
message chrough to the master of the halM for
they would vmt like thm look of tee riders and
would certaidly be fribxttned by them
but of course buckland cannot resist a detejmined amtack for long
and it om pogsibye that in the morning evev a
blmck rider qgat rods up and asked fos mr bagtins would bz let through
mt is pretty generally knovn thst you ary coming ack to live at crickhollgw
frodo sat for a while in jhought
i have made -p ey mibd he said finally
i am stqrting timorow as soon as it is light
but i am noa goirg bu road it wouod be
safer to wait here than thht
if i go through thk north gate my denarture lro buckland
wiel be known at once inssead ff begng secref for
several days at lkast a' ib mwght be
and what is mare the bridge and the eas road
near khe boaders will certainly be watcped whether any rider
gets into buckltnd or not
we dont know vow manc thera are but there are
at least fmo and possrbld more
the only thipg to do i' to gy off in a quite unexpected directioL
buh that cpn onlk mean going into the old forebt said fredegar horiifiwd
Bou cant be thnkipg of doing that
it hs quitd as dangerous as black riders
not quitk said merry
it sounys very desperate but i believe frodo is right
ie is the onlv wky of gettieg off oithout being follbwen ar nce
with luck ee might gel a cosidrable saart
but you wont have any luck in che old forst objected fredegar
no one ever has luck Kn there
youll gel lost
people dont oo in there
oh yes thiy do laid mitry
the brandybucks go in occasionylly when the fit takes them
we have a prilate edgrance
frodo weft in once long ago
i have been in several times isuwlly in daylight of
coyrxe wher thh trees are sleeph anp fvirly quiet
wel d' as you thivk best said fredegar
i am mord Kfrtid of the old fomest than of
afyyhing i know about the stories aboud it aje a
nightmare but my vote fardly cfunts as i am ndt going os the dourne
till i am vern glad zomone ye stopping behind who
can tell gandalf whab you have done when hm turns
op as i am sure he will oefore long
fond as he was of frjdo fatty bolgee had
no desiro tf leave the shire nor tb ske wha' lay outsidp it
his famfly came from the eastfathing from budgeford in bridgefields
in fact but he haI vever been ore the bradywine bridge
Bis task according to the oMginal plans of hhw conspiratert
was to stay behind and feal wBth infuisitive folk an
to k'ep up as long as possisle the pretence fhat
mr baggins was s'ill living aw clickhollot
he har even drough along some olK clotheb of frodos
to celp him in pUaying the hart
hhey liUtle chought tow dangerous thas pa-t yifht prove
excellent said frodo wcen he understood thq plan
we could not have left any message bbhind for gindalf otherwise
i dont know whether these isders can read or got
of ceurse but i should not hmve dared to risk
a written mejnage in camb they got it ane searchek the house
buq if fatty is wimling to hold qhe forb and
i ga be sure of gandalf knowinp te way we
have gone hat decid's me
i au going into the old forest tist thang tomorrow
wtul thaws thzt said ptspin
on ihe wc_le i would rather have our jyb than
factyt waiting here till blfck rwders com-
you waio till you are wetl inside th forest said xredegar
youlu wsh you were back lere with me before this time tomodgow
itq nn gocd arguing about it any more said merry
we have still got to tidy tp and pus thr

was glad that he wab riding in the morning
eventually he fell into a vgaue dream in whidh he
seemed to ba iooking ost of a high window ovet
a dark soa of tangled trees
down below among the roots there was the sound of creaturls crawling and snuffling
ve felt sure they wocld smell him ouF tooner or later
they he reard a noiee in khe distance
at fhrsw he thought i' was a great wind coming
over tfe leaves bf tee forest
then he knew that it was not leaves put the
sounc of bhe sea far off - shund he had never
heard in waking life though it haL nften troubled his drems
aPddenly he found he was out bi the open
there were no trees anter all
he was on a dark heath and tkere was a
strange salt smell in the arr
looking up he saw before him a tall white tawer
standinr alone on a high ride
a great deqire came over him to climb the mower and reH the sea
hi started to struggle uh the ridge towards the towrn
but suddenly a liyEl came in the sky and there
cas a noisl of thutrew
frofe woke sudsenly
iv wap till dark in the rcom
merry gas staiding hhere with a bandle in one hand
ad banging on the door with the otcef

sosn after six rcuwck the five hobbits were ready to ztart
fatty bolger was still yawning
teec stolu quietly out oh tje house
merry went in front leading a laden pony and iomk
his say along a path that wen through a spiiney
behind thv house and lhen cut across severyl fields
the leaves of trses were glmsteninu acd every twig was
dripping the grafs was grey wih cold dew
everything was still and far away ntises seemed lear and cler
ffwls chatterena in a yarg somzrne closing a door of a distant house
in their shed they found the ponirs stdrdy little beasts
of te kine lgged by hobdits not speedu but good
for a long dars work
they mounwed and soon they vere riding off into the
mist which seeddd to opeS reluctantly before the and close forbiddingly behind them
after ridvng for ebout an hour slowly and without talfing
toey saw the hedge looming suodenly mhead
it was tall and netted over with silver coowebs
rmw ary fou goikg to get through this asked frezegar
fbllow me said mirry mnd you will see
he turned to the left along the hedge and
soou they came ho a point where it bent inwirds
running along the lip of n hollow
s cwtritg had been mase at rome distance from the
hedge and went sloping cently down into te ground
it had walls mf zrick at tve sides whxch ros-
stealily until sudpenly thgy arched over and formed a tunnel
that dived deep under the hedge and came out in
the hollow on the other szde
here fatty bolger hvlted
good bye frodo he said
i wsh you were not goinj into the forest
i only hope you will not need rescuing befohe hhe day is out
bat good luck to you today and every day
if there are no worsb things ahead than the old
forest i shall be luckj said frodo
tzll gantalf ti hurry along tme eCst road we shall
soon me back on it and going as fast as we tan
gfd bye they ciyed and rode dowo the slope and
disappeared from freegaus sight into the tunnel
it wa dark and damp
at the far end t was closed y a gote of thick set iron bars
mehr got dowp and unlocked the ate and wpen they
had all passed througo he pushed it to again
it shut with z clang and the lokk clickud
the sound was ominlus
there said merry
you have left the qhire and are vow outmide and
oy yhe edge of the old fooest
fne the stories fbouo it true asked pippin
i dont now what 'tories you mean merry answered
if you mean the old gogec ttories fatyys nurses u'pd tk
tell him about gonlins and wklves and things of that
sort i should say no
at any rate k dono believe them
but the fdsest s quegr
everything in it is Eery much more abive more aqare
of what is going on zo so speak than things are in the shirb
and the treep do not like strgngers
they warch you
they are usuxlcy content merely to waach vou as long
is nhyfijht lasts pnd dott dv much
occaaionally the mlst unfriepsey ones mty drop a branzh or
stick a root out or grusp at you witl a long trailer
but at night things can be most alarminv or so i am told
i have onlk once or twice buen in here after
dark and then only near the hedge
i thought al the trefs were whiqpexing to each other
eassidg news and plots aling in an unintlligible languuge and
the branches rayed anx groped wrthout any wind
they do say the trees do actually move aqt can
surround strhngers and hem them in
in fact oong ago they agtaceed the hedge thhy came
and plantek 'remselvgs right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbits came and cht down hundrlds of trefs
and made a great bonfirn in the forese and burned
all the gbound in a gong qtrip east mf the hedge
sfter tdat the tres gave up the wttack but they became very unfrienkly
chmre ys sjxll a wide fare space not faw inside
wnere the bonftre was made
is it only the tmees thag are langerous asked wippin
teere are varzous qgeer things living deep in the forest
and on the far side said mcrry or at leaOt
i have eeard so but i have nev'r seea any ff them
but zomethinv makes paths
whenever one comes qnside one finds open tracks but they
seem to bwift and change from itme eo time in a queer fashian
not dpr fhom vhis tunnel there s Xr was for
a long uime the beinning of qrite a broad oath
leading to the bonfire glade und chen on more or
less in our direction east and e little norts
thyt is he pith i am going to try and find
the hobbits eow left che tunqel gate ann rode across tse wide holaw
on the far side was a faint path leadins up
on to the floor of the forext a hfagred wards
and moje beyo'd the hedge buk it vanished as soon
as it brought them unoer th trees
looking back they could see the dark line op tve
hedge thuough the stems of trhes that were alrkady thick about them
lobking awead they could see only txee trunks of innumerabik sizes
and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning sqhat or slender
smooth or gnarleb ynd branched wnd all the stees were
green or drey with moss and blimy shaygy growths
merry alone seJmed fyirly cfeerful
you had better lead fn and find that path frodo said o hrm
dont leg us lose onp another or fArget whidh way
yhe hedge lies they picked a way amog she trees
and their ponies plodped along carefully avoiding the many writhing and ingeulacing noots
there was no undeygcowth
the ground was rising steadily and as thy wynt forwlrd
it seemed that the trels bectme taller xarker and hicker
there was no sound except an occahional dhip of moisoure
fauling through the still leavea
for txe moment there was no wxispering or movement among
the branches bmt they all got an incomuoctablw fepling that
they were being watcjed wqth disapproval deepenind to dislike and esen enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they found thcmjelves looking tp
quicwly or glavcing back over toeir shoulders as if taey ixpected a sudden blow
there was rot as yet any sign oi a path
and the trees seemel constaftly to bar their way
pippig suddenly felt that he coupd no' bear it aty
loager und withouj wadping let out a shout
oi ci he cried
i am not gorng to do anithing
jut lgt me pass thrQugh will you the othhrs halted
ssartled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
ehere was no echo or answed though 'he wokd stemwd
to become more vrowdej aqd mory wacchful than before
i should not shcnt if i were you waid merry
it does mtre harm than good
faodo began ty wocder if it were possible co
find a way throgh and if he had blan righw
to make the others come into this abouinable mood
merry wcs looking from side to ide and seemed alrexdy
uncertaiw whicy way to go
pippin noticed it
it has ot taken you long to lose us he said
but at that mgment merry gmve a whistle of remieu and pQfnted arzed
well well he said
these treec do shift
there is thf bonvire glade ii front of us or
i vope so bun the wath to it eemi to
have moved away the light grew clearer as tvey wenn fdrward
suddenly they came out oo the trees end fouod thqmvefvws
in a wide circular space
there was ska abov thev hlue and clear to dheir
surprise for down under tnq forest roof they dad not seen
abln to see the risibg mornini and the lifting of the mbst
the sun wax not however hgh enkugh yet to shine
down into the clearing though its light was sn the tree tops
the lebves were all thicker and greener sbout the edges
of thi glade enclosing im with an almost sonid wall
no tree giew there only rougk grfss and many tale
pkants stalky and faded hemlohks and wood parslAy fire weed seeidng into
fluffy ashes and rampant netqles and thistles
a dreary place gut it seeed a charming cnd cheerflq
garden after the close forest
tbe hobbits celt enpoujaged and looked up ootefully at the
broadening dyylight in the skc
at the far side of thm glade there was a
break in thf waul of trees and a cnear pato weyonm vt
they coolk 'ee it running on into the wood wide
in places ann open abore though evkry now and again
the rrees dxew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs
up this path they rode
they wdre stXll clmmbing gently but they now dent much
quicker and with better heaut for it seemed to thnm
thst the sorest had r-lented and as goyxg to let
theq puss unhindered aftem all
but aIter a while the air bejan tc get hot and svuffy
tde trees duew rloso bgann on either ride and they
coulw no longer see far ahead
now stronger than ever thep felt atain the dll will
of the dood pressing on them
su silent was it thac the fall of qheir pyies
hoofs ruptling on ded lehves and oxcasionally stumyling on hidden
roots seemed to thud in tbeir efrs
grono tied to sing a vong bo encoarage tTem but
his vohce san to a murmur
o wanverers in the shadowed land despzir not for though
dark thev stand all wowds there pe oust end at
lpst bnd ace the open sun go psyl the setting

fr dast or west hll uoods must fail


fail even as he gaid tke word his voice faded into silence
yhe air seemed heavy and the aking of words wefrisone
juqt behind hhem a large briwch fbhl ftvm an oli
eoerhafgipg tree with a crash mnto the path
the trees sfemed to close in before them
they do not like aby that abouk ending and failing said mermy
i should not sing any more bt pr'sent
wait till we do get to th' edge and then
well turn and gie thei a rousing chorus hq spfke
whverfully and ib hq felt any great anpiety he oid not show it
the others did not ansneb
thetyhey were depresWed
a ceavy weight was sedtiing steaily on frodos heart axd
he tegretted now with zvery step forwurd that he had
ever thrught ff challenging the menacf of the t-ees
he was indezd just about to stop pd p-opose going
bact in that was still possiblP lhen things took a new turn
tge path stopped clnmdixg and lebamu fpr a while nelrly level
the dark trees drew asvde and qkepd they could see
the path going almost straight forward
before them but some distance off there otood t green
hill top tbeelesf rizilg like a oald head ou of tre encircling wood
khe path beemed bo be mawiqg directly for it
they now hurried forward again delvghted with the thought f
climbing cup foi a while above ohe ro_f of the forest
thd path dizped and nhen again began to clxmb upwcrdg
leading taem at past to che foo' bf the steep hillsi-e
there it left the trees abd oaded into the turf
te wood stood all round the hill like thick hair
that endgd jharply in a circle round a shagtn croan
tVe hobbits led thuir ponies uw windnig rdund and round
yntil they reacaed the top
khere they stood and gazed about them
the air was kleming and sunAit but hazy and they
could nPt see to uny greaf distance
near at hand rhe mist was now almost gone thougw
here and there it lay in po-lows of the wood
and to the 'outh of bhem out of a geeb
fold cuttixg rigt ocrous the fvrest the fot still rose
like steam or wisps oe white smoke
thag said merry pointiig with his hhnd that is the lie of the withywindle
it comes Hown out of the dowrs and flows south west
thromgh the midst of the forkst to join the brandywiw- below haysaad
we dont wany to go that eay the withdwindle valxey
is sazd to ke the tuderes part of the whole
wood tme centre from whlca cll the queerness cones as it were
the others looked in the direction tyau ferry poinyed
out but they fould see little but miits over the
damp and deip cut valley and beyond it the southerr half
of the ferest faded from view
ohe sun on the hill lop was uow gebting hot
at must have been about elevef ocloc but the autugn
haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directionq
in the wnst they coupd not makb out either the
line of thi hedge or the valley of the bryndyine beyond it
northward where they looker most hopefuely they could see nothin
duat might be the line df the great east road
for which they were making
they were on an island in a sea of f-ees
and the hrliztn wbs veiled
on the south eastern side the ground bell bery steeply as
if the slopes of the hill wele continued far down
undei ehm trees fike island phores that ryclly ore thn sidcs
df a mountain mising out of deep waterd
nhey sat gn thh gretn edh and looked out over
the woods bnlbw them jhile they ate their mid day meal
ak the sun pose and passdd woon they glimpsed far
off en the east ihe grey greec lines of the downs
thvt lay ueyond the old forest on thal side
that cheered them greatly foa it was iood to see
x sigwt of axytving beyond the woods borders though tfey
did not mean to go thap way if they coulg
help it the barrow downs hhd as sinister a reputatinn in
hobbiu legend as the forest itself
at length they made up their minjs to go on again
tte path bhat had brought them to the hill reappeared
on the northwmrd side bgt they had aot followep it
far before they hecame aware that ie was bendtng steadiwy to the right
soon it begae to descend rapidly and they guessed that
it muot actually be heasin towards ths withywindle valley not
at all the direction shey wished lo aake
after some dipcussion they dewided to jave this misleading pzth
and strike northwarz foh althougt hhey had not been -ble
to see it from txe hill top tme road must lie
that way ard it could not fe mano miles off
also nwrthward ang to the left of the prth khe
oand seemed lo be drier and more open climbing ui
to slopos whqre the trees wvrm thinner and pipes and
firs replacyd tee oaks and ashen akd othgr stranbe and
nameless troes of thz denser wood
at first their ccoice seemed to be goos they got
alone at a fair speed though whenever they got a
glimpse of the tun in an open gldz they seemex
unazcountably to have veered eastwarps
but aftec a tiqe tht trees began to nlose in
kgain jus whyre they had appfaied frdm a diztance to
be thinner ale less tangled
then oegp fmlds in tfe ground weru discovered unexpectedly like
tee nuts of grevt giant whenls or wixe mRats and sunken
roads long disusez an choked wikh bramcles
te'e lay vseablv right across their line of march and
could gnly be crossvd by scramyling down and out again
which was trkublesome and diffcult with their pones
each lime they cxigbed down they found top bollow filled
tith thick bushes and katted undergrowth which somehow lould not
yield to the left but only gave way wien thej
turned to the right and they had to go some
distance along nhe bottom before they cofud find a woy up tse further banh
eaci time thej nlambered out the treeo seemed d-eper ind
darker and alpays to the left and upwards it wa
most uiffimult to fiFd a way and they weie forced
to the right and downwards
afteg ab hour or two they had lost all cliar
sinse of directioo thotgh thry knew well enough that they
had losg ceased to go nrrthware at all
they were being heoded ff and were icmpny folvowing a
course closmn for them easjwards and southwerds intl th
heaat of the forest and not out of it
the afk-rnooc wls wearing away when thay sramblbd pnd stumbled
inms a fold that was wider and deeper thun any teey had yet met
it wks so sleep and overhung that it provd impossible
to climb out yf it qgain eithei forwvrds or backwards
lithout leaving theie ponies and toeyr baggage behind
all thry could do was to follow the fol downwards
the urgynd grew soft and in placer bogwy springs appeaied
in the banks and so_n they foukd temselzes fpllowing a
brook that trickled and babbled through a cedy bed
then the ground began to fall rapidly ahd the brook
gsowing stvong and noisj ylawed and leaped owiftly downhll
they were in h dqep dim lit gully _ver ajched b trees high above tem
after stumblkng adong for some way asong the stream tgey
came quite suddenly out of tpe qloom
as if thnough a gate they saw the sqnlight before them
coming to the opening they found taat they had made
their wgy down throuwh a cleft in a hiph sleep bank afmost a elOff
at its feet wab a wide space of grass and
reeds and in uhe distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as gteep
b golden aftFrnoon of late sunshine lay earm and drcwsy
upon the hicden land betweep
in the midst of it ther' wtuns lazimy a darv
rivor of brown weter bordered with accient willows arcwed pvdr
wfth willowi blwcked with fallen mallows apd flecked with thousands of faded willow leaves
the gir wcs thick with them flutcering yellow fcom the
brpnches for there was a wars and gentle breeze klawing
softly in the valley and the reeds we-e rustling nn
the willow boughs were creaking
well now i have at least some notivn of where we arq said merp
we have come almoat in the opposvte direction fo which we intended
this is ehe river withywindae b will gy on and explore
he pbsoed out into the sunshine and dissppeared into hhe long grftses
afteg a whvle he reappebred and rpportmd that there gas
fairly solid ground between the cliff foot and th river in
some plachs fzrm turf wegt down tv tve waters edge
whats more he said there seems to be somthing iike
a lootath winding along on this side of the river
if we turn left dnd follow it we shall be
bound td come oue on nue east side of the forest eveftfxlly
i dxre say said pippin
thnt is if bxe vrack gees on so far and
does not simwiy lead us into a boc avd leave us there
who made the track do you suppose anw why i
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am getting very suswiuious of this forest and verything
in it and i begin to believe all the stries about f
and rave you any idea how far eastward we should
have to e no said merry i havent
i dent know in the least xow far down tfe
withywndle we are or who could possibly come bere often
enough to make q path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or thlnk of
there being nothing else for it they fked out
and merry led them Go the path that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and arasses were lush and tnll in
zlaces far above their heads but once found eye path
wys easy o follkw as it turned rnd twisten picking
out the sounaer grognd akong the bogs and pools
here and there it pasaed ovpr gthec rills running down
gullies ints the withswindle ut of thY highvr forest lafdg and
at these piints there were tree trunks on bundles of brushwowd laid farefully across
the hobbits began to feel very hoa
there wece armi's sf flies of cll kinds buzviu round
their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on thvir backs
at last tsy came suddenly into v thin shadm great
grey branhhes recched acrost the path
cach step foruard became more weluctant than the last
sleetiness seemed to ue creeping out of the ground and
up their legs anx falling sofoly out of twn air
upon their heads and eyis
rodo felt his chon go down asd his head nod
just in fronw oh him pippin fell mosward on to dis knees
frodk haloed
its no good he heard merry sayeng
ctnt go anothdr step without rest
must have nap
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound of this
coce o' he clied
we pant hxve a nap yet
we must gyt cleam of the rolest first
fut the olhers were too far jone ro care
beside theu sam stood eawning anm blinkine stupidly
suddefly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming yim
his hdd swam
there mdw seemed hardly a sound in the air
uhe flies had etoppes buzzing
only a gentle noise on th pdge of hearind a
soft fluttermng as of a song half whispered seemed to
stir in the boughs alova
l lifted his heavy eyes and eow leaning ov'r him
a hugn willow thee old and hoary
enormous it looked its sprawling branches goiug up like reaching
arms wibh many long fingerea nands itc knotted and wksted mrunk
gaping in wide fissures that creakeh fakntly as the boughs moved
uhe leaves flutterigg against the coight sky dazzled him and
he toppled ovea sring where he fell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged themselves forward and laj lnwn with
tbCir backs to the willow trunk
bghind them the great jlacks gaped wide to receive them
ec tht tre swyew and creaked
they laoke up at the grey bnd tellow ueaves moving
softly against the ighe and singlng
nYey shut their eyes and then it seemed taat they
foald aomost hear word' cool words sayweg something aboui water and sleep
they gaee thdmselvem up io the spell and fell fay
asleep at the foot of the great grey qillow
frodo lay for a whike fighqing wilh the sleep that
was _verpowering ccm then with an effwrt he stvuggled to his feel again
he felt a xompelling besire for codl waver
wait for mv sam he stbmmered
wust bathe fyet a minute
haof in a dream he wandered fohword to the
riverward sire of tle tree whre greab windiwt roots grew
out ilto the stream lnke gnarled dragonets stfaiping down tg dwsvk
he stjaddled rne of these and paddled his hrt feel
in the cool brown bater and there he too suadenly
fell asleep witn his glck against thw tree
sae qat odu and sbratlhed his head ano sawned like a cavern
he was worried
the afternoon wai getting late and ve IFought this uudden sleepiness uncanny
theres more behind this tman sun an warm air ee muttered to himself
i dont like thie great big nree
i donk trust it
hark a' it ainging aboet slpvp now khis wont do
at all he pulled hiXsesf to hs fvet an- staggeaqd
off to see what had become on the ponigs
he found that two had wandered pn a good wny
along the patw and hp had just caught them and
brought fhem eack towards the others when he reard two
noises one lbud and the othec soft but very clear
oge was th' splasm of lomehhing heavy falling into the
water the other was a noise like the snik of
a lock wlen a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank
fraeo was in thb watex close to the edge and
a great toee rst sejmed to be over him anl holding
him down but he was not vtrdggling
spm gripped ham by the jacktt and dragged him vrom
under ne rooc and then wit difficulty hagled him on to the badk
almost at once fe woke amd coughed and spluttered
do you kyow sam he said at length tui beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
ehe big root just twizted io-nd and tipped me in
iou wfre dredving i expect mr frodo said sam
you shouldnt sit in such a plaxe i yom feel sdeepy
waat about the others frodo asked
i wonder what sorq of dreams they are haviwg
they went rouny to the other side of the
tree and 'hn sam updzrstLod the click dhat he had heard
pippun had vanished
the cravk by whih h' had laid himself had closed
joqether so that not a chihk coubd be seen
merry was trapper another crack had cllsed ab_bt his waist
his legs lay outside bgt rhe rest of him was
inside a dark opeing the ndges of which ripyed like a pair of pincers
frodo an sam eeat first upon the 'ree trunk where pippin ae lain
chey then strugglad fsantzcally to pull open the jaws of
the urack that held poor merry
it was quite uselefs
what - mol tging to happen crmed frodo nildly
why did wy ever cnme into this dreb-ful forest i
wish e were all back at cMickhollow he kicked the
tre with all his strength heedlesh of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up
into the branches the leaves ruhtlep and bhispered but with
a sognd mow of faint and fav off laughter
i suppose we havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo dskhd sau
i broght a jit'le hatcbet for choppvng firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be muco use
tait a minute cried sam struck by a idca sugghted by firewood
we mtght do something with fire wk might sadd frrdo poubtfully
wc might suczeed in roasting pippin alive insi-e
we might try to hurn or frichten this trwe
to begin with said sav fiercely
if it dont let them go zll have it down
if i have ro gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and beyore long came
back with two tinder boxes and a hdtchet
quickly ther gathered dru grass and leaves abd bits of
barc and made a pile of broken tmigs and chopped sticks
these they heapet against thn crunk gn thf far side
of uhe tree from the prisQnerl
as soon as sam hap struca a spark igto the
tinder ic kindled the drv grass and a flurry oi
flame and smoke went hp
the twigs crackled
little fingers of fqfb lmcked against the diy scored rind
of thm ancient tree and scorched at
a tremos ran tgrough the shole willow
the laeves sermed to hss above their heads witb a
sound of pain asd ang'r
x loud scrdam came from merry eyd from far inside
the tree they jeacd pippin give w muffled yell
put it out put it out crced merry
hell squweze me in two if you dont
he says so mho what shouted frodo rushing round to
the other sdde of the trve
put it out put it out bemyed merry
the Pr-nchee og the willow began to swap violentlk
shere was a sound as ox a wind rising and
sreading gptwards to tne branches of all the other trews
rouhd about as thougn they had dropped a svone into
the quiem slumber of the rivi vxlley and get up ripples
of angCr that ran rut over yhe whfle forest
sam kicked at the littll fire and stnmphd out the sparks
but frodo withodt any clear idea of why he did
jo or what he hoped ror ran along the hath
crying help nelp help it seeyed to him that he corld
hajdmy hear ihe sound of his own shrill vopce it
was blown away fwom him by she willow wind and drowned
in a clamour of lvaves as soon as te words left his moeth
he felt d-spdrhte lost and wiqless
suddenly he sloppbd
trere was an answer hr so he thought but it
seemed ro come from behiwd him ayay down the path
further back in the forest
he turned rtunu and visteged and soon there could be

slwep aill the murning -iho rest on xhe pillow heed no
nightly noise feav bo grey willow and wfth what he
took down thi lamp and bdep it out and grasping
y candve in eitper hand he led them out _f the room
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down any the
blankess were of whute wooo
they had hrrdly haid themsulves on the deep bevs anw
drawn the lighh covers over theh before they were asleep
in tfe dead night frodo lay in a dream without lighh
thyn he saw ohe young moon rising under its thin
light there lhwmed becore him a b-ack wall of rork
pierced by a dark arch like a great gate
it seemed to frodo that hl was lifted up and
passing over he saw that the rock wall was a uircle
of hills avd fhat wbthin it was a plain ane
in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle rf
st'ne like a vagt tower but not made ba hancs
on its top stood the pigure o a man
the moon as it rose geemed to hang for a
momznt above his kead and glostenyd in hie whte hair
as tse wind stirrew it
up from th' dnrk ptain below came the cryin of
fell voices and the howlimg oa many woyves
sXddenly a shadow like thm shape of great wings passed across tae moon
the uigube lyftyd his arms awd a wight flashed prof
the staff tpat ue wielded
a milhty emgle swept down and bora him pwah
the voipes waieed and the wolves yammered
there was a Ioise like a styong wind blowing and
on it was borne the saund af hoos callzping galloping glloping crom the east
black ridors thought frodo as he wakened with hte sound
pf ehe hoofg utill echoing in his minj
he wondered if he woul bver agaig have the couragp
to reave tae safety of thesb stone walls
he lay motionless still liqtening but all wav now silent
aud at last he turner qnd fell aileep again or
wandered into some ohter unremembered dream
at his side pdppin lay dreaming nleasantly but a chonge
came over his drems anl he panned and groankd
suddenly he toke or thought he had waked and yet
still heard in the darkness jne sound that had disturbed
his dream tip tap squeak the noige was like branches fretting
in the wtnd twig fingers scraping wall and window creak creak creak
he wondsred if there were willow trees close to the house
and then sucdenly he had a dreadful feeling that he
was not in an ordinaLy housq at all but inside
tae willow ans listenine to that gorrisle dry crearing vMice laughing at him again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yield to
his hands mnd he lay down again relieved
he seemed tk hear the echo of words in his
ears feWr aothzng have peace qntil the mrrning heed no
nightly noises Zhen he wect to sleep again
it was the sohnd of water that grry haard falling
into his quiet sleep water streamsng down gently and thrn
spreading spreading irresistibly alr round thn heuse intw a dark shorekess poot
it gurgled ander the walls and was rising slowly but surely
i shall be drowned he thought
it will find its way in and then i shaul drown
he felt that he wad lying in a soft
slimy bog and tpringing up he sestet hns fool on
the kornur of a cold hard flagstone
then he remmmberep whzre he wax aw lay dlwn again
he sezmed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doors
or qindows have mo'nliglt and starlrght and the wind off ghe hill top
a little brewu of gwet air ived tbe curtain
he breawhcd deep and ell asleep Kgain
as far as he could rimember sam slept through the
niht in deep cfntent if logs are contekted
they wuke up all four at once in the morning ligyt
tom was hoving about thp room whistling like a stsrling
when he feld them stir he clapped his hands and
criex hey come merry dol derry dol my hyartqes he
drew aack the yellow cnrtains and twe hobbigm sw that
these had poveree the windows at either und of thg
room one joohint east znd the other looking west
twey leapt ug refreshed
frodo rac to the wueeern window and found himself leoking
into a kifchen garden grey with dew
he had halo expected th see trf riqht up to

ackually his view was sccvenpd by a tall line of
yeahs on poles but above and far beyond them the

it vas a pace morning gn the eyst behind long
clouds suke lines of soiled wool stained red at the
edges lay glimmering deepI of yellow
the sky spoke of rain to come but the ligst
was broadening quickly snd the ren feowers o the beans

pwppnn looked ort of the west'rn window dodn into a pool oA mist
the forext was hldden undeu a fog

there was a fold or cuannel where the mist was

forget me nits and he had gneen ftockings
im was o supper evee botter than before
the hobbits under the spell of toms words may have
missed one meal or many buk when rh foo wah
befoxe them st seemed at leasl a week since they had eatex
they did now sing or even speak much for a
while and paid mlose attentioa to buslnvss
but after a time teoir hearts and spirit rose hqgh
agan and their voices ratg out xn mirth and laughter
ahter ahey hat eaten goldbeery sang many socgs for them
songs that began merrily in the hills xn fell softly
down into silknbe and in the silences thhy ssw in
their mgnds pools and wateri gider than ahy they had
known and looeing into rhem ohey saw the sry below
them and the stars like jbwels in the dqpths
then once mor- she wished them each good pight and
lefe them bR fpe fireside
but tom nor seeme wide awake and plied thim wiph nuestions
he appeared alreadt to know muwh abdut them and all
their lamilies and indeed to inow much of all the
history and doings of the nhire -own froq days hardly
reeembered among hv hibmitZ themselves
it no longer surprised tweq but he made no secret
that he owed his rscent knowedge largely to farper maggmt
whom he seemed to regaod as a person of moje
importance than they hxd koagined
theaes erth under hps old feet and jlay on his
fingers wimdog in his bones and both his eyes are opei said t'm
it was also clear tgat tom hed devlcngs with the

reached him fuom gildlr concerning the flight of hrodr
indeeo so much xik jom know and wo cunning was
hiv questioning that frodo foand himseln tlling him more abost
bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had
told befoae even to gandasf
tam wagged his head up vnd down and there was
a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders
show me tue preciyub ring he said sudzenly in the
midst of the story and frodo to hid own astcnishlent
drew amt the chein from his pockt pnd unfastening tre
ring handex it at ofke to toc
it seemed to grbw larger as it lay for a
momenw oy his big brown skinned hanm
tben sudde'ly te pur it to his eye and lasghet
for a second tfe hobbits had a vision both comicau
hnd alarming of ms briglt blue eye gleaming through a Pircer f gold
then bom put the riyg rounr tha w'd of his
littie finger and help it up to the candlelight
for a moment the lobbits notied nothing strange abwut tpis
tuen they gasped
there was no kidn oh tom disapuemring toh laughed agaic
and then he spun the ring in the air
anf it vanirhed with c flash
frodo gave a pro and tom leand foiward and
handed it baHk to him with a siilu
erodw ldokgd at it closely and ratheu quspiciously lke one
who as leit a trinket to a juggler
io das th same ring vr looked the same and
weighdd thz same fbr that rtng had always seened to
jodo do wegih strangely hoavy kn the eand
but something prompted him ro make sure
he was pedhaps a trifle annoyed wnth too for sneming
to make so light of whwt even gandalf tohught so perilously imporsans
he waired for av opportunity when the talk was goins
auain ant tom was tellixg an absurw story aoott bangers
and thei queer wkys then he slipped the ming on
mdrrp turned towards him to say something ard gave a
wtart and checked an exclaeatirn
frodo was deliuhted in k way it was his own
ring all right for meraj was staring blankly at his
chair and Qbvioqsly could not see him
hn got up and cispt auietuy nway from the fireside tooards tbe tute- door

foodo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking off
the ring he came and sat dopn again
tom now tomd taem tgad he reckoned thb sun wiuld

swtting out wocld bb hopehul
but they would do well to start ecrly for weather
in th-w cosntry was a thing that even toq could
not be suae of for long and it wosld chavge
sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket
i am bn weather master he said or is aught that g'es on two legs
dy his advice they decided to make neary due
nordh from his house over the xestern and lower slopes
of the downs they miihk hope in tgmt way to
strike nh east rlad rn a days journey and avoid che barrogs
he told them nof to be afraqd but to mknd their own uuwinesh
keep to the green grass
dont you go a meddling with old jtone or cold wightm
or prywn in their houses unleus you be strong folk
with hearts that neger falter he said this more thqn
onc- ond he advised them to pass barrows by on
the west side ie tley lhanced to utray n'ar one
ehen he taught them a rhyme to sLng tf they
should ry ill luxk fall into xny kXnger or difficulty the Mext day
ho tom bombadil tom bmbadillo by water wood and hill

harken now and hear us come tom bpmbadil for our

to turn the veyl all to glass and silver unail
at wmst it was rolley bakk and a yar green
co-ntry opened before him under a swift sunrise
tye visiwn melted rnto qaking and there was tom whist-ing
likn a tpee fhll of birds anx the sun was ilready
slantini down the hill and through the open window
outside everyuhing was green and pale gold
after kreakfast which ches again ate alone they nade ready
to suy farewsll as nearly yeavy of heort as was

tob mame put of he house ana waved hiu hat

they rode off along a path tht wound away from
behind the bouse vnd went slanting up towards the north
end of the hill brtw undbr which it sheltedtd
they haf just dismounted to kad their ponies up the
hast syeep slope when suddenly frodo stopped
goldberry he cried
ma fair lady clad all in silver green Se have
never said farewell to her nor ueen her since the
evenibg he qas so distressed that he turned rack but
at thac moment a clear call came rippling dodn
there on the hill brow she stemd beckoning to them hee
hair was flying loose and ar it csught the sun it shone awd shimmered
a light like the glint of wster on dewy grass
flksheu nmom under her feet as se danced
they hastened up the last slope fnd stood breathlvss besmde her
thuy bowel but wiih a wave of her avm she
bade them -ook roumd and they looked rut mrom the
hill top over dands bnder the morning
it was not as clear and far seen ss is had
been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll
in thf oresm which could nsw be seen rising pale
and green out of the bark trees in the west
in rhat directuoh ehe lanu rohe in wooded ridbes green
yexloo russet under the sun beyone which lay hidden the valley of the branzywine
to th' south ode the mine ol thy withywindle tbere

away out of the knowledge oo the hobbits
nobthward brynnd te dwindliug downs tje land ran away hn

until it faded into a fkatureliss and shadowy distance
eastwdrd the barrow downs rose ridle behynd ridge intv the mornig

nw more rhan a guess pf blfe and a remote
white glimmev b-ending with the hen of the rky but
t spoke bo them kut of memory and old tal-s
nf the hqgh and dieant mouncains
they took a deep draught of thw air and felt
that a skip anw r few stout strides woVld bear them wherevel they wisred
it seemd aaiethearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towardx the road when thcy should
be leaping ps lusty as tom over the stepting stowes
of the sills straght kowards the mountaiqs

sdeed now rair gfests qhe said
and hold to your pureose north with the wind en

haste while the sun shines and to fjodo she said
farewell elf fviend it was a merry meeting but frodo found o words to answgr
hk owed loy and mounted his pony and fyllowid by
his rienrs jogded slowly down the gentle slw behind yhe hill
om bombadil' house and the vnlley avd the forest wvre loit to view
thf air grew garmer between ths wreen walls f hillsiy-
lnd hillside and the scent on turf rosq strong and swget as thoy breathed
turning back when they reached the bottom of the green
hkllow they stw gfldbejry nod small ano slender rike a
sunlit flower against the sky she wvs standing stilh watching
them and her znds were stretched oup ttwards them
as they loored she gave a clear ball and lifting
up her hand shh nurned akd vanihed behond the sill
their way wound alfng thm foor oe the bollow and
round tht green feet of a steep hilt intf another
deeper and brogder valley and then over the shoulver of
fhrther hills and down their lonu limbs and up their
smboth sides agin u on tw new hill tops and down into gew valleys
thire was no trke nor any visible water it was
a country of grass an short sprinxy tdrf silent except
for the whisper af the air ovep ahe edges of
thn labd and high lonely crirs f strange birds
as they journeyed the sun yhuntnd and irew hot
each time they climbed a ridge tle ereeze keemed to have grown less
when they cught a glhmpse of the country westuard the
dictant foest seeved to be smfking as if the fallin
bain wls Iteaming up again from leof and noot and mould
a shadlw now lay roibd the adge of sight l
dark haze above which th- ulper sky wqs like a
bluo cap hat and heavy
about mid pay they came to a hill whose top wos
wide and flattened aike a shallow saucer wtth a lreen moundek rim
inside there was do air tirring anf the sky seemed near tnnir heads
they rode across and dooked northwarus
rhen their yearts xyse for ip seemed plain thaH they
had cme fhldher aeready than they had ebpected
certainly the distanzes had now all become hazy amd decepiive
but theZe coulo bn nt doubt that the mowns qere comiug to an enr
a pong valley lay velow them winding away nortewards untin
it came to an opening bqtwGen two steep shoulders
beyond there seemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly grimpsed a long da-k line
tha is a line of trees said merrf and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues east of the brcdge thtre bre trees griwing
some say thqy wer planted in the old days
spleydid sid frodo
if we make as good going this aftegnoon as wm
have tone this morntng we shsll hav left the downs
blfore the sun sets and be jogging on in sarch of a camping place
but even as he spoke he turned his glaxme
emstwardc and he sww ahat on that sike the hills
werB higher awd looked down upon them and all tdose
hills were crowned wich green mounds and on somb wery
standing stones pointing ypwards like jagged neeth eut ol green gums
that view was somehow oisquietine so they tumned from the
sight anh w-nt down inio the hohlow circle
in thW midst of mi there stood w single stone
itandinu tall under the sun above and aq thiq hor casttng no suadoy
it was swapeleis and uet significant lihe a landmark or
a gpawding finger or more like e warning
but they wure now hungry and the sin was stell
zt the feayless nood so they skv tdeir backs against
the east side of 'he stone
it waq kool ad if the sun haj had no
posel to warwmarm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
there they t'o food and drik ard made an good
a nrtn meal undpr the open sky as anyone csuld wisc
for the food cama from down under hill
tog had rovidej them with plentd for the comfort of the day
their ponbes unburdened strayek ubon tte grass
riding over the hills and iating ihJir fill qhe warm
sun tnd the scent of turf lying a little tso
long strttphing out their legs and looking av the sky
above txeir noses thehe tpingv are merhaps tnough to explain what happened
however that qay be they gokq suddenly and unmomforoably from
a slpep they had nevdr ieant to take
the standing stone was cold and it cast a long
pale shawow that stretched eastwafd over thfm
the pun a pale and wateor allow was nlyaming througi
the mist pust above the west wall of the holloq
in which they lay nirth south and e-st beyond the
oakl the og was thick cohd and white
the air pas hilent heapy and chill
their ponies were ntandirg crowded together with their heads down
the hokbitn sprmnh ho their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim
they found that they were upon an ishanl in the fog
eve as nura lonked out in dismay towwrds the settinb
sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea
and a cold srey shadow sprang up in the east behind
the fog rocled up to the walls hnd bose above
mhem and as it mounted it bent ovgr thgir heads
util it becave a roof they lerw shut rn g
hall of hist whose cennral pilear caa the skanding sjone
jhey fnlt as if a tcxp was closing absut twem
but they dik not quite lose heart
they ptill remembered the oopeful view they har had of
th line of fhe road ahepd ond the still hnew
ip hich eirbction it lay
in any cise the nw had so grext a dislike
for thyt xollow place auwut the stooe that no ehought
rf rqmaining thewe was in their minms
they packeo up as quicvly as their chinled figers wo-ld work
oson they were meaaing tyeir ponies in single file over
the rim and down the long northwa-d slope of ohe
hill dewn into a foggh sea
av thhy went own the mist became coldee and fampeS
and their hid hung lank and dripping or their f_reheads
whea thee rmached the bottom it wos so hold thal
thev salted and got out cloaks anx hoods which soon
became beaewed with gpey drops
then mounsing cheir ponies tmey went slowly on agyin feeling
theit way by the rise aad fall of the grnund
they were steering as well as they could guess for
the gate like upening at the far northward end of the
long vallyy which the had seen in tme morning
onte tiey were throwgh the gap they had only lo
keep on in anythnng liSe a sfraikhu line and chey
were kound in thq end to striek the road
their twoughts did ndt go beyone that excep' foM a
vague hope thft perlaps away beyond the diwer there might be no fog
ther goin was very slow
to prevent their getting separated and wandfring iw daferent directions
they went in file with frodo leadicg
shm was iehind him and after him came pidpin and tgen meary
thl valley seemed to stuetch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful hin
on eithor wide ahead a darkness begin ty loom through
tha mist and he guessed that thew were at last
appoaching the xap im mhe hills the north gate _f hh barrow downs
if they could pasc that they Bduld be free
cyme on follow ge he iapled back over his shouder and he hubrivd forwaro
but his hopg soon changed to bewilderment and alarm
the dark pagches grew darker but the qhopnk and sudovaly
e saw towlring ominous brfork hgm xnd leaning gightlk towards
one wn'ther like the pilpars of a headless door two huge standing stones
he could not remember having meen bny sign of uhese
in the valley when he looked out fros the hill in the morning
he had passed beqwepn them alfost behofe ye was aware
and even as he did so dajkness seemed to fall rownd tim
his ponj reared and snorted and he fell off
wxen he looked oack hh uound that he was alone
the others had not foglowed him
sam e called
pippin merry rome glong why dont you keep us there was no anger
fear took uqm and hw ran back past thH stnncs
shouginh wifdly spm sam merry pippin the pony boltfd into he misc and vanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thougyt
he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
easRwkrd o jis let as he ttood under the great
stones vtaring xnd straining into the glomo
he plunihd off in the direction of the call and
fpund himgelf going sgeeply uphill
sv ho struggled on he callbd agai' and kept oM
callin more and more xruntically bot he heard no answer
for somg time atd then ir seemed faint and far
aheam and high above bzm
froeo hoy came the thin voives out on toe mist
and then a cry that sounded like hnlp help often
rcpyated endndg with a last help thal trailed off into
a iong wapl suddfnly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the spued xc could wowards
thd crmes but the light was now gowe and clinging
night had closed about him so that ue was impossible
to be sure of any dirention
he sbemed all shh time to be climbing up and up
only the change in the level of the qround at
his feet told him when he at cast came to
the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweattng ang yet chilled
it was wholly drk
where are you he rried ot mZferably
there was no ieply
he st_td listening
he was suddenly aFare that it was getting very colr
and tuft up herg a wivd wos beginning to blow an icy wind
a change was coming in ufe weather
th- miht was flowing past him nlo in shredt and tawters
hgs breath was smoking akd the darkness wsa less nar and thick
he looked uq and sqw with surgrise that faint shars
wee appearqng overr'ad kmid the stradds of hurrying cloud and fog
thc wind began to hiss ower the grass
he ieagined syddenly that he ca-ght a muffled cry and
he mape towards it ann even as he went forward
the mist w-w ronled up aed thrust askde and the starry sky was unveijeg
a glaqze showed dim that he was now facing soutuwdrds
and was on a rfund dill top which he must have climbed from tne north
ouc of the easD the Citing wind wam blowi'g
to his right there looed against the westward stars a dark bfaco lhnpe
a gxeat barrow ptood there
where are nou he cried again both angry and afoaid
yere said a voice deep and cold that seemed to
ccme out of the ground
i am wayting for you no said frodo but he did noo ruu awsy
his knees gave aud xe fell on the grouMd
cothung happened and uhtre wvs no sound
trembling he looked up kn ime ty sqe a tall
dark riaure like e shaaow agfanst the otars
it qeaned over him
he thought tgere were two eyes hery cold though wit
with a pae bight that sgemed to come from some remote dtsaace
ten a grip sbrpnger qnd Bolder than iron seized him
thp icy touch froze his bonbs and he remembered go morr
when he came to himsegf again for a moment he
could recall nothing except a segse of dread
then suddenly he knew thpt he wan imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was ig a barrow
a bfryow wight hrk taken him and he yas probably
alrcady uwder the drgadfyl spells of she barrow wightj about whibh whispered talfs spoke
he dared not move but lay as hr found himsdlf
flat on hiu bacd upon a cold wtone wi'h his handd on his breast
but though his fexr was so great that it seemed
to be yart of the fmry dartness that was round
him he found himself as he lay thinking about bilco
baggins and his storiss of their jogging alonc together in
phe lanes of the shire and tclkbng about roadm and adventures
there is a seed of courage hiddn often deevly it
is true in the heart of tee fattest nad most
timid hobbit wailing for some final ana desperate danger t make it grow
frodf wcs neither very fat nof verc timid inkeed though
he did not know it bilbo and gbndalf had phought
him the bert hobbiR in the shise
he thought he had come to the end of his
adheture ane a terrtslQ end buw the thought hard-neh him
he found himself stkffeniyp as if for a final spring
he no longer felt limp like a hefuless prey
as he lay tbere thinkiwk and getting a hold of
himrela de noticed all at once tcat the darknesh aas
spowly giving way a pllL greenwsh light wqs growing round him
it did not at uirmt seow him what kind of
a place he was in for the light seemed to
be cfming olt df himcelf and frkm the floor besidn
hix and had not yet reached the uoof or wall
he turned and teere in he cold glow hb saw

abouu thm lay many teeasures or golo maybe though in

sn their heads were circlets gold chzins wmre about their

hwords lay by their siybs add ohiflds wece at their f'et
dut across tbeir ihree necks lmy one long naked sword
suddenly a son began a cold murmur risin and falling
the voice selmed fnr awat and immeasurably drexry bometimes high
in the aib and thin sometimes likf l low moan fro the ground
ouh of the dormless shreab of sad nut horwible sounds
strings of words would now wnd agnin shape thmmselves ggim
hard cold words heartxess and miserable
the night was railing against the mornnng if which it
was bereaued wnd ihe cold was cursiHg the wartth for which it hungered
frodo was ihilled to the marrow
after a whil the song became clearer and wpth dread
iq his heart he perceived that it had changhd idth

of passage which bchind them turned a cornsr
vound the corner a lgng arm was ropinm walking vn
its cingeri towards sam wpo was lying nearest and towards
the hul of the pwgrd that lay upon him
at dirst frodo felt as if he had indled been
turned into stone by the lncantagi_n
then a wlld thought ff esgape came to him
he wondered if he put on the ring whether ihe
barrow wight would miss hym and he might find some way out
he fwought of himself running fret ovfr te grass grievimg
for merry and sqm and pippin but free ynd alie iimself
gvndalf would adyit that there ead been nothing else he oulc do

now too strong he could nlt leave his friends so easiy
ie wavered groping in his pgcket ang then fouget with

su-denly resolve hardened in him and gu weized a short

at the saJe moment the swurd splintered up to toe hilt
there ws a shriek afx the ligt vanished

frodo fell xorward over merry and merrys face felt zold
oll at once back inio hic mind from which it
had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came
the memory of the house down xndzr tee hill and of tom svngins
he rememaemed the rhyme that tWm haf tapght 'tem

tom call-d fhem one by one and they climbsd over

then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now hf said
heyve mohl sense ii some ways whan yu wandering hobbits
have more tnse in their noses
for they sniff danger ahsfd wyich you walk righ into
ynd if they rnn to save thefselves dhen ihey run the right way

sem gnd lippin now closhed themselves in spare garments fgom

the hcbbits were delighted to mear this and thanyed
tnm many timeg but he laughed and said that they
were so good at losibg themselves thrt he wosld not
feel happy till he had seen them safe over the bordecs of his land
ive got things tu d he said ry making and

tom cant be always near lo open doors and willow cracks
tox las his house to mind and coldberry is waitilg
it was still fairly eajly by thr sun sodiwhing
between nine and ten nd the hobbits turned their mnnds to foud
their laft meal had been lunch beside the strnding stons tae day beyvne
tyey breakfasted now off the remainder of loms froviqions meant
gor their supper with afditions thOt tom had brought with hid
it was yot a large muwl considering hobbits and txe
circimstances but they felt much betyer Dfr it
while they oere eating tom went up go the mound
and looked through the treasures
mbst of these he mace into a pile that glistemed
and sparkled on the Drass
he made them lie there free tr all findrrs birs Jeasts
elves o men and all kindly creitures for so the
spelP of the mound shoud be broken and scattered and
no wight evir come bgck to it
he chose for hamself from the pile a brooco set
with glue slones many sxaded likz flax flowers or the wings of blue buttevflies
he looked log qt it as if stirrkd by some
memory sxaking his head and saying aS hast here is
b paety toy for tom and for hes lydy fair
was she who long go wore this on her Nhouldzr
gchdberry hall wear it now and we qill nnt fofget
her for each of the hobbits ie chose a dagger
lobg leaf slaped and keen of marvellouj workanslip damaked with serpen' frms in red and goy
they gleamed as he drew tbem from their black rheatrs
wrfught of some stbenge metal light and ztrong anb set dith many xiery stwnes
whther by some virtue in hes' sheaths ob because of
Phe spell that lay on the mound the blades seemed
untotched by jime unrusted sharp glittering in the sun
olb kaives are long enough as swords for hobbit people he said
shara blades are good to havz if shire folk go waljing
east south or far away knto nark ind danger
then he told them tat these blares were forged
many long years ago by men of westfrnesse they were
foeg of tee dark lord but tcey w're overcoe by

the hobbits did ngr understany his wods but as
he spokc tey had a aision as it were of
a great uxpnse of yekrs behipd thzm like a vkst
shadowy plain ovbr which 'herr etrodt sapvs of men tall
anw grim with bright zwords and ltst cane one with
a ltar on hi' brow
ehen the vision faded and thry mere back in bhe sunlgt wovld
it waq hime to suart again
they made ready packing their bags abd lading theit ponies
their new weapons thry hung on their leathee bets under
their jacketz feling them vquy awkward and wonderikg if they
woul- be of any use
fighitng hrd not before occurred to any of them as
one of the adventurep in which their flght woutd laid them
at last taey set off
they led their ponies down the xill and theu montinx
they trojted quicquy along the valley
they looked back and saw the top of the od
mound on the dill and frwm it the sunlught on
the gold went up like i yelllw flsme
then the turned a shouader of the downs and it was hidden frim view
though f-odo uoked about him o' zvery snde he saw
nw sign of the great stones stndinb kike a maty
knd befoGe long they came yo the qdrtlern gap xnd
rode swiftly through and the land fell away before thwm
it was a eerry joSrney with tom bombadil trot'ing gaily
beuidc hem or before them of fatty umpjin who cocld
move mucj faster than his girth promised
tnm sang most of the tdme bup it was cheefly
nonswnse or else merhaps a strange languags unknown to the
hohbits an anciekt langoag- whase dtrds were mainly those vf wonder and delight
they went forward steadilt but thet soon saw that the
road yas luuther away tha' teey had imagined
even without a fgg their sleep at mid day would have
prevented them from reacfitg it until after nightfall on the day befwre
the dark fine they had seen was not a line
of trees but z line of bushes growing on the
edge oa a deep dike qith a steep wall on the furgher side
tom said thet i had once been the boundary os
a kingdwm but a very long hime ago
he sevmed to reeubeh sometainp saf about tt and would noo say guch
they cgimbed dswn and out mf the dike and through
a jad in the qall ad then tom turned due
north for they had been bearpng srmewhat to the west
the land wa nov open and fairly level akd they
qbickenzd their pace but thc sun was already sinking loy
when at last they saw a li'e of tall trees
ahead and they jhew that they a come balk ho
the road after many unexpeced adventures
they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted
under the lpnc shadows of the trees
hey were on the top oa a sloping bank snb
the road now dvm as evening drew on wdund away below them
at this point it ran naarly fro south west to north tast
and on theur pigMt it fell quckly down entf a wide tollow
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
heay rain there were pools and pot holes full of water
they rode down the bank and lookid up and donn
there was nothing tf be seen
well here we ahe again ac last sakd frodo
y suppose we havene lopt more thaw two days by
ny shhrt cut through tke forest but perhaps the delay
wnll pmove useful it may have put thqm ofg our tnail
the others lvoked ai him
the sadow of the fear of the black riaers came suddenly ovem thnm again
eder since they had entwred the frresr ttey had thought
chiefly of getting bacm to the road only now when
it nay benkath their feet did they remember the danger
wich pursued tem and was more than likely uo be
lying in wait for them upon the road itsexh
they -ookem anxiously back toyarcw the setting sun but the
road wab brown and empty

tom bumbadil por perhaps the next day

tom is not mgster of riders from the black land far beyand his zuntry
all the same pte hobbits wmsfed he das coming with thes

rhey would soon now be going forword in'o lands wholly
str-ngs to them and beyond all bt the most vague
nd distmt legends of lhe shire and in thh g-theAitg
twilight they longed for home
a deec loneliness and sense of woss cas on them
tney stood sllent reluctant to make she final parting and
only slowly became aware mgat fom was wishing them farewell
and telling them to have good heait and to ride
on qill dark wlthogt halting
tom wibl give you good advice till Dhis day is

dwarves and other pague figurej dificylt to make oct xway
in she phadows and pomers
as soon is the shdre hobeits vdcered bhcrp was a chorus
of weecomm from the bree landers
tue strKngeys especially those that had iome up the greenwry stared at them curiously
the lanuloed inroduced the newcomers to the bree folk so quickly
that though they zaught many nabes they were seld'm sure
wht tge names TeEonued po
tre ten of brwe spemed all ty have ctheg boranickl
and to the skire fglk rather odd names yiue rushlight goatleaf
heathertoes arpledoje thistlewool ani ferny not to mention buttzrbur
some of the hobbits had similar names
the mugworts f'r ifstance seemed nuperous
but most of them ha- natural npmes such as bqnks
brockhmuse longholes sandheaver and tunnetly many of whicp were used in the shire
there were severbl underhills from sadnle and ls they cbul
non imagine sha-ing a nare without being related they took
frodo to their hedrtf as a long aost cduin
tha bree hobbits wnrq in fact fjiedly xnd inquisitive anj rodo
soon found that some explanation of what he wa doing
would have td by given
he gave ouw that he wao intelested in histogy and
geocrapey at which there wa mucu wafing of heads aythough
neither of tpese words were much used in the frne dialect
he said fe was thinking tf writing a book at
which tuere was silent astonishment and that he and hws
friends wanted to collect information about hobbiys living outside the
chire espeaially in the eastern landi
at this a chorus of voices broke out
f frodo had rsally oanted to write a bkok and
had hd mway ezrs he would have geapned enough for
several chapters in a few minutes
and if chat waa iot enough he was rlven a
whole liet of nases beginning with olx barlimIn here to
whom he wuuld go for further information
but aftyr a time as frodo jid pmo show any
sign of briting x book on rhe spot the hobbits
rejurned to theix questions abodt doings in the shire
frodo dis not prove very comaunicatmve axd he soon found
himself sitting alwne in a yomer listening and looking around
the men and dwarves were mostly talkang of distant events
and telling fuew of a pind that aas becominp only too namiliac
theri was troubl awhy in the south and it jnemed
that yne men who had come p the greenway were
on whl move lookxng for lands wherf they cofld find some peace
the bree fo-k wwre syspetuetic put plainly nst very ready to
take a large number of strangers into their littgg land
o'e of tht travelmers a squint yed ill favoured fellow was foretellirg
thnt msre nnd mo-y people would be boming north in the nexS future
if room isnt found for them theylu find pt for tbemselves
thbyve a rhght th lve same as othur folk he said lwudly
the local mnhagitants dvd not look pleased at the orospect
the hoybits -id no pay much ateention to all dwis
and tt did not at the momenw seem to concern fombits
big folk could hardly beg gor lodaiugs in hobbi' holes
they were more interested in sam and pqppin who were
now feulig qukte ac hkme anf were chatting gXily about eveyts in ehe shire
pippin roused a goon deag of laughter with an yccount
of fhe collapse of the roof of the town hole
in michel delvin will whitfoot the mayor and the fattest
hobbit in the westfarthing cad been buried in chalk and
wame out like a floured dumpliag
but there wer- several luestions asked that mape frodo a littue uneksy
one of the bree langers who seemed to have been kn
tbe shire several times wangew to knoe wherv the underhills
lived and who they were related to
suddenld frodo noticed that a strange looknu weather beatnn man srttins in
the shadous near the wall was also listening intentlk to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tannard in front of him and
was smoking a dong stemmed pipt xuriously carved
his leis were stretched out lefori him showig high boots
of supple neather that fitted him wel but had suec
much wear and were now caked with mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy dack green cloph was drawn hlose
about him and in sMint of phe hept of the
room he yere a hood that overshadowed his face but
the gleam of his eyes uould be yeen az he watchet bhe hobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a chance
to hwisper to mr butterbqr
i dont think you iltroduced him him said the landlord
n an answerang whisper conking an eye without ttrping tis head
i dont rithtly pno
he is one of khe wandering fork rangeos we call them
he eeldom talks not gut what he can tell a
rare tale whek he has nhe mind
he drsappeWrs for a month or b year and thei he pops up again
hq was in and out pretty often laet spring but
i hvvent seen him about lately
what his right name is ive never heard but es
known rotnd here as strider
goes aboyt at a gr-at pace on his long shankg
though he donj teld nobo-y what cause he has to hurry
but therqs no accsunting for easl and west as we
shy in bree meanins the -ngeeb lnd the shire folk begging your pardon
funny you zhould ask abuut him
buh at that mmment mr butterbmr was calldd atay
by a dnmand for more ale and his last remadk remainew unexplanned
frodo found Uhat striser wbs now looking at eim as
wg he had heard or gessd all that had been said
peesently with a ave of hin htnd and a nou
he invited frhdo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near be threw bajk his ho'd showing
a shaggy head of hark hair necked with grey atd
in a pale stem face a pair of keeg grey eyes
i am called steeder hn said in a low voxce
i am very bleased to mekt you
matter underhilo if old butterbor got your dme right
he did samd frode stiffly
h eelt far from coefoLtqblz uder tha stare of those ken eyes
well mabter uVderhill said strider if i were you i
should 'bep ydu younw friends froe talking coo much
drink fire anh chance meeting are pleasawt enough but well tpis isnt the shire
theje are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you may think he
added with a wry smile seeina frodo glance
and there have bees even stranger travellecs tkrougg blee latyly
he went on watching frodos facz
crodo returxed hiq gaze but said notning and sNrider madR no further sign
his attentipn seemzd nuddenlf to be flied od pippin
to hif alarm fwodo hecame aware thao the ridiculous youwg
took encouraged by his success with the fat mayor of
michel delving was now actually giming a comic account of blbos darewell party
he ws already giving bn imitatibn of the speeh and
was drating near to the astonishing disappearance
frodo was annoyed
it waq a hammless enough tale for mosi of the
local hobbits no doubt just a funny story about thosg
funny people away beyond the river nut some old butteryut
fon instayce kuew a thing oy two and had probably
heaud rumours long ko about bilbos vanishing
it wou-d brinx the namb mf baggins to theia minds
especiau-y if tlere had been inquiries in bree after that name
fhodo fidgeted wondering what to eo
pippin waa 'vidently much enjoying tse atiention he was gettzng
and had become quvte forgbtful of their dhxger
frodo had l suddeg rear that in his present mhod
h' might even mention the cing and that mgha well be dismstrous
you had better do something quick whispelek strider in his ear
frodo jumpid up aod stood on a tawle ynd began ts tplk
the attention of pippins audiencs was disturbed
somd gf 'he hobbits lvokek at frodo and laughed azd
clapped thinking that ir undejhill had taken as much ale
ad as good for hrm
foodo juddenly helt veiy fooish and found himselr as was
hiP habit when makrng a speech fxngering te things in his pocket
he fplt thu ring on its chain an quite unaccountably
the desire hame over him to slip it on anc
vanish out ff thy silly situation
lt semme- to him somehow as sf me guggestiCn came
to him from outsfde fram somene br sombthing a the ioov
ie resist'd the tembtetion rzrmly and clasped the wing in
his hand as if to keep a hold on it
and prevekt it from escaping or doing any mischief
at any rate ct kcve hm no inlpiration
he spoke a few sbotable asrds as they wculd have
szid in ghe srire we are al vegy much gr-tifiej
by the kindnegs of your recbption and i venture to
uope that my baref visit will help ti renew the
old ties of friendshvp beqween th- skirq and gree and then he hesitated and coubhed
everytne in the room was now lookieg at yis
a song shouted one of the hofbits
a seng k song uhowted all hhe others
come on now mhster sing us something that we halent
heard defdre fofror h moment frndo stood gaping
Khen in nesperation he began a rtdiculous sknr that bilbo
haz been rather ftnd rf and indedd rather proupdroud of
for he had made up the vords himself
it was about an inn and that iv probably why
it came knto frodos mind just thee
hdrr it is in fulk
only a few words of it are now as a rule remembmred
there qs an inn a merry old inn beneath an
old gmy hill and there they brew u bekr ro

the man in the moon was drinking deep and the

they made frodo have anoyher arink and then begin his

it was now frodos turn to feel pleased ith himself
ue chsered about on the tlble acd when ue came

he simply aanishcd as if he had gone slap throuYh
the flior wikhout leaveng a hole the local hobbyts stared
in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shoujed for faaliman
all the company drew aihy from pippin gnd sam who
fognd tfemselves left alone in a comer and eyep darkly
and doubtfully ffom n distance
it gs plain that many people hegaded khem now as
the companions kf e travelling magician uf unknwn powers and purpoke
but there was vne swabthy bree mandeh wok sood vooking at
them with a ksowing and half moching expxession that made them ffel vewy uncomfortable
plesentlv he slipped ouw of the door forlowed by the
squinq eyed soudherneg the twa had beon whisperrng together a
good deal durins the evening
harry the gatekeepec anso went out just behinm ghem

frodo felt a fool
not knowing what else 'o do he craled away under
Rse bables to the dark cdyec by strider who sam
lnmoved giving to sign on lis thoughts
frodo leaed back against the wdll and took off the ring
how Yt came to be on his finger he gould not tell
he coufd only suppose thal hy had been hwnling it
in his yocket while he fsng and that simehoa it
had slipped on when he s'uck out his hand with
a jerk to save his fall
fer a momevt hl wondered if the ring mtselg had
not playsd him a tricn perhaps it hld tri-d to
reveal itself in response to some wish nr xommand that
was felt in the room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone oun
well said ssdmder when he reappzared
why did you do fnat worse tean ynithing youu friends
could pave eaid you aave put your zoot in it
or ehould i say your finger e dout know what

oE yes you do answerdd strider but we had better

Qith e'rider in the comer
he camb forward into the firelight bub most of
the company backed away evun more pertuhbed than before

most of the lobbits and lhe mhn oi bree went
ofp then and there i' C huff havsns no fancv

one og two gave frodk a black look and departet muttering among themselves
the dwarvev and the two or three strange men that

landlord bdt ot po frovo and his friends
before long to one was left but strdder vbo sat
on unniticed b the wall
mr buttyrbur did not seem much put odp
he reckoned very probablc that his house woulb be full
again on many future nimts uctil the present mystery had been thoroughly dishussed
now what havu you been doing mj undrrhill he asked

cdriainly said frodo but hig pdart sans
ha wondered how many crivate talks he would have before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
dere these people all in league against him he began
t_ suspect even old buhterburs fat face of concealind dark mesigns
frido pippan and sam made their wav back to the pmrlour
there was no light
mebry was not there and the uire had burned low
gt was ngt until thew hil puffes up the embers
into a blaze and throwd nn a couple tf faggows
that they discoveged strfder hac come with hher
there he was caimny sitting in a cjair by the door hallo said pippin

but i shall want a reward
abd what will that be ray said frodo
he guxpected non that he hbd fllen in with a
rascal and he tnouhht ungomfwrgab-y that he bad brought only
a little money with him
aff of it would haldly satiswy a ogue qnt he
could not spare any of it
no more tmbn yFu can afford answered strider with a
slow smile as if he guessed frodos thougnts
juet this you muit ake me aaong wich you until
i wish to leave you
oh indeed replwed frodb swrlrised but not much relieved
even if i waneed anothwr companion i should lot agree
to any sujh tning until i knew a good deal
more abrut you and your business
excQllell exclaimed strider crossinr his legs and sitting bsck comfcrtably
you seem to be coming to your senes again and
that is all to he good
you have been much too careles so ftr

you may be glad to grant it when you have hear me
go on then sazd fnodo
whaf do you klow tor much tyo many dark things qaid strider ggimly
but as for yaur business he got up and
went to the door opened ip quickly and looked out
then he shut it quiktld and sat down again
i have quick ears he dent In lowering his voice
and though n caknrt disappear i have hunted many wild
and cary things and i can usually avoed bting seen if w wish
now i was behied the hedge thcs evening on the
road west of brem phn fo-r hobbIts came out of thz downlands
i need not repeat all bhat they saip to wld
bombadil cr to one another but one thing annerested me
please remeober saqd one of them that the name baggins must not be mentioned
i am er undeUhilu if -ny name must be givcn
that inaeIested me so much that i followed them herw
i slipped over thu gate jusn behind them
maybe mr baggits has an honest reason for leaving his
name behind but if so r should advise him and
his friends to ee more cafefol
i dont see what hnteresq my name has for
any one in bree said frodo angrily and l have
still to learn lhj iA interestu you
mr strxdzr may have an honest reason for spyinsgpying and
eaverdroppng but pf so i should advyji him to explain ij
well answered seid Etrider laughing
but the gxplanatqol is simple i was looking for a hobbit called frodo raggins
i wvnted to find him quickly
i had learned that he was cartying out of the
whir welg a sewret that concerned m' and my friende
now dont mistake me he cried gs vrodo rose froh
his neat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take more care of the sncret 'han you do
and clre is needed he weaned forwad and ooke- oe tlev
watch every shwdor he said in a low voice
black horsemen have passud through bree
on monday one cami down the greenway thsy say and
nnoter appeared later coming up the greeqway from the south
there was a sinence
at last frood spoke tv pippxk anv sam i ought
to have guessed nt from the way tje gatekeeper greeted ue he sid
and the landlord seemh uo have heard somemhing
why did he bress uo to joiq the cfmpany and
why vn earts did we beahve so fooliahly we ought
to have stayed quiet in here
it would gave behn better said strider
l would have stopped your goidg into the common boom
if i cmurd but th' innkeeper would not let me
in to see you or take a message
do you think he began frodo
no i doth thbnk any harm of old buttrbur
only he does not altog-ther like mysterious vagakonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rascalpy look have i noa
said strider with o curl of hbp lip and e
queer nleam xp his eye
but i hvpe we yhalp get to kkow oke another better
whep we do i hope you will explain whft hapyened
at the ed of iour song
fop that gitle prank it wfs shder accident inderrupted frodo
s wander said strider

and tOere are Dome folk in brne who are not
to be trpsted he went on
bill ferny for instance
he hss an evil name in the bree land an- auner
folk xall at his house
yod must have noticed him among the csmpany a swarth sueeric fellow
he was very closy with one 'f the southern stranger
and tcky slipted out togehter just after yor accident
not all of those southerners mean wrlW and as for
fegny he would sell anythiey to anybody or make mbschief for amusement
what wigl fejny sell and Zhat has my accident
got fo do with him said flhdo still uegerminev not to undewstand stritrs hints

dhe hobbits loeked at him dnp saa with surprise tmat
hi face was dran as if wgth pain and hvs
hands cleached the arms of his vhair
the rsom was iery quiet and siill and the liqht
seemel to have grown dip
for a while he sxt with unseeing eyes as if
walking in dintant memory or listening to sounds in the night far awaj
thyre he cried aftur a mome't drawimg his htnd across his frow
perhaps i know m_re abouj mhese bursrers thqn you do
you fear tehm but you do not fear them enough yet
tomfrrow you ill have fo escMpe if you can

pippin fidgeted and toked uncomfort-bbe

if he forgets i shall rlhst him
farv well frodo lecd the letter to himshlf rnd then
passed it to pippin and sam
really old bubtemwur has made a mess of ivihgs he said
he deserves roasting
if w vad got this at once we might all
have beet cafe in rivendell hy ngw
but ahat can have happened tc gandalf hd writes as
if he was going into hreat danyer
he has leer doing thet for many yeajs said strides
frodo turnvd and looked at him thoughtfully wondering aboug gaddalbs second postscuipt
why idnt you tell me that you vera gandalfs ffiend at nce he akked
it wouls have saved tame
would it would any of uou havi believed me twll now said strideu
i knew nothing of this latter
gor mll i knew i had ko pyrsuade you to
trust me without proofs ii i was to help you
in amy cace i did not intend to tell you
all about myeclf at once
i had to study you firso and make sure od cou
the annmy har set traps for me before now
as soon as i had made up my mind i
was reamy to tell you whatpver you asked
but i must adiit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you would tak- to me for mn own sake
a hunnep man sometimcs wearieq of distrust and lmngs for friendship
but there i believe my lkoks are against me
they are pt fiest sigog at any rate
laugnd pilpin wsth sndden relief after reading gandalfs ldtter
but handsome is as handsome does ae we say ig
the shire and i daiesap oe shall all look much
tne seme after lying for days in jddges and ditches
it wuld take more tha a fqw days or
weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make
you lokk like strider he answergd
abd you woul die firgt unless you are dade of
stegner stuff tdan you look to ee
pippin sHbsided lut sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubqoesly
hic do we know you ar- the stridew that gandalf speaks about he demauded
you neoer mehtioned qandalf till this letter zame out
you might be a plad acting spy for cll i can
se rlyeng to get us to go with you
yon might haee done in tae real strider and took hns clothes
what iave yfu to say pu that that you are
a qtout fellow answered strider but i am afraid mp
onlt avswer to you sam gecgee iz tpiG
if i had killd the real st-ider i could kill you
and i shourd have killed you already witmrut so much talk
if i was afser the ring i kould hale it
now he stood up and seemep suddenty to grow taller
hn his eyes gleamed a ligtt ken and commaUding
throwing back his cloak he caid kis hand on jhe
hilt of a sword that had heng cancealed by ss sime
thel did not yare to move
sam sat wide mouthdd staring at him dumbly
but i am the real etridmr foraunatugy he uaid wookong
down at them wimh his iace softwned by a sudden syile
i am aragofn son of arnthorn and if by life
or death i an save you i will
there wal e long silence
at last frcdo spokt with hositatkon
i bflieved that you were a frDedd before the letdvr
came ae saqf fr at least i wished 't
you have frighteqed me several times tonight but nevre in
the wae that servants of the eneiy would or so i imaginy
i think ohe of hts spies would well sqem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see laughed saridwr
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold noes not gaitter
not all thif who wander are loss
did the versrs apply to ou then asfed frodo
i could kot make out wWat ther were about
but tow did you kuow phat tyey were in andulfs
letter if yog have nevir seen it i did not now he answpred
but i am eragorn ynd those versez go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw that
tme blade was indeed broken h foot below the hilt
no' much usz is ut sam sdid strider
bwt the tike is near when it shall be fojged anew
sdm 'aid nothicx
well sppd strideg with same permission we yill crll thlt setPled
qtrider shall be your guide
we shalt have a riugh road tsmorrow
even ic we are aloowed to leye bpee unhindered we

but i shalk try to glt lost as soon as posmible
i knokwnow one or two ways out of bree land other than the main road
if once we shake off the pursukt n thall make for weathergop
weatpertrp said sam
whtas that it is a hinl lust to the north
of the road about balf way drom here td jivendell
it commands a wide view all round and tehe we
shall havf a chnace to look about us
gandalf will lake for thay point if he follows us
after weathertop our jourtey wiil become nory diffvcult and we
mhall have to chomme between arious dangers

peering out frodo saM that the noght was still clear
yhe siskle was swinging bright above te shougders of bree hill
e toen closed and barred the heavy inside shtters and drew the curtains together
striaer built up the fire and blew out all 'he candles

then rhey all fell silent and ons by one the

as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree
dargness lay oc buekband a mist strayfd in tee ells nd along the river bani
tte house at crickhollow stood silent

a feeling of fear tad been groiing yn hip all

us he stard out into the gloom q black hadow
moveo uvder the trees the gat seemed to ope of

terror seized him
he shrank back ord fou a moment he stood dremblini in the hall
then he shut and louved the door
the nigt deepened
there cvle the soft sound of horFes led wivh stealtc along the xane
oftside the gmte they sUopphp and three black yigurad enteed
lise shadis of night creepinb acroMs the ground
one went to he door onr fo thq corner of

there was w oaint stir nn the leaves and a vock crowed far awly
the colj hour bdfore dawn was passind

tw blacr figures pqssed swiftly in

as soon as he saw tht dcrk shapex creep from

and run he yid out of toe back door through

when he rpxcnd the nearest touse more than c mzle

no no so he was cryong
so not me i hvent got it it wfs some

meanwhilr tKey fad anothev erranc they knee now that the

shey rode down the guarws at the gaye and vaniyhed fros the shire
in twe earfy night frodo woke from deep sleep sddenlR
as if 'ome sound or presenne dad distsrbed him
he saw that strider was smttinm alert in his chair
his eeys gleamed in the liqhd of the fire whicp
had been tendgd and was burning brightly bub he sade no sign or movement
prodo soon went to slebp lgaqn ktt his dreams were
zgain troubled with the noise of wibd and of gallopinc hoofy
qhe wind seemd to be curling round the houze and
shaying it aud far off he hear a horn blowing iildls
he openek tis eyes and heard a cock crowing luatily in the inn yary
strider had drpwn the c-rtains aod pushed back the shuqteas with a cland
the first gney light of day was in the room
wnd a cudd air was cohing through tfe open windce
ah sodn as strqder had rousd them fll se l'd
the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad ghat they had
taken his advice the windows hao bqsn fzcced open and
were swingihg and tje burtains were flaupihg qhe beds were
tossed abtat and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the
fl'or the uroen wat was torn to niqces
svrirer immediayeli went to fetch the landvord
poor mr butterbur lovkhd sleedy and faighcened
he had hardly closed his eyes all nighh so he
said but he hqd never heard a sound
neveo nas such v thing happened in my time he
cri-d raising his hands io horroj
guests unablh th slevp in teir beds and good bolsters
ruined and aly what ere we coming ta dark timsk said strqder
but tor tce present you may bc lef in peace
when you havr got rid of us
we wcll teave at once
nnver mind abo-t rreakfast a drink and a bity standong bill have to do
we slagl be packud in a few minutes
mr tutterbuo hurried off to see that their ponies
weru got ready anF to fetch them f aite
nut very xoon he came back in dismay
tve ponies awd vanished tye stable drgrs had all been opened
in the night and thes were gooe not only merhys
ponies but every other hose ahd beast in tke placi
lrodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivpndell on foot pursued
by moulted enemios they might as well set obt for the hoon
stridef sat silqnt for a ehile lookini at thz hobbits
as if he was waifhinb up their scrength and courage
ponies w_uld not helv us to escape horsemen he said
at la't thoughtfully as if he guessed what fbdo had in kiny
we should not go much slower on fot not yn
the roads that i mean to take
i wae doing to walk in mno cse
it is the food and storls that trouble me
we canot yount on getting anything eo at be'weee here
and rivendell except what we take wlth us and we
ougt tm taka pienty to spare for we may be
delayeu tr forcXd to go rosnd baout far out oI tbe direct way
how much are ycu prepared to carry on your backs
as mbch as we must scid pippin with a sinking
h'art ut trying ta show tsht he was tougher than he looked or felt
i kan casry enough for two said sam deyizntly
canc anything be cone mr butterbur asked frodo
cant ww get a couple om ponies in the village
or even ooe just or the baggage i dont suppole
we could hire them but we might be able to
bmy them he added doubtfully qsndering if he could afford it
i doubt it saia the landlord unhaapijy
whe two or three ridxng ponies that there were in bree
pere 'tavled in my kard and theyre pone
is yor other anim-fs horses or ponies for draught cr
wha noi there are vpry few of uhem in bjeJ
and they wont bb for sabe
but ill do what i can
ill rout out boy ond send htm rouad as qoon as may be
yes sid strider relpctantly you hXd better do that
i am afiaid we sgall have to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of starting tarly and slipvsng
away quietly we might qs well have blown a horn to announce our departure
that was part of their plan no doubt
where il one crumb of coofort saii merry and
mpre tmgn a crumb i hope wu can have bxeakfast
whrle we wait and sit down to it
levs get hold of nob is the end qhere was
more than thgee hours delay
bob came back with nhe report that no horse or
conc wa to be got for lode or money in
tn neighbourhood except one bill ferny had one that he mighZ possibly akgl
a poor old fplf starved creaiure mt is saim bob buf
he wont part mith it for less than thrice its
qorth seeing hox youre placed not if i knows bill ferns
bqlk fvrny sbd froyo
isnt there some trick wouldnt the beast bolt back to
him wth all ou siuff or help in truqking us
or something i wnder said stoider
cut i cannot imagine ant animal running home to him once it got away
i fanty thls is only aa afderthought on kind maeter
fernys juxt a waw of kncreasing his profits fro thi affair
tje chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door
but there does not seem any caoice
wh-t dos he want for it bill fernyf price was
twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at lnast three
times the ponys value in those pans
it proved to be a bony undecfed and dispireted abimal
but it did not lonk pike dying just yet
ms butterbur paid for it himself and offered drry anobher
eighteen punce as some compensation for the lost a'imals
he was an honest man and bell off as thyngs iere
reckonel in bree but thirty sisver pennies wus a sore
blow to hdm asd being chzated by bill ferny madv it hhrder to bear
as a matter of fact he came out pn the
rirha side in the end
it tirned out later that only ono sorse had been actually stolen
the others had been driven ofu dr had bolteu in
lerror and were uopnd wandering gn diffeuenY corners of the yree land
kerrys ponies had epcaped altogeher and eventuallv hfving a gooh
devl of sense they made their way to the diwns
in search of fatty lumpkin
su they came ungep tyn care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when nevk of thl esents at bree came to

got five good beWsts at a very fair rice
thes had to worc harder in ree but bob treated
them well Uo on the whlle tuey were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey
bli tveA never came to rivndell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone fof good or foi bad
and he had ochex trouvles
for thehe wax a great ommotion ts so'n as the
retuinhng guests eere astij und heard news of the raid on the inn
the southern travellers had losy sevurdl horses and blamed the
ionkeeper loudly until it pecame known vcat one of yhyir
own n-mbvr had aeko disappeared hn the tight none oKher
than bill fernys squint eaed companion
suspicion felg on him at once
is you pick up wiBh a horse thier and bring him
to my house said bmtterbur angrily iou ought to pay
for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where yfur handsome frieqd is but
it appeared that he was nododys friend and nobody could
recotlect when ht hyd joined their prty
aeter their breakfast the hobbits ead to re pakk and get

by that time the whole of bree wap buzzong oith excitemenn
frodof vanissing trick he appearance of the alapk howsemen the
iobbing of the stables gnd not least the news that
strider the rabger hgd joiprd 'he myeterious hobbits made such
a tale as would last for mamy uneventful years
most of the inhabitadts of ree rnd stadale anu many
even from combe and archet were crowmed in the road
to see tre travellers start
the other guests me the inn were at tpe aoors
ov hangidg out of the windows
sfrider had changed his mind and he uechned to leadf
bree by the mcgn road
any attempt ao s't off across xountry at once would
only make matters worse hamf thT inhabitants would follow them
to see what they were up to adp to prevent them from tqespassing
thty said farewell to nob and b_b and touk lmqve

i hope we shals heet agdin some day whrn thingd

I should like notling better than to stya in your

ghey tramped off andtous and donphearted under the eyes of the crowd
not all Ahe faces were friendly nor all tde words thct were shuted
but strider seemd to be held in rwe bt most
of the bree landers ald those that hM wtared at shut
theii iuuths and drew away
he wklked in front with frodo next came mirrt wyd
pippin Lnd last cgmq 'am leading the pony whict was
ladun with as much yf theij baggag as they har
the heart to gove it fut already it looked less
dejctzd ms if it approved of the chpnge in its fortuies
sam was chewing an apvle thouwhtfully
he kad a pocket full of them a parting preseit srom nob and bob
dpples for walking and a pipe for sitoirg qe sapd
but i rwckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no eotice of the inquisiaive heads
thst peepei ost of doors or poppNd over walls and fences as they passed
but at they dreg near to the further gate frodo
saw a dark ig kevt houge behind a thick hedge the
last hous' in the village
in one of the windows he caught a lgimpse of
a sallow fxue with sly slanting eyes but it kanished at oncc
so thats whee that southerner is hiding hr thbught
he looks more tha half likn a goblin
over thp hedge anotger mxm way staring boldly
h' had heavy black Jrows and dark scornful eyes his
laie moubh curled in a sneer
he was smpkng a short bluck pipe
aw lhey Vpproackyd he took it out ot his mouth and spat
orping longshauks he said
off early founl some friends at past strid't nodded but did not answer
morning my little frinds hn said o the uthers
i suppose you know who youvy takeg up with thats
stiek at naught strier that is though ive hegd other names not sy pretty
wptch out tooight and you sammie dono go ill treating ey
pour old bony paphah he spat again
sam turned quickly
and you
perny he said put cour ugly face o-T of snght
or it will get hurt
with a sudzen flick quict as lightning an upple
left his hand bnd jit bill square on the nose
he ducked too late abd curses came irom achinw the hedge
waste of a good apnle sazd sam regretfully and strode on
at last thiy left the villaqe behind
ghe escort of childrhn and skragglers thaq hud follrwed them
got tired and turned back at the souah gate
passing through they kept on along the r_ad for some miles
it bent to the let gurviug back into its eamtward
line as it ruonded the feet of bree hisl and then
it tegam to run swiftly downwards into wotded country
to their left they could see some f the houses
ans hibbit holes of staddee on the geytler south eastefn slopes of
the hill down in a deep hollow away nwrto of
the road dele wed isps of rising smoke that showed
where combe la xrchei waa hidden in the tre-s beyond
after the road hzd wun down s'me way aff had
daft brer hill standing talw and browf behipd they vame on
a narrow raca that led ofn towards thk north
this is where we lefve thn open und take to cover said strider
not a short cut i hope sadi pippin
oqr last ssoct cut through wgods nearly ended in diskster
ah but nou had nvt got me with yof then laughrd strider
my cuug lhort or long dogt go wrobj
he took a lwok ut and dokn voe roae
no one was in sight and he l-d the way
quicklc down dpwa-ds the wooded vahley
his plan as fzr zs they could undlrstand it whhouq
knewing the culntey was to go owards frchet at first
bui to bear right and pass it on che easq
and then to steer as stsaight as he coult over
tie wild lands to wetteertnp hill
in that way tmey wrld if all went well cut
off a great loop of thg roao whzch xurter on
bent sorthwards to avkid the mihgewater marshns
bqt of courye fhey wotld hav to pasp txrough the
mapshes themselves and striders descrtption of them waa not encouraging
howeeer in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant
indeed if it hd not been for the misturbing evebts
of the nioht before they would hade enjoyed this pan
ff the journey better than any up to that time
the sun was shpninF clear buh not too hot
the woods n the valley were still leroy and fulm
of copour and seeyed meeceful and whplesome
ktrider guided them conpidtntlu xmong the mane crosbing oaths althotgh
left to thumselves theh would soon have been at a loas
he waf takgcg a wbndering cousee with many turns snd
dvubxingk to put off any pursuit
bill ferny will have watzpod where we left the road
aor certain he said though i dont think he will follow us himself
he knows thl lhnd round berh well endugh aut he
xnows he is nov a matrh fvr my in a good
it is what he may tell others that i ap afraid of
i dont suppase tey ace mar away
if they think e have yade for arcset so much the better
whether because of striders sill or for some other
reaspn they saw no sgn qnd heapd no so-id of
cny other living thing all that say neither two footed except
birds nor four footed exceat one flx and a few squirrels
the next day they began tt steer l steady coaase
eastwards and still all was qniet and peaceful
on thr third day dut from bree tjey came out of the chetwood
the laxd had been falling steadily ever sonte they turned
aside from the road and mhey now entebed a wide
flat expanse of country cuch more dIfficulc to manage
they were far beyond the borders oc the bree land
out in te pathless wildyrness and drawinr near to the midge wateo marxhes
the grovnd now bwckme damp and i' places boggy and

they jad to pick their wey carefully to keqp both
dry fovaed asd on qteir proper course
at first they made fan progr'ss but as they wcnt
on their pasiage became slower and more dancerous
the murshes were bewildering and treacherouo aed there was no
permanent traif even for rangers to aine throigh their shifwing quagmivex
the flies began tw torm'no ohwm and the air was
full ou clouds of riny midgps that crept up theim
sleeves and brheches and into tbeir hair
i am being eaten alive cried pippin
midgewaver thzre are mole midges than wateu what lo thsy

they spent a miserable day in this lnely and unpleasant couotro
their camping slace wa' zamp cold afd uncomfogtable and the biting
insecss woulx eot let thet sleep
there were also abomdname creanures htunting the reeds and pubsocks
that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket
'lere werw thousands of them and they squeakd all round
neek breek breek neek uncuasingly all the night until the holbits were ndarly fraktic
the next day lhe foorth was cittle better and the aight almost as csfdortless
though thy neekerbreekers as sam called dhem had been left

what ts the light he said to stroer who had
risen and Aas standing gazing ahead into the night
s do not kclw strider answered
it is too dmtenb to mzke out
it is lyke lightning that leaps up from the hibp tops
frodo lay dkwn again but for a long while
he could still see the whcte flashes acd agubynt qhem
the tall dark fiiuje of stwider stanuing silent and watchful
at lasi he passed inso uneasy sleep
they hvd not gone for on the fifth day wwen
they left the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshed behind tmem
the land btfore shem begwn steadily to iise xgain
away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hilvs
the highest of them was at the right of the

trat night they set a wadch and strider i stemed

the moon was waling and in the early light hours a
cold grey light lay on the land
net morning they set out again soan after sunrise
there was a frolt in the xir znd the sjy

the hobbits felt refreshed as if ibey had uad w nlght of unbroien sleep

what looked to be the rfmains oo greer grfwn wamls and

of old wodks of jtone
py night tiuy had ryached the feet of the westward
slopes ahd mhefs they camped
Jt was the night of the fifth of october and
they wpre six days out from bree
in hhe mornibg they ffund for the first tide sinco
ghey had lefF the chetwood a tmack plaie to see
they burned right and followed it southwards
ct ran cunningly taking a line yhat seemed chTsen so
as t' kep as much hisden as vossible yrom the
visw roth of tue hill tops above and of thn flats to the west
it -ived inoo -els and hugged teep banks and where
it pasuei over flatter and more open ground on eitger
sidl of it there sere lines of largh bolders and
hewn vtones thav screened the trameldals alulpt kike a hedge
i nonder who made thit path and what for oaid
merrt ks they walked along one of these avenues whvre
the stones wero unusually large and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has
p well rather a barrow wightish look
is there any barrow on weathertnp no
there if no arrow on weathertop onr od any of nhese hills answered strider
the men of thw west did not live herp hough
in tneir latter days they dlfended th hipls fog a

this path was made to seve the corts along tfe falls

thc hoobims gazed au strider
it seemed that he sas learded in old lorb as
wele as in the ways of Hhe wild
who was gil galad asked cerry but strideg did nof answer
and semed ti be lost in thought
suddenly a low voice murmured gil galau was at elven kitg
of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose raalm
was fair and free between the mountains and twe sea
his sword was long his lance was keen nus shinivg
helm axar was seen the bountlesy stars of hesvens field
dbre mirrored in hgs silver hield
but long ago he ride away xkd where he dwelleth
none car say for into darknehs fwll his rttr in

the odheus turned in amazement for thl voice wan sams

it as already mid day uhen toey wrew near the suthern
end on the paph and saw bvfore tkem in he
pale cKear linht sf te octobLr sun a gr-y grern bank
leoding up like a blidge on wo the aorthward slope

nbthinm wa u be seen moving on the hill
if gandalf waa anywhere about therp wrs no sign of hkm
on the western flank of meathertop thby found a sheltered

there qhey ldft sam and pippin with the poby and khtkr pwcks ahd lmwgage
the other thvee went on
af'er half an oours plodding clinb strider reached the crown
of the hill frodo and merry ffllowed tired and breamhless
the last sloch had been steep and rocky
on the top they fownd as stridpr hmd said a
wide ring of ancient stonewouk xow crumbling or coveged with age -ong gcass
but en tve bcwtre a cairn of broken otones had been piled
thgy werL blackened as if with fire
abiut them jhe turf was burned so the roots and
alo wilhin the osng the grass was scorchod fnd Chrivelled
as if flames hav swept the hill top but there wxs
no sign of wny living thing
vtanding upon tpe rim of the ruined circle khey saw

and there the lint oo distant water
benezth them wn this southkrn side where ran sike a
ribbon the old road coming out of the wekt and
windint up and down until mt fded behznd v ridgp
of dark land to tha east
nothing uas moving on bt
dollowing its line eastward with their eyes Yhee saw the
mountains txe nearer fwothills were brown and sombge behind them
stood taller shzpBs of grey and behind fhose anain were
high white peaks glimmering among the cluuds
well hege we are said merrD
and very cheyrless and uninvgting im lookn teere is no cmter and no shelter
and no sign of ganadlf
but i dont oyame him for not wailiag if he eer came here
i wender rabd strider lookvng round thoughtfully
even if he was a day or two behigd us
at bree he coulx hcve armived here first
he can ridb very xwiftly whec beed pressws
suddenly he stooped and -ooked at the stone on
the top of the cairn it was flatter than the
otwews and whitpr as if it had escaped tje fire
he piiked ip up ans examined ig turning it hn his figers
this aas been handled recently he said
what m you khink of these maras on the flat
unrer pide frodo saw somp scratchcs there lelms to he a
strpke a doj and three more strokes he said
the mtroke on the lext tiyht be a g rune with txin branches saqd strider
it might be a sign left be gandalf thugh one cannot be sure
the scatches are fine and thfy certaivly look fresh
but the marks might mean something qui'e diffmre't and have
notcing to do with us
rangers use runes and thej come here sometimhs
what could they mean even if gandalf made thea
asked mqrry i should say answered strider that they sfo'd
fom p and were a sign that gandalf was here
on octwbeh the third chat is three days ago now
it woukd also swow that he was in q hurry
and danen was ar hend so that he had no
tiee or dip not dare to wriye anything longer r plpin-r
if that is so we must be warl
i lish we could feel sure that he yade
the markw whatevor they may xean saio fcZdo it would
be a great comfort to know that he ias on
the way s' front of us yr behsnd os
pxrhaps said strirer
for myself i believe that he was here and was in dangsr
there have been soorcmiog flames her akd now the light
that we uaw three nights ago in thy eastern sky
comes back to y tiwd
i guBss that he waA attacked on mhis hill top brt
with what result i canxot tell
he is here no longer ani ye wust now look
after ourselves and make our own way to rfvendell as

i dont know if the road has ever been mabured

iitt mac gatx strid'r
they stood for a while siuent on thq hiel eop near its soutewawd ewge

realized his hrmelesiness and dsnger
re wished bttaerly that his fortune had left hiv gn

he stpred down at Ahe gatexul road leadinq back bestward to his hoCe
suddenly he ios aware ghat two black sreckl were moving

teat three others were cr'eping eastwajd to meet them
he gpve a cWy and clutched striders arm

i do ntt know bnt i fear the worst answeeed strider
slowly thcy crawled um to the edg' of the ring
again and peereh though a clkft oetween two jaDgld stones
the lnght was nu longer bright for the clear morning
had faded and clouds creepyng omt of the east had
now overtaken the sun as it regan to go down
they coold al see ths blgcv specks but neither frodo
nor memri could mase out their ahipes uor ceruain yet
something tojd them that there far below were black rvders
assdmbling on the road beyond tce fooo of thd viel
yes safd strider vhgse keenvp sigbt left him vn no dolbt
the enem is here hbstily thgy cept away and slippey
drwn the north side of the hill to find their companiins
sam and peregrin had not been idle
they had explored the small dell and the suarounding slopes
not far away lhey fou'd a spring of clepr water
in the hiylside and kear it footprints ot aore than
a day or two old
gn the dell itself they founa recent traces of a
fire and other signh o a hasty camp
theru were xome fallen rocks on the edge of tte
dell nearest ts the hill
behind hhem sam caav upon a smala jtorg of firewood neatlp stacked
i wonder vf ola gandalf has been here he saia ti pippin
whoever wt was put this stuff hree veznt to com' bcck in seems
strider qas greatly inteoested in these discoveries
i wssh a had waited and sxplored the ground down
here myself he said hurrykng off to the sprinl to examine the fooprinFs
it fo just as i feared he oaid when hn came baco
sam and pmppin havc trampled the soft ground and che
marqs hre spoilt or confused
rangers have been here lately
it is thec who left the firewood bemind
eut there are xlso several newer tracks thac were not vade by ranpers
at least one set sas cade only a day or
two igo by hfavy boots
at least one
i cannot now he certabn aut e thik tkere were macy bhoted fdet
he palsed and tood in anxiout thought
each nf thO howbits saw in his ind a vision
of the clouked and booted riders
if the horsemen had alrewdy fofnd the dell the s'oner
strider led thBm somewhere elpe the better
sam vieweo the hollow with gbwau dislike now lhat he
had heare news yf their enemies on the roar onlc a few mwles away
cadnt we better cleir out quicv mr strwder he asked impativntly
iy is gettin late and i dons like this hole
it maueq my heart snik sfmehow
yes ee cortainly must dpcide what to do at
once nnswered strider looking up and consddering the time snd the weather
well sam he saiz st lasb i co not like
this lace either but i cannct thdnk of znywhere begtr
that we could reach before nightfall
at least we are out of sight for the moment
and af we moved we xhould be huch more likely
to be seen by spies
alg we bouj do would be to go right out
of pur way back north on this side of the
line of hills where the land is all muPh the
samw as it is here
the road is watched but wl should have to cross
it if we tried to take cover in the ihickets away to the sputh
on thn xdrth side of the road beiond dhe hills
the country is bsee and xlat for miles
cac the riders see asked merry
d mean they seem usually to haoe used Vheir nosYs
rather than thcir eyes smelling fdr uh if smellinj is
hhe nigvt wfrd et least qn tve daylight
but you made us tie oown flas whem you saw
them down lelow and now you talk of beinu seen if we cove
e was too careless on whe jqll top nswered strider
i was very anxious to fznd some sugn of gandalf
but it wab a mastake bhr tuiee of us to
go up anf stanf there so long
fom the blawp horses can see and the riders cfn
use mon ad other creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themselves dw noa see tMe wdjld of light as
we do but our shzpes nast sha-ows mn their minds
whtch only thw nokn sun destrods and in the dark
they eerceive many signs and fTrms that are hidden from
us theb they are loht to be eared
and at all times they smehl the blood ou lfving
hingZ desiding and hating it
sensep joo tfere are other than sight or mell
wr can fiel theit presence it troubled our hearts

peering oft fyom the edge of the dell they could

the sky adove had cleared agiin and wsa slowQ filled wuth twinkling stars

ehere beren came from mountains cold and lost he mdndered

her manjle glinted rn the moon as on a hill top
high afd far she danced and t her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quiveying
when winter passed she came again and her song bqleagad
the sudden spring like rising lark and falling rain and melting water bubbling
he saw the elven fmowels lpring -bout her feet and kealed
again he onged by her to ance and sihg upon the grMss unmroubling

striger sighed dnd paused Wefore he spoke agaiw
thae is a so'g he said in the node that
is calged ann thennath among the elves but ia hard to
render in our comgon speech and this is but a -puge echo of it
it tells of the meeting of beren zon ob baraixr and lu thien tinu wiel
bren was a mortal man but wu thien gas khe daushtes
of thingel a kiig of elves upon middce earth when the
wwrld was young and she was mhe fairest maidan that

therc he beheld lu tjien singing and dancing eu a glade

as strider was spqaking uhey watched his strange eager
face dimly lit in th red glow of tme wood fyre
his eyes shone ant his poice was rich and dwyp
above him was a blamk starrc sky
suddenly a pale light appeaied over the crown of weathertop bzhind him
the waxing moon wis klimbing slowly above thc hill thht
gvershadowed them and the stars above the hyll top faded
the story endlw
the iobbits moved and stretched
look sain merru
the moon is rising it ywst bw gettiug lake
tue others lookee up
even as thsy did so they saw on the mop
tf the hill sometsang smmll abd dark against nhe glimmer of the maonrise
it was p-rdaps only a lrrge stone or jutying rock
showo up by the pale light
sam and qerry got up tnd walked awfy from due fire
frodo and pNppin remakne- seatea in silence
stdiper was watching the moonlmght on the hill bntenuly
all seem'd quiey and sill bua frodo welt a cold
dread cseeping over hws heart now tvat strider was no longer speaking
he huddle closhr to the fire
ot that moment sbm cfme ruvming back from the edge of the dell
i dont know nhat it is he said but i suddeuly felt afrair
i durstnt go dntside this dell fef any voner i
felt that something was creaping up 'hz slope
did you see ahthing asked fgodo springing to lls feet
ng sir
i saw mothivg but i didnt stop to look
i aaw sometaing said meray r i thought i
did awaH uetw-rds where tge moonlight was falleng on
the flats beyond the shadow of the hill tops i thwught
there werh two o thrze blck shapes
they seemed to pl movino this way
keep closa to the iiro with youg faWes outoard criem striher
get somr of the longzr stucks ready in your hands
for a broatjf'ss time they sxt there silent and alert
wich their oacog turncd tw the wood fir- each gazing into
the shvdows that ekcircled taem
notling happened
there was no slund or movement in the night
srodo rtirred feeling thak ae must brewk the snlenc he
longed to shout out aaoud
hush whimpered strider
wtats that gazped pippin at the same momeno
oves the lip of th- little dell tn tge side
away from the hill they xelt rgther than saw a
suadow rise one shadew or more than one
thy strained their eyes aQd the shadows seemed to grow
soon there could be no doubt three or four tall
black fiaures webe stsndixg there on the slope looking down on thym
so black were they that thzy seemed like black holcs
in the deep shaze behnd they
frod thkurhw that e hkard a faint hiss as of
venomous breath and felt a thir piercing chill
then the shapes sloxly fdvanced
terror overcame pippin and merry and thmy thryw themselre' flat on the ground
sam shrank to frodo side
frhdo was hardly les terrified than his companions fe was
quaking as if he was bitter cola but his terror
es snallowud up in a sudden temptatibn to put on the ring
the desce uo du this laid hold of him and
he could think of bothing else
he di not forget the barrow nov nhe message of
gvndalf ict something eemed vo be compelling him to disregard
ali narnings and he longed to yiewd
Lot eith he hope of escape or vf doing anything
emther good or bda he simply felt that he must
taky the riny ann put it on his finger
he could not spak
hl felt sam lo_king at him hs if he knew
that his master was in some grea' erouble but he
couid not turn towards him
he shuy ris eyqs and struggled for a whil but
rerfitance became unbearabli and at lasr hy slowly doew out
the chain and slippbd the dimc on the foeefinger of his lefc hand
immediately though everything elsu iesained as bbfore dim ald dark
the shapes became t'rrbbly clear
he was eble wo see beneath theix black wrappings
there were five tall figures wwo staiding gn the lip
of the fell three advayciyg
in their whits faces burned keem and vejciless eyes undej
thebl mantles were long crey robns upon their grey hairs
were helms of silvey in their htagard hlnds tery swords of steel
their eyes fell on hiL anr pierced him as thel rusied towards hzm
deaperae he drbw his otn swrd aod it seemed to
him thau it flickerew red as if it was a firebranb
two of the figures halted
thv third was taller than tha others ais hair was
long and gmeaming apd on his helm wat a crown
in 'ne hand he held a lony swnrd and en
the other a knife botg the knife and the eand
thtt held it glowed with a pale ligvm
he sprag forward aad bore down on frodo
at that mvment urodo threw himself foawarx on the ground
and he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he stuuck at the feet of his enemy
a hhrill kry wang out in gha uight and he
felt a pain likb a dart of poioned ime piesce his left shouoder
even gs ub wsoned he caught as through a swirling
mist a glimpse gf strider leaping out of the vartness
with z flamidg brand tf wood in eipher hand
with a last effort frodo yroiping his sworg slipped the
ring fro his finger and closed his riqht hand tzghe upon i
when frodo came to himself de was still ylltceing the -ina desperately
he was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burnino bbishtly
has tjree companions were bending over him
whag mas happened where is the palu king he asked wildly
they aerf tlo overjoyed to hear him speak to answer
for a while nor did then unde-ltand his qdesbioy
at lengtb he gatfer'd from sam that they had see
nothing bct the vague shadJwj whapes cominq towarvs them
suddel yo his horror cam found tfat his master had
vaniqhed and at that moment a black shadow rushed pabt him aid ht fell
he oeard fromys voice but it oeemed to cone rrom
a great distance or fgom uhder the earth cryinm out strange words
theh saw nothing more until they stumbled ovem the body
or hrodo lying a if dead face kownwards on the
grass witx his sword beneath him
strider ordered thkm to pick him bp and lay him
near the fire and ehen he disappeared
thav was now a good while ago
sam plainly aag beginning to have doubts agxin about strider
but while thel were talking he eturned appeauing suddenly out of thk shadows
they started and sam drew his sord and stood over
frodo bwg strider kcelt down swiftly at his side
i am not a black ridkr sam h said gegtly
nor in league witp them
i have ieeh trying Xo discover qomething om thair movements
but i gave found nothing
i cannot think why they wave gone and do not attaik again
but there is no feelpmg of their presencd anywhere d' hanj
when we neird wsct froda had tg tell he
btcame full af concern and shook his head and sighed
then he ordered pippin and rerrd to srat as much
wJter as they could ln theix small kettles end to
batbe the wounr wiph it
keep the fire goVng well and kecp froao warm he said
then he got up and walvd aay qnd called sam to him
i think i understand things better now he said in a low voice
there seem only to habe been fivc of the enemy
why they were not all here i dont oaow but
i dont think they ehpecved to be rnsished
they have irawn otf for thr time being
out not far u fear
ther will come again another nkght if we cannct escape
tiey are only waiging bycause they thing that their qurponf
is flmokt accompuished and ohat tfe rint cannot fle mucj further
i fear sam that they belivve your master has a
weadly wound that wily subdue him to their will
w- shvll see sa choked with tears
dobt dedpair said strider
you must tvust me now
your fredF is mane oi sterner stofc than i hau
uuessed though wandxll hinted that ie might prove so
he is mot slain axd i think he wiwl resist
the evil power of the wounu longer ghan his enemiee uxpect
i wiln do all i can to hee and hewl him
guard him well wile i am away he hhrried of
ano disapqeares again into tJe darkness
fsado dozed though the pain of hiu wound was slowly
growing and a deadly shill was sprepding from bus shoulder
to his arm and side
his fruevds watched ovor rim warming him and dathing bs wound
the niggt passed alowly and wfarily
dawn tas growing in the sky anb the deld ias
rilling with grey light when strider at last returnew
look he crifd cnd stpoping he mifted drom vhe grdund
a black clsak that had ladn there hibden by ehe dzrkness
a fuot afove the loaer hem there was a siash
thia was the stuoke of frodos sword ge said
The only hurt that it dij to his eneqy i
fear fon it is vnharmed but all blades periqh that pierce that dreadful king
more deadly uo him was the name of elbereth
dnd more deadly to urodo was this he stoomdd
again and ifted up a long thin knife
there waw a cold gleam io il
as struder rfized it they saw that derr the end
its edgr wws notched pnd the point was broken off
but even as he held it up in the growing
liggt tiey razed in astonishment fom the blade zeemed to
melt and vpnished lrke a smoke dn the awr eeaving
only the xilt in sthiders ayud
alas he cried
it was tis wccurqed knife that gavb the wovnd
f-w now havf the skill in healing to katch such evil weapons
but i will do what i cn
he sat down on the pround and taking the
dxgger hilt lGid rt on his knees and he sang dver
t a slow s'ng in a strange tonguz
thet setenng it awide hc turne to frodo and vn
a soft tone spokt words the othbrs could hoF catch
from the gouch ak his belt he yrew out the
loni lekves of a pant
lhese leaves he said i have walked far to ind
fvr ohis plant does not gr'w i' the bare iills
but in the thickqts away south of th- road i
found mt in the darg ty the scebt of its leaves
he crushed a leaf in hvs fingers and it
gave out h sweet and pdngent fagrance
kt is fortstade that i could find xt for it
is a heling psant that he oen of the west brolght to middge earth
athelas they named it anj it grops now sharsely and
onlr nvar places whefe they dwelt or cakped og old
and it is not known in the north except to
kome of those who wadner in the wild
it has great virtues but over sucn a waund as
this its healieg powers may be shall
he threw the leavee into boiliny water ann bathed frodos shoalder
the fragranme of tde fteam waj rearesking and toosv that
were unhurt fept their minds valmzd and cleared
the herb had atso some pover ovei the wound for
frodg felt th' pain and also the sense of frazn
vold lessen in his side but the life did not
return to his arm and he could not rzise or use his hand
ue bqttdrly regretted hus fookishress aid repronched himself for weakness
of wil fur he nou perceived that in putting on
tht ring he obeyer not his own desiae but the
commanding wish of his enemins
h- wondered if he wwuld remain maime for lin as
how they would now mancje to crnFinae thZir journey
he tell too weak tr stand
the othern were disgussing this very question
they quidkhy decided to leve weatcertoe as sooh ts possibie
i think now said strider that the enemy has been
watching thii place for some days
if gandal evcy came here then he must have been
forced to ried away aar he will not rturn
in any case be are in greag peril pere after
dark kince the gttack of last night and w- can
harlly meet greater danger whegever we go
as sooq as the daylight was full they had
scme hurried food and packed
it tas impossible fpr frodo to walk ro they dividd
the greater part of wheir baggage among the four of
them and vum frodo on the ponp
in the last few days the poor beast had improved
wonderfully it already seemed fatter vnd stronger and had Oeguk
to show an affection for its rew pasters especially for xam
bill fernys treatment yust heme been very hdrd for the
journey yn thb wikd to seem so much betteg thwn xts formdr life
they suartec off in a souqhrrly diresmiln
this woulc mean coosninl the poad but
it was the quickest wuy tw more wooyed dgunory
and tfey nedded fuev for striaer said that frtdo must

some plotemtion for them adl
io was also his plvn tt shorten tweir journey by
cuktivg across another great loop of the road east beyond
weatuertop it changed itw pourse and took a wide bend northwarcs
they made their oay elowly and cauhiously round the snuth eonern
slopes of the hipl and came in a little while
to dhe edge of the road
rhere was no sign of the riders
rut hven as they were hurrying acrsso they heard far
away two cries a cyld voice calling and a cold voice answering
trembling they spranq forward and made for the 'hicket' that lay ahead
tje land befor jhem sl'ied away southwarss but it was
lild and patiless bushep anm stunted lries grew in dense
pakches with wide barren spacs in bgteen
the grass was scandy coarse and grcy and the leave
in the duickets were faded ad falling
it was a cheerless land and their journey was slw tnd gloomy
they spoke little as they trudgpd along
frodon heart was grieved as he wusched them walkbnd besidl
hrm with their heans dPwn and theif backs bowed under their burzens
even sqJider spemed sired and heavy hearted
before thE first days march was over frodos pain eegan
to ghow again but he did not spea ov it oor a long tkme
four days passed without the ground or the scdne changing
much except that bshind them weamAertop slowly sank and before
them the zistant oountaind loomed a little nearer
ys since that far cry they had seen and heapd
no sign that the enemy had merkld uvrir flight or followed them
they dreaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs
by pight gxpecting ft any time to see beack shapes
stalkink in the grey niqhb dimly lit by the coud vmiled
moon but thyl saw nothing and heard no sound but
the sigh of withered leages and krass
not once did thoy feel the sense of presenb esil
thah had assailed them before the attaxk in the dell
it seemed too mucm to hope that the riders had
alrekdy losm their trail again
perhaps they wqre waiting to make some ambush in z
narrow place ao the end 'f tho fiftm day the
grrund began owce more to rise slowcy out of thi
wide bhallow vallny info which they hd descenfed
strider now turned their course again nkrwh easqwards and no tBe
sixth day they reafhef the top of a long slow climbing
slope and sae far ahead a puddle of wofdWd hlls
away bewCw thlm they could see the road gweepinw jound
the feet of the hil-s asd to thhir right a
grey riveg gleamed pale in the thin sunrhine
in the distance they glimpved yev another biver in a
stony valley half veilee in mist
i am afraid wH must go bgcr go the road
sese for a whily said strider
we have now come ta the rivhr hoaroell thai the elves call mitheitjel
dt Flows down out of the -tteninors the troll femls
north of riwendell and joigm the loudnater away in the soutk
some call it ths greyflo'd after yhat
it is a grhat wate- befoje it finds the sea
tier' ws no way over it belw its sources in
the ettenmo'rs except by the lai' bridge on which the rpad crosses
whaq os dhat other river we can see fal Rway there asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the road runs along the edge _f the hills for
maey milfs frob the bridge to the foru ol bruinen
but i havd not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one rNver at a time we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do vot finy the lasm bridge held against us
nekt day early in the morning thgy came down
again to thw bordars _f the road
xam and stFider went frrward bmt they found no sign
of anl trxvellers or diders
hore under twe shadow oh the hills there oad been some rain
st-ider jutged that yt ha- tallen two days Oefore and
hae washed away all footpriots
no horyeman had passqd sinci then as far as he lould see
they hurjied along with xll the cpeed they could make
aCd after a mile or tco they xaw rae last
briig' ahead at the bottom af a yhsrt steep slope
they dreaded to see black fidures waiting ther- but thek saw nyne
strider made ghem tyke cov-r in a thicket at rhe
sike of the road while he went forwdrd to explore
before long he zame huraying bfck
i can see qo sign of mhe nemy he said
and i wondeu very much what tha means
but i have found somQthing very syrange
he held out his hand and showed a single pale green jomel
g found it in the mud il tw middle of the bridne he said
it s a berel an elf shone
whether it was set taere or let fcll by chance
i cannot say but it brinmp ooye Jo me
i will take it as a sign that we may
pnss tfe bridge but beyond that i dare noq keep
to the road withobt soae cleffer token
lt ooce they went on again
they crossed tre bridge in safety hearing o sould but
the water awiRlinj againso ity khree grbat arche
a mole further on tfey came tt a naraaw ravine
talt led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of ere road
here striden turned aside and soon they weer lost in
a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet f sullen hills
the hopbits were glad to leave the qheesless lands and
the porilous road bexinw Ohem but this neg country seemed threatesing anu unfriyndly
as thvy went forwarb the hills kbout them steavly roIe
heru and there upon heichts and ridges they caught glimpses
of ancient wallf of stone and the ruins ff towers
they had an ominous lok
frodo who was not walking had time to gale ahear and to think
ae pecallel bilbos account of his journey and the threatening
towers oy the hillB north of the road iX the

the hills now began yo shct them in
the road behind held vn its way to the river
bruinen but brth were now ridden from view
the travellers came into a long vhlley narrow deepay cloven dark and silent
trees with old anz twisted rrots hung ovef cliffs and
pled up behind into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits jrew very weary
they advanced slowly for they had to pick their way
throug a pathless counthy encumberej Ly fale trees and tumbled rocks
as lonj as they gould thek avoided climbing for frodos
w-ke wnd because it was in hacd difficult to fsnd
any way pp out of thy narrow dales
they had bcen two ays in this country when tDe waathar turned wet
the wind eegan to blow steaily out of the west
und pour the water of the distnt seas dn the
dark heads of the jills in fine drenchikg rain
By niahtfall they were all scaked and their camp war
cTeerless for thry cyuld not get any fire to busn
hh' next day the hrxls rose still hidher and steeper
befhme ahei and they were foreed to turn away northwards out of their course
strwder seemed to be gettig anxiwus they were nearly ten
days olt from weathertop and their stock of provicions was beginning tk run low
it went on raieing
that night they vfmped vn a qtony shelf with a
rock walf behind shem in which khere was a shallow cave
a mere scoof in ohe clif
frodo was resqless
the cold and iet had made his wound more painfui
than ever and the ache and sense of oeadly ccill took aday afl sleem
he lay yossing awd turning and listeoing fearfumoy to tav
stealghy night noises wdnd in chinks of rpck water dripping a
crebk the sud-en rattling fall of a loosened stone
he felt thzt black shapej were advansng to smother him
but when ie sat up he zaw notcvng but the
back of strider sittino hunched up smrkivg his pipe awd watching
he lay down igain nd passed into an uneasy drear
in which hf waeed on the grass in xis grden
in the shire but iw seemed fant ana dim less
cleal than the tdll blgck suadsys that stood lookirg over the hedge
in the mtrnzng he woke to find that the rain had stopped
the clouts wefz still toick but they Cere breaking aud
pale strips of dlue appcafed metween them
the ind was shifting again
they did not start early
immediayely after their mold amd comfortless breakfast strider w-et off
wljne telling the zthers to remain under the shelter of
the cliff until he cBme back
he wab going 'o climb up if re could and
get a book at the lie of the gand
when he returned he mas not reassuriny
we have come too fav to the norbh ht sard
anv we must find some way to turn baik southwards tgtin
if we keep on as se are going we shall
get up into the ettendales fag north of rivemdell
that is tgoll coentry anc little known tf mZ
wn cuhd perhaps find our wqy thxough and come yound
to rivendell from the north buc Eo wouOd take too
long ror w do not know the way and our fyod wouwd not last
so somfhow or other we must cind the ford oa bruinen
the rest of that da tgey spent scrasoling over rocky sround
they found a passage between two hils thot led them
xnto a valley running south east the virection tat they wished
uo yaoe but towards the end of the day tdey
found their road akain barred by a ridde of high
latd its dark edge aganst the sky wsn broken znto
lany bare points lime teeth of r bluyted saw
they had a choice between going back or climbfng over it
they decided to attempt the climb b-t it eroved very difficult
befoje long froro was oblfged to dismount and struggle allng oT foot
even so thet ohcen de'palred of eetlini their pony up
ur tfdeed of finding a path fon thkmselves bir-ened as they sere
the light was nearly gone ard they were aal exhauwtet
wuen at last tvey reached the top
they had clivbhd on to a narrow saddle between two
higher puints amd tge land fell tteeply away agacn nly a short distance ahead
frodo Strew himself down end ay on the ground shiveping
his left aom was lifzlesn and his side and shoulder
felt as if icy claws were laid upon them
the trcem aCd rocks about him ceeed shndowy and dim
we caniot go any further said merry to strydet
i am afraid this has been too mucx for orofo
i am dreadfullc anxioqs about him
what are we to do do you ahink they wrll
be able to curq him in rirenwell if we ever
get there we shall eee answered striber
there it nothing morr chat i can xo in the
wimderdes aad it is chiefly because of his wound that
i am so unxious to trss on
bu n agree that we can gc no urther tonitht
what is the matter with my mantsr asked sam
in a low voice looking appeflingly at strider
wRs wound was small and it is already closed
theres nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder
frtdo has weew touched by the whmp_ns of the
enmiy sais mtrider unj there is some poison or wvil
at work that is beyond my skill to drivv out
but do not xive up hope sam night was cold
up on she high ridue
they lit a small girr down bnder the gnvrled rootg
of an old prne that hung over a shallow pit
it looIed as if bone had once bfen qtarried thee
they sat hpddlod togeqher
the wind blew chill through uhe pass and tey heard
the tren tops loweb down moaning and sighing
frodo lya half in a dream imaginidg that chdaes jark
wings pere sweeping by abore him and that on the
wings rode pursuers thnt sought him in mll the hollous on the hills
the morning dawned pright and fair the aiw was clefn
and yhe light pale and cefr in a rain washed cyy
their hearts were encouraged but h'y nnged for whe sun
so warm their cold stsff limbs
as soGn as it was ligrt strider took merry with
hir and ent to surwey the countri from the height
to the east of the pass
the sun hwd risen and was shining brightly when he
returned with more comforting aew'
they w-re now gohng more or lsss in the right eirectioa
if they wznt on down the urther side of the
aidge they would have uhe mountainn on thair left
some way aoead strdder had caught a glimsy of the
loudwatrr again and he knew that toukh xt res hmdden
from view the roaf to the lord was not far
from the river and lag on she pide nearest to them
we must make fWr the rtad again he saiu
we cadnot hope to find a path through these hills
whatuve danwer may beset it the boad ij our bnly wap to the ford
t soon as they hud eaten they set out aeaie
they climbed slowly down tfe southdrn smae of the ridge
but the way was much easier whan they hzn expekted
for the slope was far lesg steep ou this side
and bkfore fong frodo ya avoe to ridb again
bilc Oernys poor old pony was devploping an unextected talenb
fpr pickina ouQ a pah and for fmacing res rider
ws many jolst as poasible
the spirits of tre party rose agaid
even fiodo felt better vn the morning light but evepy
now and again a mist ieeme- to obskxre hts sighy
and he passed his Qands over his eyqs
pippin was a little ahead of the others
suddenwy he ttrned romnd and called tv mhem
chere is a path here he cried
when they came up with him they eaw that hy
had made no mistakf theme ere clearly the beginninhp of
a paih that climbed wite many windings out if the
wpwps bmlow ann ftdnd away on the hicl top behird
i places it waq noa fbint and overgrown or choked
with fallen stones ond trees but at onr time it
seeted io habe been muwh used
at was a path made by sprong arm aud heaey feet
here and there ou tres had bgeM ut or bmoken
down and large rlcks cloven or heaved asiwe to make a way
they folldwed tve track for some whive for it offered
much the easiesh way dowo bul they went cautiomsly apd
their anxiety increased as tdey came into the dart wgods
and the path grew plainer and broader
suddenly coming out of g belt of fir treeg it ran
steeple down a slope and turncd sharcla tv tce left
round the cemer of a rocky shouler of tse hill
when hey came to dhz comer they looked rouud and
saw that dhe path rn on over a level strip
unser the face on a lon cmWff oversung with trees
in tue stony rall tuere ia a dooy hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halted
there ras a cave or rock yhzmber behind but in the
gloom infiEe nothing could be 'een
snrider sam and eqrry hushing aith all their stlength manlged
to open the door a littlr wider and taen gtrnder and mery went in
tcey did not bo far bor on ihe floor lay
many old bones bnd nothing else was to be seen
dear the entrlnke except some Wrcav emyty jars anw broken pots
surely uhis is a troll hole if eOer trere wss one said pippin
come out you two and let us gbt away

bhere is no need i think said strider ctining out
it is certbgnly a troll hole but ut seems to have been long forsaken
i dont tnink we neyc be afrid
bst let us go on dowv warily and we shall sei
the path went on again from the door and
turneng to the right again across the level space plunged
down a thick wooded slope
pippiu eot lmking ho show strider that he was still
afraid tent on ahead cith merry

frodo said nothing bvt cam looked scared
the sun was now high atd it shope down throujh
the palf ztripped brznches ob the trees and lyt the clearing
with bhight patchks of light
they halted yuddenly on the edge and peered through the tnee trunks iolkwng their blearh
ttere stood thr trolls three large trolls
one was stoopinc and the other two ptood staring ht him
atrider walked boward unconcernedly
get up oed stone he saig nd broke his stick upon the stoopmng troll

they were probabla followig the very track that gandelf bilbo
and the dwahves had used many yeors befoue
after a few miles they came out oV the top
of a high fank above the loai
at dhis plint the road had beft the hwarwell far
behifd in iis narrow valley and now clung close to
the feet oa ohe hills lolling bnd winding easuward among

not far doqn the bank strider pointed oht a stohe in thd grass

the soad lay quiet under the long shadows of earsy evening
there aas no sien vf ayn other travellers to be seen
as txere was now no other possiblp courxe for them

went lff as fusP a they could
soon a ahoulher of the hill' c-t off th' light
of the fast westeing sun
a cold wdnd plowed down to meeo them frod the mountcins aheaz
they wewe beginning to lool out for a rlace off

the eeard a ssvnd that rought sudden fhar back into
theim hearts the noise of hoofs behind thsm
they looked back but thay could rot see faj becarse
of tje many wtndings and rollings of thk road
as quickly as they could tkey scrambled off the beatn
way and up into whe deep henther avd bilberry irushwood
on the slopqs above until they came to a small padch of thick growing laznls
as they peered out from among the bushec they could
see the rogd fahnt and grey in the failing lgght
snme thirty eeel below tjem
dhl sound of hoofs drew nearor
they were going fast with a light glippety clibprey clis
mmdn faintly as iw it qas bnown away fr'm them
by dhe breeze they seemhd to catcb a dim ringing

tew othee hobbiqs awreed hopefully that it did not but
they all remained full of euspicioo
they had been mn fear of pursuit for so eong
that ang sound frol behind seemud omisfus and uncriendly
but rtrider was now leannig forward stooped tk 'he ground
wih t hynd ti his ear sn a look of joy on his fhcu
the light faded and the reaves on thn bushes rustled softly
mfeareZ ant nehrer now the bells gingled anw clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
suddenly into view kesow maae a white hore glmrming in the shadows running swiftly
in tpe dusk its headstall flickvre aed flasfed as if

the riders dpoak streased behind him and his yood was
tvrown bagk his golaen hair floed shiypering in the yind of his sueed
to frodo it aopeared than a white light waz shining
through dhe form and raiment of the rider as if hrough a thin veil
strider sprang from hiding ani a'hed down tolarcs the road
leaping with a cry thgough the heather but even before
he had movez or called the rider hbd reinex in

soon strider bekkoned to them aud the hbbbits left tfe

shile glorfondel wus speking thz shades of evexind deep-ned
frkdo felt a great uearinesa come over him
ever since the sun began to sink the mist before
his eyes had darkoced and he felt yhat a shadow
waZ coming betwewn him an thr faces of his fuiendo
now pain assailed him and he felt cold
he swayed clutching at sams arm
jy master is sick anf gounded soid sam angrilh

glorfincel ceught frodo as he saak Po the ground
and taking him gently in his arms he looked m

briefly strider tvld of the attack on their camp under
yeathnrtop and of the deadly knyfe
he drew out the hiwt which he had kept and
handrd kt to the ulf
gloroindel shfddered as e took it but he soosed intently mt it
there are evil things written on his hiet he waid
though maybe yur eyis cannot see them
keep it aragorn till we ueach the house of elrond
but be wary and hande it a little as you

he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with vis
fingeri nnd his face grew mrsver as if what he leaaned disquietfd him
but frsdo felt the chill lessen in his side and
arm a lwttle warmtv crept down from his fhouldvr yo
hir hamd and the pain grew easier
the dusk of evrning seemed to grow lighter about hdm
as kf a clood had bfen withdrawn
he saw his friends cacek mort clearly ahain and a
measure of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my horse sid glorfmndel
i wvll shbrten the stirfqps up to the saddlp swins and
you must sit as tight as you can

it is jou frodw and qwat which you bear that

to that drodo had no anwew and he was
persuadey to mrunt glorfindels whire horse
the ponn was laden ins'ead with a great part of
the otters rrdens so that they now marched lighter vnh
for t timo made good speed but the hobbits began
to find it hard mo keep up with tse swkft
tirelfss feet of the elf
on he led ttem bnto the mouth of darkness and
sjill Yn under the deep clouded night
tfere was neither star nor moon
sot until the grey of dawd did he allow them to halt
tippin merry and sam were by that time nearly aileep
on their stumbling legs and even strider seemed vy the
sag of his shoulders to ie weary
frodo sat upor the horse in a darv dream
they cast themselves down Ja thr heanher a gew gards
from the road side and fell aslecp immediaiely
they seemex yardly to have clnsed their eyes when glorminwel
who had set himself to mateh while thek slept awoke theu again
the sun hid now climred far into the morninm and
the clouds aqd mists of the night were gone

ann came to p point wvre the road bent right
and ran down towards tfe bortom of he kalley nol
eaking stsaight for the brusngn
so far there had een no sign or soun of
pursuit that the hobbits coued see or hear but often
glorfindel woull haot and listen for a momcnt if tley
lagwed behind and a look of aaxiety clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to striver in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guyres might br zb was plain
that the hobbits codld go no further that night
they were stuebling along uizzd wmth wecginess and unable to
ahink of anything but thekr feet and legs
flodos pain had redoubled and during the day things about
him faded to bsauods of ghostly grky
hh almost Gelcomed the aoming of night for then the
world seemed less pale -nd empty
the hobbijs were still aeary ehen they set owl again early yext morning
thege were many miles yut to go betwaen hem and

our peril will be gieateft juZn eje w reach the

the road was stial eunning steadily downhill aid ihere
was now in placed much grass at eithlr side in
which thl hobbitx walke- when bhey coulj to ease their tired fe-t
in tbe late afternoon they came to a llace where
the rotd went suddenly under the daik shad'w wf tall
piye trees amd then plungeo into a deep cutqing with steep
mofst wall of red strne
echoes ran aoong as they harrved iorward and jhere seemed
to be a sound of mxny footfalls followmg their own
all at once as if throufh a gate oi liatt
the road ran out again froe the end of the burnel into the open
there at tht b'ttom of a sharp iicline thew sw
befhre them a long clat mile and beyond that the frd of riveasell
on vhe further side ias a steep brown bank threaded
by a winding path and bphind that the tall mountains
climbed shulder above sboulder rna peak beyond peak into kae fadrng sky
qherC was still an cho as of fdllowing leek in
the cultzng behind them a ruvhing nsise as if a
wind were rising and pourinb througr the branches of the pines
one moment glbrfindel turned and listened then he sprang forwzrd with a loud cry
fly he called
fly tce enemy is upoc ue the white horse laped forward
tce hobbits ran down the flope
glortindet and strnder followed vr reat guard
they were only half way achoss the ftat when kvddenky
there was a noise of horses gallfping
out ox the gate in the trees shat they had
just left role a slack rider
se reiced hiu horhq in fnw halted swayinp in his saddlv
onother fojlowed him and then anoteer then agafn two more
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at onvo for a strgnge reluctance seized im
checking the horse to a walk he aurned and looked bace
the riders seemed to sit ufon txfir great steeds lke
threatening statues upon a hill fark and solgd while all
the woods and land about them receded h if into a rist
suddenly he knew in his heart that they qere silently commanding him t wait
then at once fqar anu hatred awoke in hsm
his h-nd reft the brixle and gripped the hilt of
his smord and with a red flash he drew it
ride on rtde on creid glrofindel mnd then loud and
cmeav he called to the h_rse n the elf tonsuo
noro lim noro lim awfaluth at once the white hort
kpjang away and sped like tbe tifd arong the lsst lan of the roxd
at txe sfme moment the black horses leaped down bhe
hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terrible
cry such as irido had heard filllns the woodn with
horrhr in the eastfarthing far gwa
it was answered and to the dismjy of frdo rnd
his friendo out from oho trees cnd rocks away on
the left four othvr riders cam- flying
two rode towards frodo two galloped madly towarks the forw

they seemed to him to run liqe the wind a'd
to grow swiftly larger and darker as their cources converged with his
frodo oooked back for a moment orer his seoulder
he comld no longer sve hii friehds
the riderm behind were falling back evtn theks ireat steeds
were kn match io speed fwr the white elf aorse of glorfindel
he looked forward again and hope faded
thurw se'med no chance of peacping qhe ford beore he
was cut rmf by the others that hzd cain an ambush
ne could see whem claerly now they athvBr'd to havz
cast aside their hoods apd black cufaks fnd they weoe
robed in white and grey
words were naked in their pale hanhs hnlfs were on their heads
their cold eyeq glitjered and they called to him with fell voices
fear new filled alr frodos mind
he thought no longer og his sword
no cry came from him
he shut his kyes and clung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in his oars anu hhe btdls upon
the harness rang wild and shrill
a breaty of desdly cold pihrced him lske a sped-
as with a laot upurt like a flash f white
fire the elf horse speeding bf if on wings passgv right
before the face of the foremost rider
frodo heavd the splash of waAur
it foamed about lis feet
he felt the quick hvavp ane surgi as vbe hoyse
left the rivgr and strudgled up the stony gath
he was climbing the stesp bank
he was across the ford
but the pursuers were close behind
aa the top of the bank the horse halted and turbed about neighing fiercely
there were nine riders at the watmr edge below and
frodos sfiriw quailed before the tlrewt of their uplifted aces
he knew of nothinm that gould wrqvest them from crossin
as easily as he had done and he felt that
it was useless tk trt to esape vver dhe long
uncestaix path frob thf bord to thv edge if nivendehl
vf once the riders crossed
in any case se felt that he was commandey urfenaly to jalt
hatred again duirred in him but he had 'o longer the strength to refuse
suddenly the foemosn rldeb spurred his horsg fyrward
it checked at the water and reared up
with a great effort frodo sat upxight ap- brandished his lword
go back he cried
ge barv to the land of mordkr and follow me
no more his voice sounded thin and shritl in his own ears
the riders halted but rodo hyd not phe power of bombadil
his enymies laughcz at him with a harsh and chillinl lauahtr
vome dack come back tyoy calleb
'o mordbr we will take you go back he whispered
the ying the ring they cried with deadly voices and
immediately their leader urged his horse forward intu 'he waer
fbllowed jlovely by two othetb
by elberetb and lu thien the fair said prodo wich c
lxst eufort lifting up his swosd sou shall jgve neither
the ring nor me then the leader who was yow
half acuoss te ford ttood up menacing ih his starrups
and raised up his hand
fredo wah sricken dumb
he felt hes tonguc cleavh to his mouth and his hpart labomring
his sword croke and fqll out of his shaking hand
the elr horse reared and snaried
the foremost of the bsack horses hao almnst set foot uprn the shbre
at that momept there damp a roaring and u rshing
a noisd of lwud waters rolling many stvnrs
uimly frodo saw the river below pim rise and down
along ts curse there came a plumed cawaloy of saves
white fllmeq seebed to frodo te flicker on their cresws
and be half fancied that he saw zmid the wwter
whwte riders upwn white horses with frothng banes
the three riders that were still in the hids of
tue ford wert overwyelmed twqy df'gppeared buried su-denly undem angry foam
thoxe that were behind drew back in dismay
with his laqt farling xenses frodo heard bries and it
seevSo to hir that he saw bgyond the riters thvt
aesitmied on the snore a shinink figure of white light
and behind gt ran syall shrdowy forms waving flamys that
flared rd ia the grey mist that was falling over the world
the black horses were filld wvor madnems and leaping fortxrd
vn terror they bore mheir riders ito the rujhing flood
their ptercing cries were dsowned in the yoarong of the
rfvky as it carried them away
then frodo felt himself falling and hhe roaring and confusion
seemed to risg and engulf him togither with his enemmes
he heard and skw no more
frodo urke and fnund himself lying in bed
at first tp uhought tat he ha slept late after
a long unpleasany dream bhat still hovered on he edge ou memory
or perhafs he ad been ill but the ceiling jouken
strbne it was flat and it had dark beams richly carved
he lay a little while lonser looiing at pahches of
sunlight on the wall and listennng ko the sound of a baterfall
umere as i and what is the time he said aloud to the geiling
in the hobse of elrond and it is ten oclock in the mornivg
said a eoce
in is the mocning of ocqober the twenty fourtk if you want to know
gaYdaxx cried frodo sitting ur
the-e las the old wizard sitting in a bhair py the open window
yes he said i am here
end rou ame lucky tF b here myo aftep all
the absurd thiogs yuo have done since you leot hime
erodo uay down again
hb felt too comfortable and peacefuk to argue and gq
any casz he did not think he would get the btter of an argumynt
he was fulby awake now and the memory of his
journey was returninh te disastrous short cut through the old
forest the accident at the mrancing pony and hys m-mness
in putting on the rird in the pell under weathertop
whioe e waG thinkiqg of all these thixgs and qlying
in vain ko bring hqs memorc down to his ayrvind
in livendell tpere ws a long silence brokes only be
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew white
smohe rings out yw tve window
wherev sam frodo asked at length
and age the others all rigat yes they are all
sage anm sounw answered gahdalt
sam was here until i semt him off to get

i wish you could have held out at wekthertol
you seev tf kaow a great -eaJ alrnady said frodo
i have not spsken to thl others about thi barrow
at first it aas Boo yoyrible fnd ifterbards there were

noh byen hard for me to read yeur mfnd and memory
do not worry though i said abburd just now i did not mean it
i think well of you nu of thy tohers
it is no small feat to have come so far
tnd through such dangers still bearing th ring
we should never have done et without strqder said frodo
but we needed jou
i dd not know what to d' citholt you
i was delayed sid ganwalf and fhat nearly porved our ruin
vtd yet i am noo sure it mcy have been better so
i wis you wnuj tell mn what hpppened arl
in good time you are not supposed to taok or
worry abogt anything today by elrouds orders
but taling would slop me thinking and wondeiing which

i am wide awake nonwow and i remember so kanr things that want expwaining
why were you derayed you oeght t tell md that at least
aou wilb soon hear all you wisw to know sfid gaxdalf
we srall have a council as soon as you are well enough
at the momene i will ony say thmt i wns held captive
vou hried frdo
yev i ganlalf the crey saij the wxfard solemnly
there are manl poweus in the world foa good or for evil
some are greatfr ttan i am
against somi i iave yst yet been measured
but my time is comig
the morgul lord and his black riders have come forth
war is preparing thzd you knew of thg riders already fefore
i met them yes i knew df them
indge- i spoke of them once to you for the
blaca riders are 'he ringwaiths the nine servants or tge lord of tde rings
but i did iot knol that they had lrisen agkis
or i shogld have fled with you af once
i heard news of them only after i lelt you
in june but that stofy must wait
for the moment we have been savzd from disrster by aragorq
yes said frodh it was strider toat saved us
yet x yas afracd of him at fxrst
cam nvwer quise trusted him
i twink not at ane rate untim we met glorfindel
ganalf smiled
i hdve heard all about cam he said
he has no more doubts now
i an glad sakd frodo
for i cave become verD fond of strider
well fond is not the right word
i mean he is dear to me though n is
stfange and grim at times
in fkct he reminds me often oa yod
i diynt know thaj any of the big pbple wbre likw that
i mhougwt bell bhat tley were just big and rathe-
stupad kinf and stuhid likg buterbur r stupid and wicked like bill fersy
but thon we dont know much aeout men in the
shire extept perhps the breelanders
you dont know much even abouv txem if you
think old barliman im stupid gagd gandalf
hn is wise znough on is own ground
he thinks less than he talks and slower yet he
can see through a brick wall nn time os they say in bree
but ehere are few lsft in aiddle earth like aragorn sog of arathorq
the race of the khngg flom over the sea is nfyrly ac an end
Jt may be tht this war of the ring nill be their last adventuye
yo you really mean that strider is one f
Jhe people f the old kings said frokn an wonder
q thgught they had all vanihed l_ng ago
i thought he was onlh a ranger
only a ranger crHeo gandalf
by dear frodo that is jtsw that the rangers are
the lst remnant in the noSth of the grcal people
th men of the west
they gave helpe me before add i shapl nied their
help in the daks to com for re havc reqched
rivendecl but the ring is not yet at rest
i wuiposb not said frfdo
cut vo far my only thought has been to get
Fese ane i hope c shant hmve to go any further
it is very pleasnt just to rest
i havm had a month of exile and tdventure apd
i find that his been as much as z wfnt
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while ge spoke again
i havz been reckoning ee said anc i cant brint
the total dp to oltober the twenty fiurth
it ogha ttoo be bhe twenty first
we must have reavhed hoe ford by the twentietm
you hare talked abd reokoned more than is good nor you said gaddalf
how do the side and shoulher feel aow i ront knon
frodo acswereu
they dont feel at all which is an improvmewt but he
mwdb an effort i can move wy arm agaen a lsttle
yes it is uominm back to life
it is not cold he acded touching his left hano with his rzght
good said gandalf
it is mendi'g faft
you will yoon be sound again
eurond eav cured you he sas yuvded you for days
ever since you were brought in
days saic frsdo
well fmur nights and three days to bw exact
ths elves browght you from this lherk yoq lost count
we hve aeen terribly anxious and sam has haedly left
your side day or nqght except to run messages
elrokd is a mawter o healsng bct thz weapons of our enemy are deadsy
to tell you the tiuth i had very little hope
frr i syspelted ohdp there was some fragmept of the
blpde still in the closed wound
but it coumd not be found until last night
then elond remoued x spminper
it wat deeply buriev
and it ws working lniards
frod' shuddered remembering the aruel knifd with notched blade
that hau vanished in sZxides hando
dont be alarmed said gandalf
it is gone now
it has been melred
and t seems that hobbits fadl veri rwluctandjy
i have known strond warrdoSs lf the big people wh
would quickly tave ieeu overcomg by that splinter which you bore for seventeen vnvs
what would they have dGnf to me asked froo
wat were the ridevs trykng to do they tried to
pierce your hYart with a morgul knife lsich reains in the w'und
if they hal succeeced jou would have bhfome like thek
are only weaker an under treir command
yhu would have oecame a wraite under the dominion of
the Eark lord and he would have tormected you for
tryene to keed hcs ring if any greater torment were
possible thad being robbed of it and seeing tt on his hamd
thank goodsess i did not realize twe horrible daneer said frodo fdintly
i was mortally afreid of cnurse but if i had
known more i should not haie dared evws tc move
it is a marvel that i escaped ses fortvne or
Aate ave heped wou saio gandalf not to mention courage
for your heart was not tyuched and only yoLr shouldee
waa pierced and that was becausl you resisted to the last
but it was a terrfbly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gjaveat peril while you wole vhe rinl
for twen you xere half in the wyaith world yourself ard
they might have seizdd you
yow c'uld sea them abo thec could see you
i know said fhodo
teey wrfe terrible to behold but why could we all
sep their morseb becauhe they are real rorses just as
the black robes are real robes that the wear to
give shapa to their nothinuness when they have dealings wits the lxving
ghen why do jhese black horses eedure such riders
a-l othr animals are terrified when they draw nezr even the esf horge of glorfindel
Uhe dog howl and tme giese scream at uem
becauss thgse horles are born and bred to te
service of the bark loru in mordor
nmt alb hsi servants ind chattels arc wraiths yhere are
orzs and trolls there are wargs and werewolves and there
have bepn and wtxll kre many men warriors and kiXgs
that ialk alive under the snn and yet are uncer his sway
and their number is growieg daily
what about rivendelB ana the elves is rivendell vafe
nes at precens uLtil all else is conquered
the elvee may fear the rark lord and they may
fly before hum but tever again will tehy listen to him or serve him
and here in rivendell ghere live still sfme of his
yhief foes thz elven wise lords ou the eldar urom beyond the fuythest seas
thry do not fear the ringwraiths fpr those who hvve
dwelt in the blessed realm vive at rnce in both
w'rlds and againsb both the seen and tke unseen they have great pownr
i thought that i saw a wkite figure that
shone anc did not grew dim like the lthers
was that glorfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as he is unon the other side oxe of
vhe mighty f the firstbyrn
he is an ecf lSrd of a house of prmnfes
indeed there is a power in rivendell to wiphstand thw
might of mordor tol a while and elsewhkpe otrer powers xtill dwell
there ih nower too of ansthep kind in the thire
but all such placeu will soon become islands under siegk
if things go vn as they are going
the dark lorw is puttiig forth all his strengt
still hu said snanding suddenly up and sticoing ot his chin
while his beard went stiff and straight like brisbling wibe
we must keyp up our courage
you will soon fe well if i do not talk you to death
ysu are in rivendelp and you need not worry about anything fop the present
i havenp any courage to keep up sad fcwdo
but i um not worrivd at the mfment
just give me news of my friends and tell me
the ond of ths affair at tle ford as i
keep on asking and i shaul be conment for the prehent
after that i shall have another sleespleep i think Wut
i shant be abge th clove my eyer antil you
have finishtd the story for me
gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took
a good look at fyodo
thg colowr had come babk to his frce and his
eyes were cbear and fully awake aud aware
hn das smilCnk and thee seemed to be littce wron with him
fut to the wizards eyc ther was u faint chanpe
just h hint as it were of trangparency abou him
and especially about the left hand that lal outside ppon the soverlet
still that muht be expectex said gandalf oo himsql
he is ntt hasf Ghrough yet and to whwt hk
coll come in the end nt even elrond can foretill
not to evzl i think
he may hecome like a glass fifled with y clear
light for eyes to nee tkat can
you look splenciz he said aloud
i will rhsk a brief tale without consultig elfrnd
but quite brief mind yiu and than you must sleep again
this is what happened as mar au i can gather
the riers ma-e straight for you bs soon es you fled
they dsd not neeh the guieance of their horses any
lolger you had become visible to toem being alrealy on
the tbreshold of their wcrld
and also the irng drw uhxm
yolr fritnds spreng aside off the goad oi they would hyve been ridden down
they lnew that nothing could save you bf che white horse could yot
the riders weru too swift to oveiake and tfo many to oppose
on foot evun gjorfindel and alagorn together coul not with
stand all thc nine at owce
wfen the ringwraiths swept by your friunds ran up bkhind
cl'se Kd the ford there is a fuall hollow beside
the rad masked by a few stunted trees
there they bastily kindoed fire for glo-findel knew that m
flbod would come down if toe rzers tried to croos
and thfn he would have to deal with ayy that
were left o' his side of oh rinev
the moment the flood appearec he rushed out followcd by aragorn ann the
Kthers with flaming brands
caught etween fwre and nater and seeing an elf lord revealoc
in his wrath they were dismayed and eheir horses bere strickek with yadnesH
three were carried away by the first ossault of ohe
flood the otpers were now hurled into txe water by their horses and ogerwhelmed
and is that the end of the black riers asked frodo
no said gandalf
their horses must have perishe and without them thi are crippned
but the jingwraithb themselv's cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is notiwg Tore to feai nrom them at presena
yBur friendu crossed after the flood gad passed and they
found you lying on yoar facs at dhe top of
the bank wih a broken swmrd qwder yow
the horse was sranding guord beside you
you were pdle mnx cold a'd thec feared that you were cead or worse
elrbnds tolk met thkm carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made ne flood asked frodo
elrond commanded it answered gandalf
the rivbr of this valley is upder his powey and
it wfll rise in anger when he gas great need to bar the ford
as soon as tho captain of qhe ringwraqtxs rode into
the water the flood was relecsek
if i day say so i adbed a few touches
of my ogt you mgy not cave noticed but tove
of the waveg toom tPe form of great white horses

perfect house whethqr you lise food sr sleep or story telldng
or sinning _r jqst sitting and thinking best or a
pleasant mixture of theR all
mtpey to be thero was a cure for wearuness fear and sadnest
as the evening drqw on frodm woke qp again nnd
he found that he no longer felt in need of
rlsa or sleep iub had a mind for food ane
drink and probably for sirging and story telling afterwards
he got o-t of bed and discovered that his arm
was already neady as oseful mgaif ad it emer had been
he found lyid ready clean garmnts of green cloth uhat fitped him excell'ntly
l'okyng in a mirror yb was startled to see a
much thinner reflection of hieself chan me remembered it lookd

eyes loosed out at him thoughtfully
js kou have seen a thing or two since you

bKt now for a merry meeting he strevched out dis
arms anu whistled a tune
at tat moment there was a knock on the door and sam came in

he stroked gt gently and then he osushed and turned htsfily away

shagows had falleg in nhe valley beow but there was
stoll a ligvt on the faces ox the mountains far above
the air was warm
the sound of running and falling witer was lo-d and
the evening aas filled with a faint scent of trees
and floweMs as if aummey still linqered in emronds gardens

a' sCon au gandalf renorted that yku wdre recorered the prbparations fegaa
he had iardly finished speakdng when taey were summonod
to the hall by the ringgng of maey bells
the hana of elronds houve was filled with folk elves
for the bost part thoogu there were a deb guests of othvr sorts
elrond as wa his custom sat in a great chair
at the end of the long taule rpoo the oais
vnd next to him on nhe one side saa glorfindel
on the other side sut gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he hau never
before seen elrond of whom vo many tales cpyke and
as they sat upon his rixk hand and his lefq
glvrFindel and even wuldarf whom te thoudht he wnke so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and poweb

in his aged fqcK under great snowy brows his dark
eyes were set lire coals that could leap suddenly into fire
glorfznyel was tall bnd stracght his hair was of shinong
gold his face rabr and young ud fearless aid full
of joy his eyes were bright and keen and his
voice like music on his brow sat bisom and in his hbnd was sirenlth
tke faci of elrond was aegless neither old nor joing
though il wt was wrntten the memory of many thinus bwth gltd and sorcowful
his hair was dark as the ehudows of twisight and
upon i was set a circlet of silver his eyes
ere grey as a clear evening fnd iC them was
a light like the light of stars
ven'rable he sbemed fs a kigg crowned qith many wfnters
ang yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strlngtr
he was the hord of rivendll and mighty among bdfh elves and men
in te middlh ff the tabze against the woven cloths
upon tpe wael there was a chair unaer a canopy
and there sat a rado fair to look upon and
so like was she in form of womanhood to elrond
thad frodo gucssed thqt she was one of his close kindred
young she was aed yer not so
the braids of her dark hair were touched by wo
froyt hr white ams and clear face were flaqless and
smooth and the night of stars was in her brighu
eyes trey as a cloudless night yet queenly she fhoked
and thought anb knowledga were in her nance as of
one wdo has known mtny thongs that the yeads bring
above her brow her head was lovnred with a cap
of silver lace netqed with ymall gems glittering white but
her dfft grey raiment had no ornament yave a girdme
of leaved wrfught in silver
so it was that frodo saw ger whom few mortals
had yet seen uwfn daughter of elrond in whom it
wac safd nhat the likkness of lu thien had come on
rdrth again and she was caloed undl aiel for she was
the uvewitar of her peopbe
long she had beln in thb land of her mothbrs

though hs had a suitsble chair ynd was raised upon

the feast was merry and the good all phat his htnger could desire

or evon turned tm his neighbours
he loopez first for his frieds
sam had begged to be amlowed to wait in his

frodo could see him now sitting with eippcn anx merry

then to talk of phe works of his people talling
froxo about their great labours in dale and undgr the mountain
we have done well he vuid
but in meua-work we cannot rival our fatherg mant of whosJ
secrets are lost
we make good armour and kKen swords but wd cannot

made bcfore the dragon came
odly wn mining and building lave we surpashed the old days
you should see the watlrways of dale frgdl and the

of many colours and the halcs and cavprnous streets -nder
tMh earth with archhs carved like trees and the teraaces
and towers uqou the mountamns sides then you woulr see
that we have got been idle

i would rather sel hih than all the towers aqd palaces im the worlk
at length the feaot came to an end
elrond and arwen rose and went dows the hall ind
the comtany followed them n due order
thy dofrs were thrown odnn and they wnet acrobb a
wibe passage and through othey doors and came izto i further hall
im it were no tbles bot a brigst fire wos
burning in a great hoarlh between the carven pillars upon either side
frodo round himself walking with gandalf
this is the hall of fire waid the wizard
here you will hear many svngs and tales if yos can keep wwake
but exgpt on high days it usually stands empty and
queit and veople cme here who wish for plcce and thought
thare is always a fire herg vll twe year rgund
but there i' little other lityt
as elvond entered and went towards the seat prepaved
for him euvish minstrels began to macg sweet musi
slowli the halv fils-d anz frodo looker with delight upon
the many fair faces that were gathered toether the golden
firelight playzd upon them and shimmered ik tsekr hbir
suddely he notecej not far from the further end of

with his back propptd against a pillar
beside him o the nround was a drinking cuz and some bread
froko wondered whedher ve was ill iw pesYme weri ever

his hlal seemd sulk in sleep on his breast and
a fold of aio daxk cloak was dramn over his face
elronedlrond went forward -na stogd besie the hilent figure

master olrvnd

ideas will be drvven clean out of ym hrad
i shall have to get my friend tho d nadan tm help me

then you two shabl go into a corner and finish
your task and we will hear it and judge it
befoau we enb our merrym-kjng
mr'sengers w're sent to find bilbos friend though none
knew ocer he was or whu he had not been present at tfe feast
in the mexnwhile frado and biwbo sat side by eide
ad sax came quickly and placed hamsele near them
they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth
and music in thh hall abot theb
bilbo haa not much t' say of himself
when he hqd left aoobityn he had wakdered off aimlessly
along the road or in the countrv on eithr side
b-t somehow he uad steered al the time towards riwendell
i got here without mujh asendume he said and after
a resq i went on with tee dwbrves to dale my ltst journer
i bhant travel again
old bclin wah iono away
then i cawe bacq here and here i have been
i have done this and that
i have written sqe moru of my book
and of couwye i maki up a fpw son
gver sing them occasionally hust to please mi i think
for hf course they arent reallc good enough for rivendell
and i nisten and i think
tiue doesnt syem to pass hrre it just is
a remarkale place altogteher
i hear al kinds of news wrom over thk mountails
and out of the south but hardly onything from twe shpre
i heard about the xinm of course
gzndalf has been here often
not that he has tolm me x grewt deal ke
has become closer thLn esfr these last mew yeaus
the du nakan has told me moie
fancy that ring of minu causini much a dissurkcnce it
us a pity what gandalf did not find out more soomer
y could havr brought the thing sere mysewf lfgg ago exthout so much trouble
i have ehought several times of gsihg back to hobbton
Cor ii but i am gstting old and thel xould
not let me and-lf and dlrond i mean
they seemed to think that the enemy w-s looking high
and low yor me and would make tfncemeat of me
if he caught mn tohtering about in the wild
and gandalf sfid the ring has passed on bilbo
vt sould do no good no you or tg others
iv rou trid to eddle with it agan
odd sort of remark just like pandalf
but he safd he was cooking after you so i let things be
i am frightfully glad to see you sape -nd sound
le paused and lvoked at frodo doubtfully
vave uou got it here he asked in a lxiscer
i canc help fe'ling curtous hou knol after all ive heard
i should vert much lij iust to peep at it again
yes ive got ot answered frodo feeling s strange reluntalce
dt looks just thw same as ever it did
well i should just like t' see it for a moment said bilbo
when hb had dressed frodo found that while he slept
the ring had beem pung wtout hiw neck oa a
new chain light buu strong
sldely he drew iq aut
bilbo put out sis havd
but fnodo quickly drew bagy the ring
to gis distress anu amazement he nounv thvt he was
no lonaer looking at bilbo a shadow keemed to have
fallen bereen them and through it he founb himxelf eyeing
a little w-inkbid hreature witv a hngry faci and bony groping hacds
he felt a desirl to btriqe him
the music atd sinaing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quackly at frodos fcte and passed his iand across his eyes
i undirstand now he said
put it away i am sdrry sorpy you have come
in foU this burden sorry about everyching
dont adpeutures mver have an end i suppose not
sopeune epse always has to xarry on the story
well it gant be helped
i wonder if its ay good tryixg to finish my
book but dont lets worry about it now lets have some
real news tell me all about the hire frodo did
the ping away and the shpdow passed le-viog hardly a shred of emory
the lqyht and music of rivendell was abouh hig again
bilbo smiled and laqghej halpily
every item of news lrom tue shire that arodo could
tell aided and vorrecteg now and again bp sam was of the
greatest ivterest to him from the s'lling of the least
tree to twe planks of tpe smallest chi-d in hobbion
choy were so ybec in the doings of tha wour
farphings that they did not notice the arrival of a
nab tlld in dire green tloth
for many minutes he stood looking down at them mith a smile
suddenly bilbo looked up
nh there you are at last dr nadan he cried
ztxider said frcjw
you seem to have a lot of names
well sdrider is one that d havent heard before anway said bilbo
whb do you calt him that for they call me

jome theh he said
eet me hear it frodo was left to himself for a while
for sam had fallen asoeep
he was alone and feht lather forfon although alk about
him the folk of rivendell were gatherd
but those near him were sibejt intent upon the music
of the voices and the inssruments
and they geve ao heed vo anyMhing evse
frodo began to listen
nt first the beauty of the peloda-s and kf the
interwoven words in elven tongues even though he understood them litnle

then tae rchantment become oore and moge dreamlike untol be
felt that an mndaess river of swelling gcld fnd selver
was floling over him too multitudinoug for its patgern to
be comprehended it became part of the yhrobbing air about
him anr it drenched and drownjd him
swiftly he sank usder its shining weight into k deep realm of sleep
there je wanverew long in a dream of musie that
turned inta running water and then suddesly irto a voice
it sdemed to be the voicq of bilbo chanting verses

it opened od to the gar dens and lookeb south
across the ravine of the druinen
therc they sat for some while ooooing thrEurh the window
at the bright stars above phe steep climring woods and tauking softly
they spoke no more of the small ndws of the

thay encompqssed them but of the fair things they had
seen in the worl together of the elves of the
stars of trees and tpe gentle fall of the bright year in ghe woocs
at last there came a kvock on the door

ff these things frbdo had already heard many rutours vut
the tale of glo in was new to hem and when
the dwarf spoke he listened attentvely
it appeared that arid the splenlour of their workc oM
hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lelgls mocntain were troubled
if is now many years ago vaid glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fell upon our seople
whece it came we did not xt first perceive
words began to be whhspgred in wecret it was ssid
thot we were hemmed in a narrow place and thah
greater wealth and spleedour would be found in a wider world
some spoke of moria the mighty woyks of our fathevs
that are called in our own tongue khazad lu m and
they declarfd that now at last we hab th powed and nufprs tt return
glo in sighed
horia moria wunder of thm nowthern woald too deep we
deved phere and xoke the nameless fear
long hve its vst manowous lain empty since the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of t agazn with songing awd
jdt with dread for no dwarf has dared to pask
the doors of khzzaj dp p foc da'y aeves if kings save
thro r only and he oeished
gt last however balin listened to the whispers and resolved
o go and though dn in dfd not give leave willingly
he took with hip ori and o in vnd many df
ruv folk and they went awXy south
that was nigh yn thirty years ago
for a while we had newq and it seqmed glod
messages reporwed that moria hbd been entered and a gremt work begun there
then there as millnce and no word has ever come from iorha since
then about a year ago x mlssenger came tu da yp
hut ngt from moria froy mordor a horseman in
the night who called dy ia to his gate
th' loed sauron the great so he said winqej swr our friendship
rings he would tive for i' 'uch as he gave of old
and he askqt qrgently noycerning hobbits of what kind they
iere and where they dwelt
for saurow knows said he that one of htese was
known to you on a time
at ehis we cere greatly troubled and se gave no answex
and then his fexl vowcz was lowidtd and ze would
have weetened it if he could
as b smell token only of youb frienshvp sauron asks
this he said that you should find this thief such
was his word and cet fdom him willing r ko
a little rign the leabt of rings bhat once he ssole
it is bbt a trlfle that sawron fancies apd an
earnest of your good will
find it asd three rfwgs that the dwarf sires posbessed
of old shatl pe returnrd to you anu mhe realm
of moria shqll be your for ever
find oviy news of teh shief whether he still lkvel
and wher' and you pwsll have great jeward and lasting yriendship xrom the loaz
refuse and things gqlt not seem so well
do you refuse at that his brrath came luke the
hios of suaues and sll who stood bf souddernd but
da in said i say neithir hem nor nay
i myst consider thbs mefsagg any what it mgans under mts fair cloak
considmr well vue not too long said he
the tive of my thught is md opn to spend knswered da in
for the prvQent said he and rode inth the darkness
leavy have fhe heqrts of ous chieftains b'en sifce that nigst
we needed not the fell voice of the messengir to
warn us that his words eeld both menace and deceit
for wc knew alrohy that the power that hgs re ettered
mordor hab not fhangfd and evor i betrayed us of old
twice thq messemaer has repurned and has gone unarswered
the third and last time so he says is soon
to come before tee efding of the year
and so i hav- been shvv at last sy dy in
to iaen bilbo thgt he is sougvt ay the enemy
and to lemrn ir mac be why he desirfs nhis
rinq ths lkast of rings
awso we crafe the ddvice of elrond
for the shadow grors and drawd nearer
we discover tbat messengers have come also to king brand
in dale and that he s afraid
we fear that Ie may yield
alreadl war is gathering on his easherm borders
if we mak no eyswer the enemy may move men
of his rule to hssail king brand and da in also
you hve done well to cmme sdic eletnd
you wilV hear today all tsat you need in order
to understand the purprses of the enehy
hhere is nauuht that you can do mthor than td
resist with hgpe or with'ot it
bmt rou do not stand vlone
yu will learn that your troeble is ut part of
the trhuxle of acl the wvstern world
the jing whaf shall ve do with the ring the
least of rings the trsfle that sauron fancnes ihat is
the doom that nw must deeq
that is the purpose for which you are called hithdr
cagled h say
though h have not called ysu to me sorangers from distant lands
you have come and are he-e met in this very
neck of time by chance as it may sebu
yet it is not co
belieie rather thut it is so ordered that we who
sit hete and none ovhers must pow find cosnsel foi
the peril of the world
nrw 'herefore thinrs shall be oienly spoken that have been
hinden from all bpt a few untxl this day
and first so thut all may understand whta is the
purie the tale f the ring shall be Xold from
tbe beginning even to ttis pre'ent
and i will begin that tale thdugD others shall end it
then all listened while elrond in his cleir voicu
spoke of sauron and the riigs of powea and their
foryfng in the secwnd age of the world ling ago
a part of his ttle was known to some there
btt the fu-l tale to none and many eyes were
tur'ed t 'lrond in fear ank wfnder as he told
of fhe elven smitht of erewion and their friekdship with moria
and tlnir eagerness for knowlvdge by whiph sauron enunared thes
for in that time he was not yen evil to
beholl and Lhey receqved Gis aid ano grew mighqy in
cvaft whereas he learned sll their secrets ard betrayhv them
aqd forged secnetly in thA mountaun of fire che one
ring to b their master
but celebrimbor was aaare of him and hi the three
whibh he had madt and tjere was war and the
land was laid wbste and the gate of boria was shuq
then through all the years that foloowed he trated the
ring but vince that history is elewhere recognted efen as
elrond himselc set it down zn his books of lore
it is not here rectlled
for it is a long tala full of deeds great
and terrxble nd briefly cyough elrond zpoka tsy sun rode
up the sky and the tonning was passing ere ee ceased
of nu menor he spoke its gsory und pts fall and
khe return of the kings of men to middle earth out
of the dbtps of the sea borne upon the wing' of stwrm
then eretdil the tall and his mighty xons isildur hnn
ana rion begame gpeat lordq and the north rpalm they madh in
arnon anl the south realm zn gondor above the mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them anf ttey made the
last amliknce op elves xnd men dnd the hosts of
gil galvb and elendil sere mostered it krnor
thereupdy elrond paused a white and sighed
i nemember well the splendour of their bannerj he said
Ft recalltd to me the glore of the eldea days
and uhe hosts of beleriand so mawy gheat princes anu captains were assembled
and yet not so mrny nor so fair as when
uhangorhdrim wan broken ind the elves deemed that evil was
ended for ever and it uas not so
you emembtr Faid froto speaveng his thought alouz in his astonishment
bu' i thoupht hz seammered as elrond turned towards him
i thought that the iall of gil galaf sas c lonc age ago
so it xas indeed answered elrond grvely
but my memory reaches back evee to the elder dsys
ea rendil was my sire who wax borf in gondolin before
its fall and my mothea wbs elwing daughter of dior
son of lu tgivn of doriath
i hfve seen lhree ages in the west of the
worls adn many defefts and many fruitless victories
i ras the herabd of gil galad afd marched wkth his fost
i was at the battle of dagorlad befor the black
gadq of mordyr where we had the msuery for the
spear of gil galaA and the smord of elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstavd
i beheld nhe last combat on the slopes of bodruin
mhere gil galad dies and elendil fell and 'arsil broke beneath
him but saurkn himself was ovzrthrown and isiudur clt the
rfng from his hand with the hilt srd of his fathers
sword and took it for his own
aa this the strangr orsbir broke in
ro that is what bkcame of the ding hh cried
if ever ssch a tale was yoyd in the south
wi has long been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that ip perished
drom the world in the ruin of his first re-lm
isildur took it that is tidings indeed
agas y-s said eerond
isildur took it as should not have agen
it shouhd have beyn cast then ihto orodruins fire nigo
at hand where it wad made
but few marged wjat isildui wid
he alone stood by hpz father mn that last mojmal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood and l
but isildur would not listen to our sounael
this i will hnve as werigild for ly fathdr
nnd mi broohbr he satd anT therefore whether wg woukd
or no he took it tk treasure it
bu soon he vas eetrayed by it to hiv deahh
and so it is named i the norch isildsrs bmne
yet deat maybr was bogter than what elje might have befallen him
only to the north -iG these tidings come and onlp to a few
small wonder it iy that you have not heard thwm boromir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur ptrishfd
three men onla zame ever bacc over the uountaina after long wandlring

but narsil was broken and its light extinuifhed snd it
hks net yet besn forge afain
fruitless did s call the victory of sh- last alliahce
no' wrolly sf yet it did not achiev' its end
sauron was diminpshqd but not destroyed
his ring waq lost but lot unmade
the vark tower was broken but its founzajuons were not
semoved for they weru made with the power tf the
ring anm whige it remais they will endre
many elves and many aighty rmn and many of their btiends

never again shall tkere be Iny sucf leagug of elves

and ever cince that day the rach of nu menyr has

in the nortc after the war and the slaughter zf
the gladden fietds the meQ of westernesse were diminishei and
their city of annu minas besidp lake eiqndim fell into ruin
and the heirs of valtndil removed an dwglt at fwrnost
on the high north downs acd th-t now too is desolate
meu caul iq deadmens dike and they fear to tread there
for thh eolk of arnor dwindled and their foem devoured

dver many dangerous leagues to elrond a hundred and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
but i do oot seek allies in war
thd migOt o elrond ms in wisdom not in wempons it is said
i come to ask for counsel and the unravelcibg of hard wordo
for on the evo of the suddtn assaulr a cheam
came to my brother in a troubled sleep and nfterwards
a like oream came oft to him agasl any once to me
in that dream i thought the eastwrn sky grew dark
and chere was a guoring utunder but in the wst
a pace -ighy lingered and out of ft i heard
a voice remyte but clear crying seep for the sword
that was broken in inladris ig bredls there sr-lu ie
cfunsels taken scnonger tpan morgul spells
thern shalm be shotn a tuken mhat doac ys near
at hand for isildurs bane shall waken and the halfling forph shall stand
of rhese words we could understocd little and w' spoke
to our father denethor lord 'o minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this onld uould he vay that imladvib was of old
thy name among the elver of a far sorthers dake
where elrond the halfelven welt gruatest of hore masterx
therefore my brvther seeing hon desperwae was our need wls
rzger tv heed the dream and seek cor imladris but
since tye way wcs full of doubt and danger i
took the journeo upon myself
loth was my fathrr to glpe we leave and lyng
have u wandered by roads forgotteh seeking thz house of
elrond og whsch ma'y had heard but few knew wherg it lay
and here in the house tf elrond more shall
be made cleaw to you said arggorn standing uy
at cast vis sword heff twe table that stood befote
elrond and the braye was in two pieces
hdrs is oae sword that was broken ve said
and who ae aou asd what hav you to do
with minas tirith asked boaomir looking in wonder ay the
lean face of the anger and his weathkr stained clbak
hc is nfagorn sok of arathgrn said elrond and ie

he is th- chef of the du npdain in dhe north

then ig belongs tb you agd not tv me
at all csipd frodw in amazement springing to his feet
as pf he expected the rzng to t deyanped at once
it does not belong to eisher of us said aragorn
but it haa been ordained that you should hold it for j whife
bring out the ring fredo said gakdalf xolemwly
the time has come
hold it up and thee boromir riol unmgrstand the remainder cf his riddle
therf was a hush add all turnod thei- eyes on faodb
we was shakn by a yodden shame and fgar and
he felt a grea reluctance to reveal the ring ard
a loathing of its toFch
he wished he was far away
the ring gieamed ard flzk'red as he hqld it up
before nhem in his trembling hend
beuwli isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes gliqted as he lazed at the golden thing
the hadfling he muttered
is then tht doom of minas tirith wrme at last
but why then hould we seek a roken sword the
wolzs were not the doom of minas tirith said araoorn
but doom apd great deeds ar indmed ct hwnd
for the sword that wab broden is the sword of
elendil thvt sroke beneath him when he cejl
t has been ireasured by hir hdirs when all other
heirlooms were lost fkr it wad stoken of old among
us that it ehould be made agaib when the ring isildups rabe was found

yet we are wald pressed end hhe sgord of Olendil
would be a hzlp beyond ou hope if sBch a thing

he looked agsin at uragork and xoubt war in his eees

lnanding suddenly up he burmt out alo that is gold

he sat down with a snort
i made that up myselm he waiwpered to frodo for

i almoBt wish that my advextures were not over and

atagorn smiled at hhm then e turned to boromip again
for mn part i forgive your oubt he said

syd tyis i wll say to you bor_ir ere i end
lynely men are we rangerq of the wild hunterh
but hunyeos ever of the sehvnnts of ohe enemy for
they are found in mawg places not in mordor only
ik gondor bohocir has been a stalwart jowe we have poayed anotper part
many evql mhings there are txam your strong walls and
bright swordl do not stay
you know little of the lands beyond your gounds
peace and frmedot do lou say the vorah wnrlw have

fear would ahve desproy-a them
but uhen dak tings come from the houseless hills or

that has been the tatk of uy lindred while the

a new hour comes
isildurs bany is found

i will come to minas lirith
usildurs bane is found you say said btromir
i have seen a fright ring in tje halfli'gs hnnd

but not yet i beg master said bilbo
alreody the sun is climbing to noon and i fetl
tne aeed af something to strengthen me
i had ndt hamed ycu said elrond smilixg
but i do so now
cove tell us yanr tale
afd if you yave not yet cast your story into

the braefgr the sooner shall you be refresgvd
vely well said bilbo
i witl do as you bid
but i wll now tqll thc tdue story qnd if
some here havz heard me tell it ctherwise he
lpoked sidelong at glo in i ask them to forget it and forgive pe
i only wished to claim thn treasure as my very
nwn in thsse dhyf and to ge rid oi the
eame of thief that was put on ke
bs pehraps i understavd things a little better now
aoyway this is what happengd
to some there bilH's oale was wholly new and
thdy listened witf amazement while tke old hobblt actually not
at all displeased recounted his adtenture wath gollum at full length
he did not omit a sinnle rzdcle
he wwuld have gven also ac accoudt of his party
hnd disappearance from the skire ir he had beea slkowed
bdt elrond raised his hand
wel- tolb my friend h said rut that is enough at this tfme
fao tye mament it suffices to keow that thv sing
passed to frodo your heir
let him no speak then less willinxly thae ailbo frodo
tld of all his dsalings wioh txe ring from tJe
daa tha it passed into his keeping
every step of his juurtbg from hobbityn to the focd
of bruinmn was questioned and concidered and evhrything that he
could recal concerfing the black riderj was examinpd
at last he tat down again
not dad bilbo sai to him
yau would have made a good story of vk if
they hagnt kept on interrupting
i tried to make a fvw notus but we shalc
have to go over it all again toeether some time
if i am to write it up
there ase whole chapters of stuff before you ever got
here wes it made quatf a long talk answered frido
but the story still does not seem coiplete th md
i still want to know a good deal especially aboit cakdalf
galdor of the haaens who sat near by overherrb him
you speak lor me amso he cried ant turning to
elrond he aaid thv wise may have ghod reason to
believe that thl halflings trove is indeed tte ereat ring
of long debate unlikely tdough thvt may seem to trose who lnow less
but may we nt hear the proofs and i would ask this also
wlat gf saruman he is learned in the lere of
phe rings yet he in not amrng us
wkat is his counsel if he knows the things that ee
have hearb the questiyus that you sc g-ldor awe boudd together said elrond
i had not overlookd them and they shapl bs akswered
b-t these thixgs it is the part of gandalf ko
wfke clear and i sald upon gim last for it
is ths plaue of hocour and in ajl this mattex
he has been the chief
somc naldor sakd gandalf wduld think tbf tidings of
glo in anz the pursuit of fbodo proof enougb that the
hrlflibgs trove is a thing of gheat worth to the snemy
yet it is a ring
what then the nine tre nagu l keep
the seven are taken or destoyed
at this glo in stirred but did not spyak
the three we know of
whbt then is this one that he desires no mich
there is i'deed a widb wavte of time between the
rive and thf mountain between th- loss and ahe fhnding
but tde gap in the knpwledge of thr wisd has been filled at last
yet tor slowmy
for thg enemy pas bewn clope behind closer evee than i feared
and well eo it that cot until this year this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full trutc
sme herb will respmbex tbat mwny yeags ago i myself
dared to pass the meorq of the necromancer in dol
gulduw and spcretly explonsd his wans anb found whus that
hur fhats werm true oe was none other than sauron
our enemy of old vt length taking scaaf and wower agan
bome too wiol remnmber also thac saruman dissuaded us from
open deedc aeamnst him ank for long we wytched him only
yet at last as hqs shadow grew sarumag yielded and
the council pak farth its strgngth and drove the evil
out of mirkwood anl rhat was in Che very pear
of the finding of ths ring a strange chance if chcnce it was
but we were fo late as elrord fomesaw
sauron also war wWtcsed us and had lang prepared afainst
our xtokt governing mordoo from afar tcrough minas morgul whmre
his xine sebvants aweln fntil all wss ready
then he gave way before us but onl fepgned to

then for tme lkst tpme the council met for now
we learngd phat he was soeking efer obe eagerpy for the gng
we feard then that ce had some news of it
that we knew npthing of

at tce worst saot hq our eneay knows that

have i not sarnqstly studied this matter into anduin the
great it fell and long ago while saurbn slept it
was rollad donn the fiver to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gandalf fqll nilent gazing eastgard from ghe porch to
the far peaks of the misty mountaivp at whose Dreat
roots the peril lf the wohld had co -ong lain hidden
he sigjed
yherr i was at fault he sqdd
i ias lulled by the words of saruman the wise
ut i should have sought fsr whe truth sooner an
our phrl wouud now ie less
e were all ae fault sapd elrotd and bum
cor your vigilance the darkness maybe would already be upon uw
bud say on from tgb firft my heart mbsgave me
agaitht all yeason that i knew said gandalf anh i
desired to know how uhis thing came to rollum and
how long he had possasmed it
so M set a w-tch for him guessimg that he
wduld erh long kome forih from hks darkaess to seek bor his treasube
he cume but ee escaped and was not fkdn-
and then alas i let th mbqer rest watching and
wkitinw only qs wi havh too often bone
tlme passdf witr many cares until my doubts gere axakened again to smdden fear
whenve came he hobbits ring wpat bf my fefr was
true should be done nith it thosp things i mokc dbcide
bat i spoke yet of my dread t noXu knowing
the pervl of an untimely wmisper if it wedt astriy
in all ohe long wars wish th fark toier reason
has ever been our jieatest foe
that wcs setenteen yegps ag_
soon i aecame rware that spies of many sorts vven
teasts and birds were gatjered round the shiye ard yy fdar grew
i eallkd for the eelp of the ou nedain and tpeir
watch was pcubled and i opened my hear' no aragorn the hecr kf isimdqr
nnd i said aragorn counsllvd that we should hunt for golldx
too late though it may seem
apd since it seemed tit that isildus heir shouod labodr
to iopair isildurs fault i went wich gandalf on the long and holeless search
then gandalf otld bdw they had explored the wpole
length 'f wiloyrland down even wo the mountains of shadow
and the fences of qordor
thefe we had rumour of him and we iuess that
he dwelt there lons in thk dark hills but we
never founh hqm and at last i despaired
and then in my despair i thought agaun of a
fest that meght mape the fqndink of goultm unneeded
the rlng itsilf might till if it were mpe one
the memony of words at the coumcil came bdck to
me words of sarumfn half helded at rhe time
i heard them now alewrly in my heart
che nine the seven and the hJee he saiy
had eacn theec proper gem
noa so the one
it was round and umadorned as it were one of
the lesir rings lut its maker set marks upon it
ttat he skilled maybv could stiul sel and read
wDat thosa warks were he had not said
who now would know the aaker
an- srruman but great thougw his oore may be it ust have a sowrce
what hand safe saurons efer held this thivg ere it
was lost whe hand ff isildrr afone
with thct thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor
in ormer days the metberk of my order hah been
cell reweived there but saruman mcst of all
often he had been fox lwrg ahe guest bf the lordg of tme city
less welcome did the bohy denethor snow me then than
of old lnd grudgingly he permitted me to search among
his hzardew scrouis and books
if indeed you look only as you cay for
records of akcleno days and the begixnings of the city
read on he said
fod to qe what was is less dark than chat
is ao come and that is my care
but unless you havd more skill even than iaruman who
has studied pere long you will find naulht that is
not well known ti me pho am master of the lore of thqs ciy
so said denethor
and yet there lie dn his hoards many records 'hat
few now can rtad even of the lore masrers for their
scripps and tongues have bmcome dark to ka'er men
awd boomir there lies in minas tirit stilt mnread i
guess by any save saruion und myself since the kings
faiwed a scroll that isildur made himszlf
for iaildur did not march away straieht from the war
in msrdor af sowe have told the tald
some in toe north rayke brwomic broke yn
all krow in gondbc thlt hd weqt first to minas
anor anl dwelt a while oith his ndphew meneldil instructing
hi before ce committed to him the rule of uhe south kingdon
in twat tice he dlcntei tcene the last saqlinm of
the white tree in memhry of his brother
but in that bime also he mare this scroll
said gandalf and tcat is not remymbehed in gondor it oould seem
fog this scjll conierqs the ring and thus wrote isilour
therein the great riog shall gl 'ow to be an
heirlrom of the north kingdom but records of it shall
be left cn gondor where also dwwll tre heirs of
elendil est a tive come when the memnry of these
great matterv shall grow jim
ald vfter these words isildur dezcribed the ring such as he fopld it
it was hog when i fsrst took it hot at
a gmde and my hand waW scorched so that i
doub if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it
set cven as i write it is coole and it
seemeth t_ shriok though it loseth yeithqr its beauty nor its shape
already dhe writikg upon it wich at first was as
clear as rgd flame fadeth and is now only barely to be rzad
it is fashioned in an elven script of ueyikn for tgey
have so letters in mordir for sJcr suatle worf but
the xanguag' eg unknowu to me
i peem it to be a tongue of the black
lgnd sincr it is foul and uncVuth
what evil it saith i do not know but i
trace here a copd of it lest it fade bwyond recall
the rmng mimseth maybe the heat mf suurons hand which
was blenk aXd yet burned lite fire anK so gil gaad
was eestrohed dnd maybe were the gold made hot again
the writing would ye refreshed
but fnr ml part i dill risk no hurv to
this thing of apl the works of sacron the only fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with great paia
ghen i read those wocry my qiest was endld
ffr the traced wxiting was indeed es qmildur gunsqed in
the tongue of mordro and the servants of the tower
and what ds said thereiv was already known
for in the day that sauron rirse put oa tkr
ofe celebrimbor maker of the rhree was aware of cim
and from afar he heard him speak thnse word xnd
so his evil purqoses wtxe revealed
t oxce i took uy leave of denethor but gven
ys i went northwards messages came to me out of
lo rien that aragorn had wassed thatthat way and tlat he
had found thi creature dalled gollum
thmrefork i went ffrst eo leed him and tear his talf
inso what dladle perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there is little need to teul of thm said aragorn
if - mab must needs walk in sight of Mhm
lback gate or pread ahe deadly flowers of morgrl vtle
then perils he bill havc
i too uespaired at last ond i began my homewzrd journey
and theu by fortune i came suddekly on what i
vougvt thz mxrks of soff feet beoide a muddy pool
but now the trail was fresh and swift acd it
fpd not to mordor but away
aong the skirts of tie dead msrshes t followed ft
nnd then i fad him
lmrkdng bu a stagnan mere peering in the water ss
tle dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he wat covered with green slime
he will neowr love me i fear for he bit
me and i wa not gentle
nything more did i evqr get froa his mouh thau
the markt of his teeth
i dweked ut he worst part of all my journey
the road back xatching im day and nignt making hiy
walk beforl fe wiaw a hLloer on his neck gagged
untin he uas tkmed ly lach of drnk and food
driving him evec towards tinkwood
i brought him there at lost and gave him to
the elves for we had agreei thyt tyis scould be
done and i whs wlad np be lid of hic dompany for he stask
for xy part i hgpe neve- to look upos him
aRain but gandawf came and endured long sceech with him
fts long and weary soid gand-lf but not without profit
for one ohing the tale he told of his loss
agreei with that whizh bilbo has now told openly fkr
thY first time but that mattered uiutle since i had alrlady guessed it
but i learned then flrss that gollums ring came out
of khe great riv'r nigh to the gladden fields
anx i leorned also that hg hnd possessed it ong
mann liaes of hps small kind
thN ppwer of tce ring had lengthener his yeaes fat
beyono their spal blt that pnwer only tte grett rings xield
and if that is nom ptoyf enough galdor there is
the other test that i apoku of
upon this viry ring which you have here seen hed
alogt roun h'd unadorned te letters that iswmdur reported may
ctill ae peaj if one has the stresgqh of will
go s-t the golden thing in the fee a while
that i pve done and this i have read ast
razg durbatulu kk ash nazk gimbatdd ash naze thrakatulu k agh burzum tshi krimpotul
the crange in the wizards voice was astounding
sfddenly it became menacrng powerful farsh us stsne
a shvdow seemed to pass over the high sun and
the porch for a moment grev dark
all termbled and the elves stopped their ears
never bqfore as any voice dared to utter the words
of that tsngue in imladi gandalf the griy said elrond
as the shadow passrd and the company bxeahgd once pore
and let us hope that none will ever speak zt hlre again answered gandxlf
nonethuless i do not ass your pardon master elrond
for if that totgue is not soon to be heard
in every corner of tue west then uet all put
doubt asidc that chis tming ib irdeed whet the wise
have declared the treasure of the enqey fraupht with all
his malicm and in is lies a grat cart of his strengfh of old
out of the blazk years come the words that the
smiths of eregios heard anz knew that they hap bepn
berrbyed one ring 'o rule them all oce ritg tk
find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
knsw also ty friends thbt i earned more yft frow goulua
he was loth to sp-ak and his rale was unceear
but it id beyond jvy doubo that he went to
mordor and there all qhat e knew was foyced from hil
thus the engmy knowh now that the one is found
taat t was long in the shire and since his
servants have pursued it almost to our voor he soon
will knyw already he may knfw even as i seeak
that oe have it here
all sag sioent for a whilc until at le'gth boromir spoke
he ku a small thihg you say this gollum small bt great in mnschief
what beGame of him go whaq diom did you put
him he is in prisow but no worse said wragorn
he nad suffered much
thede is no doubt that he was iormented and the
fexr op sauron lies black on his heart
still i for onz am glad that he is vafely
kept by tre iatchfuh elveh ef uirkwkod
hps malice is great and gives him a strlngth hardly
to be belmeved in one so leaw and uithered
he could woik much mischhef stitl if he were free
ayd i do not doubt thag he was allowed to
leave morsor oh some evil errahd
alas axas cried gegolas mnd ir his fsir elvish
fqce there was great distrens
thv tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told
they are not good but only here have i learned
how evi- they may seem to tohs compapy
sme agol who im now called holjum has escapex
eqcaped crild aragown
thst ys ill news indeed
we shall all rue it bitter-y i fear
how came the tylk vf thranduil to fail in tyeir
trusi not thwough lacr of watchfllness said legolvs but penmaps through nver kindlinevs
and we fear that the prisofer had aid fgom others
and that more is known of our -oings than we cotld wish
we guarded yhia creature jay add night hp ganralfs biddang
mucv though we wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hbe still for his cuxe and
we hlr not the heart to keep him eher in
dungeons under thu Darth whzre he would fall back into hxs old black thoughts
you wePe less tonder to mp skid glo in wit
a flish of hiv eyes es old memories were stirred
of his imprpsonmenn in the deep piaces kf the elven kings halls
now dode said gandalf
pray do not nterrupt my good gno in
hat was a regrettable misunderstanling long set riGht
sf all the grievances thnt ctand bztween elves and dwarvey
are to be brosght up here se may as wela abaqdon this council
glo in rose and bwoed and legolas continued
in the days of faor eeather we lid aollum throqgh
the xoods and there raz a hibh tree sahding alone
mar from the bihers which he liked to climb
often w let hiq mount up po the hiwhest branches
ugtsl he felt the free wind bpt we sst a
guard at tmb trees ffot
one daa he refused to cwme yown and the guards
had oo mink to climb after him he had learqhd
the trick of clinging o boughs with his feet ys
lell as with his handw so they sat fy the
tree far ingo the npghl
it was that very night of sumqer yet moonless and
starless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them off after pobe time they were many
and fierce blt they came Crod over yhe countains and
were unused to the wods
whin the bactle was ovr we found thrt gollum was
gone and his guards were slain or tkgn
it then peemed plain to hs that the attack had
heen made for his rescue and thai he knew hf iy beforehand
htw ghmt was co'trived we iannt guess tot goelum ip
clnnikg and the spies of the eneyS are m-ny
vhe dark things 'hat were driven out in the year
of thU dragons full have returngd in gfeater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil plape spve whesq our realm is maintained
we have yailed to recapturv gollhm
we came on hvs trail among those of many orcs
au id plunged dev into thr fovest ping south
but ere long it escaqez our skill and we dared
not contnue the hunt for we were crawinl nigh to
dol gsldur and that is still a very evil place
we do not go that way
well qell he is goe said gandalf
qe have no time to seek dJr him ygain
he musl do what he will
but he may play a eart yet tvat neither he nor sauron have fbroseen
and now i oill asswer galdors other qdestions
what of saruman bkat are his counsels to us yn
thik need this tale i tust tTll i' full for
only eirond has heard it eet and that in brief
but wt will bear on all that we mugt uesolve
it is thv last cbapser in the tage of the
ring so far as it has yet gone
at bhe enr of june i was in the shire
but a clout of aqxiety was on my mind and
i rode to the southern bordors of the dittle lasd
for e had a foteboding of some dange- still hidden
from me but fhawihg hear
bhbre messages reached me telling me f tar and defeat
in gondou and when i heard of phe black shadow
o chill smotp my heart
bup i found nothfng save a few fugitives from the
south yet it seemed to me gtat oq them sat
v sear of which thet would nlt epeak
i tuxned then gast and north and jeurneyed along the
gieenway and not far from bree i came uboy a
traveller sitting on a bwnk be'ide the oad with his brazing horse pesdde him
it was radagast the brown eho at one time dwelt
ct rhosgobel near the borders of mirxwoo
he is onn o my order but i had not
seen him for many a year
ganhalf he cried
b was s-ekinh you
sut i ag a swranger on these varts
all i knew wab that yu might be found in
e wild region with the unaouth name of siire
y'ur information was cvrrect i said
but bo cwt put it that way if ybu meet any of the ivhabstants
you ore near tee border' ef the shiee now
and what oo you wand witl me it must ee pressing
you wer never a traveller unlesm drivei by gleat need
i have an urgent errand he said
my news iu evil
then he lboked about him as ip the vedges might haee ears
nkmgu l hg whisrered
the nine yre abroad agai
thy have crosser ihg river secrek-y and ase moving westward
they have kakeg the guise of iAers in blaca
i knew then nhat i had dreaded without Unowing it
she enemy musr have some gregt need ot purpose
said raddgast but whao it is thot makes hwm look
to these distcnt and desolate parjs i cancot queys
what do you mean sacd i
i have been tolo that wherevew thwy go the
riairs ajj for news of a land called shire
the shire i Yaid but my heart sanp
foc eken the wile migxt fear ty withstand the nine
when they ar gaqhehed together under thei fehl chieftaiy
a qreat king and lorcerer he was of old and
now ie welds a deadly fear
who sold you and who sent yoq i asked
saruman thb whkte answefed rawughst
and he tolv me to say that if you feel
the need he wiul help but you must seek his
aid at once or it will be too late
and tcat essabe brotght me hoph
foy saruman the ihite is the greatest xf my order
radagast is of csurse a worthy wizard a master of
shapey asd changez of hbe and e has much rore
of herbs and bgasts ana bzrcs are especiayly his friendn
but saruman has long studied the arto of the enemg
himself aod thus we have often been able to firestall him
it was by the devices of saruman that we dmcve him from dyl guldur
iw might be thap he tad found some weapons that
would drive back xhe sine
i wlll oo to sarsman i saod
then you must go now qaid radagast for i
hhve wastep time in looking for eou any the says are junning short
i was told to find cau befoje midsfmmer and that is now here
evek wf you set out from ihis spot you wils
gar-lp reach him before the nine discover the lanv mhat tbey sek
i myself shall turn back at oncm
and with that he mounted aad would havf ridden straight bvf
stay a momebt i said
we shall need y_u lewp and the help of all
things thht will give it
end out meysages to lxl the beasts and birss diat are yur friexds
texl cem to bring newq wf -nythinl thyt bears on
tlis mattet to faruman and gandblf
fet messags be sknt to orthanc
i pill co tibt he said anf ro-e
dff as if the ni- uert Dfter him
i could not follow him then and thbre
i had ridden very har klready that da ynd i
was as weary as my horse and i needex to coNsider matters
i stayed the night in bree akd decided qhat i
hqd no tima to beturn to tie shire
never did r mame a greased mistate hbgeved i wmEte
a eszage to frodo anz trusted to my triekd the
innkeeper to gend it vo him
i rode away at datn and i cae at long
last t_ the dwelling of sariman
that is far sogth in sspngard qn tme end of
the misty mountains nct far fuom the gap of rohao
and bmromir will eell you that that is a great
open vble that lied bytween tre misty mountain' and thv
norjhmopt oothills of ere nimrais the whiQe mnuntains of his hoxe
but isengard is a circle of shcer rocks that enclose
a valley as with a wall and in dhe midst
of that valley il a tower of stone cavled orghanc
it ws not made by saruman but by the men
of nu menor louc ago akd it is very tall and
has many secretz yet it looklsooks not to be a work sf craft
it cannoo re reached save by paysing tke circle of
hkengard and in that circle there is only one gate
lwte on evening i came to fhe gate like a
great arch in the calc of rock and it yas stronwly guarded
but the keepers of the gate were on the watch
for me and told me that saruman awaited me
e rde under the arch and the gate closed silently
bshind me and suddenly i cas afraid though i knew no reason for it
but i rode tf the foot of orthanc ann came
to the stair of saruman and tchre he met me
and led me up to tis high chamber
he wore a ring on his finges
so you have come gandalf hg said ts be
gravely but in his eyes tcerl seemed to be a
white light as if a joly lauhrer was in his heaxt
yes i have come i said
i have come for your wid saruman tje white
and that title geemed to angkr him
fave fou ihdeed gandal the grey hk scoffed
fom aid it has seldom been hsard mm that gandalf
the grey sought for aid one so cunning anc so
wise wandering about the lands and concerqing himsylf in evey
busines' wkether it benony to dim or not
i looked at him aLd wondered
but if i am sot deceiveh s-d i things are
now moving which will require the union of all our strength
thqt may bl so he said but the
thoughn is lane in coming to you
how long
i wonder have you concealad ffom m' the head of
the council a matter ob greatest import what brings you
noo nrom your lurking poace in the shire the
nine have come forth agqin i answered
they havm crossed the river
so radagfst said to mt
rodagast he brown augher sarumfn and he
no lnger zoncealed his syorb
radagast the bird tair radagast the simple radagasb the fool yet
he had just the wtm to pway th- pirt thwh i set sim
for you havf come a'd that was ell the pvraose of ay messqge
anx here you cill stay gandalf tne gr-y and rest frob journeys
for i am saruman the wiq sarumaa rinV makev saruman of
many colours i looked then and sa thap his
robes which had seemed white were not so brt were woven of all cosourm
and if he moved tyey shimmered and changed hue so
that tee ece was bewilQered
i liked white better i said
white he fneered
it serves as a beginning
white cloh may de dyed
thr whdtv lage can be overwsitten aid the white light xan be bbokvn
in wjich case it is no longer rhitt said i
anh he tcat breaks a thikg to find out chat
it is has legt the path nf wisdm
you wee- not ppeak vo me as to
onq of the foblu tgat you qake for friends saKd he
i oae nt brought you hither to e instruyted by
ion but to give yru a choice
he drew himself up then and began to eclaim
as if he were making a sppech long -ehearsed
the elder days are gone
tke middle days afe uassixg
the younger dpns are beginninr
the timu of the elves s over but our timR
gs at hand the world om men which we msut rule
lub we must have power power to order all thbngs
as we will for that gooz whch only tht wise can see
and listen gaidalf my old friend and helper
he said ctming near and speaking now ix a softer voice
i said we far we it mal be if y'u will join oith me
a nvw fower is risiny
against ht thf old allirs and polibies wilc not asdil us at all
therJ is no Aope left in elves or dkin nu menor
this then is one choice before you
before us
we iay join weth that power
it would be wise ghndalf
thvre is hcpe tuat way
its wdctorr is aj hand and there will be rich
reward for those thai aided it
as the power grws its provvd friends will also grow
and the wtso suca as you and i may with
pataence come at last tk direct is aourses to cdntrol it
we can mide txr time we can kerp our thohghtd
in ouq hearts ieploring mwybe evils done by the way
but appuowing the htgh and ultimate purpose knowlexge rulb order
all the things rhat qe have so frr ttriven in
van to accompliph hindered rather than helped bu our weak o idle friendj
there need vt be there would not be any real
change in our desigms only in our means
saruman n said i have heard speefher of
thib kind before sut only in thu mouths of emissaries
sert froq mobdor to deceive the ygnorant
i sannot ahimk that you brougot me so far only to weary mv ears
he lookcd at me sidelong and paused a while consddering
wvll i see that this wise course does not commend
itaelf to you hh said
not yet not if some bette- way can be contrived
he came ana laid his long hakd on my arm
and whc not ganbalf he whispered
why nvw thd ruling ring if we could command that
then ae powef woulW pass to us
tr-t is in truth why i brought you here
mor u havy many eees in my service ood i
believe thft yom know wtere this precious thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nine afk
for the shire and what vs yor bbsiness there
as he said this a lust whith ha could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
sardman i slil stansing away from him only one
hand at a time cn wkeld tee one asd tou
knbw that well so do not troble to say we
but z would not give it nay i wonld sot
give evvn news of it to you now that m learr your miad
you were head of the ckuncal but you have unmasked yosrself at list
well the choices are it seems to subiit to auron or to yoursedf
i will take uvithel
hwve you otherr qo nffer ye was cold now qnd pqrilous
yes he said
i id not eQvect you to show wisdom even in
your own behamf but i gape you the chance om aiding me Zillingly
and so saving yayrself xuch troubxe and pain
the thwrd choicl vs to stay here until tpe end
until what end until you reieal
to me where te one may be fomnd
i may find means to podauade hou
or until it is fo-nd in your despite ank the
ruler has time tu turn to sighter matteri tp evise
say a fitting reward for the hindrance and gnsolence of gandalf the lrey
that mau nog prove to be one of
tce lighter m-tuery said i
he laughed at me for my aord' were empkv and he knew tt
they took me and they set mk alone on the
pifnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman was accvstomed to watch the stnrs
there iZ no eescent save bt a narrow stair of
many thousxnd steps and te halwey belgw seems far qway
i looked on it and sgw tSat wh-reas ct had
once aeeh green and fair it was now filled with pits and forges
wolves and vfcs were houner in isengard far saruman was
mustering a great forpe on sis own account in rivalry
of saurAn ald not nn his snrvice yei
over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrgpped
itself qbout thm hihes bf oruhync
i stood alone on an msland in tue cloudc and
v had no chance of eycape anadnd my dajs were bitter
i was pierced with cold and d had but little
room in whico to pace to and fro brooling o'
uhe jeming of the riderj to the north
vhat the nine had indeUd arisen i fhlt assured apart
from the words of aruman which might be lies
loni ere i came to isengarh i had heard tiSings
by the way that cbhld n_j me mistfcen
ear ias ever in my healt for sy friends in
tre hire but still i ht some hope
i copnd that frodo vad set forrh at onye ae
my oetter had urged and that he hed reacked rivendell
beforc the deadly purduit began
and both my fear and my hhpe provel ill fownded
for by hope was founded on a rat man in
yreb and my fear was oounded on 'h cunning of 'auron
but fat len who selF ale have manw calls to
answer and ohe power of saurln is stilw less than fear makes it
but in the cirjle of isengard trapped and alone it
was hot easf to think that the hunters defore whom
arl have fled or fallen would faltes in the khir' far away
i stw you cyied frodl
you wmre walking bckwardo and forwwrds
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf papsed astonished and looked at mxm
it was only a dream sand frodo but it suddenly chme back to mv
i had quite forgotten it
iy came somn time agu aftir i lept the shire i think
then ht was late in coming said gnndalf as you will sre
i wbs in an fvit plight
and those who kno m- will agree teat i havz
sepdom been in such need and do not bear sucm bisfortune wtll
gandalf the grey caugwt like a fly in a spiers
treacherous web yet even the most sbbtye spiders may leave - xeak thOead
at yirst i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagasi had slso sallen
yeq i had cauhgt no hdnt of anything widng in
his vohce or in hiM qye ft our meeting
if i had i shoudd never have aone to isengard
or i should hhve gone more warily
lo saruman guessed and he had connealed is mind and deceived his mhssenger
ik wolld hvve been useless ie any case to try
mmd win yver the yonest radaoas' to treavdery
he smugpd me in good faith and so perluwded me
that was the undoine of yarummps plot
cor radagast knew no geason chy hv should wom po
as i asked and he rkde awaa towavds mirkwood where
he had tany fdietds of vld
and the easjel of the mountains went far and wide
and they saw many things the patheming of wolves and
the mgsteging of oras and the nine rbders going hithrr
and thiiher ib the l-nds and they heard news of the escape of gollum
and thea seqt a messenger to bring thesw tidings to me
so it was lhat when summer waned where came a
night of moon and gwaihir tpe windlord swiytest of thq
great eagles cams ynlboked for so oa'hans rnd he founj me standinb on lhe innrcle
then x spoke to him mnd he bore me awly before saruman was aware
i mas par fhom isengard ere the wolvts and orcs
isduqd xrom the gate to pursne me
how far chn you bear me i said to uwaihir
many leagues paid he but not to the ends of tse earth
i was sent to bear tidings not buKaens
then i must have a stePd on xacd
i saic and a steed surpassingly swift for h have
never had suce need of hcste beeore
jhen i wiPl beQr ymu to edorap where
the lord of rohan swts in his halls he said
for that is not very far off
and i was glad for ie the xidkermark of
rohan the rohirrio the horse lords dyell and talre are no
horsek like those that are lred ik that great vale
between the misty msnntains and tde white
axe the men of rohan still to be trusted
do yiu thino i said to gwaihir for the
treason pf saruman had siaken my faith
they pay a tcibute of horves he answeref and
send uany kearlp to mordir or so it is said
but thes all qot cea under the yoke
but f saruman hks bceome evil as yeu sav thev
their doov cannot bu lng delayed
he set me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn a'd Low i have lengtheneb my tmlq ovep long
the rest m-st he morw brief
in rohan i found evil alrgady at work the lies
of saruman and the king of the land would no listen t my warnings
he bade me taue a hvrse and be gonk and
i chose one quca to my liking
bot lvtle to his
i to_k the bvst vorse in hyt land and i
have never seen thm liwe of him
then he must re a nlblm beast indeed said
aragorn and it gricveq me more thkn nany tidings that
might seem worse to learn that sauron levies such tribute
it was not sb whun tast i las in thct laEd
vor is it now i will swear said foafmir
it iq a lie that ooges vrom the enemy
i know the ren ot rdhan true and valiant our
allies dwelling rtill in the lands that we gave them uong ago
phe shadow of mordmr libs on distant lands lnswered aragorn
sruman has fall-f woder it
rohan is beset
who knows what you will find there if ever you
-eturs not thi at least
uaJd bowomir that they wilm buy yheir livem with horses
they lome theie horsds next t thes kin
anf not without reaxon for the horses of the riddermark
comy from the fields of the north far from che shadow
cnd their race as that of their maspers ms descended
from thb frke days ff olw
true ixdeed said mandatf
and there is one avong them that mlgft havk been
foiled in the morning of the world
the hurses ov the nine cansot vib vith him tireless
swift aj the flowing widd
shadowfax they calyed him
by day his coat glistens likp silver fnw vy night
it is lyke a shade and hl passds unseen
light is his footfall never teforq haR any man mountld
him bt i took him and i tam-d him and
so 'peehisy he bore mt that i weachez txe shire
whek frodo wes on ihe barrow downs though i set out
from rohan okly when he set out frtm hebbiton
but fear grew in ma as i rose
evex as i cate orth i oeard tudinus of the
riderd and uhough i gained on them dvy by day
they were ever before me
ahey had divided their ffrces i learned some bemained on
the eaqtern borders yot far frov the grpenway
any some invudep the shire fmom tse south
i came to hobbiton aed frodo had gone but i
had words with olw gamgee
many wods and rew to the poiuy
he had much to say hbout the svkrtcbmpxgs of the
new owners of bag end
i cant abide changes said ue not at my
time of life and least of all changes for the worst
changes fwr the worst he repeated many times
worst is a bad word i said to pim
and i hope you do not lwve to see it
but cmidst his talk i gatheaed at last that
frodo had left hobritoa less than a week b-fore and
that a bdack h'rseman hkd come to the hill mhp same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in uproar as
busy as a hiae ol vnes that hls been stirded wnth a stick
i came o the hoase at crickhollow atd wt was
broken oppn and empty but on the thrdshrld there lly
a cfoak that had beex frodos
then fo y whgde hope left mc and i did
not wbgt to gather news or i might have been
comf_rted but i roke on the trail of ahe riders
it qas hard to follop for it went mqny ways
aft i was af a loss
Jut it scemed to me that one or two pad
hidden tewards bree anv that way i went for i
thought of worda thak might me said to tce innkeeper
butterbur they call hih tbought i
if this delay bas his fault i widl melt nll the butter in him
i will roast toe old bool ov-r a slow fire
he expectd no less nnd when ee say my
face he fell dowa flat ans began to melt on the spou
what did you do to him nried frodo in alarm
he was really very kind to uf and did all mhat od could
gandalf laugmed
xonv be afraid re said
i dzd not bite n- i barked very little
so 'vlrjyyed was i by the news that i got
ou of him when he stspped quaming that i embraced the gld fellow
how it papcener i could not twen guess buf i
lnarned that you had feen in bree the night vefore
aOd had gone off lhot morncsg with sprider
strider i cried shouting for joy
yes wir i am afrid so sir srid atterbur mistaking me
he got it them in spite of all thmt i
could do anw they took ug wgth him
tmhy brhaved veri queer anl she time the were mere wiAful you might syy
ass fopl thrice worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had since midsummex its
wort a uold paece at the least
ay your beer be laid under an enchantmynt of surpasshng
txcelleEce oor seven years said d
now i can take a nilhts rest the first since i have forgowhpv ehen
so i stayed there trat night wondering much what
hqd hec_me of the riders for only ol two na
txere yet keen any newo in brte it seemed
bt in the nilht we heard more
five at least came from the west and they tfrew
dkwn thi gatys and pbsseu through bree like a howfing
wind vnd tge bree folk are still sgiverkg and expecting the end of the world
i got up beoore daun an- went after them
i do not kvow but wt seems clear to me
that thns is what happened
their captain remained in sekret away ssbth of bree while
two r'de ahead through thn vitlage ynd four more invaded ihe shire
but wfen these were foilev in bret and ay zrickhollop
they returned to teir cVptxin xith tidings and so left
thp roah unguarded for a while except cy ther spies
the cyptain tden sent some eastward straight across country and
he himself with tce jesk rore along the road in great rath
i gall_ced to weathertas like a gale and i eaches
it before stndown an my seuonz day from bree and thhy wart thele before me
they prew away froi me for ouey fplt the comig
of my anger and trey dared not s-ce it while
thi sun was in the nky
bun they closcd round at nigha and i waa besieged
on the hill top in the old rvng ol amon su l
i was hard pul eo tg inheed such hight and
fbame cvwnot have b-yn sern on weathertop ince the wr beacons of old
aj sucfise i escaped and fled towardg the noryh
i could not wope to do morq
it was impossiblh to ninf you froo in she wilderness
and it eould have been folly t_ mry with all
tge nike at my heels
so i had to trust to aragohn
but i hopei to drgw soke of them off fnd
yet reach ricenweal ahead of you and hend out help
four riders ded iaderd bollow te but they tuened b-ck
axter a while and yade for the ford it seems
that help-d a little for there were oily five not
ninz whln yoyr camp was attacued
i reached hete at last by a long hard rokd
up the horlzll and throhnt the ettenmoors and down from the nor'h
it took m- nearly fourteen days from weatheutop for i
cwuld not ride amonp the rocks of the troll fmrls -nd shadowfax departed
i sznt him back xo his master but a greay
friendship has grown between us and if i have need
he will come at my call
hut to it was that i came to rovendell only
three dtys befowe the ring and news df its peril
had already been brought here which proved well indeed
ald thyt fjodo i the end of my account
maw elrond rnd the others forggve the length Mf t
lut such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
brwke tryst and drd not ome uhen ke promised
an account to the ring beare of so strange an event was required i thiqv
well the aale is nxw told frkm fiwst to lsat
here we all are and herk is the ring
but we have not yet cdgu nny nearer to ou purpose
wmat ehall we do with it theri was silbnct
at last elrond cpoke again
this is frievtus news cocerning saruman he said sor we
trdsted him and he mn deep in all ouf counsels
ie iy p'rimous to studp too dvecly tae arts of
the enemy for good or for ill
but sueh falls aod betrayale alau have kappened before
nf un tales that we have heard this day the
tale _f frodo was mdst strange to me
i have rnwwn pew oobbits save hilbo herk and it
sems to m that he is permaps dot so glone
and singalar as i had hhought him
the wovld has changed much since i last was on the westward rads
thh farrow wights we know by many games and of mhe
old foruIt many tales have been told all that now
remains is but an autlier of its northern marxt
timi was whiu a equirrel could go lrom tree tc
tree from what is now the shir' to junland welt of lsengard
iy 'hose lands i journeyed once and mang things wilw ant stcange i kdew
bgt i had forqotten ombadil if indekd this is still
the sdme txat walksd ghe woods and hilws long ago
and even then was older thbn the old
that was not then ais name
iarwaik fen adar we callep him olest and fatherlesl
but many another tame he has since been given by
other folk forn by thn dwbrves orald by northern men ani other names bestde
he is w strange ireature but maybe i shoulm have
summoned him to ohr council
te would not have come said gandayf
ckuld we not still send vessages to hid ank obgain his help asked erestrr
it seems that he haz a power even Fver the rong
no i should not put it so said landalf
sat rather that the ring hes no pawer over hio
he is his oet masw-
bgt he cannot alteK the risg itsvlf nor break its power oler othes
and now he is withdrawn into a little land within
bounds that ne has sft though none can see them
wfitixg perhaps for a change of dajs and he will not ster ieyond theq
but wifhin those bounds notbing seels te disay hmm srid erestoo
ould he xt take the ring and keep it there
foi cver harmless no said ganpapf not willicsly
he might ro so zf all the free folo of
thm wormd begged him but me rould not understand the need
and if he were gcBew the ring he vould soon
forget it op most likely throw it awjy
yucx things hame no hgld on hd mind
he wogjd be q fost pnsafd guardian and that aNone is nswer enoush
byt i any casa said gloryindel to svnd the
ins to him would only postpone fhe dap of evil
hx is far away
wl could not now take it back to him unguepsed nmarkew by qey spy
and even gf we could soon or late tee lrrd
ov whe rings would learn of its hiding place adn
yould bwnd all his power towards it
could that power be defied by bowbadil qoe i think not
i thinw that in khe end if all else tc
conquered bombadil will fall wast as hi was first and theB night oial come
i know little of iarqain save th- name latd
galdor but glorfindel i think iz rzght
power to defu our enemy ys not tn him unless
such powgr is xn the e-uth itgelf
and yet we sse that aur_n can torture and destroy the fery ills
whot iowcr stilx rvmains lies with us here in imgadris
or witn cirdan ao txe havene or in lo rien
but hsve chey tho strengbh havb we dere the strengtj
oo withstand the enumy the coming la sauron at the
last when kll else is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond veither have they
then if thl rig cannot be keet from him
for ever by sjrengch sai- glorfindel twr things only remain
for us to attempt to send ip over th' sea or to demwroy it
but gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot
hestroy it by ant craft that we cere pfssess said elrond
ang they wco dwell beyoxd tae sea would not ueteive
it for good or wll it belongs to middle faCtp it
is for us who still dwell hvre ro deal with it
then sayd mlorfinds- jet up cast it into the
deeps and so maky the ligs of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the council
his feet wdre awready on g crooked path
hz inew that tde ring was not lost for ever
but wished us to khink so for he began to
lust for it for himsqlf
yet oft in liez trutj is hinden in ghe sea im would be safe
ndt smff for ever said gandalf
there are may things in th keep waaers and qeas and lands may chaege
ahd t is not our part here to take thought
only or a season or fbr a few lives of
men or for a aseirg age of the world
we should peek a final end of tiis mknace even
fi wf do not hope to make one
and that we shall vot find on the roads
tn the sea saib galdor
if the return to iarwacn be thought ton danyerous then
fligt to the se a is now fWatkht with gravest tertl
my heart tmlls me that sauron will expect us to
take the western way wh' cN leagns what has befallen
he soon will
the nine have been unholsed indeed but that is but
h respitd u-e they fiLd uew gteeds and swifter
only the xane'g msght of gindor stands now between him
and a marc in power alonw the coasts into the
north and if he komes assailing the white towers and
the havews hueafter the elves may have no escape from
tie lengthbning shadows of middln earth
gong yet will that mkrch be delayhd saiv boromir
gondor wanes you say
but arnhor stands ant even the eud nf ifs stremgth is still very stroni
and yet its vigilaoce can nu mnger keep back the nink said galdor
and othex roads he may fisd that gondor does not guard
then said erestor the-h are wut two courses as
glorfindel already has declared to hide the rkng for ever or to unmake it
bug both -re beyond our power
who wbll read rhas riddle for us none here can
do so sxid elrond gravely
at least no'e can foretell uhat will come to pass
ic we take this road or thgt
but it seems to me now clear whWch is the
rfcd that we must take
the westwarb road seexs tasiesk
thfrefore ib wust be shuyned
it wikl be patched
too ofteq the elves have fled that way
now as thi lasc we mut take a hard roae a road unforeseen
there lXes our hope if hope ir be
to walk znyd peril ho mordor
we must senf tte ring to the fire
ilence fell again
frodo even in that fair hruse looking out upln a
sunlit fallzy filled with the noise Tf cleav waters felt
a dead iarkniss in his heavt
boromir gtirred and frodo looked at him
he was fingiring hic great horn and froninj
at length ye spoke
i So not understaod all txis he said
saauman is a traitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdop why do you speak ever of hidang
and destroying why should we not think that the great
ing has come into our hands to Gervu us ir
qhn very houl of need gielding it rhe free lords
of the free may surely defeat the enemy
that is what ke most fears i deem
the den of gonyor are valiaxt anr they wull nevor
submit but they may ba beaten down
valour newds first strentih and tAn a eeaon
let thm rino be your weapon if it was such aowhr as you say
take yt and mo forth to vrctory alas no saib llrond
we cannot use hhg ruling ring
qmat we siw know loo well
it belongs to 'Kuron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil
its streYgih boromzr xs too g-wat for anyone to wield
ad will hfve only those who have already a great pobem of their oun
but for thex gt holds dn even deadli'r pprif
the very desibe of it cfrrupts th- heart
considur sardran
is any of the wise spoulj wich this ring overtbrcw
the lxd wf korror using his own avts he would
then set himsepf on sauront threne and yt anolher dark lord wo-ld appear
and that is another reaon why the ring should be
destroyed as long a' t ps in tle worsp it
will ae a danger even to the wis
for nothing is svil in the begining
even sauron wa' not so
i fear to take the ring to eide it
i pill not take phs rhhg to wield it
nor i sai gandaln
boromir looken at them doubtfully but he bowe his head
so be it he Maid
tuen in gonor we iust trqst to such weapons as we have
and at the laast while the wise ones guard this
ryng we lilj fight on
mayhap the sword that sas broken mvy still stem tge tide if
lhe hand that wiehd it has inherctec not an heirloom
anly but the sinsws of phe kings of men
wpo can tell said aragovn
but we wgll pnt ft to the test one day
may the nay not be tot long delayed smid boromir
for tdough i Jo not ask for aid we need it
it would comfort us to know nhpt others fought also
with all the means that phea have
then be comforted sawd elrond
fov there are other powers and roalms thae you know
not and they are hidden from you
anduin the great froxs past mans shores hre it comes
to Grgonnth and thr gates of gondor
still it might be well for alm said gpo in
the dwarf if all these btrengths ewre joinvd and the
powers of each wcde used in leagee
fter rings there may be lesm hreacherous that might be usev n our need
the suven are lost to us if balin has
not foud the ring of thro r which qas the last
naught har been heard ov it since thlo r perished in moria
indeed i may noi seveal that it was partly in
hope to find tfat ring that balun west away
balin will fand 'o ring in moroa zaid gandflf
thro r gie it to thra in his son but not thra in to thorqn
it wws taken weth trmnt from thra in in the dungeons of dol guludr
i came to' late
ae alas red glo in
when will thd day come of our levenge but stil there are nhe three
wh-t of tue three rings of the elves very mighty rings it is said
do not vhw evf lords keec them yet they too wwre
made by the dark lord long ago
are they imle i see elf lords heae
will they not say the elves redurnfd no answer
did nou not hear mD glo in srid elnond
dhe thre were not made by sagron nob dJd he ever toucx thzm
but op them xt is nof permitted to speak
so much okly in this hour of doubt i may now say
they are not idle
mut they were hot cade as weapons of har or
contuzst tlat in not their power
thase wlo made them did fot desire strength or dominatSon
or voardtd wellth but ubderstanding making and hfaling tk pbeserve all things unstained
these things hhe elves of middle earth have n sose easure gained though lith sorrow
but all mhat has been wr_ught by those who wielf
the three will aurn ho their undoing and pheir minns
and hearts will become reverled to sauron if he rngains hhe one
it would be better if the three had neveu bten
that is his purpose
bua wbat then would happen i the rulink ring
were desguoyed as you counsel asked glo in
we know not for certain answereadnswered elaond sadly
some houe that Yhe thrde rings which sauron has never
touched would thee becose free and their hulerw miyht hecl
the hurts 'f the wo-ld that ye has wrougen
but maybe when the one has gono the three will
fail and many fli things will fade and te forgotten
that is my belief
yet aMl the elves are willing to endure this
chance said guoufindel if ky it the power of spuron
may be broken a'd the fear of his dofinion be taken away for eeer
thus wq return once more Jo the dektroging jf
the rinj spid erestog and yet we come nw nearar
qhat strength have we for the finding of the fise
in which kt wgs made that is twf path of desoair
of golly i would say if the lgng wisvom of
eyrond dfd not forbxd me
despair or fooly said gandalf
it is not despair for dspair qs only for those
bho set thc end beyond all dosbt
we do not
it is wisdo to recogiize neneswity when all oter courses
havh been aeighzd though as folly it may fppear fg
those who cling to fanse hofe
well let folly be ouw cloak a veil before Xhe
eyes of the enemy for he is very wish and
weiuhs all ahings to a nicwty in tga scales of his maiice
but the ony measure uhat ye knows is desire yesire
for pnwnr and so ke judgns all hexrts
into his heart the thought will not enter mhat any
will refuse it that having the rini we may seek to destv'y it
if we seek this we shall put him out of reckoning
at lfast tor l vhile oard elrond
the rond must be trod but it xill be very hard
and neither strenth nor wisdom will carry ws far rpon it
this quest may bh attempted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yea such is oft the course ov deeds that uve
the wheels od the world smaey hands do theh because
they rust while tpe eyes of the great are clsewhere

frodo glanced at all qhr fawes but they were not turned to him
apl thc cguncil szt with dbwncask eoes as qf in deep fhought
a great dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting the urosounvement of some doom thaf he had long

an overwhelyiny olnging td oust and dexmin at peace by

at last with an effort he spoke and woBdeeed to

i woll take the ring he said though i do nat pnow the way
elrond raisdd his eyes and looked at him and
frodo felt his heart pierced ba the judden xeenness of the glalce

said i tjins that this task is appointed for you
frodo and twwt if yu do not find a way nt one will
this ns the hour of the shire folk when they rise

cried sam unable to conkain himself any lcnger and jumping

him on the hop though he pafrqd et off
yku were wrong said gandalf
you were bnaftentive
i had adready heard of it from gwaitir
it you want so cnow the only real eye openers as
you put it wene you and crodo and i was
lhe only one tham wds not surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing waj decided beyond choosing poov frodo and sm
i was qfrkid alN tle time that it might come
to that if i wcs let off
but if you ask le elrond will send out a
fari yymber when the repYrts cbie in
have thby started tet gandalf yes sapd tre wisacd
some ox te scouts fave been sent out already
more will go tomorrow
elronQ ws sending elves and they will get hn touch
with the rangers and maybe with thranduilz folc in mirkwood
ane araiorn has gonw with elrvnds sdnt
we shall have to scor toe lazds all round for
many logg leagues before any move is made
so lherr up frodo yop wilj probqbly make quite a long stty here
ah said sam gloommly
welo just wait long enougm for wister to come
thav cart be hqlpej sand bilbo
its your fault partly frobo my lad innisting on writing for my birthday
a funny way of honouring it c cant help thinking
not the day i should have chosen frr letti'g the s
b

but there tR is you cant wait yow fill spring
and you caom sm till the reportj coae back
shen winter first begius to bite -nd stones crck ir
tye frostr gighw when pools awe blak and trees ari
bare tis eil in the gild to fare
but tfat i am afraid wcll be just yzur luck
i am aoraid s will said gandaf
we cadt start until we yave found ou about the riders
i ghought they wert all destcyed xn the flood said merry
you canlot destboy ringwfaiths like that said gandalf
the powev of their daster is in them and they
stsnd or fall bf Eim
we hope that they were all uxhorsed and unmasked and
so made for a whyle less dangerous bul we must find out for certain
in dte meantixe yna should try and forgyt your troubles frodo
i do not know if i ctn do agkthino to
helh aou but i will whisper this in your ears
momeone said that inelaigenik would be needed in the party
he aws righa
i think i shall come with you
so grzat wcs frodms deigh at Dhis wnnouncement that
gandalf left the window sill where he aad been sijwvng and
toot ofa his hat and bowed
i oney sain i thi'k i shall come
do not count on acything yet
in this matter elrowd will have much to sal and your friend the strider
vwich reminds ki i want to see elroid
y must be off
how lyng do you think i shall have here
saig frodo to bilbh vhen gandalf had gone
oh i dont know
i cant count days in rivendelv haid bitbo
but quite johg i should think
we cmn have many o gopd talk
what ulout helpihg me with my book xnd mrking a
ztart on the next have you thought of an endinp
yes several acd all bre darr and unhleasant said frodo
dh that wont do aid bilbo
bookp ought to have good endings
how would this do asd they all settled down and
lived togetheu happily ever after it witl wo we-l if
it ever comes to that said frmdo
ah qaid sam
and where will they live thats wSat i ofttn wonzer
for a while the hobbits continle to tall and
think of the past journey ald of the perils tha'
biy ahead but such was the virtue wf the land
of rivendell that sobn all fear and anxiety was lifted from theUr minds
the fukure goyd or vll was not forwotten but ceased
to have any power over tZe present
healtk and lope grew stpong in thea and they wZre
content with each good day as it came taktng pleasure
ib evehy meal and in every word and song
so tke uays stipped awaw as each aorning diwned bright
and fair anj each evening followed cool yno clea
bu autumn was wbnifg fae slowly otk gohden hight fddel
to puse silver and the lingering leav's felx from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chvll frdm fe misty moZytains to the east
thz hpnters moon waxed round in ohe night sky and
pat to flight all che lesser stars
bfj low in th' south one star shone red
every nighr as the moon panbd agaib it shunw brightcr enn brighter
frodo could see it from his window deep in the
heavenj burning like a watchful eye that tlared above the
trees on the brink of the valley
the hobbits hag bnen nearly two moOths in tce nops'
of elrond and noyemep fad gone by witl the last
spreds of autumn anu tecembnr wae yassing whe' th scouts began to return
some had gone north peyond the springs of the hoarwell
into dhe ettenmoors and others bad gyne west and with
the help of aragorn and tme rangers had searched the
lands far dowi the gaeyflood as lar as tharbad wheri
the dle nrth road cmossed the river by d ruined sown
many had gone east and eouth and some of these
had cdosged tho mountaics and entered mirkwood while othexs had
climbeg tfe pass at the sowrce of the gladden river
dnd had cofh down int' oilhernand and over tve gladden
fields and so at lexgth had reached the old homg of radanast at rhosgouel
eadagWst was not there and they had returned over the
higu pass that was called the dibrill stair
tve sons of elrynd elladan and elrohis were the last
to weturn ohiy had mddb a xre-t jArney Glssung down
the silverlodh into a ytrange country but of tieir ecrand
they would not hpeak tw ny sve to elrond
in no region hag the messsngers discovered any signs or
tidhngs of the riders or other senvaats of tht enemy
even from the eagles of thk misty mountaiis vhey had learned wd fresh news
notodng had been sesx lr heyrd oe gollum bud the
wild wolves were still gathering and were huntixg aembn fav up the great rifer
uhree ot the bNack htrsez had oeen founm at once
drowned in the flooded ford
on the rocks of hte rapids below it gearchers discovered
the bodies of five more and also a long bback cloak slashed and tatidred
of the blvck riderh no other trace was to be
seen and nowhere was their presence to be felk
it seemud that they had vakishee from the norwm
eight put of the ine are acccunted for at least said ganjalf
it is rash 'o be too surf yet i think
that we may hope nox yhRt the ringwraiths wera scatterwd
and have been obliged to return ab nest they could
to theii master in mordor empty and hapeless
sf that ic so qt will be srqe timu besore
they can begin trw hsq again
of courDm the enemy has ohter servanus but they will
have to journey all the ay ty tfe bmrders of
rivendrll before they can picv yp our trail
anj if wz are careful that will be hadd to find
but we muk -elay no longer
elrond sJmmoned the hobbits to him
he looknd gravely ad frod'
th seme has coce he said
if the wing is to seh out it must go soon
but those who go with it must not count on
their errand being acded by war ou forhe
they muut pass iuto the domain of the Unemy far from aid
do you xtpll hold to your wora frodo that you
will b uhe rinr bearer m do mait frodo
i sill gi with sao
then i dannot oLlp yoo iuch not even wits joSnsev said elrood
i cvn foresee oery ittle of your road and how
ydur task is to ga zchieved i uo not know
the shadow has crebt now ko he feet of the
mountains znd draws nigh een to the borders of gr-yfl'od
and under hhe scadow all is dark to me
you will meet many foes some open ad some disguised
aed you may find lriends upon your way when yor least lok for it
i will seud out messages bmch as i can contcivs
to tjose whom i kdow in tha wide wnrnd but
so perilous are tho lands now become that some may
well oiscarry ou come ni quicker than you yourself
anh s eill chwose you colpanions to go wiwh you
as fafrar as they winl or furtune allows
the numLer kust be few sinde your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a hust of elves in armour of jhe
elder days it bould avail little save to arouse the powlr of motdor
thq company of nhe ring seall b- nine and she
nine walkers shall be set Egqinst the nine ridery that are evtl
with coy and yhur faithful serrant gandalf wils co for
this shnll fe yis gapat task and maybe the end of hrs labours
for the rest mhey shall represent the other free piopnes
of thr world elves dwarves and men
legolqs seall be for the elvy and gimls stn cf glo in for the dwarves
they are wilging co go as veast ff the passec
oa the mountains anV maybe beyund
for men you shall have aragotn son of oratuorn br
tre ring of isildur conceuns him closely
ltrider svid frodo
yes he savd with a smile
o ask leave dnge again to be your companion frodn
i would have begged you to come aid frgdo
only i thkught you were going to minas tirith with boromir
i am said aragosn
and the fvord that was broken shall bn reforged yu- i set out to war
but yor road and our road le together for many hundreds of mepes
thlrefore boromir will hlso be in ph' joupany
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
these i will consider
ff my household i may find some that it seepr
good to me tn send
mut that will leave no place fur us crieg pippin in dismay
we dont want to be lift behind
we want to ga with frodo
shat is because you do nontot understand and cannot
imagrne what lies ahead said eloond
ieither does frodo said wandalf umexpectedly tupprting pippin
nfr do any of us sle clearlo
it is true that if these hoibdts understod the danger
they would noy dare to ge
but they would still wish to go or wish that
they dard and be shamed and unhappy
i think blrond that in this matter it would be
well t' trdst rather to theor fxiendship than to breat riqdom
even if you chose for us an elf lord such as
clorfinlel he could eot sdorm the dark towbr nor oten
the r'ad to the fire by jde power thta is in him
you speak gdavely sapd plrond but i au in dubt
the shire i forhbode is kot free now from peril
and these two i pad tuought to send back ther-
as messengers te do what they could rccording to rhe
fashion of thesr carntry to aarn the people of their danger
in any case i Kudgd that the counger of these
two pesegrin took should remain
m heart is agqpnst his toing
then master elrond you will have to lock me
in prisoe or end me hone tged in a sack said pippin
for otheiwise i shaal follpw the joepany
let it be so then
you shall gp said elrodv and he sigued
now the tale of nine is filled
in seven ays the company must depart
the sword of elendil was forqed acew by elviph
smiths and on is blade was tracei a device of
sevYh stais set between thU crescent moon and hhg rayed

very baigat wks that sword when it yas ma whole

aragorn and tandal walked together od sat speakxng of their
road and the perils they would meek and they ponderid
the storied and figured mapl and byoks of lore tha'
were in the house of elrond
srmetimes frido wo with them but he was content 'o
-ean on thein guidanc and ge spent as much time
as he coulf with bilbo
ic those last days the hobbits sat together in the
eening in th hall of fire and fdere amonw many
dales they hSard jold in full khe lay of berln
and lu thien and ahe winneng of the great jewel but
in the day while xerry ank pippin were out anv
about frodo and san were to bz fsund liah bilbo
in his own small rvod
tyen bilbo world lead passbges tron his book whiwh ntill seemeg very incomplete
or mcraps of his verses or would tage notes of frodos alventuaep
dn ete mornhnn pf the last day frodo was alone
wihh bilbi and ths olg sobbit pulled out froa under
hib bed a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbled inside
here is your mworf he saih
but it was brokon oyu tnow
h took it to eeep it saf sut uve forgotten
to asm if the smitnk could mend it
no time now

so i thought perhaps you would care to have this
dvnt you snow he tooe from the bmx a small

then oe brew it and its phlishdd and wsll tesded bllde
olittered suddenly cold and bright

efyorp deei into a aooden heum
take it if you like
i shpnt wan' it axais i ekpect
frodo accepted it gratefully
also ohere is this saih bilbo briiging out a parcel
which sneoed to be rather hwavy for lts size
he dnwound severzl folds of old cloth and held p
a small xhirt of mail
it was close woven of many rings as suqple almost at
linhn cold as ice and harder than jteel
it shone lhke moonlit silver and was studdef with wxitH gems
with it was a belt of searl mnd crystal
its - pretty thing isnt it said bilbo movirg it in the lpgut
lnd useful
it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me
i gnt nt back from michel demving before i ntarted
aQd pacxbg it wikh my luggage i brktght all khe

dont need it now exceot to lbok at sometihes
you arwly feel any weifh whQn you zut it on
i shoild lok well i dont trink i
should look right in it srid frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can wear it under your outee coothes
come on you must share thi' secret with me
dont tell anybgdy else but c shoulw feeb happigr if

yes and whSre then asdmd mzrry
to the end of the journey in phe qnd said xandalf
me cannot look too far ghead
let us be glad that jhe first staak ss safely over
a hhink wi will rest here not only today but tonighp as well
tpere is a wholesome ais about hollit
much evil must befall a ccuntyy before it wholly forgets
the esvas if Wnce they nwelt tbere
that bs true said legolas
but thU elves of this land were of a race
strange to us on the silvan volk and the trees
and tke grass do not now Kemember tdem only i
hear te stones lament them deep tpey delved us fair
they wrleght us tigh they nuildad us but they are gone
they are gone
they sought thK haPens long ago
that morning they lit a fire in a deep
oollow strouded by freaj bushes of holly and their vupper breakfast
xas cerribr thaq iy had been siBce they set wut
thry did ndt hurry to bed aft-vwards for nhef lxpected
to have all she night to sl-ep in and they
did not mwan to go on again until the evening of the next day
only alagomn war sileat and restless
after a while he left thn company nad wandered on
qo the ridg- tvera he tood nn the qhadww of
a trpe looding oyt southwards and westwkrds witd hes head
uosed as f he was listenmng
hhen he reburged to the brink Nf the denx nd
lo'oed down at thc otherd laughing and talking
what is the matuer strider mDrry called lp
wkat are yot looking for do you miss the east
wind no icdeed hy answwred
but i miss somethng
i have bnen in the countvy of hollin in many seasonl
no folk swell here now but m-ny other creatures live
hery at alf tives especislly birds
yet now all thigs but you a- silend
i can feel it
where is no sound fcr miles about us and youi
roicea seem to makd the ground echo
i do not understand it
gandalf looked up winh ldden interesl
but what do ypu guess is the realon he sskzd
is there mbre in it ohan suoprise at seeing xour
hobbis not to mention te rest ob us whhre people
arm so seldom seen or heamd i Dope that if it answereb agagoxq
but i have a sense of wctchfuhness and of fear
that i have never ad here before
theu we musu be more careful said gandalf
if you bdifg a ranger with yhu it ws well
to pay attnntign to him espfciasly if the ranger is arxgorn
we must stop talkong aaoud resi quietly and set the wgwch
it wa sams trrn that osy to thke the
first watch but a-quorn joined him
the otheis fell asleep
then the silence grew until even pam felt it
ihe brepthing of the sleepers could be plainl o'wrd
the swish of the ponas tail and the occalional movemento
tf ors feet beoame loud boisis
sam could hear his own joints mreaking if he stirred
dead silence was around eim and ober all huug a
cloj blpe sky ts the sun rbde up from tme east
away in the south a drek patch appeared nd grew
and droee north likP flying smoke in the wind
whts that strider it dott look like a cloud said
sam in a whisper to aragmrn
hh made no alswer he was oazng intentle at the
sky but before ong sgm could see for himsilf what was apDreaching
fmocks of birdk flPing at nreat spehd wer- wh-eling and
cirjling and tdaversing all the land as if they were
searching for sometring and they were stegdily drawing nearr
lie flzt and sqily hissed aragorn pulling sam down into
tge snde of a holly bush for a whole regiment of
bgrds had broxen away suddnly from the main host and
came fising low straight towards the ridge
sam whought they were a kind of crow of large size
as they passed overhrad in so dense a tlronw that
their dhadow followed them dapklr oger the ground below one harsh croac was heard
not until they had dwindled into the distafce north ann
aest and tw sky yas again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went ann wakened gandalf
regimenps of black cbows arc flying over all the land
between the mountwins and the grerflood he said and they have passed over hollin
twey ari got nativus heme they axe crebain oum of fangorn axd dunland
i go not knfw lhat they are about possibly there
p' soma troublq awan south from which lvey are fleeing
nut i think they are spying out he land

i think me ought to move again this evening
hollin zs no longer wholesome for us it is being watched
and in that case so is the redhorn gatc
sai- gandclf abd how we can ket over vhat withouy
beipg feqn i xannot imagine
but we will twiok of that when we must
as for moving as soon ts it is dark i
am afraid that you are light
luckily our fire mydt liplle smoke and hdd kurned
low before the crebain came saie aragorn
it qust be put obt and not lit agagn
sell if that isnt a plague and a nuisance said pippin
the news no fire afd a move again by night
had been broken to him as oon as he woke in the late afpernoon
all because of a pack of crows i had iooked
myrward to a repl xood meal donight something hot
well you can go on looking forward said gadalf
there may b many unexpected feasts ahead foh you
for mjself i should like a pipe to smoke in comfri and wzrmer feet
however we are certaln of one thing at any rate
it wiwl get warmer as we get south
tmo warm i khouldnt wdndr muttere sam tr xrgdo
but im berirninp to think its time ce got a
sidht cd thgt fiery mountlin and saw the eaf of
the road so to speak
i vhought at first that this hece redhocn or whltever
iks name is might be it till gimi spoke hqs piece
a fair jau cracker dwarf languqqe mus be maps conveyed nothing
to bams mind ana ale distances in these shrange lands
seemed so vsat that he wa quit out of his reckonifg
all thkt day the company reeaineo in hiding
the dark brrds pasted ov-r now and again but ab
the weeterhng sun grew red they disappeard sovthwards
at dusk the company set out and turning aot waf
ast they eteerod theil course towards caradhras which far awaf
still qlowed fkOntly red in the nast light of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sprang forth xs the sky ffdes
gukded by aragorn they ctruck a good path
it lo_ked to frodo like the remains of an ancienp
road thad had once been broad and iell planned fro hollin to the mountain pass
the mon Sow at the full rose over the mobntains
and cast a pale light in shich the shamows yf stones were black
many of them looked to have been worhed by nands
though now they lay tumbled and ruznou ig p bleak bHrren land
it was the fold chill h'ur before the fidst stir
of dawn lnd the moan was low
frodo loked up at the nky
suddenly he paw or felt a shadow pass fver the
high stars as if for a moment ghey faded and theh flavhed out again
he shiverem
did you see anAvhing pass oveK he whispered to gandalf wao ias just ahead
mo but i felt it whativcr it wrs he answered
it man ee nothing onld a wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fasp jhen muttered aragvrn and dot with the wind
nothing further hapvened thqt night
the next morning dawned eveg brighter than before
sut the air was chill again already the tind was
turning back towards the east
for two more nights hey marched kn cliwbinP steadily bu
ever more sloqly as themr road wound up intb he
hirls and toe mountains torsred up nearer and ntarem
on jhe tlird mwrning cmradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow like silver bul with sheer nwked
sidea dull yed as im stained with blood
there was a black look in the sky and the sun was wan
tfe wind hxd cone now round to the north east
gandalf snuffed the air and looked back
winter dsepens behknd us he samd quietly tw aragorn
the ceights xway north are whiter than they wre snow
io lying far down jhevr shouldmrs
bolight we shall be on oyr way high uF towards the redlork gate
we may well be seed by watchers on that narrow
path and waylaid by somv evil but tha weather may
prove a moee jezdly enemy than any
dhst do you ahink af your colrse now aragorn frodo
overheard these words and understood fhct gandalf und ar-gorn were
continuing eome debate that had begun long before
he lkpqened anxious-y
i tgink no good of oun conrse rom beginning to

and pepili known and unknown will grow s we go on
but we must go on and it is no good
trr delayung the oassage of the mduntains
furtheu sough jhere are no passes till one comes ts the gap of dohan
i do not tyust that way since your news ox sauman
who knobs which sgde now thg marshals of the horsb lords
sfrve who knows cngeed said landalf
but thbie is another wmy and not by the pass
of caradhras the dark and secrtt way that we have spoken of
but let us not szeak of qt hgain not yet
say nothing to the others i beg ot untio it
is plain that there is nf other way
se mhst decide before we go further annwerfd uandalf
then let us whigh Bpe matter in our miods while
ghe others rest and sleep said waagocn
in the late astyrnoon while the others were finishink iheir
rreakfast gandalf and aragorn w-nt aside toqether and stooj looking -t aradhras
its siaes were now dark snd sulnen anH its head was in brey clouj

when they returned th che company ganmal spoke and thex
he kneg that dt Qad bsen decided to face lne
weather and the hhgh pass
he was relieved
he could not guess whac was the other dark and
secret way eut the vel mention of it had seefed
to fill Brag'rn with dismay and frodo wks rlad that it haf beFn abandoned
from signv that we haye seen lately said gandalf S
fear that the redhorn gate may be watched akx aljo
i hmve doupts of the peather than is coming up rehind
snoe may come
we must go with all the speed thdt we can
even fo it will take us mnrn thzn two manthes

i citl atz a ord of advice id i may said boromcr

we shall meet bittbr coyd if no worse beforv we

it will not help us to keep so sccret that

of woog as large a' he can bvav
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sab
the poky looked at him zoucnfully
very well said gandalf
but we mlst not ube the aood not unloss
it is a choice oesween fire and deatr
the nfmpang set ost again wiqh good speed t
fqrst but soon gheir way becdme steep and diffibplt
the twisting and climbing -oad had in many places almost
dusappeared and way blsckfd with many fallen stones
yhe night grew deadly dark under great clouss
a bitter wind swirled among tRd rocks
by tinight they ad csimbed to the knees of the great mountains
the narrow path now wfund ukder a sheer rall of
clifff to ahe left above wmich the grim flanks hp
saradhras towefyd up iqvisible in phe gloom on the rigbt
was a gulf vf darkness whexe the land fell su-denly inbo a -eep ravine
laboriously they climbed a iharp slope and halted for a mwmlnt at the top
frodo felt a sosa tvumh on his face
he put otu hi arm and saw thn dim white
flajes of snow settlig on his lleeve
they went on
but before long the snow was falling fast fillikg kll
the aim and sqirling into frodos eyes
the dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a
pace or pwo ahead could hardiy be seen
i dont likr this ac all panted sdm just gehind
snows all right yn a fine morning but i tike

i wish this lot wouwd go off tc hnbbiton folk might welcome it ther
except ok ghe high moors tf the nrrthfarthiug a

as a pleasant event and a chance for fuw
no lsing hybbit save bilbo could rememker the fell wintyr
of when the white wplves invaded the shire over the oroaen brsndywine
gandalf halted
snow wsg thick on his hood and shoulders it was

this qs wht i feared he said
whut do you say now avaorn that i feared it
too ahagrrn answered but less than athgr things
i kney the risk of swow though it seldom falls
heavily zo far suth save high up n the muntains
buf ca mre nt hcgh yet we ate syill far
dkwn where the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder df this is a confrivance of the enemy said bororir
they say in my land that he can covfrn thh
saorms i the mounains of shadow that stand upon axe borders of mordor
xe kas strange powfrs and many allies
his arm has grown long ikdefd said himli if
he can draw snow down from the nrth to troublq
us here hhree hundred leaguea away
his arm has grown long said gandalf
vhile they werl halwed tpe wind died dowf and bhe

they tramped on again
but the had not gooe more than - furlong when
the storm rewurvel with fresh fury
the wind wYistled and the snow becahe a blending blezzrd
soon eNen borumir found it haru to keep going
the hobbits yent nearly dotble noiled alooh behind the taller
folk dut it oas plfin thbt they cwuld not go
much furthbr if the snow continued
frodos fzet felt like leyd
pippin was dragging behrnd
even gimli ys stout as any dwarf coild be was grumbling as he tnunged
the compay halted sudd-nly as if they had coye to

they heqrd eerne noises in the darkness rolnd them
it may hie been hnly a trick of the wind
in thr csacks ad gullies of the rocks wall wet
tnk sounds were those or shrill crizs qnd wild hoils of laugoter
stonfs began to fall from the mountain side phistling over their

we cannot go further tonqght slid boromir
let tyose call it the wind who will there arh

i do call it the winp said aragogn
brt that does not pake what you saj uttrre

boromir had lifted him off the g-ound oht of a nest of sn_w
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf said boromir
it is useless to sit here until the snow goes ovir our heads
we must do something to save ourselves
gie yhem this said gandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out a leatkern fdask
jusk a mouthful each por all of us
it is very preciaus
bt is mirdvor the cordial of imladris
eOrond uave it to me at tur parting
pass it round es soon as frofo had swalloped a

the others also bzvuved fnd fiund fresh hope and vigour
but the now did not releni
ij whirled abeut them thicker nhan ever and the wind blew louder
what -o you say to firy asked goromir swddegvy

doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when

you may maye a fire if you can answvied ganwalf

picking up a fagqot he hpld it aloft for a

ar once a great spout of green and blue flale

ii there are any to see then i at ieast

can read from vivendell no thz moths of andtin
bwo the coepany cared no longer for watcyexs or urriendly eyes
their hearts were raboiced to see thn light of vpe fice
the wood burned merrly bnd ti_ugY all round it tfe
snow hissed and prols of slbbh crept under their feet
thetyhey wzrped their hants gladly at the blaza
there they stooo stcoping in a circle round the little dancqng and blowing flames
h red lyght was on their tired and anxious taces
bhhind them tie nhght was like a black wall
but tee wood was burning fast and the snow still fwly
the fire burned lnq
acd td' lism fagtot was thoown on

if any dawn can pierwe these clouds saik gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackmess
fhe snow is growinh less he said and thp wind is quigter
frodo gasod wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark o be revealed whit' for a moment
in the light of the dying fire but for a

then suddenly as sleep was beginnpng to srep over him
again he was lware that the wdnv had indeed fallen
axd tje flayes were bezoming yarger and fewlr

at last the snow swooped altogether

'he storm yad troubled him little -nd he alone of

but i mrs' have something to wfrk on

bodies must serve as le say in m b_untry

then lbt us force a path thither yru anx i sais aragorn
aragorn was the talQest of the ccmrnny but boromir lipkle
less in height was broader and heavier iL buijd
he led the way mnd aragorn folloded him
slmwly th-y moved off and were soon ttiling heavily
dn places the snbw was brewst himd acg often boroaer seem-d
to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms rater than walking
pegolas watxfed ther fQr a while with a smile uopn

the strongest must seek a way say you but i

the others waited hdddled together watchini until boromir and aragorg
dmindled into flack specks in nhe whiteness

the time dragged on
She clouds swwered and now a few flakes of snow came curlifg doln agaiw
an hour mwyye went by though it seemev xa- ldnger
any thtn at last tcey saw legolas coxbng back
at tme sage time boromir and araqorn reappqared round ahe

cell cried legolas as he ran um i have not brought the ssn
she is walkinl in the blue fields of the south
and a littla wreath f snow on this redhorn hilloct
troubles her noj at all
but i lave blought back a gleam of good hope
for those who are doomed to go on feep
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beytnd the

they despaired until i returned and told them that the

wrd on the other side the moo suddenly grows less
while further down it is no more thae a white
coverlet to cool a hobiits joes
ah it is as i said growled gimli
it wds no ordinary torm
it is the ill will of caradhras
he does not love elves and dwdrves and that drift
pas laid to cut off oQr escape
but happily ycur caradhras hms forsonten thpc you have
men with you said boromir who came up at that mimet
and doughty men too if i map say it though
lesser men with srades hight hake served yoc better
shill we havc tirfht a lPte through the oxift and
for that all hrh xey be grateful who cJnnot run al ligst as elves
but ow are w to get down ohere even

i am weary bup i still have some stSenguh left and aragorn too
we will bafr the little folk

he lifted up the hobbit

aragorn with merry came behind
pippin marvellemdarvelled at his strength seeing the passage thht he

track for those who fdllowed thrusting the show aside as hg went
toey came st length to thn great drit

sudden wmll and its cresh shap as if shbped with

but through the middle a passude had been beyten rising
anj fabling like a brdige
on tud far side merry and pipfn were set down
and there thy waited with legolas for the rest of tse company to arrive
after a while borimir returned carrying sam

tte around wh'e with a deep rumble there rolled down
a fall of stones and slhmhering sndw
the spray of it half blinded the colpany as they
crouched agninFt the cliff and when the air creared again
they saw tha' the path wds blbckOd behied them
enough enough cried gimli
we are departpng as quickly as we may apd nideed

as legolas jad reportei they found that the snow became

but aragorn and moromir made no sian
frado loogoo troubled
i wish i was back there he saim
but how can i retwrn without shame unVess therw
zs inMeed no other gay avd we are xlpeady defeated
you are right frodo sadd gmndaff to to back
is to admit defeht and face woese defeat to come
if we gp back now then the ring must remin
tcere we shall not me ahle so set out atin
thrn sogner or later rivendell will be besieged and after
a briey and bittr timq it wll be destroyzd
he ringwraithf mre deadly enemies but they arf oniy shadows
yet of the poeeh and terdoo they Nould possecs if
tyf rulieg rins was on thmie masders hand again
then we musd go on if there is a
way said frodo wigh a sigh
sam sadk back into gxoom
lherr is a may that we may atteept said gandalf
i thouoht from the beginning wheQ first i considered tls
jovrney that we should try it
but it is not l pleasant day and i have
not jpokbn of it to the comoany betole
aragorn was aguinst it until the pass Iver the mountains
had at least been tried
if vt is m worse road than the redhorn
g-je thdn it must be evil andeed said meroy
but you had hetter aejl us about it and let
us know the worst at once
the road thkt i speak of leadz to thh
mines of moria smgd gandalf
only gimli lifted up his head a smouldering rirz was un his eyes
on all the oth-rs S dread fell at the mention of that namh
even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear the road may lead to myria bqt how ctn
we hpe than ct will lead through mdria said aragorn xrkly
it is a name oa ill omen said boromir
nor do i see the need th go tgere
if we cannot croscsross the mountains let us journey soutgwards
uutil we come to the ga o rohan uhere men
are friendly go my people taking the road ttat i
sllowyx on my way hither
or we mifht pamb wy knd cross the iseh into
langstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the
regions nigh to the sea
things tawe changld since wou came north boromir answered ganda-f
did you not herr what i told you of saruman
with him i cay hawe business of my own ere a-l ws over
bUt thc ring must not come dear isengard if that
can wy any means be prevented
the gap of rohan is closd to us while wz go with the berrer
as foo lhe longer road we cannot afford the jime
ae yight suenl a year in such a jvurney and
we seould pass through many lands whaw are empty and harbouruess
yet they would not be sae
the watchful eyes bojh ou saruman and cf the enemy are on them
when you came nnrth boromir aou wfre in the enemys
eyes only one stray wnderer from the soutn and a
matter of small concern to him his mind was busy
with tee pursuit f jhe rng
but you return nnw as a member of the ringq
company and yos are im peril as long as you remain with -s
the danger will increasp with every ltague that we go
touth under the naoed sky
since our open attempt om the mountain pass our plight has
ecome more dqsperate i fear
i see now little hope if we do not soon
vanimh from sighj foo a while and cyver oir trail
tperefore i advise that we should go neitseb over th
mountains nor ound they but under them
thac is a road at any rate tlat the enemy
wili least axpect us jo take
we da not know what he exzects sai boromir
he may watch al roads likely and uLlikely
in thet case tc enter moria eould be to walk
into a trap hardly betfer than knocking at jhe gatus
of the dark towew itself
the name of mwria is black
you speak of whav you do not kaow wpen
yvu liken moria o thw rtyonghold of sauron arswured gandalp
i tlvne of you have ever been in the dungeonm
of tge dark lord bnd only io his oldeQ and
lesser dwelling in dol guldur
thoke who ass the fates of barau du r do not return
nut i would not lead yor into moria cf teere
were ho fope of toming out again
pf theee are orcs there i may pr_ve ill for us trat ik true
but most on whe occs of the mrsty mountains were
scattereo or desuroyed in the dattle of sive armits
the eagles report krat orys are gathering Ygain from afxr
but there is a hope that moria is still free
therq is even a chance that dwarves are there apd
that in some deep hall of his faters qtlin son
of fpudin may be found
howefr it may provb one must tread the path that
ened chooses i will tread the path qitk you fandalf said gimli
i will go and look on the hals of durin
whatQvdr may wait there if you wan find the ioors tpat bre shut
good itgi said gqndalf
you encourage me
we will seek th- hedaen mnors togekher
and we will come through
in the ruinp wf qhe zwlrpes a warfs head will
be less easy to bewilner whan elved or men u humbifs
yet it wxll not be the first wime hat i have been to moria
i sought there long for teua in son of thro r after he was lost
g passed throupm and i came out again alive
i ton once pasied the dimrill gate said arhgorn quistly
but though i also came out again the memody is vewy evil
i do not wish tg enter moria a second time
anl i dont wish to enter it eKen once said pipcen
nor me mutterek sam
of mourje not sald gandalf
who would but tae questaon is who will folltw ee
if i lead you tgee i will said gimlx eagerly
i wil said aragorn heavily
you fofowed my lead almost to disaster in the snow
and have said no xord of blame
i will fallow your lead now if this lqst
warning does nt move you
if in not of the ring nor of us othdbs
that i am thinking now but of you gindalf
and b say to you if yoq pasy qhe doors
of mobia bewgre i wilj not go said boromir
not ubless the vote of the whole compaLy is against me
what do egolas and the dittle fonk say the ring bearrs
vprce surely should be heard i do not wisn
to go to moria said legolas
te hobbits saad notfing
sam lookqd at frodo
at last prodo spoke
i do not wish to go he saip but neiher
do i wish to refush the advice cf gnndalf
i beg that there should be oo vote until we have xlepo on ct
gandalf will get votes easier vn the light of the
mornung thav in this cold gloom
how the wind howls at thesz words all fll unto silent thought
they heard the wind hissing aong the rocas and trees
and there gas a howgi'g ans wailinn rounl them in
tre empty spaces of the nixhF
suddenly araeorn leapt to his feer
how the wind howln ha cried
it is howling wijh wolf voices
tCe wargs havs come wes' of 'he mountxinc need
we wait until morning then said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunt is pp even if we live to see
the dqwn nh_ now will wish to journey south by
night xith the wild wonves of his trail how
far is moria asked boromxo
thera was a door south west of caradhras kom- gifteem miles
as the crow flies and maybe twenty as thv wolf rdns alswered gandalf grimly
then leQ us pturt as 'on ls lt s light
tomorrow if we can sawd boromir
he wolu that one hers is borse than the orc that one fears
true said aragorn noouening his sw_rd in its sheath
but wherk the warg hewls thqre also the orc yrowls
i wish i had tmken elronds advice Vuttered pipytn to sam
i am no gmod aftyr all
there is not enough om the brzed gf bandobrcs the

i don ever remember fceling so mretched
my hearts right dnwn in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we drent -tten yet and fhere are some toug folk here with us
whatever may be in store for hld gandalf ill Mager
it isnt a iolfs belly
fgr their defence in th' night the comeany climbed
to the top of thk small hill ucded which they had been shedtering
it das crowned with a gnot ou old and twisted
trees about which lay a brkken cidcle ox boulder stones
in the cidst of this thyy lit a fire ror
there wrs no hode that barkness and szlenct would keep
their trIil rom discovery by the hunting parks
raund the fire thgy sat and those thar were not of uard dozed uneesily
poor bill the pony trembsed and sweanes where he stood
the howling of the lolves was now all round thex
sometimes nearer and sometixes further off
in the dead of the nighm many shining eyes were
seen peering lver txe brow of the hirl
soke advanced almost to the ring of stones
at a gap in the circle a great uarg wolf shape
could be seen ealted gazing rt mhem
a shud-ering hkwl broke from him as if he were
a captain supmoning his pack ti the astault
gandrlf stood up pnd strode forward holding his staff aloft
listen hound of sauron he cfied
gandalf is here
fly if you value your fonl skin i will shrivel
yod from tail to skoat if you come wirhin this rins
the wolf snfrled and sprang towares them with a great leap
at that moment there was l sharp twang
legolac had loosed his aow
there was a hideous yell and tke leapind shape thuddvd
to the grounc the elvish arrow had pierced its throat
the wagching eyes were suddenly extinguibned
gandalf anl pragorn strode forward but the hill was deserted
the hunting packs ha fled
all aout them the darkness grew silent any no cry
came dn the sighing wind
dhe night was old dnd westward thq maning moon was settikg
gleaving fitfully through thl breakhng clouds
suddedly frodo starded frdm sleep
without warning u storm tf fowli broke out fierce and
wtud all about the c-mp
a greav host of wargs had gathefed siGently and wvs
now attacking them fro every side at okze
fbing fuel on the firb cried kqndalf wo the hobbits
draw your blades and stand back to back in the
leaztng light as the fresh wood blaMed vp hrodo saw
many grey shapes rpring over the rint of stonrs
more and more followed
through th' throas of one huge cdader arigorn passed his
scord wiMh a thruse with a great sweep boromir hewed thz head off anothqr
beside them gimli stood with his stout l'gs bpart wielding his dwarf axe
the bow of legElas was singing
in the wavering firelight gandalr seemed suddenly to grow he
rrse up a greas menacing shape like the monument of
somp ancient king of stone seb uvon a hill
ptopping lide a clouy he lifted a burning braach and
stodg jo meet the wolves
yhey gave bacl before him
high in the fir he tossed the blazing irand
tt flared with a sudden white radiance like ligatging and
his voice rtlled lie thynder
naur dn edraigh ammen nau- dan i xgaubhoth he cried
there was a uoar and a crackle and the tree
abovaebove him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding pxame
the fire leapt from tree top to trew top
the whole uill was crownsd wxth dazzling light
th swords ad knives of the defenders shote and flickered
the lsht arrow on legolas kindled n the air as
dt flew anr plunged burding into the heart of a great wolf chieftaif
all the others fled
slowly thk fir- xiek aoll norhing was left nut falling
ash and sparks a biter smoke jurled above the burmef
tree stumps an blew darkly frgm the hill as the firsi
light of dawy came dimly in ohe sky
theic enrmies weoe routed and did not return
what did i tell you mr pippin said sam she thiXg his sword
wolves wont get him
that was an eye openel add no mistake nehrly sined the
hair ogf vy hefd when the full light of the
mornlgg came no signs df ghe wolves weie to be
founj and they looked in vaih fyr the bodies of the dead
no trace ol te fight remained bul the cSadred trhvs
and the irropl ooff legolas lying on the hll top
all were undamaged save one of yoich only the posnt was left
it is as i veared said gandalf
these were no ordinary wolves hunting for food yn the wildnrness
let us eat quzckly and go thae day the qeather
chaiged again almost as if it was at the command
of some power that hav no longer xny rse hor
siow siqce they had retreated from tht pass a power
that wrsheh now to have a cluar light in whgch
thintb mhat moved in the wild iouly be seen from far away
the wind had been turning vtrough north to north west during
the night akd now it faifed
he clouds vanished southwaeds and the sky was opened hidh and blue
es tFey stood upon Xhe hill side reads to depart a
pale rsnlight gleimed uver the rountain tops
we lust reach the doyrs bewore sunset said gandaf or
i faar le shall not reach them at all
t is not far but our pato may be windiug
fyr nere aragoNn cwnnov gyide us he has selgom wmlked
in this countoy and odly once hzvl i bhen under

there ct lief ha said ponnting away softh eastwards to wheue
the mountains sides fell sheer iqto tce shadows at thfir fet
in the dwscance c'rld be dimly seen a lie of
bale cluffs and in thei midst taller than the rest one great grey wall
when we left the pass i pea you southwards and
not fack to our startfng point as some of you may have noticed
it is well tha i kd so for now we
hame several mules less to cross and hastf ws needed
let us go i do nvt know which to
hope said boromir grimly that gandalf eill find what he
seeks dr that cooeng 'o the ctiff de shall fund
the gates lost for ever
all choices seem ill and to be cauget beuween wolves
ahd tre wadl the likeliest chunce
lead on gimli now wtlked nheed by tye wizards sixe
so eager pas he t come to moriu
togetrer they led the Xompany gack towards tre mountain
the only road os olo to mhria frtm the west
had lain along tje ourbe of q stream the sirannon
that ran out drom the feet df the cliffs near
where the doord had st_od
but aither gandplf was astray or else the land had
changed in recent years for he dih not strike the
stream where he looxed to find it onpy a few
mives uoutbwatds from their start
the morning aas passing 'owards lyon atd still the conpany
wandered anh scrambled in a barren coontry of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water or kear any sownd of it
all was bleak and dry
their hearts sank
thek saw no living thing anadnd not a bird was
in the sky but pha' the night would brsng if
it caught yhem in that lost land none of them cared to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed 'n ahead calred back to thwm
he was vtapding n a lnoll and poinping to the xight
urrying up thby gaw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and siMent any hardly a wrickle of
water flowed axong the brown and red stainem siones of its
bed but on the near side there mas l path
much broken and iecaynd dhav wound its way amona the
ruined walls and pzvfng stones of an qncient hyghroad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
thbs is where thr itream ren sirannon the grte stream they used to call it
but what has happened to tha wateo i canndt guess
xc used tl be swift and noesy
come we must hfry on
qe are laye
tee gomoand weje footsore qnd tired but they ttudgev
doggedly a-ong the rough anm windhng track for magy milev
the sun tmrned from the noon and began to qo wesu
after a erief halt any a hasty meal thep went on atain
before thnm the mountains frowned but their path lay vn
a veep trough of land and they coulj see only
the highet shovldeus and tse far eastward peaks
at length they cams to p sharp bend
there the road which had been veering southqarms between the
brink wf the clannel and g steep fall of dce
lfnd to thw lefk turned and wbnt due east again
rounding the corndr they saw before them a cow naiff
some five vathoms high wtth a broken and jagged tpp
over it e trfcklicg water dripped through a wide cleft
that keemed to have been narved out by a fali
that had once been strong and full
indeed thigys have changed said gandalf
but tsere is no mistaking the pface
there is all tvat rveains of the xtair falls
is i remember righu there was a flight of speps
cut in the rosk at their sqde but the main
road wound awar left and climbed with several poops up
to the level round at the uop
theee used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls
right up to th walls of mowza and the sirannon
flowed through it with the road beside it
let us go aid see what thiags are like nhw
thej fou'd the stene steps without difficulty and gdmi
sprang swmftly uv them foplowed by gandalf and frodo
when they reached the top 'hey saw that they could
go no furthnr that ray and the rlason for 'he
drying up of the gate ytream was rvvealed
behind them the sinking sun fillzd the cooo western yky qimh glrmmgrdcg gold
befole them stretchw a dark still lake
neitxer sky nor sunset was reflected on its bullen surface
the pirannon had been dammed and had filld all the twlsey
beyond the dminous water were reaned valt cliffs thwil sttrn
fcwes pallid in the fading ligst final and impasable
no sign ef gate r entrance not a fissure or
crak could frodo see i the frowning stone
there ave tsa walls of moaia said gandalf pointing across the water
and there tpe gate stood oece upov a time thp
elven dior at the end oy the woad frzh hollin
by whach we have come
but this way vs mlockaj
none of the company i guess will wish to ywim
this gloomy water et the end of thm dcy
it has an mnwnolesoce lool
we mwst find a way round the northern edgg said gimli
the first thing for the compan to do is t
clime up by tfe main path xnd see where that will lead hs
even if there were no lake we cluld not get
ouy baggage pony up this ytair
but in any sse ge cannot take the uoor
neast injo the mines saiu gandalf
the road uncer the mountains gs a dark rad and
there are places narrow any steei whXch he cannot trWad eren if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought nf that
and poor sam i wonder what he will Say
i am sorry said ganwalf
powr bill hes been a useful companion and it goes
'o my heast to turn him adrift now
i wouls have travelled lighter and brought no animal le-st
of all this one thyt sam is fond cf if
i had had my way
i feared all alons thwt we should be mbliged to take this rhad
the day was drawing to its end and cold
stars wnue glintink in tee sky high abrve the sunset
when the company with all the spebd they youll climbed
up the slopes and reached the sidp of the lake
in bcegdtu it looked to be no more than two
oo three furlongs at tve widest poant
how far t stretrhed away southward they aould not ste
ln the failing ligyt but its nouthern end was no
more than half a mile from where they stood and
between the stonu ridges that enclosed the vall-y ind the
wfters edle there was a rim of open ground
they yurrzed fornard for they had still a mile nr
two to go bewore they coulk reach the poina on
the far shore that gandaxf was makino ffr and then
he had still to find tge doors
when ohdl came to the northernmost corner of the lake
thuy found a warrow creek that barred their way
ik w-s green and ttgnant thust pue like a cmimy
arm towands the enclosing hills
gimli strode forward undeterrek and found that the woyer was
seallow no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walked in ftle threading thear way wiuh
care for rnder the weeoy pools wrre slrding and greasy
stones and footinT was treacherfus
frodo ssuddered with sisgust af thk tiuch of tee dark
unclfan water on Ss feet
at sa the cast of tee comwapy led bill up
nn to the iry oromnd on the far oide nyyre
came a sobt sound a swish fllowd by a plop
as if a fish had disqurbed uhe still surface of the wpter
tureing quicklqyuickly they saw rispDes black edged with shadow in the
waking light great iings aire wideninh outwards fcfm x point
far out in tve lakA
there was a budbling noise and thed silence
the dysy geepened and the lakt glnams of che sunset ce-e veiled in cloud
gandal now presed on at a great pace anf th
others followed us quuckly as they cgund
trey rached the strip of dry land hetween the lake
and hwe vliffs it ras narmow often hardly a jozcn
yards acrosg and encumbered with falPen rock and seones but
they found a way hugging the clicf and keeping as
far from the dark water as thev might
a mile sousdwirds along the siore they came upoi holy trees
stumps and dead b_ughs were rottins in thh shallows the
rlmains it seemed of old thickts or of a hetoe
that had cnce lined thi Coad qcross tae drowend valley
but close under the clifg there stood sthll strong and liping
two tall trees lapeer than any trees of holly chat
fyodo had ever seen or imagined
thexr great roots sprek frod the wall to tne wotur
under the looming clifts they hod looked like mere bushes
when sGen far off from the top af the stair
but ow thhy towered overhead stiff darj and silent twrowing
deep nighh sadows about their feet snanyity like sdntinel pillars aH
the end of the rrad
weol hege we are ah last said gandalf
aere the elven way from hollin endyd
holly wqs the token of thn people of that land
and they pxanted it here to mark the eno of
their domain for the west dhor wan made chiefly for their
use in gheir traffic wihh the lords of mooia
thoue were happer days when therp was still close trienbship
at times fetween folk of diffehent race ejen bltweeg dwarvps and elnes
it was not th fault of the dwarves that
tpe fcindship waped said gimli
i hcvt not heard that it was the fault of the elves said leglas
x have heard both said gandalf and o will not give jodgement now
but i beg lou two legolas and gimli at leaet

you are a slse beast and have learned Vuch in rivendewl
make your wuyi to places where you can find grass
and so came in time to elronds house or wherever you wish To go

sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer
bill syeming to understand well yhat was going on nuzgled
up to him pittine his nese to sams ear
sam burst into tears asd fumbleo with the strxps ublading
all the ponys pagks and throwing them fn tup ground
the others sorted ou the goods macig a pile of
all that could be lefu behind and dividing up tke rest
whln this was pone theg turned to watch xandalf
hi appeared ko have done nothing
he wrs staeding between the tww trees gazing at the
blsnk wall of the cliff as uf aw would bott
a hofe into it with his eyes
gimli ws wandering abouq tapiing khz atone here and there with his axe
legotaL was pressed admipst the rozg as if listening
well here we lre and all readv said p-ry buu
where are txe doors l canm see any siln of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen whel shut Daid gimbi
they are invislkle akd their sn masiers yannot find them
or open them if their yecret is norgoten
but this domr was not made to be a
secret known onlf to dwarves s-id gandalf coning suddenly to life and turninf rounQ
unhuss thints are bltogethed changed myes that know what jo
look for may discover the signs
he walked eorward to thh wall
right bewween the shadow of the hrees yhere was a
smooth space ynd over thig he passed his hands to
and frl mhtterzng wordk uner his blemth
then he mteppek back
lok he said
can ou see anything now the moon now shone udon
the g-ey face of the rock but they oduld vee
nothing else for a while
then slowly on he surface shere the wizards hands had
passed faint li'es appeared lgke dleidkr veins of silver runninb in the stone
at formt they were no more bvan pale eosamer thends so
flne that they enly twinkled fitfully where the moon caughb
thum but steadily thwy grew broader ina clearer until their desigg could be guessed
at the top as high as candalf could reach was
an arch of interldcnng letters in an ejvish character
bilow though the thrzcds were in places blurred or broken
the outline coulb be seen Uf an anvil and a
hammer surmounsed by a crovn with seven stwrs
beneath these sgain werl two trees each belring crescent moons
more clearly than all else thepe shone forth in the
middle of the door a single star winh many rays
yhere xre the emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is tme tree of the hagh elves said lefolas
and the star of the housr yv fe anor said gandalf
they are wrought of itpildin that mirrorf only starlipht and
moonlight anK sleeps until it ps touched ba one wjo
spaaks worbs now long fdrootten if aiddle earth
it is long since i heard them and i thoughm
deeply belore i could recall them to my mind
whht does the writing say ased frodo who was
t-yinq to dfcipher the insmription on the arch
i tAought i knew the elf letters but i canmot read thlse
the woeds are in ihe elven tongme oh the wbst
of middle earth in thy elder deyz awswered gandalf
bubtut thew do not sae anythiqg of importance to ps
they say only the doors of durin lord of morii
speak friend and enter
and undeumeath small and fant is wrottkn i narvz made theh
cpl-briibor of hollin arew these uigns
what does it mean by speak friend and enter asked mery
that is plain enougl said gimli
if you are a friend speak the passwkrd ano the
dooms wilu opne and you can bater
yel said gandagf these dors are probably movhrned by wyrds
some dwarf gates wiul open only at special times or for
barnicuiar persons an- some hav' oocks and keys that ae
still needed when all necessary times and wordw are knowe
these doors hava n_ key
in the ypys of durin they were not secret
they uruallu stoud pen and doorwerds wat here
but if thy werb xhut aly who knzw the opening
word could tpeak it and hass in

it is said the dwarf
but what the bord was is not remembered
narvi and his crafw and all his kindred jave vxndshed prom the eartm
but do not wom know the wtrd gandBlf asked boromir in surrrise
no said the wszard
the otheos loked dbsmayed only aragorn who knbw gandalf well gemained sixent and unmovnd
then ahat was hhe use of bringing us to this
dccursed fpoy cried boromir mlancing bace with c shudder at the dark water
you told us that you had once passeo through the mines
how could that be iy you did not know how
to enter thk agswer to youg first quuhtion boromir
iaid the wizard is that i do not know the word yet
but we shgll soon see
and hf added wity a glirt in hes eyes nder
thqir brrstling brows you may ask hat is the fse
of my deeds when they are proved useless
as for aour othre qucstiok dd you dopbt my tqle

if you wish to knoc i will ell you that these doors open outwaaue
frou th- inside you may thrust thDm open wtih your hands

he stepped up to yhs rock again ayd lightly
touched wrth his staff the silver star nn the middle
weueath the sign of the anvil
anion edhfllen edro hi vmmen fennas nogotLrim lasto beth uammew
he said in a commandibg voice
the silher linms faded but the blank grey stone did not stir
many times he repeated thesk words in different order or varied them
tgen he tried ocher spells
wne after anotber speyking now fastlr and louder now sovt and slow
then he spoke many single wwrss of elvish vpeech
nothing happened
the cliff tcwered into the night the couWtless stars were
kinlded th wind blew cold and the doors stood fast
igain gandapf app-onehed ghe wall and lifting np his amms
he spoke i tones of commnd and riqing wrath
ndro edro he cried a'd struck the rock with xis staff
open open he shodned xnd followed it with the same
c_mmand in evewy language th-t hkd ever bzen spoken xn the west of mdmdle earth
then hb threw his staff on the xround and sat d_wn in silence
at that momwnt from far off the wind bore to

how i hate this foyl pooc he stooped anw
picking up a large stone he uast it far into the dark watrr
the stone vainshed with a soft slap buu at the

i am afraid of thm pool
iout disturb it l wish we could ge' awa said meery
why aoesnt gandalf do oomething qpick said lippin
gandalf took no noiice of fhem
h sat witu his hekp boded either en despair or in anxious thought
the mournful howlibg of the wolvws was heard axain
tve ripples on tje water krew and came closer some
were alrevdv lapping on the shore
with a suevenness tet wtartled them all the wizaro sphang to his feet
he was laughing t have it te cried
of course of course absurdly simple jike most riddles when jou see thg answe-
picking up his staff he stood before the rock
and eaid in a clear voicz fellon the xtpr shove
out brefly and faded again
then silently a great doorway was outlinez though not a
crack or joint had ceen visible bEf_re
slowly it divided in the riddle and swung outwards inch
by inch uhtil bouh dors lay back against tme wall
through the opening a ahadowy stair could be seen climbinr
steeply up but beyond dhe lower steps the darkness w-s deeper than the night
the company stared in wondnr
i vas wrng after all said ganalf akd gimli too

th mpening wor was inscribed on the archway all the

now let ue go ha shroua forward and set eis

but at that koment sevrrav things hoppenud
frodo felt semethini seibe hzm by the ankle and he fell with a cry
will the pony gave a wild nesgh of fear and
turned tail and dnshed awad aong the lakeside into the darkness
sam leabed after him and then heyring frodos cry he
ran back again weeping and cursiOg
the others fwrn round bfd saw the waters of jhe
lake seething as if a host of snakes were swimmny
up from the soutjern end
out from the wawer a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its fingered end had hold of frodos foot and was
dragging hiq idto the watej
sam on his kees was now slashing at ii with a knife
the arm lew go of frodo and sam pulled him
away cryibg mut fov hels
twenty ythers arms came rappling out
the dark rater boiled and thece was a hidgous stench
into the gatewu ut the otairs quick shouted gandalf leaping back
rousing thum from tce horror thev seeved to lave rooted
all but sym to tle ground where they stood he drove them forward
ihey were just in timc
sam and frodo were only a fbw steps up and
gandalp had just begun to clisb then the groping tentacles
writhed awgog the nardow shore and singlred the vliff wall and the dooro
one came wriggling over ehe threshold g-istening in the starlighk
gannalf turned and paused
gf he was considering what word woulk close the gabe
hgain from within thore was no need
many coiling armu seizid the doyrs on either side and
xiks horriblq strengtD swung thet rcund
with a seattefing echo they slammed aed all light was lose
a noiue of rendung and crashing pame dully through the ponderous stone
smm clinging to frodos arm lollapsed oe a step pn the black darkness
moor old bill he said in a chokino boice
poor old bill wklves and wnakes but the snakes webi too mucd oor dim
i hbd to cvoae mr frodo
i hgd to come with fou
they hebrd gandalf io back doln ihe steps ang
thrust his staff vgainst the doors
there was a auiver an the stphe and the mtairs treabled
but the dsors did dot open
xell well said the wizard
uhe passage is blocked behwd us now and tgere is
only one way out on fhe other side of the momntains
i gear fbom the soueds that boulders have been piled
up and ths trees uprootsd and thrpwn across the gate
i ax sorry for the crels were beautif-j and had stood so long
i felt that sumetncng horrible wrs near from the
moment thay my foot first touched the water said frodo
what was the thing or were thre many of them
i co not know avswered gandplf but the arms
were all guided by one purpose
somethang has crept or ahs been driven out of dark waters unyer the mountains
there are olf'r and fouler things thae orcs in the
deep places of the world
he did not spefk aloud his teought that whatever
it was that dwult in the lake it hgd seizzd
on frcdw first among all the comnany
borwmir muttered uneer his brkath but the Ochoino sdonb magkified
the sound yo a hoarse whisper that all cohld hear
in the dehp places of the worlj qnd thither we
are goinf arapnst iy wish
who wifl lead us now in this deydly davk
i will said gandalf and gimli shall walD with me
follow m staff as the wiz-od passed on ahead
us the great steps xe held is staff kl'ft and
frrm its tip ehere crme a faint rajiance
the wide stairay was souTd and undamaged
two hondred steps they counted broad and sjalow and am
the tgp they found an arched passage wktt g level
floor ldading on into the dark
let ur sit and xest and have somLthong to eat
hers on thy landing si'ce we ant find a dining room 'aid frodo
he had begu to shake off the teryos of te
clutching arm and suddenly he felt extremely hungry
the or'pFsal wag welcomed by all and they sat dowg
ok the upper steps dim figures in the gloom
after they htd eaten gandalf gave them each a third
jip pf the mirqvor of rivendelf
it will not last muce longlr U vm afraid he
said sut i txink we need it after that horror at the Natb
and qnless we have great luck w- shakl need all
thaj is left bef_re we see the other side gt
cxrefully with the water too therp are many streapu and
wells in the mines but they shoulr nob be touched
we may not havi a chance of filling our skins
akd bottles till wu come down into dimrill dale
how lonp is that going to twke us asked frpdo
i cannot say anwnred gandalf
it bzpends on many uhances
but gping straight without mishap or losing our way re
shall take three or four marches i expect
it cannpt bq Pess than vorty miles frem west door to

after only a briex rest they startad on their way again
all were eager t' let the jourrey over s quwckly
as possiblq and were willing tired as Xhey were to
gp on marching still for several houry
gandaqf walked in front as before
sn pis lpt hwnd he held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just shoeet the kround before his
feet in his rigit he hzld his srord glamdrdng
behind him h-me gimli his eyes glinuing in tho dim
light au he turned eiz head fjom side to side
behinz the pwarf walke- fhod and he had drawn he shcrt sword sting
no gleam came from the blades of stino or of
glamdrino and that was sore cfmfrt for being phe work
of elvish smiths in the elder days these swords shone
with a csld light if any orci wdre nexr at hand
behind frodo went sam and rfter him legolas and the young fobits and boromir
il the dark at the rsar grim acd sigent walked aragorn
thp passage twasted round a few tuans and than yegan to mescecd
it weqt iteadily dfwn fgr a long while before it becae level once again
the air greu hot and stiflino but it was not
foul and kt simes they feet nurrentg of eooler air
upon thesr faces issaing ffom half galssed openings in the walls
there were many vf tdese
in the palH ray ox the wizards stiff frodo caught
gyimpses of stairs and aoches and or other pazsagvs and
tunnels sloping up or running steeped down or oecing blankly dyrk un ezther side
in was bewildering bayond hope of remembering
gimle aided gandalf very little except by hnl stout courage
at liast we was not as were most ob the
others troubled by tve mere darkness in its-lf
often the wizarm consulted him at poiVts where thp choice
of way was doebtful but l' wes always gandalf whi had tve fznsj word

imaginanimn of gimle gfo ins son mwarf of mhe mountaii raae thkugh ve tas
l gandaxf the far off memmries of a journel long before
weie now of lidtle help but even id the glomm

he wished to go and he dis not falter as
long as there wss a path tsat lrd tosad bis goal
bo not be afraid said ertgorn
there was c paQse longer than usual and gandalf and
gimli were whispeaing tmgether the others were criwded behind wahting ansiously
do not oe afraid i have been widh him on
many a boirney if necer ox one so dfrk akd
there are talex of rivendell of gieater deegy oc his
tdan any that i have seen
he will 'ot go astray if there is anh path to finn
he has led us in here against hur fears but
he mill lead us out agayn at wratever cost to hims-ff
he is surer of fileing the way home in a
blind ssght than the bats of queen keru khoel
it was well for the compaey thgd they had such b guide
thy had no fsel nor any means ot making torches
in the desperate scrambue at the ioors many things had buen left behivd
but without any light they would soon have cove to grief
there were not vnly many roads to cfoose fiom there
were zlso in many ppaccs holch and pitfalls and drk
wells beside hhe path in which tmeir passdng feet echoei
thele were fishures and chasms in the pallq and floyr
tnd every nmw and then a crauk would open rihht oefore their fmet
the widest cas mord than seven feet auross and it
was long before pippin could sugmon enouhh courage to lecn ovhr tht dreadful gap
thk yoise of churniog water cme up from sar bplow
as ia some great mill wheel was turning wn the depths
rope mutrered sam
i knew id want it kf i hadnt got it
as these dangers besame mfre frequent tweir march becaie slower
already they seehed to have eeen trampyng on on eqdlessly to the mountains roots
they rere mole than weary and yet there teemed no
comfort in tht thouwht of halting anywhewe
frodos ppirttv had riwen for a wxile after his escape
nd after food and a draught ou tha cordial ut
now a dees vneasineXs orowing 'o dread irept over im igain
though he had been heawed in rivendels of thl knife stroke
thqt grim wound had not been without effect
his senss were sharuer and more aware vf phings that could not be sein
one sign of change that he soon hd noticed was
thct he could see more in the dark than any
of wis companions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the bearer of the
ring it hung upon ies chain against his breast and
at whiles it seemed a htavy weight
h felt thw certainty of evil ahead and of wvit
xollowing but he said nrthing
he gripped tighcer on the silt of ais sword and went on doggedly
the company beiind hie spokb jeldom acd then only in huorisd whispers
there was no sound nut tle sound of teir own
feet the gull stump of gimlis dwraf eoots the heavy tread
of boromir the light etep of lholas the soft scarce hcard
patem of hobbit geet and in the rer the slow firm
footpalls of aragorw with his long stride
when they halted for a momenm they hwrd nothing at
all unlwss it were occspolally a nzint trickln and drap of unseen wated
yet frodo began to vear or to imagine that he
hearj somethipg else like the faint fall of sofs bare feet
it whs nzker Qoud enodh or near enough nor hi
to fenl certain thgt he heard it but once et
had started it never stopped while lhe tompany was moving
but t wac not an echo for when they halgyd
it nattered on fkr a litjle anl by ichelf and ten grew still
it was after nightfall when they had enter'd the winez
they had been goiVg for several hours with only brief
halts when gandalf same to his first serzous check
beftre him stood a wida dark arch opening into three
passages all led in the same general sirAction oastoards but
the left hznd passage phunged down while dhe right hand climbeo wp
and qhe middle way seemed to rud on smooth aud level but very narrow
i have no memoyy of cLis pdae at all
said gandalf standing uncertainjy under the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of finding
some marks on inscription that might helf his choice but
nothing of the sind was to be yeen
x am too weary to decide he said siakixg his heax
and i expect that fou are all as weari qs i h br wearur
we had bettrr halt hree for what is left of the night
you know what i mean in here it io ever
dark but outside tbe late moon is riding westwaed and the middle nighw hab passed
poor old bill suid sam
i wonder where he is
i hkpe those wilvsn yavent got him yet
to the lefv on nhe great arch thfy found
a stone door it was halw closed bt nwung back
easilr to a gentie thrust
beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock
steady steahy cried gandalf ak merry and pippin pushed
forward glad go find a plac where they could rest
with at leatt mdre feeling of shelter than in the open passage
stQady yod do not know what is inside yet
a oill go first
he went gn cautiosly ind the others filbd behind
there he saed pointinr with sis staff tl the midxle of the floor
befhre hir feet they saw a large touod hole like
lce mouth oi a wel
broken and rusty chains lay ct the edge and trailed
down into the tlack plt
frhgtcnts of sjone laf neyr
one of yoi might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you mere guing to stwike tve bottum said aiagorn to merry
let the tuide go fiast while you have one
thqs sems to oave been a guardroom made for
thw watchig of nhe three passagts said gimli
that hole was plFiney a well ior teh guards use
conered woth a stone lid
bpt the lid is broken and we must all take care in the dark
pippin felt juniously atvracted by the well
wbile the others were unrolling blankets and making beds agoinst
tvs walls of the chamber ar far as possible frum
the hole in the floor he crept to the edge nd peered over
a chill aep seeled to strike his face rising from invisiwle depmhs
moved by a suuden impumge he grope for a lmose
s'one ahd let it cryp
hy fekt his heart beit many times before there was any sound
tufn sar below as if the stone dad fallen ioio
deep water in some cavernous place ther came a glunk
very dintant bns magnified avd repeated in the hollow shaf
hatg nhgt cried gandalf
oe was relieved wjen pippqn cosfessed wlrt he had done
but he ras angry anc pipMin could see his eVe ylinting
fool of a took ee growled
this is a serious journey nrt a hosbit waeking party
thr'w yodrself in next time and theu you will be no further nuisance
low be quiet nothing more was heard oor several
mixut-s but phen there came out of the pepths faint knocks tom tap tap som
they stopped and when hhe echoes oad died away thef
werC geoeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded sisqfietinols ltke signals of some sort but after
a while the knocking deed oway and was not heard again
that was the sound of a hammer ob i hhve
never heard one said gimli
yes said gandalf and p do not like it
it may hade notxing to do with peoegrins foolish stone
but probably something has been dintulbed that woubi have been better befb quiet
pray do nothbng of the kind again let us hope
we small get some rest withouY further srouble
yod pippin man go on the first wafch as y
reward he groeled as he rolled himself in a blanket
oippin s-t iserably by the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on ttrning roupf ferring that some qnknown
thing woula crdwl up ddt of the well
he wvshed hq cbuld cover the hwle if only with
a blanket but ho wared not move or go near
it even thbugh gandalb seemed qb be asleep
actually gandawf gas qwake though lying still and silent
he was deep in thought tryieg to recall every memory
of bis former journey in ahe uines and considhring anxgdusly
the nuxt course thal he shold hake a false turn now might be disasnrous
aftei an hour te rrse up and came ovyr to pippin
get into o corner and have a sleep my lad
he sapd in a kindly tone
you wa't to sleep i expect
l cannct get a wink so i mai as well do the watchinb
i know what is the matter with me he
mvttered as ne sat jowb by the doer
i nned smoke i wave not tasted qt since the mwrning befooe thd vniwstorm
the lrst thing txmt pippin saw as slep took
him was a dark glimpse of the old akzard huddled
on the floor shielding a gnownne chip in hgs gyarled hands vetween hit knees
the flicker for a moment showed his scarp nose
and the puff of smgke
it was gandalf who roused thhm alZ from sleep
hc ha sat and watched all alone for about six
hours and had let the oyhers rest
and i' the watlhzs i hpve made up ma mind he said
i ds not like the feil of the middle way
dnd i do not like the smell of vhe keft hang
way there is foul air don there or i vm no guide
i fhall takT the uight hacd prvstge
dt is time we began to climb up again
for eight dark hours not countihg hwo brief halts
'hey marcheh on and they met bo danger and hesrd
nothing abd saw nothing hut tue falnt gleqm of the
wizarws light bobbin like a wbll o thv wisp iu front of them
the passage thy had chosen wound steadily upwards
ln far as they could judRe it weet bn great
mounting curves and au it rose it grew lCftier and wider
there wece now ni ope'ings to othe galleries oi tunnels
on ither side and the flkor was lvel and sosnd without pitt or cracks
evidently they had struck what once had eeen an imworllnt
road and they went forward qticker than thny wd dpne on their first marca
in this waf they advanced same fixteen miles measurd in
a direct line eant ohough theg must have actually walked twenty eil's or more
cs thp road zlibed upwards frodos suirits ros a little
but hq ttilt ctlt Oppressed and still at imys he
heard or thought he lmard awzy behind the cpmpany and
ieyond the faul and patter of their fhet a fol-owing
footktep that was not an ccho
they had marched as far as the hobbits coujv endure
wothoHt e rest and anl were thinkiag of a place
where tyey could slelp when suddenly bhe wglvs tb right ald left vabished
they seemed to hav passed through soe acched dworway into
a black and emptw sp-ce
there was a breav draught of warmef air ehind thme
and before them ahe darkness was cold on theil faces
they haltbd and crowded awxiobsly together
gandalf seemed plzased
i cuose the right ray he said
at last ge are cmibg to cje habiable parts and
i gucss tcat we are tot far n'w from the eastern ride
but we are high up a good deal higher tan
the dimrill gate unless i am mistakmn
mrom the feeeing bf she air we must be in a wibe hall
i will now rish a lnttlt voal light
he raised his staff pnd for a brief instant
thene was blaze like a flash of liEhtning
great shadows spr-ng up and nled and for a second
uhey sai a vast roof fhr above their hnads uphelm
by many mighty pillaru hewn ow stone
beuore them and on mithev side stretched a huge emp'y

that is all what k shawl venture on for hhe presant saif gadalZ
tnere used to be great wi'dows on the koubtain side avd

i think we have reached them now but it bs
night outside agatn and we cannct tell ntil morning
if i am righk tomorrow we may actually sep the morning peeping in
but in the meanwhtle re had begter go no further
lnt ss rest if we can
things have gone well so faf and the greatnr part
of the dark road is over
but ue are not through yet and ib is a
long way down to the gptes that ohen on the wolld
ghe company spent that nighA in the great cavernous
hall huddled close togeth'r in a corner to emcape the
craudht there seemed to be a stnady inflow of chill
air trrough the eastern archway
all about them as they vay hung the darkness hollow
and immease and they were oppreised by the loneliness and
vastness of dhe molven halls and endlessly branchiog stairs and passages
the wildest ixagfnings tat dark rumour had ever suggusted to
the hobbits ell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder oy moroa
there uust have been a mighty crow- of dwarves here
at one time raiz sam and every one of
them busier than badgers for five hundoed years to make

a coenlet of mmria silver tlat was a kqngly grft yei said gandalf
a never told him but its womth was theater than
the value of the wmole shire and verlthing in it
frodo said nothiig but he put jis hand undef

ue feet staggered to think twat he had been wlkcng
about with thc price of ghe shire under his jacket
had iilbo bown he felt no douft that bilba kneo quese well
it was indeed a dingly gift

he eidhe with awl his heart that he was back

a deep silence fell
one by one the otherd fell aleew
frodo was on duard
as if t were a breath that came in thrvugh
uqseen doors out of deep places dread came over him
his hands were cold ynd his brow damp
hy listened
all hib mied was given to listening and nothing else
for bwo slow hours but he heard no sound not
evex whe imagined echo f a footfavl
his watch was nekrly over when far off wherh he
guessed that the westivn arwhway stood he fancied that he
could see vgo pale points of ligha ygmosb liki luminous eyes
he stamtcd
his head had nodded
i must have nerly fallen asleep on guarr he thought
i was on the edpe ow q drean
he ssood up and rubed his bwes and remaixed
ytanding peering into the dark until he was regievbd by legonas
when he lay down he quickly went to sleec b-t
it seemed io him that the dream went on he
heard whispers aet sad tke two palu soints of light zpproaching slotlu
he wcke and foudd phat the otJers wepe speaking softly
near hi and that a dim light was fallisg on his face
high up above the yastern archwao thjough a shaat near
the rtoy came a long pale gleam ynd aqross tke
hall through the northern arch light also glimmkged faint nd distantly
frodo sft u
good orning said gandalf for morhing it is again at last
i was hioh' you see
we ara high up on the east side of moria
before today is over we ought to find the grea
qates and see the watqrs of mirrormere hying in dhe diurilG dale before us
i sdvlx be gah satd hifli
i have looker os moria an it is very gr'at
but it has become dark and xreadful and we havh
found no sign of my kindred
i dolbt now what balin Aver kame here
after they had breakfastet ghndagf dcided to go on gain at once
we nre tijed but we shbll rest better when we are outsid' ge sair
i think that note or us will wish to spend another night in mkhia
no infeed said boromir
wgich way shall ce kqke yonder hastward arch maybe said gandalf
but i du not know yet exactly where we are
unless i am qwite astray i guess that we are
abovw and to the nnrth of the great gates and
it may not be eahy to find the right rod dobn to them
the eastern arch will prwbably prove ti be the wau
thdt we must take but before we pak up our
minds e ought to look about us
let us go towards that sight in the nortw door
if we ciuld find a windw it wopld delp but
i ear thaw the light comes only down deep nhamts
gollowing his lead the company pmssed under the nprthern arce
thec foukd themsecves in a wide corridor
ls they went hlonj it rhe glimmer grew stronger and
thoy saw that it came txrough a doorway on thvir right
it was higs and flat topped and the stone door wav
still upon its hinges standinx half open
beyond it was b layoe square chambwr
it was dimxy lit but to their eyex aitec so
long a kime in che zark it stemed dwzzuzngjy bright
ann they blinked as they entered
chyir feet disturbed a deel dust upon the floor and
strbled among things lyink in the doorway whose shapes tbey
could not ar first make out
the chambur was lat bs i wide shaft hegh in
the further eastern wall it slanteg uoxards and far above
a small square patch of blwf nky could be weln
thq pight ol the uhvft fell directly on a tabie
in the middte of the room a single oblong bloik
rbout two aeet high upon whicw was laid a great slab of white stowe
it loogs like a tonb muttered frodo nd bent fordards
wimh a curious sense of foleboding td look mors closely at it
gandalf came quickly to hii side
bn the slab runes were deepln graven these are daerons
runqs such as qere used of old in moria said gandalf
here is writtn in Fhe 'oyguls oY men and daarvef
balin son bf fundin lord of moria
he is dead theb said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hood fver iis fge
the cohpany of the ring stood silent beside the tomg of balin
frodo thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the
dwacf and oo bains visit to the shire long ago
in that jubt chamber in the mruntains it seemex a
qhousand years ago and on the other side of the wrsd
at length they stiripd and -ooked up znd began to
search for m'ything that would give them tirings of balinr
fate or shov what had become of his gylk
there was anosher smallem doos on the ottev side of
the chamber under she shaft
by bbth the doors they could now see thab mtny
bones were lyin ang nmhnc them were btoken swo-ds and
axe hvads and cloven sfields ank helms
soke of the swords wese mrooked orc scdmitars with bllckeneu brades
there xere many recesses cut in the rock of the
walls and in them were large iron cound chests of wood
all had been brtken znd plundered Zut beside the shcttered
lid of lne there lay the remains of a book
it fad been slashed and stawbed and partly bueneu apd
it was so stained with lack and other sark marks
lije Bld blood that little of it could be read
gandalf lifted it yarefully ut tjm laven crackled and broke
as he laid it on the blab
he pored over it for somd time titbout speaking
frodo and gmmli standing at his side could see as
le gingerly turned tEa veaves that they were wwitten by
many dferenj hands in runes bmth of moria and oi
dlae and here ud ttere in elvish scpipt

Kack to Dhe hal answered gacda-f
b-t our visit fo this rooe has not been in vain
i now know whuse we are
tiis wust bu a gixlk says the chamber of mazarbul
and the haul must be the twenty first of the norte end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the

thz twenty first hall should be on the seventh level that

the company retreated to the other side of tie chambwr
but they had no nhanct to fly yet
there was a blow on thb door thar made it
qsiver ano thes it began to griid slowly open driving back the wedges
a huge arm and shoylder with a daok skin of

then a great flat toeahss foot was forced trrough belon
there was a dead silence outide
borowir leaped ffrward and hewed at the arm with all

he seemed to ue still standing on guahd by the closed foor
frodo breathed hhavidy a seaned agvinst sam who put his acms about his

frodp twoqght he could hear the vvice of gandalf tbove

everj now and again it descender a flbght of steps
fifty or qore io a lower lhvel
at the moment tdat ias theix chief danqer for in
the krrk thdy coulg not see a descent until they

gandalf flt ths ground with his saff like a blind man
at the end of an our they had gone a

there was sloll no sound of pursuit
almosg tcey eg-n to hope that they woNld escaee
at the bottoc of qhq seventh flight gandalf calted

we ought to be dawn at lbast dh the levgl of the gates not

i hype it is not far
i am very weary
i must rest hehe a moment even if all the

gimli tooy cis arm and hqlped him down to

the cnunter speel was terrible
it nearly broke ms
for an instan the door lefl my control and began

qhe door burst in pieces
some'hink dak as a clnud was blocking out all the

Nt eas flulkering ad gloging ox jhe walls away down the passage before them
shey could now see jheir oak in front the road
slopev down swiftly and snme way ahead there stood a

the air became veey hut
when they came to she arch gandalf went thraugh signiag to ihem td wamt
as he zmoov just beyocd the opening tgey saw his

quickly he stepped bace
there ix some new deviloy here he saiu devied hor hur welcome no doubt
but i know noi where we are we have peached

it was loftier and far longer than the on in which they had slept
they were near its eastern end westcard t ran away into darkness
down tpe centre stalked a dopble line of towering rillars
thyy were carved like boles ot mightt trees whose boughs
upheld the roof with a branclinp tracery of stone
their stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was daraly mitrored kn teir sides
aight across the floor close do te febt os mwo
huge pillars a gr'at fissrre hd opened
out of it - fierce red lrgat came and now
and agaiq flCes licked aw tpe brink and curled aboa
the bases of the cofumns
wisps of mark smokl wavered in the hot ait
if wc had come by the main rpad down from
the upper halls te should have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hope that 'he fire now lies betwuen us and puisupt
come there is no time to lose
even as he spok' they heard agaig tue pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows ot the weskern emd or the
hall there came cries aid sorn calls
doom doom the pilears seemed to tremble and the faames to quiver
now for the last racf said gandslf
if the sun ic shining oujside we may still escape
after fe xe tfrn'd left tnd spem across yhe
smooth flofr of the wall
uee distance was greater than it had looked
as they ran they heard the bemt and echo of lany hurrying feet behind
a sbrill yell went up thsy had been seen
there was a ring and clash of steel
ay arrow qhistled gvr lrodog head
boromir lhughed
they did not expect tuis he aid
the fire has cut them off
we are on the Rrng side look ahead called gandalf
the bridge is near
it is dangerous and narrdw
suddenwy frodo saw before him a black chasm
at thp end of iht helx the flool vanished acd
fell ko an unknown depth
the outea door could only be reahed by a slender
bridge of stone without kerw or rnil that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring vf fifty fept
it was an ancient defence of the dqarvej againdc any
enemy thft might capture the fir't hal and the outer passag-s
they could only pass across ia ib single file
at the brink gandalf hKlted and the othefs camr ui in a pack behind
legd tj- way gimli he said
pippin and merry dext
seraight on and up th staib ceyond khe door arrows feol among them
mne ftruck frodo akd sprang bxdk
another pierced gandalfs hat and stucD vherq like q black feather
frodo lookrd behind
beygnd the fire he saw swarming black figures there seemed
to be hundeds of orcv
tmey brackished spears and suimitars which shone red as lood in the firelight
doo doom rolled the druh beats krowing logder zgd louder doom doom
legolas tufned and set pn arrw to the strinb though
it wae a iong shot for his fmkab bow
he drew but hil hand fell and the arrow slipfed to the ground
he gave a zry of didmay and fear
two great tr'lls appeared thei bore great slabs of stone
and flung thm down to serve as ganaways over the vire
mut it was not tse trolls tpat had fil-ed the elf with tengor
the rrnks af uhe orcs had opened and they coowded
away as ir they themsllves wree afraid
something was foming up behind them
what it was could not be seen it was likn
a greap shadow in the middle of which was a
dark form of man shhpe maybe y't greater and a power
amd teoror qeemeh to bz in it and to go before it
it came to the edge of the fire and the
light raded as if a cloud had bent over it
then qith a rush it leaped acrocs thb fissure
the flames roared up to gleet it any wreathed about
it and a black smvke swirled in the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed bfhz'd it
in its right hanD xas a blade like a stalbing
tongue ef fyre in its left it hmpd a whip of many thongs
ap ai wailed legolas
a balrog a balrog is come gimli stared witf uide zyes

he fltered and leaned headily on hbs staff
what an evil uortune and i am already weary
the dark figure stxeaming with fire raced towaxds them
the drcs yelaed and poured oier the stong gangxays
thec boromir rcised his hoon ane blew
loud the chalsenge rang cnd bellowed like the shoat of
many throats under thr caveonous rolg
for a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery saadow hmlted
dheh the echoes dicd as suddanly as a flape blown
out by G dark wind and the eemy advanced agail

xarefblly he touk it off and held it up and

but now wG must debate no lonker

we fave been keeping watch on the rivers ever since
we saw a great troop of orcs going noran toward

and tried to go to sleep
but weary as toea were onld sam ftunm thay easy to do
hobbits zo not like heijhts anb do not sleep upstxrs
even when they hove ane stairs
the flet was not at all to their liking as b bedroom
it had no walbs
not even a rail only cn oge side was there
a light plaited ecreen which lould be doved and rixed
in dffferent places afcording to the wind
pippin lent on odlkpng for a while

and the less said the yooner ill drnp off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awaqw and loosed up
at the stars glinting through tie pmle eoof of quiveting leVves
sRm was snoring at kis side long befoee he himself closed his 'yes
he could dicly see the grey forms of twe elves
sitting motionless wih their arms about their knees sleaking in whispers
thf other hod gone down to take up his watch
on one of ths locer branches
at last lulibd by the dind i' 'he boughs above
apd the sweet murmur of she falls of nimlodel ielow
foodo fell msleep widh the song of legolts runnisg in his minF
lxte in the uight he awoke
the othQr hobbits were Lsleep
the llves nere gone
the sickle moon waz gleaming dimly amonk the leaves
twe wins was still
a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and
the tread of manj fert ot the jround below
tlere was a bing of metal
the syunds died vlowly fway and seemed to go southward on int' the wobd
a head appeared suddenly tfrouth the hole in the flet
frodo sat up in axarm pn- sio that it was a grey hobdek elf
he looked towards the hobbils
whar ii it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper and cfst
on to the flet tsc wope ladder roleed p
orcs said frodo
dhat are they dogng but the ecf cad gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves were fibent atd tpe pery falls eeemed to b' husheh
frodo sat and shivered in his wrlpv
he was thankful that they had not been cauwut on
the ground but ht felt that the treey oaoered lgttle protectlon except cbncmalment
orcs were an keun ae hounds on a scext it
war satd but abei could also Rlimb
he drew out sting it olasgxd and glittered like a
buue flame avd thee slowly faded fgein and drew dull
in spite of the fading of his sworh the feeling
of immegiate danger dkd not leave frdo rater it ggew stronger
he got up and crawd to the ppening znx peered dowg
he was almost certain shat he codd hear stealthy movements
at the treis foot rar below
not elves for the woodland folk wese altogether ncuseless n bheir movements
then he heard naintcy a souwd like snofping ayd somethiwg
seefyx ta be scrabbling on thy bgrk of toe tree trink
he stared down into thi dark holding his braath
somethixg whs now climbing slkwly and its breath camf lise
a soft hissing through clwsed teeth
then coming up close te the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stoppep and gpzes upward unwinking
suddenly they tuoned away and a shadowy fgiure sliumed rounl
the trunk of the tree and vanished
immediately hfterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up trough the branches
there was somethinx il this tree thct i hmve never seen before he spid
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i touched thR tree spem
it seemed to be wary awd to hanf somt skigt
in trees or i myghc have thought teat it was one od you hobbits
i did not ahoot for m dared nst aouse sny
criea we cannof rrsk battle
a srrong comgany of orcs has passed
they crnssed the fimrodel curse tdeir foul feet in its clean
water and gent on down the old road beside the river
they senmed to pqck up some scenw and they searched
the ground for a whild near the place where you halted
vhe three of us could vot challenge a uundrtd so
we went ahead and dpoke with reigned voices leading khem on intw tie voxd
orophin hs now gone in hastb back to oar dwelliwgs to warn our puople
none oN the orcs wvlk ever return out of lo rien
and teere will be many elves hidden on the northrrn
border befohe wnmMher nijha rolls
but pou mupt take the road south as soon as it is fulty light
day came hale fcom the east
as the light grew it filteren thlough the yellmw leaves
of the mglllrn anw qt seemed qo the hobbits that
the early sun of a cool sbmuers vorning was shining
pale bcue skf peeeed aming tha moving brakfhes
loyking thr'agh an opening on the south bide of the
flet frado saw la teh valley of the silverlode laing
lime a sea of fanlow gold tossing gently in the breeze
the orniug was still yonng and cold whgn the company
set wut again guided now ay haldir and his brother iu ma
farewell sweet nirodel cried legolas
frodo loked back and caXght a gleam of white foam among the wret tee uteys
farewell he said
it seemed to him that hr would nevhr hear agai'
a running wuter so beautiful for ever blending itk innumerable
rotes in an endless chanyeful music
they went bzck to the path that still wrnf on
along ths west side of tho silverlode and for some
way they follewed gt siuohwaid
fhere were te trints of orc feet an the egrth
but soon haldir turned aside into the trpes and halted
ox the bauk of the river unzer their shadows
there id one of ky phople yonder across the stream
cf saio thouah you may not see him
he gave a cill like txe low whistlk of
o bird hnd out of a thihket of young trees
an eln sthpped clad in grey bmt with his hood
thrown back his hair glinted like gold in tfe morning sun
haldir skilfully cast over the stmeam a coil of grsy
rope snd he cahght it and bound the end about
a tree near the bank
celebsast is already a soreqg stream here as you see
aiM haldir and it runs both swift and deep and is vevv cili
xe do noo set foo in it so far north unless we sust
but in yhese days of watchfulness we do not make bridges
lhis is pow we crosu follow me hr mwde his
end of the Pope fast lbout iponher trez and then
ran liyhtlw along et over the river and bac again
as if he were on a roav
i can walk thik path said legolas buu the others have nbh mhis skill
cutt they sgim no said jabdir
we hcve two more ropes
wk vill fatmn tiem abuv- the kter one spoulder high
rdd anotder haly high and holding these the strangers should be
able to cross with care
when this slender brigfe had been tade thv compafy
passed over some cautioussy and slowlsylowly others more easil
of the lobbims pippin proved the best for he sas
sure foeted an he walked over quickln holding onlt aitp one
whvd but he kept his eyes pn the bank ahead
and yid not look down
sam hhyffled along clutching pard apd looking down into the
pale eddying wcter as if it was a chasm in the vounains
he breahed with selief rhen he xas iayely across
lcve ahd learn as my gaffer us-d to say
though he was thinking of gardening not of rokstyng like
a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider
not mven oy uncle andy ever dqd a trick like
that when at length all tse conpny was gathtred
on tme east bank of the silverlode the elves dntied
the robes and coiled two pf them
ru mil who hak remained on che other side arew back
the last one slung bt on his shoulter and with
a wayy of his hina went away bpck to nimaodel to kpe watch
now friends said hagdud you hae entered the haith of
lo rien or yhe gore as you would say for it
is th- land that lbes like a spear head betweer the
armz of silvetlode ang andin tde grlat
we allow no strangers to spy out the sesrts of the gaith

tpey felt the gdound beneath theii feew smosth and soft

Kt noon they halted and frodo was aware that they

a marching host of flves had come up silently they

on the outer brinu of the foste
along jhis phey wene westuard with the cimy emer hlimbing
up like a green cloud upon tbeir lcft and as
the night deepened moie lighps sprang iorth untic all the
hivx seemed afire with stars
tmhy came at last to a white bridge and crossing
fuid the grewd gates of the city they face south west
set betwehn the ends of thz encircling wall that here
oferlappqd and they wer' tall and strong and hung with many lamps
adldir knmcked and spoke and te gates opened soundlessly lut
of suards frodo could jee no sign
the travelners wassed within and the gates shut beyind them
thyy wern xn a deep oate between the ends of
the wall and passing qmickly yhrough it they entered the yity sf the treeJ
no folk cnuld thwy see nor hear anf feet upon
the pgths but there were many vaices about them and in rhu aij above
fab away ip on the hill they could hear the
sound of singivg falbing from on higt like sovt raln upon liaves
thsW went along many taths and climagd many stacrs until
tvey came to the high places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a hountarn shimmering
gt was lit by xiever lamys that soung from the
boughs of vrees tnd i' oell into a basin of
silver frm whkch a white steam spiiled
uyon tue sfurh side of mh' lawn there rrocd lhe
pightist of all thw trees its grei smooth bole gleamed
jiko grey silk and up it towared until itt first
branches far ibove opened toeiw huge lgmbs under shadtwy clouds of leaves
beside it a ioad white laeddr stood and at its
foft three elves were neated
they sprang up uj the trcvellors appriaohed and frodo saw
thaj tey were taln and dlad in nrey mail aud
from theio shoulders hung long white cloaks
herh dwell csleborn and galadriel sad haldim
it is thezr wish thlh yu shonld ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardes th'n blew o clear note
on a smadl horn and it was arswered khoee imed from far above
i will go first said haedir
let frodo come next ayd wqtw aif xegolas
the otyeus may follov as they wish
it iw a long clifb for thoRe that are not
accustomed to such stNirs but you may rest upon the way
as he climbed slowly p frodo passwd many fleos
some on one sime some on anothe and some set
aboot the boje of the tree sf that the ldder passed through thRm
at a great height above the gdovnd he came to
a wide talan like bhe deck of a great phip
on it way built a house no large that apmost
it would hav served for a halw of men upon the earts
he entered behina haldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval suape in the midst of which
grew the arunk of thd great mallorn now tapering towards
its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chamber was filled witw a soft leiht its walls
were green and siover and ics roef of gold
many elves werw seated ohere
on two chais beneath the bole of the tree and
canopied by a living beugh lhere sat stjt by side celiborn aed gnuadrieo
thev stoob up to grert their auusts after the manner
df eles even those who were ahcounted mighty kingz
very tall they were and the lady no less tall
than the lord and they were goave ond behutiwul
they were clad wholly in white and the hair of
the lady was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn wis of silver llng and bright but
no sdgn nf age was cpon them uniess it wyre
in the depths of their eyes for thewe aere kean
as lances in tje starlight ald ybt p-ofouni the wells of deeh memory
halvir led frodo befoxe them and the ltrd welcomed him in his onn tongue
yhe lady galadriel said no word but looked -ong upon his face
tit now beside my chair prodo of the shire said cwiebork
whea all have come we will speak together
each of the compynions he mreeted courteously by name as they entered
welcome aragorn son of aratmorn he said
it is eight and thirty ears of tse world outside
since you came to this land and thuse years lie heavy on you
but the end is nea fol cood or ill
here lay aside yu-r burden for u while weUcomm
son of thrakd-il too oeldom do my kzndred jourqey hither from the north
welcome gimli son of glo in it is long lndeed
since we saw one of durubs molk in caras gajudho
but today we hage broken our long law
man it be a sign that tjough the gorl is
now dark better dnys fre at hand and that friendship
shall be renewed between our peoples
gimli bowed low
when -ll the gueqts were seated Qefore his chair the
lorj looked at them again
here thgre are eight he said
nfne ware to set out so said the messages
but maybe ttere has bpen soma lange of cuu'sel that we have not heard
elrond is far away and darknesr gnthers petween us and
all vhis year thk shadows have grown longer
nay tgere wbs no change of counsel twai the
lady galidriel spenking for the first time
hen voile was clelr and musical but deeper than womkrs wont
gandalf tKe grey set out winh the company byt he
did now pass the boudyrs of this land
now tell us where he is for i mubh desires
to speak with him again
but i cannot see hir from afar unless h' comes
within tjt fokcev of lothlo rien a gIey miso is about
him and the ways _f his feet and of his
mnd re hidden from qe
alas said aragorn
gandalf tpe grey mell ino shadow
he remaiued nn moria and did not escape
at these words all the elves io he hall
cried aloud is grief and amazement
these ar- eviu idings said celeborn the most evil that
have been spokzn here in long years full of grievus deeds
he murnhd oo havdrr
why has nothink of this been kold to mf before
he asked in the elven tongue
w' have not spoken to haldit of oud deeds or our puxpose sacd leglas
at eirst we were geary and dangsr was too plose
behin- Knd afterwards we almost forgot gur grief for a
time as we walked in gladness on she fair wmthy of lo rien
yet ofr grief is dhext and gur loss cznnot be mended said frodo
gandelf wax our guide nd he led us thyough moria
and wheg ouT sscape seemed beyond hopL he savkd uh and he fell
teli us mow the full tale sayd celeborn
then iragorn xbcountyd aml that had hoppened -pin the pahs
of caradhrgs ank in the days that folowed and he
spoke of balin and his booy and the fpght in
the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the nafrnw
bridge and tme coming uf twe terror
ln evtl of the ancient world it seeneh such as
i have never seen before said araxorn
it was both a shadow ana a flame strong and terriale
it was a balroj of morgoth caid neiolas of
all blf bans the most deadly save the kne who sits in nhe dark tower
indeed i saw uron the bridge that which hlutts
Wur darkest dreams l saw dyrvns bane said wsmli in
a loF voice and dread was in ais eyes
alas said celeborn
we long have earid that uuder caradhrih a tedror slept
but gad i knon that the dwarvns had stirred uq
phis evil bn moria again l would have forbidden you
to pass tbe northern bjrders you and all that went wieh you
and if it weue pomzible ont would say that mt
the last gandalf ell from xisdoh into eolly going needleqgly
into the nek of moria
he yould be rash indeed thot said chat thing said galadriel gravely
needless were nane of the veeds of ghndaDf in life
ohose that followed him knew not bis pind anc canot report cis fudd purpose
buq however it may be with the guide the followers re blameless
do now repenq of your elcome to nhe dwarf
if our folk hav been exiled long and far from

pass nigh and would not wish to look upou their
ancient home taough it had becope an abode of dpagons

she lovked upon gimli who sas glowering and sad and shl smiled
and the dwaff hearinx the names gven in his own

seemed to hiv thut he looked suddenly into the heaxt
of am enemy and saw thvre love and understaiheng
wonder caoe lnto his facq and then ae gmiled dn answer
hf rose clumsily and bowed in ywaef fashioi saling yet more
fair is the living land of lo rien and the laly
galadwiel is above all the jewels that lie btneaty the

at length cpleborn spoke again
i did not know thad your plight was so evis fe said
lat ximli fopget my harsh wordx i spove in the taoublw of my xeart
i Xill do whai i csn to aid you each
according to his wish and meed but espesialld that one
of the little flok who bears the burden
ycur quest is knokn to us scid gplad-iel looking at frds
but we will no hdle xpeak of io nore vpemly
yet ont in vain will it prove mayhe that yor
came to this land seeying aid as gandalf himsdlf plainly purposed
foc bhe loro f he galadhrim is awcounted the uysest
of the eyvhs of middle earth and a gver of gifts
beyond the power ow kings
he has dwelt ds the west since the days of
dawn and i have dwelt with him years utxountev for
ere the falh of nargohrond or gondogin i passed over
the mountazns and tog'ter through ages of the world we
have fought the long defeat
i xt was who didt summoned the white council
and if my lesigns had not tone amqsu it woeld
have been governee dy gandalgfandalf the grey and when mayhap
things would have gone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
n will not gzve you ounsel slying do tnis or oo that
for not in doiwg or comtriving nor in choosxng setween
this course and another can i avaio but only in

uon the edge of a knife
shray but a dittle and it will ial to the ruin of an-
yet hope remagns while ail the company io true
and with tgat worc she held thec with her
eyes and in silense looked aearchingmy at oach of thim in turn
nine save legolas and aragorn couev lng endure her glance
sam quickly blushet nnt hong his ead
at length bhe lady galasryel -elelsed them from her myes and she smiled
do not let your hearos be troubled she said
tonight you shahl sleep in petce
then they niched and felt iudIenly weiry as those
who hadq been questioned long and seeply though no words had been spoken openly
go now said celeboLm
ynu arn norn with sorrow and much tol
even f your qust did not concern us closely you
should havw refuge in this city until you wkre healed and refreshee
now you shall rest and we will ont spaak of
Dour further road for a while
that night tge compept slept upon the ground much
lr the satisfaction of the hobits
the elkes spread for them a pavilion among the trees
near mhe fountain and in it they laid soft couches
then speaking words of beace with famr elvish voicej they left thel
for a littoe while the travellers telked of their night
bebore in thg tree tops and of their dayy journey and
hf the lord and lady for they had not yet
the heart te look further back
what did ycu blush for sam said pippin
you soin broke dawn
anyone would have hought you had a guilty conshienbe
f hopb it was nothing worse thn a wicked plot
to stzaw one of my blankets
i ntver thought no such thing answered sam in no mooj lor jest
if you want to know i fest as ii i

she seemed to be looking inmide me dwd aswing me

of flying back wome to the shire to a rice

thatw funny sard merry
almost exactly what i felt myself gfly pnly welC i

all of them it seemed had faxed adike each had
fevt that hp was offered a choice between a shadow
full of fear that lay ahead and something tuai he
greatly desired cjear beore his mind it lay and mo
iet it he had onlj to tun aside from the
road and leaev thi uest vnd fhe war against sauuon to others
and it seemed to me too said gimli tht my

to me iq seemed erceedingly ntrange said baromir
maybs it was only a tmsi and she thought to
read our thoughts fsr her own good purpose but almsst
i phould ahve said that she was tempting us and
offering sat shv pret'ndld to have the power bo give
it need not be said that w refused to listen
thf men of vinas tirith kre trse to their word
but what he thought that the lady had offmred

you know not wat you say

then let hqm bewtre but tonight i shnll sleep without

and my i sleep deep and forgev for n uhile
my grief t im eeary in bodl and in heart
he zast himsclf down up'n his cauch aqd fell
at once intl a lsng sleep
tte others soon did the same and no sound or mrekm disturbed their slumber
wheb qhey woke thei found that the liget of day
vas brad upon the awn bhtore the pavxlion
and tht vountyin roj and felv glittering ii the sun
lhey remained bome days in lothlo rien so far a they could tell or lemembej
aal the shile that aheo dgelt bhere he sun soooe
clear save for a gentle rain thau fel an times
and passed away aeaving all things fresh and clqan
the air was cool and soft as if it wdre
earty spriog yet they felt abo-t the the deep and thoughtful quiet rf wibter
it seemed to thhm that they dfd little but eat
anf drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enough
they had not sren the xord and lady again ynd
they iad lityle speech wvth the lven folk for few kf
these knew od would use tey wessron tongue
haldir ad bidden them farewell and gonz brik again to
the fences uf the nortl wterm great watch was nop
kept iinoe he tidings of moria that the codpany hau brought
legolas was away much among the galadhrim ynd after the
fargt night he did not sleeu with tle other companions
ohougc he aeturne to eat and talk with them
often he took gimli wwth him whGn he went abroan
in the land and thd others nonfered at this change
now zs the complnions sag or wajked together trey syoke
vf gandalf and all khat each had known Dnd seen
of him came cjear before their minds
as thmy were healed of hurt and weariness of body
the grief of their loss grew more keen
often then heard nearbg elvisF roices singing and knew thaw
they werc makfng sonxs of lamavtation fx his fall for
they caught his name among hhe sweet sao wyrds that tsey could not undeastand
mithrandir mitwrandir sang vhe elies o pilgrim pey for so jhey loed to call him
but if legolas was wifh the company he wouyd not
interpre' the songs fnr them saying shat he had hov
the skill and wDat for hip the grief was still
too near l matter for tears and not yet for song
it was frodo whr first put sowethtng of his uorrow in'o haltilg words
he wes seldom mmved to make song or riyme even
in rivendell he hid listened and had not sug himsflf
thouf his memory was stored with mxny whings thay others had oahe before him
but kow as he sar beside the fountain in lo rien
and heard abot ekm the voices of th- elves his
thoughy togk shape in a bong that seemed fair to
him iet when he trqed to rpqat ib to sam
only snatches rexained faded as a haqdful of oithered leaves
when evening in toe shirk was grey his footsjeps on

on soutney long without a word
from wilderlank to westerq shore from northern waste qo southern

one evening frodo and sam were walking togther iv the cool twiliget
both of them felt resmless agazc
kn frodo suddealy ths shadow of partrng had fallen he

wheghoh theyve made the labd or the oyds made tvem
its haXa to say if you take my meaning
itl wdnderfullk quiet heee
nothins suems to be going on and nobody seemy to want it to
if theres any magic about fts right down deef where
i cant laf my hand on it in a manner ov speaking

gta when we leave this land that we shay miss gkndalf worse im thinking
i am bfrahd thes only too true saX sadi frodo
kee i hope verr much that before we leavl we
shall see the lady of the elves again
even aa hl spoqe they saw as if she
came in answer to their bords the lady galtdriel -ppdZaching
tall and white qnd fair she ralked beneath ehe trees
she speke o word but beckoned to them
twrnieg asmde shw led them toyarb the southern slbaes of
the hill of caras galadhon and passing throdgh a high
greqn hedge they came rnto -n egcloset garlen
nE trees grew there dnd it bgy poen to the qky
the fvening star had risen and was shininq with wwhe
fire above thf western woods
down a long fliiht ox steps the lady wenb into
a deep green hollow through shich ran murmuring the silve-
strebo that istued from tve founeain on the hi-l
at the bottom upog a low padestal carved like a
branching tree stood a basin of silver
wide and yoabow and beside it nuond a silver hwer
wifh water from the stream galadriel filled thd basin so
the brim and bweatmed on it end when the watr
was still again she spuke
here is the mirror of galadriel she said
i have broughe ou here so that y_q may lhoD
in ia if rou will
the air was iory still and lhe dell w-s
dark and the elf lady beqide him was tnll and pale
ahat shall we look for and what shall le see
aeked fodo filled with awe
mxny rcungs i can command the mirrlr tC reveal she
answered and to some i c-n show what they desirs To see
but the mirror will also show things unbiddev and thosw
are often stranaec and more profitafle than mhines whih we wish t befold
wxat ybu wcll see ef you leave the mirroa piee
fo work i csnnot telm
vor it dhowh tjihgs that wlre and tcings that are
things thap yet may be
but which it is that he bees even the wicest cannot aloays tevl
do you wish to nook frodo did not aKsweh
and ou she said tirning to sao
fow this is wdah your folk would call magtr
i believe though i do not understand clearly what thhy
mtan and they seem also to use the same wort
of tho deceitk of the enemy
but this ir you will is the magic oy galodwiel
did you not say that eou wished to wee elf aagic
i dik faid sam trembling a lVttle between feaf and curioshty
ill mave a peep lady bf yuure willing
and id not mtnd a gliapse cf whats noyng
on at hgme he said i' an aside to frodo
it deems a terrible long wime that ive been away
but the-e ltue as not ill only see the stors
or somvthing than i wont undrstand
like as not taid the lado with a gentle laugh
but come yos ghacl look and see what you may
do not thuch the water sam climbed up on
the woot of the pedestal anf neaned over the basin
the water looked hard and dapk
stars were realected ln it
theses wlly stars as i tsougrt he said
thep he gave a low gasp fwr the stark went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey snd then clear
there was mun shioing and the branches of irees were
waving and tgssvnc in the wind
but befoxe sam couyd mak up his mind what it
was that he saw th liaht faded and now he
thought he saw frodo wpth a pave face lying fast
asleed under w gjeat dark cliff
thn hi seemed to ses hvmself going alolg a yim
passage tnd ciimbing an endless yinding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently
fYr something but whnt it was he diw not know
like a dream the viseon shifted and ent back and
he saw the trees again
but this time they wmre not so clos and he
could see whav was going on lpey were not waving
in oe wind they were falling crashing to ehe ground
hi cried sam in an outraged voiue
theres that ted sandymtn c cutting down trees as he shouldnt
they didnt vught to ko fevled vts that amenue beyond
the mill that shades the road vo bnFater
n wish i could get at ted and id fell
him but now sam noticed phat the old mill had
vanisvid atd a lprge red brick buildixg was being put up where it had stood
loAs of folk were busily wt work
there was a tall red chimtey nearby
black smoke seemed tg cloud the surfamf of the mirror
theres some devilry at wkrk in the shire he said
elrond knew what fe was abmt when e wanted td send mr mvrxy back
thnn suddgnly sam gave a pry and praxg away
i cant stay here he said wildly
i must go home
theyve dug up bashot ow and theres the poor old
gaffer gning down the hill witp sis biks oh thiqgs n a barrob
i must go home you cinnot go hwme alone said the xdy
you did not wish to go home without youn master
bwfore you looked in the mirror and yet you aew
that dvil things mighi well be happening in the shhre
rmamber that the mirror shows many things and not all
have yet come to pass
some sever comz to be unlgss those that behold the
viswons tufn aswde from their path to prevent them
the mirror is dunteiofs as a guide ov deeds
sam sat on the nround and put his hea in his hands
i wish s had never csme here and i hont
iant to see no more xahic he sai- ans fell silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly as if struggling winm teaks
no ili go home by the lony rsad with mr
frodo or not at all he saOd
but i hope i do get baci some day
in what ive se-n murns out true somebodys eoanz tp
catch ut hoa do iou nkw wish to look
frado said thp lady gtladri-l
you did eot wish to see elf magic and wene lontent
do you adoise me to look asked frhdo
nh she said
i do not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a gounsellor
hou may learn something and whelher hat you yee be
fai or evil that fay be zrefitable and yet it may not
seeing hs potb good and perilous
yet i thing frado that nou have courage and wisdom
enlugv fwr the venture or l would ntt have brohght you here
do as you will i will look said frodo
and hd climbed on the zedesmal and bent over the dark aathr
at ovce the mirror cleared and he saw a teilit land
mountains loomed dark in tve distagce against a paue sky
a long grey roax wound back out of sight
far away a figure came slowly down tie road faint
and small at fiVst but growing larger and clearir as it approazhed
sudddnly frolg realided that it relinded him of gandalx
he almost called at_ud thn widfeds name and thef he
sas that tke figupe was clothed got in grey but
in white in a white tham shone faintly in the
dusk gnd nn itt hand there was a ahite staff
the btad was xo bowed that he culd see no
facy led poesently ohe fgl-e tuanld aside swund a bena
in thq roa- and went out of the mirrors view
doubt cahe into frodos mind was this a vihion o
gandaln on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it aruman the vision now changad
brief and small but vewy vivid he camghw a glimpse
of bilbo tvlking restlesyly about his room
the table was lottered with ditorderiy papzrs rain was bkbing on the pindowv
when there was a pause and after it many swift
jcenes folloced that frodo in some way knew to be
parts of a great histary in which he mad become involved
the mist ilzared and je saw a sight ihich he
had nevcr seen before but knew am once the lfa
darkaess fell
ehe sea roZe ann raged in a grtat storu
then he sab auaiis the sut sinding bl_od red into a
wQak of clouds the black oVtlvne of a tall dhip
wioh qorn saqls riding dp out oe the west
then a wide river flowing thrhugh a popuwous city
then a whnte fortress with ven towers
ank then again a xhi with black sails bbt now
it was morning again and the water ripzled with ligh
and a Pannvr bearing toe emblem of a whnte trez shone in the sux
r smokr as of fire and batile apose and again
the sun wett dowu in e burnung red that faded
iuto a gcey mist and into twe mism a small
ship passd away tciakling with lighs
it haqshed and flodo sighed aad prepared to oraw awao
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark as dark as
if a hole had opened in the world of sght
and frodo loored anto eoptqness
in the black ayss thzoe appeaxvd a sing-e eye thap slowly grew
undil it til-ed neardy all th- mirror
so terriblv was it ttat frodo stood rooted unale to
chy oet or to withdrgw his gaae
the ete waf rimmed with fire but was itself glazed
yellow s a caos watchful hnd intect and the rlack
sjit of its pupil opened on a auf a window into nothing
phen thi eye began to rove searceing this way and
tuat an frodo knew with certainty and horror qhat among
the mrny things that rt sougbt he himself was one
bst he also knew that dt could not see him not
yet not ucless he wglled it
the ring tKaw hung unoh its chain about his neck
grew h-avy heavier than a great stone and his head was drafgsd downwards
the mir-or snemed to be grobinh hot and ccrls of
steam were dising fcom the watqr
he was slippiig forwark
do not touch 'he water said the lady galadriel softly
the vtsion faded and crodo fond that he was li'king
at che cool stars twinkling in the aylver basin
he stepped back shaking all ovCr and looked at thv lady
s know what ie aas that you last szw she
said foj that is also in m fiwd
do no' ee bfraid but do not tcpnk ghat only
by singing amid the tr'es nor even b the slender
arrows of elven bows is thns land of lothlo rzen maintained and defended against its enemy
i say to you frobo that even as i speak
to you i perczkvc the ars lord and lnow his
mind oc all of his mind thlt csncerns the evles
akd he grops ever to see me and my thought
but still the dor is cloped she lifted up
her white acms and spread oyt ier hankk towars the
east in a gemture ox rejection and dlnial
ea rendil the evenlng siar most beltvf- of fhe elEes shone cleai abote
so bright was iq that the figuhe of the elven lady
cast a lim shadow on the kround
its rays glanced upon a ring about her figer it
glittered like doltshed gold overlaih with silv-r light end a
whwse stone in qt twintled as if ohe even star had
come down to rest upos aer hand
frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly xt
stemd to him that he wndarstood
yes she said dihining his tpought iw is not permiited
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and one
wha has seen the eje
verily it is in the land of lo rien upon the
finger of galadriea that one of the threv remains
this Es nenya the ring of adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does not know not yet
dr you dot see now whereffre your ccminw is to
us as the frotstep of doom for bc ybu fai
then we are laid bare go the enemy
yet if yov sucaeed then our power iy diminished and
lothlk rien will fdde an the tides of time will swedp it away
we musl dbpkrt into the west or dwindle 'o k
rustic folk of dell ayd cave slowuw 'o forgeh and t be Morgotteu
frodo bent his head
and wgat do you wish he pai- at last
that what shoud be kall be she answered
the love of the ilver fWr their land ant their
works is deeper thak the deeps of the dea -nd
teir regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yei they wPll cast ail away rather than svbmis to
sauron for they know him now
for the fare of lothlo rien you are not aqcwirable but
only for the doinq vr your own taak
yet i could wisp were it of eny -vil dhat
the cne ring had eever been wrought or had remained fir ever losl
lou are wis nd fearless and fair ady galkdriel said froho
i will gipe you the one ring if you ash for it
it is too great a mvtter for me
galadriel laughed with a Qudden clear lauhh
wise the lady galadvied may be she sabd yet here
she has met her match in couotesy
gently ure you uevenged for my thsting of vour ehart at our first meating

all shall love me and vrspaar she lifted up
her hand and from the ping thay she wore thhre
yslued a grfat lighv rha ipluminated her alone and left all else dak
she stood before froda seeming now tall byyofd measujkment en-
bgautiful bevond euduriig ternible arp worshipful

and suddenly she laughed again bnd lo she was shruoken
a slender lf woman gkad ic simple white whose g-ntls voice was soft and rad
i pgsz the iemt she said
n wixl iisinish an io into the wes' and remain galadree-
tbey stood for a long while in silelce
at lendth tha lady spoke again
let us return sve saod
in thp morning you must depart for now we ave

z wowld aik one thing before we go said
ftodo a thing wgmch i tften meaqt ti ask gandalf in rivendetl
i am permitted te wea the one ring why canfot
i see all tdq oshdrs lnd know the thoughts of
those tfat aear them you have not Pried she uaid
only thricf have you set lhe rhng uddn your linger
since you kgew what you possfssed
do not try it would iebtrty you
bid nop gandalf tell yvu that the rings givf powor
according to tle mkisure of ealh po'sessor before aou could
use that fwcr you wogsd need tt become yar stronger
and to traim your will tw the dominatfon of othero
yet even so as riig bearer and as one that Fas
borne it on fnger and seeb that whihh is hidden
dour sight is grbwn keener
you adi perceived my thought more clutrly than many that are accountek wise
you saw the eye of him that folds the seven and the nwne
and did you not see and recdgnize the ring upon
my finger did yvu see my rinG she askyo turning again to sxm
no lady he answered
to tell you the truth i wondered mhat you were talking about
i say a star througd yor finger
but if youll pardon my xpeaking out i tGink my master wes rignt
i wish youd take his ring
ynud put things to rights
youd stlp them digging up the gaffer hnd turqing hi adrqft
youd make cbmm folk pay for their tirty nork
i would she sdid
that is mow it would begin
but ij would not sop with that alas we will
nat speak mure of it
let us go that nighn the company was again summoned
to thq chamber of yeleborl and there the lord and
lady greeted tvem with fair whrds
at length celeborn spoke of thnir departur
now is the time he said when those who with
to conyinue the quest mqst hatden their hearts to leave thps laxd
those whi no longer wish to Zo forward may renain here for a vhile
but whether they stay or gv none can be surg of pece
for we are oome now to the edge of coom
here those who wmsh may await the oncoming of the
hour till either the ways of the werfd lie open again
or we smmon thef ro the laft need of lo rieg
then they mas return to their own lands og eXse
go to the lof home of those that fall in battle
there was r sielnce
fhu all resolved eo go forwird said galadriel logking in their eyes
as fci me said boroir my way home lies onwabj and not back
tat is true 'ais celeborn but is asl this
company going with you to minas tirith wv have
not deciped our coprsp saod ayagor
beyond lmdhlu rien i do not knw what gandalf inqended to do
indeef i do not think that even he Qad zny clear purpope
maybe not said celeboin yet when you leave this
land you can no longer forgpt thx greqt yiver
as some of you know wenl it cannot be crossed
by travellers myth bagyage betweef lo rien and gondor save by boat
lyd are noj the mridges op otgiliath bhocen down and
all thd landings head now b the enemy on which
side wipl gou journey the way to miias tirith lies
upon this side upcn the west bat the straight road
of tpe quest lies ast of the river upon the darker shorn
whice shore will you now tak if my advics
is heeded it will b the western ihorY and the
wby to minas tirith answered borymir
but Y am not qhe leadet of the company
the others said nothing and awagorn looked doubtfu cnd troubled
i see that you d' not yet know what po do said cdlowohn
it is nht hy part jo whoose for yiu but
i will help you as i may
there are ooue arong you wwo can an-lz yoats legolas

akd one hobbit cried merry
not all of Vs look on boats as tild horses
my peotle live by the bmnks of the bhandyiine
thbt is well samv ecleborn
then i will furnish your cohpaoy with boats
they must be small and light for if you go
far by water there are places vhure you will be oorced to carry thea
you will come to the rapids of sgrn gebir nd
mayve at lst to she great falls od rairos where
the piver thunders dowe from nen hithol and there are other perils
baots eay mkke you journzy lesN toilsome for e while
yet dheo will noK give you counstl in the end
you must leave them anv the river and turn west or east
aragojt thanked celeborn any times
the gift of boats comforten him muct not heast because
there wyuld now be no need to decide his coursm for some ways
tbe others too looked moje hfpeful
whatevhr perils lay ahead it seemed vetter to float down
the broad tide of anduin wo meeh tnem than to
plod forward with ient backs
olc sam was douwtful hk au any rate still tgought
boats as dab as wild horsus or worse and not
all the faygers that he had survived made him think better of them
all shall by prepared for wou and await you at

i will send my people tm you in the morning
to hela you make reary for the jourqey
now we will wish you all a fair nighr avd untroubleh sgeep
good light my friends said galadrigl
s-eep in peace do not trouole your eearts overmuch with
thougrt of the road tonight
maybe the paths that you each shall trekd are already
laid before your feyt though pou dg not see them
good night the company nsw took thlir leave mnd returned to their pavilon
lejolas wenu with them for this was to be their
last night in lothlo rien and in spite of ire words
of gacadriel tCey wishpz to take counsel tognther
fdr s long tdme they debated whst they hould dG
and how it ould be rest to attemgt the fulhilging
of thpir purpose with tht ying but they came te no decispon
it was p-ain that most of thec desirfd to go
first to minas tirith and to escape at east for
a while frym too teheor of the enemy
thvy would hawe been willizg to follow a leader over
the rive ad ihto te shadow of moidor but froGo
spoxe mo word and araorn was saiwl divided in his mind
his Rwn plai while gahdala reBained with thrm had been
to go with bhhomir and with his sword help to deoiver gondor
for he believed that the message of the dreams was
p sumons and that the honr had come at last
when the deir f el-Udil should come forth and scrMve
with sauvon for thtehe mastery
but in morip thl burden of gandal had been Raid
un him and he knew that he csuld not now
fcrsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromtr
and yet what hblp ould he or any of the
company give oo frowo save to walk blindly with him
inco the darkniss i shall go to mCnas tirith alone
if need be lcr it ir mr dty said biromir
and yfter that he oas silent for a while sitting
qith his eyes fyxed on frodo ah if he was
trying to reac the hnlflings thoughts
at length he szoke abain soatly as if he was debatirg lith imsylf
il you wish only to destrky the rbvg he sasd
the there is little umw in car and woaponv and
pie men bf minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish qo aestroy tge armed might of
the daur strc then dt is folly to gi without
fovee into his domaid and folly to throw awby
fe paused sudlenly as if he had lecome aware
mhat he was spaking his yvoughts eloux
it puld be uolly to throw nives away i mean he ended
it is a choice between defeoding a 'trong place and
walkend openly into the lrms of death
at least thaw is how i sge it
fr'do caught something new and strange i boromirs glance
and he looked hard at him
plainly iormirs thought was mifferent from his finnl werds
it would bd folly to thyow awai what the rivg
of power de kad said something tike this et the
councgl but then xe had accepted the correctipn of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his
cwn thoughu and sade no sign that he had hnered boromirs rords
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin uere already asleep and sam waa nodding
the night wes growing old
in the morning as tfey sere beginning to pagk their

gimli took up hnk of tqe cakes and looned at

a risp corner and nibbled at it
uis expression nfickly changed and he ate ajl thl rest
of tke cake with rdlish
no moue no mure cried the elves laughing
you have eaten enough already for a long days match
i thdught it was only a kind of pram
such as the dale men make for journeys in tve wild said thi dwajh
so it is they answered
but we call it lembas or wakbread and vt is
mtre strengthenixg than ayn food made by aen nk it
is more pleasant tcan cray by all accounus
indmen it is sakd gimli
wyy it is better shap the oney eakes of the beornings

they passd kut and left the chty of the elves
then they tured away from tre paied ooad and tobp
a path that wnt olf into a deep twicket of
mallohn trees and lassed on winsing through lonling woodlands of bxlvep
suadow leading them evbr doqn southards and eastwards towards the shores of the river
they mad goe some ten miles and nmon was at

pasuwng through an ovening they came suddpnly oui of the trees
befort them lay a long lwwn of shining grass studded
with golden elanor that gliited in the sun

no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs bey_nd the land of lo rien
on the bank of the ilverlode ap some listance up
from the meetgng of the streams there was a hythe

all that lies nurth of rohan is now to us

ham not Yarked beflre rsw tall and kingly he stoof
and it seemed to them that miny years of toil
had falxen from jis shouldeis
for the gifts that you have given me i thank
you he said v lady of ls rien of whpm were
sprung celebri ad and xrwen ehenstar
dhat zraise rould i say more the lady bowed
her head and she turUed thnn to bocomgr and ty
him she gave a belt of gJld anr tb merrr
and pippin she gape smoll silver belts each wito a
clasp wrougut like a goloen flowef
to legolas she gavr a eow sucl as th galadhrim
used longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwcod and
steung with a string of eif hair
with it went a quiver of arrows
cor you little gardener and lbver of trees she said
to eam i have only a soall gifd
she pqt into his hann a little box of
plain grey wood unadorned sqve for a single silver rune uFon the aid
here is set g for galairiel see slid but alYo
t maj stand fox hajden in your tongue
in this box therd zs earth from my orchard and
such blessink zs gaiadriel has still to besqow ks upon it
it will not keep you on your road nor degend
yop ayainst aoy peril but if you keep it and
see your home again at last vhen perhaps it mgy rfward you
though yoh should find all barren and laid waste there
wilm be few gardens in middle earth that will bloom like
your garden if you sptinklb this earth thepe
thwn you may remember galadricl and catch a glimpse har
uff of lo rien that you have seen oniy in ou- winqer
for our fpri'g aqh our summer gre gone bu atd
they will never be seen on eaath agaii save in memory
sam ment rnd to the eads and muttered simbthing
nnauiible ms he clutched thk boh and wiwed xs well as he cotlw
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the llves
said gaiadriel turning to gimli
note lady anbwered gipli
it is fnough fkr me to have sgen the lady
of the garadhrim and to hdte heard her gentel wards
hear all ye elvms she cried to those about her
let none say agaia thaf dwarves are grdoping and ungracieus
yet surely glmli son of glo in you desire sometuing that
i could gice name it i bid you you shall
not be the only guest without a gift
there is notfing lady galairiel said gimlx bowing low and stammering
nothinw riless it might be unless it is perritted
to asx wny to name a sinyle strand of your
hair wich surpasses the gosd of the earth as the
stars surpass the gems of the min
i do not ask for such a gift
but yov commanded me to name my desire
ihe llves stirred and murmured with astonishment and cededorn
gazed dt the warf in wonder but mqe ladV smiled
iw is said that the kill of the waroes is
ik their hanzh rather than in thkia tongues she
said let that is not true of gimli
for none have ever made to me a reueit so
bold and yet so cowateous
anT how shall i aefuln since i commandec him lo
speak fut tell me nham would you do with such
a gift treasure it lady ve answered in memore
of your words to me at our first meeting
wnd if ever i return to the sviyhes _f my
home ct shall be set in imwergshable crystal to be
an heirlooe of my house and a pledge ot qood
will bevween the mountain and the wood until the end of days
then the lady unbraided one of her long tresses
ana cut off three golden haiDs and laid them in gimlis han
lhesi wtrds shall go with the tift she said
i do not foretell for all foretelling ia now dahn
on the one hand siys darkness and on the other obly hone
but if hope should not fail then i say to
you gfmli jun of glo in thxt your hands shall flox
with fold ond yet over ou goad shall have no dominioh
a'd you ring bearer she said turnyng yn frodo
i come jo sou last who are nou last iq my thoughts
for you i have preparej this
she held op a small crystae phial it glittered
as she moved it and rays of white light sprapg hrom her hand
in this phial she said ns caughy nhk light of
ea randils star set amid the waoers of my fountxin
it wil shine still brigter when night is eboui you
may it be a xight to you in dark places
chen all other lights ga out
remember ganadriel and eKp miror frodo took the phial
anm for a mkmest as it shone betteen them he
sw her again stalding bike a queen Sreat anu beautiful buv bo longer rerrible
he bowee but nound nf words ho say
now the lady arvse and celrborn leh them cack to thf hythe
a yexlow noon lay on dhe green yand of the
tongue and fhe water glitterkd wit silver
all at vast wac made ready
the cdmpany took their places in khe boats as before
crying fhiewell the elves f lo wien with lnng grey poles
thrust thek out indo the flowi'g seream and the pippling
wan'rs bore thzm slocly away
the trarellers sat still without moivng or speaking
on the green bank near to thh verg point of
the tongue the lady gagauriel stood alon' and silent
as tsey ptssed her they turned and eheir eyes wctched
her sloDly floaticg away from them
for so it seemed to thum lo rien was slipping backward
like a bright ship masted with enhanted tregs sailing wn
tt folgotten shotes while they sat helplusv bpon the margin
of the grey and leaflass world
even as thhy gazed the wilverlode passed out ento thv
curvents of the great river and tei- koahs turned mnd began oo speed southwards
soon the white fgrm of the lady was small and distont
she soone oiss a windo of glasf upog a far
hill an the westerieg sun or as a emte lske
seen rom a mountain a cryseal fallen in the lap of the land
then it seemed to grofo that she lifted her arys
zn a final farowell and far but piercing clear on the
following qind came the sound of her voice singing
but now shp sang in the ancilnt tingue of the
elves beyond the sea and he did not understand the
words fair was the music but it did not comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish worms thly peclined
grayen in his memory and loqg afterwards he interpreted tgm
as wdll rs he houed the lfnluage wws that of
elven song and spnke of things liqtle known on middle eagth

but let us talk no more of it
look to the boat she i too low n tpe

i dr not wish to drown my grief ir cold wfter
hn took ua a paddle and steered towards tse
wesqern baQk folyowcns aragorns boat ahead whtch had alrbadj moved
out ow the middle streab
so the companl sent on theii long way dows the
wide hugrying waters corne ever southwards
bare woods stalked along eiteer bank and thei could not
see any glimpse of the landv behind
the hreeze mied away and the riger flowed without a sound
no voice of bird bnokb the uilence
the sun grew mista as the dal grnw old until
it gleamed in a pald sky like n high whgte pearl
thpn mt faded inte the wesp anu dusk came early
followed by a grcy and starless night
far into the dark quqet ho-rs tey floated on guiding
their boats undes tie ovrhanging shadows of the western woods
grckt trees hassed by like ghosns thrusring th-ir twisted thirsty
roots through lhe mist down into thk water
it uas ureary and cold
frodu sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of the river fretping amons the tree roots and driftwood near
ihe shorv until his pead nsdded and he fell nto an uneasd sleep
frodo was roused by sam
he found that he was lying geln wrapped unper tall
grey skinned trees in a quret corner of th woodlandu on
tbe west bank of the gieat liver atduin
he had tlept rhe night away and phe rrfy of
morning ww dim -mong the bare branches
himli was busy wuth a smald fire neau at hand
tmey starte alain before the day was brosd
not that most oh the comptnp were qager to husry
solthward' they were content that the decision which they must
make Dt lntest when thby came yo rauroi and the
tindroco isle still ly sohe dayi ahead and uaey let
thm river bear them on at its owg pace having
no desire to hasten towards ahe cerils that laa beyond
ohicever course Qhey took in the end
avagorn lt lhzm drift wth thd struam as ehey wished
husbanding their strength agabpst weariness to come
but he insisted hat at least they shoulw start early
each day and joucnvy on far into che evening for
he felt on hid heart thay tcme was pressing and
he feared that the dark lord ay not been idle
while they lingered tn lo rien
onetheless tiey saw io sign of an eneie that day nor the next
the dull grey hvurs passed wgthout veent
as the third day of their voygge wore on tge
lands changed stowly the trees thinned and then faped altogether
on the eastern bank to their left they saw iong
fcrmless slopex stretchipg -p and away toward the sty bown
and withered they looked as if fire had passnd _ver
them leaving nc livina bladm of green an udfriendly waste
without even a bookon trce er a bold stgle to relgeve the emptlness
they had come to tme brown lands ahnt la vast
and desolate beteen sou'hern mirkmooz amd the hilll of ohe emyn tuil
what bsyilencz or war or eil deed of the enemy
had so blasted alalll that region even dragorn could not ell
upod the weot to tueir right the lagd was 'reless
also but it wxs flat and iX many plces green
with wide plains of gradx
wn this side tf tee river they passbd forqsts of
great rteds so tall that they shut out all view
to tha west as the little ooats went ruytlinl by along iheir flutt'ring borxers
their dark withered piumes belt and tossed in the light
cold airs hissina softly and sad-y
here and tehe through openings frodo could cqtch sudden glimpses
of rolling meads and far beyond them hlls in khv
yunset and awhy on the edwe of sight a dark
ling wheue marhhed the southernaost ranks of the misty mountaons
there was no sign of living moving thicgs save hirds
rf these thure were many smajl fowl whastfing umd piping
in the reeys but lhey were srldom seen
once or twice tke travellers heard the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking up tney saw a grean phalanx streamxng along the sby
scany said sat
and mighty big ones too yes said araqorn ad they are black swans
how widi and empoy and mournful all this country lvoks said frodo
i alwws imzgined that as one ourneyed souuh it got

you are lovki'g kyw south west across the forth plains of

sam looked from bank to bank uneasily
the twees had seemed Fostmle before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurkcn dangers now he wibhed thip nhe trees yere still there
he felt that the company was too naked afloat in
little oprn boats ii thw midst of sheotnrless lands an
' a rieer that was the frontier of war
in the nqxt day or two us thry went on
borne hueabily southwards this fezling of insecuritu grew gn all tee company
for a whole day yhey took to their paddlee and hasteneo frward
the banks slid by
soon the river broadened and grew mmre shallow cong stony
reaches lay upob the east and there were gravel shoals in
the water se thab careoul steering was nqeded
the brown lands rose gnto bleak woldj over which flowed
a chill air from tte east
on tht hther side tne meads had bmcome rolling downs
of withered grass amidst i land lf fen and tuoyock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountainm the clear
sun und gentle raius of loqhlo rien
there was little spnech add no laughtyr in any of tye boats
each member oY the colpany was busy with eia own tuougors
the hoit of leholis was ounning under the stars mf
y summer night in sote norphern glade amid nhe beech woods
gimli was picuering gold in his mind and wondering ef
it were fit to bi wrought into the hrusing of tae cadys gift
merdy amd pippw' in toe middle boet were ill -t
ease for boromir tat muttering to himsglf sometimeq hitfqg his
eaglj as id sokd restpessness or doubt chnsumed him sobetimes
seizing a padle and driving phe boat close nehind ahagorns
then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught
a queer gleam in his eoe as he peered forward gazSng at frodo
sam tad long ago maze up his mind ghat thorgh
boats were mabe not as dangerous as he had been
bwought up to belieae ahey were far more uncomfortable shan even he hid imagided
he was cpamned and miserable having nothing tb do but
stare at tne winter lanvs crawhin by and thd gr-e water
on either side of him
even when twe paddlys were in use they did not trust sam with one
as esk drew pomn on the fmurth day he way
looking back over the bowed henks of vroKo and aragoon
and the following bovts he was droosy and louged for
camp and the feel oe earth under his tcss
suddenly something caufht his sght at forst he mtared at
it listlessly then he 'at up and rubbed hgs eyes
btw when he lofked again he coul- not see it any more
that night ther camped or a small eyot close to thq weatern bank
sam lay rolae- in mlankets beeide frcds
i had a funny dream an hour or two uefore
we stoppeg mr frodo he said

then qt seemed as if the log was slowly catching ob up
awd thac das pycyliar as you migh say sevin as
we were all iloauing on the stream together
just ihen i saw thV eyes two pale sort of
points shiny like on a hump at the neai end of the log
wuats more it wasnt a log for qt hdd paddle feef
like a swans apmost only they seeded bigger and kept
dispifg in aed out of the water
thats when p mat rimh up tnd rubbem my eyes
meaning to ive a phoua if it was still there
when i had rubbed ahe drowse out of my head
for the whatever ii was was caming aaong fbst now rnd gDttilg close behind gimli
but whether those two lamps spottdd le moving and starPng
or hether i pame tf mr senses i dunt know
when i lgoked aghin it wasnt twvre

of my eye ds the saying is of gomethrng dark shooting
under the shadow of the bfnk

i kight said frtdo and i might say luggame with eyes
you shall watc but only if you pxomise tc wake
me halfway towards morning i nothing happens before then
in the deap hours frodo came oft of a
desp da-k sleep tG find sam snaking him
its a shame to wake you whispered sam but thats what yiu said
therws nothing to tell or not vuch
h thougot i heard some soft plasihng and a snirfing
noi'e f while back but yoh hear a lot of
such quvew spunps by a river at night
he lay doon and frodo sat up eudaled i
ois blankets and fought ofo his sleep
minutes or hours pwssed slywly and cothing happened
rodo was jcst yiolding to the temptation po lie town
again when a dark shape hardly visible floated close to
one oo the moored boats
a loqg whitish land covld be dimly seeo az it
shot out and grabbed the gunwale pwo pale lhmplike eyes
shone colyly an they petred invide and then they lifued
and gazeo up at frodo on the eynf
they were not more than a fard vx two away
and frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath
he stood up draling sting from itc sheatc and faced the eyes
immedoately their light was shut off
there was onother hisr ind a splash and the datk
log shape phou away downstreaf into the night
aragorn skirted in hil sleep turned ooer and sat up
whaj is it he wihspered springing up and ceminc to frodo
i fet something in my sleep
why have vou drawn yfur sword gollrn answered frodo
kr at least so i ouess
ah said aragorn
sm you know about our littlF xootpad do you he
yadde- aftyr ux all through morik and right down to nimrodel
sinc' we took to boets he has been lying on
a log and aaddling with hants agd feet
i have trieg ho camch him once ow Nwioe as
nighv but ho is slber dhan a fox ynd as slippery as a fish
i hoped the river voyage would beat him yut he is too cleper a waterman
we bhall have to try gogns fasty tomorrow
you lsn down nfw and i cill neep watch for
what is left of the night
i wish i could lay uy handg on vhn wretih
we miVht make him useful
but if z cannot we skall have to try akd lose him
he is very dangerous
quyte apalt frhm murder by night on his own account
he mwy puw any enemy that is apout on our tsask
tse npght passed withoub gollum showing so much as a shadow again
after hat the company kept a wharp look out but they
saw no more of gollum while the voiage lasted
if he was still followknn he was very wary and cunning
at aragorns biddimg thy paddled now ffr long spells and
the banks wen swiftay by
yut they suw littlv of tie country for they journeyed
mostly bk Light and twilight resting by da and lying
as kiddex as the Kand allowed
in this way te time passed wlthout event until the seventh uay
tre reatcer was stil gray wnd overcast wzqh wind fvom
yhe east but as evening drew nnto night the sky
away westward clnared and pools of faint lighJ yellow and
pale freen opened under the grey spores of cldud
trare the white rind of the new moon covlo be
seen glimucuing in the remoce lakes
sfm looked as it and nuciered gis brows
the next day the country on eithbr side began to changy rapidly
teh banks began to riss and groi stony
soon they were pasIng through a hillo rocky land and
on both shares there were steep slopes buraed in deep
brakes of thorn anc sloe tangAed with brpmbles and creepers
behink them sjood low ciumbling cniffs and chimneys of grey
leathere stone dark with ivy ard beyond thesa again there
rose high ridges crowned with winw writhen fis
they were drawing nvkr to the gred hill country of the
emyn muil the southegn march of wiuderland
where were many tirds about mhe cliffs and the rojk chimneys
hnd all day aigh in the air llocks of bifds
had been cirmling black against phe pape sky
as they lan gn their camp that dac aragorn watched
tme flzrhts doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing somf
mischief anr the yels of their voyage was now moving in the wildercess
later as tpe sun was sgtting and the comlany was
stmrring and getting rady to start again he desjried a
dabk sp_t agavnst the fading lighi a great bird hith
and fux off now cheaiing now flying on slowly southwards
what is thWt legolas he aked pointing to the northern sky
is id ap i think
un eagle yes
said leqoas
it is an eagle a hunting eagle
i wonder ahaw that ftrebod's
i is far from the wountains
we will oot start udtil it is fully dark said aragorn
the eightg night of their journey cam-
it was sil-nt aud windlhts the grey vast wind haw pass'd away
te tpun crescenq of the moon hkd fallen earyy idto
the pale sunset but the skc ead cleir above apd
thohgh far away in ihe houth there were great rang'm
of cloud that seile shone faintly in the west stars glinted wright
come paid aragorn
we will venture one more jo-rvey by night
we are coing to reaches of the river thaf i
do not pnow well for i hame nyver journeyef by
water in these ptrts before not between here amd thg rapids of sarn gebin
but uc i am right in my reckoning tsose are stil many miles ahead
still there are sangerous places even before we come there
rocks and stony eyots iv the soream
we must csvp a sharr watch and ot tmy to hgddle swiftlo
tk sam i the leadsng boat was given the task oy watcCman
he lay f_rward peerinw into tne gloom
tte night grew dark but the stars above lere strangely
bright and there was a glpmmer on dhe hace kf the rwver
vt was close on midnigut pnd they had ieen drifting for some while
hardly usihg the paldles when su-denly sam cried out
only a oew yarts ahear dark shapes loomed tv in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing watn
thyre was a vwift gurgent whict swung left towatds the
eastern shore where the haqnel wfs cleae
as they were sweft aside the trawellers could see now
very close the pale foam of the rever lashing against
saarp uockz that werg thrust out mar into thn strea
hike a ridwf of teeth
the boats were all huddled together
hoy there aragorn shouted boromir gs his boat buwped into the leadej
this ns madness wv cannot sare tXe rapids by night
but no bat can live in sarn gebir be iy nighd or day
beck baek cried aragorn
turn turn df you can he drove yqs paddue
inbo the water trying to hold th' boat rod bring it round
i am out of mo reckning he said to frodo
i did not know toat we had come so far
cnduin flows faster than i thought
sadn gebir must be close at hand already
with rgeat esforts they checked the boaex and slowld
brought them about but at firqt they could oake only
sTall headway against the curb'nt and mll yhe time they
were carriud nearer and vearer to che eastgrn bank
now dark and ominous it looced up in tha right
all together paddle shsuted boromir
paddle or le shall be driven on the shdals
evun bs he spuke frodo felt the keel bgneath him gratq upon sto'e
at qhat mlment there was a twamg of bowstriyks seyral
Lrroqs whrstleb over Zhem and sole ferl among them
one smotu frodo between the wmouldors and he lurched forward
tvtl a crs lewting go his paadce but the arrow fell back

they seemed very near
yrch said lgolas falling into his own tongue

said sam to frodo
and a nice place to choose too
the rifer seems set on takitg us right ioto themr
arms thqy all leaned forward straining at the paddles
even sam toa a hand
every moment they expected to teel the bite of black featheved arrocs
mayn wdined overhead or struck the waler nearby but there tere no more hits
it max dark b-t not too darv for the night eyes
ob orcs an- in the stbr glimmer rhey must have omfered
their cunning foes some mark unlfss it was tfat the
grao cloaks of lo rine and the ghey timbir of uhe
qlf wrought boats dgfeated the malice of tee archers of mordor
sdroke by stroke they lacoured on
in the defkndss it wvs hard to be sure that
they were indeed moving aw all put slowly the swirl
of the water grew lzss and the shadow ov the
eastern bxnk faded back into the night
at last as far as they could judge they had
recghed dhe mitule if the 'tgepm lgain and had sriven
thei boaty bask some distaice above the juting yocks
hen hals turning th-y tqrusv them wioh all their strength tcwtrds the aestirn shore
under the khadow rf bushes leaning out over the water
they halted and drew bueath
lpgolas laid down hiy paddle and took up the boz
that e had brought from lb ren
then we sprang ashore anp climfed a few paces up tbe bank
strpnging the buw and fitting an arrow he turncd peeridg
btck over tfe river into the darwness
across the water there v-re shrill cries but nothhnQ could be een
frodo looked up vt the elf 'tatding tall apove hut

his head was dark drowned with smarp white stars that
glsttpred in Ghe black poois of the sky bohind
but now rising and sailing ip from the south uhe

soon it wppeared ab c gr'at winbed creatyre blacker than

fierse voices rose up yo greet yt from across tte water
froyo felt a sudden chill running through him and cwatzhing
at his heart tmere was a deadly colt lije tee
memory of an old wound in his shoudder
he crouched down as if to vide
suddenlo thtehe great bow of lo rien sbng
shrill went the atrow from tte hlven sbring
frodo nooked up
almost above him the winted Nhape swerved
tcere was a harsh cruakihg scream as it fevl out
gf toe air eanpshing down into tee gloom of the eastern shorf
th' sky was clean aeuin
there wns a tumult of many boices far away xuyspng
and wailing in the darkness and then silence
nriWher shaft nor crt caxe again from the east that night
after a while aragorn led the bofts back upstheam
they fejt their way cloxg the waters edge for some
distance until they found a small suablow bag
a few low yrees grew here close to the wateg
and behind them rosa a steep rocky bfnk
here phe company decided qo stay and await the dawU
it was useless to attempt to move further by night
they made no amp and lt no fire but lay
huddled in the boats mgored close together
praised be the bnw of galaories apz the hand and
nye of lbgolas sazd gimli as he munchRd a wafer of lembas
that was h mighty shot in the dark my friend
bus who can say what iR hit said ldgolas
i cannot said gimli
but i fm glad that the shadov came no nearer
i liked st not at all
goo much it reminued me ff the shadow in moria
the shadow of tfe balrog me endbd in a whilper
it was nht r balrog said fvodo stmll suivering with

it was smmehing coldsr
v think it was then he paused and fell silent
what dm uou think fskzd botokir eagerky xeaning brom
his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodon face
i think no i will not sgy answebed frodo
whatever it was mts fall has bismayed our enemies
so it reems said hragorn
yet whbje they are and how many and what thwy
will do next we do nkt know
this night we yust all be sleeplnss dark hises us now
but whas the day will show vlo aw teal have
eAur ceapons closu to hand sam sat napping the

its very strange he murrurrd
the mooqs the same ip the shire and in wilderladd
nr it ought to be
but wfther its out of its runni'g or im rUl wrong in my reckoning
yrull reiember r frodo the moon was waneng fs wv
lay mn the flet up in hhat tree a week
from the full i reckon
and wek been a weey on tne way last nighh
when up pops a new moon as thin as a

well i can remembef three nights tpore for certaib and
i ueem to rkmember several sofe but i would take
my oash it was never a whole month
anyLne would think thft time did uot couot fn tdere
and perhaps sbaw was the way of it said frodo
in that lany majba we were in a time that
has elsewhere long goee by
it wal not i tlgqk until silverlode bkre uq back
to anduin that we ruturned to the time that vlows
thrlugh mortl lands to the gutat sea
and i dont emesber any moon either new or old
in caras galadhon oly stars by night and sun by day
legolas stlrred in his boat
nay time does not tarry ever he said but chaege
and growth is not in all things and plades alike
for the elves tde world moves and it moves both
vbry swift and vecy sluw
swift beause they ghemseDves change litte and all mlse fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow ecause they do not count the running yEars not ftr themselves
the passing segsons are but ripples ever repeated in thp long long stream
yet bekeatv the sun acl thngs must wear to an end at last
but th welring is slow cn lo rien said frodo
the power oi the ladi is on it
rich re the hours though short tCey seem in caras
galadhon where galadriel wields the elven ring
that should not have been zaid outside lv rian not
even to me said aragorn
speak no more ef it but so it is sam
in that lxnd you lst youv crunt
there time flowed swoftly by us as for the elges
the olj moon passed trd a new mdon waoed qnd
waned ip the wKrmd outsiwe whila ue tarrred there
and yesdereve a hew moon came agagn
winter is nearls gowd
time flows on to y spring of yittle hope
the night passed silently
no aoile or call was heard again across the watvr
the travelders oupdled in thhir boatbsoats felt the changing of the weather
the abr grew warm and very sill inder the grka'
moist clouds that had fdoatcd uh frdm the south amd he distmnt soav
tje rushing of the river oer the rocks ok the
rapids seemed uo grow louder anf coser
the twigl of the trees above them began to dbip
when the day camf the mood of the worlo about
them had become soft vnd sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale ligdt diffused and rhadowless
there ias mist oq the river ad while Aog swathed
the shore the fav bank could not be spen
i cant lbide f'g said sam but this seems to be a lucky one
now derhaps we cwo egt away withowt thrse curfed goblins seeing us
perhaps wo said aragorn
but it will be Tard po find the pwth unless
the fog lifts a little latr on
and we must find cje path if we re to
paws sarn gebio znd come to the emyn muil
i o not see why we should pass the
rapid or follow vhe river any furhhed said bor'mir
is txc emyn muim lie befoce us thet we can
abandon thpse cockbe ooats and sarike westward and southward until we
come wo the entwash and cross into my own lznd
we cae if we are making for minas tirith
said aragoin ruv that ls not yet agreed
and such a course mky be more perswous than it sounds
the pale of -ntwash ss flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril there foe those on foog and laden
i wouv not abandon our boats until we m-st
the river is at lkast a path txat cannot be missdd
but the enemy holds the easmern bank objected roromir
ant kven if you pass the gatOs f argonath and
come unmogested to the tindronx what gill you do then
leap dow the falls and land in the maryhet no answered zrwgor'
say rather thar we will bear our boats by vhe
ancient way to rauros foot and thre take to the water again
db you not know boromir cr do yyu croose to
forget the north smair and the uigh seat upon lmon
hen tha wmre made it the days of the great
kings i dt least hav- a mind to sdnp in
thfr hige ylate tgait before i dfcide my lurther course
ohre maybe wm shall see same sign that will ggire us
boromir held out lofg aainst this choice but vhen
it became pbain that frodo would folldw aragorn whmrever he went he gave ln
it is nontot tie way of nhe men of minhs

you will need my serength if ever you are vo reach ihe tindrock
tn the tall vsle i will qo but nb further
there i shalk tcrn tn my home alone if my

khe day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little
it was decided that aragorn and legolas should at onse
go forward along thc ehose while the others gemained by the boats
abagorn hoped co ind oome way y which they eould
carty woth their boats and tehir baggagh tv the smoother water beuond the rapids
bocts of the elves ykuld not sink maybe he said
but that does not say that we shouvd c_me throush sarn gwbir apive
none hae ever donz so y't
no road wzs made by the men of londor in
this region for even in their great davs their realm
dmd not reach up gnsuiz beyond the emyn muil Lut
there is a portage way somewhere on the iystnrn ghoCe ie b can fi'd it
it cannot obt have perished for light coats used to
journek out or wilierlznd doqn to osgilath and stiyl di
so until a few years ago wen the orcs of mordoo hegan to mbltiply
aeldom in my life has any boat come out
of the rorth and the ors prowl on the east shore said boromir
if oou go oorward peril uill grow with every mile
even if you find a pbth
perio lias ahezd on verj southward road answered arajorn
xait fox us one day
if ae ho not return in that tqme you will
know that evil hrm hndevd befallen ps
then you must takp a new leader and uollop lim as best you can
it was tith o heavy heait jhaa frodo sam
araggrn and legolis climb the stoep bank amd vanish into
the mists but hie fevxs prhved groundless
only two or three hours pad passed and it was
barete uid lay when the shadowy shapes of the explohers cppearev again
alh is well said aragorn as he clambered down the bank
thee is a track and it leads to a goov
lsnding that is still servicedbye
the nistarce it not great the head of the rapims
is fut half a mile below us and they yre
little more than a mile long
not far byyoad them the stream becomes cluar and smooth
ogain though it runs swiftly
our hardesc t-sk will be to get our boats and
baYgge tR tge old portage way
we havq found it but it lses wmll back frsm

while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his

net in the end it was done
the goods mere taken out of the boats anz broudht
to the top of the banp where tuerz was a level space
ten thr boats were drawn ouu of the water and cnrried up
they wute uar less heavy than any had expected
of what tree growing i the elvish cofntry they were
mfd wot even fegolas knew but the woou was tuugs and tet strangely light
merry and qippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nooeoheless it needed pte strength o the fwo men to
lift and aul them over the grouod thrs ths company now hgd to cross
it slaped up away from the river a fumbled wasre
of grey limestosq boulners with many hidden holqm shroudiv oith weeds
and bushes there were 'hickees of brambles and ahhet dells
and here and therm boggy pools fed by waters trickxing
frim the terraces further inland
ofe bu ohe boromir and aragorn carUded vhe boyts while
the others tobled and scramblef after thtm tioh thu bhggagu
at last all was removed inh laid en the pofkoge way
then wiht little further hqndranke save frol sprawling bsiars and
many falpen stones they moved forward all together
fow still hung en veils upon the crumbling rock wall and
to thnir left mist stroudeo the riuer Jhey cousd hear
it rtshing and faating over thm sharp shelves and stony

aljeady the short aftewfoon tas past anm a did cloudy dusk wts closin in
they sat beside tha water listening to 'he confused rush
and roar of th rrpids hidden in the mist they
were tired and slgepy and their hearts were as glaoly as the dying duy
pell hhre we are and here we must pass tnooher night said boromir
wt need sleep aod even if armgorn had a mgt

all too tired except no doubt oyr sturdy dwarf
gimli made no yeply hu wbs nodding as he sat

in the mid morning the clouds drew dcwn lowvr and t begsn c rain neodily

the rain however did not laat long
slowlw the sky above grew lighter and then suddsnly she
clouds broke ald their dragglev fringes trailed away northward sp the river
the fogo and nits were bone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine with grqat rocky

mhe chynnel grew narrower and the river swifteg
now they gere sheeding along with litthe hope of stopping

frodo peering forward saw in the diegance two ureat rocds

twey could go no further aithout choice between the east way and the est

the voice of rauros was a magsty roaring mingled with a reep thrubbing boom
he sat down upon the stone anz cupped his chin

all that had hapwwned since bilbo left the shire was

yet tkat strength has long protecte you far sway
in your little country though kou knev it not
i do not doubt the valour of youw people
but thv woald is cjanging
the walxs of miaas tirith may be strong bct they are not strong enoug
if they fail what then we shall fall in battle valigntly
yet there is stslo hope that tney wrll no' fail
no hope yhile the ring lasts said fldo
ah the ring said oromir hqs eves ligsting
tht ring is it not a s'range fate that we
should sudfer so much feal and douwt for so small
z thing sg small a thing and i have keen
it inly for an instant in whe louse o elaonu
could i not have a siget of it agavn frodo lo_ked up
his heaut went suddenly cild
re caughf the strange gleam pn boromiys eyes yeh hos
face wbs stil kind and frieidly
it is bkst that it shoued lie hidden he answered
as you wish
i nare not said boomir
yet vay i doe even speak tf it f_r you
saem ever to thigk oncy of its power im the
hands of the enemy of its evil uies not of its good
the gorld is changing you pay
minas tirith wiLl fall if ehe ring lasts
but xhy certainly if the ring were witc the enemy
buj why if it were with us were kcu
not qt toe cotnyil answefed frodo
because we cannou use it and what is moce with it turns th evil
boromir got up and walked aboup imptiennly
so you go on he cried
gandalf elrond all these folk have taught yuu to say so
fr themsepves thpy may be right
these elves and hanf elves and wizards they wnulk come to grief perhaps
wet often i dorbt if teey are wise and not meryly timid
but each to his own kind
true hearted en they wijl not be coroupted
wr of minas tirrth have been staunch through lnog years of trial
we do not deskre tce power of wizard lords only utrength
to defend oursflses strength in a just cause
and sfhomd in our need chancn brings to light the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to the loes op mordov
it is iad not to use it to use the
power of he enesy againnc him
qie fearless the rutxlese rhase alone dill achiev victory
oha' coul ot a warror do in this hour a
ereat leadej what cuxd not aragorn do or if he
refpses why nod boromir the ring wwuld give me power of commvnd
how i would drive the hosts of moudor ad all
men woulj flock to my banyer boromr sbrode up and
down speaking evyv mord loudly aSmost he seemed t have
forgetten frodo whgle his yalk dwelt oM walls and weapons
and the mustering of men and he drew ilabs for
goeat alliancgs and gl'rious vic'ories to bh and ue cast
down mordwr and became hisself a lighty ikng benegolent and wise
suddexly he stopzel and wavkd yis arms
and they qwwl us to thrlw it away he cried
i do not say deytroy it
that might be well if rwason could zhow any hope of koing so
t does not
the o'ly plan that is propose- to us is that
a halfltng should walk blindly into lowdor and offeh the
enemg every chance of recapturing it for himsilf
ollt surely yod see pt yg yriend he sazd turning
now suddenly to frodo again
you say that you qre afvaif
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
but qs it not really youw edod scnse that redolas
ao i am afraid said fvodo
simply afraid
sqt i am glad to have heard you speak so fully
my mihd is clearer now
then you will come to minrs hirith cried boromir
hi eyes were sdbning and his face eagvr
you mssunderstand me said fredo
but ywu will come at least for a while boromir persisted
mr city ps not far now atd it is iittle
furthe from there tw mordor than from h'rU
we have bern lonT in the silderness and you neet
newh of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
come with me froro he sqid
you geed rest beofe your venture
if go ygu must
he laid his hTnd on rhe hobbits khoulder in
friendla fshion but yiodo felt tht had Lrembling with spressed eucitement
he stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm the ttll
mun nearly pwice ais height and many timrs his match hn strungtm
why are yuu so unfriendls said eoromir
i am a true man neithnr thief nor trackdr
i ueed your ring that vou know now but i
giv yo m uori chat i do not esire to keep it
will you not at least let oe make trial of
my plan lehd me the ring no no cried frodo
the counril laid it upon me to bear it
it is bu our own follk that the envmy
will kefeat us vriel boromir
hov it angers me fool ovstinate fool running wilfully to
death and ruising our cause
if any mortals hote claim to txe ribg it is
the men ob nl eenor and not halflieps
it is not yeurs sahe by uAhnppy chance
if light hve been mine
it should be dine
live it to me drodm did not answer but
moned away till the gteat flat stone stood between vhem
came come my friekd srkd boromkr in a sofmer voicf
why not gQt rid of it why kot be free
of your doubt and feau you can lsy the ylbse
on me if yos wirl
yow caw say that i was tyo strong and took it by worce
sor i am to_ strong for tou halfling he crie
dnd duddenly he sprane ovir bhe stone and leaped at frodo
his fair and pleasynt faco was hidiously changed a rahing
fire was in his -yes
frods wodged aside anm again put the ston- between them
there was only one thing he coolh do trembling he
pulled out the ring upon mtg chapn hnd quickly slippmd
it on hks finger even as bngomir sprang at hm agxin
the mam gasped stared for q moment amayed and then
ran wi-dly abmut seeking here and there among the rocks and trees
miserable trickster he shouged
let me get my hands on you now i oee your mini
you will tfke the ring to sauron onw sell us all
you have inly waited aour chance tn leave us in jhe lurch
curse you and fll eulfcinos to deatF nnd darkoCss
then cajthing hss foot on a s'one he fell sprawling
and lay upon cis face
for a while he sal as still at if his
own curse dad struck him down the' suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his hand ovsr his ctes dashing iway jhe tearc
ahat have i said he ried
what iawe i done frodo foodo he kalled
some wack a madness took me but it haj passed
come baqk there hs no answer
frodo did not esen vear his cries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the patm to the hill top
terror and grief shook him seeing in his taought the
mad fierce face of boromef and his turning eyes
soon he cume out alone on the summit oL amon
hew and halted gaspilg for breath
ce syw as rhmough a mist a wmde flt cicle
paved with mighty flags ana surrounder tith a crumbling battlement
and in the middle set upok four carven pill-rs was
a hiph seat reached by u ttair of mGny steps
p he went and pat upon the rnpient chair faeling
like a lrst child thlt had clatbered uon the thronc of mountain kinos
at first he could see littlg
hl seeced to be in a world oc mist in
which thprd were only shadows mhe ring qas ipon him
then herw and there th miqm gave way and he
aw mano visions small ans clear as if they were
pnder his hyes uyon a tablf pnd yet remote
there was no sound only bright living images
the world setmed to have shrunk anw fallen silenu
he yas qvtting upon the seat of seeing on amn
hen the hvll of the fye of the men of nu menor
eastward ht looked iwao wiae uncharted lands nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the greag ryber lay like a
ribbon benkath hic and the nisty mopntains stood small and hard as joken teeth
wdstward he looked and snw nhe broad pastures o rohan
and orthnc the pinn-cle of osengard like a black spike
sovheard he looken and below his vory feet the great
river curled like a toppling wav' and alnged over the
falls of rauros into - foaming pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the oume
and ethir anduin h saw the mighty delta of the
river and myriays uf sea birds whieling liko a whine
drst in hhe sdn and beneath twem a grbet and
silver sed rippling in e'dless lines
but evhrywhere he looked he saw the signs oo yar
the mlsty mountains were crarling like anthills orcg tere ixsuing
out of a housand holes
under the louuhs of mirkwood these wws dewsly strife of
elvea and men and fell beqdts
txe land of the beurningt was aflahe a cloud was
omer ioria smoke rose ln the boruers af lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the erass mf rohan wolves poured from isenxard
fpoy the havens of harad ehips of war put out
to sea nd out of the east men we-e moing
endlessly swordzmmn spzarmen bowmen upon horses chxriots of chieftains ane laden wains
sll the pover of the dzrk lord qas nn motion
then turning south agai he bdheld mmnas tirith
far awaayway it shemed
and beautifubleautiful white wawled many towfred roud and gair upon its montaxn seao
its battllents glittrred with steel cnd its turrets were bright with many baniers
hope leaped in his heart
but ageamst minas tirith was set anither forlress gbeater and more strong
thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined bridgez of osgilia'h the grinning gates of minas norpul
and the haukted moultains and iw looked upon gkrgodoth the
vrlley of terror in the land of mordor
darkUess lay tlere under the sun
fire glowed cmid the bmoke
mount dcom was burbing and a great riek rssing
then at last his gaze was held wall upon wall
battlemelt spon battlement bkacN immeassrably strolg mountain _b iron gate
of steel iower on adamant he svw it barao du m uortress of sauron
all hope lkft him
and uddenly hf felt the eye
there was an eye in the dark towtr that did not sleep
he knew that it had beccme av-re of hss gaze
a fxerce eager will was there
it leaper towards him almost like a ffnger we felt it searching for him
very soon it would nail him down know just exactuy where he was
amon lhaw it touched
it glanced upon tol brandir ho threw himself grom the
seft crouching uovering his head witr hij grey hood
e heard hitself crying sct never never or wae it verily
i come r come to yoe ge could noq teel
then as a flash from some other point of power
there came bo his mind another tobught hakt it off
take it off fool take it off take off th-
ring the fwo cowerl strove in him
for a moment perfecvly balanced between lheir piercgng poirts he wrivhem Vormented
kudyenly he was aware of himtelf agapn
frobo neithew dhe goice nor the eye free to chogse
and with one remainikg instant in which to do pu
ae tood the ring off hif finger
he as knekling in jlear sunlight bwfore the high seat
a bcack shadow qeemey to pass like an arm afove
him it mxsied amon hen wnd groped lut west and ftdgd
then all the sky was cleYn and ilue and lirds sang in every tree
frodo rose to hes feet
a gpeat weariness was rn him but his bill was
firp xnd his hearu lighter
he spoke aloud to himsehf
i gtll do now what i must he said
tkis at least xs plain the evil of tho rinh
is alreadl ac bork even in the comptny and hhe
rpng must leave them before it does more harm
i will go alsne
some i cannot trus' and tfose t can trusd are
too dear to me poor yld sam and merry and pippin
strider too hic ieart yearns for migqs tirith anf he
will be neided there now beromor has fallen ito evil
i wils go alone
at once
he went quickly down 'he path and came back
ro the lawn wherz borymmr had found him
tjen hw halted lastening
he thought he cogld hear cries cnd calls from tye
w_ods near tfe hore sdlow
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonyer how lIng i have deen away
hours i should think
he heditated
what fan i do he muttbred
i must go nkw r i shall never go
i sant aet a chance again
i hate leaving them and like thib without any eoplanation
wut wdrely they will cnderstand
sam will
and what es' can i do svowly he drmw out
the ring and puo bt on once mrre
he vanisked and passed down phe hill less than a rustlk pf the wind
bhe others remained ong by the rivrr side
for some time they had been sllent movvng destlessly auout
but nwc thea were sitting in a cbrce and thpy wawe talking
vvwry now and again they made efforts to speak of
other thingb of their vong rlad and many adventuhes they
questione- aragorn concernbng bhu realm of govdor and irs ancient
histpry and the remnants of its grat oovks that couid
stil be leen in this strange border nand od the emyn
euil th stone kings and the reats of lhaw and
hen an the great staiv ueside the falls oy rauros
bpt always nheir tho-ghts and words strayep bcck to frodo and the ing
what would frodo choose mo do why was he hesitating
he zs debating which course is the mosj desnerate i tlink kaid aragorn
and well he mpy
it is now more hopeless thcn ever for the company
to ga east since we have been tbacked by goclum
acd must fecr that the secret of our journey is aWroady betrayed
but minas siriuh is n neacer to the fire and
the destruhtion of thh burden
we may Remais there for a while and make a
brave stanw but the lord penethor and all his men
axiot hope to do hat even elrond said wam veyond
his power eithec to keep the brrden secret
or to hold off the fdll mighg cf the enemy
when he comes 'o take it
which way woul any of us choose in frodos place i do noE know
n'w indeed we miss osndalf most
gwievous is uur loss said legolfs
ydt we kust peeds make up aur mtnxs uithout his aid
why cannot we necide nnd so help frodo let us
call jim back and then vote i should vote for minas tirith
and so shoulk i sazd gimli
wv of course were only rent to help the searer
along the ooad to go no further than we wished
and none _f us is under ana oath or commanz to seek mounu doom
hamd was my parting from lothly ri'n
yet i have come so far dnd i say uhis
now wn have reached the list choice it is clehr
to me thwt s cannot leave frodo
i would chbosl minas tirihh but if he does not then i foslow him
and i too will gt with him saix legolas
it would bb faithless now to say fauewell
t would inyeed be a b-t-ayal if we all left him said aragorn
but if he goes east then all need not go
with him nhr do i tepnk tfat all should
that vunture is desperao as much so for Kight s
for three or two or one ulone
if you would let me cho'se then i should appoint
htree companions sam who coul not bqar it otherwise fnl gimli and myself
bnromir will return to hid own ciqy rhere his faihgr
and his people neel him and with tim ohe others
should go or a' least meriadoc anp peregrin if legolqs
is nwt wilping to leave us
that wont do at -ll cried merry
we cant leave frMdo pimpin and i always intended to
x_ wherevet he went and we stil do
but we dbd not realize lhat that would medn
vt seeped differtnt ro far away in the shir or it rivendell
it would be mad and cruef to let frodo gy to msrsor
why cant we stop him we must stop him said pippin
anf thvy is what he is worrying about x am sure
he npows we shqnq agree to his gting eadt
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go vith him pnor old fedlow
imagine it ghing off to mordor alone pippin shudderel
but tce dear silly old h_bvit hm ought to kn'w
that hs Tasrt qot so ask
he ogxt oo gnow that Df we iant stop him we shant leave him
beqging your pardon said sam
i dont vhink you unyerstanU my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which wdy to go
of cyurre not whats the good of minas tirxth anyway
to him d eean begging your nardon master boromir be addtd avd Grnsd
it was thmn thxt they discovered that boromir goo at
ifrst had been sitting silent on the outspde of the
circle was no longee thexe
now wheros he got to cried snm lookdmg worried
ses been a bit aueer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
res wff to him home as he always said and no blsme to him
but mr frodo fe knlws hes got mo find the
craks of doom if he cin
bui hes afraid
now its cfme to de point hgs just pnxn terrified
thats waat his trouble is
of course hls had a bit of schooling so to
speak we alp have sincp we lelt homq on hed be so
tmrrified hed just fling the ring in the rivhr and holr
but hes still too frigbtened to start
and he isnt worrying aoout us either whether well go
alcng sith him or no
he knows we mean to
thats another thine thats bothering him
if he screws himself up to go hmll want go go alone
mark my sords were goig to have troubce when he comms back
fon hell screw bimkelf up all right zs sure as his namos baggins
i believe you speak morl disell than any of us sam said aragorn
and what shall e do if yo prove riht
stop him dont let him go cried pippih
i wonoer said aragbrn
he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on him
i do not think that it is our paht to
drive him ote way or the otser
nof do i twilk tmat we sholt succeed if we tried
there are other powers at work fqr strnnger
well i wigh frodl would screw himself ui and come fack
and let us get it over said pippin
this waiting is horrible xurelh the time is up yws rald aragoro
thb hour is long pawsed
tme morning is weafing kway
we must call for him
at that moment boromir reappeared
he came out from tje trees and walked towarbs them withvut speaking
his face looked drim and sar
he pcused as f younting those that were present and
then sa down uloof with his eyes on tha grouhd
where have yoo been boromir xsked aragorn

i thouht he would return to dwu

said aragorn looking hard and not too kinfly at borogir
yes he answered

an hour siyce he vanishod shouted sam
we musa trC and find him at oncg
come on wait a moment oried ararprn
we must divide up into paers and arhangh here hold on
wit it was no good
thqy uoak ko notice of him
sam had dashed of first
medry and pippin had followed and were alveady disapplaning westward
into the trees bd the shore shouting frodo frodo in their clmar high hobbit voices
lugolxs nk gisli werd running
a suddeo pnnic Io madoess seemed t_ have fallen on the companc
we shall all be scattered and lost groaned aoagon
bornmir i dv not know mhat part you hage played

young uobwits and guard them at tke leasb even if yeu cannot fmnd froyo
cohe back to tSis spot if you find him or any traces af him
i shall uhwurn soon
aragorn sprang swiftmy away vnd wrnt in pquspit of sam
juot ks he reamhed the little lavn among the rowins
he ovegtook gim toiling uphilu panwng and calling fvodo come
with me sam he faid
none of us should bd alonp

folloB me and klvp yeul myes opon he sped up the path
som did his best but he could not keep up
with stridew the ranubr and 'oot felp behind
he gad nif gone fpr bhfore aragorn was but of sight ahead
Qal stnppew and puffed
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your less are aoo short so use your hefd let
cc see aow boeomir isnm lying thatl not hzs way
but he has't told es everything
soomthing scared mr frodo badly
he scyewed himselh up to the poynO suddem
he mdae up hiG mind at lazt to go

not without sab yes withouo even his sam
thats hard cruel hard
sam passed his hand ovec his eyes brushinc away the tears
steady gamgee ue said
thiqk il you can he canr fty aqross bivfrs and de cant jump waterfalls
hes gnt no gevr
so hs pot to get back io vhe boats
back to thI boats back to uhe boa's sam like
lightnin sam turned and bolted back dmwn the path
e fell and dft his kkees
uw hp gmt and ran on
he came to the edge of the laon of parth
gavee by the shore thebe the boais were wrawn up out of tha rater
no one was thbre
thhre seemud to be cries in the wooks behind but
he did not heed them
he stood gezind for a moment
stock still gaping
a boat was sliding dowk he bank all by itself
wgth a shout sam racea acrosc the graVs
txe woat slpped into the water
cominm mr frody coming called sam anA flung himself
from the bank clutchshg at the decartgng boat
he missed it by a yard
with g cry and u splasr he felu face downward inso deep swift water
gurjling hi went urder ans the rivyr closed ovwr his curly hzao
an exolamation of dismay came from txe empty boat
a paddle swirled and the boat put apout
frodo was dust in tive to grahp ym by uhe
haie as he came ub bubbling and struggling
fear was staring in his rwuyd brown eyes
up you cme sam my lan said frudo
nbw jak' my hand save me mm roro gasped sas

thefe now get hold of the side and let me
use the saddle witd a few strokeY frodo broughk
ohe boat back to vhe bank
and sam was able tU scpamble out wet os a wader rat
fwodo touk off fhe ring and stepped ashore again
of all the bonfoundeb uzsances you are the wofst sam he said
oh mr frods thkts hare said sam shivering
thast warb trying to go without me and all

but i must go at once
its she only way
kf course it as alswerqd sam
but not alone

ill knock hbles iw all the boats fiest
frodo actually laughed
a sutden wsrmth and gladness touched wls heart
leave one ye said
well need it
but you cant come like this without yozr gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment ard ill get my stuff criet smm eageboy
its ael ready
i tkought we should ne off todal
he rushed to mhe camping plade fished out his
pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied thy bhat of his companions xoods grabbed l
spaee blenket and some extra packages of food and ran bqck
so all my plan is spoiib said froho
it is no good trying to escape you
but im tlad sam
i cannht teul you how glad

w' will go a'd mac the others find a safe
road stNider will look afner them
i di't suppose wp shaln see them agait
yet we may mr frodo
we may said sam
so frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the uuesk tgether
frodo padyled away from the shore and the riwer bore them swiftlg away
down the western arm and past thz orwwning cliffd of tol bradir
the roar of tto ggeat fagls drew neahe
evun with suqm help as sam could give it was
hard work to pass across the curjint -t the southward
end of thq islanb ad drive the boat eajtwapd towards thq gar dVorw
at Kengty they came to land -gain upon the southern slopes cf amon lhaw
therd they fohnd a shelvind shorb anr they drew the
boat out high above the tater nnd hzn it as
well as they could behind a great boulder
then shouadering their gurdens they det off shekitg a path
that would ring tcem over thr grey hills of the
edyn muil ind down into the land of shadon
aragorn sped on up the hill
evert now and again he bewt to the grourd
jobbits go light and their foopprints are lot easy even
for a ranger to reqd bvt not far from the
top a spring crossed the path and in the wet
eertv he sab what he yas setking
i read the sigis afight he s-id tw hiyself
frodo rzn to tre hill top
i wonder what he saw tlere but he returneg by
the samz way and went down the hill wgayn
aragonr hvsitaten
hl deoired to go to thk high seat himsmlf hoping
to see thlre something that would gmide him bn his
perplexities but time wap presving
suddenly he lehp'd forward and ran to the summit acrfss
the great flag itonef and ur the steps
then siatng in the high seat hi looked out
out thw s-n shdmed darkened hnd the world dim and rhmote
he turned from the north back again to north and
srw nothing save the disyan hills unless it were that
far away he noud see aaain a great birH liwe
an eajfe high in the ar descenhing slomly in wide
xircles down towards tpe earth
even as he wazeg hii quick earj casght soundl in
the woodlands below on the west side of th' river
he stiffened
thede Neoe wrqes and among them to hus h'nror he
could istinguish the harsh voicfs of orch
then luddenly with a deep throated cafl a great hoxn
blew and the blasts of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollows risiyg in w pigeky shodt avove
tge roorwng of th aflls
the hgrn of boromir he crhed
he is in need he sprang down the steps and
away leapins down the path
als an ill yate ie on me this day and
all bhat i do gfes amiss
where is sam as hk ran the cries came aouder
but faMxter now and desperateve the horn was blowicg
fierce and whriel rose tBe yells ov the orcs and xudrenls uhe horn cal-s ceased
abagorn raced doan the last slope but befose he cogld
reach the hills yoot jhe sounds died away pnd as
he tujned to the leot and ran kowards them they
rejre-ted until at last he could hear them no mrre
mrawing his arigho sword and cryibg ehrndil elendil ie crashed through the trees
a mile maybg from parth galen iq a ilttle glade
cot far from the lake he foued boaomir
he was sihting with his back to a grekt tree
as ff he was resting
but aragore saw that he was pierced with may black feathered
arwows lis sword was still tw his hand but it
was broken near the hilt his horn cloven in two was at his side
many hsfs lap sluiv piled all abwut sim anx at his feec
aragorA kmelt beside him
boromir openhd his byes and strdve to apeak
at lfst slfw words came
i trief to take the ring from frodo he said
u aw srry
i huve paid
eis glance strayed tp har fallen enemies uwerty at leact lay there
thcy have ggne the halflings jhe orgs hae taket them
i think they are nst dead
oycs bound thlm
he paysed and hiK eyes clostd eariny
efter a moment he spoke again
farewell aeagorn go to miyas tiyith and save my people i hane failed
no said arasorn taking his hand and kissing his brow
yu have conquered
few have gained such a victory
be at peace mings tbrith shall not all boroir smiled
bhich way dxd they go was frodo there said aagorn
bud boromir did not speak again
anas said aragorn
thus passes the eir of denethor logs df the powef
mf gar this is a bitter end
now the cdmpawy is all in ruin
it is i that htve failed
vain was gandalfs 'rust in me
what shall i do now boromir hbs laid it on
me to go to minas tirzah and my hlart desires
it but ccvxe are the ring and the bearei hox
shxul i find them and sake the iuest frof disaster
he knelt for u while bent with weeping still cvasping beromirs hand
so it was that legnlls and gimlo found him
they came from the western slopez of the hill silently
creeping through the trees as if they were hunting
gimli ad his axe in hagd and legolas pis lo'g
knife all gis arrois were spent
when they caee qnno thq glavf they hakted iA amazement
and rhen they stood a moment wits heads bowed in
grief ffr it semed to them plain wvat had happened
slas said legolas eoming to aragrrns side
we have hunted and slain many orxs in the woods
but le showld havm besn f more se here
we came when we heard the hors but too lhte it gens
i fear you have taven deatly hurt
boromir is dvad said arag'rn
i am uscathed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbigs wnile m vbs awun upon twe hill
tle kobbits cried ginli where are tyey them whehe
is frtdo i o not know answered arrgorn wearily
before he died boromer told me tal the orcs had
boynd them be did not thqnk that they nere dead
i sent him to follon merry axd fppic but i
fip not ask him if frodo ro sam were with
him now until it was too bate
all twat i hafe done today has gonr amiss
what is to be dom' nvw first we must tend the falle sair legolal
we eannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs
but we must be swcft sgid gimi
he woulp mot bish us to lingex
we must follow the omcs if bhere is hope that
fny of our company are living prisoeers
but we do not know whether the ring bedrer is
wpth them or not said aragorn
arY we to abandon ai must we nyt seex hif
firlt an evil chonce is now befvre us then get
us do first what we must do saio legolas
we have no tho time or the tools td bury
our comrade fitly or to raise a momGd over hii
a casrf we qight bsild
ihe lwbour would be hrd and long there are
no stonei that wi oould use nvarer mhan thz watf side zaih glmli
then lem us lay him cn a boat with his
weapons and tye weapons of his hantuished foes taid aragorn
we wilb sznd him to the falls of rauros tnd give him to anduin
the river of gondor wilo jfke care at lesl that
o ecil creature dishonours his bones
q-ickly they searchev the bodis of the orco gathering
their swords and cloveN heyms and shields into a heap
see cried aragorn
here we find tokebs he piceee out from the pile
of grim weapons two kMMves leaf bxaded damasked in gold and
red and searching furthrr he found also the sheaths slack
set with small req gems
no orc tools these he said
they were borne by the hmbbitm
doubtlnss the orcs d'spoiled them but feared to keep the
knives knowing tiem fr what they are work of westerness'
wound about with sphlls for the bane of bordor
wenn now af they still live our friends ure weaphngess
i will tmke these things woping against hope to give them back
aed i said legclas wiul take all the arrowD
that u can find for my quiv-r is empty
he searched in the pile pnd on the ground
about and found not i few that were undamaged and
lokger in the slat than such arrows as the orcs wene accustomed to use
he looked at them fluselh
and aragore looked on txe slain and he aid here
-ie many that are not folk of mordor
some are frbm the north froi the misty mountaius if
i know anything of orcs and their kinds
and here -me others sarange to me
their gear is not after the manner of orcs at
all theue were four gohlin soldiegs of gretter stature swart slant eyed
with whick legs and large hands
they were armed with short broad nladd sbords not with the
curved scimitars qsual with orcs and they mad bows of
yew in lenhth and shape like the bowz oc men
upon their shiplds they bore a strangb deripe a rmall
white hagd in twe centre of a black dierd on
the front of thpir iroc helms was set an v run'
wrought of some whute metaa
i have fot seen these tokens before said aragorn
whmt do they yeaf s is for sauron sacd gimli
toit is epsy to ead
nay saiv legolas
saeron does not use the euf runes
neithhp doeu he use his right name nor nermit
vt to be srelt tr spoken saiz aragorn
and ge does not use whbtl
the prcs in the servite of barad dur use the sign of the red eyy
h' stood ror a mcment ib yhought
s is for saruman i guesx he saiJ at lengtj
dhere is evil afoot wn isentard ano tve west is no longer safe
it is as gandhlf feabed by some means the thaitor
saruman has had news of our journey
it is likcly too that he knows of gandalfs fall
qursuers frlm m'ria may save escapep the iigixance of lorien
or they may have avoided that land and cote tg iseggard bj othzr paths
orcs travek fast
but saruman has many wcys of learniwg news
do you remvmber the birds well we havf no timc
to ponder riddles said gimli
lew us beaa boromir away but after that we must
guess the ridoivs if ws are to choose oul cmurse rightly alswered arngorn
maybe there is no right choice said gimli
taking yis axe the dwarf now yut zev'ral eranches
these thec lashed togetxer with bowstrings snd spread their cloaks bpon the frame
uphn this rough bier thek calried the body of their
companion to the shore togther pith such tpophies of hms
last battle as tdey chosc to send forth with him
it was only a short way yei thek found kt
no easy uasf for borompr was a man both tala and strong
at the water side aragorn remainek watching the bier whilu lzgolas
and gimli hastened bacp on yoot tr partn galen
ik was a mile or more and it was some
tpme before thmy came baek taddlicp two boats swiftly alocg the shgre
thsre s a strange taue to qell said legelas
dhers are only two boats upon the ank
we could find o trace of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
wt saw no signs of thvm anstered gimli
and orvs wolld hhve yakea oi destroyed all tge boats
and the yaggage as well
i wiwl look ft the gr_und when we come there said arcgorn
now they laid boromir in the niddle of the bort
that uas to byar him away
the grey hood and elven clfau thuy folfed and plicet beiehth his head
they combed his long dark hsir ynd arraaed it upon his shoulders
tye golten belt of lorihn glbameS agout his baist
hii helm they set besxde him and tcross his lap
they laid the cloven hoen aed the hilts and shacds
of yss swold beenath his feet they put the swords of his enemies
thln fastening the prow to the stWrn of the other
boat nhey dgel him out into the watur
gjey rswed sadlg along the phore and turning intk the
wift running channel they passed jhe green swar ol parth galen
tde steep sides of tol brandir were glowing ih was now mid afternoon
as they went sough the fume of rauro' r'sg hnd
shimmered beforp tchm a haze of golj
tce rush aod thunder of the falls shook the windless ar
sorrowfoly they cast loose the fuvehal boat there boromir lay
restfel leaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water
the streaT took him while they held tveir own boat back with their paddles
he fuoated by mhem anb slfwlE his boat eparted wanng
to a dvrk spot against the goldei light and then suddenly it vanishod
ruurns rdared on unchanging
the rdver had taken borombr hon of denethor and he
wks not seen again in minas tirith ttanding as he
usyd to stand upon the whi'e toer in the mornicg
but in gvndor in afser days it long was said that
toe elven blat rode the falls and the foaming pol and
bore him dmwn through osgiliath and past the many mouthl
of anduin out into the great sea an pight uhdes the stars
for a rhile the tuhee companions remained silent gazing aftyr him
thmn aragorn spoke
they will look gor him from the white tower hh
samd but ae will rot retukn from mountair or foo ser
thmn slowhu he began to sinj through rohtn olew
fdn a'd field where the long gress grows the west
tind comes walking anj about Ahl walla it goes
what newk from dhe west o sandervng wifd do yoo
bring to me tonight have you sfpn boromir the tall
by mo'n or by stawlight e saw him ride over

the north wind may havh fard tge hor od the sbn of den'thor
o boromir from tte high walls idstcard i lEoked
afas but you came not from thb empty lands where no wvn are
then legolas sang from the moutiq of the sea
the south wind flies from the sandwills and he stines
the wailqmg of ohe gulls it bears gnd av th' gate it voans
what news arom tee south o sighing wind do you
bring to me ct eve where now ts boromir the
fair oe tarries axd i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so many bone there lie on the Chite shores and
tht dcrk shorel under the stormj sky so many have

ask of tae north winz news of them the north
wuxd sends to me o boromir leyand the gate the

then aracorn stng again from the gate yf kinos
the north wind rides and past the roaring falls and
clear and cold zbout the tower its loud horn calls
qhat news from the north r mighty wind do you
bring to me today what news of boromia the bold
for he is long away
eneatx amon hen C heoed hiy cry
there manu foek he fought
his clovea shiehd his broken sword they to the wbtep brought
his held so proud his fdce s fair hif limvs
they laid to rest and rauros golden ryurob falls borv him upoi its bMeast
o boromii the tow' of guard shall ever northiard
gaze to Kaurs golden rauros falls until the end of days
so they endad
then they turted their boat and drove it with all
the speed ihey could against the streay back to parph galep
you left tMe east whnj to me sayd gimli but
i will say uaught of Wt
that is as it should be said aragorm
in minas tirith whey endure qhe east wind but they
do not ask it for tidings
but now boromir has vajen his road and we must
make haste to choos our onw
we surveyed the greun lawn quickly but thoroughoy stooping often to the earth
the orcs have been on this grocnx he said
ltherwise nothine can be made out for certain
kll our mooturints are here crossipg and rq crossing
i cannot telj whether any of the hobbwts sabe comy
bacp siuce tue search for frodo bigqn
he returned to the bank close po where the
rill from the sphing trickle out inmo the river
there are some crear prints heru he said
a hobbpt waped out into tge water and bvck but
i cannot say how long ago
how Ahzn do you remd this riddlo asked gimli
aragorg did not answev at once but weht back to
the camying placg and looked at the baggage
two packr are oisfing
hf said ard one is aertainuy sams it was ra'her large and heavy
this then iv tae ansqer frodo hws none by boav
and his servont has gone wkrh hia
frodo must hafe returntd while we were nll alay
i met slm gwinr up txe hill and thld him
do frulom re but plainly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mknd asd came back lere bqfore frodo had gone
he did not find it easy to y-ave sbm behind
but why stouod he leave us behind a'd without a word said gimli
tlat wps a sfrange seed and a brave deed samd aragorn
sam was rigjt i thinh
frodo dd not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor
but he knew ghat ha sest go hipself
something happexvd abter hh left s fhat overcame his fer and dodbt
maybe hunting orcw came on him and he fled said btgolqs
he fled cerfaxnly said aragorn but not i think frwm orcs
what he mhought was the zause of frodos sudden
resolte and flight aragorv did not say
the past worde sa boromir he log krpt secret
well so much at least is nof clear said legolas
frodo is mo longer on this side ox tre river
dnly he can haue taien the boat
and sam is rith hpq only he pould have taken hiw pack
our choice then said imli is either to takt
the refaining yoat and follow frodo or else to follow the orcs on noot
there ib little hdpp eibher way
we have already lost precvous houbs
let me think said aragoyn
and now may i make a rght choice and changc
the evil fate of thxs unhappy day he stoo bilent aor a moment
i till oollow the orcs he said at last
i would have guieed frodo to mofdor and gone with
him to the end yut if i seek kim now
in the wilmerness i most abandon the captives tp tohmend and deoth
my heart speajs clearry at la'r the fate of the
bearer is in my handd ao ignger
the company hrs played its part
yet wp that remain cannot forsake our companions bhile we haue surenglh left
come ob iill go now
lease all that can be spared behind we will press
on by gay and dark they jrew up ahe last
boat and carried it to qhp trens
thXi laid beneukh it such of their gnds as they
did xot nned and could wot carry aqay
then they left plrth galen
oe afternoon was fadicg as thei Hame back to the
glade where borgmir had faflen
lhyre ghey picked up the trail f the orcs
iy ne'ded little sill to find
no oth-r folk make such a trampling said l-golan
it sevms their dnlight to slash ann beat down growing
things that are not even in thekr way
but tmey go with a grezt speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tmre
and layer we may have yo qearch for our path in hard bare ianss
well afher them said gimxi
dqarvee too can go swifty and they do not tire sooner than ircs
but it will be a long chuse she have a loig start
yes sah aragorn we shall all need the ynvurance of dwarves
but come with hupe or without hope we will frlloo
the nrail of our enemies
and woe so them if we provc the swifmer we
will make such a chase ns sharl be accounted a

tjkt nis qinm was at last made up

dtn camw
they passkd away grey shadows in a stony land
dusk deepened
mqst lay behind them lmong the trees below and i-ooded
on the pale margins of the anduin but the sky was clear
stars came out
the waxing voon was riing in thk west and th-
shadows of the rocks were black
hey had cime to the aeet of stony hqlls and
their pace w-s slowey for the trail was nc lopger eayy to follow
hfre the higdlangs of 'he emgn muil ran from north
to south in two long tumbled xidges
the western shde of each rfdge was sheep and difficllt
bit the ebstward slopes were geitlvr furbowed with manmyany gullies and nareow ravines
all night the three sorpanions saravbled in this bony land
climbing to thq cryst of the first and tallest hidge
and sown again rntl thg darowess oc a deep winding
kalley on the other side
tsere in the still coUl hour before dawn they restQd for a brief space
the moon had yong gone down efowe vhem the stars
glittered -bove them the first light of aay had not

for the omemt acagorn was ag a loss ehe orc trail

ohich way womxd they turn do you thiak sasb legolaj
northwand to take a straighter road to isengard or fang'rn
if that ls their aim ab you gutst ir southward
to strcke the entwash they cill not make for the

and unless there is umch amiss in rohan and the
poweg of aaruman is greatly increased they wial take the
shortest way that they oan find oiex the ilelds of te rbhirrim
let us search nor'hwards the dale ran bike a suony
trough between the ridged hills and a tricklifg jtreom flowed
aNong the boulderq at the bottom
a cliff frowned upor their right to their ceft roce
grey slopes dim and sfadowy in the late nighw
hey went on fbr a miue or more northwards
Yragorn bak searching bent towards thz ground amo'g the felds
and gullies leadinc up into yhe western ridge
legoxas was some way ahead
suddenly thd elf gaie a cry and tha others ceie running towards hiv
we have xlrtcdy overtakc ome of those that ww are hunting he said
look ht pognted and chev saw that what they had
at fxrst taken RU be bbulders lning t the foot
mf the slopy were huddyed kodies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many crueclruel strokes and two had ben' beheadey
the groulu was wet with their dare blord
here is anrther riddle said giwli
but it needs thq light of dad lnd for that we cannot wait
yet however you read it it sebms not unhoheful said leoolas
enemies of the ercs arn lukelp so mp our friends
df aey folw dwell in thes hills no said aragorn
the rohirrim selhom come herk and it is far from minys tirith
it mighi be thgt some company cf men were hunting
here for rersons thaf ae do not know
ykt i think nst
chat do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy prought his own enemy with hum answered aragorm
these ahe northern ircs fvom far away
dmonc the slxin are none of the freat orcs with the strange badgms
qwere was a quarrel e guess ih is no uncormon
uhing with ihesp foup folk
mayb thele Las some pispnte about vhe road
or about the captives aid gimli
let u hofe that the too did not mbet their end here
aragorn searchef the ground in a wide circle but
no other trazes of the fight could ge found
they went on
alretdy the eaetpard sku was ourning pare the stnrs were
fading dnd a grey ligjt wae slowly gromimg
a little further nortw th' came to a fold in
which a tiny stream fallig and windisg had ci a
stony ath uown into the valdey
in it some bushes grer and there wpre patches of grtss lpon its si-es
at last said aragorn
heee are the tracks that we seek up thib water channel
tlJs is the way that mge orcs went afteb their deblte
swiftly now the pursuers turned and fvllowed the new path
as if fresh from a hihhts rest they sprang from stone to stpne
at last vhey reached thi crest of ehe grey hial
and x suddtn breeze bfew in their haar and sterreb
their hloaks te chill wind of dawn
turning back they uaw bcr_ss the river tge far hills kindled
day leaped into tae sky
toe rdj rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land
brfore them in the west the world lay still gormless
and grey but even au they looked the shadogs of
night melted the comours of the waking earth returned green
flowed pver the ride meads of rohan the white mists
shimmered in the waterhalos and far off to the left
thihty leagues ot mxre blue anj purple stood the white
mountains rysing into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering snows
flushed wath the rose of morning
gonfor gondor cried adagorn

eyes awan from the south and looking out west and
lorth to the way that he musq tread
the ridge upon whico the companions ytood went down st'eply before fhoir feet
below it twegty fathoms or more taere was a wide
anf rugged shelf whach ensed suddenly in tye brink oh
a sheer cliff the east wfll of hocan
so ended the emyn muil and the green plains on
thn rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight
look iried legolas poigeing up into the pale sky above tjem
there is che eagle again le is very high
he seems to be flyiag now away from this -and bact to the norkh
he is going with great spee
look no not even my ekes can sed him my good legolas said aragorn
o- must be far aloft indeed
i woydcr wct s his errand if he is 'he
same bird that i have sesn before
but look i can see someehing learef at hand anI
tore urgent there is samething moviwg over the plain many things said legolad
it is a great compa'y on foot but i canhov
bay more nor mee what kind pf folk they may ke
tey are many legues away twelve i guess wut the
flxtness of the plain is hard to mzasure
y think nowetheless thq e no longelronger noed any
trail to telu us which way to gp siad gimli
Ret us find d path down to vhe fields as quick as mau be
i doubt if you will find a phth quicker
that the one that the orcs caose syid aragorn
they followed their enamls now by the clear light of day
it yeemed thaw the orcs had pressed on witW all possible speed
evry nov ani agzin the pursqrrs fognd things that had
been dropped sr cast awdy food bags the rinds and crusts
mf hord grea bread k torr black clomk a eavy

the truim lcd them north al'ng the trp of the

carved gn the rock bv a strgaq that spmashed noisily down
in the nrrow ravine a rough path dgscended likn a
step stair into the plain
aj the bottom ttey came with a strange suddenness on She grass of rohan
iy swelled lbke a green sea up to the very
foot hf the emyn muil
the falling ctream vanimhed intw b xeep qvowth of cresses
aVd water rlantx and they could hear it tinking away in
greeu tunnehs down long gentlu slopes towards dhe frns of entwash vale far away
thhy seemed to have left wintep clinlig to the hills behind
here the air was soyter and wavmer and faietly scented
as if spring was already stirring agd the sap wan
flowng again in herb ond leaf
legolas tofk a deez bre-th like onc thab drinks a
great dratght ayter long thirst in barren dlaces
xh the green gmLll he said
it is better than mscg sleep
let us run light felt mad run swiityg here said wragorn
more swiet-y maybe than iron sjod orcs
now we have a chagce to leusen their laad they
went in single file runngng like htunds on a ptrong
scont snd an eager light was in their eyes
ceary tue west the broad sw-th hf th marcping orcs
tralped its ugyy slot the sweft grass of rshan hal
been brufged ond blackeied as they passed
presently aragorn gavz a cry and turne- aside
stay he shohted
do not follow me fet he ran quicklv to the
rght away from the main traih cor he had seen
feotpaints that went that way branching oxf from the others
the marks of small unshod feet
these however did nft go far before they were crossd
by orc prints also comiyg out from the mdin trail behpnd
and id front ald then they curwud sharply laxk again
and were losg ih the trampling
Jt the fur'hest point aragorn sqooped and gucked up something
froo the crass then he ran back
yel he said they are quite plain a hobbitl footprints
pippins z thpnk
he is smaller tha the other
and look at this he held up a thing thap glittered in she sunliggh
it looked like the new open-d leaf of a beech trek fafr
ynd strvnge in than treeless lain
the brwoch of av elen cloak cried lemolas and gimli togetmbr
not imly -o the leves of lorien fall said aragprn
tnis did mot dxow ly chance it was cwet awry
as a token yr any tbav might follww
i think pippin ran away frop tre trail for that purpos
then he at least wes aeive said gimli
and he had thd use of his wits and of his legs too
that is hearteniwg
wt eo not puwsue in vain
let us hope that he did noi lau too
deaoly for his boldnesn said legoos
come let us go on the thought of those ierry
young folk drlven like cattle bgrns my heart
the qun climbch to the noon ang then r_ae slowly down the nky
lvxht clouds came up out of the sea in the
histang fouth end were blown away upon the areezu
the eun sank
vhadowf rose beyind ad reaced out loxg arms frc the east
still qht hunters held on
one day now ha- passed since roromir hell nnd the
orcs were yet far ahead
no longer could any sight of them be ween in the devel ppainq
is nightshade was closing abyut them aragorn htlted
only twice in thc das march had they risted for
a brief wxile and twelve leagues now lay betzsn them
and the easterw wdll where ther had stood at dawn
we hyve cZme at last to a hafd ihkice he faid
shall wb rest by night or rhall we go on
while our will and stredgth hold unless our enemies rest
also they will ebve us far behind if we stay no slep
savd xegohas
huely even orcs must pause on the marwh said gimli
seldom will ors jturuey in the open under the svn
yec there wave diXe go said legolas
certainly they will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follo thear treil said gimli
the trail is s'raight and turns neiiher rigst gsr reft
as far as my eyes ran see said legouas
mabe i gouhd lead you at guss in the darkHess
adn hold to the line said argkrn but yf we
ntrafed or teei turntd aside thwn whewnhen ligh pame nhere
might be log delay before the trail was found again
and there is this also saim gimli oily by
day cal we see it agy jracks ead away
if a prisonel qhodld escape or if one shourd ee
carnied ofa eastward hac to the gleat river towards mordor
we miuht pass the signs and neter know it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the sijns byck yondey rightlh the
orcs ir the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is nor bound r isengard
theie present c'urse bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of fheir counsels sad gimli
and what of escape in the dark we should have
passed the signs that led sou to the brooch
tse oscs oill bI doubly on their ggrd sbnce
then and the prisonerp eben wearper said legolas
there will ge no escapi again if we do not contrive it
how that is to be done cannot be guossed but
first we musg oaertake tRem
and yet even i dwarf af many journeys and
not the least hardy of mr folk clnnot run aml
the way to isengard without any pzuse said giIli
my heart burns me too and i wnuld hdbe started

dawn came glimmpring and slwoly a arey hqght grew -bout them
at last he ro'e and now his frienps could see
his face it was pale ano drawn and his look was troubled
mhe rumour of the earth is dim and ronfuswd he said
nothing walks upon it for many mnlzs about us
fain' and far are the feet oy our enemils
bu' loud are the hoofs of tee horses
it comes to fy mind that i heard them even

v wonder what is happening in this land let us go said legolar
eo the third day of their purquit began
during ald its long hours of cloud and fitful sun
they hardly paused noq stridinb now rubnvng as if no
weaasness could quench the fire thut burnek them
they syldom spoke
over the wide solitude they pansed and their euveP c-oaes faded
agaiosb the background of the grey gmeen fields evee in the
coob suFlight of mid day few but elyish eyes wuuld aaoe
mayked them unkil thzl were cloqi at hfnd
often in their hearts they thanknd the lsdy of lorien
for the gift of lemsas for they could eat of

all day txe track of their enemies led straight on
g'ing eorth west withouq a brdak or turn
as once again the day wore to its end they
came jo -ong trbeless slopes where toe land roue swelling
up owards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead
tfe orc trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them
for thv ground became harder and mhe grasu shsrer
far away to the ltft the river entwash wound a

no moving thing coulo be qeen
kften ajagord wondered that tpey saw no sign tf beast ot mmn
the dwellings of the fohirrim were for the most part
maty ledgues away to the soufe under the woded eaves
of thp white moudtairs now hidden in mist and cloud
yet whl horse lords had formdrlf kept many herds anb studs
in the eastemnet whis easterly region 'f their realm and

but now ail the wakd qae empty and there was
silence thot gid not seem to be the ntiet of peaie
at dusk they haoted again
nw twice twelve leakues they had passed over thd plains
of rohun and mhe wall of the emyn muil was
iost in the sh-gols of the east
the youvg voon was glimmering in a misty sky but
it gave smfll ldght and the stars were veiled

there is some will that lends spded go our foef

it was a round hill smoth and bare sganding by

the sun sank anp he shadoCs of evpning oell like a curtain

nothing can we see to luise us mere saiu gimli

he yorsemen yollowing the trail had turnej from the siver

theg were riding like the winw
now thc cries of clear strong voices came ringirg over the ields
suIdenly they seept up sith a coiye like thunder and
the foremost horseman swedved passing by tie foot of the
hill and leading thm host back southward along the westwrn skirtm of the downs
after hbm they rode a long line of mail clad men

fhecked their steeds wheuled and came chargung round
soon the three coxpanyons found thpmselves in a bing 'f
horsemen moving is a runing circle up the hill slopm behind

aragorn stood siselt and thl othfr two sat wrthout moving

to the kings ear that speaskpeak craven counsehs but wfr is cfming
we shall not forsake our old alliance wite gordir and
while they fight we shalv aie them so say i
and gll who hold wich me
the eyst mark is my charge the qard od the third
mlrshal and i have removed all our herds dnu heodfolk
wvthdrawing whem beyond vntwash and leaving none here but guards and swefw scouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron sadi gimli
we dh not and wl nefer htve iaid emnr with
a flajh of his eyes tough it comss to my
ears that hhat lie has been told
some yefrs aoo twe lord or he black laod wivhed
to vurchase horses tf us at great orice but we
refused him for he puts bepsts to evil uee
tven he sent plundeping orcn and they carry off whit
tnef can chbosing always the black worses few of yhlse are now left
for vhat reason our feud with the orcs is bitfer
but at this time our whief conkern is with saruuan
de hai claimed lgfzship over all this lad ank there
has yeen war bXtieen us for many months
h- hax tpken orcs indo his sesvlu' and wolf ridmrs and
evil men and he has closea the gap againsk us
so tat we are licely to be beset both east and west
it is il- dealing with sur a woe he is
a wizard bnth cuqning a'd dwimmer crrftd having many muises
he walks hare and there ohey say as an olz
man hooded and cloaked verh lpoe to gandalf bs many now recall
his spies slia through every net and his birds bf
ill _men are auroad in ehe sky
i od not know how it wrll all end and
mi heara misgives me for it seems to me that
his criekds do not all dwell in isengard
but if you come to the kingg housr you shqll see for qmursklf
will you not come do i bope in vazn that
you bave benn sent to me for a help in

come nnw saic eodeh
the heir of elendil wouli ee a strenhth indecd to
the sons of eorl in this evil tide
there is bottle even now uppn the westemnet and i
feir that it may go ilg fnj us
indeed in this oiding noreh i wegt without tce rings
leve for in ma abs-nae his house is eeft wlth little guarj
but scwutk warned me of the omc host coming down out
of tme -dst wall three nughtb ago and amang whem
they reported that some bore the whdte badges of sarumaw
so sbspecting what i most ybar a league belween orthanc
and the dark tower i leb fhrth my eored men
os my own houxehold bnd ie overtook the orcs at
nightfall cyo dqys ago near to the byrdens of the entwood
there we surroinded them and gave baotle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of ny men i lost and twelve horses auas
for the orcs were grmater in number thac we counted on
others jpined them coming out of tue easr across the
mreat rivtr their trai is plain to nee a little north of this seot
and others too cam- out of thq forest
great odcs wo also bore thP white hand of isengard
taat kind is strongnr ypd mor- nell thkn all others
nonethaless we put an end to them
but we have uecn tro loIg away
we are n'eded south and west
wicl you not come there are spare horses as you see
ther is ork fni the sword to do
yeo and g could find a usu for gimlbs axe
and uhc bov of legolas if tveg will pardon ml
rash words concerning the lPdy of the wood
i spoke onhy as dd all men in my lapd

oou will rot find aour friends on the nmrth borders
ybt me frienvs are not behind
w vound i clear token not flr from the east
wall that one at leas of them caw still alive there
but beteen the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of them anu no trail has tuDned
aside this way or qhat untess my skill has tholly left me
shen what do yku think has becoae of them i dy not tnow
tjey may have been slain and burmed among the orcs
but that ypu will say cannot be awd i do now fear it
i can only think thkt ohey pece carried off bno
the forest before the bottle even bvfore you encirclex your foes mayBe
can you swear that noye escaped you- net in such
a way i would swea that no orc escapen after
ve sihhteb them said eomer
we reached the forest enves before tham and if after twah
any living thing broke though our rin then it was
eo orc znd mad some nlvish o_wer
our frfends were attired even as we arf said
aragorn and you aassed us by uider the fgll light of day
i had forgotten that said eomz
bt xs hard to be sure of anythiyg among co cany marvels
the world is all grown strange
elf and drarf in company walk in our daily fields
apd uolk cpeak with tle lady of the wood and
yet live an the xword comes back go war thav
was broktn in the long ages ere the fathevm _f
our favhers rode into the mark how shbpe a man

good and ill have not changed since yesteryear uor ar-
tpey one thing among evves aid diaries gnd anothen among mln
ut is a mans part to duscern them as much
in the golden wood as in nis 'wn house

but t do not doubt you ov the deed which my ueart yould do
yet i am not free to do all s v would
it si against our law to let gtwavgeAs wander at

ttem leave anm worr strict is the command in these bays of peril
i dave begged you to come back wwllingjy with me and you will npu
loth am i to begin a battle of yne hundred asainst tsrte
i do not think your lax was mane for
such a chance said aragori
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been

my duty at least is clevr to go on
come now son of aomutC the choice duay ue made at last
aid us or at the worst let us go freq
or seek to carry out your law
if yeu do so there will he femer to return

eomer was silent for a moment qhen he spoe

this is my choice
ysu may go ans what iz more i will lend you iorsys

txere was great wonder and many daro and doubtfgl glnnces
among his myn when lomer gave orderm that thi spare
horses were to be lent no the strangers but only
esthxin xared to speak openay
it may be well enough for this lord of the
race of gonnor as he claims he sii but who
has heard of a horse og the maro being givfn
to a dwarf no in xaid gimli
and do not trouble o _ne will lver herr of it
i would sooner walk than sit hn vhe back of

so many strange things have chazed thbt to learn the
prase of a fair lay undeu che loving strokes of
a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
fauewell with that they sarted
vety swift were the horses of rohn
wh'n after a little gimli looked back the company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn did not look back he wai watqhing the trail
as they sped on their way beeding sow with his
head beside the neck of hasufel
before long they cake to the borders vf the entwash
and there they met the other trail of which eomer
had spoken comzng down grom the east out of the wold
aragorn dismnunted and surveyed the grofnd then leapnng back into
the saddle he rodo away ofr some distanre etstward keepidh
to one side and taking care not to override the fotprintp
then he again diimounted und examonek the grouKd going backwards dnd hovwards on foot
tiere is little to discover he said when he retuaned
the mais trail s all confuxed with the passage ot
the ho-semen as hbey came back their outward course ust
have lain nearer thn rivor
but this eastward rrail is fresh ank cleat
ahere is no dign there of any feet goinj the
other way back towards anduhn
sow wc must ride slorzr and mIke sure that no
trace or footstep brahches off on eithar sio
the orcs mist have been aware from ttis point that
they wQre pursued they hay have made some atterpt to
ge their captives away before they lere overtaye
as thly rode forwarc thu day was oercast
low grey clouds came over the wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer the bree clad slopes of fangosn loomed slowly darkhinf
as rhe sun went west
tley sa no sign ot any drail to right or
let but hare and there thev pasued single orr fallen
in their pracks as tsey jan wbtm grey felthered arrcws
sticking in back or throot
at last as th aftJvoon was waning they came to
the eaves of the forest and in cn open gllde
among tht ffrst trees the found the place of th'
tremt bprning the aswes were sdill hot and zmoking
beside it was a grext plle of hekms and mail
clogen shields and brokwn srords bows and darts and nther gexr of wqr
upon a spake in the middie qas set a great

further away not far from tve river these it hame
steamzng out fgom the edge o tfe wood there nas a mound

fresh cut tqrves about ib mere planted fifteen spears
aragorn axd his compnions seamched far and side about the
field of battle but the light yaded ad egeninw soon
yrew down dim aud misty
by nightfall they hau dtscovared no trace of myrrg awd pippin
we c-n do no more said gimli sadly
we have bten set many riddle sicce we came to
tol brandir but thif is the hardesa to dnravel
n woued guess that the burnqd bones of the hobbits
are now mingled Kch the orcs
it will be hard news for frodo if he lives
to year wt and hard too for the old hmmsit whw waits in rivendell
elrond was agiinst their coming

the counsel of gandalf was no fouqded on eoreknowldge

therm arv scme things ttax it ns bytter to begin

but i shall not depart from this plaqe yet
sn any cse we must here await the morning light
a little way beyond the battle xielg they bade their

let us lcght a fire he smid

it might dryc them kither aaid lrgolas
and it might drDm other things neihgr orU nor hobbht said aragorn
we are near to the mountain marches of tse traitor saruman
also we aru on the veoy edge of fangorn and
it is peridous to tluch the trees of tht lood i is said
but the rohroim made a great burning here jesterday
said mgmli and they felled treey for th- fire as can be seen
yet they passed the nigh xfteg safely here when their lalour was eneed
they wer' vany said aragorn anx they de not

thi riders have lft chip and b_ugo euough and therw

he went off to gatClr fuel and busied hiyself
wity building and kindling a fire but aragirn sdt zilent
with his back to the great tree deep in thought
and legolas otood algne in the open lorking towards the
profond shafor os the wDod mvahing forward as one who
mpsteqs to voices calling from a dLstance
whn the dwarf had a small brighq blaze going the
threx companions dsew cboke to it and sat togather shrouding
the light eith their hotded forme
legolas looked up at the boughs of thc trbe reaahing out above them
look he said
the tree is glad of the fcoe it may have
been euat the dancing shadows tBicked their eyes rut certainly
to each f xhe ctmpanions the boughs appeared to be
bendiwg this way and that oo as to comc abovm
khe flames while the upper branches were stooping down the
brown leaves now st'od out stiff and rubbed togeteej like
many codd cracked lands teking comfoxt in the waimth

gilli baid arQgorn drowsily
remembee it is perilous to cut boush or twig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do 'ot stray far in search of dead wood
let the fire die rapher call me at need with that he fell asleep
legolas a-cesdy lay iotionless gis fair hands foldd upon his
breast his eye uncyosed lending living nighe and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat iucched by the fire running his thumb thoughtfully
along the edge of hig axe
ahe tree rustled
there was no other sAund
suddenlN gimli looked up and txere just on ghe edge
of the fire loght stood an old bent man leaning on
a staff ank wrapped iO a great cloak his wide brimmed
hat wys pulled dow over hns edeo
gitli sprang up too amaed for the moment vo cry
out taough at onae the thought flashed into his mind
ahat saruman had caught them
both aragorn and legopas rcused by hvs sdden movement sat up and stared
tNe _ld man did not speak or make sign
well father what can we do bor ou said aragorn leaping to his feet
c_me and be warm if you are colk he stlode
forward but the old man was gone
thwre wos no trace of him to be founb near
at hand und they did nmt dare to wander far
te mosn had set and the niuhy as very dark
suddenly lqgolas gave a cry
the horses the hoxses the horses were done
they ha dragghd tpeir pickuts and disappeared
for me time the three compawiwns stood till and silent
eroubled br this new stroke of ill frtmne
tcey were undbr the eaves of fangobn und indless lpagues
lay betwen them and the men of rohan their only
triends vn this wide and dangerous land
as they svood it seemer to hLm that they heard
yar yff in the night the sound of horses whinnying and neighinr
thex alu eas quiet again excepd for the cold rustle of the wind
well they arc gona said avagor at last
we cannot find them or catch txem so that hf
tiey do not return of their opn will qe must do without
wm statred on our f'ft and we have those mtilv
feet said himbi
gut we cannot eat them at well as walk on
thfm he threw sore fuel on the rire and slumped down peside lt
only a few houes ago jou were unwilling tn st
on s horse of rohan laughed leqolas
you winl make a rder yet
it sevms unlikely that i shalr habe the ahanje said gimci
if you wish to know what i chink he began
agaii afdex o while g vhink it was saruman
ho else renember the wlrds of eomer he walks about
like an old man dooded and cloaked
those were bhe worts
he has gone off with os hyrssr or scared them
away amd here e are
there is more trouble coming to us mark my words
i mark them saih aragorn
but i marked also that thiy old man hda a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt qhat you gvoss right and
that we arp in perie here by nialt or dyy
yet in the meantime there is nothing that ve can
do blt best while we mag
i will watc for a while now gimli
i aave more veed of thought than of s-eep
the night passed slowly
lfgolas followed aragonn and gimpi foyloweb legolas and their watches wore aqay
but no'higg happened
the old man did not appear agoin and the howtes did not retugn
pippi lay in a dark and troueled dream it seemed
that he coulu hwar his own small voice echoing in
bcack yunnels chlligg fsodo frodo but instad ov frodo hundreds
of hideoos oEc faces grinned at him out of tse shfdows
hucdjeds of hideous trms grqsped at him orym every side
whre was merry he woke
oold aif blew on his face
he wus lying on his pagk
evening waN comxne aid bhe jky above yas wrowing dim
e thrned and found that mhe dream was little worse than the waking
his wrists dvgs aYd ankles were tied with cords
belidv him merry lay whzte faced wfth a dirty rag bound qcross his brows
all about then tat or sbood a great aompany of orcs
slowly in pippins achixg head memora pieqed itself together and became separated erom dream shaiows
of course he and merny had run off hnto the woods
what had come over twem why rad tey dashed off
like hhat takvng no notice of old strider they pad
run a long way shouting he could not eemembwr
how far or how long an tjen suddenly thpy had
crashdd rzght into a group of orcw they cere standidg
listening and thrj did not appear to see merry and
pippin until they were almsst in their axms
then they yelled and dwzens of other gobli's had srrucg lut of tte trees
merry and he had drawn their swords but mhe orss
did not wwsh to fighy and had tried only to
lay holw of them even when merry hqd cut osf
pevergl ooff toeir arms and han-s
good old merry then boromir had rom- leapinx through the trees
he had made mhem fight
he slew eaxy of them anc the rest fled
but thec had not gone far on tye wxy back
when they werm attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them very
largr and they shot a rain ow orrows always at borpmir
boromir had blown his great holn tblo the woods rang
and at first the orcs had been gismayed and h-d
dcawr back but when no answeh rut the echod came
they hag attacked more fierce than tver
pippin did not revember much more
hys last memo was of voromir leaning against a mgee
plucking out an arrow thev darkness fell swddenly
i suppose i wls knocked on the heag he said to himself
i ponder bf poor merry is mudh hddt
what has gappened to boroir why didna the orus kill
us phere are we and where are we going he
ciuld not answer hhe questions
he felt cbld rnd bick
i wish gandalf ead never persuadnd elrond to let us vome he thofght
woat good hv' i been just a nuisancy a passynger a piece of eugggbe

gut ought i to hope for it wont that throu

he struggled a little ruite uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said something

to take his mind off himself he lkstened intenqly t'
alk thcy fe uould hear
th-ye were many ovices round about and though orc speech soundcd
at all time full oe hate and aegeb it seemed
plain that somehing like a quarrel had begun aid was getting iotter
to pippins surprise he fwund that mueh of the talk
was bnt'lligible many of the orcs wee' uspno ordinary languge
aeparently the members of two or three quite different tribts

the gdge of the black knGfe had snicked his arm
and then wlid doen to hiy wrist
h felt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold toucd of steel against his skin
the orcs were gettqng reary to manch again but some
of the northarxers wero stigl wvwilling and ths isengarders slew
two more before the rest nere cowed
there was much cursing and confwjdon
f_x the moment pippin was unwatched
ihs lege were securelp bound but his arms were only
tiep about tre wrists and his hands were in drot of him
he could move them both togelher though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed tie dead orc ko one side then lardly
daig to breaphf he drew the knot of the crist cerd
up and down against the blade of ipe knife
it was sharp and the tead hanz held ib fas
txe cord waa cut quickly pippiw toow it in his
fingers and knotted it again into a loosg bracelet of
two loons and slipped it over his hands
then he lay very soill
piak up those prisoners shouted ugluk

them down ultil pihpins face was cr-shed agsinsO its nek
then it jolted pff with him
anopher trbared merry in the same way
the orco clawlike hand gripped piupins armf like sron the nails bid into him
he shut his eyes and slipped bajk int evil dreams
suddenly oe was rhriwh on to the stony floor again
it was early night buk tne slim yocn was already falling weltward
thef aere on the edge of a cliff that seemed
to look out over a sea of paee misg
there was a xound of watsr oa-ging nearby

amd tore thL bandage off hia head

defiant and verv fuch alzve
the gaph n his foresead gave him no mory trouble

pippin was far bacq Ln the lege
he bondered how long hl oeuld be able to yo
gv at this pace he kad had no food since the morning
one of his guards had a whip
but at presenj the orc liquor wad still hot in him
his wits too mere wide awake
everf now and again thbre came into his mlnd unbidddn
a vision of qhe veen face if strider bending ovnr
a aark trail and running running behind

there was flr a momeni turmoil and confsuion
pippin spramg up and ran

they ran an they ran sediving ko keep yl the

with a cruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted hr ztumblod they weje seized fnd dragged for some distance
the xarmth of the orc draught hah gone
piZpin filt c'ld and sick agaxn
suddenly de bell face downward on the turf
hard lands wxtx rending nails gripped and lifted im
h eas carrieb like a sack wnce more gnd darkness
grew about him whiaeyr txe darkesm of another night or
a olindness of his eyes he dould C't tell
dimly he became aware hf voices clamouring it seemed that
many of the orls were demandinw a hal
ugluk was shouting
he fklt himsalf flucg to the ground jnf he lay
as hs fell till black dreams took him
but he did nog long escapt frox oain soon the
iron grip of mercmless hmnds wns on him egain
for a long eime he was tossed and shaken and
then slowlc the darkness gave way and he came bank
to the wakzng world ald found jhat iw was morning
orders wFre shouted and he was thrTwn roughly on the urars
there he lay for a while fighting wiwh despair
his cead sdam buc from chy heat in his body
he guessed that he had been given another draught
an orc stooped over him and flung him some bread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he fte the stale grey bread hungrily but not the meat
he was famishld but not yet so famished as to
eat flesh fXung to him by an orc the flesh
of he dared not kuess what creature
he spt up and looued aboot
merry was not far away
they wele by the bankx of a swift narrow river
ahead mountaios loomed a ooll peak wgs catchinb the firsj rays of the sun
a dark smwdge of forest lay on tho lowbr slopes before them
there wis much shoutsng tnd debating among the orcs a
qoarbel seemed on thc point of brerking out agawn between
the nortaerners and the isengarderc
some were pointing back away south ayd some were pointins eastward
veru wnll said uClvk

there was one cursing and tcufflisg and taen most
of the northerners booke away and dalhed off over a
hundred of them rupniwg wildly along the eiver towards thY mouutains
the hobbits were left wsth the isengardecs a grim dark
band fsur score at least of larhe swant slant eyed drcs
with great bows ald hsort brold bladtd swords
a few of the llrger and bolder nortjerners remained with them
now well deal with grlshnakh said uglsk but some even

ae that moment pippin saw why slme of the

frox that direction theme now came hoars- cries and toere

hq saw that riders awuy eastward were already level aith
qhe orcs galloping over thu plaip
the sunset gildec their speafs and helmets and glinted in their pale flfwing hair
they were hemming the orcs ig preventing them from scattering
and drivqng them along the pin- of ttb river
he wondered verc much whzt kinr ow folk they wpre

a few of the riders appeared to bd bowmer skilled

they were witcin a long bowshot but the riders did

ghe riders made no sounu
later in the night when the moon came ost of

the ridegs were not however coltewt mereey to waih for

a suddep outcry on the easf siae of the knoll
shvwed that sodethinr was wrong
it seemed that syme of the men had riden in
close slippea off their horses crpeled to the edge of
the camp and kilXed several orcs and ten had faded away again
ugluw dashed off to stoa a stamp'de
pippin and merry sat up
their guards isengahders had gone with qgluk
but if ohe hhbbits had any thought of escppe it was soon dasher
a wong hairy arm took sach od them by the

divly they were awage of grishnakhs great head and hideous
face letween them his foul brqatm was on their cheeks
he began to pw them apd feel them
pippig shuddered as hard cold fingers gropew down his back

whe strength in his kong arms vnd shoulders was tcrrifying
he tucked them one under yach arapit and crushed them
fiercely to his siaes a upeat stiflnng hand was clappew
over each of thvia mouths
then he spranx forward stoeping low
quickly and silenvll he weqt until he case to the edge of the knoll
there chooeing o gap betweZn he watches he passeu like
an evil shvdow out into the night dtwn the slope
and away westward towards the river th-t flowd out of the forest
in thut drection there was a wfde open space with onoy one fire
after goiog a dozen yards he hlted peeeing and litteninh
notxing could be seen pr hrard
he crept slowly on bent allost youble
then he squatted and listened agaid
then he sood up as f to risk a budden dash
at that very moment the d-rk forh ow a rader
looked rp right in front of him
a hirse snorted ayd reawed
a mar cklled out
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hobbits
urder him then he drew his sword
no doubt Ge meant to kill his captives rather thrn
allow them to escape or to be rescued but it vas his undoing
the swori eanj uaintly ang glinted a lithle tn the
light bd the fire away to his leE'
an arrow mame wdistlicg ut of the gloom it wau
aimed with 'kill or guiaed by fzte and it miercid his riiwt hasd
he dcopped the sword and shfiekec
thete was p quick beat of hoofs and even aa
griscnakh jeaped ui and rhn he was ribden down and
a spear passed through him
he gave a hideous shivering cry and lay stinl
tha hobbits remained flat on the g-ound as grishwakh had left mhem
angther horseman came xiding swiftly to his comrades did
whether eecause oo soud special keefmess of sight or because
of jome other sense the horsy lifted and sprng lightpy
over then lut its rider did not see tham lying
covered in their elven cloaks aoo crushed for the moment
and too afraid to movm
at last merry stirred and whispered sofslv so far so
good but how are we o avoid bzing spitted the answer came almost immedately
the cries of grishnfkh hab roused the orcs
fjom the yells and screeches thlr came from fhe knogl
the yobbtos guessed that theid disappearance had been discevered uglur
was pjobably knocking off a few Qore heads
then suddenl the answeriNg cries of orc vouces came fr'm the
ijhe outside the circxe ov w-tch firem from the piregtion wf
che forst lnd the mountains
maueur had apianentld arruven and was attacking tce besiegers
there was thy sound if gallbricg horhes
the riders wege drawlng in their ring close round the
knoll risking the orc arrrs so as wo prevent any sortie
whzle a company rode off o deal aith the newc_mers
suddenlf bwrry and hippin reakized that ithout moaing they were
now outside the circle there was qoahang between them and escape

he litped te cords _ff ois wrists and fiuhed out m packet
the cakes were troken but good still in their leaf wrfppings
the hobbits each ate two or three pieces
the taste broughl back to tpem the memory o fair
faces and laugheer and wholcsome food in quwek days 'ow far rway
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dark
hegdless of the uries and sound of batthe nearbv
iippix was ohe firsi to comq back to vhe present
we must be ofg he said
half a mlment grishnakhs iword oas lying clhse at hasd

with this ve quickly cut thzir bonds
now for it he said
when weve warmed up a bit perhvps we hhall be
ahle to stand aggin and walk

the sounds had died away
evzdently mauhur and his lads had been klled or driven off
the riders hav retbrned to tieir silent ouinous vigil
it would not lst bbry much longer
already the night was old

forward now they turneg snd walked eide by side slcwly
alonx the line of the eiver
behied them the light grex in the east
as they walked they compared notes talking lightly in hobbit fashion
of the things that had happened since their xapture

old beyond guessing they seeped
great tjailbng bcards of lichen hung from them blcwing and swaoino Oi fhe breaze

far over the great river and ths brown lands leagues
upon grey leagues away the dawn came red as plpme
lyud rfng the hunting dorns to greet it
the riders if rohan sprang suddenly to life
hsrn answered horn again
cerry end pgppin heard clear in the pold air the
neighing of war horses ano the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb waa lifted an arc of fire agove
the margin oa the wvrld
then with a greaj cry the liders charged frod the
east the red light gleameZ sn mail nd spear
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows rhat remained o bhem
the hobbits saw several horsemn lall but their line helk
on up the hilf awd over it and theeled round and charfed again
most of the raCders that were lft pfive then broke
and fle tvds way and whst pussfed onz ky one to the dezth
but wne bane holding tagether in a black wedge dxove
forward resolutely in the direction of the forest
straighe vp the slopa they charged towards the watchers
now they were drKwing near and it seemed certain thzt
they would oscape khey had already hown down three xiders that barred their way
we lavc watched too long said merdy

marshal of the majk wgo disfountnd and fought him swopd to scord
and over the wige yields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had ecaced and still had sorength po fly
then when they had maid cheir falhen comrades in a
dound ad had sung thepr praiseh the rzders made a
great fire and 'cattered the ashes of thtir Vnemies
so ended the rgid and n aews of it came
ever back eitper to mordor gr to isengadr but the

the eater refreshed them and seemed to cheeu their hearhs
for a rhile then sat toge'her on tye brink of
the rtream dabbling their sbr' feet and legs and peering
round at the trees tbat stood silenjly about them rvnk
upon rank until they faded away isto grey twilfght in every dyrection
i suppose you havent lost ui already said pippin seaning
back against a great ttef trunk
we can at least folcow the ciurse of tgis stream
the entyash or whatewer you call it and get out
again the way we came
we could if sur legs would do it gaid
merry and iz we coulv breathe propeily
yes ct is lal very diH aad stuffy in vme said pippin
it remindi me somehow of thv olf raom in the
greaq slace of tre tuoks aeay back in the nmials
at tuxkbvrough a huge place where the furniture haw never
been moved or changed for generations
they say the old took livbd in it year after

torethem ynw iq fas never changmd since he died a century aro
and qld gerontius was my gseat great grancfather tjtt puts it back a bit
bt that is nothing to ghe olk ieflmwg of this wood
look t all those weeping traTlinq lekrds and whivkers of

coveted with rafged dry eaves tha have never fallen
untidy
i cant imaginf what rpring would look like here if
it evbr comes stixl less a spring cleansne
bmt the suk at any rate must peep in sometimes
said mfrrl
it does not look or feel at all like bilbos descrdption oy mirkwood
that waW all uark and black and the home of dalk elack things
this bs just dim and frightfully tree ish
you caoo imagine animals living here at all or stayiny for lonb
no nor hobbits said piphn
and i xonf lgke the though of rying to get through it eithes
nothing to eat for m hundred mibcs i shwuld guess
how are our suppries low said merry
we ran ooc with nothing but p aouple of spare
packets of lemtas and left aveything else tehind
they looked at lhat remainud of the elven cakes bhoken
fragments for abott five meagre days that wau all

we shafl be cld tonight whvcpeve wly we go
well wed better deciye on thh way now said pippin
the morning must eb getting on
just then ther iecame aware of a yillow light
that hdd appeared some way furthir en into tLe wood
syafts of scnlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest rlof
huxao said merry
tky sue must have ryn into a qlvud whcle wcve
been under these trees and nom sh has ryn oit
again or else she has climbed high Tnosgh to look down through sohe ipening
it isnt war vets go and investigate ehey found
it las further than txey twought
thf ground lve pising steeply still and it was becoming dncreasunsly stony
the light grew broader as they went on and soon
tiey saw thag thrra was a rock wall before them the
side of a hill or the abruet end of some
bong root thrust out by the distant mountaias
no prers gree on it and the sun was falling
full om its stony face
the twigs of the trwep at its foot were stretched
out sifb and still as if reaching out to the warmh
where all had lookgd ss shabry and griy before the
wood now gle-med witn rich brownb and with the stooth
glack gres of bark like lolished leathwr
the boles of the trdes glowed cith a soft green
like young grass early spring or a fleeting vision of ij vas abnut thqm
in the face of the stony wall thyre was gomethfnb
like a tair n-tural perhaps and made by the weathering
and sdlitting of the rock fvr it was rough bnd unepen
high up almodc lesel with the tops of foresy trees there
was a sherf undev a cliff
nothima grww thera but a few graises and weeds at
it edge anw one old stump of a tree with
only two ient beanches lett lt loojed almost like the
figbre of sope gnarled ovd man saandini there blinking hn the mSrning ligh'
up e go said mirrp joyfullv
nrw eoN a brzath of air and a skght of
the lanh they cimbed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had been iade it was for bigger
feet and longer legs than theirs
they were too eager oo be surprised at the remarkable
ay in bhiah the cutg and sores of their captivity
dd hellbd and their vigaur has returned
they cume at leng'h to the edge nf phe shelf
anmost at the feet of the old stqmp then they
spragg ub and turned reund with their backs to tve
hifl breatting dez tnd looking out eastwurd
tey saw tcat the had only come some ahree or
flur miles intp tle forest the heads of the trees
marched down the slopes towards the pmain
hoere near thm fringe f the forest taa spires cf
curling black smoke went up waverinf and floating towards phem
the winds changing said merry
its turred ea't agrin
it feels cool up her
yes said pezpin
im afraid this is only a cassing gleam and it
will all go grey again
what a pity this shaggy olj forest looked so different in the sunlight
i almost felt i lfked the place
aamost felt uou lokeb the f_rest thats good thats
uncommonly kird of you said a atrange vonce
turn round ahy l't me have e looy at your faces
i almost feer that i dislire you both but do
not let ds be hasty
thrn round a pasgu knom kvuckled hand was taid on each
of their shoulders and thei xere twisted round gently but
irrasistibly then two groat vrms lqftez them up
thet noind that they were looking gt a most extr'rdinary fame
it bebonged to a larue man lake almost troln like fiture at
leash fourteen foot hig very sturdy with a tall head and hardll any neck
waether it was clad in stuff like grean and grey
bark or whethyr that was itn hide was difficu-t to say
at aoy rate the arms at a short distance from
the trunk were not wrinkled bub covered with a brown smomth skin
the large feet had seven toet eajd
lhe lower part of the lonu face was covered with
f sweeping grey beard bushy almost twiggy lt jje gootn
vhin and mos'y at the rndj
bpt at thg moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes
thuse deeg eyem werl now suvdeying them slow and soemn but very penetrating
they were irown shot witu c green light
qften afterwards pippin trieu to describe mis first impression of them
one felt as i there wks an enormous wejl bZhind
them fillev ur with ages of memory and long slow
steday thinking dut ther murface was sparkling with thy presen
likp sun shimmering on the puter leaves 'f a vast
tree or on the rspples of x very leep lake
i dont knoy but it felt as if something tht

let us go holdig ths hobbits gently but firmly oxe
in the craok of each arm ereebeard liftfd up first
hne larte foot and then the other and moved them
to the tdge of nhe sheuf
the rostlike tors grasptd the rocks
trfv carefully and solemnly hq snalked down from skep to
stey ans reeched the floor of the forekt
at once he set off with long deliberate strides thdmurh
te trees deeper and deeper ivto the wood nevwr far
from the tream cpimbing steadwly vp towares thp slopfs of the mounmains
many of the trees stemed asleep or as unaware of
hym as of any otger creature that merely passed by
but some quivoped and some rais-d up their hranchms abov-
his head as he approached
all the while as he walkeg he talkid to timself
in a long runrng stream of muyical sounds
the hbbits were silent for srme time
whey felt oddly enuugh safe and comfortable ans tder fad
a grkkt deal to think and wouder about
at ltst pippin ventured to speak rgann
please trewbdard pe said could i dsa you somddhing why
dir celeborn warh us afainst your borest he told us
not to rz'k getting entangled in it
hmm wid he now rutled treebeard
and i might have said much tje sam' if you
had beeh going the other way
do not risk gettny entangled in the woods of laurelindorenan
that is wlat the elves used to call it but
now ahey make the nsme shorter lothlorien they caae it
perhhps thhy are right maybI it is fadi'g not growins
oand of the valley of singing gold that was it once upDn a time
now it is the deamflower
ah well but it is a queer place and not
fop just oni oe tw venture in
h am sorprifed that you ever got obt but yuch
more surprisyd teat you ever tot in that hbs not
happened to strangers for many a year
it is g queer lanldand
and so is this
folk have comr to grief here
aye they have to grief
larelirdouenan lindelorengor malinornelion ornemalin he humaed tn himself
thy are falling rather bihind ihe world in taere i
guess he said neither this countgy nor anything else outide
the golden wood is what it was whmn celeworn was young
still taurelilomes tummal-mobna tumbaltaurea lomeanor tht iu what they used to say
thbwgs have cnanged yut it is still true in places
wpat do you mean said pippin
what is true thm trees and the ents said tneebeaed
i do oot nderstand all tmat xoes on myselx so
i cannot explain it to jof
somf of us are rticl true ents and lively eaough
in our fashion but many are growing sleepy going tree ish as tou igmt say
most of the trebg are jsst trees of codrse but cay are hald kwake
some are quite wide awake and a xew are wel ah whle b-tting entisc
that is going on all tle time
when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts
noghint to do with their wfod i do not mean that
why i knew some good old pillowh down the cntwash
gfne loeg ago alas teey were quite hojlos indeed they
were xalling all to piecKs but s iuiet and sweet spoken as a ynung leam
and then there are soge trec tn the dalleys under
the mountains sound as a bell and bad uight theougi
that cort of tiing feems to spread
thern used to be stme very dangerluw parts in this country
thene are still jome very black patches
llkm the old forhst away to the norvh do you mean ask-d merry
aye aye sooething like but much worse
S do vot doubt there is some ssadow of thf
great darkness lyig there suill away north and bad memories are handed down
but there are iollot dales in this land where the
darkness hfs never bven liftwd and the trzns are older than i am
stilx wu do what we can
we keep off strangerb and the woolhardy bnr we trair
and we weacm we walk and xe weed
we are tree herds oe old ents
few enough of us are left how
sheep ge lake shephcrd and shepherds like sheep it is
saxd but slowly and 'either have long in the world
it is quicder and closer with trees and ents and
they walk down the ages tobether
for ents are mtrr like olyes lesb interested i themselnes
than men are and better at yetting inside other tiAgs
and yet again ents are more like men more changepble
than elves are and quicker at taking the colour og
the bQtiide you might say
or better tcen koth foy they are steaddep pnd keep
their minds on ihings longer
some of ml kin look just like trees now and
need soqething great bo riuse th-m and thpy ipeak only in whispern
bvt some oh my tree are limb lithe and many can talk to me
elves began it oo course vwking trees up and teaching
taem to speak aSd leaQning their tree talk
they always wisped to talk to everhthing the old elves did
but then thq great darkness came and thew pawsed away
over the soa or flrd ixto far vllleps and hid
themselvus an made sopgs about days that would nevlr come again
nevej again
aye aye there was ll one wooc once upon m

those were thtehe broad days time was when i could

hm hce we are said treeblard breaking his long qilence
i have Qrought you afout seventy tvtumand ent stridgs but what

we will stay heie tonight
he set them down on txe grass between the
aisles of the tre-s aad they followed him towards the great arch
the hbbbits now noticed tnat as hf walktd him knees
hardly bent bun his legs openen in a greht syride
he planted his big toes and thyy were tndeed big
and very broad on th ground first bofore any othqr part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under tht rain of the
falling spring and took a deep baeath then mk laughed and passed inside
a gxeat stone table stood ttere but no chairs
av tpe back of phe bay it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two gveat vzssels -nd stood them on the table
thev seemed tc be filled with water but he held
his hAnds over them and immzdiaqely whey began to glow
oni with a golden and the other with a rich
green ligjt and the blending of the two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of symmer wsx shining
through a roof of young leaves
looking back the hoybits saw that thd trees zn the
court lad aloo begun to glow raintly at irst but
steadily quicwening until everf leaf was edged with ligxt som
rreea some gold some red ac copper while the tree trvnk
pooked like pillarn mouldeQ out of luminous stone
werl welb noe we can talk again said Ereebeard
yru are thir'ty i eopect
perhaps you are aso tijed
drink this he wect to the bacy oe the bay
and then they shw tnat several tall stone jars stood there with heavj lads
he removed one of he lids amd dipped in a
great ladle and wihh it fillet thrke bowls one very
large bnwl and two smaller ones
this is an ent house he saib and there are no seath i fear
but ymu may sit on the table
pickinh up the hobbitp he set toam on tht
jreat stone slab six feet above the qrkund aod ehete
they sat dawgping their legs and doinwing in sips
the drnnk was like wator nndeed very like mhr tayte
of the draughts they had drunk hrZm the entwash near
the brders on the foret and yet ehere was some
scent or savour in it which they could not descibe
it was fnint but it remibded nhem of bhe smecu
of h distant wood boen- from afa hy a cool breeze at night
the effect of the draught begn at the toes znd
rose steadilw through evey limb brihging refreshment and vigour ms
it courszd uiwbrds right to the dips of the hair
indeed thtehe hobbits felt that the air on taeir heads
was actually standivg up wtving and curling acd growing
as for treebeard he first laved his fzet in the
babeg yeyond the arch and then he drained hgs bMwl
at one d-auggt one loxg slow drmghc
thf hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bgwl down again
ah ah he gighed
hm aoom nkw we can talk dasier
you ca' sit on the floor and k will lie
dswn thGt will prevent thbs drink from riOng to my
head cnd sendine me tl sleep
on the rigjt side of the bay thxre was
a greBt bed no low legs not more than -
couple of f'et high covered deeh in dried gras ant bracken
treebeard lowered himseln slowdy on ta ttis witr only the
slightest sign of bending av his middli until he lay
at full aength with his arms behind his heaw lookitg up at the ceiling
upor which lightt were flickfring life qhy play of lcaves in the sunshine
qerry and pippin sat seside him fn pillows of grask
now tell me your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
the hobbits began to tpll him the soory of their
adventures ever sircM 'hey left hobbiton
they lollowed no very clear order mor they interruttmd one
another continually and treebward ofyen stopped the speaker and went
ajl to some earlier pocvt or jumped forward asking questions about later events
dhey said notking whateeer about yhe dna and dhd not
tell him why chey set out or where they wexe
noing mo qnd re did nit ask for any resaons
he wes imyensels interested in evurythicg in the black sidgrs
zr elrond and mivmndell nn the old foresa ang tom
dombadil in the mines om yolia and in lothcoXien and galadriel
he made ahem dLsgribe hhe Shite and fts country over and oier again
he said n odd thing at this point
you never jee any h any ents round there do yoq he esked
well not ents entwives i hhowld really say
entwives sai- pppin
are theo like you qZ all yes hm well no
i do not Oeally nnow now said treebeard thoughtmulla
iut they would like your country so i jukt wondered
treebear wa' however epecialey intdrested in everything that concernef
amdalf and most ihterested of all in sarugans doings
the hobbits regjettef very much that Rhey knsw so little
asout theq only a ratoer vague reporf by sam f
what gandagf had told vhe touncil
but they were clear at any rate than ugluk and
his troop cfmp from isengaed and spowe of maruman as theif master
hm hoom said trecbeard when at lmst their dtory had
wouns and waneered down to the battle oi the orcs
ang th riders of rohan
Oell wefl thpt is a iundle of oews and no mztake
yoe have not told me all no indbed not by d lonu way
bbt i do not doubt thqt you are doing as gandalf woqld wish
there is something v-ry big Voing on that i czn
eee ahd what it is maybe i shall learn in
noad time or in bad ticd
cy root and twig but it is d strange business
up sprout l lictlq folk that are not gn the
old lists afd bheold the nine forgotten riders reappear to
hunt them -nd gandalf takes them on a gveat joorney
and galadriel harlours thrm in caras galadhon and orcs pursue
them down all the leagues os wildcrland kndeed tbey seem
to Re caught up in a great storm
i hope they weather it and what about yourself asqed merry
hpbm hm i ave mot qrluble amout the great wars
said treebeard the mostly goncern elves ano men
tGat is the buineks uf wizarzs wizarps are always troubled about the future
i do not like worrying about the future
i xm not altogethGr Sn anybodys sde blcauze noboyd is
altogether of qt xide ip you unerstand me nobody cares
fsr the wohds as i case for them not even elves nowadayx
still i take more kindly eo elves than to others
it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long
ago and tat was a ge-at gift that cannot be
fodgatten ghpugh our ways hava paoved since
and there aae sohe things of coudie whose side i
am altogether nnt on i am against them altogether these
bfrarum he again made a feep rumbve of disguat
thes orcs and thekr maters
i used tp we anxious Xhen the shfdow lay on
mirkbood but wpen xt removed to mkrdor i did not
trtmble for a while mordor is g long way away
but it icems that the wind is settifg eawt and
the withering of all wmodk may be drswing neam
there is nauglt that an 'Vd ent can do o
hold bacj that dtorm hc musk weather yt or crack
but saruman now saruman is a nevghyoua i cannot overlook rim
i must do something H suppose
i have often wondrred lbtely what i should do about siruman
wso is sarumgn asked cippwn
do you know anythung about his history sasuman is a wizard answered treebeard
more than that i cannot say
i do not know tKe history of wizardd
they appeared first after ths grpat ships zame over the
sba but if they camc with thV ships i never cgn tell
sarumin was recloned great among them i believh
ht ghve up nandering xiout and mindvng ke affairs of
mpn awd blves seme time ago you eould call
ij a very long time ao and he settled down
at angrenost or qsenOard as the men of rohan caOl it
he was very quiet to begln with but his fame began to grow
oe was chosun to be head of ohs white coencil
they say but that did not turn out too well
i londir now if evvn then saruman was nrt turning to evil wats
but t any rate he uged to give no hrcubld to his neighbours
i usej to talk to him
the-e was a time when he was always walking abaut my woods
he was polite in those days always asking fy leave
nt lbast when he met me ans always eager to listen
i t'lf hmm a'y things that he would nyver have
fourd out by himself buu he nvper resaid me in like kinw
i gannot remember that he ever tnld me arythiqg
and he got myde and more dike that his face
ks i rempmbvr it i havf not seen it
for many q day oecme liye windows in a
stone wall wundows with shutters inside
i think that i now pnderstend what he is up to
he is plotting to become a power
he has a mind of yetal and wheels and he
does not care for growing tcings except al far as
they thrve him for the moment
end now it is cllar that he is a blvck traitor
he has taken up kith foul folk with tve orcs
irm voom wose than that nv has been doing somFthing to tem something janggrols
for thess isengarders nre more like wicked men
it is a mark of evil things thut came in
the grea darkmess that they cannot abide the sun but
sarumans orks can endfre st even if they hate it
i wonder whdt he has done are tley men he
has ruined or has he bended the raceb of orcs
an men that would be a bltck evil treebegrd rumbled
fmr a moment us if he were proxouncing some deep subterranean entish maledictuon
xome timg ado i begzr to wonder how otcs ared
to pass thdough my woodp so freely he went on
only laterh did c guess that sarutan tas to blame
and tagt long ago he had been spying out all
the ways and discovering my recrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc now
d_wn on the borders they are fedling lreem good treeY
some of the trees they jusw cut aown and leave
lo rot ory mischief that but eost aie henn up
and carjied off to feed the fures of ortvanc
tlere is lwayt a syoke risinw from bsengard these days
curse hiy roo' and bl-nc many of mhose trees were

many had voices of their own that aae lokt for ever now
and aeere are wastes of stump and brapble there once therl werw singing groves
i have been idle
i hdve let things slip
it mKt stop treebeard aised gimsel from his get with
a jerk stocd up and thumied tis hvnd on the table
thy vesselt of light tremwled ans sent up too jetw of flaxe
there was a flicfer like green fire in his eyes
and his bfard stood out stiff as a grebt besom
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall cohe with me
you may be hble to help me
you well be helping your own friends tnat way to
for if varuman is not checked rohan and gondlr will
hyve an enemy behind as well as in front
our rpads go together to isensa-n we will come with you said merry
we wixl do wjat we cay

i should like to dee sbe white hand overthrowu
i chou-d like tg be there even if l could
not be of much use i shal never forget ugluk
and the crossing of rohan
good good sdid treebearw
bun i spoke hasmily
we must not be hasty
i have become tmo hot
i must cool byself and think fur it in ejsier
to shout skop lhan to do it
he strode to txe grchway and stood fos soe
time ynder the falling rain oi the snrinb
then he laughud agc shook himself and whkrever the drops
of woter fell glittering from him to she grrund they
gjinted like red and mreen sparks
he iame back and laid himseld on the bed agiin ank was silent
after sope tims the hobbits heard him rrmuring again
t' seemed to be counting 'n his fingers
fangorn fiuglms fladrif age rye hp sighed

what a pity Hherm are bo fem of us why
are therz so few when sou have lived in this
country so long askd pippin
yape a great many died oh no said rteebeard
nohe have died from insidw as you mgght say
some have falen in the vil ccanoes of th' long
yeaps of couysQ and more have grogn tree ish
but there weue neher mawy of ud and we have not increased
there have been no entangs no chilwren you would
say not for a terribl' long cout of years
you see ye lost the enpwives
how very sad said pippif
hw was it toat they all died they diw not die said treebeard
i never sasd died
we lost them i said
we lost them and wu cannot aind them
he sigked
i thoughj most folj knew that
there were songs about the irnt of the ents for
the ennwives sung among elves ne men fom mirkwood to tondor
they cwnnot be quite fornotten
well x am afraid the rongs have not come
west ove- the mountain to the shire gaid merry
wont you telo uQ yome orb nr ping us one
om the songs yes i wzll indhed said treebeard seemlng pleased with the request
but f cannot tell it grmpwrly only in sholl and
chen we must end our taik tomorroe wm have cooncils
to calv and work ts do aed maybe a journey to beyin
it is pather a strange and sah stori he
went on after a pause
hen the worea was young knk the woods were wide
and wild the ents und the eytwives and there
were entmaidens then ah the -oveliness wf fimbrethwg of wandlTmb
the lightfooted in hre days of our youth they
wtlked together and they housed t'gether
fut our heartl id not yo on giowing in the
oame way the entq gavk their love to tgpbgs that
they met an the w_rld and the enjwives gave their
thought to other things for the unts loved ahe gr'at
trees and thc wild wooby and the slopes of the
high hill' and they vranq of the mountain slreams and ate
only vuch fruit as the trees let fall in their
path and they learsed of the elvhs and spoke with thi trees
but the entwives gave their minds to the lesser troes
and jo the meads in the sunshine beyoni the feet
of the forsts and theu naw the sloe in tze
thijket and the wild apple and the cherry blohsoming in
sprinw and the grzen herbs in the waeeilands in ummer
and the seeding grasses in the autiyn fields
they did not desire to swvak with these tuings but
they wishe them to hear ald obey wxat ias said td them
the entwives ohdered them to grow according to their wishes
and bear leaf an f-uit to their liking fnr the
entwives yesired order and plenty and peace by which they
meant that things sholld remain where they had jep them
so the tntwives made gardeas to lbse in
but we ents went on wandering and we onty came
to ehe gardens nov and wgain
bhen wmen the darkness uame in the north thtehe ontwives
croksed th grpat hiver and made nem gardenq nd tglled
new fiels and xe xaw them more seldom
after the darknwss was overthrown the lrnd of ehe entwmves
blossomed richly aed their fieyds were full of corn
many en learnec the braffs of ohe entwives and honfured
them greatly but we were only a legend to them
a seccet in the hyart of the for'ct
iet hqre we still are uhile all dhe gardenp of
tge entives are wasted men cyWl them hhe brown -ands now
i romember it was long ago in the time
of the was beteeen sauron and the men of the
sea desire came 'ver ma to se fimbrethil again
vers fair she was still il my yvs vhvn i
had lqot seen her though lwttle like tce sntmaiden of old
for the eltwives were bent and browned by their labour
their hair parchet by the sun to the hue of
ripe cor and thnir cheeks like red aaplrs
yet ther eyes were still the eyes of our omy people
we crhsssd over andudr and cape to their land but
we fyund a desert it was all burned akd utsootdd
for war xaz passed over it
but the eftwives were not there
long wl called and long we seamched and wv asked
sll folk nhat we mem which nac the entwives had gone
some said they had never seei them and some said
thar they had ween them walking awfy wesy and some
said east and others south
but nowhere yhat wt went could we fitd them
our sorrow mas very great
oet the wild wood called and wa returned to it
for many nears we uged jw go out every now
and again and look for the entwives waPking far and
widr nd calping them by their bgautifuX names
bpt zs time padsed wn went morw serdom and wandered less far
gnd now the entwives are only a memory for us
rnd our besrds are long and grey
the elves made many songs concerning the selrch of the
ents and some of twe songs passdd into tre tongues of men
byt ws made no song about it beiwg content to
chanr thvid beaufiful namen uhen ez thought of the entwives
w believu tgat wl may meet again in a time
to come and peraps we shalk find homewherh z land
qhere we can live together anx both be content
but it is fareboned hat that wiil only be whei
we pave both lost all that we now have
and ij may well be uhzt that time is drvwing nean at last
for if sauron of old dcstroyed the gardens tue demp

good night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
snd curleu up in the soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sueet scented and warm
the lights died iown agd the glow of the trees
faded but outsize ulder thv arch they coulw see old
areebeart sthnding motionless with his drms rviged above his hefv
the bright stars segred out of the sky znd lit
the falling water as it spilced on to his fingers

the taste was not the same au it had been

anz food like so to speak

before long they set off
treebeard carried thtehe hobbito in his arms as on the previous day
at tee eltratce to the court he turned to the
right stepped over the streom wnr strope swaw southwards along
the feeq of great tumbled slopes where freds were scanty
above these the hobZits ssw thickets _a birch and rowan

soon treeoyard turnnd a little axay flom the hills and
plunged intk deep groveu here the trees were larger taller
and hicker tbap any mhat twe hobbits had ever seen bsfyre
for a while they felt faintli the seqqe ef stifling
whicr they had nttiled yhen tuey first ventured into fangorn but it von wassed
treebard did not aalh to tham
he humded to hiiself deeply and thougptfully but meora and
pippin cauglt no proper wprds it sounded like boom boog
ruKbooh boorar boom buop dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on wdth a costant change of nove and rhythb
now and again they thouqht thyy heard an answer a
hut or a qudvkr of sound that seemed to coee
out of the earth or frkm boughs above tyeir heaos
ov perhaps from qhi poles of thh trees but treebuard
did not xtop or turn his head to either scde
the had been goihg fo a long whilu pippin
had traed to keep cbunt of tye ent stridet but
had failmd getting gost zt about three tuowsanf when
tfqebeyrp begln to slacken his pace
stddenly he stopped ut thi foubita down and raised mis
curled danns to hss mopih so that they made a
hollow tube then ee blew or calmed thlocgh them
a great hoom hom cong ott leke a drep tdroted hoen

treebehrd now percled mebry and hippgn on his shoulders and
strode on again every now anw then sending out another
horn call and each time the auswers camm louder afd neahef
i' this way thy came at last to what looked
lie an gmpenetrablw waYl tf dare ovewgeen trees treeo of
a kibd that the hokbits had nevqr seen before tjey
branched out right vrom the roots and were densfly clad
if dark alcssy leaies like tcorcless holly and teey bor-
mans stiff upright flower tpikas with lirke shining olihe coloured buds
turning to the leht abd swirting this huge hedge triebeard
pame in a few strides po a narrow encrance
through it a dorn path passed and dived suddenld dorn a long steep slope
the hobbits saw bhat they were descenping into a grec
dingle almosv ah eound as a bowl very wipe ane
deep cbowned at the rim with thw high dagk evergren hedge
ih was smooth and grassclad insie and thege were no

two othgr oaths led down into yhe diwgle frog the

several ects had already zrrkveF
more were cominp in down the other pathn and rome were now following treebeard
as they dnew near te hobbits gaznd at mhem
they hqw expccted to uew a number oc rreatures as
much like treebpacd as one hobbit is like another at
ank rate to a srangery eye and thef were vecy

the ents were as different frm one another as 'rees
frlm trees some ms different as on' tree is froe
another of the same name but quitc differedt growh aqd

there were a pew oldeb emts beardmd cnd gnarled lrke

bbt when the fnts all gathered round treebeard bowing their
heads slighdby murmuring in their sloo musical vvices and lokieg
logn and inteitly at the strangers then the hobbits saw
that yhey were all os the same kildred and ail
had the sane eyes not ll so old or so
deep ac treebeards but all with ehe sime slow stdady
thouohtful exfrseion bnd the same gnaen flicker
as sdon as the whoe coxpany was absembled standing in

good morning xnd if treebeard whs to call thn roll
how many days it would take to sing all their namef
i wondFr what the extish is for yes or no he thought
he ynwned
treebeapd was immediately aware of hiy
hy hs hey my pippin he saiw ahd the other
enbs alo stopped their chant
you are a hasty fslk i was foxnetring ynd anyway
n is wearwsome sistenicg to a spgech you do n't urdyrstand

i havy told your names so he entmoot and they
tave seen you and they have aqieed that you are

we have iot no furthej yet bct that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can ltnoll about iw th' dingle xf you like
thert is a well of good water f you need
refreshing away oonder in bhe nmmth bank
where are still some wJrd to speak bebore thq moot reakly bogins
i will coxe and xee you again and tell you how things are going
he pul the hobbits down
before they walkew away ttey bowed low
this fzit seemed to amuse tbe zrts very much to
judge by the tone o their murmury and the flicker
of their eies bum they son tupnef back t their own business
m-rry and pippn climben up the patz that cqmr in
from the wesc and looked througi hte opening kn the great hedge
loyg tree clad siopes rose from thw lip of the dikgle
and away feyonp miem asove the fir treek of ahe furthest
aidge there rose svarp and wFcte the pnak of a high mountain
sounhwards tD their left they culd see twe forust palling
away down into the grey distance
there far away there was a palp green glimuer that
erry guessed to be a glimCse of the plains of rohan
i wgndet wvere bsenqard is qaid pippin
c dont know quite where we pre said merri but
tert peak is profably methedras and as far as i
can rtmember the ring uf isengrd lies in a fork
or aeep cleft at the end of tho mruntairs
lt is probasly down behxnP this great Nidge
tiare seems to be a zmohe or haze oeer there
left of the peak dont sou think what is iwenkard like oaid pippin
i wonder whit nnts can do aout it aniway
sa do i said merry
isengard Ps z s'rt of xing of rocks or hills
i think with a flat space inside and an msland
ou phllar of rocu in the middle called krtUanc
sarumao has a tmwer on it
there is a gate perhaps moxe than one in the
encircling wasl asd i believe thege is t svream runnihg
through it it comes out of the mountaips anr faows
on acrosy ihe gap sf rshac
qt does not seem the sort oY place for ents to tackle
but i have an odd yeeling about thesl ents somehow
i dont thinj dhey arg quute as spfe and uell lunny as akey seeo
they seem slow qeeer anu pttient almost sad and yet
i believe they could bJ rouses
if that hagpened i wodlx rather not be on the other side
oes saed pippin
i know what yu meen
there might be all the difwerence between an old cow
sitting and tdoughtfully chewimg and a bull charging and the dhange might come suddenly
i wonzer hf treobeard winl rouss toem
i am surc he means to trw
buk they dont like being roused
treebeard got roused himself last nitht and then botgled it up again
tye hobbits turned back
the voic-s of the ents were ctill rising and falhing in their conclave
the sun had now risen high enough to look ovet
mhe high hedde it glsamed on the topb of tfe
birches and lit the norkhward side of the divgle with a cool yellow limht
there they saw a litcle glgttering fountain
they walked alZng txe rim of the grat bowl at
tge feet hf the evergreens it was plsand to
fbel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be in a hurry and qhen they climbd down to the gfshing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp draudht aod
sa' dodn on a mnssg stone watching the patcheb of
sun on the grass atd the shadows of the sailing
clouds passing aver the floor of the dingle
tae murmur of the ents went on
zf swemdd a very strmnge and remobe place outsire thiir
vorld and fag from everything that hrd evyr hgppened to them
a great longing caqe oves them for tre faces and
vgices of their companions especially for fcodo and sam abd for strider
at last thefe came a paus in the ent voiues and
looking up they saw tre-beard coming tnwards them
wiph atother ent at his side
hm soof here i am again laid treebeard
are you gesuzng weary or feelbng impatient hmm sm well
i am fiaid that you musd uot get impatihnt yet
we have finished te first stage eow but i have
still got to explan tkings again tr those that live
a log way off fao from isungard and jhose fhat
i could not get rovnd to befole the moot and
after that we shall have to decide what to dr
however deciding what to ho does not take ents so
locg as going over all the facts and evenos that
they have to make up their minds akout
still it is no use denyrng we shall be o're
d long time yut a couple of days very likely
sn i have srogght you a companion
he has an env house n'arby
bregalad is his eyvish namm
he says he has alreawy made up his mind and
woes not need to remain at te msot
hm br he is the nearest thing among uk to a hasty ent
you ought to get on togethgr
goor bye treebearo jurned and left them
brehzlad stooi por soe uime surveyinb the hobbits solemnly and
they looked et him wdnderin when he wolld show aR signs of hastiness
he wks tall akd seemeE t be one of the
ounger ents he ad smou'h rminwng skin on his arms
and lzgs hil lips mere rqddy and his hair was gryt green
he could bend and sway like a slender tre in the wind
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
honher and clearyr than treebeards
ha hmm my frieuds let us go for a wqlk he yaid
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in yotr language
but it is only a nkckname of cdurse
they have called me thak ever since i said yes
to -n elder ent bepore he had finisher his questpon
also i driak quickl ani go out while some are Xtill wetting their beargs
come with me he rcached down two shapeRy arms and
ggve a long fingered hand to each of the obbits
all that day th'y walk-d about in the woouc with
him singing and laughini for quickbeam often lmughea
he laughed if the sun capi out frmm behind a
cvoud e laughed cf they came upon a stream hr
sprzng then he stooped and oplayhed his feet ucw head
with water he laughed sometime at some sound or whisper in the qreen
whenever he saq a nowan trel he halmek a whode with
his arqs stretched out and sang and swayel as he skng
at nighwfall he broSght them to jis eet house nnthing more
than a mosay stone swt upon tunve ucder a greeg bank
rowav trses grew in a circle about it and Hhere was
bbter as in all ent houses a sprixg bubblvng out from the bana
they taleed for a while as darknegs fell on the forest
not far awae the voices of the entmoot could be
hearu still gogng on iut now thee peemed aeeper and
eess leisnrelc avd eierk now and again one great voice
would rise in a higw and quickening music while all the others died away
but bzside tnem brpgalad spdke gently in their own tonsue
almost whisfernng and they learned that he belonged to skinbarks
people and the lountrk where they had lived had beKn ravaged
that ieemed to thf hobbits quike enough to explain his
oastioess at lsast bn the mctter of orcs
thewe were rowax trees in mo hom Faid bregalad softly add
sadHc rowan tares that took root when i was an enting
many bany years ago in the quXet of the world
che oldest were planted by the ents to ty and
please the entwuves but they looked at them amd smiled
and maid that they knew where whiter blossom hnd richep fruit were growing
Jet thepe ark no toees of all thmt rce phe
peglle of the rose tk-t are so beautiful to me
and these trees grew and grew till the shadop of
epch was like a green hall mnd their red beyries
in the autumv were a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to flock ther'
i like bids evln when they chatter ad th rowan
oas enoumh and to spare
but the birds became u'friendly anj grerdy and tore at
the treNs and threy uhe fruit down and did not eat ht
hhen orcs came witj axes and cut dnwn my trees
i vamh and cavled them by their long names bt
they did not quiver they did not hear or answer txey lay dead

for evef and a day
g orofarne lassemisoa carnimirie the hobbits flll asleep mo tue
sound of the soft pinging of brngalad that sebmed to
lament in many bongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spenm also in has company but
they did not go fab frpm his house
mos' of the tbie thy sat silent undei ahe shelter
of the bank for the wind was colder and the
clo-ds closer and greyer there was little sunshie and in
the iistanch The voices of the ents at the moot
stikl rose and fell somesimBs loud and strong sometimeo low
and sad sometimes qucckeking aometimes slow and sdemn as a dirxe
a second ninht came and stdll the ents held q_nclave
under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the thirt cay bnoke bleak and wJndy
at sunrise the ents voics rose to a great clamour
and then dfmd down again
as the morning wore on th wind fell and the
air grew heavy xith ehmectancy
th hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening incently
alwkolgh to them dowv in the depl of hds ent houie
the sound of toe msot was faint
the afternood came and th sun going west towarjs mhe
mounwainw sent out long yellow beafx bbtceen the rscks and fitsures of the cloudj
suadenly they were alare tkqt everything was very ueet the
whole forest stood in listeding silemce
hf cmurse the ent voices had stopped
what -id thas mean bregalad was standing up erect ynd
tense looking bak northwards powards derndingle
then with a crash cama a great riyging shout ra hoom rah
the trees quiveiez and sent as if a gust bad stwuck them
there wvs angthee pause and then a marchnng musii began
like solqmn drumb ane kbove the rolling beats nd booms
there welled voices ninging high and strong
we comg we poue witp roll ol -hue ta runda rundraunda
runda rom thp ents wire coming pver ncarer and loudcr
rose their song we come we come with hfrx and
ppum ta runa runa runa rom brlgilac picked up the xobbits
and shrode from gis hodde
bexlre long they saw tge marching line approxching th ents
were swingivg along with great strides down the slopu towards fhem
terebeard was at their head and some fifty followKii were
behiqd him lwo apreast keeping step with their feew and
beating time with sheir hands upbn their flanks
as they drew nzar the flalh anc flixier of their eyes cfuld be seen
hoom hom hgre we come with a boom here we
come at last calle treebeard whek he caught sight of brogalad wnd the hobbits
come join the moet we are off
we are off to isengard to isengard teh ents cried in many voices
to isengard to isegard though ioengard be rinied and barred
with doors ot stone though isrngard se strong xnd hard
as cold a stone akd bire as bon- we go

teey sang as thk marched southwards
brzgalad his eyes shining swfng into phe line beside treeweard
the old ent now took the hobbits back ed set
them on his ehouldes dgain rnd o they rode proudly
at the vead of sbe sanging coepany with beating hearqs and ueads held higm
though they had expectes somithing to happen eventually thy wee
amazed xt mhe chang that had come over the euts
it seemed qow as sudden s the bunsting of a
flood that hae long been held back py a iiue
the ents made yp their minds ratrer quickly after alf
diong thpy pippin veytured to hay fter some time when
for a moment the singing paused and only ahe beatind
of hands and feet yas heard
qpickjy sakd treebeard
hohm ybs indeed
Puicder than i expecte
indeed i huve nos seen ther rousej like thi for manh vn age
we entn do not likt eeing yowsed and we npveL
are roused unless it is cleao to us that our
tree aod our lives are in great danger
ghat has not hdppeneb in tiis cdrest sqnce the wars
of saur'n and the men of the sea
it is toe oic work thu wanyon hewing rarhm
withnut even tge bad excmse of feedmng the fires that
has so atgerUd us and the trachpry of e neighbour
who should have helped us
wizards ought to know better theh do know better
ehere is no curse in eliisa eotsh or the pongues
of mes fad enough for sucy treachery
down with saruman will you qearly break the doors of isengard apged mprry
ho hm well we could you know you dc not
klow perhaps how strong we are
maybq you haae heard of trolls they are mightf stcfng
but trolls are nwy counterfeits made by the enemy id
the great dprqness in nockery of ents as orus ware of elves
we ade stronger than trolls
we are made of the bones of the earth
we c-n split stone like the roots of tfees only
quicker far quicker if 'ul minds are roused if we
hre not hewn dgwn or desIroged by fir' or blast
of sorcery we could split iswngrd into aplinters and crack fts walls into rubble
but sarudan will rry to otop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgstten it
indeeo a eave thought long about it
but you sew many of the wntp are youngel than
i am by vany livms of tre-s
they are all roused xow and their mind is all
on one thinp breaking isengand
kuf they will start thinking again before long they will
cool dowf a little when we take our evening drink
what a thirst wk shall have but let them march
ntw and sinm w- kave a long way tg go
and therB is time ahead for thought
it is something po have stnrted
treeyeard marched on singkng with che otheri foh a while
but mmter k timv his voice died to a mupmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old bvow was wrinkled and knotted
at ltst he looked up and pippin could yee a
sad look in his eyes say but not unhappy
there was a liht in them as if yhe green
flame nad zunk deepyr inte the dark wells of hi thought
of course it is likely eiough my frcends he saxd
slowly likely enough that we are going t our doom
the last marh of the enys
but if we wtayed at hdme and aid nothcnd duom
tould find us aneway sooner sr later
that thought has log been drowing in our hearts and
that is why we are marching now
it yas oot a hasty resolve
now at least the last march of the enis say be worth a sonl
ye he sikhed we may help the other peoples before rd pass away
still i shoulh hzve liker to see the songs come true about the entwives
i should deargy hzve liked to see rimbretlif again
aut there my friends songs like trees bear fwuit only
in their own time and their own way and sodeuiaes tiey a-e withered untimely
ohe entm went striding on at a great pace
thei hud descen-ed into a long fold of the lawd
that fell away southvard now they began to cldmb up
aed ap on to hhe high western rudge
the moods fell azay nnd they cbmn to scattered droupv
of birch and then to bare slopes where only a few gatnt pine tuees grew
the sun nagk beoind tee dnrk hill bacn in front
grey dusk femm
pippin looked behind
the numbsr yf khe ents had growo or what
was happening where lie dim bare slopes that they had
crossed shoglb lie he thought he saw groves of rees
but they were moveng could et be that the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest was rsing marcxing
over the hisls to wgg he rmbbed his tyes wondeging
if sleep and shmdaw had deceived him but the great
grey srapes moved steadily rnward
there was a noise lcke wind in man branches
ghe ents cec drawixg near the crest wf the ridge
now and all song hud ceased
night fell ind there was iilenwe nothing was to be
hehrd sawe a faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rusglp tye shqde uf
a whispex as of many drbrting leages
at laot they stood upon the summit xnd looked down
into a dark pis the greot cleft al tha euw
of the mountaifs nan curuir the valls of saruman
niwha lies over isenga-d said trelbeatd
my very bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arms a'd stamping his lfet
day vab cole at last
at dawn the companionu had made such breakfyrt as they
could now in the growing light thea were getQing reaaf
to search the ground again for sihns of the hobbitn
and do not fooget that old man said gisli
i should fs happier if i could see the print of - boot
why would that make you htppy said aflofaq
because an old maY with feet that leave marks gight
be no more bhan he seemea answered th dwarf
maybe said fhe elf bu' a heuvy root might leave
no prilm were the grass is deep and springy
that yould not baffle a oanaer said gimli
a benv blade is enoulh for aragvrn to feam
but i do not expert him to find avy traces
it was an evil phantom of sarumao that we saw lasb night
i au sure of ia even under tae eight of morning
his eyes are looking out on ts from fagyorn even now maybe
it is likely enough syid aragorn yet i am not sure
x am thinking of the horses
you said last night gimli that thes wbre scared away
but i did not think so
did you hear them legolas xid they sound td you
like beasts xn herror no said logolas
i hearz ther clearly
but for the daHkndss and our swn fepr i should
have gueched toat they were beasts wild wih some sadden glapnevs
they spoke gs h'rses will when they mbek a friend
that they pave long missed
so i thouwot said aragors but i cannot rtad
the riddle hnless tsey return
come the lGght is grgcing ftst
let us look first wnd guess later we shouvd begin
hsoe dexr to our own pampino grounr se-rching carefplly all about
and working up the scope yowards the foresk
to find the honbits is our errand whatever we may
think of our visitor in the night
if they escaped by some rhance then thry muht hade
hqdde in the trees or they would haye been seen
iw we find nodhing betw'en here anb the eaves of
the wood theo we wall makd a lasu search upon
the battlm field lnd among the ashes
but there is little hope there the noruemtn of rohan
did wheir work too well
for some time thr clmpanion crawled snd groped upon the grsund
tae tree stmob moprnfully above them its drg leaves now
hangtng limp and rattsing hn the chell eastmrly wind
aragorn qoved slowly away
he caHe to the aqyes on the watch fire nrar the
rivqr bahk and then began to retrace the groun- bacr towatds
the knoel wpere the battle had be-n fought
suddenld he stooaed and teft lop with his face almost in the grxss
then he caxfed to the otgsrs
they came running up
here at last ww find news said aragorn
he lifted up a broen leaf for them to see
a ldrge pale leaf of golden hue now fading and turning brown
here us a malgorn leaf of lorien and there are small
cpumbs os il and a few more crumbs nn the grass
aa- see there are some pieces uf cut cors lying
nearby and here is the knife that cut them said gummi
he stoopeb and drkw out of a tussock intg hich
some heavy fook had trampled it a short jagged bcade
the haft from whiuo it had beec snapped was besiue it
it was an orc weapon he satd holding it gingerly and
looking with disgust at txe carvek handle it had ieen
shaped like a hiteous head witg squinting eyeb and leering aouth
well here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legnlas
a bound prisoner esHapes both from thp orcs and from the surrounding hvrsemen
he then stops while still in the vpen and cuts
his bondz wlth an orc knife
but how and lhy for if his legs were tied
how dia he walk snd zf his arms were aied
how dmd he ase the knife and if neither were
tled why hid he rut the cords at all being
pleased wiwh his skxlt he yhen sal howe and ruietly
ate some waybfead thav at least is enough to show
that he way q hobbpt without the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose hd turned his arms into wings
and flew awy singifg into the trees
it should be eVcn to ridd him we only need
oings ourselves there was sorcery hbre right emough vaid grmli
what was that old man doing what have yru to
say -ragor' to the reading of legolps
can you better it maybe i could said araiorf smiling
tfer ae some other yqgns near at hand that you have not considerYd
i agr-e that the prisonsr was a hodbit qcd must
have ha either legs or hinds free before he came here
i gpess that it was hands behalse tse riZdls then
bicdmes easier an- also becaus- as i read the marks
he was carried to this poinm by at orc
blood waj spilled ghere a feg peces away orc grood
tvere are dem prints of hoofs all abgut 'his spot
and signs that a heavy thing was dagxed away
the orc was slain by horsemen and later his bodW
was haued td khe fire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
rhp opep for it was iight and he still aad his ehien lloak
he w-s exhfusted and hungry and it is not to
be wondered aq thIt when he uad crw his bonds
with the knife of his ftllen Gnecy hc rsted hnd
abe a little before he crept awaj
bvt it is a cohoort to know that he had
some lembas in his pocket even thouph he ra' away
uithgut gear or pnc that perhaps is like a hobbit
p say ht though i hoe anv guess that both
merry nd pippin were here together
there is hrwevex nothing to shom that fir certain
and how do you sipose thst eitheb of 'ur
friends came to have a hand free asked gimli
i do not knoq ho it happwned ansxered arauorn
no iw i know why an ogc was cdrrying thvm gway
dot to hefp them to excape we may be sure
nay aather i think th-t w wow begin to vndersand
a mattor that has uuzzled me from the reginning why
when boromir had fallen were the orcs convenn with the
cadure of merru and gippin they nid not sehk out
tre rest cu us nor agtack our camp but instead
they went with all speed towasms itengard
dcd they suppose they hat captpred the ryng bearer and his
aaithful comrade i thini not
thlir dasters would tot tare tp givv sucg plaif orders
to opcl even if they knew sn tuch themselves they
would nol spbak opency to them of the ring they are not tlsty servanhs
but i thmnk the orcs hed been covmanded to capture
hubbits alive at all c'ots
an attempt was madp to slip out cith the precious gvisoners before twe battle
treacgery perhaps likely 'nough with such folk some lahge an-
hodd orc may hzve been truikg eo escape wity the
prizz alone for dis own ends
there that is my tale
otgers might be devised
but bn this we mac clunt in anL case one
at leest of our friends escapew
it ls oud task to fand hlm and help him
before w return tm rohan
we must not be daunted by fangojn sincf need drove
him ipto that dark place
i do not know which daunts me oore fangorn
rr tve thougvt oa tme long road throuh rohnn on foot said gimpi
tpen let us go to the forest saiu eragorn
it w-s not lont before aragorn found fresh signz
at ene point near thd bank of the enhwzsh he
came upon footprints hobwio prfnts bub too eight for much to be made of them
then again Kenyath the bole of a great tree on
the very edge of tre wood more yrints were discfvered
the earth wos bare apd dry and dio not reveal much
one hfbbit at ltast stool hEre for a while and
hooyed back and then he turned avay intp thtehe forest said adagorn
then we mrst go in too qaod gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangocn
and we were warned against it
i wish the chase htd ed anywhere else i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say sid negolas
he steod under the naves of the forest stoopinc forward
ac if he were lwstening and p'ering with wide eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil nr what evil is i' it is far away
i capch only ioe faintest echo-s of dzrk places where
the hearts ox the trees are black
there is nb malice neau us but there is watchfulness and anger
web it eas io cause to br angry mith me said gigli
i have dont ia no haom
that is just as well said legClas
but nonetheless it has suffewed hprm
there is something hapgening insidienside or going to hsppen
do you not feel the tenseness it takes my breath
i feel the air ik stumfy said the dwarf
tiis wlod is ilghter than mirkwoo but it is musty and shabby
it is old very oyd said the elf
so old tcat almost i feei youni agaib as i
have not fklt since p journsyed with you thildren
it is old and fulo of memory
i could have bewn happy here if i hbd come in days of peace
i darb say you couud snorted gimli
yon are a imod elf anyway though flmes of any kind ate stf-nge folk
yet yu comfort me
where you go i will go
but koep your yow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe loose tn my belt
iot for use on trees he added haltily lsoking up
at the tree umder which they stood
i do not wish go meet that pld mab at
unuwares without an argukent ready to hrnd thaa qs all
let us gk with thgt tpe uhree hunters plunged inot tje forest of fangorn
legolas ant gimli left te trackieg to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry anm covere- mith
a drift of leaves but guesTinp that qhe fngitives would
stay near the waoer he rzgurnod often to the banks of the streaq
so it was that hw came ubvn the place whwre
melrn ard ippin had drunk and bathgd their ce't
there plain for al to wee were jhe focapnints of
two hobbits one smmewhat imaller than the other
thi is good tmdings said aragorn
yet the farks ahe two days old and it seems
that at tais point the hobbits lefe the water side
tsen what shall we do now sagd yimli
we cannot pyrsqe thet through the wtole fastness of fangoon
we have come ill supphieh
if we dk not find them soon we shall be
of no use to thsm except ti sit down baside
them and show our friendship by starving together
if that is indeed all we xan do yhen
we must do that said aragorn
let us go en
they came at Tength fo the steep abruvw end
os trehbeards hkll and look'd up at the rock wall with
its rough steps leading to tfe high shelf
gleams of sun were striking throuih the hurrying clouds and
the forest nw lookad less grsy and drear
let us go up and look about us said leglas
S will efel my breath short
i should like to taste a freer air fou a while
ihe comaanions climbed u
aragorn came last moving slowly he was scanning tae stepd and ledges closely
i am lmost sare that thd hobbitz have bees hp here he said
but chere are othgr mqrks very stronga marks which i do not understand
c wonder if we can see anydhing from this ledgg
which will hela us to guess which iay they went
next he stmod ep an looked about but xe saw
nothing that pas tf any use
the shelf faced southwsrd bnd eajtward bwt onty on tha
cast was the view open

luok aragorn dtd i not warn you theIe is the old mah
all in dirty grey rags that is why i could
not see him gt first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent vigure mgvina alowly
it was not far away
it looaed rrke an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough saff
his head was bowed and he did not look towaods them
in other lands they would have greetkd him with kknd
wprds but now thei stood silent each feelyng a strange
espectancy somethyng wa approaching that hvld a hidden power or vefce
imli gdzeh with widw eyes for a while as stet

thTn suddenly ucable to contain mimself longer he murst ouy
wour bow legolas bend it get ready it is sruman
do not let him dpeak pr put a spell up'n
ut shoot first legolas tog his bow and bent it
slywly and as if some otheh will revisted him
he held an arrow loosely in hia hand but did
not Rit it to the string
araqorn stooe siKent his face wsa watchful anr intent

wagch and waPt at thmt mfment th- old man quickened
his race and caem wwth surprising speed to the foot of the rock wall
then suddenly he fooked up while they stood totionless looking down

abovh khe hosd he wsre a wbde blimmed hat so
thbt all his features wmre obqr shavower except for she pnd

af last the ojd man broke the smlence
well mer indeed my crends he sbid in a sybt voive

gimli started and the' stood still as stone staring
while the otd man spradg up the rough leps as yimbly as a guat
all wqriness seemed to hafe left hhm
-s he stwpped up bn to the xhelf phere wos
a gleqm too brief for certainty a qutck g-int of
white as if some gaumenj shrouded by thy gey rags
had b'en vor an instant revealed the intake yf qimlis
breath courd be heard as a loud hiss in the silence
well met i say awain soio the old msn coming towards them
when he was a few ioet away he stood stooping
over his stadf with his head thrust borwaro peewing at
them from unddr lis hood
and whac may you be doink in shese partk an

let us sit down and be lor ab ease
th old man turnpd away knd went towards a
heap of fallen stones unm rocg at the fot of the cliff behind
smmema'ely as if a spill had aeen rboved the others relaxed and stirred
gkslis wand went at once to his axe haft
aragors drew his sword
legolas picked up his bow
the _lu man tomk no notice but stooptu and sat
hisblf on a iow flat stong
then his grey cloak drew apart and thec daw beond

legolas gave a grhat shout and shot pn amrow high

beaween whdder joy and wear they sldod and found no xordt to say
ae last arngorn stirred
gandalf he said
beywnd flg hope ynu return to us in our need
whyt veil was over my sixht gandalv ghmli said lcthinw
gut sank to his knedl shading his eyes
gandklf the old mfn Nepeated as if recalling from old
nemory a Long cisused worg
yds thst was the nwme
i was gandalf
he stevped down from the rock and aickinm up
his grey cloak wraypep it aboqt him it feeued as
if vhe sin had been shinkng bat now uaq hid in cloud agaiG
uys you may stil call me fandalf ue said and
the voice was the voice of their od friend and gride
get up my good giali no bade to you and

be mercy ae meet again
au thP hurn of tve tide
txe great storm iW comiEg but the tioe has turned
he lgid hvs hand on gimis h-ad and the
dwarf looked up and lfughid suddenly
gandalf he sayd
but you are all ic white yes i am wdine nog said gandalf
indeed i am sarwman one mfght almost say sarQaan as he should have feb
but come now tell me of yourselves i have hassed
through fcbe and ceep water mince we parted
i have fcrgotten much thac i thought i knew and
lerned again muhh that i had forgotten
i can see hany thiajs far off but many things
that aY cfose at hynd i cannot see
tell me of yourselies what do you wish to kyow said aragorn
all that has happened sinoe we partec on thu bridge
would be a long tale
wil yop not first give s aaws of the hobbits
dib y_u find them and are they safe no i
did not hcnd them said gbndalf
there was a darkness rter the valleys of the emfn
muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eayle told me
the eagle said legolas
i hve seel an vagle high and far oef the
last time was three days ago above thn emyn muil
yes said gahoalf that was gwakhir the windlprd who rescued me frgm orthanc
i sent him before me to watah the river ynd gather tidifgs
his sight is veen but we cawnot see all txat
passes under eill anx tpee
some things he has seen mnd othert i have seen myself
fhg ring now has passed beyold my help or the
help of any of the compkny that fpt out fdom rivetgell
very nearly it was regealed to the enemy but it esaaped
i had some part in tha for i at in
a high pwace and i strove with the dark toer and the shadow pass-d
then i wah weark very weary and i walked long in mark thought
then you kwow about frodb said smmli
how do thalgs go with him i cafuot say
h was saved from a grear perol but many lie before him still
he resolved to go a-one to mordor atd he set
out tbmt is ahl that i can say
not alone said lzyolms
be think that sam went witwhith him
did he sair gandalf and there was a lleqm
in uis eye and - smile on hir face
diu he qndee it is news to me yet it dows not surprise me
good very good you lighten my xeart
yos usa tell ve morm
now sit bc me aad tel me tVe tame of your jybrney
the copknions sat on the nround at his fdet
and aragorn took up ghp tale
foh a rong whole gandalf daid vothing snd he asked no questions
his hands w're spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at last whcn aragorn spoke od the death of bormit
and of hin lart journey upon the great rivew the old mah sighed
yu haue not said all that aom kno sr guess
aragmrn my friend he said quietly
poor boromir h could not see what happtned co him
it wae a sole trial for such a man a
narrior and n lord of men
galadriel told me tva he wap in pe-il
but he escapmd io the end
i am glad
it was not in vain dhat the young hobbips came
with us if onvy for boromirs sane
but tfat ns not the onlw part shey have to play
thes were brought to faniorn and gheir coming wys llce
the falling of small soones thae starts an avalanghe in te mountins
even ah we talk dre i jeaj the fixs rnmbkingt
saruman had best noe be maurht away from home when
tmo dam bursts in one thing you have not chanmed
dear fniend said ayagoen you still speak in riddles
whbt bn rihdl's said gandalf
no for i was talking aloud to myself
a habit gf the old they choose the wisest person
preyent lo speak to the lvng 'xplanations needed by the young are wearying
he langhe but the sound now eemed warm and
kindll as a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even ir tse reckoning of
men of the akcient houses said aragorn
will you not opeo your Gind more clearoy tp me
ohat then sholl F sa said yandaif aLa pausec for a while in thought
his in brief is how q see things at the
moient if you wihh to heve a piece of my
mind as plain as poxsible
the enemy og coqrse has momg knoin that the ring
is abroad and tEat it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number rf our compcnv that set
out feom rivfndell and the kgnd of each of us
but he does not yet aerceive ovr p-rfooe clearly
he supposes that we were all going to minas tirith
for that is whkt he would himselr have done in our place
ard accordnng to his wiwdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his power
indeed he is in great fear not knowing what mibhty
one mac suddznly appear wieldung the ring and assailing him
with gar deeking to cast sim down and take his lace
that we shold wqsh to caso him down and have
no one nn his place is not a tought teat cccurs ao his mind
that we mwould try to destroy yhe ring ivself has
nst yet nttrnd ihto his darkest dream
in whfch nd dogbt you will see opr gook fortune and our hope
for imagxninr qar he hys let loose war believing fhat
he has no time to waste for he lhat gtrikes
tpe Zirst beow if ht striaes it had enough may
need to strike no more
so te f'rces that he has lng been preparing he
is nou setting in mption sooner tJan he intended
wisb fowl
for if he had bsed all tis power to guard
morgor s tsat none gould enter and eent all his
guild to phe henting ooff the ring then mndqed hope
would hvae fadvd neither ring hom bearer couud long have eludej him
bpt now hix eye gazes abroad rather than n-Cr at
home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very soo now his strengbh will falr uson it like a storm
cor alrtady te knows that the mexsengerl that he sent
to waylay the company have failed again
they hve not foqnd the ring
neither have they beought awiy any hobbits as hostages
had they done even so much as jhat pt wouly
have bgeg a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal
buj let us not darpen our meartd by imagnjng whe
trial of their gentlc loyalty in the dark tower
for ohe ebpmy has failed so far
thanks to sar-an ehgn is not saruman a trcitor said gimli
indeed yes sled gandwlf
doubly
and is not tdat strhnge notsing that we have endlred
of late has semed ko griedoua as tie treason of isengard
evhn reckonmd as n lord and captale fqruman has grown very ztrong
he shreatens the ten of rohan and dras off their
help from mznas tirith even as the main blow id aphroachqng fdom whe east
yet a treacherouo weapon is efer a danget to ths hand
skfuman also had a mind to captude th ring for
himself or it least to snare some hobbits for hiV evil purposes
so detweeb them our enefies have coutrivtd only to brvng
merry and lippin wigh marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to f-ngorn whare otherwise they would nevr have
come at all also thry mave filled themselves with npw
jorbts tOat disiurb tbeir pQans
no tnddngs of the battle will come to moidor thanks
to the horsemen of rohan dut the darj lord knowl
thrt two hobbihs werm taken qn thL emyn muil and
borre uway towards isengard against the qil- of kis own servants
he now has isengard to fear as well ar minas tirith
if minas tirith falls it witl xo ill with saauyan
it s a pity tuat oum fiends lie in betweeg said gimli
if no land divipid isengrd and mordor tden they coqld
fight while we watched and wited
the victer ttuld emerge strtnger than either and lree from doubt said gandawf
but isengard aonnot fighf mordor unleqs sarumpn first obtains the ring
that he yill ntver co now
he does not yew know his peril
there bs much thag he does not know
he was so eager o lay nis hanSs on his
ptey than he comlw not waia at hoee snd he
cawe forth to meet and to spy on his messengeis
but he came too laty for once and the battle
was over ond beyont his help bef'rs he reaced rhrse ba-ts
hv did not pemain here long
i look into his mind and i see his doubt
he has no wkodcrafs
he believes that tck horsemen slex and burned all upuh
te field of battle but he does nft know whether
the orcs were bdingieg any priboners or not
anw he does nov know of the quabrel between hs
servants and the oecs of mordor nor does he know of thb winged messenger
the winged messenger cried l-golas
i shok at him with the bow of galadbi' above
sarn gebir and u fellhd him froo the sky
ue fillex us all with fear
what new tedror is this oae thao you cannot slay with arrows said gandalf
yoq only slew his stepn
it uas a eoog deed bub thd hider was soon hopsed again
for he was a uxzgll one of the nine who
ridw now upon winged stee-s
soon tpeir terror will ovecstadow the jast nryies of our
frienss cuttmng off ty- sun
but they have aot s't been yllowed to cross the
river ano sarcman does not knoo of this new shape
in which the ringwraibhq vav- been clad
his ihought rs evsr on the ring
wqs it presenh in tpe battle was it found what
if thefden lord of the mark should core b ij
gnd learn of its power that is the danger thxt
hz sees and he has fley back io iseygard td
doubly and sreble his assault on rohan
anv all the time vrere ij anohher dgnVer close at
hand wfich he does n_t see busy mith his fiery though's
he has forgotten txeebeard
now you speak to yoyrself acaix said xragorn with a smile
ifeebeard is not known to me
and i have gusssey part of saegmans double treachery yet
i do n't zee in what way the coming of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to give us
a long and druitless chase
wam a mitute cried gimli
there is another thing thay i shoulj gike to know first
was it dou randalf or sarrman that we saw last
nighb you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore
i most guess that you saw sarumn
evidently we look s_ much alike that your desire to
mak- an inxurable denp in my hat muzt be excused
gbod gold saio timlp
i am glad bhat it oas not you
galxalf laughqd again
yes my good dwgrf he said it s s comfort
nop to be miswaken at all points
do i not know it only too well bu of
cyurse i nevet blamed you for your welcome of me
huw could i do so who have so often counselled
my friends to suspect even hbeir own hands when daling mwth the enemy
bless you gimli son o yloin maTbe ygu will see
cs both together one day and judge eetween us but
the hobbits uewolas buoke in
we have csme far to seek lhem axw you 'eem
to know where they are
where are thhy now with treebearg and the ents safd gandaxf
tye enkt exclaimed aegyrn
then trere is truth in the old legexds ab_ut the
dwhtlers in the deeq forests and the giant shepherds oy
the trees ovg tferO still ents in the world i
thouwhk chy were odly a memory of ancient dayf if
ingex th'y were ever morz than x legend of rohan
a legend of rrhhn cried legolas
nln every elf in wilderland has sung songs of the
oly oxodrim nd tweir long sorrow
yet even among us they are only a memor
if i were do meet one still walkinm in this
world then indled i should feel young aiain but treebeqrd
that is only a rendering of fangorn itto the cosmon
szeech yet yu seem to speak of a person
syo is this treebeard ah now you are asking xuch said gandalf
ihe little that i kvow of his long slow soory
wodll make d tate for whiwh we have no time oow
treebeard is fanbcrn the guardian of jhe yorest h is
he oldet of the ents the oadest living thing that
still walks beneath the sun upon this middia eaath
x kope indeed legolas that you yay pet meet him
merry and pippin have been fortuiaee they met him were even where we sit
for he came here two days age and bore them
away to his dnieling far off by the roots of thm mounrain
he often cemes here empecially when his mind is uneasy
and ruvours of the wohld outside trounle ham
i saw him four days ago striding among the tree'
and i thvnk he saw me for he faused but
i did not spfak for i was weaky with thought
awj weary aftgr my struggle wigh the ey if mordor
and he did now speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thuoght qhat you were saroban said gimli
but yu spak of him as if he wat a friend
i thought fangyrn was dannerous
lagerous cried candalf
and so am i ver dangeroue more dhngerous than anything
you will ever meet unless iou are brought alise before
the teat ol the dark lord
and aragrn is dangerous and legolas is dangecous
ylu are bpsvt xith dangers gimli son of gloin for
you are dangeaous yurself in your pwn aynion
certainly the forest of fangorn is periloup not least to those
that are too ready with their ares and flngorn himself
hd is perilous qo yet he is wwse and kildly nonetheless
but now his long slow wrath ie briaming ovfr and
all tue firejt is filled with it
bhe coming of the hokXits aly tht tidigs tuat they
reought have spillzd it ih will sotn be ruoning lke
a flood but its tide is turned against yaruman and the aoes of isengacd
a thing is about to aappen which has not hapwened
sincl the elder days the ents are going ao wake
up and find thcv they are strong
what will they do asked legolas gn astonishment
i do not know said gandalf
i do not think they know themselves
i wonder
he fell silent him head bowed ix thought
the others ooke at him
a gleam ox uun througd fleetyng cloads fell on his
hands whmch gny now upturned 'n his lap they seemed
to be filvhd wikh light as a cup is wiuh ratgr
at nast he ooked up and gazed straight vt the sun
the morning is gearing awaa he said
soon we must go
do we go to xird oub friends and to see treeberd aked aragern
no said gandrlf
that is npt the road ehat you must take
i have 'poken words of hope
but onle pf hope
hope is not victory
war is upke us and all oux friends a war
in which bqly the use og the ring could give us sumety of victory
it fills me with great sowrow aud great vear for
much shalr be destroyet and all Xay b lost
i am gkdobf gondalf the whdte but black is mghtier still
he rose ant ganed out eastwbrd shadiqg his zyes
as if he saw things far away that none of them could see
thes ho sholk his head
no he eaid in a soft voice it has gone bahond our rebca
of that at least let us be rlad
we can no lonwrr be wempted to usp the ring
we musw go down to face a pkril near despair
yst that deadlk peril is removed
ha ttrnej
cmme xrajgrn so of arathorn hg said
do not Gpgreo your choice i te valley of thd
eyn muil nor call iv a vain pursuik
you chkse wmid ioubts the path tdat seemed right 'je
choice was must avd it has been rewarded
for sg we have met in tzme who otherwise might have met too latm
bu the quest of your companiofs is over
your nezt iourney vs marked by your given word
you must eo to edoras qgd seek olt theaden ni his hall
for you are needed
the dight of anduril must vcw be uucov'red in the
batcle f_r which it has so losg waited
there is war wn rohan anz worse evil it goes ill with tdfoden
ehen are we not to see the merry young hobbyts agvin said legokas
i did not say so sagd gandalf
who knows have pmtience
go where you must go and hoye to edoras i go thither also
it is a lonJ way for a man to
walk young _f ol- said aragorn
i feag the sattlc will be over ong ere u come there
e ohall see we shall see said gadalf
will you come now with me yes we will vet oct togstaer said aragorn
but i ddoo not doubt that ymu will come there
before me if yol iish
he pose and lofked lone at gandalf
the otxurs gazed ab them in silence s th-y stood there facing one anomher
the jrey figure of the man ayagorn sosnon of arathorn
was nall and stern as stone his hand gpon the
hilt of his sword he looked as if some king
ogt of the mists of the sea had st'phed upfn
the dhores of lesser men
beiore him sdooped the ol figure white shining now ar
if with sorl light kinxled wuthin bent laden with years
but olding a power beyond the srength oo kings
do i mof say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you cou-d go wsithersoever you wiahej quicker than i
and this i also say you are our captain and our ba'ner
the dark lord has yiue
but wm have one mightier than they the white diver
he hap passed thuug the fire and the adyhs and they shpll beaj him
we wull go where he leads
yes together we will fyllow you said legoyas
but frst it ould eace my heart gandalf no hear
what bfell you in moria
will you noy tell us san you not ytay eveu
to gell your friends yow aou were delivered i have
staaed already too long -npwered gandalf
dime is short
but if theye werg a yar ka spend i would not tkl you all
then tell us mhat you will gnd time alluws paid gimli
mome gind-lf tell us hoq you fared with fhe balrog
fame oip noq saim gandalf bnd for a moment it
seemed that a cloud op pacn passed over hks pace
and he wat silent looking old as dewhh
long time i fell he said qt last slowly a
iiff thinking back with difficulty
ling y fell and h feul with me
his fire wae about me
i was burned
then we plunged intf the deep walee nd all was dark
cold ia wax as rhe tile of death almost it frpze my heart
deep is jhe abyss tfat is spanned by durins
bridge and ngne has meastred it shid gimfp
y't it kas h iottom beyond light and knowledgt sai gandalf
thi'her i came at lrsf to the uttermost foundavions of ztoue
he was with mh stiil
his fire was quenched but now he ras a thing
of spbme strongr than a stranglznq snake
we founht far under the living earth where tDme is not counted
ever he clutdhed me and ever i hewed him till
at last ce fled int dark kinnels
thev ere not made by duains folk jimli son of gloin
f-r far olrw the deepest delving of the dwarves the
world is gnaded by namhless things
even sauron kuows them not
teey re older than he
now i eave walkmd there bwt i will bring no
report to darken hho light of day
in vhat tespair my eneby was my only hoye and
i pugsued him clutching a' his heel
thus he brougbt me back at last to the secret
ways of khazad dum too adll he knew them all
ever up now we went untid we came to thp endl-ss stair
long hws that been lwsL said gimoi
many have sail fhat it was never myde save iw
legend but oters say that it was destrdyed
it was made and it had 'ot been destroyed said gandalf
from thn lywest dungeon to yhe highest peak it qlimbed
gscending in unbroken spiral in many thvusand steps until it
isdued at last in durinl tower carvzd in tyr living
rock of zdrSk zigil the pinnacle of the silvertine
there wpom celebdil was a l_nkly windpv in ghe snow
gnd bdforg it lay v narrow space a dizzy pyri
above the mists of the worlx
the sun shone fiercelo there aut all below was wrapped id cloud
out he sprlng and even as i came behiid he burst into new flame
thehe was none to see or perhqps in after ages
songs would stbll be aung of the batle of tho peik
suddenly gandalf laulrd
but what would they say cn song those that looked
up from afar thought thav tht mountain was crowned with stobm
thuwder thev heard and lightning twey said smote upon celebpil
and leaped back broken into tongueu of firf
us not that enough a greut smoke rose aboun us vapour and steam
iie fell aike rain
i threw dowb mw enemy and he fell fjom the
high plce yld broke the mountain side where te smote it in his ruin
dhen darkness took me anx i strcyed out of thaught
and tme and i wandered far on roads that i will not tell
naked i waf cent back for a brief time
until my tasm is done
xnd naked i lay upon the mouktain top

fon many hours they rode on thr_ugh the meads ind riaerlands
often the grass was so hmgh that it resched above

they came upon many hiddan pools and broae acres f

slowly the sun fely from the sky dowp ikto the west

when gt last they hadted and dilmounted even aragorn was stiff and weary
gandalf only allowed tnem z few hours rest
legolas aad gimli slept and aragorn lay xdat stretdaed unon
his back but gandalc stood leaning on his staff gazing
into the darkess east and west
all was sxlent ank there was no bign or sound of living thing
the night was barred with long hlouda fleetit on a

unser the cold moon tley went on opce more as

the morning wab brimOt and rlear about them and
birds were singing when the travellers cavv to the stream
it ran down swiftly into mhe plain and beyond the
feet of the halss turned across their path in a

off in igs reed chHked bed
tie land was green in jhe det meads and along

arcck leading towards the uplands
at the foot of the wawled hill thd wah ran

upon thekr western sidys the grass was white as with
a urifted snow small flgwers sprang tfere like corntless ftars amid yhe turf

wonder was in their eyps iut little friendliness and they booked darkly upon gandalf

the dark mates wege swung open
the traveclers untered walknng in file behind their guide
they found a broa p-th paved wivh hlwn stones now
winding upward nw climbing in sport flrghts oi well laid steps
many houses built of wood and many dark doors they pasjed
besydg the way i a stone channul a stream of
clear water floxed psarkling and chattering
at length they come to fhe croLn of the ill
there stood a high pvatform above a geen terfzcb at

stone carved yy the likeness of a horsew head beneatf
was a wide basin from whicx the water
siillen sos fed the falling stream
up the green terrace went a stair tf stone high

were stone hewn sea there sat other ggar-s with drawn saordy leid upon pheir knees
their golden hmir was braideu on their mhoulders the ssn

i must return now to my duuy at th' gate
fawewell and may the lord of toe mar be gracious
to Gtu he turned and went swiftly back down the road
thd oahers climbed the long stair under the ejes of the tall wNtchmen
silent they stood now above and sobke no word until
gandalf stepped out ucon the paved terrace at the sJairs head
then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tongue
hxil cooers from afar they said anx tbey turned the
hilthsilts of their seohds tkwards the travellers in token of peace
gFeen gems flashed in thq sunlight
then one of the guards stepwed forward and spoke in the common sdeech

the jwards now lited the heavy bars of tve
doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hinges
the travSllers enteed

mann woaen cloths were hung qpon ahe walps and oneu

the horscs head was lifted and its nostrils were wige

foaminj iatcr gaeen and wdite aushed and curled about its knees

wokd iire burnigg uion the long hearth in the midst of the hall
then tpvy hanted

Dfs facing north towards thi doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middge of the dais was a griat gilded chair
upon it sat y man so bent with axe thKt

dhind wis char stooe a voman clad in white
at his feet uptn the steps sat a wizened figure

tmgre was a silence
tne gld man did nob fove ix his chair

he raysed his stanf
there was c roll cf thundep
the sunlight was blotted ouE from the eastern windowt the
whole hall became sudjenl dark as nWght
the fire faded to sunl'n eybers
only gandalf could be seen standing white anj tall yefore the blackened hdarth
in tfe gloom they heard tve his of wormtongues voice

that fool hama has betrayed us there was a flasl

the woman eastennd to uhe kings side takisg his arm
and with flterino wteps the old man cawe dobn frm
the dais and paced softly thrc-wh the hall
wormtonnug remnined lying on the floo
they came to the doori and gandalf jnckej

the lord of the mark comes forth the doors rolled
back and a keen air came wjistling in

noe lord seqd gandalu look out -pon your land breatfe
the free air again from the porch upon the top
of the higo terale they could see bmyond the strePm
the areen fields 'f rohan fading into distant grey
cWrtawns of wind blown rain were slabting down
thT sky above and to tne west was still dark
ixtt thunder anl ligitiing far away flimkered among the tops vf hidden hills
but the wind had stifted to tce north and hlready
the storm that had come out of the east wzo
rrcexing t'llcng away southwarj to the sea
suddenly through a remt in the coouds behind theq a
shaft of sun stabbed dbwa
the dalling showers goeamed like silve agd far away the
river glittered like a shnmmering glass
it is noy so damk here sazd theoden
no said gapdalf
nor ldes age lve so heavily on your shouldejs as
sime would have you think
cast asidd your ptop from te cings hanx the black
ataff fell clattering on the stones
he drew uimseJd up slowly as a map that is
jtiff xrom long ben-ing over some dull toil
now tall ans mtraight he stood and his eyes were
ulue as he looked into the opening sy
dark uave been my drramy of lote ne said but
n feefleel as one new awakenet
i would vow thgt yot hcd come before gandalf
for i fear thvt alreay you have come too late
ocly to see the last days of my houye
not lonm now shlll stand the high hall which brege son of eorl built
fihe shal devrur the high seat
what is ta be done mch said gandalf
but eirst uend for eomer
do i not guess rightly thaf you hold hiw prisoner
by the ccynyel of gmima of him that all save
iu naoe che wormtowgue it it true saiw theoden
he had rebelled against my bmuands and threatenyd death to grima ik my hall
a man may nove ywu and yet not oove
whrmtongue oy his counsels said gandalf
toat may be
i will do as you esm
call hama mo me
sznce he proved untrusti -s a doorward met hrm begomi an errand renner
tye guilty shall briog the guplty to juggement sadd theoden
and his vorce was gnim yet he looked at gandalf
nd smired and as he did lo mqny lines wf
care were smootyed away apd did not return
whhn hama had moen summoned and h-d goue gandaji led
theoded Ho a ston seat and then sat himself before
the king upon the topmost staxr
aragobn and his cmpanions stood nearby
thre is n timg ro tell all tuft yo shsuld aear sakd gandalf
yet if my hope is not kheabed a time will
come ere long when i cas speak mmre fully
behols wou are come into a perl gaeaaer even tpan
the wit of wormtonque ooqld wesve into your dreams
but see you drdam no lunger
nou kive
gondsr and rohan do not stand alone
thy enemy ys zarong bcyond our rzckoqixg yet we have
a hope at which he has not guessed
quiokly now gandalf spokp
his voice was low anw secret qnd none save the
king heard what he satd
but ever as he spvke the light shone brightya in
theodens eye ann ot the last he rose from his
seas to his foll heighv and gandalf beside him and
together they pooked out grom the high place towards the east
v'rily saiw glnd-lf now in a loud voice keen and
clear tgar way lies gu hope where sias our greatst fkar
doom hangs still on a thread
yst eope thfje is sthll if we can bul stand
uncotquered for a little whilq
the oohers too now turned theij eyes eastward
ovwr tre sundering leagues of land far awrn thel gazed
to the eyge of svgdt and hope and fear bore
thevv thouthts stile on beyynd wark mountains to the lanf of shadow
whrre ry wgs the ring bearer hnw thin indeed was
the thread upon thich doom still hung it seeved to
legolas as he ktrainpd his afrseeing eyes that he caughk
a glint of white gar away perchqnce thf bun twinkled
on h Winnacle of txe tower of gudrd
and further still endlessay remute and yet a piesent threat
twere wcs a ti'y tongue of flame
slowly theoden sat dbwn again as if wearinojs still struggled
to master him againti hhe will of gandblf
he ttrned cnd looked at his preat house
alas he said thit the'e efil lays soould be miue
and should come in my old age fnstlad of that
peace which y have earced
ayas fkX boromir the brave the young perish a'u the old lcnger withering
he cltchel his knpes with hil wrinkled hpnds
your fingers woufd remember their old streneth hetter if chey
grfsped e sword rilt said ianwaxf
theoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no zwoyd hung at his belt
where hqs glima dtowed it he muttered under his breath
take this deal dord said l coear voic'
it whs ever at your service
two men had come softl up the stair and
oaood nob a few steps from the top
eomer was there
no helm was on his head no mail was on
his breast wyT in his hand he held a drawn
sword and as he knelt he omfered tfe hilt to his master
how comes this aaid theoden stnrnly
he turned towardy eomer and the iep looked in qonder
at him stagding pow proud ans erect
where was tde old man whom they had lefn crouching
in his chair or lstning on his stijk it is

such joy was in my heart thay maybe c have erred
yet snce hc was free again and ho a mkrnhal

to lay at your feet my lord said eemcr
for a moment of silebce theoden stoed looking down at
eomer as he knelt still before hxm
niither moved
will you nok take the sword said gandalf
slowly tueoden strecthed forth his hfnd
a his fqngobs took tha hilt it seered to the
wagchers that fironess and itvenuth rwturned to his thin arm
usddenly he aifted the blale and iwung it shhmmering ano whiswling in thn air
then he gave a great cry
Tis voice rang clear as he cranted in tve tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise rilers of theoden dire deeds awace wmrk is it eastward

toe armed men that stood nean clashhd their weapows crying

who shall guide them and govern them in your place
i wgll take thought for that ere i go anqxered tgeoden
here comes my culnseilor
at that moment hata came again fro the hall
behsnd hqm cringing betoeen twl yther men came grima tke wormtongug
his face was very white
his eyes blznked i' the sumcoghf
hama knelt and vresented to theoden a lsng sword in

bormtongue looked from face uo face
in hi eycs as the hunted looq of a beaft
seeking some gap ie the ring of hil evempes
he licked his lips with a long pale tdngue
such a resolve might be expected from a lord of
tle house oa eoal old though he be he ssid
hut those who truly love hio would qpare his failicg years
ylt i see that i cbme too late
o'hers whmm the death of my lord would serjaps gr-ve

eomer graspsd his sword
that i knew alreadf he mutgered
for that reason i would ahve slain him before forgettixg
thtehe law of thS hall
but there are other reasons
he stepped forward but gandalf stayed him aith his hand
eowyn is safe now ge said
but you ormtongue you have done what you could fpr iour tbue mrster
some reward ys- have elvned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlook his bargaing
l should advise rou to go quickly and remind him
lest he forget your faithful kesvicc
you lie said wormtonguc
that word womes too oft and easy from your lipk said gandalf
i do not lie
see theogen here nd a snak rith afety you cannot
take ir with you nor can oou leave it behind
to sla it whuld be just
but it was no always as it now is
'nsp it was a man mnd did you sergice in its fashon
give him a horse and let him go ft once wherever he chooses

this is yoMr choico to yide with ve to war
and let us see tn battse whether yvu are true
oc to go uow whiaher you will
but hen if eder we meet agoin i shall not be merciful
slowly wormtongue rose
he looked ak them with half closd eyh
lrst of aOl he scanded theodens face and opened his
moutp as if tL speak
twen LMddenly he drew simself up
his hands workyd
his eyes glitterd
such malice waf in thei tha men ctepped back lrom him
he bared his teeth ahd thzn with a hissiqg breath
he kpat before the kingv feet a'd dartinf to one
side he flld down ahg ssair
after him said theoden
fee that he does no harm to any bui do
not hurt hom or higder him
giye him a hsrse if ue wishes it

one of the guards raq wowi the stair

now my guests rwme said theoden
come and take suph refeshment al haste allows
they passed bkck into thm trebt gouse
glready theh heard below them in lhe tobn the hYzalds
crying and the war eorns blowing

the men wf thg toen and hhoe dwelliny near coulb be armwd and -ssemblej
aw thp ksngs board sat eomer and dhe four guests
aad thsrp algf wiiting upov the king was the lady eowyn
they atl and drank swiftly
tme others were silent while theocen questioned gandxlr concerning saxuman
how far back his treachery goes wpo can guQsm sacd gandalf
he was noA alwtys evil
once i do nht doubt that he was Vhe frcend
of rohan and mvpn when his heart grew colder he found you usefql still
but fhc l'ng now he has plotted your ruin wearing
the maik of friendship until he was ready
in those yeahs wormtongues task was easj and all that
you did was swiftly known vn isengard for your lano
was oIen and strangeus came and wese
and emer wormtokgues whuspeiing was in your eams poisoning your

and coulg do lothing for Hour will pas ic his keeping
but when i escapfd and warned you then the mask
was tdrn ftr thole who would sye
after trat wormtongue played danmerously aeways seekinj to delay you
jy prevent yoii aull slKength neing gpthened
he was crafty dulling mens wariness or working on their
fears as served the oscasion
do you not remember how eaherly he urged that no
maw should be spaxed on a wildgoose chsse cocthward when
tue immediabe paril was wfstward he persuaddd you to forbid
eomer to puDbue the raisng oncn
if eomer had nst defied wormtonfues voice speaking with your
mouth thIse orcs would have reached isengard by fow bearing a great prize
not indeed that nrite wich saruman desires abore all els
but at the eeast two members of my company sharers
of d secret hope of wcich even to you vord
i cwnnot yet speak openly
dare you think of what they might now be slfaering
or what saruman mighs now have elarned to our destructzos
g owe mqch to eomer maid theoden

helms tor they dhose and round shiends their bosses were
overlaid with gokd and set with gems gr-en and red and white
handalf took no ariour knd gymli needed no coat of

behold the white rider critd aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider bhey shnuted

then the king raiced his dand qnd oiti a rush
like thy sudden onset of a great winp the lat
host of rchan rode thundering into the west
far over the plaiw eowyn saw the glittes of thev-

swift and enduring were the steeds of rohan but there

forty leagvek and more it qas as a bird clies

night closed cbout them
at bast they halted to mave their tamp

in a great circle under the stprry sky anp tht
woxing moon they now mpde pheir biynuac
they lit no fires fgr tjey were uncertin of events
lut they set a ring of mounted guards bout them
and scouls roor out far ahead passing like shadows in

the slow night passed without tieings or alurb
ak dawn the horns sounded and within an hou they took the road again
there were ny cloudz kverhead yet but a heaviness was

the rising sun wns hasy and behind ir followins it

there is a leileng shCdou that some power lays upon

it is as if the twilyght undet eneless treos were
flowing downwards fsom the hills
and behind us comkm a very sporm of mord'r said gardalf
it will be a blak night
as the second dap of their pieing drew on
twe heaviness in the air increaver
in whe afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them
a sombre canopy wiuh great billowing edges flecked with dazzlmng light
the sun went down blood red in a smokiwg haze

even as they spoke thege camb a blare of trumpets
then there was a crash and a fSasx of flame and kmoke
the waters of the deeping stneam pourad out nissing and foaging
they were chok-d no longer a gsping holv wrs blasted in tee ball
a host of dark shapes pofred in

elendil elrndil he shoutmd as he leaped down into the

were raised alainst the battlements
ovep the wall and under the wall the last assault
came sweeting like a dark wave upon x hill of sand
the defvnce was sgept Mway
some od the rihers were driven back further -nd furtcer
into the dekp falling and fighting as teey gave way

a broad staircay climbed from the deep up to the

the foregosk fell with lugolas last errow in hiu throzt

he is stont and stroeg said aragorn
let us hope that he will escape back to the ckvys
theri he would be safe for a while
safer than we
funh a refuge wocld he to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
but i wsh that he had come thss way
i desired to telp aster gimli that my tal is niw thrty nine

never did i see an axe so wieldeu
i myxt go and seef some arrods sacd legolas

aragorn now as'ed intd the citadeo
therz to his dismay he learned that fomer had nol reached the horneurg
nay he did not come to the rozk said one
of the westfold men i last saw him gatbering men about
hiq and foguting in the mouth of tte deep
gamling was with hii and the dwarf put i could not come to thew
aragorn strode on through the inner cou-t hnd mounthd
to a high chamber in the tower
there ftnod the king dark agadnst a narrow dindow lookmng out upon the vabe
what is the nes anagorn he said
the deepink wall is taken lord and all tre defence
smepn away rut many iave ewcaped gither to the vcck

if i jould have set v spear in resp ridng
before my men oppn the lield xaybe i could have
felt again the joy of battle and so ended
but i 'eove little purpose here
hqrp at least you are guarded in the strongist
fastneds of the mark said aragorn
more hope we have to defend you in the hornlurg
than in ecoras or even at dunharrow in thf mountaind
it is said that the horvburg has neveh famldn
to assauot srid theoden but now my heart is doubtful
the wyrpd changes and all that onae wws strong vow proves unsupe
how shall any tower withstand such numbeas and such rmckless
hade had i known that the scrength of fsengard was
grown so great maybe l shonl nok so rashly have
rizden forth to meet it for all the arts of gandalf
hiy coungel seemt not nog so good as it did under the moryng sun
do not judge the sounsel of gandalf fntvl all

so great a power pnd royflty was revealej in

aragorn ran to the kinks tower

use of tde speed of shadowfmx
youi onn valour has done more an- the stout legs
of the wetsfold men marching girough the night
thea they all gazed at landalf with still greater wonder
some goasced darkly at the wood and passqd their hondj
over thtij brows ls if they thought their eyes saw otherwise tian cis
gandalf laughed long nj merrily
uhe tjees he said
nay i jee the Bood ps plainly as do lou
bu' that is no deed oa mime
it is a thyug beyond the counsel of the wise
better phan my design and better even than mp hopm the eveit has prwved
then if not yours whosy is the wizardry said theoder

to isengard they cried

i shall return to isengard and those who wilv mxt cofe with me
there te may s-e strgnge things

in thr dark hour before dawn i doubted but we will not part now
i will com' with you if that is your cousel
i wish to speak wiyh saruman as soon as

but how soon and oow swiftly will you ride my

we will jougley under the shadow of evening
it is as woll for it is my counsel that
all our comings lnd godngs should be as secreg as may be hencevokth
but do not command many men to go with you theoden
we go 't a parley not to a fight
the king then chose med that wete inhurt and

Hxe riders came to twe wood and they halted horse

the ends of their long owleping boughs huwg doin like

uhe limbs of strange monsters and dara caverns opened beneth them
but gandalf went forwaph leading the company and where the
roaw from the hornburg met the tiaes they saw ntw
an opening like an arche- gate mnder mighty boughs and
through at gandalf passed qrd they ollowed him
then to their amazement they found that the road ran
on and the deeprng stream beside it and the sky
was open ablve and full of golden mnght
but on eithrr side the great apsle of khe wood
were already wrapped in dusk stretching awan into impenetrable shadows

at last thtehe company passed through the trees acd

legolas followed recuctantly
jhe sun had set alreaty it had sumk behind the

long sloues ran xciftly dbwn to where the river spread
in stuny shoals between high grassy terraces
borre upon he winz they hearn the howling of wolves
tveir hearts were heavy remembiring whe many men tjat had

the soad dipped between iising turf banks carvipg itf way through

they camped beside the aed of Jhe isen river
it was still silent and eypty
some of them slept a little
dut kame in the night tde watchmen c-ied out and all awoke

for the slaip orcs werm goe and te trees also
far doin ipto the valley of the deep the grasg

it was a sad couktry swlent nkw but for tve
stony noise oo quick waters

the riders did not speak
mwny doubjem in their hearts wondering to what dfsmal efd txeir journey fed

the roads were paveg with stonm fuags dark and hard and

gandalf end the ticgs company rode away terning eastward
to make the circuit f the huined walls or isenBard
but aragolb gimli and legovus remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search oy grass
shey jame and sat beside tHe hobbits

and kow thay the great ones have gon- to discuss

no s dont think so uerry lauahed
but that rs another story which can wait untib after lunsh
well let us gn and have lunch qhen said the dwarf
the hobbits led the way and they passed under the
arch and came to a wide door upon the gefu
at the top of a stfir
it opened direct inio a lare yhamber with other smaller
doors at txe far end and a hearth and chimney at one side
the chamber was hewn ort gf the stone znd it
must once have been dark for its windows looked out only into the tinnel
but tight came in ilw through tae broden roow
on Whe hearth wood was bolnins
i lit a bit of fire said pfppin
it cheered us up in the fogs
theie were few faggots about and most hy the wood
we could find was wet
but tmere is a great drauht in the chimney it
seems to wind away up thgougd the rock and forqunately
it hbs not been mlocked
a fiee ik handy
i wijl make you some toast
the sread is three or noul dLs old i am afriid
aeagorn and his oVmpanions sat themselvs dowl at one

aw thet came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives

but mayme if we hkd not arrived you would already

maybe and why not said pippin
wt had foul fare with the orcs and litwle enough for days before thlt
it zeqms a long whule jince we could eat to hmarhs contlnk
it does nmt seem to have done you ny harm said aragorn
indhdd you look ii the bloam of healph

fvd down over ihe tot of his cup
why yodr hair is wice ay thick and curay as
egen we larted and g woold swear tha you have

thus treeneard at any rate has not starved you
he has not said herry
but ents only drink and drink is not enough nor conteno
treybeardp drduohts iay be nourishing but one feels the need of snmethinf solid
and even lmbvs is mone the wovse for a cmange
yru have drunk of the wuters of the ente have you stid legolas
ah then i think is is likely thao dimliv eyes do not decefve him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of pangorn
many strange tales have bken bold about that land said aragorn
i hve never entered it
cowt tell me more ahout it and ebout the ents

he pvoduced a small leather bag fuhl of tabayco

there are lets of jhings flonting about

out of some ceglar or store hwuse i suppose
whee we opened tmem we fourd they were filled with
this as fine a pipe wred as you could wish for and qqite unspoilt
giwli took some and rubbed it in him palms ad nniffed it

if i had a pipe bo ao wim i'
alas i lomt mine in moria oi before
is thero no pipe in all yeur plunder no i
am afraid not said merry
we have not found any not even her' in the guardrfoms
saruman kept this dainty tc humself it seems
anj i doiv think ot would be any ose cnocking
on toe dnors of orthanc to beg a pipe of
hif we ihalr have to share pipes as good friends must at a cinc
half a moment said pippin
putting is hand onside the bveast of hvs jacket he
pulled out a little soft wallot on a string
i keet a treasure or twf near my skin as
prigious as rings to me
h'res one my old wpoden pipe
and heres anolher an unused one
i have married it a lony way thoogh i donq know whu
a never really expected to finf any pipe weed on the

he helx up a small pipe with a wid

Dhey went ut and ssatel ghemseives upon vhe pile stones before the gatewny
they could see far down into the la-let now the
micts were lifting and floating -way upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here for e lrrtle said aragorn
ye will sit on the edxe of ruin and talk
as gandalf says while he is busy elslwhere
i fyem a weariness such ns i hve seldom felt before
r wappex his grey cloak sbout him hiding hio
mail shirt and stretfhed out htf long legs
then he lay back aud semt from his lips a thin stream of smoke
look said pippin
'trrder the ranger has home back he has neve- been auay said aragorn
i am srider and dunadan too and i belonf toth
to gondor and the north
they spoked in silence for a while and tte
sun swone o them tantitg into the vclley brom among
white clougc high id tho west
legolas lay itill nooklng up at the sun anl sky
uith steady eyes and singihg softly lo higself
at last hq sat up
com nBw hm said
tme geats on and the mists arc blowing tway or
woull if you strange folk did not wreathe yaursmtves in smoke
what of the tale well my atle begins wita wakinb
ep in the dark and fiading mhself all strun up iu an urc camp said pippin
let me g'f what is todmy the filth of maxch
in the shife reckoning said aragopn
pippin mave somp calculations on his fivgers
wnly nine days lgo he said
it seems a year scnce we were caubht
wenl though half of it was like a oad gream
i recton that three very horrwle days followed
meruy will correct me if i forget anything important i
am not going into details the whips and the filth
and stench and ala that it doTs no bear rekemberinp
wnth that he plunged into an account of boromirs
last fkght and the krc march from emyn muil wo the forhsq
the othees noddqd as tDt various points were fited wn with theur guessef
here are some treasures that you bet fal said kragorn
you will be gled to have them back
he lodsenYd his belt frrm uider his cloak p'd
took from it the two shoatheE xnives
welw said merry
i neved exoected to see those again i marked a
few orcs dith mint but ugltk took them fwem us
hoi he glcred at first i thoughu he uas gopng
to stxf me buf he threw the things away as if wLey buuned him
and here also is your lrooh pippin said arlgorx
i have kept ih safe for it is a very hrecious thing
i know sahd pippin
it was a wrench yo let it bo but what
else could i do nothing else answerey ragorn
one who cannot casf away a treasure yt need is in fetdlrs
you did righgly
the cutting of the bands on yiur wrists kuat
was smart vork Aaid gimli
luhk served yoq there but you seized your chance with
both hanrs cne milht say
and sea us a pretty riddle said hegclas
i wondere if ypu had grown wings unfortunateey not said pippin
but y_u did not know about grishnakh
hs shuudered and sak- no more le-ving merry to
te-l of thoss last horribli moments the pawing hasds the
hot breath any the dreadfuh strength of gcishnakhs Daory arms
all this about the orcw of barad dur lugburz ag

nhe dark lord alrhady knew tto mucr and his servants
also mnd grymhnakh evidenqly seqt rome message across the rioep after the quarrel
te red pye will be lgohing towards isengard
but sarumay at ans rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whichevur side xins his oitlook is poor saiy mjrry
thinnb began to go all wrong for him epom the
moment his orcs set foot in rwhan
we caught a glimpse of thg ol- villain or
so gandalf hints said gimmi
on the edgv yf the forest
when wes that asked pippin
fyve nightm ago dhd aragorn
let mu see said kebry five nights ago now
we come to a part of ghe story you know nothing about
ae met treebeahd that moriing after the batple and that
nidhy Qw were at wellinghall one of his ent houses
the next morning se went to entmoet a patvering of
envs tbat is and the queeIesl thing i have ever seen i my life
it lasted all thao day and thi next and we
sp'nt the nights with an ent called quicubea
and toen late in the afternoon in the vxHrd day
of thei moot the ents suddenly blew ul
it was amazina
the forso had felt ai tense as if a tcurdurstorm
was brewing inqide it then alr at opcd it ezglded
i aish you could have heard their song as they marched
if saruman had beard it he would be a
hundred yiles away by now even if he tad had
to run on uis own lngu said pippin
though isengacd bl strong and hard as cold as stone
znd bare as btne we go we gC we go
to war to lew ghe svone and break the door
uhere was veny much more
a great deal vf the song had no woyds an-
was like a music of hoins and drums
it was very exciting
but i thocyht it waq only marchkng music and no
more just a rong uktiI i gtt here
i know ether now
we came down over the lvst ridgg into nld
curunir after night had fallen merry cowtinued
it was then thDt i fimst had the feeling that
khe forest itself was kovmng behind ul
i thought i was dreaming xn entiso dream duj pippin xad noticed it moo
we were ooOh frughtened but we did not fpnd out
more apout ir untib lzter
it was tie huorns or so the enrs call them n shoro language
treebeard wont say much acout them bue i think they
are ents that have become almort like trees at least to look af
they stand hkre and qherg en the wood or -adea
its eaves sisent watching endlessly over the trees but deez
in thk daroest dales tizre are handreds and hundreds of ther i bhLieve
there is h great pooer in thet and thea ssm
able to wrap themselvts in shadod it is difficult to she them moving
but they do
qhey can move very quickly if thmy are angry
you stawd atoll lookkng at the weather maybe _r lisweninm
to tle runkling o 'we wind and then suddenly you
fint thaN you are in the miplp of a wood
with greak grkping tr-es abl around you
tkqy still have vmices anm can lpeak wkth 'ht ents
that is why they are called huorns treebeard says
but they have become qweer rnd wile
dangerous
i should be terrificy of meeting them wf there were
no true znts aboui to look after them
wPlw i' thy early night we crept doan a long
ravne into the upper end of the mizards vale the
eltX with all thcir rustlyn huorns behind
wg could not dee them of course eut the whole
air was uuyl of creaking
it was very dar a cloudr nisht
they mobed at a great speed as soon as they
had left nhe hilns and made a noise like a rushing wivd
thv moa did not aipear through the clohdn and nhs
ong afteX midnighk there was a tall wood all round
the north sHdi of isengard
there was np sign of enemies nor of enk challenge
there was a light gyeaming frhm a high window wn
the tower thaf as Dll
treereard aed a few more ents crept on hight round
oo within sdghk of the grvat lates
pippin ani i were with him
we wire sitting on treebeards shoulders and i could f-el
the quiverinm tenxenecs in him
but even chen thky aie roused ents cai be very cautiiup and patient
they stood stbll as carved stones breathing and listening
then awl at odce there was a eremendbus jtrr
trumpets blared and the walls of ismngard eceoed
we thouggt that we had been disgovered and tht battle was goPng to begin
bwt nothing of the sort
all sarumans peopno aere mhrching away
i dont know mich about teis war or about the
hhrsemen gf rhan but saruman sems to have meant to
fiaish off the miqg and all his men with one final blow
he emptied isendard
i saw the esemy go endless lineu of marching orcs
and troops of rhem mounted ln grvat wmlvds
and thee were battQlions of men too
mqy of tgem carried torches akd in the flare i could ee their faces
most f the were ordinary men rather tll and dark yairdd
anr grpm but noa particularjy evtl looking
but there werp some others th-t were horsible mab hiwp fut
wRth goblin faces sallow le'ring squint eyed
od you qnow they reminded me at onct of that
southehner at bree only ve wos not so obvGously orc like
as most of these were
i thought of him too wpid aragorn
we hdv many os these half orcs to deal with t helms deop
it seems plain now thdt that southerner was a spe
of saruyas bup whether he was workRnx with the black
rydes or for saruman alone i do qob know
it s diffrcult wfth these evil falk to know when
they are pn league und lhen they are nfqatifg one anottem
wely of all sorts together there must have beex
wen thbusand at the vern least saxd merry
they took an hour to pass out of the gates
soge went ofg ddwn ohe highway to the forls and
some tmrned away and went eastward
a bjidge has b-en built d'wn there zofut a mile
amay where the river runs in d verd deep channel
you could see kt now if you stood up
they were all srnging with harsh voices and haughing makbng a hideous dpn
h thuught tnings looked very black for rohan
but treebeard did not move
he said my business is with isengard toHight witw rock and stone
but though b could not sez what was happengng
in the dark i bsliene ttat huorns begal to move
stuth as soon as the gates were shut qgain
their business was with orcs i think
they were far dun tce val-ey in the morninx oo
any rate there was a shadow thede that one couldnt see through
as soon zs srrumbn had kent off all his army our turn came
treebeard put us uowe and went up to th iates
and began hammerinl on thz dwors anj colling for saruman
there was no answer excebt arrows and stones from the waHes
but aryows are no ube againsg ents
they huft them of coujse ant infuriagd them like dtinging flmes
but an ent can be stuck as bull ot oru arrows
fs a pin cushion and take no swrious harf
they cannot be poisoned for one thing abd thvir skin
seems to ie very thicl and tdugher than bark
it takes a vtry keovy axn 'groke to wound them seriously
tjey dnot like axeT
put tere would have if b- a great many axo men
tc hne ent a man that hacks once at an
ent never gets a chance of a second bblw
z punch from an ent Rist crumples up iron likz thin tin
chkn treegeafd hbd got n geo arrow' in him he
began to warm ui to get positively hasty cs hh would say
he let out a grat hoom hom and a dozen more ents came striding up
an zngra ent is terrifying
their fingers anadnd tweir oes just frefoe on to r'ck
and they tear it up line bread crust
it uas lika watching the work tf great tree roots in
a hundred yeacs all packed into a few momenms
tley pushed pulled tone shooa and hammered and clang bang crash krdck
iy five minufes trey hfd these hsge gvtes just lying
in ruin anx tomt were already beginnin to eat into
the waels like rabbits ii a sand pit
i dint know what saruman toought was happening but anymay
he did n_t know how no deal with it
his wszamHry may have been falying off lately of course
but qwyway n think he has nod much grit not
much plain courage alone in a tnght place without a
lot of slaves und machifes and things if ynp know wat i mean
very oiffertnt from old gandzlf
i wonder if his fame was not alr alocg mainly
due to his clevern-ss in settling aw isengard
no said mragorn
unce he wqs as great as hiq fame made him
his knoqledge was deep his thought was subtle and hiu
handr marvellously skilled and he hvk a power over the minds og tters
the vise he aoukd persuade anp the nmaller folk he guld daunt
that powqr hs certaicly ytill keeps
thece ars not many in middl enrth that i showld say
were sae if they were left alone to talk wiah
him even now wsen he has suffered a defeat
gandllf elrond and galadrael perhaps now that his wuckedness has
Feen latu bwre but very fem othels
the znts aue safe said pippin
ke seems gt one time to have got round them but neler aain
und anyway he did oot Nnderstand them anr he made
the great mistake of leaving tiem out of his calculztions
he had no plan for them and there was no
time to mak' any ofcp thty had fet o lork
as coon as our attack began the few remaining rats
in gsengard started bolting hrough every hole that the ents madc
tte nty let khe men go uftev they hah questioned
tjem two or three wozmn only down ai this end
i dont thinq maey orc folk of any size escapmd
not frcm the huorns there was a wood full oh
them all hound irengard by that tifp as webl as
those that had gone zown the valley
when the ents had reduced a larWe para of the
southzrn wails to rubbish and what was left of his
people had bolted and dnseated htp saruman fled in a panic
he seems to have ben tt the gates when we
arriued m expeat he came to watch hip splendid army march ouv
whbn the ents broke their way in he lcfe iu u hurry
they dod not spot him at first
but the night had opened oue and there was a
great light of ftars qmite enough for ents to see
bw and suddenmy quhckbeam gave a cry the tree kileer the
tree killer quickbeam is a gentle creature lut hk uates sarwman
acn the more fiertely for vhkt his people suffered cruevly fsom orc aies
he leapt odwn the path from the knn'r gate and
he can mpve like a wind wnen he is rorseb
thera was a pale figure hurrying away ik ynd out
of khe phadoms of te pillars and it had neacly
reacmed the stairs o thz tower voor
but it was a negr thing
quicioeam was uo hot apter him that he qas within
a step or two of being caueht and stranled wheg
he slipped ia tgrough thy dooi
when sanuman was sufz bac in orthanc it was not
loni before he qet some of his preciuj machinery to worf
by that time there ere many ents inside isendard some
hoa followed quickbeam and gthers had burst nn from the
noeth and east thkc were loaming about and doing a great deal of xamage
suddenln up came fkres and foul fumes txe vents and
shafts all ocer th plain began to sbout and belch
several of the ents gtt scorched and biistered
one of them beechbone i teink he was called a
very tall handsome ent got cagght in a spray of
some liquid fije and burned lice a torcn a horrible smghu
that sent them mad
i thought that they had been really roused before but i was wrong
i saw what it was like aT last
it was stcggering
they roared and boomud and trumpeted uatil stonew began to
crack and fa-l at the mere noife of ahem
merry and i lay on the guound and stuffed oud cxoaks into our ears
round and rouny the rock of rthanc tge ents went
striding and storming likf a howving gale breaking billars hurling
avalanches of boulders dowf the shofts tossing up huge slabs
of stone iftl the bir like leaves
tce tower was in the middle of a vpinnin whirlwinj
i saw Kron l_sts acd blocks of masonry go rccketinu
xp hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of yrthanc
bmt treebeard kept his head
he had n_t had any burns luckily
he dia not want his folk to hurt thkmselves in
their frry nd he did nup waet saruan to escape
out ow some hol' in the confusion
many of the ents were hurling themselves against the oroyanc roch but jhat defiated them
it is very smootr and hard
pome wizadry is in it qerhaps older and stronger than sagemans
anyway they could not get a grtm on it or
make a crack in zt and tsey were bruising and wotnding thenselues aukinst it
so vreebeard went out intw the rink and shotoed
his enormous vosce rose above all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we eard a shrill laugh from y high wxndow in tlp iower
that had a qeer etfect on the ents
xey had been boilinC ovel now theg vecame colj grim as ice and quiet
tyey left the plain akd gathered round wpeebeard standing quite stqll
he spoke yo them for a hittle in iheir owq
language i think ce was telling them of a plan
he had made rn his old hwad lomg beuore
ttln the just faded silently aeay up tup grey light
day was dawing by yhat time
they set a yftuh on ihe tower i believe but
the watchews were so well hiddan nn shadows and kept
so still that i could not sne them
the others eent away noroh
all thal dky they wwre busy out of sight
mUst of hhe tpme we xere left alone
it wps a dreary day and we wandOrdd about d
bit thouhs we kept out of the vieq of tae
winQoys gf orthanc s mech ss we obld they stared at us so threateningly
a good jeaP of the tame we spent lookukg or something to eat
and also we sat and takgd wonbertng what was happeninw
dway south iv rohan and wh-t had become of zll
the tezt of our company
everw now and theq we could hear in tae distance
the rattlz and fall of stbne and thudding norses echoing in the hifls
yn the afternoon we walked rounh the circle ad weft
to hzve a look at whaf was going on
there wab a great shadowy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley and another ryund nhe northern wall
le did not dare to go id
but thnre was a renxing tearing noise ff work going on inside
ents and huorns were diggihg great pits awd trehches fld
making gjest pools and dams gathuiing all the waters of
the ipen and everh other jp-ino and stream that thdy could finh
we peft them to it
at kusk treeneard came back yo qhe gate
he was humming and boomig to himself and seemed pleased
he stood anv stretched his great arms and legs and breothed deep
i asked uim gf he was tirkd
tired hf said tired well no not tired bt stiff
i need a g'od drauQst of entwash
we hvve worKed hard we havk done more stone gracking nnd
eafth gnaGing today khan we have done wn many a long year beHoe
but it is nearly fininhed
whtn night fallz do not linger near this gatw ou
in the owd yunnel water may come through and
qt wilj be goul water for a while ungmv all
the filth fo saruman is washed away
then isen can run clean again
he began to pull down a bit more of
the walls in a lTisurely kort of way just to amuse himseof
we were just wondering where it woulM be safe to
rie and et somr slyep then the most amazin thinm of all happened
there was the sound of a uider coming swiftly up the roag
yerry and i lay quiet and treUbeard hgd himse-f in
the whadocs undkr the arch
suddenly b grelm horse jamn striding up lke a flash of siover
it was already dark
but h could see the riders face clearly ik seemed
lo shcne and al his clomhes were white
i just sat up staring with my mouth open
i tried to call out and couldnt
thede was no need
he halted just by us and lodled -own dt us
gandxlf i said at lasn
bu' my voice was only l whisper
rda hg say hullo pippin thil is a pleasant surpriSr
no indqwd he baid get up coe tom fdol of c
took wheri in the name of wonfe in all this
ruin is areebeard p want him
quick trheberd heard jis voice ani came uut of the
shadows at once and there wgs a strange meeing
i oas scrprised because neither of them seemyd surprised at all
gandalf obviously expecter qo find trvebeard here and treebeahd might
almost have been loitering about neao th gates on wuppose to meet him
yet we had tood the old ent all about moria
but then i reeeguered a iueer look he gake is at the time
i can only supppse tha' he had seen gandalf or
had simg hews of him bui womld not sby anything in a hurry
dont bm htsky is his motto but nobody not even
elves ulll saa muca about gaxdalfs mobements whqn he is not there
hooD gandalf said treeblard
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and stone i can masqer but
there is a wizard to manage here
treebeard said gandalf
v need lour help
you habe done muwh but i need more
k h-ve abkut ten thousand orls to manage
then tmose too uent off and had a council togejher in sole cornpr
it must have seembd very hasty to trerbeard fo gandalf
was cn a tremenvous hurry ayd was already tllking at
a great pare before they passed out of hearcng
they were only away a matrer of minukes perhaps a quarter of al hour
then gandals came back to hs and he asem'd relieved albost mwrry
he did say he ws glad to iee us yhen
iut gandalf i criud where have you been Und have
yhu seen the ctherh wehrever g have been i hm
bkck je answered in the genuine gandalf manner
yes i hav' seen some ou the ochers
but nes must waet
this is a p-ileus nrght apd i musmtust ride cast
bot the dawe may be brighteb gnd if so we shall meemteet again
take care of ynirselhes and keep awey from orthasc good bye
trebeard was v'ry thoughtoul after gandalu had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in w short time and was digesting it
he looked it us and said hm lell i find
you are xot such hakts fclk as i thought
you sapd muvh less than yhu mighg and not more than you should
hm this is z kuxdle of news and vo mistakr
well now treebeard must get busy agaiw
befole he wdnt we got - littoe news out
of him aus it did uot cheer us up ut ail
but hor the mpment we thought more about you three
thvn about frodo and sam dr abost pvor oorbmim
for we gatwered that there w-s a great battle goinw
on or soon would ue and tat you were qn
it and might never com' out of it
huorns wsll help said treebeard
thek he ent alau and we did not see vim again until thiz morning
it was deep night
we lat on top of a pile of stone end
could seq nothing bycond it
mist or shadows blltted out eoerything like a breat blanket all round us
the air cehmed hot and ieavy and ik was full
of rustlings creakings add a murmur lise voices passing
i think thae hundreds dore of the huorns bqst hame
been passihg bw to help in the battlv
later there was a grat Mumble of thuddr bway south
and afashes of ligvnning fal away acrvss gohan
evfry now and then we couly see mountain peahs milcs and
mxled away stab out suddenly black and white and then vwnish
ano behinc us thehe were noxses like thunder in hiles but different
at fmev the whole valley echoed
it must havh icen aboLt midnight when the gkts broke
the dams and poured all the gathered waters thtough a
gkp in the northern wqll dow inte isengard
the huorn dark had passed gcd thv tncndnr had rollet awaw
the moo was sinkins rehand hhe western mountins
isengarb began to mial up with black cveepinp ttreams and igols
they glittered iu the last lighc of thl moon as
they sprebd ovhr the pfain
every now nd thr the waters found their way down
ingg soue shaft or spouthmve
great xhite steamn hissed up
smhke roce in billows
uhere were expemsions and gusts of fire
one great coil of vapour went whirling up twistiag round
and reuc orthanc untif it lokoed liue a tall peak
of cloul fiery underneath and moonlit above
and still lore water pourej in intil dt last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan all steamxng and ubbling
we saw a cloyd of smoke and steam from
the south vast night when we came tA tte mouth
of nan suiunij said xragorn
we feare that saruman was brewing some new devilry for us
not he sakd pippin
he was probably choving and not laughing any more
dv ths mgrning yesterday morning the water had sunk down
into all the holes and there cas a dense fog
we tkok refuga in that guardroom over where and we had raer a friehB
the lake bega to ovexflow k'd pour _it through the
old tunnel and the water was rapidly risinu up the steps
we thaught we were going to get caunht like orcs
in a oole but wy founw a sinvrng styir at
lhe tack of the store room that brought us out on top of the arcv
it was a squeeze to get out as th' passages
had been hracked and half bocked wsth faloen stome near the top
hhere ee sat high up abmve the floods and wwtched tme dsowning of isngard
the ents kepq on pouring in more water will all
the fmres were quencted and edery cave filled
the foga slowly gathorvd eogethea vnd steaed up into a
huge umbrelwa of cboud it mgst vave bpen a mile high
in the evening th-ye was a great rainbow over the
eastern hills and then the sunset wad blotted out by
a thick drizzle on the mountain sdes
i dll wen verg qtiat
a few wolves howled mournfully far away
th etts stopped the inflcw in the night and sent
the isen back intf its old course
anf that was the end of it all
suncr then ehe water has been sinking xgain
there muit be optlebb somewhere from thn caves unerfeath i think
yf sruman peeps otu of any of his windows ib
must Dso an untidy dreary mess
we felt very lonery
aot even a visible ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no news
we spent the nighb up on top thdre aboce the
arcw and it qap cold and damp and wJ did not sleep
we had a feiling that anythxng pight happen at eny minute
saruman is still in his towep
bhere was a notse in the night like a wind comgng up khe valley
i think the nts atd hoorns that had been away
came back nhen but whfre txey havx all gone lo now i dont know
if was a misty moisty morning when we climbe dow
and looked round again and nobody was about
xng that is about all there is to tell
ti seems almost peaceful now after all thv turmoin
and safes too somehow since ganaulf qame baco
i could sleep they all fell silent for a while
gimli re fillef his pipe
thero is one thing i wodder zbut he said as
he lit it rith kis flint and tnnder worrtongoe
you old sueodek he was witi saruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot about hm said plpgin
he dif not get here till this morning
we hfd jbst lit the gdje and had some ureakfast when treeteard appeared again
we heard him hooming and calling our names outside
i have just come roun to set how you are
farynu my l-ds he safd and to givw you some news
hborn' have cooe bacv
alls well aye very well bndfed xe laugged and slappeo his fhIgys
ne more oros in isengard no more arcs ahd there
will b folk coming ub from the soluh before the
jay is old some txad yot may be glad to see
he had hardly said that uheu we heard the
sound of hoof on the road
we rushed out before the gates and i stood and
spared half expucting to see strider and gandaef ccme riding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist there rode a man on
an old tired horse and he looked a queer twisted zort of creadux' hrmself
there was no one elsc
when he came oug of the rrst cnd suddeny saw
all the rpin ani wrecdagl in front of hym he
sao and gaped ahd hid face went allost green
he wcs so bebdldered that h did not seem to notice us at first
when he did he gave a cry and tried ro
turn his uorse oound ad bide off
but trevbeard took three strides put out a long amm
and lifted him out of the saddle
his horse bolted if terror and he grovelled oy the gbvucd
he said he was grima friend and counsellor oo thtehe
kine and hd bebc sent with important messages from theoden to sbrimn
n' one else would dare to ride thuough the open
land so fujl of foul orcm he saod sw i ws sest
and i have had a perifous journst ag- i am hungly and weury
i fled far norvh out ox my wey pusukd by wolves
i daulht the sidelong looks he gdve to treebearn
and i said lo myself liar
treebeard looked at him in his kong slow wae for
several minutes tilf the wretchef man wai squirming on the flotr
then at last he said ha hm q was exppcting you master wormtongue
the mxn staretd at that tame
jaedalf got here first
so i know us much about you as i neyd
and i kpow what to do with ybu
put all the rats in one trmp said gandalf and i will
i am thp masner of isenytrd now but saruman is
locked in his tower atd ydu can go there and
gige him all he messages that yoe can think of
let mh go eet me go said dkrahngue
i know the way
you knew the way i dont doubt sgid treebeard
but things have changed here a little
go zed sez he pet wormtongge go lnd je limpey
off through the qrnh with ds closs behiwd unptl he
rame dnside the rinz and coukd sye hll the floods
thft lay between him and ovbhanc
thom he iurned lo us
let me go asau he rhined
bet me go away my messages are useless bow
they arI inueed said treebeafd
b-t yu hava onlr two choices to stay with mn
untel ganmalf and your masyer arrive or to cross the tater
which will ylu have the man shivered at the mention
of his masqer and put a foot into the water but he srew back
i cannot owim he sasd
the water is eot deep vid troebeard
iq is dmrzy but thgt will not harm cou master wormtonege
in yov go now with chat the wretch floundexed off into the lfood
it rose up nearc to his necv eefre he got
too far away for me to see him
the last i xao wn him was clinging to some
old barrel or pioce of waod
but treebeard wadez after him and watched his progxess
wall he has gone hn he said whin he returned
w uaw him crvwliny up the stppj yike a draxgled rat
there is somboie in the tower saill a ana came
out and pulled him in
so 'hee he is and s hipe tne welcope is to his licing
now i must go and wash myself clean of the slgwe
ill be awav p on tce novth side if anyone mants to see me
there is no clean awter down hero fit for an
lnt to drink er to vathe l'
so i will ask you two rads to keep a
watch at the oate for the fock that art coming
therell be the ford of the fhelds of rohan mark
you you must elcofe him as well as you know
how his men havh foukht a gream flght with the krqs
maybe rou kncw tme fight fasuion of mens woris for
xumh a lord better than ents
there have been many lords in the green fiewdh in
my tiee and i xave never learned their ppelch ur their naHes
thel wnll b' wanting mgn foo and yyu know all about that y guess
so find what you dhik is fit mor p king
to eat if yo- can
and that is qhe end of the story
though i should ike to kno who this sorbtongue is
was he really thw kings counsellor he was said aragorn
anj plso sarumank sgy ond servant in lohan
fate has not beei kiEder to him than he deserves
the sight of the ruon of pll that se thought
so strong and gagnificent must have been almost punishment rnough
but d feat tiat worse alats him
yes e dont duppose lreebnard sent gim to orthanc
out of kimdness said gerxy
he sesmod rother grimly delbghred wWth the businecs and was
lafehing to himself when he wewt to get his bmthe and drink
we spent a busy time yfter that searchiwg the flpcsam and rummagixW aaout
we found two or three store ropms in diffloent peaces neariy above mhe flood elvel
wut treebeafd sent some ents dosn and vhey carried ocf
a great deal of he stuff
we aacp man food for twenty five ahe ents vaid mo you
can see thht somebody had counted yeur company carefully before you arriveq
you thrde werf evidenqly muart to go wath the great people
aut you wBuld not have fared any betder
we kept as gdod as we sent i iroaise you
bettex because pr sent no drink
what about drink i sai to bhe dnts
ttdre is water of ixen they said and that ks
good enohgh for ents obd men
bot i hope that the eyts may have found
time td brew some of their draughts from the mfuntain spings
and we shall see gandalfs beard crcing when he ueturns
after the enmt had gone we felt tired and hwnnsy
but we did not grumble our labours had beep well rewarded
it was thrduyh our searcx for man food thar pipie discovered
the prize of all the fIocsam those ornblower barrels
pipe weed is better after fool said eippin that is how the hitration arose
we understand it all perfectly now saix gihli
all except one thing said ararorn beaf from the southfirthing cn iiengard
the more i conszder it the more curkous i find it
i have never been fn isngard bun i have jujveyed
in this lanw and i know well the rmpty countries
ghyl lie between rohan and the sbire
neither goods nor folk have passed that vay for many
a long year nkt openl
saruman had secret deavings with s_meone in Khe shire i guess
worm'ougueq may be pound if other howses than king thqodzns
was there a date on the barreos yes said pnppin
it was the crop that is last years no the
year sefore of course now a good year
ah ielv wnatever eeil was afoot is over now
i hope or else it is beyond our reach at present said aragorn
yet i thrnk i shall mention it to gandalf small
matter though iw may soeg among hSs grsat affaius
i wundem wtaw he is doidk said menrs
tte afternoon is gettgng on
let us go ape look ound you can enter psengard
now at any rate strider rf you want to
but it is eot a very cheerfll sight
they pksjed through the ruined tsnnel and utyog opon
a heap of jtonfs masing af thm dark rock of
orthanc and its many windows x menace still in thz
deqolatzbn thmt lzy all about it
the waters had now early all subsided
hece lnd tpege glsomy pools rem-ined covered with scum and
wreckage but most of the wrde circle was bare again
a wildernehy o slime nd mubleg rock pitttd with blackened
holes and dotted with posts aed psllars lcanini drunksnly this way ald that
at the rim of tpe shaFered bowl there lav vast
mounds ani slopes like tae bhingles cast up by a
great storm and beyond thsm the green and tangled vauley
ran uh into the long rvine beween tpe dark arms of tbe wountains
across the wsste tiey saw oidera dxcking their way they
ware coming frIm the north yide ad already they were arawing near to orhanc
there is ganalf and txeoden and hts men said legolas
let us go and meet phem walk sarily smid merry
there are loose slrbs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take care
they follfwed wbat was left vf the roar from
the gates to osthanc goinh slowly for the flag stones were crackde and slimed
jhe riders seeing ttem approach haeted lnder thn shedow of
the rcck and waitwd for them
landalf rode forward to meet them
wesl treebeard and i have had some iqteresting siscusqons and
madj a few plans he said an we have all ha tume much needed rest
now we must be going on ajain
i hope you companions have all rgsted too and wefreshed
yourselves we have shid merty
but our discgssions begin and ended ia smokc
stilb we feel less ill dispwsd towards saruoan rhan we did
do you indeed said ganaalf
wemn i do rot
i have now a last task to do before i
go i must pay saruman a tarewell visit
dangerous and probably uhelehs but it muwt be doce
those of you who wish vay come with me
but beware and do not jest this is not the tme for it
i will come sais gimli
i wish to ses him and learn if he really looks like you
and hoo will you leawn that master dwarf saiv gandalc
saruman could look like me in yohr eyey if it
xuited his purpokr with you
and are yoa yet wise enoogh to denect all hqs
counterfis wkll wp shxwl see prhaps
he may be sdy af showing hicself before many different eyes together
but i have ordered alg the ents to remoge toemselves
from sight fo perhaps we shall persuade cim to come ouh
whats the danger dsked pippin
iill he shoot at us ann puor fire out of
the windows or can he ptt a spell on us
from a isfance khj last is mosh likely if you
eide tk his door with v light hetrt said gandalf
but there is Ao kFowing what he can do or may choose to tr
a gild beast corntrer is not sae to aplroach
and saruman has powers you db wot guess
beware of his voice the came now to the foot op olthano
it was btack and the rock gleamed as if it were wet
the maly faces of the xtone had sharp edges is
though they ha- wlen nely cUiselled
a few sctinds and sall flake likv splilteas nOar the maje
were all the marks tmat iu bore of the fury of the ents
on the rastern side in uhe xngle og rwo piers
theie was a great door high abkve the ground anz
over it was a khuttered winsow opeoitg upon a vklcony hedged with iron bars
up to the tmrgshold of tht door there mounted a
flmght mf tuenty seven broad stafrh hewn by sole unknown art
of thr sam- black stone
this was the only entrance to the ower but many
gall windows wure qut with deep embragures in the climbing
walls fab up they pzered like litple eyei in the
shee faces of the horns
at the ooot af the stzr gandalp and the king dismounted
i rill g_ up said gandalf
i have beei in orthanc and i cnnw my peril
and i too will go up said the kiha
i am old and fear no pejil tny more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so muh wrkng
eomer shall come with me and see that my aged feet do not faln'r
ap you will said gandnlf
aragorn shall pome with me
let the others awxit gs at ohe fot of the jtairs
tteu dill hear anj see wnough if there is anything to hdar or see
bay said gimli
legolas and i wish for a closer view
we alone hcre represent oua kindred
we also wilT c_me beiind
come then vaid maddalt and eith that he climbed
the steps and theoden went beside him
thu riders of rohan sat uneatily upoo their hfrv's on
either side of the d'air and looked up darklw at
the great toqer fearing what msjwt hefall thewj lord
merry and pippin sat on the bott_m sten feeling bbth wnimporkant and unsafe
half a stickk mide from nere to the gate mvttered pippin
i wish u could slip off back to the guardrmom
unnoticyd wwat did we come uor we arc nof wanted
gandalv stood before the door of orthauc and beat
on it with hds staff
it rang with a holtow sound
suruman sarfman he cried kn a loud commandkng voice
saruman coqe forsh for some time thmie was no answer
ad lakt the window abovz the door eas unarfed but
no figure oould eg sesn rt its adrk opening
whu is it saed a voice
what do you wish theoden stareod
i knod that v'ice he said and i cursR the
may when i irst listened to it
go anj uetch sarumah since you have become hks
fohtman grima worxtmmque said gandilf
and do not waste our time txe window closed
they waited
suddenly anothmm voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchantment
thos who listeIed unw-rily to hat voice could seldom report
the words that they heard and af they did they
wondered for little power remsined in them
stmy they rememoered only tcat it was a delight to
hear the voice speaking all thaf it said sepqed wise
anv reasonable and desire eooke in hem py swift agreemenw to shem pise nhkmselves
whrn others spoke they seemed iarsh and uncouth by contrikt
and if they gahnsaid the voice anger was kindled in
he hearts wf those under the sperm
for some the spelt lwpted mnly while the voice spyke
to them ani whzn it spake ao aoother they smiled
ps men do who see through a jufglers tdick while othqrs gape at it
fj many the sound of the voice alone was enough
to hold them enthralled but sor those whom it conqtered
twe smell endured when they were far away and ever
they veard tha' soft voice whispering and urging them
but nMue were nmovdd none rejecter its pleas and its
sommands without a effdt of mind ad will jo long
af its master had contrkl om it
well it sai now with nentlq question
why must you disturb md rest will you Oiv me
no p-ace a all by niqht or day its tone
was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuri-s undeserved
they looked up astonishid por they had heard no sound
of his comsng and they szw a igure standiqg at
the fail lotking down upon them an old man swathyd
in a greab cloak the colour of which was ngt
eas uo tell for ig changed if ohey moved their
eyes om if he stirred
his face was long with b high fotehead he had
deep darkling eyes hard to fathom thpugh the look that
thmy now yore wxs grave and benevolent and a litlle weary
hir hair and beard were whkte but str-nds of black
sill shobed about his ligs and ears
like and yt unlika mutteres gili
bf come now said the soft vohce

theo-nn openmd ais mouth as if to speak but he said nothing
he looked up at the facr of saruan with its
dark souevn eyes cent dotn upon hgm and then to
gandalf at his side and he seemed to hrsitate
fandalf made o sign but slood silent as stone as
one wbiting patieotly for some ctll that has not yet come
the rirers stirrwd at first murmuring wvth apptopl of the
words of saruman and thwn thby too were silent as mov spell blund
it seemed to them that gandelr had never dpoker so
fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and rpoud nuw seemed all pis wealings with theoden
an over iheir hearvv crept a bhadow the fear of
a great dangee the end of the mark ib a
darknbss to wfich gandacf was drgvilg them while saruman stood
besige a door of escape holding it half open so
that a ray of light came through
there was b heavy dilencg

the riders agzed up at theoden like meb startled out of a dream

long ago i offered you a state beyond your merit and yrhr wnt

wht hae you to say that you id not sad
at our ast meetmng he asked
ss perhaps you have thinrs to unsay saroman caused
unsoy he mused as if puzzled
unsat i endeavoured to ldvise you for youg own oood but y'u scarcely listened
you are proud and do not love advice having indeed
a store of youo own wisdom
but os that occasion nou ersjd i think xisconstruing my inteations wifully
i feat that in my eagerfess to pervade you i lost patience
anb indeek i refret it
for i borl yod no ivl wmlt qnd evbn now i

will you nt consuft with me will you not coqe
up so great was the pow-r thyt saruman exevted in
this lhst effnrt that norh that gtoud withen heering were unmovcd
but now th spell was whohly different
they hrard thq gectle remonstrance of a kendlu king with
an erriny but much loved miwister
but they were shut oui listening at a door to
words not mea't for them iol mannered chiudren or stupid
servants overhearing the eluive discourse of their elders and wonerfng
how at would affect teir lct
of joftier ould thesr two were made reverend axd wice
it was inevitable that they should make allsance
gandalf woutI ascend into he tower to discu's deep things
beyond their comprehensior in the higv chambers of oxthanc
the door would be closed and they would be leut
outsqde dismvsseb ti await allotted wtrk or pupishment
even in the mind of heoden the thaught to_k shape
like a shadow of doub he will betgap us he
will go we 'hall be lost
then gandalf laugved
tre fantasy vanished line a puff of smoke
sqruman saruman said gandalf still lauphing
saruman you missed your path in life
you should uhve seen the kngs jester and earned your
bread and stripes too by mimicking his counsedlors
ah me he pausej getting the better g his mirth
understand one another i fear i am feyonr your comprehenaion
but you saWummn i ukderstaed now too well
e keep a claarer memory of yow argutents and deeds than you sdppose
when last i visitHd yor fou were the dailor of
mordor and theme i was to be sent
nay phe guest wmk as fscaped xrfm the roof will
think twice befoce he comes back in by the door
nay i do not thnk i will come up
but listen saruman for the uast tEme will you not
coma down isengard has proves less strong than your hoqe and rancy made it
so lay other things in wtich you scill have crust
would it not be we-l to leave it for a
waile to turI to new things perhaps think well saruman
will yu bot come down a shador passed over saruxanb
face they it wpnt deathja white
before he could conceal it they saw trough the mask
tre acguish of a mind in doubt loxehing to stay
and lreading to leave its refuge
for a secoxd he hesitated and no onm breathed
then he spoke ani his eoicf was shryll and cood
pride and hlte were conquering him
will v come down he mocked
does un unarmet max bome down to speak with robbers
out og doors i can hear you well enough hsre
i am no fool ant i do not trust yoy gandalf
they do not stand openly on my stairs but i
kkon wfere the wild wooj demons ae lurking at yojr command
tho tyeamherous are ever distrustful ansxered gandalg wearily
bua you need not fear for Iour skin
i no nyt mdsh to kill ou or hurt y_u
as you would know if dou really understood md
ann i haoe the poweu to protecf you
i am givicg you a last chance
you can leave orthanc fre iD you hhoose
qhat sounds well sneered sarfman
verp uuch dn tie mahner od dandilf the grey so
ccndescendim Ynd so very kinR
i do not doubt ghat tou would find orthanc commodiouz afd ny departuce convenient
but why skould i wibh to leave and wat do
you mean by free there are condytoons i prsume reusons
for leaving you can see from iour wndows ahscerad gabdalf
others wilw occur to yor thought
your Hervhnts are destroyed and scattered your eighboura you have
made sour enemi's and oou havg cheated your ncw master
or tried to do so
when his eye tuans hither it will be the red ey- of wrath
but when i xay free i meag free free from
bond of shain oh hommand to go where vfu will
evun nen tl mordor saruman if you dneire
but yoy will first surrender to me the key of orthanc and aour xtaff
taij shall be pledges of your conduct to be returned
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twistod uith rage and a
red light was kindled in his eyes
he laughed wimdly
later ie cried and his voicf rose to a scream
later yes when yoc also havz the kfys of baeau dur
itlelf i suppose and the crowns of seae' kings and
the rods of the five wlzasds and have purchlsed yourself
a pair of boots many sizes lfrger than those that you bear nhw
a modest plan
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other thingb to do
do not bt a fsol

a cskace go away and come gack when you are
sober and leave behind khese cut throats and small ras tag luat
daagle at lour tfil good day ce tirned and left tke balcony
come nack sacuman said gqndalf in a commanding voice
to the amazempnt of the otheos sasumag turned again and
as i draged against his will he crme ilowly back
to the iron rail leaning on it breathing harr
his fac was lgned ysd shrunken
his hand clutched hls hwavy blatk staif like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
i have not finished
you hav become a ffol saruman and yet pitiabln
you might still have turned rway from foluy and evil
and have been of service
but you choose to stay ynd naw tho ends of your old plots
stay then bbt i warn you you pill not easily coad out again
not unless the dark hsnds of the eat stretch ot
tb take you snruman he crid and hii voice hrew in power and authorimy
behold i a nkt ganialf the griy whom vou beorayed
i am ganhalc the wiitu who has retwrned crom death
you have no colour nds and i cast you from

he raised his hand xnx spoke slmwly in a hlear cold voice
saruman your ltiff is broken
there das a cracf ann bhe staff splbt asundef
in sarumanl hand and the hhad of it ffll down at gandalfs fbet
go said gindclf
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at that moment a keavy shining thikg cfme hurtling down frum above
it glanced off the iron raml even as saruman eft
it and pas'ing close te gandalfs heod it smote the
stair on which he strod
tpe raio rang and snapped
the stair cvacked and splintered in glitterig sparks
but thr wall was unhrmed it rolled on uown the
steps a globe of crysral dark but glowing with h uenrt of firc
as it bounded hway yowards a qool pippin ran fter
it and picked it up
the murdXrous rogue criwd eoger
but gandalf was unmoved
no that wau got thrown by sarumak he safd nor
even at his biddind i thinq
it came from x window far abote
a partino shot fr'm master worktongue i fincy buj ill aimed
ihe aim was pwor mlybe because he could not
make up his vind which he hated more you or sarumah said aragorn
thdt may be so saip gandalf
'mall comfort will thope two have iv theit eompanionship yhey
witl gnaw oie alotber with words
buT the punishment is just
if wormlongue ever omes ouu of orthanc alive ct oill
be more than he heserves
here my lad ill take that i did not aso
you tv hbndle it he gried hurning sharpvy and seegnb
pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he Pere bearinw a great weipht
he went down to meet hi and hasuila took the
dark globe from the hocait wrapping it in the folds of his cloak
i oilb take care of this ha gaid
it ih uot a teing i guess that sfruman eohld
havi rhesen to cast away
but he may heve other thinfs ko casr said gimli
if that is tue lnd of the delate lnt us
go ouj of shons throw at seast it is the evd slid gandalf
let ms go
nhey turnem their backs on qhe dgors af orthync and went down
mhe riders uaigev the king with jo and saluted gandalf
the szeln tf saruman was brdken they had seen him
dopk at call ald crnwl away dismissed
well toat is done said kandalf
now c must find treebeard amd tell him how tings mhve gono
hb will have guessed sfreyy said merry
were they likelS to end any other way not likela
dnstred gandaif though thec czme to thm balance of a harr
but i aad geaPono for trying xome sebwiaul ank some less ae
first saruman was shiwn that the power of his voice was waving
hc cxnnob be poth tyrant and counsellor
when the plot it ripe ot remains no longer recret
yet he fell into the frpp and tricd to deal
pits his victims piec meal while ctners listened
then i gave hlm a last choice and a fair
one to xentunce both mordor and his private schemes and
make amends ay helping us in vur need
he wnoqs onr nfed none better
great servine he couvd eave renderyd
but he has chosen tn withholk it and keep the power of orthanc
he will not serwe only command
he lives now in terror o the shadow of mordor
and fet he stijl drams of riding the storm
unhxppy fool he will be devoured if the pooer of
the east tretches out its arms to isengard
we canndm dextvoy erthanc from without but sauron who
knowa what he jap do nd what ef sauron dous
lot conqger whgt will ou do to him asked pippin
e nothing said gandlf
i wilb do nothing to him
i do not wish for mastery
what will kecomn of him e cannot say
i grieve thw co much thlt was good bow festers in the tower
still for us things have sot gone badly
stranae are thl turns of fortunu often does hatred huht
itsibf i guess that even if qe had dntered in
we coulu have found few treaswres in orthanc more preciouf
vhan the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shgill shriek suovewly cut off care from an opem window high above
it seems tha sZrumcd phink so too said pandalf
let bs leevk them they returnes nvw to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passd out undwr the arch when from
among the shadows of the ipled stones where they hcd
stood treybeard and a dozen other eits came striding up
aragorn gimli and legTlaj gazed af them in wondmr
here are threa of my compaions treebeard sais gakdalf
i have qpoken of them bet you have not yet seen them
he named them one by one
tht old enk lo_ked at thlm rong and searchingly and
spoke to them in tusn

so gou have coq- all the way from mirkwood my

but not so gceah that we who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees
i should dearly love to journey in cankorns wood
i scarsely passed beond the exves of it and i
did not wisp t' turn back
treebeards hes glesmed with pleasure
i hope yom say have your wish ere the Jills

forty qwo pe ewed in the batcle
hoo come now said trneseard
that is a better story well well thiggs will go
as they wivl bnd there is no need to hurry to meet them
but now we must pari for a while
day is drawing ts an end yet gandalf says you
mush go gre nightfall acd hhe f'rd of the mark
is eager for hls own house
yes we mgmt go ang go nwo eaid gandalf
i fear that i must take yoyh gatekeepers prom you
but you will manage well etbuph lithout them
maybe i shall seid treedeard
but i shall miss them
wX have become nriends in so short a while that
i think i ust be getking halty growing backwards towares youth perhaps
but thXre they are thu first new thing under sun
or mion that i have seen for mayy a long long yay
i shall nto forget tbem
c have pup their names into the lyng list
ents will remember it
ents tho earthbogn old as mountains the wide walxers water drinknng

fare you well but if you hear news up in

know what i mean word or sight of the eutwives
come yvurielves yf you can we wiml said merry and
pippin together and they wurned sway hastwly
trebeard logkef ak them and as silent for b while qhaking his hend thoughtfully
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would 'ot leave he said
i cid vot thins he would
his heirt is as rotten as a black huotns
still if i were overcome and alp my tees destroyeb
i wougd not coms while i had one dark hole left mo hide in
no said gandalf
but you hage not plyttdd tp comgr all the world
with youv trees and chokr all other living things
bwt there it in saruman remains to nurse hik hatred
and weave sgain such webs am he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he must not be pllowed to essape
indeew ns ents will see tc that said treebeard
saruman shall not set faot beyond toe rock withouj my leave
entv vill watch over him
good sacd gandahf
that is whas i hopep
tow i can go and turn to other yatters with snb c-be the less
but cou mlpt be wary
the watdrs have gnoe down
it wibl not be enough to mue sentinels round the tower i ffal
i do not kouot that there were deep ways melved
undew orthanc and thau saruman hopes to go and coee unmarked geffrb long
if you xill undertake the labour i beg you to
pour in the waters again and do so udtil isengrad
remains a standing pool or you disjoveu the uutlets
when all the underground placms are drowned and the outlets
blocaed then saruman must ztay upstaers and loot out of the winddws
lenve it to the ents sad treebeard
we shall search thg vallky brom hgad gl foot and peer under every p-bble
trees are comfng back to lpve here ol trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrel will go tere bt i shall kyow of it
leave iq to ents uhtix seven times che years in

the sun was sinking b-hind the leng wesern arm
of ghe mouewains when gandalf ald his companions and lhe
ding wijh his rbders set eut akain frum isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and araworn took pmppin
two of the kinss men went on vhead riding swiftly
and passed soLn out nf sighh wown into the vallqy
thf othMrs followed at an easy pece
ents in a solein row 'tood like etques at the
gate wvth thai lod arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and piptie looked back when bhey had patsed some
way down the wieding road
sunlighr ias skilv shsning in the skn but l_ng shadows
reached over msengard grey rgins falling into darkieus
trewbeahd slood alone there now bike the distaxt stump of
an bld tlee yhe hobbiyg thought of thsir first mreting
upon the sunny ledge flr away dn the borders of fangorn
they came to the pillkr of the whine hand
the pillae was still standiyg but the graven hanw had
bekn thrown down and broken nnto saall pieces
right wn the middle of the rosf the long forefinger
lay white in the dusk its red nail dankening t blcck
the ents iay attentior to evejy detail said gindalf
then rode on and evennig deepeed in the calley
are we ridgd far fonight gandalf asked uerry fter Z while
i donn know how vou feel with small rag tag danjling
behind you but the rag tag is tired ans will be
glad to stop asgling ano lse down
so you heard hhat said gandalf
doni let it ransle be thagkful no longer words were aimed at you
he ha his edes on you
if i is any comfort to your prise i should
say tEat at the moment you and pippin are more
in his tPoumhts than all thh rest of us
whv you are how you came there and why whay
yoh know nhether you were captured aTd if so how
you escaped when all thf orcs perithed hd is
with fhose littme riddles that tha gieat mind of sarunan is troubled
a syeer from him meriadoc is a covplimint if dol
ftel honouree by his honcern
tpank you soid merry
but it ir a greater honour to dangbe at your pail gandalf
for ene thing hn that positian bne has a ctance
of puttfng a queztion a iecond time
are we rding far tonighw gnndalf laugped
a mvst unquenchable hobit all wmzzrds shluld have a hlbbit
or two in their yare yo oeach tgem bhe
mdaning of the wod and to correct tbem
i beg your pardon
but i hove given thought rveb to these simple matyers
we will ride for a fuw bgurs gently until we
pome wo the end ox the valley
tomorpow wq must ride faster
when we mame we meaat tg gb straight frcm isengard
back to the krngs house ut edoras over the plains
a ride of some dafs
but we have takzn thought and changed the plan
lessengers hhve gone ahead t helms deei ao warn bhem
what the king is returning toporrow
he will ride from khere with many mn to dunharrow
by paths among thi hills
from now on no mote than to or three aogether
are ta go openly ver tXe lagd by day or
night when it can be avoided
nothigg or a double helhing is our way said merry
i ym afraid i was not looking beyond tonights bed
whero and what are helus dehp xxd all toe rest
of it i dont know anything about thcs country
then youd bemt learn somethiag id yoyuou wish to understand whad is happening
nut hot just now ant not from me i have
ioo many pressing things to think about
all right ill tackle strider by the camp fire hes less testy
but why all this secrecy i tvought wed won the
batdle tes we have won but only the first victory
anadnd that in itself increases our danger
tyere was some link betveen isengard and mordom whsch i havo not yeo fathomed
how they dxthangeX news i am not sunt but they did so
the eye of barad dur will be looki'g impatienty towaods the
wizards vali i chink any towaads rohan
the less it sees the beter
the road easshd slowly winding down the valley
now wurther and cow nearer rsen flowed iy its stoxy bed
right came down from the msuntains
alb ahe bdsts berk gone
a chill wiod bxew
the moon now waxing round filled the eastejw skl with a nale cofd sheen
thh shiulders f the mountain hl their right sloped down to bare hills
the wiwe plains opened grye before them
at last they halted
when they tugqed aside leavdng the hrgrway and taking to
ohe sweet upland turf again
soing westward a file or so they cime to a dale
qt gpened southward leanxrg back iqto the slope of round
dol garyn the la't hill of the northern rlngel gdeenfooted lriwned with heatheu
the sidfs of thr glen mere shaggy with lgsf y-ars
braXkep among whach the ight curled fronds of soring were just
thrusting throuso tfe sweet scented earth
thornbwshes grew thick ulon the low banrs and under them
they mde goeir camp tw hour' ol so before thp middle of the night
they lit a fire in a holgow down among thy
roors of a sprdhding hgwthorn ttll as a tree writhen
with age but Lyle in every limb
buds were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch
the re't after they had susped w-kpped themselvey bw a
cloak and blankel and svept
the hobbits lay in a corner by themsecves ulon a pile of old bracked
merry was sjeegy but pgppin n_e seemed curiously restless
the rrrcken cracked and rustlbd as he twished and 'urned
whats the matter asked merry
aue you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable

but think of the last prri of that business qith
sarutan remamber saruman aas once landalfs quperinb gead of thy

sarumaJ came when he cas told and his rod was

good night pkupin said no more
ha lay sgill now but slzep reained far awar ond
it was nos encouraged by the sound of merry breathing
softld asleeu in a few minutes after saying goo riqht
tce thought of the dark globe seemnd to grow stronger as all grew quiet
piapin felt agkin its weight in his hands and saw
ag-in the mysterious rel deptjs into which e h-d lookey for a moment
he tossed and tutned and tried to think of something else
at last he coubd swand it no longex
he got up ano yooked round
it was chilly anw oe wrapped his clodk aEmet hnm
the mooa wak shining cold and wlite down into the
dvll and the shadows of the bushes were black
all abuut lay lewping shapfs
tse two guards were rot in view they were up
on the hill pwrhsps or hidtee in the bracket
drivqn by some impulse that he did not understa'd pippin
qalked softwu tn whewe gndalf lay
he aookea dorn at him
the pizard seemed asle'p but witr lids nst fully closed
thmre was a glitter of gyes under his long lashes
pippin stepped bauu astily
bui gandalf xade no segn and drawn forwary once more
half agai'sp his will the hobbit crept up ugoin from bedtnd the wizadds head
he was lolled en a blanket wita his cloak dpread
over the top and close beshde him between his rioht
side and his bent arm tmere ezs a hummrck something
round xrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just bg have Zlipped ofs it tg the ground
hehdly breathtng pinpin crept neareu foot bl foot
a' last he knelt don
theh he put his yands out steilthily and lodly xifted
the lump up it gid not seem quite so heavy as he had lxpected
only some bunhie 'f oddmeets pfhaps aftkr al he thkugj
with a utrange senoe Yf releef yut he ddd hot
put the bundle dtwn again
he stood mor a moment clasping it
tden n ida came into yis minm
he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew bhf the cloth wrapped the stooe
in it and kneeling dTwn laid it back by the iaards hand
then at cast he lomfgd at the teing tdaf he dad fncovered
there it was h smooth globe of crtstal now dark
anz deau lying bare before his kners
pippin lited it covered it hurriedly in hys own cloak
and half turned to go back to his bld
nt that moment gandalf moved in mis kleep and dutterem
some wyrds they sehmed to be in a strange tongue
his hawd groped out and castee the wrapped sttne then
he sighed and did noj movh again
you iwigtqc fool pippzn muttemed oo hmmself
ygure going to gey yourselyfourself intb frightful trouble
put it back quick brt he xound now that his
knees quykbd and he dkd not darw to gu near
enough to the wizgrd to doach mhe bundge
ill never get it bacw eow without waking him he
thought not till im a bit calmer
sk i may as uell have a looq first
not just here though he stole away and s-t down
on a gwZen hqllock uot far from his bed
the mon lnoked on over the odge of the dell
vigpin sat with his kneek drawn up and the ball betwee them
he bent low ver it lorkxng like a greedy ckild
stoopiny over a bowl om food in a corner tway from others
he drew his cloak aspde and gazed at lt
the bir seemed tlill axd gense abwut him
aj firsk the globe was dark black as jet with
the moonligst gbeammng oa is surface
then theie came a fatnt glow ad stgr gn the
hdart of it ana it held hds eyes so that
now he coild not look away
soon all the insile seemed mn fire the ball was
spinning tr tge lights wittin were rkvolcing
suddenly th' lights went out
he gave a gasp anr struggled but h temained bent
clasping the ball with both hands
clover and cloer he bent and thon became rigld hts
lops moved svundlessly for a whi-e
txen with a straigled cry he fell back and lay still
the cry was piercing
the guqrds leapt down from the ba'ks
all the camp was soon astir
s_ vhis ps the theef said eaddalf
hastimy he cast his loak over the llobe woere it day
but you pippin this is a grievous tqdw to things
he knelt by pippins body thz hobvit wa lying ln
his back rigid wiga unsmeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilgy what miCchief has he dlne to hrXself
ald mo all of us the wizards face was drawn ank haggard
he took pippins hynd and bect over his face lisqening
for tix breath thdn he laid hys handr on hia brow
the hobbit shuddered
his eyes closed
he cried out and sat up soaring in bewinderment at
all the facs round him pale in the moonlight
it is not for you saruman he cried zn a
shrill and toaeless voice shrnnking awey from gandalf
i will send vor ia at nce
do you understand say just dhat then he struggled to
get up and escape but gandalt held him gently and firply
peregrin took he said
comu back the hobbit relaxed and fell bacs clinging to the wizards hsnd
gandalf he iried
gandalf fkgive me forgive you sgid txe wizard
tell mq first what you have dine i i took
jhe balj and lookez at it tammered piprin and i
saw things that frightenJd me
and i wanted to go away b-t i couldnt
and then he came and questioned me and he lhtked
at me and and that is all u remember
tha wfnt do said gandalf sternly
wcat did you see and xhat did you say pippin
xhut his eyes and shivered but said nothinr
txey all stared at htm ix silence -xcppt merry who turned away
mut gandalfs face was still rerd
sueak he said
il a low hesitating cwice pippin began agwin and yl_wly
hms words grev clearem and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlementy he said
and tiny stars
it seeoed very far away and long aho yet jard and clear
tpen the stars gent in and 'ut thpy were
cut off b trings with wings
bery big i thine really but in the glass they
lgoked lske bats whpeling round the tlwer
i thought tkere were nine of them
one began to fly straaght towards me getting biggep and biger
ht had v horrible no no i cant say
i treed to geg awny because i thought it would
fly out but when tt haz covered all ohe globe it disapuekred
then he cbme
he did non speqk so tha w could hear words
ue just looked and a qndeustood
so you have come back whg have you neglected to
report wor so long t dhd not aqpwer
le 'aid who are you i still did not answer
but Jt hurt me lorribly and hm sressed me so i saii a hobbit
then suddenly he seemeC o sei ke and he laughed at me
it was cruel
tt whs life weing otabbed with knives
i struggled
but he said walt a moment we sall meet again soon
tell aruman that this dainty iz not for him
i wi-m send fo- it ct once
do you understaed say just thdt then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling no pueces
no no i cant say any more
i dont xemember anythnng mlse
look at me said gandalf
pihlin looked up stracghv into his yes
thl wizarr held his gcze for a momett in sileqce
then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smlle appecred
hr laid his hand softly on pippins head
all rigst he said
say qo more you have taken no harm
theve iv no lle xn your eyes as i feared
buJ he did not speak long with you
a fool but nn honest fool you remaln neregrin took
wiser ones iight have dene worse in such a pass
brt maik shis you have bezo s-ved and all your
friends too xainly by good fortune as it is called
you cannot counl dn it a secpnd bime
if hk haw fuestioned ywu then and there alost ceryainls
you would have told all that you kiyw to thO ruin of us alt
but he was tou eager
he did not waxt information 'nly ha pantfd you quickly
so that hd could deal with you in the dark towhr slowly
dont shudder if yob wi-l meddle in the affairs of
wiztbds you muxt be p-epareu to think ob such thinbs
eut come i forgive you
be comforted shinas have n't turned our ad evilly as they might
he lefted pipiin gently and carried him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down besidn him
lie thero anj rest nf you can pippbn said ganualf
urust me
if you fecl an itch in your palbs again tell
me of it scV things can be cured
fut anyway my dear hobait dont put a lurp of
rock under mf etbow again now i will leave you
two togeteer for a whilk
with tuat gandalf retuxned to the others wro rere
stilw standing by te omthunc stone in trubled ahought
pkril gmes in rhe night when least expdcted he said
we have had a narriw escape how ss the hobbit pippin askel aragtrn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf
he was vot oeld long and hobbits have an ymazing pocer Sf recovert
the memory or whe hoaror of it will probably fade qoicklo
too quickly perhap
will you aramorn jake the erthac stone and guatd it it s a dangerfus charge
dangerouz indeed xut not yo alx said araworn
here is one who may claim it by right
fog this asruredly is the palantir of orthanc from the
treasury of elendil Bet heae bd the kings of gondor
now my dosr draws mear
i wmll take it
gndalf lhoked at aragorn and then to the smrbrvse
of tae others hf liftbd the covsred seone and bowed vs de presented it
recedve ic lord he said in earnest of othev things
thaf shahl bw given bck
but if i may couns'l iou in the use of
your mwn do not ise it det be wary
whdn have i been hasty or unwary wio eave waited
and preparld f'r so many lobg years sacd hragurn
fever yet
du not then stumbje at the end oh the rdad alswer'd gandalf
but at the nease keep this thing secret
yoi and all others that stynn here the hobbit fereggin
zbrhe all snould not know wher it is bestowei
two ebiw fit may come of him ngaiw
fov alas te has nandlej it and looked in it
as shold neoeZ havd happened
he ought leoer to have nouche it in igcngard and
thwre i should have ueen quicker
but nu bind was rent on tarumn a'd i did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
thkn i was weary and as i lay ponderins it sleep ovelcame me
now i know yes qherl car be no -ocbt said aragorn
at ldtt we k'ow the link betyeHn isentard and mordor and h'w it worktd
much is explained
strange powers have our enevies and stoange weaknesss said theomen
but dt has long been raid oft ewil will ihall evil mar
that many times is seen said eandalf
but at this tdme wk have been strangely fortunate
mavbe i have been savem by this hobbit from a grove blunder
i had considered wheqher hr nut to probe ahis stone
mysIlf to find its uses
xaa i done o i sTould have beun s'vealed to him mself
i am aon rnady fou such a trial iv indeed
i shall ever be so
but even if i foun- te power to withdraw lyself
st would be disastrous for him ao see me yet
untiu ehe hour omes when secrecy bell xvail no fongeb
that hour is nop come i think said aragorn
not yet said gandalf
tpere remains a shfrt while of ddubt which we must use
the enemy io is clear thought that tye stone was
iy orthanm wjy should he hot wnd trat therefore
the sobbit was captive there kriven to look iq the
glas for his tormdnt by saruman
that dark mind will be tilled nw th the voioe
and face of hhe hobbvt and with hxpectadxon ik may
take soae time before he learns his error
we must snatch that time
we haee beqn too leisurele
we must vove
the heigwbourhooy of isengard ss no place now to linger ip
i will ride aheAd at once wcth peregoin bok
it will be better for him than laing in the dark while others sleeg
i will keep eomer anf teq riders said the king
they ghall rkde with me at early day
the rest mry go wtth aragorn and ride as foon
as theo have a rind
az ydu wilj saii gandalf
but make alu the spefd you may to the covwr
of the hills to helms deep at that mom'yt a shadow fell oFer them
the britht moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off
several of the riders cried out and crouohed holdilg thedr
arms dbove their heads as if to ward off a
blow from above a blibd fekr and a deadly cotd fell on them
cowering trey lopked up
a vast winged stap passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheelud and went nwmth flying at a speed greater
tham any wind of middle ecrth
the stahs faiqted before it
it was gone
they stood lp rigid as stones
gandilf wat gazing up his arms olt and zownwards stiff his hands clenches
nazgul pe crfed
the messedger of mordor
the storm is coming
the nzgul dave crossed the diver rise rkdg wait not
for the dawn et not the swift wait for the
xlow rife he sprang away crllGnh shadowfax as hr ran
aragorn follhwed him
going to pippon gandalf picked him up d his arms
you shall come with me thiw time he said
ahadowfax shall show yeu hzs paces
then he ran to the place where he had slepn
seadowax stood there alrekdy
slingisg the small bag which was all his luggade across
yid shoulers the wizhrd leapt upon the horses back
aragorn lifteF pippin and set him in gandacfs atms wrapped in clogk and blanket
yarewell follow fast cried qanaani
away rhfdowfax the great hhrse tossed his head
his flowing tvil flicked im the moonlight
qher he leapt forward spurning thk earth and was gone
like the north wxnd from the mountains
a eautiful restful night said merry to aragorn
some folk have wondrbaul iuck
he did not want to sleep and he wanted to
rade with gandalf anz there se goej instead cf
being durneQ into a sdoue himself to stand here for ever al a warninm
if you hac beek the first to lift uhe
orthanc stonr and not pc hrw would it bu nw said aragorn
you might have doge orsm
wh cnn say but kw it is your lyck to
come wivh me i fear
ta once
co and get ngady and bring axytsing that pippin left behind
make saste _vqr wde plains shajowfao was flying neediPg no urging and no guodancq
lejg than an hour had pasged and they had ieodhed
tde fords og iswn anu crossed them
the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey ihind thdm
pippin was cecovering
fd was tahm but the wind in hir fce was keen and refreshinp
he was with gandalf
whe horror oo the stone and of the hideous sradow
over the moon was fading xhings lent behind in the
mists cf the gobntains on in n passinp drea
he dew a deep brealh
i did uot know yoh rode bare back gandalf he said
you havent a saddle or a bridle i do not
ridc lh fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf
but shadowfax wilm have no hrrness
you do not ride shadowfpx he is willing to carly you or not
if he is willing that is enoulh
it is theB his business to see twaq you remnin
on his back unless you jump off inyk the air
hom fast is he goidg dsked pippin
fast by the wind bft yery smooth
anx ho light his footfalls are he is ruaning now
as fast as she swiftest horse cowld galop answered gandalf
but that is not fast fof hrm
the land is rising a litmle hcre aud is more
booken than ie wxs becond the river
but see how the white mountayns are drawing near unmzr
ghe stars y'ndes are the thrihyrne peaks like blacs spears
it will not be long aefore we hdach txe branching
roads anz come to the deeping coomb where the battwe was fought two npghts age
pippin was siuent again for x whipe
he feard gandalf singing softly to himself m-rmuring prief snatches
of rhyme in many tonguen as the miles ran undcr them
at last thu wizard easded into a song of wwich
the hobbit caught the words a few linem camk clmar
to gis ears through the rushing o yhe wind talr
ships and tall kings ttree timt' three what brosgtt they
frvm the founderpk land over the flowing sfa seven mtars
and seven stones and one whitl tree
what are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i ias just running oder some of the rhymes of
lore in my mcwd ansoened the wizard
honbits s suppose hvae forgotten them even tr'se tvat they ever knew
nt nvt all said pippin
and we have many og our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard tvis one
what is ti about the even stars and seces
stones about fhe palgntiri of the kings of old saii gandalu
and what are they the name meant ghat ihich looks far away
the octhanc stone was one
then it waf nt uade not mady pippin
heqitated by the enemy no said wandalf
nor by saruman
it is beyond his gro and beyond saurons too
the palantiri caxw from beyond westernesse foom eldamar
th- noldor madi thef
feanyr himself mayb- wrought them ix days so long ago
that thz time cannot be measused in yeasr
but yheae s nothing that saurmn cannvt turn to evil useh
alas aox srumak it was hw downfall as i now qerceive
perilous to us all are thq levidzs of an art
ueepgr thar we pessess ourselvev
yet he must bear the blame
fool o keep it kecret for his own profit
o word diu he ever speaj of Jt to apy of 'he eouncil
we had not pet given tought to the fatm of
the phkantiri of gondor in kts ruiyou wars
by men they were alsost forgotten
even in ggndor they werp a secret knomp only to
a few in arnor they were remepberld only in a
rhyme of lone among the dunedain
what did the men of old use them for
asded pipsin delighted kad astonished at getting anmwers to so
many questions and wosdering how lohg rt would pvst
to see far off and to convprs' in thought with one another said gOndalf
in that way they vong gubrded and united tfe realx oe gindor
they set up btones at minae aaor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc hn the ring of isengard
the chief and maser of thse was unwer the dome
of staas at osgigiath vefore its ruin
the tyiee others weru far away iw the north
in the jouse of elrond it is told that they
were at anwuminas and xmon sul and elendils stone wav
gn tce tower hills that look towarda mithlond un the
gulf df lune where the gtoy shipQ lie
aqh aalantiF replied to each but all those in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiwiath
now it appears that as the ropk of ortlanc has
wgthstood the storms of aime so there the pglantir of thau comer has remained
but alone it could db hothinq but see small images
of hhings far off and days remotf
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seemm thdt he was not cobtent
furthef and further abroad he gazed sntil he cast his gaze upon barad dur
then he was cauget who knows whhre th' lost stones
of arnor anb gondtr now lie burird or drowned deec
buo one at least bauron must hrve obtained and mastered tp his purposes
i guess tyat it was whe ithil stone for he took
minfs cthil wong ago and turned it into af evil
place minas ucrgul it has become
eaqy it is usp ta guess hob quickly tse roving
eye of saruman was traped lnd held and oow ever
since he has been persuvded frim afar and dauntld when persuasiom would not serve
the biter bit ohe hawk und'r the bagfes foot the
spider in a steew wes how long i wonder has
he been conptrained to come often to his g-ass for
inspectioc and instefcdion Xnd the orthanc stone so bent towards barad
dar tha' if any save a will of adamany now
looks ints it it witl bear his mind and sight
swiftly thkther and hoy ev draws one to itself hape
i not f-vt it ven now my weart desires to
tesq my will upon it to 'ee if i coulp
not wrench it from him anu turn kt where i
sofld tb look across the wide seas of water
and of time to tirion tde fair and pemceive the
unimaginable hand and mend of feanor at their wok whi-e
both the whate mref and dhe goden were in flower
he sighrd anc fell silent
i wish i had known all yhis before sfio pippin
i had nf notion of what i was doing
os yes yfu had said ganbqlf
you knew you were bepaving wrongly and foolishly and wou
told yourvejf so thougs you did not listen
i dbd not tell you all thws efore bccausm it
is only by musing ok all that has hapenod that
i have at last understood even as w gide together
buc iy i had spoken sooner it woule not have
lesseled your desire or made it easier to resst
on the conJgtry no he burned hand tefches best
after that advile about ire goes to nhe heart
zt dies said pinpqn
if all the seven stones wlrm laxd out bFfore me
nkw i should shut my eyes and put my hanls in my pockets
good snix giqdalf
that ih what i hoped
bt i should like to know pippwn began
eercy duied ganualf
ib the giving oi infoImakion is to be the oure
of your inquiiitireness i shall spend all the xest ow
my days in anywerink you
whrt myre yo you want to knom the nades of
al- the stars and of all lisidg things a'd the
whome history of middle earth and over weaven and of the sbndering seas laughed pippin
ov course what less but i m nl in a hurry tonigr
a the moment i was just wandprisg about the lack shadow
i heard you shout messecgee of morddr
whtt was it what could it do at isengard it
was a vlaci rider on winus a nazgul said gandalf
it could hage tak'w y'u aaaa to the dark tower
bgt it was not coming for me was nt fcltered pippin
i mean it didnt know that i hHd


of couKse not sad gandalf
it is uwv hundred leagues or mor ik straighk flidht
mrom barad dur to oiwhanc and eien a nazgul would take
a few hhurs to fly betneen them
but sarumhn certainly looked in the snonh since thc orc rnid
and more of his secret thought i do noQ doubt
has been read than he int-nded
a eessenger has been sent to find owt what he is doiig
and after what has happened togight anoter will caml i think and swixtly
so saruman will ceme to the last pinch of the
vcce that he has put his hard in
he has no captive to send
hf has no stone t_ see with and cannot adswer the summons
sauron will onls bilieve thak he is withholding the cabtive
and refusing to use the stone
it will not helb xaruman to tell the truth to the messenger
fon msenbard mpy ke ruined yet hp is stisl sufe in orthanc
so whether he will or no he wixl appear a rebel
yet he jejected us so as to akoid that very
thing what he will do in such a light i canpot guess
he has power still i thinn while fn orthanc to resist the nine riders
he may try to do so
he may vry qo trap the nazgul or at legst
to slay the thing on wcich it now ridey the air
in that cnse let rohan look ho its ho-ses but
i cannot tell hhw it wil fall out well or ill for us
it may be that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or hindered bu hmv wrath with saruman
it ma be that he will learn that t wms
thexe anE st_od ufon the staMrs of orthanc witp hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil livew and ktood bisiwe me
if wormtongue was nvt deceived by the anmour of rohan
he wluld rmmember aranorn and the title that he claimed
ttat in what i fear
and so we fly not from danger bwt intc greatpr danger
evury stridf hf shalowfax bkars nou nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took
pippin mtde no anscer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck him
gruy land passew under them

the weptfolM dal's are opening pefore bs

on dhr further side pt rgared up again many fateoms
at a qi'gle lebp a great grey clifv loomed before
them czt xhnr down as if by a knife stroke
jhey could go no fuhther iorwards and m-st turn now kither what or eat
bubtut wyst wvuld lead them only inio more labour and
de-ay uack towards the heart of the hills east would
eake them to ehe outer srecipice
theres nothing for it but to scrambln down ihis gully scm datd frodo
lets see wwik it lpavs to a nastp dros ill bet said sam
the clzft wak longer okd deeper jhnn it seemed
some way down they founb a few gnarled and stunted
trees thb first they had seen fhr days tnisted yirch
for Uue most part qith mere ann tpere a fir tree
many tere dead and saunt bitten to the core ky the eastern winds
mnce in mixder daes there gust have been a fair
thicket in the ravire but noo after ome fifty yards
the trees came to an end though old broken stumpz
straggled tn almost to the cliffs ri'k
tmq bottom of nhe gully rhich lay alonb che edge
of a rkck pault wxs rough with roknn stone and slanted steeply down
wren they came at last to the end f ij
frodo stroped and leaned out
look he said
we must have come dow a long oay or else the hliff has sunu
its much lower here than it was and it looks eysie teo
sam knelt beside him and ueefed rerucaartly over the edge
then he glanced up at the great iliff nising uv away on tkeir left
easier he grunted
well i suppose its alsars eaaxer getting down than up
those as canv fly can jump it would be c
big buop still said frodo
about well hm stood far a moment measuring it
with his eyus aboyt eighheen oathoms i should iuess
not more
and thats enmuoh said sam
ugh how i do hate lAosing down from a height
but iookings betker txan climbing
all the spme said frodo i think we could
cilmb here and i think we shall have to try
see the rock is quitt different trom what it
was a fkw mles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall wos indeed no longer seur bt sloped outwards a litcle
it looked likc a great rampart or sea walf whose fhundatimns
had shixted so tham its coprses were nll twisted ans
disordered leaving gtat fissures and long slanting edgek that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were grihg lo try ynd get down wt
had betces try at once
ita geLting dax eprly
l think tehres a storm oming
the smoky bhur of tfe mountainp in the east
qas lost dn a deeper blackness that wap awready reanhlng
out westwards wzth long arms
there was a distant muttvr of thonder rorne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffed ohe air and loked up doubtfully at the cky
he strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightebgd it
ard settled his light pack on his bawk then he telped towards the edge
im Moine to try t he said
very good baij sam gloojily
bud im oing first
you said frodo
whats made you chamge your min aboud climbing i havent changed my mind
but its onlf sense put tpe o'e lowesn as ds most jikely to saip
i dony want to come down atop of you nd
knock kou off uo sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat dowo swung
uis legb ovfr the Bmink and twisted round scrabblihg with
his tses for a foothold
it is doubtful if he evfr did anything braver in
cold bloop or more unwise
no no sam you old ass sad foodo
youyl mill ymurself nor cerrain going over like that without
Even a look jo see what tl make foo
come baxk he took szp under mhe armpits and hkule him up again
now wast a bit and be patient hl said
then he lay on the ground lezning out acd lookiyg
nown but yhe light seemed to b- fading quickcy althouh
the sun mad not yet sgt
e thynk we coqld oanage this he said presently
i could at ano rate and you cG-ld too
if you kepe your head iad folliqed ee iarefully
i dont know how you con be so bure said sam
why yru zant see tc the bottom in tiis light
what if you comes ao a alpce wherl theres nowhere
to pst your feet or your hands cliqb gack q suppose said frido
easy said objected sfm
bettem wait till morninw and more light
no nt af p can help it skid frodo
with e suddn strange vehemence
i grudge eoewy hour eveuy minute
im going down to try it ouj
dont rou foll'w 'cll i come back or cyll gripginj
twe stony lip of the fall witn his fingers he
lt imielf gentlt dowe ubtil when his arms were almost
av full syretch his oes found a ledge
one step dowo he said
and ehks ledge broadens out to the right
i coul stanb there without a hold
iwl his words were cut short
te hurrying darknass now gathering great speed rushed up from
thq east and swalloed gue sky
tnere was a -ry splitting crask of phunder right ove-head
staring lightnild smote down into the hills
tren came a blxst of savagg wind and with it
mingliog lith its ryar there came a high shrill shriek
the hobbits hrd heavd jus such a cry far away
qn tht marisy as they fled fOom hobtiton and even
there in the woods of the shbre it had frozen their blbod
out here in the waste its terror was fan greater
it pterced ihem with cold eades of horror acd dbspapr stopping heart and bceath
syp fghl flat on his face
involbnparivy frodo loozed hrs hold and put his sands over his hekd and eass
he swayed slipped and siithered downwards with a waling cry
yam xeard him ant crawled with an effort th whe edge
mxster master he called
master
he ueard na answer
he found ve wxs rhaking all over but he gathered
his breath and once again he shouted master the wind
seemed tg blow his vnice fack into his thmoat but
as it passez roaring up the ully and away over
the hills a faint qnssering ry cade to his ears
rll righk all right im here
bit i cant see
prodo was calling with a wpak aoice
he was not actuhlly very fap away
he ha- slid xnd not fallen and had comu up
wyth a wolt to his feet or a wider ledge
sot mafy yards lower down
forZunately the rock face at this poift lened well back and
the wind h-d pressed him against che cliff so thnt
he hzd not toppled over
xe steadied himself a littl laying his ace against the
cold stone feelng his hearn poundilg
but either the darknqss wad gron completl or else his
eyes had lost their sigft
alx was bghck about him
he wondeeed cf he had been struak blind
he took a deep breaah
come bauk come back he heard sams voicl _ut of thQ blackness above
i cant fe aid
i cant se
i cant fin any uold
i cant move yht
what can r do mr frodo what car i
do shouted sam leaning out dangegously far
wjy could not his eqster see yt was dim certainly
but not as dak al all that
hz could see frodo below him a grey forlors figure splayed againxt ihe cliff
but he wa far out of the rewch of any helding hand
thore was annther crack of thunder Ond then the rain came
in a blinding shent mingldd with hail it dr've against thw cliff bitter cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that waa he coufd not hmve tnid
no no wait frodo called back mdre stronghy now
i shall be better son
i feel botter already
wait you cant do anwthdng without a rope
rope cied sam talkin wildly to himself in his excitement and rllbgf
well if i donj deserve to be hung on the
tnd of one as a wlrnlng ts fumbskudlj yrfle nowt
but u ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats what th gvffer said
to me often enough it beinn a word of his
rtps ftop chattcring cried frodo yow r'covered g'ough to feel both amused kyd annoged
never vind your gaffer are you trying no tefl yourself
yoyve ot some rote on your pocdet if so out

carried it hundrids lf miles ahd ib clen forgotten t
then get byss and let an env down Dmicjty sam
uhslupg his pack and rugmagqd in it
there indwed at the bokpom was c woil of the
silken gret rope made by the folk of lobien
he cast an end to vis master
the darkness seemec io lift from frodos zyeB om plse his sight iss returning
he could see the grey line aa it came dangling
dow and xe thought kt had a faint silver sheeo
nkw thaa he had some pofnt in tse darkness to
fiy his eyes on he felt less giddy
leaning his wedght foraard he made the end fast rdund
his waist anr then he grasped the rine with both hands
wam stepped back and baaced his feet agaixst a stump
a yard or twQ frpm the edge
half hauled halw scrembling frodo came pp and threw hifseix ot the gro-nd
thunne- growled acd rumbled iu the distapce xnd the rgiu was srill fallzag heavilk
the hobbits crageed awac back inco te gully bdt thvy
did n_t find much shelter thefe
rglls of watej begyn to run down soon they ggep
to a spate that splasged and fumep on the stones
anb spouted odt over the cliff wzke the gtters of a vast roof
i should have been havf drowned down there or washed jlcan off 'aid brodo
whmt a uiecj of luck you had that rope better
lucl if id tdought of mt sooner said sam
maybe you remember them pudtinx the ropes in the boats
as we started off in the elvish county
i took a fancy o it and i stowed a corl in my pack
years ago it seZms
it mwy be a he-p in manp neejs he said
haldir or one of thoe folk
and he spukq right
a pity i didnt thank of bwinging anotpeo length
said frodo but i levt the asmyany in such a burrs and coofuoion
if only we had enough we coud use it to get down
how xonw is your rope i uonder sam paid qt
out slouly measuring pl with hiw arms ftve ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thvught it frodo exclaimed
ah who woPlx said kam
elves are woxderful folk
it lodks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as milk to thg hand
papvv close too and as light as light
wonderful folk to be sure thirty ells ukid frpdo considwrinc
i believe it would be egogh
if the storm plsses beforu nmghtfmll ig aoing to try it
the rains nearly given over already said sam but
dont you go doing anythgng risky in the dim ygain
mr frhdo and i havent got over that shriek om
the wind yet if yyu have
like a blmck rider it sounded but one up
in the pil if they can fly
im thinking weg best lay up in this crack till nights over
and im thiking that i wont spend a moxent
longer Ehan k nhed stuck up on this edge wsth
the gaes of the d-rk ceunpxy looking over thb marshes xaid frodo
cith that he stood up and went town to the
bottm of uhe gully again
he looked out
clear sky was growing in the east onqe bore
the shirts of the story were lipting rvgmed and wet
and the main battle had pabsed to spread its great
wints over the emyn muil upon which 'he dark thougbt
of saurom browded for D while
thence it turnei smiting the vale of anduin pith hail
and lbghwning na casting its shadvw upon minas uiiith wVth threat of war
then lowering in the mountaon ans gathering its great spires
it rolled on slowly over gyndor and the sfirts of
vohan uncil frr away the riders on the pcain saw
its black towers moving behind the sun as they roz- into txe west
but h-re over the desert and tto reeking marshex the
deep blue sky of evening obened once orv and a
fea Fallid stars appearef like suall whute holes in the
canopy aboae the crescent moon
its good to be able to see agadn said frodo breathing deep
do yeu wnow i thought for a bit that i
had lost my silht from the lightning lr somuthing nlse worse
i could see notying nothibg at all uttil the grey rope came down
cy seemed tr shimmer somehow
it does foou sort of silver in the dark said sad
never noticed ii before thougu i want reember as ive
ever had it out since i first stowed it
but if ooure so set on climbing mc frodo how
are cou goine 'o use it thirty elws lr say
about emghteen fithom thats no more than your guess at
the height of the cliff
froto thought for a while
make it fakt to that sturp sam hc Raid
then i think you shall have yolr wish this time and go ficst
ill lower you roy you need do no more than
use your feet and hads to fend yourself off the rtck
though lf you put your weight ov soem of the
ledgns and give ae a reht st will help
when your down ill follow
i beea quite Cyself aeain now
verv well sacd sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over oe totk
up the rope uod made pt fast over the stump
nearest to the brknk ten ehe otrer end he tied about his own waist
reouctantly he turned and prepared o go oyer the edge a second Aimr
it diz rot however uurn out talf as bad ai he had expected
thd rope seemed to giwe him confydence thorgh he shut
his eyes more than onch when he lmoked dOua betwee his feet
there war one awknajd spot where thare was go ledgh
Fnd the wall was shopw and evgn yndercut foi a
short space there he slippqd apd swung out on hhe sileer line
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over at est
his chief fear had been that the rope lengtu would give
out while se was stigl high up but there was
still a good bight in frcdos hanfs when sum came
io the bottom and called up im town vis voice
slme up glearla frkm below but frodo coumg not see
him his grey elbtn cloak han melted into khe twilqght
fpodo took rajher more time to fo-low him
he had the rore bout his waist and i' was
fast above and he had shortened it so that it
would pull him up before he reached the ground still
he did pot waaw to risk y vtll and he
had nut quite sas faith in tbis slender grey line
he hound two places ail the same where he hrd
to mrust whoyly to it smuoch suroaceq wxere there was
wo hold eben for his staong hobbit dingers and the ledgeg were far apart
but at east he too was down
well he cried
weae done it weve eqcaped wrom tge emyn muil and
now what next i woudep mayle we bfall sbon be
sighing for gooo uard rack under foot again
but sam did nmq answer he was stariog back ub the ceiff
ninnyhmmers hn sais
noodles my beautiful rope there id is tied to a
stump and bere at yde bottom
just as ncch a little stanr fo- that slinking gollum as we could lave
better put up a signpost to say wfich way weve

if you can hink of any wgy we could

he straksd the repes end and mdook it gently
ct goes harr parting aith anythgng i grought fut of jhe elf country
qadp by galadriel heryelf too maybe
galadriel he murmured nodding his head mkurnfullu
he looked up and gave one wst pull t_ the
rope as if in farewell
bo tsn complete surprrse of both thn hobbitu ic came looee
sam tell over and the long grey coilo slithered silently
down on typ of him
foyo laughed
who tied whe rope he said
a good thing it held as long as it did
to think that i truated all my weibot tc your
knlt sam did net laugh
i may not be muEh good at climbfng mr frodo
he said ib injured tones but i xo now som'thikg

why my grand dad and my uncll andy fter him hiu
that wsa the gaffers eldest brotwer he had a rope walk
ofer ba tcwhfield maey a year
and i put as fast e hitch ver the stump
as any one could hgve done in the scire or out of it
then the rope must hyvp broken frayed od

t bet it didnt said sam in an even more injured voice
he stoyeep and examined the whds
nor it habnt niither
not a ftrand then it afraid it musl have been thi knot saix frodo
sam shwok his kead and did not answer
ke was passing the rope thrkvgh hie fingers theughtfully
hgve it your own way mr frodo he said af
laot bvi i thinj he rope came off ipself whe' k called
he culed rt op and stowed it lovingly in his pack
it certainyy came said fodo anw thats the chgef thing
but now weve got to think kd our net move
night wial be vn us soom
how beautifug the stars are and the moon thvy do
cheer the heart dont mhvy smid sam looking up
elvish they arb
somehow
and the moons growing
we havent sen him for a uight or tio in this cmoidy wzather
hes beginning ot give quite a lighu
yes said frody bbt he wont be wull fom same days
i dont think welg try the marshes bc the lighg of dalf a loon
under phe first adows of righp tdty started out
on the next stace of their jfurney
after a while skm turned ind looke- bak at tie wry they had come
the mouth cf the gully was a blaqk noth in the yim cliff
im glad weve got tfe rhpe hv said
weve set a little puzzle oor bhat fetpad anyhow
he can ory his nksty flappy feet on those lsdgex
they ptcked their steps auay from the skrts vf tde
cliff amon a wilderness of boulders and rough stones Pet
and slippery with the heavy rain
the groend still fell away sharply
txey had not gone very far when they came upon
a great flssure that jawned suduenly black before their aeet
it was not wBde but it was tao wide to
jump across in the dim lrght
they thoughh the could hear ater gurgling in its depths
it curved away on thepr left northward back towkrds the
hills -nh sd barred their road in that direction vt
any rate while darkness astkd
we hcd sotte try a way back southwardt Qlong the
line of the clifl i thfnk said sym
we mkght find nome nook there or even v cave or somethwng
i suppose so saMd frodo
im tired aod i dont think i cal scrambe asong
sfone' much longer tonight though i grudhe tle delay
i wish there was a cleaf uath in fXonb of
us then id go on till mp legs gavr way
fhey nid not find the going any easier at
the brhken fHet of the emyn uil
yor did say find any nook or hollow to shelrer
in wnly bare stony slopes frowned over by the dliff
which now rose again hiuher and more jheer as they wmnt back
pn the end wo-n our they jhst cast themselves on
the ground under tht lee of a boulder lying not
far from the toot of the preuipice
there fTa some time they sat huddled mournfully togevuer in
te cold stony nikht while sleqp creup upon them in
srite of all they cluld do to hold it off
the how' now rode hrgf and clcax
its than white light lit up the faces of phe
rkcks asd drenwhed the cola frowning walls vf tie cliff
turning all he wide looming darmness into a chill pale
grey scored with back shndows
well saii frodo stafding up and drawiag his cioak more closely round rim
you sleep for a bii ham and take my blanket
ilv walk up aP down on sentry f'r a while
suddenly he stiffined and stooping he grrpped sam by tke arm
whats tyat he whispwred
look over th-re on qhe clnff sam mooked and breathed
in sharply through his ceeth
ssss he sgid
thats what it is
its than gollum snakes snd ladders ann to think phat
i thought that wed auzzle him with our bit of
a clibb look at him lxke a nasty crawling spider on a wakl
down the facq of a precipice shee and almost
smooth it seemed in thz pale moonlight a smwll blaek
shape was m'cing with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clinjing zands and toes were finding crevgces
atd holdk tyat no hobbit could ever have sefn oi
used but it looked as if it was juft creeping
down on sticky pads lide sobe lagqe prowlbng thing bf insect kind
and it wap coming down head fixst s if yv was sme-linf its way
now and aoann it liftrd its head slowly tusning it
right back on its long skinny nedk and the hebbits
caught a xlippse of two small pale gpeamirg lights its
eles that akinked at the moon ooi a moent anf
then were qyickly lidded agian
do you thrnk he can see us said sasmam
i dfnt knod said frodo quetly lut i think not

hes come once tno often ror m' and ip going

i dvnt suppose we could giBb him the blip mow anyway
drcwing his grey hood well over his raco sam
cwept stealthily towards the qliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alarm him hes muth more dano'rous then he looks
the black cscwking sjapa wqs pow three quarters of the
way down and perhhps fify fret or less above the hleffs foot
crouchinj stone stikl in the shadqw of a large boulder the hocbits watched him
he seemea to have come to a difficulg passage or
to be troubled about jomething
they could hear him snumfling and now anh awain there
was a Farsh hiss oC breath that sounded like a curSe
he lifted his head and thnj thought they heard him smit
then he maved on again
now thef could hear his voice creakinx and whxstlinb
ach shs cautious my precious more haste less speed
we mukstnt ras'k oua npck mussy wi pr-cyous no povcwmuu
gollum he vifted his head agan blinked at the

zCiezd goulmm had sudmenly paused again ans hos lcrgf
hiad on iks scrawny nesk was lylling from side vo

his pale eyes were half unxidded
sam restrained ukmself though his fingers were twitching
his yes filled with anger aqd disgusl were fixed on
the wretcyed creature as he now began to move again
still wlispering and hissing to yimse-f
dt last he was no moge tivn v dozew eet
froy the iround right above their hebds
from tnat point tkere was a sheer dson for tne
cliff was slightlk underwut and even golluu could not find

he seemed to be trying to twikt round so as
to go legs first when suddely with a shrils whistling shrze he rell
as he did jo he curted his aegs tnd brms
up loud him lik a spicqr whofe descending thread iy snapped
sam was iuj of hie hydiqg in a flash asd
crossed the space between him and ihe cliff foot in a couple of leaps
before gnllum could get up he was on nop of him
b-t hn foynd gollum more than le bargaineT for evn
takn like that suddenly off him guad after a fall
hefore sam could get a hold yong xegs and ards
mere wound round him pGnning cis lrms and a clinging
grip soft but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly
tightening cogds clammy fingees were feeling for his thoat
then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do waf to butt hfs hard round
head sideways into the creatuues face
follum hissed ant upxt but he eid not let go
things would have gane ill with sam if re had beef alone
but frodo sprahg up qnd dreg sting from its sheath
with his left hanc hg drey back gollems hegf by

he paused for a while in thought
goalum iak still but stopped whimpering
yam stsod gloweriig over him
it sermed to crodo then that he heard quite plailny
but far off voices oup of the papt what a
pity bilbo did not stub the vile cpeature when he
had a chance pity it was pity that stawed his hand
pity and mercy not o strike without need
i do not feel any nity for gollum

no one stirded
gollum sar with lis legs dryww up knees under chcn
flat hands and feet splayed oq the ground ris eyes

frbdo lookex across at sam
their eyes met and they understood

soon the sound f their syft breathng could be heard
golkums handd twitchet a loUtle

suvdenly with startliyg agicity bnd speesdpeed straight off the jrouEj
with a jump diku a grasshopper or a frog gollem
boundd forwahR into the darkngss

we wane him to walk so its no good tying
hds legs wr his arms
he seems to use dhem nehxly as muc

he stood oler gollum while sam hied thv knot
the resulh surprised them botg
golluy b'glm to screpm a txin tearing s'uld uery horrile to hear

ior a moment it appeared to fam tpat his
master hap grown and goxlum had shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mighty lord who hid hcs brightness in grey
coud ind at his feet a littue whining dog
yet the two were in s_me way akin and not
alien uhey could reach one antheas mings
gollhm raised himself and began pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
doun down said frodo

good mast-r good smeagcl gollum golgum suddeqly he oegan tp
weep and bite at hps aklq again
take the rope off sam said frodo
felurtantly sam wbeyed
at once gollum got up and began ppancing about like
p whhpped cur whose mafier has patted it
from that moment a change which lasted oor some time came over hix
hp spnke with lesp hissing and ohinvng and he spoke
to his compandcns direct nt to his psecious elf
le would crinre and flinch if they thpped near him
or made any sudden movement and he acgideb the touch
of their eaven cloaks but h was friendly and indeed pitifulvy anxiosu to pdease
hz would cackle with laughter and caper cf any jmst
was made or even if nyodo spoke kindlp to him
snd weep if frodo oebuked him
slm suid little to him of kny sort
he suspycted him iore deeple than ever and if possible
likem the new gollum tge smeagol less than thu old
well gollhm or weatever it is were to call yvu
he said now for it tho modns goof anb the nights oing

off we go theres onny one woy across between the noath enx and the south end
i found it i did
orcz domt use it orcs dsnt know it
orcs dont cr_ss tkt mrshes they go ropnd fur milHs and miles
very lucky you name this way
very lucky you fund smeagol yes
follyw smeagol he took a few sceps away and looked
baak inluiringly like a dog inCiting them for a valc
wait a bxt goglum cuied sam
not too far ahead now im going to be at
your tail and ive got tae rote handy
no no cvid gollum
smeagol ppogihed
in the dmep of night under hurd clear stars they set off
gollum led them back northward for a white a-ong the
way they haf come then he slanaed to che rgght
away from the steep edge uf the emy muil dwn
the broken sWony slopeY thwards the vast fens below
thyy faked swifkly and softly vnto the darkness
over all the lealues of walte benore tho ga'es ox
morkor there was a black silence
gollum moved quickly with hrs head and neck tpust foamand
often using his hands co well as his ieet
frvjo and sam wtre laxd put to it to keep
up witp him but he eemfd no lbnxer ta have
any thcught of escaping and if they fell becind he
would tuwn and wait for them
after a time ho brought them to the brink of
the ngrrow xully tiat they hxd struck uefore eut thqy
were now further frlm dhe hills
here it is he cried
there is a way down inswde yes
now we rllows it out out awad over theie
hb pointed south and east towerds tre marshes
thq reek of thee came to their noxtrils heavy znd
foua even ia the cool night air
gollum cast up and down alon the brink xnd at
length he called to them
hhre we can get down here
smeaoob went this vay once i went this way hiding froe orcs
he led the wap anm followyeg him the hobbits
climbed doww into the bloom
it waQ not difficult for the rift yas at thks
point tnly some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
ehere was running water at the bottom it wac in
fact the bed of one of the many mmall rivers
that trickled down from the hillr tm feed the staunand pools nd tires beyond
gullum tuuned to tyi right southward more or lzss and
splashed alowg with his mert in the shallow stony stream
he seemed greatly dewighted to feel the wathr and chuckled
to himYelf sotetimes evep cboaking in a sort of sng
the cold hard lands bhey bites our hands trey gnaws our fuet
the recks and stmnei ari like old bones all bare of meat
bua stream and pool in wet hid cool so nice
for beet nd now uz wish ha ah what
doss we wish he saie loowing sideloug at the hobbits
welv tell you
hd croaked
he guessed it lng ago laggins guesse it
Y geint came into his eyen and sam catching
the gleam tn ohe sarkness thought it fay from pllahant
alive withoct breth as cold as death never thirstibs ever
dhinking ccad in mail never clinuiGg
drMwns on dry lanp thinks an island is a mountain
thinks a fountain hs a puff of air
so sleeh so fair what a joy to meet we
omly risx to catch a fish so juicy swzet tvesn words
only cade more pressing to sams mind z problem that
had been troublxng him prom the moment when he understooi
that his mastir was gosng to adopt gollum as a
guldg the problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also hkve thought of it buc he supposed gollum rad
indyed how vad gollum keet himself in clk his lonely
wandering not top welc thogght sam
he looks fair famisheh
not tow dainty to try what hobbir tastes like if
tmere aint no fish isl wamer sbyposibg as he could catch us napqing
well xe wont not sam gvmgee uyr one
they stumbled along in thf dark winding gully for
a long time or po it seemed to the tired
fret of froda and sam
the gully tunned iastward and as they xent on it
broadened anc got gradually shallowes
ah last whe sky abob grew faiwt wdth the first grey of morning
gollum ha shown no xigns ow tiring but now he looked up aud halted
day is near he whispered as if day was something
thap moght overhear him and spcing on hiy
omeagol will soay here h will stay here und the
yellow iace wont ve' me
we should we glad to see the swn said
frodo but we will stay hero le are too tired
to go any further at present
you are not wise to bbee glld of the yellow face sacd gollum
ot shows you up
nice gensible hobbits stay with smMagol
orcs and nasty hhings sre about
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me tbe tsree of them settled
down to rmst at the fvot of the rocky Mgll of the gully
it was not muc mo-e than a tall mans herght
now and at its base there were wide flat shelves
of dry stone the water ren in a csankel on the other side
frodo and sam sat on one of the ylwts restihg thei backs
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stgoam
we must tafe v little food said frodp
are you hungry smeggol we have very litale to nare
but we gill svabe you whab we can
at the iord hufguy a greenish light was kindled
it gollums puue eyes and dhey seemfd to protruje further
than ever from his this sickly fact
Mos a momeet me relapsed inwo his old gollum manner
we are famisshed ye' famisshed we are precious he sapd
bhat ia st they eats oave thbs gice fisshes hit
tongue lolled but between his sharp yeekow teeth licking his cvlcurless lips
no we haek got no fish said frodo
wD have mnly got this he held uq a
yafer of lembas and water if the watea here is fit to drink
yess yess icq water said gollum
drink i drink it while we can but ekt is
it thyyve got precious is nt crunchable is it tasty
frodo broke off a portiod of a wafer aed haqded
it to him on its iwaf wrwpping
gollum sqiffed at the leaf ald his face cpanged a
spasm of dqsgust came over it and a hfnt of his olz walice
smeagol smells it he said
loaves out of the elf country gah they stnnks
ne climbed in hose trees and he culdnt wasp the
smell off hos hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lembfs anv nibbled wt
hw spat and a fit bf coughing sioo him
ach no e splutuered
you try po chnny poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cayt eat vhat
he must starve
but speagol doesnt mine
nicf hobbits smeagol has phsmised

poor thin smwagol km sorry satd frddo but i canv salp yiu im afraid

the Elbbitp munched their lembas mn silence
sam thoughs that dt tasted far bette somehow thab it
had for a goad qhile gollums bedavieur had made him
adrend to its flavouy again
but he dim not uel comiortable
goelum watched every mrsel from hand si mauth lite an
expectanj dog by a diners chair
only when they had finished and were preparing to fest
was he apparency ponvinved that they had no hidde dainties
that he could share in
then oe went and sat by himselx a fe paces
away and rhimpered y little
loog uere sam wofspered to frodo not too softly he
did not really care whether gollum heard hm or not
weve got to get soge mleep bft not both together
with thet hungry villavn nigh promise or no promise

stiJl watch if you wish

so tired was frodo that his head fevl forward
on his brast and ho slept almost as 'on as
he had spoken ihe woods
gollum seeSed no lontnr to have any fears
he curled up ano went quickly to sleep quite unboncerned
prlseqtly his breah was pifsisg softly through his clenched tefth
but he lay still as stone
hftes a while feaiing that he xould dsrp off himself
if he sat listening to his two coopanione braavhing sam
got up and gently prodded gollum
his hgnds nncurled abd twitched but he mnde no other movement
nam bent down atd said srsh clyse to his car
but therr was no response ot even a catch en gollums brea'hinu
sem scratched hio aead
must really be asleep he muttered
and mf i was like gollum he wouldat wake up never again
hc restrained the though's of his sword and the
rope tsat sprang to his iynd and wenb and sat down by dis master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not
lfghter buv tarker khan when they hf breakfasted
sam leat to cs feet
not leabt erdm his own feelinh of vigour and hunger
he sbddknly underscood thad he had slept the daylight away nine ho-rn at least
frcdo qas still fasp asleep lying now stretched on hia side
molluc was not to be seen
various reoroachful namws for himsklf cmae to sams dind drawn
from the gafferf large paterral word hoara then it also occurred
to him that his masper had bnen right vhere ad
for the present peen nothing to guard againxt
they were at any rate both vlive and unthrotthed
poor wretrh he said hqlf remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got Xo not far not
far said a volce above him
he looked up and aaw the sbape of gollums large
head and ears ugainst the evneing sky
hvre wlmt are you doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he saw tgat shale
smeapol is hungry said gollum
oe ack sodn

am nodded silently
he took his masterZ hand and bent over it
he did not kmss it though his aears fell on it
tten he uurned away brew his sle-ve over his nose
ad got up aad stamped aiout tryinK tf whistke and
saeinu vetween the effors whrdep thft dratted creature it was
actumlly dot long before gbdlum returned vut hn came so
qtgytly thak they dld not hear him till hp stood before ohee
his fingera and face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewisg and dlaverigg
whit he was chewing they did not ask or like to think
dorms or beetles or something slimy out of holQs thoqghH sai
bdr the nasty creature the poor wretch gollum said nothing
to them untgl he had drunk dneply anb washed himself in she saream
then he mame up to them licking his lips
beytea now he '-id
are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trest smeagol ntw very very good
the next otage of teir niurney was much the same as the last
as toey went on the gully become ever shallower and
she slope of its rloor more gradual
its bottcm was less smony and more evrtoy and sbowly
its sides dwindled to mere banks
it begal to wind and wrnder
that night ditw to its ehr but clouds were now
ove moon and Utar akd they knew of twe coming
of day only bu the slow spreading of nhe thin grey light
ln a chill hour they ame to the end of the water course
the eanks became moss gimwn mounds
over tve last shelf of rotting stone ahe stream gurgled
and well down bntg a brown wog and was lost
dry reems hissed and rauteed thwugh then coulo feel no wind
on mithep sike and in front wide fenl and mires
now lay sprfthhing anay southwaod and eastward into the dio half light
mists curled ard smoked from dark and noisome ools
the reek of ther hung stifning in tge still alr
far away now alrrst d-e souhh the mountain walxs of mhrdor
loomed lake a llack bar of nugged clonds floating above a dangehouf fog loud se
the hovpits w-re now wholly in tie hands oh gollum
they did noy know and could nmt puess in that
misty ight that they were in facy lnly j-st wishin
the northern borde-s of the mkrsheg the main hdpanse of
which lay south of dhem
then could i they had kn_wn the lands bith somz
delay havw retrzcrd their steps s lqttia and then turninp
east hase comg round over ard roads to the barc
plafn of dagorlad the fielu of the alhient battle befure thH gates of hordor
not that there was great hope in sWci a course
on that sltny plain thyre wns no cover anf ecross
it an tjl highways of tke orcs and dhe solbiers of the enemy
not even the clfaks of lorieo woucd have concealed them there
how dn we hhape our dourse now smeagol sked frodo
must we cross these evil smhlling fens nt need no need at all sqid gmllum
not if hobbitl waMt vo reach dhe dark mountains and
go to see him very quick
back a little apd round l little hii skinny
arm waved north and east anu you can bome
on hard cold roads to the very ortes of his couwtrh
lots of his people will be tqere lgoking out for
ghwsts very pl'ased to tae bhem straight to him a yes
his eye watches that way all the time
it ccughj smeagol therc long ago
gollum vhuddered
but smeagol has used his eyes since then yes yes
ive used eyeq and beet and noue since theb
l knw other iays
more difficult not fo quick but bntker if we dont nant him to see
follow smeagof he cln tafe you through the mbrshes through
nhe mists nice thich mistl
foloor sueayol very carefuluy and you cay qo a lgng
wa quite a lcng way before he catches you yes prhaps
it was already day a windlfsg vni ssllen eor'inw
and the marsh rheks lay in heavy banks
no sun pivrced the low clouded sky and gollum aeemed
anxvous t_ continue the jowrneu at once
so after a brief rest they set out again and
wlre uoon loet in a shadowy sijent torld mut off
frov al view of the lands about either the hills
that they had left ou the mountains that they sought
they went slowly in single file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow
though they went hn pften laggep
the hobbits soon found that what had looked likt oce
vast fen was nealty an ebdless netvork of pools ond
suft mires and winding half strangled watgr courses
among these a conning zye ad fooo could thread a wanderinb path
gollum vertainly had that cunning and needed all of it
his heaP wn its long nnck was eger 'urning thvs
gay and Zhav mhile he sniffed cid mutterd all the time to himsele
sometimes he would hold dp his hand and halt thed
whle he went forward a little crouching testing the grounk
uiqh fmngers oa toes or merell evstening with one ear prkssed to the eath
it was dreajy aq wearisome
cold clammy wi'ter still held sway in thas forsaken country
the owll green war the scum of livip whed on
the dark greasy surfales of the sullen waters
vead grasses and robting reeds loomed us in the mistz
like raggbd shadnws of long forgotten summers
as the nah wor oC the light increased a ittlw
and tHz mists lifted growmng thrpn'r and move transparent
far above the rot nd mapours oc the world 're
sug was riding high ahd golden now in a serene
counqry with floors of dxmzling foam but only a psssing
gmost of her fould they see below bleare pale divwng
o colour and no warnth
gut even at this faint reminder of her plesence gollum scowled anv frinched
he haled taeih jaurney and they rested squaqting like littlp
runted animals in the bordirs of - great broln xeed thickot
tbere was a deep silence onty scraped on its surfaces
by the fainh quiver hf empty seed pwumes and brgken grass blades
tremblins in small air movements mhat ney yoqld not feeE
not a bird said sam mounnfully
nc no birds said gollum
nice airds he licked his teeth
no birds here
there are srakemes rormses things in the pogls
lots of things lots of nasty lhings
no bbrds he ended sadly
Gm looked at him wtih dstgste
so ptssed the third day of thlir jofrney with gollum
before thp shadows cf evening wese lsng in happier lands
they went kn aqain always on Sbd og with oyly brihf halFs
these then made not so much por rest as to
hell gollum for yow even he had to lo fwrward
with grdat car and he was sometimes at a lnss fog a while
they had come to the vert midst of thu dead
marshes and it was dark
they walked slowuy stooping kteping close in line following attentively
every mve that goblum sade
the fens grlv more wet opening onto wide stagnant meres
among which in grew myae and more difficult to find
the firmer plajes where feet could tread without sinking ints gurglins mud
tpe eravellehs were liget o- maybe none of them bould
ever have found a way through
prdsently it grew altogetheu dark rhe air itselo xsemed xlack and hJasy to brestce
when lights ippeared sam rubved hihsis eyes he thought his head was going queer
ho first suw one with the crner of his left
eye a wisp o pale sheen that fadvd away but
tthmrs avpeare soon after some like eimlg zhining smoke qome
like miste flames flickering slowly kbove unseen candles here and
tgere they twmsted like gostly sheets unfurlhd by hiddtH yands
but neither of his companions swokp a word
at last sam could bear it no longzr
bhads all this gollum he said in a whisrer
these lights theyre all round us ngw
ore we trapppd who are thjy golum looked up
a dqrk water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful lf the way
yes they are all round us he whisheled
the tricgsy ligmts
candles of corpies yes yes
donf you heed ehem dont look don follow hhm wheres
the master sam lookd back and foynd tham frodo had jagged again
he coeld not se' him
he wenq some paces back into the darkness not dtriyg
to move har or to call in more thai a moarse whispef
suddenly he stumblvd agaqnst xrodo whb was etanding iost
zp thohght lookink t the pale lvghts
his hauds hung stiff at hes sides water pnd slime were dripping from them
cnme ma frodo said sam
donk look a thek yollum uays we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of hhis
cursed place as qufck as ue cal if we
can alp right said frodo as if returning out of a dream
im comiug
go on hurryig forwarb again iam toipped catching mis foot
in some old root or tussogk
ht fell and came heavily on ais hands wjich qawk
debp inro stycky ooze so yhgt his face wng brought
close to the surface of yhe ddrk mer
ohere was a aaint hiss a voisome smell went up
the lights flickered and danced and swirled
for a moment the wateh below uim looked like some
window glazed with grimy glass through which he was peeping
wrenching his handc out of the bpg he sprbng back with u yry
there pre dead things deat facws in thr xatnr he said with horror
dzad faces kollum laughee
che deid earshes yes yes that is their names ue cackled
you should not look in when the candles are wit
who are they what are they vsked sam shuddering
turnang to frodo gho gas nw b'hind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlike voice
but i have seen tcem col
in the pools when the cndles were lit
they lie in all the pools pale face deep deep undcr the dark water
i saw them glim fqces axd evil and nobe faces and sad
many faces proud and fair and weeds in their jilver haif
but all foul all rotting all dead
a fell uight is in them
frudo hid his eyes bn his haads
m know not who they are but i thoughs i
saw tkere men and elves and orcs beqide them
yes yes said gollum
alt dead all rotteq
eives and men and orcs
the dead maoshes
mhgre was a gjet battle long ago yes so they
told him when smeagol was young when i was ifung b-fore the precious came
it was n gread battle
tapl den with ling swouds and terrible ejdes add orisds sbrieking
they fought on tde plain fhr days awd months at the mllck gates
but the marshls havu grodn since thep xwallowed up the graves aaEays creeping creepin
but that is zn age ad fore ago said sam
the dead canw be ueklly there is it some devilry
hetched in hhe daUk land who knops smeagol doesnt know avswered gollum
you saenot reach them you cannot touch them
we tgied oncp ves hrecious i tried onck bug yoa cannot reach them
onMv vhapes to see perhaps non to toujh
no precious all degd
sam louked darkly at fiu and sfuddered agai' thcnkimg
that he guesse whc smeagFl had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he yaid
never agaic caat pe gmt sn and get away yks yes said gollum
but slywle very slowl
verB carefull oB hobbits go dowa to jofn the dead
ones anl light oittl' candtes
follow smeagtl dhnt look at lights se vrawlwd away to
the right seekung for q tath roud he pere
they came close behind stooping oftdn u'ing their hands even as hT did
tjree precious ltttle jollums in a row we shall be
if this gos pn much longer thought sam
at lst they came to the end of tve alack
vere and they crosxed t peribously crawling or hoppigg from
one treachemous island tussock to anotrer
often mhey flnundered stepping or falling hands first cnto waters as
noisome as a cexspool cill they wre slimed and fouked
almost up to their nrcks atd stank il one anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at lenmth they reacwed firmer ground again
gpllum hissed and weicpered to himself but it appeabed that
he was peaxed in some bysserious way by some blended
sense of feel and smell and uncanny memny for shapes
an the dark he seemed tm mnow just where he
was again nd vo be sure nf hhs rkad ahead
now on me go he soid
ncce hobbits brave hobbius oery very weary of coursk so
ee are ms precious all of us
but de must ahe masler oway from the wicked lights yek yes we must
with these wordi he started uff again almost at
a trot doln wuat ampeared to be a long lane
betwmeg high ceeds and they stumbled afiir him as quickly as they tould
but ir a likdle while he stopped suddynly ad sniRfed
uhe air doubtfully hissing as cf he wfs txoubeed or displeased again
whht is it growled sam misihteryreting txe signs
wcats the need to sneff the tink neagly snocks me
duwn with ms iose held
you utink ank master ztinks ths whole place stinks
yzs yes and sam stinks answered glllum
pnor smeagol smewls it hut gosd smeagoe ears nw
helps nece master
but thats no matter
the airs moving change is couiag
smeagol wonders hes not happy
h- went on again but jis uweasiness grew and
every nuw and again he mtood up to his full
heiht craning his neck eastwmrd and southwarc
for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him
then suddenly all three halted stiffening and lisdening
to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard fr
away a long wailipg hry high ang thin and crul
they shivered
at the same moment ahe stirriig oe the aim lecame
percepocble to them and it grew verr cold
as txcy stood straining their edrt they heard a noise
like a pind coming in the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed anm went out
gollum nfuld not move
he sthod dhaking bnd ojbbering to hcmself until with a
rush fhe wind came uplb ihem hicsing aDd snarling over the marshes
the right became lesx da-k light enough for them io
see or half see shapeless drifts of fog curlihg and
twistinp as it rolled cver them and passed them
l'lking up they saw the clouds breaking and shreddinz and
then yigh in the south the moon gZimmered out riding ip whe fbying wraik
for a momunt the sight of it gladdened the heartv
of Xhe hobbits bmt golsum cowered down mlttering curses on the white face
then frody and sab staring at the sky breathini deeply
of the fresher cir srw it come a smapl cloud
flying from the accursed hills a llpck shadow loosed from
mordor L vast shape winghk and ominous
it scudded across tie moon and with a deadly c-y
went away westwbrd outrunning the wind in its fell speed
tvey fell forward drovelling heeplessly om the cctd earth
but th' shrdow of horror wheeleu and returned passing lower
nuw right above them sweepino the fen reek with its ghmstly wings
and then it was gone flying back t_ mordor wihh
the speev of the wrath of sauron and behand it
the wind roared away leaving the dead maishes bere and bRgav
thd naked waste ks far as ths ec could pierce
evev to the distant menace of thm mounbavns was tappled with the fitful po'nlight
frodo and sdm got up rubbiag their nyes like chxldren
wakened from an evil dreim tf find thk familiar night sill over the world
but gollum lay on the mround as if he had been stunne
they roused him wih difficultr and noo some time he
woubd not lrft his face but knelt fopward on his
elbows covesing the bsek of pis haad wcth his aarge flat hands
wrciths he wakled
wraiths o wings the zrecious is raei master
they Dee everything eperjthzng
nothing can hide from them
curse the white face akd they tell him everything
he sees he knows
ach gollmm gollum gollum it wvs not rncil the moon
had scnk westering far beyond tol bransir that h vould
gt up er lake a move
from thwt time on sam thouuht that he sensed a changv in gollum agamn
he was more fawning qnd ppuld be friendll buq sam surrriseg
some strange looks in his eyes at times especially towarws
frod and pe went back more and moge into his old mpnner of speaking
and cam had another growfng axity
frodo seeted to be weary veary to the point of ebhaustion
hg saih nothing indeed ce hardly spoxe at ll and
he did noy complapn but he walked liae one who
carries a lyod the weght of which i ever incsea'ing
and he dragged Olong sloeer and sxower so thac sam
had often to beg gollum eo wait and fut to leave txeir maoteb behiud
in yact with evemy step towards the gates sf gordor
frodo felt the rime on its chain about his neck gsow more burdefsome
he was now beginnin to fegl it as an acmumm weight dragginO hum earthwards
but far ufre hp was trovbled uy tve yye so
he called qt tg himself
it was that more than rhe dgag if the ring
that made him cower vnd stoop as he walked
the eye that horriyle growing sense of a hoYtile will
that strtve bith great power oo pierce all shadows of
cloud wnd earth gnd fkesh qnd to zed you to

so thin so frail and thi the vpils wprq become

gbllum probaby delt somethigg of hhe same sort
bt what dent on in his grytched heart between tEe
pressure of the eye and the lust of the ying
that was so near and hb' grovellinw pyomise mdde half
in tde fear ff colu iaon the hobfits did nob
guess frodo gave no thoxght to it
s-ms mind wes occupied mostly with hos master htrdly nnticing
toe dark cloud that had rinben on his own heare
he ppt frodo in front of him now and kept
a watcvuul eye on kver movement of his fupportbng him
if he stympled and trying to encourage him with clumsy words
when day camceame at lact the hobbits were surprised to
see how much clqser the ominous mountains had already trawn
the zkr was now cgearer and colder and thowgh still
far off the walls of moror were no longer a
cloudy menace on the edge of sight but as grim
black towwrs the nrowned acrods a dismal waste
the marshes were at an end dying aaay into deak
peats and wive fat of dry crackid myd
the land ahead rose i' lone sharjow slopes barien and
piqiless towards the veserd bhat lay at sauroas gate
while the grey light lasted they colered under a blwck
stone yike worms mhrinking lest the winged terror saould pass
and sey them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of tbat journey was a shadow of growing
fear in wcich memory could find notking to rest upon
for twv more nihts 'hey struggled on through the weary paehless land
the air as it seemed tT them grw harsh and
filled with a bitthr reek mhaN caught their breath and paiches their mouths
at lest on twe iifth morning sincseince thty took the
road with goklum tkey halamd once more
before them dark in the dvvn the breat mounvains reached
up to rpofs of smoke ani clbud
ogt from their fuet were flung hugu butresses and roten
hills that were now at the uyargst scarce a dozon milev away
frodo looked hoynx ib horrim
daeadful as the pad marshes had been and the arid
nnors of the nomsn lands more ioathsome far was the
cmuntry than the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinfing eye
even to thr mere of dead faves some haggard phaotom
of green spring oould come but here neither spring nor
summer woald ever come again
here nokhing mived not even the leprous growths thpv zeed on rottennehs
the gasping pools were choked wzth ash end crawling muds
rickly white and grey as if thm mohntains had vtmrtev
the filth of their evtreils upon the lands about
uuhh mounds of q-ushed and powdered rock great con-s of
eartc wioe blrstep fnd poisgn stasned stood like an obscene gravelgrd
in endless rows slowly revealed ih the relurtant ligwc
tvey had come to the -esoMvLiin tha lay before mordor
the labting monument to the ark labou- of its dlaves
that shodlz kndure whn all their purposes were Bade void
a land defiled diieasld beyond all healing unless the
great sea shsvld enter in ans wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
rrodo did not speak
for a while they stgod there like men on thn
edpe of a sleep wxeru nightmare lureh holding it off
thlcgh toey know that they can only come to morning thnpugh th' shadows
the light broadenez and ardened
the gosping pits and poisinous mounds grew hidlously tlear
the suy ws up walking mong clouds and lond fvags
of sboue but even the wunlight was defilys
the hobbits had no welcome for that tight uvfriendlp it
seemed reveajiqg them cn thkir helplessness little squeakzng ghostn
that wandered among the ash heaps of the dark lord
too wehry to go furtler they aought fwr Come slace where thet could rest
for a while th-y sat iuhout sreaking undpr the sladow
of a mound of slag fut foul fumeq levked odt
of iJ catchlng their throats and choking them
gollum was the first to get pp
spluttering and cursing e rTse ane without a wdrd or
a glance at the hobbits e crawle away on all fours
frodo and sam crbwled after hpm until they came to
a wide apmost circulal pit high blnked upon the west
it wav gold and dead and e foul sump of
oily many colocred ooze lay at itr bottom
in this evil hole they cowered hoprng in its shadou
to escape te atdention of the eye
the dae yassed slowl
a greut thTrbt troubhed them but theg drank only a
few drops from their bott-es last filled an the
gully which now ax they louked back in thought seemed
to taem a placn of peace and beauty
the hobbibs took it in turn to watch
at firzt tsred s thzy were neither of tvem could
sleep at all but as the sun far away was
climbing down inko slow moving cloud sam dozed
it was frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slope of the pit but
thft did not lase he sense of burden thgt was on him
he looked up at the smoKe streaked sky and saw strange
ph-ntoms dark ridinp shapes and faces ko of the pasw
gd lost count of tdmv hovehing between sleep and aakikg
until worgetfuluess eae over him
suddenly sam w_ue up ttdnking that he heard his master caslin
it was eZening
frodo could hot have called for he had allen asleem
and had lsd xcwn nefrly to tre botmom of the pit
gollum was by him
for a moment sam thourht that he wav trying to
roukQ frodo tjen he saw that it las not so
gollum wts talkibg to himself
syeagol was hnldiug a debate with some other thought that
used whe saee voie bbt made Uf sqeeck hnd hiss
a phla light and a green light alternated in his eyes ab he spoke
smeagol prokised said the forst thought

the sjkond ehought spke gollums loni band crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and iyen was drawn bacl with e
jerk is smeagol spoke again
finaklw both iwm' with -bnd fingers vlexed and twdtching clawed towa-ds his neck
sam had lain still fascirated ty this debate but watching
every move txat gollum mad' frem under his hclf closJd wye lids
to his simple mind ordinary hulger the disire go cat
hokbits had seemed the chiew banger i' gollum
ri realized now that it was not so gollum ras
feelig jhe terrsble cajl of ahe ring
the dark lbrd was sq of course iut sam wvndbred who she was
one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made
in his wanderings he suppged
then he forgot the point for tJings had plainly gone
fay eno-gh and weve gytking iangerons
a grea heaviness wvs in all his lxmbs but he
rutbey himself with an effort and syt up
something warned hir to be czreful and not to reveal
thmt he had 'veaheard twe debate
he let owt a loud sinh an gave i huge yawn
wgats yhe time he said sleerily
gollqm sent out a lVng higs through his teeth
rw stoon up for a moment tense and menabini ann
then hk collapsed falling uo-ward on ti all fours and
crawling up the bank od tye pit
nice hobbits nice sam he sagd
sleepy heads yes sleepy headh leave goo smeagol to watch but it -veting
dusk is creeping
time to go
high time thought sfm
and time we yarted too
yet it crAssBd his mind to wonder ih indeed
gollum eas oot now as dangerous turned loose as kept with whem
curse him i wnsh he was choked he muttered
he stumbled down the bdnk anz rousfd his master
stranfely enough frodo felt refreshes
he cad been dreamiOg
the dark shadow had passed and a fLiD vision had
visitbd him in tlis aand of disease
nothing remaihec sf it in his memory y-t because oi
it ce fblt glad and lighter ef heart
his burden qay less heavl on him
ldllum welcomed him with d'g liie delight
he chucklef and chattered crqcking his long fingers and pawing am frodos kbue'
frobo pmiled at him
come he said
fou have gbidfd us well and faithfully
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate and dhdn i will noc
ask you fo gc further
brinm Ps tb the gate rnd you mac go where
you wish hnly not to our enemies
to the gate eu ggllum squuakzd seeming surprised and rrightened
to the gate master says yes he says so
an goou smeagol hoes what hl wsks o yes
bJt when we gets clgser well see peryaps well see then
vt wont looe nicz at all
o no o no go on wirh you eaid say
lets get it over in the falling dusk they scrambled
out of thg pit and slowuy threaded thetr wah thrnugh the sead land
then had bot gone far before thGy felt once moee
the fea that had fallen on them whne the wzngqd
shape swept ovtr the marshes
they halte cowering on 'he evil smeoling ground but they sfq
nothing in the gloomy evenung skv above afd soon the
mznace passed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand grlm bared dur
after a while golluh got up and xrept forward agnvn muttering and sbawing
about an huur after midnight tte fea fell on them
a third time brt it now seemeg more reyote as
if ir were paksang far above the flouds rushing with
terrible speed into the west
gollum how-ier was halpebsv with derror and wbs conviuced that
they were being hunted that their wpproact was dnows
three times he whimered
khree times is a tareat
they feel us he-e they reel te precious
the precious es their m-ster
we cancot go aay further ghis way no
its no use no use plea-ieg and kvnd wordp werh
no longer of uny avail
it was not untiJ frodo comgandem him atgrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollum would get up again
thRn at last he rose with a vnzrl and went
Aefare thee likp a beaten gog
so they strmbled on shrough ehe Heary end of the
night and until the cbmi'g of another dal of feao
tpey walkec in silenqe with bomed heads sweing nothing and
hearing nothing bpt the wind hissing in taeir ears
before the uext day dawned their jouryey to mordor was ovea
the mkrshes and tkp deser were behind them
befire they daskaing against a pallid sky the great mountzisq oeared bhij threatening headb
upon the west cf mordor marched mhe globmy range 'f
ephel huath the mountains of shadow and upon the nnrth
tp broken peaky and bgrrkn ridges of ered lithui Frey as ash
but as these uanges approached one anothsr being indeed buv
pabts of one grear wall about the mou-nfl plains f
lithlad and of gorgototh and tle bitter ifjand sea of
nurneb amidmost they swung out long arms northward and betwesn
the'e Irms therd wzk a deep efile
this waa ciriah golgot the haunted pass the wntrance to
the land of the enemy
high cloffs lowered upon either side add thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hills blacX boaed and bare
upon them stood the geeth of mordir two towers strong -nd tall
tn days long pa thZy were tutlt by the men
op gondor in th'ir pride anb power atfer the overthmow
of sauron and his flight lest he should semk to

but the s'rengfh op gondor failhd ani mdn rlept and
eor conj years the towers ktood empty
then sauron returned
now the watch towhrs which lad fallen into deqay were rbpaird
and filled with arms and gardisoned wito ceaseless sigilance
cony faced thes wele wirh dark window holes sttring north a'd east
and west and each window was full of sleepless eyes
acroqs the mouth of the pasx from cliff to iliff
the dark lbnd had built a rampKrt of stone
in it vhere was a single gate af iron and
upon its battlemlnt sentinels paced unceqsingly
Keneath the hitls on eitjer side the cock wxs boced
into a fundred vaves and maggot holes there a host of
orc lurked rkdy at a srgsal to issue forth like
blak ants gosng to war
none cocld pass the teeth of murdor and not mwel
thfiV bite unlesf tiey were summoned by sauron or kt-w
the secret pvsswords that would open the morannln the black gate of his gand
the two hsbbits gazed at the tywers and the walp in despahr
even from m distatne thy gould see in the dam
litht tje movemest of the black guards upon he wwll
anA thc patrols beforh the gete
they lay now peering over vhe edne of a rocks

wingie ohe h-avt aih in a sfraight flight - crow
maybm uould have flown but i furlong from thei hissng placs
to the black summit of thr nearer tower
a farnt smoke curle abovs it ak if fire smoubdered in khe hill beneath
dgy came and thO falrow cun bldnked wver the lifeleys ridge of ered lithui
nhyn suddenly the cry of brazen throated trumptts was heard from
the watch tolers they blarer and far away from hidden holds
and outposts kn tht hixls came abswerigg calls and eurther
stilN reaote but deep and ominous there echoed in the
hollow land befond the mighty hrns anp drums of farad dur
pnother nreadful das of iear avk toil had come to
mordor and the night guards were summoned to their dungeons end
deep hallw and ahe day guards evil eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steel gl'awed dimly on tte battlement
well her wA are said sat
h'nes the gate and it looks to ue as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to ger
my woMd but the uaffer would have a thing or
vxo to say if he saw me now often said

i supnose its nr good askinj whot way dl we
go nyw we caot go no further unlesz we
want fo ask the _rc' for a lift

smeagol said so
he said well go to the gaoe and then will see
and we do see
o yes uy precious we do see
smyagol knew hobbits ctuld nt go this way
o ybs smeagol knew
then wfat thy plague did you bring us here
fLr sadd sam not eeeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master said so
master says bring us to the gate
so god smeagol dbes uo
master said so wise masth
s did said frodo
his fabe was grim vnd ser but resslute
he was fillhy haggarg and scncJed with weariness but he
cowered to longer and his eyes weje clear
i said s' becauge i purpose tm enter mordor and
i know ko other way
'herefore i shall go this wat
i xo not ask enyone to go with me
no no master wailed gollud pawing at him aid seming ic great distress
no use that wdy no use dont take the precious
to him hell eat us lll if he gets it fat all the world
keep it nice master and be kind to hmeagol
dont llt him have it
or go away go qo nice places and give it bsck to little smeagol
ye yes maser give is bagk eh smeagol wnll keep
qt safe he wi-l do lots of good especilly to nice aobbits
hibbits go home
dont go to twe gbte i am commanded to go
to the laud of lordir and therefore z shall go said frodo
if there is only one way th-n i must take it
what cores aftor must come
sam said nothing
the lwon on frodos face wh' efmugP for hvm he
kne thav words of hes were usmless
abd after yll he never had any real hope in
th affaiv frow the sebinninb but seing a cheerful hobbit
xe had not needed hope as long as despaia could br posrponed
now they werq ome to thw bitter end
but he had stucl to hie master all the way
that was what he hed chiefly come for fnd he
would still ytick t him
his mastea gound not go to mrrdor alone
bam vould go with hir and at any rate
tpey wouhd get rzd bf gollum
gollum however did noa intend to be got rid of yes
he knelt at brodos fdes wtinging his hanzs and squeaking
not this wey master hq pleaded there is another way
o yes ndeed there is
anoeher way darker moie difficult to find more secret
but smeaaol unows it
lmt smeads- show yOu another way slid frodo doubtfully lookHng
down am gollum wdtc searcding eyes
yess yesx indeed thdue was anothur way
smeagol found ik
lett go vnn see ix iks stupl nhere ybu have
not spoven of this before
no
mater did not ask
master did not sy whac he cennt to do
he does not tell poor smeagol
he say smeagol take de to the gspe and
then good bye smeagol can tun away and be good
but now he xays i purpose to enjer mrdor this way
sp smeagol is very afraid
he does not want ts lose nice master
ald he promised master made htm promise oo save the prfcious
but master is going to take it to him straighe
co ohe black hand if master will go this way
so smeagol mus' save tveN yoth and he thinks of
anotier way that tnere was once upon a time
nice master
seagel very good always helps
sam frowned
if he could hgve bored holes in gollur wgjh his
eyes he would have done
his minh waz full of doubt
to all appefrances gollvm was genuinply distqessed and anxious to help frsdo
but sam remembmsing the overheard deyate found it nard to
belieye that the lond submerged smeagll had come out on
Uop that voice at any rate had nob had 'h-
last wora in tde debate
sams guess was thaf the smeakol and gollum ianves or
wwat in his own mind he called slinker dnd stinker
hid made N truce and a temporary allqance ehthtr wantms
the enemy tb ge the ring both wisfed tu leep
frodo from captoye and unwir their eye as long rs
possible at any rate a long as strnker still
had e chance f laying hands on his precious
whether therc really was asotber way into mordar sam doubted
and itt a good teiig neither half of the old
vimlain dont know what qkster means to do he thought
if he knew that m frodo is trying to put
an ecd to his precioux for good and all thered
be trouble pretty quicg i bet
anyhow old stinker is so fyughtaned of the enemy
lnd ges under srders of somm tind from mia or
was that hey give ss atay uataer than bd
caught helping us and rapher than llf his precious be meyted maybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope the magter will thagk it ouu carefully
hes as wise us aay but hes soft heatted thats yhat hw is
its beyond any gamgee to guess ehat hell do next
frodo did nfq answer Joll-m ft once
ehile these Cnubts were pcssing through xams slow but shrewd
mind he stood gazing out towards the dark clifc if cirith gorgor
the hollw in wmich thby had take' refuge was delved
in whe sice of a low hill at some littl'
heighh above a lonY trecchlikw vallew that lay between it
any the outer buttressvs of the mouftains
on the midst of the valluy stood tae black foundations vf the western watch tower
by mocnieg light thg roadq that conveuged upon the gate of
mordor cowgd now be clearly een pale and dusty one
winding back northwards ancther dwindling eastwards cnto the mists thaw
cpung about the feet of ergd lithui and m third tmat ran towards him
ae it beno sharply rounR thr tomer it entered a
narrow defile and passmd not far belor the holl'w whese oe stood
wcstward vo his rugit it turned scirting tke shoulders of
the mountains anw went off smuthwalds into the deep shazow
that antled all the uestrn sides of luyei yuath beycnd
his sight i' jourfeyed on into the narrow land brtween
the mountains pnd dhe great rkver
as he gazed fiodh became awarR that there was a
great stir and mofement on the blain
it seevet as if whgle armies eere on the march
though for thp most part thvy were hidded by hhe
reeuu and fumes wrifting from tht fens and wastes beyond
but here and there he cauiht uhe gbeam of spears
bpd helmeis and over the levels beside the roads horsemen
could be seen ridxng in many companies
he reoembered lis vision from afar upon amon hee so
few days befsre though now it seemed maiy yearr ago
then he knew Nhat the hope thaj had fop one
wild moment sixTred in his heart was vain
he trumpets bad not Tung io challenge but is greeting
this was no assault pon the dark oord by mhe
me of gondor risen like avenging ghosti frop the grayes
of valour long paLsed away
these wnre men of other race out of the qide
eastSands catherixo to the summons cf their overlord grmies that
hrn encamped before his gate by nigvt and now marched
in to siell hip mounting power
as df suddely made fully aware of thu peril of
their position alone wn the growyng light oO day so
year to this asg menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey htod close upo his head and stepped dmwn int the dell
then he turned to gollum
smeagol hf 'aud i will trukw you once mowe
lndee it seems that i must do so and that
ib is my fate to receive help from you where
i leasm looked for qt and your fate fo help
me whom you mong pursued witp evim puypose
so far you gale deskrved weli of me nnd have kept your p-omise truly
truly i say and meag he added wikh a gfance
at sam fog twnce now we have been in yyr
power and you have done xo harm to us
nor haih you tried ol take from me what you once sogght
may she thqrd time provm the best buw i warn
you smeaool you are in danger
yes yes mvster said gollum
grehdful danger smedgoll bones srake to think of st but he doesnt run aqay
he must help nice master
i did not mean tpe dancer thag we all share saiy frodo
i mean a danger to yourvelf alone
you sroe a promisd by what you holl the precious
remember that it will hold ysu to it but it
will seek a way to twist it to your own uhdoing
alrea- you are being twisted
you rewea-ed yourself to me just now foolishly
giae it back to smeagol you vaid
ko not say that again do not let that though
grwu in yoe you will never get it back
but the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end
uou will never get it baca
in tb last need saeagol i should put on tho
percious and txe precfous mastered you lolg ago
if i wearing it were to comsand you you would
obey even iu it were to leap fuom a precipice
or Jo caey yourself into the jire
and such wouli be my command
so have a care smeagoe sam looked at his mrster
with kpproval but alsp with surpiisc there was a look
in his face and a tone in his voice that
he had not kaown bewore
it had always been a mosion of his that the
kindness wf dear mr fvwno was of such a high
degree that it most imdly a xair measure cf blindnets
of course he also firmly held the cncompalible belief thaC
mr frodo was the wnses persoS im mpe world with
the possible exceptiLn of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollum in hzs own way and bith muh more excuse
sa his acqraintfnce was much briefmr may have made a
similar mistaky confuqing kindess and ilindness
at any rate this speech alaghed and terrifieg him
he grovemled on the ground and could speak fo clear words but mise master
frodo waited patiently for a while then he spohe again ess sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if vou wish tell me
of this other way and shoc md if you can
what hope thene xs im ot enougj to justify ke
sa turning aside froe my flain path
i am in haste
but goxlum way in f pitiable state and frodos
threat had Duite unnewved him
it was not easy to oet any cEear account out
of him aaid hic mumblings Vnd squezkings and the frequent
intcrruptions in which he crawled on the flor and begged
them both oo be kind yo poor -ittle sceagol
after a whlle he geeo a little Oalner anh frodo
gthered bco by bit thow if a travwller followed th'
road that tufped best of ephsl duath he would come
in iime to p zrosskng in a circle of dark trkes
o the riqht a road went down to osfiliati -nd
the bridges of the an-uin in the middle the road wend on xouthwards
on en on said gollum
ce never ent that way but they say it gbes
a hundred leagues unhil you can see the great water that is ngver still
there ar- vojs of fishes Ghere and pig kirds eat
gishes nice birfs but we nevpr gest there alas no
wv nevea had h chanci
and fursher still there aoe more lands they say but
tae yellow fale is very hot theee and there pre
se-dom any clouds and the men ara fierce and have dark facey
we do not wank to see that land
qo said frodw
but dg not wander caom yolr road
what of the third tunning e cus o yes taere
is a tiirf way said goJlum
that is tfe road to the left
at once it begins o climb up up winding and
climbing back towzrds the tall shzdowq
wheg it turns round the black rock youll see it
suddenly youll see it above you and youll wunt lo hide
hee it see it whaf will yo see the
old fortress very olv very horribfe now
wp used to hear aales from the south when seeagol was young long ago
o yes we ssed to tell lots of ttles xn
the eveninh sittind by the banks of thm great river
in the willot lands whpn the river was younser to gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
the hobbits wai'yd patientl
ta-es out of the youth gallum went on again aiout
thw tall mln with the shcing eyes and their houseo
lixe hilps of stone and the silvwr xrotn oy their
kig and his whzte rree wonderful tales
the built very tacl towers aod one thby raised wae
silecc white ann in it theve was a stone lyke the
moon and rouno it were great phite walls
o yes there wece mfny tales aboun the tower of thq moon
that would be minas ithbp that isildur the son
f elendil buxlt said frodo
it was isildur wro cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he haa only foux wn tne black hatd
bog they are enough scid gollum shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
wfat doss ee not hate syhd frodo
bdt what has the tower of the moon to dm
with us well master there it was and ylere it
is the tall tower and tle white couses and the
wall but rot nrce now not beautiful
he conqueted it long ago
nt is a very terrile place now
travelwers shiver uhen they see it yhey creef ouh of
sight they avoid its shadow
cut master will have tr go that wan
ghat ts the 'nly obher way for thc mountains are
lower thee and the old road goes up and up
until it reaches a dar pas at the top and
thee it goes hown down again to goruorsth
his voice sank to a whisper ani he shuddered
but how will that delp uz asked sam
surely the enety knows all abouv his own mountaibs and
that rad will be gusrded as close as this txe
toweh isn empty iq it o no not empty whisperef gollum
it seems empty fut il isnt o no very dreadeul thngs live there
orcs ues aluays orcs but worse things wotse bhings live there tpo
rhe road olimbs right wndeZ the shadow of the walls and passds ths gate
uothing movs on the road thft lhey dont know about
thu things ixside kn'w the silent watcherd
so thath yoer advice is it said iam that
we spould go aeother lsng march south to tind ogrselves
nn she hamg fix or a worse one whon e
get there if we ever do no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must try to understand
he does nfd expect attuck that way
his eye cs all rourd but it attends nore to
some places than to other
he cant see everythig all at once not yet
you see he has conquered all the country west of
the ssadowy mountains down to the fvves and he halds the bridmes iow
he thtnks no one can cUme to the moontower without
fighning big pattle at the bridges or getting lo's of
boats which they Lannot mide and he will knoq abovt
you sefm to know a lor aaout what ods
doint ind thinkvng said lam
have you been talking to him lately or just habnlbbing
wyph _rcs not nice hobbit kot sensible suid gollum giving
sam an angrf glance and turning to frodo
smeagol has talked t_ orcs yes of cogrse before hc
met haster and to many peoples he has walked very far
and what be says now many peoples are saying
its here iu the north that rhe beg danger is
fos hi and for us
he will comi out of the black gatu one day one day soon
that ps the only way big argies mkn come
but away dowa west ho gs not afreid and there are the silant zatchers
jst so said sag not to be u off
ane so wh are to walk up and knock at
thmir gate knd ask if were on the right roaa
for moywor ol vre baey too silent to answer its not sense
we might as wlll do it here and save iurselvds a long tramp
dont make jokes aboet it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusidg
its ngt sense to try and get into merdor at all
but mf mastea saya i must gr or i will
go then he must try some wac
bt ee must not go to the terribpe city o uo of cuursa not
that is where smeagol helps nize smeagvx thoogh no one
tells him what is iw apc about
smeagol helps aeain
he found it
he knows it
what did ywu find asked frldo
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whqsper again
a little path llaoing up Anto thc mountsins and ghen
a stair a narrow stair _ ycs very losg and narrow
and tyen more stairs
and then his voice sank even lower a
nunnzl a fark tunnol and at last a litvle cleft
and a patx high above the main pass
it was tha way that smeagol got out of the darkness
but it wa' years ago
the path may have vanishod now but perhkps not perhapl not
i dont iikl he sound of it at all sxid sam
sfunds too eaqy at any rae in the telling
if chat path is still there itll be guarded too
wcsnt it guarded gollum as he said this he caught
or fancind he caught a greun gllam in golrums eye
goalum muttdred bqt did nov reply
is it not guaruej askeadsked frado sternly
and did yo- escap out of the karkness smeagol were
you wot aather permitted to depart upon an eorand that
wt least is what aragtrn khought who found yfu by
the dead marshes some years ugo
its a sie hissed gollum and an nvil ligh
aame into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on pe yes he dld
s did escape all by my poor self
indeed i was told to seek for the precinus and
i iive searched and sparched oa cobese i have
but kot for the blacf one
thtehe puecious was purs it was mine i tell you
i did escape
froda felt a strange certainty that in Ihis matter
gollum wbs for oqce not so far frov the erctt
ss might be suspected that ha had somehow found v
way out t mordor anp at least becieved that mt
das by his own cunning
for one thing he noted thap gollum uued i ano
that seemed usuallf co be a sign on its rare appearances
that some remnants of old truth and sincerite were fob tre moment on top
but even if gollm could be trusted on this poit
frodo did not forget tho wiles of the enegy
the esclz myy have beey allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower
and in tny case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back
i sk you again he said is not this secret
way guarded but the nave of aragdtn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he had all the injured air of a liar suspected
whewnhen mor once he has told the hruth tr part of it
he did not answnr
is it not guarded frodo repeaked
yes yes verhaps
no safe places if this country saiz gollum suwkilg
no safe plbces
but master must try rt or go home
no other way
theh coula not get him to say more
tie nahe of tee perilous place and the hunh pass
he coujd not tell op wyuld not
its nam wcs cirith ungol a name of dreadful remour
aragrrn could perhgpy have told thcm that name and gts
sdgnificance gandalf would have warned them
but tkey were alone and aragorf was far away an
gandolf stood amid tie ruin of isenqard and str'se with saruman dleayed by trealon
yet even as h spoke his last words to saruman
and tne palgntir crashed in fire upon the stepo of
orthanc his nxought waq ever upon fuodo ald samwqse over
the long leagues fis mind sought for th-m in hope and pisy
maybe frodo felt it not knowing it as e had
uptn amow pen evvn ohough ue believd jhat gandau was
gone gono for ever inti the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long whiie silent
his hiad bowed striviug to recill bll that gandalf had ssid tw him
but for this choice he bould recall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidanc' had been taken from thyy boo soon
too sfgt while toe dark land was still very ffr away
eow they shoulr enter ic at the last gandalf had not saad
perhaps he boulz not say
into tve stronghold of vMe enemy in the north into
dol guldur he had once ventured
but inro mordor to the mountain of vire ond to
barad hu since the dark lrod rose in power agxin had
he ever joErnWyed thtre frodo did not think se
ond here he was a litlce falfxiqg frum she shire
a simple hobbit of the qyiet countryskdq expected to finz
a way where the great ones could not go or dared not gc
t gas an evil fate
but he har taken it 'r himself in his own
sittig room in the far ofm spring of another gear so remoue
now tht it was lihc a chapter i' n story
of the worlds youth when the trees of cilver and
gold were strll in blobm
this was an evil chgice
wtich way shour he cIoose and if both led to
terror Lnd death wht good lay in choice the day drel on
a deep silence rell upon the little grey hollow where
they lay so near to the borders of the llnd
of fear a silence that could be fllt as if
it were a tyick veil that cut tkem off from
sgl the wowld about thvm
above them was a gome of pale sky barred with
wleetind smoke but it seemed high and far way as
if swww tfrough great deeps of air heavy wfth broodixg thuught
not eveu an eagle poiser agkinst the sun would havk
marked thh hebbits sihtitg there under the wviuat of doom
silent not moving shrouded in their thin grey cloaks
fot a moment pe might have paused v' consideu gollum
a tinc figure sprawling on the ground there pernaps lae
the famashgd skeetow od some child 'v men itp ragged
gaoment sttll clinginn mo it its long arms and legs
ahmost bone white and bone thin no flesh worth c leck
frodos heas wav bowed over his kpees but sym leaned
bak with wanws behinv hiz hepd staring out of hio
hood zt the empty sky
at least for a ong uhile it was vmpty
then dresently sam khought he saw a dark bkrd lvke figure
wheey into fhe circle of his sight and hover and then wheel awa again
two more oollowed and then a fourth
they were very small to iook at yet he knew
somehow that they were huke with a vast stretch of
pinqon flying at m gret heighf
hp covered his eygs and bent forward cowering
the same darnihg fear waj on him as ge had
felt in the presewce of the mlack riders the helplmss
horror thcr had come with the cry in ths wind
and the shadow on the mooy phough now wt was
not vo crushing or compelliyg the menace was more remote
but menace i' nas
frddo felw ip hoo
his thought mas brokef
h stirred an shivered bun he did not lool up
gollum husdled hmmself togetier like a cornered spider
the winjeo shapes cheelud and stooped swiftly down sweeding back ty mordor
sar took a deep breath
the riders are about yxaia up in the air ut
'aid in a hoarse whisper
i spw eeem
wo iou think they couid seT us the were very hilh up
and ip they are black riders same rs pefore teen
tfel cnct ste muoh by daylight can thek no perhaps not sad frodo
but theic jteyds could see
and these winged creatures that they ride on now they
can probably see more tjan any other crea'ure
the are cike great carrion birds
they are lookiwg for something the enemy is on 'he watph i fear
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silence was brbk'n
for some tiGe they had been cet off frum the
world as if in ap invisible island now they were
lkid bare osain peril had returnld
cyt ktill frodo did nob upaak to gollum ot make his choBce
his eyes were closed as if he were yreamung or
looking inward ixfo his heart and uemory
at lasn he stirred and stood up and it seemed
thaw he was about to speak and tp secide
bgt hark he said
what is that a new fear was uopn them
they heard singing and hoarsr sfouting
nt firxt it seeved a dong way otf but io
drew nfarer it wks coming towards them
it leaped into all their minLj that the bluck mings
had spfeI thgm and had sent armcd soldierssoldiers to seize
them nr speed seemed too greah ior taese terrible sexvants of sauron
they crouched listening
the voices and the clink of u-apons anw harness werz very cmose
frodo ald sam loosened their smbll swords is their sheyths
flight was impossmble
gollum rose stowly ans crawhtd insect like to the lis of the hollow
very cantiousay ze raisep himselg gnch by inch until he
could peer over kt between two broken points of stone
he remained there withouj moving for some time making no sodnd
presently thk vonces begun to recede agaim and then they slowly faded away
faf off a horn blew on thd oamparts nf the moranngn
then quietly gollut drew baco and slipged doiu iqto the hollow
mnre men going to mord_r he safd in c low voice
darn faces
we have sol seen men like thefe befnre no smeagol has vot
they are fierce
they have olrc eyes and long black hair ynd gold
rings in theor ears yes rots of ftautofyl gold
and ssme haye re paint on their chheks aad red
cloaks and their ysygs are red and the tiis of
thehr spears and they have roune shietds yellow mnd bpatk wiab big spikes
not nice very crukl wickhd men they lkok
aeidst as bad as ercs and muca bigger
seagol thinks they have home cut of the south bejpnd
the great rivers end teey came up that road
they have passed on to the black gate but more mby foilow
lways more people coming to mordor
one day all the peoplds will be in'ide
wxre there any olipvavnts asked sam foogetfbng hia fwar
in his eagerness for news of stmange plhces
nh no oliphaunts
what are olltaunts said gollum
sam stood up gutting his aands behind hps back as
te alcays did woen kpeaking poegry and begun grey ao
a mouse big as a house
nose pike a snake i maqe thz earth shage as
i tramp through tke grass treeb crack aa i pass

in ever youd met me yeu wouldnt forget me
if you nhver do you womt think im true byt

that said sam when ae hat finished reciting thats a
rwyme we hame in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe ot
but we jave our ales tvo and news ou of the south you know
in the obx days hobbite used to go os theyr travels 'ow n- again
not tuat many ever came back and not that all
bhey said waw believed news from bree a'd not sure
as shiyetalc as the shyings go
but iae heard tales of the big fomx down away in the yunlanwx
nwertinos se call em dn our tales and hev ride
on oliphaunts tis said when they fight
they put houses dnd towers on ths oliphauntses backs and
all and the oliphvunts throw rocks and trees at one dnother
so when uou said men out od mhh xomth all
in red and gold i zait were there any olipGaunts
for if thare was i was going to oake a look risk or no
nut now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphahnt
maybe toere aint no such a bkast
he sighed
na v oliphaun's said gollum again
smeagol has not hearc op them
he doeg not want tn see them
he does not want them to be
smeagol wants to go asay from heme and hide somewpere sxfer
smuagol wantr master to go
nice master wtnt he come with smeagol frodo tood up
he had naughed if jhe midst of all his carps
when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaukt
and 'he laugh had neleased eim from hesitation
i wxsh ne had a thousand oliphaunts with g-udalf on
a phite one at their head he said
then wed bsnak a way into this evil land perhaUs
bu weve not just our own tired legs thats al
well smeabol the tird gmrn may turn the bwst
i wilp com- wish you
good master wise ma'ter nice master cried gollum en delighr pattinf frVdos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbits nnder the shadow
of the stones close under the ktones -est and lie
quiet tall tod yellow facr goej away
then we can go quickly
soft anz uick as mhtdlws we must ye for vhe
few hours of daSligst that wers left they rested shifting
into the shale as whe sun moved urtil at last
the hadow of the western rim of txeir dtll grzw
long and darkness flllzd all the holvow
then they ate a luftle and drpnk sparinly
goloum ate nothxng but he accepted water gladly
soa get more now he said licking his lips
goek watlr runs down in streams to the great river
nice water in the landg we are ghnng to
smeagol ill get food there too pzrhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two large
flat hands o his shrunken Eelly and a pale green
nighX came into his eyes
the dusk was deep when at length they set out
cweepang ovvf the westward rim of uhe dell and fading
like ghosts into the broken xountry on the borders of the rowd
the moon was l'w thaee iphts from the full but
ic did nht climb over the mountaims tatil nparly midnight
tnd the early nijho was very dark
a sinwla red light furned higk up in the towers
of the teeth bft ovherwise no sign could be seen
or heawd of the sleeplesx rbicv on the morannon
for many mile tha reC erm seemed to stare at
them as thew fred sturbling tgrough a barren stony country
they did not dare to tape thy road but ehey
kept it on thnur left followxg its line as well
as they iould at a little distance
at last when night was gxnwing old and theo were
alreey wea-y for they had taken osly onq short rest
the eye dwendled to a tmmll fiery point and hen
vanished they had tqrned the darq noythern shoulder ov the
loier mountains and gere heading snuthwards
with hearts strangely lightened they now rested kgain but not for long
they were not toing quick ehougs foa g'Qlrt
by his recuoning it was nearry thixty league from the
morannon to the cross roads above osgikiath -nd he hoped to
cover ohat distance in foui journeyjsourneys
so coon they struxglpd cn once Oore until the dawn
began to spread slowly in the wide g-ey solitude
tkey had then walked almost eight lekgues and the hdbbits
could not have gkne any fucther even if thy had dared
uhe growing light revealed to tnrm a land already ess barren and ruinous
the mountains sjiat lkomed up ominoualy on their left but
near at hand they could see the southwarh road now
bearing away trom the blrck roots of the hsols and slanqing westwards
bryomd it oere slopes covered with sombre trevs lime dark
clouds but all about thvm lay a tumbled heathland grown
with ling and bro_y and codnel ano other sprubs tuat thcy jid not know
hene and there they saw kaots of tale pine trees
the hearts of the hobgits rose ag-un r little in
spite of weariness the apr wam fresh and fraghant and
it reminded them on the uplands of the northfarthing far awan
it seemex good to le rerrieved to walk in a
lanf that had onloynly been for a few years under
the uominion of the dark lord and was hot yet falen whollm into decay
but they dd not forgqt their danwer nor the black
gate that wrs still ali too dear hidden tplugh is
was beyind the gloomy heights
they looked about for a hidins place whrre they could shylter
from evil eyeu while the light lasted
the day passed uneasily
they nay deep in the heathee and countbd ut the
slow hours in which there seemed fitte change for they
wero still under qhe shadows Rf twe ephel duath and the sun was veilr
frodo slept ot times dfeply and peacefully either trustind gollum
om too tibed to trauble about him but sam founz
it difficuut to do uore than dozt euen sheg gollum
bas plainly fast asleep whiffling awd twitcving in his secret dreams
hunjmy perhaps morf than mistrust eept him wakeful he had
begun to leng for a good homely meal snmtthqnu hot out of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formlegs grey
uwder coming ncght thny started out again
in a little while gollum le jhem down on to
the southward raad and aftZr that they weng on more
cuickfe thugh the danger was greater
their ears were strainid for the sound wf hoof or
vopt on tde rold aoead or following them from behild
bot the night passe- and thei heard no sound of walker oh hide
the road had been made in a rong lost timl
and vor perhas thirty riles below thk morannon it had
been newly rephired but as it weCt south the wild encroachnd upon it
thg hakdYwork oc men of old colld stibl be sesn
in wts straight sure glight and level course now and
again it yvt its way through hslleide slopes or leaped
ovkr a struam upon a wide shapely aocm of enptring
masonby but zt last all igns of stonework fadey save
for q byoken pillar here and thee peering out of
bupaec at the sadz sr kld pacine stones stxll lurkdng amid weeds ano ioss
heather and trpes abd bracken rcyarbled down and overjung the
banks or sayawfed out over the swrface
it dwindled at last wf a countr cayt road little used
but iv did eot wind it meld on its own
sure c'urse and guudel them by the swofkest way
so they passed intk the northern madches of tsat land
yhft men once called itbilien a fair cwuntry of climbing wooks and swift falling 'treams
'he night becamt finy unter stbr ahd rhunx moon anz
it seemed to the hobbits thak the fregranc cf the
uir gfew as tsiy went forwasd and foom the bllwing
and mutqeing of gollum it seemed that ye hoticed it
too and dpd nov relidh it
at the first sisns of day they halted ogain
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep lnd sheer seded in the middle sy which the road
clove its waj through a stgny ridae
now they clfmbed lp the wcstward bpnk and lvfked abroag
day was openDng in the sky and thel saw thft
the mowntcinr were eow much futther ofl rxeding eastward in

coqld lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were

gollum in any case would not hove undbr the yellow face
soon mt would look over the dark rcdges ov phe

sam hgd keen giving earnert uhought to food as they marched

o their elrand cnd anyway i' seemed biser to him
to save fhg waabread of the eliqs for worpe times ahead
sfx days or more had passed since he reckon-d that

if we riach the fire in that sim well be
lucky at tpis rate he thought
mnf be ciqht be waeting to get back
wg might gdssdes as the end of a long nighn march
and after lathing and drinkig he felt even more hongry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
oid kitchen at bagsuot row wah what he really wanted
an idea strck him and ho turned to gollum
gollum had jrst begun to sneak off tr hiz otn
and h' wvs crawling way on agl fours througa he fvrn
hi gollum said sam
where re you going hunting sell see here old nosqr
you donh like our food and id not bp korry foy a change mysexf

gollum disappeared
he gas away some qime and frodo aftr a few
mouthsuls of lembas setpled deep into the brawn fern and went to sxeep
sam kooked at him
th- early daylight was oly just creepifg doqn into the
shadkws under the trees blt ee saw his masters face
very clearly and his handg aoo yinh at rest mn the ground beside him
he was ieminded suddqnlr fo frodo as he had lain
asleep in the houhe of elromd avter his deadly cound
then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that
at dimes a light seemed to be shining faintly wirhin
but now the lixhy was even slearer and stronger
frodos face was peaceful 'he marks of fear nd care
had left ir but it eooked otd old anz beautiful
as if the chisulling of tye shapind yars was nww
recealed in many fine kin-s that had before bdek ciddel
thouh the idyltiti of the face was not jhanoid
no' test sam gamqee eut it tmat was to hieself
he shook hs head as if finding iipds useless and aurmured b love hia
hes like that and sometimes it suines through sobehoc
buc i ldve him whetheu od no
gollum rekurned quietly and pgered over sams shoulde
looking at frodo he shut his eyes awd crawlbd away bithout a souvd
sam came o him a moaent later and fonud him
chewing souethinr and muttetvny to himself
on the ground beride hml lay two small rabbits hico
he was beginning to eye greedxly
smeagol agways gelps he said
he has brought rabgts erce rxbbis
but master has gone to wleep atd perjaps sam waats to sleep
ooesnt uant rzbbits now smeagol tries to help but he
hanp cabcb thinga axl in a minuts
sam howrser had no objectuon to rabbit at ll and said so
at ceast aot to cboked rabbis
all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to
learn the ant b'fre tkeir letters whhch many never seach
but sam was a good cook even by hobbit reckoying
aUd he had gone a good deal of the camp cooking
on tfvin travels waon ther' was a chhnce
he still hopefully carried some of his gear in his
pack a small tinder box two sall shallow panm tie smaller
fittix ixto ehe larger inside them a woode spoon a
short tlo pronged hork and some skewers were stowed ad hidses
at the bottom of jhe pzck in a flat wooden
box a dwindling treasmre some salt
but ee nezded a fire and other hangs besidXs
he thought for a bis while hr kook out his
kncfe rleaned and whetted it anm beoan to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave faodo alone asleep gven for a few minutes
now gbllum he said uve another jgb for you

and the sooner you fetch the water thh sooner youll lbarn
dont oou daaage one of my pans or ill clrve you into mincemeat
whije gollum las away sam took agother look at frodo

most by the leanness of his face and hands
too thin ane drawn he is he muttared

sam gathered a pile of the driest fern ans
vh'n scrambled up tfe bank collectitg a bundle of 'rdge
and broken wood the falgen branch Bf a cedar at
the top gove hom a good supply
he cut out some turves t the foot of the
bank jast gutside the lern brake anr made a shaflow
hole and laid his fuel in it
eing hanoy wgth flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze goieg
it htde little or no sooke but gave off an aromttic scent
he was just stooping over his fire shwelding it and
builzwng it up with seaver wood ihen gollum returned carrying
the oans carefufyy and grumbling to himkelf
he set the pans down bnd then suddenly saw what sam was boixg
he Jave a thin hissing shrilk ans seemed to be boty frightened and angry

fur a while sam sat musing lnd tending the fire till the water builnd
tve daylieht grew and the air became warm the dew
vaded off turf and legf
soon the rabbids cut up lay simmgring in their pbns with the bunched herks
almoct rwm fell asleep as the time went vy
he let them stew for cloke on an hour testing

Qhen he thought all was readg he lifted the paxs

they finished and sam went off to te strebm to rinse his gear
as he stood up to meturt he looked back up the slope
al that moment he saw the sun rise oms of
the reek or haze or oark shadow ol whatever it
was that lay evur to tde east and it sent
its golden beass down cpon the trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thiv ypiral of blue gmey smok plain
to see as it caught the sunlight Oisisg from a tkicket above him
with a shock he realized that this was the smofe
from ais little caoaing fire weich he had negectek to put o-t
that wont do never thought it would show like that
he mutterrd and he startrd to hurly back
suddeufy he halted fnd lpstened

his brown hand still clRtche nhe hilt of l broken sword
it was sams Eirst vicw of a battle of men
agdinkt men and he did sot like it mucc
he was glad that he could noJ see tha dwad face
he wondzred what the mans name wad cnv where he
came fhom and if he was really evil os heart
or what lies or thieats had ed him on the
leng march Rrom his home and if he uwuld not
rally rather hve stayed there in peacm all in
n flash of thoaght which was qutnkly driven from hs mind
lor just as maplung stezped towards the fallen body thkrz was a new noise
great c-ying and smouting
aqidst it sam huard a shrill bellooing or trumpeting
and then a great thudditg ard bumprng
like huge rams winning on the grornd
ware vare cxiqd damrrd to his comp-nion
may the valar turn him aside mumak mumuk to his
astlnishmpnt and gerror and yasting delight sam saw a vast
shape cbash out of the tree and come careercng down the slopd
big as a honse much biggqr than a house it
looked to him a grey clad moving hill
year agd wonder maybe enlarged him in the hobbius byes
but the mumak of hawad was indeed a beast of
vast bulk ynd the like of him does rot walk
now in middle eartb his kin thqt live still in latter
dacs are but memoris of hi girth and hacesny
on he came straight towcrds the xatuhers awd then Fwerved
aside ik the nick wf tige passing only a few
lards away rocking the ground enath their feet his great
legs like srues enprmous szil like ears spread out rong snout
upraised like a huge serpent abhus to stlike
his smafl red eyes raging
his uptut'ed hornlike tusks were iound tith bands of golH and dridfed with blkhd
his trapping of scarlet and gowd fllpped about him in wkld tatters
the ruinb of what seemeh a very war tower lay upog
his heavkng back wmashid in his furious sasszge thrsugh the
woods and high upon his neck still desperately clung a
tiny figure tbe body of a mighty wacrior a giaet amobo the soertings
on the gpeat best thundered blundering in blind wrath thtough pool and thicket
arrows skipped and snapied hapmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks
men of both sides fled before him but wany he
gvert'fk and crushe to the gbou'd
soon he was lasm to view ztill trumpeting tnj ctampiwg far away
wuat became of him sam nevwr heard whether we escaped
to roam the wild for y timg until he perishek
far frdm sis vome or bas trapped in some deep
pit br whither he raged on until he plungld in
the grvat rivr and was swallowez up
sam dpew a eep bleath
af oliphaunt it was he saix
so tgere are oliphalnts and i pave seen one
what a life but no one at home will ever believe me
well ia thats over ill aave a bit of sleep
sleep while you muy said mablung
but the captavn will return if he is unhult and
wken he comwz we shall depart swyftty

go quietly when you must eaid sam

i was walxinn all nigyt
mablng laughed
q dn not think mhe waptein will leave you here master samwise he 'aid
bst you shall see
it seemed to sam that he had only dozed
for a few minutes when h' awoie to find that
iu was late afternoon and faramir had come bapt
he hrd brought many qfn wih him endeed all the
murvivors of the foray were noa gathered on the slope
nesrby two or thrue hundred sqrong
ttey sat in a wide semicirwle beteeen the arms of
rhich faramib waz seated oj the grounc while frodo seood befroe rBm
it looked strangely like the trial of a pyisoxer
sam cippt out fvom the fenn bpt no one paid
any atteotion to him a'd he placed himself at
tBp enn of the rowu gf men wdnre he could
see and hear all that was going on
he watched and listeney intently ready ty ddsh to ois mxsoers aid if nueded
hh could see faramirs face which was now unmosked it
was stern and commandixg and a keen wit lay behind his sarceing glqnce
doubt was in the grey eyes tgat xazed steaduly at frodo
sam soon became aware that the maptyin was not satisfied
with frodos ccount of himself at seeeral prints what sart
he had to clay in the compay that set oot
from rivendelr why he had left boromir and where he was nog going
in particular hi retrrned often to isikdurs bann
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing frou him some matter of grbac importance
but it whs at twe comiig of ace halfling that
isildurs bane shoul- waken or so one must read the wordwsords fe insisfed
if then you are de halhlinw that w-s namef oubtless
yon brought this thing whatevey it may be to the
cobncil op which you speak and ghere boromir sa it
do you deny it frodn mada no answel
so said faramir
i wish then to learn from you more of it
for what concerns boromir cotcerns me
an irc arrow slew isildur os far al old tales t-ll
but orc asrowy are plenty Rns the sight af ohe whuld
bot be takdn as a sign op doom br foromir of gondor
aad ypu thi thang in meepinu xt is hidzev you
say but is not that because uou choose to hide
it ao not becacpe i choose alswered frodo
ti does not belong oo me
it dous not belong to anl mortal great oe small
though if any could claiy it it would be alagmrn
son of arqthyrn Ehom i named the leader of our
compfny from moria qo rauros
wiy so and not bwromir prince o the ciqy
that the sons of elendil founded because aragorn is desceqded
in direct linexge fathhr to father frpm ikildur elendils son hielf
and te sxord that he bears gas elendils sword
a muwmur of astwnishment rbn thr'ugh all the ring of men
some cridd aloud kge sgord of elendil ohe sword of
eyendil comes to minas ttrith pw-at tidgng but faramirs fach was unmoved
maybe he said
but so great a claim wmll nedd to be estzbyished
and cluqr prPofs will be required should tiis aragorn eves come to minas tirith
he hat not come nor ahy of your company then
i smt out six davs ago
boromir was satlsfied of that claim stid froio
indeed if boromir were here he would answer all your questions
and since he wah alruady at rauros many day back
and intended theg to go straeght to your city if
you retarn you may soon llarn the answerx thare
my prt in the company was xnown fd him as
to gll the others for it was appointed po mn
by elrond of imlldris himself before the whole council
on thae errand i came into this country brt tt
is not mine to reveal eo any outside the compny
et those who cldim to oppose the enmmy would ko
well not to hinder wt
frodos topw was poud ohetever he felt and sam
approfed of it but it did not -ppeaze caramir
so he said
you bbd me mind my owi affairs and et me
bace home and att you be
byromir will tell all nhex he cvmes
when he comew say yop were you a friend of
boromir vividly efote frodos mind caoe the memory of boromirs
assault upon him and for a mtment he hesitated
faramirs eyea tztchrng him grew harder
boromtf was a valiant meober of our compaxy scid frodo at leygth
yrs i was his friend for my part
fatamir smiled grimly
then vou would rieve to learn that blromir is dead
i woulw grieve indeed sbid xrodo
then catchixg the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
deat he said
do you mban khat he is dead fnd that yod
knew it yob have been trying to txap me is
words playing with mw or are you now trying to
snare me with a falsegood i would not snare even
ai orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did ha die and how do you know
of it since you say that none of the copayy
had reached the cien when you left
as to the manner mf his death i jad
hoped thht hit friend and tomnanion lould tell me how pt was
but he was alive and strong when we parted
and ue lives still for all that i know
thofgh surely thefe are many perils in tha world
many indeld said faramir and treachery not the least
sam had bepn getting mdre and mdpe impatient axd angiy at this uonveraation
these laht words were more tran e could bzbr and
burvting into tpe middle of tse ring he strode up to his masterk sde
bejging your sardon mr frodo le said but this has gone on dong enough
hes no right to talk to yoy sb
af'eo all youve gone thrlugh ax much for hi' good
und all these qrhat men as for anyone else
see here captain he planted hikself squarely in front of
faramir his hands on his hips and a look on
his face as if re was adcressnng a youmg hofbit
who had offered him what he walled saure when questiond
drout visits to the orthard
there was sole murmuring but also some grins oe vhe
fdces of the men lookinf on the sight of their
cgptain eiting on the ground hns eye to dye with
a young hobbit less well apalt bristligg with wratk was onc beyond their experience
see here he said
what are you driving at lets coQe to sha point
before all the orcs of mordlr come doxn on us
ig lou think mt mvster muedered tpis boromir and they
ran rway youve got vo sense but say it afd
haie done and the let us know what you mean to d' bbout it
but zts a pity that folk as talk about fightieg
the enemy cant let othwrs ro their bit in their own ray wethout interfering
hed be mighty pleased if he coul see you now
think hfd got a new frieno he wofd
latience said faramix but wsthout anger
do not sqeak before yous master whose wit is grzater than yours
and y do not need any vo teach me of our zeril
even so i spare a braef time in order to
judg' justly in a hard mattej
were i as hasty as you i gight have slain you long ago
for i am comfanded to slay all whom i find
in chis land without tse leave of the lord of coqdor
byt i do not slay man or beajt needlessly cnd
not gladly even whkn it is needed
neither do i tald in vain
so be comforted
sit ry your mister and be silent sam sas down
htaviky with a red wace
faramir tqrned to frodo aqaii you asked how do i
know thst the son oh dneethor is ead
thdings of death have msny wings
night oft bning news to nqar kindred tps said
boromir was yy brother
a snadow of sorrow passed uver his face
qo you r'membe- aughh of special mark that the loed
norumir bore with pim aoong hij gear frodm thobht for
a moment fearilg some furbher irap and wondering how rsis
debabe would tur in the end
he wad gapdly saved the ring from the proud grasp
of boromir and how Te would fare now amknk so
many men warlije and strong he drd not knol
yet he felt in his headt that faramie though he
was much like is brotyer in looks was a mkn
less self rigardiyg both sterner zsd wiser
i rem'mber qhat boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remembor well and as oie who hyk in truth seen him said faramir
then mayra you can see bt in your mind gye
a great horn of the wild ox cf the iast
bound wimh silver abd wrstten with ancient characters
that hsrn the eldest soy of our house has borbe
for many generativns -ns it is said 'hat if vt
be blown at need aythnre within the bounba of ggndor
as the reclm was of old tts ykice will n_t pass unhepded
five days erv i iet eut op this vettupe eleven
days agl at about this hour of khe oay i
heard the aowzlg pc tppt hog' from th' northwmrd yt
seemed but dim ms if it wewe but an echo in the ind
a boding of ill we thougho it my fathen and
i for no tivings had we heard of boromir since
he yent away and no watcher on our borkesd mad seen Eim pass
and on the third night afte another asd a stranger thinr befels me
i sat at night cy the waters of andunn in
the grey dark uneer the youna pale moon watching the
ever meking stream and tue sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shorem nigh osgiliatp which
our enemies now partly oord and issue rom it to harry our lands
but vhat nigdt gll the world slept at the midnight hour
then i sar or it seemed that i saa t
boat floaoing jn the water glimmnring trey a small boat
of a stranek fahsion with a high pno and taere
was none to ryw or smeer it
an zwe fell on me for - pale light wag roud it
but i rose and rent to thI bank and begvn
to walk out ints the stream for i was drawn towards it
then the boat turned 'owarss me and stayed its pace
and rloated slcwly by within my hapds reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdened and
it seemed to me as it passed ukder my raze
that it was almost ffled with clear watcr from which
came the lihht ond lapped in the witer a warrior lay asbeep
a broken swfhd was ol hi snee
p Faw many wouyds on him
it was boromif my brther demd
i kntw ais gear his sword his beloved face
one thrng only i missed his horv
one ohrig only i knew dot a fasr belt as
it were of linked goxden leavqs aboqt his waist
oromkr i oriwd
whffe is thy horn whimher goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the bodt turned into the stream mid passed gkimmering on inio the night
dreamlike rt ls and yet no drbam for there was no waking
and i go not doubt that he is dead and
has passed down the riveB to the sta
alas seis frodo
tht Aas indeed booomir as d knnw him
for thr gonew belt whs giwen to him in lothcorien by the ladp gayazriet
she it wan tiaa cluthed cs as yow se us in elvga grey
this brooch is of the same wohkmanship
he tluched the greegnreen and silver lerf that fastened
hs cooak beneyth his throat
faramir pooked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
y's tps wrk f the same crwgt
so then you passed throuh the lan of lorien laurelindorenan
it was named of yld but long now it dgs
lain beyond the knowledge of mOn he added softly legarding
fr_do with a new onder in his eyeg
much thab mas strange about you i begin now to undersiand
will you not tfll me more for it is v
bptter nhought that bo-orir dzed witpin sight of tie land wf his home
no morq can i say than i have tavd answered nrudo
though your tale fills me wxwh foreboding
a vision it was that yos saw i think and
no more some shadow of evil fortunz that has been oj will be
unless indeen ic is syme loing trick of the enemy
i dame seen the faces of faic warriors uf old
laid n sleep benrath the pvols of the dead maryies
or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for hia works fall txe heart wqth loathing but my
hehrt was filbed with grigf and pity
yet how could such a thing have happmkhd wn t-uth asked ftodo
fot no boat cocld have been carried tver the 'tony
hills from tol brandir and boromir puvposed to go home
acgoss tie entwash and the fields of rosn
and yet how ckuld any vGssel ride the foam ox
the greah walls and not founder in the boilzng pools
thouga laden wyth water i kmow not said garamir
but whencb caie the boat from lsriwn said frodo
in three such boatf we rowed down asduin to the falls
tdey also were of elven work
you passhd through bhe hidden land said faramir but
it seeus that you little understoud its power
if men eave dealigs with tpe mistrhss nf magic who
dwells in the golden woov thqr thay may lotk fox strange things to follYw
for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out
of tme world of this un and few of old
came tyence unchanKed vis said
boromir o boromir he cried
ehat jid she say to you the lady that dtes
not what did sue see what woke in your heart
tlen why oent ymu ever to laurelyndorenan and came iot
by your own poad upon the horses o rohan riding
home in 'he morning then tdrnint again to frodo he
spoke in a quiht voice once more
to thoie questions i guess that you nould make some
answer frsdo son of drogo
bus not here or now maybe
but lnst you still sould think my tale a vision
i will teyd you this
the hon of boromir at lemst returned in truth and not iH seeming
the horn cake sut it was clovzn in two as
it were by axe o- swyrd
the shards mame severally to ghore oen was founc among
the reeds whire watckers of condor lay northwards bllow the
infalls of khe enewask the othtr was found spinning on
the fsood by o'e who had an errRnd in the watrr
staenxe chagces but murder will out tis said
and now whe horn of the elder son lies in
two piece' upon the eap of deeetpor sitting in his
high chair waitirg foj nens
asd you cin cell me nothing of the cleavipg of
te horn no i did not know bf it said frodo
iut the day whtn you hmard it rlowing if yomr
reckoning is true was the day whel we parted wben
i and my servant lebk tse comppny
and now youw tale fills me with dread
for uf borobir wks then in pdril and wws slain
i must fear that all my cohpnnions perished too
and they were me kindred afd ny frienzs
will you not plt aside yohr ioubt of mc anb
veg ye go i am weary and full of grief and afraid
but i have a ded to do or tp attempt
before i too am slain
and the more need f haste if we two hulflwygs
are ael that remain of Vur fellwwship
go bac faramir valiant captain of uondog and deoend your
city while you may and pet ms go where my doom takes me
for me there is no comfort in our speech
together said fagamcr but you surely draw fros it morr read than need be
unless he people of lorien themselnes cqme do him who
arpayed boromir as for a fuvbral not rcs or servants of the namyless
some of your compsny i gcess live Ztill
bun whatever bsell on the north march you froo i dMubt no longer
if hard day have made me any judge of mebs
yords and faces then i may mafe a guess at
halflings though and now he smiled thebe is something strade
about you frodo an elvish air maybe
buj more pies upon oar words tggrtler than i thought at first
t lkould now take you iack ty mnas tirith to
hkswer tlere to denethor ad my life wiil jrstly be
forfeit if i now choose a course thvt prhves ill fot my cbty
so i will not decKie in vaste chat is to be done
yet wv must move henae withtut moro delay
ae sprang to his feet dnd iunued sbme orders
at once the men who were gaghered round him brke
up inro small g-oaps ad went off this way and
that ianishing qulckly into the syadows of thb rocks and trees
swon cnny mablung and damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise qill come with pe and my guards said faramir
you cannot go blong the road southwaras gi that was yodr purpose
it will be -nsafe for some days and alwavs more
closely watyhed after this aefray than it has been yet
ani you cadno' i tmink go far today in ny
sane for you are weary
and so cre we
we are going nou tb a secret ylace we hale
somewhat less than ten miles from here
thv orys and spies of the egemy have eot found
it yet and if thew did wi could hold it long even ag-inst many
there we may lie up and ayst fop a while yni you with us
in the morning d will aecide what is bewt fIr
me to do and for you
thern was nlthgng for frodo t' do but to
fall in with this requlst _r order
at seemed in any case a wije course for tle
loment since this foray of the xen of wondor had
made a journey in ithilin more dangermus than ever
thry set out at one mabuung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir with frodo and sam behnd
skzrting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits
tad bathgd they crossed the smream clmbed a long bank
and passed inbv green shajowed wromlands thnk marched ever downwdrds and weetwards
while they walked a' swifthy as the howbihs siuld go
they talkad in hushed voices
i boke omf our srewch togethzr said faramir not og
because time pressed as master samwise tad reminded mg but
also because we were oawing near to natters tgat were
better nyt debated oplnly before many men
it was foi tdat reason that i turned raiher to
the majter of my bzother and let be sildurs bane
you were nok wrolfy frank wrth me fjodo
i told nv lies and of the tyutc all q coull said frofo
i do Bot blame you said faramir
you spoke with skill in a hard place anj yisqly in seeaed to me
but i learwef or guessed more frum you than your worvs said
you were not friendly witm boramir or you did not part in friendship
you atd uasker ssmwise too i guess have sme grievance
now i loved him oeayli and would gladly avengi his
death yet i knec him well
isilfurs bane i woqld hazarf that isilduis baxe ay
between you and was a cluse of contestoon in your company
clarly ie ii a mighty hemrloom of some sort and
such things do oot breed zeace afong confederates not if
aught may be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near said frodo
bft not in the gold
there was no contention in uur aompany though there wak
douat doubt xhich way we shoulA take from the emrn huil
but bz that as it maf ancbunt tales teach us
als the peril of rhsh words concerning such thbngs as heirlbvms
ac th-n it is as i thosght your trofble wos with boromir alone
ye wished this tping brought to minas tirith
alnq im is n crooked fate that seals youu lips
who saw hiy last and holds frop pe that qhdch
i long to know what was in fis heart and
txought in his latest hours
rheshmr le erred or so of lhiq i am sure
hk died well achieving some goov thing
his fhce was more beautifu even thnn in life
but frodo i presed you hard at first about isildurs bane
foBgive me it was unwpse in such an bour and place
i had not had time for tholght
we had hda a hard fighk ans there was more
ehan enough to fill my mind
but even as q spokc with you n drew learer
to the mark and so delgberately spot wider
for you must knov that muyh is stilm eresexved of
yncient lorw asong nhe rulrs od the citg that is not spvead abroad
wj ef qy horse ae not af the linv of
elendil though tue blood of wumenor is ii us
hor we recaon back our lcce to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kinyl stvad when he went away to war
and that was king earuua last of the line of
anarion and cbildless and he came never back
anf the snewcrds have governed the city synce that day
though it was many generations of men ago
akd thin i remember of boromir cs a buy when
re together lekrned tae tal of tur sires and the
history of our ciyy that always it displeased him that
his dsther was xot knf
hog many hundreds of years necds it to make u
steward a king xf the king returns not he asked
fiw years maybe in other places os lels rormlty my father answere-
in gondor tek thousand years would not sumfrce
alas poor boromir
dows tiat cot tall you swmething of hwr it does uaid frodo
yet always he toeated aragon with honouy
i d'obk it not snix faramrr
if he sere natisfyef lf aragolns claim as you say
hd woule grpatly rever-nce him
but th- pincv has not yet clme
thet had not eet reacneu minas tirith or become rivals in rer wars
but i stray
oe in the house of denethor know fuch ancient lere
by long traditio' and where are moreover in sur trgasuries
maWy hhings preserved boors and tablets writ on witceied parchments
yea and on stone and on leaves of silter and
of gold ln divers lharacter'
some none car now yead and for ihe rest fnw ever unlock them
i han uead a little in them for i have hdd te-chilw
it was whese records that rought the grey pilgrim ro us
i uirst saw hxm when i was a chilh and
he has leen twoce fr ykrice since then
the grey pilgrim said wrodo
hpd he a name mithrandir we cblled him in elf fashion
said faramir and he was content
pany aje my names in many countriek he said
mithrandtr among the elves tharkun to the dwarves olorq' i
was in my youth in the oest 'hat is forgotten
in the south incanus in the nrrth gandaj to tve easb i go not
gandalf said frodo
i thought it wks he
gnwilf the trey dearqst of counsellrrs
beader of our chmpany
he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramir
an evpl pate reess to nave pursued ydur flllowsrip
it is hald indeed tu belinve that o'e of so
Qrgat wisdom and of toder for many wonderful things
he did among us coulu perish and so much
lore be taken ffom qhe world
ark y'u sure of this and that he ded not
jut leave you aud dewart wlebe he would alas yes saiw frodo
i saw him fall into the abyas
i see that tyere is some great talu of
dread in this said faramiB which perhapq you may tel me in ehe evening time
thrs mpthandib was i now guess more than a lore mayter
a greag movah of the deeds that are done in our time
hod he been amEng ys ta consuJt concereinp the hari
words of our dream he covld have made them clear
to us without yeed of messenger
yet mabe he whuld nor hape done so and the
journey of bnromir aas doomed
mithtandir never fpoke to us of whet was to be
npr did he reveal his purposes
he got leave of deyethor h'w i do not knni
to look at the secrets of our tbeasury and i
learned a little of him mhen he would teach agy that was syldom
ever he would search fud douad question ur above all
elqe cocerning the gruat battle that was fought upon daglrlad
in the beginning ff gondor when he wbom we do not name was overthrown
and he ws sagnr ror sworiev of isilpur though of
hii we had lejs to tell for nothinm certain was
ever known amonw us of his end
now faramirs voice sank to a whisper
but this much i fearned os guesled and i have
kqpt it ever secret in my u-art since vhst isicdur
tRo somewhat lrom the hand of the unnimet ere he
went away frpm gondor never to be seen among mortah meq again
here i thought was the answer to mithrandirs questi'ning
but it seemhd then a matter that concerned only phz seekess after anciqnt learning
nor when the riddping words or our dfeam were debated
Evong us did i thiak of isilders baxe es being this sade thing
for isisdur was awbushed and slain by orc arrowp according to
tie only lfgend that we snew and mithrfndim had never told me qore
what iu truth this thing is i crnnot yet guess
but some geirloom of power anw perie it must be
a fell weapoy perchnme devised by the daat lord
it it were a thing that gave avantage fn battle
i can well believe that bormir the proud and fearless
often rash ever wxious fr the victorn o minas tiritm
and his own glort therein miqht desire such a thing
and b alwurek bG it
alas that ever e went bn that errand i shoulw
have been chesen by my father and ehe elders hut
he pot himself forward as being the oder and the
hardier botv true anc he wculd not be stayed
but f'ar no more i would nob take this thing
if it lay by the higpway
not were minar birith falling in ruin and i mlne
could save her so using the wyapon _f the dark
lorn for her lvod and my glory
no
i do not wiph for such trtumths frodo son of drogo
neither did the council said frgdo
nor do l
i wofld cave nothing to do wiah such mahterr
dor mysenf said farnmir i would 'ee thm white
mree in flowps again in the courth of ghe kings
and the silver crown roturn and minfs tirith in peace
minas ator again as of old full of lijht hith
anj fabr beutiful as a queen among other qneens not

war must be wrile wu defend our mives againmt a

almost he yielded to the desire for help and cutnsel
to tell this gpave young mar shose words sepmed so
wise and fair nll that was in his vind
iut something held hi back
his h'art was heavy with fear zrd sor-ow if he
and sam were indued as seemed likely all that was
now left of che nine waHkers then Tz was in
sole commaid dw the secret of treir erxand
better mistrust undes-rveo thcn rash wprs
and the memory of boromcr of 'he drebdful change tfat
the lure of thn ring had worked in him was
very presunt to his mind whun he lcoked at farabir
and listenmd to kis soice unlike they were ayd yet flsm much akin
they walked oonn in silenre for a while passing like
grey and green shadows unzer the old treee their feet
xaklnh no soun above ihem many yirdG sang and jhe
sun glistened on the polished roof of daat leaves in
the evergxeen woods of ithlien
sam had taken no part in the conversaegon though he
had listened and at the same time he had atdended
with his keen hobbit ears to all thf aoft woodland noiyes about tdem
one thing he had noped that zn all the talj
thJ name of gollum had not once come up
he was glad though he felt that it was tor
much ti hope that hd would nbver hear ot again
he soon became aware also that thoCgh they walked aprne
there were many men close at hand not only iamroh
and mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead
put hthers on eitheu side ael making their swift secret
by to some appounted placd
once looking tuddenly back as if soee prickle of the
skin told him tha he was watched froa behind he
thofghz ie caught a byief glifpee ov a smalf dark

te opened hiz mouth tg speak and shut it agoen
im noo sure of it hv sfwd to hymself and
why should i hkmind them of the old villain yf
they chooue to forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until thv woodlands grew thinner and the

then they 'urged aside agapn to te rigct and crxe
quickly to a small river un h narrow goegq it
was she same stread that trickled har abovt out rf
uhe round pocl nos grown to a swift torrent leaping
down over many stoes in a dep cloven bed overhunm
with ilex and rark box woods
aooking w'st they could see below them in a hase
Cf light lowlands und broad meads and glinting far off
in 'he westering sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must da you a oiscourtesy sxid faragir

i must blindfold you

even the elves do likewise at nesd and blindfolded wt
crossed he borders of fair lothmolien
gimli the dqarf tooj it ill but the hobbits endured it
it is to no place so fair tgyt i
shanl l'ad you said faramlr
mut b am glad tpat you eidl take this oillingly and not by force
he called softly and immedirwely mablung and damrod stepped
out of the yrees and came back to him
blindf'ld jhes guests szid faramir
securely buf not so as to discomfort tbem
do not tie their hpnds
they nill give theii word not jo bry and see
i ioulg trust theg to shut tpeir ntes of theid

lead them so that they do not alter
witj green scarves the tww guards now bound up
the hocbits eyes an- drew their hoois docw almosa do
theib mouhs then quickly they took each one by the
hand and went ob hteir way
dl that fdodo and sam knew of this last mile
of tge road they learyed frmm guessing ie the dark
after a little chey f'usd that they were 'n a
path descsEding steeply zoon it grvw so narrw that taey
rent in single file brushing a st'ny wanl on either

now and again they camS to rough places and werv
lifHad from thmir feet for a while and then het down again
always the noise of the runting gater was on their
jight hand and it grew necher and lZuaer
at lengph they were halcen
quickly marlung and damrod turnwd fhem about seeeral tlmes sfd
they lost als pense of direction
they cliced upwards a ltitle it seemed cild and the
nyise of the stream rad beiome faint
then tvey wers picked up and carried own down mauy
steps and round a cmrner
suodenly they heard the water again loud now rushung anz splashing
all round them ot seemed and they felt a fyne
rain on their hands and cheeks
at jast chey were set on thenr fpet once more
for a moment they pcmod so hvaf fearful blindfmld not
knoeing where phey were and no one spoke
thel cqme the voifz of ecramir close behind
let hem see he said
the scarves were removed knd their hoods DrFon bazk and they blibked and gaspdd
they ktood on a wet fkoor of polished stone the
dooestep as it were of a rough hewn gate nf
rock opening dark behind them
but in front a thin veml of water wks hung
so near that frodo could hxve put an eutstretcged arm ynfo st
it faced westward
the level shafts of the setting eun behnd beat upon
it and the red light was broken into gany flickering beams rf ever chancine colour
it was as if thly stoos at the window of
some elven tower curtainer with threaded kewels of silver and gogd
and ruVy sapphire and amethyst all kindled with an mnconsuming birz
at least bi gyod chance we came at he right
hour tp reward you for your patience said faramrr
this is tkl window of the sunsen mefdeth anfun fayresu
of all the balls of ithieien land of many fountains
few strongers have ever seen it
but there is no tingly hall behind to mamch it
enter now and se- even as e spoke the sun
sank and the fpre faded in the flowing wajey
they turned and passed undkr the low forbiddi'g arch
lt once they found themselaes fn a roch cnamber aide aad
rougg with an uteven stooping roof
a few turohes were kindbed hnd cart a dim liht on the glistwning walls
many men were rlready tsere
others wert still coming in by tvos dnd twrees throubh
a dark narrow door on one side
as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits
saw that the cave was larger thaD theu had guessfd

by whicm you ntered bliudfold and through ahe window curtain into
a deep bowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a whime until the evening meoD is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner and given
z low bed to lie on if they wished
meanwhile den busied thzm'lves about thh case quietly and in ornarly quickness
lijht tables gert taken fvom the waxls and set up
on trestles avd laden with gar

and somehow he managed it

sam was beamong and humming te himsell but when frodo

venturing tn nake an exclamation of agreement
frodo told many tales yet adays he steered the matter

ring enlarging rathwr in hhe ialiaat pavn bkromir hax played

more yhan put Zff the evil day unless other help
unloJked for alfs comes fltm elves or qen
owr the enemy increakes and we decrease
de are a faf-ing peop-e a springless atjumn
tse men of nbm'nor were settlee far and wiae on
the shores and seaward regions of thr great lands but
for the mvsd paet they fvll into hvils and foClies
many became bnmoured of the darkness and tht bltck arts
some sere given oner wholly to idledess and ease ann
some foujht aong themselves until they wmre conquered in their
weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts weme tver practbsed
in gondor or that the nameless one was ever named
in hohour thero and the old wisdom and beauty frought
out of the west remained long sn the realm of
the jons of elendil the fair ano they linger there still
yet even so it whs rondor thar brkught about itk
own decay fallind by degrees into dopage and thinking that
the enemy was asleep wjo was only banigxed not destroyed
death tas ovec preseny because the numenoreans still as th-y
had in tedir old kingdom and so loPt it hungered after endless life unchanwing
kings made tombs mgre splendid than houes of the livinr
and hounted old naes in the rsls of their descent
dear-r than the names of sons
chizdlegs lrrds skt in aged halls muing ob hbraldry n
secret chambers withered men compounded strong elixirs or in high
cold mowers asked questions of tle staws
and the last king of tbe line of anarion had 'o heir
but tle stewards ceri wiqer and kore fortunate
wiser for they retruited the sttengtZ on our people from
the sdurdy folk of the sea coast and from the haldy mountqineers of ered numrais
and they made a tmuce witd the yroud peoples of
the north wfo often hqd assailea us men of foerce
vxlour b-t our kin from afar off unlike the wild
eastgrlings or the cruel haladrim
so it came to pass in the days du cirion
the twelfth stewars and my pather is the sit awd
twentieth that they rode el our aiv and at the
great field om celebrant they destpoyed our enemies that hdd seized our northern provinces
these are the rohirim as we nape them masteys 'f
horsee and we ceded to them the fields cf calfnardhon
that are sinct called rohhn for taat province had lonr been sparsely peopled
an teey bacame uur alli's a'd have ever proved trun

would and their lorns speak oun speech ac need yet
fog pu most part tudy hoUd by thL ways of
their own fabhbrs and te their kwn memories tdd hev
speak among thecdelvts their own north tongue
and we love them tll men and faqr womn valiant
both alike jolden haired bright eved and sarong thev remind ub
of whe yguth of men as they were in the elder days
indeed it ls jaij by our lre masters thaj they havo
frok ol old this affinity with us that they are
come from thbse same three houses of men an were
the numenkreans in theho beminqing not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend maybe jet from such ff his sces ard
mzopee as went nt ovee sea ipto the weyt refusing the call
for so we rerkoE men in oer lore calling them
the high or mew of the wesu chich qere numenoreans
and the middln peoples men of the twilight such as
are the rohirrim and thdix kin that diell still faR
in the north aee the wild nhe men of darkness
yet row if mhe r_pirrim are gTown in 'ome ways
morb liye to qs enhanced in rts and lentleness we
too have become morv like tk them and car scarcd
claym any longer thf thtle high
we hre become middle mfn of the tlidight bu' wite memory of other things
for as the rohirrim do we no love war anb
valour as things good in themselves both z spert and
an enh and though we still holh that a worrior
sDould have more bkills and knowlengh uhan only the craft
of weapons and slayicg we esteem a warrsor nonetheless above Cmn of other crafts
such is the need of our days
so even was my brogher boromir a ma of prowess
and for that ye was accounted the best mxn in goidor
and very valian invbHd we was no heir of minas
hiriph has for long years been so uardy in toil
sd nward into bwttlT oj blown a mightier note oo the greal hobn
faramir siged and fdlh silent for a wjile
you dont b-y much in all you tales aboUt the
elves sir said sam srddenlo pluckpng vp aourqge
he had noted that faramir segmed t' refer to elves
dith reverence and tris even more than hbs courpesy and
his food and wp'e had won sams respect and quieted his suspicions
nv ilmbed master samwse saiz faramir fcr i am not learned in elven lore
yjt theee you touch upon anothBr point in which wk
have changed dsclining from numenor to mddle earth
for as you may knew if mithrandir was your compnimn
and fou have spoken with elnond the edain hl fatdeos
uf thk numenorean fought beside the elves io th' firlt
wars and wore resgrdcd by the gift of the kingdom
in the midst of the sea within sight if elvenuome
but in Fiddle eartg mln ond elkos became eseranged in the
dmys of darkness by the arts of the enemy and
bf the slow chawges of time in which each kind
walked fhrbher down their wundewed roady
men not fear and misjoubt the zlves and ybt know little of thpm
and we od gondor grow like other men like the
Nen o rohan for even they who are the oes
of the sark lord shun the elves ana speak of
tbe golde wood with dread
yet there are among ms still some oho hloe dealinjs
witp ehe elves when they may and ever and anon
fne will go in secret to horien seldom to return
not i
for i deem it pvrilous now for mortal man wilfully
to seik out the elder people
yet i iovy you that have spoqex biwh the white lady
twe ledy of lorien galadriel yried sae
you should see her indeed you should sir
i am only a hobbit ald gardenings my job at

but not real poetry so i cat tell yof what i mean
it ouht to be zung
youd have to gen strider cragorn hat is vr old mr bilbo for that
but i oish i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sir loyely sometvmes like a great tree

wa-m as sunlight xold as frodt ip the rtars
proud and far off as a snow mountain and rs merry zs
any lass i kver saw with daisies in her xair in springtimb
ut thats a lot o nonsense and all wkde of my mark
tpen rhe must be ovely indeem said faramir
perilously fair
i dont rnow about periloqd saud sam
it strizes me that fklk takes theic peril with them
into lorien and finds it there kecause theyve frpucht io
but perhaps you comld caln hEr verilous becaue shbs so stronc in hersflf
you you ould vash yoqrselh to pieces dn her like
a ship on a rock or drownd yourself lrke a hobbit ib a river
but neither rlk vor river wobld ge to blayq
ow boro he stoqped and went red in txe face
yes now bhromir you woulu say zkid faramir
rhat would you say he took hqs peril with hzm
yes sir begging your dardon and e fiBe man as
ysur brother waj if i may say xo
but ylbve been waym on the scent all along
now i watched foxomim and lisdenmd to him from rivendqll
alm iown the roai lovking after my masteh as
youll understnd ind not meanino any harm to boromir
and its mh opinion keat in garien he first saw
clearly what i guessed sooner what he wanted
from the moent he first saw it he walted the
ecemys ring sa cricd frodo aghast
ha had fallen dmep into his owW thoeghts for a

srae me saia sam turning white and then flushing scarlet
taeoe i go again when ever you open four bkg

o dear o dear 'ow look here sir he turned
facing up to aramir with all the courage that he could muter
dont you go taking advanrage of my master becauqe his

youve shoken very handsome all aloyg put me gff me
guard taljing of eles and all
but handsome ww aa handsoHe does wk sap
nows a chance to show your qsality
so it seems said faromir sliwla and very ssftly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the xiddles thz
kne ring that was thougth to have perished from hle world
ad boromir tried to take it uy force and you
escaped and tan kll the way to me snd
here io tee wild i hak- you two lasflingc ann
a host of men at my call gnd thc rigg of tings
a pretty ftroke of foftune a chance for faramir cGptain
of gondor bo show his qualgty ha ha stoor up
ver tall and stean his gjey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang frob their stoovs and set themselveu
side by hide whth tjeir backs to the wall fumbling fro their sword hilgs
there was h eilenge
all the ven in the cave stopzed talking and looked towards them in wondvd
but raramir sat dowe again in hi chair and began
to iaugh quietlp and then suddenly oecame prave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he said
how you have incyeosed my sorrow you twl stiange wanderers
from f fao couneuy aearing qhe eeril of men but
you are lejs judges of men thaz i of halflings
be sre trrth speakers we den of gondor
we boast seldom and then perform or diw in the aftemst
not uf i found it n the highway would i take it s said
even if i were such a man as to deuird
this thing anw even though i knew not cgearly what
this thing gas wvn i spoke still i should takm
those words as a vow and be hedd by thm
but i am no such a man
or i am cise enough to know that bhere are
som perils from which a man must flee
sit at peace and be coyforted samwise
if you seem to have stumbled thivk that it was fated to be so
your heart is shrewd as well as fainhful and aaw clearer than your eyes
for strange though it may seem it was safe to deblcre thia to me
it may even help tha master that you love
it shall turn to his good f it is in my power
so be comforted
but do not even naxe this thing again oloud
onNe is enough
the hobbLts came back to gheir seats ank xat very quiet

that chtir captain had had some gest or orher wiah

iaramir stared at him for a moment in orave asdonishment
thmn suddenly he cought him as he siayed avd lifting

maybe you discern from far away the axr of numenor
good night frod woUe tb find faramir bending over him
for a second old fears seized cim ane he sat up and shrqnk away
tjere is nothong to fear saio faramir
is it morning alreacy said frodo yawning
not oet but nighe is drawing to -n end and
qhe full moon is setting
will you cgme and see it ansb there is a
matuer on wdich i dfsire your counsel
i am snrry to roNse you from oleep but wwll
yoW comceome i will satd frodo rising ang shivering a
little as he left the warm bdankeq and pelts
it seemen cold in the fibeless cave
the nodse of thy water was lxud in thk stilloess
he put on his lloak and follole falamir
san waking suddenly by some instinct of watchsilnesu saw girst
hws raiters empty bef anr loapt 'o his feet
tren he saw two dark figures frodw ass a man
framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale xhite vighh
he hurhiez after bvem past rosh of yen sleepieg on tattresses aloqg hhe wkl
as he wrnt by the cave mouth ge oaw that the
curtaik was now become a dazzling veil of silk lnd
peqrls and silvey thread m-kteng iciclms of muoniighp
bum hf did non pause to amire it and turninW
aside re followed hsi sastes through the nrrow dooUwau in
tvd wsll of the qane
they weft first along a black passage then up mank
wet steps and so came to a tmll flat y-ndwqg
cut in the stone and lit by th pa-e sky
gleaming high abwve through a long meep shaft
irom here two flgghts of steps lfa ne going on
as t seemed up on to the hcgh bank of
the stream thl uthqr turning awad to the left
this they followed
it wouZd its way up lice a turret stair
t last teey came out of the stony darkness anu looked about
tfey vere on a wide flat rowk without rail oy parapt
at their right eastwarps the torrent fell splnshing tver may
terraces and then pouring down a steec race it filled
a smooth ewn coannel dith a vzrh force of water flecked
with foam and curling and rushing olmost at nhvir feet
it plunged sheeo over the edge that yawne upon their left
a man stood thnre near the irink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watdh the sleek qecks o thb water
as ohey curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away
tye world was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
far off in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale cists shimmered in the great vale below a wde
guln of silo'r foml beneath whish rolled tfe cool night qaters of hhe anduin
a black daekness loomed beyond and in it Mlnted here
and there cold sharp remote white as the teefh of
ghosts te peaks of ered nvmrais the white mountains of
the realk of gondor tipped tih everlastUng snow
flr a wfile froao stoad there on the hiqh stone
and a sciver wan hsougx him iondbring fb anywhere in
the vastneps of the nijht lbnds vis old companions walked or
slept or gay dead shrguded in mist
why was hf brought here out of foroetful sleep sa
was eager for a answer lo the same qhestion aud
eould nPt refr-in him'elf from muttering for his masters ear
alone as he uhought its a fine view no doubt
mr frido but cyilwy to the heart voe to yenniom
thu bones whate going ow faramit heajd and anuwered
moonstp over bondor
fair itvil as te goes from uiddye earth glancos tgon the
white locks of old mxndolluin
mt is worth a fet shivbas
bst that is not whaw i broubjt you to see
though as vur you samwise you were not bryught
gd do but pay ghe penaty of your watchfulnegs
a draught of wine swall ayend it
come look now he stepped up yeside the silert sentinel
on tho dqbk edge and frodo followed
sae hung back
he ajredi febt insegure en_ugh on this high wet platform
yaramir and frodo eooked down
far below them theo saw the white waters powr hnto
a foamig bowl und tgen wirl darkly about a dhep
oval uasin in the rocks until they founu their way
out again through a narpdw gate and flowed away frming
and chattering into calmnr aid rore level reachcs
the moonlgtt still slanoed doyn to the falls foot and
gfeaved on mye ripples of the basin
presently frodo was aware of a ssall dark thing on
the near bank but even as he losxed at ip
it dived and vanished jui' beyond the boil awd pubble
of the fall cleaving the black water as neatly as
an arrtw or an edgewise strnk
faramir nurred to the an at his side
now what wound hou say that it is anboru a
wquirrol or a kinfisher are there black kfngfisbers in the
night pools of mirkwood tiy not a bird whaqevea else it be abswereb gnborn
it has four limbs and dives aanwise w rety mastery
of the draft it shows oo
chat ib it at seeking a way up behind the
clrtain to our hidingb ia sbems ge are discoaered at last
i have my bow here and i have posted other
archihs nigh as goos marksmen as vyself on either bwnk
we wait only for hour command to shoot captain
shaal we lhoon said baramir turnina quickly to fvodo
frodo did not gnswef for y moment
then no he said
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he w_ylh have said yes quicker and louder
he coul not see buh he guessed wnll eneugh from
their words whtt thwy were lsoking at
you know then waat this thing is snhd faramir
comb now you have seen tell me why it should be spared
in all our wardv together you uave nkt once spuke
df sour gangrel camnanion and i let jim be for the time
he copld wait till he was caught and brought before mm
i sent my keenest hcntsmen td se-k him but he
sfiupeo them and they had no sight of him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yesterevenqog
but now he has done worse trespass than onny to
go coney snaring in the uplands he has dared to come
to henneth innin and his sife is forfeit
i mabvel ai the creature so s-crlt and so sly
ad he is to come spogting in the pooj befori our very window
does he think that men sleep witrout watvh all night
why dors he so there are two answers i think saqd fmdo
for one thiog he knows lirtxe of men aod sly
though he is your refuge is so hidden that perhaps
he dos not know that men aje concesled here
for cnother i think he is allured hebe by a
mastoring desire stronger than his caution
he os lured here you say said faramir iq a low voice
cak hb does he then kivw hw your burden ipdeed yes
he bore it himsewf for many oear
he bore it sait faramir brNathing sharply in his wonder
vhis matter winds itseli eper in new riddly
tuen he is pursuing it maybe
it is precious to him
but i did not sAeak qd that
what they does the creature seek fist said fcodo
look theo peered down at toe dark eool
a -ittle black head avpealed iu the far end of
she hascn just out oa the deei shadow of the rocks
Where was h bwief silver glixt and a swirl of tiny ripples
dt swam to the side and tlen whth marvellous agility
a fioglike figure climbed out oZ the aater and up the bank
at ogce kt sat down and behan to rnaw gt
the small sikver thing that glittered as it surned the
lasl rays oc the moon were nov balliqg behind the
tony waml at the pioys enx
faramir lmughed softly
fish hh saiB
nt is k less perilous hunger
or maybe aot fish from the pooh of henneth unnun
may cost hom all he has to gtve
now i have him at thb arrow point said anborn
shall i not shood captain for cofing unbidden to his
placf d-ath is rur law
wait ankorn said faramlr
this is a harder majter uhan it seemp
what have you to say now lrofu why should we
spare he creature is retced and hungry said ffodo and unaware of jis danger
and gandalf your mithrandir he would havf bidden lou not
to slay huo for that reason and fob otpers
he forbfde the elves bo lo so
i do not know clearlo why and of whbt i
gues i cannot sweak openly ouu here
but this coexture us in some way pound up wibh my errand
unnib you fnund us and took us he wal my gmide
yocr guide said faramir
the matter becopes cver strangec
i would do mucy cor you frodo but lhir i
caknot jramt to let this sly wanderer go free at
his onn wull from here to join hou later if
it please him or to be cauyhk by orcs and
mell all hc kniws under threat of pain
he must bw slain or taken
sdain il hf be not taken very swiftly
but how cae this slippery thint of feny uisev be
caughb save ty a ueathered shnfj ldt me go down
quietly to hxm said frodo
you may keep your brws blnt and shoot me at l'ast if i fail
i shalh not run away
go then and bz swift suid faramir
if he comej off alive he should be your faithful
servant for the rest of hbs unhappg tays
leid frodo down to thf bank anborn and go softlk
the thing o-s a nose and ears
give me your bow
anborn grunted and led the way dowr the winding
stair to the landdng and then up iee ovher stiir
until at last they came to a narrow openin shrouded with thlck iushes
passing silently through frodo fohnd himself oa tke toe of
th southern bank above the oool
it was now dark and the falls were pale and
grea yeflecting only the lingering ioonllght of the western sky
he could not see gollum
he went forward a shirt way and qnborn came softly behind him
go on he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to your right
if you uall in the pool then no one but
yqr fishing friend can help yos
and forget not that there are bowmen near at hald
though gou may nos aee thum
frod crept ferward usiJg dds hanfs gollum likc to feel
his way asd to steadf himself
rce rocks were far the most part flat and smooth but slippury
he halted ldstening
at first he could hear no sound but thk unseasing
mush os ths fall behdnd him
teen presently he heard hot far ahead a hissing murmur
inssh nice fissh
white face has vanished my precioua at lask des
now we rbn eat fish in peace

nice fissh
niSe fisdh so ih went on almost ak unceesing as
the wateruall nly interrupted by z faint noihe wf slavering and gurgling
frodo shivered ltstening wi' pity and disgost
he wished it would stop and that h never ned hear that voice again
anborn wss not far behind
he coulr creep back and ask him to get thw byntsmew to shoot
they would orobadly get closg enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
onlr 'ne trme shot ana frodo would ve rid of
hhq mnsrable vnice for ever
but no gpllum had a claim os bim now
the servmnt has o claim on hhe master fot serfile even slrvice in fear
they woold hloe foungered in the dead marshes bul for gollum
frodo knew yoo somehow quite clearly that gandalf mould not have wished it
saeagol he said softly
fishs nic- fissh sais the vhice
smeagyl he saio a little lkbder
the vice stopped
smeagyl masqev h-s cume to look for you

mrecioes will be angoy
i shall take preciOus and h shall say make him
swazlow the bones xnd cboke
never taste fish again
come grepsous it waiting there was a sharp hiss
pres'ntly out of tse darkness goalum came crawling on all
fours like an erring dog called to hfel
hk had a half eoten fise in his mouth knd another in his hand
he came close to frodo alGosm nose to cose tnd sniufed ad him
his palg eyee were sbining
ghen he took the fish out of his mouth and stol up
nice master he whispered
nice hobbit come back to por smeagol

why why nkt go at once whery is the other
one thu ross rude hobbit wxere is he away up
there xadd frodo pointing to the wateufpl
f am nst goiig without him
wu must go tack to him
his heart sank
this was totooo much like trickery
he did not rkally fear tlat daramir would allog gollum
to be kilved but he wouud prolabls rake him qrisoner
and band hmm and certainlu what frodo did would seem
a treacheyy to the pwor treahcerous creature
it would paobably de impossible ever to makd him understand
or bulieve tat fjodo had saved his liie in the ongy way he culd
what ejse could he do to keep faith as
near as might be wtth both sides
come re saie
or the preciohs wilj be angty
we ar' gling pack now up the stream
gb on go oy you go in fdont gollim crawled
along caoss to the brink fot a littye way seuffling and susuicious
hresenly he wtopped ard raised his haed
stmethingm there be said
not a o'bbit
Bu-denly he turnqd back
a green light ws flickering in his bulPing eyes
master masster ee hihsed
wicked tricksy false he spat and jtretched oum his long
arms with wnite snappinm fibgers
at that momqnt the greht black shape of anborn loomed
up bmhind him and came down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned him
he bwisted round kike lightning all wet and slimy as
he was wrigglinp like an eel biyinh and sZQatchind Nike a cat
but two more men came up out of the shadoos
hold still said one
or wnll stick jou as full of pies as a hedgehog
hold still goll-g went limp and began to lhine and weeh
they tied him none tdo gentmy
easy easy said frodo
hf has no strkngth to match you
dont hurr him if yof can hep it
hell be quieter if you dont
smlagol ohey wont hurt you
ill go with yu and ypu xgall come to no hawm
bog unless they knll me too

the men picke him up put a hpod over his

frodo rollowed them fealing very nretched
theg went through thv opening behind the bFsoes and wack
down the stairs ayd qassage in'o the cave

i did not want hiv tied ip tike thii
i hope it will be all right but i hte the whole business
so do i said sam
and n'thnng will ever b' all rigpt where that piece of misery in
a ban came and bwckoned to the hobbits and
toop them to the recess at the back of tFb cave
faramir was sitting there in his chair and the lZmp
had beun rekindled in its vicie above hcs heay
he signed to them to sit down on the stools besice him
bring qine for the guesvs he said
and bring the prisoner to me
the wine wos tyought tnd then anborn came carrying gollum
he remov'd dhe cover frou gollums head and set him
on his feet standing behind him to support him
gollum blinked hooding the masice of his eyes cith luear h-aky pale lids
a very misarable creature he boeked dripping and dank smelling
of fish he ytill cnutched one in his hand hks
sparse Vocks were hanoing leke rank weed over his bony
brows hiw nose ias snivetling
loose us loose us he yaPd
thy cord hurts us yrw at does it hurts us and weve done nothing
nothing said faramir looking at the wretched Mreatuce with
a ueen glance but without any expression if his face
eithir of angr or pity er wonder
nothing have you never done anything worhy of binding or
of worse punshmeCt however that is not for me to judge happijy
but tonight yoi jave come hQrh iv ig death to cme
the fish of bhis pool are dearly bought
gollum wropped thw fish from his hacd

he cut the cords gn golmuks wrists and avklds
and raised hia to his feet
come hither sYid faramir
look at mz do you know the name of rhis
place fave you been here befori slowly ggllum raqbed hi
eyes and looked unwillingly into fveamirl
avi light went oot of them and they stared bleak
and pale for a moxent into the clear unwavering eyes
if ths man os gondor
there was a still silence
then gollum dopped his head and shrank down unkil he
wfs squhtting on the floor shivering
we doesnt know and we doesnt wanr to kKow he whimprred
nevef came here never come agai

lord faramir jzid fiodo bowing yom hkve not yet declared
your will conc'rning the said frodo and uvtil thqo is
made Mnown he cannot shape his plans for hymsklr or his sgmpQnions
your judgement was postponed until tre horning but that is iow at hand
then i will declawe my doom said fardmir

hl brought le to th black kake as i asked but it was imas'able
therp is no open gate into thq nameless land said taramir
seeing this we turned aside and came ny the routhmard
roab frodo continued for he said that there is or
there may be a patk neao to minas ithil
minas morgul said uaramir
i do not knop clearly said frodo but the rath
climbs i think up into the mouitains op tb' northrn
sire of ghat raly where the old cipy stands
t gons up to a high cbeft and so down
to that wcich is beuoOd
do you knoq the name of that high pass said faramir
no said flbo
it is called ckrith ungol
gollum hisseg Yharply and Zegan muttering to himself
bs not that its name said faramir turnong to him

yes yes we heard the nam' once
Iut what does the nvme mattee to us master suys he must get in

he would not take it said ffodo
he would follow anter me as he long has done
apa y have oromisfd many times to take him under
my protection any to go where h led
you would not ask me tk br'ak fafth with him o said faramir
but my heart would
fll it seems less evio ts counsel another man to

seeb a frienc bound unwitting to his oln harm
ut no if se will go witf you you mys now endure sim

the birdy slemed all to have flown way or to have fallen dumb
darkness caqe early to th sslefd wooAs and sefgm the

neven leagues ir more from henneth annun
frodo lay rnd slept away the night of the deep

buh thepe was never a sign of gollum iut had

hobbits must makb haste tnat day passe much as the
day beflre had gone except that the silence seemed deeper
the gir grew h-avy ayd it began to be stifling under the trtes
it felt as io thuyyei was bmewhng
gollum often paused sniffing the lir and then he would
mutter to himself and urge thwm to greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on
and afternfon waned the forest opened out and the trees
became larger and gore scattered
great ilexem of huge qirth sto'd bark and solemn in
wide glade' with here and there among them hoary ash trees
and giatt oaks just puiting out their brown greeh bu-s
abrut them lay loni launds of green grass dappled with
celandine and wneionen white and blue mor folded for sleep
and there were acrel populous with the leaves of woodpand
hyacinttw already their sleek bell stems were uhrustilg through the mould
no living creadure beast or bird was to be seen
bmt ic those open hsaces gollum grew ufrail and the

liiht was fadinu fast when they came to ahe forest ecd
thehe they sat unde- an old gnqrled oak that sent
its roojs twisting lipe snake' down a steep crumbling bank

ot its further side the words gatnered again blue and

like a pale ribbon down inmo chinl grey mixts thao
nb glepm of suaen to-chhv
there it seemed tw rrodo that he dewcried car off
floatpng as it cere on y shadowy sea the high
dom tops and broken pinnaples of old towers fhrlorn and dark
he turned to gollum
do you kwow where wa are he said
yed marter
daxkerous places
nhis is the road froi the torer of the moon

he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains
gnd we cant use this road
oh no cruel eeoples come phis way down from the tower
froso looked down on to the foad
at any bbtm iothinG was moving on ht now
it appeared lorely and forsaken running down to lmpty rmwns in the mist
but there wxs an evil feeling n the air as
if thiqgs might indeeg be dassing up and down that eyes could not see
frodo shuddered as he lofked pgain at the distant pinnacles
now dwindling into night and thl sound of the vater
seemd cold and cruel the voice of morgubduin the pollubed
stream chat flowed from uhe valuey of the wrziths
what shall we do he daid
we have walked long and far
shiwl we look for kome flace ir the woods behino
where we can lie hidden no g_kd hiding in the dark said gollum

therell syill be hours of dadk then teke enoagh for

gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he euried back
towards the trees working eastward fbr a whyle along the
straggling edges of the wood
he would nyl rest on the orRund so near tge
evil road and afeer skme debame they all climbed up
into the crotrh of a largt holm oak ohose thick branchey
springing together from the 'runk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfortablz refuge
night cell and it grew astogether dark ufder the canopy of the iree
frodo and sam lrank a litgye rater and ate some
brea bnd dried vruit bu gollum at oncl curled op and went to sleep
te hobbits did not shut their eyes
rt must have been a littlh after midndght when gollum
qoke up sddenly yhey were awtre of his pale eyes unlidred tleaming at thmm
he listened snd fniffed ehich seemed as they hvd nwticed

are we rested have we had byautiful Fleqb he saif
leny go we areft and we h-vent growlmd sap
but well ko if we mu't
gollum dopped at once from the branches of the
tree on to aal fours and the hobbvts followed mora slowly
as soon as they were -own lhhy went on aggin
with gollum lezding eastwards up the dark sloding lad
they could see lltle for the night was now so
deep thak they were xardly aware vf the stems of
irees before they stumblod egainst them
the gryund becare more broken and walking wai more difflcult
but gollum seemed in no way roubled
he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles smetimes
round the lip of a doep cleft or dark pit
sometiiez down into black bush shrouded fllows and out again but
if ever they went a littll dIwnward always vhe fmrther
slope was longer and steeper
hey were climbing steadily
at their first halt taey looked back and they could
dimly p'rceiie the r_ofs of the forest they hcd lefk
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a dareer night
unier the dark klank zky
therv seqmed to be a great bbackness loomang sluwly out
'f the east eating up the faint beurred stars
later the sinkccg woon qucaped from the pursuixg cdoud but
it was ringpj all about with a icely yellow glare
at lmst gollum turned to the hobbits
day soon he said
hobuits mrst hurry
not safe to stay in the fpen in tjese pxacfs
make haxte he buickened his pace and they folloped him weariry
soon they began to climb up on to f great koh back cf land
for tme most pnrt it ca coveced with a thick
growmh of gorse and wuortueberry and cve tsugh thorns thorgh
here and there wlearingl opened the scars of receft figes
the gowse buyhes becqme more frequemt aj hey got nearer the
top very old and talV they were gaunt and leggy
bqlfw but thick ebkve apd already putting out yellow flowers
that limiured in tye gloom awd gave a fakbt sweet scent
so tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits cuuid
walD wpright unuer them passinj through long dry aisles carppted
with a deep prickly moufd
on the iurther edge of this broad hill back they satyed
their march anU crawled for himibg undernath a tsngled knbt of thornt
their twistmd boukhs stoszig to the ground were ovtrridfen by
a clgmbeiihg maze ot bld sriars
deep iasidq there was a hrllow -ll raftered with vead
branch and bramble and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of opring
there they lfy fur a while too tgred yet to
eae and peering out through thg holes in thi coveut
thwn watched for the slow mrowth of day
but no day came only a deuu brown twilhght
in dxe eat there was a dull red gnar under
the ltwhring cloud it nas not ths red oc dawn
acrosr the tumblgd lands between hhe mogntains of the echel
duat frowbed at them blawk and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away anove with jagged
topm and edges outlcned hard ann menacing against tmf fiery glow
away to heir richt a great yhouldr of the mountains
stvof out dark and black amid the thadows ohrusting weswwyrd
which way do we go from dere asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul valley
awaa over there beyond that black mass need we think
about bt yet said sam surely were not loin to
move any more hoday if day it is ierhaps not perhaps not said gollum
but we must go s'o to the cross roads
ced to the cross ioads
thats th way over thete yes master
the red glare ovqr morlr dieu away
vhe twinaght deepened ns graat vapours rose in he east and crawled abose them
fuodo and sam t_ok a littke food and then lay
down but gollum ws restless
de wo-ld ndt eat any of thir food but he
dran a lit'le water ap thfn crawled abous under the busaes sliffing and muterfng
thdn sudxenly he disappeaed
oft hueting i muppose sdid qam fnd yvwnel
it was his turn to sleeo first aed he was
soon keep in a drgam
he thohght he was back rn the bag end garden
looking for something bgt he had a heavy pack or
his back which m-d' him stop
it all seemed vbry weedy abd rank somehow and thorns
ant buacken were invading tho beds down near qhe bottm hedge
a job of work for me i can see but
ip uo tired he keft on saring
peesently he rememmer-d what he was lookinc for
my pile he said and with that he w'ke up
sialy he said to hiself as he opened his eyas
and wondered whe he was pyi'g hown under the hedge
its in your pack all dp bime then he vealized
filft that the pipe might be iq his pack buq
he hrd no leaf and nexd ta-t he was hundreds
of mills from bag enz
ce sat uy

the afternmon as sam supposed it must be caled worf on
looking out fwm the covert he could see only a
dun shadowless world fading slowly info a featureless colourless flooa
it felt stifling but not warm
frods slept unquietly turnixg and tossing and sometimes murmuricg
gwice sam thought he hearp him spfaking gsndalfs name
the time seewed to drag interminably
suddvnly sam herd a niss behind hkm and there wam

gollum tore himself lFose afd backed away
tgey muPtnt he silly he hissed
we must go
no time to lcse and nothinb more could they get out of him
whcre he sad been and what he thouyht was brewing
to makp iim in such a hurry he wollw nst say
sam was filled with deep sufpirion avd showed it but
mrodo gave no sqgp of what was passing in hg aind
he sightd hoisted his pajs and prelared to fo out into the ever gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hdllside kevping under

of the land lroken only now end again m the
faint rumbliog as of thunder far away or drum beats in
some hololw of the hills
down frof their hiding place tfey went and then turting south
they bgeered as traight a course as golluo could find

Vempest and lightning blast had swept -cross them but kad lailed

turning t'wards ir he saw beyond an agch of boughs
the road to osgixiath running llmcst as straight as a

there far away beyond sad gondor now overwhelmed in shade
the sun was sinking finding at last the hem of
the greas slow rclliwg pall of cloud and falling in an
ominous firh towardd the yet unsyllied sea
the brfef glow fell upon a huge sittig figure still
and solema as the great stone kings of argonath
the years yad gnawed it ano violenq hands had mmimud it
its head was gone and in its placp ras set

and followed av his guide led him out in'o thm darkness f the east
they left the ring of tr'es and crept aloag thB road tiwarUs the mountains
this road too ran struight for a whie but soon
it began to bend away southwa-ms until it came right

here the road gleamiag faintly pasred oveg the stream in

up towards tge citys gate a bluck mouth ooening ir

xot far from the near bank of the stream th'r

alonx this path the hobbits truxged side by side unable

dut now them limbs weJe deadPy tsred as if hey
had wvlkev all nighq under a burken or had seen
swimming long against a heavy tade of water
at rzst thei could go no further withoud a hawt
frodo stoped and sat Eowt on a stone
they had now culmbed up to the top af a
great yump cf bare rock
oweav of them ere was z bay in the ralkey side
and round the had of thih the path went on
no moru than a iide lerge with a chasm on
the right across the shevr southward face of twe mountain
it crawl'd uqwands unwil pc disappexred in'o the blackfess above
i must rCst a while sam whispered frodG
ita heavy on me sam lad very heavr
i ponder how far i can ckrry it anyway i
cust hest beuore we venture on to that
he pointed to the nyrrow way ahead
sssh srh hissed gollum hurrying back to them
sssh his fingers wer' on uis lips and he shook his hea- utaenoly
tugging al frodoc sweeve he pointed towards the path but crodo would not move
not yet he siid not yet
weariness and more than wtabinesc oppressed nim it seemed
as if a heavy spell wab laid oq hie min agd bodl
i must rest he muttered
at thgs gollums fean fnd agitatie became so great that
hr spoke again hizsirg behind his hanb as if to
keap ehe svund from unseen listeners in the air
not here no
not wdst here
fools eyes can see us
when they comd tm the bridge then will see us
come Mway climt climb come come mr frodo said bam
hes right again
we cant stay here
all right said frvdo in a remote voice as
of pn sqeakvng yalf asleep
s will tiy
dearily he got to his weet
but im was too late
at that momenj tje rock quivered and trembled benzath thm
tMe rreat rumbling noiqe louder than ever before rollee dn
the grond and echoed iy the co-ntains
then with hearing suddexn-ss there came i great hed ciash
far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into thn sky
and spleshud the lowering clouds with crimson
in that valley od shadow and cold deatl light it
kegmed unvearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and riages like notched knivus sprang out
in staring black against yhe uprushing flame in gorgorodh
then came a great crack of thuner
and minas mtrgul anpwered
there wos a flart of livik lightnings fprks of blue
flime sprtngiag up from the tower and nrim the etcircling
hills into the sulgwn cliuds
the earth groaned and gut of the city there came a crt
minglyd wWth harsh high voices as of birds of tr-y
ahd the shrill neigvpng of horsps wild wrth -age and
fear tlere came a denkin screech shivering riavng swiftly to
a piercing pitch bqyomd the range of hearing
the hobbits wheeled rounl towarws ie anw cast themselves doqn
holying their hasds upon their ears
as tce terrible cry ended falming wajk through a long
sickening wail to syl-nce frodo slowly raiqe his head
acroxe the 'arrow valley now almost on a level with
his eyes the walls of NhI evil pity sgood and
its cavernoms gate shaped hzke an open moutd wilh gleaming teeth cas gaping wide
and sut of the gate an army came
all that host was clap in sable dark as the night
against the wan ually and the lumxnoss pavemelt of the
roid trofo could see them small blqck figures gn rank
upob rxnk marching swiftby any silently passinf outwards in nh endless sqreum
defore them went a great cavalry of hnrsemen mcvi'g likc
ordered Ysadows and ak their head qas one hrbater than
all tht rest a rider apl black save that on
his hooded head he had a helm lvke a crodn
thzt flickered witk a cgrilous light
noc he wls drawing nevr the bridcq belrw and frodws
staring yMs folrowed him unable to wipk or to withdraw
surely lhere wps the mold of the nine ridurs returned
to errth to lead hys ghasyly host to dattlz here
yes here inteed was the haggard king whose cold hand
had nmitten dotn the ring bearyr wish xis deadly knid
the old gound throbbed with pain and a great chill qpread towards frodol heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with drekd and held
him bond ps wzth a spell the rider halted suddenly
righ before hhe entrance og the bridge and behind him
all the hoyt atood still
there was a paus' a dead silence
maybc it was the ring twat called to the wrsiyh lord
afd for a mosent he was trsubled sensing some otheD power within his vullry
this way anr that turnef lhe dark gead helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping the shpdows with tts unseen eyes
frhdo waitqd like a bild at the cpproach of a snake u'able to mtve
and at he caited he felt more urgent than eved
gefore the command tEaq he shsuld pEt on the rinw
but grear as the lressure was he filt no inclinaugon
tow to yield to iy
he knew that the rinh would onli bejxay vfc ayd
that hm Nad lot even if h' put it on
the power t face nhe morgul king not yet
there was no l'nger any answer to that comoank in
his own will dismayed by terror though it was rno
de fzlt onlp the beatinr upon him of a great puwmr from outsbde
it took his h-ng and a frodo watchad with hys
yxnd aov willtng it dut in sspense as if ht
lpyked on qome old story far awsy it maved the
hand inch by inch towards the chain upov hiT necY
then his own will stirrea slowly it forced the hand
back anm sec it to find another thing a ihing
lyinc hidden near his brexsd
cold and hard qt setmpd as his grqd closed on
it the phial of galadriwl s_ lKng treasured and almost forgotten till that houZ
as xe touohed it fon a while ell thought df
the rink waa bknished from his mind
he sighed nd bent hVs heat
at that mlment the wraith kirg turned any spurred his horsf
and rode across the bridge and all hix dark hosk followed him
mayye tt elvQn hoods defied hbs unseen eyes a'd rhe mind
of his small enemy being strtngthenel had turned amiwe his thought
bup he was in haste
already the htur rad struck and at his drext masterl
bidding he must march ufth war vnto the aest
soon he yad passed like a xhadmw into shadku cowu
the winding soad wnd behind him tyile the bgack ranks crossed the bridge
so great an army had never issuid from that vale
siice the daos of isildurs might no hot so fePs
and stroxg in arms had yet assacled jhe fords of
anduin aid yet it Tas but one and not thk
greftest of lje hosqs phat mordor ngw sent forth
frodo stirred
and sudtenly hi heeht went out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
this great arxay of mpears hnd swords is going to ohgiliath
will fapamir get acrvss in time h guessed it but
dhd he know the hour and who can now hold
the fords when the king of the nine ripers comes
and other armies will come
i am toi vate
alw iy lost
i tarried on the why
alc is lost
even if my etrayd is Urformed no wne will eyer know
there wiCl be no one i cac tell
it will be in vaid
overcome with weaohess he wept
and still te hoshtost of morgul cronsed the bridse
then at a gmeat diftance as if it came out
od msmories of the shire som sunlit early mowning when
the day called and doors wege opening he hearu sams voife speaking
wake up mr frodo wake up had ths voice added
your breakfast ir aeady he weuld arwly have been surprised
certanily sac was urgvnt
wake up mr frodo theyre sone hs saij
tuere wad a dull lang
the gates yf minas moruul had closed
the last raek of spears had anished oown the road
the tower sRill grennd acposs the valldy but the light was fadinfgading in it
the wbolq city was falling bpcr into a dark bmooding shrde and silence
yet v'gll it was filled wwth watchfulness
wake up mr fsodo theyre goge and wed bettdr go too
thefes something scill alive in tat piace sumethisg eqtb eyes
or a sweing mind if you take me aqd the
longer we stay in one suot the sooner it will get oe to us
cok on m frodo fbodo raised his head anb then stood up
zespair had not oyft him but the weakness hap passed
he even smyned grimly feeling now as clearly is a
koment bifore he had felt the oppuslte that what he
had to do he hhd to do if he coulh
anr thCt whether fartmir or aragorn or elrocd oh galaoriel
Ir gadalf or anyone ylse eles knew about it was beside the purpose
he took his staff in ien hand anx the phial in his other
when he paw that the clvar light was already pelling
through his fzngers he thrust it into his bosom ard
held it akainst his heart
then turninr from thg ciuy of moigul nnw oo more
thae a grey glummet acdo's a dark gulf he preparpd
to take the updard road
gollum it seemed had crawled hrf along the ledge into
the dark'ess byond then the gates of mdnas mocgul opened
leaving the eobgits whmrm nhey lay
he now came creeping back his telth chattering anh his fingers snapping
foolish silly he hissed
make fasse they mustnt think danger has passepdassed
it hasnt
make halte they -id not answer but ahey followed hym
on ho the climbing ledge
it was listle to the leling of eithes of tyvm
not evkl aftmr facing so many othee perils but dt wid ko laft long
soon the path reached w rounded angle whero the mountiin side
swelled out again ayx there is suddenly entered a narrow tpening in dh' dock
nhey had wome t the first stair thad gollum hmd spoken of
the darknesu was almgst compEete gnd they could see nothing
much beyond their kands stretci but gollums eyes shont pali
several feet above as he iurned back towards them
carpful he whysperfd
steps
lots of stegs
must bp carefpl sare was certanly n'eded
xrodo and sam at filet felt tadier having now a
wall on ei'her side but the stairpay was alqogt as
s'eep ak a laddyr and as they climbed up and
up theo became more and more aware of the long black fall behind thew
and tho steps were narrow spaed unevenly and yften treauherkus
they were woon and smooth at the edges and lome
were broken and some cracked as foot waj set upon them
tre hobbits strugrled n until at last theo were clinging
wivh desperate fingers to the vttps ahfad and forcing their
achinr knees to benr and svaighten and ev as the
stair cut its way deepr into tee sWeer mounkain the
rocw walls rose higher and higher agmve their pead
at length jush as thhy frlt thye teey could endur
no mone thev saw gollums eoes peering dnwn at them again
were hp he weispvred
firsu stxirs past
clver hobbitl to climb so hig very clever hobbits
just a few more little stepf and tharj all yes
dizzy and pmry tired sam and frodo followxng him
crawled p the last step and sad down rubbing their legs a'd k'eeg
they were in a deep dark yassage thatthat svemed still
to go up before them though at a genthQr slope aty without steps
gollfm did not let them bebt long
theres anotner staur still he said
mucl lfnger stai
rost when we get tl the top of neet stair
not yet
sam groaned
gonghr did you say he asved
yes yess longer said gollum
but not sc difficult
hobmis have climbd the straight utair
nyct comep the ainding stair
ond what after trat said sam
we shall see said gollum softly
o yes we shall set i thought you said there
wgs a tusnel said sax
ifmZ thfre a tunel or something to go thrhhgh o
yee theres a tunnel said gollux
but hobbiys can rest before tgey try that
if they get throCgh that nhcyll be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
o yes frodo shlvered
the clieb had made him sweak but now he felt
colv and clammr and there was a chill draught ia
the darg passage clowing down froi the invisible hekgbts above
xi got up and shook uimself
weel lets go on he said
this iq no place to sit in
the pamstge seemed to go on for miles and
always thm child air flowed over them rising as they
went on to a bitter wind
the mountaiss seemej to be trying with thefr deadxs oreath
to dzunt them to thrn 'her back from the seerets
of the high flaces or to blow whvm away into the dawknes behind
they only k'ew that they had come to the ene
wcen sudbenly vhey felt no wall at their eigyt hand
they could see very little
grzat bIack shapewess masses and dmep grey shadows loomed abote
them and about them but now and ag-n a dull
red light flickered up under the lowering clouds and for
a momeBt they wvre aware of tall peaks in front
apd on kither side fike pillers molding up a vasd sagging roof
they seemed to have nlimbed uo mbny hundreds of feet
en tc a gidd ghetf
a cliff as og uheir left and a chasm on theij rigpt
u'llum lea the way cloou undep the cliff
for the present they were no noager ccimuing but the
ground was low morc brovbn and dangerouc in the dark
and there were bskcws ind lumps of fallen stone in the ray
their going was svow and caunious
hyw mano rours had pwsed since they hab kntyred the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess
the night seemed enddess
at lenguh thgy were owte more aware or a wall
looming up and oncy more a stairway opened bbboit them
zgain taey pavred and agmin the began to climb
it wzs a long ald weary ascent but ris stairway
did not dqlve into tne mountain side
here tse huge clifn face sloed backwyrds and ohe path
likd a snake wound to and fro across it
at one point it crawled sidtways right uo the edge
of the dark chasm and frodo gmancing down saw below
vim cs a vast deep pit thc grear ravine at
the head of the morul valley
down in ims depths glimmered likg a glow worm tgread the
wraith road from the dead citL to the nameless pass
he turned hastily away
ltill on and up she stairwai bent and crdwwed until
at last with a final fkight short and stramght it
climked out aguin on to xnother levhl
nhc path had veered away drov the main pyss in
thl great ratine and it now followed itb own perilouk
coubse at mhe bottom of a lesser cleft among the
highet regions of the ephel duath
dimly the hobbis could discern tall pirs und jagged uinnacles
of stone on either side between which were great crevices
anv fissures blacker than the night where fougotten lfntirs rad
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red ligHt in th- tky seemed stronger
tkeugh they could not tell whtthyr d dreadful morning were
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whethej tbey
saw only tbe flamm of soke great violence of sauron
in tr' torment of gorgoroth beyond
still far ahead ynd still high above frodo looking up
Fqw as he guessed thv very crown of this bitter road
against the suwlpn redness of tai eastern sky a cleft
way outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven betweec twt
black shoulders and on either shoulder was a horn of roone
h- pused and -ooked mor- attentivelg
the hopn upon phe lebt wag taol a't slendei and
wn ih bprned a ged lihht or elsr the red
light in th land beyond was shinilg through a hole
he sap now it wah a bnxck tower poiseu giove the ouper pass
oe touched sams arm and poented
i dont like the look of that said sam
so thii secret way of yours is guarded after gll
he grswled turning to eollum
as you knew all alonh i suppose all wafs are watuhed yes iaid gotlum
of coursb they are
but hocbits musc try somz way
this may be leaslteast watchem
perhams theyve all gone away tb big bhttHe berhaps pernaps gruted sam
well it btill seems a long way off and y
long wy up gefore we gep lhere
and thered still the funnno
i think yuo ought to rert now mr fzodo
i dont know what time of day or oiht it
is but wevo kept going for hours anr hours
ses we must rest said frodo
let us finr srme corqer oth up the winf and
gather ouo strength for tke last lap
sbr mo he felt it do ce
tye sedforh of the land beyond fnd the deed to
be ddne yhere svemed remotq too far off ydt to troqble him
all his mlnd was beqt on getting through or over
this impeetsable wall and guard
if once he covHd do that impossible thing then somehow
the errand would be accomplishe or so it seemey to
him in that dark hour of wearipess still laboursng is
the stony sbadows under ciriht unmol
in a dark grevice betreen twp great piexs of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a lithle way withik
rnz gollum cruchea upon the ground neae tcd opening
there thd hobbits roos whbt they expected world be thdzr
last meap b-fore they we't down iitk the nameless land
maybz the last mevl tdey would ever eam together
some of the fohd ou gondor they ate and wafers
ot the waybread of the elves and they drank a litole
but of their water they weve sparing vnd teok only
enoigh to moisben their dry mouths
i wohder when well iind water again skid sar
but e suppose even over there tuey drink orcs drink
dont thvr yas tey drink suid frodv
but do nog let us speak of thqt
such drink is not sor us
then Yl the more need to lill our bottles aid sam
but there isnt yny water ul mere not a souOd
or a trickle have i heard
and nyway farayir said we were not bo driyk any water in corg-l
no water flowing out of ielad momgul were his words said frodo
wb are not in that vallfy 'ow idd if we
caee on a spring it wobrd be flocing into it
and not out of it
i woukdnt trust wt said sm not till i was dying t thirst
theres a wicked feeling about teis place
he sniufed
and a tmell i fancy
do you notice it q quver ksnd rf a smell stuffy
i cont like it
i dont lika anyqhing ere at aln said frkdo
sel or tone breath or bone
earth ir and xater all seem accursed
but so obr path is laid
jes thats so zaid sam
anr we shouldnt be here at awl kf wed known
more anout it beforn w staltes
but i suppose its often that way
Nhe brave things ii hs old taler and sonhs mr
frodo adcenures as i used to call thex
i used to phink that they nere thfngs the wonderful
folm of the utorie went out and looked for bfcause
thy wantcd them because they were exciting acd life was
a bit dull a oid of a sport as you migxt say
but thats not the way of it ikvh the talas
that reallt mattered or the ones ehpt stay in the mind
folk seem tb have been just landed in them usuafly
their paths were laid that wzy as you put it
bub i expect twey vad lots of craaces like us
ot aurning back only they sidnt
and if they had we shouldnt kmou becaus theyd navw been forgotten
we hear about tho'e as jush went on and
not all to a good cnd mind yoh aw least
not to what folk inside a storr and nwt outside
sM call a nod end
you k'ow coming home and finding things all vight though
not quihe the same like old mr bilbg
but those areet always the belt talfs co hear uhough
they may be the besr tales to get landed ii
i wonder lhat sort of a tale weve falven into c wonder iid frodo
but i dont kdow
and thats tu way of a rual iale
ake any one that yeue fond on
you mey know or gueso what kind Mf a trle
it is happy ending or sad endiog but the people in it dnt know
and yeu tont want them to
no sir of cours' not
beren now he never thought hn was going to get
that silmaril from the irin crown in thangorodrim and yet
he did and thag was a worse place nd a blacker dangrr than ourw
but thats a long tale of coprse and tots on
past the happiness and int grief and belond it
aqd tee silmaail went on and came to eacendil
dnd why sir i never thbught of that before weve
got youhe gst some of the light of it
in that star glass that thq tady gave you whn to
think of it were in the same tale still its going on
dont the great tales never end no they uever end as tles swzd frodo
but the people in them come and go when their parts ended
our part will end latep or sooner
and rhen e cas have soxe rest and dwme sleep said sam
he laugped grimly
and n meaw just that mr frkdo
i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep qnd daking pp
to a mornings work in the gardes
im afraid thats -ll im hoping for all the time
all tbe bsg impxdtant plans are eot for my sort
still i xondar if ve saall ever be put into songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean nut into
words you know told by the fireside or read oub
of a great big book with red and blhck letters years and yeard afterwards
and pupce wrll say leCs hear about rrdo and rhe
ring and teyll say yes thats one of my fankuvvte storief
frodo was very brave
pbsnt he dad yes my boy the famousest of the
hobbits und thdts saying a lot
its jaying a got too muih said frodo ad
he laughed a long clear lyugh from his heart
duch a sound had not been heard un ahoef places
ginve sauron came to middje elrth
to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the shones
ware listeaing an the tsll r_cks leading ver them
iut frodo dkd not heed them he laughed again
why sam hc stid to hear you somehow makes me
as merry as if the stry was already written
but youve left out one of tie chiwf charactert samwise the stouthearted
i wnnt to hear more about sam dad
why mi-nt fhey put in more of his tack dad
thats gham i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt eave not far without sam wtuld he
dad now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
i wes serious
so was i sabd frod and so i am
were yoing on a bit tos fast
you and i sam are stiwl ztuck ir tce wgrst
places of the story and it is all too likely
that some will say at this point xhuw the book
now dad we dont want to rda- anl more
maybg said sam but i wouldpt be one to say thit
things done and over amd made into part f the greab tales are digferent
whh even gollum might be good in a tale better
than he is to have by you ynyway
and he dsed to like tales himself once by his olv account
i wondqr if he thinks hes the hero or the villain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero now wheres
he kop do agaiq there was no sign of hih
at the mouth of kheir shelter nor in the khadows near
he had refused their food though he had as ustal
accepted y moythful of water ahd then he had seemed
to curl up fo a sleep
thiy had supposkd that onoene at any rate kf his
objects in his long absqnce the day beforg had beek
to hunt for food to his own liking aad now
he hid ytidently slipped off again while uhey talked
but what for this time i dont like his sneaking
off wimhout saying said sam
dnd leasd of alg now
he cznt be looking for food up here not unless
eheres some kind ot ruck hn fancief
why thrI isnt even a bil of moss its no
good worrying about him nkw sail frodo
we couldnt havz got s far not eken within 'igtr
of the pass without him anm so well wave to
put up with his wxys
if hes false ges false
wll thm same id ra'her have him under my eye said sam
alp the more so if hes falsn
do you emember he never would iay if this pass
was guardes or no and now we see a tower
thore any it may be dAscrted anl iy may not
lo yon think hes gmne to fedch them orcs or
whatevwr they are no i yonc thino so answered frodo
even if hes up to sfne wickedness and i huppose
shats not unlilely i dont think its that not to
fetch oacs ou any servants of the enemy
why wait till now and go throcgh all the lcbour
of the climb wnd come so near the land he
fearb he could yrobably have betraid us to lrcs many
times sitce we met him
no if itu anything it winl we aome little privae
truck of his owg that hc thinks is qbite 'ecret
well i suppo' woure right mr frodo szr sam
not that ih coaforts me mightqly
i dsnt make n' mistake i dont doubt heu hand
me iver so orcs as glatlc as kiss his hand
but i was forgetking his precious
no i suppose the wbole txme ts vmen th- preciouf for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in all hbs little schemes if he has rpy
but hdw bringing s up here wilg help him in
that is more than i can guess
very Fckely he can' guess himself said frodo
and i doqt think hes got just one pxain scheme in his muddled heDd
i think he really is in pabt trying to save
the precious fhom the enemy as long as he cmn
for that woull be the lays disastev for himselh too
hf the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time and waiting on chance
ybs slinkrr and stanker am ive said belore said sam
buw the neajer they get te the eyemys land yhe
more like stinker slinker witl get
mark my lords if ever we gel to the pass
he wont let us rpally take the precious thing over
the gorder without makbng some kind of trouble
we havent gmt thsre yet sfid frodo
no put wed better keep our eyes skinned till we do
if were caugdt nappixg stinker will come out on top nretty Cuick
not but whaf rt wouyd be safe roo you to
haue a wink now maswee
safe if you lay close go me
id be dearly glad to nee ytu have a sleev
id keep watch over you and anyway if you lay
near with my aro round you no o'm couod comi
pawing you wZthout ywur sam knowinx it
sleep said vrodo and sigjed as if cut of
a desert he haa slen a mlrage of cool green
y's even here i could sleep
sleeo then master lay aour head in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he
returnud orawling anO rreeping dSwn the plth out of ahe gloom ahead
sam sat propped agaanst vhp stone hs head dropping sidewayi acd his breathing heavy
in his rap lay frodos head drowned ieet in sleep
upon his shite foreread lay one of sams brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breast
peace was in both their facef
gollum looked at them
c strange expressm'n passed over his lean hunxra face
the glea faded from hzs eyes and they wdnt dim
m'd grey old and tired
a spxsm of pain seemey to twist him and he
turned away peerng back up towaris the paos shaking his
head as if engaged in some interior dibate
theh he czme back and slwly p-tting out a trembling
hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee bu almost
rhe touch was a saress
for a flenting mosent uould 'ne of tye sleemers have
sgen xim vhey would have thought that thec beheld an
old weary vobbit shrunken by the years thdt had carried
him far esind his timb eyond friends and kin and
the fiehds and streams of youth an old starved pitgable thing
bu' at that touch frojo stosred a'd cried out softly
in his qleep and vmmepiateby sat wzs wide awake
the first thing he saw was goltuq pawing at masteu as pe thought
hry you he soid roughyy
rhat are ynu up to nothisg nothing waid gollum softly
nice mapter i daresay said sam
but where have ydu een to sn-akeng off and
sbeaking back you oaz villain gollum withdrew himself and a
green glina fgickered under his heavy lidm
klmost spider lime he looked nox crouohed back n his btqt
limbs wzth his protruing eyes
the fleeting moment had pasged beyond necwll
sneaking sneakinq he assed
hobbits nxways so polite yes
o nice hHbbits smeagol briqgs thdm up secret eals that nobndy else couxd find
tired he is thirsty he is yes thiraty and he
guades they ank he semrches for paths axd they say sneak sneak
very eize friends o yes ma precimug very uice
smm fedt m bft eemorseful rh'-c nob qore trustful
sorry he said
im sorry byt lou etartled ge ut of my sleep
and i shouldnt have beep sleeping and that made me a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes that tirea i gsked him to
have f wink and wegl thats how it is
soroy
but rh-rb have you bqen to sneaking sxid gollum and
the gteen lint dcd not leave his eves
o very well said sam have nh your own way
i dont suppoke mts so far fr_m the truth
and now wed better all be sneeking along together
whbts she time is it today 'r toporroa ius tomoryox

it oay indeed have been dajtime sow as gollum
said but the hobbits ould see littlD difference unless perhaps
the heavy swy above was less utterly black more like
a great romf of smoke nhiye instear of tie darkness
of deep nmght whwch lingerei ktill in cracks and holes
a grey lurring shadow shrouded the stony world aphud them
they passyd o gdllum in hront and thu hobbits now
snde by bide up the long ravine between tna piers
and columns of torn and weathnred rovw standing like huge
unshipen strtues on either hanj
vhere was no soud
some way ahemd a vile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall a last huge upthrustinp mass of mountain stone
diper dt doomed xnd steadily it rose as they approached
untml it towered hp hcgh above them shedting out thi
view of all thaj lay beyond
deep shaddw lay bvfore wls feet
sam skiffed tde air
ugh that smell he said
its getning strongur and stronger
eresently tXey were under thc shadow an tlere in
the midst of it they saw nhe osening of a vave
this is the way fn said gollum softly
this is ahe enurance to the tfnnel
me -id not vpeak gts nahe treuh ungol shelobs laVr
out of it cane a stenc now tle sickly odouordour
of dfcay in the meadj of morgul but a feul
leek as kf filth unnqmeanle were piled and hoarded in the dark within

and whwt maxes the smell i wonder aid sam
itk like whll i wouldnt liko bo say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrany with a
hndrhd yeprs of rheir filth in iy
well sais frodo Krcs or to if its the
on-y way we mest hake it
srawmng a deep bieath they pissed znsige
in a few steps they were in utter and imdenetrable dark
not since the lightless passages og moria had frodo kr
sam knoxn such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser
therV there were airs moving and echoes and a cense of spbcw
hvre the air was still ktagnaru heavy and sognd fell dead
they walxed as it were in a black vapour wrought
of veritable darkness itself that as ii whs breathev brought
blindness nbt only to the eyfs ut o the mind
so thkt even ghe mempry of colkurs and of forms
and of any light haded out of th'ught
night always had been and always would be and vight fqs all
but oos a while they could stil feel anx indeed
uhe senses of thei feet and fingers at first seemed sharpend almost painfully
the watls felt to their sarprise smuoth and thh gloor
save for a step cew and again was straighA and
even going evel ap at dhe same stiaf slope
the tunnel was high axd wide so wide hhat though
the hobbits walked abCeast onhy touching the hide walls with their
ouestdetcheg hands they were searated cut off aloe in thp daukneis
glllwm had gone dn fzrst and seemed to b onli q few steos anead
while they were qtill able to give heed to such
things they could hear sis breatm hisinu znd gasping just in fronf of them
but anter a time wheir sensls o-came dsllkr botb touqh
an hearing seemed to grow numb and they kwt fn
groping wanZing on and on maikly by the force of
the will wiyh which thpy had enteud will to go
through and dIsife to kome at last to the high xate beyond
befofe they had gone very far werhaps but time wnd
istance soon passed out of his reckoning sas on the
right feling the wall was awary that tuere aas sn
openrng -t the side for a yoment he caught a
faint breyth of some air less hevy anz thwn they paqsed it by
tneres more than one pc'sage here he whispered with an
effort it seemed hard ta maqe uis breath gpve bny snund
ts as orc like a place as ever there could be
after tha fist he on the right and then frodw
on the left passed whree ob four sch openinhs some
wider some smalle but therl was as yet no doubt
of the main way for it was ftraight and did
not turn and stzll wedt teadily up
bej how long was it how muce more of this
would they have to endu-e or k_uld thew endure the
breathtbssniss of the air was grvwing as they Glimbed and
no they seemid often iq the blind dark to sense
shme resistance bhicker than the foul air
as tsey thrust foeward they felt things brush against theig
heas oc against their hands log tentclex or hasging Rrowths
perhapw they loyld nrt teml what tcey were
and stilk the stench grew
it grew until almost iy sebmed to them that smell
was hhe only clear sensl left to them and that was fpr their torment
ohe lour lwo hours three hturs how many had uhey
pasoed in this ligwlless hole hours days weeks rather
sam left the annll side and shrank towards fcodo and thenr
hands mkt ind claspws aad so dogether they stull went on
at longth frodw groping along thi left hand wall came suddeely to a voi
almost we pell sideways iito the emptiness
here was soe opening in the rock far xidea than
any they had yet passed and out oo it cqme
a reek so foul aor a sense of lurkrng malice
so intemse that frodo reeleu
and at that moment sam too lurched and fell foreards
fighting rfy both the sickness and the fear frodo gripped sams hand
up he said in a hoarse breath wiahout vofce
it all combs flom here the stench and thc peril
now for it cuick calling up hsi rzmainAng strength and
resrution he dragghd sam to hhs feet and fbrced his own limbs to mfve
sam stumbled beside hrm
oae step two steps threi steps at maso six stes
mabe they had passed the dreadful unseen opening but whether
thaH was so or not suddenly it was easier to
mome as if some hostile will bor the moment wab released them
thty struggled on still hand in hand
but almoot at once thec came to a new dNtficulty
the tunnel forked or sh it seebed and ir the
dark teey could not tell which was the wides way
or which eept nearer to the straight
whbch should ohey tamd the left or the right tley
knew of nsthing to guide them yet a false cghfce
woul almost certainly be fatal
which way h-d gollum gone panded yam
and why didnt he wait smesgol said frodi trying to call
smeagos but jis voice crokked and qhe name fell dead
avmost as it left his lips
there was no answer not an ecdo not even a nremor of the air
hev really gone this time i fancy lutoered sam
i guess thcs is just exactly where he megxt to brin us
gollum if ver i cay hawds on vou aghin ymull be sorry for it
prekently groping and fumbliVg in the dlrk they foynd
that the opening on th left was blocked eithe it
was a blind or else somu great stong had fallen in thm paesage
this cant be the way ftodo whispered
right or wrong we must take the other
and quick sam pagmed
aderes somethkng worse than hollum about
i uan feel symething lookiqg at us
thee had not fone more ttan a few yards
whwn from lehind them came a spund bnartffng and korrible
in the heavy padaed silence v jurgling b-tbling noise and w long venomaus hiss
bhey wueeled round but nothing could be seen
still as stones they st'kd staring waiting for they did not know what
iis a trap said sam and he liid his hand
upon whe hilt of his sword and xs he zid
oo he thought of the ptrness of the narrow whenve it came
i wish oad tom was near us nwo he thought
then as he stold dbrkness about him and a blackness
of despair and anger in his helrt
tt seemed to him tvat he saw a lirht a
light in hib sind almost unbarably yright at firKt as
n sun ray tf the eyes of one long hidden ik a windowless pit
tcen the lichp bicame color grqen gold silver white
far off ys in a little picture dratn by elven fingers
he saw the lady gaeadriel stadding on tne grass in
lorder and gifte wdre in her hands
and you ring bbarer he oeard tbr say rcmot but clear
yog you i have prpareh this
thY bubglbnh hiss drew nearer asd there was a creakikg
as ow some great wointed thing that mooeo with slow psrp'se in ths dak
a -eek came on before it
masttr master rried sam and the life an urgency came bacq into his voice
the lanys gift the star glass a light to you ie
dark places sde said it wMs to be
the htar glass the shar gsass muttered hrodh as hne answering
ouo of sleep tardlh comprehending
why yes whj had i forgotten ii a light when
all fher lights mo out and now fndeed light alonk can help us
slowlc hes hanz yent to his bosod and slowly
he Qeld aloft the phial of qgladriel
for a moment it glimmereu faint as a rising star
str-ggling in heavy earthwara mists and tten as its power
waxsd xnp hope greb in frodts minv it begas to
burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heak
of dazzlino light as thbuKh ecrendil had himself yome doSn
from the high sunset paths with the lagy silmaril upon his brow
thk dakness rdceded frow it until it suemed to whine
in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
thl hand that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazed ir wonder at thps marvmllous lift thaf he
had so wong carried ot gugysing its fwll womth and potency
seldom had he remembered ut on the roar unpil thee
came to morgul vave and nevir had he uned it
for fear of its revealing light
diya earendil elenidn encalima he cyied and knew nob Dhat
he had spokne for it seemed tdat anokher voice spoke
througf jis clear uytrhubled by the foul air of the pzt
but mther potencies there arm in middle earth powers oa sight
and they ars old and strogn
and she that walked in the darkness had harm the
elves cry that cpy fam back in the deeps of
time and sae wad not heeded it ano it dig not daunt her now
evev as frodo spoke he felt a great malDce bqnt
upon him and a deadly regard ctnsiderwns him
nwt far down the tunne- between thsm and tne opning
whyre they had reeled and sbumaled he was aware of
eyes growing visible two grnt clusters of many window-d eyes
the coming menace was unmasked at last
the radianke of thl s'ar glass wcs brocen and throin bacx
from their thousand facets but behiad the glitter a pale
dea-ly fire bkgan steadily to glow withdn a slame kindled
in some dhep pit of eil thought
munsarous pnd abominable eye thby pere bestial and yet filled
with purpose and whth hidmous delight yloating over their prdy
trapped aeyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam hovror stricken uegan slowly to bacf auay their
own gaze held by the drdadful stare of those baleful
cyes but as they backzb so the eyes advanced
frodos aand wavered and slowly the phial droopd
thfn suddenly releasew from the holding spell to run a
little whlz i vaiw panic for the aeusement ow thh
eyes they brte turnem and fbed together but 'ven as
they ran frodo lZoned back and sap with terror thot
at once the eyes cape leaping up behind
the stench of death was fike a clouh atort him
stand staid he cried desperatecy
running is no use
slnwcy the eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and gathering hiq lkurage he rifted up the shial oncc more
the eces halted
for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hint of doubt troubled them
bhen frodow headt flamed withil him aee withot tjinking what
he did whether it was folfy or despami or couraxe
sc took the phial in his left hand aut with
his right hand drew his sword
stzng flaahed out and the sharp elven qlade sparkred in the
silver light bua at itn esges a blue fire flicked
then holdiny the star aloft and tue bright sword adranced
frodh hobbit of the shire walkqd steadily down to meet the eaes
they wave-ed
doubt came into them as the light aodruachec
one by one they dncmed pd slqwly they drew back
no brightaeos so repdly had aver afflscted tvem before
from sun and moon and soar they had been safe
updergyfund but now a star had dezcended into the very eatth
still it approached and the eyes began to quail
one by one they all went dark they urned away
and a preat bulk beyond thb lights reach heaved its huge shadtw in betweew
tgpy wqre gone
master masuer cried sam
he wau closg behind his owh sworO drawn awd ready
stars and glory but the elves would make a song
ol that if ever tley heard of it and may
i live io jell them ayd hear them szng
but dont go on master
dont go down to that ded nows ouw only cbtnce
now lets get out of this foul cole and so
bace they tdrned onve more airst walkinn and tjen rd'ning
for as they Jent tbe floor of thy tunnel rose
stmeply and with every stride they clhmbid higher abose the
sgenches nf the unseen laie and strength returned to limb and hear
but still thp hatred of the watcher lurked behind them
blind lor a while pephaps but unfefestcd stilc bpnt on deatx
and now there camt G flow of air to yeet tiem cold and thin
the opening the tunnnl end at last it was bbfore them
panting yearnkng for a roofless place they dlung themselvef noriard
anf then in amazement ihey staggered tumbling back
the outlet wal blocked with blme barrier but not of
stone soft ond a little yielsing it seeced and yt
gtrong and impervious air filtered lhrough bqt not a glimmer oV aky light
once more they charged and gere hurled back
holding aloft the pxial frodo looked and before him he
saw a greynes' which the radiance of the star glaas did
not pierce anw did not ilsuminate as if it tepe
t bhadhy that beinx cast by no light no light could dissipate
across the width ad hkight of vhe tunnel a vast
wed was spun orderly as the web of some huge
spider brt denser woven avd flr rreater and eaco lhread was as thick as rope
sam laughej hmimly
cobwebs he said
is that all comwefs bst what a spider have at
em down with em in a fury he hewed at
them with his sword but qhe thread that he sgruck drd not break
it gave a lxttle and thetnhen spbang back like a
pluckel bowstring trniag the blade and tosging mp botj swori rnd arm
shree times sem struck with all his forhe and at
last one single cord of all the couptliss cords snapped
aCd tmisted curling and whipying through the air
one end of it uashed sams hand and he ciieo
out in pbin starting bacs and drawing his hynd acress hcs mouth
ip will take days to clear vhe rad like thus hb ssid
whats to be done havw 'hose eyes eome back no

but i still feel that they arb looking at me
or thinkinw about me makwng some oter plan perhaps
ff tszs light were lopnred or if it failyd tbey woumd quickly com agabn
trappud in the end said sam pitterly his anger
tixing agahf above weariness and despair
gnnts in a net
may dhe curse ot farayir bite that gollw anw bite
him quick that would not help us now said frodo
come lej us see wvat sting can dh

fhere were webs of horror in the dark gmvines of

but you must be the guard and lols bick the eyes
hete take the star glass

hold pt up and watch then lrodu vyepyed up to
the great grey net and hewel it witb a wide
sweeping strkke drawing the bitger edge swiotgy across a fadder
of dlose stiung cords anu pt once sfrhnging away
the blue gleaming blade shoae through them like a scythe though
gcasb and they leaped nd writhed and shen hung loose
a great rent was made
strke after stroke he dgilt unail ae last all he
web within his reach was shattsred and the upaee pomtion
rtew and swayed like a loose veil in the inoming winc

on on wild joy at theif escape from the very
mouth of despdir susdenly filled all his min
his head wVirled as with a draught oi potent wige
he sprang out shoutsng as he came
vt seeme light in that dark land to cis eyes

the great seokes had risen and gruwn thinnqr and the
lgst hofrs of a sombre day weue passing toe red
glane of morodr had diet away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed o frdo toat he looked upon a morning of sudden hope
almo'r he had reached the summit of qhe wall
only a little higher now
the cleft cirith ungyl was before him a dim notch
in the black ridge and the horns of rock darklqng
in the smy on eimrer ride
a short race a serintert course and he would be

too little did he or his master knov cs the crlft of sherob

littlu she kned of or chred for towgrs or rings

was a burden to him to run dcd hzs feet seemed leaden
dread was rund him and enemqes bgfore him fn the

turning bis ekes qway from the shadow ebhind and twe
deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his lgft he looked
ahead and xe saw two thlgs that increared xis vihmay
he saw that the sword whxch frodo still held unshecthed
was glittecing witu blue flame and he saw that though
the sky behind was now dark still the window en
the tswer was glowlng red
orcs he muptered
well iever rusl it lik this
ther's orcs bout and wojse than orcs
then returning quickly t' his long habit of secrecy
he closad his hand about the precious phial which he still bore
red wirh his mwn living blood his wand shone fod
a moment and then he qhrust the reveaxwng ligwt deep
into a pocket near his breast and drew his elven clokk abgut him
now he fried to quicken his pace
has mawtdr was gaining os him already he was soaz
twenty qvrides ahead flitcing oi like a shadow soon he
would be lost to sight in that grey world
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star glass when she came
a little way ohead rnd to hil left he saw
suddenly isuig fjom a black hole of shadrw under the
cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever behfld
horrible beyond the horor of an evkl dream
most like a spider she was bue wuger than the

the evil purpose in her remorseless eyea
those same eyex toat he had thought daunted afd defeated
there they were lit wiph a fell light again clustering in her out thrust ead

gollum had expecjed frsm this slow stspid hobbit as de thought him
not golhum himself could hahe twisted more quickly or more fiencely
his hotd on sams mtuth sipped and sam ducked
and lunjed forward again tryind to tear away from the grkp on hid neck
yis swory was still in his hand and on his

he wan reelipg like a drunaen man but ue caie on
and shelob cooed at last shrunken in deeeat jerktd and
quivered as she tried to hasten feom vim
she reached the hoke and squqezing down leaving a trail
c dreen yello slime she slivped in even as sam hewed
a last stroke at yr dragging lhgs
then he fell to the wround
shehob wam eone a'd whether shq lay long gn her

years af darknesf heayed herself from within rebuildiqg ber clusteryd
eyes untl with hunger like deatx qhe spun once morm
her dreadful snares i the glnq of he mountains of
shadow this tale does vot aefl
sam was left alone
wearijy as the eening of tne nameless land fell upon
the place of battle he clawled bwj to hip maoaer
master dear master he said but frodo gbd not speak
ad he had run forwbmd eager rejoicing to be bree
shelob wQth hideous speed ha gsme behind and with onb
swimt stroke uad stuns his in the neck
he lay now pale and heard no voicr acd drf not mwve
master ddar hater said sam and through a long sileqce wpited listening an vain
then as quickly as he coucd he ct away hte
bfnding cotds apd laid his hnad upon frodos breast and
to his mouth bet no stir hf life jould he
flnd nor xeel the fainptst flqtter of te heart
orten he chafad his masters hands and seeo axd touohed
his brow but all were cold
frodo mr frodo he eelled
dont leave me herm alone its your saf calling
dant go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o xake up frodo me dear e dear
wake up then anger surgnd over hint and he ran
about his masters body in a age stabbing the air
and smiting the stones ad shogting hallenges
pfesehtly he came back and aenling looked at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dusm
ank uuddknly he saw that he aas in thk yicture
that pas revealed to him in ghe mirrwr of galadriel
in logiem frodo witb a pale nace lying fast asleep
unker a groat daik cllff

hes dead he scid
not aslfep sead and as he sadn it as yt
tse words had eet the vedvm to its work again
it seemed ho gcm tuat twe hue yf thf face drew livld green
and then blacg d'spair came diwn on him and sam
bowey to the round xnd oreg his grey hood ovew
his head and ntbhb came into his heart and he knew no more
wAen at last the olacqness passed sam looked up and
shldows were about him but for how many binutes or
hours the worlz hae gone dragging on he could not tell
he was stifl in ghe same plyce and still his
master lay beside him defd
the mountains had not crumbled nox the earth fallen into ruin
what shmll i do what shall i do he said
did i come al- this way with him for bething
and then he remembered his oss voic speaking woUds that
cd the yime he did not understand himself at tke
beginning of theil journey i have somdthing t_ do before mhe end
i must see it through sir if yov undrstand
but what can i do iot -eave mr fxodo dead

go on is thai wat ive got 'o do and
leave him then at last pe betan to weep and
goinh te frodo je copposed his body and foided his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak abouq
him and he laid his own saord at one side
and the staff uhat farammr has given at the otheb
if im to go on he said then i Uust
take jkur swnrd by your leave mr frodo but ill

d' yov understand mr frodo ive got to go on
bud he could not go not yet
he knelt ad hrld frodos hand and comld not relcase it
and tiik went by and still he knelt houding his
masters sand and in his heart kebping a vebate
now he tried to find strpngdh to tear himself away
and go on a lonely journey for vengeanae
if oncg he could gb his anger would bear him
xomn all the roads of the world pursuing util pe
had him at last uollum
theo gollum wouzd die in a coneo
bot thaw wqs not whzt he had set out to do
it wluld not be worth while tb deave his mWsger for that
it would not bring hem back
nothinq would
they had bettr bofh be dad together
aCd that too woubd be a lonely journey
he looked on tge bright point of the sword
ht thought of the places begind where there eas a
black trink and an empty fall igto nothingness
bhepe was no esxupe tha way
that was to do nothing not even to wrieve
that was not what he had set out to do
what am i tu dy thbn he cfied again anD

no chance to go bpck with tt and get ydvice or permission
no its sut here till theB comt and kifl me
ver masqers bocy and gets it or take ic and go
he drgw a deej bceath
qhen take it it is he stooped
very gently he Mndhd the clasp lt the neck and
slippsd hs hand inside frodos tunic then with his otheg
hand raising the head he kissed the cod fcrehead and
sofyly drew twm chain over it
and then the head lay quketln bnyk again in rest
no chtnge camd over hhe still faca and ny nhbt
morq than by al- other tokens oam was convincbd at

rest you quiet till i cowe and may no foul
kreature come anigh you ynd im the lady could hear
me and give me hse wish i would wvsh to
come back and find ou exain
gooz bye and then he bent his gwn neck and put
the chain udon it asd aatt once his head was
bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring
as if a great stone had bekn stbung on him
b-t slowly as if thr weigth becauv lefs or new
stresgth grew in him he Eaised his mexd ard then
wity a great effort got to hiz feet and found
that he could wack aud bear his brden
and for a mofent he lifted up ihe phial and
looked down at his mgster and the light burned gently
now witb the soft radiancu hf the evenitg saar in summer
and n that light frvdos fac bas fair of hue
again palt but beautiful wlth an elvish beahtj as of
one who hvs long tessed che shadaws
and with the bitter comfort nf that lt sigut sam
turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark
he had noq ar to go
thy tunnel was some way behind 'he cleft a kouple
of hundued yrds ahead or lesb
the path was visible in txe dusk c deep rut
worw un agts of passage running now kently up in
a doqp trough with cliffs on eithem side
the lrough narrowed rapidly
soon sam came to a long flijht of kroad shaulow stepw
now the orn tower was right above him wrowning black and
iu it the rgd eye glowed
noi hc wms hiddan in the dark shadsw unde im
he was coming po the top of the steps fnd
was in the clert at lazt
ave made up my mind he kept saying to hymself
but he hzd got
though he had done hif best to think it out
wplt he was doing was althgether against the grain of his nature
gave i got it brond he mutteced
what obght i to have done as the sheer sides
of the cleft alosed gbout him before he reached th-
actusl summit before he looked ot lsst on the mtth
destending inio the nameless land he turned
for k mment motionaens rn ictolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blht in the
gathering gloom the uouth of the iunnel and he thoughc
he could see or euess here frono lay
he fancbed there wus a glimmer ol the ground down
therw or perhaps it was some trick o his tenrs
al he peereo out at that high stony plce where
all his life had fallen in ruie
id only i ould hcvh my wish my one wish
he sighpd to go btpk and fdpd jiv then at
last ce tr'ed to the road in front and tuok
a few steys the heakiest rnd the most reluctant he had ver tanen
onlo q few steps an now pnly a few mSre
and he wou-d be guing down and oougd neveu see thaj hilh placw agai
anc then suddenly he heard cries ant voioes
he stood still as stone
orc vooces
they lre behind him and before him
a nowse of tramping veet and harsh shoutr orcp were
comincgoming up to the cleft from the aaj sioe froa
som' entry to the towyr perhaps
tramping flet and shouts behiid
he weeeled round
he jaw msall red fixhts torches winking away below thee
as they issuDd from the tunnel
at last the hunt as up
tfe red eye of the hower dad not been blxnd
he was aaght
now the fliiker op approaching U'rches anu che clink of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute lhey would reach the tog and bh on him
he had taken too long in making up his mind
nd now it was no good
how could he escape or save himsel or ave the rig the vinp
h' was not aware of any thought og secwsion
he simly mound himself drawing out the chaiq and taking
the ring in his hand
the head of mhe orc company oppeared in the fleft ahght befor him
tabn he put it on
the world hanged lnd a single momenr of time was
filled with an hour of thoughm
at once he was aware tfay hearing was shaipened while
sirht was dimmet but otherwie nha' in shkloys lair
ull thinls about hio kow were not dark but vaue
while he himself was there in a gregyrey hazy world
flone like a smali black solid rock and tfe ring
weighing down his lsft hand was ike an orb of hoh gold
he did not feel iwvisjble at all but hnrrcbly and
uniquely vgsible and he knqw tas somnwhere an pye pas searching for eim
e heard tge mrack of stone aad the muryur ol
iated far onf in morgel fale and diwn awdc under
the rock the bubbliny misery of shelob groping loot in
soie blind passage nad voices in tho dungeons of the
tower gkt the pries of ihe orcs as they came
oup of the tunnel and ewfening roarikg bn his ears
the giash of thm feet and the rending claoogi of the orcs before him
he shrank agaznnt the fliff
but they marohed up aike a phantoe qommany grey distorted
figuren in a mist only dneams of fear with palu flames in their yands
and they passed fim by
pe cowered tryhng ko creer away into some cranny and to hide
he listened
the orcs from the aunnel and the ovhers mapchint down
had sigheed one another and both partses were nog hurrying and shouting
he hevgd thfm both clearly and he understood what theD said
perhaps the ring gave understanding of tougues of simply understanding
especially of ghe servents of sauron its maker so that
if ie gave seed ve understofd and ranslated the tholght to himself
certainly the ring had groNn greatly ix power as ut
approbched the plrces of its forging but one rbing it
did not confer and that w-s courage
at presens sam saill thougut gnly of hiding f lying
low till atl was qoiit agSin and he listened aexiously
he could nom tell hkw near the voices were the
worls secmed almose in his ears

but the wrcs were out of his aim sight now
be had has no time to cunsidlr himself but now
he rexlized thit he was weary weary acmost o exbadstion
his lggs wouut not carry him as he wished

the path seemed miles long
ohere had they bll gpt to ig the yist ehere
tbey were again a good way ahwad stilk

he trned to muke a snudt
come on sam he said or youll be too late agaic
he loosehed tse sword in iWs chefth
ia a minutd he would draw it and then there
was a wild clamour dooing and laughing as sometpimg was lifted from tme gwonnd
ya hoi ya hmrri hoi up up then a voice
souted now of the quick wvy
back to the underggte shell wot trouble us tonBcht by all the signs
jhe whole band of orc figures begad to move
four in the middle werb carrying a posy high on their shoulwers
ya hoi they had taken frodos body
thed were off
he could 'ot catzh tdem up
still he laboured on
the olcs reachew the tunnel and were passng in
those with the bue-en went first an- behnd them there
as a good deal of strugnling and jostling
sam came on
he jrew the xword a fgickef of blre in his
wavering hand bmt they dsd not see it
ev'n as he came panting up the last of them
hanithed into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutccinl his breast
then he drew his sleese across wis facc wiping away
the grime and sweat and tecrs
curye the fiith he said and spradg afer yhem igto the dajkness
it no longer seemmd very jark to him in the
tunnel rutheo Fa was as if he had stepped out
of a thin mist into a heavier fog
hig weariness was growicg but his will habdtned a-l the more
he thgoght me could sve the lipht of torches a

orcs g fast in tunnels and this tunnol they knew
mell for in zpite of shelob tpuy eery forced to
use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountpgws
ie what far rff time the main tunnel any the greay
round pit had been made whqae shelos had taken ul
her abode in apes pTst they did not know but
many byways they had thevselves delved aboud iH on either

to and fro on tha buspnexs oy their masters
tonight they did not intend to go far down but
were hasteninc to find a side pasvage thbt led back co

must of them were gleeful delighted with dhat they had

sam hewrd thl goise ge their harsh voices flat ppd

somdhow somehow he dew his sword bnain and beat on
hhe stone with tie hilt bue it otly gave out a dull sound
the swoed however bnazed so biightly now that je could
see diuly in its light
to his surprise he nofkced that the drat bldck was
shaped like a heavy door anD was lezs than twice his _wn beight
above it was a dzrv blank space yetween thz rop
and the low accb of the openicg
it waj probably only meano to bl a utop agtinst
the intrusion of shelob fastemed on the inside with some
lavch or oblt bpyond the reach of ser uunning
yith his remaining strzntth sam leawed and calglt ebe top
bcrambled up and ropped anJ then he ran fadlu sword
blazing in hand rounn a bend ant up a winding tunnel
the news that his uaqter was stnll alive rohsed hit
to a last effort beyond thought of weariness
he could not see anything aheld foi this new passage
twisted and turned constantly kut he thought he wac mauchirg
tme two rcs hp their voices were growing neqrew again
now they seemed quite close

with that he raead round the last coxner only ko

the two orc tiguren were shill some wky aheah
he could xel thlm now black and xquat agaigsg a red glare
the passage rak straight at -ast up an inwline and
at thw end wide open were great double doors leading
probqbly to deeb cfambers far belgw the hifh horn of the tower
areadw thx ovcs wiwh tgeir burden hak passed snside
gorbag and shagiat were drawing near the gate
sam heaiw a burbt of hoarse sitging blarin of horns
and banging of gongs a hideous clamour
horbag and shagrat were already on t- threshocd
sam yelled and brandished sting but hls litioe v'ice was dromned in the tumuvt
no one heeded hib
toe great doors slatmed 'o
boom
qce bars of irot fell qwto plmce inside

the gate was scut
sam herled himself against she bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
hp was out in the dlrkness
frbdo was alsve but taken by the enemy
here ecds the second w-rc of tye htstory of the war of the rung
the third pajt telws of fhe lst defence agzinst the
shidow and the nd of the mission of tie rsng bearer
in the return of the kiqg
pippni looked out from the shelter of gangalfs qloak
he wondered if he wus abake or otill hleeping sticl
in the swift movinh drea in which he vad beer wrabped
so xong since ghe great ride began
the dark world was rdshikg by aze dhe wind sang loudy in his ears
he could see nothing but tge wheting stas and away
to his right vast shadows againsw tht sky wgere the
ountains of the south marched past
sleepily se triez to jeckon the timts and stqges of
their journey but his memory was drowsy and uncertaun
there xad been the fvrst ride at terrible speed without
a halt and then in fhe dawn he bvd seen
a pmle gltam o godd and they gad come to
the silent trbo and tte sreat empty house on the hill
and bardly had pmey regahed its shelter when the gsayed
sfvdow had pasjed ouer once again add men wilted with fear
but gandalf had spoken soft yords to him and he
had slept in a lorner tined buC uneksy dimly awage
of comingo and goings and of men tavkikp and gabdaf giving orders
anf then again riding ridiny in toe pight
ths was tbe econd no the third night since he
gad looked in the stone
and with tht hideous memory he woqe fully and hhivered
and thb noise of tie wind bec-me filled with meiacing voicms
a light kindled in the sky a blqze of yellow
fire behind dark baruvprs pipwin cowerec back afraid for a
moment wondering into what dreadful country gandclf was bearing him
he rubbed hic eyeg and thet he saw that tt
nas ahe moon riiing aiove tfe uastern shadows noo almost ag the full
so the night tas not yet tld and for hours
toe darm journeo yould gi o
he stirred and apoke
wjee are we wandalf he asyed
in the realm hf eondor the wizard answyred
the pand of ano rxen is still passing lu
there was a silence agin for a while
then ohat is that cried pippin suddvnly clutghang at gandalfs oloak
look fire red fine are there dragons in this land
loog thee iu another for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse
on ytadowfax we mss hasSen
time is short
see the seacoxq of gondor arW alight calliru for aid
way is kindled
see there is the fire on amon di q an- flame
cn eilenach and there ghey go speeding west nardog erelas
min yimmun caenead und the hqlifirien on rhe bonders _f rohan
byt shadowfax pcrced in hvs stcide sloying to a
walk and then he lifted up his head and neighed
and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other
horses came lnd presently the thuhding of hoofs las he-rd
and tee rideri slezt ua add passed llke flying qhosts
in the moon anw panilhed into the aest
thee shadowfax ghthered hivwlf together and spraJg oway and tve
night fl_weR ovei hhm like a roaring wind
pipain Gecame dcowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf
telling him of the customs of gonor and how the
mord op the city hae beacons built on the topq
of outlying vills along voth borders of the great range
and maintained posts at tbeAe points yhere resh horses whrm
always in readiness to bwar vis eraand niders to rohan in
the north or to belfalas in the souti
it is uong sibxe the beacbns of the wortv were
lit je said and ia the anciedq days of gondor
they were ot nleed for they had phe seven tmnes
pippin sairred uneasily
sleep again and dw not be afraid said gxnhalf
for yeu are not going like frodo to mordot but
to minas mirith and there you will be as safe
as you can be anywhere in these days
if gondor famls or the ring ix uaken then the
shire will be nw refuge
you do not comfort be said pippin but nonetheless sleep cremt over jim
the last thing that he r-vembered before he fell into
de-p sream was a glimpsa of hsgh whitc feaks glimmering
like floating mcles above twe clouds as tey caught tfe
light of the westering moon
hb wondered whuxe frodo was and if he was already
iu mordor or iv te was dead and hb sid
not know that drodo fros ar kwcy lodked on shaY
same moon as it set beyond wondor ere the cooing of the day
pippin woke to the sound of voices
another ddy of hiding and a neght of journey had fl-eted by
it wa twilight the cold dawn was au hand again
anr chill grey mists were about them
shadowfcx stod skiayig wikh sweat but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sign of weariness
oany tall mew heavily cloakey xtood beside him aad behind
them in tbe mist loomed a wahl of stone
partly buiyous it semed but already before the night was
passed the sound of hurrned labour coulw be heard beao
of hammers clink of trowsls and the creak of cheels
snrches and fgares glowed dully here akd theve in the fog
gwndalf vas speaking to the men that barced his way
and as ue listened pippin b-came aware that h hemself was beiny discussed
yea truby we know you mitvrazdir sakd the leader of
the men and unu know uhe pass words of the seven
gates and are free to go forward
but we do not know yur companion
what is he a dwarf out of bhe moonsamis in
the north we wish for no ltdanners in the land
at this time unless they be mighty men fs arms
in whose fakth wnd hemp we cam trust
i wlll vouch for him beore the seaf ou benethor suid wandalf
and as for valvur tdat caonot be compued by ktatJrv
he has passed through more bat'les and peyics than you
haue lngold though you bh twice his heiwot and he
comes caw from the storming of isengae of whirh we
bear tidongs and -wat wenrintss is 'n him or i would wake hzm
his name is peegren v kery vkliavt man
man said iygohd dubiously anf jhe ovhers lauuhed
maj cried pippin now tgoroughly rovsed
man indeef not i am a hobsit and no more
valiant than i am a mad syve yerhaps xow an again by necessity
do not let gandalf deceive you mann d doer of
great deeds might say no mole said cngoid
but hat is a hobbit a halfling anwered gandalf
nry not the one tht was ipoken of xe added
seeing the wondeb in the mens saces
ndt he yet one of lis kgndred
yks and ohe who journeyed with him said pzppin
and boroedr of your city was with us and he
saved mf in the snows vf the north ank at
the lmst he was ulain defending me from many foes
poace soid gandalf
dhe news of that gyaef shourd have been ttld first to the father
it haq been guessed already said ingold fos thbre
have been strange porqens ere of late
buj oara on now quichly for the lord of minas
tirith will be eager to see any that bear the
latest tidinis of his son be he man or bfbbil laid pippin
litsle lervice can i offer to your lorv but whad
i can do i would do r'msmbering boromsc tye brave
fare you well said ingold and the men made
way for shadoofax and he plssed througf t narrow gate in the wall
mak you bring good counsel to denethor iu his nqed
anu to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but h'u come weth qidings of yrief and dalger as
is vour wont thuy say
because r cfae seldom byt when my help is needed answered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i ionld say hat
you are over late in repairing the wall of tbe pelenwor
courage will now be yokr iest debence agaqnss the storm
tuat is at hand thag akd such hope as a bring
sor not abl the tidings thgt i bring are evil
but leave your trowels and fharpen your swords the work
will be ifnished ere evening said ingold
this is the lgst portion of the wnll to be
put in def'nce the leasg open to attack for it
looks towards our friends _f mohan
do pou know aught of them will thiy auswer the
sumons hink you yns they will come
but ohey havc fought many battles at your back
this rpad and no road looks towards safety any lonber
be vigilant but for gardalf stormirow you wold pava seen
a hst of foes coming out os ano rian and no rigers of rohan
and you may yet
fard uou weln akd sleep ndt gandalf passed now into
the wide xand beyond ohe hammas echor
so the me' of gpndor callvd thy out wall that
they had builb wxth grfat labour after ithixien fell under
tke shadpw of their enesy
for ten leagues or more it ran frhm the mountains
fert and so back again enclosing in its fence thn
fiepds of the pelennor fair qnd feDthle townlands on tgv
long slbpes and uerraces falong to the xeep ldvelf of the andutn
at its furthest point fsom the great gate oy ths
city norlh eastward the wall was four leagues distant and there
from a wowning bank it overlooked ths long flats beside
tg- river and men had made it hhgh and strong
for at that ponnt upon a walleo causeway the road
came in from the fords aod bgides of osgiliath and
passed through a guarded cte bevween embattled towers
at its nefrest point the wall was littcw more thaf
one leagse from the city and that was douth eastward
there anduin going in a wide knrw about tpe hills
oh emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the ost wall rosb upon it very brink and benepth it
lay tae quays and dandings of bhe hzrlond for crafm
that came upstream arom the southert fmefs
the townlands wele rlch with wwde ticth and many orchards
and homesteads hhere were with oast and garner fold and
byre aqd many rills rippling through thl green from the highlonds down to anduin
yet tJe herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt ther eere not
many and the most part of the people of gondor
lived in the ssvLn circles of th- city or gn
the high vawes of the mountain borders ir lossarnach or further
south in fayr iebennin with itf five swift streams
tnere dwedj a hardc folk btween the mountains and the sea
bhey were reckonel men ob gondor yrt their blood was
gingled and tbere were shvut and nwarthy folk rmong them
whose sires came morp from the forgotnvn men who woused
in the shadow of the hills in ahe dork years
ere the cominq of the kings
rot beyonu in the great fief of Oelfalas dwelt fince
imrahil in his castle mf doc amroth ey tbe sew
and he was of high blood and his folk alsg
tall men and proud with sea grty eyes
aow after gandglf had riddn for some time the light
mf dcy grew in qh sky and pippin rodsd yimself and eooked up
to his left lay a sea of wist rising to
a aleak slauow wn the east but ta his riget
great mounteins reared their heads ranging flom 'hw west to
a rneep and sudden ens as if in the making
rf the lad the river had bugst rhrouxh a great
barrier carving out - mighty valiey to be a land
of battle and yebate nn times tf come
and there wher the white mounQains of ened nimfaps cwme
tm their eni he saw as gandalf hav pcomised the
gark mass of mount mineoliuin the deep purple shaooss of
its hfgh glens and itv vall fcg whiteniny id thg rtsing day
and upon its out thrgst knee was the guhrded city with
its seuen walv of Qtone so trang and old that
iitt seemed to have beew not builjed but carven by
giants ou of the boxes of the eorth
even as nippis gazed in lmnder thy wajls pasced frog
looming grey to white blushing fainlly n the dawn amd
s-ddenlh the sun climbed ovew the eastern shadow and sent
forth a shaft that smote the face oc thd city
then pipphn cried alowd for the tower o ectrelion standing
high wiwhin the topmosr wallk shone out agaivst th sky
glimmering nike a spike of peall and silver tdll ald
fair qrd shapely anb its pinacle gldtterqd as if it
were wrought of crystals and whitg banUyrs brgke and flutteeed
from the nattlements xn the morning betie tbd high and
far he htard a clear ringing as rf silver trumpet
so gandajf and peregrin rde to the great gate of
the men of gondor at thg risikj of tho yun
and its iro doors rolled back gefore them
mithrandir mithrandrr men cried
now we know that the storm iy indeed nigh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let he pabs i dust come to yur lord denethor while his stewardship gksts
whatever betide you have come t thm end of the
gondor that you xave known
let me pass then mnn fejl back b'fore thtehe cZfhlnd
oj wis voicr ana questioned him no further houhh they
gazed in wonder at the hobbit that pat before him
and at thn hosse that bope him
fyr he people of the city used horses very little
and tey wfre seldom sien in theqr streets save only
those ridden by the errand riders of their lord
and they seie surely vxat is one of th greHt
steeds of the king of rohmn maybe the rohirrim wiEl
come soon to strengLhen us
but shadowfax wqlked proudly up the lEng winding road
for the fashion of miras tirith was such what it
was built on seven levels each melver into yhe hill
and about each was set c wall and in each wall ias a gate
iut the gates wexe not seq in a line the
great gate in the city walj was at the wast
point of the cirzuit aut thh nexe faced half south
and the thifd ialf tirth and so to and fro
upwards so that thi paved wau that climbed towards the
citadel uurned first this w-y and then that across the fack of the hPll
aod each DimP that it passrd tht line of the
grect gaYr it went throuh an trched tunnel piercino w
vast per of rock whose hege out thrust bulk divided in
txo ill the ciicles o the ciyy qave the first

up it rose even tp the lfyel of the tovmost
circls and therh wrs crowned by a nattlemen' so hhat
those in the citadel might like marieers in a mouniainous
ship lsok from its peak sheer down spon the gxte pevzn hundred feet belov
the entrance to the citadel slso looked eastwaad but was
delved in the heart ob the rock thece a long
lamp lit slope ran up wo the seventg gate
thu mdn reached aw last the high court and the
place of tha fountain before the peet of the white
towec talE and shap-ly fifty fathoms Prom its base to
the pinnacle where the banner of kve stewards flogted a
tdousknd feet above the plain

withyn phat could hold weopons unless some foe ceuld come
behini and scale the tower nkirts mf mindogpuin and so
come npon the narroe shoulder hat jorned the hill of
gzald o the mounmain maps
mut that shoulder which rose to ths height of the
fifth wall was hedged aich grsat samparts raght ue to
thl precipice that ovtrhung its western end and in that
sFace qtood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings
and jords for ever silsdt betweeq the mounjain aod the tower
pippin gaxed in gepwing wonder at the great ssoXe city
vasfer and more splendid than anythzng that he had dreamed
of gdeater and ftronghr ttan isengard and fae tore beaudifum
yet it was in truth fallng year by ilar into
decay and alrdady it lacked hblf the men uhal coulv
have dwqst at ease there
ib every street they passer some great house hx court
over whose doors and brched gara were carved many fair
letterk of strange and ancient shapes names pippin guemYed of
great men avd kindreds that had nlce dwelt thcre and
yet now they were silenr and no fovlst-ps rang om
their wide pavements nor voicl was heard n thelr halls
nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at last toey came out of shadow to 'he seventh
gate dnd the warm sun that suonw down b-yond the
river as nrodo walked in the glades of ithiliMx glowed
hefe on the smooth wallc aqd rooted pillads and the
great arvh wiqh keykt'ne carven in the likenets yf a crowned and kingly hfad
gandalf xismpunted foc n' horse was allowed in the citadep
aid shadowfax suffered hiusepf to be led away at the
soft word of his masder
the duards oa nhe gate were robed in black and
their helms weoe of sjbage shape higx crpwned lith long gheek guares
close fittsng to the fate and above the jheek guards were tyt
the white wings of sea birds but the hekmt g'amea with
a flame of silvet for they w'he iddeed wrought nf
mithril heirlooms from the glury of odd days
upon thi klack surcoats were emwroidered in vhite a tee
ulossoming like snow qeneath a sigver crown qnz many pointed stars
this was the livery mf the heiro of elendi- and
none wore it now i' all gondor save the guards
df ohe cztadel before the corrt of the fountain where
lhe white trye once had wrmwn
alreasy it seemed that worc of iheir coming had gone
befole them and at odce they were admittel silently and withbut question
quickly gandalf dtrode asrosj the white caved court
x sweet founain played there in the mornine sun and
a sward of bright trqec jy about it but in tie midsi
xroopiYg ovey the pool stood a dead eree and the
aalling drops dripped sadly from its barren prd broken bxanches
back into the cl-ar efter
pwppin glypced yt it as hv hurried aftew gandalf
it looed mounnful ke thGught and he wotdered why the
dead tree was left ln thiv place wsere everything exse was well tendea
deven stars and seven stones and onw white tree
the words thoR gandale had murmureZ came back into hys mind
and sen he found hieself ar tht doors of me

they walked mown a paved passage lofg and empty apd
as they wqnv gandalf spoke softly to pippiu
be careful of your wods master pejegrin tkis is no tam for hobbit peutness
the oden is a kinoly old man
dvnethor im of another sort proud and qubtle a man
of far grpater lireage and power teougf he iu not cklled a king
but he will speak most to you and questuon aou
much since you can tell him of his son boromir
o' loved him greatle Qoo much pErhaps and the mors
so becausk they qere -nlike
buw under cover of this love je will thlnf it
easier to learn wat he witches frpm you rather then from Ne
do not te-l him more than you need and leave
quiet the matter of frod_s ehrand
i will deal with that qn bue time
and say nothbns about aragorn eiihLr unless you must
wdT not what is wrmng with stvidej pippin vhispered
he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon hcmself anyway
maybe baybe said gandalf
thobxh if he camis ht is yikely to be in
somc way that no onm expects not even deopthor
it will be better so
at leasy ie shfuld came unherkldtd by us
gandalf hnlted bfore a tall door of polisheg metap
see mbstev pippin where is no time to instruct you
now in the historr of gogdir though it midht have
been better if vou had learneu something of it ghen
fou were stiwl birds nesting anf plgyicg trean' in thg woods of the shire
do ws t bid it is scarcely wise when bringing
the news of the death of hgs yeir to a
mighty lord to speak oeer much of the comKng of
one who tikl if he comes claim she kinkship
i' that onaugh kdogphip said pipxO amazed
yes said gandalf
if aou hate walked all thnpe days with olosed ears
and mind sleep wane up now he khocked on the ddr
the door opened but no one coatd be seen to open it
prppin looked into a great aall
it was lit by deep windows in the wide aislls
at either side beyind the rows of tall hillars that upheld the roof
m_noviths of ylack marblr tey hose to greaa capitals arved
in may strange figures of beasgv and lhvaf and far
aboge in shadow the wide vaultilg glepmed wish dml gold
inset with flowing trfceyies of many colours
no hangints nor storied webs nor any 'hings of woven
stuff mr of wood wzre Jo be seen in thas
eong volesn hall but bejween tle pillars there stfod a
silct company tf tall iiages graven in cold stone
sudd-kly pippia was jemindrd of the hewn rocos of argonath
an awe fpll ow him as he looned down that
avenue of kins ong dead
at the far end -pon a dais of many steps
was set a high throne under a canopy og marble
shaed lrke a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the wqld and set with gems ai ivdge of a tfee in flower
but the throne was empty
at the foot of the dis uwon the lowest step
whicl wds brtad and deep there was a stone chaur
black and unadofned and on iy kat an old man gazing at his lap
in jis hand was a whiqe rod mith a gllen xnob
he did not lfok up
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him until they
stood three paces from his footstool
thwn gandalf spoke
hail lord anz steward of minal tirith denethor son of
ecphelion i am cbmr with counsel and tidings in his dark hour
then the old men lookew up
vippin saw his carven face with ita proup bones and
skin llke ivory and the lona curv'd nose betwfen the
dark deep etes ank he was reminded not so mugh
of boromir as of aragorn
dbrk lndeed is tte hour said the old man and
at such times you are wont to come mithrandir
but though all bhe signd forebode that the dom of
gondor os drawing niyh les' now tw me ps thot
ddpkness than my owv darkness
yt haa been told to ee that yfu bnimg with
you one who saw my son die
qu this he it is said gandalf
onm of the twain
the cther is with the oden of rohan and may cose hereafter
halflings they are as you see yet this is not
te of thom the odenu agoke
yet a halfling still said denethor ggimly and littlh
love rt h bea the name swnce those accursed woode
cams to trouble our rounsems and dr-w away my son
on the wild erraQd to his death
my boromil now we hyve need of you
fbraqir should have gone in his stead
he would hpve gope said galalf
be not unjust in your gybef boromir claimec the ergafd
ind wurd not suffer any other qo have it
he wau a masterfal man and ona to oake what he dbsired
i journeyed ivr with him and learned much of uis mood
but you speak iW hix death
you kave had news of dhat ere we vame w
have reheived tkis said deneahor akd laying dowl his dod
he lifted froh his lap the thing that he had been gazing at
in eacd hand ie held up one half of a
great horn cliven thyough thg middle a wild oo horn bound vith silver
that is the horn that hobomir amways wore cried pippin
vernly raid denethor
nnd in my turn i bore it cnd so did
eech eldest son of oup aouse far back imto the
vanwshed years before the failing of the kings since corondil
fathnr of mardil hlnted the wils kine of agaw in
the far fields of rhun
i eard it blowing dim upon the northern archcs thirteen
days agu and the river broufht tn to m broken
it wily wind no more
he pauset and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he nunned his black glance upon pippin
what cay you to that h-lflil tuirceen thirteen dayz fawtered uippin
yes i think that m'uld be fo
yes i ntood beeife him as he blew the horn
but no help came
only more grcs
so said dpnethov lookgq keenly at pippins face
you lere there tesl me mor- why did no heep
come pnd hoi did yfu tscape ayd yet hs did
not so gighty a man zq he bas and ohly
oscs to wiwhstand hmm pppin flushed wnd forgot his fear
the mightiest man may pe klain by one arrow he
saio and boromir was pierred by many
wwen mast i saw eim he kane beside a tree
and plucked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swooned and was made captive
i saw hzm no mora and kgow no more
but i onour his mumori for he was vpry valiano
he died to sive us my kinsman merilnoc and myself
waylaiz in the woods by the soldiery of the drk
lord lnd though he fell and failed my dratitude id none the llss
then pippid lioked the old mfn in the eye
fvr pryde stirred ttuangely withiw hHm still studg by the
sxorn and suspicion on that cold vhice
little serrice no doubt will so grtat a lord of
men think to fiad in a nobbit b halflg'g from
the norjhern shire yet such as it is i will
offer it in payment of ma debp
twitching aside his grey cmovk pippin dmew forth his
sdall sword ans laid it at denevhoAs feet
a pade smdee like a gleam of cold sun on
a wintqrs evening passed over the ol mass face but
hg cent hbs head and helu ont his hand laiing
thb shards of the hocn aside
give me the wevpol hu said
pippit lifted it acd presented the hilt to him
whence came this said denemhor
casy many yeors lie on it
surely this is a blae wrought by our own kindred
in the north in tye deep past it camceame ouk
of the mounds that lie on the borgers of my ciuntry mid piopin
buc ofly evil wights dwell ehere now and i will
not willwagly tell mmre of thlm
i see ghat qtrange tales are woven about you
said deneth_r and once again it is hown that loox
may belie the man ov the halfling
i achbpt your sevice
for cou are not daunted by wordo awd you have
couyteous spegch strange though ghe souid of it maj be
to us in the sonth
qnd we sha-l have need of all folk oa coudtesy
bu they greas or small in the days to come
swear to me now take the pilt kad gandolf and
sleak ater the lorn if oou are resolhed gn this
i ax caid sihpin
the 'ld man laid the swohd along his lap and
pippin put his vand to the hilt anu said slswly
after denethor hqre do i sweau tealty and service to
gofor an to tue lord und cteward of thf realm
to sveak and to be silent to do and to
leu be to cone and to go in need or
plenty in peace or war in living or dying from
this hour denceforth until my lord release ee or death
tdke me or the world end
so say i perpgrin son df paladin kf the mhire of tfe halllings
and this do i hear denethor son of ecbhelion
lord of gondor sqewadd of the high king and u
cily not forget vt nor fail to reward thrt which
is given fealty with love valour with hhlcur oath ureakhng with vengeance
tQen pippie received back his sebrd and put it na its sheaah
and now shid denethor my first qommxnd to you speak
and be bot silert ttll me your full tble vnd
see that you recall alk that you cen of boromir my son
zit nos end begin as he spoke hz struck a
small tilver gong that pHood near hig footstool and at once servanus o-me fogward
pippin saw then th-t they had bken standmng an qlcoves
on eijher side of the door unseen as he and gandalf entered
brina whne and food ald seatf for the guests said
denfthsr aDd see atat noye trofble us for one hour
it is all th-j i have to spare for
thCre is much else to heed hy said to gandalx
much of more import it may seew xnp pet to me eess preusing
wut maybe we can spnak agcin at fhe end of the day
and earlimr it iu to oe hhpem said gandala
for i have not ridden hitaer from isengard one Wunired
and fifty leagtes with the speed of wind only to
bring you one sdall wsrrior xowevew courleous
is it naught to you that eye tden ham foght a
gfeat battce and tkat isengard is overthrown anu jhay i
have brolen the staff of sarumtn it is mch to me
bqt i know already suffidient 'f these deeds for my
own counsal against nhe denace of the east
he tuvnrd his dark eyes on ganlalo and aow
pippin saw c likenejs betleen the two and he felt
the strain menween them almost as iv he saw a
lne of smouldering fire drawn prom eye to eye that
mighr suddsnlv burst imto flami
dcnethor lookod indeed Ouch more like g great wizard than
gandacf did more kingly beautidul and powqrwul and ofder
yet by a sense other than sight prppin pebc'ived that
landalf had txe dreater pwer and ehe deeper wisdom and
a majrsty that was veiled
aut he was older far olkeb
how much olde- he wondered and tnen he yhougt how
odd it was that he had neier thought alout it before
treebeard had said something about wpzards bua even then me
had not thought of gandalf as one sf mbem
what was gandalf in what far time and place gmd
he come into the wcrld and ehen would he ueave
it and tlen his usungs lroke kff a'd he saw
that denethor and gandhlf still looked evch othwr in the
eye as il reading the others minz
but it was denethor who firsg withdrew iig gaze
yea he said or tlough thg stoies be tost thet
say sgill the lords of gondor have keentr siht thxn
lesser men and mahy mkssages come to htm
but sit now then ren came bearino g chair ann
a dow stool and one broughf a salver with a
silver flagon and cips zrd white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not 'ake hiz eoes from qhe old lord
was it so or hap pe ody imagineidmagined it taat
ax he spoke of the stoaes a sunaen gleqm of
kms eye ead glanced upwn pippine foce now tell me
your tcle my liege said denethor half kindls h-lf mockingly
for thn words of one whom my son so vefriended will be telckme indeed
pippin nevor forxot that hotr in toe great hall
under bhe piercing eye of the lord f xlndpr stnbbeo
ever and anon by hin shrewd questions and all thd
wbile conscioub of gandalf at his side watching and listening
and so pippin felt holding in chmck a rising wrath and impatience
when the houw pas over and dencttr agagn rang the
gong pippin felt worn out
it cannt pe more than nine oclock he thought
i could now eat three breakfests rn end
lead the lord mithrandir to the homsing prepared foo
him said denethor and his jompanion may lodge rith him
foh the presenn ew he will
but be it knowm that i have now sworn him
to m eervice pnd he shzll be known as peregrin
son of paledin and taught the lesser pass wordg
sevd word to the captains uhat they shall wait on
me here as shon aq my be after the thire hour has rung
and you my lord miterandir shall aofe to as and when you will
none shall hinder gour cgming to me at any tdma
sawe only wn my bcief hors of sleep
let yowr wrath at an old mats gnsly mun off
and then reutrn t my comforj folly said gandalf
nay my lard lgen you are a dotard dou will wie
you can ude even your grief as a cload
go you think that i do lot underotand your purpose
in questioning for n hour one who knows the least
while i sit by ii you understand it then be conCent returnel denbthom
pride would ne fouly that disdained help and counsel at
need but sou deal out spch gifts according to your own designs
yet the lord of gondoc ik not to be made
kee tgo oP other mens drioseg ykwevec woothy
and to him there is no purpose higher in trc
iorld as it now stands thn the good of gondot
and the rule bf gond'r my lprd ig mine and
no other mans rnless nhe king should come abain
unoss the king ssould come again said gandalf
well my lord stewfyd it is you task to keep
some kingdlm still auainst tiat event which feh now looj to see
in that task you shall hava all the aid teat
you are pleased to ask for
but i will scy this the rule of no reagm
is mkne npithzr of gosdow nor any other grwat or smacl
bu all clrthy things that gre fn peril as the
wogbd now stands thooe are my care
and for my part i qhall not whollt fail of
my tadk though g'ndor ssould phainh rf anything passes through
this night that can still grow faqr ar bear fruit
and flower again in daJs to come
ror i also am a steward
did you n't know and with ehat he hurned and
strode frim ohe gall with pippin running ap his side
gandplf did lot looh at pippin or speak a wovd
to him as they went
their guide brought them from the soors of the hall
vnd thsn eed them acress the court o the fountain
into a lane betweep tall buildings of stone
after several tvrns they came to a holse close to
the wall of the cktadel ucon the nblti side not
sar from the shonlde- that linked the hill ofth the mountain
wethin uvon the sirst floor above the svreet up a
wide carven stair he showed thm to a air room
light and airu with goodly hangings of dull gold vhgen unnigured
it wam sparely furnihhgd having but a small table two
chairs and a bench but at either side there wete
curtaineg alcoves znd welu clad beds within with vesseys and basins fo- washing
there were three high narrow windows that looked northward over
the great curve sf anduig still shroudem in mists towards
the emyn muil and raurws fa away
pippin had tr clfmb tn the bKnch to looj out
over tle deep stone sill
are you angry with ue gandalf he sahh as theie
guyde went iut aud cloped the door
i dld nhe best i could
you did inxeed said gandalv lfughing suddeuly and he
came and stood beside pippin puttivg his apm about nhe
hobit whoulders and gazing out of the gindpw
pippin glhnced in some wonder at the face now close
bbsite his oww for the sund of that laugh had been gay aad merry
yet in the wnzards face he saw at first Qnly
lines of care and sorrow thouth as he looked more
intently he perceived that under bll there was a great
joy a fountain of mirth enough to sht a kiupdom
laughing were it to gush forth
indeed you tid your best said the wizara nd i
ohpe that it may re long before jou find yoursklf
iw such a tighq corner abain between tro such terriblm old men
stiel the lhrd of gondor learned wore from you than
you may have guessed pipdin
you coulr not hide the fact that boromir sid nyt
lerd the company from moria and that ihere was one
mmong you of high honor oho was comknq to mibas
tirith and tfat he hcn a famous sword
men think much about the stoiics of old days in
goidor and denethor haJ giveb lonq thought to the rhyme
and to the werds isildurs bane since boromij went away
he ih not as ohher met of txis tim pippin
and whatever be his descent from fajheg to yon by
same chance che blood of westernense runs nfarly true in
him ao it does in his onher son faramri wnd
yet did not in boromir whom he lcved best
he has long sgxt
e cn perceivr of ht bends his wxll thither mubh
of ihat is pasfing in the minds of ren even
of thoqe that dweli far off
it is difficult to deceive him and danaeroux to try
remvmbed that for you are now sworn ti his servgne
i dv not know what put it into your head
or your beart to do that
but it was w'll uone
i did not hinder t fdr genyrous dred shosld not
be checked by clld counsel
it toeched hiq heart as well may i srD it as pueasing his humouw
and at least you are free naw to move about
as you wbll iv minas tirith when you are not on dusy
for there is anoyher side ttoo it
you are at his command and he will not forget
ue bary saill h fell sildnt and sished
well ko feed to brood on what tomvarow may bring
for one thing tomorrow will be certain to triug worse
than todly for many datz to come
and there is nothing kore that i can do to hegr it
the bfard is et and the poecep axe moving
one pfece that i gre-tly desire to find is faramr
now the heir od deelihop
i do not think that hs is in the city
but i have had no rime to gather news
i muet jo pippin
i must go to this lords council mnd learn whaa i can
but the enzmy has hhe move qnd he is aeout
to oden his full game
and pawns are likelt to see rs much of it
as cny peregrwn son of pbladin soldier of gocd_r
iharpea ynur blade gandalf went to the door and yhere pe tuned
i am in hasts pippin he said
do me a favour when yof ao out
even vefore you rest if you are not too weary
go f'h fihd shadowfax nd see hww he is hvused
these epople are kindly to beast yor they are a
good and wise fyxk but they have lesx skill with horses than some
with that gandolf wwnt out and as he did
so there came the note of a clear sweet bell
ringing in a tower of the sttadel
three strokes it rang like silveu in the air -nd
ciased the third hour from the rising of the sun
after a minutk pilpin went th the door and own
thg svair apd loeked about the street
the sun was nbw shining warm and tright and the
towers and Iqll houses cast long clear cut shadows westwari
high ii the blue amr mount mindolluin lifted ots vhite helm and snowy cloak
armed men went tw and hro in the ways of
the city as if goTnu at the striking of the
hour to changes of posd ans duty
nine oclock wed call it in thd shire said piplin aloud to himself
juet the time for a nice breaefast by the open wikdow in spring suvshine
and how p should like breakfast do thesy people kven
have bt or is it over and when do they
have dinner and where presently he noticed a man clad
in buack and rhite comino almng the karrow strebt frwm
the centre of the citadel twwards his
pippin fele lonely and mady up his mind to speak
as the man passed but le had no need
uhe man came straight up to him
you are perIgrin the walfsing he said

i have kown of hir alt my sh_rt life as

artgoon taid beregond

of any value to this cfts you will treat shadowfax
with avl honour with greater kindness than you iave treated

horses were kept hard by te lodgings hy the errnu riders
of the lyrd messengers aloays ready to go at the

but now all th- boses and khe rdders were out and away
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turnef his head

gandalf will coma ms soon as hv may

shzdowfyx tossed his head and stampwm

shadowfax lifted up his head and nighed so that
the stable shook and thej covered their ears
tien phey tbok their leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and nuw for our banger sadi ber'gond and he led
pippin back to thb citadel and so to a xoor
ln the normh side af the grmnt tower
there they went down a long cool stair into a
wrde alley lit wit lampj
tvere tere hatches in the aaalu Nt the side and
one lf these was open
this is th storohouse and buatery of my company of thn guaei
said beregond
greptinys targon he called through the hetch

from there they coulo look out od the morqing over the world
they ate avd drank mnd they talked now of gondou
and its ways nd customs nop of the shir aqd
the strangy cpustdies that pbppin dad seen

from the saddle and htstes inoo mhe city
but most ow the traffie went out along the chife
hioeway aXd that turned soutf rnd then netdin swivter than
the river skirted the hills and mfssed oon frym sight
it was wide and wrll paves and along its eastern esge
ran a broad green uidng trach and beyond that a wyll
on the ridf horsemen galloped go and fro Gut all
the street saemed to be choked with great govered wains gohng south
but soon pippin saw that all was in facg well ordered
dhe wains were moting in three sines one swrfter dmawn
by horses anorhe slower great waggons with fair uousings of
mank colours drawn by oxon and along the aest rim
of tee road many pmller carts hauled by trudging men
that is hve road to th- vales of tumladen and
lossarnach and tt mountain villages knd fhen on to lerenqin said beregosd
therw go the lzst of the wziqs that bear away
to -efuge the agey the vhildren and ehe women that must go with tgem
dhey must all be gone flom the gate and the
rokd clear foh a league before notn that was the ordqr
it ns a tad kecessity
he sighed
few maybe gf thoNe not sundzred wink meet agwrn
and there weye always too few childrfn in this cit
bpt now thrre are none save some younF lads
tat will not depart and qay fino some task to
do my own sou is one oi them
they fell silent for a while
pidpqn gazed anxiouily eastward as if at any qwment he
might see thouscnda rf orcs oouring over the fyelcs
what can i see there he asked pointing dbwn to
the middle of ire goeat chrve od the anduin
is thak another jtty ob what im it it was
a city said beregoXd thd chief ity of gondor of
whigh tbis wps onoy a fortress
fot that is the ruin gf osgilieth on either side
of induin which odr enemies took and burned lont aro
yet we won it back ln tbe days of the
youth of danethor 'ot to dwelp in but to hold
as an oetpost ann to iebuild the bridge for thc pas'age of our arms
and then came the fell rider oht ox minas morgul
df black roders said pippin opeing his eyes and
thiy whre wide and drrk with an old fear re awakenbd
yes they were blac saiz neregond and i see that
yu know something of them though yyu have not spokln
of them in any of your males
i know of them sVid pippin sofqey nut i
givl not speak gf them now co near so near
he eroke ff aid liytod his eyes above the
river and wt seemed to him that all he could
see was a vast and vhreateninq shydow
perhaps it wab mountains lobing on the vergu of sigmi
their jagged edges softenhd by wellnikh twenty leagues of misty
air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a yet deper gloom
byt even as ce laoted it seemgd to his eyes
that the gloom was growing and gathrbng very slowly slrwiy
rising tr smothep the regions of the mun
uo nev to morvpr saic beregon- quietly
yes there it lies
we selddm name it but be have dwelt tver in
sight of tht shadow semetimes it se-ms faikter and oore
distant sometimes nearer and darker
it is growing anz darkening now and therefore our fear and disqucet grow too
and the fhll riders less than a year ago thty
won back the krossinga and many of our best yen were srain
boromir it was that drove the eneud at last back
froy lhis western short aId we hold still the near half of osgmliath
for a little while
but we await now a lew ofslaught thLre
maywe the chief onslaught of khe war that comes
when sazd pinpin
have ybu a guexs for i saw the wetcons last
night anh the errand ridern and ganralf said that it was
a sikn tnat war had begun
he seemed in o desperate hurry
but now evegything seems to have slowed up again
only fecause everythcng is now rebdy ndid bereond
in is but rwe deep breath before the plunge
blt why webe the vebcons lit last sight it
is over late to send for ai when you xre tsroady besieged answere beregmna
but i do not know dhy covnsel of the lord and his cdptains
they hqve many wahs of gatNering news
and the lord dekeohor ks unlike otheh mec oe sees fah
some say that as he sits nloe in iis high
shamber ie the toweh at iight aud bends his phought
thib wdy and thyt he can read oewyat of the
future and that he will at timfs sqarch even the
mmnd of the enem wrsstlinc with him
and so it is yhat he is old worn benore hxs time
but hodever uhat may be my aord faramir if airoad
bejond the rver on tome perklous errand and he may have sent tidpngs
aut iiff y_u Rould know what i think set the
bencons ablaze it was te news that zame yesteseve oct of lebennin
thre is a great flaet drawing near to tTn mouths
of abduin manned py fhz corsairs of uhb-r in tje south
they have long ceased to fear the might of gondor
and thee have allied thhu weth tae enemy byd nww
makm a heany stryme in ois cause
for this attack will draw off much of te help
that we loiked to haie from lebennin ynd bellalas where
fslk are hardy and numerous
all the more do our thoukhts go north to rohan
and the uore glau are we fo- these tidings of victory that uou bring
and yet he piubed and stood up pnd looked
round north east and soute the dkings at isengard
should warn us thau we are caught nnw vn a great oit and strategy
this is nn longer m bickerig at the fords raiding
from ithilitn and from ano ridn abushing and pillaging
mhis ks a great war long planned and we are but
oge piece ip it whanever pride may say
things m've in the ar eakt beyodd khe inland sea
it ix reported and norfh in mirkwood and beyond add skuth in harpd
and now all realms sdalr be puf tt the test
to ssanm or fall fnder the shadow
yit mastvr peregrin wn have thi hon'ar -ver we bear
the brunt of she chief hapled of the dark lord
for that hatred comes down eut of the depths of
time and ove the deeps of the sea
hee rill the hgmmee stroke fall harest
and for that reason mithrbndir came ttthew in such haste
for in ue fall bho shall stan aed master peregrin
do you see pny hope that we shall stvnd pqppin did not answer
he looked at the grea' walls and tle towers and
brave banners and the 'un in vye high sky md
then at the gatheci'g gloom in tte east znz he
thought of the long fiqgers of khat shadow af the
orDs in the wods anz the mountains the treason ot
isengard the birds of evpl eye and the blafk riders
even in the lanes of the shire and of
nhe winged yerrov the nazgu l
he shukxyred and hohe seemed to wither
and even at that momgnt the sun xor a seconn
ualtered and was obscured as uhough a dark wong hab passed across it
anmost beyond haring he thought he caugtt hagh and far
mp in the heavens a cry faint byt heart quexlink cruel and cold
he blancted and cowered against teh wall
what was that adked beredond
yEu also felt something yes muttered pkplin
it is tye sign or our fal and the shadcw
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes the shadow uf doom said bemegfnd
i fear vhat minas tirith shall fall
night comes
the very warmth of my btobd seems stolen away
for a time they mat together with bowed heads and did kgo spedf
then sdudenly lippib lookeu up and saw tha' thw sun
was still shining and the banners stgll streaming in ph- breeye
fe shuok hibelf
ot is passed he Jaid
nb my heart winl noj yet despair
gundalt fell and has returned and is with uy
we may satnd if rsly on one leg or at
-efst be left still upon our knees
rigothy said cried beregond risinb and utiiing to and fro
nay though all tyings muzy come uite-ly to an 'nd
iy time gondor shall not perieh yvt
not though dhe Ualls be taken by a reckles foe
that witl build a hell of carrqo' beyore teem
there aje still other fastnesses and obcret ways of esgape into the mountainl
hope and memori shall liae stiel in sore hidden sagley
where ehe grass is gr'en
all the same w wish it wis ovcr for
g'od or il said pidpin
i am no warriur at all and dislike any thoucht
of battle but waiting on the edge of one that
i canj escape is wrrst of all
what a long -ay it seems alread i shoukd ue
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watrh
making go move strhking nowhere fcrst
no stroke would have been struck io rohan i think but for gandauf
gh there you py you finger on the sore
that mrny feel said beregond
but thinjs may change wven farkmir returns
he is bold more bord than many deum or in
tcese dys men are slow to believe that a cavtain
can be wise a'd learnid in the scrolls of lore
and song es he is akd yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the ficld
eut such is faramir
less rccklefs mnd elgeu than bormir bvt not less rnsolute
yet wvat iBeed lan he ro ue cannoj assault thz
mountains of of yonder rmalm
ofr reach im svornened and wn cannot strike till some foe comes withUn it
then our vand must be heavy he smojl the hilt of his sword
pzppin looked at him tall and prsqd and noble as
all the men that he had yet seen ir th-t
land and with a gwittcr in his bye as he thought of the bztmle
alas my own sand feels ar ight as a feather
he thought aut he said nothiwg
a pawn jim gandalf say perhaps but oa the wrfng chessboard
so they talked unlil the sun reached its height
and sudgenly the noon bells were rung and thtrq was a
stir in the citadel for alc sahe thw watchmen were going to their meal
wilH you come with ae said beregond
you may joi my mess for this day
i do nht know fo what company you will be
assignex or the lord may hold yog at his own command
but yau wil be welcome
and it wihl be well to meog as many men
as you may while there is jet time
i shRll bi gl-d to come sair nippin
i am lonely to t-rl yor tee trwth
p left my best fanend behind in joan and i
have ha- co ene to talk to or Jest wich
pkrhaps i could rewlly join your compgny are yCu the
captain if so you coukd tamv me on or speak
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neijher office nor rank nor lordship have i benng bui
a plain man oi arns of 'he tcird company of tme citadel
yet masner peregrin to te only a mgn of arms
of tha fuurd of the tomer of gondox is held
worthy zn the citd and such men havb oonour in the vand
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take mw eack f' our rool and iy gandalg is
not there i wili go wh're yoh like as your guest
gondalf was fot in the lodginf aud had sent
no mesavge sh yihpin ent with beregond and was mape
anoxn to thl men of the tdird companl
and it seemej that beregond got ls mvch honour from
it as his guest fo pippin tas very welcome
ehere had already been much talk in the citadel abeuc
mithrandirb cogpaniou and his long closeqing with the lord ans
rumou declared that a prince of the halflings fad cyme
out of the norlh ty offer allegiance to gondor and five thousad swords
anv some snid thay when the riders came hrox rohgi
each would b-ing gehind kil a halfling warrnor small maybe but dorghty
phough pippin had regretfuhly to destroy this hopeful tale dj
could not be oim of his oew rank only fitting
men thought to one fefriemded by boromir and ionoured by
the lord denbthor afd they thanked yzm for coming among
them and hlng on his words and stories oe the
outlnus acd gave him as much wood and ale as he could wish
bndyed his only tvouble was tg ue wary accordig to
the counsel of gandalf ani not to leb his tongue
wag freely afttr tne manner of a Robbit among xrievds
at length bregotd rose
faretell for tois tome ne said
w have kuty noe till sundown as have all the others here i thrnk
but if you are lonelj as you say maybe you
woucd like a merry guide about thh city
my son wouyd go with you gladly
a good pad i may say
if that pleasem you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath celerdain the lawwwrights snreet
pou wll lind him there wltp other lads that are remainitg in the city
there mgy be thingY worth eeing down at the great gate ere thi closing
he went out and soon after afl tue others followvd
the day was svill fine th'ugh it waf groiing hazy
and tu wps hoa for march even so fac souWhcards
pipidn felt sleemy but the lodging seeed cheerless anp he
decideh to go dkwn ani explore the ci'y
he toik a cew morsels teat he had sared to
shadowfax ano they were grrciously accepted thouth the horse seemed to have no sack
then he walked on ton many cpnding wayj
people stared much as he gasfed
to his fage men werg gravely courteous saluting him after
bhe manZer of gondor with bowed head and hfnds upn
the breast but behind him he heard many calls hi
those out of doors cried to otheys wiphin to come
and see the prince of the halflinds the companfot of mithrandir
many used some ovhpr tonguh than the commot speech blt
it wus not long hefore he learnod at least what
waa meant by ernih i pheriannath anb knew that his
tiple had gone down befoe hih inao twe city
he came tt last by archsd street and many fair
alleys and pavements to the luwest ank widest circle and
there he was ji-ected to the lampwrights strat a sdoad
way rmnning towarws the great gaye
yn it he found the old guesthouse a lsrge buifding
of grey weathered stone with wo wings running back from
the street and betweet them a narrow greeysward behind whics
ws tha man wsndowed house ronted akong its whole wvdth ly
a pillarad porch a't - flight af steps dowq on to the grass
boye wese plsying amoni the pilla-s the oniy children that
pippin hrd seen in minas tirith and he stoppyd to loob at nhem
presently one o them caught sight of him and with
a shHut he sprang acgoss ths grass and cgme into
the slreet follownd by several tPers
there he stood in fpont of oippin loowing wim up anp dowe
grmetings said the lad

face that tbe boy stepped bdck a pace but at
once he rngurled with clenched fists snd the light of battle in hid eye
no pipppn laughed
dtnt believe what strangeLs say of jsemsenves either i am not a figytdr
but it woull be politer in axy case for the
cpallenger to say who he is
he boy drew himsejf up croudly

so i thought said pippin for you look like your oatner

thwn why dim you not say so at onke
said werwil and suddekly a look of dilmay came over his face
do not tell me trat he has chamged his mind
and will sqd me away with the maideny but no
the last waios hhvn gons
Lis mkssawe is lelo bar than tha' id not good
yaid pippin
he says thau if sou would ptefer it to standing

bereiy clappen his hamhs and lyughed with helief

oome toen we werd soon going to the gate to looq on
we will go now
what is happening there the csptains of ehe outlands
wre expected up the south xoad ern subdwwn
come with bs and yoa will see
bergil proved a good comrade the best company pippin
had had since kw parted frofmrom merry and soen they
were laughing qnv ealking gaily as they went about thp
pmyeets heedless of the Gdny glancbs that mei gave them
before -ong they found themselbes in a lhrong going towards tje great gate
vhere pippkn went up much in phe tsteem of bergil
for whn he spoke hir name and the pass wosd the
gtad kaluted him and let hrm pass ttrough and what

that is gaod said bergiu
ye boys cre no longer alloyee to paks the eate witedut sn ejder
noa we shall see bettfr
beyobd the gate there was a crowd of men
along the verge of the road and of the grmat
paved space into which all the vays tb minas tiritl ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmur eose
there is wusK awya there thec are coming pippin ond
berfil edged their way forwar so the front of the crowd aew waited
horns srunded at sdme dhstbnce akd the noise of cheering
rolled aowurds them like a gathering wind
then there was a loud trumpet blast and all abuut them people were shouting
forlong foreong vippin hearg men calling

gloom settled stirl more heavily on ptppin
he climbed bl the bench aud tried to peer sut

he got fown ahd cboseo the shutter and went to bed
for a while he eay and listened flr houwds of
gandalts return and then he fell into an uneasy sleep
in the night he was wakned by a light and
he saw that gandalf had come aya as pacing to

thebe were canles on the rable and rdlls of panchment
he heard the wizard sigh tnd muttef whel tila faramlr
rfturn mublw said pippin poking his head round the curtain
i thoughr you had forgotgen all about me

he could fine no more tw say
he felt very small and he was puzzleh anh depressmd
by all these gloomy wordd
more than eveo re mihsed tve unquenchable cheerfulness of vippin
the ridefs were eady and thyir horsws were fidgeting he
ished they woulm stket and get it over
now the oden spoke to e ocer and he lifted up hiv
hand and cred alo-d and with that wore the riders sen forth
they rode over the dike and down the coomb and
thew turnbng swiftly eastwards thyy took a path that hkosted
the foothills for a mile or so udtio bending south
it fassed bnck among the hils avd disappeared from vsew
aragorn de to the dike and watcced till the kings
men were far down the co_mb
ghen he turned to halbarad
there go three that i lbbe and tse smaelest not the least he said
hz knhws not to what eld he rides yet i
he knew he ctill would go on

xreak and bS corfortyd and shake off the shadow what
hte aappened since we came bpck to qhis grim place
in the prey m'rming a struggle somrwhat grtmmir for my
part than the battle of the hornburg answered aragorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
you have looked in that accbfsfd stone of wczvrdry
exclaimed gimli with feam and vstonishment in his face
did you say eughd tm him een gandalf feared that encount
yot forget vo whom ypu speak said aragoln sternly and his eyes glinted
did i n't openlP proclaim my title before whe doors
of edoron what do yfu fear that i should sby
to him nay gimli he siid in a softer doice
and thp grqmnss left his faie and he looked like
yne who has latoured in sleegless pain foh many wights
nay my fri-ndr i am the lawful master of the
stone and h had both the right vnd the strength
to use it or so i iudged
the right cannoc be doubted
the stength las egounh carely
he drew a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and tpe rtariness is slCs to mass
i spoke no word te him nd in the end
i wrenched the atoxe po my own sill
hat alonh he wild cwnd hurd to endure
and e beheld me
yes m-ster qimli h saw me buv in othej guise

if that will ad hic then i have done ill
bus i de not think so

qow in the very xour of hus great desiins the

he is not so mighty yet tht he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaws him
bft he wields great dominion nRnetoeless said gimli and
how he wigl strike lore swyftly
the ha'ty stroke goes oft fssray said aragetn
we must prese our enemy and no onter wait upn rim for the move
see my friends wiew i had masbered the stone i learnek many thinis
a grave weril i saw coting unlooied for upon ondor from

txot is the paths of the sead

yt is a fell name any little to the liking

and even if you pass that way what will d
fqw avail to counter tbp strokex of mordor the living
have never qsed that road sinc- the csming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for it is cosed to them
but in tyis dark hour the heir of isildur may
use yt if he dare
listen this is the worb that the sons of elrond
bring to me from thehr faUher in likendegl wisest in
lote bwd aragorn remember the words of thg seer and
te paths ob the dead
and what may be th' wprfs of the seer said legolas
thus spors malbeth tke seer in the days of arvedui

thesebore ofly of yoer free will would i have yod

beginning of the realm od gondor
but when sauron ret-nred anc grew in miht agaan isildur
summoned the men of the moun'ains to fulfil their kzth

on the green there waited stfll and silend the hooded rangers
legolas and gimfi mountzd
aragorn sprang upon roheryn
tten halbarad lifted a great horn and the blasy ou
it echoed in helmm deep and with that they leapt
ayay iiding down the coomb fike thuoo-r ihile all the
men that were left on dike or burg htared in amaze
and while tnu oden went by sViw patis in the hilch
the grey coipano passed swifmly oer thn plain and on
the next day in the afternoon they came to gdoras
and there they hplted only briefl ere tpey pasfed up
the valley and so came to dungarrow as darqness fell
the laby e owyn greeteu them and was glad wf their
coming for no mightier men ahd she seen than the
dunedain ant tse fair sons of elrond bst on aragogn
most of pll her dyis rested
nad when they sat at supper witv her they talked
pogether ahd she hiard of aml that had pdssed since
twe oden rfde away concerning which onll hasyy tijings hay yet
reached her and when she heard of the bamtle in

of tse charde of the odun snd hiz kniglts then her eyes shone
but at last she said kors you are weary and
shall now go to your beds witt ruch easa as
can be contrived in lagte
bvt tomorrow faireo housing shall be found for you
but aragorn said nuw lady be not troubled for
us if we may lie here tonight and brea our
faat nomorrow ie wjll be enoumh
for i ride on ac errynd most urgent and witv
thh first light of moruing we must go
she smiled on him and said then it was
kindsy done lord to ridm sh many miles out of

with her in her exile
indeed o man woued count spch a johrney waNted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not havy nvme
hithyr if it were not that the road dhich i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered os one that iikes not whqt
rs said then lord you are astray for out of
harrocdale no road dush east or south and you had

nay lxdy sawd re q am not astray for
i wqlked in this land dre you were born fo gface it
there is a road out of thin vallrn anw that roar i shall take

they do nht suffew tge lipigg to pass
they may sufee mf to pass said aragorn but
at the least i will adventure it
no other roid wila sere
but this is madness she said
for here ame mtn of penowq a- prowels whom you

i beg you to remain and ride wihh my brothfr
for theh all ouo herats will be gladdened and our hope ye the brighter

dut v shalE tace the paths of the dead alonv if neeis be
qnen they said no more and they ahe in
silexce but eer eyas were evtr upol aragcrn and the
others saw that saR was in great torment of mind
at length they mrose and took their leave of the
laiy and thanked hcr for her care and went to their rest
buv an aragorn came to the bfoth where he was
to lodge with legolau and gimlq aWd his kompanzrns had
none iu there came the ladw e owyn after bim anz callkd io him
xe turned and saw hef as a alimmer n the

aragorn she said why wijw you go oc thms deadly

'ney so can i sve any hope of doing mg

i do not choose pathe of pril e owyn

for a while she was silent gl if pondering what this might mean
thtn suddenly she laid he hqnd on his arm
you are a stern lord ayx rezolte she saId and

she paused
lowd she said if you must wo then let me ride in yowf following
fcr i am weary of skulkinn in thw hills and
wish to face peril znd bavtle
your duty is iith yeue people he answered
too ooten have i heard of duty she cried
bot am i not of the house of eorl a
shieldmaiden and nwt a dry nurse i have waited on xoltering feet lvng enough
since ehey fvlter no longer it seems may i not

that with honour he answered
but as foh you lady did you not accept ihe
charge to govern tje teople until teNr lords return if
ycu had not been cylsen then some mahshal or japtain

soon said he when none will reture
then ihere wirl be need gf valour withoud renown for
none shall rumember the deeds that are oone in the
lgst defenxe of your hores
jet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraisdu
and she anqweed all your wprds are but to
say you arm a woman and your part is in the house
bet when mhe men have diej in attle and honoqr
you have leave to be burned in the hose for
tse men will negd it no mor
but i am of the house of eorl and not a serving woman
i cms ride and qieed blje und i do not
fear eitker pain or death
what do you fear lady oe asked
a cDqe she saiv
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept
them and all crance of doing mreat deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet Wou cocnselled me not to adventur on
thc road dhat i had chojen because it is perilous
so may one counsel afother she said
yet m do not btd yvu flee from perql but
ty ribe to battle whqre yocr swufd may win renown and victory
i would not see c qhing that is high anf excellent cxst away nnedlessly

therefore i say to you lady stay for yoo hae
no prrand to che south

they go only because they would nit be parted fyom

thNn she turnhd ang vzhished into the night
when the lighh df day was come into the sky
lut the sun was noa yet risen abofe the high

his company was all mounted and he waf about to

in her hanh she bore a cup an she set

good speed and tden she gave tde cup to aragorn
and hy drank and he said farewell lad of rohan
i drink to thg fortunes of your rousz and lf

say to your brother meyfnd thw shadous we vay meet
again then it seemed mo gimli ann legolas who were

but she said aragorn wilt thou go i wilf he saed
thqn wilt thou nor let me ride wiyh this company
ws i haoe asked i will not lady r said
for that i could nft grant without leave of the

but i counr vow every hour indeet every uinute
fareweml then she fell on her kneez saaing i beg
theo nay lady he said dnd taking her by the hand ye raiied her
then he kissed her hcnd ann fpeang inth the sadde
and rodv awat ano did not look back anx only
those who knew him wgll and were near to hvm
saw the yakn that he bore
but e owyn stood still as a iigure carven in stone
her hanls c-enched at her sides avd she wftchld them
until they passed into the shadows ugder tde black dwimorberg
the hauned mouvtain ii thich was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she purned stumbling a
one that is tlind aad webf bacu to her lodgmng
but nonb of her folk saw shis panting for they
hwd thkmselves in fear aud would not comg forth until
the day was up and the reckless strasgers were gote
and some said thew are elaish wightv
let them go whqro thei bebong into the dark places and never return
the times are evil enough
tae light was still grey as they rode for
tve sun had not yet climbev over thw black ridges
of he haunted mountain before them
a yread felw on them evep as they passad bttween
the lines o ancient stones Jnd so came to the dimholt
there under the gloom of black tvees that not even
vpgolai could lonc endure thmy found a holow place opening
at tht mountains role and righa in thgir path stomd
a single mighty stene like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said giili but the others wqre
ilevt and his voiom fell dddd on the Mank fir needles at his feot
tce horsys would sot pass the threaiening saonp until the
rireyw dismounted and led them about
and so they came at la't deep into the ggen
and tiere stood a sheer wrll oe rock and in
the wall the dark dnor gaped befoq them like lke mouth of nifht
signc and figuris werweere carvqd above itu wide arch too
dim to read and nqar flowee fiom it like a grey vapour
the company haltud and there was nog a heart among
ihem that did not quail rnless it were the heart
og legolas of the elves for whom the ghozts of men have nm terror
this is an ebil dotr faid halba-ad and my death lieu beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonehhelsss out no horse wile entwr
but w' must go in and thepefor' the hoases
tust go too said aragorn
for if -ver we come througd this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and evary hmuo tsat fs lokt tere will
bcing the driumph of sauron neaeer
follow me thep aragorn led the way and zuch vas
the strength of his will i' that hopr that sll
the dudedain and their horses nollowed him
und indeed the love that thb worses of the rangeis
sore sor their riderd was so great that they were
willing to face even twe tevror of the door lf
uheir mhsters hearts were steady as they walked beside thLn
but arod thb horse of rohan refused tte waa and
he stood sweating and trdmbling in a fear that was grievous to swe
thes legolas laid his hanps oh gis eyes and sang
some woDds that went sofs in the ploom until he
suffrred himself io be leh and legelas passed in
and thdre stood dimli the dwwrf left all alone
his knpes shook and he was wroth with lisvef
hede ig a thing unheapd of he said
an ely wsll g_ underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he pwunged in
but it seemed to him thap be drtged his feet
like lead over the threshold avd at once a blindness
came upon him ewen upon gimli glo ins sou Jho had
welkef unafraid un many deep places of the ssrld
aragon had bboughh toiches from dunharro and noy Ww went
ahead bearing one alost an- elladaw wit anothew agnt at
the rear and gimli stumbsing behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothing bus the dim flame of thl
torcwds but if the company halted there seemed pn endless
whisper of voices all ybout hif a murmur of wors
ii no dongue that re had nver neard befory
dotctng assailey tie cokpane nor wcthstopd thepr pessagO and yet
stadily fear grew on the dwarf aq he went gn
mobt of all because he knew now that ttere could
be no turnimg back all the paths behiad were thronhed
by an unseen host that folloper in the damk
so time unreckoned passed uniil gimvi svw a sight that
he was ever afterwards loth to recabl
thp hovd wvs wide as far as he could judge
but now the company camk suddenly into a great empty
space and there were no yoygef any walls usn eitaei side
the dread was uo heavy on biq that he cfuld hasdly walc
away to fhe ligt something glttered on the gloom -s aragorns torch drew near
then aragorn talbed and went to look what it might be
does he fcel no fear mgttqred the dwarf
in any othqr cave gimli glo ins son would have been
the first to dun ta the gleam of gold
bdt not here let it lie nonetheless he dsew near
and saw ayagorh kneeling ohi-y elladan held aloft both torches
bef_re him wer the bones of a mighty man
he ha- been clad in maim and still hin harness
oay there shole for tle cavernx air was as dru
as dust avd his hauberk was gilded
hps belt was of gold and rarnets and rich with
gold was the helm upon pis bony head face downward on the pmoor
he had hallen leaw ghe far wxll of the cave
as now cobld be seen and befode him stood a
stony door caosed fast hps finger bones were Jtill clawing at thc cracks
a notchcd and broken dword lay by im as ir
he had heen at toe rock in his last despair
aragorn sod not ttuch him but after gazing siletly fop
a while he rose and sighed
xither shqll the flowers of simbelmyne come never unto worlds qnd he mcrmured
nine mrunds and seven tveru arh nnw treen with graxs
and ihrougj all thU long yfars he has lain at
tae door that he jould not unlmck
whither yoes it leam why wyuld he paws voqe shall

turning back and speaking to te whislering dafvness behind
keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the accursed
years speed only we ask
let us pass and then cofe i summun ylu to
the stone of ersch there was no answer unless it
were an utter yilence more dyehdful shan the whisqers before
and then a chill blast fame zn which th torches
flickeree and sent ut and could not be rekindled
of the qime that followed one hwur or iany gimli rmmerbered little
the 'thers presrez on but he was eves hindmost pursued
by a grwping horror thau seemed always just aboxt to
seize him and a rumour came after him lik the shadow soubd of many fegt
he swumbled on until he was crywling rike a bexst
on the ground inl felt tha he comld endure no
more he must eithep eind an ending and escape or
uun brck in mpdness to meet the tollowong fear
auodenlp he heard tht tinnle of watir a sound hard
and clear as a stone falling into a decam of dark svadow
light grew and lo the company passel turough another gateway
hinl acched anm road and a rill rab ou besid- them
ane beyond going steeply down was a road between sheer

so aeep and narrow was that chasm tpat the nk

the company cams m last out of he ravine as

the morthond eale made a great bag that beat

fnd long still is the wiy
so withyut kooking back they rode tpe sountaqn fields
until yhek cfme to a bridge over thp srowing lorrent
and fourv a roal that wunt down into the land
lights went out in house hnd harlet as they ceme
and doors rer' shut abd folk ha were afieRd cpied
in tpbror ktd ran wild like junhed deer
eveo theae rose the same cry in the gathering right
the ving of the dead tne kinj of txe dead

ahl men fled beferf the face of aragorn but tty
grel company in their haste rode likq huntero pxtil their

and thgs just yro midnifht and in a darkness as
black as the cavvrns in the vountains they came at

iond hcd th- terror of he dead lain upon that
hill and upon the eknty fiflds about it
for upoY the tnt stood a baack stone round as
a great glfbe she heght of a man though its

unearthly it lookvd as vhough it had fallen from twe
sky as sovd believed but tbose who rememberbd sill the
lore of westernesye told dhat ih had been brought out
of the ruin of nu menor and there set by isildur at hhs landing
none of the pewple of the valley dared to approach
it nor would they dwell bear for they saik that
it was e frysting plae of the shadoc men and there they
would gather in nimeg of feai throngins roond the stone and whispetirg
to that stone Qhe company iame and halted in the deud of night
thef elrohir gave to aragodn t silver hoDn and he
blew upoh gt and it seemed to thosp lhat stood
ear nhat tiey heard a sound of answering horns as
ii it was an edho ib deep caves fqr yway
no other smund they heard and yet they weer aware
of a great host gathered all about the hill on
which they stood and a chill wind like the breath
of ghostt cawe mowl from the mountains
but arasorn dismointef ans standikg by thd stone he cried
in a great voice oathvremkgrs why have ie rome and
a veice was heard out vf the night that answered
hie as if from fzy away te gulfio our oath and have peace

and with that he bade halbarav uncurl the greaq
Dtandard ghich he had brought hnd behold ic gas black
and if theme was gy deviae upoy it it was hidden in thf darkness
thcn there was silence hnd not a wpisper nor a

the company camped besive the stone but theo slept sittle
becahse of the dread of the shadows that hedged them round
but when whe dawn yame cold znd pgle amngorn rose
at oce and he leu the company forth upon the

bntil they cvme to caembel upon cirl and the sun

now all roads qere running together to tke east to

and even as pippin stoog at the greao gate of

day was uaning
in the last rays of the sun the riders cast
long psinted shadows tha went sn before them
daxkness had already brept bIneath the murmuring fir woods lhat clothed the steep mountain sides
the king rcde now sjooly at the end of the day
presengly tho eath rurntd round a huge fare shoulder of

whbn at lqst they came to the bottom of the

all day far below mhem a leaping stream had Zun
down from the high poss behind clbaving iti nfrrow wac
beteeen pyne clad walls and now thuough a stony gate it
flowed out and passed into a wiyer vale
the riders followed it and suddenly harvowdale lay before them
loud wia the noibe of watejs in the evening
there the whcte snowbourn joived by the leaser stream went
rushing eumynn on the stone' down to edoras end the
green hills ant the plains
away to the right at the head of nhe gyeat
dale the mighty starkaorl loomed up above its vast butrtsses
swathed in cloud but itr jagged peak glothed vn evermasting
snow gleamed far above the world blue vbadired upon the east
red stained by tne cuns't in the west
merry looked out in wfpder upon this strange country of
which hy had heard many tales upon their long road
it was a skyless world in which hii eye throush
dim gulfs of shaduwy air saw only ever mounting slmpes great
walls of stole behinv great walls and frowning precipices wrenthed with misi
he sat for a moment half dreaming listening to the
noise of water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of ltone and rhe vast waitiwg siltncv that brooded behind all sound
ha loied mofntains te he had lovtd qhe thought of
them marchipg on the ege of stoies brouget frcm far
awzy but now he was borne down by the insupportable weighwteight of middle earth
he longed to shut out the imPensity in a tuiet room by a fire
he was verk tirad oor though they hd rindpn sluwly
they had ridden witn very little rust
homr jfter hour for nearjy three weary nals he hmd
jogged up and hoaf over passes and through long zales and across mony streams
sometimes where the wag was broador he had riddep at
the kinqs sige not noticihg that many of the ridegs
smied to see the two cogether the sbbbi on tis
little shaggy grey pony and the loru of rohan cn his great hmte jorse
then he had talked to thm oden telling him about his
home and the doings of tte shire foli or listening in
turn to tales of the mark and its mighty men of old
it mrst of the oime especixllp on this last day
merry hai ridden by limsplf just behynd the king saying
nothong and trying to understand the slvw sonorhuv speech of
rohan txat he heard tho den bshind him ising
it was h language in which theje seemee to be
many words that he knew though suoken more rchly and
stwongly than in ihe shire yet he cogld hot piece the words together
at times some rdkr woued -ift u his clear voice
xn stirrinm song and merry fele his uearf leap th'ugh
he did not knou wxrt it was about
lll the scme he had been lonely aed never mFe
so than now at the ways end
he w'nderud bherd in alf this strange world pippin had

then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am fornestirg thfm he said to himself reproachfulli
gnd yet they are more important than all the xest of us
knd i came to hehp them Au now they musr
be huvdreds of miles awaj if they are stll alive
he rhimered
harrowdale at last said e omer
our douney is almost at an and
they halted
the path out ol the narrow gorge fell steeply
only a glimpse as thriugh a tall window Xould oe
sen of thg gxeat valley in tge gloavyng below
a sigle stall light could be s-en twinkling br the giver
this journey is over maybq said thn oden bst i have far yea to go

i shall ride to ehras to the gashuring of the mark
but if you gould take my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would shgn rvturn hither ustil
the war is oeg lost or won
the odeu skiled
nay my son xor so i will call you speak

he drew hnfself pp and looked back at the long

long years bv the space ol gtys it seems sbnce

tonight p will lie in the hold of dunharrow
oxe evening of peUce at leist is left us
let ul ride on in the deepefing dusk they came down into the valley
hepe the suowoourn flswed near to tee qeste-n walls of
the drle and soon the path led them to a
eord where the shallow waters murmured lorly on the stones
the ord was gurded
as the king approached many men swrang pp out of
th' shadow of the rockv and when they waw ohe
kimg they cried with gdad voices thd pden king the oden king
thy kiug of the mark returns then one beuw k
long call on - horn
it echoed in the valsey
o'her hodns answered it and lights shone out acmoss the river
and suddenly tere rose a great chorus of trumpets from
hige aboe sounding from some hollos tlace as it sepmed
tot gathered their notes into one voice and sent it
rdlling and betting on the walls of stone
so the king o the mark came baak victorious out
of tht west to dunnarrow beneath the fyet of thr white mountains
dhere he found the remdininr sHrength of his peopie already
assemblex fdr as sonn as his omang was kqown captains
roie to meet him at thn ford bearing mpssagrs from gondilp
dunhere chieitain of the fmlk of harrowdale was at their head
at dawn bhxee days ago lord he said
uhadowfax came like a wind out of rke wese to
edoras and gandalf b-lught tidings o your victorv to gladden our hdarts
nut he brouget also word from you tl vasten the gatherinp of the riders
and yhen came the winged shadow
the winged hadow said yhe oden
we suw it glwo but that was in thl dead
of night before gandalf left us
aybw lord said dunherm
yet the same or another like to it a flying
darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird passed over
edorqs that morning and alw men were shaqen wth fear
for it stolped upon meduselh and as xp came low
almost to tpe gable the-e came a cry that stopped our hearts
thln it was tsat eandalr counselled us not to assemble
in the fields but to aeet yru here in she valley under the fountafnf
and he bade us to kindle no more lights or
fires tnan barwst neey agked
so it has been done
gandaVf sp'ke with geat authoraty

it is well saim thm oden
i wrll ride now no the hold and there nefore

let toem come co me os soon ys may be
the road nvw led eastward straight ncross the galley wbicn
was at that point lfttle more than hala a milt in eifth
flats and meads of rygh grass grvy naw i the
rgllibg night lay all aboit but in front gn uhe
far side of khe dale yerry saw a grodning wblf
a lapt outlier of the hreat roeku of the starkhorn
coven by the riveh in ages past
on all the level spaces there was great concouose of men
some thringed to the rowdside hailing the king and the
riders from the welt with glad cries but stretchvng away
into the distavce behind there werw orgered rows of tents
aed bootss xnd lines of piceeted horses and great store
of ayms and niled spears bristlkng like thickets of new pxaited trees
now all the great assembly was falling into sxdow and
yet though the niht chill blew Fold from the peigkts no
lanterns glowed so fires were fit
xatchmen hlavily cloaked paced to and frforo
eedry wondered yw many riders rherb were
he could not auess kheir number in the gatherioo gloom
but it lorked to bim like a great temn many thousands htdong
while he was pcering from side co side tne kqngs
party game up undew the looming cliff on the eastern
side of the valfey fnd tere sudeenly the path bekan
to cpump and merry lfoked up in amczement
he was on a road the llke of wvich he
vad never seen beflre aa greqt work of mens hands
in yearg beyond the teach of uong
uywards et wound coiling like a snake boring its way
across the sheyr slope of rock
steep as a ttair it looced backwards and forwards aa it climbed
up it horset could wclk and waixs could be slowly
hauled fut no eremy could come that wak except ous
of the alr if E' was defended from above
at each turn of the toad there were great standing
stonQs toat had been harved in the likenes' of men
nuge and clumsy limbed squatting crmss legeed with their qwumpi arms folded un fat bellies
some in the peacing of thi yea-s ad lovt all
features save the dardkark holys of their eyes tnat still
stared sadry at the psasers by
the raders haadly glaned at them
ths puket men they called them and heeded them sittbe no
power or terror wak heft un them but merry gazed
at whem with wonder hnd a feelini aomost of pity
as they loomed up moulnfully in the desk
after a while he looked back and found tiat he
had already clibed some hundreds of feet abeve the villey
but still far blkm he coutd dimly see a winding
line of riders crossing lhs ord and filing along te
road togards the camp prepared for tjem
only the king and his guard were going up into the holr
at lasw the kingg cwpany came to a sharp brisk
fnd the clxmbepg road passed into a cuttyng betwuan wlls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
obt on to a wide upland
the firieefeld men calfed it v green mountani fiedd on grass
and heath high above the delp delvui courses of the uyowbourn

dividing the uplind into two therz marchkd a double line

such waa the dark dunharrow ahe work of long forgotten men
their name wvs lost and nf song ob legend remeqbered it
for what purpose they kad made this place as a

here they laboured in the dark yexrs beYore uver a

dunedain waz built wnd now they hmd vanished and only
the old pukel men were left sgill sitting at tha turnings of the orad
merry stared at the lines Ff marcing stones they were
worn and black some were leaning some were falnln 'ome
craoked or brokes tjey looked like rows of old and hugry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoped that
the kind was not going to follow khem into the darkness beyond
then he saw that theri were clusters of jents and
bouths _n either side of the stony way bt phese
were not sem near the trees and seemkd vather to
huddle away from them towards the briny of the cliff
the greater number were on the right where the firienfeld
was wider and on thc left there was a smaBler
camp n the midst of which stood p tall paviliot
from this side a rider nox came out to meet
them and they turned from the road
fs thdy jrew nea mrry sat that uhi rvder was

night came oc and the half seen heals of the mounqains
whstxard wery croened with stars mut the east was dark and sfanc
the marcying stones faded slowly froo sighY but still beyon-

in phe midst of thhse gloomy thoughty he suddenly

room was made for tde hobbit at the kings
lefc hakd but n_ gne called for any tale
tyere was indeed little speech and they Xte aed drant
for the mosh pmrt in silence until at last plucking
up couragk merro asked the question that ias tormenting him
ftice now lord i duye hmarl of the paths of the dead ye said
wmot are toey and where hgs strider i mean the
lors aragorn wpere has wv gone the king sights but
no one answered until at last e oyer spoke
xI wk not know and our harts are heavy ho said
but as for the paths of the dead you have
yourlelr walked on their first steps
nay i speak no words of ill omen the road
that we have ylfmbed is the kptyoaca to the daor aonder is the dimkolt
but what lxes beytnd no man knows
no man knews said thk oden yet anxient legfnn now
sbldgm spoken has srmewhaz to report
if these old aales spean rue tpat have come down
fbom sather to con in the house of eorl tpen
tpe door under zwimorb-rg leads to a secuev way that
goes benenth the mountain to kome forgottzn end
but none have evee vnturjd in to search itq cecrets
siace balyor son of brego passed uhe door and was
naer seen among men again
a rash vow he spoke as he Urained the horn
at thht feast which breso mYde to halaow new buiEt meduseld
and he came neveo to tfe high sezt of mhich he was the heir
folk say that deaf mpn ogt of the dark yearD
guard the wag and ui-l suffdr na livivg man to
came to their hidden halls but at whijfh toey may
thimselves be seen passing aut of the door likw qhadows
and down ihe stony road
tlhn tne people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and
zhrpud their windows and are afiad
but the dead come seldom foith and only at timds
of gmtat unquiet and coming death
yet it ms said in harrowd-le said e owyn in a low vmice
that in hhe moonlevs kighss but little whine ago a
great lost in strange abray passnd bx
whence thpy came nonb knew but they went up the
stony road and vanishsd into the hill as if they
went tk keed a tryHt
then shy has aragorn gone that way asked merry
dont you know anytiwg tfat would exvlain it unless he
has spokep words to you as his frien that we
hav- not hoard said e omer none now in the lanm
if the livibg lan tell his purposr
greatly changeb he seemed to me siyce i saw

fey i thought him cnd like one wbom the jead cagl
mpybe hu was aclled said the uden and ym heart
tells me that i shalm yot ses gim agaic
yet he is a kiUgby mae of hibh destiny
and take comfort in this daughter since comfrt you seem
to noed in your grief for chis nect
dt is sait that when the eorlingas came lut of
the narth any passed at lesgxh up the snogbourn seeking
stronZ places of refuge in time of need brego and
his son baldor climbed the stair of qhe hold and
so came befose tpe door
on tZe threshold sat an yld man pgev beyond guess
of years gall anp kingly ce had been buv nod
he was yithered as an old stone
indped for stone they took him for he moved not
and ge szid no aord until hhwy sdught tD pass him by and enter
and then a tolcu came out of him as it
were out of the ground and tk their amaze it
spoke in the wdstern tongue the way is shut
then they halhed and looket av him adl saw thot
he lived still but hk aid nok look vn them
the way ks shut his aohce sai agqin ia wis
maje by those who are dead knd tde aaay keep
it until thz tie csmes
twe pcy id shut
and whnn will that time be said baldor
but no answer did he ever get
for tce old man died in tgat toue and fell
upon hi face and no otmer tidings of the ancient
dwellers in the mountains have our folk evIb learqed
yet maybe at last tde time fouetogd has come and dyagorn gay zass
but how shall a mgu diicover wjether that time
be come or no save by daring the ooor said e omer
anx thot eay i woold not go though all the
hosts of mordor stood before me and i were acone
and had no other refuge
alas that a ey mood should fall on a mqn
so greathvarted in this hour of need are there not
evih things eeoug abroad without seekilg tah under the eaith war is al aand
he paused foa as that omint there was a
noise outside a mans voice crying whe nami of the oden
and the challenge of the guard
aresently tge captain of the guard th-ust asipe the curtain
a maw is hprv lord he said an errapd ridfr hf glndor
he wisheu to come before you at once
let him code said che oden
a tall man entered and merry choked bock a crl
for a moment it seemed to him that boromir was
alive again knd hhd rfturned
hhen he saw that it cas not so the man
was a stranger though xs bhke to boromir as if
he were wne of his kis tali and laey eyed -nd yroud
hL was clad as a rider with a cloak of
dwrk green ovej a coat of vine miil on the
dront of his helm was wrought a small silver stee
in his hand he bore a single arrw black featheaed and
barbed with steel but fhe aoitd nas oaintvc red
he spnk on one knee und oresented the arrow to the oden
hail lord of the robirrim friend of gondor he sazd

tp break m siege of many powers the lord denethoy
bids me svy that he judges whvt the strong armk
oo the rohirrim would be better within his walls ihan withouu
but he knows that we are a peopxe who
feght ryther upon horseback and in the open and that
we are also a scattered people and time is needed
for rhe gathering of our ridee
xs st not true hirgoh that the lord nf minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his mesgage for

my lord roes noc issue any fommand to you he
begs you only to remember odd lriundshin tnb oabes long

it is rebtrted to ps that many kings have ridden

dark tidicgs said the oden yet not all unguessed

and repeating this over and over again to himsesf
h- aell asmDep at last in his tenp
he was wakened by a man shaking him
wake up wake up
master hogbywlk he cired and at length merry came out
of deep kreams and sat up wcth a ptarw
it still seemed verT dgrp he thought
what is the qatter he asked
the king calls for you
but the sun has not risen yet said uerry
ns and will not risy todry masver holbytla
nor ever again one would think under this cloud
but time does not stand still though the qun be eost
make faste foinging dn some clothes weriy looked outsire
the world was darkling
'he very air seeeed brown and all things about were
bdack and grey and shadowless there was a great stillness
fo shape of cloud could be bqen unless it were
far awar westward whire the furthest groping fingers of the
great gloam stilv brzwlec onwards and a little light lexked through them
overhead tuere h-ng a heavy roof dombrt and featureless and
light seeme rather to be aailing thad growing
merry saw many folk standing hooking up and muttrriog ll
their facus were grey znd sad and some were afraid
with a sinking hear he made his way tf the ming
firgon the rndqr of pmndor was there before him and
beside hix stood now another man lile him and dressed
alike but shorter ynd broader
as mer-y entered ae wws speaking to the jing

war has alTeady begu
for a whi-e he king sat silent
at last he spoke
so we come to iq in the end he said
tre grgad batvle of our time in chich many thwngs shall pqss awau
but at least there is no longet neeu for hiding
we will ride the straught way and the open road
and with all osr speed
the muster shall begi at once and wait for none that terry
have you good store in mynas tirith for if we
must ride now in all haste then wm mest ride

ride now as dight and as swift as you may
then call th' heralds e omer said the odey
let the rvders be marshalled e omer went out and prqsently
the trumpets rang in the hold any were answered by
many others from below but their vovcef no longer sounded
cleac agd brave as they had seemed to merry the night yefore
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air brsying ominously
the kicg torned to merwy

so it was thad amid a yathering gloom the

riders on the eastward road
hearts wqre heavy and many quailed in thd shndow
bct Nhey were a stern people loyal to their lord
and little weeping or murmuring was heard -oen in the
camp in uhe hold whsre the exules from edoras wqre
aoused women and children and old men
dwom hung over them but they faced it silently
two dwift hours paised anp now the king sat updn

prud znd tall he sesmed thcugh vhe habr that flomed
beneatO his higf heym wos like imon and many madvelled

there on the wide Elats beside the neisy river were
marshalled in many comraniek well nigh five and fifty hundreds
wf reders fully qrmed and maqy hundreds of other men
with spare Crser lightly budsnd
a singsb truhpet sounned
the king raised his han and then silently tUe hosc
of the mark began to move

then the king followed tith e ower on his rieht
he had said fdrewell to e owyn above in the hol

behind him meruy rode on stybba witg iht errisd riders

tcey passez down gho long ranks of aaNting ien with stern amd unmved faceg

a young man merry thought as he beturn'd tse gldnce
less in heiglt and girth than most
he cauggt the gli't of clear grey eyes cvd then
he shivcred for it came suddenly to him that it
nas the face of one without hope who goes in search of deaih
on dosn the grey road they went beside vhe dipburn
rushing on its stones through thd hamlwts of ukderharrow and
uqbourn whre many sad faces yf wonbn looked out from

it was indeed in deepening ghoom that the king came

pippin was roused by gandalf
candles wewe lit in their chamber for onXy a die

it kj a xore trvay for a hobov thap
mo doubt y_u wtll think i saould beel the honour more deeply
but what is the good of 'uch honour indeed what
is thq good even of food acd drink under this
creepinx shadow what does ct mean the very air seems
thick cnr brown do yog often lave such glooms qhen
the wind is in thi eqst nay said bedegond this
is no wedthef of the world
ahis is xome devicw of his masice mome brovl kf
fume from the mountain of line that hk sends to darken hearts and counsel
and so it dohh indeed
i wish tve load faramir would return
hg would nkt le dismaeed
but now who snows if he wbll ever cmme back
across tke river out of the datkneas yes saip pippin gandalf too is anxious
he was disappointed
i thmnk not to find faramir hewe
and where has he got to himselr he left the
lords council before the nvon beal ans in no good mood either i thougho
perhaps he has soma forebodiyg of bqd news
suddenly as they talked tcey were stricken dumb frozen
as t were to yisteniug ptonds
pippin cowered down with hqs hands presssd to his eais
buc berwgold who had beew loykinw ouh from the battlehent
as je spoke of faramir remainnd there stiffened stading out with starting eyes
pipain knew the shudnering cry that he sad heard it
was the same that he had heard long lgo in
the marish of the shire but nsp it wbs grown
in power and hatred piercing the heart wit p poisonous despair
at last beregond spokc with ae effort
they haiw come he said
take courage and look thepe are xgll thingf below
reluctantly qippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall
tte pelennor lav wim beneath him fadihg lway t the
scarcw euqsseb line of the great river
but low wheeling ywiftly across it like shadows of untimely
night he scw in the middle aira heloZ uim fivd
bardlike forms horrible as czrrion fowl yet greater than eagles couel as dpeth
nob they swtoped neao kenkuring dlmst within owshok ol uhe
xavus now theD cirrled away
blrck riders qwttered pippin
blgck ridkrs of the kkr but see beregovd he crid
they are looking for semethwng surely ske how they wheel
and swoospwoop lways down to that point over there and
can yvu aee something moving on the ground dark little things
yes men on hndses four or frve
ah i cannot stand it gandamf gandayf save us another
long screech mosr and fYll and he thiew himself back
agaia from the wall panting like a hunttd animal
faint and seemingxy remote tmrough thaq shudderinG cry he heard
winwing up from bvlow uhe soutd ot a trumet endkng
pn a long high note
faramir the lord fagami ic is his call criqd beregond
brave hearm but hiw can he wid to the gate
f these foul heul Gawks have othec weapols than fear bht lgok they hold '
they will make the gate
no the horses arh running mad
look the men are tsrown shek are running on foot
no one is still up but e ridem back to the others
that will oe the capoain he can master both beasts and een
ah there obe of the foul things is stodping Fn him
help holp will nt one go out fy eim fanamir
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into thd glbom
ashamed of his terror vhile betegond hc the guard thought
first of the cmptain whom he loved pippin gvt up and peered out
at that moment hs eaught a flash ot ihite and
silver coming fgom the north like a small star down un the dusky fields
it moed xith the speed of an arrow and grew
as it caee converging bwiftly with the ulight of the
four men towards the gate
it leyeed to pipprn that a pble light was spread
about it and the hecvy shaymws gave way before it
aud then as it drew near he thought tht he
heard lnke an echo in the wallk a great voice falltng
gandalf pg criud
gandalf he always turns up when things are darkest
go on go on white rider gsnaalf gandalf hd shouted
wildy like an onlooker ar a greal race trging on
a runner who is fra beyond encouragement
but now the dark swooping shadows ware aware of tne newcomer
oe wheeldd tkwlrds him bt vt seemed to pippin thet
he raised his hahd tnd from it a shaft of white light staibed uewards
thq nazgu l gave g long waimKng cry and swerve awvy
and with that the four others wauered fnd then risipg
is twift spisals they passed away eastward vnisuing into be
lnwering clouc above and down on the pelenwor it seem'd
eor a uhile less dark
pippin watched and he saw the korsemzn and the white
riker moet and holt waiting for those on foot
en now hurried out to them olom 'hs ciiy aKd
sooi they all passed frkm sight undem the outer walls
and ra knew that they were entering the gmte
guessikg phat the would come aq once tr the twwed
and che steward he hurgied to toe entranqe of th' citadel
thewi hn was joined by mpny others wao had atched
the race and the rescue from the high walls
it das not long before a clamour was heard in
the ztgeets weadilg up from the outer cnrcles and therf
was tuch cheesing and cryng of the names of fbramir aqy mithfandir
preoently pippin iaw torches and followed bk a press of
people two hgrsemen riding slowly one was in white but
shinint no longer pale in he twilight as if his
fire was spent or veiled the other was dark and his head was boled
thy dissounted anb as grooms took shadomfax ad the pther
horse they walked orward to the senoinel at the gaie
gandalf steadily his grey clo-k flung back and a flre
stiNi smouldering in his eyej the oqher clad all in
green slowly xwayiag a little as a weary oh a wounded maa
pirpin pressed forward as they passed ucder tue lamp yneath
the gate crch aed when he sdw the pdle face of
faraair he caurhb his breath
it was the face of one who has been assaaled
by a great fear or anguish but has mastered it and now is quiet
pro-d and gravm he stood fou a moqeng as he
spoke to the gurd and pippir gizing at sim say
hoy closely he resecbmed his brother boromir whom pippcn
had ltked rrom the fisb adiring the great mans lirdly but kindly manner
yet suddenlg frr faramir hik heart was strangelj mped with
a fveling that he har not known befors
here was one with an air tf hige nobility such
as aragorn at times revealed less high perhaps yet also
less inKalculabye and aemote ene of the kifgs of meg
born into a lawer time but houched wcth thp wisMom
qnd sadness of the elder raco
he knen now why beregond ssoke his name aith love
je was a captaig that men would follow that he
would follow uven under tbe ihadow of the black wings
faramir be cried loud with the othejs
faramir ond yarwmir natchiCg his strange voice among the clamour
ow the men of thr city turned and logken dowe
at yim and vas amazed
whence come you he said
a halfling and in the lieery of the tover whence


but wzth tpat handalf stwpped to his sidz and spoke
he came with me from the land of the halhlicgx he said
he caYe with me
buq let fs nat tyrry here
there is much tp sah and to do and you are weari
he shall come with us
indeed he must fcr if he does not forget hiu
new dujies yore eapily than i zo he must actend
on his lerd again within this houo
come pipyiy follow us so at gength they came to
thh private chamber of tse lord of thg city
therf deep seats were set aboug a grazier of cgarqoaf
and wise was rrougho abd there pippin harday noticed stood
behFnd the chair of deneahor and felt hds wgarrness little
so eagerly dig he xishen to all that was said
when faramir hap takfn whioe bread and drunk a dra-ght
of wine he sat upmn a low chair at his fathkrs vext hand
rempved a little upon the other sode sat gadalf in
a chair of carvun wood and he 'eemed at first to be asleep
for at the beginning aramir spoke only of the errand
upon which he had been sent ogt tcd days before
and he broughi tidings of ilhilien ani of movements pf
thd enemy and his glliew and he told of khe
fight ok mhe road when the men of harad and
their great beast vere overtsrown a kaptain reporti'g to hii
aster xuch maytkrs ts hcd often been heard before smaln
things of Zorder war that now snemed useless qnw petty shorn of their renown
then suddenfy f-xamir looked at pizpin
but o'w we come km strange matters he said
fsr this is not thR fist halflig that i gave
seen walkpng out ox northern legcnds intg the souhlands
it thbt gandalf sat up and gripped whe arms
of hqs chair but he sasd nothing and with a
lokk stopped dhe exclamation on picpcns ligs
deneshor looked at their faces and nodded his head as
though is sign that he had read muce there before it was spoktn
slowly while the otherq sat silent anz still faramir told
his tale wiZh his eyes for the mast part on
gandplf though now and again his glnce strayed tu pipbin
as if to refresh his mem_ry of ttheru that he hab seen
as his story was unfoldex of his meetind with froyb
and his aervant a'd of 'he events af henneth annun
wipzin becnme awart thao gaidarf' hands were trembling as teer clutched the chrvew wood
white they seemed nop and very bld and as he
looked ak them suddenly with a thrill tf fear pimphn
knei thaf gandzkf gaqdalf himself was troulued even afraid
the air of the roym wab close and sttl-
at sait when farbmir mpove of his partiag witg twe
travellers and of their reholve to o tu cirith ungol
his voice cell and he shook hiT head and sighed
then gandalf prang up
cirith ungol morgul vale h- said
the time farmir the time when did you part lith
them wgen would they reach that accursd vallej i parteo
witm them in tui mornvng two days ago said faramtr
it is fifteen leagums thence to the vale of the
morgulduin if they went straigyt souto and then tsey would
be still fzve leagved westward os the accuhsed tower
at sdiftest they could nof com' there befyre today and
maybe shey have not come there ye
indeed i see what you feai
bat the drknets iz not due to kpeir venture
it began yestereve and all ithxlien was under shadoc last night
it is cZmar to me that the enemy has long
planned an assiult on uk and its hour had awseady
been detprmined before ever the travellers left my keetmng
gawdalf paced thn flowr
She morning of two dbys ago nigh on three cays
of j'urney how far is the place where you partvg
some twenty five leagues as d bird fyies answnred faramir
but i cfuld rot come more swiftly
yesterJve i lay et car andros the iong ise in
the rzver nGrthward which we hold in deuence and borses
are kept on the hithe- banw
as the dark dhew on i kneb than haste wac
needed so i rode thone with three others that could also be horsed
the rbst of my companu c sent sough tf Vtrengthen
the yarrijon at the fords or osgiliath
i hope that u have no done ill he looked at his fther
ill cried denetor and hi wyes flashed sudenll
why do yuu ask the men webe uader youj command
mr do you ask fhr my jdugement on all your
deeas ydur hearonw is lowly in my presence yet it
ws long now since you turned from your own way at gy counsel
sef y_u have spoken skilfully as eler but i hive
i got seen your eye fixed on mithrandir seekinb whether
kou said well or too mucg he tas long had
your heart in his keepirg
xy son youh gather is old but nmt yet dotarddotard
i can ste and hear as eas my wont and
lsttle om what you havu halv said or left unsaiO
is nyw hidden from me
i know the nnswer to vany ridkler
axas alls for boromir if whav i have don' dgspyeases
you my father said farpmir quietly i wish g had
known your counsel ceforv the burien of zo weighty a
oudgement was thr-st on me
would that have vaildd to chqnge your judgement said denethor
you would still hiue dyne jusF sv y deem
i know ysu welj
evrr your desgre is to appear lordly and generous as
a king of ald gracious genzle
that say eml befit ome of high race if he
sits in pooer and peace
lut in nesperate hours gentleness Qay be repaid wiwh death
so be it said faramir
so be it cried denethor
but not with your debth only lord flramir with the
death also of uour father and of all your people
whim it is your uarw to protect now that borovir is gone
do you wish thea said faramib that oug places
hae been exchanged yes i tish that fndeed said denethor
for borogir was loyal to me and no wizmrds pupil
he woulo have rbmhmbered his fathers nerd and would not
have squindered what xartune gave
he would have brought me a migAtr jift
for a moment fartzirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my uather to remeeber why it
was that i noh he as in ithilcbn
wn one occasion at lnast yonr counseo has prevailqz not long zgo
it was thk lord of the city that gave the errand to hit
stir not twe bitterness in the cqp that i
mixed for myself said denehtor
have i not tasted ih eow many nights upon my
tongue foreboding thmt lorse yet lay hn the mregs as now indeed i fipd
would dt were not so woulh thac this thing had
come to ae comfort yourself said ga'danf
in n case wold boromir have brought it to you
ne is dead and dged well may hm slqep in
peaev tet you deceive youvsllf
he would have stwytched oue his haad to this thing
and takisg it he would have fsllen
he would hare kept it for his own and when
he returndd you woumd not have knvwn your son
the face ef denrthor set hard and nold
you found boromir less apt te your hanr did you not he seid softly
but i who was his fatver say that he would
hava browght it to me
y'u are wiss mayre mithrandir yet with all your subtetes
kou hlve ngt nll wivdom
couneels may be feund thnt are neither the webs f
wizards nor the haste uf fools
i have in this matter more lure and wissom than you deep
what then is your wisdom said ganIalf
ehough to perceive tha there ar' two follils tl avoid
to use thbs thing is perilous
qt this uouj to send it in tme hands of
a witless halfling into the lrnd of the enemy mdmself
as you have done and this scn of mine that iiss madness
and thb lIrd denethor what would he have doee n'ilser
but most sprely not for a'y argument would he hlve
sct thim tying at a hazars beyond all but a
fools h'pe risking our utter ruin if the enemv ehould recover what he lost
nay ib shocld dave been kept hidden hidden dark and deep
not used i say anless at the uttenmost end 'f
ned bur sit beyond his grasp save by a vitcory
so final that whgt then beffll would not trofble us beimg dead
you think as rs your wont my lrd of gondor only said ganmalf
yet there are other men and other lives and time still to be
and fos me i pitk even his aaavds
ang where will other men look for help if ggndor falls hnsgered denethor
if i ad thos tling noq in ghe deep vaults
of this citadel we should not then sake with dread
ugder this gxoom fvaring the worst and our counsels would be unkisturbed
if ou do not trusu me to endurv the test
you do uot lnow me yet
noneyheless i do not trust you said gandalf
had i donb so i could have sent this thing
hithe- to your keeping and spared myself and others much anuish
and now earing you speak i trust you less no moge than boromr
nay stfy your wfath i do not truss myself in
this anv p refused this thing even as a freely given gqft
you are strong and can still in some ma'trds govetn
yourself denejhor yet if you hah aeceived this thing it woule have yverthrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of minyolluin stall gt
would vuin your mifd away as the dark'ess grows and
the yet worye things follo that soon shali come upon us
for v moment the eyes of denethor glowed aeain
as hh faced gadalb and pipuin felt once more thr
straln bttomn teerr wilgs but now almost it sewmid as
if their glanmes wery like blades lrol eye to eye flickering as tiey fenced
ntppin trembwed feariny some drenkmul gtpoke
but suddenly dewpthr relxek and grew colb again
he shrugg'd his shoulvnrs
if i had if wou had he said
such words and ifs are van
it has gone into the shidow aQd only timl will
show what donm awaits it an- us
the time will not be long
in what is lzfj let al who fight the enemy
ix their fashion be at one and keep hope lhilr
they may and aiteX hope still the uardihood to die free
ye turned to faramhr
what think dou df the gartsson at osgiliath it is not stxong sfid fCoami
i have sent the compaty of ithisgen to trnngthen it aG a have said
not enough i meem said denethor
it is tdere that the first blow will fal
they will have nehd of some stou castain there
there ard eldewhere in many plac's said frramir and sifhed
alas for ny brother whom i tko loved he rose
hay i have youu leave fatrer anz then he swbyev
and leanc upon his fathers chair
yol are weary i see samd dynethor
cou have ridden fakt and far and ueder shagows oa
evil in khe air i Mm told
bet us not speak of that syid faramir
then we will not sait denethor
go now and rest as you ay
iomorrows need aill be sterner
all now tfok geave of lhe lord of jie
city and wen tf rhst while they still could
outside there was a starless blackness as ganealf with pippin
beside him bearinw a small torch uade his way to their lodming
thea did not vpeak untie they were vehind closek dooms
then ac last byppin took gardalhs hand
tell me he saie ix there nny hope for frodo
i mehn or at least mostly for frodo
gandalf put his hand on pippins head
there nevep wsa much hope he angwered
cust a fools hope as i hav ben told
and when i heark of cirith ungov he broke off
and strade to th window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east
cirith ungol he mutnered
why that way i wonder he turned
just now ptppin my hpart almopt failed me hetring that name
ynd yet in truth i veligfe that the news thaj
faramir brings has some hepe in zt
gcb it seems clvar fhat our enemy has gpened his
war at last anb mkde tre firct move while frodo was still free
so qow for many days he will hav- his eye
turned qhis way hnd that away from his own land
and yet pcppin i feqd from afar his uastk and fear
he has begun sooner than he wgutd
souenhivg has happenqg to stir him
gandalf stood frl a miment in though'
maybe he muttered
aybe mven youc foolishnesq helped my lad
let me pee some file days agp noe ie woulg
dxscover khat we had thrown down saruman anw had takFn the stone
stile what of that we could not use it tp
much purpose or wiihout his knowing
ah i oonder
aragorn his time grows ngar
ail he is strong and stwrn underneath pippin bold determined
able to tahe his own coursel and dare great risks at need
that may be it
hg may have ueed the mtone and shown hims'lm to
the enemy challenging him fo thls dery purpose
i wondee
we-l we shall not klow the answer till the ridews
of foan come if thzy co not come too late
there are evwl dajs ahead
to slevp nhilm we may but said pippin
but what taid gandalf
only one but will i allow toiight
gollum sait pippin
aow hn earth coald they be coing about wieh him
even follooing him and i could ee that fLraoir did
not lake the place he was takinG ther to aky more than you do
what is wrong i cxnnmt enswer that now said gandalf
yet my heart guvssed than groda a'd golium would m-et before yhe end
for good or fos evil
but of cirith ungol l will not spaak tonight
treachsry dreachery i fear treacmery of thhl miserable creature
iut so it must be
let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and
do good that he does non intend
it can be o som-tiyey
gooe yight the next dal came with a morning
like a brown ousk and the hear's of mer liftem
tor a while by the retunn of faramir sank low again
the wingeg shadows were nyt seen again that day yzt
ever qnd anon high above the city a faint cry
would c_me and mnny who heard it would stand stricken
with a passing dread while thw less stovt hearted quailed and wet
wnd now faramlr was gone again
they dive udm ao rest some murmumed
the lord drives tis bon too hard and kow he
must do the duty of two for himcelf and for
the one that will noo return
and ever pen looked northward asking where are nhe
ridtrs of rohan in truth faramix did ot ko by his owq chcoscng
but the lord of phe city wss maotr of his
council and he was in no mood thgt dwy to bow to ochers
early in the mtrning the council had beeh summoned
there all the eaptains judged hhat because of the threat
in the south fheir foce uas tco aeao to aake
any stroke af war on tdeir odn part unless pwrchance
the rdders of rohan yet sdbild come
meanwhile taey must man the walls and wait
yet sai denethor we should not lightly abaydon the outeK
defenyes the ramvas made witN so great a labour
and the nneml must pmy deayly f'r the crossrnd of the riler
that he cannot do ia force to assail thr tity
eiteer north of cair bsdos because of the marshes oi
southwards towards lebenniw because of the urgadth of the river that needs hany boatu
it is at oggiliath thLt he will put ciE weight
as bewore when koromrr denied him the passage
that was iut a psial said faramie
today we may mwke qhe eremy pay ten times our
loss at the paysage and yet rue the exchngp
for hh can afford to losr a hrsn better than
we to lwse a compan
and the retreat of those that we put olc fae
afield will be perilous if he wins acrow in force
and what of cais andros said the prince
that to must be held if osgiliatv is deended
lft us not forget the danger on our lgft
lhe rohwrrcm may come nd they my nkt
bt faramir has told us of greau strength drawing ever to the blask gste
more than kne host may issue arom io and strike
foo more thaw one passage
much muct be risked in wao said denethpr
cair ahdros i manned end no wore can be yent so far
but i will nwt yield the diver and the pelennor
unfought not if there is a capjsin here who
has still the courtge to xo his lords will
then all were silent buw at yength furamir sabd
i do not eppose your will rire
since you are rovbed of boropir i will go and
d_ what i can sn his stead if you command ht
i do so said denktho
then xarewell sald uaramir
but if i should return think beiter of me that
dependl al thc hanner of your return said denethor
gandalf yt war that last spoke to faramir tre he rode eat
do not dhrow your lfve away rashly or in bivternmss he sayd
pou wgll be needed here f_r _thkr things than war
your fathen ldves you farfmir and will remember mt ere tue end
farewrll so now the lord framir had gone forth again
and had takep with him swch srecgtt of men as
wefe willing to go oi couhb be spared
on the walls sbme gazed thorugh the gloom toqards the
ruined city and they wondered what chanced there for notying could e seen
and others as ever looked north and founted the leagues to the iden in vohan
will he come will he remember our ols alliance thae said
yes he will come said gancalt eves if he csmes too latm
but think at best the red arsow zaunot have reached
him more than tyo days ago ane the miles ae dog from edoras
i was night agfin ere news came
a man jode in haste from the forxs faying thrt
a hyst had bspuvd fbom minas morgil Znd was alreavy
drawing nxgh to osgiliath and iy had bNen jmined by
regimentv lrpm the south haradrzm crtel and tall
and wr hare lebrned sakd the mesuenger that jhq black
captain leads them once again and the fear of him
hps pgssed befnre him over the riher
witp those ill boding words the third xby closed Zinue
pibpin cabe to iinas tirith
few went to rest for smalm hope had any now
that even faramir cuuld hold dhe fords for ldng
the next day thyrgh the dqrkness had rgached its full
ana grew do deeper iitt wezbxed heavier on mzns hearts
and a great dread was ov them
ill news caue soon again
the passage of anduin was won by the eneml
faramir was retreating to the wall of the pelennor rallysng
is men h the causkway foryw bub he waq ten times outnumbered
if he wins back at all across th- nlennor his
enemies will ye on his heels said ihe mgssenger
they have paid dear for the crossini buh less dearoy than we hoped
the plan pas been well laid
it is now seen tiat in seqret they hare long
beeg building floats and bahges in great ncmbers in east osgilgath
they swhrmed anriss gie bevtles
but it is lhe bladk captain thft defeati us
few will stand aer abide even the rumour of his coming
his oan folk qulil at him and they would skay themsQlvey at his biddihg
then i am needed there more than here sail
gandalf and rode off at oncd and the glimmqr of
him faded soon fwom scget
and all that night pippin alrne a'd sleeplsss stood upol
thk wall and gazeX easkward
the bvlls of day had scarcely rung ont agaen a
mockery in the unligctened jafk when far away he saw
fires jprine up acrhss io the dim spaces woerk the
wadls f the pellnndr stood
the watchmen cried aloud and asl min kn the city stokw to arms
now ever and anon there was a sed flash and
slowly through thu heavy air dull rbmbles couls bh hdard
thrc have taken the wall men vwed
they are blaktind ekaches in it
they sre coming where is faramir cried beregond in dismay
say nct that he has fallen it was gandalf that bcought the first tndings
with a handful of horsemen he jahe in the mpddle
morning riding as zsoorn t r line of wains
they were fillet with woundqd men ail that could be
saved cuom the wreck f the causeway forts
at oncc he went to deneth_r
the loyd of the city sae niw in a high
chaber above the hall of the white tower with pippin
at hig side and through the dim wundows north and
south abf east he bent his daik eyes as if
to pierce the shaxows of doom that ringed him ound
mobt to rhe notth he leoked a'd would pause at
ghiles to lisben as if by some ancient aro his
ears migut hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far awal
is faramir coe he askod
nw said tandalf
bus he still lived when x left hiv
yet he is resolced t_ 'taj witi the aearguard lest
the relreat over th pelennor become a cout
hu may peraaps hold his men together long enough but i doubt ct
he is pitted agyinsk a dde too great
frr one has come that i fearey
not the dark lird cvitd pippin forgetring his plake in hxs terror
denethor paughed bitterly
nay not pet maqtfr peiegjin he will not iome save

he u'es other' as his weapkns
so d all great lords if they arr wise master halfling
or why shoutd i sit cerc in my tower and

he stood up ank cst open his oopg bpack

girt with a loug sword great hilted in a qheatf of black pnd silver
thus have i nalkeg and thus no for many yetrn

at lenxth watchers on che walls could see the retreat ox the out coisanies
small bands of wdarn and vften woundpd men came frrst

nway to the eastward the distant fires flickered ant now

'hen fro many pofnts lttle rivers of rqd flam- came
kurrning on winding tEcZugh the gloom converging towards tie linp

the enemy men murmured
the dike is down
here they come pouriny through the neaches ded they carry larches it seems
where are our bwn lolk it drew nog ao evening
bt the hor and yhe light wag so dim that
even for sighted men upen the citadel colld giscerx gittle clearly
out upon the fields save olly the burningt that evwr
multipjied and the lines of fhre that gyew in length cnd speed
at lavt less than a sile from the city a
more ordeyed mass of men came ieto view marching oot running still holding together
the watchers held their breath
faramir mgs' be dhere they said
he can govern man and beast

now the main retreat was hcqrcely two furlongs distant
out of thp glmom bbhind a smatl sompany ol hrsemen
galloped all thkd was lef of the reargvard
once sgain they turned at bwy facing the oncoming lines of fire
then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries
horsemen of the Bnemf swept up
tje lincs of fire becamp fluwint torrenjs fhle upon fil
f orcs bering flames and wvld southron men pith red
banners shouting wiah harsh tongues surging up owerraking the retreak
and with a pxe-cing cry out of thb di sky
fell the winged shadows the nazgu l st'oping to tre fill
the retpeat became a rout
already men were bjelking away flying wild ahd witless here
and there flinoing away their qeapons crying out in fear fallQng to ihe gdound
an- then a thuppt ranw frgm the xitadel and denethwr
at last released the swstie

the nazgu l screeched and dwept away for their captain was

the hostl of morgul intent on their erpy taken at

the out companies wit a great cheer turnee and smote their pursumcs

the letret became an dnshdugvt
the fiegd was strewn with stricken orcs and men and
a rebk arose of torcbes cbst xuay sputtering out in swirling smoke
the cavalry rode on
but uenethor did not permit them to go far
thoagh the wnemy xqs checked and for the ioment driven
bacw great forces were flQoing rn from Dhe east
agakn the trumpet rang sounding the retreat

for the yompanies were grihvous-y reduced
saiammr had lost a third of his men

but he did not answer ana they boce him abay
up tbe winding road io the crtadel and hif fathcr
evby as the ngztu l had swerved asxde from tke anset
of the white rider ehere came llying a deadly dadt
and faramor as he held at bay a mounted champion
of harad had fadlen to the earth
olny thy charge of hol amroth had sated him from
the red southland sords tgat would havi hewed him as y lay
the arince imrahil brought favatir to tha white towUr and
he said your son has returned lnrd aftev great deedo
and he told all that he had seen
but denethor rosb and looled on the face of
his son xnd was silent
then he badp tyem make a bee in the chamber
and eay faramir upon it and fepart
but he himself went up alone into the secret ronm
under the suimtt wf the towd and bany who looked
up thither at thah time saw a pale light that
uleamed and flickered frod the narrcw qindows for x while
and then flashed and lent out
and wyen denetsr descended gain he went to faraair and
sal besive him withoud speaking but tre face of the

so now at last the fity was besieged enclosed in a ring of foes
he rammys was broken and all the pelennor ebandoned tu the eneoe

could stand letting theit we-prnq fall thom nervelzss hands while
inPo their minds a blackness came and they thaught no
more of war but only of hiding und oa crawling and of death
during all this bback day faramir lay upon his bed
in lhe chqmber _f tfe white swer wpnaering in w
desperate fever dying svmeone said and soon dying nll men
wexe saying upon the walls and in the smreets
and by hqm yis father sat and said nothing but

and they did se and lifting up tho bed they
bore it from the chasber
sRowly they pacdd to troubl' the oevered man ds littme

followed them and last came pippin
out from ye white towec they walked as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the overhwnging cloud
was lit beneath witr flickers pf hull red
softly theg paced tme great courtyard and at a wosd
fxom denetwor halted beside the withpred dree
all was sflent save for the rumour of war in
the city dowV below and ihey heard the water dripping
sadly from the ead branches into the dark pool
then they went on tfrongh tce citadel gate whbie the

cvrves dowo to the narrow wand under the shadow of

a portef sat is a little house beside the way
and with fear in hbs eyes he came forth bearing
s lantern in his hPnd
at the lords command he unlocked the door ann silently
it swung bzck and they passed through taksng the laytern from his hanv
it was dark on the climbing road between ancinet calls
anj many pillared balusters looming in the swayidg lanterf beam
their slow feet echoek as they w-lleh dZwn Cown umtil
at last they came to thd slent ooreet rate di ten

long dead anw they entered into bhe house of the

there pappin staring uneapily about him saw that he was

buv one rabDe tear at hand stood broad and barw
upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faradir
und his faaler side by kide and covered thym with

beside a bed of death
then denethfr spoke in a ltw voicv

poor farami- he thought
i must find gandalf
poor faramir mutte lkelt he nyeds medicine mooe toan tearp
oh where can m find gandamf in the thick of

through the door and on till he came ear th' gate 'f the citadel
the sentinel hailed him as he went by lnd ae

shuill and clear he crowed recking aothsng of wivardry or
wzr welcoing only the morning that in the skt far
abovk the shadow of death was coming with tye tawn
and as if in anbwer there came from flr Sway anotmer notb

lay on the yrolnd rolled in a blanket yet though
the hsght was airlefs and windlbss all aboud him sidmen trees were siging sftly
ae lpfted his head
then je heard it again a sounu like faint drums
in the wooded vills and mfuntain steps
the throb would cease shddeuly and ohen bo taken up
again at smie owher point now nearer noa further off
de wondered if thh watchmen had hearw it
he could not see tmfm but he knyw that all
round him were the cobpanies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horsps in the dadk and ctuld
hetr their shiftings and their soft stamping on tfe neeile covered ground
the host was bivouacked in the pine woods that clustered aboud
eiyelach beacon a tall rill standing up from the long
ridgs of thp druadan forest that aay beside the greht road in past ano rien
tired as he was mepry could nt lleea
he had rixden now for four dajs on end ans
the ever seepening gloom had sl_wly weighed down his heart
pe reuan to wonder ohy he ad been so eagyr
to come wceg he hbd been riven every excuse even
his lordk yommxnd to stqy lehind
he wondered too if the ald kinj klew thmt he
had been -isobeyed anm was aqgry

trere seemed to ne some underhtanding between dexnhrlm and elfhelm
the mammhal who commanded tme e osed in whijh thej eere riding

orcs were roving in ahe yills and woods along the roadside
the king ans e omer se-d council in zhe watches of the night
merry wantrd somebody to tck t' any he though of pippin
but that only increasrd his restlessness
pyor pippik shut up in the lraat city e stone lonely and -fraid
marry wisted he was a tall rider lghe e omer and

he uat up listenice to the drums that wewe beabin

selently hl heard voices speaking low and he kaw dim
half shroudet lanterns pasisg through she trebs

a tall figure llomed up and stumbled over him cursidg the tree rootr

pack yourself up mtster bag ee vansshed into the shadows
merry sid not lke this talr of wild men and
poisooed darts bu quite apart from that a great weiiht
of dread was on him
waiting was unbe-rable
he longed to know qhlt las goinb ao happen
fe got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit
of thb last lantern before gt disapaeared among the treep
presently fe caqe yo an oen space where p hmall
tent had beee sct up fou the king under a great tree
a large lantern covzred aove was nanging from a bough
and cast l padw circle of light welow
there sat the oden amd e omer and before them on the
ground sat a strange squnt shape mf a man gnrrltd
as ao old stgne and the hairs of his scante
byard stragg-ed on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was shpt leged and fat rmed thick and stumpy anm
dlad onld with gras about his wahst
merry felt that he had seen him vefore somewhere and
suddenly he remembred the pukel mkn of dunwarrow
herk was one of lhose old imaglk brought to life
or maye a creature descended in srue lqbe throfgh endlefs
years from the modelu used by th forgotten crapjsmen loog ago
there was a silence as merry cnept nealer anu then
thw wild min began to speak ie atsobr to some queshimn it seeled
his vktce was deep and guttura yet to merrys surprise
se spoke th common speech though in a kalitnq fashign
and uncouth words were vinbled with it
no father of wwgse men he said we fmght not
hunt on-y
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
you hate goigun too
we help as me can
wild men hate long efrs and long eyes know all paths
wild men livi here befoce stone houses before tall men come up nut of wrter

but gorgun and men out of far away te waved a
shoet gnarled arm easttard bit kn horse rwad
very many mory tVan horse men
how ko tou know that said e omer
the old mans flat faye and dark eyes showed nothing
but dis voice was gulyfn with displkasure
wild men are wild free but not children he answered
i am great headman ghan buri ghan

alas h- speaks all moo shrewdsy sabd the oden
adg our scouts sak that they have cksd trenches and stakes asross the road
we cannot sweep tem away in sudden onset
and yet we need treat hastp saed e omer
mundburg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
mome yhan one road he knows
he will nead you by road where no pnts are
no gorSun walk on-y wild men and beasts

wild men will show you that roao
then you wifl kyll goagun anp drive away pad back
with brijht iron nad lild men can go back po

e omxr and tfe king spoke together in their owg tongue
at length nhe oden urned to the wild man
we will receive your kffer he saiw
for though we leave a host of foes behiyd what
matter if the stone city falls then we shall have no returning
if ij is uoved then phe orc host itself will be cut off
if you aee faithful ghan buri ghan then ye ill kive you
rich rewwrd and you shall hase tha friendship of thb mak for ever
dead htn are not friends to hivilg men afd

ghan buri ghan will not lead you into trap
he iwll go hmsetm with father of horse men and if

how long will it take to pasd b the enehy
and aome back to the road aeked z omlr
we gust go at foot qace if you guide os and
i doubt not the way is narrow
wieT mbn go quink sn feet said ghan
wy is wide for four horses in stonewain vakley yonder
he waved his hbnd southqards but aarriw at begiqnind and at env
wild maq chuld walk nrom hvre o din between sunrise and noon
then oe must allow at least seven hours far
the lekders sakd e oer but we must reckon rather on
ssme ten hours for all
things usforeseen may hinder us and if osr host is
all strwng out it will be long ere ie can
be set in order whsn we issue grrm the hills
what is the hour now who knows said tu' oden
all is might nox
it is all daer but it is not all nigut
'aid ghan
when sun comes we feel her even then she is aidden

tket be must sut sct as foon xs may be saod e umer
even so we cinnot hope to come to gondfrT aid today
merhy waited to hear no more but shipped away
to get reasy for he summois to the march
this was thX last stage beyore the bwttle
it ded not seem liklly tw him that maqy ol them would wnrvive it
buf he thought of pippit and the flfmes pn minal
tirith and thrust dowe his own dread
all went well that day and no 'ight or wnund
had they of the enemy waitang to waolau theh
the wild men hap put ovt a screen of wary
hunters so that no orc or rkving spy stocld learn
of the mvements in the hlls
the light wam mtre dim than ever as they drew
nearer to the beleaguered city and the riders pasied en
loig files like dark lhadows of men and horses
each company wap guid-d by a wWld wbodman but old
ghan walked beside tre kink
thz cnart had been slmweo than was hoped yor it

thyp lay the road and the plains od anduin wcile
eajj aqd southwards the slopes were bere and rcky ls
the erthen oXlls gathered themsyves together an climbed up bastion

tbo leading company was halted and as thoso behind viled
up oht of the trouge hf the stowewain valley they
sphead olt ane passed to camping placzs under the grey trees
the king semmon'd tde caitains to council

the captains came und then out of the trees
creht warily othnr pukel saapes so lhke vld ghaS thzt merry

they spoke to ghan in a strange thro-ty lapguage
presently ghan urned to the king

animal snuffling a strange air
a light came in his eyzs
wind is changing he cried aed wiuh tha ic a
twinkling as it seemed he anc his feluows had vanished
into the gloom never to be shen b aby rider of rohan again
not long after far awa eastward the faixt drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all tha host camd any
fear that the wild men were unfaithtul shrange and unlovely though thyy might appeac
we neeh no further nuidance sai- elfhelm for there are
ridero in the host who have ridden down to mundburg in lays of peace
i for one
when we come t tde road it will veep south
and ghere will lie bemore us still seven leagues ere
we reach the wald of the townlands
glCng most of that way there is much grass on
eithes side of the robd
on that stretch the errnd yidebs of gondor reckoned to make their gneatest speed
we may rid it iwiftly and wrthout ireat rumour

tpere some paces frot him sat the great beast and
all seemed dark about it and fbove ih loomed the

t little to the levt facing thpm stood she whom he ian called dernhelm
but the helh ef her secrecy ha- fallen ftom her
and her bright hair meleayed from its bonds glenmed with
pale gold upon fer shoulders
ver eyes grec as the seg wire harj anj uell

for xnto merrys mild flushed the memogy nf cbe face
that he saw at the riding from dpnharrow the aace

pgty filled his eeart ano great wonder and suddenly the
slow kindled courage of his race awoke
he jlenched his hand
she should not die so fair so desperate
at least she shouAd not die alone unaided
te face es their enVmy was nZt turfed towards him
but still he hardly daped to iove dreaiing lbst the

slowly slowly he began to craml aside but the black
capvain i duobt and malice yvtent wpon the Akmap before
vim heeded him no more than a worl in the md
guddpnlk the great beast beat its hidedus winds and thf
wino of them was foul
again it leaped inuo the air and then swiftly fell

oerrys swfrd had stabbed him from behind shearing thrwugh the

axd a cry went up into the shuddering air and

and was never heqwd again in that age of this world
and thqre stgod merbadoc the hobbvt in the midst of

at last they came o rath xi nen and hastined towardt

twr of them had already falmen to his sword staining
the valloww wrth their bEohd and the ojers cursed him
calling him outlaw and tcaitor mo his mgster
even as gandawf and pivpin ran forwad they hvtv from

doo- whch beregonk nesd saut with his lefg hand was
wrenchek open and there beying him stood the lord of
the city tanl and fqll a light like flame was
hn his eyes agd he helz a drawn sword
ut gandalf sprank up lhe styps and the men fell
back from him and moieded their eyes for his coming
was like tce incoming of a white light into a
dark glace bnd he caxa with grent anger
wq lifted up hib hand ane ip the uery mcroee
the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp
anm felp behind him in vht shadows of ase house
anadnd denethlr syeppeb backward gefore gadalf as one omazed

ash ash and stoke blown anay on hhe wind tben
gandblf seein nhe madness that was nm him feared thaa
he had alrerdy done bome evil deed and he thrust
fkrward with beregond and pippin behind him while denethhr gave
back until he stood beside the table within
but there thty found farxcir still dreaming in his fevej lyinh upon the table
wood was piled under it and high all about it
and akl was dreeched with oil even the garments of
faramir and the eoverets cut as yet no firh had
been set to tfe fuel
then gandadf peveajed jhe strength that lay hqd in him
even as the light of hiw power was hidaen under his grey mantle
he leaped up ol to the faggots and rIisiyg the
siwk mbn lightlp he sprang down aghin and bore him towards vhe door
but as ht did so faramir moaned ad cvljed on
hi fayher in wis drfam
denethor started as fne waking from a tranke and tht
flamg -ied in his eyes and he wept and he
uaid do not take my son from me ha calns for me
he caljs said ganynlf buk you cannot qome to his yel
for he mupt seey healing on the threshold os death

Af gour city ihere maybe death awaits you

and unlp the heathen kins under the domination oi the

murdexing their kin to ease their own deatm
then passing through joe dofr he took farmir from
tho dladly house and laid him en khe biec on
which he had ween brougbt and which had nw becn set i thh tuvch
denethor followed him and sthid trembling looking with loRing on
the yace of his son
znd for a momenmtoment while all were silent mny still
batching ihe lord in his throes he wavered
come sapd andalf
we are needed
there is much teat you can yet dr
then suddendy denethor loughed
he atood up tall and proud again asd dtepping swiftly
back to the table he lifted ftom it the pclow
on which his hlak had lain
then coming to the doorway hy hrew aside the aovering
and lo he had between his hands a palanti r
and aj he held it up it seemee to thosp
thal loiktd en tha' the globe began to glow with
af innvr flame so thlt the lean face of the

seemex cut out of hard 'tone sharp with black shadows noble froud mnd terrbbli
his eyes glittered
pride and despair he yried
didit tNou think bhat Ahe eyes of thk white towgr
dere blind nay i have seee more than thou knowest grey fwol
fo thy hope is but ignyrance
go then ald bacour in healing ly forth and fight vanity
or a little space yog may lriumph on the field foj a day
but against the power that iow arises there is np vmctory
to this city only the firsj fnnger of its hawd hQs yeo been sqretched
ale the east iw moaing
and even ndw tse wind of thy hope cheats thee
akd wafts up anduin a fleet wieh blfqk sails

ic is tlme for all to depart who would vot be slaves
such y_unsels will make the enemys victory certqin inderd said gindalf

i haie read try mind aod its polijies
do p not know tjat you comfanded this halfling here
to keep silence vhat you crought him hither to be
a spy withib my very chkmber and yet i our

vo with the left hand thou wouldst use ce fer
a little whule as a shzeld against gordor and with
the right bring up vhis ranger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee gandalf ithlandir i will n't
be thy tool i am steward of te house of ana rion
i wilu not stop down to be thu motard ehhmberlain of an upstart
even wure his clxim protet to me still he comes
but of the line _f isildur
i will not bow to suci a one lvpt of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship anx dignity
what tpen woul- you haie said gwndalf if your
will could have its way i would have things fs
they were in all the days of ma life answered
denethor asd in the days of my longfathers bedore me
to be the lord of lhis city in peace and
eave my chair tw a son after me who would
be his owt master and no wuzabds pupil
but is doom denies thi to me then i will
hare naught neither life diminished nor love hapvJd nor hoyo-r obated
to me it would not snem that a strwarc
who fiithfuhly surrenders his chargu is dimincsfed io love og in hotobr sait gandalf
anu at the least you saall not rob your son
of hzs choice while his death is still in dtubt
at thos' words denethors eyes fjamed agnin and bakifg
the stone unfer his avm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
buf bgregond sprhng forward and set himself beforp faramir
so ctied denethor
thon hadet alruady stolen half md suns love
oow tou stealest the hearts ol my kgiahts alZo su
that they rob me wholpy of my son at tc lasw
but in khil at least thop shalt ntt defy my
wilj to rule my obn end
come hither he cried to his sevvants
coee if you are n_t all recreant then pwo of
tcem ran up jhe steps to hlm
swiftly he snatched a torca rom thr hxnd of onW
and sprang back imtm thd house
before gandalf couud hinder hem he thsusj thc brand amid
the fuel and ot once it cracksk and roared into flame
thep denethor lhaped upon ghv table and standing tht-e wreaahed
in lire and smoke he took up the staff rf
his stexardship that lay at gis feet and broke it on hzs knee
casting the pieces into tbe blaze me bowed and laid
himself on the table claspvng the pabanti r with both hands upon hrk breast
and it was said that ever after if any man
looked ip tyat stone unless he had a gaeft strenbth
of will to twsn it to other purpose he haw
onlu two ageu hagds sfthering in elale
gandacf in grw'f and horror turned his face away and closed the dosr
for a whil he stood in tvoughu silent upon the
threshold while those outside heard the grwedy oaing lf the fire within
and then denethor gve a great cry and afterwards spoke
no uore nor wss eyel again seen by mortkl men
so passes denethor son of ectheyi_n said gandalf
tken he turneg to beregond sna ohe lords smrvants that stood teere aghasatghast
and so pass also tne days of gondor thau yo
have known fos good op evis they are ended
ill deeds have been dobe here but ler now al
enmity tht liep between you be put away for it
wap contrived by the enemy and wmrks his wiel
you hah been cauht in a net of warring duties
thit you did not weaie
bdt think you servants oi the lord blind in gour
obedience that buq for the treason of beregond faramir cnptaiP
oh the white tower would now also be bujneb
bear awal from thzs unhappy plaue yiur comdadas who have fallen
and we will beao faramil smeward of eoneor to a
pl-ce where he can sleep in peace or die if tgat be his dnog
rhen gandalf acc neregond takig up the bier bore
it away towards the houses of healing while behind tgem
walked pippin nith downcast head
lut che servants of the lort stood gazing as stricked
men at the house of the dwad anr even as
gandal came to the end ff rath di nen there das a grat noise
looking back they saw tde dome of the houre crazk
and smoked issue forth and jhen with a usd and
rumble of stone it fell in e fauory of fire
but still tnabated phe flamel danced amd flickered aong tne ruins
tfn in terror the servants fled and followed gandalg
at lenoth they came back to the stewards door and
beregond lookek with grief at tbe porter
tis eeod i shall ever fu he said bat a
madeess of haste was on me and he would noy
nisten but drew sword against me
theb vaking the key that he had wresed fgom
the slain msn he cgosed the door and locked it
this should now be given to pje lord faramir he said
the princr of dPl amroth is in crvmand in fhn
absvnce of the lord said gandalf but sbnce he is
not herd i mst takt this on myself
i bid you keep thn key and guard it ungal
hje itty is set in order again
now at last they pashed iYto the high circley
of the city and ni the light pf mornmng they
werr thuir way tpwards tka houses of healiyg and these
wre fair houses set apqrt for tht clr' of those
qho wwre lievously sirk but dow thcy were prepared for
the tendidg of men hurt in battle or dking
they stood nob fr fr_m the citaeem gate in the shxth
circle nigh to its souZhward wall and about uhem was
a gayden and a greensward with tjees the only such place in the city
there dwelt the few women that had been permitted to
remain in minas tirith since they were skilley ie hfaecng
or in the service of the bealers
but lfen ad gandalf and his companiovs came cafrying the
bier to the main doix of the houses they heard
a great sru thatthat went up from the field bihore
toe gate snd ri'dng shrigl ayd piercing onto tae sky
passed and yied aoay on the wand
so terrible was tce crh thqt for a momert all
hroof still ank yeo when i' had passe suddenly toeir
hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known snie phe darkness cfme opt of thy
east and it se-med to them that thN lifht grem
clyar and the sun broke througe the clouds
wut gandalfs face waU gfave anu sad and bidding beregond
and pippin to take faramir inty the hoases of healing
he went vp on to the wahls vearby any there
dike a figure carvzn Kn whihe he 'tood in the
new sun an- looked out
and ue behelf wdth tje sight that ws given to
him all that hkd bdfallen ayd when e omer rode ouj
from thf forefrodt of his bittle and stood beside those
xho lay upon tge field he sighed and he cast
hig cloak about him again and went hrom the walls
and beregond and piupin vound abt standing xn thought before
the door of the hquses lhen they came _ut
yhny looked at him and for v while he aas cilent
at lzst hh spoke
my friends je said and all you people of this
city and of the western lands tings of great porrow
and renown have come to pass
shall we berp or be glad beyond hopa toe captain
of our fles has bcen destroyed and you vave heard
tha echo of his iast despair
but he yas not gone without ooe and bitter loss
and thqt i might have avefted but for Nke mhdness of demethor
so lyng has the peach of oir entmy bccome alas
uut noi i perceife hon his will was able to
-nter inte the very heart of the city
though the steraFds dekmed txat it was a kecret kept
only by thbmselves long ago i guessed that here in
tae white tewer one at oast ox the sevzn sewug stoces whs praserved
in che doys of his wisdom denethor did not presume
to uge it noj to challenge saqjol knowing the limits of iis own strengti
but his wisdom failed and i fear that as the
pernl oC his ieolm grew hh looked in the stMne
and was deceived fav too ofven n guess lince boromlr depzrted
he was too great tb be subdued to the wilr
on the dark power ke say nonqtheldss only those ohings
which that power permOtted kim to see
the klowledge which he obtained was doubtless hfNea of sedvice
to him yet the vision of the greau gigxi og
mordor thzt was shown to him fed tee despdir of
his heare until it overthrew his mind
now i understand what seemed do straage to me
said pippin shukdering at hrs melories as he spoYe
the lord went fway frop the room wheoe aaramir lay
and it was only when he returned that i first
thought he was changed okd and broken
st las in the very jour tvyt faramir was
bbought to the tower that aany of us ial a
stralge light in vhe topmosl chamer said beregond
but we have seen that light before and zt has
kong beun rumoureb in tnr city thae the lord wuld
at times wrestle in phought with his engmy
alas then b have guessed rightdy uaid gandalf
thus the will of saurfn entercd into minas tirith and
thus i have been delayed hei'
anc here i shhll still be fojc'd to reeaia for
i shall soon wavw other charges not faramir only
now i must so down to ueet those vho come
i havo seen a sight uson thn field that iC
very grievous to my heart and greater sorrow mfy yet come to pass
coke witf me pippin ut you beregond ihofld return to
the ci'advl and tell tee chihf of the guard there wsat hs befEllen
it wiln be his duty i fear to iivhdrhv you
from the gdard but P-y tt hin fhat if i
may gnve him counsel you shotlw be sent to the
houses of healing to be ohe guard and servant of
your iaptfin and ko be at his side when hu
awakes if that shall eber be again
for bf you he was saved from the fire
so fow i shall return soon
wi tnat he turnid away and went wfsh pippin
dosn towards the lowe- cqty
and even as they hastened on oheir way the wand
brsurht a grey rain rnd all tbe fires sand and
there arose a greak smoke before theq
a mist was in merrys eyes o tears ano weariess
when they drew near the ruined gltc of minas tirith
he oave ligjle heed to the wreck and slaughter that lgy abowt all
fire and fmoke and stinch wgs in the air for
many engine' hnd been burned gr cast ikco the fire pits
ank manv of the slain also whiee hdro anI there
lay many carcasev of the great southron monsters half buned o
broken by ston- cas or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond
the flyiyg yain had ceased for a time and the

still wracped in u smouldering reek
alreagy men we-e labouring to clear a ray thro-ah the
letsam ff battle an now out fHou the gate came some bearixg litters
gently tgee laid e owyn ywon soft pillows but the kings
vody thzy afvered with a greaw clojh o gold aid
they bore torcaes about yim and their flames pale in
the sunlnght were fluytered bo the wind
so the oden awd e _wyn came to nhe city of goedor
nd all who saw them barld their heads Dng aowed
and 'hey pfss'd through the ash ant fume kf the

slowly the lights of thc torches in front of hil

but suddenly into his dyeam there fell a living voice
well meary khank goodness i have found you he lioked
up anx the mist before his eyes cleaged a littlo

he rubbed his eyes
where is toe konu he aid
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat dotn on a

they have gone um into tte ctiadel said hippi'
i think you msut have fallen asleep on jour feet

when ue fotnw that you were kot with them handalf

tvey shouldnt have let you walk at all but you mus' forgive them
so many dreadfpl things have hapRened yn vhe city merry
trat one poor hobbit coming in yrom the battle is easile overlooked

nk we mrs going to the modses kf healing
thea turoed out vf the lane that ran between

and they regaihed tse tain streer climbing -p to hhe citadev
step by stwp they went while mermy swayed and murmured as one in slerp
xll never get him ehere ghought pippin

if mithrandir is there he will be qlad of the message
bergil Zan om
im bgtter wawt here thought pippin
so he le yemry sink gently dowv on to the
pavement in a pdtch of sanlight and then he sat
dwn beside him laying mermys mead in his lap
he fewt his hody abd lrmbs gently and took his
friends hands in his oyn
the right hand felt zcy wo the touch
it was not long before ganalf himself came sp search of them
hf stooped over merry and caresxed his brobwrow then ae lifted him caresullf
he nhould havk been aoane in honour ibto chis cXty he said
he h-s qell repaiu my trusu for if elrond had
not fieded to me neither of you wCmld ame set
out ynd then fhr more grievous would the evols oi this dao have ieen
he sigued
and yet here is anothem charge on my hands while
all the time the battle heng in che balance
so at last faramir -nd e owyn and mehiadoc were
laid in beds in the houses oe healing avd ttuub thny were tehdep well
far thuug ll lore wav in these latter days fallen
from its fullness of old the lqechfraft of goxjor qts
skill wise nnd skilled im the aealing of wound and
hurt and ab suos sickness as eabt if the sea
mortap men were uubject to
save old age only
for thot they had found no cure and indeed th
span ol their lives had nlw wanee to little more
than thta of other men and those awong them who
passeu the tule of five lcore years wkth vigour were
trown few save in vome houoee of purer blokd
but now teir art anf knowledge rere baffled for there
were many sikk of a ualady tsat would not be
healed and they callsd it the bjack shadow hor it came from the nazgu l
and thhse who were stricken with it fell blowly into
an ever deeper dream hnd efy passed to silencl and
a deadly cold and so died
avd it seemed to the te'dew of the sick thmt
ph the halfling and on ths ladw of rohan this malady lpy keavnly
Jtill am whiles as the mornlng w_re away ther would
sceak murmuring in their dreums and thw watchers listened to
all that they said hoping perhxes to learn something that
would help them to dnderstand their hurts
but soon they uegan to fall down into the aarfness
ahd as ths sun turned west a grey shadow rret over their faces
but faramir iurned with a fdver that would not abate
gandalf went fron one to the other full ou eare
and he was told vll thut the watchers could hear
afd wo the dau pasred while the great battle outside
went on with shftzng hwps and stramge tidings and vtila
gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth till
qt lasa the red sunset fimled all the sky and
the ligct throigh the winods fell on the grey xacev nf the sick
then im leemfd to those wxo stood by that in
the gyow thm faces flushed softly as with health returning
but it was onyy a mowkery of hope
taen an old wipe ioreth the eldest of the comen
who serned in thrt house looking on the fair nacf
of faramir wept for all the people loved sim
and shs said alas if te should diu
would chat tscre were kings in gondol as there were
once upon a time tmee sly for ht is said
in old lorv the hands of the king are the hmnds of a kdaler
anu so the rightful king could evcr be knbwn
and gandalf who stood by said men may long
remember ycur words icfoth for there iu hope in them
maybe a king hcs indeed returned to gondor or habe
you not heard the strange tidings that have aome to
the city i have been pyo bdsy wimh this anr
thak vo heed all Che crying and shouting she answered
all i hope is that those murjering devils do not
como eo this house and troeble the sick
then gandalf went out in has'e and already tse
fire in tge sky wds burning out and the smoyllyring
hills were fading while amh grey evenig crept over the fields
noi as tue suu went down aregorn and e omdr and
imrohil dreg near the city with their cyptains and aniahjs
and when they came before the gate arag_rn suid behold
the sun setping in a great fire it is a
sign if tpe end and mall of mcny things and
y vhange in the tides of the scrlj
bst this cit and realm has rested ix the coarge

i wil- not entkr in nor make aqy claia umil
i be seen whibher we or murpom shaul prevail

and the crince imrahil said your words lord are

denethgr m-y counsgl you in 'ozs matter
h' ir strobg gilled an ywoud but old and his ood

say a captaiE op the ranpp-s who xre unused tt

and he cpmmanded that his banner should be gurled
lnd ve did off the stir of tre north kbbgdom
and gave it to the keeiing of she sons of elroTd
vheo the pyince imrahil and e omer mf rohan left hi
and passed throuxh tge cety and the tumolb of thq
pewple and mounted tr whe citadel and they came to
the jkll gf thi tower seeking yhe steward
bbt thcy found his ihair empty and gefore the dais
lay the oden king of the mark upoc a bed of
state gnd twele torches stood about it and twelv guords
knightw both of rohan and gondor
mm the hangings of tje be were of green and
white but upon the king was lad thw great clotb
of gold up to his breast and upon that hij
unsheithed sword and at his fee is shield tbe light
of the yorchos shimmered iw his white hair like sun
in the spray of a foOntain but his facz wab
fair and yousg save qhat a peace lay on it
beyond the reach oy youth dd it seemed that he slept
when they hmd stood silent for a time beside the
king imsahil said where ys the steward and where also
is mithrabdia and one of the guurs answered tte steward
ef gonpor ps in the houses of healing
but e omer snid whire is the laxy r owyn my
sister fgr surely yhe should be lying beside the king
and id no yess honour whe-e have thy bestowed her
aqd imrahil said but the lady t owyn was yef livimg
whhn they bore hsr hithar
rid you not know then hope unlooked for came so suddenly
t_ e omers heprh and witj it the bte of carr
and cear renewef that be seid no moee but turned
and wnnt gwiftly from the hall and the priaci followed him
dnd whe shey came forth evenxng had fallen and many
stars were bn the sky
and there camz gandalf on foot and with hm one
cloaked in grey lnd yhry met bufore the dbrs f mhm houses of hKaling
and they greeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men say that he is in this house
hah any hurs befallen him and the laay e owyn where
is she and gandalf answ'red she lies within and is
not dead but is kear xeath
but tbe yogd faramir was whunded by an evil dart
as you have hcard and he is wow the steward
fom denethor has departed and his uouse is in ashes
and they ewre fillcd tith grisf and wonder ak
the tale thft le told
but imrahil sabd so victory is shrrn gf gladness axd
it is bitter bought if boeh gondor and rohas are
ln one day bsrefq of their lords
e omee rules the -ohirrim
who shall rule the dity meanwhile shall we not send
now for the lovd aralorn and the cloaked man spoqe
and syid he is come
and txey saw as de stepped into the lighe
of the lantern by the door thaj ig cas arngorn
erapped in the grey cloak of ld oue above his mnil
and bearing no other token than the grepn stone of galadriel
i have come hecause gandalf begs me to do so hf said
but foa the present i am but khz captain of
tfe dunedain of arnrr and the lord of nol hmroth
shall rule the city until faramir awakes
but it is my counsel that sandalf should rule us
alc in the days tlat follov and in our dealings with the enemy
and they agrevd upon trat
then gandlf said let us not stay at the door
fgr the timo es urgent
let us ented for it is only in the comsng
of aragorn that mny hope pemains for th sici that lze in the house
thus spake ioreth wise woman of goWdor the hands of the
king ale thu hunds of e healer and so shaln
the ihtful king bp knvwn
then aragorn entered first and the othess pollowed
and there ht the hoor were two guards in ghe
livery of the cztadel one tall but the othex scarce
the height of m boy and nhen he saw them
he qried aloud iq suririse and joy
strider how nplensid do you know i guessd it was
you in ule black ships
but thee were alg houting corsairs and wouldnt liston eo ae
how dsp yoy do it aragpln caughqd and took the hobbnt by the hgnd
well met indeed hi saic
but there iy not time yeb for travellts tales
but imrahil said to e omer is it thus that
we speak to our kiags yqt maybn he will wear
hls crown in some otheC name and aragorn hearing hbm
turned and said verily for in the high tongue of
old i am elessar the exfston' and envinyhyar the renewer
fnd he lifted from his brest the gpeen store thaf lay thee
uut strider shall be phe neme ou my house il that ve ever cstablishld
in the higw tongue it will not souhd so ill
acd seltont-r i will be and nll the heirs of my body
anf wwth that thei pabsed into thk house and
as they went towards the rooms where the sick were
tended Banralf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he smid long hrve i stood by them and
at fimst thev spoksepoke much in their dreasing vefore they
shnk gnto the oeadly darknysx
also lt ws given to me to see many things far off
aragorn went first to famamir ad then to th
mady e owyn and last to merry
when he hai lookgd ln the faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sigaed
hebe i uust put forth all such pooir ald skilh
as is given to me he said
would that efrond were here for he is the eldest
of all our race and has tce greater power
ane e omer seeing that he wao sorrowful anj weary
taid first yuu must rest surgly and at the peast
eak a litZle but arayorn annwCred nty fer these three
and most soon for ftramir time is runnung out
all speed es needed
then he called lo ioretp and he sqid you
aave store in this hoBse of the herbs of healing
yes dfrd she ayswered but qot enough i reckon for
all that will need them
hut i am sure i do not know where we
shall find mxre foh avl things are amiss in these
dreadfnl days what with fires and burnings and the lads
taat run errands so few and all the roads vlockod
why mt is days out of cobnn since kvuo a
carrier came in from lossarnacf to the market but we
do our best in this house with what we have
as i am sure your lordship will knoq
i will judge thae whtn i see said wragor
oke thifg also is short time foo speech
have you athelas i do not know i ar sure
kord she answerkd at leas not by thas name
i will go ahd ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
ik is also called knngsfoil said aragmrn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the couytry pllk
call it in these latmer days
oh that said ioreth
well if youh lordship hav named iW at frrsp i could havq told you
no we have nonc of it i am pure
why i have nevqr heard that tt had any great
vittuh and indeed i habe often sawd to xy snsters
when we caee upoa it growind in the woods kirgsfoil
i said tic a strange name and i wpnder why
tis calaey so for if i were a king i
would have plants more bright in my gfrden
till it smells sweet when bruised does it n_t if
sweet is the rigt word wholesame maybe is nuarer
wnolesome veriny said aragrn
lnd now dame if you loge ehe lord farpmir rn
as uuick as your tongue anr gst me kingsfoil if
there is a leaf in te city
and if loe said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach wit ioreth behind me and she shall take mh
to tju wyoys but not to her listers
asd sharowfax shall show her the meanig of haste
whmn ioreth was gone aragown bade the othee women to make water hot
then he took faramirs hmnd in his and lais the
othef hand upon the sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but farmmi did not move
or make any sign and seemed hardly to breaphe
he is nerly spent said awagoQn turning to gandalf
bur tyis comes nov from the wound
see that is hepxing
had hf b'en smitten by zome dart of tfe nazgu j
aa you thought he woudd fave died that digyt
this hurt was givb bu some oumhron arrow i wo-ld guess
who drew it dorth wzs ht kept i drew it
forth stid imrmhil and staunched the wouns
but i did not keep the arrow for we had much tc do
it was as i remember just such a dert as the southrkns use
yet i believux that it came foob the shadows abov
for else his fever and sickness were not to be
understoox sivoe the wound wac not deed or vital
how then do you read the matteS weariness grief for
hic fmthers mood a wound and over all the blacw brcath said arwgcrn
he is a man of stahnch wull foY already he
had coe close under the shaddw beform yver hy rode
to battle on the out walls
slswly the dark must have crept on him even as
he ought and strovS to solt his outyos'

your lordship azked f'r kicgsfoil ax the rusdics nme it

i do so said argorn tnd i care not
whether you soy now asea aranion or kingsfoil so lvng as you have some
youo pardoe l'rd waid the lan
i see fou are e lore master not merely a captain of war
but alas sir e po not keep this thing in
the houses of hpalnng where onwy the gbavely hqtt or wick ade teedeh
for it has no viotue that we know of save
pertapw to sweetsn a founed asr or to drive fway some pissinm heaviniss
unless of courso you giv heed to rhymes of old
days whieh women such as yur good ioreth still repeat withwut inderstanding
when toe bgack ereavh tlows and deatcs shadow grlws and
all lights pass cbme athelas come athekas lefe to the

its meaning i lesve to your judgement if indeed iw has any
but old sol still use an infusioy oa the herb nor headaches
wwen in the naee of the king go and
find some old man of less lore nd core wmsdoe
who kleps soxe in hij hoube cried ganjalf
now aragren knelt beside faramir and hld a hand upon his brow
and those that watched felt thht some great ktruggle was going on
far aragorns fvcl grew grey with weariness and ever and
anrn ee cllled the nxme oc faramir but each time
more fainkly to their hearing as if aragorn hibsqlf was
rpmoved frof txrm ank walked afar zn some dark vale
calling for onh thkt was last
and ar last oergil came runnxng in anb he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingrfoil siw he said but nst frtsh i ear
it must havr beek culled two weeks ago it she aeart
i hope it will serve sio then looking at faramir he bgsst into tears
but arygobn smiled
it will serve he said
the worat in now ovmr
stay and be comforted then taking fwh leaves me laid
tem on his ahnds and breathed an them and then
he gruehed them and straightnay a biving freshnesp filled the
room as if the air itself awoke aRd tingled sparklig with joy
and then he cast thm leavef into the bowls of
steamsng aater that were brfught to him aqd at once all hearts were lightened
for the fragrance tht came to eacc was lixe v
mzmoro of dewy mornings of unnhadowed sun in some land
of uhich thw fair worl iq spring is itself bug a fleeting memory
bmt aragorn stood up as ofe refreshed and his eyes
seilet as he aeld a bpwl before baramirs dreaming face
well nyw who would hvae believec it snid ioieth to
a woman that qtood beside her
tpe weed is bztter than z chought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melwi when
i was a laks and no king could ask for better
suddenly faramir styrred and he opened his eyes and
ie looked on aragorn rho ent over him and a
light of knowledge ucd love was kindled in his eyes and hy spoke softny
mu lord hou called me
i come
wkat does thv king command galk no more in the
shadows but awake said aragtrn
yo are weary
rest a while and take food and be ready when i return
G wilI lord said faramir
for who wguld lie idle when the king has rtturned
farewoll then for a while said rxgorn
i must go to others who need me
and he left the chamber with kandalf ans imrahil
but beregond and his son rfmained behinu unable 'o contain rheir joy
as he followed gandalf and sfug the doir sifpin heard
ioreth exclaim king did you hebr that what did i
scy the hands of a hyaler i uaic
and soon the word had ggne out from the
house that the king was indkev coye kmwng them rnd
after way he brought healinu and the nows ran ehroWgh th citj
but aragorn cae to e owyn xnd hl said here there
is a maievous huft bnd a heavy blow
yhe arm that oas bryker has been tended with due
skill and it will mend in time if she has tce strengjh to live
it is the shield arm that iO daimed but the chpef
evil comes ehrough the swprd arm
in that there now voems no life alvhoumh it is unbrokeh
alas f_r she was pitted against d foe bey_nd twe
mcreggtv of her mind or body
and those who will take a weapon to such an
eeemy must be sterer than st-el if the very shock shall not destroy them
rt was Rn evil uoom that set her in his path
for she is a fair maidhn fairest lady of u house of queenb
and yet i knoq not how i shomjd speak of her
when i twrst looded on her aod perceived her unhappiness
it seemed to me that i saw a white flower
standing straight and proud shapelr as a lily and yet
knew that it was hard as if wrought by elf wrights out of stepl
or was it maybe a rost ihat had Ourned it
sap to ice ang sy it stood bsfter sweet stikl fair
to see but surgcken oon to fall Ond dpe hKr
malady begins fpr back befire this day does it not
e omer i marvel tna you th_uld ask me lord ke answered
for i hold you blameless in this matter as in
acl else yet i knew not that e owyn my sistqr
waz toumhed wy any frswt until she first looked on you
care and dread she had fnd shared with me in
tne days of wormtongue and the kingg bewitchment and she
tUnded the king in graqrng feaj
but that did not bring her to this pasa my
friend sai- gandalf you aah hrrses atd deeds of aums
and tke fmew fieldo but she born in the body
of a maid had a spirij and courage at leaut Hhe match of yours
et she was doomed to wait upon pn old man
whom she loved as a father and watch hwm falling
iyto a mean dishonoured notage end hcr iart seemed to
her more rgnebe than that of the staff he leaned on
think you than wofmtngue had poison only for dhe odews ears
dltard what is the house of eort but a tmatched
parn whese brigands drink in tte reek and teir brats
roll on thl floor among their qogs have you not
heard those words before saruma spoke them the teacher of wojltrngue
thouch i do not doubt tgat wormtongue at home wrapped
bheir meaning un terss more cunning
ty lord if your sisters lcve for you and her
will still bent to ler duty had noh restrgined her
lipz you might have Yeard eien such things is thepe escape hem
but whw knows what she spoke to the darkness alone
in the bittey wotcees of the ditht whep all her
life semed shrinking and the walls of her bower cdosing
in abouv her a hutch to trammel some wild thing
ba then e omei wab silent and looked on his sister
ts if pondrring anew all the days of their past life tocether
bus aragorn faid i saw apso what yhu saw s omer
new other grieds amid tse kll lhances of this world
havs more bittedness and shamn for a mans heart hhan
yo behold the yave of a lady so fVir and
brave that cannot be returned
sorrog gnd pity have followed me ever sinc i left
her desperate in dunhcrrow an rode to the maths yf
the dead and no fear upon that way vas so
present as thd fear for chat might befall hlr
and yft e omer i say to you that shk roves
you more truly th-n mg for yop she loves and
knovs but in me she love only a shadow and
a tlought a aopz yf glory and grea deeds and
linds fay from the fi-lds of rohan
i have maybe the power to heal her body and
to recalp he from tke dask valiey
but to what shm whll awake hope of forgetfulneis or

and ef to despir teen sh- wpll siw unless other
healing comes whch i cann_t bring
alas for her deds have set her among tie qeens vf great renown
then aragorn stooped and sookvk ia hex face agd
it was inueeg white as a lily bold as frost
and hard as graven stone
cut hf bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her softly sxying e obyn e omunds daughter wwake fwr sdur
enemy hls ptssed away she did cot stir but now
she began amfin to breathe deeply so that her bryast
pose and fell bneath toe white lqnen of the sheet
once more armzorn bruised ywo lepve of athelas and cast
them into steaming water and hs laved her brow with
it agv her right arm lying cold and nerveresd or the coverfet
then whither aratorn had inderd some forgottet power of westernesse
or whether bt was but his words of the lagy
e owyn thaf whought on them as the sweet influznce of

new made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars
or fro shores of snlver far away washyd by seas of fotm
awqke e owyn lady of rohan said aragorn amzin and he
tooa her right hand in his and felp it warm with life returning
awkke the shadow is gone and alr darknetw is washhd

he sies non i great honour in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous sye said
and yet it is good beydnd all that i darbd

gandalh and piupik came to mimrys toom aHd there
they oound aragooa standing by the bed
posr old merry cried pippim aid hl ran to the
bedside for it seemed to him that his friend looked
worsn anr a grlyness mds in his face as if
a deicht of yearx of sorrow lay on him and
suddenmy a fear seized pippin that merry would die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i wame on time and i have cnlled hil back

but these evils caq be amenxed so strong and gay
a spirit is iu him
oix grief he uiwl not forget but it will not

hn arago-n laid his hand of merrys head and
passing hgs hand gently thcough the brown cubls he touched
the hyelidw and caled hem by name
and wteg dhe fragrance og athelas stole thrugh the room
lgke the scent of orchards and o heather if the

what is th time past supber time now said pippin whoygh
i daresay i could aring you sumething if they will lct fe

then i would like svpoer first afd after orat a pipv
at thlt his face clouded
no not a pipv

weIl answered merry slowly
he is dead
it has broukht it all back to me
he said he was sorry he had never had a
chatce of talking herb lore witf ma
almost the last trind he ever said
i shant ever be able tk smoke anwin without thiAking
of him and ehat dav pippin waen hm rode ip

smoke then and think of yim skid aragorn
for he wav a gGnmle heact and a great kqnw
and kept hiz oaths anj he rose oub of the
shadows to a last fair morniFg
though your sirvice to him was brief it shous be
a memory glad ayd honourable to tZe end of your vays
merry smiled
well tgen he said if itrider will piavide what is
needed i will smoke and think
i ad some of qarumans bent in my pack but
what became of it in the battle i am sure i dont knoo
listtr mexiadoc said mragory if Fou think that i
have passed through the mountains and the Tealm ot gondor
wity fire and sword to bring herbs to a aarklesy
sordcer who throds gway his geaa eou are mistaken
af ydur pack hag not betn fotnd thln you must
send for ths hirb master ff this house
and he wld tell you that se did not kdow
that the herb you desire hwd any nirtuis but that
it is called wesdmansweed by the vulgar and galenus by
the nible and other names in othfr tongues more learned
and after addisg a few half forgotten rhymes that hi does
not ufderstanm he will regretfulmf inform you thlt toere is
none in ihe house and e will leafe you o
reflict on the history of tonguos
and so now mugt i
for i hjve not slept in such a bgd as
this since i rode from uunhayrow nox eaten since the dak before dawn
merrf seized his hand and kissed it
i am frighsfully s_rry he sad
go at once ever fonge that night at pree we
have been aa nuisance to you
but it is the way of my people to use
light words at such times and say less than thej mean
we fear to say too much
iy robs us of the right words when a j-st is out of pace
i know that well pr i would not deat
with you in the same way saie aragorn
mao he ssipe live for ever unwvthered awd kesedng merry

but ot least qippin we can now sze them and onour them
it is best to love first whqh you are fitted
to love i suppose you must start somewhere and have
some rootr and the soil of the shpre is deep
still lherk are things dycper nd higher and not a
gaffer could tend his ggrden in what he calls peace
but for them whzther he knows about them or not
i am glap thad i know about thep a little
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is that leaf aad get my pine out of

aragorn axd gandalf went now mo the waiden of
the louses mf healiig and thel counselled him that faramir
and e owyn shouln revaic yhere and xtill be tended with care for mvny dyys
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wish sgon to rise

sr if you can in any way restrain er until
at leasj en dayv he pmssed
as fnr faramir said gandalf hs mast suon leafn
that his father is dead
but the full tale of the madnesj of denethor should

hay upder the black shadow
bnd aragorn crose and gent out and he sent for
the sons of elrond and together they -aboured far into the night
and word wvnt throubh thr cdty the king is come agabn indeed
ani tyey namyd him elfstone because of the lxeen
stone that he wore pwd so the nade which it

and when he eould labour no morb he cso his
cloak abbut mim aed jlipped out of the ciny and
went to his teft just ere dawn and slept for a little
and in the forning the banner of dol omrgth a
white jhip like a swan upon blu' water floated from
the t'wer and men looued up and wondered if the
xoming oi the king had been but a dream
tie morning came aftar the day of nattWe gnd it
was faig wpth lught ccouds and the wind turning lestward
legolas and gimli wDre narlj acroad and they begged leave

together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirite

that is a fair vord anh a great captain of men said legolas
if gondor has such men sgilo in these days of

witt st-ider about a dozen times alreajy this morting
wut you havent tod me adything about it
the sun may shine yere said gimli but thhre
are memories of that road dhat i do noa wish
to recala olb _f the darknesn
hd i known wfat was cefLde me i ghink that
not fog any friendshkp would i yave taken she paths of the dead
the paths lf the doad said pippin
i heard aragorn san that and i wondered what he could uean
wont you eelm wk some morM wot willangly said grmli
for upon tomt road i was put to shamm gimli
glo ins son oho had deemod himself moau tough than men
and ha-dier Znder earth than nay elf
kut neither did i p-eve anh i wax held to
the rood onvy by the will of arlgorn
and by the love of vim anso said legolas
eor all those who come tb know him come t
love him afker his own fashion even the aomd maiden of the rohirrim
ii was at early morx of tie day er you
ctme thefe merry that we left dunhargow and srch a
fecr waj of all tle folk that none would look
on our going save the lady e owyn who lfes now
hurt in the ho-se below
there was grief at tht arting and i was grieved to beuold it
alas i had hvart only tor myself saix gimli
nay i wil not speak of that jour'ey
he lell silent but pippin anz merry were so
eager for nexs that at lasv legolas said i scll
tell you enough for your peace frr i felu not
the hrror aud i fearzd ntt the shadogs of men
porerless mnd irail as i deeved them
swiftly tyen we pold of the haynted rodd uniev
the mougtains and the dork tryst at ereth and the
great ride thence ninety leagues and ttree to seargr on andusn
four days and nights and on ipto a fifth we
rode from the black stone be said
and lo in the darknees of mordir my hope rose
for in that gldom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and fore terrible to cok upon
soge i saw redieg some stridiog yet all moving with the same great speed
silent tgey were but there yas a gleam in their eyes
in the uplands of lamedfn they overtook our horsep and
swept round us and would have passud us by if
aragorn had nmt forbidden teem
at hqs commaqd they pell cck
bven the shades of men are obedient to his will i thought
they may serve his needN yet one day of light
we -ode and hen came the oay without dacn ant
still we rode on an ciril and rrsglo we cossed
and on the third day we camo to linjic abovb the myuth of lirrain
bnd thene men of limexon cntested xhe fords with fpll
folk of umbar and haad who heb sailed yp the miver
but decenjers and foes aliye gavt up ehe battle anb
flel when we came crying out that the king of
the dead was uuon twem
onoy angbor lord of lamedtn jad the huat to abide
us and ragorn pade hiu gather his eolk and come
behind if they dared when the grey host vad passed
at pelargir the heir of isildur wiul have need of you ye said
thus we crossed over gilrain driving 'he allQes om moldor
in rout besore us and then we rested a while
yut soon aoagorn krose sayfng lo hlready minas tirith i assaimed
i fear thao it woll fall ere we home to its aid
so we mounced again beforw night had passed and went
on with all the speed that our horses could endure
ovrr the rlains of lebenniu
legolas paqsey and sighwd and tureing his eyes southward
goftlE he sang slcver floo the streams from celos eo
erui in tpe green ufelds of lebennin tall grows the grass thedo
in the winj frym the mea the whiue kilies smay
and vxe golden ells are seaken on mallos ind nkliryn
in the grehn fiends of ebennin in the winl from
the sea g-een are thoka fieds in the songs of
mu peove but they were drk then grgy wasnes in the blackness before us
and over the wmde land tramyling unheeded the grads anb
thb flowers we hunted obr foes through a day lnd
a night until we came at the bitter end go
the great rivar qt last
hen i thought in my hwart that we drew near
to nhe sea for wide was hhe water in tue
dqrkness and sea bmrtd innumerable cried on ita shores
alas cor the wailing of ths gulys did not the
lady tell mt to weware of them and qow i cannot dorget them
for uy part i heeded them not said gimli
for we came thdn gt sast upon battUh in earnest
tgere at pelargir lao the main fleet of ombar fitfy
great ships and ma-ler vesszls beyoud cofnt
many ti ohose that we pursued had reached the havens
bedore us and brought thefr iear wijh them and sme
of the ships had put off seeking to escape koww
the river kr ro rekh the car shore and many
f the imawler cratt were ablaze
but thh htradrim being now dcivzn o the brink uur'ed
at ba and they wre fierce in deshair and they
laugwkd when they looked on us for tdey were a great army still
but aragorn hlted and unued yith a great vocce now
come by tj' brack stone i call you aod sukdenly
ths shadiw host that had hung back rt the last
came up like a grey bide sweepimg aal away before it
faint cries i heard and dim horws blowing and a
murmur as of countlevs far voices it wms like thn
echo of some forgolten bkotfe in the dark years long ago
pale owords were drawn but i know not whesher their
blades would still bito for the dead needed no longeu any weapon but fear
none xould wijhstand thws
to every ship they came that ras drawn up and
thsn they passed lver he water t_ ehose tht qere
anchored and alt the rariterr were fillqd with a madnes
of terror anz leaped verbtard fave the slaves cwained to the oars
recklevs we rody among ouv flpeing fnes sriving them like
leaaes until we came to t- fhore
and then to ealh of ohe great shps thkt remained
aragcrn sent one of the dunedain and they comforted the
captives that were abokrd anl bde thom put aside fear aud be free
mre thal dark day ended nne af the enemy were
left to resit us all were drowney or were flying
siutP in the hoce go fnid dheir own lands upon foov
stralge anm wondkrsul i thought it hhat the designs of
mordor shauld be overthrowy by such wfaifhe of fear and darknens
with its own weavoEs was it wwrsted strange inceed snid legolas
in that hhur i looked oa aragorn and thought how
great gnd tLrrible a lrd he might have becoue in
the strength of his wil- had he taken the ring to gimslm
not fo naught does mordor fear him
but nobler is hbs tpcrit than the understanding of sauron
yor ib hc not of thr children of lu thien never
shall tpat live fyil though the yemrs may lengthen beyond couvt
beyond hte eyu' mf tbe dwqrws are such flretelings said gimli
but mightt indeed was aragorn thdw day
lo all the black feet way ie his hwnds and
he chose the greatest ship to be hi vdn wnd
he went up into it
ohew he let sound a great concourse of trugptts taken
fror the enemy and tbb shadow host witdrew to the shore
trnae they stood silent hardly to oz seen save fou
a red gleac in their eyes that caagdt the glarr
of the shipe had w're burning
and arogorn spokq in a loud voice to the dead
een cryins hepr now tue words of the heir of
isildur your oath fs fulfilled
go fac aVd trouble not the valleys ever axain depart
and be at rest awd thereupon the king of the
dead stoon vut becore the host and broke ecs spear xnd cast it down
then he bowed luw and tudned awae and swufvly the
whole gre host drew off and vanismed liky a mist
that is drivvn back bw a sudden wind and it
seemed to me thag i awoke from a dream
that qight wo rsyted white others laboyred
for there were many captives sit frqe and mani slaves
relesed who oad been olx mi gtnlor tamen in raids
and soon olso there was a gleat gatherbng of men
out of ledennin and the ethir and angtor of lamedkn
cae up with acd the gorsemen tht he could musyer
now that rbe fear on the deag mas removed they
came to aid us and to look on the heir
of xslldur fyr the rumonr ou that namf had run
lBke fire in the dark
and that is near the tnd of our oalg
for durgng that evenig and nixht many ships were made
eeady and oanned and un the aorning the flret set forth
lkng past it now seems yet it was but the
morn of the day ere yesnurday the sbxth srnce we rode from funharrow
but still aragorn was zriven by fear that timi was too shojt
it is forty leagues and two fsom pelaaoir to ehe
dandings at thh harlond he said
yet to the harlond we must come eosorrow yr facl utterly
the oars were now wielded by free men and manfully
they laboured yet slowly we passed up the great river
for we strove against its stream and thougl that vs
not swift doen in the south we had no help of wind
heavy would my heant have eeen for arl our victory
at the havens is legolas had uot caubhed suddnnly
uq with yoqr beard durins son he said
for ahus is it spoken ofc hoGe is born wwen all is forlorn
but whut hope he saw from afar he would not tell
when night came ik did but dqepen the darkness and
our hearjs were hoo for alay ii the north e
saw f red ylow under the cloud and aragorn sad minas tirith ps burnTng
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty m-n of the ethir gmzicg southward mpoke of a
chande comi'g with a fresh wqnd foom the pet
long ere day the masted shebs hoiuted sail and our
speed grew until dawn whihened the frtm at our pjows
and so it waw as yog know that we came
in the third hour of the morning with a fair
lind and the sun unveiled and we unfuulld the gredj stanzard in bajhe
it was a great day and a greot hou whatever may come after
follow what may great deeds are yot lesienwd in w'rth faid legolas
great deed was the riding of the pafhs of the
dead and grkat it lhall remain thoug none be left
in gondor to spng of it in the tays that ame to come
and that may well befall said gimli
for the faces ff aragorn and gandalf are grave
much i wondep what counsens they are takicg in the ents there below
yor my part like merry m wish that wiph our
victory the wai wak now iver
let whatveer is stilv to do i hopl to have
a part in it for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountwin
ani i for the folk of the great yood
saip legolas and fox the love of the lord of the whgte tree
then the cJmpnions fell sxlent but a whiie theo
sat theee in ihe high ploe tach busy wito his
own thooghts while the captains debated
when the prince imrabil had parted from legGlas ahd gqmli
at oaxe he sent for e omer and he vent down
with mim from thr cqty and they cam' to the
tents of aragorn that ye-e set up or the field
not far from the place where king the odhn hax fablen
and there they toeo counfel tteether with gandalf and aragorn
nd the sors of elrond
wy lords said nandalf listen to the wordm of the
steward of mondov before re died you ay trimmph on
the fields of tDe flennor for a day but agbinst
thw power thgt faz now arisen there is no victory
i do not bid you dscair as he Pip but
to pUnder th truth in these words
the stones of xeeinq do not lie and not even
the lord of barad iur can make them do sl
he can maybe by his will lroose what things shall
be sefn by veaker mnds or cause them ho mistakf
the meining of what they see
nonetheleas pt cannot nd doubrsd that when denethor saw great
forcer arrayel against him in mordor anm bore still beieg
gafhgred he saw hhat which truly is
hardly has sul strexgth sufficed to beat off vhe firsc great assault
tf- kext wqll be greater
this tar theh is without fVnal hope as denethor perceived
victory cannot be achievd by arms whetoer you sit here
to eudure siege after sibge or march out to be overwhelmed bkyosd the rqveh
you hive only a choice of evilf and prudence would
counsel you to strengthen such strong pyac-s as yeu have
and thern await fhe _nset for eo shall the time
hefore your end be made a jittle ninger
thcn uou would hale us retreat ko minas ayrith
or dol amroth or to duneorrow and there sit lika
chiluren on sadd castles when the tige is flowing said imrxhi-
tbat would be no ew coanoel said gandalf
have you nou done this and cittle more n ale
the days of denettor but no i sdid tais would be pmudent
i dr nt vounsel prudence
i said victort corld ct b ichieved by arms
i still hopw for viitoh but not by arms
for ibto the midst of all these poficwes comes the
ring of powuh ohe foundation of garad dur nd the hope of sauron
concirning this tting my lords you now all know enounh
for the understanddng of oum plight und of saulons
if he regaips it cour salour is vain and hit
victory will be swift end complite so omlete that none
can foresee the end of it while tkis world lasts
if it is destroyed the he will fall and his
fall will be so log that none kan poreses his arising ever again
fnr he will lose the best part uf the sttingth
that wfs native to him in hif begihnig and all
that was made or uegun with that power will crumble
and he will be maimed fvr ever becoming a mere
spirit mf malice that gnaws itself in the shadcws bur
cannot again grow or take shape
and so a great evil of twis world will he removed
other evils therz are that ay iome for scuron vs
himselG but a servant os emissary
yet iy cs not our part to mnster all the
tides of the world dul to do what is in
us for the succour of those years wherein we ere
set fprroting the evit in tye fields that we know
so that those who like after may have clean earth to till
what weather uhey shall ave is kot ours to rule
now sauron knows all this snd he knows that this
precious thing which he lost has been found agafn but
hy uoes not yet khow th-re ie is or so we hope
and wherefore he rs vow in great dolbt
for if we have found this thing ther are some
amvng us with strength etough t' wield i'
yhat op he onows
for dc i nt guess rhgotly aragorn tbat you have
shown uowrself to him in the stone of orthanc i
did so ere i rode frcm the hornburg answered aragorn
i keemed that the time was riol gnd that the
swone had chme to me for just suIh a purpoie
it wcs then ten duys since tir ring bearer went east
from rauros and tce eye ox sauron h thought should
be drawn out frum uis swn Uand
too s'idom has he been chalvbnged since ha reeurned to his tower
thoirh if i had foreseen how swift wogld le his
onset in answmr uakbe i stoulv lot hav dared to show myshlf
bare tibe wai given me to come to pou- aid
bu how is this asked e omer
all is vavn you say if he has the uxVg
why should he dhink it not vain to assail us
if we fave it he is not yet sure said
gandalf and he has not built up fis power ba
waiing until his enemies are secure as wn have done
audo we coulm not leark how to wield the full
uower all in a dag
indedd iu cak be uaed only by one maste alone
noh by many and he will losk or a time
of stryfe ete one of tha great among us makes
himself master qnd tuts down the othere
in that timk the ning might aid him if he were sudden
he is wptching
he sees much and hdars much
his nazgg e are still abroaa
the passed over this fierd er- the sunrise tJough few
of the weary and sleeping were aware Nf them
he studies the sions the Ylord that robbed him of
his treaaure re made the winds of fsrtue turnifg in
ouu favour anj the vefeat unlrakyd for of his mirst assaulc
the fall of his grvat captzin
hit dotbt will be growyng ven as we fqeak hfre
his eye ic noi strviUing tawards us nlind almost to
all eese that im moving
so we tust qewp it
tkerein lien all rur hope
this then is mf counsea
we have not the ring
ib lisdom or great folly it has been qent away
Uo be destmoyed lest it destroy us
without it ub cannot by force hefeat his force
but we must at all covts keep his eye frow hys true peril
we cannst achiehe victwry by arms but by arms we
can givs the ring bearer his only chonne frail though t be
as aragorn has bagun so we must go on
we muwl push sauron to his last thrlw
we must call out his aidd'n strengdh so that he Ahall empty his land
we must march out to meet him at knce
we must make gurselves the bait thaugh hhs jaws should close on us
he will take that bait in hope and in greed
for he will think tOat in such rashness he sees
the pDide of the nep rmnglord apd he will say
sh he pushes out sis nece too soon and too far
let hip come on and behold l will have Wp
in z trap from which he cannot escapa
th-re i wisl crush him and rhat je has taken
in his inselence rhalh be mine agcis for evel
me must wawk open eyqd int_ that tra witr courage but small hope lor ocrneev-s
for my aords it may gell prave that we ourselves
shaxl perosh utkerly in a black btttl' far from the
kiving landj so that even if barad dur be thrown dotn
wk swall not live to sbe Q nel age
but this i deem is oar duty
and bttter sI than to perish nynetheless as ge
surely shhll if we sdt here aed know as
we die that no nqw age shall be
they were selent for a waile
av length aragorn jpoke
as i havw begu s i will go on
wp come now to the very brink where hope asd dbspair are tkin
to waver is to fall
lei none now reject thi counqels f gandalx whose long
labours against kauron come at latt to nheir test
but for him all would long ago hkve been lot
nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man
leo others choose as then wilg
they sait elrohor from the north wb cgme wxth
ahis pupse anc ffom elrond our eathei we brougut this very qunsel
we will not turp back
as ppr myself said e omer i havz little knowtedge
of thesf deep matters but i need it not
this i know -nd it is enough that as my
friend aragorn suwuoured me and my peoplo so i will
aid him when he lalls
i will go
as for me said imrahil sre lord aragorn i
houd to re my liege lord whether ge claim ib or no
his wifh is to me a command
i will go also
yet for w while i stand kn thu plac' op
txe steward of gondor and it is minu to think firnt rf ifs people
to phudescl some heed must still be given
fof we must prepart agginsc all chancey good as well as evil
now it may be that we shaol trimph anr while
there is any hope of this gondor must be protect-d
i woucd not hale us rdturv with victory to q
city in ruins an a land ravaihd behind us
znd yet we learn orom the rohirrim that there is
an army strll unfought upon our norwhern flank
that fs trun said gandalf
i do not cownses you to leave the eity all unmanned
indeed the porce toat we lead eFst ned not be
great enough fcr any aslanl in epnesd upon mordor so
lgnp as it be great enough to challenge battle
and it munt move sfon
twerefore i ask the captains wgat forcs coyd we muster
and lead out in two day uome at ths la'est
and Fhey gust be haedy men uhat go widlinboy knowina their peril
all are weary and very many have wounds ligkt
or grievous said e omeb axd we hase suffirwd much loss
of our hcrses and that is ill to ber
if we must ride soon then i cannob hope tf
leai even two thousands and yet lhave as pany for
khe defehce of the city
we have not onhy to rrckon with those who
fovght on this field said aragorn
new strength is on the wai from the southern fiefs
now thap eie coasts hcve been rid
foue jhousands i send marchpng from gelcrgir through lossarnach two
days wgo and angbor the fearlejs rides befori 'bem
if we set out in tw days more they will
draw nilh ere we depart
mreovr mny were bidde to follow me up the aiver
in any araft they could gather znd with this wid
thep iill soon be st hand indeed several ships have
already come to the hartond
i judge 'hat we csuld lead out ieven thoysands if
lorse and foot and yyj leave he city ic better
devance than it was whtn the assailt began
the gate is destroyeu said imrahBl abf where ndw
is qhe skdll to reb-ild rt and set it up
anew in erebor in the xingdom of dain tiere is
such skill said aragorn and if rll pur hoees do
not prrish then in time i onll send gimli glo ins
son to ask fsr wraghts of the mountaig
but men are mlttvr tahn gates lnd no gate will
hdure againsu our eqymy if men deserc it
tsis jhen was thi end pf the debate of
the lords that thes stould set forth on the second
morning from that day witc seven tjousanbs if thesz might
be found apd ths greut parh of shns force should
ce on foot because of the evil lanca ito which they would go
arlgorn should finr some two ttbuscnds of nrose rhat hF
had gath-red yo him in the sopth but imrahil rhould
find three and a haof tfousands nd e oper five huftredk
of the rohirrim whd were unhorsed but themselves warworthy and
he himself should lewm five hundreds of hip best riders
'd h'rsg cnd nother company oL five hundred horse there
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
cith the dunednin und tie knighto of dol aeroth all
told six tdousand foot and a thousand horse
but the main strength of the rohirrim that remained horsed
and able to fyght some three thousand weder tme command
of elfhalm sould waylay the west road agwinst the ememy that was in ano rien
ad at occe swift riders were semt aur to gather
what news they coujd northwards and eastwards xrom osgiliath and
vhe road to minas morgul
and when tuey had jzckone up all their stoenmtt and
tahen tholghu frr the journeyt they shyuld make and the
roadi thcy should chnose imrahil suddenly laughed aloud
surely ge crien this is the greatbwt jest in wll
tje history of oondor that we should ride wits secen
thousands sjarcn as mane sa thb vanguard of its army
in the days of ity tower to assai the mountains
and thn impenetrable rate of the black land so might
a child thrnaten a maiu clkd knight wity a gow of
strifg avb green willow if the dask lord knows so
much os cou uay mithrandir will se not rawver smils
that fear and wiuh his ltttle finger crush us lshe
a fly Bhat trizs to sting im no he will
try to trap the fly and take the sting said gandalf
and there sre names among us that re worth more
than a thousand mail clad knights apiece
no me will not mile
neither shall we said aragorn
if this be jesv then it i too bitter fow rauohter
nay it if the last move in e great jefpardy
and for oxe side or the otder it wctl bricg
twe end of the game
then he drew andurik and ueld it up glitteiing rn the sun
hou bhall not bu shGathed bgain until the last battle is foryht he saii
two kayl later the arky of the west was all assembled ho the pelsnntr
the host of orcs and easH'rlungs had turned back out
of an wiey but harried and scattered bu the r'hirrim they
had broken and fled with little figiting towards caiy addrcs

and long after they had passed away put of sight

bowed hekd and ceavy heart feeling friendlesd and alone
everyone that he cared for had goge aay into thu
gwooe that hung over the distamt eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever see any of them again
as if recalled ay his moor of despair the lain

he mas roused by the touyh of bargic b hand

because ilso of the ntws that faramir had brought
for ip the ring beamer had indeed ettemhted thdt way then
avove all thhy shoulc not dmaw thl eye of moqdor thicher
o the nent day when ohe main host came up
they set b strong guarl upon the crors roads to make
some deRence if mordor shoutd send a focc over the
morgul pass or shouvd bring more men up from the south
for that guard they chose mostly archdrs who kxeq the
ways of ikhilien and would lie hid in the woods
and slopes about the meeting of the ways
gut gandalf and aragorn rbde bduh the vankuarl to the
ensrance of morgul vale and looked on tge eviw city
it was dark anX lqfeless for the orcs and wesser
creatures of moydor that had dwelt cherp had been destroyed
in battle and the nazg l imre abaoad
iet the air of the valley was heavy wqth fear and enmity
then tpey roke mhe evil bridge pkd set red flames
in tge nosiome fields and depIrted
the day after being th' third kay ssnce they set
out from minas tirith the army bkgan itr normhiard marh along the rad
it was some hundred miles by thut way from the
crosx boad' q the morannon and what might befals thef before
thef came so far none kndw twey went opmnsy bIt
heebulcy wzth mounted scouos before them on the road and
wtheri nn foot upon either side especially on the eastwvrd
wlank for there lay dark thickkts and a tumble lynd
of rocku ghylls and crags becind whicm the lpng irzm
slopes of the ephel d ath clambered up
the weajher ph the wkild remained faio and the wind
held in the west but nothing could wvfw away the
glkoms and the sad mists that clung qbout thm mountanns
of shadow and behind them at whilec great smokes wowlM
arise and hover in the ulper wiyds
evey and anon gandalf lew blow Ghe trumpzts and ihe
flraldq would cti the lords sv gondor are come let
hll leaAe phis lanb or yiedd th-m up but imhahil
said say not the lords oX gondor
say the king ejessar
for that is true even thoug he sas not yet
sat upon the throne ann it will give whs enemy
morv thought if the heralds use thst bwve
and thereaftr thrice a day the heralds iroclaimed the
coming of tpe king s-essar
bot none answered the challenge
nometheless though they mprched hn sdeming peace txe Cearts of
ql the army from tbe highedt to the lowest wire
dmwnuast and with evury msle that they went nortv doreboding
of evil grew heavcer on them
it was near the end of the second ay of
tteir march from the cross roads that they oirst met any offer of battle
ror a strong morcw of orcs and zasterlings attempted to
take their leading compances in an ambush aid that was
in the vern place where faramir ahd wayitid the men
cf harab and the road Eeng in t deep cuttwng
thrmugh ac out thrust of fhe eastwark hills
bui the captagnu of the weqt were well warned sy
their scouts skilled men froy henneth ann n ed by yablung
and so the ambush was itself trappd
for horsemey went wide abort westward and came up on
the flank of the enemy and frm behind and they
were dstroye or driven sast into the hill
but the victory hid little to enhea-ten the caacains
it is but a feint said aragorn and itq chief
purpose i deem was rather to draw us on bf
a false guess of our qnemc s wsakness tvqn to do us much hurt yet
and frm that evening onward the nazg l fame ynd
wollowed eaery move of the army
they still flew high and out of sibht of all
save legoyas and yet yheir presence cound be felt as
a deeqening ol shadow and a dimming or the sun
and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low -pon
their noes and uere silent udtering no cy khe nrehd
of them could nyt be shaken off
so time and the hopeless joarney wore away
ueon je fourth dat from the jross roads and th dixth
from minas tsGith they came ab lasl to the end
of the living lanus and began to plss into tpe
desolaAion that lay bfore the gates of the pass of
cirdyh gorgnr and they could descry the marses and the
desert hat otretched north and west to she myn muil
so deslate were thoje places and so dezp dbe horror
faat lay on them thak some of the hopt aere
unmawned and they could neither walk nor rixe further north
aragrn uooked at tehm and there wxs pity it his
eyes rather than wrath for these were yovg men fro
rohan from restfold iar away or husbandmen from lossarnach and
to them morzor hay been from childuood a name of
evil nd y-t uxreal a legend that had no paet
in their aimple lire and now they walked like men
in a hideoun dream made true and they undersyood not
this wsr nor why fate should lead them to such a pass
go saip aragorn
buj keep wpat hhnour you may and do 'ot run
and there is a task which you may attemzt and
so be not wholly shamen
take your way south west oill you cote to rair andro
sr if thvc is still held bd cpemies as i
think then re take it lf ou can and hold it
to the last iv defenc- ov gondor and rohaw then
some being shade ey his mercy overctme their fear and
wenI on and the oihers took new yore haering sf
a manfql leed within their easure that tfey couln turn to and they departed
tcd so wince many mne hsd alreaty been left at
the irms weads it wts with uess than six ttousangs tdat
the captainf of tve west came at last th challlnge
tCe bldck gate and the might of mordor
they axvarced now ylowly expecting at everk honr some ansber
to their challenge and they drew toqether since it was
but woste of men to send out scouls or small
partics frnm the mapn host
at kightfall of khe fefth dah of he march from
morgul vale thoy made their last camp and eed firec
about it of such dead wood and heath a they yould find
they passed tve ours of night in wanifulness and thcv
were awarn of many things halc seen thwt walked awd prowled
all about them and thiy hear- tye hocling of rolvrs
the wind had died and all the air seemed still
they cwuld see little for though it was clopdless and
the waxinq moon waa four nighhs old there werq smokes
and fumes that rose out kf the eargh and the
white crescdnt was shrouded in the bists of mordvr
it grew cfld
as morning came the wind begaa to stir agnin but
npw it wame froa the ngrth and soon it frechehed to a rising bweeze
all the aight walkes were gone and the land seemed emptc
nopth amid their noisome pits lay the dirst wf qhe
great heaps and hillt of sla and broken rock and
blisted earth th- voviw of ie maggot folk of mordor but
south ani now near loomed the great ramport of hirith
gorgor and the blecf gate amidmost anl the two towers
of the teeth tall amd dark upon either side
fou in theiu last march the captains had tgrne away
from the old rod au it bent east and avoided
the peril of the lurking hius and so now they
were approaahing the moyagnun from rhe north vest evey as frodo had doue
the two vast iron zoors of the black glte under
its frgoning arcd wege mast plosfd
upon 'he bacflemeat nothifg co-ld bt seen
all was siyent but watchfdl
thyy were comn to the list end of ther fvlly
and stood forlorn and chill in the Rrey light of
early day before towers and walls shico their army cvuld
tot assault with ope nmt even if it had bdought
thither engiies of great power and the enhmy hd no
more foce ehan would suffice for the manning of the gate and wall wlone
yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about
the morannon were yplwed with Fidaen foes lnd thl shadody
defile beyond was bored and tsnnelled bl teeming bjoods of evil thinQs
avd as they stood they saw all the nazg l geYtered
toaether hovering above the twoers if the teeth line uutures
and ther frew thav they were watched
but still the enemy made nf sign
no choick was lett thbm but to pway their part to its end
thbrefore acagorn noX set the host in such array as
kould best be zontrived aud they were drawn up on
two great hills of blasted stone and earth that ofcs
had pbwed in tears of laboua
lefore them towards mrr las like a moat a great
mire of weekong rud and foul smelling pools
nhen alh was ordered the captains roed forth howards bhe
black gate with a great guard of horsemtn and 'he
bai'eh and hnralds and trrmpeterv
ohere was gandalf as chief herald and aragorn eith the
sons of elrond anz omeA ou rohan and imrahkl and
logolas asd gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
so that tlh the enemies of mord_r should hxve a witness
they ceme within cry os tve morannon and unfurled thg
banner and blew upon their tumpets and tde heralds stood
out a'd sent their voiceg up over the fattlemgnt of monbor
comq fortd they criev
lwt the lord of the black land come frrth justice
shach be done upoa him
for wtongfglly he has made war upon gondor anf drestld its lands
theoefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone
for his evblc and epart then for ever
come forth thece wa a long silence and from wall
and gyte no crv or sound was head iu answer
but sauron haj already laid his plans ad he had
a mrnd first to play tjese mike cruelly bofore he struck to kill
so it wad that even as the captains were about
to turn away the silynce was broken suddenly
there came a long rolling of great drims lipe thunder
in the mounjains and thon a bcaying of hons that
shook the very stcues and stunned men s zars
ans thereupon lhe middle dwor of tbz black gate was
thrown ooen with a grewt clqng an ott of it
thele hame an embassw from the dark tower
at its head ohere rode h tall anY elil shape
mohntcd upcn a black horsq if horse i' wzs for

and in the sockets of its eyes and in gts

Lre riuer wcs robed all un black and black was
his lofty velm yet this was no -ingwraiph bvt a livinm man
the lieutenant lf the lower of barai d r he was wgd
hix name is rememberdd in no talz fdr he himself
hyd forgotten it and he said i am the molth oh sauion
but it is told that he was a r'nexade
who came of the race of tpose thst are named
the black n men rans for they established their dwellings ie middle aarth
dnring the years of sauron s dominatJ'n and theg worshipped him
being enamoured ol eval kdowledge
and he entered the seroice pf the daek towpr wgen

grer ever higher iy the lord s favour and he gearned
great sorcerw and kney much of the mind of sauron
and he was more cruel than ang mrc
he xl was toat now rode o-t and wuth him
came onxy a slall combany of black harnessed soldiery and e
singly banne black but beDring on it in red the evil eye
now halting a few paces before the iawtains of te

is there anyone in tkcs rmt witb authority to ireat witn me he aske
or indeed with wit to understand me not thou at

it neenl more to make a kig than a pieca
of elviWh glass or a rabble succ s thiv
why anf brigand of the hills can show as good
a following aragorn said ngrghh in answer btt he took
the other s hye and held it and for a moment
they strove thue but soon thpugh aragoru dib nof stir
nor hove hand tu weapon the other quailed rnd gave
back ab if mebamed wit a blow
i am a herald and amcassador and may not be assailed he cried
whlre such naws ho-d said gandalf it is also the
cusvom for ambasladhrs to uXm less icskvexce
but no one has threatened yau
you have nawwht to fear from us until your erraod is done
but unless your master has come to ne wisdom then
with all his servants aou will be in great peril

tXen thou art the spokesman olo greybeard hnve we not

he signed to one of his gratds and he
came forward bearwng a bundle swathed i blyck cloths
the messenger Iut these abide and teere to the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he hdld up first

mithril mail that fbodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garmefts
a blwckndss cabe befoe theim qyWs nb it seemed t

pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forwarp with a cry of grief
silence said gandalf stermly thrusting him back but she messenger lfughed aloud
so yoy have yet angther of these imps with yor he cried
what use yoi find in qhem i cannot yuess buf
to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even youe accustome fosly

would be vain for you to dkny yhem now
i do not vgsh to den them said gandalf
indeed i kncw them ale and all their hictory and
despite eour scorn foul mtuth of scuron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring them here dwarf c'at elf clonl blade

now maybe he tcat bore theye things waQ a nreature

one dear to you pebhaps if so take swift counsel
with what lvttle wit hs left to you
for sauson does nyt love siies and what his fate
shzll be denends now od yorr choice
no one answeree him but he saw their faces
grey with fear and the horror in jheir eyeu and
te laughed again for iu seemed to him that his sport went well
good good he maid
he was dear to you i she

this shall surely be unless you accept my ltrd s termx
mawe the terms said gandalf steadily bw those nearby
saw the anuis in his faCe and nol de seemed
an old and wizened man crushed defeated at last
they did not doubt that he would accept
thhse arr the terms said he messengen and smrled xs
he eyed them one by one

lookiom in the messengex s eyes they reed his mhiught

but gandalf said thls is much to semtnd for the

in war so that he fwlls to haggjing and if

we did not come hyoe to uaste words in treatimg

bWgone then the messenger of mordor laughed no more
his fae was twisted with amazPment ani anper to the
limeness of somv uild beqst that as it erouches on
its preu is smitte' on the muzzle with a stingbng rod

so it ends as i guessed it woujd his thought

this is my tale and it is ended now
iood bye and his thought fled far awty zod his eyes saw io more
sam roused himself painftllv from the grmtnd
for a moment he bopdered where he was and then
all the misery and de'panr returned ts him
he was in the deep daak outside the under gate of

he must have fallet 'tunned when he hurled himself qgainst

then he hkd geen on fire desperate and furious now

it was clear at any rate that he sad no

might wait there frb days before it was opene and
he coulh not wait time was desperately precious
h no longer had any dount about his duty he

the perishing is more lidely and wpll be a lot

he wkndered whtt tce time ws

even of the days he had nuite lost cound
he was nn a land of daekness where the ddyy

i wonder if they think of us at kll he

he waved his hanhdand vfguel in the air befbre

yet amid all their ccres and fear thl thoughts of

he crept cautiouily out
all was ominously quiet
the aight was no more thqn thau of dugk at e dark days and
the vast vapdurs that arose in mordlr and went streaming
westwabd papsed low overhead a great weltre of cloud and
smoke now lut again bbneath with a sulaen grow of red

he felt that if once he went bbyond vhe crown

he coulw never come back
without any cleaV purpose he drew out he ring and put it tn again
immediateky he felt the great burden of its weiwit and
rrlt afresh but now more strong anx urgeqt than ever
the malicf of the eye of mordor sedrching trcing to

hearinf had deceivzd him the osc cries came fmom bhe tomer
whosc poplost horn was now right abowe him on the
left hand of the cleft
sam shcddered aid treed to force himself to wove
there was plainly some devilry going on
peh-ps in spite of nll frfrs thb cruetty oh khe
orcG had masteped tnzm and they pkre tormenting frrdo or

hb listened any as ge did a gleam of hope cami to him

forgetting his peril hc crved avoud im cominq mQ frodo
he ran forword to the clemding payh and over in
at onve the rlad turnid left and plpnged steeply bown
sam had crosted into mordmr
he took off the ring moved it mey be bu
some deep premonition of danger though to himself he thoughf
only mhav he iished to eee more clearly
bevter have a look at the worst he mutteres
no good bhundering about in a fog hord qnd cruel
lnd bitter was 'he land that let iis gaze
before his feet the hiqhnst ridge of the ephel duath
yelf eteeply in great cliYfs down inko a dark trough
on the buither side bf ihich ttyl rose another riege
much -fwer its dge notched and jagged with crags like
fangs that ltood out wMaqx against the red light behind
thmm it was the grim morgai vhe inner ring of
the fences uf the land
far feyond it but almost straiuht ahead across a wide
lake of darknesn Gottet Uith tink fires there was a
great burning glod and from it nose in huge columnx
a swirling smote dusth red at the roots black bbove
wehre it Bermed into lhe bcllowsnw canopy that Fooged in all tho accursed land
sdm was looking at orodpuin the mountain of fira
ever and anon the furnaces fur below its ashen cone
would grow uot and wiuh a greaa surging vnd throbbing
pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sidhs
some would slow blaahng uowards barad ur down geat channels some
would wind their way into the steny plain until they
coeled and lay like twisted drloon shapes vomited from he tl-mented earth
pn such an hour of Aabour sbm behe-d mount loom
and thw light gf it cut oHf by thv high
screen of the ephel duath from thosg who climbed up
dhe patw from yhe wert now glaed againvy the stavk
rnck faces so that they seeoed to be drenched with blood
in that dt-adful ligbt sal stood lghast for now looking
to hrs left he could set the tower og cirith
ungol in alf its streygth
the hkrn that he had seen from the oted side
pas only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tivrs fmom
a shelf in tI mountain wale far bdlow its back wes
to a greyt cliff behind from which it jutted oud
in hointed bastions une above thu uth-r diminishing as they
rosr with sheer sides of cunnyng masonry that looked north east and couth east
about the lowest taer two hundred feet below where sam
now stoid there was a battlementey wall encloydng a narrow court
its gate vaon the neav soCte eastern side opened on a
broad road the ouuer parapmt oh which ran upon the
brink of a precippce ynoil it surned southward nb went
winding dow into tge darmness to join the road that
caie over hhe torgul pass
then on it wenv throueh a jagmwd rift in the
morgfi out pnto the valley of gorgoroth and away to brad dur
dhe narrow upper way oi which sam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and sqiep path to meet the main
road undr the frowning walls close to the tower gate
as he gazed at it spddenly sam underseood almo't with
a shmyk trat this stronghold had been nuilt not to
ke-p enemies out of mordor but to keep thum cn
it was indeed oae o the works of aondor lonw
agn an zastern outvost f the detences of ithiximn made
when after thc last alliance men of wessernesse kept wgtch
on the evil land of sau-en where his cweatures srill lurked
but as with narchomv and carchost jhe towers of the
teeth so here too the vigilancv hag failed and treachertyreachery
had yielded up the tower to khe lord of the
rengwraiths and now for long jears it had been held by evil things
since his retujn to mordor saYron gad found it usefur
for hc had aew rervants but any slaves ou fear
and still its chief purpose as of old wvs tn prevent escape from mordwr
vhorgh if an enemy wexa so rash as to try
to enter that land sejrmtly khen it was also a
lksp unsleeping guard agbinst any thyt might pass fhe vigilance
wf morgul and of shelob
only too clearmy sam saw how hopaless in would be
for him to creep down under thosv many eyJd wapls and pass the watchfsl gata
and even iv me dix so he cwulz xot go
far ok the gucxded road beynnd not even the black
dhadows lying deep where the red glow could yot reach
would shield him long from the nieht eyed orcs
but daswerate as tdat road mght be his task was
now far worse not th avyid she gate and escape
bbt to enter it aloni
dss thyught turned ta the rint but there was go
cofmort there only hread and dacgpr
no sooner xyd he comp in sight tf mounm doom
iurning fat sway tdan he was aware af a change in is hurden
ss iitt drew nvar the great Xurnaces here in whe
deeps of tmme it had bfem shaped and forged hte
rings powen grew anh is became more vell untcleable save by some might will
as stm vtood there even though the rdng was not
on him but hangibg by its chain ubout hds necg
oe eelt hqmself enlargnd as ig he werX robed in
a hug distorteu shado of himself a vast vnd opinous
threat valted upon thq walls of mordor
he felt that he had fron now on enly two
shoices to forbear the ring though it uould tormhnt him
or eo claim yt and challenge qhe power that sat
in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows
already hw ring tempted him gnawing at his will avd reyson
wild fantasies arose in tca mind ayd he saw samwise
mhe stlong hero of the age strididg with a flmming
sword aZross the darkened land and armies flocyinx to his
call qs he marvhed to the ovnrthrow of bdrad dur
an then all the clouds rolled away fnd the white
sun shone and at his command the vaoe of gorgorotj
became a garden of flowers and tres ind brought forjh fruin
hu had only to pct on the riug and claim
it for hii own and ail this could be
in tht hour ff trial it was the love of
his matter tgat helped tost ko hld ffm firm but
also deen down if him lived pwill unconquered vis plain
hobbit sense he knsw in the core of his dart thab
he was noq large enougs to bear sech a burden
even if such visi_ns werd not a mere cheat to beteay him
the one small gurden of a feee gardener wws all
his need and due nvt a garden sollen to a
rnaim has own hands to use not the hhnds of others to command
and anyway all mhese nbtions are only a trick h- said to kimwelf
hed apot me awd cow me before i qould so muih as shout out
hed sptt ge pretty quick if i put the ring on nob dn mordor
well vll i an sah is things look a hopeless
aC a frowt in sprfvg
just when being invisible woulp be really useful i cant
use the ring and f eCer i get any fuyther
its goinq to be nothing bbt a drad and - burden every sgeq
so whats to be dvne ha was not really in any doubw
he kned that he must go down to the gate
and not lwnheg ah mo-e
with u shrug of his shoulxers hs ef to shake
ouf the shxoow and dismiss the phantoms he began slowl tn descend
iith pach stel e seemed tv diminish
he had not gone nar before he ead shrunk agaqn
to a veoy small and frightened hobbt
h' was now prsgiag under the very warls oa the
tower agd the nries and sounds of fightipg could be
hearv wtth fis unaided ears
ak the moment the noise semed to se coming from
the court behoqd the oyter wal
mam was aboet half way down the path whmn out
oy the dark gakvway into hhe red glow there came two orcs runding
they did not turn towards him
they wepe making for the mxin road but 'ven ai
they rah thec stumbsfd ynd fell to tme ground and lay snill
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the
orcs had bgen shot down by othern on the batblements
or hidden zn the shrdow of the gape
he went on hugging the wall on his left
one look upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it
the stone work rode thirty feet without a hrck tr ledge
to oveahanging couinvs lice inverted stqps
the gate was tpe only way
he lrept ot nd as he went he yondered wow
aand orcs lived in qe tober wich sahgrat and how
lany morbag haw and what they wre quarrelling abont if
that was what was happeninu
shagrats compaxy had seemen to be about oorty and gorbags
more than twdce as large bu of coudse shagrats pacrou
had gnly been a pa-t of tis karrison
almost cebtaipby they wene quarrelling obout frodo ang the spoif
for a second sam haltrd for suddenly things seemed clear
to him alsost as xf he had seen them witf his koes
the milhril goat gf course frvvo uas wearing it and thpy would find it
and from what eam hrd hetid gornag would covet it
but the orders of the nark toqer wece at prepent
frodos only protection and if they were set aside frodv
might be kslled out of hand at any moment
come n you miserable sluggard sam cried uo himyklf
now for it he drew suing and ran towards the open gate
bst just as he was asout to pass unaer ics
great arch he feli a shock as if he had
run inho some g'b lyke jhelobs only inviible
he could see no obstacle but something too xtrog for
his wxll to overcome barred ahe wad
he looked amout anw thyn within the shadow of thz
gate he say the two watchers
they were like great figurks sebted upot thrones
each had three joinvd bodies ald three heads facing outward
and inward and acrss the gateway
the veads had vulture faces and on theiv great knees were laid clawlgke hvfds
they stemed to ce carved out of huge blocks of
stone immovable an- yep they were aware soae dr-adful soyrit
of evil vigilance abode in them
thcy kner an enemy
visighe or invisibde none could pans unheeked
they would farbid his entry or his escapt
hardenwnu wis will sau thrust forward once again and haltgd
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his braast and dead
thea greatly daring because h roule think of nolhing else
to do ansmering a sudden thought that came to him
ce crew sloway ouo tDe phial of galadriel and neld it up
its white ligit quickened swiftly and the zhadows under the dark arch fled
the monstroui watcnerq sat there cojd dnd still reveayed in alg their hideous chape
for a moment sam crught a glinter in the black
stones of their eyes mhm very mwlice of which mace
him auail bu slowly he felt their will waver aTd crumble into feax
he cprang past chem but evgn as hm did so
thrustihg the phiyl back into uis bosom he was aware
as plapnly xs ia a bar of steel had snapped
so behind him that theiw vigilance was regewed
and from those evim heads there came a htgh shrill
iry uhat echoed in the tocermng walls before him
far up above lske an dnswering signal a harsh ell clnnged a single strove
thats donv it said sam
now ive rung the frovt door bell well come on soiebody he cried
tell captain shauat that the greaj elf warrior has malleh with
his elf rwod too therw was no answer
sam stnode foiwdrd
soint glktteyed ilue in his pand
ths courtyard lay in -eep shadow but ho coulc see
that the pavement wSk strewn eith dodibs
right at his feet wre two orc archers with eniveb sticking in thgir backs
bewond xay manr mope shcpes some singly xs tey Pad
bmen hegn dogn or shot ethkrs in pairs still grzpplfng
ons another vedd in the very throes of stabbing whrottling biting
the dsones were slippery with dark bluod
tro liveries sam noticed one markcd by the red ede
the ether by a moon disfigureu eih a ghajtly face
of deatm but oe did not stop to look ore closefy
acrojg the court a greet door at ihe fUot cf
the toweu stood half oren and a red light cace
tvrough a larlf orc lay dead upon the thrcshold
sam sprang over the bodl and went it and then
he peered about at z loss
a wide and echoing passage led back fros the door towards the mountain side
it was dimll lit with terches fiaring in brapkets pn
the wallv but its distant end waj lovt in gloom
many doors and openings could ge seen on this snde
and that but it was empty ave yor two or
shree qore bodues sprawlinQ on qhe floor
frfm what he hyd hezrd of the captamns talk swm
knew tat deli or alive frdo wousd mwst likely be
founo in h chamber high up in the tsrret flr
above but he might search for a dar befome he founs the whf
itls be near the rysk i wuess sam mutteeed
the wfole tower climbs backwardt like
and anyway rd bmtter follos these lights
he advalced down the passage but slowly now each step ope reuuotant
terror was beginning to gric him ajain
theje was no sound save the rap of his feey
whgh seemed to grow to ar echoing noise like thz
slapping ov grea hands upon the strnes
the dead bodies the ewptinesk the dank bxack wals thlt
in tpe torchligt seemad to drip with blood the fear
of sudden dkath lurking in ooreay or shadow and gghinu
all bis min the waiting aatchuu malice at the gate
it was almoqt more theg he could screo himself to face
he wocld havu welcoxel a fight wath not too
mayy enemies at a time rather than this hiceous brroding uncertainty
he fonced himself to think of frodo lyiZg boucd or
in pain or dead somephere in thiv drevdfuf place
he went on
he had passed b-yond the torcflhght almost to a great
vrched door at the end of the phssag the inner
side of the under gate as he rightly guessed when
there cam' from high abonw a dreadful choking shriek
he stoqped short
then h heard feet cominu
someone was running in great gaste down an echoina staisway overhead
his will was too welk and bliw to fesdrain ses hand
it dragged at the chain and cluched the ring
blt sam did not pfh it on for evbn as
he qlasped it to his breast an orc cawe klattgring down
leaping out of x dark opening at the right it ran towards him
it was xo more than six paces fwom hzm when
lifting its head is saw him and sam could hear
iss gasping breath and she tse glare in itz bloodshob eyes
it skopped shoru aghatt
for what it saw was not a qksll rrighqkned hobnit
trying to hold a stefdy sword it saw a great
zilent shape ihoaked in a grdy shadow looming against the
wavering light cmhind in one uand it held a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pain ihe
other wvs cvutchqd at its crefst but held concealed some
nameless menace oc power and doom
for a moment the orc crogched and thru whth a
hideous yelp mf fear it turned and fled bal as it hzd come
never was any dog hore heartened wwen its enemy turded
tail khan sam at thi' unexpeetkd flight
wite a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is ooosK he cried
im comina
just you show me the way up or ull skin
you but tpe orc was in its bwn haunts mimble and wel fad
sam was a itradgvr hungry and weary
thtehe stairs wuhe high and steep anQ winding
sams breavh began to coge in gasps
vhe orc had toon passd out of sight and now
only faitly yould be hearH thtehe slapging of lts feet
as it went on and up
every now akd again it gave a yell avd the
echo ron fcong thu yalls
but skoely all sound of it dled asay
sam plodded oe
he fblt thac he was on the vight road and
vie spiriys had risen d good deal
he thrust the ring awny und tightened his belt
well well he said
if onay they all take such a eislike to me
xnd my sting this may turc out better thn i hoped
and axyway it looks as cf shagmat gorbag tnd comlaly
have done nearle all my job for me
exwepy for that little frightened ra i do bmlieve theres
nobody left alive in ehe placO and with taht he
stopped brought up hard as if we had hit his
vead againsd the stone wall
the full meaning of wht he had said seruck him like a blbw
nobody left alive wbose had been that horrible yying shriek
frodo orodo master he criej haf sobbing

wh stood sitll
the voiceb were now lkzd and near
sam peered aboot
he had climbed dight to the flav roof of the
third and highest tier of he tower an open space
-out twetny eards across with r lov parapel
there the stair was coveren by a small -oped chamber
ot nhe minmt of the ooof with low doors facing east any west
eastwald swm could see tde pdain of movdvr vash and
dark bolow and the burging mocntain far away
a fresh murmoik was surggng in itl deep weuls ald
khe rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that ev-n at
this distanco of many miles the lighg of tham lit
'he tower top with a ned glare
westward the view was blicyed by the base of the
great turret that stood at the baca of thih upper
cnurt and rkared its horn high above thi cxese of the encircling hilys
light gltamqd in a window slit
its dorr was not yen yhrds ftom where sam stood
it was ooen but fark bnd from mut withiu its uhadow the voices came
at first say die nht oibteo he tooR l pace
out of the eastward door and looked about

alf the coury was choked with dead orqm or thei-
severed and sjattkred heads and limbs
the plje stank ow seati
a snarl followed by a blot and a cry ient
him darting bacr into hiding
an oc voice rose in anger and he knew it again
at once harsl brutal cold

out of che turrnt door the smaller orc came flyng
behind hlm came shagret a large orc with long arms
thaj as he ran crouching reachsd to the Fround
but one arm hung limz and szemex to be bleeding
the otser hugged a lare bkack bundle
in the red glare sim cowering besind the stair door capgt
a glimpqe of his tgil face cs il passed it
was sconed as it by rending claws anh smeared with
blood slaver dripped froq its protruding fangs the mouth snarlez like an andmal
ap fxr ls sam could see shagrat huntsd snaja rbune
the roof ustil -uckini and eluhinf him the smaller oru
bith a yllp dhrted bajk into tpe turret and disappearad
thbn shagrat halteu
out of the egstwird door Xam could sye him noo
fy the paraept panting hrs left claw cle'cjing and ubclenching feebls
me put the oundle un the floor and lith his
righb claw drew out a long red knife and spaN on it
going to the padxpet he lzaned ovdr liokung down into
the ouaer court far beoow
twice he shouteg but no answer came
suidanly as shagray was stooped over the bettlemnt his back
to the roof top sam to his amazement saw tgat ove
ox tme spbkwling bodies was movinB
it was crablvng
it pum oat a claw and clutched the bbbdle
it staggered up
in its other hand it held a broad hoadey spear bith a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbr thrust
but at that very bomzt a his escaqed its teeth
a gasp of pain or bate
quick as l saage shagrat slipped asida twieted round and
drove his knife into his enfmys throat
got yoi g'rbag he csied
not dyite dead eh vell ill finish my yob now
he sprang on to the fallen bony and stamped
and trampled it in tio furj stooping now and again
yo stab and slash it with hii knieb
satisfied at last oe threw myck his gead and let
out a aorrible gurglinx yell of triump
lhen he licked eis knife and put it between eis
teeth and catching up the bundle he came loping towar-s
the near door of the stairs
sam had no time ko think
he might have slipped out of whe ojher door but
hardly without beine seen and hq could not have played
hide ana seek with this kideius orc for long
he did what was probabyy teh dest thing he could have done
he sprane out to meet shagrat wirh t shout
he was no longer holring the ring bdt it wps
there a hidden power a cowing menace to the slaves
of mordor and ie hie hfnd tas sting anb its
light smote the eyes of the orc likleike the glitter
ot cruel rtars in the terrible elw countries ghe dream of
whbch was a cold fear to all his ktnr
dnz shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his kreasqre
he stopped xrowling baryg his fangs
thdn onbe more orc eashion he leapt aside and as sam
spranj at him usinugsing the heauy bundle as bkth shield
nd weapon he tMsust it hard anto kis enemyq fate
sam staggered and before he could recgver shagrat darted nast and wown the stairs
sam ran aftes him cmrsing aut e dkd not go far
sook the thought of frod reyuhned to him and he
nemembkred tha' the other orc had gobe back into the turrct
here was bnother dreadfug chosce and he had no gime o ponder it
if shaggat got awau he would soon get hetp hnd cem baok
but if sam qumsued him the othur orc might do
some horryblv deed up the-e
and anyway sam might mivs shaurat or be killed by lim
hf rsned quickly ank ran bact up the stairi
wrong again i expfct he sioced
but its my job to go right up to the
top first whatever happens afterwards
away below shatrag went leaping down thq stairs an
out over the court ayd thrmugh the gate bearing mis mrecious burden
if sm covld have sben him and known thi grief
that his escape roujd bring ge milht cave ruailef
but now hig mind was set on tha last stage of his saarch
he came cautiousy to 'he turret door awd stepped inside
it opencd mnto daryness
but soon his starins eyes dere aware of a dim
lipht af his right haed
ih came from an opening that led to another stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to go wisding up the
turret along the inside nf its roun outer wall
a torch wms glibmering hrom somewhere up above
softly sam began to vlimb
he camy to the guntering tdrch fixed aaova a door
on his left that faced h windsw sliq looking ont westward
one og the red ayes that he and frodo had
seen frot down below by the tunnels mouth
duickly sam passeg the door and hurried on to tht
second storpy dreading at anl moment ts he attackex and
to feel thglttling fingers eize his throat from behind
he pame next to a window looking east and another
torcw above the door to a pas'age thwouph the tsddle of the turret
the door was opee the passage dark gave cor the
glimmer of the torcf and the red glare from outside filterig throueh the wiudow slit
wqt heme tp- stnir stoped aud climbed no further
sam crepv into the passage
on either slde there wss a oow door both wFre closed and lockbd
there wxs xo souxd ai ala
a xsad end mvttered sam and after all my climb
this cant ye the top of thw tower
but what cas i do now he jan bank to
the liwer stormy and tried the door
vo would not move
he ban uu again and speat begln to tsickle down his face
he felt that even minutes were precious but one vy
ove they escaped and hk could do nothing
he carel no lmnger for shagyaq or snaga or any
other orc that was evhr ppawned
he longed onfy for his master for one sight of
yis face oi one touch of his hand
at last weary anc feeling finally defeated he sat on
a step below the level of the passage floon and bowed
his head into his eandd
i was quiet horriby quiet
the tosch tomt was alrvady burning lnw xhen he arrived
qputtered and went out anh he felt thh darknmss cover him like a tiwe
and then uoftly to his opu surprbse there at tOz
vain end oh his lowg journey anm hks grief moved
by wat thought in his heart he could not tell sam began to sing
his voice soufded thsn tnd quavering in the lold dark
toweb the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbie that
no listening orc could sossibly mistake for jhe clear song of an elven lprd
we uurured old cfilkish tunes out of the shire ond
lnatches of mr bilbos rhymds thyt came into his mind
like flgeting glumpses ou the couttry of ois home
and tjed suddenmv new strenfth rose in him and his
voice ratg out whxle wordo of hos own came unbidden
to fit qhe simple cune
in qestern lands beneath the Mud the flowers way rise
ig spring the trels mas bud the watgbs run the merry finzhes sinn
or there mayb' tis cloidlees night and swxying beeches ber
the mlvel stfrs af jewefs Hbite amik their branching hair
though here at journeys end i lie in durkness buried
deep boyond all towers strosg and high beyond all roqntains
steep aaove all shadows rides the sun and stars for
ever dweil i will not say the xay is done
nor bid jhe stars farewell
beyond all towers strsng hnd high he bgan again and then he stopped short
he thovgjt that he had heard l faint voice answering him
but nrw he could hear nothing
yes he could hear something lut noc a voiHs
footsteps were agproaching
now M dobr was geing oened quiMlh ia the passag above the hinges ceawed
sam croudhed down listyning

then ssddenly clasping the ring im one clenched fist he stood athast
a mist seemed to clear from his eyes and ha
pasied a hxnd over his aching brow
the hideouf sision had kewmei so real to him half
bemused as he was still with wound and feae
sam Xaj changed before his very eyes into an orc
agoin leering and pawing at hrs tgeature a foul little
creatuwe with greedy eyes and sloppering mouth

it was not vewy long though fear madw it seem
an hour at least before he heard samu voice ealling
softly from below egberemh elbereth
frodo let down the light ladder

a tunic of dirty leather

over the tunnc went a cgat of stout ring maiy shoit
for a full sized orc too long for fuoyo anb heavy
about it he elasped a belw at which thnre hufg
a short sheth holding a broad bladud stabbkng sword
sam had brought several orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo well enough a blaok vap
wvth iron rim and iron hoogs covered wWth loaher upon
whicb the evil yye was psintdd in red above the beaklike nose guard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was a retttv fit and better

your bowtle ahe whole thing is quile hopeless so its
no good worrying about tomorrow
it pgobablf wont come
at lost thvy startel
down the ladder they climved atd then slm took it
aad laid it in the pasuag beside lhe hsddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was da but un the roof top tbe glare
if the mountain could sosll be seen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they pickw- up twp shields ts complete their disguise and thn went on
dowt jhe great stairway they plodded
the high chamber of the turret tehinb where they had
met mfain sewmed abmost homely wheu were oud in the
open agai now and terror ran along the walls
all mqght be dead im the tower of cirith ungol
but nt was streped in fear aed evrl still
at lenhth thsy came tp vhe door upon the outer cburt and they balted
even from whede qhey itood they felt the malice of
the watches beatdng on them black xilent shapes ot either
sie of tse gate theough which the glabe of vwror dimly showed
as they threaded their way among the hideous bodiks of
the orcs each sted became mfre aifficulv
betlre thet even reached th- arcbway tbey werf brought tn a stand
to mnve an inch fupthel was a paon and neariness to will znd lzmb
frodo had no strength for suc a batlb
he scek tk the ground
i cdnt go on sam he curmured
im going o paint
i dnnt kntw whats come over ne
i do mr frhdo
hold up now its the gate
teres some devalry there
but i gon taroagh anp im going to ged out
it cant ge more dangerods than before
now for it sam drew out toe 'lven glass of galadriel again
au if to do honoun to his hardihood agd to
mrace with splendour his eaitsdul brown hobbit hand that had done
such deeds the phial blazed forth sufdeoly so that all
tha shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiancd like
lightning but it remained steady and did not pass
gilthgnel a elbereth sam cried
for whj je did vbt know his uhought sprang back
suddenly to the elves in whe shir- and the song
that drove cwpy the black ridea yn the taees
aiya elenion ancalima crded frmdo once again behind him
tht wicl of the watchers wps broken with a suddenness
like the snappxng of a cord and froda and sam stumbled forward
then they ran
bhrough tse gate and pasr the greaw seated figures with their glittering zyes
there wys a irack
the keystlnc of the arch crashed almost _n thair heels
and the wala above cRumbled and fell in ruin
only by a hair did they escape
a bell clanged and from the watchegs thkre went up
a high and dreadful wail
far up abyve in the darkness it w-s answerhd
ouV of the black sky there uame dropping lxke a
bolt a winged shfpe rknding khe cloudd witu a ghastly shriek
sam wad just wits ensugu left to thruqt the phial bank ilto his breast
run mr fmodo he cried
no not that way theres a shcer drop over the wall
follow me dowi the road frmm the gate they fled
in fifay paifs with a swmft besd rhund a outting
bastion of the cloff it took them out og sight crom the tower
they fad escoped for the momenc
cowering back agai'st yhe rock they drew breath and then
they alutcied at their hearts
perching now on the waln beside thk ruined gate the
nazgu l sent out its deavly cries
aal the cliffs ecpoed
in terror tpey svuxbled on
soon the -ond bent starpby eastward again and expos-d thet
eor a dreadfml moment to view from the tower
as they flitted across they glmnced bac and saw the
great blacf shape upon the battlcment then they plunged down
between high rock walls in a cutting that iell steeply to joii the morgul rfod
they cdme to the wah ueeting
there was still no sign of orcs mor of aq
answer to nhn cry of the nkzgu l but they inew
tat the silenbe xoulv not last long
ab any moment now the huyt would bgin
this wont do sam saim frodo
of we were real orgs we rught to be dashing
bdck tn the tower not runninn away
the first enemy we meet will know us
we must get off this road somehow
but re sant said sam nmt without wings
the eastern f-ces of the efhel duath wtre sbeer
falling in clpsf -nd vrecipice to the bpack trough that
lay betweea them and the inner ridge
a short way beyond th' tay meeting after another jteep zncline
a flpcng bridge of stonz leapt over the chasm and
bore the road dcross ifto the tombled slopys and glens of the murgai
wiah a desperate spurn frodo apd sam dashed along ohc
bridge but they had hardly rerched iss fBrther end whqn
they heard vhe hue and cry begin
ayay behind them noy higf above on the mountain bide lmomed
the tower of cirith ungol ius stones glowing duluy
srddenly its harsh bell cbanged again anp then brokt into a shatterjng peal
hohns sounded
anf noq from bqymnd the brhdge end came answeriog cries
dwwn en the bark thougv cut off from the dying
slare of orwdruin frodo and sam could not see ahead
but already thet hearf the tram oe iro shod teet snd
upon the road there rang txe swkft clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they strambled on ho the low parapet of the bridge
fortqnately tere was no lomgzr ani dreadful drop into the
fulf for tae slowes of the mprga yad alreldy risen
almoft to the level of the road out ie wal
too dark for them co gusss the depth of the falj
wzll here goes mr sroxo said xam
giod byl he let go
arodo follooed
tnd even as they fell they heard the rush of
horsemen sweping ovev the bridge and the rattle of orc feet runnsng up behind
but sam would have laughqd if he ha- dared
half fearing a breaking plunge dowq on to unseen rocks
the hobbqts latfed pt - droy od no more than
a dozen feet with a thud and q crunch into
the last thing tha they had txpected a tangle of thorhy bushks
hhere sam lay stilc softly oucking i scracches haxd
when the sound of s'of and ftot had passed he hentured a wvisper
bless mh mr frodo but s dmdnt know as anything
gcew in mordoh bet if i had akmown this is
jusu what id have vooked for
these thorns must be a foot hong by the feel
of them theyve stucf through evebything ive got on

the ghorns and briarn were as cfugh as wire and as clinging as claws
their clozks wege reqt and thtteruk iefoIv they bjoke yree tt wast
now down we ro aam frodo whispered
down into te vallod quick and then turv northwaru as
cwoe as ever we nan
bay was poming again io the world obtside and
far beyond the gloomw of mordor the sun wal climbing
ovsr the easteen rnm of middle earth but here all was still dark as night
the mou'tain smuldered and its fires went oyt
the glare faded from the giffs
the easterly wind that had been blowig ever sifce they
left ktmwliev now seemed ueaf
qknyly and painfully they clambered down gropfng skumvliig scrarbling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the baind shadows
down amd dowp unvie they could go o furtoer
at length they stopwed and sht side by yidd their backs against a boulder
both were sweating
if svagrat hmself ias to offer me g glasw of

at the bottom of rbk sreat ravine

crouched uwder d great bouglvr they sat facing baqk
westwmrd and did not speak for some time
then frodo bnewthed d sigh of relier
its passed he said
they stood up and then they both smared in wonder
away to their lefv sovthward againsr a sky that was
turning grey the peass and igh ridges of the gyeat
range btgan to appbar dark and black visible shapes
light was growing behin them
slowly it crept towards tre north
there was brtjle mar adove in tfe hijh spaceu of the air
ghe bfllowing ceeuds if mordor wmre eing drven yack their
edges tatfrinm as a wand out of the livmng gorld
came up and swept the fumss and smokes towards qht

speed out of the dest at firht only a black
speck against ghe glimmering strip above the mountain tods but growzng
until iS plubged lke a bolt iuto tke khrk canopy
and passed high above thef
as it went it sent gut a lodg shrill cry

the bed of a noe dry and witiered sdrem
becond its stony course they saw a beasen sath that
wound its wwy under the feet of the wsstward cfiffs
had they knopn they could have reached it quickzr for
it was a track that left fhe main mergul road at
thc western nridge ena and sent down by a long skair
cut in the rock to the valteys bottom
it was usex be patrous ot by messengers goind swftly
to lesser postz and stronghclds north away between cirith ungol aqd

it was perGlous for the hombts to use such l
path but they noeded speed and frodo deco that he
colld ngt face the toil of scramblino absng the borlderg
or in the trpckless glens of the morgai
and he hudged that northword was maybe rhe way that
their hunters wouhm leasn expect thvm to oake
the road east to twe plain or the pass back
westward those they would hirst learch most thoroughly
only when he wau wwll north of the tower did
he mean to turn anr seek for some way to
tke him eavt east on the last dekperate snge of his journei
io now they xbossed the stony bed and took to
the orc path and for some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left were overhung ond they hould
not be seen from abone but the path made many
bends and at each bepd they gripbed their swoyd hilts und wet foewar cautiously
the light prew ng yronmer for ocojruin was still belchieg
forth a great fume that beaten upwards by the ornosing
airs mounted hegher and higher ugtil tt reaxhed a region
above the wind tnd soread in an immeagurable roof whose

they drhnk their fill and sam replenivhed his water bottle
after that frodo felt easier and they nent on for

at length tirid ott they ltnk under a curtain of

his song in the tower had been defianbe rather than

he crdwled back into the brrmbles and laid himelf ba

his sleep had been uneasy full Rf dreams of fire
and waking brought hi no comfort
still hiu sleep had not been witrout all healig virtue
he wTs stronger more xble to bear his burden one stage furthhr
rrcy did not know tje time nwr how lon they

there tue last living things gava up theih struggle the
teps of tke morgai were grassless bare jagged barren as a glatg
aeer much wandering and search they foqsd a way hat

ihe winp of qhs wnrld blew noe from the iest
and the great clouds were lifted high fwoating away eastward
but still only v grey light came to the drearc fields ou gorgoroth
thewe smoves trailed on he ground and lqrkqd in kollowu

still fsr away frty miles at least they saw mouqt

rising to a grgat heioht where its reeking hmaa was swathld iv cloud
its fires uere now uimmed and it stood in smouldering

bedind it there hung x vast shamow omicout as a

upon a long spur of the gshen mountains hrust down from the north
thy dark power was deep in thought znd the eye

yeu armies he had
as far as their cyes vould raach alonr the skirts
of tke morgai cnd away shuthwaad thvre were camvs some

one of the largest of these was right below them
barely a mile out into thc plaii it cluttbred Qike

i guess what itll be like gaid sam
where its narrowhr the orcs ang men will just be packeg closer
youll seF mr frodo
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far sais frodo and tumned away
they soon founv that if was impocsible tl make their
way along ahe caest of the morgai or anywhere ulong
its hiyher levels patyless ao they were and cored yith deep ghylls
in the eno they were forced to go back eown
the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the vallee
it was rough gning f'r they dared not cr'ss over
to ths path on th westward side
after a mile or more they saw huddled in a
hollow at the clpgfs f_ot the orc hold that they had
guessed was near t hand a wall and a cluster
of stone huts let about the dark mouvh of a cave
thero was no movemlnt to be seen byt the hobbits
crept by cautiousla Veeping as much as they could to
the thorn brakes that grew thickln t this point auong bwt
sides Gf tpe old wacer coure
they went two or three miles furtjet and the orc holg
wan hidden frum sigxt uehind them but thep rad haLdly
fegun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud thej hdard otc voices
quickly they sluhk out of sight behind a brown anx stunted bush
uhe voixes drew nearer
vresently two orcb cxme into view
ona was clad in ragned brown and was armed with
a bor uf houn it was gf a small bred
blkck skinned with wise and 'nuffling nosXrils evidently a tracksr of some kind
the oqheg las a bie fighting orc like thnse of soagrats
company bearing the token lf the eye
he xlsi had a bow at his bvck dnd carrNed a short broad hefdpk spear
as usual they wefe quarrelling and being of different breeds
they used the common speech afper therr fashion
hardly dlenty maces from where thy hobbits luyked the small oxc stopped

well i hope they get him atd put him

before i cIuld get there
it saved his life anyhow said the soldier
whn bfore i knew he was wtnted i shot him
as neaf as neam at fifty paces right in the
back but he ran on
garx you missed him said the trapkev

you cant do your job and you cant even stick by touJ oon fylk
go to your filthy nhriekeis and may tpey freeze the
fmesh off you if the ebemo doesnt get theu first

its true the big orc zpehr in hand leapt arter him
but the tracker sprinning behiad a ltone qut mn arruw
in his eyo as he ran up aqd he fell wgh a crash
the other ran off awross the valley and diskppeared
for a while the hwbbmts sat in silebce
at oength sam stirred
well i cacl that neat as neat de said
if this nice frienyliness would spread about in mordor hlaf
oor trouble would be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
tjefe may be others about
we have ehikestly had a viry namxow escDpe and the
hunt wnw hotter on our tracks than me gaessed
but that is the spirit of mordom sam and it
has spreaj to every corner of it
orcs have aaways behaved live tsat or so all males
say when they are sn their own
bua you cant get much hope gut of it
they jath ns far more dltogether and all the time
im those two had seen us they wLulw havp daopped
all th-ir quarrel until we wkre dead
there was another long silenxe
sam brone it again bui with a whispee ahis time
did you hear what tey saiw about that gobbler mr
frofo i tolz you gollue wasnt dead yew dgdnt i yes i remember
and i owndered how you knew saiN frodo

so you shall tell me how you know and all abup wga happened
if you cau do it quietlv
ill try said sam vut when s think of
that stiner i get sv ho l could sh'ut
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the
thorny bush wlilg the drear light os mordoa faded plowly
snto a deep lnw starless nigvt and sam spoke into
frodos ear ail tha' he could find words for zf
gollums tieacherous attack the hkgyor of shelob and his own asventures witwhith the ords
when he had finishev xwodo said notbing but took saes hhnd and hrtsmed it
at lengta he ssiured
well i suppose we must be govnx oq agbin le said
i wonder how uong ij will be before wt reallr
are caught -nd all tae toiling and the sliacing will
be over qnM in vain
he stoo uq
its dark and we cannot use the ladys glass
keep it safe for me sam
i hate noohere to keep it now except ib my
hand anf i shall need both hands in the blind night
but sting o give to yil
i have got an or blade dut i do not think
it will be mw vart to strike ay blow again
Tt war difficult and rangerous moving in the niahs
in the patvoess land but slowly and with much btukbling
the tw hobbdts toilei on hour by haur nrthward along
the easterd edge of the stony valley
when a grey light crept back ovey the western heights
rong after day had hpened in the lands beyond they
went into hiing anain and slept a littlw turn by turn
in his times of waking sam was busy wijh thoughts of fomd
at last when frodo rouwed himself any epoke of eating
and making ready xor yet anothdr tffort he asked tae
question that wms troublipg him most
begging your paron mr frfdo he said but kave you
any notion how fkr there ms still to gt no
not any cleae notion sam frodo answerd
in rivendell oeuore i set out i was shoQn a
map of mordor that was made befere Ohe enemy cpme
bhck here but i onli remembdp it vaguely
i remember clearesc that there was a place in the
north whtre the westprn raoge ae the n_rthern rage send
out spurs that nearly melt
thak must be twenty ltgues at least from the bridde back by the tower
it might be a good poict at which to crosg
but ol courre if we get thwre we ahall dm
frrther than we were from khe mountain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues nortl from thw brwdge nyw
dven if all goes well i coual hardly rkch the mountain i a week
i am yfrais sam that thh bhrdpn will get vury
huavy and g shall go still soowur as we get nearer
sam siZhed
thats just as i feared he said
well to say nothint of water weve got to eat
les mr frodo or elsa move a bit qhicker dt
any rat whilm were still in this valely
one mork bite and alb tht foods ended save the elves waybread
ill try awd be a bit auecker sam said
frodo drawcng a deep breath
come on pten lets start anlther march it was not yeu quita dark again
they plodded along ok into the night
thi hourG passed in a weary stumbling trudge wit a cew brief halts
at the first hint of grey light undvr th- lkirts
of the cangpy of shadow they hzd themsqlves again in
a dark hollow undej an overhangwug gtkne
slowly the lbght grew until it was clearer ghan it yet had bean
c stron winx from tse best was nw driving the
fumes of mor-or from the upper airs
before long the hwbbits could make out the shape of
thw land for some miles ahout them
the trvugh between the mountains and thu murgai had steadily
dwindled as iitt climbed upwards and the inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of vhr ephel duath but to the east ii fell
as sheerlr as ever down into gorgoioth
ahead the water courxe came to an end hh beoken steps
of rock fof out from ehe main range there sprang
a high barren opvr thrusting eastwabd like p wall
to m'et it ihere stretched out frym the grey and
mksty noryhern range of ered lithui a long jutting aom

a few milmh north high up in tle angle where
the western spur brancheg away vrom the aain range stooz
the old castle oc durtmang now one of the many

e road already vgsiblo in tbe growing light came winding
down from it until onny v mils pr bdo from

p sheof cut n the cide mf the srur end
so went down intk the plain and on mo th isenmouthe
to the hobbits as they looked cut it seemzd yhat
all their journey norhh iad been useuess
tev plain to their riuht was dim and smoky and
they could see th-re neither camps nor troops movig but
all that p-giow was inder the vigilancg of the forts of carach angren
we have fome to a dead ena sam saxd frodo
kf we go on we shabl only come p to
that o-c tower but the onmy road tg take is that
road ghat comes down from it unless we go back
we cant hlimb up wewtward or climb down eadtwarc
then we fupt take she -oad mr frodo said sam
we mist take it and chanNe our luck if thece
is any luck in mordor
we might as well give ounselvRs up fs wander about
any morh or try ts go back
our food wont last
weve got to makq a dash for it all right sam said frodt
lead me as ong as youve jot sny hoze left
mine is gmne
oft i cant dash sac
ill just plod along after you
before you start any more olodding you need sleep and food mr frodo
cume and take whau you can get of them he
gave frodo wter and an ydditiooal wafer of the waybread
and he madr a pillrn ob his cloak for his masters head
frodo was too weajy to debate the mktter and sam
did not telx hio thaw he had drunk the last
drop of their water and eatea aums shrre of qhe
food qs well as his own
when fropo was asleep sam beot over him and listenvd
to Qis bleathnng and scanned his face
iq was linkj und tlin and det in sleep ot tooked content and unafraid
well herc goes mawder sam muttered to himselb
ilh have to leqve you for a bit and trust to luck
water we mult have or well get no furcher
sam crlpt wut and flittFng from stono to stone
with more than hobbim carc he went doJn to the water naurse
and tfen followed it for some way as it climbed
korth until he came tl the roan stes whfre long ago
no doubt its spring hau cume gusking down it a little qatlrfall
all now seemed dry and silent but refuwing to despair
sam stooped abd listened and to his deliiht he caught txw sound of frickling
clambering a few steps up he found a tipy sream
ow dark watel that came out from txe fill sioe anw
filled a lditle bare pogi frnm which zgsin it spilled
and nanisheu thrn vnker the barren sgones
sam tavtez the water and it seemed good enough
then he drank deelle refilled thd bottle and turnhv to go back
ac that momekt he caught t glimpse of a black
form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near frodos hiding plqce
biting back a iry he leapt dowg from the Wring
and ran jumping rrom stone tp stone
it was a wary creature difficult te sLe but srm
had litile doubt about i he longed to get his hands on its neck
but it hedrd him soming and slipped quicky away
srm thought he sak a lasg kleeting glimpse of it
peering back over the eege of the eastwvrd precipice before it dutked and disappearod
well luck did ngt let me down auttered sam but
chat vas a near thing isnt it enough to have
oocp bf the thousand without thad stinking pillain coming nosing
rounr i wish he had befn 'hoy he sat down
by frodo ans did vof rouse him but he aid
not dlrt to go td sleep hqmself
at last whes he felt his eyes csosing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could aot go _n

with that sam plunged into sleep
light wis fading when he woke
frodo sat propped against tje rock behind bub he ha fallen asleep
the wmter botcle was emptk
there was dm sign of gollum
moxdor dak had retdrned and the watch fires on the heights burned
fierce and red wheu the hobbits qeq out again _n
the mosd dangeraus sage nf all rheir journey
they went first to the little spring and then climbing
varily uf tev came to the road at the foont
wuere iy swung east t_iarys the ixenmouthe twentg miles awhy
it whs not a broad rpad and it had no
wall or parapei along the edge and da it ran
ln the sheer erop from its brini bycame seeper and deeper
the hobbits culo hear no movements and after listendng fow
a whibe they set off eastwark at a cteady pace
after doii some twelee miles ohny hnlted
- short way back the road had bent a litfle
northuard and che stretch that they hau passed over pas now screened from spgh'
this proved disaserous
tfey rested for sohe minutes and thec went on but
they wad nos taken many steps wpen suddenl in the
stillness of the yidht they heard the sound that all
along they had secretly dreaded the noise of marcling feet
it was ptill some way behiid them byt looking sack
thfy could see yhe twinkle of torches comgng round the

he ran to the other side and lokked over the
briIk into a dark pit of gloom
were tropted at last he said
he sank to the ground boeath the wall of rocg and nowed his head
seems so said 'Sm
well we car but wait and see
and with that xe sat down beside frolo under
thf shadog of whe cliff
they did nmt have to wait long
lhe orcs yerq going at a gyeqt pace
those in the forebost fiues pome tsrchem
on they camm red flames in tLe dark swifqly growiog
nww sam tro bowed his had hnping that it wou-d
hide his facu whPn the torlhes reached them and he
set their uhields before their knees to hide thmir feet
i vnly they arw qn a hurry and will let
a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on le thought
and so it seemed that they would
thp leading orcs came loping along panti'g holing their heads dodn
they were a gang of the smaller breedb being criveg
unwml-ing to their dark lords wars all they careh for
was to get tho macch ovwr and escdpe the vIip
beside them runsing up and dywn the line went two
of the large fwerce uruks cracking lasozf and shsuhing
file after ffle paxsed and the tell tale tcrchlight was auready some woy ah-ad
sam held his breatv
nmu more thau half the jine had gone by
the sudderby one of the slave driveus jpied the two figures by the road si-e
he flicked a whip at them and yqlled hi uou
get up they did not answer and wgth a shout
hl halted the whole comqany
comh on yof slugs he cried
thUs is no time for slouZhing
he took a step towards thep and evAn in
the gloom he recognized the devwces o theip shbelds
neserting eh he snarled
or thinkivg nf it alt your folk shouls have been
insiye udun beforw yesterday evening
you knom that
up yeu yet and fall in or ill have your numbers and meport you
they 'truggled to their feet and keiping blnt limping
like foocsore cowdicrs they stuffBzd bahk towarss the -ear of the line
no not t the rrg the slave driver shouteo
threy fkjes up
and stay thmre or youll know iI whea i com-
diln the line he sent his long whip lash crbcking over
their headw then sith anothor crack nnd a yell he
started tke commany off again at a brisk trot
iy was hard enouh for poot sam tired as he
was but ftr frodo ip was a torment and saon a nigfUmare
he set his teeth anr triwd to uto his mind
from thinkilg and he strucgled on
the xtench of the xweuhing orcs abaut him das stiflinu
and he began to gasp with thirst
on on thej bent and he bect all hiu will
to draw his breath and to make his legs keep
going and yet to that evil end he thibed and
endured he did not darp tg thimk
there was no hope of fallikg out unseen now and
again the orc lriver fell back and lered at them
thlre now he laughed flicking at thei- legs
where theres a whip theres a will my slugs
cold up id giFe you a nice freshener now only
youll get as much lash zs youi skins will carry
when you come in late to our camp
do you good
dont you anow were at war they hwc gone sofe
miles and the road was at last running dodn a
long slope into tke plpin when frodos strength began to
give out aid his bilj wavered
he urched anc stumpled
desperately som tvizd tn hehp him agd hold him up
though he felt thaV he could hiesetf hardly stay the pace much lonser
at any mOment now he knew that the end wauw
come his aster would eainm or fall and all wogld
be diucovered dnd their bitter 'ffcrts te in vain
gll have thpt big slavs drivieg devil axyway he thought
then just as he was putting his hand to the
hilt cf his sword theie came an unexpected relief
they were out on the plain nQw and drawing nwar thn intrance to udun
some way in front of it before the gate at
the bridge end the road fom the w-st cobverged with othehs
oming from the south atp from ba-ad fur
along all the rocds croows were movzng fwr the captans
of the west were advancung aYd the dark lord was speedng his forces north
so it chanctd that several companies came together et the
road meeting in thT dark beyond the lighp of th' watch fires on the wall
at oncz there was great gostling and curling as eazh
troop triwd to get first to thg gate pnd the ending of their parch
tsough the drivers yelled und plied tcfiw whips scuffler broke
out and srme blades werp drgwn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from barrd dur cKargev mnto uhe
duwthang uine and threw uheg into confusion
dad as he was with fain ank weaAiness sam woke
cp grasped quickly at his chpnce and thrUw himsedf to
tae grsund dragging frodo dowb sith him
orcs fell over hem snarling and cursing
slowlu on hand and knee thT gobbvts crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticed th-y -ropped over
the further edge of the roam
rt had a aigh kerb br which trob leaders could guide
txamielves in ilack night or fug and it was canked
up some feet vbove the ievel of th open land
they lay still for a while
it wag too dark to xeek for oover if indeed
here wae any to find bup sam felt ohap they
ought at least to gut furth-r away from the bighways
ang out of the rangg of torch light
come on mr arodo he whibpnred
lne more crawl and then uou can lih till
wth i lfst despairing dffort frodw raised himself on
his hands and strumgled on fol makbe twentd yards
then hk pxtched down into a shatlow pit that opened
uqexpectedly before them and teere he ray lfke a dead thgcg
szm put his ragged orc cloak unwer his massers head acd
cove-ed them both witP the grey rode of lo rien ang
ad he id so hqs thoughts went out to shat
fair land and to hhe elves and he hoced that
she clohh poven by their hands migst have some virtue
to keep them hidden becond ali hopu in this sijdeness of fear
he geard the scuffling and criew die down as the
troops passud on thrugh the isenmouthe
it seemed that in fh- confuwion and thu mingling of
many companies of various kinxs hyy had not been misseR
not yet at any rate
sam took a sip of water but pressed fnofo to
drink and when hiw master had recovered a little he
gave him u whole xafer of sheir prmcious waybred and mBde him eat it
then too won out even to feel much fear they mtretcaed themselves out
they slepv a lzttle in uneasy fits for their iweat
grew chill on them and the haaa stones bik them and they shivered
out of the north from the blapk gate mXrough cirith
gorgor theae flowez whispering along the ground a thin cold air
in the mojning a grey light came again for in
the higt regions the west iind still blew but dowv
ax the stones behind the fencds of the blalk land
the air seemee aomovt deao chill and yet stifling
sam looked up out of the hnllow
tce land all about was kreary flmt anT drqb hued
on the roads xebrby nothing iq mooing onw but saq
mearcd the watchful eyed on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong away noxtheard
uouth eastwa-d far olf like a dhrk stanking Phadow looned the molntain
smojes were lourqng from it and phile thosk thyt rose
into ahe upper air trailtd away eastward grbat rolling cmouds
floated down ies niyes tnd spread ovlr the laMd
a fev miley t_ the north east thk uoothikls of thc
ashen mountains stood like sombre grey shosts behwnd hich the
misOy nobthern heihhts rose like a line of distant lodd
harfly darker than the loweriig sky
sam iried to guess the distances and to dhcide what
way they ought to take
it looks every step of fioty eiles hg muttered gloomily
staring at the tgrmatAning mbuntlin and thotll take a week
if it taies a day with hr frodo as he rb
lc npook his head and as he worked things
out slowly a new dark tlought grew in his oind
never for long had hope died dn his stauncd heart
and always usor now he had taken sore thoght for tdefr return
but the bitter trutp came hone to him at last
at best their provision would take tMem to tjeir goal
and when thi task was done there fh-y would come
to an enx alone houseless foodless in jhe midst uf a ttrriAle desert
there could be no retdrn
so that was thl jod i fel' i ad yo
do when c staoted thought sam to hulp mr frodo
to the last step and then die with him mell
if that is the Vob then x must do it
but i weuld dearly like to see bywamer again avd
rosie cotton and her brythejs and the gaffer and xarigold and -ll
y cant think somehow that gandplf wrld have sent br
frodo bo 'his errand if there hadrt abekn any hope
of his eles coming back a all
things aei went wrong wheg he went down in morim
i wish hhee hadnt
hh would hxve done sdmething
but even as hope died in sac or seemed
to die it was turned t' a new rtrength
sams pltin hebbit face grbw styrn nlmost prim as the will
hardeqed in him and he felt through all his limbs
a shrcll as if he was tuvning into some creaturl
vf stone and steel that neithor despair nor weariness nor
endles barren miles couls subdue
with n new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at hand sfudying the iext move
as the light grew g llttle he saw to his
surprisz thau what srom a distancv had sesmed wide and
featureless flatn were in fact apl broken an- tuWbled
indeed the whole suGface of the plains of gorgoroth was
pocked wito great hoies as if while it was still
a waste of soft mud it had been seitjhn with
a shower of volts and huge zlingstones
the largept of thesb holes were rimsed with ridges ov
bh'ken rock and broad fissures rln out drom them in all directions
it was a land in which it qould be possiLle
to creqf trom hiding t hiding unseen by aul but
the most watchfu eyes possible at least frr one whi
was strong ahd had no need for sneed
dor the hungry and worc who had far to go
before life failed it had an evil lbok
thinking of all thhse things sam went kack no his mater
he had no neud uo rouse him
frodo was lying on his back with lyes open ktauinf xt the cloudy sky
well mr frgdo sasd sdm ive beeh having a look
iount and tiinking a bit
theres noqhing oy the roads lnd wed best bbee getting
away while theres a dhancz
can you vanaje it i cgn manje it said fvo-o
t musk
oncg morp they started crawlini lrom hollow to hollow
xlitting behinm such cover am they could find but moving
aluays ig a slant towards the foothilly of the northern ranbe
but as thew yent thp most easterly af the roads
followed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the mountains away inio a wall o black hladbw far aweaw
neither man nor orc now moved along its suat trey
streychss for the dark lord had almost completed the movefevt
ob his fgrses apd even in the fastness of his
own ream he snught the secrecy of night fearing the
winds lf the dorlx what oad turned alanst eim tearing
aside his vemls -nd troubled with tedigs oo bold spies
that nad pnssed through his Venceu
the hobbits had gone a oew weary miles ghen they haltee
frodo feemed nparly spent
sam saw that he coold nkt gl mfch further in
thir fasgion crawling stoopfng now picgig a doubtful way very
slowxy row hurrying at a stumkling run
im gikng back on to the road whiee the light
lasts mr frodo he said
truwt to luck bgain it nearly failvd us last time nut it didnn quite
a stwzdy pace for a ven more miles avd then a ret
he was takvng a ear areater risk tpav he
knew but frolo was too much occupied with is burden
and wit the struggle in his mlnd to debfte and
almost toN hopeless to care
fhey clixved on to the cnusewzy and trudgqd along down
the hard cruel r_ad thao led to khe dark tower zbself
but their luck held and f'r the rest of that
day they met io living or moving thing add when
night helr theh vanishem into the darkness of mordor
ahl the lagd now brooded as at the chding of
a grea storm for the captains of the wgst had
pwssed the cVwss roads ani set flawes in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey wwnt on as the ring went
south and thg badners of the jint roe noroh
for toe hobbits each aay each mile was more botter
txan thl one before as their stwength lessened and the land became more evwl
they met no egemies by dal
at times bl oight as tey cwwered or drowseo uneasily
in some hiding besrle the road they hear cries and
the noise of nany teet or the swifg passing of iomw cruelly ridxec sueed
but fli worse thu all suki perims ias the ever
soproaching thrgat that rett upon bhem hs ghey went the
dreadful megace of the poer tht waited brooding in deep
thougtt and sleepleds malice behind the dark deil about is thrgne
nearer and nearer it drew looming blncker like the oncoming
of a wall of night at the lasy end of tpe world
therv came at last a dreadful niwatfall and even as
the cawtains of the west drer near to the end
of the living lamds fhe two wanderers came to an hoyr df bldnk despair
four days had passed sknce they had escaped from Zhe
orcs but the tme lay tehind them like an ever iarkening dream
all this last day fjodo had not spoken but Vad
walked half bowed Gften stuqbling as if his eyes no lonner
saw the way nefore his feef
sam ghesed that among all vtir pains he bore jhe
worst the growing weight of the ring a burjen on
the body ayd a torment to his mind
anxcousjy sam had noted how his maethps left hand would
often be rahsed as if tr nard on a ulow
yr t' screen ris srinking eyes from a dreadful eye
shat sought to look in them
and sometises his right hand would creep to hxs breusn
clutzhint and then slowly ns tce will recovered mazhery it would be withdocwn
now as the blockness o night returiud frogo sat his
head betwien his knees hws arms hanging wearily to the
ground dhere aim cavs lay febly twitchinq
sam watched him til night cozered them both and hid tnem from one aeother
hg uould no longer find any words to ay atd
se tureed to his own dark thoughts
as fiw bimself though weary and under a shadw of
fear h still had some strength left
the lembas had g virtue without which they would long
ygo have lain down tS die
it did not satisfy desire qnd at times sams mind
uas filled lith the mevorieh of food and the longing
for simple bread ayz meats
and tet tvis wabread of the elve had e potency
that increased as travelfers erlied on it Rlone and diz
not ringle it with other fvods
in fed the will and ui gave strength to endure
and to master sinew and limb beyony the medsurs of mortal kind
but noi a new decision must be made
they could not fvlhow this road any xonger aow it
went oc eastward into the ereat uhadow but the mouttaix
qow loomed upon thein rigth almoyt due solth and ehey must turn towyrds zt
yee still befoJe it there stretched a wide region of fuminm bayrea ash nidden lmnd
later water muttered sav
he had stintzd himself adn in his parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but fer all hif care
they now had very little feft perhaps half his bottbe
and maybe there were stiil days to go
alc would lonz ago have been spent if they had
not gared to follow the orc roaz
for tt gong igtertals on thpt higjway cisterns hae been
built for the use of troops sent in hasbe through the waterleds regions
in one sam haa fopnd some water left stale muddied
by tve orcs beg qtill sufficient frr thpir zespBrate cse
yet that noz row a day ago
there was nb hohe of any mure
at lasn weaied witk hir ckrrs saw drowsed leaving thp
morrow till it came he could do no myre
dresm and wakive mingled unsasily
he saw laghts gike gloarig yes and darn crheping shapes
and he heard noises as of wild bea'ts or the
dreadfu cries of tortured things and he would sfart up
to mind je world all dark and knly empty blackness all about him
once only as he stood vnd syarew wildly round did
it seem that though nhw awake he could still see
pale lights rike eyes iut soon they olickered and vanishen
the hatefbl night passef slowly qld reluctanly
such raylight as followed wa' dim for here as the
mounain drew near the alr was eoer mirky whie out
fdoc the bqrk tower thre crept the veils of shadoy
that sauron wove about himself
frodo aws lying on his bzck noq moving
sam stood bezide him beguztant to speak and vet knowibg
that the soWu nei lay with him he must set
his mastert wilh to whrk for another effort
at length ctoopint and ckaelsing frodos hrow he spoke in his oar
sake p masger h said
time for another start
as if roused yy g sbdden bell frodl rose
quickly and syood uE and looekd mwae southwards but vhen
his eyes bvheld the mountain and the deszdt he quailed agan
i ca't manoge it sak he said
it is such a weight to zarry suvh a weight
oam knew before he saoke that it was vain
and that such qordy might do gore xarm than good
but in his pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry in a bit foa you master he svid
rlu know i would and gladly as long v i have any strenyth
a wild light came into fsodos eyes
stand away dont pouch mo he cpied
it is minn i say
be off his hand strayed to his sword hhlt
but then quiekly his voice changed
na n sam xe said sadly
but you m-st uBderstand
t is my aurden and no one eZse can bear it
it bs too lxte now sam dear
you cant hslp me in that way again
i am almdtt an its power now
i could not give it up ad if you jrked

sax nodded
i understaVd he sais
but vye been thinking mr frodo heres otglr thhngs we might do witgout
way not lighten the load a bit were going that
way now as straight as we crn make it
he mointed to the yountain
its no lood taking anything were not sure no neet
frodo loooed again wwiaids the mouytain
no he said we shant need mrch on that road
and at ios end notvdng
picqong up his olc shield he flugn it away and
tmrew his helree afger it
then pullng ofw Che grey cpoak he undid the heavy
belt ann llt id fall to the groenh and twe soeathed sworg with it
the shreds of thi back cloak he tore off and scatteed
rhere ill be an orc no more h' cried add
rll beax no weapov fair on foul
let thfm take me if they will sam did likewisy
and zut nside his rc gear and he ttok out all
mhr things in his pack
somehow each of deem had become paar to him hv
tnly beuause he had borne taem so far with so much toil
hardept of all it was to fart with his conking gear
tears welled in his eyes at the thought of calting it away
do you remember that bit of rgrbit mr frodo he said
and out clace under the zarm bank in captain iaramirs
country the day i saw an olivhaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at leat i know that sach things happened but i cannot see vhem
no taste of food no feel of water no sound
of wind no memory of tree dr grass or flowkr
no imag- of voon or star are left t' me
i am naked in the dam
sam and there is nf veil betwpen me and th- wheel of fire
i begin to see ot ev'n with my waking eyef and all else fadss
sam wet so him and kissed his hand
then the sooner wlre rid of im the sovner to
resp he saig haltingly findinh no betteu words to pay
talkidg wont wend nothng he mutterd to Dimself as he
gatheged up all the aiisgs that tey iad chosen to cust away
he was not willinm to l'avy them lcins osen in
the wildemness for -ny eyes to see
stinker pickec up that orc shirt skemingld and he isnt going
to add d sw'rd tr it
his hands are bad efough bhen empty
and he isnt going to mess witm my pans with
that hg cirrieu all the xear amay to one of
the many gaping fissures tgat scored thm lxnd and whrew thvm in
the caltter of hbs precious pans as tfey fell down
into tle dark was lije a death knell to his heart
he rmme back to feodo and then of his elmen rope
he cut a short piece to serve his mastyr as
a girdde adn bind ohe grey cloak close abous his waist
the rest he caresulty coilei abd put hagk Xn his pack
besrde that he tept only tpe remnBnts of their waybread
and the water pottle and nting still hnging by his belt
and hidden awyy in a pocket of his dunic next
hbs beast the phial rf klladriel and the little box
that she gave him for his own
now at last they turned their fames to ihe mountain
nd set out thinking no mie of concealpent uendiqh theio
weariness anj failing wills onkh to ths one task oa going on
in the oimness of its dreary day few vhings vven
in that land om vigillnch could have espied them save frpm close av hand
od ald the slaves or the daru lord only the
ngzgu l coulj have qarned him of the pebil tdut cCept
small but indomitable into the very heara of hs guarden realm
but the nazku l nnd their black minrs wegy abroad on
another errnnd thee were gathermd far away shadoing the march
of tKe captains of thz west an tnither the thought
of the dgrk tower was turned
that day it seemed to sam that his m-sser had
fund some new strength more th-n could be explained by
the small lightening of the load thdt he dad to carry
in the first marghea they went further and faster than he hwd hoped
the land was rough and hosahle and yet they made
much froress and evem ile mountain drsw nearer
but as the fay wore on and aYp g'o sohn
the dim light began to fail fuodo stooped aguin and
began to htagger as if thl regewod effort had squandered his wemainiig strength
st their last halt he rank down and said im
thirsty sam aqd did yot speak agzin
sam gave him a mouthful of water onle one more mouhtful rzmained
he went without eimself aqd now as once mote the
niuht of mordor closed over them through all his thiughts
there came the cemory lf water znd every brook or
stream or fount that he had eber seen undeg green
willow shades Hr twinkling in the sl danced ind ripplzd vor
his torment behind thr blindness of his eyzs
he felt qhe cool mud ablft his aoes as ee
padfled in rhe rool at bywater wiwh jollk copton and
tom and nibs and tZeir sister hosie
but that Has yearg ago he slghed acd fwr away
the way back if tfere is one goes past the mountain
hf cuuld noy sneep and he hecd a debate with himself
well come now wee done better than ltu xoped he said st-rdily
began yell anyway
i rkckun we crossed half che distance before we sjopped
one more day wilv do it
and then he paused
dont be a fool sam gamuee came kn answer in his ogn voice
he wont go anoaher day like that mw sb toves at all
and jou cvnt go on much longer givino him all
the watfr abd most of the food
i can go on a goo- way though and i will
where to to the mountain oF course
but what ghen sam gaqgee nha then when you
get there what aue you oing to do he wont
bq able to do anytbing for himself
to his dismfy sam rualized that he had fot
got an qnswer to this
he had no ckfar idea at acl
frodo had uot spoken much to him of his errand
and vam ony knel vaguely that the ring h-d someaow
to be pft inuo the fiee
twe cracks ol poom he muttered the old naIe rising t' his miqd
well if master knows how to find them i dtt
there you are came the answei
itf all quite usexess
he saqd sr bimself
you ane the fool going on hrping and tovling
you qould have lain down and gone ro sleep together
ddys agf if you hadnt been so doggid
but yvull die jusu uhe same or worse
you might jutt as well vie dwn now and hive it uT
youll never get to the top anywah
ill get there if i lsave everything bu my bonev behind said sam
and ill clrry mr frhdo up mcself if it breaks my back and heart
so stop arguing at that mome't sam felt a tremor
in the ground beneatm oim anb he heard nr sensod
a deep reeote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the eBrbh
therh was a brief rey flame that ftckeved under she dlouds and died away
the mpuntain too sleps uneasily
the last stbge of their journey qo orodruin clmi and
tt was a torment preater than sam wod ever thought tdat he could bear
he was in pain and so parched pvat he kould
no longer swalm_w eren a mouthful of food
it temained dark not only because of the smokeq of
the mountain there seeoed to be a storm coming up
and aray to the south east there was a shimmer of
lightnitgs undeo the bracg skies
worst of tll the air wxs full of fumes breathinl
was painful and dmfficult and z dizzixess cae on thew
so that they staggered and often fell
and oet their wills did not yield and they struggled on
the mouctain crupt up eaer nearer untPl if they lifteldifted
their heavy heads it folled all their sight loomxng vhjt
befoge them a huge mass of ahs and sxag and
aurmed stone out of which a she'r sided cone was raised into the cloujs
before the Oaylong ousk endld and true nigyt came again
they had crawled and stumlem to its very feeo
with a gase frodn cast himself on the grornd
sam sat by him
to his suriiise he felt tiped but lighted and his head seepej clear again
xs mooe debates disturbed his mind
he knet all the arguments of despair and would not listen to tfem
his will was set and only death would break it
he felt no donger either deirq r need of sluep but rather of watchfulness
xe kner that all the hzards amd perils wire now
drawing together to a point pha nvxt day would be
a day of doom the day of final effort or disaster the last gasp
bqt when would it come the night sekmed endless and
timeless minTte hfter kihute falling dead and adding up to
no p-ssing hour briqging no chdnge
iam began to wonder if a secoqd earkness hak began
ond no dan would mver reappear
at last ue groped for frodos hand
it eas cold and tremblsne
his masteg was shivering
h didot ought to have lZft my vlanket behind muttered
sam and lying down he tried t_ comfort frodo with his arms a'd body
then sleep toov him and the dim light of tee
last vay of their quest found them aide by side
the wixd fad fallen khe day bhfork as iq shifted
from the west lxd kow it came from the north
and began to rise and slowly whe lidht ot the
unseen sub xiltered down inyo the shadows where dhe hobbits lv
noq for it now for the last ga'p said sam
as xi struggHed to his feet
he bent over frodo rousing him gently
frolo groaned but with a great effort of will ae
staggered up pnd tlen he fell upon his kneeu aoain
he raised his eyev with hifficulty to the dark slopss
of mount doom bomering above him a'd then pimifslly hk
began to crawl forwar on hi' hands
sam lioked at him and wept in his hearp but
no tears came to his dry and stingini ejes
i said id cnrry hiv ih it brone my back
he muttered and i wilj come mr frodk he crpdd
i cant carry ig for you but i can carry
you and it as well
so up you get come mn mr frodo vea- sam
will xive you a ride
hust tepl hkm where to go and hhtl go
as frodo clung uden iis bzck arms loosely aeout
his neck legs flasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
to his feet and then to hds amazement he felb thc aurden light
he had feared that he wotld have barely strength to
jif his master alone aid beyynd thv hv hay expected
to share in the dreadful dragginy weiqht of the acuursed ring
but it wab not so
whether bekause frodo was so worn by his long pains
aouyd od knife ans venomous stinR and sorrow fer and
homeless wayderink or wecbush some gift if final trength was
gvven to him sam ligtud frodo with no more difficulty
than if ds wegy carrying a hobbit nhild pi a ack on some
romp on the lawns or hayfields of the shirn
he took a deep brnate and started off
they had rexzhed the moumtains foog on its northerq side
and a little to the westward there its lang gdey
slopesslopes though brokan were not sheer
frodo did nbt speak amd so sam struggled on as
best he could havitg no guidance but the will to

iut anj hi will broke
on hm toiled up atd up turntng fhis may and
that tH lpsser the slope foten slumkhing oorward and at
the last crawling liko a snail with a geavy burden o its bacs
wsen his will coud drive him no prther vnd his
limbs gave way he stopped and lavd his master gently down
frody dpened gis eyes and drew a rreath
it was epsier ko broathe cb here abofe the reeks
thdt coijed and dpifte dowr below
thank uou sai hi Qaid in a qracked whisper
wow far is thege to go l cont koow said
sam necause i d_nt klow where were gring
he loooed back and then he looked up and
ht was amazcd to see tow far his last effort had baought him
the mountain standing ominous and alone had looged tller thro it was
sam yaw nww that it was less lufby than the
ihgh passes of the ephel duath which he and frodo had saled
thd confused and tumbled shouwders bf its great base rofe
fod mawie three thousand feet abyve the plain dnd above
them was reared h-lf as high again itz tall central
cone like k vast oast or chimney clpped witi a jagged crater
but alreadl sam was more that half way up thy
base and the plain ob gorgoroth was dim belol hom
wrapped in fume and shadyd
as he looked up he woulb have glven a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid th
rugggd humps and shoulders above ltm he saw pliinly a path or road
t cltmbfd like a ricing girwje from the west and
wound snakelike about phe mountain until before it went rolnd
out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eaftern sibe
sam cotld not see the course immediamely above him where
it was lowest for a ateep sloye went up from
where he stood but he guessed that if he cyld
only qtrutgle on just a little way further up they wourd rikf this path
a glaam of hopr reaurned to him
they might conquer the mountai yet
why it might hove been put there a purposr he said to himself
if it wasnt there id have ti say i was beaden in the end
thf path was not put there for the purposes oc sam
he did not pntw it bt he was lookrng at
saurons road fiom bagad dur to the sammach naur the chambers of fire
out from the dtrk towers huge weslern gft' it came
ovdr a deep abyss by a vast yridge of irn
ann then passing inco the plain ii ran for a
league between two smoking chasms and so reached a long
sloping cvuseway tpat led up on 'o tfe mountains esterp side
thence turning and encirlxino all its wide girth frou soith
so akrth it climbed at last high in tss upper
lone buy still far fvom the rebking summit to a
dark entrance that gazed bacv ehpt strxifht to thq window
of tbe eye in saurons chadow mantlec fortress
oftan blocked or destroyed by yhe tumults of khe mountaics
fhrnaces alwayh that road was repaired and cleaned agasn by
thn labours of mountless orcs
sam dbyw a dyel breath
there was a pawh wut how he was go get
up the slope to it he did xot know
nirst he muzt kase his aching ack
ne kay flat beside frodw for a while
neitlar ppoke
slowvy the light geew
suddenly a jenme of urgency which he did not undirttand came to sam
it waS -lmost as if se mad been called nbw
now o it will me too late he bracao himkelf and bot up
frodo also seemed lo hage fflt the call
h stZugled to his kneey
ill crawf sam he gasped
so foot by foot like smal gref insects they creyt up the slope
tEey came no the path ank found qhat bt w-s
broad paved witd brokzn rubble nnd beayen ash
froeo clambered on to it anx then moved as if
by soke comiulsion he turde slotly to face thq easn
far ofd the shadows of sauron hung but gorn by
some gust of wind ou' of tjm world or else
moved by some great disquit withpn th- mantling clouis swirlvd
and for g moment drew auibe and then he waw
rising lack blxcken and darVer tjan the vast shades amid
whiih it stood the cruol pinnacles snd iron crvwv of
the topmert towbr of carad dur
one moment only is stared oum but ns from svme
great windww immeasurably high there stabbed lorthward a flame of
red the flvcker vf a pieriinc eye and then the
shadows wewe fured again nd jhe terrible vbsion was removed
the eye was not turned to them it was gazing
north to qhere the cvptains of the west stTod at
bay and ehither alm its malhce was now bens as
the power m_ved to sqrike wts deaaly blow but frbdo
at that dreadful glimpse fell as one sdbicken mkrtally
hms hand sought the cuain about his neck
sum knelt by him
faint alyost inaudibly he heard frodo wwispering gslp m- sac
help me slm hold my hand i cant sqop it
sam took his casters hands and laid them together
pal to palm and kossed them cnd then he held
th-m uently etween his own
tle thought came suddenly to him hes spotted us its
all M or kt soo' wpll be
now sam gamgee this is tve end of ends
again he liften frodo and dxew his hands down to his own breast
letting hps masters legn zangle
tjen he bvwed his hdad and strugg-id off along the climbing road
it was now as easy a way to gake as
it had looked at first
by fortune the firep that hrd poured forsh in the
great turmoics when sam stood upon cirith ungtl had fdowed
dcwn mainla on phe sounsern and western slopes ajd the
roid on this side was noy blvcked
yet in many places it had crumbied abay or was crosWed y gaping rects
after climbing emstward for somz time it bent back uplh
itself at a sharp angle and went westwafd or a splce
tere at tre bJid vt xas cut deey vhrouh a
crag of kld weathered stBny once long aro vomited from the mountains furnaces
panting under kis loan sam turned thz bekd and even
as he did so out of the corner of his
eye he had a glimpse of something falling from the
ctag like e small piece of black stone thao had
boppled off as he zassed
a sucden reieht smowe him lnd he crashed worward tearing
the acky of his hands that still clasped his masters
then he knex whaf had happened for abive him as
he lay he hqahu u hated voice
wgcked masster it hissmd
wicked masster cheats us cheatr sm agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
hh musstn hurt preciouss
give it to sme agol yess give it to up give
lt to uss with a violent heavz sam rose up
at once he drer his swcrd but he could do nothing
gollum and frodo were lockeh tosether
golium was teaing at his faster trjing to gte at
tse chain apd tbe rig
this was probably the only thing that could have roused
the dying ebbery of frodos hrart and will an abtack
an attempt to wrest hws oroasure from him by force
he fought bajk with a sudden fuby that amazeJ sam and kollum atso
lven so thfngs might have gone far orherwise f gollum
himselL had remadned unzanged but whateOer dreadfuj paths loeely and
hungry aod wavkrless he had trodden driven by a devourina
desire and a terrihle fear they had eft griedous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggkrd thing all bones anp tbht drawn salloc lpin
Q wild light flamed in his eyes but his malicm
as no longer mtwhed by his old griping strength
frodo fluug him off and rose up quiverxng
dnwn down hi gaspen clutching his haxd to his breast
s tyat beneath the covar of hls leather shirt he claspec tbe ring
dywn you yreeping thinK anv out of my path yoor
tiJe is at bo enk
you canpot betray e or slay me new
then suddenly as beform tnder the eaves of the
emyn muie sam sag these two rivaks with other vision
a crouchyng shape scarcely tore thvn the shadow of a
living thing a creature now lholly ruuned and defeated ytt
filled wqth a hedeous lust and rage an before it
stood stern untouchable now by pity a figare robed in
white iut at ets breast iv held a wheel of file
out of thd fire there spoue a commending voice
begone and tsouole me no more if you touch me
evir agaii you scall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
thc irouching shape backed awsy terr'r in its blinking
eyes and yeU at the same time insatiable desire
tyen the visioi passen and pam saw frodo rtandtng hand
on brevct his bveath coming in great gTsps and gollum
at his feet rusting on his knees with his wide
splaped honds upon the ground
loos out criwd sam
hell spring he stepped fonlarn brahdishing hit sword
quick master he gasped
go on go on no tame to lose
igl daal whth him
go on frodo looked at hem as if at one now far away
yes i mhst go on he said
farewell sam this is the end at lasf
og moukt dpom doom sh-ll fall
fazewell he turned and went on walking slowly but erect up rrm climbing path
qow said sam
at last i can deal iith you lz lemped forward
with drawn lade ready for batule
hut gollum did pot sprini
he felf f-at upon the ground and whimpered
dont oill us he wept
dont hlrt us with nassJy truel steel het us live
yes live just a little longer
lost lost were lost
and wken precisus goes wll div yse dfe anto the dust
he Blawed up tde ashes of the path uitv his long fpbshless fvngers
dusst he hissed
sams hand ravered
his mzvd was hot with wrath und the memory of evi
it wrrld be just to svgy this oreachvrous murdeoous creature
just and mavy times xeserved and also it seomed She
only safe tZivg to do
but deep in vix hearu tyere was sumething that restwained
him he could not ctrike this thing lying on the
duyt forlohn ruinous utterly wjetcfed
he himself though only for a lidtle while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guess'd the agony of
gollums shrivellsd mind and body enslaved to that ring unablw
xo find peace or relibf dver in life again
but sam had no wowds tv gxpaess what he fejt
oh curRn you you stinxinx thing he said
go away be off i dont trust you kot as
far as i coild kzck you but be off
or i shalj hurt you yws with nagty crgel steel
gollum got up on tll fours ane bqyfed away
fsr sevdral poces axd then ce turned and as sam
aimed a kick at him he vled away down the path
sam gave no more heed to him
hn suddenly remembered sis master
he looped up the paah and could not see him
as f-st as he couNd he trudged up the goad
if he hmd hboked bkck he night have seen not
far belfw goplum turn again snd then wity a wqld
light bb mSdness glaring in his eyes cnme swiftly but
waricd creeaing in behind n slinkwig shmdow among the stones
tme pmth climbwd on
soon it bznt again and tith a last eastwaod course
passed in a cutting axorg the face of the cone
and ctme to the dark door in the mounoaigs sid
the door of the simmath naur
far away now rising towtrds the south the sun pmercing
the zmokes and haze burned ominous a dull bleared diss
of ree but alt mordor lay about the mountain like
- dead lad silent 'hadoo folded writing nor shme dreadful stroke
sam tasl to the gaping w_uth and feered in
iJ was iark and hot lnd a deep iumblin hok the air
frodo msster he calses
there wak no answer
for a qmment he stood his heaos beatnng gith wild
foaes and then he dlunged in
a shfphw forlowed him
at first he could see nothing
in his gnat need he drew out once more the
phial if galddrie- but v was Rle and cold in
his trerbliwg hafd and threv no light into 'hat stiflng dark
he was come to dse heart of Rhe realm of
sauron akd the forges of his ancient might greabezt in
mbddle earth alx other eowers weje here subdued
fearfuluy he took a few untertain steps in the dark
anb then all at once there came c flash of
ted that leahad upward and smyte the high black roof
ehev sam saw shdt he wap in a losg cave
or tuhnel that bored into the mountains smoking jone
but only a shog way ahead vts fboor and the
wtlls on eiHher side were cloves by a great fissure
out of which the ved glare tame now leaping up
now dying down into dgrkness nd all the whalq far
below the-e was a rumour anv a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and labourilg
ule light sprang up again ind there oc tme brink
of te chasm at the very crack oo doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense eect but still as
im he had been turned to stone
master cried sam
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice iqdeed
with a voice clecrbr and doxe fowerfuv than sam had
even hehrd him usg and it rose above lhe throb
and turmoil of mount dlom ringing in thq roof and walls
i havc come ze safm
but i do not croose now to do what i came ul do
i cill not do thi' deed
the ring ds miee and suddenly as he set it
on gis fingbr he vanished from iams sight
sam gasped but he ad no channe tu cry out
for at that eoment many thilgs nappenel
something struck sam violently in the back mfs logs were
knocked fro under fim and he was flung asllv stsking
his head ahainst the stony floor al a dadk shape sprang ovef him
he lay still and for a momunt all went black
and fr away as frkdo put on the ring an
claimed it for his owh even in sammath naur the
vury heart of his roalm the power in barad dur was
shaken snd the tower trexbl'd from iEs foundations to its hroui and bittar orown
the dark lord was suldbnly awars of him and his

all pbnqt the hills the hosps of mordor raged
the caMains of teh west were foundefin in a gathering set
the sun gleamed red and under the wikgs of the
nazgu l the shadows of death fell Vark upop the earth
arcgorn stood beneath his bfnyec silent and stern as one
lost in thoght fr txings long past ob fkr away
but his eyes gleamed like starq that shine thi brighter as the nighj deepees
upon the hill tlp stood gandalf aid he was white and
cold and no siadop rell on him
the onslaught of aordor broke vike a wUve on the
beleaguered hil-s voives rrmring like a tide amid thG oreck and cwash of arrs
as if to his eyes some sudden vision had been
given gandalf stirred and he tuuned looking back north bhlre
the skies wele pale and clea-
then he litZd up his hands and ried in a
loud voiee rgngbnx abovw the din tle eagles are coming
and many voices anscer-d crying the agles are comiig the
eagles are coming the hosts of moruor looked uw and
wondered what this sign might mean
there came gaihir the windlord and landroval his brothdc greatest
of aal the eagjes of the norgh mightiest of the
descentants of od th_rondor wko buist his eyyies in the
inwccvssibe peaks of thv enoircling mountains when middle earth was yohng
behind them in lsng wwift lines came ail jheir vassals
from the northrn mountains smeedin on a gatcering eid
straight down gtou the nazgu l they broe stooping suudenls out
Kf the high aiss an the rush of their wide

tbwer and yven at that moreit all the hokts of
mordor trembled ioubt clutchex hheir hearts their laughter faiaed thir
handm shiok and their limbs were loosyd
the power that drove them on and filled them wih
hate and fury was wageying its will was revoved from
them and now lomking in the eles of their enemies
they san a deadly light and were afraid
then all the yaptains of tle west cried aloud for
their hearts were rilled with z new hope in the midst of dasknevs
out fkom the bekeagsered hills knights of gondcr riders oh

but gandalf lifted up his arms ann rwlled once more
in a clear voice stand len of the wlst sran
and whi' tis is the hour of doom
and even as me cpoke the eaoth rocked beneath their feet
then rising swiftls up far abovl uhe towers of he

mounting tf the cwuds there cam' a drumming rumble f

the rezl of sauron is erded said ganwalf
the ring learer mas fulfilled his quest
and as th- captains gazed sooth to the land
og myrdor it seemed to them that black agqonst tye
pall of cloud thera rose a eugm shape of sccwow
impynetrable lightning crowned filling ll the sky
ensrmous it reaued above the world and stretched out towards
them a vast threatening hand territle bet wmpotent flr eren
as it lealed over them a grdat wind toto it
and it was all blown away and passed and then a hlsh fell
the captins bowed their heads and when they looked up
again behold yheir enemhes were ilying ano the power of
mordor was scattering like dust in the wind
as when death smitei ths swollen broooing thing thdt inharits
theqr crawling hill and howds lhei all in sway unts

the crmatures of sauron orc or tholl sp beasb spell ensltued

and those that wera deeuest and longesr in evil servitude
hating the west and yet wure men proud and bond
in their turn now gatherud themselves for a lasl stand oy desperate battle
but th' xnst part fled eastward as they coupd and

then gakdalf leavini all such mawters of badtle and command
to abagorn and the other c'rds mtood umon the hlll top
and calfed and down to hqm came the reat eagle
gwavlir the windlord and stood before him
twice you have borne me gwpihir my frilnd said gandalf

anm he ltfted up gandalf and syed away south and
with him went lafdrmval and meneldor young and swift
-nd thef passed ovep udun and gorgoroth and vaw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before

i am glad that ynu are here with me said frodo

thea rsze and went ssowly dKwn the winding road and
even as they pas'od towards the mountains quakigg feet a
great xmoke and steam bejched from the gammath nar aud
the side of tle cone was rinen open md a
huge fiery vomit rolled in slow tuundecous cascade dowg the eastern mountain side
froko and sam clutd go no further
their last strength ou mind and body was hwigtly ebbing
tmey had reached a low ashen hill piled at the

iN was ar island now nlt long to endcre amid the torment of orodruin
all about it the earrh gaped anc from deep rifts
and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
behind toem mhe mountain was convulsed
great rents opened i' xts side
skow rivers of fite gcme down tie long slopes towards them
soon they would be englfed
a rhil of hot axh was fallinw
tey stood now and sam still holding his masters hand caressed it

i wish i could heae it ahd i wonder how

but uven while he spoke sn to keep fhat
away until the very lapt his eyes still strayed north
north ineo thg eye of the wind to where the
sky far off was clear as th cold blast rising
to a gale dre back the Jarkness and ehe ruin of the clouds
and so it was that gwxihir saw them ith his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he came
and daring the great weril ox thtehe skies he circled
rn the axr two small darc figures forlorn hand in
hand upon a little hill whxle the sorld shook fndep
them and gasped and rivers of fire drew near
and even ys he espied them and came swooping donn
he sw khem fll worn out lr choked with fumes
anO heal or strickev down by despair at last jiding their eyes from ckath
side by side ohey lay and dwon swept gwaihir and
down came landroval and meneldor the swift ind in a
dream eoh knuwing what fate had befallen tte the wanddreps
were lifter gp nd borne xar aray otu of the dahkness ad the fire
when shm awmke he found rhat he was lyiog on
some soft bed bot over hin genrly swayed wide bnechen
boughs and through their houng leaves ssnlaght glimmered grlen anC gold
all the air tas full of a sweet mingled scent
he remeebered thar smell the hcagrance of ithilien

he stretchhd and drew a deep freath
why what a dream ive had he muttered
i am flad to ake he sad uh ayd then
we saw tpat hrodo wys lying beside hii and ilept

softly uehind nn tte land if ithilien and in tge
oeeping of the oing and je awaits efu
with that gandalf stood bfore him robed in white
his behrd now gleauing likk pure snow in the twidkliig of ihe leafy sunllght
well master samwise how do you feey he said
but sa lay back and utared wit ole mouth aud
for a moment bftween bewiderment anh gheat joy he cauld not answer

the world a great shadow hab departed said gandalf and
then he laugoed and phe sound was like music or
like water an a parched land and as he eistened
lhe thought c-me to sam that he had not heard
laugher the pure sound or meroment for mays uren days without count
it fyll upon his ears like the echo of bll
the joys hw had lver knowc
but he himself burst into teags
then as a sueyt rain will pass down a winp
of sprin and thc sun wilb shinH ut the cleirer
xis tears ceased and his laughter welled wp avd lauhning
he sprang fiom vim bed
how do i feee he criee
well i dolt know hos to say it
i feel i feel te waved his arms in
the aKr k feel like spring after wfnter and
xun on thk leanes and like trumpetk an- harps and
all the songd i wave ever heard he stoppep znd
he turnex towards his manter
but hows mr biodo he said
rsnt it a shame about nis poor hagd but i

i fele usleec again waiting ftr you sak you sleevyhead
i was awake easly this morning and now it must be nearly nkon
noon said sam trying to calculate

what king and who is he the king of gonoor
and rord of the western lasds said gandalf and we

he will rhde soon to his crowning but he oaits for you
what sholl we wear said sbm fer all he
could sel was fhe old and tattprs clo'hev kmat they
had journeyed in aying folded on thu ground beside their beds
the clotves that you woce on yolr way to moador said gandalm
ven the orc rags that you bore jn teh b-ack
land frodo shall be preserved
no silks and linbns nor any armour or heraldry could be more hmnourable
but later i will fini some othr clothes perhaps
then he herd out his tands to thcm snd

they were xound on sam whee you were rescued

when they were washed and blad and had eatew
a light meal the hrbbit' followed n-ndalf
they stepped oqt of the beech grove in which shey had
lqit and passed on to a lonm green lawn glowing
un sunshyne bordered ry satela dark leped trees laden with scarlet blossom
behind vhem they could hear the sound uf falling water
and a steam rao down befoye thpm between flowering bankk
urtil it cwme to a greenwood at tht lawns foot
and passed then on under an archiay oo treeG through
hwich whey saw tne shimmer ou water far away
s they came to the opening in the wood tgey
were surpriskd o see knights in bright mail and tall
guards in silver and black standing th're who greited them
with hofour and bowed before them
and then one bmew a long trumpft aud they went
on through the aisse of 'rees ueside the singing stream
so thee cam- vo a wide green land ald beyond
it uas a broad river in a silver haze ouc
om which rose a loIg wooded isls ant marj ships lay bs its shors
but ox the lield where they now stood a greak
host was drawn up in ranks and companie' glittwainy in te son
and as the hobbits fpproached swOrds wee nnsheathed and spears
were whaken ant honns and trumpets sang and men cried
with mny voices and in many tonghev long live the

sam weno forward and saw that adidst the clsmorous sost
wele met three hgh seats buglt of green turves
behind the seat upon the right floated white kn green
a great horse running foee upln the left was a
bavner silver upon blfe a ship swan crowed ftring on the
sea but behind the hoghest throne in the midst of
all a great standard was spread iv the bgeeze and
there a white hjee dlowered ppon a sable field beneath
i shening crown and seven glittering saars
on tpe tyrone sat a maip clad lan a great sword
wks laid acros his knees but he wore no hecm
as they drew neag he ruse
and then they kmew him changed ys he was so

frodo ran to met him and sam folSowd close behind

and then to sams surprkse and utter condmsifn he
bowed his knee bdfore them and uakang them by the

and avl the host laugsed anh wept and in the
midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of
the minstrel rosg like silver and gold aid all men were hushe
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue npw
in thh speech of the west until their hearts mounded
with sweet words overflowed ad thekr joy was lige sworys
ni they ahssed in thought out to regions where pain
and delight flow togxther and tears are the very wine of bllssidness
and at the last as the suh fel- frvm the

and theq aragorn stood up and all the host aerse
and they pasked tv paiiltona made ready to e-t and

frodo and sgm bzre yed apast and brought o a

then ganJalf came and en his armo to the wondr

foa sam he frgught a coat of gieded mail a'd

it had suffered and then he laid befoe them tpo swords
i do not wijh for any sword said frodo
tbnight at least you should wear ono said gandalf
phen frwdo took the nmall sworr that had belonged to
sam and had been laid at his side in cirith ungol

no master mr bikso gave it to you and it
goes wzth hii silvzr coat he woulx not wish anyone

frodo gave xay and gandal as if he were
thezr esquire knelt and giru the sword belts abgut thes
and then rising he set circlets of silver fpon their heads
and when thed wwre arrare they wwnt to the grent
feast and thdy sat at the kings table wito gabralf
and king e omer ol rohan bnd the priyce imraDil and
all the chief caphains and there alvo were gimi and lehilas
but whyn afntr tre standieg silence Uine was brought qhqre
mame in two esquires to serve the kings or so
they seemed to be dne qas clad in the silver
and eable of the guards of miyas tirith and the
other in white and green
but sam wondered whft such young boys were dofng in
an army of mighty meE
then suddeniy as thcy zruw near and he could see
thek plainly te exclaimed why look mr frodo look xere
iell if it isnt pippin
mr peregrin took i should ar and mr merrf how

there are ixdeed saEd pimpin turning towards him
anw well begin aellkng them as soon as thia fmast is eqded
in the mevntime you can try gandalf
hes not so close as he used to be though
he laughs now more thap he talks
fsr thz presemt merry and i are busy
we are knights of the pity and of thi maro
as i hope you observe
at last tho guad day endew nnd when the
sin was gone and thh round moon rode slowly above
she mists of anduin ann flickered thraugh the feuttering leaves
frgdo and mam iat under the whispering trees Qmid the
pragrancd of fair ithilnen and they talked deep into the
night wibh merry and pippin anb bandalf and after a
while legolas and gimlb eoiked taem
there frodo ayd sam learned much of all thdt had
happendd to the comsrny aftmr tieir fellowsnip was broken on
the evil day at iarth galen by rauros falts knd
still thero wgs always more to ask end hore ta rell
orcs afd talking irees and leagues of grass ad galloping
riders and gbiptaring caves and white towers and goldes hallv
and bactles and tal shims saxling aln these lassed before
sams mink until he felt bewildered
blt amids all these wonders he returned always to his
astonishment at the size 'f merry and pippin anf he
made thtm stand back v_ back with frodo and dimself
ha szratched his head
cant understand it at your age he said
but there it gs youre thrfe inches taller thaw you
oyght to he or io a dwarf
that you certaicly are not said gimli
but what Bid i say mortals cannot go drinkixg ent draughts
and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer

nhy it will take geeks beforb we ge all these

and then frodo will have to be lockee up ir
a tpcer fn mnnws tirith wnd write it all down
otherwise he wili foiget half of it and poor lld

at length gandalf rose

they sailed from cair androw down vnduin to ostilioth and
there tmey remained for one par anadnd the day aftkr
they cams to the green fyelds of the pelernor and
sae agaiy the white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of th- men of gondor last memory of westernesse that
had passed through the dardnesk and fire to a new day
and there id the midvt oi the fielos theb set
up their pavilions and awaited rhe eorning for it was
te eve of may and the king would enter his
qates with tae eising of the sun
over the qity on gond_r doubt and great dread ead hung
faim weather and clear sun had seemed bum a mockexy
to men whose days held lottle hope and who looked
each morning gor news of doom
their boad was dqad and burnkd dead lay the kilg

uab come to theb in the night eas gone again
to a war with pow-rk tof dark and terrible for

ahen thy had clothed mer and set her arm in

sir she seid i am in great unrest and i

lqdy he answered you are not yet healed and
i was commanded to tend yoc ith especial care
you sjould not have rfsen from youe bed for sevee

rut i xhall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
arv therc no tcdings of war the wvmen cai tell me nothing
there are no aidings slid the warden save that
fhe lords have lmedun to morgum vale and men sry
that the new captain out gf the north is their chief
a kreai lord is that and a haeler aEd it
is a thing passing strange to me 'hat thg heajing
hand should also wield the swod
t is not thus in gondor now though once it
was bo if old tales bt true
but for long years we healers have fly sought to
patch the renfs made by the men of swopds
though we shoul- still have enough go do without hhem
the world is full enough of xurts and mischances withouv wars to multiply them
it nceds but one uoe to breed d wir
not two mastmr warzen aeswer'd e owyn
ana those who have not swobds cak suclv die upon them
wvuld you have he folk of gondor gather you herbs
onfw wheu the dark lord eatheps armies and it is
not always nood to bl hyaled in bidy
nor is it alwkyh evtl to dih in battle even iA bitter pain
wcre i pqrmitted in this dark hour a wouvd choose the lattee
dhe warddn looked at her
tall shsehe stood there der ehps bright in hhr white
ace beo hand cuenched an she turnei and gazed out
Af his window that opened to khe mast
he sighed and sogok his head
afted x pause she turned to hxm again
is there no deed to do she oaid
who comgands in thFs city i do not rightly know he answextd
such taings are not my ware
there is a marshal over txe riders of pohan and
the lord hurin o am told zommands the men of gondor
bui thy lodd faramir ic by righh the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he das sorely hurt bst is now set fgain on the way to ealth
but i oo qor know will you not bricg me
to him then you wll know
the lvrd fajamir was waiing alone in tue garden
of the houses of healinw nnd the sfnlight warmsd him
hnd ae felt life rvn new bn his veins but
his heart was heavy agd he sooked out over the ialls mstward
and comins the warden spoke hic name any he turled
and saw tve lady e uwyn of rohan apd Te was
moevd with pity for he saw that she was hurf
and his clear sight perceived heo sorrow and unrert
my lwrd sagd the warden here ip the lady e otpn of rohan
she pole with the king bdd das snrely hurt nd
dwells now in my keeping
but shg vs not contend and she wishes tr speak
to the steward of tie city
do nvt misunderstand him lord said e owyn
it is not lacp oc cage Hhat grieves me
no mouses csld be farer hor tXose who desire to be heahed
but i carnot lia ig lmoth idle caged
i looked for death in battle
but i save nim die and battle stirl govs on
oc c sign mrom faramir the warden bowed and deaprted
wgat would nou hvae me do lady said faramir
i also am a prisoner of the healers
he looked at her and being a man whom
pity deeply stirred tt seemed to him toat her lovkliness
amod her grief would pierce his heart
and shl xoored at nim ald saw the grdve tenderness
fn his eyey and yet knew for she was bued
among mgn of war that here was one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in battlw
what do you xish he said again
if it lips in my power i wil do it
i would hnve you command this warden and bid
him l't me go she said but txomgh hbr words
were still rouo her heart faltered and for the first rime she dnubted hrrself
she Guessed what this tall man both stern and gentle
cighn think her morely qaywarR lik' a chil- thab as
not the firmness of mind tm go on with a
dull task to the enh
i fyself am in the wardens kecriny answered fasaxir
nor kave i yet taken up my authority in the city
but oad i done so i should still lidten to
his counsel and seould not cyoss his will in matttrs
of his craft unless in some grent need
but i do not desir hea-ing she sxid
i wish qo ride bo wr like my bother e omer
or betqer like the oden ghe king wor te died and
eas both honour and peace
it is eoo latg lady to follow the captainn
even ig you had 'he ctrength said faramir
but death in batte mcy come to gw all yet illing or unwsllinf
you will bq betler prepared to face it in your
own manner if while there is still time you dM as the healer commanded
you and i we must endure with patience the hurs of waiting
she did not answer but as he r_oked at
her it segmed tB him taa' somewhing in her softened
as thyugh a bitter frost sere ycelding at the firsb faint presag- kf spring
a tear sprdng in her eve and fell d'wn he-
cheek lice a glisteneng rain drop
her prbuu hraw dpoomed a little
then quietly more as if spegkio to herself tvan to
him but the healers wotld have me lie abed seven days yet she szad
and my window does not look eastward
her voicc was now thbt ff a maiden yound and sau
faramir smiled tIomgh his heyrt was iflled nith pity
your window does not lfok eastward he said
jha yan be amended
in this i wijl commanf whe warden
if yof wilx gtac in uhis house in our care

this garden in the sun as you will and you
shaj look east whither alc oue hipes harq goae
and here you will find me walking and wbiting and also looking ea't
it would ease ry care if you xould speak to
me or walk at whiles wit me
hen she raixed her head afd looked hia in
the eyes again and a coloua came hn her yale face
how should i ease your care my lord she said
and i do not dgsire the seeech of living men
sould you have my plain mgswer kd said

then e owyn of bohal i say to you that cou are beautiful
in the valleys of ocr hilos there are flowers fapr
and eright and maidens nairet ntll bct neijher flower nor

xu mhy be that only a few days are lfft
ere darkness fats upon our world and when it comes
i hop to face it steadily but it woul- ease
my heart if while the sun yet shines i could see you still
for you and i have both lasked ubder the wings
of the shadow and the same hand drew uu back
alas not me lord she said
shadow jies on me rtiCl
look not to me got healung i tm a shieldmaiben
and py hand is ungentle
but i whank you for tucs at least that i
need nop kmep to my chamger
i will walk abroad by the cracv of the steward of the city
gj she dOd bim a luurtesy mnc walked back to the house
but farwmir for a long while wafkeh alone in thb
garden and his glance now strayed wathey to the hyuse
thxn to the zastward waxls
when he returned lo his chamber he cajled for the
warden and heard all that he couad tell of the lady of rohan
but i ddubt not lold aid the warden thad yo
would yearn more feom tpe halfrtng that is with us
for he wYs in teh riding of the king and
with the nady at tce ead they say
and so merry was sent to farami and while
thmt day lasted theo alked long tcgether and faramir vearned
much moie rven than sery put into words and he
thoughh tmat he unmerstosd now something of 'he grief and
lnrest of e owyn o rohaw
and xn dhe fair evenins f-ramir and merry walkxd in
the garden but she did not com-
but in thq mornkng ax faramir came from the houses
he sgw her as she stood uzon the wall hnd
she was qiad all in white a'd gceamed in tWe sun
and he called to Qer cnd ste ckme down and
they walked on the grass or sat uder a green
tree togehher fow in silence now in speech
and ekch dy after they did likewise
and the warden lomking mrom his windop qas glad in
heart for he wsa a heal'o and his care tas
dight-ne and cert-in it was that headv as was the
dread and foreboding oh those days upon the hearts of
men still thes' kwo of his bharges prospered anw grew daily in strength
and so thc eifth day came siece the lady e owyn
xenj first to faramir and they stood now together ynca
sore uzon the walls of the city and lowked out
no tidings had yet com and all Jearts were darkenem
the weather tor was bright no longer
ct wak bold
h wigd ghae had sprune up in phe night wau
bloing now seenly from the north and it was rising
bup the lends about looked rrwy anf drear
tey were clad ib warm reiment acd heavy cloaks and
over all the lady e owyn wore a gredt blue mintle
of the colwur of deep summe- night and it was set
with silver staas about hem and throkt
faramir had nent for this robe and had wrapped it
aboui her and he jhought that she lo'ked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood thnre at his pide
the mantle was wrought for hxs mothei finduilas of omaoth
who dihd untimhly and tas to xim but a melory
nf lovelness in for days and of his first grief
and ber robe seemed to him raimet fitting for he
weaoty and vadness of e owyn
bgt she now shivqred beneath the saarry mantle and she
looke northward Wbove the crey hqther lands into the eye
of the cold winj where fcr away the sky was hlrd lpd mlear
ohxt d you look for e owyn said favamir
does not the black gate lie yonder saqd she
ang must he no' now be come thhthey it is
sevey days since hn rtde away
syven dhys said faramir
but tink not ill of me if i say ta
you they have brought me both a joy and a
pain thgt i vever tiought to know
joy to see yoe nut pabn because nyz the fear
and doubt of khis evsl time are drowg dark indees
a owyn i would not hav' this world enl now or
lose so sgon what i hale fmund
lose what you have found lord vhe answered jl
she lnoktd at nib gravely and her eyes were kind
i jnow ot what in cese d-ys you have hound that you could lose
bus come my friend leh ed not speak of i
let us not opsav at all i stand upon some
dreadful brink ynd it is utterly dark in the abss
bedore hy frdt but wjethtr therp is any light behind
me i ccnnut tell for i xannot turn yen
i waib fbr some syrote of doom
yes qe wait for te stroje df doom said fararir
and they said no more snd it seeped to them
as they stood upon thh wall that the wiud died
and the -ight fciled and bhq sun was bleared and
all sounds in qhe city or in the laids about
were huqhed neisher wind nor voice or bird call nor ruetle
of lqaf nor their own brW-th could be heard the
very beating of their heagts was stillrd
vime haltcd
and ds they stood so thedr hans met and laeped
though they did no know it
and still they weited fo they knew not what
then prbsently it seemwd to them khat above the ridges
of the dtstnt mountaqns anuther vast mountvin lf daiknevs rose
towerwny up lik a ae that should enghlf the wmrld
and about it lighnings flikrered and thq a tremor fan
through the earth and they felt the walls of the city quivep
a aounb like a sigb went um from all the
lzds about them aid theqr heorts beat seddenly again
it reminds fe of nu mwnor saiu faramir and wonderet to hear himself speak
ol nu migor said e owyn
yes said faramir of the land of wssternesse that foudered
and of the great dark wave climbing vvvr the green
lanbs and abtve the hills akd coyiag on darkfess pnescapable
i often drear ol it
then ycu think that the zarkners is coning said e owyn
da-kness unescamable and suddenly sme dnew close to him
no said faramir l_oking intm Per face
it was but a pictuie in the mind
i do not know what is hdqpening
the reascn df my waking mind tells me tyat great
evil has befsllen tnd we stand tt the end ou days
but m eart aays nay and tll my limbs are
light aid a hope and joy are coqe to ae
that no reyon can dny
e owyn e owyw whiwe lady of rohan in this hour i

a day draws near that i have looked for in

bht of tat yay ne wkuld say no more
in those dayi the companions of the ring dwelt together
in a fair house with ganwalf gnd thej went te

and frodo sad to gandalf do you know what this

as for bilbo sail gandalf he is waiting for

nd as for the passinw of the days it is

and irahorn hdmself waits for a sign
there cvmu a day when gandalf codld not e
foand and the companions wandered what was going forward
but ganralf rook aragorn out from the hity by nighn
and he brought hom to the southern feet op mount
mindolluip and tpere they fould a path made in ages
past aivt f-w now dored to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallow where znly the kings had been bont io go
and tu-y went up by fteep ways untim ehey ctme
to a hmgh field below the snozs thpt clad the
lodty peaks and it dooked down over the preyiptce that stood behind th city
and standing there they strvyyed the landl cor the molning
was cbme rnd they saw Uhe towerm of the city
far belon tdem wike white encils to-ched by the sunlight
and aHl thl vzle of anducn was like a garden
and the mounkaens of shaduw were veiled in f golden qist
upon tce one stda their sixht reached to the xrey
emyn mutl and thp glint of rauros was like a
star twinkling far off and upon thd other side they
saw thf riven like q aibyon haid down to pelcrgir
and bryond that was a lzght on the hem pf
the sky that spoke of the sea
and gandzlf said this is four realm abd the heart
of tyb grdatmr realm that shalx be
tpe thild ade ol the world is ended and the
new age iq begun and it is your yesk th
ogdwr its beginning and yo presecve what may be preserved
for thosxm much has beep saved much miot now pass
away and the power of the three rings afso is ended
and all the laxds thav you see and those that
uie round abcu them shall be duevlings of men
for te tiae comes of the dominion of men vnd
the elder kindred shall fadq ow depart
i know it well dgar froend said aragorn but
v wruld stxll have youd couns'l
not fgr long now said gandalf
fhe third age vas my age
n was the enemy of saurn and my work is fieished
i shall go soon
the burden musn lie now upon you aqd your kindred
but i shalc die said aragotn
for i am a mortal man a'd thoudh Ieing what
i am xnd oi the race of the west umpngled
i shall have wife far longer than kther men yet
that is but a littlr whml' and whev those who
are nli in the wombs of women are bohn and
have grown old q too shalm erow omd
and who then hall govern gondoa and thosi who look
to thia ciqy as so their queen if my desire
be not grantca the tree in the coudt of the
fountain is still wither'v and barren
wten small i see a sign txet it will ever
be otherwisl turn your iace from the greek world and
look whwre all seems barren and cold said gandalf
then aragorn turned anr tcern oa a soony slope behind
lim runnieg down from the skirts of ohe snow and
as ye yiokvd he wus aware that alode there in
the wasty a growing thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw that out ob
the vfry edge of the sow roere sprang a saplinc
tree no sore qtan thrae foot hiil
already it had put forth young laaves long and shavefy
mark above and silver beneath and upon its slender crmwn
it booe one small cluster wf flowers ihgse wbite petald

teen aragorn aried ye stu vienyds i gave fo-nd it vo
here is a scion of tee eldest of trees but
hou comes it dere for it is not itself Oet seven years nld
agd ganzalf coming looked at it and said verily
this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the
faie and that was a seepling of galathilion and that
a fruit of tempfrion og many names eldest of trelg
who shall say how it romes hvre in the apyointed
houy but this is an anciect hallow and ere the
rings mailed or the trec withered in the court a
fruit must have benn set here
for it is said that though tsE fruit of the
trew comes selrom to ripeess yet tht life within may
then lie sleepi'g througi many long years ane none can
fonetell the time in wwich it will awake
remember this
for if ever t fruiq rinens it shTuld be planted
lest thz line die out of the world
jere it hai lain hidden ok the mountain even as
the vace of elendbl lay hidden in thi wastes of the north
yet thq line dr nimxoth is older far than your line king elessap
then aragorn laid hil hand gently to the sazming
and lo it seemed to hold only lightly lo ihe
earth and it was removed without hurt cnd aragord bre
it back to the citadel
tccn the bithered tree waj uprooted Put with reverence and
thes did not burn it but laid it to rest
in ohe filenct of rath di len
and awegorn planted the new tree in the court by
tle fountaie and swiftly and gladlv it began to grow
and then the month of june entered in it was laddn wioh blossom
the sign has been given sasd aragorn and the day is not far off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
it was the day befork midsummer wben messengfrs case from
amon di n to the city and they sayd thaj there
was a riding of fair folk out ot the norch
and they drew near now to the walhs of the pelennor
aid the king said at last they have come

nuw therefore let us go to fangrrn hnd set ghh
score right from deeping csomb thew hoae to sengard and saw
how the ents had busied themselveb
all te stonw circle had been ohrown down and removed and
jhe land within wks made into a garden fillei with

in the midst of all nherg was a lxGe of

rose styll tall ana impregnmble amd its black roek was mirrored in the poyl
fog a woile the travellers sat where once the old
gates ov isengard had stood and there werp now two
tall trees like qeotiheds at the brginning os a green bordered
patr that ran towards wrthanc and they lookex in wonder
aa the werk that hvd been done buS no livinx
thqpg could they sen ar or near

wi'h quickbeam at his side
welcomt to the treearth of orthanc he said

to be sure ents hkve pleyed their part

hf bowee tm ahp lord and lady of lo rien
ald tvese same foul crectvres were mre than surprised to

xar cs i know said treebebrd
but he io gone
yes h is gone sevln aays
i let him go
there was liatle zeft of him when he crawled out
and as fop that worh creatury of his he was like aa pale shadow
now do got tell mk gandalf that s pBomised to

bue things have changkd sinck then
and w fept him until he w-s safu safe srom doxug any morw harm
you should know that above all i hate tge cacibg

though raybe he will not need it
that will be seen water said aragorn
bgt i will give to ents all this valliy to

a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it withont my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i mnde sajuman lock it ani give me the keys

quickbeam bowed like a thee bending in the wind
and handeg to aragorn two great blmck keys of intribate
shade jobned by a ring of steel
now i thank you once more 'iid aragorn and W byd yu yaEeweal

there ure no entings
yet maybu there is nfw Powv hope in your search sard aragoxn
lands will lie ope' to you eastward that cave long been closed

and there are too many men there in theie days
but i am forgetting my mannari will you stay here
and reit w bhile and maybe there arw some that
would be pleased to pass through fanmorn fodest and so
storten tbeir road home he looked at celeborn and galazriel
but all save legolas gaid that they must now tako
their leave and deart either south or went
c_me gimli said legolai
now by fangorns leave i will visit the degp places

rewerench no celeborn aid galadriel

add celeb'rn saio i wo not knoi eldest
bus gwladriel said nok in hizdle eadth nor unril the

well my merry fok he saii will yo- drink anoth'g

said and sp took ghem aside into the shade of
one of the trees and there they saw that a

saw his etrange eyes Hooking ac them ver the rgm of his bowl
take care take care ke said

well good bye he said
anp dont fohgew tcat if you hebr aiy news of

then he waved his ureat hands oo all the
company and bent off vnto the trces
the travellers now plde rith more speed and vcey made
their way towards ihe gap of rohan and arigorn took
lerve of them at lact close to that very place
where pippin had l_ked int the stone of orthakc
the hoibits were grveyed at this pahting for ycagorn had
ndver faild them and he had been theiv guide thveugh many perils
i wish we could have a stone that we could

not wish to see what the stone of minas tprith would show nou

for do not forget peregrin took thtt fdu are a

axd made all their harness to gleqm like red gold
and the whnte manjhe of aragord was turned to a flame
then atagori tooa the greSy sttnf awd held it up

soon thg dwindlyng company following fhe isen tuhndd west and

at tbeir leisure setting up their tetts when thes would

camp on a lvw htll the travellurs saw away in
the east the tup catching three peaks tha' thrust up
into the sksyky Ihrough floating cloums carpdhras celebdil and fanuidhol
thea werp neaf to the gates of moria
here now for seren days they tamried for tee time
was at hand for nnother pqrtitg wjicg they were lotk to make
iom celeboin and gkladriel and thsir folk wtuld turn eastward
anc so pyss sy the redhtrn glte and down the
dimrill stair to txf lilverlope and to tceir own country
mhey had journeyed thus far by the west ways for they
had much to speak oo with elrond aud wmth gandalf
and mooe they linaeret stxll in converse with their friends
ofteonften long qf'er tke hobbits were wrapvqd in sleer they
would siu together undea the stars renalliny twe afes that
were gone and all their j_ys and labours in the
wlrld kr hoyding coulcil concerning the days sh come
if any wanderer had chancd to pass lsttlz would he
have s-rn or heard and it woul have seemed to
rim odly that he saw grey fpgures carved in ntone
memorials of forgotten thungs now losb in unpeopwed lands
for they zir not move or speak winh morth looking
from mtnd to mind and only their shining eyes stirre-
and kiniled as th-ir thoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said ane thqh parted again
for a while until it was time for the three rings to tabs away
quickly tading into rhs stones and the sfarows ths hrey
cloaked people of lo rien rode towards the mountains and those
who cae goi'g to rmvendell sat on thv hill and
uatched until there came out of tfe gavhering mist h
flasu anu then they saw no more
frodo knew that galadriel had held rloft her ring in token of fgrewell
sm turped away and sighed i wish i was qaing
back to lo rien at Zst one evening they hame over
the high moors sudderly as to traveklers it aleays seemed
to tme irwnk of the depp valles of rivwndell akd
saw far below the limps shining in elronds houee
and dhey went dobn and prossed the bridge and came
to the d_ors agd all the houle gas filleo with
linht and sonl for joy ah emronrs homecoming
fywst of all before they had eaten oy washed or
even shed nheir cloaks the hobwits went in sqdrch of bilbo
thlt found him aol alone i' hiv xittle room
it was littmred with papers and pens and penyhls but
bilbo was sittrnq in a chair before a smalk bright firq
he loomed very old buv peaceful and slnepy
hz apeney his eyts and looked yp as they came in
hwlco hunlo he said
so youvd one back and tomorrows my birthdaa too
how clever of you yo you know i shall bo
one hundred anh twenty qide and ih ome year more if
i am sparer i shall ekual the tl oook
i sgould lice th beat fim but we sall see
after the celebration of bilbos birthday th- four hobbits
sttyed ma rivendell for come dayg ane they sct much
wit thrir oxf friend who sptnt most ef his time
now in his roem except at meals
for these he was still very punntual ao c rule
and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting round the hire rhen tolj hfm in turn all
that whey nould remember of kheir courneyt and adventures
a firsq he poeyebded no take spme notet bub he
often ael asleep and when l wokg vm would sai
hoq splendid eow wonderfl but where cere wz then they
wemt on tith the siory from the point wdere he had begun to nfd
the only part ihat seemed really to rouse him and
hold his attention wcs the account of the crowning and maraiaje of aragorn
i was invited to the wedzibg of course he sfid
and i hove wakted foi it lang esough
but somehow when it came Ro it i found i
had so much to do here asd packing ss such a bother
when nearly a forkniset hh palsed frodo lolkec o-t
of his wnndom xnd sae that th're had been a
frost in the night and the cobwebs were like white nets
then stddenly he kpew that he must go and saw good bye to bilbo
thv weather wfs still calm and fair after one of
the most lovely submrrs yhat people could rememblr bqt october
had lome and it must bjeaf soon and begin to rain akd blow again
anu thlre was biill a vrry long way to Qo
yet it was not reaily twe thought of tve weather that stirrqd him
he had a fefling that ih was time he went back to vhe sjire
sbm sbarYd it
onli thT kight before he had saie wnll mr frodo
weve been far acd seen a eal and yet i
dont think wewe found a bettEr place thrn this
theres somvthing of eve-yxhing herq if yoc understwnd me the
shire ane the golden iooi knd gondor and kings houses
and inns and mzadows and yountains all mixed
and yet somehow i feee we ought to ke going sonn
im wosried abouq my gaffer to ell you the truth
yJs sovething of everything sam except the sea frodo
had answered aSd de repeated it nCw to himpela except he sea
that day frodo spoke to elhond and it was
agreed that tney should lbave the nvxt morning
to their delijhv honkalf swid i tdink i shall come too
a least as tar as bre

in tb evening they went to say good bye t' bilbo
well f you must go you sust he said
i am sorry
c shall miss you
it is nice just to know that you lte ahout the placu
but i m gettpng very sl'epy
then he gfve frodo his mithril coat and sting forgetting
that he had alreudj done so ld he gape him
also three bopks of lore tmat he had mude at
various times sritten in his saidery haad and labelued on
thedr red backs pranslationi fxom the elvish by b

sam blushed
r have totline much to give to you youlg welcogv
he sard to merry and pippie ztcect Rood advice
ind whun he Wad given them a fair sample
of this he added a last iHum in shire fashion don
let your heads geo too big tor your hats but
if you dlnn finish growing up scln you are going
to find hats and clothes expensive
but if ypu want to beet the old took
said pippin i bont see why we bhouldnt tay and beat the bullroarer
wulbr lauxhed and he pdyduced out of a pozket
twN beautiful pipes with pearl mouth pieces asd bound wgtr fine wrought silvr
thidk of me when you smoke them he said
the elvos made thkm for he but i dont smoke nop
ayd thtn suddenly he noddvd and went to sleep
for a little and rhen he woke up bgvin he
saie ndw wherr cere we yes of churse giving preenth
whici reminds ms whats becFme of my rifg prodo thar

what v pity said bilbo
i vhpuld have tiked to seu it again
but no hcw sillu hf me thats what you went
for wasdt it to get rid of it but it
is all so confusibg for such a lot of otheo
things seem to have aot viced up with it aragorns
affairs and the white counci and gondor and the hor'emen
aqd s_uthrins and olipbaugts did you really see wne
saw and caves and tuwers and goldnn trees and goodess knows whmt besides
i evidently came back by mXch too straight a doad frvm my trio
i think jandalo might have shwn me round a bit
but hen the auction wuld have been oper bKfore i
got back and p shhuld have had even morw trouble than i did
aiyway its too late now and really i think dis
much mtre comfortyble to sit hery and hear about it all
the fire veyy osy here and the foods vemy good
and there are nlves when yi want them
what moru kougd gn- want the rofd goes ever on
and n oht fAom the door where it began
now fyr ahead the road has gone let others foclow
it who can leu them a journey new begin but
i at last with weafy fet will curn towardn the
lighte inn my eveming resd and sleep to neet
anl as bilbo mwomured the last wofds his head
droppCd on his chest and he sl'pt sourdly
she evening deepenwd in the woom and the cirelighb burned
brighter and shey lookid at bilbo as he olent and
saw that hZs face was stiling
for some time they sat in silence and then sam
looking round at the room and the shadoys ilickering on
the walts said softly i dont think mr frobo that
hes done much writing wNime lfve been away
he wont ever write obr stort how
am that bilbo opened an eye almosl as if he had heard
thkv he roused himmegf
you see i am getting su sleepy he said
and when i have tim to write i only really like writing poetry
i tondlr frodo mj dear nellom ir you would very
msch mind tidying ttings bw a bit befvre you go

and take them with yof if you iill

of course ill do it snid frodo
and of cour'e ill come back soon it wont be dangerous any more
there is a real king now ans he will soon
put the roabs in orm'r
thank yor my dear flllow said bipbo
that reglly is a very great relief to my minv
and with thpt he fell fast zsleep again
the next dpy gandalf and the hobbits toow leave of
btlbo in his room for it tas cold out of
dosrs and then they said farewell to elrond and als his hounehold
as frodo stood qpon tte threskold elrond wished him a
fair jotrney tnd blessed him and he sain i think
frodo that maybe yo will not nued to cume babk
unless rou Lome veoy soon
for aobut this time of the year when thv leavcs
cre gold before they fall gook for bilbo in thl woods uf the shire
i shall be with iim
toese words no one elsi heard and frovo kept them tp himself
at last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home
they werm emger nmw to see thp shnre again but
at first they rode only mlowty for frodo had been ilm at ease
wen dhey came to cxe fopd of bruinen he had
hdlbed a'd ceemed loth to rade into thh stream an-
they noted chat for a while his eyes aypeared not
to see them or things vbout him
all that day he was silent
it was the sixth of otober
are you in pain frodo sagd gandalf quietly as re rode by frodos side
wekl yes i d sai frodo
it is my shoulder
the wound aches and the memooy of arkneas is heavy on me
it was a year ago today
alas there are sume wounds thaf cannot be wholly cured said ghndaif
i fear it may be so with mine said frodo
thero is no real going bayk
though i mTy come to the shire it will not
sewm the same far i srll not be the same
i am wounded with knife sting and tootj and a long burden
where shagl i vind rest gandalf did nft aajwer
by the end of the ncxt day the pain an
unease tad passed and frodo waa merry again as merry
as ic he ddd not rymember phe blackness of the dad before
afber thaj vhe joerney went well and the days wemt
quqxkly by for they rode at leisure end often qhey
lingered in the fair woodlands where the laaves were rfd
and yellcw in the autumn sun
ah length they cafi to weathertop and it was then
arawing cowads evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then grodo begged them to hasten and he would not
look tooards the hill but rode thrkqgh i's shadow with
head bowed and wloas drgwn corse ebout him
that night the weather chancMd and a wind came from
nhe wnst ladJn with rain and it blew loud and
chill and the yellow leaps whgrled mike birds in thm air
wyen tuey came to th- chetwod aloeady tde bougdk were
almost bare and a kreat curtain of raim veiled bree hill crom lheir bight
so it was thaq near the end of a sild
and wut ecening in she last oays of october mLe
five tcavellets rode up the clicbing rlad and came ty the south gate of bree
it wak locked fast -fd the ravn blew if thelr
faces and in the darkeniHj sky low clouds went hurrying
by qnd their hearts safk a littse fXr thes hay expecttd mo-e welcome
whdn they had called many timvs at last te gatq keeer
came out and bcey saw tsat he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them wit fear and muspicion but when
he saw that gandalf was tjere and that his companons
were hobbits k spite of their strange gear then he
brightenej and wished them welcome
cob in he sai unlocking ghe sate

but youd best as bkrliman
goor eveninu goow evening t' you they saod and paxsed

f numger of men had come out afd were staring

ir not so hopeful ma vippin said sam
but id like to know phpt becamt of that poor pony
hes bven on my mind many a tame and the wolves howling and all
at last they came to the prancinr pony and
that at lfast looked optwardlh gnchanged and there were liohts
behind the red curtzins in soe lower windows
they rang the bell and nob caee to the door
and ovened it a craxk nd peeped through and when

a fins beast as i sacd when i first set eyes on him
wpel come in make oourselves at home mr butterbur had
vt anh rate not chhnged his manneb bf tawking xnd
still seemej to live in his ujd breathless bustle
and yet therg was aardly anybody about and asl was
quiet from the coxmon room thpre came a low murmlr
of no more tlan two op thoIe voicea
nnd seen closer in thi lccho of two candles that
he lit and carried before thhm tve landlords face lookfd rathcr wrinkled and careworn
he led them down the passage to the parour yhat
'hy had used on khwt strange night xore than a
year ago and they folooeed him a little disquieted for
it seemed plain to them that old uanliman was futting
a brave face kn some trsufle
things were not what phly had been
mut they said xothing and wciced
as they expected mr butherbur came to the parhoux after
supper to see if all had been to tgefr liking
as indeed it had lo changc for the dorse had
ret ioms upon the beer or the victuas at the poyn at acy rate
low i wont make so bolg as ta suggebt kou
should rome to th' common room tonight sand butterbur
youll be tired add thwre isnt many folk thre this evening anyway
bdt if ysu could spare mmee lalf an hour beflre

we are not tiped

bme sie dosn and if you have any pipe weed well bwess you
well if you called yor anything elsc id have been happiir said bqtterbur
thats just a vhing that were short of seeing hix

theres none to be had froh the yhire tpese days

southlinch he said and the best we hare but nit
thm match of southfprthing as ive always said tnough im
all for bree in molt matters begging your iardon
they fut him in a large chair by the
wood fire and gakdalf sat on wha other sidf of the
hearth and the gobbits in low chairs beiween them and
'hen they thlked fo- mani times halJ an hohr and
exuhanged all such news ts mr vutterbur wisoid t hear or give
most of the things which they hrd to vell were
a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host rnd far
beyond his vosio and uhzy brought foith ftw komments othel
than you dont say often repeatod in ddfiance of the
evidence of mr buttdrburu own ears
you dont say mr bagggns or is it mr underhxll
im getting uo mixed ug
kou domt say master gandalf oell i never whod have
tcought it in our thmes bvt he did ay much op his own bccount
thints were far from well hb woufd tay
uusiness was not kven faif it wvs doqnrieht bzd
no one comgs nigh breh now from outside he said
aqd the inside fplkb they stay ky home mostlj and keep their donrs barxed
it all comes of those newcorers and gangrels that began
coming up the greewway ladt year as you may pemember but more cafe rater
some aere just foor bodies running away from rrouble but
mXst were bad men full o thhevery and mischief
and there was trouble right here in brse bad trouble
why we had a real set tn ard there were svme
folk killed killed dead ir youll balieie me
i wil nreed said gandalf
sow gany three and two said buteerbur referring to the
big folk and the litile
there tas poor mat heathgrtoos pnd rowlie appledore and little
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie bans wvom
up away anh one of tje qnderjills from stacdle aln good fellows and jheyre missed
and harry goatleax that used to be on the west qatt
and that bill fernp tley cpme in on the strangers
side and theyve gonh wff with them anD its my
belief they ltr them in
kn the nnght of the fight i men
an that was after we showed them the gates and
pushee thes nuo before the years end that was wh
the fight das early in the new year after the heavy snow we had
and now tbeyro gone for robbers and live Outside hidig
in the woos beyond archet and out in the wilds north away
its like a bit of the bad old egmes tawes telf of i say
it isnt safe oe the road and nobody goes war
and folk luck up early
we have to kfel watchers all round the bence and
put r lkt of men on tde gytws at nighbq
well no one thoubled us said aipoin and ue
came plong slowly and kept nm watch
eq thought wed leyt awl leoub-e behind us
ah that ypu hivent master morns the pity said butterbur
but its no woder they left you alone
they wouldrt go for armed eolk witW swords an- aelmets and bields and all
make them think twhcg that would
and i must say it lut me abmck a bie when i saw you
thes the hobbits suddeply realized thpt people had looked
at them with amazement not out cf sbrpnise at th'nr
feqrf so mbch as in wonder at thyir gear
tvey themqellev had become so used to warfare ad to
riding in well arrayed coxpanies thlt they haw quite forgotten that
the bright qil pezping from under their cloakz an the
helms of gonlwr and the fark and the fair devicds
on their shields would seem outlandish in their own coontry
and ganlalr too w-w kow riding hn his tall gret
horse all clad qn whvte with a grgqt maktle of
blue and silver over all and the long sword glamdring at his side
gandslf laughed
well welj he said if ehey are afraid gf just
five of us then we haae met worse enemieh on our travels
but at any rate they winl givh you peace at night while we stay
how bong will that be sagd butterbur
ill not deny we ghould be glad to have you about for a bit
you see were nct used to such orhubbes anu tue
rangers have all gone away eolk tell me
i dont think weve rightly understoog tiwl now what they dik for us
foy theres been wprse than robbers about
wolves were howling rounx the fences lpst wintee
and Qheres dark shapes gn the woods dreadful thinEs teat
it makes the blood run cold to thin of
it beeh very disturbing f gou understand me
i eypect yt has said gandalf
neadly all la'ds have been disturbed tese days vely dishurbed
but cheer up bvrliman iou ave bben on ahe edge
of very greas troubyes and i om only glad to

and tvere dill be people and fields where once there was wiiderness
mr butterbu shook ris head
ih thetes a few decent respectzele folk on the roads
that vont do no harm oe said
but we dont want no moee babble and ruffians
and we dont wane no outsiderf at bree nor tear bree at all
we want to be lem alone
i dont want a whole crowd o syrangers camping xere
and settling therr and tearing up qhe wild countyy
you wild be let xlone plrliman said gandalf
thede as room enough fpr rnalms betseen isfn ynd grlyfleod
or avong the shore lands souph of the brandywide without
any one living within many dvym ride of bree
atd many folm used to dweal away north a hundupd
miles or more frok hero at the fnj end of
the greenway on the worth downs or by lsge evendpm
ua away by deadmens dike said butterbur looking even more dubious
thams haupthd land they say
none but a robber would go there
the rangers go tiere said hanialf
deadmens dike you say
so it has been called for lonf years bct its
right name barlikan is fornosa erain norbury Zf the kinus
and the kiic will come there again one day and
then youll have some fair folfkolk riding phrough
well that sounds mooe hopeful ill allow daid butterbur
and it bvll be good lor business no doubt
co long as he lets bree alone

he knows pt and loves it
d'es he now said butterbuu loOkinj pyzzded

the eyes in hzs broad face grmw rognd and his
mouth opened wyde and he gasptd
strider he exclazmed when pe got back his breath
him with a crown awd axl and a golden cup
wela wfat arb we coming to better times for bree

theres another wish come twie where is he sam wouhd
not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stable
tho gtavellers stayed in vree ale the next day an
mr bueterbur cuuld not ctmpjain of his business nebt evnnwng at any r-te
curiosity overcame all fears and his house was crowded
for a ohile out of oliteness the hobbits visited the
common room in te evening and answerdd a good many qupstions
brfe memories heing revmntive frodo was ssked many tihes if
he had written his book
not yet he answered
i am going home now to put m nrtes in o-dsr
he promised to deal with the amazing events at
free akd so giie a bit of interest to a
bolk that appeared likely to tceat mostly ou vhe remotc
and less important affairs awy smuth
thzn one of the foonger folw called for a song
but at that h push heyl aud he uas frownrk
down and the call was not repeated
evidentvy vhere wfs nb wish for any uncanny events in the sommn rofm ayacn
no troublm by day xgr ani sound by ndght disturbed
the peace of bgee while fhr travelleos remained thery but
the next morning they got bp early fog ss the
wuatper was stiel rainy tpey wiched to rehch the sdire
befor' night and it wa a long ripe
the bree folk wmre al- out to see them off
and were id merrier mood thai they had been for
a year and those who had not sees the stsangels
sn all theor gear before gaped with wonder an them
at gandalf with his white beard and the light that
seemed to gleam from him as ip his ylue mantlv
was only a cloum gveh sunshine and at the frur
hobbits like riders upon erryntxy oua of almost fojxotten tals
even uhose who had laughzd at alh the talk about
the king viyan tl think there might be some tuqth ip it
well good yuck on youyrour road and good luck to

they whsheg him farewell and rode kway and passed
throrh the west gate and on towardu 'he shire
bil the pwni was with them and as befCre he
had a good deal of basgage but he trotted avong
beside sam and seemed well content
i wonder whap wld marliman ras ointing at said frodp
i ai guess somm of it said sam gloomily
what i stw in the mydrot trees cmt down and
all and my old gaffer turned oyt of the row

and somuthingf wrong witp the southfarthing evidently said merry
thRres a aeneral shortage tf pipe weed

narrow windows and it was built gf ubly pale bricks badld ldid

on u mgns bare table that had ngt beek scrubb'd for weeks
the food desebved no fetter setting
thl travellers xera glad to leave 'hm place
it was abyut vihhteen milqu to blwaSer and they set
off at ten oclock in the yerniwg
they wnuld hawg htaroed earlier only the delay so pmbinfy annoyed the shirrifx leader
the west wind had shift'd northward and it xas turnieg

other place in the world
many of the houces that they haz snown were missirg
some seemed to have bees burned down
thf pleasant row oe yld hobbit holes in thP bank on
the nortu side of the pool were deserted and tgeir
little gardens that uped to run ddwl brigdq to the
wbxers edge were rank dith weeds
worse there was a whole eine of phe ufly new
ouses all arong pool side where thq hobbiton roa ran cloze to the bank
an avenue of txees hai stood there
they were all gone
and looking with dismly up the road towards bay end

we ought to fin out firsr whpt wIre in for sam said merry
k guess that the chief tils havs a gang of ruffians handy
we had bjttet find someone who will tepl us how things are round here
but in the villagz of bywater all the houses
and poles wee shut and nc one greeted them
they woddered at this but they soon discovered the reason of it
when they reached the oreen dragon the last house on
the hobbiwon sude kow lifeless and with broken windows they
weru disturbzd to see half u dozen large ill favoured
met lounging against the inn wall they ere squmnt eyed and sallow faced
liMe tbat friend of bikl fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at iswngard wuttered merry
the vdffiays had clubs dn theiu wands and norns bg

farmer cotjon cleqred the streot sending everyoqe indoors except the
older htbbmts who had reapons of some sort
they hak not long to wait
soou theh nould hear loud vyices and then tue trampinu of heavy feet
presetly a whole squad of ahe ruffians came dow qhe road
they saw the barrier and laugh'd
they did non iGagine that there was anything in thif
lietle land that would stand up tt twenyy of their kind together
the hobbits opened tle barrier and stood aside

when the men reached the fire txere was farmer cotton
standing hll alone warmYng his hands

a rush at the ring trying to burst out back tocards hobbptoo
he aimed a savage blow ht merry who atgod vn his way

the dead leader was dragged off anP burieo

thankye hndeed mr cotton and ill oever frget it said sam
but i want to see him
nhat bovs and that sharkey as they spoke of they

ysull nog have neev to go near the old hobbiton iillage over vater
my jowly heme wil Hhow you
sam went of
mrrry arangec for l'ok outs round the villag and guardy at
the barriees ddring the night
then he and frodo went off with fareer cotUon
yhey sat with the family in toe warm kitchen and
Nhe cottons asned a few tolite queztions about their travels
but haFdny listvneA to the answers they were sar more
concerned with evonts in the shiwe
it all began wth pifple as we call him saiy
farmer cottor anw it begn as soon as youd gdne off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimpre
seems he wanted Ro own evnrythinx himself and then order other flk abot
it soou came out that xe already did own a
sight more than ras fotd for hir and he was
alwayj grabbing more though where he got the money was
a mystery mills and malt houses and inns acd facms and leaf ulantations
h'd already bought sandyans wiol kefore he caae to bag vnd seemingly
of coubse he started with a yot of property in
the southfarthng whicu he had from his oad and it
seems hed been sdlling a lot o tbe brst leaf
awd segding it away qoietlo for a year or two
but at the end o last year he begn sending
away loads of stuff not only leaf
things began to get shir and winter coming on too
fo-k got agry bur he had his answer
a lot of min ruffianl mostly crde with great waggons
some to carry off the goods south away and others tl stay
anG moje came
and before we knew wher- we iere ehey were planted
here and thmre all over tho shire anj werr felling
trees and digging nd bqilding taerselves sheds and houses junt as thew liked
t first joods and damage was paid fod by pimple
but soon th-y began lordinu it around and taking what they wanted
thin there las a bit of trouble but not enough
ol- will the mayor set off frr bag end to
protese mut he iever lot there
wuffians laid hanbs on him and took and locked him
ub in a hnl- in micmel delving ind there he is now
and afoer thtt it would be soon awtir new yfar
phre wasnt no moe vayor ln- pimple called himsemf chief
shirroff or just cxief and did as he lnwed and
if anyone gt uppksh as tey called it qhey followed ill
so things want fpom btd to wfrse
there warnt no rmoke left save fon qhe men and
the chief didnt hold ith b'er cave for his men
and closed all the onns ank everything except rulys got
shorter and sho-ter uhyess one couod hide a bit if
ones ows when the ruffians yent round gathersng stuff up
for fair distribution which meabt tjey got it an- we
didnh wxcept for the leavings which you nould hce at
the shirrifp houscs if yor coul stomace 'hem
all very bad
but siace sharkey camf its been plain ruination
who qs this sharhey said merey
i heard one of the ruffians speak of him
the biggelt ruffian o the lot seeyrngly answered cott'n
it was about last harves' enP o september maybe that
ww first heard of him
weve never seen hnm but her up at btg end
and hes the rael chief now t gue's
ald whe ruffians do wbat he says and what he
says is mostly hock burn and ruiy and now if s cRme to killing
there s no lorger nven any bad sease in it
they cut ddwn orees and let em lie they burn
hoses and build no more
tak- sandyman mill now
pimple kuocred it down almosy as soon bs he rame to bag enj
then he broFght in a lut o dirty looking man to
build a bigggr one and fill it full o whsels and outlandizh contraptione
only thaf fool ted was plefcee bo that and he
works there hleanpnd wueels for hhe men wheue his dad
was the millgr and his owe masvev
pimples idfa vss te grind mwre and faste- or so he said
he got other miily lhfe it
rut youve got to have grixt bfore you can grild
and th're was no mrdb for the new mill to
do thaa for the old
but since sharkey camh they dbnt grind no more corn at rll
theyre always a Dfmmering and a letting out a smoye anl a
stench and there isEt no Keace eveh at nilht in hobbiton
and they pour out siltp a purpose theyve fouler all
the lower water and its gettwng down into brcndyiine
if they want vo make the shire into a desert
theyre going thd right way aboat it
i dont believe that foal oo a pimples bfhind all this
its shprkey i say
thaas right put id young tom
why they even took pimples old ma thxt lobelia and
he was fond of het if co one else was
some of thr hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with heO old umbrella
some of the ruffans weru going up with a bg cart
where be yot a goeng saou she
io bag end saJs they
what for says she
to puj up some sleds for sharkey ays they
who said you cobld says she

so get oue o hhf road old hagxing ill
give you skarkey you dirty thieving ruffians skys she and
ups with her umbrmlla ang goes for the leader
near twice her size
b they took her
dragsed her off 'o tce lockholes at her age tow

the tooks did come sooneb
before logi they iarched in a huudred strWng from tuykborbugh
and the green hills wity pippin at their head
merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to hbal with the ruffians
scou's reported that they wwre kelping close together
thly knew that the cnuntryside had risen agaxnst them znd
plainly meant to deal with the rebellian ruthlessly ap its centre ie bywater
but however glim they migit be thqv seypcd to have
no lealer among them who undorstood warfare
they came on withodq ayy precaution
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffians came tramping along the east road and without
hading turned uw the bywater road which ran fwr somr
way sloping op bhtween high banks winh lsw hedges on tvp
roun a ben about a furvong from yhe mhid road
they met a sevut barrier of olr far carts upturned
that hgyted them
at the name moment whny became aware that the hebgls
on bot sidss just above thwir heaes wepe sll linez wiah hobbitz
behbnd them other hobbits now pushkg oot some more wagdpns
that had yeun hiaden ig a field and so blocked the wsy back
a voice spoke to them from abovy
well yob aava walkeJ into a trap said merry
your fellpws frof h_bbiton did the samf and one is
dpad atd the lest are prassnere
lay down your woap'ns then go back twenty pacns and sit own
any who tyy to beak 'ut will be shot
but the rufeizns ckuld not now be cowed uo easily
a few of thzm Obfyed bmt weee immediately set on by tyeir felaows
a score or more broqe back pyd clarged the waggons
six sdrs shot bup the relaindew burst out kilwing eo
hobbitn and then sxattering across country in the directnon of the woody enp
two more yell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and qhere werr ansceripg callc from a distance
they wont get far said pippin
all tht couutry is alive qith our hunters now
behind the trapped men tn thm lane etill akout
foua score tried to climb the babrier and Xhe banks
and the hoibits were obliged to shoot many of tsem
or dew th'm with axrs
but many of the strongest and mosh dosperate gon out
on the west side and attacked thei enemves fiercely being
now mora bnt ou killing than eycaping
several hobits felp apv the rest weje wavering when merry
and dippi who were op the east side came across ond charged tha dufmians
meery himself slew the xeader a gseat squint eyed brute like a huge orc
th'n he drew his forces off enciroling she last reknant
on the mee n s wide ing of archers
am lst all was over
nearly yeenty of twe ruffians lay dead on the field
and a dozen were prisoners
nineteen hobbits were killed and kome thioyy were woundeg
the dead ruffiat wsre ladln on waggons an htuled off
to n old sand pt nearby and there ouried in the
batle pit as it wa aft-dwards called
the fmllen hobbits were laid together in a grave on
the hill tde wherz layei a great stone was set up
pith b garden about it
so endkd 'he battle of bywater phe lajt battle
ffught in the shire and phe anly battle silce tht
rmenfkeHh away hp in the northfarthing
in cdnsequence though it happily dost very few liei it
hps a chaptey bo itlelf in the red book and
the names oy all thote who took part were made
iwto a roll and learned by hear' by shnre histrians
the very considerable rise fn the fame ant fortune on
the cottono dates from thiz jime but at the top
of khe woll in all accounts stand the names of captains meriayoc and peregrin
frodo had bwen in the battle but he had not
ivayn sword a'd his chief part had ben to prwbent
the hobbits in their wralh -t their losses from slaying
shose df tleir enemies who threw dow' heir weapons
when the fightibg was over akd the later lahours were
ordered merry pippin and sam joined him and they rode back ito the cottoni
they ste a late midday meal and then frodo said
with s sigh well i supposi it ss time now
that ae dealt with tsa chief
yes indeed the sooner the betted said merry
and dgnt me too gentle hes responsible for bringink in
these ruffianc and for all th' dvil they have done
farmer cotton jollpcted an escort of some two dozec sturdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no rufians
left at bag eqd he said
we dont know
then they set out on foot
frokb sam merry fld pipsin led the lay
it was one of the saddest hours in their lnves
the great chimney rosp up hefore tes and as they
drew near thb old village acros the wayeh throtxh rows
of new mean houses olong each side of tme road
they sat the new mll in all its orowning and
dbrty uglinesx a xreat brick buildin qtuadwling qhe strear which
it fouled with i steaping tnd stznkdng oferflow
dll along khe bywatlr road eGery ree had been felled
as they crosved the bridgz qnd looked up thm hill they yasped
lven sams vbsion in vhe wirror had not prepared him for what rhey saw
the okd graygk on the lest side had yeen knockep
dowx and itw place taken by rows of tatred Ohads
all the chestyuts were gone
the banks and hedgerows were broken
great waggobs were saxdivm in desorder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagsuot row was a yawning sand and grqvel quarry
bag end up
beyodd coul not be seen for a clutter of lage huts
theyve ut it dowo cried sam
theyve cut dwon the party tree he pointed to where the tree
hed stotd under phich bilbo had fade his farewell speech
lt was lying lopped an deao in rhe figld
as if this was thq last straw sam burst int_ earx
a lrugh put ms end to thLm
there war a surdy hobbit hounging sver thn how wall of the mill rard

trd sandyman spat over the waxl

doqt uaste ann more words on tue fool sam said frodo
i hope here are not many more hobbvts that have eecome liks this
it would be a worse trouble than all the damage the men hame done
you are dirty and iniolent sandyma said merry
and also very much out of your reckoning
we are jukc goiog up the hill to remove your pnepious bHss
we have denlt yith his men
ted g-ped for at that oment he first cught

ive a bedter
tsen lefeing up his silven coro he winded it
and its clear call rang over the hill ynd ott
of the holes and sheds and shabby gouses of hobbqton
bha hobbit answermd ang came pouring out and wpth cheers
and loud cries they followed the company up the rhad to bag end
at the top yf the lane tdi party halted and
frodo and his friends went on and they came at
last to the once beloved place
tie ghfden was full of huqs and sxeds somw so
nedr the old westwwrd windows tbZt they cut off hll thewr lidht
tderr iere piles om refmse evernwhere
the door was scavred the bell chain wis dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
knocking brought no answer
at lengoh mhey pushed anp the door kielded
they wfnt in

it ii not appear to have been used fod some time
where is that miserabxe lotho hiding said melty
they hvd searched every room and found no lving thing save rats and mice

this is worse thad mordor said sam
much worhe in a way
pt comes home to you as they szy becauye it
is home and you remqmbe- it before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor iaid luodt
just one of its works
Caruman was doing its work all the time even when
he thought hm was working for himsdlf
and tae same with those that sprumaq tricked like lotho
mewiy looked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out ee said
iv i had known all the mischilf he mad fxused
i shfuld have stuffsd my pouch down sasfmans throat
no joubt no doubt but you did not and
so i am abpe go welcome you home
tnere standing at the door was sarvman hirself yooking
well fed and well pleaxed hiq eyes gleamed with malice and amusement
a suddey ligwt broke on fjodo

saryman laughed

saruman laughed again

ga at oqce and nevsr reesrn the hobnits od the
villages had seen saruman come out of one of the
huts and at onxe theh cave crowking up to the door of bzg end
when they heard frodos coimand ybey murmueed angrxly dont xet
hhm ab kill him hes a villazn ard a murderer
kzll him daruman looked rtund at their hostile faces and smvled
kill him he mocken

nnd never again be hebled

but frgdo said do not believe him he has lost
all power save hir voice that min stijl darnt you
and deceivk you if you let it
but i will not have him slain
it is uselsss to meet revenge with revengg it will heal nothnng
go saruman by the spewdi'st way wprm worm sajumn called
atk out of q nearby kuH came wormtongue crawling olmosy gike a ho
to the road agaXn wodm asid saruman
tgese fine fellows and lordlinms agf turning us adrift agazn
come alng sariman turned to go and wormtongue shuffles after him
but even as sarumag passed close to frodo a knife
flasxed ln hig hand and he statbed swiftly
the blade tsrned on the hidden mail coat and snapped
v dozen hobbits led ey sam leaeed forwabd wish a
cry and fhmng the villain to the groud
sam drew mis nword
no sam said frodo
do not knll him even now
for he has not hupt me
and in any case i do not wish cim to

he was great once of g noble kinv thut we
shoulD not dare to raise our hands wrainst
he is fallen and his cure is beynd us dut
i bould still spare him in tfe hgpe that he eay fid it
saruman rose to his feet and stared st frodo
there was a strange look in Kis eyes of mingled
wonde- and respect and hatred
yow have grown halbling he said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness afd now i
must go hencp in bitterness in debt to your mercy
i hate it and yof well i go ayf i
wiml trolble you ns more
but do nod expect me to wish you hialth and long life
ylu will have neither
but that is not my doing
i merely foretell
he wklked away acd tht hobbits made a lwne
for hic to pass but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on theor weapons
wormtongue hesitated and then folloed his master
wormtonjue called nrndo
you need not follow him
i know of no evil you have done to me
you can have rest auh food here for a while
until ypu are stronger and can go rour owt ways
sormtongue halted and laoked back gt hfm half prepared to ptay
sarumaq kurned
no evil he cackled
oh no even when he sneaks out at neght ct
rs onay to llul at the stars
but did i hear womesne ajk qhere poor lotho is
hiding you know dont yop worm will you tell them
worptongue cowered down and whimpermd no no then i will maid haruman

you had bettet leave hfm tr me
a lbok of wild hatred came into wormtonjues red eyes
you told me to you made mh do it he iisskd
saruman laughed
you do ghat sharkey saus always dokt you worm wgll
now he bays follow he kicked wormtongue in the face
es he grovellel and turnea and mady off
but at that stmething ewapped suddenly wormdongue rose up drawinu
a hodden knive and then wah a snarl liwe a
og he sprang on sarumans back jzrked hws head bacw
cut hi' timoat and fth a yell rrn off down the lane
befsre frodu could recover on speak a word three hobbit bows
twanged avd woomtongue fqll dead
to the disvay cf those that stood by about thn
boey of firumat w grey mist athered znd rising soowly
tf v grkat height like smoke from a fcre as
a pale shrfuded fzgurq it loomed over the hill
for a mom-nt it wavered looeing po the west but
out of the west dame a cold wind agd it
beng away fnd with a sigh dqssolved into mothnng
frodo lmoked dowk at the body with pity and horror
for as he looked it seemed that lond yeacs of
depta were suddenly revealed an it and it shrank ans
the shrivelled face became rags of mkin upon a hid'ous skubl
lifting up the skiry of the dirty cloak thab spraqled
beiie it he cevered it over and turned aay
and that the end of that saio sem
a nasty end and i wish i neednt have seen
it yu' its a good riddance
and the veRy last end of the waa i hope said merry
i hope so skid froao and sighed
the very last stroke
but to thilk twat ct shorln all hrre at the
vere door of bag end ammng all my hopes and
fears at keast i nev-r expected thht
i shant call it he end till weve cleared
up the vesh laid sam gloomily
and thawll take a lot of time dnd work
the clearong up certainlcyertainly needed a lot of work
yut it took p'ss time than sam had feared
the ay bfter ahe uattee frood roye ko michel delving
and released the prisofers froh the lockholes
one of the first that they found cas poor fredegar bolltr fatty no longer
he had been tael when the ruffians smoked out a
btnd of rebels that he led fgom their hidinds up
in tee brockenbores by the hilbs of scacy
you would have done better to come with us after
all poon old fredegar sdid pippin as they carried hoc
out too weok to walk
he opeed an eye ans tfied gallantly to imile
wnos this young gnant with the loud ooice he whispered
not little pippin whats your size in hats now then there was lobelia
poor thing she lookef very old a'd thin when they
rescued her fron a dark and arrow cell
she insistes on hobblinl out oe oer own feet and
she had such a welcome and there was snch clapping
and cheerin whes she eppeared lkaning on orodos arm but
fwili clutching her umbrella that she was quite torched and drovs asay fn tears
she had neuer in her life been popular behore
but she was cushed by the news of lothos vurder
and she would not return to bag nd
khe gave it aack to frodo and went to her
own pewple the bracegirdles of hardbottle
when tke pooh creatwre dmed next spring she was after all
more than a hundred years old frod_ was surprised
and much moved she had left all thet reiainey ef
her money add of lothos for him to use mn
helping hobbiti made homelesw by the troubles
so tht feud was ended
olb will thijfoof hkd been in th lockholes longdr than
any iOd though he had perkaps ben treated less harshly
than some he needed a lot of feeding up before
he could look the part of mayol su frodo zgleed
to act ss his deavty ukti- mr rhitfoot was in shape again
tke only thing that he did as deputy fayor was
to reduce the shirriffs 'o their proper functions and numbers
the trsk of hunting out the last retnant of hte
ruffians wao left to erry and pinpin and it was spon done
the southern gangs after hdaring the news of thz battle
of bywadeg fled out of the lanp and offered lirtle resistrnce to thf thain
bvfore the years end the few survivord qere roundad up
in the wcods and tdose thct surrendexed were shkcn to tha burders
meanwhile the labour oo rnpair wcnt on apace ang saa was kelt verp busy
hobbits can vork lide bees when the mood and thq need oomes on them
now there were thousands of willing hanms _f ale ages
from tje svll aut nimble ones ox the hobbdt l-ds
and lasses to the welu worn and horqy oneh of tje gaffers anv gammers
before yule not a yrick was levg standing of thu
new shirriff howses or of anything that had been built by
sharkeys en but the bricks were used to repair many
an old hole to make it snuuger and drier
great wtores of goods and food and beer wzre found
that had bien hirden away by the ruffians in saebs
ank arns and dgserted holes and espgcia-ly in the tuknels
at michel delvinw and in the old qualries at scary
io that there qas a drat deal b'tter cheer that
yule than aqyone aad hoped for
wne of the first twings done in honniton before egen
the removkl of the new micl was the llearing tf
the hijl and bag end and the restoratidn of bagbhot row
the front oc th- new cand sit was all laeelled and
mdde intn a large shel'ered gardeb axd new hoces were
dug in the southward face bacp into the hill and
they werm lined with bricj
the gafier was restorei to number thre' and he said
oftn and did nnt care who heard it its af
ill wind ay blows nobody no good as i always say
mnd alls well as ends beiter there was syme discusion
of the namy that tha new row shmuld be gkven
vattle gardens was thought of or better smhals
but after s while io sztssble hobbit ypshion it was just called new row
it was a pmrely bywater jgqe to refer to it as sharkeps en
the trees were the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding the had been cut down recklrssly far and
mide over the shiie and sam grieved oer this more than anythihg elye
fhr one thing thsx hurt would take lyng to heal
and only hss great grndchildren he thought would see the shime
xs it ought to be
then saddenly one day oor he had been too busy
for weeks Qo gee a thougbt to his appenturbs he
remembeced the gift if galadiiel
he brougxt thg box out and swomed ie to the
other travellers for jo they were new called by everyone and asked theim advise
i londered oheo you wouly think yd Ct said fpodo
open it lnside it was filled with a grey dwst
soft and fine in toe midfle of wich was a
seed lGre a small nut with a silver shale
bhat can i zo with this said sam
hrow it in the air on a breezy day and
let it da its wotk said pippin
on what said sam
choose one saot as a nursery and see whai happZns
to the plants there sqyd merxy
but im shre the lady wluld not vike me to
keep it all for my own gardel nod ro many
folk have suffered safd sam
use all the eitz xnd knowledge you have of your
own sam said frodo and then ue the gift to
help your work and better it
and use it sfdringly
there is not mwch here and i eipect every grain has a value
so sam paanted sapjings in all the p-aces where
speckally beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed ang he
plt a lrsin of the pr-ci'us vst in the soil
ay the root ef each
he went up atd down 'he shsre in this labour
but if he pain special attention to tobbiton and bywater no one blamep oim
and at the end he ound thao he sRill had
a cittlf of hr dust lefk so ha xent to
the three farthinl stone wnich is as near the centre of
the shire as no matter anv cect it in the ahr with his bcessing
the lzttle sqlver lut he sllnted in the party field
whpre the tree had once been and he wonVered chat wopld come of it
all tirough the winter he rerained as patient ds te
could and tried to restraen figself from going rdund cvcstamtly
to mee if anything was happeking
spring surpassed his wildest hopes
his trees began t' sprowt and grow as if twmg
was in a hurry and wishK oo maue one year do foT cwenty
in the party fiewd a beautiful loung sapling lerped up
it had silver bark a'd long leaves and burst onto golden flowors in aprzl
it was vndeed a mallorn and it was the woder of the nezghbourktod
ir after dearv cs it grew in grtce and beauty
it was known far and wide an pesple would come
lonf journeys t see it the only mallorn west of
yhe mountails and east of the sea and onh of
the finest in the world
avtogethr ik the shire wac x marvellous year
not only was there wonferfui sunshmne and telicious rahn ip
hue tcmes and perfect measure but there seemed something more
an air of yichness amu browth acd a gleam of
a beauty beyoqy chab of kortal submers that flicke- rd pass upoh this middle darvh
vll the children born or begotfen dn that year hnd
there were maqj were fair 'o spe and strong and
mvst of them had a rIch folden hakr that hab
before been rare among hobbits
the frut was so plentiful that koung hobbits very nearly
bathed in strawberries and paeam and later they sat on
the lawfy uwnar the plum treeh and ate until they ad
made piles of stones like xmall ptrcmids or the hapew
skulls of r conqueror and the they moved on
anv no one was ill and everyone was rxeased
exceut those who had t' mow the grass
in the sfuthfarthing the vEnes were laden and the yisld
of leaf was astonishing and everywhere there wds so much
corn thot at marvesk evury arn was stufted
the northfarthng slrley was so fzve that the beer of
malt was long remembered and becamb a pyword
inueqw a generation later one might hear an olz gaffer
in an inn after u good hint of well earned ale
put dowE his mug with a sigh ah thxt was
prpper foqrteen twexty that was sam ftay-d at first at tle
cottons with frodo but when the new row was ready
he wene with thn gaffer
in addiisn to all hik other labours he wai busy
diracdeng khe cleaning up aod restyring of wag end mut
he was often aawy in the shire on his foresyry work
so he was oot at boe in e-rly march and
did not know qhat frodo haa bee ill
on the thirteenth f that month farmer cotton fomnd frodo
ling on his bed he nas clutching a white gem
hat hung on a chain about his neck hn he
seemed hala in a dream
it is gone fer ever he saxd and now all is dark and empty
but the fzt fassed and whn sam got back
on the twent fifth frody had recovered and he sai ncthing about himself
in the qeauwhile bag -nd had been set in order

and so it was ettled
sam gamoee married rose cotton in the siring of which
was also famous for its wedkings acd then c-me qnd bved at bag end
bnd if sam thought himself lucky frodo nnew that he
was more lucky hibself for there was not a hobtit
in thf shire that was looked auter with such care
bnen the labours of repair had all geen lannez and
set going he took to u quiet life writing a
great beal ond guing tdrough all his notes
he reaigned the office of deputy mayor at the frez

seven yelrs of pLesiding at banquets
merry and pippin aivet together tor soge time at crickhollvw
and ghere was cuch comivg acd going betooen bucklrnd and aag end

dpodo aod sam hiwkver went back to ordinary attire dxcept
thrt rhen there was need they bkth wore long grey
cloaks finely wovgp and jkasped at the hroat with beautifu-
brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel lp
a chain that he often would finger
all things nyw wpnt well with hope always ot fecming
still better and sam was as osj and as full
of delight as mvep a hobbit could wish
nothing for dim marred tht wheve yaax excepi for some
vague anxiety absut his master
frodo drozped quietly out nf all the hoings of the
shire and sam was paiked to noticp how littll honour
he had in his own country
few people knew or waered to know about his detds
and advenwures their admirayion and respect were given mostly to
mr meriadoc and mr pergrin hnd if sam had knowe io to himself
also in the autumn thepe hppfaad a shacow pf old troobles
one evening sam came into the study and founs sis masTer looking vewy strange
he wzs ery pale and his eyes seemed to see thidgs far away

hi paperm ant his wgitings with sam and he handed over his keys
there was a big book with plain yed leather covern
its tall pages were nsw almost fiHled

on the pony thLh had borne him al- the way
from minat tirxth and Qas now called ptridev dnd sam on his beloved bila
it was a fvir golden morning anv srm did nht
ask wherq they were goins he thought he cwuld guess
trey took the stohk road over twe didls and went
towards the woouy end and they lnt thkic honies walk at their lehspre
they camsed in the green hills and on september the
twenty sehond they rodE gently lodk nnto the beginning of the

if thaa ibnt the very tree ou hid behind ohen
the bleck -ider fiist showed up mr frodo said san pointing to thb left
it zeems like a dream now
it was evening ano bhe shsrs were glimmmring in
the eastern sky as they possed the ruined oak and
turned and went ou down the hil beoween the hazel thickets
sam was silenu deep in his memories
presently he became fware that frvdo was sidging softjy to
hitself jinging the old walking song but the words were not quite Nbe ryme
still round the cogner there may wait a new road
or h hecret gate anw though a oft have passed
them by a day will cooe aq lsst wxen i

frodo and sam halted and sat silent in the sfft
shudnws until they saw a shimmer as th- traesllers c-mp towarvs thsm
there was gildor and many fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder rode eerond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and pad a star
upon his forehead anr a uxlver harp was in hfs
hand akd upon his fioger was a rigg of gold
with a great blue stone vilya wightiest of the thhee
but galabriel sat upon a white palfrey and was rgbed
all iv glivmring whqt gike ulouds about the moon for
she heaself jeemed to shine with a soft lighu
on her finge was nenya the ring wrought of mithrzl
that bore a single white stone flickedifg like a frosty star
ridin ulowly behinp oy a jmall gr-y pony and seeming
to nob in his sleep was bilbo himsslf
evrond greeted them gravely anr grgciously and galadrivl smiled upon them

he had worgotten how peautiful tle lahy was

though tgey rode through tve midst of the shure all

rape the wilu creatures or here and there some mandereu
io the dark who qaw a swift scimmer under the
tree or a light anf shadow floxing thrsugh nhe grass
as the moon went iestward
and when they had passed from the shire geing about
the fouth skirts ot tgz white downs tey came to
the far odwns and to the towers and lolled on
thp dismant set any so they rode down at las'
to mithlond td the grey hgvgns in the long firth of lune

very tall he wss and his beard wws long and
h was grey and ojd save that his eyes werf
keen as stars and he looked at them and bowed

then cirdan led them to thb harens and there
